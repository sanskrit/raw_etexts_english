## LXVI

54 WEST 33rd STREET, NEW YORK,  
*May, 1895, Thursday*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

The classes are going on; but I am sorry to say, though the attendance
is large, it does not even pay enough to cover the rent. I will try this
week and then give up.

I am going this summer to the Thousand Islands to Miss Dutcher's, one of
my students. The different books on Vedanta are now being sent over to
me from India. I expect to write a book in English on the Vedanta
Philosophy in its three stages when I am at Thousand Islands, and I may
go to Greenacre later on. Miss Farmer wants me to lecture there this
summer.

I am rather busy just now in writing a promised article for the Press
Association on Immortality. 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
