The jinendra explained at length how the padmAvatI prayoga-s are
performed as per the padmAvatI kalpa. Described below is the vidhi for
padmAvatI ArAdhana:

Flower offerings are made with red karavIra and savR^inta flowers.

The great ShaDakSharI vidyA of padmAvatI is:  
OM hrIM hraiM hsklIM shrIM padme \! namaH ||

The so-called tryakSharI vidyA of padmAvatI is:  
OM aiM kliM hsauH namaH || (note its relation with the bAlA mantra of
shrIvidyA)

The so-called ekAkSharI vidyA of padmAvatI is:  
OM hrIM namaH ||

garuDa mantra: OM hrAM hrIM svAhA ||

Along with the padmAvatI ArAdhana the jinendra also routinely performed
a homa to sarasvatI and the shrIvidyA krama as per the nAstIka
traditions. The shrIvidyA of the nAstIkas corresponds to the
pa\~nchadashAkSharI of the kAdi-mata and is given concealed within a
remarkable mantraic stotraM known as the shrIvidyA garbha stotraM (SGS).
Their krama is relatively simple, done separately after the padmAvatI
worship and coupled with the vArAhI and rAja-shyAmalA mantras from the
padmAvatI kalpa. The SGS takes the place of the lalitA sahasranAmaM or
trishati in their tradition.
