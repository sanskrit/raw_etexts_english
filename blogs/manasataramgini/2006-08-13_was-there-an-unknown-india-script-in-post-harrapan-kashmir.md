Many interesting secrets have died with the indologist Hyla Converse of
Oklahoma SU. One of them was the famous shudra story that was published
by Arvind Sharma. But one thing that has remained a puzzle to me was her
study of an archaeological site in Kashmir, near Shrinagara. Her
exploration were at two exposures close to the city where the people had
dug a hill with nearly perpendicular cuts for obtaining soil for
cultivation. While examining the cut she noticed the following:  
\* The top-most layer was full of glazed ware and a plain red ware
porous thin walls which were typical of the medieaval period or the
Islamic period.  
\* Below this there were abundant pieces of the stamped red ware typical
of shunga-kushAna period.  
\* Below this she found few small sherds of the Northern Black polished
ware.  
\* Below this she found an abundance of “beautiful”, extremely
thin-walled, strong, well-fired, plain red ware, with a knife edge or
featureless rim. This ceramic was agreeable to touch and when shown to
archaeologist BB Lal he apparently remarked that it was the thinnest
redware he had ever seen. Also found in this layer was a grey ware
comparable to the Painted Grey Ware found in Hastinapura and Shahi Tump.
Then PGW layers of Hastinapura also had a thin-walled red ware similar
to that of her Kashmir site and Shahi Tump.

In the Hastinapura excavation sequence one observes the following:

\* The topmost layer has early medieval Moslem period ware (Period V).  
\* Next layer was the Stamped Redware of the shunga-kushAna period
(Period VI)  
\* The layer below that was the NBPW (Period III)  
\* The layer below that was the famous PGW (Period II) that emerged from
BB Lal’s pioneering excavations. This was dated by archaeologists to be
from at least 1100 BCE. Lal in those days thought it might correspond to
the Indo-Aryan. However, now Lal no longer believes it was the earliest
Aryan presence and subscribes to an Harappan Aryan theory.  
\* The lowest layer (Period I) is a coarse, “primitive” ochre colored
pottery:OCP (some indologists believed that this may be the ware of
invading Indo-Aryans who were supposed by as incapable of making any
advanced pottery).

In the more recent Abhaipur excavations in Uttar Pradesh by AR Mishra’s
team a slightly different stratigraphic sequence of the earlier layers
has been obtained:  
\* The PGW layer here was sandwiched between NBPW (above) and a Black
Red Ware (BRW) below it.  
\* Below BRW was found an OCP layer.  
Here the PGW was dated to 1100 BCE and BRW to 1500 BCE.

Thus, PGW has a fairly clear temporal boundary in different sites and
was also found to be accompanied by other wares like the thin red ware.
Hyla Converse, hence had rightly concluded that her Shrinagar thin red
ware corresponded to the the PGW temporal layer. But she makes a curious
statement about the Shrinagar pottery: “On some of the \[thin red ware\]
sherds appears writing of some kind. The Archaeological Survey
epigraphists to whom the sherds were shown stated that they did no
recognize in the writing any of the familiar ancient Indian writing
systems.”   
  
So what on earth was this supposed writing? After all modern mainstream
White indologists and their fellow travellers like us to believe that
Aryans never knew to write and there is an increasing tendency to
believe that the Harappan graffiti is not writing at all. They feel the
first confirmed writing is brahmi, which Hindus copied from the West. In
light of this the PGW level associated writing is definitely something
to investigate if real. The PGW were a village based people living in
mud houses and working iron.
