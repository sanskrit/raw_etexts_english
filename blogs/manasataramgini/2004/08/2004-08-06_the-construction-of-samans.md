title = "The construction of sAmans"

The gAnaM rules are thus constructed. First we define elements
corresponding to the padas of the R^ik, here a,b,c,d : 4\*11 in the
triShTubh example we are considering.

a=brahma jaGYAnaM prathamaM purastAd  
  
b=vi sImataH surucho vena AvaH  
  
c=sa budhniyA upamA asya viShThAH  
  
d=satash cha yoniM asatash cha vivaH

Then the musical stobhAs are defined:  
  
A= huve hA yi  
  
B= heShAyA  
  
C= au ho vA  
  
D= e R^itaM amR^itaM  
  
W=A+A+B

Then the gAnaM is specified as :  
  
W+a  b c d+W+C D+D+D  
  
1 2 3 4 5  
  
The parts of the gAnaM labeled 1-5 are refered to in the brAhmaNas of
the sAma veda by the technical terms:  
  
1 prastAva  
  
2 udgItha  
  
3 pratihAra  
  
4 upadrava  
  
5 nidhana  
  
This is one of the simplest gAnaM constructs.

This general rule may be construct other traiShTubha gAnaMs, though
different stobhas may be defined.

The satyaM class of chants- the song of the inviolable satya upheld by
deva mitra is defined thus:  
  
a=satya  
  
E= ho yi  
  
F= hA A vu vA  
  
G= e suvar jyotiH  
  
p=the praNava, oM  
  
Ganam:  
  
a.p a+E+a+E+a+F G  
  
a.p represent the insertion of the praNava into satya to give satyoM.

satya may be replaced by puruSha, agna, vAya, sUrya, chandra, nAkA,
shukra, to give rise through the same above formula to the 8 “space
filling chants”. These represent the equivalence between the elements of
space and the sacrificial altar. The adhvaryu lays the bricks with the
yajur brick chants. Even as he does so the udgAtA establishes with these
sAmans the equivalence with the inviolable satya, the puruSha that
pervades, heat (agna), atmosphere (vAya), the sun (sUrya), moon
(chandra), nAkA (the night sky) , shukra (Venus). Thus, completing the
identification of the sacrificial platform with these elements of space.

The sAman adopts the operator notation to represent cases where the
nidhana element may differ in the space filling charms.  
  
Thus, exactly like the Hamiltonian of mechanics, the ‘space filling
chant operator’, H is defined as :  
  
H(x)=x.oM x + ho yi+ x + ho yi+x+hA A vu vA e  
  
Then the new sAmans are indicated as:  
  
H(satya)+C1  
  
H(puruSha)+C1  
  
H(agna)+C2  
  
H(vAya)+C3  
  
H(sUryA)+C4  
  
H(chandra)+C5  
  
H(nAka)+C6  
  
H(shukra)+C7  
  
C1=suvar jyotiH; C2= jyotiH; C3=rAjA; C4=bhrAjA; C5=A bhrAjA; C6=
pR^iShThaM; C7= bhrALA bhrAjA
