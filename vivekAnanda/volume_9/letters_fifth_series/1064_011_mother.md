## XI

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

DETROIT

*February 22, 1894*

DEAR MOTHER

I have got the $200 for the engagements, $175 and $117 by private
lectures[1](#fn1) and $100 as a present from a lady.

This sum will be sent to you tomorrow in cheques by Mrs. Bagley. Today,
the banks being closed, we could not do it.

I am going tomorrow to lecture at Ada, Ohio. I do not know whether I
will go to Chicago from Ada or not. However, kindly let not Slayton know
anything about the rest of the money, as I am going to separate myself
from him.

Yours obediently,  
VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#fn1_1)When Swami Vivekananda realized that the Slayton Lyceum
    Lecture Bureau was cheating him, he began to arrange lectures
    privately, not knowing that Mr. T. W. Palmer who had gone to Chicago
    on his behalf, had broken the contract on the day this letter was
    written.
