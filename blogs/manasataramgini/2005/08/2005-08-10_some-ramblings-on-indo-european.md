title = "Some ramblings on Indo-European"

Due to a late night encounter back from work we got rambling about one
of our favorite topics the evolution of IE languages from PIE. Despite
the difficulties, that we are familiar with from other areas of science,
we have some idea of the phylogeny of IE. Below is the picture as we see
it today:

This made me drift back in time toward my ancestors who composed the
glorious mantras of the veda in the nascent days of Indo-Aryans. The
earliest of their compositions in the R^igveda appear to have happened
in the distant Uralic steppes and the allusions to the high latitudes
and dark winters still linger on though largely unrecognized by the
modern Hindu mind. Beyond lies the RUKI-SATEM clade which unifies I-Ir
with Balto-Slavic. This made me think more about the polycephalous
deities like Svantovit, Porevit and Rugevit and their iconography. What
does this mean for Indic iconography?
