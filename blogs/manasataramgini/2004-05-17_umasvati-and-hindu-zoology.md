title = "umAsvati and Hindu zoology"

**umAsvati**, the great jaina Acharya produced a remarkable work termed
the tattvArthAdhigama around 40 AD which contains one the great early
productions of Hindu zoology. umAsvati believed that all animals could
be classified into the following groups:

**Group I invertebrates:**  
apAdika = nematodes  
nUpuraka = annelids  
gaNDUpada = cnidaria  
shankha,shutika,samubuka= molluscs  
jalUkA=leeches

**Group II (“lower arthropods”)**  
pipIlikA  
rohiNikA  
upachikA, kunthu, tuburaka=bugs  
trapusavija, karapAsAsthikA=beetles  
shatapadi, utpataka=myriapods  
triNapatra (plant hoppers)  
kAShTha hAraka (termites and cockroaches)

**Group III (“higher arthropods”)**  
bhramara, varaTa, sAranga=hymenopterans  
makShika, puttikA, daMSha, mashaka=Diptera  
vR^ishchika, nandyAvarta=scorpions and spiders  
kITa=lepidoptera  
pata\~nga=orthoptera (locusts and hoppers)

**Group VI**  
The vertebrates know as tiryagyonis  
matsya=fishes  
uraga/nakra,godha,kUrma=crocodiles,lizards and turtles  
bhujanga=snakes  
pakshi=fishes  
jArayujAs=mammals

This shows that the ancient Hindus had a working knowledge of animal
diversity and a natural complexity based on biological organization.
While it may not be the most accurate classification of Animalia it
shows that the hindu world clearly encouraged the study of biology,
something which was sorely lacking in later day India.

The great ancient brahmANa zoologist **lAdyAyana** of a lost atharvan
shAkha presents a similar picture and made a particular study of
arthropods and “reptiles”. His entire text does not survive but
fragments preserved by dalvana present a clear picture of his meticulous
approach. lAdyAyana states :

kaTubiH bindu lekhAbiH pakshaiH pAdaiH mukaiH nakaiH shUkaiH
kaNTakalAngalaiH samshriShTaiH paksharomabhiH |  
svanaiH pramANaiH saMsthAnaiH li\~ngaishvApi sharIragaiH viShavIryaishca
kITAnAM rupagyAnaM vibhAvayate ||

In order to obtain knowledge of the classification of arthropods one
must carefully examine: 1) veins, spots and markings 2) wings, 3) legs,
4) oral appendages 5) mandibles, 6) antennae, 7) claws and spines 8)
abdominal stings 9) bristles on body and wings 10) sounds 11) structure
of organs, 12) genitalia 13) toxins and their actions.
