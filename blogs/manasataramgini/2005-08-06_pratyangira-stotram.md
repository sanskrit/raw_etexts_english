The stotra shrI pratya\~NgirA devI passed through the lineage of hoary
tantrics thus:

The trident-bearing shrInAtha and kaulinI roaming in kailAsha founded
the vidyA.  
This they taught to the ancient tantric khagendranAtha and his wife
vijayAmba.  
They taught it to the students of brahminical splendour first, viktaShTi
and his dame illAIambA from the drAviDa country and second, vimala and
his wife anantamekhalA. These were the pUrvanAthas  
Then it passed to the great tantric master of mantra vidyAs and
prayogas, kUrmanAtha, and his wife ma\~NgalAjyotI. They taught it to
jaitra and his wife also named illAIambA and avijita and his wife
AnandamekhalA. These were the dakShiNanAthas.

Then it passed to the great brahmin meShanAtha, knower of veda and
tantra, and his beautiful wife kAmama\~NgalA, the knower of the erotic
lores. They gave to it their student the mighty vindhya and his wife
kullAIAmbA and the yoga master ajita and his wife ajaramekhalA. These
were the paschimanAthas.

From them it passed for a while to the mysterious tantric of secret
rites, vR^ikShanatha who roamed the Himalayan fastness. From him it went
to the great ritualist mitranAtha. After him the tantric masters
committed a fatal error in the worship of kArttikeya. Enraged, the
six-headed god drowned the vidyAs in the ocean. There it was eaten by a
fish. The fisherman matsyendra caught the fish and having read the book
eaten by the fish acquired the great vidyAs as well as the great lore of
haTha yoga. Having acquired these lores he and his wife ku\~NkumAmbA
became the revivers of the tantra in this yuga. In addition to their six
sons, they initiated brAhmaNas and kShatriyas who furthered the tantra.
They were:  
amaranAtha and his wife sillA.  
varadeva and his wife eruNa.  
chitranAtha and his wife kumArI  
OlinAtha and his wife bodhA  
vindhya and his wife mahAlakShaNA  
guDikanAtha and his wife aparamekhalA

After them came oDIshanAtha who went from the Himalayan fastness to the
west coast of bhArata, where he was succeeded by shrIShaShThanAtha, the
great adept of the kaumAra lore in addition to shrI-kula and kAli-kula
tantras. He was succeeded by shrIcharyendranAtha.

Thus, is the line of tantric teachers.
