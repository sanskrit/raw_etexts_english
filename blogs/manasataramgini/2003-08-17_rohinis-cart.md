In Greco-Roman star lore the constellation Auriga is the charioteer.
Traditionally, in India too the constellation is refered to as the
sArathi, which means the same thing. The mainstream Western scholarship
has believed that this is a recent acquisition of the constellation name
from the Greco-Roman world.

If Auriga is the charioteer, where is his car? India star-lore records
an unsual name for the Hyades cluster in constellation of Taurus: rohINi
shakaTa: The cart of roHiNi (alpha Tauri) \[sUrya siddhAnta, 8.13\]. Not
surprisingly, the constellation is also called the shakaTa of prajApati
or brahmA \[ pa\~ncha siddhAnta 238-241\]. Traditionally, Hindu
astronomy records the star Capella (alpha-Aurigae) as brahma-hR^idaya
(the heart of brahmA). This suggests that the Hyades, which indeed look
like a simple cart was the cart of rohiNi or prajApati, thus linking the
cart to the charioteer. Hence, while lateral Greco-Roman influence
cannot be ruled out entirely, it is likely that the basic concepts
concerning this constellation go back to the misty Indo-European past
when Greeks and Indians shared a common ancestor.
