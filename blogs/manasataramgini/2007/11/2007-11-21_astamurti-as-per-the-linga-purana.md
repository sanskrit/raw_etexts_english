The concept of the aShTamUrti-s of rudra go back to the vedic period: 1)
In the gR^ihya rite of shUlagava. The 8 oblations to rudra in the
shUlagava are to the same 8 names of rudra. These are alluded to in the
brAhmaNa-s, gR^ihya sUtra-s and yajur vedic mantra pATha-s. 2) In the
atharvavedic sacrifice to rudra prescribed in the vrAtyakANDa of the
AV-S (15.5) invokes the aSTamUrti and pacifies them to prevent “bhava,
sharva or ishAna” from harming cattle. 3) baudhAyana dharmasUtra
prescribes tarpaNa-s to the aShTamUrti-s, their wives and sons. 4) The
offerings of the parts of the animal smothered in the great shrauta
rites like ashvamedha are made to rudra with 8 names, which include
among them rudra, bhava, sharva, mahAdeva and pashupati. The mantra used
for this is KYV-TS 1.4.36: chitta: sinews, bhava: liver, rudra:
pancreas, pashupati: diaphragm, agni: heart, rudra: blood, sharva:
kidneys, mahadeva: the mesenteries, uShiShThahana: intestines and lungs.

This concept remained vivid in the post-vedic period, in purANa-s,
coeval with the rise of the pAshupata based atimArga shaivaM and the
mantra-mArga shaivaM. For example it is alluded to in the mahimna stava
of puShpadanta from the paurANic period (although not specifically
attached to a particular purANa):

“bhavaH sharvo rudraH pashupatir athograH saha mahAn  
tathA bhImeshAnAv-iti yadabhidhAnAShTakam idam |  
amuShmin pratyekaM pravicharati deva shrutir api  
priyAyAsmai dhAmne praNihita-namasyo .asmi bhavate ||“

“bhava, sharva, rudra, pashupati, also ugra with mahat, furthermore
bhIma and IshAna, these eight appellations of the god, each of them the
shruti individually expounds, My salutations are to the dear abode in
which these names are laid (i.e. to one who bears these names).”  
Thus, the mahimna stava explicitly remembers the vedic origin of these
names of rudra alluding to their exposition found in the brAhmaNas (e.g.
shatapatha6.3.1, kaushitaki 6.1-3).

In the latter two shaiva streams there was more emphasis on the
pa\~nchabrahma compared to the aShTamUrti, though the siddhAnta stream
did recognize the icons of the aShTamUrti in their Agama-s.
