We felt we received a sign from the lord of ShaShThI, accompanied by
revatI and other hosts. It happened while exploring:  
Z\[n+1\]=Fn1(Z\[n+1\]); Z\[n+1\]=Z\[n\]-((P1\*Z\[n\]^4
-P2\*Z\[n\]+P1)/(4\*P1\*Z\[n\]^3));  
Fn1=ArcSin or Sinh; P1=1+i; P2=0  
The ShaTkoNa yantra manifested in the middle of the spanda.
