So, a man desirous of his goodness, should practise the virtues and moral conducts as ordained in the divine endowment considering it like nectar.

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तेज: क्षमा धृति: शौचमद्रोहो नातिमानिता।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Every brother and sister may be acquainted with these twenty-six merits of divine property and may know the way how to adopt it in his or her life, a story is quoted here to prove this motive—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There lived a Brahman in Prayag, his name was Deodutt. He was an extraordinary learned, of a simple nature and conduct and God-devotee. He maintained a dignified position among the royal affairs. His wife’s name was Gautami. She was very simple, innocent and of sweet nature but illiterate. She could not count from one to hundred even. She had three sons and one daughter.The eldest son’s name was Somdutt, the middle one’s Ramdutt and youngest son’s name was Mohan Lal. All the three sons were well educated and virtuous. The daughter’s name was Rohini. All of them were married. Rohini’s husband had died in the early of her age, and she was issueless, so she lived in her paternal house. The name of the sons wives were Rama Devi, Bhagavan Devi and Sushila respectively. The first two ladies of them were illiterate and fool; but Sushila was great learned; she was modest and chaste, proving worthy to her name. She was cool-minded, virtuous, endowed with good conduct, God-devotee and dedicated to her husband. She was apt in all the works and well cultured, educated one. She was expert in the art and craft as cutting, sewing, designing, embroidery on clothes, making men’s vest and sock, writing a good hand, and painting. She was distinguished for her characteristics of sacrifice, spirit of service, patience, efficiency, etc. Since Sushila entered the house, there came the excellence of house-management. She charmed every one to attract towards her by selfless service and thus, gained the favour of each and everyone. She behaved with everyone affectionately as one deserved. She gave due regard to her elders, she was affectionate and kind to the youngers and befriended the women of her age-group. The family members were already satisfied with her domestic works and modest nature, even the other men and women of the vicinity always used to praise her being impressed by her virtues. Though, Sushila was of young age newly wedded wife, but her merits got such a fame as the women from far and wide used to come to her for counselling and to take a lesson from her.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Pt. Deoduttji daily regularly used to practise the prayer at day break and twilight, Gayatri muttering, worship and meditation. He earned the livelihood of his family by delivering sermons, preaching the religious rites and performing the Brahman-work to his clients. His both the elder sons used to work in trading in the city and they handed over the entire earnings whatever they earned in the business to their father. The youngest son, Mohan Lal was a student in a college. Panditji used to give his wife some money required for the food-expenditure of the family every month for which she got the necessary materials brought from the market by her cook or the attendant. Taking Gautami quite simpleton in their minds, the cook and the attendant both committed theft and dishonesty. She used to give them whatever the money they demanded as the cost of the materials, they purchased and it is they who counted the money also; because Gautami did not know to count. They demanded the money for the purchase of domestic requirements and she gave them whatever the money they demanded and bringing some objects less than they charged for and used to say that the money she had given had been fully spent. Sometimes  they gave rough estimate, sometimes nothing at all. If they had given even, <span class="char-style-override-6">g</span>autami was too ignorant to know it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Intelligent Sushila took no time to judge their cunningness. She thought—On account of my mother’s  simple and innocent  nature, they are tricking out the money of our house. Some device should be found out to check this. Ultimately, she said to the cook one day—‘Maharajji (the cook)! Whatever the wheat, rice, pulse, vegetable, ghee, vegetable oil, and spices etc., you bring from the market, its account should be maintained.’ The cook said hawling—‘Oh enough! Is it you to maintain the account? Here, everything is maintained on faith in usual course. Your mother-in-law is so aged, but the poor lady never asked for the accounts and you have come to this house just yesterday and started querrying about the account from us, the family members? It seems that now, it is you to be the mistress of this house.’ Such insulting harsh words to the daughter-in-law by the cook, fell into the ears of Pt. Devduttji who was sitting in the adjoining room. Addressing the cook he said in a natural way with patience—‘Brother! My daughter-in-law is right to say. It is not proper to grudge and rebuke on her simple statement. It is not good at all that you don’t give the account of expenditure. The account of the money should be maintained to pice exactly and accurately. Now, in future, whatever is there, you will tell her clearly. She is educated, she will write down the account of the money given and spent and returned.’ He said to his daughter-in-law again—‘Daughter! Your mother-in-law is simpleton. Now, it is you to maintain the account of the household expenses.’ Sushila did want this. She, now, began to maintain the account of the expenditures. Whatever the materials were brought from the market by the cook and servant both, she used to note it down asking from them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the family members whether male or female were highly charmed because of her nature and attributes, but the selfish cook and the servant began to feel hostile, considering her the hinderance of their path. They began to pick holes through and through and began to spoil the minds of the other female family members. Sometimes they passed on taunting remarks also—O! This Sushila is now holding her commands on all of you. Just see! She came after you and now she has started commanding all of you. But they said—‘This poor does act upon our orders and she is very modest, why do you blame her always?’ But they were bent upon her back-biting. Whenever they got opportunity, they used to provoke the family members thursting upon false blame on her. Inspite of it there was no sign of distraction or restlessness in her mind, she used to remain always cheerful, but other women were fool. So, by hearing their repeated and repeated comments they began to be influenced slowly and slowly. Taking the words of the cook and servant, true, those women also began to speak so many untrue things against Sushila to the male members of the family also in different ways, but because of being impressed by the virtuous qualities of Sushila, the male members did not pay heed to their words at all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some time a daughter was born to Sushila, who was named Indraseni. After two years, a son was born to her who was named Indrasen by Panditji. After some time of the son’s birth, Somdutt and others, having invited the relatives, friends and other well-wishers, received them warmly, serving them with the sweet of the market, Bidi and <span class="char-style-override-6">c</span>igarette etc., and all began to play playing cards and a game like draughts played with three dice and began to create roar amusing with each other. The tumult was created in the house. Seeing all this, Sushila requested modestly—‘Why are such activities performed?’ The family members said—‘This is the prevailing custom here. The ceremonies are performed for the protection of the child.’ With folded hands the daughter-in-law said—‘It creates a bad mental impression, there is waste of money and by roar and noise I feel deprived of sleep also. So, as regards myself, I don’t find any advantage except only loss. There is a very good custom at my paternal house. There just after the naming ceremony, the verses of Gita and Vedas are sung and recited. The religious fables are related and reverential songs are sung. The fables of devouts, devotees, donators, philanthropics and brave persons are related which impart a very good lesson. So far as I am concerned, it is my earnest request to you that such frivolous activities should be stopped.’ Sushila’s these humble words had a very good impression on them. Having stopped all these activities, all the arrangements according to Sushila’s suggestions were made.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In absence of any other son in the family, Gautami  had a great attachment with the son. She tied black coloured thread on his hands and feet and caused a festoon to be worn in his neck in which the tiger-nails, the ring of shellack and iron, amulet and Jarnakh etc., were stringed. After sometime, those threads were fastened to the wrist of his hands and feet so deeply that it created mark on its place of the body and that festoon created spots at so many places of the chest and back of the body. Observing this Sushila said to her mother-in-law—‘Mother! Why have these threads been tied to the hands and feet of the child? It will make his hands and feet weak and it has created marks also and this festoon pricks his body in the night and it has also created mark at so many places of his body. What is the advantage to attach it to the body?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Gautami said—‘These are tied to protect the child from the influence of the evil eyes of Dakini, Putana etc.’ Sushila asked—‘You never got Indraseni to wear all these?’ Gautami replied—‘It is the Lord who protects the girls. So, there is no need to tie all these to them.’ With folded hands Sushila said very humbly—‘Mother! The Lord protects everyone. The God who protects Indraseni, will protect him also. Why should we worry so much? contrary to it, such activities create the feeling of disbelief in God and at the same time there appears no gain even.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sushila’s these logical words appealed to Gautami and she took out the festoon from his neck and the thread from his hands and feet. </p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-2">(2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After sometimes passed, it was the occasion of Kumbh fair at Haridwar. All young ones jointly made a proposal before Panditji—‘If you permit, let us move to Haridwar on the occasion of Kumbh fair.’ Panditji said in reaction—‘It is certainly nice, I will also accompany you.’ Then, there was no question of delay, in no time the preperations were made and having arranged the household affairs, the entire family set out. While starting Sushila requested all of them—‘In the fairs, the cheaters, thieves and back-biters and plundurers also generally come there, let us be quite alert from them. Let us not make the relation with any strange whether man or woman. Let us not accept anything given by others and at the same time let us not believe any unaquainted or stranger. It is proper to have control and to be very cautious about eating and drinking, and the patience and wisdom should be applied always. Not to become weak or coward before anybody but the capital should be made out with patience, zeal and courage.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the way, all of them thought of halting at Ayodhya and take a holy bath there and take an eye-view there. There, they stayed at a public inn. Having taken bath in the Sarayu river, all of them took a view of the gods in the temples and again they came back to their public inn. The cook was sitting on a restroom out of the public inn. Approaching there a cheat said to him—‘I just give you a spice, if you mix it with the pulse, it will be cooked very nice and those who taste it, will come under your power.’ Evidently, the cook was a fool, he took that spice from him and mixed some of it in the pulse and put the rest in a small paper packet separate. When the meal was prepared, Somdutt and Ramdutt both the brothers, Indrasen, Indraseni and the sister Rohini took the meal. No sooner than they took the meal, they got fainted. Seeing this, Sushila came to decide that undoubtedly, there was some defect in the meal otherwise how had  all of them got fainted?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At once, she entered the kitchen and there she found that there was thorn-apple seed in a small paper packet. She asked the cook—‘What did you feed today that all the eaters got fainted?’ The cook said—‘Nothing’. Sushila said—‘If nothing, then, how did they got fainted? Tell the  truth, otherwise legal action will be taken against you.’ Saying this she showed the thorn-apple seed and said—‘Why has it been brought?’ The cook said—‘A gentleman had come, he gave Rs. twenty in donation and gave this spice with assurance that by mixing it with the pulse, it would be a fine pulse cooked and all would be pleased to eat it. I did not see the spice, I mixed of it a little part with the pulse and kept the remaining in a small paper packet.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sushila at once reported the entire matter to her husband and requested him for the immediate treatment. Mohan Lal said it to Panditji. Panditji got shocked and astonished to hear it. Immediately, he managed to call in a good doctor for the treatment and then, calling the cook, he rebuked and threatened him—‘You had thought to kill us, you should be handed over to the police.’ On his threatenning, the cook begged for pardon from him. Then, forgiving him Panditji said—‘Never play such a mischief with anyone in future.’ In the meanwhile, the doctor reached there and the timely treatment saved their lives. None but all praised Sushila.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day, they again started to journey. Their train reached Jwalapur. The children were thirsty, Sushila got down the train to make them drink water. In the meantime the train started and she remained at the station. The family members pulled the chain, but on account of its not being in proper order, the train did not stop. Pandit Devduttji and others reached Haridwar. There was no room available in the city due to rush, so, they stayed in a tent on the bank of the river Ganges; but they got restless in the anxiety of the seperation of Sushila with the children and began to make her search. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the other side, Sushila was not the least disturbed. Placing the children in her lap, she came to Haridwar from Jwalapur walking on foot and stayed in a temple. She narrated her whole occurances to the learned priest in Sanskrit language. Her knowledge had a great impact on the priest. He allowed her and provided her place to stay there. Then, she got a number of blank papers and wrote down about her coming from Jwalapur and staying in the temple on the paper, and wrote the address etc., of the temple. With the support of the priest and by the altruistic volunteers those advertisements were pasted on the different important places of the city and the information was given to the police. Due to this, the news spread all around very soon. The family members were already searching out, Just knowing her clue, they visited the temple and brought her. The family members felt very much delighted to see her wonderful competence and patience.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On account of the great rush in the fair, they didn’t get pure milk and they had to stay for some days more, so a cow was purchased for two hundred rupees and they began to live there comfortably. They used to guard remaining awakened in the night turn by turn. It is the matter of a day, Sushila was at the watch, it was four O’clock in the morning. At that time a thief came and began to take away the cow untying it. Sushila was a great fore-sighted. She had already got a bell reserved in the tent and had told the family members from the time before that—‘if any thief etc., happened to come or any misery was caused, she would ring the bell loudly.’ It is shy to make a loud cry and keeping mum without giving any information, the misery is not removed, the thief takes away the property; so Sushila had already managed so keeping it in mind from the earlier. She saw the thief and without wasting the time, she began to ring the bell very loudly. Just hearing the ring of the bell, the family members got startled and all shouted collectively—‘What is the matter? What is?’ In this duration the thief ran away. On this witty tactfulness of the daughter-in-law, all were highly delighted.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When it was the festival of Kumbh, all of them proceeded to take bath on the ‘Hari ki Paurhi’. Because of the heavy rush, many pilgrims died due to stampede on the way, but the intelligent Sushila leading the family members safely from the crowd walking on the side paths took them to the bank of the river Ganges. Having taken bath in the Ganges, all reached their camp. Then after on one or two days, they came back to Prayag and began to live as usual at their residence. </p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-3">(3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, it was the day of full moonlit night of summer. Sushila was walking on the roof of her house. The mistress of the neighbouring house also had come on the roof of her house. She was a rich widow Brahman by caste. She had two sons. The first one was aged sixteen and the second one was three years old. The roofs of both the houses were close, so Sushila saluted her going in front of her. She was very quarrelsome. She said—‘O why, You are only a little educated and  so you are making my fun?’ Sushila said—‘No, not at all. I saluted you considering you like my mother and mother-in-law.’ She said—‘Well! Then, very tactfully you want to make me wife of your father and father-in-law? Let your father and father-in-law deprived of son who want to make me their wife, I will burn their beard!’ She began to abuse in this way and coming down from the roof she began to shout coming out of the house. When the passers by and many neighbours gathered there, she began to say them—‘Just see the impudence of this girl! She makes me the wife of her father and father-in-law.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Those who were the well-wishers of Sushila went to her having heard the different types of abuses, and advised her—‘get it reported to the police against her through your husband. The court will take a personal bond from her. None can abuse anybody unnecessarily.’ Then, with folded hands very humbly Sushila persuaded them affectionately—‘To go to the police-station is not the job of noble persons. Just wait and see, if God wishes, in a very short time I will win her with love.’ All present there, were very much pleased to see her modest unmalicious, co-operating and helpful friendly behaviour, free from hostility and went away. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If so happened one day, that the three years old son of that quarrelsome lady, was playing on the road. At the same time, two bulls came near him while fighting. Sushila happened to see it. Rushing fast she brought the child in her lap and going to her female neighbour said—‘The child should not be left on the road alone. Two bulls were coming fighting. I have brought him lest they should harm the child.’ On this the quarrelsome lady said—‘Don’t oblige! Why did you bring it? I, myself, would have brought him.’ Sushila said—‘If I brought, what was my harm?’ Saying in this way, seating the child near her, she came back to her house. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a rich Brahman in the paternal place of Sushila. He had a great reverence for <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>ushila. He sent a messanger to Sushila regarding the engagement of his twelve years old daughter. The matter of the engagement was going on with the elder son of the same quarrelsome lady. Someone of the city said to the quarrelsome lady—‘A Brahman of Sushila’a paternal town has come to her to enquire about your son’s engagement.’ Hearing this, the quarrelsome lady got startled and said—‘She is not on good terms with me and always remains hostile to me.’ Having said this, she stood at the gate of <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>ushila’s house, hiding herself and began to listen to the conversation between the Brahman and Sushila secretly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman said to Sushila—‘The friend of your brother has sent me here having faith in you. In your vicinity, the widow Brahmani has a sixteen years old son. What is your advice regarding the engagement of his daughter with him?’ Sushila was well acquainted with all the conditions. She thought that the both were rich women and both were quarrelsome and of quarreling-mind. Taking it into consideration she said to the Brahman—‘This engagement is suitable for him from all point of view.’ The Brahman asked—‘The mother of the Brahman lad is known as a very quarrelsome lady.’ Sushila said—‘Now a days, there is  quarrel and hostility in every family due to ignorance. That is why, it has become the nature of the common to reproach each other. In my opinion he should settle this engagement as it is good and suitable.’ With this message, the Brahman went away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The quarrelsome lady remained listening to the entire conversation from beginning to the end. Sushila’s this behaviour had a very good impact on her. She went inside the house near Sushila and began to say humbly— ‘Sushila! Really, you are auspicious one. As regards myself, I have always given you ill-treatment but even then you always do good to me. Sister, I am charmed with your this behaviour, where have you learnt it from? Is it possible that my nature may also change like yours? I want to befriend you. May I come to you from time to time?’ Sushila replied—‘Why not. This is also your house. It will be a matter of good luck for me if you visit here. It is your grace and love to me.’ She became very happy and began to visit Sushila off and on. Sushila’s company began to impress her and only after a short time she also turned to be of noble nature like Sushila.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Watching such a wonderful change in the quarrelsome neighbouring lady, the Sushila’s well-wishers, who had advised her to report to the police, sometime before, now began to say coming to Sushila—‘Sushila! It is a matter of great strange that you changed her like yourself.’ Sushila said—‘It is all God’s mercy.’ Those well wishers again said, ‘How praiseworthy you are! Really, we were at fault to advise you to report to the police against her.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days passed, the marriage was settled. She invited all the members of Sushila’s family earnestly and pressed them to participate. All the male members of Sushila’s family went to attend the marriage party for three days. In the meantime, the theft was committed in the house of a trader in that very street. So, the Police inspector (Kotwal) came with the merchant and entered the house of Panditji and said—‘I have come to search your house.’ Hearing this all the female members of the house got perturbed, then, Gautami said—‘Daughter-in-law! The police has come. Their coming at the house is not good. Anyhow, depart them by giving some money.’ Sushila said—‘Don’t worry; I myself will set right everything.’ Again Sushila began to say to that trader—‘Why sir! Do you want to disparage my family by getting searched the house in the absence of the male members? Have you suspicion in your mind that the objects of theft are there hidden in my house?’ The trader said—‘No Deviji! I don’t want so. These policemen have brought me here.’ Then, Sushila said to <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>otwal fearlessly—‘Why Kotwalji! Have you come to make search of my house?’ The Kotwal said—‘Yesterday there was burglary in the house of this businessman. So, we have come here for search.’ Sushila said fearlessly—‘Allright! Please, give me in writing that—‘I am making the search of your house of my own choice—‘After the search is over and if nothing is recovered, against whom will I file the suit of my infamy and who should be held responsible for it?’ Hearing this the <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>otwal got alarmed and said—‘It is this businessman who has pressed me to come here and he denies having arrived here.’ In this way, excusing each other, all of them went away from there. When the male family members returned from the marriage party, they were overjoyed to hear this and they began to pay more honour and respect to Sushila.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-4"><span class="char-style-override-7">(4)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, the male members of the family began to pay much more respect and honour to Sushila. This dignified position of Sushila in the family stirred the feeling of jealousy among the other female members. They began to vex to her to themselves. They began to find fault with her to humiliate her; but Sushila had no fault at all, it was she who always served others and used to praise others for their merits. She never paid attention to the demerits of others. So, they didn’t find any way to defame her. Viewing such attitude of the female family members, the cook and the servant thought of taking benefit of the situation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, all the female family members and the cook and the servant jointly hatched a consipiracy. A plan was made and in accordance with the plan a false rumour was spread by Ramadevi that her bangle of gold had been thieved and she created her doubt on Sushila. The male members of the family did not believe in it. After a few days, the sister Rohini made a false propaganda that her petticoat and Sari had gone. Then, the male members got astonished a little, how such thefts have started taking place daily. The investigation was made, but no clue could be got. Then again just after four days, Bhagavan Devi said that her necklace of gold was missing since night. The family members made their best efforts to investigate, it was all in vain. How was it possible to be found out, as the owner, herself, used to keep the thing in the hidden place. All the female members of the house created their doubt on Sushila.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same street, an old woman, named Bhakti Devi lived there, whose paternal house was there in the neighbourhood of Sushila’s father and she had a great love for Sushila’s mother.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through the servants, the news came that Bhakti Devi was about to go to her paternal house the next day. On this, all the female family members, the cook and the servant made a conspiracy. All the four objects which had been rumoured to be lost, were packed in stitched cloth packet and the packet was sent to Bhakti Devi by Rohini through the cook and along with it she gave a letter also. The text of the letter was—‘Salutation to mother by Sushila. This packet is being sent through Bhakti Devi. Let it not be leaked out to anybody at any cost.’ Approaching Bhakti Devi the cook said—‘Take it, Sushila has sent this packet to her mother and she has instructed to hand it over to her mother only and none else.’ Having said this the cook returned to the house.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The same night, Rohini called all the men and women of the house together except Sushila and said to them—‘We have doubt on Sushila about the things of the house which are missing for the last many days. The resident of this Mohalla, the old woman Bhakti Devi has a great love for Sushila’s mother. She is about to go to her paternal house tomorrow. Perhaps, Sushila has sent something to her mother through her. It is tomorrow, the next morning, she will go and she will pass from the front of our house. Then stopping her on the way, she should be interrogated and her all the possessions should be checked up what items Sushila has sent.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day, in the morning, Sushila’s husband Mohan Lal sat down at the gate of his house and remained waiting for Bhakti Devi. When Bhakti Devi was passing on with the packet, Mohan Lal checked her and said—‘O the old mother! What object you are carrying?’ Bhakti Devi said—‘Sushila has sent a letter and a packet to her mother.’ Mohanlal said—‘It is not to be sent. Give it back to me.’ Saying this he took that letter and packet from the old woman and said—‘Now, you may go.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After then, Mohan Lal presented that letter and packet before the male family members there where they were present and quoted the old woman’s words what she had said, before them. When the packet was opened and inspected it was found that all the four things that had lost, were found in that packet. Then again when the letter was read, all grew red in anger. Being terribly enraged, Mohan Lal entered the house and began to scold Sushila in abusive language—‘O scoundrel! Get out of my house. It is you to steal all the things of the house. The arrangement to send the packet and letter to your mother through the hands of Bhakti Devi, made by you, was caught red handed. At any cost, I don’t want to keep a thief like you in this house. Go away wherever you wish.’ Hearing the totally false and unexpected blames, Sushila came to tremble, tears began to flow out of her eyes; she said in a great pathetic voice—‘Lord! Believe in me, I have not done this. God is witness. Kindly, ponder over seriously and patiently all the ins and outs. Just do ask that old woman who gave her the packet and the letter. Just mark minutely and carefully the hand-writing  of the letter whose hand is it: You should scruntanise it completely.’ But Mohan Lal had gone mad in anger. It was the great cause of his mental shock that his wife did such a vicious work. A man looses his discrimination in wrath automatically. What is the need of scrutiny, the proof is evident. Being irritated he said—‘Don’t you feel ashamed of while justifying. You have thurst upon me an indelible blackspot. You stigmatised my face; which can never be washed away. I don’t want to see your face even, Go, get out at once from here.’ Sushila said beseeching and made many pressing earnest requests, but he paid no heed and turned her out of the house. Indrasen was four years old  then and Indraseni was aged six. The grandmother kept them with herself. The consipirators the cook, the servant and the female family members were feeling overjoyed on the success of their planning. They were laughing and boasting—‘We already knew that she was bragging, she was certainly a mean, but she had hyptonised everyone and now everything got exposed.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even on such an ill-behaviour, Sushila neither felt the least annoyed at all nor there was any sentiment of retaliation in her. She began to curse her ill luck instead of blaming anyone. She thought—‘When my husband, himself is giving up me, thursting upon false blame on a faultless innocent like me, then what is the use of my life? But according to the ordains of the Shastras, it is only the husband who is the pilgrimage for a woman, it is only the husband who is vow and everything. Considering it and keeping it in mind I should remain contented with the Lord’s dispensation and maintain patience always. Misery falls on everyone inevitably. A wise being must not give up patience and morale in any condition.’ Lord Shri Krishna has said in the Gita—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दु:खेष्वनुद्विग्नमना: सुखेषु विगतस्पृह:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">वीतरागभयक्रोध: स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(2/56)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The sage whose mind remains unperturbed amid sorrows, whose thirst for pleasures has altogether disappeared and who is free from passion, fear and anger, is called stable of mind.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">धीरज धर्म मित्र अरु नारी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आपद काल परिखिअहिं चारी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Patience, righteousness, friend and wife are tested in the days of misery.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So, to give up the life in the flurry of sorrow is not a wise step. By this action, neither this world nor the next world after death is beneficial. So, the sorrow of leaving the house at present will be doubled at the time of suicide. The person who enters the river to give up his life, feels so much tormented at that time that he makes his best efforts to come out of the river to save his life again. In the same way, anyone who takes poison to die, tries to make the poison inaffective to live the life again and the person who sprinkles the kerosine oil on his body and burns it to die, really, dies shocking, crying and drawing in his breath. It is not so, that he suffers the misery in this world only, even after death, he has to suffer the tortures of murky dungeons and hells and becomes the victim of sad plights. </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Those worlds which are sunless and are enveloped in blinding darkness, to which all these people who commit suicide, so aftet departing from here.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It does not end here only, it becomes the cause of great disgrace for ever to the both families of her father as well as of her husband. It is a matter of great shame to me. For the virtuous woman it is a matter of great infamy even to resolve to commit suicide. So, I will not forsake my life. There is justice in the God’s court and I am at all blameless and true. If I remain alive, a day will come when all the blames will automatically be washed away. How long will the lie stand? It has no meaning as regards myself, even Shri <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>rishna had been charged of committing the theft of gems falsely, but it did not stay long. Thinking in this line, she bore patience in her heart and bearing the distress come of its own accord, she absorbed herself in discharging her moral duty and self-mortification and began to find out the way to earn her livelihood.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">At the evening, she stayed in an inn. She used to meditate on God daily as a result of it her inner-sense became sanctified, controlling her senses and mind, she used to study Gita and Ramayana daily and used to mutter the holy names of the Lord and used to pray to God piteously in her mind for the purity of her husband’s thoughts having no malice at all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">She had five rupees on account of the domestic affair amount. With this remaining amount with her, she thought of the future planning of her life. The next day, she spent four annas for big needle, quarter to two rupees for coloured thread, eight annas for flour, pulse and spice, four paise for leaf bowl and plate of eatables and two rupees and seven annas for one bucket and one small Pan. Having purchased all this, she brought it. She knead the flour in the small Pan she prepared the loaf of bread on backside of the Pan. Having placed the loaf of bread on the plate, she cleaned the Pan, cooked pulse in it. In this way, she prepared her food. After taking her meals, she made the men’s vest and socks of the threads in the day which she sold in the market and earned three rupees and half. In this way, she began to earn quarter to two rupees daily. She spent twelve annas on the food materials of two times and used to save one rupee. After fifteen days, when she had saved fifteen rupees, she managed for a rented house on the rent of rupees five per month. She purchased more kitchen utensils for five rupees and bought thread for five rupees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then after Sushila got it announced in the city that if anybody was intrested for embroidery work on the Saree, peticoat, bed-sheets, long loose skirt of women, wrapper and shawl etc., or if anybody wanted to get verses or couplet written on the sheet of clothes as mentioned above, he might send it to her house. The people began to send to her. Seeing very attractive couplets, Hindi verses, Dohas etc., written by her and embroidery etc., the people began to be charmed by her artmanship and education. By this business Sushila began to earn about one hundred fifty to two hundred rupees per month. After one year, she opened a girls-school in a big rented house. She began to teach many girls grammar, the <span class="char-style-override-6">g</span>ita, the Ramayan and Hindi, Sanskrit books free of any fees. She taught them the skill of art and craft also along with imparting them knowledge and education. Whatever the things they prepared there, they used to sell it in the market and by this way, there used to be the saving of two hundred rupees per month. Thus, after one year, excluding all the expenses, she made the saving of two thousand rupees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After that having purchased a land she got a ‘<span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>achha’ house built and purchased a cow and also appointed a servant  who used to do all the domestic works and tending of the cow. In the course of doing so, she saved five thousand rupees the next year.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The third year, having purchased the silken cloth, the cotton cloth, the yarn etc., of her own and having got the verses of the <span class="char-style-override-6">g</span>ita-Ramayan, couplets, dohas written on it and with beautiful embroidery work on the clothes, she began to make the sale and purchase truthfully and in the justified way and alongside it, she continued to do the works of those also, who came to her to get the hymns, couplets and Hindi verses written and for the embroidery work on the clothes. Her truthful, justified, humble and affectionate behaviour began to impress the people very much. Her behaviour had a very good impact on them. By this business, thus, she saved fifteen thousand rupees and excluding all her expenditures she began to save about one thousand rupees per month. In this way, due to the increase of her income, she earned a good name and fame in the city. So, she began to lead her life like a rich man with respect and dignity. She got a <span class="char-style-override-6">p</span>akka house also built on her land and appointed many men and thus, her business began to flourish by leaps and bounds. Her character and merits were already pious, spotless and worth respectful, and her modest dealing with others also spread her fame. She had the feeling of great pity in her heart for those who were poor, afflicted, helpless and disabled. So, she began to donate food materials, clothes etc., according to their needs to them with selfless motive. After preparing her meal, daily having offered the food to the Lord she performed Balivaishvadeva without Mantras then first she fed the guests and then in the last she used to take her meal. </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">On the other side, the people began to condemn her father-in-law, mother-in-law and the elder brother of her husband etc., due to turning virtuous Sushila out of the house and on account of mutual inharmony in the family and on account of poor understanding, the family property began to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was one day, when a woman of the same Mohalla came to Rohini and said—‘I am in urgent need of fifty rupees. If you may lend me, I will pay you two percent interest, considering her of a good family, she gave her fifty rupees. She went away home with the money. After a while she again came back and giving her one rupee, she said—‘You have counted fifty one rupees in place of fifty rupees so I have come back. Please, take your one rupee.’ It made a good impression on Rohini. She took the money and thought—‘She is a good women belonging to a good family. It had passed hardly fifteen days when she returned her fifty rupees and she gave one rupee more also as the interest of the money to Rohini.’ Then, Rohini said—‘You may keep this money with you for a few days more also.’ She said, ‘When I need, I will take it, at present, I have no need.’ Saying so, she went away. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days, she came again and said—‘Today, I am in need of two hundred rupees, can you lend me?’ Rohini gave her the money without taking time. After ten days only, that woman returned her two hundred and four rupees including the month interest of four rupees. It strengthened Rohini’s trust in her.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days, she again came and began  to weep. On Rohini’s querry, she said—‘The marriage ceremony is to be held in my family. What should I do? My entire ornaments have been mortaged by my family members and without the ornaments the participation in the marriage ceremony is a matter of great insult. So please, lend me your ornaments only for three days to wear on the occasion so that, my prestige may be saved.’ Rohini had already faith in her. She handed over her entire ornaments to her. The woman went back to her house with the entire ornaments. But when she didn’t come for five days, Rohini went to her house, and asked her—‘Sister! Was the marriage ceremony performed?’ That woman said—‘There was no marriage of anyone in my family at all.’ Rohini said—‘There was the marriage function in your family and you had come to me for my ornaments.’ She answered—‘Neither there was any marriage function in my family nor had I any need of ornaments. I, myself, have got sufficient ornaments, why would I go to you for the ornaments?’ Rohini said—‘You came to me several times, there was the exchange of money also between us many times, and today, you are telling lies before me in this way.’ She said—‘Well enough! Whether, I am telling lies or you are telling a lie, I, myself, lend money on interest, I have no short of money, why would I have gone to you for the money? In my family, if there is the need of money this affair is fulfilled by the male members of my family. All the financial dealings are made by the male members of my family here. If the male members of this family, come to know it, you will be defamed and humiliated.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing her words, Rohini was taken aback. She came back to her house and being agrieved she began to weep before her father and brothers. Hearing her words, her brothers and father asked—‘Is there any written proof of the ornaments that you gave her? And at that time was there anyone as witness?’ Rohini said—‘I had given her the ornaments in faith, I didn’t prepare any written proof and there was none present as witness.’ The father and the brothers said—‘If there is no written proof and not even any witness then, there is no wayout. You were not expected to do such a work without asking from us beforehand.’ All were stunned by grief.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, a cheat disguised in the form of a hermit came to Panditji. Panditji received him warmly. The hermit asked Panditji—‘Is there everything all right?’ Panditji said—‘Since, the youngest daughter-in-law has left the house, there remains always the quarrelsome and miserable atmosphere in the family. The source of livelihood has also been badly affected because of the disgrace of the family in the society. The business of the sons has also been stopped because of the loss in the speculation and there came no chance for Mohanlal’s business.’ The hermit said—‘Just, I give you the knowledge of a chemical by the means of which you can make the gold weighting two massas (equal to 8 rattis) daily; but you should not be too greedy.’ The disguised hermit again said—‘Well! bring the arsenic for four annas, sulphur for four annas, mercury for four annas, one melting pot and some coal from the market.’ He brought it at once. That cheat took out some leaves of leafy green vegetables from his bag and giving the touch of arsenic, sulphur and mercury with its essence, he got it poured down into the melting pot with coal, he lit the fire with the dry dung. As much as the coal went on burning, Panditji remained throwing the coal into the pot to replanish it. That cheat had earlier filled in two massas (weighment of tiniest metal) of gold having made a hole into one piece of the coal escaping the eyes of Panditji. By the excess burning of the coal, the coal containing the gold only remained in the melting pot, then he stopped dropping the coal. The arsenic, sulphur and mercury got vanished and all coals burnt to ashes, only two massas of gold remained solid and that was lying in the melting pot.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Panditji’s joy had no bounds to see the gold. The disguised hermit went away. After his departing Panditji made good stock of arsenic, sulphur and mercury and began to act upon the instruction of immoral disguised hermit, but the gold was not made at all. One day, seeing him infront of his house, Panditji fell down on his feet and bringing him to his residence served him warmly. The disguised hermit asked about his welfare. Panditji said—‘No! You did not hide anything at all, but it is my bad luck that daily I burn arsenic sulphur and mercury but it proves worthless.’ The disguised hermit said—‘Today, before me you, perform all the activities yourself according to instruction; if there is any error, I will guide you.’ When Panditji went inside the house to bring the objects, having made a hole in one of the coals, Babaji put two massas of gold in it. All the materials were already present with Panditji, he brought it at once and put the arsenic, sulphur and mercury mixed with the essence of green leafy vegetable, into the melting pot and put some coal also. As the coal burnt he used to drop another coal into the melting pot. That cheat was watching it sitting aside. When he saw that the coal containing the gold was also assimilated in the melting pot, he said—‘Now, complete one hour has passed, the gold must have been made. Just stand and see and don’t drop the coal now. After a short time all the coals burnt to ashes. The arsenic, sulphur and mercury vanished. Only, two massas of gold remained in the melting pot.’ Panditji was highly delighted to see the gold. He said—‘Respected Sir! I have now understood completely.’ Then, the cheat went away from there. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Panditji daily burnt the arsenic, sulphur and mercury but in vain. Again after five days the same hermit was seen coming on the road infront of his house. Running to him, Panditji fell down on his feet. He asked—‘Now, the domestic affair must be passing on smoothly.’ Panditji said—‘Nothing at all. You told me everything and showed me having got it done by me, also, but it gives no result. God knows why is it so? It is your impact that gold comes out before you; but in your absence, it fails.’ He said—‘I cannot come daily. <br/>Allright, in one single turn, I make so much gold for you that it may be useful for you throughout your life. Bring the entire gold of your house, putting the entire gold in an earthen pot, put it on the fire and fill that earthen pot with water and whatever the arsenic, the sulphur and mercury you have, drop the whole lot into it and paste it with water mixed earth. And put another earthen pot filled with water above it. Go on heating it with fire for eight hours. Then, when you see having opened it, you will get double of the gold.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Panditji performed all the activities as told by him taking the entire ornaments of his wife and putting it in the earthen pot; but there was insufficient water in the earthen pot of the top, so he went inside the house to bring water. In the meantime, Babaji took out all the ornaments from the earthen pot and filled the same into his bag and dropped the pebbles and stones of the same weight into the earthen pot and pasted the mud over it as it was before. In the mean time Panditji came back with water and filled the top earthen pot with water. The earthen pot had curved a bit, so <span class="char-style-override-6">p</span>anditji made it identical having lifted it. While lifting it, the earthen pot had the same weight as it was earlier. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Babaji remained sitting for two or three hours and then he began to say—‘Coming tomorrow exactly at this very time, I will open the mouth of the earthen pot and then, you will get the double gold.’ Having said this, he went away. Panditji remained waiting for Babaji at the appointed time, but Babaji did not turn up through out the day. Really, there was no question of his coming again, he had fled away having got his purpose served. The third day, when Panditji, himself opened the earthen pot, he found the pebbles and stones in it. Panditji felt very much distressed. He related the entire occurances to his family members. All were aggrieved to hear this. They made the search of the hermit to the best of their capacity; but he was not traced out. He was not actually a hermit, he was a very eminent thief to create suspicion even on the true saints and hermits in the society.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the matter of a day, a female cheat in red garments came upon and she made her long stay in a house on rent. She declared herself an accomplished female ascetic in spell and charms. A good number of women began to come to her for the fulfilments of their different desires—such as, some came to get rid of the disease, some to be blessed with a son, some came for the wealth and some came for the marriage-settlement of their sons and daughters. That female asceitc tied the thread of charm and spell to some and to some by enchantment. In this way, she used to give the period of one year to some six months to some and two months to some to get their ambition fulfilled. By such cunningness, she began to cheat the innocent women of their ornaments, clothes and money.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having heard her fame, one day Ramdutta’s wife Bhagavan Devi reached her and began to say—‘Mother! I have no son, so tell me any divice that I may bear a son within the year.’ The so-called female ascetic said— ‘You will be pregnant within a month. In the night of the coming <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>aturday, I will get a magic act to be performed by you. Reach here positively by ten in the night. All the enchantment materials will be available here with me, come here on that night being beautifully dressed up with garments and ornaments in the best possible make up.’ Bhagavan Devi did so. In the <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>aturday night, she came in the best possible make up. The so called female ascetic got her all the garments and ornaments put off and kept it in a seperate room and having locked the room, she handed over the key to Bhagavan Devi. When it was twelve in the night, the cheat female ascetic went on the cross roads with vermillion, oil, an earthen pot and ‘Tikati’ with Bhagavan Devi. Reaching the cross-roads, on the support of the ‘Tikati’ she put the earthen pot and dropped the oil and red lead into it and instructed Bhagavan Devi to mutter a spell told by her for one hour. It is night, the house is void, I am going to watch the house. After one hour come to me with this earthen pot.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The cheat ascetic reached her house and used the duplicate key to open the door of the room and went away with all the ornaments and clothes, kept in the room. When, Bhagavan Devi came back after an hour to her house she found that the so-called ascetic was not there and the room was all open. There was no ornament and clothes in the room. Seeing this, she began to weep. Being ashamed and distressed, she returned her home and narrated the story of her distress to the family members. The family members rebuked her. Then after, they made the search of the so-called ascetic to their best capacity but they could not get her trace at all. Then, they asked the landlord of the house about her address. The landlord said—‘She had already given me the advance of one month rent and to me such wayfarers comes and goes daily. How can I know who that female, so-called ascetic was and where she went away?’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Observing all these occurances, Somdutt’s wife Rama Devi thought—‘All the ornaments of sister, Rohini, the mother-in-law, the wife of husband’s younger brother lost, it is only I whose ornaments are yet safe. After the departure of the youngest daughter-in-law, the income, the business, everything ruined. Now, the family members will meet the domestic expenditures by selling my ornaments only, there appears no other way out.’ Having thought over in this light, she kept her all the ornaments to her paternal house with her younger brother. Her paternal house was in the same city in another locality. Her brother was mischievious, wicked and dishonest. His intention was already malafide from the time before. He sold all the ornaments of Rama Devi and invested it in his business. After some days, he spread the rumour that the thieves took away all the goods having broken the lock in the night. He began to weep just when the morning set in. The people gathered. The police also came. This news spread in the whole city. Then, Rama Devi also came to know about the burglary at her brother’s house. She, at once, rushed up to her brother and said—‘Brother! Whether my ornaments are safe or not?’ Being irritated the brother said—‘It was your ornaments that became the cause of the burglary in my house. Otherwise what was there in my house, which would have attracted the thieves. The thieves took away whatever I possessed including your ornaments.’ Rama Devi again asked—‘Brother! I must get my ornaments by anyway.’ Being annoyed the brother began to say—‘Get out from here. Never show your face again. It is you due to whom I became bankrupt.’ Being distressed she came back and related the entire story to her husband’s family members. They rebuked and reprimanded also but nothing could be possible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then after, all of the family members decided jointly that all the brothers should meet their family expences independently with the earning of his own. As a result, Somdutt and Ramdutt began to live seperately with their own families and the rest family members began to live jointly together.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-7">(7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, when all the family members were sitting together, Pt. Devduttji said simple-heartedly—‘We turned the youngest daughter-in-law out of the house—for a negligible offence, it was our great fault. That is the cause of our distress. She was fortunate, intelligent and a lady of high ideals. If she had been here in this house, such calamities would have never fallen on us. At last, all of them came to conclude that they should go to her but none dared to go on account of being ashamed.’ Anyhow this internal news reached Sushila. Sushila thought—‘My family members want to come to me, but it is not dignified to me. So, I, myself should go to them?’ Thinking so, she, herself, came to her husband’s house the next day and saluted the feet of everyone with reverence, love, meekness and simplicity. All were delighted to see her and felt ashamed of and pained to consider their own immoral act. Sushila said—‘This news came to me that you were thinking to come to me. Knowing this, I, myself came to you, because I am the youngest one. So, it is proper for me to come to you. Sometimes the feelings of your service haunted my mind but on account of being turned out of the house by you, I dared not come here. So, kindly, pardon my fault.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Panditji said—‘Daughter, your fault was of a little importance but we committed blunder.’ Really, Panditji was at all unaware that the daughter-in-law had no fault at all. She was quite innocent, it was infact a conspiracy. The vicious sentiment of the women trembled to think of their sin and distress and the worst condition of the family. It stirred the feeling of repentence instead of jealousy. All of them got inflicted and they came to conclude that the reason of their distress was the torture to the blameless Sushila. The hot tears of their inflicted heart streamed forth from their eyes. The wives of Somdutt and Ramdutt said to their mother-in-law with choking throat in shaking voice with folded hands—‘There was no fault of the youngest daughter-in-law. It is we to be blamed as jealosy overpowered us for entraping her falsely and we reaped the fruits thereof suitably.’ Then, Rohini began to say with broken heart—‘There is no fault of the youngest daughter-in-law at all and the elder brother’s wives are also not to be blamed to a great extent. It is only I, the most wicked to hatch the entire conspiracy and commit this sin. It is I who made a sealed packet of cloth sewen with thread, having packed it with the bangles, necklace of the brother’s wives and my own saree and petticoat and got it sent to the old woman through the hands of the cook and the letter was also written with my hands and had made the false complain to the father. I am the root cause of all this sin. Today, I am feeling burnt with the fire of repentance. If the earth cracks I may inter into it. I have not even courage to beg for pardon from this faultless pure-hearted wife of my elder brother. I don’t deserve even to show my face to her.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing all these true words, Sushila’s heart melted and she stated before all very humbly with folded hands— ‘Please, forget whatever happened in the past. I don’t consider your action any fault at all. Then where is the question of forgiveness?’ Hearing this, her husband Mohan Lal burst into tears and repenting again and again for his doings, began to say—‘I got overwhelmed by deceit. What should be done by me in repentance?’ Sushila said—‘O my husband! Don’t harbour any tension at all. None of you is at fault—really, this is the fruit of my wrong doings of the past. Now, forget everything and consider me your maid servant as before. Whatever the property I have, belongs to you. Get it brought here.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this all of them felt ashamed and began to say—‘How to get your property brought here?’ Sushila said—‘This all belongs to you and I, too, belong to you. All this was done by the God for our good because if God had not done likewise, how this property and the permanent monthly income of one thousand rupees would have been there? Having said this, Sushila surrendered her entire moveable property to the feet of her father-in-law selflessly, having got it brought by her men. Her all the affairs of business remained going on as usual under the supervision of husband’s family members and now, she began to live at her husband’s house. All were charmed to see the holy behaviour of Sushila.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When coming back after playing, Indrasen and Indraseni saw their mother after a long time, they immediately fell down on her feet, the mother embraced them to her bosom. The cook and the servant also were trembling at their serious crime and they were bashfully embrassed. Their bodies were sweating and the hot tears of repentance were there in their eyes. Seeing their silent repentance, Sushila assured and solaced them. Today their lives also changed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Again Sushila said—‘I have heard that the wives of my husband’s elder brothers live separately but I cannot tolerate to let them live separate. They should kindly live jointly as in the past.’ They were charmed to see this behaviour of Sushila. They could not refuse it. Then, all began to live jointly. By the impact of Sushila, all became of virtuous conduct and high character. Whatever slander regarding them had been rumoured, got pacified and their home became an ideal for all the people.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-8">(8)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sushila used to give same treatment to all. Whatever she ate or dressed up herself, she used to provide the same to other family members also. She didn’t differentiate in fooding and clothing. Whatever she fed or clothed to her husband and her own children, she gave the same to her husband’s brothers and their wives as well as to the father-in-law and mother-in-law and her husband’s sister also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> One day, she was giving grape, dried date, almond, pistachio, etc., dry fruits to her son and daughter. In the meanwhile some other children who used to play with her children, happened to come there. Instead of giving it to her own children, Sushila gave it first to these children; and whatever she gave to her children, she gave equally to them; and she gave its better qualtiy to the other children and she gave its inferior quality to her own children. It had a very good impression on her children also. Her son and daughter were very modest. They also gave half of their share to the other chidren even. Why was it not expected from the children of a noble mother, Sushila?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sushila used to attend her husband specially and sometimes when she used to go with her husband to listen to the religious fables or sermons, her son and daughters also accompanied her. Children are by nature playful, but these children were stable-minded; because Sushila was free from fickleness by nature. They used to listen to the sermons very attentively sitting there. Sushila always used to give moral lessons to her children regularly and methodically. She used to say—‘Get up before sun-rise, salute to the elders, never tell a lie, never deceive anybody, never keep anything behind the curtain, never be violent and never commit theft. Always speak the truth, never speak abusive language to anyone, never quarrel to each other, never indulge yourself in beating and hurting and using abusive language with each other, always offer water to the Sun, never eat anything without offering it to the Lord, always, serve others, never eat anything of the market sweet shop; never use the intoxicating things like Bidi or cigarette, tubacco, hemp and hemp smoking; never go to cinema, theatre, club etc; listen to religious fables reverential songs being concentrated, listen to very peacefully in the association of virtuous persons; if you get any thing get it shared with the friends present there while eating; always obey the elders and should always remain dutiful.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If you visit anyone’s residence, there is no question of demanding anything, even when they give you anything, you should not accept it. Well enough! Whatever possible, you should try to serve others, you should never be the deserving of other’s service. How moral lessons are for the children! </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, daily, the preaching of good sermons, religious discourse and chanting of divine names used to be practised regularly in Sushila’s house. It began to have a very good impact on the children and family members and all of them became cultured.</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-9">(9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, Sushila’s father, Pt. Govind Ram conveyed a message through an attendant to her father-in-law to bring her at his home—‘It is my prayer to you—That a long time has passed since Sushila visited my home so kindly, send her to my home along with her children.’ On the call of her father Sushila also requested humbly—‘A long time of meeting with my parents passed, so, if you permit, I should go to my parental house and she may get together with them and if you permit, I should stay there for a few days.’ The father-in-law and the mother-in-law said happily—‘You may go; but you will not take a long time to stay there because how will we pass our days without you?’ Thus, saying in this way, they sent her to her paternal house with a reliable person.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching there with her children, Sushila saluted the feet of her mother and father. The parents asked—‘Are your family members happy there?’ Sushila said—‘By the God’s grace all are quite well, but here, I don’t see my brother, Ramlal and his wife, what is the matter?’ Pt. Govind Ramji said—‘He has been living in a rented house for a number of days, seperate from us. He spends all his earning in eating-drinking and on entertaining his friends. Now, we have grown old, we have no energy to earn, I meet the domestic expenses with the money what I get by selling old property.’ Sushila said—‘Did the brother separated himself on the advice of his wife or is there any other reason?’ The mother said—‘No, daughter! She belongs to a very good family. If I say to her, even against her will, she is not annoyed. She is of very modest nature, she does not know how to quarrel. She ignores it by smiling even if anybody relates to her absurdly. Even  now, she tries to persuade Ramlal from time to time taking my favour. I usually weep to remember her nature, her services and her separation. Ram lal, too was of good nature, but due to the influence of insolent boys, he separated himself from us.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sushila said—‘Mother! What is your opinion if I bring the brother and his wife here by persuation?’ The mother said—‘I will be lucky, daughter! If it is so.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The brother, Ramlal lived at a distance in another locality of Prayag, the same city. Sushila with her children went to Ram Lal’s residence with a member of the family. Ramlal was not there in the house, his wife was sitting, seeing Sushila coming, she stood up and received her with due respect and love. Sushila also saluted her feet along with her children. When her brother’s wife began to hesitate a bit, Sushila said—‘Respected Sister! Because of being elder, you are like my mother, what is hesitation here? It is the duty of youngers to salute the elders feet.’ Being ashamed, her brother’s wife said—‘Sister! You have come to your mother, it had been brought to my knowledge, but it is punching me that I could not go there due to your brother’s fear.’ Sushila said—‘You should not mind it at all. The mother has high praise for you by remembering your nature and your services and she weeps due to your separation.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the meantime, her brother Ramlal too, came. At once, Sushila stood with her children and saluted  his feet. Ramlal also gave due respect and love to Sushila. After the formal querry of welfare, Sushila said—‘Brother! I am feeling very much sad today to see you separate from the mother and father.’ Ramlal said—‘Sister! I had already got the news of your coming. I had a keen desire to meet you but I felt that the father and mother might insult me if I went there and I didn’t call you here to think that perhaps they would not allow you to come here.’ Sushila said—‘Brother! You are not at fault at all, it is my fault that it was yesterday when I could not meet you. But brother! When I had gone to my husband’s house, both of you used to obey and serve the mother and father very sincerely. When I remember your virtues of that time, I feel amazed how did you start living separate from them? You used to give me lessons finding my flaws, still I remember your those words.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ramlal said—‘Sister! Hearing your words I feel  ashamed of. The reason of my separation was that my friends who used to come to me, were disliked by my mother and father. Seeing this my friends began to take it ill and they advised me to live separate, leaving everything with mother and father and it would not be reproachable. You are learned, able; you should earn yourself for your living. Why should you depend on the income and property of your parents? Influenced by their words, I got myself separated from my father and mother. ‘Sister! You are wise, you prove worth of your name by your virtues so advise me what I should do.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, Sushila said in a very affectionate, polite and sweet voice—‘Brother! Should I advise you? Whatever the merits appear in me are the impact of your teachings. If I say something, that must be certainly taught by you. When I was an immatured child, you used to give me the lesson that a man cannot pay off the debt of mother and father even after serving them hundreds of years. To serve the father and mother is a great moral duty and the rest secondary duty.* Today I am very much surprised to see you separate from mother and father and whatever the father-mother would have said about your friends, that must have been in your interest. What is the meaning of such friends who detach from mother and father? If your friends had been sensible and wise, why would have they made you deprived of the service of mother and father, which is the means of deliverance? You ought to have thought of that whether they wanted to serve their own purpose by doing so or they were doing it in your interest. Brother! The mother and father usually weep to remember your virtues and services in your separation. There is repute of your virtues and conduct in the world and you have a good impression in the heart of the most of noble and good persons. How will you bear the insult and reproach made by them, when they will form a very bad opinion about you, leaving a very bad impression on them if you live separate from your mother and father? Why should be created the sentiment of hatred in your mind from the paternal property? How can we be detached from our parents? Whatever lies in our body, that belongs to them. This is my opinion that surrendering to their feet, pardon should be begged; it is not proper to make delay in it. The fault of the elders should never be taken into consideration at all even if they are at fault.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">In the meanwhile the brother’s wife happened to speak—‘Venerable sister! In the separation of father-in-law and mother-in-law neither I am happy nor I feel at home. At times I pray to him also. But I don’t know why has God deprived me of their service?’ Ramlal said—‘Sister! I feel shy to go there uncalled and without seeking their permission. I am afraid that they might insult me.’ Sushila said—‘Brother! There is no question of their consent. They are already eager. They weep in your separation, what is the shame in going to them? In my opinion, they will be happy to receive you. And what is the matter of insult in going to the father and mother?Disrespect rendered by them is more valuable than their respect.’*</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">*	Any poet has said—</p>

<p class="Footnotes-English">‘When a person is humiliated by the harsh words of Guru (Preceptor) he gets repute only then, otherwise not. Just as unless the gem of superior quality is whitened by rubbing it well, it is not imputed in the crown of the kings.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the above benevolent words of Sushila, Ramlal and his wife, both came to the parental house with Sushila and the both began to weep falling on parents feet repenting for their flaws.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mother-father said—‘Son! It is a matter of good luck for me, today, it is a lucky day for me.’ Then, they said to Sushila— ‘Daughter, Sushila! I will never forget throughout the life the outstanding work done by you today.’ Sushila said—‘Mother! What is your opinion? Its entire credit goes to you, father, brother and his wife. I am only the instrumental cause. Whatever the goodness you find in me that also is the grace of all of you only.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All were charmed to see such a behaviour free from the egotism of Sushila. Sushila had two charming spells. These two spells were—1. To make selfless efforts in the interest of the concerned having given up own interest, with these spells she made agreeable to her point of view, 2. Avoiding his demerits, to praise of his merits highly. Only by these distinctive characteristics, she changed her brother’s heart. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After then, Ramlal made prayer to his friends very humbly—‘I can meet you at your residence while I am free, I am helpless to give you due welcome at my paternal house.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sushila stayed at her paternal house for a few days but she never made any complaint against the torture or ill-behaviour, given to her at her husband’s house. The father, mother, brother and his wife offered her different types of items and objects for her fooding and clothing, but she did not accept it inspite of their insistence. If she used to take a little something only for their satisfaction, that also with the feeling of detachment, she was not the least fond of it. Her behaviour was of much sacrificing and praiseworthy. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, on the persistent call of her husband’s house, persuading her mother humbly and expressing the sorrow of separation, Sushila went away to her husband’s house with a reliable person. Seeing Sushila at their residence, all the men and women of her husband’s house were highly delighted. </p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-10">(10)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the next side, seeing twelve years old Sushila’s daughter, Indraseni, worth marrying, her father-in-law and mother-in-law used to remain very much worried for her marriage. So, one day, they said to their youngest daughter-in-law—‘Now, Indraseni has grown up to the marriagable age. Due to your good impression, on others, many are interested for relation with us. Whom do you consider suitable for engagement?’ Sushila said to her mother-in-law—‘What is the need of my opinion here? All of us should be happy with your decision of engagement with the person whom you consider suitable. I have heard it from the mouths of all of you that the engagement of a girl should be settled with a boy having good health vitality, knowledge, talent, wisdon, ability, conduct, good nature and high character etc., in spite of his belonging to a poor family even. His family members and particularly his mother’s and father’s nature and conduct should be cordial.’ Hearing this, all were very much pleased.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In accordance with the destiny of Indraseni and on account of Sushila’s repute, it was all by chance that the house and suitable suitor for Indraseni was got available without any effort according to Sushila’s longings. Indraseni’s engagement was settled with Pandit Damodar Shastri’s son, Shiv <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>umar. Pandit Damodarji had a feeling of respect for Sushila, so he sent his wife to Sushila for consultation with her about the marriage. Just on her reaching at her residence, Sushila received them warmly with due respect. Then, Damodar Das’s wife said—‘Having made relation with you, this marriage should be an ideal one. There is no question of extravagancy and bad customs in your house, we also want to act upon your advice for our betterment.’ Thus, on insistence and earnest respectful querry Sushila said—‘The money should not be wasted on crackers, outer show, cinema, theatre, excessive lightning, bands etc. In the marriage function there should not be the use of joking abusive language, to sing dirty songs, to play playing cards, to play on the different types of bands etc., should be avoided. The marriage should be ceremonised with Vedic rites by the well learned Brahmans, there should not be a big crowd of the people in the marriage party. Now, kindly, tell me what should be done from my side.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Pandit Damodardas’s wife said—‘What should we instruct you? We want to act upon your advice. We are eager to listen to your thinking about it. If you think it proper, kindly, tell us.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, Sushila said—‘Fun and joke, dance and filthy songs are already restrained here. Hemp, tobacco, hemp-smoke, etc., intoxicated objects, ice-soda, to give lemonade, to arrange the dinner in the hotels, to give party and use scent etc., in the reception are already against Shastras and at the same time it is an insult to them in the name of welcome on reception. According to the rules of Shastras, after the besmearing of turmeric ceremony etc., having got the gods worshipped in the ordained way, there is the provision of the girl’s donation (<span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>anyadan) according to the consent of reputed preceptors. Your real reception lies in the good behaviour with due honour and love; we really lack there, the arrangement of dinner and betel, betel nut, clove, cardamom has been done generally in the usual way. What is there with me to give you as dowry? Really, we want to make us pious by offering you an innocent girl in your service. It is our great luck to get a relation with such sacrificing and simple men like you. All of us are charmed with your behaviour.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After this, in due course at the appointed time, an ideal and praiseworthy marriage ceremony was performed in the atmosphere of mutual love, and cordial behaviour according to the rules of Shastras and after mutual respectful salutation, the marriage party was sent off. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Somdutt, Ramdutt and Mohanlal used to run the business started by Sushila, themselves and they had a very good mutual loving relation. The behaviour of the other women of the family had also improved beyond expectation on account of Sushila’s contact. Thus, after sometime passed, when Sushila’s son, Indrasen became sixteen years old, his marriage with Pt. Raghunath Acharya’s daughter Gayatri, was also performed. That marriage was also ceremonised in a very simple, and ideal way as it had been done in the past. It was the most praiseworthy. In his marriage also, there was no question of dance, filthy song, evil practices and extravagancy and there was the sacrificial behaviour from this side. But on the more insistence and earnest request of Raghunath Acharya they had to accept the nominal dowry for his satisfaction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, after the marriage of the both—the son and the daughter, all the family members began to live happily in their house being fully contented and carefree and their mutual relation was very cordial and sacrificing.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-11">(11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After some days, Pandit Devduttji caught fever because of the bodily weakness due to the breathing problem. Various Ayurvedic medicines were served but none was effective. Being charmed with the humble and loving service of Sushila day and night, Devduttji said—‘Daughter! You were quite blameless and innocent, and I had got you turned out of the house, that pain pricks my heart like thorn.’ Sushila said through her husband’s sister, Rukmini—‘Reverent father-in-law! You are not at fault at all. All that happened due to deception. You should not think of it at all. I consider it my ill-luck that I remained separate from you for a long time. Now, considering yourself responsible for it if you feel agonised, it will have a reverse effect on my heart.’ Hearing this Panditji said—‘Daughter! Don’t take it seriously. Hearing your words there remained no such feeling in my heart.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After that Panditji’s condition went on deteriorating. Seeing, this, the family members cleaned the place by sweeping it and then, washing it with holy water, they paved it with cow-dung and made a square with dung and Gangajal (ganges water) and spreading sesame seed and mustard seed on it, wrote the name of the Lord. Making a holy bed-stead of sand, on it they sprinkled the Ganga water and having written ‘Ram’ on it they purified it with ganges water by reciting mantras. Having spread the holy ‘kusa’ on the sand, they stretched the holy hand-made white cloth. Then, after getting the hint of Panditji, Somdutt bathed him with holy water and made him put on new holy upper and lower garment and changed his sacred thread and then after, they laid him on that bed-stead of sand and covered his body with a new, holy, white hand-made cloth covering sheet. They put a new earthen pot of basil. They made his neck wear a garland of tulasi beads and put the Tilak with sandal paste on his forehead. They put a light and a small book of the Gita below his head. Panditji was the devotee of the Lord Vishnu, so they put a small idol of Shaligaramji on his chest. Then, with leaf-flower, incense stick and illuminating earthen lamp the Lord was worshipped in sixteen ways and the light was waved. Then after, having made him drink the Gangajal (The Ganges water) and tulsi leaf (basil), Somdutt related the eighth chapter of the Gita with its meaning in Hindi to Panditji. Then after, all collectively began to sing the Lord’s name with great devotion in the single tone and single melody. A beautiful portrait of Lord Vishnu was lying hung on the wall infront of Panditji. Just seeing that portrait remembering the name, form, merits, virtues and the power of the Lord and hearing the reverential sing of Lord’s name, Panditji passed away to the Supreme Lord’s abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Specially, the sisters and mothers should learn a lesson from this story that they should emulate the virtues of Sushila, considering her their ideal. It means that they should behave friendly, humbly and politely with even those who are hostile and always think ill of us. They should be benevolent even to the evil doers to themselves. The children should be served affectionately, the persons of same age group should be served friendly and the elders should be served with devotion, pious feeling and humbly. They should always make effort to stick to the truth by doing the selfless ideal deeds being free from name and fame to give its credit to others only. One should never think of committing suicide knowingly and giving up of patience, morality, righteous duty, devotion to God; being coerced by sensuousness anger, greed, shame, fear etc., even if the formidable misery befall. Considering as their duty, they should serve the father-in-law, the mother-in-law, mother and father and husband etc., elders selflessly, humbly and lovingly with body, mind and money. They should impart a moral lesson to the children by their moral conduct and speech. They should give up all extravagancy and evil customs in the marriage ceremonies of their sons and daughters. They should apply foresightedness, wisdom, and skill to escape from thieves, wickeds, cheaters, mean fellows and deceits. They should offer selfless service to a person stricken by disease, death and calamity. They should make due prompt effort for the progress of knowledge, wisdom, vitality, grace, lustre and skill knowledge. They should try to appreciate their true merits and propogate it instead of giving mind to their demerits to make everyone favourable and always try to do anything in their interest. They should adopt the qualities of forgiveness, kindness, peace, equality, smoothness, contentment, simplicity, devotion, love etc., in their practical lives and they should shape their conduct and character attending the association of virtuous persons, listening to the religious fables and reverential Kirtan, going to the places of pilgrimage, serving others, performing austerity giving charity and thus, they should adopt selflessly all the above mentioned merits like nectar.</p>
