Vrishchika had been seeing several kids of patients affected by the
chemical leak that had happened sometime ago. While she saw some purely
for routine clinical practice, she was also particularly interested in
the several cases exhibiting heterotaxy and had amassed a collection of
such. With Indrasena she had identified a collection of mutations in
these patients and those from elsewhere. Eventually, with Lootika and
Somakhya they had translated it into some interesting and ancient
biochemistry concerning membrane protein stability that was widespread
in eukaryotes. Now they were sitting down at Somakhya and Lootika’s
house to work on a manuscript on this matter. As they did so, they asked
their sons to get some lessons from Jhilleeka.

To get her nephews started Jhilleeka asked them: “So what did you two
learn from Tigmanika’s grandfather little ones?”  
Guhasena: “He taught us something very important which the very basis of
the apprehension of the space of our everyday life: the
gardabha-nyāya.”  
J: “Could you tell me what that is?”  
Tigmanika: “He said that even though in the early days when our
ancestors roamed on the steppes they saw the braying ass as something
alien and evil, they came around to see it as an animal that should be
respected. He felt that was because it taught us the gardabha-nyāya:
gardabho ‘pi tryaśre hrasiṣṭam patham ādhatte |”  
Guhasena: “It is the Donkey’s theorem: No side a triangle is greater
than the sum of the other two.”  
J: “What more did his tell you about this?”  
G: “He also taught us the area of a triangle and the
bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya.”

J: “So, nephews, what is the sūtra for the area of a triangle given its
three sides?”  
T: “bhujayogārdhasya bhūjayogārdha-pratyeka-bhujona-ghātāt padam phalam
iti |”  
J: “That formula is known from at least the work of the old scientist
Brahmagupta who had a mix of good and bad ideas. Guha write it down on
the board.”

G: ![A =
\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a+c-b)(b+c-a)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A+%3D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5Csqrt%7B%28a%2Bb%2Bc%29%28a%2Bb-c%29%28a%2Bc-b%29%28b%2Bc-a%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A = \\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a+c-b)(b+c-a)}")

J: “Boys do you realize from that is self-evident from this that if a
triangle exists the Donkey’s theorem must be true?”  
T and G: “Yes\! If any side of a triangle were greater than the sum of
the other two then by this formula the triangle cannot have an area
because what is under the square root will be negative. So the existence
of a triangle predicates the gardadbha-nyāya.”

J: “That is good. Knowing your grandfather, I am sure he gave you some
problems — he used to entertain me with such whenever we met. Were you
able to solve them?”  
T: “Yes, he gave us three. We solved one of them easily and we believe
we solved the second one but mom said our solution was not good enough
and that our grandfather might call us idiots if we show it to him.”  
J: “OK. What were they?”

G: “The first goes thus: Let ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a, b, c") be the 3 sides of a triangle from shortest to longest side.
In what interval will the ratio of the sum of the short and long side to
the middle side fall? We solved it thus: At one extreme will be a
degenerate triangle whose sides will be ![a=0, b=1,
c=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D0%2C+b%3D1%2C+c%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=0, b=1, c=1"). At the other extreme we have another degenerate
triangle with sides ![a=1, b=1,
c=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%2C+b%3D1%2C+c%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1, b=1, c=2"). If we reduce the triangles, all others will have sides
in between these. Hence, ![1 \\le \\tfrac{a+c}{b} \\le
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Cle+%5Ctfrac%7Ba%2Bc%7D%7Bb%7D+%5Cle+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1 \\le \\tfrac{a+c}{b} \\le 3").”

J: “Not bad. That’s indeed the case. It is not for nothing our
intellectual predecessors would say: ‘trai-rāśikenaiva yad etad uktaṃ
vyāptaṃ sva-bhedair hariṇeva viśvam |‘ All that has been stated is
permeated by the principle of proportions even as Viṣṇu pervades all
with his own \[manifold\] forms. Those forms of Viṣṇu are the 1000s
which exist in the different adhvan-s as laid out in the teachings of
the Vaiṣṇava mode of tāntrikopāsana. Alright, so what was the next
problem whose solution was found wanting by Lootika?”

T: “Let ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a, b, c") be the 3 sides of a triangle from shortest to longest side.
What will be the interval in which the maximal proportion of the short
to the middle side or middle to the long side fall?”  
J: “So, what did you do?”  
T: “One can see that when we have and equilateral triangle or degenerate
triangles such that ![a=0, b=1,
c=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D0%2C+b%3D1%2C+c%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=0, b=1, c=1"), or ![a=1, b=1,
c=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1%2C+b%3D1%2C+c%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1, b=1, c=2") then ![\\tfrac{a}{b}=1;
\\tfrac{b}{c}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D1%3B+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}=1; \\tfrac{b}{c}=1") or ![\\tfrac{a}{b}=0;
\\tfrac{b}{c}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D0%3B+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}=0; \\tfrac{b}{c}=1") or ![\\tfrac{a}{b}=1;
\\tfrac{b}{c}=\\tfrac{1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D1%3B+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}=1; \\tfrac{b}{c}=\\tfrac{1}{2}"); So,
![\\max\\left(\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{b}{c}\\right) \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmax%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\max\\left(\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{b}{c}\\right) \\le 1"). Thus, we
have one end of the interval but the other end of the interval needed
some experiments to determine.”  
G: “We can see that it should be a degenerate triangle such that from
![\\tfrac{a}{b},
\\tfrac{1-\\tfrac{a}{b}}{1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7B1-%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%7D%7B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{1-\\tfrac{a}{b}}{1}") we should get the maximum.
By writing out different proportions for degenerate triangles we
realized it is some number close to 0.618.”  
J: “That’s not bad nephews. You are close to the answer. What you have
to do is to get the actual number with some formal algebra. You were
right in reasoning that it should be a degenerate triangle where
![a+b=c=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Bb%3Dc%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a+b=c=1"). If
![\\tfrac{a}{b}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}") were to decrease from 1 such that it remains greater
than ![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b") then you come closer and closer to the lower bound of your desired
interval. But if you cross that bound then
![b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "b")
becomes greater than
![\\tfrac{a}{b}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}"). So your bound will be where the two are equal. Thus,
you can write: ![\\tfrac{a}{b}= b;
a=b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%3D+b%3B+a%3Db%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{a}{b}= b; a=b^2"). But since it is a degenerate triangle
![a=1-b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1-b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1-b"); by plugging that we get the quadratic equation
![b^2+b-1=0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%5E2%2Bb-1%3D0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b^2+b-1=0"). Now, I have taught you how to solve those; so write the
answer on the board”  
G and T:
![b=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%3D%5Ctfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B5%7D-1%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b=\\tfrac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}")  
J: “As you can see that number is close to what your experiment yielded.
It is known as
![\\phi'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi'") or the conjugate Golden Ratio. Thus, as a consequence of the
gardabha-nyāya the maximal proportion of the successive sides of a
triangle always lies in the interval ![\\phi' \\le
\\max\\left(\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{b}{c}\\right) \\le
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%27+%5Cle+%5Cmax%5Cleft%28%5Ctfrac%7Ba%7D%7Bb%7D%2C+%5Ctfrac%7Bb%7D%7Bc%7D%5Cright%29+%5Cle+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi' \\le \\max\\left(\\tfrac{a}{b}, \\tfrac{b}{c}\\right) \\le 1").
The more advance in age the more you will realized of the ubiquity of
the former bound like Indra pervading existence. Let us move on; how did
you fare with the 3rd problem?”

G and T: “Given an angle
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta"), construct a triangle such that its sides ![a, b,
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b%2C+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a, b, c") will be in an arithmetic progression. We have been able to
obtain a few cases like ![1, 1,
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2C+1%2C+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1, 1, 1") or ![3, 4,
5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%2C+4%2C+5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3, 4, 5") but we have been breaking our head over how to solve it
generally?”  
J: “Fine. First I’ll give you the construction and then explain the
rationale. Do this construction on your tablets as I tell you:

Now check out a few examples of such triangles with this construction
and verify if we are getting what we want.”

G and T: “Aunt, that is almost like magic: how did you know this would
work?”  
J: “It is simple. You have to first bring to mind an important
generalization of the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya known as the koṭijyā-nyāya
which applies to any triangle:

![c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos(C)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%3Da%5E2%2Bb%5E2-2ab%5Ccos%28C%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\\cos(C)")

Kids, you can see that if the sides are in arithmetic progression we can
write them as ![a=x-k, b=x;
c=x+k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3Dx-k%2C+b%3Dx%3B+c%3Dx%2Bk&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=x-k, b=x; c=x+k"). Moreover, constant of the progression
![k=b-a=c-b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3Db-a%3Dc-b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=b-a=c-b"). Now we apply the koṭijyā-nyāya for such a triangle:  
![c^2+b^2-2bc\\cos(A)=a^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%2Bb%5E2-2bc%5Ccos%28A%29%3Da%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

"x^2+2kx+k^2+x^2-2x(x+k)\\cos(A)=x^2-2kx+k^2")  
![2k+x-2(x+k)\\cos(A)=-2k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2k%2Bx-2%28x%2Bk%29%5Ccos%28A%29%3D-2k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2k+x-2(x+k)\\cos(A)=-2k")  
![4k+x=2(x+k)\\cos(A)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4k%2Bx%3D2%28x%2Bk%29%5Ccos%28A%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

"\\cos(A)=2-\\tfrac{3b}{2c}")

That is the formula which we have expressed in the construction I just
gave you. When we are done you can figure that out and how the
koṭijyā-nyāya implies the gardabha-nyāya.”

Jhilleeka next decided to use the gardabha-nyāya to introduce her
nephews to a fundamental understanding of the conics. J: “I’m sure
Tigma’s grandfather has introduced you to the conics, the ellipse, the
parabola and the hyperbola those most important curves a person ought
have a proper understanding of. Such was a signal sent to the
yavanācārya-s by their god Apollo, who is a cognate of our Rudra.”  
T and G: “Yes we have learned to draw them and have even taught our
sister Prithika who seems to have taken a fancy for drawing ellipses.”  
J: “That is indeed an auspicious sign. Now, if I tell you that the
existence of conics are a natural consequence of the truth of the
gardabha-nyāya (triangle inequality), then would it surprise you two?”  
T and G: “That sounds very interesting. Could you please tell us more.”

J: “OK. Now consider the following problem: Given 2 points
![F\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1") and

construction and to think about this deeply by yourself for sometime
after I’m done.”

\\overline{F'\_1F\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P%7D+%5Cge+%5Coverline%7BF%27_1F_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F'_1P}+\\overline{F_2P} \\ge \\overline{F'_1F_2}")  
3\) Hence, as
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
moves along
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l") we
will get
![\\min(\\overline{F'\_1P}+\\overline{F\_2P})](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%28%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P%7D%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\min(\\overline{F'_1P}+\\overline{F_2P})") only then the triangle
become degenerate, i.e. point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
lies on the segment
![F'\_1F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'_1F_2"). We can call that version of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
point
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0"). Thus, we get
![\\min(\\overline{F'\_1P}+\\overline{F\_2P})=\\overline{F'\_1P\_0}+\\overline{F\_2P\_0}=\\overline{F\_1P\_0}+\\overline{F\_2P\_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmin%28%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P%7D%29%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P_0%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF_1P_0%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\min(\\overline{F'_1P}+\\overline{F_2P})=\\overline{F'_1P_0}+\\overline{F_2P_0}=\\overline{F_1P_0}+\\overline{F_2P_0}")

You can see that for any given line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l")
there will be only one such point
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") with respect to the points ![F\_1,
F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1, F_2") and the sum
![\\overline{F\_1P\_0}+\\overline{F\_2P\_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P_0%7D%2B%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F_1P_0}+\\overline{F_2P_0}") will be some constant
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k"),
which will have to be greater than the distance between ![F\_1,
F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1, F_2"). Now, there will be other lines like
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l") on
which a
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") will yield the same constant with respect its distances from
![F\_1,
F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1, F_2"). So what will the total set of such points amount to?”

T: “Since we define an ellipse as the curve on which every point has the
same sum of distances from its 2 foci, these
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") should define an ellipse. Now I see how the mere existence of an
ocean of lines and points in the fabric of space automatically specify
ellipses\!”  
J: “Good. So what will that collection of lines be?”  
G: “These should all be tangents to the ellipse since only one point on
the line
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") also lies on the ellipse.”  
J: “Good. Also observe in the figure I’ve drawn that the angle made by
![\\overline{F\_1P\_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F_1P_0}") and
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l") on
one side is congruent to the angle made by
![\\overline{F\_2P\_0}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_2P_0%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F_2P_0}") and
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l") on
the other side. As you would have learned the angles are congruent in
this way when you reflect a light ray of a mirror. Thus, you can see
that if you make a mirror with the curvature of an ellipse and place a
light source at one focus then the rays will be reflected and converge
at the other focus.

Now the two of you work out a similar case when the points
![F\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1") and
![F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_2") are on opposite side of the line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l").
However, in this case we instead seek when the difference of the
distances of a point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") on
line ![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l") from
![F\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1") and
![F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_2") reaches a maximum rather than a minimum”

T: “We learned of another way writing of the Donkey’s theorem: as ![a+b
\\ge
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Bb+%5Cge+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a+b \\ge c") we have ![a \\ge
c-b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cge+c-b&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a \\ge c-b"). If ![b \\ge
c](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b+%5Cge+c&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"b \\ge c") we write the absolute value; thus, ![a

"a \\ge|c-b|"). If the absolute value of the difference were to be
bigger than
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") it
would violate the Donkey’s theorem. Therefore, ![a \\ge
|c-b|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cge+%7Cc-b%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a \\ge |c-b|") and this is the form of the theorem we have to use to
find the solution.”  
G: “I can intuitively feel that we are headed to a hyperbola.”  
J: “That’s right but now work it out fully.”

The two worked it out with their aunt helping and after sometime
obtained the following solution on their tablets (Figure 5):  
1\) Reflect Point
![F\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1") on line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l") to
get
![F'\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'_1")  
2\) Due to the reflection,
![\\overline{F\_1P}=\\overline{F'\_1P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF_1P%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27_1P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F_1P}=\\overline{F'_1P}"). Further, since ![F\_1,
F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1, F_2") are fixed
![F'\_1F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'_1F_2") is of fixed length.  
3\) Apply the Donkey’s theorem to
![\\triangle{F'\_1PF\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27_1PF_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle{F'_1PF_2}"): ![\\overline{F'\_1F\_2} \\ge
|F'\_1P-F\_2P|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF%27_1F_2%7D+%5Cge+%7CF%27_1P-F_2P%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F'_1F_2} \\ge |F'_1P-F_2P|").  
4\) The difference
![|F'\_1P-F\_2P|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CF%27_1P-F_2P%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"|F'_1P-F_2P|") being less than the distance between
![F'\_1,F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27_1%2CF_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'_1,F_2") will attain a maximum only when
![\\triangle{F'\_1PF\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27_1PF_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle{F'_1PF_2}") becomes degenerate and ![P, F'\_1,
F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%2C+F%27_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P, F'_1, F_2") lie on the same line — let us call this unique
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") as
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") and here ![\\overline{F'\_1F\_2} =
|F'\_1P\_0-F\_2P\_0|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BF%27_1F_2%7D+%3D+%7CF%27_1P_0-F_2P_0%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{F'_1F_2} = |F'_1P_0-F_2P_0|")  
5\) By definition a hyperbola is the curve such that points on it have a
constant difference of their distances from the 2 focii. Thus, all
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") that will yield a certain constant difference
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k") of
their distances from ![F\_1,
F\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_1%2C+F_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F_1, F_2") will define a hyperbola and the corresponding lines will be
tangents of that hyperbola.

Jhilleeka remarked: “Here too you will notice that, as in the ellipse,
the line
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l")
bisects the
![\\angle{F\_1P\_0F\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle%7BF_1P_0F_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle{F_1P_0F_2}").”  
G: “But aunt Jhilli what about the parabola?”  
J: “That is a good question. You may know this thing about the conics:
There are many flavors of ellipses and hyperbolas but ultimately all
parabolas and circles are the same. Imagine an ellipse and a hyperbola
with a common fixed focus and passing through a fixed point. Let the
second focus of each of them move in opposite directions towards
infinity. When the two foci of the ellipse coincide we get a circle. As
the second focus moves towards infinity the ellipse converges to a
parabola from within. As the second focus of the hyperbola moves to
infinity it converges to the parabola from without. Thus, the parabola
is a limit for both the ellipse and the hyperbola and is unique. Because
of it emerging from one of the foci going to infinity it is endlessly
open on one side and has only one axis of symmetry unlike the other two.
Hence, we need to take a slightly more complicated approach to
understand its emergence from the Donkey’s theorem. Let me show you
that.”

J: “For this we have to consider the following setup: Let there be two
lines ![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l") and
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") and a fixed point
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "F").
For a point
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") on
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l"),
when will the signed difference of the distances of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") and to
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "F")
reach a maximum? To work this out do this construction:

1\) Reflect point
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "F") in
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l") to
get ![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'"). Hence,
![\\overline{FP}=\\overline{F'P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BFP%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{FP}=\\overline{F'P}").  
2\) From ![F,
F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%2C+F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F, F'") choose that point which is closer to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'"). In our case (Figure 6) it is
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'"). Since
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "F") is
fixed so is
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'") and the distance of
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'") to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") is a positive constant
![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "k").  
3\) From the construction we can see that the distance of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
from
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") will be
![k+y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%2By&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k+y") when
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") is
above point
![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "C"),
i.e. the point of intersection of
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l")
and ![d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"d"), a line parallel to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") through
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'"). When
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") is
below ![C](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"C") then its distance from
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") will be
![k-y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k-y&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k-y").  
4\) Thus, the signed difference between the distances of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") and
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'") (or
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "F"))
will be ![k \\pm y-
\\overline{F'P}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cpm+y-+%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k \\pm y- \\overline{F'P}").  
5\) We see that
![\\triangle{F'BP}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle%7BF%27BP%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle{F'BP}") is a right triangle. A specific consequence of the
Donkey’s theorem for such a triangle is that the karṇa (hypotenuse) will
always be longer than the two legs. Hence, ![k \\pm y -\\overline{F'P}
\<
k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cpm+y+-%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D+%3C+k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k \\pm y -\\overline{F'P} \< k") unless

"+y=\\overline{F'P}"). In this instance, ![k + y -\\overline{F'P} =
k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%2B+y+-%5Coverline%7BF%27P%7D+%3D+k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k + y -\\overline{F'P} = k") and it will be the maximum signed value
that it can ever attain. This will happen only when
![F'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"F'") lies on the perpendicular dropped from
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") to
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'"). We can call this special
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P") as
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0").

You can see that the collection of all such
![P\_0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"P_0") on lines
![l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "l")
defined by the maximal signed difference of the distances of
![P](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "P")
from
![l'](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=l%27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"l'") and
![F](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "F")
being ![k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k") will amount to a parabola. The parabola as you all know is defined
as curve such that every point on it shows the same distance from the
focus and a fixed line. You can see that the fixed line is
![d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "d")
the directrix of the parabola.”

T and G: “It is amazing that the conics are a natural consequence of

graha-gaṇitaṃ vyāptam |). Bhāskara-II expanding on what he mentioned
regarding the deva Viṣṇu states further that:

yathā bhagavatā śrī-nārāyaṇena janana-maraṇa-kleśa-apahāriṇā
nikhila-jagat-janana+eka-bījena sakala-bhuvana-bhāvanena
giri-sarit-sura-nara-asura+ādibhiḥ sva-bhedair idaṃ jagat vyāptaṃ tathā
+idam akhilam gaṇita-jātam trairāśikena vyāptam ||

Just as the lord Śrī-nārāyaṇa, who takes away the afflictions of birth
and death, who is the one seed that gave rise to the entire universe,
causing the manifestation of all the worlds by pervading this universe
within his own forms as mountains, rivers, gods, men, demons and the
like so also all these branches of mathematics are pervaded by the
trairāśika (i.e. the principle of proportions).

You may wonder why so much ado over something as simple as the principle
of proportions and its exaltation by comparison to Viṣṇu’s universal
manifestation taught by the pāñcarātrika-s. Nephews, I’d say that it is
not mere hyperbole nor a peculiar analogy but an intertwined metaphor of
how the origin of the universe from the root cause termed Śrī-Nārāyaṇa
according to the pāñcarātrika-s, i.e. the conjugate of Lakṣmī and Viṣṇu
is an expression of elementary mathematical principles. The principle of
proportions governs the measurement of space and existence of scale that
is the basic foundation of this universe. Likewise, the simple
gardabha-nyāya we have dwelt upon is a pervasive principle linked to the
generalization of the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya that “selects” for
particular genera of curves in space on which the foundations of physics
rest. ity alaṃ vistareṇa |”
