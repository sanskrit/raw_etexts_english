The holy city of Mathura is one of the great sthala-s for the member of
the kumAra shAsana. Above are a sampling of images of what survives of
the early kaumAra iconography after the several Mohammedan assaults on
the city. They are mostly from the shu\~Nga, though some could be from
the kushAna period.
