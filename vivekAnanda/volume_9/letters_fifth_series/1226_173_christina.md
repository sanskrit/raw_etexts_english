## CLXXIII

*To Sister Christine*

VEDANTA SOCIETY,  
102 EAST 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,

*15th June 1900*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am getting better every day, only this New York is a bad place for
sleep. Again, I am working some, though not hard, to get the old friends
together and put the thing in shape.

Now, you know, I will in a week or so finish this work and then be ready
for a real quiet of a week or two or more.

Detroit, alas! will be no better than New York. With so many old
friends! How can you avoid friends whom you really love?

I will have perfect freedom at yours — sure — but how can I avoid seeing
friends and the eternal visiting and paying visits and much
talkee-talkee? Do you know any other place within eight or ten hours (I
want to avoid night rides) of riding from New York where I can be quiet
and free from the people? (Lord bless them.) I am dead tired seeing
people just now. Just think of that and everything else; if, after all,
you think Detroit is the best place for me, I am ready to come.

Yours truly,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS — I am also thinking of a quiet place.

V.
