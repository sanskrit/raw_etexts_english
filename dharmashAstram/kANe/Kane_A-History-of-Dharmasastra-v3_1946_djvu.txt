HISTORY OF DHARIASASTRA 

( ANCIENT AND MEDIAEVAL 
RELIGIOUS AND CIVIL LAW ) 



By 
the late Dp. PANDURANQ VAMAN KANE 

National Professor of Indology 



Vol. Ill 

Second Edition 



Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona 
1973 



PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION 

The second volume of the History of Dhamiasfistra was 
published in the third quarter of 1941. In the Preface to that 
volume I held forth hopes that the next volume dealing with tiio 
remaining subjects comprised in Dharmasastra might he placed 
before scholars in about throe years thereafter. The Great War 
was then being fought in Europe and it was generally believed 
that India would remain free from the fear of actual invasion. 
But such fond hopes were shattered by the sudden attack on Pearl 
Harbour by Japanese bombers on 7th December 1941. Japan 
gained rapid and phenomenal victories and within about three 
months from the attack on Poarl Harbour vast territories from 
the Philippines to Burma fell into the hands of the victors. 
Calcutta and Trincomalee were bombed. Serious fears were 
entertained about an invasion of the mainland of India by land, 
sea and air. There was great panic in such coastal cities as 
Madras, Bombay and Karachi. The matters uppermost in the 
minds of Government officials and the members of the public 
were A. R. P. measures, the recruiting of men for the army, 
navy and air force and the removal of families and valuables to 
places of safety in the interior. Important and rare books from 
the libraries of the Bombay Asiatic Society and of the Univer- 
sity of Bombay were taken to distant places for reasons of 
security. During almost the whole of 1943 it was very difficult 
for me to work on the preparation of the third volume in the 
midst of a general atmosphere of panic caused by the fear of 
invasion and the removal of valuable reference books from 
Bombay Owing to the war there has been great scarcity of 
paper and printing also has become very costly. I decided upon 
writing only on a few of the several subjects that remained to 
be dealt with and chose Byajadharma, Vyavahara and Sadficara, 
the treatment of which is now placed before the public. Scarcity 
of paper and labour is responsible for the fact that this third 
volume has been in the press for nearly three years. The present 
volume increased in bulk beyond expectation The fourth and 
last volume will deal with the following subjects: Pataka, 
karraavipaka and pr&yascitta; antyesti, asauca and sraddha; 
tlrtha,- vrata; kalaandmuhfirta; santi; PaurSna dharma; the 
influence of the Purvamlmamsa and other sastras on dharma- 
sastra; the Teligions and philosophical background of dharma- 
sastraj the essentials of our culture, its future, the coming 



vi Jltslory of Dharmaiasha 

social and other trends and their impact on the dogmas and 
ideals of DharmasSbtra. I am personally anxious to finish all 
the remaining work as early as possible But looking to my 
age ( I am nearly 67 now ), to my ailments and to the number 
of subjects that remain to be dealt with, it is impossible for mo 
to say when the next and last volume may be published. Tins 
volume also is full of quotations, refers to many inscriptions, 
judicial decisions and legislative enactments. The reasons for 
this have been stated at length in the Preface to the second 
volume and I do not desire to repeat them hero In the general 
index to the second volume full references to works like the 
Mauusmrti wore not given, because suoh works were quoted on 
almost every page But Borne critics found fault with this, 
therefore in the index to this volume full references to all works 
arc inserted. 

All that now remains is the pleasant duty of acknowledg- 
ing my obligations to others. Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance, 
the Vedic Index of Professors Macdonell and Keith and several 
volumes of the Sacred Books of the East have been very useful 
in preparing this volume as in the case of the preceding one. 
I wish to mention specially the debt I owe to the late Maha- 
mahopadhyaya Kanialakrsna Smrtitlrtha for his editorial work 
on twelve volumes on the different branches of dharmasastra, 
which have been of great use to me in writing all the volumes 
of my History viz. Haralata, Viva daratnakara, Grhastharatna- 
kara, Krtyaratnakara, TIrthaointamani. Varsaknyakaumudl, 
DanakriySkaumudl, Sraddhakriyakaumudl, SuddhikaumudI, 
Dandaviveka, Bajadharmakaustubha and Agastyasamhita. I am 
highly obliged to Paramahamsa Svaml Kevalananda Sarasvati 
of Wai for frequent help and guidance m solving some intricate 
problems of Dharmasastra, to Prof N. A Gore, M. A. of Poona 
for help in the careful correction of proofs, to Tarkatlrtha 
Raghunathasastri Kokje of Lonavla and Mi. N. G Chapekari 
BA..LL.B (TetiredF. Sub-judge ), of Badlapur for reading 
through the whole volume and suggesting some additions and 
corrections. 

Assistance m various ways during the progress of the work 
for the last four years was very kindly rendered by a host of 
friends and acquaintances, among whom I should like to make 
special mention of Prof H. D. Velankar, Dr B N Dandekar, 
Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, Bao Bahadur Prof. Bangaswami Aiyangar, 
Dr. A. S Altekar, Mr. P. K. Gode, Dr. Baghavan, Mr. S N Joshi 
of Bharata-itihasa-samsodhaka-mandala atPoona.Mr.Bhabatosh 



Pirfuci' vii 

Bhattacharya ( son of M M Katnalakrsna Smrtilirth.i ), 
Mr S L Katre of Ujjain, Prof. A, M. Pniamasivanandan of 
Pacchaiappa College at Madras, the laic Pandit Rangaenrya 
JRaddi. Thanks are duo to all these and many others for help 
and interest in this volume. It need not ho expressly staled that 
1 alone am lesponsiblo for the views and mistakes contained in 
this volume J sincerely thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan 
Press, Poona, for carrying out the work of printing with care 
and promptitude in spite of difficulties caused by war conditions 
and paper and labour shortage 

In a work bristling with thourands of quotations and 
inferences it is likely that many slips have escaped attention 
The indulgence of the readei is sought for forgiveness in the 
matter of several misprints in the footnotes caused by loss or 
displacement of the pails of letters in the process of printing

BAJADHARMA 

(GOVERNMENT AND STATECRAFT) 

CHAPTER I 

Rsjadharma has been a subject of discussion in works on 
dharmasastra from -very ancient times. The Ap. Dh. S. 11 9 25.1 
says 'The general and special dharniaa of all varnas have been 
explained: but now we shall declare the dliannas of a king in 
particular'. Ap then states that the king should cause to be 
built a capital and a palace, the gates of which both should face 
the south; that the palace should be in the heart of the capital; 
that in front of the capital there was to be a hall called ' Sraan- 
trana' (hall of invitation); that to the south of the town there 
was to be an assembly house with doors on the north and south. 
Ap requires that in the king's realm no brShmana should suffer 
hunger, sickness, cold or heat; Ap gives regulations about the 
assembly house and about persons who were to be allowed to 
engage in gambling; he prescribes that (the exercise in) anns, 
dancing, singing and music should not go on anywhere except 
in the houses of the king's servants, that the king was to see 
that there was no danger from thieves in villages and forests, 
that the king should donate fields and money to brahmanas 
according to their worth without detriment to his servants, that 
the king who meets death in recovering the property of brah- 
manas and other warlike persons who meet death in fighting for 
a similar worthy cause reap the merit of a sacrifice (i. e reach 
heaven as reward); that the king should appoint in towns and 
Villages officers and their subordinates, who are pure and truth- 
ful for the protection of the subjects against thieves and who

it to perish Ho states that if the king does not punish the 
guilty he incurs sin, that in disputes judges should be men of 
learning, clever and fulfilling their duties, that witnesses were 
to tell the truth and were to be punished if they be untruthful 
It will be noticed how Ap briefly covers the whole field of raja- 
dharma In the Santiparva of the Mahabharata rajadharma is 
dealt with at great length in chapters 56-130 and to some extent 
in 131-172 The Manusmrti also states at the beginning of 
chap VII (1) that it will expound rajadharmas That great 
literaiy activity on the science and art of government went on 
for many cental ies before the Christian era follows from several 
considerations The Anusasanaparva (chap 39 8) speaks of 
the sastras composed by Brhaspati and Usanas The Santi- 
parva (58 1-3) names as expounders of rajasiistra Brhaspati, 
Bharadvaja, Gaurasiras, Kavya, Mahendra, Manu Pracetasa and 
Visalaksa Santiparva ( 102 31-32 ) opposes the view of Sambara 
to that of acaryas 1 The Arthasastra of Kautilya mentions five 
schools ( viz those of the Manavas, the Barhaspatyas, the Ausa- 
nasas, the Parasaras and the Ambhiyas), seven individual tea- 
chers (V. 5, and 18) only once (viz Bahudantfputra, Dlrgha 
Oarayana, Ghotaraukha, Kaninka Bharadvaja, Katyayana, Kifi- 
jalka, Pisunaputra, ) and several times mentions the views of 
BhaTadvaja, Kaunapadanta, Parasara, Pisuna, Vatavyadhi, 
Visalaksa. Kautilya also cites at least 53 times the views 
of ScaryaB, almost in every case for dissent Santi 10344 
refers to a Bhasya on rajasastra Is it possible to see 
mthis a reference to one out of the bhasyakaras indicated 
in the verse appended at the end of the Kautiliya or to the 
Kautiliya itself ? Another fact indicative of the systematiza- 
tion of the science of government is' that in the Mahabharata, 
the Ramayana, Manu and Kautilya ideas expressed by numbers 
had already been stereotyped long before those works were 
written viz such as saptanga rajya (State with seven constituent 
elements), sadgunya (the six ways of policy viz alliance, 
declaration of war &c ), three safe, the four upayas (sama, 
dana, bheda, danda ), astavarga, and paneavarga ( Manu VXL 155), 
the 18 and 15 tirthas (Sabhaparva 5 38) 8 For detailed information

about the Rajasastras of Brhaspati, Usanas, Bharadvaja oullod 
from the Mahabharata and other anoiont works vide my paper 
on them in the Journal of the University of Bombay, vol. XI 
part 2 pp. 73-83, 1942. 

The fulfilment of their duties and responsibilities by rulers 
was of paramount importance to the stability and orderly develop- 
ment of society and to the happiness of individuals in the Stale 
and therefore one often finds that rajadharma is said to be the root 
of or the quintesseuce of all dharmas. Santiparva ( 63.25 ) states 
'know that all dharmas are merged in rajadharma; that 
rajadharmas are at the head of all dharmas' and (1419-10) 
' the welfare, good rains, sickness, calamities and death among 
people owe their origin to the king 3 '. It was the king's duty to 
see that the people in his kingdom acted according to the rules 
laid down in the smrtis for the several varnas and asramas, to 
administer justice and to interfere when his help was sought 
for by a pansad ( assembly of learned men ) in enforcing the 
prayasaUa (penance) prescribed for various lapses. "Vide 
Gautama X. 7-8, XL 9-11, &p. Dh. S H. 5 10. 13-16*, Vasistha 
19 1-2, Visnu m. 2-3, Narada (praklrnaka, 5-7 and 33-34), 
Santiparva 77 33 and 57 15, Matsyapurana 215.63, Markandeya- 
purana 27 28 and 2836 and H.Dh. vol. Up. 965. Therefore 
it may be said with truth (as done by the Mahabharata) that 
rajadharma was the highest goal of all the world, that it com- 
prehended within itself all rules of ucara, vyavahara (admini- 
stration of justice ) and prayotcitta (penance ). It is on account 

S ?£ ^f If diDg inflUen ° e 0f government or royal power

59-60 } remarks that ono should learn from sast.ra what, are good 
and evil actions, give up evil deeds and perform good ones and 
that the king is hence declared to be the cause of ( good or evil ) 
times according as he does good or evil acts Sukra IV. 1, 60 states 
that the king is the prompter of his age 

Though rajadharma was thus an integral part of dharma- 
sastra and was one of the most important subjects therein, yet. 
apart from the works on dharmasastra separate treatises dealing 
with rajadharma alone came into existence in veiy early times 
Santiparva (chap 59) states that originally in the Krta age 
there 1 was no king nor punishment, that then moha (delusion), 
greed and lust entered men, that in order to provide against 
the complete destruction of dharma, Brahma composed a work 
in one hundred thousand chapters on dharma, artha, kania and 
moksa ( verses 30 and 79 ) , that part of this work on Nlti ( science 
of government) was abridged by Sankara Visalaksa (verse 80, 
and so it was called Vaisalaksa) into 10000 chapters, that Indra 
studied it and reduced it to 5000 chapters (and the work was 
called Bahudantaka, verse 83), that it was compressed into 
3000 chapters by Brhaspati (and so was called Barhaspatya ) 
and that Kavya (Usanas) reduced the work to 1000 chapters. 
The Kamasutra (I 5-8) contains a somewhat similar story that 
Prajapati composed a work in one hundred thousand chapters, 
that Manu abridged it as regards dharma, Brhaspati as regards 
artha and Nandi abridged in 1000 chapters the science of erotics- 
The Santiparva (69) gives (verses 33-74) a summary of the 
contents of the work of Brahma. on.rajadharma which remarkab- 
ly agrees with the principal topics of the Kautillya 

The Nitiprakasika (I 21-23 ) states that Brahma, Mahesvara, 
Skanda, Indra, Pracetasa Manu, Brhaspati, Sukra, Bharadvaja, 
Veda-Vyasa, Gaurasiras were the expounders of Eajasastra, 
that Brahma composed a work on rajasastra in 100000 chapters, 
which was gradually reduced in size by each of the above- 
mentioned founders until Gaurasiras reduced it to 500 chapters 
and VySsa to 300 The Sukranltisara (I 3-4) states that Brahma 
composed nltisastra in 100000 verses, which was subsequently 
abridged by Vasistha and others (including Sukra) 

It is interesting to note the names given to the science of 
government The most appropriate word is 'rajasastra' and 
it is employed by the Mahabharata, which speaks of Brhaspati, 
Bharadvaja and others as 'rajasastra-pranetarah' (vide p 2 abovej 
The Nltiprakssika (1.21-23) also dubs the divine and human 



HI] , RBjadltarma 5 

writers on government ' rajasSstranam pranetarah. ' The samo 
word is employed by such ancient classical writers fts Asvaghosa 
in his Buddhacarita (I. 46 ). 6 The fiist verse in Piof Edger ton's 
reconstructed Pancatantra performs obeisance to Manu, Brhas- 
pati, Sukra, PaTasara and his son and Canakya a<5 the authors 
of nrpasastra (science of kingship) Another name is Eanfanih. 
The Santiparva (59.78) explains why Dandanlti is so called 
viz 'this world is led (on to the right path) bydanda(the 
power of punishment, sanction) or thi<? science carries (or sets 
forth) the rod of punishment; hence it is called dandanlti and 
it (faces) pervades the three worlds * In Santiparva 69, 76 it is 
stated that ' Dandanlti controls the four varnas so as to lead 
them on to the performance of their duties and when it i* 
employed by the mler properly, it makes them desist from 
adharma ' 7 Santi 63. 28 identifies Dandanlti with rajadharmas 
The Kautiliya (1.4) explains 'Danda is the means of the 
stability and welfare of invlksikl, Trayl (the three Vcdas) 
and Varta; the rules that treat of danda are called dandanlti, 
which is a means of acquiring what has not been acquired, 
which safeguards what is acquired, which increases what is 
guarded and distributes (increased wealth) among the deserv- 
ing.* The Mahabharata says ( Santi 69. 102 ) that a wise ksatriya, 
putting dandanlti in front, should always desire to acquire what 
is till then unacquired and should guard what is acquired. » The 
Nltisara (IL15) says that damn (control or chastisement) is 
called danda, the king is called 'danda' because control is 
centered in him; that the nlti (rules) of danda is called danda- 
nlti and nlti is so called because it leads (people).' ,0 Santi (69. 104) 
says that dandanlti is the special concern of the ksatriya (rajan ). 
It is said in the Vanaparva 150. 32 that without Dandanlti this

whole world would break all bounds Vide also Santi 15.29, 
63.28, 69.74 ff (eulogy of Dandanlti) Dandanlti is said to be 
the mpport of the world (Santi 12124) and to have been 
produced by Devi Sarasvatl (Santi 122 25 ) 

Arthasastra haB been a synonym for dandanlti When the 
Ap. Dh. S. EL 5 10 16 requires the king to appoint as purohita a 
brahmana well-versed in dharma and artha, it is clear that 
Apastamba has in view dharmasastra and arthasastra The 
Anuaasanaparva says that Brhaspati and others composed artha- 
sastras (39.10-11) Dronaparva 6 1 speaks of a science of artha 
composed by Manu {Mavaw. arthavidya) Vide Jayaswal in 
'Maim and Yajnavalkya' ( pp. 5, 7, 16, 25, 26, 41, 42, 50, 84, 
for Manu and Artha ) Santi (71 14) states that a king whose sole 
concern is with arthasastra does not secure dharma and kSma 
and that all the wealth of such a king vanishes in ( the pursuit 
of ) improper objects. Vide Santi 302 109 which speaks of artha- 
sastra as resorted to by the best among kings. The Bam&yana 
(II 100. 14; states that Sudhanva, TJpadhyaya of Rama, was an 
adept in arthasastra. The arthasastra of Kautilya starts with 
the statement that it is the quintessence of all the arthasastras 
composed by former teachers in the whole world and at the end 
Kautilya states that that sastra which is a means of acquiring 
and guarding the earth is arthasastra This mentions two of 
the four objects of dandanlti stated in the Kautillya itself ( as 
shown in n 8 above) Only two objects are mentioned by Kautilya 
( as in Santi 69 102 ) since they are the first and principal ones 
to be gained by the practice of the science of government. It 
is not meant that there was, as regards the topics to be dealt 
with, any distinction between Dandanlti and Arthasastra The 
four objects mentioned by Kautilya are always placed before 
the ksatriya by Manu (VH 99-100), Santi 102 57 and 140 5, 
Yaj. I. 317, JNltisSra I 18 ( while 1 8 mentions only two purposes 
of rajavidyS ) At the end (XV 1) Kautilya states ' artha is the 
sustenance of human beings, that is, the earth peopled by men 
That sSstra which is a means of acquiring and guarding that 
earth is arthasastra ' Men derive their sustenance from the 
earth and all wealth also arises from the earth. Mr Jayaswal 
( Hindu Polity p 5 ) is not right when he translates ' Artha is 
human population ' Vide D Ghoshal's 'Hindu Political 
Theories ' p 74 n and p 76 for the various interpretations of this 
passage by Jayaswal and others Authors a few centuries later 
than both the Mahabharata and the Kautillya treat the two as 



HI ] ttja&harma 1 

identical. Dandinin life Dasakumaracarita (VUL) expressly 
says that Visnugupta composed his work on dandanlti for the 
Maurya king in 6000 slokas, though the Kautiliya states at the 
very beginning that the work is an arthasastra Dandin in the 
same context refers to ' Arthasastras as helping to polish the 
intellect' and speaks of some of the predecessors mentioned by 
Kautilya as writers on the sastra ( viz. the Arthasastra )." The 
Araarakosa treats the two as identical. n Medhatitbi on Manu 
VJL 43 holds that the word ' Dandanlti ' therein ref ere to the 
works of Canakya and others The MitSksaTi or. Taj. L 313 
paraphrases dandanlti hy arthasastra and on Taj. 1 311 explains 
dandanlti as the lore useful in the acquisition and guarding of 
wealth ( only the two objects mentioned by Kautilya in connec- 
tion with arthasastra ) According to the Sukranltisara ( IV. 3 56 ) 
'that is said to be arthasastra in which instruction about the 
conduct of kings and the like is given without coming in 
conflict with Sruti and Smrti and in which the acquisition of 
wealth with great skill is taught '. 

The words arthasastra and dandanlti are applied to the 
science of government from two different points of view. Artha 
is defined in the KamasQtra (120) as 'education, lands, gold, 
cattle, corn, domestic utensils and friends and the augmenting 
of what is acquired' (vide H. Dh. Vol H part I p. 9 note 23 > 
inerefore when wealth and prosperity of all kinds is the spring 
and motive of giving a name the science treating of these is 
called arthasastra and when the government of the people and 
aepumshment of offenders axe the main ideas the same is

' duties' (dharmasabdah kartavyatSvacanah), that the duties of 
the king are either dratartha (i e the effects of which are 
worldly and visible) such as the employment of six gunas 
(sandhi, vigraha &o ) or adrstartha (that have no visible effect 
but have a spiritual result) such as Agnihotra; here (in chap 
Vn-IX of Manu) the remarks relate principally to dratartha 
matters since it is well-known that the -word rajadharma is appli- 
cable to such matters ( the six gunas &c ) only 18 Medhatithi 
here declares that the rules of rajanlti are not based on the 
canonical books of dharmasastra but piincipally on the ex- 
perience of worldly affairs 

Another name for the science of government is Nltisastra 
or Rajanltisastra Santi" 59 74 says that in the nltisastra are 
set forth all those means whereby people are prevented from 
forsaking the right path The Nltisara of Katnandaka 15 (16) 
does obeisance to Visnugupta who extracted the nectar of Nlti- 
sastra from the vast ocean of Arthasastra (works). The Panca- 
tantra p 2 holds that Arthasastra and Nltisastra are synony- 
mous The Mitaksara on Taj Q. 21 remarks that the arthasastra 
referred to by Yaj is rajanltisastra that is part and parcel of 
dharmasastra The word 'rajanlti* occurs in Raghuvamsa 17 68 
Vide Bhagavadglta X. 38, Asramavasikaparva 6.5, Manu "vTL 
177, Santi 111 73, 138,39, 43 and 196, 268 9 and AnusSsana 163 7 
for Nltisastra meaning Arthasastra or Rajanlti and Drona 152 29 
and Santi 37 9 for the word rajanlti Another noteworthy word 
is 'naya' which means 'line of policy' and is employed by 
the Arthasastra ( 1 2 ) when it says ' naya and anaya (bad policy ) 
are treated of in Dandanlti '. It is also used in several classical 
works, such as the Kiratarjunlya (IL 3, 12, 54, XHL 17 ). 

The relation of arthasastra to dharmasastra has now 
to be understood. As stated above rajadharma is a very 
important subject of dharma-sastra Arthasastra which is 
principally concerned with the rights, privileges and res- 
ponsibilities of the ruler is therefore properly speaking a 
part of dharmasastra As shown above it is supposed to have

like dharmasastra a divine source But works on arthasastra 
enter into great details abonttho government of a country in all 
its aspects, while dharmasastra works generally deal only with 
a few salient features of rajasastra Just as the Kamasutra 
(12 14) states that dhanna is the highest goal and karaa is 
the lowest of the three purusarthas ( vide H. Dh. vol. H part 1 
p 9 ), so AxtbasSstra also sets the highest value on dharma 
The Kautillya states ( 111. 1. at end )" ' In any matter where 
there is a conflict between dharmasastra and practices or hetween 
dharmasastra and any secular transaction, ( the king ) should 
decide that matter hy relying on dharma. If sastra comes in 
conflict with any rational and equitable rule then the latter 
shall be the deciding factor and the ( strict ) letter of the text 
will be nowhere'. But Kautttya and other writers on artha- 
sSstra lay the greatest emphasis on aitha In the eager 
and relentless pursuit of worldly prosperity moans may be 
recommended or followed which may come in conflict with the 
strictly ethical standpoint of the dictates of dharmasastra. In 
such cases of conflict dharmasastra works lay down ( e. g. £p, 
Dh. L9. 21 28, Taj. H. 21, Narada, vyavaharamatrka chap. 1 39 j 
that dharmasastra rules are to be preferred to the dictates of 
arthasastra. Visvarupa ( on Yaj. H. 21 ) states that according 
to some predecessors of his the conflict between the dictates of 
dharmasastra and arthasastra is illustrated as follows. Manu 
VUL 351 (which 1b the same as Vismv-dharmasfitra V 190 
and Matsyapurana 227. 116-117 ) when dealing with vyavahara 
(a subject that preeminently belongs to arthasSstra) provides 
feat u Ming an afettym, no fault attaches to the killer : while

this illustration. The Mitaksara also refers to this example, 
disapproves of it and gives its own example The Arthasastra 
declares that a king should endeavour to secure friends, since 
the acquisition of friends is superior to the acquisition of gold 
and land ( as is laid down in Yaj I 352 ) The rule of dharma- 
sastra is that a king has to dispense justice, being free from 
anger and avarice and in accordance with dharmasastra There- 
fore when a suit comes before a king he must decide it according 
to law, even though he may lose the friendship of a person if his 
decision goes against the latter The Vlramitrodaya follows the 
Mitaksara Dharmasastra went by the name of smrti (Mann U 10), 
while arthasastra was treated as an TJpaveda The Visnupurana 
HL 6. 28, Vayu 61. 79 and Brahmanda 35 88-59 mention the 
four Upavedas l7 viz Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and 
Arthasastra as affiliated to the four Vedas respectively viz. 
Bgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda Kautilya 
(15) states tnat the king should listen to the recital of ttthasa 
in the latter part of the day and includes both dharmasastra 
and arthasastra under itihasa" and requires the minister know- 
ing arthasastra to advise the king (with examples and precepts 
derived) from itihasa and purana 

Though Arthasastra is in theory for keeping to the path of 
dharma, one cannot blink one's eyes to the fact that the Maha- 
bharata and the Kautillya both support in several places the 
adoption of means entirely divorced from all rules of fair deal- 
ing and morality In Adiparva 140 we have 'a 'discourse by 
Kanika said to have been a manlun of Dhrtarastra and a pro- 
found student of Rajasastra, which is almost on the same lines 
as Santiparva chap 140 where Bhlsma sets out what lines ot 
policy {nth) should be followed by the ruler 'in adversity and 
how he should give up all thoughts of kindliness in such straits 
He is supposed to give the substance of the dialogue between 
the sage Bharadvaja and Satruntapa, king of Sauvlra The 
whole chapter is full of Machiavellian advice. A few speci- 
mens may be set out here One should be very courteous in 
speech, but like a razor at heart (verse 13); one desirous of 
prosperity may fold one's h ands, may take an oath, may use

sweet words, place Ms head on another's feet and even shed 
tears, one may carry on one'B shoulders one's enemy till one 
accomplishes one's ohject and when a fit opportunity arises 
should break him like an earthen pot on a stone ( 17-18 ) ; the 
king should raise hopes promising their fulfilment at a distant 
day, but should put obstacles in the fulfilment of the hopes 
raised in others (32) ; when one is reduced to a wretched state 
one may extricate oneself from it by any act whatever 
whether gentle or horrible and practise dbarma after one 
becomes able to do so '(38) ; one should inspire confidence in 
one's enemy by some means which appear to be true ( to the 
enemy ), but one Bhould strike him down at the right moment 
when he takes a wrong Btep (44) ; whoever causes obstacles to 
the purpose of the king, whether son or brother or father or 
friend, Bhould be killed by the king who desires to prosper (47); 
without cutting the vitalB of others, -without committing horrible 
deeds and without killing indiscriminately as the fisherman in 
the case of fish one does not secure high prosperity (50) ; when 
about to strike one Bhould utter sweet words and even after 
BtriMng one should use honeyed words*, even after severing 
another's head with a sword one should lament and shed 
tears (54) ; if some remainder is left in the case of a debt or fire 
or enemies, there is a tendency to grow and so no remainder 
should be left of these (58) It is to be noted that this chapter 
deals specially with what should be done in difficulties and can- 
not be supposed to be the real teaching of the Mahahh&rata 
which is generally in line with the higher code of dbarma- 
sastra It embodied probably the words of earlier arthasSstra 
writers like Bharadvaja. After hearing this discourse on 
calculated cruelty and deceit Yudhisthira stood aghast and 
frankly told Bhlsma that the course of conduct outlined by him 
did not differ from that of robbers and that he felt bewildered 
andwouldnot.exerthimselfinthewaypointedout In chap 142 
Bhlsma replies to this by saying that he did not base his dis- 
course merely on the sacred tests, but also on reason and the 
essence was distilled by wise men, that the considered rule of 
conduct for the king is twofold, viz. straightforward and crooked 
that one should not ordinarily employ the crooked course of 
conduct but should employ it as against an enemy who employs 
a crooked policy and effectively meet him by such policy. He 
further says that raiadfmrma cannot he based on a single

( v 17 ) and that Indra himself has declared this rule -which 
he derived from Brhaspati. In Santi-parva a weak king is 
advised to harass a very powerful ruler's state by sword, foe 
and poison In chap 130 it is stated that the preservation 
of the state is the paramount consideration and that a 
king whose treasury is depleted and who is therefore in diffi- 
culties may replenish his treasury even by harassing his 
subjects ( except tapasas and learned brahmanas ) In ohap 138 
it is said that self-interest makes friends or foes and that 
amsvasa ( putting trust in no one ) is the grand line of policy 
for kings So it is clear that the Mahabharata was prepared to 
give up in certain circumstances the strict rules of dhannasastra 
for kings and to allow them to pursue devious modes of action 
that were far from moral i e . it tries to effect a synthesis of 
dharmasastra and arthasastra , . 

The Kautillya also discloses how arthasastra writers did 
not shrink from giving advice which, to say the least, was 
most cruel, selfish and immoral For example, in the section 
called ' guarding the prince ' ( Kaut L 17 ) the views of several 
teachers aTe set out Bharadvaja says that princes are of the 
nature of, crabs eating up their parent; so it is better to finish 
ihem in secret when they have no love for their father 
Visalaksa abhorred this advice as cruel^as unsanctioned murder 
and as destructive of the seed of ksatriyas and recommended 
that it was better to keep them confined in a single spot 
Vatavyadhi recommended that princes should be made addicted 
to sensual excesses Kaut disapproves of this a<3 living death 
( for the princes ), recommends proper care before conception and 
after birth and instruction in dhaTma In Kaut V. 6 Bharadvaja 
is quoted as saying that when the king is on his death-bed, the 
minister may set up the kinsmen of the king and the principal 
princes against one "another, that whoever attacks should be 
killed by inciting the people against him, or having secretly 
punished the kinsmen and chief princes and brought them 
under control, the minister should himself take possession of 
the kingdom. Kautilya does not approve of this But even he 
advises (XEV Aupanisadika ) the employment of poison, herbs 
and incantations against those who are irreligious or wicked 
In L 18 even Kaut does not shrink from advising that secret 
emissaries ( of the reigning king ) may kill an abandoned pmoa 
with weapons and poison and in V. 1 Kaut remarks that, when 
a king cannot openly put down the principal couriers or chiefs 



IE 1 Rajadliarma 13 

who are dangerous to the kingdom, he may inflict punishment 
on them in secret or may induce the brother of the officer to be 
punished to attack the latter by promising to give him the posit- 
ion and wealth of the officer and then destroy that attacker with 
weapons or poison saying that he was guilty of fratricide In 
V. 2 for replenishing a "depleted treasury Kautilya coolly asks 
the king to deprive the temples in the kingdom of their wealth 
through the superintendent of religious endowments 

Sanskrit literature on rajadliarma is very extensive. Apart 
from the meagre materials contained in such ancient dbarma- 
sfitras as that of Apastamba, the following works deserve close 
study and have been utilized in this section*, the Mah&bharala 
(Vanaparva 150, Sabha 5, ITdyoga 33-34, Santi 1-130, Asrama-

In recent times there is a deluge of works mostly inspired by the

oarticulars from those of the other two But the authentic data furnished by 
South India are later by centuries than those supplied by the north and 
besides are comparatively meagre. Therefore in this wort : one : has to

proposed is to indicate and dilate upon only the fundamental 
ideas and principles of the Beveral matters falling under raja- 
dharma. Nor is it possible to enter here into formal and lengthy 
refutations of the several views propounded by "Western and 
Indian writers about the forms and functions of Government 
and the state of society in ancient India. Most of the modern 
works referred to in note 19 above are more or less based on the 
same material in Sanskrit and Pali, hut the emotional or subjec- 
tive element is different in each case. Some western writorB 
have without very solid foundations iudulged in a facile and 
sweeping generalization that the great Empires of antiquity 
such as those of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Medians 
and Persians and the Indians were mainly tax-gathering insti- 
tutions (vide Sir Henry Maine's 'Early History of Institutions' 
1875, pp. 384 and 390; and Prof. Rangaiwami Aiyangar's 
'Ancient Indian Polity' 1935, pp. 5—6 and pp. 66-69 (where 
passages from T.H. Green and others are cited); while some 
Indian writers vehemently assert that the Government in An- 
cient India was always Borne form of limited monarchy. Both 
characterisations are in my opinion misleading An endeavour 
will be made to present from the original texts as true a picture 
of the polity of ancient and medieval India as it is possible for 
me to do. It will do no good to label the ancient institutions of 
India with concepts and terms current in the West during the last 
one hundred and fifty years or so. Even in the West true democra- 
cies or real democratic governments did not exist and the masses 
in no country had elective popular assemblies or councils before 
the last quarter of the 18th century. Such assemblies do not 
exist even now in several countries of Europe Even in the 
ancient Greek city states the number of slaves who had no voice 
fH ^*T ent was Be ™al tta« as large as the free citizens 
and those states were no democracies at all in the strict sense »» 
Indian polity has a recorded history of over two thousand years 
from at least the 4th century B.0 Its growth was gradual

CHAPTER H 
SEVEN ANGAS OF RSJYA 

According to almost all of our authorities a state (rS?z/a) is 
constituted by seven elements 80 viz svamin (ruler or sovereign ), 
amalya (minister), janapada or ra$tra (the territory of the State 
and its people), durga (fortified city or capital), kosa (accumula- 
ted wealth in the ruler's treasury), daiida (army), mtlra (friends 
or allies). These seven are called angas or prakrtts The word 
prakrti in works on politics is also used for the constituents of a 
circle of states (of a mandala ) Vide Manu VII 156 and Kau- 
tilya ( V12). The word also means ministers as in Sukranltisara 
H. 70-73 and 'subjects' in Kharavela's Inscription (E. I vol. 20 
p.79 1. 4), HaTada (praklrnaka 5), Raghuvamsa VUL 18. The 
order in which these are arranged and their names vary a 
good deal. The <juotations given below will indicate how the 
order differs. The sequence is important for the reason that 
some of our authorities expressly state that when calamities be- 
fall or deterioration sets in each of the seven elements, those 
that befall each preceding one are more serious for 'the State 
than those of each succeeding one (Kautily a VUJL1, Manu IX. 
295). Wot janapada sometimes the word jam or raqtra is used, for 
'danda' the word' bala' and the word "pura* for 'durga'. The 
Asramavasiparva (58) speaks of eight angas of rdjya. Accord- 
ing to Sumantu quoted by the Sarasvativilasa (p 46 ) danda 
means " punishment bodily or monetary " and ' army * is inclu ded 
under 'kosa'. Sumantu says that th eavamin has to be preserved 
by himself, the ministers by showing them proper respect, the 
people by keeping them contented, the fortified capital by abun- 
dance of wealth and grain, the kosa by proper expenditure, danda

by following one's dharma, friends by truthfulness. The autho- 
rities are agreed that the ruler is the most important or the first 
of the seven. Eautilya puts the matter very forcibly and realis- 
tically when he states that the briefest exposition of the elements 
of rajya is to say that the king is the State 8I . This is really not 
the same doctrine as that emphasized by Louis XIV of France 
when he said ' L'Etal c'est mm '. Eautilya makes his position clear 
(in VUL 1) by saying that it is the king who appoints ministers 
and servants and superintendents, who takes measures of relief 
against calamities befalling the other prakrtis and measures of 
prosperity, that it is he who appoints other ministers when those 
already appointed are under calamities, that if the ruler is pros- 
perous he transmits prosperity to his prakrtis, that the prakrtis 
bear that character which the king has and that hence the ruler 
occupies the position of a permanent, never-exhausted centre ot 
power. The Sukranltisara H.4 remarks that if the king begins 
to act at his sweet will, it leads to calamities, to loss of ministers 
and of the kingdom The Sukranltisara (I 61-62) compaies 
the seven angas of rajya to the organs of the body viz , the king 
is the head, the ministers are the eyes, ally the ear, treasury the 
mouth, the army the mind, capital and rastra are hands and feet. 
It is emphasized by Earn. (IV.1-2) that each of the seven elements 
is complementary to the others, that if the state is defective 
even in one out of the seven elements it does not pull well, 
the) Santiparva it is stated that it is not possible to say 
categorically that any one of the seven excels the others in merit. 
but that at different times a different element assumes importance 
over others, .since that particular element is in the particular 
circumstances capable of accomplishing the purpose in hand 
This shows that Manu and the Mahabharata held that there was 
an organic unity in the several elements of , rajya AH must 
work harmoniously towards one ideal or end Manu (JA 
396-397) says this by means of a simile 'Just as among the 
three staves tied together (by a rope of cow's hair) used by a 
sannyustn no particular staff is superior (to the others), so among

the Beven elements of the state no particular one can be said 
to excel the othere, since each of them has a particular excellence 
of its own; a particular element is pre-eminent in Borne 
particular matter and therefore the superiority of one to the 
others when expressed ( as e. g. in Manu EC 295 ) is to be 
confined to that matter alone.' Manu here emphasizes the 
harmonious working or unity of the seven elements though 
they are diverse in their individual characters. The analysis 
of the elements and nature of the State led ancient Indian 
writers to hold that a mere conglomeration of people did not by 
itself constitute a State, but that for a State there must be 
people who live within certain definite geographical limits 
( rSstra ), they must be hound by the bond to render allegiance to a 
ruler ( svaml), have a certain system of government (amstya), 
must have a regulated economic system, a force for defence and 
international relationships. That is, the most essential 
elements of a state are (1) a sovereign, (2) a system of govern* 
ment, (3) a definite territory and (4) a population of some siie. 
These four were known even to the most ancient sufcras. Vide 
Gaut. 31 1 (r&ia), £p. H, 6. 25. 10 (amatya), &p, & 10. 25. 11, 
H. 10. 26. 4 (visaya, nagara, grSma), Gaut XL 5-8 (prajS). 

These seven elements will now be dealt with one after 
another. 

It Bhould be noted that neither jKautilya nor Kamandaka 
defines rajya. Etymologically it mean B the ' karma * or «bh£va' 
( activity or state of a king ) •, being derived from ' rajan ' with 
the affix « ya ' ( syafi or * yak \ ace. to Panini V. 1. 124 and 128 ) 
This is the etymological meaning. But * r&jya ' is employed in 
the sense of 'kingdom' in popular parlance and also* in the 
smrtis and works on polity as in Manu VH. Ill, Kam 
331181-82 But when it is said that ' rajya • has seven elements' 
aen rajya has a very wide meaning ana stands for the king 
tta i ministers, the country and its people and the economic and 
m^tary resources and in such a case it is proper to translate 
the word as 'the State ' ( as including both the Governmental 
the governed . m some cases 'rajya' should be rendered as 
government' which includes only the king and his ministeS

Medh&tithi on Manu YDI. 1 remarks that rajya meanB 'a 
prosperous people*. In 2HL 4 Kautflya states («a hyajano 
janapado rajyam janapadam va bhavatiti Kautilydh) it as his 
opinion that a territory without any inhabitants cannot become 
a rajya (a kingdom) or a janapada (as one of the seven 
elements). Sahara on Jai. II. 3, 3 has a discourse on the deri- 
vation of rajya, 

Prof. Bhandarkar in 'Some ABpeots of Ancient Indian Polity' 
(pp. 66-89 ), JayaBwal in ' Hindu Polity ' part H p 9, Prof. B K 
Sarkar in ' Positive Background of Hindu Sociology ' Book II 
pp 34-39 and others maintain that this ancient analysis of 
rajya into Eeven elements shows that the idea of the State as 
an organism, that is, the organic theory of the State was known 
to Hindu thinkers and that this doctrine of saplanga rajya 11 * 
satisfies the definition of the State given by Bluntsohli and 
others On the other hand Mr Anjarja in chapter IV of his 
' Nature and grounds of political obligation in the Hindu state ' 
after pointing out how there are different versions of the 
organic theory of the Btate denies vehemently that the Hindu 
theory can he called a proper organic theory of the State, 
particularly because the Hindu thinkers did not regard the 
State as a moral organism, because they attached a permanent 
stigma of inferiority to large sections of the community on the 
bare ground of birth and that the Hindu conceptions did not 
harmonize the authority of the State and the liberty of the 
individual It would be far beyond the scope of the present 
work to enter into any discussion of this problem All that 
may be said is that, Mr Anjaria tilts the balance to the other 
side too much. The faults he points out in the Hindu theory

led to kingship. Manu vTL 3 ( =SukranHiB5ra L 71 ) says ' the 
Creator created the king for the protection of all this world 
when everything tan through feat hither and thither, as there 
was then no ruler in the world *. It goes on to say that the 
Creator proceeded to create Danda ( the power of punishment ) 
for the Bake of the king and that if the king does not sedulously 
employ danda for punishing those that deserve it, the Btrong 
would tomient the weak as fish are fried on a pike or as in 
water fish devour each other { Manu V3X 14 and 20, the last also 
showing a variant ' jale ' for ' sule ' ). This idea of matsi/tmySya 
( the maxim of the larger fish devouring the smaller ones or the 
strong despoiling the weak) is fretjuently dwelt upon by 
Kautilya, the Mahabharata and other works. It can he traced 
back to the Satapalha-brahmana XL 1. 6. 24 ' whenever there is 
drought, then the stronger Beiees upon the weaker, for the 
waters are the law ', which appears to mean that when there is 
no rain, the reign of law comes to an end and malsyanyaw 
< begins to operate. Eautilya says ' if danda be not employed, 
it gives rise to the condition .of muteuanySya, since in the' 
absence of a chastiser the strong devour the weak ' and ' the 
people overwhelmed by the operation of miitsyanyaya made 
Manu Vaivasvata their king. ' « That in the absence of a king 
(arSjaka) or when there is no fear of punishment, the condi- 
tion of matsyanyaw follows is declared by several works such as 
the BSmayana H. chap. 67, Santiparva 15. 30 and 67 16 
KSmandaka H. 40„ Matsyapurana 225. 9, M&nasollasa £ 20 
verse 1295. Humerous works contain eulogies of danda. The 
tang a called dandadhara in many works e. g. in Santiparva 67 16

derived by the wise from the root ' dam ' ( to control ), that he

22 History of Dliarmaiastra [ Vol. 

225. 17, AgnipurSna 226. 16 and Santiparva 15 8 state that danda 
is so called because it suppresses those that are not restrained 
( from the root ' dam ' ) and punishes those that are imprudent 
or ungentlemanlike ( from the root ' dand ' ). Danda is raised to 
the position of a divinity by Manu " VIL 25 ( = Visnudharma. 
sutra Id 95 = Matsya 225 8 ), Yaj I 354, Santi 121. 15. Danda 
rules over all people, it protects all of them, danda is awake 
even when ( the guardians of law ) have gone to sleep, the wise 
regard danda as dharma ( Manu VJL 18= Santi 15. 2 = Matsya 
225 14-15 ). The whole world is under the heel of danda, for 
it is difficult to find a man who is pure by nature ( Manu 
VIL 22 = Santi 15. 34) The conception of danda is therefore 
this that the State's will and coercive power keep the indivi- 
dual and nation within the bounds of dharma, punish for 
breaches and effect the good of the whole The gods, danavat- 
gandharros, the raksasas and reptiles — these also tend to 
bring about enjoyment for men because they are pressed down 
by danda (Manu VIL 23) " The Bhagavadgfta (X 38) 
identifies danda with the divine Ersna 'I am danda in the 
hands of those who control others, I am nHt ( i. e. rSjanlti) for 
the conquerors '. For the detailed effects and long eulogies of 
danda, vide Manu VJ1 14-31, Matsya 225. 4-17, Kamandaka 
JL 38-44. These eulogies of danda presuppose the theory that 
people obey law and the dictates of the sastra through the fear 
of force or punishment Danda should be neither too severe nor 
too mild, but should be appropriate to the fault committed 
(Kaut L4, Kamandaka H 37, Manu VIL 16, Santi 15. Iff, 
Santi 56 21, 103 34 ) Santi 57. 41 advises that one should first 
secure a king, then wife and then wealth, for in the absence of 
the ruler there would be no wife nor private property TniB 
shows that the institutions of family and private property and 
the protection of the weak are bound up with fhc .existence of a

protector of the helpless, the home of the homeless, the son of the 
sonless and the father of the fatherless 

In order to magnify the importance of the kingly office, 
certain works state that the king has in him parts of the gods. 
For example, Manu says " the Creator created the king with, the 
essential parts taken from Indra, the Wind god, Yama, the Sun, 
Agni, Varuna, the Moon and Kubera the lord of wealth and 
therefore he surpasses all heings by his majesty ( VII. 4-5 and 
compare Manu V. 96 ) ; one should not disrespect a hoy-king 
with the thought ' he is a human being ( like others )' for it is a 
great deity that stands ( before people ) in human form as a king " 
(Manu VH. 8=Santi 68. 40). This conception goes hack toGautama 
XL 32 ( ' Therefore a king and a spiritual teacher must not be 
reviled * ) and Sp. Dh. S. I 11. 31. 5 ( ' he shall not speak harsh 
or abusive words of the gods or of the king '). Manu VH. 3-4 are 
the same as Sukranltisara 1 71-72. The Matsyapurana 226. 1 
states that the king was created by Brahma by taking portions of 
gods for wielding the power of punishment for the protection of 
all beings. Manu ( 3X 303-311 ) puts forward a slightly diluted 
theory, viz. the king should possess the majesty of and imitate 
in Ms actions the first seven deities enumerated above with the 
Earth as the 8th and Manu sets out what the eight characteristic 
actions are. Matsya 226. 9-12 are the same as Manu IX 303-306 
The Agnipurana( 226. 17-20) states that as the king exercises 
the functions of nine deities viz. the Sun, the Moon, Vayu Yama 
Varuna, Fire, Kubera, the Earth and Visnu he has the form of 
these. Vide Sukranltisara L 73-79 for similar ideas These 
verses do not amount to the express theory of divine origin 
but assimilate by analogy the king's functions to those of 
certain deities. The Narada-smrti (praklrnaka section 
verses 30-31 ) contains « several interesting dicta. It says that 

If? T °^w km ^ ifc fa reall y Jn ^ himself who moves 
about on the earth (v. 20), that a king even when devoid of 
qualities deserves honour from the people, that kings exercise 
the functions of five deities vis, of Agni, Indr a, Som! Yama 



24 History qf DMrmaiaslra [ Vol. 

and Kubera ( w. 26-31 ). The Markandeyapurana ( 37. 21-26 ) 
mentions the same five deities. ' The Veda says that when a 
king is chosen it is Indra himself that is chosen ; one desirous 
of prosperity should honour the king just as one worships 
Indra' — says Santi 67 4 Santi 69 states that all the gods are 
invisible, but the king is a deity that can be seen. The Vayu- 
purSna (57. 72) remarks a that in all past and future 
manvantaras universal emperors ( cakramrtvn ) are born on the 
earth with parts of Visnu. The MatsyapurSna (226. 1-12) 
mixes up the theory of the creation of the king from parts of 
the gods with the lesser idea of his functions being similar to 
those of certain deities The Bhagavata-purana ( IV. 14. 26-27 ) 
states that Visnu, Brahma, Siva, Indra, Vayu, Varuna — these 
and other gods — exist in the body of the king and that the king 
is full of ( the parts of ) all gods. It is to strengthen this con- 
ception that ancient ksatriya dynasties and their panegyrists 
tried to trace for those dynasties descent from the Sun or the 
Moon and in later times from Fire The practice of addressing 
the king as ' deva ' in Sanskrit dramas is due to the same 
tendency of the glorification of the royal office Asoka was 
styled 'devanam priya' (beloved of the gods) and Kushana 
emperoiB like Kaniska and Huviska styled themselves Devaputra 
( E L vol L pp 371 at pp 381 and 386 ) This phenomenon is 
not confined to India Alexander the Great and Julius C»sar 
had their descent traced to gods and goddesses Alexander was 
deified during his life-time in 324 B C by the Greek world 
(vide Cambridge Ancient History, vol. VI p 433) and Caesar's 
image was carried among those of the immortal gods Kautilya 
(1 13) makes a spy say among pauras and janapadas 'kings 
are (in) the place of (perform the functions of) Indra and 
Yama, since they visibly inflict punishment and bestow favours 
Even divine punishment affects those who despise them ( kings ). 
Therefore kings should not be despised' Hence it must he 
said that the conception of the divine nature of the kingly 
office'waB well-known in Kautilya's days and he was not above 
recommending the employment of this ^^f^ '^

is well-known and may be interpreted in two ways vis;, the 
Tuler of the earth is Visnu incarnated as man or no king is not 
Visnu i. e. every king is "Visnu. The Pancatanlra*' (1. 120 p. 19) 
states ' Manu has declared that the king is made up ( of parts ) of 
all gods '. The Eajanltiprakasa is caieful to point out that the 
idea of the king having in him parts of the deities applied only 
to the maharaja ( the sovereign ruler ), while the idea of a ruler 
doing the functions of five deities applies to vassal kings. ie 
For eulogy of the kingly office, vide Manu "VTL 6-17, Santi 
63. 24-30, Santi 68, Kara. L 9-11, Rajanltiprakasa pp. 17-31. 

But it should not be supposed that this glorification of the 
king resulted in the full-fledged theory of the divine right of 
kings or that every king, however bad, was looked upon as a 
divinity or could do what he liked. In the fust place, the Kaja- 
nitiratnakara *' ( p. 83 ) when, speaking of the coronation of a 
prince by his abdicating royal father quotes a verse where the 
people ( prafl ) themselves are called Visnu. In the second place 
the king's authority over brahmanas was limited ( vide H. Dh> 
vol. IL part 1 pp. 139-140 ). ,The Gautama-dharmasutra ( XL 1, 7 
and 8 ) says n ' the king rules over all, except over brahmanas; 
all, except brahmanas, should while sitting low on the ground 
wait upon ( worship ) him ( the king ) who occupies a high seat ; 
they ( the brahmanas ) too should honour him \ Prom the time 
of the Ait Br. ( 37. 5 ) the harmony between the king and the 
brahmanas and the king's following the advice of brahmanas 
had been insisted upon. Vide Ait. Br. 40. 1, Gaut. VHL It 
XL 27. Further the Sukranltisara (L 70) states that a king 
who oppresses the subjects and causes loss of dharma is made 
up of the parts of ra ksasas. » Manu ( YIL 111-112 ) states that

the king who harasses his subjects loses ids life, family and 
kingdom Moreover stories of kings killed for their tyranny 
are found in the ancient Literature. For example, Vena, who 
was jealous of the gods, wanted sacrificial offerings to be 
made to himself ( and not to the gods ) and violated dharma, 
was killed by the brahnianas ( Santiparva 59 93-95, Bhagavata- 
purana IV*. U ) The Anusasanaparva M ( 61 32-33 ) solemnly 
sanctions the killing of a king in certain circumstances " The 
people should gird themselves up and kill a cruel king who does 
not protect his subjects, who extracts taxes and simply robs 
them of their wealth, who gives no lead Such a king is Kaff- 
( evil and strife ) incarnate That king who after declaring ' I 
shall protect you ' does not protect his subjects should be killed 
( by the people ) after forming a confederacy, like a dog that is 
afflicted with madneiss ". Manu ( VIL 27-28 ) states that the 
great principle of dan$a if properly wielded conduces to the 
advancement of the three puiusarthas, but if a voluptuous, mean 
and unjust king wields it, it recoils on his head and destroys the 
king together With his relations Earn 2. 38 makes it clear that 
danda foolishly wielded might exasperate even hermits The 
Santiparva 92 19 recommends that a king who has false and 
very wicked ministers and who puts down dharma should be 
killed by the people Even as early as the Tai S XL 3 1 it 
appears that kings weie driven away, while the Satapatha 
Brahmana ( XEL 9 3. 1 and 3 ) mentions a king Dustarltu 
Paumsayana who had been expelled fiom the kingdom which 
had descended to him through ten ancestors The Sautramani 
i4fe is prescribed as a rite for a king to regain a kingdom from 
which he had been driven away { vide H Dh vol H. p 1337 > 
Santi 92. 6 and 9, Manu Vtt 37 and 34, Yaj I 356 appear to 
-justify at least deposing a king, if not tyrannicide Similarly, 
the Sukranltisara ( II 274-275 ) states * s that a king, though of a 
noble pedigree, should be abandoned, if he violates dharma, if 
he hates good qualities ( in others ), lines of policy and the army 
and if his conduct would lead to the destruction of the kingdom

officers of state should place on the throne another scion of the 
royal family who is possessed of tho requisite virtues. N&rada 
props up the theory of divine right by stating that the king 
secures dominion over ( lit. purchases ) his suhjecte by his 
austerities ( performed in former lives ) and therefore the king 
is their lord ( praklmaka 25 ), Sukranlti I. 20 also brings in 
the doctrine of Karma ' the king holds the earth by the actions 
of his former lives and by his austerities ' Compare Manu 
vTL 111-112, SSnti 78. 36. The Sukr&nltisara (IV. 7. 332-333) 
says that brahmanaB may even fight and destroy an oppressive 
ksatriya king and would thereby incur no sin. The Yasastilaka 
( III. p. 431 ) gives examples of kings killed by their subjects, 
one being aKalinga king who made a barber hi', commander-in- 
chief. In fact in all works on polity we find comparatively 
little about the king's rights and special privileges, but on the 
other hand the greatest emphasis is laid on tho king's duties 
and responsibilities. Some works describe the king as a servant 
of the people whose wages or remuneration for the protection 
he affords is the taxes he raises. Vide Baud. Dh. S. 1. 10. 1 
Sukranlti 1.188, Sferada (praklmaka 48), Santt 71. 10. 86 It 
may be said here that the apparently inconsistent dicta about 
the divinity of the king and about his being liable to be deposed 
or even killed for evil deeds are delivered from two different 
standpoints and are addressed to different persons. The writers 
believed in maintaining the status quo about the duties of 
varnas and Ssramas, in the privileges of the respective caster and 
m tne progressive deterioration of dharma in the ages to-come 
and wanted a strong king to preserve the social order ; therefore 
the kmg was raised to divinity and absolute obedience to his 
orders was demanded. This was addressed to the people in 
general There was danger however of bad kings and ministers 
oppressing the people by misrule. Hence the king and his 
ministers were threatened with destruction and death These 
dicta were principally meant for the king and his advisers. 

In the KautiHya V. 3 we meet with these words "In 
Rajasuya and other solemn ( or elaborate ) sacrifices the ' rSjlt ' 
gets three tames the salary given to others «ho are a-, learned as 
he is (samanavidyebhyafrtrig unavetano raja rajasuyadisu

kratuau ). Jayaswal ( in ' Hindu Polity ' part IT, p 136 ) seizes 
upon this passage to show that the king was a salaried person 
like the prime minister or the commander-in-chief' The words 
' in RajaBuya and other kratus ' should have raised douhts in his 
mind about his interpretation, hut he entirely missed the 
significance of the passage Kautilya in that passage is not 
referring to the king himself but to his representative or deputy 
when the king is engaged in numerous ceremonial duties during 
sacrifices of long duration like the Asvamedha The Ap 
Srautasutra (XX 3. 1-2), Baudhayana Srauta XV 4, Satyasadha 
Sr. XIV. 1 24-25 state that the adhiauju priest was to deputize 
for the king when the latter was engaged in the Asvamedha 3T 
( which was spread over a period of about two years ) The 
salary referred to by Kautilya is to be paid to the adhvaryu 
when representing the king Vide H Dh vol n p 1232 
for this. In X 3 it is said by Kautilya that a virtuous 
king on the eve of a battle should urge on his soldiers 
the fact 'lam a wage-earner like yourselves, this kingdom 
is to be enjoyed by me along with you You have to 
strike down the enemy pointed out by me " 18 Here the theory 
of the king being a wage-earner or a servant of the State is em- 
phasized in a striking manner. 

The word 'rajan' is derived in the Nirukta (IL 3) from the 
root * raj ' to shine, but the Mahabharata ( Santi 59. 125 ) likes to 
say that the king is styled 'raja' since he keeps all people 
contented, that is, it derives the word 'rajan' from the root 
•rani'. Great poets like Kalidssa (Raghu IV. 12) followthe 
Mahabharata in this, as also in deriving the word 'ksatriya' 
from * ksata' and the root 'trai\ meaning one who protects from 
wound and injury (Santi 59 126 and Eaghu-vamsalL 53) Br 
quoted in the Raja Dh K. (I p 5) appears to derive the word 
both from *raj * and *ranj' (balena caturangena yato ranjayati 
prajsh I dlpyamanah sa vapusa tena rajabhidhTyate).

jjj j Origin of kingship 29 

Atharvaveda VI 87 and 88. 1-2) has been taken a? an election 
hymn by some writers (e.g Jayaswal in 'Hindu polity* p. 7). 
But one is constrained to say that it h probably nothing of the 
kind The only words that may lend some colour to the theory 
of election are 'let all the people desire thee (as king)' in Rg- 
X. 173. 1, but those words may apply as a benediction even in 
the case of one who is already a king. In the Atharvaveda 
HI. 4 2 there" is a reference to the election of a king by the 
people 'the people (visah) chose thee to govern the kingdom, 
these quarters, the five goddesses ( chose thee ) *. In Atharvavoda 
TJT, 5, 6 and 7 also there is a faint allusion to the election of a 
king by nobles, king-makers, sutas and headmen of villages, by 
the clever makers of chariots and the skilled workers in metals. 
These 'king-makers 'are called 'Tatnins' in other Vedic texts 
and the Tai. Br. I. 7.3 states in connection with the twelve 
offerings in the Rajasuya called 'rttninam havlrhsi ' that the 
' ratnins ' give the ( rastra ) kingdom ( to the king ). Vide H. Dh. 
vol. 31. p. 1215 n 2648 and p. 1216 for the 'ratnins'. So it appears 
that the conception was that the king got the kingdom from 
nobles, high functionaries and the common people. For the 
coronation bath (and its implications) mentioned in the Ait. 
Br. vide note 105 below. The Ayodhyakanda (chap. 1 and 2) 
describes how Dasaratha when he grew old desired to make his 
eldest son Rama the Crown Prince (yuvaraja), how he called 
together an assembly of vassal kings, citizens and rural inhabi- 
tants andplacedbef ore the assembly his idea, how they acclaimed 
loudly the old emperor's proposal and readily gave their consent. 
This shows that though kingship became hereditary in course of 
time some element of popular approval was sought for. But 
such passages referring to the approval of the people cannot be 
stretched to mean tltat the king was chosen by a parliament the 
members of which were elected by the people. All that happened 
appears to have heen only this that citizens that approved 
assembled spontaneously and expressed their feelings in the 
assembly. In the Ramayapa II 67. 2 it is said that when Dasa- 
ratha died sages like Markandeya and Vamadeva declared along 
with the amStyas'm the presence of the family priest (purohita) 
Vasistha that as Rama and Laksmana had gone intoexile and 
Bharata and Satrughna were in the Kekaya country, some scion

crtfcens of the capital in one voice elected Janamejaya, though 
a boy, as a king on the death of Parlksit and Janamejaya ruled 
with the help of his ministers and purohita There are histo- 
rical examples of the eleotion of kings The ksaliapa Rudrada- 
man was elected king by the people of Surastra (who at one time 
formed a republic, ace to Kautilya XI 1) and he took an oath 
as stated in his Junagadh inscription in the year 72 (150 a D ) *° 
VideE I Vol. VJDIp 36 at p 40 Gopala, the founder of the 
Pala dynasty of Bengal (730-740 A D.), was elected a king 
(EI Vol IV. p. 243 at p 248 and Jayaswal's 'History of 
India,' 150-350 A. D. pp 44-45) It appears that it was the 
business of the chief ministers and brahmanas to propose some- 
body as king and such persons were called 'rajakartaTah*. In 
Ayodhya 67. 8 they say 'our country is without a ruler and may 
therefore encounter disastei'. Arajaka does not necessarily 
mean in Ayodhya 67 anarchy but a condition in which there is 
no king nor ruler. Though thiB is so, it is not possible to agree 
with Mr. K P. Jayaswal ('Hindu Polity*, part I, pp 97-98, 134, 
173) that 'arajaka' was 'an idealistic constitution, that it waB 
an extreme democracy almost Tolstoian in ideal, that it was 
based on a legal and communal basis, that it was a case of 
extreme individualism in which government itself was regarded 
as an evil * ' Ayodhya 67 8-31, Adi 41 27 ff , Santi 67 3 ff , 
Matsyapurana 225. 8-9 are the principal passages on arajaka. 
A perusal of these will convince any one not carried away by 
the over-patriotic desiie to find the latest European thought in 
our ancient books that arajaka was viewed as a state of chaos 
and the negation of any constitution; that when a country was 
without a ruler, no private property in anything existed or was 
respected and people preyed upon each other like fishes (Ayo- 
dhya 67 31 ) and that no Tolstoian ideals were present before 
the eyes of the writers that drew such a harrowing picture of a 
State without a ruler The famous Chinese traveller Hiouen 
Thsang notices (vide Baal's Buddhist Records of the Western

treacherously murdered by king Sasanka, the great minister 
Bhandin (who was also a cousin of Harsa) called an assembly 
of ministers and made to the young Harsavardhana a proposal 
to assume the royal authority, which proposal was backed up by 
all the ministers and magistrates, that thereupon Harsa agreed 
to become king after consulting the oracle of Avalokitesvara 
Bodhisattva. After the death of Paramesvaravarman II ( of the 
Pallava dynasty), when the Pallava kingdom was subject to 
anarchy, the subjects chose a king. For the details of this elec- 
tion, vide the important constitutional document of the Vai- 
kuntha Perumal temple (Dr. C. Minakshi's 'Administration and 
Social life under the Pallavas', 1938, p. 38). The Eajataranginl 
narrates (V. 461-463) that Yasaskara who was originally a 
poor man was chosen as king by the brahmanas. 

In some other places a theory somewhat like the theory of 
social contract expounded by Bousseau is adumbrated. The 
theory of social contract is presented in modern times under 
two forms. In one there is supposed to be a tacit or explicit 
agreement between the Government and the people. In the 2nd 
form it is supposed that a political society was constituted by a 
compact among individuals (to which the ruler was not a party). 
This theory puts forward the notion that government depended 
on the consent of the people. Kautilya (L 13) refers to the 
legend that Manu Vaivasvata was made a king by the people 
who agreed to assign one-sixth of the grain raised by them as 
the tangs share in return for the protection afforded by him. 
ButKautrtyaissilentasto whether Manu made any promise 
to the people. Santiparva, chap. 59, states how Vainya, the 
first kmg was called upon by the gods and sages to take an oath 
and how he promised them that he wouldprotect the world, and 
would carry out his duties as laid down in the science of govern- 
ment and not act at his sweet will." When this theory of an 
agreement between the king who took an oath and th7people 
TOd among the people, the theory of the divine right of kins* 
if ever seriously held, would recede more and mo7e fnto £

kings and for Buddhist theories of government. It is not possi- 
ble to hold as Jayaswal, U. Ghosal and others do (e. g. 'Manu 
and Yajfiavalkya ' H, * Hindu Polity * part H pp 54-57 ) that the 
theory of social contract was the earlier one and that the theory 
of divine right of kings was later on propounded by the Manu- 
smrti to support the brShmana empire of Pusyamitra. Jaya- 
swal is wrong in saying (in 'Hindu Polity' part H p. 57) 'the 
theory of the MSnava was never approved or adopted by a single 
subsequent law-book'. It has been shown above that Narada 
and others espoused the same theory. Manu himself eulogises 
the supreme power of danda over the king himself (Manu "V3L 
28 ). He makes use of both the theories as occasion demands 

The germ of the theory of Divine Right of kings probably 
goes back even to the Bgveda. Rg 3V. 42 is a hymn of king 
Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa. Some of the ideas therein are 
startling enough. He says 'the gods idly on the might of 
Varana, while I am the lord of the people (verse 1, kratum sacanie 
Varunasya food, i ajSm hrsiek &c) ; I am Indra and Varana, I am 
the wide and the deep Heaven and Earth, I am the son of Aditi 
(verses 3 and 4)'. Here there is an explicit claim by a king 
to be identical with the mightiest and greatest gods of the 
Vedic pantheon. In the Atharvaveda VL 87. 1-2 it is said about 
the king 'May all the people long for you, may not the kingdom 
be lost from your hands, may you stand firm in the world like 
Indra and may you uphold the kingdom' In the Satapatha 
Brahmana V. 1 5. 14 (when describing. the shooting of arrows 
intheVk]apeya)itissaid 'the rajanya is most manifestly of 
Prajapati, while being one he rules over many '. Here the posi- 
tion of the rajanya appears to be, regarded as due to his being

saciificer in the Bajasuya is identified with Indra and it is said

sacrifice." But passages like the last and Sat. Br V 1 3 4

and that then he would protect the people and then the gods 
made Dharma (i. e. danda) his friend. 

We may examine the theories of the origin of kingship in 
the Mahabharata. The S&ntiparva deals with this subject m 
two places, in chap. 59 and 67. In chap. 59 Yudbisttaa asks 
the great warrior and statesman Bhlsma how the title kmg 
arose and how one man, who has fundamentally the same 
physical and mental equipment as other men, rules over all 
men. These are not really two questions hut only two aspects 
of the same question. Then Bhlsma starts by saying that there 
was originally a state of perfection {Krlayuga) in which there 
was no king, no kingdom, no punishment and no chastiser. 
Gradually moha ( delusion or aberration of mind) spread among 
people and then greed, Bexual deske and passions arose and 
the Vedas and dharma perished. The gods did not receive 
offerings and went to Brahma, who composed a vast treatise as 
stated above (p. 4 ) that dealt with the four goals of existence 
for the benefit of the world and that was the cream of learning. 
Then the gods went to Visnu and requested him to appoint ( as 
king) one who deserved to be the best among men. Visnu created 
a son from his mind called Virajas who did not want to be a 
king. Fifth in descent from Yirajas was Yena who destroyed 
dharma and bo the brahmanas killed him and from his right 
arm they churned Prthu, handsome, well-armed and proficient in 
the Vedas, Vedangas and Dandantti. Gods and sages asked him 
to follow settled dharma, to control his senses and to take an 
oath (set out above in note 41 ). He was crowned by the gods 
and sages for the protection of the people. Visnu himsBlf esta- 
blished him saying 'Oh king, no man will go contrary to your 
order ' and then Visnu entered the king Prthu (verse 128) and 
it is therefore that this world since then bows to kings as to 
gods. In this account the oath administered to Prthu was so 
administered by the gods and sages and not by the people in the 
mass, nor does Prthu expressly promise anything to the people 
as such, Probably it was thought that the promise to the sages 
was impliedly a promise to the people in general. But the 
account, Buch as it is, rather appears to emphasize the divine 
origin of kingship.

34 History of Dharmaiastra [ Vol 

Chap 67 contains a much shorter version of the origin of 
kingship, probably because a few chapters before another vers- 
ion has already been given or because it embodies the views of 
some prior work or teacher. It begins by saying that the most 
desirable thing for a State is to crown a king, that in a kingless 
country there is no dharma, no security of life nor of property, 
that therefore the gods appointed kings for protecting people 
Then it proceeds to say that the people assembled and made 
compacts (samayan) amongst themselves that whoever would 
commit libel or assault or adultery and break the compacts made 
by the people should be abandoned. All people went to Brahma 
and requested him to appoint a ruler whom they would all honour 
and who would protect them. Brahms appointed Manu for that 
purpose, but Manu did not at first like the idea, saying 'Govern- 
ment is a very difficult business among men who are always 
deceitful and I am afraid of the sinful acts of men '. The people 
asked him not to be afraid as the sins committed by men will 
affect the perpetrators (and not Manu) and that the people would 
give bim shares of produce (one-tenth of grain, one-fifth of 
cattle, one-fourth of their dharma &cj Manu then agreed, 
went round the world, terrorizing evil-doers and making them 
conform to dharma This story about "Manu and the people is 
alluded to by Kautilya {vide p. 31 above). Even here Manu 
promises nothing expressly, while the people agree to pay taxes 
and answer for their own sins. There is no doubt that some of 
the details in the two chapters are different. In chap 67 there 
is no reference to an original state of perfection nor to a vast 
work nor to any oath; so also in one it is Tainya who becomes 
the first king and in the other it is Manu. But the conception 
in both is mythological and the fundamental fact in both is the 
same God gives a king to the people in both, when they were 
without a king and degeneracy had set in. Though there is no 
offer to give a share in chap 59 yet it is to be inferred from the 
praltjaa of Vainya that every subsequent king was deemed to do 
the same It may be said that in chap 67 there is a blending 
of the theory of Divine Bight and of an original compact 
between king and people. In both, however, the emphasis is on 
the theory of the divine origin of kingship Santi 67. 4 states 
•one desirous of prosperity should honour the king as one 
honours Indra', while chap. 59. 139 asks 'what is the cause but 
the divine character (the king possesses) on account of which 
people remain under his control'? It must be said that in ootH 



HI] Origin of hingshp 35 

chapters of the Santiparva there is no proper theory of contract 
between king and people. 

The Nsiadasmrti as indicated above (pp. 23,27 and note 27 ) 
is a thorough-going advocate of the theory of divine right. It 
says (praklrnaka 20-22 ) ' It is Indra himself who moves about on 
the earth as king ; people can nowhere live after trarisgrossing 
his orders. Since the privilege of protection is his because of 
his supreme power ( majesty ) and on account of the fact that 
he is benign to all creatures, the settled rule is that whatever 
a king does in right. Just as the husband, though weak, must 
be Honoured by the wife, so a ruler though devoid of qualities 
must be honoured by his subjects'. Verse 25 inculcates the duty 
of obedience to the king. 

According to Mr. J. N. Figgis in his book * The divine right 
of kings' (1934) pp. 5-6, the theory of the Divine Right of kings 
in its completest form involved the following propositions: 
(I) monarchy is a divinely ordained institution ; (II) hereditary 
right is indefeasible i. e. the right acquired by birth and descend- 
ing by the law of primogeniture cannot be forfeited through any 
acts of usurpation, or by any incapacity of the heirs or by any 
act of deposition; (IH) kings are accountable to God alone, i e 
a limited monarchy is a contradiction in terms; (TV) 'non- 
resistance and passive obedience are enjoined by God i e in any 
circumstances resistance to the king is a sin and leads to 
damnation and that when the king issues a command directly 
contrary to God-slaw, the latter is to be obeyed and also all 
penalties attached to the breach of the king's law are to he 

im. and 17th centuries when in Europe theology and politics 
were rn close union. 

It is to be seen how far the ancient Hindu theorv acrenrt 
with this full-fledged theory of the divine rightTf kings 
As regards proposition I it has been shown above that the 
Manusmrt! the MaMbharata and other works held that the kin*

tne tfuddhist Jatakas where bad kings were killed by the 
people and others were elected in their place There is no doubt 
that obedience to the king is enjoined by Narada and others, 
but it is due to the king only so long as he does not swerve from 
the path of right and virtue. Narada« (praklrnaka verses 13 
and 32 } says ' on account of his majesty and sanctity a king 
and brahmana are not to be abused if they do not swerve from 
the right path; one should not treat with contempt or scold the 
king, one should abide by his order, since (the penalty of) death 
may follow from violating it ( king's order ) '. Here the duty of 
obedience is not based on the divine origin of kingship, but on 
the practical wordly ground that an offended king may punish 
with death Narada's dootrine does not lead to the requirement 
of absolute submission and non-resistance to a wicked king. 

It is impossible to hold that the theory of divine right was 
put forward as a counterblast to the theory of social contract. 
The theory of divine right would arise very naturally even in 
the oldest days, while the theory of social contract is the produot 
of a more advanced stage of political thought. The theory of 
divine light is not more absurd than the theory of social con- 
tract and was popularly held not only in India, but m many 
Christian countries, relying on passages in the Bible such as 
Daiuel 4 and Romans 13. 1-7. The theory of divine right was 
circumscribed in India by another theory from very ancient times 
The cry of the American colonists against England in the 18th 
century was that taxation and representation went hand m hand ; 
that of the ancient Hindu political and dharmasastra writers was 
that taxation and protection went hand in hand (seen 45).

part {that he takes as tax) should protect the subjects'. Yaj. I. 
337 states 'The king shares half of that evil which the sub- 
jects do when not protected by the king, since he takes taxes 
(from the people) 'and Yaj. I 334 lays down that a king who 
protects according to sastras receives the 6th part of the merit 
ipunya) of the subjects. Santiparva (57. 44-45) states 'One 
should abandon six persons like a leaking boat in the ocean viz. 
a teaober who does not explain, a priest who does not study the 
Veda, a king who does not protect &c.' SukTanlti 1. 121 affirms 
' the gods destroy a king wbo does not protect, a brahmana who 
does not perform austerities, a wealthy man who makes no gifts.' 
Vide Vasistha 1. 44-46, Gaut. XI 11, Visnu Dh S. 111. 28, Udyoga- 
parva 132. 12, Santi 67. 27 ( 4th part of punya ), Santi 24. 12 ( 4th 
part), Santi 72. 20, Asramavasi 3.40, Anusasana 61.34 and 36, 
Kam. H. 10 for the idea that the king receives a part (generally 
6th part) of the punya (and also sin) of the people. The king 
had to protect even forest hermits who paid no taxes, as he would 
share in their pumja**. VideEamayanaHI.6.14. Kalidasa echoes 
this in the Sakuntala II. 13 Sdiparva 213. 9 looks upon the king 
who takes the sixth part as tax and affords no protection as the 
arch-sinner in the world. Santi 71. 29 says that the spiritual merit 
that a king gathers by protection according to the sacred code 
yields rewards for him in heaven for ten thousand years. 

From the preceding pages it is clear that the following aTe 
put forward as the grounds on which the obligation to render 
obedience to the ruler is based : (1) the king has divinity in him, 
(2) the great utility of the ruler affording protection as regards 
life, liberty and property, (3) the fear of punishment (Manu VII. 
22), (4) a primeval contract between the ruler and the people, 
(5) the interdependence of the ruler and the people as parts of 
one organism (viz. the State ). Vide Medhatitbi on Manu IX 294 
for this last. 

Who should be king? There were several views on this 
point One meaning of the word 'rajan* is 'ksatriya'. Manu 
K VH. 1) states that be will declare rajadharmas and in the very 
next verse he employs the word 'ksatriya' and remarks that a 
Kaatriya w ho has undergone the upanayana scwhsfcara ( or abh^eka 
according to some commentators) should afford protection to all 
m his kingdom. Therefore a ksatriya is the most proper person

to be a king Some of the works such as the Kajadbanna-kaus- 
tubha, BajanlfciprakSsa, the ITCtimayukha, and Par. M. vol L 
pp. 449-451 refer to the discussion in the Pfirvamlmansa 
works on the topic of the Avesti sacrifice On Jaimini K 3. 3 
Sahara and Kumarila hold an elaborate discussion. The Vedio 
tests say ( ra)a rajasuyena yajeta' ('the BajasQya should be 
performed by a rajan*). Among the numerous constituents 
of that sacrifice there is an tqh called Avesti, with reference 
to which a vedic passage says 'if a brahmana performs avesti, 
he places the Shutt (offering) for Brhaspati in the middle, 
if a ksatriya performs it the offering to Indra is placed in the 
middle of the offerings &e.\ The purvapaksa (prima facie view) 
is that the word * rajan * applies to any one (whether a brahmana, 
a ksatriya or a vaisya ) who protects the people The stddh&nta 
(the established conclusion) is that in this text the word rajan 
means a ksatriya and that by the other passage about brah- 
manas &o. what is meant is that brahmanas and vaisyas may 
independently perform the Avesti sacrifice, but that only a 
ksatriya can perform the Avesti as part of the Bajasuya rites. 
Sahara makes the interesting remark that in the Andhra country 
the word 'rajan' is applied to a man of the ksatriya caste even 
though he does not pursue the occupation of protecting a country 
or a city; while KumSnla observes that persons of all the four 
varnas are seen as rulers of kingdoms." In the literature on 
dharmasSstra the word ' rajan • is understood in the sense of ' one 
who rules over or protects a country ' (i e the pfirvapaksa view 
in the Pfirvamlmansa) Tide Medhatithi on Manu "VIL 1. 
ApaT5rka <! (onYa] I 366) remarks "when he who is not a ksatriya 
performs the work of a ksatriya (i e becomes a king) he should 
do all this (that a ksatriya king has to do) since the maxim is 
'that by assuming the position or the work of a particular 
person or thing one receives what is due to that other' and the

duty of protecting the subjects arises from the fact of taking 
taxes from them. For everyone when giving wealth does so 
with reference to a purpose related to himself and there is no 
purpose except one's protection that is intended in rendering 
taxes. Hence it is established that whoever receives taxes must 
secure protection of the subjects". According to Kullukathe 
word 'rajan' means 'any person who is crowned king and pro- 
tects the country and capital* and is not used in the sense of ' a 
person of the ksatriya caste'. The Eajanltiratnakara (p. 2) 
after citing Kulluka and Kamadhenu states that many hold 
that 'rajan' means ' any one who takes upon himself the task of 
protecting the subjects'. The Rajanltiprakasa holds 4 ' a long 
discussion {pp. 10-15), states that the woTd 'rajan' may have 
three meanings viz. any one who protects people, a ksatriya in 
general or a ksatriya who is crowned and ultimately gives it 
as its opinion that the word 'rajan' i& applied in popular usage 
to any one, whether crowned as king or not, who is the ruler 
of a country. The VaijayantI on Visnu Dh. S. HL 44 explains 
rajfiam" as ' of ksatriyas' by following the Avesti maxim.

{ Boal's B R W. W. vol H p 272 ) 

It was almost a universal rule that a male alone was to be 
the ruler. Thoro appear to havo been stray exceptions. The 
Santiparva (33.43-4G) enjoins" upon a conqueror the duty to 
placo on tho throno of a conquered country the brother, son or 
grandson of the vanquished king and if no prince be available, 
then to crown oven tho daughter of the late king The Eaja- 
taranginl ( V 249 and VI 332 ) describes at great length the 
regime of tho notorious queens Sugandha ( 904-906 AD) and 
Didda ( 980-81 A D ) of Kashmn In India for many centuries 
there has been no Salic Law expressly declaring that daughters 
cannot inherit land, though on account of the general position 
of women, the requirements of disturbed times and military 
necessity women did not generally assume the role of sovereigns. 
In a coppor-plato grant from Ganjam (of about the 13th century) 
it is stated that when a certain king named Subhakara died his 
quoen ascended the throne and after her her daughter Dandl- 
mahadevl, who is styled *parama-bhattanka-mahaTajadhira]a- 
paramesvarl' ruled the earth for a long time ( E I vol VI p 133

the queen or were only the exaggerated effusions of a courtier,

HI ] Women as rulers 41 

it is clear that the widow and daughter of the last male ruler 
succeeded to the throne. The Baghuvamsa ( XIX, 55, 57 ) states 
that the widowed queen of king Agnivarna sat on the throne 
and carried on the government with the help of hereditary 
ministers. 

Apart from conquest and election in rare cases, monarchy was 
hereditaiy and generally descended by primogeniture. Thepassage 
from the Satapatha Brahmana (XIL 9.3, 1 and 3) mentioning the 
descent of kingship for ten generations in succession has already 
been referred to (p 26) Though succession was hereditary 
it was the general rule that the eldest son ascended the thione 
when the reigning monarch died or abdicated. The rights of the 
eldest son or daughter as against the younger son or daughter 
were very jealously guarded in the vedic age. It has already 
been shown how marrying before one's elder brother or sister 
was condemned in the vedic age and also in the times of the 
smrtis (H. Dh. II. pp. 546-549). Even the ftgvoda several 
times refers to jycasthya ( rights of seniority ) of Indra ( Rg. I 5. 6, 
M 50 3). TheTai S. E. 2.11.5 Btates that the gods agreed to 
treat Indra as the ' jyestha ' ( the eldeBt ) and Tai. S. H. *» 5, 2. 7 
refers to the ancient practice of giving all wealth ( of the father ) 
to the eldest son. The Ait. Br. 19.4 narrates the story that the 
gods did not accept India's position as the eldest and most 
exalted among them and that Indra then induced Brhaspati to 
perform the Dvadasaha sacrifice foi him, whereby he secured 
that position. The Nirukta IX 10 sets out the interesting story 
that Devapi and Santanu were two brothers, scions of the Kuru 
family, of whom Devapi was the eldest, but Santanu the younger 
one got himself crowned king and so Devapi practised austeri- 
ties The result was that there was a drought in Santanu's 
kingdom for 12 years. The brahmanas said to him 'You are 
guilty of having violated dharma in that passing over the eldest 
brother you got yourself crowned Therefore God does not send 
down ram Then Santanu desired to give the kingdom to Devapi 
who however said that he would be his purohita and make him 
perform a sacrifice. The Bgveda hymn X 98 was then composed

pass over an elder brother in marriage and other matters and 
doing so brought down the seiious displeasuie of the gods. Vide 
Brhad-devaQ VII. 156-157 and VJ3L 1-9 for the same story in 
a little greater detail, viz that Devapi suffeied from a skin 
disease, that when Devapi said to the subjects that he did not 
deserve the kingdom and that Santanu should be their king, the 
subjects crowned Santanu as king When Yayati desired to 
pass over his elder sons Yadu and otheis because they disobeyed 
him and wanted to make the younger Puru his successor the 
brahmanas and citizens protested ' How can the younger son 
secure the kingdom passing over the elder one 50 *? Arjuna 
\ipbraids Bhlmasena who got enraged against Tudhisthira 
' who would act against one's eldest brother that follows the path 
of dharma?' (Sabha 68 8). In the Ramayana 51 Dasaratha 
addresses Rama ( H. 3 40 ) ' you are born of my eldest queen, 
who is of the same class as myself ( i e of ksatriya blood)* and 
Vasistha- says to Rama ' Among all Iksvakus the eldest son 
becomes the king"; a younger brother is not crowned king 
when the elder exists' (II 110 36). The Ayodhyakanda in 
several places ( 8.23-24, 101.2 ) reiterates the idea that all the 
sons of a king do not succeed but only the eldest, although 
the other sons may be equally fit and endowed with qualities. 
Kautilya (I 17 ) B states that people esteem rulership going 
to the eldest except in the case of Borne calamity. Manu 
IX. 106 says that by the very birth of the eldest son, a man 
becomes free from the debt he owes to his pitrs and there- 
fore the eldeBt deserves to get everything from the father. The 
Rajadharma-k. (pp. 334-235) after quoting the Kalikapurana 
and the Ramayana lays down the following propositions: (1) the 
aurasa son of a king alone succeeds in preference to the eleven 
kinds of secondary sons (whether he is junior or senior in age); 
(2) if the son of a junior queen ( of the same caste ) is senior by 
birth, he succeeds in preference to the son of the senior queen,

*bo (son) is younger in age; (3) if two sons are bom to two 
lis aAJsame moment, the son of the senior oueeniB 
preferred; (4) if twins ate horn to the senior queen, the son who 
is born fast is to be preferred. 

If the eldest bod suffers from a physical or mental defect 
(such as blindness or lunacy) he is to be passed over and his 
younger brother becomes king (vide Manu IX. 201 for grounds 
of exclusion from inheritance). idiparva« 109. 25 states that 
Dhrtarastra because he was blind did not succeed to the kingdom. 
Yide also tfdyoga U7. 39. The Sukranltisara (I 343-344) 
states that if the eldest prince suffers from deafness, dumbness, 
blindness, leprosy or impotence he is unfit to role and thatin 
such a case hib younger brother or Bon should succeed. The 
Sukranltisara further points out that by dividing a kingdom 
among the eevetal princes no benefit results, but on the contrary 
the small parts would fall an easy prey to enemies; therefore 
when the eldest alone succeeds he should make his younger 
brothers provincial governore or superintendents ovot the trea- 
sury, horses &c. (L 346-348). The Bajadharmakaustubha lays 
down a few additional propositions: (1) even if the eldest does 
not succeed owing to some mental or physical defect, his son's 
right will remain intact and R. D K. quotes the words of the 
fisherman chief to Bhlsma in Mi 100. 93." The B&lambhattl 
on Yaj. 1 309 and Rsjanltiprakasa p 40 say the same. Another 
example is that of Ansuman who became king when his father 
AsamaSja was exiled from the state by Sagara for his misdeeds. 
(2) When a younger son is crowned king because the eldest is 
disqualified, then after the former's death his son succeeds and 
not the son of the disqualified eldest son who is born after the 
coronation of the younger (eg. Yudhisthira deserved the 
kingdom on P&ndu's death and not Duryodhana ). The Nltiva- 
kyamrta ( sec. 24 p. 249 ) lays down the order of succession in 
the case of kings as follows: the son, full brother, half-brother, 
uncle, a male of the same family, daughter's son, a stranger 
(who is either elected or who takes up the kingdom 5 ').

SometimeB a king selected a younger son to Bucceed him. 
There are famous historical examples. The great Gupta Emperor 
Samudragupta though a younger son was nominated by his 
father Chandragupta I to succeed and hy his brilliant and most 
successful career Samudragupta more than justified the choice. 
Vide the Allahabad Pillar Inscription verse 4 (Gupta Inscrip- 
tions p 6 ) Similarly Chandragupta II, though younger, was 
nominated hy his father Samudragupta to succeed himself, 
Yayati selected his youngest son Puru because he was devoted 
and obedient and the eldest and other sons disobeyed him Vide 
Adiparva chap 75 ff and above p 42 . The principle of 
hereditary succession was so strong that even a boy king was 
placed on the throne. Vide Raghu XVIII 39. 

In almost all workB on rajasSstia there is a disquisition on 
the qualities that a good king should possess Vide Kaut VI 1, 
Manu VII 33-44, Yaj I. 309-311 and 334, Sankha-Likhita 
quoted in B, D. I HI p 14 and RajanSti-prakasa p 116, 
Santi 57 12 ff. and 70, Ksm I. 21-22, IV 6-24, XV 31, M5na- 
sollasa H. 1 1-9 (p. 29 ), Sukra I 73-86, Vismtdhaimottara IL 3 
Only one or two passages can be set out here Yaj (I 309-311 
and 334) states 'a king should have great energy, should be 
generous, mindful of past (good or bad) turns done by others, 
dependent on those who are advanced ( m austerities, knowledge 
and experience), possessed of a disciplined mmd, endowed with 
an even temper (in good or bad luck), born of a noble family 
(on both sides), truthful, pure (in body and mind), prompt in 
action, of strong memory, not mean-minded, not harsh (in words 
or acts), observant of the rules of dliarma (as tovarnasand 
asramas), free from vices, talented, brave,' clever in concealing 
secrets (or ace. to Bharucbi and Apararka * clever in scenting 
the secrets of his enemies'), guarding the weak points of his 
state, well-taught as regards logic, the science of goyein- 
meat, the science of wealth and the three vedas He should be 
forbearing towards brahmanas, straightforward towards his 
friends, wrathful towards his enemies, and should be (kind) l*e 
a father towards his servants and subjects'. Manu Vll 32^ is 
very similar to Yaj I 334 The Mit says that the qualities 
specified in Yaj J. 309-311 are antaranga (inward or more essen- 
tial). The 2nd quality ' sthSla-Iaksa ' occurs also in the inscrip- 
tion of Rudradaman ( E. I vol. VHI. atp 44) From I 312 YSJ. 
states the batoranga qualities viz selection of ministers, P^ oh "f 
and sacrificial priests, gifts to worthy brShmanas, protection «c, 



m] Qualities required in a king 45 

Kautilya VI, 1 contains several lists of the king's qualities from 
several points of view. 3?irst, there is a list of qualities that 
make the king win the heart of the people ( or make him approa- 
chable ) viz. being of a noble family, godly, spirited, consulting 
the aged, virtuous, truthful, not failing in his promises, grateful, 
taking broad views (not pusillanimous), highly enthusiastic, 
not given to procrastination, powerful enough to control his 
feudatories, firm in mind, having a council of ministers of no 
mean calibre, desirous of self-discipline These aTe called ' abhi- 
gamika-gunas' which word occurs in the Palitana plates of 
DhaTasena H ( of Valabhi) in E.I vol. XI p 83 and in the Mfiliya 
plate of the same king ( Gupta Ins. pp. 164, 1G9 ). The Dasakumara- 
carita VHI appears to make a pointed reference to this list 
when it makes a character say that the king (there referred to ) 
has in him all the qualities beginning from good family (sarvai- 
vatma-sampad-abhijanat-prabhrti &c.) Then the intellectual 
qualities he should possess are: desire to loam, study, under- 
standing of what is studied and retaining it, reflection, discus- 
sion and devotion to the principles accepted after discussion. 
Almost the same qualities of the intellect ( rf/tt ) are mentioned by 
Kam. IV. 22. The word * sakyasamanta ' ( in Kaut. VL 1 ) occurs 
also in Agnipurana 239. 4. The qualities that are the different 
aspects of his enthusiasm ( or energy ) are : valour, non-enduranco 
(of the might of others), quickness (of action) and assiduity. The 
same occur in Kam. IV. 23. Then follows a long list of quali- 
ties that go to make up the personal endowment of the king 
( atmasampat ). Gaut. ( XL 2, 4-6 ) requires that the king should 
do what is right (ace. to sastras) and speak (or decide) rightly, 
should he pure (at heart and externally), should control his 
senses, be possessed of qualified servants and endowed with 
knowledge of the meanB of policy, should be even-handed towards 
all his subjects and look after their welfare. The long list of 
Sankha-Iikhita agrees more or less with those of Kautilya and 
Ysj. Santiparva 70 states that the king should possess 36 quali- 
ties, via. he should not speak bitterly, he should be godly, not 
wicked, not haughty, of agreeable address &o. Kam I 21-22 
mentions lis qualities that lead to the well-equipped personality 
of the king (atmasampat), viz. study of sastra (Dandamti) 
intellect, serenity, cleverness, boldness, power of comprehension.' 
energy, eloquence, firmness, capacity to endure the worries of 
adversities, majesty, purity, kindness, liberality, truthfulness, 
gratef ulness, noble family, character, self-restraint Then Kam. 
■m iv. 15-19 Bets out the qualities oalled ntmasampat, which 



46 History of fiharmaiastrw [ Vol. 

generally agree -with Kautflya's enumeration ( in VL 1 ). Ace 
to Kam. IV 24 liberality, truthfulness and valour aie the three 
greatest qualities in a king, who, when endowed with these, 
acquires all other qualities The ManasollSsa (HI 2-7) first 
enumerates 44 qualities such as truthfulness, spiritedness (which 
agree more or less with Kautilya's enumeration) and then states 
that the five most essential qualities in a king are truthfulness, 
valour, forbearance, liberality and capacity to appreciate the 
worth of others. The AgnipurSna (239. 2-5) enumerates 21 
qualities such as noble family, character &c In the Parasurama- 
pratapa 96 qualities are enumerated in the Rajavallabhakanda 
(Ms 239 of Visramabag collection II, folio 21b). The Sabhaparva 
5 107-109 and Eamayana II. 100 65-67 require the king to avoid 
14 faults viz. atheism, falsehood, hot temper, carelessness, pro- 
crastination, not seeing the wise, laziness, addiction to five 
pleasures of sense, considering state matters alone (without 
mantnns), taking counsel with those who do not know politics, 
not starting to do what is decided upon, not guarding secret 
royal policy, not practising auspicious acts, taking up under- 
takings on all sides at one and the same time. Vanaparva 251. 
5 says that subjects do not like a king who is very timid, very 
weak, procrastinating, careless and immersed in pleasures on 
account of vices. Sabha5 125 states that Bleep (by day), lazi- 
ness, timidity, hot temper, softness and dilatoriness aTe six 
calamities in a king 

The works on dharmasastra and aTtha&stra devote a good 
deal of 6pace to the education of the king and to his moral dis-' 
cipline. Gaut XL 3 requires that the king should have received 
instruction in Trayl ( the three Vedas ) and Anvlksikl This last 
has been differently interpreted by different writers. Kaut 1 2 
says that Anviksikl comprehends Sankhya, 57 Yoga and Loka -

yata and that it examines the relative strength of the three 
otheT wdyas with reasons, and thereby benefits the world, steadies 
the mind in calamities and prosperity and imparts excellence in 
intellect, speech and actions. It iB always the torch of ( sheds 
light on) all vidyas, it is the means of ( inducing to go in for ) 
all undertakings, it is the source of all dharmas. Kaulilya 
derives the name from the root ' Iks * with ' anu ' and he takes it 
to mean the science of ratiocination. It is somewhat strange that 
Lokayata is included in Anvlksikl, one of the subjects of study 
for the prince. But it appears from the remarks he makes that 
Kaut. uses it only in the sense of logic based on premises derived 
from ordinary experience (loka) though in later literature 
Lokayata came to mean' nastika* (atheist, materialist). Ace. s8 

( Continued ft am last page ) 
III. 3 S3 and 54 states that the Laukayatikas held the view that conscious* 
neas is a quality of the body ( and there is no soul over and above the body ), 
The Tantravartika runs them down as fools and apes (on Jaimini 1. 3. 3 ). 
In the Ramayana Rama asks Bharata not to resort to Lokayalika brahmanas, 
who, though childish, loolt upon themselves as learned and v,ho relying on 
the knowledge acquired by Snvlksikl speak nonsense in spite of the fact that 
there are principal Dharmasastras ( that point out the sensible path ). ^HilW

Sukranlti 1 158 it means 'Atmavidya* (Metaphysics), while 
Sukraniti 1. 153 and Rajanlti-prakasa p 118 combine the two by 
saying that it is logic that leads on to or is useful for acquiring 
knowledge of the Self. The Nltimayukha (p. 34) includes logic 
and VedSnta in Anvlksikl and MimansS and smrtis under 
Trayl The Barhaspatyasutra (JL 5-6 ) advises the king to follow 
the Laukayatika doctrines at the time of securing artha (wealth ) 
and the Kapalika-sSstra in achieving his sexual and similar 
desires M 

Great divergence of views prevailed as to the vidyas that 
were essential for the education of the king According to the 
Manusmrti VH 43, Santi 59 33, Kaut L 2, Taj L 311, Kam 3L 2, 
Sukranlti L 152, Agni. 238 8, the subjects for the king's education 
are four viz, Anvlksikl, Trayl, varte and Dandanlti. Kaut 
notes that the school of the Manavas held the view that the 
vidyas were three and regarded Anvlksikl as a special branch of 
Trayl ; that the Barbaspatya school was of opinion that they 
were only two, Varta and Dandanlti, since Trayl only acted as 
a screen (to obscure the intellect) of one (the king) who 
wants to know the ways of the world; and the Ausanasas regard- 
ed Dandanlti as the only vidya for a king, since according to 
them, the efforts to learn all vidyas are tied down to it (i e are 
ultimately intended to lead on to the mastery of Dandanlti ) It 
will be seen how the Ausanasas and Barhaspatyas had an 
entirely secular view in the science of government and divorced 
it from the study of sacred books and metaphysics in the case 
of the king The DasakumSracarita Vm (that displays a 
deep study of Kautilya) says that the vidyas for the king are four 
( catasro xajavidyas-traylvartanviksikldandanltih ) The Barhas- 
patyasutrsl 3 ( Dandanltireva vidya ) holds that Dandanlti is 
the only (essential) vidya for the king Kautilya further 
explains that dharma and its opposite are learnt from the three 
Vedas, viz Samaveda, Bgveda and Yajurveda, that the 
Atharvavedaandltihasaveda (i e Itihasa and Purana ) aretne 
other Vedas and that the six Angas also ( viz. phonetics, ritual, 
grammar, etymology, metrics and as tronomy) are eomprenen a-

•a In tiie mri 'Trayi"". Sukramti 1. 155 says that the 14 vidyfis 
( enumerated in Y&j. L 3 ) are comprehended in Trayl. Gaut 30. 
19 expressly says that in doing his duty of making the * people 
observe the rules of the sacred codes the king would have to 
rite on the Veda, DharmasSstras, the Angas, Upavedas and 
Parana. In the EamByana, Rama and his brothers are often 
spoken of as proficient in the Vedas, Vedangas, in D ha " u ™ da / 
GSndharvaveda, Eajavidyft &c. (1.18.24 and 26, U. 1.20 H 2. 
34-35 V 35. 13-14 ). In the VanapaTva 277. 4 it is said that tne 
princes were proficient in the Vedas with their secret doctrine 
and in Dhanorveda. In the Adiparva 221. 72-74 Abhimanyu is 
said to have learned from Arjuna before he became 16 the 
Dhanurveda in four sections, the knowledge of astias, and the 
theory and practice of these. Vide also Anusasana 104. 146-147. 
Kharavela in his Hathigumpha Inscription ( E. I vol. XX p. 79 
II. 2 and 5 ) states that he learnt Lekha ( official correspondence ), 
Eupa (currency), Ganana (Accountancy) and the admini- 
stration of justice, when he was the crown prince and also 
GSndharvaveda (music). In the Junagadh Inscription of 
Eudradaman ( E. L vol. VDI at page 44 ) the Mahaksatrapa is 
said to have attained great fame by his deep study, retention, 
and actual practice of grammar, artha ( either lexicography or 
politics ), music, logic and other vidyas and to have been a fine 
rider of horses, elephants, chariots and a great adept in wielding 
the sword and shield and in wrestling". The personal attain- 
ments of Samudragupta ( in Gupta Inscriptions No. 1 pp. 12, 
15-16 ) show how thorough the education of at least some princes 
was or at least what the ideal about their education was. Vide

Prasad's ' Theory of Government in Ancient India ' p. 218 for 
an ideal course of education for a prince quoted. from the 
Buddhist work, Sfitralankara of Asvaghosa. The Nitiv»kyamrta w 
adds a long list of the accomplishments which a prince should 
possess viz. all scripts, valuing of jewels, knowledge of arms 
&c. On reading the ideal courses prescribed for the education 
of the prince hy ancient Indian writers one cannot help feeling 
that they were probably actuated by the same sentiments that 
are attributed to Socrates by Plato in his 'Bepublie' (tr. by 
Jowett, ed. of 1875, vol. HI. p. 357 ) viz. 'Until philosophers are 
kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and 
power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet 
in one and these commoner natures who follow either to the exclu- 
sion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities will never 
cease from ill-no, nor the human race as I believe-and then only 
will our State have a possibility of light and behold the light of 
day &c ' The AgnipurSna (225. 1-4) prescribes that the prince 
should be taught dharmasastra, kamasastra, arthasSstra, science 
of archery ( dhanurveda ), the various arts and crafts by 
trusted teachers, that he should not be allowed to be associated 
with those who are angry with the king or disrespected by bim 
or who are greedy and that if it is impossible to impart good 
qualities to him he should be confined, surrounded by pleasures. 
The princes were sometimes educated in their own capital or 
in a nearby college. Vide H. Dh. vol. H. p 364. Sometimes, it 
appears, princes went to such famous seats of learning as 
Takaasila ( vide Jfitakas ed. by Fausboll H 87, 278, 319, 323, 400, 
JJI. 158, 168, 415, 463} The subjects of study there were the three 
vedas and 18 silpSni or vidyas ( Jatakas, vol. H. 87, HI. 115 ). 
Kautilya(L4) explains that Vfirfca is constituted by agricul- 
ture, the rearing of cattle and trade ; it benefits ( the State ) by 
bringing in grain, cattle, gold, baser metals, and free labour; by 
means of vSrtS the king secures treasury and army whereby he 
brings under control his own side and the enemy. In the 
Sabhaparva s « 5.79 and Ayodhyakanda 100 47 it is declared

that when the world relies on -vartfi it easily prospers. The 
Santi-parva ( 263. 3 ) gives the warning that this world would 
cease to exist if v&rta was givon up, that this world fo rooted 
in vSrta and is sustained by the throe vedas ( 68. 35 ). The 
Vanaparva (150.30) states that the wholo world is sustained 
by vSrtS i.e. by merchandise, mines, trade, agriculture and 
tending cows, she-goats and ewes. The STitivakyamrta { p. 93 ) 
after defining v&rta oo above emphasizes that the king secures 
the abundance of everything when varta is prosperous and that 
the man who has his own agriculture, milch-cattle, plot for 
growing vegetables and a well in his own house has indeed all 
the pleasures of this world. These quotations indicate what 
importance was attached to agriculture and the economic 
structure of society. The result is that in the ArtbasSBtra 
economic matters occupy a very large space. 

Kautilya (15) starts by saying that the three vidySs 
(except dandanlti) in the case of the prince depend upon danda, 
that danda in its turn is based upon discipline, which is of two 
kinds, natural and induced (or acquired). VidyaB produce 
discipline ( of the 2nd kind ) in him who possesses the qualities 
of intellect specified above. Then he goes on to say that the 
prince should learn the alphabet and arithmetic after his caula 
is performed ( in the 3rd year or later ) and after upanayam he 
should learn the three vedas and snvlksikl from the iisfas 
(those learned in the veda), vSrta from the heads or superin- 
tendents (of the various departments thereof) and dandanlti 
from expounders (of thetwfj/S) and from practical politicians. 
Vide Manu VTX 43 ( =Matsya &15. 54 and Agni 2X5. 21-22 ) for 
ofcectKmsasto from whom the prince was to learn the four 
JidySs Kautilya prescribes that- the prince should study 
these up to the 16th year, should then marry and that in order to 
foster the growth of the discipline of the intellect he should 
always associate with those who are advanced in the vidySs 
enumerated above (after his 16th year) and- that the king 
Jould spend the first part of the day in practising the riding of 
elephants horses chariots and in the science of arms and the

1. 19-20 ) extol the value and importance of wnaya, and waiting 
upon the aged and the learned Manu ( VII. 40-42 ) states that 
many kings perished with their vaBt paraphernalia through want 
of dincipline while others, though residing in a forest ( i. e 
without an army &c ), gained kingdoms through vinaya, and 
names Vena, Nahusa, Sudas son of Pijavana and Sumukha 
Nimi as tliose who perished through lack of vmatja and gives Prthu 
and Manu as examples of those who secured kingdoms through 
vinca/a. Matsya 215.53 is the same as Manu VIL 40. Ancient 
Indian writers harp on the education of the prince so much 
because their ideal of kingship was that the king should be a 
rajar$i ( a royal sage ) KalidaBa frequently speaks of this e g 
in Sakuntala JL 14 and Raghuvamsa (I 58) They were 
aware, like Socrates, that until either philosophers became" kings 
or king3 philosophers States will never succeed m remedying their 
short-comings ( vide p. 50 above ). Not only waB an extensive 
course of intellectual training prescribed for the king, but both 
dharmasastra and arthasastra workB strongly and frequently 
insist upon the necessity of moral discipline and the right direct- 
ion of the emotions and will in the case of the king. 

Kautilya {16) emphasizes that control of tho organs of 
sense is the cause of (proficiency in) vidy&s and discipline 
should be attempted by giving up the six enemical tendencies 
viz. lust, hot temper, greed, vanity (mana), haughtiness or 
insolence ( mada ), overpy. He says that ( tho whole purpose or 
insistence of ) all sastras is the restraint of the senses, that even 
a supreme ruler of the whole earth up to its four borders whose 
senses are not under control will at once periBh and cites two 
examples on each of these six tendencies, viz Dsndakya 
Bhoja who attempted to rape a brahtnana girl through lust ana 
perished with his kingdom and kinsmen and Karala king oi 
Videha; Janamejaya (perished) who attacked brahmanas 
through hot temper and Talajangha who did so against tne 
Bhrgus , Aila who exacted through greed excessive taxes from 
arsons of the four varnas and Ajabindu, the king of _ Sauvira ; 
Havana who did not restore another's wife through ms conceit 
and Duryodhana who did not give even a part from his kingdom, 
Dambhodbhava who despised all beings through his insolence ana

Arjuna of the Haihaya dynasty ; Vatfipi through overjoy when 
he attacked Agastya and also tho oligarchy of the Vrsnis when 
they attacked Dvaipayana* 5 . Tlieso »ix evil tendencies are 
called iatntrsa4-varga or an-sa$targa. Kautilya adds that by the 
conquest of these six evil tendencies Jamadagnya (Parasur&ma) 
and Ambarlsa enjoyed the earth for a longtime. Kam. (1 55- 
58) and Sukra. I. 144-146 give six of tho twelve examples of 
Kaut and Kam. J. 58 is the same as the last verse of Kautilya 
L 6. Vide Markandeya 27. 12-13. In tho Vasavadatta of 
Subandhu (Hall's ed pp. 273-276) there is a long list of the 
kings of antiquity (Pururavas, Nahusa, Yayati, Sudyumna, 
Nala and nine others) who suffered owing to some failing or 
other in themselves The Udyogaparva (74. 13-18 ) mentions by 
name 18 kings who by their evil career destroyed themselves, 
their friends and relatives (such as Mudavarta of the Haihayas, 
Janamejaya of the Nlpas, Bahula of Talajanghas, Dhautarmllaka 
of the Olnas). This shows that Clna does not probably stand for 
modern China in the epic. Manu VJI. 44 ( =Matsya 215. 55 ) also 
emphasizes the necessity for the king incessantly to curb the 
senses and not to fall a prey to vices arising from kama and hrodha. 
Mann (VH 45-48) enumerates ten vicious tendencies due to 
kama ( desire for pleasures) viz. hunting, gambling, sleep by day, 
finding fault (with others), women, drunkenness, (excessive 
indulgence in) dancing, singing and instrumental music, and 
aimless wandering; and eight vicious tendencies duetokrodha 
(hot temper) viz. tale-bearing, violence, treachery, envy, slander, 
(improper) seizure of property, reviling and assault. Manu 
further declares (VH. 50) that among the vices due to kama, 
drinking wine, gambling, women and hunting are the most 
harmful, each preceding one being worse than each succeeding

one and ( VII 52 ) that among the vices due to hot temper, caus- 
ing physical injury, reviling and deprivation of wealth are the 
worst. Manu ( VIL 52) has a sly hit that these seven vices are 
more or less prevalent among kings {sanatraaMnitsangvnah) and 
therefore the only choice is that of the lesser or least of evils 
Kautilya ( VHL 3) has a lengthy disquisition on the views of his 
predecessors about the relative harmfulness of the three vices 
due to hot temper and of the four due to Kama and states his own 
opinion that arthadusava meaning loss of the means of livelihood 
by gifts, exactions (by the king), loss or abandonment of pro- 
perty is more harmful than reviling and dandaparusya is more 
harmful than arthadusana He points out the benefits derived 
from hunting viz exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile, 
fat and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and 
moving bodies, the ascertainment of the minds of beasts when 
they are provoked and occasional travel H These are echoed, 
almost in the same words by Kam 23V 25 and in the Sakuntala 
(H. 25 ) by Kalidasa Vide Sabha 68 20, Udyoga 33 92 for the 
seven principal vices Kam (XIV. 6 and 7) enumerates the 
three vices of hot temper and the four of Varna and holds an 
elaborate discussion on their respective demerits He defines 
arthadusana (XIV. 17) somewhat differently ( viz as the aban- 
doning of an important object or of great wealth in order to show 
that what really merits blame is not so ) Vide the Visnudharmot- 
taraIL65 12-15 for the two meanings of arthadusana 67 . Earn does 
not agree that hunting has many good points in its favour and 
advises the king to prepare a separate well-guarded hunting 
ground of one-half yojana in length and breadth if he really 
deBires to hunt (XIV. 28-42) The~ManasollSsa (vol E) in 
the 15th chapter of the 4th vimsati deals with hunting as a sport 
for kings and points out how a forest is to be preserved for 
royal hunting and how it is to be guarded and enumerates 31 
methods of hunting. Kam warns the king who wants to retain

Us kingdom against fondness for women (XIV. 57-58). He 
farther says that a king may even indulge in fondness for 
women and may even drink moderately, but he must totally 
avoid gambling and hunting (XIV. 65). Kautilya regards 
gambling as the worst of the vices for a king (VUL 3 last 
sentence In prose). IntheDasafcumaracarita (VIII) there is an 
elaborate (but ironical) description of the mental and other 
benefits derived from the four principal vices due to kama. 
Earn. L 54 states that hunting, gambling and wine in the case 
of kings must be condemned, since calamities befell Pandu, Nala 
and the Vrsnis (respectively ) by being addicted to these. Even 
an ideal king like Rsma vras fond of hunting. Sukra (L 332-333) 
points oat that hunting has much in its favour, but there is one 
great defect in it viz. slaughter of animals. Sukra ( L 109-119 ) 
denounces gambling, drinking and fondness for women as the 
worst of vices and points out that Indra, Dandakya, Nahusa and 
Havana came to grief through their passion for womeji ( 1 114 ) 
and that a king who is excessively fond of dancers, singers, 
courtesans, wrestlers, eunuchs and men of low birth falls an 
easy prey to his enemies ( L 128 ). Kam. ( L 40-46, which are 
almost the same as Sukra L 102-107 ) gives a poetic description 
of how animals like the deer, the elephant, the moth, the fish 
and the bee meet death or become confined by extreme attach- 
ment to one only out of the five objects of sense and emphasizes 
that man who can and does enjoy all the pleasures of the five 
senses must practise great restraint 



CHAPTER III 

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF 
THE RULER. 

All works are agreed that the first and foremost duty of 
the king is the protection of subjects Santiparva (68 1-4) 
notes that all the seven expounders of polity ( rajasastraprane- 
t&rah ) named by it extol protection as the highest dharma of 
the king Manu VH. 144 states that the protection of subjects 
is the highest dharma and Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa 1467 
alludes to this dictum of Manu. Protection consists in punishing 
internal aggression (such as by thieves and robbers and by 
persons who invade a man's rights) and in meeting external" 
aggression Vide quotation from Brhaspati below Gautama 
( X. 7-8 ) prescribes that the special responsibility of the king 
is to protect all beings, to award just punishment and that he 
has to protect the several varnas and Ssramas according to the rules 
of sastra and to bring them round to the path of their proper 
duties when they swerve from it (XL 9-10) Vasistha ( 19 1-2 ) 
states that the wise say that protection is a life-long sattra in 
which he has to give up fear and softness of heart. Vas 19 7-8 
and Visnu Dh S HI 2-3 are similar to Gaut XL 9-10 The 
Santiparva ( 23 15 ) repeats a gathu of Brhaspati ' As a snake 
swallows mice lying in holes, so the earth swallows these two 
viz a king who does not fight ( an invader ) and a brshmana 
who does not go on a journey ( for acquiring knowledge from 
famous teachers ) S8 " Manu IX 306 states that the king pro- 
tecting his subjects according to the sastra and meting out 
punishment to those who deserve it performs every day sacrifices 
in which the fees are one hundred thousand cows (i e he 
secures the spiritual reward of very solemn sacrifices) Taj 1 335 
is to the same effect Kautilya also lays emphasis on the duty 
to keep the varnas and asramas to their duties ' Therefore the

king should not allow the people to swcrvo from their duliV. 
He, who keeps dharma intact ( without breach ), enjoys bliss 
in this world and the next*. Nftrada* 9 ( praklrnaka 33 ) states 
' His duty is to protect the subjects, to ( honour or } listen to the 
aged and the wise, to look into the disputes of people arid to be 
energetic in his functions as king '. Sukra ( 1. 14 ) cays that 
the highest dharma of the king is to protect the subjects and to 
put down the wicked. According to Atri ( verse 28 ), 70 to punish 
the wicked, to honour the good, to increase the treasury in the 
right way, to deal impartially with litigants and to protect 
the kingdom— these five aTe declared to be sacrifices in the 
case of kings. The Visrmdharmottara ( HI, 323. 25-26 ) refers 
to the five sacrifices in very similar words. In Santi 77. 33 the 
king's duty to restrain brahmanas from engaging in unworthy 
actions is specially emphasized. These passages establish that 
the principal duties of the king were conceived to be to protect 
the subjects, to see that the rules of varna3 and asrarnas were 
carried out by them, to punish the wicked and to do justice. 

The duty to protect involved fighting and probable death- 
Therefore the ancient works on dharma-sastra always insist that 
it is the duty of the ksatriya to fight and that death on the 
battlefield is to be his highest ideal. Manu ( VII 87-89 ) enjoins 
upon the king, when protecting his subjects against invasion, not 
to run away from battle and promises heaven as the reward 
for kings who die fighting in battle Yaj I 324 holds forth the 
same reward for all soldiers who are killed in battle. Vide 
Striparva 2 16 and 18 and 11. 8-9. The Bhagavadglta ( IL 31-37 ) 
most solemnly declares that there is nothing higher for a 
ksatriya than a righteous war, that a- ksatriya's duty requires 
him not to quail in battle, that if he dies in battle he goes to 
heaven and if he survives he rules over the world, that he should 
fight as a duty without caring for gain or loss, victory or defeat 
and if he fights with this attitude no sin attaches to him Santi 
parva 78 31 states that just as those who join in the bath of the 
King at the end of the Asvam edha are purified of all sins, so all

Parasara 71 HL 37 says "Two men pierce the orb of the sun (i e. 

reach heavenly worlds) viz an ascetic endowed with Yoga and 

a 3oldier killed while facing the enemy " and the following verses 

(HL 38ff ) dilate upon how the slain warrior is waited upon in 

heaven by divine damsels A verse of the Rgveda X 154 3 

( = Atharva 18 2 17 ) appears to hold that warriors losing life 

in battle reap the same rewards that those who make gifts of a 

thousand cows in sacrifices secure n It is probably this passage 

which Kautilya has in mind when in X. 3 he refers to the Veda 

for inciting the soldiers to fight without regard t6 Hfe Ap Db, 

S. (IL 10 26 2-3 ) states that a king, who strives to recover the 

wealth of brahmanas (stolen by thieves) and dies in the effort, 

is said to perform a sacrifice, in which his body is the sacrificial 

post and the fees are incalculable and that other valiant men 

losing life in fighting for a (good) cause are in a similar position 

To die fighting for the protection of cows and brahmanas is 

specially commended (vide Santi 21. 19 and 77. 28 and 30) The 

Visnudharmasutra DX 44-46 prescribes 'there is no duty for 

kings equal to losing one's life in battle; those who meet death 

in protecting a cow, a brahmana, a king, a friend, their own 

wealth and their wife enter heaven as also those who meet death 

in preventing confusion of varna3 (caused by adultery &c) ' 

On the eve of battle the great warrior Bhlsma says to his officers 

'it i3 a sinful act for a ksatriya to die in his house from some 

disease; the ancient code of conduct for him is that he should 

meet death from steel' ( Bhlsmaparva 17 11) The same idea is 

presented in Salyaparva 5 32, Santi 97 23 and 25 

Kamandaka 7 * (V. 82-83) makes it clear that the subjects 
require protection against the king's officers, thieves, enemies of 
the king, royal favourites (like the queen and the princes) and

rather modern in tone In many modern countries the State

of its subjects, not only armed forces and the police, but social 
•services such as education, public health, medical attendance, 
insurance against unemployment, old age, widowhood, and 
orphanage, lelief of poverty &o In ancient India, though there 
weie naturally no Acts of Parliament guaranteeing the above 
bervices to the subjects, public opinion, the views of eminent 
writers and the practice of the best kings created an atmosphere 
in which it was thought that it was imperative for the king 
representing the State and. its resources to encourage learning, to 
care for the blind, the deciepit, the old and the widowed and to give 
employment to those who weie unemployed Asoka constructed 
hospitals for men and animals (2nd Rock Edict at Kalsiin 
C II vol 1, p 28), alms-houseg, rest houses, watering places, 
shady trees on the highways and inigation works, visited and 
supported the aged (8th Girnar Rock Edict in C I I p 15). In 
the 2nd century B Kharavela, emperor of Kalinga, declares in 
his Hathigumpha Inscription (E I vol. XX p 71atp 86) that 
in the very first year of his reign he constructed embankments 
round the Ehiblra lake m the Kalinga capital and renovated all 
public gardens Rudradaman in the 2nd century A. D repaired 
the Sudarsana lake at great cost from his own treasury without 
levying fresh taxes or benevolences (pranaya) or forced labour 
The Anusasanaparva says that good kings should TO construct

brahmanas The Matsyapurana 215. 64 remarks that the king 
should give to those who stay m hermitages food, oil and pots 
Vide Ap. Dh S IL 2 4, 21 and Haradatta thereon as to provision 
for sudra guests. It is quite possible that these rules of the tests 
were not literally followed by all kings, but it is well-known

the three Vedas and endowed with wisdom and to abide by their 
direotions. Vas. I, 39—11, Gattt, XI. 13-1-t say the same. In

subjects constitutes his good'. Similar words occur in the

his coronation corresponds to the bath of the person who is 
consecrated for a sacrifice Santiparva M ( 56. 44 and 4G ) and 
Nltiprakusika VHI 2 declare that a king like a pregnant woman 
should not do what is pleasing to him, but what would conduce to 
the good of the people and the ancient dharma for a king is to 
keep tho subjects contented. In Santi 90 1 and 5 it is said ' the 
king is there for tho upholding of dharma and not for acting as he 
likes and that all beings have to depend on dharma which in its 
turn depends on the king '. In Udyogaparva 118. 13-14 a king 
exclaims * the wealth I possess is for the benefit of the urban and 
rural population and not for my own enjoyment ; for, that king 
who at his sweet will gives away what ( really is not his but ) 
belongs to others doos not bocomo endowed with spiritual merit 
nor with fame '. King Marutta is warned by his grand-mother 
in the Markandeya 8 * (130. 33-34) that the king's body is not 
meant for pleasures but for undergoing great trouble in protec- 
ting the eaTth and carrying out his duties Ancient writers 
loved to dwell upon the rule of the king as paternal. Jlaut. 
II 1 states that tho king should favour like a father those who 
are outside the rules for remission of taxes Yaj 7. 334 requires 
the king to be like a father to his subjects and servants Vide 
Santi 139. 104-105 for the same idea. * s In the RamSyana JDL3. 
28-47 and V 35. 9-14 the virtues of the prince Rama are 
Bet out in great detail, where it is said that Rama behaved like 
a father ( IL 2 39 ), that he sympathized with the people in 
their sorrows and was pleased like a father when the subjects 
celebrated festivals The Ramayana u HI 6 11 declares that 
it would be a great adharma on the part of that king who takes a

subjects as if they were his children. These sentiments are 
echoed by classical poets like Kalidasa in the Sakuntala V. 5 
and VL 23 and the Raghuvamsa (I. 24 } In the Harsa- 
carita(V) the dying king Frabhakaravnrdhana consoles his 
young and favourite son Harsa by exhorting him to reflect over 
the idea that kings are to bo deemed to have relatives in their 
subjects and not merely in agnates. 8 ** Asoka also in his 
Edicts harps on the paternal relation ' all men aTO my 
children' (the first separate Jaugadh Edict, C. 1 1 vol I

There were, it appears, several grades of mlers from the 
most ancient times The word lajtm occurs in numerous places 
in the Bgveda. It is applied to such gods as Mitra and Varuna 
(Rg. VH 64 %), Varuna (Rg I 24 12 and 13, X. 173. 5) 
It appears to be used in two senses, via (l)'king' asinftg. 
1 65 7, m. 43. S { 'will you make me the protector of people, tho 
king, Indra * ), IV. 4 1, IX. 7. 5, X. 174. 4 ) and (2) ' noble ' as 
in Rg. IX. 10. 3, X78.1, X.97.6 ('where the plants come 
together as nobles in an assembly ' rujuna}} samitaviua ). In Hg. 
Vm. 21 18 it is said 87 'Citra who gave thousands and ten 
thousands is the only king, others are only small chiefs along 
the bank of the SaTasvatl'. The word 'samraj' is known to 
the Bgveda and is used as an epithet of Varuna (in ftg VL 68 9) 
and of Indra (in $g VHL 16.1) andthe word samrajya also 
occurs m relation to Varuna in $g L 25 10. In &g. VIIL 37 3 
Indra is said to be sole ruler of the world ( ekarat ) It is not un-

the same sense viz ' a formidable king ' In the Tai S II 6 2. 2

relation to sovereignty over people aro not clear. They aw 
probably hyperbolical and grandiloquent words to convey sup- 
reme power. Even a brahmana, according to vodjc texts, may 
perform the Vajapeyaif he desires * svarajya ' which moans super- 
eminence. Paramesthin means ' Prajapati ' and so paramesthya 
simply means godlike power. Further there is no apparent 
reason why, after rising high from samrajya to * paramesthya * 
there should he a descent to more 'rajya' and ' maharajya . 
Sayana 9 ' takes 'rajya* and 'marmrajya' at tho end of the 
passage as referring to the position of the king in _ the 
next world. This is rather far-fetched. Jayaswal (in 'Hindu 
Polity', part 1 pp. 89-90 and p. 133 ) takes these words to 
mean* the Bhaujya constitution &c.' relying on the occurrence 
of the Bhojas in Asoka's Kock Edicts VandXBland in Khara- 
vela's Inscription, on the appearance of Bhojas as rulers in 
Western India and the town of Bhuj in Cutch and ' vairajya ' as 
kingless system and 'svarajya' as 'Belf-ruling system'; but this is 
all unwarranted and is a fair sample of the way in which some 
of Jayaswal's theories are built up. It passes one's understanding 
how a paramount sovereign is promised vairajya (in Jayaswal's 
sense ) in the Ait. Br. In the Rgveda ( V. 66. 6 ) we have the 
word 'svarajya' ("which probably means the same thing as 
' svarajya ' ) in ' Let us strive for an all-embracing sovereignty, 
which will afford protection to many' 98 . In the Satapatha 
Brahmana the distinction between a king (rajan) and an emperor 
is very clearly expressed as follows: 'For, by offering the 
Rajasuya he becomes king and by the Vajapeya he becomes 
emperor; and the office of king is the lower and that of emperor 
higher' (V. 1. 1. 13 ). Satapatha IX. 3 4. 8 contains the same 
idea again. In Satapatha I 6. & 21 it is said ' before the slaying 
of Yrtra he was Indra, it is true; but after slaying Vrtra he 
became Mahendra, even as a king ( rajan ) becomes a maharaja 
after obtaining victory '. These passages are sufficient to establish 
that the idea of a suzerainty extending over many kingdoms was 
known in the times of the Rgveda and bad been fully developed 
before the composition of the Aitareya and Satapatha Brahmanas.

feudatories humble themselves is styled ' adhlsvara', 'cakravartin' 
sarvabhauma'ie these three last words are synonyms The 
word cakravartin' is derived" by Kslrasvamin as 'one who wields 
lordship over a circle of kings ' or ' who makes the circle ( i e 
kingdom ) abide by his orders'. The word ' cakravartin ', though 
not so ancient as ' sarvabhauma ', has been employed from very 
ancient times The Maitrl TJpanisad 1 4 mentions' 4 15 cakra- 
vartins The R&janltiprakasa (p. 58) quotes' 5 a passage from 
the Samavidbana Brabmana ( BX 5. 2 ) ' the priest should perform 
the coronation with the EkavrsaSaman for that king whom he 
desires to be the sole ruler and whose circle of territory ( he does 
not desire ) to be overwhelmed ( by an enemy ) '. Here probably 
is one of the earliest references to the derivation of the word 
cakravartin. In the Mahavagga (Selasutta, SB E. vol Xp 103). 
Lord Buddha is made to say ' I am a king, an incomparable, 
religious king (dharmaraja); with justice (dhammena) I turn 
the wheel, a wheel that is irresistible *. Here the idea of the 
secular cakravartin is carried into the moral and spiritual sphere. 
In the Fansghat Inscription (of about ZOO B C ) occurs the word 
'apratihataeakasa* (i. e — cakrasya) VideASWI.vol. V p SOat

north from the sea to the Himalaya, which is a thousand yojanas 
in extent when measured in a straight line. The same idea 
ooours in the ESvyamlmarhsa of R&jasekhara (p. 92). Kautilya 
also employs the expression ' caturanto T3.J3. ' ( a king of the earth 
up to its four houndaries). Santi-parva" speaks of a ruler 
who hrings the whole earth under one umbrella. On the birth of 
Harsa, the chief astrologer told his father Prabhakaravardhana 
that the boy would be the leader of the seven cakravartins 
( Harsacarita IV ). In some woTks the six cakravartins are said 
to be Mandhata, Dhundhumara.HaTiscandra, Pururavas, Bharata, 
Kartavlrya. Tho Sabhaparva ( 15. 15-16 ) mentions five emperors 
of old viz. Yauvanasva ( Mandhata ), BhagJratha, Kartavlrya, 
Bharata and Marutta. Vide Dr. N. N. Law's ' Aspects of Ancient 
Indian Polity ' pp. 17-&1 for exhaustive lists of ancient emperors, 
from the MahabhaTata, the Satapatba Brahmana and other works. 
This ideal of cakravartin was set before them by all ambitious 
and energetic Indian rulers from ancient times. The result was 
that constant wars took place. We have a galaxy of historical 
emperors that emulated such mythical heroes and emperore as 
Mandhata and Bharata and practically realized the ideal. To 
name only a few, Oandragupta, Asoka, Pusyamitra, Bhavanaga of 
the Bharasivas, PravaTasena Yakataka, Samudragupta and Harsa 
are great names in our ancient history. Even if this ideal of 
universal empire had not been there, wars could not have been 
avoided. That was a very usual thing everywhere in the ancient 
world. Only about 700 years ago, Britain, which is a very 
Bmall country compared to India, had three kingdoms engaged in 
constant warfare. 

The Matsya-purana ( 114 9-10 ) first gives the dimensions of 
Bharata-varsa from South to Forth ( from Cape Comorin to the 
source of the Ganges ) as one thousand yojanas, states that its 
extent is ten thousand yojanas (when measured upwards across 
the boundaries ) and that on all borders of it there are Mlecohas 
and that Yavanas and Kiratas dwell to its east and west ( verse 
11 ) and that the king who conquers the -whole of Bharatavarsa is 
styled ' samrat ' ( verse 15 ). Vide Brahmapurana 17. 8 ff for 
almost the same words. The Sukranltisara (L 183-187) states that 
a samanta is one whose yearly revenue is from 1 to 3 lakhs of 
silver karsas without oppressing the people, the revenue of a 
msndalika is from 4 to 10 lakhs, that of a rajan is from 11 to 20

lakhs, of a mahar&ja from 21 to 50 lakhs, of a svarSt from 51 
lakhs to a orore, of a viral from two crores to ten, of the sarva- 
bhauma (who wields suzerainty over the whole earth i. e 
Bharatavarsa ) from 11 crores to 50. Though these definitions 
may be regarded as scholastic and too rigid to have been practically 
followed they do convey a sufficiently clear idea about the power 
of a feudatory, a king and an emperor. The Sabhaparya' 8 
( 15. 2 ) says ' there are kings in each house, who do what pleases 
them , but they do not reach the position of emperor, which title 
can be acquired with groat difficulty', and 'that king under whose 
sole dominion the world abides secures the position of samraj '• 
In these and other places ' world ' means ' Bharatavarsa ' for which 
see H. Dh vol. E pp 17-18. Sovereignty ( samrajya ) consisted 
in ancient India not necessarily or invariably in acquiring con- 
trol over vassal kings in all their affairs Generally the supreme 
ruler did not hanker after territory so much as after having his 
superior prowess acknowledged. The descriptions of digwjayas 
(world conquests) in the Mahabharata (e g. of Panduin Mi 
113, of Arjuna and the other Pandava brothers in Sabha, chap. 
26-32) show that there was no aggrandizement by acquiring 
fresh territory but all that was desired was to make the several 
kings submit and pay tribute or offer presents Arjuna 
expressly says in Sabha 25 3 that he would bring tribute from 
all kings and the conquered kingB are generally represented as 
submitting and making presents of gems, golds, horses, cows 
to the conqueror. The Allahabad stone pillar 98 Inscription of 
Samudragupta (Gupta Ins p 8) states that the pratyanta 
(bordering) kings of Samatata and other countries and the 
Malava and other tribal oligarchies fully gratified Samudra- 
gupta's commands by giving all tribute, by obeying his orders 
and by coming to perform obeisance Santi 96 insists that 
conquests should be made according to dharma Empire did 
not mean imposition of the language or the government system 
of the conqueror on the conquered country The conquerors 
duty as understood by ancient Indian works was quite different

Tltree Kinds of conquerors 69 



as will be presently shown. Kautilya (201. 1) declares' 00 that 
there are three kinds of invadorB, viz. dharmmjaym (who is 
satisfied with mere submission or obeisance), lobhamjayin (who 
is satisfied with gain in land and money), awnii'jaj/iT; (who is 
not satisfied with land and money only hut Tobs the defeated 
king of his son, wife and life ). The Nltivakyamrta ( pp. 362-363, 
Yuddhasamuddesa) defines the three almost in the same words. 
This shows that in the first two kinds of conquests the conquered 
state retained its own institutions, organisation and government 
intaot. Bana gives 10 ' in very striking language whatHarsa 
proclaimed when he started against the treacherous king of 
Gauda and on diguijaya It appears that oven the queens of 
vanquished chiefs had to perform the duties of maids at the 
time of the coronation of the emperor and empress, as queen 
Yasomatt says to Harsa (in Harsacarita Y). Vide Sabha 31. 
73-74 where Bibhlsana is said to have come with presents to 
Sahadeva. Asoka (in Kalsi Edict No. X33I in C. 1. 1. 1, pp. 44 
and 46, ed by Hultasch) speaks of his conquest being rfharma- 
vijaya. This means that he foreswore greed and cruelty and 
wanted that his influence be only acknowledged. The Pallava 
king Sivaskandavannan (of Kafici) who had performed the 
Agnistoma, Ya^japeya and Asvamedha sacrifices calls himself 
dliamma-iiKihaiajadhiraja (a dharma-vijayl emperor) in B. J, 
vol. L p. 5. In the Dudia plate of Pravarasena 31, Prthvlsena is 
styled dharma-vijayin ( E. I vol. 131 p. 258 at p. 261 ). Samudra- 
gupta's conquest of South India seems to have been only a 
dharmavijaya. As time went on the titles of kings grew in 
grandiloquence, Asoka whose empire extended at least from 
Afganistan to the Bay of Bengal and included some part of the 
Deocan and Mysore calls himself 'rajd\ Kharavela is styled only 
maharaja and Kalingadhipati in the Hathigumpha Inscription.

Huviska, the Kusana emperor, is styled McMrajcrt-ajaHraja- 
demputra (EI. vol. I. pp. 371, 386 ). Saraudragupta is simply 
maharaja (Gupta Inscriptions p 8). But later emperors styled 
themselves paramabhattaraka-maharajadhiraj'a (Gupta Inscrip- 
tions p. 70, Indore copperplate of Skandagupta of Gupta year 
146 i. o. 465-66 A. D.) or sometimes 'parama-bhattaraka-maba-

copperplate of the Valabhi king Slladitya in 447 of the Valabhi 
era i. e 766-67 A. D ). Ancient works are not very particular 
about the epithets they employ when speaking of a king or an 
emperor Santi (68 54) says that a king is praised with the 
epithets rajan, bhoja, virfit, Bamrat, ksatriya, bhupati and 
nrpa. ,0B Dasaratha is styled raja in Ayodhya 2 2. and maha- 
raja in 18.15 and 57.32. The Rajanltiratnakara (pp 3-4) holds 
that kings are of three kinds; viz. emperor (saim-at), one who 
pays tribute and one who does not pay even tribute (but is not 
a samrat), quotes several verses from a work of Narada on 
politics and states that the words cakravartin, samrat, adhlsvara 
and maharaja are synonyms. Kings aspiring to be called 
samrat performed the Rajasuya and Asvamedha in ancient 
India. The Sabbaparva 13.30 speaks of Rajasuya as fit to be 
performed by a samrat. Senapati Pusyamitra (about 180 B C ) 
is said to have performed two Asvamedhas (vide E. I vol XX 
p 54,57). TheGhosundi Inscription (E I. vol. 16 p. 25 and 
E I. vol 22 p 198 ) speaks of Sarvatata, a great devotee of Vfenu, 
as a performer of Asvamedha. Kharavela (who was a Jain) 
performed Rajasuya (E. I. vol. XX at p 79) The Vakataka 
king Pravarasena I had performed four Asvamedhas (E I. vol. 
HI p 258 and Gupta Inscriptions No 55). In the Vakataka 
copperplates the Bharasivas are extolled as having performed 
ten Asvamedhas (E. Lin 258 at p. 260) The Salankayana 
king Vijayadevavarma, whose capital was at Vengi m Anahra, 
is eaid to have performed an Asvamedha (E.IIXp 56 about 
350 A D ) The Oalukya king Pulakesm I had performed Asva- 
medha (E. L vol. VI p 1 and IX. p 100) about 550 A D Pusya-

HI J The conqueror's duties 71 

Maharaja Madhavavarman performed eleven Asvamedhas and 
one thousand Agnistomas (I. H. Q vol. IX p 278). Vide H. Dh. 
vol II pages 1238-1239 for a few more historic examples of the 
performers of Asvamedha. 

Kautilya ( VEL 16 ) prescribes that the conqueror should not 
covet the territory, wealth, sons and wives of the slain ( in 
battle), that he should re-instate the late king's kinsmen in 
their proper places ( or positions ), that he Bhould instal the son of 
the deceased king on the throne of his father and adds that the 
emperor who kills or imprisons the kings that submit and covets 
their lands, wealth, sons or wives provokes the man$ala ( the 
circle of States ) and makes it rise against himself. Yajfiavalkya 
( L 342-43 ) prescribes that it is the duty of the conqueror to 
protect the conquered country in the same way as his own 
country and the conqueror is to respect the customs of the con- 
quered country, its laws and the usages of the families therein 

The Visnudharmasutra ,os ( HI 42 and 47-49 ) enjoins upon 
the conqueror not to uproot the usages of the conquered country, 
to establish in its capital some kinsman ( of the slain king ) and 
not to destroy the royal family unless it be of low birth Manu 
(VK 202-203) and Agnipurana 236-22 prescribe similar rules 
The Kamayana (YIL 62-18-19) requires the conqueror, after 
uprooting the king, to establish another king there in order to 
ensure stable government. Vide Santi 33-43-46 quoted above on 
P. 40. Katyayana (q iu the Rajanltiprakssa p. 411) prescribes that 
even when the (vanquished) king is at fault, the conqueror 
should not ruin the country (for the fault of the vanquished 
Kmg), s mce he (the vanquished king) did not start (on his 
career of ) wrong-doing with the consent of his subjects. The 
E^anitaprakasa draws from this the conclusion that the 
ministers with whose consent the war was started may be 
harassed by ihe conqueror. This advice was generally followed

having re-established several royal families that had lost their 
kingdoms (Gupta Inscriptions, p 8). The Sukranltisara (IV. 
7>397-399 ) requires the conqueror to support the well-behaved 
son and the queen of the vanquished king or to give a fourth of 
the conquered kingdom to him and only B V part of it to one who 
is not endowed with good qualities and the conqueror may 
appropriate the whole treasury of the conquered 

The coronation of a king was a very solemn and important 
ceremony. Reasons of space forbid any lengthy treatment but 
something must be said about it In the medieval text-books, 
various procedures are described from different sources The 
Rajanltiprakasa (pp. 42-112), the Nlti-mayukha ( pp 1-13) and 
the Rajadharmakaustubha (pp. 237-374), the Raja Dh K (U. 
pp. 6-10 ) quote procedures of coronation from the Ait Br., the 
Gopatha Br., the Samavidhana Br, the Brahmapurana, the 
Visnudharmottara and other works The procedure from the 
Puranas probably originated when persons of the sudra caste 
frequently became kings. The Rajanitiprakasa 101 ( p 112 ) says 
that there being different procedures of coronation rites based on 
Vedic texts, some hold, following the dictum of Sahara (on 
Jaimini H. 4 9 ), that the coronation rite should comprehend all 
the different items mentioned in the several vedic texts ( provided 
they do not contradict each other ), while others hold that there 
should be no comprehensive inclusion of all items but each vedic 
or smrti procedure should be followed separately by itself. Mitra- 
misra concludes that the purobita should follow that course 
which is nearest to his own sakha The Rajadharmakaustubha 
(p 339 ) says that as the rite described in the Visnudharmottara 
contains the largest number of details,' one who is able to 
do so may follow that Purana, while for those who cannot 
do so there is an option or students of the Rgveda may follow the 
Rgvidhana mode, of the Samaveda the Samavidhana Br and all 
mav follow the Purana mode of coronation I shall first briefly 
indicate What procedure was followed in some vedic texts such 
as the Gopatha Brahmana, the Samavidhana Br and m the 
Grhyasutras, then point out what was done in the times of the

epics and set out the prominent items in tba procedure of the 
puranas. 

The Aitareya Brahmana ( 38 ) describes the Great Corona- 
tion of Indra(^ltnrfra tot/iSM^c/m) and in that connection mentions 
how the kings of the Satvatas in the south were called ' Bhoja ' 
after coronation, the kings of the eastern countries weTe called 
' samrat ', the kings in the -west were called ' svarat * and the 
kings of the north i a of countries beyond the Himalaya ( viz. 
TTttarakurus and Uttaramadras ) were called 'virat*. Then 
( in 39 } it states that the ksatriya king is to be made to take an 
oath and is to be crowned in the manner of the Aindra Maba- 
bhiseka 10 '. The oath which the ksatriya is to take before the 
priest with faith is : 'the merit of sacrifices and good works that 
belongs to me from the night I was born up to the night on 
which I shall die, my worlds, good deeds, life, progeny,— these 
you may destroy if I hate ( or prove false to ) thee'. Vide note 41 
above for the coronation oath in Santi 59. 106 ft It will be noticed 
that this passage of the Ait. Br. contains no undertaking given by 
the king to the people to rule according to dharma or for their 
welfare. So this passage cannot strictly be interpreted as postula- 
ting a contractual basis for the authority or power of the king, as 
donebyJayaswal( 'in Hindu Polity* part IL p. 28). The Ait 
Br. sets out the materials ( mmbharas ) for the coronation of a

They have a symbolical value. The person to be crowned re- 
cognizes the importance of his high functionaries and is declared 
to be their king and they are supposed to approve of him as 
king. In the Abhisecanlya rite of the Rajasuya, there are two 
parts, a religious and a popular. First, the adhvaryu and tho 
other priests sprinkle the king with holy water collected from 
various sources in vessels; then the king's brother, a friendly 
ksatriya and a vaisya also Bprinkle him with the holy water. 
This last is symbolic of the popular approval of the coronation. 

The Tai Br. II. 7. 15-17 deals with coronation. It first 
gives the seven mantras for seven ahutis that are offered. A 
tiger skin is spread on which the king is seated and he is 
sprinkled with holy water in which sprouts of barley and durva 
grass are mixed up ; the king ascends a chariot to the accom- 
paniment of mantras, then the four wheels of the chariot are 
touched, the purohita and charioteer are addressed with man- 
tras; Anumati, the Earth (aB mother), and Heaven (as father) 
are implored to approve of the coronation, the king is made to 
look up towards the Sun and then the king looks on the sub- 
jects; the king then undergoes shaving when seated on a chair 
of udumbaia wood, then his arms and hBad are anointed with 
milk blended with clarified butter 

The Nltimayukha pp. 4-5, Rajanltiprakasa pp 42-43, 
Rajadharmakaustubha pp. 335-336 quote a passage from the 
Gopatha Brahmana m on the rites of coronation as follows.—

make this my ksatriya prosper'. (The king) being thus bathed 
should eat the several liquids, should make gifts of a thousand 
cows to the brahmana priests who assist the chief priest, bestow

The Samavidhana Brahmana 10 * (EI 5) describes a shorter 
rite : " (The priest) should crown the king when the moon is m 
the Pusya or Sravana constellation. Having brought waters 
(separately in separate jars) from famous holy rivers (like the 
Ganges) 109 and from the sea and having mixed in them rice, 
barley, sesame and mSsa (black beans) grains and curds, honey, 
flowers and gold, he should bathe the king seated on an auspici- 
ous throne made of udumbara wood on which is spread tiger-skin 
with the hair outside, from horn-pipes cutoff from the horns of 
living cows to the accompaniment of the rahasya mantra 
'abhratrvyah' (you are without an enemy &c, Rg. VDL 2113, 
Samaveda 399 and 1489). He should bathe the king to the 
accompaniment of the Ekavrsa hymn (instead of Itg VIE. 21.13) 
whom he desires to be the sole ruler (of the earth) and whose 
circle of kings is desired by him not to be overwhelmed by an 
enemy. On the priest performing the coronation rite the king 
should bestow the best village, a hundred maid servants and a 
thousand cows and (the king) should be obedient to him (the 
officiating priest ) ". 

The Baud. Grhyasesasutra (I. 23) contains the procedure of 
coronation, the whole of which is quoted by the BalambhattI on 
the MitSksara on Yaj I 309. It is briefly as follows.— On the 
5th or 13th &«» of the bright half when the moon is in Pusya 
or Sravana or in any other auspicious constellation (naksatra), 
two brahmanas are fed (the day previous). Then a worthy 
pmofofa is chosen, who mutters certain texts. At sunset tt» 
purohita makes a lotus-like circle in which are collected the 
materials viz. waters of the ocean and of rivers mixe_d with rice, 
barley, sesame, masas and panoagavya, and a bltadrasam ; maae 
of udumbara, a tiger-skin, and golden jars and horns of cows

HI] Coronation according to Baudhaijana 77 

(Tai. S. I. 8. 6. 2). The priest first propitiates tho goddess 
LafcsmI with the hymn M0 to Sri and then washes tho crown with 
cow's urine and dung, milk, curds, clarified butter and with 
water mixed with hi&as to the accompaniment of appropriate 
mantras, and ties an amulet (pratwam), and sprinkles the king 
and his conveyance (horse ). At sunrise next day ( the day of 
coronation) the tiger-skin is spread on the throne, the king sits 
thereon facing the east, the priest takes the golden jars and 
sprinkles the king with water falling upon him from the cone- 
like horns of cows with several mantras ( such as those addressed 
to waters, Varuna &c. ). After the king is made to take a bath, 
a fee of a thousand raskas and a hundred dusts is paid to the 
brahmaDas. Then the crown is placed on his head and drums 
are beaten. 

The Kausikasiitra of the Atharvaveda ( in 17.1-10 ) des- 
cribes the abhiseka ( called laghu ) performed on the Yuvaraja, 
MSndalika, Samanta and Senapati and { in 17.11-34 ) describes 
the mahabhiseka of the king. 

In the Rarnayana there are numerous references to corona- 
tion. In the Yuddhakanda 131 we have a lengthy description 
of the coronation of Rama. Some of the salient features are : 
Rama was shaved that day, had a bath and put on costly 
clothes. Site ahso was suitably dressed and ornamented. Rama 
sat in a chariot and went through the capital, when Bharata 
heid the reins, Satrughna held the umbrella, Laksmana the 
white chowne-, then Rama rode an elephant; drums were 
beaten and conches were blown ; as auspicious signs gold, cows, 
maidens, brahmanas, men with sweetmeats in their hands passed' 
in front of Rama; the citizens had raised banners on every house; 
Jambavan, Hanuman and two others brought four jars full 
of sea-water an d waters of five hundred rivers were brought 

U0. The Visnudharmottara (H. 128. 2-6) states that the hymn to 
Sr. is deferent for each veda; the hymn of 15 verses beginning with 
Huanyavamam harimm • occurring m the pan&sta to the Hgveda is the 
one for Rgved-1, the hymn of four verses .beginning w:th 'rathe aksesu 
vrsabbasyavije' (Tta. Br. II 7. 7) is the Srlsiiktafor the Yajurveda ,the

there was dancing and singing; Rama g ave presents to the

Bibhisana and others and Slta gave a necklace to Hanumaii. 
In the Ayodhyakanda 15 we have a description of preparations 
tor the abhiseka of Rama as yuvaraja. The Raghuvamsa XVU. 
10 mentions the coronation of Kusa's son with waters of holy 
nveis ( tlrthas ) from golden jars. 

In the Mahabharata also there are several references to and 
descriptions of coronation. Vide Sabha 33 ( where people of all 
castes including sudras were invited at the Rajasuya, w 41-42) 
for the coronation of Yudhisthira; S5nti40 (in verses 9-13 
the materials for coronation are described); Adi 44, 85,101 
( only references ). 

The sambharas (materials required) of coronation are 
stated in the Pratimaniitaka (1.1) ascribed to Bhasa and in 
the Panoatantra HI ( after verse 75 ) 

In the AgnipurSna, chap 218 deals with coronation and 
chap 219 sets out the mantras The following are the principal 
items in the ceremony ; bath ( with water in which sesame and 
mustard are mixed), seating on bhadrasana, proclamation of 
abhcaja (security and non-injury to all), releasing some prisoners 
from j'ail, Aindrl Santi, fast by king, recital of mantras, sancti- 
fying the head and other limbs of the king with earth taken 
from the top of a mountain and from other places, sprinkling 
pancagavya, sprinkling of water from four j'ars of gold, silver, 
copper and earth by amatyas of the four varnas, abltiseka by a 
Rgvedin with water mixed with honey, by Ghandoga with 
water mixed with kusa grass, by Yajurvedin and Atharvavedm 
brahmanas touching king's head and throat with yellow 
pigment, singing and beating of musical instruments, holding 
of chowrie and fan before the king, king's looking into a 
mirror and clarified butter, worship of Visnu and other gods, 
sitting on a tiger-skin below which there are four skins vie of 
lion, cfteate, cat and bull ; purohita to give madhuparka, to tie 
patta ( a fillet or tiara ) round the king's head and to place the 
crown on his head ; presentation of ministers by the prakfiara;

king to give presents to the priests and other brahmanas; 
going round fire ; doing obeisance to eldors ; touching a bull , 
worshipping a cow with calf; riding a horse ; honouring an 
elephant and riding it; procession in the capital ; honouring all 
people and taking leave of them. 

There are descriptions of the ahhiseka of a yuvara]a ( as of 
Bhima in Santi 41 }, of a great commander ( as of Bhisma in 
Udyogaparva 155.26-33 ), of Drona in Dronaparva 5.39-43, of 
Skanda in Salyaparva 45. 

The Bajanltiprakasa (pp. 49-83), the Rajadharma-kaustubha 

(pp. 318-363 ) and Nitimayukha pp. 1-4 quote from the Vfcmi- 

dharmottara almost the whole of chapters 21-22 of the 2nd 

khanda that deal with the rites and mantras of coronation. It 

appears that the Kaustubha appropriates all the glosses of 

Mitramisra. The Vismidharmottara ( H. 19 ) sets out first the 

Santi ( propitiatory ) rite in honour of Indra { called the 

Paurandari or Aindrl Santij). It is impossible to give the details 

here, but a few matters may be noticed. The purana ( in 3X 

21) includes all the details from the Vedic tests (such as 

Svastyayana, Ayusya, Abhaya and Apara]ita hymns ) and adds 

other rites also. It mentions the procedure stated above from 

the Agnipurana and employs Yedic mantras in doing so. In 31. 22 

the Vismidharmottara gives purana mantras in 182 verses, in 

which such gods as Brahma, Naksatras (from Krttika to 

BharanI), the planets, 14 Manus, 11 Rudras, Visve-Devas, 

Gandharvas and Apsarases, danavas, dakinis, birds like Garuda, 

nagas, sages like Veda-Vyasa, emperors like Prthu, Dillpa, 

BhaTata, vedas and vidyas, rivers &c. are invoked to crown the 

king. 

The Rajadharmakaustubha gives the most elaborate des- 
cription of coronation. First a santi rite is performed, then on 
the next ( 2nd ) day, a sacrifice to Isana ( Rudra ) ; on the 3rd 
day worship of the planets and other deities like waters, the 
earth, Narayana, Indra &c and the invocation of naksatras ; on 
the 4th day a yaga for naksatras ; on the 5th day at night a 
sacrifice to the goddess Nirrti ( a clay idol seated on an ass with 
dark vesture ) ; on the sixth day Aindrl Santi ( propitiatory rite 
in honour of Indra); then the rites prescribed in the Visnu- 
dharaiottara purana. 

The Vismidharmottara notes ( H 18. 2-4 ) that on the death 
of the reigning king, there is no waiting for an auspicious time. 



80 History of JDharmaiastra [ Vo I. 

The successor should be bathed with water.in which sesame and 
mustard are mud, proclamation should be issued in his name that 
he has succeeded as king, the purohita and astrologer should show 
him to the people while he occupies a seat other than that 
occupied by the late king ; the king should honour the people 
proclaim peace and security, set free some prisoners and wait 
for the formal coronation. The RajanStiprak&sa (p. 62) adds 
that on the death of a king his successor should be crowned one 
year thereafter and that when a king abdicates his successor 
may be crowned on any auspicious day without waiting for a 
year. From the fact that the Kalinga king EMravela was 
crowned in his 25th year and the fact that the Barhaspatya- 
sutra '" ( L 89-90 ) states that up to the 25th year the prince may 
spend his time in play and education and then in earning wealth, 
Jayaswal (in 'Hindu Polity* part Up 52) concludes that a 
Hindu coronation could not take place before the 25th year 
This is proving too much. The Barhaspatya-sutra says not a 
word about the age of coronation Authorities like the Vismi- 
dharmottara require waiting for a year only after the death of 
the former king. 

Theyisnudharmottara 11 * (II 7) specifies at great length 
the qualities of the principal queen (agra-maliisi), which are 
quoted by the Rfijanltikaustubha pp. 249-250 The chief queen 
should hare the coronation rite performed along with the king 
or she should be separately crowned after the king. Manu 
VH. 77 advises the king to marry a lady of noble family, of the 
same caste, of charming appearance and possessed of good 
qualities. The Rajataranginl ( V3JI. 82 ) notes that Jayamati, 
the queen of the good king TJccala of Kashmir (1101-1111 A. D.) 
always occupied half his throne. 

The Nltimayukha and Rajadharmakaustubha give the most 
detailed description of the Aindrl Santi. For want of space it 
has to be passed over. The Rajanltiprakasa (pp. 63-66) and 
Rajadharmakaustubha (pp 340-346) contain in one place a 
Bummary of the whole ceremony after Aindrl Santi commencing 
one day previous to the actual day of coronation. One detail of the

from the sea and other holy places. m There is a graphic descrip- 
tion of the coronation of Shiva]! 1 "" the founder of the Maratha 
Empire in 1674 A. D. in the chronicle (baMutr) compiled by 
Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad ( ed. by E, H. Sane, pp, 98-104 ) t where 
it is said that a costly throne was prepared, from 108 places watcru 
were brought in 108 golden jars (95 ththa$ are actually named), 
Gagabhatta and other br&hmanas officiated and sprinkled waters 
on the king, large gifts including the sixteen mahadan&s were 
made. Eight ministers stood round the throne ( whose names 
and offices are set out ), the head of the ecclesiastical department 
called Panditrao being to the Tight and the prime minister 
( mukhya pradhana ) to the left, an umbrella ( chatra ) set with 
jewels was held over his head, new golden coins were struck and 
a new era was started called 'Rajyabhiseka' era commencing from 
that year. In a small work called ' Shivaraja-rajyabhiseka-kalpa- 
taru ' ( published in the quarterly Journal of the Bharata-itiMsa- 
samsodbaka Mandala at Poona, vol X part I pp. 28-40 ) in 236 
verses it is stated that a Yogin named Niscalapuri, an adept in 
Tantrika rites, got a second coronation of Shivaji performed over 
three months after that performed by Gagabhatta, with Tantrika 
mantras on Wednesday the 5th of the bright half of Asvina sake 
1596, one interesting fact stated being that Shivaji went through 
a form of marriage with vaidika mantras with his wives that had 
already been married to him with p auranio mantras.

Tlie symbols of royalty viz the umbrella, the chowries and 
the cane stick are brought in to the king by principal ministers 
The Visnudharmottara ( IL 12 ) states that the camara for the 
king must be made from the tails of camari deer and must be all 
white with a handle of gold or silver and that the one for a 
councillor or purohita should be yellowish, while the same purana 
in 11. 13 describes the requisites of a royal umbrella That the 
umbrella and camaras were inseparable emblems of sovereignty 
is emphasized by Kalidasa in JXaghuvamsa HL 16 Vide the 
Brhatsamhita, chap. 71 and 72, for camara and umbrella 

It appears that sometimes a king took another name on 
coronation which was called abhisekanama Vide Dr. B G 
Majumdar's ' Champa ' p 157 for a list of such names from 
Champa and Dr. Minakshfs 'Administrative and social life 
under Pallavas' p. 39 for the Pallava Rajasirnha having the 
coronation name Narasimhavarman Certain kings, when they 
performed Asvamedha, assumed new titles e. g Eiunaragupta I 
seems to have assumed the title of Mahendra, as is clear from 
some of his coins on which his name and title occur 

The Brhatsamhita of Varahamihira (chap. 48) lays down 
that the palta (tiara) for the king and others should be made of 
pure gold, that their length should be double of the breadth in 
the middle of it, that there should be five aigrettes in the king's 
tiara, three in the queen's and yuvaraja's, one in that of the 
commander-in-chief and none in the one that the king may give 
to a person as a mark of favour Utpala in his com on the 
Brhatsamhita says that patta is the same as mtduta, while ace 
to the Nltimayflkha (p 13) and other works patta is tied on 
the forehead and mukuia( crown) fc> placed on the king's head 
Vide Bajanltiprakasa (pp 54-55) and Rajadharmakaustubha 
(p. 324) for further details The Visnudharmottara (TLU) 
describes the characteristics of bhadiasana( the throne) for the 
king; vide also Rajanltiprakasa pp 51-52 It must be made 
of gold, silver or copper or a tree from which milky juice 
oozes when cut, it was to be one cubit and half high for a 
samrat, If cubit for a king and one cubit high for a feudatory 
(samanta)

versary of the first coronation when the moon is m &e sara

quoted by the R. D. K. (p. 10) also says the same. 1,3b Vide 
EajanStiprakasa p, 115 and Kaustubha p. 379 ateo. 

Manu (VII. 217-220 ) warns the king against poisoning ' The 
king should partake of food that is well oxamined and prepared 
by servants that arc trust-worthy ( lit. as if they were his own 
self), that know the proper times (for dining), that cannot be 
won over and over the food spells destroying poison should have 
been muttered. He should mix up in all that he partakes medi 
cines that are antidotes against poison and should always wear 
gems that work against poison. Only women devoted to him 
and well examined and found safe as regards their dress and 
ornaments should be allowed to touch him when fanning or bath- 
ing him or applying perfumes to his body. The king should 
take care in thL way as regards his vehicles, bed, food, bath, 
applying perfumes and all ornamentation'. Earn VH 8 and 
Matsya 219.10 are very similar to Manu Vll 220. Kautilya 
(1.17) states that the king should first secure his personal 
safety against his sons and wives and then the security of the 
kingdom against near and distant enemies. He first deals with 
safety from his own sons, the princes. The opinions of various 
authors on polity are cited (some of which have been noted 
above) viz. secret punishment (ace. to Bharadv5 3 a), keeping 
under guard in one place ( ace. to VisSlaksa ), keeping the prince 
in a fort under the boundary guard (ace. to the Parasaras), keep- 
ing the prince away from his own kingdom in a fort belonging 
to a feudatory ( ace. to Pisuna), sending him to his maternal re- 
lations (ace to Kaunapadanta), making the prince addicted to 
sensual pleasures (ace. to Vatavyadhi), proper pre-natal care and 
proper education after birth about dharma and restraint (ace. 
to Kaut.) This symposium shows bow the problem of the 
kings safety against bad princes taxed the ingenuity of all 
ancient writers on ArfcasSstra and how Kautifya Jvlted

position" 1 In I 20 Kautilya gives practical hints against the 
danger of fire and poisons : e g he says that poisonous snakes 
will not enter a building provided with Jlvantl, Sveta and other 
plants; that cats, peacocks, mongoose and spotted deer when let 
loose eat serpents, that certain birds like parrots, maims, malbar 
bhd shriek when they suspect snake poison, the heron loses his 
consciousness in the vicinity of poison, the pheasant (jivafi- 
jfvaka) feels exhausted; the young cuckoo dies, the eyes of 
ralcoia become reddei " 5 . Kam (Vn 10-13) repeats the words of 
Kaut 120 and the Matsya (219 17-22) lefers to the effects of 
poison on the same birds and a few others The Matsyapurana 
in chap 219-220 closely follows Kaut and Earn and appears 
to be based on them ( e g Matsya 219 30 latter half is the same 
as Kam VH 24 first half ) Vide Yasactilaka HI pp 511-512 
for the effects of poison on birds almost in the same woids as 
those of Kaut and Kam Vide Sukra I 326-328 Kaut I 21, 
Kam VII 15-26, Matsya 219 9-32 state that part of the food 
for the king should first be cast into fire and offered to birds and 
the effects noted, they dwell at gieat length on the different tints 
of the flames of fire and of the smoke when different kinds 
of food are cast into fire, they point out the actions and ges-

a conveyance or riding a horse or travelling in a boat or when 
attending festivals (Kaut I 20-21, Kam VH 28-47) Kaut

years in the harem and found Ul safe. Kaut. (1 20 ) and Kam. 
(VH 51-54) both name seven kings that met death in their 
queen's chambers by the stratagems of the queens themselves or 
those that were incited by them; vjk. Bhadrancna killed by 
his brother concealed in the chamber of his queen (who was in 
love with the king's brother), the king of Karusa killed by his 
own son who had concealed himself under the bed of the queen 
(who was angered by the king's promise to give the kingdom to 
the son of a rival queen), the king of Kasi killed by his queen 
who mixed fried rice with poison pretending that it was honey ; 
the queen of the king of Sauvira killed him with a jewel in her 
girdle that was smeared with poison; Vairantya was killed by 
his queen with her anklet smeared with poison; JalQtha (or 
Jarusain Kam.) was killed with a mirror (with a razor-like 
edge) covered with poison; Viduratha was killed by his queen 
who had concealed a weapon in her braided hair. The Harsa- 
carita (VI) of Bana mentions with additional details the cases 
ofBhadrasenakingof Kalinga killed by his brother Virasena, 
the king of KarQsa (Dadhra by name), Kasiraja (named Maha- 
sena) whose queen Suprabha killed him to secure the kingdom to 
her son, Jarutha king of AyodhyS, Vairantya named Rantideva, 
Viduratha of the Vrsnis killed by Bindumatt, the Sauvira king 

,*ff »w kiUed by qUeen Hamsa ™tl. In the Brhatsamhita 
J i"*) two of these, Viduratha and Kasiraja, are mentioned 
but the latter is said to have been killed by his estranged queen 
with an anklet smeared with poison. Medbatithi on Manu 
vn 153 quotes four of these seven TheNitivakyamrtafraia- 
ratomuddesa 35-36, pp. 231-232) sets out six other examples 
of kings killed by their queens The king has also to beware 
ot treachery from ministers and officials. Kant, (in I 10) des- 
cubes how ancient writers devised methods of ascertaining the 
purity oi- impurity of ministers by putting before them allure- 
ments regarding dharma, wealth, sexual desires and playing on 
heir fears and gives it as his own opinion that temptations that 
have dn-ect reference to the king or queen should not be placed 
m the way of the ministers. In the Harsacarita VI,Skanda- 



86 History of Dhai maSaslra [ Vol. 

gupta, the commander of the elephant arm of Harsa's army, 
warns the Emperor against putting trust in everybody and 
gives 19 instances of kings that met misfortunes, death or des- 
truction through their own carelessness and the stratagems of 
those ahout them ( apart from the seven mentioned above and 
two more who fell victims to the wiles of their queens) Some of 
them are famous and deserve mention here, viz the king of Vatsa 
( i e Udayana ) who was imprisoned by the soldiers of Mahasena 
that jumped out of a faked elephant ; Maurya Brhadratha killed 
by his Senapati Pusyamitra (called 'anarya' by Bana on account 
of his treachery to his master); Kakavarna Saisunari (Saisunagi ?), 
Sumitra, son of Agnimitra, whose head was cut off by Mitradeva 
while the king fond of dancing was in the midst of aotors , 
the 6unga Devabhfiti killed by his minister Vasudeva; Candra- 
gupta ( of the Gupta dynasty ) who dressed as a charming woman 
cut off the king of Sakas; the foolish Maukhari king Ksatra- 
varman killed by bards Vide Kamasutra V 5 30 for two other 
examples of the Abhira king KottarSja and Jayatsena king of 
Kfisi The Nltivakyamrta ( Dutasamuddesa ) p 171 states that 
Canakya killed one of the Nandas through a duta and that two 
other kings met death from presents of poisoned clothes and a 
jewelled box containing snake poison. The Yasastilakacampu 
(III pp 431-432) sets out many instances of kings that met with 
death from the wrath or the machinations of their ministers, 
purohita &c 

From these examples one should not draw the facile and 
sweeping conclusion that in India the life of no king was safe. 
In the vast continent of India there were always numerous king- 
doms at the same time It is no wondei that in the course of 
several thousand years and over such vast territories, some 
kings met death by treachery and stratagem. This is not a 
phenomenon restricted to India In a small country like 
England we have within two hundied yeais instances of tne 
murder of the boy king Edward V and his brothei pnnce 
Richard, of Lady Jane Grey nominated by Edwaid VI as his 
successor and the further fact that Cromwell during the last few 
months of his life was afraid of being assassinated During 
about 150 years from 1789 out of 30 Presidents of theU SA 
several such as, Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley met death at the 
hands of assassins 

The truth is that in a monarchy the king was the pivot of 
the Sole sSte As the MatsyapurSna (219.34) finely puts H 



HI] Hemlilury monarchy 87 

' the king was flic root and the subjects wore the tree ; iti :„iving 
the king from dangers the whole kingdom was on the road to 
prosperity and therefore all were to make efforts to guard the 
king' 

Hereditary monarchy was the norm of government in 
ancient and medieval India. Kautilya oxpre-ssly states (I. 17 
at end ) that the practice to make the oldest con the king in 
honoured except in the case of a calamity. At or about the time 
of Buddha and a few centuries thereafter there wore a few 
oligarchies or ( as some scholars prefer to call them ) republics. 
But our Dharrnasastra or Artbasastra authorities contain rather 
very meagre references to them. The Mahabharata in Santi 107 
furnishes the following data about ganarajyas { government by 
groups ) : Internal dissensions are the root of the ruin of j/«p«s ; 
it is very difficult to keep lines of policy secret when there are 
many ( when the government is that of many, i. e. an oligarchy 
or a republic ) ; all members of the gana in their entirety do not 
deserve to hear the line of policy decided upon, hut the chief 
persons among the ganas should meet together and arrange 
among themselves to secure the welfare of the whole gana ; if 
disputes that arise among the families ( or clans) are connived 
at by the heads of the clan, the ruin of the clan takes place 
which leads on to dissensions among the whole group (gana) 
Danger from internal dissensions must be guarded against { in 
the case of garni ajw), external dangers are not serious { in the 
case of ganarajya). All members of the gana are equal by 
birth and family, but they are not equal in energy, intelligence, 
bodily appearance and wealth. By their enemies ganas arc 
broken by means of internal dissensions and bribes; therefore

about by internal dissensions and corruption and it hits off the 
qualities required in the wise leader of the sangha to he four 
viz sagacity, forbearance, self-control and giving up the acqui- 
sitive spirit The words sangha and gam are employed as 
synonyms in the Mahabharata Panini (HI 3 86 ) states that 
snnglia means gana. Patafijali in his Mahabhasya ( vol II p 356) 
states that sangha, samulia and samudaya mean the same thing 
Panini knows two kinds of sanghas viz uyudlnfimn (who practis- 
ed the profession of arms) and those that were not so and 
further he also indicates that in the Vahika country sanghaa 
included" 8 brahmanas, ksatriyas and others (vide V. 3 114). 
He names the sanghas of Vrkas, Trigartas, Yaudheyas, Parsus 
( V 3 115-117 ) as ayudhajiwn EMyayana by his vmhka

Kautilya ( p 53 above ) the sangha of the Vrsnis perished when it 
came in conflict with Dvaipayana In another place Kautilya 
says that (m some cases) the kingdom may be ruled by a 
clan, for the confederacy IM of a clan is invincible, it is freo 
irom the calamity of a kingless State and therefore exists on the 
earth very long Kautilya devotes one section (Adhikarana 
XI) to the dealings of the ambitious king with sanghas. There 
he states that securing the sangha on one's side is far better 
than securing an army or allies and makes the most interesting

occasion required Kautilya then describes in detail without 
any scruples how the conqueror may by various subterfuges 
cause dissensions among the members of the sangha and iti 
leadeT or leaders (sangha-milhya) In VjJU. 3 Kautilya 
remarks that dissension becomes particularly rife owing to 
gambling among sanghas and noble clans that have the Bangha 
constitution and they are destroyed. From about the 5th 
or 6th century A. D. the oligarchic States or Eepublics became 
rare and gradually disappeared. We get further data about 
these ganarajyas from Buddhist works, Greek sources ( like the 
fragments of Megasthenes), coins and inscriptions. Rudradaman 
(in Junagadh Inscription of 150 A. D.) boasts that he had 
uprooted the Yaudbeyas who had become puffed up and 
unbending on account of the title of heroes ( vim ) that was 
prominently applied to them among all ksatriyas" 1 (E L 
vol VJn. at p. 44 ) Samudragupta ( in the first half of the 4tu 
century A. D.) subjugated the Yaudheyas, Malavas, Arjunayanas 
&o. In Gupta Inscriptions No. 58 p. 351 there is mention 
of a makaraja-maliasenapati who was made their leader by the 
Yaudheya-gana. The Brhatsamhita in several places refers to the 
Xaudheyas and Ajjunayanas ( e g 4.25; 5,40, 67, 75- 1425

'Hindu Polity 'parti chap. VHI(pp 63-79 ) for Hindu Repub- 
lics mentioned an Greek writings Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist 
India' pp 19 if. summarizes the data about Indian republics 
derived from Buddhist works. On p 22 he gives the names ot 
eleven republican clans with their capitals, some of which like 
the Sakyao ( of Kapilavastu ), the Mallas (of Kusmara and Pava), 
the Videhas (of Mithila) and Licchavis (of Vesali) are well- 
known. Rhys Davids states (p. 19 ) that the administrative and 
judicial business of the Sakyas was earned on hi a mote-hall 
(santhagara) at Kapilavastu, that a single chief was chosen 
(but how and for what period is not known) who presided over 
the sessions and (when no sessions were being held) also ovei 
the State, that he bore the title of >aja He mentions that at 
one tune Buddha's cousin Bhaddiya was » Uja and that in another 
passage Buddha's fathei Suddhodana is styled raja He further 
points out (p. 26) that the Varans had eight confederate clans 
of which the Licchavis and the Videhas were the most impor- 
tant. K P. Jayaswal m 'Hindu Polity' part I pp 25-165 
brings together all the data about Hindu oligarchies (or repub- 
lics as he calls them ) and his work deserves the serious atten- 
tion ot all those who are interested m the study of ancient 
Indian political institutions, though here and there one cannot 
approve of his inteipretations and theories To take only one 
example, he holds that the procedure prescribed by Buddha for 
the deliberations of the sangha m the Mahaparinibbana-sutta was 
boiTowed from the procedure followed by the republics m their 
deliberations and therefore he describes the procedure of the 
Buddhist sangha in great detail ( ' Hindu Polity,' part I chap XI 
pp 103-117) Dr D R Bhandarkar also (in 'Some Aspects tit 
Ancient Hindu Polity' pp 121-125) adopts this theory This to 
say the least is a gratuitous assumption The mere fact ttot 
Buddha told the prime minister of Ajatasatru, king of Magadtta,

vol XVII p. 264 ff, Cullavagga IV. 9, S. B. E. vol. XX pp. 24-27) 
was the procedure of the meetings of the oligarchies. The seven 
conditions (hoth for the welfare of the Vajjians and the Sangha) 
are set out in the Mahaparinibbaria-sutta, chap. I. (S. B E. 
vol. XI. pp. 3-8) viz holding full and frequent public assem- 
blies, meeting togethei in concord and carrying out undertakings 
in concord, enacting nothing not already established and abro- 
gating nothing that has been already enacted and acting in 
accordance with ancient institutions established in former dayj, 
honouring and revering and supporting elders and hearkening 
to their words, not detaining women or girls of their clans by 
force or abduction, honouring and supporting Va)jian shrines in 
town or countay and not allowing proper offerings and rites 
to fall into desuetude, protecting and supporting the Arahats 
among them. On the most important points in connection 
with a republic oi oligarchy we have no information at all, viz. 
who were entitled to vote, what were the qualifications for 
membership of the assembly that governed the State, how 
voting took place, what was the period for which mem- 
bers of the assembly were elected, whether the president was 
elected for life or a shorter period or was elected at all, what 
were the powers and procedure of the assembly. Vide Dr. Beni 
Prasad in 'Hindu Political Theories' p 158 for criticisms. 
Ehys Davids ( in ' Buddhist India ' p. 41 ) says that according 
to the Jatakas there were at Vesali (modern Basadh in the 
Muzaffarpur District ), the capital of the Licchavis, 7707 iajG<. 
{ or chiefs }. In the Bhaddasala-jataka { Fausboll, vol. IV p 148 ) 
there is a lefeience to a tank reserved for the bath of the families 
of the ruling chiefs ( rajas ) of the gana in the city of Vesali. 
In the Mahavastu (ed by Senart vol. L p. 271) it is stated 
that there were twice eighty-four thousand nobles (rajanS) 
among the Licchavis. This explains what Kautilya means by

dates. Vide Dt D R Bhandarkar's ' Some aspects of Ancient

several types of republics in Ancient India, 

Another important question is whether in monarchical states 
theie were popular assemblies of elected representatives or, in 
modern language, Parliaments. The words ' sabha ' and ' samiti ' 
require consrideiation in this connection In l$g I 91 20 Soma is 
naid to confer a son who is' s2rfan»/a, vidathya and snblieya, from 
which it follows that sabha v is in some respects different from 
'vidatha*. In Rg IT 24 13 a vipra (a priest or composei of 
hymns) is said to be sabJieya * clever or eminent in a sabha'. In 
ftg X 34 6 'Babha' ,M appears to mean a gambling hall In 
Vaj S XXX 6 sabhaana seems to mean only 'sabhasad', a mem- 
ber of a judicial tubunal, while in XXX 18 the sabhasthanu is 
given up to Askanda in the symbolic Purusamedha. In the Vaj. 
S XVI 24 there is an obeisance to sdbhas and sabliapahi (presidents 
of sabhas) In Atharvaveda VH 12 1 'sabiia' and 'samiti' are said 
to be the two daughters of Prajapati.from which it may by argued 
that they were veiy similar but somewhat different. In Atharva- 
veda XV. 9 2 also sabha and samiti are separately mentioned In 
Tai. Br HL 7 4 the word sabhapala occurs and sabha is explained 
as ' gambling-hall ' by Sayana In Bg X 97 6 and Vaj S XII. 80 it 
is said ' that upra is said to be a doctor (bhisak) in whom medicinal 
herbs come together as nobles (rajanah) in a sarmti (meeting or 
battle)'. In Rg. X 191 3 the word 'samiti' seems tomeanno 
more than a meeting or meeting place In Atharvaveda V 19 15 
we have ' the assembly ( samiti ) does not suit him ( oi is not won 
over by him ) who harasses a brahmana ' In the Chandogya up.

be present. K P. Jayaswal ( in ' Hindu Polity ' part 1 p 11 ) 
holds that ' samiti ' in the vedic age was the national assembly 
of the whole people, that it was the king's duty to attend it 
( iforf. p. 12 ) and that ' sabha ' was the standing and stationary 
body of -selected men working under the authority of the samiti 
{ibnl. p. 18)'. This is all conjectural, as Jayaswal himself 
admits 'the <sabha was certainly related to the samiti, but its 
exact relationship is not deducible from the data available ' 
(rfctf.p.18). 

These frantic efforts by such scholars as Jayaswal to prove 
that India had elective assemblies are made to counteract the 
sinister propaganda of many English writers that East is East 
and West is West and that the democratic institutions of the 
West cannot be transplanted with success on the soil of India 
Tliis is mischievous propaganda. There wore no democracies 
even in Europe a few hundred years ago ; even in England, 
France and a few other countries democracies have been intio- 
duced and have thrived within a short time There is no reason 
why they should not do so in India, if honest efforts are made 
and difficulties are not purposely created by vested interests 
Korkunov in ' General theory of law * ( tr. by Hastings, 1923, 
New York p 296 ) says ' According to the historical school the 
political organization of England is good for England alone, 
for it corresponds to a natural genius very peculiar.. .This 
doctrine of the historical school is false, since we have already 
seen that a change produced in the social ideal may bring about 
a change m the whole social development The influence of 
one people on the life of another is a proof of this The ideal is 
a force supporting the social life and this ideal may be the 
result not merely of our own special experience, but also of the 
experience of neighbouring peoples '. 

Two other woids require consideration, viz. Paum and 
■Junnpada. The word 'paura' occurs in Rg V. 74. 4 where it 
has tiuee applications, viz. to the Asvins, to the sage Paura 
(who was an Ataja, and to the cloud (ace. to Sayana). 
K.P Jayaswal {m* Hindu Polity', part II pp 60-108) devotes 
considerable space to ' Paura ' and ' Ts„ Q „„;i„ ■ j "evoies

at p. 45 or in the Eamayana 1L 2. 51,11. 111. 19 'paurajanapadnm 
janam'). Lastly if the paurajanapada organization bad (as 
said by Jayaswal in the quotation cited above) the power to 
depose kings and pass even hostile statutes, is it not a contradic- 
tion in terms to say that, instead of the Parliament or Diet 
deciding to remit certain taxes, it was the king who remitted 
taxes and bestowed favours ( or privileges ) of lakhs of rupee's on 
the supposedly all powerful Paura-Janapada absembly ? In all 
passages that he quotes from the Ramayana and other classical 
Sanskrit works the ordinary meaning of paut a (residents of the 
capital ) and janajxtda ( inhabitants of the country other than 
the capital ) is quite enough and it is impossible to hold that any 
elective body is meant In most passages the plural 'paura- 
janapadan' is used. If ' Paura-janapada' stands for one elective 
body or two bodies, no explanation is offered why the plural 
should generally be used and not the dual. Kautilya (1. 19 ) 
states that the king should in the 2nd part of the day ( divided 
into eight parts) look into tho causes of the paura-janapadas. 
Jayaswal ( in * Hindu Polity ', part II p. 95) misinterprets this 
passage by saying that the king had to set apart one period 
daily for the business of the paura-janapada assembly. Here 
again the plural is used and the dictum of Kautilya is the same 
as that of Yaj. L 327 who says that the king should look into the 
law-suits (vyavaharan) of the people. The word 'karya' ic 
employed by Manu VIIL 43, Narada and other writers on 
vyavaharainthesenseof 'law-suit'. Yaj. JL 36 says that the 
king should restore to the janapada property stolen by thieves. 
Jayaswal ( in 'Hindu Polity', part II. p. 93 ) presses the singular 
lanapadaya' into his service and holds that it was the popular 
assembly that demanded the restoration of the things Btolen. 
ibis, to say the least, is twisting the plain words of Yaj. The 
Mit paraphrases the word to mean ' to the person dwelling in 
ms country from whom the property was stolen*. The corres- 
ponding pasbage of Manu VHL 40 (datavyam sarva-varnebhyo 
^nacorair-hrtamdhanamjis quite clear, since it fortunately 
toes not use the word janapada and Medhatithi explains it as ' it 
should be restored to those from whom it was stolen'. Jayaswal 
(m Hindu Polity 'part II p. 79) holds that a passage in the

But the plain moaning is that the mintmaster was to mint 
standard silver and gold coins for all people when they broS 
bulhon to l„m to have n, struck One strikmg circuSS 
to be considered is that, though in all works on pohty a ,n m „ 
said to have seven elements, none of them includes a po] focal 
elective assembly (like the paura-janapada postulated by 
Jayaswal ) among them. They only enumerate the country and 
the capital and declare even these as of lesser importance than 
the king and the ministers. Another matter that makes the 
existence of powerful elective political assemblies in monarchies 
most unlikely is the total absence of any reference in works on 
polity to the method of election, the system of voting, the qualifies- 
turns of members, the period for which the assembly was elected 
and allied matteis When medieval writers like Apararka on Ygj 
11 l(p 600) quote from Brhaspati verses about four kinds of 
sabha, they refer only to judicial tnbunals of various sorts and 
grades ( the same verses ale quoted as Harita's in Bajaniti- 
ratnakarap 20) Viden 368 below 

If elective popular assemblies did not exist, then it may be 
Ubkod whether the king was an absolute monaich or a despot or 
whether there were any checks that mitigated or regulated 
the power and doings of monarchs. The answer is that there 
were such checks and limitations These were of various kinds 
Exhortations addressed to the king hunself exercised a restrain- 
ing influence. For example, Eat (10) says 'the king who give-, 
way to wrath without pioper thought would reside in a horrible 
hell for half a Kalpa' The importance of dharma as an all- 
embracing institution was impressed upon the king by our 
writers no frequently that it must have had its psychological 
effect on every king The idea that danda personified as a Deity 
might strike down the bad king himself (Manu VH. 19, 37, 28, 30» 
Yaj I 354-356 ) would tend to keep even a whimsical king 
within bounds. The views of ancient writers have already been 
cited according to which the king was not to act as he pleas- 
ed, but was to regard his high office as a sacred trust and was 
to rule aocordmg to the dictates of the* sastras These views 
created public opinion which must have certainly influenced the 
king's acts The ideal king Blima is depicted as having 
abandoned his queen Site ( whom he knew to be pure ) because 
the people could not accept her as pure after her long stay in 
Havana's prison Vide EamSyana VH. 45 Then there were 
the ministers whose advice the king was enjoined to seek 
Besides there was the purohita and there were learned brahmanas, 



jjj] Checks on kings 97 

who were to propound what dharma was, whoso directions he 
was to carry out and who were supposed to have power to ram 
a bad king (vide Vas L 39-41, Gautama XI. 12-14, Manu IX. 320). 
Vide H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 138-145 for the peculiar sanctity 
attaching to the person of a brahmann and the superior position 
ofbrahmanasasaclass ws-a-ws the king. There was a deep- 
rooted faith that the rules of the sfistras ( the Srauta and Smarta 
dharma) were divinely inspired and were above the king. 
Observance of dharma was the great social and political ideal 
from very ancient times for all including the king. This is 
most emphatically put in the Br. Up. I 4. 11-14, where it is 
stated " even after creating the four varnas He ( the Creator ) 
did not think that stability had been attained. He then created 
the most excellent Mai ma which is the might of the mighty 
( i e. more powerful than the warrior caste ) There is nothing 
higher than dharma Even a very weak man hopes to pievail 
over a very strong man on the strength of dharma, just as (he 
prevails over a %vrong-doer ) with the help of the king. So what 
is called dharma is leally truth. Therefore people say about a 
man who declares the truth that he is declaring dharma and 
about one who declares what dharma is they say that he speaks 
the truth These two ( dharma and truth ) are this " (i. e. one). m 
Kamandaka L 14 stated that the Yavana king ruled over the 
earth for a long time because he ruled according to the dictates 
of dharma. In his administration of justice the king was to be 
checked by the judge and sabhyas, who were fearlessly to render 
advice to the erring king ( as will be shown in the section on 
vyavahara ). Besides corporations and guilds were powerful and 
had a sort of self-government. Manu ( VB2. 336 and Yaj. H. 307 ) 
went so far as to prescribe a heavy fine which the king was to 
inflict on himself for his illegal exactions and punishments and to 
direct that the king should distribute among brahmanas wealth 
forfeited by grave sinners ( Manu IX. 243-244 ). Lastly there 
was the final sanction that the sastras allowed the subjects to 
abandon a worthless king ox even to kill a misguided one or 
tyrant, as stated above (vide Mami VIL 27-28, Aithasastra 1. 4). m

98 History of JDharmaiastra [ Vol. 

Kautilya (VUI. 3) when dealing ,M with the evil results of 
want of discipline in a king states that kings who are hot- 
tempered are known to have fallen victims to popular fury ( or 
the fury of ministers ) We may Bay that in theory and so far as 
ordinary people were concerned the sovereign's power was absolute 
and unlimited as Manu IX. 9-12 aptly illustrate and as Brhat- 
Parasara states ' the king is Brahma, Siva, Visnu, Indra, he is 
the giver, the destroyer, and the enforcer according to the karma 
of his subjects'. But there were (as stated above ) very real 
checks and limitations that effectively prevented him from exer- 
cising his undoubtedly unlimited powers These checks, though 
real, cannot be called constitutional in the sense in which that 
word is used in modern times. As said by Narada the subjects 
are dependent while the king is uncontrolled, but he could not 
go against the sastra ( vide Haradatta on Gaut XL 2 ) 

In modern times the activities of a sovereign person^ are 
three-fold, viz. executive, judicial and legislative The judicial 
activities of the ancient Indian king will be dealt with in 
another section on law and the administration of justice One 
great difference between ancient and modern societies is that 
the legislative action of the king was extremely limited in 
ancient times, while in modern times people are more and more 
looking to legislation for regulating all manner of things 
Manu (VH. 13 ) lays down that since the king has in him the 
glory of all deities, whatever rule as regards desirable matters 
the king establishes and whatever action he declares as un- 
desirable among those actions that are harmful, should not be 
transgressed by any one In his gloss on this verse Medhatithi 
carefully points out what orders the king can issue and on what 
subjects he cannot issue orders He gives the following : inst- 
ances of orders_2f_bpth kinds : ' To-day all should observe a festival 
in the capital, all should attend a marriage ceremony at the 
house of the minister ; animals should not be killed to-day by 
the butchers and birds should not be caught . debtors should not 
be harassed by creditors on these days ( to be specified ) , no one 
should associate with such and such a man (an undesiraDie 
person); no one should allow a certain (undesirable) person 
to enter the house'. Medhatithi adds that the king is dot 
authorised to interfere with the iastnc rides governing

drum that his edicts should be written and displayed whore four 
roads'meet, and that the king should declare that breaches of too 
orders would entail heavy fines. In I 292-311 Sukra gives 
instances of such orders, the most important of which are: 
■Watchmen should take rounds in the several streets every one 
hour and a half at night in ordeT to prevent thieves and 
paramours moving about; people should not employ abuse or 
beating towards their slave, servant, wife, son or pupil ; no one 
should practice deceit in respect of measures, weights, coins, 
resins, metals, ghee, honey, milk, fat, flour; no document 
should be got by force ; no bribes should be taken nor should 
any bribes be given to persons engaged in doing the king's 
work ; no one should offer shelter to bad characters, thieves, 
paramours, those who hate the king, the enemy; parents, 
persons worthy of honour, learned men, men of good character 
should not be disrespected or ridiculed; no dissensions should 
be sown between husband and wife, master and servant, between 
brothers, between teacheT and pupil, between father and son; 
no interference or obstruction should be caused to wells, parks, 
boundaries, dliarmasalas, temples, roads or to those who are 
deficient in a limb; without the king's permission no one 
should engage in gambling, selling liquor, hunting, bearing 
arms, sale or purchase of cattle or elephants or horses or camels 
or she-buffaloes or slaves or immoveable property or silver, gold, 
gems, intoxicants, poisons, drugs, the profession of medicine or 
should pass a sale deed, deed of gift or give a decision about a 
debt ; no one should falsely accuse another of the great sins, 
nor take treasure trove, nor frame new rules for clubs or con- 
vivial gatherings ( samaja) nor should publish slander against a 
caste, nor should appropriate property which is without an 
owner or has been lost, nor divulge the ( king's ) lines of policy, 
nor babble about the vices of the king ; the people should not

Mich as truthfulness, obodioncc and reverence to parents, elders

by the assembly (parfead) of men deeply learned in the three 
Vedas The authoritativencss of customs, usages and conven- 
tions and their relation to sastra will be discussed later on. 
In the decision of causes there were four deciding factors, 
dharma, vyavahara, caritra and raja&sana, which will also bo 
dealt with later. So royal edicts or orders first camo to be made 
in the administration of justice and probably served as laws or 
precedents in later times. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 968-970 for the 
role of parisads in religious matters. Ysj 1. 9 and Sankha speak of 
parrot or assembly of learned men as final authorities on dharma. 
The executive functions of the king required a large number 
of ministers and officers. This topic will be dealt with immedia- 
tely below. 

There is another way of looking at the king's functions viz. 
they were religious and secular. The first required him to do 
certain acts for propitiating gods and unseen powers and 
removing dangers therefrom with the help of the purohita and 
sacrificial priests (vide Gaut XL 15-17, Yaj 1 308 ) and he had 
to guard dharma. His secular functions included those that 
led to prosperity, that helped the people in famine and similar 
calamities, dealing even-handed justice, guarding person and 
property from thieves and trespassers and against invasion. 

The Mahabharata records the tradition that many kings of 

former times abdicated the throne in favour of their sons and 

resorted to the forest aB hermits Vanaparva 202.8 mentions 

Brhadasva who crowned his son Kuvalasva. Vide also Vayu 

88.32. Dhrtarastra says to Yudhisthira that in their family it 

was customary for kings to transfer the sovereignty to their 

sons and resort to a forest towards the close of their lives 

( Siramavasi 3.38 ). Vyasa says that that was the practice of all 

rajarm (Siramavasi 4.5) and the Ssramavasiparva (20) mentions 

the names of several such kings. Vide alBO Santi 21.15. In 

Ayodhya 23.27, 9419 this practice is referred to. ,M In the 

Raghuvarosa (I 8, XVHI. 7,9,26) Kalidaea says that in the 

family of Eaghu kings in their old age became mums ( hermits ) 

and in chap. ViiL 11-23 he draws a fine contrast between the 

lives of Aja and his father Eaghu (who had become a yaU).

Kautilya (VUL 2) speaks of a novel rule called 'dvai- 
iajya' 131 (sovereignty of two) and distinguishes it from 
'vairajya'. The Mss differ in their readings, but the reading 
given in the footnote by Dr Sham Sastri seems preferable. 
Kaut remarks "As between dvairajya and vairajya( foreign 
rule) the former perishes on account of mutual hatred and 
rivalry; but the latter according to the acanjas is enjoyed by 
foreigners as it is, when it pays attention to winning over the 
subjects; '2fo' says Kautilya 'dvairajya' (generally) exists 
between father and son or between two brothers, their welfare 
is the same and therefore by reason of the influence of amalyas 
(over the two rulers) it can last, but vauajya comes mto 
existence by being seized from another king who is living and 
therefore the (foreign ruler) thinking 'this country is not mine 
impoverishes it and carries off its wealth or treats it as a chattel 
(for sale) or when he finds that the country is disaffected 
towards him abandons it and goes away". This remarkable

desires to establish a dvairasya for the brothers Yajfiasena and 
Madhavasena on the north and south banks of the river Varada, 
who would both remain under the command of the king (Agni- 
mitra). In the Mahabharata a Bimilar rule of two brothers, 
Vinda and Anuvinda in Avanti, appears to be referred to (vide 
Udyogaparva 166, cr. ed. chap 163 ). MacCrindle in ' Invasion 
of India by Alexander' p. £96 quotes Diodorus to the effect that 
Alexander sailing up the river came to Taula (Patala?) a city 
of great note with a political constitution drawn on the same 
lines as the Spartan, for in this community the command in 
war was vested in two hereditary kings of two different houses, 
while a council of elders ruled the whole State with paramount

CHAPTER IV 

MINISTERS 

Amatya — The second of the seven elements of rajya is thB 
amaiya, which word may be translated as 'minister.' There are 
three words that are interchangeable though sometimes dis- 
tinguished, viz. amalya, saciva and mantrin, the first being the 
oldest of the three. A Karika on Panini ( IV. 2 104 ) teaches 
the formation of the word with the affix tyap ( tya ) from ama 
meaning ' near or with* ( vide Mahabhasya, vol. IL p 292 ). In 
Bg IV. 4. 1 m there is the germ of this word * O Agni 1 Go like 
a king riding an elephant, accompanied by his ministers '■ 
Yabka ( in Nirukta VI. 12 ) explains ' amavan ' as ' amatyavan,' 
though two more explanations of the word are offered by him. 
The word amatya itself occurs in Jtg. VH. 15. 3, but there it is 
an adjective and means ' our own ' or ' abiding in our house '• 
In some of the sutras like the Baudhayanapitr-medhasntia 
( 1 4. 13, 1. 12 7 ) the word amatya is used in the sense of ' near 
male relations in the house '. Vide H Dh. vol II. p. 588 n. 1375. 
The word ' amatya ' occurs in the sense of minister in Ap Dh. 
S IL 10. 25 10 "The king should not live better or more 
luxuriously than his gurus ( elders ) and his ministers ( gurun- 
amatyansca natijlvet ) ' The word * saciva ' occurs in the Ait 
Br ( XIL 9 ) where it is said that Indra considered the Maruts 
as his 'sacivas' ( helpers or comrades ). The necessity of amUtyas 
or sacivas is stated in graphic language by several wiiters 
Kautilya (17 last verse ) says ' kingship is possible only with 
( the aid of ) assistants, a single wheel cannot work ( a chariot ) , - 
therefore the king should appoint ministers and listen to their 
opinions'. Manu(VH 55 = Sukra IL 1) says 'it is difficult 
for a person single-handed to accomplish even an easy task, 
how can government particularly, which has great good as its 
aim, be accomplished without helpers'? The Matsya-purana 
(215. 2) prescribes 'the king, while his head is still wet with 
the waters of coronation, if he wants to supervise his State, 
should choose his helpers, as in the latter the kingdom secures 
stability '. Matsya 215 3 is the same as Manu VP 55 Vid e

Vjsnudharmottara II. 34. 2-3 which aro the samo as Matsya 
215. 2-3 ; also Santi 106. 11 and Rajanltiprakasa p. 174. From 
Arthasastra 1. 1 and 8, Manu VII 54 and 60, Kam. IV. 25, 27, 
XIIL 24 and 64 it appeals that they use the words saciva 
and amatya as synonyms Rudradaman in his Junagadh 
Inscription ,w (E. I. vol. VBJ. p. 36 at p. 44) states that his 
great enterprise to lepair the Sudarsana lake was disapproved of 
by his advisory ( mati-saoiva ) and executive councillors (karma- 
eaeiva) who were all endowed with the qualities required in 
amatyas and yet who were averse to the project and had no 
enthusiasm for it, since the breach to be repaired was very great 
Here saoivas are divided into two sorts, those who give advice 
and those who execute the business decided upon and the word 
saeiva seems to be a synonym of amatya. Amara" 5 states that 
the amatya who is a dhisaava ( i e matisaava ) is called a 
mantrin, while amatyas other than the mantrin »to called 
karmasacivas. 'These distinctions are often not observed. 
Sumantra is called amatya in Bamayana L 7 3 and the best of 
mantrins in 1 8. 4. In Ayodhya 112. 17 amatya and mantrin 
seem to be distinguished. From Kaut. 1 8 ( last verse ) ' Having 
divided the spheres of their powers and having taken into 
consideration the time and place and the work they have to do, 
all these persons should be appointed as ministers (amatyas), 
but not as mantrins, ' it follows that montrins were regarded by 
Kautilyaasofahigher grade than amatyas in general. The 
«. N P. p. 178 says that the amatyas are also styled mantrins 
Kautilya states ( 1 10 ) how amatyas are to be tested by upadhSs 
J. e by means of tempting them as regards each of dhai ma, 
arlha, kSma, anfrbhaya (fear) and to be employed if found honest 
after any one of the four tests, while mantnns were to be appoint- 
ed only if their integrity and loyalty were proved by all the 
teste combined TJpadha™ is defined by the NStivakySmrta 
p m as testing the mind of a person as regards dharma 
artha kama and bhaya by various devices' ( employed by secret 
agents) Kat ( 4-5 ) quoted by R.N.P.p.136 states that the 
minds of kings always go a stray on the (slightest) cause by

reason of the fact that they possess great valour, knowledge 
weaHfr and particularly the factthat they possess absolute power^ 
therefore brahmanas should always enlighten the mind of the 
king as to the duties of a king. 

About the number of members in the council of ministers 
there has been a great divergence of views from ancient times 
Kaut 1 15 and Kam. XI. 67-68 state that according to the 
Manava school the council (pansad) of ministers should be 
constituted of twelve amatyas, ace. to the Barhaspatyas of 16, 
ace to the Ausanasas of 20, but Kautilya's own opinion was 
that the number is determined by the power or exigencies of 
the State (yathasamartkyam) The Balakfinda (7 2-3) states 
that Dasaratha had 'eight honest and devoted amatyas (who 
are then named) Manu VEL 54 and Manasollasa (11 2. 
verse 57 ) require that the king should select seven or eight 
ministers who should be hereditary, versed in the sSstras, brave, 
horn of high family and well-tested. This advice was followed 
by Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, who had a council 
of eight ministers (Pradfianas). Vide Ranade's ' Rise of the 
Maratha Power * pp 125-126 where he describes the functions 
of the eight ministers called ' Mukhya-pradhana ' (Prime 
minister ) ', Pant AmStya ( Finance minister ), Pant Sachiva 
( General Accountant and Auditor ), Senapati ( Commander-in- 
chief ), Mantri ( in chaTge of king's private affairs ), Sumanta 
( Foreign Secretary ), Pandittao ( in charge of the Ecclesiastical 
Department), Eyayadhlsha (Chief Justice). This list was 
probably taken by Shivaji's advisers from the Sukranltisara 
U 71-72 where almost, the same «ight are said to be the 
ministers according to some. Vide also Grant Duff's History 
of the Marathas, vol. L p. 193, and Rao Bahadur Wad's selec- 
tions of sanaels and letters ( in Marathi ) published by Messrs. 
Mawajee and Parasnis in 1913, where the names of the eight 
ministers of Shivaji are stated and their duties are described 
( p. 123 ). In the SSntiparva ( 85. 7-9 ) it is declared that the 
king should have 37 sacivas, of whom 4 should be learned 
and bold brahmanas, 8 valiant ksatriyas, 21 prosperous 
vaisyas, 3 sudras and one sula versed in the Puranos, but 
verse 11 adds that the king should discuss^ and settle lines of 
policy in the midst of eight mantrins and Santi 83 47 says that 
mantrins should not be less than three. In the RamSyana 
( IL 100. 71 ) Rama whom Bharata came to meet in the former's 
exile asks him whether he held consultation with three or four 
mantrins and (in verse 18 = Sabhaparva 5. 30) Rama hopw 



HI ] Number of mantrins ' 107 

that Bharata did not settle his policies by himself alone or in 
consultation with, too many ministers. Kautilya also (L 15) lays 
down that the king should hold consultation with three or f out 
mantrins The Nitivakyamrta ( mantrisamuddesa pp.- 127-128) 
holds that they should bo three, live or seven, that unanimity 
is difficult to secure in a group of persons of different characters 
and that when there are many ministers they are jealous and 
try to carry out their own ideas. These passages show that 
firstly there was to be a small cabinet of three or four ministers, 
secondly there was to be a council (parisad) of ministers who 
might be eight or more in number according to requirements 
and thirdly there was a large number of amatyas or sacivas 
( high functionaries concerned with various departments ). The 
council is mentioned in the 3rd and 6th Bock Edicts of Asoka 
( Corpus 1 1 vol. L p. 4 ' parisa pi yute ajnapayisati ' ) in the words 
'the council will OTder the officers called Tuktas'. The qualifica- 
tions of ministers ( amatyas ) are laid down in several places 
e g in Kautilya 1 9, Manu VH. 54, Yaj. I 312, Kam. 17. 25-30 
(of which verses 28-30 are almost the same as the words of 
Kautilya), Santi 118 2-3 (14 qualities of mantrins are men- 
tioned), Santi 80. 25-38, Balakanda 7. 7-14, AyodhySkanda 100. 
15, Medhatithi on MamrVIL 54, Agnipurana 239. 11-15 (= Kam. 
17. 25 and 28-31), Manasollasa H 2, verses 52-59, Nltivaky- 
amrta p. 108, Bsjanltirataakara pp 13-14 ( quoting Warada and 

™ 5r «i ) * 9 ?f i ^f : ^ a PP 174 " 178 ' ^iadharmakaustubha 
TO ' f X ;f 4 ' ^^bhusana pp. 32, 57-58. Only the qualities 
required by Kautilya in amatya are set out here : He must be 
a native of the country, born of high family, influential, well- 
trained in arts, far-sighted, wise, of good memory, vigilant 

capable of endurance, pure (in mind and actions), weU-disuosed 

health, spintedness, free from arrogance and fickleness affec 
tionate who would not have recourse to-.hatred evt? when 
offended by the king). Kautilya states that ameZ a^S

Manu VU 54, Yaj I 313, R&nayana II 100 26 ( =SabMparva 
5. 43 ), Agni. 220 16-17, Sukra H 114 The Matsya 215 83-84 
and Agnipurana ( 220 16-17 ) add the very sensible remark that 
such hereditary ministers should not be allowed to dispose of 
the cases of their ddyadas (agnates) The Visnudharmottara 
(2L 24 55-56 ) contains the same rule This heieditaty character 
is borne out by many inscriptions Foi example, m the Allahabad 
stone pillar ins of Samudragupta, Harisena is himself a Maha- 
danda-nayaka whose father Dhrmrabhuti was also a Mahadanda- 
nayaka (Gupta Inscriptions pp 10,15) and in the Udayagn: 
cave Inscription of Candragupta II (ibid p 34) Virasena «, 
described as ' anvayapraptasacivya ' ( who hereditarily obtained 
the post otsaaui) The R N P (p 176) after quoting the Matsya- 
purana expressly states that the heieditary punciple was to be 
given up, if the son or giandson of a former minister had not 
the requisite qualifications, but that such a descendant was 
to be employed only in such state work as was suited to 
his " T attainments The mantrins should, according to most 
authorities, be chosen from among brahmanas, ksatfiyas and 
vaisyas, but not from sfldras, even if the latter be endowed with 
qualities ( vide Sukra H. 426-427, Nitivakyamrta p 108 ) m " 
The consultation with the council of ministers was to be in 
secret Kautilya ( I 15 ) says ' All administrative undeitaking-! 
must be preceded by consultation with ministers The place for 
consultation should be so secluded that the conveisation going 
on inside will not be heard outside and that even birds cannot 
see it, for it is narrated that secret consultations were divulged 
by parrots, manias, dogs and other lower animals ' ui The 
Harsacarita VI states that Nagasena of the Naga dynasty met 
destruction in PadmavatI because his secret policy was divulged

(=Santi. 140 24 which is also the last but one verse in Kaut. 
I 15). ,M The king presided in the council, but if he was not 
present the chief minister presided (Manu VH. 141). In the 
Malavikagnimitra(V) the king's decision to make a di-anajya 
is conveyed to the council of ministers and then the amatya 
( who here means the chief minister or President of the council ) 
informs the king that the council agreed with the king, where- 
upon the king asks the council to depute the commander-in- 
chief Virasena to carry out the proposal. Kaut further says 
( 1 15 ) that all business was to be transacted in the presence of 
the ministers ; but if any one was absent his opinion was to be 
elicited by despatching a letter. In matters of emergency ( or 
great danger ) the king is to call his cabinet ministers and the 
council of ministers and what the "majority decide ox what 
would lead to success is to be carried out by the king. Sukra 
1365 also refers to the view of the majority. It is the duty of the 
ministers, according to Kam. IV. 41-49, to prevent a king from 
pursuing an evil course, it is the duty of the king to listen 
to the advice of bis ministers and such ministers are not 
merely his friends but are really his owr'is. ,4 ° Sukra 0L 82-83)

the proper bostowal of the wealth obtained, the king is to 
ascertain tho opinions of ministers separately and then jointly 
and then do what is beneficial ; he is then to hold consultation 
on the most important affairs relating to the six means of policy

ministers and always to rely upon him, to settle all lines of 
policy finally on his advice and then to act Yaj I 312 also

ment ( i e punishing those who deserve punishment), subduing 
enemies, measures against calamities like famine, guarding the 
king and the kingdom. '" The NltivSkyamrta ( p 185 ) concisely

(Home minister), pradvivaka (minister of Justice), pandita 
(minister of ecclesiastical matters), sumantra (Finance minister), 
amatya ( revenue minister ) and duta ( minister of diplomatic 
relations ) and remarks that others omitted purodhas and duta 
from this list of ten and held that these eight should all receive 
the same pay (verses 71-72), while Sukra was of opinion that 
the ten high dignitaries should each receive in order one tenth 
more as pay than the succeeding one ( v. 71 ), that the purohita 
was the most eminent of all, that among the rest each preceding 
was more eminent than each succeeding one ( IL 74-77 ), that 
after these hign dignitaries came the other officers (adhikarigana, 
H. 279 ), that then came the darsaka ( secretary ? ), and lekhaka 
( clerk ), then the menial servants who waited on the king and 
lastly the lowest were those who carried out dirty work. In

ministers from pratinidhito data ,so and then in H 88-105 at 
length. In 1 353-361 Sukra lays down how the king's public 
durbar should he arranged, viz. the king's throne should be in 
the centre of the western half of the hall on which the king 
should sit well-dressed, wearing his crown, armour and a drawn 
sword; his sons, grandsons, brother's and sister's sons should 
sit behind him, his daughter's sons should sit on his right and 
on his left should sit in order his uncles, chief agnates, members 
of the assembly, commanders ; in front of the king to his right 
should be seated his maternal grandfather's relatives, the man- 
trins, and to the left his father-in-law, wife's brother, officers &c. 
The Sukranitisara ( I 374-376 ) lays down certain very practical 
rules for the king: 'he should personally observe villages, towns 
and districts every year; he should see whether his subjects 
are kept contented or are harassed by his officers, he should not 
side with the officers (with the man on the spot ) but rather 
should take the side of the subjects, he should remove an officer 
who is hateful to many ( lit. a hundred ) people and an amatya 
should be removed if he is found to commit several illegal acts 
Sukra (in IL 107-113) further advises the change of portfolios 
among the ministers (e. g sumantra should be appointed 
amatya or wee vensa);ha says that for each department three should 
he engaged, one the most clever being the head and two others 
being darsakas (secretaries) who should be changed every 
three, five, seven or ten years ; one man should not be allowed to 
hold the same high office for a long time, since otherwise he 
becomes intoxicated with power,'" servants should not do any 
business without a written order nor should a king order any- 
thing to be done except in writing-( IL 290 ). 

The words in Asoka's Edict HI 'paScasu paficasu vasesu

offioeTB every five years. The 6th caste mentioned by Megas- 
tlienes (Fragment 1 p. 41 and Fragment XXXIU p. 85 in 
McCrindle's 'Ancient India' ) was that of overseers who inquired 
into and superintended all that wont on in India, and made 
reports to the king or, where there was no king, to the magistrate. 
Megasthenes prohahly confounded the ministers and adhyaksas 
(who were often hereditary } with a caste. Vide also Fragment 
XXXIV pp. 86-88 about the officers of state and their duties- 
It is probably on account of some such rule as is stated in 
Sukra about frequent change of portfolios that in the inscriptions 
high functionaries have epithets prefixed to them which indicate 
their connection with several portfolios e. g. in the Banskhera 
plate of Emperor Harea ( E. L vol. IV p. 208 at p. 211 ) Skanda- 
gupta ( who is probably the same as the Skandagupta mentioned 
by Bana in theHarsacarita VI as commander of the elephant arm) 
was the dutdka of the grant and is described as ' mahapramatara- 
mahasamanta ' ; in the Allahabad stone pillar Ins. of Emperor 
Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions p. 10 and p. 15 n. 4), Harisena 
is described as ' Sandhivigrahika ' ( minister for peace and war ), 
' Kumaramatya ' (the minister of the Yuvaraja ?) and Maha-danda- 
nayaka 158 ( commander of an army ); Prthvlsena ( a brahmana ) 
is described as mantrin, kumaramatya and then mahabala- 
dhikrta ( in E. L vol X p. 72, of Gupta Samvat 117 ). In theory 
and practice the king was to issue orders in the presence or 
under the advice of his principal ministers We read in the 
grant of BajarSja I of the Eastern Calukya dynasty that he 
issued his command in the presence of the mantrin, purohita, 
senapati, yuvaraja, dauvarika and pradhana (E, I vol IV. p. 300 
at p. 302 ). Sukra ( H. 362-370 ) describes the procedure followed 
in issuing orders about State business. First the mantrin, 
pradvivaka (Chief Judge), pandita (head of ecclesiastical 
department ), and data should write out the business relating to 
their departments, then the amatya should write thereon ( sadhu 
lilchamm-asti, the writing is good), sumantra adds ' samgag 
watrOam' ( it is well considered ), the pradhSna writes ' satyam 
yathartham * (it is the truth, it is as the business requires ), 
pratinidhi should write ' anglkartum yogyam ' ( it is proper to 
accept this ), the yuvaraja should write ' anglkartavyam * ( it 
should be accepted ), the purohita should write ' lekhyam svg- 

152. ' Mahadandanayaka ' may mean ' the chief minister ' as Manu. VII 
65 states 'on the amatya depends the control (of the government) and 
discipline (among subjects) depends on control (danda).'

bhimatam * ( this writing is approved by me); all then should 
make their seals after their remarks and then the king should 
write ' anglkrtam ' ,M ( it is accepted ) and affix his seal 

The BajataranginI showB that persons often rose to ministe- 
rial positions from low birth e g. ( Y. 73 ) it states that an 
engineer of Avantivarman was a foundling, ( VH. 207 ) a watch- 
man became chief minister. 

It is necessary to say a few words about some of the great 
officers of State. First comes the Yuvaraja Kautilya devotes 
one chapter (I. 17 ) to taking care of the prince. The subjects 
of the prince's education, his association with state business, 
treatment of princes, good or bad, the coronation of a yuvaraja 
have already been dealt with (pp. 49,83' &o.). The younger 
brother or eldest son was made yuvaraja { Crown Prince ) during 
the reigning king's life ( Ayodhya, chap. 3-6, Earn. VII 6, Sukra 
II 14-16 ) Rama on his coronation as king made Bharata the 
Crown Prince when Laksmaua refused to be so,(Yuddhal31.93)- 
The yuvaraja and princes were often sent as governors of 
different parts of the realm. The Divyavad&na ( XXVL p 371 ) 
states that Asoka was sent by his father Bindusara to Taksasila 
to pacify popular disturbances and Emperor Asoka himself is 
Baid to have sent his son Kunala from Pataliputra to the same 
town to pacify the citizens that had been offended by the 
arrogance of the amntyas ( ibid pp 407-8 ) Kharavela in the 
HSthigumpha Ins ( E I. vol XX at pp. 79, 86 ) was a yuvaraja 
for nine years from his 16th to his 24th year From the 
MalavikSgnimitra we learn that while Pusyamitra was virtual 
emperor of Bharatavarsa his son Agnimitra was ruling at 
Vidisa and had the authority to divide the kingdom of Berar 
between two brothers, Yajnasena and Madhavasena The 
yuvaraja is not generally enumerated in the lists of mantrins, 
but he is one of the 18 tlrthas and from Sukra ( above p 115 ) it 
appears that he had a seal and important matters passed through 
his hands along with those of the m inisters. According ^o

HI] The Yuoaraja and the Stale 117 

Sukra (II, 12) the yuvaraja and the group of amatyas are the 
two arms or eyes of the king, but Sukra V. 17 warns the king 
against transferring all power to the Crown Prince except when 
the king is about to die. The Matsyapurana 320. 7 quoted in the 
Budhabhusana (p. 33) prescribes that the king should entrust 
to the well-disciplined prince at first unimportant offices and 
then gradually important ones. ISS If a prince was ill-behaved 
he was not to be abandoned as he would go over to the enemies 
and harm the king, but he should be kept confined in a guarded 
place ( Kara. VH 6, Budhabhusana pp 33, 35, verses 77, 93 ). 
Ab regards his emoluments he was placed on the Bame footing 
as the mantrin, purohita, senapati, the queen, the king's mother 
{ Kaut V. 3 ). What office is meant by the Kumaram&tya in 
some of the Inscriptions ( e. g. Gupta Ins. pp. 10, 50, E I vol X 
p. 72, E. I vol XL p. 83 ) is not clear. It does not probably 
mean 'a Toyal prince who was also an amatya', but rather 
some minister attached to the yuvaraja, as contradistinguished 
from rajamatya ( which office occurs in Gupta Inscriptions, p. 218) 
It appears that in ancient times provincial governors could be 
total strangers to the royal family Erom Kudradaman's 
Junagadh Ins. we learn that the governor of Surastra under 
Candragupfca Maurya was a vaHya called Pusyagupta and 
under Asoka a Yavana noble or king called Tusaspa 1ss " ( E I 
VDIp 36 at p. 43). * ' 

Next comes the purohita. In H. Dh vol 31 pp. 40 and 363 
it has been already shown how purohitas existed from the most 
ancient period of the Ugveda, how the purohita was thought to 
be_ half the soul of the king and how the co-operation of the 
spiritual teacher and the secular head (the king) was deemed 
absolutely necessary for the prosperity of the kingdom, how 
Gautama XI 12-14 ) an d £p Dh. S II 5 10. 16 prescribed the 
qualities of the purohita. Our authorities show that the purohita 

rastragopa ( the saviour of the kingdom ). The Sukranitx also ,

though a very late work, similarly describes the purohita 
( IL 74 ) as ' rajarastrabhrt ' { the /supporter of the king and the 
kingdom ) In the Rgveda HI 53. 12 we find the idea that the 
hymns and the spiritual power of the purohita Visvamitra 
protected the Bharata clan ISB He made the king ready for 
battle and accompanied him in battle murmuring ' where the 
arrows fly &c\ (Rg.V175 17) while the fight went on (videisv. 
Gr III 12 19 quoted below n. 308) The Visnudharmasutra 
III 70, Y»3 L 313, Kam. IV 32 require that the purohita was to 
be well versed ,s7 in the vedas, itihasa, dharmasastra or danda- 
nlti, in astrology and portents, in riles of propitiation contained 
in the Atharvaveda, of high family, endowed with all wdyus and 
good acts as stated in the sastras and with austerities. Kaut- 
(19) states almost the same qualifications for the purohita, 
requires the king to honour his advice as a pupil honoure his 
teacher or a son his father or a servant his master and says that 
royal power advanced by brahmanas, enforced as with a spell 
by the consultations of mantrins and endowed as with a weapon 
by the observance of sastric rules becomes invincible and 
secures success Vide Adi. 170 74-75, 174. 14-15, Santi. 72. 2-18 
and chap. 73, Kajanltiprakasa pp 59-61 and 136-137, Ksja- 
dharma-kaustubha pp 255-257 for qualifications expected in 
the purohita Kautilya (X 3) states that while a battle is 
going on the ( chief ) minister and purohita should urge on and 
encourage the soldiers by exhorting them with verses from 
the Veda and classical Sanskrit, promising great rewards in 
the next world for those who fall in battle The Sukranltisara 
( IL 78-80 ) requires in the purohita among other qualities the 
study of dhanurveda, proficiency in arms and in formations of 
armies for battle and possession of so much religious merit as 
to be able to pronounce an effective curse A purohita was to 
be distinguished from a rtmj (a sacrificial priest) as Manu 
VII 78 and Yaj I 314 show Vide Manasollasa E 2 60tp a* J.

the purohita among amatyas or mantrins (e. g. Vijfianesvara 
on Yaj. I. 353, Sukra H. 69-70 ), while others like Yaj. I 312 
regard him as distinct from mantrins. The purohita was often 
hereditary. Aco. to Kautilya quoted ahove he was to employ 
means declared in the Atharvaveda to remove calamities, divine 
and human. The great divine calamities ace. to Kautilya IV. 3 
are fire, flood, disease, famine, rats, wild elephants, snakes and 
evil spirits. liS According to Manu VII. 78 the purohita was 
concerned with the religious rites laid down in the srauta and 
grhya sutras and Ap 11 5. 10. 14-17 show that the purohita 
had complete jurisdiction in matters of penance for offences. 
Vas.(19. 40-42 ) provides that if the king lets off an offender 
deserving to be punished the king had to fast for a day and the 
purohita for three days and to perform the heavy penance of 
Ercchra if the king punished the innocent. According to most 
authorities he played a role that was pre-eminently religious 
He is not mentioned among the 10 limbs of the sabte in tho 
administration of justice. Kat. 24 (quoted in S. V. p. 20) does not 
require him to he an expert in arthasastra, though Kat 56 quoted 
by the Mit. on Yaj. H 2 and Sm. C. (II. p. 14) say that the king 
should enter the Hall of Justice with learned brahmanas, the 
ministers, the chief justice, the purohita &c. Yaj. 1. 312 and the 
Mit. on Yaj. L 312-313 on the other hand prescribe that even after 
consulting all mantrins, the king was finally to consult the 
purohita in all secular and religious matters. The Nltivakyamrta 
(purohitasamuddesa) p 160 states that the divine calamities 
are: shower of fire (fall of lightning?), excessive rainfall, 
epidemics, famine, damage or disease of crops, swarms of 
locusts and other vermin, diseases, goblins and female evil 
spirits, snakes, wild elephants, rats. The purohita is required 
to know ritual of five kinds,'" vfc that dealing with the 
propitiation of Naksatras, that of srauta sacrifices, that of the 
mmhtas ( of Tantra worship), that of Atharvasiras and that of

santis ( such as grahasanti &c. ). Calamities, according to Kam. 
XHI. 30-21, are of two sorts, divine ( daiva ) and human : there 
are five kinds of the first viz. fire, flood, disease, famine and 
epidemic, all of which can he met hy human effort and by 
propitiatory rites, while human calamities should be withstood 
by constant effort and by proper lines of policy. The same 
verses are Agnipurana 241 14-16. 

Ace to Eautilya (V 3) 48000 panas were the salary of the (royal) 
sacrificial priest, acarya (teacher), mantrin, purohita, commander- 
in-chief, crown prince, the king's mother, the queens and he holds 
that "with that amount of maintenance they would not yield to 
temptation or revolt (against the king)". 160 The am5tyas,the chief 
judge and even the purohita could be punished by the king, ace to 
Manu, if any of them went wrong (VET 335 and IX 234) and Kaut- 
( IX. 3 ) prescribes that when the purohita is guilty even of a 
great offence, the remedy is to imprison him or banish him. Some 
great ministers, though not exactly purohitas of the king, were 
learned brahmanas and led simple lives such as Canakya and 
Madhava There is divergence of views about the salaries set 
out in the Arthasastia (V. 3 ). Jayaswal ( in ' Hindu Polity ' 
part H p 136 ) holds that the salaries were yearly and the panas 
in which they weie paid were silver ones. Prof Dikshitar ( in 
' Mauryan Polity ' p 151 ) holds that the salaries were monthly 
Confusion is caused by the fact that theie weie panas of copper, 
silver and gold Vide Rajanltiprakasa p 294 The Rajatarangwl 
VII 950 speaks of dirniaias of gold, silver and copper Rao 
Bahadur K. V Rangaswami Aiyangar holds that the salaries 
( in the Arthasastra ) were monthly and in golden panas 
(in 'Ancient Indian Polity ' pp 44-45) Therefore this matter 
must be investigated Manu ( VHI 13 ) promises that those 
names of copper, silver and gold coins which are well-known 
among the people ( of its day ) for purposes of trade will be 
described hy him Aco. to Manu VUL 134 and 136, Visnu Dh 
S IV. 6-10, and Ysj I 363-365 five krsnalas are equal to a 
masa,, 16 masas are equal to a suvarna, 4 suvainas ( or five ace 
to some ) are equal to a pala, a karsa is equal to £ of a pala 
and a piece of copper one-fourth of a pala in weight is called a 
pana, which is the same as karsapana '" ( equal to 80 rahtikas m

gufija berries). A pala was equal to 320 raktikas. Kant H.19 Bays 
practically the same thing. In Kant. V. 3 the salaries range from 
48000 to 60 panas from the highest functionaries to the lowest 
servants. They must all be taken to be for the same period in every 
case and in the same metal, Bince Kaut expressly states no different 
periodB and no difference in metal. Ordinarily the words pana 
and karsapana ( as stated by Manu VDI 136 and the Mit. on 
Y&j. L 365 and the Sukranlti IV. 1. 116 ) refer to copper piecos 
(usedaB coins) and bearing a stamp. Another table given 
hy Manu VUL 135-136, Visnu Dh. S. VI. 11-12, Yfij. L 364 is : 
2 raktikas us or krsnalas = one (silver) masa, 16 maaas=onc 

162. A rakhka was found by General Cunningham nfter many experi- 
ments to weigh on an average 1.8 grams (\idehis * Coins of Ancient India ' 
pp 45-46 and also Rapson's " Coins ' pp. 2-3 ) So that a silver dbarana or 
purana ( of 32 raktikas ) should weigh about 57. 6 grams and a copper pana 
(of 80 raktikas) should weigh 144 grains It appears that the weights of 
Indian coins in different parts and at different times varied a good deal. 
Cunningham ( ' Cows of Ancient India ' p. 5 ) stales that gold was cheap in 
India, being as one to eight rates of silver. But in medieval times i. e. 
about 1300 A. D. (vide Sukra IV. 2 92-93 ) gold was 16 times the price of 
the same weight of silver, which again was 80 times of the price of the same 
weight of copper. Though, as stated in note 161 above, a copper pana was 
usually equal to eighty raktikas, a copper pana of 100 raktikas (.. c of 20 
masas J was known. Nar. (pansista verse 58) speaks of masa as the 20th part 
of the karsapana and the Mit on YaJ. I 365 and Vy Nirnaya p 207 quote 
a verse (attributed to TJsanas by Haradatta and Maskann on Gaut. XII 19) 
that a masa is a twentieth part of pana ( wn f, K^W, m qo,^ uffcftfc,. ).

in the Gupta year 93 and pp 38, 41, 261 (where it is stated that one bhtkstt 
was to be fed every day throughout the year from the permanent endowment 
of 12 dinaras). From the Baigram plate dated Gupta samvat 128 it appears 
that one dinara was equal to 16 rupakas ( silver coins ) in E I vol XXI. 
p 80. A M&thura Ins of the 28th year of Huviska speaks of the deposit of 550 
puranas ( E. I. vol XXI p. 55 at 61). Bhaskaracarya ( who was born in sake 
1036 and wrote his Siddhantas'iromam in 1072 sake i e 1150 A. D ) gives 
the following table (in Lllavati I 2-4}* 20 varatakas «= kakini, 4 kakinls =

called Snvarna, It will be seen that Mar. and Lilavati differ as to *lWi<n! 
Gadyanakas of gold are referred to in the Fattadakal pillar Ins of Kirtivar- 
man I (754 A. D.) where it is stated that a field of 30 ntvartanas was 
purchased for thirty gadyanakas of gold (E I vol III. pp 6-7) From a 
verse of the Caturvimsatimata quoted by the Mit on Y5j III 258 it appears 
that gadyanaka was also a silver coin. From an inscription of Vikramaditya 
V near Gadag dated sake 934 it appears that fines for offences were levied 
in gadyanakas (E I vol. XX p 64) The following works may be consulted

iabh&go dharanam). NSrada (parisista 57) expressly Btates 
thatasilverkarsapanaisin vogue in the south i. e. a silver 
pana or karsapana was not universal. m A golden suvarna also 
comprised 80 gufijas, while the standard sUvor pana was of 32. 
Bhys Davids ( in * Buddhist India ' p. 100 ) states that about the 
time of Buddha's birth transactions were carried on in terms of 
the kcHinjxma, a square copper coin weighing about 144 grainB 
and guaranteed as to weight and fineness by punch marks made 
by private individuals, that there were half and quarter kaha- 
panas also, that a kahapana would be now worth about $ths of a 
penny, though its purchasing power was then equal to about 
one shilling of the present day. Therefore it is proper to under- 
stand that a pana or kSrsapana, when the word is used without 
any qualification, was meant to be one of copper and that 
prima faae the salaries in Kautilya were meant to be in copper 
panas This conclusion can be supported by various considera- 
tions Manu YH. 126 prescribes that the wages for the lowest 
menial servant ( such as one who sweeps the house or brings 
water ) is one pana a day and of a superior menial servant 
6 panas a day and that the former was to get in addition one 
pair of garments every six months and every month a drona 
of corn ( which would be equal to 1024 musUs according to the 
Mit. on Yaj BX 274 ). Whatever ages may be assigned to the 
AithaSastra and the present Manusmrti the two works cannot 
be separated from each other, if at all, by more than a century 
or two. Therefore the economic conditions of the one may be 
held to have not differed much from those to which the other 
refers. It is impossible to hold that the lowest menial servant 
got one gold papa a day besides over 30 mustis of corn every 
day (1024 in a month). If that were so, the lowest menial servants 
of Kautilya's days would have to bB supposed to be a hundred 
times better off than their confreres in big cities like Bombay 
towards the end of the 19th century { when menial servants got 
from five to ten rupees a month without any allowance of grain ), 
Therefore the pana in Kautilya V. 3 is not of gold. Kautilya 
{ in V. 3 ) says that a king who has a depleted treasury may 
make payment of salary by giving forest produce, cattle or 
fields along with small quantities of cash, that if he has under- 
taken to colonize a waste tract he may make payment of salary 
in cash only and not by bestowing a village. In connection

with this he says that 60 panas are to ba the equivalent of one 
adhaka of corn ( sastivetanasyadhakam krfcva hiranyanurupam

( handfuls ) of corn and even in famine times one adhaka could 
not have cost 60 silver panas, much less golden ones In V. 3 
Kautilya declares that an ordinary duta should get ten panas 
for a journey of one yojana and twice the wages for eaoh yojana 
up to one Hundred. A yojana aco to Kaut. himself (JJ. 20) is 
equal to 8000 dhanus ( ace to another reading 4000 dhanus ), a 
dhanus being equal to four aratnis (each aratni being 
24 angulas ). So taking the highest figure a yojana was at the 



164 The word hiranya has two senses 'gold' and ' money or ' cash ' 
whether in gold, silver or copper (as said by Amara who gives 'dravina'as 
a synonym ) When Kautilya says that the Icing may pay ' hiranya ' and not 
' grama ' he means only cash payment and not necessarily only gold ■ 
vide the copperplate grant of Siliditya VII m Gupta Inscriptions p 179 at 
p 189 where the grant of a village is said to be ' sadhanyahiranyadeyah ' 
Here dhattya (payment of tax in kind) is contradistinguished from payment 
to hiranya i e in cash ( either gold, silver or copper). When Pataujali 
states that the Mauryas being greedy of ' hiranya ' founded or manufactured 
images (Mababhasya vol II p. 429 on FSn V 3 99 quoted in H Dh 
vol lip 710 n 1696) what is meant is that they wanted cash and sot 
merely gold, . 

165 The measures of capacity such as sns^Ti UW occur in the Mat- 
hura Ins of Huviska ( E I XXI p 55 at p. 61 ) According to Farasara 
(VI 70 ) two prasthas are equal to an adhaka and 32 prasthas are equal to 
a drona The Mit on Yaj III 275 quotes a verse lo this effect 8 mastis = 
one ktHcit or kttilct (ace to some ), 8 kiiicit = puskala, 4 puskalas = adhaka; 
4 adhakas = drona and 16 dronas = khari Apararka (pp 305 and 846) 
quotes two verses (which the Par. M II 1 p 141 ascribes to the Bhavlsya. 
purSna) which say 2 palas=prasrti, 2 prasrtis=kudava, 4kndavas=praslh3 1 
4 prasthas = adhaka, 4 adhakas = drona, 2 dronas = kumbha The Damla 
viveka p. 135 refers to this, adds that some held the kumbha to be equal to 
20 dronas ( Kaut II 20 holds kumbha to be equal to 20 dronas ) and quotes 
the following verse from 'qo3«qT ' JgSTren S^Soir: »R«JrS3JTsmnJtrr: STO I

most about 9 or 10 miles ( or only ih or five miles according to 
tlie other reading). To hold that 10 silver panas were allowed 
to an ordinary data for going oven ten miles (which he could 
cover in half a day or less ) would be too much. Hence also 
the panas in Kaut. V. 3 are only copper ones. When once it is 
settled that the panas are of copper, it easily follows that the 
salaries in panas were monthly. Artisans and craftsmen wore, ace. 
to Kaut., to get 120 panas. If this were yearly, they would get only 
10 panas a month, while, according to Manu quoted above, even 
the lowest menial was to get a pana a day. Therefore 120 panas 
( of copper ) were the monthly salary of an artisan. A monthly 
Balary is more natural and practical than a yearly one. Other 
ancient writers like Sankha-Likhita ( in R&janltiprak&sa p. 252 ) 
contemplate a monthly salary for soldiers (viz. two suvaT nas a 
month ). " 6 From the Nasik Inscription Wo. 12 ( E. I. Vol. VUL

A few words may be said about words like suvarna, satamana, niska 
&c. The word krsnala occurs in the Tai S II 3. 2 1. Hiranyakara 
( goldsmith ) is found in V5j S 30 17. In Rg I. 126 2 gifts of a hundred 
niskas and horses are mentioned and in Kg IV 37 4 the Rbhus are address, 
ed as wearing ' good niskas ■ In Atharva V. 14 3 • niska ' occurs and in 
the Ait. Br (39 8 ) damsels who are mskakantliyah ( whose necks are adorn- 
ed with necklaces of niskas ) are among the gifts So ' niska ' was probably 
a gold piece used as a coin or an ornament or a thin plate of gold like a 
modern fmth, several of which are even now worn by women in the form 
of a necklace In Rg II 33 10 Rudra is said to wear ■ visvarupa-mska ' 
which is probably an allusion to golden pieces stamped with various figures. 
In Rg VI 47 23 the sage says that he received ten 'hiranyapindas' (golden 
pieces ) from Divodasa In Rg VIII. 78 2 a prayer is offered to Indra for the 
bestowal of golden ' mana\ which may be the precursor of "Satamana".

karsapanas were equal to one suvarna. 

Hopkins in 'Position of the ruling caste' J. A. 0. S. 
vol. XHL pp. 151-162 traces how the influence of the purohita 
grew. One cannot accept his views ahout there heing three 
layers in the Mahabharata and the conclusions from such 
dealing with the text that he draws, which are rather subjective. 
Gradually the importance of the purohita waned As the 
Sukranltisara cited above ( n 150.) shows, long before that work 
he came to be omitted by several writers from the council of 
ministers and was supplanted by the Pandita. The same func- 
tions came to be exercised by an officer called dharmadhyaksa 
or dharmadhikaranika in Bengal and other countries The 
Matsyapurana ( 215. 24 ) states the qualifications of a dharmmlh- 
kann. m Vide E L vol. 14 p. 156 at p. 160 of the Naihati 
grant of Ballalasena, where we have both purohita and maha- 
dharmadhyaksa mentioned among the great functionaries of Slate 
and the Benares copper-plate of the Cedi king Karnadeva in 1042 
A D. in E I vol H. p 309 where we have mahadbarmadhi- 
karanika but no purohita. Besides another officer called 
samvatsara (astrologer) gradually took over some of the 
functions of the purohita. The Visnudharmasutra BL 75 ( riyS 
ca sarvalmyesu safovatsarudhiimh syat) requires the king to depend 
on the samvatsara in all matters. The Brhat-samhita (2.9) 
states that a king without a samvatsara mistakes his path like a 
blind man. Kam. 4.33 and Visnudharmottara B. 4. 5-16 recom- 
mend reliance on him. Kautilya I6T » IX. 4 was himself against 
too much reliance on astrology, while Taj. T 307 holds that the 
rise and fall of kings depend on the (aspects or influence 
of ) planets.

that a ksatriya should be preferred as senapati, hut if a valiant 
ksatriya be not available a hrahmana may be chosen, but a 
sudra should not be chosen. Ace. to the Manasollasa he should 
possess the following qualities: good family, character, 
courage, profioiency in (several) languages, cleverness in 
riding horses and elephants and in the science of arms, 
knowledge of omens and medicine, knowledge of the breeds of 
horses and of the difference between what is essential and non- 
essential, liberality, sweet speech, self-control, intelligence, 
resoluteness. In the MababhSrata genapatis are elected and 
consecrated (vide Udyoga 151, Drona 5, KarnalO), but this 
was not so in later times. He is appointed by the king on his 
own initiative.

policy has been settled at a council of ministers to the king 
who is to be attacked (vide Kam. Xlllalso). A data is of 
three kinds : (1) nisrstartha ,M ( one to whom is entrusted full 
discretion as to what is to be said ) is one who is possessed of 
the qualifications required in a minister (amatya ), such as Krsna 
from the Pandavas or the ambassadors in modern times; 
(2) panmitartha ( entrusted with a definite mission, an envoy ) 
who possesses the same qualifications as the first less by one 
quarter; (3) iasanahara (a mere carrier of royal writings or 
missives ) who possesses only half the qualifications of the first. 
The Mit. on Yaj. I 328 lucidly explains the three varieties. 
Kaut. dilates at great length on the qualifications of the data, 
what he has to note while in the enemy country, how he is to 
behave ( such as avoiding women and wine ), how he is to gather 
information through spies ; but all this has to be passed over 
for want of space. Vide Kam XII 2-24 for the same. Kam. 
(XII. 22-23) briefly sets out the following dutieB of the data ; 
determining those who are inimical to the king to whom he is 
sent, winning over to Mb side the friends and relatives of the 
enemy king, finding out the ( number and equipment of) forts, 
the economic resources and military strength of the enemy 
king, collection of news as to what the enemy intends to do, 
bringing over to his side the officers in charge of the districts 
of enemy country, collecting knowledge about the places of the 
enemy where battles can be waged by his king or whence he 
can pass away swiftly. Manu VTL 65 says that it is the duta 
who brings about alliance or war. Kaut. says that when the 
ruler to whom the duta is accredited becomes displeased at the 
mess-age he brings, the duta should reply' 70 'All kings, you 
and others, speak through their duta. Therefore dutas have to 
deliver the message entrusted to them even if weapons are 
raised ( to threaten them ) ; even the lowest caste dutas (candalas) 
are not to be killed, what need be said about a da ta who is a

brahmana ? This ( that I uttm ) is the message of another. It 
is my duty to say it \ The Ramayana ( V. 52. 14-15 ) says that 
good men do not allow the killing of a duta, hut certain modes 
of dealing with him ( viz lashing him, shaving his head ) are 
allowed in certain cases. 

A duta is to be distinguished from a caia or ca>a ( spy ), as 
done by Kaut , Earn. XH 32, Yaj. I. 328. Kam. XH. 32 says 
that a duta is an open ( praka&a ) spy, while a cava is a spy who 
works in secret In modern times also ' an ambassador is often 
nothing more than an honourable spy acting under the protect- 
ion of the law of nations' ( Encyclopedia Britannica on 
' espionage ' }. Kaut. devotes four chapters to spies { 1. 11-14 ) 
and Kam. ( XII. 25-49 ) also deals at great length with them. 
The Sukranttisara ( I 334-336 ) states that the king should learn 
every day at night from his secret spies the intentions and 
actions of his subjects and officers, and the opinions of ministers, 
enemies, soldiers, the members of the assembly, relations and 
the women in the harem The cam must, according to Kam. XII. 
25, possess ability to infer the inner thoughts ( of men ), must 
have a good memory, must he soft in speech, have quick gait, he 
capable of enduring privations and heavy labour, swift in action, 
ready-witted. Kaut. (111) says"' that spies are those who 
work in the guise of a kapattka ( a hold pupil capable of know- 
ing the minds of others ), ttdSstfttta ( a sham ascetic, who has 
fallen from the real duties of asceticism and is endowed with 
intelligence and pure character), grhapalika (a householder 
who is a cultivator that has not the means to maintain himself 
has intelligence and is of pure character ), a uudehaha ( a trader 
who cannot maintain himself by trade and is possessed of intel- 
ligence and pure character ), a tapasa (a spy practising auste- 
rities, who has either shaved his head or has matted hair and is 
desirous to maintain himself ), a class-mate or colleague (satlnn)

or institutions ), which should be honoured by the king with 
awards of money and marks of respect and through which the 
king is to test the purity of the character of his servants. 
Kautilya Bays that the spy called udBsthila should carry on 
agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade on land set apart for the 
purpose, should be supplied with plenty of gold and disciples 
and should afford to all ( sham ) ascetics food, clothing and lodg- 
ing, direct them to detect particular crimes and report. The spy 
called tfiixtsa was to stay near the capital, to have many pupils, 
to pretend to oat once in a month or two only a handful of 
vegetables or grass and eat secretly his favourite dishes His 
disciples were to proclaim that he possessed supernatural powers, 
he should pretend to make predictions about gain or fires or 
fear from robbers after ascertaining from his pupils by nods and 
signs such events In 1 12 Kaut. deals with wandering spies 
( called saficara ) viz. sattrms ( who are orphans that are to be 
maintained by the State and that are taught palmistry, sorceryi 
tricks of legerdemain &c ), ttkqna (desperadoes who, regardless of 
their lives, may fight elephants for money), rasada ( who have no 
affection even for their relatives, are indolent and cruel), bhk^ukl 
or parivriijika (a poor brahmana widow, clever and desirous to earn 
her livelihood, honoured in the king's harem and visiting the 
families of mahamatras or high ministers ). These are to spy on 
the 18 tirthas ( mentioned on p 112 above ) in public For spying 
on their private character persons pretending to be hump-baoked, 
dwarfs, kiratas (pigmies), the deaf and dumb, idiots, the blind, and 
others that are actors, dancers, singers and the like and women 
are to be employed This information is to be tested by the persons 
belonging to the five samsfchas ( mentioned above on p 129). mm 
these are to act without their being known by thewandermg 
spies and vice vetsa Then further testing by other spies follows 
When the information leceived from these three sources taUies 
then it will be held reliable; if the information frequency 
Sagrees,,the spies should be secretly punished or discharge^

bring round the discontented by conciliation, gifts, sowing 
dissensions among them or by punishing them. In. 1 14 Kautilya 
deals with the employment of spies for taking advantage of 
parties in a foreign State i. e groups of persons angry with the 
toeign king or afraid of him or of persons who are ambitious 
or proud, who are to be won over by appropriate words and 
stimuli. It will be seen how there was a network of spies of all 
kinds, so much so that Kam. XII. 28 declares that spies are the 
king's eyes {caracaktur inahTjxthh). The Visnudharmottara 
H24.63 says the same {'ia}Una&-cU.7acak$uf,uh ') and also Udyoga 
34. 34 ' carmh jxdyavti rajanah '. In IV. 4-6 Kautilya dilates ,7S 
upon the employment by the samahartr ( Collector ) of a host of 
spies for suppressing those who are thorns ( or disturbers of 
peace ), these being employed for detecting judges ( dharmastha ) 
and superintendents of various departments that take bribes 
counterfeiters of coin?, adulterers, thieves and robbers and other 
criminals. Kautilya relies in extreme cases on spies even in the 
decision of judicial matters. He says ( HI. 1 last verse ) ' when 
owing to the depositions of witnesses the plaintiff's case and the 
defendant's case are both destroyed, when the cause of either of 
the parties is found through the spies to be false, then the decree 
shall be passed against that party'. 178 In Dronaparva 75. 4 it is 
said that Krsna had his spies in the army of Duryodhana and vice 
MWC74. 1). Santi69. 8-12 and 140. 39-42 mention the places where 
spies ate to be set" 4 up and emphasizes that they should not know 
each ether. One need not feel surprised at the machinery of espion- 
age that Kautilya so elaborately describes. All governments 
wi modern time B employ spies, informers and secret agents to 
fceep themselves informed of the activities, views and resources 
of their opponents. We know also how the Indian Police in 
order to catch offenders against the Prevention of Gambling 
Act or other similar Acts, employ agents with marked coins or 
notes and draw in their net unsuspecting people

CHAPTER V 
RASTRA (THE TERRITORY OF A STATE) 

The word 'rastra' occurs even in the Bgveda (IV. 42.1, 'mama 
dvifca rastram ksatriyasya')- mine is the kingdom on both sides (or 
in hoth spheres)' sayB king Trasadasyu In Rg VIL 34 11 Varuna 
is praised as the Lord of raatras (raja rastranam &c.) In 
Rg. VIL 84 2 and X 109. 3 the word rastra occurs In a very 
famous benedictory l7S passage of the Tai. S VU 5. 18 1( = Vaj 
S. 22 22 ) one of the blessings invoked is ' may the king in this 
kingdom become brave, a skilled archer, and a great warrior ' 
Vide Tai. Br in 8 13 for explanation of the Tai. S. passage 
In the Atharvaveda XII, 1 8 and 10 the earth is called mother 
and invoked to impart to the rastra strength and brilliance ( or 
energy ). Earn VI 3 says m " that sinoe all the elements of the 
State spring from the territory of the State, the king should 
raise up his territory with all his efforts. The Agnipurana 239. 2

the king depends for its prosperity on the qualities of the soil, 
the prosperity of the territory tends to the prosperity of the 
king; therefore a king should choose for the sake of his 
prosperity land possessing good qualities. That land is prefer- 
red for the sake of prosperity that is endowed with various 
crops and minerals, is Mi of merchandise, mines and various 
substances, that is favourable to cattle-rearing, that abounds 
in water, is inhabited by well-conducted people, is charming, 
has forests and elephants, has facilities of water and road 
transport and does not depend upon rain-water only.' m Land 
that is Ml of gravel and stones, Ml of forests always infested 
with thieves, that is waterless, full of thorny bushes and snakes 
is not fit for choosing as a rastia. A country is to he preferred 
that yields livelihood easily, is possessed of the qualities of 
good land { cited above ), is Ml of water, that has hills in it, 
that consists mostly of sfldras, artisans and merchants, the 
husbandmen in which undertake great projects, that is loyal 
( to the king ) and averse to the king's enemy, that can put up 
with troubles and taxes, that is large in extent, full of people 
from various countries, that follows the right path, that 
possesses plenty of cattle and wealth, the principal men in 
which are not foolish nor vicious. These requirements show 
tnat the country must he prosperous, well-stocked with the

Bjifca ( Vffl. 7. 29 ), Rusama ( V. 30 13 ), Vetasu ( X. 49. 4 ) . In

(Jandhari, Aiiga, Magadha ( in v. 14 ) deserve notice. The Ait 
Br. (38. 3) divides India into five divisions in the east south, 
west and north ( the Uttara Kurus and Uttara Madras } and 
in the centre ( Kuru-Pa5cala and Vasa-Usfnara ) India was 
divided into two parts, Daksinapatha (from the Narmada 
southwards) and Uttarapatha at least some centuiies before 
Qirist, since the Hathigumpha Ins. ( E. L vol 20 at p 79 ) 
mentions a great many kings of Uttarapatha and the Maha- 
bhasya refers to lakes in Daksinapatha."' In the Brahmana* 
frequent mention is made of the Kuru-Paiical&s (Tai Br. 
18. 4),Uttaralmru 1 Uttara-madra,Kuru-Pancalas ) Vasa-U3inaras 
(in Ait Br. 38 3), Kuru-Pancalas, Anga-Magadhas, Kssi-Kosalas 
Salva-Matsyas, Vasa-UslnaTas in Gopatha U. 10 ( ed by Gastra ). 
The GandMras occur in CMndogya Up. (VI 14 l), Videha 
in Br. Up. BI 1. 1, Madras in Br.Up. B3 3 1 In the Maha- 
btarata there are long lists of countries in various connections, 
which are more than 200 ( e g. Sabha 4 21-32, 20 26-30 Sabha'

The BaudMyana-grhyasesasutra 1 17 prescribes a mandala for 
the worship of the Sun and names nine countries in the eight

hardly taken root. Writers speak of rajya ( State ) and of iSsfca 
(territory) as an element of rajya They had no sense ol 
nationality nor did they seriously work for national unity i» 
modern idea of a nation is more a question of feeling and senti-

lands of mlecclw. Vide H. of Db. vol. II. pp. U-18. The ^Visnu 
m. 3 1-3) Maikandeya (55. 21) and other pxiranas wax eloquent 
over the importance of Bharatavarsa and describe it as the land 
of action for those who want to secure heaven or final release or 
as the land where alone sin and religious merit were to be found 
( Itarrmbhnmir-iyam smrgam-apavargam ca gacchatam or t at-karma* 
hMmr-rianyatra samp nptih pmiT/apapat/ofc in Mark ) Manu (31 20) 
manifests great pride in and love for the holy countries of 
BrahmSvarta, Kuruksetra, Matsya, Paficala and Surasena by 
glorifying the brShmanas of these countries aB those ' from whom 
all men on this broad earth should learn the actions and usages 
appropriate to them '. Vas. L 10 also says the same. Sankha- 
Likhita ( q. by Visvarfipa on Yaj 1. 2 ) hold that the country of 
Iryavarta is endowed with high qualities, is ancient and holy 

{Ma Ar\)o guvavan sawlanah piwyah). As however the 

smrtis were composed at different times, embodied the usages 
of different provinces in India and as they provided for the 
observances of all those who followed the Veda, they do not 
generally lay emphasis on localities but rather on what they 
thought was common to all S.ryas in India {yat tu samunam 
tadvakgyUmh, as iLsv. gr. says). There was no doubt a great 
emotional regard for Bharatavarsa or Sryavarta as a unity for 
many centuries among all writers from a religious point of 
view, though not from a political standpoint Therefore one 
element of modern nationhood viz. being under the same 
government was wanting. But it must be noted that from very 
ancient times there was always the aspiration among great 
kings and the people to bring the whole of Bharatavarsa " under 
one umbrella". Even in the West the sentiment of nationality 
practically arose after the partition of Poland, and as a conse- 
quence of the French Revolution and of the Industrial revolution, 
which led manufacturing countries to search for markets and 
to exploit backward and less developed peoples. Vide Laski's 
'Grammar of Polities' chap VI Modern nationalism un- 
doubtedly leads to great self-sacrifice and produces certain 
virtues of high value in the individuals that are fired by that 
sentiment. But the ideals of the modern nation States are not 
high, particularly in their treatment of other peoples and in 
their attitude towards less favoured States. The one aim of the 
leading politicians of modern nation States and most of the 
inhabitants of these States seems to be to raise the standard of

modern nation States do not deserve to survive, unless the so' 

called progressive nation States are prepared to give up their 

racial pride, their spirit of grabbing and exploitation and to 

extend a brotherly hand to all straggling States to improve 

themselves in their own way and attain to higher standards of 

living without let or hindrance. It cannot be gainsaid that 

for several centuries in the past and also at the present moment 

all modern nation States have two moralities, one for then- own 

nation and the other for then- dealings with foreign States 

and racos. 

Some remarks must now be made about provincial and 
Iooal administration Each kingdom comprised debit (countries) 
and subdivisions of desas. The governor of a rastra was called 
rastrapati or rastnya Vide p 117 above about Pusyagupta hav- 
ing been the rastriya of Surastra (Kathiawad) under Candragupta 
Maurya and Santi 85. 12 ( which describes what the rastnya 
is to do }. 

According to the Amarakosa the words desa, rastra, visaya 
and janapada are synonyms Epigraphic usage is not uniform 
about the dimensions of these. Sometimes vibaya appears to be a 
sub-division of desa (vide the woids ' rastrapati-visayapati- 
gramakQta ' in I A. vol. VHI. at p. 20 in the grant of Galukya 
Tribhuvanamalla in sake 999 and I A, vol XII pp 247, 251 m the 
grant of Kastrakuta Govmda in sake 855). But in the Hirahada- 
galli plates (E I vol I p. 5) 'visaya' occurs first and then ' rastra ', 
so it appears that there ' visaya ' is deemed to be larger than 
rastra According to the Sahyadriklianda ( uttarardba, chap 4 ) 
desa is made up of 100 villages, mandala is made up of 4 desas, 
a khanda of 100 mandalas and the earth has nine khandas K " 
From the Cambay plate of sake 852 ( 930 A D. ), we see that 
mandala was a sub-division of desa (E I. vol. 7 p 26, at p 40) From

the Bangarh grant of MahSpala I ( E. I. vol. 14 p. 324 ) and the 
Amgachhi plate of Vigrahapala, HI we see that mandala was 
smaller than visaya which again wa<j a subdivision of ' bhukti '. 
The word ' bhoga ' ( which is similar in origin to ' bhukti ' ) 
appears to be applied to a sub-division of vfeaya (which 
in its turn is a sub-division of rastra) in the Bhamdak 181 
plate of Krsnaraja I dated sake 694 ( E. L 14 p. 121, 126 ) and 
also in the Jejuri plates of Vinayaditya in 609 sake ( E, I. vol. 19 
p 62 at p. 64 where the woid ' rastrapati * does not occur ). The 
Mitaksara on Yaj. L 319 explains that only a king ( mahlpati ) 
can make a grant of land and not a bhogapati ( i. e. the officer 
over a bhoga) Another ancient word for a division of a country 
is a/mm which occurs in the Eupnath Eock insciiption and 
Sarnath pillar Edict of Asoka ( Corpus I. I. vol. I pp. 162 and 
166 ), in the Nasik Inscriptions No. 3 and 12 ( Govardhanahara

140 History of Dharwaiastra [ v j_ 

Kautilya H. 1 says that in the kingdom groups of villages 
should be set up with a chief town or fort in each, a group of 
ten villages being called Sangrahana, of two hundred villages 
being called Kharvatika, of 400 villages being called Drona- 
mukha, and in the midst of 800 villages Ma there is the Sthaniya- 

SWHHWIftfur flW^oi Wmqr l snfaeqr II. 1 Vide Dr Shamsastri's note 
on these wiifiit lias a similarity in sound and meaning to modern thmia, 
Dr. PrSn Nath (in 'Study of the economic condition of Ancient India ' 
p 26 ) principally relying on a commentator of the Jain work called 
Prajfiapanopanga ( winch he misunderstands) holds that -grama* does not 
mean 'a village', but "an estate or survey village which can pay 18 kinds 
of Government taxes ' The learned Doctor says that he consulted many 
Sanskrit lexicons, but did not find this interpretation in any one of them 
That should have induced him to be cautions But he makes the bold and 
facile assumption that ■ Ieucons were compiled from a literary viewpoint 
and are not of much assistance as far as the technical meanings of words 
are concerned'. His great authority, the Jain commentator, says ' JimfjjTOB 
gww^J^ff ffa s^t3N5orrf?tii* am* vi% *t vrv. ■a nw Rlgi ' w w rj w 
Wiriih'S' STO! 1 . Dr Pr5n Nath's Jain authority is no better than 
lexicographers and their commentators. $ftaf*r*fr on Amara derives grama 
as ' JTWff >frPlf^afe: ' i e the \iord aw is derived from the root jrg. Tie 
Jam commentator first derives the word srm from srg; and then from 175 
Dr. Pran Nath forgets that a fanciful or scholastic derivation is not a 
definition. The rest of the reasoning on the new meaning ol grama is on a 
par with this and cannot be examined in detail A commentator expressly 
states (tbtdp 27) that he gives only the vyutpattt (etymology) of grama, 
but Dr Pran Nath pays no heed to this He has not correctly grasped the 
scholastic discussion in the commentary quoted on p 27. He misunder- 
stands the word ' samagramah ' in Yaj II 152. The Amarakosa expressly 
says that ' sama ' and ' samana ' are synonyms He is often very dogmatic 
without looking into all ancient and medieval authorities e g on p 51 
he charges Dr. Fleet with misinterpretation of a Jataka text ( addba-tiyam 
satani ) which Dr Fleet translated as 250, while Dr Pran Math is sure that 
the meaning is * 150 ' He probably never noticed that so far back as the 
2nd century B c the Mahabhasya had explained the word ' ardhatrtiya ' as 
Dr Fleet does ( SIS' g^rTWrf or 3|if f3tTR?r=njr , vide Kielhorn, vol I p 426 
00 vartika 22 on Pan II 2. 24) There is hardly any warrant for Dr Prin 
Nath's assertion that each grama (as interpreted by him) contained only about 
five families and had only about 15 or 20 acres of cropped area 
(pp; 39-40). Kaut (note 178) states that a grama contains from 100 
to 500 families If the inscriptions so far published are carefully 
searched it will be found that grama ordinarily meant a village in the 
modern sense and included several hundred acres of land For example, 
in a grant of Pallava Yuvamaharaja Visnugopavarman (I. A vol Vp 50) 

(Cottttttued on the next fage)

Manu VIL 114 similarly observes that in the midst of two, 
three or five •villages the king should place a central post of 
guards called ' gulma ' and another called ' sangraha ' in the 
midst of a hundred villages. Manu VIL 115-117, Visnudharma- 
sutra HL 7-14, Santi 87 3ff, Agnipurana 223, 1-4, Visnudharmot- 
tara II. 61. 1-6, Manasollasa II. 2. 159-163 (p. 43) require the 
king to appoint a hierarchy of officers for one village, for 
groups of ten, twenty, hundred and thousand villages, who are 
to report what is wrong within their jurisdictions that they 
cannot themselves Temedy to the officer next in grade above 
themselves and Manu VIL 120 prescribes that a minister of the 
king should supervise the doings and conflicts of all these 
officers. The Edicts of Asoka show that he had to employ a 
hierarchy of officers such as the mahamatras, the yuktas and 
rajukas f or the administration of his vast empire. A. similar 
administrative system seems to have been continued under the 
Gupta Emperors From the Damodarpur, Baigram and other 
Plates (E I XV. p 113, E L XVH. pp" 345ff, E I. XXI. p 78 ) 
it appears that the Provincial Governors were appointed by the 
Gupta Emperor himself and were called upanka maharaja, that 
either the Governors or Emperors appointed District officers 
(visayapati) who were often called KumSramatya, that the District 
officers were aided in their administrative work by a board 
of four advisers called nagara-sresthin (banker), sarthavaha (chief 
merchant), prathamakulika (chief of craft guilds) and prathama- 
kayastha (chief secretary), that the District officer had his

offices or courts ( adhikaranas ), and that in sales of lands 
revenue officers called pustapulas (keepers of records of 
rights) were consulted and had to report In E L vol, 
XVII pp 345, 348 a copperplate of Kumaragupta I has 
' gramasta-kuladhikaranam ' which means an office having 
jurisdiction over 8 villages. Manu V3I. 119 says that the 
officer over 10 villages was to have as his salary a kula of 
land and kula is here said to mean (hy Kulluka) as much land as 
ib ploughed hy two ploughs having six oxen yoked to each 
The Varjayantl on Visnu Dh. S. HI. 15 says ' kulam haladvaya- 
karsanlya hhfih '. Sukra (I. 191-192) states that the lord of 
one hundred giamas is called samanta, an officer appointed by a 
king over one hundred villages is called anusamanta, one over 
ten villages is called nayaka ( compare modern ' naik ' ) Manu 
VJL 61 and 81, Yaj L 322, Kam V. 75, Visnudharmasutra EI 
16-21, Visnudharmottara 11 24 48-49 say that the king should 
appoint as many adhyakqas ( superintendents ) as are required 
for the several departments of the state, who are clever, honest 
and of good family. Kautilya " ! IL-9 prescribes ' those who are 
possessed of the qualifications for amatyas ( cited on p. 107 above ) 
should be appointed, according to their abilities, as superinten- 
dents of the various departments and the king should constantly 
examine theii work, since men are naturally fickle-minded and 
when appointed to do work exhibit like horses change of temper '. 
It is pointed out in works like the Visnudharmasutra HI 16-21 
and the Visnudharmottara H 24. 48-49, Santi 69. 29, that those 
who are highly devoted to dliarma should be appointed to the 
ecclesiastical or judicial department, the brave ones to military 
woik, those who are skilled to revenue work and those who an 
very trustworthy should be placed in charge of mines, salts, 
toll-gates, ferries, elephant forests. 

Kautilya in his 2nd aclhtkamna exhaustively deals with the 
work done in 28 departments and the duties of their superm- 
tendents He enters into very minute details about m* 
and hfe work is encyclopaedic in character on this subject 

{^n= on VI i. 322

Kautilya's work became the authority on Government and 
several inscriptions mention officers appointed according to 
the section on ' adhyaksapracara ', which is undoubtedly a 
reference to Kautilya's 2nd adhikarana. For example, in the 
Belava- plate of Bhojavarmadeva (E. 1. vol XTJ. at 
p. 40 ) and in the Barrackpur grant of Vijayasena ( E. I 
vol. XV. p 283) we have the words 'anyaihsca sakala- 
rajapadopajlvinodhyaksapracaroktan ihsklrtitan cattabhata- 
jatiyan janapad&n ksetrakaramsca'. It is not possible to do any thing 
more than indicate very briefly the sphere of each adfiyaksa. 
The duty of the sannidhatr ( H 5 ) is to look after the construc- 
tion of the treasury house, the store-houses for merchandise, for 
grain, for forest produce, for amis and of the jail The samahartr 
( the Collector-General ) is to exercise superintendence over the 
collection of revenue from forts, the rural parts, mines, embank- 
ments, forests, herds of cattle and roads for traffic (H. 6 ). The 
samahartr'" has to divide (n 35) the kingdom into four 
districts and to arrange the villages into three grades, viz. those 
that are exempted from taxes, those that supply soldiers and those 
that pay taxes in the form of grain, cattle, money, forest produce, 
free labour and other equivalents for taxes It is the duty of the 
gopa to look after a group of five or ten villages under the orders 
of the samahartr. The gopahas not only to register the total number 
of the inhabitants of all varnas in the houses that pay taxes and 
that are exempt in the villages, but also to keep a register of the 
number of cultivators, cowherds, merchants, artisans, labourers, 
slaves, biped and quadruped animals, of the amount of 
money, free labour, tolls and fines that are recovered, and the 
number of women, men, young and old persons, and the extent 
of their actions, occupations, usages, expenditures. The sthmiika 
(m charge of each of the four districts) should look after his 
chaTge in the same way. The superintendent of records and 
accounts (aksapataladhyaksa) should have the account office 
constructed with its door facing the north or the east, with rooms

(for the clerks) set apart and with shelves of account books well- 
arranged (II 7) This officer had to enter numerous matters in the 
accounts, recover the king's dues from the sureties of servants, 
to check enbezzlement and to recover fines for loss due to 
neglect or fraud. The account year ended with the full moon of 
AsaQha, the year being of 354 days and the salary for an 
intercalary month being separately paid. Among the duties of 
the Superintendent of records and accounts was the important 
one of noting in his register the dharma, method of judicial 
procedure and the usages of countries, villages, castes, families 
and corporations ( desagramajati-kulasanghatanam dharma 
vyavahara-caritra-samsthanam . . nibandha-pustakastham 
karayet ) In H 8 Kautilya specifies forty modes of embezzle- 
ment by Government servants ( to which a reference is made 
in the Dasakumaracarita VIII) In H 9 he employs the 
picturesque figure that it is not possible to know exactly how 
officers appointed to the several businesses of the State extract 
wealth, just as fish always dwelling in water cannot be observed 
when they drink water The superintendent of treasury (H 11 ) 
shall in the presence of qualified persons receives into the 
treasury gems, pearls, articles of gieat or small value and forest 
produce ( like sandal wood, aqmu etc ) The superintendent of 
mines and of government manufactories (II 12) must be 
proficient in the science of metals, mercury, liquids that ooze 
from the holes, caves and sides of mountains and hills Under' 
him are ofilcers called loJiadlnjuhsa ( who carries on the manu- 
facture of vessels of copper and othei metals ), a Msamdhyalsa 
( a superintendent of mint, who manufactures silver and copper 
coins for the State ), a i Apadai iaka m « ( examiner of, coins, who 
regulates the dealings with panas as a medium of exchange 
among the people and for stocking in the treasury), hhanyadhyaksa 
( who attends to conches, diamonds, pearls, coral and trade m 
them), a lavanadhyaksa ( superintendent of salt ) The suvania- 
dhyaksa (the superintendent of gold) has to construct a 
gofdsmithl office for the manufacture of gold and silver artide 
with a single door and four halls, to appoint a skiM and 
^worthy goldsmith to have a shop in the cento oMta»*

outer the goldsmith's shop. If any one so entered he was to ho 
beheaded. The State goldsmith ( II. 14) has to manufacture gold 
and silver coins for the citizens and rural inhabitants through 
artisans employed hy him. The superintendent of the storehouse 
( n. 15 ) has to keep together the produce of crown lands, taxes 
from the country districts, accidental revenue, manufacture of 
rice, oil &c. The superintendent of commerce ( panyadhyaksa, 
H. 16) should keep himself acquainted with the demand or 
Absence of demand for and the rise and fall in the prices of 
various kinds of merchandise produced on land or from water 
and brought hy land or water routes The superintendent of 
forest produce ( kupyadhyaksa, IL 17 ) was to collect forest 
produce through guards of forest and Kautilya gives a long list 
of trees, varieties of bamboos, creepers, fibrous plants and rope- 
making material, drugs and poisons, skins of various animals, 
that came under this officer's care. The superintendent of 
armoury ( ayudhagaradhyaksa, II. 18 ) was to employ experienc- 
ed artisans to manufacture arms, wheels, machines, armour &c. 
required in battle or for the defence of fortb, or for battering the 
cities of the enemy The superintendent of weights and

onwards up to one hundred suvarnas, weights being made of iron 
or stones found in the Magadha country and the Mekala 
mountain. The superintendent of tolls (sulkadhyaksa, H 21) 
was to erect near the principal gate of the capital a toll-house 
and itB flag and when traders arrived with merchandise make 
four or five toll-collectors take down their names, whence they 
came, what merchandise they brought and whether it bore seal- 
mark. In H. 22 Kautilya specifies various rates of tolls for 
imports and exports. The superintendent of weaving (H. 23) 
was to employ qualified persons to make threads, coats ( of 
armour ), cloths and ropes and he was to employ for cutting 
wool, fibres, cotton, hemp and flax, widows, cripple women, girls, 
ascetic womon paying off fines by doing work, mothers of 
prostitutes, old women servants of the palace, deoadasis ( temple 
girls) who have ceased to do templo services This superintendent 
was charged with the task of providing work for women who do 
not leave their homes, the wives of persons who have gone 
abroad, women who are cripple or unmarried and who have to 
work for their own maintenance. He was to give to them spinn- 
ing work through the maid-servants in his department If he 
stared at their faces when they came to exchange their work for 
wages or spoke to them on any other matter he was fined in the first 
amercement. Thus the State helped home or cottage industry 
It is to be noted that he had large powers of levying fines and

in Magadha it was only equal to two gavyutis (last verse of desadhyaya in 
bbumikhanda). Kaut gives hastas of various lengths for various purposes 
Compare Manu VIII 132-134, Visnudliarmasutra IV 1-7, Yaj I 362-363, 
Narad a paris'ista S7-60, Brhatsambita, 57 1 ff, Vayupurana 101 118 for 
some of these, which differ in some details from Kaufilya's statements 
Kaut (II 20 ) states the duration of a tiadtka to be the time required for 
the passage of one adhaka of water from a pot through an aperture of the 
same diameter as a wire of 4 angulas in length and made out of four 
suvarnamasakas. 2 nadikas are equal to a muhurta and IS muhurtas are 
equal to a day or a night In II 19 he gives measures of corn as follows — 
4 kudumbas = prastha, 4 prasthas = adhaka, 4 adhakas = drona. 16 dronas 
= khari. 20 dronas = kumbha. The drona differed for various purposes. 
Vide above (p 124 note 16S) for a quotation from JWit. on Yaj III 274 
Hemadri. vratakhanda pp 51-57. gives quotations from various sources for 
measures of time, corn &c. These measures were different in dtfferen 
countries and at different times The Lflavati (of 12th century ad) 
I 7 speaks of the khari in Magadha being equal to 16 dronas. Vide n iw 
above and H. of Dh. vol. II p. 881 n. 2053 and I. D. Barnetfs 'Annuities 
of India ' (pp. 206-210) for tables of weights and measures.

awarding bodily punishments g. g. if a woman refused to work 
after receiving the wages ho could cut off her thumb ( ? or bind 
up her thumb with the index finger so as to form a pair of tongs ). 
The superintendent of agriculture (sltadhyaksa, ,86 It. 24) himself 
knowing or assisted by those who know the science of agriculture 
and the Ayurveda ( the ai\cient loie ) of trees was to collect at 
the proper times all kinds of com, flowers, fruits, vegetables, 
bulb 1 ;, hemp and cotton seeds and to employ slaves, labourers 
and prisoners who worked to pay off fines they could not pay, to 
sow soeds on crown lands. In this chapter he makes interesting 
remark-j about the extent of rainfall viz. the rainfall in ajaugala 
country (defined above at p. 132) is 16 dronaa, in anupa(very moist) 
countries 24 dronas, 134 dronas in the Asmaka country { modern 
Khandesh and part of Berar ), 23 dronas in the Avanti country 
(round about modern Ujjain), an immense quantity in the 
Aparantas ( west coast of India ) and the Himalayan regions. 

The superintendent of liquor was to carry on the traffic in 
liquor and ferments in the capital, the other parte of the country 
and in aimy camps by employing men familiar with them, he 
was to impose a fine of 600 panas if any one other than the 
manufacturers, licensed vendors and vendees sold or purchased 
liquor, he was not to allow liquor-shops to be opened close to 
each other, he was to see that liquor was sold in small quantities 
such as { or ^ of a Lumumba or a half prastha to persons of known 
charactei in order that ( lit. for fear ) woikmen employed should 
not cause loss through carelessness, that anjas might not

wine, as he did not allow any one to drink wine in the day-time 
( IV. 4. 43 ). The superintendent of slaughter houses ( siinS- 
dhyaksa. JL 2G ) was entrusted with the power to regulate the 
killing of animals for meat and was to impose the highest amerce- 
ment on those who trapped or heat or killed deer, cattle, birds or 
fish which were doclared to he under State protection or that 
dwelt in protected forests The superintendent of nautch-girls 
( ganikadhyaksa ,87 ) is dealt with in H 27. The topic of veiyas 
has already been treated of in H Dh. vol. II pp 637-639. Kaut. 
says that a qumha was to be employed for a salary of one 
thousand panas, whether she was born in a prostitute's family 
or not and she was to possess beauty, youth and accomplish- 
ments ( i e the G4 kalQs enumerated in Kamasutra I. 3. 16 ). 
Kaut prescribes that, if she left the country or died,hei daughter 
or sister took her place and estate or her mother could substitute 
some other ganika m hei place ; when none of these existed the 
king took her wealth and her son did not inherit her wealth. A 
ganika could purchase her freedom by paying to the king 24000 
panas as ransom She was to hold the umbrella, the golden 
pitcher and the fan for the king when he was seated on the throne 
or in a chariot or in his palanquin. There were grades among the 
ganikSs as best, middling and inferior and salaries differed by a 
thousand. The eons of prostitutes were to be the chief actors on 
the royal stage It appears from these provisions that the 
vesyas were more or less slaves The superintendent of ships 
( navadhyaksa, H 28 ) was to look after the passage of ships not 
only over the seas and at the mouths of rivers, but also over 
lakes and rivers in the sthanlya ( vide above p 140 ) and other 
sab-divisions of the kingdom Kaut prescribes that villages on 
the sea-shore and river banks were to pay a fixed tax, fishermen 
were to render a sixth part of the haul of fish as fees for fishing 
licenses and merchants were to pay the customary tolls levied in 
port towns. This superintendent was to request the ships that 
touched at a harbour on their voyage to a distant port topaytoe 
toll, he was to destroy pirate vessels bound for the country ofan 
enemv as well as those that violated the usages of the port in* 
SSInteno^nt of cattle ( JL 29 ) was entrusted with the rearing,

preservation and care of cows, bulls, buffaloes and tbe dairy 
produce. The superintendent of horses ( IL 30 ) wcm to record the 
breed, age, colour, marks, groups and places of origin of hortcs, 
which were to be classified as those kept in salehouses for sale, 
those that were recently purchased, those captured in battles, 
those that were pledged and those temporarily kept in stables &c. 
Kaut notes that the breed of horses from Kambhoja, Sindhu 
(modern Sindh ), Aratta ( western Punjab ) and Vanayu ( North- 
west of India ) countries are the best of horses, Bahllka (modern 
Balkh), Fapeya, Sauvira (eastern Sindh and western Bajputana) 
and Taitila breeds are of middle quality and the rest are 
inferior. The superintendent of elephants ( 31 31 ) had to take 
steps to guard elephant forests and supervise elephants that 
were in stables, the catching, training and feeding of them, thoir 
accoutrements &c Kaut devotes one chapter ( H 32 ) to the 
training and classification of elephants and medical treatment 
when they fell ill The superintendent of chariots and that of 
infantry ( IL 33 ) have the charge of the chariot depaitment and 
of the six classes of infantry respectively. The superintendent 
of passports ( mudradhyaksa ) issued passes to inhabitants of the 
country or foreigners for entering into or going out and the 
superintendent of pastures ( U. 34 ) was to see the passes and 
devote himself to the care of pastures Kautilya provides that 
a pass ( mudra ) was to be given on payment of a masaka, that 
one could enter into or go out of a country only when one had 
a pass, that a person who entered without a pass was to be fined 
twelve panas and that the superintendent of pastures and his men 
were to examine whether persons not going by the royal road but 
through pastures had a pass or not and that the superintendent 
of pastures and his men were to convey the approach of thieves 
and enemies by beating drums and blowing conches and 
were to send messages about the entrance of enemies into 
pastures by means of domesticated pigeons carrying letters bear- 
ing the official stamp or by means of smoke and fire. The 
n&garaka ( the mayor of the capital or cities or the chief of the 
police in the capital ) was to look to the affairs of the capital 
( or the big cities ) A gopa ( under the •nagaraka ) was to superin- 
tend a group of twenty or forty families in the capital and 
an officer designated sthamka was to be in oharge of each of four 
■wards into which the capital was to be divided. Taj II. 173 
mentions an officer called Uhanapala in connection with the 
finding of lost goods who appears to be the "same as sthanika 
The gopa and sthSnika had to keep a register of the caste, gotra,

name and occupation of the men and women in their districts 
and also of their income and expenditure Managers of 
charitable institutions had to send information to them about the 
heretics and travellers arriving to reside therein. Numerous 
rules about reporting and punishments for various defaults and 
wrongs are laid down, which are passed over. Manu VH 121 
and Santi 87. 10 also provide for the appointment in each city 
( in the kingdom ) of a high officer, who was to superintend 
all matters affecting the city and who had ample powers of 
restraint and coercion Many of the superintendents mentioned 
by Kautilya occur under the same names in the K&masfitra e.g, 
gavfidhyaksa, sutrSdhyaksa, nagaraka ( explained by the com 
as dandapSsika ), panyadhyaksa (in V. 5. 7-10) Vide E I 
vol. 15 pp,JlS7-128 for a statement on the provincial adminis- 
tration under the Guptas. 

As regards the emoluments of the officers in charge of a 
village, ten villages &c. Manu ( VH 118-119 ) has some interes- 
ting rules: 'The headman of a village should obtain (as his 
emoluments ) those articles which the villagers have to furnish 
every day to the king viz. food, drink, fuel and the like The 
officer over ten villages should enjoy one feito 188 , that over 
twenty villages should enjoy five kulas, the superintendent of a 
hundred villages should receive the revenue of one village and 
the high officer over a thousand villages should enjoy (the 
revenue of ) a town. All this, as Medhatithi says, is only apptoxi-

responsibilities of eaoli officer should be received by hirn. Vide 
Santi 87. 6-8 for rules similar to Manu's (where the officer 
over a thousand villages gets as his salary the revenues of a 
sakhanagara ). Kautilya ( in V. 3 ) sets out the salaries of many 
officers and servants as follows : the salary paid to the chief 
niantrin.purohita and a few others has been already stated above 
(p. 120 ) ; the dauvarika, the superintendent of the harem ( antar- 
varhsika), the prasSstr, the samahartr and the sannidhate were to 
receive 24000 panas; the princes (other than the crown prince), 
the nurse (mate, mother?) of the princes, nayaka, the superinten- 
dent in charge of justice ( or commercial transactions ? ) in the 
capital (the pauravyavaharika ), the superintendent of royal 
manufactories (karmantika), the members of the council of 
ministers, the rastrapala ( governor of a province ), antapala 
(the guardian of the borders) were to receive 12000 panas; the 
salary of the heads of srenis (the military corporations ?), the 
heads of the elephant army, cavalry, and chariot army, and the 
pradestrs was 8000 panas; the superintendents (below the

tlie appointment and transfer of those under them. But there 
shall be no transfer of those who are the king's personal 
servants and of those who are appointed to guard forts and the 
country parts. The SukranltiBara (1. 211) emphasizes that salaries 
should be in panas, that a king should not make a gift even of a 
finger-breadth of land as emolument to any servant, but that if 
he does give land, it should be held only for the life-time of the 
officer ,B '. Kautilya (in II 1 ) prescribes that lands may he 
granted as emoluments to superintendents (of the various depart- 
ments ), the accountants, to officers called gopa and sthanika, 
to officers in the army, physicians, horse-trainers, but without 
power to sell or mortgage Sukra IL 117-204 mentions numerous 
officers of the army, the treasury &c. Sukra IV. 7. 24-27 sets 
out the salaries of officers, when the king's income is one lakh 
of mudras a year. Kaut provides for pensions and gratuities. 
He says ' the sons and wives of those that die while on duty 
shall get subsistence and wages. Young children, aged persons 
and ailing persons related to the (dying) officers shall be 
shown favour On occasions of funerals, sickness or child- 
birth the king shall bestow money and honours on them' The 
Mahabharata ( Sabha 5. 54 ) piesciibes M0 that it is the duty of 
the king to support the wives of those that meet death or 
calamities in the king's service Sukra II 406-411 contains very 
modern-looking rules about sick-leave, casual leave, pension 
after 40 years of service &c 

The above provisions from Eautilya's work show how States 
in ancient India engaged in almost all the activities of modern 
States, had an equally complicated machinery of administration 
and an army of high and low officers. It will also he noticed 
how, as in India at present, comparatively very high salaries 
were paid to ministers and heads of depaitments as compares 
with the salaries of clerks (e g the ordinary clerks received

food of a gramakuta could not be partaken by a brahmam. 
The GathasaptasatI frequently refers to the great influence of 
the gramanl and the love adventures of his son in the village 
(I 30-31, VH. 24). The Kamasutra states (V. 5.5) that the 
young son of a gramadhipati had certain women of the village

a grama ( village ) is one krosa in extent and yields a revenue

cannot be entered by robbers In the Sabhaparva 5 84 five officers 
of a village are referred to It appears that from being a very 
high officer ( a ratnin ) in Vedic times the gramanl was reduced 
in his influence, came to be appointed by the king alone and the 
office became hereditary and could be given permanently Vide

EI. vol. YJL p. 177, 188, 189 '". The Sukranltisara ( II 120-21 ) 

states that there were to be six officers in a village and (II. 428-29) 

prescribes their caste, viz. sahasadhipati (i.e. a magistrate to deal 

with wrongs involving force ) was to he a ksatriya, gramanetr 

(the headman) a brahmana, bhagahaia (the peison collecting the 

state land revenue) a ksatriya, lekhaka (a scribe, corresponding 

to the modern hilkanj.1 intheDeccan) should he a kayastha, 

sulkagraha (the toll-gate keeper) a vaisya, pratihfira (the 

guard at the gate of the village wall ) a sudra. Sukra ( in H. 

170-175 ) sets out their duties. The headman was to he alert in 

protecting the villagers like their parents from thieves, robbers 

and from the State officers, the bhagahara was to devote special 

caTe to the tending of trees ; the lekhaka was to be skilled in 

accounting and proficient in several spoken languages; the 

pratibara was to be of strong body, proficient in arms, humble 

and to call the villagers with the respect due to each; 

and the toll-gate keeper was to levy tolls in such a way that 

sellers did not incur loss of capital spent by them. From 

Kaut 1H 10 it appears that the village headman had the 

authority to inflict fines in certain cases e g when the headman 

( gramika ) had to travel on some business of the whole village 

the villagers were to accompany him by turns, but if they failed 

to do so they had to pay a fine of one pana or a half pana. 

Similarly, if a villager does not co-operate in the getting up of a 

show (preksa) in the village, he or his people would not he 

allowed to see the show and he was to be fined if he clandestinely 

saw it In villages, particularly in Karnataka and South India

Kotavumachgi Inscription of Calukya VikramadityaV dated 

sake 934 ( 1012 A D ) it appears that Ummachige was a great 

educational centre in the 11th century and 104 Mahajanas of the

important information about local administration in villages. 
A compact formed among villages, guilds and corporations 
{ gana ) is called a samaya ( agreement ) ; such an agreement must 
be observed in times of distress and for acts of dharma. Two, 
three or five persons shall ba appointed as advisers of groups ; 
their advice shall be followed by the villagers, the guilds, the 
corporations and others Examples of agreement as to times 
of distress are : When there is drought, there may be a compact 
that for the performance of a sacrifice to the planets or tho like 
each field or house should contribute so much money or when there 
is trouble from robbers, each house should send one able-bodied 
and armed man. Then examples are given by Brhaspati himself 
about acts of dharma. The village people should put down in 
writing what work they are going to do, such as the repair of 
a house for their assembly, a shed for distributing water to 
travellers, a temple, a tank or a garden, the performance of the 
necessary samBkaras ( upanayana or funeral rites ) of the poor 
and helpless, gifts for the performance of sacrifices, prevention 
of famine-stricken groups of families from coming. Such conven- 
tions would be proper and should be respected by all the villagers. 
Whoever being able to carry out such agreements violates them 
should be punished with loss of all wealth and banishment 
Brhaspati further says 187 that the heads of families, guilds and 
ganas and the inhabitants of towns and forts may pronounce 
the two punishments of reprimand and condemnation against 
wrong-doers and may also excommunicate them and the punish- 
ments and favours declared by them according to rules should 
be approved of by the king, since such power is regarded by the 
sages as delegated to them. Vac ejecting out of the village one 
who is not guilty of theft or adultery with another's wife the 
village headman or the village was liable to pay, accordine to 
Kantilya m 10, a fine of U panas. It will be seen rC 4S 
has Preceded that village administration was self-contained and 
would function whatever Government might happen to be at the 
centre The central Government didnot very much interfere with 
local administration, except in the matter of land revenue 
protection against invasion and exercised only general control' 
and supervisi on. The village communities were miniature States!

158 History of DharmaiUslra [ Vol. 

There was a great deal of decentralization or devolution of 

authoiity from the central government to the village committees 

and authorities. They were also entrusted with civil and 

criminal justice, as we shall see later on. For further details 

on the organization of a village as a political unit, DrRO 

Majmudar's ' Corporate life in Ancient India ' chap JL pp 135 ff. 

and Fick ( p. 161 ) may be consulted. Just as there was some 

organization in villages in general, so also guilds ( srenis } and 

groups ( ganas } had their own regulations and conventions. In 

XI 1 Kautilya refers to ksatriya guilds in the countries of 

Kumbhoja andSuTastra that maintained themselves on husbandry 

and followed the profession of arms (vide above p. 88 n. 120 ). 

In in. 14 he refers to guilds of workmen or labourers ( sangha- 

bhrtah ) Manu ( 1 118 ) declares that his work deals not only 

with the enduring dharmjs of countries, castes and families, 

but also with the dharmas of heretical sects ( pSsanda ) and 

of groups (gana). Manu (Vm 41) requires the righteous 

king to consider carefully the dharmaB of castes, countries, 

guilds and families ( to find out whether they are opposed to the 

Vedas ) and uphold those dharmas ( that are not opposed ) as 

binding ( on those respective persons ) Yaj. II 192 prescribes 

that the king should respect the usages and conventions of 

occupational guilds, merchants, heretical sects, and groups 

( corporations &c ) and allow them to pursue the course of action 

they had followed from ancient times, NSrada (samayasySnapS- 

karma, verses 2-6 ) and Brhaspati quoted in the Viramitrodaya 

(vyavahara) contain very important directions as to ym 

conventions of guilds the king shonld respect and uhat he* not

cause terrible danger. 198 A good deal has already been said 
about guilds and corporations in H. Dh. vol. H pp. 66-69. Among 
inscriptions, the following may be studied : the Nasik Ins. No. 15 
of the time of iLbhlra Isvarasena ( E. I vol. VHI p. 88, where the 
srenis of potters, oil-pressers and water-draweTB receive deposits), 
Junnar Buddhist cave Inscription ( A. S. W. L vol. 4 p. 97, where 
a deposit of money with srenis of bamboo-workere and braziers is 
made),GuptaInscriptionNo. 16 p. 70 (an endowment was entrusted 
to the guild of oil-men, whose head was Jivanta), Gupta Inscript- 
ions, No. 18 p. 79 (silk weavers from Lata coming to Dasapura and 
building a Sun temple ), E. I vol. 15 p. 263, E. 1 vol. 18 p. 326 
and p. 30, E. L 16 p. 332, E I vol. L 155 ( of 933 safiwat, inscrip- 
tion at Gopagiri, modern Gwalior, where the guilds of oil-millers 
and of gardeners aTe mentioned ), L 184 ( Fehoa inscription, 
where a guild of 34 horse-dealers from different countries, some 
being brahmanas, agreed to impose upon themselves and their 
customers tithes to be distributed to certain temples). Ehys 
Davids in 'Buddhist India '(pp. 90-96) gives a list of the 
18 guilds that probably existed in the times of the early Buddhist 
works (though two or three of them are of (Subtful existence) 
and the number of which (18) is sometimes mentioned in the 
JStakas (as in Mugapakkhajataka No. 538, vol. VI p, 14 in 
Cowell's tr.). For further details about the working and 
organization of guilds, vide chap. I of Dr. E. C. Majmudar's 
Corporate life in ancient India', and ' Indian Culture ' vol 6 (for 
1940) pp. 421-28 ( on the economic guilds of blacksmiths, barbers

from Sankha m ' a hamsa ( swan i e a good king) surrounded 
by vultures (greedy servants) is not desirable, but a vulture 
( i e a greedy king ) surrounded by hamsas ( servants of spotless 
character) may be preferred* The Bajarutiprakasa (p 185) 
quotes the same passage from Sankha-Likhita with an addition 
viz. ' faults arise from those who surround the king and such 
faults are enough to rum ( the king ) Therefore the ( king ) 
should first ( before engaging his servants ) put down in writing 
whether servants are endowed with learning, character and good 
family.' Sukra inculcates loyalty on servants in the following 
remarkable* 00 words 'one should not forsake a good master 
when he is in adversity. Should not one always and quickly 
desire the welfare of one's protector whose salt (lit food) one 
has eaten with honour even once ' ( H 246-247 ) ? This senti- 
ment pervaded most Hindu servants in ancient and medieval 
times, even under foreign rulers professing a different religion 
The Bajanltiprakasa p. 176 quotes a fine verse from the Garuda-

Some responsibilities of the Government or king in ancient 
India towards the people will now bo dealt with. From Kautilya 
( IL 29 and H. 34 ) we find that the State made great efforts for 
the rearing of cattle, made stringent rules for their protection 
and for the provision of pastures. Manu VBI 237, Ya) II. 167, 
Matsya 227. 24 also make provision for pastures round villages, 
towns and cities Kautilya requires the superintendent of cattle 
to classify cattle as calves, steers, tameables, draught oxen, bulls 
to be yoked, stud-bulls, bulls meant for carts, cattle meant for 
meat and buffaloes meant for carrying loads or for being yoked, 
pregnant cows, milch cattle &c. and to mark them and note in a 
register of beasts the branded marks, natural marks, colour, the 
distance between the horns. He prescribes corporal punishments 
and fine for those who unauthorizedly kill or steal cattle or incite 
others to do so. He prescribes even the amount of fodder, oil- 
cakes, bran and salt on which different kinds of animals put to 
different kinds of work are to be fed. From the Mahabharata 
also we learn that even princes* 01 " went to supervise and 
enumerate the herds of cattle belonging to the State. Vide 
Vanaparva 239. 4 and 240. 4-6. Even such a grammatical 
work as the Mahabhasya incidentally gives expression to the 
view that a country's wealth consists in its food-crops and in 
abundance of cattle. 

We saw above (pp. 130-131 ) that spie B were to be employed 
(ace toKaut.) to test whether State officers took bribes. Taj. 
(I 336,338, 339) prescribes that the king should protect his 
subjects from the harassment caused by mjastltas (the account- 
ants and scribes), that he should ascertain the doings of the State 
officers through spies, honour those that are well-conducted and 
severely punish those who are badly behaved and should deprive 
those who take bribes of their wealth and banish them from the 
country. Vide also Manu VII 122-124 and Vismidharmottara 
for sumlar rules. The Faficatantra a 343) has the same verse as

Great attention was paid to agriculture In the Sabhaparva 
5. 77 the king *°* is advised to have large tanks in different parts 
of the country full of water and to see that agriculture did not 
depend on the rains alone Megasthenes (ETagment I p 30 
of McCrindle's work ) notes that the greater part of the soil of 
India was in his day under irrigation and consequently bore 
two crops in the year. Even from .the Tai S V 1 7 3 it 
appears that two crops were grown in the yeaT ( tasmad dvih 
samvatsarasya sasyam pacyate). The Vaj S. 18 12 contains a 
libt of twelve different kinds of crops such as rice, y<im, wheat, 
musa, sesame, mudga, maswa &c and the Br TJp VI 3 13 
enumerates ten kinds of grain ( gramySni dhonyani) In the 
Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela king of Kalinga ( E I

been opened in the 103rd year of the Nanda kings ( L e in the 
4th century B. O ) was extended by him in the 5th year of his 
reign. Eudradaman at great expense from his own treasury 
without any additional taxation or demand for free labour 
restored the famous Sudarsana lake near Junagad (E.I vol VIII.

Asoka and been breached by floods Irrigation had been made 
use of from Vedic times Sg VH. 49 2 refers to rivers and 
springs naturally flowing and to channels that were dug up. 
South Indian Inscriptions show how the Pallavas and kings of

themselves or after some distinguished chief of the locality and

work for 36 dlnuras ( vide Rajataraiigint V. 84-117 ). Kautilya 
( 1L 24 ) refers to the various ways in which crops could bo rais- 
ed with water and the revenue to be demanded in each case, e. g. 
those who watered crops with manual labour had to pay l/5th 
of the produce, those who carried water on their shoulders paid 
|th, those who watered their crops by means of water-lifts or 
water-wheels from nataal springs paid one-third and those who 
raised water from rivers, lakes, tanks and wells paid -Jth. He 
notes that sugarcane crops aTe a heavy responsibility, as thoy 
are liable to many evils and entail great expense. Sugarcane 
had been grown even in the times of the AthaTvaveda (I 34. 5 ). 
The Sukranitisara (IV. 4.60) remarks that the king should see to 
it that there is plenty of water in his kingdom by digging wells, 
wells with steps, tanks, lakes &c. Megasthenes (fragment 
XXXIV p. 86 of McCrindle's' Ancient India*) says that some 
superintend the rivers, measure the land as is done in Egypt 
and inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main 
canals into their branches so that every one may have an equal 
share of it. Kaut (IV. 3) devotes a special chapter to the 
king's duty to save the kingdom from national calamities, viz. 
fires, floods, diseases, famines, rats, wild elephants ( or beasts ), 
snakes and evil spirits. He gives practical hints for human 
and religions remedies and rites against these calamities The 
measures against famine suggested by him are: the king may 
provide the people with seeds and food, start works for those 
who are distressed, distribute either his own collection of provis- 
ions or that of the rich or call for help from his allies, tax the 
rich and make them disgorge their wealth, migrate to other 
countries that have abundant harvests. National calamities are 
called ift, which are six: excessive rainfall, drought, rats, 
locusts, parrots and too close presence of foreign kings* 05 The 
work of Kamandaka B tate B that calamities are either 
divine or human and that the first are of five kinds

refers to a famine in the country of Anga under Romapsda 
The Nirukta H 10 refers to a drought in the dun past for twelve 
years m the kingdom of Santanu. A Mauryan inscription from 
Mahasthana (ancient Pundranagara) shows that Gandaka coins 
were distributed and also corn to famine-stricken people (J A. 
SB for 1932 p. 123). The Sohagpur Copperplate Inscription 
(of Mauryan times) contains an order of the mahamatras of 
SravastI that the dravya storehouses were to be spent only in 
case of drought Vide Annals of B O. R Institute, vol. XI 
p. 32ff., E L vol. 22 p. 1 and J. A. S B vol. VH (for 1941 ) part 2 
p. 203. The Eajataranginl records several times the occurrence 
of famines in Kashmir at different periods (e. g viJeH 17-54 
V. 270-278, VH 1219 ff ). The Manimekhalai ( chap 28) speaks 
of a famine for twelve years at Kanol in South India There 
was a terrible famine (called the famine of Durgadevl) for 
twelve years in the Deccan about 1396 A D. ( vide Grant Duff's 
' History of the Marathas ' vol. 1 p. 43 ). Vide E, I. vol 15 p. 12 
for a reference to a severe famine in iake 1313 when paddy 
could not be had even at the rate of ten naliB a panarn. 

It has been shown ( in H. Dh. vol. H. pp. 113, 369, 856-858 ) 
how it was the king's duty to support learned brahmanas, to 
hold assemblies of poets and learned men, to make gifts of land 
to educational institutions and to promote learning in all ways 
Vrddha-Harlta VH. 229-230 sayB that only learned brahmanas 
who are endowed with tapas are proper objects of the king's 
bounty. Some emperors like Harsa went f aT beyond what was 
reasonable. The Chinese pilgrim tells us ( Beal's ' Buddhist 
Records &c ' vol I pp 214, 233 ) that at the end of every 
five years Harsa held an assembly ( pan&id ) at Prayaga and 
gave away all in charity. The Sukranltisara ( L 368-369 ) holds 
.that a king should be on the look-out for educated men, should 
appoint them to offices suited to their education, should honour 
every year those who have attained eminence in learning and the 
arts and take measures for the advancement of learning and arts. 
It has already been shown how this had been followed by ancient 
and medieval Indian kings to the letter. A comparison with the 
British Indian Government in the 18th century and the first 
decades of the 19th will be highly interesting. After the battle of 



1H ] Expense on education under British rule 165 

Plassey in 1757 the British East India Company got three such v 
rich provinces as Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. During over 50 
years the only thing that was done by the ruling power for the 
encouragement of learning among Indians was that in 1780 
Warren Hastings started a Mmha^sa of Muslim religious learn- 
ing at Calcutta with a moult i and 40 stipendiaries and Lord 
Cornwallis founded a Sanskrit college at Benares in 1792. 
When the East India Company's Charter was renewed in 
1813 the only provision that was made for education and 
encouragement of learning (by George HI, 1813 chap 155, 
clause 43 ) was ' that il shall and mtuj be lawful for the Governor- 
General-in-Council to direct that nut of any surplus which may 
remain of the rents, revenues and profits arising from the said 
territorial acquisitions, after defraying the expenses of the 
military, civil and commercial establishments and paying the 
interest of the debt, a sum of not less than one lakh of rupeet, in 
each year shall be set apart and applied to the revival and 
improvement of literature and the encouragement of the learned 
natives of India and for the introduction and promotion of a 
knowledge of the sciences among the inhabitants of the British 
territories in India '. Detailed comment is not called for. More 
than 50 years after British rule began, when at least half of 
what is British India now had come into the hands of the British, 
and when the yearly income must have been many crores of 
rupees, the sum of a lakh of rupees was to be set apart for educa- 
tion of two kinds (Eastern and Western) in the whole of the then 
British India. Further this provision was not compulsory but 
only permissive, and was to be availed of only if some surplus 
was left after everything else bad been provided for. 

As in western Jurisprudence, so in India the king was looked 
upon as parens pahnai, the protector or guardian of all minors 
Gaut™ X 48-49 and ManuVEI.27 prescribe that the king 
shall protect the property of a minor until he attains majority 
or until he returns from his teacher's house Medhatithi on 
Manu Vm 27 says that the minor's relatives like the uncles may 
contend that one of them is the guardian of the minor's property 
but it is the king who is to see that the minor's property is kept

her then it is the king who is to protect her. Kaut ™(ni] 

makes it a duty of the elders of the village to take care of and 

increase the properties of minors and of temples. 

_ It was the special concern of the king to see that proper 
weights and measures were used. Kaut (H 19) as stated above 
(pp 145-146) provides for a special superintendent of weights and 
measures. Vas * OT ( 19 13 ) and Manu VUL 403 provide that all 
weights and measures must be duly marked ( or stamped ), that 
once in six months they must be re-examined and that the weights 
and measures for objects required by the class of householders 
must be guarded against falsifications. Yaj. TL 240 and 
Visnudharmasutra V. 122 prescribe as punishment the highest 
ammercement for those who fabricate false balances, edicts, 
measures and coins and also for those who use them in their 
transactions The Nitivakyamrta ( p. 98 ) requires the king to 
be vigilant as regards merchandise, balances and measures, 
since there is none who excels traders in stealing people's 
money before their very eyes. 80s Vide Alberuni ( tr. by Sachau) 
vol I chap XV about weights and measures current in India 
in the 11th century 

Another important responsibility of the king concerned 
thefts. Asvapati, king of Kekaya, boasted that in his kingdom 
there was no thief, no close-fisted person, no drinker of wine,

flj] King's duty in case of tlieft 167 

( Chan. Up. V. 11. 5 ). &p. Dh. S.** (II. 10. 26. 6-8) lays down that 
the officers should protect a city against theft for one yojam 
round it and in the case of villages for one kroia round them and 
that whatever is stolen within those limits must be returned to 
the owners by the officers. Gautama X, 46-47, Manu VUL 40, 
Yaj. 1L 36, Visnudharmasutra HI 66-67, Santi 75. 10 prescribe 
that the king should recover from the thief stolen property and 
restore it to the owner ( without distinction of caste ), that if he 
cannot restore it he should compensate the sufferer from his own 
treasury, and that, if he retained the property recovered from a 
thief or did not make efforts to catch the thief and compensate 
the owner, the king incurred sin. Kaut. HI. 16 contains a similar 
rule. * M VisvarSpa on Yaj. II. 38 quotes- a prose passage m of Br. 
with a similar import. The Visnudharmottara-* 18 ( II. 61. 52 ) 
remarks that if a person is robbed by his own servants then he 
(the king} may endeavour to recover it from the servants (by 
threatening or beating them ), but need not restore it from his 
own treasury. Yaj II. 270-272, Nar. (parisista 16-21) and 
Kat." ! give further directions, viz. the thief should be made 
to restore the property stolen or its price ; if the thief cannot be 
found the officers and wardens of the country pay the price of 
the stolen articles ; the property stolen in the village should be 
made good by the headman of the village, if the thief's foot-steps

are not traced as going out of the village ; if the theft takes 
place in a pasture land or forest ( and the thief is not found ), 
the owner of it should be made to pay ; if however the theft is 
not committed in a forest but on the road then the officers 
appointed to arrest thieves should be made to pay ; the whole 
village may be made to pay the compensation when the theft is 
within the boundaries of a village but outside the limit of the 
residential quarters, if the footsteps of the thief are not traced as 
going out of the village; if the theft takes -place beyond one 
faosa from a village then the surrounding five or ten villages 
may be made to pay the compensation Yaj IL 271 and Kat 
mention an officer called ' cauroddharta * ('or coroddharta ' ) 
The ' cauroddharanika ' ( thief-catcher) is an officer mentioned in 
numerous inscriptions e g in the Palitana plates of Dharasena 
II of Valabhi in Gupta year 252 ( E. I vol. XI at p 83 ), in the 
inscription of Narayanapala where we have both cauToddhaTanika 
and kottapala, modern Kotwal (I A. vol XV p 304) and in the 
grant of Ballalasena quoted above ( p. 153, n 191) Kautilya IV 
13 also gives similar rules and mentions an officer called 
'corarajjuka' who has to make good the loss of merchandise by 
theft between two villages or lands that are not pasture lands. 

The first quality required in a king according to Yaj I 309 
quoted above (p. 44) is great energy and Kaut also (in VI. 1) ment- 
ions 'great energy' (mahotsaha) among the qualities called 'abhi- 
gamika '. Works on dharmasastra and arthasastra emphasize 
the fact that a king must always be full of activity and must 
not be lethargic or fatalistic In the Mababharata the topic of 
human effort and datva (fate or destiny) comes up for treatment 
in numerous places and is put in the mouth of several characters 
with different emphasis according to circumstances. In Adi 
1 246-247, 89. 7-10, SabhS 46. 16, 47. 36, 58 14, Vanaparva 1«J». 
27-28, Udyoga 8 52, 40 32, 159 4, 186 18, Asramavasika 10.29

Santi. 58 13-15, is declared by Brhaspnti to be tbe root of 
rajadharma. Nectar was obtained and asuras were killed by 
the gods by means of energetic action and Indra secured his 
high position in Heaven and heTe by energetic action. 
Br. makes the characteristic remark ' A man who is a 
heTO of action leads those who are heroes in speech and 
the latter are seen to cater for tbe pleasures of the former and 
wait humbly on him '. The Bhagavadglta in its final summing 
up of the philosophy of' Activism without an eye to the fruit of it 
but from a sense of duty declares ( XVHL 13-16 )' that in the 
-Sankhya philosophy five categories are mentioned as conducive 
to the accomplishment of all actions viz the place, the agent, 
various kinds of instruments, diverse and separate activities and 
lastly dmia; that whatever action a man commences either with 
his body, words or mind these five are its causes, whether the 
action be righteous ( nyayya ) or the opposite of it, and that this 
being the true state of things ( i. e the fruit depending on the 
co-operation of five elements and not on one alone ) that man 
who regards himself alone as bringing about a result is a fool 
and has no correct perception * Kautilya also ( 1. 19 last two 
verses ;) says ' activity ( uttlwnu ) is the root of wealth and the 
opposite of it is the root of evil In the absence of activity the 
loss of present and future acquisitions is sure ; by activity a 
king can obtain his desired object and plenty of wealth '. Yaj 
(1.349 and 351} states that success in undertakings depends 
upon both fate and human effort, yet fate is nothing but the

refers to other views viz fate alone leads to success, human 
effort alone does so, that success results of itself (without any 
cause ), while others say that it is Time that brings about all 
results Manu VIL 205, Matsya 221. 1-12 ( all of which are 
quoted in the Rajanltiprak&sa pp. 313-314) and Visnudhannottara 
11. 66 ( which has the same verses as in Matsya 221 ) inculcate 
the same doctrine as that of Yaj. 1 349 and 351 and emphasize 
that one must always make efforts ( tasm5t sadotthSnavafe hi 
bhavyam-Matsya 221. 12 ) The Matsyapurana 221. 2 empha-

in calculating the aspects of planets; there is nothing impossible 
ot accomplishment for those who are determined and who are 
able to put forth spirited efforts ' Kaut (IX. 4 last two verses), 
Kam V 11, XHL 3-11 emphasize the importance of strenuous 
efforts Sukranltisara (1 46-58) holds a long disquisition on effor* 
and duiux It contains the following fine sentiments ( I 48-49 ) 
'Men of intellect whose career is honourable regard human 
effort as the highest ( and not fate ), while impotent men not 
being able to make efforts have recourse to fate; but all is 
centred in both daiva and effort' Vide Eajanltiprakasa 
pp 312-315 and Nltimayukha pp. 52-53 for further remarks on 
daiva and effort In one place the Mahabharata (Udyoga 
127. 19 ) contains the bravest and loftiest advice 'man should 
always press forward ( make efforts ), should never bend; striv- 
ing is manliness; one may even break at a point which is not,

iaktts.i e of it/sa/in, piahhu (or prabhata) and nvmlra. These 
three occur in the Mahabharata ( Asramav&sika 7. 6 ). The 
S. V. p. 46 quotes a sutTa of Gautama (not found in the printed 
Dh. S.) 'the three saktis, viz. prabhu, mantra and utsaha »Te 
based on that (kosa ) '.'** In VL 2 Kautilya defines manlm-iaktt 
as the power of the knowledge ( of statecraft ), prabhutakti as the 
power of treasury and army and ub&Imiakh as the force of the 
king's bravery.* 17 Kautflya (IX. 1) holds a discussion about 
the relative superiority of these three and gives it as bis opinion 
( as against that of the acaryas) that prabhusakti is superior to 
utsahasakti and that mantrasakti is superior to prabhusakti. 
Kam. XV. 32 defines"" the three thus : ' the employment of the 
proper line of policy out of the six npagm ( sandhi, vigraha &c ) 
is called mantrasakti; a Ml treasury and army constitute 
prabhusakti and activity of the strong is called uts&hasakti • 
the king possessed of all these three becomes the conqueror. ' 
The Nltivakyamrta ( sadgunyasamuddesa ) p. 322 defines them 
in the same way.*" According to the Dasakumaracarita "" VJU. 
the goal (or purpose) of a king is determined by mantra (consul-

upayas are four viz. sama ( conciliation ), dana ( giving gifts 
or presents), bheda (causing dissensions) and danda (punishment 
or depriving of property or causing bodily harm).**' Jxi the 
Hfithigumpha Inscription, the king Eharavela (latter half of 2nd 
century B C. ) states that in the 10th year of his reign he sent, 
following the policy of danda, sandhi and sama, an expedition 
ugaiiibt Bbaratvarsa, conquered that land and obtained jewels 
and precious things ( E 1 vol. XX pp. 79, 88 ) This showj. that 
the theory of the upayas must have been evolved several 
centuries before the Christian era. Some others such as Earn 
XVJI 3, Matsya 222. 2, AgnipurSna 226 5-6, BSrhaspatyasutra 
V 1-3, Visnudharmottara II 146-149 add three more to the 
above tour. Sabha 5 21 mentions the number seven and 
Vanaparva 150. 42 mentions sama, dana, bheda, danda and upeksa 
About the additional three there is some difference of opinion, 
most holding that the three are maya, iipeksu and mdnyala 
(Kam., Agnipurana ), while the Barhaspatyasutra (V 263 ) says 
they are uisyfi, upeksa and vadha and others say they that are 
maya, aksa (dice) and mdra)5la ( Sarasvatlvilasa p 42) 
Maya means ' deceitful trick '. The Visnudharmottara II 148 
gives illustrations, such as tying a firebrand to the tail of a 
bird that often perches on the enemy's camp to produce the 
delusion that a meteor ( an evil omen) fell down from the sky 
Earn XVH 54 cites the example of Bhlma's meeting Kleaka 
dressed as Draupadl. Kam ( XVEL 51-53 ) gives other examples 
of maya. Upeksa consists m not preventing a person from 
doing what is unjust or being addicted to some vice or engaging 
in a fight and is illustrated by king Virata's connivance at the 
death of Kleaka ( Earn XVIL 55-57 ) Indrajala means creat- 
ing an illusion by means of incantations and other tricks e. g. 
creating the illusion before the eyes of the enemy that a 
vastaimy is coming to attack them or showing thatangeis 
are descending to fight against them or making a flwj 
of blood fall in the enemy's camp etc ( Earn ivii 
Vjsnudharmottara H. 149 ) About the four well-known upaW, 
Manu (Vn 108-109) says that for the pr osperny of ones 
kingdom sama and danda (punishment) are preferred, but

the king's antagonists do not yield to him by the employment of 
the first three then he may bring them round by danda ( i e.

to be employed as the last resort, since victory is not certain. 
In fee Santiparva 69. 23 the view of Brhaupati is quoted* 18 that 
fighting should always be avoided (as far as possible) and that for 
securing one's purpose three upayas ( other than fighting ) arc 
to be resorted to Brhat-Farasara X p. 280also says that a wise 
man should not resort to fighting and that danda is to be resorted 
to only when there is no other course left In TJdyoga 132. 29-30 
( cr.'ed. chap. 130 ) Knntt sends a message through Krsna to her 
son -. ' begging is forbidden to you nor is agriculture appropriate 
for you; you are a ksatriya living by the power of his arms and 
a protector against injury (ksatat fasta). Kecover your ancestral 
share by sama, dana, bheda, danda and naya '. In Udyoga 150 
( cr. ed 148 ) Krsna informs Yudhisthira how he first employed 
sama, then bheda, then dana ( viz. giving tip the whole kingdom 
for five villages) and how only danda is the proper recourse in the 
case of the wicked Kauravas Hopkins, as very often, being 
obsessed with his ideas of three strata in the Mahabharata Bays 
that three means appear to be the oldest form and four means 
a later idea. There is hardly any warrant for this opinion as 
for many others in the same strain ( J. A O. S vol. XIII pp. 
182-183 n ). The ■Visnudharmottara H. 146 speaks of the four 
upayas and states that danda as regards a foreign state is open 
( prakasa ) i. e. burning and not-open ( aprakasa Le by poison 
or secret death ) The Mit on Yaj. I 346 and Kam XVJ1I 1 say 
the same thing. The Visnudharmasutra HL 38 prescribes that the 
four upayas are to be employed at the proper time and according 
to the attitudes of the hostile king, friendly king, the madhyamu 
and udashia kings 2 *. The Mit on Yaj. I 346 expressly states 
that the four upayas are to be employed not only in the affairs 
between kings but also in the lives of all ordinary people and 
cites a verse wherein a father or teacher addresses a son or pupil 
making use of all four means 22 * Kam. XVH, Mansollasa H.

treat at length of these four up&yas. A few points only are 
noted here. Sama is of five kinds viz. recoanting the good turns 
done by each to the other ; praising the qualities and actions of 
the persons to be won over; declaring the relationship of each 
other; representing the good that will result in future; declaring 
I am yours and I am at your service ' ( Kam XVII. 4-5 ) Dana 
consists in returning, what is deposited with one by another 
consenting to the taking away by another of one's things, mak- 
ing a gift of something now, giving what the other chooses to asL 
for, bending at fixed times what has to be given. Bheda ( sowing 
dissensions) consists in giving heavy bribes or presents to minis- 
ters or feudatories, the crown prince and high officers of the enemy 
that are dissatisfied for various reasons, creating distrust between 
the king and his ministers, the rich men and the handsome 
men in the kingdom by the threat of the loss of life, honour, 
position, and wealth, by the fear of imprisonment, by the fear that 
the king may carry away the beautiful wife of a subject or by 
suggesting that a handsome young man has his eye on the 
king's harem, and suggesting to a king that a kinsman desires 
to secure the kingdom to himself and thereby inducing the king 
to put out his eyes or cut off his limbs. -This is effected by secret 
spies or persons who are in the pay of both kings ( ubkiyavetana, 
ace to MSnasollfisa p 119 v. 995 ) m . Vide Kaut XI 1, Matsya 
chap. 225 and SukralV 1 25-54 for bheda, Kaut XI. I explains at 
length how an aspiring conqueror is to sow dissensions between 
corporations and the leaders of corporations, between chiefs and 
other people One or two passages may he quoted by way 
of sample "Spies gaining access to these corporations (of 
warriors and others ) and finding out jealousy, hatred and other 
causes of quarrel among them should sow seeds of a well-plan- 
ned dissension among them, and tell one of them ' this man 
decries you '. Spies may give publicity to the consideration of 
priority shown to inferior persons in social intercourse in the 
face of the established custom of recognising the status of 
other persons by birth, bravery, and social position. In all 
these disputes the conqueror should help the inferior party with 
men and money and set them against the superior party. A 
woman who has disappointed her lover and has been for-

given may approach and Bay to a chief ' this chief is troubling 
me when my mind is set on you ; when he ib alive 1 cannot 
stay here ' and thus induce the former to slay the latter. " The 
MatsyapurSna 223. 4 states that united people are more than a 
match even for Indra unless bheda is employed, that dissensions 
are of two kinds, internal aud external, of which the former is 
more serious. External dissension means the quairrel with a 
chief, but internal diswnsion means dissension between a king 
and his queen or heir apparent or ministers. One should try to 
prevent dissension with one's own relative. 1 ? Santi 69. 23 also 
advises the conquest of territory by fomenting dissensions. There- 
fore the expedient of 'lUride cf imperii 1 has a respectable antiquity. 
Danda in the case of a king's country consists in sentencing 
to death or corporal punishment or fine and in the case of the 
enemy infighting, destroying or devastating his country by seis- 
ing his crops and grain, cattle, wealth, forts and in imprison- 
ing and injuring his people, burning his villages and forests. 

There were certain privileges that the king enjoyed. His 
rights to treasure trove have already been referred to (H. Dh. 
vol II, p 146 ) Kaut. (IV. 1 ) gives the following rules. The 
person giving information about the discovery of a mine, jewels 
or treasure trove gets one-sixth, but if the informer be a servant 
of the king he gets 4, ; treasure trove beyond 100000 panas went 
to the king wholly ( the finder being entitled to a ith shaTe only 
up to 100000 panas of the whole ) ; a subject who can prove that 
the treasure trove belonged to his ancestors would get the whole 
of it; if he takes it without establishing his ancestral ownership 
he is to be fined 500 panas and 1000 panas if he appropriated it 
secretly. The king also took by escheat the property of a person 
dying without leaving any heir except in the case of brSbmanas 
( vide H. Dh. n, p. 146 where some authorities are cited) This 
subject will be dealt with at greater length under the next sect- 
ion on law and justice* The king was also entitled to all 
property that wasJost or given up by the true owner Vide

that the king should preserve for one year articles found after 
proclaiming the finding by beat of drum, while Manu says that

the period is three yeaTs. The Mit on Yaj. IL 33 reconciles these 
texts by Baying that if the true owner comes to the king and 
establishes his ownership he gets hack the entire article without 
paying anything for safe custody, if the owner comes in the 2nd 
year he pays ■& of the price for custody, if in the thud year he

dispose of the article if none claims it within that period, hut 
if the owner comes after three years and the article has been 
disposed off, the king should return the equivalent of the portior. 
taken by him. Yaj U. 174 specifies other scales of charges for 
the custody of unclaimed animals such as four panas for a horse 
&c. Another special privilege of the king was that he could not

to book the king guilty of injustice But the Dhannasastia 
writers insisted that dhurma was the king of kings ( Br Up I

kings (ManuIX 245), therefore they appealed to the higher nature 
and conscience of the king and prescribed that if a king levied 
an unjust fine, he should offer thirty times of that amount to 
Varuna, tluow the amount m watei or distribute it among

who are well-placed; is rendered charming by temples, piapti* 
( sheds where water is distributed to travellers giali* ) and tanks, 
in which men and women are joyful: which is set off to advan- 
tage by merry gatherings and festivals; the whole extent of 
which is well cultivated; which is full of cattle and free from 
injury (to beings); which does not depend upon rains alone 
( for its crops ) ; which is beautiful, free from beasts of prey and 
all kinds of dangers; which is endowed with mines; which is free 
from wicked men and enjoys prosperity and happiness' The 
Adiparva chap 109 (cr. ed chap 102) also contains a fine 
description of a -well-governed and prosperous country. The 
country was to be full of public wells, gardens and meeting- 
halls (sabha) The Visnu-dharmottara I 13. 3-12 contains an 
ideal description of ancient Ayodhya. ' It was endowed with 
hundreds of parks ; it celebrated festivals and held gatherings 
of people , its population was free from disease and had valiant 
men , it always resounded with the music of lutes, flutes and 
tabors, it had fair complexioned, charming hetmai clever in 
brilliant conversation; its population was always gay, it re- 
sounded with the recitation of the Veda and was endowed with 
companies of brahmanas', its market rows were full of men 
that had applied scents to their bodies; there was not a man 
there 'who was wretched, dirty or emaciated; it stretched for 
three yojanas on the bank of the Sarayu and was ten yojanas

CHAPTER VI 

DURGA (FORT OR CAPITAL) 

Maim IX. 294 places the capital (para) even before rfistra 
Medhatithi (on IX. 295) and Kulluka explain that the loss of 
the capital is a more serious danger than even the loss of some 
territory, because if the capital, which possesses all the stocks 
of food, in which are centred the principal elements and the 
array, is saved, then it is possible to retrieve even lost territory and 
to protect the country. It is as it were the pivot of the whole 
machinery of government. Other writers ( and even Mami in 
VII 69-70 ) place the capital or fort after the raatra It is 
probably due to the geographical situation in North India and 
the nature of the fighting in ancient times that made the capi- 
tal and forts of great importance in the several elements of the 
State, The capital mirrored the prosperity of the country and if 
properly walled also provided security Yaj I. 321 says that 
forts are meant for the safety of the king, the people and the 
treasury (janakoiatmaguptaye) The reason for the construction 
of forts is well put by Manu VH. 74 viz that a single archer 
under the shelter of the fort-wall can fight a hundred of the 
enemy and a hundred can fight ten thousand The Pancatantra 
(L 229 and II. 14 ) has a similar verse. Brhaspati quoted 
by the Bajanitiprakasa 218 p 302 states that the king should con- 
struct a fort with walls and a gate for the protection of himself, 
his wives, the people and the ( wealth ) collected by him Kaut 
(H 3 and 4) deals at length with the construction of durgas 
and the laying out of the' capital in one of them. He says that 
in the four quarters of the boundaries of the kingdom forte 
should be built for offering resistance (to the enemy) on ground 
naturally fitted for the purpose He speaks of J« to** 
forts viz 'audaka' { water-protected, wbich u» on an Mam.

protection of populous places and the last two for the protection 
of foresters. Vfiyu 8. 108 .refers to four kinds of durgas. 
Manu VH. 70, Santi 5$. 35 and 86. 4-5, Visnudharraasatra 
IE 6, Matsya 217. 6-7, /Lgnipurana 222. 4-5, Visnudhar- 
mottara H 26. 6-9, EL 323. 16-21, Sukra IV. 6 speak of 
six kinds of forts viz dhanvadurga ( which is waterless five 
yojanas round a raised plain ), mahldurga { a land fort, which 
is surrounded by a wall built of stones or burnt bricks, that is 
at least twelve feet high and twice as high as it is broad), 
laladurga ( water fort, surrounded on all sides by deep water), 
varksa durga (fort that is surrounded for one yojana on all 
sides with thorny and tall tTees and thorny creepers and 
bushes), nrdurga (fort that is guarded hy a numerous army of 
four sections on all sides), giridurga (mountain fortress, 
difficult to climb and with only one narrow access). Manu 
VH. 71 says that the mountain fortress is the best of all, while 
Sknti 56. 35 states that nrdurga is the most difficult to conquer- 
The Manasollasa (II. 5 p. 78) speaks of nine kinds of durgas 
(adding those built with stones, bricks and mud). The 
ParasurSma-pratapa enumerates eight kinds of durgas (Raja- 
vallabhakanda, folio 1) and states that the wall of a fort may 
be of stones or of baked bricks or of mud Manu VH 75- 
Sabta 5. 36 ( =Ayodhya 100, 53), Matsya 217. 8, Kam. IV. 60, 
Manasollasa HI. 5 (verses 550-555), Sukra IV. 6 12-13, Visnu- 
dharmottara H 26. 20-88 prescribe that forts should possess 
plenty of arms, grain, drugs and other materials, wealth, horses, 
elephants, beasts of burden, brahmanas, artisans, machines 
(called Sataghnls ace to Matsya, that kill a hundred), water 
and fodder. The Nltivakyamrta ( durga-sarauddesa p. 199 ) sayfi 
that there must be means of leaving it secretly, otherwise ifc 
will be a prison and that no one should be allowed to enter it 
or leave it without a pass or without being searched. Kant

wore required The excavations at Mohenjo-daro show that 
walls were built of burnt bricks ( Maishall, vol I. pp 15-26 ) 
There is no reason to assume that houses, palaces and city walls 
could not have been built of bricks, simply because no purely 
Hindu ruins anterior to Alexander have yet been discovered or 
because Megasthenes describes that Patahputra had a wall of 
wooden palisades One must demur to the remarks of Hopkins 
on pp. 174-175 ot J.AOS vol XIII. Walls ( prakara ), toranas, 
(arched gates) and upper stories (attalakas), moats are very 
often spoken of in connection with capitals in both epics The

The king was to have his capital inside a fort or in- 
dependent of it Manu VII. 70, 76, Asramavasi 5. 16 K, 
sSi86.6-10, K5m .lV.57, Matsya 317 9* , to 1^1 
describe where and how a capital was to be built Kaut»l>a

S out viz the extent should be demarcated by three roya 
loads from west to east and three from south to north, the

and water exits: the chariot roads, the royal roads and roads 
leading to drona-mukha, sthaniya, the rastra and pasta 
should be four dandas ( 16 cubits ) in width. He then prescribes, 
the width of roads tor vari.ms other purposes. Occupying 
one-ninth of the whole area of the capital, but to the north 
from the centre of the capital and in the midst of people 
nf all castes the king's own palace should be built facing the 
east or north To the north-east of the palace bhould be the 
residences of the king's teacher iacarya), purohita, ministers 
and the sacrificial place and water reservoir. He then assigns 
appropriate places round about the palace for the offices of 
the beveral superintendents, to merchants, principal aTtisans, 
brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, prostitutes, wool workers, 
sudras&c In the centre of the capital were to be constructed 
apartments for the images of Aparajita, Apratihata, Jayanta 
and Vaijayanta and the temples of Siva, Kubera, the Asvin*. 
Laksnu and Madira ( Durga ? ) The principal gates named after 
Brahma, Yama, Indra and Kartikeya were to be constructed 
At a distance of 100 bows (400 cubits) beyond the ditch.platforms 
for holy trees, groves and embankments should be built The 
cemetery should be to the east or north but to the south for 
the higher varnas Heretics and candalas should have a place 
of residence beyond the cemetery. For each group of ten 
families there muBt be a well ; oil, grain, sugar, salt, medicines, 
dried vegetables, fire-wood, arms, and" other essential 
commodities should be stored in such large quantities that they 
might last for several years in case of a siege or invasion. The 
Matsyapurana ( 217. 9-87 ) differs -from the above description in 
many ways. It prescribes four wide roads, at the ends of which 
a temple, the royal palace, the court of justice arid the principal 
gate are to be respectively constructed Almost the whole of 
the description in the Matsya is quoted by the Rajanltiprakafo 
(pp. 308-313) and also in the Rajadharmakauda pp. 28-36.

mth ( a lane ) and mSrga as respectively equal to 3, 5 and 10 
cubits in breadth, that in the capital there should be no narrow 
street like a padya or vlthi, that even in villages the public road

also a nagarasresthin is mentioned along with others who wore 
approached for consenting to a purchase of land ( E I. vol XV 
at pp. 130, 133, dated Gupta samvat 120 ). Megasthenes ( in 
McCrindle's * Ancient India \ Fragment XXXIV p 187) described 
the city of Palihothra ( Pataliputra ) and its administration. He 
says that six committees of five each looked to the affairs of the 
oity and were respectively in charge of ( 1 ) industrial arts, ( 2 ) 
entertainment and care of foreigners, ( 3 ) inquiries about births 
and deaths, ( 4 ) trade and commerce, weights and measures, 
( 5 ) manufactured articles, ( 6 ) collection of the 10th of the 
prices of articles sold. Fragments XXV-XXVI ( pp 65-67 ) 
inform us that Palihothra was 80 stadia in length and 15 in 
width, that in shape it was a parallelogiam, that it was surround- 
ed by a wooden wall with holes for discharging arrows and a 
ditch in front. Airian states (pp 209-210 of McCrindle's 
* Ancient India ' ) that Palihothra had 570 towers and 64 gates. 
Patafijali m his Mahahhasya frequently brings in Pataliputra 
(e. g in -vol. I p. 380 he states that Pataliputra is alongside of 
the river Sona, on Pan. JL 1. 16 ), in vol. IL p 311 ( vartika 4 on 
Pan. IV 3. 66 ) he refers to its walls and to its palaces, in vol. 
II p. 321 ( on Pan. IV. 3. 134 ). In Fa-Hien's time (399-414 A. D ) 
the royal palace and halls in the midst of the city built of stone 
still existed and were so grand that they were then believed to 
have been the work of spirits ( vide Legge p 77 ). Vide Rhys

In the Btegavatapurana (IV. 18. 30-32 ) it is narrated that 
Prthu, son of Vena, first levelled the earth, established human 
habitations in villages, towns, capitals, forts &c„ and that before 
Prthu people resided where they liked and there were no such 
groups as villages or towns. Bhrgu quoted by Sridhara accord- 
ing to Rajanlti-kaustubha defines grama as the habitation of 
brahmanas, their hired labourers and sudras, that kharvata is 
on the bank of a river and of a mixed character, one side being 
a village and the other a town. Saunaka quoted by the 
Rajamti-kaustubha(pp 103-4) defines kheta as a place where 
brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas reside, that a place where all 
castes reside is called a town, that brahmana householders 
should be established on soil that is whitish ana has sweet odour 
featriyas should be established in towns where the soil is reddish 
ana wafts a sweet odour aud vaisyas on yellowish soil 



CHAPTER VII 
"KOSA (TREASURY OR FINANCE) 

Kaul (U 1) states that a king whose treasuiy is depleted 
preys upon the citizens and the rural population and 
(IL8)very»' rightly remarks that all undertakings depend 
upon kosa (financial position of the king), therefore the 
king must pay the first attention to kosa Gautama (as 
cited by S V p 4G ) holds that kosa is the basis or support of 
the other six elements of the State The Santiparva 119. 16 
calls upon the king to guard his finances with great effort, 
since kings depend upon kosa, which tends to the prosperity 
( of the kingdom ) Earn XHL 33 states that it is on the lipa 
of all that the king is dependent on kosa Santi 133 contains 
a eulogy of kosa. The Visnudharmottara IL 61. 17 says that 
kosa is the root of the tree of State The two great pillars of 
the Indian States in ancient India were the revenue and the 
army ' Manu YEL 65 says that kosa and the government of the 
realm depend on the king i e they should be the personal 
concern of the king Yaj. (I 327-338) recommends that the 
king should personally look into the income and expenditure 
every day and keep in his treasury buildings whatever is 
brought by those who are appointed to bring gold and wealth 
Kam V. 77 and Sukra I 276-278 say the same The Rajataran- 
ginl (VH 507-508) tells us that king Kalasa of Kashmir 
( 1063-1089 A. D. ) kept accounts like a merchant, closely 
watcbed income and expenditure and had a clerk by his side 
with chalk and bleurja ( birch leaf ) to write upon. The principal 
means of filling the treasury is taxation It is therefore neces- 
sary to consider first the principles of taxation as evolved by 
our writers. The first principle was that the king could not 
levy, according to the smrtis, taxes at his pleasure or sweet 
will, that the rates of taxes which the king was entitled to levy 
were fixed by the smrtis and varied only according to the

commodity and also according as the times were normal or 
there was danger of invasion or some other calamity iraponding. 
For example, Gaut. X. 24, Mami VII 130, Visnu Dh. S. HL 22-23 
declare that the king may ordinarily take a sixth part of the 
grain-crops or produce of the soil, hut Kant (V. 2), Mami 
(X,118),Santi87,SukralV. 2. 9-10 permit the king to take 
even one-third or one-fourth part of the crops in times of dis- 
tress ( apad) It has however to he noted that Kautilya requires 
the king to heg ( yaceta ) of the people for this heavy taxation, 
he employs the word pranaya (request) for such demands, such 
taxation was not to he levied from inferior lands, and he 
expressly says that such a demand for excessive taxation is to 
he made-only once and not twice in the same distress. az Santi 
( 87. 26-33 ) contains a specimen of a long address to be given 
to the people when a king demands higher taxation in danger 
( such as ' if the enemy invades you, you will lose all including 
even your wives, the enemy will not restore to you what he 
robs you of * &c. ) The word ' pranaya ' occurs in this sense 
in the Junagadh Inscription of Rudradaman (EL vol VTTT, 
p. 36 11 15-16). Another principle laid down in somewhat 
poetical and picturesque language is that taxation should he 
felt by those taxed as light and not heavy or excessive. The 
Udyogaparva** ( 34. 17-18 ) states ' just as a bee draws honey 
but at the same time leaves the flowers -uninjured, so the king 
should take wealth from men without harming them. One 
(a bee) may search each flower (for honey) hut should not 
cut the very root just like a garland-maker, but not like a coal- 
maker \ Mami ( VII 129 and 140 ) laconically puts the mattex 
thus just as the leech, the calf and the bee take their 
sustenance little by little, so must the king draw from 
his kingdom annual taxes little by little Let the 
king not cut up his own root (by levying no taxes) 
nor the root of others by» » excessive greed'. Santi (88 

*ZE*V*™ wroW ^H <*gS m «i*r , ... tfr mfSwZ 7 *£ 



186 Hutfoiy of J)harmus5*tra [Vol, 

4-6 ) states that the king should draw ( taxes ) from the realm 
lightly m the way the bee draws honey from the trees, he should 
do so in the way of the calf and should not bruise the 
udders (as the calf does not) Those verses also refer 
to the action of the leech, of the tigress carrying her cubs 
between her jaws and the rat gnawing at the feet of sleeping men 
Those ideas pervaded society so much that the same figure of 
the beo is instanced as regards the Buddhist bhikkhu's importu- 
nity for alms in the Dhammapada ( verse 49 ) The king should 
act like a gardener who prepares garlands without harming the 
trees and their leaves and should not act like one who prepares 
coals from trees (Santi 71 20 J 23 *. Manu VH 139 requires that 
the king should not through greed tax the subjects heavily, as 
he would thereby cut off the roots ( i e. prosperity and content- 
ment) of the people, nor should he cut off hi<? own roots (i e 
reduce himself .to bankruptcy) by levying no taxes A third 
principle of taxation was that when increasing taxes the rise 
should be gradual and a little at a time ( Santi 88 7-8 ) Taxes 
were to be recovered at a proper time and proper place (Santi 
88 12 and Kam. V 83-84 ) 286 "When taxing traders the king 
should make allowance for the price they had to pay, for the 
chances of selling the commodity ( in his kingdom ), the dis- 
tance over which the merchandise was brought, what they must 
have spent for their food and condiments and the cost of guard-

ing the merchandise (Maim VII. 127=Santi 87. 13-14)** In 
the case of artisans, before taxing them, the king has to pay 
regard to the labour and skill involved and to the necessaries 
of life required by tuem ( SSnti 87. 15 ), Every one, however 
poor, must contribute something to the finances of the Tealm. 
Manu (VH 137-138) says that even a very poor man who 
maintains himself by following some occupation should be asked 
to contribute every year something in the nature of kara (a tax), 
while workers ( like cooks ), artisans ( like blacksmiths ), sudras 
who subsist by manual labour ( like porters ) should be asked 
to contribute one day's work to the king in a month Vide 
Gaut X. 31-34, Visnu Dh. S. m 32 for the same. But Sukra 
IV. 2. 121 says that workers and artisans should do one day's 
work for the king gratis in a fortnight. Gaut. X. 34 adds that 
the king must supply them with food on the day they work 
gratis The importance of a gold and silver reserve was well 
understood. Kam (IV. 62-64) says S3B that the king's kosa should 
have many sources for filling it, but few outlets of expenditure, 
it should be full of all desired kinds of wealth, guarded by 
trusty officers, rich in pearls, gold and jewels, it should have 
been acquired according to saitric rules, be capable of bearing 
great strain of expenditure and that fcosa i B to be preserved 
only for the purpose of securing the two goals viz. d/ranra and 
aitha, for affording maintenance to the servants engaged by the 
king and as a safeguard against calamities. SukralV. 2 3 remarks 
that koia is accumulated for the upkeep of the army and for the 
benefit of the people and for performing sacrifices. Gaut X. 
28-29, Manu VH 128, VIE. 306-308, NSr. ( praklrnaka 48 ) and 
others say, as has been already stated, that taxation is meant 
for the protection of the subjects and that it is the king's wages

one-twelfth each on charity (to the learned, the poor and 
helpless &c ), ministers, inferior officials, and his private purge 
or expenses Sukra IV. 2 26 requiies the king to have as muoh 
stock of grain as would be required for three years' consumption 
in his country In IV 2 13 he sets before the king the impossi- 
ble ideal that his treasury should be so full that he can support 
his army for 20 years if no taxes from agriculture or tolls were 
raised or no fines were recovered The ManasollSsa (IL 4 394. 
397 p 64 ) says that the king's treasury should be always full 
of' gold, silver, jewels, ornaments and costly clothes, that pure 
gold in the form of niskas ( coins ) or bars or ornaments should 
be held in the treasury Kaut (IV 3) as stated above permitted 
the king in famines to make the rich disgorge their wealth. 
In V 2 he remarks that if after making special requests for 
additional taxation, when the treasury is empty and soma 
danger is impending, to the cultivators, merchants, wine-sellers, 
prostitutes and those who rear pigs, poultry, cattle &c , the king 
may request the rich to give as much of their, gold as they can 
and the king may honour them by bestowing on them a post at 
his court, or the dignity of an umbrella, a turban or sonie 
decoration in return for their wealth" 9 He permits the king in 
calamities to take away the wealth of the corporations («W

these devices w that Kautiiya is careful to point out that they 
were to be employed only against the seditious and the irreligi- 
ous and not against others (V. 2 'etwnduw&adhuimikesu

verse which recommends resort to alchemy tor replenishing the

difficulties to promise interest to the rich and take their wealth 
and to return it with interest when the difficulties are got 
over* 41 . Santi (88. 29-30) asks*" the king to honour the wealthy 
men in his kingdom, since they constitute an important element 
of the realm and are the most eminent among all beings and to 
request them ' confeT along vfith me favours on the people '. 

Several rea«ons are assigned for people's payment of taxes 
to the king Gaut X. 28 says that they should do so because 
he protects them. In some places the idea put forward is that 
taxes are the wages ( vetana ) of the king and that the subjects 
made a contract with the king Manu to that effect Vide

he is entitled to get the sixth part of the produce of land and that 
since human beings reside on land they are declared to be 
owners (in ordinary parlance, but they have only a qualified 
ownership) Several kinds of taxes are mentioned in the

Asoka ( Corpus 1 L vol. I p 164 ) it is said that the village of 
Lummini was made free from the payment of 'bali', but had 
to pay one-eighth share us Here ' bali ' is contrasted with

mean a tax in general Vide &p Dh S H 10 26 10, Manu

were agriculturists, traders, manual workers and artisans. In 
Manu VnL 307 quoted in the Dandaviveka of Vardhamana (p. 5) 
it is said that the king who, without affording protection, levies 
bah, kara, sidka, pratibhoqa ( pratibhaga in the printed srarti ) 
and danda (fines) goes at once to hell and Vardhamana explains 
kara as the dues recovered every month from villagers and 
city-dwellers ( every month or twice a year in Bhadrapada or 
Pauaa according to KullQka ), sulka as the twelfth share re- 
covered from traders, pratibhoga as the dues in the form of 
fruits, flowers and vegetables presented every day A few remarks 
on these and other taxes must be made here Manu VH. 130, 
Gaut. X. 24, Visnu Dh. S. HI 22, ManasollSsa ( IL 3. 163 p. 44 ) 
and several others prescribe that the king is entitled to the 6th, 
8th or lath part ( only sixth in Visnu, also 10th in Gaut. ) of the 
yield of grain from land Brhaspati and the Visnu dharmot- 
tara M6 ( n. 61. 60-61 ) quoted in the Rajanitiprakasa ( pp. 262- 
263 ) make it clear under what circumstances these different 
shares are to be taken : viz the king takes 1/6 of iutedhanya 
(awned or bearded grain like wheat and barley), 1/8 from 
simbidhanya (grain in pods), 10th part from crop3 grown on land 
that was fallow for many years, l/8th from lands sownin the 
rainy season and one-sixth from lands that have spring crops 
The tax was to be paid onoe every year or once in six months 
according to the custom of the country. The varying rates 
prescribed by Kautilya have been indicated in describing 
the duties of the sltadhyaksa Sukra (IV. 2 121-122) gives 
a salutary rule that if a cultivator constructs a tank a 
well or an artificial water-course or brings under cultivation 
land previously fallow, the king should not levy a tax thereon 
till the person making the expenditure has recovered twice the 
amount spent by him. Kant (HI) provides that the king 
may show favour (amig,al<a) to -the cultivators by supplying 
them with seed, cattle and money and that they should return 
the advances by easy instalments and that the king shall 
bestow favours and remissions (parzlma) in such a way that

depletion.*' 7 It has already been stated that according to the 
smrtis the ordinary share of the king was one-sixth, but that in 
case of the danger of invasion or similar calamity he was allow- 
ed to raise it to one-fourth. Megasthenes ( Fragment I, p 43 ) 
says that no person is permitted to own land and that besides 
the land tribute people pay into the royal treasury a fourth 
part of the produce This show6 that the tax on land was very 
heavy in the times of Candragupta probably owing to his wars 
to drive away the Greeks and the huge armies that he had tn 
employ Manu VII 130, Gaut X 25, Visnu Dh. S IE 34, 
Manasollasa ( JI 3 163 p 44 ) hold that the king is entitled to 
the 50th pait ot the cattle reaied by herdsmen and of the interest 
earned by those who lend money at interest This last appears 
to be analogous to modern income-tax The SukranltisSra 
IV 2 128 makes the tax to be & on the interest earned by 
money-lending." 8 Visnu adds cloth to these two Manu VH 
131-132, Gaut X 27, Visnu Dh S HI 25, Visnudharmottara n 
61 61-63 and Manasollasa lay down that the king is entitled to 
a sixth part of trees, meat, honey, clarified butter, perfumes 
( like sandal-wood ), medicinal plants ( like ijudUcl), rasa (salt 
&c ), flowers, roots (like tuimeric ), fruits, leaves ( like palm 
leaves ), vegetables, grass, hides, articles manufactured from 
bamboo slips, earthenware, articles prepared from stones Visnu 
adds deer hides to these 

Sulka is of two kinds, what is levied on goods carried by land 
and what is levied on goods carried by water ( Mit on Yaj L 
263 ) Gaut X 26 and Visnu Dh S. 1H 29 state that the sulka 
is l#0th part on merchandise for sale ( bought and sold in the 
country itself ) which is interpreted by some (like Haradatto 
and Nandapandita ) as meaning that 5 per cent of the price rf 
articles sold should be taken by the king as tax, while the 
Eajanitiprakasa (p 264 ) explains that the king is entitled only 
to five per cent of the difference between the cost price ana tne 
sale price of merchandise Manu TSL m also fa susceptible 
of these two interpretations, as the commentaries of MadnrtWJ

country *«■ 31. 261 says that the sulka on goods is twentieth 
part of the prices of the goods Kant ( H 21 ) in his chapter on 
the superintendent of tolls ( sulkfidhyaksa ) sets out several 
rules, of which a few interesting ones are given here Com- 
modities intended for marriage or taken by a bride from her 
parents to her husband or meant as presents or for the purpose 
of sacrifices or the accancttement of women or for the worship of 
gods, or for the ceremonies of cnida, npanuyana, godUna, or for 
the observance of a viata or for the consecration of a person for 
a sacrifice and for other special ceremonies shall be allowed to 
go free of tolls. Whatever commodities would cause harm to 
the realm or are useless should be destroyed ; whatever is of 
great benefit and seeds not easily available should be allowed 
to be imported without charge 2 ' 9 He further says (11.22) 
that sulka is levied on exports and imports of merchandise and 
N that on imports the tax will be one-fifth of the price of the 
commodities ( as a general rule ) and prescribes varying rates 
(1 '6, 1/10, 1/15, 1/20, 1/25) on different kinds of articles In 
II '28 (on the superintendent of shipping) Kautilya gives 
tether rules some of which have been already noted. He 
prescribes rules for ferries also, viz, that brahmanas, ascetics, 
children, very old people, sick men, messengers, pregnant women 
are to be provided with free passes by the superintendent 
enabling them to use the ferries. A man with a load and small 
animals were to pay one masa at a ferry, a cow or a horse two 
niasas and so on. The Manasollasa ( H. 4 w. 374-376 p 62 ) 
prescribes that the king should well guard all haabours (ida-pui a) 
that are near the sea, that when the boats of sailors residing in 
his own country return to the harbour the king should charge 
one-tenth ( of the price of goods brought ) as the duty and that 
when foreign boats are driven to his harbour by an unfavourable 
wind, the king should confiscate all their merchandise or may 
give a little to the owners of those boats. In this connection a 
very interesting inscription may be refened to The Motupalli

voyages from one country to another were driven or were 
shattered or touched at a place that was not meant as a place of

have with kindness decided to give everything except the fixed

ness ; the sulka fixed is as follows '. About iulka to be levied on 
goods brought by the sea the Baud. Dh. S. (1 10. 15-16) prescribes 
that it is 10 per cent of the cargo except one best artiole (which 
is totally exempted ). In the Kharepatan grant of the Silara 
king Rattaraja dated sake 930 it is provided that one golden 
gadiyam was levied as duty on each vessel that came from 
another country ( dvlpantarayata-vahitrat ) and one golden 
dliarana had to be paid on each vessel coming from the district 
of Kandalamullya excepting Oemulya (modern Gheul) and 
Candrapura. Vide E I vol. m. p. 293 at p. 301 Sukra ( IV. 2

commodity sulka is to be taken in the same country by the king 
only once and never more than once; the king may take either 
1/16 1/20 or 1/32 from the vendee or vendor; no sulka is to 
be taken from the vendor when he has to sell his goods at the 
same price at which he bought them or for less than the cost 
price ; the king should always take from the buyer the proper 
sulka after seeing what profit he is going to make w

more. Though these really required more protection than most 
people, humanity and higher feelings made them exempt from 
taxes from very ancient times The claims to exemption were 
prohably exaggerated and not respected in practice. For example, 
Narada ( VL 14 ) states that the king is not to levy tolls or 
customs duties on articles required by srotriyas for domestic 
use hut if they engaged in trade they had to pay taxes on 
merchandise.* 5 ' The Mit. on Yaj. H 4 states that the six exemp- 
tions mentioned in Qaut. ( VUL 12-13 ) apply only to a very 
learned brahmana and not to all brahmanas. Manu. VH 133 
provides that a king even when he has lost everything should 
not levy a tax on srotriyas and relying on this the Vaijayantt 
explains Visnu Dh S m 26 as referring only to learned 
brahmanas. The Ramayana (HI. 6. 14) MI « states, differing 
from other authorities, that the king Bhares one-fourth of the 
merit of vnims ( ascetics ) dwelling in his kingdom There was 
a corresponding liability on the king ; viz. he shared half and 
half in the demerit due to the sins committed by the subjects 
that are not properly restrained by him ( Yaj. I 337 ) Manu 
and Visnu. Dh S. III. 28 and Visnudharmottara H. 61 25 sav 
that he reaps the sixth part of the sin of his subjects. 

Kaut inH. 15 mentions numerous kinds of taxes or dues 
that were levied by the king It is not possible to explain many 
of the terms used by him. In the ancient inscriptions, when 
making grants of a village and the like, it is usual for the kings to 
specify the exemptions from taxes and dues that went with the 
grant. Such exemptions were called pmthara, which word 
occurs m Kautilya and also in the Hathigumpha Inscription 
of Kharavela (mthe2nd century B C, E I. vol. xx at p 9) 
where we read bamhananam jahm panhw am dadSh'. In certain 
early records even, these exemptions are said to be eighteen

W&nasollasa ( II. 3 verses 332 and 361 ) asks the king to guard 
mines of gems, gold and silver and declares that the Creator 
made the king the ruler over all wealth and especially over 
what is inside the earth. Rudradaman ( 150 A. D ) hoasts that 
he filled his treasury by means of bah, snlha and bhaga levied 
according to the sastras and that his treasury overflowed with 
heaps of gold, silver, diamonds, lupis lazuh and other gems 
( E I vol VIH p. 36 at p 44 ) Kant ( IV 1 ) says that those 
who sweep the dust ( near mines &c ) should get one-third of 
the valuable things found and the king should get two-thirds 
and all jewels The king had also monopolies in certain 
matters He alone could catch elephants. Kaut (II 31-32) 
and Manasollasa (JL 3, pp 44-58) deal with this matter, the 
latter describing several methods of catching elephants. 
Medbatithi" 5 on Manu Vm 400 says that kings have a 
monopoly as to elephants because it is well-known that they 
are most useful to them and he specifies certain monopolies 
such as those in saffron, silken cloth and wool, horses, pearls, 
and jewels. Megasthenes (fragment XXXVI p. 90) states 
that a private person was not allowed to keep an elephant or a 
horse and that those animals were held to be the special 
property of the king 

The king recovered a sort of road cess through officers 
called antapala ( guardians of borders or boundaries ) viz 1J 
nana on each cast loaded with merchandise, half a pana on 
each head of cattle, £th pana on minor quadrupeds, and one 
mam on a load carried on a man's shoulders (Kaut. EL 21 p 111) 
Sukra IV. 2. 129 permits for the repairs to the 10 ads a tax on 
those who use roads Revenues were raised in numerous other 
ways such as by charging for stamping weights and measures 
by fees levied from keepers of gambling halls, from players

The RajataranginI (VH. 1008) notices that a tax was 
levied on Kashmirians performing sraddha at Gaya An inscrip- 
tion of Vikramaditya V found near Gadag dated iahe 934 
( 1012-13 A. D. ) refers to taxes levied on upanayana, marriages, 
vedic sacrifices &c. ( E X vol 20 p. 64 }. Zt appears that the 
king of AnahilavSd, Siddharaja (1094-1143 A. D ), levied a tax 
on pilgrims going to Somanatha at the frontier town Bahuloda 
and it is said that the tax yielded 78 lakhs of rupees a year, 
which Siddharaja remitted for the sake of and at the inter- 
vention of his mother ; vide Bom G. vol I part 1 p. 112 and 
Prabandha-cintamani (p. 84, Tawney ) The amount is probably 
very highly exaggerated in order to glorify Siddharaja, but 
this shows that the yield of the pilgrim tax must have been 
substantial The Manasollasa in its great desire to help the 
king with the accumulation of wealth advises the king even to 
resort to alchemy * ss 

A question may be asked, what were the means of preven- 
ting a king from being over-exacting and tyrannical in his 
taxes? Kant (VH. 5 pp Z76-277) cites at great length 
the causes that lead to the impoverishment of the subjects, to 
their being greedy and disaffected Among these he mentions ■ 
' not paying what ought to be paid and exacting what ought not 
to be exacted, not punishing the guilty and severely punishing 
the guilty, not protecting the people against thieves ana 
robbing tliem of their wealth ' He then states that when tne 
subjects become impoverished they become greedy and when 
greedy they become disaffected and voluntarily go over to tne 
side of the king's enemy or destroy their own king In another

deterrents against the tyranny of heavy taxation according

who bore the brunt of taxation ) were neglected, they may dis- 
appear from the country and dwell in forests. Mann ( VII 111- 
112 ) warns kings who through folly rashly oppress then king- 
doms that &ey may ere long lose their own lives and those of their 
relatives and also their kingdoms Yaj. (1 340-341) is even 
more emphatic and says that the king who seeks to increase his 
treasury with wealth extracted by unjust means from his realm 
loses his wealth in no time and meets destruction along with 
his relatives. ' The fire springing from the wrath caused by the 
harassment of the subjects does not cease without burning the 
family, the wealth and the life of the king.' Katyayana (v. 19) 
harps on the spiritual consequences: ' the king who unjustly 
takes from his kingdom taxes, fines, share of crops and tolls, 
incurs 8 " sin.' Sukra M ' (IL 319-321 and 370) emphasizes 
the keeping of daily, monthly and yearly accounts and the 
entering of the several items of income on the left side of the 
account and of those of expenditure on the right. The 
Kftivakyamrta 84 '* refers to the appointment of auditors when 
there is discrepancy in the items of income and expenditure.

to bo tho Commander m Bg VI 75 is full of references to 
J>ows, arrows, armour, bow-strings, quiver, charioteer, horses, 
chariots &c. KCim ( XIII 34-37 ) states that the king posted

supports his own subjects and is depended upon even by his 
enemies All the following result from the possession of a

enemies and of the ( king's ) territories, prompt attainment of 
objects that seemed distant, protection of what is already secur- 
ed, destruction of the armies of the enemy, the keeping together 
of one's army Most authorities agree in saying that troops are 
of six kinds viz memta ( hereditary ), Mirfa or bhrtaki or UitHI" 
(hired troops), si cm ( guild troops ), vutia ( troops of an ally or 
friendly power or feudatories), nmttia ( troops that once belonged 
to the enemy), atati or atattka ( wild tribes as troops ) Vide 
Kaut ME IX. 2 (first sentence ), Kam. XVDI 4, Agnipurana 342

bay that each earlier variety of troops is superior to eacli later 
one Mmtta troops coiresponded to the modern standing array, 
since Kaut ( IX 2) prefers them on the ground that they depend 
on the king for maintenance and are being constantly drilled 
They most probably consisted of persons who and whose ancestors 
got tax-free lands in lieu of military service The Sabha- 
narva 5. 63 appears to refer to four kinds ( omitting sremano

vifecctos and similar castes dwelling in the vicinity of mountains 
and armtra troops as soldiers who once belonged to an enemy king 
tot being defeated were taken captive and made slaves. Accord- 
ing to the Kajanttiratnakara ( p 38 ) * aribala* means ' troops that 
crnne to a king after leaving the king's enemy '. K&m. XVHI 7 
says that the at&vika troops are, by nature, irreligious, greedy, 
unarm and uon-observers of truth. They correspond to the 
ivmlham and freebooters of later times The reasons why hered- 
itary and other troops are superior to amifcra and atavika varie- 
tiss are explained at great length by Kaut. IX. 2 and Earn. XSrHL 
W. Kant. (IX. 2) states that an amtfart army led by anarya 
is superior to wild tribe troops Both of them are out for plunder 
attft in case no plunder can be had or when there is a 
disaster they may prove as dangerous as Bnakes. By srenl-bala 
he has in mind the organized bands of soldiers to whom he 
refers elsewhere as ' vaitasastropajlvinah ' (vide p. 89 above). 
As it is not unlikely that members of trade-guilds either them- 
selves learnt the profession of arms or engaged soldiers for the 
protection of their merchandise and property, these could be 
pressed into his service by a king in case of need and were 
distinguished from the hereditary army and hired troops as 
' srenl-bala '. Differing from the Scurj/as that troops composed of 
brshmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sfidras are superior for en- 
listment in the order of the castes, Kaut holds that an army of 
ksatriyas well-trained in the wielding of arms or an army of

question whether brahmanas could become soldiers In Udyoga-

bhava every day asked in the morning whether there was any 
sudra, vaisya, ksatriya or brahmana equal or superior to him 
in armed conflict That showB that soldiers of casteB other 
than ksatriyas were not unheard of in the Epic age Earn IV. 
(63,65,67) says that the hereditary army (pitr-paitamaha) 
should consist mostly of ksatriyas In the Maliya copperplate 
of Maharaja Dharasena H (252 Valabhi samvat i. e. 571-72 
A. D. ) Bhatarka, the founder of the Valabhi dynasty, is 
said to have secured the kingdom with the help of maula, 
bhrta, mitra and sreni troops (Gupta Inscriptions p. 165). 
Sukra ( IL 137-139 ) says that the soldiers may be sudras, 
ksatriyas, vaisyas, mlecchas or of mixed castes, provided, they 
are brave, restrained, well-built, devoted to their master and 
their dharma, and hate the enemy. Santi(101 3-5 ) describes 
in what respects soldiers from Gsndhara, Sindhu and other 
countries and Yavana and Deccan soldiers excel, remarks that 
brave and strong men are to be found everywhere (verse 6) 
and that men from the border ( i e. bktUas and kaivarias accord- 
ing to Nflakantha ) are desperate fighters, would never run 
away from battle and so should be preferred for enlistment 
in the army (verse 19). The Yasastilaka III (pp 461-467) 
describes the characteristics of Northern Indian (auttarapatha), 
Deccan (daksinatya), Dramila (South Indian), Tirhnt (Taira-

Vide Santi 121. 44 also In the Mahabharata elephants do not, 
except in Tare cases, play any role in the fighting that went 
on, while chariots and the other arms of an army are described 
everywhere. In the Virataparva ( 65, 6 ) Vikarna waB seated 
on an elephant when he attacked Arjuna; BMsmaparva 20. 7 
refers to Doryodhana as riding an elephant and (95.32-33) 
Bhagadatta is described as seated on an elephant when he 
attacked Bhlma In this respect the Epic carries on the 
vedio tradition Megasthenes (Fragment 1 p. 30) notes that 
in ancient India elephants were trained for war and 
turned the Ecale of victory. Vast armies were kept by ancient 
kings and emperors. When Satrughna Btarted against the 
demon Lavana he had an army of 4000 horses, 2000 chariots 
and 100 elephants with him (Kamayana VH. 64 2-4). In the

155 U further notes that each horseman was surrounded by- 
ten men as attendants (nar&dasa hayascasan padaraksah 
samantatah). Though throughout the centuries the infantry- 
was theoretically and in practice more numerous than cavalry, 
not much importance seems to have been attached to them as 
compared with chariots or horsemen. The lexicon called 
Vaijayanti says that patti consists of three horses^ five foot- 
soldiers, one chariot and one elephant, that three pattis are equal 
to senamukha and that senamukha, gulma, gana, vdhint, prtana, 
cama, anikinl represent each three times as many as the 
preceding one and that 10 aniktnfe are equal to an aksa\ihin5 
The Nitiprakasika* 71 ' gives a table of groups from ;«(// to 
uksaulmii and Temarks that each of these groups had in turn 
numerous supporting men e g each elephant was followed by a 
hundred horsemen and a thousand foot-soldiers and each hoTse- 
man was supported by a thousand toot-soldiers ( VH. 3-10) 
Manu VII. 192 refers to battles on water also. Froru. references. 
intheMahabharatait appears that chariots had only two wheels 
Vide Bhlsma 98 47, Dronaparva 154 3, SalyalG 24(Saineyo

warriors were told oft to guard the two wheels of the chariot of 
the principal commanders and are called ' cakra-raksau ' 
(vide Bhfema 54. 76, 108 5, Drona 91, 36, Kama 11. 31, 34. 44 ). 
Chariots 'if great warriors were drawn by four horses e g

chariots had small tinkling bells attached to them and also 
screens of tiger-skin The Bg contains very graphic descriptions 
of chariots. Chariots were generally drawn hy two horses in the 
vedicage(Rg V 30 1, V 36 5, VI 23 1) and had two wheels, hut 
the chariot of the Asvins is described as having three wheels 
Utg. I. 118. 2, L 157. 3.X. 41 1) Ghatotkaca, however, had 
eight wheels to his chariot (Drona 156. 61, 175 13). The

BothNar (sambhuya-22) and Br state that among persons

( JJ 6. 566-569 p 80) describes that the chiefs of the hereditary 
army should always be honoured by the king with presents 
of jewels, ornaments, costly clothes and sweet words and 
sumptuous provision for their maintenance should he made 
by bestowing on them a village, or two or more villageb 
and heaps of gold, while hired soldiers should be paid every day 
or ovory month or once in three, four or six months or once in a 
year according to the needs of the king Megasthenes ( frag- 
ment XXXIV p. 88 ) describes the organization of the Indian 
army : ' A third governing body directs military afiaire, of 
which there were six divisions with five members to each One 
co-operates with the admiral of the fleet, another, with the 
superintendent of bullock trains, the third division has charge

for payments made to them and tbey should he furnished with a 
writing about their pay. Some of these rules are very old. 
The Udyogaparva*" 37. 30 mentions among persons with 
whom no contractual transactions should he entered into, the 
king, the king's servants and soldiers 

The Aithasastra contains an elaborate discussion ( in IX. 
1-7 and X. 1-6 ) about the organization of the king's army, the 
proper time and place for starting on an invasion, internal and 
external troubles and calamities and measures against them, 
means of dealing with traitors and enemies, religious remedies 
(worshipping gods and falling at the feet of brahmanas, magical 
rites based upon the Atharvaveda) against misfortunes like fire 
and flood, epidemics, famine &c, encampment ( skandhavara ) of 
armies, treacherous and strategic fighting, proper battle grounds, 
encouragement to one's own army, free labourers and their 
work, different arrangements or formations ( vyuhas ) of armies. 
Considerations of space prevent any treatment of these matters. 
But a few notable points will be set out here. A king may 
mvade bis enemy's country either in Margasirsa { when the 
crops sown in the rains are ready) or in Caitra or when the 
enemy is suffering from some calamity. Santi { 100. 10-11 ) 
says the same thing. Internal trouble arises when any minister 
puroMj, sempaU or the crown prince is angry or dissatisfied 
with the king, who should get rid of such trouble by giving up 
his own fault or by pointing out the danger arising from an 
enemy If the crown prince causes trouble he should be kept 
m confinement or killed, if ibere is another son of good character. 
l*e trouble caused by a provincial Governor or the officer in 
charge of boundaries (antapsla), the chief of wild tribes or a 
conquered king is termed external. The king should meet it by 
settragup one against the other. The encampment of an army

195. 12-19 ( cr ed 196 12-19 ) it appears that markets, prosti- 
tutes, conveyances, oxen, machines, arms and physicians 
accompanied an army and that the camp (senanivesa or 
skandhavara ) of Duryodhana looked like the capital itself and 
was five yojanas in extent Physicians with surgical instruments, 
blnnt instruments ( like tweezers ), medicines, curative oils and 
bandages in their hands and women ( nurses ) looking after the 
.food and drink of the army should stand behind the soldiers

120 55 also states that doctors well-veised in extracting 
splinters or arrow-heads ( from the body ) approached with their 
surgical instruments to extract the darts from Bhlsma's body 
The duties of the labourers (matt) were to examine the camp, 
roads, bridges, wells, and river glials, to carry machines, weapons, ^ 
armour, utensils, fodder, to remove from the battle-field wounded 
men along with their weapons and armour. 275 Each commander 
had some distinguishing device as his banner e. g Bhisma had 
a golden tala tree as his standard (Bhlsmaparva VI 17 18,

HI ] High ideals in warfare 209 

Mahabharata holds up a high ideal. The Bhlsmaparva K4 21. 30 
remarks that conquerors do riot secure victory so much by their 
armies and proweBS as by truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, 
the observance of dharma and energetic actions. The Santi- 
parva ( 95. 17-18 ) states that it is better to die while fighting 
according to the' rules of dharma Tather than obtain a victory 
by •wicked actions. 

In the Bhismaparva ( 1. 27-32 ) certain rules of -war agreed 
upon between the Kauravas and the Pandavas are set ont, such as 
one should fight only with one similarly equipped ( i e. a foot- 
soldier with a foot-soldier and so on), one should not kill a soldier 
who is already in combat with another, or who has turned back 
from fight or is without amour. Sp Dh. S. II. 5. 10. 12, Gaut. 
X. 17-18, Yaj L 326, Manu VH. 90-93, Santi 95. 7-14, 96.3, Santi

contain rules of war dictated by noble sentiments of 
humanity and chivalry. Some of these ( that will bear 
comparison with the conventions of the Geneva and Hague 
Conferences ) are set out here Gaut. ( X 17-18 ) * 7S states : "no 
sin is committed by injuring or slaying men in battle 
excepting him who has lost his horse, charioteer or weapons 
him who joins his hands (in supplication for life ), whose hair* 
are dishevelled ( in flying ), who turns away from the field, who 
sits down, who climbs an eminence or a tree ( in flight ) except 
envoys or messengers, except him who declares himself to be a

( or concealed ) weapons, or with barbed or poisoned weapons or 
with weapons the points of which are blazing with fire. Let a 
fighter not strike one who has climbed on an eminence, nor a 
eunuch, nor one who joins the palms of his hand ( in supplica- 
tion ), nor one with flying hair ( in flight ), nor one who Bits 
down or says ' I am thine ', nor one who is asleep, nor one who 
has lost armour, nor one who is naked or disarmed, nor^one who 
is merely looking on without taking part in the fight, nor one 
who is fighting with another foe, nor one whose weapons are 
broken, nor one who is afflicted with sorrow, nor one seriously 
wounded, nor one who is in fear, nor one who has turned to flee ' 
Sankha adds that a soldier Bhould not kill another while the 
latter is drinking water or taking his meals or is taking off his 
shoes, nor should one kill a woman, a female elephant, nor a 
charioteer, nor a bard nor a brahmana nor should one who is 
not a king { or noble ) kill one who is a king Baud. Eh S 1 
10 10 forbids the use of poisoned or barbed arrows (tarnm) 
Santi 95. 11 also does the same. Santi ( 95 13-U J enjoins that 
oven an enemy soldier, when wounded, should be treated with 
medicine and allowed to go when his wounds are healed * 
Santi adds that a soldier should not kill boys or old men nor from 
behind nor ofae who holds a blade of grass in his mouth ( as a 
mark of submission ) These rules, though probably ideal and 
not strictly followed in every case, are far more humane as 
compared with the practice in modern warfare when non- 
combatants are killed from the air even at night without warn- 
ing In ancient times non-combatants went generally un- 
molested, to which Megasthenes bears testimony when he sayB 
(Frag Lp 33 ) 'Tillers of the soil even when battle is raging 
in the neighbourhood are undisturbed by any sense of danger, 
for the combatants allow those engaged in husbandry to renmw

numerous breaches of morality and the chivalrous rules of war 
{ such as the slaying of Ahhimanyu by many engaging him at 
one time ). The general rule was that fighting ceased when the 
sun went down ( Bhlsma 49. 52-53 ). But in Dronaparva \ 54 
and 163. 16 ff we have a description of night battles and it is 
provided that chariots, elephants and horses should carry lamps. 

It has already been shown how it was the duty of a 
ksatriya and of every soldier to fight and die in battle rather 
than run away. A fighting spirit was inculcated by holding 
out several rewards. One was the acquisition of booty and 
territory (Gaut. X. 41, Manu VIL 206, Bhagavadglta H. 37); 
others were the satisfaction of having done one*B duty as a 
ksatriya (GltalL 31-33), honour and fame (Glta 11.34-35), 
heaven and other-worldly rewards (Yaj. I 324, Manu VII. 88-89 ), 
protection of brahmanas ( Ap. Dh S. II 10. 26. 2-3 ). Visnu Dh 
S HL 44-46 have already been quoted above (p 58 ). The 
Santi (98. 40-41) states that a soldier who runB away from the 
field falls into Hell. Ya) (I 324-325) declares that those who, 
while fighting with weapons that are not treacherous (poisoned 
&o.) for the sake of the land (of their master or of the enemy) 
die in battle without turning back from it go to heaven like 
yogms, that each step of those who do not flee even when their 
comrades have been killed is equal to a solemn sacrifice ( like 
theAsvamedha), the king (the master) takes away all the 
merit of those who run away from the battlefield and are then 
killed. Manu VIL 95 contains the same idea These remarks 
were applicable not only to ksatriya soldiers, but to soldiers of 
all castes who maintained themselves by following the pro- 
fession of arms Vide Ra janltiprakasa p. 407. Parasara (HL 31) 
and Brhat-Parasara X. p 281 remark that a valiant soldier who 
does not seek mercy though surrounded by many enemies and 
falls fighting attains imperishable worlds and that when he 
reaches heaven divine damsels run after him to choose him as 
their Lord ( UL 34-35 ) Parasara HL 36 is a «" verse which is

one of the two quoted by Kaut (X 3) when soldiers are to be 
urged on to fight Kautilya ( in X 3 ) advises that the king him- 
self and his mantim and purolata should urge on his soldiers by 
quoting Vedic and classical Sanskrit passages about the rewards 
waiting for those who fall fighting for their master and the 
religious punishments for those who run away Astrologers 
should infuse spirit into their side by asserting that the heavenly 
aspects favour theii side The day before the battle the king 
should observe a fast, offer oblations into fire to the accom- 
paniment of Atharvaveda manltas and cause benedictory tests 
to be repeated that refer to victory Bards should recite lays 
describing heaven as the reward for the brave and hell for the 
timid and extol the caste, guild, family, deeds and character of 
the soldiers The assistants of the pnrohita should declare that 
they have practised witchcraft against the enemy. The commander- 
in-chief and the officers under him should address the army &t, 
follows — 'a hundred thousand (panas) will be the reward for him 
who kills the enemy king, fifty thousand for him who kills 
the commander-in-chief or the crown prince, . a hundred 
for slaying the officer of the patti (a battalion), twenty for 
bringing the head (of a common soldier) and twice the pay and 
the booty seized by each to all soldiers' Kam (XIX 18-21) 
says that the king should give the rewards (promised asm 
Kaut ) to the soldiers after they succeed in the exploits men- 
tioned Vide also Manasollasa U 20 verses 1163-1167 (pp 133- 
134) for similar promises Gaut (X £0-33) prescribes that 
whatever wealth is acquired by a soldier by his individual effort 
should be given to him by the king, but the horse or elephant 
caught by a soldier goes to the king, that if many soldiers by a 
joint effort obtain some valuable plunder the king should choose 
and retain the best for himself and the rest should be divided 
among the soldiers according to their services in the tattle

elephant to be retained as booty by the soldier and everything 
else including female slaves, except jewels, gold and silver j,

krpana (probably a dagger, inX 22 10), vajra made of ayas

arrows In the Atharvaveda 87 * L 16. 2 and 4 reference is made 
to lead as destroying sorcerers and it is said ' if you kill our 
cow or horse or man we shall pierce you with lead so that you 
will cease to kill our strong men*. In Tai S. I. 5 7. 6 it is 
said 880 that when a samtdh is offered into fire with the mantra 
' indhanas-tv5 Satam himah.' the sacrificar discharges against his 
enemy the sataghnl ( weapon killing a hundred) which acts like 
vajra itself. Dr. Oppert in his Introduction to the Nltiprakasika 
pp 10-13 relies on these and other passages for holding that the 
ancientlndians knew fire-arms and that Atharvaveda 1 16.4 refers 
to leaden balls discharged from cylinders. Vide Dr. Oppert's work 
on the 'weapons, army organisation and political maxims of the 
ancient Hindus' (1880), where he describes several weapons and 
holds that gunpowder was known in India long before the 13th 
century A. D. Mr. G.T. Date's 'Art of war in Ancient India' 
(London 1929 ), Dr. P. C. Ohakravarti's work ( 1941, Dacca) and 
Prof. Dikshitar'B book on the same subject may be consulted for

written in the 13th or 14th century when cannon came to be 
used in Europe for the first time Both in the Ramfiyana and 
the Mahabharata the word iataghni ( killing a hundred people ) 
occurs frequently. In the Yuddhakanda" 1 3 13 it is stated 
that at the gates of Lanka hundreds of iron sataghnfe, looking 
burnished, sharp and terrible, had been arranged by the demons. 
In a poetic description of Lanka in the Sundarakanda chap 2, it 
is said that sataghnls and sulas were like the hair on the head of 
I anka (verse 21). In the Vanaparva 15 there is a fine description 
of DvaravatI (DvarkS) besieged by Salva, in which it is said that 
the capital had numerous towers and turrets, machines, tomaras, 
ankusas, sataghnls &c In Adi. 207. 34, Vanaparva 169. 16, 284, 5, 
290 24, Dronal56 70, Kama 11. 8, Salya45 110 the sataghnl is 
mentioned, but it iB impossible to find from these what exactly it 
was like From Vanaparva 284 31 it appears that the sataghnls 
were discharged with force by the hands and had wheels and 
round balls or stones in it. In Drona 179. 46 it iB said that 
the sataghnl employed by Ghatotkaca had wheels and killed 
four horses at once In Djrona 199 1 9 sataghnls are said to have 
two or four wheels. In Vanaparva*" 284 4 it is said that the 
powder of sarjarasa ( resin from Sal tree ) bad been collected 
In the Harivamia ( Bhavisyaparva 44 20 ), among the weapons 
hurled at Narasimha by Hiranyakasipu were blazing sataghnls 
(sataghnlbhisca dlptabhir-dandairapi sudarunaih) In Ramayana 
VJL32 44 we are told that at the tip of the weapon called 
musala ( club ) blazed forth fire like a bunch of Asoka flowers. 
The Sundarakanda couples together iataghni and musala ( 4. 18 }. 
It looks probable that resinous powder was used in some 
cylindrical contrivance ( or rockets ) mounted on wheels and 
capable of throwing stones. But gunpowder appears not to have 
been used There is no description of smoke due to sataghnls. 
Hopkins (J. A. O.S Xm pp 299-303) holds that gunpowder 
and fire-arms were unknown to the great Epic and in the present 
Btate of our knowledge this view seems to be correct.

numerous weapons divid ed into four classes via nuOta ( thrown

oi discharged such as arrows), amuMa (not thrown such as 
swords ),.naiktamiikta ( thrown and -not thrown, such as aslras 
which after discharge can he taken back) and mantramukta 
( astras which cannot be taken back ). The Agnipurana ( 249- 
252 ) and the "Visnudhannottara ( II 178-182) give a summary 
of the Dhanurveda (both agreeing almost word for word, but 
the latter containing more verses than the former ) and Bpeak 
of five kinds of weapons viz yantramukta ( discharged from a 
machine, a sling, bow &c, ), panimukta ( thrown with the hand 
such as a stone or tamara ), muktamukta ( like a prasa ), amukta 
( sword ) and niyuddha or bakuyuddha ( wrestling ). The science 
of astras was of a supernatural kind. In the epics and puranas, 
the great heroes are said to have learnt aslruixdya either from a 
teacher or from their father or by practising austerities and 
sometimes (as in the case of Kusa and Lava) certain astras pass 
to the son by the mere fact of his birth and the wish of his father. 
Whether the Dhanurveda often referred to in the epics had consign- 
ed this science of astras to writing and could have enabled a 
reader to possess the miraculous powers attributed to astras is more 
than a modern can say. The Agnipur5na(chap. 134-135) contains 
magical incantations for victory in war and conquest of the 
worlds. The Parasuramaprafcapa ( Rajavallabhakanda folios 
9-12 ) contains numerous mantras and yantras and -incanta- 
tions derived from Tantra works like the Brahmayamala.

CHAPTER IX 

SUHRT OR MITRA (ALLY OR FRIEND). 

Maim inculcates the necessity of making friends in VII 208 
and cites the qualities of a good friend (for a king) ' a king 
does not prosper by the acquisition of gold and land bo much as 
by securing a firm friend who would be powerful m future, 
though he may be of depleted resources at the time, That friend,' 
though a weak one, is commended, who is righteous, grateful] 
whose subjecbs (or ministers) are contented, who is attached 
and who pursues (to the end) work undertaken ' According to 
Manu VII. 206 land, gold and ally are the three fruits of royal 
endeavour or policy. Yaj I 353 is similar to Manu VII. 208. 
In Vn. 9 Kautilya in opposition to the above holds that the 
acquisition of land is better than that of gold and friend and tho 
acquisition of gold is superior to that of a friend 23 *. The Maha- 
bharata (SSnti 138.110) states 'no one is the friend or enemy of 
any one else; friends or enemies are made by wealth (or objects 
pursued by a person) , . 385 Zsm. Vm 5Z says the same. Sukra. 
(IV. 1. 8-10 ) opines 'in the case of a brave, energetic, strong and 
politic king all others, though outwardly friendly, secretly 
cherish enmity to him and only wait for (the proper) time (to 
strike ) There is no wonder in this. Are they not themselves 
greedy of conquering territories? A king has no friend and ha 
is the friend of none'. Santi (80. 3) Bays 286 that a friend is of 
four kinds, one who has the same goal, one who comes for protec- 
tion or security, one who is naturally so and one who is acqui- 
red. £arnaparva 88. 28 gives the four kinds somewhat diffe- 
rently viz. natural (sahaja), acquired by conciliatory words,

won by wealth and one drawn by one's prowess. Kam. ( IV. 74 ) 
says that a mitra is of four kinds viz. by birth (such as one's 
father's father, mother &c), made by relationship (i. e. 
marriage), hereditary (one's father's friend), one who is saved 
from calamities. 337 According to Kfim, (IV. 75-76 ) the qualities 
of a friendly king are purity (of heart), liberality, bravery, 
sharing happiness and sorrow, affection, vigilance (to carry 
out one's friend's object), truth; and briefly the characteristic 
of a true friend is devotion to the objects desired by his friend 
The purpose for which a friend is made is to secure one of the 
three purusSrthas, dharma, artha and kama ( Kam. IV. 72 ). 

This subject of making friends leads on to the well-known 
theory of mandala i. e. of inter-state relationship. Kaut. VI. 2 
and VH, Manu VII. 154-211, Asramvasiparva 6-7, Yaj. I 345- 
348, Kam. V3H-XI, Agnipurana 233 and 240, Visnudharmottara 
H. 145-150, Nitivakyamrta pp. 317-343, Rajanltiprakasapp. 316- 
330, Nltimayukha pp. 44-46 deal with this theory of mandala 
and the six gtiyas at great length. As the Kautillya is probably 
the earliest of these and contains the most elaborate treatment 
of ike subject, a brief outline from it is presented here. The 
Nitivakyamrta (pp. 311-313) copies the very words of Kautilya. 

The yogaksema (welfare) of a State springs from peace 
(sama) and exertion (vyay&ma). The latter achieves the com- 
pletion of works undertaken, while sama brings about the undis- 
turbed enjoyment of the frnits of undertakings. The (proper) 
employment of the six guvas (sandlu &c. ) is the source of sama 
andvyayama What results (udaya) from these six gunas is 
either deterioration, stagnation -or progress. Udaya depends 
upon human and divine causes which together govern the world, 
lue human ones are jiaya and apanaya Human causes are seen 
(anticipated) and can be operated- (by men). Naya (good 
policy) is that out of the human causes from which results 
yogaksema (welfare); apanaya i impolitic way) is that which 
produces loss (or an unfavourable state). ' In VI 1 (last verse)

is called ^tgisu, (the ambitious mler or conqueror). Ktm vm

who ha S ^t energy and who makes great efforts. Invent 
7-11 he mentions at length his qualities. All our works place 
before kings this ideal of conquest, domination or self-aggran- 
dizement at the expense of one's weak neighbours A vbigisu 
is a tang who is endowed with good qualities ( called atmasampat 
on p 45 above) and with the several elements of the State and 
who is the fountain of policy (naya), ie. who has a definite good 
policy to purmie. An an ( actual or potential enemy ) is a king 
or kings who are the immediate neighbours on the circum- 
ference of the kingdom of the vijiglsu. From this it follows 
that an may comprehend one king, two kings or more who are 
the immediate neighbours of the vijiglsu. But it should db 
remembered as insisted upon by the Nltivakyfimrta 2S '(p.321 
that there is no inflexible rule that the immediate neighbour is an 
enemy and that the king whose dominion is beyond the imme- 
diate neighbour will be a friend. Contiguity or distance is not 
necessarily the cause of friendship or enmity, but rather it ib 
the purpose ( or object) that makes friends or enemies. All that 
is meant is that the immediate neighbour is most likely to be an 
t a i ( a real or potential enemy ). A mitra ( friend of the vijiglsu) 
is he who is separated (from the vijiglsu) by the intervention of 
the kingdom of the an A sali-u is a neighbouring ruler posses- 
sed of the characteristics of an enemy 290 (detailed in Kaut.

that in the terminology of Kautilya an is a generic expression 
including actual and potential enemies who will generally bo 
on the borders of the kingdom of the vijiglsu. A iatru is an art 
who invites attack or destruction or harassment or reduction

attacked and is then called yataeya 291 ; one who has no support or 
has only a weak support is to he extirpated ; an enemy who is the 
opposite of this last (i.e. who has a support or strong support) is 
to be either harassed or to he reduced. Support { asraya ) means 
a strong fort or a good friend ( Kam. Vm. 60 ). So that a ialru 
is of four sorts (yatavya, ucchedya, pldanlya, karsanlya). 
Harassment is caused to him who is without mantra and a strong 
army, while one who is strong in mantta and army is to be 
rendered weak in these respects. Both a i atru or a mtra are of 
three kinds, sahaja, krlrima and prakrta. A sahaja (natural) 
friend iB one who is related through one's parents ( such as 
maternal or paternal aunt's son); one who is resorted to for wealth 
or safety is krtrima( acquired) i. e. one who has obliged the 
vijiglsu or has been under his obligations; and the king who is 
next to the neighbour ( i. e. who is separated from the vijiglsu 
by the intervention of the neighbour king) is prakrta (i. e. 
because he is a prakrti, an element in the mandala theory ). 
A sahaja enemy is one who is born of the same family ( such as 
a step-brother), a krlrima is one who is antagonistic or incites 
antagonists ( i. e. one who has caused harm to or who has been 
harmed by the vijiglsu), while the immediate neighbour is a 
prakrta enemy. The Mit. on Yaj. L 345 very concisely hut 
lucidly explains all these and the four kinds of satru. The 
Visnudharmottara (IL 145. 15-16) and the Agnipurana (233. 
21-83) say that in their opinion the prakrta is really krtrima. 
Kam. Vm. 56 also speaks of only two, sahaja and hrtnma. 
Although it is poBBible that the vijiglsu's realm is surrounded 
by many kings, the one who is taken for discussion is the enemy 
and is to be regarded as in front (purastSt) of the vijiglsu. 
Therefore in front of the vijiglsu come in order the ari ( imme- 
diate neighbour), then the mitra (whose domain is next 
after that of the ari), then the arimitra (the friend of the 
enemy who will be immediately after the mitra of the vijiglsu 
and bo will be the enemy of the mitra), then comes the mitra- 
mUra (friend of the friend of the vijiglsu) and then arimitra- 
mitra (ally of the enemy's friend). "When the ari is said

to be in front of the vij'iglsu, the ruler of the territory 
in the opposite direction is said to be in the rear of the vijiglsu 
(paiait) and is called parsmgralia^ 2 (lit one who may 
seize or attack the heels ) He is really an enemy but this special 
term is applied to him and be causes trouble in the realm of the 
vi]iglsu when the latter has started on an invasion or is about to 
start on one. The king who is the ruler of the country beyond 
the parsnigraha is called Ukranda ( lit one for whose help a cry 
is or may be raised by the vijiglsu ). He would ordinarily be a 
friend being separated from the vijiglsu by the realm of the 
parsnigraha. The friend of the parsnigraha ( who would be 
immediately next after the akranda ) is called parsnigrahasara 
and the friend of the akranda who would be beyond the pars- 
nigrahasara is called akrandasara A madhyama^ 3 king is one 
whose realm is close to ( is on the border of ) that of the vijiglsu 
and that of the an ( the immediate enemy in front ) and who is 
capable of helping ( or favouring ) both of them whether^ both 
are combined in alliance or not and who is capable of resisting 
either of them individually when the two are not in combina- 
tion. An udasina king is generally defined as one whose 
territory is beyond or outside of the sphere of the realms of the 
yijiglsu, his enemy in front and the madhyama, who is -very 
strong on account of his elements of sovereignty, is capable of 
helping the above three kings whether they be in combination 
or not and who is capable of resisting any of the three when 
they are not in combination Kulluka on Manu. YE 153 
differs from this explanation i.e the udaslna is a powerful king 
whose realm may he 'situated in front or in the rear or even at 
a distance from that of the vijiglsu, but he is indifferent for some 
reason or other to the activities of the vijiglsu. The Mit on Yaj 
I. 345 observes that the udaslna also is of three kinds and tno 
prakrta udaslna is the overlord of the State that is separated from 
the central state (vijiglsu) by two intervening States; the

maflhyama ( or madhyastha ace. to Nitivakyamrta p. 318 ) is the 
immediate neighbour of both the vijiglsu and his enemy, 
but wants to remain neuttal in the conflict of the two for some 
reason It will have been noticed that the vijiglsu, tbe enemy, the 
madhyama and the udaslna axe independent catagories, while 
four out of the remaining eight others viz. mitia, mitramitm 
akianda, akrandasara can be grouped under vijiglsu, while the 
other four viz arimitra, arimitramitra, parsnigraha and parsni- 
grahasara may be grouped under ari. It is therefore that Mami 
(Yn. 155-156) speaks of the four prakitis (vijiglsu, satru, 
madhyama and udaslna ) as the mula (basis) of the mandala 
theory and Kam. VIE 20 informs us that Maya declared that a 
mandala was constituted by these four, Kam VUL 86 gives 
it as his own opinion that mandala is constituted by mitra, 
ndaslna and i ipu, ( enemy ) only ** Kautilya says that the man- 
dala is constituted as explained above by twelve ptakrtis TJsa- 
nas was of the same opinion (Kam. VUL 22) and Kam. (VUL 41) 
states that there were numerous views about the number of the 
elements of the mandala, but a mandala of twelve kings is 
quite clear and well-known among all people 295 Kam. (VHT 
20-41) explains how by various combinations of the elements 
of the mandala with some elements of sovereignty (viz minis- 
ters, TSstra, ducga; kosa, bala) different writers held that the 
mandala comprised 18, 26, 54, 72, 108 and other numbers of 
prakrtis The Sarasvativilasa (pp 37-41) shows how from 
different standpoints Usanas himself argued that the mandala 
was constituted by one prakrti, two, three, 10, 21, 108 and that 
other wnters speak also of 4, 5, 6, 14, 18, 30, 36, 44, 60 72 
prakrtis All these figures are due to the inveterate haS of 
scholastic minds to run an idea to the earth and to indulge in 
divisions and sub-divisions. Even Mami { VJL 157 ) states that 
comb ning each of the twelve members of mandaia w X! 
five elements of sovereignty from amatya onwards wTget 60 
which with the twelve- come to 72. It is JTZTSSflS

Dasakumaracarita (VHI p 144) refers when speaking of the 
tree of naya that it has 72 prakrtis as its leaves ( dvisaptatipra- 
krtipatrah nayavanaspatih ). The central idea of the man- 
dala was to keep a balance of power among a circle of 
States, some being friendly among themselves owing to 
their position and surroundings, while others would form 
an antagonistic group Kaut (VI 2) also refers to thw 
number 73, out of which twelve are constituted by kings 
( rajapiakrhs ) and 60 ( five sovereignty elements of each of the 
twelve ) are styled ( diaujctpiahrtrs ) The Santiparva (59 70-71) 
also refers to a mandala of 12 kings and to the number 72 
Vide N. N Law's ' Studies in Ancient Hindu Polity ' pp 195-208 
for elucidation of the theory of mandala The theory of 
mandala has this element of truth in it that on a calculation of 
probabilities the kings who are the immediate neighbours of a 
ruler are likely to be his enemies ( at least potential ) and the 
kings that are beyond the immediate neighbours may make 
common cause with the central State taken for discourse in order 
to crush between them a hostile intermediate State It suggests 
that diplomacy may take the lines indicated by position and 
probabilities The diagram below will 2 " illustrate the idea 
Manu (VE 177 and 180) declares that (state) policy consists briefly 
in this that a'king must so arrange all things or means that 
the ally, the udasina and the satru cannot harm him or become 
superior to him Medhatithi ( on Manu VH 177 ) remarks that 
even an ally may become an enemy if his interest so require* 
(MKcrtliagattvaiaccnmitiamapijanibhaiati) 

Kautilya^relates the theory of mandala to the theory of tauis 
(already referred to onp 171) and the six-fold policy (sadganya)

Everything secures success (i.e. Mb and his kingdom's happiness) 
according as the king is able to put forth each of the saktis to 
their utmost. The aspiring king taking into account his three 
saktismay employ the six gunas (methods of policy). The circle 
of the twelve States gives rise to the employment of the six 
methods. Differing from Vatavyadhi ( who said that there were 
only two methods, sandhi and <vigraha) and for once agreeing 
with the acaryas.Kautilya accepts the position that there are six 
gunas and briefly defines them The Sarasvativilasa (p.«) 
quotes a sutta of Gautama about the six gunas, which is not 
found in the printed text. 25 * Kautilya defines the six as follows - - 
&mdh m means making an arrangement or agreement; vigraha 
means taking up a hostile attitude; Sscma means an attitude of 
indifference ; yam means preparing ( for attacking one's enemy } ; 
scansmya means taking shelter (with another powerful king); 
dvatdhibhava. means making peace with one king and adopting 
a hostile attitude to another He then states that a king who is 
less strong than his neighbour may make an agreement with 
him, one who is rising in power may take up a hostile attitude, 
whoever thinks ' the hostile king cannot hurt me nor can I hurt 
him' may remain indifferent ( or neutral) in his own State, one 
who is endowed with all advantages may march against the 
enemy, whoever is devoid of strength should seek the protection 
(of a powerful ruler), and one should resort to a two-fold attitude 
when one's object can be accomplished by a friend. Some other 
works give more exact definitions and also define dvaidhlbhava 
somewhat differently, via. dvaidhfthava is dividing one's army 
into two parts. Vide Visnudharmottara 301 II 150. 3-5 andMit. on 
Yaj. J. 346. Some say that sarhsraya means seeking the protec- 
tion of the udaslna or madhyama king. Kautilya ( book VH )

two sorts. Earn. IX. 2-18 and Agni 240 enumerate sixteen 
kinds of sandhis and Earn defines.them. His treatment is based 
on Kaut. V3I 3 Xaut ( V3L 3 ) says that when a weak king is 
attacked by a powerful king who is the leader m a circle of 
States, the former should at once submit and sue for peace on 
condition of offering his .army, treasury, himself and his 
territory. Then he says that sandhis made on condition of 
offering the army are of three kinds viz atm&m&a ( lit offering 
himself as the prey, which involves the condition that the king 
himself witb a fixed number of troops or with the flower of his 
army would present himself when called ), Stmaraksana ( saving 
himself, where the condition is that the commander-in-chief or 
the crown prince would present himself with an army ), adrsta- 
pui.usa ( lit in which no person is definitely prescribed, where 
the agieement is that some one on the king's behalf or the 
king himself should march with the army to some place as 
required by the invader ) These sandhis are called dcmdopanata 
(lit in which submission is made with the army) Sandhis 
made on condition of offering the treasury (koiopmala) are 
panlcraya ( lit. price, where by offering the treasury the other 
elements of lajya are kept free), upagraha (where as much 
money is offered as can be carried on a man's shoulder), topuw 
( lit broken half of a pot, where an immense amount of money 
has to be paid) Sandhis called desopanata (submission with 
offer of territory ) are adista ( where a part of the realm-is cefleo 
and the rest saved from the invader ), ucchmna ( wher ° a11 ™ 
realm except the capital which has been deprived of all u 
wealth is offered ), apahaya where by offering the produce i ol -w 
land the kingdom is freed, paribhUmna where the «jroenw»»

ment to help each other ), samlxmdhaja ( by offer of a princess in

furnished by the Lekhapaficasika which gives a form of treaty 
dated Monday, Full Moon of Vaisaktia in fxOwat 1288 (1232 A. D.) 
between Yadava king Singhana of Devagiri who is styled 
mcMrajUdlaraja and Lavanyaprasada (Lavanaprasada) a Vfighela 
king -who is styled tanaki and mah&nmndalesraia, whereby 
the high contracting parties agreed not to invade each other's 
possessions, to combine and oppose anyone else who invaded one 
of them. Vide Bom. G. Vol I part 1 p. 200 based on Bhandar- 
kar's Eeport on the search for Mss. 1882-83 pp 38-40. Kam 
IX 23-26 and Agnipur&na 240. 10-13 mention twenty kinds of 
persons with whom sandhi should not be made, Kim. ( IX, 27-41 ) 
states the reasons why it should be so and in IX, 42-52 seven 
persons are enumerated with whom he recommends sniwffu and 
gives reasons. A king should make sandhi even with one equal 
in strength { not only with one who is more powerful ), since 
victory in battle is doubtful (Earn. IX. 59) OT Kant uses a 
striking simile when he says that if one king comes in conflict 
with an equal they both will be destroyed in the same way as 
two unbaked eaithen pots striking against one another. If a 
more powerful king rejects the proposal of a weaker king for 
sandhi, the latter should take up the attitude of offering his army 
or follow the course prescribed in book XH ( a. balli)amm ) In VB. 
12 when dealing with agreements between kings, about under- 
takings to build forts or irrigational works oi forests &c. Kant 
makes very interesting remarks about land routes being superior 
to water routes and about the route to the Deccan and the 
south being more profitable than the one leading to the Hima- 
layas.^ Earn X 15 ( = Agni 240. 19 ) says that team ( hostile 
attitude) is of five kinds viz that of step-brothers, that due to 
land (seizure of or encroachment on lands or houses), due to 
woman ( carrying away one's wife or loving the same woman ) 
due to words ( cutting speech ) and due to wrongs. Kam X 2-5

( = Agni. 240. 20-24 ) enlarges upon the 16 ways in which 

vtgralta ( hostility } springs, such as seizing the kingdom, wife, 

districts, vehicles ( horses, elephants ) and wealth of another, 

pride, harassment of subjects &o. When a king feels that his 

own army Is well-nourished and pleased, that his subjects are 

prosperous and contented and that the army and subjects of 

another are the opposite of this, then he may adopt a hostile 

attitude and when he feels sure that he will Becure one of the 

three fruits of hostility ( viz. land, ally and wealth— Kara. X 

26-28 ). Kaut. VH 15 deals with the attitude and conduct of a 

conquered king who has offered to the conqueror his army 

( dandooanafa-vrlla ), while YU. 16 speaks of the conduct of the 

dantfqpawyi ( an aspiring king who wants to make by means of 

his army another king submit to him ) Tana means marching 

for invasion on the part of a vijigtsu whose army and prowess are 

of the highest and wnose subjects are contented on account of 

his good qualities ( Kara. XL 1 ) The Matsya 240 2 and the 

Agnipurana ( 228. 1-2 ) add that when the enemy in the rear is 

overwhelmed by an nkranda, then the vijiglsu should start on an 

invasion or when the enemy is plunged in calamities But 

before actually invading the enemy who is yatovya ( chosen for 

attack ) an ambassador < duta ) should be sent ( Earn. XE 1 ) to 

see whether the enemy will submit without fighting That is, 

there was to be no war without negotiations and an ultimatum 

In the Mahabharata (Udyoga83 5-7) it is said that Kw»

crowned with reward. Similarly the Alt'* Ar. HL 3. 4 men- 
tions the Bigns of approaching death, one of which is to seem 
a dream a dark person with hlack teeth. Both these passages 
are quoted by Sankara in his bhasya on Vedantasutra II 1.14. 
The Visnudharmottara II. 138-144 (based on Garga), II 164, 
Matsya 228-241, Agni 230-233 are concerned with ttie portents 
and omens in the heavens, in the sky and on the earth and rites 
(sanhs) meant to avert the evil prognostications from them. 
The M&nasollasaH. 13 pp. 97-112 and Rajanltiprakasa pp 331- 
351 also deal with these and other astrological matters, which 
are passed over here, though some of them are very interesting 
e. g. Visnudharmottara IL 135. 1 refers to the weeping and 
dancing of images. On the 6th day from the time the rites 
begin which is the day previous to the starting of the invasion 
the king undergoes a ceremonial bath for victory called jayu- 
bhiseki. This is described at great length in the Rajanltiprakasa 
pp. 351—395 quoting extansive passages from the Lingapurana. 
The ceremony of Jauasnnna, resembles the coronation ceremony 
in many raspeots. The Matsyapurana 243 15-16 and the 
Visnudharmottara IL 163. 18-J1 contain the sama long list 
(with very slight variations) of articles, persons and animals tho 
sight of which is auspicious when the king starts on an invasion 
and Matsya (343. 2-14) contains another long list of inauspicious 
sights. A few of the auspicious ones are white flowers, jars 
full of water, cows, horses, elephants, fire in flames, a courtesan, 
durva grass, gold, silver, copper, all gems, sword, umbrella, 
banner, corpse not accompanied by crying persons, fruits, the 
simhhi sign. Among the inauspicious things and sights are 
dark grains, cotton, dried cowdung, fuel, jaggery, tonsured or 
naked man or man with dishevelled hair or wearing reddish 
robas, a lunatic, a candala, a pregnant woman, broken pot, chaff, 
ashes, bone3. The Manasollasa IL 13 verses 811-833 (pp. 102- 
103), Nltimayukha pp 58-59 also give long lists of inauspicious 
and auspicious sights or events. Matsya 243. 27 and Visnu- 
dharmottara IL 163. 32 are both careful to add that all evil 
signs are counterbalanced by the confident (or joyous) frame 
of the mind, which is the highest sign of victory. 306 G-aut.

228 History of .Dharmaiastra [ Vol- 

( XI. 15-17 ) prescribes that the king should heed the advice of 
astrologers and of those who are adepts in averting the effects 
of portents and perform the rites indicated by them such as 
grahas&nti, rites on auspicious days and of svastyayana, rites of 
black magic against nis enemy &c. Eaut. IX. 7 (at the end ) 
says that the removal of divine calamities is brought about 
by the worship of deities and by honour to brahmanas and by 
performing rites prescribed in the Atharvaveda. Manu VH. 82 
and YSj. I. 315 state that gifts made to learned brahmanas are 
an inexhaustible treasure for the king The Bajadharmakands 
(p 109) quotes the Brahmapurana requiring the king to perform 
two Laksahomas every year and also a Xotihoma. The Baja- 
dharmakanda (p 113) and Rajanltiprakssa (p 144) quote 
TTdyogaparva 33. 93-95 which set out eight indications of a 
man's approaching fall, viz hating brahmanas, opposing 
brahmanas, depriving them of their wealth, desire to kill or 
harm them, taking pleasure in calumniating them, not liking 
their praise, not remembering them in religious acts and get- 
ting angry when they make requests 

It may be useful and interesting to see how in very ancient 
times the king was made ready for battle The Ssv. Gr.S, 
( TIT 12) says: when a battle is impending (the purohita) should 
make the king put on his armour (in the following way). Th« 
purohita should stand to the west of the chariot (of the king) 
muttering the hymn (Rg X 173) 'I have brought thee &c.\ 
He should hand over to the king his armour with Rg VI 75. 1 
' when the man with armour advances it is like the appearance 
of the cloud &o '. He hands over the bow with the next verse 
(Rg. VI 75. 2 ' dhanvana gS). The purohita should make the 
king recite the next verse (Rg. VL 75. 3) and should himself 
mutter the 4th verse ( Rg VL 75. 4 ) He should hand overthe 
quiver to the king with the 5th verse (Kg. VI 75. 5) When 
the chariot turns in the direction intended the purohita should 
mutter the sixth verse (Rg. VI 75 6) He should recite over 
the horses the 7th (Rg. VI 75. 7 ) He makes the king recite 
the 8th ( Rg. VI 75. 8 ) when the latter looks at the arrows and 
makes the king recite Rg. VI 75. 14 ('he ^envelopes , hfc iaxm 
&c.) when the latter fastens to his arm the leather (thatpio- 
tecte his arm against the bow-string) *hen the king tebeb* 
taken forward in the chariot by the ^arioteertiiep^ohrta 
SLdsthe chariot near the king and makes him recite the 
SZoalled Abblvarta (Rg. ^f^SS* 
VBL 101. 3-4). Then the priest looks at the long wjw

theApratiratha hymn (Rg. X 103 'asuh sisano'), the Sfcsa 
tamm (Bg. X. 152 'sasa ittha') and the Sauparna hymn 
•pradharayantu madhuno ghrtasya'. 307 Then the king should 
traverse in order all directions in his chariot. He should 
stand in that direction in which the Sun (by day) or 
Venus {by night) shines and give fight from that direction 
The king should pass his hand over the drum with the three 
verses (Rg. VL 47. 29-31 'fill with breath (or roar) the heaven 
and the earth')- The king should discharge arrows with Rg. VL 
75. 16 and the purohita should mutter Rg. VL 75. 17 ('where 
the arrows fall together &o.) when soldiers are fighting, or the 
purohita may direct or teach (the king to recite from the above 
such verses as are appropriate to his actions). 308 In the Harsa-

the four quarters, Harsa was bathed in water poured from silver 
and golden jars, performed worship of Siva, offered oblations 
into fire that sent up flames turning from left to right, made 
gifts of jars full of sesame grains and of cows whose hoofs and 
horns were tipped with gold, sat on a throne on which tiger-skm 
was spread &c 

When starting on an invasion the king was required to 
perform a rite called niraianamdhi which consisted in waving 
lights before horses, elephants, banners, araues &c. m In II 30 
Kautilya 310 prescribes that on the 9th day of As vine lights 
should be waved before horses and at the beginning and close 
of invasions and in times of diseases In II 32 Kautilya speaks 
of the waving of lights before elephants thrice in the catunnasya 
(from about July to October) and at the time when two seasons 
meet Kalidasa in the Eaghuvamsa 4-25 refers 3t *tothe per- 
formance of this ceremony when Eaghu started on his digvijaya 
and states ( in 17-13 ) that durva grass, barley sprouts and the 
bark of the palasa tree were required in the Nlravjanavidhi. 
Earn IV. 66 speaks of waving lights before horses and elephants 
(nIrS]ita-hayadvipah). The Brhatsamhita, chap. 44 (verses 
16-28 ) deals with the ceremony of waving lamps before horses, 
elephants and men. This ceremony had to be performed every 
year in the month of Asvina from the first to the 9th day of the 
bright half or on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Ktobta 
( aco. to the Brhatsamhita 44-2 ) by those who owned horses ana

Visve-Davas, Frajapati, Indra and Visnu were to be recited over

full of water, various foods were to be offered as ball, fuel 
sticks of Ichadtra and other holy trees were to be brought. The 
king seated on a tiger-skin and facing the east should sit Dear 
the fire together with an astrologer and horse doctor and should 
follow at the direction of the purohita the procedure laid down 
for Grahayajfia ( sacrifice to planets ) and the raising of Indra's 
banner. A horse and an elephant possessing the most auspici- 
ous signs should be bathed and honoured with new white cloth, 
sandal-wood paste, garlands and incense and should be brought 
to the foot of the arch near the shed with sweet words to the 
accompaniment of music and conch-blowing. The movements of 
the horse and elephant should be watched and prognostications

kinds of tribute are said to have been levied from the Mleooha 
kings by Bhlma 3 ' 2 

Kautilya devotes one book ( vTH) to the discussion of 
ujusana. Vyasana 3 ' 3 means ' what deprives a man of great good' 
( from the root 'as * to throw with ' vi * ) According to Kaut 
vyasana may be either the absence of qualities ( such as noble 
birth ) or the opposite of such qualities, faults ( such as hot 
temper ), excessive attachment ( to women &c ), harassment (by 
invasion or calamities like famines ) So vyasanas may broadly 
be divided into two classes viz calamities and faults due to 
Mma ( passion ) and kiod/ia (hot temper) The view of many 
ucaujas is that of the vy asanas of the king, ministers, the people 
of the realm, fort, treasury, army and ally, the vyasanas of eaoh 
preceding one are more serious than those of each succeeding one 
From the discussion in VJH 1 it appears that Kautilya in this 
case agrees with the acaryas Differing from Bhardvaja 
Kaut holds that the calamities befalling a king or his vices 
are more serious in their consequences than those of the 
ministers, since it is the king who appoints the ministers, the 
purohita, other servants and superintendents of departments and 
he can employ others in their places and since the rise or fall of 
the people depends upon him Disagreeing with Visalaksa 
Kautilya holds that the vyasanas of ministers have more serious 
consequences than those of the people, as all (national) under- 
takings proceed from the ministers, as the security of person 
and property from internal and external enemies, adoption of 
remedies to resist calamities, recruiting of army, collection of 
t axes are all in their hands. Differing from the Bchool o f

HI] Trouble* of iMiious lamh 233 

Parasara, Kautilya is of opinion that the vyasana of the people 
has graver consequences than that of the fort (or capital), for 
forte, treasury and army, all irrigation and agricultural work, 
stability, bravery and abundance (of things) spring from the 
people. Against Pisuna, Kautilya states that the calamities 
befalling the fort (or capital) give rise to graver consequences 
than those of the army for the reason that it is in the fort that 
the treasury and army are kept safe. Kaut. (VUL %) holds 
that internal troubles aTe more serious than external ones and 
troubles due to ministers are the most serious of all internal 
troubles. Kaut. prefers an ignorant ruler ( who has not studied 
sastras ) to a king who is bent on swerving from the dictates of 
ssstras which he knows; he prefers a king suffering from illness 
to a new king ( a conqueror ), a weak but a high-born king to a 
strong hut low-born one. InVm 3 he enumerates the several 
faults and vices which have already been Btated above ( p. 54 ). 
After remarking that ignorance and lack of training are the causes 
of vices or faults, Kaut discourses on the relative seriousness 
of the several faults or vices and holds that gambling is worse 
than hunting, that sexual passion is worse than gambling, that 
drinking is worse than sexual vice and that gambling is the 
special cause of dissension among sanghas (corporate assemblies) 
and among families of nobles that have the characteristics of 
sanghas. In VIOL 4 he states that among divine visitations like 
fire, flood, epidemics and famine, floods are more devastating than 
fire, diseases and epidemics are less destructive than famine 
that the loss of outstanding 31 * men is more serious than that of 
common men even in large numbers, since there can hardly be one 
eminent man among a thousand ordinary or inferior men He 
holds that the trouble caused by the Crown Prince is a lesser evil 
than that caused by a favourite queen In Yin. 5 Kautilya holds 
a discussion on the troubles arising from the army and allies 
He first enumerates thirty-three matters that may cause trouble 
with the army, such as not giving due respect to it, or showing 
contempt to it, not dispensing the pay at the proper time, not 
preventing diseases from attacking it, having soldiers who are 
very fond of their wives He then takes pairs of troubles out of 
these and states which is the lesser evil of the two. Then he 
deals with causes that lead to the loss or defection of allies

In the Rajadharmakanda, the Rajanltiprakasa and other 
works the king is advised to celehrate several rites and festivals! 
which may be briefly referred to here They were meant as 
propitiatory rites to avert national calamities and also to keep 
the populace in good humour and to afford enjoyment to people 
The Rajadharmakanda ( pp 115-117 ) and the Rajanltiprakasa 
( pp 416-419 ) quote about 35 verses from the Brahmapurana 
to the effect that the king is to celebrate in one or more of the 
six months from Vaisakha festivals ( devayatra ) in honour of 
various deities such as Brahms, the gods, the Ganges, Vinayaka, 
Nagas, Skandd, the JLdityas, Indra and Rudra, the MStrs ( Duiga 
and others ), the Earth, Visvakarman, Vianu, Kamadeva, Siva, 
the Moon respectively on the itthts from the 1st to the 15th 
The same two works quote a passage of 18 verses from the 
Skandapurana about the festival of moonlight and also the rite 
of raising the banner of Indra and the latter quotes (pp 425-433) 
a long passage from the Visnudharmottarapurana also Vide H 
of Dh. vol. II pp 825-26 for description of the festival of Indra's 
banner They describe the worship of Devi on the 8th and 9th 
days of Asvina ( from the Devlpurana ) when animals •were 
sacrificed, the gifts of cows on the Amavasya of Kartika,the rite 
called Vasordhara ( stream of wealth ) The details of all these

CHAPTER X 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY OF RXJADHAKtfA. 
AND THE ENDS OF THE STATE 

In the preceding pages an attempt has been made to present 
a picture of the theory and practice of Government and state- 
craft as delineated by ancient and medieval Indian writers cm 
dharmasastra and artha^stra One feature that would strike 
any reader is the religious colouring with which all theories and 
ideals are suffused. Another is that the ideal set before rulers 
and their officers is a highly moral one. Several faults have 
been found in the theory and practice inculcated by the writers. 
Except for some centuries before and after the Christian era, 
monarchy has been the only form of government known in India 
and monarchy alone is generally envisaged by Indian writers. 
The result has been that the king came in practice to be almost 
synonymouj with government and the State, though a very 
lofty sense of his duties and responsibilities was impressed on 
the king. Another defect lies in the almost total absence of 
discussion on the form and working of oligarchical or republican 
States Besides, once the main outlines of the theory of the State 
were established by the first writers on polity, for about two 
thousand years succeeding generations of authors were content 
to follow in the old grooves and hardly ever made any fresh 
approach to the problems of government or started any rival 
conceptions or theories Ancient authors were content to induce 
the kings and the people to support as far as possible the status qua. 
They thus provided for a more or less static society and did not 
encourage any dynamic thoughts or movements There was no 
strong or assertive middle class nor was there any organized 
Church. Though the brahmanas were a sacred class, they were 
not organized as a body and had to depend only on exhortations 
and texts to exert influence on the monarchs It may no doubt 
be pointed out that similar conditions prevailed almost all the 
world over. Small States, constant wars and invasions were the 
commonest phenomena in Europe till the 15th or 16th century 
and no reproach should be levelled at the Indian writers 
alone It cannot, however, be gainsaid that even after experi- 
encing the constant plundering expeditions and religious 
persecutions of Scythian, Hun and Moslem invaders from the

before all the provinces and peoples of India viz. meeting the 

£^// Bn ft? B and fanatiCal in ^«- which, ffp7o! 
perly handled, would have acted as a unifying force. It was to 
some extent only in Yijayanagara and Mah&rSstra that in 
medieval times means were adopted to weaken the power of the 
invader, to present a solid front and establish powerful Hindu 
kingdoms. The old writers spun the same old webs of theories 
tbat had been there for centuries, they did not formulate new 
theories nor did they take steps to infuse into the common 
people a sense of solidarity and unity as Indians and did not 
inculcate deep and abiding sentiments of patriotism similar to 
those we find in Western countries for the last two or three 
hundred years. In spite of such drawbacks it will have to be 
conceded that ancient Indian writers made substantial and 
independent contributions to the theory and practice of 
Government and that their handiwork can stand comparison 
with the ancient and medieval thought of most countries of 
the world. 

It may be asked : What in these days is the use of the 
study of the theory and practice of Government in ancient India? 
It may be argued that the world is now hoping, as promised by 
the great leaders of the United Nations, 'to enjoy several free- 
doms, that great expectations are created in the minds of 
millions of down-trodden peoples, and that all peoples including 
Indians will be faced in the near future with democracy and

cannot throw much light on the pressing needs of the present 
or the serious questions that will confront all in the latter half cf 
the 20th century It may be conceded that the situation in which 
we find ourselves now and in which we shall be placed in the 
near future is unique and much light cannot be thrown by a 
study of the past on the solution of the problems that will have 
to be tackled by us But that study has certain useful purposes 
to serve. Millions of people in India as Veil as in the world 
are hardly better than hewers of wood and drawers of water m 
their own countries. They intensely desire to be masters in then- 
own countries and of their own destinies. The iron has entered

At the end of this section on Bajadharma, a question may 
be asked: what were the ends or purposes that the State in 
ancient India placed before itself or the dharmasSstra and 
arthasastra writers said the State should place before itself ? 
The end of the State has been differently stated by different 
philosophers and theorists of the West from ancient times to 
the present day. To take only a few examples To Plato and 
Aristotle iK the end of the State was good life for the citizens. 
But it is not very easy to say what is meant by the good life. 
Bluntschli in "Theory of the State' (Oxford, 1885) Book Y 
Chap. IV p. 300 formulates the proper and direct end of the 
State to be ' the development of the national capacities, the 
perfection of the national life and finally its completion", 
provided, of course, that the process of moral and political 
development shall not be opposed to the destiny of humanity. 
This definition is not easy to grasp. There is no agreement as 
to what is the destiny of humanity and the concepts of nation 
and national life are hardly older than a few centuries even 
in Europe. For ' nation' one may substitute the word ' country '

316. Aristotle in ■ Politics * says ' A state exists for the sake of a good 
life and not for the sake ol life only .. Political society exists for the sake of 
noble actions and not of mere companionship' (Book III Chap. 9),

or ' kingdom '. Then it may be of some application to India It 
is impossible to define the end of the State in a single word or 
in a few words. This question about the end of the State has 
been partly answered already when speaking of the ideals of 
kingship. At the risk of some repetition a reply to the above 
question may be given in the following words The authors 
on Dharmasastra had a very low estimate of human nature, 
they believed that ordinarily men were depraved, that it was 
difficult to find a man pure by nature and that men were kept 
in the straight path by the fear of punishment ( Manu "VIL %% = 
Santi z,6 ° 15. 34) Yaj I 361 requires the king to punish anfl 
bring to the proper path castes and guilds when they swerve 
from their dharma. Kam. (IL 40 and 42-43) says the same 
thing and adds that In the absence of danda the world will 
revert to the state of matsya-nyaya ( the strong devouring the 
weak ). Sukra I 23 says the same thing The ancient writers 
did not rely on the natural moral impulses of man and on lus 
will to do the right thing. The same ideas are expressed by 
some Western writers on law and politics ' A herd of wolves 
is quieter and more at one than so many men, unless they all 
had one reason in them or have one power over them 'says 
Jeremy Taylor Salmond ( Jurisprudence p 65 ) states 'man is 
by nature a fighting animal and force is the vlhma ratto not of 
kings alone but of all mankind * We must distinguish between 
immediate or proximate ends and the ultimate end The 
ultimate end or goal of most of our philosophy was motea 
(release or liberation from the ever-recurring cycle of birtas 
and deaths and from the miseries and suffering of life J J-M 
same was the ultimate goal of rajadharma But the P^™ 
goal of the State in India was to create such conditions ana

environments as would enable all men to live in peace and 
happiness, to pursue their avocations, to follow their^ own 
customs and usages and their ' svadharma \ to enjoy without 
interference the fruits of their labour and the property acquired 
By them. The king was the divinely provided instrument to 
create the conditions of peace, order and happiness. If the 
king impartially exercises the power of dan$a over all, whether 
his own son or enemy, in proportion to their guilt, he secures 
this world and the next for himself and the people ; the king's 
scrupulous performance of his own duties leads him and his 
people to heaven The task of the State (or the king who represent- 
ed the State ) was to repress by the threat and use of force any 
violation of the rights of personal freedom and property, 
to enforce the practice of people's own traditional customs 
and usages and to take serious care of virtues and dharaia. 
These were the sentiments of Kautilya himself ( HI 1. X 316 
At the very threshold of his work he remarks ' therefore the 
king should not allow people to swerve from or fail in their 
duties (dharma); for whoever holds fast by his dharma, 
observes the rules laid down for aryas and those of castes and 
asramas ( the stages of life ) will be happy in this world and 
the next. The members of society consisting of four castes and 
having four asramas when guarded by the king with danda 
will abide by their respective paths, being devoted adherents of 
their respective duties and avocations '. 

Both Earn. L 13 and Sukra L 67 state 817 that a king 
following the path of righteousness confers upon himself and 
his subjects the group of three viz. the three purusarthas of 
dharma, artha and kama ; if he acts otherwise he certainly ruins 
(himself and the people) The same doctrine is inculcated by 
other works, such as Santi 85. 2, Markandeya 27. 29-30. !18

Therefore what the king was to do was to see that the dhamai 
of vama and asrama were observed by the people and if the; 
swerved from them to bring them back by punishments 
Sukra IV 4 39 says that each caste was to observe the rules o 
the caste handed down from generation to generation and that i 
its members behaved otherwise they were liable to be punished b; 
the king The principal works emphasize that each individua 
in the State should fulfil his own duties (svadharma) as belong- 
ing to a particular class (varna) or a particular stage of Iif< 
(asrama) or his own duties due to the position he occupies am 
those known as samanya dharma such as aktmsa, truthfulness 
&c (for which see H of Dh vol H pp 10-11 ) and that the 
purpose of the State was to enable him to do so and to prevent 
others from interfering with him All this laid undue 
emphasis on the preservation of the status quo, on current 
beliefs and practices as the ideal The writers do not emphasize 
that each individual must actively pursue the good of the 
society as a whole As the final goal was moksa, undue emphasis 
was laid on other-worldiness, on individual attainment and on 
detachment and running away from ordinary worldly affairs 
The goal of the State was deemed to be to enable men to attain 
the four pvrusm lhas, particularly the first three (as the last viz 
moksa depended only upon individual philosophical insight and 
mystical experience and was attainable only by a microscopic 
number) Even the Barhaspatya-sutra* " ( IL 43) says that the fruit 
of polity was the attainment of dharma, artha and kama Soma- 
deva begins his Mitivakyamrta in a characteristic way when he 
performs obeisance to rajija (the State) that yields the three 
fruits of dharma, artha and kama w Earn. 8 * 1 IV. 7? winds up 
his discussion of the seven elements of rajya with the declara- 
tion that the entire State depends for its highest stability on 
wealth and the army and that the State when handled by a 
sagacious minister results in securing the three goals Eautilya 
( in L 7 ) first advises people not to eBchew pleasures altogether,

but to enjoy pleasures in such a way as not to conflict with the 
requirements of dharma and axtha, and adds that a man may 
enjoy in an equal degree the three goals of life that are dependent 
on each other, since any one of the three if pursued to excess 
harms not only the other two but also itself. The Dharma- 
sastra authors held that Dharma was the supreme power in the 
State and was above the king, who was only the instrument to 
realize the goal of dharma. To these authors the State was not 
an end in itself but only a means to an end. Kautilya, true to 
his position as a writer on arthasastra, finally states his opinion 
that artha is the chief among the three goals, as the other two 
depend upon wealth for their realization. With this statement 
of Kautilya, one of the most renowned figures of Indian anti- 
quity, this section on rajadharma may be appropriately brought 
to a close. 



VYAVAHARA 

(law and ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE) 
CHAPTER XI 

1 1 

That to administer justice impartially and to punish the 
guilty were among the prime functions of the sovereign has been 
stated above (p. 57) The king was deemed to be the fountain (ie 
the distributor ) of justice Kautilya 3s (1. 19) prescribes that the 
king was to look into the disputes of citizens and country people 
in the 2nd part of the day ( divided into 'eight parte ). Manu 
( VUL 1-S ) states that the king desirous of looking into the 
disputes of people should enter ihs'sdbha {the hall of justice) 
accompanied by brShmanas, ministers and should there decide 
every day the causes of litigants. Sukra IV. 545 is the same 
as Manu VEX 1, Vas 16 2, Sankha-Likhita, Ya 3 . L 327 and IL 1, 
Visnu Dh. S. IIL 72, Nar. (I. 2 ), Sukra IV. 5-5, Manasollasa II. 
20, verse 1243 state that the administration of justice was the 
personal concern of the king. The Mit on Yaj. II 1 says that 
protecting the subjects is the highest duty of a king and that that 
duty cannot be discharged without eradicating and punishing 
the wicked, which latter requires that the king shoul d adm inister 
justice ( vyavaharadarsana ). Medhatithi on Manu VUL 1 also 
says that protection consists in the removal of troubles, secular 
and spiritual ( adrsta ). Manu VUL 13 and 14 ( «* N5r HI 8-9 
p. 42) personifies the administration of justice as Dharma 
incarnate by representing that when justice is administered the 
dart of adharma or falsehood by which dharma is pierced is 
take"n out from the body of Dharma. Yaj. ( 1 359-360 ) declares 
that the impartial administration of justice yields the same 
rewards as solemn vedic sacrifices do. In this way administra- 
tion of justice was held to be a very sacred duty. Manu V TL 
128 ( = Vrddha-Harlta VH. 194) declares that a king ww 
punishes those that do not deserve to be punished and who dcvs 
not punish those that deserve punishment incurs great oblocfuy 
and goes to hell. Vas. ( 19-40-43 ) prescribes one day's fast for 
the king and three days' fast for the purohda when the King 
lets off those that deserve punishment and three days * as * 10 * 
the king and the hrcchra penance for the purohita when the Kmg

punishes the innocent. The MahabMrata** (^usasana 6-38 
Jndohap.70, andBSmayana say that if a king intent on pleasures 
does not show himself to litigants who approach him for deci- 
sion, he would suffer like king Nrga. The Sukranlt^ra ( W. ! 5-8 ) 
also says the same thing. In the Bamayana (TO 53-54 ) king 
Nrga is said to have been cursed to become a chameleon for a 
long period by two brahmanas who had a dispute about the 
ownership of a cow and could not see the king for many days. 
Megasthenes ( Frag. XXVU. pp. 70-71 ) says * the king remains 
the whole day in court without allowing the business to be 
interrupted? Kaut 335 (119) gives the advice that, when in 
court, the king should not cause petitioners or litigants to wait 
long at the door, for when a king makes himself inaccessible, 
thoso who are near him create confusion about what should or 
should not be done, whereby the king engenders disaffection 
among his subjects and makes himself a prey to his foes. The 
king's court 326 of justice was called dharmasthana (Sankha- 
Likhita), dlwrmasana (tfarada I. 34, Manu yUL 23, Sukra 
IV. 5-46) or dhanriMhilcarana ( Katyayana and Sukra TV. 5-44 > 
' The place where the decision of the truth of the plaint { lit, 
the cause or root of dispute ) is carried on by a consideration of 
the rales of the sacred law is called the dliarmadlukarava ( the 
Hall of Justice )' — says Eatyayana Kalidasa ( Sakuntala V) and 
Bhavabbuti ( TJttararamcarita 1 ) employ the word dharmasana* 

The authors of smrtis believed that there was a golden age 
or era of perfect virtue in the dim past, when men were bent 
only on right conduct, that later ages saw the advent of sinful

promptings, ttiat therefore regulation of life by the learned and 
the king came into vogue ( compare Gaut V TTT. l ). Manu I 
81-82 ( = Santiparva 331. 23-24) stale that in the Krta age 
dharma prevailed in its perfection, there was no advent of 
adharma among men then and that in each of the three succeed- 
ing yugas dharma declined progressively by the introduction of 
theft, falsehood and deceit. The Santiparva ( 59. 13 ff ) narrates 
that in the Krta age there was no king and no punishment, that 
gradually kama (lust) and raga (passion) began to wield 
sway and dharma dwindled away. This belief in an ideal or 
perfect past was universal and was probably depicted in order 
to indv«.e men to rise higher and higher in goodness and virtue 
and to make them submit easily to the discipline of government 
and the prieBtly requirements. This ideal description of the 
past, is often found associated with the picture of anarchy that 
reigned in the dim paBt which was retrieved from horrors by 
the creation of the kingly office ( vide pp 30-34 above ). These 
diametrically opposite views of the past contained in the same 
works (such as Manu and the Mahabharata ) probably owe their 
origin to the desire of the writers to make the common people 
submit to the absolute rule of kings. Almost all works even from 
the Rgveda ( X. 10. 10 ) downwards believe in the progressive 
deterioration of religion and morals. A state of anarchy is 
visualised in a few works only for the purpose of glorifying the 
great usefulness of the institution of kingship. Mar. L 1 states 327 
' when people were solely bent on dharma and were truthful, 
there eiiBted neither administration of law and justice nor 
hatred nor jealousy. When dharma declined ( or disappeared ) 
among men, administration of law and justice came to be 
introduced and the king was declared to be the deoider of 
disputes and the chastiser ( of the guilty ) '. Br. also (S. B E. 33 
p. 277 ) Bays ' In bygone ages men were pre-eminently virtuous 
and free from cruel tendencies ; now that men are overwhelmed 
by greed and hatred, judicial procedure has to be declared '. 

The idea of Dharma took the place of the very ancient 
conception of rta. In the Rgveda rta denotes the supreme

occursten times), X.190 1. On the relation of rte . «fl .taw 
BeroMeimer in his ' The world's legal philosophy ( transla ed 
by Jastrow, New York, 1929) says: " closely connected with the 
religious and philosophical views of the Aryans are certain 
fundamental positions in regard to the philosophy of law which 
in turn became the antecedents of later legal and ethical 
developments among the Greeks and Eomans. Foremost among 
these philosophical conceptions is 'rita\ which is Tat once the 
organized principle of the universe and the divine ordering of 
earthly life; as the former it regulates the appearance of the 
sun and the moon, of day and night and embodies the un- 
changeable principle that pervades the succession of phenomena ; 
as the latter it is affiliated with purpose and human benefit 
and is exemplified in the flow of the rivers which fertilize the 
fields; in the cattle useful to men; in the institutions of 
marriage, of the monarchical state, of the patriarchal home ; 
and in man's sense of responsibility for his sins. The derivative 
conceptions of ' vrata *, ' dharma \ ' dhama \ ' svadha ' represent 
special aspects of 'rita' ; thus ' vrata' refers to any specialized 
embodied 'rita'; while 'dharma' refers specifically to the 
moral function of rewarding good and punishing evil" 
(pp. 37-38). "Vide Prof . V. M. Apte's paper or 'ftta* in the 
Bgveda (pp. 55-60 of the Silver Jubilee Volume of the Annals of 
the B. O. E. Institute ) in which, he tries to prove that rta means 
primarily ' the belt of the Zodiac '. 

The word vyavakfira is used in several senses in the sutras and 
smrfts. One meaning of vyavahara is ' transaction or dealing ' 
as in TJdyogaparva 37. 30 quoted above ( on p 207 ) or in Ap. Dh. 
S H. 7-16-17, L 6-20. 11 and 16. It also means ' a dispute, a law- 
suit* in Santi 69-28, Manu Vffl. 1., Vas. 161, Taj. IL 1., Vismi 
Dh, S. m 72, H5r. 1 1 and 2, Sukra IV. 5-5. A third sense is 
' legal capacity to enter into transactions * ( as in Gaut. X 48, 



246 History of Dharmaiastta [ Vol, 

Vas, 16*8, Sankha-Likhita (ictksed raja balanam dliananyapiapta- 

vyaoafiflrR^am &c. quoted in V. R. p. 599 ) A fourth but a rare 

sense is ' the means of deciding a matter ' ( as in Gant 33. 19 

' tasya vyavaliaro vedo dharmasastranyangani &c ). In this 

chapter the word vyavahara is taken to mean 'law-suit or 

dispute in a court ' and ' legal procedure \ This sense is very 

ancient. ■ In the Delhi-Topra Pillar Edict No. 1 of ASoka 

( Corpus 1. 1. vol. I p. 123 ) we have the word ' viyohalasamate ' 

( vyavaharasamata ) and the word ' vyavaharavidhi ' oocurs in 

Kharavela's Hathigumpha Inscription (EL vol XX p. 79 ). 

A ' voharika-maharnatta ' (vyavaharika-mahainatra, minister of 

justice ) occurs in the Mahayagga, I 40 3 and Chullavagga VI 

49). In the medieval digests, both law and procedure are 

sometimes dealt with in one book as in the Vyavahara-niraaya 

of Varadaraja and the Vyavahara-mayukha, sometimes the titleB 

of law are treated of in one work and judicial procedure in another. 

For example, Candesvara composed the Vivadaratnakara (on titles 

of law ) and Vyavahararatnakara ( on judicial prooedure ) The 

word vyavahara is restricted in some works to judicial procedure 

alone ( as in the Vyavahararnatrka of Jimutavahana and the 

Vyavaharatattva of Raghunandana ). The word owada which 

means * dispute ' is often used as a synonym for vyavahara in 

the sense of law-suit or legal procedure or both In A"p. Dh 

8. n. 11-29 5 and in Nar. L 5 vivada means ' law-suit ' In the 

Vivadacandra of Misarumisra and the VivSdatandava of 

Kamalakara both law and judicial procedure are treated of. 

Yaj. (118 and 305) appears to distinguish between vaiada 

(law-suit) and vyavahara (judicial procedure) 

The word ' vyavahara ,' is defined by several smrtis and com- 
mentators. Katysyana gives two definitions, one based on 
etymology and referring principally to procedure and the other 
giving the conventional sense having in view a dispute 
(upasarga) u is employed in the sense of ' various ','«' in *» 
sense of . ' doubt ','»»' means « removing ■ ; vyavaWa » » 
called because of its removing various doubts " (quoted by - 



HJ] Definition of Vyamhara 247 

p. 383, Par. M. EL p. 7 and Kulluka on Manu Vffl. 1 ). 3 *° This 
definition places the administration of justice on a high plane- 
The purpose -of all branches of Indian philosophy is the quest 
of Truth or Reality. The purpose of legal procedure is, according 
to Kat , the same viz. to find out the truth when there is a 
dispute. But there are some points of difference. The philosopher 
may take his own time in his search for truth ; hut justice has 
to be done as quickly as possible. Further, legal procedure has 
its own method and limitations in finding out the truth, that is, 
it depends on oral and documentary evidence, while a philoso- 
pher's quest of truth may be purely intellectual and subjective. 
Another definition is : ' When the ramifications of right conduct, 
that are together called dharma and that can he established 
with efforts (of various kinds such as truthful speech &c.), 
have been violated, the dispute (in a court between parties) 
which springs from what is sought to be proved ( suoh as a debt ), 
is said to be vyavahUra '. Harlta gives an easier definition: ' that 
is declared to be vyavaluira where the attainment of one's wealth 
(taken away by another) and the avoidance of the dharmas of 
others ( such as those of heretics ) are secured with ( the help of ) 
the means of proof (quoted by the Sm. 0. H p. 1). The Mit. 
( on Yaj El) defines vyavahaia as ' averment (about a matter) 
as related to oneself in opposition to another \ Sukra IV. 5. 4 
gives another definition. The Vyavaharamayukha gives a much

more elaborate definition (vide text p 1 and notes pp Hof 
my ed. ), 

AvyavaMrapada™ means 'the topic or subject matter of 
htigataon or dispute'. It is the same thing as ' vivadapada ■ 
which word occurs also in Kaut. (m -16 p 191 and W. 7 p 218) 
and m Nar. ( dattapradanika 1, abhyupetyasusrusa 1 ). Manu 
VUL 8 shows that ' pada ' means * stMm '. Yaj. H 5 defines it 
as' Ha person, who is set at naught by others in a manner 
that is opposed to the rules of smrti and to good usage or 
conventions, informs the king (or his judge), that is a 
vyavahSrapada*. From very ancient times eighteen vyava- 
hSrapadas have been enumerated. The underlying idea is that 
most of the disputes between men can be classified under 18 
heads. Even Manu ( VUL 8 ) was conscious of the fact that the 
enumeration of 18 vyavahSrapadas was a matter of a convenient 
arrangement and that the number 18 did not embrace all 
disputes whatever but only the largest number of disputes and 
the most important among them. Medhstithi and Kullfika 
make this position quite clear. ^ 

There is some difference about the number and floMen« 
clature of the vyavaharapadas among Manu and other writers 
of smrtis The following table will give some idea of the 
divergence as to nomenclature and the sequence in which tbey 
are treated of. All do not mention them in the same order as in 
Manu VHI. 4r-7. For example, the order in Taj iBtnadana, 
upanidhi, dayavibhaga, slrnS-vivada, svSmipalavivada, asvami- 
vikraya &o. Yaj. does not enumerate all of them in one place 
as Manu and Narada do.

250 History of Lharmaiaf.li a [Vol. 

It will be noticed that YSj omits the duties of husband and 
wife from the 18 topics of vyavahara as he had already dealt 
with them in his section on acara, adds abhyapelijaiuitusa and 
prahirnalia { miscellaneous wrongs ) and splits krayavikrayanu- 
saya into two and thus gives 20 topics Narada ( 1. 16-19 ) has 
the same 15 topics as those of Manu (in some cases under 
slightly different names ), omits svamipalavivada, steya and 
strlsangrahana, adds abhyupetyasusrusa and another topio viz 
praklrnaka and splits krayavikrayanusaya into two, viz krUamir 
saya and afcrlyusampi aduna. He includes steya unaei sahasa (sahasa 
verse 21 ) and also in what is an appendix. Brhaspati as quoted 
in the Smrti-candrika ( vyavahara p 9 ) names the 18 vyava- 
harapadas and adds praklrnaka Kautilya also adds praklrnaka 
and omits ' steya ' under his dharmasthlya section, though he 
deals with theft elsewhere ( as in IV. 8 and 11 ). It is not to be 
supposed that the 18 topics were first started by the Manusmrti. 
Gaut. XH. 1 mentions valpSrusya and damfaparusya, treats of 
some of the topics without specifying the technical names e g. 
he referB to the subjects of sangrahana ( in XII 2-3 ), of theft 
( XH. 12-13 ), of svamipalavivada ( in XH 16 ff ), of rnadaaa 
(in XH 26-33), of nidhi (in XH 39), of dayavibhaga (in XXVUD. 
Similarly the &p Dh. S speaks in scattered places of some of 
the topics of vyavahara such as murder ( l. e sahasa ) in 1 9. 24. 
of adultery in I 9. 25. 1-2 and 1. 10. 28 15-20, IL 10 26 18 ff, 
theft in I. 9-25 4-11, dayavibhaga in H 6 14, vakparusya in 
IL 10. 27 14. Vas. also mentions the word dayavibhaga [ m 
XVIL 40 ) and sets out rules about it and about means of proof 
( XVI 13-15 ), about madana ( XVI 31 ), about the twelve kinds 
of sons (XVH. 12-39). The Baud Dh S. (IL 2 8) employs 
iTord SvibhJ and gives several rules on that ^ 
Thus some at least out of the eighteen vyavaharapadas ( suohas 
vSaXa,dandaparusya, dayabhaga, steya) were distmcfly

the Court at the instance of the patties. Mam Vffl. 43 [pres- 
cribes that neither the king nor his offi m should start a 
dispute ( i. e. a legal proceeding ), nor should he sit silent upon 
(hush up) a matter which has been brought before him by 
auoLr (i. e. by a party). Gaut. XHL 27 lays down that a 
party should humbly approach a judge with his complaint. 
Ltyayana (27) states : 'The king^ should not, through influence 
or through greed of money, take upon himself the disputes of 
men, when they do not themselves want to contend (in a court) . 
Manasollasa EL 20 verse 1274 and Sukra IV. 5. 69 say the same. 
There must have always been several matters, of which nobody 
might complain and which the king might have to look into 
sito moUt. Manu after dealing with the 18 vyavaharapadas ( in 
VIE. 1 to IX. 251 ) requires the king ( in IX. 252-253 ) to make 
oftorts to destroy kantakas (thorns, harmful persons) and 
dilates upon many aspects of his activities in this respect. 
Narada relegates all matters in which the king took action 
mo motu. to a separate topic, prakiroaku, about which he says 
'under praklrnaka are comprised lawsuits depending on the 
king ( i. e. on the king's own action ) such as transgressions of 
the king's commandments and obedience to his injunctions, 
grants of towns, dissensions among the constituent elements (such 
as ministers) of the State, the duties and breaches there of among 
heretics, followers of the veda, corporations ( of merchants ) and 
gioups, dispute between father and son, neglect of prescribed 
penances, abstraction of gifts made to worthy persons, the 
wrath of hermits, sinful confusion of castes and the rules 
regarding their maintenance and ( in short ) whatever ( matter ) 
has been omitted in the preceding ( vyavaharapadas ) — these are 
treated under praklrnaka'. 331 Brhaspati defines praklrnaka in

the same way as Narada Kautilya deals with the vyarahsra- 
padasinhisDharmasthiya(III) section and in th e Kantaka- 
sodhana section ( IV ) speaks of matters that are similarly dealt 
with by officers called ptadestrs ( who correspond to coroners 
and police magistrates of modern times ), while matters falling 
under the dhaimasthlya section ( viz. the vyavaharapadas ) were 
disposed off by judges (called dlicomaslJms). Kantaka means 
in Kautilya as in Manu IX. 253 * harmful persons * The chief 
matters that fell within the purview of the kantakasodhana 
(removal or punishment of harmful persons ) officers or courts 
were : Artisans like blacksmiths and carpenters were generally 
to work in guilds and receive from people materials for working 
them up ; if they caused unreasonable delay in handing back 
finished articles, they were to receive one-fourth less than the 
proper wages and were to be fined twice the amount of wages , 
similar provisions are made for loss of wages and fines for 
weavers who do .not increase the weight of cloth ( cotton, linen, 
silk or woollen ) woven up to the usual standard : washermen 
were to wash clothes on wooden planks or smooth stones, but 
if they washed them elsewhere, they were to pay compensation 
for loss caused and a fine of 6 panas ; they were to be fined 
twelve panas for the sale, pledge or hiring out of other's 
clothes; they were also to be fined for keeping clothes with 
them beyond the time ordinarily required , for washing the 
best garments, garments of middling quality and inferior 
garments the wages were respectively one pana, ^ and \ ; trusts 
worthy persons and experts were to decide disputes about colour 
and wages; similar rules apply to tailors; goldsmiths, who

In an interesting paper contributed to the Sir Denison Ross volume^ 
papers pp 234-240 Dr. V. Ragbavao describes a work called 'Vaisyavamss- 
sudbakara" composed by Kolacala MaUinatha, the renowned commentator 
of the five classical Sanskrit Kavyas This wort is the report or decision 
given by a commission presided over by MaUinatha appointed to settle fl 
dispute (winch in these days might be called a caste question not cognisable 
by civil courts) that arose in the times of Devaraya « of Vidyanagart 
(1422-140GA D ). Vaisyas were given a license to trade in the 24 cilics 
and 108 shrines of the realm , certain subcastes lite the fcomatis claimed to 
be vaisyas and this privilege also. MaUinatha decides after a searching 
examination of authorities that the word's vaisya, vamfe, nSgara, uruja, trtiya-

working up copper, lead, brass, hell-metal, tin into vessels and 
articles; for manufacturing a counterfeit coin, for accepting it or 
passing it off to another the fine was a thousand panas ana for 
entering a counterfeit coin in the royal treasury the punishment 
was death; a physician, who undertook the medical treatment 
of a patient without informing ( government officers ) oi the 
dangerous nature of the disease, was to he punished with the 
first amercement if the patient died and with the middling fine 
if the patient died through the carelessness of the physician and 
if the patient suffered some vital injury, the matter was to he dealt 
with as assault ( dandaparusya ) ; musicians and actors shall 
stay in one place during the rainy season and shall avoid taking 
excessive gifts or indulging in excessive praise of one patron ; 
for violating this rule the fine was twelve panas The same 
rules apply to those who show dumb plays and to other mendi- 
cants, the latter receiving as many lashes as the fine imposed 
in similar cases on others. In IV. Z Kautilya prescribes fines 
against merchants that use false measures, weights and 
balances; that sell timber, iron, jewels, ropes, clothes mis- 
representing them as superior when they are inferior; that 
conspire to prevent the sale of merchandise ; that cause adultera- 
tion of grains, oik, salt, medicines &c. ; that raise the prices 
beyond those fixed by the superintendent of commerce for local 
commodities and for foreign produce. In IV". 3 Kaut. provides 
for measures against such calamities as fire, floods, pestilen- 
tial diseases, famine, rats, tigers, serpents and prescribes a fine 
of twelve panas for catching or injuring cats and mongooses 
employed to destroy rats. In IV. 4 Kaut. prescribes the measures 
that the officer called samahartr has to take to protect 'the 
subjects against those who prey upon the people secretly by 
employing foul means. He has to employ spies under various 
disguises to find out the honesty or corruption of officers in 
the villages, of superintendents, of judges, of magistrates 
and witnesses and the punishment in these cases is generally

men inclined to robbery and adultery by the employment of spies 
and agents j» ouocatems in the guise of ascetics and persons reput- 
ed to possess miraculous powers The Kautiliya IV 6 and 7 respec- 
tively describe the seizure of criminals on suspicion or in the 
very act itself and examination in cases of sudden death Kaut 
IV. 8 speaks of questioning in the presence of the wronged 
party of the witnesses of the accused, whether they are his 
relatives or total strangers, as regards the country, the caste, 
the family, the name, occupation, property, friends and 
residence of the accused and of the application of torture to the 
accused to elicit an admission of guilt It is said that torture 
is to be applied only in the case of those whose guilt is believed 
to be established prima facie (apladosam karma karayet), that 
toiture is not to be employed when the accused is guilty of a 
minor offence, is under age, old or diseased, is under the 
influence of intoxicants, or is a lunatic, or is overwhelmed by 
hunger or thirst or fatigue due to a journey, or has eaten to 
excess or is suffering from indigestion or is weak, nor is it to be 
employed in the case of a pregnant woman or a woman who 
was delivered of a child within a month ; and in the case of 
other women only half the torture prescribed for males or only 
the asking of questions is to be employed. Learned brahmanas 
and ascetics ( when accused ) are to be subjected to espionage 
only. Those who violate these rules or incite others to do so 
and those who are guilty of causing the death of an accused by 
torture are to be punished with the highest amercement. Four 
kinds of torture were employed in the case of complaints about 
wrongs viz. six dandas, seven whippings, two kinds of suspen- 
sion, and ( fourthly ) water-tube ( i e injecting salt water in the 
nose from a tube ) » In this chapter Kaut states that one who

not a thief may for fear of torture admit that he is a thief, as 
Mandavya did. Kaut in IV. 9 prescribes that the satnaharlr 
and ptadestrs should exercise control over all superintendents 
of the various State departments and their subordinates, that 
those who steal or seize valuable articles or jewels from Stato 
mines or manufactories should be simply sentenced to death,

ments for releasing persons jailed or for rape on a woman in a 
lock-up Kaut. IV. 10 prescribes alternative punishments of fines 
in lieu of the cutting off of fingers or mutilation of limbs for 
several offences such as theft or assault, abuse and defamation 
or showing contempt to the king by riding his horse or other 
conveyance or fabricating royal orders, prescribes death for 
selling human flesh, simple death or highest amercement for 
stealing images of gods or animals, for abducting human beings 
or for wrongfully seizing fields, houses, gold, gold coins, jewels 
and crops. Death with or without torture is provided for in 
Kaut. IV. 11 for murdering a man in a quarrel (but when the 
wounded man dies a fortnight or a month after the quarrel, 
highest fine or fine of five hundred panas and the expenses of 
medical treatment); diflerent kinds of punishments are provided 
for wounding with a weapon, impalement for causing violent 
death of men and women, burning alive for those who aim at 
securing the kingdom or force entrance into the royal harem 
or incite wild tribes or enemies or instigate disaffection in the 
capital or country or army, drowning ( or solitary confinement 
in a dark room, ace. to another reading) for a brahmana 
offender of this sort, cutting of tongue for insulting or abuse of 
parents or a teacher or an ascetic, drowning for one destroying 
the dam of a tank or for a poisoner or for a woman murdering 
a man, tearing to death by bulls for a woman who murders her 
husband or child or her elders or administers poison or gets fire 
Kaut adds that the punishment of death with torture has been 
prescribed by ancient smrti-writers, but that it is proper to order 
simple death in cases of offences in which no cruelty enters. 
Kaut. IV 12 starts by declaring that no man shall have sexual 
intercourse with a woman (not his wife) against her will, 
prescribes different punishments for forcible sexual intercourse 
with an immature girl or a girl that has attained maturi^, of 

the same caste, or of a different caste, P*™ de * that for ,™t 
course with a willing maiden the fine will be 54 panas for the 
man and 27 for the maiden, further provides that it is no 
offence f o* a man of the same caste to have intercourse , wito _ a 
maiden who has not been got married for ^.£™«££.

but if he does not condone, the nose and ears of the woman 
may he out off and the paramour should he sentenced to death. 
Kaut. IV. 13 provides punishment foT brahmanas eating or 
drinking -what is forhidden to them and varying fines for 
administering forbidden food or drink to members of the four 
varnas, provides fines for house-trespass and lurking house-tres- 
pass by night, provides punishments for witchcraft, provides 
burning alive in a vessel for adultery with the queen and other 
punishments' for adultery with women of the several castes, 
whether guarded or unguarded, prescribes a fine of 24 panas for 
adultery with a nun 

The above is a meagre summary of Kautilya's section on 
kantakasodhana. Kautilya is encyclopaedic on this subject as on 
several others. The number of offences dealt with by him is very 
large and his treatment in some respects compares favourably 
with such modern criminal codes as the Indian Penal Code. 
Many of the provisions contained in Kaut. IV are found in Yaj. 
(3L 273-304), in Narada (in pTaklrnaka and elsewhere) and 
also in Manu (e g. vUL 365-368 about rape or adultery, 
Vm. 396-97 about washermen and weavers, IX. 225-226 about 
musicians and dancers, IX. 231-232, IX. 261-267 ). Why Kaut. 
treats of several offences under kantakasodhana and not under the 
oharmasthiya section, it is somewhat difficulttosay.lt is probable 
that he mcluded under dharmasthlya only those complaints or 
actions that were fought out between the parties, even though 
many f the wrongs complained of under vakparusya, danda- 
parusya, sangrahana and steya were criminal and the same 
as those faeatedof in the section on kantakasodhana In wrongs 
dealt within the kantakasodhana section it was the king or king's 
officers who themselves brought up the offenders for punishment 
and the offences were viewed not as mere private matters, but 
as matters m which the State was concerned for the eradication

guilty of a grave sin), wrongful confinement of a person &c. 
Kautilya does not apparently include ,-under praklrnaka all 
matters in which the king acts suo motu as Nar , Br. and Kat 
do hut includes these latter under kantakasodhana. He, how- 
ever, states here and there ( IV. 1 and 13 ) that the matters dealt 
with under kantakasodhana are quite analogous to those under 
such titles as dandaparusya treated of under the dharmasthlya 
section. For example, in IV. 1. he says that if a physician 
through negligence causes loss of a vital part to a patient then 
the matter may he treated as dandaparusya. 333 So Kautflya 
prohahly represents a much earlier stage of judicial administra- 
tion than Nar. or Br , wh6 included under praklrnaka all 
matters in which- the king acted of his own motion { i. e all that 
falls under kantakasodhana in Kaut ) 

The enumeration of vyavaharapadas is very ancient and 
authoritative, but there is hardly any scientific principle of 
classification underlying them. A writer called Nihandha- 
nakara quoted in the Sarasvativilasa 351 (p. 51) holds that in 
all the vyavaharapadas from mSdarta to dcajavtbliSga the relief 
claimed is something to be given or rendered (daja) by one 
party to the other, while in vakparusya, dandaparusya, sShasa, 
gambling and betting the principal relief is in the form of 
danda (punishment). Here there is a glimmering of the dis- 
tinction between civil and criminal litigation. Two deep-seated 
principles in the administration of law and justice everywhere 
are ' fulfil your promises ' and ' cause injury (himsa) to no one . 
It is therefore that we find Brhaspati stating that lawsuits aw 
of two kinds according as they originate in (demands about 
wealth or in injuries Yaj H 23 speaks of .«*««*^2 
dispute) and so made a distinction between civil and emn nal 
disputes La wsuits** originating in wealth are divid edjgj° 

q$fr* Up, 13. 



HI] Cunl and criminal actions 259 

fourteen sorts and those originating in injuries are of four sorts 
These last are vakp&rusya (defamation and abuse), dandaparusya 
(assault and battery), sahasa (murder and other forms of violence) 
and strlsangraha (adultery). Here there is a clear distinction 
made between civil disputes (aifhamula or dhanamZla) and 
criminal ones ( hunsu-mvla ) Kat. also says that disputes have 
their source in two viz. not rendering what should be given and 
injury (himsa). Though in this way a distinction was made 
between civil and criminal disputes among the 18 titles of law, 
it appears that the set of rules and the procedure in both were the 
same (except as to the time allowed for reply, as to the qualifica- 
tions of witnesses and as to proxies ), the same courts tried both 
kinds of disputes aud not as in modern times (when civil 
disputes are tried in one class of courts and criminal complaints 
in another and when the procedure also in both differs a great 
deal ) There were not two sets of courts in ancient India as 
there were in England before the fusion of Law and Equity, 
but all courts in ancient and medieval India were required to 
administer the law of the texts tempered by common sense and 
reason as laid down by Br.: 'a decision should not be given by 
merely relying on the text of the sastra; when consideration of 
a matter is divorced from reason and common sense loss of 
dharma results' (q by Apararka p. 599).

m Dharma and tho other three are really the four feet of 
nirnaya (final decision), which is one of the four stages of a 
law-suit (vyavahara) and so only in a secondary or far-fetched 
sense they are the four padas of vyavahara Each of these four 
is said to be of two kinds. Vide Sm C. H. pp 10-11, Par. M m 
pp. 198-199, V. P. pp. 87-88 where'the verses of Br are set out 
and fully explained A decision is said to be arrived at according 
to dharma when the wrong-doer admits his guilt or wrong-doing 
and the real owner secures his wealth or the relief due to him 
without having to undergo the trouble of a protracted trial by 
means of witnesses, documents &c Similarly a decision to be 
arrived at by ordeals is said to be one by dharma Dharma' and 
satya are often identified (vide note 125 above) ana here the 
wrong-doer tells the truth and the decision is therefore said to be 
by d/wti ma. When a litigation is fought out in Court by citing 
witnesses, the decision is said to be by vyavahara ' Witnesses ' 
are mentioned only by way of illustration (and imply docu- 
ments, possession and other means of proof) When a defendant 
is guilty of not giving a straight reply or when his reply is 
tainted with faults and so is unacceptable and a decision is 
given againBt him on that ground alone it is still a decision by 
vyavahara Carilia means 'the usages of a country, village or 
family ' ( deiastfutih purvakrta cantiam sanmdahrtam — Vyasa q. 
in Sm CEp 11 and Vy Nir p 138 ) This seems to be the 
seriBe of ' caritra ' in ' phalakavare oharitratoti ' occurring in 
Nasik Inscription No 12 in E L vol VJU p 82. In praklrnaka 24 
Nar Beems ,to give the same sense ' sthityartham prthivlpslais- 
caritravisayah krtah '. Contra also means ' anumana ' (posses- 
sion and presumptions). 'Anumanena nirnltam caritranuti 
kathyate '-says Br. quoted in Vy Nirnaya p. 139^and Par. M. HI 
p. 198. Usages are the means of decision in certain cases apart 
from the question whether they are supported by the smrtis or 

337. Pratyakaltta means, ace. to Apararka p 616, the deliberation of 
the judge and sabhyas as to where the burden of proof (onus proband*) lies 
and as to the method of proof. Ace. to the'Mit onYaj'Il 8, pratyikama 
in this sense is not a vyavaharapada. since it is nor directly related to tie 
litigants. Ace to Nar. IE 21 praly»ahta seems to mean an add,el °"^*!

not. 'Caritram pustakaraue ' means that such usages are 
valid means of decision if they have been written down or 
recorded by the king, while ' caritram to svIkaTane ' { the 
reading in Par. M ) means ' usages become the rule of decision 
when they are accepted as valid by the people and by the 
courts '. When a king issues 1 in a matter of dispute an order 
which is not opposed to smrtis or local usages and which is 
thought out as the most appropriate one by the king's intellect 
or which is issued to decide a matter when the authorities on 
eaoh of two sides are equally strong, it is a decision by royal 
command Br ( in Par. M in p. 148 ) and Kat ( verses 35-38 
q in 8m C H p. 10, Par. M. IH pp. 16-17, V P p 7 ) explain 
the above four. Brhaspati gives two meanings of caritra: (1) what 
is decided by inference ; (%) the usages of a country When it is 
said that each later one of the four stultifies each preceding one, 
the idea is not that in all cases it is so, but that it is so only in 
some cases. Vide Kat. ( 43 q by V. P. p 90 ) which makes this 
clear. Some examples may be given If one litigant says that 
he would prove his case by an ordeal, while the other says that 
he will prove his contention by human means ( documents or 
witnesses &c. ), then the trial by ordeal is not to be resorted to 
but the hearing ot the case is to proceed in the ordinary way 
Vide K5t 218 (q. by Mit. on Y&j. H. %Z) for this rule. Here 
dharma is set aside in favour of vyavaMra. Another example 
is given in the Par M.HL p. 18. A person belonging to one 
of the four varnas commits a seditious act (rajadroJuz) and 
through timidity admits his guilt (this is satya), but the 
witnesses ( relying on Manu X. 130 that where the punishment 
would be death a mtness may tell a lie) deny that he was 
guilty of the act and he is let off. Here dharma is set aside in 

K 77? 5ta ; w 1 bas6<i ° U the anions of witnesses). 
Vide Sm C (H.p.ll) for another similar example. In the 

country of Kerala visiting a'prostitute was not condemned by

king the usual fine for a defeated party and also the sum staked 
by him and will deliver to the successful party what is due to

the complaints of private persons of certain matters called apa- 
icidhas, padas and chalas and these works set out the lists of ten 
aparadhaa, 22 padas and 50 chafes*®. The king may himself 
come to know about these or these matters may be brought to 
his notice by an officer called sucaka or a private man called 
stdbhaka, defined ace to Kat. ( 33-34 ) as follows* — m that man 
is declared to be sucaka who is appointed by the king himself 
for finding out the wrong-doings of people and who on coming 
to know of them conveys them to the king; that man is a 
slvbhaka who with a sole eye to money and without being urged 
by the king informs the king first of actions (among the people) 
that are condemned by the sastras ' Therefore a stobhaka is 
a private informant for money The ten aparadhaa, ace. to 
Nar, are • disobedience of the king's order, murder of a woman, 
confusion of varnas, adultery, theft, pregnancy from" one not 
the husband, abuse and defamation, obscenity, assault (danda- 
parusya), abortion 341 They were called aparadhas because they 
were met with fine It will be noticed that some of these come 
under several vyavaharapadas and some like 'varnasankara* 
are included in praklrnaka by Narada (v 4) The king could 
by his own action investigate these even if no private complaint 
be lodged. Samvarta (quoted by the Sm H p 28, Par M 
III. pp 44-45) gives another list which differs in some respects 
from the above. In the Nalanda copperplate of Devapaladeva 
(E Lvol XVIIp 310, p 321) an officer called ' dasaparadhika 
is mentioned In many grants from the 7th century onwards 
among the taxes remitted to the donees we often meet the ex- 
pression ' together with the ten apaTadhas' (sadaSaparadhah , m

'sadandadasaparadhah * (B. L vol. HI p. 53 at p. 56, Torkhede 
plate of Govinda in fcake 735, and E. L vol. Ill p. 263, 266, the 
Rajor inscription of Mathanadeva dated Yikrama sarhvat 1016 ). 
It is not correct to hold that the words refer to the right of the 
donee to be exempt from guilt arising from the commission of 
some traditional offences or that authority was conferred by the 
grant on the donee to deal with offenders committing the ten 
aparadhas and to recover the fineB imposed by themselves (as 
(suggested in J B O R S for 1916 p. 53n). No king would ever 
think of exempting donees in pious gifts or the villages in those 
grants from the results of such grave aparadhas as the murder 
of a woman, adultery, theft and abortion, nor is it possible to 
hold that a king authorised a private individual or individuals 
to exercise judicial power in such crimes as murder when (as 
we shall see later on) the power of dealing with sahasa was not 
conferred on sreni or gana tribunals. The real meaning appears 
to be that the fines levied by him for the commission of the 
aparadhas in the villages granted would be made over to the 
donees as part of the gift, when recovered by the king. The 22 
vadas were called padas of the king to distinguish them from the 
vyavaharapadas. According to Pitamaba 342 they are: ripping 
open an animal's body (with a sharp weapon), destruction of 
growing crops, incendiarism, rape of a maiden, concealment of 
treasure trove, making a breach in an embankment or thorny 
hedge, grazing cattle over the field of another, destruction of 
a public garden, poisoning, high treason, unauthorised break- 
ing of the royal seal, divulging the secret line of policy of 
the king releasing from jail a prieoner, appropriation of the 
taxes or fines to be levied by the king (these are two) 
appropriating gifts (made by the king) or the utseka

Ancient systems cannot be expected to present such a classifica-

divide tile vyavaharapadas into civil and criminal They more 
or less deal with most of the subjects brought out in modem 
classifications but not in an orderly manner They also divide 
laws into substantive and adjective or procedural The vyava- 
harapadas correspond to the former and the rules about 
procedure, the appointment of Judges and the constitution of 
courts, evidence and limitation are adjective law. Some of 
these are dealt with in the commentaries and digests under a 
section called vyavaharamatrka ( the elements of judicial proce- 
dure ) and tbe rules of evidence are stated in Yaj , Jfar. and 
others under the vyavaharapada rnadana once alone It would 
be more convenient to deal with adjective law first That law 
is now of antiquarian or academic interest only and will there- 
fore be treated somewhat briefly- The smrtis lay down a high 
level of judicial procedure, but the procedure must have been 
modified to suit the requirements of different times and the 
resources and inclinations of different kings. Some of the 
vyavaharapadas viz ryadana ( recovery of debt ), strtpumsayoga 
and daydbhaga ( partition of heritage ) are of great practical 
importance even now, as all Hindus are governed in matters of 
partition, inheritance, debts, marriage and sonship by the rules 
of Hindu Law gathered from the Smrtis and digests as modified 
by legislative enactments and judicial decisions For descrip- 
tion of Judicial administration in the Buddhist texts and times,

a king who examines disputes in the presence of the Judge, the 
ministers, learned brahmanas, the purohita and the sahhyas 
attains heaven. Vide Sukra IV. 5. 5 to the same effect (taking 
half verses from Yaj. and Kat.). The king was not to decide 
by himself but was to follow the advice of his judge, though 
the responsibility even when he took advice was the king's. 
Vide Sukra IV. 5.6 (naikah paiyecca karyam). Nar. I. 35 says 
that the king has to abide by the view of the judge {pradmva- 
hamate sthttah). This sentiment that it is not safe for a single 
man, however clever he may be, to undertake to decide a dispute 
was so ingrained among all people that Kalidasa gives expres- 
sion to it in the Malavikagnimitra (Act I) when he pens the 
sentence ' sarvajnasyapyekakino nirnayabhyupagamo dosaya'. 
In Kaghuvarhsa 17.39, Kalidasa states that king Atithi always 
looked into the causes of people himself with the help of judges 
(dharmastha)** . Pitamaha 345 states that a person even if he 
knows the rules (of dharma) should not give a decision single- 
handed. Justice was to be dispensed openly in the court and 
not secretly. Sukra (IV. 5. 6-7 ) states 346 that neither the king 
nor the judge nor the sahhyas were to hear a cause in secret and 
that there were five reasons that led to the charge of partiality 
in judges viz. hot temper, greed, threats, enmity and hearing 
disputes in private. Judicial "action is divisible into two pro- 
vinces, viz. that of law and that of fact. The latter is a field in 
which it is impossible to lay down rules for determination. On 
points of facts there was a vast scope for the king's or judge's 
discretion. And therefore the texts contented themselves by 
saying that the king or judge should keep an open or impartial 
mind, should be free from hot temper or greed, should hear 
causes under the glare of public view and should not decide 
at his own will alone but with the help of learned brahmanas 
and sahhyas. As regards points of law the king or judge is

required to decide according to the rules of dharmasastra (Manu 
VUL 3 , Yaj IL 1, Nar. I 37, Sukra IV. 5. 11) and where there 
are no texts the king should decide in accordance with the re- 
cognized custom of the country. Eat solemnly warns 347 the 
king against legislating or deciding according to his own will 
in the face of the texts : 'Ha king decides ( a case ) hy his own 
fiat where there is a text (of the sastra applicable to it) it leads 
him away from heaven, it causes ruin to the people, it brings 
danger (to the king) from the armies of his foes and it strikes 
down the roots of (long) life; therefore a king should decide 
the causes of people according to the rules of sastra ; but in the 
absence of smrti texts he should carry out ( judicial adminis- 
tration) according to the usages ( lit the views) of the country'. 
These are the same as Sukra (V. 5. 10-11). Kat further pres- 
cribes that the usages established in a country by the approval 
of its people and that are not in direct conflict with Veda and 
Smrtis should be recorded in writing under the seal of the king 
Pitamaha 348 quoted by the Sin. C. (E p. 26) states that in 
certain cases it is the king's own mind that is the deciding 
factor. 

How the king directly dispensed justice is illustrated by 
the rules of Gaut. XH 40-42 and Manu VHJ, 314-316 that a 
thief who has stolen a brahmana's gold may run with dishevelled 
hair to the king carrying an iron club or a heavy bludgeon of 
khadira wood, may declare the sin committed by him and request 
the king to award punishment, that the king may then strike 
him with the club and that whether the thief dies or lives after 
the king so strikes him he becomes free from the guilt. The 
king was also the highest court of appeal. The Eajatarangmi 
( VL 14-41 ) states how king Yasaskara heard the appeal of a

from a long absence abroadfound the well usurped by the vendee 
and was defeated in the lower courts because the vendee had bribed 
the scribe to write ' kupasahita * instead of ' ffipmahita ' and how 
the king decided in the man'sfavour by exposing the vendee with 
a trick;, while in VL 42-69 the same king is said to have reversed 
another decision about a contract by a man whose 100 coins 
had fallen into a well. The same work in another place 
(IV. 82-108) states how a brahmana wife appealed to the king 
of Kashmir to find out the culprit who had murdered her husband 
in his sleep and how the king by superhuman means held a 
sorcerer to be the murderer. 

When owing to pressure of other weighty business the 
king cannot attend to the work of administering justice, the 
king should appoint a learned brahmana together with three 
sabhyas to decide the disputes of people. Vide Manu VJ1L 9-10, 
Yaj. II. 3, Kat. 63 3W (same as gukra IV. 5. 12). The qualifica- 
tions of a judge are set out in many places. JLp. 350 Dh. S. IL 11« 
29. 5 prescribes that in law-suits judges shall be endowed with 
learning, goud family, and should be old, clever, andcareful about 
dharma. Nar. requires: ' The Judge should be proficient in the 
texts on the eighteen titleB of law, their 8000 Bub-heads, in logic 
( anviksiki ) and should be master of the Veda and Smrtis. Just 
as a physician takes out from the body an iron dart by the employ- 
ment of surgical instruments, so a judge should extricate from a 
law-suit the deceit ( underlying it ) \ 3S1 Kat says that a judge 
should be restrained, born of a good family, impartial, not 
repellent (or harsh in his manners), steady, afraid of the next 
world, highly religious, assiduous and free from hot temper. A. 
fine enumeration of the qualities required in a judge is given 
in the ancient drama Mrcchakatika ( IX. 4 ). Vide Manasollasa

IL 2 verses" 93-94. A Judge was generally styled prSdrivafoi or 
sometimes dhccrmadliydksa ( as in Raj B p. 18 ), S2 or dliarma- 
pravaklr ( Manu VEX 20 ) or dharniadhiMnn (as in Manasgllasa 
H 2. verse 93 ). Pradvivaka is an ancient word. It occurs in 
Gaut XDL 26, 27 and 31, Mr. 3 * (I 35), Brhaspati(q.by 
Apararka p. 602 ). The word is a combination of \pr5d" {one 
who puts questions to the suitors, frpm the root ' pracch ' ) and 
' vivaka ' ( who speaks out or analyses the truth, from the root 
* vac ' with ' vi " ). The derivation is given by NSr , Brhaspati, 
Kat. 68 and others. The word ' prasnavivaka ' ( which is quite 
close to pradvivaka in sense and etymology ) goes very far into 
antiquity and occurs in Vaj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai. Br HE. 5 6. 
The existence of the word pradvivaka as early as Gautama 
( about 500 B.C. ) and of praSnavivSka in the Vaj. S and Tai 
Br. clearly establishes that in ancient India judicial functions 
became separated very early from executive or political 
functions. 

The chief Judge was preferably to be a learned brahmana 
(Manu VDX 9, Yaj. 3L 3). Kat. (M) 35 * and Sukra JV. 5. W 
prescribe that, if a learned brahmana cannot be had for the post 
of the chief judge, then a ksatriya or a vaisya who knows the

1H] Who tms to be a judge 273 

dharmasastaas may be appointed, but the king should carefully 
avoid appointing a sudra as a judge. Manu VHI. 20 sayB that 
the king may prefer a brahmana who is not learned and main- 
tains himself by the mere fact of his caste, but should never 
have a sudra as the expounder of dhartna and that the country 
whose king has a sudra as judge to expound dharma comes to 
ruin as a cow sinks in mud. Vyasa ( q. in S. V. p. 65 ) is to the 
same effect. Manu ( VEI 10-11 ), Yaj. ( IT. 3;), Nar. ( DL 4 ) and 
Sukra IV. 5. 17 state that the king should appoint at least three 
sabhyas {puisne judges or members of the court of justice ) to 
associate with the Chief Judge in the disposal of suits (the 
idea being that three are the least number of sabhyas to be 
appointed). Kaut. (ELI) prescribes that the courts called 
' dharmasthiya' should be manned by three judges called 
dftarawst/ias who should possess the qualifications and status of 
amatyas and that such courts should be established on the borders 
of the provinces, for a group of ten villages ( sartoraham ), for a 
district {drommuMia, 400 villages) and provinces (stiiSnhja, 
800 villages). Brhaspati says 355 that the sabhyas may be 
seven, five or three. As in the case of the chief judge, the 
sabhyas should be preferably brahmanas, but they may be 
fcsatriyas or vaisyas. Manu ( VEL 11 ) and Br. eay that when 
in a sabha three brahmanas learned in the Vedas sit along with 
the chief judge appointed by the king that is like the saiha of 
Brahma or it is like a sacrifice. Yaj E.2, Visnudharmasutra 
EI. 74, Est. 57, Nto. EL 4-5, Sukra IV. 5. 16-17 and others 
require the following qualifications in the sabhyas : they should 
be endowed with the study of the Vedas, should know dharma- 
ssstra, should speak the truth, should be impartial to friend or 
foe, should besteady, devoted to their work, intelligent, here- 
ditary, proficient^ in arthasastra. Impartiality in the king 
and the Judges k insisted on in the texts. Vide Vas. 16 AS 
Nar. (I 34.EL5) The king was not to appoint as sabhyas 
those who were ignorant of the usages of the country, who were 
atheists and devoid of the study of sastras, who were eXer 
puffed up, hot-tempered, greedy or distressed (Br.q.in Sm. C.

374 History of DhcamasMra 



[Vol. 



TL p. 15). The chief justice (prSdvivaka) with the sabhyas 
constituted the Court, being appointed {rayvMa) by the king 
It was stated above that the king was to enter the Hall of 
Justice with the chief justice, sabhyas and brahmanas. The 
distinction is that sabhyas were appointed by the king as 
judges, while brahmanas were persons who were well-versed in 
dharmasastra, who could attend the Court, though not appointed 
(amyukta) and whose opinions on difficult points of law were 
respectfully received by the judges. They (the learned 
brahmanas) were in the position of armcus cunm. All and 
sundry were not to intermeddle in trials before the court, but 
only those who were learned in dharmasastra were allowed to 
express their opinions on knotty points. Vide 357 Mifc on Yaj. 
II. 2. Manu VHL 12-14 ( same as Nar. HL 8-10 in a different 
order ) say that either a person should not enter a so&AS or if he 
enters should say what is proper, that a man remaining silent 
or declaring what is false becomes a sinner and that, where in 
spite of the opinion of some or all sabhyas, justice is not done 
by the king, they become participators in the king's guilt. Eat. 
(74-78) makes it the duty of the sabhyas to bring round a 
king gradually to the right path when the king is about to 
start on the path of injustice and to state the true decision. 358 
In the case of the brahmanas their duty ends with stating the 
rule according to the sSstras ; they have not, like the Babhyas, 
to prevent the king from doing the wrong thing or to bring 
him round to the path of right and justice. Nar, (HI 1) Bfcates 
elsewhere that one who is not appointed by the king should not 
interfere by his speech in the decision of a case and that if he 
does so he would be fined. This applies to the people that are 
present in the court to see the trial or that accompany the 
litigants. It has no application to learned brahmanas, who 
though not appointed by the king, can state their view of the 
law. 359 Vide Vyavaharasara pp. 16-17. Nar. EL 17 requires that 
all the judges of the Court should give a unanimous decision, 
and that then only the decision leaves no grievance (in the

mind of the litigants J. 360 TheV. P. (p. 27) states, following 
Jaimini XH 2. 22, that the opinion of the majority of sabhyas 
is to prevail. 361 According to Gaut. 362 XL 25 as interpreted by 
Apararka p. 599, if there is a difference of opinion among the 
judges, the king is to seek the advice of those who are learned 
in the three Vedas ( along with the other vidyas ) and decide the 
matter finally. Kat. (58-59) states that the court of justice 
should have associated with the task of deciding disputes some 
merchants who belong to a guild, who are men of good family 
and character, of mature age, endowed with wealth and decent 
conduct and free from malice. TheMit. and Sm. C, say that 
this is done to placate the common people in the country. 363 
This also shows the growing importance of the moneyed classes 
and of traders In the Mrcchakatika a sresthin and a kayastha 
are associated with the Judge 

The chief judge and the sabhyas 354 were not to hold conver- 
sation in private with any one of the litigants while the suit 
was pending and if they did so they were liable to be fined ( Kat. 
70). Xaut IV. 9 prescribes fines and even corporal punishments 
for judges (dftai maslhas) and pradestrs who corruptly give 
wrong decisions, cause loss or sentence to corporal punishment. 
If the sabhyas 355 give a decision, which is opposed to smrti and 
usage, through friendship, greed or fear, each was liable to be 
fined twice as much as the fine to he paid by the defeated party 
(Yaj.IL 4, Nar. L 67, Kat. 79-80). The Visnu Dh. S V 180 
and Br prescribe banishment and fo rfeiture of all property for

276 Aslortj of Dhcumasaslm [Vol. 

sabhyas that give an unjust decision or take bribes Est 81 
prescribes that the loss caused by the fault of sabhyas must be 
made good by them to the losing party, but the decision given 
by them will stand 366 Sukra (IV. 5 63-64) prescribes the punish- 
ment of a thief for a lehftaha (a scribe) taking down a different 
deposition from the one actually given or for a sabhya making 
use of such a deposition knowingly, IV 5 93 prescribes fine and 
removal from office if a sabhya gives a wrong decision through 
greed &c. and IV. 5. 282 prescribes a fine of 1000 panas against 
a judge giving a corrupt decision. There must have been a few 
cases of judges taking bribes in ancient India as in modern 
times ( even Lord Bacon in the 17th century was found guilty 
of taking bribes as Lord Chancellor and confessed his guilt) 
In the Dasakumaracarita 367 (VUL p 131) the cynical jester 
Vmarabhadra says to his king that judges decide matters just as 
they please after taking bribes and the king thereby incurs in- 
famy and the sin of doing injustice It was believed that when 
a just decision was given, the king and the sabhyas became 
free from sin, the sin reaches him only who is guilty (whether 
plaintiff or defendant); but where an unjust decision is rendered 
a quarter of the sin falls on the litigant (plaintiff or defendant) 
who is guilty of adhaima, one quarter each on the witnesses, the 
sabhyas and the king The Baud Dh S 110 30-31, Manu VUL 
18-19 Nai (HE 12-13) have the same two verses. TheYyava- 
haratattva(p 200) says that Harlta also had the same verses 
In the Mattavilasa-piahasana (pp. 23-24) reference is made to 
the giving of bribes to the presiding officers of courts (we should 
read ' adlnkaram-k<zranikmam ' instead of '-karumkanam). 
Kaut IV 4 makes it a duty of the samahailr to employ spies in 
various disgmses to test the honesty of judges (dharmasthas) 
iSmagistSes (pradestrs) and, if they were found to be ready 
to succumb to bribes, to order their banishment

-J, Different courts of justice 

A court of justice was (ace. to Br.») of four kinds vfa. 

Z&£ (not ted in one place, but moving to place to 
See a on a circuit), mudrM (the court of a judge appom ted 
£ Sing, who is authorised to use the royal seal), sosta (or 
JsS ace toS.V p. 68 and Par. M. IE. P. 34) 1 e the court 
S Sfch the king himself presides The Court of justice in the 
capital) was to he to the east of the palace as stated by 
Sankha and Br. (in Sm. 0. Up. 19) and was to face the 
east The court-house should be decorated** with flowers, 
statues, paintings, idols of gods and should be furnished with 
incense, throne or seat (for the king or judge), seeds, fire and 
water (Br. in Sm G. H. p. 19 ). The sabha was also called as 
stated above, dharmadhikarana or simply adhikarana (in 
Mrcchakatika IX and the Kadambari, para 85 ) or dharmasthana 
or dharmasana or sadas ( Vas. 16. 2 ) The Kadambari ( para 85 ) 
speaks of the royal palace as having a court of justice where 
the judges ( dharmadbikarins ) sat on high cane seats The time 
for holding the court is the morning, ace. to Manu VJL 145, 
Yaj. 1 327. Kaut states that tbe king 370 should look into the 
disputes of people in the 2nd part of the day divided into eight 
parts. The Dasakumaracarita (note 367 above) shows the same 
thing. Kat. (61-62) prescribes that the time for holding the 
court as laid down in the sastras is three parts of tbe day after 
the first part (when the day is divided into eight parts) i. a. 
from 7-30 A. M. to noon. There were holidays on which 
courts were closed i. e on 8th and I4thfa'£fas, Full Moon day and 
the amauasya of every month ( Samvarta ace. to Par. M. HE. p. 23, 
Harlta, ace. to S. V. p. 72 ). The sabha is said to have ten angas

m ] Judicial procedure in Mrcchakatiha 279 

v In the drama Mrcchakatika (Act IX) we have a graphic, 
though brief, description of judicial procedure in ancient India. 
That drama is at least as old as the 4th or 5th century A. D. It 
is very instructive to compare the procedure described in it with 
that gathered from Nar., Br. and Eat. who constitute the leading 
triumviiate on law and procedure in the smrtis and who pro- 
bably flourished a little before and a little after the drama. It 
will be found on comparison that the procedure in the drama is 
in essentials the same as that of the three smrtis mentioned 
above, though there is some difference in minor details. The 
principal points in the drama bearing on judicial administration 
may be brought together here at one place. The court house 
was called ' adhikarana ' ; the chief judge was called adhikara- 
nika ; he was assisted by the iresthm ( a prominent merchant 
or banker) and a ]&\jastha\ all three are referred to as 
' adhikaTanabhojaka ' and are addressed as adhikrta or myuUa 
( appointedby the king ) ; when a despot was on the throne, the 
judge's position was precarious and he could be deprived of the 
post at the king's sweet will ( the Sakara, king's brother-in-law, 
threatens the chief justice with summary dismissal ). There was 
a servant who arranged the seats in the court, inquired whether 
there -was any litigant, summoned Vasantasena's mother and 
Carudatta ( this man corresponds to the purusa or sadhyapala ) ; 
inquiry was made by the judges as to whether any one wanted 
to file a suit or complaint ; the sres^hin and kayastha are asked 
by the presiding judge to write down the important parts of the 
complainant's statement; a private person (who was not a 
relatave) could complain to the court about an alleged murder ; the 
judge allowed an old person like the mother of Vasantasens and 
a respectable and well-known citizen like Carudatta to occupy a 
seat when replying to questions from the court, but Carudatta 
was deprived of this concession when a pnma facte case was

mado out against Cirudatta by circumstantial evidence he was 
askod to confoss his guilt, otherwise he was told that he would 
bo whipped ( i. e this rofers to whipping to extort a confession, 
vide above note 332 ) ; the judge was only to pronounce the 
judgment and recommend the legal punishment, while the king 
had the last word about the exact punishment, Manu's work 
was an authority ; a brahmana offender was not to be sentenced 
to death, but was to be banished with all his wealth, though 
some kings did not act up to this rule ; impalement was carried 
out by candalas , ordeals of fire, water, poison and balance were 
known and Sudraka conveys {visasahlatnlagmprailhiteme weme) 
that Carudatta had prayed for trial by ordeal, but that the chief 
justice, bocauso thero were witnesses and circumstantial evi- 
dence, refused that request, 

The court so ,far described (i. e. where the king or the 
chief justice appointed by him presided) was the highest court. 
But other tribunals were recognized m the smrtis and digests 
Yaj. I 30 and War. (I. 7) state 371 that law-suits may be decided 
by village councils (lulSm), corporations (sre?n), assemblies 
(puga in Yaj , gam in Nar.), the judges appointed by the king 
and the king himself, each later one being superior to each 
preceding one The first three were practically arbitration

'gramasta-kuladhikaranam' in E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 at p. 348 in 
the reign of Ku maragupta I. From the Sanchi etone Inscription 
of Chandragupta II ( of the Gupta year 93 L e 412-13 AD.) it 
appears that panchayats were called 'pancamandall' (Gupta 
-Inscriptions pp. 29, 31). 'Sreni' means, ace. to most commenta- 
tors, 'the corporation of persons following the same craft or 
avocation , though they may belong to different castes ' such as 
horse-dealers, betei-leaf sellers, weavers and dealers in hide, 
Aoo. to the V. M. p. 280, ' sreni ' is an association of artisans ©r 
traders '. ' Pugas ' are assemblies of men of one place ( a village 
or a'town) belonging to different castes and following different 
avocations, Kat (225 and 682 ) distingnishes between gam and 
puga which he respectively defines as 'assembly of families' (kulas) 
(Sm. C. II p. 18, Par. M. HI p. 352) and ' assemblies of traders 
and the like ' ( V. R, p. 668 ) V. P. p. 30 says gam and puga are 
synonyms The king waB thus the highest court of appeal and 
next to him -was the court of the judges appointed by him 
Brhaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 281 verse 28) ordains 375 that the 
kulas, srenis and ganas that are well-known to the king may 
decide the disputes of litigants except those that fall under 
sate and that it was only the king who could carry out the 
order for fines or corporal punishments, i. e the arbitration 
courts could only decide disputes not involving sahasa and they 
had no power to execute their decrees about fineB and corporal 
punishments, but that their decisions had to be filed with the 
king, who, if he did not disapprove of them, put them into execu- 
tion. Pitamaha 376 appears to mention three classes of Stats 
courts, while Y&j andNSr. refer only to two (viz. that of the 
chief justice and that of theking himself ) : « a dispute decided in 
a village may be taken to the city and one examined in the city 
(court) to the king; a dispute decided by the king whether 
correctly or incorrectly cannot be reviewed.' It is distinctly

provided by Br. 377 (S B. E. vol 33 p. 282 verse 31) that the 
sabhyas are superior to the kutas and the rest, the chief jnstice is 
superior to sabhyas and the king is superior to all Pitamaha 3 "* 
provides that when a litigant is not satisfied with the decision 
given by a kala tribunal or the others, he can carry the matter by 
way of appeal to the king. Besides these courts it appears from 
Eautilya that the village headman {grumla or gramakuta) 
exercised certain summary powers such as driving out of the 
village a thief or an adulterer (III 10) and that he could try 
some offences (IV. 4, grumakutwnadfojaksam %a satri bruyut &c.). 
Even in the 20th century in the Bombay Presidency under the 
"Village Police Act (Bombay Act VHI of 186? ) the village head- 
man (called Police Patil) has the authority to try and on con- 
viction to punish with confinement for a period not exceeding 
twenty-four hours any person charged with the commission of 
petty assault or abuse within the limits of a village and the 
person convicted has no right of appeal to any court or magis- 
trate against such conviction and only the High Court has the 
power to entertain a petition for revision ( which it hardly ever 
does). Bhrgu 373 quoted in Sm. H. p 18 and other digesto 
says that there are ten tribunals common to all men viz. the 
village people, the assembly of the citizens of the capital, gana, 
sreni, men learned in the four vedas (or ndi/Ss viz. *»*HU 
and the rest), the wgiv*. hulas. fotU-as, jadges (appointed by

of various kinds such as ganas, pugas, vratas, srenis and others 
Rulikas may be the elders of the families of the plaintiff and the 
defendant. In the Damodarpur plates ( B. 1. 15 p 130 ) we come 
across one Dhrtimitra -who is described as 'prathamakulika'. 
The word 'pancakula' was applied to certain high officers in 
Gujarat and Kathiawad; vide I. A, vol. 11 p. 220 (Abu Ins. of 
Bhmiadeva dated Vikrama year 1265) and Tawney's translation 
of the Prabaimha-ointamani pp. 18, 84, 129, 149, 190 for 'panca- 
kula'. The provisions about the conflict between customs and 
usages on the one hand and siuh and smrli on the other will be 
dealt with in detail later on in another section. A few words 
may be said here about conflicts between smrtis. In disputes 
between residents of the same country, the same city or the same 
hamlet of cowherds or of the same capital or village, the decision 
should be according to their own conventional usages, but in 
disputes between these and others (who are not residents of 
those respective places) the decision must be in accordance with 
the sacred texts 333 (Sit. 47 q in S. V p 11, Par. M. HI. p. 41 ). 
Another rule is that when there is an apparent conflict between 
two smrtis, reasoning is to decide in ordinary life which should 
be followed or reasoning based on the actions of the aged and 
the experienced is to decide what text to follow ( Yaj. It 21 ) and 
the business of the interpreter consists in holding that one of 
the smrtis contains a general rule and the other an exception 
or that the two apply to different sets of circumstances ( visaya- 
vyavastha)or that an option may be intended. Voluminous 
glosses have been written on this one text of Yaj II. 21 right 
from Visvarupa in the 9th century downwards Another rule 
is that in the administration of justice dharmasastra rules have 
superior force to those of arthasastra This has been already 
referred to above (p 9) Bhrgu further provides that foresters may 
get their disputes settled by foresters, members of caravans by 
other members, soldiers by (a tribunal of) soldiers and those 
who stay in a village as well as in a forest may get their dis- 
putes settled either by villagers or by foresters by mutual

agreement and that the-fiv& tribunals for foresters and others are 
kuhkas (high officers or heads of families), sarlhas (members of 
caravans), headmen, villagers, citizens The texts f urtherprovide 
that in certain cases the court was to call in aid outsiders to help 
in deciding disputes. Vyasa 311 says- 'In the case of disputes 
among traders, artisans, husbandmen and actors it is impossible 
for others to give a ( correct) decision, hence such matters should 
be got decided by experts m those various matters' Br. states 
(hat in disputes among husbandmen, craftsmen (carpenters 
and the like), artisans (like painters), money-lenders, guilds, 
dancers, sectarians (like FSsupatas) and criminal tribes the 
decision should be made with the help of those who understand 
the conventions made by them and their usages. In disputes 
about the boundaries of villages and about fields in a village, 
four, eight or ten neighbours were to settle the boundaries (vide 
Manu VUL 258, Kaut. HL 9, Yaj. IF. 150-152 ). Kaut. 1 19 
and Br. 382 (q in V P. p. S3) say that disputes between those 
who have performed austerities or between those who are adepts 
in witchcraft and Yoga should not be decided by the king 
(unaided), but with the help of those learned in the three Vedas, 
as otherwise they may feel offended These quotations show 
that certain people could claim to be tried by their peers or at 
least by a jury. This jury system was resorted to for settling 
complicated questions of fact It is a very ancient system, being 
mentioned even by Gautama "" XL 31-22 'the king, having 
received help from the heads of husbandmen, merchants, cow* 
herds, money-lenders and artisans as regards disputes in their 
own groups, should finally decide what is just'. 

It has already been stated above that the king is to decide 
according to the smrtis He has also to take into contra £

castes 384 ( ace. to Manu VJ3I. II and HSrXta ). The eighteen low 
castes said to be outside the pale of the four varnas and asramas 
are enumerated by Pitamaha, viz. washerman, shoe-maker, nata 
(dancer caste), bamboo-woiker, fisherman, mleccha, bhilla, 
SbhJra, raatanga and nine others ( the names of which are not 
given here as the text is corrupt ). 

The foregoing gradations of tribunals did not all exist at 
all times in ancient and medieval India. One thing is, however, 
quite clear There was alwayB a court of the Chief Justice 
appointed by the ruling power and final appeal lay to the ruler 
himself. But as regards inferior tribunals usage varied For 
example, it appears from a decision of 1742 in which a.ruling of 
king Shivaji about a Kulkarni -oatan is set out that in Shivaji's 
time disputes could be taken before three different but inferior 
tribunals, viz the got ( i. e. the assembly of castemen ) which is 
somewhat like the kuja tribunal of the smrtis, or before arbi- 
trators hailing from a plaoe other than where the dispute took 
place or before the officers, balutedars and chief men of several 
villages round about. 335 

Manu (VIE 23} prescribes that the king fully dressed and 
with an undisturbed mind, after taking his seat in the Hall of 
Justice; should perform obeisance to the gods, the guardians of 
«» (eight) quarters ( Indra and others, as specified in Manu 
VU 4 ) and should then commence the work of looking into the 
legal business The transaction of' legal business has four 
stages (from the king's or judge's point of view) viz. first

lod by them and lastly tho decision. 386 When a litigant comes 
before the court at a proper time (i. e. when the court is sitting) 
and makes his bow, he (the king or judge ) should 387 address 
him as follows . — " What is your business ? What is the injury 
done to you ? Don't be afraid, speak out, man ! By whom, 
when, where and why ( was the injury caused ) ? When thuB 
asked whatever he replies should be considered by ( the judge ) 
with the sabhyas and brahmanas and if the matter be legally 
ontortainablo he ( the judge ) should deliver the seal (sealed order) 
to the plaintiff or order the bailiff to summon ( the defendant )". 
Those observations are made by Kat (86-88) Whatever a 
man, being excited by one of the emotions of love ( or anger 
or greed ), says before the court, should be first written down 
on a board or the like by the scribe ( NSr M II 18 ) 

Very elaborate rules are laid down about the summoning of 
the defendant or accused by Nar. (I 52-54 ), Br, Kat ( 96-100 ), 
Sukra ( IV. 5-102-106 ) and others. A few of the rules are BBt 
out below. The first person to be summoned is the one against 
whom a complaint based on suspicion or truth is made by the 
plaintiff or complainant But other persons may be called as 
defendants 355 either when the person proceeded against by the 
plaintiff puts forward another as liable to plaintiff's claim or 
makes another liable along with himself or when another person 
is accepted by the plaintiff (on behalf of another who is a minor 
&c ) or ( ace. to the Madanaratna ) another person himself comes 
forward ( as defendant ) The king should not require the personal 
appearance of the following persons the diseased, minors, very 
old (beyond 70), one in a calamity, one engaged in some

HI] Summoning the defendant 287 

religious lite, one who would suffer irreparable loss by coming, 
one in misfortune ( such as the death or disappearance of a 
dear relative), one engaged in the king's business or in a 
(religious ) festival, one intoxicated, a lunatic, one distressed, a 
servant, a woman 390 who is young and whose family is in 
straitened circumstances or who is of good family or who is 
recently delivered, a maiden who is of a higher caste than that 
of the complainant Nar. (I. 53} prescribes that cowherds 
when it is the season for taking cows for grazing, agriculturists 
in the sowing season, artisans actually engaged in work 
and soldiers engaged 3 *" in war should not be summoned to 
appear in person, while so engaged. In these cases some 
one on their behalf should be summoned as a representative. 
But it is provided that even these persons may be summoned with 
proper safeguards in important cases or grave charges, such as 
the killing of human beings, theft, rape, eating forbidden food, 
counterfeiting coins, high treason &c. But women who by 
their earnings support their families, unchaste women, prosti- 
tutes, women without family and women excommunicated for 
grave sins may be summoned to appear personally s* 1 . A person 
who is summoned and is able to appear but does not appear in 
person was to be fined according to the value or importance of 
ihe subject matter of dispute e. g. in slight causes fifty ( copper) 
panas, two hundred at least in the cases of middling value and 
500 panas at least in heavy causes (vide Eat. 100-101 quoted by 
Sm. C. H p 34, Apararka p. 607.) After taking the fine and 
waiting for 30 days or a month and a half the king may give 
a judgment in favour of the plaintiff, due to defendant's default 
But if the defendant does come after that time, the suit may 
be restored and proceeded with. 3 * But when there is an invasion 
by an enemy or a famine or an epidemic or disease the king 
should not impose a fine, but send a second summons In the 
case of those who are exempted from personal appearance ( as 
above) their relatives (son, father &c.) or some other person 

390. Compare sec. 132 of the Indian Civil Pro. Code (Act V of 19081

appointed by them (such as a pupil, servant &o. ) or one who can 
be recognised as their agent may be allowed to appear 3!& But 
no representative was allowed in serious charges cited above 
(vide Kat 93-95 q by Apararka p. 639, Sm 0, H p 34). If a 
father, brother, a friend, or a relative appears before the court for 
the real litigant, the law-suit may be proceeded with (Pitamaba) 
"Whoever carries on anything through another by appointing 
him to that task should be understood to have done it himself 
and the business transacted by such a representative or agent 
cannot be annulled If a person who is not a brother nor father 
nor son nor appointed to represent another prosecutes a law- 
suit for another, he is liable to be fined 39 * As the king was 
supposed to be the guardian of a minor's wealth, it appears from 
this that a king-could have appointed a guardian for the suit 
-when a minor was concerned. The above provisions show that 
maintenance and champerty were not encouraged by ancient 
Hindu lawyers. 

An interesting question arises whether lawyers as an 
institution existed in ancient India The answer must be that 
so far as the smrfcis are concerned, there is nothing to show that 
any class of persons whose profession was the same as that of 
modern counsel, solicitors or legal practitioners and who were 
regulated by the State existed. This does not preclude the idea 
that persons well-versed in the law of the smrtis and the pro- 
cedure of the courts were appointed (myukta) to represent a 
party and place his case before the court The procedure 
prescribed by Nar, Br and Kat reaches a very high level oi 
technicalities and skilled help must often have been ■*«&*?* w

saying that he is a very old friend of the family and has been 
appointed by the party to represent him. So he corresponded 
to what is called a recognized agent in the Indian Civil Pro- 
Code, Order HI r 2 ( Act V of 1908 ). In Sukra IV. 5. 114-117 
some important rules are given : 3 ** the person who is appointed 
to represent a party should get as his wages 1/16, 1/20, 1/40, 1/80 
or 1/160 part of the amount in dispute, that the wages become 
less and less as the claim in dispute becomes higher or if 
several persons employ one representative; one who knows 
dharmasastra and the procedure of law-suits should be appointed 
as representative and not any one who is deficient in these ; if 
the representative takes wages without knowing these he should 
be punished by the king. A representative is to be appointed 
by the party and not by the king at hie will ; if the representa- 
tive allows the matter entrusted to him to fail owing to his greed 
he is liable to be fined 395 . In the ' Questions of Milinda ' ( S. B-

Htslory of DhartnaiUstia [Vol 

E vol 36 p. 238) there is a passage about certain bMkhusin 
the city of Righteousness' {dliammanaqaia) who are styled 
dharnmapanikas' (dealer in dhanna) and are described as 
follows: '(Bhikkhus),who in the spirit and the letter, in its 
arguments and explanations, its reasons and examples teach and 
repeat, utter forth and recapitulate the ninefold word of the 
Buddha; such bhikkhus are called, O king, lawyers in the 
blessed one's city of Righteousness' and on p 339 there are 
' dhammasetthino ' (bankers of dhanna), which word reminds us of 
the srestbin in the Mrcchakatika. The dhammapamkas probably 
correspond to such lawyers as Smartadurdhara mentioned above 
The rules of Sukra make a near approach to the modern 
institution of the Bar and the fees prescribed by Sukra are 
similar to those allowed by the Bombay Regulation H'of 1837 
and b y Schedule HI to the Bombay Pleaders' Act (Bombay Act 
-X.VJ1 of 1920 ) The first legislative enactment in India to deal 
with lawyers for representing parties passed by the British 
Government was the Bengal Regulation VIE of 1793 which defin- 
ed the privileges, the fees {five per cent up to 1000 and then on 
a sliding scale) and responsibilities of vakeels (which word 
originally means 'agent '). 

The plaintiff may put under restraint till the approach of 
the summoner (the bailiff) by the king's order the defendant, 
who does not stand up to meet the claim (i e. is about to abscond 
or may abscond ) that is to be investigated ( or when the plaintiff 
spoke to him about the claim before coming to court) and

HI ] Nature of usedha 291 

who disregards the words of the claimant. This is called 
usedha which is explained by the Mit. on Yaj. U. 5 as restraint 
under the king's order. It is of four kinds viz. restraint as to 
{stham) place (eg. you are not to go elsewhere from your 
house or a temple), as to time (e. g. you must present yourself 
on the 5th of a certain month), restraint from going on (pi a. 
v&sa) a journey (till the suit is decided) and restraint from 
doing certain actions (e.g. you are not to sell certain property 
or to plough a certain field till the disposal of the suit) 3 ' 6 . 
The rules about asedha are laid down by Nar. (I. 47-54), Br. 
(q. by V. P. p. 42, Sm. C JL pp. 30-31 ), Kat 103-110 ( all quoted 
byV.P.pp 41-42, Sm. C. n. pp. 30-31) Nar. (1.54) states 
that those persons whose personal appearance is dispensed with 
as stated above are not to be subjected to asedha Narada 
provides that he who disregards the prohibitory order ( asedha ) 
of the court should be punished and that he who obtains a 
restraint order against a person that should not have been thus 
proceeded against should also be punished. Ace to Kat. that 
man who restrains the defendant so as to prevent him from 
exercising his limbs or from talking or breathing freely should 
be punished and not the defendant if he breaks such restraint. 
A defendant would not be liable to be fined, if he disregards a 
restraint order which ties him down to a river ford, or to a forest, 
to a bad place ( infested by thieves and tigers ) or at the time of 
an invasion (Nar I 49) There is a provision which looks like one 
for the appointment of a Receiver in modern times. Kat. ( 120 ) 
sayg * A king should not allow a litigant to proceed if the litigant 
retains the property or money which he has (been shown to have) 
seized ; it should be delivered over to the opposing litigant ( if

of the claim if the plaintiff's claim be found to be false (Y&],

down on a board ( or on the ground ) with a piece of chalk as 
narrated naturally by the claimant and then orra leaf (palm 
leaf or bark or paper ) when it is corrected ( after the defendant 
appears) and that the plaintiff may delete some matters from the 
original (draft of) plaint and may fill in gaps and that such 
amendments may be made in the draft till the plaint is finally 
Bettled. 401 It appears from the VyavahSTatattva (p. 205) that 
the pleadings (the plaint and the reply ) could be written down 
in Sanskrit or in the vernacular of the parties if they were 
ignorant The Mrcchakatika ( Act IX ) shows how the presiding 
judge asks the sresthin and kayastha to write down the words 
'not by me' as the complaint of the Sakara when the latter 
averred that Vasantasena. was killed by Carudatta and not by 
himself Theplaint could be amended till the filing of the reply ** 
(Nar H 7). Elaborate rules are laid down about the contents of 
the plaint by many writers from Kautilya (IDL 1 ) downwards. 
Kaut 403 states that in the plaint should be entered the year, 
season, month, fortnight, day, the documents (to be relied upon), 
the court (in which the plaint is lodged), the (amount of) debt (or 
other money due ) and the country, village, caste, family, names 
and occupations of the plaintiff and defendant together with the 
relationship in which they stood to each other. Kat ( 127-128

suits about unmoveable property, ten details should be recorded

grandfather and great-grand-father, mention of the former 
kings Kat. 124-126, Br (q in Sm 0. p. 36 and V M 
p. 294 ) give further details, which are passed over for want of 
spaco. All the details enumerated above need not occur in 
every plaint, but the necessary ones must be stated according 
to the facts of each case ,ttl 

These rules about the contents of plaints are very similar 
to those in the Indian Civil Pro. Code, Order VII rules 1-5 

In modern India no suit or appeal can be filed unless the 
plaintiff or appellant payB substantial court-fees (Rs 7| pbt 
cent npto Rs 1000 and 5 per cent for higher claims up to 5000 
and so on at reduced rates as the claim rises) It is interesting 
to see how the litigants in ancient India fared in this respect It 
appears that in disputes of a criminal nature no court fees had to 
be paid in ancient India The person found guilty had to pay to 
the king the fine declared in the Smrtis for offences or awarded by 
the Court. As regards civil disputes also nothing had to be paid at 
the inception of the suit Certain rules are prescribed by Kaut 
(HI 1) Yaj , Visnudharmasutra, NSr and others about payments 
to the 'king after the suit is decided, which payments may be 
regarded as in the nature of court fees Yaj H 42 and Visnudharma- 
sutra VI 20-21 state that m the case of suits for the recovery oi 
debts the debtor who admitted that he was a debtor (bit did 
not pay the creditor ) should be made to pay to the king 10 per 
cent on the amount decreed and the successful creditor should 
B av five per cent out of the amount decreed (as bhrh cm jbmb- 
?Z™ court fee )«*. When the debtor denies the fact of debt 
IltLXTand the reditor succeeds in establishing it the debtor 
Stouav the amount decreed to the creditor and an equal 

false claimant (i o. ^ "*W«^^£^X*

do so through wickedness or malice, should be made to paythe 
debt after recovering five per cent from the debtor. The Sm. 0. 
II. p 121 says that this applies to a case where the debtor admits 
his liability to the plaintiff. Manu VHL 139 gives milder 
rules: 'if a debtor admits before the Court that he is a debtor, 
then he has to pay a fine equal to five per cent on the amount 
decreed, but if he denied the fact of debt altogether, then he has 
to pay as fine ten per cent'. Manu VEX 59 which prescribes 
a fine twice of that amount which the debtor falsely denies oi 
which the creditor falsely claims contains a somewhat different 
rule (which Medhatithi says applies where parties are guilty 
of downright fraud, while VHL 139 applies where there is 
negligence or loss of memory &c.). In suits other than for 
debts such fines aie also prescribed e. g. in Yaj. H 26 for one 
who misappropriates a pledge, H. 33, II 188 (for breach of the 
rules of guilds and other groups), Yaj. II. 171 (where a person 
claiming to be the owner of lost goods and failing to prove his 
ownership of them waB fined panca-iandlia i. e a fifth part of the 
price of the goods). Kaut prescribes 41 " that when a party is 
guilty of contradictory pleadings, or does not cite witnesses 
though saying he has witnesses and ib defeated for these and 
similar reasons he has to pay a fine of 20 per cent of the claim 
and 10 per cent only if he relied on his own deposition ( and 
called no witnesses) and further the defeated party has to pay 
the costs via. the wages of the bailiff and of the subsistence 
allowance of witnesses. Therefore it may be said that in 
ancient times Indian litigants had an easy time, while in 
modern times litigation is often ruinous, what with the heavy 
court fees to be paid in several courts, the fees of legal practi- 
tioners and the expenses of witnesses and the delay of years 408 
The remark of Dr. Hart (in 'Way to justice' p. 17 ) is as applil 
cable to modern India as to England ' the plain tiuth is that 
the justice of the courts is unattainable by some citizens through 
want of the necessary financial resources; while in the case

In one of his most famous soliloquies Shakespeare (in 
Hamlet HL 1 ' Oppressor's wrong, the proud mans's contumely) 
the pangs of despised love, the law's delays' ) enumerates law's 
delays among the principal evils of human life. In modern 
India as in England 409 before 1873 delay in the decision of 
causes is a crying eviL In the rough and ready methods of 
administering justice in ancient India care seems to have been 
bestowed on disposing of cases as quickly as possible The 
story of king Nrga who caused delay has already been referred j» 
(p 243).Kaut (HL1) states that if the plaintiff, after the defendant 
files his answer, does not on the same day begin to support his 
oase (by evidence) he would he declared to be defeated, since 
the plaintiff comes to court after determining the strength of 
his oase, but the defendant does not do so (he is dragged to 
the court) ; that the defendant may be allowed an adjournment 
of three or seven days for his defence ; if he is not ready with 
Mb defence within that time he may be punished with a fine, 
ranging from 3 to 12 panas ; if he does not answer even after 
three fortnights he shall be punished with fine for parokta ( viz 
paflcabandha or daiabandha as stated above in note 407) and 
the plaintiff's claim would be recovered from the property of 
the defendant A similar rule is laid down in Manu vTIL 58. 
Yaj. IL 12 prescribes that disputes relating to sahasa (killing 
by poison or weapon), theft, abuse, assault, cows, charges of 
grave sins and women (about the chastity of all women and 
about ownership in the case of female slaves), the defendant 
has to make his defence at once, and that in other oases tune 
mav be granted at the discretion of the court HSr. L 4& » w

disputes about kine, women and children or when the matter 
is urgent i e. where loss or abandonment of the thing will be 
the result of delay ( G-aut. XlLL, 29-30 ). Brhaspati allows time 
even to the plaintiff if he is not able to put forward his case 
owing to his immaturity or lack of boldness. 410 Kat. (145-158 
quoted by Apararka p. 619, Sm. 31. p 42, Par. M: UL pp. 69-72 ) 
contains elaborate rules about adjournments. He says that 
according to the importance or otherwise of the dispute, one, 
three, five, or seven days may be allowed to the defendant to 
make his defence in disputes about debts, according as the debt 
was contracted three months ago or 6, 12, 20 or 30 years ago ; 
that even more than a year may be allowed if the defendant is 
an idiot or lunatic or is suffering from disease or if the subject 
of dispute or the witnesses arc in a foreign country ; that more 
adjournments than one may be granted in such cases; that 
according to Brhaspati in disputes about immoveable property 
also no adjournments should be granted ; that if the act of God 
{daiva) or the king prevents the defendant from making his 
defence he should not be declared defeated, but time should be 
granted to him to prove this. It is clear that with the advance 
of time adjournments became longer and more frequent in Kat. 
compared with the rigid rules of Kaut.. Kat. and Sukra 
(IV. 5. 167, 209 ) contain the last word on this point. According 
to them delay in deciding causes is tantamount 4 " to denial 
of justice ( dharmavyapath,, lit. death of Justice ). 

The sequence of stages in a law-suit is as f ollows : first 
the plaintiff makes his averments, then the defendant makes 
his reply; when both have finished, the members of the court 
speak (or deliberate among themselves) and after them (speaks) 
the judge ( Kat. 1S1 q by Apararka p. 611, Par. M. 1H. p. 58 )

Kat ( 122 q in Sm C 1L p 35, Par M ID p. 59 ) says that 
preference should be given to that litigant whose injury is 
greater or whose cause is more important than those of the 
rest. Kaut HL 20 went 41s so far as to say that judges should 
look into the causes of idols (or temples), hrahmanas, persons 
performing austerities, women, minors, the old, the diseased, the 
helpless, even if they did not come forward to complain nor 
should judges put forward the excuses of time (i.e. tho long

also points out the faults ( dosas ) of a plaint and explains them

between teacher and pupil, fathei and son, husband and wife, 
and master and servant This does not mean that law-suits 
beUeen these pairs aTe altogether prohibited but that suits 
between them are undesirable, that the king or judges should 
persuade them to desist from proceeding in Court, that if they 
persist the court has to decide the suits according to the

flimsy or trumpery grounds. Brhaspati* 19 says that a plaint 
that is mraitfiaka ( i. e the injury in which is very small or the 
monetary value involved is negligible) should not be entertained 
by the king This is on the principle of de minimis non curat lex 
( the law does not take account of trifles ) also embodied in 
sec. 95 of the Indian Penal Code. 

When the plaint has been finally settled, the defendant 
should be called on to reply in writing to the plaint in the 
presence of the plaintiff ( Yaj IT. 7, Nar. II 2 ) This is called 
uttaia ( reply ) or pialipaksa ( Nar, D. 2 ). When time may be 
given to the defendant for putting in his answer has already 
been stated above. 

The answer of the defendant must possess the following 
oharacteristics viz it must completely meet all the points of 
the plaint, it must not deviate from the truth, must not employ 
vague words, must not be self-contradictory, it should not be 
such as to require further explanation ( because of containing 
words in a foreign tongue or unknown or rarely used words or 
elliptical or badly arranged sentences ) ^ A reply is of four 
kinds, ( 1 ) mtthya ( of denial ), sampratipath or satyd ( confession 
or admission), kaiana or pratyavaskandana (of special plea or 
demurrer ), prannyciya or purvarwaya ( of former judgment or res 
judicata ) A reply of denial may take four forms (Nar IT. 5 ) 
viss. ( 1 ) this ( what is affirmed in the plaint ) is false, I do not 
know anything about it, I was not present ( when the transact-

other digests quote long passages from Kat , Br , Harlta, Vyasa 
and others on faults of vUam and illustrate them at length 
These have to he omitted for want of space One of the faults is 
'sarikara' (mixture or confusion or misjoinder of pleas in defence), 
For example, if the plaint alleges 'the defendant took gold, a 
hundred rupees, certain valuable clothes and a quantity of corn 
and has not returned any of them, ' and the defendant's reply is 
' I took the gold, I never took any rupees, the plaintiff donated 
the clothes to 'me, as to the corn plaintiff had already filed a 
suit against me and failed ' Here the reply contains all four 
varieties, viz. the 'first is a reply of admission, the 2nd is one of 
denial, the third is a special plea and the 4th is a plea of former 
judgment This is a sarikara But it is not meant that this 
reply would not he allowed All that is meant is that, as the 
hurden of proof varies, the adducing of evidence will not be 
allowed simultaneously, but one after another. Vide Mit, on 
Yaj II. 7, Par M HI pp 77-80 ■ These questions are concerned 
with oases in which several issues arise, the burden of proving 
some of which lies on the plaintiff and the burden of proving 
others lies on the defendant If a defendant does not come 
forward to give a reply, the king or judge should make him give 
one by soma (conciliatory words), bheda (threats) and other 
ways and if he does not give a reply for seven days after that,

There were many grounds on account of which alitigant became 
wi.at is, called him (a losing party) and some times either had his 
plaint dismissed or his defence struck out and a decree passed 
against him or he was simply fined. For example, Nar. IL 33 
speaks oi five kinds 423 of htm viz. one who changes his state- 
ments ( or pleading ), who does not prosecute his pleading by 
adducing evidence ( i. e. avoidB investigation ), who does not 
appear when summoned, who gives no reply, who disappears or 
runs away when summoned. Nar. I 56-61, II. 24 explain some 
of these and other hina parties. Kat. 202 ( q. by Sm 0. IL p. 47 ) 
prescribes that the above five should respectively be fined 5, 10 
12, 16 and 20 panas Nar. IL 25 states that in all civil disputes 
such as those about women, land or debts the litigant .does not 
lose his cause even if he commits a mistake in his statements, 
but he is liable to fine. This conveys that m disputes arising 
out of wrath ( manyukrta i. e. in criminal matters ) a person loses 
his cause if he is guilty of the above acts and he is prohibited 
from pursuing the matter again. Kaut HI. 1, Manu VOL 53-57 
contain in almost the same words, certain similar rules, Kaut 
calling the several actions causes of pardkia ( defeat ). Vide 
Yaj. IL 16, Sukra IV 5. 136, Kat. 191-210 for further details on 
dismissal for default and cognate matters. In these cases of 
hinauadtns, though a fine was imposed, a retrial could be ordered. 
When defendant filed his reply and parties joined issue in court', 
Br. and Kat say that they should not then be allowed to 
compromise the dispute privately without the permission of the

When the reply had been given the sabhyas had to consider 
tho question about the burden of proof. »■• says ' L sSya 
after considering the nature of the reply should call upon one 
01 the parties that ore in court to establish his case • ( Sm C H 
P 50 }. What a party sets out to establish is called saMm and 
tho means whereby the claim ( of the litigant) in its entirety is 
established is called sadltana ( Kat. 213 in V. P p. 79 ) Y&j & 7 
and Nfir. G 27 say that the party (on whom the' burden of 
proof lies ) should immediately ( after the reply u> g JTO n) mite 
down the means whereby he proposes to prove his averments 
This third stage (pada) is called lenya i. e. proof. Sadhya 
and LSiya are synonyms, krtya and sudtiana also are synonyms 
( Kit. in Apararka p 616, Vyasa in Sm. C. E. p 54 ). The rules 
about burden of proof are laid down by HarJta ( q in Mit on 
Ya] II. 7, Apararka p 616 ). In a reply of denial, the burden 
of proof is on the plaintiff, m a reply of former judgment or 
of a special plea, it is on the defendant and in a reply of 
admission no question of burden of proof arises Compare also 
Nar H. 31. The Mit on Yaj It. 80 states another rule that 
an affirmative proposition has to be proved by him who 
asserts it ( bhampratijftavSdina eva knya ) Yaj. n. 22, Nar. H. 
28-29 and IV. 69, Br. ( in Sm. 0. H p. 54 ), and others say that 
means of proof are two-fold, human and divine, and that docu- 
ments, witnesses and possession are the human means of proof 
{ Vas. 16. 10 also ), while the ordeals of balance and others are 
divine means. Yaj 3L 22, Nar. It. 29, Kat, 217 expxessly state 
that ordeals are to be resorted to only when none of the human 
means are possible or available. If one party relies on human 
means alone and the other offers divine means, the king (or 
judge ) has to accept human means and not divine ; in disputes 
among men, if there be human means of proof though reaching

{ or covering ) only a portion ( of the allegations in the plaint ) 
then human means should be accepted and not divine ones even 
though the latter may cover the whole ground (Kat. 218-219 
q by Mit. on Yaj. H 22). This latter rule is based on the 
proposition laid down in Yaj. H 30 and Visnudhaimasutea YL 22 
that when a party totally denies a claim and the opponent 
establishes by evidence a substantial portion of it, the judge 
may pass a decree against the denying party for the whole of 
the claim This is practically the same as the maxim ' omnia 
praesumuntur contra spoliatorem , . 43 ' Therefore the general rule 
was that the divine mode of proof was to be resorted to only 
in the absence of any human means of proof. Kat. 229 ( q. by 
Mit on Taj. 3L 22, Apaiarka p. 629 ) allows witnesses or ordeals 
when the dispute is started with reference to s3Jrasa, assault or 
abuse and causes that spring from force and Kat. 230 ( q in 
Sm. 0. H. p 51 ) provides that, in the case of a person guilty of 
sShasa perpetrated in secret, investigation has to be made hy 
divine proof. Kat. 225-228 ( q. by Mit. on Yaj. 31 22, AparSrka 
p. 629, Sm. 0. H. pp. 53-54) lay down certain rules about 
preference among the several means of proof: whatever are 
declared as the conventional usages of the associations of 
traders, of guilds ( of artisans ) and of groups ( of brabmanas ), 
the means of proving them are documents and not ordeals nor 
witnesses ; enjoyment m " ( or possession ) alone is weightier in 
the case of the making and ( the use of ) doors and ways, as 
also in the case of water-courses and the like ( i. e. in the case 
of easements) and not writing not witnesses; in the case of 
things promised to be given but not given, when a decision is 
to he given in disputes of servants with masters, in the matter 
of taking back a thing after it is sold or when a person having 
purchased a thing does not pay the price, in gambling and

of proof are witnesses and not documents nor ordeals Marlci 
( q. by Sm. 0. H. 60, ,V. P p 141 ) states that as regards the 
sale, mortgage, gift or partition of immoveable, property a 
document ( should be executed as it ) enables the person ( in 
whose favour it is executed ) to acquire ( clear ) title and freedom 
from doubt 13 ' (even after the lapse of years) It is in consonance 
with this that the Indian Legislature (in the Transfer of Property 
Act, IV of 1882 ) requires writing and registration as regards the 
sale, mortgage and gift of immoveable property Narada IV 75 
very concisely hits the special characteristics of each pramana: 
' a document is always strong, witnesses are strong (as evidence) 
only as long as they are alive, possession becomes strong aB 
time passes '. The comparative strength of the several kinds 
of evidence is well put by Brhaspati 433 : ' Witnesses are superior 
to inference ( circumstantial evidence ), a document is superior 
to witnesses, undisturbed possession for three generations is 
superior to all these ' Kat, 321 ( q. by Mit on Yaj II 80 and 
V. P. p. 80 ) gives the warning that when a litigant abandoning 
a strong ground or means of proof resorts to a weak one to 
prove his case, he would not be again entitled to rely on that 
( strong ground of proof ) after the members of the court have 
decided as to who should succeed This practically propounds 
the same rule as that of constructive jes^tcato contained in 
explanation 4 to section 11 of the Indian Civil Pro Code (of 1908)

Then Buhler { in ' the Origin of the Indian Brabml alphabet * ) 
started the theory that Biahmi was derived from a foreign 
Semitic script about 800 B O. and this hypothesis held the 
field for a long time (vide e. g. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist 
India ' chapters VH and VB3 ). Even Western scholars are not 
now prepared to accept this dating of Buhler; vide Cambridge 
History of India, vol. Lp. 141 (1922) The excavations at Mohenjo- 
daro tend to throw grave doubts on this theory and discredit it 
At Hajrappa and Mohenjo-daro there is writing (not satisfactori- 
ly deciphered yet) on burnt clay and pottery. The Piprahva 
vase shows writing on stone several centuries before the 
Christian era and the Sohagpur copperplate inscription is the 
earliest writing on copper plates yet discovered ( vide Annals 
of B. O B, Institute, Vol XL p. 33 ff ) This is not the place to 
discuss the questions about the origin of the art of writing in 
India and of the Brahml script. It cannot'be gainsaid that the 
most ancient dharmasastras refer to writing as well-known. 
Gaut XBX 4 appears to refer to a witness signing himself as 
such on a document Vas. 16. 10, Visnudharmasutra VI. 23, 
Yaj IL 22 mention ftfefiite (document) as the first means of 
proof Manu VUL 51 uses the word karam in the sense of 
document {arthepavyayamanam tu karariena vtbhavUam), in 
VOL 168 refers to documents obtained by coercion and in 
IS. 232 to fabricated royal edicts ( k&tasasana ). Kaut. has a 
special chapter (IL 10) on royal writings (sasana), in which 
he dilates upon the qualifications of the king's scribe, on the 
contents of an official document, the good points required in 
an official missive, on various divisions of writings 'and 4 on the 
faults m official writings that are to-be avoided. In L 11 Kaut 
prescribes that the king should hold consultations with absent 
ministers by sending a letter (palra, a leaf of palm or a piece of 
birch bark or similar material ) and in 1 19 states that consulta- 
SS- i etter (pcrfm) with the council of ministers 'should be 
held in the fifth part of the day. In H. 7 Kaut advises the con- 
struction of rooms with shelves for books containing -accounts 
{aksapaMam nfandhaputfahisthanam teirayet ). Vide also Kaut

what he was told, since in another place ( p. 83 ) he refers to

the formal plaint on a leaf {patra). The Lalitavistara (10th

of sandal-wood for learning the scripts ( -oandanamayam lipi- 
phalakam-adaya ).

attention to documents. A few Balient points only will lie

saying that if the Creator had not oreated writing which is lira

VH 2 divideB documents into three kinds viz. those written 
before the king (Le. by public officers), those bearing the 
superscription of witnesses and those without witnesses. The 
first is a document written in a state office by a scribe appoint- 
ed by the king and bearing the signature of the head or 
superintendent of the office. This is juBt like the registration of 
documents in modern India. Br. * 37 ( q by V. P. p. 141, V. May, 
p. 24) divides documents into three sorts viz. royal writing, 
writing made at a fixed place and that written in one's 
own hand. N§x. IV. 135 speaka of two kinds viz. one written by 
the executant himself in his own hand and that written by 
another; ( the first of these is valid ) without attesting witnesses, 
while the Becond requires to be attested. In the former no 
writer (lekhaka) nor witnesses are necessary, while in the 
latter both are necessary. Even now in India no deed concern* 
ing even immoveable property is required by law to he attested 
except mortgages and giftB. The author of the Sahgraha, the 
Mit. on Y&j. H 84 and several othera divide documents into 
rSjofcija (public) and jctoapada (private or of the common 
people ). The V. Mayukha (p. 24) says that Imtldhi and janapada 
are synonyms and janapada document is of two kinds viz. 
written by the executant himself in hiB own hand and that 
written by another, and that the first maybe without attesta- 
tion of witnesses, but the other must be attested. On Ysj. 3L 22 
the Mit. divides documents into sssana and ciraka. The first is 
the same as rajaktya ( described in Yaj. 1 318-320 ) and ciraka is 
practically the same as janapada writing. On Y&j. EL 89 the Mit 
remarks that a royal deed must be written in correct and* 
elegant language hut a document executed by ordinary people 
fa notiequlred to he in correct Sanskrit, hut may he written in 
the local dialect of the parties. Y&j. H. 89 states that a document 
written by the executant himself in his own hand is autho- 
ritative except when it is brought about by force or fraud 
«1. H. 84-87 prescribe that a document of debt or the

write at the end that the deed is approved by N' N (the execu- 
tant) son of so and so, that an even number (i e not less than 
two) should attest the dooument, stating their father's names 
and that ,they attest as witnesses and the scribe should write 
at the end that he wrote the document at the request of both 
parties. If the debtor or any witness cannot write, his signa- 
ture should be -made by another in the presence ' of all 
witnesses (Nar. q by Mit _on iTaj. II 87 and by Vy. Nir. 
p. 87 without name ). Rajaklya documents -:are of three 
kinds (aco. to, Br quoted in V P p 141, V May. p. 24) 
.viz iasana (a royal grant of land), jayapatm (a judgment 
deoiding a law-suit), ptasada-patia (a deed showing the king's 
pleasure at the devoted service or bravery of a person); ace. to 
Vasistha (q in Sm. G II p. 55 and V" May p 28) it is of four 
kind's viz iasana, jayapatra, ajnapatra (a royal command 
addressed.to feudatories, high or low officers like" the wardens 
of the marches ), prajfiapanapatra ( a writing of request addressed 
by.the king.to sacrificial priests, a purohOa, teacher, learned 
brahmanas or , other highly honoured persons), it is five-fold 
ace. to S iiV pp. 111-113 viz sasana, jayapatra, ajfiapatra, pra-

another and hands over the former deed to his own creditor). 
The two branches of private documents (janapada) are either 
araka or not ciraka; cirafca is defined as a document written by 
hereditary Bcribes residing in the capital, who are approached 
by the parties and bearing the signatures of the parties and 
witnesses and the names of their fathers (Sangraha q by Sm 
C lip 59, Par M UL p 127). Vide n. 437 above and Sukra H

regarding pledges (and other transactions) and the sequence 
of the sense and of the words in which is not contradictory 
or confusing. Sm C, H. p. 59 applies the word 439 paficarB^ia 
(on which five are recorded) to documents that areBignedby 
the creditor, the debtor, two witnesses and the scribe. The 
Sarasvatlvilasa p 114 holds that pancarwfkatw consists in 
having the creditor, debtor, witnesses ( as one item ), scribe and 
the matter to be written. Harlfca and Vyasa (q inSm. G.JL 
p. 59 ) employ the dual ( saksinau ), while Yaj II. 87 employs 
the plural Therefore ordinarily two witnesses sufficed, but in 
very important writings there should be more witnesses. Visva- 
rupa reads 'asamah' in Yaj. IL 87 and requires three witnesses 
as the minimum. Nar. IV. 137, Visnu* Dh. S VH. 6-10, Br. 
(S. B. E. vol 33 p. 307 v. 23.), Kat. (871) state that a document 
is invalid that is executed by a person intoxicated, by one 
already charged (with an offence), by a woman, a minor, that 
has been brought about by threats or deceit or coercion, by one 
dying, by one diseased, by a lunatic, or by those that are 
dependent. Visnu Dh. S. ( VJL 8-9 ) and Kat. 273 (q by V. M. 
p. 338, Apararka p. 686, Par. M. EX p. 131) state that a docu- 
ment may be held invalid owing to defects in the witnesses 
or in the scribe or to the fraud of the creditor or executant 

Nar. IV. 145, K5t (306-307), Samvarta (both quoted by 
AparSrka pp. 691-692 ) and Br. ( S. B. B. 33 p. 309 verse 31 ) say 
that no oral evidence should be allowed to contradiot the (terms

ment is always superior, that a writing can be refuted or 
superseded only by another document relating to the same

be confusion and an end to all written transactions 441 . If them is 
a conflict among documents then a jampuda document (written 
by ascribe and attested ) is superior to one written in the hand 
of the executant himself and a public document is superior 
to a janapada one ( Vyasa q. by Sm. C. H p 66 S. V p 122 ). 

Yaj. H. 91, Har. IV. 146 and Kat. 312 (q. by Apararka

when it is illegibly written, when it is lost or its letters have 
become indistinct (by lapse of time or other causes) or it has been 
stolen or is crushed or burnt or shattered into pieces, another 
document may be caused to be written ( if both parties agree ) , 
but if they do not agree and the contents have to be pTOved or 
if the executant denies his signature, then Nar. IV. 142 and Kat. 
( 282 q. by Sm C H p. 63 ) say that time may be given to bring 
it from the foreign country or the contents may be proved by the 
evidence of the attesting witnesses or of the scribe or of those that 
have seen it. This shows that the smrti law required the produc- 
tion of the document itself as primary evidence, but allowed 
secondary evidence only in exceptional cases *° K a document 
belonging to one man is produced by another the latter has to 
explain his custody of it 443 ( Vyasa q. by Apararka p. 690, Sm. C.

tion of a person or thing made in a mirror is seen as if it were real 
though it is unreal, so clever people can fabricate documents 
resembling (the genuine writing of a person). Vyasa (in

be carefully scrutinized and that no certain conclusion can lie 
established by documents alone ( in every case ), that women, 
minors and illiterate persons are deceived even by their relatives 
by the fabrication of documents bearing the names of these 
(women and others) and that this has to be investigated with 
skill. When there is a doubt about the genuineness of a docu- 
ment, it can he established by comparison with other documents 
admitted to be written or signed by the same person, by ratioci- 
nation, by the probability of the two parties being together at 
the time of the transaction, by citing the attesting witnesses, 415 
by the peculiarities or flourishes in writing certain letters or 
making certain signs (in the writing questioned and in other 
admitted writings), the previous transactions between the par- 
ties (or their subsequent conduct), and the source of the acqui- 
sition of the subject matter in dispute (Yaj II 92, Visnu Eh. 
S. VII 12, Nar. IV. 143-144, Kat 283 q. in Mit. on Yaj B. 92). 
Visnu Dh. S. (VH. 13) and Kat." 6 285-286 (q by Apararka

or the scribe be dead the authenticity of the document has 
to he ascertained by ( a comparison of the signatures on the 
disputed document) with other specimens of their handwrigng 
or signatures or other documents executed by the debtor. JtM

though all the three ( vis. the debtor, the witnesses and the scribe

that a certain copperplate purporting to be issued by Vijaya-

or Brhaspati by the digests ) state that when a loan ( recorded in 
a document) has not been expressly claimed by the creditor 
able to claim from a debtor who is able to pay off and who is 
at hand, the document loses its validity because a suspicion 
arises that the debt has been paid off and that a document 
executed more than thirty years before which has never been 
seen ( by any body ) nor read out ( by the creditor to any body ) 
does not attain validity even though the witnesses on it are 
living. Nar. IV. 141 is very similar to this last. Kst. 298-299,

p. 690-691) prescribe that if no objection is raised for

or pledge or of the settlement of boundaries, then the document 
ceases to be voidable Kat. 275 and Br. ( S. B. E vol. 33 p. 302

be declared ( pointed out ) by the disputant at the ( proper ) time 
( i, e. when they are produced ), while patent defects may be 
considered by the sabhyas at the time ( of the consideration of 
the evidence) by reference to the rules of the sastra. Yaj. 21 
93-94, Visnu Dh. S. VL 25-26 *» prescribe that when a debtor 
payB part of a debt, the debtor should write on the back of the 
document how much he paid or the creditor may hand over to 
the debtor a writing of receipt signed or written by himself, 
particularly when the original document is not at hand, and 
when the whole debt is paid or the contract is fully performed 
the creditor should tear off the document or should execute 
another document in order to make clear the fact of satisfaction 

The fabrication of royal edicts and private documents was 
so much condemned by the sentiments of society that Manu IX 
232 and Visnu Dh. S V. 9-10 prescribe the extreme penalty of 
death for such offences as in the case of the murder of women, 
minors and brahmanas. Yaj. H 295 ( = Matsya 227. 202 )

CHAPTER XII 

BHTJKTI ok BHOGA ( possession ). 

According to Gaut. X. 39 a man becomes an owner by 
inheritance, purchase, partition, seizure (appropriation of 
forest trees and other things which have no owner ) and find- 
ing ( i e appropriation of lost property the owner of which is 
unknown ). Gaut. (X, 40-41) adds ,that in the case of brahmanas 
acceptance (of a thing donated) is an additional mode (of 
becoming an owner ), that conquest in the case of a ksatriya and 
gain (by trade or labour ) in the case of a vaisya or sudra are 
also additional modes Vas. 16. 16 mentions eight tnodes. Bi. 
( quoted in V. P. p 153, Apararka p. 635, S. B. E. vol. 33 p 309 
v. 2 ) mentions seven modes of acquiring immovable property 
viz. by learning, purchase, mortgage, valour ( i e. conquest ), 
through the wife ( as dowry ), inheritance ( from an ancestor ) 
and succession to an issueless kinsman. Narada ( q. in Sm. C. II 
p. 70} mentions the same except mortgage, None of these 
expressly says that long possession is by itself a source ot 
ownership Great divergence 41 ' has prevailed throughout the 
centuries among the sages and digests about the relation ot 
title and possession and about the length of possession necessary 
for making a person secure in his right to property by reason 
of possession Possession ( bhukk ) may be with title ( sagamo ) 
or without title ( ariagama ). Agama means ' origin ' or ' source 
of title ' such as purchase or simply ' title *. 4s0 Manu VDX 200, 
Yaj n. 27, Har. IV. 84 employ that word in that sense Vide 
Kat 317 (q. in Sm. O II p 73 and Par. MIILp 141) If property 
is held in one of the modes of acquiring ownership stated above 
and there is also possession, one's right to that property is 
indefeasible ( Nar. IV. 85, Br. q. by Sm. O. H. p. 70, S. B. E. 33 
pp. 309 and 312 v. 3 and 22 ), but possession without a clear title

doss not lead to (or ripBn into) ownership 451 (with certain 
exceptions to be noted later on) Vyasa and Pitamaha 4SJ 
declare that possession in order to be valid must have five 
characteristics viz it must have title behind it, must he of 
long standing, unbroken, free from protest ( by another person) 
and in the presence ( i. e before the very eyes ) of the opponent 
( q in Mit on Yaj II 27 and Apararka p 635 ) Even title, if 
not accompanied by some slight possession, has no strength, 
while title is stronger than possession not handed down 
hereditarily ( Yaj 1L 27 ) Nar. IV. 85 states that possession 
becomes strong when hacked by clear title. These passages 
present some difficulty and make title and possession depend 
on each other. Har. IV. 77 states that even if there be a 
document or witnesses to support a man's title, when there is 
no enjoyment, particularly in the case of immovable property, 
there is no validity All that is meant is that a transfer 
without possession though under a deed or before witnesses is 
risky and that title and possession lend support to each other 
as stated by Nar IV. 84-86, Br , Harita and Pitamaha *» Ear 
( IV. 86-87 ) declares that one who pleads mere possession and 
no title at all should be considered a thief on account of his 
putting forward the deceptive plea of possession ( which even a 
thief can assert) and that the king should punish as a thief 
one who enjoys a property even for hundreds of years without 
title. All that this last verse means is that the person in 
possession must prove legal origin or such a long possession 
that there is no possibility of an inference that the possession

of Ms ancestor originated is -wrong. Delivery of possession 
was the principal mode of transferring ownership in ancient 
times in almost all systems of jurisprudence and so possession 
was given great weight as evidence of ownership. 451 The Mit. 
on Yaj. U. 27 makes the position clear. In the case of a gift 
or sale there must he the cessation of the ownership of the 
transferor and the arising of the ownership of the transferee. 
This last occurs only when the transferee accepts the property 
and not otherwise. Acceptance is mental, vocal and physical 
(is. the acceptor makes a resolve to accept, says that he 
accepts and takes physical possession). These three may 
exist in the case of such movahle articles as gold, clothes &c 
But in the case of a field physical acceptance is not possible 
except by enjoying the fruits or profits thereof Therefore in 
order to make a gift or sale perfect there must he some slight 
possession at least In the absence of such possession mere 
title is weak. Title may succeed against the man in possession 
who has no title and who has not been in possession for the 
prescribed period ( such as three generations ). If the possessor 
proves possession for that period he will succeed against one 
who has bare title and no possession whatever. If it is known 
or proved that a man purchased from A but got no possession 
and that another purchased from' A subsequently and got 
possession "(but was not in continuous possession for the 
prescribed period) the prior title though without possession 
will prevail over the later one, aec. to Yaj. II 23. But when 
it is doubtful as to which title is prior and which posterior the 
one with possession will prevail. Where the possession has 
been uninterruptedly with a man's ancestors for three genera- 
tions he will succeed against one who has bare title. Therefore 
possession was not absolutely indispensable for transfer even 
ace. to the Mit. and other works, but title without posses- 
sion was risky and so possession was insisted upon as it was 
mne points of law '. It follows, ace. to the Mit., that (1) when 
possession was comparatively of short duration . and not 
supported by any title much weight was not attached to 
possession and title by itself would prevail against it, that (2)

Hie question of what 1$ long possession. Yaj II 24 literally 
translated moans ' los-- of land results in twenty years when it 
is enjoyed by a stranger before the owner's very eyes and 
without any protest from him and loss of chattels (results 
under similar circumstances) in ten years '. Manu VHI 147-148 
and Narada IV. 79-80 have two verses in common which mean 
' If the ow nor of anything silently looks on ( i. e raises no 
protest) whon it i.s being enjoyed in his presence for ten years by 
strangers he doos not deserve to recover it (i.e be loses the thing). 
When tho owner is not an idiot nor a minor and his property 
is enjoyed within his sight then the property being lost by 
his conduct (ii/uualiara) comes to belong to the enjoyer . 
Gaut XH. 34 has almost" 6 tho same words as Manu Vffl 148. 
Sankha (in V.Bp 308) also refers to ten years. These passages 
apparently moan that at the end of 20 or 10 years' adverse 
possession by the wrongful possessor the ownership of tfce 
original owner is lost and the wrongful possessor becomes tne 
owner. But there are several other smrti passages where it is

to be supported by title only during wmSrtakdla ( daring human 
memory), but in cases beyond human memory possession con- 
tinued successively for three generations (or ancestors) is 
proof of ownership even in the absence of a document (or other 
title). Visnu Dh. S. V. 187 is in similar* 57 terms. The Mit. 
on Yaj. (]1 27 ) says that sniartakala is a period of 100 years, 
as the Veda declares that the span of a man's life is 100 years. 
For a hundred years it is possible for witnesses to depose to 
the origin of possession. So if there is possession for less than 
one hundred years, oral evidence can be adduced for establishing 
its origin, and title will have to be proved by the possessor and if 
no oral evidence is adduced to prove title, it is a case in which 
it may be held as certain that there was no title to begin with. 
Mere possession is not enumerated by sages like Gautama 
among the means of acquiring ownership. As the Sarasvatl- 
vilasa (p. 124 ) puts it, long uninterrupted possession only leads 
to an inference that it originated in title acquired by sale, gift 
or the like i. e. there arises a presumption of lawful origin 458 
Therefore in order to enable a man to rely on possession alone 
as proof of ownership it must extend uninterruptedly over 100 
years (ace. to the Mit ). The Smrtioandrika 459 (H. p. 72) 
accepts this meaning, only requiring 105 years' possession in- 
stead of 100 years'. Ace. to a smrti quoted by it each genera- 
tion means 35 years and so when Hfarada requires possession 
for three generations 105 years are meant (ace to Sm C) 
Vsna Dh. a V. 187, Kat (327) also hold that continuous 
enjoyment for three generations makes the fourth generation

(in order to be proof of ownership as to land); but in cases 
beyond the memory of man possession extending over three 
generations in succession { is independent proof of ownership), 
since there is no certainty that there was no title (to begin with) '. 
Vide also Br. (in S. B. E. vol. 33 p 313 verses 26-28). 'Three 
generations 1 is a vague ezpression. The great-grandfather, the 
grandfather and the father of a man may die in the space often 
years and if the gieat-grandfather took possession wrongfully and 
all died within ten years of the time of taking possession one after 
another, the fourth in descent might urge that there was posses- 
sion for three generations and that he had become owner. 
Therefore Eat. in another verse (318, q by Apararka p 636 and 
V. P. p. 155) laid down that unbroken pobsession for three 
generations extending over sixty years becomes firm ( indepen- 
dent means of proof of ownership ) Thus tnpunisa-bhoga or 
puroafa-amugala-bhofja ( in YS] H 27 ) means the same thing as 
possession continuing from a time beyond human memory 
( asmaita-kala ) and is equal to 60 years ace. to Kat , Vy&sa and 
a few other srarti writers* . Narada (q. by Apararka p 636) 
says that as regards possession one generation means twenty 
years, while Br. (q by Sm. 0. IL p 72) says it means thirty 
years. It will be noticed from the above that early authors lira 
Gaut,Manu.,Yaj appear to lay down 20 years' ^yerse enjoy- 
ment of land as sufficient to create ownership, while other ana

is svaluiham) 461 . The 2nd explanation is that the meaning of 
Yaj. II 24 is that after 20 years' enjoyment by a stranger, if the 
owner brings a suit and relies on a document in his favour, he 
runs the risk of being nnable to prove hiB ownership barely on 
the strength of the document, since it is possible to argue that, 
even though he had a docnment, by his silence he acquiesced in 
the stranger taking possession and tacitly consented to it. 
Therefore all that Yaj n. 24 means or recommends is that an 
owner should not be negligent (iipefcsa) or should not remain 
silent when a stranger .takes wrongful possession This view 
was first started by VisvarCipa among extant writers and it 
approaches the modern idea of requiring vigilance in the asser- 
tion of ones' rights 462 , that is there is only loss of the suit, 
(vyavah&rahani). This View lays emphasis on a verse attri- 
buted to Nar. and the word ujuvahaia in it and in Manu VIII 148 
and ISaiada IV. 80, where the word means lawsuit also, the idea 
being that the sages declare only what would happen or be 
decided by the judges in a law court and do not intend to say 
that the decision would be just or righteous from the higher or 
the moralist's point The third view is that of the Mit. ( followed 
by the Vyavaharamayukha, Mitoainisra and several others) 
which 463 explains that the loss is not that of the ownership of 
the thing itself but of the produce of it ( there is only ' phala- 
Mm ') i e. if without protest the owner allows a stranger to 
remain in possession before his very eyes for twenty years and 
then he brings a suit, he may succeed in getting back his land 
hut he would lose his claim to the profits of the land. The Mit„ 
the Vyavaharamatrka and V. P (pp 157-165) contain very

elaborate discussions on Yaj. IL 24; but consideratioDs of space 
forbid any further reference to them. The V M M connects 
Yaj IX 24 with the preceding verse (viz that in mortgages, gifts 
and sales a prior transaction prevails over a later one) and 
remarks that this verse (Yaj. n 24) says that if a person after 
a gift, sale, or mortgage to him allows the property to remain 
with the seller, donor or mortgagor, who subsequently transfers 
it to another with possession and the latter holds it for twenty 
years, then the first dealing though prior is of no avail (as it is not 
accompanied with possession for 20 years). Srikara (as stated 
in the Vyavaharamatrka) tried to reconcile the conflicting 
smrti texts by holding that in twenty years the real owner lost 
ownership if he was present and did not protest while a stranger 
was in possession, but passages speaking 'about possession for 
three generations (or sixty years) applied only where the owner 
was absent. The Mit. and others point out that YSj IL 24 
(who employs the words 'pasyatah* and 'abruvatah' ) conveys 
that if a stranger takes possession while the owner is absent or 
if the owner protests, then even 20 years' possession does not lead 
to the loss of anything. The text of Nar. IV. 87 quoted above 
(p. 318) shows that the sage held that possession for several hundr- 
ed years even would not avail the possessor if it is certain or 
established that the possessor had no title at all to begin with 
or that his possession started wrongfully. This text is empha- 
sized by those who favour title and want to discourage persons 
benefiting by their own wrongdoing But there are other 
smrti texts of a contrary tenor. For example, *«•**•"

ICE ] Inference of title from lon-q possession 325 

to an inference of title (iripiirusarbhukUoBdmah, as Medhatithi 
on Manu VUI. 148 calls them). These like the Vyavahara- 
tattva and Vivadaoandra 465 who rely Bolely on possession 
holdly say that long possession even originating in wrong 
leads to ownership. Medhatithi says ' there can be no memory 
of the origin of title when there has heen possession for hundreds 
of years and ( if title had to bo proved for the origin of such 
possession) a king may resume villages enjoyed by ancient 
temples, brahmanas and mathas ; therefore ancient possession 
is evidence of ownership because it makes it extremely probable 
that the ancient possession originated in gift or the like'. 
The Mit. on Yaj. n. 27 (which is soatvavadi) refers to all the 
three views, refutes the first two and accepts the view of loss of 
profits It does not literally interpret the texts of Harlta and 
NSrada quoted above, takes them to be over-statements and 
intended to convey that continuous possession for over three 
generations cannot be interfered with even if there is no clear 
proof of the origin of title In modern India under the Indian 
Limitation Act (IX of 1908) the tendenoy is to prescribe the 
very short period of twelve years for adverse possession in order 
to defeat a title, following the English Real Property Limita- 
tion Act of 1833 (3 and 4 William IV chap. 27), sec. % of which 
insisting on vigilance by every one about one's rights however 
prescribes the period of 20 years within which to bring an action 
for recovery of land. Modern case law has rather gone too far 
and sets a premium on wrongful possession by holding that it is 
not necessary that adverse possession should have been brought to 
the knowledge of the real owner « s Ancient Hindu lawyers 
put down the tendency to usurp another's property and placed 
many obstacles in the way of the wrongful possessor. 

It may be noted that there were a few rare texts that 
referred to very short periods for possession causing loss of

title, viz. 3 years for immovable property ( provided there was 
no permissive origin, ksamahnga ) or one year for corn, cattle 
and other movables'* 67 . This idea being opposed to innumerable 
texts was explained away as merely conveying the great im- 
portance of possession. Marici states 468 that cows, beasts of 
burden, ornaments that are borrowed through friendship should 
be returned within four or five years, otherwise, the owner 
would lose them This is opposed to Manu VIIL 146 and other 
texts and so is explained as being applicable only if there is no 
sufficient cause for allowing them to remain with the borrower. 
The ancient Roman Law was very like this. Before Justinian 
the Eoman Law gave the ownership of a thing by quiet posses- 
sion bona fide and founded on good title if maintained during 
one year ovei movables and during two years over immovable 
property 4W . Justinian altered this and provided that possession 
during three years gave ownership of movables and possession 
during ten years ( if parties lesided in the same -province) or 
during twenty years (if they did not) gave the ownership of 
immovable property. , 

Br ( S. B E. vol. 33 p. 314 verse 31) lays down the proposi- 
tion that if a person has title and is already in possession and 
is dispossessed by another then he may. succeed m a lawsuit 
on the strength of his prior possession provided the dispossessor 
does not establish continuous possession for three S e ~ ons ' 
This is similar to a suit in ejectment contemplated by .an i»« 
of the Indian Limitation Act. 

Br (S B E vol 33 p. 310 v. 11) and Kat. 335 ( both quoted

possession ( as leading to ownership ) in cases other than these. 
PitSmaha states that possession hy a stranger is powerful, but 
possession by members of one's own family has certainly not 
the same force 471 . This appears to adumbrate the principle of 
modern law that possession by one co-owner or one tenant-in- 
common is ordinarily the possession of all co-owners and the mere 
fact that the profits of a property have been enjoyed by only one 
co-heir or tenant-in-common for many years does not by itself 
amount to the ouster of the other tenants-in-common m . It is 
stated in Gaut. XII. 35 that property which is enjoyed for a long 
time by a srotriya, an ascetic or a king's officer is not lost to the 
owner by that enjoyment, since the owner may have thought that 
he would reap long-enduring spiritual merit by the first two 
enjoying this property ( such as a vacant house) or that he might 
be prevented from asserting his right from fear ( of the royal 
official ). Compare Br. ( S B. E. vol 33 p. 311 v. 12 ).*» Manu 
VIE. 149 { =Nar. IV. 81 and Vas. 16. 18 ), Yaj II. 25, Br. { S. B. 
& 33 p. 312 v. 21 ), Kat. ( 330 ) state the following exceptions 
to the rule of loss by long possession; a mortgaged or pledged 
property, boundary, minor's property, an open deposit, a sealed 
deposit, women ( female slaves ), the property of the king i. e. 
(of the State) and the property of a brahmana learned in the 
Veda aie not lost by the possession of another (for twenty or 
ten years referred to in Manu VBL 147 and Yaj. BL 24 ). Manu 
VDX 145 provides that neither a pledge nor a deposit can be 
lost by lapse of time and that boih are recoverable even if they 
have remained long ( with the pledgee or depositee ). Yaj EL 25 
adds to the above list the properties of idiots and of women. 
«S*. IV. 83 emphatically states that women's property ( strl- 
dhana) and state property (land) is not lost even after 
Hundreds of years, when it is enjoyed without title. Eat ( 330 ) 
adds to the above list temple property and what is inherited

from tho father or mother 47 *. All systems of jurisprudence 
throw protection round the interests of minors, persons of un- 
sound mind and others similarly situated and provide longer 
periods of possession for loss of their right The Mit. on Ysj 
(I. 25 gives reasons why tho several exceptions are made - m the 
caso of a pledge or mortgage the property is enjoyed hy the 
plodgoe or mortgageo under an agreement and so there is no 
fault on the part of the owner if he remains quiet while the 
ptopeity w being enjoyed hy tho creditor, boundaries between 
villages can be easily established by such signs as trees ( grow- 
ing on the border ), streaks of chaff and coal ( buried under- 
ground ) , deposits are entrusted to a person out of confidence 
foi being prceTved and not for enjoyment ; idiots and minors 
are ignorant or incapable of understanding their rights, the 
king being engrossed in numerous state affairs may not be able 
in time to look into the question about possession of state 
properties; women on account of their ignorance and timidity 
may not assort their rights and a learned brahmana being 
devoted to learning, teaching and performance of rites and 
duties may have no time to go to law. In modern times also the 
law favours minors and other persons as indicated in the note

Kst 346 (q in V if p 317 and V. P p 106) provide that a

evidence of a witness must be direct and should not be what is 
called hearsay. Medhatithi (on Manu VUL 74) says 4 * that 
hearsay evidence occurs when a person who hears from another 
that has himself heard something from another comes forward 
as a witness and that hearsay is no legal evidence. Manu 
VUL 76 prescribes that even though a man may not have been 
expressly asked or appointed by the parties (in the words 'you

the Visnu Dli S. VIH. 12 is that 481 when a person that is appoin- 
ted as a witness is dead or gone abroad, those who have heard what 
he said may give evidence It has already been stated (p 297} 
that a king was not to delay the examination of witnesses Kal. 
( 340-341 q by A^pararka pp 675, 677, Sm C. H. p 92, V. M p. 331 ) 
prescribes that the king ( or the chief judge) shoul d himself exa mint) 
the witnesses that are present (in court) and should consider along 
with the sabhyas the statements made by witnesses and th.tt, 
where it is doubtful who the witnesses on a disputed matter are, 
time should he given for producing the witnesses m order to 
ascertain the proper means of proof hut that where it is clear 
who the witnesses may be he should make the hearing of the 
case proceed at once Kat (35a) further prescribes 482 that when 
it is impossible to bring witnesses because they reside in a 
foreign country, evidence taken m writing before a man learned 
in the thTee Vedas and sent by him should be read in deciding 
the cause* 83 . Gaut. 13. 2, Manu VIET.. 60, Yaj. H 69, Nar. IV. 
153 and others require that ordinarily there should be at least 
three witnesses in a cause. Br. (S. B E 33 p 301 v. 16) says 
that there may be nine; seven, five, four or three witnesses, or 
two only H they are learned brahmanas 48 *. Visnu Dh S VIII 
5 and Br. (S. B. E vol. 33 p 301 v 16) emphasize that a single

the like which are of a fixed nature ( of a civil nature ), but 
that in complaints about all kinds of sahasa ( heinous crime ), 
in robbery, adultery or the two kinds of parusya ( viz. defama- 
tion and assault ) there should ba no ( strict ) inquiry into the 
character of witnesses ( that is, all can be witnesses in such 
cases) and that even those like slaves and fault-finders who 
have been enumerated among incompetent witnesses can become 
witnesses in grave matters 456 . The idea is that in such cases 
the witnesses need not be strictly examined as to their possess- 
ing the good qualities ordinarily required in witnesses But 
this does not authorize the examination of such persons aB 
lunatics or idiots as witnesses, because they have not the power 
to understand things Manu VIII 77 emphatically states that 
even a single male, if he is free from greed, may bo ( suffi- 
cient as 1 a witness, but not women of good character, even 
though they be many, since the feminine intellect is apt to be 
unsteady But even Manu had to concede ( Vm 70 ) that a 
woman or a minor or a very old person or a pupil, relative, 
slave or a hired servant may he a ( competent ) witness, if it 
is impossible to find another witness { in matters that occurred 
inside a house or in a forest or in crimes where life is lost ). 
Kat 367 (q by Apararka p. 671) says the same thing. Usanas 497 
( quoted in the Sm. H p 79, V. P. p. 120 ) provides that even 
a slave, a blind man, a deaf person, a leper, a woman, a minor, 
a very old man may be (competent) witnesses in saJutsa 
provided they are not interested in the matter of dispute 
(or are not related or partial to the parties). Nar.(lV 190- 
191 ) t gives it as his view that even when there is to be no strict 
inquiry into the character of witnesses in sahasa, still a minor 
a woman, a single person,- one who forges deeds ( or wlio is a

cheat ), a relative and an enemy cannot be witnesses in sahasa, 
since a child through ignorance, a, woman from her habit of 
untruthfulness, a forger ( or cheat ) because he is accustomed 
to doing evil deeds, a relative from affection and an enemy 
from the idea of taking revenge may speak falsely There was no 
total disqualification of women as witnesses, since Manu quoted 
above allows them to be witnesses in disputes between womenand 
in cases where it is not possible to have other witnesses. Medba- 
tithi on Manu VUL 68 holds that women are disqualified as 
witnesses only where the plaintiff and defendant are both males 
but that where there is a litigation between a man and a woman 
or between women alone, a woman may be a competent witness. 
Ancient Hindu Law is not singular in its partial rejection of the 
testimony of women. Vide Best on Evidence ( 12th ed. of 1922) 
pp 53-56 where it is shown how ancient Boman Law and the 
Medieval laws of several countries of Europe more or less 
excluded the testimony of women, how some States in the U S A. 
excluded the testimony of negroes and persons of coloured 
blood. By the Canon Law more credit was given to male 
than female witnesses ( Taylor on Evidence, ed. of 1848 p. 655, 
noted). 

Nar. (IV. 157-172) states that incompetent witnesses fall 
into five classes : (1) some* 9 * like learned brabmanas, very old 
men, ascetics, persons practising austerities are incompetent 
because ancient texts (vacana) say so and there is no otter 
(special) reason for their exclusion. The Vyavaharatattva

HI ] Fiue classes of mcompetent witnesses 339 

(p. 214) points out that srotriyas and others cannot be appoint- 
ed as witnesses, but they may be what is called akrta witnesses 
explained below (i e. they may if they choose appear as 
witnesses in a cause ). They are not competent like the king, 
not because they are untrustworthy but because it is not advisa- 
ble to call them. They were privileged persons; (2) thieves, 
robbers, dangerous characters, gamblers, assasins are declared 
to be incompetent because there is the defect (dosa) of untruth- 
fulness in them ; (3) witnesses are rendered incompetent on the 
ground of contradiction ( bheda ), when the statement of wit- 
nesses who have been accepted by the king for determination of 
the same matter do not agree; (4) he who without having been 
appointed ( by the parties to a tiansaction ) as a witness (to it) 
comes of his own accord to depose is termed a sucl (i. e a spy) 
in the iasb as (and so was styled siayamukh by Nar. IV. 157) and 
is unworthy to be a witness; (5) a person is incompetent as a 
witness by reason of intervening death ( i e. he is mrbzn&oa); 
when can any person bear testimony if the creditor (or claimant) 
is no longer alive, whose claim should have been heard by him 
specifically ( but was not heard in that way)? M Honiara is a 
witness whom one or other of the parties informed in a geneial 
way that there was some dealing between the parties and who 
was asked to be a witness ( but was not told the details of the 
dealing ) and then subsequently the party died. In such a case 
the person told is not a good witness, as he cannot give the 
details. But Nar. ( IV. 94 ) mentions an exception to this last 
rule viz when a father while on the point of death tells his 
sons and the like ' these are the witnesses on such and such a 
matter,' there even after the father's death those witnesses would 
be competent Jihough death intervenes. 

"Witnesses are divided by Nar. IV. 149 into two sorts; 
(1) those appointed (krta) by the parties and (2) those not 
appointed {akrta); the first being of five kinds and the last of 
six kinds. The first five ( ace to War IV 150 ) are a subscrib- 
ing witness (hkluta), one who has been reminded (smimta) 
i e. one who is called as a witness without there being a docu- 
ment and who is present at a transaction and is again and again 
reminded of it by a party to it in order that the tiansaction 
may be effectively proved thereafter ( Kat. 371 and 372 q. in 
Mit on Yaj. IL 68 ), a casual witness i e one, who, while a 
transaction is being entered into, comes there by mere chance 
and is then asked to be a witness (yadrcchabhijfla or yadrcchika

of witnesses that are practically the same as the eleven of Nar. 
except one which he adds viz feftfeto 5 " (one whose name is 
caused to be written by a party in the presence of the witness 
when that party enters into some transaction in writing such 
as a loan with another ) The only difference between ' likhita*

name as a witness on a document while the latter's name ia 
written as a witness by one party m the presence of the other

q. by Apararka pp 666-667) dofines at great length all the 
twelve and Eat also defines most qf them, but these defini- 
tions are passed over as not very important. Visvarupa 
remarks that these nice distinctions among eleven kinds of 
witnesses are made only for the sake of exposition and for the 
benefit of simple people 501 .

jjj J Shaking the credit of a witness 341 

Before a witness for a party begins to depose, it is the duty 
of the opposite party to point out the ground or grounds,if any, 
of the incompetence of the witness put forward for examination. 
Kat. adds 502 that the latent defects of the witnesses of a party 
must be pointed out by the opposite party, but the patent 
defects wilt he considered by the members of the court at the 
time of giving their decision. Vyasa 5 " 8 states 'the defects 
of the witnesses of a party should be pointed out by the opponent 
in open court by putting them down in writing and the wit- 
nesses should be called upon (by the judge) to refute them; 
if the witnesses admit (the faults pointed out) they do not 
deserve to be witnesses; if otherwise (if the faults are not 
admitted) they should be established by the opponent with 
evidence (other than those of other witnesses); for if the defects 
of the witnesses of a party were allowed to be established by 
other witnesses to be cited by the opponent, there would result 
the fault of a never-ending series (anavasllia), since the first party 
would then try to show defects in the latter set of witnesses 
and this may have to be carried on ad infinitum.' Br. laid down 
that an opponent should not be allowed to point out the grounds 
of incompetency in witnesses after they have begun to depose 
and Kat. adds 50 * that he (that party), who points out, after the 
witnesses have deposed to a matter, faults in them in whom he 
found none at first and who can not set out a proper reason 
(for his not proclaiming the faults at first) should be fined in

the first amercement. Br. further states ss that the defendant 
may point out the defects, if they exist, in the witnesses 
cited by the plaintiff; but if he finds faults which do not exist 
in the witnesses, he should be punished with a fine equal to the 
amount claimed (m monetary disputes) or equal to that which 
is levied from a false witness. If the witness of a party is not 
able to refute the defect pointed out by the opponent, the party 
calling him should try to clear his witness of the fault; other- 
wise he should not succeed in his suit 

When a witness is about* 06 to depose, he was, ace, to Br. 
(S B. E 33 p 302 v. 23), to put off his shoes and turban, raise 
his right hand (in order to draw the attention of the Court) and 
after touching gold, cowdung or darbha grasB was to depose to 
the truth S.p Dh S. II. 11 29. 7 says sw that a witness should 
depose to the truth on an auspicious day in the morning in thB 
presence of kindled fire and near (ajar of) water in the hall 
presided over by the king (or chief justice) and after being 
exhorted as regards both (viz. the results of truthfulness and 
falsehood) and when accepted by all (the court and parties) as 
a competent witness. Kaut also (in HL 11) says that wit- 
nesses should be examined in the presence of brahmanas, water- 
jar and fire. Manu (VBI 79-80) provides that the judge 
should in a conciliatory manner exhort all witnesses assemWefl 
inside the court in the presence of the plaintiff and defen- 
dant as follows: 'whatever acte of these two (litigants) between 
themselves you know as regards this matter (in dispute;, 
narrate them all truthfully, since you are the witnesses w ,»■

depose, in the presence of the parties and Gaut. XIB. Id ana

of the images of gods and brahmanas in the first half of the 
day and should he exhorted to tell the truth hy being hound 
with oaths. This examination in the public and after an oath 
went a long way in checking the tendency to depose falsely. 
The oath consisted of two parts, viz. (1) the requirement to tell 
the trath and (2) the exhortatory and imprecatory part. Both 
were administered hy the presiding judge. Gaut. (XHI. 12-13 ) 
appears to prescribe that an oath (iapatlia) was not to be 
administered to brahmana witness, but ManuVEL 113 ( = Nar. 
IV. 199) does not make this distinction. Gaut. ( XBX 14-23), 
Manu VUL 81-86, 89-101, Visnu Dh. S. VBX 24-37, Nar. IV. 
201-228 contain very long exhortations addressed by the judge to 
the witnesses relating to the importance and high worth of truth, 
stating how the conscience of a man pricks him, what rewards 
await the truthful witness here and in the next world and what 
sin and terrible torments in Hell are the lot of an untruthful 
witness, what evil befalls even the deceased ancestors of an 
untruthful witness and how he is liable to be punished by the 
king. They are too long to be cited here 509 . Shorter exhorta- 
tions ate found in Y&j. H. 73-75, Vas 16. 32-34, Baud. Dh. S I 
10. 19. 9-12 (S. B. E. vol. XIV p. 203 ), Br. ( S. B. K vol. 33 p. 301 
verses 19-22), Kat 343. Ear. IV. 200 provides 'let him (the 
judge ) inspire them ( the witnesses ) with awe by ( quoting ) 
ancient texts, extolling the greatness of truth and denouncing 
falsehood*. Kaut. (ffl. 11), Manu VBX 88 and 113 (=Uar IV 
199 ), Visnu Dh. S. VUL 20-23 add further modes of speech and 
exhortations according to the varm of the witness : A brahmana 
witness is to be addressed by the judge as ' speak' and to be 
exhorted to swear by his veracity, a ksatriya one was "to be 
addressed as ' speak the truth • and to be sworn by the animal 
he rides and his weapons ( which he.is to touch), a vaisya is 
to be sworn by his kine, grain and gold and a sudra is to be

is to be made to swear by his truth Some explain that the fiist 
rule applies to excellent brahmanas and the second to inferior 
ones and rely on Gaut ( XIII 12-13 ) who prescribes that an 
oath to speak the truth is not to be administered to brahmanas but 
only to others. Vide Haradatta on Gaut and Vivadacandra p 127

that the exhortation is not to depend purely on the caste but 
that brahmanas ( and others ) who tend kme, who engage in 
trade, who aro craftsmen or actors, who are menial servants and 
usurers should he treated (by the judge) as sudras 5U (in the matter 
of taking oaths) Witnesses after they are assembled before the 
Court are to be ordinarily examined separately (vide Kat 
quoted in n. 508 above) But Gaut XDL 5 and Kat 394 
provide s ' 2 that if a certain matter is seen by the witnesses as a 
body then they may he examined together. Manu VDI 78 and 
Kat 392 prescribe that what the witnesses declare quite natu- 
rally (without hesitation and fear) should betaken down and that 
when the witnesses have declared (what they know) they should 
not he questioned again and again by the king (or judge), from

HI] Cross examination 345 

it was the ohief judge or the judges who put questions and 
that there was no elaborate cross-examination and re-examina- 
tion of witnesses as in England ( which practice is followed in 
modern India ). The only cross examination that appears to 
have been allowed was about the faults or grounds .that made 
a person an incompetent witness. In this respect ancient Indian 
practice resembled modern judicial practice in some European sB 
countries other than England. Witnesses were compelled to 
attend. Kaut HL 11 states that witnesses who are not far 
removed by time or space should be produced by the parties 
themselves, but those who are far away or who are unwilling 
to stir shall be got summoned by order of the king 514 . Manu 
Vm. 107, Yaj. H. 77, Br., Kat and Visnu Dh. S. Vm. 37 say that 
if a witness knowing all facts and not prevented from coming 
by disease or similar causes refuses to come as a witness he 
incurs the sin of false witness, has to pay the amount in dispute 
and ten per cent thereof as fine to the king. This is in accor- 
dance with the principle enforced in modern times that it is the 
duty of a citizen to appear before a court of justice when 
summoned. Kaut (m 1) provides for subsistence allowance 
to witnesses. It is not quite dear whether parties could be 
regarded under ancient Hindu Law as competent witnesses on 
their own behalf. Yaj (IL 13-15) appears to suggest that 
parties could be regarded as witnesses in their own cause and 
held to be false from their demeanour as in the case of witnesses.

IV. 5. 184 defines B&ksl in such a way as to exclude the litigant 
himself. Ordinarily witnesses were examined in the open 
court in tho presence of the parties and never behind their back, 
but Kfit ( 387-389 ) prescribes that in the case of immovable 
proporty oral ovidonce may bo taken on the property itself and 
in pome cases even elsewhere than these two (viz the Court and 
immovable proporty ), that is, in the case of the death of living 
livings witnesses may be made to depose before the corpse (of 
On 1 uniinnl killed ) or, in the absence of the body, before 51 ' some 
mark ( mjcIi as the horn of an animal ) Br. and Manu VJIL 25

VIJ1. 18, Yaj. 11 13-15 and Kat 386 point out the actions and 
appearances of a party or wiluesb that deposes falsely, viz he 
appears, restless, changes his place (i e moves from one spot 
to another ), licks tho corners, of his lipi, his forehead perspires, 
bis face loses colour, he frequently coughs and heaves freqaent 
sight., he scratches the ground with Jiib feet (toes), waves hu. 
bands and garment, his mouth becomes dry and his voice 
tallow, he speaks incoherently, talks too much though not 
asked and does not reply straight to the questions asked and 
avoids meeting the eyes of the questioner Such a witness may 
be looked upon as untrue and the king or judge shmild bring 
him under discipline ( so that he will be afraid to lie ) Merely 
on seeing these signs a witness was not to be punished or 
entiiely disbelieved, since these signs raise only a probability oi

Ill J Conflict of oral evidence 347 

When there are many witnesses but they differ in their 
statements certain rules axe laid down by Manu VIII. 73 
(=Visnu Dh S. VUX 39 ), Yu E. 78, Nar. IV. 339, Br. ( S. B. E. 
vol. 33 p 303 v. 35 ), Kat. { 408 } They are briefly theBe : *> The 
statement of the majority of witnesses should be accepted, but 
if they are egually divided then the statement of those who are 
more pure { in character or more disinterested ) should be accepted 
and if the meritorious are divided equally then those who are the 
best among them should be accepted as true. The Mit on Yaj. 
IL 78 adds that if there is a conflict of testimony between the 
statements of a few but eminently qualified witnesses on the 
one hand and those of a larger number of ordinary witnesses, 
then the former should be accepted as Yaj II. 72 requires i. e 
it prefers quality to mere numbers. Kaut. HL 11 prescribes 
that when there is conflict in the oral evidence the decision 
should be according to the evidence of the majority of witnesses 
or of those who are pure in character or of thobe who are 
approved of by both sides as good witnesses or a mean should 
be drawn from their statements. Nar. IV 160 and Kat. 359 
state 58 that if one out of the ( three ) witnesses attesting a docu- 
ment or out of ( three ) witnesses that aTC cited by a party deposes 
in a way contradictory to what is deposed to by the other two, 
then all the three become incompetent witnesses on account of 
contradiction This has been interpreted by the Vyavahara 
mttrka (p. 336 ) to mean that where all witnesses are of equal 
status and there is a majority of onLy one favouring one side, 
then ail the witnesses are incompetent and oral evidence is in 
that case futile for decision. 

The important question is how much has to be proved by 
the party calling witnesses Yaj. H, 79 (= Visnu Dh S VU 38) 
Nar IL 27 and Br ( q by Sm <3. IL 91 ) state the general 'rule 
that that party whose averments aTe supported in their entirety 
as true by tiie witnesses becomes successful, while that litigant.

that where the depositions of witnesses are in conflict as to the 
place, the time, the property, the amount, the colour, the species

523 . The maxim (in Yaj. n 20) that on proof a part of a claim the whoft 
may be held to be proved (vide above n 431 ) applies only where the opponent 
totally denies every item of the claim of the plaintiff. This is a presumption 
and the king or judge is not to be blamed for acting upon it is ease of tots)

Mi( onYaj II 20) 'in claims containing several items, the creditor (or 
plaintiff) secures a decree for as much out of them as he is able to establish 
by means of witnesses '. These two verses are sought to be reconciled ibi 
various ways by the Mit (on Yaj 11.20), the Sm. C H pp. 1Z0-121 
Vyavahara-matrka pp.310-312 (where it criticizes the views of Yogfoka), V P. 
pp. 98-102. It is impossible for -want of space to go into these interpretat-

made in the plaint ( such aB the time, place, number &c. ) and 
the case made out in the depositions as to any of these essential 
particulars "will have the same consequence as tendering no oral 
evidence. This rule was not followed to the letter and besides 
other means of proof could be resorted to, as stated by the Mit., 
the Vivadacandra and otheiB S2S . Kaut. HL ll 526 states that 
when the witnesses depose to less than what is averred in the 
plaint, the plaintiff has to pay a fine (of a fifth part) on the 
excess and when they depose to more than the claim, the excess 
(held proved on the depositions ) may be taken by the king. 

In charges of adultery, heinous crimes {sahasa) and theft 
the whole of the matter that is alleged may be held proved, 
■when witnesses depose to only a part of the matter ^ (sayB 
Eat. 397). 

Mrada IV. 165 prescribes that a litigant SM should not secret- 
ly approach a witness cited by his opponent, nor should he try to 
win him over (by bribes or threats) through another; if he does 
so, he would suffer the consequences of a losing party ( Mrta ). 

There were rules about the late production of evidence. It 
has been already shown how if a litigant adduces weak evidence, 
though strong evidence is available, he would not be allowed 
to rely on the latter after judgment is pronounced. It is said 
by Kar. I 63 that when a law-suit has proceeded faT enough 
(lit. has been cleansed or thrashed out), evidence sudh as a

document or witnesses, would then become useless if th„t 
evidence had not been announced before^ " a7£T Jlf 
filed V the defendant, the plaintiff has to shea I J ofh ? 
evidence i e documents or witnesses (Ya, V™ Theme— 
briefly is as follows: If he does not do so, pr ceeds "he 
trial and does not call all necessary witnesses or produce a] 
documents and the case is almost fimshed, but judgment is not 
pronounced, even then he would not be allowed to produce fresh 
evidence at that late stage For if fresh evidence not previously 
disclosed were allowed to be given at that late stage, it would 
cause surprise to the defendant, who would then demand time 
for adducing evidence in rebuttal and then the plaintiff may 
again cite further evidence and this process is in danger of being 
carried on ad mfindum. If however witnesses were already cited 
but all were not examined ( e g. if ten witnesses were mentioned 
and only three examined) and the plaintiff found that the evidonce 
of the few witnesses examined for him is contradictory or hostile, 
then he may be allowed to produce even at a late stage the 
remaining witnesses ( who may be seven i e. double the number 
of those already examined or who may be more respectable or 
purer in character ). This proposition is contained in Yaj II 80 
on which the Mitaksara remarks that even if witnesses are not 
mentioned in a list, but before judgment is pronounced other 
more reliable or respectable witnesses or double in number 
( and of the same status as ) of those examined are available, 
they should be examined by the court even at a late stage Thfl 
rule is that as long as witnesses are available resort to ordeals 
should not be had Yaj. IT 80 also has given rise to various 
interpretations Vide Mit and Apararka on Yaj II 80, Sm C 
IL p 94, V. P p. 130-134 The Mit thinks that the veree 
applies where the plaintiff or the party on whom lies the burden 
of proving a positive proposition finds that the witnesses pro- 
duced by him are hostile or contradictory and that in such a 
case he may be allowed to cite other more respectable or more 
numerous witnesses to prove his proposition and to show that 
the first set of witnesses is false, whilo Apararka holds that

case cites witnesses which the opponent feels are false, the 
opponent may produce more respectable or more numerous 
Xesses to depose to the contrary and he would toe prove 
the tost set to be false Apar&rka relies on Kat. (408) for thw 
propositions - It may be said that Apar&rka's interrelation 
appears more natural. V. P. K p 134 ) accepts Kfityayana but 
says that the interpretation of the Mit. ( of Ysj. D. 80 ) is 
correct. Whatever view is accepted it leads to this that one 
set of witnesses uot only may prove the truth of a party s 
case but also establish that another set of that party's witnesses 
are guilty of perjUTy. 

Yaj. II. 82 provides that if a witness, having promised with 
other witnesses to depose to a state of things, denies at the time 
of his examination that he saw the matter in dispute.heshould be 
fined eight times the amount that a defeated litigant would have 
to pay and a hrahmana witness similarly guilty if unable to 
pay may be banished (or his house Bbould be raaedtothe 
ground). Nar. IV. 197 says that such a person is worse than a 
false witness Manu YDI. 107, Yaj U. 76, andK&t. (405) pres- 
cribe that if a person who has witnessed a transaction does not 
depose (i. e. remains silent) about it, though not suffering from 
disease or some other calamity, he should be made (after 
waiting for three fortnights) to pay the amount of the debt or 
other matter in dispute and also one-tenth thereof as fine to 
the king. 

After the witnesses have deposed the chief justice and 
sabbyas have to consider the depositions of witnesses (as Xat. 
340 provides) 531 The Court has to find out which set of wit- 
nesses are to be believed and what witnesses are perjured. 
Perjury entailed, according to dharmasastra works, both secular 
and other-worldly consequences. Ap. Dh. S. (H 11. 29. 8-9) states : 
'"When a witness deposes falsely the king should fine him and, 
in addition, the witness incurs hell after death' andGaut. 
provides (XDI. 7 and 23 ), 'a witness telling the truth goes to 
heaven, but falls into hell if he does the reverse and when he 
deposes falsely he is to be censured and fined'. Manu Vm. 
118 states that witnesses depose falsely through covetousness,

wrong ideas, fear, friendship, sexual passion, wrath, ignorance 
and minority and prescribes (VUL 120-132) varying fines for 
perjury arising from these several causes. Br. (S. B. E. vol 33 
p. 301 r. 21) regards 532 a corrupt judge, a perjured witneBB and 
the murderer of a brahmana as equally sinful. Taj. H. 81 and 
Kat. (407) prescribe ss that the litigant who procures perjured 
evidence and the witnesses guilty of perjury should each be 
separately fined double the amount of the fine prescribed for 
defeat in various disputes and a brahmana (guilty of doing the 
same) should be banished from the country 53 * (but not fined). 
But when a person (of any of the three castes other than brah- 
mana) is frequently guilty of perjury he should be fined and 
given physical punishment (as cutting the tongue or death) 
and a similarly guilty brahmana should be fined and banished 
(or degraded by being carried naked through the streets or 
deprived of his house ) The Mit. on Yaj. JX 81 says that when 
Manu prescribes (VUL 380) that a brahmana guilty of a sin is 
not to be awarded death or corporal punishment and that he is to 
be banished with all his wealth, he refers to the brahmana being 
a first offender and not a confirmed one. Manu VBX 108 says 
'where within seven days from deposing in acaUBea(serioos 
or painful) disease or fire or the death of a relative befalls a 
witness, he should be (being held as a false witness owing to 
these portentous happenings ) made to pay the debt in dispute to 
the opposite side and a fine to the king ' The Sm. C (H. p 94) 
explains that this applies to a witness who is the only one on a 
disputed matter such as a messenger and the king or judge 
should wait for seven days to see whether any of these odan "*|jjj? 
befalls that witness and then hold him to be perjured. Eat. (410) 
contains 535 a similar rule, but he states that the king shoulfl 
wait one, two or three weeks or up to 45 days according to the 
value of the matter in dispute and the caste of the deponent

whatever lawsuit it is established that witnesses perjured 
themselves, the judge should hear it again (from the beginning) 
or if the suit has ended he should set aside the decision and 
examine it again. 

Gaut 13 24-25, Vas 16. 36, Manu VHL 104, Y&j. XL 83, 
Visnu Dh. S. VHL 15 prescribe that a witness may depose falsely 
in a cause when, if he were to speak the truth, a person of tue 
four varnas is liable to suffer the sentence of death. Manu 
VDL 105-106, Yaj II. 83, Yisnu Dh S. VllI 16 prescribe that 
as a penance for the falsehood a witness of the three higher 
castes may offer three oblations o f boiled rice to the goddess of 
speech (SarasvatI) or he may offer into fire clarified butter 
with the mantras called Kusmanda ( Vaj. S. XX. 14~lb or Tai 
A. X. 3-5), or with the three verses beginning with 'yaddeva 
devahedanam' or with the verse sacred to Varuna (viz Rg. L» 
24 15, 'uduttamam varuna') or with three verses of which 
waters ' are the deity ( £g. X 9. 1-3 ' apo hi siha ) '. Visnu Dh S. 
VHL 1? adds that a sudra guilty of perjury in the above 
case may by way of expiation feed ten cows for one day. 
It is strange that the dharmasastra works should permit 
perjury to save a "culprit from being sentenced to death. 
Probably popular sentiment of old standing allowing the speak- 
ing of falsehood in certain cases was responsible for this In 
the MahabhSrata frequent reference is made to the permission 
to speak untruth in ordinary life when one's own life or 
another's life is in imminent danger Vide Sam** 3 * 45 35 
109.19. ItisstatedinSanti 165. 30 that speaking falsely is

wealth and tor one's life V as . 16. 36 mentions those five 
occasions somewhat differently. Vide Manu VDX 112 also for a 
similar rule. But so old a sage as Gaut (23 29) implies that 
he disapproves of this sentiment** when he states, 'according 
to some falsehood entails no fault (i. e. no expiation need be 
performed) m (bringing about or breaking promises made at)

Ear. (IV. 235-236) states that when through 535 the care- 
lessness of the creditor ( who dies ) there is no document nor 
witness to prove a debt and the defendant denies it, then one 
of three methods (of proof) may be resorted to, viz. codana 
ptah/calam ( dunning the debtor each time to repay ), yuktdeka 
(putting forth arguments) and iapatha (special oaths and 
• ordeals J 538 ". Eat. ( 233 q. by Sm C. IL p 52 and Par M. IE 91 ) 
has a similar verse Vulch according to Narada IV. 238 means 539 
' tbe,creditor should follow ( the debtor ) by arguments and by 
himself remembering and by reminding the debtor of the time, 
the place, the relation ( subsisting between the two)' Othere 
-interpret yukU differently, that is, it means " logical reasoning'

HI] Circumstantial evidence 355 

It is stated by Brhaspati that anvrriana (inference 541 oi pre- 
sumption ), as a means of deciding a law suit, is of three kinds, 
but it is inferior to witnesses ( vide note 433 above ). Vyasa 
( q. by Sm. C. II. p. 95 ) .states that amartuna is the same as 
helu. and tnrlca V. P. (p 167) remarks that (long continued) 
possession and the frequent urging by the creditor both lead to 
the inference of title and the taking of a loan respectively and 
are therefore to be comprehended under ijukh according to the 
definition of Katyayana Yet by popular usage yukli is res- 
tricted to presumptions arising from certain circumstances on 
the analogy of the maxim of ' gobalivarda ' explained below 
under ' steya ' Yukti therefore means circumstantial evidence 
from which an inference may be drawn about a fact in issue in 
a judical poceeding. Ap. Dh. 542 S. IL 11.29 6 says that in 
case of doubt (judges) should decide from signs (i. e by 
inference) or divine proof (ordeals). Vas. 19. 39 mentions 
the view of some sages that one who is found armed or wounded 
or in possession of the booty ( stolen ) may be declared to be ( the 
thief or offender ). Manu IX. 270 (=Matsya 227. 166 ) requires 
the just king not to condemn to death one accused of theft 
unless his guilt is proved as certain by proof that the accused 
had in his possession the articles stolen and tools for theft ( for 
house-breaking). ' An adulterer is proved 5 * to be so by being 
caught in such acts as playing with the hair of another's wife, an 
incendiary by being caught with a firebrand in his hand ( near 
the house set on fire ), a murderer by being found ( near the 
murdered man) armed and a thief when caught with some of 
the articles stolen in his possession '—say Sankba-Likhita 5 * 4

HI] Dangers of circumstantial, evidence 357 

Judges often repeat from the Bench, the words ' witnesses 
may lie, but circumstances cannot'. But this so-called maxim is 
often dangerous. Circumstantial evidence leads to conclusions 
that are in several instances false. The ancient Hindu lawyers 
were quite aware of the dangers of drawing inferences from 
circumstantial evidence. Narada's warning has already been 
mentioned (p. 356 ). Eaut. sss ( in IV 8 ) remarks : ' even one not 
a thief may by chance be on the way by which thieves pass and 
one meeting thieves is seen to be apprehended as a thief because 
he is mixed up in dress, arms and articles carried with the 
thieves or is found near the articles stolen, just as Mandavya 
though not a thief declared himself to be a thief for fear of 
being subjected to torture ; therefore ( the king } should punish 
one only after thorough examination ' Mandayya's is a leading 
case on the danger of relying on purely circumstantial evidence. 
Brhaspati 519 also remarks that ' a decision should not be arrived 
at merely by relying on the words of texts ; for, if judges come to 
a conclusion without applying careful reasoning, loss of dharma 
results ; a thief is held to be not a thief and a good man is held 
to be a wicked one in a judical proceeding ( not arrived at with 
proper reasoning). The sage Mandavya was held to be a 
thief on account of the decision being arrived at without 
proper reasoning " ssa . 

The 9th Act of the Mrcchakatika is a standing Wanav 
condemnation of conclusions about guilt drawn from circuni- 1 
stantial evidence and of bow judicial procedure is vitiated 
( of vyavahara-dustata, as the author says in Act I )

ordeals" 1 and various sapathas' Ace. to the Mit. (onYaj 
H. 96) and S V (p. 106) both special oaths and ordeals are 
divine proof (divyapramana), but in disputes of small value 
sapathas ( oaths) were generally employed, while ordeals were 
resorted to only in serious disputes or crimes The Mit { on Yaj- 
H 96), the V May.p 46 and V p (p 170) state that ordeals 
are those that generally end in immediate decision of the 
dispute, while sapathas take time for decision ( because after 
the oath the king has to wait for a week or more to see whether 
a calamity befalls the person taking the special oath) Vyasa 
quoted by Sm IL p. 96 employs the word iapathas for both 
special oaths (taken as to one's 'satya') and ordeals like 
balance. Sankha-Likhita state that divine proofs are the balance, 
eating poison, entering fire, holding a piece of (hot) iron, 
offering one's merit acquired by sacrifices arid charity and the 
king should make him undergo other sapathas 5Si . Brhaspati 
says that where documents or witnesses do not lead to a certain 
decision or where inference from circumstantial evidence also is 
confusing, there the matter is to be decided by divine proof 5 * 

Special oaths were taken not only in judicial proceedings, 
but also in ordinary dealings to clinch one's assertion or to 
clear one's character or reputation Nar (IV. 243-244) refers to

Manu VUL 110 also speaks of the iapallia taken by Vasistha 
before SudEs, son of Pijavana ( when the sage was charged by 
Visvamitra with the offence of devouring his own hundred sons). 
Narada (IV. 243) refers to Bg. VEL 104 15-16 in the first of which

I am a yatudkam or if I injured the life of a human being ,

hymn sss . Manu VUL 113 (=Nar. IV. 199) referred to above (p 343) 
states the various oaths to be taken or administered to the parties 
according to their respective castes. Manu VUL 114 further pro- 
vides for special oaths for litigants by touching the heads of their 
sons and wives. That sapatha taken by sat ya was common in very 
ancient times appears from Pan. V 4 66 ( satjiad-asapaike ). S5?

Dh. S. ( IX 5-10 ) prescribes that when the litigant is a siidra 
and the dispute relates to a matter worth less than one, two, 
three, four or five hrsnalas he should swear respectively by 
h&lding in his hand duriJa grass, sesame, silver, gold or earth 
taken from ploughed land, that ( IX 11-12 ) beyond that value 
\ arious ordeals may he offered and that oaths with similar objects 
in the hands may be offered to vaisyas, ksatnyas andbrahmanas 
when the value of the subject matter is double, three times or 
tour times of the value in the case of a sudra Manu VUL 111 
gives the admonition that a wise man should not make a false 
oath, because by so doing he incurs loss ( of reputation ) here 
and after death ( by falling into Hell ) Yaj II 236 prescribes 
a fine of 100 pan/is far one who takes an improper or profane

CHAPTER XIV 
ORDEALS 

A brief history of ordeals may be set out here. Bg. 
I. 158. 4-5, -wherein 561 the sage Dirghatamas, son of Ucatha, 
prays that the fire of faggots heaped tenfold may not bum him 
and that the rivers in which he was thrown bound hand and foot 
may not engulf him, are regarded by some as a reference to the 
ordeal of fire and water Yet in those -verses there is probably no 
reference to ordeals, but to the cruel treatment of Dirghatamas 
by rfasas headed by Traitana ]Rg, IIL 53. 22 also, where it 5 * 2 
is said ' he heats the axe ( or aoc to Sayaua ' just as the tree 
is- injured by contact with tue axe &c ' ) ', does not contain a clear 
or certain reference to the ordeal of holding the heated axe 
Atharvaveda 563 1L 1% is held by several Western scholars to 
contain a reference to the fire ordeal. This also is far from 
certain, though verse 8 may lend some support to that view s « 
The Paficavimsa ( or Tandya ) Brahmana 14. 6. 6 refers S6S to the 
story of Vatsa, who was abused by his step-brother that the former 
was the son of asudrawoman, against which Vatsa protested 
urged feat he was a brahmana, entered fire to prove the 
truth of his assertion and came out of fire unscathed. This 
is referred to by Manu VIII, 116. Thi s is probably the earliest

five kinds of ordeals. Yaj H 95, Visnu Dh. S, IX-2IV and 

Nar. IV. 25a mention five viz. balance, Are, water, poison and 

koia (consecrated water). Narada, however, knew two more 

Viz. taptamasa (IV. 343 ) and taydula (IV. 337 ). Brhaspati (S.B E.

vogue in the early centuries of the Christian era is shown by 
the Mrcehakaiika Act IX. 43 (where the ordeals of poison, 
water, balance and fire are expressly named ) and by Bana who 
mentions the same four in Kadambarl, para 47 S6S . Among the 
digests and commentaries the Mitaksara, the Smrtloandrika, the 
Divyatattva of Raghunandana, the Vyavah&ramayukha and 
the Vyavaharaprakasa contain the most elaborate treatment of 
ordeals 569

jjj-j Use of ortieai- 363 

■ Dioya is defined as ' that which decides a matter (™ dispute) 
"not determined^ human means of proof ' (V. MeyuKha , opI* 
w hicb decides what cannot he or is not to be decided by hum,- 
meansof proof (Divyatattva*°p.5U) Medhat^onMan 
Vffl 116 discusses the question ho%v ordeals can he relied upon 
for the discovery of truth The objection is raised that are 
and water are natural forces that act in a uniform way and 
are not intelligent beings which may change their minds 
by an appeal to them. Therefore, the objector says, ordeals 
and oaths are like magic and are only meant to frighten the 
parties into telling the truth It is further objected that thieves, 
may (by some trick) not he burnt in the fire ordeal and good 
men are seen to suffer burns. The reply is: the usefulness of 
ordeals cannot he negatived by these examples of failures, w- 
they are not frequent and as even direct perception and in- 
ference sometimes lead to uncertain results No one, however, 
says that these latter should not be relied upon. Just as one 
relies on witnesses in deciding a matter (who may for aught 
one knows be telling lies }, so reliance can be placed on ordeals. 
Where there is failure in case of ordeals, it must be held to be 
due to the results of the performer's actions in past lives. The 
general rule as stated by Yaj IL 22, Har. H 29, IV. 239, Brhas- 
pati 571 , Kat ( 217 } and Pitamaha is that ordeals were to be 
resorted to only if no human evidence ( witnesses, documents, 
possession) or circumstantial evidence was available Eat 
(218-219) prescribes that 572 if one party relies on human means 
of proof and the other on divine proof, the king ( or judge ) is 
to accept human means and not divine and that if human 
means of proof reach ( i e. are able to establish ) only a part 
of the allegations ( in the plaint ), then human means should 
be accepted and no divine modes of proof, even though they 
may be complete ( i.e completely cover all allegations ) "When 
Bar. II 30 ( = IV", 241 ) states that divine meanB of proof are 
to be resorted to when a transaction takes place in a forest, in

a lonely place, at night, inside a house, in cases of suhasa and 
when a deposit is denied, or when Kat ( 230 ) prescribes that 
trial by ordeals is to be resorted to in the case of persons accus- 
ed of committing suhasa in secret (i.e. by wearing masks &o. ), az 
those words only apply where it ib impossible to have 
human evidence. K&t. ( 229 ) states an exception to this viz. 
when the dispute 57 * investigated is about suhasa or alout 
assault or abuse and defamation and in causes that spring from 
the use of force there is an option that witnesses or divine 
proof may be resorted to. Nar. IV. 242 states that divine proof 
could be resorted to when the chastity of women was in question, 
in v theft and suhasa and in all cases of the denial of monetary 
liability. Slta's ordeal cf fire at once comes to mind as an 
illustration of Narada's rule. Brhaspati S7S and Pit&maha say 
that in disputes about immoveable property divine proof should 
be avoided, which does not forbid divya altogether, but only 
where the evidence of neighbours or of a document is available 
and that in the latter case even if the defendant offers to pay a 
fine if he fails by the divine proof, dhya is not to he resorted 
to. The ordinary rule was that ordeals were to he administered 
to the defendant 5 " (Kat. 411=Visnu Dh. S. IX 21 X But 
Yfi] 1L 96 gives an option that any one of the two litigants 
may by mutual agreement undergo an ordeal and the other 
should agree to pay on defeat a fine or undergo physical 
punishment This means that human proof is adduced to

TTT ) Employment of the several ordeals 365 

(in Ysj. 95, Visnu Eh, S IX. 20,22,Pitamaba,Uar W.257, 
Kat. 412-413) Ya.3. II 95 prescribes that the ordeals of 
balance, fire, poison and water were to be prescribed in 
disputes of great value and not elsewhere and in 1L 99 he says 
that all claims above 1000 panas ( of copper ) are to be regarded 
as of great value, but in charges of treason and of the commit- 
ting of any one of the five grave sins [maJwpulaJcas) any one 
of these four ordeals may be resorted to without regard to 
value and without any offer to pay fine on defeat. So also 
these four ordeals were to be offered to the defendant where 
the plaintiff offered to pay a fine on defeat. The ordeal of 
koia was allowed in all claims whether of high value or low 
value or whether the plaintiff offered to pay a fine on 
defeat or not. 

Yaj. n. 98 states that the ordeal of balance should be given 
to women, a minor (under 16 ), a very old person ( above eighty 
years), the blind, the cripple, brahmanas and the diseased ; the 
fire ordeal (i. e. heated ploughshare and heated masa) to 
ksatriyas, water ordeal to vaisyas, poison to sudras. Nar. IV. 
335 assigns ordeals to the different varnas similarly. Kar IV. 
256 prescribes that ordeals should not be undergone by those 
who are observing a vow, who are much distressed or who are 
performing austerities, and by women Pitemaha quoted by 

mu fc 'J° n P* ^ 98) adds ininors and old pawonB to these. 
TheSm.C.H p. 103 explains this as referring to the ordeals 
of fire, poison and water only. Another Smrti (q. by Mit on 
Ysj. 2L 98) prescribes that the ordeals of balance and ko&amay be 
offered to women, minors and the others mentioned above. There 
a m all these rules a spirit of tolerance, kindness and concern 
forthe weaknesses of mankind. Kat (423) holds "Hhat persons 
of the higher castes who are cowherds, traders, artisans, bards, 
domestic servants and usurers should be given ordeals as if 
they were sudras. Kat (422) allows all ordeals to members 
of all castes, except that brahmanas are not to undergo fee

of) bile or phlegm, nor koia to those who are drunkards, to 
persons fond of women, to gamblers and to those who are 
atheists. Visnu Dh. S. IX. 25, 29 and War IV. 255, 332 contain 
similar provisions Eat (427-430) further provides that no 
ordeal should be allowed to be performed personally by thu 
following persons, viz. those charged with the murder of their 
father, mother, a brahmana, their teacher, a minor, a woman 
and the king; those guilty of the (five) grave sins; particularly 
those that are atheists; those who wear (or subsist by) 
peculiar sect marks; great rogues; those who are experts in 
incantations and yoga practices ; those who are the progeny ol 
unions of persons of different varnas'; those who repeatedly 
engage in sin; in the case of these the king should offer ordeals 
to good men appointed by them on their behalf and if such 
good men are not willing then they should appoint then- own 
relatives. Sankha-Likhita also refer to the appointment of 
friends or relatives as representatives (Apararka p. Mi)* 1 * 
Kat (433) 580 lays down the following rather remarkable pro- 
vision, viz when untouchables, men of lowest castes, slaves, 
mlecclias and those born of mixed unions in the reverse order 
of the castes are guilty of crimes, the determination of their 
guilt (by the above mentioned ordeals) should not be made by 
the king; he should indicate such' ordeals as are in vogue 
among them. TheSm. and 'Par M say that this applies

The VyavahaTatattva (p. 579 ) explains that the ordeals referred 
to among mlecchas and others are the snake in the jar and the 
like. This seems to have consisted in taking out a ring or 
coin with the hand from a jar in which a snake was placed ; if 
there was no snake-bite or no effect even if the 1 snake bit, 
the parson was declared innocent. Vide note 580. Yaj. II. 
97 and NaT. IV. 268, 320 prescribe that all ordeals are to be 
administered by the chief justice in the morning aj; sunrise or 
in the forenoon in the presence of the king, the Babhyas and 
brahmanas. The Mit. adds that a Sunday is the proper day 
according to the usage of respectable people ( iistas ). Pitamaha 
specially provides that the water ordeal should be administered 
in the noon and poison in the last watch of the night (Mit. on 
Yaj. H. 97 ). Certain seasons and months were either appro- 
priate or inappropriate to certain ordeals e. g. Nar. IV. 254 
Btates that the fire ordeal should be given in the rainy season, 
balanoe in the winter ( sisira), water in summer, poison when 
the season is cool Ear. IV". 259 prohibits water ordeal in the 
cold season, fire in summer, poison in the rainy season and 
balance while the wind blows violently. The Mit. (on Yaj. 
IL 97 ) and Par. M. UL 162 quote Pitamaha to the effect that the 
months of Oaitra, Vaisakha and Margaslrsa are common to all 
ordeals, koia and balance may be administered in all months. 

As regards the place, Pitamaha prescribes that ordeals are 
to be administered by the king or the judge appointed by the 
king in the presence of learned brahmanas and the public ( or 
the ministers ) S81 . Kat. ( 434-35 and 437 ) provides : S82 ' ordeals 
should be administered in some well-known temple in the case 
of men accused of grave sins and near the royal gate in the case

The procedure common to all ordeals and described in the 
Hit on Yaj II 97 and 99, the V May pp 52-55, VP.pp 183-186 
(all relying on Pitamaha) and Vyavahara-nirnaya pp 148-53 
( relying on Prajapati, PitSmaha, Br ) is briefly as follows —In 
ordeals the chief justice is to do every thing at the king's 
bidding as the adhvuryu priest does in all sacrifices He should 
observe a fast and the sodhya ( person undergoing the ordeal 
to clear himself } is also to do the same. Both are to bathe in 
the morning and the sodhya was to have his wet clothes on. 
The Chief Judge is to invoke the gods to the accompaniment of 
music and to offer flowers, sandal-wood paste and incense He 
should fold his hands, face the east and invoke Dharma to be 
present at the ordeal (Dharma being the principal deity in 
ordeals ) and assign places to Indra, Yama, Varuna and Eubera 
in the four principal quarters from the east and to Agm and 
other guardians of quarters in the corners of the principal 
quarters. He is to contemplate on the eight deities of the eight 
quarters as having different colours (viz Indra as yellow, 
Yama as dark &c. } He is to assign the eight Vasus (repeat- 
ing their names ) to the south of Indra, the twelve Adityas 
(xepaating, their names) between Indra and Isana (i. e, 
between east and north-east), assign a place to the eleven 
Eudras to the west of Agni, assign a place to the seven Mother 
goddesses between Yama and Hirrti ( between south and south- 
west), assign a place to GanesatothenorthofNirrti.totbe 
Maruts (seven) to the north of Varuna; to the north of the 
balance '(or the place of other' 'ordeals ) he should invoke 
Durga. All these deities are to be invoked with appropriate 
Vedic mantras (set out in V.May.) He should offer the 
several items of worship from arghya ( water offered by way oi 
honour) to ornament to Dharma (as the principal deity J a™ 
then to the subsidiary deities from Indra to DurgS («««*"« 
to appropriateness ) and then sandalwood paste, f ™ re -*f ^ 
lamp and imvedya to the deities from Dharma to Durga l»

flowers for Dhamia are to ba red. Up to this is the work of the 
Chief Justice. Sacrificial priests should offer into fire in the 
four quarters 108 oblations of clarified butter, boiled rice and 
fuel sticks with syllable Om and the Gayati i and with ' Om ' 
and ' soSM' at the end of each. Having written down on a 
leaf the subject matter for which the party is undergoing ordeal 
the leaf should be placed on the head of the sodhya with the 
mcntfro, 583 'the sun, the moon, the wind, fire, heaven and 
earth, waters, the heart, Yama, day and night, the two twi- 
lights and Dharma know { see or mark ) the deeds of men *. 

The several ordeals will now be briefly described. 

ITirst comes tula or dltala (balanoe) A sacrificial tree 
(such as ktodvra or udumbara ) should be cut to the accompani- 
ment of vedic mantras ( employed in making a sacrificial post). 
Two wooden posts made of that tree should support a trans- 
verse beam ( called alcsa ). The posts should be fixed in the 
ground, the part above ground being four cubits and that below 
being two cubits. This frame should face the east ( i. e. the 
posts must be in the south and north ). Then the beam of the 
balance was to be made from the same tree and was to be 
suspended from the transverse beam of the frame by means of a 
hook. Three iron rings were to be fastened to the beam . of the 
balance, two at the end and one in the middle for suspending 
the balance from the transverse beam by means of a chain or 
string. Two scales were to be suspended at the two ends of 
the beam by hooks and strings from the iron rings fixed at the 
ends of the beam On the two sides of the balance there should 
be two arches in which the scales should move and which 
should be ten angulas higher than the balance. There should 
be two perpendicular pendants made of clay hanging down 
from the arches and touching the upper surface of the balance 
In the pan to the west the sodhya should be placed and weighed 
against clay, bricks and stones placed in the other pan. Then 
teaders or goldsmiths or brariers should examine the balance 
and bring at on a level with the two pendants hanging doSS 
from the arches and examine the perfect tataSg S7u

beam of the balance by spilling a little water on the beam. 
When the parson sitting in one pan is equal in weight to the 
materials ( clay &c ) in the other, a line should be drawn with 
chalk by the experts on the arch ( to show the exact position 
of the pans ). Then the man is made to get down from the 
pan and he is to invoke the balance as stated in Yaj. IL I01-102i 
'O balance, you are the abode of truth, you were created by the 
gods for this purpose, declare the truth, free me from this 
(cloud of) suspicion. Mother! if I am a sinner then take me 
lower, if I am pure take me upwards'. The parson is then to 
hear exhortations about the result of untruth after putting the 
writing on his head (vide Nar. IV. 376 and Visnu Dh. S. X. 9), 
then he is again to be placed in the pan to the "accompaniment 
of invocations (War. IV. 278-279, Visnu Dh. S. X 10-11). A 
worthy brahmana learned in astronomy is to calculate the 
time of five palas S84 or vmafis Then his weight is again to 
be marked. If the person goes up (i. e is found lighter than 
what he formerly weighed) he is declared innocent ( aco. to the 
com. on Nar. IV. 283, V. Mayiikha p. 60, DipakalikS onYaj 
EL 102 ); if he weighs the same or goes down ( i. e. weighs more) 
he is guilty. Then the person concerned is to distribute gifts 
to the judge, the brahmanas and sacrificial priests and take 
leave of the deities invoked Brhaspati (SBE vol. 33 p sa 
v. 19) states that he who weighs the same should be weigh** 
once more. If the pan or the beam or the hooks break or the 
ropes give way owing to some visible cause then the procedure 
STto be repeated, but if the breaking is due to an unseen 
cause or accident, the person was to be declared gnflly. 

The ordeal of fire is as follows .-Nine circles ' *£* "-JJ

angulas in length, till it becomes red-hot and emits sparks. 
Then all the details described above ending with the placing 
of the writing on the head of the sodhya are to be gone through 
by the judge and the fire ( in the red-hot piece ) is to be invoked 
with several mantras ( such as Yaj. IL 104 SB6 and Visnu Dh. S. 
XL 11-12 ). The sodhya should stand in the first circle facing 
the east. Having made red marks on all sores of the hands of 
the Sodhya on which grains of rice have been rubbed, he ( the 
judge ) should place seven leaves of the asvattha tree on them 
and also grains of rice and curds and should fasten round them 
threads Then the judge should carry the red-hot iron piece by 
means of a pair of tongs and place it in the hands of the sodhya 
(that are covered with leaves). Then the sodhya holding in 
both his hands the red-hot piece should walk from the first to 
the eighth circle not hurriedly but slowly and at ease. Having 
reached the 8th SS7 circle he should throw the red-hot iron piece 
on to the 9th circle. Then the judge should rub on the hands of 
the sodhya rice grains and when the latter shows no hesitation 
at the rubbing and no injury on his hand at the end of the day 
he is declared to be innocent. Kat, (441) and Yaj. H 107 
provide that if the red-hot piece falls earlier ( i. e. before reach- 
ing the 8th circle ) or there is a doubt (whether his hands are 
injured or not) or if he loses his footing or is burnt elsewhere 
than on the hands he should again undergo the ordeal. 
_ Ths ordeal of water as described in the smrtis and digests 
is rather complicated. The Sm. 0. (31 p. m ) re marks that*** 
as the ordeals of water and poison had gone out of vogue ( in 
its day ) ft passes over the procedure of these and takes up the

distance of 150 hastas ( cubits ) from the torana A post of some 
sacred tree is to be fixed in the water and a strong man of one 
of the three higher castes free from love or hatred for the iodhya 
is to stand in navel-deep water facing the east and holding the 
post Then the judge is to make the iodhya stand in water, 
invoke the deities from Dharma to Durga, perform all the rites 
up to the placing of the writing ( embodying the accusation) on 
the head of the sodhya A ksatriya or a brahmana following the 
profession of arms who is of a pure heart and has observed a fast 
should discharge, while standing near the root of the torana, three 
arrows at the target. The iodhya should invoke the water 
with the mantra, ' O Varuna 1 save me by means of truth ' ( Taj. 
H 108 ) S89 . Then a young but swift man should run to the spot 
where the second arrow struck the ground, and stand there 
holding that arrow in his hand. Another swift man stands at 
the root of the torana whence the arrows were discharged. Then 
the judge claps his hands thrice. At the third clap the sodhya 
dives into the water seizing the thighs of the man standing in 
water and at the same time the swift man near the atth runs at 
his best speed to the place where the second arrow fell The other 
man who holds the arrow starts off the moment the first runner 
reaches him and comes running to the arch If he does not see 
the sodhya or sees only his head <i e. the back of the head; 
when he reaches the arch the Sodhya is to be declared innocent ; 
but if he sees other parts of the head ( such as the ear or nose 
&c.) or if the iodhya floats to some part other than tne one 
where he dived he is not innocent

gods and brahmanas The poison to be selected is iarfiga 
fderived from the smga plant) or vatsanabha (aconite) or 
hcumavata(Vvsmim.S.Xm 3,tfar.IV.322 &c). Pitamaha (q. by 
AparSrka p. 712) treats the three as distinct, while Taj. IL 111 
appears to prescribe sarnga growing on the Himalaya as the 
poison to be selected. Yisnu Dh S. (XHL 2-3) also does the same. 
In the rains the quantity of poison is to be six yams in weight, 
in summer five, in hemanta (and sisira) seven or eight and in 
sarad ( autumn) less than the latter (i e. six yavas aco. to Mit. 
and three ace. to V. Mayukha). Poison is to be administered 
in the last watch of the night and never in the noon or after- 
noon or twilight; it was to bB mixed with ghee thirty times 
as much. It may be administered to any one except a brah- 
mana. Visnu Dh. S. XDX 6-7 and Nar. IV, 325 are mantras 
with which the judge invokes poison and Taj. IL 110 is the 
mantra which the iodhja repeats before taking poison viz. 'O 
poison 1 thou art the son of Brahma, thou art firm in the duty of 
(deciding) the truth. Save me from this accusation and be 
like nectar to me by truth (if I be innocent ) \ Nar. IV. 326 
states that then the sodhya should eat the poison, should be 
kept in shade without food and guarded the rest of the day and 
if he discloses no signs of the effect of poison should be declared 
innocent. If the dose of poison is large, the Mit. ( on Taj IL 
111) Bays that when the sodhya shows no change till five 
hundred clappings of hands then he should be declared to be 
innocent and medical treatment should he resorted to. Pita- 
maha says that, in order to prevent fraud, for three or five 
nights before the ordeal the intending sodhya should be kept 
under the supervision of the king's servants and an examination 
should be made whether medicines, incantations or precious 
stones that are antidotes are secretly employed. 

The ordeal of ko&a. The sodhya is made to worship the 
stern deities (such as Eudra, Durga, 5.ditya) with sandal wood 
paste, flowers etc. and made to bathe the images with water. 
Then the judge asks the sodhya to invoke the consecrated water 
with the mantra 'aati/ena mabhiralcsa' (Taj. II 108) and makes 
him drink three handfuls {prasrH ) of that water. Pitamaha 
gives some special rules. The water may be that of the bath 
of the image of that god of which the iodhga is a devotee or if 
he holds all images in equal esteem, then of the Sun In the 
case of Durga it is her spike (sula) that is to be bathed, the 
orb m the case of the Sun and the weapons in the case of other 



3/4 History of Dharmaiustra [ Vol. 

gods The -water of the bath of Durga is to be offered as ordeal 
to thieves and those who live by the profession of arms and the 
■water of the bath of the Sun is not to be given to brahmanas 
In other divyas the result is declared immediately, but in the 
kosa ordeal there is a period of waiting which is more or less 
according to the value of the claim or the gravity of the offence 
Ace to Yaj. H 113, Vismi Dh S 14. 4-5, Nar. IV. 330, if within 
fourteen days of taking the kosa ordeal the sodhya does not 
suffer any serious calamity due to the king's action or the act 
of God or does not fall seriously ill or does not loss by death 
his son or wife or other dear relative or his wealth, then he is to 
be declared innocent Insignificant loss or illness did not 
matter as it is unavoidable in this world. Besides, the calamity 
or illness must not be one common to several people (such as 
an epidemic ). Drinking holy water ( koiapana ) was employed 
not only as an ordeal for proving innocance, but it was resoited 
to also for assuring another about one's good will and future 
honesty (vide Bajat V. 336 ). 

Ordeal of Tandula ( rice grains). It is to be administered 
in charges of theft or disputes about debts or other monetary 
matters. On the preceding day grains of rice should be mode 
white ( i e. husked ). The judge Bhould perform all the rites on 
the previous day. The rice grains should be placed in _ on 
earthen vessel, exposed to the eun, water of the bath of (the 
image of) the sun should be poured over them in the vessel 
and the vessel should be kept in that state the whole night 
The next day in the morning the iodhya should swallow ttriro 
the rice grains He should be made to spit onW^ or tocj 
leaf. If blood is found mixed in his saliva he should be declared 
guilty. i

toiling ghee he should cast a golden, silver, copper or iron seal 
ring once washed. Then he should invoke the ghee with this 
mantra 'Oghee! thou art the holiest thing in sacrifices, thou 
art nectar ; burn him ( the sodhya ) if he is a sinner ; he cool as 
ice if he be innocent.' Then the sodhya takes out the ring from 
the boiling ghee. If there are no marks of scalding on his 
forefinger he is innocent 

Ordeal by photo (ploughshare). This is described by Brhaspati 
(S.B.E. vol. 33 p. 318 verse 28) quoted by the Sm H. p.!19,V.P. 
p. 218 and others. A ploughshare of iron weighing twelve palas, 
eight angulas long and four broad should be made red-hot and 
the ihief should be made to lick it once with his tongue. If he 
is not burnt he establishes his innocence ; if otherwise, he is 
guilty The "Vyavaharatattva ( p 608 ) mentions that ace, to 
Maithila writers the thief meant is a cattle-lifter. The ordeal 
mentioned in the Chandogya TJpanisad is apftafo divya. 

Ordeal of dltarma (i. e of the images or pictures of Dharma). 
Men guilty of causing bodily injuries or who have monetary 
disputes or who desire to undergo this ordeal as an expiation for 
sins should undergo this. A silver image of Dharma and a leaden 
or iron one of Adhaxma should be prepared or the judge should 
draw on a birch leaf or a piece of cloth figures or pictures of 
Dharma and Adharma respectively white and dark in colour. 
Having sprinkled pancayaeyu over the two, he should worship 
them with white and dark flowers respectively. The images or 
figures should then be placed in two balls of clay or cowdung. 
The two balls should be then placed inside a new earthen vessel 
in a cowdunged spot in the presence of images of gods and 
in the presence of brahmanas. _ Then the judge should perform 
all the rites from the invocation of Dharma to the placing of 
the writing on the head. The sodhya should repeat the words 
' if I am free from guilt may ( the image or picture of ) Dhanna 
come to my hands '. Saying this he should take out one ball 
from the vessel. If he takes out Dharma he is innocent This 
Tesembles the drawing of lots. 

Ordeals played their part in the judicial systems of most 
ancient countries. In early England handling of red-hot iron 
and plunging the hand in boiling water were the commonest 
ordeaK In the ordeal of water sinking was a sign of innocence 
and floating of guilt. Stephens (History of Criminal Law of 
England, vol I. p ?3) suggests that the ordeal of water 



376 History of Dliarmaiastra [ Vol. 

was a form of honourable suicide. The Assize of Northampton 
( 1176 A. D ) prescribed the ordeal of water for murder, robbery, 
theft, forgery and arson, but ordeals were abolished in England 
from 1215 A. D. .( ibid, vol 1 p. 300 ) In India 591 there is epigra- 
phic and other evidence to show that ordeals were resorted to 
till the end of the 18th century and rarely even later. In the 
Kittur Pillar Inscription (J.B.B E A.S vol IX. pp. 307-309 ) 
dated in Kaliyuga era 4289 in the reign of Kadamba king 
Jayakesideva there is a description of the phaladivya which was 
administered by mutual agreement on Sunday to an acarya 
Sivasakti who had a dispute about a plot of land with Kalyana- 
sakti the acarya of another shrine and whose hand was exami- 
ned the next day after he underwent the ordeal by all the 
bankers of the agrahara village Degave In the Silimpur stone 
slab Inscription of the time of Jayapaladeva (E. I vol XHI. 
p. 283 at p. 291-292) there is a reference to the ordeal of 

591 In Beat's ' Buddhist Records of the Western world, 'vol I p. 84 
(also Waiters on Yuan Chwang's travels vol. I p 172) four kinds of ordeals 
are mentioned as in vogue, viz. by -water, fire, weight and poison. In the 
water ordeal the accused is placed in a sack connected with a stone vessel 
and thrown into deep water If the man sinks and the stone floats he is 
guilty , if the man floats and the stone sinks then he is pronounced Innocent. 
The ordeal by fire is they heat a plate of iron and iake the accused at on 
it and agam place his- feet on it and apply it to the palms of his hands, 
moreover he is made to pass his tongue over it. If no scar results he ., 
innocent , if there are scars his guilt is proved In the ordeal by Wight » 
man and a stone are placed evenly in a balance If the accused is umocot>l 
the stone rises in the balance, if he is guilty the man rises wat"»« 
falls In the ordeal of poison an incision is made m the right thigh of ■ m

a coin or ring or a piece of metal from a large vessel in which 
either water or oil or ghee had been brought to the boiling 
point) in which the person undergoing it had his right hand 
burnt up to the middle joints of the fingers and was deolared 
to be false. In a Marathi publication called ' Vatanpatrem, 
nivadapatrem &o ' pp. 46-56 edited by P. V. Mavjee and 
D. B. Parasnis (1909) there is a document which describes in 
great detail the ordeal of fire undergone in connection with a 
dispute about the office and emoluments of Deshpande in the 
district of Kalyan in Arte 1666 Pausa bright 11th, Thursday 
( 1745 A D. ). It is stated therein that the ordeal was performed 
on the tank of the sacred river Godavarl at Kopargaon in 
accordance with Dharmasastra in the presence of the Peshwa 
himself and learned brahmanas and panfrtas near the temple 
of the god Sri Suklesvara, that as the opponent was long in

possession the ordeal had to be performed by the man claiming 
title, that an iron ball of 50 palas (i.e. 166 tolas and two 
masas) was heated red-hot and the sodhya carried it across 
seven circles and threw it in the 8th circle on flour and bundles 
which began to burn, that his hands were examined in the 
presence of the opponent and the respeotable people and were 
found unaffected and the opponent was made to pass a docu- 
ment of victory to the Sodhya called ' yejitapatra'. The des- 
cription agrees very closely with that given above. In the 
same work at pp. 36-41 there is a remarkable description about 
an ordeal undergone (in 1742 A. V ) by Mabomedan litigants 
in their own mosque for 15 days by lighting lamps and sitting 
down in the shrine. There are several other valanpatras in 
the same work which refer to ordeals. 

For an informing article on divyas reference may be made 
to Dr. Dines Chandra Sirkar's 'The successors ^ of the Sata- 
vahanas' Appendix: pp 354-376 (Calcutta, 1939) He quotes 
therein a passage from the 'Asiatic Researches' vol. 1, from 
which it appears that a magistrate named Ali Ibrahim Khan at 
Benares tried byphala dwya two cases xa 1783 A D. and reported 
them to the then Governor-General, "Warren Hastings. In the 
"Trtiya-sammelana-vxtta ' (pp. 18-36) and in the Catuitha- 
sammelana-vrtta pp 100-154 of the Bharata-itihasa-Bamsodhaka- 
mandala at Poona (both in Marathi) Mr Bhaskar Taman Bhat 
contributes two thoughtful and scholary papers onthe adminis-

part played by ordeals is described at some length.

CHAPTER XV 
DECISION 

The last (i.e. 4th) stage in a judicial proceeding is siddhi 
(Ya]. DL8) or nnnaya (decision). If pratyakalita (as defined 
above on p 298) is regarded as a pada of oyaoahai a (and since all 
are agreed that there are only four padas) then the decision is not 
a pada of a lawsuit but is the fruit thereof ( V. P. p. 86 ). When 
the evidence has been led, the king ( or chief justice ) should 
with the help of the sabhyas decide upon the success or failure 
of the plaintiff 594 . Nar. II. 42 says that the sabhyas should ask 
the parties to leave the court when they are considering their 
verdict or what decision was to be pronounced 555 . It is stated 
by Vyasa and Sukra W. 5. 271 that the decision of a case is 
based on eight sources 596 ( 6 ace to Sukra) via. the three prarriayas 
(possession, documents and witnesses), logical inference, the 
usages of the country, sapathas( oaths and ordeals), the king's 
ediot and tb.B admission of the litigants. Pitamaha prescribes 
that, in disputes where there are no witnesses, no possession nor 
documents and no recourse can be had to divine proof, there the 
king is the final deciding factor as he is the lord of all 587 . 

It is stated by Narada H. 41 and 43 that, whether a party 
is defeated by his own admission or by his own conduct ( i. e 
because he adduces false witnesses or forged documents) or

whether he is defeated after full trial and the adducing of proof, it 
is proper that the defeat should be declared by the sabbyas ( the 
judges) and that a Jayapatra (a document of success ie. a judgment) 
should be given to the successful party couched in fitting terms 
Several verses of Narada ( quoted by Apararka p. 684), Brhaspati 
(SBJ. vol. 33 p 307 verge 19), Kat. (259-265), Vrddha-Vasislha 
(q. by Mit. on Yaj H 91- and Apararka p. 684) and Vyasa 
( Sm C H. p 57 ) lay down the contents of the judgment ** 
It was to contain a brief statement of the plaint, the reply, 
the evidence, the depositions of witnesses, discussion thereof, 
arguments, the smrti texts applicable, the opinion of the 
sabhyas, the decision and the relief granted, and should bo 
signed by the chief justice and bear the royal seal Vas. 19 10 
refers to precedents also in the decision of cases and the" award- 
ing of punishments ( agamad-drstanlaoca ) The Mit quotes a 
smrti text (on Yaj. H 91 ) that other members of the assembly 
( who are not judges ) proficient in smrti may also sign the 
judgment to show that the decision is acceptable to them also. 
But this was not absolutely necessary, as is made clear by the 
Vivadacandra p. 146. Kat ( 256 ) applies the word paidilhara * 
(refutation) to a judgment containing the above particulars 
given after a complete contest, while he restricts the word 
jayapatra to a document (given by the radge) when a plarotifi 
becomes what is called hinaiadi (because he makes a change 
in his pleading or for similar cause ) and when there has been no 
complete trial of an action; and such a document embodies only 
what happened. Kant. (HI. 19) appears to employ the word 
•pascatkara'ina somew hat different sense when he sayt, mo

The Mit ( on Yaj. IL 91 ) differing from Kit holds a jayapatra 
to be a judgment giving 'a summary of the plaint, the reply, 
the evidence and the decision, while when a plaintiff is defea- 
ted for change of pleading or for default of appearance or for 
non-prosecution the document stating this is called 'hhiapatiaka'. 
It is to be regretted that ancient jayapatras in Sanskrit have 
not yet been discovered. In 25 Calcutta Weekly Notes 
pp. CXLH— III Dr. Jolly communicated the substance of a 
jayapatra, couched in ancient Javanese, engraved on a copper- 
plate found in the island of Java and described by Dr. Brandes 
in a Dutch paper. That judgment is dated iake 849 ( 928 A. D.), 
relates to a dispute about a debt of one subarna in which the 
plaintiff failed because he did not appear at the trial. At the 
end there are the signatures of four witnesses and the document 
is styled jayapatra at the end. Vide for the same jayapatra 
J. B. O. R. S. vol. VE pp. 117 ff The late Mr. K P. Jayaswal 
published in 24 Calcutta Weekly Notes (pp. CXLLX-CLVjT) a 
jayapatra (text, translation and remarks) granted by the Hindu 
court of Mithila in iake 1716 (1794 A. D.) and in J. B. 0. R. S. 
vol. VIpp 246-258, which strictly conforms to the rules of 
procedure laid down in the smrtis and nibandhas and is couched 
in dignified, technical and scrupulously formal language. It 
related to the ownership of a slave girl. Plaintiff at first made 
default in appearance; the judgment notes this and also refers 
to the restoration of the suit. The defendant raised an objection 
that a single witness to prove a matter was inadmissible. This 
objection was upheld. Then plaintiff prayed that he might be 
allowed to undergo an ordeal, but this request was disallowed 
as human proof was possible and plaintiff ultimately lost his 
suit The judgment is written and signed by one Sacala- 
misra, who was the chief justice, and is addressed to other 
members of the sabha, called dharmSdhyaksas and panditas 
seven of whom express their concurrence (sammah) at the top 
of the document. Vide Journal of the Bihar and Orissa 
Research Society vol XXVBI for 1942 for nine Sanskrit 
jayapatras from the courts of Mithila in the 18th and 19th 
centuries. 

The Mit. (on Yaj IL 91), and V. Matrka p. 309 note that,a 
jayapatra is given specially to prevent the same matter being

The defeated party has to pay a fine to the king and the 
successful party was complimented (or honoured) by the king 
(or chief justice) and was to be put in possession of the matter 
that he succeeded in proving 601 . Manu V3JL 51 prescribes 
that in monetary matters (i.e. in civil disputes) the defeated 
party should be made by the king to pay the judgment debt to 
the successful party and also some fine to the king according 
to his ability, while Manu YEI 139 lays down that when the 
defendant admits in the court his liability he has to pay to the 
king five per cent as fine and if the defendant denied his liabi- 
lity altogether and was proved to be false he had to pay as 
fine double of that (i e ten per cent) This is analogous to 
court fee, for which see above pp. 294-295. J£ one or both parte

' anusista ' have been variously explained ro . The word ' tlrita * 
is very ancient and occurs in the Delhi Pillar Edict IV of 
Asoka (EI. Vol. H. p. 253 ) as ' tilita-dandanam ' qualifying men 
imprisoned in jails. Medhatithi and Kulluka explain them as 
' decided according to the rules of the sastra' and 'taken so far 
as to recover fine from the unsuccessful party' respectively. 
K&t. (495) defines them differently : ""When a certain Bide is 
decided by the sabhyas themselves ( without the examination 
of witnesses) to be either true or false, it is said to be tlrita and 
that matter or side is called ' anusista' whioh is declared (to be 
true or false) on the testimony of witnesses." The lexcion called 
Vaijayantl seems to have Kat. in mind and defines 'tlrita' as a 
perverse decision given by the sabhyas themselves and 
'anusista' occurs where the evidence of witnesses makes what is 
true appear as false (Bhumikanda, vaisyadhyaya, verses 11-12). 
Nai. EL 65 ( S.B. E. vot 33 p 22 j employs the twowords, whioh 
the Mit on Taj. H 306 respectively explains as (tlrita) 'decided 
by reliance on documents and witnesses but not carried so far 
as to recover a fine '.and ('anusista') as* decided so far as to 
recover a fine from the defeated party '. Vide Apararka p. 866 
and V. P p. 90 for explanations. 

According to Est. quoted in the Vyavaharasara (p 101 )«* 
the decree should provide for the successful party receiving the 
interest on or accretions to the movable or immovable pro- 
perty placed (during the pendency of the suit) in the hands of 
a third party ( as a sort of Eeceiver ). Kat. ( 477-480 ) points 6D5 
out the various ways in which a decree may he executed. The 
kmg should make a hrahma na debtor return the decretal debt

whether a ksatnya, vaisya, sudra or husbandman, work (fo 
the creditor) If he be unable to work the debtor should be 
sent to jail except when he is a brahmana Manu also (IX. 229 ) 
says that if the members, of the three varaas other than brah- 
mana are unable to pay the fine imposed by the king they 
phonld be made to work for the king, but a brahmana may be 
allowed to pay m easy and small instalments. If a brahmana 
debtor was unable to pay, nothing could be done for recovery 
of the decretal debt except taking a surety from him if any one 
cared to be one In modern times also judgment debtors are 
liable to be arrested and detained in civil jail in execution of 
decrees under rules 55-58 of the Indian Civil Procedure code 
( except women in execution of a decree for the payment of 
money ). If in ancient times state policy exempted brShroanas 
from arrest and detention in a civil jail for monetary debtB on 
spiritual grounds and on the ground of caste, in modern times thB 
State in Indra exempts agriculturists from arrest or imprisonment 
in execution of a decree for money on economic grounds under 
certain legislative enactments like sec. 21 of the Decoan Agri- 
culturists ' Relief Act ( Bombay Act XVU of 1879 ) As regards 
women also Kat. ( 488-489 ) laid down certain prudent rules 
" Women who are not ^ independent should not be arrested (for 
offences like adultery ) ; it is the male who should be regarded as 
the offender ; women should be punished by their lord (i e the 
person on whom they depend) hut the king should take away 
for punishment the male offender Even if a woman whose 
husband has gone abroad he consigned to jail she should be kept 
imprisoned only till he returns." The Sm. C. -IL p 323 explains

Har (IL 40) lays down* 07 a qualification that when a party 
has been defeated hy his own conduct (La. by his demeanour 
or by his having adduced manifestly false witnesses or forged 
documents) there is to be no retrial or review of judgment, hut 
where a man has lost his cause through (the dishonesty of) 
witnesses or the sabhyas, the cause may be tried anew. TheTe 
■ are four exceptions to the finality of the judgments of the king's 
court. Where a litigant either through folly or insolence 603 
thinks a decision to be wrong, he may be allowed a retrial, 
provided he agrees to pay double the fine inflicted on the losinp 
party (Yaj H 306, Ear. L 65, Kat. 4%). Secondly, where tht 
former judgment is obtained by fraud or force, it may be set 
aside (Yaj. n. 31) « w . Thirdly, where the litigant was incompetent, 
i.e. was a woman or a minor or a lunatic or intoxicated, seriously 
ill or distressed by a calamity or where the proceeding was 
carried on by another on behalf of a litigant who did not appoint 
him or with whom he was not connected in any way or was held 
inside a house or outside a town or village ( i. e. in a forest ) or 
by an enemy, the decision may be set aside and a retrial ordered 
( Nar. L 43 in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 16, Ysj. IL 31-38 ). Fourthly, a 
king could set right a former decision of his predecessor 
which was unjust and arrived at through ignorance ( Mit on 
Yaj. H. 306 ) 610 . ' 

Yaj. (H. 4 and 305 ) prescribes that legal proceedings that 
axe suspected to have been wrongly decided by the sabhyas 
through partiality or greed or intimidation should again be tried 
by the king and if the suspicion turns out to be true he should 
levy from the sabhyas and the party who at first succeeded double 
the fine that is unposed on a defeated party. i*ar.I66 (in S.B.E 
vol. 33 p. 22 ) is similar. Ma nuEU^ - Mateya SW.MB)

Though there is hardly any express smrti text for the 
transfer of cases from one court or judge to another court or 
judge, in practice this must have been done, though rarely In 
Selections from Feshwa'sDaf tar" vol 43 p 108 there is a letter 
( of 12-8-1764 A. D ) written by the renowned minister Nana 
Phadms to the Peshwa Madhavrao in which the former 
endeavours to persuade the latter to cancel his order for transfer 
of a case from the court of Ramsastri, famed for his impartiali- 
ty and strict life, to another judge on the ground that one of the 
litigants was afraid that Ramsas,tri showed Borne partiality to 
the other litigant. Manu ( VUI 174-175) states that the king 
who decides the causes of people unjustly through greed is soon 
subjugated by his enemies, while the king who curbing his own 
temper and desires impartially decides causes according to tbo 
dictates of sastra becomes of one mind with his subjects as 
rivers merge in the ocean, Br and Nar I 74 ( S B.E vol. 33 
p 24 ) lay emphasis on both the secular and spiritual effects of 
doing even justice, saying that when the king gives decisions 
according to sastra he spreads his fame in this world and 
secures Heaven* 11 

A crime may b9 defined as an act or omission that breaks 
the law and is subject to public punishment But all kindi of 
breaches of the law do not result in punishment; only somo do. 
Those breaches are crimes which are deemed to bo menaces to the 
conditions of existence of society, which society, tbo rnlcr or 
legislation recognises as preventable only through punishment 
The menace is not that of the specific action, but the abstract 
menace inherent in that type of action. A breach that is hew 
to be a crime at one time may even be held not to bo o crimo 
at another time or in another country. For examplo, adultery 
is a crime under the Indian Penal Code (sec 497 }, while h »" 
not a crime but a civil wrong in English Law. __ _

HI J Evolution of the idea of crimes 38? 

Many crimes and wrongs were sins and entailed secular 
punishments and also religious sanctions (viz expiations, 
prayamttas). Vide Manu JX. 336, 240, Br. (S. B, E. vol 33, 
p. 362, verse 22) and Paithlnasi quoted below 613 . Maine in his 
' Ancient Law ' chap. X ( 3rd ed of 1866 ) examines ancient 
western systems like those of Greece and Rome and makes 
the generalisation (p. 370) that the 'penal law of ancient 
communities is not the law of crimes ; it is the law of wrongs 
or, to use the English technical word, of Torts The peison 
injured proceeds against the wrong-doer by an ordinary civil 
action and recovers compensation in the shape of money damages 
if he succeeds'. Dr. Priya Nath Sen in his Tagore Law Lectures 
on ' Hindu Jurisprudence ' (1918, Lecture XII) rightly points out 
that this generalisation is not applicable to Ancient Hindu Law. 
It has already been shown ( on pp. 264-266 ) that the king 
could of his own motion take cognisance of many wrongs called 
chalas, padas and aparadlias and it is clear that in such crimes as 
theft, assault, adultery, rape, and manslaughter the smrti texts do 
not prescribe only a money compensation to the person wronged 
but corporal punishment in the first instance and monetary 
compensation in addition. Vide for example, Manu VIH 287 
Ya 3 . II 222, Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 358 verses 9-10), Kai (787) which 
prescribe a punishment for causing pain to the body or the loss 
of a limb and also the expenses of curing the person injured 
and some solatium to him « Ap. Dh S ( L 9. 24. 1 and 4 ) lavs 
down that the slayer of a ksatoya should give a thousand coL 
m order to remove &e enmity (i. e as compensation to rela- 
tives and one bull in addition for expiation.™ The Ghandogya 
Upamsad quo ed above { p. 362 ) shows that a thief was punTsSd 
with deathmthose early days. There isapassage in theTaTsn.

rendering of this word as 'possessed of plentiful heritage or

'a hero whose wergild is a hundred '. This is incorreot, confound- 
ing as it does the ideas of western Germanic tribes with the 
Rgveda composed several millenniums earlier It would be a 
strange thing' to pray to a goddess for a son and at the same 
time to have in mind or refer to the price get upon him if he 
happened to be killed. 

The ancient smrti writers were quite aware of the several 
purposes served by punishments for crimes, 616 though they 
do not develop a regular science of penology. The person 
wronged feels a great urge for revenge or retaliation and other 
men sympathise with that emotion The individual, however, 
could not, in civilized societies, take the law into his own 
hands and therefore the State saw to it that the emotion for 
retaliation or revenge was to some degree satisfied by the 
adequate punishment of the wrongdoer. Yaj. II. 16 and Nar. 1. 46 
(SBE vol, 33 p. 17) state that when a person without complaining 
to the king sets about to secure what is denied by the opposite 
side or is doubtful he becomes liable to punishment and he also 
cannot secure the object he wants. 6,6B In all anoient societies

almost the same as tfar., parusya, verse 25 ), Yaj H. 215, 
Visnu Dh. S. V. 19 and' Sankha-Likhita prescribe that with 
whatever limb 618 a man of low caste offends against a 
brahraana, that very limb of his shall be cut off. Another and- 
the most important purpose of punishment is deterrent. 
Punishment of the evil-doer serves as an example and a warning 
to all others that might be tempted to tread the paths of 
violence and crime. This aspect of punishment ( danda ) has 
already been dwelt upon in the section on rajadharma ( p. 21 ). 
The end sought to be served by punishment was the protection of 
Booiety and the securing of its happiness. The Santiparva(15 5-6) 
remarks that people do not commit sins through fear of punish- 
ment at the hands of the king, through fear of Tama and of the 
next world and through fear of others ( i. e public opinion ).*" 
Gaut XL 28 derives the word davda from the root dam to restrain 
or to deter. This purpose of punishment is well brought out in 
the Mrcchakatika ( X ) when the sentence passed on Carudatta 
for t 1 ^ alleged murder of Vasantasena is proclaimed to the 
citizens by the executioners (X> Another purpose of punishment

Another purpose was that of reform or redemption of the evil- 
doer The punishment was deemed to be a sort of expiation, 
which purged the man of sinful promptings and reformed hi* 
character. Manu YET 318 ( = Vas. 19 45 ) states that men who 
are guilty of crimes and have been punished by the king go to 
heaven, becoming pure like those who perform mentoiious deeds 
Medhatithi remaiks on this verse that this applies only where 
the punishment is corporal and not merely monetary It will 
be seen from the early sutras like that ot Gautama and from 
the Manusmrti that the more ancient criminal law in India was 
very severe and drastic, but that from ttiB times of Yajnavalkya, 
Nar. and Br. the rigour of punishments was lessened and 
softened and fines came to be the ordinary punishments for 
many crimes, as is noted byFa Hien ( 399-400 A D ) in relation 
to middle India (Madhyade&a) under the Guptas apparently ' Tho 
king governs without decapitation or other corporal punishments 
Criminals are simply fined, lightly or heavily according to tho 
circumstances Even in circumstances of repeated attempts at 
wicked rebellion they only have their right hands cut off 
(Legge,1886 p 43). This may be contrasted with the state 
of things depicted by Megasthenes 700 years earlier than Fa 
Hien : ( fragment XXVH p. 71 ) ' a person bearing false witness 
suffers mutilation of his extremities. He who maims anyone not 
only suffers loss of the same limb but his hand also is cut on

gate Hill for stealing a box of paints worth two pence, was 
tried at the Old Bailey and hanged (vide 'In the service of 
youth', by Dr. J M. Brew, 1943 chap XV. p 208). 

Manu VE 129, Y«a I 367 and Br. (S B E. 33 p. 387 
verse 5), Vrddha-Harita (7195) spssak of four methods of 
punishment ( donrfa ) viz. by gentle admonition by severe 
reproof, by fine and by corporal punishment and declare that 
these punishments may be inflicted separately or together 
according to the nature of the offence. 021 The first takes 
the form of saying ' you have not done a proper thing ', the 
2nd ' fie upon you who are a wrongdoer and guilty of adharnia ' 
Br. lays down that preceptors, pin ohitas and sons should be 
sentenced to the punishment of wordy admonition, other persons 
who engage in disputes should he punished with reproof ot 
fines and those guilty of mahapatakas should be punished 
with corporal punishment That admonition and reproof 
were two modes of punishment shows that ancient 
writers were alive to the notion that among very sensitive 
persons or in a very sensitive society verbal condemnation 
would be enough to achieve the main purposes of punishment 
Br. ( SBE vol. 33 p. 388 verse 8 ) states that the first two are 
within the privilege of the brahmana (appointed as chief justice) 
but fines and corporal punishment are to be inflicted by the king 
( on the recommendation of the chief justice, pra$viv5lcamate 
slhitah ). The Mrcchakatika ( IX ) beais this out when the judge 
says ' We have authority only to pronounce the judgment; as to 
the rest the king is the final authority' (nirnaye vayam piamanam 
iese tu 10.3a ) Gaut. XIL 51, Vas. 19 9, Manu VII. 16, VUL 126 
and Ta.3 I. 368 ( =Vrddha-HarIta VII. 195-196 ), Brhat Para- 
sara p. 284, Kaut IV. 10 lay down that the award of punishment 
must be regulated by a consideration of the motive and nature 
of the offence, the time and place, the strength, age, conduct (or 
duties), learning and monetary position of the offender and by the

fact whether the offence 622 is repeated. This provision means that 
the dharmasastras did not hold that the same punishment must 
be meted out for the same offence irrespective of the antecedents, 
characteristics or physical and mental condition of the offender. 
They always took extenuating circumstances into account. Kaut 
( I. 4 ), differing from the view of the acaryas that there is no- 
thing like danda for bringing under one's complete control all 
beings, gives his own opinion that, as a king whose control and 
punishments are most severe makes the subjects disgusted with 
him and as the king who deals mild punishments is disregarded 
by the people, the king should distribute punishments according 
to the deserts of the offenders and would then command respect 6a 
One reason why some of the works on dharmasastra prescribe 
mild punishments is the doctrine of karmampSka (a man 
committing certain sins is born in the next life afflicted with 
certain diseases or bodily deficiencies or is born as a low or 
filthy beast or bird) Vide Manu XI 49-52, Y83 HI 207-216, 
VisnuDh. S 44-45. This doctrine will be dealt with later on 
under pataka and prayasatta. Gaut. XIL 48 first provides that the 
king must take into account, when awarding punishment to to 
criminal, his physical or monetary circumstances.the nature of 
the crime, the fact of repetition of the crime and then adds that 
the king should award punishment after consulting an assembly 
of learned brahmanas The Dandaviveka (p. 36) quotes a 
verse in which the considerations that should weigh m ^ward- 
ing punishment are brought together viz. the offender's caste 
(as in Manu VUL 337-338 for theft ), the value of the thing, w 
extent or measure (as in Manu VIII 320), use or usefulness of U» 
thing with regard to which an offence is committed (as » i *» 
VIE 285), the person against whom an offence is committed pro 
as an idol or temple or king or brahmana), age, ability (topay>.

qualities, time, place, the nature of the offence (whether it is 
repeated or is a first offence ). The EajataranginI(VHL158) 
provides that in disputes where parties are in doubt as to their 
rights it is proper to award punishment with forbearance but 
where a man starts on an evil path of set purpose ( the king and 
officers) must award severe punishment. In modern times there 
are controversies among several schools of criminology. Some 
• bold that every man bas freedom to act criminally or not or to 
act in the way he does and that each man has complete moral 
responsibility for bis own acts. On the other band there are 
some who go to the other extreme and propound that a so-called 
criminal act is mostly due to biological, physiological, patho- 
logical or sociological conditions, to the upbringing and 
environment of the person charged with crime. They favour 
determinism The ancient Indian writers do not enter into 
these speculations. But wben they said that regard must be 
paid to time and place and other considerations they were faintly 
conscious of or were groping towards the ideas of the 2nd school. 

Fines are either fixed or not fixed ( i. e. variable ). They 
range from a fcafetpt to the confiscation of all wealth; fixed 
fines were of three kinds called prathama sahasa, madhyama sahasa 
(middling amercement) and vOama sahasa (highest). These are 
variously defined. According to Sankha-Likhita the first 6 * 
amercement is fine "from 84 panas to 91, the middling one is 
from 200 t o 500 panas and the highest is from six hundred to 1000

in proportion to the value of the matter in dispute or the injury 
caused Mami VHL 138 ( = Visnu Dh S. IV. 10 ) states that the 
first, middling and highest fines are respectively 250, 500 and 
1000 panas, while Yaj I 366 puts these respectively at 370, 540 
and 1080. The Mit explains that the lesser figures of Mann re- 
present the fines to bo awarded for offences committed without 
set purpose. Nar. ( sahasa, verses 7-8 ) prescribes that 100 panas 
is the lowest limit of fines for the lowest kind of suhasn, 500 is 
the lowest for middling sahasa, 1000 is the lowest fine in what 
is called the highest amercement (and might include death 
penalty, forfeiture of all property, banishment, branding and 
cutting off of a limb ). Fines were supposed to be lesser than 
corporal punishment. Est (490-493) lays 62S down the follow- 
ing rules : Whatever figure of fine is prescribed in the smrti 
texts for a wrong it is to be paid to the king in panas of coppBr or 
their equivalent. Where the fine is said to be one-fourth or one 
half of a masa, there it is a golden mass that is meant; when 
the fine is declared in niasas, they are to be understood as thoso 
of silver and where the fine is declared in krsnalas the same is 
to be understood; a masa is -jfcth of a karsapana * Tho 
general rule that lesser punishment is to be inflicted on women 
is stated by Eat. ( 487 ) ' In the case of all offences, women are to 
suffer half of the fine in money which is prescribed for a mole 
offender ( of the same kind ) and when the punishment is death 
for a male, the punishment for a woman would be the excision 
of a limb.' «* Kaut (EL 3) provides. ' a woman attains ability to 
enter into transactions on completion of 12 years and mon when 
they art 16; if they disobey after that (i e after attaining 
majority ) the woman shall be fined twelve panas and a man 
twice that amount.' «" Angiras quoted by the Mit (on 3U).

ixteen, women and persons suffering from diseases are to be given 
half prayasoitta and Sankha quoted by the Mit. ( on the same 
verse) that a child less than five commits no crime nor sin by 
any act and is not to suffer any punishment nor to undergo a 
prayasoitta* 25 . Under the Indian Penal Code, sec. 82, nothing 
is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age 
The severity of punishment depended on caste also. In the case of 
theft, Gaut. XIL 15-16, Manu VIE 338-39 prescribe that a vaisya, 
a ksatriya and a brahmana should respectively be fined twice, 
four times and eight times of the fine to be imposed upon a sudra 
for a theft, since each of these is deemed more and more aware 
of the heinousness of the crime. Kat ( 485 ) and Vyasa state 
this as a general rule for all offences 630 . In the case of abuse 
and defamation the scales are turned in favour of the higher 
castes as regards fines. Gaut. XII 1, 8-18, Manu YDL 267-268 
(=Nar.p£rusya 15-16), Yaj IL 306-207 prescribe that a ksatriya 
or a vaisya or a sudra abusing or defaming a brahmana was 
to be respectively punished with the fine of 100 panas, 150 panas 
and with corporal punishment (cutting off the tongue), while 
a brahmana defaming a ksatriya, vaisya or sudra was to be 
fined 50, 25 or 12 panas respectively (nothing in the last case 
ace to Gaut. ZH. 13). In the case of adultery and rape the 
caste of the offender and of the woman concerned made great 
difference in the punishment awarded For adultery with a 
woman of the same caste Ya 3 IL 286 prescribed the highest 
amercement, the middling one when the paramour was of a

carried out by cutting off (or destroying) a limb or to cause 
death. Harassment or pain may be inflicted by imprisonment 
beating, putting fettere, by making ridiculous (by the complete 
shaving of the head, declaring the offence by beat of drum in 
the presence of the convict, parading him through the streets on 
an ass ) and m arkin g him with signs indicative of offences like 
theft. Manu (VEL 125) provides that punishment may fall 
upon any one (or more) of ten places in the case of the 
three higher castes, viz. the private parts, the belly, the tongue 
(either whole or half), the hands, the feet, the eyes, the nose, 
the ears, wealth and the whole body; but a brahmana shall 
depart unhurt from the country (i e. he is to be only banished). 
Br. (SBE 33 p. 388 verses 9-10) speaks of fourteen places of 
punishment adding the neck, the thumb and index, the fore- 
head, the lips, the hind part, hips, one half of the feet (to 
Manu's ten) and omitting wealth and the whole body there- 
from. Gaut. 331 43, Kaut. IV. 8, Manu (VUL 125, 380-381), 
Yaj. H. 270, Nar. (sahasa, 9-10), Visnu V. 1-8, Br. (SBE. vol 
33 p. 388 verse 11), Vrddha-Harlta VJL 191 prescribe that 
a brahmana was not to be sentenced to death or corporal 
punishment for any offence whatever, but if he were guilty of 
an offence deserving the death penalty, he was to be punished 
by ordering his entire head to be Bhaved, he might be banished 
from the country (from the city ace. to Nar. ), a mark appro- 
priate to the grave sin committed by him might be branded on 
his forehead and he might be paraded on an ass. 631 Yatna,' 32

the king to keep a brahmana offender in confinement in a 
secret place and give him bare maintenance or the king may- 
make him do the work of guarding cattle for a month or a 
fortnight or make him perform other work not fit for a decent 
brahmana. The Mit. on Yaj. H. 270 explains that the mark 
of female private parts for violating guru's bed, of a tavern 
for drinking the liquor called sura, a dog's foot for theft, of a 
headless corpse for brahmana murder (as laid down by Manu 
DL 237 and 240, Visnu Dh S. V. 4) is to be made on the 
forehead only if the offender (whether a brahmana or not) 
did not perform prayasatta for those grave sins. Branding 
with marks appropriate to the crime committed were in vogue 
in Borne and in Britain up to 1699 (such as the mark of the 
letter M for murderers, T for thieves &o.). Vide Barnes' 
'Story of punishment' p. 62. The Ba jatarahginl (IV. 96-106) 
refers to a case in the reign of king Candraplda of Kashmir 
when a brahmana guilty of the murder of a brahmana was 
exempted from death sentence because of the smrti rule. 
Manu JX. 241 gives option that a brahmana (unintentionally ) 
guilty of grave offences may be punished with the middle 
amercement or he may be banished from the realm keeping 
all his wealth. The punishments for a brahmana offender? 
according to Gaut. XH. 44, were preventing him from doing 
the same thing again, depriving him of all wealth, taking 
sureties from him, proclaiming him as a thief in the city 
banishment, putting on his forehead the mark indicative of his 
crime. Kp. Db.S. (JL 10 27. 16-17 )«* lays dowll ^t a te5toai)a 
guilty of murder, theft, forcible seizure of another's land was 
to have his eyes covered over with cloth for the whole of his life 
(while a sudra guilty of any of the three was to receive the death 
sentence ). Vrddha-Harita ( VIL209-210 ) says that a brahmana 
should be branded on the body for all those offences that entailed 
corporal punishment for other offenders, that he should have bis 
head shaved, that he should be deprived of all his property and 
banished from the realm. The force of popular feeling on the 
point of exempting a brahmana offender from the death sentence 
was so great that Elphinstone (Governor of Bombay) in Regu- 
lation 14 of 1827, sec. IV (cl. 5) exempted brahmanas and women 
from death sentence even for murder where public feeling would

absence o/ a fine occurs only in the case of a brahmana who «as a first 
offender, who dtd not commit the offence with forethought and who was 
endowed mth learning, good family and charactei The Sro C II p 124 
relying on Mann IX 236 says that a brahmana could be imprisoned bat he 
could not be subjected to such corporal punishment as catting off a limb or 
whipping The Smrtis openly regarded the brahmana's person as sacred 
and so saved his body The smrtis endeavoured to reach the ideal of the 
role ot law and succeeded to a great extent in doing so They held that every 
man, whatever his rant or condition, was subject to the ordinary law of the 
realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals The only 
differential treatment that we find is in the appointment of judges (pp, 272- 
273 ), m the order of taking up causes of litigants (p 298), in the punishment 
for perjury (Manu VIII 123-124), in the matter of corporal punishment, 
in abuse, defamation and assault {pp 395-397), in punishment for adultery, 
in the repayment of debts and m the punishment for theft, which was severer 
for a brahmana It will be shown below that from the 13th century, as 
indicated by the Sm C , S. V. and Madanaratna, differential punishments 
had gone out of vogue The smrtis did not, like some modern freedom-loving 
people, declare the equality of all before the law on paper and in practice 
indulge in 'lynching. Further the smrtis required all offenders ot whatever 
caste to be brought before the same tribunals Mann VIII. 335 and Yaj. 
I 35S emphasize that there is none who is exempt from punishment 
in the king's court whether the person be the king's father or teacher or 
friend or mother or wife or a son or a family priest or brother or father-in 
law or maternal ancle Sankha-LiUuta and Kat (481 J no doubt say thai 
a king should not punish his parents, his family priest, teacher, near 
relatives, forest hermits, ascetics But, as the Sm C. II. p. 126 explains, 
the real meaning is not that the king is to allow these to escape scot-free, 
but that he should not inflict corporal punishments or fines on these, hot 
should employ admonition or severe reproof towards them Thestortis

causing abortion, if he be a thief {of gold) or if he kills 
a brahmana woman with a sharp weapon or if he kills 
a chaste woman'. Kautilya (IV. 11) prescribes that a 
brahmana who aims at the kingdom or who forces entrance 
into the king's harem or who incites wild tribes or enemies 
{ against his king ) or who foments disaffection ( or rebellion ) 
in forte, the country or the army should be sentenced to death 
by drowning. 636 The fact that Carudatta, a brahmana, is 
represented as having been condemned to death by king 
Palaka in the Mrcchakatika indicates that the sentence of 
death against brahmanas was not entirely unheard of. It 
appears from Fick's ' Social organisation ' &c p. 212 that in 
many Jataka passages the execution of brahmanas is referred to. 

The Santiparva chap. 268 contains an interesting dialogue 
between king Dyumatsena and his son prince Satyavat on the 
subject of the punishment of death, which contains some of the 
arguments forcibly urged in these days by those that are 
opposed to capital punishment altogether. The prince pleads 
that punishment Bhould be light even for grave offences, 
that when the sentence of death is carried out in the case of 
robbers, 636 * several innocent persons (such as the wife, the 
mother, the son of the condemned man ) suffer great loss ( and 
they may die also), that if offenders give themselves up to 
priests, swear before them that they will never commit sin 
they may be let off after undergoing penance, that if great men 
go astray their punishment should be proportionate to their 
greatness The king replies that in former ages when people

except for the offence of subverting the state. 637 VisnuDhS 
V. 1 provides that all persons except brahmanas guilty of the 
mahapatakas may be sentenced to death. But Manu IX. 236 
says that this extreme penalty was to be awarded only if they 
performed no prayascitta. Kaut (IV. 11) prescribes death 
sentence for causing the death of any one with a sharp weapon. 
Vrddha-Harlta (VII 190) prescribes it for incendiaries, poisoners, 
murderers, robbers, bad characters, rogues and those guilty of 
grave sins. The death sentence was carried out in various 
ways such as by giving poison or by trampling at the feet 
of an elephant, or by a sharp weapon (like a sword), by 
being burnt or drowned 638 . Impalement was a punishment pres- 
cribed by Manu IX. 276 for thieves guilty of housebreaking by 
night ( after first cutting off their hands ), by Taj H. 273 for 
those who made another a captive or stole horses and elephants 
or killed another by the use of force and by Vrddha- 
Harlta VH 202 for the murderer of a brahmana or for one who 
killed a woman, a child or a cow. Death sentence by being 
trampled under the feet of an elephant continued up to the 
times of the Marathas. The Dasakumaracarita 4th TJcchvSsa 
shows that a thief could be trampled upon by an elephant by 
way of punishment Vide ' Selections from Peshwa's IMter 
(edited by Mr. G. S Sardesai) vol. 43 Ho. 143 p 114 (Med 
7-9-1775 A. D.), where out of seven dacoite of the Berad caste

is prescribed by Manu IX. 271 for those who abet thieves by- 
giving them subsistence, instruments of house-breaking or 
asylum. K a man of a low caste had sexual intercourse with a 
woman of a higher caste (with or without her consent) or 
kidnapped a maiden he was to be sentenced to death ( Manu 
Yin. 366, Yaj. H, 386-388, 294 ) Vas. XXI. 1-5 prescribed for a 
sudra, vaisya or ksatriya guilty of adultery with a brahman a 
woman the horrible punishment of being burnt to death after being 
respectively covered with viiaija grass, with red daiblias and iara 
leaves respectively and similar punishment for a sudra paramour 
of a ksatriya or vaisya woman and for a vaisya paramour of a 
ksatriya woman. The consenting woman (adulteress) was, aec. to 
Vas. XXI 1-3, to be shaved , to have her head anointed with clarifi- 
ed butter and to be paraded naked on an ass and left to die on the 
Great Journey, while, ace. toGaut XXHL14 and Manu Vffl. 371, 
an adulteress, vain of her charms or the wealth of her parents,' 
was to be openly devoured by dogs, if her paramour was a man 
of lower caste. Sankha 6 * 1 prescribes this punishment ( of being 
devoured by dogs ) for a woman's paramour of a lower caste and 
for the erring woman death by burning. Vrddha-Harlta VH. 193 
prescribes that in the case of a woman who is a confirmed adul- 
teress, or who destroys her foetus, her husband should have her 
ears, nose and lips cut off and then she should be banished and 
verses 230-331 prescribe death by being burnt with grass 
(katagm) for those guilty of incest. These severe penalties 
for adultery were very much relaxed and softened by later 
smrti writers as is shown in H. of Dh. vol H. pp. 571-573

or her own child (provided she is not pregnant) 642 . Yaj IJ 
282 provides death by being burnt with the fire of straw for those 
who set fire to growing crops, houses, forests, village, pastures 
and threshing floors or who approach the queen Mar. (parusya, 
verse 31) prescribes that one who strikes with a weapon the king, 
even though the latter be at fault, should be impaled and roasted 
in fire. These examples are enough to convey an idea of the 
crimes for which the sentence of death was provided in some of 
the ancient smrtis. Manu "Vm 272, War (parusya 24), Visnu 
Dh. S. V. 24 prescribe the pouring of boiling oil in the mouth 
and ears of a sudra who through insolence tries to expound 
dharma to brahmanas. Cutting off limbs as a punishment 
(particularly hands and feet or fingers) was common in 
the case of thieves, pickpockets and cut-purses (Manu 
IX. 276-277, Nar., parisista verse 32, Taj IL 274 ). Excision 
of the tongue was the sentence when a sudra abused a brah- 
mana or a ksatriya by falsely charging him with some 
grave sin (5p. Dh. S. JX 10. 27. 14, Manu VHL 270, 
Narada, parusya 22 ), when a sudra loudly repeated the Veda 
along with twice-born persons (Gaut XH.4), when a person 
abused the king (Nar., parusya 30), when a person repeatedly 
proclaimed what was disliked by the king or divulged the secret 
policy of the king ( Yaj. IL 302 ). Excision of the male organ 
was prescribed for a sudra who sexually approached a woman or 
the three higher varnas ( Gaut XIL 2 ), for any one guilty oi 
the rape of another's wife ( Vrddha-Harlta VH. 201 and also 
confiscation of all property), for anyone guilty of incest or 
intercourse with mot her, mother's sister, pate waljunt^Bister,

higher varna (Nar., stripumsayoga73-75) The nose, the ears and 
the hands were cut off in the case of an offender guilty of ^elhng 
false gold or forbidden flesh such as that of a dog ( Yaj. IL 297 ). 
For branding, vide Gaut. XSL 44, Baud. Dh. S. 1. 10. 19, NSr. 
(sahasa 10), Manu XL 237 (=Matsya 227. 16), Visnu Dh. S. V. 3-7. 
The Dandaviveka(p. 47 ) states that branding was to be resorted 
to if the proper penance was not performed and if the offence 
was intentional. Yaj IL 202 provides branding for a gambler 
using false dice and (H. 294) for persons of the three higher 
varnas having intercourse with a very low caste woman and 
DaksaVH 33 prescribes it for an ascetic giving up his duties. 
The Kajataranginl mentions ( YL 108-112 ) that king Yasaskara 
(939-948 A. D ) of Kashmir branded on a brahmana's forehead the 
mark of dog's foot. Kesavapandita in his Dandanlti-prakarana 
( p. 6) quotes the author of the Vaijayanti (Nanda-pandita) to the 
effect that the making of marks was to be effected with the juice 
of the marking nut in the case of brahmanas and with a red-hot 
iron salaka in the case of others In England about a hundred 
yeaTs ago branding for desertion from the army was practised. 
Manu VUL 370 prescribes the shaving of the head as a punish- 
ment for a woman who pollutes a maiden, Uar. (sahasa 10) pres- 
cribes it for a brahmana who is not sentenced to death on account 
of his caste, Sankha-Likhita (q. by Apararka p 807) for one who 
abuses officers, brahmanas and elders. Megasthenes ( Fragment 
XXFVIL p. 72 ) notes ' If one is guilty of a very heinous offence 
the king orders his hair to be cropped, this being a punishment 
to the last degree infamous '. Imprisonment for life is prescrib- 
ed by Visnu Y. 71 for striking out both eyes of a man and by 
Sukra IV". 1. 88 (for repeating an offence more than three times) 
For imprisonment with labour, vide Sukra IV. 1. 92 and 108-109.

4. 10. 19, Yajf. H. 270 ). It was often associated with branding. 
Banishment is also prescribed by Yaj I 339 for officers faking 
bribes (and also confiscation of all wealth), for a porrorcd 
brahmana witness (Ysj IL 81), for one who embezzles the money 
of a corporation or transgresses the conventions agreed 
upon by a guild or village &c (Yaj. H. 187, Mann VUL 
319, Vismi Dh S. y. 167-16S ), for playing with false dice 
( Yaj, H. 202 and STar., dyutasamshvaya 6), for a brahmana 
guilty of very heinous offences *** (&inti 14 116) Sukra 
(IV. 1.98-108) contains a long list of offenders that deserve 
to be sentenced to banishment. Confiscation of all property 
was the punishment for several offences such as the commiss- 
ion of the makapatakas by persons other than brahmanas, 
provided they committed them unintentionally {Mann IX. 242), 
for perjury, for taking bribes by saWii/as ( Vismi Dh. S 
V. 179-180) 2ter (prakfrnafca 10-11 ) provides a humane rule 
that even when the king orders the confiscation of all the 
property of an offender he should not deprive the offender 
of the tools of his trade or the tools of his craft, such as amis 
in the case of a soldier, materials of art in the case of artisans, 
ornaments of courtezans, musical instruments of musicians 
Sankha-Likhita* 45 quoted by Y. B p 656 contain a similar 
provision Enhanced punishment was prescribed for committ- 
ing an offence again. Visnu Dh. S. UL 93 holds that a king

offence (though a first offender may be let off with a mere 
admonition). Kant. IV. 10 states that when a person is a first 
offender as to theft at a holy place or as a pickpocket or house- 
breaking from, the roof, his thumb and index finger may be cut 
off or he may be fined 54 panas, for a second offence all fingers 
may be out or a fine of 100 panas may be levied ; for a third 
offence the punishment is cutting of the right hand or a fine of 
400 panas and for the fourth death in any way the king may 
direct Manu IX. 277, Yaj II. 274, Visnu Dh. S. V. 136 contain 
a similar rule Vide Ap Dh. S. II. 10. 27. 11-13 for adultery. 
If several people conspire together and kill or injure a single 
man the punishment was to be double of what a single man 
committing the same offence would receive ( Kaut. HI. 19, Yaj. 
H.221, Visnu Dh. S. V. 73). Ab indicative of the superstitions 
of ancient (and even modern) times punishment for witchcraft 
may be mentioned. Kaut. IV. 4 prescribes 616 the employment of 
spies to find out those who profess to use charms for securing 
illicit love and banish them and adds that persons who are engag- 
ed in witchcraft to injure others may be similarly dealt with. In 
the times of the Peshwas wizards 647 and raisers of ghosts appear 
to have been frequent and were severely dealt with by the peo- 
ple themselves by being put to death, but the State generally 
confiscated the property or cut off the alleged wizard's finger. Up 
to the beginning of the 18th century even in England wretched 
old women were frequently convicted as witches and hanged " 8

Maim IX. 390 (=Matsya 227. 183) prescribes the very mild 
punishment of the fine of 200 panas for all incantations intended 
to destroy life, for magio rites and various kinds of raising 
ghosts and goblins. Medhatithi and Kulluka say that if the 
magio rites are successful the punishment would be that for 
murder. Br. (S B E. vol. 33 p. 361 verse 16 ) provides banish- 
ment for those who practise incantations with roots. 

Eaut. in II 5 prescribes 6i9 that a jail should be constructed 
in the capital provided with separate accommodation for men 
and women kept apart and well guarded at the entrances. He 
further provides 6S0 that among the duties of the nSgaraka is to 
let out of the jail on the day of the festival of the birth con- 
stellation of the king and on the full moon day (of every 
month) such persons as are young, very old, suffering from 
diseases and helpless, or those who are charitably disposed may 
pay the fines or others bind themselves by an agreement to pay 
in cash the fines for the offences for which the prisoners are jailed 
(and then the prisoners may be released). The persons jailed 
may be set free on their working every day or once in fiv a 
days or by undergoing corporal punishment ( whipping &o. ), 
paying fines in oash. Prisoners may be released from jail 
( as a favour ) on the conquest of fresh territory or on 
the coronation of the Crown Prince or on the birth of a son 
to the king. In the Delhi Topra Pillar Edict No. IV ( Corpus 
£ I vol. I. P. 123 and E. I. vol. H. pp. 253-54 ) Emperor Asoka 
promulgates that he gives three days' respite to prisoners on 
whom judgment has been passed and who have been condemned 
to death and in the 5th Pillar Edict of Delhi Topra (Corpus J. 1 
vol I p. 126-128 and E I. vol. D. PP 258-2 M ) he says tot 
L let off prisoners 25 times in 26 years ( which is m conform**

that was called Hell-piison of Asoka ( vide Watters, vol. H. 
pp. 88-90 ). Manu IX 388 requires that all jails should be so 
built as to abut on the royal road -where the offenders suffering 
pain and in bad condition would be seen by all ( in order to 
deter others from committing offences ). The Silappadikaram, 
one of the earliest works in Tamil, mentions the release of 
prisoners on the king's birthday and at the founding of a 
temple (pp. 38-39 of Mr Dikshitar's translation ). Kalidasa 
in the Malavikagnimitra 6sl (Act IV) makes the Vidusaka 
report to the king, 'the astrologers think that, as the constellation 
on which Your Majesty was born is in evil aspect now, let all 
prisoners be released '. Kalidasa ( in Raghu 17.19) alludes to 
the release of prisoners and the commutation of death sentences 
at the time of the coronation of king AMthi. The Brhat-Samhita 
(47-81) states that when the king takes the Pusyasnana 
( ceremonial bath on the day on which the moon is in conjunc- 
tion with the Fusya constellation in the month of Pausa or 
every month ) he may order release except as to those prisoners 
who were convicted for offences connected with his own person 
or with the harem. 652 In the Mrcchakatika (Act X) also various 
occasions for the release of prisoners are mentioned by the 
executioner. The Harsacarita 6S3 (E. 2nd para) refers to the 
usage of releasing prisoners at the time of a coronation and 
on the birth of Harsa (IV. ). The prisoners ate described 
in the latter passage as having long beards and as darkened 
by the accumulation of dirt on their bodies. 

Manu IX. 243 enjoins upon the king not to appropriate to 
himself the property of a man guilty of the mahapatakas ( by 
way of fine or confiscation) and warns that if he takes it out 

»!/?/? K ted V *" gnUt rf the offender. Manu ( IX 
244-45) recommends that such fine may be cast into water as 
an offermg to Varuna ( the Lord of waters ) who wields sceptre 
even over kings or may be bestowed on l eatned and virtuous

brahmanas, that are lords of the whole world Manu (IX. 
246-247 ) further states that in the country where the king 
avoids taking the property of very wicked sinners men become 
long-lived, crops spring up, there is no infant mortality &c. 

Generally no one was allowed to take the law into his own 
hands except as to recovery of debts ( which will be discussed 
below). ButNar. (parusya 654 11-14) contains the following 
remarkable passage : ' If a ivapalca, a meda, a ccmtjala, one devoid 
of a limb, one gaining livelihood by killing animals, an 
elephant driver, vratya (i. e. deprived of caste for non- 
performance of iipntiayana), a slave, one who disregards hiB 
elders or spiritual teacher — if these should transgress the limits 
they must observe towards their superiors, they should be punish- 
ed then and there by the person offended and the person so doing 
is not regarded as committing an offence (equal to theft) Should 
any such low person insult another ( who is his superior) that 
man himself shall punish him and the king has nothing to do 
with the punishment. These people are like the refuse ( dregs) 
of humanity and their property also is impure. The king is 
entitled to inflict bodily punishment ( whipping ), but he should 
not inflict fines on them \ The Mit. on Yaj. H. 370 quotes a text 
of Vrddha-Manu of similar import and explains that the words 
' the king should avoid taking fines ' refer to cases of grave 
offences 6SS . 

Something must be said about the law of Limitation. In 
the smrtis and digests rules of Limitation play very little part 
for several reasons. As on spiritual grounds, which will be set 
out under the title of rnadana, not only the debtor, tot also hw 
sons, grandsons and great-grandsons were liable to pay a debt 
( Mit on Yaj. H. 50 ), there was no scope at all for prescribing any 
period of limitation so fax as recovery of debts was concerned 
Unpaid purchase money was treated as a debt. In other matters

Nar IV 79 and others state that enjoyment of 
immovable property in the presence of the real owner 
•without protest from him causes loss of ownership 
and ten years' enjoyment of movables under similar 
circumstances leads to the same result. There are 
various views on the subject which have already been 
indicated above ( on pp. 322-325 ). 
2. An exception to the above rule is stated to he that no 
limitation applies to pledges boundaries, deposits, and 
to the property o£ minors, idiots, the State, women 
and brahraanas learned in the Vedas. Vide Gaut XXL

3 As the rules about deposit are extended by Ear. 
( upanidhi verse 14) to articles borrowed or given to 
artisans for being worked, and to antMkUa, nyasa and 
pratmySsa, in the case of these also there would be 
ordinarily no bar of limitation. Vide Manu VJH.

there are dicta to the contrary. Marlci (q. in 8m II.

CHAPTER XVI 
CONTRACTS 

There are only three titles of law, viz. recovery of debts, 
the relation of husband and wife ( siripimisat/oga ) and partition 
of wealth (d&yabhaga) that are of importance to modern Hindus, 
since to a very large extent they are even now governed in 
these matters by the ancient Hindu Law as interpreted by the 
commentators. These three topics therefore have to be described 
in detail while other titles will not and cannot be allowed to 
occupy much space. In almost all smrtis and digests of Hindu 
Law rriadana (recovery of debts) is treated of first Therefore 
here also that subject will be taken up first. A good deal of 
the matter falling under the title of the relation of husband 
and wife has already been dealt with in the 2nd volume of the 
History of DhaTmasastra pp. 427-636. The topic of dayabhaga 
will be dealt with last of all, the other topics being' taken up 
in the same order as in Manu. Many of the vyaixdiarapadas 
sts concerned with the law of contracts in various aspects, viz. 
the contract of debt, of pledge or mortgage, of bailments, of 
sale, of partnership, of hire and Bervice. 

Our writers do not set out with an analysis of the con- 
ception of contract in general. They had before them the 
ancient 18 titles of law, many of which related to various kinds 
of contracts and therefore they take up one title after another 
in the order contained in Manu or in IS&rada ( as the Sm C n' 
p. 306 expressly says ). But it is not to be supposed that they 
did not evolve certain general principles about contracts They 
do say a good deal about the competence of persons to enter 
into contracts, about fraud vitiating all contracts, about 
damages for breach of contract &c. Similarly the dharma- 
testras do not lay down a general Code of rules applicable to 
all transfers of immovable property, nor do they treat of 
transfers by way of sale, mortgage or gift in separate sections 
What they have to say on these transfers is tacked on to some 
vyamharapada e. g. they speak about sales and exchanges of 

f^n 11 ^ n V5tn ^^ ayaand 8ta5 ™ 5da . about gifts under 
dattepradamka and about mortgages under rnadSna. As this 
work has to represent what the ancient law was like the same 



413 Htstory cf Dharmaiaslra [ Vol, 

arrangement has been followed here. Similarly the law of 
crimes is not to be found in one place. It is scattered under 
different titles of law such as vakparusya, dandaparusya, satiasa, 
strlsangrahana and steya ; nor is there a complete analysis of 
intention or motive or of the right of private defence, although 
all these subjects are briefly dealt with in the smrtis m different 
places 

A great deal has been said by ancient writers about what, 
persons are competent to enter into transactions (vyavahara) 
The Arthasastra ( in III. 1 ) KI has a lengthy disquisition on it- 
Briefly, it holds that dependent persons, minors, extremely old 
paople, those charged with grave sins, sanraJUsms, persons who 
are devoid of a limb and those who are addicted to vices ( like 
drinking and whoring ) are incompetent and agreements made 
with such people are invalid. Among dependent people Kautilya 
mentions a son when the father is alive (and manages the affairs), 
a father when he has a son (who manages the family affairs ), a 
brother who has left the family, a younger brother whose share 
has not been separated, a woman whose husband or son is alive, 
a slave or a hired servant. He Btates that these may enter into 
binding agreements if those on whom they are dependent 
authorize them to do so. Ha further says that contracts made 
by persons that are at the time of making them intoxicated 
or are under the influence of wrath or are distressed or 
are of unsound mind or under duress ( imprisoned or confined ) 
are invalid. Yaj (IL 31-32) concisely puts down the same 
propositions by saying that all transactions brought about Dy 
force or fraud should be declared (by the king) tc .be , un- 
enforceable, so also those entered into ^ women or the otto 
persons specified above or entered into at night, « »£ 
interior of the house or outside the town or village < , ma fores 
&c) or with one's enemy or by persons unconnected wrth or 
unauthorized by the persons who are to be bound ^ftj^ 
TWinu ( VIII 165 and 168 ) also declares that all HaDbB 
ggaS mggage, gift)brought about byforce^aud^

null and void. Nar. IV. 26-43 treat this subject^ ac- 
tively. Some of NaradaWicta are interesting. He says, ra 
this world three are independent viz. the king, the Vedic teacher 
and the head of the house in his own house (33). Wives, sons 
and slaves ate not independent; the head of the house has 
independent power as to what belongs to him by inheritance (34). 
Kit. (497) also prescribes that one should not give a loan to 
women, mioors or slaves. When the texts say that women are 
incompetent to make contracts, what is meant is that they 
cannot make contracts binding on their husbands or family or 
against tue family property. Women are not inherently in- 
competent to deal with their own separate property except that 
the husband has some control ( these matters will be discussed 
at length later on under etrldhana ). Another proposition laid 
down by Ysj H 33, NaT. IV. 97, Kat. (517) and others 6 * 1 is that 
in all transactions relating to a debt or any other title of law 
the last act is the deciding factor ; but in the cases of gift, 
pledge or purchase each prior transaction ( of gift &c. ) is of 
Buparior efficacy to the succeeding one. 665 ' 

After the establishment of British rule in India during about 
150 years numerous publications dealing with Hindu customs 
and usages and the Hindu law of debts, contracts, adoption, 
family rights, partition and inheritance have been published. It 
is impossible to give an exhaustive list of these nor is it neces- 
sary to do so. Most of them have now only an academic or 
historic interest. But a few of them must be mentioned for 
their worth, for purposes of study and foT a knowledge of the 
modern Hindu Law as administered by the British Indian courts 
They are : Bannerjee's ' Hindu Law of Marriage and stridhan ' 

663 The Vyavaharamatrka p 288 quotes five verses as from Kaundinya 
•which ate almost the same as Nirada IV. 29, 30, 39, 34, 40 respectively 
The learned editor does not notice this

665. For example, if A establishes that he lent a sum to E but if the 
latter establishes that he repaid the amount, this later fact of repayment is 
decisive of the dispute if A files a suit for recovery of the money. If A 
mortgages a field to B for a loan and then mortgages the same field to C, 
the mortgage of B, being prior is superior to that made in favour of C The 
same principle is laid down in section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act 
UV oflSS2).

The idea of the liability to pay off one's debts was developed 
in India in the most ancient times. In Bg VHI. 47. 17 
the poet exclaims * Let us drive away the evil effects of bad 
dreams as we pay off debts '. In Bg X 34. 10 (the gamblers 
lament) it is stated that the gambler, because he owes a 
( gambling ) debt, is afraid and approaches the houses of others 
at night, desiring wealth ' » This indicates that a debtor was 
afraid of being detained by his creditor in those days U- 
VBL 66 10 indicates that money-lenders made a stipulation to 
receive double of what they lent, ' Indra strikes by W^power

The Tai. S. (HL 3. 8. 1-2 ) uses the very word ' kuslda ', which 
occurs 671 in the Dharmasutras and Bmrtis ( for money-lending ) 
when it says, ' O Agni 1 whatever debt has not been paid back 
by me, the tribute that I owe to Yama, here do I make return 
of it ; may I be freed from that debt ! '. The Sat. Br. M. 4 3. 11

Pramaganda* occurring therein as ' one who is born of a family 
that is extremely usurious \ in Panini employs the technical 
word ' uttamarna ' ( creditor } in his sutra ' dharer-uttamarnah * 
(L 4. 35), he speaks of 'adhamamya' (the position of a 
debtor) in H. 3. 70 and the word 'pratibhu' occurs in 
Panini n. 3. 39, the word ' vrddhi ' ( interest ) in V. 1. 47. 
Panini (IV. 4.31) derives the words ' kusldika' and ' kusldikin ' It 
is noteworthy that Panini does not derive or mention the word 
vardhusika, which is employed by even Ap. Dh. S and Baud- 
Dh. S and which is derived by Katyayana ( the grammarian ) 
in Vartika 3 on Panini TV. 4. 30, in which Panini refers to such 
words as 'dvaigunika' or 'traigunika'which were applied to people 
that carried on the condemned methods of money-lending viz 
extorting twofold ot threefold of the money lent (the sutra 
is 'prayacchati garhyam' ). Brahma'naspati is spoken of as 'one

fcEveda it was a firm belief that men were under obligations b,

germ of the doctrine of the three religious and spiritual debts 
that a man owed to gods Manes (pUrs ) and sages 'whSepa 

T.u. S VI 3 10. d, Sat. Br. 1 7. %. 11 and Ait. Br. 33. 1 quoted m 
H, of Da vol ir. pp.270, 560 notes 621 and 1302 and above n 669) 
Gradually further universal obligations came to be added to 
this theory of spiritual debts The Adiparva ( 120. 17-20 ) holds 
that men owe four debts, viz the three vedic ones and the fourth 
to humanity in genoral ( which is paid back by goodness to all) 
and Anus£sana37. 17 raises them to five (adding brahroanas 
and guests to the well-known three )«". It appears to me that 
this theory of spiritual debts being already in the air, the same 
sanctity came gradually to be transferred to one's promises to 
repay monetary debts and cany out other secular engagements 
The word rna had been applied both to spiritual and secular 
debts. It is on account of this that the son was not only desir- 
ed for repaying the spiritual debt owed to one's ancestors, but 
he was also expected to free his father ( if the father could not 
himself repay the monetary debt ) from the liability he incurred 
to his creditor Nar. IV. 5-9 puts this clearly and most 
emphatically : " fathers desire to have sons for their own benefit 
thinking in their heart ' he will release me from liability to 
creditors and debtors ' (or probably 'from high or low debts' 
i. e spiritual and earthly debts ). Three deceased ( ancestors ) 
must be honoured ( by a man ) and he must subsist on three 
(descendants) that come after him. These (the first three) 
series of ancestors rely ( for repayment ) of their twofold debts 
( spiritual and secular ) on the fourth in descent If a man 
fails to pay on demand a debt or promised gift that sum (by 
the addition of interest ) goes on growing till it amounts to a 
hundred crores and when a hundred crores are reached he is 
born again and again in the house of his creditor as a slave 
in order to repay the debt ( by his labour ). If an ascetic or a

without discharging his debts, the whole merit due to his 
austerities and the perpetual tending of fire helongs to his 
creditors". 476 Kat. (551, 591) expresses the same idea hut 
adds that a dehtor who has not repaid money horrowed ma; he 
horn as a slave, a servant, a woman or a beast in the house of 
his creditor. It was this belief that led to the doctrine of the 
pious obligation of the son to pay off his father's debts even if 
he received no property from the father." 7 

Narada IV. 98 defines ' kusida ' m a rather obscure verse 
as ' the receiving ot money paid'in consequence of the original 
( amount advanced ) and the profit ( agreed to be paid } thereon 
and those are called ktuSdm who maintain themselves by this 
occupation '. Brhaspati ( S. B. E 33 p. 320 verse % ) derives 67 * 
kusida aB 'that is called kusida, which is taken fourfold 
or ( even ) eightfold without any qnalm (by a person) from

two verses :' a vSrdhusika (.usurer) is one who taking cheap 
grain lends it on condition of receiving a quantity of grain of 
high price and is condemned among the brahmavadivs (students 
of the veda ) Brahmana murder and usury were weighed in a 
balance ; the murderer of a brahmana rose to the top while the 
usurer trembled '. Here usury of the type of the one described 
in Vas. II 41 (and not all lending of money at interest) is 
condemned as a great sin Gaut. XII 36, Vas II 50, Kaut III 11, 
Manu VHL 140-141 and others declare it righteous ( dharinya ) 
moneylendiug when an 80th part is stipulated a:> the interest

Megasthenes (fragment XXVII B p. 72) states • ' The Indians 
neither put out money at usury nor know how to borrow, 'but 
he is under some misapprehension, for he again says ( p 73 ) 
' one who is unable to lecover a loan or deposit has no remedy 
at law. All the creditor can do is to blame himself for 
trusting a rogue '. 

Nar. IV. 1 states that the principal topics under the title 
of ryfiMna are seven- what debts must be paid and whatnot; 
by whom, where and m what manner ( they are to be paid ) ; 
and the rules about advancing the loan and receiving it back 
The- first five of these relate to the debtor and the last two to 
the creditor Brhaspati (S. B E. 33 p. 320 v i) says that 
interest (vrddlu) is described to be. of four kinds by some, of 
five kinds by others and of six kinds by still others Nar. ( IV 
103-104) names four kinds and defines them, -viz Amrt 
(interest that is stipulated hy the debtor himself ), kahka. 
( interest accruing and payable every month) Ampta (interest 
of apam oi quarter, panu to be paid every day wrthout jhe 
principal being liable to be reduced, whatever uteres may 
Lve been recovered), mhavrddhi (interest on ^V^J 
compound interest). Manu VHI 153 mention, .these ^and

Br. (S B E 33 p. 319 verse 1) states 68 * that the creditor 
should always advance a loan after taking an adequate pledge 
or a deposit (with a mutual friend) or a reliable surety and 
af t6r committing the transaction to writing or making the loan 
in the presence of witnesses. The interest may be either stipu- 
lated (lerta) at the lime of the loan or not stipulated (akrta), 
as indicated in Vianu VL 4. Taj. II 38 and Visnu Dh. S. 71 3

that double the interest stated above may be taken when there 
StS hedged to secure the debt. Yaj and Vyasa provide 
TjSSfethe proper one when Bome f n g is pl^d or 
mortgaged by way of security. Y«j. H. 37, Manu Till 143 
(SstelV- 100), Visnu Dli S VI. 2 provide an option that two. 
three, four or five per cent per month may be charged as inte- 
rest in the order of the Lamas™ ( i. e % per cent per montn for 
abrShmana debtor and so on) Yaj. 31 37 allows toe rate 
only if there is nothing pledged by way of security ^yasa 
(in Par M.ULp 321) provided that the monthly rate of inte- 
rest was &th of the principal lent when a pledge or mortgage 
was given as against the loan, &th when only a surety was 
offered and two per cent per month when money was lent on 
personal secmity. The Anusasanaparva 117.'Z0 condemns to 
Hell those who take exorbitant interest. Kant, prescribed 
( as stated in n. 688 ) fines for taking heavier interest than that 
allowed by Mm Kat ( 498 ) provides that if a debtor himself 
stipulates a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the sastra 
in times of difficulty ( in order to induce the creditor to part 
with his money ) that stipulated interest ' must be paid bat a 
rate of interest imposed by the creditor otherwise (by force &c. ) 
should not be enforced by the Court 6M It is probable that 
these rates are specified because of the economic conditions of 
those times which proved too much even for the ancient sages 
or different mercantile usages about interest prevailed in 
different countaes at different times, as expressly stated by 
Nar. IV 105-106 that 6s? these high rateb ( including eight per 
cent per month ) had to be paid aecoiding to the law merchant 
m different countries Manu VTB.'. 141 ( =Nar. IV. 100 ) holds 
that to take two per cent per month ( on unsecured debts ) is not 
improper In medieval times also the rate of interest was 
rather high e g interest at 35 per cent is said to have been

provides that those debtors who carry on trade by traversing 
dense forests and those who are sea-faring traders should 
respectively pay 10 per cent and 20 per cent per month and 
tbe Mit adds that these exorbitant rates are allowed because 
of the great danger of the loss of even the principal as the 
debtors may perish by ship-wreck or from the attacks of robbere 
and wild beasts. Manu VIII. 157 leaves the rate of interest in 
the case of seafaring merchants to those who are clever in 
these matters and who know the proper time and place Kaui 
( IU 11 ) states 688 that the prescribed ( dharmya) Tate of interest 
is 1$ pana per cent per month, but in transactions ( or in 
commercial usage } it is five panas per cent per month ( as the 
highest, it appears ), that those who traverse forests and those 
who carry on maritime trade should pay respectively ten and 
twenty per cent per month, that those who exceed or induce 
creditors to exceed these rates should be punished with the first 
amercement, tha,t each of the witnesses to such usurious transact- 
ions should be punished with half of the above fine 

Other rules laid down in the smrtis relate to the maximum 
that can be recovered by a creditor from a debtor at one time 
All are agreed that the creditor cannot reoover at one time 
from the debtor for principal and interest more than double ol

Yas. 11 44-47 says the maximum recoverable at one time in

maximum recoverable is to be only double of what is lent Kat. 
( 570-57-2 ) states 6 " that the maximum recoverable in the case 
of precious stones, pearls, corals, gold, silver, fruits, silk, wool 
is double of what is loaned; of oils liquors, ghee, raw-sugar and

The rule of what is called damduput in modern times express- 
ed laconically by Manu V1IL 151 and Gaut X1L 38 is this that 
' the amount of principal and interest recoverable ' at one time 
in a lump sum cannot be more than double of the money lent ' 
As a debt was recoverable not only from a man himself but also 
from his three descendants and as therefore there was practi- 
cally no period at limitation fOT bringing a faint for money 
lent, creditors had great temptations to allow interest to go on 
increasing Therefore the sages who condemned the profession 
of usury and particularly waiting long for the increase of 
interest 691 laid down that whatever the length of- time during 
which the principal was at interest and whatever the rate of 
interest might have been, the creditor could recover by suit in a 
lump sum only double of the money lent This acted as a great

check on the creditors' rapacity. Several propositions are laid 
down in the Mit., 6 * 2 the VyavaharamaySkha and other digests 
that graft exceptions on the general rule, and that flow from 
the interpretation of Manu VJH 151 in both readings. The 
first modification is that if interest is received every day, month 
or year and is not claimed in a lump sum at one time then the 
total interest received by a creditor may be even several times 
more than the principal lent Br. provides ( S B E. vol 33 
p. 321 verse 11 ) that every day interest or bodily interest and 
bhogalnblia may be taken by the creditor ( irrespective of the 
question of dvaignnya) as long as the principal is not paid 653 
(2) Farther, if after the interest has accumulated for some time, 
there is a Iresh agreement with the same debtor whereby the 
sum lent together with interest due is taken as the prinoipal 
and interest is agreed to be paid on the amount so arrived at, 
then the total recoverable after this fresh agreement may exceed 
double the original sum lent. Manu ( VEI 154-155 ) and Br 
( S. B. E vol. 33 p 331 verse 60 ) allow such a fresh agreement. 
But if the debtor does not make a fresh agreement then the rule 
of damdupat would apply. (3) if after the sum due to the 
creditor has become double of the principal lent, the creditor 
accepts another man as the debtor ( who takes the liability on 
himself), then the creditor may recover from the substituted 
debtor after the lapse of years an amount which may bB more 
than double of the sum originally lent (4) If the debtor pays a 
part of the principal or if the creditor makes a concession ( called 
•rtte' intheMit onYaj H 39) and reduces the total recover- 
able or if the debtor receives an additional amount of money 
(called 'seka' in the Mit ) and it is added to the . ongma 
amount borrowed and a fresh agreement is made ™T** 
parties to put the whole to interest, then the rule of damdupat 
would not apply

Bale of damdupat *25 



The rule of damdupat has been acted upon by the courts in 
India in modern times 6H . Though under the Transfer of 
property Act before its amendment in 1929 there was a conflict 
of decisions, since 1929 it is settled that the rule of damdupat 
does not apply to mortgages governed by the Transfer of 
Property Act. But the rule iB so reasonable and humane that 
the Decoan Agriculturists' Belief Act ( XVTL of 1879 ) Jtias made 
(by sec. 13) the rale of damdupat applicable to all agriculturists 
aB defined by the Aot, -whether Hindus or non-Hindus ; and the 
Bombay Agricultural Debtors Belief Act (of 1939), sec. 42, 
the Madras Debt Conciliation Act ( XI of 1936, sec. 16 ) do 
the same. 

A loan has to be returned on demand if no time is fixed for 
repayment or on the expiry of the time ( if one has been fixed 
by the'parties ) or when interest ceases on account of becoming 
equal to the principal ( Br. in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 3X8 verse 47 ) 
Interest Btops when on the debtor offering to pay the loan the 
creditor refuses to accept it and the debtor deposits the money 
in the hands of a third person (Gaut. S3L 30, Yaj. IL 44). 
With Yaj. H. 44 section 84 of the Transfer of Property Act ( TV. 
of 1882 ) may be compared. Vas. If. 49 states the remarkable 
rule that interest stops the moment the king dies and begins 
to run only afteT the coronation of the successor. ffls War. H 39 

694 Vide Balkrtshna v Gopal I L E 1 Bom. 73 ( where it was held 
that the rule of damdupat should not be extended to apply to the amount 
recoverable id execution of the decree of a civil court), Nanchand v

apply when the defendant is a non-Hindu ), Gopal v Gangaram I L. R 20

(S, B. E. vol. 33 p. 33) provides that do interest runs on the price of 
commodities, on wages, on a deposit, on a fine, on what has been 
idly promised ( to bards and the like ) and on the stake won in 
gambling, unless there is a special or express agreement to pay 
interest. « Eat, ( 508 ) has a similar verse, « but adds hides, 
crops, liquor, bride-price and suretyship debts to some of those 
mentioned by Nar Kaut (IE 11) provides that no interest 
runs where the debtor is" a person engaged in a Vedic sacrifice 
of long duration, or is suffering from a disease or is staying at 
his teacher'B house (gunikula) for study or is a minor or is a 
man without any substance As regards some cases where 
originally a thing is lent to a person out of friendship or 
because he asked a loan of it, Nar. ( IV. 108 ) and Est (502-505) 
lay down certain rules which are quoted in the Mit. ( on Yaj, 
IL 38 ) and other works Nar. ( IV. 108 ) prescribes 658 that no 
interest ever attaches to things loaned through friendship, 
unless there is an express stipulation to that effect; but even 
in the absence of a stipulation interest starts running after the 
expiry of six months. Nar. IV. 109 and Eat. (505) both lay 
down that a loan (of money or an article) made through friend- 
ship cannot begin to earn interest as long as no demand is 
made for its return. If the debtor refuses to return it after it 
is demanded interest begins to run at the rate of five per cent.

a person after taking a loan goes'to another 700 country without 
returning it even when pressed by the lender to return it that 
loan begins to acquire interest three months ( after demand ) ; 
(3) when the borrower of a thing does not return it even though 
he is pressed to return it, the king should make him pay 
interest from that day ( i. e. day of demand ), though it was not 
agreed upon, though he remained in the country and though 
he be unwilling to pay interest. The Madanaxatna says that 
in these cases where no interest is settled beforehand and 
where the texts do not specify the rate ( as Kat. 505-506 do 
viz. what is lent through friendship, a deposit, balance of 
interest, unpaid purchase money, if not returned on demand, 
begin to carry 'interest at five per cent per month ), the rate of 
interest would be the one stated by YaJ. H 37 (viz. l/80th

12 ) briefly deals with mi and after stating some rules eztends 
the principles of upamdh ( deposit ) and debt to it Menu TOT 
165 employs the word 'sdhamana' in the sense of 'mortgage '" 
According to Br.™ (S B E. vol. 33 p. 323 verse 17) an adhi is 
of four kinds viz. of movable property, of immovable property, 
gopija (to be kept in custody of the pledgee only), bhogya (to 
be enjoyed). Ear. IV. 124 first divides adhi into two sorts, viss. 
one that is to be redeemed within a certain time fixed (by 
apeement at the time of contracting the debt) or to be retained 
till the debt is paid off and Mr. IV. 125 again subdivides each 
of these two into gopya and bhogya. This latter division was 
known to Gaut. XTT. 32 Mam VEZ 143, Yaj E 59, KSt. (576). 
The subdivisions of adhi are made from several points of view 
viz. the nature of the property, the form of the pledge, the men- 
tion or non-mention of a period and the evidence to establish 
it. The Mit. on Yaj. DT 58 explains 706 that the first kind of 
adhi mentioned in Nar. IV. 124 contains the conditions that the 
money will be repaid at a fixed time and that if the money be 
not so paid at the time fixed the thing pledged or mortgaged 
will belong to the creditor. Yaj. H. 58 sets out three provisions 
viz. (1) when a time is fixed for payment, the thing pledged or 
mortgaged is lost to the debtor if the time fixed is allowed to 
pass without there being any repayment ( whether it be an adhi 
that is to be merely kept or whether it is one to be enjoyed); 
(2) but if no time be fired the thing given as security is not lost

to the debtor at all, when it is an adhi that is to be enjoyed; (3) if 
no time is fixed and the adhi is only to be kept (gopya) then it 
is lost to the debtor only if it is not redeemed even when the 
debt has grown to double of the principal by non-payment of 
the interest agreed upon. There is a period of fourteen dayB* 
grace after this, as stated by Br. (S. B. E 7W vol. 33 p 324, 
verses 27-28) that when the principal has been doubled or the 
stipulated period in the case of a pledge delivered for a certain 
time only has expired, the creditor becomes the owner of the 
pledge, after waiting for a fortnight during which the debtor 
may repay the debt and redeem his property. Gaut. XJJL 29, 
Manu VUL 143, Yaj. U 58, Visnu Dh S. VL 5 provide that an 
adhi which is mortgaged with the condition that the fruit or 
profits are to be enjoyed bears no interest nor can the creditor, 
even after keeping such an adhi for a long time, make a gift of 
it or sell it Medhatithi on Manu vTL 143 holds that a mort- 
gagee with possession who is to enjoy the produce cannot, by 
virtue of the last quarter of Manu VUL 143, make a sub-mortgage 
( called amoadki ). Kulliika on 708 the other hand says that it is 
common practice in all countries for a mortgagee to execute a 
sub-mortgage of land and the like and that Manu VEX 143 does 
not forbid it. Prajapati 709 ( q. by Par. M. HL p. 242 ) defines a 
deed of sub-mortgage: 'if the creditor pledges to another the thing 
already pledged to him for the same amount ( for which it was 
pledged to him) he should pass a fresh deed of pledge (or 
mortgage) and should hand over the former deed to his own 
creditor.' It appears that Bub-mortgages came to be recognized 
rather late. Bharadvaja states that if a sub-mortgage be 
effected without the mortgagor's consent, the mortgagee would 
lose his money.

430 Htstory of Dharmaiastra [Vol. 

The general rule was that an adhi ( whether of movable 
or immovable property) that was bhogya carried no interest 
but the profits were to be taken in lieu of interest ( vide Kat 
516 ) no and the debtor would in this case get back his property 
on paying the principal Kaut (HI 1%) states 711 that immovable 
property mortgaged may be such that it can be enjoyed only by 
expending labour over it or without expending one's own labour 
the creditor may enjoy the fruits or income thereof But as 
noted by Vyasa and Bharadvaja 71z the stipulation about a 
bhogya adhi may be that the income from the property is to be 
taken as in payment of the whole interest and part of the 
principal This latter is called sapratyaya-bhogyadh and the 
other variety where the income is taken in lieu of interest only 
is called apiatyaya-bhogyadh The Mit, on Yaj. H. 64 after 
citing a text of Brhaspati refers to these two varieties ( though 
it does not use these terms ) and adds that if the income is not 
sufficient to meet the interest wholly then the debtor may have 
to pay the principal and the unpaid part of the debt before 
redeeming his property. The Mit. ( on Yaj. IL 64 ) states that 
the appropriate name 'ksayadhi' is given by the people to 
what is called (above) as sapratyaya-bhogyadht Bharadvaja 
states that on taking an account ( where there is an agreement 
to apply the income towards interest and reduction of the 
principal ) if the creditor has been overpaid he is to restore the 
overpaid amount to the debtor and that if a portion of the 
principal remains unpaid the debtor has to repay it. 

If a man first mortgaged his property and then sold it,_ the 
purchaser took it subject to the rights of the mortgagee (Vasisflia 
quoted by Sm. C II. p 145) If a person executed a "»»****

donee would take one-third of the thing and the mortgagee and 
purchaser would Bhaie the remaining two-thirds in proportion 
to the money paid by each 713 . If a person was liable to pay 
several debts, some secured by a pledge or mortgage and some 
taken on personal seourity, the latter were to be paid first and 
redemption of the mortgage was to be ordered afterwards, 
according to Bharadvaja ( q. by Vy. Nir p. 245 ). 

The restriction that more money should not be taken from 
the sub-mortgagee than what was advanced to the mortgagor 
was for the benefit of the latter. The Par. M. (IILp. 242) 
provides that a sub-mortgage oan be made only when the amount 
due has risen to double the principal, but that if the owner 
consents a sub-mortgage may be made even before that con- 
tingency arises. 

Kat. ( 522 ) requires that an adhi becomes valid when such 
particulars as the boundaries of the field or house and the 
village (in which it is situated) are specified™. Kat. ( 518) 
further provides that a writing of pledge or sale or gift is 
superior to a similar transaction made in the presence of 
witnesses only. If the same field or other thing is mortgaged 
or pledged to two persons separately, Visnu Dh. S. V 185 715 and 
Br. (S.B.E.33p 326 verse 34) prescribe 716 that'th'o one who 
got possession first (without force) is entitled to preference' 
This shows that under ancient Hindu Law possession was nine 
points of law and that hypothecation without delivery of 
possession was known to Kat. and other smrti writers, even if 
earher smrtis did not recognise an hypothecation without 
possession. Taj.ll 60 and Nar. IV. 139 emphatically assert that 
a pledge or mortgage becomes perfect or effective only if there

is enjoyment and not otherwise. This is to be taken along with 
Yaj. H 23 and so the first in time shall prevail only if the first 
is accompanied with possession If a sale or mortgage be made 
before witnesses to one man and in writing to another, the 
latter prevails over the former 717 . If a debtor were to pledge 
or mortgage the same thing to another after pledging it to one 
and without redeeming the first debt, Visnu Dh. S. (V. 181-182) 
prescribed 718 the drastic measure of corporal punishment 
( whipping or imprisonment ) if the land mortgaged was a goatnm 
or more in extent or a fine of 16 suvarnas if it was less. Eat 
(517) in similar circumstances made the debtor liable to the 
fine imposed on a thief Eat. ( 519-521 q. in Sm. C, II pp 144- 
145 and V. P. pp. 240-241 ) states that in a competition between 
a document of pledge which does not give particulars of the 
thing pledged or which refers to a thing not existing at the time 
and a document in which the thing pledged is described with 
particulars or in which the thing existed at the time the deed 
was executed, the latter is entitled to preference; similarly the 
pledge of a thing specifically described is superior to a prior 
pledge of all the debtor's property mentioned in general terms 

H an adh, deteriorates 719 in value (i e. becomes inadequate 
to meet principal and interest) or if it be lost or destroyed 
though proper care be taken thereof by the creditor, then the 
debtor must either pledge another adequate thing { m substitu- 
tion ) or the debtor should return the amount due (YSj 11 W, 
Eat 524) The Mit on Yaj. II 60 remarks that it follows from 
this that it is the duty of the pledgee to take proper care of the 
thing pledged. Br. (8 B B 33 p. 323 verse 19) expressly says

S B E 33 p 323 verse 21). From the time of Gautama 729 (about 

500 B. ) onwards the rule about the care required of a pledgee, 

- bailee, depositee was the same viz that he is to take of another's 

property kept with him as much care as he would take of his 

own Nar. ( mksepa 14 ) and Yaj II 67 lay down the same rule 

for all kinds of bailments Manu VUL 189 ( =Nar., mksepa, 

verse 12) illustrates what is meant by accidental loss. 

The debtor cannot Tedeem the pledge or mortgage before 
the time fixed by mutual agreement, but by mutual agreement 
he can redeem even before (Br. S. B.E. p 325 verses 32-33 ). 
If the creditor does not allow redemption when the debtor has 
a right to redeem and is ready to do so, the creditor may be 
liable to be fined as a thief ( Yaj. II. 62 ). Ace. to Kant (BX 12) 
the fine ib 12 panas 721 . 

It has already been stated above (p 429) that in certain cases 
(ie. when it is a gopi/a adh) the ownership is lost to the mortgagor 
(i. e. in the language of modern law there is a foreclosure), if 
the amount has risen to double of the money lent without 
payment (even after the period of grace) or if the period fixed 
has passed away without there being repayment (-whether the

amount has risen to double of that lent or not, ace. to Mit on 
Yaj. IL 58) But if at the time of contracting the debt ttw 
stipulation is to repay the sum lent with interest and there is 
no stipulation about loss of the ownership of the thing mortgaged 
(i. e it is like a simple mortgage of modern times), then there 
is no loss of ownership There is then only a power of sale m 
the mortgagee So also in the case of a bkogijadlu the mortgagor 
or his heirs can redeem the property at any time by paying the 
principal and there is no loss of ownership to the mortgagor 
According io Taj II 63 and Br.* 22 (S B E vol 33 p 325 
verse 29 ) the creditor can sell in the presence of (the debtor's 
relatives) and witnesses the adhi, when the amount has grown 
to double of that lent or when the period fixed has passed, if 
the debtor has not redeemed and is absent or dead After 
meeting his own dues the creditor has, as said by Eat. 529, to 
hand over the balance of the sale price to the king ( i e pro- 
bably to the court of the locality) Kaut. 73 (HL'12) provides 
that if the debtor is present and the creditor is afraid of the 
loss of his money because it may exceed the market value of 
the adhi he may sell it with the permission of the judges 
(dharmastha) or he may demand a surety for assurance It 
appears from these passages that a sale through court and a 
right of private sale were both recognised in the case of mort- 
gages in ancient India (as in modern times under sections 65 
and 69 of the Transfer of Property Act). 

There were two other special kinds of adhi described in 
Yaj. H. 61 viz. auitrabandhaka 7 * and saty ankara. The first

occurs either when the creditor being known to be very honest 
the debtor gives as security a property of veTy great value for 
a small debt or where a debtor being known to be very honest 
a property of very small value is^ accepted as security for a 
large debt. In such a case there is no forfeiture or foreclosure 
of the property in any case but the king (or judge) should 
award only double the principal lent Another meaning is that 
in a, cantmbandhaka it is the merit (apurva or punya) arising 
from bathing in the Ganges or from performance of agmhatra 
that is given as security (i. e. he will forfeit merit on non- 
payment). In this case the creditor will receive double and 
there is no loss or forfeiture of adhi. A pledge made with 
salyaftkaia occurs when at the time of making a pledge the 
stipulation is 'I am liable to pay only double but there will be 
no loss of the thing pledged' or (a second meaning of) satyan- 
kara^Bthat 'when an earnest (a ring or the like) is given at 
the time of a sale and the vendor breaks 'the promise he has to 
pay double of the earnest*. 

If the mortgagee is dead or absent abroad, and the debtor 
wants to redeem he may take back the adhi after paying the 
amount due to the family i. e. to his sons and other agnatic 
relations or to his cognates and in the absence of these (if the 
creditor be a brahmana) to other brahmanas (and ifnobrsh- 
manas be available) he may cast the money into water ( Yaj 
JX 62 and Nar. IV. 11S-113 ) The Kausika-sutra *« ( 46. 36-40 ) 
contains provisions about casting the debt in the cemetery 
or where four roads meet if the creditor is dead and there are no 
heirs. The Sangraha says that it may be thrown into water with 
a palasa leaf to the accompaniment of Tai S.IH. 3 4 1-2 quoted 
above ( n 671) Another alternative is that the debtor may have 
a valuation of the adhi made at the time when he wants to 
redeem (and the creditor is absent), and allow it to remain with

( IL 3. 39 ). Suretyship requires the concunence of three persons 
viz. the creditor, the horrower (called the principal debtor) and 
the person who agrees, for inspumg confidence in the creditor'*, 
to pay or indemnify if the principal debtor commits default 
Manu VUL 160 speaks of surety for appearance and for repay- 
ment of debt. According to the purpose of the transaction a 
surety is of three kinds (Yaj. IL 53 =Visnu Dh. S VI 41 and 
Nar. IV. 118 ) viz for appearance, for payment and for honesty 
The first undertakes to produce a person before a court and 
assures the court that ■ the person concerned will not abscond 
from the country ; the surety for payment agrees that in case 
the debtor does not pay the principal and interest, be will him- 
self pay both; the surety for honesty assures the employer or 
other person with whom another man deals that the latter is an 
honest and good man, that he would not deceive and that re- 
liance may he placed on him ( 7ide Mit. on Yaj II 53 and Sm. 
CEp 148 for these explanations). Br (S. B. E ™ vol. 33 
p. 327 verses 39-40) speaks of four (including the three of Yaj 
II. 53), his fourth being one who promises to deliver or restore 
the assets that are with the debtor (such as household furniture 
or ornaments). Y§j. and Ear. must be deemed to include this 
last under the surety for payment. Kat. (530) 728 says that a 
surety (lagnaJca) may be caused to be given for repayment (of 
a debt), for appearance {upastMna), in lawsuits, for honesty 
and for taking oaths (or ordeals). Ace. to Harlta a surety w

for honesty, for repayment of debt, for deliveriug the debtor's 
property to the creditor, for appearance "V. P. p 248 quotes 
Vyasa (who mentions seven kinds of sureties) and remarks that 
all can ultimately be Teduced to three varieties. 

If the surety for appearance cannot produce the person at 
the time and place agreed upon, he should in that case pay to 
the creditor what he has bound himself to pay except where the 
debtor is prevented from appearing by act of God or of the 
king. But a period of a fortnight, a month or three fortnights 
at the most should be allowed to the surety to find out the 
absconding person 72 '. If he can produce him within that time 
the surety would he free from liability ( Kat 531, 533, Br. in 
S. B E vol 33 p. 327 verse 42 ). If the surety for appearance 
cannot (even after time is given) produce the debtor or the 
debtor dies then the surety has to pay from his own pocket the 
money due from the debtor (Manu VIIL 158 and Kat. 532-33 ). 
All this is subject to the proviso of the act of God or of" 
the king. 

Sureties of all kinds are personally liable to make good 
the loss arising from the non-appearance of the debtor, or from 
his dishonesty or non-payment (Yaj. IL 53, Visnu VI 41, Br. in 
S B. E 33 p. 327 v. 41); hut the sons of the surety forappea- 
rance or honesty were not liable, if the surety died 730 . Yet if the 
surety for appearance or honesty stood surety only after taking 
some security from the debtor for so doing, then even the son 
would be liable to reimburse from such security the person

(Yaj II 55, Nar. IV. 120) Kat 538 states 731 a special rule 
that whichever out of several sureties that have incurred joint 
and several liability is found present at the place (of the 
agreement) should be made, to pay the debt, if such a surety 
has gone abroad his son may be made to pay the whole, but if 
the surety be dead the son should be made to pay only the share 
of his"father (there being several sureties) If a surety being 
pressed or harassed by a creditor pays openly (before all people) 
the debt (wholly or in part) 732 then the debtor will be made to 
pay after three fortnights double of what the surety has to pay 
( Yaj II 56, Nar. IV. 131, Visnu Dh S. VI 44, Kat 539) But 
if the surety pays without being pressed he - would get only 
what he paid and if the debtor reimburses the surety without 
loss of time then he has not to pay double These rules apply 
to money lent, but in the case of grain, clothes and liquids the 
debtor must pay to the surety three, four or eight times respec- 
tively ( Yaj II 57 ) Who could not he accepted as sureties has 
already been stated ( on pp. 291-292 ). 

Several were the modes of the recovery of debts Manu 
(VEIL' 47-48) requires the king to make the debtor repay his 
debt to the creditor in whatever way he can do it There is a 
difference in the modes of recovery according as the liability is 
admitted by the debtor or not. If liability is denied then the 
only method is to file a suit for the recovery of the debt. But" tne 
liability is admitted by the debtor, then Manu VHI 49 (=»ar iv 
122), and Br (S B E vol 33 p 329 v. 54 ) mention five means of 
recovery viz dham* (persuasion), njavahara i^P^

dated samoat 1198 (1141-42 A D.) this practice is called kaya-vrata 
(tyorfi brahmanahTcoyavialam Mm mrvyate). Vide E. L vol. XI p. 37 
atp 40 These modes of recovery except vyavabara are explained 
by Brhaspati as follows : m The method of dbarma consists in 
sending messages ( to the debtor ) from his friends and rela- 
tives, in persuading him to pay with sweet words, by following 
the debtor (i e. by persistent dunning) and by frequent requests. 
Trick consists in the creditor borrowing from the debtor some 
ornament or other article under the pretext of its being required 
in a festival and not returning it or in retaining what the 
debtor has handed over to the creditor for being delivered to 
another , that is compulsion when the debtor is brought to the 
creditor's house, is then confined or beaten and thus induced to 
repay the debt ; that is acatifa where the creditor keeps tied 
his own wife or son or cattle at the debtor s house or sits down 
at his door (fasting 1 Ail these methods could not be employed 
in the case of all debtors Kat. ( 477-480 ) has already been cited 
(on p. 383) to show how the king is to employ the various methods 
in the case of brahmanas, traders &c. If the creditor employs 
any one of the methods ( other than vyavahaTa ) and harasses 
a debtor when the latter claims judicial investigation and there 
is a doubt or dispute between the two as to the amount, the rate 
of interest, the liability to pay, the creditor would lose his 
claim and would have to pay a fine equal (to the claim) 734 
Kat 589 and Br ^ < S. B E vol 33, p. 331 verses 63-65 ) lay 
this down But when the debtor admits his liability and yet 
does not pay and when the creditor therefore employs one of 
the means (other than a suit) appropriate to the caste and 
position of the debtor, then, if the debtor complains to the king

husband's debt, but wives of cowherds and those who take a lease 

of lands for half produce may be arrested for non-payment by the 

husband. As compared with the harsh legislation against debtors 

in most ancient and medieval systems of jurisprudence the rules 

laid down by the smrtis are very mild and humane 739 . If there 

were several creditors there was priority among them i. e. the 

earlier debt prevailed over the later one; a brahmana creditor 

however ( whatever the date of his advance) was preferred to a 

ksatriya or other creditor (Yaj H. 41, Kat. 514). Kaut 740 states that 

the debts owed to the Crown and a srotriya take precedence over 

other debts -and that unless the debtor is going to abscond 

several creditors should not simultaneously proceed against one 

debtor. Section 56 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code makes 

Government assessment a paramount charge on the land. But 

ace. to Kat. ( 513 ) if several debts were contracted in writing 

on the same date, they should all be treated as equal and paid 

off pro rata from the debtor's assets if insufficient ; but, if a 

creditor established that a particular article belonging to a 

debtor was manufactured by the debtor with his money only, 

that creditor alone got the money recovered by sale of the 

article ( Kat. 515 ). Bharadvaja states 741 that if a debtor has no 

cash then the creditor should be paid by sale of the debtor's 

other property in order viz. grain, gold, iron, cattle, clothes, land, 

slaves, and conveyances, ( in the absence of fields ) his garden 

and lastly his house and in the absence of even a house time 

should be granted to debtors of the three higher castes. 



739. Under the law of the Twelve Tables m Rome a creditor could put 
the debtor to death or sell him to a stranger beyond the Tiber or, if there 
were several creditors, they could divide the body of the debtor among them- 
selves after the third market day (Table III In Ortolan's Roman Law p 106).

442 History of Dliantiaiastia [ Vol, 

When a debtor was not able to return the entire debt in a 
lump, he should write on the back of the document of debt the 
sums paid by him from time to time or the creditor may pass 
a receipt (upagata or piaveiapatia, as the Mit designates it) to 
the debtor signed by himself (Yaj II 93, Nar IV. 114,Visnu 
Dh S VI 26 ). If the creditor, though requested by the debtor, 
would not pass a receipt he was to lose the balance of his debt 
(Nar. IV. 114) Nar. IV 115 and Br (SB E vol 33 p 332 
verse 66 ) further provide that if the creditor does not write 
down (either on the bond itself or in a separate document) 
the money recovered by dliat ma or some other method then the 
debtor himself will be entitled to interest on the amount paid 
by him 741 « When the whole debt is paid off, the creditor 
should tear off the bond of debt or he may execute another 
document in order, to thow that the debtor is freed from the debt 
(if the original is lost or is not within easy reach) and when a 
debt is borrowed in the presence of witnesses, it should be re- 
turned in the presence of the same or other witnesses (Taj IL 
94,VisnuDh S. VI. 24-25) Nar IV 116 requires the creditor 
to return the document when the whole debt is paid off or to 
announce openly to others that it has been paid 742 

It has now to be seen who (other the man himself) are 
liable to pay a man's debt The liability to pay another's debt 
may arise on three grounds, fa) religious, (2) equitable and 
moral, (3) legal, such as agency (express or implied) or 
authority. That the sons and grandsons of the original debtor 
aie liable to pay on religious grounds the debt of ^father is 
expressly stated by numerous, writers such as Kaut ill . u, 
Y £.n 50. Nar. IV. 4, Br. (S. B. E vol 33 p. £28 verse 4 9),

IE \ Great-grandson's liability for debts 443 

The important question is whether the smrtis declare the liabi- 
lity of the great-grandson. It is clear that Bmttis like that of 
Br. expressly say that the great-grandson is not liable to pay 
his great-grandfather's debt. The Visnu Dh. S. VI. 28 says 
that the descendants beyond the grandson need not pay if they 
are unwilling to pay Others like Nar IV. 4 and Kat. say that 
the obligation to return a debt ceases from the fourth. The 
question is what is meant by the fourth i. e. is it meant to 
exclude, in calculating, the original debtor or to include him ? 
It is possible to hold (particularly because the great-grandson 
is not expressly mentioned in most smrtis) that the fourth 
means 'inclusive of the original debtor'. But this appears to 
he in conflict with the rule in Manu IX. 137 (which is the same 
as Baud Dh. S. H 9. 6, Vas. 17. 5, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 46) that the 
son, grandson, and great-grandson confer the greatest spiritual 
benefit on the ancestor, the rule (Manu IX 186, Nar. IV. 6 ) 
thatptt^os (in irBddha) are to be offered by three persons in 
descent and the general rule that whoever takes the inheritance 
must offer the pinda and pay the debts of the ancestor (Gaut. 
XE. 37, Yaj. H. 51, Har. IV. 23, Visnu Dh. S XV. 40 and VI 39). 
Therefore, following the canons, viz. the rights to property are 
co-extensive with the liability to perform sraddha and to pay 
off debts (which is quite logical and reasonable), that the 
texts relating to the same subject matter muBt be harmonized 
and reconciled as far as it is reasonably possible 71 * to do 
(ekuvakyatartiyaya), that apparently conflicting texts are to be 
assigned their appropriate spheres {msayauyavastha), and that a 
direct conflict (and so an option) is to be presumed only if no 
other recourse is open, the Mitaksara and other commentators 
put forward the interpretation that the texts stating that the 
great-grandson is not liable to pay the great-grandfather's debt 
apply only to cases where the great-grandson inherits no ances- 
tral property, but that he «s liable if he takes ancestral property

teaching of such an eminent authority as Vyiiammmi, who

he does not inherit his property* He makes similar remarks in 
his Tagore Law Lectures for 1885 (on 'adoption, partition' &o. 
p. 171 ). Dr. Jolly is under some misapprehension since the 
Mit. in two places deals with this matter and expressly states 
that the great-grandson is liable to pay debts contracted by his 
greatgrandfather if he has taken ancestral estate but not other- 
wise. The following propositions are deduoible from the smrti 
texts and authoritative commentaries like the Mit and the 
Vlramitrodaya ( VyavaharaprakSsa ). The 74S first proposition is 
that the debts of a man must be paid by his three descendants 
(son, grandson and great-grandson) if they have ancestral 
estate in their handB (Mit on Taj H. 51 quoted in note 745, 
Sm. Up 171, V. P. p. 264). The 2nd proposition is that 
even when no ancestral estate was taken by the descendants 
the son was liable to pay his father's debts with interest, the 
grandson wa§ liable to pay his grandfather's debt but without 
interest and the great-grandson was not liable to pay even the 
principal, if he was unwilling to pay. This proposition is 
enunciated by Visnu Dh S "VT 27-28, Br. ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328

746 The first proposition is followed by modern decisions in British 
India Vjde Lachmcm Das v Khutrnu 19 All. 26 (F. B ) which holds that 
the mortgagee of a man who had mortgaged joint ancestral property can 
enforce bis mortgage against the grandson of the mortgagor for the rela-

m ] Uabiltty of sons arid other descendants 445 

"v. 49 referred to on p. 443 ) and Kat. 556 w . In Narasmliarav v. 
Ardaji % Bom. H. C R. 61 it was held ( probably following Brhas- 
pati, though not quoted in the judgment) that the grandson was 
liable to pay the debt of his grandfather without interest even 
if there was no ancestral estate. This was felt to be a great 
hardship on heirs (taking no ancestral estate) and in order to 
remove it Bombay Act YH of 1866 (the Hindu Heirs* Belief 
Act) was passed whereby it is provided that a son or grandson 
is not liable to be sued for the debts of his deceased ancestor 
merely by reason of his being such a son or grandson and that 
the son, grandson or other heir shall be liable orfly to the extent 
of the assets that come to -his hands. The same is the law laid 
down in other parts of India by judicial decisions. Br. (S B. E. 
vol. 33 p. 328 verse 48) recommends thai the father's debt must 
be paid first of all and after that one's own debt ; but a debt of 
the grandfather must always be paid even before the prece- 
ding 748 two kinds of debt. These two propositions of Hindu 
jurists are very lucidly, but succinctly, set forth by the Vlra- 
mitrodaya quoted below 749 . The third proposition (whioh is an 
exception to the above two) is that even a son is not liable to 
pay certain illegal and immoral debts of his father This pro- 
position will be discussed a little further on A fourth proposi- 
tion is that even when the father is not dead, the son, grandson 
or great-grandson may be liable to pay the father's or other 
ancestor's debt under certain circumstances. Yaj. H. 50 pro- 
vides that sons (and grandsons) must pay the debt of the father 
when he is dead or has gone to a distant country or is afflicted 
with an incurable disease. Nar. 7 * IV. 14, V isrm YL 37, Kat.

44 <> History of Dliarmaiastra [ Vol. 

548-550 state that when the father, though living and near, 
becomes an ascetic (ace. to Visnu), is afflicted with such diseases 
or calamities as blindness from birth or loss of caste (due to 
grave sins), lunacy, tuberculosis, leprosy and other (incurable) 
diseases or when he has left his country or has gone on a long 
journey or is very old (above 80) the son will have to pay the 
debt of the father after the twentieth year (from his going 
abroad). Ace. to V. R. (p 50) if the father's disease was incu- 
rable or if it was certain that he would not return from his 
journey then the son was bound to pay at once and was not 
entitled to wait for 20 years Kat (552-553) introduces' 51 a 
further restriction that even when the father is dead, if the son 
has not attained years of discretion (i e. if he is a minor) he 
need not pay the debt of his father during his minority; but 
when the proper time to pay arrives he must pay the debt, 
otherwise the (ancestors) may remain in hell. Thus the son's 
liability during the father's lifetime or absence was not abso- 
lute but limited according to the smrtis and digests ; judicial 
decisions, however, have brushed all thiB aside and the sotfs 
liability to pay his father's debts during the latter's lifetime is 
now as absolute as after his death. This will be discussed 
further on. 

According to all smrti writers even the son, though he may 
have taken the ancestral estate, is not liable to pay certain 
debts of the father which are compendiously des0 ™f * s 
'illegal or immo ral 'in the decisions of courts. Gaut. A U-

andS.KlLr.IV. 10, Br. (S.B. E. vol. 33 p 329 Terse 51), Kat 
(564-565), Usanas and Vyasa provide that the son is not W 
to pay the following debts of his father viz. those incurred as a 
surety (for honesty or appearance), fox drinking or m gamb- 
ling, those arising from idle promises (to bards, wrestlers and 
the like), debts for promises made under the influence of wrath 
or illicit love to women, the balance of a fine or toll and those 
that are not vanmhanka. A debt arising from wrath is explai- 
ned by Kat as one where the father causes physical injury to 
another or destroys another's property through anger and then 
promises something to pacify the person wronged. As regards 
the suretyship debts of the father, Y&j. II. 54, Vyasa and Kat. 
(561) provide that when the father was a surety for payment, 
then the son was bound to pay the principal of the debt for 
which the father stood surety, but the son of the son was not 
liable at all to pay the suretyship debt of his grandfather even 
when the latter was a surety for payment ,S3 . These verses 
about the debts which the son was not bound to pay have been 
quoted and explained in numerous decisions of the courts. But 
as this work does not profess to be a treatise on modern Hindu 
Law those cases are passed over here. "What is meant by 
'debts that are not vyavaharika' has presented the greatest

is necessary to see how far these principles., agree with' or 
deviate from the law of the ^ smrtis and the digests. The first 
proposition is in consonance with the law of the smrtis and of 
the commentaries likejhe Mit. Taj. H. 45 -provides 756 that 
whatever debt is contracted by the head of the joint -family for 
the necessities of 'the 'family has to-be paid by the members 
who take the ancestral estate When the head is dead or goes to 
' a foreign country. The Mit. on YSj 31 114 quotes and explains 
a smrti text " Even one (the head or manager of a joint family) 
can make a mortgage, sale or gift of immovable property in a 
tim9 of distress, for the necessities of the family and particular- 
ly for religious and charitable purposes ". What is meant by 
' debts in times of distress ' and ' fcutumbsrthe ' is explained by

of numerous cases, the first and the most important of which is

above also follows from several smrtis (such as Yaj. & 5r 
Visnu Dh S. VI 35, Nar. IV. 2, 4, 6) and the rule B abou 
immoral debts cited above. But it is difficult to understate 
why the Privy Council make a distinction between a simple 
personal -money debt of the father and a debt secured by- 
mortgage ( as in propositions 2 and 3 ). The ancient texts and 
commentaries make no Buoh distinction. Vide 42 Mad 711 at 
p. 731, 26 Bom. 206 at pp. 217-B19 (F. B.) and 60 Bom. 311 (P. B.. 
where this is pointed out. With the greatest respect it must 
be said that the distinction is not only without dharmasSstra 
authority, but is also - anomalous. The distinction between 
' antecedent debt ' and a debt contracted at the time of execut- 
ing a mortgage is unknown to the smrtis or digests. The 
Privy Council had used for the first time in a very early case 
( viz. Suraj Bunsi v. Sheo Proshad 6 L A. 88 at p. 106 = 5 Cal. 
148, 171) the words 'antecedent debt' 758 for which there is 
nothing corresponding in the Sanskrit authorities and round 
which elaborate arguments came to be centred in numerous 
later oases According to the Privy Council (proposition 5) 
the son's pious duty "to pay his father's debt is as absolute 
during the father's lifetime as after his death. It has been 
shown above that the duty was not absolute but qualified and 
limited during the father's life according to the smrtis. 

Yaj. H. 52, Kaut. (HI 11) provide 759 that husband and 
wife, father and son and brothers cannot, as long as they 
are undivided, stand sureties for each other or be debtors 
and creditors of each other or be witnesses *"•»*«« 
The Mit. has a long note on Yaj. H. 52. It shows that a jffe

theft *. The Mit. explains that the absence of division between 
husband and wife is restricted to religious rites performed with 
irmrta fires or smarto fire and in the rewards of meritorious acts 
and not in all actions or as to all property. Therefore in other 
charities where no sacred fire is required (purta acts such as 
constructing a well or a public park ) they have separate rights. 
Vide S. V. pp. 353 for various explanations of Bhaxuchi and 
others on £p. Dh. S. and V. P. pp. 255-56. 

The father is not bound to pay his son's personal debt ; the 
husband is not liable to pay the wife's debt, nor the wife her 
husband's or son's But in all these cases if the debt is incurred 
for the benefit or purposes of the family by the son, the wife or 
the husband then the father, husband or wife respectively would 
be liable (Yaj JL 47, Nar. IV. 10-11, Kat. 545, 579 J* 1 . H the 
father promised to pay his son's individual debt or if he appro- 
ved or acquiesced in it he was liable to pay it. Manu VTTT 167 
Yaj IL 45, Nar. IV. 12, Br. (S. B. K 33 p. 329 v. 50), Kat. (545 ) 
provide that a debt incurred for the purposes of the family by 
any one such as the son, brother, uncle, the wife, the mother, 
the pupil or a servant or a slave even without the consent of 
the head of the family when he has gone abroad, should'be paid 
by the head of the family. This liability and the liability when 
the manager of a family contracts a debt for the benefit or neces- 
sities of the family arise from agency (implied) or authority. 
Kaut. (HL 11 ) holds that the husband may be seized (for work)

The general rule that the husband was not liable to pay the 
wife's debt had an exception viz the husband was liable for the 
debts of the wife in the case of cowherds, vintners, actors, 
washermen and hunters ( and the like ) whose income depends 
on their wives and whose household expenses are defrayed by 
their wives (Yaj IL 48, Vi&mi Dh S VI. 37, Nar IV.' 19) 
Similarly the rule that the wife was not liable for the husband's 
debt had certain exceptions, viz a debt of the husband which sho 
promised to pay because he was dying or going abroad or whiob 
was contracted jointly with her husband' 63 ( Yaj II 49, Nar 
IV 16-17 ) The Mit. on Yaj. IL 49 answers the objection raised 
by some that, as according to Manu VEI. 416 ( =TJdyogaparva 
33. 64) the wife, son and slave are without property and whatever 
they earn is acquired for him to whom they belong, the wife 
would not be able to pay anything at all The reply is that 
this verse of Manu does not mean that a wife or son can own no 
property at all, but all that it declares is that they have no 
independent power to dispose of their property. 

The order in which persons are liable to pay a man's debts 
after his death is declared by Yaj IL 51, Nar IV. %&, Br. ( S B B.

and moral principle that whoever takes the weal f,°* 
fte Zmi or his widow (over whom the debased i^M 
a sort of dominion) was bound to 'pay his debts There 
ap^ars to be some conflict between- the' tart. ; but it is more 
apparent than real Verses (like Kat 577 ) where the son 
is Placed after the taker of wealth and before the taker of the 
widow refer to a son who has separate and independent wealth 
of his own and is more wealthy than the taker of the widow 
(though he himself being disqualified did not succeed to, 
ancestral wealth) When there is no wealth and there are 
several sons one of whom is congenitally blind or otherwise 
incompetent to succeed then the other sons are liable. From 
the fact that the taker of the widow is made liable for the debts of 
the first husband it should not be supposed that the ancient sages 
approved of widow-remarriage. On the contrary they condemned 
it ( vide Manu V. 162 ), but, as tbe Mit. ( on Yaj. JL 51 ) remarks, 
remarriages took place by custom among certain castes and 
nothing could prevent persons from taking widows as kept 
mistresses Therefore as the wife was half of, the husband 
( ace. to Vedic and other passages q. in H. ofDh. vol H pp. 428, 
584 n. ) she was practically the husband's wealth ( Nar. IV, 
%% expressly says so ) 76S and so the taker of the widow was 
saddled with the obligation to pay the debts of the deceased. 
This sentiment continued to modern times and in the Bombay 
Presidency the Legislature had to declare (by Bombay Act VII 
of 1866, sec 4 ) that ' no person who has married a widow shall 
merely by reason of such marriage, be liable for any of the 
debts of any prior husband of Buch widow '. The Vaijayantl 
on "Visnu Dh. S. VI 30 quotes Yaj. It. 51 and Nar. IV. 23 and

explains them differently. According to it the word'putra' 
( in Yaj II. 51 ) is qualified by all the three adjectives viz 
1 rikthagr&ha ', ' yosidgraha ' ( one who Is married) and 'ananya- 
sritadravya ' { one who has no wife nor child and one who has 
taken no ancestral wealth, either because he does not desire it 
or because none exists ). Therefore according to it among sons, 
the son that takes ancestral wealth has to pay the debts of the 
father, on failure of such a son when some of the sons are 
married and some are not, the married ones have to repay 
ancestral debts and lastly when there are no married sons the 
one that is wifeless, childless and' also without wealth has to 
pay them. 

Niksepa ( deposit ). The words mksepa, upamdh and nwsa 
are sometimes said to be synonyms (as done byAmara) 7 ", 
though several ancient works define them separately. According 
to Yaj IL 65 upamdhi is the deposit of an article enclosed in a 
box or the like made with another without telling him of the 
contents of the box. Yaj H. 67 holds nyasa and niksepa to be 
different from upanidhi. Naxada 7 " as quoted in the Mit on 
Yaj. II. 65 defines upanidhi as the deposit of an article in i a 
sealed receptacle without counting it in the presence of the 
person to whom it is entrusted and without telling him what 
the receptacle contains, while a niksepa is a deposit entrust 
to a man after counting the articles in his presence. Manu 
VEtt 149 (-Vsb.16.18), Kaut. W. 12 hold mksepa and upa- 
nidhi to be distinct. A verse quoted by Ksn-asvanun on l Amara 
defines nyasa as an open deposit and niksepa as the delwery 
of some goods to an artist or craftsman for bemg- worked «y £ 
Inufactared. Nar. (V. 1 and 5) defines "J* "* 
deposit of one's articles with another through «**££$. 
upanidhi is defined in the same way as Yaj ^ 65. W* 
defines nyasa as an open deposit for safe custody and mS^P 
as delivery of one's article to another for handing over to

third. K&t (592) makes 769 upamdh a generic term for all bail- 
ments such as a Bold article remaining in the hands of the 
vendor, a deposit, a pledge, bailment to one for delivery to 
another; loan of article for temporary use, goods handed over 
for sale to an agent. The Mit. on Yaj, IL 67 defines nyasa as 
handing over to some member in the house an article in the 
absence of the head of the house for delivery to the head of the 
house and niksepa as a deposit in the presence of the depositee 
himself. The V. P. p 280 briefly distinguishes the three as 
noted below. 770 

Niksepa or upantdhi -was a bailment made in trust and 
differed from an adh in this that the former was not given by 
way of security for a debt or for collecting interest but in 
confidence for safe custody. 771 Br. { SBE vol. 33 p. 332 verse 2 ) 
says that such a deposit is made with another when one is 
leaving one's home, or through fear of the king or for depriving 
one's kinsmen. 7 " Manu VHI 179 (=NSr. V. 2) says that one 
should entrust a deposit to a person who is born of a good 
family, is well-conducted, knows dharma, speaks the truth, has 
a large family, is wealthy and straightforward. The person 
with whom a deposit iB made generally receives no personal 
benefit from it ; hence the smrtis ( such as Br. in SBE 33 p. 333 
verses 6-8 ) extol the holder 773 of a deposit made in trust to be 
as meritorious as one who makes gifts of gold or other inferior

deposit or the losing of it through negligence as very Binf ul The 
idea is that no one -is hound to accept "a deposit, bat when a 
person -accepts it, his primary duty is to preserve it with care 
and the next duty is to return it at the time agreed or on 
"demand. The obligation, arises from the trust reposed in a 
person. The rights of the bailee are limited as compared, to 
those of the mortgagee or pledgee, but the very fact of his 
custody in trust" clothes him with certain rights The amount of 
care required of the depositee is the same as in the case of an 
adlu, viz he is to take the same care of it as he takes of his own 
goods and is not liable if the deposit is lost { along with Mb own 
property ) through act of God or the king or is stolen by thieves 
( Manu VIE. 189, Taj. II. 66, Nar. V. 9 and 12, Br. in S.B.E 33 
p. 333, verse 10, Kat. 593 )." 4 In the Mrcchakatika Csradatta 
accepts liability for the loss of the ornaments deposited with 
him by Vasantasena, though they were stolen, because of his 
high sense of chivalry and of his'idea that proper care was not 
taken by him or his friend. But Nar V 9 is careful to add 
that the loss through vis maiar or through theft must be real and 
not fraudulently brought about « s Nar. V. 6 and Br (in 
SBE 33 p. 334 verse 14 ) state that a deposit may be made in the 
presence of witnesses or without them, that it should be returned 
in the same way and condition in which it was made and that 
if there is a dispute, it may be settled by ordeal (when there 
are no witnesses)" 6 The article deposited must be retonea 
in the same condition (as regards seal *>• > »" ' lu S rt *"

from recognising the title of any one except the depositor, a6 
in Bection 116 of the Indian Evidence Act. But if the bailor 
be dead the bailee can return it of his own accord without 
demand to the co-owners ( Manu VIIL 186 = Nar. V. 10 ). In 
doing so however he must not return it to one of several heirs, 
but to all or in the presence of all. The loss of a deposit may 
be due to the fact that the bailee consumes it by using it, or to 
the bailee's negligence or to his ignorance. In these cases the 
bailee was made to reimburse the bailor for the loss. But Eat. 
( 597 ) W8 makes a difference, viz. when a bailee consumes the 
deposit by use he should be made to pay the price with interest, 
when he loses it through negligence he iB to pay only the price 
{but without interest) and if he loses through ignorance, then 
he is to pay a little less ( i e. less by one-fourth ) than the price. 
Vide Br. ( S B E vol. 33 p. 333 verse 11 ) and Nar. V. 8. If a 
bailor knowing the proposed bailee to be a careless man deposits 
his goods with him, the bailee is not liable even if the goods 
are lost from any cause whatever ( Kat. 599 J. 7 " H immediately 
on demand by the depositor the bailee does not return the thing 
deposited or it is lost after demand from any cause whatever 
(including act of God or king), the bailee has to return the 
thing or the price of the thing (when lost) and also is liable 
to be fined by the king in the same amount { Yaj. H. 66 Nar 
.V.7). If the bailee makes use of the article bailed without 
the permission of the bailor, he should be fined by the king and 
should be made to return the thing batted with interest (Taj. 
tt 67 Nar V. 8). In the Baj..T. ( TEL 124^157 ) occurs the 
story of a person who had deposited one lakh of dinaras witb a

fictitious items of withdrawals for many years with interest 
and showing that very little of the deposit was loft The king 
brought home the fraud to the merchant and ordered that 
the original deposit being used by the merchant should bear 
interest. 

Kat. (506) provides that when a deposit, a balance of 
interest, purchase price ( not paid though the article be delivered 
to vendee ), or sale price ( article sold being retained by vendor 
though price is paid) is not returned or paid when demand is made, 
it carries interest at 5 per cent (from the date of demand).'* 1 
Manu VIE. 191 (which is almost the same as Nar. V. 13) provides 
that where a bailee doeB not return the deposit though demand- 
ed or where a person without making a deposit claims it from a 
person, both are to be punished as a thief by the king and to 
be made to pay a fine equal in amount to the price of the bailed 
article (claimed). The deposit has to be taken back at the 
proper time by the depositor and the bailee has to avoid returning 
it at an improper time; if the latter returns at an improper 
time he should be made to pay a fine double of the value of the 
thing 781 (Eat. 601). 

Yaj. H. 67, Bite V. 14, Br.» ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 334 verse 
15) extend these rules about mksepa to other kinds of bail- 
ments viz. to yacUaka ( an article such as an ™ent toowed 
from a man on a festive occasion), armhda (what is handed 
oT to a third man and is the property of another and 

t ...Qur rr O. 182, «r. *• «*'■ 



HI ] Bides about loss cf yacitaka 459 

( pp. 436-437 ). Kaut. 783 JDL 12 states that a yacitaka or avaWta 
( lent on hire ) article should be returned in the same condition 
in which it was received. If lost through act of God or king or 
through theft ( after taking proper care ) the depositee would 
not he liable. Est. ( 610 ) provides 784 that he who having taken 
the loan of an article for use does not deliver it even on demand 
should be restrained (by the owner) and forcibly made to 
return it and fined by the king if he does not return it ; he 
should be made to pay the price with interest ( if the thing be 
lost after demand ). If the loan of an article was taken for a 
specified period or for a particular occasion or purpose and a 
demand for return be made in the middle and the article is 
not returned when demanded, the person taking the loan 
would not be made to pay the price : but if a person who has 
taken on loan an article does not return it after the period 
fixed has expired or the purpose is served, the borrower must 
offer to the owner the price if the article be destroyed or 
lost and if he does not return even after demand (when 
the period has ended ) the borrower would have to pay the price 
with interest. 

Kat (609) Btates a reasonable counter-exception to the 
rule in 606 viz. 'when the owner of an article borrowed by 
another is likely to sustain loss if the article borrowed were not 
returned on demand, then the borrower should be made to 
deliver it even though the time fixed has not ended or the pur- 
pose of the loan was only half fulfilled '.

agreed ) for finishing the work he should he made to pay ( its

artisan shall not be liable to pay the price if the article were 
to be lost through defects in the article itself ; if ( however ) 
what is delivered for being worked or polished is destroyed 
through the fault of the artisan he should be made to pay the 
price 785 . 

From the fact that Kat. 596 (quoted above in n. 778) employs 
the expression ' dapyah sa eoa tat' (he alone who misappro- 
priates or causes loss of a deposit by negligence ), the words of 
Oaut. XII 39 ( quoted above under adfo ) and the fact that 
niksepa is a title distinct from rnaduna (under which alone 
the liability of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons is expressly 
declared ) it follows that sons are not liable for the misappro- 
priation or loss of a deposit or article bailed to their father 
or other ancestor provided they have not themselves joined 
or helped in the embezzlement or loss This is made clear 
by Haradatta on Gaut. X3L 39, the Vivadacintamani and the 
Vivadacandra quoted below 786 . 

It is interesting to note that Har.'« V. 15 places on the 
same level (as to liability for loss ) with the depositee and the 
like the man who takes in his charge a minor that has a good 
deal of wealth i.e the person undertaking the position of the 
guardian of a minor's property has to take as much care of it

7SS. The British India Courts have been very much exercised over 
the question o£ the liability of ancestral property in the hands of the son for 
the obligations incurred by the father by his misconduct or embezzlement 
either as agent or manager for another or as guardian of a minor's property. 
It would follow from the passages quoted in n. 786 that ancestral property 
in the hands of the sons is not liable, ace. to some of our digests, if the father 
used or lost a deposit or loaned article by his negligence or mismanaged a 
minor's property It is firmly established that the son is not liable for a debt 
Incurred by the father in circumstances which would render the father liable 
to a criminal prosecution. Vide Toshanpal Singh v District Judge of 
Agra 61 1. A 350. In the latest case on the point, Gavtndprasad v. 
Raghunathprasad 41 Bora L. R. 589 IF. B ) the exemption is carried 
further and it is recognized that as to the exemption of the son for * avyav- 
ahartka ' debts of the father, there are many cases which cannot be recon- 
ciled, that it is repugnant to good sense to construe ancient texts ra the 
light of a system of criminal Jurisprudence developed long after, and that 
the correct rule is to hold that ' the son can claim immunity when he proves 
that the debt of the father was of a character which was illegal, dishonest or 
immoral (p G02) ■ though difficult cases may arise in the application of this 
rule It would be far beyond the scope of this work to cite or discuss the 
other numerous decisions. 



CHAPTER XVn 
ASVAMTOKRAYA ( sale by one not the owner ). 

The different modes of the sources of ownership have 
already been referred to ( H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 130 ff ) and will 
be referred to again under dayabhaga. According to Nar. VH, 1 
and Be. ( SBE vol. 33 p. 335 verse 2 ) when 789 a person, who 
holds an open deposit, a sealed deposit, an article bailed for 
delivery to another, stolen property, an article borrowed for 
some festival, a pledge, or property lost by a stranger and 
found (by him ), sells it in secret ( or behind the back of the 
owner ) it is to be considered as a sale by one who is not the 
rightful owner. Vyfisa has a similar verse. The word ' sells ' 
is only illustrative and includes gifts and pledges. Similarly 
as most sales by one not the owner are clandestinely brought 
about, Br. employs the words ' in secret ' but even if the sale is 
effected openly the same consequences may follow. The same 
rules will apply to an article lost by the owner and found by a 
stranger. Kat. ( 612 ) provides 790 that a sale, gift, or pledge, 
made by one who is not the owner, should be rescinded ( by the 
king or judge), Mann VHI. 199 and Nar. (q. by Sm. 0. II. 
p. 213, V. P p. 291 ) and others say the same thing. Yaj. IX 168, 
Nar. YII 2 provide that the owner is entitled to recover hw 
property from the person that purchases from one who is not 
the owner. If the buyer purchases an article not in the open 
market, then he is liable for punishment ; if he purchases from 
one who could have no means of possessing the thing sold 
(such as a slave without the master's consent) or _foi ; a very 
inadequate price or at a very unusual hour (at midnight or

the like ) or from bad characters then he is to be punished as a 
thWi.B.168, Vfenu J>K S. V. 166. Nlr VH. 3, Manu 
Vffl 202 Br. in SBE vol. 33 p. 336 verse 11). Such a sale is a 
fraudulent one H the buyer purchases (through ignorance) 
in market overt from one who is not the owner, he incurs no 
blame ( no punishment), but he may have to hand over the article 
to the real owner ( Visnu Dh. S. V 164-166 ). ™ ' The purchaser 
*rom one not the real owner can free himself by producing the 
vendor (called mWa in Manu VEL 202, Br. andKat.)and 
should not attempt to conceal from whom he came by the 
thing, otherwise he would be liable to be punished equally 
with the vendor as a thief ( N&r. VII. 4 ). Br. ( SBE 33 p. 335 
verse 3), Manu Vm. 201 and YSj. H 170 say that when the 
vendor has been produced by the vendee, then the latter is not 
to be proceeded against, but the vendor has to litigate with the 
real owner who has lost his property and when the vendor 
loses the suit he has to pay the price to the buyer and a fine to 
the king and &e owner gets his property back. 792 If the 
vendor has gone abroad adequate time should be granted to 
the purchaser to produce him ( KSt 615 ). The purchaser in 
order to escape blame ( punishment) has to produce the vendor 
and if that cannot be done owing to the vendor's absence he 
has to prove that he purchased 753 openly (Br. in SBE 33 
p. 335 v. 4, Manu VIE. 202, Eat. 615, 618-619 ). If he cannot 
do any of these two, then the purchaser would be liable to pay 
the price to the real owner as claimed and a fine to the king. 
Manu VHI. 198 prescribes that one who sells without being the 
owner but being a member of the owner's family should be fined

vendor selling another's arfciole through ignorance or mistake 
and one doing so with full knowledge. The person who has lost 
a chattel and claims it from the finder is described as liSsttka™ 
in Kaut JJL 16, Manu VIH, 202, Kat. ( 614 ) and elsewhere, the 
word being derived from nasta ( what is lost ). The idea is that 
,ppenly purchasing an article in the presence of a number of 
people for an adequate price negatives fraudulent intent and leads 
to the inference of a-purohase in good faith and such a purchaser 
even though he may have to part with the chattel to the real 
owner when the latter proves his title, incurs no blame and is 
entitled to recover from the vendor, if he has to surrender the 
article, the price paid by him. When a person claims a lost 
article as his he has first to prove his title and possession by 
evidence -( such as that of his kinsmen or a dooument &o. ) and 
that he had .not sold or, donated or abandoned it ; TO after he has 
proved his title the purchaser is called upon to prove his 
purchase as honest by evidence i. e. by producing the vendor or 
by showing that he purchased openly and for adequate price 
( Kat 613, Yaj. IL 170 ). When this is done the purchaser escapes 
blame but has to surrender the article to the true owher. Kat. 
(616) adds 756 that in the case of ' asvami-vikraya ' no other 
means of proof whether divine or human (except the evidence of 
witnesses such as kinsmen ) is declared to be proper. Ace to 
the V. P p 293 other evidence and even ordeals may be admissi- 
ble in sale without ownership, but the Sm. C. p. 216 and the 
Madanaratna say that on account of the express' words of Kat. 
this is not possible. If the owner who alleges the loss of an article 
fails to prove his title and prior possession he has to pay a toe 
to the king equal to Jth of the price of the article. Kat ( 6Z0 J 
and Kaut. ( ffl. 16 ) state that on failure to prove his title the 
person claiming 7 " the article as his should be fined »•***

hands of a stranger he should get him apprehended by the royal 
officers ( such as chauroddhamyitka, ace. to Mit. ), but that if the 
owner thinks that much time will be lost or distance will have 
to be traversed ( for going to officers ) he should himself Beize 
the person and bring him before the court The Mit explains 
that the buyer should have the seller arrested and, if the seller 
is dead or gone abroad, that he should hand over the article to 
the real owner. Where a purchase has been made in the mid6t. 
of a row of traders to the knowledge of the king's officers, but 
from a vendor whose habitation was unknown or where (after 
the purchase ) the, vendor dies, the real owner ( of the thing 
sold by one not the owner ) will recover his own property after 
paying half the price to the purchaser, since the rule of justice 
in such a case so requires, because to purchase from one { whoso 
habitation is ) not known is a fault ( in the purchaser ) and not 
taking proper care ( of one's goods ) is also a fault in the real 
owner (Br. in S B. E. vol 33 pp. 335-36 verses 7-9 or Eat

that a man should carry on a joint business with other persons 
of good family, that are clever, active, intelligent (or educated), 
familiar with coins, skilled in (controlling) expenditure and 
income, honest and valiant ( or enterprising ) and that joint 
undertakings like trade should not be carried on by prudent 
men with persons (partners) who are weak or lazy or afflicted 
with disease or are unlucky or destitute (of money J. 88 The 
meaning is not that all the above qualities must exist in all

some of these qualities will be absolutely necessary Nsr.

in sales or purchases of various commodities. 805 Br. (SBE

one partner may give ( or transfer ), being authorised to do so 
by the rest, or whatever document (or transaction) he may 
cause to be executed, all that is to be deemed as done by all 
partners ; the partners themselves are declared to be the judges 
(the deciding persons) or witnesses among themselves in a 
doubtful case and in case of fraud, provided they are not 
already at feud among themselves. It follows from this that 
by entering into an agreement of partneiship, each partner 
agrees that he submits to the decision of the other partners in 
cases of doubt If any one from them is found out to have 
practised fraud on the others in sales or purchases he should 
cleaT himself by special oaths or ordeals. Y§j II. 260, Nar.

partner is responsible to make good what has been lost through 
his negligence or in consequence of his acting against the 
instructions of the others or of his acting without their authority 
or consent. If any one of the partners saves partnership 
property from act of God or the king or thieves ( or similar 
calamity ) by his own exertions" he is to he awarded { as his 
special share ) one tenth of the property saved ( Yai H. 260

of these the other partners may take it and in default of them the 
king may take it after waiting for ten years to see whether any 
heir or claimant turns up. Katyayana ** states that in the case 
of artisans who together carry out some work, those among them 
who are directors of new methods get four shares, those who 
are adepts in the craft three shares, those who have studied the 
craft two shares and the apprentices only one share Whatever 
is given to Btrangers by all together ( i. e. by the partnership 
firm ) should be claimed back by the firm as such ; any single 
partner should not claim it; if he does so he will lose his share 
of the profit 810 . Some rules are prescribed by Br that among 
dancers, singers and musicians, the singers get equal shares, 
while those who beat the tune only get half share each; 
similarly in the joint construction of a mansion or a temple 
the head of the artisans gets two shares. An artisan «" {ixlpat) 
is oneiwho manufactures or works upon gold, silver, yarn, wood,

HI] linten nhont didnbiatmi of sncrificud fees 469 

It is interesting to note that the ancient Dharmasiitras of 
Gautama, Apastamba and Baudhayana are silent about partner- 
ships, that Manu ( VUL 206-210 ) lays down rules about the 
distribution of fees among the priests at a sacrifice and that in 
one verse ( VUL 211 ) he remarks that the same principles are 
to be applied in all matters where men work conjointly ( i. e. 
each is to be paid according to the importance and volume of the 
work he does). The rules about sacrificial priests in Manu 
are: If a priest chosen to do work in a sacrifice abandons his 
work a Bhare only of the fee in proportion to the work (done) 
shall be given to him by those conjointly working with him ; if 
a priest leaves after the fees are distributed ( as at the time 
of midday extraction of Soma in the great sacrifices like 
Jyotistoma ) then he keeps the whole of it and shall cause the 
remaining work to be performed by another ( who will be paid 
by the sacrificer, ace. to Medhatithi ) When specific fees are 
prescribed to be paid to individual priests at the performance 
of the several parts in a complicated sacrifice, the individual 
priests are to receive them and all are not to participate; as 
for example, the adhvaryu takes the chariot, the brahma priest 
' takes the horse in Agnyadhana, the hotr also takes the horse 
and the udgStr the cart used in purchasing the soma plant. 
The four chief priests are entitled to one half of the fees, the 
first group of their assistants will get half of what the chief 
ones get, the 2nd group $ and the fourth i. Nar. VL 10 and 
Br ( in V. R. p. 120 ) state that sacrificial priests are of three 
kinds viz. one hereditary and honoured by the ancestors of the 
sacrificer, one appointed by the sacrificer himself and one who 
performs the functions of his own accord through friendship 
and that { VL 9 and 11 ) if an officiating priest forsakes a 
sacrificer who is free from any fault and who has caused no 
harm or if a sacrificer abandons a prieBt who is faultless, they 
both shall be punished but this does not apply to the third kind 
of priest. Sankha-Likhita, as quoted in V. R. pp. 117 and 
120-131 and Sm. O. IL p. 188, give elaborate rules about sacri- 
ficial priests dying or leaving work and the fines to be imposed 
on them. Kaut. BX 14 lays down rules for the receipt of fees by 
priests when they leave off at different stages of such solemn 
sacrifices as the Agnistoma and also when the sacrificer dies 
without completing the sacrifice. The Vy. Nir. (pp. 284-285 ) 
quotes a few sentences from Kaut. BX 14. 

The above shows that in the times of the ancient sutras, 
secular partnerships had not attained sufficient importance and 



CHAPTER XIX 
DATTATS APAKAKMA ( resumption ot gift). 

ThiB title is also called dattapradaruka sa (lit that which 
is concerned with the non-delivery 01 resumption of a gift ). 
Nar. YJL 1 defines it as that title where a man desires to resume 
what has been given by him because it has been improperly ( in a 
manner opposed to law ) given by him Nar. (VII. 2 ) divides this 
title into four topics viz what may not be given, what may be 
given, what are valid giftB and what are invalid gifts. Nar. VII. 
3-5 and Br (SBE vol. 33 p. 342 verse 2) state that there are eight 
things that cannot be given ( adeya ) viz an ancakda, a deposit, 
yaataka, a pledge, property jointly owned with others, a deposit, 
son and wife, the entire property in the case of one who has 
offspring, and _ what has been already promised to another. 
VideKaut.mi6,Yaj;31175S I 6 for a similar but more com- 
pendious statement, and Kat. 638. These cannot "be given 
either because they are not one's absolute property or because 
the gift of them is forbidden by the sages. In the, case of even 
those who hold that one has ownership over one's, son or wife', 
the gift of them' is not possible because "it is forbidden, just as 
though one owns rice, yams and mgsa beans, one cannot' make 
offerings of masa because the veda prohibits, their use in the 
words ayajniya vai ralisah'U by Sahara on Jai. VX 3 %ti) 
So son. and „wife cannot be given on account of the prohibition 
in the smrtis. , The general rule o f what may he given is stated

Manu ( XL 9-10 ), Nar. VII. 6 and Br. ( quoted in H. of Dh. vol

who does so would incur sin. Manu XL 7 (=Nfir. VIL 7), Vas 
VHI. 10, Yfij L 124, Visnu Dh S. 59.8 prescribe that he alone 
who has property sufficient to provide for three years' mainten- 
ance for Ihoso whom he is bound to maintain or has more 
wealth than that may drink soma l. e. may engage in a soma 
sacrifice ( which costs much ) 

Nflr. VH. 8 Btate<3 that there are seven kinds of dalla gifts, 
i o gifts or transfers that cannot be resumed because they are

things that belong to him absolutely and are not forbidden 
They arc : the price paid for goods bought, wages, what is paid 
for pleasure (derived from dancing, singing, wrestling), a gift 
through affection, a gift made in gratitude, money paid to a 
bride's kinsmen, and gifts for spiritual or charitable purposes 
Ace to Br.«« (SBE voL 33 p. 343 verse 8) there are eight 
kinds of valid gifts. Nar. VH 9-11 mentions sixteen kinds 
of invalid gifts, which have already been set out ( in H.°n».

has also been cited). Vide KM 647. The difference between

information about a person as a thief or a felon, or as one who 
breaks the rules of decent conduct, or as an adulterous person, 
or by pointing out those who are of bad character ■ or by 
spreading false reports about a person. He further provides 
that a person offering the bribe should not be fined, bnt the 
intermediary may be fined and if the person accepting the 
bribe has been appointed to an office by the king he should be 
made to return the bribe and pay a fine eleven times as much to 
the king. But Kat. adds that where a person.not holding a 
public appointment obtains some gratification for work done, 
he would not be.held guilty and would not have to Teturn what 
he received ag a reward or in gratitude. Harita holds out 821 
other-worldly evil consequences for not actually delivering

promised gift and should inflict a fine. Kat. (643 ) provides 822 
that a man who having voluntarily promised a gift to a 
brahmana does not deliver it should be made to render it as a 
debt and should be awarded the lowest amercement and further 
( verse 566 ) that if a man promises a gift for a religious 
purpose whether in good health or in disease, his son ( or other 
heir ) should be made to pay it if the promisor died without 
aotually delivering it These verses show that in two cases 
gifts though' not completed by delivery of possession were 
enforced by ancient Indian courts viz. when the gift was 
promised to a brahmana or when the gift was declared to be 
made for a religious and charitable purpose. The last verse 
contains the beginnings of the idea of a will, since the mere 
declaration of the intention of a man to give for a religious 
purpose is made enforceable after his death against his son 
or heir. 'But this germ could not evolve into a full-fledged law of 
testamentary succession on account of the practice of adoption, 
the requirement that a gift must be accompanied by present 
possession and the incidents of the joint family on account of 
which no single member could alienate family property except 
for legal necessity and which involved the doctrine that on the 
death of a member his rights ended and passed by survivorship to 
other members. Br. expressly states this. 83 But a gift though 
promised need not be paid or carried out if the promisee tarns 
out to be an irreligious man ( Gaut. V. 21 ). Nar. VH 12 and Br. 
provide that he who enjoys an invalid gift and he who makes a 
forbidden gift are both to be punished by the king. 

In H. of Dh. vol.IL p. 841 it has been stated that gift consists

offering of a dalcsvrid, to the donee, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 855. 
Some writers like Jimutavahana dispute the statement ^ that 
acceptance is necessary to constitute a gift The Dayabhaga 
states that by the mere relinquishment of a thing by the donor 
( i e. by the activity of the donor himself ) the ownership of 
the thing passes to the person intended as the donee, that the 
ownership of the other man does not arise by acceptance, that 
though ownership in the donee does arise by the mere activity 
of the donoT, yet acceptance ( svikara ) which is an activity of 
the donee makes the thing donated capable of being disposed 
off by the donee as lie likes on account of his idea ' this is mine ' 
The Dayabhaga indulges in casuistical reasoning in support of 
its view, which it is not necessary to set out here. But the 
remarks of the Dayabhaga are, not satisfactory, since it does 
not adequately explain what is to happen if the intended donee 
refuses the gift On its hypothesis ownership has passed to 
the donee without acceptance being necessary. If the donee 
refuses, or dies without accepting, who is the owner 1 Can it 
be said that the thing becomes the property of whosoever first 
takes it up and that the donor cannot prevent a third person 
taking it up? TheV. P. pp., 436-428 severely criticizes the

(Non-payment o£ wages, non-rendition o£ service, dispnte 
between master and herdsman). 

The question about the payment or non-payment of wages 
to those whose services are hired for work is dealt with under 
this title ( Nar IX. 1 ) According to Br. there 824 are three titles 
of law in which the question of hiring enters, viz. abhyupetya- 
iu&rusa, vetamsyanapakcnma and soa.rmpalamia.da, Mann and 
Xaut. do not treat of the first of these three Here vetomsya- 
napakarma will be first dealt with, then dbliyupetyaiuinisa and 
smmipalawvada will be separately treated of. All these three 
topics are concerned with masters and servants or employers 
and employees The rules are different according as the 
contract of service is for a fixed term or for an indefinite period 
or is for executing a definite piece of work and according as 
the rate of wages or the hire is fixed beforehand or is not fixed. 
We have further to remember that the rules are spread over a 
largo period i. e from about 6th century B c. to about 500 A. D. 
(from Gaut. and £p. to Br. and Eat ) The rules deal with the 
liabilities of both masters and servants Nar.IX. 2 states that W>

the employer supplies food and clothing to the servant, the 
atter should get a fifth part of the crops ( if no wages are 
settled ) or a third part if the servant is given no food nor 
slothing hy the employer. When no wages are settled Vrddha- 
Manu prescribes that proper wages will he determined hy 
sxperts in carrying tB maritime trade ( and other traders ) who 
take into consideration the time, the place and the purpose Even 
when the wages were settled the employer could give less or 
more according to his pleasure in certain cases viz when a 
servant or agent acts against the restrictions of time and 
ilace prescribed by his employer and consequently the profit 
s much less, the employer may give less than what is agreed 
but if the agent hrings more profit ( than expected ) he may 
?ive more ( Yaj II. 195 ). When two or more employees under- 
take to finish a work hut cannot finish it ( owing to ill-health 
or similar ohstacle ) each of them should he given the wages 
appropriate to the portion done by each {as settled hy an 
arbitrator), but if the whole work is finished hy them the 
agreed wages must be paid to all of them together ( Yaj. IL 196 ). 
Yaj. H. 193, Nar. IX. 4 and ® Br. state that it is the duty of the 
employed or servant to take as much care of the utensils 
supplied by the employer as he would take of his' own, and 
that he should not act in that respect wantonly ( or crookedly ) 
and that if he did so his wages would become less. If a hired 
servant, after receiving his wages, does not do the work agreed 
to be done though able to do so, he should be made to repay 
to the employer the wages received and a fine equal to double 
of the wages and if he had not received wages but left the 
work without cause he should be made to pay to the employer

an amount equal to the wages ( Yaj n 193, Nar. IX. 5, Br. in ** 
SB,E ,vol. 33 p. 345 verse 15 ). Kaut (HL 14 ) presonbes a 
fine of 12 panas for a hired servant who does not do the work 
undertaken even after receiving the wages and that he should 
be compelled to do the work. NSr. IX 5 and Eat. 657 provide 
that that the king should compel him to do the work and then 
the agreed wages may be paid to him ; but if he does not do it 
he should be fined &1 The fine in such cases aco to Vrddha- 
Manu was 300 panas. Manu VHL 215 and Br. ( S. B. E. 33 
p. 345 verse 16) and Matsya 227. 9 provide that a hired servant, 
who though not ill, does not arrogantly do,the work agreed 
should be fined eight krsnalas and would not get wages at all. 
This applies where a substantial portion is left undone, but 
where only a little of the work undertaken is left undone then 
the servant is not to be fined, but he would lose all the wages 
( Manu VIIL 217 ). But if a servant falls ill, then he may do 
the work after he becomes well and would get the agreed wages 
even if a, long time may have elapsed (Manu VDL 216). 
Kaut. (HL 14) also provides that if the servant suffers from 
illness or is overwhelmed by a calamity, concession may to 
given to him or he may offer a substitute. The Ap. Dh. 8. (B. 
11 28 2-4 ) prescribes that if a husbandman who is not a slave 
but 'is hired for work) gives up the work or a cowherd acta 
similarly he should > punished with flogging and the animals 
handed over to the cowherd should be taken back from him. 
This may have been the ancient law, but.it was ™™ m ™ 
later ages. Kaut. '(HI. 13) stetes that if the employer doe 
not pay the wages he should be fined six panas or a tenth part 
of the proper' wages or the wages agreed upon and if thehu

master during the period fixed. 

Taj. IL 197, Nar IX. 9, Kat. 659, Visna Dh. 8. m V. 155-156 
provide that if through the fault of a carrier ( and not through 
act of God or the king) goods entrusted to him for carrying are 
lost or become deteriorated, lie should be made to pay for the 
loss. Vrddha-Manu specifies that if the goods are lost through 
the negligence of the servant he has to pay only the price, 
but if through spite then he should be made to pay double the 
price. If a hired servant ( such as a palanquin-bearer or an 
anned guard ) causes obstruction ( by refusing to work ) at the 
time of starting for an auspicious matter ( such as a marriage ), 
he should be made to pay double the amount of the wages 
agreed upon and another servant may be engaged ( Ysj, II. 197, 
Nar. IX. 8, Kat. 658, Yrddha-Manu in V E. p. 163). Yaj. IL 198,' 
Nar. IX 7 provide that if a servant abandons his work ( as a 
bearer or guard) after a start is made (when not seized by 
illness) he should be made to pay 3f,i or the whole of the 
wages according to the distance traversed and a master 
abandoning a servant in similar circumstances should be made 
to pay similarly. 

If a servant agrees to take a lump sum for some work to be 
done for a certain period and leaves the work before the period 
elapses he would lose all the wages, but if he leaves in the 
middle of the period through the fault of the employer ( such as 
scolding without any fault of the servant ) he would be entitled 
to receive a proportionate part of the wages (Ear. q. by V R

of 100 panas and that if the employer abandons the servant 
before the period fixed has expired he would hare to pay the 
whole of the wages to the servant and a fine of one hundred 
panas ( except in the case of act of God and the king ). Eat 
(660 ) provides that a master deserting on a journey his servant 
that is tired or falls ill should be fined the first amercement if 
he does not wait for three days in the village. If a trader after 
engaging a vehicle or draught animals for carrying his 
merchandise for hire, does not employ them to carry his goods 
he should be made to pay a fourth of the hire settled and the 
whole of it if be discharges them when only a part of the 
journey has been made ( 2Tar. IX. 7 ) If the merchandise be 
attached 836 (by the king's oflScers for toll &c) or be stolen 
the servant engaged to carry the goods will receive a propor- 
tionate amount ( out of the lump sum agreed to be paid fore 
certain journey ) according to the distance travelled ( Kat. 661) 
If the employer does not pay the wages of a servant even 
though the latter has done his work the king should make him 
pay the wages and also a proper fine (Br in S. B. B vol. S3 
p 346 veree 18 ). If a man 837 having hired elephants, horses, 
bulls, asses or camels does not return them even though the 
work ( for which he hired them ) is finished he should he made 
to restore them together with the hire (up to the day of return) 
The same rule applies to a man taking on rent a house or 
water ( reservior ) or a market and not giving it up at the ttae 
fixed (Kat. 66Z-663) ffar. (IX. 20-31) provide*. &at if a

has to give up the land. An important rule is stated by ISv. 
(S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 346 verse 17) that whon a servant 838 employ- 
ed by an employer does some improper act { such as a theft ) ito 
another for the benefit of his master, the latter would be held 
responsible for the loss. Ihe, Matsyapurana says, that if a 
teacher having agreed to teach a lore or craft for money which 
he receives fails to do so, he should be fined the whole of the 
amount 839 of the fee. 

From the above it will be clear that contracts of service 
and letting on hire are lumped together under one head by 
the smrtis. 

Kaut. IU. 14 provides that persons may be paid wages by a 
guild or corporation of workers of which they are members. 
The'earnings of such guilds may be divided equally among all 
workers or as agreed upon among themselves. Yaj. EL 265 also 
refers to the fact that rules similar to those of partnerships 
may apply to guilds of husbandmen and artisans. 

Certain rules are laid down in NSr. IX. 18, Yaj. II. 292 and 
Mateyapurana 227. 144-146 about the monetary liabilities of 
prostitutes and persons visiting them. Vide H. of Dh. vol; -EL 
pp. 638-39 above. The Matsyapurana (227. 144-146) states 
that a brahmana who visits a prostitute should be fined as 
many panas as he paid to her, that if a prostitute after receiv- 
ing her fee does not receive the visitor and goes elsewhere she 
should be made to pay to the visitor double of the fee and a 
similar sum as fine to the king, and that if one, after telling a 
prostitute that she is to visit a certain person, takes her to a 
different person, ho should be fined one gold masaka. 

The Matsyapurana (227.147) further states that a visitor 
who has had sexual intercourse with a prostitute and yet has 
not paid her fee should be made to pay double the (agreed) fee to 
her and a similar sum as fine to the king. Nsrada provides that 
the chief prostitutes and the voluptuaries that stay with them

a similar fine in the case contemplated in Matsya 827.147. 

Mki/upetitasitfiusS ( non-rendition of service after making 
a contract to serve or obey } M1 . Nar "vUL 1 defines it as the 
title in which after having undertaken to serve or obey one 
does not act up to it. The ancient dharrnasutras mention only 
two kinds of servants viz. agricultural labourers and herdsmen 
Vide Ap Dh. S.1L11.28. 2-3 andGaut. XII 16-17 m . Aco. 
to Nsr. Yfll. 2 and 3 there are five kinds of servers ( or atten- 
dants ) viz. four that are called Icarmaktra ( performers of 
labour ) and the fifth class comprehends slaves of fifteen kinds ; 
and the four karmakaras are pupil (itsya), apprentice (aiMmrl!), 
a hired servant (bhrtaka) and' one who supervises hired 
servants (adhtcarmakrl). Not being free to do as they like is 
the common attribute of these five kinds of attendants, but theie 
is a distinction among them due to their castes, their peculiar 
actions and their mode of maintaining themselves (Nar YDL 4). 
A sisya ( pupil ) is one who desires ( from his teacher ) instruc- 
tion in Vedic learning, an antevasin is one who receives instruc- 
tion in some craft such as goldsmith's work or dancing, a hued 
servant is one that does some work for wages, an adhikaimaktfc 
is one who supervises hired servants. Work is of two kinds, 
iubha (i. e. pure, done by the four kinds of karmakaras) and 
aiubha i. e impure ( done only by slaves). Asubha acts com- 
prise 813 (Nar. VUL 6-7 and Kat.720) sweeping the doors ot 
houses, pits in which leavings of food are thrown, roads, rubbish 
heaps; scratching or shampooing the private parts (of tw 
masters); collecting and throwing away leavings ot ma, 
ordure and urine and making use of one's limbs (hand &c ) at 
the master's desire for wiping off the master's private parts, «»

Hired servants have different grades among them arising 
from the work they do, the wages they receive and the period 
for which they are employed and they are distinguished from 
apprentices in these respects and not as regards caste or mode of 
maintenance. According to Mr. Tin. 22-23' and' Br. ( S. B. B 
vol. 33, p 344 verse 8 ) a hired servant is of three kinds and his. 
wages depend on the work he doss and his ability to do it. ' The 
three kinds are the highest (viz a soldier), middling (an 
agriculturist ), ttw lowest 846 (a porter) A. hired servant may

A person who is employed and given authority overall 
servants and also one who look B to the affaire ( expenditure &c ) 
of *he household is called ' adhikarmakita ( or-krt ), aeo. to Nar 
VUL 24. All these four are called workers m clean occupa-' 
turns, while the fifteen kinds of slaves are employed in tho 
lowest and dirtiest work {Nar. VIII. 25) The difference 
between the hired servants and slaves is this that the latter 
surrender all their freedom and themselves entirely to another, 
while the former, though dependent to some extent, do retain 
some freedom (Kat ,715), but a brahmana was not to be a 
slave 818 . In very ancient times the master's liability for the 
acts of his servant does not seem to have been recognized. For 
oxample, Gaut XII 11 states that if cattle entrusted to a 
herdsman cause loss to crops, then the herdsman is to be held 
responsible ( and not the owner who employs the herdsman ). 
But Manu, VUL .243, Yaj. JL 161, Nar XIV. 29 appear to 
hold the master liable to make good the loss caused by the 
herdsman's default Vide Br. quoted above under lettmtwju- 
rutpSkarma. 

The kinds of slaves and the incidents of slavery have Icon 
already dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. E pp 180-189. A few 
matters not refened to there may ,be dealt with here ' Buddhist 
India' p. 55 (by Rhys Davids) shows how slavery in the 
Buddhist period was not as miserable as under the Greeks The 
RajataranginI IV 39 state* that king Vajraditya of Kashmir 
( in the 8th Century A D. ) sold many men as slavos to 
Mlecchas. One cannot help blaming the British Indian Govern- 
ment for the Assam Labour and Emigration Act ( VI of 1901 ) 
whereby a modified form of serfdom or slavery was legalised for 
the benefit of the tea planters of Assam, Bengal and other 
provinces and by sections 168-169 of which poor indentured 
labourers who were induced to labour on the sumptuous monthly 
wages of five rupees were liable to be sentenced to to « in

agreement they were tied down in unhealthy districts and 
unhealthier surroundings. 

Kat. (725 } provides that 819 if a woman who is not a slave 

marries a slave she becomes a slave since her husband is her 

lord and is dependent on his master. If a person buys or sells 

abrahmanawoman^asa slave the king should annul that 

transaction and all persons ( concerned in it ) should be fined 

by him and the same holds good in the case of a woman of a 

respectable family who took shelter with a person and was 

made a slave by him or transferred by him to another as a 

slave ( Eat. 726-727 ). The punishment of first amercement is 

prescribed for a person who has sexual intercourse with the 

nurse of his child or with another woman who is not a slave 

and the wife of his attendant as if she were a slave ; and a flue 

of two hundred panas is provided in case a master who is not in 

difficulties and is well-off desires to sell a female slave who is 

faithful and weeps bitterly (being unwilling to leave him). 

Har. VliL 40 provides that if a slave leaves his master and goes 

over to another saying * I am your slave ' that would not help 

the slave, as his former owner would be entitled to claim him 

back. Uaauas states ssl that a guru ( elderly person ), a sapatda, 

abrahmana and persons of the lowest castes ( candalas &c. ) 

cannot be made slaves, nor can any one ( of the higher castes ) 

who is superior in learning be the slave of one of the same 

caste.

SAMYID-VYATIKRAMA AND OTHER TITLKS 
( Violation of compacts or conventions) 

N§r. (XIH. 1 ) employs the expression •nmayasyuaaiiSlimmn. 
Manu VUL 5 employs the first expression. Manu (VIU. 218-219) 
has both names in view, when he says ' I shall now declare the 
rules applicable to those who violate samayas ( conventions ) 
He who having entered into a compact (sniuad) under (the 
sanction of) an oath with the inhabitants of a village or a 
district or with a group of traders or other persons break* 
it through greed should be banished from tho kingdom bj 
the king.' In Ap. Dh. S. J. 1. 1. 2 and II 4, 8 13 the word 
' samaya ' B2 Is employed in the sense of 'convention or accept- 
ed doctrine '. The same word is also used in tho sense of 
' agreement * as in Yaj. I 61 { g&ndharvdh mnayanmUhah ) In 
this title it means ' the acceptance of a certain rule or convent- 
ion arrived at by many \ as explained by ^ ModhStithi on 
Manu Vm. 219. It signifies a local or caste usage or convent- 
ion made by groups of people ( such as guilds and corporations ) 
binding on all members that form or join tho bovcrnl group*.

be of one mind, that any one of those who encouraged this 
decision would be liable to be punished if he backed out of it 
through some inducement offered by the headman of the other 
village. NaT. XlTl. 1 explains that samayu means the rules ( or 
conventions) settled among heretics, itaifjamas ssi and the like. 
Yaj IL 192 and Nar. TCrn. 2 provide that the conventions of 
guilds, tmgamas, heretics, srenis, pugas, ganas and in towns 
and districts should be enforced by the king and their traditional 
mode of conducting their business should be protected Some 
remarks have already been made on guilds and corporations 
above (pp. 156-57 notes 196-198). Vide also H. of Dh. vol. 
H pp. 66-69 for the guilds and corporations and the meanings 
of words like irem, jmga, gayu etc. Some further informa- 
tion is added here. The Sm. O. ( IL p. 223 ) has a very "^ interes- 
ting note illustrating the various conventions of several groups 
and its remarks are copied verbatim by the V. P. pp. 332-333. 
It says : ' Even heretics have certain rules made for the benefit 
of their monasteries Among naigamas there is a practice that 
those who disregard messages brought by servants wearing a 
specific jacket ( as a uniform ) should be fined. Srenis are 
guilds of craftsmen such as weavers. They have rules that 
certain articles are to be sold only by a certain guild and by no 
other. Pfigas aTe groups of elephant riders and horse riders.' 
Vrata is defined by Kat, as a body of persons armed with various 
weapons, while the Mahabhasya on Panini V. 2. 21 ( watena 
jivatt) explains it as a 'group of men of several castes and several 
occupations who make a living by relying on their formidable 
bodies '. Ace to the Mit. heretics are those like the Bauddhas

to Mifc ' an assemblage of armed persons subsisting by follow- 
ing one occupation ', while Kat ( 680 } says it ib a corporation 
of brahmanas. In the Bajat II. 132 reference is made to corpora- 
tions of pwrohitas at temples and tirthas ( sacred places ). Hie 
Sm. states that among pugas and vratas there is a convention 
that they must go to battle all together and not separately. 
Among ganas there is a visage that the lobes of the ear (of a child) 
are to be pierced on the 5th day or in the fifth year from birth. 
Among viahajanas in a settlement of brahmanas there is a 
convention that a brahmana repairing to them for collecting 
fees to be paid to his teacher ( at the close of Vedic study) should 
bo honoured ( i e. should be paid some contribution ). In 
certain districts there is a usage that either the seller or the 
buyer should keep in his hand x Ss of the price (probably for 
finding out whether the article is useful for the purpose in hand 
and resiling from the bargain if it is not ). In forts or capitate 
there is a rule that corn taken out of it by a person with him 
when going out elsewhere Bhould not be sold by him. In villages 
there is a rule that in pastures no digging would he allowed. In 
the hamlets inhabited by abhiras there is a convention that for 
adultery by a male or female there is to be no fine. It does 
credit to the ancient writers on dharmasastra that they were 
tolerant enough to require the king, whatever his own religious 
persuasion might be, to honour and enforce the usages of even 

heretics among themselves. The o^^'T^ttost

Whoever goes against the heads of tbe group that are working

by them for their group and whatever tiiey obtain through the 
king's favour should be shared egually by all ( members of the

professedly incurred by the committee for the group but was 
misappropriated by them or applied to their individual purposes 
must be paid by them and that those who subsequently join the 
groups already formed become egually entitled to the property 
and liable for the debts previously acquired or incurred. Mami

rules about repentance and reooveTy within ten days to all

of ten days for repentance is allowed to vendors and vendees 
only in the case of land, and that the period is 12 clays when 
the parties to sale of land are sapindas of one another and 
that in other cases the period is even shorter. m Yaj. II. 257. 
Nar. XI. 7-8, Br. ( S. B. "S. vol. 33 p. 350 veTse 4 ) provide that 
when a vendor having sold a thing to one man for a price

An article sells it as free from defects he should be made to 
return double the price to the purchaser and a fine equal to 
double the price to Viie king. 865 The above rules apply where 
the purchaser has paid the price, but if there is a mere agree- 
ment and no price is paid, then the vendor or vendee is guilty 
of no wrong if he resiles from the bare agreement to sell or buy 
unless they have made an express stipulation that the agree- 
ment cannot be rescinded ( NaT. 33. 10 ). When at the time of the 
agreement for sale, the vendee pays something by way of ear- 
nest, then if the sale goes off through the fault of the vendor, 
the latter has to return to the vendee double of the earnest; 866 
but if the purchaser does not finally take it he loses the thing 
and also the earnest. Nar. XEL 1 prescribes that when a vendee 
after having purchased a thing for a price repents of the pur- 
chase that is the title of law called * rescission of purchase.' 
Nar XTL 2 prescribes that if the purchaser thinks that he has 
made a bad bargain he may return the thing purchased to the 
vendor on the same day in an undamaged condition ( and may 
receive back the price paid); but if he returns it on the 2nd 
or 3rd day after the purchase (including the day of purchase ) 
he will have to lose respectively one-thirtieth or one-fifteenth of 
the price and after the third day he cannot return the thing at 
all (IS&r XH. 3 ). But Yaj. H. 177 and Nar. m 5-6 lay down

the following periods for examination of things purchased, viz 
one, three, five, seven, ten days, half a month and one month 
respectively in the case of iron (and clothes), milch cattle, 
beasts of burden, jewels (preoioiiB stones, pearls and corals), all 
sorts of grain, a male slave and a female slave It must he 
supposed that these verees contain exceptions to the general 
rule in Maim VET 222 cited above. Kaut. (HI. 15 ) allows only 
one night, three nights, five nights and seven nights for repentance 
to traders, hushandmen, cowherds, the mixed castes and higher 
castes and provides that where the articles sold are perishable a 
very short time only may be allowed. The above rules apply 
only when the purchaser made no examination at the time of 
purchase NaT.* 67 XII 4 and Br. (S. B. B vol 33 p. 350 verse 
3 ) recommend that a purchaser should himself closely examine 
an article before buying it and also show it to others in order 
to find out its defects and good qualities and provide that when 
he has approved of an article after close examination he cannot 
return it to the vendor Vyasa provides that hides, fuel, bricks, 
yarn, grain, intoxicants, fluids, gold, inferior metals (like lead 
and tin) and other wealth should be carefully examined then 
and there i. e. when once bought after close examination none 
of these can he returned even if some defect 8 « is found therein

proper prioe; a price which is less or more than it by one-eighlh

price may be annulled even after a hundred years Kat. 
(704) states that when the owner at a field absconds to- 
gether with the surety 872 for the payment of the land tax, the 
judges of the court may order a sale for recovery of the tax and 
that such a sale may be set aside up to ten years and a com- 
promise or exchange up to three generations, if it is inequitable 
Bharadvaja provides that when taxes are not paid both by tbe 
tax-payer and his surety even when called upon to do so, then 
the king may order a charge on the land or sale of the land.

(712) further 875 prescribes that the unpaid purchase money 
carrieb compound interest after demand if no time is fixed for 
payment, but, if a time is fixed, then only the balance has to 
be paid up to the end of that period Br provides that in all

was banished from the country by the king, his property

HI ] Definitions of •sale, exdiange &c 495 

The Vyavaharanimaya, after quoting Br. and Vyasa, very 
lucidly explains what is meant by sale, purchase, exchange &c. 
Gold and the like which a man desires to render or pay is called 
price, while land, house and the like are said to be ' panya ' 
f saleable thing ) Purchase means acceptance of a thing pre- 
ceded by the offering of a price { either paid or agreed to be 
paid ) ; sale is the acceptance of a price preceded by the offering 
of a saleable thing Paiwrth or panvurUma is the acceptance 
of an article f ot an article of the same kind ; if there is a 
disparity in value between the two articles exchanged the 
exchange is called ' avakraya '-, when there is an exchange of 
two articles of different kinds but of the same value it is called 
nnimaya *™ The Vyavaharanirnaya makes elaborate provi- 
sions for sale of land at the order of the king for non-payment 
of land tax It quotes PrajSpati ( p. 350 ) to the effect that the 
purchaser at such a sale must offer half or at least one-fourth 
of the real price of the field and that the original owner could 
get back his property sold for the royal dues by paying the 
full price to the purchaser up to three generations. Other 
elaborate rules on the same subject are passed over here for 
TeasonB of space These provisions indicate that ownership in 
cultivated fields belonged to individuals and that the State had 
only the right to levy taxes Vide H of Dh. vol. II pp 865-869 
and KSt quoted above ( on p. 196 ) for a discussion of the theory 
of the State's ownership of all lauds. Taking into consideration 
the Purvamlmamsa texts, the Vyavaharamayekha and the verses 
of Kat. and others it appears that the State was deemed to he 
the owner of all lands as a general proposition, but that where 
individuals oi bodies of persons had been in long possession of 
lands that they cultivated, the ownership of fhe State was 
qualified and restricted on ly to the recovery of a tax or share

of crops and that individuals and gioups that had cultivated 
lands in their possession were regarded practically as owners of 
the land subject to the liability to pay land tax and to the right 
of the State to sell the land for non-payment of tax. The 
Vyavaharanimaya quotes Br and another smrti text that sfldras, 
perborw excommunicated for grave sins ( paMn ), c&udslag and 
desperate characters cannot be allowed to possess the lands of a 
brahmana by sale, partition or in lieu of wages, 87 ' the flame work 
further guotes Vy&sa, Bhavadvaja and Br. that when land is sold 
there is a right of pre-emption in tavour of full brothers, 
bapindas, satnanodakas, sagotras, neighbours, creditors and 
one's co-villagers in order. ^ 

Gifts of immovables were looked upon in very ancient 
times with disfavour, though they were made even in the times 
of the Upanisads Vide H. of Dh vol IL pp 740-41 But sales 
of land must have been rarer still in ancient times owing to the 
patriarchal and joint family systems. The Mit on Yaj 31 114 
quotes a verse forbidding the sale of immovable property;* 81 
but sales of lands are mentioned in many copperplate grants. 
Vide Paharpur plate grant of Gupta year 159 i e 478-79 A. D. 
in E. I. vol 20 p. 59 ( where one kulyavapa of land is stated to

sary formalities of a sale, but that they are recommended for the 
sake of greater caution and convenience, that the assent of the 
villagers is to be seoured for the publication of the transaction 
of sale, as a text says that acceptance, particularly of im- 
movables, should be made openly, that the neighbours* assent 
should be secured for preventing boundary disputes, that the 
assent of agnates and cwfcarers is desired for making it easy to 
complete the transaction, that it "does not follow that without 
the assent of these the sale of land Is not valid or complete. 
Water and gold are to be offered because gifts being highly 
commended, a sale should be clothed outwardly with the same 
formalities. Vide Dr. P. N. Sen's 'Hindu Jurisprudence ' 
pp. 76-78 for the opposite procedure of the anoient Boman Law 
that gifts were to be clothed with the formalities of sale. For

Svarmpalaowada ( disputes between the • owner of cattle

lesponsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman 
and during the night on the owner provided they are in the 
latter's house. When there is no express agreement as to wages 
Nar JX.10 and Br (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verse 19) prescribe that n 
cowherd BM will get as his wages all the milk of the cows 
tended by him on every eighth day plus a heifer (two years old) 
eveiy year out of every one hundred cows tended by him or a 
milch cow with her calf every year for every two hundred com 
looked after by him Manu VHI 231 provides another method 
when no wages are fixed by agreement viz. a hired herdsman, 
who is, paid with milk, may milk as hire the best cow out of ten 
with the consent of the owner It is the duty of the cowherd 
to struggle as much as in him lies' to protect the cows from 
accidentsand if he is unable to do so he must quickly inform 
the owner (Nar., IX. 13). Br (S B. E 33 p 346 verse 20) 
states 8S * that the cowherd shall save cattle irorn the danger of 
worms (or reptiles ), robbers, tigers and from caverns and pits 
and that he should try to protect them to the best of his ability, 
should call out for help or ' inform his master. If the herdsman

to pay a fine of 1%\ panas ** to the king ( Yaj. II 165 ) Ap. Dh. 
S 11 11. 28. 6 makes 887 the herdsman liable to pay the price if 
an animal in his charge dies or is lost (by theft &c ). Manu 
VTH. 333, 236, Nar JX 16, Vyasa state exceptions to the above 
viz where an animal is carried away 8SS by robbers though the 
herdsman raised a cry, he would not be liable to make good 'the 
loss provided he gave information to his master At the proper 
time ( immediately after the animal is carried away ) and 
proper place ; or when the herdsman himself is seized or the 
village is attacked or the country is invaded, the herdsman 
would not be liable for loss or seizure of any animal under his 
charge ; and also where, while the herd is grazing in a proper 
order near a forest, a wolf suddenly kills an animal. Manu 
VHI 234, Uar. IX. 17 state that when cattle die through act of 
God or king or die without any fault of bis while in charge of a 
herdsman, he has to free himself from liability or from the 
suspicion of himself having' 885 carried away surreptitiously the 
animal by producing before his master their ears, skih, tails, 
bladders, tendons and yellow bile or by showing their limbs 
(viz. their characteristic marks). Vyasa states that if a 
herdsman, who has received his wages, abandons cattle in an 
untenanted forest and moves about in the village he should be 
fined by the king. 8 * 1

that horses and elephants are protectors of people Aparirka

horses and elephants. Usanas adds that (owners of) cows 
Bhould not be fined when they cause some loss at the time of 
festivals and sraddhas. The great veneration for cows led 
Usanas to lay down that he who requires the owner of a cow 
to re-imhurse the loss of crops that are eaten up or destroyed 
by a cow will find that his pit rs and the gods do not receive the 
offerings made 856 by him This iB explained by the Par. M. HI.

CHAPTER XXII 

SIMAVIVADA (boundary disputes). 

This is called ksetrajamoada & ' ( disputes relating to fields) 
by Narada XIV. 1, who defines it as ' dispute with regard to 
land in which questions about dikes or embankments, the 
boundaries of fields, ploughed land aud fallow land have to be 
decided ' Narada's idea appears to be that the word 'tflmavivfida' 
in Mauu is only illustrative and is a compendious way of 
mentioning disputes about land in general According to Kat 
( 732 ) there are six causes ■* of land disputes viz claiming 
more land, claim that a person is entitled to less than he 
possesses, claim to a share, denial of a share, seizing possession 
when previously there was none, boundary In all these cases 
boundaries have directly or indirectly to be settled and there- 
fore all these are included under the topic of nimSmvada A 
boundary dispute may relate to the boundaries of a district 
( janapada ), a village, a field and a house. Boundaries, ace. to 
Nar., may be of five kinds. 8 " They are described as follows: 
dvhajinl is what is indicated by trees which are like a flag- 
staff. Manu (VUL 246-247) prescribes that trees suoh as 
asvattha, the silk cotton, sala, tela ( palmyra palm ), that have 
milky juice (like udumbara) should be planted to indicate 
boundaries and also bamboo clumps, bushes, reeds to a 
malsymi (lit. having fish) boundary is provided by nvers ftwmg 
naturally and full ot fish and tortoises or by _ tw*» *" 
reservoirs of water ( Manu VIH 248 ) A ^f^^T^

and are buried inside the earth Mann ( VIII. 250-251 ) eimvue- 
rates those objects that should be buried in the earth, which 
would serve to indicate the boundaries of a village or field and 
which are therefore called concealed (tiparehannii) by him. A 
bltayatAjojitii (free from danger) boundary is settled by the 
agreement of the parties) The fifth kind is the one that is laid 
down by order of the king. Bt (S. B. E 33 p 351 verse B) 
prescribes* 10 that at the time of founding a village definite 
boundaries should be erected or constructed by means of visible 
or patent {ptalasu) and concealed (upamsu or upacchanna) 
signs and the 3m G 11. 338 explains that a row of big stones 
should be employed to indicate the boundary. Brhaspati (S. B. 
E. vol 33 p 351 verses 3-7 ) states what patent and concealed 
boundary marks should be and requires elderly persons to 
point them out to youths and children who in their turn when 
old axe to point out the boundaries to other youths and in this 
way traditional knowledge of boundaries may be kept up. Mann 
(Vlll 352-353) states that in disputes boundaries should be 
bettled in accordance with the visible and concealed signs des- 
cribed above, by reliance on long former enjoyment and by the 
constant flow of water and that if there be doubt even after 
observing the signs then the dispute has to be decided on the evi- 
dence of witnesses. Witnesses could either depose to the marks 
of boundaries or to the boundaries themselves. Those who 
could not point out the marks but were to define the boundaries 
themselves were to follow a certain procedure Manu VUL 254 
states that the witnesses should be asked about the marks 
of boundaries in the presence of the litigating parties and 
groups (or families) of the villagers The witnesses on being 
asked were to trace, point out and settle the boundary unani- 
mously, being clad in red garments, wearing red chaplets and 
being exhorted to depose truly by their spiritual merit 901 and 
carrying clods of earth on their heads, by reference to mounds 
or depressions, coals, bones and chaff (buried underground,

Vas 16 13, Kauf HI 9, Yaj IL 150, Manu \T1L 258, 260, 
Jsar ( XIV 2-3 ) prescribe that on failure of witnesses of tlia 
adjoining villages, neighbours (samanta),* 01 old men, cowherds 
husbandmen who plough the fields near the one in dispute, 
hunteis, fowlers, fishermen, snake catchers and foresters should 
settle the disputed boundary in the presence of the king The 
Mit. on Yaj *» H 153 quotes Kat (743-745, 51) to show that 
witnesses were divided into sUmania, mauln, hrrirllia and mMhjia, 
each preceding group being superior to the succeeding The 
Mit. further says that the neighbours as witnesses are to hs 
arranged in the form of the layers of the petals of a lotus vit 
the nearest ones ( tamialtaka ) are those most preferred, (but if 
this group has faults ) then a second but a more removed group 
and then a third group still more remote may be examined 
Sankha-Likhita and Vas. 901 16.13-15 prescribe that in boundary 
disputes the decision depends on neighbours, in the case of 
conflict of witnesses on documents and then on the old men in 
the town or village and the guilds. Ysj. H 152 and Manu Jffl. 
258 require that the neighbours who are to settle the boundary 
should be four, eight or ten ( even in number > and J™"* 
of the same village (if possible). Br. (S B B 33 p 35- 
verse 14 ) requires that the witnesses 9 * should know the source 
of title ( to the disputed land ), the measurement ( m mwta* , 
.ftnft* to. ), the length of enjoyment or V™^J***Z^ m

HI ] A single witness not to settle boundary 505 

that a single witness however confident he might be ( or how- 
ever reliable) should not take upon himself to point out and 
settle the boundary, since this ( boundary ) dispute being a very 
important ( difficult ) matter, its decision should rest with many. 
The Mit. < on Yaj. H. 153 ) explains that this prohibition holds 
sood only if the single witness is one not accepted by both sides 
as reliable. But Nar. ( 30V. 10 ) and Br. { S. B. B» 33 p. 352 
veree 11 ) hold that where a single witness accepted by both 
sides has to settle the boundary (in the absence of more 
witnesses and in the absence of reliable patent or concealed 
signs ) he should do so after placing a clod of earth on his head, 
after being dressed in red robes and wearing red flowers and 
after observing a fast. If it was a sudra who was to trace or 
lay down a boundary Visvarupa w on Yaj. H. 156 quotes a prose 
passage of Brhaspati that he was to be decked in red pieces of 
cloth, his face was to be smeared with ashes from a cemetery, a 
mark was to be made on his chest with five fingers dipped in 
the blood of a goat and the entrails of the sacrificed goat were 
to be tied round his neck and he was to hold a clod of earth 
in the right hand. All this was to impress upon him the gravity 
of the work and the necessity of doing his best impartially. If 
no knowing witness or no patent or concealed signs are available 
the king has himself to settle the boundary between the two 
villages athis own discretion (Yaj. II 153, Nar. XIV. 11, Manu VUI. 
265). He may divide the land between the two villages equally 
and construct new marks of boundaries, but if the disputed land 
will be of greater benefit to one village than to the other 
the king may assign the whole of the disputed land to the 
former Manu "V3IL 245 prescribes that when there is a 
boundary dispute between two villages the king should decide 
it in the month of Jyestha when the embankment (marks) become 
quite clear ( owing to water being dried up in summer ). The 
decision made by the witnesses or neighbours became final 
only after the lapse of three weeks if no calamity ( from act

VIE, 263 Taj IL 153, Nix. XIV 7 prescribe the middle amer- 
coment for each one of the oanmrdws that falsely settle Hid 
boundaries, while Maim (VHI. 257) and Mr XIV. 8 prescribe 
the first amercement only for other witnesses such as members 
of corporations and elderly villagers. If through friendship, 
greod or fear the witnesses who know the facts do not come 
forward to settle the boundary they are each to bo fined in the 
highest amercement (Kat. 909 750). 

Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 353 ven.es 19-21) lays down certain 
interesting rules about alluvion and diluvion. Where a river 
is the boundary between two villages and the river carries away 
soil from one village and attaches it to another, the accretion 
belongs to the village to which it becomes attached, but this is 
so when the soil carried away has no crops growing on it; if 
however soil with growing crops is separated from a village and 
joined to another by a river in flood, the former owner can reap 
only the crops and the land will belong to the village or field 
to which it has become attached 9l0

ni ] Decision of boundaries of field* &c. - 50? 

ManuVIIL262,Yaj.II. 154, War. XIV. 12, Ktt ™J>*f- 
cribe that the decision of disputes about the boundaries of fields, 
wells, tanks, groves and parks, palaces, houses, cottages, temples 
and channels carrying vain water is to be similarly arrived at by 
the testimony of witnesses ( wmvUi* and others ) 

Several rules are laid down by Nar., Br. and Kat. about 
easements and water-courses 

Br.(S B. E. 33 p 354 verse 24) prescribes that no 9U inter- 
ference should be caused to the manner of the enjoyment of 
houses (as regards doors, compounds &c), to the enjoyment of 
water and markets in the way in which they had been enjoyed 
from the time the village or house was established or built. 
This means, ace. to the Sm. 0. II. p. 234 and V. P. p. 363 that if 
a new mode of enjoyment is started in the case of these after 
the village was established or the house was built then inter- 
ference may be allowed. Br. (S. B. E 33 p. 354 verse 25) 
further says that ancient windows, 912 watercouises, balconies 
(pegs?), raised platforms on the borders of- streets, waterspouts 
carrying rainwater from a square of houses (and cottages) en- 
joyed from former days should not be allowed to he interfered 
with, even if they might cause some inconvenience to the neigh- 
bouring house Eat (752-753) similarly provides 'one should 
not interfere with the base of the wall, a drain (or waterspout), 
a balcony, window, watercourse and dwelling house of another. 
These are not to he added to one's house after the first building* 
of it (so as to cause obstruction or annoyance to another), one 
should not open a window 913 (so as to command a view) in the 
interior of another's house or open a spout (that will drain off

(pits) for depositing ordure, urine and filthy water, a fireplace 
and a pit at a distance of at least two cubits from the walls 
of other people ( his neighbours ) and should not construct these 
very near to another's house ' ( vide also Br S. B. B. vol 33 
p. 354 verses £5-26). 

Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 verse 27) defines a samsai ana m as the 
road by which men and beasts pass to and fro without let "or 
hindrance Kat. (755) calls it catuspatJia and defines iaja~ 
marga as the road by which people are allowed to paBsat 
certain times ( and not at all times ). Several rules are 
prescribed by Kautilya and others for obviating nuisances 
on public roads or near private houses. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 
verse 28) and Kat (756) provide that roads should not be 
obstructed by parking 91 * carts and the like thereon, that no 
one should plant anything on a public road, that a man who puts 
obstruction on the public road, makes pits or plants trees or 
wilfully voids excrement thereon should be fined a masaJat, and 
one who does not give" 6 precedence on the road to his guru, 
preceptor or the king should be fined. Manu'IX. 282 prescribes 
the fine of two kaisapanas for voiding or dropping ordure on 
the public road in the "absence of distress and requires the 
wrongdoer to clean the road, but Manu (IX. 283) makes an 
exception in the case of persons diseased, very old men, a 
pregnant woman and a child, who are not to be fined but 
Ly reproved for voiding ordure on the road. Vide Matoya 
227 175-76 for the same two verses Kaut n. to P^ 
cribes the fine of f of a pana for throwing dust on a «**■*

for doing the same on a royal road ; prescribes a fine of one, 
two, three or four panas respectively for voiding ordure on or 
near a holy place, or a place whence water is taken, or a temple 
or the king's buildings and exempts from fine such persons as 
those mentioned in Manu IX. 283. Kat. ( 758-759 ) provides 9 ' 8 
that he who defiles a tank, a garden or holy water ( or ghats ) 
by throwing filthy matter ( ordure &c. ) therein should be made 
to remove the filth and fined the first amercement and also one 
who pollutes by washing soiled clothes in holy and purifying 
sacred places {ghats &c.) established by great or saintly persons. 
Yaj. IL 155 prescribes the first, the highest and middling 
amercements respectively for making breaches in the boundary 
( between two or more fields ), for ploughing a field beyond the 
boundary of one's field and for depriving a man of his field 
by intimidation and the like. Vide also Visnu Dh. S. V. 172 
and Sankha-Likhita 919 who prescribe a fine of 1008 panas for 
transgressing ( the whole of ) the boundary ( of a field ). Manu 
VUL Wl ( = Matsya 227. 30 ) provides a fine of 200 panas 
for seizing another's field, garden or house through inadver- 
tance, but 500 for seizing any one of these by intimidation 
Nar. XIV. 13-14 and Kat. ( 760-761 ) state 9 * that the fruits and 
flowers of those trees that grow on the boundary between two 
fields should be declared (by the Judge) as joint between the 
owners of the two fields and that if the branches of trees grow- 
ing in one man's field spread over another man's field that man 
should be understood to be the owner of the trees and branches 
( together with fruit &c. ) in whose field the trees are born (have 
taken root). The first proposition implies that if one owner

prescribe that one should make a dike or watercourse on an- 
other's land with the permission of that man or with the permis- 
sion of the king as otherwise he cannot reap the benefit thereof. 
Kat ( 762-63 ) provides a similar rule about the repairs to a 
house or garden or tank made by a stranger without the owner's 
or the king's permission It is stated by Nai ( XIV. 23-25 ) that 
when the owner of a field is unable (to cultivate it) or is 
dead or is not heard of, if a stranger cultivates the field 
without objection from any body, the stranger shall enjoy 
the produce of the field, that if the owner (or Ms son) 
returns while the field is being tilled by a stranger, he can 
get his field back on repayment to the stranger of all the 
money expended on making the land (ready for crops). If 
the owner is unable to return the expenses, the stranger, may 
retain 5 th of the produce every year for eight years giving 
3th to the owner every year and should hand over the field to 
the owner when the 8th year arrives Yaj II. 158 and Vyasa 
provide that if a person takes a field from the owdbt on rent 
foi cultivation, but gives up the cultivation after slightly 
ploughing it and does not employ someone else to complete the 
cultivation, then he should be made to pay the produce that 
would have been recovered from the field if properly cultivated 
and also should be fined and the field may be taken from him 
and given to another tenant w .

CHAPTER XXIII 

VAKPA1U1SYA AND DAMDAPSRUSYA 

( Abuse and defamation ; assault) 

Vakparasya, dandap&rusya, steya, strTsangrahana, aahasa 
are five titles out of 18 that aTe concerned with what may be 
called criminal matters or crimes in modern nomenclature. 
Vide under sahasa below. 

Nar. XVIIL 1 defines mkparusija a8 ' abusive words that 

loudly proclaim censure of another's country, caste, family and 

the like and that cause mental pain or offence to that man.' 

Kat. (768) defines it as 922 consisting in making the sound 'hum* 

(of defiance) before another or coughing before him, of imitating 

or uttering before another whatever is censurable according to 

popular notions. Nar. (XVm. 2-3) says that abuse is of three 

kinds, msthira{ reproachful such aB calling a man a fool or a 

rogue), ailito (obscene or insulting), tlwa (mercilessly severe such 

as charging a man with such grave sins as brahmana-murder or 

drinking liquor) and that the punishment for each later one is 

more severe than for each preceding one. Examples of the 

abuse of country, caste and family are lespeotively ' the Gaudas 

are quarrelsome ', ' brahmanas are extremely greedy ', ' persons of 

the Visvamitra gotra commit cruel deeds '. Br. ( S. B. E. vol, 33 

p. 355 verses 2-4) divided vakparusya into three kinds viz. 

lowest (when the country, caste or family of a person is abused 

or sinfulness is ascribed without specifying any definite act), 

middling (speaking that the abuser will have sexual inter. 

course with the mother or sister oi the abused or ascribing the 

commission of upapatakas™ or minor sins to the abused), 

highest (charging him with taking forbidden food or drink or 

mercilessly exposing or ascribing the grave sins to a person). 

Various fines are prescribed in the smrfcis that depend upon the 

above distinctions and als o on the castes of the abuser and the

imputation is false all provide for a fine double of that pro- 
vided in case the imputation is true. Ironic praise of a man 
(such as describing one who is blind of one eye as one endowed 
with a beautiful eye) ib made punishable by Kaut. (331. 18). 
To warn 928 a man against associating with a person who is 
guilty of a grave sin or of theft does not entail punishment if 
the truth of the imputation he established (Kat. 776). Ace to 
Kaut and Kat (775) the king was to awaid only half the fine 
prescribed if the accused said 'what I uttered in abuse was done 
through ignorance, carelessness, rivalry or friendship ; 1 shall 
not again do so' 929 . A pereon who abuses a king doing his 
duty was to have his tongue cut off or forfeited all his property 
(Nar XVHL 30, Taj. H. 303 ). Ap. H. 10. 27. 14 prescribed for 
a sudra that abusad any one of the three higher castes leading 
a religious life the punishment of the cutting of the tongue 930 . 

DaydapBrusya ( assault). Kaut HL 19 begins his treatment 
of this topic by saying that it comprises touching, threatening to 
strike and actually striking another 931 . Nar. XV3JL 4 defines it as 
injuring the limbs of another with the hand, foot, weapon or other 
means ( such as stones ) or defiling or causing pain by ( bringing ) 
ashes and similar substances in contact with another. The Mit. 
on Yaj H. 213 explains that even causing injury to animals and 
trees would fall under this title Mr XVHL 5-6 provide that 
assault-maybeofthree kinds viz. mild, middling and highly W 
punishable according as a person merely makes preparations to 
assault or attacks wrthout any qualm or causes a wound and that 
this enme can further be divided into three kinds according as 
tiie object attacked is low in value or middling 0I high A vers* 
from the Parisista ( quoted by Sm. C. H. p. 327 and V P p 3W ) 
states whoever causes pain or draws blood, wounds, breaks, cuts 
off, purees (the hmbs or bodies) of living beings is guilty of 
dandapamsya' According to Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p 357 verse

the pain or injury caused by the offondct 1,o a man or bea«t. A few 
examples may be set out. Probably the eldest reference to fines 
for assault in Sanskrit literature is contained in Hie Taittiriya 
Samhita 9J7 IJ G 10. 2 . ' He who threatens to all ike a brahmana // 
shall be fined with a hundred (cows or niskas ' ), ho who sti ikes a v ' v ^ 
brahmana shall be fined with a thousand , he who draws blood 
from him shall not behold the jnlrs for as many years ok there 
are particles ot dust mixed with the blood that fallu on them *• 
This passage is interpreted in Jai B3 93S 4 17 as being a rocom- 
mendatary induction (/Mmsa/Ww) to all at all times to desist / 
from assaulting a brahmana. Gaut (21 20-23 ) and Maim XI. w 
206-207 appear to take theTai. S passage diffeiently and refer the 
figures of 100 and 1000 to years Kaut in 19 prescribes various 
fines for various kinds of assaults Br (S. B. E 33 p 357 verses 2, 3 
and 7 ) says that if a person throws ashes or the like at another 
or beats him with the hand the fine should be one mayi, but it 
he strikes with a brick, stone or stick the fine should be two 
masakas ; this however applies when both aie of the same castei 
but if he absaults a woman who is another's wife or a person 
of a higher caste, the fine may be higher and higher For 
one who bruises the skin of another or draws blood by assault 
the fine is one hundred panas, and for him who causes a 
wound by removing some flesh the fine is six masakas and 
he who causes breaking of bones should be banished (Manu V31I 
284 = tfar XVIII 29) Kat prescribes the highest amerce-

person who is alone, each one was to be sentenced to twice the 
punishment prescribed for the offence (Yaj II 231 Kaut 5 * 
m 19, Visnu Dh. S. V 73) Kaut. m 19, Manu VEL 287, 
Yaj H. 222, Br., Kat 787, Visnu Dh S. V. 75-76 provide that the 
king should make an offender pay a fine and also the expenses 
of medical treatment and diet till the wound is healed up and 
the person attacked is able to do his usual work (vide note 613 
above) For mischief to property 9 " and for killing or maim- 
ing animals, Kaut., Manu, Yajnavalkya _ and others provide 
various fines. For example, Kaut. HL 19 prescribes that when 
property of small value is destroyed by a man he should be 
punished with fine equal to the value of the artiole and should 
be made to restore the article or its value to the owner; but m 
the case of articles of substantial value the fine is double of the 
value. Manu Vin 288 is of similar import. Yaj n. 223 provides 
varying fines if a person wrongfully causes damage to a wall by 
knocking it (with a club), or pierces it or divides it into two 
or demolishes it and makes the offender pay to the owner the 
cost of restoring it Manu. VIH 296-298, Ya] H -125-226 
prescribe fines for causing death or injury to animals of small 
value (such as goats) and big animals like elephants, horses 
and cows Yaj II 227-229, Kaut IH 19, and Kat 793 provide 
fines for causing loss by injuring or felling trees, shrubs and

dust or saliva or filthy things on another or strikes with his 
feet, he should not be fined if he is under the influence of 
intoxicants at the time or is not in his right mind or does it 
through mistake, while Kant. IE 19 prescribes half of the usual 
fine in such cases. 

An important question is how far the right of private 
defence of person or property was recognised by the dharma- 
Sastra works. This subject has partly been dealt with in H. of 
Dh. toI. EL pp. 148-151 in connection with an atatdym (a desperate 
man) who is an incendiary or a poisoner or is anned with a 
weapon, is a robber, one carrying away another's wife or seizing 
by force (a field). Although there is great diversity of views 
about killing a brahmana atatayvn, there is no difference of 
opinion as to repelling with force culminating even in death 
an SttOSym. of any other caste. Gaut. YSL 25 allows even a 
brahmana to arm himself when his life is in danger. 943 , Baud. 
Dh. S. JL m 2. 80, Manu VUL 348-349 lay down that hrahmanas 
and vaisyas may oppose with force when they are prevented 
from doing their religious duties by felons or when there are 
disturbances caused by invasion or the like, for saving their 
own lives, for preventing the seizure of their cows or other 
wealth or for protecting women or hrahmanas. The Mit. 945 on 
Taj. IL 286 remarks that these rules of Manu are applicable 
when there is no time to report to the king or when delay in 
opposing violence will mean loss or ruin. According to Hat. 9 * 6 
( 800 ) no blame attaches to a man who kills wicked men that 
are about to kill another, but when they have desisted from 
their attempt, they should be arrested and not killed. Apararka 
( on Yaj. UL 227 ) remarks that persons aTe to he regarded as 
atatfiyin while they are about to set fire or to kill or they 
are in the act of setting fire or killing and the like, that 
where it is not possible to prevent them from doing what

caste was killed in the exercise of such right there ib no punish- 
ment at the hands of the king and the prayascitta (for killing 
a brahniana) is a light one Similarly a man cm kill with

CHAPTER XXIV 
STEYA (theft). 

In the Rg. there^ is frequent mention of taskara, stem 
aritayu In Rg. VI. 28 3 the sage 948 says *may the cows 
not disappear from us, may a thief not injure them '. In Rg. 
VIII 29. 6 it is said 'Pusan guards the ways and knows of 
concealed treasures as a thief does ' From Rg X. 4 6 it appears 
that thieves were desperate and hound people with ropes and 
(fromRg 1. 191 5 ) that thieves {taskaras) appeared at night. 
Tatju (thief) occuis in Rg I 50 2, IV. 38. 5, VL IS 5 and is an 
Indo-Jranian word. The word ' stena ' occurs in Rg. VI 28. 7 and 
means 'one who is a cattle-lifter". Rg. VIII. 67 14 indicates 
that a stena was bound with ropes (when caught). In Rg VIL 
55. 3 the dog is asked to run after a stena and a taskara, the 
first heing probably a thief (who secretly carries away pro- 
perty ) and the second a thief who openly carries it away. In 
the Vaj 9 «« S XI. 79 (=Tai. S. TV. 1. 10 2) we have the malimlu 
in addition to stena and taskara. Atharvaveda IV. 3 contains 
charms against wolves, tigers and thieves (taskaras). 

Steya is distinguished from saham in Manu VIJL 332, Kaut 

IIL 17, Nar. XVIL 12 and other works as stated under sahasa 

below Kat 810 defines 9 * 8 * it as ' depriving a man of his wealth 

either clandestinely or openly and either by night or by 

day '. Nar XVII 17 defines it as ' deprivation of wealth by 

various means from people that are asleep, careless or 

intoxicated'. It may be of three kinds according to the 

value of the thing stolen viz. trifling (when earthen-ware, seats, 

cots, wood, hides, grass, beans in pods or cooked food is stolen) 

or middling (when the theft relates to clothes except silken

cut-purse, one who steals (or kidnaps) a woman or a 
man, cattle, horses and other animals. Yaj n. 266-268 
and Nar. (parisista 9-12) indicate the various ways in 
which thieves may be detected and caught viz by the (police) 
officers recovering a part of the booty from a man or by 
tracing foot-steps, or by seizing one who has been often 
found to be a thief, or by finding out that the man 
suspected cannot state his place of residence; and they 
recommend that on suspicion others may be caught, if on being 
questioned they attempt to conceal their caste or name or if they 
are found addicted to gambling, wine and women or if their 
mouth becomes dry or their voice changes or if they spend 
lavishly though they have no ostensible means of earning, or 
those who sell lost or second-hand goods or who move about in 
disguise or who are found making inquiries about others' houses

warning that the king must carefully examine whether the man 
caught is really the thief and should not convict merely on 
suspicion, since esen an innocent man may have stolen property 
near him or betray some of the signs noted above. When pro- 
perty alleged to be stolen is found with a man, it may be that 
the articles came to his hands from another's hand or he may

that one who ib not a thief may be held to be a thief as in the

be acquitted on his mere denial d£ the offence He had to prove

According to ffar (parisista 23-24) for thefts of articles of

( VUL 326-329 ) said it was twice as much as the price. Gaut

the article stolen, the vaisya, ksatriya and brSbmana thieves 
were respectively fined 16, S2 and 64 times the price of the 
article, as each is deemed to know better owing to his higher 
status and culture. Manu V2H 380 lays down the general rule 
that a brahmaua offender was not to be killed whatever the 
offence might be but he was to be banished from the country 
allowing him to take with him all his wealth. But there were 
other provisions and exceptions also. Eat ,56 ( 833 ) states that

the school of the Manavas deolaTed that thieves caught with 

the stolen things on them should he at once banished hut that 

the school of Gautama disapproved of this mode, since it is 

condemned because it entails loss ( reduction ) of people in the 

country The V. B. p. 332 explains this verse as referring to a 

learned brahmana. Two more verses of Kat. (834-835) are 

quoted by V. R p. 332 and V. O. p 92 the first of which provides 

that a brahmana who is not learned whether caught with booty 

or not should be branded (with the appropriate signs) and 

deprived of all his property, provided his guilt is brought home 

with certainty and the second provides that a brahmana thief 

who is neither learned nor rich but is strongly built should be 

kept under guard with fetters on his feet, should be fed on 

meagre food and made to do hard labour for the king till his 

death Gaut. XH. 46-48, Nar. ( parisista 13-14 ), Manu IX. 271 

and 278, Kat ( 827 ) hold that the punishment for those who 

knowingly give food, fire (when they feel cold), water or 

asylum to thieves or who receive or purchase stolen property 

ot who conceal them are to be punished like the thieves 

themselves 957 Yaj DL 276 prescribes the highest amercement 

for any one who knowingly gives help to a thief or murderer 

in the above ways or by directions or by supplying tools 

or money wherewith to go to a place for committing the 

offence.

Ap.Dh S w (I 10 28 1-5) contains a discussion from which 
it appears that Kautsa, Harlta, Kanva and Paskarasadi were of 
the opinion that whatever (however trifling or m whatever 
circumstances ) a man took without the consent of the owner, he 
became a thief, that Varsyayam held that there were exceptions 
to this rule viz. that owners should notforbid the taking (of a small 
quantity of) grain in pods (such as mudga or masa) or grass for 
bulls yoked to carts, but that if large quantities even of these were 
taken there would be theft. SSnti 165. 11-13, Manu XL 16-18 
and Ya] HI. 43 state that when a brahmana or other person has 
fasted for three days because he has had no grain with him, he 
may on the 4th day take grain for one day's meal from any- 
where he can get, whether from a threshing floor or from a 
field or a house, and that if the owner questioned he should 
declare to him the reason, but a person of a lower caste should 
not in this way take grain belonging to one of a higher caste, 
unless the latter pursues a sinful course or does not perform 
the duties of his caste. Vyasa quoted by Sm. 0. 1 p. 175 allows 
a man to commit even theft, when he is in distress for food, 
first from a person of a lower caste, then from one of the same 
casce and then from one of a higher caste Manu VJXL 341 
( = MatBya 227. 110, 114 ), Nar ( praklrnaka 39 ), Sankha and 
Kst ( 822A ) state that a traveller whose food has run out may

Saliasa (crimes of violence), ManuVTH 332, Kant III 17, 
Nar.XVH l.Yaj H. 330, Eat. (795-796) define sahasa 961 as 
any act which is done with violence in defiance of or in spite 
of the presence of royal officers or guards or people The word 
sahasa is a derivative from 'sahas' meaning 'force' (Nar 
XVII 1). Sometimes it is distinguished from theft (as in 
Mann Vm. 332, Kant HL 17 and Nar. XVIL 13) by saying 
that theft consists in depriving a person of his wealth stealthily 
(without force), while in sahasa there is the use of force or 
violence 963 . Nar. XVIL 2 and Br (SB. E. vol 33 p. 359 verse 
1) state that sahasa 964 is of four kinds viz manslaughter, theft, 
violence to the wives of others, and the two kinds of parusya 
(treated as one head). Although these topics can be compre- 
hended under sahasa, they are generally dealt with separately 
in the smrtis and digests as a matter of convenience and in 
order to provide heavier punishment for crimes of violence 965 , 
since a man guilty of a crime of violence is a worse sinner 
than one guilty of abuse, theft or assault (Manu TITT, 345 a nd 
Mit. on Yaj. IL 230) and Manu Vm 244 enjoins upon the king 
not to tolerate for a moment a man guilty of violence The

V May. (text p 2) says that in differentiating steya from 
Hithasa the maxim of 'cows' and 'hulls' is applicable' 66 . 

Sahasa is divided by Nar. XVII 3-6 and Br (S B JC 33 
p 363 veise 24 ) into three varieties, viz. the lowest (destruction, 
abuse and trampling of fruits , roots, water, agricultural imple- 
ments), middling (destruction &c of clothes, food and drink, 
household utensils ), highest (killing with weapons orpoiBon, 
violence to others' wives and whatever causes pain to sentient 
beings) These three kinds are respectively punished with the 
three kinds of punishments described above (pp. 393-94) The 
principal crimes included under sahasa in its narrow sense are 
homicide, rape and robbery Bape will be dealt with under 
itiisanqmhana Br. 967 states the general rule that one guilty 
of murder by violence should be punished with death and 
not with fines ( S B. E 33 p. 363 v 29 ) To this the brahmana 
offender was an exception (Manu IX. 241 ), who was only to 
be banished Manu IX 242 introduces another exception viz. 
persons other than brahmanas when guilty of the great 
sins ( specified in IX 235) through negligence should be only 
deprived of all thoir pioperty but if they murder a man inten- 
tionally then only aie they to be sentenced to death. Manu 
IX. 232 and Visnu Dh S V 9-11 provide the punishment 
of death for those who fabricate false royal edicts, or who 
tamper with the loyalty of the elements of the State > or who 
kill women, children and brahmanas Baud Dh S I iu.

punishment appropriate to the crime and the strength of the 
offender In IV. 11 Kaut. provides sentences of death in various 
ways for murder following ancient sastras, but remarks that if 
murderers have not been guilty of cruelty they should simply 
be sentenced to death without torture or the like 9 *. One 
special rule deserves notice Gaut 22 12, Ap Dh. S. I. 9. 24

as for one who kills a brahmana male. The different meanings 
of 'atreyi' given from ancient times are noted below 979 . Texts

sniHt is variously explained The word occurs as early as the Sat Br I. 4, 
5, 13 where in explaining why the offerings to Prajapati are made in a low 
tone a legend about the goddess 'Vac' is narrated and it is said that m having 
sexual intercourse with an atreyi, a man incurs sra' ( tWU^iqi ifcarr ^f^f^St). 
Here the word appears to mean a woman who is in her monthly illness 
Vas ( Z0 33-36 ) defines atreyi as a woman who has taken the punBcatory 
bath on the 4th day after her monthly illness begins and derives the word 
from sra ' 3W^f WSVRif VUMrimdMldlUljfcftng'. I 3tW BJST^iRT iH ifi Gl . ' 
Vasistba either cites or summarises a Vedic passage { as stated by Visvariipa) 
which means ' here (i e in the womb of this woman ) a child is to come \ 
In SBE vol. 14 p 107 the same is translated as ' if the husband approaches 
her at that ( time } he will have offspring ' But this is not correct ' Esyat ' 
qualifies ' apatyam' and is not in the masculine. Vas derives the word from 
an* and tne root ^ Visnu Dh S 36 1 and 50 9 appear to hold that atreyi means 
a woman of the Atngotra Haradatta on both Gaut. and £p explains atreyi 
as Vaststha does and states that others interpreted it as ' snf=t»fnn >. on in- 
III 251 (^iScTlPtijjJ*- ) TC*3^n explains 3tt§ift as a woman within 16 days

murderer and the murdered These will be briefly- dealt with 
undei pi&yascitta later on In certain cases ace. to Manu Vm 
291-292, Yaj II 298-299, Kaut IV 13, though death or injury 
to persons or loss of property results, no punishment was pres- 
cribed viz when the nose-string of bulls yoked to a cart snaps, 
when the yoke breaks, when the cart swerves on one side owing 
to the unevenness of the ground, when the axle or wheel breaks 
<n when the leather thongs with which the several parts of the 
cm t are tiod give way, or when the rope cast round the necks 
of bulls or the reins break or when in spite of the driver loudly 
calling upon a person to move aside from the way an accident 
occurs But Manu VHL 293, 294 (=Matsya 227. 95-96) pro- 
vide th.it wheie through the want of skill of the driver know- 
ingly engaged by a master the cart is overturned and injury is 
o.niBcid, the master should be fined 200 panas, but if the driver 
employed be known to be skilful, then when injury is caused 
the di ivei should be fined ( and not the employei ) Further if 
the driver, though seeing that the road is blocked by cattle or 
other caits, rashly drives and kills men and animals he should 
lw punished (Manu VH. 295) It is stated by Nar (parusya 
Al,S B. E vol 33 p 212) that the father is not liable for his 
son's offence, nor is the owner of a horse, dog or ape liable to 
punishment (for injury caused by any of these) provided they 
.lie not set up (to do harm) by the owner. If a drivei kills 
•i man by lash or negligent driving he is to be punished like a 
tluef. if he kills any one of the larger animals (such as a cow, 
a hoise, a camel or elephant) the punishment would be half of 
the preceding, if he kills one of the inferior animals, the fine 
would be two hundred Kaut 131 19, Manu (VIE 285), YSj.

Various rules were laid down about inciters or abettors 
Yaj H. 231 and Kaut m HL 17 prescribe for the man who 
incites another to crimes of violence double the punishment to 
be inflicted on the perpetrator himself and four times for one 
who incites another by assuring Mm ' I shall give as much 
money as will be required '. Eat. (798) and Br 972 (S. B E 33 p 363 
veis 31 ) prescribe that if several violently beat a man to death, 
he who gives the fatal blow on a vital part is declared to be the 
murderer and is to suffer the full punishment for murder. Kat 
( 832-834 ) «3 and Br. (S B E. 33 p. 364 verse 32) provide that he 
who commences a crime of violence, who is a helper, who givep 
advice as to the way ( in which sahasa is to be carried out ), who 
gives refuge ( asylum ) to the offender or supplies weapons, who 
gives food to wrongdoers, who incites ( offenders ) to put up a 
fight, who shows how the person ( killed ) is to be destroyed, who 
connives ( at the commission of an offence ), who exposes the 
faults (of the person killed), who gives his approval (to the 
offence ), who though able does not forbid or prevent the com- 
mission of the offence— all these are ( practically ) perpetrators 
of the crime and the king should award punishment accord- 
ing to their ability and their guilt. Vide also iLp Dh. S

CHAPTER XXV 

STEISAKGRAHAtfA. (Adultery or unlawful intercourse 
with a woman ). 

The Mit. ( on Yaj. 3L' 76 283 ) states that mnqiahana means 
the unlawful coming together of a man and a woman for sexual 
enjoyment. Br. (S B. E. 33 p 365 verses 1-2) says that sinful 977 
santpiihaya is of three kinds, viz. brought about by toce, deceit 
or sensual passion. The first ( which is rape ) occurs when 
intercourse is had in a becluded place against the will of a 
woman, or with a woman who is intoxicated or is disordered 
in mind or is under a mistake or when she raises a cry ; the 
second occurs when a woman is brought to one's house by 
some trick or pretence, an intoxicant (such as Dhatma) is 
administered to her or her mind is brought under control { by 
chants or otherwise ) and sexual intercourse takes place ; the 
third occurs when intercourse takes place by conveying 
( passion ) to each other by means of the eyes ( glances ) or by 
employing a go-between and when the parties are drawn to 
each other by the temptation of beauty or of wealth This 
last is again of three kinds ace to Vyasa and Br. ( S. B. E. 
33 p. 365-66 verses 6-8 q. by Sm. 0. IL p. 8 ) viz. trifling, 
middling and grave The first is characterised by winking 
at a woman, smiling at her, sending a go-between, touch- 
ing her ornaments or clothes; the second by the sending 
of flowers, unguents, fruits, incense, food, clothes, and 
indulging in private talks; the third is characterised by 
lying on the same bed, dalliance, kissing and embraces. Strl- 
sangrahana by force (that is rape ) is really included under

•with a woman of a higher caste the male shall be put to death 
and the woman shall have her ears and the like cut off. Vide 
Shakespeare's Othello IV. 1, where Othello exclaims 'I see that 
nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to ' There were 
other sages who were humane and opposed to the punishment 
of disfigurement by way of the cutting of the ear or the nose. 
Yarna' 583 " states that in the case of a woman guilty of adultery 
at her will, there was to be no punishment of death or disfigure- 
ment, but only abandonment. Kat ( 487 ) lays down the general 
rule that in all offences women should be sentenced to half the 
fine in money which is prescribed for a male and that when the 
punishment is death for a male the punishment for a woman 
would be cutting off a limb (vide note 626). 

Nar. (XV. 73-75 ) holds 983 that sexual intercourse with the 
step-mother, mother's sister, mother-iu-law, the paternal or 
maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, a friend's or pupil's wife, 
sister, sister's friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of 
one's, vedic teacheT, a woman of the Bame gotra, a woman 
that has sought protection, with the queen or an ascetic woman 
(pravi-ujila) or a wet-nurse or a virtuous wif e(sadJwl) or a woman of 
a higher caste is incestuous and the punishment to be prescribed 
for this crime is the excision of the penis and no less. Vide

and Matsya 227. 141 deem it a most heinous offence Tho 
explanation probably lies in the fact that Kant and Ya] refer 
to female ascetics of the lowest castes not following the 
orthodox religion, while Nar. refers to nuns of a higher order 
Vide Manu VEX 363 also. For forcible intercourse witli a

S. V. 6. 8 3) 9SS not to approach a svidra woman and after he 
performed Agnicayana twice he was not to approach another's 
wife ( H of Dh vol. IL p. 1255 ). 

The punishment for sangrahana (rape and adultery) varied 
according to the caste of the man and the woman, according as 
the woman was married or unmarried and according as she was 
guarded (gupta) or unguarded. Vide Gaut. XIL 2, Vas XXI,

against guarded or unguarded woman), Manu VUI. 364-370, 
Yaj. H 285, 287, Kaut IV. 12, Nar. XV. 71-72 ( ahout maidens ). 
Further the ancient sutras and smrtis prescribe more severe 
sentences than later smrtis. Details of these matters are passed 
over here for want of space and as being now of academic 
interest only. But some examples may be noted. Gaut. XXIII. 
14-15 and Manu VUL 371 prescribe for an adulteress death by 
being devoured by dogs, but Yaj IL 286 softened the rigour of 
this Ap. Dh. S. (H 10. 26. 20-21) prescribed the penalty of 
cutting the penis and testicles for the male if guilty of adultery 
with a married woman, but only confiscation of all property if 
he committed adultery with an unmarried woman. But Yaj IL 
288, Manu VDL 366, Nsr. XV. 72 went so far as to say that if a 
man had sexual intercourse with a maiden ( of the same caste ) 
who encouraged his advances, then there is no offence punishable 
by the king, but he was to bestow ornaments on her, honour her 
and must marry her

The rights of partition, inherence and maintenance will be

and men and other related matters are described Under this 
head Nar. speaks of the essential ceremonies of marriage, the 
rules about selecting a bride and a bridegroom, restrictions as 
to the caste of the bride, the guardians for marriage, faults or 
defects in a proposed bride or bridegroom, the forms of marriage, 
women called punarbfiu and svainni, the practice of myoga, illicit 
sexual intercourse, punishment of women for adultery, re- 
marriage, uirnasankara, mixed castes. In IX 1 Manu promises 
that he will dilate upon the obligatory duties of man and wife, 
whether they are staying together or apart. Manu IX. 2 holds 
that the first duty of the husband and the males in his family is 
to keep women dependent and under their control if they become 
attached to a life of pleasure and Nar. XVL 30 states that even 
women of good family come to rum by independence The next 
most important matter ace to Manu IX 5 and Br. ( S B. E. 33 
p 367 verse 2 ) 990 is to guard women against improper attach- 
ments however trifling, since if they go astray they bring sorrow 
to both families ( of the husband and of the father ). Ace to 
Harlta, 991 Sankha-Likhita, 992 Manu (IX 7,9) and others the 
husband has to guard the wife from the approaches of other men 
in order to ensure the purity of the issue and by guarding her 
the husband guards his reputation, family, soul and his dharma,

since a woman gives birth to a son similar to the male with 
whom she consorts or on whom she sets her heart during the 
days after the monthly illness. Here there is some anticipa- 
tion of modern Eugenics. Manu IX 10 was quite clear that 
women could not be completely guarded by confining them 
with force in seclusion, that their minds must he occupied in 
family woik as stated by him in IX 11 and by Br. ( S. B. K 33 
p. 368 " 3 verse 4 ), that the husband must try to deserve her 
regard and affection and show her honour ( Manu IX. 22-24, 26,

CHAPTER XXVI 

DYUTASAMAHVAYA 
( Gambling and pnze-fighting ) 

Manu IX. 223, Nar. XIX. 1 and Br. (S B. E. 33 p. 385 verse 
3) define dyuta (gambling) as that spoit which is carried on 
with inanimate objects such as dice, pieces of leather, ivory and 
the like and in which there is a stake, while sport carried on 
with animate objects such as cocks, pigeons, rams, buffaloes and 
wrestlers is called samalwcaja The attitude of Manu towards 
gambling was uncompromising. Manu ( IX 221-222, 221-226 ) 
calls upon the king to suppress gambling and pnze-fighting 
in his country as they cause the destruction of the State; 
he states that gambling is open theft and therefoie the kmg 
should endeavour to put it down and that the king should punish 
with corporal punishment all those who engage in gambling 
or who induce or help others to gamble, and that h* should 
banish gamblers from the city because gamblers residing in 
.the country harass wellconducted subjects by their deceitful 
tricks. Manu IX. 227 ( « Udyogaparva 37. 19) states that 
in ancient times gambling engendered great enmities ana 
therefore a wise man should not resort to it even for amusement 
or in jest. Kat (934) is to the same effect Y5j H. 203 and 
Kaut. IIL 20 '« allowed gambling in a central place under 'Matt 
supervision as it led to the deteotion of thieves Br t& • 
E 33 p. 385 verse 1 ) refers to this divergence of views: tram- 
bl'ing that causes loss of truth, purity ^ d ^f"V£t

gambling hall which gamblers made their haunt and who sup- 
plied the dice and other instruments of gambling was called 
sabhika and the stake or money agreed to be paid by the 
defeated gambler to the winning gambler was called jxmu, or 
glaha ( Yaj II 199 ) Nar. XIX. 8 provides an optional method 
viz. instead 996 of gambling in a hall presided over by a 
sabhika, gamblers may give the king his share in the stakes, 
then indulge in gambling openly and if they do so they incur 
no punishment. Ace. to Ya]. II. 199 as interpreted by Par. 
M. HI p. 574 and V. P. p 565 the sabhika was to receive five 
per cent or ^ s th part when the stake was 100 panas or more 
and 10 per cent or xsth when the stake was less than 100 
panas. Apararka ( p. 802 ) explains that the sabhika was to 
receive as his fee five per cent from the victorious gambler 
and ten per cent from the losing gambler.- Nar XIX. 2 prescri- 
bes a flat rate of ten per cent on the stake as the fee of the 
sabhika, while Kaut. 997 in 20 lays down the fee as five per 
cent and allows the sabhika to charge hire for supplying gam- 
bling accessories ( such as dice, leather pieces ) and for sup- 
plying water and accommodation The sabhika receiving protec- 
tion from the king was to pay to the king the tax agreed upon 
by him, was to lecover from the defeated gambler the stake 
( by means of confinement or restraint order ) and pay it over 
to the victor and was to be honest and forbearing 998 (Yaj. II 
200, Eat 940, Nar. XIX 2) Kat (937) states that the sabhika 999 
may give to the winner the money won out of his own pocket 
and may recover from the losing gambler within three fort- 
nights or at once if there is fear of losing the money. Kat (935) 1000 
holds that if gambling was to be allowed it must be carried on 
openly with an arch constructed near the door in order that 
respectable people might not be misled ( about its real nature ) 
and it should yield revenue to the king If the sabhika is

unable to make the defeated gambler pay the stake to the victor, 
the king would make the former pay to the latter provided the 
gambling was done openly in the presence of the sabhika and a 
group of gamblers and the king's dues were paid by the sabhika, 
but not otherwise ( Yaj II 201 ). Nar. XIX 6-7 and Yaj 11 203 
provide that when gambling is carried on secretly and without 
the king's permission or with false dice or other deceitful tricks, 
the gamblers and the sabhika would not be able to gain their 
object ( i e. recovering bets won or the fee ) and would be liable 
to punishment, viz. branding on the head ( with dog's foot and 
the like ) and banishment Nar. XIX. 6 adds that the banished 
gamblers would have wreaths of dice tied round their necks. 
Kat. (941) and Br. (S B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 7) state that a person 
ignorant of gambling should, if defeated in gambling m private, 
be released from his liability, but one who is an adept in 
gambling should not be relieved when defeated , but even an 
adept in gambling if he haB lost the whole of his wealth as a 
stake should not be made to pay the whole. 1001 In disputes 
among gamblers, in deciding on victory or m the matter of 
gain to the winner, and as regards the question of false dice 
the keeper of the gaming house, if honeBt, is the final authority 
( Kat. 942 ). NSr. XIX 4, Yaj. II. 202, Br (S B. E 33 p. 386 
verse 6), Kat. ( 943 ) provide that when there is a dispute as to 
success or defeat the king should appoint gamblers to decide the 
dispute and gamblers will also be'the witnesses in such a dispute 
( in spite of the rule stated above on p. 335 that gamblers are not 
competent witnesses), but if the gamblers are alleged to be 
inimical to the disputants the king may then 1 * 3 himself decide 
the matter. Yaj. II 203 extends all the rules about gambling 
to samahvaya Br. (S. B. E. 33 P 386 verse ^ ) notes that the 
stake is to be paid by the owner of the animal ^* ****

thereon that the king gets one-fourth of the stake from each of 
the owners of the fighting animals and that the animal that 
is defeated ( except a wrestler ot a buffalo ) is to he made over, 
whether living or dead, to the owner of the winner. The 
Manasollasa ( vol. HI. p 229) contains an elaborate description 
of a king's amusements by way of wrestling matches, cook- 
fights &c. The Dasakumaracarita makes frequent leferonce to 
gambling In Ucchvasa II. (p. 47 ) we are told that there are 
25 kalas on which gambling depends, that legal proceedings 
between gamblers were decided by reliance on the sabhika and 
that out of a stake of 16000 dinai as, the successful gambler took 
half and distributed the other half among the sablnbu and the 
denisens of the gambling hall 

Gambling is one of the most ancient vices. Rg. X. 34 is 
a hymn which contains the lament of a gambler. Elsewhere 
also in the Rg. gambling is referred to Vide Rg. I. 41. 9 ( ex- 
plained in Nirakta III. 16 ), VH. 86 6 ( where it is said that dice 
made of Vibhidaka tree are one of the sources of sin), Rg X. 
42. 9, X. 43 5. In the Atharvaveda also dice and glaha 
occur frequently. Vide Atharva IV. 16 5, IV. 38 { a hymn 
for good mck in gambling) In Vaj. S. 30. 18 we have the 
words 'aksarajaya kitavam '. In certain solemn sacrifices 
like the Rsjasuya dice play was an important item. Vide 
H.ofDh vol U. p 1219. Panini teaches the formation of 
many words relating to gambling In H.™s 1. 1 he teaches the 
formation of Avyaylbham compounds like 'aksapari* or 
salakapan m the sense 'that loss was caused by one dice being 
castm a way different from the way in which it was cast 
in a prior game •. In IV. 4. 2 he teaches that « aksikl' meS

bhSratn Yndhisthira ,ow is made to say that it was his vow not 
lo rofuhe dice play when he was challenged to it. It was well- 
known that gambling affects the minds even of the good, while 
in tho case of thobo who were not ordinarily good it led to dis- 
BGiifcioii'j and calamities Many modern people justify the action 
or Yndhislhira on tho ground that tho code of ksatriya chivalry 
and molality of those ancient days required that he should not 
bo af mid to play with dice when challenged by an adversary 
(Joncocling for the sake of argument that indulgence in gambling 
o^cn on the part of biich a virtuous, noble and philosophic 
warrior as Yudhislhira was justified or at least excusable, there 
is nothing to show that tho code of ksatriya chivalry permitted 
luni to gamble away his own spirited, devoted and virtuous 
queen and his four valiant brothers It appears that the real 
aim of the great author of the Mahabharata is to emphasize 
that gambling is such a reprehensible pastime and so ruinous 
and degrading that even the greatest and the best, when once 
(hoy indulge in it, lose all souse of duty, morality and of the 
claims of love and affection. It has already been seen how 
gambling was looked upon as a great vice in tho king by 
writers on politics and also on dharmasastra Even the Puranas 
hero and there condemn gambling For example, the Brahma- 
purana (171. 29-38) condemns it in stiong language It says 
that the gambler's wife is always in enstress and the gambler 
on seeing the condition of his wife is also wo rr ed (tb »»jn 
almost the wmo words as T*g X. 34 10-11), that J^ ™a 
condemns gambling and that there is no sin comparable to

CHAPTER XXVII 

"DAYABHSGA 
( Partition o£ wealth ) 

The word dutja has been used even in the oldest period of 
the Vedic Literature Rg. II. 32 4 ( dadatu efram iafadayum- 
ukUiyam ) has alieady been quoted above ( on p. 388 ) In Rg X. 
114 10 (iiamasi/a d&ytan wbhujantijebhyah ) the meaning of the 
word seems to be ' a shaie ' or ' reward '. In the Tai S and the 
Brahmanas the word daya appears to be employed in the 
sense of ' paternal wealth ' or simply ' wealth ' In the story 
of Nabhanedistha 1010 it is stated that Mauu divided his dai/a 
among (for) his sons' (Tai S in 194) That' daya' here 
stands for ' dhana ' follows from another passage of the Tai S. 
(II 5 2 7) 'Therefore they distinguish (or establish) the elde&t 
son by wealth'. In the Tandya Biahmana 10 " 16. 4 3-5 also it is 
said 'Therefore whoever among (a man's) sons secures the 
best or major portion of wealth as daya, him they regard as the 
son who would be the lord of all'. Another word viz. nkfha 
occurring in the sutra and smiti literature is also employed in 
the Rgveda"" III 31 3 ' the sou of the body does not give to his 
sister the ancestral wealth, but makes her the leoeptacle for 
the bon of her husband' The word dtofrh, (meaning a co- 
sharer, one who takes a share ) occurs frequently in the Vedic 
Literature In the Tai. S VI. 5 8. 2 *»» it is said ' Theief ore

brahmanas Visvamitra invites Sunahiepa to share in the 
spiritual wealth ( daya ) belonging to him ( Ait Br 33 5 ), calls 
upon his sons to follow him and states that he ( Sunahsepa ) 
would accept them, his wealth (daya) and his learning 10,s 
The Nir III 4 quotes or summarizes other Vedic passages m 
which the words daya and dayada occur. In Panmi II 3 39 and 
VI. 2. 5 the word dayada occurs. 

The principal heads discussed under the vyavaharapada called 
dai/abhaga are two, viz partition and inheritance. For at 
least a thousand years there have been two schools that widely 
differ on these two heads , they are respectively known as the 
school of the Mitaksara and that of the Dayabhaga on account 
of the pre-eminent position of these works in the respective 
schools The latter school is predominant in Bengal while the 
former prevails in the whole of India excepting Bengal. But 
even in Bengal there are in modern times families governed by 
the law of the Mitaksara This work in intention and scope 
.does not profess to be a treatise on modern Hindu Law. It 
concerns itself with pointing out what the law of the Smrtis 
and writers of medieval digests was and has to eschew an 
exhaustive discussion of the modern case-law and legislative 
enactments that have made the Hindu Law appear in many 
respects to be enthely different from the law of the commen- 
taries and digests Generally speaking, only very important 
divergences made by legislation and case law in the ancient 
and medieval Hindu Law can and may be pointed out here 

The principal Sanskrit works of the Dayabhaga school are 
three viz. the Dayabhaga of JImutavahana, the Dayatattya of 
Raghnnandana and the Dayakramasangraha of Sri krsna 
Taxkalankara The Mitaksara school is subdivided into four 
SSSSTfa which besides the Mitaksara, the supreme 
authoritv other works are referred to as supplementary to it

The words daya and vibhaga have been variously defined 
in the digests Nar. ( dayabhaga, verse 1 ) defines the vyavahSra- 
pada dayabhaga as one in which sons arrange for the partition 
of their father's wealth. The Madanaratna as noted by the 
V. Mayukha ( text p. 94 ) reads ' arthasya pitryadeh * ( wealth of 
the father and others ) for ' pitryasya ' in Narada's verse The 
Smrtisangraha quoted in the Sm. C. and other works states that 
the word daya applies to wealth that comes to a man through 
the father or the mother and the Nighantu defines daya as the 
paternal wealth that is to be divided. »«« The Dayabhaga the 
Mit. and others explain that ttie words ' pitryasya '( father's ) 
and putraih'(bythesons)in Nar. are only illustrative the 
real meaning being that the word 'dayabhaga' applies wherever 
the wealth of a relative (father, grand-father &c ) is distributed 
among his relatives (sons, grandsons &c ) simply on account

tho ownership of a man m a thine. 

The Mil., tho Par. M., tho Madanaratna, the V. Mayflkha, 
Uio A . P. and other works that follow the doctrines of the Mit. 
divide day a into two varieties viz. n^w/i/*W/ia(unobstructible) 101 » 
and ' sajffft/ilxoid/ia ' ( obslructible ). The first occurs m the 
ease of sons grandsons and gieat-grandsons, who, by the very 
fact of thoir being the sons or grandsons, obtain ownership 
in tho (ancestral) wealth held by the father or the grand- 
father. In this case the exibtence of the father or grandfather 
presents no obstacle (piatthandha) to the son's or grandson's 
taking an interest by the very fact of his birth in the family 
property that is in the hands of the father or grandfather. 
Thorofore this is called apxdibandha daya. But when a man 
takes the wealth of his paternal uncle or a father succeeds to 
tho wealth of his son because the uncle or the son dies issueless, 
it is. sapmlibandha diiya, as in these cases the nephew or the 
father has no right in the uncle's or son's property as long as 
the uncle or the son is alive or as long as the uncle ot son has, a 
son or grandson That is, the life of the owner or the existence 
of a son presents an obstacle to the nephew's or father's succes- 
sion. Hence it is saprahbandlia diiya. 

It is to be noted that the Dayabhaga, the Dayatattva and 
a few other works do not divide daya into two kinds According

to them, all daya is sapralibandha i e. ownership arises in

cessation of the latter's ownership owing to his becoming patdv 
or a M « (ascetic)."* The doctrine of this school is 
called uparamasiatvavada{ ownership arising on death), while 
the school of the Mit.-holds the view of janmasvalvavnda. Inis 
is the great difference hetween the school of the Dayabhaga 
and that of the Mitaksara. The former does not recognise that 
the son, grandson or great-grandson acquires hy hirth any 
right of ownership in the ancestral property held by the father 
or other ancestor. 

The two words ' sum ' and * soamtn ' are correlative, the idea 
underlying both is the same and they are two aspects of tha. 
same question. ' Sva ' means * what belongs to a person ' i. e. 
'property'. It has direct reference to a thing and indirect 
reference to the owner of the thing. ' Svamin ' means ' master 
or owner * and directly refers to the person owning and 
indirectly to the thing. Vide Salmond's Jurisprudence, chap. 
X TT. pp. 339-340 ( 9th ed. of 1937 ) for the idea of ownership. 
According to Siromanibhattacarya svatoa is a separate padartka 
( category) by itself, while others Bay that it is a capacity. 1022

work-Band writers like the Smrtisangraha and Dbaresvara"» 
support the view Those who hold that svatva is known only 
from sastra explain that riktha in Gautama s sutra means 
simply daya and samvibhaga means partition of daya which 
establishes the separate ownership of a person on a portion of 
daya ( Tide V. P. p. 415 ) 102S They further urge that Gautama s 
text does not specifically mention birth as a souroe of ownership. 

Others headed by the Mit. hold that seaiva is apprehended 
from worldly usage and not from sastara Their reasoning is : 
(1) just as "rice effects an ordinary worldly purpose, so svatva 
brings about worldly transactions such as sale. What is not 
owned by a man does not enable him to effect such worldly 
objects and transactions as sale or mortgage. Such matters as 
the Ahavanlya fire that are prescribed by the ssstras are not 
useful in effecting secular purposes, but only sastric ones. The 
Shavamya fire may be used in cooking rice, but that is in 
virtue of its ordinary nature as fire and not in its sastric nature 
of being the Shavanlya fire. I026 (2) Even among Mlecchas and 
lowest peoples who are quite innocent of the knowledge of sas- 
tras, the ideas of ownership arising from transactions of sale 
and the like do exist. Further (3) learned men well-versed in

1025 When a man dies his wealth is the daya which several persons 
may inherit In their case, it becomes their joint property. So their 
ownership, being joint, is denoted by the word 'nklha' The joint owners 
become exclusive owners of definite parts of the daya by partition , thus 
partition is a source of ownership (in this case exclusive ownership of dis- 
tinct parts by several) But if there is a single heir then there can be no 
samubJiaga (partition) and so the source of his ownership is riktha and pot 
samsibbaga. When there are several heirs riktha is on this view a source 
of joint ownership only It must be said that on the hypothesis of Jlmula-

have been known-from times immemorial ( long before fee 
Sis). That is, the recognition of the sources of ownership 
r S Tioi and sastra only systematise* them subsequentty. There- 
for* thesmrtiof Gautama (X.39) only assigns tbe.r proper 
spheres to the several sources of ownership that are already 
well-known (vis. five are common to all, acceptance of gifts i« 
tveculiat to br&hmanas and so on). In this respect it is like the 
grammar of Panini. Ptatai does not create or lay down new 
words but he takes the words already current in the language 
and introduces a system about their formation. Stoaarly 
Gautama only voices a certain fixed system among the several 
sources of ownership. The Mit. and its followers say feat 
Gautama simply repeats the several souices of ownership known 
in ordinary worldly life (as the V. Mayukba says 'lokasiddha- 
karananuvadakam)*. The Mit , Pat. M. EL p. 481, S V. p 402 
and others hold that riktha and samvibhaga in Gautama's sutra 
stand for apratibandha daya and sapratibandha daya respec- 
tively. ,0J8 The Mit. meets the other arguments of its opponents 
by Teplying that in the first place that even ordinary popular 
usage doBB not recognise that the thief becomes the rightful 
owner by simply possessing the thing stolen and that in the 
case where a person says 'this man baB stolen my property' 
there is doubt and dispute whether the man charged has got 
ownership by purchase or the like. 

The purpose of this discussion of the topic whether owner- 
ship iB only known from sastra or is a secular matter is, accord- 
ing to the Mit., as follows :-^Manu XL 193 ( = Visnu Dh. S 54 
28) states that when brahmanas acquire wealth by reprehensi- 
ble actions (such as accepting a gift from an unworthy person 
or engaging in the sale of articles wbich he should not sell} 

1028, The word riktha is often used in the sense of saprattbandha daya 
also as in Gant Xll. 37 (nkthabhaja mam pratikntyuls) and Yij II. 51 {nktha-

they are purified from the Bin by abandoning that wealth, by 
repeating the sacred texts (like the Gayatrl) and by austerities 
If ownership springs from sastra alone, what is earned by a 
person in ways condemned by sastra cannot become the pro- 
perty of that man and so his sons cannot divide, what is not his 
property. But if ownership is deemed to be a secular matter 
(lauktha) then even what is obtained by condemned means 
becomes the property of that man, his sons incur no blame 
( though the acquirer may have to perform penance ) and can 
divide that wealth (which is daya), since Manu X. 115 enume- 
rates daya among the seven approved sources of wealth. The 
Madanaratna does not approve of this. Its reason briefly is 
that Manu XL 193 simply lays down a penance, but does not 
say that wealth so obtained does not become the acquirer's pro- 
perty, that it is on account of this that Manu does not prescribe 
any special fine or punishment for one who acquires wealth by 
fneans of a had gift, as he prescribes for a thief and that what 
is acquired by theft does not become the property of the thief 
and his sons cannot divide it and would incur punishment if 
they do so. V. P. (pp. 433-424) refers to the views of the Mit. 
and the Madanaratna and approves of the views of the former. 

This discussion leads on to the next question, viz. whether 
ownership arises from partition or whether partition takes 
place of what already belongs to oneself (by birth) ltiis 
subject has exeicised the minds of writers on Dharmasastra 
from very ancient times. It should be noted that the difference 
of opinion relates only to the case of sons, grandsons and great- 
.irandsons All writers are agreed that persons other than 
these have no rights by birth a. the wealth of their relative 
Those who oppose the view that sons acquue right by birtu 
argue as follows : — 

M sons have ownership by birth in ancestral property, then, 
on the birth of a son, the father cannot enter upon such relu 
Sous duties as .consecrating Vedic fires (i^"?**™

theory that sows acquire property by birth). Besides, there are 
smrti texts like those of Devala 1025 which expressly negative 
the son's ownership during the father's lifetime. Manu IX. 104 
and Nar. ( d&yabhaga %) enjoining that sons should divide 
wealth after the father goes to heaven (because the sons are 
not masters when the parents are alive, as Manu says) indicate 
that sons have no ownership by birth Moreover svalua is 
apprehended only from sastras (like Gautama), which do not 
expressly enumerate birth as a source of ownership along with 
purchase and the like. Therefore the ownership of the son or sons 
arises on the cessation of the ownership of the previous owner 
( by his death or by his becoming pahla or becoming an ascetic). 
When there is a single Bon, he inherits on the death of the 
lather and there is no necessity of- a partition But when 
there are several sons, they jointly inherit paternal wealth and 
can become exclusive owners of separate parts of the paternal 
wealth by partition alone As this last is the most usual case, 
it is said that soatva arises from partition ( mbhugat soaloam )• 
If this doctrine that ownership arises by partition alone were 
literally interpreted, then an only son inheriting his father's 
property will have no ownership as urged by the Vyavahara- 
nirnaya, since there can be no partition in his case 1030 . 

The arguments advanced by those who hold that owner- 
ship in ancestral wealth arises by birth are as follows . — 

It has been established that ownership is a matter of ordi- 
nary worldly usage. It cannot be denied that it is quite well- 
known to all ordinary people that sons acquire ownership by 
birth. Besides there is the text of Gautama 1031 " the acaryas 
hold that one acquires ownership by birth itself " Moreover 
there are numerous smrti passages like those of Yaj. II 131,

Br (S B B. 33 p 370 verse 3), Kafc. (839), Vyasd and Visnu 
Dh. 1032 S. XVII. 2 whioh expressly state that in the paternal 
grandfather's wealth, the father and the son have equal 
ownership (and so the right of the son must be by birth). 
Those who uphold the son's ownership by birth repel the 
arguments advanced in favour of the opposite theory as 
follows: — The Vedic text enjoining consecration of Vedic 
fires at a certain age indicates that the father has the power to 
spend for religious rites from ancestral wealth even after the 
birth of a son. Similarly as head of the family and its manager, 
the father has independent authority to spend ancestral wealth 
( except immovable property ) for indispensable acts of religious 
duty expressly enjoined by Vedic and Smrti texts and for 
making gifts of affection, for maintenance of the family and 
for ridding the family of distress. Further the father or the 
manager.of the family can dispose of even immovable property 
by mortgage or sale in a season of distress or for the benefit of 
the family and for necessary religious purposes (such as 
sraddhas 10 * 3 etc.) 

Ownership has to be distinguished from possession and 
custody. Farther ownership is of various kinds, such as 
corporeal and incorporeal, sole ownership and joint ownership, 
ownership as trustee and beneficial ownership, vested and 
contingent. Even Western writers on Jurisprudence like 
Austin, Pollock and Salmond, find it difficult to define the exact 
m Ling o f ownership. Austin (Lecture XLVP) defines

SSn X«™71™ or V an estent, which though £ 
v w»S L indefinite Pollock defines ownership as the 
Sytf the p^ef s^nse and disposal allowed by law. But 
£ idTa of ownership does not reouire, according toSanstot 
works on Dharmasastra, that the owner shouldalwayB be able 
Tdo with his property as he pleases. On the "^O" 
sastras lay down restrictions on the ow ner joining upon him 
not to make gifts to the detriment of his family (Tide Yaj. B. 175 
"svam kutumbUvnodhem detjam" and the verse of the Smrti- 
sangraha "na ca soamucyale" quoted in note 963 above). 
Therefore property does not comprise only what one can dispose 
of at one's sweet will, hut what is capable (m appropriate 
circumstances only) of being disposed of as one "* likes. A 
person may be prevented from dealing with his property as he 
likes by the king or by the rules of sastTa, by public opinion, 
by his own inclinations and by the pressure of those around 
him. But what he owns is theoretically capable of being dis- 
posed off by him as he likes. The Madanaratna puts forth the 
illustration that seeds Kept dry in a granary do not sprout, 
yet they have the capacity of sprouting and so are as well 
denominated seeds as others that Bprout. There are various 
grades of the limitations on property, such as the father's 
power, the widow's power and so on. What a person earns should 
belong to him, should be his property. But there are passages 
like Manu VHL 416 and Nar. ( abhyupetyasusrusa, verse 41 ) 
that state 1035 "three are declared to be without wealth viz. the 
wife, the son and the slave ; whatever they earn is for him to

by such an ancient writer as Sabara-svamin 1035 that this passage 
does not deny the ownership of the wife or son in what she or 
he earns, but is only intended to lay down that the wife or son 
cannot independently ( without the consent of the husband or 
father ) dispose of what she or he earns. This view of the text 
of Manu is accepted by the Dayabhaga as well as by the Mitak- 
sara School. The latter holds on the analogy of the interpreta- 
tion of Manu VHL 416 that the tests of Devala, Nar and Manu 
IX 104 which apparently deny ownership (siamya) iain to the 
son during the father s lifetime over property in the hands of 
the father are to be interpreted only as denying the son's power 
of independent dealing with such property during the father's 
lifetime or as referring to the self-acquisitions of the father 
On the other hand the Dayabhaga and the Dayatattva try to 
explain away such passages as those of Taj H 121, Visnu and 
others (quoted above) that speak of the son's ownership by 
birth The Dayabhaga offers two explanations of Yaj IL 121. ,03S 
The first explanation offered by it and taken from Udyota is •— 
If A has two sons B and C of whom O dies first, leaving a son D 
and then A dies, then Taj says that both B (son of A) and D 
( grandson of A ) will be equally entitled to the wealth left by A 
and not B alone, though be is nearer to A than D, because 
both B and D offer pindas of the same efficacy to A in the 
parvana-sraddha and so there should be no difference between 
the two. The words " sadrsam svamyam " refer to this equality 
of the son and grandson. Th e 2nd explanation is that of

HI] Equal ownersMp of falter and son 557 

Dharesvara viz. that when the father desires to make a parti- 
tion, he may distribute his self-acquired property as he likes 
among his sons, but as to the property he got from his own 
father ( i. e the grandfather of his sons ) he has the same 
ownership that Bons have and he cannot make an unequal 
division at his sweet will. The Dayabhaga 1039 rejects the view 
that Yaj. H. 121 enables the son to demand partition of the 
grand-father's property from the father even against the will 
of the latter or that father and son have equal shares in the 
grandfather's property The same remarks apply to the texts 
of Visnu and others viz. that in the grandfather's property 
father and son are equally owners and that the words " tulyam 
svamyam " or " samamamsitvam " do not mean that father and 
son take the same share therein 

From the above discussion it will be clear that the two 
schools of the Dayabhaga and of the Mitaksara weie not started 
by them for the first time, but each had respectable antiquity 
behind it. Stnrtis like those of Manu, Narada and Devala and 
eminent authors like Udyota and Dharesvara had put forward 
the doctrine of upmamasoatoawda, while the Smrtis of Yaj., 
Visnu, Br. espoused the doctrine of janmasmluiwda Visvarupa 
who commented on Yaj (in the first half of the 9th century ) 
holds that ownership arises by birth M «. The Mitaksara further 
supports that theory by citing a sutra of Gautama { utpcUlyama 
etc.) which is not found in the extant Gautama-dharma-sutra. 
This sutra does not occur in Apararka and several other works 
and is stated by Srlkrsna Tarkalankara ( on Dayabhaga L 21 
p 14 ) to be not authoritative ( amula ). These facts emboldened 

™ Sfi fVl iaT J B *° mAke the facile suggestion that it 
was fabricated by Vrjnanesvara or his predecessors (Tagore 
Law Lectures p. 110 ). We have seen that so early a writer as 
Visvarupa was excited over the question whether ownership

of the interpretation put on them by the MitSksarS. It haste 
bo noted that the Dayabhaga ^ does admit that in some (texts? 1 
ownership is stated to arise by birth itself (hvaaljanmarmvelil 
and it explains that the words are not to betaken literally 
hut that birth is said to be the source in an indirect way, as 
the relation of father and son is based upon birth and on the 
death of the father the Bon's ownership arises (therefore though 
ownership directly arises on death, birth may be said to be the 
source of it as the son is the first heir because of his being born 
as a son to the father). The Dayatattva does not say that the 
sutra of Gautama is not authoritative, but explains it away on 
lines similar to those of the Dayabhaga. It may be stated 
hero briefly that the Dayabhaga differs from the Mitaksara 
in fouT mam points:— (1) The Dayabhaga denies the theory 
that property is by birth, while the Mit. accepts it; (2) the 
Dayabhaga lays down that the right to inherit and the order 
of heirs is t" etermined by the principle of religious efficacy, 
while the Mit school holds that blood relationship is the gover- 
ning factor in this matter; (3) the Dayabhaga holds that 
members of a joint family (such as brothers or cousins) hold 
their shares in quasi-severalty and can dispose of them even 
when there is no partition by metes and bounds ; (4) the Daya- 
bhaga holds that even in an undivided family the widow succeeds

the Mit school holds that she does not do so. 

Various attempts have been made to explain why in Bengal 
alone the laws of succession and inheritance should diverge 
materially from the laws prevailing in the rest of India. In 
two learned papeTs 'on the origiu and development of the 
Bengal school of Hindu Law ' contributed to the Law Quarterly 
Review (vol. XXlfor 1905 pp. 380-393 and vol. XXH for 1906 
pp 50-63 ) Mr. Justice Saradacharan Mitra tries at some length 
to advance a theory of his own : ' The commercial spirit of the 
newly formed nation in the eastern corner of the Indian 
peninsula with its deltaic character and nearness to the sea, 
the new ideas which other nations trading with it were bringing 
m every day, the necessary admixture of races in some parts 
of the country, the religion of Buddha which for centuries was 
here the religion of the sovereign as well as of the people and the 
influence of the Buddhistic tantias combined to bring about a 
law of property dissimilar in material respects from the rules 
propounded by Brahmanical sages of old and explained and 
commented upon in the Mitaksara and the books based on the 
same '. His idea is that, as Buddhism profoundly affected the 
position of women and as tantras like the Mahanirvana sub- 
scribed to the exaltation of the feminine element in nature, 
the ancient law of property, particularly in relation to women, 
came to be affected and conceptions of individual ownership, 
of freedom from restrictions on alienation and of the rights 
of females arose in Bengal which were incorporated by Jlmuta- 
vahana in his Dayabhaga. With the greatest respect to the 
learned writer, it must be said that the grounds he urges are 
far from convincing. A thorough examination of his thesis 
cannot be undertaken here for want of space. But a few 
remarks must be made. As regards maritime activity the "West 
coast of India was far more in touch with seafaring and com- 
merce with the West than even Bengal, as the mention of the 
ports of Barugasa (Broach) and Kalliene (modern Kalyan) 
by Greek writers, the finding of hoards of Roman coins and the 
existence of Syrians on the West Coast clearly establish. Bud- 
dhism had spread to central and western India as early ' ( if not 
earlier than) the period when it could have spread to Eastern 
Bengal and Assam. Sanchi, Bhilsa, Bharhut, the Nasik and 
Karla caves bear eloquent testimony to the influence of Bud- 
dhibm in central and western India for centuries before and 
after the Christian era. Besides as Mr. Justice Mitra himself 



<"iv tii&tory of DharmaiMra [ Yd. 

admits 'Buddhism liad not ita own law of property' (Law 
Quarterly Review vol. XXI p. 388) Buddhist countries like 
Burma themselves borrowed their laws of succession and inheri- 
tance from the Manusmrti. VijnSnesvara is far more liberal to 
women than Jlmatavahana, who does not allow any woman to 
succeed as heir unleBS she is expressly mentioned as an heir in 
the smrti texts. The Mahanjrvana-tantra treats a sister and 
stepmother as near heirs and allows even a paternal uncle's 
widow and son's daugther to succeed, but under the Dayabhaga 
these are not at all heirs. One branch of the Mitsksara school, 
viz that of the V. Mayukha in Western India is far more liberal 
about the claims of women than any school. The Marumak- 
katayam and Aliyaeantan law in force in some districts of 
South India and among certain communities like the Nambudri 
brshmanas and Nairs go to the other extreme in their regard for 
women but no one has bo far traced that law to Buddhist or 
Tantric influence. The peculiarity of the Dayabhaga, viz the 
principle of religious effioacy is far more remote from rules 
of affinity given in the Mahanirvana»tantra than the principle 
of consanguinity espoused by the Mitsksara school. Mr, Justice 
Mitra is wrong in his estimate of the age of Jlmatavahana. 
As stated above ( on p. 557 ) Jlmatavahana relies on authors like 
TJdyota and the smrtis of Devala and others It is best to admit 
that no satisfactory explanation can be given of the peculiar 
doctrines of the Dayabhaga. They have an indigenous and 
independent origin and growth,

reference to a portion only ( of the heritage of land and cash ), 
but which is indefinite because it is not possible (for one 
man) to deal specifically with a particular portion (of the 
heritage) since there is nothing to show for certain what 
portion belongs to whom ". The Dayabhaga denies that owner- 
ship jointly arises in all co-sharers (before partition) over 
every portion of the heritage and states that it arises in portions 
of it but there is no certain indication to show which part be- 
Idngs to whom and that the portion of each is made definite and 
ascertained by partition effected by casting a ball or pebble 
on a portion (saying 'this is A.'s exclusive portion' etc.). 
The Dayatattva 10 * 4 ( p. 163 ) criticizes this definition. If before 
partition each of the- co-heirs has ownership in part only of the 
entire heritage, what assurance is there that the allotment of a 
part to one co-heir by means of casting a ball will be as to the 
same portion over which his ownership arose before the parti- 
tion ? The Dayatattva, though differing 10 « from the Mit. as to the 
doctrine of ownership by birth, agrees with it as to the definition 
of vibhaga. The differing definitions of vibhaga given by the 
Mit. and the Dayabhaga lead to different results. Under the 
Mit when there is a joint family of father and sons or grand- 
sons, all these are coparceners and the ownership of the 
coparcenary property is in the whole body of coparceners i. e. 
there is unity of ownership while the family remains joint, no 
coparcener can say that he is owner of a definite share, ,one 
fourth or one fifth etc A coparcener's interest is fluctuating, 
™ c ?*. a *> l % <* bein S enlarged by deaths and is liable to be 
dmumshed by births. It is only on partition that a coparcener 
becomes entitled to a definite share. On the other hand accord- 
ing to the Dayabhaga there is no, ownership by birth, the sons 
on the fathers death constitute a coparcenary but the owner- 
ship of the family property is not in all the sons as a body. 
Etory son takes a defined share, the moment the ownership of 
thefather ceases (owing to death etc ). The share so taken 
does not fluctuate with births and deaths. The sons are 
coparceners m the sense that their possession of the property 



^ 5ST * Kn *^ i<wn«i«i(Mw.nBwp 163. ""ww 



5fi2 Etsfrnn of Dlnai-rruxiSUra [ Vol 

inherited from the father is joint i e. there is unity of possession, 
though there is no unity of ownership. 

According to the Mitaksara sons take by birth an interest 
in ancestral estate. Suppose A is sole owner of an ancestral 
estate and has no issue. In that case there is no coparcenary. 
But the moment a son is bom to him, a coparcenary is started. 
That is, under the Mitaksara the birth of a son starts a 
coparcenary. Under the Dayabhaga there is no coparcenary 
between father and sons as the latter acquire no rights by birth 
even in ancestral property but it may subsist between brothers 
or uncles and nephews Under the Payabhaga, the death ot a 
man may start a coparcenary among his sons ( who will be 
brothers ). 

Partition has two senses, (1) division by metes and bounds 
and (2) separation or severance in interest. Under the Mitaksara 
it is possible to have partition in both these senses The 
members of a coparcenary may define, at a particular moment^ 
the shares that each would be entitled to; but the actual 
division of property by metes and bounds may be postponed 
to a future date and in the intervening period they may enjoy 
the property in common as before. This is clearly brought out 
by the Vyavaharamayukha lD « when it says even m Hie 
absence of joint (family) property severance (of interest ) tafces 
place also by a mere declaration in the form I am separate 
from thee ' ; for severance is merely a particular «^*»»

jjj ] Horn separation may be effected 563 

maytikha has been quoted in Beveral oaseB. What constitutes 
an unequivocal declaration of intention to separate has as usual 
given rise to a good deal of case law -which has to he passed 
over here. Under the Dayabhaga heirs succeed on the death of 
the previous owner in certain definite shares and therefore parti- 
tion has ordinarily only the first sense viz. assigning to the 
copatceneTS Bpecific portions of the property inherited. Another 
way of separating a member 1048 is also mentioned by Manu IX. 
207 and Yaj H. 116, viz. that when a member of the family is 
able to fare for himself and does not desire to have a share in 
the family property, he should be separated by giving him some 
trifle ( as a token ). The Mit. adds that the trifle is given as a 
piece of evidence to prevent his sons claiming a share later on. 

The principal matters to be "discussed under Dayabttga or 
JDUyaviblinga are, as Btated by the Sangraha and the Mit.. four, 
viz. the time of partition, the property liable to partition, the 
mode of partition and the persons entitled to partition 1049 . 

Tvme for partttion. The evolution of the son's right to 
demand a partition has been a process of ages. It would not be 
out of place to say a few words on this topic here. In most 
primitive societies where the patriarchal family system prevail- 
ed, the father had absolute power over the son, it was the son's 
duty to obey the father, alienation of family property was not 
allowed, the father had power over the acquisitions of all 
persons including the Bon and women were incompetent to hold 
property. Faint traces of these can be detected in the Vedio 
literature. The legend of SunahSepa narrated in the Ait. Br 
(33 Iff), where we are told that Ajlgarta sold his son for being 
offered as a victim to Varuna.that Visvamitra adopted Sunahsepa 
as bis son,thoughhehad already a hundred and one sons, and that 
he cursed and disinherited his fifty sons for their disobedience to

his order, indicates that in the days of the Ait Br. it was believed 
that in hoary ages long before it, the father's power over Mb bods 
was absolute. But a caution is necessary. It is possible to 
over-emphasize the legend of Sunabiepa ; it has to be remember- 
ed that it is a mere legend and that the Ait Br. itself shows 
that the conduct 'of Ajlgarta was condemned as most unworthy 
of a decent man even according to the legend, 10SB In modern 
times there are rare instances where parents insure their 
children and then poison them or maim them for earning the 
insurance money. But no ong says that this is usual or that 
modern law allows it. In Rg. 1 117. 17 it is stated that the eyes 
of Rjrasva were put out by his father because the former gave 
a hundred rams to a she-wolf. This is a solitary instance and 
it is probable that the verse has some esoteric meaning or 
refers to some terrestrial or celestial phenomenon. In the 
Kathaka Samhita XL 4 it is said " the father rules over the 
son" {pits pufrasyese). But it must be said that ideas about 
the father's absolute power over the sons lingered on in historic 
times. The Nir. ( in HI 4 ) puts forward the argument of some 
predecessors that daughters did not succeed to the father's 
wealth because women could be donated, sold or abandoned and 
not men, ^hile others said that males also were liable to the 
same treatment as evidenced by the story of Sunahsepa. 
Vasistha ( XV. * ) states that 1052 father and mother have power 
to make a gift or sale of the son or to abandon him We saw

brothers divided all the fathers property among themselves,

rently without any protest from him or m spite of it ; to the 
Tai S HI 1 9 4-5 MSS the version of the same story is ditterent, 
since it is there said that Manu himself divided his wealth 
among his sons and did not give any share of the paternal 
wealth to Nabhanedistha who was away at a teacher s house as 
a vedio student In the Gopatha Brahmana (IV. 17 ) it is said 
"therefore in their childhood sons subsist on their father, while 
in his advancing years the father subsists on the son ". In the 
Sat. 1056 Br < S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 157 ) we read " whence in early 
life the sons subsist on the father... whence in later life, the 
father subsists on his sons". In the Kausltaki Br; TJpanisad 
(B. 15) after describing the symbolical handing over to the 
son of all his physical and mental powers by a father who its 
expecting death it is said that if after this rite the father 
recovers he has either to remain under the son's dominion or go 
out as a wanderer ( a sannyasin ) 1057 From some of the above 
passages, it appears that in rare cases sons divided paternal 
wealth even during the lifetime of the father and against his 
will. The remark of Dr Jolly that " it may be unhesitatingly 
set down as a fact that in the earliest period of Indian Law, 
partition of property was an entirely unknown proceeding" 
( Tagore Law Lectures p. 90 ) goes too far and is not fully 
warranted by Vedic texts Just as the Tai. S. ( BI. 1. 9. 4 ) 10S8 
narrates that Manu distributed his wealth among his sons, it 
also speaks of the eldest son being established with ancestral

wealth. The Ap. Dh.S. (B. 6. 14. 6 and 10-12) refers to both 

theBe passages of the Tai. S. but concludes that equal division 

among sonB is the proper mode and that giving a major part of 

the estate to ,the eldest alone is forbidden by the sasfcras 1059 . 

These lead to the conclusion that equal distribution among all sons 

was believed to be the rule and giving the major portion to the 

eldest son was an exception (and a rare case) even, in the Vedio 

age. The Ait. Br. (19.3) speaks of the right 1060 of Indra to 

primogeniture ( jyaistfiya ) and pre-eminence ( sraisthya ) This 

right of the eldest son to special treatment at the time of partition 

persisted in the times of Manu (IX. 312 ff) and YS] (H. 114) 

also and even in modern times it is recognized to some extent 

in the case of impartible estates and even in ordinary families 

on the ground of custom or from the nature of the grants made 

by the former Governments or the British Government (such as 

Jaghirs and Saranjams). Both Kau*. and Kat. declare that 

customs of countries, castes, villages and groups varying rules of 

partition and inheritance should be enforced by the king 1061 . Dr. 

Jolly (ibid. p. 98) further relies on the fact that the Apastamba- 

dharmasutra mentions no other kind of partition than that 

made by the father. But this is far from conclusive. Apas- 

tamba was a great purist and idealist He ignores several 

matters which.are wellknown to have existed long before his 

time. For example, he takes no notice of the several kinds of 

secondary sons and he does not allow a brahmana to take up a 

weapon even for examining it except when he is murderously 

attacked ( 1. 10. 29 7-8 ), while Manu ( VEX 345-349 ), Gautama 

VII 6 and 25 and others allow a brahmana much greater 

latitude. Therefore Apastamba'B silence cannot lead to thepositive 

conclusion of the absence of any other method of partition. As 

Ster of fact, Gautama (15.19) who is generally regarded 

as^t to ipastamba states that brahmanas that had separated

invited for dinner at a sraddha 1K2 That Bhows that paitition of 
sons from the father against the father's will was wellknown 
long before Gautama. Dr. Jolly also ( ibid p. 90 ) relies on a'n 
anonymous smrti text ( quoted by the- Mit in its introduction 
to Yaj. H 114) which absolutely prohibits the sale of land. 
But this is irrelevant The text could not be taken literally 
when we have seen that sales of land have been taking place 
for at least two thousand years. All that the text means is 
that a sale should be olothed in the form of a gift 1063 .. Similarly 
the few smrti passages that include lands and houses among 
indivisible properties ate to be explained as having in view the 
fragmentation, of a field into small uneconomic plots or holdings 
or the division of a single small house among numerous co- 
sharers. It is impossible to believe that the texts meant that 
houses could never be partitioned among co-heirs. All that we 
can reasonably infer is that as a general rule such partitions 
were looked upon with disfavour by society. One may concede 
that this sentiment continued long after even Gautama and 
Spastamba and even in the 20th century a Hindu son suing 
his father for partition incurs great opprobrium. 

Apart from the inference to be drawn from some of the 
Vedic passages quoted above, it follows that partition did take 
place, though probably rarely, during the father's lifetime and 
even against his will, as indicated by Gautama's dictum. It is 
now to be seen what the smrtis and the medieval writers say 
about the time of partition. One time was when the father 
divided the property among his sons during his lifetime as 
evidenced by the Tai. S. HI. 1 9. 4, Ap Dh. S. II 6. 14. 1, Gaut 
28 3, Baud DhS. H. 2.8, Yaj U. U4, NSr. dayabhaga 4. Another 
time was after the death of the father ( Gaut 38. 1, Manu IX. 104 
Yaj II 117, NSr. dayabhaga 2). The Dayabhaga 10 " admits only 
these two times for partition viz. on the cessation of the father's

ownership (by death or renunciation of. the world as an ascetic 
or because he has lost all desires) and during the father's life- 
time at his own desire. The V. P. (pp. 429 and 434,435) 
strongly criticizes the Dayabhaga as to theBe two. Some 
writers like Jimfitavahana went so far as to hold that even 
though the father be dead ■ there should be no partition among 
the sonB during their mother's life 106s . The Mit (following 
Gaut. 28. 1-2) indicates three principal times for partition, i"* 
viz (1) at the father's desire during his lifetime, (2) when the 
father has lost all desire for worldly goods, desiBtsfrom sexual 
intercourse and the mother is past the age of child-bearing, 
partition may take place at the desire . of the sohb even against 
the wish of the father (Gaut. 28. 2, Nar. dayabhaga3, Br S B 1. 
33 p 369 verse 1); (3) after the death of the father. The Mit 
relying on Sankha's 1067 text adds that even though the mother 
may not be past child-bearing, yet the sons can partition at

their desire, ©Ten against the father's will if the father pursues 
an immoral or irreligious mode of life or is afflicted with, a 
chronic disease or iB very old. NSr. ( dayabhaga 16 ) is similar. 
It should not be supposed that the Mit. holds that there are only 
three times for partition ; according to it there are other times 
also (as in the text of Sankha quoted by it). This is made 
clear by the V. P. p 434. The Dayabhaga reads the text of 
Sankha-Likhita differently and takes it to mean that as long 
as the father is alive there can be no partition against his will 
even if he be very old or suffering from a chronic disease or 
has not all his wits about him, and that in such a contingency 
the eldest son or with his consent the next younger brother 
who is capable may manage the family affairs. The Daya- 
bhaga quotes a similar passage of H&rlta (which is also 
quoted by the Madanaratna, the VyavaharamayBkha and other 
digests). On account of the remarks of _ the Mit. some works 
like the Madanaparijata (pp. 645 ff) speak of four times for 
partition, viz. during the father's lifetime at his choice ( Yaj. It. 
114), even against his will when the mother is past child-bear- 
ing and the father is free from all sexual desires and does not 
care for wealth ( Ear. dayabhaga 3 ), when-the father is old or 
follows the path of arftoma or suffers from au incurable disease 
then even again B t his will (relying ,on Sankha as quoted in the 
Mit.), and after the father's death. The V. Uir. (p, 408) is 
almost of the same view.

with his father (i.e. the grandfather of the grandson) the 
grandson cannot demand a share in the grandfather's wealth 
(since Yaj H. 120 has been explained as meaning that when the 
father is dead then the assignment of shares among grandsons 
is according to the share of the father) Another doubt is — 
even if a partition can be had by the grandsons in these cases 
it will be only if the father so desires To this the Mit replies 
emphatically 10W that in the grandfather's property the owner- 
ship of father and son is wellknown in the world and therefore 
partition (in the above two cases of doubt) does take place. 
The Mit. further on expressly says that even when the mother 
is not past child-bearing and the father still cares for wealth 
and worldly affairs, partition of grandfather's wealth does take 
place at the desire of the son even if the father is unwilling. 
The Mit. makes it clear that the rule of division per stupes is a 
special rule laid down by the texts ( vacantia vyavaslha ) for a 
special case and that in other cases the primary rule of owner- 
ship by birth applies. From Manu IX. 209 the MitaksarH 
further draws the inference that even against the father's wish 
a son can demand partition of property acquired by the grand- 
father. This is the modern Hindu Law in the MitaksarS school 
generally recognised by ther Courts in British India. In Apaji

HI ] Sore's right to partition 571 

Bombay High Court held that a son cannot in the lifetime of his 
father sue his father and uncles f ot a partition of the family 
property and for possession of his share therein, when the father 
does not assent to such a snit, although the son has a right 
by birth in ancestral property. The other High Courts have 
dissented from this view of the majority of the Bombay 
Full Bench and have followed the dissenting judgment of 
Telang J.™ 1 . 

When the son's right of ownership by birth in ancestral 

property came to be recognised by such smitis as that of Yaj„ 

it followed as a logical consequence that any person who 

acquires a right by birth can demand partition and separate 

possession of his share at any time It has been already seen 

that even before Gautama sons separated from their father 

against his will, but this was condemned by the sages and 

obloquy and infamy attached to such conduct. Some of the 

smrtis recognised the son's right to partition even in the father's 

lifetime under great restrictions More than fifteen centuries 

passed (from Gautama to the MitaksaTa) before the son's 

right to separate from his father during the latter's lifetime and 

against his desire was clearly, ungrudgingly and emphatically 

recognized The Vlramitrodaya also clearly recognizes this 

right of the son. But even among writers that generally follow 

the Mit. there were some that could not bring themselves to 

admit this right of the son. Vox example, the Madanaparijata 

(p. 663) asserts that merely at the will of the son there can be 

no partition. Under the Dayabhaga, these questions cannot 

arise, as tbe son has no Tight by birth in ancestral property. ' 

This evolution of the son's right to demand partition even 
during the father's lifetime received, a fillip from certain'reli- 
gious sentiments entertained in ancient times. Gaut { 38 4 ) 
remarks that if, instead of remaining united, brothers separate

This shows that there was an option either to remain joint after the 
father's death or to become separate, Sankba-Likhita say that 
brothers may stay together since being united they will prosper 
( materially ). 1073 Br. provides that in the case of members of a 
joint family that live together and have a common kitchen the 
worship of gods, Manes and brahmanas is single for all, 
while when they become separate such worship will be separately 
carried on in each house. 1074 Nar. ( dayabhaga 37 ) lays down 
that when brothers are undivided the performance of religious 
acts iB single for all of them but when there is a partition, the 
religious acts are separately performed by each Dh'arma 
means here mainly such religious acts as the performance 1WS 
of the five great daily sacrifices ( panca rnahSyajnas ). When 
the family is joint, worship of gods, Vaisvadeva, honouring of 
family guests are only single for the whole family and all 
participate in the spiritual benefits derived from such acts, but 
when the members become separate, each performs these reli- 
gious acts separately. Mami'm 67 lays down that each house- 
holder has to perform with the grhya fire kindled at the time of 
marriage all grhya rites such as morning and evening offerings, 
the five great sacrifices anlTthe daily cooking ' of food. The 
Sangraha seemB to have held that dharma refers to the perfor- 
mance of agmhotra, but the Sni. 0. II p. 259 and V. P. ( 437-438 } 
do not accept this and hold that even when joint any coparcener 
ban perform all srauta and smarta rites like agnihotra with tbe 
help of the undivided joint estate and so dhatma means only the 
worship of gods and Manes and the honouring of guests. Vyasa 
also has a verse similar to Mr. and Br.

ml Partition during ininanhj 573 

Partition was generally made when all the coparceners 
were major, 107 ' but from Kant (HL 5), Baud Dh. S. (n. 3 42) and 
Kat (844-45) it appears that the minority of a coparcener did 
not operate as a bar to partition. Kaut. (IEL 5 ) says 'partition 
takes place when the persons separating have attained majority ; 
but ( the separating coparceners ) should keep in the custody 
of the mother's relatives of those coparceners who are minors 
or of the elders of the village the share of the minors after all 
debts of the family are paid off, till the minor coparceners 
attain majority. The same rule applies to a member ( of a joint 
family) that has gone abroad'. Baud, employs almost the same 
words. Kat. provides " partition is ordained among coparceners 
who have attained (years of) understanding of worldly affairs 
and in the case of males they attain this understanding ai the 
16th year. The property ( share in joint family estate ) of those 
who have not attained years of discretion, being made free from 
expenses (debts etc.), Bhould be kept (by the other major copar- 
ceners) with the relatives or friends of the minor members. 
The same should be done to the share of those who have gone 
abroad. " This shows that partition could take place even when 
some members of the family were minors and even a single 
member could demand at his will a partition of his share as 
expressly stated by the Dayabhaga ( HL 16-1? ), the V P and 
other workers, Thera is a controversy among oommen j ators 
whether minority terminated at the beginning or end of the 

till the 16th year. ITrom a verse ( attributed to Angiras by Mit

[Vol. 



the beginning of the 16th year"® A verse of KM appears to 
hold that minority ends at the beginning of the 16th year, many 
commentators also hold this view, but several such as Haradatta 
( on Gaut X. 48 ), V. E p. 599, V. P p. 263 expressly state that 
minority ends at the end of the 16th year." 81 It may be stated 
that according to Gaut X. 48-49, Manu VHL 27, Vas. 16. 8, 
Visnu Dh. S. m 65 the king was to guard the property of 
minors, women and helpless people In modern times under the 
Indian Majority Act ( Act IX of 1875 ) the age of majority is 18 
( or 21 in certain cases only ) except in matters of marriage, 
dower, divorce and adoption. In these last matters the ancient 
Hindu Law will apply to Hindus 1061 ". Similarly a partition 
could be made even though the wife of a coparcener was 
pregnant It was therefore that Vas. 17. 4L advised postponing 
partition till the delivery of the pregnant wives of coparceners, 
or Yaj. H. 122 and Manu IX. 216 provide for a son born after 
partition between father and sons 

The next question is what property is liable to be partitioned. 
A few preliminary remarks on property must be made here 
Property is generally divided by most smrtis into two kinds, 
sth5va>a( immovable, such as lands and houses) and jmiqama 
( movable) For example, Br. ( S. B E. vol. 33 p 323 verse 17 ) 
andKat (516) speak of both kinds of property as subjects of 
pledges or mortgages. There is another classification in Y5j, 
II. 121 and a few other smrtis viz. property is of three kinds.

may bo divided into two classes, {1} joint family property, (2) 
separate property. Joint family property is either ancestral 
property or property jointly acquired im with or without the 
aid of ancestral property or property acquired separately but 
thrown into the common stock ( Manu IX. 304 ) The Mit on 
Yaj 1 120 states 'among unseparated brothers, if the common 
stock be improved or augmented by one of them through agri- 
culture, trade or similar means, an equal distribution neverthe- 
less takes place and a double share is not allotted to the 
acquirer.' This contains the doctrine of merger of estate by 
blending. Vide Slnlxiprasad v Ptayag Knman'L.'R 59 LA. 331= 
34 Bom. L B. 1567. Ancestral property (apialtbandhadaya) 
is all property inherited by a male from his father, paternal 
grandfather or paternal great-grandfather, in which according 
to the Mit, School, the sons, grandsons and great-grandsons 1081 
of the person who inherits it acquire an interest by bath. Sepa- 
rate property also includes what is called self-acquired property 
( svSrjtta ), which will be discussed a little later on If a person 
obtains a share of ancestral property on partition, it has been 
held that it is his separate property if he has no son, grandson 
or great-grandson, but if there be any of these then it is ancestral 
property in his hands so far as he and any of his male descen- 
dants are concerned. Under the Dayabhaga, as the son does 
not acquire ownership by birth in ancestral property, there is 
hardly any distinction between ancestral property and separate 
property so far as the father's powers of alienation are concerned 
A few of the outstanding features of the Dayabhaga system have 
already been set out above and some m ay he discussed later

m j Kinds of separate property 5r? 

A person while he is a member of a joint Hindu family 
under the Mit and has an interest in joint family property may 
have separate property of his own acquired in various ways. The 
different sources of ownership have been already mentioned 
above (pp. M.7 and 548) The different kinds of separate property 
are mainly these ; (1) property taken as obstraeted heritage, 
that is, property inherited from any person other than the father, 
father's father or father's father's father ( such as a brother, 
uncle etc.) 1085 ; (2) a gift of a small portion of ancestral mov- 
able property made through affection by the father to his issue 
(smrtiquotedbyMit.) 1036 ,(3) gift or bequest of separate pro- 
perty made by the father 1087 to his sons; (4) gifts aud bequests 
made by other relations and friends and gifts at the time of 
marriage ; (5) ancestral property lost to the family and recovered

efforts without assistance from 'joint family property; (6) sepa- 
rate earnings and gains of learning or science ( wdyadhana). A 
few remarks will be made on some of these in the sequel. 

It is a remarkable fact that the smrti texts on separate 
property do not expressly mention gifts received from strangers 
by a member of a 3oint family as the separate property of that 
particular member The only gifts mentioned are those from 
friends, or those received at the time of marriage ( called audva- 
lulai in Ysj. II. 118 and Manu IX 206 ) or at a madhuparka in 

1085 A decision of the P C, from Madras held that properly inhe-

honour of a learned man, a priest etc. It is probable that 
gifts from strangers to a member of the joint family that did not 
fall within the several classes of separate property mentioned 
above belonged to the whole family The concept of the separate 
property of a member of a joint family was of slow growth. 
Originally all property however acquired by any member might 
have been held to belong to the whole family. This is indicated 
to some extent by Manu VIII, 416, which was ( as shown above 
on pp. 555-556) however interpreted by Sahara, Medbatithi, 
the Dayabhaga and others in subsequent times, as meaning that 
the acquirer ( son or wife ) had no independent power of disposal 
though he or she was owner of what was earned by him or her 
It is noticeable that so late a writer as Haradatta 1088 relies on 
this verse of Manu and remarks that while the father is alive 
whatever is earned, by a member, whether learned or not, 
belongs to the father (on Gaut 28 29) The Dayabhaga «*> 
(IL 66-73) quotes a text of Kat. (851) "the father gets two 
shares or half of the wealth acquired by the son" and explains 
it in two ways. If thb son acquires wealth with the help of 
ancestral funds, the father takes half of it, the acquirer gets 
two shares and the other sons one share each, if the son 
acquires wealth without using ancestral funds, the father and 
acquirer take two shares each and the others take nothing Another 
meaning is that if the father is learned he takes half , but if he » 
not so, he takes only two shares. TheV P.(pp ^\\™«fl 
criticizes the Dayabhaga for these remarks The first inroad an 
Z conception that the earnings of all m the &mly belonged to 
the head of the family was made in the times of the bM *

not share with others if he does not desire to do bo, because that 
acquisition was made by his own activity. Manu IX 206 
mentions besides vidyadhana, gifts from friends, gifts at the tmie 
of marriage and at vtadhuparha as the separate property of a 
person Yaj. (H. 118-119 ) prescribes : 'whatever is acquired by a 
person himself without detriment to or expenditure of paternal 
wealth, gifts from friends, gifts at marriage, these are not 
liable to be divided among a man's coparceners ; similarly he 
who recovers ancestral property lost to the family (and not 
recovered by the father and others) would not have to share it 
at a partition with his coparceners nor his gains of learning*. 
The construction to be put on these words was a bone of 
contention even before Visvarupa. The Mit. understands that 
the words ' whatever is acquired without detriment to the 
paternal wealth ' are to be understood as qualifying each of 
the following four kinds of property. 1091 The result is that if a 
gift is acquired by a member from a grateful person who was 
placed under obligation by spending family wealth, if property 
was acquired by gift from a father-in-law who was paid from the 
family property some wealth for securing the bride for that 
member ( as in an asura marriage } ot if the property lost to the 
family was recovered with the help of paternal estate or if a 
man learnt at the expense of the family and made gains from 
that learning, then these kinds of properties were liable to be 
partitioned among all members. The result of taking the first 
half of Ygj 31 118 as a qualification of the subsequent four 
kinds of property ( as done by the Mit ) is that if a man receives 
a gift from a stranger even without detriment to the paternal 
estate the gift was liable to be divided among all members. 
The reason of the Mit is that, if the first half of Yaj U. 118 is 
not a qualifying clause of the four kinds of property, then the 
following four kindB need not be expressly mentioned at 
all. If whatever is acquired by a member himself without

detriment to paternal or joint estate is by itself separate property 
then the following four will only be particular illustrations of 
the proposition contained in the first half of Taj JI 118 
It would be opposed to the usage of sistas to say that gifts from 
friends or gift? at the time of marriage or gains of learning 
acquired at the expense of the family estate become the separate 
property of a person and, as to ctdiJadMm acquired from learn- 
ing at the expense of the family, opposed to the express text of 
Nat. ( dayabhaga 10) " when one brother maintains the family of 
another brother who is engaged in studying the sastras, he shall 
receive a share of the wealth gained by that study, though he 
(the supporting brother) be ignorant himself ". Further, if the first 
half of Yaj H. 118 were taken as a separate and independent 
clause by itself then it would follow that what is acquired by 
ftialigialia ( as a gift to a learned biahmana ) without detriment 
to the paternal estate would be indivisible but the usage of the 
itsias is the opposite of this That there was such a usage 
about prattgraha is admitted by the Diyabhaga ( VI. 1 54 p 121) 
It must be stated however that this view of the Mit, about the 
first half of Taj II 118 is not shared by several writers and 
works such as the Dayabhaga VI 1. 8 p. 106, Dipakaliks, 
Visvarupa, T.Ep 501, AparSrka p. 723. 

As regards family property lost to the family by the 
adverse acts of a stranger but recovered by a member with his 
own efforts without using ancestral estate, certain Prions 
deserve notice Manu IX. 209 (-Visnu Dh S. 18 43), Br 
(S B E 33 p 371 verse IS) and Kat «» (866) lay down the 
special rule that if the father recovers property losttothe 
fS whether movable or immovable, with his o*n effort 
wSo^uJng joint family funds he may J^j£££*

not the father } is land, then the recoverer gets one fourth of it 
as Wb reward ( according to Sankha ) 1093 and the remainder is 
divided equally among all members of the family including 
the recoverer. TheBe Tules have been followed in modern times 
by the British Indian Courts 109 *. 

Vulyudltana (gains of learning) has undergone the greatest 
changes of fortune since the earliest times to modem days. 
It was probably the first kind of self-acquisition recognised in 
very early times Though the Ap. Dh S and Baud. Dh S. say 
nothing about it, yet Gaut 10,4 « ( 28. 38-29 ) lays down that all 
members ( of a joint family ), if not learned, should divide 
equally whatever is earned by them ( by agriculture etc. ) but 
what a learned man himself acquires by his learning he may 
not share with his unlearned brothers if he so desires. Hara- 
datta says that this applies only between brothers that are joint. 
Vasistha 17. 51 appears 10 * 5 to give two shares to the acquirer of 
wealth at a partition among brothers and his rule probably 
represents a very early stage when the acquirer could not retain 
the whole of his self-acquisition but got only two shares

in ifc and the rest of the joint family memberB took one share 
each in it. Manu IX. 206, Yaj. II. 119, Nar ( dayabhaga 11). 
Kat 1096 ( 868 ) and Vyasa say ' generally that mdyadliana is not 
liable to be divided at a partition. Among writers of smrtis Kat 
contains the most elaborate treatment of vidyadhana and of self- 
acquisitions in general. It will be set out in the sequel. But 
some of the smrtis point out that even vidyadhana is partible, 
if learning was acquired at the expense of the family funds (as in 
Nar dayabhaga 10 referred to above ) or when the learning was 
acquired in the family house itself from the father or an elder 
brother (Kat 1097 874). The Dayabhaga (VI 1 42-49) dis- 
cusses at great length the views of Srfkara on Ya] II. 118 and 
Manu IX. 208 and dissents from them and states his conclusion 
as follows- A. man since his birth depends upon his family 
for food and maintenance and so if the words "without expen- 
ding ancestral estate " were literally and widely interpreted, 
hardly any man can say that no paternal wealth was expended 
on him and so earnings of whatever kind would have to be 
deemed to be partible and there would be no propriety or purpose 
zn the words of Manu IX. 208. Therefore it must be under- 
stood as done by Visvarupa that the detriment meant is not the 
expenditure of food in maintaining a person in the house from 
infancy, but that when a member acquires estate by his learn- 
ing or in any other way without giving or spending paternal 
wealth for acquiring that, 'then only it becomes his self- 
acquisition 1 " 8 .

!U] Definition of VrdjjadJiana 583 

Kat. (867-873) defines 1099 and illustrates vidyadhana as" 

follows : — _ 

That wealth is Baid to be the gains of ddya which ra 
acquired by means of learning received from another while 
subsisting on food furnished by others, when a matter ( a doubt 
or difficult point) has been placed (before an assembly of 
learned men ) with a wager, whatever is gained by ( the display 
of) one's learning is known as iidyadhana, which is not divided 
at a partition. What is acquired from a pupil ( i . e. by following 
the profession of teaching ), by performing the work of a priest 
at a sacrifice, by propounding a question, by solving a doubtful 
point, by exhibiting one's knowledge, by disputation with a 
rival, what is gained by deep learning-all these are declared to 
be ttdyadhana, which is not divided at a partition. The same 
is the rule in the case of artisans and as to whatever is obtained 
( as a reward ) over and above the proper price of an article 
(which surplus becomes the self-acquisition of the member 
selling it ) After vanquishing a rival in a wager whatever is 
obtained by ( superior ) knowledge should be known as vidya- 
dhana and it is not liable to be partitioned. This is the view 
of Brhaspati. What is earned by an assertion of one's learn- 
ing, what is obtained from a pupil ( i e. by teaching > and what 
is acquired on the analogy of priests officiating at a sacrifice- 
all these are known as vidyadhana, according to Bhrgu. What 
is obtained by the superiority of one's learning and from a 
sacrificer and from a pupil-all this is declared to be vidya- 
dhana ; acquisitions other than these are common ( i. e. jointly 
owned) with others. 

Kat distinguishes between saw uadlian.7. (reward given by 
the king or a master when pleased with a soldier or servant

who putting his life in danger did an act of valour) and 
dhutjahrta (what is recovered in a battle after putting one's 
life in danger of death and after putting to flight the army of 
the adversary ) N&r ( dayabhaga 6 ) and Br (S B E vol. 
33 p. 381 verse 78 ) appear to put both under saiuyadham. Kat 
divides the bhuryadliana of Nar and Br into two, viz 
hanyar/ata ( what is obtained at the time of marriage with a 
maiden of the same caste) and lanahha ( wealth that comes 
with one's wife ) So it is the same as the imiahia ( of Manu 
IX 206 ) and the audialnka (of Yaj H 118). Vyasa mentions 1100 
a limitation that even wealth acquired by valour does not be- 
come the exclusive property of the acquirer if he used a horse 
and weapons belonging to the joint family; in such a case the 
acquirer gets two shares and the other members of the family 
one share each 

In modern times vidyadhana has been a fruitful source of 
litigation The first verse of Kat quoted above has been cited 
in several cases such as Dm ga Dal v. Ganesh DatZZ M. 305 
at p 312, where it is said that Katyayana's definition of vidya- 
dhana is not exhaustive, but only illustrative ( the same is the 
view of the Dayabhaga ) 

The leading cases that discuss the texts and lay dowD 
propositions are noted below 1!ot . 

Two propositions were well established by the cases, viz 
(1) that money earned by a member of a joint Hindu family by 
the practice of a profession requiring special training was joint 
family property, provided such training was imparted attHe 
expense of joint family property; {%) that gains made by per- 
sonal labour and without the use or help of joint family funds 
by a member of a joint Hindu family, who was maintained out 
of joint family funds and received no more than an elementary 
or ordinary education suitable to his position as a member of

HI 1 - Gains of Learning Act 585 

Gains of Learning Act (Act XXX of 1930) which provides 
that, notwithstanding any ouBtom, rule or interpretation of 
Hindu Law, no gains of learning ( i. e. education whether ele- 
mentary, technical, scientific, special or general and training 
of every kind which enables a person to pursue any trade, in- 
dustry ox avocation ), whether made before or after the com- 
mencement of the Act, shall he held not to he the exclusive and 
separate property of the aoquirer merely by reason of his learning 
having been wholly or in part imparted to him by any member, 
living or deceased, of his family or with the aid of the funds of 
the joint family or of any member thereof or by reason of 
himself or his family having, while he was acquiring his learn- 
ing, been supported wholly or in part by the joint funds of the 
family or the funds of any member thereof. This Act is thus 
retrospective 

All property of a joint family other than the separate 
property of individual members is liable to partition, i. e as 
stated by Kst., property of the grandfather, of the father and 
whatever is acquired by each member (by the use of joint 
funds 1 "* is so liable). Separate property is said to be impartible 
( ambhnjya ) on account of the source from which or the manner 
in which it is acquired. But there are certain kinds of property 
which from their very nature are not allowed to be partitioned 
and have to be enjoyed in common or by turns.

may take it away ". Another explanation is that the prohibition 
refers to a rite or dwelling for religious purposes and to a field 
that is meant for grazing cows. The third explanation is that 
the prohibition implies that when the house or field is of small 
value it should not he partitioned by metes and bounds, but 
there should be partitioning of the price only. The DayabhSga 
gives yet another explanation ( VL %. 30 p. 138) that if during 
the father's lifetime any of the sons builds a house or lays out a 
garden on a family site, then it should not be divided at a 
partition but assigned to him only. 

The basic verse on things impartible from their very 
nature is Manu IX.219" 07 ( =Visnn Dh. S. 18. 44) which 
says " clothes, vehicles, ornaments, cooked food, water (well 
etc ), women, yogaltsema and ways — these are declared to be 
impartible". All commentators explain that clothes ordinarily 
worn by the several members are impartible; provided they are 
more or less equal in value but not costly ones nor new ones. 
The same remark applies to vehicles and ornaments. Pracaia 
means either " wayB leading to the house, garden and the like " 
( Mit , Apararka, and V. P. ) and also ' ways and pasture lands 
for cows and the like ' ( Sm. C. H. p. 377, Kulluka ). The 
Mifc. ( on Yaj U. 118-119 ) states a special rule from Br. that 1108 
the clothes and ornaments worn by the father, the bed and the 
vehicle used by him should on his death be donated to the

be partitioned by valuing it.' 109 If there be a single female 
slave ( not a concubine } she was to be made to work for the 
divided members by turns, but if there be several slaves they 
could be assigned to each or their price could be divided. The 
expression " yogdksema " has been variously explained from very 
ancient times. Laugaksi ( quoted by the Mit. ) states " those 
who know the truth say that ' yoga ' means ' sacrifices ' and 
ksema means purta ( i. e. works of charity like wells }. They 
both ( i. e the money set apart for these or the merit derived 
from theBe ) are impartible, as are also the bed and the ( wooden ) 
seat (used by the father or other member ). " From this verse the 
Mit. concludes that yogdksema means sacrificial acts performed 
with srauta or smarta fire and charitable gifts such as construct- 
ing a tank or park etc. For ista and purta vide H of Dh. vol. II 
pp. 147, 843-844 and pp. 914-915 n. 3112 for the Mit. on yogaksema. 
The words " yoga " and " ksema " occur even in the Bgveda 
VH. 86. 8, X. 89 10, X. 166. 5 and in Tai Br HI. 9. 19. 3 and 
Ait. Br. 37. 2. Even though joint family funds are spent for these 
still they are impartible. The Mit. further states that according 
to some yogaksema means 1110 "royal ministers and purohita" 
who bring about the welfare of people, while others hold that 
the word means "umbrella, chowne, weapons, shoes, and the 
like ". From Gaut IX. 63 and XL 16 it appears that yogalesema 
came to mean even before Gautama's time " comfortable life " 
or "easy and happy way of maintenance" (particularly for 
a learned brahmana). The V. B . p 504 tells 11 " us that,

according to Frakasa, yogaksema means " maintenance or 
annuity descending from the father (to the eon) at a royal 
•palace " and that Halayndha explained yoga as meaning a ship 
or the like and ksema as fort. The Sm. C. II p. 277 after quot- 
ing Laugaksi gives an alternative explanation that yogaksema 
means the wealth gained by a learned brahmana resorting to a 
rich man for his maintenance. 1112 

Kant. ( III. 5 ) states 1113 the view, of the aoaryas that those 
who are poor may divide even their water vessels and Kaut. 
adds that this dictum is fallacious or contradictory. Kat. 
( 882-884 ) brings together several things that are impartible 111 * 
" money that is entered in a document and is set apart for a 
religious purpose, water, women, a tvibandha ( periodic gain ) that 
descends hereditarily, clothes worn ( on the body every day ), 
ornaments, whatever else that is not fit to be divided— these 
should be so employed by co-sharers that they may be enjoyed 
( in common by -all) at the proper time. A. pasture for cattle, 
ways, dothes worn on the body ( every day ), money lent and 
what is set apart for religious purposes— these should not be 
divided This is the view of BrhaBpati." 

Brhaspati ( S B. E. 33 p. 382 verses 79-84 ) has a good deal 
to say about things impartible. He finds fault with Mami IX

and the like are impartible. He says ms " those who declared 
that clothes and the like are impartible have not given proper 
thought. In the case of the rich, their wealth may consist of 
( valuable ) clothes and ornaments. If these ( clothes and orna- 
ments ) be kept joint ( i. e undivided ) they cannot yield subsis- 
tence nor can they be assigned to one alone ( out of many 
co-sharers) They should therefore be distributed with skill, 
otherwise they will become useless Clothes and ornaments moy 
be divided by selling them ( i. e. by dividing the proceeds of 
sale ), debt consigned to writing is divided after recovering it 
( i. e. the bond itself is not divided ), cooked food ( may be divid- 
ed) by exchanging it for uncooked food. The waters of wells 
that have flights of steps and of other wells is to be enjoyed by 
drawing it out according to the needs ( of the co-sharers ); m tho 
same way a field or a water course is to be enjoyed according to 
respective shares ; a single female slave is to be made to work 
in the houses of the co-sharers according to their Bhares; if thoro 
be several female slaves, they are to be allotted in equal shares 
( to the sharers ); this very rule applies to male slaves also; the 
income derived from a yogaksema grant is to bo equally divid- 
ed and pasture lands ( or ways ) are to be used by tho co-Bharcre 
according to their respective shares. " 

The next points to be dealt with are what persons are entitl- 
ed to partition and what is the modo of partition But boforo 
doing so some preliminary remarks must be made on tho express- 
ions coparcenary and 'joint family \ which occur at every stop in 
modern works on Hindu Law. In the smrtis and commentaries 
we come across the words hrtmnba (Nflr., dattaprad&nika 6 or 
Y&j H 175 ), or atMahta-hitumba ( Yaj. II. 45 ). A joint Hindu 
family consists of all males lineally descended from « .common

A coparcenary is purely a creation of law ;- it cannot be 
created by act of parties, except by adoption In order to be 
able to claim a partition, it does not matter how remote from 
the common ancestor a person may be, provided he is not more 
than four degrees removed from the last male owner who has 
himself taken an interest by birth."" 

Some characteristic features of the Mitaksara coparcenary 
may be briefly stated. There is in the first place unity of 
oamership i. e. the whole body of coparceners is the owner and 
no individual member can say, while the family is undivided, 
that he has a definite share, as his interest is always fluctuating, 
being liable to be enlarged by deaths and diminished by births 
in the family. There is also unity of possession and enjoyment 
i. e all are entitled to possession and enjoyment of the family

then he forms a coparcenary with B, X>, F. Suppose that B dies before A, 
That will not however introduce X into the coparcenary of which A is the 
head, as X being the son ot A's great-grandson F takes no interest by birth 
in ancestral property held by A. Suppose that B C D E F and G all die in 
the lifetime of A, then A becomes the sole surviving coparcener and X is not 
a coparcener along with A, because be is Sth in descent (counting both A 
and X] from A. Suppose A the only surviving coparcener dies ThenX 
will take A's property as an heir and not by survivorship as a coparcener,

behalf of all Surther, while the famHy is iT^T "om 
coparceners have many children and others have few or none or 
some are absent, they cannot complain at the time of partition 
about some coparceners having exhausted the whole income and 
cannot ask fos an account of past income and expenditure Kat. 
(88S) expressly states so w, « Moreover, the joint family 
property devolves by survivorship i e on the death of a 
coparcener his interest lapses and goes to the other coparcener*, 
subject to this that if the deceased has left a son, grandson, or 
great-grandson, the latter represents and occupies the place of 
the deceased coparcener when a partition takes place A female 
cannot be a coparcener ( even if she be the wife or the mother ) 
Another characteristic is that each coparcener has a right to 
enforce a partition. The affairs of the family are managed by the 
father and if he be very old or dead, by the senior brother or 
member or by any other member with the consent of the senior 
member (JN&r., dayabhaga 5 and Sankha quoted above in note 1067). 
The manager is called IccaiS ta modern times though the smrtis 
and digests employ words like kiittmbtn (Taj 2145), grlrnt, 
qrtopati, prdbhu (K&t 543) and not hat 13. He has special 
powers of disposition ( by mortgage, sale or gift ) of family 
property in a season of distress (for debts), for the purposes and 
benefit of the family ( maintenance, education and marriages of 
members and other dependents ) and particularly for religious 
purposes ( sraddhas and the like ), ,IM The father has the same

coparcener can only separate himself from the family. The 

father can make within reasonable limits gifts of ancestral 

movable property without"" the consent of bis sons for 

performing indispensable acts of duly and for purposes laid 

down by the texts, such as gifts through affection (to wife, 

daughter, son or the like), the support of the family and relief 

from distress. The father can make a gift of even immovable 

property within 1 " 2 reasonable limits for pious purposes only 

( such as to a family idol or to an idol in a temple at the time of 

obsequies). The father can sell or mortgage the joint family 

property to pay off an antecedent debt contracted by him foT his 

own personal benefit, provided it is not illegal or immoral { vide 

p. 448 above ). No coparcener ( except the father or manager 

as stated above ) can dispose of his undivided interest by gift» 

sale or mortgage according to the strict theory of the Mitaksara 

e^-ept with the consent of the other coparceners. This right to 

objec \ to alienations made ' without consent or made without 

legal necessity is another characteristic of the joint Hindu family 

under the Mitaksara. Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 384 verae 93 ) says* 123 

" whether kinsmen are joint or separate they aTe alike as Tegards

a coparcener may sell, mortgage or alienate for value his 
undivided interest in coparcenary property without the consent 
of the other coparceners 1124 and the courts have allowed the 
undivided interest of a coparcener in joint family property to 
be attached at the instance of a creditor for the individual 
debts of a coparcener. This is one of the most serious 
departures from ancient and medieval Hindu Law made by the 
Courts on the ground of equity. One more right of all members 
of the joint Hindu family is the right to be maintained from 
the property and income of the joint family Such matters as 
the remedies of the purchaser or mortgagee fiom an individual 
coparoener are here left out of consideration as appropriate only 
in a treatise on modern Hindu Law. 

The conception of a coparcenary under the Dayabhaga 
system is entirely different from that of the Mitaksara. Under 
the DayabhSga, sons do not acquire any interest by birth m 
ancestral property, but the son's rights arise for the first time 
on the- father's death and the Bons take as heirs and not by 
survivorship There is hence no coparcenary in the sense of the 
Mitaksara between a father and his sons The father has 
absolute power to dispose of all kinds of ancestral property by 
sale, mortgage, gift, will or otherwise in the same way as he can 
dispose of his separate property. The son has no right to demand 
a partition during his father's lifetime. A coparcenary .starts 
on the death of , the father between the latter's sons or grandsons 
i. e. between brothers, uncles and nephews, or between cousinB. 
If a coparcener dies without male issue, there is no right of 
survivorship in the other coparceners but the deceased members 
widow or daughter may succeed to his share and thus even 
females may become members of a coparcenary under the Paya- 
bhaga. Each coparcener takes a defined share under the Daya 
bha E a (not an indefinite one as under the Mitaksara) Any 
coheir under the DayabMga can sell mortgage, ^or dispo B e 
off by gift or will his sha re ( Dayabhaga II Z8-J1 )

HI] Rights of posllaimous soli 595 

Every coparcener is entitled to a share on partition. It has 
been already stated ( on pp. 570-571 } how in Bombay a son is not 
entitled to a partition if the father is joint with his own father, 
brothers or other coparceners and does not assent to the son's claim. 
There is a volume of case-law about a suit for partition brought 
on behalf of a minor, hut it has to be passed over heTe, as there is 
hardly anything corresponding to this in the works on dharma- 
sgstra. The texts provide for the case of a son who was in the 
mother's womb at the time of partition but was horn after it. 
If A and his sons B and 0, who are members of a joint family, 
come to a partition and take one third each of the family 
property and six months later A's wife gives birth to a son D, 
then the partition has to be reopened and D will get J ( i if the 
mother is given a share) of the family property that will remain 
after meeting all proper charges since the first partition and 
taking into account all income' and accretions during the 
interval. The same rule applies to a partition among brothers 
when the widow of a predeceased brother gives birth to a 
posthumous son conceived before the partition hut born after it

get a share out of the property (not as it stood at the date of 
partition ) that would be there after allowing for proper expendi- 
ture (e.g. payment of debts etc.) and accretions. The Mit. 
extends the same rule to a posthumous son born after partition 
to the widow of a brother who died before the partition and 



1129. In Nateal Stitgh v. Bhagman Stngh 4 All. 427, where after 
the father separated from his three sons he married a second wife, had a son 
from her and died leaving certain property inherited by Mm from a third 
person, it was held, relying on Manu, the Mit . Br. and the Viramitrodaya, 
that the son born after partition was entitled to the whole of the property 
acquired by the father to the exclusion of the three sons that had separated 
from htm Id Chetlgama t». Muntsamt 20 Mad 75 (where a father partitioned 
His ancestral property half and half between his two sons, reserved no share 
for himself and subsequently another son was born to him) it was held that 
the subsequently born son was entitled to one-third by partition not only in 
the property as it stood at the date of partition, bat also in the property 
acquired by the two sons by means of the produce of that property (relying 
on the words of Yaj. II 122 "ayavyayavt'sodhtlat") The dates of the 
partition and of the birth of the son are not clear from the report. In 
Ganpat v. Gopalrao 23 Bom 636 (where in 1875 a father separated his 
son born of his first wife by giving him one third of the estate and gave two 
thirds to his two minor sons from the second wife and lived with them and 
another son was born to him in 1880, who sued m 1894 claiming one-fourth 
of all property) it was held that the one third given to the son by the first wife 
could not be affected and the plaintiff was only entitled to claim a share in 
the property given to the other two sons, and fuither that the texts of Visnu 
and Yajfiavallya are somewhat vague and are applicable only to the ease of 
posthumous sons who have no provision made for them. Vide also Shivaji- 
too v. Vasantrao 33 Bom 267 for further limitations on this rule in favour 
of the after-born son.

when the fact of the pregnancy was not known to the seating 
Others. Visvarupa regards the whole verse as laying down 
one proposition, the first half declaring that if a son ( who had 
heenTeady conceived) were horn to the father after partition 
with the sons, he would he entitled to the share taken by the 
father, while the and half declares that if the father took no 
share then the son so horn would he entitled to reopen the partit- 
ion and take a share of the property remaining after taking into 
account accretions and expenses. The Dipakalika seems to he 
of the same opinion as Visvarupa, hut it adds that Manu IX. 316 
provides for the case where the son is hoth conceived and horn 
after partition The Sm. C. { D. pp. 306-307 ) holds that when 
in the father's lifetime partition takes place the sons separating 
should give a share to the after-horn son, hut the father should 
retain his, while the whole of Yaj. IL 122 applies to the case 
where partition is made after the father's death and a posthum- 
ous son is born to the mother or to the widow of a brother 
dying before partition. In such a case the partition, should he 
reopened and a share given out of the property as it stood at 
the first partition or out of the property as found to exist at the 
reopened partition after allowing for accretions and proper 
expenses { for payment of debts, for samskSras of brothers and 
sisters ) ; vide V. P. p. 463 for explanation of ' drsyad ' etc. 
The Vyavahara-mayukha (p. 105) follows the Sm. O. and

ring to the case of a posthumous son conceived before partition 
made on the father's death hut bom after partition from the 
mother or step-mother of the separating brothers or from the 
wife of a brother dying before partition. 

An adopted son, if adopted by a coparcener in a joint 
family or by a sole surviving coparcener, becomes under the 
MitaksarS law a member of the coparcenary from the moment 
of his adoption and has the same rights to demand a partition 
as an aurasa son has. Under the Dayabhaga even an aurasa 
son cannot claim partition during his father's life and so an 
adopted son would he in no better position. If after a person 
adopts he has an aurasa son, the adopted son's share becomes 
reduced according to most commentators, but this subject will 
he dealt with later on under adoption. 

The smrtis and some of the medieval and later digests ever

one for the son of the sudra class wife Manu IX. 154 
( almost the same as AnusSsana 47 21 ) further provides 
that whether a brahmana leaves sons or no sons born ( of wives 
of the three twice-born classes ) the heir shall give, according 
to the law, to the son of a sudra class wife no more than a 
tenth part of his estate. V. P. p. 487 and the Mit ( on Yaj. H- 
133) after quoting Manu, make this quite clear. But as remarked 
by the Mit on Yfij U. 125 the son of a brahmana from a wife 
of the ksatriya or other lower class was not to share in land 
obtained by the brahmana by way of gift (vide Br. quoted in 
note 1106 above) though he could share land acquired by 
purchase or the like. A verse (attributed to Br. by D5y IX 22 
and V. R. p. 534 and to Devala by V. P. p. 46G) denieB altogether 
a share in land to a sudra class wife's son of a brfihmana, while 
Manu IX. 155 ( the son of a person of the three higher classes 
from a sudra woman gets no share in the paternal wealth ) is 
variously explained, the Mit saying that it applies only where 
the son has already got some property from his father wMe 
the Mayukha and some others say that it applies to toe son of 
a sudra woman who is not married to the person of higher

downwards quote certain 1131 verses from Saunaka on matters 
forbidden in the Kali age (katviaTjya.) one of which is the 
acceptance of sons other than aurasa and dattaka. ,132

An illegitimate son has in certain circumstances rights of 
partition in the property of his putative father. An illegitimate 
son may be a son by a concubine who is a ddsT (i e. who is in 
exclusive and continuous keeping) or he may be the son of a 
woman who is not a dasi. The first is called daslput)a V3i and 
the second is hardly ever dealt with in dharrnasastra works ,1M

Gujerat where the Vyavaharamayukha is of paramount authority In both 
cases not a word ts said about the proof of the usage of marriages between a 
brahniana and a s'udra woman taking place in Gujerat but reliance is placed 
solely on the recognition of annloma marriages by Mann and Yajnavalkya, 
the strong condemnation of pratiloma marriages by both and the inference 
drawn from the comment of Vijfianesvara and the remarks of Nuakantba 
that anuloma marriages are not prohibited With the most profound respect 
for the learned Judges who decided those two cases, it has to be said that 
tliey took up the position of legislators and did not merely interpret the 
Hindu Law in accordance with usage and ignored the text of the Mayiikba 
itself stating that all secondary Sons (among which the son of a bribmana 
from a s'udra caste wife is included by Mann) except aurasa son (who is 
defined by Yaj 11.128 himself and the Mit. as the sonofatw/e °/ »»

Irom ancient times it had been settled that the daeipatra of a 
person belonging to the twice-born classes is not entitled Jo a 
share on partition or to inherit, but is entitled to maintenance 
only Gaut 38 37 provides 1 "* that even the son of a brahmana 
who is issueless from a sudra woman (a concubine) should 
^receive the means of maintenance provided he is obedient m 
the manner of a pupil Br. ( S B. E. vol. 33 p. 374 verse 31 ) 
contains a similar rule for the maintenance of an illegitimate 
son born of a sudra woman after the father's death. But as 
regards the son of a sudra from a dasl Manu IX 179 provides 
that such an illegitimate son may take a share in the father's 
property if the father allows him to do so. The olassical 
passage on the rights of the illegitimate son of a sudra from a 
dasl is Yaj n.133-134 which verses are introduced by the V. 
Mayukha 1136 with the words "Yaj declares a Bpecial rule as 
regards one begotten by a sudra on a woman ( of the same 
caste) not married to him" and which may be rendered thus 
"even a son begotten by a Sudra on a dasl may partake of a 
share at the choice ( of his father ). But, when the father is- 
dead, the brothers should make him the recipient of a half 
share ". This passage and the comments of the Mit., the V. 
Mayukha, the Dayahhaga have been cited and explained in 
numerous cases The following propositions as deduced from 
the texts and the ease-law may be set out here : — (1) the illegi- 
timate son of a sudra even under the Mit. does not acquire by 
birth any interest in the estate held by the father and so cannot 
enforce a partition in his father's lifetime, hut the father may 
give him a share in his lifetime, which may even be equal to 
that of a legitimate son ( 4 Bom. 37, 44-45, 23 Mad 16 ); (2) on 
the father's death an illegitimate son of a deceased sudra

1137. The decisions establish that dast is not to be taken in the strict 
literal sense (a female slave), but means a woman kept as a concubine, tho 
connection being continuous, exclusive and lawful. In order that the illegi- 
timate son of a sudra may take a share or inherit, it must be shown that 
the connection between the sudra man and the woman was not incestuous 
or adulterous or though adulterous at the beginning had ceased to be so 
when the illegitimate son was born Vide Ralit v Govmd 1 Bom. 97 at

of an adulterous intercourse has been held entitled to maintenance ( 1 Mad

(as in 1 Cat. 1, 19 Cal 91, 28 Cal. 194}, held that dasi meant only a female 
slave and as slavery was abolished in India, there could be no dastputra 
strictly so called. Bnt in Rajamnath v. Nttm 48 Cal 643 (F. B ) the 
former Calcutta decisions were overruled and the Bombay High Court's 
interpretation of dasiputra has been accepted. The passage of the Daya-

Sough he is entitled to maintenance as a member o ^etoly 
provided the father left no separate estate (L. R. 58 L A. Wt). 
It has been held that if a sudra keeps a woman of the brahmana 
caste as his exclusive mistress and has a son from her, he ? s not 
a dasiputra (but ace. ancient works a candala) and is not 
entitled to inherit the estate the sudra father as an Ulegi- 
timate son Vide Ramcliandra v. Hanamnmk 37 Bom L. R. 920 
followed in 18 Lucknow 585. Further rules about the inheri- 
tance of the illegitimate son when in competition with the 
widow, legitimate daughter or legitimate daughter's son will 
be dealt with later on (vide n. 1356 below). 

An absent coparcener stood on the same footing as a minor 
( vide note 1077 above); in modern times he would be subject 
to the law of Limitation (Articles 127 and 144 of the Indian 
Limitation Act of 1908) 

The wife cannot herself demand a partition, but if the hus- 
band himself separates his sons during his lifetime or if the 
sons claim a partition during the father's lifetime, the wife was 
entitled to a share equal to that of a son, according to Yaj 3X 
115. If there be several wives each gets a share equal to that 
of a son. There is a proviso that the wife or wives must not 
be in possession of sh Idliana property given by the husband or 
by the father-in-law and that if there is strldhana, then only as 
much more will be allotted to her as will make her share equal 
to that of a son ( as stated in YaJ EL 148 ). The Mit. on Ya]. II. 
52 states that at the husband's will the wife also gets a share 
of the family wealth but not by her own will 1139 . The Madana- 
ratna explains that the meaning 1140 is simply this that the

father when separating from the sons should take for each of 
his wives a share equal to that of each son, but it is not meant 
that the husband is to carve out separate portions of the joint 
property and hand them over to his wives, since such a proce- 
dure would be opposed to the dictum "there is no partition 
between husband and wife". The V P (pp 441-42) after 
quoting this view of the Madanaratna refutes it by saying that 
Ya] is not here speaking of the partition between husband and 
wife but between the father and sons and that the husband 
assigns to the wife a share as he may give a gift of affection to 
his wife It deserves to be noted that the ancient commentator 
Visvarapa ( on Ya] II 119 of Tri edition ) anticipates modern 
legislation as he states that the widows of pre-deceased sons 
and grandsons also should be given the shares that would have 
been taken by their husbands if living along with his own 
wives by the father at the time of partition with his sons 
Recently by the Hindu Women'a Bights to Property Act (Act 
XVIII of 1937 as amended by Act XI of 1938), it is provided 
that when after the Act comes into force a Hindu governed by 
the Dayabhaga School dies intestate or where a Hindu governed 
by any other school dies living separate property, his widow 
will be entitled to the same share as that of a son and the 
widow of a pre-deceased son or grandson shall inherit in the 
same manner as a son or grandson and further where a Hindu 
governed by any school other than the Dayabhaga dies having 
an interest in joint family property his widow will succeed to a 
Hindu widow's estate as regards the interest he himself had 
This last provision brings the law of the Mitaksaia into line 
with that of the Dayabhaga and makes the widow of a deceased 
coparcener a member of the coparcenary and at one stroke 
does away with the fundamental doctrine of the Mit about

compel a partition so long as the son* choose to remain joint 
But her share is liable to be reduced on account of her possession 
of strldhana as in the case of the wife Vide Y*j H. 123 Visnu 
Dh. S. 18.34 and Ear. ( dayabhaga, 12 ) The Mit. (onYaj 
II 135) combats the view of some predecessors that the mother 
does not take a share but only as much wealth as would be 
necessary foi her maintenance, by relying on the words " equal 
share" occurring in Yaj , Visnu, and Nar which would be 
meaningless on that view It alBO refutes another view that 
the mother takes an equal share with the sons when the ances- 
tral property is small, while she takes only as much as would 
be necessary for her maintenance when the property is large, by 
stating that this view is liable to the fault of mdhwaiiupya 
according to the conclusion established in the Purvaralmamsa, 
that is, here the same sentence will be interpreted as laying 
down two different propositions in different sets of circum- 
stances, which is not a legitimate or reasonable way of inter- 
pretation . The Sm C ( II p 268 ) held the same view about

view that no woman (whether wife or mother) should get a 
share of the ancestral wealth hut only as much wealth aa la 
necessary for maintenance and rely on the words of Baudhs- 
yana " there is a Vedio text that women are devoid of strength 
and take no share ", which refers to a passage in the Tai S. VI 
5 8 2, occurring in the context of the ritual of the Soma sacri- 
fice "therefore women being destitute of strength take no 
portion (of Soma drink) and speak more weakly than even a 
wretched (low) man". Manu IX 18 also contains an echo of 
this passage of the Tai S and of Baud Dh. S. There was an 
intermediate stage m the evolution of the rights of the wife or 
mother. The highest she could get in the husband's wealth 
was two thousand panas, according to Vyasa, 1143 which ia 
variously read and explained, the Sm. 0.(11 p 281) saying 
that it means as much wealth as would every year yield an 
income of 2000 panas 

In modern times some High Courts such as those at 
Bombay" 1 * and Calcutta allow wives and mothers to have a 
share when the husband or the sons divide ancestral estate by 
metes and hounds, while in Southern India the practice of 
allotting shares to them has gone out of vogue long since ana 
the Madras High Court does not allow a share to the i mother 
but only maintenance The DSyabhSga seems to have s hew 
that a step-mother who was herself sonless was not entitled to 
a snare when her step-sons came to a partition, hut was only 
entitled to maintenance (vide Snmali Hemangm v. Kedarnalh

If a person had several wives and several sons from each 
wife, some of the texts prescribed from very ancient times that 
the sons should divide according to the wives or mothers ( i e. 
palnibMga, or which is practically the same thing, matrbhaga 
was recommended ), though the generally recognized rale for- 
merly as well as now is to divide according to the number of sons 
i. e puhabttga ( ignoring the-fact of their being horn from 1M6 
different mothers). For example, Gaut 28 15 recommends 
that partition should be made by grouping the sons according 
to their mothers and then allowing a special share to the eldest 
among each group of sons Both Br. (S. B E 33 p 372 verse 15) 
and Vyasa 11 ' 7 lay down that if there be many sons sprung from 
the same father, who are equal in caste and number but who 
are the sons of different mothers, a division according to mothers 
may be legally made Such a partition on the basis of mothers 
is Tecognized in rare cases even now on 1148 the ground of custom 
in certain places and among certain castes 

A paternal grandmother or step-grandmother cannot herself 
demand a partition, but when a partition takes place between 
her son s sons, her own son being dead or when it takes place 
between her son and the sons of a deceased son she is entitled 
to a share A test of Vyasa says«» "the childless wives of 
the father are declared to be entitled to a share equal ( to that

On account of certain bodily, mental or other defects and 
certain conduct also persons were excluded in ancient India 
from demanding a share on partition and also from taking by 
inheritance Gaut 28 41, £p Dh. S. II 6 14 1, Vas. 17 53-63,

inheritance) such as lunacy, idiocy, impotence, excommunica- 
tion for grave sins or lapses of conduct, blindness, incurable 
disease, entering a different asrama (viz that of forest hermit 
or samujU^a ). These grounds of exclusion probably arose from 
the fact of the persons labouring under them being regarded as 
incompetent to perform religious acts and from the close 
connection between property and its use for religious purposes

one who m suffering from an incurable or irremediable bodily 
defect is not entitled to undertake vedic rites, such as Agni-

Kat. (852) and Br ( S. B. E. 33 p 371 verse 10 ) contain similar 
remarks. The Mit. does not accept this proposition, which argues 
that on that hypothesis no gifts (apart from sacrifices) that are 
recommended by the sastraswillbe possible, nor can one accom- 
plish two of the ptMUs3rt?MS 1156 viz. aittta and K&ma { as required

only mean that whatever wealth ib collected for sacrifices 
should he spent only for that purpose even by the sons of the 
man who colleoted it, since a smrti text condemns generally 
everyone who does not spend wealth collected for a sacrifice for 
that purpose to becoming a crow or a bhasa ( a cock or water 
fowl) in the next life The Mit. further argues that the view 
would be opposed to the conclusion of Jaimini III 4. 20-24

The most famous passages on the grounds of exclusion from 
inheritance are Manu IX 201, Ya] II. 140 and Nar. ( dayabhaga,

E^enthoujh they be a»o» sons stall not get a share; 
now can a ksetraja (a son of the wife raised by another person 
by appointment) get a share (if be bas these defects) and 
persons afflicted with long standing (like phthisis) and severe 
diseases (like leprosy), persons who are either idiots, insane or 
lame— these must be maintained by the family, but their sons 
are entitled to a share". These verses of Manu.Yaj andNar. 
have been quoted and explained in numerous decisions d^ the 
courts in India, but all such cases are mostly of academic inte- 
rest now since the passing of the Hindu Inheritance (Disabi- 
lities Eemoval ) Act of 1938 and hence need not be dwelt upon 
here. The Act ( XII of 1928 ) applies to the whole of British 
India except to persons governed by the DSyahhSga school and 
provides that no person governed by the Hindu Law, other than 
a person who is and has been from birth a lunatic or idiot, shall 
be excluded from inheritance or from any right or sbare in 
joint family property by reason only of any disease, deformity 
or physical or mental defect. This Act is not retrospective 
and does not confer on any person any right in respect of any 
religious office ot service or any right to the management of any 
religious or charitabl3 trust which he would not have had before 
the Act. Therefore under the Act the only defects that would 
disqualify a person governed by the Mitaksara school from claim- 
ing partition or inheritance are congenital lunacy and congenital 
idiocy. Under the Dayabhaga school the grounds of exclusion 
will still remain as before except as modified by Judicial deci- 
sions and by other Acts. An important question under the 
Mit school arises in this way. What is the exact position of a 
son that is congenitally idiotic or insane Both Manu (IX. SOI 
and S03) and Yaj (n 140, 141) declare that they are anamsa or 
mrcaniaka ( not entitled to a share of the ancestral estate ), but 
must be given maintenance and if maintenance be not given 
by those who are liable to give it, they would incur sin (as 
Manu IX. 202 expressly says ) and that the sons of disqualified 
persons take a share, if they are themselves free from defects- 
If A has a son B who is congenitally idiotic, is B still a copar-

cener of A (though not entitled to ashare or to claim partition) 

so that A cannot make a gift of the whole or a portion of the 

property or a bequest thereof to his widow ? This question arose 

in Annrtliammal v. Valhmayd I L R ( 1942 ) Mad. 807 ( F B ) 

where it was decided that, when A made a will jn the above' 

circumstances bequeathing all family property absolutely to his 

widow and two sons were born to the disqualified man B after A's 

death, the father had no power to make a will as the disqualified 

member B was still a coparcener (though not entitled to a share) 

and that he transmitted the heritage to his sons The chief 

ground of the decision was a passage of the Sarasvativilasa 

( explained on pp. 817 and 828-830) which is quoted below lls *. 

The grounds of disqualification apply to males and females 
alike, as stated by the Mit. on Yaj H. 140 1160 . A few remarks will 
be made on patita and his son The commission of every sinful act- 
did not make one patita as the word was technically understood. 
There were various grades among sins, which will be described 
in the section on patakas The grave sins were differently 
enumerated by different ancient writers In explaining 11 * 1

disqualified persons cannot themselves enjoy a share, yet they do have a share 
( in theory) and if they can marry or are eligible for marriage their sons that 
are free from defects do take a share and that one cannot lay down a sweeping 
proposition thai all congenially dumb or insane persons or idiots can marry, 
but that there are degrees in these defects and in certain extreme circum- 
stances these disqualified persons cannot marry Vide Madras Law Journal for

states that there are five grave sins {mahSpdtalxts) viz. violating

robbing a brahmana of gold and contact with, a patrfa by being 
bis teacber or pupil or priest or by contracting a matrimonial

different list of patawya actions viz. sea voyage, robbing a 
brahmana of his wealtb and misappropriating a deposit, per- 
jury for land, trading in (forbidden) articles, service under 
a siidra and having a cbild from a sfidra woman. Manu XI

known mahapatakas, viz. murder of a brahmana, drinking of 
liquor, theft, incest and continuous association for a year with 
these. Association with any sinner of any sort for one year 
made the associater guilty of the same sin ( Yaj. HI. 261). 
Samsarga or samyoga ( contact or association ) was of various 
kinds. Manu XI 180 ( =_Santi 165.37 = Baud. Dh. S. H. 1. 88= 
Vas. 1. 22 ) states that a person who associates with a pattta 
for a year as regards using the same vehicle or seat or taking 
food with him in the same row becomes patita ; but lie becomes 
patita at once by being his sacrificial priest or by being his 
teacher of the Veda or by entering into 1163 a matrimonial 
alliance with him. Vrddha-Brhaspati liM ( quoted by Mifeksara 
on YSj HI. 261 ) states that association ( sanlcaia ) with a patita 
is of nine kinds viz. occupying the same seat or bed, takiDg 
dinner in the same row with him, cooking food in his cooking 
pots, partaking of cooked food prepared by him, being a sacri- 
ficial priest or employing him as a priest, being his teacher of 
the Veda or making him one's teacher of the Veda, giving him 
one's daughter in marriage or taking his daughter in marriage, 
taking food with him in the same pot. Devala ltts declares that 
sin is passed on from one man to another by conversation ( with 
a sinner), by touching him, by his breath (coming in close 
contact with one's nose ), by occupying the same vehicle (horse) 
or seat, by eating ( in his company ), by being a priest for him 
or by making him one's priest, by being his teacher of Veda or 
making him one's teacher or by matrimonial alliance, ine 
same causes that led to a male being patita operated in the case 
of a woman to make her pattta-, there was one additional cause 
via a woman became patita by sexual connection with a male 
o a lower class than herself (Gaut U 9, ?kj HL 297 and 
launaka 1 " 6 ) The ancient sages were very considerate even

to fallen women. They provide that even women that are patit a 
and have not yet performed the proper penanee were not to be 
oast on the streetB, but they were to be given a hut ( near the 
house ) foT residence and bare maintenance that would keep 
body and soul together and were to be guarded against further 
lapses ( Yaj. HL 296 ). Vide H. of Dh. vol. H pp. 571-573. 

How far unohastity will debar a female from inheritance 
will be discussed a little later on. Adultery in general was an 
upapataka only according to Manu XL 59 and the ordinary 
penance for it was candrayana or gowata ( Manu XI. 117 }. But 
if the adultery was with a person of low caste, the woman 
became patita and would not have been entitled to a share on 
partition ( as a wife or mother ) under the old Hindu Law. 

In the case of those guilty of grave BinB who did not 
perform, the prSyascittas prescribed for such sins there was a 
peculiar procedure called ghataspliota prescribed for excommuni- 
cating them and severing all connection with them and treating 
them as dead, which has been described in H. of Dh vol H 
p, 388. Vide Gaut. 20. 2-7, Manu XL 182-184, Taj. m 294. 
But when the sinner performed the appropriate prayascitta 
(penance), the smrtis declare that he became fit to be associated 
with {vvamharya), he was to be welcomed by his relatives 
who were to take a bath along with him in a holy river or the 
like and who were to throw in the water an unused jar filled 
with water he should offer grass to cows in the midst of Ms 
relation^ they were not to find fault with him later on. VMe 
Manu XL 186-187 Yaj DX 295,299, Vas. 15. 20, Gaut 20- 10-14 
( which prescribes the recital of certain Vedic mantras and tit 

there is no return for him to his relatives «» Tn f£ w- 
1163. Vide Appcnflxx,

sequences of the Bin altogether but the sinner became fit to be 
associated with ( Yaj. JR. 226 ). In the case of the patita, even 
his son born after he committed a grave sin was held to be 
patita by most writers of smrtis ( YSj H. 140, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 
35-36, Kaut HI. 5 ) 116 ». But in the case of the daughter a 
difference was mercifully made. Vas. ( 13 51-53 ) 1,TO states "the 
sages say that one born of a patita becomes a patita, except a 
female child, since she is to go to another (person as his wife); 
one may marry her without accepting any wealth ( of her 
patita father ) along with her ". Yaj IEL 261 also says that the 
daughter of a patita may be married after making her fast and 
after making her leave everything (belonging to the patita 
father ) in her father's house. Visvarupa ( on Yaj HI. 257 ) quotes 
a prose passage from Harlta to the following effect : the daughter 
of a patita should have fasted one day and night, should take 
a bath without clothes, should put on white and new garments 
in the morning, should loudly repeat thrioe * I do not belong to 
him ( my patita father ) nor is he anyone to me ' and then she 
may be married at a Bacred place ( river etc. ) or in one's (the 
bridegroom's) house. , 

These rules about a patita led to this result that if a Hindu 
changed his religion or was excommunicated or was made an 
outcast for some lapse that his caste looked upon with great 
diBfavour, he was deemed to have lost his rights of partition or 
inheritance. The Caste Disabilities Eemoval Act (XXI of 1850) 
abrogates these rul es of the ancient »» Hindu Law ... .

HI ] Biglila of disqualified persons 617 

All the Bmrtis Bay that those who ate deprived of their 
rights to partition on aeoount of the several defects mentioned 
are entitled to maintenance out of the family property 
as long as they are alive (Gaut, 28. 41, Vas. 17. 54, 
Visnu Da. S. 15. 33, Manu IX. 202, Yaj.IL 140 etc.). H the 
disqualified persons want to marry or are married, then their 
sonless wives that are chaste should be maintained (Yaj. Q. 142), 
but those that are unohaste should ha driven out and so also 
those wives that ate hostile to the family; but the Mit. adds 
that even hostile wives of disqualified heirs must be maintained 
provided they are chaste. If the disqualified person has an 
aurasa son or fcstfraja Bon 11 "" who is frea from the defects 
mentions i above ( suoh as impotence ) he becomes entitled to 
a share of the joint family property and the daughters of dis- 
qualified persons ate entitled to be maintained in the family 
and ptovisionmust be made for their marriages (Manu IX. 203. 
Yaj. H. 141). It follows that disqualified heirs could not adopt, 
since Yaj H. 141 mentions only aurasa and ksetraja sons. 
Many of the smrtis did not allow even maintenance to the 
■pakta and his son (vide Baud. Dh. B. E. 2. 46, Kant m, 5 
Davala, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 35-36 ). Coparceners were prevented 
from claiming a share at a partition if at the time of the partition 
they were labouring under the defects mentioned above But 
if after partition^the defect which disqualified a member be

removed by medical treatment or the like then the disqualified 
member was entitled to reopen the partition on the analogy of 
a posthumous son born after partition. So also if a person is 
quite free from defeot when he takes at a partition a Bhare in 
joint family property or inherits, subsequently supervening 
defeot does not divest the property once vested in him. 

Some of the smrtis contain rules that appear to be only 
recommendatory. S.p. Dh. 1173 S. 1L 6. 14. 15 says that if even the 
eldest son or brother were to waste joint wealth in immoral 
or improper ways he should be given no share ( by the father or 
brothers at a partition). To the same effect are Gaut. 28. 38 and 
Manu IX. 214. 

Gaut. 28. 43 and Visnu Dh. S. 15. 37 provide 1I7t that the sons

olass ) are to be dealt with like the sodb of a brahmana from a 
sudra woman i. e they would be entitled to maintenance from 
their father, though pratiloma unions were condemned. Est. 
( 862-864 ) provides that the son of a woman married out of her 
order, one who is born of a sagotra union and one who is an 
apostate from the order of ascetics do not obtain ancestral 
wealth ; but the son of a woman married in the wrong order 
lakes the ancestral wealth if he is of the Bame class as his 
father, and the son of a woman who is not of the Bame caste as 
the huBband ( but of a lower oaste } and is married in the proper 
order takes the wealth of the father. But the son of a woman

united with a man in the reverse order of castes does not take 
the ancestral estate ; but the approved view is that he should be 
given food and raiment till his death by the kinsmen. In case 
there are no kinsmen such a son takes the whole wealth of his 
father and if the father left no wealth kinsmen are not bound to 
maintain him. 

Provision must also be made before ordering partition in 
a suit for partition by a brother for the marriage expenses of the 
unmarried sister or Bisters of the brothers Here there has been 
a great divergence of views among the writers of digests and 
commentaries. Kaut.III.5 (quoted below in » 1181),VisuuDh.S.18, 
35 and 15. 31 and Br. Bimply state that wealth for the marriage 
expenses of the unmarried sisters must be set apart But Manu 
IX.'118,Yaj.n.l24andKat.(858) 117s state that the brothers 
should get their unmarried sisters married by giving them one 
fourth share. The Mit. explains 1 " 6 that this does not mean that 
each brother is to give one fourth of his share to the sister ( for in 
that case if there aTe five brothers and one unmarried sister she 
may get more than each brother ) but that the unmarried sister 
is to get one fourth of what she would have got if she were a 
male and that if a person hae sons and daughters from wives 
of different classes then the unmarried daughter of the wife of 
each class will take one fourth of what her brother from the 
same mother would have taken. The Mit. further adds that 
one should not explain that the word "one fourth" is not to 
be taken literally and that the unmarried sister gets only as 
much as ls necessary for her marriage, since such an ^pTana- 
turn is opposed to the express words of Manu IX. 118 and since 
Manu declares sinfulness as the consequence of n^giX* 
one fourth share. The Mit. informs « B tllatits eX planationTas

marriage and not to a definite Bhare ). The DayabhSga held the 
opinion 1177 that if ancestral wealth was email, the provision for 
the marriage of the unmarried daughter should be made by 
giving her a fourth share but if the wealth was ample then she 
should get only as much as was necessary for her marriage. The 
Sm. a, V. R. p 494, V. C. p. 134 follow the view of Bhflruci, 
while the V. M, (p. 106), Madanaratna and V.P. (p.456fi) 
follow the Mit. The former group particularly relies on the 
texts of Devala 1178 ( wealth necessary for marriage should be 
given to unmarried daughters from the paternal estate ). Sankha 
< when partition of heritage takes place the unmarried daughter 
takes the maidenly trinkets, wealth for her marriage expenses 
and strldhana ) and Visnu Dh. S. 15. 31. Jn modern times the 
Courts allow no share to unmarried daughters but only provi- 
sion for marriage expenses and this top is restricted to the 
unmarried sister of a person who requires or sues for partition 
and does not hold good as to the daughters of brothers or other 
collaterals n7i . In Bhagaeali Shulail v. Bam Jalan 45 All. M? it 
was held (at p. 399) that "quarter share" in the text means 
as much money as will suffice for marriage expenses, and that 
where the daughter was a cripple and blind and all the property 
was worth Es 500 an alienation of the whole of it by the 
Widowed mother for raising a dowry 'for the daughter was 
justifiable. >

Before allotting shares provision must be made <*&<f®* 

joint family property for the payment of joint family debts "», 

for the personal debts of the father that are not immoral or 

illegal, for small gifts of affection made by the father, the 

maintenance of disqualified coparceners and female dependent 

members and for marriage expenses. Vide Mann VHL 166 ( as to 

family debts), Yaj ILU?,Nar. ( dayabhaga 32 ) and Kat. 850 

(for payment of father's debts and gifts of affection) and 542-43 

(for the various legal necessities 1180 ) If brothers want to 

separate and some of them aTe already married and others are 

unmarried then provision must be made for the samskaras (such 

as marriages) of the latter from the joint family property. 

Even Kautilya makes provision for the marriage of unmarried 

brothers and sisters 1181 . Yaj II 124, Hfir. { dayabhaga 33 ), Br. 

( S. B. E. 33 p. 373 verse 31 ) lay down that the safttsl&ras

It lias already been seen that a father could during his life 
time separate his sons from himself and also among them- 
selves 1182 * and that he could assign shares of property to his 
sons. This power of the father is indicated even m tho Tai. 
S. III. 1. 9. 4 ( quoted above in note] 055) which refers to the 
story of Manu having distributed his wealth among his sons. 
It U argued by &p. Dh. S. II 6. 14. 11 that, as this Vedic te\t 
( Tai. S. ) does not expressly state that any difference was made 
by Manu as to the Bhares of his sons, the division must have 
been equal, that therefore the preference of the eldest son is 
forbidden by the sastras and that when the Tai. S. II. 5. 2. 7 
states that " they distinguish the eldest by ( a larger share of ) 
the wealth " that is not a rule, but a mere anuvada ( a statement 
of fact ) and the Vedic passage only Tecites what some people 
do in spite of the rule of the sastias. The general rule, in the 
absence of express provision to the contrary, is equal distribu- 
tion, as stated in Jai. X. 3. 53 {samam syad-airiiMuit) which is 
relied upon by the prima facie view in Mit on Yaj. II. 265. 
ITrom the Tai S. it appears that both practices viz. equal 
division of property among all sons and giving a larger share 
to the eldest were wellknown m those far-off ages. Ap H. 6.

u 7 clearly" 83 states that in eome countries gold rablack 
LVbSproduce of the eat* is the fecial ) share of the 
eldest Almost all the sfitras and emrtis prescribe the rule of 
equal division among the sons of wives of the same class as the 
father (vide S?. Dh. S. II. 6. 14 1, Baud DhJ S. B. 2.2-3, 
ManuIX156, Yaj. H. 117, Visnu Dh. S. 18. 36 Kau*. EL 5, 
Br S.B.E.33p.37Lv.l0,'K&t.838). Some of these no doubt 
refer to the special share or provision given to the eldest (called 
vMWia). Kaut. says "the father in a partition during his 
own life should not give a special share to one out of (several 
sons, nor should he deprive a son of a share without any 
cause"** (such as blindness etc. )." Kat, 843 says the same 
thing in almost the same words. Bat from certain passages when 
construed literally (such as Yaj. H. 116, Far, dayabhaga 15 ) it 
appears thatthe early Indianf ather often distributed the ancestral 
wealth among his sons just as he pleased. Nar ( dayabhaga 
15} U8S says: "When a father has distributed his property amongst 
his bods that is a lawful distribution for them ( and cannot be 
set aside ), whether the Bhare of one be less or greater than or- 
equal to the shares of the rest ; for the father is the lord of all ". 
To the same effect is Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 370 v. 4) who adds 
that if they try to alter the arrangement ( made by the father ) 
they shall be punished. But later on these passages were 
either held to apply to former ages ( V. Mayukha p. 99 Says so > 
or to the self-acquired property of the father (Mit. on Yaj. 
EL 114) or were so interpreted as to mean'that the partition 
made by the father could not be annulled jf it was legal, but if 
illegal it could be set aside ( Mit. on Yaj. H 116, Madanaratna, 
MadanapSrijata p. 646). Mar. ( dayabhaga 16 ) himself denies 
authority to the father to give shares to the sons as he pleases

when he is Buffering from diseases, is angry ( with a son or 
sons ), or is engrossed in pleasures or pursues paths opposed to 
sSstraB. 

The eldest son has received special treatment in all ages 
down to modern times (vide p 566 ahove ). That treatment took 
various forms Sometimes the texts say that the eldest son 
took the whole estate. £p. H 6. 14. 6, Manu IX. 105-107, Tffar . 
(dayehhSga 5) refer to this view. Manu (IX 105-107) allows the 
eldest son to take the entire paternal estate, provides that the 
other sons should depend for their maintenance on the eldest 
eon as on the fathor, remarks that the eldest hy the mere fact 
of his birth enables the father to free himself from the debt to 
the ancestors and that therefore he ( the eldest ) deserves to 
get from the father the entire estate. 1186 

Another mode of dealing with the privileges of the eldest 
son was to give him some excellent or valuable article and 
then to distribute the rest equally. The Tai S. H 2. 2. 7 seems 
to have been understood by Sp. Dh. S. H. 6. 14. 1 and Baud. 
Dh. S. H. 2. 2-5 11W in this senBe. Manu IX 114 says that the 
eldest may get the best of all the items of wealth, whatever is 
the most eminent and the best of a group of ten cattle. Br. 
( & B. E 33 p. 371 verse 8 ) is to the same effect. Kaut. HL 6 
points out that according to Usanas among the sons born of 
the same mother, goats shall be the special share of the eldest 
among brahmanas, horses among ksatriyas, cowb among 
vaisyas and sheep among sudras, that if there be no quadrupeds 
the eldest was to take an additional share of one-tenth of tie 
whole property excepting precious stones, since he releases toe 
father from fetters ( of Hell ) by offering sraddha. Km*. bra- 
self holds that the eldest should get the vehicle and ornamen to 
ofhisfather (after the latter's ^ath); the mid^most J« 
bed, seat and the bronze plate from which the » tookhi 
meals ; and the youn gest should get black gramjhk^me;,

iron, domestic utensils and the bullock cart. Harlta 1188 says : 
" at a partition tbe eldest should get a bull, the meet precious 
wealth, the images for worship and the ancestral house, the other 
brothers should go out and build new houses or if there be a single 
house the eldest should get the southern (or best) portion ". This 
special allotment to the eldest is called uddhma ( lit. what is 
first taken out ) in Manu IX. 115-116 and Visnu Dh. S. 18. 37, 
and Baud, employs the form "uddharet". There were other 
methods also prescribed for special distribution of wealth. 
Gaut. 28. 5 says that the eldest should get one-twentieth of the 
whole as a special share, a bull and a cow, a cow, a chariot to 
which horses, asses or mules are yoked and a bull. Manu IX. 
112 provides that the special share of the eldest was one- 
twentieth of the whole property and whatever was the most 
valuable out of the ancestral property, the middlemost son 
should get half of this ( i. e. one-fortieth part ) and the youngest 
one-fourth of this ( one-eightieth of the whole ). Manu IX li7 
states that when no valuable items are taken out for the eldest 
the latter should get two shares, the son next to him one share 
and a half and the other sons one share each. Vas. 17. 42 ITar 
(dayabhaga 13), Br. (S. B. B. vol. 33 p. 371 verse 9 ) also' give 
two shares to the eldest, the latter "*> making it to depend on the 
possession of learning and good qualities by the eldest. Similarly 
Nar (dayabhagal2), Br. (S.B.E. vol 33p.370 verse5) provide 1 " 
that when the father makes a division during his lifetime he 
may retain two shares for himself. Sankha-Likhita allowed this

f„Jl Cm ™\ 0t ,?™ tUere was a IevuIsion <* Popular 
feeling awunrt allowing a special 8 hare to the eldest son and 
even to the father. Kit. (838)»» states that where the parents 
and brothers divide the whole joint property in equal shares 
tfiat IB a just ( or legal J division. Br. (S. B. K 33 "' 3 p 370 
verse 2) declares that the father and sons are entitled to equal 
shares in lands and houses that are ancestral, but in property 
acquired by the father the sons cannot claim a share against 
the will of the father. The V. M (p. 95) remarks on this 
that it follows impliedly that in the wealth acquired by the 
grand-father or other (remoter) ancestor, the sons can demand 
a partition even against the father's desire. 

According to Manu DC 125, » M if all wives of a person are 
of the same caste, then the son who is born first (even from a 
wife who is junior i e married later ) is the eldest son and 
that among twins the one that is born first is the eldest 
(verse 126), just as in the Subrahmanya 1193 texts the invoca- 
tion of Indra is made by the name of the first-horn. But if 
he has wives of different castes then the son of the wife of his 
own caste is the eldest (though born later) and the son of a 
wife of a lower caste though born first would be postponed.

same as Manu IX. 125. Maim IX. 123 and Gaut. 28. 16 appear 
to conflict with Maim IX. 125 and probably refer to some 
other ancient text or opinion The V. MayQkha (pp. 97-98) notes 
that in Bome medical works and in the ( commentary on the ) 
Bhagavata Furana HI 17. 18, it is said that among twins the 
one born later is deemed to be the elder, bat that this, being 
opposed to the indications contained in the Vedic Subrahmanya 
formula and in Manu IX. 126, has no bearing here ( but only 
in medical matters ). The Nirnayasindhu (IH PfiTvardhap. 251) 
makes a reference to the Bhagavata. 

General feeling went so much against allowing a special 

share to the eldeBt or allowing the father to make an unequal 

division among his sons, that such action was condemned in the 

same breath with myoga, 1196 or the sacrifice of the cow called 

Anubandhya. It is very instructive to follow the agruments of 

the Mit. and other writers on this point The oldest extant 

commentator, Medhatithi, on Manu IX. 112 shows that even 

before his time there were writers that held that the 

texts of Manu on myoga and on the special share to the eldest 

at a partition were in vogue only in bygone days and not in 

their dayB, that the rules of the smrtis were conditioned by 

time and country, just as sattras of long duration, though 

declared in the Vedic texts committed to memory by Vedic 

students, were not being performed and just as Manu ( I. 85 ) 

declares that the dharmas were different in different ytigas. But 

Medhatithi 1197 does not accept this reasoning, denies that 

different dharmas are prescribed for different yugas and holds 

that there is no restriction as to the dharmas to be performed in 

a country. Though sattras may not be performed now still it is 

possible to perform them. The argument of the Mit. on Y&j.

1L 117 5s briefly as follows 1 " 8 .*— Unequal division though found 
in the sastras ( e. g. Manu IX. 105, 112, 116, 117, Yaj. U. 114 ) 
should not be practised because it has come to be condemned 
( or has become hateful to ) by the people, since there is the 
prohibition ( in Yfij 1 156 ) that an action, though prescribed 
in the sastraa, Bhould not be performed when it has come to be 
condemned by the people, since such an action does not lead to the 
attainment of Heaven. For example, though Ysj. 1 109 prescribes 
the offering of a big ox or a goat to a learned brahmana guest, it 
is not now practised because people hare come to hate it; or just 
as, although there is a Vedic text laying down the sacrificing of a 
cow " one should sacrifice a barren cow called anubandhys for 
Mitra and Varuna ", still it is not done because people condemn 
it. And it has been said " just as the practice of myoga or the 
killing of the anubandhys cow is not now in vogue, so also 
division after giving a special share ( to the eldest son ) does 
not now exist". Ipastamba alBO (H. 6.14. 1-14) prescribes 
equal division, refers to the view of some that the eldest takes 
the whole estate, shows that allotting a special share to the 
eldest is the view of some and refutes it as opposed to the 
sSstras by quoting the Vedic text " Manu divided his wealth 
among his sons ". Therefore unequal division though found in 
the sSstra should not be practised as it is opposed to popular 
sentiments and to the Veda and so Ytj. (H. 117) gives the 
restrictive rule that in partitioning there must be equal divi- 
sion. The Sm. C. (Up. 266 ) tells us that Ebaresvara also 
did not discuss passages like Manu IX. 112 since he said that 
the practice ( of uddharavibhaga ) had been altogether given up 
by the people 11 * 9 .

The Sm.O. finds fault with Visvarnpa for saying" that just as 
the offering of an ox or a goat to a learned brShmana is not 
practised because the practice of the sistas is against it, so 
uddhara is not practised. It says that when there is a conflict 
between a smrti text and iistacara, the latter is the weaker ( of the 
two ) and cannot refute the Bmrti text as laid down by Vas. 
X 4-5. Further not offering a bull cannot be said to be sist&eara, 
but it is really the' absence of sistaeara. The Sm. O. finds fault 
with the Mit. for saying that people have come to condemn a 
special share for the eldest. It says that, on the contrary, if a 
special share is given to the eldest who is endowed with learn- 
ing, good qualities or holy actions then people commend such a 
procedure. The Madanaratna 1200 quotes the verse "yatha 
niyoga &c, " and a verse from the iLdipuTana The V. P. 1SM 
(pp 442-443) generally follows the Mit., but criticizes it by 
saying that there is no real iruti-wrodlia ( opposition to a Vedic 
text). If that were so, as Sruti (the Veda) is promulgated for all 
ages, unequal division would be forbidden in all ages and it 
would follow that the particular sruti' passages speaking of

unequal divisJon are without authority, since it (unequal divi- 
sion ) could not have been practised in other ages also (but™ 
a matter of fact it was); besides Baud, sets ou! another VedS 
text winch mentions unequal division. The V. P. desiring to 
guard against tho rather wide statement that whatever is 
condemned by the people should not be practised holds that the 
word loka-In Yaj.1. 156 means "yuga"; otherwise there 
would be confusion about what is proper conduct and what does 
not load to Heaven. The condemnation by low or ordinary 
people who are quite innocent of sastras cannot make an action 
incapable of leading to Heaven, since such people might con- 
domn the hitnsa{ slaughter) of the animal offered to Agni and 
Soma. The above discussion illustrates how practices once 
recognized by Vedic passages and by the people gradually 
fell into disuetude and how reason and the common sense 
of ordinary people asserted themselves even against Vedic 
and smrti texts. The Mit. is very clear in its statement 
that whatever comes to be hated by the people in 
general should not be practised, even though it was once 
practised and has the support and authority of Vedic and smrti 
texts behind it, Those who desire change in social customs 
and the practices of the people in various directions rely on 
this text of Yaj. and on similar texts 15 " 2 of Manu IV. 176 and 
Vi3nu Dh. S. 71. 85 and on the Mit. for authority. Orthodox 
writers like Mitramisra therefore have to twist plain words 
like " loka ", since they cannot tolerate the idea that common 
people can have anything to say in what these writers believe 
to be the injunctions of the sastro. Instead of candidly saying 
that ancient practices came to be modified by common people, 
writers like Mitramisra say that common people should not 
be listened to in these matters, that each y«#ahasite own 
peculiar practices and that common people have no authority 
to change sastric practices prescribed by the texts for a 
particular age It is sheer quibbling to say that not offering^ 
bull is not sistacara, but absence of sistScara; what is clear is 
that common people ahhorred the practice of niyoga and the 
killing of a cow in a sacrifice and writers of sutras and srartis 
fell into line with them and prohibited such practices in the

HI ] Vestiges of larger share to eldest son 631 

Kali age, though they were either permitted or ( even ) enjoined 
by the Vedio texts ; that is, the voice of the common man or 
his revolt was allowed to prevail over the word of the 
sacred Veda. 

Though the assignment of a larger share to the eldest son 
or giving him the whole property ceased to be generally 
prevalent, vestiges of it are still found. There are certain 
estates in the nature of eammdanes or a raj that are impartible 
and descend by the rule of primogeniture to a single heir. 
Vide Baboo Gfunesh Bulla v. Mahaiaja Moheshui 6 Moo. I A. 164, 
Neelktsto v. Beer Chunder 12 Moo. 1. A. 533, Mohesh v. SattugJian 
29 I A. 62, Bam Nundun v. Maliaram Janla 29 L A. 178 , for 
examples of impartible estates. Sometimes by custom certain 
estates such as Deshmukh and Deshpande wtans have been 
held to be impartible. Vide Ramrao v. Yeshmntrao 10 Bom. 327 
and Gqpalrao v. Tnmbakrao 10 Bom. 598. In certain other cases 
a larger share ( called pjestham&a or motap ) has been allowed 
by custom to the eldest son at a partition. Vide Mamltcluind v. 
Hiralal 20 Oal. 45 { P. O. ), PrUIusmgji v. Umedsmgji 6 Bom! 
L. R. 98, Malubhai v. Sursangji 7 Bom. L. R. 821. 

The following propositions may be laid down about the 
allotment of shares on a partition: (1) When there is a parti- 
tion between a father and his sons each son takes a share equal 
to that of the father ; (2) where the partition is only between 
brothers all of them share equally; (3) on the death of a 
member leaving male issue his right to a share on partition 
passes to and is represented by his male issue ; (4) when there 
is a partition among members who are uncles and nephews or 
cousins, the allotment is per stirpes (according to the stock) 
as regards each branch and pS) - capita among the members of 
the same branch. This rule is expressly laid down™* by Kaut-

the son of the former a partaker of the ancestral wealth, when 
he has not obtained from his grandfather livelihood ( 1 e. Bhare 
of heritage ) ; he should obtain from his paternal uncle or the 
uncle's son the share which his father would have got (if alive) ; 
that very share would be the share aocording to law of all the 
brothers ( who are the sons of the deceased brother ). Or even a 
son (of that son of the brother dying) would obtain that share ; 
beyond this (i. e. beyond the grandson of the deceased brother) 
there is cessation (of the right to demand a share)". It was stated 
that in the ancestral property (padamaha dramja) sohb and 
grandsons equally have rights by birth, but in the case of the

apply the rale of per slope., division, the property that 
remained at the date of the suit of B i will be divided into three 
parts and B 1, 01 and D 1 ( who represent three stocks, B,0, B) 
will each got one third of that property. This was so decided 
in Pianjumidas v IcMtatam 39 Bom. 734. The Madras High 
Court, however, holds that the rule of per sfirjxs applies only 
whon all the coparceners desire a partition at the same time and 
that if only some members separate at one time and others on 
a later occasion, regard should be had to the share allotted at 
tho first partition in computing the share to be allotted at the 
second partition That is, according to the Madras High Court 
in tho above case B 1 will be entitled to one-third minus one- 
twolth (which latter was allotted to B3 when he left the 
family ), Tho Madras High Court says that its views are based 
not on strict principles of Hindu Law, but on necessary con- 
siderations of equity Vide Manjanatha v Narayana 5 Had. 362 
and Narayana v Shankar 53 Mad. 1 (FB at p. 6 ). 

Manu ( IX. 47 ) emphatically states : 1203<I " once is a parti- 
tion made, once is a maiden given in marriage, once does a 
man say 'I shall make a gift of this or that '; these three are done 
only once by the good ". This means that a partition once made 
is final and cannot ordinarily be reopened But there are excep- 
tions to this rule. One viz. about the posthumous son born 
after partition has already been mentioned above ( pp. 595-597 ).

leaving the country common to himself and his co-sharers goes 
to another country, his share must undoubtedly he given to his 
descendant when the latter comes hack to the original country. 
.Whether he ( the descendant ) be the third or fifth or even seventh 
in descent (from the man who. left the country) he would get 
the Bhare that descends hereditarily provided his birth and 
family name are ascertained. The gotiajas (agnatic members 
of the family) should allow (a share in the ancestral) lands 
to the descendant of a man whom the maulas and neighbours 
know to" be a co-owner ( in the lands ) by descent, when he 
comes ( after a partition ) to demand his share ". The V. R. 
explains 1OTS that the rule of Devala ( given above ) about a 
claim to a share being allowed up to the fourth applies when all 
the members stay together in the same place or country, while 
the above rule of Br. allowing even the seventh in descent to 
claim his share after a partition has taken place applies where 
such descendant and his forefathers had migrated to a distant 
land. These rules of Br. indicate that, even after a long time, 
a descendant could claim his share in a joint family estate and 
no bar of limitation was allowed. 

Another rule is that where some property of the joint family 
had heen fraudulently concealed by one member and was dis- 
covered afterwards, or where some property was left out from 
partition either through mistake or accident, such property 
should be divided according to their shares among the persons 
who made the first partition. In this case there is no reopening 
of the partition once made, but there is another partition

is afterwards discovered, the sons should divide it equally with 
their brothers in the absence of the father { i. e. even after his 
doath ). Whatevor is concealed from each other ( by the co- 
sharers ) or what was divided in an unjust manner and whatever 
was recovered (such as debts) after (partition) should be 
partitioned in equal Bhares. This is the view of Bhrgu '. 

In the Ait Br. (VI. 7) 1JW it is said- 'He who deprives a 
person entitled to a share of his share, him he (who is deprived) 
punishes (or destroys). If he does not punish (or destroy) 
him (the depriver), then he punishes his son or grandson; but 
he does punish him '. Manu IX. 213 declares that even the 
oldest brother who through greed deprives his younger brothers 
(of their shares) ceases to be the eldest (i.e. forfeits his posi- 
tion as tho eldest), is deprived of his (special ) share (as eldest) 
and should be punished by the king. From these passages it 
follows that fraudulently concealing joint property or depriving 
a person of his share is condemned. This leads on to a 
divergence of views among commentators and digests. If a man 
conceals joint property at a partition, is he a wrongdoer or 
not ? What he conceals is partly his own. Therefore the 
Dayabhaga" 88 (XIII 8) holds that there is no theft in this case, 
since a thief is commonly understood to be one who knowing 
that some thing belongs to another, makes it his own without 
any ground for so doing; while a co-sharer cannot be said to 
be no owner at all of the joint property. The DSyabhaga 
(XIIL 11-13) says that Visvarupa and Jitendnya both held 
the same opinion that even if technically it may be called theft 
still there is no sin attaching to it as smrtis ^™*™»^°

( which declares even the eldest as punishable by the king if he 
deprives his younger brothers of their due share ) and the Ait. 
Br. there ib the fault of theft in case a co-sharer fraudulently 
conceals joint property. The Mit. and V. P. further rely upon 
an example derived from the Purvamimamsa in support of 
their view. When a caru { boiled food 1 ) of mudga pulse is 
prescribed and mudgas are not available, some substitute must 
be employed just as when rice is not available nluara grain 
may be employed. The parts of niasa resemble those of mudga 
and some one may plausibly say that in the absence of mudgas, 
a oaru of masas may be used. To this Jai. VI 3 20 12M replies 
that, since inasns, vai akas and kodraoas are forbidden as being 
unfit for use in sacrifices, one cannot take parts of masas as 
substitute for parts of mudgas though both may be so similar 
as not to be easily distinguishable. So the general prohibition 
■against depriving another of his wealth holds good even in the 
case of goods that belong jointly to oneself and to others. The 
D&yabhaga ( XIII. 16 pp 237-228 ) tells us that a predecessor of 
it named Balaka relied on this very nyaya of Jaimini and finds 
fault with him It should be noted however that Kat. ( 888 ) re- 
commends that the king 1210 even if a complaint be lodged 
about fraudulent suppression by a co-sharer should not use 
force against the fraudulent suppressor but should 'make him 
give up the concealed property by persuasion or trick. Br. and 
Kst. 1JU declare that if there is a suspicion that some joint 
wealth has been concealed by a co-sharer, the hoia ordeal may 
be resorted to.

If there was a dispute whether a partition had already taken 
place, Yaj. JI 149 mentions some of the indications that lead 
to the inference or proof of partition viz. ' the determination of 
the dispute follows from the testimony of kinsmen, cognates

by ( the fact of ) houses and fields being separately held '2?Sr.

have separate transactions, they should be known as separate

a partition of joint family property, but it is not conclusive \ 121s 
Br. says that where there are no witnesses nor a document to 
prove partition, a conclusion may be arrived at by inference. ' 

A. few words may be said about the self-acquired property 
of the father or grand-father. According to the strict theory 
of the Mit the son 1216 acquires by birth an interest even in the 
self-acquired property of the father, but the Mit. makes it clear 
that the son has no power to prevent his father 'from disposing 
of his own self -acquisitions, but has to 'give his approval 
to his father's alienations of his' self-acquisitions. The Mit 
sets out two smrti texts via. ' though immovable property and 
bipeds may have been acquired by the father himself, there can 
be no gift nor sale of them without (calling together or) 
consulting all the sons. Those that are born, those that are 
unborn and those that are in ( their mother's ) womb expect 
maintenance ( and therefore ) there can be no gift nor sale \ 
But these have been treated by the Mit. and the Dayabhega 
also as more or less recommendatory If the father alienates 
his self-acquisitions without his son's consent he may be held 
guilty of transgressing a smrti precept but the transaction does 
hold good and is valid, 12 " since a fact cannot be altered by 
even a hundred texts (as the Dayabhaga puts it). It should 
not be supposed that the Mit. was the first to propound this 
right as to self-acquisitions. Centuries before, the Visnu Dh S 
17. 1 expressly declared that as regards self-acquired property 
the father has absolute discretion to divide it as he pleases

Eat. (839) also says that the son has no ownership in the 
father's self-acquisition. 1218 When Taj. IL 114 allows the father 
either to give the best share to the eldest son or to make an equal 
division among all sons, the Mit. explains that this unequal 
division holds good only as to the self-acquisitions of the father. 
Similarly when Nar. ( dayabh&ga 12 ) or Sankha-Likhita say 
that the father, may take two shares for himself, that is with 
reference to self-acquisitions, ace. to the Mit. Manu IX 104 
stating that sons have no power over property during the life 
of the parents refers to the self-acquisitions of the parents In 
modern times courts have followed the view that a Hindu 
father (or any Hindu person whatever) may give, sell or 
bequeath by will his self acquired property ( whether movable 
or immovable ) to any body he likes ( vide Rao Baluxmt Singh v 
Rani Ktshon 25 LA. p. 54 at pp. 67-68 where the two verses cited 
by the Mit were held to contain only a moral precept and not 
a rule of law capable of being enforced ). 

Mr Kishori Lai Sarkar in his Tagore Law Lectures on the 
Mlmamsa rules of interpretation states ( p 21 ) that ' Mitaksara 
bears the impress of Buddhistic influence '. For this proposition 
he advances hardly any substantial evidence that will bear 
scrutiny. His reasons are mostly subjective and he refers to 
no ancient or medieval Buddhistic texts that elaborate the 
principle of taking property by birth or the rule of propinquity 
in deciding questions of inheritance, which two are the most 
fundamental tenets of the Mitaksara system It appears that 
the evolution of the son's right to partition, of his equality 
witb his father, of the absolute rights of a person to me jwlf- 
acquisitions was a gradual indigenous growth and had nothing 
to do with Buddhistm thought. Buddhists had hardly any 
Tndtndent set of iunstic ideas or works different from th

' In the preceding pages reference has been frequently made 
to sons, to their rights in ancestral property by birth and to 
their shares on partition. It is now time to refer to the various 
kinds of sons, principal (miikhya) and gauna (subsidiary or 
seoondary ). 

In H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 560-561 passages from the JJgveda, 
the Tai. S , Sat. Br., Ait. Br., the sutras and smrtis emphasising 
the importance of a son for the spiritual welfare of a man have 
been cited. The principal purposes served by the birth of a 
son are succinctly stated in the Ait. Br. 33. 1. via. the son 
enables the father to pay off the debt he owes to his ancestors, 
to Becuie immortality ( amrtatva ) and heavenly worlds These 
were the main purposes deemed to he served by a son in most 
remote times. Manu ( IX. 106-107 ) and Yaj L 78 also mention 
these benefits. The desire was to continue and perpetuate the 
family (va/hiasya awcchedah as the Mit. has it) and to provide for 
the performance and preservation of religious saa a and offerings. 
This desire was common in ancient societies almost everywhere. 
The Sat. Br. XJX 4 3. 1 (B B. E. vol. 44 p 157) states 'the father

art born from each of the limbs, from the heart ( of the father ), 
thou art indeed one's own self called son ; maysfc though live 
for a hundred autumns 1'. Gradually the idea arose ( probably 
suggested by etymologists ) that the son saved the father from 
the Hell called put, 1221 as stated by Mann IX. 138 ( =£diparva 
229. 14 = Visnu Dh. S. 15. 44 ). The son's close connection with 
the offering of pindas to the ancestors is not much emphasized 
in the oldest works. But in the sutras, in Manu and the .other 
srartis this aspect of the benefits derived from the son is far 
more prominent than the others. In speaking of the putrika- 
putraManu (IX 136) declares 'he should offer pinda'( to his 
maternal grandfather ) and take the latter's wealth . Ab three 
descendants (son, grandson and great-grandson) presented 
pindas to the ancestor, all three had extravagant praisesbesto- 
wed on them Manu IX 137 says : ' a man secures the ( higher ) 
worlds through ( the birth of ) a son, he obtains permanence 
( in those worlds ) through a grandson, through the son of a 
grandson he wins the world of the Sun ' 12 ». The Visnudharma- 
sutra 85. 67 declares 1223 ' A man should desire to have many sons 
( with the thought ) that some one out of them may go to Gaya 
or offer the Asvamedha sacrifice or let loose (in honour of the 
deceased father ) a dark bull '. Br (a, in Par M. I. 2 p. 305 ) 
states : ' the pitrs afraid of falling into Hell desire to have sons; 
( they think) one of them may go to Gaya and that one will 
save us; he will set at liberty a bull, he may perform sacrifices 
and execute works of public utility (like tanks, temples and 
parks), he will take care of us in our old age, he wiir offer 
sraddha day by day '. The Matsyapurana 204 ( 3-17 ) contafos

they expect their descendants to do such as offering water in 
holy livers, sraddhas, going to Gays, gifts of various kinds, 
construction of tanks, &o. 

It is not, however, to be supposed that purely secular bene- 
fits to be derived from sons were not thought of at all. People 
were alive to them but those benefits were submerged under the 
flood of extravagant ideas about the spiritual benefits derived 
from Bons. For example, the Br. 1224 Up, L 5. 16, after mention- 
ing the three worlds of men, pitrs and gods, declares that the 
world of men can be won only through the son ( while in I, 5, 17 
there is eulogy of the son and instruction to him that he is 
Brahma, he is yajfia, he is the heavenly world). Nar. IV" 5 
says 12a " fathers wish to have sons on their own account think- 
ing in their hearts ' He will free me from low and high debts * ". 
Slat. (551) has a similar verse and makes the meaning of Nar. 
clear 12 * Vide above ( under rnadana pp. 416-417 ). 

Besides the aurasa, eleven or twelve kinds of subsidiary 
sons are mentioned by most ancient smrti ' writers. Ap. 
Dh. S. does not recognize any son except the aurasa. Ap. 
quotes certain verses which express the view of an anoient sage 
called Aupajanghani and which are also quoted by the Baud. Dh. 
S. according to which the aurasa was to be recognized as the only 
son (vide H. of Dh. Vol. H. p. 602 n 1417 for the quotation) 
Ap. n. 5. 13 10 emphasizes that there can be no real gift or sale 
of one's child ( dUnam krmjadhai maicapatyasi/a na mdyate ). But 
Ap. Dh. S. clearly shows that it knew that ksetraja sons were

raised and forbids that practice. In H. 6. 13. 1-5 1227 it states, 
' sons begotten by a man, who approaches in the proper season 
a woman of equal caste that has not belonged to another man 
( as wife ) and that has been married to him according to the 
sSsiras, have the privilege to follow the occupations (peculiar 
to their castes ) and to inherit property ; if a man has sexual 
intercourse with a woman who had been married before to 
another or was not married legally to him or belongs to a 
different caste, they both incur sin and through that ( i. e their 
sinfulness ) the son also becomes sinful '. In U, 10. 27. 3-6 Ap. 
condemns the practice of myoga 'a huBband ( or his elders ) 
shall not appoint a wife who occupies the position of a tagUta 
to others (who are not sagotra), for they declare that a bride 
is given to the family ( of the husband and not to the husband 
alone). This {practice of appointment) is forbidden (now) 
on account of the weakness of (men's) senses The hand of even

viz. as the son of the hegetter ( bym ) and as the son of the wife 
( i. e. of the husband of the wife ) and the son produced any- 
where ( as mentioned hy "Visnu Dh. S.) is 15th and the last. The 
Paiasarasmrti (IV. 83-24) mentions, besides Kunda and Golaka, 
only five kinds of sons. 

It is necessary, before proceeding further, to give brief definit- 
ions of the twelve or thirteen kinds of sons from Manu and other 
writers The legitimate son (aurasa) is one begotten by a man on 
his own wedded wife of the same caste. The putrikaputra 123 ° is 
of two kinds; (1) a sonless man may appoint his daughter as Ins 
son ( she ib then called put rika and treated as a son ) ; (2) or she 
may be given to a person in marriage with the stipulation ' I 
give you in marriage this brotherless girl decked with orna- 
ments; the son born of her will be my son'. In this case the 
son born of the daughter so given becomes the son of his mater-' 
nal grandfather. The ksetraja (the son of the wife) is one who 
is begotten on a man's wife (or widow) by a sagotra { agnatic 
kinsman) or by one not of the same gotra, according to the 
rules of mvoga, when the man himself is either dead or impotent 
or sufibrmg from ( an incurable ) disease. That is the son given

son of a remarried woman) is one to whom a woman, being aban- 
doned by her husband or being a widow, gives birth after slie 
contracts a second marriage of her own accord. He, who, 
having lost his parents or being abandoned by them without 
proper cause, gives himself to a man ( as a son ) is called 
suayamdatta (a son self-given). The son whom a brahmana 
begets through lust from a sudra wife is called pSrasava ( or 
saudra ), since he, though living, is ( like a ) corpse. 

The list of twelve or thirteen kinds of sons looks rather 
formidable, has puzzled and misled even great scholars into 
making all sorts of sweeping assertions and putting forward 
untenable theories about the origin and necessity of so many 
sons. For example, Dr. Jolly in his ' Becht und Sitte ' ( English 
tr. p. 156 ) observes * The twelve kinds of sonship, which to some 
extent are based on the illicit connection of the mother and for 
the greater part have nothing to do with the blood-relationship 
of the son with the father, are probably the most striking feature 
of Indian family law. The cause of this abnormal importance 
being attached to male issue is to be sought, according to the 
smrtis, in the offering of sacrifices to the manes which depends 
upon the male issue; 5 et, however, originally an economic 
motive was perhaps a more important factor in *£££» 
the family as many powerful workers as possible The iearnea

Bon, grandson or great-grandson could not have a putrikaputra, 
a fcaetraja or an adopted son. If the definitions of all the 12 
or 13 kinds of sons axe carefully analysed, it will be quite 
apparent that the long list is due to the ancient writers' great 
penclumt for divisions and Bub-divisions based upon very slight 
differences of circumstances The several kinds can be classi- 
fied into three or four groups as done by Devala. 1232 All the 
five sons called dutlaha, ki-Ua, hrtrima, svayafadatta and apaviddha 
axe sons who are affiliated by a person under various circumst- 
ances. There is no tinge of any illicit connection of the mother 
in any one of these, the one thing common to all of them 
being that they are the Bona of one man and are treated by 
another as his. Similarly the paivnarbhava and icatdra are the 
legal Bons of the man himself, but there is opprobrium attaching 
to them, because in the first case the mother contracted a re- 
marriage ( which was very much condemned by the smrtis ) and 
in the other a brahmana married a sudra woman ( which also 
was looked down upon, if not absolutely forbidden as done by 
Yaj. 1 56 ) The paunarbhava son of a dvtja is still called a 
dvija by Manu HL 181, but Manu only provides that he is not 
fit to be invited at a sraddba. The putrika (the daughter 
appointed as a son ) is the man's own child and the putrika- 
putra also is the man's own grandchild and both these are 
special cases of adoption and no question of mother's illicit 
connection arises in these. So out of 13 kinds of sons, nine were 
entirely free from any taint of illicit connection. There remain 
only the four viz. ksetraja, gadhotpanna, kanlna, sahodha. 
The ksetraja was in a class by himself and was a survival of an 
ancient practice prevalent in many countries all the world over, 
which had been condemned in India hy 5p. ( as shown above on 
p 644) and his predecessors several centuries before the Christian 
era. It may,however,bepomted out that some medieval writers 
held the view that several secondary sons like the dattaka, 
krita &c. could be had by a man having no aurasa son, 1232 «

The chief oonoem of the smrfcis as shown clearly by the 
Anusasanaparva (chap. 49 quoted above on p. 645) and the 
com. of NHakantha was to provide for the maintenance and 
the performance of the samskaras of those ohildren that may 
be either abandoned by their parents or may be under the 
cloud of illegitimacy. 

There is great confusion and contradiction among the 
Butras and smrtis about the place of the several kinds of eons 
and about their rights. For example, Gautama ( probably the 
most ancient , among extant sufcrakfiras) assigns the 10th 
place to the putrikaputra, while Band,, Kaia\, Yaj , Br. and 
Devala give him the 2nd place and Vasisflia, Sankha-Likhita, 
Nfir , and Visnu put him 3rd. The MtaJca is placed very low 
in the hat by most works except by Manu, G-aut , Baud., Br. and 
Brahmapurana (which put him 3rd or 4th). The 1% kinds are put 
in two groups by some works. Gaut. ( 28. 30-31 ) provides that 
the aurasa, ksetraja, datta,krtrima, gudbotpanna and apaviddha 
are nktfiabliBjah (take the wealth) and also belong to the gctra of 
the man whose sons they are, while the other six take only the 
gotra but not the wealth. Baud. Dh. S. ( H. 2. 36-37) employs the 
same words nktliabliaM a fid pob ao/wjafc but differs fromGaut in 
including putrikaputra among' rikthabhajah' and omitting him 
from the group of 'gotrabhsjah'. 1233 Another division (each 
having six kinds) is into bandhu-daySda or myMcMrdham 
(Manu IX. 158-159 and NSr. dayabhSga 47) and adayndabnndham 
{Manu IX. 160, Vas. 17. 38, Nar. dayabhBga. 47) The .first 
eroup, ace to Manu, comprises aurasa ( also putrika ), ksefcraaa,

only bandhavas ( i. e belong to the gotra of their father ), but 
cannot succeed to the wealth of their father's kinsmen. Here 
also there is no agreement among the smrtis. Vas. ( 17. 5-25 ), 
Sankha-Likhita ( q. in V R p 247 }, NaT. dayabhaga 47 and 
Hartta include in the firBt group aurasa, ksetraja, putrikaputra, 
paunarbhava, kanma and gudhaja and the rest in the 2nd group. 
Kaut asserts that only the auiasa son succeeds as heir to the 
kinsmen of bis father while the others ( that are not procreated 
by him ) succeed only to the father who brings them up, but 
not to his kinsmen Yaj II. 132 states that each of the twelve 
kinds mentioned by him takes the wealth of the father and 
offers pirujn to him in default of the preceding one and further 
requires that this is so only if it is certain that the sons are of 
the same oaste as that of the father. Gaut. 28. 32 states that 123 * 
the kanlna and the other sons called yotrabhd.jah ( in 28. 31 ) take 
only one fourth of the estate of the father if no aurasa nor any 
of the other sons called nltihabhajuh exists ( and the rest of the 
estate is taken by the sapindas ), while Kaut , Devala and K6t. 
( 857 ) state that the dattaka, ksetraja and other kinds of sons 
are entitled to one third share only if an aurasa is born 
provided they are of the same varm and that if they are of a 
different caste, they are only entitled to food and raiment. If a 
man, having no son, made his daughter a putrika or thinking 
himself to be impotent bad a ksetraja son or adopted a son 
and then an aurasa son was born, difficult questions of the dis- 
tribution of his property arose on which there was no un- 
animity. Manu IX. 163 says that only the aurasa son is 
entitled to all the paternal wealth and all the other kinds 
should be given maintenance in order to avoid the fault of 
being cruel. But as regards the case where a putrika is first 
made and then an aurasa is bom Manu (IX. 134) prescribes 
that these two should divide the paternal estate equally .^s w }jji e

Manu IX. 164 asks the aurasa to give 1/5 or 1/6 of the paternal 
wealth to the ksetraja This confusion and contradiction about 
the places and the shares of the several sons leads one to infer 
that the institution of several hinds of sons was not very 
common or generally recognized, was rather confined to some 
localities or communities and was dying out even in the times 
of the ancient smrtis, if it ever existed in full force at all 
at any time. 

As regards gudhaja, ksnlna and sahodha there is this to 
be said. They were the result of illicit connection ; but some 
one had to maintain them, to bring them up and be their 
guardian. The smrtis when they assign these as the sons of 
the husbands of the women of whom they are born are really 
providing for these matters of maintenance and guardianship. 
Br. says that dattaka, apaviddha.krlta, kxta, and saudra, if of pure 
caste and pure actions, are middling, while the ksetraja, paunar- 
bhava, kanlna, sahodha and gudhaja are condemned by the good 
(S B. E. 33 p. 376 verses 40-41 J. 1 * 6 The kanlna was to be 
under the guardianship of the father of the girl ( Yaj. 11 129 ) 
till she remained unmarried, but when she married the damsel'B 
son came under the dominion of the person who married her 
( Manu IX. 172 ). The very fact that the kanlna was assigned 
to the husband who married the girl shows that this was done 
because it was deemed that by marrying such a girl the 
husband condoned her past lapses. Similarly in the case of 
«//«#«, it was deemed that either the ohild must have been 
procreated by the husband himself before marriage or that he 
condoned the. conduct of the wife. It appears to have been 
thought that when the husband ( the party most concerned ) did 
not openly object it was not open or allowable for any one 
else even by proof that the child was kanlna o r sahodha to call 

J*,,, Tho^ver^sq^edby^P «»J£J I dialresS fc over 



TH\ Kanina, sakotpia, gti$?iaja 653 

for "the abandonment of the child. Similar remarks apply to 
the gfidhaj'a As shown in EL of Dh vol. H pp. 571-573 if the 
wife was guilty of adultery the husband had certain powers 
of correction over the wife, but if he chose to be complaisant, 
then the smrtis did not compel him to disown or abandon the 
child. These very smrtis ( like Gautama, Vas , JSTar. ) that are 
very harsh on women for adultery allow the gudhaja, kanina 
and sahodha to be secondary sons. So the only way in which 
these two attitudes can be reconciled is by holding that when 
the husband condones moral lapses on the part of the woman 
whom he had accepted as his wife the smrtis provide for the 
maintenance, guardianship and succession of such offspring of 
illicit connection. Even among medieval commentators there 
was divergence about paunarbhava, kanina, sahodha and 
gudhaja; Medhatithi on Manu IX. 181 holds that they are 
entitled to nothing but food and raiment in any case, while 
the Mit.( on Yaj.IL13Z) holds that even the kanina and the 
rest take the father's wealth in default of aurasa and the other 
kinds of sons. TheMit. (on Yaj. I. 90). however holds that 
kanina, sahodha and gudhaja being the outcome of adultery 
cannot be Bavarna with the husband of their mother, are really 
different from savarna sons and even anuloma and pratiloma 
sons. 

A good deal can be said about the spiritual benefit supposed 
to be derived from secondary sons. 

The high eulogy bestowed on the son in the Vedic and 
smrti literature has reference only to the ain asa sou. Manu IX 
180 asserts that the eleven kinds of sons viz. ksetraja and the 
resfc"( except aurasa and putrika ) are merely substitutes for the 
real bou, admitted to prevent the cessation of religious rites 
and in IX. 181 Manu states the final conclusion that such sons 
as the ksetraja that aTe procreated from the seed of others really 
belong to him from whose seed they spring and not to the 
other man ( who takes them up ). Br liffl (8 B E33p 375

order by Manu, out of whom only the aurasa and putrifca are 
the cause of propagating the line. Just as oil is declared by 
the good to he a substitute (in sacrifices) in the absence of 
clarified butter, so the eleven kinds of soub in the absence of 
aurasa and putt-tha**® ( are admitted merely as substitutes and 
not the real thing ).' Although Yaj. U. 132 declares that each 
succeeding one out of the twelve kinds of sons takes the estate 
in the absence of eaoh preceding one and offers pmda to the 
deceased owner, yet the efficacy of the pindas offered by the 
several sons was deemed to differ very much. Manu leaves no 
room for doubt on this point when he says (IX. 161 ) 'a man 
desiring to oross beyond the gloom (of bad worlds, hells) through 
(or with the help of) bad sons (such as the ksetraja ) secures 
a result similar to what a person crossing ( a sheet of ) water 
in a leaking boat secures '. The idea is that secondary son* 
cannot confer the same spiritual benefit as the aur<m son can 
Medhatithi on Manu IX 166 and the D. M. explain this very 
dearly. An aurasa son confers the highest spiritual benefit. 
The substitute sons (as indicated by the very use of the word 
prahnidhi) confer a much less benefit. Even a man's widow 
aan perform his srSddba if he be sonless, but as Bhe 
could not offer the paruana iraddha her act was not deemed to 
be as efficaoious as a srsddha performed by a son." 39 Jaimini 
devotes several sutras to the subject of prabmdh ( a substitute) 
in VI 3. 13-41. The main conclusion established is that gene- 
rally speaking there can be no substitute as regards the dxmla 
(the deity to whioh a particular offering is directed by the Veda 
to be offered in a particular saorifioe), the fire (shavanlya 
and other consecrated fires), the mantra (which is to accompany 
a particular offering) and certain rites specifically prescribed 
to be done in a sacrifice (such as 'samidho yajati' nDarfa- 
pOnumfiMOand the svUmm ( the saorificer) OnJaimimYI,

3. 35 Sahara makes 1M0 it clear that in employing a pmttmdhi 
the vedio rite becomes deficient and does not yield the full 
reward of the religious act. The Satyasadha Sr S. Ill 1. 
asserts 12 * 1 that there can be no substitute for the sacrifices the 
wife, the son, the place, time &c. (prescribed by the Vedio texts 
for any rite) Therefore it is clear that there was difference of 
view among very ancient writers about the spiritual benefit to 
he derived from substitute sons. The natural human tendency 
to simplify matters and water down strict injunctions prevailed 
and it began to be thought that even subsidiary sons conferred 
some spiritual benefit ( though not as much as the aurasa son ) 
For about two thousand years the ksetraja and other sons have 
been prohibited by the smrtis. For example, Br states that 
Manu first describes the procedure of niyoga and then forbids it, 
that it is impossible to practise niyoga in the diiSpara and hah 
ages owing to the deterioration in man's knowledge and topers 
( vide H. of Dh vol. n. p. 603 n. 1418 for the quotation ). The 
passage from Saunaka forbidding sons other than aurasa and 
daUaka in the Kali age quoted by Apararka and others has been 
cited above ( n. 1131 ). 

A few remarks will be made on each of the several sons. 

Aurasa. Baud. Dh. S. n. 2. 14, Manu IX. 166, Vas 17. 13, 
Visnu Dh. S. 15 2, Kaut. BX 7 and others define the aurasa as 
the son procreated by a man himself from his wife married 
aoc. to sacramental forms prescribed by the sastra From Ap 
(quoted above in n. 1227 ) and Baud it follows that the aurasa 
is only the son procreated on a wife of the same varna as that 
of the husband ; but this was the purists* view. Others including

such medieval works as the Mit. ( on Taj H. 133 ), the PSrijata 
and Apararka hold that even the son procreated on a wife 
married in the anuloma order 1242 ( e. g. the son of a brahmana 
from a ksatriya wife or of a ksatriya from a vaisya caste wife ) 
was also aurasa The exception was the son of a brahmana 
from a sudra wife, who was called saudra or parasava and 
distinguished from the technical aurasa. From the definition 
of aurasa given by all smrti writers ( and the dicta of such 
commentaries as the Mit ) it follows that in order to be an 
aurasa the procreation and the birth of the son must both be 
after the marriage But the Privy Council held long ago in 
Pedda Amend v Zemindar of Marungpun (1 L A. 282, 293) 
that procreation after marriage is not distinctly necessary for 
legitimacy as a son even according to the ancient texts, that 
to hold so would be an inconvenient doctrine and that the 
Hindu Law is the same in that respect as the English Law. 1243 

From the times of the Rgveda people prayed for the birth 
of an auinsa son and did not like to adopt the son of another,

In modern times the courts generally recognize only two 
kinds of sons, viz aurasa and dattaka, the other kinds-of sons 
being held to be long since obsolete. Vide Nagiwias v. Backoo

in modern timeB in certain provinces only, viz. the krtrSma in 
Mithila (modern Tirhoot) and the putrikaputra among the 
Nambudri brahmanas of Malabar, both of which will be dealt

Kaut 1H 7, Yaj. n. 128, Manu IX. 134 declare the putrika or

a brotherless maiden (after marriage) comes back to her 
paternal line for continuing that line and for offering pnnjas 
( to her paternal ancestors ) and does not go to ier husband's

brotherless maidens married and to- the fact of their remaining

when married, bar the way to the continuance of the family 
of their husbands and to offering of pindas ( through their son ), 
bo are these red arteries &c. Yaska ( Nirukta JUL 4 ) relies for 
the appointment of a brotherless daughter as a son upon 
another very obscure verse of the $g. (111. 31. 1)° 16 'the 
husband declares ( or promises ) that the father may regard (the 
daughter's son) as his son's son '. The Nirukta «» (HL 5) quotes 
a Vedio text * one should not marry a brotherless (girl), for

prohibits marriage with a brotherless maiden and also declares 
that such a girl becomes a son to her father. The brotherless 
maiden is appointed as a son by express agreement, bnt accord' 
ing to Gautama 28. 17 the opinion of one school ( which he does 
not approve ) waB that a brotherless girl became a putrikS by 
the mere unilateral intention of the father and therefore one 
should not marry a brotherless maiden for fear that the father

commendation not to marry a brotherless maiden continued

-provided the father was well- off. Mann IX. 140 states that the

aware of the prevalence of the putrikaputra in Malabar. 

Ksetraja This kind of son arose from the practice of 
niyoga. The origin of this practice and the limitations under 
which it was allowed have been dealt with at length in H. of 
Dh. vol. II pp 599-607. One matter not mentioned therein is 
this that the BrahmapurSna states that ksetraja sons were very 
common among ksatriyas since they had no progeny either 
because they were cursed (by sages for their misdeeds) or 
- because they were constantly engaged in war. 12W The Baud. - 
Dh. S. 1L 2. 2L-23 and Kau^ IIL 7 declare the ksetraja to be" 
the Bon of two fathers, to have two golras and to offer pindas 
to both fathers ( provided there is no aurasa son born subse- 
quently ) and to take taeir wealth and that in offering each 
pinda they have to associate it with two names l2S0 It is to be 
noted that the Mit. on Yaj. II. 127 introduces the ksetraja as 
dvyamusyayana, although that word, as will be seen later on, 
has another significance also The Madanaparijata (p. 651) also 
regards ksetraja and dvyamusyayana as synonyms. The 
YivadatlUdava ( folio 182) states that the dvyamusyayana and 
sons of intercaste marriages being forbidden in Kali it does 
not enter into any discussion about the rules of allotting shares 
to them.

Dattdka. This will be dealt with separately later on. 

Krtrima — ( or krta, as in Nar. dayabhaga 46 ). According to 
Manu IX 169, Yaj. IL 131, Baud. Dh. S II. 2 25 and 
the Mit. and other works a krtrima is a person (of the same 
caste as the adopter) who has no parents and who is adopted 
with his own consent by the tempting offer of wealth He is 
distinguished from the daltdlca by the fact that he is not given 
by the father or mother and by the fact that his own consent is 
necessary ( so that he must be major according to the ancient 
Hindu Law ). Such a son is recognized in modern times only 
in Mithila ( Tirhoot ) and the adjoining districts and among the 
Nambudri brahmanas of Malabar ( as held in Vasudevan v 
Secretaiy of State 11 Mad. 157). Considerable case law existB 
about the krtrima adoption, for which Mulla's Hindu Law 
pp 563-564 ( 9th ed ) and Mayne's Hindu law (lOthed.) pp 
293-294 may be consulted. 

Gudltaja. There is probably a reference to such a son in 
the Rg. II 29. 1 12 » *OI Adityas, that uphold the moral law, 
that are always active, keep away from me sin as a woman 
giving birth to a child in secret ( removes it ) '. 

Kantna. This word is derived from the word 'kanys' 
(a maiden). Panini IV. 1 116 (kanyayah kanhia ca) derives 
the word in the sense of " child of a maiden " and the Zasiks 
gives Kama and Vyasa as instances of kSnlna sons The word 
kanlna occurs in the Atharvaveda V. 5. 8 and kumuriputra occurs 
in 'the Vajasaneyasamhita 30. 6. Nar. ( dayabhaga 17 ) «» sayB 
that the kanlna, sahodha and gudhaj'a are the sons of the man 
who marries the mother of these and they take the wealth of the 
husband of their mother. The Parijata ( q by V. B. p. 56a i ) 
states that the kanlna and Bahodha become the sons of their 
mother's father if the latter is sonless, but if he has a son then 
they become the sons of the husband of their mother and u 
both have no sons then they become the sons of both

CHAPTER XXVIir 
DATTAKA ( adopted son ) 

No branch of Hindu Law in modern times has been so 
fruitful in litigation as adoption. There are instances, where, 
fifty years after a point in the law of adoption was deemed 
to have been settled by a Full Bench decision, the Privy 
Council intervened and overruled the Full Bench decision 
in spite of its usual practice to follow the rule of staie decisis. 
The medieval digests are full of varying interpretations of the 
same smrti texts and the law of adoption differs from province 
to province according to the authoritative medieval works and 
modern case law. Voluminous works like those of Shastri 
Golapcbandra Sarkar and of Mr. Kapur have been written on 
the subject of adoption in all its details. There is so much 
bewildering confusion and so much case law on the several 
aspects of adoption that it is only legislation that can resolve 
the tangled skein of the modern law of adoption. In this section 
an attempt will be made to present the law of adoption as 
evolved by the smrtis and medieval works and only some im- 
portant cases bearing in varioua ways on the ancient law will 
be cited. 

It has been shown above (pp. 641,657) how even in the times 
of the Rgveda the son of the body was eagerly sought for and how 
the adoption of another man's son was declared to be not worthy 
of being thought of. Even so late an author as Sukra (11 31 ) 
says that the adopted and other secondary sons should never he 
thought as one's sons, since on seeing a rich man they desire to be 
adooted 12 »«. Yet Vedic Literature contains some references to 
adopted sons. In the Tai S. VII. 1 8 1 we come across the 
the story of Atri« s » who gave an only son in adoption to 
AuTva in these words : ' Atri gave his son in adoption to Aum 



S3. X. 7 and OT». «»• « *• 16_26 - 



HI} Ancient text* o» adoption 663: 

who desired Ao have a son. He (Atri), having become empty 
taa it were, by giving away his only son), thought himself to 
be destitute of strength, to he weak and worn out (lit. Btale), 
He-(Atri) saw this catV/ratra C a sacrifice of that name lasting 
for four days ). Ha made preparations for it and performed that 
sacrifice. Then he had four valiant Bons born to him, a good 
Hotr, a good Udgatr, a good. Adhvaryu and a good sabhcya 
(skilful speaker in an assembly )'. The story of Sunabsepa in 
the Ait. Br. (33 ) shows that Visvamitra, though he had already 
one hundred and one sons, adopted Sunabsepa under the name 
DevaT&ta, with the consent of his fifty-one sons (wiihMadbu- 
cchandas 1253 at their head ), though the elder 50 sons disobeyed 
their father. It must be supposed that the later rule allowing 
only a sonless man to adopt did not apply to Yisvamitra. 

The sutras and Bmrtie contain hardly anything about the 
dattaka except his name (among the 12 kinds of sons) or the 
definition, as in Baud. Dh. S. II 2. 24, Mann IX 168, Yaj. 31. 130, 
VisnuDh.S 15 18-19, Nar. (dayabhaga 46) TheVas Dh,S is an 
exception. It not only gives a definition ( in 17 28-29 ), but iB 
one of the earliest smrti texts to dilate on the rules about 
adoption (in 15. 1-9). "What it says may h3 sat forth in one 
place. "Man produced from seed and blood owes his birth to 
his mother and father. (Hence) the mother and father have 
power to give, to sell or to abandon him. But one (should not 
give or accept an only son, for, he is required to continue the 
line of his ancestors. A woman should neither give nor receive 
a son (in adoption) except with the permission of her husband. 
One about to take a eon in adoption should, after having invi- 
ted his kinsmen, having informed the ruler (of the intended 
adoption) and having performed in the middle part of his house 
a homo, with the wjSfcrfcs, take only him who is closely related 
and who is a kinsman not remote ( in habitation and speech ) 
If a doubt arises (as to the family of the person to be adopted) 
he (the person desiring to adopt) should treat one whose 
kinsmen are in a remote place as if he were a sudra; for it is 
declared (in the Brahmana or Vedic works) ' by means of one 
(eon, aurasa or adopted) he (the adopter) saves many' If 
after a son is taken ( in adoption ), an aurasa is born (to the 
adopter) the adopted son s hall he the recipient of a fourth

the Privy Council as of the highest authority in matters of 
adoption. In Collector of Madura v. Afootoo 12 Moo. L A. 
397 at p. 437 the P. 0. observe : ' Of the DattakamimarhBa of 
Nanda Fandita and the Dattaka. Candrika of Devanna Bhatta, 
two treatises on the particular euhjeot of adoption, Sir William 
Maonaghten says that they are respected all over India ; hut 
that when they differ the doctrine of the latter is adhered to in 
Bengal and by the southern Jurists, while the former is said to 
he the infallible guide in the provinces of Mithila and Benares*. 
But Jolly (T. L. L. p. 166) gives a far more correct estimate 
of the value of the D. M. when he says ' It is simply a mis- 
fortune that so much authority should have been attributed in 
the courts all over India to such a treatise as Nanda Pandita's 
Mimamsa which abounds more in fanciful distinctions than 
perhaps any other work on adoption and it is high time that 
the numerous other treatises on adoption should he thoroughly 
examined and given their due weight*. In Bhagwan v. Bhaoimn 
26 1 A 153 at p. 161 the P. 0. observe ' To call it (the Dattaka- 
numamsa ) infallible is too strong an expression and the esti- 
mates of Sutherland and of West and Buhler seem nearer the 
true mark; but it is clear that both works must he acoepted as 
bearing high authority for so long a time that they have be- 
come embedded in the general law '. Yet even these works have 
been set at naught and departed from by Courts in India on 
many points as will appear in the sequel. 

The principal matters to be discussed under adoption are: 
object of adoption, persons that may legally take in adoption, 
persons that may give in adoption, persons that may be taken 
m adoption, the requisites and ceremonies of adoption and the 
results of adoption.

always secure a substitute for a son with all possible effort for

Nagpur High Court in Sharadaekandra v. Shantabai (I L. E 1944

High Court ate not oonvinoing and the judges seem to be

Though it may be conceded that in the majority of cases the object of the 
adopter is religions, the object of the giver and of the fer$on adapted ( if he 
is grown up) is far from religious The main object of the latter two at 
least in modern times is to secure .wealth without effort and hardly any reli- 
gions motives enter into their minds No one gives a son in adoption to a 
poor man, though a poor man has a soul to save as much ss a rich mas. 
Besides in adoption by widows, their motive is very often far from religions. 
They often adopt out of pique against their husband's brothers or nephews 
and for benefiting themselves monetarily by making agreements with the 
adopted sons to share the property with them,

HI] Who may adopt a son 667 

just like an aurasa eon except in a few well defined cases. 
It cannot be supposed that the P. O. knew all the texts of the 
mbandhas dealing with adoption. Though the Bombay High 
Court held in Pvkdabai v. Mahadu 33 Bom. 107 that a mother 
did not by her remarriage forfeit her right to give in adoption 
her son by the first husband, that decision was subsequently 
overruled in Fakirappa v. Savttretva 23 Bom. L R. 482 (F B.) 
which deoided that after remarriage a widow has no power to 
give in adoption her son by the first husband. The same High 
Court held in Shamstng v Sluxntabai (25 Bom. 551) that a Hindu 
father, who, after the birth of a son, became a convert to the 
Moslem faith, did not by reason of his conversion lose his 
power of giving his son, who remained a Hindu, in adoption 
though the physical act of giving in adoption, being accom- 
panied by religious ceremonies, may have to be delegated by 
him to a Hindu. This decision was based on the GaBte Dis- 
abilities Removal Act of 1851 (for whioh see above p. 547, 
«, 1021 ). This decision is against the spirit of the ancient 
Hindu Law. 

What persons may adopt a son. — Every male Hindu, who is 
Of sound mind and has attained the age of discretion though he 
may be a minor according to the Indian Majority Act (HI of 
1875 ), can take a son in adoption provided he has no boh, 
grandsonor great-grandson, natural or adopted, living at the time 
of adoption The word 'aputrena' in the verse of Atri { quoted 
above in n. 1231) is explained by the D. M. as meaning "6° 
one who had no son at all or whose son is dead and as in. 
eluding the grandson and great-grandson. It would appear 
from a Bombay decision that even if a Hindu has a son, grand- 
son or great-grandson disqualified from inheriting on the 
grounds mentioned above he cannot adopt (vide Bharmappa v 
Ujjangauda 46 Bom. 455). In the Dattasiddhantamanjarl of 
Bslakrsna (folio lib) it is stated that if the aurasa son of a 
person is congenially blind, dumb or deaf he can take a boy 
in adoption. In Knshnaji v. Raghavendra LL.B. (1942) Bom. 
492 it has been held, rel ying upon 46 Bom. 455, that a widow

HI] Interpretations of Vasistlia's text 669 

idea is that the permission (amjaana) of the husband is not 
required to be given just at the time of the adoption and that 
it may be given long before the actual adoption. (3) In 
Madras a widow may also adopt without 1263 her husband's 
authority, provided she secures the consent of the father-in-law 
or (if the latter be dead) of all the co-parceners of the husband, 
if her husband died as a member of a joint family, and if the 
husband was separate at the time of his death, then the consent 
of the father-in-law or (if he were dead) of a substantial majo- 
rity of her husband's nearest sapindas. In this view the word 
' of the husband' ( in Vasistha) is taken as only illustrative and 
not literally. (4) The Vyavaharamayukha, 1264 the Nirnaya- 
sindhu, the Samskarakaustubha, the Dharmasindhu, that are 
regarded as authoritative in Bombay and Western India, hold that 
the passage of Vasistha refers only to a wife whose husband is 
alive and that a widow may adopt without the husband's autho- 
rity. According to this school the husband's authority to adopt 
is always to be presumed, unless he has prohibited his widow 
expressly or by necessary implication from adopting. The D. C. 
appeals to the general maxim 'another's (or the opponent's) view 
if not dissented from may be taken as having been approved '. 

1263 In Balsubratnanya v M Subbayya L. R 65 I. A. 93 at p. 99 
the Privy Council say . ' their Lordships are not laying down that the 
requisite authority must necessarily be express but they agree with the 
District Judge that in order to constitute an implied authority there must 
be circumstantial evidence of a cogent character '. Vide ZVie Collector of 
Madura v. Mootoo 12 Moo. I. A. 397 pp. 435-36 where three of these four 
interpretations are pointed out.

670 History of Dharmaiastra [ Vol. 

There is a large volume of case law about the construction 
of the authority to adopt, about the rights of co-widows in the 
matter of adoption, about the limits of a widow's power, which 
are deemed to be outside the purview of this work. 

As regards the power of a widow to adopt in the Bombay 
sohool, when her husband was joint at the time of his deaths 
the case law has fluctuated from time to time Only a few 
cases may he referred to here. In Bamji v. G-hamau 6 Bom. 
498 (F. B.) a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court held that a 
widow, whose husband was a member of a joint family at the 
time of his death, could not adopt when she has not the 
authority of her hushand or the consent of the husband's un- 
divided coparceners. After this deoision had stood for 50 years 
the Privy Council held in Bhimabai v. Gurumahqouda™* 
L. B 60 1 A. p. 25 that the Full Bench decision had already 
been overruled in Yadao v. Namdeo { 48 1. A 513 ) and that a 
Hindu widow can adopt without the consent of her huBband'B 



1265. In Bhimabal s case the Privy Council purpoit to follow the 
case of Rakhmabat v. Radhabat S Bom H. C. R (A C. J ) p 181. Ent 
in that case the husband was separate at the time of his death The P C. 
however point out that in Yadao v Namdeo (48 1 A 513 at p. 529) it 
was said that the decision in Rakhmabai's case was not based on the fact 
that the husband was separate at his death or on the fact that the widow 
when she made the adoption had the estate vested in her and it was held 
that that decis.on was equally applicable where the husband was jomt 
Apart from the fact that the decsion of the P. C is opposed to the general 
■utunent of Hindu society at present, w.th the greatest respect two 
criticisms have to be offered against the decision in Bhimabai a caw The

co-parceners, when the husband was a member of a joint family 
at the time of his death. This decision was carried further by 
Amarendra's oase ( 60 L A. 242 ) by holding that when a widow, 
who had authority to adopt, adopted even after the estate had 
devolved on a male collateral heir such adopted son would 
take the estate and deprive the heir of it. As any widow was 
held to be able to adopt in Bombay without anybody's consent, 
hundreds of adoptions have taken place, which came and are 
coming before the courts. Another Full Bench case held that 
when a Hindu coparcenary came to an end on the death of the 
last surviving coparcener and the family property became 
vested in his heir, a subsequent adoption by the widow of a 
predeceased coparcener was valid, but it did not revive the 
coparcenary nor did it vest the property of the former co- 
parcenary in the adopted Bon ( Balu v. Laltoo I. L. R. 1937 
Bom. 508 ). "When a co-parcenary was broken up by partition 
-mong the members, it was held 1266 that the widow of a co- 
parcener who died long before the partition cannot make a 
valid adoption and reliance was placed on a passage of the 
Vlramitrodaya ( quoted below ). 12fi7 

But these decisions have been dissented from in Bajirao v. 
Bamknshm I. L. R. (1941) Nagpur 707 and in K. It. Sankarhngam 
Pdlai v. Veluchami Ptllai I. L. R (1943) Mad. 309 ( F. B. ), where 
it^ has been laid down that when the surviving coparceners of a 
joint Hindu family were in possession of the joint family 
properties which they obtained in a partition among themselves 
after the death of a coparcener and subsequent to the partition 
a valid adoption was made to the deceased coparcener by his 
widow the adopted son was' entitled to reopen the partition. 
They rely by way of analogy on the provisions of Yaj that the 
posthumous son can reopen a partition already made and 
also on that of the disqualified heir when the disqualification is 
removed and on the dicta in some cases that an adoption dates 
back to the date of the death of the adoptive father. But no 
smrti text and no digest has extended the exceptional rules 
about the posthumous son and the disqualified heir to a son

adopted after partition. Their reasoning as regards the Bombay 
cases is not satisfactory. It amounts to this that as between 
the separating co-parceners the coparcenary may be extinct 
but as to the subsequently adopted son it exists i. e. a co- 
parcenary is extinct and existing at the same time, which, 
to use no stronger expression, appears rather strange. Besides 
the general rule is (hat partition is made only once(Maira 
IX. 47 }. The cases of the posthumous son and of the disqualified 
heir are expressly provided by way of exceptions. The usual 
rule is that exceptions are to be strictly limited to the matters 
expressly stated and are not to be extended by analogy to cases 
not covered by the words of the exception and that other cases 
are governed by the general rule. It is a canon of interpreta- 
tion in Hindu Law that a special text forming an exception 
to a general text should be construed strictly and applied only 
to the oases clearly falling within it ( Gangu v. Chandrabhagdba% 
32 Bom. 275, 283, Hanmant v. Ganesh 43 Bom. 612,624). Further, 
a Hindu widow is not compelled to adopt at any particular 
time ; she may adopt at any time during her life. In Baje 
Vyanfcotrao v. Jayaoartlraa 4 Bom. H. C R ( A. J. ) 191 it is 
noticed that the widow an that case adopted 71 years after her 
husband's death. If the reasoning of the learned Judges of 
Nagpur and Madras is correct then when three or four genera- 
tions have succeeded to the separating coparceners, an adopted 
son can reopen the partition after three quarters of a century 
This result, to say the least, would be most unreasonable. The 
Nagpur High Court observes that every Hindu widow is a 
potential mother. This is a fiction which has been carried too far 
by that court and by the Privy Council A woman in the order 
of nature can hardly ever have an omasa son beyond the age oi 
fifty or so, but when a fiction is employed a woman tcan brmg

HI ] Criticism qf P. C. decisions 673 

must be some limit to the power of a widow to adopt or 
some conditions in which it would be contrary to tbe spirit 
of the doctrine to admit its continuance or inequitable 
in the face of other rights to allow it to take effect ( L. R. 60 
L A. 242 at p. 249 ). In Madana Molutna v. Purshatfiama L. R. 
45 LA. 156 the P. O. approving of Bamlcnshna v. Shamrao 
26 Bom. 526 ( ¥. B ) held that, when a man dies leaving a 
widow and a son and that son dies leaving his own son 
or a widow to continue the line by adoption, the power of 
the former widow comeB to an end and cannot be revived ; that 
is, they were prepared to hold that the grandmother succeed- 
ing to her grandson who died unmarried could not make a 
valid adoption and allowed the grandfather and bis ancestors 
to remain without the religious benefits that a son adopted 
by the grandmother would have conferred ( in spite of the 9th 
chapter of Manu on which they rely in Atnarendra's case ). 
According to the recent rulings any widow whose husband died 
a member of a joint Hindu family may adopt at any time even 
when the other members become separate and may remain 
separate for 50 years or more and yet a large slice of the estate 
may be taken away after several generations have succeeded, 
laboured and acquired a vast estate. Further, it is not clear 
how far the P. O. will go in their solicitude for the adopted son. 
Suppose three brothers separate and one of them sells the pro- 
perty that came to his share. If the partition is to be opened 
for the benefit of a son subsequently adopted by a predeceased 
member's widow, will the purchaser be affected or not {supposing 
the sale is within 12 years of the adoption)? Supposing that 
the last surviving member of a family dies leaving a married 
daughter and a predeceased son's widow and the daughter inhe- 
rits an absolute estate (as she does in Bombay) and remains 
in possession for 30 years, is it meant that a son thereafter 
adopted by the widowed daughter-in-law can divest an estate 
vested for thirty years in a married daughter who is not a mem- 
ber of the family at all after her marriage? The recent P.O. 
deCKionin-touSWw appears to indicate that whatever 
the length of fame the adopted son will oust a collateral to whom 
the estate may have gone by inheritance. Intending purchasers

then became a ksatriya. 12 " The courts accept the view of 
Kulluka and the rest. It is likely that courts may allow a

HI ] Adoption of eldest son 6T7 

The eldest son also should not be taken in adoption, since, 
astheMit.(on Yaj. IL 130) puts it, it is the eldest son alone 
who Is the foremost in serving the purposes of a son as regards 
his genetive father aco. to Manu IX. 106 which says ' a man 
becomes one haying a son (a father) by the mere faot of the- 
birth of his ( first) son and becomes free from the debt owed to

prepared) may equally be used instead of the surpa. But the object of the 
tatter half is not to assign a reason, but rather to praise and recommend the 
sarpa as the means of making the homa and so nothing but the sin-pa can be 
employed in making the offering. The Veda is the final authority in all 
matters pertaining to sacrifice ; it does not stand in need of giving reasons 
for its prescriptions but it may eulogise an act to induce people to perform 
it. Therefore in the hetuvan-mgadadhikarana Jatmim does not lay down 
( as thought by Mandlik and by the High Court in 14 All. 67, pp 73 , 84, 125) 
that when a text is supported by a clause containing words of reason, it 
should be regarded as merely recommendatory (and not obligatory), bat 
what Jaimini lays down is that clauses containing words generally meaning 
' reason * are to be construed as arthavadas ( praises ) of the obligatory rule 
contained in a previous clause. Mr. Mandlik says ( p 499 of his ' Hindu 
Law') 'It is a rule of the PurvamimSmsa that all texts supported by the 
assigning of a reason are to be deemed not as vtdhi but simply as arthtxoada 
(recommendatory). "When a text is treated as an arthavada it follows that 
it has no obligatory force whatever. Sabarasvamin constructs an adhi- 
karana on this head which he calls • hetuman-nigadadbikarana ■ (quoted in 
14 AH. 67 at p. 73). This is entirely wrong as shown above and the adhi- 
karana Is not called ■ hetuman etc » but ' hetuvan etc. \ Ace to Taimini's rule 
the words of Vas 15.3 • naikam putram ■ contain a vidhi (an obligatory 
rule), while the following clause containing the word -hi' (indicative of 
.V"^*" *' ?"*****• **™*" • is merely an arthavada, which praises 
the vidhi by emphasizing the importance of a son. Sarkar in his 'Mimamsa 
Rules' {pp. 175-176) correctly represents the meaning of Jaimini, though 
somewhat obscure language The decisions in 14 AU. 67 and 26 I A 113

thepifrs'. But, in modern times this rule is taken to be only 
recommendatory and the adoption of the eldest son is held valid 
as also that of an only son 1 " 8 . The V. Mayukha (p. 108) states: 
aeo. to the Mil the prohibition to give the eldest son affects 
only tne giver hut not the adopter and he criticizes the Mifc that 
Manu IX. 106 does not forbid the giving of the eldest son, but 
only provides that by the birth of the first son a man becomes 
free from debt (to pitrs). So the V. Mayukha goes a step fur- 
ther and holds that there is no prohibition at all either to give 
or take in adoption the eldest son, while the Mit., though it 
does not hold the adoption bad, seems to hold that the giver 
incurred blame. The Sam. K. p. 150 also does not allow the 
adoption of the eldest son. Two or more persons cannot adopt 
the same boy and if they do so the adoption by each iB invalid 12 ". 
The DvySmusyayana adoption, to be described later on, is an 
exception. 

The texts contain rules about preference in selecting a 
boy for adoption, when several are eligible The Mit. 1280 on 
Y&i H. 138 declares that the verse of Mann IX. 18£ stating 
that 'when out of several brothers who are sons of the same 
father one has a son all of them become, through that son per- 
sons having a son * does not provide that he becomes really the 
B on of all but it indicates that when a brother's son is avauawe

for adoption another boy should not be adopted. A similar 
explanation had been given by an ancient commentator Deva- 
svamin. The D. M., D. O. ( PP : 5-6 ) and Sam. K. p. 150 quote 
passages of Saunaka" 8 * and Sakala that a man should prefer 
a sapinda or a sagotra to one who is not a sapinda or of the 
same gotra. The D. M„ D. C, the Sam. K p. 150, the Dharma- 
sindhu recommend the following order: the full brothers son. 
then a sagotra sapinda, then a sapinda though not of the same 
gotra ( such as a boy from one's maternal uncle's line or a 
paternal aunt's descendant ), then one not a Bapinda though of 
the same gotra, then one who isneitber a Bapinda nor a sagotra. 
This order is purely recommendatory and an adoption in breach 
of it is quite valid. It has been recently held that an adoption 
is invalid if the boy adopted be congenitally and incurably 
deaf and dumb though not an idiot- Vide 8m endra v Blwlanath 
1 L. R. (1944) 1 Oal. 139 

As to the age of the boy to be adopted there is great diver- 
gence among the medieval writers which is also reflected in the 
case law. In this connection certain verses of the Kalikapurana 
assume 1288 great importance The V. Mayukha and the D. O

hold that the passage is of doubtful authenticity (as the verses 
are not found in several mss. ), while the D. M. and the Nirnaya- 
sindhu hold them to be genuine and the Sam K, pp. ( 169-172 ) 
after referring to these views states that those verses are opposed 
to what is stated in the Ait. Br. about Sunalsepa who was adopted 
by Visvamitra as a son even after upanayana. The verses are. 
'O King I that son, whose samskaras up to (including) the cufa 
( tonsure ) ceremony are performed with the gofcra of his 
( natural ) father, does not (i e. cannot) attain the status of the 
adopted son of another When the ceremonies of cuda and 
upanayana are performed under his own gotra (by the adoptive 
father) the dattaka and the other kinds become (recognised as) 
sons ( in the adoptive family); otherwise they are called dSsa 
(slave). After the fifth year the adopted' son and the rest can- 
not be (recognised as) sons. Having taken one who is five 
years old, one ( the adopter ) should first perform the putresh ', 
These verses state four propositions: (1) If all samskaras 
from jatakarma to cutfa (Le including it ) have been performed 
in the family of birth that boy oannot be adopted in another 
family ; (2) if a boy's cw#5 and other later ceremonies are per- 
formed in the family of adoption he is fully an adopted son; 
(3) a boy over five years of age cannot be adopted at all, (4) a 
boy whose cuda has been performed in the family of birth may 
be adopted up to five years, provided the rite called putresti 1253 
- is first performed in the adoptive family before any other cere- 
mony is performed on the adopted boy. The D. M. says that 
the best time for adoption is np to three years, then from three 
years to five is the next best ( gauw ) and that after five no 
boy can be adopted. The D O. ( p. 36 ) holds that a boy of the 
three higher classes can be adopted up to upanayana and that a 
sudra boy can be adopted till his marriage The Nirnaya- 
smdhu see ms to be of the same opinion The V. Ma3 T ukha"

and Sam. K. both hold that even a boy not of the same gotra 
may be taken in adoption after upanayana 01 after marriage 
and even when the person to be adopted has himself had a son. 
In Bengal, Benares" 85 and Bihar the courts hold that the boy 
•must be adopted before upanayana. The same rale holds good 
in Madras 1285 ; but there it is farther held that if the boy to be 
adopted is of the same gotra as the adopter, the adoption may be 
made after npanayana but before marriage. In Bombay a 
person may be adopted at any age, even after marriage and 
even after he has had children and he may be even older than 
the adopter. 1237 In the whole of India, a sudra may be adopted 
only before his marriage, but in the Bombay Presidency the 
adoption of a, married man and of one having even a child is 
allowed also among sudras 1288 .

682 History of Dharmainstra { Vol. 

Saunaka required that the boy to be adopted murf be 
puiracch8yavaha nes (one who bears resemblance to or is a reflec- 
tion of the aurasa eon). This has led to differing explanations 
by the commentators and contradictory decisions in the several 
Indian High Courts. The D. M. and D. G ( p 21 ) both explain 
that the resemblance consists in the possibility of being pro- 
created by the adopter himself by niyoga and the like. The 
meaning of the D. M. is : A brother's son or a sapinda's son 
or a sagotra's son can be adopted because the adopter could 
have procreated a son by the praotice of niyoga on the wife of a 
brother or a sapinda or a sagotra (according to the" rules of 
niyoga ) ; but he could not have done so as regards his mother, 
or grandmother, daughter or sister or his mother's sister. There- 
fore a man cannot adopt his own brother, paternal or maternal 
uncle, a daughter's son or a sister's son and the like One strange 
thing is that, though myoga had been forbidden for many 
centuries before the D. M., the author of it brings in the rules 
of the long obsolete practice of ■niyoga'* 39 * to find out who could 
or could not be adopted. But stranger things were to happBB 
Sutherland who translated both the D.M. and theD.C explained 
in his notes the word ' niyogadina ' as ' by such an appointment 
or marriage and the like'. Vide Stoke's Hindu Law Texts 
p. 590 ( DattakamlmSmsa, sec. V. plaaium 16. note ). There was 
no warrant for introducing the word"' marriage ' after ' niyoga' 
The rules of niyoga are different from those of marriage 
The judges most of whom were generally ignorant of Sanskrit and 
had yet to decide cases among Hindus according to Hindu Law 
as understood by them ( vide 36 I A. 113 at page 138 about the 
ignorance of Sanskrit among judges ) seized upon this explana- 
tion and evolved the curious rule that no one could be adopted 
whose mother the adopter could not have married in her maiden 
state (i. e the relationship has reference to a time pnar to

marriage ). This is still the lawin all Presidencies" 91 except 
Bombay. Although the T>. M. stated that the hoy to be adopted 
must be capable of being procreated by niyoga, at another place 
it remarks, after quoting verses of Saunaka 129 * and Sakala, that 
a boy of another gotra may be adopted except a daughter s son, 
a sister's son and a mother's sister's son. The Bombay High 
Court holds that any one may be adopted except these three 
(vide Ramcliandrav Gojpal 32 Bom 619, Walbai v. Beerbai 34 
Bom. 491 holding that a man cannot adopt his mother's sister's 
son, Bamkrtshna v Chimnaji 15 Bom. L. E 824 holding the 
adoption of father's sister's son valid ). Very strange results 
have followed from this viz. the Bombay High Court has 
upheld the validity of the adoption as a son by a man of his own 
half-brother ( vide Gajanan v Kashmath 39 Bom. 410), of his own 
maternal uncle's son, and the adoption by a widow of her deceased 
husband's son-in-law ( vide Stlabai v. Parvatrbai 47 Bom 35 ). It 
should be noted that the Dvaifcanirnaya or Dharmadvaitanir- 
naya 1W3 ( of Sankarabhatta, father of NJlakantha ) and the V. 
Mayukha both hold after a very abstruse reasoning based on 
several Mlmamsa rules, that men of the three higher classes may

adopt a daughter's son, a gisters's Bon or a mother's sister's son and 
that a sudra must adopt one of these if available in preference 
to any one else. ^ The Bombay High Court follows the inter- 
pretation of Saunaka's verse given by Nandapandita in 
preference to Nllakantha's, but in its ' tDrn disregards the 
authority of Nandapandita who forbade the adoption of a 
brother or uncle. It would have been far better if it' had 
generally brushed aside everywhere the dicta of Nanda- 
pandita and preferred the interpretation of the Mayukha. 
Popular sentiment is in favour ' of the daughter's son 
or sister's son being adopted, as they are the nearest and often 
the dearest relations, and yet the High Court shuts the 
• door against them, while it opens it ajar for the adoption of 
a brother or maternal uncle or his son or one's own daughter's 
husband, whioh appears absurd to people. Besides the High 
Courts have recognised the adoption even of a daughter's 
son 12 ' 1 on the ground of custom by Desastha smarta brahmanas 
in the Dharwar District (vide Sundrdbai v Hanmant 56 Bom. 
298 ), by Telugu brahmanas ( Visivasurwlma v. Somasundwra 
43 Mad. 876 ). Sudras can adopt a daughter's or sister's or 
mother's sister's son all over India. The D. M. went so far as 
to say that a widow could not adopt her brother's son. 1295 The 
D. M. ignored. the fact that the widow ,adopts to her husband 
I and not to herself ) who bore no relation to his wife's brother's 
ivife and who could have himself adopted that son. The Bombay 
High Court and the Privy Council have discarded this absurd 
proposition of the D. M Pannalal in ' Eumaun Local customs 

1294 It may be noted that the question of the adoption of the daugh- 
ter's son cropped up even in the times of the Peshwas. In 'Selections from 
Peshwa's Records' vol 43 No 146 pp 116-117 the opinion of KSmsastn,

notes that in that part of India a daughter's or a sister's son 
maybe adopted (p. 14 para 56). It has been recently held that 
the adoption of the illegitimate son of a woman even among 
sudras is invalid. Vide Apya v. Ramakka LL. R. (1941) Bom. 
350. This was relied upon for holding that a woman cannot 
give in adoption an illegitimate son among Lingayats in 
Ttrkangauda v. Shimppa A.LB (1944) Bom. 40. 

It is now necessary to say a few words about the duyamu- 
symicma. A daltakj is of two kinds 1296 , lcevala (simple or 
ordinary) and duyamusyuyava ( the son of two fathers). When 
a man gives his only son in adoption'to another under an agree- 
ment that he is to be considered as the Bon of both the natural 
father {janalca or janalta-pitr) and of the adoptive father 
(palalca), the son so given is called dvyamusyayana. The 
Bombay High Court has held that in order to constitute a 
dvyamusyayana an express agreement as stated above must be 
proved even when one brother adopts the only son of another 1297 , 
A dvyamusyayana inherits both in the natural and adoptive 
families. The word dvyamusyayana was employed in some of

the smrtis as applicable to all such sons as the dattaka, krlta 18 ' 
The V. Mayukha quotes a prose passage from Katyayana 
( which is attributed to Paithlnasi in D. ) and the 
V. Mayukha, D M. and D C. all quote a verse ( which is 
ascribed to Pravaradhyaya by the first and to Parijnta by the 
D. M. ) that supports this. The D. M and D C. both quote 
two sufcras of Satyasadha and Sahara's gloss (bhu$ya) thereon 
in which the ksetiaja is called ndifa dvyamitst/uyaxta and 
the dattaka and others are called amtya dvyamusyayana Yaj 
11 127 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 21 provide that a ksetraja is the 
son of both the begetter and of the husband of the wife on whom 
the .sou is procreated. Therefore such a son is called mlya 
dvyamusyayana ( because he is always the son of two fathers). 
When the ksetraja became obsolete and forbidden, the only 
dvyamusyayana was an only son taken in adoption with a 
stipulation as described above. About the dattaka Manu IX. 142 
states the general rule that the dattaka loses the gotra of his 
genetive father and assumes that of the' adopter. But a dattaka 
belonged to two gotras according to some, if his samskfiras up 
to ixaila wore performed in his natural family and the samskara 
of upanayana and those that follow were performed in to 
adoptive family/ Therefore it was not a general proposition 
that a dattaka .always belonged to two gotras. If all the 
samskaras from jBtakmma were performed by the adopter, 
then the dattaka would take the gotra of the adopter alone 
Hence the sons called dattaka and 'the bought' were styled amtw 
dvyamusyayanas (who were not in all cases dvysmusyayonos } 
TheD M. states this 12W twofold division of dvyamusyayanas 
and employs the words nttuautt or m/t/a and amtuat,al or am Ua

to denote the two varieties and restricts the former only to a 
son adopted with a stipulation as stated above. The ksetraja 
became quite obsolete many centuries ago and the courts have held 
that the anitya dvyamusyayana is also now obsolete 130 ° It is 
now held that every adoption is presumed to be in the simple 
( kevala ) form, unless a stipulation that the boy will be the 
son of both is proved ( when it will be a dvyamusyayana 
adoption ). 

When a man is adopted in the dvyamusyayana form, his 
son born after such adoption has been held to inherit as grand- 
son to the adoptive father, if the • dvyamusyayana son died

Ceremonies of Adoption.— The most essential ingredient in 
adoption is the giving of the boy by the natural father and the 
taking of the boy by the adopter with the intention to transfer 
the boy to the family of the adopter. Another requisite {in 
some oases ) is the homa called dattahoma* 3 ** which as described 
by Saunaka and Baud, is given 1302 in the Appendix. It is not 
necessary that the dattahoma must be performed immediately 
after the giving and taking, but it may be performed later and 
its performance may be' delegated to others when the giver or 
taker is a widow or a sudra or is ill &c. Although in Vedic 
times women composed hymns and although Harlta and Yama 
stated that woman had the upanayana performed on them and 
could study the Veda (H. Db. vol. H pp. 293-295 ), in later times 
it was held that women could not study the Veda, could not 
repeat Vedic mantras and therefore could not perform any 
homa (including daUahoma). Therefore some writers said that 
a widow could not adopt at all, while others like the V. MayC 
kha said that women are to be assimilated to sfidras and so 
just as a sudra can get the dattahoma performed through a 
brahmana, so a widow, though she cannot herself engage in 
homa may employ a brahmana to perform the dattahoma

position of women), and note 1362 above and V. Mayukha 
quoted below. 1303 It has been held that the datlahoma is 
not 13 * 1 necessary among twice-born classes if the boy to be 
adopted belongs to, the same gotra as that of the adoptive father. 
Jolly ( in T. L L. p. 160 ) states that the Dattakadarpana refers 
to a text of Yama from the Sarasvatlvilasa to the effect that homa 
is not absolutely essential in all cases. From Colebrooke's Digest 
V. 4 CCLXXHI it appears that Jagannatha held the same view 
The Dbarmasindhu remarks that in certain countries an adop- 
tion of a sagotra sapinda boy can be validly effected with the 
mere assent of the giver and adopter without Vedic ceremonies 
There is a good deal of conflict in the case law on this point, which 
is passed over Among sudras no homa is necessary. The 
ceremony of adoption as described by Baud, gr sesasutra II 6 
4-9 ( which is probably the oldest on record and which was the 
one to be followed ,by the Taittirfyas or followers of the Black 
Yajurveda, according to D. M., Sam K. p. 177 and the Dharma 
sindhu p. 161 ) is as follows • When about to take ( in adoption) 
the adopter makes ready (or collects) the following viz two 
pieces of cloth, two ear-rings, a finger ring, an acarya ( officiat- 
ing priest) who is well versed m the Veda, a bundle of kuSa 
grass, fuel sticks of palasa (Butea Srondosa). Then m the 
midst of invited relatives, after informing the ruler, he seraa 
food to.brahmanas in the assembly hall or m the middle of tho 
house. He (the adopter) makes (the brahmanas) pronounce 
the benedictions 'May the day be, auspicious' May you fare 
welll May there be prosperity!' and performs the acts (usual 
inallhomas) from drawing lines on the altar up to carrying 
forward the Pranlta Water. .Vide H of Dh. vol H pp 309-312 for

presenee of the giver and begs of him ' give me your eon '. The 
other one (the giver) says 'I give'. He (adopter) then take* 
hold of the boy with the words 'I accept thee for the continuity 
(of my family)'. Then he decks (the boy) with the pieces of 
cloth, the ear-rings, the finger ring and performs the acts from 
laying fuel etioks round the altar up to the offering of oblations 
into fire ; he offers boiled rice into fire with the mantra 'yastva 
hida' (3Jg. V. 4. 10 or Tai. S. I. 4. 46 1) as a put onumlcyn 13 ° 3 
(prayer of invitation) and with the mantra 'yasmai tvam 
sukrte' ( Rg. V 4. 11, Tai. S. I. 4. 46. 1 ) as a yajtja ( prayer of 
worship or offering ). Then having offered oblations of clarified 
butter with the vyahrtis 1306 he performs the acts from the offe- 
ring to Agni Svistakrt down to the giving of the cow and pre- 
sents. He (the adopter) gives as daksina (fee) to the priest 
these very pieces of cloth and rings (with which the boy was 
decked ). 

The procedure laid down by Saunaka, who appears to be 
much later than Baud., is somewhat different ( though there is 
a good deal common to both ) and is meant for the students of the 
Rgyeda (aco to Sam. K. p. 175 ). A few salient points may be 
noted. The adopter should fast the previous day, he should 
offer madhtiparka to the officiating priest, should perform all 
the details from the placing of fuel sticks -on the fire up to the 
purification of clarified butter with the blades of kusa grass 
The giver recites (when begged) the five verses beginning with 
ye yajnena' (Rg X 62 1-5) and the adopter holds the boy with 
both hands while repeating the mantra * devasya tva ' ( Asv gr

of the body (aurasa) except in a few well defined oases. The 
basic test on this point is that of Manu 1307 IX. 142 which may 
ba lifcarally rendered as follows : 'The son given should not take 
the gotra (the family name) and the wealth of, his natural father; 
the pinda (the cake of boiled rice offered to deceased ancestors in 
sraddhas ) follows the gotra and the wealth ( i e. is invariably 
concomitant with them); of him who gives (his son in adoption) 
the suadha (obsequial rites) ceases (sofar as that son is concerned)'. 
The preceding verse (Manu IX. 141) states that the adopted 
son takes the wealth of his adoptive father and all that this 
verse says is that, after adoption, the son given in adoption 
does not take the name of his natural father and has no right 
in the wealth that then is the natural father's and that he does 
not perform the obsequial and sraddha rites for his natural 
father. But from this verse a learned Hindu Judge derived 
the sweeping proposition that 'the theory of adoption depends 
upon the principle of a complete severance of the child adopted 
from the family in which he is born, both in respect tothe 
paternal and maternal line, and his complete substitution into 
the adopter's family as if he were born in it'. There is no 
warrant for the idea of complete severance emphasized here. 
This dictum was followed in many cases and was accepted by 
the Privy Council" 08 . Another great Judge went s o far as to

say that 'an absolute adoption appears to operate as birth of 
the hoy in the family of adoption and as civil death xn the 
family of hirth, having regard to the legal consequences that 
are incidents of such adoption' »». But then the P. C felt 
that matters were being carried too far and administered the 
warning 1310 that "As has been more than once observed the 
expressions ' civilly dead or as if he had never been born in the 
family' are not for all purposes correct or logically applicable 
but they are complimentary to the terra 'new birth'." We 
have to see what construction was put upon the verse of Manu 
by authoritative digests. The V. Mayukha explains Manu IX. 
143 and arrives at the conclusion that the four words gdra, 
riMa, pinda and soadlta are not to be taken literally but they are 
only used to indicate all those consequences only in relation to 
the natural father and the like that are brought about by their 
connection with the pinda and the verse of Manu conveys the 
cessation of all those consequences only. It further adds that 
the eon on being given away in adoption ceases to have similar 
relationship to his brother, paternal uncle ( in the family of 
birth). It Bhould be noted that the V. Mayukha does wo* say 
that the son given away is dead to the family of birth or ceases 
to have any connection whatever with the members of the 
family of birth, but restricts the cessation of relation to the 
offering of pinda and the taking of the estate after he is 
adopted. The D. M. quotes 1311 the Sm. C. ( IL 289 ) and holds 
that by the gift the adopted son ceases to have the same gotra 
as the, giver. The D. C. ( pp 23-24 ) states 1312 the same proposi- 
tion, without naming the Sm. C. The learned Judges who had 
to decide cases of adoption, even if they knew Sanskrit, do not 
generally appear to have consulted authoritative works other 
than the few that had been translated and were quite unaware as

to whether even the cessation of the pinda and goto and of the 
right to wealth when a son was given away was so universally 
accepted by the leading Dharmasaetra works as they thought 
The Sarasvatlvilasa (p. 394) quotes a text of Visnu 1 ^ that even 
the adopted son should perform the obsequial rites of the natural 
father and explains that Manu IX. 142 applies when the natural 
father has no issue at the time of his death. Kudraskanda on 
Khadira gr. ID, 5. 16 says the same. Kamalakara, the author 
of the Nirnayasindhu 1314 and a first cousin and contemporary 
of Nilakantha expressly states that Manu IX. 143 only applies 
when the natural father haB a son or sons (other than the one 
given away) and quotes Katyayana and Laugaksi cited in the 
Pravaramafijarl (p. 146) in support. The Dharmasindhu 1315 
also says that when a boy of another gotra is adopted after hjs 
upanayana is performed in the family of birth or when only 
the upanayana is performed by the adoptive father, the adopted 
boy should repeat both gotras at the time of bowing at the feet 
of elders or in srSddha and .other rites; but when all the cere- 
monies including the ouda are performed by the adoptive- 
father then the adopted boy has only one gotra ( viz. that of 
the adopter ). 

The plain meaning of the verse of Manu (IX 142) is that 
when a man gives away his son in adoption, then that son is 
transferred into another family, does not perform the sT&ddha 
and similar rites for the giver and cannot claim to take the 
wealth of his natural father as a son on the father's death 
or demand a partition from his father. The other son or'sont

of the giver are to perform the sraddhas for the father and to 
succeed to the family wealth. Bat this verse has been twisted 
by some High Court decisions to yield another rule. Suppose 
A., a Hindu, has an only son B. On A's death B takes the whole 
ancestral property as the only surviving co-paTcener and then 
B is given in adoption by his mother to X. Suppose B has a 
daughter C born to him before his adoption to X Does B forfeit 
the estate taken by him as the last surviving male with the 
result that on B's adoption to Xhis daughter G takes the estate 
(which had already vested absolutely in B) as if he was dead 
in the family of A. The Bombay High Court has held in two 
decisions that on B's* 316 adoption to X in the above illustration 
he loses or forfeits the property he took as the last surviving 
co-parcener in the family of A and his daughter C would take 
the estate of B as if he were then dead ( though he is actually 
living ) The result of these decisions is that the verse of Manu 
is construed as laying down that though a man may have been 
absolutely entitled to certain property _ as a member of one 
family, on his adoption into another family he loses that estate 
which then passes on to his heir as if he had died on the day of 
adoption This construction of the verse of Manu has not been 
accepted by the Madras and Calcutta High Courts, 1317 which 
hold that an adoption does not divest any property which has 
vested in a man previous to his adoption into another family. 
It may be noted that the Bombay High Court itself gave a deci- 
sion 1318 which is inconsistent in principle with the two decisions

tion, because at the adoption it bad ceased to be the estate of his natural

cited above, when it held that where a father and his four sons 
partitioned ancestral family property and one of the sons was 
subsequently given in adoption into another family, the son 
so adopted was not divested by the subsequent adoption of 
the property already taken by the son on partition. la a still 
later case the Bombay High Court approves of its first decision 
in 40 Bom 429 and observe? : 1319 ' the verse of Manu refers not 
only to the nhUia of the natural father but also to the gotra of 
the natural father. It is quite clear that the gotra of the natural 
father is vested in the son by his birth. The gotra so vested in 
the son ceases after the son is given in adoption. It is difficult 
to understand why the riktha which is spoken of in the same 
manner as gotra in the verse should not cease by the entire cessa- 
tion of connection with the natural family. The gotra and 
riktha are inextricably joined together in a dvandva compound 
and it would follow logically as well as grammatically that the 
adopted son must lose both together and cannot lose the 
former and keep the latter.' In this passage the premiss 
that there is entire cessation of connection with the natural 
family is entirely wrong as has already been shown and will 
be shown a little later on. The adoptee's connection with the 
gotra of the natural family does not cease for all purposes at 
all. Therefore the reasoning of the passage quoted above is 
entirely misconceived and is further opposed to two well known 
rules of the Mimamsa evolved for the construction of texts On 
the interpretation given to Manu IX. 142 by the Bombay deci- 
sions that verse lays down two rules ( vidhis ), viz. (1) a person 
adopted into another family will not take the wealth of his 
natural father or any one in that family after adoption ; W 
that a person adopted into another family loses or forfeits on 
adoption wealth that he may have already taken absolutely in 
the natural family as a member of that family ^adoption 
These are two entirely different propositi «bb and the rule tf 
minims* is that one and the same sentence^ should notbo 
construed as laying down two rules <f»>Z$ffi?J&, 
rent sets of circumstances. To so construe a text is to oe guw

of the fault of vSkijabheda ( splitting up of a sentence bo as to 
yield two distinct rules). The V. Mayukha construed Manu 
IX 142 so as to indicate only one sense and avoid the fault of 
vakyabheda on the analogy of two examples diacuBsed in the 
Purvamlmamsa. 1321 works, but if the reasoning of the Bombay 
High Court were followed the same fault to avoid which Nlla- 
kantha strives hard would be committed. There is another 
nura£msa rule 1 ' 22 which will be violated by the Bombay High 
Court's interpretation of Manu IX. HZ viz. when an already 
existing, thing or entity and something to be accomplished 01 
brought about in future are spoken of together in a sentence 
the thing already existing or accomplished is mentioned simply 
for the sake of the thing to be accomplished The accomplished 
fact is adoption itself. Manu who mentions adoption or the 
adopted son which is an accomplished entity also mentions 
along with it the taking of property (rikthahaiana); hence 
that taking must have reference to the future bringing about 
and not the undoing of rikthaharana which had already taken 
place long before. 

That the gotra of the natural family persists in some 
matters even after a person is adopted is made clear by the 
digests. The Sam »» K. ( p. 182 ) says that every dattaka must, 
when entering on marriage, avoid the gotra of his natural as 
also of his adoptive father. The Dharmasindhu (III. p. 161) 
says the same and states that the prohibition against marriage

there it- no total or absolute cessation of gotra relation with tfw 
natural family for all purposes there is no reason why in the 
caw of wealth already taken before adoption there should 
Do a cessation or forfeiture or why the cessation of relation as 
to nktha, should not be restricted to the future. As regards 
s,apinda relationship there is some conflict among the digests 
The D. M. lm states that the dvyamuqiiuyana has to obsene 
the prohibitions against marrying a sapinda girl up to three 
degrees in the families of ^he natural father and of the adoptive 
father, while the simple dattaka has to observe sapinda rela- 
tionship based upon the presentation of rice balls in the adoptive 
lather's family for three generations (since the adopted son can 
generally have no particles of the body in common with the adop- 
tive father) and in the natural family sapinda relationship based 
upon particles of the same body for seven generations. The 
Nimayasindhu (III pp. 290-291} sets outthe various conflicting 
views and gives it as its own opinion that the sapinda relation- 
ship must be looked to in marriage up to seven generations in 
the rwtural as well as in the adoptive family ( in the latter it 
being based on the offering of balls of rice) According to the 
V. Mayukhafp 119) the simple adopted son has sapinda rela- 
tionship in the adoptive father's family for seven generation? 
and in the adoptive mother's family for five generations and it 
seems to hold that there is no sapinda relationship in the 
natural family ( owing to Manu IX. 142 ) The V. C { pp. 61 
66 ) appears to hold that the dvySmusysyana has to observe 
sapinda relationship (as stated in the D. M.), while as tothe 
simple dattaka there is sapinda relationship only in the adop- 
tive family for seven generations (as indicated by Manu 1A 
142) The Dharmasindhu (111 p. 161) states that sapinda 
relationship depends in its degrees on the question whether e 
adoption is made after upanayana in the "^^ff "* 
fore upanayana or whether all samskaras from juhOm ma are 
performed in the adoptive family.

Results of adoption 697 



The Bombay High Court 1325 has held that the adopted son 
oannot marry within prohibited degrees in the natural family, 
that to that extent an adopted son oannot be considered as not 
to have been born in hiB natural family and that the sapinda 
relationship is recognized in both the families for the purpose 
of prohibition of marriage. 

The Nir. S., the Dharmasindhu 1326 and the D. C pp. 48-49 
deolaie that the adopted son can perform the sraddha of his 
natural father if the latter has at his death no son or other 
qualified person to perform it. The Nir S. and the Sam 1327 K. 
( pp. 185-186 ) both say that the adopted son has to observe 
three days' mourning on the death of the natural father and 
nee vetsa; but the D M. and D. O ( p. 68 ) differ and state that 
the simple adopted son has to observe no mourning for his 
natural father or other relatives in the natural family. If a 
married man having a son is given in adoption (which is possi- 
ble in the Bombay Presidency ) the son (born before the adop- 
tion ) remains in the natural family and does not acquire the 
gotra and rights to property of the family into which his father 
is adopted. Yet the father who has gone into another family 
by adoption has been held to retain his right to give in adoption 
his son who was born before his own adoption and who Temains 
in the natural family 1328 . 

From the above discussion it follows that the person adopted 
retains the tie of blood with his natural family (so that he 
cannot marry a girl within the prohibited degrees from that 
family ), the samskaras already performed in the natural family 
are not repeated on him after adoption, he still retains the gotra 
so far that he cannot marry a gixl having the same gotra as his 
natural father and further he has according to most writers 
to observe mourning for his natural father. Therefore it is 
clear that the severance from the natural family brought about 
by adoption is only partial and restricted to pinda and riktha

Vas. and Baud, both laid down that if after a son is taken 
in adoption an amasa son is born to the adoptive father the 
former takes a fourth share. There is conflict among the smrtia 
and the digests about the share of the adopted son when an 
aurasa is subsequently born, and about the meaning of 'a fourth 
share'. The Dayabhaga (X. 13 p. 148) and V. C. p. 150 Quote 
a verse of Katyayana 1 * 30 that when an aurasa son is horn, 
other kinds of sons, if of the same caste as the father, take only 
a third of the estate. It has been held in Bengal that in these 
circumstances the adopted son takes one third of his adoptive 
father's estate. In Benares and among Jains 1331 the adopted 
son gets one fourth of the estate. The S. V. p. 393 holds 
that he gets 1332 £th. In Bombay it 1333 has been held that the 
adopted son takes not £th of the whole estate, but £th of the 
share of the aurasa son i. e. £th (the aurasa son taking fths). In 
Bombay the same rule applies among sudras 133i But in Bengal 
and Madras it has been decided, relying on a passage in the

1338a It appears to me that the V. Mayokha went far beyond the 
spirit of the ancient smrti texts and of most of the medieval digests when it 
allowed the adoption of a married man or even of one who had already had

an age when by proper training and environment he will come to entertain 
towards the adoptive parents the same feelmg that an aurasa son has. 
Hence it appears to me that the Legislature should intervene and prov.de 
that no one can be adopted after bis upanayana, or at all events after his 
marriage, in the natural family. It is natural for a sonless man or a widow 
to feel, apart from religious considerations, the necessity of a yonng reran 
as a solace, security and help in old age, and to adopt a person. Even in 
England by the Adoption of Children Act (16 and 17 Geo V chap 29) the 
adoption of a minor is now allowed after observing certain formalities. 
Further, no adoption by a *!dow who has not become major according to 
the Indian Majority Act should be held valid. An agreement or a transfer

CHAPTER XXIX 
ORDER OF SUCCESSION AFTER THE SON 

It has been stated above that dSya is either aprahbandha or 
saprahband7ia and that sons, grandsons and great-grandsons take 
the first kind of daya. If a man has no son either aurasa or 
secondary ( viz. the dattalca, the other kinds of sons being now 
forbidden or obsolete ), then his property devolves in a certain 
order. When a man dies sonless and is a member of a joint 
Hindu family then on the surviving coparceners the whole 
estate devolves except that after 1937 { by Act XVUI of 1937 ) 
his widow takes his place as to the joint family property Bat 
if he dies separated and has male issue ( from whom also he is 
separate ) then his male issue will succeed to him in a body 
viz. his son, grandson ( son of a predeceased son ) and great- 
grandson (son of a predeceased son's predeceased son) will 
together take his separate property per stirpes* From Manu IX 
137 ( which is the same as Vas. 17-5 and Visnu Dh. S. 15. 46 ) and 
186 and Yaj. I 78 it follows that the son, grandson and great- 
grandson equally confer great spiritual benefit and so are the 
principal group of heirs. According to the strict theory of tlie 
Mitaksara as stated above, son, grandson and great-grandson take 
by birth an interest even in property acquired by a man him- 
self, but they have no power to prevent him from alienating it. If 
one or more out of a man's sons, grand-sons or great-grandsons 
are separate from him then on his death his self-acquired 
property will first be taken by those sons, grandsons and great- 
grandsons that are joint with him and if none of these jb joint 
with him, the separated son, grandson and great-grandson will 
succeed per sttrpes to his estate. 1339 

This view is at least a B old as the Baud. 1318 Dh. S. L 5. 1M-

of his full brothers and of his son, grandson and great-grand- 
son from a savaraa wife as one group called ambhakta-daya 
sapindas and that in the absence of these only, the wealth of a 
man goes to his Bakulyas. 

On the succession to the property of a man dying" without 

male issue ( i. e. without son, grandson or great-grandson ) the 

basic texts are two verses of Y&jnavalkya 1341 (II. 135-136 ): 'The 

lawfully wedded wife, the daughters and ( the daughter's son ), 

the parents, the brothers, their sons, gofrajas (agnatic kinsmen), 

bandhu (cognatic relation), a pupil, a fellow student — on 

failure of each preceding one out of these each succeeding one 

iB entitled to take the wealth of a man who is dead ( lit. who 

has gone to heaven ) and who leaves no male issue. This rule 

applies to all varnas'. The Visnu Dh. S. ( 17. 4-15 ) is almost to 

the same effect. The word ' aputrasya ' in Yaj. is taken to mean 

one having no son, grandson or great-grandson ( at the time 

of death ) by V. C, Raghunandana and Mitramisra 1342 . The 

Mit, explains the words ' to all varnas ' as applying even to all 

that are the offspring of anvloma or piatiloma unions 

We have separate rales for inheritance to the property of 
males and to that of females. Then there is great difference 
as to the rights of women as heirs. First, inheritance to the 
property of males will be taken up. Here again the fundamental 
principles are different ace. to the Mit and the Dayabhaga 

Among the heirs (apart from male issue) of a man as 
regards his separate property the first is the widow The wife's 
right to succeed to her deceased husband's estate, when he died 
separated and un-reunited, was acknowledged only after a long 
struggle extending over centuries The passage of the Tai. S.

been quoted (on p. 606). The meaning of that word ia somewhat 
dubious, as -will be shown later on. The 5p. Dh. S. H 6. 14. 2 
states generally 1343 that in default of a son the nearest sapinda 
succeeds but does not expressly mention the wife as an heir, 
though it mentions ( in II 6. 14 4 ) the daughter as a possible 
heir. Baud also omits the wife as an heir Vas mentions 
no woman as heir. Gaut 28. 19 appears to state that the wealth 
of one who dies without issue should be taken by his sapindas, 
sagotras and sapravaras or his wife (i. e. according to Haradatta, 
the wife takes a share only along with the nearest sapinda or 
sagotra and not exclusively ). Haradatta himself was of this 
view. Manu does not declare that the wife is the heir of a sonless 
man and there are certain passages which impliedly exclude 
her, as e. g Manu IX. 185 ( the father takeB the wealth of a 
man dying sonless or his brothers take it ), IX. 217 { the mother 
should take the wealth of a sonless man). Sankha (q.by theMit., 
Dayabhaga XI 1. 15 ) prescribes that the wealth of a man dying 
without issue goes to his brothers, failing them the parents 
take it or the eldest wife. 134 * Devala ( q. by the Dayabhaga 
XI. 1. 17-18 and V.Rp 593 ) arranges the heirs in order as full 
brothers, daughters, father, half brothers, mother and wife. It 
may be noticed that in the days of Kalidasa the sonless widow 
did not succeed to the wealth of her deceased husband, but was 
only entitled to maintenance and that the estate escheated to 
the king. This is clear from the letter written by the minister 
to king Dusyanta about the wealth of a merchant who perished 
in a ship-wreck ( Act VI ) Yaj. and Visnu among smrti writers 
were probably the first to clearly enunciate the rule that the wife 
was the foremost heir of a man dying without male issue. Br. 
makes the wife the first heir of a sonless man and supports MB

opinion with reasons. He says: 13is 'In the Veda and in the 
doctrines of the smrtis and in popular usage the wife is declared 
to he half tha hody of the hushand, equally sharing the consequ- 
ences of good and evil acts. Of him whose wife is not dead half 
the body survives. How can another obtain the property, while 
half the body (of the deceased) lives? Although kinsmen, 
although his father, mother or his relatives may be alive, 
the wife of a man dying without issue succeeds to his share. 
A wife dying before her husband takes away his sacred fires 
( i. e. she is cremated with the sacred Vedic fireB, if he he an 
Agnihotrin ) ; but when the husband dies before the wife, she 
takes his property, if she be chaste '. Even when Taj. proclaim- 
ed the paramount right of succession in the case of widows 
there were other smrtis and some early commentators who did 
not subscribe to that view. Nar. ( dayabhaga, 25-26 ) provides 
that if among several brothers one who is childless dies or 
becomes an ascetic the others should divide the property except- 
ing strldhana, that they should make provision for his women 
till their death in case they remain faithful but if they are 
otherwise ( L e. unfaithful ) they may cut off the allowance '. 
Nar. ( dayabhaga, 50-51 ) provides that on failure of sons, the 
daughter, sakulyas, bandhus, a man of the same caste, the king 
succeed in order and thus omits the wife altogether. VySsa 1316 
(quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 28-19 and by Sm. O. H p. 281 ) 
holds that a wife may take the whole of the husband's property 
if it does not exceed 2000 panas in value. The Mit. tells us that 
Srlkara espoused this position that the wife takes the whole if

the property is email, but only maintenance if the property is 
large and refutes it by saying that it is opposed to the spirit of 
Yaj. who allows a share to the wife and the mother even along 
with eons when even joint family property is being partitioned 
and that the view is also liable to the fault of vidhixusamya on 
the analogy of the MlmSmsS rule stated ahove on p. 605. 13s7 
The same text of Yaj. will have to be held as laying down only 
maintenance when the husband left great wealth* and also 
laying down a share equal to that of a son when the husband 
leaves inconsiderable wealth. ivn <* Another view was maintained

1347a Jji. VII. 3 19-25 as understood by the Mit. may be briefly 
explained as follows: The CaturmSsyas {seasonal sacrifices) are four, 
VaisVadeva, Varuaapraghasa, Sakamedha, Sunasliiya (vide H of Dh vol II. 
pp 1091-1105 for description). In regard to these the following texts 
occur in the Veda and are cited by Sahara and others : ffiri imPtPit >

uttaravedi is required only in a Soma sacrifice. Therefore the pranayana 
prescribed ia • dvayoh pranayanh * is of the Somapranayana type. To this 
a partisan of the siddhaiitin (siddhantaikadesm) replies as follows: — The 
real view is that in dvayoh pranayanti the pranayana is of the simple dars'a- 
purnamasa type and the prohibition about Vaisvadeva and SunasTriya is not 
to be explained as you do ; in the words ' upatra vapanti ' an uttaravedi is 
generally (without exception ) prescribed for all caturmasyas, but ia the 
following two sentences ■ na vaisvadeve &c. ' the preparation of uttaravedi 
is forbidden in the case of Vaisvadeva and Sunasirtya , therefore the partisan 
says that the idea is that, though the pranayana is of the simple dar&purna- 
masa type, yet an uttaravedi is prepared in the 2nd and 3rd but not in the 
first and fourth of the caturmasyas. The purvapaksm retorts that even on 
this construction vidhivaisamya would still be there as follows : as there is 
prescription oi uttaravedi in all four and prohibition in two (viz the first 
and fourth of the four caturmasyas), there is an option of uttaravedi in 
these latter two (as the rule is ' tulyabala-virodhe vikalpah ') and there is 
no option as to the other two and there will arise the fault of vidhivaisamya, 
the same sentence viz ' upatra vapanti ' being taken as an unqualified and 
independent rule about the 2nd and 3rd of the 'caturmasyas and taken as an 
optional rule as to the 1st and 4th, - ' < 

The proper siddhanta view is as follows: Though the words ' dvayoli 
pranayanti ' are very general, they are to be narrowed down so as to refer to 
only two (viz. 2nd and 3rd of the catormasyas) on account of the recom- 
mendatory passage that follows ( speaking of Varunapragbasa and 'Sakamedba 
as the thighs of caturmasya yajfia) The vidhi and the following arthavada 
form one syntactical .whole (ehavikyo), as laid downbyjai 1.2 7. The 
arthavada passage means that just as a man marches on in strength if his 
thighs are strong, so the caturmasya sacrifice readhes a successful close bv 
means of Varunapraghasa and SaLamedha in which an uttarvedi is specially 
prepared and fire is laid thereon (being taken from the ahavaniya fire bv the 
adhvaryu and pratiprasthatr) Therefore the meaning is that there is prana- 
yana in the 2nd and 3rd ont of the four caturmasyas and uttaravedi is pres- 
cribed in those tuo alone and the words • there is no uttaravedi in Vaisva- 
deva and Sunasirrsa are a mere auuvSda (repetition of what is already 
known) and not a prohibition, as in the words ''fire should be kindled on 
the earth and not m the sky norm heaven". On this interpretation there 
is no vidhivaisamya Sahara makes two adhtkaranas of lai VII 3 19-25 
while Rumania makes one adhikarana of these seven eutras He'further 
differs as to the siddhanta, which, according to him, is that in ■ dvayoh 
pranayanti there js a special (apvrva) kind of pranayana prescribed, 
prakrla (of darsapurnatnasa type) and saamtka pranayana being the two 
other views which be rejects. The Subodhini on the M,t. very lucidly

take the estate of her soilless deceased husband if she submitted 
to myaqa and procured a son for the husband. This view derived 
support from Gautama 28-19-20, Vas. 17 65 (who prohibits 
niyoga if resorted to through greed of wealth ), and Manu IX- 
146 and 190 ( which call upon the surviving brother to pro- 
create a son on the widow of his brother and to hand over tlio 
deceased's share to that son ). This view is refuted by the 
Mit., 1318 Sm. C. H p. 294, V. P. pp 495-497. 

Even MedhStithi, 1349 generally a liberal writer, holds that 
the widow is prohibited from inheriting her husband's wealth. 

The Mit. after an elaborate statement and refutation of the 
views of Srlkara, DhSresvara and others due to the conflict 
among sinrti texts on the question of the widow's right of 
succession, establishes the proposition that the widow, if chaste, 
is entitled to the whole of her deceased sonless husband's 
wealth. 1350 Almost all writers since the time 'of the Mit. accept 
the widow's right to succeed to her husband's wealth Many 
writers note that the smrti texts on the heirship of the widow are 
in conflict. 1351 They explain verses like those of Nar. (dayabliaga 
35-26) providing only maintenance for women either as

referring to exclusively kept concubines of the deceased or to 
the wives of re-united coparceners. 

Pafoii means a -woman who is married to the deceased, the 
word being formed from 'pati' with an affix in the sense of 
' being fit to join with the husband in the performance of sacri- 
fice ' ( Panini IV. 1. 33 ). The Sm. O. II. p. 390 quotes a verse 
that a woman who iB procured for sexual intercourse in 
exchange for money is only a c?Sst and is not a paint and 
therefore is not entitled to inherit to a sonlesB paramour. 1352 
The Baud. Dh. S. I 11. 30 quotes a similar verse. Several texts 
require that the widow must be chaste before she can claim the 
inheritance of the deceased. A text attributed to Vrddba- 
Manu 1353 says, ' The wife alone, being sonless and keeping the 
bed of her lord unsullied and leading a life of religious obser- 
vances, may offer pinda to her deceased husband and take his 
entire estate*. Kat. (936) also declares that 'the wife who 
is chaste takes the wealth of her husband \ The widow must be 
chaste at the time the inheritance opens. The courts have held 
that once the husband's estate is vested in the widow, it will 
not be divested or forfeited by reason of unchashly subsequent 
to the death of the husband. 135 * If the widow remarries after 
inheriting,, then, though the remarriage of a widow is legalized 
by the Hindu "Widows' Remarriage Act ( XV of 1856 ), she 
forfeits the estate of the husband taken by her or the estate 
which she took as a widowed mother of her deceased son 
and it passes to the other heirs of the husband or son as 
if she were then dead and this applies to widows of all castes 
according to almost all High Courts ( even when remarriage

is allowed by the custom of the caste to which the widow 
belongs). 1355 

^ According to the DayabhSga there being no apratibandha 
daya, the widow of a sonless member even in a joint family 
succeeds to his share in the family property and there is no 
difference between joint family property and separate property. 

In the case of sudras, if the owner dies leaving a widow or 
a daughter or a daughter's son and an illegitimate son, it has 
been held by the courts following Yfij. H. 134, the Mit. and 
DayabhSga IX. 31 that the widow at daughter or daughter's 
son takes one half and the illegitimate son takes the other 
half. wss 

The rights of the widow in property inherited by her from 
her husband are limited. Kaut. HI 2 was ,357 probably the first 
to propound cleatly the characteristics of the Hindu widow's 
estate and the verse of Est quoted below is remarkably close 
to the words of Kaut. The MahSbharata (AnusSsana 47. 24) 
states that women have only the right to enjoy the estate of 
their husbands and that they should not waste or destroy the 

1355. Vide Vtthtt v. Govutd 22 Bom. 321 (F. B,J and tturttgayt v. 
Vtramakah I Mad, 226; but Bhola v. Kausilla 55 AU. 24 (F. B ) holds 
that a woman belonging to a caste »n which remarriage of -widows is allowed 
by custom does not forfeit on remarriage the estate of the first husband 
-which she took as his widow, the principal reasons being, that there is no 
express text about forfeiture on subsequent unchastity ana that it would be 
absurd to hold that a widow, who, on the P c/ ruling m 7 I. A , does not 
forfeit the estate taken as heir by subsequent unchastity, should be liable to 
forfeit it by remarriage (which presumes that she wants to live a decent life). 
Looking to the expressed object of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 
section 2 should not have been so interpreted as to apply to widows who 
could remarry according to caste custom before the Act.

husband'B estate ( by gift, sale &c.). Br. 1S3s ( S. B. E. vol. 33 
pp. 377-78 verses 50-51 and 53 ) states : 'when the husband is 
separate his -widow takes all hie various kinds of property such 
as a pledge, except immovable property. After having received 
movable and immovable property, gold, inferior metals, 
grain, liquids and clothes the widow shall cause (her husband's) 
monthly, Bix-monthly and annual sraddbas to be performed. 
Let her honour with funeral offerings and pious charity hev 
husband's paternal uncle, gurus ( elders ), daughter's son, sister's 
son and maternal uncle as also aged or helpless persons, guests 
and women'. Madhava (Par l/C. III. p. '536) explains that 
' except immovable property * means that she is prohibited 
from making a sale of immovable property without the consent 
of the male kinsmen. The V. MayQkha ( p. 138 ) accepts thiB 
interpretation and modern courts have done the same. In 
JDamodardas v.* Purmanandas 7 Bom. 155 it was held that a 
widow to whom movable property was bequeathed by the will 
of her husband takes it absolutely But here the movable 
property was riot vtih&tted by her and as it was a bequest by 
will it became her strldhana according to Nar ( q. by V. M. on 
p. 155 ), Besides, this was a case from Bombay Island and 
was governed by the law of V. Mayukha. In some early cases 
in Bombay it had been held that a widow in Western India 
under the Mit&ksara had absolute power over the movable 
property inherited by her from her husband. In Oadadhai u 
Chandiabhagabai 17 Bom. 690 ( F. B. ) it -was held that under the 
law of the Mit&ksara a widow has no power to bequeath move- 
able property inherited by her from her husband and that to 
that extent the decision in Damodar v. Purmanandas must be 
treated as of no authority if it be interpreted to have decided 
the point in that way. In Slia Cliamanlal v. Dosln Ganesh

power to dispose of it by will. Lastly in Pandharinath v. Govind 
32 Bom. 59 it was held, after an elaborate examination 
of authorities, that a widow is not under the Mitsksara 
competent to make a gift of the movables inherited by 
her from her, husband and it was said ,( on p. 75 ) that possibly 
with the spread of education amongst, and the general emancipa- 
tion of, their women Hindus may be led to call in aid the relief 
of Legislature. In cases arising under the Mayfikha a widow 
may dispose of movable property inherited by her from her 
husband by gift inter vivos but not by will. Eat. 13S9 (921, 924-925) 
propounds the limitations of, the widow's rights as follows : 
' A sonless widow, preserving the bed of her husband (unsullied) 
and residing with her elders and being self-controlled, should 
enjoy (her husband's property) till her death; after her the 
( other ) heirs ( of the husband ) would get it. A wife who 
preserves,^ the honour of ) the family would get the Bhare of 
her husband when he is dead till her_death, but she has no 
power ,to make a gift, sale or mortgage. A widow engrossed in 
religious observances and fasts, fixed in the vow of celibacy, 
always intent on restraining her senses and making gifts goes 
to heaven even though sonless '. 13W These verses show that the 
widow was to enjoy the income of her husband's property till 
her death ; that she could not sell or mortgage or give away 
immovable property without the consent of the heirs that 
would come after her and ,that for religious and charitable 
purposes or those that conduce to the spiritual welfare of her 
husband a widow had large powers of disposition. These rules

have been accepted by modern decisions; vide Collector of 
Masidtpatam o. Cavcdy V&wuta 8 Moo. I. A. 500 at p. 551 for an 
oftquoted passage about the widow's powers of disposal. There 
ifj a large volume of case law on the widow's powers of aliena- 
tion, on what are religious and charitable purposes and about 
the consent of the kinsmen, which have to be passed over here- 
The heir or heirs expectant on the death of a widow are called 
reversioners or reversionary hens in the decided cases. There 
is no exact Sanskrit word to convey the same idea except 
' day&da ' that occurs in Kat quoted above and in D. B., which 
makes it clear that the reversioners take the estate after the 
widow's estate ends ( by death, remarriage, surrender &c. ). The 
doctrine of the surrender by the widow of her estate in favour 
of the next heirs ( the reversioners ) whose estate is said to bo 
accelerated is based on meagre foundations viz. the words of 
Kat. and the D. B. quoted in n. 1359. Judicial decisions, how- 
ever, have raised a stupendous structure on these slight founda- 
tions; but they are passed over here. 

If a man dies leaving several widows then they may 
partition the property equally among themselves, as stated by 
the Mit. 1361 

If after partitioning among themselves, one of the widows 
dies, the portion given to her comes to the other widow 
or widows i.e. there is survivorship among them and no one 
else can succeed to the husband* property as long as there is 
any widow alive and not remarried. Hindu Law does not 
favour the distribution of a deceased man's estate among 
his several relatives, as some other systems (like that of 
the Moslems ) do It gi Yes the whole estate to one heir or one 
class of heirs to the exclusion of all others. It is greatly to 
the credit of the ancient Hindu Law that .it boldly gave all 
the separate property of a deceased male to women, viz. to the 

widow and after her to the daughter in preference to the man's 
own father or brother or nephew. Attempts are now bS* 
made through the Legislature that even when there Je *>ns 
the wadow and daughters of the deceased should be given shares'

in succeeding to her husband's estate. 

The words of the Tai S. quoted above ( p. 606 ) about women 
being without strength and not entitled to daya (adaysdlh) really 
occur in the ritual of Soma offerings and should mean that 
women are not allowed to share in the drinking of Soma. But 
the Baud. Dh. S. ( 8. B. E vol. 14 p 231 ) appears to have taken 
them as excluding women from inheritance. Manu IX. 18 also 
relies on it and declares that the sansMras on women (except 
marriage ) are not to be performed with Vedic mantras, as the 
Veda declares them to be 'nirindriya' and 'anrta'. Later 
writers like Haradatta ( on Gaut, 28. 19, 5p. Dh. S. H 6. 14. 1 ) 
and V. P. pp. 517 and 554 base the exclusion of women from 
inheritance on this passage of the Veda. They say that, though 
the Vedic text is very sweeping and general, it is meant to 
exolude only women other than those expressly mentioned in 
the smrtis as entitled to inherit. For example, the Dayabhaga 
XI 6. 11 quotes Baud, and remarks that the wife is entitled to 
inherit because of special texts ( like those of Yaj and Visnu ) 
in her favour. The Sm. C IT. p. 294 13 « B ays that the Vedio 
passage is only an arthavada ( meant for praise ) and not an 
absolute rule and it must be taken as not referring to those 
women that are expressly mentioned ( lit. by being seized by 
the horn ). The V. P. says the same. AparSrka ( p.743 ) holds 
that the Vedic passage is merely an anuvada and excludes 
women only when there is a son. It should be noted that the 
Par. M. (III. p. 536) holds that the Tai S passage merely means 
that the wife of the sacrifioer is not entitled to partake of Soma

struggle hard for recogmfcion as heir just as the widow had. 
Gaut Baud and Vas omit the daughters an heir. Ip %i 
S. IL 6. 143 recognizes the daughter as an optional heir 
{ probably with sapindas ). When Manu IX. 130 declares 'one's 
son is like one's self and one's daughter is egual to one's son- 
how can another person take the wealth ( of the deceased ) when 
she who is the very gelf (of the deceased) liveB', it appears 
from the context (IX. 128-129) that it is the *»rfn*5(the 
daughter appointed as a son ) that is intended to be referred to 
therein. Medbatithi, Narayana and Kulluka interpret the word 
' duhita ' in Manu IX 130 as applicable to the putriks only In 
the Nirukta, 1 ** Yaska cites ftg. IIL 31 1 as relied upon by those 
who support the claims of the daughter to inheritance and also 
derives the word ' duhita ' in various ways, but from his expla- 
nation of Ug. HL 31 1 it appears that he is referring to the 
putrika's right of inheritance. As the usage of appointing a 
daughter as a son became gradually obsolete, the ordinary 
daughter came to be recognized by analogy as the heir of a 
sonless man after the widow. Yaj. and Visnu both recognize 
the daughter aB an heir after the widow. Nar. ( dayabhSga, 50 ) 
recognizes 1366 the daughter as an heir after the son on the 
ground that she continues the lineage (of the deceased father) 
just like a son. When Nar. ( dayabhSga, 27 ) speaks of the 
daughter being entitled to maintenance till marriage, the con- 
text shows ( as remarked by the Sm. GEp, 296 ) that he is 
referring to the daughter of a person who was re-united at the 
time of his death. Br. declares 1347 (S. B. B. 33 p. 378 verses 
55-56 ), ' the wife is declared to be the inheritor of the husband's 
wealth and, in default of her, the daughter ; the daughter, like 
a son, springs from the limbs of a man : how oan another man 
inherit her father's property while she lives?'. Though the 
words of Yaj , Visnu and Br. were clear enough ancient com-

mentators were~hot prepared to accept them in their literal 
sense, Visvarupa holds that Yaj. means only the putrika and 
employs the plural in order to convey that several daughters 
may be appointed as sons. The Sm O. II. p 295 informs ns 
that the same opinion was held by Dharesvara, Devasvamin and 
Devarata. 1368 The Mit rightly refutes these views by saying 
that the word ' duhitaiah* in Yaj. cannot Tefer to 'putrika', 
riinee Yaj , has himself stated the putrika as equal to the aurasa 
eon ( in 31. 1&8 ), as the putrika is included among the sonB 
by Vas and as the widow and the daughters are declared by 
him as hews in the ahsence of all the sons, principal and secon- 
dary Ya] , Visnu, Br. are silent as to whether any discrimina- 
tion was made between daughters as heirs. Kat. { 926 ) gives 1369 
a preference to the unmarried daughter and the Mit. and the 
subsequent digests follow Kat. The - Dayabhaga 137D (XL 2. 4 
p. 175 ) quote* a prose passage of Parasara preferring an un- 
married daughter as an heir to a married daughter. Among 
married daughters the Mit., pressing into service a text of Gaut. 
on succession to Btrldhana, holds by analogy that among 
married daughters the indigent ( or unprovided for ) one is to 
be preferred to one who is well-placed. 1371 Herein the Mit. 
follows common sense and the natural, inclination of a father 
to feel more concern for a poor daughter. The Dayabhaga 
prefers the unmarried daughter to the married daughter as is 
done by the Mit., but among married daughters Jlmutavahana, 
following an author called Dlksita, prefers one who haB had a

in her father's estate when she succeeds as heir and on her death 
the* estate will' go to her own heirs. 

A. daughter is entitled to succeed, according to the decided 
oases, to her father's estate even if she be unchaste at the time of 
his death ( except in cases governed by the Dayabhaga ), 137S The 
reason assigned is that Kat. and other smrti writers do ' not 
expressly mention the requirement of chastity in the case of 
the" daughter' or mother as they do as regards the widow. 
According "to 'the 1 "" 7 * Dayabhaga ('XL' 2. 8 ) Br. declares': ' a 
daughter equal in" caste to the father and married to a husband 
of the same caste as her own, who is virtuous and intent r bn 

' serving her nusband;"inherits her father's property '. Therefore 
a daughter who is Unchaste cannot inherit.' Further a daughter 
succeeds not because she is' the daughter, but because she 
satisfies all' conditions laid down by Br. The' Dayabhaga (XL 

' a. 31 ) further says that the word ' wife ' (in XI. 1. 56) is merely 
Illustrative and whatever restrictions are imposed on the wife 
apply to all women as heirs." The illegitimate daughter, even 

"of a sudra, has no right of inheritance to her father. 1377 

By virtue of local or family custom daughters have in some 
cases been held to be excluded from, inheritance. 1378 - , 

It may-be noted that in his Yaijayanti ( on Vismi Dh. S.

been held by the Indian High Courts that though chastity 

s not required in the case of daughters to entitle them to 

inherit, yet in a competition between a married daughter and a 

daughter who was never married, but became a concubine or 

prostitute, the latter would be postponed to the former as the 

latter is not a virgin though unmarried. Some smrtis like 

Parasara 13 * 1 employ the word kuniarl in speaking of daughters' 

succession, while others employ the word * kanya\ but both 

words are synonymous In Gomnd v. Bhlcu 46 Bom. L. R. 699, 

where a man died leaving as heirs a married daughter juid 

another daughter who never married, but was living as the 

permanent concubine of another man, it was held that the latter 

cannot inherit the property of her sonless father to the exclusion 

of or along with his married daughter. The old texts speak of 

only unmarried daughters and married daughters and prefer 

the former to the latter. Medbatithi on Manu IX 13a says that 

kanya means a girl who has had no sexual intercourse with any 

man. The Mit. makes three classes of daughters succeed one 

after another via (1) unmarried daughter, {%) indigent married 

daughter, (3) well-to-do married daughter. Judicial decisions 

have added a fourth variety via unmarried daughter who has 

become a prostitute. This fourth class being a new one must be 

placed after the other three classes expressly mentioned by the 

texts and commentaries on the basis of the maxim ( intruders

EL. 134 } stated that the illegitimate son of a sudra takes the 
whole estate if there be no legitimate son provided there exists 
no heir up to the daughter's son, the latter must have been 
intended to be an heir by Yaj. taking after the daughters. The 
Madanapari jata ( p. 672 ) relies on the word ' ca ' in Yaj. to 
bring in the daughter's son. Though the printed text of Visnu 
Dh. S. is silent about tbe daughter's son, the Mit., the Daya- 
bhsga and others quote a verse of Visnu, 1382 ' when there is no 
continuance of lineage through sons and son's son the daughter's 
sons take the wealth (of the deceased owner); in offering 
fcr&ddha to the ancestors, daughter's sons are regarded as son's 
sens'. The V. Mayukha (p. 142) includes a sutra about the 
dauhitra in Visnu Dh. S. Govindaraja, a commentator of ,Manu, 
issaid by the DSyabhaga, to have held, relying on .this verse of 
Visnu, that the daughter's son inherited the estate even before 
a married daughter of the deceased. But the Dayabh&ga did 
not approve of this view. The DayabhSga (JXL g 27) notes

should inherit the entire wealth of a soilless man, that he should 
offer one pinda to .his father and another to the maternal grand- 
father and that in religious matters- there is no difference 
between a son's son and a daughter's son, since their father and 
mother (respectively) spring from the body of the deceased 
owner. The context and the wording of these verses show, as 
held by Kullufca and other commentators", that the daughter's 
son here referred to is the son of the appointed daughter.' But 
Mami IX.136 is somewhat clearer. It says, 'through' a son born

verse also only refers to' the son of the putriks' and that krta' 
means an appointed daughter with regard to -whom an'expreBS

HI] Father and mother as hens 721 

Visnu Dh. 1385 S. as read by most digests places the father before 
the mother Mann IX 217 states that when the son dies 
issueless the mother takes his wealth, while Manu IX. 185 
provides that the father takes the wealth of a sonless man and 
the brothers also. So Manu is not definite about the preference 
among parents. Kit. ( 927 ) observes, 13S6 ' of a sonless man (the 
heirs ) are declared to be the wife of good family, the daughters, 
the father on failure of them, the mother, the brother and ( the 
brother's ) sons'. Br. ( S. B E. 33 p. 379 v 63 ) says, 1387 * when 
a son dies without leaving his own wife or male issue, his 
mother is to be considered as heT son's heir or a brother may 
succeed with the consent of the mother'. In this conflict it 
may be stated that the Mit , the Madanaparrjata, S. V (p. 416 ), 
the V. C, the V. P. prefer the mother to the father , while the 
Dayabhaga, the Sm. 0., the Madanaratna, the V. Mayukha 
pref er the father to the mother. Srlkara i388 held that both 
parents, if alive, succeed together. But the Dayabhaga, Sm. C

case when separately used may be compounded together to form a dvandva, 
when they are employed to convey the sense of 'ca', as said in 'csrthe dvandvah' 
(Pan. II. 2 29 ). Such a compound is called dvandva and matx-pitarau Is an 
example of it Another sutra (I 2 64 ) of Pamm states that when words 
denoting several individuals of the same kind are to be compounded together, 
only one of them may be retained and that is called an efcas'esa compound, 
which ts of two kinds, sarTipa ( e. g, hamsasca hamsasca hamsau ) and mrSpa 
(-when the two words are of different genders) The latter kind of eLa^esa 
is of restricted use In Snch a compound when a mate add female are asso- 
ciated together only the word in the masculine gender remains or the word 
•pitr' when compounded with matr (vide Pan. 1,2. 67 and I 2 70). There 
fore we have two forms to denote the idea of parents viz. matapttarati ot 
pitarau. In dissolving this compound (pitarau ) we employ the phraseology 
' mata ca pita ca * and m the word ' matapitarau * the word for mother comes 
first. Therefore among parents as heirs mother should come first Vide 
pp. 242-244 of my notes to the V. MaySkha (ed. of text ) where both the 
Mit. passage and its criticism by the V. Mayukha are explained at length. 
In BalMshna v. Lakshman 14 Bom. 605 both the Mit. and Mayukha's 
criticism thereof are set out (pp. 608-609).

contain no such direction, all grammatical works like the 
Easika dissolve the compound as 'mata ca pits ca* and gram- 
matical usage for centuries supports the argument that the 
word mata comes first 1391 . The argument about the mother 
being nearer is quite specious Looked at from the son (whose 
inheritance is in question), the mother and father are both 
equally proximate. The Y. P. holds that according to the 
maxim that even a slight ground of difference leads one to 
determine (priority) the mother should be preferred to the 
father (since we dissolve the compound as mata capita ca). 
The V.P. (p 525) further tries to get over the text of "Visnu 
(putting the father before the mother) by explaining that if the 
mother is most worthy as a pahurata and the father an ordinary 
man she should be preferred but if the father is more worthy 
than the mother he should be preferred. Hardly any one sup- 
ports V. P. and the courts have not followed this. Owing to the 
difference of opinion among the digests on the question of the 
preference between parents as heirs, queer results follow. Por 
example, in the province of Bombay itself the father is pre- 
ferred as an heir to the mother in Gujerat, the island of Bombay 
and in Northern Konkan (because in these regions the V. 
Mayukha has been held to be of paramount authority ), while 
in the rest of the Bombay Presidency the mother is preferred to 
the father as an heir. The mother takes a limited interest as 
an heir which is the Bame as the interest taken by a widow as 
heir to her husband. The father would take an absolute inte- 
rest. The word mother includes an adoptive mother; that is 
if an adopted son dies leaving no son, widow, daughter ox 
daughter's son, the adoptive mother would succeed 13 ' 2 to him 
as an heir (and even in preference to the adoptive father in 
those provinces where the Mit. is the supreme authority) In 
the case of a dvyamusyayana adoption, if the son adopted in 
that form dies leaving only his adoptive mother and natural 
mother, it has been held that both the mothers take his estate

as co-heiresses 13n It has further been held that if, after suc- 
ceeding as adoptive mother to a dvyfimusyayana son, the adop- 
tivo mother again adopts a son, the latter does not deprive the 
natural mother of the half share taken by her as heir of the 
deceased dvyamusyayana son. 

The word ' mother ' in the Mit. does not include a step- 
mother. The latter is not recognised as an heir of her step-son 
at all in the whole of India (except in Bombay) on account of 
the rule of the exclusion of women from inheritance 1394 except 
where texts expressly mention them as heirs and the property 
would go to the crown instead of to the step-mother, if the 
latter alone were left, but she would be entitled to maintenance 
In Bombay the step-mother would inherit as the widow of a 
gotraja sapinda, but she is assigned a remote ,39s place among 
gotraja sapindas If a widow remarries and then her son by 
her first husband dies without leaving a child, a widow, a 
daughter or daughter's son his remarried mother is allowed to 
inherit to him by the 1396 Bombay High Court, though if she 
inherited first as a mother and then remarried, she is held by 
the same court to forfeit the inheritance taken (on account of 
section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Eemarriage Act of 1856). 

The mother succeeding to her son takes only a limited 
estate i. e. she cannot alienate it except for legal necessity If 
Vijfianesvara's definition of strldhana be literally interpreted 
even property inherited from a son would be strldhana. There 
is a striking example in E. I. vol. XIV p. 83 (the Srlrangam 
plates of Mummadi Nayaka in sake 1280) where a mother in- 
heriting a village granted to her son Farasarabhatta made a 

gift of it to the god Ranganat ha at Srlrangam.

HI] Brothers and tkevr sons as heirs 7X5 

Brothers (bhratarah) and brother's sons. Aoc. to both tY«. 
and Visnu, on failure of the parents the brothers succeed and 
on failure of brothers, brother's sons inherit. There we appa- 
rently conflicting texts, Sankha, Manu(IX. 185) and others 
giving the inheritance to the brothers even before the parents. 
All these are somehow reconciled and almost all digests from 
the Mit. downwards are agreed that brothers inherit after the 
parents But again a conflict of views ensues. The Mit Bays 
that among brothers, those of full blood inherit in preference 
to half mothers ( i. e. sons of the same father but sprung from a 
different mother). It then says that on failure of both kinds 
of brothers, the inheritance goes to brother's sons; but even 
here the sons of full brothers are preferred to sons of half 
brothers This view of the Mit. is shared by the Dayabhaga 
and almost all eminent writers of digests except the author of 
the Y. Mayukha. The Mit. pref cts thB full brother to the half 
brother on the ground that the full brother has particles of the 
bodies of both the father and the mother of the deceased, while 
the half brother has only the particles of the father's body ( the 
mother being different ) Therefore the full brother is neaTer 
than the half brother. The Dayabhaga argues 1397 that the full 
brother offers pindas to the Bame three paternal ancestors and 
the same three maternal ancestors to whom the deceased was 
bound to offer pindas and is to be preferred to the half brother 
who offers pindas to the three paternal ancestors of the deceased 
alone (but not to the maternal ancestors of the deceased). This 
view of spiritual benefit being the governing principle in pre- 
ferring the full brother to the half brother is accepted by 
Apararka (p. 745 ) 13?s The reasons of the V. Mayukha for pre- 
ferring even the full brother's son to the half brother are : the 
word* brothers' principally stands for 'brothers of the whole 
blood' (sodara) and only secondarily for brothers of the half 
blood. The general rule of Mlmamsa. 1359 is that the same word is

not to be understood in the same sentence or rule as used in the 
primary and also in the secondary sense. Just as the word 
'mother' applies only to the natural mother (and not to the 
step-mother), so bhratarah should not include both full and half 
brothers. The V. Mayukha is however wrong. As pointed out 
by the Dayabhaga, when Yaj wants to speak of the full brother 
he employs the words 'sodara' ( Yaj. II. 138) and when he wants 
to refer to the half brother he employs the word ' anyodarya' or 
'cmyamatrJa , (Yaj. IL 139). Therefore the word 'bhratarah' 
applies to both full and half brothers in the primary sense. 
There are other smrti texts suoh as that of the Smrti-sangraha 
stating that brothers are of two kinds viz. those of full blood 
and those of half blood, 1100 

TheSm. 1401 C. n.300 refutes the view of some that the 
word ' bhratarah ' in Yaj. is an eka&esa dvandva compound 
that it means ' brothers and sisters ' according to Fan. J. % 68 
( bhrutr-pulrau ivasT-duhtrbkyfim ) and that on failure of 
brothers sisters inherit. The V. Mayukha 1402 also does not 
accept this interpretation of ' bhratarah ' advanced by some, 
since there is no reason why 'bhratarah' should be taken 
as an ekasesa of the verupa kind ( which is restricted only 
to rare oases ) and not of the sarupa kind. The Bslambhattl 
supports the wider interpretation of ' bhratarah ' and at one 
time the Bombay High Court was inclined to accept this

interpretation. 1403 The above shows that some at least of the 
medieval and later Hindu jurists were more sympathetic and 
well disposed to the enlargement of the rights of women, though 
their views failed to secure general acceptance It has been 
held that brothers by the same father ( though by different 
mothers) are preferred to brothers by the same mother (though 
by different fathers ), it being pointed out that " there is no 
provision in the Mitaksara or elsewhere for the sons horn of 
the same mother after her remarriage being treated as brothers 
of the same womb for the purpose of inheritance so as to be 
included in the meaning of the word ' bhratarah * used in the 
texts." 1 ** But Nandapandita expressly provides in his 
"VaijayantI the following order of succession among brothers 
and sisters of the whole and of the half blood • (1) brothers of 
the whole blood, (2) sisters of the whole blood, (3) brothers who 
are sons of the same father, (4) brothers who are sons of the same 
mother ( vide Jolly T. L. L pp. 208 and 287 ). Because Manu 
IX. 217 says that the wealth of a childless man is taken by the 
mother and that if the mother be dead, the father's mother 
would take it, the Sm. C. 31 p. 299 places the paternal grand- 
mother before the brothers, but it Btands almost alone in this 
and the Mit. observes" 05 that Manu does not lay down the 
order but only provides that the paternal gTand-mother is an 
heir capable of inheriting. The V. P. (p. 527) expresses its

take, while Mann, Sankha and others are deemed to be only 
oonoerned with declaring the right of certain persons to 
inherit. 

The V. MaySkha proposes a special order of inheritance 
as follows: — (1) full brothers; (2) then full brother's sons, 
(3) the gotraja sapindas of whom the first is the paternal grand- 
mother, (4) then the sister, (5) then the paternal grandfather 
and the half brother at the same time, (6) then the paternal 
great-grandfather, paternal uncle and the half brother's son 
together. It should be noted that this conjoint inheritance by 
heirs of different degrees of ascent and descent which ib 
peculiar to the Mayukha has been regarded by the Bombay 
High Court as unknown m practice and obsolete 14< * Therefore 
it is probable that even in districts governed by the Mayukha 
the order of heirs after the paternal grandmother and full 
sister would be half brother, then half sister and then half 
brother's son and then it will be the same both according to the 
Mit and the Mayukha. 

The Mit. does not expressly mention the sister at all but 
the Bombay High Court has held her to be a veiy near hen- 
even where the Mit. is paramount, placing her after the brothers 
(whether full or half), brother's sons (whether of the whole 
blood or half blood ) and paternal grandmother, the difference 
from the Mayukha being that under the latter the full sister 
comes only after' the full brothers and full brother's sons 
and paternal grandmother and before half brothers and half 
brother's sous. 

One passage of the Mayukha, being wrongly translated by 
Borradaile, has led the courts (including the P.O.) to 
decide that full brothers succeed along with the sons o 
a deceased full brother wherever the Mayukha » ^eme. The 
passage of the Mayukha as translated by Borratol C jd»

HI ] Misunderstood, MayukJia passage 729 

The text of the Mayukha is given in the note below. It is 1407 
almost the same as a passage of the Mitsksara, which has not 
been misunderstood. Both passages contemplate a case like 
this A dies leaving B, C, D, his brothers, as his nearest heirs, 
so that A's estate vests in interest in B, G, D. Before the 
estate of A is actually divided by metes and bounds, B dies 
leaving three sons E, F, G-. The last three had no right to the 
property of A at their uncle A's death because their father B 
was living at the time (i. e. pitrvyamaianakSle jivatpitrkataiiU 
asanjata-dhanasambandfiah ). Yet when the property is later on 
actually to be divided they ( E, F, G ) will take the share which 
their father B would have taken if the property of A had been 
divided at the moment of A's death. Here a distinction is 
drawn between vesting of property ( dhamsambandha ) and its 
actual partition. Bat, in order to entitle nephews to take by 
actual partition, their father should have survived the deceased. 
This is the real meaning. 

The Privy 110 * Council, following a wrong translation, held 
that, under the law of the V. MaySkha, brothers and the boub

of a brother that died before the propositus ( the brother inherit- 
ance to whom is m question ) shared the estate of the latter. 
This erroneous decision has been persisted in to this day on the 
principle of ska e decisis The view of the VaijayantI about the 
sons of the same woman from different husbands being eapindas 
of each other has already been noted ( p. 727 ). GovindarSja on 
Manu DI 11 says that it is wellknown that children of different 
fathers but of the same mother are spoken of as brother and 
sister. Kulluka on Manu IH 11 refers to this .view of 
Govindaraja- 1109 

A question arises whether the distinction between full 
blood and half blood made by the Mifc in the case of brothers 
and nephews was to be carried beyond them Though a 
Full Bench 1410 of the Bombay High Court held that the dis- 
tinction was not to be carried Beyond brothers and nephews 
and that paternal uncles of the half blood inherited along 
with paternal uncles of the full blood, the Privy Council over- 
ruled this decision and held , that the preference of the whole 
blood to the half blood extends to all sapindas of the same 
degree from the common ancestor ( and therefore a paternal 
uncle of the whole blood excludes one of the half blood ) Tho 
Madanaparijata"" p. 674 expressly extends the preference of 
the whole blood to paternal uncles.

m j Compact sene* of Mrs 731 

It is noteworthy thatfhe VSramitrodaya which generally 
follows the Mit invokes the principle of spirited benefit in 
preferring the Ml toother's son to the half brother s son 

The heirs from the wife to the brother's sons are spoken 

of as "baddhakrama' (lit whose order is feed) in theMit., 

the Y Mayukha ( p. 143 ) and other works and as the compact 

series' ( of heirs ) ' in the case law For example, in rejecting 

the view of some that rely on Manu IX. 217 that the father's 

mother succeeds immediately after the mother.it is said that 

the heirs from the parents to the brother's son being mentioned 

in a feed order (by Taj.), no place can be found foithe 

father's mother in the feed series of heirs and that Manu IX. 187 

indicates only this that the father's mother is an heir.* 413 The 

V. Mayukha relies on the popular maxim that when certain 

persons are specially invited for a meeting or a dinner they 

are seated on seats definitely allotted to them but that those 

who come uninvited are assigned places at .the end of the row 

of those who were specially invited MM 

The question arises whether the brother's son's son inherits 
immediately after the brother's son and before any other heir. 
There is a conflict among Sanskrit ■writers on this point. The 
Sm. C. II p. 300, 141s the SubodhinI, the Madanaparijata (p. 673) 
say that the compact series ends with the brother's son, while 
ApaTSrka, Taradaraja ( V. Kir. p. 453 ) and the Vaijayantt of 
Nandapandita hold that the brother's son's son comes immediate-

]y after the brother's son. A Full Bench of the 14 " Bombay 
High Court holds, basing its decision on the usage of the 
province, that the compact series ends with the brother's son, 
while the Privy Council would seem to lend colour to the view 
that in the Benares school it ends with the brother's son's son. 
The DSyabhSga ( XL 6. G p. 208 ) places the brother's son's son 
immediately after the brother's son on the ground of the 
superior efficacy of the pjndas offered by him. 

Golrqjas (lit. 'those born in the same gotra' or agnates). 
Yfij. says that on failure of the heirs up to brother's sons the 
gotrajas succeed. Though one's father, brothers and brother's 
sons oIbo are really gotrajas, they are expressly assigned cer- 
tain fixed places in the order of heirs and other persons born 
in the gotra are included in the term gotrajaB on the analogy 
of such an example as ' let the cattle be brought and also the 
hullB' where the bulls, though really included under 'cattle' 
(gamh), are separately mentioned in order to emphasize that 
special attention must be paid to them on account of their in- 
tractable nature. Vide p 536 note 966 above. Ace. to the Mit 
gotrajas ore the father's mother ( as the first among them ), then 
other sapindas and samanodakas. The V. Mayukha (p 143) 
also says the same thing and places the father's mother as the 
first among gotraja sapindas. It may be remarked that Yaj. 
avoids the word Bapinda and employs the word gotraja. The 
Mit. and MayQkha state that sapindas succeed as heirs and that 
sapindas are of two kinds, viz. gotrajas (horn in or having the 
same gotra as the pt oposttus ) and those that are born in ( or are 
of) a different gotra. These latter (viz Wnrniagtitra sapivVfJ 
are designated as handtim by Yaj. Therefore it comes to tta 
that, though Yaj. does not employ the word sapinda, the inheri- 
tance goes after the brother's son to the nearest sapinda x«j.

HI ] Meaning of sapinda in Manu 733 

3p. Dh. S. H 6. 14. 2 provides 1 * 17 that ' on failure of sons 
the nearest sapinda' (inherits). Manu u18 IX. 187 is the classi- 
cal text on this point, which appears to mean literally, ' whoever 
is nearest from among the sapindas, to him the estate (of the 
deceased) Bhall belong*. This verse has been variously ex- 
plained by the commentators and digests and variously trans- 
lated by eminent Judges and writers on Hindu Law. The 
chief difficulty lies in the expression ' sapindadyah' and the 
words 'tasya tasya'. Some take the first as equal to two words 
'sapindat yah ' and others as one word ' sapindadyah * ( sapinda 
and the like ). Some take one ' tasya ' ( of him ) as referring to 
the deceased and the other to the inheritor; while others take 
'tasya tasya' as both referring to the inheritor alone, corres- 
ponding to ' yah * ( one more ' yah ' being suppressed for the sake 
of metre) Though the printed text and most of the commen- 
taries read the half verse of Manu as in the note below there are 
several digests that read it differently. lor example, the Sm. 
C H p. 301 reads it as 'yo yo hyanantarah pindat* and quotes 
DharesvaTa'B explanation that 'pindat' means 'sapindaf. 
Kulluka and the Dayatattva p. 195 explain * sapindaf as 
' sapindamadhyat ' ( from among sapindas ) and this appears to 
be the bes t explanation. Br. 1 * 19 (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 verse 62)

note on this in S. B. E. vol. 25 pp. 366-368 for the varying inter- 
pretations of commentators. Buhter is not right when he emphatically 
says- "On philological grounds it seems to me improbable that « anantarah 
sapindaf can mean anything else than 'nearest to the sapinda • and that 
this sapinda can be anybody else than the deceased". In the first place

Dim. It appears to have been used in the sense of blood rela- 
tionship as stated by the Kasika. According to the Mit the 
right to inheritance depends upon blood relationship ( connec- 
tion through particles of the same body, ekaiarira,auav!inravn) 
and the preference among those who are blood relations is deter- 
mined by nearness or propinquity (pi-ati/asath) According to 
the Dayabhaga, sapinda relationships is based on religious 
efficacy i. e. on the capacity to offer the cake or ball of rice in 
sraddha and it has evolved a peculiar method of determining 
preference which will be explained immediately below. That 
there appears to have been a close connection between taking 
the wealth of the deceased and offering sraddha to him 
may be admitted But the question is whether a person was 
deemed to be an heir and entitled to take the estate of 
the deceased because he offered sraddha to that person or 
whether the heirship was originally determined on other 
grounds and whoever took the estate was saddled with the 
responsibility of performing foaddhas for the benefit of the 
soul of the deceased. It U difficult to give a convincing 
answer to this. It appears, however, that ancient sutras 
do not emphasize the religious efficacy of pindas as the 
determining principle in heirship. Sp., Manu, Br. ( particular- 
ly the first and last ) speak only of nearness ( which more 
naturally means ' nearness of blood ' ). Ysj omits the word 
sapinda altogether in mentioning heirs Manu IX. 142 states 
that pinda follows the gotra and riktha ( wealth ) Visnu Dh. 
S. XV. 40 declares, ' whoever inherits the estate (of the deceased) 
has to offer pinda to him '. This rule is emphasized even by 
those works (like V. Mayukha)'«° that make blood relationship

view is upheld by V. H , V. G, Par. M., Madanaparijata, baras- 

vattYilaBa, V. Mayukha, Balambhatti and many other works. 1 he 

theory of the Dayabhaga is propounded by only a few medieval 

works, and writers like ApaTarka ( quoted above on p 7*-5 ), 

Eaghunandana, Nandapandita. The Vlromitrodaya generally 

follows the Mit. but in certain cases it relies on or refers to the 

principle of religions efficacy in preferring one heir to another, 

as for example, in preferring the full brother to the step-brother 

(compare note 1397 and V. P p 5&8) or in preferring three male 

descendants to the widow It is therefore that the Privy Council 

remark, tm ' now it is absolutely clear that under the Mit&ksara 

while the right of inheritance arises from blood lelatiouship or 

community of blood, in judging of the nearness of blood lelotion- 

ship or propinquity among the gotrajas the test to be applied to 

discover the preferential heir is the capacity to offer oblations '. 

Its position is peculiar. 1422 It says that the capacity to offer 

pindas is not the governing principle as to heirship, but it is 

only useful in finding out the preferential heir among gotrajas. 

Vjsnu quoted by the Mit (not found in the piinted 
Dharmasutra ) prescribes ■ ' If there be no son or . grandson 
left for continuing the line, the daughter's sons shall take the 
wealth, for m regaid to the obsequies of ancestors daughter's 
sons are regarded as son's sous '. This is in line with ManulX. 
136 ( cited above on p 720 ) which says that the daughter's son 
should offer the pinda ttnd take the wealth. Therefore it appears 
that Mami, Visnu and others relied upon the capacity for the 
offering of pinda as the reason for being entitled as heir, hut 
that this idea was vague and not elaborated in any way. The 
idea that blood lelationship settled the right to inheritance is 
implicit in the order of heirs in Yaj Taj. ( 31. 1&7 ) in speaking 
of the ksetraja son says that he inherits the wealth of both ( the

begetter and the husband of the wife on whom he is begotten ) 
and offers pinda to both. He does not state that because lie 
offers pinda to both he inherits the wealth. So this verse also 
favours tho view that offering of pinda was a duty laid up- 
on him who took the wealth ( except in the case of male issue). 
Hence it appears that the theory of the Mifc. also has a very 
respectable antiquity and further it has been followed by most 
medieval writers throughout India ( except in Bengal ). 

The argument of the Dayabhaga ( which was propounded 
beforo it by a writer probably named Udyota 1423 ) that the 
taking of a deceased person's estate depends, upon the spiritual 
benefit conferred on him is briefly as follows. It relies princip- 
ally on Baud Dh. S and Manu. In the section on the partition 
of wealth { which begins from IX. 103 ) Manu (IX. 137) declares 
the super-eminent spiritual benefits conferred by tho son, 
grandson and great-grandBon; furtbor ( in IX 106 ) Manu states 
that tho son gets all wealth from his father because he frees 
the latter from debt, that ( in IX. 139 ) the daughter's son also 
is spoken of as saving the grandfather in the next world and 
as therefore entitled to the grandfather's wealth, that the verse 
immediately preceding Manu IX. 187 (declaring that the 
nearest amongst sapindas inherits ) speaks of the offering of 
pinda to three ancestors; and since it i'b reasonable to presume 
that the blind and the like are excluded from inheritance 
( Manu IX 201 ) because they are incapable of performing 
religious rites, it follows that Manu and others regarded the 
taking of wealth as dependent on the conferring of spiritual 
benefit. This point of view the Dayabhaga emphasizes at every 
step It" 2 * says: "There are two purposes for which weaun 
is acquired, viz. for worldly enjoyment and for the unseen or 
spiritual benefit derived from making gifts and the lite! : «» 
when the acquirer is dead, he cannot have «W™w*rf™ 
wealth and the only purpose that remains is the unseen purple 
or benefit. It is therefore that Br. says, from ^ the weaM 
inherited, the inheritor should carefully set apart half for ^ 
benefit of the deceased for defraying the «p»jfj*»

monthly, sis-monthly and annual sraddhas ". The subject of 
sraddhas will be dealt with in another volume.. But here it is 
necessary to say a few words, for making the position of the 
Dayabhaga clear. Among the several kinds of sraddhas two 
deserve notice, viz. Ekoddtsta and Parvana. 1 * 25 The first 
( ekoddtsta ) is performed for the benefit of a single deceased 
person. There "are sixteen such sraddhas performed for the 
benefit of the deceased during the course of one year after his 
death or on the 11th day of death And every year on the 
anniversary 'of death an ekoddista sraddha may be performed 
for a deceased person. The parvana sraddha is performed on 
certain specified days, such as the amavasya of a month, or 
particularly in the dark half or on the amavasyU of Bhadrapada 
or on a sankranti. In this sraddha the three deceased paternal 
ancestors of <the performer are principally invoked and the 
three deceased paternal ancestors of his mother aTe also invoked 
but their invocation is secondary and is dependent on the 
principal invocation. TheTe is one more word that must be 
explained here viz. sapmdana or sapmdikarana. This is a sraddha 
rite performed one year after the death of a person or on 
the 13th day from his death. By this sraddha the person 
recently deceased ceases to be a preta ( a departed spirit ) and 
is elevated to the rank of pitrs (Manes). , The widow and daughter 
can perform only the ekoddista sraddha, while sons, grandsons 
and great-grandsons can perform the parvana sraddha also. 
The Dayabhaga refers ( XL 1. 34 p. 162 ) to the fact that the three 
male descendants, by performing the parvana sraddha, confer 
great spiritual benefit on the owner ( compare note 1343 above ) 
Elsewhere (XL 7. 17 p. 211) ft designates the parvana as

a widow by leading a chaste life, by offering water mixed with 
sesame every day to her deceased husband, by making gifts and 
observing fasts saves himself and her husband in the next world- 
It adds that if the widow misbehaves 8he makes her husband 
fall, as husband and wife share in the fruits of each other s 
good and evil deeds. Therefore the widow takes her husband's 
wealth for his benefit Brhan-Manu (q. by theDgyabhaga 
XL 1. 7 and by the Mit. ) declares that a sonless chaste widow 
should offer pinda to her husband and take his entire estate 
Similarly Prajapati (cited above on p 709 and quoted by 
even the V. Mayukha and other works of the Mitaksara school ) 
requires the widow who inherits all the movable and im- 
movable property of her deceased husband to perform the 
monthly, six-monthly and annual sraddhas of her husband. 1W 
Similarly the Dayabhaga allows the unmarried daughter or a 
married daughter having a son ( or who is likely to have a son ) 
to inherit because her son will offer pinda to the owner who 
will be the maternal grand-father. It prefers the daughter's 
son 1428 as an heir even to the father because the former offers a 
pinda to the owner himself, while the father offers pindas 
to two of the three paternal ancestors to whom the owner would 
have been bound to offer pindas. The D. B. winds up by 
saying 142 ' that the order of inheritors must be followed in such 
a way that the wealth of the deceased may be most beneficial 
to (the soul of) the deceased. In certain respects the D. B, 
does not strictly and logically follow its own theory but is

according to the D. B. is ; son, grandson and great grandson ; 
.widow ; daughter ; daughter's son : father ; mother ; full brother ; 
half brother; full brother's son; half brother's son. But the 
persons entitled to perform the sraddha of the deceased in order 
are somewhat different. In fact the order of succession does not 
strictly follow in any sohool the order of those that are called 
iraddhadhilcanns. The order of those who are entitled to offer 
sraddha to a deceased separated male ( iraddhadlukarm ) given 
in most works is as follows; son (aurasa or adopted); grand- 
son ; great-grandson ; widow ; married daughter ; unmarried 
daughter who has succeeded to the deceased's wealth ; daughter's 
son who succeeds to the wealth ; full brother ; half brother ( son 
of a different mother); full brother's son; half brother's son; 
father; mother; daughter-in-law; full sister; half Bister; full

son ; other gotraja sapindas ; sodaka; any gotraja ; cognates such 
as maternal grandfather, maternal uncle, maternal uncle's son 
(i. e. the bandhus of the three kinds in order); pupil ; son-in-law ; 
father-in-law ; friend ; any brahmana who takes a hrahmana's

of the offering of pindas regulating the right to succeed i B to 
be strictly and logically followed, there is no reason why the 
mother or the paternal grandmother should succeed immediate- 
ly after the father or the paternal grandfather respectively 
Her recognition in the D. B. school is due to the fact she is 
expressly mentioned in Manu as an heir. Similarly in the 
rules about the succession to re-united coparceners, the school 
of D. B. gives preference to re-united co-parceners and 
does not apply the theory of spiritual benefit. IPurther

to receive pinda or the capacity to participate in the pinda 
offered by* others ■ and not the actual offering of pradas. 
For example, if a man performs sraddha for his ancestors, 
then dies, but no one performs his sapindana and therefore 
he does not participate in the pindas given to his ancestors, 
still his wealth will be inherited on the principle of 
Teligious efficacy M31 Owing to considerations of space it is 
not possible to go into great detail about the several proposi- 
tions established in relation to, the theory of religious benefit 
as the determining factor in matters of inheritance. But the 
following propositions may be set out in one place: 

(1) ' Benefits are conferred on the deceased by means of thD 
ekoddista or the parmna baddha. The capacity to perform the 
parvana sraddha is not the sole ground on which rests the right 
to inheritance to a, man. Therefore the widow, the daughter 
and the pupil were recognized as heirs though they perform 
only the ekoddista sraddha. But those who are competent to 
perform the parvana sraddha have a preferable claim to those 
who are entitled to perform only the ekoddista sraddha There- 
fore the male issue of a deceased person are preferred to a 
widow or daughter. 

(2) Spiritual benefit is conferred on a man by presenting 
pinda directly to him or by offering pinda to one or more of his 
paternal ancestors to whom he presents pindas during his own 
life time and with whom he participates in pindas offered after 
his death by others or by offering a pinda to one or more of his 
maternal ancestors (mother's father, mother's fathers fatter 
and the latter's father ) to whom he was bound to offer pandas 
dnring his life (but with whom he does not participate in tne 
pinda offered to them 143 * ). 

(3) The pinda offered to a man himself directly is of greater 
efficacy than the pinda offered to a paternal ««*J»» ~

The Dayahh&ga, strarting with Baud. Dh. S, (1, 5. 113 ff), 
Manu (IX. 186-187 } and the MatsyapurSna elaborates its own 
definition in the following 143 ' way. A man's son and a daughter 
are both born in the family The daughter's son springa from 
the family of his maternal grandfather but he belongs to 
another gotra ( viz his own father's gotta ) ; similarly, a mail's 
sister ( i. e. father's daughter ) is born in his family but her son, 
though mediately sprung from the deceased owner's family, 
belongs to another gotra ( viz that of the sister's husband ) : the 
same is true' of a father's sister's son and the paternal 'grand- 
father's sister's son. A sister's son offers a pinda to the father

of the deceased, as the owner's father is the former's imbm-i

grandfather of the father's sister's son. A maternal unS So 

sprang even mediately from the family of the owner, but he 

offers a panda to his own father who is the maternal grandfather 

of the deceased owner. Therefore the maternal uncle or his son 

or sons son being connected with apindatbatis offered to the 

maternal grandfather or maternal great-grandfather respectively 

of the deceased owner is a sapioda of the deceased owner. A 

maternal aunt's son also offers a pinda to his mother's father, 

who is also the owner's mother's father and so the maternal 

aunt's son is a sapinda of the owner. The pindas offered to 

the maternal ancestors by him are inferior and secondary. 

Further, one's own mother, the father's mother, father's father's 

mother were associated with their respective husbands as to the 

pindas offered to the male ancestors and the same holds good 

about the wives of the maternal ancestors also. 1 ® 5 

The result of this way of defining a sapinda is to obliterate 
the distinction between a gotraja and a bandhu. Ysj (II 136) 
expressly says that a bandhu can succeed only on failure of all 
gotrajas and so according to him a bandhu is one who is not a 
gotraja. The DayabhSga brings in the sister's son immediately 
after the the brother's son's son and before the paternal grand- 
father (i. e. even before a near agnatic ancestor} who is 
literally a goltaja, while the sister's son is literally not a gotraja. 
When the DayabhSga designates one's sister's son as sprung 
from the kula of the owner though not of the same gotra, he 
does violence to popular usage prevalent throughout India. An 
ordinary person in India hardly ever says that his sister's son 
or father's sister's son is born in his own hula The Dayabhaga 
only quibbles over the word 'gotraja' inYaj which it reads in 
the singular ( gotrajah ) and not in the plural ( gotrajah ) as 
the Mit, does. Under the Mifc. the sister's son is only a bandhu 
and cannot succeed before a paternal uncle or his son or a 
paternal grand-uncle or any other gotraja. The DayabhSga 
thus gives the go-by to the text of Yaj and shuffles in several

cognates as very near heirs The D. B. regards Mami IX. 186- 
187 as the crucial text and-Yaj. 31. 135-36 as only secondary. 

The following diagrams will illustrate the working of the 
theory of religious efficacy. A person is a sapinda of those to 
whom he is bound to offer a pinda while he is alive, of those 
who on his death are bound to offer pinda to him ( viz his three 
male descendants, his daughter's son, his son's daughter's son 
and his son's son's daughter's son) and of those who are bound to 
offerapindato the ancestors to whom he is bound to offer a pinda 
viz. to his three paternal ancestors and his three maternal 
ancestors and all of these are his sapindas The last of these 
three groups has four sub-groups . — sub-group No. 1 comprises 
those who offer pindas to their own paternal ancestors who are 
also the paternal ancestors of the owner . sub-group II contains 
those who offer pindas to their three maternal ancestors who 
are all or some of them the paternal ancestors of the owner, to 
whom he was bound to offer a pinda; sub-group HI comprises 
those who offer pindas to their paternal ancestors all or some 
of whom are the maternal ancestors of the owner; sub-group IV 
exhibits those who offer pindas to their own maternal ancestors 
who are also the maternal ancestors of the owner. Each of 
these sub-groups contains 9 persons ( as the minimum ) who are 
all shown in thick type. If the owner has several brothers, 
sisters, uncles and aunts &c. the number of possible sapindas 
will be much larger. All heirs in the three sub-groups H-IV 
will be bandhus according to the Mitaksara and will be post- 
poned to gotrajas undeT the Mitaksara. It should be noticed 
that Jlmutavahana brought in the father's daughter's son 
immediately after the father's great-grandson, the paternal 
grandfather's daughter's son after the paternal grandfather's 
great-grandson and the paternal great-grandfather's daughter's 
son immediately after that ancestor's great-grandson on the 
analogy of the rights of the owner's daughter's son and on the 
basis of Manu IX 139 that the daufutm ( daughter's son ) saves 
an ancestor in the next world just as a son's son does. 1 * 6

these details as its two verses ( IX 186-187) were quite enougl 
to lead to all that has been 'elaborated by the D. B about th.

It will have been noticed that no female except the hv< 
expiessly mentioned can inherit under the Dayabhaga scheme 
and the result is that a man's own son's daughter or daughter' 
daughter does not take as heir, whereas a distant-rolativo like th 
father's father's lister's sou takes it. The same is also the cn« 
even under the Mitaksaia in the whole of India ( oveept m 
Bombay and to some extent in Madras for which see a little 
later on ) 

A man offers only the leavings or remnants of the pindas 
that stick to his hand (when offering pindas to hit three 
paternal ancestors ) and that ( leavings ) aie cast on knsa gw* 
to three paternal ancestors above the paternal greal-grandfaUior

the D. B. 14B ( XI. 1. 38 ) According to D. B sakulyas succeed 
after all sapindas are exhausted Just as a man participates 
after Mb death in the pindas offered to his paternal ancestors 
so he •would participate in the leavings also offered to his 
paternal ancestors from the 4th to 6th by their descendants 
( from 4th to 6th ) The D B. remarks that this difference 
between sapindas and sakulyas is made only in the matter of 
inheritance But in the matter of the periods of mourning 
both the sapindas { stiictly so called in the section on inherit- 
ance) and the sakulyas aie designated sapindas by Manu 
( V. 60 ) and by the Markandeya-piuana { 28. 4 ). 1410 According 
to Manu IX. 187 sahvlyas succeed on failure of sapindas, while 
Visnu Dh S ( XVII. 9-11 ) prescribes 1441 that on failure of 
bandhus, sakulyas succeed It appears that Visnu employs the 
word bandhu in the sense of sapinda Nar (dayabhaga, 51) states 
that on failure of daughters and sakulyas, bandhavas and 
persons of the same caste succeed Here it appears that sakulya 
and baudhava are employed in the sense of gofaaja and 
bandhava as done in Yaj. The Balambhatti says that gotraja and 
sakulya are synonymous. The Dayabhaga appears to be some- 
what inconsistent in its references to sakulyas. In XI. 6 15 
and 33 it includes samanodakas among sakulyas, while in XI. 
6 %1-2-Z it defines sakulya as stated above. The Mit. on the 
other hand comprehends the sakulyas of the D. B. (as defined 
m XI 6, 21 ) under its gotraja sapindas

The Mit. states that the gotrajas are the paternal grand- 
mother, the sapindas and samSnodakas of the deceased. It then 
proceeds to say that the paternal grandmother is the firat 
among gotrajas, then comes paternal grandfather. It para- 
phrases the word gotraja ( born in the gotra ) as samanaqolra 
( having the same gotra ) and then proceeds, ' on failure of the 
father's line { sanla-na ) the heirs are the paternal grandmother, 
the paternal grandfather, the paternal uncles and their sons in 
order ; on failure of the paternal grandfather's line the paternal 
great-grandmother, the paternal great-grandfather, his sons 
and son's sons inherit. In this manner must be understood the 
succession of sapindas belonging to the same gotra ( as the 
deceased) up to the 7th degree'. According to the Mit. sapinda 
relationship extends up to the 7th degree ( reckoned from and 
inclusive of the owner) Therefore the owner's sapindas for 
purposes of inheritance according to the Mit. are the owner's 
(1) 6 male descendants in the male line, (2) 6 male ascendants 
in the male line and the wives of the first three of them { that 
are expressly so declared, viz. mother, paternal grandmother 
and paternal great-grandmother) and probably the wives of 
the next three also, (3) the six male descendants of each of his 
six male ascendants in the collateral male lines. Besides, a 
man's wife and daughter are treated as his sapindas and the 
daughter's son, though a blnnnaqolra sapinda, is placed high 
among the gotraja sapinda heirs 

Even under the MitaksarS in the whole of India { except 
in the Bombay and Madras schools), no women succeed as 
gotraja sapindas ( except five expressly named and cited t*mt 
on p. 713 ). In Bombay the sister (full or half ) is hrough 
"asagoUa by the V May'akha (though the JMjJ»»

widow and mother are not gotrajas(in this sense of being born in 
the gotra) hut on marriage they enter the gotra of their husbands 
and become sagotra Further, on the same reasoning, a son s 
daughter, brother's daughter, father's sister and other women born 
in the family of the deceased will become his gotrajas (though not 
sagotras because on marriage they pass into the gotra of their 
husbands) But these other women are not expressly recognised 
even by the V. Mayukha as gotrajas. Even though she was not 
mentioned in the Mit the sister has been recognised as a gotraja 
sapinda by the Bombay High Couit in parts of the Bombay 
Presidency where the Mit. is the paramount authority. The 
order of heirs under the Mit would be as follows :— Full brother, 
half brothei, full brothel's son, half brothel's son, paternal 
grandmother, sister, (full being prefeived to half), paternal 
grandfather. According to the V. Mayukha the order is slightly 
different, viz full hrothers along with tons of full brothers 
that are dead, full brother's faon, grandmother, full sister, 
halfbiother, halfsister, paternal grandfather. The unmarried 
sister had been recogniaed as entitled to a share when brothers 
came to a partition and they had to provide for her marriage 
expenses Vide ahove pp 619-630 and Nar 1143 ( dayabhaga, 13 ), 
Visnu Dh. S. 18. 35, Manu IX. 118, Ya3 II. 124. In Madras the 
sister had been recognized as a bandhu The Legislature has 
intervened and laid down ( Hindu Law of Inheritance Amend- 
ment Act II of 1929 ) that in territories governed by the law of 
the Mitaksara and in respect of the property of males not held 
in coparcenary and not disposed by. will, a son's daughter, 
daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son shall be entitled to 
rank as heirs in the order specified in the Act next after a 
father's father and before a father's brother The first three of 
these were before this Act not at all recognized as heirs in the 
whole of India except in Bombay ( where the sister was recog- 
nised as a gotraja sapinda and the first two as bandhus ) and 
except in Madras ( where the first three were recognized only 
as bandhus ). The sister's son was given a very high place as a 
sapinda under the Dayabhaga and was treated as a bandhu 
elsewhere in India. This enactment does not affect the Daya- 
bhaga scheme and so the three females mentioned in the Act 
are not heirs even now under the Dayabhaga The sister's 
place as settled by Bombay decisions is after the paternal

grandmother and before the paternal grandfather, while the 
above Act places her after the paternal grandfather. In Bai 
Mahataxtm i> The Deputy Na<u 45 Bom. L, R. 434 it has for this 
reason been held that the Act does not apply to the Bombay 
Province. Jf it be held that the Act does apply to Bombay 
( except as to the sister ), then the same Act will have to be 
deemed to be laying down two different orders of succession as 
to the same four heirs in different provinces, which, to say the 
least, is not a reasonable or desirable way of interpreting 
statutes (just as in the case of texts). 

Some difficulty is caused by the use of the word saxtamt in 
the Mit. as legards the father's, giandfather's and great-grand- 
fatber's line. It has been seen above (p 731 ) that the compact 
series ends with the brother's son (father's son's son i. e after 
two descendants of the father ) according to the Bombay High 
Court, while elsewhere in India it is supposed to end with the 
brothel's son's son ( i, e after three descendants of the father). 
The Mit expressly mentions only two descendants in the grand- 
father's and gieat-grandfather's line. The general rule is that 
sapmda relationship extends to six descendants of each line 
(excluding the man oi ancestor from whom the counting is 
made ) The further general rule gathered from the meagre 
words of the Mit. is that the nearer line excludes the moTe 
remote ( e. g. the grandfather, his son and grandson are expresB- 
ly mentioned by the Mit. as taking before the great-grand- 
father, his son and grandson ). The question is whether the 3rd, 
4th, 5th and 6th descendants of a nearer line would exclude 
even the 1st or 2nd descendant of a remoter line e g whether 
the great-grandson of the grandfather would take before U» 
son or grandson ,of the greafc-grand-father or whether the Mm 
descendant of the grandfather would take before the son of m 
great-grandfather. There were three views"" on to point-

for the three v«ms and their expounders. The t . < Z «• |0

for the same view. 



HI] • Three views about qohajn mc<xs«wn 751 

The first view, lelying upon certain words of the Sin' C, held 
that,after two descents in each line, one should ascend' into .1 
remoter line and after the two descendants ■ of that line are 
exhausted, one should revert to the 3id to 6th descendants, "of a 
nearer.lme The 2nd view was that in each line three 'genevif- 
tions were to he first exhausted, because the word pud<r in 
several places in the Mit.includes-the tin ee male descendants^ 
The 3rd view w4s was that in each line" six descendants weic to 
he exhausted before 'ascending to the next 'remoter line ( a<* 
Bapinda relationship extended to six 'degrees.) •> - - 1 

Another question is whether the 'widows' of agnatic relations 
(such as the son's widow, brother's -widow, step-mothev "or 
paternal uncle's widow) are 'included in the 'toi'm ' gqhajah ' 
for pmposes of inheritance Under tlie Dayabhaga, as well 
as under the Mitaksara throughout India '(except in 'the 
Bombay School ), the widows of gotraja sapindas are not heiis 
at all, since according to almost all writers . women do not 
inherit except when expressly mentioned by ■ itexts i In , the 
Bombay School the position is different. According to -both 
the Mit and the Mayukha. wives enter by marriage the gqtra 
of their husbands and become sapindas of their husbands. The 
Balambhattt declared the son's widow to-be an ■ heir-.^even 
before the paternal .grandmother and includes females also in 
the word goltajuh When got} aja was rendered as santixnaqotnit, 
the term became wide-enoughrnot only to include those 'born in 
the gotra but even those who entered .the gotra by mariiage. 
Besides, it was argued that if the paternal grandmother oi 
paternal great-grandmother succeeded as a gotraja theie was, no 
reason why other widows of otheT gofaaoas should not succeed. 
From the earliest days of British rule the* gotraja sapindas 
( such as the son's, hiother's, paternal uncle's Widows ) have' 
been recognized as heirs in the Bombay Presidency, Tliey take 
only a limited estate like the owner's widow or mother or

Samanodakas According to the Mit gotrajas are either 
sapindas or samanodakas. The word 'samanodaka' ha<! a 
technical meaning Ace, to Manu V.60, 'the sapinda relationship 
ceases with the seventh person, the relationship of samanodaka 1 " 8 
ends when birth ( in the family ) and name are no longer 
known'. This occurs in the chapter on impurity. The Mit 
declares that the samanodakas comprise males seven generations 
beyond the sapindas or all males ( beyond sapmdas) whoso 
birth ( in the same family as that of the deceased ) and name 
are known. It quotes a text of Brhan-Manu, 'the sapinda 
relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relation of

B amanodaka ceases after the 14th ; according to somo it extends 
as fat as the memory of name and family (or birth) reach, 
the gotra is said to extend up to that*. The eamanodakas 
comprise the 7 ascendants of a person after the great-grand- 
father's great-grandfather, the 13 descendants of these seven 
ascendants, the 7 descendants after the 6th descendant of his 
6 male ancestors from his own father; and descendants of 
himself from the 7th to the 13th. The Privy Council have 
ruled 1449 in a recent case that, according to the Mitaksara 
school, samanodaka relationship does not extend beyond the 
14th degree (from and inclusive of the common ancestor of the 
claimant and the propositus). 

The word* samanodaka ' literally means ' those who offer to 
or receive water from the same person \ The word is employed 
by Vas. 14s0 17. 79. But in the law of inheritance it has a 
technical meaning as stated above.

or Baudhayana. They may be translated as follows: 'The 
sons of one's father's sister, the sons of one's mother's sister 
and the sons of one's maternal uncle — these are to be known 
as fflniabandlrus ( one's own bandhus ) ; the sons of one's father's 
father's sister, the sons of one's father's mother's sister, the 
son's of one's father's maternal uncle — these are to be known 
as one's pitrbandhus ( father's bandhus ) , the sons of one's 
mother's father's sister, the sons of one's mother's mother's 
sister, the sons of one's mother's maternal uncle — these are to 
be known as the mBtitoandhua ( mother's bandhus ). M52 The Mit. 
states on this text that bandhus are of three kinds viz. atma- 
bandhus, pitrbandhus and matrbandhus and that atmabandhus 
succeed before pitrbandhus on account of their greater propin- 
quity to the deceased and pitrbandhus succeed before the 
matrbandhus 11S3 The treatment of the rights of bandhus in 
the Mit and other commentaries and digests is very meagre. 
This has led in modern times to a bewildering mass of case law 
on the inheritance of bandhus. 

The first question is whether the enumeration of bandhus in 
the verses quoted is exhaustive or only illustrative. The V. P. 
expressly 1451 states that if the enumeration be held to be 
exhaustive absurd results would follow. For example, a 
maternal uncle's son is expressly named as an atmabandhu in 
the verses quoted above, but his father ( the maternal uncle )> 
being not mentioned, would on that hypothesis be excluded. 
Therefore it was held by the Privy Council in a very early- 
case us> that the enumeration of bandhus is only illustrative, 
that the maternal uncle though not mentioned is a nearer

bandhu and would succeed in preference to his own son wl 
is expressly mentioned. In Balasubrahmanya v. SuWmjya 65 
A. 93 it was held that under the MitSksara the principle t 
proximity of blood relationship applies to the succession o 
bandhue, that in determining which of two Stmabandhus is entit 
led to succeed nearness of degree and not religious efficacy is tbi 
proper test to apply, that when the Stmabandhus are equal k 
degree the test of religious efficacy may be applied to determine 
preference and that the maternal uncle of the deceased is 
entitled to preference over the deceased's father's half sister's 
son. This was followed in Virangauda v. Yellappa I. L R (1943) 
Bom. 359 ( F. B, ) where the mother's brother of the deceased 
was preferred to' the father's sister's son. So also the mother^ 
father would be a bandhu. It is strange that the deceased^ 
own descendants through a female or the deceased's father's 
descendants through a female such as the son's daughters son, 
daughter's son's son, daughter's daughter's son, sister's son 
or sister's daughter's son, are not mentioned in any authoritative 
commentaries or digests as his bandhm. Further, the bandhus 
enumerated in the three verses do not go beyond the 4th degree 
from the common ancestor. But bandhu relationship extends 
up to five degrees at least. There is an ancient instance of the 
sister's daughter's son having succeeded to a Buddhist bhhsn 
in Cambodia ( in sake 586 ). This would be so only according 
to the principles of the Mit. Vide ' Indian Cultural Influence 
in Cambodia ' p 55 by Dr. Bijan Baj Chatterji ( Cal.1928 ), Ml 
the above (such as the son's daughter's son) have been 
recognized by the Indian Courts as stmabandhus entitled »

through their mother or father. These propositions were accepted 
by the Privy Council, 1457 which further said that sapxnda rela- 
tionship extends in the case of bandhus only up to five degrees. 
The first proposition about mutuality has some support m the 
interpretation put on the famous verse of Manu IX. 187 by the 
BalambhattI and the Subodhinl ( vide above note 1418). But 
difficulty is created about mutuality by the unwarranted 
assumption that the common ancestor must be a member of 
one out o£ four families as stated by Sarvadhikari. The other 
propositions, however, are not supported by any texts^ or sound 
reasoning. Since the enumeration of bandhus is admitted to be 
not exhaustive, no sound inference can be drawn from the list 
of nine bandhus that a heritable bandhu must be connected 
with the deceased in any particular way All that can be 
required is that he must be a bandhu as defined by the 
Mit ana connected with the deceased by having particles 
of the body of a common ancestor within the limits of 
sapinda relationship as laid down by the Mit. The limit of five 
degrees categorically laid down by the P. O is not, it is sub- 
mitted with great respect, based on very sure or strong founda- 
tions. The Mit says that sapinda relationship extends to seven 
degrees when traced through the father, that wherever the word 
' sapinda * is employed this meaning has to be understood and 
it extends up to five degrees when traced through the mother.

dhikari (T. L. L. p 6306E) is not right in inferring from the nine bandhus

a descendant of a common ancestor who is a member of the following fami-

person about whose Bapindaship a question is raised traces Ms

his mother. In the P. G. case the claimant claimed sapinda- 
ship with the deceased through his mother, and it was rightly 
decided that he being 6th from the common ancestor was not

degree from the common ancestor in the case of bhinnagotra 
sapindas may he 'found "in 'the words of Mitaamisra in his 
commentary on Yaj'l. 52, in the implication of the words of 
Kulluka 1459 on Manu V. 60 and in the remarks of the 
BilambhattI ( p 191 ). But this' view is opposed to other 
weighty authorities such as the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharma- 
sindhu 

The whole law about the succession of bandhus is in a 
confused state owing to conflicting decisions, but the, P.,0. has 
laid down certain propositions which may be set down here : 
(1) atmabandhas succeed before pitrbandhus and pitrbandhus 
before matrbandhus ; (51) the nearer in degree in each class of 
bandhus is preferable to the more remote ; (3) as between bandhus 
of the same class, the conferring of spiritual benefit would be 
a ground of preference, as the Yiramitrodaya invokes that 
principle m several cases ( and so the father's half sister's son 
would be preferred to the mother's sister's son, though both axe 
atmabandhus and of equal degree );' (4) if the above three rules 
fail, bandhus ex parte paterna ( on the father's side ) succeed 
before bandhus ex parte materna (onthe mother's side); (5) the 
bandhu between whom and the propositus a lesser number of 
females intervenes is to be preferred. As a corollary of the 2nd 
rule it should follow, that the descendants of the propositus 
would be preferred to ascendants and collaterals and that ban- 
dhusof the same class that are descendants of a nearer line 
would succeed in preference to descendants of a remoter line 
though of the same class. But this last proposition has not yet 
been settled by the Pnvy Council. It has been, however, held in 
Debt Uas »M»*f Belmn LL.B (1943) All. 131 that a sister's 
sons son should be preferred to the deceased's cousin's daugh- 
ter s son, since the former belongs to a nearer line.

bandhus. One or two matters, however, call for remark. If the 
theory of spiritual benefit be strictly applied, many of those 
who would inherit as bandhus under the Mit. system would be 
barred from inheritance. For example, the daughter's son's 
son" 5 '" or daughter's daughter's son would be a heritable bandhu 
under the Mitaksara, but under the Bsyabbsga he would not be 
so, as he offers no pinda to the deceased or to any of the latter's 
ancestors. It is probably to obviate this unnatural and unjust 
consequence that the Dayatattva refers to the text of Br. (quoted 
above in n 1419) in which the word 'bandhavah' occurs, 
remarks that the relatives of the father and mother of (the 
deceased ) inherit in the order of their nearness to the latter and 
quotes the three verses about the three classes of bandhus, 
indicating thereby that spiritual benefit is not the sole test, 
but that where it fails the test of blood relationship may 
be applied." 60 

Very elaborate rules have been evolved by Sarvadhikan in 
his Tagore Law Lectures on the Hindu Law of inheritance {2nd 
ed. of 1932, pp. 571-640). The author devoted great industry, labour 
and ingenuity in evolving those rules. But one regrets to say 
that he raised a stupendous structure on very slippery and 
meagre foundations And the pity of it is that many Judges 
have more or less followed his lead, though emphatic disapproval 
of his views, whereby the list of bandhus capable of ™ en ™f 
has been very much restricted, has not been wanting. 1 ' it « 
not possible to examine here in detail his reasonings andresulte. 
But the futility of much that he has evolved can and must be 
briefly shown. The only solid foundations that we have in fbs 
Mit. are : (1 ) the definition of sapinda given by it onY&j 1» 
(3) the remark that bandhus are bhinnagotra sapindas > (as 
contrasted wiHi gotrajas); (3) that the bandhus of a man maybe 
described under three classes; (4) that those that may be calkd 
Shandhus succeed before those called »*J«Jtaj ««*-

HI ) Saroadhikari's scheme of bandhu succession 761 

the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses of §alatapa or Baudba- 
yana are only illustrative. Therefore, the nine bandhus ex- 
pressly mentiond Bhould not have been used to exclude aDy one 
as not a heritable bandhu, as we have not got anywhere an 
exhaustive enumeration Any one who satisfied the first two 
requirements stated above was a bandhu. Of the nine bandhus 
enumerated in the verses quoted above, none is connected by 
direct descent with the propositus, his father or mother; but one 
is a descendant of his paternal grandfather, one of his paternal 
great-grandfather, two of his maternal grandfather, two of 
hiB father's maternal grandfather, one of his mother's paternal 
grandfather, two of his mother's maternal grandfather. Sarva- 
dhikari makes a different classification of these ( p. 627 ) viz. 
' two are connected through the father, three through the mother, 
two through the paternal grandmother ' and two through the 
maternal grandmother '. The whole trouble has been caused by 
this latter grouping. Instead of emphasizing lines of direct 
descent, he catches hold of females who are never spoken of in 
ancient works in connection with tracing descent ( except in the 
case of the mother of the man concerned ). If, because the 
illustrations given happen to be connected only with four lines 
of families, persons connected with the propositus through other 
lines are to be excluded, there is no reason why a man's own 
daughter's son's son, son's daughter's son, Bister's son, or sister's 
son's son should be held to be bandhus. They bear no close 
analogy to the atmabandhus enumerated by Satatapa. But it is 
admitted by Sarvadhikari that they are atmabandhus. The terms 
atmabandhu, pitrbandhu and matrbandhu are mere labels or 
devices to show nearness and preference among bandhus. Ace.

or matuh bandbavah) i. e. according to it pitrbandhus or 
matrbandhus are bandhus of the father or mother and must also 
be bandbus of the propositus if they are to inherit It is not 
known in what context the three verses quoted in the Mifc. and 
other digests from Satatapa or Baudhayana occurred. In Manu 
V. 81 it is laid down that one should observe mourning on 
the death of a pupil, sacrificial priest and bandhavas for the 
duration of pdkstnl. It ia possible that the three verses only 
illustrate what is meant by bandhavas in such a connection. 

The BalambbattI ( vyavahara p. 214 ) here also explains 
that females are included in the word ' bandhu *, although tho 
verses quoted speak of 'putrah* only and the Bombay and 
Madras High Courts have allowed female bandhus to inherit, 
though in Madras the position assigned to female bandhus is 
very much lower than in Bombay. 

Strongei-a as Hetis— In default of even bandhus, the Mit 
states 14 * 3 that the teacher (of the veda)is the heir of the deceased, 
in default of the teacher the pupil (and relies on £.p. Dh. S B. 6. 
14.3) and that in default of pupil a sabvhmacaiin (fellow 
student whose upanayana was performed by the same teacher as 
that of the deceased and who studied the veda under tho same 
teacher)"" inherits. In the absence of even a tellow student 
the wealth of a brahmana was to be given to some irofriya (a 
brahmana learned in the Veda ) as laid down by Gaut ( 28. 39) 
and in default of a srotriya in the same village, as said i by tho 
Dayabhaga XI 6. 27, to any brahmana, since Manu (IX. 188-1SJJ 
Bays, 'in the absence of all (heirs), brahmanos that have 
studied the three vedas, that are pure and restrained, take tho 
wealth ; in this way dharma does not suffer : the rule is i that the 
wealth of a brahmana should never be taken by tho king-

sudras escheats to the king in default of heirs np to a fellow 
student. When the king takes by escheat heirless property he 
has to set apart a portion of the wealth of the deceased for the 
maintenance of his concubines and servants and for the per- 
formance of his funeral rites and araddhas as stated by Kat M69 
931. Kaut HL 5, Har. (dayabhaga, 52) provide that the king (when 
he takes heirless property ) should provide maintenance for bis 
women and both the Mit. and the V. Mayukha explain that 
the word * women ' stands for aoaruddhastri ( exclusively kept 
concubine) and not for his wives ( who would succeed as heirs 
and then there would be no escheat), because the word 
'patnV is not employed in the verse. These verses of ITSr. 
and Est. are the foundation of the right to maintenance of a 
concubine against the heirs of the deceased paramour in modern 
times. 1 "

Ysj. (EL 137) states a special rule 1W1 which is an exception to 
the general rule of inheritance laid down in II. 135-136 viz. 
' ( the heirs } who take the wealth of a forest hermit, a ga/t 
(ascetic), a ( perpetual )vedio student are inorder the (vedic) 
teaoher, a virtuous pupil, one who is looked upon as a brother 
and belongs to the same order '. According to the Mit. the 
heirs mentioned are to be taken in> the reverse order of the 
words of the text i, e. the acarya ( who is mentioned first among 
the three heirs ) Is to be taken as the heir of the last of the 
three mentioned in the first half of the verse, so that the teacher, 
good .pupil and the person looked upon as brother are respec- 
tively" the heirs of the perpetual student, the ascetic and the 
forest hermit. According to the Dayabhaga also the reverse 
order has to be taken, but it says that the wealth of the forest 
hermit, yati and perpetual student is taken respectively by odb 
looked upon as brother, a worthy pupil and teaeher, but that 
in the absence of these, any one who is in the same asrama as 
the deceased may take it According to the Madanaratna"' 2 
the order of heirs is the direct one, that is, the teacher, good 
pupil and accepted brother take the wealth of the forest hermit, 
ascetic and perpetual student, since the Visnu Dh. S. (17, 15-18) 
expressly says bo. The Mit. adds that a brahmacSrin is of two 
kinds viz. perpetual ( ma§tht!ca ) , and upakurvSya ( who intends 
to remain as a student for some time and then marry in order 
to confer the benefit of male progeny on his ancestors), that

Ya)5avalkya's words apply only to the former, that if the latter 
( upakurvana ) leaves any wealth of his own it is taken hy his 
mother, fatheT and the other heirs- The Mit. further says that 
a worthy pupil is one who is capable of studying the philosophical 
parts of the Veda, of understanding them and of acting up to 
them, that a badly behaved pupil will not succeed, bo also a 
badly conducted teacher shall not succeed. The Mit explains 
that Yaj HE 47 allowed a forest hermit to accumulate materials 
that will be enough to meet his needs for a day, a month or 
six months or a year and so he may on his death leave some 
wealth Similarly, though an ascetic was required by Gautama 
( HI. 10 ) to make no accumulation of wealth, yet even an 
ascetic requires clothes to cover his body, he has his sandals 
and books on Yoga and the like ; and so also the perpetual 
student requires these. 

The heirs enumerated above succeed to persons in those 
religious orders in priority of their kindred. It has been held 
that members of> the three twice-born classes alone can be 
ascetics with the result that tbeir pupils inherit and not the 
kindred and that in the case M73 of sudra ascetics their kindred 
succeed unless some usage to the effect that a pupil inherits is 
proved. For the foundation and administration of matkas and 
properties attached to them, the selection of the heads of matbas 
and their powers and duties and about ascetics and their pupils, 
vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 906-914 and pp, 944-952. 

Reunion. — A reunion properly so called can take place only 
between those who were parties to the original partition. 
Reunion, therefore, postulates three stages, viz. (1) joint family, 
(2) partition between members of a joint family, (3) an inten- 
tion and an agreement, express or implied, to reunite in estate 
among members who were parties to the partition. If persons 
who had separated in interest merely stay together, that is not

tho ordinary law at succession applies to a sudra ascetic ) ; Ramdas v,

tory of Slate 44 Mad. 704 (holding that the disciple of a sndra ascetic who

reunion in law, as said by the Sm. O. JL p. 302 and Vivada- 

candra 1 * 7 * p. 82. The Vivadacandra quoting VisnupurSna saya 

that reunion may be implied from a course of conduct, even 

though an express agreement cannot be proved. There iBa 

divergence of views as to who can reunite. The Mit., the 

Day&bhaga ,47S , the Sm. C. hold, literally construing a verse of 

Br. { S. B. E. 33 p. 381 verse 72 ), that a member of a joint family 

when once divided can reunite only with his father, brother or 

paternal uncle, but not with any other relation (such as a 

paternal uncle's son or paternal grand-father), while the V. G. 

( p. 157 ), the V. MayQkha (p. 146 ), the V. P. ( p. 533 ) hold that 

the members expressly mentioned by Br. are only illustrative 

and that a person may reunite with any member who was a 

party to the original partition. A reunited person is called 

samsrsta or sarhsrstin U76 (who has reunited wealth). The 

subject of reunion has a comparatively ancient history. Gaut. 

28. 26 states the general rule that on the death of a reunited 

co-parcener the surviving reunited member succeeds to the 

share of the deceased Kaut. (HL 5 p. 160) states" 77 that those, 

who live together though they may have no ancestral estate or 

do so after dividing their ancestral estate, may divide their 

reunited estate again in equal shares. Manu IX. 210 ( =Visnu 

Dh. S 18. 41 ) is Bimilar to it.

Devolution after reunion 767 



The verseB of Ysj. <H- 138-139 ) i47a on succession to a 
deceased reunited person are understood by the Mit. to be au 
exception to the rules contained in Yaj II. 135-136 laying down 
that the wife and others inherit the property of a person dying 
sonless. Therefore it follows that where a person reunites 
with his brother and then dies leaving a son not reunited with 
him, it is the son, who will inherit and not the brother, though 
reunited But if A separates from two sons B and O of whom 
B reunites with him and O doeB not and then A dies, then the 
reunited son B succeeds to A's interest and O takes nothing. 
This is expressly stated by the Yivadacandra p. 85 that relies 
on the Srnrtisara 1479 . The two verses of Yaj ( II. 138-139 ) 
are variously read, and interpreted by the Mit. and other 
commentators and it is not possible nor quite necessary to set 
out all these readings and explanations. Ace. to the Mit 
the two verses, mean: 'in the case of a deceased reunited per- 
son, the (surviving) reunited member should give (to the 
posthumous son of the former ) the share of the deceased but 
may take it himself if there is no son ( but only a wife ) ; but 
from among the reunited brothers, the full brother, if reunited, 
should similarly give to the posthumous son of the deceased 
the latter's share and ( if there be no son ) he should take 
it himself to the exclusion of reunited half brothers ; a re- 
united half brother takeB the wealth of the deceased reunited 
member (dying Bonless) and not another half brother who 
ib not reunited; a full brother, though not reunited, may 
take the wealth along with a half brother who is reunited 
but the latter will not alone be entitled '. In this interpreta- 
tion the word * asamsrstl ' in the latter half of II. 139 has 
to be taken in two connections, once with ' anyodaryah ' in 
the first half and then again with ' samsrstah '■ ( in the 2nd 
half ). This last word is to be understood in two senseB, viz.

(1) full brother (with the preceding word asamsrsti) and (a) 
reunited ( with the word ' anyamatrjah ' ). Further, aoo. to the 
Mifc. we have to understand 'era' after * anyamatrjah \ Apararka 
{£ 748) reads differently and he, VisvarGpa and Srfkarahiisra 
(DayabbSga XI. 5-16) explain that a full brother though not 
reunited takes the whole esfcatB and not the half brother though 
reunited with the deceased. The V. Mayukha differs from the 
Mit. when it says that the word apulias?/a (of one dying sonless) 
is not to be understood with Yaj (II 138). It derives two 
propositions from the first half of Yaj E. 138, viz (1) the wealth 
of one dying reunited is taken by the surviving reunited 
member or members ; (2) in a competition between reunited 
full brother and reunited half-brother, the former takes the 
whole. The latter half of II. 138 is an independent sentence 
(and not joined with the preceding half as the Mit. understands) 
and applies where a reunited member dies leaving a wife who 
is pregnant but that fact being unknown the other reunited 
members divide the estate. In such a case if a son is born the 
surviving members should hand over to the son the share of 
the deceased reunited member. But if no such son is born then 
the survivors may take the estate. In II. 139 the Mayukha 
holds that the words ' anyodarya " and ' anyamatrja ' are not 
restricted to brothers only, but apply to a paternal uncle or hia 
sons or other persons who were reunited, because their mother 
is also different from the mother of the deceased The Daya- 
fahaga discusses Yaj H. 138-139 under the topic of succession 
to the separate property of a sonless man and its treatment of 
succession to reunited property is very meagre ( vide XH ) M6 ° 
The V. P. p. 533 notices this and levels against JlmutavShana 
the criticism that he got confused. Aparfrka (pp. 748-749) seems 
to be of the same opinion as the Dayabhaga. The V. F. follows 
the Mit. and criticizes the explanation given by Srikara, Sm. O 
and others ( pp. 535-538 ). It says that the texts of Sankha, 
Narada and others conflict with the text of Yaj. II 135 and that 
the order of heirs as to a reunited co-parcener is based on express 
texts and not on Yaj, H. 135 Msl or logical reasoning. Accord- 
ing to the V. P. the order of succession to a deceased reunited 

1480. x$* jtatt^mafFmtemfrrt BrsfSrarwrar* toiPrj *«#

person seems to be: (1-3) son, grandson, great-grandBon ; (4) 
reunited full brother ; (5) reunited half brother and separated 
full brother; (6) reunited mother; (7) reunited father ; (8) any 
other reunited member; (9) half brother not reunited; (10) 
mother not reunited; (11) father not reunited; (12) widow! 
(13) daughter; (14) daughter's son; (15) sister. The V. Mayu- 
kha gives the order as follows: (1) Bon if reunited, (2) son 
not reunited, though there may be reunited members (other 
than a son); (3) the parents if reunited in preference to other 
reunited persons (other than a son); (4) full brother if re- 
united ; (5) full brother not reunited and half brother reunited ; 
(6) half brothers and uncles, if reunited ; (7) other male mem- 
bers reunited (in preference to wife though she be reunited); 
(8) wife if she be reunited ; (9) full sister (or daughter accord- 
ing to another reading ); 1482 (10) any other sapinda who is 
nearest. It is to be noted that Manu IX. 212 prescribes a 
peculiar rule of succession for reunited co-parceners viz. that 
full brothers (not reunited) and full sisters of the deceased 
reunited co-parcener equally inherit along with half brothers 
that are reunited the wealth of the deceased. This verse of 
Manu has been variously explained by Kulluka, Apararka 
p. 749, Sm. O. ( H pp 304-305 ), Nllakaniha, Vivadacandra 
(p. 83 ) and others. 

It may be Btated here that cases of reunion come very 
rarely before the courts.

CHAPTER XXX 
STRIDBANA 

i>h hlhana ( woman's property ). This subject abounds with 
differing views on several topics that fall under it, as will be 
feeejj below 

The gorms of the topic of strldbana can be traced to the 
Vodic Literature. As Sir Gooroodas Bannerjee remarks (in 
' Marriage and Slrldhana ' p 370 ), ' nowhere were proprietary 
rights of women recognized so early as in India; and in very' 
few ancient systems of law have these rights been so largely 
conceded as in our own '. The wedding hymn in the Bgved» 
(X. 85 ) contains two verses* 483 { 13 and 38 ) which indicate 
that gifts were sent to the bridegroom's house with the bride. 
They are . ' the bridal gifts of SfiryS that Savitr sent off have 
gone forth; in the Aghas ( Magha constellation ) are struck the 
kine and in the Arjunls (Phalguni constellation) is carried 
(the bridal gift); for thee in the beginning they carried about 
Burya together with the bridal gifts &o.\ Ssyana explains 
' vahatu ' as ' cows and other objects given for pleasing the 
girl to be married ', while Lanman ( Harvard O series vol. Till 
v 753) renders it as 'bridal caT'. Sayana's interpretation 
suits the context much better. In the Tai. S 71 Z. 1 1 we 
read, 1 * 8 * 'the wife (of the saorificer) holds on (to the cart), 
for the wife is the mistress of the household gear '. Mami IX. 
11 uses the word « pawnahya * ( household gear ) and states that 
the wife should be entrusted among other matters with tae 
eupervisian over it. Jaimini "* 5 , according to Sabara, refer s to

Ill ] Evolution of woman's property 771 

this passage of the Tai. S. for establishing that women do own 
certain property. Medhatithi 148S on Manu VD3 416 (cited 
above on p 452) quotes this passage of the Tai S. and argues that 
if Manu YU3 416 ( saying that whatever a wife earns is her 
husband's ) were literally understood passages like the one in 
Tai. S would have no scope and that therefore Manu simply 
means that though women may he owners they ,oannot dispose 
of the property independently It appears from these ancient 
passages that the properties, which in early days were held to 
be owned by women, were presents made at the time of marriage 
{ such as ornaments and costly dresses ) and household articles 
that aTe generally under the control of women and that the 
later smrti rules about the devolution of strldhana in the female 
line arose from the peculiar nature of the articles over which 
dominion was conceded to women This early state of things 
is indicated by some of the early sutras. Up Dh ""g ( jj g. 
14.9) states the view of some predecessors (which iLp himself 
does not approve) that the ornaments belong to the wife and also 
such wealth as came to her from her agnates ( father, brother 
&c ). Baud. Dh S. H Z. 49 says that daughters get the orna- 
ments of their mother and whatever else it is customary for 
them to get. Vas 17. 46 prescribes that women ( daughters ) 
should divide the nuptial presents given to their mother. 
Sankha ( q by Sam. Pr. p. 851 ) prescribes that in all forms of 
marriage ornaments and strldhana should be given to the girl 
It may be that Manu VHI 416 only gives expression to an 
ancient opinion, that the literal meaning of that verse was 
given up long before and that all that Manu meant was that 
during coverture a woman was subject to the control of the 
husband as regards her strldhana. 

Three principal topics have to be discussed under strldhana 
viz what constitutes strldhana, woman's dominion over her

strldhana and inheritance to strldhana. On each one of these 
topios great diversity of views prevails and the subject has 
become very complicated, as the DayabhSga remarks 1488 . 

Gautama contains three sutras about the devolution of 
strldhana, but he does not define or describe it. 148So Kant ( HI 2- 
p. 152 ) defines 1489 : ' means of subsistence and what could 
be tied on the body ( i e ornaments and jewellery ) constitute 
strldhana. The means of subsistence should be fixed at 2000 
( panas ) as the maximum, while there is no limit to { what may 
be given ) as abadhya ( ornaments Sea, )'. This may be com- 
pared with a verse of Kat. (902) and a similar 1490 verse of 
Vyasa viz. * the father, the mother, the husband, brother and 
kinsmen should give strldhana to a woman according to their 
means up to two thousand (panas) except immovable pro- 
perty' The Sm. C. and V. Mayukha explain that this limit of 
2000 applies to gifts made every year, but that if a gift is to be 
made once for all, then more may be given and even immovable 
property may be given. 

The term strldhana literally means 'woman's property'. 
But in the ancient smrti works the word was restricted to 
certain special kinds of property given to a woman on certain 
occasions or at different stages of her life. Gradually suoh 
kinds of property went on increasing in extent and value. We 
have to follow this evolution of the meaning and content of the 
word strldhana. One characteristic feature of stridhana from 
the times of Gautama downwards has been that it devolved on 
females in the first instance The oldest extant definition of it

in DhaTmas&stra works is that of Manu 1 * 91 IX. 194- 'what (was 
given ) before the nuptial fire, what was given on the bridal 
procession, what was given in token of love, what was received 
from her brother, mother or father, that is called the sixfold 
woman's property'. The Mit. on Y5j n 143 explains that the 
number six is intended to exclude a smaller number of the 
kinds of Btrldhana and does not exclude a larger number. In 
IX. 195 Manu appears to mention one more kind viz. 'anw- 
dheya' ( gift subsequent)' Nar. ( dayabhaga, 8 ) has the same 
six kinds as Manu IX. 194, but reads 'bhartrdaya* (the hus- 
band's gift) for Manu's 'what is given in token of affection', 
the latter being thus wider than Narada's words Yaj. (1L 143- 
44) enumerates" 92 the several kinds of strldhana as follows.- 
' what was given ( to a woman) by the father, mother, husband 
or brother or was received by her before the nuptial fire, or 
what was presented on her husband's marrying another wife 
(adhoedamlca) and the like—these are denominated strldhana; so 
also what is given by the cognate relations ( of the woman ), 
the iulka (fee), and gifts subsequent to marriage'. The Mit. 
and most of its followers read ' SdhivedanikSdy am ca\ while 
Apararka and the Dayabhaga read ' adhivedanikam caiva', the 
difference being that if one reads as the Mit. does, several other 
kinds not expressly enumerated can be easily included under 
strldhana. But it should be noted that even without reading 
— kadyam', Apararka explains the verse in the same way as the

War., and V"isnu(inall six) as follows 149 *: what is given to 
women at the time of marriage before the nuptial fire is declared 
by the wise to be adhyaom UK strldhana. That again which a 
Woman obtains when she is being taken (in a procession) from 
her father's house (to the bridegroom's) is declared to headhya- 
vahamka strldhana Whatever is given to a woman through 
affection by the father-in-law or mother-in law and what is 
received by her at the time of doing obeisance at the feet (of 
elders) is said to be prlhdatla (gift through affection) strldhana. 
That is declared to be sulka ( bride's fee ) which is obtained as 
the price of household utensils, of beasts of burden, of milch 
cattle, ornaments and slaves Whatever is obtained by a 
woman after marriage from the family of her husband as also 
from the family of her (father's ) kinsmen is said to be anvadheya 
( gift subsequent ). According to Bhrgu whatever is obtained 
by a woman after marriage through affection from her husband 
or from her parents is anwdhmja\ It may be noted that Katya-

These definitions given by Katyayana have been accepted 
by all digests including even the Dayabhaga, 

" That is known as saudaijika which is obtained by a married 
woman or by a maiden m h.er husband's or father's house from 
her brother or from heT paTBnts *' (Ka-t.). Some of the divergences 
in readings and in interpretation deserve to be noted Ace. to 
the reading adopted by the Mit adhyavahamha includes all 
gifts made by any one when the newly manied girl is taken 
from her father's house in a procession, while the reading 
adopted by the Dayabhaga 1496 and some others ( imtrkql) 
restricts the adhyavahanika to gifts made by the father's or 
mother's family only. The V. R (p. 523) includes under 
adhyavahanika also the gifts made by the father-in-law and 
others when the girl is taken back to her father's house and 
the V O. ( p 138 ) says that it is what is obtained at the time 
of ' dvtiagumana'. The Dayabhaga 1 " 7 (IV. 3. 19-20 p. 93) 
explains ' dohy&bharana-karminam ' differently as 'the gratifica- 
tion paid by house-builders or goldsmiths to induce heT to press 
her husband to engage them* or as Vyasa says 'what is given' to a 
woman to induce her (cheerfully) to go to her husband's house '. 
The Sm. O. and V. P. explain sulka as the price of the articles 
which the bridegroom was in the habit of presenting to the bride 
at the time of marriage or when he started a house. 1498 The V.

Kir. (p. 468) states that sulka has two senses; (1) what is 
given as the price of the girl to the guardians of the girl which 
goes to the mother and brother ( on her death ) ; (2) what is 
given ( by the bridegroom ) as the price of the ornaments for 
the girl and of the household gear. IM9 Another verse of Est. 
(904) has been quoted by many writers, which restricts the 
literal sense of the word 6trldhana, ' over that wealth that is 
obtained by a woman by mechanical arts (snch as spinning) 
or from a stranger through affection, the husband has ownership)

the rest is declared to bo strldhana'." 00 The prima facie 
view (purvapaksa) in Jai. VL 1. 12 urgeB that what a woman 
gets by serving cooked food or by cutting clothes does not 
belong to her. The gifts from strangers here referred to are 
other than those made by a stranger before the nuptial fire or 
at the time of the bridal procession. This definition makes it 
clear that what is obtained even from a stranger by a maiden 
or by a woman who is a widow at the time of the gift is pure 
strldhana Devala says, ' maintenance ( what was given for 
maintenance ), ornaments, sulka ( bride's gratuity ), the profits 
of money-landing are a woman's strldhana. She alone is 
entitled to enjoy it and the husband is not entitled to enjoy it 
except in the case of distress'. 1501 Manu IX. 200 states, 'the 
heirs of the husband should not divide ( among themselves ) 
the ornaments worn by women during the lifetime of their 
husband ; if they divide them they incur sin '. In the printed 
editions of Manu there is no comment of Medhatithi on this 
verse, but the V. B (p. 509 ), V. C. p. 139, Dayatattva p. 184 
all say that ace. to Medhatithi even ornaments, though not 
donated expressly, become strldhana, if worn with the husband's 
consent. 1502 According to the VaijayantI such ornaments should 
be assigned to the share of the woman's husband so that she alone 
might put them on and that it is not meant that such ornaments 
are not to be taken into account at all at the time of partition.

SaudatMa is not a special kind of strldhana. It is rather . 
comprehensive term for several kinds of sttfdhana as S M 

SSL,'. ? ^^sy^nymous with strldhana in the tecli. 
nwal sense Aco. to most writers, it is w^lth received by a 
woman, whether, as a maiden or as a married woman, in L 
father s or husband s house from her parents or relatives of the 
father and mother. The Sm C. 31 p. 282 and V. E p. 511 hold 
that saudayika is all wealth obtained by a woman whether as 
a maiden or as a married woman from her mother, father or 
paternal relatives only, while the Dayabhaga IV. 1. 23 pp 76-77 
and V. 0. hold that saiulaytlcu includes also all, property donated 
by the husband except immovable property, which latter she 
cannot alienate even after her husband's death. There is a 
yerse of Vyaea ls « that defines saudSyika similarly, 'whatever 
is obtained by a woman as a maiden at the time of marriage 
and after marriage from the house of her father or husband, is 
termed saudayika' The word 'saudayika' is derived flora 
'sudaya* and means, according to the Dayabhaga IV. 1.22 
p. 76, 'received from affectionate kindred'. The Amarakosa 
says that 'sudaya' means 'gifts of yautaka and the like' 
and that saudayaka is merely a derivative without change 
of meaning t505 

Another word requiring explanation is ' yauiaka \ It occurs 
in Manu IX. 131, 'whatever is the yautaka of the mother 
goes to the maiden daughter * (and not to the married daughter 
or son). So yautaka seems to be a synonym for strldhana in

the technical sense The Sm 15 ° 5 n p. 285, Madanaratna 
( folio 105 h ) and V. Mayukha remark * yautaka is that wealth 
that is received as a gift from anybody by a woman while she 
is seated together with her husband at the time of marriage and 
the like*. It is derived from ijula ( joined ). It should, however, 
ha noted that Yaj II. '149 employs the word yautaka as^ an 
adjective in the sense of ' separated ' and that Medhatithi on 
Mann IX 131 explains ' yautaka ' -as the separate property of 
a woman, her strldhana The Sm O H. p 285 remarks that 
DevasvamI derived ' yautaka ' from ' yu ' (to separate ) and 
held it to mean 'wealth obtained from the family of the 
woman's father which is separate iu its characteristics '. The 
V. O. p 142 and Vivadacandra p. 74 read ' yautaka ' and the 
former explains it as gifts from the father and the like at the 
time of marriage The Dayatattva ( p 186 ) states that both ' 
forms ' yautaka ' and ' yautuka ' are in vogue and relies on 
Vacaspati and Rayamukuta in support 

Kaut (HL2.p 153) names sulka, anvadheya, adhivedanika 
and bandhudatta as kinds of strldhana. 

The above are the principal smrti tests on the question of 
what constitutes strldhana. It will he seen that the smrtis only 
enumerate and describe certain kinds of property as strldhana, 
which word is not used by them in the etymological sense of 
' all kinds of property possessed by a woman '. They do not 
attempt a comprehensive definition of strldhana. 3?rom the 
texts of the smrtis it follows that strldhana was a technical 
term, which at first included only six kinds of property, then 
nine and ultimately by the time of Katyayana it included all 
property (whether movable or immovable) obtained by a 
woman, either as a maiden or at marriage or after marriage,

from her parents or the family or relatives of the parents or 
from the husband and his family ( except immovable property 
given by the husband) and that what was obtained by a 
woman after her marriage by her own labour or from strangers 
did not become stridhana. Most smrtis employ the word 'datta' 
(donated), but Kit. and VySsa sometimes use the word 
' obtained ' (prapta or labdha ), which is ordinarily wider than 
' datta '. But it is clear that the commentators do not expressly 
say that ' obtained ' includes ' inherited ', though from their 
general remarks to be quoted below it is arguable that they 
probably included inherited property under properly obtained. 

This is stridhana in a technical sense. 

It is now necessary to find bow stridhana was defined by 
the several commentaries and digests that are held authorita- 
tive in the several schools. This is a most important matter 
for practical purposes, since the courts have to follow the 
opinions of commentators 1507 that are authoritative in each 
school and are not at liberty to put their own construction upon 
ancient smrti texts, if such construction wonld run counter to 
the express opinions of the authoritative commentators. l f Jrst 
then comes the Mitaksara. Its gloss on Y&j. IL 143 maybe 
translated aB follows 1508 : 'whatever is given by the father, 
mo&er, husband and brother; what was presented by the 
maternal uncle and the like at the time of marriage before the 
nuptial fire; and adfaoedamlca, that is, gift made (by the basbandj 
at the time of marrying a second wife as will be described 
subsequently in the words * he should give to the wife that » 
superseded ' ( Yaj. H. 148 ) ; by the word « adya ■ ( meaning and 
the like ' ) is indicated property that is obtained by /»«w**\' 
purchase, partition, seizure or finding-all this is declared by 
Em and others to be stridhana. The word strldnana is employ-

definition of strldhana so as to include under it the five kinds 
of property of which a man becomes owner in various ways 
according to Gautama X. 39. The result is that, according to 
the Mit , property of any description belonging to a woman be- 
oomes strldhana even if it be inherited by her from a male as a 
widow or as a mother or even if it be obtained at a partition 
by a wife or mother (ace. to Yaj. II 115 or 123 respectively). 
The same interpretation of the word 'adya* has been accepted 
by several works, such as the Madanaparrjata (p 671 ), the B. V. 
(p 379), V. P. (p 542). the Balambhattl. Apararka without 
reading 'adya* gave the same explanation ot 'ca' as stated 
above ( on p. 773 ). On the other hand, the Dayabhaga gave a 
restricted meaning to the word. Jlmutavahana reads Yaj II. 143 
as 'adhivedamkam catua\ quotes the verse of Devala (in note 
1501), remarks that strldhana is not restricted to the six kinds 
of Manu (IX. 194) but includes other kinds mentioned by 
other smrtis and finally «°» observes : ' that alone is strldhana 
which a woman has authority to donate, sell or enjoy indepen- 
dently of her husband's control*. The Dayabhaga does not 
expressly state the kinds of property that a woman can dispose 
of independently of her husband, but immediately after defining 
strldhana it quotes the texts of Kat. (about earnings from 
mechanical arts and gifts from strangers) and Nar. (IV. 38), 
' what has been given to a wife by her loving husband, she may 
spend or give away as she likes even after his death excepting 
immovables*. From this it follows that, according to the Daya- 
bhaga, all gifts from relations except a gift of immovable pro- 
perty made by the husband and gifts from even strangers made 
before the nuptial fire or on the bridal procession constitute 
strldhana, but property inherited by a woman or obtained on 
partition, gifts from strangers (other than the two kinds noted 
above ) and property acquired by her by mechanical arts or by 
her labour are not strldhana. The DSyatattva closely follows 
the Dayabhaga, 

The Sm. C. does not give a defintion of strldhana, but it 
does not adopt the interpretation of the word "adya* given by

and the like." The Viyadacintamani (the leading authority in 
MithilS ) does not define stridhana in general, but enumerates the 
several kinds of stridhana described by Manu, Taj., Visnu, Eat, 
and Devala and so is on a par with the Dayabhaga. The V. 
Mayfikha divides stridhana into two kinds, panbhasiha (tech- 
nical ) and apanbhasika ( non-technical ). The former comprises 
properties expressly stated to be stridhana by the sages, while 
the latter includes all other property belonging to a woman 
(except what is called technical) and acquired by her by parti- 
tion or cutting (sewing or other meohanical arts). 1511 This 
division is peculiar to the V. Mayfikha. The Viramitrodaya 
(the paramount authority in the Benares school) agrees with 
Mit. as stated above. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to go deeply into modern 
caselaw. But it is necessary to show how the Indian Courts 
have in modern times dealt with stridhana as defined by the 
commentators. It may be said at once that the inclusion by the 
Mit. of property inherited by a woman or obtained at a parti- 
tion under stridhana has been totally discarded by the Privy 
Council for all provinces in India except Bombay «". A woman 
may inherit property from a male, such as from her husband, 
father or son or she may inherit property from a female, that 
is. from her mother, daughter &c. Both these kinds of propert y

are stridhana according to the Mifc, but the Privy Council has 
held as to both those kinds that they are not stridhana ; e g if 
a daughter inherits property from her father or inherits the 
stridhana property of her r mother, it does not become her stii- 
dhana, that on the death of the daughter, the property does not 
pass to hei heirs, but to the next heir of the person from whom 
6he inherited it The Bombay school makes a distinction. If a 
woman enters a family by mamage and then inherits to a male 
of that family ( as e g a widow succeeding to her husband, a 
mother to her son or a predeceased son's widow to her father- 
in-law ), the property she inherits is not her stridhana, she takes 
only a limited estate in it and on her death it passes to the next 
heir of the male from whom she inherited But if a woman 
inherits from a male belonging to the family in which she was 
born ( e. g a daughter succeeding to her father, a sister to her 
brother ) or if a woman inherits property from a female, the 
property so inherited becomes her stridhana ( in Bombay ). As 
to property acquired by a wife or mother on partition 1513 , it has 
been held by the Privy Council that it is not stridhana even in 
provinces governed by the Mitaksara (including Bombay). 

Kat ( 903 ) declares . 15U ' whatever was given to a woman 
for wearing only on some occasion (or on condition) or with 
fraudulent intent by the father, brother or husband is not held 
to be stridhana. ' The idea is that if the father or husband 
gives some ornament to his daughter or wife for wearing on 
some special occasion ( upudhi ) or if a father or husband in 
fraud of his co-parceners gives some family property to his 
daughter or wife it cannot become stridhana. 

Dominion OLer shitlhana. — What is stridhana and what 
dominion a woman has over stridhana depend' on three things, 
viz the source of acquiring the property, her status at the time 
of acquisition (1 e whuther she was a maiden or a man led 
woman whosB husband was living or a widow ), the school of 
l.uv by which she is governed Certain verses of Kat and War 
are the principal texts on this subject Kat ( 905-907, 911 )

may spend it on his family. Neither the husband nor the bod,

ed by labour or about the gift from strangers through affection

follows that a Hindu woman during her maidenhood w* could 
dispose of her strldhana property of every description at her

kind of strldhana including movable property given by the 
husband but not immovable property given by him and that a

non-saudayika is retained, 1517 but the distinction between sau- 
dayika given by the relations and that given by the husband is 
not kept. 1518 Now the woman's power to dispose off as she likes 
depends on the question whether the gift was meant to pass an 
absolute estate or a limited estate even if the husband was the 
donor. During marriage when the husband is living her domi- 
nion depends under modern law upon the character of the stri- 
dhana. If it is of the kind called saudayika she can dispose of 
it by sale, gift or will as she likes without her husband's con- 
sent; but as to other kinds of strldhana property ( such as 
gifts from strangers, property acquired by mechanical arts 
or property inherited ) she cannot dispose of it without her 
husband's consent. If she disposes of it without such con- 
sent the alienation is void According to the D B IV. 
1. 20 property acquired by a married woman by mechanical 
arts or by gift from a stranger is subject to the husband's 
dominion during his life and may be taken by him even 
when there is no distress No one else ( except the husband ) 
has got control over even such strldhana After the hus- 
band's death, she can dispose of even non-saudayika strldhana 
as she likes But even as regards saudayika the texts 
coucede certain rights to the husband in certain circumstances 
Yaj IL 147 says : * the husband is not liable to return 
to the wife her strldhana taken (i e used) by him in a

786 History of Dfarmaiastra [ Vol. 

KBt, (914) l5JO has a similar verso which says that he may 
return Btrldhana wealth if he chooses to do so when it is used 
by hitn in a disease or in calamities or when harassed by 
creditors. Kaut, ( III 2 p. 152 ) is closely similar toYsj. and 
adds that the woman can spend it without blame for the 
maintenance of herself, her son and daughter-in-law or when 
the husband has gone abroad without making provision for the 
maintenance of these. Kaut ( III. 2. p. 152 ) further provides ,5M 
that there should be no complaint ( by the wife ) as regards the 
expenditure of stridhana made more than three years before 
by joint action of the husband and wife when they have given 
birth to two children (or to twins) and when the marriage 
has been in the most approved forms { brahma and 1he other 
three ), that when stridhana has been expended by { the husband 
and wife) that are married in the gandharva or nsura form 
both should be made to restore it with interest and that what 
is expended when the marriage is in the raksasa or patiBca form 
the expenditure of Btrldhana should be dealt with as theft. 
The meaning of 'mithunam prajatayoh* and 'trivarsopa- 
bhuktam'inKaut i B not quite clear. It is probable that Kautilya 
lays down a rule of limitation. If more than three years are 
allowed to pass without complaint, then no complaint made 
later (than three years after the expenditure ) would be enter- 
tained. So also if there be no children of the marriage and 
the husband expends stridhana without objection by the wim 
then also no complaint would be entertained as the restraint 
on alienation of stridhana by the husband and wife wasmeant 
for thebenefit and advancement of the children None of the later 
smrtis like those of Y«. Nar. °r Kfit. makes toesedzstmotto 
and so Kaut probably represents an early stage m M*£* 
of the husband's dominion over stridhana. These W? "^J

Visnu Dh. S. VL 31-32 }. But the Bame smrtis make it clear 
that under certain distressing circumstances the wife's 
separate property was liable for the maintenance or debts of 
the husband. The Mit. expressly states 101 " that if the husband 
uses his wife's strldhana under any other circumstances ( than 
those specified by Yaj. IL 147 and Kat ) then he has to return it, 
that no relation except the husband has any right to use a 
woman's strldhana during her lifetime even in distress or 
disease &o. and relies on Manu VIIL 29 which requires the 
righteous king to award the punishment for theft against such 
relatives as appropriate the wealth of women. The Sm. O. and 
V. Mayukha follow the Mit., but the V. B. and V. C. hold that 
K&tyayana's verse applies not only to the husband, but also 
to the son, father and brothers of the woman. Kat. ( 912-913 ) 
provides 1521 '* that if any one of the four persons { q. in n. 1515 
above) forcibly consumes strldhana he Bhould be made to 
return it with interest and should be also liable to fine ( or 
punishment ) and that if any one of these consumes strldhana 
amicably after securing her consent then he would be liable 
to return only the principal amount, when he becomes well- 
off ( i e. able to pay ). Devala lsM also states, ' if the husband 
makeB a gift of strldhana without cause or enjoys it, he muBt 
pay it back with interest, but he may use the Btxldhana of his 
wife for relieving the distress of a son ( and also of the family, 
aco. to V. Mayukha ). Kat. (908) lsfl adds a speoial rule, ' if the 
husband has two wives and he does not reside with one of them 
( i. e neglects her ), he should be foroibly made to return ( the 
strldhana of his neglected wife ) by the king even though she 
bestowed it upon him through affection.' The texts of Kit., 
Devala and Nsr. quoted above about the dominion of the woman 
over her strldhana and about the husband's power over it are

'wives Bhould not spend (for their own benefit) from the 
property of their families which is common to many, nor from 
their own property without the husband's permission.' The 
V. Mayukha interprets this as meaning that she has no 
independent power even over adhivedanika and the like, but 
this would be opposed to the express texts of Est, Vyasa'and 
Devala. Therefore the words must be taken as only recommen- 
datory, 

K(it. (916) delivers a special rale viz ' strldhana 1HS which 
was promised ( to a woman ) by her husband should be paid 
to her as a debt by the sohb ( i e by her own sons or stepsons ) 
provided she resides in the husband's family, she should 
not reside with her paternal family. ' The Sm. C and V P. 
(p 546 ) explain that even grandsons and great-grandsons are 
liable to pay just as sons are. According to'Kat. as understood 
by the Sm. O and others a wife who is full of evil acts, is 
immodest, wastes property and is given up to adultery, does 
not deserve ( to dispose of ) strldhana and V, P. and V. C. 
explain that it may be taken away from her in each & case tsM 
In modern times this rule of forfeiture of rights would not be 
enforced by the courts as regards strldhana Some explain 
this verse as referring to the widow as heir and separate the 
words as ' strl dhanam.' 1527 Vide Ganga v. Ghasita 1 All 46

on any other. But one thing is generally common to all schools 
viz. that as regards succession to strldhana daughters are prefer- 
red to sons, though, in later days soub were introduced by some 
writers as heirs along with daughters or even as preferable to 
daughters for certain kinds of stridhana. This was probably 
due to the fact that the value of strldhana property became 
considerable in later times and society which held to the doctrine 
ot the dependence and inferior position of women could not 
tolerate the idea that large estates should go to women alone. 
The causes of the variance among writers on tbe devolution of 
strldhana are historical. The text-writers wrote at different 
times and in different countries and probably reflect the 
popular sentiments of their own countries and times tinged 
now and then by personal predilections also. The digests 
sometimes expressly say that their interpretation follows the 
usage of their times (vide V Mayukha in note 1529 below). 

The succession to strldhana varies according as the woman 
is unmarried or married, according as the marriage was in an 
approved or an unapproved form, and also according to the 
species of stridhana and the school of law to which she 
is subject. 

First, the important texts of the smrtis on succession to 
strldhana may be brought together. The oldest extant text is 
that of Gaut 28.23 which provides," 28 'stridhana devolves (first) 
on daughters; (in a competition among daughters) it goes to 
those^ that are unmarried (apratta, lit. not given away in 
marriage ) and { in a competition among married daughters ) to 
those that are not well provided for ( i. e. that are indigent ). ' 
Manu(IX 192-193 ) provides : « when the mother dies all the 
full brothers and full sisters should equally divide tbe mother's 
estate. Even to the daughters of those daughters some 
thing should be given (that is) as much as would be seemly 
out of the estate of their grandmother on the ground of 
affection". InManu IX. 195 it is said that the six kinds of 
strldhana, as also anvadheya stridhana and gifts made by the 
husband through affection, should go to her progeny if she dies 
in her htibband s lifetime. The verses of Manu (JLX 192-3) 
are variously explained by tbe commentators, Sarvajfia-Nara- 
yana holding that mothers estate means estate other than 
technical stridhana. Most of them rely on a text of Br and

790 History qf Dhatniaiastra [Vol. 

hold that full brothers and unmarried staters succeed together 
and married sisters (i.e. daughters of the woman whose heirs 
are to be found) get some trifle (i of each brother ace. to 
Kulluka). Manu IX. 196-197 further provide that when a 
woman wab married in one of the five forms of marriage viz. 
Brahma, Daiva, Area, PrajSpatya and Gandharva and died 
without issue her strldhana goes to her husband and if she was 
married in the 5sura and the other two forms it went, if she 
died issueless, to her mother and father. Taj. n. 1529 117 pro- 
vides that daughters take the strldhana estate of their mother 
and on failure of them the (male) issue. In H. 1530 144 Y&j 
again says that strldhana goes to daughters, hut that if the 
woman dies without issue then it goes to the husband if she was 
married in one of the four forms (brahma, daiva, Srsa, praja- 
patya ) but to her parents if she was married in the other four 
forms. Visnu Dh. S. (17. 19-31) and Nar. ( dayabhaga, 9 ) 
contain the same rules as Taj. H. 144-145, while Nsr. ( daya- 
bhSga 2 ) states that the mother's wealth should be divided 
among the daughters and in the absence of daughters the letter's 
issue takes it. Sankha-Likhifca 1531 declare that the mother's 
estate is taken in equal shares by the full brothers (sons of the 
deceased mother) and their unmarried sisters. Br. 153 * (S. B. B.

33 p. 383 verse 87 ) declares, ' strldhana goes to her progeny, but 
the unmarried daughter is preferred, while the married one 
gets only some trifle as a token of regard'. Parasara holds 
that the unmarried daughters take all the strldhana, but in a 
competition between married daughters alone and sons they all 
take equal shares. Devala 1533 states, 'on the death of a woman her 
strldhana is taken in equal shares by her sons and daughters ; 
if she leaves no issue it would be taken by her husband, mother, 
brother or father'. Paraskara 1534 (q by Par. M. HL 552) states 
that strldhana devolves on the unmarried daughter, that the 
son does not get it, but that he 'shares equally with a married 
daughter. Kaut ls3s ( HL 2 p. 153 ) prescribes that if a woman 
dies during her husband's lifetime her Bons and daughters 
divide her strldhana; if she has no son then daughters divide 
it, on failure (of both sons and daughters) the husband takes 
it and that the sulka, anvadheya or any other kind of strldhana 
given by her relatives is taken by her relatives. KatySyana 1SM 
(917-920) whose treatment of strldhana is the most detailed of 
all smrti writers has the following verses on succession to 
strldhana: 'SiBters whose husbands are living should share 
with their brothers the strldhana ( of their mother ); this is the 
rule of law about strldhana and partition (among brothers and 
sisters) is prescribed. On failure of daughters the (strldhana) 
wealth devolves on sons (of the deceased woman ); the wealth 
given to a woman by her kinsmen ( paternal or maternal ) goes

Wliatovor immovable property was given by the parents to their 
daughter always goes to her brother if ishe dies without issue. 
Whatever wealth was obtained by a woman from her parents in 
the forms of marriage beginning with Ssura is declared as going 
to her parents on failure of her progeny. ' 1S3 ' The first two verses 
are apparently in conflict and must be read with Gaut 28 22 
So probably the following propositions were laid down by Kat. 
via (1) unmarried daughters are preferred; (2) married daughters 
whose husbands are living share along with their brothers, if 
there bo no unmarried daughter ; (3) widowed daughters take 
or.ly if there are no daughters whose husbands are living or if 
there are no sons : (4) wealth given by paternal and maternal 
kinsmen goes to them and on failure of these, to the husband ; 
(5) immovable property given by parents goes to the brother 
of the woman on failure of issue; (6) wealth given mtbe 
fisura, raksasa and paisSca forms goes to parents on failure of 
issue Yamahas a verse very similar to Katyayana's about 
a woman married in the Ssura and the following forms The 
commentaries and digests make valiant efforts to reconcile the 
conflicts among the smrti texts quoted above It is not quite 
necessary to go into that question here in detail for fear of 
encumbering this work too much. 

How the devolution of etrldhana was dealt with ly the 
commentators has now to be seen. They all prefer daughters 
to sons for certain kinds of strldhana. Why the devolution j* 
strldhaua property should be different from that of the property 
of a male is not clearly explained anywhere. The Mit on 
Yfij 1HS II 117 gives the reason that woman's property goes w 
the daughter because in her more particles of the m<* te, /*2 
inhere than in the son Probably the daughters were jw&w« 
as heirs to strldbana as a sort of equity, whet .sons were 
allowed to exclude daughters in the inheritance to the fathers 
wealth. , 

According to the Mit. there are two lines of *™™*™£ 
strldhana, one for sulka and the other for allother kinds of £ 
dhana Solka^tojt^^

on the full brothers, then on the mother. iSS> Some like the 
SuhodhinI, the Dlpakalika, HaTadatta on Gaut. 28. 23 hold that 
it devolves on the mother first and then on the full brothers ; 
but many works such as the DSyabhaga IV. 3. 28 (p. 95), Sm. 0„ 
Par. M , V. P., V. 0. follow the Mit. It is somewhat strange 
that the MadanapErijata. p. 668 ( which was really composed 
by the author of the SuhodhinI in the name of his patron 
Madanapala, holds that the sulka is first taken by the brothers 
and then by the mother. This raises a doubt whether the 
printed SuhodhinI is correct or whether the author changed 
his opinion. 

As regards succession to the property of a maiden there is 
no difference at all between the Mit. and otheT works. The 
Mit. quotes a text of Baudhayana 1SM that the wealth of a 
deceased maiden first devolves on her full brothers, then on the 
mother and then on the father. The V. P. adds that on failure 
of the father the maiden's wealth goes to the parents' nearest 
sapinda.«" Yaj. H. 146 provides that if a girl who had been 
promised in marriage dies before marriage, the intending 
bridegroom was entitled to take back the sulka or other gifts

order of propinquity ; on failure of any sapinda of the husband 
her mother, then her father and then the sapindas of the father 
( before it goes to the Crown ). But if the woman was marriea 
in one of the unapproved forms, then on failure of her descen- 
dants her stridhana went to her mother, then to her father and 
then to the father's sapindas in the order of propinquity. On 
failure of the sapindas of the father it would (by analogy) go to 
her husband and then to his sapindas (before going to the 
Crown ). When grand-daughters directly inherit' the stridhana 
of their grandmother they take per stirpes (aoc to the Mit 
which quotes Gfaut 28 15), if they are the daughters of several 
daughters. *»* The Mit (on YSj. 1L US ), Apararks (p. 721) sad 
aeveralothersprovide (following ManuIX198=Anusasana4M5) 
that if a woman of a lower caste dies issueless leaving stridhana, 
then the daughter of her co-wife of a higher olass inherits that 
Btrldhana and on failure of such step-daughter, the son of the 
latter inherits. It may be noted that as regards succession 
to stridhana, the' rule of representation which holds good in 
relation to succession to males does not apply. When a male 
dies leaving separate property and a son and a grandson ( son 
of a predeceased son ) both succeed together, the grandson re- 
presenting his deceased father. But if a woman possessed of 
stridhana dies having only a son and a predeceased son's son, 
the son will take the whole of thB Btrldhana excluding the son's 
son. Vide Bat Raman v Jagjwandas 41 Bom 618. 

It is not possible nor necessary to deal exhaustively with 
the' devolution of stridhana according to the various schools of 
Hindu Law. But a few indications from the important text

books having authority in the different provinces will be offer- 
ed. According to the Sm. O. ( which is the leading authority in 
Madras after the Mit. ) strldhana includes only those kinds of 
property that are so described in the Bmrtis ( i. e. only technical 
strldhana ) and the lines of devolution are as follows : (1) sulka 
devolves in the same way as laid down by the Mit. cited above 
(Sm. O. II p. 287); (2) Yautaka devolves on unmarried 
daughters first ( Sm. O. II. p. 285 ) ; (3) Anvadheyaka and 
Bhartrdatta pass to sons and married daughters whose husbands 
are living, all inheriting together in equal shares ( Sm. C. U. 
p. 284); (4) other kinds of technical strldhana such as 
adhyagni &c pass first to the maiden daughters and married 
daughters who are aprattstlttta, isi3 then to married daughters 
that are provided for ; then to daughter's daughters, then to 
daughter's sons, then to sons, then to son's sons &c., then to the 
husband or father ( according to the form of marriage ). The 
Madras High Court follows the Mit. ( in preference to the Sm. 
C. ) as to the devolution of Anvadheyaka and Bhartrdatta and 
holds that certain kinds of non-technical strldhana ( such as 
gifts by strangers during coverture ) devolve ace. to the rules of 
the Mit. Vide Salemma v. Iwtchmana 21 Mad. 100. 

The VivadacintSmani, the leading authority in Mithila, 
restricts strldhana to the technical strldhana recognized by the 
smrtis and lays down the devolution of itas follows : (1) Sulka ,s " 
( defined as property received by a woman at the time of her 
marriage, if in an unapproved form ) passes as under the Mit. 
cited above ; (I) Yautaka passes first to unmarried daughters, 
then in the way laid down by the Mit. for all strldhana ; (3) all 
technical strldhana other than the two preceding varieties 
passes to sons and unmarried daughters together, then to sons 
and married daughters jointly, then to daughter's daughters, 
then to daughter's sons and then as under the Mit system ( for 
strldhana in general. )

Eonkan 15 * 5 proposes various lines of succession to strldhana. Its 
treatment Is based on the Sin. 0. and the Madanarafcna. ft first 
divides strldhana as stated above into technical (paribhasika) 
and non-technical ( apSribhaslka ). The fir B t is subdivided into 
four classes for the purpose of inheritance; (I) sulka which 
passes as stated above under the Mitakgara; (H) yautaka goes 
to unmarried daughters, (if there be no unmarried daughters)

11 Bom 285 {F B ) at pp, 294-95 As there is divergence between the 
vieus of the Mit and the Mayiikha in the rules of succession, it becomes a 
matter of great practical importance to settle with precision the exact limits 
in Northern Konkan up to which the Mayukha must be regarded as a wort 
of paramount authority. It has bean judicially decided that Karanja, as 
Island opposite the Bombay harbour, is governed by the Mayukha (in Sakha- 
ram v, Sttabai 3 Bom. 353), that Mahad, the southernmost Talukaoltne 
Kolaba District, is not so goi erned and that toe predominance of the Mayii- 
kha cannot be taken further south than Cheu! and Nagotbna in the Kolaba 
District (vide Narharv Bhait 40 Bom 621) Similarly difficult questions 
arise whether Kathiawar which is quite contiguous to Gujarat and some 
territory bordering on Gujerat towards the north or east is governed by tho 
views of the Mayukha in preference to those of the Mit, Some parts of 
Kathiawar which were (and even now are) under the domination of the 
Gaikwad of Baroda may, on the analogy of the grounds on which the Mayu- 
kha is held to be of paramount authority in Gujarat, be deemed to begovsraed 
by the Mayukha It appears to me that the tendency of courts should be 
to restrict the extent of the territory «i which the Mayukha is supreme and 
to hold that everywhere the Mitaksara is supreme, except in those territories 
where the Maytikba has been expressly recoginsed as supreme by the feuda- 
tory States connguous to Gujarat or by judicial decisions The M.t « •

brother's son, sister's son, husband's sister'^ son, brother's son, 
daughter's husband. Br. says that the mother's sistar, maternal 
uncle's wife, paternal uncle's wife, fa'hor's sister, mother-in- 
law, elder brother's wife are declared to be like one's mother, 
that when these women have no aurasa child or a con of their 
co-wife oi a daughter's son or a son's sou or stepson's son, then 
the sister's son and the rest may take their wealth. This text, 
ace. to the Dayabhaga, simply declares that a sister's son and 
the others may be heirs to the strldhana of the maternal aunt 
and the rest but the priority is determined among the six heirs 
mentioned above in Brhaspati 's text by the principle of reli- 
gious benefit. Though the sister's son is the first jn Brhaspati's 
text, it is the husband's younger brother who stands really the 
first among the six if regard is had to the principle of religious 
benefit. The Vlr. ( V. P. p. 554 ) states that in the atwer.ee of 
heirs up to the stepson and stepson's sons, the sister's son and 
the rest (mentioned in Br.) are the heirs to a woman's stir 
dhana even when sapindas like her father-in-law are alrre, 
since mere sapinda relationship would not count when in conflict 
with a special text It does not appear that the V. P. holds that 
the six take in the order stated in the text of Br ; 15si it Tatar 
states that among these six the choice of the preferential heir

would be determined by greater or less propinquity lssS . On 
failure of these six the husband's sapindas, safculyas and 
samanodakas take and then the father's kinsmen. 

The question of an unchaste daughter's succession to strl- 
dhana would be decided in the same way as her succession to 
her father's property. Under the DayabhSga an unchaste 
daughter will not succeed. But under the Mitaksara as inter- 
preted by modern courts an unchaste daughter who is a kept 
mistress or a prostitute may succeed but only after virgin 
daughters or mamed daughters as the case 1556 may be. The 
Mit. on Yaj. II 290 relies upon the SkandapurSna for the 
proposition that prostitutes are a fifth caste descended from 
certain apsarases. issi 

It has been held by the courts that though prostitution 
entailed degradation according to ancient Hindu Law, it did 
not sever the tie of blood. So the stridhana of a nailcin ( a 
dancing girl ) or of a married woman who becomes a prostitute 
may be inherited by her brother or sister or her husband or her 
husband's relations. lsss 

It may not be out of place here to suggest how stridhana 
should be dealt with when Hindu Law comes to be codified as 
it is likely to be in the near future. It may be urged that all 
distinctions on the ground of sex should be altogether done 
away with and whenever a woman succeeds to any property 
whether of a male or of a female she should take an absolute 
estate. But if this change iB opposed by a large volume of 
opinion as it is quite possible, then it should at least be provided

that all property which a woman inherits from a female should be 
her absolute property. Then aB regards inheritance to'strldhana 
one simple and straightforward rale should be laid down that 
the woman's sons and daughters should succeed together taking 
equal shares. A third suggestion would be that when there are 
no descendants of the woman herself, then the husband should be 
the next heir. When the stridhana is that of a maiden, the 
heirs in order should be her brothers and Bisters, then her mother, 
then her father and after the father the latter's nearest heir. It 
is not quite necessary at this stage to specify what further 
rules of devolution should be prescribed, < 



CHAPTER XXXI 
MAINTENANCE AND OTHER TOPICS ' 

The subject of maintenance occupies an important place in 
modern Hindu Law. A brief statement of the law of the 
smrtis and the digests on this subject must be made here. 

The liability to provide maintenance for certain persons 
arises under the ancient Hindu Law in either of two ways viz. 
(1) on account of bare relationship between the parties or (2) on 
the ground of the possession of property. A verse lss * quoted 
by Medhatifchi on Manu III. 72 and IV. 251, by the Mit. on Yaj. 
I. 224 and 1L 175 and occurring in some mss. of the Manusmrti 
after XI 10 provides, ' Manu declares that one must maintain 
one's aged parents, a virtuous wife and a minor son by doing 
even a hundred bad acts. * From this verse it follows that 
irrespective of the possession of property there is a personal 
legal obligation on the father to maintain his minor son, on the 
husband to maintain his wife and on the son to maintain his 
aged parents. Baud. Dh. S 01.2. 48) goes further andprovides* 560 
that a son is bound to maintain a mother even if she be patita. 
To the same effect are Ap Dh. S 1 10. 28. 9 and Vas. 13. 47.

Maintenance of widows 805 



in the Sm. a explaining a .verse of Nar. viz. widows that are 
virtuous must be maintained with food and raiment by the 
eldest brother ( of the deceased ) or by the father-in-law or by 
any otheT gotraja* on which it remarks: "The words ' by him 
who takes the estate ', must be understood before all the words 
such as ' the eldest brother * ". Kat. { 922 ) states, ' when the 
husband goes to heaven the wife is entitled only to food 
and raiment if he was unseparated or ,she may set a share in 
( ancestral ) property till her death *. The Sm. C. remarks that 
as maintenance depends upon taking wealth, Kat. provides two 
alternatives. "Iri cases too numerous to cite this has been 
followed by all High Courts." Similarly an heir is bound to 
maintain out of the estate taken by him those persons whom 
the deceased was legally or morally bound to maintain. Those 
persons who are excluded from inheritance or partition are 
entitled to maintenance and their virtuous wives and unmarried 
daughtprs also are entitled to be maintained ( Yaj. II. 140-142 
Manu IX. 202, Vas 17. 54 ). The Baud. Dh. S. ( IL 2. 43-46 ) ,5 « 
provides that those who are past undertaking transactions ( i e, 
are very old ) should be given food and raiment and also those 
who are blind, idiotic, impotent, immersed in vice and suffering 
from ( incurable ) diseases, and those that engage in prohibited 
acts, except the patita and his issue. Devala { quoted in the V 
Mayukha p. 165 ) has a similar passage, ' when the father is 
dead ( or even when being alive he makes a partition ) the 
impotent, the leper, the lunatic, the idiot, the blind, an outcast 
and his offspring, a person wearing a heretical sect mark — these 
are not entitled to a share of the .heritage ; to these except the 
pahta food and raiment are to be given *. These persons suffer 
from a personal disqualification and maintenance is given to 
them in lieu of a share not because their status is denied 
but because they are incapable of management and enjoyment 
of property. Vide Raja Ram Rao v. Raja of Pdtapwr. ls66 

The general principle is that an heir is legally bound to 
provide out of the estate taken by him as heir maintenance for 
those persons, male or female, whom the late owner was morally 
or legally bound to maintain. For example, if there is no 
ancestral property the father-in-law who possesses only self-

acquired property is not legally bound to maintain his daughter- 
in-law ( widow of a predeceased son ) ; but on the death of the 
father-in-law, his heir i. e. son, widow, or daughter -would be 
legally bound to maintain a widowed daughter-in-law. 1S *» The 
Bombay High Court, however, adds the condition that the 
predeceased son must have been in union with his father when he 
died ; vide 23 Bom. 603. 

By Act XVIII of 1937 it has been provided that in a family 
governed by the Mitsksara the widows of deceased coparceners 
such as the daughter-in-law and the grand-daughter-in-law are 
entitled to their husband's interest. The Act does not expressly 
state that their rights to maintenance are taken away. In 
many cases such widows may prefer to take a share instead of 
being allotted only maintenance and so far the law of mainten- 
ance will tend to become obsolete. 

Another important question is what is the effect of unoha- 
stity on the right to maintenance ? As regards the wife's right 
to maintenance and the effect of unchastifcy thereon during the 
husband's lifetime, vide H. of Dh. vol. H pp. 571-73 above. 
Manu XL 176 says that a wife guilty of adultery Bhould be 
confined by the husband in the same house and should be made 
to undergo the same penance as a man guilty of adultery has 
to undergo ; Ysj I 70 also says- that a wife guilty of adultery 
should be deprived of her status as a wife as to wealth and 
religious observances, should be given bare maintenance and 
should be confined to a part of the house. Unohastity on the 
nart of a Hindu widow disentitles her to maintenance under 
certain circumstances Vas 31.10 provides that_ f our c a sses 
of wives must be abandoned viz. one who yields herself toner 
husband's pupil or to his guru and especially one' who attempta 
the life of her husband or ^o commits adultery wito a man 
of a degraded caste and in 31. 1* Vasistha states that the whj 
of brshmanas, ksatriyas and vaisy^s, who c^nm a£ultay 
with a sudra, may be purified by penance rf «o*ja » £«

HI J Maintenance and unchattity 807 

Maim IX. 188 provides that when women beconv pxt-ta, the rite 
calUd gkatasphoia ( the procedure of which may be seen at 
p. 388 of the H. of Dh. vol. II and in note 1168 in the Appendix 
to this volume) may he performed, but they must he given 
food and raiment and they must be provided with a hut near 
the family house. Yaj.HI. 296 has a similar provision. The 
result is that there is no text which provides that a widow who 
is once unchaste must be deemed unchaste for ever and must 
for ever forfeit her claim even to a starving maintenance even 
if she repents, reforms her ways and gives up an immoral life. 
On the contrary the texts, say that widows guilty of adultery 
aTe purified by penance and may be restored to all their social 
privileges. For example, Manu lsw XI. 189 says generally 
about all persons that after they perform the appropriate 
VrUyaictfla, they should not be rebuked or avoided ( but should 
he restored to all social intercourse ). The Mit. on Yaj. L 72 
expressly says that the abandonment of even Buch women aB 
are referred to in that verse consists in not associating with 
them conjugally and in religious matters, but does not mean 
that they aTe to be driven out of the house. 1568 

On Yaj.HL 397 (which states that in the case of women 
there are three peculiarly grave BinB viz. adultery with a low- 
caste man, killing the foetus and attempt to murder the 
huBband) the Mit sums up the whole position as follows : (1) 
total abandonment of women for the four grave sins laid down 
mVas. 21. 10 takes place when they do not perform penance: 
(2) women guilty of adultery not of the aggravated, kind 
mentioned in Vaa 21. W are to be given starving maintenance 
that would keep body and soul together and are to be lodged in 
»„^mX > h ™ B ° an * to *• aff « d ^ protection ( Yaj. X 70

But the Mvt. is silent as to the claim to maintenance of widowa 
that at first led a life of incontinence ( but not of the aggrava- 
ted kind ) and subsequently reformed their ways. But from 
Manu XL 189 it may be inferred that w idows not guilty of

aggravated adultery that have undergone the proper prayaseMa 
and that "return to decent life would have been entitled to 
ordinary maintenance from the period they turned ovsr a 
new leaf. 1569 

A brief reference to the modern case law on this point 
may be made here. In Bhvkubai v. Bhrtba' isn Sir Lallubhai 
Shah ( after an elaborate examination of ancient and medieval 
authorities and decided cases ) held that a widow who had been 
unchaste, but who is proved to have given up the life of un- 
chastity is entitled to bare maintenance. In Lalclimtchand v. 
Atiatuh the Privy Council make the general observation." 71 'It 
is true that the right of a Hindu widow to maintenance is 
conditional upon her leading a life of chastity and that sho 
loses that right if she becomes unchaste '. In Ktsanjt v. 
Lakshm lsn it was held that subsequent unchastity disentitled 
a widow from recovering maintenance, even though it is claim- 
able under an agreement made with the deceased ,'hUBband's 
father and brother. In Mummmal Ganga v. Ghasita I All. 46 (F. B.) 
it 'has been held that unchastity does not incapacitate a daughter 
from inheriting strldhana. In Angammal v. Venlaia 2G Mad 
509 the same rule was laid down. 

The illegitimate son born of a sudra concubine to a man 
of the three higher castes appears to have been held entitled 
to maintenance from very early times. Gaut. 28. 37 pro™ 68 - 
•the son from a sudra woman of a man (of the three higher 
varnas ) who is without issue receives maintenance ( lit source 
of maintenance ), if he is obedient, in the same way as a pupil 
might receive'. And Gautama (28 43) extends the same rule 
to the offspring of praldoma unions. Vide p. 601 above and 
note' 1135 for the text of Gau t and Br. on the point. Miami* -

IE ] Maintenance of an illegitimate son 809 

155 also provides that the son of a man of the three higher castes 
from a sudra woman (not married to him) is not entitled to share 
in the ancestral estate. Br. (SB.E. 33 p. 374 v. 31) states ls73 that 
an obedient and meritorious son born from a woman of the 
sudra caste to a man who has no other child should get main- 
tenance and that the sapindas should divide the rest of the 
wealth of the deceased. Both the Mit ana the V. Mayukba, 
while explaining Yaj. IE. 133-134 about the rights of the 
illegitimate son of a sfidra from a sMra Woman, remark that 
one who is begotten on a dasi n7i by a member of the regenerate 
classes is not entitled to a share even at the father's choice nor 
to a' half share after his father's death but that he is only 
entitled to maintenance. 1S7S 

There is a good deal of case law ©n this subject, but much 
of it is irrelevant in this treatise. The right of maintenance 
attaches in the first instance to the separate property of the 
putative father and if the latter leaves no such property but 
was a member of a joint family it attaches to the property of 
the joint family of which the putative father was a member. 1576 
It has further been held that it does not matter if the woman 
was not a dasl ( a slave ) or a permanent concubine in the 
exclusive keeping of a man or that the intercourse was adult- 
erous. 15 " 7 It has been also held that the illegitimate son's right 
to maintenance is a personal right and cannot be transmitted 
to his son 1578 and that maintenance has to be provided for him 
till his death 1579 (and not merely up to his attaining majority),

except in Bengal. 1580 The fact that the texts employ the word 
"sudraputraV (in the masculine gender ) has been interpreted 
by the decided cases as involving that an illegitimate daughter 
is not entitled under Hindu Law to maintenance. Vide Parvatt 
v. Ganpalrao 1591 and Vellaigappa v. Natarajan.* 5 * 1 

Another frequent subject of litigation in modern times has 
been a concubine's right of maintenance under the Hindu Lav. 
It has been held that a concubine has no legal right to claim 
maintenance from her paramour during the letter's Iifetimei 
as he can discard her at any time and as she cannot compel 
him to keep her. 1583 So also a Hindu is not entitled to transfer 
joint family property to a concubine for her maintenance during 
his lifetime. 1584 But on the death ol the paramour a great 
difference is made in the rights of a concubine that was in his 
exclusive keeping HI ha death. Such a concubine has been held 
to possess a legal right to maintenance payable out of the 
estate, ancestral or self-acquired as the case may be, m the 
hands of those who take it after the death of the paramour The 
rights of women, who are not wives, to maintenance are based 
mainly on two texts, vie. of Tfarada and Katyayana, that are 
explained in the Mit, the V. Mayukba and other medieval 
works. NSrada says; 1SBS ' A king devoted to dharma should 
give maintenance to the women (stri) of a deceased person 
( when the king succeeds as heir by esoheat ), except when the 
deceased person is a brahmana'; while Kftt (931) states, * 
' heirless property goes to the king after keeping aside ( wealth 
sufficient to provide ) for the women {yosil ), the dependents (or 
servants ) and the funeral rites and sraddhas (of the deceased)

Kaut. also similarly prescribes (EX 1SS7 5. p. 161), 'the king 
takes heirless property except that of irotriyas, setting apart 
( wealth ) for the maintenance of women ( of the deceased ), for 
funeral rites and for poor or wretched (dependents of the 
deceased ) '. The Mit, the V. Mayukha, the Par. M. and 
others state that the verses of Nar. and Eat refer to avaruddha- 
stri alone, since the word patnl (duly wedded wife) does 
not occur therein, but only the words * yosit' and l slri \ 1SS8 There 
has been a great divergence of views in the decided cases about 
the significance of avca uddha strl. It is generally rendered as 
a concubine or mistress in the exclusive keeping of a person 
till the latter's death". Several conditions are necessary to 
constitute a woman an avaruddlia strl capable of claiming 
maintenance from the estate of her deceased paramour in the 
hands of his sons or other heirs. In the first place, she must 
have been continuously and exclusively in his keeping till his 
death. How long she should have been thus in his keeping 
cannot be fixed by any hard and fast rules. She must have 
been so long in his keeping continuously till his death that it 
can be said that the connection had become permanent. In 
Box Nagubai v Bai Mongfabai a period of five years was deemed 
to be sufficient In the second place the concubine lss » must 
observe sexual fidelity to her deceased paramour after his death 
in order to be able to claim maintenance from the estate in the 
hands of his heirs or successors. In Bai Monghibai v. Boa 
Nagubai 1 *'* a third condition was laid down viz. that the con- 
nection of the concubine with the deceased paramour should be 
perfectly open and recognized and she must have been kept 
practically as a member of the family. But in Bat Nagubai 
Bai Monglnbai' lsn the Privy Council overruled the above deci- 
sion and held that in order to entitle a mistress to maintenance 
it is not necessary that she should have resided in the same

house with the deceased together with his wife and the ordinary 
members of his family. And in Dayavah v Kesarbw* 3 * 1 it was 
further held' that the concubine need not prove that she was 
recognized by the family of the deceased ot that his relationship 
with her was known to the family. A further restriction was 
imposed by the case of Ananddal v Gliandrdbat' isa that the 
intercourse with the paramour should not have been adulterous. 
But this case has been overruled by a recent Full Bench deci- 
sion in AJcku v Ganesh* 59 * which holds that a permanently kept 
concubine is entitled to be maintained out of the estate of her 
deceased paramour, although she has a husband living ( who 
was examined in the case as a« witness ), provided she observes 
sexual fidelity to the deceased paramour after his death. It 
becomes, therefore, necessary to examine the Sanskrit medieval 
commentaries and digests in order to arrive at a correct inter- 
pretation of the expression x avaruddha stri\ Strangely enough, 
the Mit. does not define the word in the section on dSyabhaga, 
but only under ' strf-sangrahana '. Yaj II 290 provides, ' a man 
should be awarded a fine of fifty payas, if he has intercourse 
with dSBls that are avaruddlia or that are bhup^ia and also 
(other women such as prostitutes and sixunnis), even though 
ordinarily they ( i e dasls and others ) are approachable (with- 
out incurring the consequence of punishment)* The Mit 
explains that the word 'ea' placed after 'bhujisyasu| in Yal. 
IL 290 is meant to include vesyas and sixunnis along with bhirji- 
sySs. Ace. to the Mit. the verse prescribes the same fine for 
intercourse with three kinds of women, viz. dasls that are ava-

of women at all. The 'Mit here defines ' avaruddha das* ' as " a 
slave woman who is prohibited by her master from intercourse 
with other men with an order to stay in the master's house alone 
in order that there may be no loss of attendance ( on the mas- 
ter ). " The Mit. defines a bhujisya dasi as ' one who is restricted 
(as to enjoyment) to certain definite males' (puru^amyaia-part- 
grabd. bhujisyah ) 1S9S It is worthy of note that the Mit employs 
different phraseology in defining the' two words. In defining a 
bhujisya it employs the word 'ruyata', which generally means 
'fixed or definite', while in defining 'avaruddha' it employs 
the word 'niruddhah' meaning 'prevented or prohibited'. If 
the two words were intended to convey the same meaning, 
there is no reason why the Mit. should not have employed the 
same word {mraddha) in defining a bhujisya. The difference 
between an avaruddha dasi and a bhujisya is that the former is 
ordered to stay in the master's house, while the bhujisya is not 
so ordered and secondly the avaruddha is forbidden to have 
sexual intercourse with any one except the master, while the 
bhujisya is not so forbidden, but she is to restrict herself to 
enjoyment by certain specified males ( friends or men of the 
master's family ) and not necessarily by the master alone. This 
is the meaning assigned to those words by Mitramisra in his 
commentary ls,<s (not his digest) on Yaj IL 290. The Mit. itself 
indicates the meaning of 'niyata' by saying elsewhere that owner- 
ship springs from certain fixed sources {myatqpayakam svatvam 
on Yaj II 114). It is respectfully submitted that the Privy 
Council gave a wrong interpretation of the word ' avaruddha * 
in Bat Naqubai v. Bai Monghibcn ls>7 . Though slavery is now 
abolished in India there is no reason why the two characteris- 
tics of avaruddha ( viz staying in the master's house and being

exclusively kept by the master) stated by the Mit. should not 
have been strictly adhered to by the Privy Council, particularly 
when they were holding heirs liable for the maintenance of 
kept mistresses, which is hardly ever allowed in any other 
system of law. With the greatest respect to the Full Bench, it 
must be said they went wrong in holding that bhujisya means 
' a mistress who is restrained from intercourse with other per- 
sons ( other than the master ) ' and in holding that the only 
distinction between an avaruddha and a bhujisya is that the 
former is required to stay in the house of the paramour, while 
the latter is not ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 13 and %% ). The learned 
judges have not correctly interpreted the word 'niyata' and 
also the explanation of 'bhujisya * given by the Balambhattl ,5M . 
The meaning of the Balambhattl was misunderstood on account 
of the wrong meaning attached to the word 'niyata'. What 
the Balambhattl means in explaining the definition of bhujisya 
is 'one who is to be enjoyed by certain definite males only other 
than the master* (i. e. by the master and also certain defined 
males) and it does not mean 'who is forbidden to be enjoyed by 
males other than the master'. 

The F. B. further rely upon a passage of the Mit. in support 
of their conclusion (47 Bom. L. E. at pp. 14 and 22) On the 
question of what properties are impartible, the Mit. on Yaj. B- 
119 quotes Manu IX. 219 viz * clothes, conveyances, ornaments, 
cooked food, water (wells &e.), women, yogalcsema and pastures lor 
waysHhese they declare are impartible ■ The Mit explanation ( 
of the word * striyah • may be translated as follows : stnyah

HI J Meaning qf avaruddha 815 

passage can be explained in two or three different ways. In the 
first place, the Mit. having itself clearly distinguished^ and 
defined three classes, viz avaruddha, bhujisyS, and Bvairinls 
( together with vesyas also ) it cannot be lightly supposed that 
elsewhere it gives up that distinction. Therefore it would be 
difficult to say that here ( on Yaj 1L 119 ) the Mit. means that 
svairims are also the same as avaruddhas. Hence the inter- 
pretation should be that women who are avaruddha (kept 
exclusively by the father ) and even other women also like 
svairinls ( who had sexual connection with the father though 
not as avaruddha ) should not be divided i. e. a ' ca ' should be 
understood after ' svairinyadyah '. Or it is possible to hold that 
the word ' avaruddha ' in that passage is not employed in the 
strict technical sense ( as defined by the Mit. on Yaj. 31, 290 ), 
but in its etymological sense meaning 'women who are svairinls 
and the like that are taken into his harem ( or under his protec- 
tion ) by the father should not be divided ". This interpretation 
derives support from the explanation offered by the Subodhinl 
( which is repeated almost verbatim by the BalambhattI ) about 
the text of Gautama quoted by the Mit. that * samyukta ' 
in Gaut. means ' enjoyed ' or ' confined ' ( in the house ). 
This shows that the words 'ruddha' and 'avaruddha* were 
used in the etymological sense by distinguished writers. The 
Sm. O. II p. 331 while explaining the word ' ruddha * in Manu 
IX. 12 applied to a wife guilty of adultery explains it as mean- 
ing ' confined in a part of the house ' ( grhe avaruddham ). 
When the Mit. states ( p. 811 ) that the verses of Nar. and Kat. 
refer to avaruddha strl it follows that these verses do not refer 
to bhujisya, who would therefore be deemed not entitled to 
maintenance at all. 

There is a large body of caBelaw about the right of a 
widow in a joint Hindu family to reside in the family house, 
about the right of a daughter-in-law against her deceased 
husband's father who has no ancestral property in his hands 
and against the heirs of the f ather-in-rlaw, about the amount of 
maintenance to be allowed to a widow and about the rate at 
which arrears of maintenance are to be allowed, about the 
period for which arrears may be awarded, about making the 
maintenance a charge on the estate in the hands of the heirs, 
about varying the rate of maintenance fixed by a decree or an 
agreement &c. rhese are not quite germane to the present 
volume, particularly because most of the decisions on these 



8i6 History of Dkarmaiastra [ Vol- 

matters are not based on the words of the smrtis or of the medieval 
digests, but are based on logic and principles of justice and 
equity. But there is one matter which deserves a passing 
reference. Ancient Hindu Law attached the higheBt spiritual 
importance to the payment of dehts ( vide pp. 414-417 above ). 
Therefore debts contracted by a Hindu are held by the Courts to 
take precedence over the right of maintenance of a man's wife, 
his infant child or his widow after his death. 1600 Similarly debts 
contracted by the manager of the joint family of which the 
widow's husband was a member would take precedence over the 
widow's right of maintenance, provided the debts were for the 
benefit of the family or were for legal necessity. 

The last vyauahaiapada is prakirnaka, which is denned by 
Visnu Dh. S. 42 ' 1 as ' miscellaneous * ( yadanuktam tat pra- 
kfrnakam ) or by Nar. as matters that were to be set in motion 
by the king himself ( vide note 331 ). These have been dealt 
with above and do not require any further treatment here. 

At the end of this section on Vyavabara it would not be 
out of place to say a few words about wills. Owing to the joint 
family system and the custom of adoption testamentary die- 
positions did not come into vogue in ancient India. Among the 
many kinds of documents (lefjiya) mentioned by Kaut,, Br , Kat 
and others cited above there is no term for a document which can 
convey the idea of a modern will. But it need not be supposed 
that the idea had not at all dawned upon the minds of people 
before the advent of the British 1601 . Wills were known among 
Mahomedans and contact with them would naturally suggest 
the idea of a will. Oral or written instructions by a man 
expecting death to his heirs intended to affect the disposal of 
his property must have been given occasionally and should not

be supposed to have been entirely unknown. Verses 341-359 of 
the Kajataranginl IV. appear to embody the political testament 
of king Lalitsditya of Kashmir in the first half of the 8th 
century. Kat. (566) makes a very near approach to the modern 
conception of a will 1602 . He says, * if a gift was promised by a 
man for a religious purpose whether when in good health or 
when afflicted with disease, the son should be made to pay it, if 
the father dies without giving it over.' Here the mere declara- 
tion of the intention of a person was made enforceable after his 
death against the son or other heir. Brhaspati's verse saying 
that a promise or direction to take effect after the death of the 
promisor was not ordinarily enforceable has already been 
quoted above ( n. 823 ). In the quarterly of the Bharata-itihasa- 
samsodhaka Mandala of Poona, vol. XX p. 210 ( for May 1940 ) 
there is a letter ( dated 1775 A. D. ) written by one Haro Babaji, 
who, after referring to his illness, provides on a generous scale 
for his funeral and sraddha expenses and makes dispositions in 
favour of his daughter-in-law, of another widow, and for the 
marriage of his kinsman's soub and distribution of the balance 
of hiB assets 1603 .

One of the earliest wills to come before the British Indian 
Courts Was that of the notorious Umichand 1604 (who died in 
1758 A. DJ. Bengal Regulation XI of 1793 recognized by 
section VI the power of a Hindu proprietor to make a will or 
declaration giving, prior or subsequent to 1st July 1794, his 
entire landed estate to his eldest son or next heir or other son or 
heir or to any person or persons. In a Bombay case the will of 
a Hindu made in 1789 is referred to 160S . A Pundit of the 
Recorder's court of Bombay gave it as his opinion in 1812 AD., 
'there is no mention of wills in our S/iastm; therefore they ought 
not to be made ' ( vide Strange's Hindu Law, vol. n p. 449 )• 
In I. L. R. (1940) 1 Cal. 415 at p. 434 the Privy Council observe 
that the Hindu will in its present form is a development since 
the middle of the 18th century. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to dilate on the modern 
Acts dealing with Testamentary dispositions such as the Indian 
Succession Act ( Act 39 of 1925 ). 

Now that the foregoing lengthy 'presentation of the ancient 
and medieval Hindu judicial procedure and substantive law has

indulged in here. The Hindu Law of pleading and evidonce

eminent Jurists and Judges as Sir William Jones, Sir Thomas 
Strange and others. For example, Sir Thomas Strange in 
• Hindu Law ' (1830) vol. I observes { at p. 311 ), " sufficient be it 
to observe that Hindu pleading was noticed with commendation 
by Sir William Jones and that, with some trifling exceptions, 
the Hindu doctrine of evidence is, for the most part, distin- 
guished nearly as much as our own, by the excellent sense that 
determines the competency and designates the choice of wit- 
nesses with the manner of examining and the credit to be given 
them ; as well as by the solemn earnestness with which the 
obligation of truth is urged and inculcated ; insomuch that 
less cannot be said of this part of their law than that it will be 
read by every English lawyer with a mixture of admiration and 
delight, as it may be studied by him to advantage. Even the 
pious -perjury which it has bsen supposed to sanction* 605 " being 
resolvable after all into no greater liberty than what our juries 
(not indeed with perfect approbation ) have long been allowed to 
take, where the life of a prisoner on trial before them is at 
stake ; credit is to be given to the pregnant brevity of the Hindu 
oath viz. 'what you know ..declare at large and with truth* (Manu 
VIIL 80 ) ; as also to the noble warning, with which the subject as 
detailed by Manu is ushered in, that ' either the court must not 
be entered by judges, parties and witnesses or law and truth 
must be openly declared' ( Manu VHL 13 )." The medieval 
digests made a very near approach to the modern ideal of 
equality of all men before the law. How even in the 20th 
century the much vaunted equality before the law of all people 
in England is far from being achieved and how it often proves 
quite illusory where the poor or the labouring classes are 
concerned is well brought out in a book entitled * Justice in 
England ' by a Barrister published by Victor Gollancz in 1938, 
especially in chapters I and VI. The Hindu jurists evolved 
tolerably clear and sound ideas about contracts, debts, deposits 
and pledges, sales, mortgages and gifts of immovable properties, 
developed a system of joint family rights and liabilities and 
laid down a peculiar law of inheritance and succession to males 
and females. The Hindu system of inheritance and succession

Manu, YajSavallja and others cited on p 353 above Sir William Jones rd 
marls (in Worts, tol.VIU p. 445, ed. o! 1807)- 'In the great system of 
contracts and the common intercourse between man and man, the Poolee 
{Po'hti) of the Indians and the Digest of the Romans are by no means 
dissimilar'.

pursues a middlo course. It does not distribute the estate of a 
deceased person simultaneously among several heirs asunder 
theMahomedan Law (where the widow, the father, mother, 
sons and daughters of a man take the estate together if they are 
all alive at the time ). Nor did the Hindu system confine the 
descont to a single person among a group of heirs of the same 
degree and sex as in the English system before 1926 ( where the 
oldest son succeeded to the real estate of an intestate person). 

It has further been seen how the ancient and medieval 
Hindu rules as to debts, adoption, partition and inheritance 
hare been moulded for over a century by Legislation and by 
decisions of the Privy Counoil and the Courts in India Many 
persons feel that the time has now arrived for the codification of 
Hindu Law. A Committee presided over by Sir B N. Rau has 
prepared a draft code which attempts to codify certain branches 
of Hindu Law From several quarters there has been vehement 
opposition to this draft code The objections raised are many. 
It is not possible to deal here with the several objections in 
detail. But some of them which raise questions of fundamental 
importance will have to be briefly stated and answered. The 
first objection is that in view of Queen Victoria's proclamation 
of 1858 the Indian Legislature should not interfere with the 
customs and usages of the people that are part and parcel of the 
Hindu religious system But this objection is hollow and 
unsubstantial and conveniently ignores what has happened 
during the last hundred years or so. All that the Queen pro- 
claimed was • ' Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of 
Christianity and acknowledging with gratitude the solace of 
religion we disclaim alike the right and the deBire to impose 
our convictions 6n any of our subjects. We desire it to be our 
royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favoured, none 
molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or 
observances; but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and 
impartial protection of the law ; and we do strictly charge and 
enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they 
abstain from all vnterference with the religious belief or worship of 
any of our subjects on pain of our highest displeasure not- 
withstanding the noble sentiments expressed here, the Indian 
Legislature both before and after the pr °olamation_ passed 
numerous laws that more or less mipingednpon or affected the 
religious theories, sentiments and practices of million* ; 01 
Hhfdus ! The following is a list of some of the WjJgJ

people have always submitted to laws passed by the Governor- 
Genetal or the Legislature that prevented them from carrying 
oat their cherished ideas and practices : Regulation XVII of 
1829 which declared the practice of Sati illegal and a crime 
punishable by the courts ; the Caste Disabilities Removal Act 
( XXI of 185Q ) ; Hindu "Widows' Remarriage Act ( XV of 1856, 
which legalises the marriages of Hindu widows notwithstanding 
any custom or interpretation of the Hindu Law to the contrary); 
the Indian Penal Code (XLV of I860, which makes sexual inter- 
course by a man with his own wife that is under thirteen years 
of age punishable as rape ) ; the Child Marriage Restraint Act 
(XIX of 1929), which makes the marriage of a male below 18 and 
of a female below 14 punishable as a crime ; the Hindu Inheri- 
tance (Removal of Disabilities) Act (XII of 1928) which Bets aside 
the Mitaksara, rules about exclusion from partition and inherit- 
ance except in the case of those that have been lunatics or 
idiots from birth ; the Hindu Law of Inheritance' Amendment 
Act (H of 1929, which enables the son's daughter, daughter's 
daughter, sister and sister's son to succeed under the Mitaksara 
in that order after the paternal grandfather and before a 
father's brother ) ; the Hindu Gains of 'Learning Act ( XXX of 
1930); the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (XVHI 
of 193?, which enables the widow of a deceased member of a 
joint Hindu family to succeed to the interest of her husband in 
the joint family property and to succeed to her deceased 
husband s separate property for the same share as that of a son ) 
The Privy Council claimed more than 70 years ago that * the 
British Government by virtue of its sovereign power asserted, 
as the former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit 
endowments of this kind (viz temples) and to prevent and 
redress abuses in their management' ( Rajah MvUu Ramaltnga v. 
Pertanayagum 1 L A 209 at p. 232 ). Non-Hindu Judges of the 
Pnyy Council and the High Courts have been interpreting and 
laymg down the Hindu Law for over a hundred years and on 
many points the law declared by them has thoroughly changed 
the law of the smrtis and digests H all this has been allowed 
to happen without hardly a demur, there is apparently no 
satisfactory or convincing reason why an elected Indian Legisla- 
ture the majority of whose members are likely to be Hindus 
should not pass an Act dealing with Hindu Law.

822 History of Dharmaiastra [ VoL 

Hindu Law by means of judicial decisions is quite satisfactory 
and there is no need of a code of Hindu Law. This objection 
merely shows that change is rather a painful process for most 
men. The present method may be a veritable El Dorado or 
paradise for lawyers and busy bodies fomenting longdrawn 
litigations One must stand appalled at the colossal expendi- 
ture of time, labour and money which must have been involved 
during the last hundred years or more in fighting out doubtful 
points of Hindu Law from the lowest court to the Privy Council. 
It not unfrequently happens that after a point had been settled 
by a Full Bench decision of a High Court and after common 
people and lawyers had followed the law thus settled for fifty 
yearB the Privy Council upsets the decision on an appeal by an 
enterprising litigant. For example, the Bombay High Court 
decided in 1879 in fiamji v. Qhaaum (6 Bom. 498 ) that the adop- 
tion by the widow of a deceased co-parcener, who had not her 
husband's express authority to adopt, was invalid, if made with- 
out the consent of the surviving cfo-parceners. But in 1933 the 
Privy Counoil held that Bamjt v. Ghamau was wrongly decided 
and that a widow can adopt without her husband's express 
authority and even in the teeth of the opposition of the sur- 
viving members of her husband's family. And when an appeal 
was made to the principle of ' stare decisis ' the Privy Council 
was pleased to observe, 'It was pressed on their Lordships that 
Ramn v. Qliamaa had been accepted and acted upon in the 
Presidency of Bombay since 1879 and that the decision should 
not be disturbed. But this is a belated appeal It should 
have been made when Yadav v Namdeo was before the Board

m j Draft Hindu code 823 

Others opine that one Code for the whole of India Jsnot 
and cannot be a practicable proposition. In support of their 
objection they rely on the existence of the several schools of law 
now prevalent in the whole of India. K India desires to be a 
self-governing political nnity in the future, there is a con> 
pelling reason why it should be governed by a single Code of 
Hindu Law, as it has been governed and will be governed m 
other substantial provinces of law by codes applicable to all 
alike. That will help in the direction of solidarity and win be 
of some use in doing away with fissiparous tendencies. There 
are really only two schools of Hindu Law. And th.e unification 
of Hindu Law will henelped by the abolition of the right by 
birth which is the cornerstone of the MitaksarS. school and 
which the draft Hindu Code seeks to abolish. Many people 
are vehemently opposed to the change But they forget that, 
what with the'rule that any member of a. joint Hindu family 
may alienate his interest for value, what with the Gains of 
Learning Act, the Hindu Women's Eights to Property Act and 
other enactments, the real cotb of the ancient Hindu family 
system has been removed and only the outer moribund shell 
remains (vide p. 604 above ) Some are opposed to giving along 
with sons a share to daughters, particularly to married daugh- 
ters. But here a compromise may be effected by allowing a 
share to unmarried daughters alone ( as Yaj 31 134 and the 
MitaksarS thereon expressly provide ). 

Another provision in the draft Hindu Code which has come 

in for severe animadversion is the provision that a -woman 

even when taking by inheritance an estate from a male or by 

partition should be held to become absolute owner thereof. In 

the first place, if a man's agnate of the 13th degree or a male 

cognate up to the 5th degree takes an estate absolutely and may 

squander it away as he pleases, one fails to see why his own 

widow should not have a like power in the 20th centwy, what- 

ever may have been the view of ancient works. In the second 

place, this objection can be met by means of a compromise, viz. 

that a widow inheriting her husband'B estate will take only a 

limited estate if at the time of her husband's death any one of 

the compact series of heirs or any direct lineal descendant of 

her husband (such as a son's daughter or daughter's daughter) 

be alive, but she will take an absolute estate if none of these

There are numerous other objections, but they are in ma&eiB

Hindu Law passed by the Indian Legislature these matters of 
detail may be adjusted to the satisfaction of most people.

Similarly serious objections are raised to the provisions of 
, the Code as regards marriages and divorce. The draft code 
proposes to do away with the prohibitions based on sameness of 
gotra and pravara. This is a desirable change and being 
optional should not be opposed Some reasons for this change 
have been advanced in H. of Dh. vol H p 498. Besides, this 
provision will affect only a small percentage of the Hindu popu- 
lation Similarly the insistence on monogamy is opposed by 
many. In this case some compromise may be arrived at as 
regards classes to whom two wives are an economic advantage 
The provisions about divorce have been overdue. Among the 
higher castes no divorce has been allowed on any ground what- 
ever. Many hard cases ooour where there is no redress and 
the draft code proposes to give relief in such cases. 

On the most contentious subject of adoption the draft code, 
it is satisfactory to note, has made certain provisions which are 
in line with the suggestions put forth by me in note 1338a above.

CHAPTER XXXII 

SADACAEA 

CUSTOMS AND MODERN CUSTOMARY LAW 160 * 

From Gautama 16060 downwards many writers dilate upon tbe 
sources of dharma. Gautama L 1-2 states: * the Veda is the 
source ( mula ) of dharma and also the tradition ( or smrtis ) 
and practice of those who know the Veda*. Similarly S.p. Dh. S. 
(11.1.1-2) says: 'we shall propound the acts (that produce 
merit) which are evolved from conventions and practices ; the 
authority ( for finding out the dharmas ) are the conventions of 
those who know the dharma and the Vedas '. Vas. L 4-7 pro- 
vides: 'dharma is declared by the Vedas and Smrtis; on 
failure of these two the practice of the sistas is the authority 
(for finding out what dharma is); a sista however is one 
whose heart is free from ( worldly ) desires and ( only ) such 
acts of sistas are ( to be held as ) dharma for which no ( worldly

or secular ) cause ( or motive ) can be assigned *. 16 °? Manu H. 
and Yaj. L 7 declare that Veda (orsruti), smrti and the 
practices of the good are the principal sources of dharma Th« 
words employed in these works are iikt, samaya, acara or sadacar 
or ii&tacara 1607 (the latter three meaning the same thing} 
Ap. employs both words viz. samaya and acara, the first of which 
probably means ' agreement or convention or usage', while the 
latter means ' custom '. The word ' custom ' now conveys the 
idea of some antiquity, 1608 while usage or convention does not 
necessarily convey that idea. A usage may be recent or it may 
be established by agreement among a certain class of persons 
C such as traders or craftsmen ) We have to see what is meant 
when it is said that acara or hstacara or sadacata is the source 
( nulla ) of dharma. An indication of the meaning is furnished 
by the word pramana employed by Ap. and VaB. The meaning 
is that just as the revealed books (Veda) and the smrtis 
authoritatively lay down what dharma is, so also in our ques* 
to find out what dharma is in the varying circumstances of life 
the practices of those who may be called sistas furnish us with 
the necessary criterion or norm i e. sistacara is the touchstone 
for judging whether an act is in consonance with what the 
sastras require us to do. The theory of the ancient writers was 
that the smrtis were based on parts of Veda ( that consists of 
mantras and Brahmana texts ) which though formerly existent 
are not now extant or available, that similarly the practices of 
those who were learned in the Vedas and were deemed to be 
sistas must be inferred to have been based on portions of Veda 
not now, available. This theory was advanced by such ancient 

1607. As to the qualifications of sistas, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 971- 
72 where references are given to Baud Dh S , Manu, the Matsyapurana and 
a few other worts. The Ta£. Up. I. 11 contains perhaps the oldest extant

writers as S.p. 16W and was taken up by many subsequent works. 
Manu H. 7 alBO states that whatever dharma has been ordained 
for any person fay Manu, all that has been entirely declared in 
the Veda for the Veda is full of all knowledge. But it does 
not follow from this nor is it ever meant that all practioes of 
sistas are authoritative in matters of dharma. The qualifica- 
tion was added that where the practices of sistas are clearly 
referable to or are prompted by a seen motive or by the desire 
to secure pleasure, there they are not authoritative. Manu 
( II. 18 ) restricted the word sadacSra to the customs handed 
down from generation to generation among the four varnas 
and the mixed castes in the country called by him Brahma- 
varta ( IL 17 ). But many other writers did not so restrict it in 
this way. 

We have to distinguish between what are called the sources 
( mula or pramUna ) of dharma and the stim-nas of dharma ( Yaj 
I 3 and 7 ). 16t0 The former indicate to the inquiring spirit 
what dharma is ( i e. they are what are called jmpdka lietu ), 
while the latter must be studied as aids by the expounders of 
dharma in order to correctly graBp what dharma is, i. e. the 
-different lores (other than Veda andsmrti) are not directly 
the sources of dharma, but are only mediately so. This distinc- 
tion is an ancient one as even Gautama XL 19 provides that 
the king is helped in his administration of justice by the Veda 
the dharmasastras, the auxiliary lores (angas), the TJpavedas 
and the Purana 1611

question whether such smrti injunctions as ' one should perform 
the AstakS sraddhas', 1613 or 'one should construct a tank or 
set up a prapa ( place for free distribution of water to thirsty 
travellers' ), or ' tufts of hair should be kept on the head ' ( at 
cmtla according to the gotra ) are authoritative and establishes 
the conclusion that the? are authoritative, since sucbsmrti 
injunctions equally with Vedic ones are addressed to the same 
persons ( viz. the followers of the Veda ) who have to aot 
according to them The idea is that those who perform the acts 
expressly enjoined by the Veda are also seen to perform the 
acts enjoined by such smrtis as that of Manu and therefore the 
principal reason why these smrtis are authoritative is the faot 
that those who know the Veda accept these smrtis as authorita- 
tive and hold fast by them, as Medhatithi on Manu JL 6 says 
citing some vers>es from his own work called Smrtiviveka 1M4 
Sabara endeavours to show that there are indications ( hnga ) in 
the Vedic texts pointing to the existence of what is prescribed in

of astakas, Bg X 4. 1 of prapas, Bg. VL 75. 17 of tufts of 
hair The objection may be Btated as follows r— The smrtis 
are composed by human authors {i. e. they are ptmruseya) 
and so have no independent authority in matters of dharma, 
as a man may say what is either false or mistaken. If it 
be said that the smrtis really propound what is Btated by 
the Veda, then they are practically superfluous and useless, 
and not being Veda they should ba- discarded ( anapeksa ) 
To this the reply is that smrtis are generally authoritative, 
as they must be held to be based on Veda because they are 
composed by men ( like Manu } who were followers of the Veda, 
because what the smrtis lay down has been consistently 
followed from generation to generation by the sistas and 
because it is possible to regard the Veda as their source. To 
the question why the Vedio passages on which the smrti rules 
are postulated to have been based aT8 not Been or found by "us 
several answers were proposed by different writers One view 
was that just as Vedic indications about locks of hair lead to 
the inference of sruti texts enjoining the keeping of tufts on 
the head, so the fact of the existence of such rules leads to the 
inference that sruti must have contained injunctions corres- 
ponding to all smrti prescriptions KumSrila raises objections 
to this view, Inference is based on perception {pratyaksa) 
and invariable concomitance {vyapfi). There is no vyapti 
between the smrtis and sruti texts that are never found pro- 
nounced by any one, so no inference is possible and it would 
be like one blind man following another. 16 " Mann must have 
composed his smrti on finding that acaryas preceding him 
performed certain acts as based on Veda These last must have 
believed that their predecessors also acted on the same belief 
Hence there is what is called an ' andha-parampara ' on this 
hypothesis And further this hypothesis of the inference of 
Sruti mall cases is opposed to perception, since as a matter of 
fact hundreds of Sruti passages are known that can he the basis 
of corresponding smrti texts Another view is ( and Kuraarila 
holds that it is somewhat better than the preceding view) that 
one should infer that the Vedic passages that were the basis of 
srartis are lost { utsanna or pralina ) Some support is lent to 
this by such Vedic texts as ' ananta vai vedah ' (Tai. Br. in 10. 

I! I. 3 2 '^ ' *" * " a ^WH* > ^Winfe p 1M on 



830 tiislory of Dharmaiadra [ Vol. 

11 ) and by £.p. Dh. S 14 12. 10. Even this view ie not 
acceptable to the Tantravartika and most of the MlmSmsakas 
The objection against the 2nd view is raised as follows. Even 
Bauddhas and other heretical sects 1616 would advance the 
argument that their works also are based on sruti texts that are 
now lost, and any one may regard anything as authoritative by 
pretending that the basic vedic texts are lost. Further the 
Mlmamsa view that the Veda is eternal (mtya) would be 
refuted if it were admitted that some portion of the Veda is lost. 
There is not much difference between the first view and the 
second view. Therefore Eumarila propounds the third view viz. 
that smrtis are to be inferred as based on Vedic texts that are 
already in existence 1617 . If an objection is raised against this 
hypothesis that it must be explained why such Vedic texts (the 
bases of smrtis) are not seen or found, the Tantravartika 
replies in a famous kariica that as the Vedic salchas (the several 
branches of the Veda) are scattered about (in various countries), 
as men ( followers of the Veda) are negligent and unmindful 
( I e they do not visit all the countries and so are unable to 
have a complete knowledge of all Vedic texts ) and as several 
rules are declared in different contexts even when occurring in 
the same sakha ( and not at one place ) it is not always possible 
to point out the Vedic sources of smrti texts. If an objector 
were to ask: 'why were not the Vedic passages themselves 
(that are the sources of smrti rules) embodied bodily into the 
smrtis,' Kumarila replies that this was not done from the fear 
of the loss of the correct arrangement of the Vedic texts as 
traditionally handed down. The Veda is principally conce rned

with sacrifices, though now and then there are rules addressed to 
men for regulating conduct only. People would only study the 
Vedic sentences contained in the srartis ( that are concerned 
principally with conduct) where they would he arranged in a 
different order according to subjects and there would thus he 
loss of the arrangement of the Veda as originally delivered. 
Visvarupa 1618 ( on Yaj.'I. 7 ) quotes the above verse of Kumarila 
and states that there are thousands of smrti rules that have 
their source in the Veda ; he and Kumarila instance the rules 
against talking with ( or coming in contact with ) a woman in 
her monthly illness or the rule against assaulting a brahmana, 
or the rule about the sin of killing an atreyl woman &c. 
Medhatithi on Manu IL 6 has an elaborate discussion on this 
very topic and quotes several verses from his own work called 
Smrtiviveka 161 '. He does not approve of the first two views and 
follows Kumarila's view. Mlmamsa writers and commentators 
like Medhatithi say that Manu and other authors of smrtis 
brought together for easy comprehension matters that are 
scattered about in the various Vedic texts, that are either not 
known to the students of the several sakhas or that cannot be 
brought together hy men of ordinary or weak intellect. 1619 " 

The general proposition that smrtis are authoritative heing 
established, a further question arises. What is to happen if a 
smrti rule conflicts with the rule of the Veda ? Jaimini deals

with this question in L 3. 3-4, 1M0 which, form a topic that states 
an exception to the general rule contained in Jai. L3.1-2. Sahara 
gives throe instances where there is apparently a conflict 
between the prescription* of the sruti and those of smrtis. The 
Veda Bays, ' the priest should chant {the stohra) after touching 
the audumbari post', while smrti says ' the whole of the audum- 
bari post should be covered with cloth'. * The Veda says 'one to 
whom a son has been born and whose hair is still dark { and has 
not turned grey) should consecrate the Vedic fires ', while smrti 
says 'a man should observe Vedic studenthood f or 48 years' 101 . 
the Veda says ' whon the Agnlsomlya rite is finished then one 
may eat (the food prepared) in the house of thesacnficer', 
while smrti says ' the food of one who has undergone diksa for 
a sacrifice may be eaten after he purchases the soma plant'. 
In these cases the proposition enunciated by Jaimini is that 'in 
case of conflict ( between an express sruti rule and a smrti rule) 
the smrti rule should be discarded, for when there is no conflict 
( wifcb an express sruti ) inference may be made ( that a smrti 
rule is baBedupon some Vedic text).' The examples may be 
explained as follows : The * audumbari ' is a post of udumbara 
planted in the sadas in the performance of the Agnistoma ; the 
Btotras (other than BahispavamSna ) are chanted near the 
audumbari post in the Badas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. 11 p 1135 for 
the fixing of the audumbara post in the sadas and p. 1185 for 
the chanting of stotras near the audumbari. IS the whole of the 
post be covered with cloth, it would not be possible to touch the 
post, but only the cloth would be touched. So there is contra- 
diction. If a man is to consecrate Vedic fires when he has a son 
and his hair is dark, he must be between about 20 and 40 (i. e a 
young man), but if a man were to ob serve brahmaoarya for

48 years, he would be about 53 to 56 years of age before lie 
married ( as the upanayana of a brShmana was to be performed 
generally in the 8th year or from the 5th. year onwards at the 
most ). Only a married man couia consecrate Yedio fireB. But 
a man's hair when he iB fiftytwo years of age or more can 
hardly be all dark. Therefore there is contradiction between 
the rule derived from the Veda and that derived from smrti. 
In the Jyotiatoma (which generally occupied five days), the 
dlksa (purification and initiation of the sacrificer) takes place 
on the first day in the afternoon ( vide H. of Bh. vol. 31 pp. 
1134-1136 ). Soma is purchased on the 2nd day of the Jyoti- 
stoma( ibid. 1140-4) and the animal is sacrificed for Agni and 
Soma on the 4th day (t&tt pp. 1158-59). According to sruti 
therefore the ■ food prepared in the house of a dlksita may be 
eaten only after the 4th day, while smrti says that it may be 
eaten after the purchase of soma on the 2nd day. In this way 
there is contradiction. Kumarila 16 * 2 does not agree with Sahara 
as regards these examples in particular and as regards the 
general attitude towards smrtis that are accepted by Vedie 
followers. He makes great efforts to explain how there is 
no real conflict in the cases cited by Sahara. As regards the i 
cloth covering the audumbari ae says that it may cover the 
bottom and the upper portion of the post and leave a space of 
two or three finger-breadths in the middle uncovered ( so that 
the audumbari post can be touched in that particular por- 
tion), that (p. 188) there is a passage in the SatySyani 

1622. The sntra (Jai. I. 3 3 ) is read as affile; or ar$rc4 and with 
both readings it has been explained in different ways from ancient times.

834 Htdory of D/iarmaiastra [ Vol. 

BrShmana whioh refers to the cloth covering the audumbail 
( and so thore may at most be an option ), that as regards 
tho taking of food in the house of a dlksita after the 
purchase of soma there in a sruti passage in the Atharvaveda 
( pp. 181 and 189 ) similar to the smrti passage ( and thus there 
is no conflict between sruti and smrti, but between sruti 
and sruti, which would lead to an option ) and further the 
Bnirti rulo may apply in the case of a man in distress ( Spad- 
dharma), that smrti does not prescribe an absolute period 
of 48 years for the study of Veda, but Baud. Dh. S. itself allows 
several alternative or optional periods and so no question of 
conflict with sruti arises. KuraSrila's own position is this : In 
the case of apparent conflicts between sruti and smrti, various 
methods of interpretation and reconciliation are possible. Eaoh 
of the two may be given its proper scope as referring to different 
subject matters ( which is called vt&nja^vyavastha ); it is also 
possible to hold that smrti is based on some sruti texts already 
existing but not found at the time of discussion, but which may 
ultimately be found, in which case there will be an option, 
though the latter jb to be avoided as far as possible as it is 
liable to eight faults (vide TantravSrtika pp. 174-175 ); or the 
two may be reconciled even when referring to the same subject 
matter e. g. a man may have dark hair even when he is 52 or 
more and the smrti may be taken as meant to refer to such a 
man, while the sruti states the general rule about the age when 
consecration of Vedic fires was to be made Therefore Kumartla 
holds that all that is meant by Jaimini and even by Sahara is 
that there is a great distinction between sruti and smrti m that 
the former iB apauniseya and an independent authority, while 
the latter has a human author ( liable to err ), is either a ° tlJ ^ 
ba B ed on the Veda or is inferred to be so based, that the two 
therefore can never be said to be quite alike each other as 
regards their authoritativeness and that lastly smrti is notm 
itself to be regarded as unauthoritative *». Kmnarila therefore 
suggests that the proper subject of discussion in ^AJT 
the works of Bauddhas, SSnkhya, Yoga, Pa ^*tf £e 
and other heretical sects and the practices rf "^JJJ 
works contain some matters such as the «a-*J»*5

generally accepted by the followers of the Veda. Phased on 
specious and false reasoning only (they are touSas rathe 
words of Manu), that they deny the authority of the Veda. 
Therefore Jaimini means that these works of, heretic sects are 
not authoritative in matters of dharma as they are opposed to 
the Veda and should be discarded. For want of space it is not 
possible to set out in detail the interesting discussion in the 
TantravSrtika. The Jaiminlya-nyaya-malSvistaTa also gives 
another explanation of Jat I. 3. 3. 

Sahara ( on Jai I. 3. 4 ) explains that the three smrti 
passages stated above are not authoritative since it is possible 
to point out how they originated in a visible woridly motive such 
as greed. When a visible motive can be pointed out for any 
smrti text, it is not proper to infer that it is based on the Veda 
and has an unseen spiritual motive. Sahara 1624 postulates the 
reasons in the way of a modern man finding fault with priests. 
Some priests covered the whole of the Audumbarl post with 
cloth, because they covete'd the cloth as part of the fee ; others 
who desired a free meal when hungry took food at the house of 
a dlksita even after he had purchased the Soma plant; certain 
others in order to conceal their absence of virility went in for 
Veda study for 48 years. The TantravSrtika tries to show that 
in all these cases there is really no visible motive such as 
covetousness ( pp. 188-189 ) 

Sahara giveB an alternative explanation of this sQtra { Jai 
1. 3.4) andmakes a separate topic (adhikarava) of it. The reasons ltes 
for giving an alternative explanation of a sutra or adliikarana are 
two, via. dissatisfaction with the explanation already given or 
the wide scope of the subject under discussion. In L 3. 3 
passages from srartis were cited which were apparently in 
conflict with sruti. If they were really in conflict, that one 
reason alone is more than sufficient to render the smrtis invalid. 
Therefore to say further that those smrti passages originate in 
worldly motives like greed does not add any very substantial 
reason for the abandonment of smrtis as authoritative. There- 
fore Sahara makes another adhikarana of sutra 4 of Jai. I 3.

He cites smrti passages which are not opposed to Teda at all 
and says that such passages have 'seen a worldly motive such 
as convetousness and it is not proper to suppose that they aw 
based on Veda and are therefore authoritative, when a visible 
purpose or motive can be ascribed to them. The result .of the 
explanations of J. 3. 3-4 given by Sahara would be that smrti 
rules that are opposed to sruti rules and' smrti prescriptions 
that can be shown to have a clear worldly motive are no* 
authoritative or absolutely binding, while the rest of emiti 
texts are authoritative. 163 * 

Sahara cites on Jai. 1.3.4 (when taken as a separate 
topic ) 1H6 <» two examples; (1) the adhvaryu priest takes ( as his 
fee ) the cloth used in the Vaisarjana homa; {%) they perform 
the gift of the elephant (i. e. the cloth covering) of this 
sacrificial post. Sahara says that these passages are not opposed 
to any sruti text but instead of inferring a Vedic text as their 
basis it is far better to hold that there is a manifest worldly 
motive for these rules ( viz. covetousness of the adhvaryu) and 
so these smrti passages need not be looked upon as authorita- 
tive. 1627 

This discussion raises an important doctrine which frequ- 
ently figures in dbarmasastra works. The doctrine is expressed

m j Rules having a vistbU purpose 837 

- in this f orm viz. when a visible motive or purpose is obvious in 
the case of a rule or prescription it is not proper to ascribe an 
unseen or spiritual purpose or reason for it. This doctrine is 
older than even- Sp. Dh. S. I 4. 12 11 which says, where men 
act because they find pleasure in so doing, there sastra has no 
scope '. Sabara also says," 28 'those rules (in the smrti) that have 
a seen purpose derive their authority from that fact, while those 
that have no visible purpose may be inferred to be based upon 
the Veda ( and derive their authority from that ).' These words 
of Sabara are quoted by Kulluka on Manu HI. 7 where Manu 
states that a girl should not be selected as a bride from a family 
that neglects the samsKaras, in which no male children are born, 
in which there is no Veda study, the members of which have on 
their bodies long and thick hair, that suffers from such diseases 
as piles, dyspepsia, epilepsy, black and white leprosy. Kulluka 
remarks that the works on medicine hold that such diseases are 
inherited and so if such a girl be married the progeny might 
suffer from these diseases, and thus this prohibition is based on 
a visible motive. From this a very important conclusion is 
drawn by dharmasSstra writers viz. if one while performing a 
rite or when engaged in any matter acts contrary. ,fco a rule that 
has a seen purpose, the rite or matter does not become invalid or 
void, while where a rule is based on an unseen or spiritual 
purpose and it is infringed, the act itself becomes void or 
invalid. Yaj J. 52 and 53 16K prescribe among other things 
that the bride to be chosen by a man must be free from ( incur- 
able) diseases, must have a brother living, must not be a 
sapmda of the bridegroom or must not have the same gotra or 
pravara as that of the bridegroom. On this the Mit. remarks 
that if a man marries a girl who is suffering from an incurable 
disease, the marriage is valid, only he does an act which runs 
counter to seen results ( i, e. he may suffer the consequence that

The Tantravartika of Kumarila has as usual a very long 
note on this discussion. He does not see eye to eye with Sahara. 
He says 1631 that the Mimamsa is concerned with the investiga- 
tion of dharma, that sruti iB the prime authority in matters of 
dharma, that MlmamsS has concern with smrtis only so far as 
their authoritativeness in matters of dharma goes, that just as 
agriculture and' the like are not disoussed in Mimamsa works 
because they have a purely secular purpose, eo all acts that 
men do for a visible worldly purpose have no bearing on the 
investigation of dharma and that therefore the bhssyakare 
(Sahara ) was not quite right in saying that such practices as 
rising to receive an old man or a teacher have a visible purpose 
and are authoritative on that ground. He further remarks that 
visible and invisible or spiritual purposes are often inextricably 
mixed up. When the Veda prescribes ' he pounds the grains 
of paddy ' or enjoins a sacrifice like the Kariri for bringing 
down rain, there is a visible purpose therein ( e. g. the rice 
grains have to be freed from husk before boiled rice for obla- 
tions can be prepared ). So even when an act has a seen purpose 
it may still have Veda as the basis; so also an act such aB 
rising to show respect to a teacher may have a seen result 
(such as the teacher being pleased teaches the pupils with 
enthusiasm ) as well as an unseen result ( viz. completion of 
Veda study without obstacles ). Therefore he argues that all

smrtis" 32 are authoritative according to the purpose they serve, 
that whatever portion of the smrtis is concerned with rffozraa and 
moksai final release from samsara ) has its origin iir the Veda 
and whatever is concerned with wealth and the satisfaction of 
desires ( artha and Kama ) is based on worldly practices. In this 
way are to be explained the didactic portions of the Maha- 
bharata and the Puranas, the episodes in these being useful as 
arllwmdas ( eulogies of what are prescribed as religious duties ), 
the description of the several divisions of the earth being 
useful for indicating what countries are suitable for the per- 
formance of dharma and the enjoyment of its rewards and 
being base'd partly on Veda and partly on direct experience. 
Similarly the auxiliary lores (a?igas) of the Veda (such as 
phonetics, grammar, metrics &c ) are partly based on the Veda 
and partly on worldly experience. Mlmamsa and Nyaya (logic) 
are necessary for the correct interpretation and understanding 
of the Veda ( as stated by Mann in XIL 105-106 ) He is even 
prepared to concede that systems 1633 like the S&nkhya ( which 
postulates a prime cause of the world called Pradhana) ,or 
Vedanta ( which postulates Purusa as the cause of the world ), 
the theory of atoms ( propounded by Kanada ) serve the purpose 
of explaining the creation and dissolution of the world, lead 
one to understand how the performance of sacrifices gives rise 
to the subtle apurva which leads on to heaven and also exemplify 
how human effort and fate have their own spheres of .operation 
( i. e without human effort the world is produced and in spite, 
of human effort it may be dissolved ). Kumarila goes a step 
farther and states that even the Buddhist philosophies of 
vtjflana ( cognitions being the only reality ), of the non-exis- 
tence of the soul or oE eternal flux arise from the arthavada

saying that in the case of all knowledge or works wherever the 
result (or reward) of the course laid down in them is to take 
place m the future and there is no possibility of experiencing 
its happening in the present such work may be deemed to be 
based on the. Veda; but where, as in the science of medicine, 
the result can be seen taking place in other people, that know- 
ledge is authoritative only because of the visible result 

This discussion about smrtis based on the Veda or on 
perceptible purposes or motives is taken up in the digests on 
dharmasastra For example, AparSrka "» ( pp. 626-627 > quotes 
long passages from the Bhavisyapurana dividing the contents 
of smrtis into five categories and exemplifying that division, viz. 
(1) those based on a visible purpose or motive, (2) those based 
on unseen or spiritual' motives or purposes, (3) those based on 
both visible purposes and unseen or spiritual purposes, (4) those 
based on reasoning, (5) those that' merely re-iterate what is 
already well-known or determined. All these except the first 
variety are based according to the Bhavisyapurana on the Veda. 
The examples of the five kinds given by the same PurSna are 
respectively as follows: (1) the smrti (viz. Arfchasastra or 
Dandanlti) in which there is a discussion about six gunas 
(sandfutice), the four upayas (sama, dana&cc), the various 
superintendents of state departments (adlitjaksa) and othantalas, 
(2) the prescription that one should perform the sandhya worship 
or that one should not partake of dog's flesh; (3) a bralimacunn

tion, which is a seen purpose, but that it should he of palasa 
and of no other tree is based on an unseen motive); (4) -when one 
text declares that homo, should be performed after sunrise and 
another declares that it should be performed before sunrise, 
reasoning requires that there should be an option ( vide Manu 
II 15), (5) when Manu declares (in VI 38) that a brShmana should 
leave home to become a wandering ascetic he simply re-iterates 
what is laid down in such Vedic passages as Br Up. Ill 5 1 
( vyutthayatha bhiksacaryam caranti ) or Jabala Up 4. 

In I. 3. 5-7 Jaimini as interpreted by Sahara 1635 deals with 
the topic of the authoritativeness of certain usages laid down 
in the smrtis in relation to Vedic rites. Sahara states : iistu 11 
say that religious rites should he performed after sipping water 
( l. e. after acamana ), one should wear the sacred thread in the 
npavita way in the worship of gods, one should do with the 
right hand all religious acts The question is whether these 
acts should he done if not opposed to the sruti or should not be 
performed if opposed to what is taught in the Veda. The put m- 
paksa view is that these acts should not be done because they 
run counter to the sequence of the aots laid down in the Veda- 
For example, the Veda says, ' after getting ready a bundle ( or 
handful ) of kusa grass called veda one should prepare the ted* 
( altar ) ' Here the preparation of the vedi is declared to follow 
immediately after the getting ready of a handful of kusas. If 
after the handful is got ready a man has a sneeze he has accord- 
ing to Manu V 145 and Vas m 38 to sip water before going 
on with the preparation of the vedi. This would be against the 
sequence ( Icrama ) of acts laid down in the Veda. Strangely 
enough Mr. K L Sarkar in T.L.L (on Mlmamsa rules) translates 
the words vedam krtva vedim karoti * as ' make the vedi and

He misunderstands the word * veda' whioh in this passage only 
means a 'handful of kusas' and inverts the sequence of the 
acts denoted by the gerundial termination ' tva '. On account 
of these two mistakes the discussion on pp 240-242 iB mislead- 
ing and obscure If a man were to do the things required in a 
vedic rite with both hands, he would be able to do them quickly 
The smrti rule that every religious act should be done with the 
right hand alone interferes with the quick performance of 
religious acts The established conclusion is that these religi- 
ous acts ( such as acamana ) are performed by the sistas, are 
prompted by no visible motive ( such as covetousness ) and are 
therefore to be looked upon as authoritative, being not opposed 
to sruti. Kumarila does not like this way of explaining the 
sutras, since the instances given by Sahara really do not 
deserve to be put forth as even prima facte opposed to Sruti. 
The Tantravartika (p. 201 ) sets out Sruti passages wherein the 
wearing of the sacred thread in the upavita form 1636 (Tai. S. II. 5. 
11. 1 and Tai Sx. II. 1 ), acamana ( Tai. 5.. H. 11 ), are enjoined 
Therefore it explains the sutras in a different way. It splits up 
Jai I 3. 5-7 into two adhikaranas. The first two constitute one 
topic The purvapaksa «» is . those precepts of Buddha and other 
founders of sects, such as the construction of monasteries and 
parks, the insistence on desirelessness, the practice of meditation, 
ohiThsa, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness, 
are such that they are also laid down by the Veda, are not 
opposed to the ideas of sistas or do not run counter to nor rouse 
those who know the Veda to anger and therefore they must be 
held to be authoritative. This is denied by saying that tne 
Bauddha doctrines even on the abovesaid matters are not to

(14 or 18} of vidyas(the four vedas, the upavedas, the angas 
of the veda, the 18 smrtis, puranas, Dandaniti ) have been 
accepted by the vedic sistas as authoritative on matters of 
dharma and the works of the Bauddhas and Jainas are not 
included therein Just as milk though originally pure becomes 
useless and unreliable when put into a bag of dog-skin, so the 
doctrines of Bauddhas such as abimsa, though based on truth, 
aTa useless and are not authoritative in themselves for the 
followers of the "Veda. 

The Tantravartika holds that Jai. L 3. 7 is an adhikarana 

by itself and is concerned with the authoritativeness of sadacai a 

( the customs and usages of sistas ). Its position is that those 

usages are authoritative that are not opposed to express Vedio 

texts, that are practised by Vedic sistas under the belief that 

they are Tight conduct ( dharma ) and for which no visible 

motive ( such as pleasure or the satisfaction of desires or the 

acquisition of wealth ) can be predicated. Sistas are those who 

perform the religious acts expressly enjoined by the Veda They 

are not so called because they practise what is said to be 

sadacara ; otherwise there will be an argument in a circle (in the 

form ' sadacara means what is practised by sistas and sistas are 

those who practise sadacara * ). The practices traditionally 

handed down from generation to generation which are observed 

by sistas ( as stated above ) with the idea that they constitute a 

part of dharma must be regarded as dharma and as leading to 

heaven %iV> Practices do not become authoritative by the mere 

fact that no such motive or purpose can be postulated for them,

transgressions of dharma and of committing desperate acts, 
that on account of their spiritual merit they did not incur sin 
but if a man of later days were to follow them in the same actB 
he would sink into hell It tnen gives twelve instances of lapses 
from good conduct (attributed even to avatars) that were trans- 
gressions and either explains them away or says that they were 
due to wrath, hatred or other passions, were not intended by the 
authors ( of those acts ) themselves to be dharma and are not to 
be looked upon as sistacara by modern men. The instances are : 
(1) Prajapati who is said to have approached Usas, bis daughter 
( Sat. Br. I. 7 4. 1 or Ait Br. 13 9 ) ; (2) Indra, who is described 
as the paramour of Ahalya ( in the Subrahmanya litany ); (3) 
Nahusa, who occupied the position of Indra, made approaches to 
Sad, the wife of Indra (Udyoga.chap. 13 ff ) and was transformed 
into an ajagoia (Boa Constrictor) ; (4) Vasistha, who when his 100 
sons were devoured by a demon, was so struck with grief that he 
threw himself bound into the Vipasa river(Nirukta IX.26, Adiparva 
chap 177 l-6=cr. ed. 167. l-6,Vanaparva 130. 8-9, Anusasana3

being devoured by wolveB ( Bg. X. 95. 14, Sat Br. XL 5. 1-8 ) 
when separated from TJrvasi ; (6) Visvamitra, who officiated as 
priest at the sacrifice of Trisanku that had become a candala 
through a curse ( Adiparva 71. 31-33 ); (7) Yudhisthira who took 
Draupadl as wife although she had been won by his younge r 
brother Arjuna by his skill in archery and who prevaricated in 
order to bring about the death of his brabmana teacher Drona 
( Dronaparva 190 55 ) ; (8) Knroa Dvaipayana ( Vyasa ), who 
thought himself a perpetual student, procreated by myoga at 
the request of his mother SatyavatI two sons on the widows of

^, h 7^fa««dBukmm 5 and SubhadrS respectively who 
were their maternal uncle's daughters (such marriages being 
forbidden ). Kumarila, like a modern comparative mycologist! 
explains ( Tantravartika p. 208 ) that Piajapati means « the San • 
Who approaches (i e. rises after ) the Dawn. This explanation 
is as old as the Ait Br. 13. 9 where it is said that there are two 
views viz. it is either * Heaven ' or ' Usas ' that is meant by the 
word 'daughter.' Similarly Indra and Ahalya respectively 
mean the Sun and the Night and jam means literally 'one who 
makes to disappear or wither away ' (and not paramour) in that 
passage. Vide H. of Dh. vol II. p. 1145 note 3550 for the epi- 
thet 'Ahalyayai jara' in the Veda and quotation from Tantra- 
vartika The story of Ahalya and Indra varies in its details in 
the epics. Vide Bamayana I. 48, Udyoga 12. 6 These two are 
instances of transgression of dharma (dharma-vyatikrama)and 
the next case of Vasistha is an example of saliasa (through 
sorrow) Kumarila says that Visvamitra was piomptedbybis 
hatred of Vasistha and his pride, that the sin accruing from Mb 
act would be neutralized by his great austerities. So hie 
actions cannot serve as a model for imitation by others. Vyasa, 
who was a son of SatyavatI from Parasara when she waB a 
maiden, had Vicitravlrya as ( his uterine ) brother after Satya- 
vatI married Santanu. In the case of a brahmaoarin, sexual 
intercourse is most reprehensible ( vide H of Dh. vol. It p 374) r 
But Vyasa agreed to rnyoga because of his regard for hiB mothe, 
as allowed by Gaut 18 4-5. Kumarila adds that VyaBa could 
do so on account of his great past and future austerities, that 
another person with similar qualifications may do so even in 
spite of all prohibitions, since the Mahabh&rata ( Asramavaaika 
30. 24 ) says ' sarvam balavatam pathyam ' ( to the strong every- 
thing is wholesome or allowable) He gives an apt illustration. 
An elephant can devour branches of trees without harm, but 
others doing so would meet death. Daksa V.10 prescribes 'anafra- 
mlnatistheta ksanamekamapi dvfjah' (a twice-born person 
should not stay even for a moment unattached to some Sarama). 
Bhlsma remained unmarried out of filial devotion to his father 
and Bama could not think of another wife as he was so mu* 
attached to Sits. Kumarila boldly asserts that Z™*™}™* 
wife only for the purpose of the sacrifices he perf brme d («' 
this is mentioned in no Itibasa or Furana ) and relies «P™ the

inode of proof called arlhapatti for this 164 * . His word8 are given 
below. This and some other explanations offered by Kumarila 
shed a vwy interesting light on the theological apologetics of 
Mlmamsakas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. XL pp. 558 and 684 for Rama 
and the golden image of Site As to Yudhisthira's bringing 
about the death of his brahmana teacher the explanation is that 
the former performed Asvamedha after the end of the war by 
way of prayascitta ( vide H. of Dh. vol. 11 p. 147 n 333 and pp> 
1236-37 notes 2674-75 for Asvamedha as the re mover of all sins). 
As to Draupadl being the wife of five brothers Kumarila quotes 
Adiparva 198. 14 ( =ot ed. 190 14) and offers several explana- 
tions ( p 209 ), the most astounding being that there were five 
wives of the five brothers who were so similar that they were 
all referred to as one. As the Hyayasudha, (p. 194) remarks, 
these various explanations were offered to show off great re- 
sourcefulness of interpretation ( parihara-vaibhav3rtham ), 
the proper one being that the practice of the Fandavas was an 
evil one and was not to be imitated. A blind man could not 
perform sacrifices and was excluded from inheritance. Vide H. 
ofDhyol. IL p. 157 n. 369 and vol. EI. p 609 n 1154. But 
Kumarila says that as Dhrtarastra -was blessed with sight for a 
while and saw his deceased Bons through the miraculous power 
ofVyasa(Asramavasiparva chap. 32-37) he might have been 
endowed with sight at the time of the sacrifices or what is 
meant is that he made gifts which are spoken of as sacrifices- 
As regards Subhadra, Kumarila asserts that in spite of the fact 
that Subhadra was said in the Adiparva (219. 18 = cr ed 211 
18 ) to have been the daughter of i Vasudeva and mter of Kama! 
she was really the daughter of Krsna's step-mother's sister or 
the daughters daughter of the sister of his step-mother's father 
Ufemaismmbewg often called a sister among the Latas). 
VideH.ofDh TO 1. IL pp. 459-460 and notes to my edition of 
the text of V. Mayukha ( pp. 200-202 ). Krsna's marriage with

ing that Khandadeva states that it is nowhere found that 
Subhadra was the daughter of Vasudeva Probably he bad a 
corrupt reading of the Mahabharata passage before him As to 
the charge of drinking spirituous liquor (vbhau madhtasa- 
vaksibau in Udyogaparva 59. 5 ) against both Vasudeva and 
Arjuna, they were both ksatriyas and only brahmanas were 
prohibited from drinking any kind of intoxicating drink ( Gaut 
IL 25 ), while to ksatriyas and vaisyas two kinds of wine called 
madbu ( liquor from honey or madhuka flowers) and sldbu (rum ) 
were allowed and only paisti ( spirituous liquor distilled from 
flour ) was forbidden ( by Gaut. E. 25, Manu XL 93-91 ). 

Kumarila offers some ptber explanations of Jai 16 " I 3 5-7 
which need not be set out here. 

Kumarila mentions certain practices of his times and 
concludes that they are to be condemned and not to be followed 
or regarded as authoritative. He says: 1645 even in these days 
brahmana women of Ahicchatra and Mathura drink wine; 
northerners ( northern brahmanas )" engage in such transactions 
as the gift and sale of horses and mules that have a mane, assos,

camels and animals with two rows of teeth and eat from the 

B ame plate with their wires, children and friends; brahmanas of 

the south enter into matrimony with the maternal uncle's 

daughter and take their meals while seated on a couch (of 

wicker work); both (brahmanas of the north and south) take 

cooked, food (kept in pots) that remains after their friends or 

relatives have partaken of it or that has been touched by them 

(at the time of eating); they chew betelnut leaves that have 

been touched by persons of all varnas, do not perform sipping 

of water ( acamana ) at the end of the chewing of betelnut, wear 

clothes washed by washermen and brought on the back of asses ; 

they do not avoid contact even with persons guilty of grave 

sins ( except of brahmana murder ). There are everywhere an 

infinite number of very obvious transgressions of the subtle 

dictates of dharma laid down for each man, caste or family, 

"that (transgressions ) are contrary to sruti, smrti and each other 

and that have a visible purpose behind them. It is not possible 

to regard such practices as authoritative * Similarly Varadaraja, 

(1600-L660 A. D.) a pupil of Bhattojl Diksita, in his work styled 

the Glrvanapadamafijari in a dialogue between a Kanyakuhja 

brahmana and a sannyasm hailing from VtjayanagaTa makes 

the brahmana host say that each country has certain practices 

which are rfwrScaj-os such as marrying a maternal uncle's 

daughter in the south, marriage of girls among southerners 

even before they aTe four years old, sitting down to a meal 

without bathing in Karnataka, in Maharastra-the marriage 

of a younger brother before an elder one, in the hilly country 

the practice of myoga ( vide Mr. P. K. Gode's interesting paper 

in ' Bharatlya-vidya 'vol VI pp &7-30 ). 

According to Sahara, Jaimini in I. 3. 8-9 deals with certain 
words like yam, varaha and velasa, that have different signi- 
ficances among Sxyas and Mlecchas ( and therefore these sutraB 
constitute what is called yavavarahadhikarana ). But Kumarila 
does not like this view of Sahara and proposes another topic for 
these two sutras, viz. the relative strength of smrti and sadacara 
where they are in conflict. Here there are three 1 " 6 possible

views, viz. that both are equally strong and so there is an option 
in case of conflict, that acara is stronger, that smrti is the 
stronger of the two The prima facie view is that both are 
equally strong, since smrti and sadacara are both inferred to be 
based upon Yeda. Kurnarila's own final conclusion is that 
smrti is of greater force than acara, that is, where they come in 
direct conflict smrti should prevail. His position is that, though 
both smrti and acara are to be deemed to be based on Yeda, 
there is a difference between the two. People have full faith in 
such smrtis as that of Manu and Manu and others are believed 
to have been inspired sages and are the propounders of the rules 
of dharma scattered about in various Vedic sakhas, while the 
same cannot be said about modern men and their practices 
cannot claim or possess the same weight and allegiance that 
the practices laid down by Manu and other sages can. Irom 
the practice of sistas one may infer a smrti as the root thereof 
and then further one may infer a sruti as the root 01 the smrti. 
Therefore acara is removed by two stages from the Veda, while 
smrti is removed only by one stage from the Veda. Hence 
Kumarila says that in case of conflict smrti should prevail over 
acara. The practices that are discussed here ( ace. to Kumarila, 
Parthasarathi and others ) are such as the marriage with a 
maternal uncle's daughter or with a paternal aunfs daughter and 
the like that are in vogue among certain people and that are yet 
opposed to smrtis (suoh as Manu XL 171-73) and for which a 
visible motive oan easily be found ( IcamMihetoantamm spasla- 
mem dr&ijate, as the Sastradlpika says ). 

Kumarila gives another (and so a third ) explanation of 
Jai. I 3. 8-9 1617 which need not detain us here. _

■QI ] Uolakadhikarana 851 

Jai I 3. 15-23 constitute what is called Holakadhikarana, 
or SamanyasrutikalpanadhikaTana. The first two and the last 
two sutras are the most important. Certain practices 1 * 48 like 
the Holaka (spring) festival are observed by the easterners, 
certain others like Shninaibuka (worship of growing Karanja 
or Arka or other trees as handed down in one's family ) by the 
southerners, and the Udvrsabhayajna ( honouring oxen on the 
lull Moon of Jyestha and making them run a race) by the nor- 
therners. The question is whether, in making an inference 
about these practices being based on Veda, one was to suppose that 
the inferred Vedic text also should be restricted to the easter- 
ners and the like 1619 . The purvapaksa view is that the sruti to 
be inferred as the basis of the respective practices must be 
deemed to be restricted to certain persons only ( Buch as the 
easterners i. e. praajas &c. ). The established conclusion is that

such practices must be deemed to be meant fnr »u „,-„» «. 
general rule about vedic injunctions is Zl^SZ 
toalL The performer specially meant by ** VeSSESJ 
» known in either of three ways «so viz . by C3pab a ^J* 

attribute. When it is said 'svargatemo yajeta' then only the 
three twice-born classes are meant, for, they alone are capable 
of tending the sacred fires and of possessing Vedic learning 
sndasudra is not a fit person to whom that injunction can 
apply. Those who are guilty of grave sins (pattta) and the 
impotent are prohibited from performing Yedic rites. When 
the Veda says ' iSja rajasuyena yajeta ' there is aBpeoial attribute 
of the performer ( viz. being a ksatriya ) prescribed by the sruti 
and so no one else can perform BSjasuya. When none of these 
three exists a Vedio udhi is in general meant for all (sarvadharma). 
The practices of Holaka, Vrsabhayajfia and the like should not 
be held to be restricted to certain countries or people only, but 
should be inferred to be applicable to all. When a man leaves 
the east and goes to the south, he may still perform the Holaka 
festival ; while a man from the eastern country itself may not 
perform it at all. Further the words 'southern, eastern and 
northern * are relative. A country that fa called southern may 
be to the north of another. Therefore Holaka and other practices 
are not invariably concomitant with particular countries or 
peoples. Nor can it be said that those practices require those 
particular countries for their performance in the way in which 
sruti expressly requires the Vaisvadeva rite (one of the four 
cSturmasyas ) to be performed on a spot that slopes towards the 
east. The Tantravartika 165 ' points out that persons receive 
appellations from names of countries on various grounds as 
being born in a country or as residing therein or as coming 
from that country or as going to that country. Medhatithi on 
Manu VHI. 46 says the same.

HI] Authontatweness of Grhya and Dhmma suhas 853 

The Tantravartika explains that the first two sutras are 

meant to refer to another question also, viz. whether the rules of 

the grhyasutras 1652 and of such dharmasutra works as the sutra 

of Gautama are authoritative only as to certain groups or are 

meant to he authoritative for all He hegins hy saying that 

the Puranas, the Manusmrti and Itih&sa ( i. e the Mahabharata) 

are equally authoritative for all people and then points out that 

the Gobhila-grhya and Gautama-dharmasutra are traditionally 

accepted hy the students of the Samaveda, that the dharmasutra 

of VaBistha is accepted by the students of the Rgveda, the sutra 

of Sankha-Likhita by the followers of the white Yajurveda and 

the sutras of Apaetamba and Baudhayana by the followers of 

the Taittirtya Sakha. The Sastradlpika explains that an author 

who was a student of the Samaveda taught his own work to his 

pupils who also learned the Samaveda under him, that these pupils 

in their turn taught that work to others and in that way there 

arose a tradition among the students of the Samaveda to study 

the sutra of Gautama. Therefore, to say even as to grhya 

works that they are restricted to particular groups of persons is 

not correct Similarly in the case of practices there is no 

epithet or attribute that is common to all those who practise 

them or which distinguishes those who do not observe them 

from those that observe them and therefoie it is not possible to 

restrict such practices as Holalca to particular countries or 

groups of people. 

The requisites of valid customs as laid down by the emi- 
nent writes* of the Purva-mlmamsa school may now be sum- 
marised Such customs must he ancient, must not be opposed 
to the express texts of the Yeda or of smrti, must be such as to 
be regarded as obligatory by the sistas and must be observed

writers did not lay down anything about the binding character 
of usages that wore peculiarly secular but restricted their 
remarks to customs and u B ages that had more or less an unseen 
or spiritual purpose Khandadeva emphasizes this by stating 
' only those customs can be deemed to be based on the Veda 
that aro not opposed to the Veda and smrtis and that are obser- 
ved by respectable people under the belief that thereby they are 
carrying what dharma dictates' 1651 . Medhatithi on Manu"»

Rumania ' a emrti that is opposed to the Veda or is self-contra- 
dictory, or haB a visible secular purpose or expressly states a

CHAPTER XXXIII 

CUSTOMS AND DHARMASASTRA WORKS 

It is now necessary to see bow DharmasSstra works have 
dealt with the authority and binding force of customs and 
usages. Sadacura is defined by HSrlta as follows 165 ' .— the 
word' eat' means 'good' and the good are those who are free 
from (moral) taint; the practices of such people are called 
mdacara. Vide Manu H. IS, which also defines sadacSra. 
Even the most ancient sutras testify to the fact that numerous 
customs and usages had arisen in different countries and vil- 
lages. The Asv. gr. ( L 7. 1-2 ) says, 1658 ' various indeed are the 
observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should 
follow those in marriages; what, however, is common (to all 
or most ) shall be declared by us '. The Sp. gr. ( IL 15) declares, 
' people should understand from women what procedure is to be 
observed (according to custom)* and the Ap Dh S. provides 
(1.7. 20. 8=11. 11. 29 14) that one 1659 should regulate ones 
course of action ( in difficult or doubtful matters) according to 
the conduct which is unanimously approved of in all countries 
by the Aryas ( men of the three higher castes ), who have been 
properly disciplined, who are aged, who have restrained then- 
senses and who are neither covetous nor hypocritical and con- 
cludes with the aphorism (IL 11. 29.15) 'some teachers hold 
that the rest of the dharmas (not set out in this work) may ^ 
understood from women and from men of all castes . W

gr.I.4.6) refer to the practices of people that should be followed 
in such matters aB commencing agricultural operations, holi- 
days &o. It is needless to set out these in detail here. Manu 1661 
IV. 178 pronounces the general prescription for all men, 'one 
should walk in the path of good men which their fathers and 
grandfathers trod -, by so doing one will come to no harm * 
For ordinary men this procedure is easy to understand and to 
follow This dictum Bets a premium on the attitude of no change 
in any matter for fear that change may lead to some unexpected 
harm and has been throughout the ages up to the present the 
motto of most people in India. Ab acara or sadacara is tangible 
and requires no effort to decide between conflicting views, we 
find eulogies of it in the earliest smrtis and puranas. Vide 
Manu IV. 155-158, Vas. VI. 6-8 (the first and last of which are 
the same as Manu IV. 157-158), Anusasanaparva 104. 6-9, Visnu 
Dh. S 71. 90-92 ( which are almost the same as Manu IV. 155, 
156, 158 ), Markandeya chap 34, Brahmapurana 121. 6-9, Visnu- 
purana 1IL chapters 1 1-12, KurmapurSno, (uttarSrdha, chap 15). 

The general rule about the binding character of customs is 
set out as follows Gaut (XI. 20) observes, 1KJ 'the dharmas 
(customs) of countries, castes and families, which are not 
opposed to the Vedic scriptures, are authoritative and binding ' 
Gaut provides in the next two sutras that cultivators, traders, 
herdsmen, money-lenders and artisans can lay down conven- 
tions or usages that would be binding on the respective classes, 
that when a dispute arises as to these usages the king should 
learn affairs from those who wield authority over those classes 
and decide the dispute accordingly Vas 1.17 states, ' Manu has 
declared that the (peculiar) customs of countries, castes and 
families may be followed in the absence of mles propounded 
by the Veda", and in XIX. 7 prescribes that the king should

appear* to lay torn that the customs of countries and families 
( if not opposed to Veda) are authoritative and are to be follow 
od in the respective countries or families. But this view seems 
to bo unacceptable to Baudh Dh. S (J. 1.19-M) which 
•Miys, ,( " tlioro is difference of opinion regarding five (practices) 
in the South us well as in the North We shall explain those 
peculiar to the south. They are- to eat m the company of (in 
Hie tamo plate with ) one whose upanayana in not performed, to 
ont in tlio company of one's wife, to partake of stale food, to 
marry the daughter of a maternal uncle or of a paternal aunt. 
Nov ( the customs peculiar ) to the north are : to sell wool, to 
drink rum, to deal in the Bftle of animals with an upper and a 
lower row of teeth, to follow the profession of arms and to travel 
?jy wa He who follows (these practices) in any other country 
than where they are generally in vogue commits sin. For, in 
respect of thcfc customs the authoritativeness must be lestricteil 
f the respective countries Gautama declares that this is false. 
And one should not appiove of ( accept ) either ( of the two sets 
ot practices ), because they are opposed to the tradition of sistats 
(or opposed to the smrtis and the views of sistas)'. The 
Tantravartika 1664 (p 311 ) mentions the argument of some con- 
oerning these passages of Ap and Baud viz. that Apastamba's 
very general statement that practices of countries and families 
are authoritative in the respective countries cannot be accepted

Baud, expressly state* that certain practices though prevalent 
in certain localities cannot ha accepted as valid and binding 
even in those localities because they are opposed to the express 
words of such authoritative and highly venerated smrt is ( a? 
those of Manu ) Manu in several places provides for the enfor- 
ceability of customs and usages. In Manu VH. 203 it is said, 
' the conqueror should hold as authoritative and binding Uie 
lawful customs of the conquered country, just as they are stated 
to be' and in Manu Vm. 41 and46 166s it is provided, 'A king 
who knows dharma ( sacred law ) should carefully inquire into 
the customs of castes, of countries, of guilds and of families 
and settle ( or enforce ) the customs peculiar to each Whatever 
may have been practised by the good and by twice-born men 
devoted to dhaima, that shall be established (by the king) a^ 
the law, provided it be not opposed to the ( customs of ) coun- 
tries, families and castes '. Medhatithi adds that tbe king has 
to see whether the customs of countries, families, castes and 
guilds are directly in conflict with the Veda or are harmful to 
others or utterly immoral ( such as marrying one's mother) and 
only those that are found not to be so are to be enforced by the 
king and he ,CS4 adds on Manu II 6 that the practices of sis>taB

860 -History of Dharmaiastra [ Vol. 

relies^ upon the words of the MahabhSrata ( Vanaparva 313. 
117 ;, what is true dharma is concealed a 3 in a dark cave; the 
(only) path is to follow great men'. In 1. 118 Mann declares 
that the ancient (or long enduring) laws (or customs) of 
countries, castes, families and the rules among heretics and 
companies (of traders and the like) have been dealt with by 
him in the saBtra (Institutes). Yaj. I 343 provides that when 
a conqueror reduces a country to subjection he should preserve 
intact whatever customs, laws and Judicial procedure, and 
family usages are handed down from generation to generation 
therein ( provided they are not opposed to sastras and, as the 
Mit. says, he should not oause confusion by imposing the us- 
ages of his own country on the conquered country). Yaj. 21. 192 
( like Manu and Gaut. ) provides that the varying usages and 
conventions of srenis (guilds of artisans), naigamas (traders), 
heretics and associations ( of soldiers and the like ) should be 
respected by the king in the same way as he honours the usages 
of learned brahmanas. About the latter Yaj. H. 186 says that 
the king should sedulously enforce the conventions of learned 
brahmanas which are not opposed to the dictates of the Veda 
and smrti (such as about pastures, water-courses and wells and 
the preservation of temples) and he should also enforce his edicts 
that are not opposed to Veda and smrti ( such as making pro- 
vision for travellers and prohibiting the sale of horses to an 
enemy &c. ). Kautilya prescribes 1668 that the king should 
follow as regards inheritance and partition the customs that are 
in vogue in a country, a caste, a sangha (company or guild) or 
a village. Devala 1669 and BrhatparSsara (X. p. 381) have a verse 
very similar to Yaj L 343. The Mahabharata remarks that 
there is no custom or praotice that can be said to be beneficial

otherwise the subjects become irritated and disaffected and there 
is loss of wealth and army. He gives certain striking illus- 
trations of peculiar practices: 'members of the twice-boru 
classes in the southern countries take in marriage their mater- 
nal uncle's daughter; in the middle country (the country 
between the Himalaya and the Vindhya lying to the west of 
Pray&ga and to the east of, Vinasana where the SarasvatI dis- 
appears, as said by Manu IL 21) artisans and menial workers 
eat the flesh of a cow; in the eastern countries people ( all in- 
cluding brahmanas ) eat fish and women are given to adultery; 
in the north women drink liquor and contact with them even in 
their monthly illness is allowed ; the people of the Khaia country 
take as wives the widows of their own brothers ; theBe several 
people are not liable to undergo punishment or penance because 
of their doing these things in the respective countries'. Medie- 
val writers differed about the meaning of the last half verse. 
The Madanaratna said (aoc. to V. P. p 22) that there is neither 
punishment nor prayascitta when the above practices which are 
opposed to smrti texts are indulged in by the inhabitants of the 
countries specified, while the Y. P. p. 22" holds that there is only 
absence of punishment at the king's hands for these people in 
those countries, but they are still liable to undergo prayascitta 
and that if these practices are followed in other countries both 
punishment and prayascitta have to be undergone

862 ffisfow of DharmaiSstra [ Vol. 

KSt. 1 * 73 defines what is meant by the customs of countries 
and families and states how and when they are to be enforced.- 
'That is said to be the custom of a country, which is in vogue 
in a country, is of long standing and is not opposed to the Veda 
and timrti That is called family custom which has come down 
hereditarily in a family as right conduct (dharrna) to b« 
observed ( by members of that family ) ; the king should pre- 
serve it as it is. ' In disputes between the residents of the same 
country or capital, hamlet of cowherds, town or village the 
decision should be based on their own conventional usages, but 
in disputes between inhabitants of these and others the decision 
must be in accordance with the sacre'd texts Therefore the 
king should decide the causes of people according to the rules 
of sastra : but in the absence of texts he should carry out { the 
administration of justice) according to the usage of the conn- 
try Whatever conventions are settled in accordance with the 
consent of ( the people of a ) country should always be preserved 
in writing sealed with the royal seal. Such convention* should 
be sedulously upheld as if they were the dictates of sastra and 
the king should decide (disputes) after carefully consider- 
ing them ' Here Kat is principally concerned with the 
decision of legal disputes on the basis of the customs of 
countries and families, but his rules also have a general 
application. He also states that in the case of the conflict of 
laws by which the parties are governed sastra prevails Pit*" 
maba 1613 has a similar verse about the usages of towns, villages 
and guilds and mentions that Br held the same view. Mami

ladhyadesa). But Medh&tithi mentions other local usages 
at are opposed to smrti e g grain is lent in spring and in the

Very difficult questions arise in regard to the relative force 
E sruti, smrti and sadacSTa and numerous rules have been laid 
awn in cases of apparent and real conflicts among them. As 
.ami n. 6, Yas I. 4-5 and Y&3 I. 1 mention the sources of 
hamia to be sruti, smrti and sadacara in that order, the Mitak- 
w5 remarks 5674 that ' in case of conflict, each preceding one of 
lose three has more force (or binding character) than each 
ncceeding one.' Sruti or Veda is recognised by all smrti writers 
s the highest or supreme authority {or those who desire to know 
/hat dharma 1675 is (vide Manu II. 13 and Yaj. 1. 40 ). If two 
r edic_texts of equal authority are in conflict, then Gaut 1676 I 5, 
danu U. 14 and Jsbali declare that there is an option. For 
ixample, there are two Vedic texts ' he takes the sodasin cup in 
he Atiratra sacrifice' and 'he does not take the sodasin cup in 
he Atiratra*. In this case there is an option Similarly Vedic 
;exts say that the daily Vedio agnihotra may be performed 
after sunrise, or before sunrise or when neither the sun nor stara 
we visible. Therefore there is an option, viz. the daily agni- 
hotra offering may be made at any one of the three times speci- 
fied ( Manu IL 15 ). But a vedic text which is in apparent con- 
flict with another is not always of equal force with that other. 
In such a ease there is no option, and various rules are laid

had to admit that what was laid down by sruti texts was set 
aside or contradicted or abandoned by smrti texts or by popular 
sentiment After the TTdayanlya (concluding isti) in the Agni- 
stoma sacrifice was finished, a rite was prescribed by Vedic texts 
in which a barren cow (called Anfibandhya) was sacrificed for 
Mitra and Varuna But later on this was condemned and in 
lieu of a cow amiksa ( mixture of heated milk and curds ) was 
substituted. Vide ft. D II pp 1200-J201 for the anubandhya 
cow and p. 628 n 1198 above for the verse quoted by the Mit. on 
Yaj. H, 117 condemning cow sacrifice in Kaliyuga. Yaj, HI. 
234 puts govadha ( slaughter of a cow ) at the head of upapa- 
takas. Medhatithi on Manu IV. 176 after stating that even 
such acts as donating all one's property in the Visvajit sacrifice 
or killing a cow should not be done (though sanctioned by the 
Veda) remarks that he gives that explanation following his 
predecessors' views but that to him it appears that an express 
sruti text cannot be set aside by a smrti passage 1679 . Visvarfipa 
also ( on pp. 25-26 ) after adverting to the fact that Yaj HI 234 
places govadha at the head of Upapatakas remarks that this may 
apply to the killing of cows spoken of in smrtis such as at the 
time of samavartana ( vide Mann HI. 3 ) and that the rule must 
ba upheld that a smrti that is in conflict with an express text 
of the Veda is to be set aside. Sometimes even a smrti text 
though theoretically weaker than sruti was allowed to prevail 
over a sruti. For example, the Veda prescribes the filling of the 
cups of wine in Sautramani isti, but this is one of the matters 
prohibited in Kali'* 80 (vide chapter on Kalivarjyas below). 

The general rule is that when a custom or usage is opposed 
to the text of the Veda the latter must prevail So early a 
writer as Apastamba states this rule emphatically in several 
places. In Ap. Dh. S. 1 1. 4. 8 it is stated 1681 : 'For, an ex- 
plicit sruti test has greater force than acara (usage) from 
which a sruti text (on which it may be supposed to be based )

clarified butter, milk, potsherds ( in conjunction ) with the wife 
and accompanied by loudly or inaudibly recited ( mantras ) 
must be performed and that a usage opposed to these rites is 
without authority*. In spite of this and the doctrine of the 
Purvamlmamsa stated above (p. 843) usages sprang up that 
were opposed to or gave the go-by to the prescriptions of the Veda 
as will appear a little below and particularly in the section on 
Kalivarjya 

The conflict of smrtis among themselves presents much 
greater difficulties. From very ancient times authors of smrtis 
differed greatly among themselves. A few striking examples 
may be cited. Ap. Dh S. ( L 6. 19 2-12 ) cites the views of ten 
predecessors on the question of the persons whose food may be 
partaken of by a brShmana {ha aiyanruOi). The difference 
between Gautama and Baudhayana on the one hand and Ap. on 
the other on the question of the validity of certain usages in 
certain localities has already been referred to (p 858). In 1U » 
Manu mentions three views ( and four sages ) on *»««*«£ 
the position of a brahmana who marries a sudra mfc ■ « »» 
sonorachildfromher. Baud. Dh. S. I. 8 2, Manu ffl. 13, Visnu

tion may take the form of holding that one text lays down a 
general rule and the other lays down a special rule (whiohprevails 
over a general rule ), or the text may be held to relate to diffe- 
rent sets of circumstances or in the last resort it may be held 
that there is an option, but in arriving at these conclusions the 
practice of the old or of siatas who follow the rule in one text 
and discard or avoid the rule in the other text is the guide 1683 . 
Br. WM gives the following warning to those who do not take 
reasoning into consideration : ' The decision ( in a cause ) should 
not be given by merely relying on sastras, for in the case of a 
decision devoid of reasoning Iobs of dharma results'. Nar. 
( I. 40 ) provides in a strain similar to the Mit , ' when there is 
conflict between two texts of dharmasastra, it is declared that 
the method to adopt is to resort to reasoning/ for the practices 
( of sistas ) are of great force and the strict letter of the law is 
overruled by them (ot properly understood through them)'. 
These provisions remind us of the working of the principle 
of wqutUis applied by the praetors in Rome to the rigid older 
legislation or the influence of Equity in English Law. When

old rules become too narrow or are deemed, to be not in harmony 
with the views of a changing or progressive society, it was 
thought to be the privilege of the king or the judge to adopt his 
praotice to the existing state of society and not to decide a case 
by a too strict adherence to ancient dicta. 

Another rule that was laid down was that in case of con- 
flict between dharmasastra and arthasSstra, the former is of 
more weight or authority or that one should discard the rule in 
the ai-thasastra 1685 ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 9 24. 23 ; Y«j. H. 21 ; Nar. I. 
39 ; Kafc. 20 ) Vide pp. 8-9 above for an explanation of thiB 
rule The rule of the arthasastra has the accomplishment of a 
visible or worldly purpose as the goal, while the dharmasastra 
rule has as its purpose the securing of unseen or spiritual results. 
Therefore the latter from a spiritual or ethical point of view is 
superior to the former. 

Several other methods of resolving conflicts between smrtis 
maybe mentioned here. Br. 1686 states: 'Manustnrti occupies 
a pre-eminent position because it puts together the purport of 
theVedas; thatsmrti which is in conflict with the purport of 
Manu is not commended*. Angiras also stateB that to follow 
the words (of another smrti) disregarding the unrivalled 
dharmasastra of Manu would not be beneficial to a person. Ibe

promulgated by Manu, in Treta. those of Gautama, m Dvapara 
those of Sankba-Likhita and in Kali those of Parasara This 
also did not solve all difficulties, since the medieval digests and 
commentaries found that even what was allowed by Parasara 
came to be disapproved of or condemned by the people: Many 
prescriptions of the smrtis were therefore included under Kah- 
variya (acts forbidden in the Kali age) on the ground that action, 
though at one time prescribed or sanctioned by the s&stra, 
should not be resorted to, if it has become hateful to the people, 
since it would not lead to heaven 1689 (if persisted in). This 
was the dictum of Yaj. L 156 { = Brhan-Naradiya-puraha 24, 12 ), 
Manu IV. 176, Visnu Db, §, ( 7L 84-85 ), the Visnupurana (HI. 
11. 7 ), §ukra HI 64, Barhaspatya-satra ( on ArthasSstra ) V. 16,

for prohibiting certain acts (though done in former times ) by 
theMit. (on Yaj. 31 117, UL 18), V. P. (p. 442) and others. 
But these devices of interpretation also proved futile in certain 
cases. On the question of the periods of mourning due to death 
for ksatriyas and others the texts are go various and so conflic-

be useless to do so in view of the fact that the usage of sistas

Madhava in Par. M. on 1 1. p. 84 ) were aware that peopl e would 
not go in for religious practices that called for great effort and 
would seek for such rules as would be easy of observance 1W1 

1 In some cases it was provided that where there is a conflict 
among smrtis the view of the majority should prevail Gobhila- 
smrti ( III 148-149 ) provides 1692 that where there is a conflict 
among passages ( of smrtis ), authoritativeness rests with that 
view which is supported by a majority of the texts, but whose 
two passages are of equal authority then reasoning has to be 
employed. The assumption or axiom was, according to Medha- 
tithi 1693 ( on Manu H. 29 and XL 216), Mit (on HI 325), Sm C. 
(I. p. 5), Apararka p. 1053, Madanapanjata (pp.11, 91) and 
others that all smrtis form one sastra, that if some srarti texts 
on the same subject are in conflict there is an option and when 
there is no conflict all rules from all smrtis should beheld 
applicable to the subject matter; this was based on the analogy 
of the maxim called 'sarva-sakhapratyayanyaya* or'aakban- 
taradhikarana * ( vide Jai. H. 4. 9 and Sahara thereon ) 

It is further provided that works of heretical sects were to 
be left out of consideration. Manu calls them smrtis, but they 
are outside the pale of Vedic orthodoxy. Manu lf&™> 
declared," 9 * 'the smrtis that are outside the ( pale of ) Veda 
and all false or fallacious doctrines are of no avail after death, 
Because they are all based on ignorance \ In the Vedantasutra 
(H. 1 1) also the word smrti is applied to the works on the

HI] Heretical works have no authority 871 

Sankhya philosophy. The Tantravartika ( p. 195 ) says that 
the Bauddhas and other heretical sects do not admit that their 
doctrines are based on the Veda, like a bad son hating his 
parents ; the prescriptions contained in their -works are opposed 
to all the 14 mdyas except in the case of a few sentences laying 
down restraint of senses, charity and the like; they were 
promulgated by persons like the Buddha who had given up the 
path of the Veda and did acts contrary to the Veda and they 
were propounded to persons that were beyond the pale of the 
three Vedas and that mostly were sudras and persons outside 
the system of the four vamas and asramas. Medh&tithi on 
Manu IE. 6 adopts this and remarks 1695 that the Sakyas, Bhojakas 
and Ksapanakas do not admit the Veda as authoritative, they 
openly declare the Veda to be unauthoritative and they teach 
doctrines directly opposed to the Veda. TheCaturvirnsatimata 16 ' 6 
states that the words of Arhat (Jina), of Carvaka and of 
Bauddhas, should he abandoned as they lead to delusion. 

Then comes the question of the conflict between smrtis and 
puranas. It has been shown in the H. of Dh., vol. 1 pp. 160-167, 
how the Puranas are rich in Dharmasastra material. The sutras 
and early smrtis do not look upon the Puranas as a source of 
dharma, though Gaut. XI. 19 and Yaj. [. 3 mention Purana as 
one of the classes of works on which the king or any one else 
may draw for knowledge of dharma and though the Ap. Dh. S. 
quotes from a Purana in I. 6. 19. 13, 1. 10 29. 8 and II. 9. 23 3 
and names a Bhavisyatpurana in II. 9. 24 6. It is to he noted 
that the views quoted by Ap. from the Puranas in the first three 
passages are opposed to the views of the Kalivarjya section 
alleged to be taken from the Adityapurana in medieval digests. 
The passage of the Tantravartika stating that Puranas, 
Manusmrti and Itihasa are universally accepted throughout 
India has been already quoted (on p. 853). When Manu states 
that smrti is a source of dharma he does not obviously com- 
prehend Puranas under smrti as Manu IL 10 clearly shows 
(.dliarmaiaslram tu w» smrUh). Manu EL 232 and Yaj HL 189 
employ the plural 'Puranani' and so those smrtis obviously

hat one should strengthen the Veda by (the study ?)t 

knowledge i B insignificant 'this man willharmrne' Air- 
ing to the Bhagavata-purana I 4. 25 the purpose"'" of the 
composition of the Mahabharata was this that as the Veda 
cannot be leaint by women, sudras and hrahmanas who are so 
onlybybir,th(anddo not study) the sage VySsa took com. 
passion on them and composed the Mahabharata for their bene- 
fit. ^ The same must be deemed to be the purpose of the com- 
position of the puranas. The Daksasmrti n. 69 prescribes 1 " 9 
the recitation of itihasa and purana in the 6th and 7th parts of 
the day (divided into 8 parts). The Ausanaea smrti (HI. 
P. 515, Jivananda ) prescribes the study of the Veda in the 
bright half of the months from Magha after utsarjana and the 
study of the Vedangas and of Purana in the dark half. It 
appears that some at least of the extant PurSnas were composed 
in the first centuries of the Christian era and that from early 
times they contained dharmasastra material. In another section 
the pauranadkarma will be separately dealt with hereafter. 
Gradually the Puranas became very popular in the course of 
centuries, some of the original rites prescribed by the Veda and 
the early smrtis went out of vogue and new modes of worship 
and rites provided by the Puranas came into general obser- 
vance. The Vedavyasa smrti 1 ' 00 (I. 4) and the Sangraha state

preferred. Apararka (p. 9) quotes" 01 a smrtitext 'that is 
highest dharma which is understood from the Veda, that is to 
be known as inferior dharma that is declared m the Puranas 
and the like'. Apararka (p. 15) further tells us that™ accor- 
ding to the Bhavisyatpurana the puranas are of authority in 
declaring dharma that is uyamiira ( i. e. mixed up and not 
purely Vedic). Medieval wiiters were often divided as to the 
authoritativeness of puranas. Mitramisra ( in his commen- 
tary "<» onYaj. II. 21) asserts that dharmasastra (viz. smrti) 
is not more authoritative than purana and that in case of con- 
flict hetween a smrti text and a purana text recourse must he 
had to reasoning as in the case of conflict hetween two smrtis. 
On the other hand, the V. Mayukha, 1704 after quoting Manu IX 
126 and Devala ahout the first horn among twins being regarded 
as the oldest and after referring to a half verse from the 
Bhsgavatapurana ( rather from the commentary of Srfdhara 
thereon) which holds that among twins the one horn later is to 
he deemed as the elder, remarks that the Purana passage is to 
he set aside in favour of the smrti passages and that in the 
puranas usages opposed to the smrtis are very frequently met 
with. It further says that this view is preferable to that of 
some others according to whom in this matter the custom of 
the country should be followed. The Nirnayasindhu (BL 
p. 251 ) also says the same. The respect for the puranas carried 
away late medieval writers so far that relying on some pro- 
phetic passages in the puranas about the disappearance of 
four vamas in the Kali age and the subsistence of only brah- 
manas and sudras therein, they denied the existence of ksatriyas 
and vaisyas in the Kali age, in spite of the fact that all smrtis 
(like Manu, Yaj , ParasaTa) and many commentaries (including 
the Mitaksara) hold that the four varnas exist in the Kali age

Vide H. of Dh. vol. H pp. 380-382 about the existence ofksa. 
triyas in the Kali age. 

The case of conflict between smrfci and customs has now 
to be consideied. The general rule deduced from Vas, I. 5, 
Yaj, I. 7 and supported by the Mit. ( on Yaj 1. 7 and IL 117), 
the Sm. C. ( IL p. 266 ), Kulluka ( on Manu. n 10 ) and several 
others is that smtri is of superior authority to the usages of 
the sistas. But from early times there hare been dissenting 
voices. Visvarupa on Yaj. HL 250 states that that purport of -the 
smrtis is to be followed which is in accordance with the settled 
practice of the sistas resident in iLryavarta 1705 . On Manu IV. 
176 Medhatithi points out that niyoga is permitted by such 
smrtis" 06 as Gaut. 18.4-14, Yaj. I 68-69, Vas 17. 56-65, but 
being condemned by the people it is not practised. There- 
fore the principle that may be deduced from these is that 
the prescriptions of smrtis (and even of sruti) need not be 
observed and should not be observed when they are vehemently 
condemned by the people. The chapter on Kalivarjya will make 
this clear. Commentators like Medhatithi ( on Manu II. 10 ) went 
bo far as to say that Dharma&astra is that which prescribes what 
is to be done for attaining dharma, that is smrti from which 
dharma which one performs as a duty is understood and there- 
fore sistacara 1707 also is smrti. The smrtis themselves embodied 
the practices of the people current in their days, as Manu 1 107 
declares, ' in this work dharma has been fully stated as well as 
the good and evil qualities of ( human ) actions and the ancient 
customs and usages of the four varnas.' im Manu adds (1. 108), 
' acara ( customs and usageB ) are transcendental law, and so 
are the practices declared in the Veda and t the smrti; therefore 
a twice-born person desirous of his own welfare should always

make efforts to follow it '. 1709 This has been the basic text in 
modern decisions that recognize the binding nature of customs. 
It is therefore necessary to understand the exact meaning of 
this verse. Two constructions are possible ; ( 1 ) that the word 
acara is qualified by the words ' srutyukta ' and ' smarta ' and 
thai the first half declares that usages declared in the Yeda or 
,smrti are transcendental law ( this is the meaning given by 
most commentators of Mann ) ; (2) that acara by itself and 
other rules of conduct declared in the sruti or smrti are transcen- 
dental ( i. e. here in the first half of the verse there is a reference 
to three kinds of acaras, as Govindaraja and Nandana explain ). 
If we look to the preceding verse and the following verses ( that 
eulogise acara ) the 2nd construction looks more natural and has 
been accepted by the decided cases when 1710 they lay down that 
' immemorial usage is transcendental law ' ( Sir William Jones* 
translation of Manu L 108) and that "undeT the Hindu system of 
law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the 
law". The Anusasana (141. 65) and Santi 354. 6 expressly 
state that dharma is threefold viz. that declared in the Veda, 
that declared in the Bmrtis and the third is what is practised 
by sistas. Sumantu 1 ' 11 emphatically declares that family 
usage should be preferred to the prescriptions of sastra. The 
Kurmapurana 171z ( Uttarardha 15. 19 ) appears to support the 
2nd interpretation when it Bays, ' one should observe that acara 
which is declared by the aruti and smrti and which is rightly 
followed by the good '. The exact import of the word acara ( or 
sadacara) has been shifting from age to age and among com- 
mentators. In the earliest days, as shown by the Tai Up 
Gaut.(28.48,51), Baud Dh.S.1.1. 4-9, Manu XH. IO8-IO9'

The requisites of valid customs, according to the smrfcis and 
commentaries and digests, are similar to those laid down by the 
writers on PfirvamlmamsS i. e. they must be ancient, must not 
oo opposed to sruti and smrti, must be such that they are regard- 
ed by respectable people as obligatory on them and such as are 
observed with that consciousness by the sistas, they must be 
strictly construed and cannot be availed of by others not within 
their purview and must not be immoral or severely condemned 
by popular sentiment Customs once in vogue may be abandon- 
ed by the people as the chapter on Kalivarjya will show. 

From Gaut., Manu, Br., Eat and other writers quoted 
above it follows that the customs and usages of which account 
has to be taken are those of districts ( desa or janapada), towns 
and villages, castes, families, guilds or corporations or groups 
( gana, sreni, sangha, naigama, varga ). A few words on each of 
these and on usages of gotras and iakhas will be said later on 
and a few illustrations of each will be given. But first of all 
certain preliminary observations have to be made about customs 
in general. The medieval writers on Dharmasastra make it clear 
that customs that depart from the generally received smrti 
prescriptions must be strictly construed and that they cannot be 
extended on the ground of analogy to other matters outside the 
specific acknowledged customs For example, both the Sm (I- 
71 ) and the Smrtimuktfiphala 1713 (on Varnasrama p 31) say that, 
though one's maternal uncle's daughter can be married (by 
custom ) yet one's mother's sister or mother's sister's daughter

cannot be mawied, because popular sentiment is opposed to the 
latter kind of marriages and popular sentiment has to be 
respected as Manu declares (in IV. 176}. Similarly the Samskara- 
kaustubha" 1 * and the Dharmasindhu provide that where there 
is a local or family UBage for narrowing down the limits of 
sapinda relationship in marriage, only those who belong to tnat 
locality or family can avail themselves of such narrowing down, 
but if a person in a different locality or belonging to a different 
family were to follow the practice of narrowing down the 
sapinda relationship, he would incur blame. Owing to the 
vastness of Bharatavar9a it was recognised that what was 
sadacara in one country would not be so in another, as is noted 
by the Par. M. ( I. 2. p. 65 ) in relation to marriage with one's 
maternal uncle's daughter. 1715 

A few words may now be said about customs of countries. 

That usages about details of ritual varied a great deal even in 

the Vedic times is quite clear. The Sat Br. (LI. 4 13) notes 

that -in former times it was the wife of the sacrificer that rose 

at the Haviskrt call, but that in its own day the wife or a 

priest (the Agnldhra) rises in answer to the call. Vide H. of 

Dh. vol. 1L p. 1027 and n. 2311 on the Haviskrt call. For 

similar differences in practices vide the same Brahmana 2CJL1. 3. 

5. 1 and XLl. 6 1. 41. The Ait. Br. frequently refers to one view 

and refutes it by saying that one should not do so ( tat tatha 

na kuryat ) or one should discard it ( tat tat riadrlyam ) e. g. vide 

chap. 13 7, 17. 1, 18. 8, 28 1, 29. 5. ' Vide also Tai. Br. L 1. 8,

878 History of Dliarmabaslra [ Vol, 

noted above (pp. 856-857) Baudhayana made a distinction about 
the customs of the northern and southern people ( countries ). 
That customs of the northern and southern countries differed 
is emphasized by many commentators and writers of digests. 
For example, the Mit. on Yaj. I 256 refers to the differing views 
of daksinatyas and udlcyas on Ekoddista-siraddha. Sankara- 
bhatta in the introductory verses of the Dvaitanirbaya (or 
Dharma-dvaita-) expressly states that he will furnish solutions 
of knotty points in DharmasSstra after abiding by the views of 
southern writers. 1716 The Nirnayasindhu in its section on sapindya 
speaks of Sulapani, Vacaspati and Suddhiviveka asGaudas 
and Maithilas, and points out that Sulapani in the Sambandha- 
viveka and the Sambandhatattva (a Gauda work) allow 
marriage with a girl separated by three gotras from the bride- 
groom, while the southern writers ( daksinstyas ) do not accept 
the view. But in those days there were no rigid territorial 
boundaries for certain practices or doctrines. For example, 
VijnSnesvara, Madana-ratna, Farijata, Vacaspati and Sfllapani 
accepted the view that sapindya arises from community of the 
particles of the body, while AparSrka, Smrtioandnka and 
Madhava ( though they were southern writers like Vijnanesvara) 
held that sapindya was based on the offering of pmda in 
sraddhas. The fashion of dividing Hindu works into schools 
and assigning them definite territorial limits started witn 
Colebrooke and has been perpetuated by decisions of the s Privy 
Council and of the Indian High courts Vide Collector of Madura

were interpreted to mean that the words ' what is acquired at the 
cost of paternal estate by a person himself stand by themselves 
and do not qualify the other clauses, then what is acquir- 
ed through friendship even at the cost of the paternal estate 
would not be liable to partition, which would be opposed to the 
practice among people. The Vyavahara-mayukha also 1718 says 
on Manu IX. 210 ( about reunion } that the law and administra- 
tion of justice are generally based as is the case with grammar 
on people's usages. The Vlramitrodaya also states that all 
writers of digests are agreed that smrtis on Vyavahara generally 
re-iterate recognized popular usages. 

Customs of countries and families have been specially 
recognized from very anoient times in the sphere of marriage. 
The Ssv. gr. (1 7. 1-2 ) has been already cited above ( p. 856 ). 
The commentators on Asv. gr., HaTadatta and Narayana, both 
mention that in certain countries sexual intercourse is com- 
menced immediately af teT marriage, that this practice is oppos- 
ed to the rule in S.sv. gr. 1 1. 10 that the married couple should 
be celibate after marriage for at least three nights ( if not for a 
longer period ) and that one should follow the rule laid down 
in the grhyasutra and not the usage of the country. The £p. 
gr. (n. 15 ) remarks, 1719 ' people should understand from women 
( and others ) what procedure is ( to be followed according to 
the oustom of the country )' and the commentator Sudarsana- 
carya notes that certain rites like the worship of planets, 
aftkararopana and the tying of prattsara ( a string or ribbon tied 
round the wrist) are usual and are performed with Vedic 
Mantras The Kathakagrhya (25. 7 ) allows the usages of 
countries and families to be observed in marriage and the

The com. BrShmanabala states that in Kashmir at the MmT of 
marriage the mother-in-law or some other woman whose husband 
M alive ties an auspicious wreath on the heads of the bride and 
the bridegroom, that the mother-in-law places flowers on 
the feet, knees, shoulders and head of the bridegroom and on 
the same seven plaoesof the bride's body flowers are placed 
but in the reverse order (i.e. first on the left limb and then 
on the right). 

Haradatta on Gaut. 21. 20 (cited above in n 1663) mentions 
the following usages : in the Cola country while the snn U in 
the zodiacal sign of Aries maidens draw with powders of 
•various colours on the ground an orb of the sun together with 
attendants and offer worship in the morning and evening; on 
the full moon day of Msrgaslrsa maidens putting on ornaments 
walk about in the village and offer to a temple idol whatever 
they get in their wanderings ; when the sun is in the sign of 
the Crab, maidens worship the goddess UmS while the moon is 
in the constellation of the FurvS Phalgunls and offer to the gods 
mudga beans that have put forth sprouts and salt ; when the 
snn is in the sign of Pisces, house-holders worship the Goddess 
of wealth while the moon is in the constellation of TJttara 
Phalgunl. £.p. Dh. S. H. 6. 13. 7 notes that in certain countries 
the special portions of the eldest son in paternal wealth ate 
gold, dark-coloured oattle and black-coloured produce of the 
eoil(i. e. black grain). Vide Br. and Tantravartika quoted 
above ( as to customs of certain countries). 

Several such illustrations may be furnished from other 
writers, but considerations of Bpace make it necessary to omit 
reference to them. 

The Par. gr. S. I. 8 states 17 * that the usages of villages 
may be followed, since a text says 'one should enter a village 
( i. e. follow the opinion of village elders ) in case of marriage 
and funeral rites ' and Bince the Veda says that the village is 
the authority in these two. *

jjji Caste customs 8S1 

Numerous caste customs have teen recognized from ancient 
times to these days. Gaut. XL '20, Vas L 17, Manul.118, 
VUL 41 and 46, Kaut. IE. 7, Sukra IV. 5. 47 emphasize the 
validity of caste customs and call upon the king to enforce 
them. Yaj.L-361 advises the king to punish those who swerve 
from the usages of their family, caste, guild, or group. Katya- 
yana (40) enjoins" 21 that the king should not disregard the 
fixed usages even of praltloma castes and of the inhabitants of 
inaccessible placeB (mountain forts or habitations), even if 
they be opposed (to the rules of smrtis). In the Paribhasa- 
prakasa Mitramisia holds 1722 that the usages of good sudras 
free from moral defects are binding on their sons and others 
even though they do not know the Veda. 

Compared to Western Christian countries very great 
religious tolerance prevailed in ancient India Vide H. of Dh. 
vol. IL pp 388 (n. 928 a), 7X3-724 for some remarks on this. 
Asoka in his Pillar Edict Vll \ E I. vol. If. p. 272 ) says that he 
looked after sanghas, brahmanas, Sjlvakas and all other sects 
( pasanda ). The Bhagavadgita ( IX. 23-25 ) proclaims that the 
devotees that worship other gods do worship Krsna himself 
though in an irregular way and that those who offer worship to 
the Manes or to the elements reach the goals they desire. The 
M&nasollasa enjoins 1723 that one should give up condemnation 
of or hafaed towards other gods, that one should show reverence 
on seeing an image or a temple and Bhould not pass it over ( in 
contempt). People of different countries no doubt twitted each 
other on the customs and usages peculiar to each; but it rarely 
went beyond the bandying of words. For example, even such a

philosophical work as the Jlvanmuktiviveka remarks 1 "* that 
brahmanas of the south condemn even the learned brahmanas 
of the north as flesheaters and brahmanas of the north condemn 
southern brahmanas because they marry their maternal uncle's 
daughters and because they carry earthen vessels in fairs or on 
pilgrimages. It was on account of the general attitude of 
religious tolerance that the Bmrtis and digests prescribe that 
even the usages of heretical sects should be enforced by the 
king. Yaj. II. 192 prescribes l72S that the king should guard 
against breach of the distinctive usages and conventions of 
guilds ( of artisans ), of traders, of heretical sects and bands ( of 
soldiers ). Narada ( samayasyanapakarma 1-3 ) states 1726 that 
the king should uphold the conventions of heretical sects, of 
traders, guilds and other groups and that whatever traditional 
usages, activities, mode of attendance and means of maintenance 
were peculiar to them should be permitted to them by the king 
without introducing any change. Among the matters of which 
the king was to take cognizance suo motu and included under 
praklrnaka by Narada (verse %) was the transgression of the usages 
of heretics, traders, guilds and ganas. Brhaspati provides 172 ' 
that in disputes among husbandmen, artisans, wrestlers, money- 
lenders, guilds, dancers, heretios, thieves, a decision is to be 
given in accordance with their conventions. It is no doubt true 
that certain smrtis present a sterner treatment of heretics and

the like Gaut. IX 17 provides 1728 that a snataka should not 
talk with mlecchas, impure persons and sinners. Manu IX. 225 
prescribes that the king should banish from his capital gamblers, 
dancers, heretics, vintners &c. Manu IV. 30 holds that one should 
not honour as guests even by words ^persons who are heretics, 
rogues &c. and recommends that one 'should not reside in a 
country which is overrun by groups of heretics. Yaj II. 70 and 
N5r. (rnadana 180 ) say that a heretic ( pakhandi } or an atheist 
iB not a proper witness These passages may be explained in 
various ways. Probably the prescriptions of Gautama and 
Manu refer to an age when the schism caused by Buddhists and 
Jainas was not very old and feelings between the followers of 
the Veda a'nd the heretics ran high. But most of these prescrip- 
tions are addressed to the followers of the Veda as individuals. 
They do not negative the requirements laid down by Nar., Br. 
and others that the king ( though of a different persuasion ) was 
to enforce among heretics their own usages. It can be said 
without any fear of contradiction that at least from the 4th 
century A. D. onwards the policy of the State in India was ' to 
protect all religions, but to interfere with none '. M2 » 

Customs of families will be briefly referred to later on in 
connection with modern law cases Among family customs the 
customs about the year when caula was performed and the locka 
of hair kept on the bead in the caula ceremony are frequently 
mentioned in the grhya sutras and other works Vide H of Bh 
vol. II pp. 260 and 265 ^ , 

The digests contain numerous examples about the customs 
and usages that were adhered to among the followers of the 
several Vedic branches (saktes) and the grhya sutras in perform- 
ing several religious rites A few examples may be set out hew 
by way of illustration. According to YzHUZ the offering 
of pinias to the prfrs in a sraddha takes place after the bmhmanas 
invited at the sraddha are fed, while Manu m. 2 6 1 siowlrt

one should follow one's sakbl. The same remark applies to the 
number of handfuls of water offered in tarpana ( Sm. C. I p. 191 
and MadanapSrijata p. 286 ). About the month of pregnancy in 
which the ceremony of slmantonnayana was to be performed 
each person was to follow his own grhyasfifcra ( Sm. L p. 17, 
and Par. M. L part 2 p. 22 ). The same holds good as to the day 
of namakarana ( Sm. 0. 1 p. 21, Par. M. I. part 2 p 25 ). It is 
not necessary to multiply examples. According to Gaut. XI. 
21-W and others already cited above, the king has to enforce 
tho usages of guildB < sreni ) and corporations. Several such 
usagos havo been oited above ( pp. 487-488 ) 



CHAPTER XXXIV 
KALIVARJYA 

( ACTIONS FORBIDDEN IN THE KALI AGE. ) 

It has been stated above (pp. 865-866) that one of the 

several ways in which the conflict between several smrti toKtB 

was got over was to hold some of them as legislating for a 

bygone age ( yugantara ). For example, when Harlta allowed 

upanayana to women, both the Sra. C. ( 1 24 ) and Par. M. (12. 

p. 83 ) hold that the text refers to another fcdpa ( aeon ). In H 

of Dh. vol. 1L (on pp. 151, 162,424,451,603,612,620,750, 790, 796, 

938, 929, 934, 953, 1005 n, 1201 n) reference has been made to 

several matters forbidden in the Kali age. It is remarkable in 

this connection to note that, though the Parasarasmrti ( in 1. 24 ) 

claims par excellence to lay down the dharmas for the Kali age, 

several important provisions contained in it, viz. the remarriage 

of a married woman 1730 (Parasara IV. 30), the variation in 

the period of impuv'.ty due to births and deaths depending on 

the learning and character of a brahmana ( Parasara HI. 5-6 ), 

permission for a brahmana to partake of the food of five classes 

among sudras (33. 21 ) are included among Kalivarjyas by the 

Adityapurana (as quoted by writers of the 12th and later 

centuries ). It is necessary, therefore, to investigate into the 

origin and development Of the Yuga theory and of the topic of 

Kalivarjya. 

From the Mahabharata ( Santi 59 ), Manu ( L 81 ), Narada 
(L 1-2), Brhaspati and the Puranas it is clear that they all 
believed in the existence of an ideally perfect community in 
the dim past followed by gradual degeneracy and decline in 
morals, health and length of life. But they also believed that 
a cycle of decline would be followed in the far distant future 

1730 Some of the printed editions of Parasara ( IV. 30 ) read sift ^ ... 
TRtt^ri^nt But the Par. M. on it (vol.11 part 1 p 53 ) makes it 
clear that this reading was fabricated by orthodox people and that Midhava 
at leasi read it as q fauJ i iWttit, M ho remarks 'art s* S -i Tg l ft

by another of moral perfection. The only pity is that all works 
that are extant think that they are in the midst of a very 
sinful age and there is not a single work which thinks that the 
era of perfection may dawn in the very near future 

Tlrc germ of the theory of progressive deterioration in 
morals is found even in the Rgveda. In the famous dialogue 
of Yama and YamI the former exclaims in one place 1731 (Rg 
X 10. 10) ' those later ages are yet to come when sisters would 
do what is not sister-like '. The word ' yuga ' occurs at least 
33 times in the Rg., hut the exact meaning is somewhat doubt- 
ful. In a few, places it means 'yoke ' ( Rg X 60 8, X 101. 3 
and 4). In several places it appears to stand for a very brief 
period of time ( e. g. Rg. m. 26. 3 ) Generally it means * a 
generation ' (as in Rg. I 92 11, 1. 103. 4, I 124 2, II 2 2, 
ILL 33 8, V. 52 4 ) In Rg. I 158. 6, * dlrghatama mamateyo 
jujurvan dasame yuge ' i/iir/a probably means ' a period of four 
or five years ', while in Rg. VI 15. 8, VI. 8 5, X 72 %, X. 94 
12, X 97. 1 it should mean 1732 ' a long period of time ' ■ In the 
Atharvaveda VIII. 2, 21 yuga appears to mean a period of 
several thousand years, two yugas being indicated as longer 
than 10000 years ( iatam tesyuiam teyanan di& yuge hint catvaii 
krnmah ). Here there is a clear reference to four yugas and to 
the fact that yuga meant a very long period of time. What- 
ever he the meaning of the word in each passage, the Rgveda 
does not contain the names of all the four well-known yugas 
viz. Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali. The word ' Krta ' when 
used in the Rgveda appears to mean ' the best throw of dice 
or of the seeds of vibhltaka in gambling * ( X. 34. 6, X 43 5 ). 
In the Atharvaveda VH. 52. 2, 5, 6 k rta h as the same meaning 
Kali is the name of the author of Rg. VHI. 66 and in verse 15

of that hymn we read ' kalayo ma bibhltana ' ( O descendants 
of Kali I do not be afraid ). In B,g. X. 39. 8 the Asvins axe 
said to have rejuvenated Kali who had become old. Vide also 
Rg. L 112. 15 ( where Kali is said to have got a wife from 
Asvins ). But Kali as a throw of dice doeB not occur in the 
Rgveda In the Atharvaveda VII 114 1 Kali 1733 means a 
throw of dice. The words krla, treta, dvapara and ashrnda 
occur in the Tai S. IV. 3. 3, Vaj S. 30. 18 173i and in the Sat. Br. 
XBX 6. 2. 9-10 (S.B. E. vol. 44 p. 416). In later literature 
Kali is also called Tisya ( as in Bhtsmaparva 10. 3 ). In the 
Tai Br. EL 4. 16 the word Kali is used 1735 in place of Askanda. 
In all the above places Krta and the other three words denote 
throws in gambling, Krta being the most lucky and Kali being 
the most unlucky. In another passage of the Tai 1736 Br. (1. 5. 11} 
we read ' the four stomas (Trivrt, Fancadasa, Saptadasa and 
Ekavimsa) are Krta and the five are Kali; therefore the 
calustoma (should be performed in the Jyotistoma ) *. This 
shows that Krta meant a throw of four or any multiple of four 
and Kali a throw which when divided by four left one aB 
remainder. The Aitareya Br. employs the words Krta 1737 and 
the other three in a metaphorical sense as representing progres- 
sively more desirable states of human activity, ' one lying down 
becomes Kali, when about to leave the bed he becomes Dvapara, 
when rising he becomes Treta, and when he moves about he

becomes Krta *. The Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 6 speaks of Kali 1 ' 38 as 
* abhibliu ' ( the vanquisher ) and suggests that Kali is a throw 
of five that vanquishes all others. In the Chan. TJp. IV. 1. 4 it 
•is said 'aB (in a game 1739 of dice) all the lower throws are 
included in the Krta throw which becomes victorious, so to him 
( to Baikva ) comes ( the merit of ) all the good acts that people 
do '. Here Sankara explains that Krta is a tbrow of dice having 
four marks, while other throws that have three, two or one 
mark are called Treta, Dvapara and Kali respectively. The 
Mundaka Up. I 2. 1 refers to Treta 1 " . 'This is the truth; the 
sacrificial rites which the sages saw in the mantras (i, e. as 
prescribed in the hymns of the Bgveda and other vedas) have 
been performed in many ways in the Treta \ This last word is 
explained by SankarScarya in two ways, first as referring to 
the threefold priestly duties ( of hotr, adhvaryu and udgatr ) 
which are based on the three Vedas and alternatively as refer- 
ring to the Treta age. Irom this resume it appears that even 
up to the times of the latest period of Vedie literature (i.e. 
Upanisads ) the words Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali were used 
in the sense of throws of dice in gambling and that it is very 
doubtful whether they were used in the sense of different ages 
of the world. Even in the Mahabharata Krta" 41 and ^apara 
are used also in the sense of throws of dice (vide Virata 50. 34 J. 
IntheGopatha Brahmana (I 28) there is a reference to the 
beginning of the Dvapara age. 

Eveninthe Vedanga Jyotisa"«(of BgJ the word yuga is used 
in the sense of a period of five years ( pancasaravatsaramayam

yugadhyaksam praj&patim). The ancient Pitamahasiddhanta 
which iB not now extant, stated, according to the Pancasid- 
dhantika of Yaiaaamlhiia (XIL 1), that j/uga means five years 
of the Sun and the Moon ( ravisasinoh panca yugam varsani 
Pitamahopadistani ). This Bense of the word is still found in 
the Sahhaparva 11. 38. 

The Nirukta (L 20) distinguishes between ancient sages and 
those of later days in the words, 17 * 3 ' the (ancient) sages had an 
intuitive perception of dharma and they imparted the Vedic 
mantras by instruction to later ( sages ) who had no intuitive 
perception of dharma*. But it does not mention or refer to any 
theory of four yugas. Both Gaut. L 3-4 and Ap. Dh. S. H. 6. 13. 
7-9 give expression to the view that among sages of old 
transgressions of dharma and violent actions are observed, but 
that on account of their distinguished spiritual greatness they 
incurred no sin, while a person of later days, being weak in 
spiritual merit, should not imitate them, otherwise he would 
come to grief. Here a distinction is drawn between very 
ancient sages and later sages as regards the endowment of 
spiritual merit, but nothing is said about the names or the 
theory of the four yugas. Ap. Dh. S. 1. 2. 5. 4 further says 1 ' 41 
that sages are not born among men of later days {avaresu) on 
account of the transgressions of religious ordinances <( prevalent 
in later ages ). Therefore, it would not be quite wrong to assume ' 
that the theory had not been fully developed even in the times of 
the early dharmasutras of Gaut and Ap. even though both 
held that they were living in an age of decline and that sages 
coming aftei the authors of the mavhas were inferior. 

Here epigraphic evidence affords some help in fixing the 
lower limit of the period when the theory of yugas must have 
been developed. 

In the Rock Edicts of Asoka No. 4 and No 5 we have at 
Kalsi and two other places the wordB 'ava kapam' (yavat 
kaIpam)andatGirnar the words 'ava samvata kapa' which 
mean up to the end of the kalpa' or * up to the end of the 
kalpa when the clouds or fires of destruction called samvarta

Kadamba king Kakusthavarman refers to Kaliyuga < E. I. vol. 
VIUp. 34) It is not necessary to adduce passages from ins- 
criptions of a later date, From the above it may be said that 
the theory of yugas and kalpas had begun to take shape at 
least in the 4th or 3rd century B. C. and that in the first cen- 
turies of the Christian era it had been fully developed. It must 
have gone through several stages in the course of its develop- 
ment. For example, Brahmagupta (Brahmasphuta-siddhanta 
XL 10 ) states that the theory of yugas, Manus and kalpas Bet 
out by Sxyabhata was not like that of the smrtis. 

The same conclusion is arrived at from a consideration 
of the classical Sanskrit literature. The theory of yugas and 
manvantaras as detailed in the MahsbhSrata ( Vanaparva chap- 
ters 149, 188, Santi chapters 69, 231-232), Manu chap. I, Visnu- 
dharma-sutra XX. 1-21, the Puranas ( such as Visnu I. 3, VL 3, 
Markandey a 46, Brahma 229-230, Matsya 142-144) and astro-

called sandhya (that precedes each yuga) and the period call- 
ed sandfojamta (that follows each yuga) 12000 years, i e. Krta, 
Treta, Dvapara and, Kali extend respectively over 4000, 3000, 
2000, 1000 years and sandhya and sandhyamsa of these font 
extend over 400, 300, 200 and 100 years each (i. e the sandhya. 
of Krta is 400 years and the sandhyamsa of Krta is 400 years 
and so on ), But these are divine years. Each divine year is 
equal to 360 human years. Therefore we have to multiply 12000 
by 360 to arrive at the number of human years in the four 
yugas ( i. e. the figure is 4320000 ). The Krtayuga -with its 
sandhya and sandhyamsa comes to 1728000 human years, 
Treta to 1296000, Dvapara to 864000 and Kali to 432000 These 
four yugas are together called sometimes caturyuga (Manu 
I 71 ) or simply yuga also ( Yanaparva 188. 27, Santi 232. 29 ) ; 
1000 of these four yugas constitute a day of Brahma, which is 
called Kalpa. The night of Brahma is of the same duration. At 
the end of a kalpa the universe is resolved into Brahma ( and this 
is called p> alaya ) and at the end of Brahma's night the world is 
created again In one day of Brahma there are 14 Manus and 
therefore each Manvantara is equal to about 71 caturyugae{1000 
divided by 14 ) The life of Brahma is 100, out of which half is 
gone and therefore the present is said to be the 2nd or latter half 
(dwtiya paiaidha) of the life of Brahma and at present the 
kalpa that is running is called Y&raha From the above it 
will be seen that, according to the Puranas, the universe has 
been created and dissolved many times and there have been 
numerous Manvantaras also (vide Manu 1 80) The four 
yugas in various ways differ in their characteristics. Krta is 
so called because it is an age in which everything is fulfilled 
by every one and nothing is left to be done "« The symbolic 
colours of the four yugas are respectively white, yellow, red 
and dark ( Yanaparva 189. 32 ) In Krta, Dharma prevails in 
all its perfection and it stands with all its four feet ( dhanna 
being figuratively spoken of as vrsa, i7S0 a bull, in Manu YTTT, 
16 and Yanaparva 190. 9 ) and it declines or deteriorates by a 
quarter in each of the following yugas (Manu L 81-82 
= Santi 232. 23-24 ), so that in Kali only one quarter ( or one 
foot ) of dharma remains and adharma occupies three quarters. 
In Krta people aTe entirely free from diseases, secure all that

they desire and the length of human life is four hundred years. 
all of which decline by one qnarier successively in the follow- 
ing three yugas ( Manu L 83=S5nti 232 25 ). The dharmas in 
each of the four yugas are different ; tapas was the highest in 
Krta, philosophic knowledge in Txeta, sacrifice in Dvapara and 
charity alone in Kali ( Mann L 85-86=Parasara L 22-23 
=Santi 232. 27-28 ). Manu L 85, SSnti 232 27 and 261. 8, 
Parasara L 22 all hare the same verse stating that the dharmas 
prescribed for men in each yuga differ. 

In Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali the dharmas ( tbat should 
be observed) are respectively declared by Manu, Gautama, 
Sankha-Likhita and Parasara ( Parasara I 24 ) In Krta there 
was a single varna but at the end of Kali almost all will 
be sudras (Brahma 229. 52, Matsya 144.78) Parasara (I 
25-28 ) points out other characteristics of the four yugas, which 
need not be detailed here. Manu IX.301 and S02, however, 
indicate that the yugas are not watertight parts of Time. lb 
is the king who can by his conduct introduce the characteristics 
of one yuga into another. Medhatithi on Manu IX. 301 explains 
that the king should not be misled into thinking that Kali is a 
historical part of Time and tbat he ( the king ) cannot therefore 
be Kali or Krta, but that it is the king's way of conducting 
himself that" will produce the conditions of the several yugas 
among bis people.

The dates of the composition of the Puranas not being 
beyond controversy, it would be difficult to point to a particular 
period as the time when the full-fledged theory of the yugas 
was developed. But this much can be stated with certainty 
that by the 4th century A. D. at the latest the theory had been 
completely developed. Sjyabhata 1755 ( in KalakriySpSda 10 ) 
Btates that when three padas of the yuga ( i. e. Krta, Treta and 
Dvapara ) and 3600 years more had elapsed, he was 23 years 
old i e { accepting the calculations current at present ) 
in 499 A. D. Aiyabhata was SS3 years old and so was born 
in 476 A. D In his Paficasiddhantika VarShamihira 1756 (505 
to 587 A. D ) summarises the data of several astronomical 

1754. It would be interesting to compare the descriptions of Kali 
given in the Mahabharata and the several Puranas. Some verses are com- 
mon to several of them and the ideas are almost the same throughont. 
The principal counts in the indictment are that there will be sudra and 
Mleccha lings, that heretical sects will predominate, that the ordered 
duties and pmileges of the several castes will be turned topsyturvy and 
there will be great physical and moral decline. After Vanaparva chap. 188 
there is an additional description in chap 190 of what will happen in the Kali 
age, which appears, from the express words of Vanaparva 191. 16, to have 
been taken from the Vayupnrana. So this chapter is a later interpolation 
The verse ar^jjir £.c. occurs again in Vanaparva 190 52 and also in 
Harivamsa(Bhavisyaparva 3. 12), Brahmapurana 230. 11, Matsya 47 258-

The first says that sudras with white teeth and (professing to have) 
curbed their senses, with the head shaved and wearing ochre-coloured robes 
and maintaining themselves on false doctrines will propound dharma. 
This is a direct attack on Bnddhist monks taken from the class of sudras.

Siddhantas of which Bomaka is one, about which Brabmagupta 
remarks that the Bomaka siddhanta is outside the pale of 
smrtis because 17SJ it omits all mention of yugas, manvantaras 
and kalpas that have been regarded by the smrtis as useful in 
measuring time. Kslid£sa 17S8 in Baghuvamsa 15. 96 speaks 
of dharma as having only three feet ( in Treta ) when Rama 
made up his mind to depart from this world. No scholar will 
assign to Kalidasa a date later than the middle of the 5th 
century A. D. Therefore the theory of yugas must be deemed 
to have been perfected long before 400 A. D. K. P. Jayaswal 
holds that the Yugapurana chapter of the Garga-samhita was 
composed about 50 B. O. ( J. B. O. E. S. vol. 14 p. 399 ) and he 
is probably right. 

At present it is the practice to hold Kali 5046 ( expired ) as 
equal to 1945 A. D, or salce 1867 or satitvat 2001-2. But it appears 
that there were several views about the date of the beginning 
of the Kaliyuga. The exact starting point on the above computa- 
tion was Briday, 18th February 3102 B. C. One view was that 
Kaliyuga was about to begin when the great Mahabharata war 
was fought out. 1759 This view is expressed in the Aihole 
Inscription which appears to equate the beginning of Kali with 
the Bharata war and states that 3735years ( expired ) from the 
Bharata war are equal to 556 years of the saka era." 60 Arya- 
bbata knew this computation, since he says that he , wm 
23 years old when three parts of the ( great) yuga and 3600 ibaa 
elapsed ( Kala-kriySpada, verse 10 ). Another view set forth m 
the Puxanas is that Kaliyuga began when Krsna finished m 
ava mra and went to heaven. »« This would putth^gnmng

appears that 13 3 is his own verse. Garga held the opinion that the Great 
Bear remained in one constellation for one hundred years That is all 
TJtpala quotes the %erse of Garga, but it is tn the Auustubh metre It was 
believed by the authors of the Puranas and even by such astronomers as 
Varahamibira that the constellation of the Great Bear remained in each 
rutksatra for a hundred years. Vide Br. Sam. 13 4, Bhagavata XII 2

been made by several scholars to meet this discrepancy by 
explaining tbe word ' sad-dvika-panoa-dviyutah ' ( in the Brhat- 
samhita) in various fanciful ways, whioh are far from 
satisfactory. There is no reason why dvtka should not 
straightforwardly be taken in the sense of 'two*, 176 * as the 
Lllavati and Br. Sam. 71. 5 itself do. 

It is difficult to believe that the Sakaksla referred to in 
that verse is different from the Sakendrakala or Sakbhupakala, 
which the PaficasiddhantikS (J 8) and the Brhat-samhita (8. 
20-21 ) make use of in several places At least Varahamihira 
gives no such indication. Mr. 0. V. Vaidya in his 'Maha- 
bharata, a critioism' pp. 80-81 holds that the Sakaksla referred 
to in the verse 'asan maghasu &c.' is the era of Buddha's 
Nirvana. There is hardly any warrant for this assumption. 
His interpretation of ' sad-dvika-panca-dviyutah ' as meaning 
2566 (and not 2526) is not bad and does not seriously affect the 
argument about the date of Yudhisthira. On that interpretation 
Yudhisthira would be placed in 2488 B. C. (instead of in 2448 
B. C). But there is no reason why the usual values of sat 
(BiXL),dmka(iwo) and other words should not be understood 
to be meant here. 

The data contained in the Nidhanpur plates of Bhaskara- 
varman (E. I vol. 331 p. 65), when properly scrutinized, appear 
to favour the position of Varahamihira. Those plates in sett- 
ing out the genealogy of Bhaskaravarman start with Naraka, 
whose son Bhagadatta fought on the side of the Kauravas m 
the Mahabharata war and was killed by Arjuna (videlfcoim- 
uarva chap 29 ) Bhagadatta's son is said to have been Vajra- 
datta. After Vajradatta his descendants ruled over Kamarupa 
for 3000 years and then Pusyavarman, a scion of tin .Bhaga- 
datta family became king of Kamarupa. King Bhaskara-

corresponds rather very closely with tlie statement of VarSha- 
mihira who puts Yudhisthira's reign at 653 Kaliyuga ( i. e. 
2448 B. a ). On the other hand, if we assume that the Maha- 
bharata war was fought in or that Kaliyuga started in 3101 
B. C.then Pusyavarman who flourished 3000 years after the 
Mahabharata war would have to be placed about 101 B. C. and 
there will be an interval of about 700 or 750 years between 
Pusyavarman and Bhaskaravarman. A period of 700 or 750 years 
for 12 rulers would work at about 60 years for each ruler, whiob 
is a very improbable average Therefore the Nidhanpur'plates do 
not support the hypothesis that the Mahabharata war was 
fought about 3101 B. C , but rather support the statement of 
VaTahamihrra that it was fought about 2500 B. O. 

Another epoch for the Mahabharata war and the beginning 
of Kaliyuga is indicated by some passages of historic impor- 
tance found in some of the Puranas The Vayupurana (99. 4-15) 
and the Matsyapurana ( 273. 36 ) say that from the birth of 
Parlksit to the coronation of Mahapadma (Nanda) a period 
of 1050 years elapsed, while the Bhagavata XH 2. 26 assigns 
1015 yearB for the same. There is some mistake in the Purana 
texts here. The Matsya ( in chap. 271. 17-30 ) enumerates the 
kings of the Barhadratha dynasty of Magadha descended from 
Sahadeva, son of Jarasandha, and Btates that the dynasty will 
rule (i. e ruled) for a thousand years. Then chap. 272 (verses 1-5) 
speaks of five kings, who will be followed by the Sisunska 
dynasty, that together reigned for 360 years and the last king 
in which was Mahanandi ( verses 6-13 ) whose son from a sudra 
wife was Mahapadma ( 272. 18 ). So if the years of these three 
dynasties are added we get the period of about 1500 yearB. This 
j'b supported by the Bhagavatapurana ( IX. 22. 48 and XII 1-2 ) 
and Vayupurana ( 99. 308-321), which latter says that 32 kings of 
the Barhadratha dynasty will rule for 1000, then five Vltihotra 
kings for 138 years (Pradyota and others) and then the 
Saisunaka ( Sisunaga in the Bhagavata and in the Brahmanda- 
purSna HI 74. 134-135) dynasty for 362 (in all exactly 
1500 years ). The same periods are given by the YisnupurSna 
I IV. 23 and 24 ) and by the Brahmandapurana 111 74. 121-135 
Srfdhara in his comment on Bhagavata XII. 2. 26 states that 
the interval between Parlksit and Nanda is 1498 as the 
Bhagavata holds that the Saisunaga dynasty ruled for 360 years 
„ w 7 '" Th6tef0Te tte P I0 P« fading in the Vayupurana

instead of ' pancasaduttaram ' or ' pancadasottaram. ' Taking 
the interval between Pariksit and Nanda to be 1500 years and 
holding as most modern scholars do that the Nandas flourished 
in the 4th century B. c, Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna, the 
Mahabharata war and the beginning of Kaliyuga would have 
to be placed in the 19th century B Thereforetherearesofarthree 
main different epochs for the Mahabharata war viz. 3101 B.o, 
2448 B. O. and about 1900 B. O. All the three are well attested 
by evidence dating at least from about the 5th century A. D. 
One cannot dogmatically say that a certain tradition alone out 
of these three is the only correct one. All that one can say is 
that one prefers a particular tradition to the other two. Since 
the epoch of 1900 B. O. is supported by the PurSnas in great 
detail by citing the names of the several kings and their regnal 
years I personally regard the epoch of 1900 B. 0. for the Maha- 
bharata war as more probable than the other two It is best to 
acknowledge one's inability to assign a certain date to the 
Mahabharata war rather than twist plain words or ignore al 
together inconvenient passages or put on them fanciful or fax- 
fetched interpretations. The first desideratum is to prepare 
critical editions of the important puranas from the bestmss 
material. Even then it is, doubtful whether unanimity among 
scholars can be secured. A scholarly beginning was^ made by 
Pargiter in his book ' The Purana texts of the dynasties of the 
Kali Age ' ( 1913 ). He compares the material available in tM 
printed editions of several PurEnas and Mss on the s ubject of 
royal dynasties. One cannot or may not agree with many of toe 
assumptions and inferences thathemakes or draws, yet one cannot

furnished by the Mahabharata and relying on the far-fetched 
and wrong interpretation put by him on the words of the Brhat- 
samhita ( quoted above ) and on the fact that the, Kollam era 
in Malabar appears to take 1177 B. as the starting point for 
Kaliyuga arrives at the conclusion that the Mahabharata war 
took place in the latter part of 1194 B. C. This theory goes 
against all the three other starting points which are supported 
by comparatively ancient and authoritative evidence. 

The information derived from the fragments of the work 
of Megasthenes on India are supposed to shed some light 
on this vexed problem xn one fragment ( p. 115 of ' Ancient 
India as described by Megasthenes &c. * ) occurs the passage : 
' From him { i. e. Bacchus ) to Alexander the Great 6451 years 
are reckoned with three months additional, the calculation 
being made by counting the kings that reigned in the inter- 
mediate period to the number of 153 *. An extract from Pliny 
makes out the number of kings to be 154. As against this we 
have the statement in the 'Iudika' of Arrian ( 2nd century 
A.D., translated by McCrindle, p. 203): 'iiom the time of 
DionysostoSandrakottus, the Indians counted 153 kings and 
a period of 6042 years, but among these a republic was thrice 

established another to 300 years and another to 120 years. 

The Indians also tell us that Dionysos was earlier than Heracles 
by fifteen generations and that except him no one made a 
hostile invasion of India'. This passage is of very great im- 
portance for one reason, viz that it proves that in the 4th 
century B O there was a persistent Indian tradition which 
carried back Indian civilization and ordered government to 
6000 years before the 4th century B. O But there is great 
doubt as to what Megasthenes actually wrote and there is some 
divergence as to the number of years and kings also. Besides, 
this has no direct bearing on the date of the Mahabharata war 
or the beginning of Kaliyuga, unless Heracles is taken to be 
Han-Ersna, as some scholars t76s do. The account of Heracles 
(PP 201-203 of McCrindle's work ) agrees in some respects with 
the legends about Krsna viz. that he was honoured by the 
Sour asenoKSSrasenas), an Indian tribe who po>sess two large

cities Methora (Mathura) and Cleisobora and that Heracles 
had many wires; but then there aie otbBr anecdotes about 
Heracles which do not at all agree viz his having a daughter 
Fandaia with whom when she was only 6even Heracles had 
intercourse for raising a mighty race. Here there iB some confus- 
ion with the Pandavas and KuntI or with the Fandyan kingdom 
in the South. Moreover, 6000 years for 153 or 154 kings is 
rather a very long period. It cannot be said that a king is only 
a unit of time in these computations ( 40 years on an average), 
since such PurSnas aB the Vayu and the Matsya expressly mention 
the number of years that each dynasty held sway, the number 
of kings belonging to each dynastly and the lengths of the 
reigns of several kings It is no doubt true that the detaita 
of the names of the several kings, the number of kings and the 
duration of their reigns do not always tally. It appears that 
the Puranas that contain historical material were recast at diffe- 
rent times, e. g. the Vayupursna( 99. 383) refers to the Guptas 
while the Matsyapurana is silent about them. The extant 
Furanas cannot be supposed to have given imaginary details 
about historical dynasties, but they must have had before them 
older records or traditions. The PurSnas do not appear to have 
invented names of new kings or givenhnaginarylengthsof reigns. 

The authors surely knew-that the total of the several dynasties 
between Parlksit and Nanda did not square with Jfre total of 
the lengths of the reigns of the several individual kings. But

view that the Mahabharata war was fought in 3101 B. Mr. N. 
Jagannatha Rao writes a book on ' the Age of the Mahabharata 
war* (Bezwada, 1931), in which he disputes the identity 
of Candragupta Maurya with Sandracottus mentioned by 
Megasthenes, holds that Sandracottus is the Gupta Emperor 
Candragupta, that the date of Candragupta Maurya would be 
about 1535 B C, that the word * Sakakala ' in the Brhatsamhita 
refers really to the era of the Persian Emperor Cyrus about 
550 B. o. and that the Great War was fought in 3139 B. O. The 
work doeB not go deeply into anything and is rather superficial. 
There is a lengthy and interesting article by Mr. K. G. Sankar 
on 'some problems of Indian Chronology' in Annals of the 
B. O. R. Institute, Poona, vol. XII pp. 301-361 in which he seems 
to favour 1198 B. G. as the date of the Mahabharata war. 
Mr. J. S. Karandikar, editor of the * Kesari * (Poona), contribut- 
ed certain articles ( in MaTathi ) which are now issued as a 
booklet (1939), in which he examines many of the astronomical 
references in the Mahabharata and the Pauranic lists about the 
dynasties of ancient Indian kings and arrives at the conclu- 
sion that the Mahabharata war was fought in 1931 B. c. Though 
I differ from him in important details, I think that the date 
arrived at by him appears to be one of the two probable or best 
authenticated dates among this-several dates proposed by various 
scholars Prof. P. C. Sen-Gupta contributed a paper to the Journal 
of the Bengal Asiatic Society in 1937, vol. Ill pp 101-119, in 
which he discusses the date of the Mahabharata war and arrives 
at the conclusion that the Bharata war was fought about 2449 
B c. This also is a very probable date and has the authority 
of the tradition mentioned in the Brhatsamhita that the saka 
era is 2526 years after the era of Yuddhisthira. In J. A, S. B. 
for 1938, vol IV pp 393-413 Prof. Sen^Gupta again examines 
Bharata battle traditions' and confirms the date 2449 B. C 
already arrived at by him. Dr. K. L. Daftari delivered some 
lectures in the University of Kagpur on 'the astronomical 
method and its application to the chronology of Ancient India ' 
which are published in book form ( Nagpur, 1942 ) This work 
exhaustively deals with almost all the passages of astronomical 
importance contained in the Mahabharata and is characterized 
by great industry, patient calculations and ingenious explana- 
tions of conflicting passages His conclusion is that the Bharata 
war was fought in 1197 B.C. Although one feels nothing but 
™S * or tbe authOT *s great learning and acumen, it is 
not possible to agree with the date arrived at by him or with

the method and theories adopted by Mm. Apart from details 
one cannot accede to the following theories propounded by lnm 
viz, his division of the astronomical references into two groups, 
-his assumption that a passage in the Dronaparva ( chap 184 ) 
about the rising of the moon at about 2A.M is an interpolation 
( because it does not square with his explanations of the other 
passages ), his bold expedient of changing ' citram ' to ' caitSm ' 
in Bhisma 3 12 and his transposition of Sravana and Pusya in 
Salyaparva 34. 6, his taking ' angaraka ' to mean Venus ( and 
not Mars ). Dr. Daftan's work was reviewed by Prof Sen-Gupta 
in JASB for 1943, vol. IX pp. 221-328 and after submitting it 
to a searching analysis and calculations, the learned Professor 
arrives at the conclusion that he cannot accept Dr. Daftan's 
method, which is useless for all practical purposes. Prof K. V. 
Abhyankar contributes an article to the Annals of B. 0. E. J, 
for 1944, vol. XXV. pp. 116-136 on 'the date and time of the 
Bharata war ', in which he takes into account only the material 
available in the Epic itself and bases his conclusions on 
the principle of following the voice of the majority. He 
furnishes a useful table in an appendix that shows at a glance 
some of the important astronomical passages of the Mahabharata 
with their interpretations given by the commentators Arjuna- 
misra and Nilakantha and by Mr. Karandikar and himself and 
finally gives his opinion that the traditional view of the date 
(3101 B c ) is approximately correct. It appears that he had 
not, when he wrote the article, the work of Dr Daftari before 
him nor Prof. Sen-Gupta's devastating criticism of it. It will 
be apparent from the above that the attempts to settle the exact 
date of the Mahabharata war on the strength of the ««r«KHi»Bl 
materials contained therein are dismal failures Hardly any

ended with amavasya (i. e whether they were amaida) or whether 
they ended with Full Moon ( L e. whether they were 
punfttnanla ). 1766 That a purnimanta month was in vogue in 
Vedio times is beyond dispute. For example, Tai. S states 
that Purva PhalgunI is the last night of the year and Uttara 
Phalgunt is the mouth (i. e. beginning) Similarly Tai 
S V£L 4. 8. % declares that the citrapurnatnasa is the mouth of 
the year ; while San Br. 1Y. 4 declares that the PhalgunI Paurna- 
m§sl is the imikha of the year. The author or authors of the 
Mahabharata, in describing the evil portents of an impending 
tragic or catastrophic event, often assemble together ( as in 
TTdyoga 143.5-29, Bhlsma 2 16-33 ) all of them irrespective of the 
fact whether some of them are possible in the very order of 
nature For example, it is stated that Aiundhati went before 
Vasistha ( Bhlsma 2. 31 ), that a mare gave birth to a cow calf 
and that a bitch gave birth to a jackal (Bhlsma 3. 6 ) and that 
images of gods trembled, laughed and vomited blood ( Bhlsma 
2. 26, which may be compared with Brhatsamhita 45. 8 and the 
verses of Garga Quoted by Utpala thereon ) ; it is several times 
said that the Moon and the Sun are seized ( i e. eclipsed } at

Further, these very verses state that the eclipses of the Sun 
and the Moon took place on the same dan and on the 13th and 
in the same month. Dr. Daftari interprets ' ekahna ' as mean- 
ing on the same week-day and ' on the 13th tithi * { pp. 5-6 of 
his work) calculated according to the wrong method of those 
days. It ib extremely doubtful whether week-days had been 
known or named at the time of the Bharata war or even at the 
time of the composition of the Epic. It is too much to assume 
that the astronomers of the Mababharata war days, while they 
could predict eclipses and state accurately the position of the 
planets, were so clumsy as to allow a mistake of two hMs to 
occur in their calendar with respect to the occurrence of a solar 
eclipse. The words in Bhlsmaparva 3. 28 and 32-33 appear to 
be a mere exaggerated statement of portents. If real observed 
eclipses are meant they would have to be taken in the order of 
the words in the text, viz. first an eclipse of the Moon (on 
Kartika paurnima ) and then an eclipse of the Sun ( on Kartika 
amavasya) and further it must be assumed that the dark half 
of Kartika contained only 13 days. Dr. Daftari (pp. «htt of 
his work ) holds that fiiBt there was a solar eclipse on. Asvina 
amavasyfi, then a lunar eclipse and then again a solar eclipse. 
In that case we should expect the order to be sury^candrau 
and not « candrasuryaa ". Besides, hardly any ofcer scholar 
holds that there were three eclipses one after another. There- 
fore it is hardly possible to say with certainty feat the author 
Srately staL astronomical facte observed by him or even

as a rhetorical device. In Brhatsamhita 5. 26, 97-98 VaTaha- 
miliira states the evil consequences if a moon eclipse precedes 
or follows a sun eclipse in the period of one fortnight. 

Most of the important astronomical details will now be 
set out from the time when Lord Krsna is said to have started 
as a peace-maker to the Kauravas. In Udyogaparva 83. 6-7 ms 
it is said that Krsna started in the month of Kartika (Kaumude 
masi) at the end of tlte iarad season and about the advent of 
winter, when the moon was in Revatl naksatra and on matt) a 
muhurta. Asvina and Kartika are at present said to form the 
season of iarad, and Margaslrsa and Pausa form luemaitta. This 
verse itself presents a difficulty On the Full Moon day of 
Kartika, the moon is in Krttika naksatra and the moon would 
be in RevatS three' days before i. e. on or about the 12th of the 
bright half of Kartika. If we take this alorig with the words 
'at the end of sarad' it follows that the month was puYmmunta ; 
otherwise ( i. e. if the month were amanla ) it would be highly 
improper to say that the 12th of the bright half of Kartika was 
at the end of Sarad After Krsna failed in his mission he returned 
to the Pandavas ( for all of which we must allow a few days 
after the 12th of Kartika sulda ) and reported what Duryodhana 
and he himself said. Two of the statements reported by him 
are very material Duryodhana said to his allies": 'March 
towards Kuruksetra (for battle); to-day the moon is (in) 
Pusya naksatra \" 69 If Krsna started on his mission when the 
moon was in Revati ( on the 12th of the bright half of Kartika ), 
then these above words must have been uttered in his presence 
on or about the 5th of the dark half of Kartika ( or of Marga- 
slrsa if the month was purnimanta ). Another important state- 
ment is that Krsna in his conversation with Kama ( whom he 
had tried to win over) stated to him: * this is a mild month in

which fodder and fuel can be easily had, which is neither too 
hot nor too cold; on the 7th day (from 'today) there will be 
amavasya ; battle may be joined on that day ; they regard it 
as having Indra for its (guardian) 1770 deity'. Therefore this 
must have been said on or about the Sth of the dark half of the 
month But what was the name of the month ? If the reckon- 
ing was purnimanta, the month must be Margasirsa, but if 
the reckoning was arnanta, the month must be Kartika. The 
words ' this month * taken along with Udyoga 83 6-7 would 
indicate that the month meant was Kartika Further, Indra 
was the deity of Jyestha naksatra and the amavasya ( as stated 
in Udyoga 142. 16-18 ) had Jyestha naksatra. In modern times 
this is possible on Kartika Amavasya, while there cannot be 
Jyestha naksatra in modern times on Margasirsa amavasya, but 
only on or about the 13th of the dark half of it. But this passage 
itself ( Udyoga 142. 16-18 ) is in conflict with Salya 35. 10 
where Krsna says: ' the Kauravas do not act up to my words, 
being driven to do so by the Time Spirit; O ' descendants of 
Pandu, go out ( for battle ) together with me when the moon is 
in Pusya '. If the moon was in Jyestha on amavasya when 
Krsna had proposed to Kama that the waT should be begun, 
this passage of Salyaparva would put the beginning of the 
war 16 or 17 days after Kartika amavasya, which is not war- 
ranted by any other passage and which no scholar puts forward. 
In Udyoga 143 11 it is stated, 177 ' ' the spot on the moon has 
turned away (disappeared) and Rami approaches the Sun 
The exact meaning of the first quarter is not quite clear, borne 
interpret it to mean that ' an eclipse of the Moon has already 
taken place '. The moon looks beautiful with the spot thereon 
(compare Sakuntala I ' mdummapi Inmufn&o, lalsm ItAwtm 
lund.) The disappearance of the spot might have been looked

Pandavas. Later on in Bhlsma % 23 it is stated 1772 that the Moon 
had become devoid of brightness, was without its spot on the Full 
moon day of Kartika and assumed the colour of fire while the 
sky retained its original hue; so that if there was an eclipse 
of the moon it was on Kin ulna, Paivrmma and an eclipse of 
the sun was yet to take place. On the whole, therefore, one 
may assume, though not without hesitation, that the months 
were amamta, that possibly there was an eclipse of the moon on 
Kartika Full Moon when Krsna had gone as a peace-maker and 
that there was a solar eclipse on the amavasya of Kartika just 
about the time the war began. In Salyaparva 56. 10 we again 
meet with the words ( at the beginning of the mace duel ) ' Rahu 
swallowed the Sun at an unusual season'. This passage and 
Ssvamedhika 77. 15 ( Rahur-agrasadadityam yugapat soma- 
meva ca) rather suggest that the eclipse of the sun at an unusual 
time had become a stock example of an evil portent without the 
actual occurrence thereof. The words in Salyaparva refer to 
the last day of the war before the mace duel between Duryodhana 
and Bhlma and the passage says that Rahu seized the sun and 
there was an earth-quake also Hardly any one ( except Dr. 
Baftari) holds that there was another eclipse on the last day of the 
war, when just before the war there already had been an eclipse 
on Kartika amavasya. 

As to the exact M/it and naksali a on which the Great War 
began, there a T e many conflicting statements. In the Bharata- 
bavitrl it is stated that the Bharata war started in the first 
month (i e Margaslrsa ) of Hemanta on the 13th of the bright 
half when the moon was in the naksatra presided over by

Mahabharata, yet it has some traditional value, being probably 
earlier than all the commentators of the Mahabharata and later 
than the text of Sauti. In conflict with this passage of the 
Bharatasavitri we have the words of Udyoga 143. 18 (quoted 
above ) where Ersna says to Kama that battle may be joined 
on amavasya when the moon is in Jyestha. The Mahabharata 
itself states that after the disposition of the vast armies were 
made and commanders were appointed, Duryodhana called 
Uluka and sent him to the Pandavas to inflame their feelings 
with the words"' 4 (Udyoga 160. 93) 'the worship of steel 
( weapons ) has been performed, the site of Euruksetra is dried 
up (has no mud), your horses are well fed, warriors are hired 
by you; fight tomorrow'. This Lobabhihara (or-sara)isthe 
same as the rite of nirajaria ( according to the AmarakoSa] I or is 
performed immediately after nlr&jana (for which see pp. 230-231 
above ). Kautilya (II 30 p. 135) prescribes a nlrajana rite at the 
start of an invasion and when two seasons meet. So a nirajana 
rite on Eartika amavasya would be most appropriate (both 
because a battle was to be begun and because at tht .end of 
KSrtika the season of Sarad ended). TheBrhat S amhita(«

whether Mi. Karandikar is right in saying that LohabhihSra 
(or-sara) refers to Skandasasthl. In the first place, the worship 
of weapons can he done at any time, particularly when a 
battle is to he commenced. In the second place, it is not 
necessary to postulate the lapse of six days and more for the 
sending of Uluka and his return from the time when Krsna 
said that battle may be begun on amavasya. The armies had 
taken up opposite positions on the field of Kuruksetra and 
Uluka could have come and gone in a day or two. Further, we 
have, no evidence that Skanda-sasthi was performed in northern 
India in Margaslrsa, though very late works composed by 
dak&ifStyas like the Nirnayasindhu say that Skandasasthl is the 
same as CampSsasthl in Mahaiastra and is observed on the 6th 
of Margaslrsa. Raghunandana quoting Devlpurana places 
Skandasasthl on Caitra 6th of the bright half and is supported 
by the Matsyapurana quoted above in n.1766. There is no reason 
why the actual fight should commence so late as the 13th day 
of Margaslrsa (or even 11th as Mr. Karandikar suggests ) when 
Krsna Baid that it should he joined on am&vaBya. It is quite 
possible that the war began on or about Kartika amavasya. 
The observance of 'Iohahhihara* does not lead to the certain 
inference that the war was not begun till several days after the 
6th of the bright half of Margaslrsa. Similarly, Mr. Karandi- 
kar says that the moon is ordinarily in Bharanl on the 11th or 
12th of the bright half of Margaslrsa. It may be so. But it is 
possible to have the moon in Bharanl even on the 13th. I am 
inclined to hold that the BhSratasavitrl dates of the beginning 
of the war embody a different tradition altogether from the one 
contained in the Mahabharata itself. The Bharatasavitrl is 
silent about naksatras on which the piincipal events of the 
war took place except at the commencement of the waT It 
mentions no Mhksaya or Mfovrddhi. Krsna Bends a message 
with Uluka to Duryodhana (Udyoga 163.57) 'tomorrow you 
will be seen' (in your true colours) and Arjuna does the same 
(Udyoga 163. 14). 

The Mahabharata nowhere states quite explicitly the Mlu or 
naksalra on which the battle actually commenced We have to 
rely upon various indications to arrive at the tain or naksatra.

he remarks, ' it is 43 days since I left (on a pilgrimage); I start- 
ed when the moon was in Pusya and I have come here again 
oh Sravana' ms . In Salya 35. 13-14 it is stated that Balarama 
went to the river SarasvatI on pilgrimage on 'maitra-naksatra- 
yoga' (i.e. when the moon was m AnurSdha). This conflict 
may be resolved by holding, as Nllakantha does, that Balarama 
■ left the Pandavas on Pusya, reached the SarasvatI on AnurSdha 
and returned on Sravana. If we follow Salya 34.6 the war 
commenced when the moon was in or near Mrgaslrsa (18 
naksatras before Sravana ). ThiB would be in direct conflict 
with a passage in Bhlsmaparva 17.2 that" 76 'on the day of 
battle the moon was in the province of Magha' and also other 
passages that will be indicated later on. This last passage 
should ordinarily mean that the moon was near Magha. Mr. 
Karandikar looks upon Salya 34.6 as an interpolation and 
takes Bhlsma 17 2 to mean that the moon was in an inauspici- 
ous naksatra of the category of MaghS. This would suit 
BharanI but not Bohini or Mrgaslrsa. His meaning is far- 
fetched and he does not explain why BharanI was not directly 
mentioned in the Epic, when in several other places the epic 
doeB mention directly the naksatra concerned. His explanation 
gives the go-by to the 13th MM. Dr. Daftari boldly asserts 
that we must transpose the naksatras ( in Salya 34. 6 ) and reaa. 
'sravane samprayatosmi pusyena punaragatah'. If we once resort 
to these methods followed by these two learned writers, there 
is no knowing where one should stop. There are scholars who

Martha, following to iftaamsa rules of interpretation 
holds that to oonclnding passage {upasamterauakya) is superior 
in strength to passages tot occur at to beginning of a work, 
that to passage in Salya 34 6 is to dominant one and other 
conflicting passages must> either brushed aside or explained 
away in conformity with Salya 34. 6 and gives an explanation 
of ' Maghavisayagah soman' which is quite unsatisfactory. 
Dr Daftari also holds, relying on Atharva Jyotisa, that the 
passage means ' the moon was in Mula' (p. 27 para 62-65 of 
his work 'Astronomical method' &c.) The explanation is 
ingenious but one' fails to see why this round-about way was 
resorted to and why the text did not simply say 'mulanaksatragah 
somah', which violates no metrical requirements. InAnusSsana

by since I laid myBeif down on this { arrow bed ) This is the 
mild month of Magha that is now current, three parts of it 
remain and this fortnight should be iuMa '. Bhisma was struck 
down on the 10th day of the war ; so 67 nights had passed from 
the day when the war began to the day in Magha on which this 
was uttered The difficulty is how to connect ' tribhagasesah ', 
whether as an adjective of ' mSsa ' or of ' paksa '. If we take it 
in the first way, these words were uttered on 8th of Magha 
sukia .* if we take it as an adjective of ' paksa ', then they will 
have to be taken as uttered on the 4th of the bright half or on 
the 4th of the dark half which may be regarded in its astrologi- 
cal effects as equal to iuldapdltsa { though the tithi itself is in 
the dark half ) If the words were uttered on the 8th of Magha 
sukia, theBbarata war began on Kartika amavasya {which 
will be in consonance with Udyoga 1 48. 18 quoted in n 1770). 
Tne passage in Anusasana (167. 26-28) is supported by two other 
passages. AfteT the war was over, Yudhisthira went to the 
capital and stayed there for 50 nights and when he found that

which he takes to mean one hundred minus 58 M e. 42 nights 
and explains pancasatam sat oa ' as equal to 30 This shows 
to what straits commentators' are reduced .when conflicting 
passages have got to be explained away. One more indication 
about the titTu on which the war commenced is afforded by 
Dronaparva chap. 184, where it is stated that a grim fight 
went on till midnight when Ghatotkaca was killed, that the 
fatigued armies then snatched some sleep, that then the moon 
rose at about U.M. ( verse 46 ) and that the fight was then 
resumed 1778 (chap. 186. 1 ' tribhagamatrasesayam ratryam 
yuddham-avartata ) This description of moonrise Bhows that 
Ghatotkaca was killed on or about the 11th of the dark half. 
We know from the Mahabharata itself that Ghatotkaca was kill- 
ed on the night of the 4th day of Drona's command or on the 14th 
day after the war began. This would establish that the war 
began on the 12th or 13fch of the bright half and ended on the 
14th of the dark half or on amavasya of Margasirsa. Dr. Daftari 
holds that this description is an interpolation. 

If we try to find out the naksatra on which the war began, 
we have one sure criterion in Salya 34, 6 viz. that the war 
ended on Sravana naksatra when Balarama returned from 
pilgrimage. 2Tow the moon cannot be in Sravana at all in 
Margasirsa dark half, but may be in it on the first or 2nd of the 
bright half of Pausa. So between the tithi and naksatra as 
disclosed by the Mahabharata itself there is a slight dis- 
crepancy of a day or two. There is another way of looking at 
the data. Bhlsma was waiting for uttarayana to begin and we 
know that he passed away on the 59th day after he was 
mortally wounded on the 10th day of the war. Therefore, a period 
of 67 days ( 58 nights of his lying on arrow-bed plus 9 nights 
of the battle when he slept on his usual bed ) elapsed between 
the beginning of the war and the beginning of Uttarayana, 
which undoubtedly occurred inMsgha in thatyear(as Anusasana 
167. 28 expressly states) The real difficulty » to find out flat 
MM of the commencement of Uttarayana But if we accept the 
approximate tithi and naksatra ( as stated above ) of the end of

the war (ie. Margasirsa amavasya or 1st of Pausa arid Sravana 
naksatra ), uttarayana began 49 days thereafter i. e on or about 
the 4th of the dark half of Magha. According to the Vedanga- 
jyotisa, 4th of the dark half of Magha is one of the tithis on 
which uttarayana may begin ( vide Dikshit's work pp 75, 91 ). 
How scholars accept one of the data and reject others is well 
illustrated here. Ace. to Salya 34 6 the war ended on Sravana 
( and so should have begun when the moo^ was in Mrgasirsa ). 
Ace to the Bharatasavitrl the war began on BhaTani and on 
the 13th of the bright half of Margaslrsa and ended on Ama- 
vasya, ( and therefore the naksatra was Mula or Parvasadha ) t 
Arjunaraisra gives up the naksatras and sticks to the tithis. 
Mr. Karandikar gives up the express verse about Sravana (and 
regards that whole chapter as an interpolation ), he giveB up the 
13th tithi of the beginning of the war as given in the Bharata- 
savitrl, holds that the war began on 11th instead and sticks fast 
to the BharanI naksatra given in the Bharatasavitrl. Dr. 
Daftari altogether changes the reading of Salya 34 6 by 
transposing the naksatras mentioned 

The difference between the day of Uttarayana in Magha 
stated in the Mahabharata and the day thereof at present 
is utilised by scholars for arriving at the date of the Maha- 
bharata war. 

There aTe other data in the Mahabharata from which also 
the date of the Mahabharata war is sought to be deduced. Before 
entering into details, some matters that are accepted by most 
scholars may be stated here. It is generally held that there 
were two eclipses, first, one of the moon immediately followed 
by a solar eclipse, that there was a fortnight of 13 days which 
was looked upon as very unusual and a very evil omen. Vide 
Bhlsma 3 28 quoted m n 1767. In Bhlsmaparva 3 31-32 Vyasa is 
reported as saying, ' I have known amavasya occurring on the 
14th, 15th or 16th day ( of a paksa ), but I do not know an 
amavasya occurring on the 13th day ( of a paksa ) ; both the 
moon and the sun were eclipsed in the same month on the 13th 
day '. In the Mausala-parva 1 ™' 2 18-19, when Krsna, 36 years 
after the war, beheld certain portents it is said, "on observing 
those portents on the amavasya occurring on the 13th day he 
declared ' Balm had made this { 13th day ) appear as the 14th 
and 15th (when usually there is amavasya ) when the B harata

war took place ; to-d<iy it has again occurred for our destruction '. 
From these words it is clear that the occurrence of am avSsya at the 
end of a iw/.»i of 13 days was looked upon as a very evil omen- 
Then many scholars hold that a comet had also appeared at the 
time of the great war Bhlsma i 13 1780 states, ' a -very frightful 
comet stands in the sky covering the constellation of Pusya' 
There are grave doubts whether the stateme nt is made from 
actual observation The appeal ance of a comet has always 
been associated in ancient times with great calamities Compare 
Kumarasambluva II 32 ' upaplavaya lokanam dhfimaketurivot- 
thitah '. As indicated above, the Mahabbaiata gathers together 
several possible and impossible things to emphasize their 
significance as to impending calamities. Therefore the inclu- 
sion of a comet among portents does not establish that a comet 
had actually appeared at the time of the Bharata war. Supposing 
for argument that a comet had appeared, that circumstance is of 
no help at all in settling the date. A large number of comets is 
included in the sun's retinue. Thenumber of cometsof longpenods 
that approach the sun m a centuiy,is said to be 300 There is 
nothing to show what particular comet appeared at the time of the 
war and no one has data 10 connect the MahabharaU oomet with 
Halley's comet or any other comet well-known in modern times 
Therefore the datum about a comet is entirely worthless for 
purposes of chronology According to Brhatsamhita 11. 5 and 
TJtpala thereon the ancient writer ParSsara held the view that 
there were 101 Ketus and Garga said that there were a thousand. 
The description m Bhlsma 3 13 states that the perihelion of the 
comet was m Pusya In Udyogaparva 143 10 it is said since 
a giaha specially afflicts Citra, a great calamity is indeed 
approaching the Kauravas' This may probably refer to a 
comet Two other verses appear to have some bearing on this-

ntru, ( i e it is about to enter into siah ) and Terse 16 says, ' the 
white graha is fieiy like fire emitting smoke and stands occupy- 
ing Jyestha -which is a bright star presided over by Indra'. 
"What is meant by ' white graha ' ? The words ' sveto grahah ' 
sliotild ordinarily denote Venus Nil&kantha takes them to 
mean Ketu ( node ) in Ehfema 3 12 and another comet in 3 16. 
If this latter explanation be accepted there were two comets 
seen at the time. Even if we hold that Bhisma 3. 16 describes 
the tail of the comet mentioned in 3 13, that is of very little 
help All that would be meant would be that the tail of the 
comet was a very long one Bhisma 3.17 has been taken to 
refer to Bahu by Nllakantha, while some modern scholars hold 
that it refers to a comet It means, ' a cruel comet standing 
between Citra andSvati, afflicts Bohmi and also the sun and the 
moon' The description of the Ketu called Sveta in Brhat- 
samhita 11 39 agiees very closely with the description in the 
Bhlsmaparva and Parasara quoted by Utpala thereon states that 
the Ketu called ' Sveta ' becomes visible after 115 years and 
portends the destruction of two-thirds of the population 

Then theTe aTe several passages which state the positions 
of several planets just before the battle or on the day the battle 
began. Here again at least two different positions are assigned 
to each planet except Mercury, It is first to be noted that at 
the beginning of the war all the seven planets excluding Rahu 
and Ketu are declared to have been near each other < Bhisma 
17 3, q in note 1776 above ). We know from the Mahabharata 
itself that tixe Sun and the Moon on Kaitika amavasya were 
in Jyestha It the war began on amavasya or a day later, the 
planets must be near Jyestha If the Bharatasavitrt be follow- 
ed then the war began on M&rgasirsa bright 13 and on Bharani. 
If that were so, the sun and the moon cannot be together. Mr 
Karandikar takes 11th of the bright half of Margaslrsa to be 
the tithi of the beginning of the war and holds that the Sun 
was in naksatra Jyestha and that the moon was in Bharani 
(following the Bharatasavitri as to this last) I should hold 
that we are not at liberty to take one datum from one group of 
statements and another from another group and then say that 
it is proved that the war was fought at a particular time It is 
further noted in Karnaparva 37. 4 that on Kama's death ( i e 
17 days after the war began), the seven planets were seen soins 
away from the Sun »« The positions of the planets at the 
beginning of the war were as follows :—

We find that the Mahabharate employs two classes of expres- 
sions When it UBes words like ' tiisthati ' ( stands ), ' akramya ' 
( having traversed ), 'samvrtya or samparivaTya * (having cover- 
ed or concealed ) it means that the planet was in or very near 
that naksatra When words meaning ' afflicts ( pidayati ) are 
employed, the meaning is probably that the planet has only 
drsti on the naksatra It is impossible to say whether the rules 
and theories about drsti or puma drsti and partial drsti had 
been evolved at the time of the Mahabharata War. If the war 
was fought about 3101 B G or even 1931 B C there is nothing 
to establish that the theories about drsti contained even in 
the Atharvajyofcisa ( which is certainly later than the Vedanga- 
jyotisa of the Rgveda i e much later than about 1200 B. o ) 
were known then Vide under Venus for further difficulties 

JUPITER— Bhisma 3 14 states that Jupiter was retrograde 
in Sravana ; Bhisma 3 27 states, 17SS ' Both 
JupiteT and Saturn that had stayed together 
for a year are neaT Visakha and are both fiery '. 

Jupiter cannot stay for one year in one naksatra ; 
it traverses 21 naksatras in a year. If at the 
time of the war Jupiter was near Visakha. it 
could not have been near it for a year. Eleven 
months before that it would have been very 
near Citra. If it was near Visakha at the time 
of the war and the Sun was in Jyestha, it can 
hardly be correct to say that seven planets had 
come together in the sky (there being a dis- 
tance of about two naksatras or about 26

Jyestha at the time of the waT it could have 
been one year in Visakha about two years 
before the war. What is the propriety of men- 
tioning Saturn's position two years before the 
war ? The relevant point is to state that posi- 
tion at the time of the war Therefore it must 
be held that Bhlsma 3 37 states their position 
at the time of the war and adds one more 
circumstance that they were there for one 
year, 

; Karnaparva 94. 51 says : ' Brhaspati having

VENUS— Bhlsma 3 15 states that Venus 17K having ascend- 
ed (i. e. occupied) the Purvabhadrapada 
naksatia shines charmingly and it looks up 
to Uttarabhadrapada together with(?) The 
meaning of ' parikramya Babitah' is not at all 
clear. However the first half is as clear as 
possible. Venus was in Purva Prosthapada. 
If the Sun was in Jyestha on Kartika amavasya. 
it is impossible that VenuB could have been 
in the 8th naksatra from Jyestha. Venus is 
never more than four naksatras from the Sun 
in the sky. This would completely knock on 
the head the principal statement that seven 
planets were near each otheT Mr. Karandikar 
in desperation suggests that we should under- 
stand Parvasadha, for 'Prosthapade Purve' 
and also that the word ' Prosthapade ' was an 
interpolation inserted by some busy body later 
on. As I have frequently said above, this is a 
most unjustifiable way of dealing with the so- 
called astronomical data in the Mahabharata. 
' Prosthapade Purve ' can never mean * PQrva- 
sadha'. IntiieTai.aiV.4. 10. 1-3, and the 
Tax. Br. I 5. 1 and HI. 1. 1 the word Prostha- 
pada is expressly employed for Purva Bhadra- 
pada. Why should one word in a verse be 
held to he interpolated ? Is it because it does 
not agree with one's hypothesis ? In Salya 11. 
18 Venus and Mars are said to be in conjunc- 

Bharamas the Bbjtratasavitri says, then at 
the fame of the mace-duel the moon might be 
in Jyestha and therefore both Mars and Venus 
will have to be in Jyestha. But this is oppos- 
ed to two of the passages cited above referring 
to the position of Mars. If the war began on 
Jyestta and Kartika arnavasya, then on the

or not VemiB is often called *Sita' in 
ancient astronomical works (e. g in Brhat- 
samhife 9. 42, 45 ). 

SATURN— We have four statements about Saturn. In 
Udyogal43 8 we read,™ - A Iefu i gent and 
malignant planet, Saturn, afflicts the naksatra 
presided over by Prajapati (i. e Eohmi)', 
Bhlsma 2 32 states, ' Saturn afflicts Eohmi': 
Bhfsma 3. 14 says, 'the naksatra presided over 
by Bhaga is covered and afflicted by Saturn *. 
Jupiter and Saturn aTe near Vi&akha (Bhlsma 
3.27 considered above). In the first tbsee passages 
the root 'pid.' occurs and therefore it is possible 
to argue that some land of aspect (drsti or 
ledka ) of the naksatra mentioned in the text is 
meant. But in the third passage both 'skramya' 
and 'pidyati' are used about the same naksatra. 
ThiB makes that passage inexplicable in the 
usual way The ' piajapatya naksatra ' must 
be Eohmi as in the 2nd passage Robml is 
expressly named All authorities agree that 
Prajapati is the deity of RohinT ' Prajapatya 
naksatra' cannot he taken to mean Mula, 
since the presiding deity of Mula is ' pitarah '

Prajapati only in some later works Bhaga is 
the presiding deity of Uttara Phalgunl m the

HI ] Astronomical data m Mahabharata 923 

The above detailed statement about the astronomical 
passages of the Mahabharata -will induce any unbiassed reader 
who has no axe to grind that they are hopelessly inconsistent 
and that no certain chronological conclusion can be drawn 
therefrom In the above discussion 1 have generally not cited 
the various explanations indulged in by several scholars, as that 
would have involved me in a very lengthy discourse -without 
any adequate benefit To me it appears probable that the final 
redactor of the Mahabharata had two or more sets of astronomical 
data about the war before him and without trying to examine 
and sift them he included them all in his work. The Bharata- 
savitri probably represents one (and a later) tradition about 
the positions of the planets at the time of the war. As I hold 
that either the Mahabharata passages on the positions of the 
planets ware interpolated at a very late stage or are hope- 
lessly inconsistent I deem it unnecessaiy to enter upon an 
examination of the mathematical calculations made by several 
scholars to find out the date of the Bharata war from the shift- 
ing of the solstices and the position of the planets. 

Since only 5046 years have elapsed (in 1945 A. D ) from 
the beginning of the Kali age and as Kaliyuga extends to 
432000 years according to Paur&nic computations we are just 
on the threshold of the Kaliyuga and it is beyond one's com- 
prehension to visualize what will happen towards the end of the 
vast penod of about 427000 years that are still to pass before 
Kaliyuga ends It is very sraa u consolation to read in the 
Puranas in a prophetic strain that at the end of that colossal 
period Visnu will ba incarnated as Kalkin in a village Sam- 
bhala, will destroy all Mlechhas, sudra kings and heretics and 
will establish dharma, so that the Krta age will then be ushered

m the legend of Kalkin In 1 A vol 48 pp. 123-128 Prof. H B, Bbide 
tries to show how Jain authorities about Kalkm are conflicting Mr K. P. 
Jayaswal in I. A. vol 46 (for 1917} p. 145 holds that Kalkin must be 
identified with the great hero Yasodharman who ruled over India -from the 
Brahmaputra to the Western Ocean and from the Himalaya to Mabendra 
and who conquered the Hun Mihirafcnla and made him pay homage to his 
feet as stated in the Mandasor Inscription (vide Gupta Ins. p. 149). 
Prof Pathak on the other hand relying upon certain Jama sources identifies 
Kalkm with Mibirakula himself (I A for 1918 at p. 19). Otto Schraoer 
,n BrahmavidyS vol I pp 17-27 discusses how the names Kalfan or KaUi 
came to be given to the saviour of India from Mlecchas, heretics and the 
hke. Kalka means ' sin ' or ' sediment ' and Karka means • a white horse . 
Therefore he thinks that Kalk.n ,s a form of kartm ( one r.d.ngj » white 
horse). Vide also N I A vol. IV pp 337-343 (on Kalk. from the Kalk.

he is said to have already flourished ( V&yu 98. Ill, Matsya tf {■ 
255 ), in other places the texts employ the future ( Vayu 99. i»b, 
Bhagavata XH 2. 16). This last discrepancy is probably 
due to the fact that the writers sometimes forget their role ol 
prophets. Further, it has to be remembered that according to 
the Puranas the four yugas (and therefore the Kalki avatara) 
have been repeated again and again. The Kalki-purana ( L %. 
33 and I 3 3S-33) states that Kalki was a contemporary of 
Visakhayupa king of Mahismati, while the V|,yu (99. 312-314), 
Matsya ( Z72. 4 ) and Visnu (IV. U) state that Visakhayupa waB 
the 3rd of the Pradyota dynasty that preceded the SisunSga 
dynasty. Though the Kalki-purana several times uses the paBt 
tensa about Kalki, yet at the very beginning it says (110) 
that what is narrated is an akhyana (story) of the future

Visnuvardhana is the same as Yasodharman (in 'Imperial History ' pp. 39- 
41 ) and that Visnuvardhana was the overlord of Baladitya. It appears 
likely that the compters of the extant Puranas combined the two principal 
parts of the two names Visnuvardhana and Yasodharman and that the con- 
queror of the Mlecchas was said to be Visnuyasas Vide I H Q. vol. XII

commander-in-chief of the Brjapur araiy, is made to say to 
Khawaskhan, the Vazir, as follows, 'In the Hindu sastras some 
say that Kalkin, the 10th avatara of Visnu will be born and he 
will destroy the hordes of Yavanas. Shivaji appears to be the 
first harbinger of that Kalkin' . 

Even though the Puranas are carried away by their over- 
zeal in condemning the moral and physical decline of the Kali 
age, almost all of them exhibit no verses about matters for- 
bidden in the Kali age. We have to see when the topic of 
Kahmrpja attained prominence and what the matters are that 
were once practised by people without objection and that later 
on came to be prohibited or condemned. 

The Ap. Dh S (II 6. 14. 6-10) condemns the practice 
of giving all or most of the ancestral property to the eldest son 
as opposed to sastras. The Ap. Dh. S ( II 10 27. 2-6 ), after 
referring to the view of some that a woman when being married 
is given to the whole family of the bridegroom, condemns the 
practice of mi/oqa. 1 ™ 9 Both these practices (of uddhaiambhaga and 
of niijoqa ) are among those included m the texts on Kahvarjya. 
Among the earliest references in the smrtis to practices once 
current, but forbidden in the Kali age is a passage of BrhaBpati 
quoted by Apararka p 97, where myoga and the nu mer0 "6 
secondary sons are said to be impossible owing to the decadence 
of spiritual power among men of the Dvapara and Kali ages. 
Apararka p 739 and the D M quote a passage of Saunaka to 
the effect that sons other than the aurasa oi dattaka are not 
allowed in the Kali age"' 1 Piajapati ( verse 151 ) refers"' to 
the ancient practice of offering meat and wine in swddhas, bui 
prescribes that these should be eschewed in the Kali age

the setting of the three vedic fires and of resorting to aannyasa 
after 4400 years of Kali. The Laghu-Asvalayana 17 '* smrti 
( 21 14-15 ) states that the two kinds of sons called Kunda and 
Golafca were permitted in former ages and had the samskaras 
performed on them, but are condemned in the Kali age. Visva- 
rupa and Medhatithi, it is worth noting, do not quote a single 
verse about Kalivarjya. On Taj. HL 30 Visvarupa tries to recon- 
cile Parasara HI 5 (saying that a hrahmana who is learned in 
the Veda and keeps the sacred Vedic fires becomes free from im- 
purity in a day ) with ParasaTa HI 8 ( that for ten days on 
impurity due to birth or death the food of that family becomes 
unpaTtakahle for others). He does not accept the idea that 
the period of impurity is only one day for a learned man, but 
explains that Parasara DDL 5 is only an arlhavUda meant for 
glorifying the study of Veda and the keeping of sacred fires. 
Among later commentators it is stated that the narrowing down 
of the periods of impurity on the ground of Veda study is 
forbidden in the Kali age. As this explanation is not offered 
by Visvarupa it is not unreasonable to infer that Visvarupa 
was not awaTe of the passage on this point quoted from the 
Adityaparana. Medhatithi"'* also ( on Manu IX. 112 ) refers to 
the opinion of some that the smrti passages about niyoga and 
uddbara-vibhaga were applicable only in bygone ages, since 
smrtis are restricted to certain ages ( vide Manu 1 85 ) ; but he 
refutes that view and explains Manu I 85 by saying that the 
meaning is that the dharmas (i e qualities or natures of things) 
change from age to age as they do from season to season Srom

In the passage quoted the several Kalivarjyas are not

which they appear in the extract and lastly those that do not 
appear in that extract will also be dealt with. The first verse states 
that certain actions were discarded by the wise though this was 
unauthorized ( by sruti or smrti ) after arriving at a convention 
among themselves through fear of the loss of dharma { if they 
were persisted in ), because in the Kali age there is absence of 
good men. The last verse and a half again state that at the 
beginning of the Kali great men arrived at certain conven- 
tions and discarded certain actions in order to guard the people 
( against harm and gin ) and ( it is well known ) that the conven- 
tions of good men are authoritative like Veda 1805 .

2. Appointing the husband's brother ( or a sagotra &c. ) 
to raise issue on the •wife of a sonless man. Thfe is called rdyoga 
and has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 599- 
607. It may be added here that in the K. V. N. there is a long 
discussion on the question whether an elder brother of the 
deceased could have been appointed to raise issue on his younger 
brother's widow and gives it as the opinion of some that he could 
not be so appointed, but that only a younger brother could be 
appointed to raise issue on his elder brother's widow. They rely 
on the Mit. on Yaj. I. 68 where' devara'* is paraphrased aB 
' fcanlyan bhrata '. The K. V. N. ( folio 5 b and 6 a ) relying on 
Manu IX. 62 and the words of the Mit on Yaj. II 127 { where 
Manu IX. 69-70 are cited and explained as * devaras-tasya 
jyesthah kanistho va ) holds that any brother whether elder or 
younger than the husband could be appointed. 

3. The admission of several kinds of secondary sons

of sapinda relationship, pp. 497 ffi. for prohibition on the ground 
of gofcra and pp. 458-463 for marriage with maternal uncle's 
daughter. The custom of marrying the maternal uncle's daughter 
has persisted to this day in many castes in spite of the inclusion 
of it among Kalivarjyas. An inscription at Nagarjunikonda 
( 3rd century A. D.) shows that Vlrapurusa-datta, son of Santa- 
mfila, married three daughters of his paternal aunts ( E. I. vol 
XX p. 1 ). 

7. Slaying a brahmana who comes as an Statayin in a 
properly conducted fight Vide H. of Dh. vol. IT. pp. 148-151 
and p. 517 above for this subject 

8. Awarding of fines against witnesses who depose in 
disputes between father and eon 180s It has already been seen 
( p 299 ) how ordinarily suits between husband and wife, father 
and son were not encouraged in ancient India. But when such 
a dispute came to the king's notice he could take action suo 
motu, as NSr. includes ' pitaputra-vivada ' among the miscella- 
neous matters ( praklrnaka verse 3 ) which the king was to set 
in motion. Even in ancient times this rule must not have been 
strictly enforced. As time went on and separation of father and 
son became frequent the rule must have appeared to be un- 
reasonable. Vide Mit. on YSj. IL 32 referred to above in n. 418. 
YSj. IL 239 ( = Matsya 227. 198) prescribed a fine of 3 panas 
for those who ( instead of composing the quarrel between father 
and son and being able to do so ) undertake to be witnesses. 
Visvaruparead 'a fine of two hundred panas . Vis*. l Dh. b 
V 120 prescribes a fine of ten panas. This shows that at tbe 
timeofL Mateyapurana this act was probably not mcluded 
among Kalivarjyas.

words of Manu XI. 16 'bhaktani sad-anasnata .. hartavyam 
hinakarmanah ). In ancient times theft of such a minor nature 
was permitted when the brahmana was famished. But later 
times took a stricter view of the matter. 

10. 'The admission to intercourse of a brahmana who 
undertakes a sea voyage, even though he may have performed, 
the penance prescribed for the same * ( I. 7 in the appendix ) 
Here the word used is ' dvijasya '. It may mean either any 
person of the three higher castes or a brahmana. If a man who 
has made a sea voyage took prayascitta he expiated only the 
sin, but did not become fit, according to this dictum, to be 
associated with by others. Whether the Vedic Aryans knew 
the sea has been doubted. Vide ' Vedic Index * on ' samudra ', 
vol. H. pp. 431-433. The Nirukta II. 10 refers to the fact that a 
doubt arises whether the word ' samudra ' in a particular vedic 
verse refers to the sea or to the sky. In some verses as in 
Rg X. 98. 5 'he discharged divine rain waters from the higher 
to the lower samudra* both the meanings of 'samudra' (viz. 
Bea, sky ) are pointedly brought out. Vide also $g. VII. 6. 7 
( a samudrad-avarad-a parasmst ). In $g. V1L 95. 2 SarasvatI is 
mentioned as going from the mountains to the sea In Rg. X. 
136. 5 the two seaB, Eastern and Western, are mentioned (ubhau 
saraudrava kseti yaica purva utaparah ), In Jig. VJII. 6. 4 it is 
said, ' all people bend down to him, as the siridhus (rivers ) flow 
to the Ocean.' fcg. L 116. 4-5, X. 39. 4 and X. 143. 5 refer to the 
story that Asvins saved Bbujyu from the waters of the sea wo 9 
1 he Atharvaveda XL 2. 25 refers to eastern sea and northern sea 
There is no doubt that in the Brahmanas the sea was well-known. 
The Tai Br. IL 2. 5. 6 remarks, « there is no end to desire and also 
to samudra (neva hi kamasyantosti na samudrasya). The 
Ait. Br 40 2) remarks 'just as the sea stands surrounding 
the earth (tabhl rajanam parigrhya tisthati samudra iva 
bhutnim). It has already been seen that among the fivo 
practices peculiar to the north the Baud. Dh. S (LI 22 ) 
enumerates sea voyage ( samudra-isainyana ) as the ' last 
and condemns it. Baud. (IL 1. 51) places sea voyage at 
the head. of grave sins (patanhjam) along with misappro- 
priating a brahmana's wealth kept as a deposit. The Mit.

on Y&j. III. 288 quotes the sutra of Baud. Manu (DI158 
and 166-167 ) provides that a brahmana who had been on s 
soa voyage was sinful and was not to be invited at a 
sr&ddha. But it is clear that Manu does not say that such 
a brahmana altogether loses caste or that he becomes alto- 
gether unfit to bo associated with; all that Manu provides is 
that such a brahmana became unfit for invitation at a sraddha. 
The Ausanasasmrti ( IV. pp. 525-526 ) declares that those who 
sell the Veda, who marry a widow, who undertake a sea voyage 
are paitla and are not to be invited at a sraddha. These passages 
show that the prohibition against sea voyage affected only 
brahmanas and even then they did not apparently become alto- 
gether unfit to be associated with. That brahmanas crossed the 
ocean and went to such distant countries as Siam, Cambodia, 
Java, Sumatra and Borneo can be easily proved ,w °. E. I. vol 
17 p. 314 gives references to inscriptions from Borneo to show 
that brahmanas from India migrated to that country about 400 
A. D. That kings and merchants undertook sea voyageB iB also 
clear from several considerations. The Baveru Jstaka ( vol. HI 
JSo 339,Fausboll) tells us that merchants from Benares went 
to Babylon in order to sell Indian goods. The 'Questions^ of 
Milinda' S. B. E. vol. 36 p. 269 Tefers to a ship-owner voyaging 
by sea to distant countries 1811 . The Rajataranginl refers to 
the sea voyage of an envoy of king JaySpIda <J Kashmir '*> 
Ceylon (IV 503-506). Manu Vm. 157 prescribes that the

places determine to be the proper one. Yaj. II. 38 provides 
for very high interest ( 20 per cent per month ) from those who 
engage in trade by sea. Nar. IV. 179 says that a trader (eamu- 
dra-vanik ) who makes sea voyages is not a proper witness. 
The Vayu ( 45. 78-80 ) and other puranas state that Bharata- 
varsa 1 *' 2 has nine divisions called doipas, all of which are 
separated from each other by the sea and are not (easily 
accessible, that Jambudvlpa ( India proper ) is the 9th dvlpa and 
the other eight are Indra, Kaseru, Tamraparnl, Gabhastimat, 
Naga, Saumya (Siam?), Gandharva, VSruna (Borneo'). 
Therefore Bharatavarsa according to Pauranic Geography in- 
cluded modern India and also Greater India. Hone of the 
ancient works at least says" anything against sudras under- 
taking sea voyages; but now even sudras, probably in their 
desire to emulate the brahmana and rise higher in social esteem, 
think that sea voyage is forbidden to them also. 

When during the latter half of the 19th century some 
brahmanas went to England on a political mission or for study 
and returned to India, the question whether after taking the 
appropriate prMyaiatta those brahmanas could be associated with 
fully as before was referred to many orthodox and learned 
JPanrftfe (such as the late TarSnatha Tarkavacaspati ) and 
it is creditable to the Pandits and gratifying to note that 
many of them came to the conclusion that they could be asso- 
ciated with by others. The two principal texts referred to were 
those of the Brhan-Naradapurana (note 1798 above) and the 
one from the Adityapurana translated at the head of this parti- 
cular Kalivaijya. Very interesting and hairsplitting argu- 
ments and explanations were advanced by the learned Pandits 
m 1872. Some of them may be noted here. As regards the 
Naradlya passage, it is argued that only that seavoyage is for- 
bidden in the Kali, which was a righteous act (dharma) in 
former times. In Parasara-smrti XE. 58 the following praya- 
scitta 18 * is prescribed for brahmana murder : "the sinner should

be^directed to perform the penance of going to the seta on the 
ocean ; lie should beg for alms on the road to the sBtu from 
men of the four classes that are free from improper acts, should 
walk barefooted and without umbrella, should declare his sin 
in all towns, villages and hamlets of cowherds on the way 
while resting there or in forests, sacred places and rivers and 
after reaching the sea and on seeing the sefcu, 200 yojanas long 
and 10 yojanas broad, constructed with heaps of stones at the 
bidding of Rama by Nala he will get rid of the sin of brShmana 
murder '. Here brahmana murder being a most heinous offence 
it cannot be supposed that a mere sight of the sebu from land 
would absolve the sinner and the words about the length and 
breadth of the setu would be otherwise meaningless. Therefore 
what'is meant is that he must undertake a sea-voyage and go 
along the whole length and breadth of the setu an a vessel. 
Such a voyage was religious conduct in former ages, but in 
Kali this is forbidden. The word 'holding a kamandalu" 
( which also was prescribed as dharma in former ages ) conveys 
that a similar or analogous practice is referred to in the imme- 
diately preceding words. The words ' dvijasyabdhau &e. are to 
be interpreted as follows : * nauyStuh ' is the genitive singular of 
* nauyatr '. The affix * tr " is not the ordinary V but it is fan 
used in the sense of * one who habitually does a thing , accord- 
ing to Panini m. 3. 134-135. im Therefore the words of the 
Adityapurana apply only to a dvija who habitually «>*««» 
a sea voyage either as a trader or as a helmsman or sailor. When 
Narada(Dayabhaga21) states that even an aurasa son who 
is hostile to his father or who is patita ( guilty of one of the 
five great sins) or is impotent or is ' apayatrita he doe, not

crossing the sea to Ceylon for purposes of trade. In dramas like 
the Katnavali (where the kancuhn Babhravya undertakes a 
sea voyage and a merchant from KausSmbI is said to have gone 
to Ceylon ) and in romances like the DasakumSracarita frequent 
references are made to sea voyages to Ceylon and other countries. 
What is aimed to be hit when prayascitta for sea voyage is 
prescribed is the fact that on such voyages a man may give up 
for long such daily duties as the performance of sandhya and may 
have come in very close contact with mlecchas as regards food 
etc. If he has done these two, then only he is not fit for inter- 
course even though he may have undergone a prayascitta If 
he performs his daily duties wherever he may dwell and does 
not come in too close a contact with mlecchas he may have to 
perform no prayascitta, much less would he become" unfit for 
social intercourse. The view of Medhatithi on Manu n. 23 that 
any country by itself is not unfit for the residence of an arya, 
that if mlecchas overrun a country in India and permanently 
reside there it may become a mleochadesa, that even a mleccha 
country, if it be conquered by an Indian king and if the system 
of the four varnas be introduced therein, would be a fit one for the 
performance of Vedic sacrifices, has already been noted { in H of

The Smrtikausfcubha explains that ' samudrayatra ' means 
' tlrthayatra * i e. pilgrimage to holy places beyond the sea and 
that is forbidden here. But this seems to be wrong, as stated 
by Krsnabhatta on the Nir. S. The latter sayB that expiation 
is to be undergone only where a sea voyage is undertaken from 
worldly motives, but where a sea voyage has to be undertaken 
for reaching a holy place like the SankhoddhSra-tlrtha, it is an 
inseparable part of the pilgrimage and therefore there is no 
necessity to undergo a prayascitta, 1815 

11. ' The initiation for a sattm ' (1.8) Sattras were sacri- 
ficial sessions the duration of which varied from 12 days to a 
year, 12 years or even more. Only brahmanas could perform 
them ( Jai. VI 6 16-23 ). Ace. to Sahara on Jai. VI. 2. 1 per- 
sons who engaged in them must not be less than 17 nor more 
than 24 All of them were both saorificers ( yajamana ) as well 
as priests. Vide H. of Dh. vol. H pp. 1239-1246 for sattras. 
The prohibition against engaging in sattras is a clear indica- 
tion that people had become tired of the ancient Vedic sacriBceB, 
of the great demands they made on time and wealth and had 
begun to prefer other and easier modes of worship. 

12. 'Carrying a jar of water' (1. 8). The Baud.DLS 
I 4 devotes numerous" 16 sutras ( 1-27 ) to the sublet of carry- 
ing an earthen or wooden jar full of water. Every snataka was 
always to carry a 3 ar of water from which he was to take water 
for imwa He was to wash it with water and rub it w.tl his 
hand. This was declared to be equal to pxryagmtoram I encir-

SgTSSuVI.aiandYai.ia. 55 a forest hermit when he 
2£ta an incurable disease and could ^Perform the 
duties of his order, « allowed to start towards , the norfe-east 
on the Great Journey ( mateprastbana ) till the hody fell down 
to rise no more. Similarly, a man guilty of brahmana murder 
was allowed to meet death at the handts of archers or to throw 
himself head foremost into are. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 924- 
928 for Mahsprasthanagamana Apararka™ (p. 877 -879) 
quotes long passages from the Adipur&na to the effect that if a 
man suffering from an incurable disease starts on the Great 
Journey in the Himalaya or commits suicide by entering fire 
or water or by falling from a precipice, not only does he not 
incur sin, but on the contrary he goes to heaven. It is rather 
inconsistent that the Adipurana ( or JLflityapurana ) should in 
one place extol the starting on the Great Journey and in another 
place should forbid it in the Kali age. The K. V. N. cites the 
instance of the Fandavas that are said to have started on the 
Great Journey. This makes one suspicious about the authenticity 
of the passages on Kalivarjya quoted from the Adityapurana 
by some and from Idipurana by others. 

14. 'The killing of a cow in the sacrifice called GoBava ' 
(1.9). 

There were various occasions on which in ancient times 
a cow was sacrificed The Anubandhya cow killed at the end 
of the TJdayanlya isti in Agnistoma has been referred to above 
(on p. 627 a 1196). In the Madhuparka which was offered

bull was killed as an offering in the rite called sfilagava ('vide 
H.of Dh. vol. H pp. 831-832). As flesh-eating came to be 
looked down upon, oow sacrifice became most abhorrent and 
Kalivarjya texts only register a prohibition which had been 
acted upon centuries before. 

15. 'The employment of cups of wine in the Sautramanl ' 
(1.10). 

The Sautramanl is not a soma sacrifice but it is a combi- 
nation of an ish with an animal sacrifice. It was so called 
from|sutraman' (an epithet of Indra). Its peculiar charac- 
teristic was the offering of sura m cups. In modern times milk 
is offered in its place and £p Sr. allowed it even in ancient 
times 1819 . It was included among the seven hewirt/ajnas by 
Gaut. ( VHL 20 ). At the end of the Rajasuya it was performed 
or in Agnicayana or for one who suffered vomiting or purging 
from the excessive drinking of soma. For sautramanl and the 
preparation of sura in it, vide H. of Dh. vol. H. pp. 1225-1228. 
Bhattoji (in com. on Qaturvimsati-mata p. 53) and the Nirnayo- 
sindhu construe this to mean 'having social intercourse with 
one who employs sura in Sautramanl' but this is not satis- 
factory. The Dharmasindhu explains as above (lit pfirvardha 
p. 357)" 20 .

16. ' The licking of the Agnihotrahavani and the use of 
it even after it was licked * ( 1. 11 ) In the Agnihotra the sruva 
ladle is held in the right hand and the sruc called agnihotra- 
havani is held in the left and the milk is poured into the latter 
from the milk pot with sruva. After the Agnihotra homa is 
offered the agnihotrahavani is licked twice in order to take out 
the remnants of the milk and after wiping it with darbha blades 
it is used again. Ordinarily a vessel when it is once licked by 
a man cannot be used again in a religious rite unless proper 
purification is resorted to. But this did not apply to the Agni- 
hotrahavani and camasas of soma. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 1002, 
n. 2663 for agnihotrahavani, p. 1005 for its licking and p. 1177 
(n. 2598) for the drinking of soma from the same camasa by 
the several priests. The licking of the agnihotrahavani and 
its use constitute really the subject of the prohibition. 1821 

17. ' Entering on the stage of forest hermit as laid down 
in the texts about if (1. 12). Gaut. HI 25-34, Ap. Dh. S 
(II. 9. 21. 18 to H. 9. 23. 2 ), Manu VI. 1-32, Vas IX 1-11, Yaj. 
HI. 45-55 lay down elaborate rules for the stage of forest hermitB. 
Vide H. of Dh vol H pp. 917-929 for a description and remarks 
on sannyasa to be made> later on. 

18. ' The narrowing down or curtailment of the periods of 
impurity depending upon the Vedio learning and the mode of 
life of a person ' ( 1. 13 ). ' Agha ' means ' asauca ' ; ' vrtta ' 
(mode of life) refers to tending sacred fires or maintaining 
oneself in the way described by Manu IV. 7-10. The general 
rule about the period of impurity for a brahmana on the death 
of a sapinda was stated by Gaut. 14. 1, Manu V. 59 and 83 to be 
that it was ten days and Angiras quoted by the Mit. on Yaj IIL 22 
prescribes impurity for ten days for all varnas, but Manu V. 59 
also spoke of the period being four days, three days or one day 
which, ace to the Mit. on Yaj. IIL 28-29, refers respectively to* 
kumbhldhanya, one who has collected food for three dayB or one 
who collects nothing for the morrow. Daksa VL 6 and Para-

vara ( end of 11th century ) was not aware of the prohibition of 

the curtailment of the periods of impurity or treated it with 

scant respect. The curtailment of the period of impurity was 

laid down probably because curtailment led to confusion, since 

a person may claim to be learned, while his neighbours may 

not concede that claim. 

19. ' Prescribing death as the penance for brahmanas ' 
( 1. 14 ) 

Manu XT. 89 provides that if a person intentionally murders 
a brahmana there is no expiation for it. Manu XI 90 prescribes 
death by drinking boiling wine for the sin of drinking sura, 
while Manu XL 146 provides im that if a man knowingly drinks 
wine there is no expiation for it, but only death. The Visnu- 
dharmasutra ( chap. 34 ) states that incest with the mother, 
daughter or daughter-in-law is atipataka, such sinners have to

enter fire and there is no other penance for this sin. Vide Gaut. 
21. 7 also. Some smrtis held that there was no-prSyascitta for 
certain grave sins except falling from a precipice or into fire. 
An a brahmana's person became more and more sacred with the 
march of time, death ceased to be a penance for a brahmana 
sinner, however grave the sin might be But this did not apply 
to a ksatriya or any one else ( other than a brahmana ). 

20. ' Pollution through contact with a sinner * ( 1. 15 ). 
Manu XL 180 ( = SSnti 165. 37 = Baud. Dh. S. H. 1. 88 ), 1825 
Visnu Dh. S. 35. 2-5 provide that if a person continues for one 
year in close association ( samsarga ) with one guilty of the 
grave sins ( enumerated in Manu XI. 54 }, in respect of occupy- 
ing the same conveyance or seat with him or dining in the 
same row with him he becomes patita ; but he becomes patita 
immediately if he officiates as a priest for such a sinner or 
performs his upanayana for teaching him the sacred Gayatrl 
and the Veda or if he enters into a matrimonial alliance with 
him. ParasaTa ( L 25-26 ) states that in the Krta age a person 
became patita by speaking with a patita, in Treta by seeing him, 
in Dvapara by partaking of food prepared in his house, but in 
Kali by actually committing a ( sinful ) deed and that when a 
grave sin was committed by a man, in the Kita age the whole 
district in which he lived was to be abandoned, in Treta the 
village, in Dvapara his family alone and in Kali only the 
perpetrator. 1826 Parasara { XIL 79 ) no doubt 1827 says that ' sins 
( i. e pollutions are caused ) are transferred, as a drop of oil 
( spreads ) on water, by sitting or sleeping together or by using 
the same conveyance, by speaking with or by dining in the same 
row with a sinner '; but this only means that to associate with a 
sinner is bad, but it does not mean that to associate with & patita 
immediately makes the associator himself a patita. The Mit. on 
Yaj HL 261 quotes Devala 1825 and Vrddha-Brhaspati to the effect 

1825. «=k«\°i irafa iu&«t y<jii*«. i qM^tvynwiiitara g ^wiwhtst-

make similar remarks. The Udvahatattva says that Parasara 
135 is to be interpreted in this way that merely speaking or 
touching a pofefa or receiving money from him does not make 
another liable to any prayascitta, but that if the association 
with a patita goes quite beyond these, then sin may be incurred 
by association. So almost all the digests are agreed that the 
rigour of the very Btrict rules about samBaTga in Marai and 
Band, was modified by declaring that speech with or Bight of a 
sinner involved no sin in Kali.^ 

21. 'Undergoing (secret) expiation foT the grave sins 
(mahapatakas) except theft ' (1. 15). Harlta ( q by Par. M. H m 
part 2, p 153 ) prescribes secret expiation for a bTahmaua who 
has studied dharmasastra and committed a sin without anyone 
knowing it. Gaut. ( chap. 24 ) prescribes certain expiations to be 
undergone secretly ( without any third person knowing of such 
performance ) for even mahapatakas such as brahmana rmrrdeT, 
drinking sur5, incest and theft of gold. Vas. (chap. 25) also does 
the same and states ( 25. 2 ) that only those who have kept the 
sacred vedic fires, who are disciplined and old or learned are 
entitled to secret expiations for sins and not other people The 
Yisnu Dh. S. 55 deals with secret expiations. Parasara IX. 61

declare one's sin. The Kalivarjya text provides that secret expia- 
tion is allowed as regards only theft among the mahapatakas in 
the Kali age, though in earlier ages it was allowed as to other 
mahapatakas also The Nimayasindhu says that secret expia- 
tion is allowed only to brahmanas According to the Dharma- 
sindhu, in the Kali age if a man is guilty of the murder of a 
brahmaua or of other mahapatakas he does not avoid the conse- 
quences of falling into Hell when he undergoes an expiation but 
he becomes only fit for social intercourse, while as regards theft 
of gold ( a mahapataka ) by undergoing prayascitta he avoids 
the fall into hell and also becomes fit for social intercourse. 
The Kalivarjyavinirnaya appears to hold that all secret expia- 
tions are forbidden in Kali. 1833 

22. 'The act of offering an animal with the recital of 
Vedic manl i as to the bridegroom, to a guest and in honour of 
pitrs'd 16) lBM Madhuparka was offered in ancient times on 
several occasions and to several persons such as to rinks at sacri- 
fices, to the king, to a snataka, to one's acarya, father-in-law, 
paternal or maternal uncle and to a bridegroom. Vide H. of Dh. 
vol. H. pp 542-546 for details about Madhuparka. Originally a 
cow or a bull was killed for an honoured guest, later on when the 
cow came to be extremely sacred the flesh of some other animal 
was offered; when flesh-eating itself came to be looked down upon 
then only payasa and other vegetarian eatables came to be 
prescribed Vide H of Dh vol. H pp. 777-782 on flesh-eating. 
This half line forbids the offering of flesh to a bridegroom or to 
an honoured guest (in madhuparka) and the feeding of

brahmanas with flesh at sraddhas. Comparatively so late a 
miter as Taj (I 258-259 ) extols the high gratiBcation that the 
Mattes feel when flesh of various animals is offered in sraddhas. 
This one prohibition includes in itself several prohibitions that 
are separately mentioned in other texts such aB 'govadha' { in 
notes 1797 and 1799), the killing of an animal in a Madhuparka 
(in n. 1798), 'gavalarabha' and 'palapaitrka* { in note 1802). It is 
noteworthy that even so late as the first half of the 17th century 
Visvanatha, a great logician, takes up the cudgels on behalf of 
flesh-eating by brahmanas in sacrifices, sraddha, madhuparka, 
in danger to life and when ordered by a brahmana and charges 
those who totally forbid flesh-eating with being the followers of 
the doctrines of Bauddhas, while the latter at the same time 
prescribe expiations for even murderers of brahmanas through 
greed of money and marry their maternal uncle's daughters 
or other sapindaB of their mother, though both of these latter 
are t forbidden by the KaliVarjya texts. ls3s 

23, 'Association with those that are guilty of intercourse 
with women who are not of the same varna, even though the 
former may have undergone proper expiation for the lapse* 
<1. 18). There was great divergence of views as regards the 
pr&yascitta for adultery by a male with a female of the same 
class, of a higher class or of a lower class Further the ancient 
sfitras were rather hard on the guilty parties, the harsh rules 
being relaxed by later smrti writers. For example, Gaut 23 
14-15 and Vas. 81. 1-3 prescribe for a male of a lower caste 
having intercourse with a woman of a higher caste death in 
various ways. If a brahmana had sexual intercourse with a 
csndala or svapaka woman Parasara (X. 5-7) prescribes that he 
has to undergo a fast for three days, tonsure of the head together 
with the top knot, three Prajapatyas, Brahmakurca, feeding 
brahmanas, constant recital of the Gayatri, gift of two pairs of 
cows and then he becomes pure, while a sudra doing the same had 
to undergo the expiation of one PrSjapatya and had to mafce a 



1835 nm^^^^^^^^^I^S- 






jjjj Kaliixajyu ' 94i 

gift of two cows. If a person of a low caste lias intercourse with 
a woman of a higher caste ( e g. a sudra has intercourse with a 
brahmana woman) Samvarta ( verses 166-167 ) prescribes the 
expiation of subsisting for a month on cow's urine and yaoaha 
(barley gruel) for him If a brahmana commits adultery with a 
sudra or candala woman Samvarta (verses 169-170) prescribes the 
expiation of candrayana, while Parasara (X. 17-20) prescribes a far 
more severe expiation The present text prescribes that, even after 
undergoing expiation, men guilty of intercourse with women of 
castes other than their own cannot be allowed to have social 
intercourse with their oastemen. The Dharmasindhu 1836 says 
that siidras that have intercourse with brahmana or other women 
of a higher caste are hereby deolared to be unfit for social inter- 
course even after they undergo expiation. This no doubt made 
for strictness in morals, but it also led to the preservation of 
caste exclusivenesB. 

24. ' Abandonment of a mother (or other woman who is to 
be honoured owing to relationship ) because she has had sexual 
intercourse with one of low class' (1. 19 ). 

The provisions of the Butras and smrtis on the subject of 
expiation for adultery by women varied from time to time. 
Gaut 23. 14 and Manu VBL 371 prescribe that a woman who 
has intercourse with a man of low caBte is to be punished by the 
king with being devoured by dogs. But other smrtis and Manu 
himself (XL 177) are not so harsh, but are rather humane in 
their treatment of adulteresses. Manu XI. 176 says that the 
husband should keep confined to one apartment his corrupt wife 
and compel her to perform the expiation which is prescribed for 
males in cases of adultery. Manu XI. 59 and Ya;j HL 235 
regard adultery by a male (paradarya ) as an upapataka and 
Manu XL 117 and Yaj. HI. 265 prescribe candrayana as an 
expiation for all upapatakas. Vas. XXL 12 prescribes that the 
wives of men of the three higher castes who are guilty of 
adultery with a s&dra may be purified by an expiation if no 
child is born of the intercourse but not otherwise Yaj L 72 
provides that a woman becomes free from the taint of adultery 
when she has her monthly illness after the adultery but if she 
conceives in adulterous intercourse she may be abandoned. 
The Mit. on Yaj. L 72 states that both Yaj. and Vas. are to be 

1836. flurc^frtitfi'tT SBrri ^trCwr xi<ji*i£i1i $m( l^l^S i mf- 



948 History of Dharmatastra JVoL 

understood in the same sense and abandonment does not mean 
driving out of the house but only not allowing her to participate 
in religious acts and not having sexual intercourse with her. Vas. 
XXI. 10 states that only four kinds of women are to be abandon- 
ed, viz. one who has intercourse with the husband's pupil or with 
the husband's guru, one who attempts to kill her husband or 
one who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste. YSj. 
( HI. 296-7 ) provides that to women that are patita the same 
rules apply as to men, but they should be given food, raiment 
and protection and that intercourse with a man of low caste is 
one of the three gravest sins for women. Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 
297. The present text states that a woman ( such as a mother ) 
who is entitled to honour from a person because of her relation- 
ship ( as mother, elder sister etc. ) is not to be abandoned and 
cast on the street by him, although she may be guilty of 
adultery with a degraded or low caste man, in spite of Vas. 
XXL 10 and other texts (such as Br.). 1837 That is, this text 
was more humane to such women than ancient texts. Krsna- 
bhatta explains that ' gurustriyah ' means* of a brshmana 
woman '. Vide H. of Dh. vol U pp. 571-573 to tatt" Temaibi 
on adulterous women. &p. Dh. S. 1 10. ZS. 9 requires the son 
always to serve and wait upon the mother even though she may 
bawt&fe. Atri 1 ® 8 (195-196) and Devala (50-51) contain two 
verses ( almost in the same words ) which are lax as compared 
with other ancient texts. They say: 'If a ™man conceives 
through intercourse with a male who is not of her caste she 
becomes impure till her delivery. When she is «« 
she has her monthly illness after the intercourse ishe becomes 

becomes purified by that illness'. This compared laxity of

HI ] Kalivarjya 949 

the later smrtis of Devala and Atri is remedied by this Kali- 
varjya text which forbids abandonment of only such women as 
the mother, but allows the abandonment of others when guilty 
of intercourse with a male of low oaBte. Devala prescribes 
expiation by sanfapana in the case of those women that are 
raped by mlecchas and conceive ( verses 47-49 ) Vide also 
Atri 201-303 The Sm Kau restricts this half verse to the 
mother alone. Farasara ( X 24-25 ) prescribes that if a woman 
be raped once she becomes free from pollution by undergoing 
Prajapatya after she has her monthly illness and in other cases 
of rape she has to undergo Santapana. 

25. ' Sacrificing one's life for the sake of another ' ( 1. 20 ). 
The Visnu Dh. S IIL 45 states 1839 that -those who are killed in 
saving the life of a cow, a brahmana, the king, a friend, one's 
wealth and one's wife go to heaven and XVI. 18 provides that

varnas ) and sacrifice their life for brahmanas, for cows and for 
women and children attain heaven The Adityapurana quoted 
in Rajadharmakanda ( p. 91 ) has a similar veTse. The Samaya- 
mayukha and Bhattoji quote a smrti, ' one should at once sacri- 
fice one's life for cows and brahmanas '. 18W This text forbids 
self-sacrifice of one's life simply for the promised reward of 
heaven in the cases specified. The K. V.N. (folio 9b) offers 
two more ( rather far-fetched } explanations of this phrase, one of 
which is ' offering one's services as a serf to another'. This is 
prohibited to members of the three twice-born classes in Kali, 
but not to the sudras, ace to K. V. N.

and curds and was to give the remainder to a brahmana (or a 
eon or a younger brother) This is prohibited by this Kalivarjya 
text Vide H. of Db. vol. IL p. 544 for this practice. 5p Dh. 
S. ( I 1. 4. 1-6 ) provides that the pupil may partake of the 
leavings of his teacher's food, but the teacher should not give 
him honey or meat or other food which will be opposed to the 
observances of a vedic student The Nirnayasmdhu reads 
'uddistasyapi varjanam' 1841 , which means 'not accepting what 
has been donated.' Yaj. I 213 says that if a person worthy of 
accepting a gift does not keep it for himself (but passes it on to 
others ), he secures the highest worlds obtained by those who 
make generous gifts Bhattoji gives another explanation Vas 
( 14. 21 ) forbids a man to eat the remnants of his own food or to 
eat food that comes in contact with the leavings of food. This 
Kalivarjya text sets aside for the Kali age the prohibition con- 
tamed in Vas. 14. 21 (aco to Bhattoji) The J.TH.I folio 10 
a) states that this is the explanation given by some, but does 
not approve of it. The Sm Kan. gives yet another but extremely 
far-fetched explanation. ua These several explanations of the 
same half verse indicate how some of the Kalivarjya texts are 
comparatively recent and have no settled meaning even accord- 
ing to comparatively late writers of digests. 

27. 'The resolve to offer worship (throughout life) with 
various details to a certain idol ( 1. 21 ) 

It is not easy to see why such a resolve should have been 
prohibited. Therefore this explanation given by Bhattoji, *-. v . 
N. (folio 10 a), the SamayamayQkha and others is «*»*»£ 
tory It is better to accept the explanation of the JVir S. that 
this forbids the undertaking of the worship of a P"*J«^r£

to officiate at sraddhas. 1843 Mann HI. 152 declares the devalaka 
to be unfit for being invited for sraddhas or rites in honour of 
gods and Kulluka quotes Devala to the effect that one who 
maintains himself on the treasury- of a shrine is called devalaka. 
It is remarkable that Vrddha-Harlta (VIIL 77-80) says that only 
the worshippers of Siva for wages are called devalaka and those 
of Visnu are not. Aco. to the Sm. Kau. what is forbidden is the 
resolve to worship an image for securing a direct vision of the 
Deity. 1814 This is rather pedantic and far-fetched. 

28. ' Touching the bodies of those ( who are impure on the 
death of a relative ) after the collection of the bones ' (1 22 ). 
The day on which the bones were to be collected after the body 
was cremated differed greatly according to various writers. The 
Mit. on Taj. HX 17 notes that according to Samvarta 181 ^ 
(verse 38) the bones.may be collected on the first, third, seventh 
or 9th day, that the Visnu Dh. S (19. 10-11) prescribes the 4th 
day for it and recommends the casting of them into the Ganges, 
that some did it on the 2nd day and that therefore everyone should 
follow his own Grhyasutra. The Mit. on Yaj. HL 18 quotes 
Devala to the effect that, after the lapse of one-third of the period 
of impurity prescribed for members of the four varnas (as in Yaj. 
HL 22 ), persons who lost relatives become touohable, that 
members of the four varnas become touchable in three, four, 
five and ten days respectively. Samvarta (verses 39-40) 
states that, after the collection of bones, touching those who 
are under pollution due to death is allowed on the 4th, 6th, 8th 
and 10th day respectively in the case of brahmanas, ksatriyas, 
Vaisyas and sudras. The present KaHvarjya text f orbidB this 
and becomes stricter as to the rules about impurity.

The animal in a srauta sacrifice was to be killed by choking 
it and strangling it. The person who did so was called samitr 
Different views were entertained as to who was to be the samite 
Ace. to Jai. IE. 7. 28-29 18 « the adhvaryu himself was to be the 
samitr ; the usual opinion was that he was to be some one other 
than the Hoiks. The As v. Sr. (XEE. 9.12-13) shows that he 
may be a brahmana or a non-brahmana. for further details 
vide H. of Dh. vol. IL pp 1121-22, n. 2504. As animal sacrifices 
themselves came to be looked down upon or even forbidden, this 
text forbids a brahmana from being a samitr. 

30. ' The sale of the soma plant by brahmanas ' ( 1. 23 ). 

Soma beverage was to be drunk only by brahmanas. The soma 
plant had to be purchased and there was a symbolic haggling for it. 
The vendor of soma in ancient 1847 timeswas,acc.toKat. Sr. VH.6. 
2-4 and Ap Sr . X 20. 12, either a brShmana of Eutsa gotra or any 
brahmana or a sudra, 1817 In later times, though Manu XL 7 { = 
Santil65. 7 ) and Nar. ( dattapradanika 7 ) 1MB allow a brahmana 
who has wealth sufficient for the maintenance of himself and has 
dependents for three years or more to perform a soma sacrifice, 
yet Manu HI. 158, Yaj 1 165 and Vas 14. 3 hold that a brahmana 
who sells the soma plant is unfit to be invited at a sraddha and 
that one should not partake of food at his house. Manu X 88 
forbids a brahmana to sell water, arms, poison, soma &c Vide 
H. of Dh. vol. H. pp 1141-1143 for purchase of soma and the 
dramatic haggling for it. 

31. ' Allowing a brahmana householder to eat food at the 
houses' of four classes of people among sudras viz his slave, 
his cowherd, a hereditary family friend and one who titivates 
his fields on the basis of paying a half or other portion of tUe 
produce to him" ( 11. 25-26 ).

food of these four and of hfe own barber. Haradatta on Gaut. 
17. 6 and Apararka ( p. 244 ) remark that a brahmana can take 
the food of these peiBons among sudras only in the event of 
extreme calamities. Sxom this it appears that up to the 12th. 
century A. D. the peremptory prohibition contained in this text 
was either unknown or was not much respected. The exclusive- 
ness of caste in matters of food and marriage was made more 
strict by the Kalivarjya texts. Vide above ( pp. 869 and 885 ) as 
to how Parasara hunBelf was overruled by this text. 

32. ' Pilgrimages to very distant holy places ' ( 1. 26 ). 

A brahmana was called upon to tend his Vedic or grhya 
fires. If he went to distant places on pilgrimage this duty 
would be interfered with. It is provided by Ap. 18S0 Sr. IV 16._ 18 
that even when on a journey the agmhotnn has, after turning 
his face in the direction of his fire altar, to go mentally over 
the whole procedure of his daily fire worship and the Darsa- 
puinamSsa. The Gobhila-smrti IL 157 says the same. The 
Smrtikaustubha 1851 says that this prohibits pilgrimage to holy 
places beyond the sea or on tbe borders of Bbaratavarsa, This 
text prohibits a brahmana from going to distant places on 
pilgrimage, but it does not prevent him from undertaking a 
journey for earning wealth for performing sacrifices. K. V. ST. 
(folio 10a ) quotes a text of Satyavrata to this effect. 

33. 'The rule that a pupil should habitually observe the 
same behaviour towards the wife of the guru, as towards the 
guru himself ' (1. 37 ). Ap. Dh. 18a S. 1 2. 7. 27, Gaut. IL 31-34, 
ManuII. 2L0, Vismi Dh. S. 33. 1-2 prescribe that a student 
should perform the same acts of honour and obedience towards 
the wife or wives of his teacher as towards the teacher ( except 
holding her feet in doing obeisance and eating the leavings of 
the food). As students were often grown-up young men and 
the teacher's wife might often be a young lady, Manu H. 212,

954 History of Dharma&astra [Vol. 

216, 217 ( that are the same as Visnu Dh. S. 32. 13-15 ) provide 
that a pupil full twenty years old should not show honour to 2 
young wife of his teacher by clasping her feet, but that he may 
prostrate himself on the ground before the teacher's young wife 
in performing obeisance and that he may hold her feet in 
obeisance only (once) when he returns from a journey. This text 
accepts the principle underlying the special rules laid down by 
Manu and Visnu and prohibits the daily touching of the feet of 
the guru's wife on the part of the pupil. The Sm 18B Kau. and 
Dharmasindhu ( HI p. 35S ) hold that thiB sets aside the rule laid 
down in Yaj I 49 that a perpetual student may stay till his 
death with his teacher or with the teacher's son or ( in default 
of both ) with the teacher's wife. 

34. 'The modes of maintenance conceded to brahmanas in 
times of distress (or calamity)' (1. 28), 

The special modes of maintenance prescribed for brali- 
manas were receiving gifts, teaching the Yeda and officiating 
as priests (Gaut. X 2, £p. Dh. S, H, 5. 10. 5, Manu X 76, 1 88, 
Vas. H. 14, Yaj. I. 118). But it was recognised from very 
ancient times that if a brahmana could not maintain himself 
by following the above modes of earning wealth be could in a 
season of distress pursue the avocations peculiar to a ksatriya 
or vaisya (Gaut. VDT. 6-7, Baud. Dh. S. H. 2. 77-81, Vas IL 22, 
Manu X. 81-82, Yaj. HI 35 ) 18St . Vide H. of Dh vol. IL pp. 118- 
133 for detailed treatment of this matter and for the restric- 
tions imposed even when brahmanas were allowed to follow the 
avocations of kaatriyas and vaisyas. The Kalivarjya prohibi- 
tion is merely one on paper. From anoient times till now 
brahmanas have pursued all sorts of avocations and hardly any 
importance has been attached to this dictum. 

35. 'Not accumulating any wealth (or grains) for the 
morrow ' ( 1. 28 ). Manu IV. 7 and Yaj. 1. 128 provide that brah- 
manas are of four kinds, viz. those who accumulate grain of 
the capacity of a kusiila, those who accumulate grain of the capa- 
city of a kumbht, those that accumulate grain enough to satisfy

their needs for three days and those who do not collect grain 
even for the next day. The smrtis prescribe that each later 
one is superior in merit to each preceding one. The commen- 
tators differ as to the meaning conveyed hy kusuladhanya 
( some holding that it means one who has accumulated grain 
for three years, while others say it means one who has grain for 
12 days) and kumbhldhanya (a person accumulating grain for a 
year, or grain for six days). Vide H. of Do.- vol. H. p. 110, note 
234 and p. 641 note 1502. The Mit. on Yaj. L 128 says that the 
advice not to accumulate corn even for three days or one day is 
not addressed to all brahmanas, but to those only who are called 
ysyavara 1855 . This explanation of the Mit. indicates that the 
Kalivarjya text on this point was either not known to the Mit. 
or was not much thought of hy it. The Kalivarjya text provides 
that the ideal of extreme poverty and absence of acquisitiveness 
for brahmanas was not to he insisted upon in the Kali age. 

36. ' The acceptance of the kindling of a log of wood ( L e. 
setting up sacred Vedio fire) at the time of the homa of Jatakarma 
for the purpose of securing long life to the child horn to a 
person* (1. 29 ). The aravis are two logs of Asvattha tree from 
which fire is produced by attrition, which ( fire ) is used for 
kindling the garhapatya fire. In certain sakhas, it is the prac- 
tice to kindle fire from aranis and to use it for the homa in the 
Jfitakarma rite. This fire was to be used in the subsequent 
rites for the child such as cuds, upanayana, marriage. It was 
supposed that this enabled the child to live long." 56 The Sam 
K quotes a parisista text to this effect. 1857 

37. 'Constant journeyB by brahmanas' ('l. 30). The 
Mahabharata ( Santi 23. 15 ) 18S8 says, 'As a snake swallows mice 
hiding in holes, the earth swallows two persons viz. a king who 
does not fight (an invader) and a brshmana who does not engage

text; only forbids taking aimlessly to long journeys but not 
those for study or for religious purposes. 

38. 'Blowing on fire with the mouth' in order to kindle 
it into flames (I 30). Gaut. IX. 32, Manu 17, S3 and 
BrahmapurSna 221. 102 forbid the blowing on fire with the 
mouth (aB in doing so it is likely that drops of saliva from the 
mouth may fall into the fire and pollute it ). Haradafcta on Ap. 
Dh. S. I 5. 15. 20 notices that in fee V&jasaneya Sskhs it is said 
that fira should he kindled into flames by blowing upon it with 
the breath from the mouth since it Bprang from the mouth of the 
Creator (as stated in the Porusasukta, &g. X 90. 13). Therefore, 
ace. to Haradata and the Gobhila-smrti (1. 135-136) 1859 the irauta 
fire could he kindled by blowing upon it with the mouth, but 
smarto fire or ordinary fire should not he kindled in that way 
(but only by using a fan or a bamboo cylindrical piece). 
The Kalivarjya text forbids blowing with the mouth even on 
srauta fire. 

39, 'Allowing social intercourse to women who have 
become polluted by rape and the like (when they have performed 
prayascitta) as prescribed in the sastras' (1. 31}. 18M Vas. 28. 2-3 
state/ when a wom'an is polluted by being raped or kidnapp- 
ed by a thief, she should not be abandoned; one should wait 
till her monthly illness (making her undergo certain expiations 
till then) and she becomes pure after it.' Atri ( V. 2-3 ) has the 
same verses, which are quoted (from Vas.) by Visvarupa on 
Yaj HL 256 (p 133. Tri. ed. ) and explained at great lengta. 
The Matsyaparana 227. 126 is liberal enough to say that the 
man who commits rape should be punished with deatt t but the 
woman raped incurs no blame. Parasara ( X. 27 ) provides that 
ffTwoman is raped by an evil-doer only once she becomes pure

But this text is haTsher on such, innocent and unlucky women 
when it says that they cannot he restored to social intercourse 
even after undergoing expiation. 

40. ' Begging of food by a sannyasm from members of all 
varnas ( including sudras ) according to the rules of the saBtra ' 
(1.32). The Sm, M. p. SOI (on varnasrama) quotes Kathaka 
Brahmana, 18 * 1 Aruni Up., Parasara ( in prose ) to the effect that 
a yah may beg for food from members of all varnas. Baud. Dh. 
S. 3X 10 69 18S2 also quotes a verse which allows the begging of 
food from all varnas to a yah. Vas. X. 7 requires a yati to beg 
at seven houses not selected beforehand and in X. 24 states that 
he should subsist on what food he gets at the houses of 
biaamanas. 1863 The present text requires even the yati to observe 
caste rules as to food. 

41. * Not using for ten days fresh rain water ' ( 1. 33 ). 
Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. L 5. 15. 2, Bhattoji on Catur. (p. 54), Sm. 
Kau. p. 479 quote a verse, ' she-goats, cows, she-buffaloes and 
brahmana women become free from impurity ( due to delivery ) 
after ten nights and so does fresh rain water accumulated on the 
ground '. According to this the long period of ten days in the 
case of rain water is set aside. But Bhattoji notes that accord- 
ing to another smrti * rain water falling at the proper season 
is pure, but it is not to be used for drinking for three days ; 
when rain falls at an unusual season rain water is impure for 
ten days and if a man drinks it within that period he should 
abstain from food for one day and night '. Bhattoji remarks 
that the Kalivarjya text only sets aside waiting for ten days, 
but does not set aside the rule against drinking it for three days.

958 History of Dharmaiastra 



[Vol. 



The ancient practice was to make no agreement as to fees 
for teaching. Vide Br. Up. IV. 1. 2. Gaut. (H 54-55) prescribes""* 
that at the end of his studies the student should request the 
teacher to accept the wealth that he could offer or ask the 
teacher what should be given and after paying or doing what 
was required by the guru, or if the teacher permitted him to go 
without demanding anything the student should take the 
ceremonial bath. Vide Manu IL 245-246 and H. of Dh. vol. JL 
pp. 360-361 for details. Taj. I 51 provides that at the end of 
his studies the Btudent may give to the teacher what he desires 
( or a cow ) according to his ability or may with his permission 
take the ceremonial bath (without paying anything). On 
account of these provisions we have stories in the ancient litera- 
ture that very rarely teachers or their wives made fanciful 
demands. This Kalivarjya text only sets aside the require- 
ment of paying what the guru demands, hut does not prohibit 
the voluntary gift of a fee by the student. 1866 

43. * The engagement of a sudra for such acts as cooking 
and the like in the houses of brahmanas and the rest' (1. 34). 
Ap. Dh. S. (H. 2. 3 1-8 ) requires that 1867 the food for Vaisva- 
deva should be prepared by pure men of the first three varnas 
and also optionally allows a sudra to be a cook for an arm pro- 
vided he is under the supervision of men of the first three 
varnas, provided he sips water whenever he touches the hair, 
any limb or his garment, provided he cuts the hair ( on his head 
and his body), the beard and nails every day or every 8th day of 
the month or on the new and full moon day and provided he 
bathes with the clothes on. It is this permission that is set 
aside by this Kalivarjya text. 

44. ' Suicide of very old people by falling into fire or from 
a precipice ' ( 1. 35 ). 

This is analogous to Ho. 13 above. Atri did not condemn 
s uicide in certain cases. He states, 1868 (verses 218-219) if one be

old (beyond 70), if one cannot observe tbe rules of bodily puri- 
fication (owing to extreme weakness), if one is so ill that all 
medical help is discarded, and if one in these circumstances 
kills himself by throwing himself from a precipice or into fire 
or water or by fasting, mourning should be observed for him 
for three days and sraddha may be performed for him.' Apar- 
arka (p. 536 ) quotes several smrtis to the effect that a very old 
man or one suffering from very serious illness, one who has no 
desires left and has carried out his tasks may bring about his 
death by entering fire or water or falling from a precipice and 
he will incur no Bin. Vide H. of Dh. vol. H. pp. 986-92? for 
further details. This text may also be taken as forbidding 
suicide by falling from a precipice or into fire as an expiation 
in the caBe of those that are guilty of mahapatakas knowingly 
committed. The Mit. on Yaj. HL 236 quotes a smrti to this 
effect 1 * 9 The Suddhitattva holds (pp. 284-285) that suicide 
by entering water and the like is allowed in Kali only to 
sudras and forbidden to brahmanas and others. 

45. 'The performance of acamana (purificatory sipping of 
water) by sistas in as much water as is sufficient for slaking 
the thirst of a cow' (1. 36). 

Manu V. 128, Vas. m. 35, Baud. Dh. S. L 5. 65, Yaj. L 192, 
Vianu 23. 43 provide lsro that water collected on the ground iB 
pure (and may be used for acamana) provided it is sufficient 
in quantity to slake the thirst of a cow. But this text forbids 
on hygienic grounds the use of small quantities of water collec- 
ted on the ground for sipping and similar purposes. 

46. 'The residence of an ascetic in the house near which 
he happens to be in the evening' ( 1. 38 ). 

Aco. to Ap. Dh. S. H. 9. 21. 10 and Manu VI. 43, 55-56, an 
ascetic was to kindle no fire, was to be houseless and was to 
beg only once a day in the afternoon or evening when no smoke 
ascends from the kitchens of people, when the embers have been 
extinguished, when people have finished their meals &c. Vas. (X-

12-15) provides 1871 that a samyasm was to change his residence 
frequently, was to stay at the hotmdary of the village or in a 
temple, or in an empty house or at the bottom of a tree and 
should constantly live in a forest. Sankha (VII- 6) states that an 
ascetic should stay in an empty house or he may stay wherever 
he may he when the sun sets. This provision of Sankha 
is set aside by the Kalivarjya test Another meaning of 
the words, according to Krsnabhatta on the Nir. S. (p. 1310), is 
that this runs counter to the recommendation of Manu "VI. 56 
that an ascetic should go for begging to the houses in a village 
in the evening when all smoke from kitchens has ceased i e, 
by this text he is allowed to beg in the noon. In a way this 
appears to be a better explanation. 

The above is a complete list of all Zalivarjyas quoted from 
the AdityapurSna (except one or two). Some of the Kalivarjyas 
not included here, but included in other texts cited above will 
also be now set out for the sake of completeness of treatment 

47. 'Resorting to sanrasrosa'. Vyasa quoted above ( n. 1793) 
forbade sannySsa in the Kali age after 4400 years of it had 
elapsed, but then Devala 1872 made an exception to this extent 
that as long as the division of society into four varnas existed 
and as long as the Veda was studied sannyasa could be resorted 
to even in Kali The Sir. S. explains that what is forbidden is 
the sannyasa with three dandas and riot the sannyasa with one 
danda. Baud IL 10. 53 ( ekadandi va ) gives an optaon that a 
sannyasin may carry three stafe or one, while Yaj EL 58 speaks 
of a S as only tridandL Danda meas a staff and also 'restraint

the spiritual restraint in him (v. 29) In L 13-13 Daksa says that 
just as a girdle, deer skin and a wooden staff are the outward 
signs of a vedic student, so three staffs are the peculiar sign of a 
yati. Vide H. of Dh vol H. pp. 937-938 for further details. H the 
Kalivarjya text were meant to forbid sannyasa altogether, it 
must be said that it was never honoured and even now thousands 
become sannyaBins every year. If, as the Nir. S. says, this text 
only forbids the carrying of three dandas, it is a meaningless 
prohibition, giving importance only to outward symbols and 
not to the substance of the matter. 

48. 'The observance of agntftoim' or ' the acceptance of 
three fires'. Vyasa ( n. 1793 ) forbade the performance of srauta 
agmhoira along with sannyasa in Kali, but an exception was 
made by Devala in favour of its observance as also of resort 
to sannyasa on the grounds stated above (in No. 47). Some 
digests and authors such as the Nirnayasindhu 1874 and Bhatty>ji 
explain that agnihotra of the sarvadhana type is forbidden in 
Kali, but that of the ardhadhana type is allowed. Agnihotra 
means 'adhuna\ that is, setting up of the srauta fires. When a 
man consecrates the three srauta fires he may do so with half of 
his smarfca fire and keep up the other half of the smarta fire. This 
is called cadhUdhana. If he does not keep the smarta fire 
separate, it is sa> oudlwtna Laugaksi quoted by the Nir. S. ( HL 
p. 370 ), Bhattoji and others states this. The Mit. on Ya]. HI. 45 
mentions these two modes Therefore, according to these explana- 
tions, sarvadhana was allowed in former ages ( and ace. to one 
interpretation up to 4400 years of Kali ), while in Kali ( or at 
least after 4400 years of Kali) only ardhadhana is allowea 

49. 'Human sacrifice* (vide note 1798 giving extract from 
Naradapurana ). 

The Tai. Br.^s (m, 4 ;i_ 19 ) oontains a ,3 eBCri p tion of the 
procedure of human sacrifice. The oldest texts even do not show 
that a human being was killed. The whole procedure is

symbolical. The Vfij. S., (XXX. 5 ft ) has many passages in 
common with the Tai. Br. The Tai. Br. BX 4. 1 ( = Vaj. S. 30. 5 ) 
begins, ' the brahmana should be offered to brahman ( spiritual 
power ), the fcsatriya to ksatra ( military power), the vaisya to 
the Maruts' &c. Aoo. to Up. Sr. XX. 24, a brahmana or ksatriya 
performs this saorifiee, whereby he attains power and valour 
and all prosperity. There are eleven sacrificial posts and eleven 
animals to be offered to Agni and Soma. After the rite of 
paryagmltarana is performed on the brahmana and others, they 
are presented to the several deities and then discharged from 
the sacrificial posts, eleven goats are killed and oblations of 
their flesh and limbs are offered. Ace. to the com. on V&j. S., 
it is begun on the 10th day of the bright half of Oaitra and goes 
on for 40 days, which are occupied with 23 dlksas, IZ upasads 
and five suiyas (days on which soma is extracted). After 
this yaga, the yajamana usually resorted to a forest aB a 
sannyasin. 1876 

50. * Asvamedha ' ( n. 1798 ). The Tai. S. V. 3. 12. 2 states,"" 
'he who performs the Asvamedha becomes free from (the sin of) 
brahmana murder V In spite of this Vedic authority the Brhan- 
Nfiradlya and other puranas prohibited it. But no one heeded 
this prohibition and numerous hiBtoxio kings performed this 
sacrifice from at least ZOO B.C. to Jayasing in the 18*h cMrtaxy

Harita, Daksa 1878 (17) and others mention these two varie- 
ties, while Ysj. I 49, Vedavyasa L 41 and Visnu 3>h. S. 28. 46 
name and describe the vcasthika, Manu B. 243-244, Yaj. I. 
49-50, Vas. VIL 4-5 provide that a perpetual Vedio student 
should stay with his teacher till his own death, that on 
the teacher's death he should stay with the teacher's son 
or the teacher's wife or should tend fire, that if he curbs 
his senseB till his death, he reaches the world of brahma 
(immortality) and is not born again. This was a very diffi- 
cult mode of life, there were great temptations as the fleBh 
is weak and therefore the Brhan-Naradlya and others prohibited 
perpetual studenthood. Some works such as the Madanaparijata 
(p. 16), the Kalivarjyavinirnaya of Damodara, and the Nir. S. 
read 'dirgha-kalam brahmaoaryam ' in place of 'naisthikam 
brahmacaryam ' in the Brhan-Naradlva. 

53. * Brahmacarya for long periods ' ( n. 1799 ). The Baud. 
Dh.S. (L2.1-5) declares, "the term of studentship for Veda study 
as observed in ancient timeB lasted for 48 years, or 24 years, or 
12 years for each Veda or at least one year for each kanfa ( of 
the Tai.S.) or it lasted till the Veda was committed to memory, 
as life is evanescent and as the Veda ordainB * let him kindle 
the sacred fires while bis hair is still blaok'. " The Xp. Dh. S. 
(1.1 2. 11-16) provides that the student's stay with the 
teacher's household should be 48 years, 24 years or 12 years at 
the lowest. Manu BL 1 also stateB that the vow of studying 
the three Vedas under a guru must be observed for 36 years or 
for half of that time or for a quarter of it or until the student 
has mastered (the Veda). These long periods of 48 years, 36 or 
24 years for Veda study (before a man could become an house- 
holder ) are here forbidden in Kali. This was nothing new. Yaj. 
J. 36 had allowed 12 years for each Veda or five and if a man 
did not want to study all vedas but only one he could finish Mb 
studenthood in five years. Only an extremely small number 
could have spent 48 or 36 yeare in Veda study. Sahara on Jai. 
1. 3. 3 held that this text of Baud, was opposed to the indt about 
kindling fires when a man was a young householder with black 
hair and was to be discarded. Vide pp. 832-834 above for a

aimed at the words of &p. and Baud, and that the vow of 
perpetual studentship which was undertaken with a special 
purpose in view ( viz. realization of brahrna and non-return 
to scuhsara) was not prohibited by the Kalivarjya text and that 
there was nothing wrong in the practice of perpetual student- 
hood among the Dravidas. 

- 54. 'Animal sacrifice.* In the Markandeya as quoted in 
Aparaxka p. 929 above animal sacrifice was forbidden in the Kali 
age. Though popular feeling had gradually veered round to the 
view that meat should not bB offered in sraddhas, in madhuparka 
(No. %% above), yet animal sacrifices were performed at all 
times and are even now performed, though very rarely. 

55. 'Intoxicating drinks (madya)\ There were startling 
vicissitudes in the attitude to intoxicants. 

In Vedic times soma was a beverage drunk by the priests 
and sura was a beverage for common men and usually not 
meant to be offered to the godB. Soma and sura are sharply 
distinguished (vide Tai. S. JL 5. 1. 1, Vaj. S. 19. 7, Sat. Br. V. 1. 
5.28). The Sat. Br. (V. 1. 5. 28) has the striking antithesis 
'For, Soma is truth, prosperity, light; and sura is untruth, 
misery, darkness '. Tn the SautramanI isti a biahmana had to 
be hired for drinking the dregs of sutS offered in it and if a 
br&hmana could not be found the sura was poured on an ant- 
hill (Tai. Br. L 8. 6 and Sabara on Jai. BX 5. 14-15 ). It appears 
from the Kathaka-samhita XH. 13 that 1879 brahmanas had by 
that time oome to regard the drinking of sura aB sinful. From 
Chan. Up. V. 10.9 it appears that a drinker of sura was enumerated 
among five grave sinners. In the .Ssv.gr. H. 5.3-5 it is said 
that in the rites of the Anvastaka day when pindas are offered 
to the male ancestors, the female ancestors viz. the mother, the 
paternal grandmother and great-grandmother are °f^f^ 
and the scum of boiled rice in addition"* The Njr.S.(UL

p. 367) refers to this passage of the Isv. Gr. and holds that the 
Kalivarjya text against intoxicants forhids this also. 

Madya is a generic term applicable to all intoxicating 
drinks ; sura is said to he of three kinds, viz that prepared from 
molasseB, that from honey ( or madhuka flowers or from grapes) 
and that from corn flour (Manu XL 94, Visnu Dh. S 22. 82 and 
Samvarta 117 ). The Visnu Dh S. (22. 83-84) specifies ten 
kinds of madya, all of which a brabmana was not even to touch. 
Gaut. IL 25 1 ** 1 , £p. Dh. S. L 5. 17. 21, Manu XL 95 forbid all 
kinds of madya to brahmanas at all stages of life. JLp. L 7. 
21. 8, Vas. L 20, Manu XI 54, Visnu Dh. S. 35. 1 hold that the 
drinking of sura is one of the five grave sins (mahapatakas), 
while Yaj. HL 227 employs the word 'madya' in place of sura 
in this connection. Baud. Dh. S. L 1. 22 however notes that 
among the five practices peculiar to the brahmanas of the north 
was that of drinking rum and Baud, condemns it. The verses 
of Manu XL 93-34 about the three kinds of sura have been the 
subject of frequent and varying interpretations. Visvarfipa on 
Yaj. EEL 222, the Mit on Yaj. HL 253, Apararka p 1069 and 
others establish that the word 'sura' primarily applies to patsti 
( liquor prepared from flour ) alone, that paistl is forbidden to 
all brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas, that it is the drinking 
of paistl alone that constitutes a mahapataka, that all intoxi- 
cating drinks are forbidden to brahmanas in all ages, but in- 
toxicants other than paistl ( such as those prepared from molasses 
or madhuka flowers ) are not forbidden to ksatriyas and vaisyas. 
Manu XI. 93 says that sura is the refuse of cooked food ( rice ) ; 
therefore members of the three higher castes should not drink 
sura. This clearly shows that Manu took sura as meaning 
only paistl ( liquor prepared from rice flour ). The Visnu Dh. 
S. { 22. 84 ) expressly says that ksatriyas and vaisyas are not 
polluted by touching the ten kinds of madyas specified by it. 
In the Udyogaparva (59 5 ) both VSsudeva ( Krsna ) and Arjuna 
are described as intoxicated by drinking the liquor prepared 
from honey and the Tantravartika establishes that there was 
nothing wrong in this as both were ksatriyas. Intoxicants were 
not forbidden to sudras. Brahmacarins of whatever varna had 
to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. Apararka 1682 (p 63)

966 History of Dharmaiaslra [ Vol. 

after quoting the Brahmapurana states that intoxicating drinks 
were forbidden to the three varnas in Eali and to brahmanas 
in all yugas (ages). But this is opposed to tradition. The 
Adiparva ( chap. 76 ) narrates 1883 that SukracSrya prohibited for 
the first time brahmanas from drinking intoxicants (vide H. Dh, 
vol IL pp 792-799 for detailed discussion of this topic ). The 
Kalivarjya text forbids the drinking of intoxicants to all the 
three twice-born classes. But ksatriyas and vaisyas pay soant 
attention to this prohibition and even some brahmanas in these 
days have taken to drink aB a fashionable indulgence The K. 
V. N. (folio 5a), Krsnabhatta 1884 and Sm. Kau. note that in the 
flakta treatises (called Vamagama) madya is allowed to be 
offered to the idol for all the three varnas and to ksatriyas in the 
propitiatory rites for VinSyaka and for birth on the Mfila con- 
stellation but this kalivarjya text forbids all that. 

An analysis of these 55 kalivarjyas yields very interesting 
results. About one-fourth out of the above 55 relate to Srauta 
matters. There are several texts forbidding Agnihotra, 
Asvamedha, Rajasuya, Purusamedha, sattras, Gosava, animal 
sacrifices, while a few others are concerned with matters of 
detail in sacrifices ( vide No. 11, 14-16, 29-30, 38, 48-51, 54) 
The first nine of these 55 are-concerned with legal matters and 
relations. Some prohibitions are due to growing caste exclusive- 
ness ( No 5, 10, 31, 40, 43 ). Others again spring from ideas of 
greater insistence on the sacredness of the marriage tie, a 
stricter morality and a demand for greater dec enoy and party, 
particularly in women (No. 2, 3, 4, 9, 15, 23, 24, 33, 39 ,55). 
A few are based on notions of compassion, justice and equity 
'So 1 8 24 25 42). Some owe their origin to the growing 
sacred fof thetohmana's person and his ^°°«™

piohibit the stage of forest hermit and of sannyasa, strike at the 
very root of the ancient Boheme of asramas. 

The chapter on Kalivarjyas can be employed as a very 
effective answer to those who trot out the theory of the 'unchang- 
ing EaBt\ Social ideas and practices undergo substantial 
changes even in the most static societies. Many of the practic- 
es, that had the authority of the Veda (which was supposed to be 
self-existent and eternal) and of such ancient smrtis as those of 
fip , Manu and Yaj , had either come to be given up or had 
become obnoxious to popular sentiment. This fiction of great 
men meeting together and laying down conventions for the 
Kali age was the method that was hit upon to admit changes in 
religious practices and ideas of morality. The Kalivarjya texts 
are also a complete answer to those who hold fast to the notion 
that dhawna ( particularly acaradharma ) is immutable and un- 
changeable (apanvarlcmlya). This chapter on Kalivarjya 
unmistakably showB how the most authoritative dicta of the 
Veda and of ancient sages and law-givers were set aside and 
held to he of no binding authority because they ran counter to 
prevailing notions and furnishes a powerful weapon in the 
hands of thosB who want to introduce reforms in .the incidents 
of marriage, inheritance and other matters touching modern 
Hindu society. One can further see how some practices still 
persist in spite of the prohibitions in the Kalivarjya texts viz. 
marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter, sannyasa, 
agnihofcra and even srauta animal sacrifices (rarely). 

Some works add two more to the Kalivarjya verses which 
mean, ' imprecations, omens, dreams, palmistry, listening for 
supernatural voices or messages, promises to make presents to 
a deity if a certain prayer were granted, prophetic replies by 
astrologers to questions, may rarely turn out to be true. One should 
not, however, resort to these through the desire to secure results 
from them Similarly there are other actions also (that have to 
be abandoned) in the Kali age, beoause they have come to he 
included (by people) under improper acts (adharma) ' 16S5

968 History of Dkarmaiattra [ Vol. 

From the fact that no ancient smrti speaks of Kalivarjya, 
that the ancient commentaries of Visvarupa, Medhatithi and 
even Vijfianesvara do not cite long lists of KalivarjyaB, that 
such lists first make their appearance in the SmrtyarthaBara, 
the Sm. G. and Hemadri ( works and authors of 12th and 13th 
centuries), the most probable inference is that these lists of 
Kalivarjyas were first put together at the earliest in the 10th or 
11th century A. D. 18B6

CHAPTER XXXV 
CUSTOMS IN MODERN INDIAN IAW 

Though an elaborate treatment of customs in modern 
Anglo-Indian Law is far beyond the Bcope of the p>3sent work, 
yet a few words on customs in modern times may not be 
altogether out of place here "When the British began to acquire 
political domination in India they realized the importance attach, 
ed to customs by all persons in India and the Charter of the 
Mayor's court at Bombay in 1753, unconsciously following the 
ancient dicta of Manu ( VII. 203 ) and Yaj (I. 343), contains the 
earliest trace in British royal charters of a reservation to the 
peoples of India 'of their laws and customs. 1887 The British 
Parliament and the Indian Legislatures have allowed customs 
to occupy a very high place in the administration of law and 
justice. The preamble to 21 Geo. HI chap. 70 ( 1781 A, D. ) 
recited that one of the purposes for which the Act was passed 
was that the inhabitants of Bengal, Bihar and OrisBa Bhould he 
maintained and protected in the enjoyment of all their laws, 
usages, rights and privileges and sec. 17 of that Act provided 
among other things that, in the case of the inhabitants of 
Calcutta, their inheritance and succession to lands, rents and 
goods and all matters of contract and dealing between party 
and party shall be determined in the case of Mahomedans by 
the laws and usages of Mahomedans and in the case of Gentus 
by the laws and usages of Gentus 1888 and, where only one of

The burden of proving a custom opposed to the general 
law or in derogation of the ordinary Tights of another lies 
heavily on the person alleging it."* 9 The decided cases lay 
down several essentials of a valid custom In order to make a 
particular custom valid it must be proved to he immemorial or 
ancient, uniform, certain, reasonable, obligatory and it must 
not be immoral or opposed to public policy or to any express 
enactment of the Legislature. What antiquity must be proicd 
before a custom can he accepted as valid depends upon the 
circumstances of each case tm When it is said that a custom 
must be ancient it is not meant that the antiquity must be 
carried back to a period beyond the memory of man. According 
to the Mit. on Yaj.IL 27 smarfa-liSla (time within living memory) 
in relation to possession means a period of one hundred years, 
while according to "Katyayana and Yyasa it is only n period of 
sixty years 1SM On evidence of the prevalence of a custom ovon 
for 20, 30, 80 or 90 years the Courts have held that n 
presumption may arise that the custom is ancient and that if 
the presumption is not rebutted the Court may accept it as ii 
valid and ancient custom, ,SM Many instances have generally 
to be adduced for proof of a custom. No hard and fast rule can 
be laid down about the number of instances required to prove a

custom. 1893 In certain cases it has been held that specific 
instances are not absolutely necessary, but the opinions 
of persons likely to know the existence of the custom 
is entitled to great weight, even though they may not be able 
to cite specific instances. 1893 ° Customs once prevalent, 
particularly family customs, may come to be dis- 
continued on account of accident, change in popular sentiment 
or by the concurrent will of all the members concerned. 1891 
Customs must be strictly construed and cannot be extended by 
analogy or parity of reasoning. Because in a particular caste 
marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter is allowed by custom* 
it does not follow that marriage with a maternal aunt's or 
paternal aunt's daughter will necessarily be valid. Vide H. of 
Dh, vol H p. 467 notes 1095-6. The evidence about a custom 
should be such as to prove the uniformity and continuity of the 
usage, the conviction of those following it that they were acting 
in accordance with law and the consciousness of obligatorines 
and the custom should not spring from mere habit, imitation 
and ignorance or mutual arrangement. 185S A. custom muBt not 
be unreasonable. A custom of excluding daughters from 
inheritance was held to be not unreasonable according to the 
ideas of the Hindu community. 1896 A custom that only 
members of certain castes ( and not of others) were entitled to 
make use of a temple and to worship therein was held not 
unreasonable in India, though it may appear obnoxious to 
cultured people at the present day. 1B97 

Customs must not be immoral. Whether a custom is 
immoral is to be judged by the Bense of the whole community 1898 ,

A. custom which authorizes a woman of the lower castes to 
contract a second marriage without divorce on payment of a 
certain sum to the caste was held to he immoral 1899 and the 
Bombay High Court refused to recognize the authority of the 
caste to declare a marriage void or to give a woman permission 
to remarry without a release from the husband. 1900 The adop- 
tion of girls by dancing girls ( nations) has not been recognized 
by the Bombay High Court, 1901 though the Madras High Court 
would recognize such an adoption if there was no intention to 
make it for purposes of prostitution. 1902 Dagger marriages are 
practised among oertain castes. The Brahmapurana (chap. 111. 
15 and 44-46 ) states that among ksatriyas there are several 
forms of marriage such as forcibly carrying away the bride 
( which is the form called raksasa ) or marriage with the weap- 
ons ( of the bridegroom ). In modern times dagger or sword 
marriages have not been held' valid by the courts even among 
sudras; vide Maharaja of Kdhapur v. Sundaram 48 Mad. 1, 
Earn Saran v. Mahabir 61 L A. 106. 

Many customs and usages have been expressly forbidden 
by the Central Indian or Provincial Legislatures e. g. SaH™*, 
female infanticide, 190 * slavery, 1905 marriages of children under 
a certain age, 1906 the dedication of women as devadaeis to tem- 
ples or idols. 1907 This being so, no court will allow a party to 
plead a custom against these positive enactments. It was 
recognised in a number of cases that in the Bombay Presi-

gious ceremonies the amount of the fees which would properly 
be payable to the vatandar joshi if he had been employed to 
perform such ceremonies and also the right to recover damages 
from a person who intrudes upon his office. But Bombay Act 
XI of 1926 (the Invalidation of Hindu Ceremonial Emoluments 
Act ) now enacts ( by sec 4 ) that no person shall be entitled to 
claim as a matter of right any ceremonial emoluments from any 
Hindu who does not call in the services of the person claiming 
those emoluments. Therefore, suits of the nature described 
above cannot be brought now in Bombay by a oatandar josh 

How customs and practices once prevalent may come to 
be discontinued or abrogated is well illustrated in the section 
on Kalivarjyas Some of those that have a legal bearing have 
been already discussed above. 



APPENDIX 



Note 191 



Long lists of high functionaries and other officers occur 
in several inscriptions. Vide E. 3. vol. VH at p. 91 ( Kahla 
plate of Sodhadeva ), E. I. vol. 231 at p. 40, E. L vol, XIV at p. 
327 ( grant of MahlpSla ). There are about 40 titles in some ins- 
criptions. They are generally arranged in order of dignity 
and importance, the highest coming first. Sometimes several 
offices are held by the same man. For example, in the Jesar 
plate of Sfladitya ( dated in Valahhi year 357 ) the high officer 
Mammafca is styled ' aandhivigrahadhikrta, divirapati, maha- 
pratlhara, samanta * { E. L XXII at p. 120 ). It is not claimed 
that the following is a thoroughly exhaustive list. It is, how- 
ever, exhaustive enough. Titles and dignitarieB in South Indian 
languages have been generally omitted. Vogel stands for Dr. 
Vogel's work on 'Antiquities of Chamba State' where, on pp. 
120-136, he furnishes informing notes on some officers. There 
is difference of opinion among scholars about the exact mean- 
ing of oertain office names. The individual functions of several 
officers are not quite clear. The references given here as to 
where an office occurs are not exhaustive. Chronologically 
older references alone are generally given and they are mostly 
taken ( bo far as inscriptions are concerned ) from the Epigra- 
phia Indica ( E. L ) and the Indian Antiquary (LA.). Many 
official titleB have the word 'mate" prefixed without any 
change in meaning in some cases. Vide India Office Plate of 
Lafcsmanasena in 'his 27th year (E.I. XXVI. p. 1 at p. 7) 
for many official titles beginning with ' maha*. 

sf^refe;— Vide Mahaksapatalika below. 'Aksapatala' means 
^Account office' (Stein) or 'Record office '(Fleet). There

at p. 12S) and CandravatI plate of Oandradeva dated

the superintendent of ' aksapatala' (II. 7).

=3K—- This word has given rise to various opinions. Fleet and 
Buhler translate as ' irregular soldiers'. Vogel (pp. 130-132) 
points out that Ohamba iB the only place where the ancient 
word 'cata' is still extant in the modern form 'chat* 
meaning * head of a pargcma '. Grants of villages are often 
expressed as * acatabhatapravesya ' ( not to be entered by 
cstasandbhatas)'. For example, in the Surat plate of 
Maitraka Vyfighrasena (E.I. XI at p. 221) it is stated 
that the granted land was not to be entered by catas and 
bhatas except for (seizing) robbers and those guilty of 
harm or treason to the king Similar words occur in the 
Betel plates of Sanksobha in Gupta year 199 ( aoatabha-

The words occur also in the Ehoh plate of Maharaja Hastin 
in Gupta year 191 ( Gupta Ins. No. 23 p. 106 ). Yaj I 336 
states that it is the duty of the king to protect people from 
the harassment caused by catas, robbers and kayasthas and 
the Mit explains cata * as persons who deprive people of 
their wealth after producing false confidence in them. Three 
quarters of the same verse occur in the Paficatantra I p. 72 
verse 343 Apar&rka (p. 792) quotes Brbaspati that ' dangers 
common to all are those arising from catas and thieves '.
