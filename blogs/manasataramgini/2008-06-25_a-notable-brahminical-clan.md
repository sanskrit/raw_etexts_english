Some research into the brAhmaNa-s of the drAviDa country of the vaDama
sect and the bhArgava gotra leads to an interesting family that was
active in the Middle Vijayanagaran period in the court at Hampe. The
patriline belonged to the jAmadagnya vatsa bhArgava gotra.  
aruNagirinAtha-I composed a work on human anatomy, classification of
constitutions and drugs termed the shAriraka-sutra-guNa-pATha. He was in
the court of devarAya-II  
\-His uncle diNDima-bhaTTa was a kavi in the court of devarAya-I. He was
a reputable shrI-vidyA Tantric and composed a commentary on the
saundaryalaharI  
\-rAjanAtha diNDima-II composed the sAluvAbhyudaya.  
\-diNDima sArvabhauma composed the rAmAbhyudaya  
\-aruNagiri-II composed the virabhadravijaya narrating the destruction
of dakSha.  
\-rAjanAtha-III composed the achyutarAyAbyudaya  
Their works are important primary sources of Vijayanagaran history.
