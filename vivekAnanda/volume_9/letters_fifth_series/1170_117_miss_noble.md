## CXVII

*To Sister Nivedita*

CALCUTTA

*30th January 1898*

MY DEAR MISS NOBLE,

This is to introduce Prof. M. Gupta,[1](#fn1) who has been already
introduced to you on board the boat that brought you over to shore.

He has very kindly consented to devote an hour or more every day to
teach you Bengali. I need not state that he is a genuine, good and great
soul.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. I am afraid you felt badly today.

V.
