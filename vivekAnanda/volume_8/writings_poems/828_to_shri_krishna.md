## TO SHRI KRISHNA

(*A song in [Hindi](krishna.pdf)* )

O Krishna, my friend, let me go to the water,  
O let me go today.  
Why play tricks with one who is already thy slave?  
O friend, let me go today, let me go.  
I have to fill my pitcher in the waters of the Jumna.  
I pray with folded hands, friend, let me go.
