title = "King harihara-II praised as a portion of skanda"

+++
The nallur plate of the vijayanagaran king harihara-II praises him as a
portion of skanda i.e. skandAmsha. The part of the inscription that can
be made out reads thus:  
* dharmeNa rakShati kShoNIM vIra-shrI-bhukka-bhUpatI |  
nirAta\~NkAbhayAt-tasmin nitya-bhogotsavAH prajAH ||  
gaurI-sahacharAt-tasmAt prAdurAsIn maheshvarAt |  
shaktyA pratIta skandAMsho rAjA harihareshvaraH ||*  
When noble valiant king bhukka protected the earth with dharma, his
subjects unafraid due to absence of terror (i.e. Islamic depredations)
continually enjoyed festivities.  
From that great lord who moved with gaurI (the name of bhukka’s queen),
was born with power the king lord harihara who was considered a portion
of skanda \[this essentially plays on the terms maheshvara – king bhukka
or shiva, gaurI – pArvatI or the queen and shakti – the power of
harihara-II or the weapon of kumAra\].
