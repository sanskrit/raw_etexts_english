There are certain things that pass of as art in the modern world but do
not appeal to my pre-modern Hindu sensibilities. One day we saw a group
of navya-vidvAn-s discussing what they felt was art, like the monkeys of
viShNusharman sitting around the firefly hoping to ignite a pyre on a
cold winter morning. So we decided to participate in their moha and
produced the above piece for their discussion.
