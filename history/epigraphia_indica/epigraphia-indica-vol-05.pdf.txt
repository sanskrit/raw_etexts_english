A.--VOLUME III. Page 226.- When publishing the Alunpüşdi plate of Virûpåksha, I had to suspect its genuineness, 
owing partly to the numerous mistakes which it contains, and mainly owing to thu absence of any reference to this son of Harihara II. in the published records of the first Vijayanagara dynasty. The historical information conveyed by the plate is. however, confirmed not from an unexpected source. In his Report on a Search for Sanskrit and Tamil lanuscripts (p. 90), Mr. Seshagiri Sastri, Professor of Sanskrit at the Madras Presidency College, has published extracts from a Sanskrit drama entitled Nárilyaniválása. This drama was composed by i royal anthor named Virúpáksha, who was the son's son (here the published reading putrô, “ son, has to be correctal into pautrů, son's son') of king Bukka, the daughter's son of king Råma, and the son of king Harihara. Of Virupaksha it is further said that ho was the loul of the Karnata, Tuydira, Chola and Pandya countries, that he pluted a pillar of victory in the island of Simhala (Ceylon), and that he was devoted to tłu performance of the 'sixteen groat gifts.' In doscribing the genealogy of Virůpáksha and his conquests, the Ålampânơi grant and the drama Narayanivilisa are practically at one with each other. The performance of the sixteen great gifts,' hich is mentioned in the latter in connection with Viúpåksha, is attribated in the former to his father. There is no doubt whatever as to the identity of the author of the Sanskrit drama in question with prince Virůpåksha of the Alampûņdi grant. The former is inore explicit in describing his rolutionship to king Ritum, inasmuch as he is there called the daughter's son' of king Râma, while the latter simply says that his mother Mallådêyi belonged to the family of Ramadêva.' It may therefore be concluded that Ramadêva, whom I proposed to idontify with the Yadava king Ramachandra (above, Vol. III. p. 225), had a daughter und Mallådévi, who married Harihara II. of the first Vijayanagara dynasty, and that priuca Virüpåksha, who was born of this marriage,

B. --VOLUME IV. Page 195, 1, 10 ff. Mr. Ramayya has kindly informed me (through Dr. Hultzsch), that the 
correct spelling of the modern name of the village is Dendulůru, not Deydaluru, as given in Mr. Sewell's Lists of Antiquities. As regards the identification of other localities montioned in the Chikkulla platea, Mr. Sewell has heen the first to frite to me that Râ vireva (in line 20) might be the village of 'Raveralah.' (Råviróla) on the north bank of the river Krishpa, just at the top of its great bend, long. 80° 10' E., lat. 16° 50' N. The same identification was afterwards suggested by Dr. Fleet and by Mr. Ramayya. Mr. Ramayya further writes that about six miles to the east of Råvirèla there is the village of Navâbapêta, with a temple of Sömunàthasvâmin which may bo the Somagiris varanátha teniple in line 23 of the inscription. Thu conutry in which the villages were situated is called Nat[ri]pati

[ Vol. V. 
(in line 19). This Mr. Ramayya believes to be the more modern Natavada, "which is mentioned in an inscription of śaka 1123 at Bezvada, in which the donor is described as Nåtaradi. Rudradêvarújult, i.e. Rudradêvarâja of Nätavada. The capital of this chief was Madapalla or Madapalli, and there is a village of this name, reported to contain the ruins of an old fort, close to the west of Madhira, a station 
of H. H. the Nizam's State Railway, and not far from Kondapalli."— F. Kielhora. Page 206, line 8 of the text.-- I have altered the original reading - Pándy-Otpala-mahipatayo 
to-Pindy-Otkala-mahipatayo, which on page 207 I have translated by " the Pandya and Utkala kings ;" but I was wrong. The original reading Plîndy-Otpala is correct, and the translation should have been " the Pandya and king Utpala." Utpala is another name of the Paramâra king Muñja, who is mentioned under that name also in line 42 of the Kauthêm plates of Vikramaditya V. (Ind. Ant. Vol. XVI, p. 23, where he is described as kavitrisha, i.e, kavandrah), and in the Miraj plates of Jayasimba II, and the Yêir inscription of Vikramaditya VI. (ibid. Vol. VIII. p. 15, where the text has Utkala with the various reading Utpala).

Krishna Sastri considers that, instead of connecting utkata with its meanings of uneven, difficult; intoxication, pride; affliction,' it is better to take it in its meaning of mad, furious.

No. 1.- THE ASOKA EDICTS OF PADERIA AND NIGLIVA. 
By G. Bühler, PH.D., LL.D., O.I.E. MHE two new Asôka edicts of Padêria and Nigliva are edited here according to inked 
I estampages, furnished by their discoverer, Dr. A. A. Führer, who found the second in March 1895 and the first in December 1896. Both come from the Nepal Terai, where Nigliya is situated 38 miles north-west of the Uska Bazar station of the Bengal and North-Western Railway, in the Nepalese tahsil Taulikvär of the zillah Butaul. Padêria lias two miles north of the Nepalese tahsil Bhagvânpur of the same zillah, and according to Dr. Führer's estimate about thirteen miles from Nigliva. Both are incised on mutilated stone pillars, and the Padêria edict, which was found three feet below the surface of the ground, is in a state of perfect preservation, while that of Nigliva has suffered a great deal on the left side and has lost the first five letters of line 3 as well as the first seven of line 4. 
The characters of the two edicts agree exactly with those of the north-eastern pillar edicts of Radhia, Mathia and Râmptrva, and their language is the Màgadhi of the third century B.O., which is found also in the other pillar-edicts, in the Kålsi, Dhauli and Jangada versions of the rock-edicts, in the two Bairåt and the Sahasråm edicts, in the care-inscriptions of Barabar, and in the Sôhgaurâ copper-plate, and which may be recognised by the invariable substitution of la for ra and of na for ra, by the nominatives singular in 6, and by the word hida for idha. A peculiarity which re-occurs only in the north-eastern pillar-edicts, is the comparatively frequent shortening of final d in piyadasina, läjina, atana and kilópita. New words and forms, not found in the other Asôka edicts, are athabhágiye (Paderia, 1. 3), agacha (Paderia, 1. 2; Nigliva, 1. 3), ubalike (Paderia, 1. 4), usapápite (Paderia, 1. 3; Nigliva, 1. 4), Bhagavam (Padêria, 1. 4), mahiyite (Padêria, 1. 2 ; Nigliva, 1.3) and rigadabhi (Pađâria, 1. 3), to which may be added the names of Konúkamana (Nigliva, l. 2), Luiminigama (Pađêria, 1. 4) and Sakyamuni (Paqêria, 1. 2). The wording of the two inscriptions agreas very closely, and leaves no doubt that they were incised at the same time. It makes also the restoration of the lost portions of the Nigliva edict easy and absolutely certain.

[Vol. V. 
The great importance of the Padêria inscription for the topography of ancient India and the sacred history of the Buddhists has been fully recognised by Dr. Führer, who has discussed it in an article in the Pioneer of December 1896. It fixes with absolute certainty the situation of the garden of Lumbini where according to the Buddhist tradition prince Siddhartha was born. No adverse criticism can shake the evidence of the repeated assertiod: 6 Here Buddha Śâkyamuni was born," and : " Here the worshipful one was born," as well as of the mention of Luiminigama, the first part of which name agrees with Irumbini in accordance with the analogy of Páli ammâ for ambá and drammana for dlambena. Even the possible, but a priori improbable assumption that the pillar might have been brought to Padéria from some other place, is bazred by the fact mentioned by Dr. Führer, that the site is still called Rummin. ddi, and by the evidence of Hiven Tsiang. The Chinese pilgrim, as Dr. Führer has duly noted, mentions the pillar as standing close to four Stậpas, the ruins of which are still extant. He further says that it was broken in the middle through the contrivance of a wicked dragon ; and its upper part actually seems to have been shattered by lightning, which the Buddhists ascribe to the anger of the Nâgas, called 'dragons' by the Chinese. If Hinen Tsiang omits to mention the inscription, the reason is no doubt, as Dr. Führer thinka, that it was covered at the time of his visit by an accumulation of débris. As stated already, it was found three feet below the ground, and the portion of the pillar which was visible on Dr, Führer's arrival, a piece only mins, feet high, is covered with pilgrims' records, one of which was incised about A.D.800. It is evident that the Asoka inscription must have been covered at least at that date. 
The Padêria edict, of course, fixes also the site of Kapilavastu and of the sanctuaries in its neighbourhood, Fahion says that the Lumbini garden lies 50 li or, adopting Sir A. Cunningham's reckoning, 87 miles east of the capital of the såkyas, and Dr. Führer bas found its extensive ruins eighteen miles north-west of Padêria between the villages of Amauli and Bikali (north-east) and Råmghåt on the Bangangå (south-test)," covering a space seven miles long and from three to four miles broad. The country of the Säkyas, it now appears, has been looked for too far south by Sir A. Cunningham and his assistants. Sir A. Cunningham's error has been caused by the vague statements of the Chinese pilgrims, who both say that in travelling from Sråvasti to Kapilavastu they went south-east. As he had discovered by epigraphical evidence the identity of Srâvasti with the modern Sêt or Sabêt Mahết between Akaona and Balrimpar, it was but natural for him to infer that Kapilavastu must lie either in the Basti district or in Görakhpur. Nevertheless, the town lay much further north, and it may be pointed out that its real position agrees with the hints, given in the Ceylonese canonical books. According to the Ambattha-Sutta the banished sons of Ikshváku or Okkåka settled yattha Himavantapassé pókharaniya tirê maha säkasando; " where there was a great grope of såka trees (Teciona grandis) on the bank of a lake (situated on the slopes of the Elimdlaya." This description fits the Nepalese Terai better than the absolutely flat districts of Basti and Gorakhpur, which are still some distance from the hills. The fact that the śAkyu were real jungle-Rájputs is not without importance for their history and tho explanation of their curious customs. It makes their assertion that their ancestors were forcibly

ejected from the more civilised districts in the south very credible, though the truth of the cause of their banishment, stated in the Buddhist work quoted above, muy be doubted. Further, their isolation in the jungles may have led, as the canon alleges, to their custom of endogany, so repaguant to all Rajputs and to all the higher casies in India. And this custom, - not their pride of race, as they themselves asserted, Tas no doubt the reason wliy the other royal families of Northern India did not intermarry with them. This isolation and the consequent estrangement from the rest of the Hindû population probably accounts also for their disinclination, mentioned in the Ambattha-Sutta, to show hospitality to the Brâhmans who came to their settlement from Srivasti or other parts of India. Their religion, however, was Saivism and of the ordinary type of Hindûism. Hinen Triangl was still shown near the eastern gate of Kapilavastu the old temple of Isvara, where the infant Siddhartha was taken by his father, because " the Sakya children who here seek divine protection always obtain what they ask.” According to the legend the stone image then raised itself and saluted the prince. Mr. Beal las correctly recognised that the scene is represented on the Amaravati Stapa. The legend is therefore ancient and undoubtedly points to the conclusion that Śiva was the kuladévatá of the sakyas, Perhaps Dr. Führer will pay special attentiou to this temple, which certainly must be one of the oldest Sivite monuments of which we have knowledge and possesses great interest for the history of the Brihmaņical religions. 
In addition to the ruins of Kapila vastu Dr. Führer has also succeeded in tracing the site of Napeikia-Nábhiks, the supposed birth-place of the mythical Boddha Krakuchchhanda, and of the Stûpa of his Nirvâņa, which is still cighty feet high, exactiy in the position indicated by Fahien, viz. one yojana or "77 miles" south-west of Kapilavastı. The important sites of Râmagrâma and of Kusinârâ, whcre Asoka's pillar with an undated record of Säkyamuni's Nirvana existed in. Hinen Tsiang's time, will bave to be looked for in the eastern portion of the Nepalese Terai. If the direction given by the Chinose, - east of Lumbini,- is correct, Kusinârâ cannot be identianl with Kasia in the Gôrakhpur district, where Sir A. Cunningham and Mr. Carlleyle believed to bave found its ruins. 
The value of the Nigliva edict for the history of Buddhism has been pointed out in my preliminary notice of the documont. As the Stûpa of Könikamana was "increased" or enlarged for the second time in Aśôka's fifteenth year, it would appear that the monument had been erected before the beginning of the king's reign, or before B.C. 259. Kônâkımına or Kônågamana belongs to the long series of purely mythical predecessors of the historical fonnder of Buddhism. The mythology of Buddhism must not only have been developed, but the myths must have been fixed locally, before it could occur to the Faithful to build Stậpas in honour of their heroes. It seems difficult to believe that all these stagos of the development could have been accomplished in a short time. As they bad been completed in the first half of the third century B.O., it becomos probable that the origin of Buddhism lies very much earlier and that, therefore, it is impossible, as some scholars have done, to fix the Nirvana in B.O. 350 or in B.C. 325. The remoter date, cir. B.C. 477, is, aut in on this consideration, the more probable one. I regret that, when writing my first notice, I overlooked that the Stûpa, the pillar and its inscription are mentioned by Hiuen Tsiang in the Siyruki, Vol. II. p. 19. If I had noticed this, I might have announced at once that the site of Kapilavastu must be looked for in its neighbourhood. Dr. Fübrer, who years ago had shown Mr. Carlloyle's identiíication of Bhuila with Kapilavastu to be erroneous, apparently found the passage and hence gave expression to the expectation of discovering the Sakya capital near Bhagvânpur in bis

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
[VOL. V. 
Progress Report of 1895-96. According to an article in the Calcutta Englishman of June 1st and extracts in the Journal of the Mahúbôlhi Suozety, Vol. V. pp. 82 and 83, Dr. L. Waddell made the same discovery in 1896, published it in the Englishman, and applied for permission to proceed to Nepal. 
As regards Asôka's history, the two edicts inform us that in the twenty-first year of his reign he went on a pilgrimage to the sacred places of the Buddhists situated in the extreme north. Very probably he visited on this occasion, as the legend in the Divyávalára, p. 386 ft. (Cowell and Neil), asserts, not only the Stüpa of Kônákanana and the Lumbini garden, but also further east the site of Buddha's Nirvana and Ramagrâma, and further west Kapilavastu, the Stūpas of Krakuchehhanda and the old town of Srâvasti, in several of which localities, pillars with his inscriptions were extant in Hiuen Tsiang's times. The Archeological exploration of the Nepalese Terai will bring certainty on this print. Asóka's route from Pâţaliputra lowards the Terai is perbaps marked by the series of pillars extending froin Bakbra near Vaibali through Radbis and Mathia to Râmpúrra in the Champáran district, most of which were later on inscribed with the so-called pillar odicts. The fact that Asoka undertook such a journey may be interpreted as indicating that he was at the time a believing Buddhist. But it may also be looked upon as one of the Shanmayútds which, as the eighth rock-edict saya, he undertook regularly since the eleventh year of his reigu in order to obtain enlightenment. 
The two edicts tend also to show that the Nepal Terai formed part of Afòka's dominious. This is indisputable if the Padêria inscription declares that the king remitted the taxes of the village of Luńmini. But even the more fact that Asoka planted his pillars all over the Terai favours the view that it was subject to his rule.

3. Ti, rendered here by 'saying,' may of course also be translated by ' for 'or because.' 
4. The translation of vigadabhi is not certain. It may be a word governing silâ, and & technical term of unknown meaning. My translation is based on the supposition that it is a compound adjective, qualifying sila and equivalent to Sanskrit vikațábhri. Pikuţübhrí might be represented in a Prákşit dialect of the Pâli type by vigndabbhi, which would become vigadabhi according to the popular spelling of the edicts. For ga instead of kc occurs in Aitiyoga (Kálsi edict ü, 1. 5, ed. xiii. 2, 1. 9) for Antiyolca in the other versions), in Toga (Jaugada sep. ed. ii. 1. 7) for loka, and in adhigicha (Bairât i. 1. 6) for adhifritya. And da i istead of ta is found in ambavadika (Allahabad, queen's edict) and ribavadikya (Delhi Sivalik pillar-edict vii. 2, 1. 2) for Påli ambuvaţiki, in Bhasikada (Cunningham, Sáñchi Stúpa, i. No. 156) for "kata, and in apadihata on the Indo.Grecian coins for Pali apațihata and Sanskrit apratiñata. If my transliteration vikațábhri is correct, the second part of the word must be either abhrí or abhra. The first will not do on account of its meaning, and the second will suit only if it is taken to mean the sun,' which meaning is assigned to abhra in the Košas. A stone slab, bearing a large representation of the sun, might have been put up in the Lambini garden in order to indicate that Säkyamani claims to be arkabandhu or idityabandhu, a scion of the solar race of Ikshyåkt. Professor Pischel, whom I consulted regarding the three difficult hapax legomena of this inscription, takes the word differently. He says: "I suspect that vigadabhi is the Sanskrit vigardabht. According to Hêm:chandra, ii. 37, gardabha becomes in Prakrit gaddaha or gaddaha, In Marathî it becomes gadhava and is according to Molesworth also a terra for a rude block or & rough stone,' Hence vigaddabhi might mean “finely wronght, polished,' or something like it. Literally it would be 'not so uncouth as a donkey.'" 
5. Usapápite 'is equivalent to Pâli ussäpitô and Sanskrit uchchhrápitaħ. For the double pa compare likhápápitá, Delhi Sivalik pillar-edict vii. 2, l. 10, and Påli viññûpåpeti. 
6. I here adopt M. Barth's rendering, published in the Journal des Savants, 1897, p. 73. M. Barth explains ubalike, in accordance with a suggestion of M. Senart, as equivalent to Sanskrit * udbalikaḥ and derives athabhágiye from arthabhága. The explanation of the second word is unobjectionable and is supported, as M. Barth points out, by the statement of the Divyavadana (p. 390), according to which Asoka presented on his visit to Lumbinivana one hundred thousand (suvarnas) to the people of the country. The identification of ubalike with * udbalikah, which was suggested to me also by Professors Leumann and Oldenberg, offers some difficulties. Taken as a Bahuvrihi compound, *udbalikah would mean udbhůtah or udastah balih yasya sah, rich in taxes' or 'with raised taxes,' in accordance with the analogy of utpaksha, utpuchchlig,' udagra, udambhas, etc. And as far as I know, there is no Bahuvrihi in which ut is used in the sense of mukta. Taken as a Tatpurusha, irregularly enlarged by the addition of ka, - udbali(ka) must stand, according to the Kašikd, loc. cit., for baléh uterántaḥ, 
one who has left the taxes;' compare also the numerous analogous compounds like uchohhrin. khald, utpuchchha, utsútra, udbila, udvdsa, unnidra, etc. The use of * udbalikah in the sense of 
exempt from taxes? would therefore be unidiomatic, and it is not supported by any.analogies, as compounds like * utkara for alcara or nishkara, * udriņa for anrina or nirriņa, and * uchchhulka are not found. Perhaps it will be better to explain ubalike, as Mr. Tawney has suggested to me, by *avabalikaḥ or * apabalikah; regarding the contraction of ava and apa to o, û or u in Pâli, see E. Müller, Simplified Pali Grammar, p. 42 f.

BIJ. F. FLEET, Po.D., C.L.E. Yekkêri is a village about four miles towards the north by east from Saundatti, the chief town of the Parasgad tåluke of the Belgaum district. The record is engraved on a rock in & glen, somewhere about a mile or & mile and a half to the north-east of the village. Tho existence of it was brought to my notice in December, 1894, by Veńkangauda bin Yellapagauda, of the neighbouring village of Hüli. I edit it from ink-impressions which Dr. Holtzsch was kind enough to obtain for me. 
The whole writing covers an area about 7' 2" broad by 3' 11" high. About two feet of the breadth, however, are occupied by the benedictive and imprecatory verses, which stand on the proper right of the essential part of the record: to avoid reducing the scale of the collotype too far, it has not been thought nocessary to include them in the Plate; but the mni of bloûni, line 13, is discernible just before the commencement of line 3; and the marks below it represent, imperfectly, parts of the word phalan, line 14.-- The characters are of the regular typo, for the locality, of the period to which the record refers itself, viz. the first half of the seventh century A.D.; and they are boldly formed and well cut. They include numerical symbols in lines 5, 7, 8.3 The size of the ordinary letters ranges from ?"

It must be noted that, in the collotypo published here with, the symbol has not come out well from the inx-impression on the whole, the better of the two) which I selected for reproduction ; the lower side-stroke, to the right from the bottom part of the akshard, shows only faintly: in the other impression, the aleshara is quite clear and unmistakable; and theta it distinctly reads og ned. - In the saine lins, again, we have, for eight;' Bymbol which, in the side-stroke to the loft from the top of the akshara, in the down-stroke on the right from the end of the top-stroke, and in the line across the ceutre of the body of the akshara, differs & good deal from any of the forms given by the Pandit and interpreted by him as head or home In line 7 we have, for

(in the pa of vrupa, line 1) to 2" (in the bhute of bhagavató, line 4). The $ri of rájya-sri, line 2, is 5" high. The language is Sanskrit; and, except for the two bene dictive and imprecatory verses, the whole record is in prose. The record was composed, however, by someone who had a very imperfect knowledge of the language, and who could neither construct his sentences properly nor even spell correctly. I have noted, in and below the text, a few corrections of the more simple kind. But, from udita, line 1, to rajyé, line 4, the whole text requires emendation: either the whole must be turned into a compound, in which case, we must read (line 2) prithivi-svámi, and (line 3) prithivy-apratiratha and Srimat; or else mahárúja (line 4) must be turned into the gonitive, maharajasya, and we must read (line 1) prasútasya, and bhitasya, (line 2) svåminah and rájya-sriyaḥ, and (line 3) mandalasya, apratirathasya, and frimatah.- In respect of orthography, the only point calling for special notice is the unnecessary insertion of the anusvára before the basals in vamaisa, line 1 (twice), samamnta and manndala, line 3, painñcha, lines 5 and 6, pumnyard, lines 6 and 9, parrñchusat, line 7, and vasurindhardt, line 16. 
The inscription refers itself to the reign of the Western Chalukya king Pulikesin II. It is dated in one of his regnal years; but all that can be made out here is a numerical symbol which, if we contrast it with the symbol for height' which we have in line 5, must, I suppose, be interpreted as meaning 'six;' just before it, there is an illegible akshara, which may be either the syllable mi or pair of sain vatsarani or samvatsaránúin, or a numerical symbol meaning ten,' 'twenty,' or some higher figure: the date mentions also the full-moon tithi of the month Kârttika; but it does not include any details that admit of calculation. The object of the inscription was to record that certain lands, in certain towns, were the property of the god Mahâdêya (Šiva). 
Mention is made of villages or towns named Benira, Dhutipura, and Âgariyapura, and perhaps Křishnapura ; but these places cannot aow be traced on the neap, 
About four feet away to the left of the above record, there is engraved on the rock, in similar characters, another inscription, of four short lines, covering an area about 2'0" broad by 1' 10" high. The first line of it is illegible. The remainder speaks of four nivartanas of land at a place named, apparently, Sindavalaga.

No. 3.- INSCRIPTIONS AT MANAGOLI. 
BY J. F. FLEET, PA.D., C.I.E. Managôli' is a village about eleven miles to the north-west of Bågewädi, the chief town of the Bågewâdi taluka of the Bijapur district. With the difference of the lingual me for the dental n, its name occurs in the ancient records as Maņigavalli (e.g., A. below, lines 18, 19) and Maņingavalli (e.g., ibid. line 17); and we also have the Sanskritised form Manikyavalli, “the village of rubies" (e.g., ibid. line 20). From A. below, lines 18, 24, we learn that it was in the group of towns and villages which was known as the Tardavadi thousand, and which took its name from a town that is now represented by the small village of Taddewidi, the « Taddehwartee' and 'Tudewadee of maps, on the south bank of the Bhimâ, in the Indi tâlnka, about thirty-seven miles to the north of Bijapur. And line 54 of the game record mentions it as an agrahára; in consequence of which we may perhaps reckon it among " the eighteen agraharas" which are spoken of in other records. 
The records at Managðļi are on stone tablets which have been built into the walls of a modern temple of Hanumat. I edit them from ink-impressions made by my own man. 
A.-Of the time of Bijjala; A.D. 1161. The writing of this record covers an area about 2' 10" broad by 46.5" high. From the beginning of line 36 to the centre of the last line, there is a fissure by which the tablet has

Hüli, in the Belgaum district, WAR one of them; and Nargund, in Dhirmir, was another, Others, perhaps, were Dumbal in Dharwår, Kurvet io Belgaum, and Honwid in Bijapur.

been broken into two pieces : but even along this fissure there are but few letters that have been destroyed; and the rest of the record is in a state of very good preservation. The sculptures above it, at the top of the tablet, are, in the centre, a linga, with the sun and moon above it; on the proper right, a seated figure; and, on the proper left, a crooked sword, dagger, or knife, and a cow and calf.-- The characters are Kanarese, of the regular type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well forined and well executed throughout. They include decimal figares in lines 39, 43, 46, and 60, and the distinct forin of the lingual d all through: the virána is represented , sometimes by its own proper sign, as in satiyol, line 4, dda, line 8, tiruvar, line 46, nadasul, line 64, sthal udal, line 66, and samayangat, line 67, and sometimes by the sign for the letter 2, as in pogaļalu, lino 17, mathadulu, liae 44, and kayyala, line 52; cases in which the two methods of expressing it are pointedly contrasted, are, enal and enalu, lines 24 and 30, and paduval, múdal, badagal, paduvalu, múdalu, and baqagalu, lines 42, 47, and 48. The size of the letters ranges from about f" to ". - The language is Kanarese. There are ordinary verses in lines 1 to 35, and some of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses in lines 56 to 59. We have the nominative plural ending in Hg as in the modern or colloquial form of the language, in aynúrvuaru, line 24, where the metre shews that the x is to be pronounced; and with this we have to contrast the archaic or stilted form sanaya igal, in line 67 : cases in which it is not certain whether the v is to be pronounced, or whether it represents the viráma, are illustrated by painditaru, lina 50, and kotfart, line 67, es contrasted with panditar, line 51, and kottar, line 67. The accusative singular nenter in v occurs in gókulavan, line 59; but, otherwise, the archaic form in m appears throughout, as in jasaman, line 27, dspadaman, line 32, kaumâraman, line 44, and dharmmaman, line 54.-- In respect of orthography, the only points that call for special notice are (1) the use of ri for si, throughout, as in dlankriti, line 3, and mripatige, line 7; (2) the use of 6 for v in sêbyan, line 24, and dibya, line 31 ; and (3) an affected use of the Dravidian ? in Cháfukyar, line 5, and alaikärav, line 24. 
The inscription is a record of the time of the Kaļachurya king Bijjala. Before, however, it proceeds to recite certain donations made in his reign, it makes reference, in lines 1 to 59, to certain events of the time of the Western Chalukya king Perma-Jagadêkamalla II. In that part of the record, after some introductory genenlogical and historical matters, a register is made of certain grants which were bestowed by Perma-Jagadêkamalla II. himself, and by other people, on the god Siva, in the form of the local god Kalidêvêsvara," the Siddhalinga of the soath," -- of Manigavalli. The introductory part mentions a person named Isvaraghaļishsa, of the Harita gôtra (line 16), who, it asserts, was a Jagadguru or leading pontiff in the time of the Western Chalukya king Taila II., and was endowed by that king, at his coronation, with the town of Maņingavalli; and in the lineage of this person it places a certain Madhava (line 20), who is to be identified with the Madiraja (line 37) who held the post of Maháprabhu of the village at the time when the grants were made. It further tells us that the temple of Kalidêyêśvara had been built by a certain Basava (line 28) or Basavarasayya (line 30), son of Chandra or Chandiraja and Chandrâmbike (line 28). who belonged to the Kasyapa götra (line 25) and was one of the five-hundred Mahajanas or Bråbmans of Mapigavalli. And the occurrence of the names of Basava and Madiraja in this Saiva record from the neighbourhood of Bâgewadi, and in connection with the foundation and endowment of a linga-temple which was evidently of some considerable size and repute, is rather suggestive of our having at last met with an epigraphic mention of the

original of that Basava who, according to the Lingayat traditions as embodied in the Basava Purana and Channabasara-Purana, was born at Bågewadi to a Saiva Brahman named Madiraja, and subsequently, becoming the prime-minister of the Kalacharya king Bijjala, overthrew the Jains, revived Saivism, and established the sect of Vira-Saivas or Lingayats. The remainder of the record, line 59 to the end, rofers to the reign of the Kalachurya king Bijjala ; and it registers a variety of grants made by various persons to the same god Kalidérésvara. 
The record contains two dates. As the first date (lines 38-40), for the donations that were made before the time of Bijjala, it cites the tenth tithi, coupled with Thursday and the winter solstice, of the bright fortnight of the month Pansba of the Dundubhi samvatsard, which was the Gifth year of the reign of Perma-Jagadékamalla II. The given sanvatsara was Saka-Samvat 1065 current. And this date does not work out correctly. The tithi ended, at about 14 hrs. 2 min. after mean sunrise (for Bombay), not on a Thursday, but on Tuesday, 29th December, A.D. 1142; and this was four days after the winter solstice, which, us represented by the Makara-sankranti or passage of the sun into Capricornus, occurred at about 3 hrs. 8 min., again not on a Thursday, but on Friday, 25th December. There must, therefore, have been some mistake made, either in taking the date from the archive from which the material for this part of the record was derived, the characters shew that the whole record was put on the stone at one and the same time, by one and the same land), - or else in the original computation of the date. The second date (lines 59, 60) is the sixth tithi, coupled with Tuesday, of the dark fortnight of the month Bhadrapada of the Vishu samvatsara, which was the sixth year of the reign of Bijjala. The yiyen saivatsara was Saka-Sanyat 1084 current. And the corresponding English date is Tuesday, 12th September, A.D. 1181, on which day the given tithi, of the amánta Bhadrapada, ended at about 18 hrs. 8 min. after mean sunrise. In line 64, the tithi is mentioned by the technical name of kapila-chatti. 
In lines 67, 68, mention is made of a festival called núla-parvan. The reference must be to the núla-hunnure or full-moon of the month Sravana. And it may be useful to give herg the Kanarese names of all the full-moons and new-moons, as given to me on three or four different occasions, with the explanations of them as far as they can be determined at present. As will be seen further on, there are reforences to some of these special names in other epigraphic records. 
The month Chaitra ; March-April. The full-moon is called davanada-hunnuveit because, I am told, on this day the people place the fragrant leaves of the davana-plant on the images of the god Mallikarjuna of Srisaila. The new-moon is called akshatadige-amavâse; because 
The full descont of the reigning king is not given. But the use of the style Pratápa-Chakravartin (line 36) stamps him as Perma-Jagad kannalle II.- On the chance, however, that the record, wbich is not a contem. poraneous one, makes & mistake between him and his ancestor who had the silme biruda, I have calcolated the date for alao Sakn-Samvat 945 current, in the reign of Jagadékamalla-Japisimba IT. But here, again, the detaile do not work out correctly. In that year, the given tithi ended, not ona Thursdny, but on Wednesday, 5th December, 4.0, 1022, at about 18 lirs. 36 min, after mean sunrise; and this was eighteon days before the Makara. sankranti, which occurred at about 1 hr. 56 inin., Aguin not on a Thursday, but on Monday, 24th December, 
* The original has Visha, by mistake for Fishe. Monier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary does not rocognise this name of the satinatsara (the fifteenth in the cycle), and gives only the name Vpisha. But Kittel's Kanuade English Dictionary gives Vishu as the name current in Mysore; the suide name is given by C. P. Brown in his Carnatic Chronology: and it occurs in other rucords also from the Knnarege country. 
The line of inquiry is an interesting one. And I hope that, now that attention is drawn to it, other scholars may be able to throw more light on it. 
+ Instead of hunnuvi and smo vase, the rustics genernlly use the word habba, festival.' 
Reeve and Sanderson's Canarese Dictionary mentions (8.0. dovana) the davanada-habba, davanaria-lunninne, but, overlooking the reference to the full-moon, explains it as "a feast on the twelfth lunar day, when the above frngrant shrub is in perfection."

it is followed, on Vaisakha śnkla 3 (tadige = tritiya), by the festival called aksha-tadige, t.e. akshaya-tsitiya or akshayya-tritiyi. This new-moon name occurs in records of A.D. 1054 ind 1195 (see page 14 below). 
Vaisakha; April-May.-- The full-moon is called agi-huņņuve; apparantly because the time then arrives for trunsplanting the seedlings (age) of rice, tobacco, pepper, etc. The new. moon is called bådami.amavåse ; because, it is suggested, worship is then done to the goddess Bainasımkari of the well-known temple two or three miles south of Badâmi in the Bijapur district. 
Jyaishtha ; May-June.-- The fall-moon is called kâra-huņnuve; from kárz, " the rainy season," which commences in this month. On this full-moon day there is celebrated the festival caller hari hariyrua habba, when bullocks are raced, the winner being the one that first reaches and breaks & string of leaves drawn across the course -- in order to obtain an augury as 10 the prospects of the season - The new-moon is called mannettina-amavåse; because the pcoplu theo make clay images of bullocks (man-ettu), and worship them. 
Ashādha ; Juzne-July.-- The full-moon is called Kadlegadabina-hunnuve. Two explana tions are suggested : one, that the people then make cakes (kadabu) of gram (hadle, kadule) and offer them to the goddess Yellamme; the other, that the cultivators then decorate the necks of their bullocks with strings of sach cakes. The new-moon is usually called vågara-amavâse ; because it is followed, on Srůynna sukla 5, by the nuga-panchami, when Forship is done to the cobra (11úga, rúgara-hůvu). But it appears to be also sometimes known as Divasi-amavâse; because, it is said, girls, after marriage, then worship images of a goddess named Divasi. 
Sravaņa; July August.— The full-moon is called nula-huņņuve; because on this day the ceremony is annually performed of renewing the sacred thread (nului, otherwise called janithra, and in $angkşit yaj ñópavita). The new-moon is called chauti-amavâse; because it is followod, on Bhadrapada śukla 4 (chauti, chavuti, = chaturthi), by the Ganéía-chaturthi, when Forship is done to the god Gaņēša. For the same reason, it is sometimes called benakana amavåse; Benaka being a corruption of Vinayaka, one of the names of Ganesa, 
Bhadrapada; Angust-September.-- The full-moon is usually called anantana-hunnuve; because the preceding day is the ananta-chaturdasi, which, Molesworth's Marathi Dictionary says, is sacred to the god Vishnu, in the form of Anantan It seems to be sometimes also called 
1 Kittel'e Kalmudi-English Dictionary explains the aksha-tritfye, 13 it is thero oalled, as a Saira feast on Chaitra sukla 3. But Ganpat Krishnnji's Pañchang and the Patwardhani Paichdng place the feast on Vaisakha šukis 8; 80, also, Monier-William s' Seuskpit Dictionnry, which explains it (s.0. akshaya) 49" festival, the third day of the bright half of Vaisakha, which is the first day of the Satya-guga, and secures perinanongs to actious then performed;" 80, also, Reeve and Sanderson's Canarese Dictionary, which explains it (s.v. akaka-tadige) 1 " ceremony, in the second Hindů month, on the third ludir day, of murried women, who bathe, present to each 
other turmeric, betel nut and fruit, and then make un offering of flowers, etc., to Gauri." 
This festival is described in the Barana-Purana (sre the Rev. G, Würth's translation, Jour, Bo. Br. 2. As. Soc. Vol. VIII. pp. 90, 91): it is there placed on the full-moon of the third month of the Hindú year lie. Jyaishtha); and we are told thati, if a black bullock bronks the string, all sorts of leguminous frnits will succeed, while, if ! white bullock breaks the string, the white millet will thrive.- Kittel, also, in his Kannada. English Dictionary, s.v. Idru, places it on the kodra-munquve in the third month. Under the word kari (3), 
unpropitiousnesa,' he explains that Kari lari means "to tear, ie, do away witi, un propitiousness; an act that, "ou n certain day (kdra-hunnive) is represented by throwing an iron ball, that is attached to a rope, overa 
törana, and thus pulling down the tórana, when the ornamented bullooks of the place, that previousle had "ipnosed under the tórann, are playfully driven about." But the ceremony described in the Basara-Purâna is the one with which I ain familiar: except that the divination seems to be more directed to the comparative prospects of the early and Inte crops ; the iden being that, if & white ballock is the winner, the liter crops will be the better, wh rean, if & ballock of another colour wins, the early crops will give the better yield.-- Reeve and Sanderson's Canarese Dictionary, e.V. kari, explains the festival as "a ceremony of bronking in two, by bullocka or other means, the triumphal arch of a gateway, the day after pongal-feast," and thus (see Kittel's Dictionary. 80. pongalu) would place it the day after the Mukara-82 krånti, in the luonth Pausha.

jokyâna-hunnuve; but I hire not obtained the explanation of this. The new-moon is called navaratri-&mapáse, or mahậnavami-amavåse; because it is immediately followed, on Aśpina bakla 1, by the nine-days festival (trava-rdtrz) of the goddess Dargå, ending with the dasari holiday on the ninth day which is called muha-navami," the great ninth tithi.” 1 
Åsvina ; September-October - The full-moon is called sigi-huņņuve; because, it is said, on this day the people worship the goddess Gauri under the name of Sigi-Gauri. It appears to have been called in ancient times herjuggiya-buņņuve, “the full-moon of the principal harvest-time" (see page 15 below). The new-noon is called dîpåvall-g mavase, or divalige-amaväse; because during the same or the immediately following night there is the dipárali, dirali, or divalige festival of lamps, when the houses and streets are illuminated. 
Kârttika ; October-November. The full-moon is called gauri-hungurs; because, it is said, on this day worship is done to the most honoured form of the goddess Gauri as Hive. Gaurî, “ the great or original Gauri."- The new-moon is called chatti-amavase ; because it is followed, on Margasirsha śukla 6 (chatti = shashthi), by the champa-shashthi, when, accorda ing to Molesworth's Marâțlui Dictionary, there is a festival of the god Khandoba or Khanderao, an jucarnation of Siva. 
Märgaśirsha ; November-December.-The full-moon is asually caller hostala. hunnuve ; because tlıresholds (hostalzz) are decorated and worshipped on this day. But it seems to be sometimes also called rando-huņņuve; in some connection, it is said, with the golless Yollamma as i widow (rande).- The new.moon is called yella-amavåse : becamse it stands next before the Makara-samkrånti or winter solstice, in celebration of which complimen. tiury packets of sesamum seeds (ellu, yell u) are sent about to friends and acquaintances. 
Pausha ; December-January. The full-moon day is called banda-hunnuve, or banada hunnúve ; either, it is suggested, because the trees of the forests (bana, vana) begin to seront at about this time, or because on this occasion there is another festival of the goddess Bnpasarı kari of the well-known temple near Bidami. The name of the now-moon has been diten to me as avartra-amavâse, dvatra-amavåss, and avaratri-anavâse; I have not succeeded in obtaining any explanation of the name, or even in determining the exact form of it. 
Mágha ; January-February... The fall-moon is usually called bharata-lunnuve, or sometimes bhârati-huņņuve; apparently in some connection either with the public reading of the Mahabharata, or with some worship of the goddess Bharati (Sarasvati). It appears. however, to be also known as guļi-hunnuve; because, it is said, the people imagine that on this day the gods go from the temples (gudi) to the houses of their worshippers, who, accordingly, welcome them during the night with shouts of “ the gods have come," and with the sounds of gongs and other musical instruments...- The new-moon is called sivaratri amayi.ge ; because just before it there is the well-known great festival called na ka-sivardtri in honour of the god Siva. In the twelfth century A.D., this new-moon was called kâman Amatase, the new-moon of Kâma" (see page 15 below); evidently in connection with the ensuing hôle-festival of Kamadeva, the god of love, which ends with the burning of an efigy of 
1 Kittel's Kannada-English Dictionary, s.v. ell19 would give this new-moon the newe of el!a-amaudse, with the explanation that the indies are worshipped on this day. The manes are vorsbipped with sesamu ilin seeds (ello), I thing. But ellq-amaodse is given to me, and correctly, I boliere as tho name of the new-moon of Mårgasiraba, 
I cannot verify this in auy way. And it seong more likely that the name has some connection with the ripening of the pous of the sige-slirub, which are used liko soap for washing the hair, etc. 
& As already remarked (note 1 above), Kittel's Kannada-Eoglish Dictionary, #.V. e! #, gives the yolla-amarela As the name of the new-moon of Bhadrapaila.

---- him in commemoration of his laving been reduced to asbes, by the flames from the third eye in the forolead of the god Siva, when he was trying to inspire Siva with love for Pårvati. 
Phålguna ; February-March. The full-moon is usually called hõļi-hunnuve; iu connec tion with the hubi-festiral, (see above, under Magha), which ends on this day. Kittel's Kannada-English Dictionary, s.v. lênia, gives it also the name of kâmana-hunnuve, “the full-moon of Káma; " is the same connection - The new-moon is called ugâdi-a muvâse, 2.0. yugândi-anavâse ; because the next day, Chaitra sukla 1; usually known as san utsara pratipadâ, --- is the commencement (údi) of the new year (yuga is here used in the scuse of siirratsare or varsha). 
Of epigraphic instances of the mention of special names of the full-moons and neve moons, four can be quoted, in addition to the reference to the nûla-hunnure in the present l'ecord : 
1.- An inscription at Balagiñve in Mysore (Puli, Sanskrit, and Old-Canarese Inscriptions No. 158 ; Mysore Inscriptions, p. 121) is dated -Sa(śn)ka-Farshada 976ueya Jaya-samvatsarada Vaisakha bahala akshaya-tri(tri)tiyad=amavâse Adivara-nimittam ;'on account of Sunday (coupled with) the now-inoon of the akshaya-tfitiya of the dark fortnight of Vaibikha of the Jaya samvatsara, which was the Saka year 976 (expired)." Here, à mistake was made, through carelessness on the part of the writer of the record, either in allotting the new-moon in question to Vaisåkla, instead of to Chaitra, or in allotting the akshaya-tritiya tithi to the dark fortuight, instead of to the bright fortnight, of Vaisakha; the text may be construed either way. As regards the results for the date, in the given year, the new-moon tithi of Chaitra ended, as required, on Sunday, 10th April, A, D 1054, at about 19 hours after meau sunrise ; whereas, the new-moon tithi of Vaišikha ended at about 6 hours on Tuesday, 10th May, and cannot be connected with a Sunday at all.? 
2. An inscription at Tadi-Målingi in Mysore is dated, according to the romanised text (Inscriptions in the Mysore District, Part I. p. 146, No. 31), Saka-varsada 1118neya Rakshasan samvatsarada yaksha-tadige Bihavåra sûryya-grahaņadalu ; " at an eclipse of the sun (01) Thursday coupled with) the aksha-tadige (new-moon) of the Rakshas2 samvatsard, which was the Saka year 1118 (current)," Here, according to this version of the text, the now-moon tithi is not expressly mentioned ; though the text in Kanarese characters indicates otherwise, having the curious and meaningless expression 'yalshatahela masa, instead of yaksila-tadige. But, however that may be, the mention of an eclipse of the sun shows that the now-moon tithi was meant ; not the alcshaya-tritiya tithi. And the new-moon tithi of Chaitra, in the given year, ended at about 3 hours after mean sunrise on Wednesday, 12th April, A.D. 1195; and on this day there was a total eclipse of the sun, perhaps visible in Southern India (sce Von Oppolzer's Canon der Finsternisse, pp. 230, 231, and Plate 115). This is, perhaps, not the given week-day. But the want of agreement between the romanised and Kanarese texts suggests that the original may not have been read correctly, and that the real reading may be Budhavára (Wednesday), not Biñarára (Thursday). 
3.- The Kargudari inscription (Ind. Ant. Vol. X. p. 249) is dated-śrímach-Chalukya Vikrama-yarshada 33neya Sarpvadhári-samvatsarada herjjuggiya-puņņami Sômapârad-andina subha-lagnado) ; " at an auspicious moment of Monday (coupled with) the herjuggi full-moon of the Sarvadhárin samvatsara, which was the 33rd (year) of the glorious Chiļuky&-Vikrapa varsha." Here, the given year is Saka-Satavat 1031 current. The mouth is not specified. And this full-moon name is not to be found in any of the lists given to me. But Mr. Venkat Rango Katti, of Dharwar,--- one of the gentlemen by whom the lists were made out for me 
KA 
? It may be added that on the 10th May there was a total eclipse of the gan, visible right across India (see Yon Oppolzer's Canon der Finsternisse, pp. 216, 217, and Plate 108), which one vould expect to find inentinnen in the record, if that were the date really intended. On the 10th April there was no eclipse,

informed me eventually (see loo. cit. p. 254, note 30) that, though the name is but rarely used "dow, herjuggi, or, in its modern form, bejjuggi, is at some places still known among the - Lingayat onltivators as another name of the sigi-huņņuve or full-moon of Âśvina ; and that “the esplanation is that on that day the cultivators prepare a huggi, or moss of boiled rice mixed * with split pnlse, salt, pepper, cummin seeds, etc., and, taking it to their fields, scatter it abroad 
in handfuls at every step (hejje)," And, as a matter of fact, the full-moon tithi of Âšvina, in the gifen year, did end, as required, on Monday, 21st September, A.D. 1108, at about 23 hrs. 48 min. after mean sunrise.'. Now, the above explanation of the name cannot be accepted ; for the reason that herje does not occar as the older form of lejje. But the true explanation can be established. In Lavarese, an initial s is liable to become in composition. We have a clear instance in the name of the perjunka or hejjuila tas, -- mentioned in many epigraphic records, which anquestionably comes from per, her, "large, great,' + sunila, " toll, doty, customs. On the analogy of this, Terjuggi is to be derived from per, her, to suggi, 'larvest time,' and is to be interpreted as meaning " the great or principal harvest." Thus, the herjuggi full-moon is the harvest moon. And this name exactly fits the Åsvina full-moon, next before the autumn barvest, when the muigari, klarij, or early crops, sown just before the commencement of the rains, are gathered.3 
4.-- An inscription at the temple of Virabhadra in the fort at Lakkuņdi in the Gadag tálaka, Dharvar district (I quote from an ink-impression), is dated - frinach-Châļukya Vikrama-Farshada 45neya Skryvarit eumvatsarada Mágha-masarla Kåman-amavâsye punga dinad-amda; "on the meritorious day (on the now-moon of Káma, of the month Micha of the Sárvarin samvatsara, which was the 45th (year) of the glorious Châļukya-Vikrama Varsha." Here, the given year is Saka-Samvat 1043 current. And the corresponding English dnte is the 19th February, A.D. 1121, when the full-moon tithi ended at about 2 hrs. 8 min. after mean sunrise. For the meaning of the name, see page 13 above.

It should, perhaps, be added that, in the given year, two other full-moon dithis ended on the given weekday, or the full-moon of Vaisakha, at about 4 hrs. 40 min, after mean surise ou Monday, 27th April, A.D. 1108, and the full-moon of Mågha, at about 16 hrs. 16 min. after mean suprise on Mondny, 18th January, A.D. 1109; also, tbat op those days, as on the day of the Âbviga full-moon, there was no lunar eclipse to be mentioned in the record ; also, that either of those two fall-woons might perhaps be connected with the spring harvest, when the hingdri, raði, or later crops, sowa in October and November, are gathered. But it seems to me that the autumn harrest is the more important one for the greater part of the Kagerese country, and that Mr. Venkat Rango Katti was rightly informed that the Rerjuggi full-moon in the foll-moon of Afring

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. After an invocation of Siva (line 1), and a verse in praise of the same god under the name of Sambho, the inscription proceeds to recite that, in the centre of the earth, there is the mountain Mandara (1.3), the ornament of the seven continents and the seven Oceans. Over the land of Kuntala (1.3), which was.considered to be a lock of hair (kuntala) of the woman who was the land to the south of the golden mountain (Meru), there reigoed the Chalukyas (1. 4), in 80 praiseworthy a manner as to illustrate well the observances of the code of Manu (1. 4). When they had continued daring eighteen successions, among the repowned Châļukyas (1. 5), in the eighteenth (succession), in the descent of the royal Chalukyas who claimed to be born in the lineage of the younger brother of the father of Kattiyaradêve (11. 5, 6)* whose hereditary capital was the world-renowned Kisuvoļal (1.5), there was king Ayyaņadēva (I.) (1,7). To him there was born Vikramaditya (V.) (1. 7), whose wife was Bonthâdôvi (1.8). daughter of king Lakshmana of the Dahalâ country. And then,- prosperity returning to the Chalki family, which had suffered mishap through being bruised by the race of the demons ja the shape of the Ratta kings (11. 8, 9),- their son was Taila (II.) (1. 10), a very incarnation of Krishna, who fought & hundred and eigh to battles out in the open country, and captured eighty-eight fortressed. None of the hostile kings could shake off this Åhavamalla-Taila (II.) (1. 12), who, resembling Death, sunibilated those kings, the pillars of Kakkars? (1. 12) in war, the moons of the sky which was the Rashtrakûça (race), and, amidst the applauses of the whole world, with an exceedingly great effort acqnired the sovereignty of the land of Kuntala (1. 13). Just 88 (the god) Sarasijaudhha (Vishnu), in the form of the primal boar, lifted up the earth which had sink into the lover regions, so Taila (II.) (1. 15), bearing the Grest of a boar, lifted up the Chalukya sovereignty which had fallen through being over

thrown by the Ratta kings. So this Nûrmadi-Taila (II.), otherwise called Traiļokyamalla? and Ahavamalla (11. 15, 16), became the lord of the whole earth; and, at the festival of his installation in the sovereignty, when his name, " the grindstone of the Rattas," began to fill the earth, he gave (the town of) Maņiñgavalļi, with libations of water, to Îśvaraghaļisasa, the Jagadguru or pontiff of the world, the sun of the water-lilies that are (the members of) the Harîta (gótra), who was considered to be the cause of the great growth of his sovereignty (11. 16, 17). And İśvaraghaļisasa, the leader of the family of the Haritas, whose feet were worshipped by king Taila (II.), the leader of the Chalukyas, gave the choice Manigavalli, in the Tardavâại thousand, to the five-hundred excellent Brahmins of whom be himself was the chief, as a grant to endure as long as the moon and san might last (11. 17-19). 
In the lineage of that lord (1. 19), there was a certain Madhava (1. 20), the Prabhu of the town of Manikyavalli, the very Vishna of the renowned Harita gótra. And now to describe the greatness of the fire-hundred Mahajanas (1. 20):- [Here come (II. 21-24) two verses in praise of the virtues and accomplishments of the five-hundred Brahmans of Mâạikyavaļli or Manimgavalți, followed by a repetition of the statement that Manigavalli was in the Tardavâdi thousand; and then we are told that] Among the five-lundred of Manigavaļļi, there sprang up a certain Govardhana (1. 25), the moon of the ocean that was the Kibyapa gótra, an excellent member of the race of Vâjins. His son was Rêvadasa (1. 26). The latter had four sons -- Någadeva, Vishna, Goyyarasa, and Hulidba 11. 27). The youngest of these became the greatest, and, under the name of Chandramas, made his reputation rench even as far as the Himalaya mountains. To that lord Chandiraja (1. 28) aud to Chandrâmbike there was born a son, Basava. There were none who were like him in devotion to the feet of (tho god) Mahêśvara (Siva); and this Basava (1. 30) attained the fame of being esteemed the sun that caused to bloom the water-lily that was the affection of the five-hundred Brahwaņs of Maniñgavaļļi. This Basavarasayya (1. 30) came to be considered the father of the world, since the whole world, putting their hands to their foreheads, saluted him with the words "Oar virtuoas father;" and thus he brought greatness to the famous Manigavaļļi. Manifesting the height of graciousness in saying " This is the abode of the essence of the three Vêdas; this is the accomplishment of that which has no end and no beginning; this is the lustrous divine linga” (1. 31), he caused to be made for the beautiful (god) Kalidêvôća (1. 32) a dwelling-place, the abode of the joy of mankind, which gathered together in itself all the fame of his lineage. Saying "Basava made this beautiful abode, in such a style that it surpasses the silver mountain (Kailasa); the excellent Brahmans of Manigavalli are full of devotion, so as to rival Kubera ; I will abide here always," the great lord Kalidêva (1. 33) approved of the abode. And so this glorious pleasure-house of Kalidôvéśa (1. 35), the chief beauty of the world, shall be charming for ever. 
Hail! (1. 35). While the asylum of the universe, the favourite of fortune and of the earth, the Maharajadhiraja, the Pariméécara, the Paramabhaftáraka. the glory of the family of Satyasraya, the ornament of the Châļukyas, the glorious and valorous emperor Jagadėkamalladêva (II.)

C.Of the time of Sankama; A.D. 1178. The writing of the whole record covers an area about 1' 113" broad by 2' 11" high. The tablet, however, is broken into four pieces, of which one, containing portions of lines 15 to 25, has been lost. In addition to this, many of the letters in the two extant upper fragments, which extend as far as line 23, are a good deal obliterated. And it has, therefore, been found convenient to reproduce the text from line 24 only, from which point it is all on one fragment of the stone and in a state of much better preservation; giving, in the abstract of contents, the substance of lines 1 to 23, which can be read quite sufficiently for that purpose, though they cannot be edited in full. The sculptures at the top of the tablet are, in the centre, & linga, with the sun and moon above it; on the proper right, a squatting figure, facing full-front; and on the proper left, a cow and calf. The characters are Kanarese, of the regular type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well formed and boldly executed. They include decimal @gures in line 25, and the distinct form of the lingual d: the viráma is represented by the sign for the vowel 4, throughout; and pointed instances of this are śrematu, line 24, and partthivémdraitu, line 41. The average size of the letters is about "...The language is Kanarese ; there are ordinary verses in lines 10 to 24, and some, of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses in lines 40 to 46. The accusative peuter singular occurs both with the archaic 9%, e.g. dhanaman, line 33, and with the v, e.g. dharınmavainz, l. 38, where, from the use of the anusvára before the n, we seem further to have exactly the modern form, dharmavannw.- In respect of Orthography we need only notice an occasional confusion of the sibilants, illustrated by varsada, line 24, and sudhdha, line 25. 
The inscription is a record of the time of the Kalachurya king Sankams. And it registers grants that were made, by the direction of the king himself, to the Mahájanas or Brâhmans of Mañigavalli, headed by the Maháprabhu lávaradêra, and to some other persons. 
It is dated at the time of the Dakshiņâyana-samkranti or summer solstice, coupled with Sunday and the eleventh tithi of the bright fortnight of the month Ashâdha, of the Viļambin samoatsara, which was the third year of the reign of Sankama. But the date does not work out correctly. The given sainvatsara vas Saka-Samyat 1101 current. And the given tithi euded, not on a Sunday, but on Tuesday, 27th June, A.D. 1178, at about 14 hrs. 34 min. after mean sunrige; while the samkránti also, which occurred on the preceding day, Monday, at about 18 hrs. 58 min., cannot be connected in any way with the Sunday.

of the incarnation of the same god as & boar. It then refers itself to the time 0 the asylam of the universe (11. 2, 3), the favourite of fortune and of the earth, the Mahari/12 dhiraja and Paraméšvara, the supreme lord of Kalañjara the best of towns, he who had a banner of a golden Garuda (1. 4), he who was heralded in public by the sounds of 11 musical instrument called dameriga, the sun of the water-lilies of the Kaļachurya family (11. 4, 5), he who was successful (Buen) on a Saturday (1.6), the champion against hill-forts, 1110 Kalachurya-bhujabala-Chakravartin, the glorious Sankamadêvaraga (1.8), whose victorio115 reign file continuing, witha perpetual increase, so as to endure as long as the moon and Sun and stars might last, at the nelevidu of Navile (1.9), with the pleasure of an agreeable or friendly interchange of communications (with his feudatories) (11. 9, 10). He who subsisted (like a bee) on the water-lilies that were his feet, was the Dandadhipa Kesava (1. 12). The Mahdprabhu of Maņingavalli (1.16) was Išvaradêva. His son (1. 18), a very moon of the ocean of the Harita family, was the Prabhu Madiraja (1. 19), whose virtues are praineri in the next few lines, with another mention of Maşimgavalți in line 23. 
On account of the festival of the sun's commencement of his progress to the soutli (on) Sunday, (coupled with) the eleventh tithi of (the month) Âghadha of the Vilambin samvatsara, which was the third of the years of the Kalachurya emperor Sanka inadáv, (11. 24, 25), at the command of the emperor,-- the Dandanayaka Kêsimayya (1. 26), 16 very Narayana among leaders of the forces, and his nephew the Mahápradhana and Damer pâyaka Brahmadêva (1. 27), and the Hergade of the latter, Mattarasa, gave the following religious grants to all the Vahajanas, headed by the Maháprabhu Ié varudêva, of the agrahidrei af Manigavalli (1. 28) which was the seat of their authority, and to the Maligas (1. 29) and to Lu c 
of the five mathas, and to all the people, and to all the castes; namely,' at Maņigavalli (1. 30), if any one should die without song, his wife, female children, divided parents and brothers and their children. o . . . . . . ,L101 910 kinsmen and relatives of the game gôtra, who might survive, should take possession of all his property, such as bipeds, quadrapeds, coin, grain, house, and fields; and, if none sierly should survive, (the authorities of the village) should make over that property, as a religione graat, to those who hold the grants of the gods. And they gave, as & sarvanamasya-gril, Errents mattars (of land), (by the measure) of the large staff, to the god Shambikêśvara (1. :7.4.), in order to do worship after proclaiming the aindra-festivals and making Brâhmans ruut Tho are versed in the Vedas; this they gave with libations of water, saying that . . . . ... should not be said in the houses of Brahmaụs. 
The record then ends (ll. 36 to 46), with a mandate to the Adhikarira, the Karana, tu Prablı, the Mahajanas, and all the people, to maintain these grants, and with five of tirti customary benedictive and imprecatory verges. 
D. Of the time of Jaitugi L; about A.D. 1200. The writing covers an area about 2'6" broad by 2' 3" high. It is mostly in a state of ving good preservation. But, from half-way through line 29, all the formal part of the record is been broken away and lost. The sculptures above it, at the top of the tablet, are, towary the proper right, a linga, with the sun and moon above it, and a standing figure on each sid, it; and towards the proper left, a cow and calf.-- The characters are Kanarese, of the recruiu type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well formed and well exeans throughout.

precedes it by a blank space about four inches high; and, though written apparently by the same hand, it was probably put on the stone at a subsequent time. The characters include the distinct form of the lingaald all through. The viráma is represented by the sign for the vowel u and pointed instances of this occur in pogabaluke, line 15, and chanchadu-brdhmya, line 22. The size of the letters ranges from about f'to 1"-The language is Kanarese ; and lines 1 to 26 are all in verse, with a few short connecting prose links. The accusative singular neuter in v occurs in pradésavan, line 18. In lines 12, 13, we have two rather peculiar or unusual words; kharvada, = kharvata, karvata, which apparently means ' a market-town;' and madambe which I do not find in any dictionary, but which must denote some other kind of village. In respect of orthography we may notice (1) the use of ri for ri, throughout; (2) the use of 8 for v in Braja, line 9, sébyan, line 15, and bratiśvaran, line 25; (3) the use of v for b in dôrvoala, line 5; (4) & good deal of confusion between the sibilants, illustrated by visayan, line 14, šasi, line 17, and sisyan, line 25; and (5) the doubling of t before y very exceptional at so late a period. - in apattya, line 25. 
The inscription is a record of the time of the Dêvagiri-Yadava king Jaitugi I. The introductory portion of it is complete. But the formal part, containing the date and the details of the grants that were recorded in it, has been brokon away and lost.

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. The record opens with invocations of the god Visbņu as the boar (line 1), and as Sårigin (11.3, 4). It then refers itself to the time of the Bhujabala-chakravartin Bijjaladva (1. 10), the Mahdrajadhiraja who had attained the pañchamahasabda (1.4); the supreme lorit of Kalajara, the best of towns (1. 5); he who had the banner of a golden Garuda ; be who was heralded in public by the sounds of the musical instrument called damaruga (11. 5, 6); the sun of the water-lily that was the Kalachurya family (1. 6),-- who was reigning at the capital of Kalyana (1. 10) with the pleasure of an agreeable or friendly interchange of communications (with his feudatories) (1.11). 
All the Mahüjaras, headed by Madiraja (1. 14), the Prabhu of the agrahára of Mani gavalli, and the Karanas, headed by the Mahápradháng and Dandaniyaka Ammaņayya (1. 15),- for the angabhôga, and for the repairs of whatever might become broken, torn, or worn-out, of (the god) Channa-Kéśava (1. 17), which had been established by Dangeya Vasudevanayaka (1. 16),- on account of the vyatipâta of an eclipse of the sun (1. 20) (on) Sunday (coupled withy the new-moon tithi of the month) Margasira of the Parthiva samvatsare which was the tenth year of the Kalachurya emperor Bijjaladêvs (1. 18), gave & plot of cultivable land (1. 20) on the west of the road to Ukkali” (1l. 20, 21), on the north of the cultivable land called Tupparaju-geyri, on the east of the road to (P) Ralakkiyabbeya-Hañchike, and on the south of the cultivable land called Harekâja-geyyi. (And) Dangeya-Singarasa and Dangay. Våsudevanayaka (1. 23) allotted twelve mattara, (by the measure) of the big staff, as a sarvamamasya-grant, in the site of their ....... 8 allotment.

C.--. Of the tinie of Sankama; A.D. 1178. The writing of the whole record covers an area about l'117" broad by 2' 11" high. The tablet, however, is broken into four pieces, of which one, containing portions of lines 15 to 25, has been lost. In addition to this, many of the letters in the two extant upper fragments, which extend as far as line 23, are a good deal obliterated. And it has, therefore, been found congenient to reproduce the text from line 24 only, from which point it is all on one fragment of the stone and in a state of much better preservation; giving, in the abstract of contents, the substance of lines 1 to 23, which can be read quite sufficiently for that purpose, though they cannot be edited in full... The sculptures at the top of the tablet are, in the centre, a linga, with the sun and moon above it; on the proper right, & squatting figure, facing full-front; and on the proper left, a Cow and calf -- The characters are Kanarese, of the regular type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well formed and boldly executed. They include decimal figures in line 25, and the distinct form of the lingual d: the viráma is represented by the sign for the powel ut, throughout; and pointed instances of this &re śrīmata, line 24, and pártt hivendrómu, line 41. The average size of the letters is about " -The language is Kanarese; there are ordinary verses in lines 10 to 24, and some of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses in lines 40 to 46. The accusative neuter singular occurs both with the archaic m, e.g. dhanaman, line 33, and with the v, e.g. dharmmavamnă, 1. 38, where, from the use of the anustára before the n, we seem further to have exactly the modern form, dharmavan... In respect of Orthography we need only notice an occasional confusion of the sibilants, illustrated by varsada, line 24, and sudhdhag line 25. 
The inscription is a record of the time of the Kalachurya king Sankam.. And it registers grants that were made, by the direction of the king himself, to the Mahajanas or Brahmans of Manigavalli, beaded by the Mahaprablu Isvaradeva, and to some other persons. 
It is dated at the time of the Dakshiņâyana-sankranti or summer solstice, coupled with Sunday and the eleventh tithi of the bright fortnight of the month Ashâdha, of the Viļambin samvatsard, which was the third year of the reign of Sankama. But the date does not work out correctly. The given samvatsara was Saka-Samyat 1101 current. And the given tithi ended, not on a Sunday, but on Tuesday, 27th June, A.D. 1178, at about 14 hrs. 34 min. after mean sunrise; while the sankranti also, which occurred on the preceding day, Monday, at about 18 hrs, 58 min., cannot be connected in any way with the Sunday.

of the incarnation of the same god as & boar. It then refers itself to the time of the asylum of the universe (II. 2, 3), the favourite of fortune and of the earth, the Maharajům Zbirdja and Parameswara, the gapreme lord of Kalañjara the best of towns, he who had the banner of a golden Garuda (1. 4), he who was heralded in public by the sounds of the musical instrument called damaruga, the sun of the water-lilies of the Kalachurya family (11. 4, 5), he who was successful (even) on a Satıurday (1. 6), the champion against hill-forts, tho Kalachurya-bhujabala-Chakravartin, the glorions Sankamadôverasa (1.8), whose victorious reign was continuing, with perpetual increase, so as to endure as long as the moon and sun and stars might last, at the nelevidu of Navile (1.9), with the pleasure of an agreeable or friendly interchange of communications (with his feudatories) (11. 9, 10). He who subsisted (like a bue) on the water-lilies that were his feet, was the Dandadhipa Kôšava (1.12). The Muháprabhu of Manimgavalli (1. 16) was Isyaradêra. His son (1. 18), a very moon of the ocean of the Earîta family, was the Prabhu Mâdiraja (1. 19), whose virtues are praised in the next few lines, with another mention of Maņingavalli in line 23. 
On account of the festival of the sun's commencement of his progress to the south (on) Sunday, (coupled with) the eleventh tithi of (the month) Âshadha of the Vilambin SALOyatsara, which was the third of the years of the Kalachurys emperor Sankamadêva, (1l. 2:, 25), at the command of the emperor, the Dandanayaka Kesimayya (1. 26), & Very Narậyaņa among leaders of the forces, and his nephew the Mahápradhôna and Danda mauako Brahmadêya (1. 27), and the Hergade of the latter, Mattarasa, gave the following religious grants to all the Mahajanas, headed by the Maháprabhu lśvaradeva, of the agrahira of Manigavalli (1.28) which was the seat of their authority, and to the Maligas (1. 29) and to .. o. o. of the five mathas, and to all the people, and to all the castes ; namely, at Marigavalli (1. 30), if any one should die without sons, his wife, female children, divided parents and brothers and their children, ...... ., and quy kimsmen and relatives of the same gôtra, who might survive, should take possession of all his property, such as bipeds, quadrupeda, coin, grain, house, and fields; and, if none such should service, (the authorities of the village) should make over that property, as a religious grant, to those who bold the grants of the gods. And they gave, as & sarvanamasya-grant, twenty mattars (of land), (by the measure) of the large staff, to the god Shambikêśvara (1. 34), in order to do worship after proclaiming the qindra-festivals and making Brahmans read who are versed in the Vedas; this they gave with libations of water, saying that . . . . 
.. should not be said in the houses of Brahmans. 
The record then ends (1l. 36 to 46), with a mandate to the Adhikariia, the Karana, the Prabh26, the Mahajanas, and all the people, to maintain these grants, and with five of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses. 
D... Of the time of Jaitugi I.; about A.D. 1200. The Writing covers an area about 2 6" broad by 2' 3" high. It is mostly in a state of yery good preservation. But, from half-way through line 29, all the formal part of the record has been broken away and lost. The sculptures above it, at the top of the tablet, are, towards the propor right, a linga, with the sun and moon above it, and a standing figure on each side of it; and towards the proper left, a cow and cell. The characters are Kanarese, of the rentar type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well formed and well eventer throughout. The formal part of the record, commencing with line 27, is separated from what 
? I am indebted to lír. Krishna Sastri for some assistance in interpreting the following passages, 
Apparently, some festival on " the eighth day in the second half of the month Margasiraba, and of the month Pausha " (Beo Mopier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary, , . aind").

precedes it by a blank space about four inches high; and, though written apparentig by the same band, it was probably put on the stone at a subsequent time. The characters include the distinct form of the lingual d all through. The viráma is represented by the sign for the vowel U and pointed instances of this occur in pogaļaluke, line 15, and chanchada-brâhnya, line 22. The size of the letters ranges from about "to ", — The language is Kanarose ; and lines 1 to 26 are all in verse, with a few short connecting prose links. The accusative singalar neuter in v occurs in pradésavan, line 18. In lines 12, 13, we have two rather peculiar or unusual words; kharvada, = kharvata, karvata, which apparently means a market-town;' and maçamba which I do not find in any dictionary, but which must denote some other kind of village. In respect of orthography we may notice (1) the use of ri for ri, throughout; (2) the use of b for v in braja, line 9, sébyan, line 15, and bratitvaran, line 25; (3) the use of v for b in dörvvala, line 5; (4) a good deal of confusion between the sibilanta, Jlustrated by visayan, line 14, sasi, line 17, and sisyan, line 25; and (5) the doubling of + tafore y, very exceptional at so late a period, -- in apattya, line 25. 
The inscription is a record of the time of the Dêvagiri-Yadava king Jaitugi I. The introductory portion of it is completa. But the formal part, containing the date and the details of the grants that were recorded in it, has been broken away and lost.

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. The inscription opens with a verse, occurring also in A., which mentions the mountain Mandara (line 2). It then mentions Jambüdyipa, or the central division of the world (1. 3); and then, again, the mountain Mandara, to the south of which there is the land of Bharatakshetra or India, in which there is the country of Kuntala (1. 4). The ruler of that country, born in the race of Yadu (1. 5), tas Bhillama (1. 6). And his son was Jaitugidêva (I.) (11. 6. 7), also called Jaitapaļa (1. 7), who conquered the Gurjaras, the Pândyas, and the Cholas, and the countries of Lâļa (Lata) and Gaula (Gauda, part of Bengal). One of Jaitugi's officers as the Dandanlathu Sahadeva (1. 8), who defeated the leaders of the forces of Mâlava, Kalinga, and Pâñchâļaka (1.9), of the Turushkas, and of Nepálaka. And Sahadeva's elder brother was Mallideva (1. 11), who also held the post of Dandésa (1. 12) or Dandanátha. His authority appears to have been limited to the district kuori as the Taddavâại thousand (II, 14, 15). In that district there was the town of Maņigavalli (1. 15) or Manimgavalli (1. 17), which Isvaraghaļisasa, of the Harita, family, had presented to the five-hundred Brâhmans (1. 16). And the Maháprabhu of that town was Isyaradêra (1. 17), son of Mâdiraja, a very moon of the ocean that was the Harita family (1. 18). The record then mentions a Prabhu of the town of Mâņikyavalli (1. 20) named Madhaya, of the Harita gôtra,— evidently identical with the Prabhu Madiraja, sou of Isvaradeva, who is mentioned in C. line 19, though the verse used to describe him here is that which in 4.., lines 19, 20, is applied to his grandfather Madhava or Madiraja, the father of Isyaradêva. It then proceeds to recite the virtues and accomplishments of the five-hundred Mahájanas or Brâhmans of Mâņikyavalli or Manimgavalli (11. 20 to 24). And this part of it concludes by telling us that, in the lineage of the Achåruas, there was a certain Gauludára (1.25); his chief disciple was Malayaļa-Jõânarási, and the son of the latter was Dharmarasi (1. 26). 
The formal part of the record commences with line 27. The name of the king, in line 25, is almost quite illegible. But he is described as belonging to the Yadava family (1l. 27, 28). And the superscript i near the end of line 28, clearly discernible in part and at just the place where it should be, enables us to recognise that the inscription is a record of the time of Jaitugi I. himself, not of one of his vaccessors, 
No. 4.--FOUR PILLAR INSORIPTIONS OF EASTERN: CHALUKYA CHIEFS AT SRIKURMAM. 
BY E. Holtzsch, PH.D. The Vishnu temple of Kurmêsvara at Srikûrmam near Chicacole in the Gañjam district contains many inscribed pillars of hard black stone, which have successfully withstood the influence of the climate. Most of their inscriptions are consequently in much better preservation than other stone records in the Telugu country. Four of the pillars bear the subjoined four inscriptions of three chiefs who profess to have been descendants of the Eastern Chalukya king Vimaladitya (A.D. 1015 to 1022) (A. verse 1) and of his son Râjaraja (A.D. 1022 to 1063). This king resided in Rajamahendrapattana (A. 7. 4) and is said to have translated with the help of scholars the history of the Bhârsta race into Telugu (ibid 7. 3). Here we have an important epigraphical confirmation of the tradition according to which Nannayabbatta, the first Telugu translator of the Mahabharata, wrote his work at the direction of Rajazâja of Rajamahêndri.!

A descendant of this Rajaraja was Vijayaditya (I.) (A, V. 6). The latter had a sun named Rå jaråja, who was the minister of Viransisimha (A. V, 7). This Rajaraja hal two sons, viz. Vijayaditya (II.) (A. v. 9) or Vijayarka (D. v. 1) and Purushôttama (B. 1. 1, and D. v. 2). Purushottama's son, Jagannatha or Višvanátha, was a vassal of Virabânudéva (C. 11. 11 to 15). For Vijayaditya II. we have the date Saka-Sańvat 1195 (A.), for Purushóttamu Saka-Samyat 1199 (B.) and 1240 (D.), and for Jagannatha Suka-Samvat 1231 (C.). Consequently king Viraprisimha whom Rajaraja, the father of Vijayâditya II., served as minister (A. v.7), has to be identified with the Ganga king Viranarasimha I., whose reign ended 18 years before that of his grandson Viranarasimha II., the 21st year of whose reign corresponded to Saka Sunnvat 1217. Vira båņudêya, the sovereign of Jagannatha or Viśvanátha, is identical with the Ganga king Virabhânudêva II., the successor of Viranarasitha II. 
The alphabet of the four inscriptions is Telugu. The language of A. and D. is Sanskrit verse, and that of B. and O. Sanskrit verse and Telugu prose. .. records that Vijayaditya (II.) granted twenty-five cows, the milk of which had to be usod for ghee to feed a lamp in the temple. B. contains a similar grant of fifty-two3 ewes for a lamp by Purushottama. 
C. consists of 49 lines, of which I am publishing only lines 1 to 16 and 28 to 30, omitting two passages in Telugu prose, which enumerate various offerings and the persons among whom they were distributed, and one imprecatory verse (sva-dattan etc., 1. 47 f.). The inscription records a grant of 40 half-pagodas (mishka, 1. 4 f., or gandamada, 1. 28) by Visvanatha for providing offerings to the god. D. was composed by the poet Nrisiriha (1. 6 f.) and states that Purushottama granted & golden necklace to the god,

[CHBDI-]SAMVAT 392. 
By G. BÜHLER, PR.D., LL.D., O.I.E. I here re-edit the two inscriptions of the Gurjara chief Dadda IV.,' which Frere discovered in 1895 by Mr. Vithal Nagar of Baroda. At my request, Dr. Hultzsch obtained this originals from the owner, Dhed Narayan of Sankhede in the Baroda division, through the kind offices of Colonel N. O. Martelli, Agent to the Governor General at Baroda. Dr. Hultzsch's impressions yield some better readings, among which however only one, kudira for vihira (No. II. 1. 11) affecta the sense. The grants, which have been drawn up on the same day, by the same writer, and in favour of the same person, are written each on two plates, showing, as is tisual in Gurjara dsanas, each two holes for the (now lost) rings. The plates of No. I. measure 10 inches by 54, and those of No. II. 10 inches by 6. 
The Characters show the western variety of the southern alphabets, which is found regularly in the inscriptions of the kings of Valabhi, of the Gurjarse of Broach, of their BOCOBBBors, the R&thors, and of some other dynasties. As might be expected, they agree in particular very closely with the Kheds grants10 of the same Dadda, written in (Chedi.) Samrat 380 and 385 by the same writer, with which they share the use of the characteristic little buttons at the tops of the vertical strokes. Nevertheless there are small differences in some letters, which extend even to these two new docaments, where 0.g. the medial 1 of No. I. doce not agree with that of No. II. Mach greater and more important variations appear in the

Valabhi sasaras, stated to have been written by the same writer, as may be seen from a comparison of those drawn up by the divirapati Skandabhata. Among the signs of interpunctuation we find, besides single and double vertical strokes, a single dot, e.g. after osimni (No. I. 1. 10) and after sandhys=cha (No. I. 1. 13), as well as a double point, looking like a risarga, after vatarpikshas-chu (No. II. 1. 11). The language, except in the imprecatory Ferses from the Mahibhirata, is good Sanskrit prose, and the orthographical and clerical mistakes are very few. 
The form of the two grants, likewise, closely agrees with that of the Khêđâ sâsanas, differing chiefly by the shortness of the Prašasti. While the Khêdî grants contain, in accordance with the rules of the Senpiti, descriptions of three generations of princes, the new inscriptions offer only the eulogy of the donor. This, of course, is literally identical in the four documents. In the technical parts of the foar inscriptions there are only small verbal differences, which, however, extend even to the-two Sankhedâ ślsanas. Though they do not ciffect the general meaning, they are very instructive for the manner in which the clerks of ancient India worked. These men apparently cared for exactness not more than the modern Karkups, since we see bere that the same writer, though working according to an older office copy, permitted himself to introduce small changes in two documents which he drafted on the same day, 
The object of the grants is to convey two fields, one at Suvarnárapalli (No. I.) and one at Kshirasara (No. II.) in the Samgamakhêtaka-vishaya, to the Brahman Sürya for the purpose of defraying the expense of his sacrifices. The gain from these inscriptions for the history of the Gurjaras of Broach is but small. Their date, the full-moon day of Vaisakha of (Chedi-) Samvat 392, shows, however, that Dadda IV. Prašântarâga ruled at least until A.D. 841-2, and that the Sankhédå grant of (Chedi-) Samyat 391 was really issued during Dadda's reign as Mr. Dhruva conjectured. Its grantor, Raņagraha, the son of Vitaraga, whom Mr. Dhruvs rightly considers to be a brother of our Dadda, probawly held some villages as his gris. Further, the two inscriptions show that the territory of the Gurjaras extended up to the frontiers of Khandesh and Málya. For the town, after which the Sangamakhêțaka-vishaya was named, is undoubtedly the modern Sankhada. Samgamakhêtaka means etymologically the village at the confluence (of two rivers),' and the Unchh and the Or* join near Sankhedi. The vishaya or province of Sargamakhêtaka probably included the Sankhéđá Prånt of the Gaikôvåd's possessions, as well as the neighbouring portion of the Rêvåkinthå Agency, still called Sankheďå Môvåg. The partial identity of the names of the two districts indicates that they once belonged to a larger province, the capital of which was Sankhédâ. As the Trigonometrical Survey maps of these districts are not accessible to me, I am unable to fully prove these assertions by the identification of the villages of Atavipataka, Kukkutavallika, Kshirasara and Suvarnarapalli, mentioned in the two grants.

Dasarpiura is mentioned in the spurious grant of Dharasena II., dated Saka-Satarat 400, and il member of the Britiman caste of Daśapura (Daślepura-ñáii) composed the Chitorgadh inscription of Môkala of Merad. Aí prosent Dasapuriyas are not found in Gajariit. 
The writer of the grant, the sandhivigranilo Rêve, is known from the Khedà grants. The name of the distula, Karka, in No. 11. line 27, is ner. His title, bhôgikapálaļa, literally the protector of the bhôgikus or village proprietors,' the technical naning of which is not known to me, occurs also in the Sankhid) grant of Samvat 391, where in line 9 the facsimile ha dútakú=tra bhôgikapalaka-Dujdna, and not, as Mr. Dhruva reads, bhôngika-Pálakafu-jitâng.

No. 6.-EIGHT VATTELUTTU INSCRIPTIONS OF CHOLA KINGS. 
By E. Hultzsch, PH.D. Professor Bühler in his Indian Palæography (p. 72 f. of the German edition) and Mr. Venkayya in his paper on the Kottayam plate of Vira-Raghava (above, Vol. IV. p. 293) have lately urged the necessity of publishing Vatteluttu inscriptions, the dates, of which can be fixed with some certainty. Hence I take this opportunity for issuing mechanical copies of eight Chôļa inscriptions. None of these is in & condition of complete preservation; but I trust that, even in their necessarily imperfect state, the accompanying facsimiles will prove useful for tracing the development of the Vatteluttu alphabet. 
Five of the inscriptions (A. to E.) are engraved on two boulders in the Sthåņunaths temple at Suchindram between Köttáru and Cape Comorin in the Travancore State, and the remaining three (F. to H.) on the north wall of the shrine in the Râmnsvåmin temple at Shermadêvi in the Tinnevelly district: They belong to the reigns of the Chola kings

Parakeaarivarmuu (A.), Parintaka I. (B.), Kajaraja I. (0. to G.) and Rajendra-Onộla I. (11.). The fact that all those inscriptions are found in the extreme south of the peninsula proves, what the Vatteluttu inscriptions of the earlieu Pandya kings suggest, that, about the 10th century of our 012, the Vatteluttu was current iu the country of tña Paņdyas, but unknown in the native territory oi thair Chola conquerors. 
The characters of the subjoined inscriptions agree more closely with ihose of the Cochin and Tirunelli platest than with those of the plates of Jatilaparman. Throughout F., G. and H. once in C. and twice in D. occurs a variant of y, which is kuown from the Köttayam plates of Sthânu-Ravi.11 11. she double k is written as a group, as in many inscriptions in the Tamil alphabet. As in all other Vatteļuttu inscriptions, Grantha letters are occasionally used in the subjoined eight records. The following is list of the Grantha words and letters - 
Svasti fri at the beginning of each of the eight inscriptions.-- A., 1.11, sabhab..0., 1. 4, brahma; I. 5, llahêle; 1. 11, tablai..-D., 11., and 6, ja of Rújouruja ; 1. 7£., brahma and 76 of brahmudêyam, and Sajentira.-- E., l. &, brahmuld and mah[ *]sabhoi -- T., 11. 3 and 4, Rújarája ; 1. 4 f., brahma, mane and chcluturore. --- E., 1.1, sri and jentru of sri-Rújéndriv, ju of Erdjarúja ; l. 2, brahina; 11. 2, 8 and 9, sc of Varanasu ; ll. ő and G, sri.

A... Inscription in the Sthâņunátha temple at Suchin drin, This inscription records the gift of a lamp to the sira temple at Tiruchchivindiram, the modern Suchindram, and is dated in the 34th year of the reign of the ancient Chola king Parakesarivarman.? As we know from the largo Leyden grant and frona actual examples in the history of the later Cholas that the titles Rijakesarin and Parakesarin wero bordo alternately by reiguing kings, some of those inscriptions which are daled in the reign of Parakesarivarman--without any distinguishing epithet, as Hadirat-konda in the case of Parântaka I.,_ may perhaps be attributed to Vijayalaya, the grandfather of Parka taka I. and the earliest historical person that is referred to in two genealogical inscriptions of the Chola dynasty.

* No.8% of the Government Epigraphist's collection for 1896. 
An inscription of the same year is noticed in South Ind. Inscr. Vol. II. p. 374 and note 8. * See ind. p. 879 and note 8. 
• The same place is inentioned in two Pindya inscriptions ; Ind. Ant. Vol. XXII. pp. 67 and 74. 
7 As stated in South-Ind. Insor, Vol. II, p. 132, note 3, onda-viļakker or nauda-ridalk are corruption of murid-pilakku, which occurs in H., line 4, and in an inscription at Tirukkalukkunni(aborc, lol. III. p. 284). The fona tiri nondd-vilakku in the present ingcription further suggests that tiri-punda-vilakku, "A suured lamp which is dover trimmed,' has been developed by folk etymology from tiri-nunddovilakku, a lamp the wiek of plloh is never triunwed' (because ghee is continually supplied to it). 
EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
(VOL. . 
(lamp) might barn without fail, as long as the moon and the sun exist, daring day and nights (one) ubablou and a half of ghee per day, (he) granted seventy-five full-grown ewes, which must neither die nor grow old. For one (other) perpetual lamp, which the same person gave to the shrine of) Tirupêngada nilai), (he) granted twenty-five evès, in order that (this lamp) might baril, in the same manner as stated above, (one) aldkku% of ghee per day.

C.- Inscription in the Sthåņunátha temple at Suchindram. This inscription records the gift of a lamp by a native of Ceylon (119-zâdu) io the 10th year of the reign of the Choļa king Rajaranja I., who ascended the throne in A.D. 985.

TRANSLATION Hail! Prosperity! In the tenth year (of the reign) of king Rajaraja-Kosarivarman, in the month of Karkataka with which (this) year began, Mala[varaiya)n (Se]g[oi] Ka[nda]. of [ÎJla-nadu gave to the temple of) Mahadeva at Tiruchchiyindiram, a brahmadéya in Nâñji nâţu, one sacred perpetual lamp, to burn without fail during night and day, as long as the moon and the sun exist, (one) wakku of ghes per day. For this (lamp he) gave fifty full-grown ewes, which must neither die nor grow old. These (eues) were shown and made over to the chief members of the assembly. And (by) the chief members of the assembly they were entrusted (?), shown and made over to [Pa]dait[tarıma]n Kaņaisya]n of (Vjettirkadi, a village belonging to the temple of ) Emberaman (Visbņu). 
D.com Inscription in the Sthanunatha temple at Suchindram.o This inscription is dated in the 14th year of the reign of the same king as the preceding inscription. Its purport is doubtful owing to the bad preservation of lines 14 to 24, of which I am unable to publish a transcript and translation.

H.-- Inscription in the Râmasvárein templo at Shermådévi.. This inscription is dated in the 3rd year of the reign of the Chola king Rájëndra-Chola I., who ascended the throne in A.D. 1001-23 It records that certain Vaikhanasas pledged themselves to supply daily one half of the amount of ghee that was necessary to keep one lump burning in the temple, which bore the name Nigarili-Sòla-Vinnagar. Shörmidêvi itseif hud theu the surname Nigarili-soja-chaturvedimasgalam. These two surnames suggest that Nigarili-Solan, i.e. the unequalled Chola,' was a birula of Rajendra-Chola I.

" In the year fifteon (of the reign) of king Rajaraja-Kesarivarman -- on the day of Parva-Bhadrapadê, which corresponded to a Tuesday, three evenings having expired of the month of Kanyá in this year." 
We have found before (above, Vol. IV. p. 266) that Rajaraja's reign commenced between the 24th December A.D. 984 and the 26th September A.D. 985. A date of the month of Kanya (August September) of the 15th year of his reign, therefore, will be expected to fall either ia A.D, 999, in Saka-Samvat 921 expired, or in A.D. 1000, in Saka-Samvat 922 expired. As a matter of fact, this new date works out correctly for Saka-Samvat 921 expired. 
In Sake-Samvat 921 expired the month of Kanyà lasted from the 27th August to the 25th September A.D. 999, and during this period the moon pas in the nakshatra Pûrya Bhadrapadá by the equal-space system for 15 h. 6 m., by the Brahme-siddhanta for 3 h 56 m., and according to Garga for 3 h. 17 m., after mean sunrise-- on Tuesday, the 29th August A.D. 999, which was the third day of the month of Kapyat (and the full-moon days of the month of Bhadra pada). 
The date reduces the period daring which the reign of Rajaraja must have commenced to the time from the 24th December A.D. 984 to (approximately) the agth August A.D. 986.6

“In the 48th year (of the reign) of king Rajakesarivarman, alias the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Kulôttunga-Choladôra- on the day of Årdrå, which corresponded to a Monday and to the thirteenth titha of the first fortnight of the month of Makara." 
Above, Vol. IV. p. 263, we have seen that a day in the month of Kumbha of the 48th year of the reign of Kulôttunga-Chöln I. Corresponds to the 25th Jangary A.D. 1118. This date, of the month of Makara which imniediately precedes the month of Kumbha, of the same 48th year, will therefore be expected to fall within a month before the 23rd January A.D. 1118, the first day of the month of Kambha of that other date. And so it really does. T'or, the date corresponde to Monday, the 7th January A.D. 1118, when the 13th tithi of the bright half of the month Maghal) ended 15 h. 1 m., and when the natshatra was Årdrâ, by the Equal-space system for 14 h. 27 m., by the Brahma-siddhanta for 0 h. 39 n., and according to Garga for 2 h. 38 m., after mean sunrise.

No. 8.-RAYAKOTA PLATES OF SKANDASISHYA. 
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.D. This inscription is edited from two sets of Sir Walter Elliot's ink-impressions, which I owe to the kindness of Dr. Fleet. On the wrapper in which I roceived the impressions are the following remarks in Dr. Fleet's hand:-- "The original copper-plates bolong to Sir Walter Elliot. Three plates, about 82" by 37". In good order. They are quite smooth; the edges are not raised into rims. The ring has been cut. It is about " thick and 31' in diameter. The seal is circular; 2" in diameter. It has, in relief on the garface of the seal, a kneeling bull facing to the proper left, and some small emblems, which I do not quite understand, above it; and a line of writing, which I cannot read, all round it. The label on them says that they were received from Captain Campbell of Royakota." Royako ta is the former spelling of Râyako(properly Rayakôte in Kaparese), a bill fort, village and post office in the Krishnagiri tâlaka of the Salem district." 
The inscription consists of three Sanskrit verges, & passage in Tamil proge (11. 11 to 33), and a fourth Sanskrit verse at the end. The lour Sansksit verses must have been written or copied by a person who had only a very faint knowledge of that language. The Tamil portion is more correct, but shows many cases of doubling of initial and final consonants which are not sanctioned by the Tamil grammars.3 
The alphabet of the four Sanskrit verses is Grantha. The prose passage is written in Tamil characters, occasionally interspersed with Grantha words. The alpbabet of the inscription is docidedly more developed than that of the Kuram and Kašâkidi plates, but inore archaic than that of the Hastimalla plates. If it is admissible to compare the characters of stone inscriptions, which sometimes retain older forms, I would say that the alpliabet of 
* The tithi of the date therefore is one of the Kalpddis. ? Mr. Sewell's Lists of Antiquities, Vol. I. p. 196. 
Wherever the doubling is ivaduissible, I have enclosed oue (or two) of the consonanta in round brackets, + South-Ind. Insor. Vol. I. No. 161, aud Vol. II. No. 78. 5 Ibid. No. 76.

the Râyakota plates lies betteen the two Kil-Muttagûr inscriptions of Narasithavarman as the upper limit, and the two Âmbûr inscriptions of NȚipatunga-Vikramavarman as the lower one. 
After an invocation of Vishnu (vorge 1), the inscription furnishes the same genealogy as three inscriptions of the Pallava dynasty (viz, the Kailasanatha inscription of Rajasimha, the Kasakuļi plates, and the Udayêndiran plates of Pallayamalla') as far as Aśvatthâman. But While the Pallava inscriptionsó continue the line from Asvatthåman to his son Pallava, the Råyakðta plates seem to state that Asvatthåman had, by a Nâga woman, a son named Skandasishya, a descendant of whom was another Skandasishya, or, as he is called in the subsequent Tamil passage (1. 11), kô vijaya-Skandaśishya-Vikramavarman. 
The Tamil portion states that, in his fourteenth year, the king issued & written order to the inhabitants of the district of Paduvûr-köttam and to the inhabitants of Mêl-Adaiyâru-nadu, & subdivision of this district, by which he granted to a Brâhmana the village of Sârugûr (1. 14) in the same subdivision. This village received the surname Skandasishyamangalam (1. 22 f.) in honour of the donor. Among its boandaries we find (the hill named) Tiruvélalamudi (1. 26). This is tho Tami) equivalent of Vēļalaśikhara, a hill which is mentioned in the Udayêndliram plates of Pallavamalla among the boundaries of Udayachandramangalan---the modern Udayêndiram in the Gudiyatan tálakı of the North Arcot district.7 Consequently Saragør must have been situated near Udayêndiram, which, like Sârngür and Ambûr, belonged to Mêl-Adaigasu-nádr." 
The etymological meaning of Skandasishya is the pupil of the war-god.' The dynasty to which he belonged is not named in the inscription. That he claimed connection with the Palavas is evident from the two facts that his seal bears a ball,10 and that he derived his descen from the same mythical ancestors as the Fallava kings of Kärchỉ. On the other hand, the two words ko vijaya which are prefixed to bis name, and the title Vikramavarman which follow it, in line ll, connect him with certain other princes who profess to have been descendant both of the Pallavas and of the Western Gangas.l. As I have stated before, the alphabet of th Rêyakõta plates would well suit this allocation. The legend according to which Skandasishy was a remote descendant of another Skandasishya, who was born to the sage Abvatthåman b a Någa woman, seems to be connected with a similar legend, the heroes of which are th Chbļa king Kôkkilli and the Topdaimån (i.e. the Pallava king) Llandiraiyan.'* An inscriptio at Tirukkalukkupran mentions a Skandasishya who was anterior to the Pellava king Narasio hufarman I.18 and who, accordingly, must have reigned long bafore the king who issued t: subjoined grant. 
Acoording to line 12, the grant was made at the request of Mahávali-Vånarå ja, w] must have been a feadatory of Skandasishya. The title Banadhiraja or Mayali-Vânarâya w bestowed on the Western Ganga king Prithivipati II. by the Chola king Parántaka 1.14 u appears to have been the hereditary designation of the Bâņa chiefs, who derived their desce from the demon Bali,16

No. 9.–KONKUDURU PLATES OF ALLAYA-DODDA; 
SAKA-SAMVAT 1352. 
By G. V. RAJAMUOTI, B.A.; PARLAKINI LDI. These plates were discovered in 1887, deposited in a small square receptaclc in a brick mound in the village of Konkuduru, 115 miles north of Ramachandrapuram in the Goddvari district. They were not claimed by any one as private property, and Mr. S. H. Wyune, the Collector of the Godivari district, sent them in September 1893 to Dr. Haltzsch, to be kept in the Madras Museum. The set consists of seven copper plates with raised ring and strang on a ring. The ends of the ring are secured in the crescuat-shaped base of an oblung pedestal, which bears a recumbent figure of the sacred bull Nandi, with the symbols of the sun anů the moon in front of it. One end of the ring is loose, and the plates may be detached from the ring by bending it. The size of each of the platas is about 10% by 59", and the ring-hulo is about f" in diameter. The ring measures about 41" in diumeter and is abont " thick:

on the left margin of the socond side of each. Each plate bear's writing on both sides. A few letters on the first side of the first plate and a few others of the other plates, which are indistinct, being excepted, the inscription is on the whole well engraved and in good preservation. The language is, from line 1 to 130 and again from line 179 to 190, Sanskrit verge of various metres, while the intervening description of the boundaries of the village granted (11. 130-179) is in Telugu prose. Some ungrammatical and archaic as well as obsolete words oecur in the Telaga portion. The anusvára in such words as dímka (1. 135) and vângu (1. 139) is now omitted or attenuated into half-amzsvára. The following are some of the peculiarities of the alphabet and orthography of this inscription :- (1) The alphabet closely resembles the modern Telugu character; d, 4, 8, i, û in td, and a few other letters, however, present older forms. (2) In such conjunct consonants as nga, the anusvára is used instead of the proper nasal. (3) The anusvåra is improperly used in several cases, as prasaina (1. 126) for prasanna ; in tuimma (1. 138) the it is saperfluous. (4) In onunddi (I. 158) and aitta (1. 174), 4 and t are incorrectly doubled ; the doubling of y in palaniyyah (I. 182) appears to compensate for the shortening of the preceding long vowel, though it is incorrect. (5) Except in the word svargga (1. 184), consonants are not doubled after r. (6) The vertical bottom-stroke which the modern alphabet employs to mark the aspirates is here generally dispensed with, except in the case of th. Where the top-stroke is not used, a small vortical stroke or a mark like a circumflex is placed beneath or by the side of the letter (11. 35, 37). The blå of vibhüti (1.33) is distinguished from the ba of bála (1. 31) by the angle under which the d is affixed to the consonant. () The secondary form of l has two different shapes; compare (in 1.99) Mallayarya with Jallipalli. (8) Conjunct consonants 'as rya, ryo, rva are expressed, as in modern Telugu, by the full form of r, to which the secondary form of y or v is attached (11. 44, 47, 54); but ruộ and rvé are also expressed by the rêpha mark on the top of vô and ve. (9) No distinction is made between the short and long sounds of e and o even in Telugu vords. (10) Two ways of marking & and ô are noticeable. (11) In conjunct consonants the secondary form of y is not distinct from that of » (11. 31, 32, 35). (12) The second k in diłkámta (l. 35) is a full k without the top-stroke. (13) The si of Riguéda (1.100) has a top-stroke 
As may be seen from the abstract of contents (p. 67 below), the inscription contains the following pedigree of the Redại chief Allaya-Dodda of Rajamahendra :

The date of the grant was the time of Ardhodaya in the month Pausha of Saka-Sarvat 1953 (expired), which corresponded to the cyclic year Sådhåraña (V, 23). Professor Kielhorn kindly contributes the following remarks on this date :-“The Ardhôlaya takes place on the Dew-moon tithi of the amanta Pausha, provided this tithi falls on & Sunday, when during day-time the nakshatra is Sravana and the yoga Vyatîpåta. This most auspicious conjunction for making donations did take place in the given year. For in that year the new-moon tithi of the amanta Paasha ended 2 h. 20 m. after mean sunrişe of Sunday, 14th January A.D. 1431, when the nakshatra was Sravaņa for 17 k. 4 m. and the yôga Vyatipâta for 18 h. 56 m. after mean sunrige." 
The object of the grant was the village of Gumpiņi (F. 23), which was sarnaned Allâda reddidoddavaram (v. 24) or Doddavaram (11. 146, 155, 159, 169, 173, and 7. 89). This village cannot be traced on the map. But its position is defined by several villages which are mentioned in the description of its boundaries, and which, as Dr. Hultzsch informs me, are found on the Madras Survey Map of the Amalậpuram tåluke. These are Dêvarapalli (No. 27 on the map), Palavels or Palevelanow Palivela (No. 42 on the map), Mummadivaram now Mummadivarapadu (No. 26 on the map), Înthakota- now Itakóta (No. 22 on the map) Kêtardjupalli (No. 19 on the map) and Vedureśvaram- now Vedirêśvaram (No. 20 on the map). The porthern boundary of Gumpiņi was the Kauntêya river. This must be another name of the Gantami, or of its southern brauch which passes to the north.east of Paliyela. 
I may here insert some facts mentioned in two Telugu poems composed by Srinatha, via, the Kasikhandam and the Bhimakhandan, as they conörn and even add to the information recorded in this inscription. The poet was contomporary with the last three Reddi princes of the dynasty and dedicated the former poem to Virabhadrarsadi, the brother of the Doddaya reddi who issued the present charter, and the latter poem to the minister of Virabhadra. The Käsikhandan contains the following account :- Among the divisions of the Sadra caste, one is famed by the name of Panta-kula, of which Perumâdireddi, of the village Dûyûru, became celebrated as a devotee of Siva. He belonged to the Désati-vamsa. His wife was Annamâmbâ, by whom he had five sons, Allaya, Pedakóta, Annapróla, Doddaya and Pinnakóţa. The fourth, Doddaya,is styled Paştakularâja. He married another Annamâmbâ and had three BOLS, Prôla, Köta and Alada. The last is described as a great conqueror, and from the description the poet gives of his achievements, he seems to have risen to some importance and perhaps established a petty principality. His wife was Vêmâmbå, the grand-daughter of king Anavêma, who bore four sons, Vême, Virabhadra, Doddaya, and Annay8,6 The eldest of them is said to have led an expedition as far as the Vindhyas and to have conquered Sapta madiya-raya, the king of Jhůde-jantaru-nadu, the chiefs of Bårabadonti, and the kings of Oddadi and Kataka. He is also said to have received tribate from Panduvâsuradhâni, the king of Odde-dêsa, the king of Karņâta, the king of the Yavanas (P), and the chiefs 
LLLLLL__ 
This famous Telugu poet lived about the year 1435 A.D. He was putronized by the Reddi chi Rajamahåndra. Of his many works, the Panditardyacharitam was dedicated to Mainiţi.Praggaruyra, compeoder. in-chief of Vômireddi's forces; the Naiskadkan to Mantri-Singana, Pruggedayya's brother; the Bliméérarz Khandam to Bendapůdi Annayya, minister to Virabhadrareddi; and the Kablchardam to Virabhadrareddi; sec RHO Bahadur K. Virosalingam's Telugu Poets, Part I. p. 66. 
9 The introductory verses in the first canto of this poem and generally the initial and the final verses of each canto contain numerous references to incidents in the lives of the Reddi chiefs. 
a Compare Verse 4 of this inscription. 4 The inscription traces the generlogy of the dynasty from this chief. 5 Venimbê was, according to the inscription, the daughter of Bhima of the Choda family,

of Bårahadonti-manne and Saptamadiya.? The titles by which he was well known are Räravéấyábhujamga, Samgrimapårtba, Karpûravasantarâya and Jaganobbaganda. The second chief, Virabbadra, is described as even more powerful than his brother. The chiefs of Kasimikota, Veikatâyi, Kappakonda, Killeda and others are said to have been subdued by bim. He was crowned during the life-time of Vêmáređời. Virabhadra married Anitalli, the daughter of Vême, the son of king Kâta. He was a votary of Siva and a great warrior. The third chief, Doddaya,is also reported to have made many conquests. He led an expedition to the north and reduced Oddådi, Sțingårarakota and Lôtugeđờa.* He was a very skilful horseman. On the race-courses be made his horse jump over a space of twenty-four cubits in one bound. After briefly describing the virtues of the youngest, Annaya, the poet expresses the wish that his patron might rule the whole country including Chikați, Kalinga, Chilkasamudra and Simhaśailag from his capital Rajamahendra.7 
As regards the connection between the Reddis of Kondavidu8 and those of Rajamahendra nothing definite is known. The Bhimakhandan states that the chief Anåda became the ruler of a kingdom extending as far as Simhâdri, with his capital at Rajamahendra, by the influence of his relationship with Prôlaya, Anavêma, Anapota, Alavêna, Kumâragiri and others, who were the rulers of Påkanadu. It is probable that the Anavêma whose grand-daughter, Vêmâmbå, according to the Kasikhandam, was married to Alladabbûpati, is the Anavêma of Kondavida.10 But the present inscription says that Vêmâmbika was the daughter of Bhima of the Chôda family. To reconcile these two statements, it may be conjectured that Vêmâmbikî was the daughter of Anavêma's daughter and that Bhima was his son-in-law. We learn from the Tottaranûdi plates that Kataya-Vêma's wife and mother were, respectively, the daughter and sister of Anavóta, the elder brother of Anatôma;11 and the Kašikhandan tells us that this Kataya-Téma's daughter was married to Virabhadra, the second son of Têmâmbili. Thoagh the relationship between these two Reddi dynasties is thus established, it is not easy to explain how the kingdon of Rajamahendra came into the hands of Vêma and Vir bhadra. Kataya-Véma is said to have received it as a gift from Kumâragiri of Kondavidu ;12 and he must have possessed it until at least A.D. 1416, the date of the latest inscription 
1 Sapta-11ddiya probubly means seren hills' and Bårahadonti-manner twelve hill states * (?). Oddatli is in the Vizagapatan district and Kataka iu Orissa. There is a villnge called Påņduva in the Godavari district. The 
Yavanas are the Muhampadars. 
* This is the Reddi chief Kaţaya-Tema of Rajamahendra, on whom see above, Vol. IV. Nos. 46 and 47. 3 This is the Reddi chief who issued the present grant. “These places are in the Vizagapataw district. 
Compare verse 19 of the inscription. 
Chikati is at presenta Zamiodari in the Gañjam district. The extent of Kalinga was perhaps at this time much reduced. Chilkaganudre is the lake Chilka to the north of Gažjám, Simbaśaila is a bill with a temple in Vizsgøpitan. 
7 The position of Rajamahendra is described in the Kabllhandam as follows: The river (Gödávari) alors the l'estern city wall, the temple of Sri-Mullagúri-Sakti in the N.E. corner, sud the temple of Madania-Gonala in the fort. 
& Regarding the Reddis of Rondaviqa Mr. Sewell says in his Lists of Antiquities, Vol. II, p. 187 : After the subversion of the Gajapati Rájas of Orangal by the Muhammadans in A.D. 1323, the Reddi chiefs in different parts of the castern coast rose to power. Amongst these the Kondavidu chiefs were for & century so impor that their government rises to the dignity of a kingdom, and tbeir family to that of dynasty » mühap gives a list of six chiefs with dates wbich do not tally with those given at p. 53 ff. Kumâragiri-Reddi is suit tu bave ruled from A.D. 1381 to 1895 (p. 187), but on p. 58 two inscriptious referring to him are recorlari which are dated in A.D. 1405 and 1407.

referring to him. He had a son, but it is not known whether the latter inherited the principality.s 
From the foregoing facts and from the inscriptions noted by Mr, Sewell, it is evident that this dynasty exercised but an ephemeral sovereignty. Doddaya, the fourth son of Perumadi, first rose to some importance, probably as an officer of the Kondavidu Reddis. Then his third 900, Allåda, improved that position and transmitted it to his adventurous sons, who established a principality with Rajamahendra as their capital. But neither Vema's sons, if any, nor those of any of his brothers seem to have inherited their throne. The Gajapatis of Orissa or the kings of Vijayanagara must have driven the Reddis from Rajamahindra. The encouragement which these Reddis gave to Telugu poets is one noteworthy fact of their short-lived government, which entitles them to the gratitude of posterity.

Two further shares in the agrahára were given to the Vishnu temple called Prasanna illabha and to the Siva temple of Brahmanageśvara (v.85). Finally Dodda (II.) gave to the nchúra tho village of Annavaram for subsistence (grimagrásárthamx), with the exception (?) 
4 shiris belonging to Naranamantrin, the son of Aubhaļâmâtya (v. 86 f.). The iundaries of the granted village are written in the language of the country (ie. Telugu) 1.88). 
In the detailed description of the boundary-line of Allådareddidoddavaram (11. 130-179), e following villages are mentioned : Devarapalli, Palavela or Palevola, Mummadivaram, athakôța, Annavarapupadu, Ketarâjupalli and Vedurêśvaram. The northern boundary as the Kauntéya river.' 
Verge 89 praises the village of Doddavaram on the bank of the Âdikunta. In verse 90, ing Dodda (II.), (the son) of king Allâda, requests future kings to protect the grant. Verses 1-96 are six of the usual imprecatory verses.

[Vol. V 
N.). 10,- PITHAPURAMI PLATES OF VIRA-CHODA, 
DATED IN HIS TWENTY-THIRD YEAR. 
BY H. KRISHNA Saster, B.A. The copper plates which bear this inscription were forwarded to Dr. Hultzsch by the Government of Madras. They were sent by the Raja of Pithapuram to Mr. D. F. Carmichael when he was Chief Secretary, 2.e. between the years 1875 and 1878. Mr. Carmichael had lent the plates for examination to Dr. Burnell, who figured the second side of the third plate in his Sout?- Indian Palæography, second edition, Plate xxix.? 
The plates are nine in number. Each of them bears writing on both sides, except the first and last which are engraved only on their inner sides. They are not of uniform size; but each measures, on the average, 10" by 53" To the proper right of each plate is a hole, i" in diameter. Through these holes is passed a massive ring which is now cut. It is " thick and 74" in diameter. Its ends are secured in a circular seal which measures 34" in diameter. As may be seen in the collotype No. 2 on the Plate facing p. 104 of Vol. III. above, the seal rests on an expanded lotus flower and bears, in relief on a counter-sank surface, the legend frê. Tribhuvan[um]kuša in Telugu letters. Above the legend it bears a boar which faces the proper left and has an elephant-gond operhead. In front of the boar are a chauri, a conch, and the moon; and behind it, anuther chauri, a svastika, and the sun. Below the legend there is a drum (?), an expanded lotus flower, and apparently a wooden stand for supporting the abhishéka dish. 
As observed by Dr. Burnell, the inscription is written in the transitional Telugu alphabet. This is shown e.g. by the two forms, one the earlier and the other later, in which the mi of Dakshinamurti in ll. 162 and 163 appears. The final 3 is used in two cases, víz. in 11. 45 and 63; but in all other cases the anustūra takes the place of final m. The only groups in which the nasal is not represented by anusuára are nta, nda, nta and nda- The difference in the secondary forms of a and á, i and %, u and 4, 0, ô and au is not kept up throughout. In three cases the long ù is marked by & and 2, viz. in the û of mündunu in l. 215 and the û of dürppuna in II. 262 and 263. The é of pyê of bhümér=apy=ékao in l. 278 is added to the secondary y. The writing is protected by raised rims and is consequently in a state of perfect preservation, oxcept certain letters written over erasures. The language of the inscription is Saziskřit poetry (verses 1-35) and Sanskrit prose (11. 2-17; 18-31 ; 68-71; 80-186; 271-277; and 279 to 280). The description of the boundaries (11. 187-271) is in a mixture of Telugu and Sanskrit prose. As regards orthographical peculiarities, it may be noted that a consonant, besides being, as usual, doubled after the secondary form of r, is frequently doubled after an anusvára, as in II. 2, 21, 23, 28 etc.; that ri is used for ri in krita for krita (1l. 2 and 20) and Hrishikésc for Hrishikeśa (1. 115); and that in conjunct consonants the secondary r is not only omitted in several cases, but is mistakenly represented by e in såddhê for sdrdha (1. 12). by i in niggitya for virgatya (1.15), and by & in Vishnuvaddhúnô for Vishnuvardhan ô (1. 22). Stnina for snana (1. 20) and scârtvan for sárthair (1. 61) are due to the vernacular pronunciation of Sanskrit words. The symbol for r is used in the following cases :---- (l) in proper names --Chiriyânedir, Erasevaka, Eriyapota, Kadalusisuküla, Perumbugakkadal and

The only copper-plate inscription of Vira-Chola, which has been published before, are the Chellûr plates of his 21st year. Like these plates and other inscriptions of the lator Easteru Châlakyas, the subjoined inscription opens with a mythical genealogy of the Chalukya family (11. 1-18) and a bistorical account of the Eastern Châlukya kings (1. 19 f.). This part of the inscription contains nothing new to us, but agraes in every detail with the account given in the Chellûr plates. The reign of Vira-Choda is described in perses 18-26. Of these verses, 18-21 correspond to verses 18-21 of the Chellûr plates. Verse 20 gives the correct reading of the town where Vîra-Chôda was crowned, vis. Jananáthanagari, which is perhaps a poetical form of Rajamalêndrapura, the modern Rajamahêndri. In perse 21 the Saka date of Vira Chôda's accession is expressed by the numerical words sasi-kh-umbar-éndu. This parious reading shows that Dr. Hultzsch was right iu understanding the word khadvaya in sasi khaduny-éndui, as the corresponding verse of the Chellúr plates reads, to represent 'two cyphers,' and not a 'cypher' and a 'two,' which would be another possible.explanation.* Verse 22 states that Vira-Chôda bore the tiile Samastabhuvandíraya.6 Verses 25 and 26 state that his father, the emperor, viz. Kulôttunga-Chôļa I., recalled him, but sent him back" for the conquest of the north ” in the fifth year, apparently of Vira-Chôda's reign. The recall of Vira-Choda and his temporary stay with his father may be considered either as a punishment for misbehaviour and rebellion, or he may have been recalled to help his father against a foreign enemy, perhaps against the Pândya king who, according to the Pithapuram pilar inscription of Prithvisvara, was defeater by Vedura II., a vassal of Vira-Choda. On the same occasion the Pandyas may have adopted the title Räjiga-Cháļa-manõbhanga, 'one who frustrated the wishes of Rajiga-Chola, .e. of KalóttungI.? Vira-Chôda's subsequent return to Vôngi may have been due to political troubles in his province, his absence from which may have contributed to the rise of feudatory families like the Velanându and Kôna chiefs, who, later on, obtained possession of the Vêngi country. 
The object of the inscription is to record that Virg-Chôda granted, at a summer-solstice, the village of Virachôdachaturvedimangala, which was formed by uniting three different villages, viz. Málavelli with its twelve hamlets (pândi) and Ponnatorra, both in the district of Prôlunându, and Âlami in the district of Uttaravarusa (ll. 68-71 and 182-186). Lines 80-180 contain a list of the donees. The description of the boundaries of the granted village is given in 11. 186-271. Lines 271-274 assign twelve shares in Virachodachaturvêdimangala for the maintenance of certain village officers. Seven further shares were assigned to the presiding deities in the centre, in the west, and in the other quarters of Virachôdachaturvédimangala (11. 274-276). The date of the grant was the twenty-third year of the king's reign (1. 279 f.), i.e. two years after the Chellûr plater. The inscription ends with the statement that the executors (ajñapti) of this edict were the five ministers (pañoha pradhanah), and that the composer vas

2 The only difference, probably due to a mistake of the writer, to be noted in this portion, is the length of the reign assigned to Guņaga-Vijayaditya. He is suid to have ruled forty (chatvarim&at) yours (1. 26), iustead of forty-four (chatuáchatudrimsat) as in all the other Eastern Chalukya inscriptions.

The donees of the grant were no less than five hundred and thirty-six Bråhmaņas, who are grouped according to their gotras. Appendices A. and B. contain the names of these Brähmaņas, and the naives of the various gôtras to which they belonged, in alphabetical order, The titles which are added to their names are:-- sahasra, shadangavid, bhatta, Dasapuribhatta of Dasapuriyabhatta, trivédir or trivedibhatta, and hômaydjin or bhattasómaydjin.. Alasabrahma and Parthasdrathi are the only two names that occur without any titles. The majority of the names are of Tamil origin. For most of the following explanations of these names I am indebted to Mr. V. Venkayya, M.A. Tillanayaka and Ambalattådi are names of the god Nataraja at Chidambaram. The former means the lord of Tillai' (Chidambaram), and the latter the dancer in the (Golden) Hall' Kimakotisahasra is called after the goddess Kamakoti at Kanchi. Taniyaperumân stands for Tanigaiperuman, s.e. the god of Tanigai, which is another name of Tiruttaņi near Arkonam. The temple at Tiruttani is dedicated to the god Subrahmanya. Kanda is a Tamil (or Prakrit) form of the Sanskrit Skanda. Verņakata is a modified form of Venneykküttan, i.e. Krishna, who was very fond of butter (venney). Ulala mañđàn means 'one who swallowed the universe. This may perhaps refer to Krisliņa, who, while yet a child, was one day suspected by Yasôdå of having swallowed mud. On being asked by her to open his mouth, he did so, and to her astonishment Yasodâ found that the whole universe was within bim. Karimákya is probably a mistake for Karimâņikya, "the black gem, a Tamil sarname of Krishna. Kariyako, 'the black king,' also refers to Krishna. Ohendå marakan & has to be dissolved into sen-dámarai-kannan, i.e. he whose eyes resemble red lotuses. This is the Tamil equivalent of the Sanskțit Pundaríkáksha, an epithet of Viskņu. Palligondån, he who is sleeping,' refers to ślskaśáyin (Vishnu). Simhapirân is the lion-god Nrisimaha. Siralañgð stands for Sir-inn-983 which means the illustrious yuvardjų. This refers to Lakshmana, who is often called Iļaiya-Perumal in Vaishnava works. Kadalusiruküla refers to Hangmat, who jumped over the sea (kadal) as if it were & small canal (siru-kál). Malabiniya-nindranis properly Malai-kuniya-zigrán, meaning "one who stood so that the mountain bent. This refers to the sage Agastya, who commanded the Vindhya mountain to prostrate itself before him, Tiruvaraógamudayân and Tirumalayudayån are named, respectively, after the gods at Srirangan and Tirumalai (or Tirupati). Arulárs or Aralála is derived from the Aralala-Perumal temple at Little Kanchi. In Attiyârålibhatta, Attiyâr is perhaps a mistake for Attiyûr, the Tamil Dame of Little Kanchi. Chelya stands for Selva, i.e. Selvappilai, the god at Mélukôte in the Mysore State, Tirupoliyanindrån means one who stood resplendent' This is the pame of the god at Tirukkurngûr, as mentioned in the Guruparampardprabhava. Tiripâyikkulamadayan is perhaps derived from Tiruvâykkulam, one of the names of the Rajagôpåla-Perumal temple at Manimangalam in the Chingleput district, Vittirirdin, one who is pleased to sit,' is the name of the Vaishnava temple at Dûsi in the North Arcot district. Tirnkurangadibhatta is called after the village of Kurungađi in the Tinnevelly distriot. According to the Guruparampardprabhdich, Yajñamûrti was the name of a certain samazyasin of the Advaita school. It is said of him that be held a disputation with Ramanuja and, being defeated, became a convert to the Vaishņaya faith. Âlidêvayabhatta is named after Tirumangai-A!vår, who in Tamil works bears the

The first of these was the grandson of Nadamuni,l and the second name is a corruption of Alagiyamaņayâļa or, in Sanskrit, Ramyajâmåtri, i.e. the beautiful bridegroom." Ghritâsi is probably a Sanskrit rendering of Neyyunda, which forms part of the name of Neyyandâ får, one of the Vaishnavi Âcharyas mentioned in the Guruparamparaprabháva. The list of Acharyas given on pp. 82 and 83 of this work, includes, among many others, the names of Sundarattôļudaiyán, Periyandan and Chisiyåndån, while that of Periyanambi occurs on p. 153. Sundarattoludaiyan also occurs ip the Tirupparaökunram inscription of Sundara-Pandya and means the god who has beautiful arms.' Tirunândudayanbhatta is called after Tirunânda, which occurs in Vaishnava works as a synonym for Vaikantha, the abode of Vishnu. The title Nadavirukkum, which means 
one who is in the middle,' an arbitrator' (madhyastha), occurs in l. 177 of the subjoined inscription and is found also in the large Leyden grant, 1. 138. Chida in Chiềabhatta is the same as Sidan, a Tamil form of fishya, 'a pupil' Tévadi means the feet (f.e. the servant) of god. Årâmudu means 'fresh nectar;' Mapattukkiniyån means 'one who is ploasing to the mind ;' and Ayirarajôti is the thousand-rayed,' i.e. 'the sad.' Two of the Manimangalam inscrip tions mention the names Dôņaya and Dôņaiya; the similar name Dönaya occurs repeatedly among the donees. Such an abundance of Tamil names in the list of donees of Virachôdachatur vodimangala leads one to infer that a large immigration or importation of Tamil Brahmanag to the north ' must have taken place during the reign of Kulottunga-Chôla I. The large proportion of Vaishnava names among the dopees further suggests that about this time the Råmânuja faith counted many devotees, who adopted as their names the Tami) equivalents of Sanskrit names, which occur in the sacred works of Vaisbņayas. Three of the donees bear the title Brahmamahardja, which must have been an invention of the Chola king Râjarê ja I. in whose inscriptions it is first found. Of these three dopees one was called Kulottungachoda brahmanahårája after the reigning sovereign. The second was a military officer ( sênápati) and had the title Rajarajabrahmamaharaja, which, as we know from the Chellûr plates, had been conferred on a certain Pòtana. The third had the name Kumaranarayanabrahmamahárâja, which was perhaps derived from a surname of Vira-Chôda himself. 
The boundaries of Virachôdachaturvedimangala were : in the south, Ponnavada and Mallavrolu; in the west, Kolliprôlu and Chembrölu; in the north, Polakumbarra, Dankalapûņļi and Benqapůņại; and in the east, the sea (1). 186-188). With line 188 begins a second, much more detailed description of the boundary-line of the granted village. This passage enumerates various canals, tanks, ponds, hamlets, hills, boulders, pieces of waste-land and high ground, foot-paths, ant-hills, valleys etc. It also includes the names of a number of trees, an alphabelical list of which is given in Appendix C. Of the villages that are mentioned 
[An aböreviated form of this name is Natha in Sanskrit, 48 will be seen from the expression sadhyabhaktinishtha Mathidayah, which cours on p. 36 of the Fattudramatadipiki of Srinivåsad åsa, Telugu edition, Madras, 1868. In his remarks on this work (Report on the Searoh for Sanskrit Monuscripts for the year 1883-84, p. 70, No. 164), Dr. Bhandarkar gives a list of the Vaishnava Acharyas mentioned at the beginning of the Yatindrematadtnika. In this list occurs Sriparkökusındtha ag the nome of one of the Acharyad. But tbp tern Sriparkökušanátha evidently devoter two individuals, Sriparåók usa and Natha, the foriner being the name of Naumálvår, alias Sathari or, in Tamil, Sadagópa. The latter, Natha, refers to NAdamani...V.] 
* This is the name given to Rámia in Vaishyava works. : Madras edition, Kaliyugadi 4990, Virodlin. A Archeological Survey of Southern India, Vol. IV. p. 52. s South-Ind. Insor, Vol. III. Nos, 31 and 36. 
6 The Nalayiraprabandham, which is called the “ Dravida. Tada," is a collection of Tamil poems written by the Alvârs. The Råmânuja Vaishňavas, especially those of the Tengulai sect, have a greater regard for Tami] which is the lauguage of their supred texts, than for Sanskrit, jast as the Madhye Vaisbynvas prefer the Kannada lauguuge.

in the grant, the following admit of identification. One of the two villages? which formed the southern boundary of Virachôdachaturvêdimangala, Ponnapäda, may be identified with Ponnada which is found to the east of Pithapuram on the ladras Survey Map of the Pithapuram division. The Western boundaries, Kolliprólu and Chembrôlt, are found on the same map as Gollaprol and Chebrolu, on the bigh-road from Pithapuram to Kattipudi. Bendapundi, one of the northern boundaries, is Bendapudi, on the road to Vizagapatem. Two other villages between which the northern boundary passed, Singavikrama and Dontengi (1. 25), are found on the map as Srungarrukham and Tondangi between Bendapudi and the 8a. Among the boundaries of Navavada, & hamlet of Virachôdachaturvedimangala (1. 266 ), we find Beņqapandi ( the modern Bendapadi ) and Duggavada. This village is identical with the modern Durgada, which is found on the map between Bendapudi and Chabrolu. Chembrola, the modern, Chebrolu, belonged to the district of Bottepinându (1. 209). The district of Prölunându, in which Malavelli and Ponnatorta were situated (1. 69 and 182), is already known from two inscriptions in the Kuntimadhava temple at Pithapuram, and incloded also Nayakhandavâda (near Pithảpuram) and Sarpayaram.'

ABRIDGED TRANSLATION. 
! 
(Verse 1.) The glorions Hari (Vishņu), the first of the gods, produced from the lotus of his navel Viriñchi (Brahma), in order to create these three worlds. From him was born, it is said, the great sage Atri; (and) from Atri the Moon, who has taken up his abode on the crest of Mahesvara (Śiva). 
[Lines 2-60, except verse 15 which is translated below, agree with the Chelldr plates of Vire-Chôda.] 
(V. 15.) “O brave (son)! Take up the burden of the Vêngi country which is bereditary in (our) family. Powerful men, though young, are verily fit for their duties." 
(V. 22) Protecting & crore of the poor by granting (them) the objects of (their) desires ; those in fear by (his) arm which dispelled the fears of refugees; and the subjects by adhering to his duty, he bears the name Samastabhuvandsraya (5.6. the refnge of the whole world), which is full of significance. 
(V. 23.) Rising from the earth, attaining to great heights, spreading over all quarters, transcending all heavens and reaching still highor worlds, his fame, which destroys (all) evils, far excels the Gangå, which drops from heaven, falls upon this earth (and) takes & still more downward conrse, 
(V. 24.) The king of serpents (Śêsha), having abandoned the toils of the burden of the earth, protects the lower world undisturbed; the whole earth, too, avoiding other, bad rulers, is freed from agitation; and the hosts of gods enjoy the numerous sacrifices of the prosperous twice-born. Thus these three worlds are verily in great glee while this (king) is bearing the burden of the earth. 
(V. 25.) While ruling the earth anopposed, he was called (back) by (his) father, the emperor, (who was) desirous of gazing on the beauty of (his) body which was blooming with youth. 
(V. 26.) Looking at him, the youth, who, like the (waxing) moon, was day by day acquiring new splendour which gave delight to the eyes, the lord of kings could never satisfy his eyes, bat sent (his) son back in the fifth year, in order to conquer the north. 
(L. 68.) This asylum of the whole world, the glorious Vishņuvardhana mahardjadhiraja, rajaparamésvara, paramabhattáraka, the most pious one, the glorious Vira Chôdadêva, having called together all householders, (viz.) the Rashtrakúțas etc. inhabiting the district of Prôlunându, thus issues his commands in the presence of the ministers, the family priest, the commander of the army, the heir-apparent and the door-keepers : 
[Vv. 27-32 are in praise of the Bråhmaņa caste.] (L. 80.) These (Brihmapas) are enumerated with their names and gôtras. [LI. 80-180 contain a list of the donees.t]

* This verae follows verse 15 of the Chelldr plates. In these plates it is omitted by the engraver, though required by the context.

: The attributes given to the fame and to the Gang. Admit of & second explanation, suggesting that the former went to beaven and the latter to hell. 
- The names of 8 donees have been erased, vis, of [Maltimånbhatta and Mediyabhatta in l. 99; of AdabiyAnbhatta in 1, 111; of Sri-Vasudevabhatta and Sri Rama ada ya*]bhatta in l. 123; of Alavanda bhatta in 1. 164: of Śrl-Raticaláthabhatta in 1. 166; and of Prabodha iyapandita in 1. 1977. On the other band the following 8 donees received & extra shares :- Abhirimemurti who was the officiating priest (purohita) of the king (1.80), 1 extra share ; Niravadyabhatta who performed the Pajapêya sacrifice (11. 148-149),- 1 extra share; Dámódarabhatta (1. 172), - 1 extra shure; Rajarajabrahmamaharaja who was the commander of the forces (adwipati) (11. 175-176), 8 extra shares; Kumaranáriyanabrahmamaharaja (1 176),-- 1 extra sharo; and Prabodhasirapandita (1. 177), 1 extra gbare. The totale of the donees and of the shares, as stated in 11. 181-182 of the text (536 and 544), may be arrived at by adding the 8 erased names to 528 which is the number of donees actually named in the plates, and by adding 8 extru shares to the single shares of the 586 donees.

MAUNGGUN GOLD PLATES. 
101 
No. 11.- MAUNGGUN GOLD PLATES. By Maung TUN NYEIN, HONORARY ARCHÆOLOGICAL OFFICER, BURHA. These two gold plates were found in a brick last year by some people who were digging foundations for a new pagoda at Maunggun village near Hmawza in the Prome district. They were sent by Sir Frederic Fryer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Burma, to Dr. Hultzsch for transmission to the British Museum, London. 
Each of the two plates bears three lines of writing and is inscribed on one side only. The letters show through on the reverse. The weight of the first plate is 110 grains, and that of the second 148 grains. The inscriptions consist of quotations from the Buddhist scriptures. They are in the Pâli language and are written in characters which, it is believed, were in vogue in the first century A.D. when the kingdom of Prome (Sirikhettara) was in the zenith of its power. The alphabet corresponds to a large extent with that used in the ioscriptions at Pagan of the fourth and fifth centuries, and several of the letters also resemblo those of the South Indiau class of alphabets. It is probable that the Burmese written language was mainly derived from India, whence colonists settled in Prome which was once a sea-port town.

(He has also explained) the four means of obtaining supernatural power (iddhipada); the four kinds of right exertion (sammappadhana); the four kinds of earnest meditation (suti patthana) ; the four sublime truths (ariyasachcha); the four subjects of fearlessness (vesârajju);

the five moral qualities (indriya); the five kinds of vision (chakkhu); the six kinds of uncommon wisdom (asádhäranu (nâna]); the seven requisites for attaining snpreme knowledge (bojjhanga); the sublime eightfold path; the nine transcendent conditions (lokuttarâ dhanma); the ten forces (hala); the fourteen requisites for the attainment of Buddhanood; the eighteen attributes of a Buddha. 
Second Plate. Whatever }aws are produced from cause, the cause of these the Tathågata has expounded, as well as the cessation of both the cause and the effect. This is the teaching of the great ascetic. 
For these reasons (viz. previously acquired virtues) the Blessed one (Buddha) is called the Venerable cne, the truly and perfectly enlightened Being, one endowed with knowledge and conduct, the Happy one, one knowing the universe, the Preeminent one, the Bridler of men's wayward passions, the Master of gods and men, and the blessed Buddha. 
The Blessed one hus well expounded his law, whose benefits are evident to the eye, which is advantageous at all times and seasong, which can boldly invite criticism, which can, if closely observed, lead up to Nirvara, and with whose details, severally, the wise should be acquainted. 
No. 12. AEMADABAD INSCRIPTION OF VISALADEVA ; 
(VIKRAMA-]SAMVAT 1308. 
By Rev. J. E. ABBOTT, B.A. This inscription is on a pillar in the mosque of Ahmad Shah I. (A.D. 1411-1443), in the Bhadr at Ahmadâbâd. I edit it for the first time. The inscribed pillar is to the right of the palpit and faces the latticed gallery. The letters are on the whole well preserved, though & few are damaged. The inscription is complete, with the exception of the beginning and end of the first line, which contain a part of the date. The name of the month is therefore lost. The language is Sanskrit, but influenced by Gajaráti, forming & mixed language common at that period. The form of the letters is such as is found in the inscriptions of Visaladeva and other Chaulukya kings of that period. 
The inscription belongs to the reign of Visaladers and is dated in [Vikrama-Sauvat 1808 about A.D. 1251), on the 11th day of & month the name of which is broken away, on a Sunday. It records the gift of a trellis window or screen (jázt) in the temple of Uttarêsvara at Mâhimsaka, by one Pathada, a servant of Sodhaladêyi. 
The question of special interest is the identification of Mahimsaka, the place in which the Hindû temple stood, which Ahmad Shah used as material for his mosque. If it is to be identified with some place distant from Aḥmadábåd, there are three places of similar name. which might be derived from Mahimsaka, vis, Månså and Mésånå to the north of Ahmedabad. and Mahiså in the Thagra tålaka of the Kaire collectorate ; bat none of these places contains ruins that suggest of their having been used by Ahmad Shah as the quarry for his mosona The usual custom of the Muhammadan conquerors was that of desecrating Hindu temples and modifying them on their own site to suit their purposes as mosques. If such were the case

FOUR INSCRIPTIONS OF KULOTTUNGA-OHOLA.

Tees 
C.-Inscription of the 44th year at Chidambaram.? This inscription is engraped on the outside of the north wall of the innermost práktra of he Natardja temple at Chidambaram. That portion of it which contains the date has been sublished before in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XXIII. p. 297 f. and above, Vol. IV. p. 70. he alphabet and language are Tami), Lines 1-5 and 9-14 are in prose, and lines 5-9 contain ne verse. 
The inscription is dated in the 44th year of Jayadhara (1.5 f.), From the Kalingattu Parani we know that this was a surname of Kulôttunga-Chola I., to whose reign the present ecord must be assigned accordingly. Professor Kielhorn has calculated the details of the ate (1.6 f.) and has found that it corresponds to Friday, the 13th March A.D. 1114,3 
The first portion of the inscription records donations made to the temple at Chidambaram Tillai, 11. 7 and 9, or Tiruchchirsambalam, 1. 12) by Kundavai Âlvår, (the daughter of) lajaraja and younger sister of Kulôttunga-Chôļa. She presented the god with a golden essel (1.3) and a mirror (l. 10) and covered (the roof of) the shrine with gold (1. 8). The second portion (11. 10-14) states that a stone which the king of Kamboja had given to lajendra-Chôļa was, by order of the latter, inserted into the wall of a hall in front of the shrine. 
Of the names mentioned in the preceding paragraph, Kulottunga-Chola (1. 1 f.) and kájøndra-Chôļa (11. 10 and 11) refer to the reigning king Kulôttunga-Chôļa I., Tho is known o bave originally borne the name Rajendra-Chôļa (II.) and to have subsoquently assumed the lame Kulottunga.“ Rajaraja, the father of Kulottunga's younger sister Kandavai (11. 2 and ), is identical with the Eastern Chalukya king Râjarâja I. (A.D. 1022-1063).

village of Dibbida Agraharam, in the Viravilli tâluka of the Vizagapatam district. I edit the inscription which they contain from an excellent impression, supplied to me by Dr. Hultzsch. 
These are five copper-plates, the first of which is inscribed on one side only, and each of which measures about 9?" broad by 35" high. They are numbered in Telugu figures, which are engraved near the proper right margin of the second sido of each plate. The plates have slightly raised rims, and, with the exception of the fifth plate which is broken in three pieces and of which a small marginal piece is missing, they are well preserved, so that the writing on them nearly throughout may be read with absolute certainty. The plates are strong on a ring which had not been cut whon they were received by Dr. Hultzsch. This ring is about 3." in diameter and t" thick, and has its ends secured in a seal which bears two fishes, in relief, on an elliptical surface of about 1" by 3".- Though not very uniform, the writing, on the whole, is well engraved. The characters are intermediate between those of the latest Eastern Chalakya inscriptions: and the Telugu characters, properly so called. On the forms of individual letters only few remarks are necessary. The signs for th and dh throughout are open at the top (e.g. in Svasatla, 1. 36, and randhra, 1. 31), and the sign for bh is generally open at the bottom (e.g. in gallabha. I. 1). The sign for d (e.g. in Pandava, 1. 30, and Paragandda, 1. 25) bas no top stroke (talakattu) and therefore closely resembles the l of the Eastern Chålukya inscriptions ; on the other hand, a top-stroke is employed in the sign for ! (in ajigaļana, l. 12, bhilla-taruh, 1. 59, and -talah, 1. 61), the right top of which, besides, is formed into a loop. For the initial ri we have an unusual (perhaps incorrect) form in Rigvedadhya- at the end of line 39; and the signs for the medial i and I are hardly ever, if at all, properly distinguished. The size of the letters varies between about 1 and ".-The language is Sanskrit, but the description of the boundaries in lines 52-64 contains some Telaga words. Up to line 36 the inscription ig in verse, and five more verses occur in lines 65-73. In respect of orthography, the chief points to be noted are that consonants (especially g, d, t, 6 and bh, but also ch, j, t, d, dh, p and v). which follow upon an anusvára, are frequently doubled ; and that, when such is the case, oh and dh are doubled by prefixing to them the same aspirated letters, except in the word vasuiddharian in line 68. Before r, t is doubled in muni-ttridasa-, 1.5; and y is doubled after i in tritiuuá, 1, 32, and palaniyyah, 1. 71. Besides, instead of rạ we have rem in qvatírnyas, 1. 6, and an in Játékarnna-, 1. 41. 
The insoription records (in vr. 20,21 and 26) that on Saturday, the Akshaya-tritiya of the month Vaisakha of the Saka year counted by the moon (1), the apertures of the body (9) the earth (1) and the moon (1), i.e. of Saka-Sarrivat 1191, the chief Arjuna of the Matsya family, for the spiritual welfare of his father Jayanta, granted to certain Brihmanas, as an garanára, tihe village of Drubbidi, which he called Jayanta-Narayana after his father. The full genealogy of the donor (in vv. 1-19) is as follows: 
From the lotus on Vishnu's navel sprang Brahman, from him Atri, and from him Roivapa. In his lineage was the sage Náranga, who one day, while wandering in the sky, saw the river Matsya which rises on the Mukunda mountain, descended to its banks, and engaged there in austere penance. To disturb the sage, the frightened Indra sent the Apsaias Mañughôshå. By the sage's curge she was changed into a fish (mateyd), swallowed the semen which the ascetio had thrown into the water, and in due course gave birth to a son who was

Of the villago granted, two shares wero set aside for the gods Hari and Hara! (1. 51) while one sbare was assigned to each of the following twenty Brâhmaņas (11. 37-51): The Furóhita (or family priest of the chief) Vâmadêva, a Sôma-yâga sacrificer, of the Bhâradyâja gôtra ; the teachers of the Rigveda Mêrubrahman and Viddana of the Harita gôtra, Namana of the Kaundinya gótra, Vennakůta of the salâyata gôtra, Pôtašarman of the Vâdhủla gâtra, Remana of the Mudgala gôtra, and Dommana of the Bharad våja gótra ; the students of the Rigveda Vennskůta of the Harita gótra, Mânaśarmaa of the Salâvata (?) gotra, and Yajñamûrtyårya of the Kusdina (Kauņdiaya) gôtra; the teachers of the Yajurvéda Akoņdi of the Vatsa gôtra, Bhímés rarârya of the Bharadvaja gôtra, Srirangårya of the Kauņdinya gôtra ; Vîrabhadrâsvararya of the Gaatama gôtra, and Lôkanátha of the Kâsyapa gôtra ; the students of the Yajurvéda Raghava of the Mudgala gôtra and Purushottamašarman of the Gautama gôtra; the student of the Karva súkha (of the Yajurveda) Madhapärya of the Jâtû karna gôtra; and the student of the Sri-bhagavata (Purâņa) Maúkanår ya of the Harita gôtra. The grant made in favour of these donees included the services or taxes, due from the village artisans, viz. the carpenter, goldsmith, barber (?), blacksmith, potter and sesamum-grinder (v. 22); but apparently: was exclusive of eight drônas* of land which had been previously given by the chief to the minister Peddana (11. 66 and 67). 
The boundaries of the village were (11. 52-64): 'On the east, & babúl tree on the northern side of the embankment of the tank of Manki-Nayaka ;6 to the south-east of this, a house ;6 thence (the village of) Käkatikhandi; thence the embankment east of a rimba tree; thence the embankment of (the) Ddrabanda (tank); thence an ant-hill; (and) thence the northern corner of the embankment of the tank of the low-caste people. On the south-east of the village, a fixed? stone; to the west of this, the tamarind trees of Tur[ûru]; (and) thence the bricks of a temple. On the south-west of the village, a garlic field on the west of a poison-tree; thence & house of bricks; thence the space between a wood-apple tree and a poison-tree; thence & bhilla tree; thence the tamarind trees of Anupumali; thence a green piece of land to the south of Boddapådu; thence an ant-hill; thence three tamarind trees; thence a young palmyra tree (and) thence & stone on an ant-liill. On the north-west of the village, a . . . . . stone on the top of a hill; on the east of this, a grinding-stone; thence a shed and a rock; thence & svarnapushpi tree; thence a kshira-tree; thence e, ..., ant-hill; thence an old fixed stone ; (and) thence an ant-hill. On the north-east of the village, a fixed large stone.' 
Lines 67-72 of the inscription contain three of the ordinary imprecatory verses. 
Regarding the chiefs mentioned in this inscription I have not obtained any information from other sources. Nor am I able to identify any of the localities, except the village of Drubbidi itself, which must be the Dibbida Agrahiram where the plates were found. 
The date of the grant regularly corresponds, for Saka-Samvat 1191 expircd, to Saturday, the 8th April A.D. 1289. On this day the third tithi of the bright half of Vaisakha ended 6 h. 6 m. after mean sunrise, and the day therefore was the proper day for the Akshaya-tšitiya festival.

• Originally Ppo. was engraved. 
* This word is almost entirely effaced, and the reading is very doubtful. The writing in line 50, and in lipa 51 before the word d&06(vau), is rather carelesely engraved. 
& Bead Fajñamiirtydryyahı * Here, and in other places below, the rules of sandhi have not been observed. 29 This is clearly the actual reading. The intended reading probably is dhithrih, as in 158

No. 15.- THREE COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTIONS OF 
GOVINDACHANDRA OF KANAUF. 
Br F. KIDLHOEN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E.; GÖTTINGEN. The originals of these inscriptions are now in the Lucknow Museum. My account then is based on impressions, kindly furnished to me by Dr. Führer 11 who also has inform me where and when the original plates were found.18 I have treated of them in the sa manner as of the Kamauli plates of Govindachandra, above, Vol. IV. p. 101 f. 
1 Read -nairfitydm. 
The reading may possibly be dhála-. * The ordinary Sanskrit spelling would be mandapa. * Metro: Slaka (Aurshtubh).- Compare Ind. Ant. Vol. XIV. p. 58, 11. 51-54. 
With the exception of part of the sign for atı, the lettere in these brackets are broken away. 6 The aksharas in these brackets, which I have conjecturally supplied, are entirely broken away, 
Here about three aksharas are broken away. & Metro of Persos 28-26: Slöka (Anushtabb). 
The word in these brackets is entirely broken away. 10 Originally paraddatt. Was engraved. u Of the ingoription C. an impression was given to me some years ago by Dr. Burgess. 
13 See also Dr. Führer: Most Antiquities and Inscriptions in the North-Western Provinces and ( pp. 185 and 263.

THREE GRANTS OF GOVINDACHANDRA, 
A-PÂLİ PLATES OF GOVINDACHANDRA AND HIS MOTHER 
RÂLHANADÊVÎ, OF [VIKRAMA-JSAMVAT 1189. These plates were found at the village of Pali in the Dburiàpâr purgana of the Bansgaon tahsil of the Gôrakhpur district of the North-Western Provinces, and were in January 1895 presented to the Lucknow Museum by the Collector, Dr. Hoey, who had obtained them through Pirthipal Rai, the Zamîndár. They are two in number, each of which measures about 1'15" broad by 10" high, and is inscribed on one side only. The plates have raised rims, and the writing, in consequence, is in an excellent state of preservation throughout. There is & ring hole in the centre of the lower part of the first plate and a corresponding hole in the centre of the upper part of the second plate, but the ring on which the plates were strung is missing. With the plates, however, is preserved a circular seal, about 27" in diameter, which bears in high relief, across the centre, the legend $[***]mad-G[0]vindachandradeva, in Nagari letters about the high; above the legend, the figure of a Garuda, squatting down and facing to the proper right; and below the legend, a conch-shell. Baob plate contains 17 lines of well executed writing. The size of the letters is about " The characters aro Någarî, and the language is Sanskrit. As regards orthography, the letter ) is everywhere denoted by the sign for v; the dental sibilant is frequently employed instead of the palatal, and the palatal occasionally instead of the dental; and j is used instead of y in the word jäti, h. 20. 
The inscription is one of the Paramabhatjáraka Maharajadhiraja Paraméśvara Govinda chandradêve. The king records in it that, after bathing in the Sati at the ghatta of the god Svapnêsvara, on the occasion of the Akshaya-tfitiyâ festival in the bright half of the month Vaisakha, he made over to his mother, the Mahardjñi Râlhanadhvi, ten náluk as of land) in the village of Guduvi, in the Gôyara pattala of the Ônavala pathaka, as a gift for the Thakkura Jayapâlašarman, son of the Thakic ura Iudråditya and son's son of the Thakkura, Pêvalaba, a Brahman of the Mudgala gótra, whose three pravuras were Maudgalya, Âógirasa and Bhârm yaśya.- The taxes specially mentioned in line 26) as due to the donee are the bhágabhogakara and pravnnikara. In line 34 the inscription is dated, in figures only, on Saturday, the 8th of the dark half of Jyaishtha of the year 1189. The grant was written by the Thakkura Vishnu. 
The date in line 34 regularly corresponds, for the Kärttikadi Vikrama-Samvat 1189 expired and the půrninânta Jyaishtha, to Saturday, the 29th April A.D. 1183, when the 8th tithi of the dark half ended 15 h. 48 m. after mean sunrise. The preceding Akshaya-tritiya, on which the donation was made, fell on Sunday, the 9th April A.D. 1133, when the third tithi of the bright half of Vaišâkba commenced 1 h. 17 m. and ended 23 h. 5 m. after mean Bunrise. 
The localities I am unable to identify.-- From the present inscription it appears that the pattala, so often mentioned in cognato grants, was a subdivision of the pathaka, a term which does not occur in the inscriptions of the kings of Kananj hitherto published, but which is met with also in another Pali plate of Govindachandra that will be referred to below. Another unusual term in this grant is náluka, in line 19. This word apparently is derived from, and is equivalent to the Sanskpit nalva, a measure of distance equal to 400 (or, according to others. 100, or 120) hastas. The same term occurs, both in the form náluka and in the abbreviated form ndly, in the Kahla (now Lucknow Museum) plates of the (Kalachuri?) Maharaja dhirdja såghadêra, the successor of the Mandrájddhiraja Maryadásågaradêva, of V. 1135, of whicb Dr. Führer has kindly sent me an impression. 
1 In other inscriptions the name is both Balkanadául and Rálhaddot; see above, Vol. IV. p. 113. * The tithi, on which the donation was made, therefore was a krhaya-tithi * See Gupta Intcr, p. 178, 2008 1.

B.-MACHALÎSHAHR PLATE OF GOVINDACHANDRA 
OF [VIKRAMA-]SAMVAT 1201. This is a single plate which was found in September 1888, in a field close to a small hamlet geven miles north of Machhlishahr (Ghiswa) in the Jaunpur district of the North-Western Provinces, and is now in the Lucknow Museum. It measures abont 1'37" broad by 11%" high, and is engraved on one side only. In the centre of the upper part it has a ring-hole, through which passes a ring, with a circular seal which is about 2" in diameter and bears the same legend and emblems as the seal of the inscription A., but apparently not 80 well preserved The plate contains 29 lines of writing which, on the whole, is well preserved. The size of the letters is between 1" and " The characters are Nagari, and the language is Sanskrit. The writer has done his work well, and in respect of orthography, therefore, it need only be stated that, except in the word babhranur= in line 9, the letter b is denoted by the sign for v, and that the dental sibilant is occasionally employed instead of the palatal. 
This is another inscription of the Paramabhatjáraka Maharajadhiraja Paranêsvara Gôvindachandradêva, who records that, on Monday, the Akshaya-tritiya tithi of the bright half of the month Vaisakha of the year 1201 (given both in words and in figures after bathing in the Ganges at Benares, be granted the village of Pêrôha in the Mahagoya nattalů to the Pandita Vamsadharaśarman, son of the Pandita Padmanabha and son's son of the Pandita Bharata, a Brâhman of the Kasyapa gótra, whose three prararas were Kaśyapa, À vatsara and Naidhruva. The taxes specified (in line 20) are the Bhagubhôgakaro. pravanikara and turushkadanda. The grant (tâmra) was written by the Kdyastha Dhandhüka.? 
About the exact equivalent of the date I am somewhat doubtful. It is true that, for the Chaitrádi Vikrama-Samyat 1201 current, the date would regularly correspond to Monday. the leth April A.D. 1143, when the third tithi of the bright half of Vaisakha ended 21 h. 52 m. after mean sunrise. But as current years are only quoted very exceptionally, and as for the Karttikadi Vikrama-Samyat 1202 expired the date would correspond to Monday, the 15th April A.D. 1146, which was entirely occupied by the third tithi of the bright balf of Vaikikba, I am rather inclined to assume that this is really the day on which the grant was made, and that in the inscription the year 1201 has been quoted erroneously instead of 1202,3 
Regarding the localities I can only say that the Mahasøya pattala of this inscription undoubtedly is the same district which in an inscription of Jayachchandrais called the Mahasa pattald.

It measures about 1'52" broad ho Il high, and is inscribed on one side only. At the lower proper left corner a square piece, ebont II" broad by 24" high, is broken away, causing the loss of about four akshards at the end of each of the lines 19-25; otherwise the plate is well preserved.

TA. 
plate contains 25 lines of writing. The size of the letters is about " The characters are Nagari, and the language is Sanskrit. The writer and engraver have done their work in & rather slovenly manner so that the text contains a large number of minor mistakes. As regards orthography, the letter b is denoted by the sign for v, the dental sibilant is often employed instead of the palatal, j is used instead of y in -parjantaḥ, 1. 16, and the word sékhara is written séshara, in line 19. 
This is another inscription of the Paramabhattdraka Mahúrájádhiraja Paramétvara Govindachandradêva. The king records in it that, on Tuesday, the full-moon tithi of Kârttika of the year 1208 (given both in words and in figures), his queen, the Patfamahadevi Maharaj i Gösaladevi, endowed with all royal prerogatives, after bathing in the Ganges at Benares near (the temple of) the god Lôlárka, in the presence of that deity, with the king's consent, gave the village of Gaţiara in the Bhimamaylltása . , : pattala to the Thalckura Apatašarman, son of the Thakura . and son's son of the Thukkura Kulhệ, a Bråhman of the Vasishtha gôtra and student of the Chhandôga súkhá (of the Sáma-vêda), who had come from Påtaliputra. The taxes specified (in line 22) are the bhagabhôgakara and pravanikara. The writer's name either was not given or is broken away at the end of the inscription. 
The date is irregular ;6 for the full-moon tithi of Kärttika of Vikrama-Samvat 1208 current ended 17 h. 43 m. after mean sunrige of Monday, the 6th November A.D. 1150, and that of Vikrama-Samvat 1208 expired, 3 h. 58 m. after mean sunrise of Saturday, the 27th October A.D. 1151. The date would be incorrect also for Vikrama-Samvat 1209 expired. but correct for both 1206 and 1210 
Of the localities, Pâtaliputra is the modern Patna in the Patna district of Bengal ; the village Gatiara and the pattalà in which it was situated I am unable to identify,

No. 16.- SIX EASTERN CHALUKYA. COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTIONS. 
BY F. KIELHORN, PR.D., LL.D., C.I.E.; GÖTTINGEN. A.~ÉDÉRU PLATES OF VIJAYÂDITYA II. 
[4.D, 799-843.110 These plates were found, about twenty-five years ago, at the village of Êļéru (the End of the Indian Atlas, map 94, long. 80° 48' E., lat. 16° 43' N.) in the Nazividu Zamind&ri the Kistna district of the Madras Presidency, and they are preserved now in the Mai Museum. The inscription which they contain has been already published, by Pandit S. Natesa Sastri, in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. XIII. p. 55 ff. ; 11 I re-edit it from an excel impression, supplied to me by Dr. Holtzsch. 
These are three copper-plates, the first and last of which are inscribed on one side and each of which measures about 7" broad by 25" high. The plates have slightly raised

and are strung on a ring which had not been cut yet when the impression was taken by Dr. Hultzsch. The ring is about 3}" in diameter and s" thick, and has its ends secured in the base of an elliptical seal, about 3" by 15" in diameter. The seal bear's across its breadth the legend $71. Tribuuvarakumsa (foronáinkusu), with, below it, an expanded lotus flowor, and, above it, the sun within the moon's crescent.-- The writing, which is rather roughly engrayed, is, on the whole, well preserved. The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets, and are of the regular type of the period and part of the country to which the inscription belongs. As regards individual letters, it may be stated that for kl (which uccars ju prarakhan, l. 15, and in khandika, 1.21) and for b we have throughout the older square forms, and that, with perhaps one exception, the older, not the later cursive, form is also used in the case of l. It may moreover be noted that the sign for b is generally open on the left (or proper right) side -a form of b, which is employed throughout already in the Chipurupalle plates of Vishnuvardhana I. of A.D. 632 -- and that occasionally a similarly open sigui is used for 1, 0.g. in Dharmmaj[á]nuja, 1. 11, and a{dijīlaptir, 1, 25. Final forms of consouants occur for n in pramukh án, 1. 15, and perhaps for an iu sva-dalt[1*791, 1. 27, and vasundharan, L 28. The 
1 
of three verses at the end, the inscription is in prose. The text generally is plain, but contains a number of mistakes, due to carelessness of either the writer or the engrayer. Whether the word Berita ka, which in line 15 occurs in the place of the usual ráshtrakútra, is correct, or not, I am unable to decide. In respect of orthography, it may suffice to state that tho Dravidiau / is used in kaludhauta, 1. 12, and in the names Chalukyanum, 1. 4, Palla-blatis**truk[4*lya, 1. 20, and Bolarenduvati, 1. 24 ; that the sign of the medial ki is frequently omitted ;' and that the word padma is spelt patma, in line 9. 
The inscription is one of the Eastern Chalukya Vijayâditya [II. Narendramfigarâja), the son of Vishnuvardhana (IV.Jand son'a son of Vikramarama (i..., apparently, Vijayaditya I.). It records the grant, on the occasion of a solar eclipse, of part of the village of Va[nd]rupite[y]u in the Kanderuvádi-vishaya, to a Brâhman named Palla-bhatta raka, an inhabitant of Minamini. The Ajñapti (or dứtuka) of the grant was Bolama. 
The inscription is not dated. Of the localities, none of which have been identified, the Kanderuvadi (or ovâţi) vishaya is mentioned in South-Ind. Inscr. Vol. I. p. 40, 1. 43, and n. 45. 1.21, and was most probably mentioned also at the end of line 16 of the inscription published ibid. p. 33 and Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. p. 415, which mentions the villages of Vasnu rupite[y]16 and Korraparu (or parru) of the present inscription. Below, p. 129, text ). 23, mention is made of the Uttarakaņderuvadi vishaya. 
1 I refer to the sign for ly used in -gan-dlakantoya in line 20, which comes very near to the Inter cursive form. 
See Plate xxvii. of Dr. Burnell's South Indian Paleography. Occasionally the open forn of the square boccors also in other early Eastorn 94 well as Western Chalukya inscriptions. It is met with also ill Pallars and Enstern Garga inscriptions, and is used throughout in the Chikkulla plates of Vikramdactia varman II. (above, Vol, IV., 195), while in the Godavari plates of Prithivimila (Jour. Bo. As. Soc. Vol. XVI. p. 110) it cure oply once or perhaps twice, out of six times. 
& On the open y see below, p. 122. 
4 The only important omission of the sign for d occurs at the end of line ), where it might seriu doubtful whether the proper pame, given there, should be read Vikramarama or Vikranardna. In favour of the former reading one might perhaps quote the name Vishnurama which OCCilis above, Vol. IV. p. 310, II. 3 and 4 of the text; but the fact that in the present inscription the name ir liu mediately precoled by the word abhiria, in my opinion, renders it certain that Tikramaráma is really intended. 
See below, p. 120, note 10.

B. MASULIPATAM (?) PLATES OF VIJAYÂDITYA II. 
[4.D. 844-888.] There is no definite information as to where these plates were found, or what became of them; but, judging from the dimensions, this may perhaps be a grant which is entered as follows in & memorandum of Sir Walter Elliot:"5. Inscription ou 5 plates, received from Mr. Porter, Collector of Masulipatan, 19th December 1846 ; Vijayaditya. Seal, a Boar, and 
Tribhurundinkusa. Length 9; breadth, 35. Weight, 258 rupees." I edit the inscription from Sir W. Elliot's own impressions, supplied to me by Dr. Fleet to whom I also owe the preceding iuformation. 
These apparently are five copper-plates, the first and last of which are inscribed on one side only, and each of which measures 91" broad by about 35" high. They were strung on a ring for which there is a hole on the proper right side of each plate. The writing on the origiual plates andopbtedly is Tell preserved, but the impressions contain some partially 
rast, which was not cleaned out before taking the impressions...The writing is well done, and carefully eagraved. The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets, of the time and part of the country to which the inscription belongs. As regards individaal letters, the chief points to note are, that for kh and I everywhere the later, cursive forms are used, while for 5 we hope the older square form; and that the signs for both b and ; throughout are open on the left (or proper right) side. Of the open 8 I have spoken above, p. 119. The open j is used occasionally already in the Edêru plates of Vijayaditya II. (above, p. 120), and in the Abadanakarama plates of Vishnuvardhana V. (Ind. Ant. Vol. XIII. p. 186, e.g. in kanadiraju!, 1. 30). It is also found Dow and then, more or less developed, in Eastern Ganga inscriptions, e.g. in lines 1 and 2 of the Chicacole plates of Indravarman of the year 146 (?) and in line 25 of the Vizagapatan plates of Dêvêndravarman of the year 254 (ibid. Vol. XIII. p. 123, and Vol. XVIIl. p. 144); and it occurs pretty frequently in the Chikkulla plates of Vikramêndravarman II. (above, Vol. IV. p. 195), which have also the open b. And both the open ; and the open b are used throughout in the two Båņa inscriptions, published in Ind. Ant. Vol. X. p. 39, which therefore, in this respect, come nearer to the present inscription than any other records examined by me. Of final consonants which are not joined with a following letter our inscription only contains ť (in kênachit, l. 29) and " (in pramukhán, l. 18, pártthiréndrán,

9 Excepting the word which precedes the name Tirkkošarmmerah in line 20, and one or two akahara, in the nawes of villages, the illegible passages cause little difficulty. 
I do not renture to quote with coufidence tha Nellore district plates of Fishnuvardhana II. of A.D. 664 (Ind. Ant. Vol. VII. p. 186), where the open j seems to occte fa Bháradvaja, l. 16, and spamuk)-ding. 1. 67 liha Tables is Dr. Burnell's and Prof. Bünler's works on Indian palmography contain go specimen of the open i. 
On the Plate facing page 167 of Ind. Ant. Vol. X. there are photolithographs of two abort Pattadakal ingeriptions, one of which has the ordinary open j (consisting of three separate lines), while the other furnisher oningtunce of that peculiar form of the open y, which has a vertical line in the middle and three horizontal lines to the right of the vertical line. The origiu of the latter form of j, which, together with the ordinary open i. ngen e.g, in the spurious Merkare pletes (ibid, Vol. 1. p. 362), is well shewn by the different forms of ,. emnian in the Chicacole plates of Derendraparuan (ibid. Vol. XIII. p. 275 ; compare the different forms of in Ndoardin, I. 23, nija, 1.7, and vijaya, 1.1). The origin of the Inter, cursive ), in my opinion, is equally well oben by some forins of j in the Alamayda plates of Anantavarman of the year 804 (above, Vol. III. p. 18: com foring of 1 in 8.9. janita jaya, 1. 6, and rija, 1. 8). Perhaps I may state here that a form of j, which comes near indeed to the later cursive ), in used already in the grant of Attivarman (Ind. Ant. Vol. IX. p. 102.&.a. ir jana, 1, 3, and yajus, 1. 6), which shere an early form of the Grantha sinh 
La which shere an early form of the Granths alphabet and is in my opinion, not later than A.D. 650.

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. The asylum of the whole world, the Mahardja Vijayaditya (1, 6), who adorned the family of the Chalukyas (1.5) who are of the Mânavya gôtra and are Håritiputras (1. 1), was a fire of destruction to the Ganga family, and, as he broke the frenzy of the Kalisa, was named Chåluky-Arjuna (1. 7).

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
[Vol. V. 
(V. 1.) Valorous like a lion, he with his unsheathed sharp sword split oper (the frontal globost of the lordly elephants-- his adversaries ; the fire of his wrath is not extinguished unless it is sprinkled with the tears of the sorrow-stricken wives of his enemies. 
His dear son was the asylum of all mankind, the Maharaja Vishnuvardhana (1. 10). 
(V. 2.) When he ascends his elephant, his enemies ascend the mountain-tops; when his arm takes the sword, the hands of the young women of his adversaries take op the chowries; when he knits his brows, the black bees make honey in the palace of his adversary; when the war-drum is sounded in his ebode, the jackals howl in the abode of his opponent. 
His dear son whos excels the moon in beanly, the earth in endurance, the tree of paradise in generosity, the sno in splendour, the lion in bravery, and the sea in greatness of disposition- the asylum of the whole world, the Maharāja Vijayaditya (1. 17), thus issues & command to all the cultivators, headed by the Rashtrakütas, in the Gudra vârs-vishaye : 
"Be it known to you! On the occasion of an eclipse of the moon (1. 27), the village of Tranda(pa ?]ra (1.28) has been given by Us, with exemption from all taxes, to the Taittiriye householder Vinayadišarman (1.27), a son of Damodarasarman and son's son of the inhabitant of Urputaru (1. 19), the .... Tarkasarman, who belongs to the Kansika gótra and Åpustamba sitra. 
(V. 4.) He has conquered the host of the six enemiegé of mankind who have subdued all the world; when she came to him, the Glory of holiness forgot even the lotus-born Brahman; in his society the assemblage of virtues find pleasure, such as they have nowhere experienced ; true to his word, he in jest even does not give utterance to false speech. 
(V.5.) When on the field of battle, strewn with horses, soldiers and infuriated elephants that were strack down by various weapons, (the kings) had slain Mangi, who bad defeatod the whole host of hostile chiefs and in the excess of his fury bad ridiculed the king's liberality: bravery and power, he was well pleased with the marvellous advice of this best one of the twice 
born." 
The boundaries aro (1.28): On the east and south, Angalûru; on the west, Velpůru ;and on the north, Chavi[ta?]paru. 
The rest of the inscription warns the people not to obstruct this grant ; quotes three benedictive and imprecatory verses, ascribed to Vyåse; (in verse 9) gives the name of the djñapti of the grant, Påndarânga, who for his prowess and valour in war is compared to Bibhatan, t.e. Arjana ; (in , 10) contains & prayer for the welfare of the people and the progress of religion ; and (in . 11) records that this edict (sasana), by order of the king Vijayaditya, was written by the foremost of goldsmiths, Katta[y]a, the son of Madhava and son's son of ládna.

" 
1 There is no donbt that this was present to the mind of the author of the verse, compare, e.g., Plaavadatta, p. 102, hari-khoranakharapidáritakumbhasthala-vikalavdrana. According to Dr. Fleet in Ind. An. Fol. XX. P. 101, the word nigádnipa would seem to have a double meaning, and to indicate algo defeat of some hostile chief of the Nigaa." 
* The presduce of the black bres in the palace of the enemy As well as the bowling of the jackals portend evil. Compara Barshacharita, Bombay ed. pp. 180 and 181, oaodáird foándr rajayan

8 I only give the general sense of verge 3, which I cannot conetrpe. The king was mahd-tattua on account of big noble disposition ; the sea is so, because it contains a number of big orestarte. 
+ Here one yord, apparently & name, is partly illegible in the original. $ Comparu dauth-indo Impor. Vol. I. p. 35, note 8. 
6 Tbe original bas Parkdruhabhi'; compard, e.g., 4mbloj abhava and Jalajabhava in Ind. ant. Vol. XII p. 92, 1. 40, and p. 98, 1. 46. 
Accordiog to the dictionaries, the word jorhe, in classical Sanskrit would seem to be used only as an adverb in the form joshan; but it cocure &9 & substantive, in the sense of sukha, c.g. in Barshacharita, Bombay ed. A, 169, 1. 8. 
• This has necessarily to be supplied ; the king, of course, is Vijayaditya bimeelf.

SIX EASTERN CHALU KYA GRANTS. 
127 
C. BEZVADA PLATES OF CHÂLUKYA-BHÍMA I. 
[A.D. 888-818.1 These plates were found on the 25th June 1897 in the rock-hewa chamber of the quarry compound at Bezvada, in the Kistna district of the Madras Presidency, and were sent to Di. Hintzsch by Mr. J. K. Batten, I.C.S., the Acting Collector of the Kistna district. I edit the inscription which they contain from an excellent impression, supplied to me by Dr. Hultzsch. 
These are five copper-plates, each of which measures about 7" broad by 3" high. Plates 2.5ste inscribed on both sides, but the writing on the second side of the fifth plate is less than half a line. The first plate is inscribed on the second side only, and on the first side contains, from the proper right to the left, representations of coach-shell, the sun, and a club.. With perhaps the exception of the first plate, the plates are quasi-palimpsesta. On the plates 2-4 the writing which had first been engraved on them is well beaten in, so that only few traces of it remain; but on both sides of the fifth plate the original writing is still so clearly seen that muigh of it may be made out withont any difficulty. The characters of this original writing dosely resemble those which were afterwards engraved on the plates ; and this, together with the fact that the words at the bottom of the second side of the fifth plate are 80. sarvvalókádraya. Ari-Vishnu arddhana-ma hárá], in my opinion, leaves no doubt that these plates originally mere used for another grant of Bhima I., which either was pot completed or for some reason or other was cancelled. The plates have high rims, and are strong on a ring, which had not been ante vet when this record came into Dr. Hultzsch's hands. The ring is about 41" in diameter and I thick, and has its ends secured in the back of a circular seal, about 24" in diameter The seal bears, in relief, the legend fri-Tribhuvan[u*]mkusak, with a flower below it, and, above it, a conchant boar wbicb faces to the proper left and is surmounted by the sun and the moon's crescent, while behind it is an elephant-goad. The writing is well preserved throughont. The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets, of the time and part of the country to which the inscription belongs. As regards individual lettere, kh, j, 6 and I are denoted through out by the later, cursive signs; but for the initial i in Indra, 1. 8) we have bere still the Bartior form, consisting of two horizontal dots with a wavy lino above them. Of special signs for final consonants the inscription only contains one, for » (in dattavan, 1, 21, but not in pratápavan, 1.46): and of letters which occur more rarely, the initial , ai and 8 (in Isanatah and Airiniya mantha, 1. 32, and on, 1.1). The size of the letters is about -The language is Sanskrit. except that some Telugu words occur in the proper names. In addition to five benedictive and imprecatory verses, the text contains one verso referring to the donor and another which gives the name of the Agñapti; the rest is in prose, but in lines 15 and 17 reads as if the official who drey no the grant had had verses before him. The text is full of minor mistakes. In respot of orthography, it will suffice to pote the doubling, before y, oft in Sattya draya, I. 6, and Vijayadittya, l. 13, of n in tânny-éva, 1. 37, and of l in nirmmdllya, 1. 44; the doubling of s before kin vašasskardni, 1. 44; the doubling of m after anusvåra in teshin mmayd, 1. 40; the employment of tand d for the corresponding aspirates in saprárttito (for samprartthitó), 1. 21, párttivendrán 1. 42, dharmmártta-, 1. 44, and sdduh, 1. 45; and the use of the palatal for the dental sibilant in sahasrani, 1. 36. 
The insoription is one of the Eastern Chalukya Bhima (1.) Vishnuvardhana (neually called Ohalukya-Bhima), of whom no other inscription has yet been found. After having stated (in verse), in & general way, that at the time of his coronation (patfabandha) king Bhima gave away a village in perpetuity, it formally records that the Maharajadhiroja Vishna. Tardhana granted the village of Kûkiparra in the Uttarakanderuvadi-vishaya to a student 
I The plates were found together with a set of plates professing to contuin a grant of Vishnuvardhana Fil. which I consider to be aparious. 
See line 21 of the text of the present inscription.

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. Om. Adoration to Nariyana ! Kubja-Vishnuvardhana (1.7)-- the brother of Sauyaslaya Vallabhåndıra, who adorned the family of the Chalukyas (1.6) who are of the Månevya gôtra and are Håritiputras (1.2)-- (seigned) for eighteen years ; his son Jayasimha-yallabha (1.8) for thirty-three years; Vishnuvardhana (1.9), the dear son of his younger brother Indra-bhattaraka, for nine years; his son Mangi-yuvarâja (1. 9) for twenty-five years; his son Jayasinha (1.10) for thirteen years ; Kokkili (1. 11), his younger brother from a different mother, for six months ; his eldest brother Vishụuvardhana (1. 12), having expelled the younger brother, for thirty-seven years; his son Vijayaditya-bhattâraka (1. 13) for eighteen years; his son Vishnurdja (1, 14) for thirty-six years ; his son Vijayaditya (1.14), who built a bandred and eight temples of (Siya) Narendrëśvara, for fortyl0 years; his son Kali-Vishnuvardhana (1. 16) for one year and a half; (and) his son Vijayaditya (1. 16) for forty-four years. Bhima (1. 18) is the son of his brother, the Yuvarája Vikramaditya. 
(V. 1.) That glorious bero, by whose fame all quarters, the earth and the sky are whitened as by the moon's Tays, and who gladdens the learned with the excellent god of love, that glorious home of victory, king Bhima, at the time of his coronation, well pleased, has given a village in perpetuity, requested to do so. 
He, the asylum of all mankind, Vishnuvardhana (1. 22), the Mahärájádhirdja, Paramètuaru and Paramadhattaraka, who is most devoted to religion, having called together all the oultivators, headed by the Rashtrakútan, who inhabit the Uttarakanderuvâţi-vishaya, thus issues & command to them (1.25). 
* Be it known to you! The village of Kükiparžu (1. 27) has been given by as, with exemption from all taxes, to the student of the kramapátha Potamayya, the son of Drðpabhutts who is the son of Rēvamayya, & member of the Kauņdinya gôira and a Vedic scholar (inhabiting) Ummarakanțhiből (1.25).”

SIX EASTERN CHALUKYA GRANTS.

The boundaries are (1.29): On the east, the Pộtaryangari-chepuvu (tank); on the south east, the Paruvula-gunta (tank); on the south, the Chaki-choruvu (tank); ou the south-west, the boundary-line of 1; on the west, the Chintaroni-cheruvu (tank) ; on the north-West, the Juvvi-gunta (tank); and on the north and north-east, the Airiviya-gunta (tank). 
The rest of the inscription warns the people not to obstruct this grant; quotes five benedictive and imprecatory verses, ascribed to Vyåsa ; (in verse 7) gives the name of the Ajacpti of the grant, Kadeyarêja, whose grandfather was Påndaráiga; and records the name of the writer, Kondacharya. 
D.-MASULIPATAM FLATES OF AMMA I. 
[A.D. 918-925.) These plates were found, some twenty years ago, in the vernacular record room of the Collector's office at Masulipatam, in the Kistna district of the Madras Presidency, and thoy are preserved now in the Madras Museum. The inscription which they contain has been already published, by Mr. R. Sewell, in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VIII. p. 77 ff.;" I re-edit it from an oxcellent impression, taken and supplied to me by Dr. Fleet. 
These are three copper-plates, the first and last of which are inscribed on one side only, und each of which measures about 8." broad by 45" high. The plates bave raised rims, and are struug on a ring which had been cut before this record came into Dr. Fleet's hands in the year 1884. The ring is about 53" in diameter and 1" thick ; it is joined to a circular seal which is about 32" in diameter. The seal bears, in relief on a slightly countersunk surface, the legend éri-Tribhuvan[*] inkusa ; below the legend, a floral device ; immediately above the legend, a boar, standing and facing to the proper right; and above the boar, an elephant-goad surmounted by the moon's crescent. With the exception of a small part of the first plate the writing of which is somewhat corroded, the plates are well preserved.-- The writing and cugraving are good. The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets, of the time and part of the country to which the inscription bulongs. Tor kh, j, b and I we have throughout the later, cursive signs. The initial i does not ocour in the text. Of the three final consonants which occur, 1 and m are donoted by special signs in mástin, 11. 9 and 13, trimsatam, II. 10 and 11, and chatváriinsatam, l. 12 and 14), while for £ the ordinary sign for ta is used, with the sign of viráma above it in Kumäravat, 1. 27, and anima(na) bat, 1, 29). The size of the letters is about , --The language is Sanskrit. Besides two benedictive and implecatory verses, the text contains eight verses treating of the donor and the donce and their ancestors; the rest is in prose. In respect of orthography, it may be noted that the rules of suidhi have been frequently neglected, and that there is a fairly large number of other minor mislakes, omissions of letters, etc. A special point which may be drawn attention to dis, that after an anysvára 4 cousonant is doubled in Manggi, l. 8, Venggi and Trikalingga, 1. 17, panohcharinsatin, 1.8, kimchcha, 1. 30, and in vatsarándă rinija., 1. 16, but not in other places where the same rule might have been followed. 
The inscription is one of the Eastern Chalukya Ammaraja [I.] Vishnuvardhana.lt records that the king granted the village of Drujjúru in the Pennåta vadi-Vishaya to Mahakala, 
general, and son of a foster-sister, of Amnarija's grandfather) Chalukya-Bhima (or Bhima I.). The Ajñapté of the grant was (tbe ?). Katakarija. 
See abova, p. 129, note 11. 
Compare also Dr. Fleet in Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. p. 266, K. 
• The same rule is observed once in regard to m) in the precediug inscription C. We also find it occa rionally observed eg. in the inscriptions pablished in South-Ind. Inscr. Vol. I p. 89 ff., and Ind. dute Vol. XIII. p. 213 f. See also above, p. 107. 
* See above, Vol. IV. P. 309, note 1.

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
[TOL V. 
The inscription is not dated. Of the localities, the Pennata râdi rishaya is mentioneci also in Ind. Ant. Vol. VII. p. 16, 1. 39. The village of Drujjūru has by Nr. Serrell been identified! with the village of Zuzzúru in the Nandigawa tåluka of the Kistna district, the 'Joodjoor' of the Iulian Atlas, map 75, long. 80° 28' E., Int. 16° 44' N. Mr. Serrell may be right, but, except ing Gooteemookola which may be Gottiprôlu. I do not find the names of the villages which in the inscription are said to form the boundaries of Drujjůru, anywhere near the " Joodjoor' of the map,

* According to Ir, Sewell, a village named Tadigummi is west (not east) of Zuzzúru ; and east (not west) of it, on the east side of forest-covered hills which would thus have been included in the grant, is the villaga of Malkápuram." 
Fron Dr. Fleet's impresions, 
• Here, and with similar accusative case below, we have to supply & verb mending he reigned. Read satan tershani. 
Here, and in other places below, the rules of sandhi bave not been observed. 7 Read Mangis, 
Read panchan 
9 Here one would expect varohani. 10 Hers the word sata has been omitted ; compare the text of the preceding inbcription, line 15, and South-Ind. Insor. Vol. I. p. 39, 1, 13. 
11 This sign of punctuation should be struck out. 1 Here, again, one would expect varshani.

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. Commencing with the words - Dlar the whole world be blessed !," lines 1-14 give the gencalogy, with the lengths of the reigns, as far as the Maharaja Vijayaditya, the son of Kali-Vishnuvardhana, in substantially the same nianzer as the preceding inscription C. 
(V. 1.) From his (ie. Vijayaditya's) younger brother, the Yuvaraja Vikramaditya, sprang that mighty fire-brand to the cotlon- tbe host of his adversaries, the incomparable king Bhima, who filled the horizon with the fame of his many excellent qualities for thirty years. 
His son Vijayaditya (1, 17) Tent to heaven when he had ruled the Vêngi-mandala, joined with the Trikalinga forest, for six mouths. 
(Vs. 2-4.) To him was born a sou, able to bear the burden of the earth, king Ammarâja, who rules the whole surface of the earth. The kings in a body have resorted to the shade of his lotus-feet; the bow with which he chastises his onemies is glorified in the three worlds. Even the Vidyadhari siu, to the late his fame which, white like the jasmine and the moon, hag reddened the surface of the caril, the famo of him whose enemies lave perished. 
He, the asylum of all mankind, the Mahúrája Vishịuvardhana (1. 22), having called together all the cultivators, headed by the Rashtrakütus, who inbabit the Pennatavadi-vishaya, thus issues a command to them :-- 
"Be it known to you! 
(Vs. 5-8.) King Chalukya-Bhima had a foster-mother, named Nagipóti; she was (to him) like a second earth, like & Tarrior endowed with endurance. She had a daughter, named Gamakäm bå, like anto Ambika, who dunk her mother's milk, sharing it with king Bhima. She brought forth a son, endowed with strength like Kamira, the high-spirited Hahakala, (who became) a general of king Bhima. In battle where fire is produced by the clashing together of the opponents' arms, going before his master, this brave one more than once has Annihilated the enemy's army. 
To lim the village of Drujjúru (1. 31) has been given by Us, with exemption from all taxes." 
The boanderies are (1.32) : On the east, the boundary.line of Talugummi; op the south, the boundarf-line of Gottiprolu; on the west, the boundary-line of Malkapôramu; and on the north, the br-an Zary-line of Adupu. 
The rest of the inscription warns the people not to obstruct this grant ; quotes two benedictive and imprecatory vergee, ascribed to Vyåsa; and records that (the ?) Kațakarája was the Ajñapti (of this grant).

SIX EASTERN CHALUKYA GRANTS. 
135 
These are throo copper-plates, the first and last of which are iuscriled on one sido only, and each of which meisuros about 75" brond by 31" high. They baru hiylı rims, and are strung on 9. ring, about 42" in diameter and thick, which had been cut already when the original camo under Dr. Flvet's notice. To the ring is attached a circular seal which is about 23" iu din nueter. It bears, in relief only countersunk surface, across the contre, the legend fri Tribhuvanitikuś.i ; above the legend, the sun and moon, two sceptres (or perhaps lamp stands, or chowrica), au elephant-gord, and a boar, standing and facing to the proper left : and below the legend, a conch-shell frid a foral devico. The engraving is puod; the letters throughout show marks of the working of the tool. The writing for tho greiter part is well preserved ; bat sirles i, üia and üli, towards the ends of tho lines, have been subjected to the actiou of fire or some corrosive fluid, and in a few places the Grst and third plates are corrolur? right through. The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets, of the time unt part of the country to which the inscription belongs. The consonants throughout have the later, cursive forras, and the later forn is used also in the case of the initial i (in ittiaui, 1. 22). The sign of the medial au is very similar to one of the signs of tho medial 6, so that it is difficult to distinguish between tho two signs. Special sigus are used for the final n in müsün, 11. 9 and 15), and 1 (iu ofrimi latan, 1. 7. Ovi insulim, l. 8, etc.), but not for the inalt (in policyat, 11, 7 and 17), which is denoted by the ordinary sign for ta, with the sign of virênra above it. The size of the letters is about 1". The language is Sanskrit, except that one or two Telugu Fords ocour in the description of the boundaries, in linas 32 and 33. In line 28 we have the unusual word purcha-zdiri, the meaning of which apparoatly is similar to that of the more common pañcha- 
kla. Besides two benedictise and imprecatory Terses, tho test contains nine versos treating of the donor and the donee; the rest is in prose. The grant has been written out somewhat carelessly, and in lines 8 and 9 contains tiro grossly incorrect state uonts. In respect of orthography, too, the text shots a fairly large number of unistakes, owing o the disregard of the rules of saindhi, the omission of siuglo letters and whole syllables, cto. 
The inscription is one of the Eastern Chalukya Châlukya-Bhima (II.) Vishnu vardhana, but the Arst of theso tvo nanes does not actually occur in the text, which describes the king only as 'the son of Môlâmbâ and Vijayaditya.' It records that the king, on the occasion of the sun's progress to the north, granted a liell at the vilkogo cf Åkulamannaņdu in the Gudravåra-vishaya to a studeut of the dramapdiha zamod Viadamayya, a son of the Sóma-sacrificer Madhava, who was a son of Tyakkiya, a student of ike kramapátha and inhabitant of Vangiparru. No Ajiupti is mentioner, 
. The inscription is not dated. Of the localities, the Gudravüra vishaya bas been spoken of above, p. 123. The village of Vangiparra is mentioned also in Inl. Ant. Vol. XX. p. 416, 1. 26 ff.; perhaps it is Vangipuram, Indian Ailas, map 76, long 80° 27' E., lat. 10° 8' N. Åkala barnapdr, as Dr. Flest points out to me, is the “ Aukalmanaud' of map 95, long. 81° 10' E., at. 16° 15' N. 
The donee of this grant, Viddamayya, is the donce also of the Paganaparam grant of Chalukya-Bhima II., published ibil. Vol. XIII, p. 213 ff., in which in line 49) the name of his father's father is given as Tûrkama (not Tyákkiya).

He, the asylum of all mankind, Vishņuvardhana (1. 21), the Maharajadīsirdiju and Paranèsvaru, who is most devoted to religion, having called together the cultivators, headed by the Rishtrakútus, who inhabit the Gudravara-visbaya, thus issues a command to them (1.23); 
"Be it known to you (1. 32) ! 
(V8. 4-9.) There was an inhabitant of the great village of Vangiparru, Tyakkiya, a student of the kramapatha, of the Gautama lineage. His son was Madhava, a Sôma-sacrificer, devoted to Janårdana (Visbộu). His son, again, is Viddamayya, a student of the kramaputha, eminent in religious learning and full of manliness ; whose hospitality purifies the family to the seventh generatiou ;whose? sons and grandsons, youths eloquent at committee-assemblies, are honoured by the chief people who have made them serye on the committee of five; who engages in holy performances, follows Manu's guidance, and is not weary of repeating the Vedas and the syllable ôm.

. This seems to ino to indicate that Vijayaditya bad been inaugurated both as Fupardja and 98 king, the Corner by the necklet and the latter by tbe tying on of the tiara (pattabındha). At any rate, there can be po doubt that the kanthikd and the pattabandha are two separate insignia, Regarding the decklet (Icanthika) ne s sign of the wearer laving been appointed Fuvardja, compare South Ind.

F.-MASULIPATAM PLATES OF AMMA. II. 
[A.D. 945-970.) These plates also were found, some twenty years ago, iu the vernacular record room of the Collector's oflice at Masulipatam, and are now in the Madras Museum. The inscription which they contain has been already published, by Mr. R. Sewell, in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VIII. p. 74 ff. ;3 I re-edit it from two excellent impressions, taken and supplied to me by Dr. Fleet. 
These are three copper-plates, the first and last of which are inscribed on one side only, and each of which measures about 8" broad by 31" high. Thos bave high, very sharp rims, and are strung on a ring, about 41" in diameter and 3" thick, which had been cut already before this record came under Dr. Fleet's notice in the year 1884. To the ring is attached i circular Beal, about 23" in diameter. It bears, in relief on a countersunk surface, across the centre, the legend fri-Tri[61]uvaniškusa ; above the legend, a bour, standing and facing to the proper right, and surmounted by the sun; in front of the hoar, a conch-shell with the moon above it; and behind the boar, an elephant-gond; and below the legend, a floral device.--- The writing is good, and generally in an excellent state of preservation; but a small piece of the first plate is broken off at the lower proper right corner, causing the loss of two aksharas, which can be easily supplied. The characters belong to the southern class of alphabets, of the time and part of the country to which the inscription belongs. With regard to individual letters. it is sufficient to state that a special sign is used only for the final » (in mesin, 11. 8, 13 and 15, oddhatár, 1. 16, and dattavûn, l. 25). The size of the letters is between 1 and 7"- Tho language is Sanskrit, except that several Teluga words are used in the description of the boundaries, in lines 26-30. Besides one benedictory verse, four verses occur in the genealogical part of the text; the rest is in prose. The orthography does not call for any special remarks 
The inscription is one of the Eastern Chalukya Ammarája (II.) Vijayaditya, also called Raja-mahôndra. It records that the king granted some fields at the village of Påmbarru in 
The illegible words perhaps stated $1180 the field formerly belonged to Damodara, of whion Viddamas (although called his pautta) probably was & daughter's son. 
According to Campbell's Teloogoo Dictionary the Telugu -word Tidu means 'a rivulet, the branch of river ;' in Kanarese, the same word means the peak or top of a bill.' 
3 Compare also Dr. Fleet in Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. p. 271, Q. 
AI din doubtful about the form of the initial i wbich occurs towards the end of line 25. It has not come out clearly in the impressions, 
It should be noted that the sentence in lines 22-25, which records tho actual grant, although preceded by the usual ittham-diapayati, is not worded like an order, but merely states the fact that the king made the grant, and that the donor is spoken of in the third person, as Anamarája, instead of being cichoterl, in the ordinary way, by some form of the pronoun of the first person (ahan dattaván, or asmathiradattam), Moreover the first two words (atha tasydh, '1109 to the son of that Pannava) of the sentence suggeet the idea thut it was taken from some other record in which the donee's mother had already been spakca of, and that the grant was made in consequence of something or other, done by her or ber son.

No. 17.- CHEBROLU INSCRIPTION OF JAYA; 
V 
AFTER SAKA-SAMVAT 1135. 
By E. HULTESOR, PA.D. This inscription is engraved on the four faces of the right one among two pillars in fr of the gópura of the Nageśvara temple at Chộbrôlu in the Bapatla täluka of the Kistua distr I edit it from an excellent inked estampage, prepared in 1897 by Mr. H. Krishna Sastri, B The inscription is in very good preservation. The letters are so clear and well-formed tha can be read as easily 88 print. The alphabet is Telagu, and the languages are Sanskrit ve (lines 1-110 and 149-158) and Telugu prose (11, 110-149). 
The inscription opens with some invocations (verses 1-4). Then follows the ponenloo the (Kakatiya) king Ganapati, who traced his descent from the Sun (5.5), his son Manu (y and the family of the Raghus (v. 7 f.). The earliest historical ancestor, mentioned by me js Duriaya (.8). His son Beta (v. 8) is identical with Betma, alius Tribhuvanamalla, of Ekámranatha and Anmakonda inscriptions. After him ruled Prólo and his son Rudra (y Mahadeva, the uterine brother of the last (v.9), and Mabådéra's son Ganapati (v. 10), 
* Minor differences wbich may be mentioned are: In line 1 we here have the spelling Harit4. (inate Arti and in line 13 Kolla biganda (instead of Kollabhiganda) ; iu line 12 we have only Vikramd instead of awardia-Vikramaditya), and in lines 14 and 15 Tål-ddhipati und Táloddhipa (instead of le and Talang-rdig); moreover, in line 6 tke length of Jayasimha's reigo is correctly) given as thirty-three lir of thirty years.-- Verges 2-4 of our inscription occur, in addition to othors, in the inscription mentioned a Verse 2 is also found 10 °54th-Ind.

Wue surnamod Ohhalamattigandal (vv. 18 and 19). This genealogy agrees with that derived from other Kakatiya inscriptions, but acquaints us with the name of Béta's father, which was hitherto unknown. 
Verses 13-27 refer to Jâya (v. 20) or Jâyana (v. 13), a chief whose genealogy is given in dotail in the Ganapêśvaram inscription of Saka-Samvat 1153.3 He was the chief of the elephant-troop of king Ganapati (v. 13) and received from his sovereign, in Saka-Samvat 1135, the city of Shanmukha (v. 20), or Tâmrapuri (v. 19), or Tâmranagari (v. 27). The two last numes are Sanskrit equivalents of the Telugu word Chembrölu (1. 120), the modern Chobrôlı. The same town is designated the city of Shanmukha' on account of its temple of Kumarasvâmin (v. 22 and 1. 114), which is now called Någelvaru. Jâya is stated to have built a wall round Chåbrölu (v. 27) and to have repaired its temples (vv. 21-26). 
The Telugu portion consists of a list of the villages and shares which were the property of the temples at Chébrólu, and of the persons who had granted lamps to these temples. This list was evidently compiled from the records of the temples at the order of Jâya, after he had rocuivod Chebróla in gift from king Ganapati. The majority of the villages and shares annarontly bolonged to the temple of Kumárasvâmin (11. 110 and 114). The temples of Chodabhimêgvard and Vasudeva (1. 119 f.) cannot now be identified at Chebrôlu. The torpio of Ananta-Jina (1. 121) may have been located on the site of a Siva temple, in the court-yard of which Mr. Krishna Sastri found three beautifully carved Jaing figures. TTO further temples at Chêbrôlu, Mülasthậna and Kaduvitteśvara, &re mentioned in verse 26. 
Of tho villages which are referred to in the Telugu portion I can identify only three, vis. Kolluru (1. 114f.) in the Repalle tâluka; Kolankalûru (1. 116), now Kolakalûru, in the samo tüluka ; aul Vallûru (1. 117), 9 nuiles south-west of Chébrólu in the Bapatla tâluke. 
As stated before, king Ganapati granted Chébrôlu to Tâya in the mouth of Chaitra of Baka-Samvat 1185, the cyclic year Srimukha (V, 20), 1.0, A.D. 1213-14, This is the earliest anthonticated date of Ganapati's reign. The inscription itself may have been incised some years lator ; for Jiya must have required several years for accomplishing the buildings which aro roferrod to in the inscription,

Ikshyaku, who was followed by Sagara, Kakutstha, Dilipa, Dasaratha, and Ramachandra (7.7). In the family of these Raghus was born Durjaya, and from him Beta, after him ruled Prôle, whose son was Rudra (v. 8). He was succeeded by his uterine brother Mahadova (.91. His son was Ganapati (v. 10). The Madra king, the Påñobála, the Vidoke king, the Hammira, the Hûna, and the king of Kasi are stated to have been waiting at his door (v. 12). 
(V. 13.) * Verily, prosperous is Jâyana, the chief of the elephant-troop of that lord of the earth (viz. Ganapati), the leader of all actors and Vedic scholars, (and) the crest.jewel of the assembly of poets." ' 
He was the favourite servant of king Chhalamattiganda (viz. Ganapati) (5. 18). 
(V. 19.) - Now onco, returning from the conquest of the kings of the Sonthern region, the heroic Chhalamattiganda came on the way to Tamrapuri, (a city) with flattering banners." 
(V. 20.) "In the Saka year eleven hun dred and thirty-ive, in the month Madhu (i.e. Chaitra), in the (cyclic) year Srimukha, that king gave (Tamrapuri) to the glorious general Jaya, saying: 'By my order rule thou from to-day this city of Shanmukha (Kumara grâmin), which has been protected before by the arm of the maternal uncle of thy mother.2?" 
Ee (viz. Jaya) repaired and whitewashed all the temples (pråsáda) in that city and placed golden pinnacles (lalasa) on them (v. 21). He covered with gold the image of Târakârâti (Komârasvåmin) (v. 22) and supplied vessels of gold, silver, copper and brass for the worship of this god (v. 23). He gave another image of the same god and images of his two consorts, which were made of base metal (löha) and were meant to be carried about in procession at festivals (maha), and built an enclosure, a mandapa of Sani (Saturn), and a gốpura of three storeys (v. 24). 
(V. 25.) “ Then he made for this (god) e mandapa for resting after the sport of the great hant'* on the day of every Makara-Samkrante. On the painting in this (mandapa), tho gods, assembled for the occasion, regard with a thrill the representations of fierce battles between the gods and the demons." 
(V.26.) " He set up again the linga of the Malasthana (temple) avd (the lingo called) Kaduvitteśvara, which had both been destroyed by robbers." 
He sarroanded Tamranagari with a wall surmounted by towers (v. 27).

POSTSCRIPT. Another inscription of Taya and of his sovereign Ganapati (NO. 250 of 1897) is engraved on three sides of a pillar which is now built into the roof of the Liögödbhayasjamin temple at Teandavālu, the capital of the chiefs of Velanandu. The second face of the pillar is turned towards the roof and is henca invisible. The first face opens with the samo passaga as the Chåbrðin inscription pablished above, and breaks off with the words fortfa : GT of verse 10. The third face bears five Sanskrit verges, the first of which is incomplete at the beginping, and a passage in Telugu prose. I subjoin the text of the first sixteen lines of the

No. 18.SRAVANA-BELGOLA EPITAPH OF MARASEMAA II. 
BY J. F. FLker, Po.D., C.I.E. This inscription, ongraved on the four faces of the base of a pillar, which is KDORI LA the Kage-Brahmaddva-kanbha, at the entrance to the gres occupied by the temples of the Obendragiri hill at Sravana-Belgola, wais first brought to notice ayd editar by Mr. Rice, in bin Inscriptions at Sravana-Belgola, No. 38 (sees, also, id. Introd. p. 18 f.). I edit my reusion of it from ink-impressions sapplied to me by Dr. Eultzsch, 
The writing consists of one hundred and fourteen lineg: twenty-seven on the mouth face 
covering an area about 1'97 broad by 2' 10' high; twenty-eight on tho north face, corering at area about 1' 10% broad by % 10" high; and thirty-one on the east face, covering au 1** about 1' 10" broad by 3' 1" high, Irinos 28 to 49 on the west face, and the whole of the writing on the vorth face, gre very much damaged; so much so that no connected PABAYA, worth reproduction, cun be made out. The rest of the record, however, is in a state of gound preservation. The charaoters are Kanarase, of the regular type of the period to which they record refers; and they were boldly formed and well executed throngboat Thay sbew, of course, only the lator or oursive forms of the kh (in Minyakháta, lines 12, 100) and 6 (o.g. bala, line 12, alumbani, line 84). They do not appear to include the separate distinct form of the lingual 4. They show the virima, represented by its own proper sign, in bhxmujan and balut, line 2, kob, line 112, and ir, line 113; and they do not inolude any foal forms. In lipes 1 W 109, the average size of the letters is about " or ". In linos 110 to 114, the characten art Bomewhat smaller and thinner, though of the same type, and possibly written opt by the same hand, with the rest of the record : this may be due to the person who wrote out the rooord, for the edgravar, having not enough space to 'fnish it in completely uniform charactors; or the

passage may be, as suggested by Mr. Rice, & slightly later addition. The language is Sansk in lines 1 to 83, and Kanarese, of the archaic or stilted type, in lines 84 to the end. There a verges in linos 1 to 4,28 to 99, and 112 to 114 ; and I am indebted to Mr. H. Krishna Sas for several very useful suggestions in dealing with both the text and the translation of sol difficult passages in the Kadarese Verses. The Sanskrit gadya or ornate prose, in li 5 to 27, is not very successful, there not being enough of the usual alliteration and rhymi endings; and there is nothing remarkable in such of the Sanskrit verses as remain in lines 50 58: in the Kandreae portion, however, the author, who was evidently an accomplished writer that language, has done full justice to his topic and to himself, both in sonoros diction and sense. The orthography does not present anything calling for special notice. 
The inscription is & panegyric of the Western Gange prince Mârasimha II. It ment him by his proper name in line 42, and throughout the rest of the record by various birudas epitheto, of which the most frequent and evidently the most highly prized one is Nolambal Åntaka, * the Death of the family of the Noļambas, " — with reference to his successes aga the Pallapas of the Nolambavlời thirty-two-thonsand province. Lines 110 to 114, at any : were written after his death; and they tell us that, a year after his completion of the care conquest which is the subject of the earlier part of the record, he abdicated, and died in practice of religion, at the feet of a Jain teacher named Ajitasêna, at Bankápur in Dhûrwir districtstarving himself to death, like so many others whoge epitaphs si Sravana-Belgola, by a three-days fast.? And it seems plain, in fact, that, like various othe the records at Srayana-Belgola, the whole of this inscription is an epitaph, not a contempo oas record engraved while he was still alive. The record is not dated; but it may be o in A.D. 975, as an inscription at Melayani shows that Marasimha II. either died or abdi in or shortly before Jane-Jaly, A.D. 974.

I have given, elsewhere, a full expose of the spurious nature of certain copper-plateg which purport to present an unbroken genealogical list of the Western Gangas going is the second century A.D. And I have shewn how atterly unreliable, for purposes of a history, are those grants and a Tamil chronicle, called Kongudóla-Rajákkal, which parpe furnish information of the same kind. The results of the inquiry on that occasion were the earliest authentio Western Ganga names are those of Sriparusha-Muttarasa, who, de more precise discoveries, was to be placed somewhere in the period A.D. 750 to 850. Sivanira, who was to be placed either immediately before or immediately after Suint Muttarasa ; and that the alleged genealogy was invented in the ninth or tenth century when all the great families of Southern India were beginning to look up their an belongings and deviše more or less fabulous pedigrees. Since the time when I wrote, so records on stone have been brought to notice, and a critical version has been publishe copper-plate grant which was already known but was not satisfactorily available for use these new materials, militating in no way with the conclusions at which I arrived, ena now to put together & genealogical and successional list of the Western Gangas of T (see page 153), and to make a first serious attempt to determine the real history and logy of the family.

proves that at any rate they cannot have been engraved much, if at all, after A.D. 850; while the general palæographic standard of the Talakid inscription points distinctly to a tine somewhat earlier than A.D. 800, as the date of the preparation of that record. It is, thus, not impossible that the person or persons who fabricated the spurious Hosûr and Nagamangala grants, had available, or hit off, true dates for bím, in A.D. 762 and 776-77, or at any rate in the latter year. But it is not possible that, in A.D. 776-77, he had already been ruling for fifty years, as is claimed by the Nagamangala grant; for, the synchronisms which are established for some of his descendants, in both lines, shew plainly that the long life and rule, which he undoubtedly enjoyed, were made out by continuing into the ninth century A.D. The approximate limits for him will be indicated below. 
There are other records of Sripurusha-Muttarasa in Mysore, at 'Devalapura, Varana, Půrigáli, Hemmige, Banpûr, and Holalavadi. The first four of them belong to the earlier part of his career: for, the Půrigâli record styles him "the Maharaja Sriptrusha," as also apparently, does the Déralápura stone; the Varuņa record calls him "the Kongani Mahárdia Sripurusha ;" the Hemmige record describes him as “Prithivi- Kongani-Muttarrsa," without any title ; and the Bannûr record probably styles him “ Pșitho[vi-Konguņi-Muttarasa-Srpurusha," again without any title. All of the records which contain such a reference at all, use the same technical expression of high position and authority which is used in the case of Sivamara I: And the Holalavadi inscription marks az epoch in his careor, by also giving him the para. mount titles; it styles him " the Kongani Mahárájádlıirdja and Paranálvara Sriparasha." 
As far, therefore, as individual names go, the authentic history of the Western Ganga: of Talakad starts with these two persons, Sivamâra I. and his son Sripurusha Mutfarasa. Records giving names for earlier times may, of course, be obtained hereafter ; for

I do not find a 8 of either form in the Siva record. And none of the four records appears to incinde a ich. Mosttention has been drawn to the fact that cursise kh appears, in the lithograph, at the end of line 12 of the Harihar grant of Vinnyaditya of A.D. 6 (Ind. Ant. Vol. TII. p. 300). A inspection, however, of the photograph, which is given with the lithograph P.S. and 0.-C. Insors. No. 17, will shevy that this is only due to w injudicions touching up by hand of damaged 'squara kh; this was done at a time when it was thought more important to publish clear and easily logi lithographs, than to produce absolutely nechanical and faithful facsimiles which an unpractised eye might fine difficult to deal with.

that the Western Gangas were a people of importance and power at least a couple of certaries before the time of Sivamira I., is shewn by the fact that the Kadamba king Mrigéśavarman claims to have defeated them. But it is not at all probable that they will give a connected genealogy: the plainly imaginary nature of some of the names which the spurious granta placo before that of Sivamära I., is a strong indication that materials for compiling a genuire earlier pedigree were not available even then ; and the most that we may expect, is, a few detached notices. All that we know as yet about the Gargas during the centuries immediately following the time when Mţigêśavarman was in conflict with them, is, that they were conquered by the Western Chalukya king Kirtivarman I. in the period A.D. 567-68 to 597-98, and again by his son Pulikesin II. about A.D. 608,4 and that the Harihar grant of Pulikësin's grandson Vinayaditya dated in A.D. 694, speaks of them as hereditary servants of the Western Chalukya kings, And it is plain that they first came prominently to the front on the downfall of the Western Chalukya dynasty. Even then, they did not immediately assert the independence which, undoubtedly, they subsequently enjoyed for a while. That they felt their way gradually to the latter step, is shewn by the facts that Sivamâra I., while adopting a technical expression indi. cative of considerable power, used simply the title of arasa, " king," and that Muttarasil, though meking an advance on this, did not at first assume any higher desigpation than that of Mahårüja, and developed into a Mahártjádhiraja and Parumêsvara, as which he figures in the Holalavadi record, only at some later time. Now, the last Western Chalukya king. Kirtivarman II., lost the northern and central portions of his dominions to the Rashtrakūtas, ander Dantidurga, before A.1). 754. He was still in possession of the southern territory up to A.D. 757. But shortly after that time he was completely overthrown by Dantidurga's successor, Krishna I., -- say, about A.D. 760. And the same period saw the extinctici of another great dynasty of Southern India -- that of the original Pallavas of Conjeeveram, who also, through the possessious that they held in the Nolambavadi province, must have had much to do, though not so directly as the Western Chalakyas, with the Gangas of Talakaļ. The last great Pallava king known to us.--- and, unquestionably, the last repre sentative of his line, was Pallavamalla-Nandivarman, Nandipòtaparman, or Nandipótarkja, son of Hiranyavarman. He was a contemporary of the Western Chalukya king Vikramaditya II., at some time in the period A.D. 733-34 to 746-47. And we have records dated in his twenty-first, twenty-second, and fiftieth years? Now, he succeeded to the Pallava throne after & distant kinsman, Paramêśvaravarman II.;& the latter was preceded by his father, Narasińhavarman II.; and Narasimhavarman was preceded by his father, Paramêśvara varmor I., who was contemporaneons at some time in the period A.D. 655 to 680 with Vikra måditya I., 
And the person whom Mr. Rics thus misplaces -- through a mistake which is to be attributed to the imperfect original rendering of the Udayêndiram grant of Hastimallii-Prithivipati II in Mr. Foulkes' Manual of the Salem Distriot, Vol. II. p. 369 ff., - is Mirasimha I., grandson of the secoud Sivamâra (see page 162 below). 
? Irud. Ant. Vol. VI. p. 25; for " the family of Tungaganga," read " the lofty family of the Gangaa." 
* Thig nach, at any rate, is certain,-- as I have already snid (above, Vol. III. p. 175),- that nothing will Gyer be obtained to authenticate such dates as those of A,D, 248 and 466 which two of the spurioue grants purport to give for Harivarman and Avinita-Konguni, unless it upseta iu some way or other the genealogy that is asserted by the grants; and, on the other hand, if the genealogy Baserted by the grants (or anything like a real basis from #bioh it can have been concocted) is ever authenticated, then the dates will be upset, in favour of much later ones. The genealogy and the dates cannot pogaibly stand together. It is vot li koly, however, that there is any real basis of ancient fact for either the asserted genealogy or these two dates; see the Postacrint, page 174 bolow.

the great-grandfather of Vikramaditya II. In ench circumstances, it is not at all probable that Pallsyawalla-Nandiyarman can have completed the fiftieth year or his reign between A.D. 733 and 747, It is much more likely that his reign did not even commence till A.D. 715 or later. And fifty years from that point would bring him on to just the time to which we mer rafer Sivamâra I, and Mattaruse. The spuriods Manne grant, indeed, would carry him on to even later times: it says, speaking of Sivamára II., that his forehead was adorned by a fillet (of royalty) placed there with their own hands, when they performed (hie's) anointment to the sovereignty, by the two orpgments of the Rashtraküçu and Pallava lineages named Gôyindaraja and Nandivarman, who were (already) anointed on their own) forebeads." I Govindaraja seems to be the Rishtcakuta king Gôyinda III., whose reign began about A.D. 783-84 and ended in A.D. 814-15: Sivamára II. was undoubtedly contemporaneous with him towards the end of his reigu; and we shall find reasone, further on, for believing that he did assist or recognise the succession of Sitamára II. to the leadership of the Gangas. Nandia Varmen must be Pallavamalla-Nandiparraan, son of Hiranyavarman. He wannot have had anything to do with Sivanâra II. at so late a time as the date of his succession on the death o Muttarasa. And it seems that, mixed up with a real act of Górínda III. towards the second Sivamára, the Manne grant has preserved an anachronistic reminiscence of a zoal acto Pallavamalla-Nandiyarman towards the first Sivamâras; vis, that, on the downfall of the Western Chalukyas, ho formally recognised Sivamira I. and crowned bin as the chief, more o less feudatory, of a powerful tribe on the borders of his own outlying province of Nolambavad The date of A.D. 760, mentioned above as the closely approximate time of the complete extinctio of the Western Chalukya power, is within the period to which Śivamâru I. is to be referred, 2.7 within the time to which the reign of Pallavamalla-Nandiyarman may be carried on. And sball probably be very near the truth, if we take A.D. 756 as the initial date of the successio of Sivamára I. to the leadership of the Western Gangas, and A.D. 760 as the time whe he was recognised by Pallavamalla-Nandiyarman. We may theo place the accession Muttarasa abogt five years later, in A.D. 785; and, as there are indications, as alreac mentioned, that he had a long rule, and es we have a record which is actually dated perhaps his twenty-ninth year, we may assume that he ruled for about forty years, 1 to A.D. 806. As the record which seems to be dated in his twonty-ninth year still gix him, like the earlier ones, the title of Mahardja, it would appear that it was in the last t years of his time that he threw off all semblage of vassalage and assumed the paramou titles; till then, he must have been more or less feudatory, at first to Pallavamal Nandivarman, and then to a kingman of his own, Vijaya-Narasiühavarman, who, as shall see just below, succeeded to the Pallava throne after Pallavamalla-Napdivarman.

We shall revert presently to the descendants of Sripurusha-Muttarasa, wieanwhile, w conveniently notice here another branch of the Western Ganga family, which succeeded to the Pallava dominions, 
Two tirpals or monumental tablets at Amber in the North Arcot district, minh commemorate the death in battle of two heroes, followers of a certain Pirndi-Givik, , on an occasion when the army of the Nulamba, i.e. the Pallava prince of Shiva attacked the village for a cattle-raid - cite the twenty-sixth year of a king a vidi Vijaya Nripatunga-Vikramavarman. There are other inscriptions of the same king in tlie Tuning and Trichinopoly districts. And on palæographic grounds, as well as for reasons conncited with the history of that part of the country, it is necessary, Dr. Hultzsch tells as, tai the reign of this Vijaya-Nripatunga-Vikramavarman before that of the Chola king Piriutusal. (about A..D, 900 to 940). There are also two copper-plate grants of the sane king, one of which, obtained at Bahtir near Pondicherry, and dated in his eighth year, 13.nex his immediate ancestors and gives the pedigree that he claimed. That pedigreo is, first, the Puranic genealogy of the Pallayas, from the god Brahman to the eponymous Pallaya, the alleged founder of the family. From his family, the grant says, there were born Viwhite * Kvikanika," and "other kings." When they had passed away, a certain Dantivarman beciune king. His gon was Nandivarman, whose wife was Sankha, of the Rashtrakúta family. And their son was Nripatungadhva, or Vijaya-Nřipatungavarman as he is called in the Tamil portion of the grant,mj.e. the Vijaya-Nripatunga-Vikramavarman of the stono rocords at Åmbůr and elsewhere. Now, the seal of the other grant of Vijanie Nripatunga-Vikramvarman bears the bull-crest of the Pallayas,-- in due accordance rithe the descunt that is put forward for him. But we may safely adopt Dr. Anltzsch's suggestions, that the name of "Konkanika" is a reminiscence of the "Konkani" who is represented as the original ancestor of the Western Gaugas in the Udayêndiram grant of Hastimalla-Prithivipati IL.,* and why is, of course, the mythical Konguņivarman whom the spurious grants from Mysore claim as the founder of the Western Ganga family; and that consequently, in spite of the Pallava pedigree, & connection with the Western Gangas was claimed by Vijaya-Nripatunga-Vikraimuvarman. And we may also safely follow Dr. Hultzsch in his identification of Dantivarman with the Dantiga, king of Kärchi, whom the Rashtrakůta king Govinda III. subdued and levied tribute from in A.D. 804, and in his inference that the Rashtrakůta princess Sankhî, wife of Nandivarman, was a daughter of Govinda's son and successor Nriputaaga-Amôg havarsha I. (A.D. 814-15 to 877-78), after whom her sun must have beon partly named. 
There are also, we aro told by Dr. Haltzsch, various stone records, not yet published, which may be attributed with some probability to Dentivarman and Nandivarnan: there ia a rocord of Dantivarman in the Vaikuntha-Perumal temple at Conjeeveram; and thero are inscriptions at the Viriñchipuram temple in the North Arcot district, uod at Sadupperi, near Vålûr in the same district, dated in the ninth, forty-seventh, and fifty-second years of Vijaya-Nandi-Vikramavarman who may be identified with Nandivarman, son of

Gangas to assume the designation of Porwanadi, and that he took it from a Pallava king of Kanchi, on defeating him. We have already been that it was Muttarant who first assumed the paramount titles. And so. though his records have not yet disclosed the use of the designation Permanadi by him, the Himcha record very possibly preservas, in the above 43sertion, a real historioal item, mixed up in the dual mythical matter in which it follows more or less the sparious grants. The said king of Kdichi, defeated by him, would bo hie kineman Vijaya-Narasimhavarman,- defeated when he throw off the yoke of vassalage.

Dantiyarman, And at Ukkal in the North Arcot district there are inscriptions? giving the name of a Kampavarman, or more fully Vijaya-Kampa-Vikramavarman, who may have belonged to the same family with Vijaya-Nțipatunga-Vikramavarman and his ancestors. 
But, of more importance for present purposes, is the fact that, at Kil-Muttagûr in the North Arcot district, there is an inscription dated in the eighteenth year of a king Vijaya Narasimhavarman, which shows, in the sculptures below it, the Western Ganga emblems of the elephant and the goose or swan -- the emblems being connected with Vijaya-Narasimhavarman himself by the fact that he was, evidently, the maker of the grant that is registered in the record. The name of this person is, characteristically, a Pallava name: but the emblemg mark him as a Western Ganga; and he has been appropriately described by Dr. Hultzsch as "a Pallava by name, but Western Ganga by descent." Now, the alphabet of this record at Kil-Muttugûr is more archaic than that of the Âmbûr inscriptions; and Vijaya-Narasimhavarman must, therefore, be placed at any rate before Vijaya-Nripatnnga-Vikramavarman. That he was connected with Vijaya-Nțipatunga-Vikramavarman, and also with Vijaya-Kampa-Vikrama varman, is plainly indicated by the use of the prefix kô, “ king," in all three cases, and of the word vijaya, in the Tarail form visaiya, as part of the proper names: and it appears that one of the grants of Vijaya-Nřipatunga-Vikramayarnas actually places a Narasimha in the genealogy, before Dantivarman. Whether Kampavarman came before Narasimhayarman, or after him, is not yet known. But the retention of the Western Ganga enblems by Narasimhavarman refers him to & period when the members of this branch of the Ganga family had vot fully turned themselves into Pallaras. And it seems probable that he was the one who secured the succes sion to the Pallava dominions, If so, as he must have done it on the death of Pallavamalla Nandirarman, son of Biraṇyavarman, we may place his initial date somewhere about A.D. 760 to 770. He was eventuelly followed by Dantivarman, Nandivarman or Vijaya Nandi-Vikramayarman, and Vijaya-Npipatunga-Vikramavarman, And one or other of them, or perhaps Vijaya-Kampa-Viktimavarman, discarded the emblems of the Western Gangas and adopted those of the Pallayas, thus converting himself into a Pallara, just as the Eastern Chalukyas became Cholas in the time of Kulottunga-Choladdva 1.5 The exact connection of Vijaya-Narasimhavarman with Siyamára I. remains to be discovered. 
We revert now to the descendants of Sripurusha-Muttaraga. The spurious Sadi grant gives the name of Siyamára II., as his eldest son; and the spurious grants from Sura dhënupura and Manno purport to be records of this person himself.? Now, one of the

Siyarpaths inscriptions makes mention of a Sivamara who was governing the village of Kadabûr or Kadabûr, - which may be identified either with the modern Kadaburu' in the Gundlupet tåluka of the Mysore district, or with Kadaba in the Gubbi taluks of the Tumkur district in the time of Sripurusha-Muttaraba, and in, perhaps, his twenty ninth year. There is nothing in this record to establish any relationship between this Sivamära and Muttarasa. But we may take it as tolerably certain that he was a son of Sripurusha-Mattarasa, as stated in the sparious grants, and that we have here another authentic name, that of sivamâra II. We have already noticed the fact that the spurious Manne grant speaks of a fillet of sovereignty being placed on his head by the Råshtrakůta king Gôyinda III. (from about A.D. 783-84 to A.D. 814-15). Spurious as the record is, there is nothing impossible in the truth of the statement; especially if it is taken in connection with certain statements in the records of Gôyinda III. himself, which tell us that he released from long captivity, and sent back to his own country, one of the Gangas, who had been imprisoned by his father®DhruvaThe Rashtrakūta records, indeed, do not disclose the name of the Ganga who was thus treated. But the clue to his identity is fornished by the spurious Manne grant, which asserts that Siyamira II, made himself famous by being victorions against the armies of the Rashtrakūtas, the Chalukyas,* and the Haihayas (1.e. the Kalachuris), when they were encamped at a village named Mudukundûr, and that he defeated the countless cavalry of Dhruva which had overrun the whole earth. Sivamira II. may very well have been entrusted with the command in some war between his father and Dhritu. And we may suppose that, during the campaign, he was eventually defeated, captured, and imprisoned by Dhruva, and that, on Muttarasa's death, he was liberated by Govinda III., in order to succeed to the leadership of the Gangas, on which occasion the Rashtrakůța king would very likely crown him--- as the spurious Manne grant asserts -- with some feudatory crown. This event may be placed somewhere about A.D. 805. The same passages in the Rashtra kata records tell us that, after no long time, Govinda III. found it necessary to re-conquer the Ganga, who through excess of pride stood in opposition to him, and to put him in fetters

A copper-plate grant from Udayêndiram in the North Arcot district? carries this line of descent three generations further: it mentions, in the lineage of "Konkani, the first of the whole Ganga race, in which lineage, it says, following the sparious grants, there had been born Vishņugôpa, Hari (i.e. Harivarman), Madhava, Durvinita, Bhůvikrama, and “other kings," -Sivamára II.; his son Pțithivipati I., otherwise called Aparajita ; Mârasimba I., "the light of the Ganga family," son of Prithivipati I.; and Marasimhe's son, Prithivipati II., otherwise called Hastimalla, “a flamingo in the tank of the Ganga family. In the tray of historical information, it tells us that Prithivipati I. saved Iriga and Nagadanta, sons of king Dindi,- one of them from Amôghavarsha, i.e. the Rashtrakůta king Amoghavarsha I. (A.D. 814-15 to 877-78), and the other from the jaws of death; that he fought & battle at & place named Vaimbalguli; and that he defeated the Pandya prince Varaguņa in the great battle of Sripurambiya ;5 and that Prithivspati II, received from Madiraikonda-Parakesariyarma-Parantaka, i.e. the Chðļa king Parantaka I. (about A.D. 900 to 940), " the dignity of lord of the Bâņas," ~ 2.e. that Parântaka I. conferred on him the leadership of the Båna kingdom, which is defined elsewhere as " the land to the rest of the Andhra country.'? And it registers the fact that, at the request of Prithivipati II., Parântaka I., in the fifteenth year of his reign,---1.. in or about A.D. 915.-- converted the village of Kadaikköttür, together with Udayasandiramangalam (Udayêndiram itself), into a bralmadêya, or grant to Brâhmans, which was then called Viranarayanachcheri after one of his own appellations. The record says that, from the time when the Bags kingdom was conferred on Prithivipati II., it was thought that he was born of the race of Bali, he. of the Bâņa race; and the Tamil portion of it aatually calls him Sembiyan-Mivali-Vaqarüya, meaning apparently, " (he who was appointed ) Mahabali. Bânarája (by) the Chola king." And it further discloses the fact that, while retaining the Western Ganga title of " lord of Nandi (ie. Nandagiri)," he took the title of " lord of tho city of Parivipuri," and assumed the banner of a black-buck and the crest of a bull. It is thus evident that, like his connections who became Pallavas, Prithivipati II. turned himself regularly into a Bâna. 
Somewhere about the end of the time of Sivaméra II. there was -- if the Kadaba grant (abore, Vol. IV. p. 832) might be relied on, --& certain Châkirkja, who is described in that record as "king of the whole of the Gaúga province," in A.D. 813.

In the other line of descent from Śrīpurusha-Muttarasa, the Vallimalai inscription has given us the names of his son Raņavikrama, and Ranavikrama's son Rajamalla. The latter is evidently the Dharma-11ahardjûdhirdjaSatyavákya-Konguņivarma-Permanadi. Rajamalla, " lord of Kovalála, the best of towns," and "lord of the mountain Nandagiri," who is mentioned as the ruling prince in an inscription at Flusukūru, in Mysore, dated Saka-Savat 792 (expired),= A.D. 870-71. This must be taken as his final date. An earlier record, at Doddahuņdi in Mysore, mentions him as simply Satyavikya-Permanadi, and his father Raņavikrama as the Dharma-Maharajadhiraja Nitimârga-Konguņivarma Permanadi,“ lord of Kovalâla, the best of towns,"5 and “lord of the mountain Nandagiri ;'' this record was written on the death of the father; it tells as that Nitimârga died, and that there survived, to (render service to) his son Satyavâ kya, a domestic official named Agarayya, who is apparently describod in the text, and represented in the sculptures above it, as tending Nitimârga in his dying moments.c 
The Husukůru inscription of A.D. 870-71, quoted above, pientions also a certain Bútarasa, who then, in the time of Rajamalla, was governing the Kougalnid and Pånad districts, as Yuvarúja. With this person, whom we may conveniently enter in the table as Bûtugs I., and who, as the Yuvardja or chosen guccessor, was in all probability the actual successor, 
? The sparious Sudi grant (see page 167 below, pole 2 ) gives Rajamalla's name, and two of his secondary appellations, correctly-Satyarakya-Konguụivarna-Rajamalla. But it calls his father Vijayaditya ; se, also, do some other records of the same class.-- It is not unlikely that the 1&10e of Vijayaditya vas borrowed, by a particularly gross unistake, from the Eastern Chalukya dyansty, two mombers of which had hostile rolations with the Gangas : for one of them, Narendramţigurája-Vijayaditya II., see page 161 above, note 4 ; the other is his. grandson, Gunaka-Vijayaditya III., who, we are told, being prompted by the Rashtra kuța king, conquered the Ganges, at sove time in the period A.D. 844 to 888 (see Ind. Ant. Vol. XX. p, 102, and above, Vol. IV. p. 226); in this passage again, there is unfortunately no mentiou of the name of any individual Ganga. 
This titlo menos literally "a Maharajadhirdja by or in respect of religion," or by free translation " a pious or righteous Mandrajddhiraja." It occurs, in earlier times, unquestionably as a title of paramount sovereiguty, in the case of the Pallava king Siva-Skandayarwan. In the Western Ganga records, however, it is an amplification which attracts attention, of the plain title Mahdrájdahardja which, coupled with Paramtávara, is given in the Holalavadi inscription (deo page 156 above) to Muttartsa, who, in one period of his career, was undoubtedly as Paramount king. And the recurrence, in the subsequent Western Ganga records, of the same amplified form without any other paramount title, suggests that it was used by the Western Gangas more 4s & hereditary and honorific designation than with the intention of implying any claim to paramount sovereignty. Like the great feudatory nobles of other families, the Western Gargas were donbtless semi-independent in their hereditary province; but in all other respects they seein distinctly to have acknowledged the supremacy of the Rashtrakůța kiuga.

foul, shameless, obscene language; obscenity,' but to which Reeve and Sanderson's Kabarese Diotionary would give tho meaninge of exaggeration fear, apprehension.

of Rajamalla,..- We may venture to identify the Dharma-Mahlrájidhiraja Satyavákya. Kongunivarme-Permanađi of an inscription at Billiûr, in Coorg, which cites a date in the mouth Phálguna (Feb.-March), Saka-Samvat 809 (expired), falling in A.D. 888, as being in his eighteenth year, and thus fixes the commencement of his rule in A..D. 870 or 872. And, as we know that not long after this date there was a ruler of the Gangavidi province named Dreyappa, whose son Râchamalla was killed by Bütuga in or before A.D. 940, to Bûtnga I. we may also ascribe an inscription at Iggali, in Mysore, & which, again, mentions the mlino prince as the Dharna-Mahúrájádhiraja Satyavákya-Kongurivarma-Permanadi, and more tions Ereyappa also, and further speaks of a certain Râcheya-Ganga, who, it tells ng, died fighting against the Nolamba, i.e. the Pallava prince of the Nolambavadi province, in the twentre second year, i.e. in A.D. 891-92.* 
Bütuga I. must have been succeeded by Ereyapp. We have a record of this prince, mentioning him by the name of Ereyappa, in the Bêgür inscription, which describes him as a spotless moon in the sky that was the family of the Gangas, and says that, having deprired all his enemies of power, he was governing the Gangavadi ninety-six-thousand as an united whole and which further mentions a war between the army of the Nâgattara and a certain Vira. llabendra? who was probably one of the Palla vas of Nolambavadi, and an attack upon a person named Ayyapadeva. And, from the way in which the date fits in, we may asaribe to 
? The spurious Süời grant (see page 167 below, note 2) would make him & grandson of Rajamalla, giving the intermediate names of Nitimårga-Konguņivarmg-Ereganga, con of Rajamalla, and of a second Satyaväksi. Kongurivarma-Rajamalla, son of Breganga and elder brother of Butuga (Bútarasa). As Yuvardia, he may of course, have been the grandson, quite as well as the son, brother, or nephew, of Rajaunalla. But I cannot 
find anything to suthenticate any of the alleged intervening names

I am dealing with only the really important and useful recorde--- mostly those which can be used to determine the sucoession or may be referred to specific individuals, through their giving personal names or dates, or vbieh otherwise present points of leading interest. In Ep, Carn. Vol. III., & record at Kyåtanhalli (Sr. 147, with a lithograph) mentions Satyavákya Kongonivarme-Permanadi and Ereyappa, and another at Müdahalli (Nj, 130) mentions Permadi, Mahadhvi, and Ereyappa; inscriptions of a Satyavškya at Rampura (Sr. 148, with a litho. crapb), at Kappusdge (Nj. 68), at Gattavå di (Nj, 97), and at Nagarle (Nj, 155), may be records of Satyavakya Batuga I. (or of some other Satyavákya), and so also may another inscription at Kotur, in Coorg (Ind. Aut. Vol. VI. p. 103, No. III ; Coorg Inscriptions, p. 6); and an inscription at Pattasômahalli (Sr. 134) may be referred either to Bataga I, or to Exeyappa. But these records teach 18 nothing, and cannot be placed with any certainty until we obtain other records, assiguable without any doubt, mentioning the priests, eto., whose names 
occur in them. 
5 Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p. 346 ; for a lithograph, see the frontispiece of Mr. Rice's Mysore Insoriptions. 
& The expression in the original is da-chchhattra-chohidyeyol, "under the shadow of a single umbrella." Ita purport is explained by such passages Ag that which tells us that Gangardja, the minister of the Hoysala prince Vishnuvardhana, having driven out all the feui&tories of the Chôļa king from the Gangavadi province, "brought ander one umbrella all that (territory) which had become (split up into various separate) districte, "-nad-adud. sllaman=&ka-chomhatran-madi (Ep. Carn. Vol. III. MI, 31, line 34; and compare a similar passage in Inore, at Srao-Bel. No. 90). 
Mr, Rice (Ep. Caru. Vol. III. Introd. pp. 4, 5) seems to identify this person with the Mahendradhiraja of an inscription at Baragür, who was the son of Pallavådhiraja and of Jayabbe, younger sister of a Ganga who had the appellation of Nitimirga, 1.d., apparently, of Breyappa bimself. From a transcription which Mr. Rice has kindly gent me, it appears that the Baragür inscription describes the younger sister of Nitimårgs as also a daughter of Rajamalla. This Nitimérge, therefore, was a son of Rajamalla. 
8 I have said (Ep. Ind. Vol. I, p. 350) that it is possible, but by no means & certainty that this person may be the Western Chalukya Ayyana l., of the time between the period of the Western Chalukyus of Bladmi and the period of the Western Chalukyag of Kalyani. Mr. Rice, however (Bee Ep. Carn. Vol. III. Introd. p.

him an inscription at Külagere, in Mysore, which mentions the ruling prince as the Dharma Maharájádhírája Nitimârga-Konguņivarma-Permanadi, and is dated Saka-Samvat 831 (expired), = A.D. 809-910. The Tggali inscription has given a date for him in A.D. 891-92. That, however, is a date for him in the time of his predecessor. And, from an inscription at Honnayakanbal}i,” it would appear that his rule began in S.-S. 815 (expired), = A.D. 893-94,8 It wonld seem that he did not secure the succession without some opposition. We have, just after the date mentioned above for the commencement of his rule, an inscription at Tâyalúr, in Mysore,' i.e. within the Western Ganga territory, which is dated 6.-S. 817 (expired), = A.D. 895-96, and mentions, as then reigning or ruling, & certain Nolambadhiraja, --- that is to say, the Pallave prince of the Noļambavâți province. The explanation of this is evidently furnished by the statement in the Bêgûr inscription that, when that record was drawn up, Ereyappa was governing, after having deprived all his enemies of their power ; plainly, big accession to the leadership of the Western Gaigas was opposed, and chiefly by the Pallavas of Noļambavadi, who succeeded in occupying for a time part at least of his here ditary possessions. 
From the Atakur inscription, we know that Ereyappa had a son named Râchamalla I., and that it was by fighting and killing Râchamalla that another member of the family, Bûtuga II., obtained the succession. As will be seen further on, this occurred in or before A.D. 840. We have no records attributable to Râchamalla I. But the length of time from the initial 
noto 3), appears to have obtained evidence that Ayyapadóra was a Pallava. The evidence seems to be the Hire Bidanur ingoription (mentioned by Mr. Rico as the Goribidaur inscription in Mys. Inscrs. Introd. p. 45), which, according to a transcription that Mr. Rice has kindly sent me, distinctly mentions Ayyapadêra as Pallao-duvaya and As bøving also the name of Nolambadhiraja, . 
1 Ep.Carn. Vol. IIL, MI. 80.--- 49 I have already intimated (page 152 above), my identifications, apon which This part of the succession is arranged, must be takea as tentative for the present: the miscellaneous subordinate tems of information, contained in the records at present available, do not help at all, and we want more Fregimiles in the case of records which are not dated. But my identifications are at any rate mora satisfactory than those proposed by Mr. Rice. Thus (ibid. Introd. p. 4, and see also his Classified List which follows page 36), be yould identify the Nitimárga of the Kilagere insoription, and Erepappa, with, respectively, the Nitinérga and 
is son Satyavákya (whom I identify with Ragavikrama, the son, and Rajawalla, the graudson, of Mattarasa) of the Doddahundi inscription (page 165 above); whereas, the date of the Külagere inscription, and the period in which we must of necessity placu Eresappa, are altogether inconsistent with the 118e of the old forro of tbe leh in he Doddahnndi insoription, Arid he would further identify with the Nitimdrga of the Külagera inscription the de travakya (whom I identify with Butuga I.) of the Iggali inscription (page 164 above); wherean, it seems clear to ne that a Nitimârga is not to be identified with any Satyavákya. 
? Mentioned by Mr. Rice in En. Carn. Vol. III. Introd. p. 4. I assume that Mr. Rice means that this scord actually contains the appellation of Nitimárga, and that he does nos simply allot it to a Nitimârga namely, to the Nilimarga to whom he would allot also the Doddahuņdi and Kilagere records) on some merely oferontial grounds, 
Here, again, I am dealing with only the really important records. Other records of Erayappa, in By, Carn. Vol. III., are TN. 115, at Bannur, and Nj. 78, at Hosukdra. For others which mention him with 
is predecessor, and for one which may belong to either of them, see page 164 above, note 4. And we may lerhaps allot to him records of a Nitimarga st Kannegåla (TN, 140), and at Gattavadi (Nj. 98). 
Hp, Cori. Vol. III, Md. 18. Mr. Rice (ibid. Introd. p. 4) speaks of it as "apparently an independent want by Nolambadbiraja, * but also suggests that Nolambadhir&ja was " perhaps subordinate to Nitimårga," 
a to Erovappa. I think, however, that the true explanation ie that which I suggest. He also (loc. oit.) ropogen to treat as "ap intrusive Pallapa inscription " Another record at Tiyalur (Md, 14, with & lithograpb). 
high is dated in the month Sravana (Jnly-Aug.), Saka-Sanevat 829 (expired), falling in A.D. 907 : Lere, however, here is nothing to refer the record. to any particular family; it only registers & grant made by villagere, and it 
es pot mention the ruler at all. 
See page 166 £., below. 
The Humcha inscription (see page 158 above, note 4) appears to give bia name in the form of Rajamalla; g, Bigo, probably does the spuriode Sidi grant (page 167 below, note 2). The Sadi grant would give him the appella ion of Nitimárga, end the biruda of Kacbcbeya-Garga," the quarrelsorge or fighting Ganga;” but the Humaha ucription appears to shew Bajamalla and Kachcheya-Geiga 88 separate persons.

date of Ereyappa, A.D. 893-94, to the latest date that we have for Bûtuga II., A.D. 949.50. renders it probable that he did actually sacceed to the leadership of the Gangas, though perhaps for no long period; and the Rashtrakůta record which mentions his overthrow and fixes the latest date for it, seems, in fact, to describe him as actually in possession. 
The next in succession Fas Bütuga II., whose name appears in Kaparese in also the form of Batayya and in Sanskrit as Bhutêrya, and who had the full appellation of the Dharma-Mahürdjadhiraja Satyavákya-Konguņivarma-Permanadi-Bûtuga, and the biruidas of Ganga-Gângéya, "& very Kârttikêya, Karna, or Bhishma, among the Gangas," Ganga-Narayaņa, "a very god Vishņu among the Gangas," Nanniya-Ganga, " the truthful Gaiga," and Jayaduttararga, " the lintel of victory."3 It has already been noted that the Atakûr inscription tells us that he obtained the succession by fighting and killing Richamalla I., Son of Epeyappa; and, that this occurred in or before A.D. 940, is shewn by a Rashtrakata grant from Déðli, dated in that year, which mentions the fact of the overthrowing of Richamalla (therein called Rachhyamalla), and implies that Batuga (therein spoken of ag Bhútarya) received material assistance from the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III.- The Hebbal inscription of A.D. 975, from the Dhúrwår district,s tells us that, during the reign of the Râshtrakūta king Krishna II., Batuga II. married Rêvaka, who was a daughter of Vajdigan (grandson of Kțishna II.) and an elder sister of Krishna III., and that he received, as her dowry, the districts known as the Puligere or Purigere three-hundred, which was the country that lay round, and was named after the ancient name of, Lakshmôshwar, in the Miraj Stata about the centre of the Dharwår district,--the Belvola three-hundred, which lay in the same neighbourhood and included, as various records show, Gadag, Annigere, Kurtaköti, and Nargund, in Dharwår, Hali in the Belgarm district, and Kukkandr in the Nizam's Dominions, — the Kisukad seventy, which was a small district of which the chief town wag Pattadakal, the ancient Kisavolal and Pattada-Kisuvo!al, in the Badîmi taluka. Brúnar district--and the Bage, Bågenåd, or Bigadage, seventy, which dis another small district, lying round Bagalkot, the ancient Bigadage and Bågadige, the chief town of the Bagalkot täluka in the same district. This marriage must be placed somewhere towards the end of the reign of Krishna II. ; say, about A.D.910. The same record mentions also another wife of Båtuga II., named Kallabbaresi, and his mother Bhajjabbarasi, the elder sister of Battayye. Sinhavarmarasa, and Chechchapayya. Of the time of Bûtuga II. himself, we have an inscription at Atakar, in Mysore, dated in the Saumya samuatsara, Saka-Samyat 872 
1 The Gamcha inscription and the spurious Südi grant represent him as a younger brother of Rajamalla, 1.8. R&chamalla I. This statement, however, has not yet been perillod, 
The spurious Sidi grant would give the first component of this appellation in the form of Satyanttiválya; this, however, is an 8uomalous forni, which is not at all likely to be authentic. 
8 These biridas are given in the Atakur inscription. In the last of them, jayad is, by euphonic combination, for jayada, the Kantrese genitive singular of jaya. 
The original says, 'Bocording to Dr. Bhandarkar's translation, that Krishna III. « planted as it were in a garden in the field of the Gangas the holy tree of BhutArya, baviug uprooted the poisonous tree of Rachly.mello! (Jour, Bo. Bgy. . As. Soc. Vol. XVIII. p. 261); 50, also, the Kardd graut of A. D. 959, -he planted in Gangapati, as in a garden, the pure tree Bbütarya, baving aprooted the poisonous tree Bachhyamalla" (above. Vol. IV. p. 289). 
& Above, Vol. IV. p. 350. 
8 Krishna II, succeeded to the throne in or verg soon after A.D. 878; and the latest date thnt we bare for him is A.D. 911-12. According, therefore, to the actual wording of the Hebbdl inscription, the marriage may have taken place at any time between A.D. 878 and 912. But we must place it as Into 48 possible in that period, because Křisbạn IT. w's a great-grandfather at the time of the marriage, and Maruladdva, the son of Båtuga II. and Rèraka, was not bora, - 80 the record tells uw until the reign of Vaddiga, 1.4, between A.D. 983 and 940. 
7 Ep. Ind. Vol. II. p. 168 ; since then, it has been editod by Mr. Rice also (Ep. Carn. Vol. III., Md. 41, with a lithograph), to whose rendering I owe the name of the hound Kali in line 10. Mr. Rice (ibid. Introd, p. 6. And see the Classified List of the Inscriptions) would connect with Buluga certain inscriptions at Varuņa in Myaore (My 35 to 37 and 40 to 40), wbicb appear to mention Chalukya princes named Narasimhn aud Gugga or Goggi,

(current),=A.D. 949-50, which records the facts that Krishna III. tought and killed the Chola king Rajúditya at Takkola ---- the modern Takkolam, on the south-east of Arconun Junction in the North Arcot district, Madras Presidency, and that Batuga II., being pleased with the prowess in battle of his follower Manalarata, of the lineage of Sagara, who had the baruda of Bütugana-ankakâra," the warrior or chanıpion of Bütuga" and the hereditary title of “lord of Valablî, the best of towns," bestowed on him, as a mark of favour, a bound named Kali; that the hound was set at a big boar on a hill in the village of Beļatür in the Kelale district; that the hoand and the boar killed each other; and that, in commemoration, the stone which bears the record, and which has on it a sculpture shewing the fight of the bound and the boar, was set up at Âtakûr, and a small grant of land was made. It is an addition at the top of this record which tells us that Baluga II. had, proviously, obtained the Gangavadi province by fighting and killing Râchamalla I., the son of Ereyappa ; and it adds that it was Bütuga II. who actually slew the Chola king Rájậditya, and that Kșishna III. then gave to Bûtuga II., t.e. confirmed him in the possession of, the four districts mentioned above es forming the dowry of Rêvakay and also gave him the Banavasi twelve-thousand province.? 
The Hebbal inscription tells as that the son of Bütuga II. and Rêvaka was Maruladova; but it does not say that he ruled, and perhaps implies that he did not. To Maruladéra and Bijabbe, it says, there was born a son, whom it perhaps names as Rachcha-Ganga; and he, it says, did rule: we havo, however, as yet, no records attributable to him. 
Next in succession, it tells us, there came another son of Batuga II., by another wife named Kallabbarasi, viz. Marasimha II., who had, as we learn from it and other recorda, the full 
a god named Bûteśvara, which seems to commemorate either Butuga II. or his predecessor Butarasa-Batuga I., 
and a battle between two persons called Badiga and Polukesi, the latter of whom, he suggests, may have been the Western Chalukya king Irivabedavga-Satyasraya, Those period, however (A.D. 997 and 1008), is half & century too late for Båtuga II. Till we have lithographs, it is impossible to make any satisfactory use of these inscriptions. 
1 I owe this identification to Dr. Hultzsch, who tells me that at Takkolam there is, among other records, an inscriptiou of Krishna III. himself.-- Takkolam is a postal town, in the Waldjdpet tåluka, and, as such, is duly mentioned in the Indian Postal Guide, which I hart overloolcod. 
A copper-plate graut from Súdi, in the Dhirwår district (above, Vol. IIl. p. 158, with & partial litho graph), purports to be another record of Bütuga II., and to be dated in the month Kárttika (Oct.-Nov.), falling fu A.D. 938 or 939, of the Vikürin samvatsart, coupled with Saka-Samvat 860 expired, perbaps correctly (accord. ing to the northern luni-solar system of the sixty-year cycle), or perhaps by mistake for 861 expired (according to the southern luni-solar system). It presents a perfectly possible das for Butuga II.; and it quotes his birulas correctly. On the other hand, it includes the fictitious geneulogy, before Sivamdra Li, which is given in the unquestionably spurious records ; ia mentioning a real historiogl fact, vix, the marriage of Bütuga II, with & daughter of Amöghavarsha-Vaddiga, it leaves us to infer that her bame was Divaldunbb, whereas the naine given in the Hebbal inscription is Råvaka; the characters in which it is engraved present a decidedly later general ap pearance than those of the Atakur insaription, and of any records, that I am aoquainted with, belonging to Within fifty years or 80 after the asserted dale; and the details of the date do not work out correctly for either of the two years to which it is possible to rofer them. These points present reasons for viewing the record with erent suspicion. And there is the following additional reason for stamping it conclusively as & spurious record : namely, it mentions the victory over the Clodla king Råjåditya as a fact already accomplished in A.D, 938 or 939; whereas, not only is this event not mentioned in the Dooli grant of A,D, 940, which enumerates the achievements of Krishna III. pretty fully, and would certainly not have omitted such an event as that, if it had occurred, but also the Atakar iascription distinctly places the crent in A.D. 949-50.-- I have said above, Vol. III. p. 176) that the characters of the Sadi grant seem to be distinctly more moderu than thogo of the Korumelli grant of RAirija I. (Ind. Ant. Vol. XIV. p. 48, and lithogr.pl), which was issued in or after A,D. 1022. The Koramelli crant is from the easteru part of Southern India. Among the western records, the characters of the Súdi granti resemble post closely those of the grant of the Sildhåra prince Marasirohn, of A.D. 1058 (Cave-Tompie Inscrip. tions, No. 10 of the brochures of the Archæological Survey of Western India, p. 102, and lithograph). The Sudi orant purports to supply various other items of history in connection with Bütuga II. (amougst them, that after the defeat of Rijaditya, he besieged Taújậpuri, t.e. Tanjore, whicl: was possibly & fact; see above, Vol. III. p. 283), and a fery in connection with some of his predecessors. I do not quote them; because it is undesirable to encumber my pages, further than cannot well be avoided, with alleged nanos and events for which we have no reliable authority.

Ep. Carr, Vol. IIL, Nj, 192.- The day is called Peretale-divasi," the day of Siva ( pere-tale, pere-dalene "he ou whose head is the crescont'): the same day of Srdraņu is mentioned in an inscription of A.D. 907 at Taralir (ibid. Md. 14; noticed on page 165 above, note 4); and the same day of Märgaśirsha, in an inscription at Rampura (ibid. Sr. 148; noticed on page 164 above, note 4). One vould think, at first sight, tunt the expression denotes the day of the fourteenth tithi of the dark fortnight, on which there is the Sivardtri-festival in honour of Siva, in every month, all through the year; in which case, we might compare with it the expression Siva-tithi," the tithi of siva" (in No. 292 of Prof. Kielhoru's Saka diates; Ind. Ant. Vol, XXIV, p. 202), applied in yerde to Maghe trishp& 14, which in another record ( No. 325 in the game list ) has the faller mahitithi, also in varse. But it really denotes the eighth tithi, as rendered by Mr, Rice in his translations: thug a verse in the Chaturvarga-Chintamani, Vol. III. Part II, p. 865, line 9, for which I am indebted to Prot. Kielhorn, gays-saptam! Saptasaptés= Ashtamtrtésztath=&shtami, "the seventh is Surya's tithi, and the eighth that of Siva ;" and it appears to be applied to the eighth tithi of both the bright and the durk fortnights, In a similar way, the sparious Sudi grano (see page 167 above, bota 2) names the eighth tithi of the brisht fortnight of Karttika" the tithi of Nandtsvara," 2.e, of Siva as the lord of the bull Nandi; and the Nandiera day of the bright fortnight of Phalguna, without any specification of the tith, is mentioned in the Peggu-dr iuscrip, tion of A.D. 978 (see poge 173 below). - In this last record, the naine is followed by a word which bas not been satisfactorily settled yet. Mr. Kittel read Nandhivaran lalpanllevasafn=dge, and translated “when the Nandisyana (day) was the chair.day* (Ind. Ant. Vol. VI p. 102); and Mr. Rice has suggested the leading of Mandióvaran tolla-dvasam=dge (in which, however, we ought to have dvdsam), with the translation at the rising of the banov house (or sign) af Taurus" or "on the day that Napdiśvara was stopped” (id. Vol. XIV. p. 76, ani Coorg Iizsorio. tions, p. 7). But neither rendering is satisfactory ; the latter, in particular. Nothing final can be said until we have a purely mechanical facsimile of the record. But the publiskod lithographe Beern to make it certain that the reading is not tallaj.duasan (accordiog to Mr. Rice), and probable that it is tale-devasam, rather than talpa. derasan (according to Mr. Kittel). And we have the same expression, tale-devasam-dge, in & Cholo ingcrip. tion of A,D, 1082 at Sattaru (Ep. Carr. Vol. III., Nj. 164; treated by Prof. Kielhorn, from another transcript, above, Vol. IV. P. 69), in & passage which mentions tbe full-moon of Kârttika as the tale-deoaga, and then specifies the second tithi (of the dark fortnight) as the date of the record. It Lowes been proposed to translate tale.depusa in this passage by "first day;" in support of which we might quote tale-bdgalu, "front door, principal entrance of a house),' and tale.vidu, '& chief plnoe;' but it is not apparent why the full-moon day, which is the last day of the bright fortnight, should be called " the first day" with reference to the second tithi of the dark fortnight, and still less so why the Nandiśvara day, the eighth tithi, aliould itself be called the first day."

An inscription at Nagarle, in Mysore, dated Ś.-S. 892 (expired), = A.D. 970-71, mentions him as Permidi. Au inscription at Adaragnñchi, in the Dharwar district, with a date in the month Asvayuja, falling in October, A.D. 971, of the Prajâpati samvatsara, S.-S. 893 (expired), mentions him as then governing the Gangnvådi ninety-sis-thousand, the Purigere three-hundred, and the Belvola three-hundred; in the reigu of the Rashtrakůta king Khottiga. An inscription at Gugdür, in the same district, with it date in the month Åsbadha, falling in June, A.D. 973, of the Srimukba samvatsara, S.-S. 896 (current), mentions him as still governing the Puligere three-hundred and the Belpola three hundred, in the reign of Khottiga's successor, Kakka II. The inscription of A.D. 975 at Hebbal, in the sazne district, speaks of him as leaving had in his hands, in the course of his career, the government of a very large area, including not only the Gangaradi province, the Puligere three-hundred, and the Belvola three-hundreul, but also the Noļambavâời thirty-two-thousanii, the Banavåsi twelve-thousand, the Sântalige thousand, and everything included as far as of the great river."

* Ibid. p. 271. 
Above, Vol. IV. p. 350. The word used in the original is perilore, which is a compound from per,' great, and tore, ' stream or river:' in other places, it appears in the forns of perldore and beddore, and we may at any time mert with the later foru heliloje. Kittel's Dictionary gives perdore and Yellore ju the sense of large stream or river,' but without suggesting any identification. And Mr. Rice has said that the term generally denote: the Krishna (Coorg Iulsors.p. 5, note), and line applied it in that sense in an inscription at Basoral in Mysore (Ep. Cari. Vol. III. Md. 122, aud Introd. p. 19). But there are passages in which it certrinly does not denota the Krishnd. The Billdr inscription of A.D. 888 (see page 164 above, under Bútuga L.) speaks of that villago as perdore.gareya Biļiltre (line 8), which may no doubt be literally translated, as was done by Mr. Rice, by " Biliitr of, ie. on, the bank of the vediore, but means more probably "Biļiúr of the district that toas kro201 by the name of) the banks of the peddore, - especially if we pay attention to the expression beddore-gcreya elpadimbarim ent-okkalun in lines 9, 10 of the recoril. And the Peggo-ur inscription of A.D.978 (see page 1973 below, under Rachamalla II.) mentions & certain Rakkasa, described 19 beddore Jareya-dutt-ire (line 8), which may no doubt bo literally translated by 
while governing the bank of the boddore," but neengo much more probably to mean "wbilo governing the district that was known by the name of the banks of the beddore." These two recortie are in Coorg, and belong to that part of the country only. There can be no reference in them to the Krishna, which, eren at the nearest point, is almost three hundred miles away. And Mr. Rice lids suggested (Coorg Tirsers.p. 5, ante) that in these tyo regoris the words peddore and berdore probably denote the Lakatruantirtha. Lu this, be followed Mr. Kittel, who said (Ind. Ant. Vol. VI, p. 100) thnt the term may perlaps dere denoto the Lakshmantirtha, especially berause that river is also called dodda-lo!e, a teren in which doddi, again, mennggrent,' and role is synonymous with tore. Now, perdore would be exactly represented in Snuskrit by naháncdt, which is explninel in Monier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictiomry as meaning 'any great river which has a loug coursu.' The Lakslınjantirtha is 2 perennial riyer, which supplice several important irrigation canals. But its whole course is not more than sixty miles; after which it lows into the Kåvori, There is 10 apparoat Tel.801 why it should be classed among the great rivers, And it seems much more likely to ine that, wo ug was, in fact, suggested as an alternative possibility by Jr. Kittel (loc. cit.),-ju the Biliit and Peggu-ŵr inscriptions, the worls peridore and veditore depote the Kávo, which, with its course of about four hundred and seventy-Gre miles, may fairly be classed among the great rivers of India : the Karert, also, rises in Coorg ; and it runs right through the very centre of the province, whureas the Lakelantirtha only runs for soiuc trenty to tiventy-five wilos through the south-east corner of it; and the province wight be called "the banks of the Kávéri" much more appropriately than "the banks of the Lokslumantirtha..... It inny be noted here that, in Tlincker's Reduced Siliyey Map of India, 1891, and in Constable's Hand Atle of India, 1899, pluto 34, the namo Laksaņtirtha has been applied, not to the Lakshuntirtin itself (which is, in fact, not fully shewn), but to that part of the Kavari which lies in Coorg - The Basarit inscription, mentioned above, defines the limits, apparently in A.D. 1237, of the territory of the Hursula king Vira-Södsrand : and it specifies, on the east, Khichi,-- on the west, Volavura, i.e. Pélúr in the

(11.7, 8), that he overthrew & powerful opponent of Krishna III. named Alla (11. 9, 84),-- that he broke the power of the Kiratas or mountain-tribes in the neighbourhood of the Vindhya mountains (11. 10, 11),-- that he protected the encampment of the emperor (i.e., probably, of Khottiga, or else of Kukka II.). at the town of Mânyakheta (1. 12), S.-- that he crowned Indraraja, se.

Hagsan district, Mssure --- on the north, the perdore,--- and, on the south, a place the name of which Mr. Rice tells us, is dofaced bat looks like Chnlaseravi, and which, he seerns to suggest, may possibly be Chulaseris near Povậui in the Malabar district. Hero, the term perdore cannot denote the Kavêri; because Belúr is to the north of tlint river. Nor can it denote the whole courge of the Krishya : because at that time the Dêrngiri-Yalova king Singhina was in poguession of the territory lying south of the Krishna and west of the Tuógabhadra, as for at any inte as Bananasi. In this record, therefore, perdore probably means the Krisbņå on from the point at sbich the Turgabbaita joins ito In tho Hebbal inscription of A.D, 975, inentioned in the text above, perdore med mean either the Krishnâ towards the north, or the Kareri towards the south. In the Mulgund inscription of this sine year (see pige 171 below, under Paācueladevs), it must mean the Krishna, because of the mention of the buutiiern ocean as the boundary on the south, and because the record itself is to the north of the Kaveri, 
1 Thero is alao a mention of him in a record at Doddabigilu (Ep. Carn. Vol. III., TN. 93); but the record is rather fragineatary, and the pablished text oannot be quoted to any useful purpose. Mr. Rice would find reference to him, under the name of Marasimlavurman, in an inscription at Hale-Bogadi (ibid, My. 15), which mentions also nur Akllavarsla 1.6., doubtless, one or other of the Risbţrakūta kinge named Krisling. But baro the termination 107 mar seems to indicate someone else. 
This person las not yet been identified. As Dr. Haltzsch has reminded me, the name occury in two inscriptions at Gwalior, in the case of Alla, a guardian of the fortrous thore, who 728 & son of Vaillabhatta of the verilen funile (Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p. 154 #.); bis date, however, was A.D. 875-76, & contury before the time of Narasirolia. 
Mångakheta (Målkhed in the Nizam's Dominions) was the Rashtrakūta capita... Sivaka-Harshe, one of the Parimara kings of Milwa, claims to buro taken the wealth of Khottiga in battle, and-apparently, in A.D. 972.78. to lure sacked evo! Alanyakhoţit itself (Ep, Ind. Vol. I, pp. 225, 226). The present passage may mean that. on that occasion, Miresiunla ropulsed the invader at the very gates of Mänyakbéta ; or it may refer to some opent in the warfare between Kakka II, and Taila II. 
- This was evidently done in an attempt to continue the Rashtrakúta sovereignty after the overthrow of Kakka II. by the Westeru Chalukya Tuila II. in A.D. 973 or 974. The attempt is to be attributed to the close copacction that existed betwoon the two families : as we have already been, Bütuga II. was a brother-in-lay of Krishna III., and owed his possession of the Gangavldi province to that king (page 166 uhove); and Indra 1Y. was the son of a son of Krishna III. by & draghter of Ganga-Gângėya, i.e. Butuga II. (Insers, at Gray-Bel. No. 57: Mr. Rice, id. Introd. p. 21, at filrst identified the Ganga-Gå igéys of this record with Rloliinalla II., & successor of Merasimhn; but his grounds for doing so were completely erroneous, and he has now adopted the correct identification in Ep. Carn. Vol. III. Introd. pp. 5, 6). We are also told (again in Insors, at Srav-Belt No. 67) that Indre IV, was the 300-in-law of a person called Rajuchůdamani, "the crest-jewel of kings," whom Mr. Rives (id. Introd. pp. 20, 21) was disposed to identify with a certain Pilla who is mentioned ip apother record at Sravann-Pelgole (No. 58); but it does not seem that the bihuda Rajaohůdąmoni, in that record, is intended to belong to Villa, and it appear's apt at all unlikely that it really denotes Marasimha II. The attempt to carry ou the R&ghtrakit sovereigaby was not saccessful, thongh India IV, lived ou for spme nine years, eventcally dying in A.D. 982 (see Ins048. at Srao.-Ref. No. 57, and Incle Ant. Vol XX. p. 35, where sume cor rections have to be made in the relatiouships stated by mo)- Mr. Rice (Inscrs, at Srav. Bel, Introd. p. 19) would identify the Indiarėja of this passage in the epitaph of Marasińha II. with the Rashtrakuta king Khoftiga ; on the gronnds that, 03 thg 4galogy of the biryds of Nityavarsha Indrs III., tie zleine Indra indicates * Nitgavaralı, ild Nityayarsha was the birida of Klottiga also. But I cannot follow hip in this circular reasoning : " Khottiga" is itself the Pråkrit form of 8 propar name, analogous to " Gojjign” for Göyinde "; and, whatever may bo the Sanskrit word vbioh ib representa, that word is at least not " India." 
This person might be identited with Vajjada IL,, of one of the Kovka branches of the Silandra family, phone initial date is soinewhere 100nt AD, 975.

to him.-- that he reduced the hill-fort of Uchchangi, which even the Kaduvatti, great As was his prowess, had previously failed to reduce (1l. 20, 93), that he destroped a §nbara prince pamed Naraga (11. 21, 54, 96)-- that he made the Choras, the Chòlas, and the Påndyos, as well as the Pallayas, bow down before him (11. 21, 22)--and that he destroyed a Châlubya prince named Râjâditya, who had declared war against him (11, 50, 51) : in recapitulating some of his conquests, lines 100 to 102 add, among the places at which he was victorious, the banks of the river Tapi (the Tapti), the town or village of Gonur,. and Payaseva-köte or the fortress of Påvage :* it says that ho preserved the doctrine of Jipa (1, 22), and founded Jain temples and minastamblucosio at various unusmed places; and finally, as already noted, it tells zs (ll. 110 to 112) that evontually he abilicated, and ended his days in the practice of religion at Bankapur (in the Dharwar district), at the feet of a Jain teacher named Ajitasena. From other source, we learn that llarasimha's successes against Vajjala and at Gonůr and Uchchangi were actually acliieved for him by a minister Larged Chámundarára or Cliyundardja, who wrote the Chứmundaráyu-Purcena? and was a minister of also Ráchamalla II. who came next but one in the succession after Marasin ba II. Thus, another record at Sravana-Belgoļa tells us that " the array of his (Châmandaraya's) onomies was broken, like a herd of deer, on him, resembling a tusked elephant running to and fro (among theme), when he stood in front of the victorious elephant, his lord, the glarions king Jagadókapira-(Marasimha II.), when the latter, at the command of king Indra, lifted up his ar to conquer Vajjaladeva, whose strength was as terrible as that of the ocean disturbed (and bursting its boundaries in the universal disorder) at the end of the age, (and) who was the younger brother of Påtalamalla;" and the Chinundariya-Purina tells 12510 that Chamundaraya was born in the Brahma-Kshatra race, that he was a pupil of Ajitasena -- that his lord was

1 from a transcription which Mr. Rice has kindly sent me, I find that the Midrani inscription of A.D), 74 (see Inscts, at Srao.. Bel, Introd, p. 18, note 7) goeg on to mention & person who was called "the afliction (satngcshtag=samkashtag #samkata) of all people; the orunment of the Pompala family ; bora in the Kaduvutti Me : supreme lord of Xiuchipura ; he w 10 is like a thunderbolt in the vin of bættie;" , ... , lust after this, anfortunately, the record comes to an end, without discinsiug his nams). This showg us that kaduvatti, in line 92-93 of the epitaph, is not a verbal for:n, but is the nominative which is required in apposition with tuma-parakranams and the following verbs. And he can now recognize the same name, for an eacier period, in the Gulginpode Bina inscription No. II., which inentions " the whole of the foroes of the Kaduvatti" (Ind. Ant. Vol. X. p. 89, text live 6). 
* This person has not been identified yet. The same name occurs among the Chalukyas, ahout a century and belf earlier, in the case of Rajaditya, father of the Mahasamanta Buddhavaraan, of the Santika (= Chalukika, Chalakra) race, who is mentioned in the Tørklede giant (above, Vol. III. PP, 57, 58). 
Mr. Rice tells me that Gonur is the village of that name, the Goonoor' of the Indian Atlas, sheet 
a the north-east of Chitaldroog. It may be botad, however, tbat the Madras Portal Directory mentions also a Gonur' in the Salem district, and a Gonura ' in the Bangalore district. 
There is a village named Hawasi (= Plvase) in the Karajgi táluke of the Dharwår district. It is doubtful, bonever, whether this con ba the place intended. 
The word mánastambha, wbioh penns literally column of honour,' is explained by Mr. Bice (Inscre, at Srau - Bel. Introd. p. 19, noto 2) as denoting technically " the elegant tail pillars, with a small pinnoled mantapa at the top, ereated in front of the Jain temples ; * and he refere us to a discussion regarding them in 
Forguầson's Indian and Eastern Architecture, p. 276. 
This person is mentioned again as the teacher of Merasimha's minister Chamundardya (see further ou).

Jagadékavira, otherwise called Noļambakul-Ântaka, i.e. Mârasimba II.,--and that he acquired the biruca of Samaradhuramdhara, "the yoke-bearer or leader in war," from his defeat of Vajjaladêya in "the Kheçaga war,"and the biruda of Varamartanda, "a gun among heroes." from the valour which he displayed in the plain of Gonûr in battle against the Nolambas, and the biruda of Rañarangasimha, "a lion in the battle-field," from his fight at the fort of Uchchangi. The details given in the epitaph and the Purânu indicate, in addition to external fighting, some local insurrections, which must probably be attributed to opportunity afforded by the absence of Mårasimhe on the campaign in Gujarat for Krishna III. And not the least remarkable among them is the statement that he had occasion to despoil the ruler of the Banavâsi country; for, that province had been given to his father by Krishņa III., and pre sumably had passed by inheritance into his own hands. The explanation of this, however, and of the immediately following mention of the reduction of the Mâțuras, seems to be furnished by a record at Déogiri in the Karajgi tâluka, Dhârwâr district, of the tenth century A.D. and referable to A.D. 958, which mentions & Makúsimuntedhépati Sântivarman of the Mâțûra family, with the hereditary title of "sapreme lord of the town of Tribunda pura," and having the Nandana rana-umbrella, the crest of a horse, and the mirror-banner, who was governing the Banarasi twelve-thousand. From A.D. 878, or earlier, to 945, the administration of the Baqavási province was in the hands of the Chellaketana family.3 In A.D. 949-50 Krishna III. gave the province to Butuga II., who doubtless allowed tho Chellaketanus to continue to govern it for hiin. Bütuga must have died a few years before A.D. 963-64, when Alårasimha II. succeeded Rachcha-Ganga. And it would seem that when he died, or else during the time of Rachcha-Gaiga, the Måtüras seized the province from the Chellaketanas, and that they retained it until Mårasimha could make it convenient to reduce them. 
Marasimha II. must have been immediately succeeded by the Dharma-llahürcijidhiraja Satyavákya-Konguņivarma-Paichalad@ya, whom a fragment at Dulgund, in the Dhårvår district, with a date in the Yuvan samvatsara, Saka-Sanavat 897 (expired), falling in Augast, A.D. 975, describes as governing "without any disorder" the whole territory from the eastern, the western, and the southern oceans as far as the great river,"6 Paìchalaciêyn seems, then, to have taken advantage of the confusion that must have attended the over. throw of the Rashtrakůta king Kakka II. by the Western Chalukya Taila II., to set kimself up as an independent king; but he was shortly after wards killed in battle by Taila II. Earlier facts connected with him are to be found in the Adarnguichi inscription, which tells us that in A. D. 971, when Marasimba II. was governing the Gangavaci ninety-six-thousand, the Purigere three-hundred, and the Beļvola three-hundred, uuder the Rashtråkůta king Khoțţiga, he himself Tas govorning small circle of villages which was known as the Sebbi thirty and

It is datud, with full Jetails, in the Kalayukti samvatsara, coupled with Saka-Samoat 522 by mistake for 520 or 523. But the characters place it in the tenth century; and I believe that the real date of it is Monday, 15th November, A.D.958, in the Kalayukti samvatsara. S.-S. 880 expired. It does not register a grant of Innd; and it is, therefore, difficult to 819, at present, why n false date should have been vited in record which, in all other respects, seems to be thoroughly genuine,

The details of the date are Bribaspativarı, h.e. Thursilny, coupled with Bhadrapnda krishạn 2 and the Kangd-samkranti. And the corresponding Englisli date is Thursday, 26th August, A.V. 975: on this day, the Kanya-sankranti occurred at 10 l. 5 u, after mean sunrise (for Ujjain), and the given tithi ended about 26 ininutes earlier, but night doubtless be made the current tithi of the samkrinti by more exact calculations.

probably took its appellation from the ancient namo of Chabbi or Chebbi in the Hubli talaka Dharwâr district, and in the Gundür inscription, which mentions him as governing a ninety. six district in A.D. 973; this ninety-six district has not been identified ; bat possibly the espression is an abbreviation for the Gangavadi ninety-sis-thousand, which Marasimha II.... who is mentioned in the same record in connection with the government of only the Purigere three-bundred and the Belvola three-hundred, under Khottiga's successor Kakka II., --- mar have entrusted to Panchaladêva, in the course of ridding himself of the cares of office before passing into religious retirement at Bankåpur. The Mulgund inscription describes Païchalo. dêva as Chrilukya-pañohûnana, “a lion to the Chalukyas,' and also as "subsisting (like a bea) on the waterlilies that were the feet of Chaladuttaranga, Jagadékavira, the glorious Nolambakni Antakadêra :" these epithets both stand in the string of titles that precedes the mention of Panchaladó va's name; and the second of them, while capable of being interpreted to mean that Marasimha II. was still alive, in retirement at Bankậpur, in August, A.D. 975, may perhaps refer to only the previous relations between the two persons. 
Shortly after Pañchaladeva, there was Râchamalla II., who had the full strle of the Dharma-Maharajadhiraja Satyavákya-Konguņivarma-Permanadi-Rachamalla. An inscrip tion at Pepo Il-Qr, iu Coory, which mentions hím by all his appellations, furnishes a date for him in the month Phålguna (Feb.-Mazch), falling in A..D. 978, of the Isvara sancatsara, Suka-Samyat 899 (expired), anel speaks of a certain Rakkasa, with the biruda of Asnanabanta, if the warrior of his elder brother," who was governing the district called "the banks of the great river;"3 and an inscription at Dodda-Homma, in Mysore, * which, however, does not mention hiin by his proper nane, perhaps furnishes for him (or else for Pañchaladêva) a date in the preceiling year. He was probably the last of the great Western Ganga princes; and his final date seems to be A.D 98.40 Châmunda râya, who has already been mentioned in connection with Darasimha II., was a míuister of Richamalla II. also; and, while holding office under this master, he caused to be made the colossal Jain image of Gommata or Gommațêśvara at Srayana Belgola, and attained so great a reputation for devotion to the faith to which he bolonged, that he was remembered loog after his death, and was quoted as one of three special promoters of

POSTSCRIPT While the first proofs of the ahove article were passing through the Press. I began to mi * Trillcr examination, than bas ilg yet been attempted, of the dates of the spurious records Western India, for all of which there should be some explanation forthcoming, if we can o find the clue to the solution of them. 
I have referred to two of these clates in note 2 on page 157 above. One of them is fr the spurious Tanjore grant (Ind. Ant. Vol. VIII, p. 212), which purports to give a cate A.D. 248 for an imaginary Western Ganga whose name is given in this record as Arifarm by a mistake-(dae to the carelessness of the writer in writing, in lino 10, sramaderirarn instead of śrīmuliharivarnima, de, in omitting a subscript ah)--for the Harivarman of other spurious records of the same series. The details of the date are the Prabhava samvatru coupled with Sakı-Santat 169 expired, the noit-moon tithi of Phâlgiina, Friday, the Rør takshatra, the Vriddhi yógii, and the Vrishabha lagna. And, in the period to which 1 concoction of this record is to be referred on palæographic grounds, I find that in the Prabha suum vatsara, S.-S. 1009 expired, the new-moon tithi of Phålguen ended on Friday, 21 February, A.D. 1088. The moon, indeed, was not then in Revati, aud did not come to Roy till about 4 hrs. 28 min, after mean sunrisa on the Saturday: but the moon often is in Rêvati the per-moon day of Phalguna, and may possibly have been actually so shown for that day 6.-S. 1009 expired by an erroneous almanac or by a calculation forked out wrongly for 1 person who fabricated the l'ecord; or the forgor may have added that detail on chance, sim to give a grcater air of plausibility to the record, as he certainly did in respect of the Vrids burce, which cannot ever occur on the new-moon day of Phålguna.? The result of the 25 February, A.D. 1088, fully meets the palæographic requirements of the case, and, I belio fixes the actual time at which this record as concoctod : viz., the forgor was working on, had in vierr, Friday, the new-moon day of Phålguna of the Prabhaya samvatsara, S.-S. 10 expired; and be produced the necessary appearance of antiquity by striking off from the Sa year, in order to suit, more or less, a fictitious pedigree and chronology that had alrea become established and well-known, and at the same time to obtain a sa invatsura wh would be correct according to the southern Iuni-solar system,-- exactly fourtecn of the six FCA cycles, and thus obtained the year S.-S. 169 expired which he actually qnoted in 1 l'ecord, 
The second of the two dates to which I have referred in note 2 on page 157 above, is 414 the spurious Merkara grant (Ind. Ant. Vol. I. p. 363, and Coorg Insors. p. 1), which has be supposed to give a date in A.D. 466 for an imaginary Western Ganga named A finita-Korgu This date has to be explained in a different way. The details of the date are the year 388, 1 specified either as current or as expired, the fifth tithi of the bright fortnight of Mag. Monday, and the Spåti nakshatra. The sainvatsara is not specified ; and so we bavo not 1 particular help that we have in the case of the Tanjore grant. Also, the era is not specifi As regards this detail, ii bas always been assumed that the Saka era was intended, with 1 
1 The verse, which mentions Chamundarāya as“ Råya, the minister of king Rachamalla," is to be for about half-way through Inscrs, at Srau-Beļ. No. 137. 
7 At sanrise on the Friday in question, the yôga mar Subha ; and the Vșiddhi yoga had occurred abont ple days earlier. The remaining detail, ibe Trishabha lagna, melns only the rising of the sign Taurus. I caxi calculate it with the Tables available to me; but it vould naturally occur at some tipe or other during twenty-four hours of the Friday. 
3 The Tanjore grant was certainly not the earliest of the spurious records in order of fabrication,

him an inscription at Külagere, in Mysore, which mentions the ruling prince as the Dharma Maháráridhiraja Nitimârga-Konguņivarma-Permanaại, and is dated Saka-Samyat 831 (expired), = A.D. 809-910. The Iggali inscription has given a date for him in A.D. 891-92. That, however, is a date for him in the time of bis predecessor. And, from an inscription at Honnayakanhalli, it would appear that his rule began in S.-S. 815 (expired), =A.D. 893-94,8 It would seem that he did not secure the succession without some opposition. We have, just after the date mentioned above for the commencement of bis rule, an inscription at Tâyalar, in Mysore, .e. within the Western Ganga territory, which is dated $.-S. 817 (expired), =AD. 895-96, and mentions, as then reigning or ruling, a certain Nolambadhiraja--that is to say, the Pallava prince of the Noļambavådi province. The explanation of this is evidently furnished by the statement in the Begûr inscription that, when that record was drawn up, Ereyappa was governing, after having deprived all his enemies of their power; plainly, bis accession to the leadersbip of the Western Gangas was opposed, and chiefly by the Pallavas of Noļambayadi, who succeeded in occupying for a time part at least of his here ditary possessions. 
From the Atakar inscription, we know that Ereyappa had a son named Rachamalla I., and that it was by fighting and killing Råchamalla that another member of the family, Bataga II., obtained the succession. As will be seen further on, this occurred in or before A.D. 940. We have no records attributable to Rachamalla 1. But the length of time from the initial 
note 3), appears to have obtained evidence that Ayyapadeva wag & Pallava. The evidence seems to be the Hirê. Bidanur inscription (mentioned by Mr. Rico as the Goribidaur inscription in Mys. Inscrs. Introd. p. 45), which, according to a transcription that Mr. Rice has kindly sent me, distinctly mentions Ayyapadéra 48 Pallap-Arvaya and 49 baving also the name of Nolambadhiraja.. 
1 Ep. Carn. Vol. III., M. 30.-- As I have already intimated (page 162 above), og identifications, apon which this part of the succession is arranged, must be takeo &s tentative for the present; the miscellaneous subordinate items of information, contained in the records at present available, do not help at all; and we waut more facsimiles in the case of records which are not dated. Bat my identifications aro at gay rate more egtisfactory than those proposed by Mr. Rice. Thus (ibid. Introd. p. 4, and see also his Clagsified Liat which follows page 36), be would identify the Nitimárge of the Ktlagere inscription, and Breyappa, with, respectively, the Nitindrga and his son Satyavakya (whom I identify with Raņavikrama, the son, and Rajamalla, the graudson, of Mattarasa) of the Doddahundi inscription (page 163 above); whereas, the date of the Külagere inscription, and the period in which we must of necessity places Eresappa, are altogether inconsistent with the use of the old form of the ka in tha Doddahnindi inscription. Ard he would farther identify with the Nitimárga of the Kulagera inscription the 
Satyardkya (whom I identify with Båtage I.) of the Iggali inscription (page 164 above); whereas, it geems clear to me thata Nitimârga is not to be identified with any Satyavákya. 
? Mentioned by Mr. Rice in Ep. Carn. Vol. III. Introd. p. 4. I assume that Mr. Rice means that this record actually contains the appellation of Nitimarga, and that he does not simply allot it to a Nitiinarge (namely, to the Nitimârga to whom he would allot also the Doddahundi and Kulagere recorde) on some merely inferontial grounds, 
: Here, again, I am dealing with only the really important records. Other records of Erepappa, in 3. Carn. Vol. III., are TN. 116, at Bannůr, and Nj. 78, at Husukura. For others which meation him with his predecessor, and for one which may belong to either of them, see page 164 above, note 4. And we may perhaps allot to him recorda of & Nitimdrga at Kannegåla (TN, 180), and at Gattav&di (Nj. 98). 
2. Corn. Vol. III, Md:18. Mr. Rice (ibid. Introd. p. 4) spenks of it 48 " apparently an independent pont by Nolambadhiraja," but also suggests that Nolanbadhiraja was " perhaps subordinate to Nitimirga," is to Freyappa. I think, however, that the true explanation is that which I suggest. He also (loo. cit.) groposer to treat as "an intrusive Pallapa inscription another record at Tiyalur (Md. 14, with a lithograph), which is dated in the month Sravana (July-Aug.), Saka-Sarevat 829 (expired), falling in A.D. 907 : bere, however, there is nothing to refer the record to any particolar family ; it only registers & grant made by villagers, and it does not mention the ruler at all. 
Sed page 166 £., below. . The Homcha inscription (880 page 168 above, note 4) appears to give his name in the form of Rajamalia; 88, algo, probably does the sparious Sadi grant (page 167 below, note 2), The Sadi grant woald gire him the appella tion of Nitim$rge, and the bisuda of Kachcheya-Ganga, " the quarrelsome or fighting Ganga ; " but the Humaba inoription appears to phew Rajamalla and Kachchega Garga 88 separato persons.

1 It is probable that the year m'&389 current; and he may have turned it into 388 in order to cite the expired year. Be that as it may, instauces of thie quotation of a wrong year cao be adduced from unquestionably genuine dates, And, among the spurious dates, ao interesting and instructive instance is furnished by the Kurtakoti grant (Ind. Ant. Vol. VIL p. 217), which purports to be of the time of the Wostern Chalukya king Vikramaditya I, and to be dated Sake Sarnvat 630 (or 532) expired: the details of this data are correot- (except that the solar eclipse, quoted as a total one and described conventionally As such, was an annular eclipse; to the extent, however, of eight and a half digits, and therefore & well-inarked one) for Sunday, 11th May, A.D), 1119, in 
and in the year 529 (current) of the era of A.D. 590-91: here, the forger produced the necessary semblauce of antiquity by distinctly quoting the year of the later era as a Saka year; and here, Again, be intentionally omitted to quote the samvatsara, because he knew that the samontsarn for $.

TRANSLATION, 
After the exclamations Om !, Hail !, the record opens with a verse, a good deal of which is illegible and cannot be restored, but wbich is directed to the praises of a person not mentioned in it by name apparently, but identical of course with the Mårasimba of the rest of the record, who is here described as enjoying, through the power of the sword of his arm, the whole earth, up to the ocean, as being a very jewel to adorn the kings of the Ganga lineage, and as darkening, like a bank of clouds, the moon that was the faces of the women of his foes. It then proceeds]: 
(Line 4) - Om! Om! Om! Ornate prose :- Let the record of the process and the record of the piety of him, the glorions Nolambaku!-Ântakadêva,— who played the part of

who was a very Triņêtre (Śiva) among chieftains, at that time when the skull-pearers, 1 having cut off (and arranged) in a string all the newly decapitated heads of the Pallavas, (and) having greatly tottered (under the burden of them), (and) having placed (them) on the ground, made proclamation to the other chieftains and said " Aho! Let not your own newly decapitated heads come into this string; bat, having seen (what has happened to the Pallavas), preserve yourselves (by timely submission) in the ranks of (living) men !" The achievement of him, the king Ganga of Gutti, became the theme of praise in all the three worlds.- the achievement of taking, amidst a slaughter of the (whole) earth, the great fortress of Johchangi, which previously had been found impregnable by (even) ...... the Kåduvatti, posgessed of eminent prowess, who, inspiring terror for some time, surrounded and besieged (it), but had to quit (it). Kanda :- With the very greatest ease, the head of Naraga, who had acquired such fame that he was considered to be a very Kåla or Ravana or Sisupala, (but) who became (his) bondsman, fell into the hand of him, the crest-jewel of the Gangas. He has spoken, (and) he will protect; let not your courage fail;' the protection of Yama (shall be with you) : he will give you that which he has promised : shall any of the deeds or words of him, the crost-jewel of the Gangas, ever fail? 
(L. 100) - Om! Having thus fought (and) conquered (the aforesaid enemies, and numerous other people, on the banks of the Tåpî in the neighbourhood of the forests of the Vindhye mountains, at Mânyakheta the best of towns, at Gonûr, at Uchchangi, in the Banavâsi country, at the fortress of Påvase, and in various other localities, (and) having set ap great banners at various places, (and) having bestowed great gifts, he, the glorious Nôlambakul-Antakadêve, who had (thus) become famous,--(who had the titles of the Vidya. dhara of the Gaogas, the hero among the Gangas, the lion of the Gangas, the crest-jowel of the Gangas, the Ganga Kandarpa (god of love), the Ganga diamond (or thunderbolt), the lintel of firmness of character, the Ganga of Gutti, the incarnation of religion, the sole hero of the world, the keeper of promises, the sun (for the destruction) of enemies, the roagh in battle, the very Triņštra (Siva) among chieftains.Caused to be made, at various places, Jain temples and mánastambhas. (May there be) aqspiciousness ! 
(L. 110) Om! Having carried out acts of religion in a most worthy fashion, one year later he laid aside the sovereignty, and, at the town of Bankapura, in the performance of worship in the proximity of the holy feet of the venerable Ajitasena, ha observed the vow (of fasting) for three days, and attained rest. 
(L. 112)- Metre :- Aho! Chola king, quiet down by gentle rabbing (thy palpitating) heart !; O Pandya, cease thy ......, and give up weeping !; O Pallava, run not away in fear; 0 , ... . . retreat not from thy territory, (but) romain .....! the Ganga chieftain, Noļamb-Åntaka, has gone in triumph to the abode of the gods !

For "the Kiduvatti," see page 171 above, note l. In line 92, I analyse bitta ungada, The latter word may possibly be a proper 18de; or it may be something similar to gada,' indeed, certainly;" or it may perhape sland for eggadu, uggota, - utkafa, 'excess; affliction, trouble.' 
1 In oide, we bave another variant of erde, code,' the chest, (the heart), courage ;' it occan again in line 114. For erde-gidu, codrage to fail,' sed Kittel's Dictiouety, under erde, 
+ Dalama, banger,' probably stands bere for dhraja-stambha, 'flag-stafi," i.e. A stone column representing S vanner.

No. 19.- ASSAM PLATES OF VALLABHADEVA; 
SAKA-SAMFAT 1107. BIK, KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E.; GÖTTINGEN. These plates belong now to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, to which they were presented by Mr. W. Winckler, Assistant Executive Engineer of Tezpur, the chief town of the Darrang district of Assam, Constable's Ilund- Atlas of India, Plato 30 Bb. The text of the inscription has already been published by Dr. Hultzsch, in the Zeitschrift D. Allorg. Ges. Vol. XL. p. 42 ff. I ro-edit the inscription from excellent impressions which were taken by Dr. Fleet in February 1880, and given to me by him some years ago. 
Those are five copper-plates, the first and last of which are inscribed on one side only, and each of which measures from 748" to 8" broad by from 51" to 53" high. Plates i to ivy are numbered with uuncral figures, which are engraved on the proper right margin of the second side of each plate. In the middle of the upper part each plate has a hole, for a ring, which bad been ont already when the impressions were taken. The ring is 1" in diameter and 3" thick; on it there slides another, thin peau-shaped ring, the ends of which are joined and irere evidently run into the socket of a seal; but the seal is not now forthcoming. Some sides of the plates are quite smootli, others have rims, partly raised and partly fashioned; but, on every side, the writing is in a perfect state of preservation. The engraving is good throughout; the letters are shallow and, though the plates are thin, do not shep through on the backs. The average size of the letters is about 1'-The characters belong to a variety of the northern alphabet which was used, about the 12th century A.D.,80 far as I can judge at present, in the most eastern parts of Northern India. They closely resemble those of the Deopara inscription of Vijayasêna, published with a photolithograph in Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p. 305 ff., and apparently also those of the three Sûna copper-plate inscriptions, published with indifferent photolithographs (or lithographs) in the Journal Beng. As. Soc. Vol. VII. p. 43 ff., Vol. XLIV, P. I. 2. 11 ff., and Vol. LXV. P. I. p. 6 ff. That this alphabet belongs to Eastern India, is shewn at once by signs like those for et (0.4. in état, 1. 47), khu (in kla-dalé khalı, l. 2), jika and riga (in Vihtarikasimhasya, 1. 23, a id marigalasya, 1. 3), ta (in tuti-prakatd, 1. 2), ta (in bhagavaté, I. 1), atc., as well as by the numeral figuregó ou the margins of the plates ; and signs like those for ja, (in jagatain, 1. 3), pha (in Baphalita), l. 15), la (in kha-dalt, 1, 2), and especially those for jha (in jháța, l. 41), and for the initial i (in iti, 11. 49 and 54), together with other peculiarities which the characters of this inscription have in common with those of the Deopars inscription, clearly distinguish the alphabet here used from another variety of eastern writing. As a trustworthy photolithograph 
Il trke this information from Dr. Hultzsol's account of the issoription. 
When I suggestert to Dr. Hultzsch the great desirability of having the plates photolithographed, he most readily gave his perinission to do so, and bimself requested me to ra-edit this record. The pliotolithograph has been prepared under Dr. Fleet's supervision. 
I do not know whether there is a nuneral figure on the second side of the fifth plate; there is none on the first side of it 
Seo above, Vol. IV. p. 256. 
$ The Bgores for '' and '3' are the same as those used in the Gast Buddhist inscription, Ind. ant. Vol, X. p. 342, Plate, that for' 2' occurs, in the same foria, in the last line of the Tarpaadight plate of lakolmanneona, Jour. Beng. 48. Soc. Vol. XLIV. P. I. p. 12 (whero it has been mistaken for '3'); and that for *4' in line 63 of the Kanaali plates of Vaidyadáva, to be mentioned below. The sine plates, in line 58, and the Govindpur inscription of Gangadhara (to be mentioned below), in line 35, have a different form of 1. 
I allude to the alphabet uged, e.g., in the Kanauli plates of Vaidysdøra of Praujy dtishn, published with a plotolithograph in En, Ind. Vol. II. p. 347 ff. One special feature of that alphabet, which is essentially the same All that of the Govindpur inscription of the poet Gangadhara, publisiled ibid. p. 330 ff, is, that many letters, at the top, have a kind of triangle. Aud anotler peculiarity is, that the letter y, before another consonant, is denoted by a short line which is sideways attached, on the proper sight, to the middle of the akshare of which , forms part. In the Govindpur inscription r is so written in all conjuncts ; in the Kardaali plater, this 
182 
EPIGRAPHIA INDICA, 
[VOL. T. 
is published here with, I need not attempt a minute description of all individual characters, but one or two more general points muy be drawn attention to. Io deciphering the text, as Tas stated already by Dr. Eultzsch, a difficulty is occasionally caused by the great similarity of tro or aven three different letters. Thus, it is not always easy to distinguish bettyeen p and y, between n and 7 (compare ralini-dalasya, I. 6). between ch and " (compare kiri chandran, 1. 9), ch and v (compare rachöbhir=, 1. 32), v and dh (compare vadhú-vaidhavya-, 1. 11), or between the subscript zandr (compare induk, 1. 4, and ®ragendrari, 1.7); and where letters like these happen to occur in proper names such as we find in lines 36 and 43-49, it is impossible to youch for thi: absolute correctness of the transcribed text. Another matter which may be mentioned is, that for some letters te have two or more different forms. This is particularly the case with the subscript u, but also, e.g., with ! and dh ; (for the forms of u compare Vasudevaya, 1, 1, byumaninit, l. 4, Opeinadyugé, 1. 8, induk, 1. 4, aud punitu, 1.5; for those of 1, kiralu, 1.2, Lampadaraḥ, 1.3, and kili-kula, 1. 25; and for those of dlı,dhirita, 1.6, and khadg-uyudha, 1. 34). I may also state that the letter r', where it immediately precedes another consonant, is written by the ordinary superscript sign, except in the conjuncts rgg, ram, and rth, the formsl of which may be seen from stargga, l. 38, Udayakarınaḥ, l. 17, and 'tyartham, l. 15. In the word varnnérali in lino 2, the superscript has been wrongly engraved on the top of an akshara which would be rnnni, already without it. The sign of aragrala is not used in the inscription ; nor are there any special signs for final covsodants. The sign of anusvára is always written above the line and is nowhere employed in the interior of a simple word, instead of tho nasal of one of the five classes ; and the sign of visarga, differing from the sign Thich is used in the Deopara inscriptions, is much like an English 8, except that often, at the bottom, it has a short tail. The language 
CS 
sign for r is generally used when the sign of the consonant with which yr is combined has a triangular top, as is the case in conjuncta like rock, rchchli, rii, rit, rdd, rudh, rll, rvo, etc. Neither of these two peculiarities is found in the Deopars ingeription or in the inscription bere edited. It is true that in these inscriptions the signs of certain aksharas, such as Wu, til, fra, tri, trai, etc., wore or less frequently, have an angular top, but we nowhere see the triangle; and ruerer is denoted in them of the side-line, described above, [Iu lipes 1--46 of Vaidyadora's inscription, according to Dir. Venis's edition, the letter y, as the first part of a conjunct, is omitted by the engraver 36 times,-tirice (according to the impressions only once) before y, once before 7, and 110 less than 33 times where the re would ordinarily be denoted by the side-live. According to iny experience, this side live generally is very thin and shallow in the original iuscriptions, so that often it does not sberat all clearly in the impressions; and, in the crise of Vaidyndéra's plates an examination of four impressions, of which I ove one to Mr. Venis himself and three to Dr. Führer, enables me to state with confidence that the engraver is not guilty of so many omissioug As would seem to occur at first sight.) - As regards the letter jh, it will suffice to cowpare the sign for jl (wbich is almost eractly like the jh of the modern Bengali) in jhata in line 41 of the present inscription, and that for jjh in the alish ura jjhi (notjhi) of ujjhita in line 21 of the Denpara inscription, with the unite different signs for the same letters in the words jhațiti and ujjhita in lines 28 and 7 of Vaidyadora's plates, The initial iu the Gorind pur inscription, is denoted by tiro ciroles, placed side by side, with a kind of circonia above them :ad in Vaidyadeva's plates fre bare two signs for i, one with two circles below (as in iti, l. 3), and the othier with the two circles at the top (as in sua, I. 43, and iman, 1, 66), both quite different from the į of the 
usoription here edited. [I maj mention that Vaidyadêra's plates furnish two corresponding forins of the rare initial t. One of them occurs at the end of line 40, in Pei, where the photolithograph omits the tertical line between the tro circles, by which t is distinguished from s, and which is perfectly clear in the impressions and the other formi te base in the word tšdna, in line 54, tbe 1 of which has been erroneously taken to be ai. If I had to guerest special names for the tiro varieties of the alphabet spoken of above, I, svith my present knowledge should call that of Vaidyadiva's plates the Pala, and the other the Saue varietr. 
The same signs, thich of course ove their origiu to the fact that the siga for was written on, not abore, the top-line, are used in the Deopara inscription and elsewhere. 
The same mistake has made by the engraver of the Gaubaţi plates of Indrapalavarman (Jour. Beng. Ato Sor. Yol LEVI. P. I. p. 123 #.) in the Ford arnnava, Plate iia, 1.5; compare the proper sign for rind, without the superscript sign for , in varina, ibid. Plate 11b, I. 2. The sigo transcribed by anya (corrected to trunya), ibid. Plate Lin. 1. 3. is really innya in the original. Whether in the Gagbati plates, in the conjunct rgg, she is written on or above the line, it is dificult to decide. 
The ton circles were joined, so as to enable the writer to form the sign of visargez with one stroke of the pel. To i similar process we ove the form of the initial , bere used.

ASSAM PLATES OF VALLABHADEVA. 
183 
? 
of the inscription is Sanskrit, and, with the exception of the introductory ôn ônz mamo bhagavaté Vásudéraya, the whole is in verse. Of unusual words, or words used in an unusual sense, the text offers nárapatya, 1. 20, rule, reign,' Kasa(sa)ra, 1. 33, a buffaio,' chhurikiri 1. 34, one who is skilled in the une of the dagger,' jhata in the technical expression sa jháta-vițapa, 1. 41, 'with the woods and thickets,' and dikarshaka, 1. 45, 'the extent (of a piece of land). In respect of orthography the following points may be noted : The letter b is written by the sign for v; the palatal and dental sibilants are confounded in sansira (for samsúra), l. 25, kásara, 1. 33, simu, l. 42, ssingåra, l. 24, subhé and sasté, 1. 41; the guttaral Dasal is employed instead of the sign of anusvára in the word vanía, 11. 9, 16, and 52; before y, l is doubled in sallyasya, 1. 31; and eight times the rules of samdhi have not been observed in regard to the final consonant of a word before a following consonaut. Besides it may be noted that in line 21 samutssitáni is used instead of samuchchhritâni. 
The inscription is one of a prince Vallabhadêrs of whom, in verses 3-10, the following genealogy is given : In the race of the Moon there was a certain Bhaskara ; his son was the king or chief Râyâridêva-Trailókyasimha (whose wifel uus Vasumati ?); his son, again, was Udayakarņa-Nihsankasimha, whose wife was Ahiavadêvi ; and their son was Vallabhadeva-Sriyallabha. Nothing of "historical importance is recorded of any of these chiefs. 
According to verses 15-22, Vallabhadeva, at the time of the sun's progress to the north in the Saka year 1107 (giveu in numerical words), at the cominand of his father and for the spiritaal welfare of his mother, founded an alms-house or place for the distribution of food (bhakta-fuli, anna-sattra), nenr a temple of the god Mabådéva (Siva) to the east of Kirtipur in the Hâpyachâ: district mandala); endowed it with the revenues of) certain villages and hamlets the names and boundaries of which are given, and (so far as I understand the text) assigned the services of five men, whose names also are recorded, and of their families. 
The localities mentioned in the inscription I am unable to identify. The date does not admit of verification ; it would correspond to the 25th December of either A.D. 1184 or 1185, according as the Saka year 1107 is taken as a current or an expired year.

(V.5.) He, king Røyårideva, the frontal ornament of the kings in Bhåskara's race, it was, who, at the gorgcous festival of battle which was fearful on account of the presence of the lordly elephants of Vanga, made the enemy abandon the entire practice of arms on the battle-field; and who, in his own person, rendered the creation of the Lion of the three worlds' exceedingly fruitful."

Editor of the Epigraphic Indica having procured the original plates from the Secretary of the Society and having got a new facsimile prepared, I now publish a revised edition of my paper on those plates. 
The plates are three in number, each being about one foot in length and about eight inches in breadth. The inscription is engraved on one side of the first plate, on both sides of the second, and on one side of the third. The letters are carefully and well formed in the first part, but in the latter the work is negligently done, and in consequence several letters look alike. The seal bear's & figure of Siva,l

The grant was made by Krishna III. Or Akâlavarsha of the Râshtrakůta family in the name of his brother Jagattunga (11. 48 f. and 51), while staying at hig capital Manyakheta (1. 46 f.), in the year 882, expired, of the Saka era, corresponding to 940-41 A.D., on the 5th tithi of the dark half of Vaisakha, the cyclic year being Sârvarin (1. 47 f.).

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA, 
[VOL. V. 
This grant cleaus ap several doubts and difficulties as regards the genealogy of the Rashtrakůtas. In the first place, the Rashtrakůta family is said to have spring from the Satyaki brauch of the Yadava race and to be known by the name of Tunga (verse 6). The genealogy begins with Dantidurga (v. 8), as it was he who acquired for his family the supreme sovereignty of Maharashtra or the Dekkan, the limits of which were the Narmada in the north and the Tungabhadri in the south. He was succeeded by his paternal uncle Krishna I, who is represented to have decorated the earth with many temples of Siva, which looked like the Kailasa mountain (p. 9). I have shown in my Early Dekkan History that a temple of exceedingly great beauty was caused to be constructed at Ellora by this Krishparaja, and have said that it was perhaps the Kailisa itself. I should have said that it could be no other than the Kailasa. For, if the demigods saw it while moving in the sky in their aerial cars, and were struck with its beauty, as stated in the Baroda inscription, the temple must have had a carved exterior; i.e. it must have been a temple entirely cut out from the rock, and not a mere cave temple without an architectural exterior. There is one such only at Ellora, and that is the Kailâga. The comparison, made in the present grant, of the temples constructed by Krishnaraja with Kailâss points, I believe, in the same direction. 
The circumstances under which Dhruva Nirupama superseded his brother Govinda II. are distinctly giver. Sensual pleasures made Gövinda careless of the kingdom; and, entrusting the affairs of the state to bis younger brother, he allowed the sovereign power to drop away from his bands (v. 10). Nothing particular' is stated about Gôvinda III. or Jagattunga. His son, known as Amôghavarsha, the great patron of the Digambara Jainas, is here called Nřipatunga (v. 12), which name is found in & Jaina work also. The city of Manyakheta, which, in one grant, is mentioned as simply ilourishing in his time, is represented here to have been founded by him. His son, Krishna II., who is also known by the name of Akalavarsha, is spoken of as a powerful prince, and several particulars are given about him, He frightened the Gurjara, destroyed the pride of the Lâţa, taught humility to the Gaudas, and his command was obeyed by the Anga, the Kalinga, the Gânga and the Magadha (v. 13). As this Krishparaja was not the reigning prince, whom the writer of the charter might be suspected of flattering, and as the grant is not reticent about the faults also of some of the other princes, this account may be relied on as true. Akála varsha is represented as a powerful prince in the Prašasti at the end of the Uttara-Purana of the Jainas also. The Lata prince alluded to seems to have belonged to the Gujarât branch of the Rashtrakúta family, which was founded in the time of Govinda III. or Jagattuiga, who assigned the province of Láta, that he had conquered, to his brother Indra. Akalayarsha, the grandson of Jagattunga, seems thus to have humbled or aprooted his kinsmen of the Liaţa country. 
Jagattanga was the name of Akälavarsha's son. From the mere fact of the mention of his name in the grants, he was supposed to have been a reigning prince; and, following others, I stated in the first English edition of my Early Dekkan History that he became king after his father. But from a number of circumstances it soon appeared to me that he could not have been an actual king, and in the Marathi edition of the work I corrected that statement. This inference of mine has now been confirmed by the grant before us, in which he is represented to have been taken away by the creator to heaven without having succoeded to the throne, as if through the solicitations of the heavenly damsels who had heard of his beauty (v. 14). Akálavarsha was thus succeeded by his grandson Indra III., the son of Jagattunga. 
There has hitherto been some confusion as regards the next prince, named Amôghavarsha, who was the son of Indra III. He is not mentioned by name or as a king in the Sangali grant of his brother and successor, but is noticed in the Khârêpåtan grant; while, in the third and only other grant which gives us information about the two princes, there is a mistake which has led all writers on the subject to drop Govinda IV. altogether and regard Amoghavarsha as 
No. 20.] 
DEOLI PLATES OF KRISHNA III. 
the only prince. But the grant before us clears the difficulty. Amöghavarsha is there spoken of as “having immediately gone to heaven, as if through affection for his father" (v. 17). He reignen therefore for a very short time (for a year, as stated in the Bhâdâna grant published after this), and hence is not noticed in the Sångali grant. The next prince, Govinda IV., is of course highly praised in his Sångalî grant. But the grant before us represents him to be & prince addicted to sensual pleasures, and to have died an early death on account of his vicious courses (v. 18). The Khârépâtan grant agrees with it in speaking of him as the abode of the dramatic sentiment of love" and as " surrounded by women." 
Our grant agrees also with that found at Khårêpåtan in representing his successor as a very virtuous prince. His name was Amôghavarsha, and he was the son of Jagattunga, and consequently the uncle of Govinda IV. He assumed the throne, being entreated to do so by the feudatory chiefs, who thought there was none else able to maintain the power of the Rêshtrakůtas (v. 19). The Khârêpåtan grant gives his proper name, which was Baddiga. He was assisted in the government of the kingdom by his son Krishna III., who was engaged in wars with his neighbours and subjugated Dantiga and Vappuka (v. 22). He uprooted Rachhyamalla and placed on the throne in the Ganga country (Giigapäti, ie, Gangavådi) a prince of the name of Bhûtârya (v. 23). In an inscription at Ätakûr, noticed by Mr. Rice? and published by Dr. Fleet, one Bütuga is represented to have killed a prince of the name of Râchamalla and to have made himself master of the Ganga country. Båtuga assisted Kannaradêva, 2.e. Krishna III., who is mentioned at the beginning of the inscription, in destroying Räjäditya, the Chôļa king, and received a reward from him. Bütuga is elsewhere called Bûtayya, and our Bhûtärya is a Sanskritised form of this, while our Rachhyamalla is clearly the Råchamalla of the Âtakûr inscription. But in the latter, Krishna's connection with the destruction of Rachamalla and the rise of Bûtayya are not mentioned. The reason probably is that it was not necessary to state the fact in that manner. But there can be no question that Båtayya was assisted by Krishna III. and owed his elevation to him, since, in the fight with Râjåditya, Bútayya acted as if he was his feudatory and received a reward as from a master. The name of the Pallava whom Kșishņa III. is stated to have subdued was Anniga (v. 24). Who the Dantiga and Vappuka were, that be put down, it is difficult to say; but the former name was borne by some Pallava rulers of Kanchi, 
On the death of Amôghavarsha, which seems to have taken place a short time before the date of this grant, Krishna III, ascended the throne (v. 28). He was called Akálavarsha also, as the other princes of this dynasty, bearing the name Krishna, were. Here too the present grant clears up a difficulty. Misunderstanding a passage in the Karda grant, Krishna III. is made by writers on this dynasty to be an elder brother of Amoghavarsha, and another Kșishna is brought in, who is identified with one of his younger sons, who never reigned, but is represented to have reigned and is called Krishna IV. In my Early Dekkan History I have given the true sense of the passage and shewn the mistakes. The Khârêpåtaạ grant, which gives the true relationship and is perfectly clear on the points, was disregarded. But now the present grant confirms the account in the Khårépåtan plates, so far as it goes, and, according to thera both, Baddiga or Anôghavarsha had no brother of the name of Krishpa who conld have preceded or succeeded him; the king who preceded him was his nephew Govinda IV.; and the Krishna who succeeded him was his son. There wag no other Krishņa, who followed this last and could be called Krishna IV., according to any of our authorities. Jagattunga, the brother of Kșishna III., in whose name the grant of the village is made, must have died before him; for the latter was succeeded by Khottigl, who appears to have been Krishnaraja's step brother according to the Kardâ grant, and he was followed by the son of his brother Nirupama.

(Continued from page 49.) 
A. RAJARAJA. NO. 27.. Inscription in the Vaikuntha-Perumal temple at Manimangalam. 1 [Ti " Jrn-magal pôl . 2 k-iyêpda 15vadu Isha[bha]-nå[ya]ixu půrvva-be (pa)ksbattu [da]šamiya[m*] 
Viyala-kilam[ai]yu[m pjerra [A]ttattiņ mål. * In the 15th year (of the reign) of ....... on the day of Elasta, which corresponded to & Thursday and to the tenth tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Rishabha." 
As Rajaraja's reign has been found to commence between the 24th December A.D. 984 and (approximately) the 29th August A.D. 985 (above, p. 48, No. 25), & date in the month of Rishabha (April-May) of the 15th year of his reign will be expected to fall either in A.D. 999 (in Saka-Samvat 921 expired) or in A.D. 1000 (in Saka-Samvat 922 expired). 
In A.D. 999 the month of Rishabha lasted from the 23rd April to the 24th May. During that time the 10th tithi of the bright half of the lunar month Vaisakha) commenced 0 h. 53 m. after mean sunrise of Thursday, the 27th April, and ended 1 2.4 m. after mean suurise of Friday, the 28th April ; and the nakshatras on the two days were 
on the Thursday, by the Brahma-siddhånta and according to Garga, Uttara-Phalguni the whole day; and by the equal space system, Pärva-Phalguni up to 9 h. 12 m., and afterwards Uttara-Phalguni ; 
I NO 989 of the Government Epigraphist's collection for 1897. 
Mhe name of the king is lost, but the historical introduction, the whole of which is preserved. makes it certain that the inscription belongs to the time of Rajaraja I,

[Vol. V 
on the Friday, Uttara-Phalguni, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 10 h. 30 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta for 7 h. 13 m.; and afterwards Hasta. 
In A.D. 1000 the month of Rishabha lasted from the 23rd April to the 23rd May; and during that time the 10th lithi of the bright half of the lunar month Tyaishtha) ended 20 h 53 m. after mean sunrise of Wednesday, the 15th May, when the nakshatra was Hasta, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 22 h. 20 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta for 19 h. 3 m., after mean sunrise. 
From this it follows that, if the year of the king's reign is correctly given, either the nakshatra (Hasta) has been quoted incorrectly, or the weekday (Thursday). In A.D. 999 the 10th tithi of the bright half of the month of Rishabha may undoubtedly be joined with Thursday, the 27th April, because the tithi commenced as early as 0 h.53 m. after mean sunrise of that day, but during no part of the Thursday was the moon in the nakshatra Hasta. On the other hand, for A.D. 1000 the day of the date would undoubtedly be the 15th May, when the quakshatra was Hasta ap to nearly the end of the day; but the 15th May A.D. 1000 was & Wednesday, not a Thursday. 
My own opinion is, that the day of the date probably is Thursday, the 27th April A.D. 999, and that the writer, confounding the solar and the lunar months Jyaightha, without verifying his statement, has coupled with that day the nakshatra Hasta, because in the great majority of years' Hasta really is the proper nakshatra for the 10th tithi of the bright balf of the lunar Jyaishtha. 
I may add that I have calculated the date also for the surrounding years A.D. 998 and 1001, as well as for A.D. 1009 and 1010, without any satisfactory results.

* In the 48th year of the reign) of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Kulottunga-Choladova, ta on the day of Satabhishaj, which corresponded to a Friday and to the twelfth tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Kumbha." 
Since, during the month of Kumbha, a twelfth tithi cannot possibly be joined with the pakshatra Satabbishaj, I feel confident that the twelfth is wrongly quoted here instead of the second tithi of the bright half, and that the date, therefore, in every respect is the same as No. 20, above, Vol. IV. p. 262.

I could grote very many similar dates from my lists. 
? A comparison of twelve native calendars for different years has yielded the following regult for the day on which the 10th tithi of the bright balf of the luner Jyrishtha ended : Io nine years the nakshatra was Elasta et the commencement of the day, and in two others towards the end of it; and in the remaining year the nakshatra at the commencement of the day w88 Chitrd, which follows immediately upon Hagta. 
Santa-Ind. Insor. Vol. III, No. 32. 
+ The identity of this king with Kulottunga.Chola I. is proved by the fact that three persons mentioned in this inscription are also referred to in another inscription at Monimangalam (above, Vol. IV. p. 262, No. 20), which openg with the usual historical introduction of the inscriptions of Kulőttunga-Chola I.

"In the 2[9]th year of the reign) of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Kulôttunga-Chöladova, who was pleased to take Madurai, Ilam, and the crowned head of the Pândya--on the day of Mrigasîrsha, which corresponded to a Wednesday and to the seventh tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Mina." 
As the reign of Kulottunga-Chóļa III. commenced between the 5th June and the 8th July A.D. 1178 (above, Vol. IV. p. 266), a date in the month of Mina (February-March) of the 29th year of bis reign will be expected to fall in A.D. 1207 (in Saka-Samyat 1128 expired); and for that year this date is correct. 
In A.D. 1207 the month of Mina lasted from the 23rd February to the 24th March ; and daring that period the seventh tithi of the bright half (of the lunar month Chaitra) ended 20 h. 10 m. after mean sunrise of Wednesday, the 7th March A.D. 1207, when the nakshatra was Mrigaśirsha, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 19 h. 42 m., and by the 
Bruhnia-siddhánta for 18 1. 23 m., afler mean sunrise.

Accordiog to what has beer stated above, a date in the month of Mithuna (May-June) of the 37th year of the king's reign will be expected to fall either in A.D. 1214 (in Saka-Samput 1136 expired) or in A.D. 1215 (in Saka-Samvat 1137 expired). As a matter of fact, this date is correct for A.D. 1215. 
In A.D. 1215 the month of Mithuna lasted from the 27th May to the 26th June; and during that time the 9th title of the bright half (of the lunar month Ashadha) ended 17 h. 17 m. after mean suurise of Sunday, the 7th June A.D. 1215, when the nakshatra was Hasta, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 5 h, 55 m., and by the Brahma-siddhantal for 2 h. 38 m., after nean sunrise. 
The date reduces the period during which the reign of Kulottuga-Chó!a III, must have commenced (by three days, viz.) to the time from (approximately) the 8th June to the 8th July A.D. 1178.

6 miyum Vigala-kilamaiyum perra Svâti-nál. "In the 20th year of the reigro) of the emperor of the three worlds, Kulôttungs Chôľadáva, who was pleased to take Madurai and the crowned head of the Påndya, on the dag of Spati, which corresponded to a Thursday and to the tenth tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Vrishabha," 
From what has been stated above, this date of the month of Rishabha (April-May) of the 20th year of the king's reign would be expected to fall in A.D. 1198 (in Śaka-Samrat 1120 expired) ; but for that year the date is quite incorrect. 
In A.D. 1198 the month of Rishabha lasted from the 25th April to the 25th May, and during that time the 10th bithi of the bright half (of the lunar month Jyuishtha, as a kshaya-tithi) commenced 0h. 43 m. and ended 22 h. 43 m. after mean sunrise of Sunday, the 17th May, when the nakshatras by the equal space system and according to Garga were Uttara-Phalguni and Hasta, and by the Brahma-siddhanta Hasta and Chitril. 
of the many years for which I have calculated the date, only the year A.D. 1200 (the month Rishabha of which would fall in the 22nd year of the king's reign) yields an approxi muately correct result. In that year the tithi of the date ended 7 h.9 m. after mean sunrise of Thursday, the 25th May, which was the last day of the month of Rishabha, and on which the nakshatra was Svâti, by the equal space system and according to Garga from 19 h. 42 m., and by the Brahma-siddhanta from 16 h. 25 n., after mean sunrise. Even this result I cannot regard as satisfactory, because, in my opinion, this Thursday, the 25th May A.D. 1200, would have been described as the day of Chitra.' 
No. 22.-VAKKALERI PLATES OF KIRTIVARMAN II.; 
SAKA-SAMVAT 679. By F. Kielworx, PH.D., LL.D., C.L.E. ; GÖTTINGEN. These plates were first brought to public notice, about twenty years ago, by Mr. L. Rice, C.I.E., who in the Indian Antiquary, Vol. VIII. p. 23 ff., gave the text and a translation of the inscription which they contain, with photolithographs prepared under Dr. Fleet's supervision. The plates were obtained, and are still, at Vakkalêri, the head-quarters of a hóbali in the Kälar district of the Mysore state. My revised text' is based on excellent impressions, furnished to me by Dr. Holtzsch, for whom the original plates were kindly obtained on loan by Mr. Rice. 
These are five copper-plates, the first and last of which are inscribed on one side only, and each of which measures about 92" broad by from 45" (in the middle) to 5" (at the two ends) high. The plates have raised rims and are strong on a ring, which had heen cat already before the impressions were taken. The ring is about 42" in diameter and t" thick, and has its ends secured in the base of an elliptical seal, which measures about 13" by 11" and bears, in relief on a countersunk surface, a standing boar which faces to the proper right The writing is well engraved and is in an excellent state of preservation, so that almost every 
1 It is easy to prove that during the time, which is actually occupied by the tenth tithi of the bright half, the moon cannot possibly be in the nakshatra Svâti during the month of Rishabba. 
A revised text of part of the inscription was given by Dr. Hultzsch, from the published photolithographs, in South Ind. Inscr. Vol. I. p. 146.- Dr. Hultzsch informs me that be cleaned the plates with diluted nitric wid before taking the fresh impressions, from which the accompanying photolithographe have been prepared under Dr, Fleat's sopervision.

single letter may be read with absolute certainty. The characters! balong to the same variety of the sonthorn alphabet which is used, eaqı, in the Togarchéda and Karnal district plates of the Western Chalıkya Vinayaditya, Ind. Ant. Vol. VI. pp. 86 and 89, and Plates. As regards individual letters, the chief point to note is that, except in the oleskara lâ, in which we have the full form of l of the older inscriptions, the letter I is everywhere denoted by the sign which in the earlier Western Chilokya inscriptions, so far as I know, is employed for the subscript l only. For other test-letters, such as kl, j and b, the ordinary earlier types are used throughout. The inscription contains no sign of punctnation, nor any form of a final consonant. The size of the letters is about ...The language of the inscription is Sanskřit, and, with the exception of a well-known verse in praise of the god Vishnu in lines 1 and 2 and three benedictive and imprecatory verses ascribed to Vyása, in lines 72-76, the whole is in prose. From the word śrīmatan in line 2 to djñapayati in line 01 the text forms a single sentence, the construction of which is not always correct, and in which occur two forms which are contrary to the strict rules of grammar. In respect of orthography, it will salice to draw attention to the use of the Dravidian ! in páridrvaja, Il. 20, 27 and 33, and in some proper names the most important of which are Kalabhra, Kerala, Ohôla, and Simhala, and to the fact that visarga before surd gattaral and labial letters has mostly been changed to the jihvůmiliya and spůdhmaniya, and has nearly always been assimilated to a following and s. In general, the text is remarkably free from clerical mistakes. 
The inscription is one of the Western Chalukya Maharajadhiraja Paramébyara Bhattáraka Kirtivarman (II.] Satyasraya, styled Sriprithivīvallabha, the favourite of fortune and the earth,' whose genealogy is given in lines 2-59. It records in lines 61-69) that, when six-hundred and seventy-zine Saka years had gone by, in the eleventh year of his raign, on the full-moon tithi of the month of Bhadrapada, while encamped at the village of Bhandaragavittage on the northern bank of the river Bhimarathi, the king, at the request of a certain Dôkirája, granted the village of Sulliyûr, together with Nengiyûr and Nandivalli, situated in the midst of the villages Tâmaramuge, Pánungal, Kiruvalli and Balapuru, on the southern bank of the river Aradore, in the Pånungal-vishaya, to Madhavašarman, the son of Krishnašarman and son's son of the student of the Rig- and Yajurvēdas Vishņuśarman, of the Kåmakâyana gôtra. The charter (according to lines 76 and 77) was written by the Mahasiindhovigrahika Anivärita Dhapamjaya, styled Punyavallabha, 'the favourite of religious marit.' 
The date does not admit of verification ; for Saka-Samvat 679 expired it would correspond to the 2nd September A.D. 757. Of the localities mentioned, Bhandaragavittage, according to Dr, Fleet, must be' Bhandar-Kawte' in the Sholậpur districtmathe 'Kowteh' of the map On a stream which flows into the Sîna, which again flows into the Bhima (the Bhimarathi of the inscription); Pangngal is the modern Kångal in the Dhâwâr district, and Båļavuru seems to be the modern Bilûr, three miles south by east of Hângal; the other places have now disappeared. 
See Prof. Bühler's Indische Palæographie, Plate VII. col. xvi. The sigo No. 12, given there Bs sika, is really tư; and the sign No. 19 is tga, not dga. Under No. 2, the sign for d is omitted (see 1. 37 of the inscription); on the other hand, the form of pha, given under No. 28, does uot occur in the inscription. 
Compare, e.g., the subscript l of the akshara lla of the word vallabhdna in the last line of the Togarchedu plates, Ind. ant. Vol. VI. p. 87. This sign for l differs from the sign for which is used throughout in the Naushri plates of the Gujarat Chalukya Yuparája Srgåśraya Siladitya, and very frequently in the Surat plates of the gama; gee Jour.

Of lines 1-59 of the inscription, which contain the genealogy of the donor, commencing with Polekêši-vallabha (Pulikêšin I.), it would be superfinous to give a translation or even an abstract of the contents.

There is the same uncertainty about the actual reading in the three Nerüc plates. Above, Vol. IV. p. 343, I. 50, the reading appears to be pada (not pada). In the Lakshmeávar inscription noticed by Dr. Fleet in Ind. Ant. Pol. VII. p. 112, the reading distinctly is, in the first part, potodlalkd, and in the second, padadhakka. Mr. Kittels Kannada-English Dictionary givos padadakke and padadakke in the sense of '& kettle-drum.' Above, Vol. IV. p. 305, 1. 26, and elsewhere, we have pålikdtana-pratidkalkd.

No. 28 MINDIGAL INSCRIPTION OF RAJADHIRAJA; 
SAKA-SAMVAT 970. 
By H. KRISHNA SASTRI, B.A. Mindigal is a village abont eleven miles north-west of Chintamani, the head-quarters of the Chintamani täluka of the Kõlir district in the Mysore State. The older form of the name, Miadungallu, occurs in line 9 of the inscription, which also states that the village belonged to the district of Koyyakoro-nâļu. 
The subjoined record was first brought to my notice by a goldemith of Mindigal, who gont me for examination a pencil-sketch of the writing on the stone, expecting some hidden treasure to be referred to therein. It was, however, found out to be an important inscription of the Chola king Rajadhirâja, dated both in the Saka era and in a year of his reign, and I was at once deputed by Dr. Hultzsch to prepare inked estampages of the stone, from which I now edit the inscription. The slab on which the inscription is written measures 5' by 4'9" and is fixed into the platform of the Sômésvara temple in the fields to the north-east of Mindigal. At the top, to the proper right of lines 1 and 2, are engraved the figures of a cow and a calf. The characters are of the old Kanarese type and are neatly engraved between horizontal lines. The language of the inscription is throughout Kanarese, with the exception of the Tamil words kõv=Irájakésaripadmar=dna udeyâr in l. 3, and yandu in 1. 4. 
As regards the orthography of the inscription, I have to make the following remarks : (1) Except in the case of d, the secondary forms of long vowels do not differ from those for the corresponding short ones. (2) The anusvára is represented by a small dot, which is placed at the right apper corner of the letter to which it belongs. The same symbolis used in l. I for the cypher, as in other Kanarese and Telugu inscriptions. (3) The superscribed form of r does not occur in the inscription; and where such a form is required, it is indicated by the doubling of the consonant to which it was meant to be profixed. (4) The anusvára takes the place of other nasals before ga (ul. 9 and 13), gha (1. 5), da (1. 5) and pa (1. 8). (5) The viráma is

[Vol. V. 
UU 
tepregented, as in modorn Kanarese and Telugu, by a zigzag line attached to the talekattu, (6) Tho consonants ra and ra, la and la are used in their proper places, except in the cases of alivan for alivan (1.11) and golurgaia for golagam (1, 14). 
In galdeyuran (1. 15 f.) and Bårardsiyuvan (1. 17) the accusative termination is, in strict accordanoo with the rulos of grammar, affixed only to the last of the nouns which are the objects of the same verb, while the others remain in the nominative case combined with the copulative conjunction un; but in Saleyu[in*] (1. 3) the accusative termination is omitted, The word samvatsaradal (1,1 f.), which ought to stand after nuvettareya (1. 4), has been misplaced. 
The inscription records the gift of some land and of an oil-mill to the temple of Sômêsvara at Mindungallu by the Dandanayaka Appimayya, surnamed Rajendra-Chóla Brahmamâraya (11. 4 ff. and 11 f.), who governed the Mårâjavâ di Seven-thousand country from his camp at Vallûru. This grant was made when a certain Bairayya, surnamed Rajendra-Chola-Pompalamâraya, the son of Muddarase of Muruganaiale (1. 7 ff.), had ropaired the temple of Sômêśvara. The land granted was irrigated by two tanks,-- Pallavakattu (11. 9 and 12) and Badagana-Pompalakattu (1. 13 f.), the first of which had been built by Bairayya and the second by Appimayya. 
The record is dated in the Saka year 970, which corresponded to the current Sarvajit-sari vatsara and to the thirtieth year of the reign of the Chola king) Rajakesarivarman, alias Bajadhirajadêva, who took the bead of the glorious Virapândya and the sale of the Chêrk king. This date corresponds to A.D. 1047-48% and has enabled Professor Kielhorn to calculate the dates of four other inscriptious of the same king and to show that his reign commenced betweon the 15th March and the 3rd December A.D. 1018, 1.e. during the reign of his predecessor Rajendra-Chola I. whose reign extended from A.D. 1011-12 to at least A.D. 1033. Consequently Rajadhiraja must have been the co-regent of Rajendra-Chola I. and did not rule independently before the death of the other. The birudas of the chiefs Appimayya and Bairayya, viz. Rajendra-Chőļa-Bral.namarêya and Rajendra Chôle-Pômpalamiraya, were evidently acquired by them during the reign of Râjâdhiraja's predecessor Rajendra-Chola I. The conquests of Rajadhiraja are described in detail in an inscription of his 29th year at Manimangalam. One of his achievements is stated to have been that he routed the Chêra king and followed the example of his ancestor Råjarâja I. in destroying the ships at Kandalur-Salai. This is the incident alluded to by the biruda. Seramanu Salequin*1 Konda,' which is given to Rajadhiraja in L 2 f. of the subjoined inscription The taking of the head of Vicapândya' is not mentioned in the historical introduction of the flaşimangalam inscription, which refers to three other Påndya enemies of Râjâdhiraja, 
Of the proper names contained in this inscription the following admit of identification. The Märajavadi Seven-thousand province" (1. 6), over which Appimayya ruled, is mentioned in other inscriptions as Mahârâjapädi, Marayapåđi and Märjavida-râjya, and Vallûru (1. 6f.), the residence of Appimayya, has been identified with a village of the same name, about 8 miles porth-west of Cuddapah7 Muruganamale (1.7) is identical with Murugamale, a village near Chintamani. The first of the two tanks mentioned in the inscription, viz. Pallavakattu, appears to have been situated near the Sômêsvara temple (11. 9-12). The ruins of it still exist A few yards to the east of the same temple. 
1 Ton the Pompala family compare above, p. 171, nota 1.-E. H.) % Compare above, Vol. IV. p. 216. 
See ibid. p. 218. 4 [This will be shown by Prof. Kielhorn under the Chola date No. 34.-E. H) 
South-Ind. Inscr. Vol. III. p. 52. 
Sale is the Kanarese equivalent of Salai, i.e. Kdodaļdz-śllai. 
y South Ind. Inson. Vol. III. p. 106. In his Epigraphia Carnatica, Vol. IV. Introduction, P, 20, Wr. Rice mentions Vollir as being situated to the north-east of Mysore and described as the capital of the Riwarajaridi Seven-tbousand." This name is perhaps A mistake for Mabdrájavadi.

No. 24DAULATPURA PLATE OF BHOJADEVA I. OF MAHODAYA; 
(HARSHA-]SAMVAT 100. 
By F. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E., GÖTTINGEN. This plate is said to have been found, some thirty years ago, among the ruins of an ancient temple near the village of Siva, the Sewa' of the map, about 7 miles E.N.E. of tảe town of Didwana ia Jodhpur (Marwad), Rajputâna, Indian Atlas, quarter-sheet No. 33 N.E., long. 74° 44' E., lat. 27° 27' N. It was taken at the time to the small fortress of Daulatpura, about 4 miles E.S.E. of Didwana, but since September 1897 has been deposited in the Historical Records Office at Jôdhpur. I edit the inscription which it contains from impressions, which were kindly furnished to Dr. Hultzsch by Muusiff Debiprasad of Jodhpur and by Dr. Führer. 
This is a single plate, inscribed on one side only. It is very similar to the Dighwa-Dabanli plate of Mahendrapala and the Bengal As. Soc.'s plate of Vinayakapala, published by Dr. Fleet, with photolithographs, in Ind. Ant. Vol. XV. p. 105 ff, and p. 138 ff. The plate is about 1'94" broad by 1' 41' high, and on to its proper right side is soldered & heavy brass seal, about 6** broad by 9" high, the top of which is raised into an arched peak. The letters of the legend on the seal are in relief, and the arch contains a standing figure which is only faintly visible in the impressions. The writing on both the plate and the seal is well executed, and in an excellent state of preservation. The size of the letters on the plate is between " and t", and on the seal, between t" and ". The characters belong to the northern class of alphabets, and are similar to, but in some particularså more antique than, those of the two plates mentioned above. They include, in line 16 of the plate, numerical symbols for 100 and 10, and the numeral figure for 3. The language of the inscription is Sanskrit, and, with the exception of one verse in lines 15 and 16, the text is in proge. In respect of orthography, I may note the use of the sign for v, to denote b; the constant doubling of t before r; the employment of instead of anusvúra in the word ansce, in lines 10 and 14 of the plate ; the use of parambha. gavatibhakto in lines 4 and 65 of the plate, and of parambhagavatibhakto in lines 5 and 10 of the seal, for paramabhagavatibhaktô; and the occurrence of the term samvatsro, for samvatsarah or the ordinary samvat, in the date, in line 16. 
The inscription is one of a Maharaja Bhôjadêva, who, from his residence or camp of Mahodaya, on the representation of one of the people concerned, renews here a grant which had been made by his great-grandfather, the Maharaja Vatsarajadeva, and continued by his grandfather, the Mahúrája Nagabhatadeva, but, in his own reign, had fallen into abeyance. The object of the grant is the village of Sivå, in the Pêņdvånaka-vishaye of the Gurjaratri 
Vizo his sovereign, the Chöļa king Rajadbirkja. 
* I.e. Vlråpasi (Benares). ' I refer especially to the different forms of the consonants and t; of the subscript & in the akaharer pu, yu and su; and of the medial & (ai, d, and au). 
For other northern inscriptions which exhibit both numerical symbols and numeral figures, see my List of Northern Inscriptions, Nob. 528 (which is about 78 years older than the present inscription), 541, 560, 602, 6!6, 657, *od 655. 
In line 6 the engriver has actually engraved paranbhdgao. * See my List, Yos. 542 (where the actual reading also appears to be tamratard), 544, and 545.

The genealogy. of Bhôjadêva, which is given on both the plate and the sea!, was known already from the Dighwa.Dubaali and Bengal As. Soc.'s plates mentioned above. The Dighwa-Dubanli plato, which is dated 55 years later, records a grant of his son Mahendra påls; and from the Bongal As. Soc.'s plate we know that Mahendrapala's son and successor Fag another Bhôjadêva (or Bhôjadêya II.), who in turn was sticceeded by Vinayakapala, his brother from a different mother. All the three grants were issued from the skandhavūra (i.c. either a camp or royal residencal) at Mahodaya. As was first pointed out by Dr. F. E. Hall, Mahôdaya or Mahôdayâ, according to the lexicographers, is another name of Kanyakubja (Kanyakubja, or Kanuuj), and there is no rouson now why that identification should not be accepted bere. So long us only the two other grants were available, which refer to localities about 250 miles south-east and 150 miles east by north of Kanauj, it could well be doubted whether the government of these Mahúrájas had extended 60 far west as to inolude Kanauj; but We now see from the present inscription that these princos held sway even over a part of the country which is more than 300 miles west of Kanadj, and for the three grants together it 'would be dificult to find a place of inne more favourably situated than that well-known city, 
Our inscription indicates the solution of another difficulty presented by the other grants. The plate of Mahendrapala, in line 14, contains the half-verse Srimad-Bhüka-prayuktasya fåsandeya sthir-dyaték, and Vinkyakapkla’s plate, in line 16, has the similar half-yerse Sri Harshéna prayuktasya śâsanasya sthir-ayatéh. To make some sense of these incomplete sentences Dr. Fleet bad to supply the words this is the writing of ;' but now a different explanation is furnished to us. Instead of the half-verse we here, in lines 15 and 16, have the fall terse Prabháséna prayuktasya śásanasya sthir-uyatéh śrímán=Nagabhatô namna yuvarájó=tra dútakaḥ. This verse makes it clear, that the half-verge of the other grants also is part of a customary verse, the object of which was to record, in the second half, the name of the dútaka ; and that, through the force of habit (and perhaps for a reason which will appear below), the half-verse was inserted even when no dútaka was to be mentioned. The exact interpretation of the details of the verse solely depends on the sense of the word prayuktasya. In my opinion, the meaning which at once suggests itself for sásanan prayuj, is, to employ a command for a certain purpose, to address an order to somebody, to proclaim an ediot, to issue a charter, and Prabhdsena prayuktar sesanan, therefore, could hardly be anything else than Prabhasasya sasanan, “sn order or charter of Prabhasa," which, in the case of the present inscription, of course would mean of Bhỏjadêva.' In accordance with this interpretation I take the three names, Prabhasa, Bhaka and Harsha, to be second names of the three Yahardjas who issued the respective grants; and I suspect that in the grants of

Mahendra påla and Vinayakapåla the by themselves meaningless half-verses, to some extent, were inserted for the very purpose of recording those second names of the donors. With the full verse of the present inscription I would compare the concluding verse of the Achyutapuram and Parla-Kimeņi plates of the Gånga Mahúrája Indravarman, in which also the second dame of that prince, Râjasi mn hat, is mentioned, as it were incidentally, only in connection with the writing of the grants. 
The localities mentioned in this inscription admit of easy identification. The village of Sivå of course is the very place near which the plate was found, and the name of the Dandvånaka-vishaya suvites in that of the town of Didwâna which is about 7 miles W. $. W. of Sivå. The Dêndvånaka-vishaya is stated to have been in the Gurjaratrå-bhůmi. I have not been able to trace the name Gurjaratra in any of the published records ;' but I find the term Gurjaratrů-mandala, denoting the same part of the country (and 110 doubt synonymous with Gurjaratra-bluümi), in an unpublished inscription of about the 8th century at Kâlañjar,$ That inscription speaks of a man who had gone forth from Mangalânaka, situated in the Gurjaratrâ-mandalag and Mangalûnaka- clearly is the -Maglona' of the map, which is only about 28 miles N, N. E. of Didwina. 
The date of the inscription, like the dates of the two cognate grants, must be referred to the Harsha era. It does not admit of verification, but, judging by the date of Mahendrapala's plate, it would probably correspond to the 2nd March A,D. 706. 
The Mahdrája Bhöjadêya I. of our inscription was preceded by his father, the Maharaja Råmabhadradêva, and succeeded by his son, the Mahāraja Mahendrapaladeva. The same Dames we find again, in the same order, in the list of the later Mahârájádhirajas of Kanauj. According to the Peheyâ (Pehoa) inscription of (Harsha-] Samvat 276, No. 546 of my List, the Maharajadhiraja Bhôjadêva was the successor of the Maharajadhiraja Råmabhadradêva; and according to the Siyađôņi inscription, ibid. Nos. 18 and 20, Bhöjadêya was succeeded by the Makärájádhiraja Mahendrapaladére. This alone would go far to prove that the later Mahärájádhírájas were descendants of the earlier Mahárdjas. But in addition to this, like the Maharājas the Mahărâjâdhirdjas also, in the Siyađôņi inscription, apparently are referred to as ruling at Mahôdayân as their capital; and so far as we can judge from the known inscriptions, the extent and situation of their respective dominions, at least from the west to the east, were about the same. On the west, we have seen above, the plate of the Mahúrája Bhojadêva I. takes us to Didwâna in" Mârwåd; and on the east, the plate of his grandson, the Maharaja Vinayakapāla, records the grant of a village near Benares. The direct distance from Didwâna to Benares is about 540 miles; and from between the two places, and not far from a straight

village of Siyâ, which belongs to the Deadvånaka vishaya in the Gurjaratrâ country (bhiimi): 
(L. 8.) The Bhatta Harshuka has apprised (vs) that the above-written agrahúra, with every income from it excepting previous gifts to gods and Brahmans, by means of a charter was granted by our creat-grandfather, the Mahúrája Vatsarajadhva, for as long as the moon, the san and the earth endure, to his grandfather, the Bhatta Vaandēta, and was possessed (by the latter), and that by him (the Bhatta Vasudeva) the sixth part of it was given by a deed of donation to the Bhatta Vishnu ; that our grandfather, the Mahardja Nagabhatadêva, signified his consent; but that, in our own reign, that charter and consent have fallen into abeyance.

No. 25.- INSCRIPTIONS AT ABLUR. 
Br J. F. FLEET, PA.D., C.I.E. Ablûr is a village about two miles to the west of Köd, the chief town of the Kôd tâlnka of the Dhårwir district. Its name occurs in the ancient records in the fuller form of Abbalûr or Abbalûru; and the record B. places it in the Nâgarakhanda seventy, which was a subdivision of the Bankväsi twelve-thousand province (see below). Ink-impressions of seven inscriptions were obtained for me at this village. The most important of the inscrip tions is E., the record which gives the history of the revival of Saivism in the twelfth centary A.D. This will be edited in full ; 80 also F., a short record connected with it, and G., which is interesting as being a virgal or monumental tablet, belonging to a class of records of which not many specimens have as yet been made fully avilable. The other records all present points of interest : but they are not important enough to repay the time and trouble that would be required to edit them in full; and it will be suficient to give abstracts of the contents of them. 
A. and B. Of the time of Vikramaditya VI.-A.D. 1104. These are duplicate copies, almost word for word the same, but not absolutely so, of a record at & temple of Siva which is now known as the temple of Basavešvara, though, as the records themselves shew, it was originally called the temple of Brahmêsvara? because it was founded by a Gávunda or village-headman named Bamna or Barma, i.e. Brabma A. is on a stone tablet outside the temple; and B. is on a stone tablet inside it. 
The text of the sel] is identical with part of the text of the plate. 
Brahmdicara-dévara dégula, e.g., A. line 62 ; and Brahméivara.d&vata sthana, 6.9., C. line 27.- The founding of it is mentioned in A. lines 27, 28.

In A., the writing, consisting of eighty-five lines of about seventy letters each, covers an ares about #l" broad by 6'5" high: it is in a state of very good preservation as far as line 70: from there it has suffered a good deal of damage, but the illegible portions can almost all be supplied from B. In B., the writing, consisting of ninety-one lines of about sixty-five letters each, covers an area about 4' 1" broad by 6' 10" high: at about one-third from the proper right side, the tablet is broken into two pieces from top to bottom; but no entire letters are destroyed along the line of fissure: in other respects, it is in a state of very good preservation, except for a few places in lines 79 to 91, where, however, the illegible pagsages can almost all be supplied from 4.-- In both cases, the sculptures at the top of the stone are, in the centre, a linga, with an officiating priest, inside a shrine; on the proper right side, towards the top, the sun, and, in the lower part, a standing figure inside a shrine, with the bull Nandi near the edge of the stone; and on the proper left side, towards the top, the moon, and, in the lower part, another standing figure inside a shrine, with a cow and calf near the edge of the stone.--The characters are Kanarese, of the regular type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well formed and well executed throughout. The size of the letters ranges, in A. from about 
" to ", and in B. from about s" to . The second part of the record, commencing in A. line 72 and B. line 77, was engraved by the Püvâri Honnēja or Hoạnôja ; and the first part was engraved by the same person in conjunction with the Rúvári Sóroja: the writers or composers of the two parts were different people: bat, on each stone, the execution is so uniform through out that, in each case, the whole record must have been put on the stone at one and the same time, at or soon after the second date, in A.D. 1104, which must, therefore, be considered the proper date of the record. Except for the opening invocation of Siva, repeated in A. line 72 f. and B. line 77 f., and for the verse which follows it in the first instance, and for one imprecatory Terse in 4. line 71 f. and B. line 76, the language is Kanarese; partly in verse, and partly in prose. In addition to rúvári, an engraver,' the record gives us another word, khandarisu (A. line 85, B. lines 77, 90), evidently meaning to engrape," which is not found in Mr. Kittel's Kannada-English Dictionary, and dhali (A. line 6, B. line 7) as a variant of dáli, 'attack, incarsion, invasion,' gûvunda (e.g., A. line 19) as a variant of gauda, gayuda, a village headman (the Marathi pútil), and bhanasu (A. line 75, B. line 80) as a variant of banasa, bûnast,' kitchen:' it also gives, in A. line 6, B. line 7, kutkila, a mountain ;' Kittel's Dictionary includes this word; bat Monier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary seems to give only the form hakila 
The whole inscription is a record of the time of the Western Châlukya king Vikramaditya VI. It is a Saiva record. And it registers grants that were made in his twenty-sixth year, in A.D. 1101, and in his twenty-ninth year, in A.D. 1104. On the first occasion, when the Dandanayaka Gôvindarasa was ruling the districts known as the Hânumgal five-hundred, the Basavura hundred-and-forty, and the Någarakhanda seventy, he came in state to Abbalůr, and saw the temple of the god Brahméśvara which Bammagâyunda had caused to be built there, and was pleased ; and, at the request of Bammagåruņda's son chagávunda, he granted to the temple a village named Muriganahaļļi$ in the Någarakhanda soventy.

Though Kittel's Dictionary does not include rüpári, it gives rivu, as well as riput, as a tadbhaod corruption of riya, 
So, also, C, line 52 gives khandarane, evidently in the sense of 'engraving.'

This record does not mention anyone, with reference to wbom it could be taken in the latter sease in the case of the Govindardja of the first passave.

may be remarked, in passing, that the allotment to the Govindaraga of the second passage of so high a rank as that of Mahasamantadhipati, is undoubtedly incorrect, whoever he may have been; just as much as in line 4 the record makes & mistake in describing Anantapala as merely a Mahasamanta, inatoad of a Mahasdmantadhipati. 
The Gôvindarasa of the third passage, however,--though the special biruda does not occur in it, being described as having a much more extensive authority, is most probably another person, to be distinguished by the full name of Raņarangabhairava-Gôvindarasa, who was apparently & paternal unole of the Govindaraja of the first passage, and regarding whom we learn the following facts from records at Balagámi and Talgund. He belonged to the Parâsara gôtra, and was the son of Dâsirâja, son of Kesiraja and Nilabbe, and of sôrala dêyi or Sômámbike (e.g., the records of A. D. 1102, line 24 f., and A.D. 1114, line 37 f.). The record of A.D. 1102 styles him (line 44) Krishnarấj-ánuja, " the younger brother of Krishnaraja," with reference, doubtless, to the Krishnaraja of the Ablûr inscription ; and the record of A.D. 1112 styles him (line 37) annan=unkakdra, " the champion of his elder brother," and Krishnarijan=anugina-tamna, " the affectionate (or beloved) younger brother of Krishnaraja." The record of A.D. 1114 further describes him as Ldt-ánvaya-laláfa-mandala tilaka, which expression, taking lalafamandala as meaning much the same thing as lalásapatta, we may render by " a forehead-mark of the broad forehead that was the lineage of the Lâțas : " 80, also, the record of A.D. 1102 describes Anantapála (in line 8) as Lâta-kula kumudavana-vidhu-kara, " & very ray of the moon to (open) the cluster of water-lilies (flowering at night) that was the family of the Latas : " evidently, both the persons traced their origin to ancestors who were natives of the Lata country ; and this, no doubt, accounts in part for the intermarriage and the special favour -bewn by Anantapála to Rañarangabhairava-Gôvindarasa. His biruda of Raņarangabhairava, "a very Bhairava (Siva) in the field of battle," ligures more or less prominently in all the records. And the record of A.D. 1114 styles him (line 40) Tribhuvanamalladéva-vijaya-dakshina-bhuja-danda, “the staff of the pictorions right arm of Tribhuyanamalladéva-(Vikramâditya VI.)." In A.D. 1102, the Dandandyaka Anantapkla, the Mahûsâmantadhipati who had attained the pañchamahatabda, was "protecting, with the delight

The record of A.D. 1112 introduces a new official superior of Ranara ngnbhairaya-Govindaraja : it tells us that, under Vikramaditya VI., the Påndya Mahlmandalesvara Tribhuvanamalla-Kâmarasa, "the lord of Gôkarna the best of towns," — who belonged to the line of the Pâədya rulers of Sisugali, the capital of the Haive division of the Końkaņ,- Tas "ruling with the delight of an agreeable or friendly interchange of communications (with his paramount sovereign);" that Anantapala gave bim the Vanapasi country;a that, on receipt of it, he made appointments ; and that, by appointment from him, Raņarangabhairava-Govinda, mentioned further on in the record as the Dandálhistara Govinda, was "protecting" the Banayage country.

The word jiju, gambling, seems to be used here, to suit the convenience of the composer of the verge, instead of jujugara, 'a gambler." 
The ide& evidently is, that Govinda cut off the heads of the Malapas and used, them as lice. And a Kanarieg kallad somewhat similarly describes a Governor of Bombny as proposing to cut off the beads of Holkar and Scindia and play the game of juggling balls with them before the Peshiva Bajirao,

At the same time, we do not yet knorr of any Saivat writer named Akalanka; and Sôincsrara can hardly have given encouragement to the writings of the Jain Akaladka, oveu in the department of tarka or logic with which the name of that Akaladka is sometimes specially connected (eg, in line 45 of a Jain record of A.D. 1077 at Balagani, P.

From line 65 of the Ablar inscription, we learn that someśvara Was a follower of Lnkuļika; and (see page 227 below) Lakuļist was an opponent of the LOkârates, MimâMalkas, and Sarokhyam. There are, perlaps, some liidden second meanings, which I've failed to see. Kujdta, for instance, may mean "base-born, as well as tree;" but the alternative reading mahtja is opposed to that.

We gather & good deal of information about the Mûvaraköņeyasentati from varione records at Balagåmi.3 And, in the first place, we find that it was connected with the sect of the Kalamukhas, which is already fairly well known. We learn this from the record of A.D. 1112, which says (line 49)- Parvvat-emnâyada Md vara-kôņeya-santânada Sakti parisheyo!-nega!te-fadedu sishya-châtake-varshåkåla-mukharzenisida Kålamukharol, -- "among

the Kalamukbas, who, having attained fame in the Saktiparishe of the Mûvarakôņeyadamtâna of the Parvatâmnaya, had caused themselyes to be spoken of as the very burst of the rainy season for the chdtaka-birds that are disciples," -- and then goes on to place among these "Kâlamukhas" Kédårasakti, his son Srikantha, and Srikantha's son Sômésvara. This passage would, indeed, seem to identify the Kålåmukhas with the Múvaraköpeyasamtati. But this appears not quite consistent with the fact that the college (sthana) of the Kalâmukhas of the ancient Balligáve was the temple of Panchalinga, whereas the college of the Mûvarakóņeyasamtati was a different building. And it seems probable that what the passage really means, is, that the founder of the Mûyaraköņeyasamtati was a member of the Kålåmukha sect who established some particular school, the tenets of which differed in some respects from the general doctrine of the Kålåmukhas. The verse Dharegreseva, etc., Beems to name, as the order of development, first the Saktiparsbe, then the Parpatâvali, and then the Müvaraköņeyasamtati. On the other hand, the proge passage, just quoted, indicates first the Parvatávali, then the Mûvarakoneyasamtati, and then the Saktiparshe. The verse used in the record of A.D. 1129 (see page 223 below), and in some subsequent records, does not mention the Saktiparsbe, and indicates first the Paryatåpeli and then the Møvaraköneyagaritati, And the record of A.D. 1192 mentions only the Parvatávali. 
The members of the Mayarakóneyasantati were the hereditary priests of the temple of the god Siva in the form of Dakshina-Kâdåreśvara, “the Kedaresvara of the South, which, as we learn from line 57 of the record of A.D. 1112, was on the Sri or raised bank of a tank called Tåvaregero and Tåvareyakere," the tank of water-lilies," which was in the southern part of the lands of Balligåve. They had also the temple of Siva in the form of Nagarèsvara or Nakharêśvara, which, again,- 28 we areas told in line 26 of the record of A.D. 1094... Was at the Tåvaregere tank. And, from A.D. 1139 onwards (see page 224 f. below), they had also a temple of Siva in the form of Kusuvestama, which was then built in connection with the temple of Dakshiņa-Kedårêsvara. Their matha or college is sometimes spoken of as the Kadaramatha and the Kedårasthane. But its actual name was, in Kanarese, Kodiya matha, which appears in & Sanskrit passage as Köțimatha. From line 60 f. of & record of 
1 In every other passage known to me, this name is spelt with the long d in the second syllable. The short a is used here probably only in connection with the play on the meaning of the components, or supposed companente, of the name. The word kilamukha appear to denoto'kind of monkey,' and also to be another name of the kdldguri or black aguru-tree. 
See page 227 below, and note 1. 
* It may be mentioned, incidentally, that another record at Balagámi, of A.D, 1098 (*ee page 223 below, note 8), discloses, in line 34, the name of another parishad at the ancient Ballig&ve, nit, the Süleyaparsbe.

Dakshina-Kedaresvars was an image established at Balligive as the southern representative of Siya au worabipped at Kedarnath in the north, a famous temple and place of pilgrimage in the Garhwal district, Nortb. West Province, situated, according to Thornton's Gazetteer, in lat. 80° 44', long 799 , in the Himllayan, and standing 11755 feet above the level of the sea. From the titlings of the transcriptions in Sir Walter Elliot's Carmátaka-Déra Inscriptions, of some of the recorde mentioned in note 8 on page 820 above, it appears that the temple of Dakshina Kedirébrara is now known as the temple of Bagavad 
The name appears au Nakbargsvare in the record of A.D. 1004. Blsewhere, it is usually written Nugarefrard, which, 10 doubt, was the real correct form. Its name is explained in a publage in line 48# of the rocord of A.D. 1129, which rund, - Balligaveyol-dakshina-dil-tata-wikafadartti mandita-pundartka-tand Audutam-um=alli nagara-janaingal=dxjjisidedganya-punya-punjamu Sida-bhacamat-dd-onto Nagardiraram emini perar-padod# sogayisutlam-irppuda."A Balligave, close to the southern boundary, there in 811 ornamental gerden update seems to be used bore for upaosna] full of water-lilles; and there there stande, in all its beauty, the temple named Nagardkvara, the veritable abode of Siva, (an embodiment) indeed (Of) all the incalculable religioon perit amassed by the people of the town. 
This, which seems to be only • Sanskritised form, is taken from line 19 of the record of A.D. 1815. In the pbotographs of some of the records, the vowel of the first syllable might be taken to be d, instead of d. But the name appeare very distinotly Kodiyamaths, in line 61 of the record of A.D. 1158 (800 page 829 below. non 1).

A D. 1158, which speaks of " Vámasaktipanditadeva, the Åcharya of the Kodiyamatha of the Hergada Vennamarasa of that place (Balligáve)," it seems to have been built for the members of the line by the said Venpaparask. And it would appear that it was named the Kódiga. matha because, probably, it stood somewhere near the kôdi or outlet of the Tåvaregere tank, That the Kôdiyamatha was the matha of the Mûvarakónegasamtati, we learn explicitly from the record of A.D. 1162, which mentions, as belonging to the succession of the family of the Gurus of the Ködliyamatha," two persons, Gautama and the Vámasakti mentioned above, who, 23 will be seen, were disciple-descendants of Kêdůraśakti. And the same record father gives (line 27 ff.) the following rather singular description of the matha - Dakshiņa-Kidkra athanamum Siva-linga-půjâ. pulaka-susya-sarasa-kêdârasthânamum naishțhika-brahmacharyya Śiva-munijan-ânushthana nishthita-sthånamun sånga Rig-Yajus-Sâm-Atharvva-chaturvyłda Svadhyâya-sthậnamın Kaumara-Påņinîya-Sakatayana-Sahdånusdsan-adi-b yâ(vyá)karana byâ (vyâ ;khyana-sthầnaman nykya-vaiseshika-mimamså-samkhya-baudhdh(ddb) - å di-shadu darsana-bydi vyà khyâna-sthi namun Lákulasidhdhi(ddhamta-Pitanja!-edi-y ôgas üstra tyd(vyá) khảna-sthâniamam ashtâdaśapuriņa-dharmmasastra-sakala-kê by&(vya)- n å ta ka - nâ tik-adi-vividba-vidya-sthanamın dîn-ånàtha-pamgy-andha-badhira-katha ka-gayaka Fådaka-ramsika-narttaka-vaitålika-nagna-bhagua-kahapanak-aikadamại-trid a ṁ di-han88 - Maratnahang-tai-nan-dosa-bikshukajall-niyaryy-[i*7mmadẫna-shấnaman nân- a n đ t à a - rügijana-ródha-bhaishajra-sthinamun sakala-bhût-abhaya-pradana-sthånamum=agi Kodiya mathav-ilppndu, namely, " there is tha Kôdiyamatha, which has become the abode of the god Kedåra of the South-a very field charming with a crop which is the standing erect of the hairs of the body that is indnced by doing worship to the linga of Siva--a place devoted to the observances of Saiva saints a learling prpetually the life of celibate religious students. ---- a place for the q aict study of the four Vēdas, the Rich, Yajus, Saman, and Atharran, together with thcir auxiliary works -- a place where commentaries are composed on the Kaumitra, Pininiyu, Sukatayana, Sabu.isuusasard, and other grammatical works.--a place where conmentaries are composed on the six systems of philosophy, namely the Nydya, Vaiséshika, Mimamsa, Sankhya, Bauddha, etc... a place where commentaries are composed on the

The founder of the Mûvara kôņeyasantati appears to have been Ködärašakti; at any rate, we have obtained no earlier name at present. ' For him, we have as yet no date. 
The son and chief disciple of Kédérasakti, and evidently his successor as head of the matha, was Śr dantha. The record of A.D. 1094 names him as his chief disciple (line 21); and the record of A.D. 1112 names him as his son (line 50). In the record of A.D. 1094, after the verse Dhureg=eseua, etc., there is used (line 21 f.), to describe Srikantha, a verse which we can now render more correctly, as follows.-- Å * munipan=agra-sishyar śrímat Srikantha

For Srikantha, agrin, we have as yet no date. 
The son and disciple, and evidently the saccessor, of Srikantha was Sômêsvara. The record of A.D. 1094 names him as his disciple (line 22); and the record of A.D. 1112 names him as his son (line 52). In A.D. 1094,3 he was the Acharya of the god Nakharésvara ; and his feet were then Javed by the assembly of the Pattanasvamin and other representatives of the people of the town, on the occasion of making a grant to that god. In A.D. 1101, as we learn from the Ablir inscription A., he was at Ablür, and his feet were laved by the Dandanayaka Govindarasi, on the occasion of making a grant to the god Brahmêsvara of that village. The record of A.D. 1102 describes him (line 49) as the Acharya of the sthârc of the god Dakshina Kedårðśvara, and tells us that his feet were then laved by the Dandanayaka Rañarangabhairava Gôyindarasa, in making a grant to that god. And in A.D. 1112 his feet were laved by the Påndya Mahúmandalésvara Tribhuvanamalla-Kâmaddvarasa, when another grant was made to the same god. This last record describes Sômeśvara, in line 34, as the Årådhya or family-priest of Kåmadêvarasa. 
The record of A.D. 1129 opens the account of these teachers with a new verse, which runs (line 58 f.)— Müvarab-köneya-samtati-dôvabra(vra)tan-eseva Parvyat-êval iyo!=tâ n = @virbhbha(bbha)visidan=anala-yasô-vibhu Kedårašakti-pandita-deya[**], "in the famous Parvatávali there was born Kèdârasaktipaņaitadêve himself, the lord of pure fame, a devotee of the gods in the Mûvaraköņeyasamtati." It mentions Srikantha as the disciple of Kėdarasakti, and 8ômêsvarâryya as the disciple of Srikantha. After Sômêśvara there came, it tells us, his younger brother Vidyabharana. But he, it says, did not care for any occupation except the steady pursuit of knowledge; and so he transferred all the business affairs of the matha to his own chief disciple Vâmasakti. In A.D. 1129, however, when the grant registered in this record was made,-- namely, the allotment of a village for the repairs and other purposes of the matha -- it was Vidyabharana who was gummoned (line 69), and whose feet were leved, by the Western Chålukya king Sômêsvaru III., who had theu come south to make a state progress through his dominions and was encamped at Hulluņiyatirtha. Vidyabharana's name was afterwards expanded into Vadividyabharana, by which appellation he is mentioned in the Ablür inscription C., and line 44 of the Balagâmi record of A.D. 1149. 
As far as dates go, the next name is that of Jn anasakti, who is mentioned as a disciple of Vadividyabharaṇa in the Ablûr inscription 0. This record gives dates for him in A.D. 1130 and 1144. In A.D. 1130 his feet were laved by the Naprabhu Barmagávunda, when the latter made his grant to the god Brahmêsvara of Abbalür. In this record there is used a 
1 The Yowel in the first syllable of this name is properly the sbort . It was lengtht ned here to suit the metre. 
"A record of A.D. 1098 (P. 8. 0.-C. Inscrs, No. 167, Mys. Inscrs, p. 107) mentions (line 91 f.) « Srikanthapenditadêya, the Acharya of the temple of Pafigbalinga." But he must have been a different person, if only because the date there given for him is later than the date of Somdávara, the son and disciple of the Srikantha who was the son and disciple of Kedarasakti. 
3 Mr. Rice (Mys. Insors. Introd. p. 90, note) would allot to him an earlier date, in A.D. 1071, fi record at Balaglwi (P. $. O.-O. Insors. No. 160, Mys. Inscr8. p. 164). But the person there mentioned (lines 26, 29 f.) was a different person, demely somèsyarapandita, Sthdnapati of the god Mallikamodesvareh, and a disciple of Chandrabhashanapandita. 
4 This record was composed by Mallikarjunarya or Mallikarjunabhatte, who describes himself as a servant (Icinkara) of Somèsvars. In it, he three times (lines 34, 60, 84) speaks of Somêśvara za dvasvata-mahddaya. which may or may not mean anything more than simply " a master, a leader, of learned people."

We take up the line again from the record of A.D. 1129. The arrangement of this document is rather unusual. The ordinary part of it.-- ending with the date and the details of the grant -- comes to a closc in line 72. But the benedictive and imprecatory passages, which Would usually stand next, do not commence till line 76. And there interve110s a parenthetical passage, which is now to be considered. As already stated, this record says, in lines 02 to 64, that Vidyabharana transferred all thc business affairs of the matha to "his own chief disciple Vâmasakti;" the words in the original are. - Enisid=& Vidyabharaṇam vidlya-bharağa vyâsamgav-allad-itara-vyâsamganan=ollade matha-vyåsangaman nij-âgia-sishyanun guru kula-samuddharana-pama-saktiyum=enisida Vårasakti-munijyarano!= niyojisid-agale : and this prose passage introduces a verse which says that he directed Vamasakti to "protect' the nathu, i.e. to manage it. But the opening verse of the record invokes the protection of the god Kédérésvara for Gautama, who is described in it as having received the idhipatya of the Kėdâramatha by the favour of the command of Vidyabharana. And the parenthetical passage, which intervenes between the donative portion and the benedictive and imprecatory passages, commences by telling us that Vidyabharana transferred the office of head of the matha to "his own chief disciple Gautama;" here, the text ruus (lines 72, 73), in verse, with a prose connection,--Ål Vidyabharaṇam vidyê-vividha-vinoda-yôga-saukhya[m] sthiti-[bha]mg-ávalav= end=adan=ēļisi bhûviunta-mij-agra (sish]y[a] Gaustama-muniyo! || Math)-âdhipatyamam niyojisid-ågale. There is nothing in the record that explains why Gautama, as well as Vámasakti, is called the chief disciple of Vidyabharana, and why Vidyabharana “censured" or came to regret the happiness of having devoted himself to the various delights of learning because it had proved "destructive of stability," and on that account, appointed Gautama to the office of Mathapati. And it is not at all intelligible why, after a verse in lines 73, 74, which runs on in construction with the words 424yőjisid-ágale, and says that, just as saints before him, like brilliant lampa, had lit up the matha, so Gautama lit it ap, like a very pure gem that serves as a lamp,-the parenthetical passage ends with a verse (lines 74 to 76) which makes no mention at all of Vidyabharana, and says that the fortunes of the matha were vourished by Sômêśvara, and then by Våmasakti, and then by Gautama." Bat, evidently, when he entrusted the management of the affairs of the matha to Våmasakti in order that he himself might devote his whole time to stady, Vidyabharana retained the actual ofice of Mathapati in his own hands. And it seems clear that the record, though registering a grant made in A.D. 1129, was not really drawn up till some time after that date. In the interval, something or other must have occurred, not disclosed in the record -- which prevented the eventual succession, that was doubtless intended, of Vâmasakti as Mathapati, and led to the substitution of Gautama as being the next senior disciple. 
The Vâmasakti who is mentioned in the record of A.D. 1129, does not figure in any other of the records. But, for Gautama we have subsequent dates in A.D. 1139 and 1149; and he is mentioned in also some of the later records. The record of A.D. 1139 speaks of him as

Gautamärya and Gautamadêva, the Acharya of the Kodiyamatha, and tells us that two sculptor's named Bivant and Råvaņa, in order to do away with, 4.e. to make amends for, some fault committed by their guild, founded a temple of the god Kusuvesvalia in connection with the temple of Kôdärêśvara, and gave it to Gautama, and that, along with some other grants, Gautama himself allotted, for the purposes of this temple of Kuşuvėšvara, sixty kammas of rice-fields in the hakkalésaya-land belonging to himself in the open plain on the east of the culturable land of the god Narasimha. The record of A.D. 1140 speaks of him as Gantamarya and Gantamapanditadêva, the Acharya of the Kêdêrasthana, and the disciple of Vadi vidyabharanapanditadêva, and tells us that his feet were then laved by the Såntara lahú mandalesvara Tribhuvanamalla-Jagaddévarasa and his son Bammarasa, who had come to Balligáve, on the occasion of granting to the god Dakshiņa-Kédâreśvara a village in the Santalige thousand. 
The successor of Gautama was his son and disciple Vâmasakti,- the second of that name. He is mentioned first in a record which belongs to the end of A.D. 1155 or the beginning of A.D. 1158, according to the way in which we interpret the date, which is not recorded correctly. This record does not mention ally members of the line previous to Gautama. It introduces him with another adaptation of the verso that is elsewhere found first in the record of A.D. 1129; Lure (line 35 f.) it runs.-- Müvara-kôņeya-santati-dêvavratan-esava Parvvat-avaliyo! tân=åvirbbhavisidan-amala-yaśô vibhava-viuütan=enipa Gautama-munipa (111*). The next verse tells us that Gautama's son was Vânzaśaktipaņditadêva. And the dountive pissage describes Vamasakti as the Acharya of the sthána of the god Dakshiņa-Kêdîrosvara, and tells us that his feet were laved by the Mahápradhana and Dandandyaku Iliyidêyarasa, the Hergade of the raddurúvula and hejjunka duties of the Banayase twelve-thousand, on the occasion of making a grant to that god. A record of A.D. 11581 mentions liim in lines 60, 61 as the Acharya of " the Kodiyamatha of the Fergade Veuna marasa," in line 72, as the Aradhya or family-priest of the Muhậpradhông and Dandandyaka Kesimayya, Kesiraja or Kéśavadê vain line 74, as the son of Gautamamuni, and in line 75, as the Rajaguru or royal preceptor; and it tells us that his feet were then laved by Kêsimayya. The record of A.D. 1182 describes him in line 40 as the disciple of Gautama chârga, and tells us that then, on the occasion of making a grant to the god Dakshiņa Kêdärêśvara, his feet were laved by the Kalnchurya Mahamandalesvara Bijjala, who was encamped at Balligare in the course of a state progress uudertaken with a view to secure the possession of the southern provinces. The record of A..D. 1188 mentions him again as the Acharya of the sthana of Dakshiņa-Kedieśvara, as the Rajaguru, and as "the beloved disciple of Gautamadêra," and describes him (lino 33 ff.) as "a very Panini in grammar, a vory Bhashanacharya in political science or moral philosophy, A Very Bharata in knowledge of dramatic representation and tho other Bharatašástras, a very Subandhu in poetical con position, a very Lakuliśvara in establishing conclusive arguments, and a very Skanda on the earth at the feet of Siva, and tells us that his feet were then laved by the Mahasamanta, Senddibdhattaraniyôgddhishthayaka, Mahápradhana, Sarvadhikarin and Mahápasáyita, the Dand aniiyaka Boļikeya-Kêsimayya, in making a grant to the god Dakshina-Kedaradêva. Ai record of A.D. 11714 mentions him again as the Rajaguru Vámasaktidêva.

king Sankama, who had come to the south, the best of all countries, with all his ministers, on a pleasure-trip, and also by the Mahûmandalesvaras Tailahadeva and Erabarasa, who added to the graut made by Sankama a grant by themselves becanse the Gurus of the sthana were their own fainily preceptors; and an addition to this record registers the fact that in A.D. 1188 Vâmuinkti himself granted some land to the masons Bisandôja, Båvoja, and Siögôja, being pleased with them for building a mantapa of the god Kádára. And finally, we have a later date for him from the record of A.D. 1192, which mentions him again as the Rajaguru, the son of Gautama of the Parvatávali, and tells us that his feet were then laved by the Mahápradhana, Sarvadhakärin, and Mahápasdyita, the Dandanayaka Ereyanna, in making a grant, on behalf of his sovereign lord the Hoysaļa king Vira-Ballâļa II., to the god Dakshiņa-Kedardśvara. 
After this, there were another Srikantha and a third Vâmasakti; and with them our knowledge of the line comes to an end for the present. We take their names from the record of A.D. 1215. This record contains, in line 19 f., the following verse, in connection with the temple of Dakshina-Kádárêsvara which is mentioned just before it - Upåsa të Virupakshan tatra Kôţi-matha-sthitaḥ Våmasaktir-yyathê půryvan=upamanyur=mmahi-tapâḥ,-* there they worship the god Virupaksha; As formerly did the zealous Vámasakti, abiding in the Kotimatha, and practising severe penances." The reference bere may be to either the first or the second Vâmaćakti. The record goes on to mention, in lines 20, 21, “ Vâmasaktidêva, the disciple of the Acharya Srikanthadeva." It speaks of him in line 24 as the Sthåndchárya. And it tells us that then, in A.D. 1215, his feet were laved, at the sunkádhikard or office for the collection of customs of the Banavîse nád, by a certain Hemmayyanayaka, an official of the Mahápradhana, Sarvidhikärin and Mahaparamavisvasin Máyidêyapaņdita. 
In the mention of the Läkulasiddhanta in line 65 of this record at Ablûr, and in certain allusions in some of the Balagâmi records quoted above, reference is made to the doctrine of & Saiva teacher named Lakula, Lakulisa, Lakuļišvara, and Nakulića, the founder of the school of the Lakuliss-Pasupatas, regarding whom some information may conveniently be pat together here. The Cintra prasasti, which was composed in the period A.D. 1274 to 1296, (edited by Dr. Bühler, Ep. Ind. Vol. I. p. 271), claims that he was an incarnation of the god Sipa. It mentions, in connection with him, a place named Kårôhana, in the Lâta country, which Dr. Bühler has identified with the modern Kârviņ, about seven miles towards the west from Dabhôi in the Baroda State, :where four branches of his school were established by four of his pupils named Kusika, Gårgya, Kaarnsha, and Maitrêya. And Dr. Bühler under 
facts that I shall adduce further on, it seems clear that the words used in the original, samêtya Käróhanam-adhyuvása, - meaning, literally, as translated by Dr. Bühler, "he came to and dwelt at Kåróbana," -- are not to be interpreted as implying that it was at Kårôhana that the god became incarnate, but mean that Lakulisa came from some other part of the country and settled there. Dr. Bühler has told us that the doctrines of the Lekulisa-Pasupatas are explained in Sayapa's Sarvadarśanasangraha. But, he added," nothing is known regarding their history." And it is interesting, therefore, to be able to fix, from the southern records, the period when the founder of the school lived.

: For this form of the name, see Dr. Bühler's remarke (in his paper referred to in the next sentence), p. 274 and note 10. He has there told us that Nakulisa is the form that is commonly used in Sanskrit literature; and he has expressed the opinion that the older form is Laknlise, which he explained as "& compound of lalulin, 4.9. lakutin, and tša, the lord wearing the staff,' i.e. the khatvanga." We find the form Nakuliśvara in the Balagámi inscription of A.D. 1179 (see page 225 above, note 3).

These grandiloquent terms plainly describe, 110 ordinary priest of a temple, but someone of great note, who was a recognised leader among the Saivas. And te nced not hesitate about identifying the Lakuļiśvarapaņdita of this record with the Lakulien of the Cintra prasasti, who, therefore, was alive in A.D. 1035 and was then at Balagâmi. 
An earlier date for him is furnished by an inscription at Mélpadi near Tiruvallam in the North Arcot district. This record is dated in the ninth year of the Chola king Parakêgorivarma. Rajêndrachôladóva I., ie, in A.D. 1019 or 1020.6 It registers the fact that certain shepherds of that village pledged themselves to supply ghee for a lamp in the Ariñisvara Saiya tonunla And the declaration was made before the Pujari Lakuļišvara pandita, of the matha of the end Mahadeva connected with the temple. Here, we need not assume that mention is made of simply some namesake of the great Saiva teacher, or that the matha at Melpadi was a branah of an establishment previously founded in Gujarat; we may safely identify the Lakuliśvarapandita of this record of A.D. 1019-20 with the person of the same name of the Balagimi inscription of A.D, 1035. And it would seem, therefore, that Lakulisa commenced his career at Mêlpadi in North Arcot, and laid there the foundations of the reputation and influence that he subsequently acquired. -- that from there he went to Balagami in Mysore and attached himself to one of the great Saiva establishments at that place and that it was towards the end of his career that he proceeded to Gujarât and then, settling at Kanvar founded the school of Påsapatas which carried on the memory of him for so long a time.

And it then mentions his feadatory, the Mahasamanta who had attained the pañohamahásalda, the Dançandyaka Anantapâle (1, 4), who in the north spbdded the seven Málava countries up to the Himalaya mountains, and in the south drove all the kings of the dakshinasa or Dekkan into the ocean (1,5), and thus became famous among the leaders of the forces of the emperor; at the command of the Chåļukya emperor,5 he led an invasion, and gave the seven Mâļavas to the flames, up to the Himilaya moun tains (1. 6). 
The elder sister of the thus famons Dandandyaka Anantapála was Padmaladevi (1,7) She became the wife of Křishnaraja or Krishna (1. 8). And to them there were born Lakshmana and Gôvindaraja (1. 8). They had two younger brothers, named Mallidova and Ganapati (1. 9).

the golden mountain (Mêru), the abode of Achyuta (Visliņu), 1 -- and that it looked like the mountain of dawn, for the rising of the sun. Then there comes a string of epithets in prose, in the course of which he is mentioned as having acquired be excellent favour of the god Brahmêsvara (1. 30). And then we are introduced to his wife, Sugañabbe (1. 31). To them there were born two sons - Echi (1. 33), Echa (1. 34), Echama (1. 41), or Echagüvanda (1.51), and Mattiga (1.33) or Mutta (1. 45). Seventeen verscs follow in praise of the virtues and prowess of the two brothers. Then the record reverts (1.48) to the elder brother, Echagârunda, whom it mentions as a bee on the succulent water-lilies that are the feet of the god Hara (Siva) (1. 49), _as the moon of the water-lily that was the Maçanda family, - a8 & yery Vatsarâja with restive horses, 3 --and as being also called "the lion of his father" (1.50). His Gurl or religious preceptor wag Sôinéśvarapapditadêva (1. 51), the disciple of Srikantha (1. 52), who was the disciple of Kėdaraśıkti, wbo was the ajja.gurii, lit. 
granrlfather-preceptor,' of Somêśvarapanditadêva (1. 51), and was an ornament of the succession of teachers called the Mûvarakôņeyasamtati (1. 52). 
While the Mahâsîmanttl hipatio who had attained the pañchamahusabdla (1.59),— the choice elephant of his uncle (1. 603,6 -- the Dundundyaka Govindarasa (1. 61), was ruling the Hanumgal five-hundred, and the Bâsavura hundred-and-forty which was a kampana included in the Banavase twelve-thousand, and the Någarakbanda geventy, punishing the wicked and protecting the good, with the delight of an agreeable or friendly interchange of communications (with he's official superiors) (1. 62), he came in state to Abbalûr, 9 and saw the temple of the god Brahmêśvara which Bammagávupqa had caused to be made, and was pleased. And, Echagåvanda (1. 63) preferred a request, on the strength of which he (Govindarasa) laved the feet of Sômèsyarapanditadêra (1. 67), and made libations of water, and, at the time of the vyatîpâta and an eclipse of the sun on Sunday the new moon day of the month Vaisakha of the Vishu samvatsara, which was the twenty-sixth of the years of the glorious Châļukya Vikrama (1. 69), he gave, as a gift to the god Parameswara,ll the village of Muriganahalli, a town that was included in the Någarakhanda seventy (1. 67),” for the angabhôga of the god Brahmêsvara of Abbalûr (11. 67, 68), and for tha frankincense and the oblation, and for the repairs of whatever might become broken, torn, or worn-out, and for the provision of food for ascetics and for boys who were desirous of being taught,18 as a sarvanamasya-grant, free from all imposts. .

C.- Of the time of Perma-Jagadêkamalla II.-- A.D. 1144. This inscription, also, is at the temple which is now known as the temple of Basarestara, but was originally called the temple of Brahmêsvara.-The writing, consisting of fifty-two lines of about fifty letters each, covers an area about 2' 11" broad by the 81" high, and is in a state of perfect preservation almost throughout. The sculptures at the top of the stone are, in the centre, a liiga, with an officiating priest, inside a shrine; on the proper right side, the ball Nandi, with the san above it ; and on the proper left, & cow and calf, with the moon above them. The characters are Kanarese, of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are almost exceptionally well formed and engraved. The size of the letters ranges from " to 1". Except for the opening invocation of Siva and one imprecatory verse in line 45, the language is Kanarese, partly in verse, and partly in prose. The record gives us a word, khandarano (line 52), evidently meaning engraving,' which is not to be found in dictionaries." And, as variants, it gives gaunda (e.g. line 7) and gavunda (e.g. line 10), as farther foring of gauda, gavuça ; ' mal (in nálprabhu, lines 21, 51), as another form of nûl, = nưd, 'district' ;3 and lu? (line 33), as another form of hál, ruin, desolation, a waste' (i.e. land left anculti vated). In respect of metrical license, we may note that in line 8 Jakkave is written for Jakkaude, and in line 29 eppat-okkalu in is writton for eppatt-okkalun, simply to suit the metre. 
The inscription is a record of the time of the Western Chalukya king Perma Jagadékamalla II. It is a Saiya record. And it registers grants that were made, both in the reign of that king and on a previous occasion, to the temple of the god Brahmêsvara. The later grant was n'ade by a Dandanayaka named Mallibhavarasa, who was administering the modarúvula and hejjurika taxes under the Dandanayaka Yôgêśvaradêvarasa who was in charge of the Banavåse twelve-thousand province; and it consisted of an oil-mill and a tax, for the maiutenance of the perpetual lamp of the god. The earlier grant was made by a certain Banmagaunqa or Barmagaunda,” the Nálprabhu or official in charge of the local district; and the chief item of it was an area of land, as much as his horse was able to go round, ridden at full speed. 
The record contains two dates. The details of the first date, when the grant was made 15 Bummagaanda--- are Monday, the new-moon day, when there was an ecliose of the sun, of the month Magha of the Saunya samvatsara, which was the fourth year of the Western Chalukya king Bhálókamalla-Sômêśvara III. The giren samvatsara was Saka-Samvat 1052 Current. And the corresponding English date is Monday, 10th February, A.D. 1130 : on this day, the tithi ended at about 2 hrs. 29 min. after mean sunrise (for Ujjain); but there pras no eclipse. The full details of the second date -- when the grant was made by the Dandanûyaka Mallibhavarasa ; shortly after which time, presumably, the whole record was put ou the stone, are Sunday, coupled with the fifth tithi of the bright fortnight of the month Kärttika of the Raktákshin samvatsara, which was the seventh year of (Perma)-Jagadėkamalla II. (the son and successor of Şômêsvara III.). This date was not recorded correctly. The given saivatscrd was S.-S. 1067 current. And the given tithi ended at about 10 hrs. 50 min. after mrin sunrise (for Ujjain) on Tuesday, 3rd October, A.D. 1144, and cannot be connected with the Sunday at all.

ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. The record opens with the usual verse Nanasturigiu-siras-chumbi, etc., in praise of the god Siva under the name of Sambhu. It then refers itself to the reign of the asylam of the universe, the favourite of fortune and of the earth, the Blanürájádhiraja, Paramešvara, and Paranabhattáraka, the glory of the family of Satyaśraya, the ornament of the Chalukyas, the glorious Bhülőkamalladôva-(8ômêśvara III.) (line 3). And it then says that, while he was reigning, there was a certain Baminagauņda (1. 7), Bammagavuņda (1. 8), or Barmagayunda (1. 10), son of Echagauņda and Jakkarre (Il. 8, 9),— who was an angry bee on the water-lilies that are the feet of the god Hara (Siva), and whose wife was Bhigale (1. 20). 
One day, while the Nalprabhu Bamimagávunda (1. 21) was enjoying the pleasure of a talk about religion, the Senabova or accountant Boppa (l. 22), Boppaña (1.24), or Boppimayya (1.25), himself, also, a bee on the water-lilies that are the feet of the god Hara, sm-faced him, and reminded him that religion is one's aid, one's ornament, and one's treasure, and that therefore it is a man's duty to accumulate good works; that so it was that the shrine of the god Brahmtsvara at Abbalûr (12. 20, 27) had come along under the protection of Barmagáyunda's grandfather and father; that his ancestors and himself owed all their success to granting allotments to the shrine; and that the seventy husbandmen (1. 29), born in the lineage of the Settiçuttas of the place, and themselves always playing the part of angry bees on the rater lilies that are the feet of the god Ahindrabhitshaņa (Siva), had lifted high the religion of Sira, by concurring in all the religions proposals that he had made. 
On this representation (1. 30), Bammagirunda, inflamed more than ever with a desire for union with the passionate woman that is devotion to the god Siva, iiu mediately mounted a sery tall horse, and promised that, as far as his lorse should run at the top of its speed, so far le would give land to the god Brahmēśvara.. And so, having made his horse run (1, 33), and laying layed the feet of Jñâ nasaktipanditadiva (1. 88), the disciple of Vadividyabharanapanditadera of the Mûvaraköņeyasamtati, with libations of water, at the time of the vyatipáta on Monday, when there was an eclipse of the sun, the now-moon day of the inonth Megha of the Saumya samvatsara, which was the fourth of the years of ihe glorious Bhûlóka[malla*] (1. 39)," for the oblation and the perpetual lamp of the yol, and to provide food for ascetics, and for the repairs of whatever might become broken, torn, or WUTI•oul (1.60), he gave, free from all imposts, eight mattars of rice-land in the open fields called Hinwes2-11 (1.33), and six mattar.............,' and fifteen mattars ...nico, and a betel-nat plantation of one thousand trees bolow the large tank, and sites for twenty hunsas 
in that part of the town which belonged to the gods. 11

D.--Of the time of Taila III.- About A.D. 1158. This inscription is on a stone tablet in a field, Survey No. 137. The writing, consisting of forty lines of about forty letters each,8 covers an area about 2' 1" broad by 2' 11" high. It is in a state of very good preservation as far as the end of line 13. From that point onwards, it has suffered more or less damage. But all the historical information that I quote from it, can be made out without any doubt. And it is only from line 28 that the record becomes undecipherable. The sculpturos at the top of the stone are, in the centre, & linga; on the proper right side, a squatting figure, facing full-front, with the sun above it, and perhaps a water-pot.beyond it; and on the proper left, a cow and calf, with the moon above them. The characters are well-formed Kanarese characters, of the period to which the record refers itself. The size of the letters ranges from th to 3 - Except for the opening Sanskřit verse in praise of Siva, the language is Kanarese, throughout all the legible portion, partly in verse, and partly in prose. Lines 10 and 12, 13, give the word turaya, as & corruption of turaga, "a horse,' which is not yet shewn in dictionaries. 
The inscription is & record of the time of the Western Châlukya king Taila III. It mentions also his feudatory, the Mahasánantadhipati, Kariturayapattasdhani or groom of the head-trappings of elephants and horses, and Manevergade, the Dandanayaka Mahadêvarasa

tho was ruling the Banavåse twelve-thousand province and the Huligere thres-hundred district; and a subordinate of the latter, the Dandanayaka Mâyideja. And it further mentions a Mahamandaléérard Damed Sôvidêvarasa, belonging to some branch of the Kadamba family, who had the hereditary title of "supreme lord of Bândhayapura, the best of towng, and the epithet of "he who has attained the excellent favour of the god Prañamešvara."3 
That part of the record which contained the donative paggages and the date, is either illegible or broken away and lost. Bat, from the fact that Mahadêyarasa is here described as a feudatory of Taila III. himself, as also in the record of A.D. 1152, whereas in the Balagami inscription of A.D. 11555 he is described as a Dandanayaka of Bijjala, we may refer the present record to About A.D. 1153. 
ABSTRACT OF CONTENTS. The record opens with the usual verse Namas-tuga-siras-churbi, etc., in praise of the god Siva under the name of Sambhu. It then refers itself to the reign of the asylum of the universe, the favourite of fortune and of the earth, the Mahârájádhiraja, Paramesrard, and Paramabhattaraka, the glory of the family of Satyasraya, the ornament of the Chalukyas, the glorious Traiļôkyamalladêva-(Taila III.) (line 3). And it then proceeds to say that the Chôļika (1. 4) came against him in war, but had to unwillingly pay tribute to him; that, in the other direction, the king of Mâļava (1.5) was frightened and fed away to refuge, and the Gûrjars saved himself only by giving even more than the Chola had given (1.6); and that all other kings had to acknowledge the gway of the emperor Närmadi-Tailspa (III.) (11. 6, 7).

E.- Of about A.D. 1200. This inscription is on a stone tablet standing against the wall, or perhaps bailt into the wall, on the right of the god inside a temple of Siva under the name of Sômanitha, which appears to be the temple the foundation of which is recorded in the inscription. The writing corers an area about 3' 71' broad by 6'1" high. It is in a state of good preservation almost throughout The sculptures at the top of the stone are, in the centre, & linga, with a standing priest; on the proper right, the bull Nandi, with the sun above it; and on the proper left, a cow and calf, with the moon above them. The characters are Kanarese, of the period to Thich, from the internal evidence, the record is to be referred. The size of the letters is somewhat irregular, ranging from about in the 9 of jana, line 15, to nearly 1' in the sh of munnshya, line 24. The characters are mostly well formed and well engraved. But in many places they are difficult to read, because the execution is indifferent and imperfect, owing to sometimes the tops of the letters, and sometimos other parts of them, not being completed in the engraying, though marks in the ink-impression shew that thoy were sketched on the stone and were partially cut by the engraver. Some pointed instances of this are as follows :- In line 8, nishada-hinavanta reads at first sight gishadu-bůvavana, the hi, which may always be easily confused with bú, being badly formed, and the side-strokes which would turn gi into ni and va-into ma, and the whole of the subscript t, having not been filled in by the engrafer, though the ink-impression shews that they were more or less outlined on the stone ; in line 9, the tops of the second, third, fifth, and seventh alsharas are similarly imperfect in simu-muhima ka ndaran, and the atti at the end of the line was left almost, altogether anformed; in line 12, there are two instances in prakațitak, in which the k reads at first sight 28 T, and another, in sukcesiyu, in which the superscript vowel, as well as the top of the k, was left unformed; and in line 48, if the name of the Jain temple wero not known from other sources, it would probably have been read idegeijya, instead of dresejjeya. Many other similar instances might be pointed out; but the preceding ones seem suficient. Whether these faults are due to pure carelessness on the part of the engraver, or to his comiug unexpectedly on very hard places in the stone, it is difficult to say from simply the ink-impression. The characters include the upadhmâniya in puhpaļi, for pushpaļi, line 2. The lingual d is usually expressed by its distinct sign, which appears very clearly in mandana, line 7; but in a few places we bare the ordinary d. The dental dh is formed properly enough in svardhuni, line 9; but in some other places it is hardly to be distinguished from v, 8.g. in dhaman, line 2, and dhári, line 01. There is a somewhat rare medieval form of y in anvayadolu, line 62: we have clear instacces of the corresponding forms of m and , in marigi, line 44, and nilipevu, line 39; and the m is carried back to A.D. 804 by the Kanarage grant of Govinda III. (Ind. Ant. Vol. XI. P. 15; sce para-dattan=bu, line 14). The virúma is represented by its own proper sign in puru:lol, line 13, and in friman, line 84, and by the same mark, but imperfectly formed, in dúral, line 50 : elsewhere, however, it is represented by the vowel 4; and there are pointed instances of this in bhavanu, line 26, urulag, line 41, aluki, line 41-42, śrīmada, line 60, and etina, line 98. The anusvára is written sometimes, in the asual fashion, above the top line of writing, and frequently so faintly that it does not show in the lithograph, and sometimes, in a larger form, between the lines of writing; the word koindaran, line 9, illustrates both mathods of forming

it.- The opening invocatory verse is in Sanskrit ; & Sanskrit proverb is quoted in line 19; three Sanskrit flókas are introduced in lines 25 f., 32 f.; and there are seven of the usual benedictive and imprecatory Sanskrit verses in lines 94 to 98. With these exceptions, the language is Kanarese, in prose and verse mixed. Now that we have a proper vocabulary, the interpretation of this record presents no real difficulties, though I am indebted to Mr. H. Krishna Sastri for assistance in respect of the verses in lines 22, 35, and 40, and to Prof. Kiel. horn for advice in respect of some dubious points in Sanskrit passages : but it would have been impossible to deal with this exceptionally interesting and racy document verbatim, all through, without the Rev. Mr. Kittel's Kannada-English Dictionary; and I take this opportunity of recording prominently my appreciation of the great value of that scholarly and admirable work, which has now, for the first time, placed it in the power of Western students to understand fully, and do justice to, the beauties of the Kanarese language, especially in its classical and mediwral dialects, and also of expressing my thanks to Mr, Kittel himself for kindly perusing the proofs of my text and translation of this record and suggesting a few reänements in my rendering. The language of this record may be described as inter. mediate between the classical and medieval dialects of Mr. Kittel's classification. The forms are mostly archaic. But the more modern forms appear here and there, even in the metrical portions: in the prose passages, we may note iddalli, line 71, kshetradalli, line 91, the termination galige, lines 51, 77 (in the copulative form), and the ordinary neuter accusative with y, instead of m, in kalavan, line 19, and the copulative accusative with va instead of m, in kavilegaļuvan brahmanaruvan, line 93; in the verses we may note the neuter nominative in v, instead of m, in désav, line 11, utkatav, line 23, and various other places, and the neuter accusative with v, in anandavam, line 42-43, and such words as pratyakalav-dgi, line 31, and balikkau, line 43, where, again, we have the v instead of the m. In respect of vocabulary, we may note that lines 43, 48 give us balikkan, balikan, as variants of balikkan, balikom; lines 73, 93 give, as also do various other records, aļi, as a variant of aļi, 'to destroy, to be destroyed ;' and line 78 gives beyum as a variant of leykum, =belkti, béku, ' it is wished, it is due, it must, etc.-In respect of orthography, there is a constant ude of for v in Sanskrit words, and of ra for Ți, which requires to be corrected in the Verges so as to preserve the metre which is usnally satisfied only by restoring the dowel; but the only points to which special attention need be directed, are, the occasional use of ai and air for ay, in Ramaiyanan, line 47, Ramaiyyargala, line 61, Bamaiyannun, line 70, ainúruvañ, line 85, and ainüyor, line 88, and a frequent omission to double consonants after the letter r. 
The inscription does not refer itself to the reign of any particular king, and is not dated. But it is assigned to about A.D, 1200, or a few years earlier, by the mention, in lines 81 to 90 and 99, of the Kadamba Mahamandalesvara Kamadeva, and by the statement, in line 101, that the record, though put into shape by another person, was composed by the Dandanayaka Késavarają. For Kámadêva, who belonged to the Hångal branch of the Kadamba family, fe have dates ranging from A.D. 1181-82 to 1203;3 and Kéśavaråja must be the Mahápradhana and Dandanayaka Bolikeya-Kesimayya or Koširêjayya, for whom we have dates ranging from

The epigraphic records contain many technical expression B,ma particularly in the way of titles, territorial terms, names of gode, guilds professions, taxes, teiures, measures, and -50 0n; but also some inore ordinary words- which Mr. Kittel's dictionury does pot explain, because, no doubles they do not occur in ordinary literature or ip the Native vocabularies of the language. It may be hoped that, if be abould ever jøsas supplement to it, he will examine the edited records, and see what can be done to collate, examine, and explain such expressions : while doing what I can' in this direction, I can really do little rigore than call attention to points which come prominently to my notice in nearchiug for the meanings of words which are not intelligible at first sight; and I cannot undertake to collect all the different variaate of Kanarese words which are found in the inscriptious, We still reqaire a grammar of the clagsical and medieval dialects, written in English anıt ou Curopean iintin.

A.D. 1168 to 1181 in records which connect him with the government of the Bapavâși twelve thousand and other districts. Before them, niention is made of the Western Chalukya king 8ômêsvars IV. (A.D. 1183 and 1189); and before him, of the Kalachurya prince Bijjala (A.D. 1145, and 1156 to 1167). A. short passage at the end, evidently added at a somewhat later date, mentions a Kadamba prince Mallideva, and recorded some graut which he, also, made to the same temple. 
The interest and importance of the record centre in the fact that it discloses the name of the person, Êkântada-Ramayya, who towards the close of the twelfth century A.D. brought about a revival of the worship of Siva, or a fresh impetus to the Saiva faith with elaborated and improved rites and practices, which eventually culminated in the establislıment of a new sect of Siyablaktas or worshippers of Siva, called technically Vira-Saivas, i.e. "brave, fierce, or strict Saivas, Saiva champions," and popularly Lingâyats or Liigawants, i.e." those who have the linga or phallic emblem." The Lingâyats-- (using the appellation by which all average members of the sect would describe themselves) - are outwardly distinguished from the ordinary Saivas by the practice of carrying about with them a miniature linga, usually in a silver box suspended from the neck and hanging about the waist. And the chief characteristics of their faith and practices are, adoration of the linga and of Siva's bull Nandi, hostility to Brahmans, disbelief in the transmigration of the soul, contempt for child-marriage, and approval and habitual practice of the remarriage of widows. They are found chiefly in the Kanarese country; their vemacular is Kanarese ; and it is due almost entirely to then that this beautiful, highly polished, and poworful language has been preserved, in later times, amidst the constant inroads of Marathûs from the north. They now constitute about thirty-five per cent. of the total Hindů population in the Belgaum, Bijapur, and Dhârwâr districts. In Mysore and the Kolhapur State, they number about ten per cent of the Hindů popalation. And they are also found, but in smaller proportions, in the districts of Poona, Sholapur, Satârâ, and North Kunara. Elsewhere, they are constantly met with; but as the result of the migration of isolated families, mostly in connection with trade and manufactures. In the Bijapur and Dharwår districts, and possibly in the neighbouring parts of the Nizâm's Dominions and Mysore, the sect appears to be still steadily gaining ground, And an interesting internal movement was observable in 1891, when large numbers of the members of it claimed to have themselves entered in the census returns under the designation of Vira-Saivas, in preference to that of Lingayats, with which they had been content on previous similar occasions. 
According to the tradition of the Lingâyats themselves, as embodied in their principal sacred writings, the Busavapurana and Channabasavapurâna, the events which led up to the 
establishment of the new sect were as follows: 
To a certain Mâdirâja and his wife Madalåmbiki, pious Saiyas of the Brâhman caste, and residents of a place named Bågewadi which is usually supposed to be the subdivisional town of

that name in the Bijúpur district, there was born a 80n, who, being an incarnation of Siva's bull Nandi, sent to earth to revive the declining Saiva rites, was named Basava! Thou the usual time of investiture had arrived, Basave, then eight years of age, having meanwhile acquired nuch knowledge of the Saiva scriptures, refused to be invested with the sacred Brahmanical thread; decluring himself a special worshipper of Siva, and stating that he had come to destroy the distinctions of caste. This refusal, with his singular wisdom and piety, attracted the favourable notice of his uncle Baladêva, " prime minister "2 of (the Kalacharya king) Birala, who had come to be present at the ceremony; and Baladôvs gave hiin his danghter Gangadêri or Gaugâmbâ in marriage. The Brâhmaņs, however, began to persecute Basava, on account of the novel practices propounded by him. And he consequently left bis native town, and went to a village named Kappadi,' where he spent his early years, receiving instruction there from the god Siva, in the form of the local god Samgamëśvara. 
Meaur hilo, his uncle Baladeva died. At the advice of the deceased minister's relatives, Bijjala dcuided on securing the serpices of Basava, whose ability and virtues had now become priblicly kigyn. After some demur, Basaya accepted the office; having the hope that the indneuce attached to it would help him in propagating his peculiar tenets. And, accompanied by his elder sister Någalizo lika, be proceeded from 'Kappadi' to Kalyana, there he was welcomed with deference by the king, and wax installed as prime minister, commander-in-chief, and trcasurer,--second in power to only the king himself;5 and the king, in order to bind him as closely as possible to himself, gave him his younger sister Nilalochanâ to wife.“ 
Somewhere about this time, from Basava's unnarried elder sister Nagalâmbika, who was an incarnation of the intelligence of the goddess Parvati, there was born, by the working of the spirit of Siva, a son, who was an incarnation of Siva's son Shivamukha or Karttikėya, the god of var? Because, the Channabasavapäring says, he was more beautiful than Basava, in many respects, he was named Channabasava, ze. " the beautiful Basava."8 And he seems to be depicted as playing a more important part than even Basava himself in the propagation of the tenets of the new sect; for, Basava is represented as receiving from him instruction on important points connected with it. 
The two Puranas are occupied, for the most part, with doctrinal expositions, recitals of mythology, praises of previous Saiva saints, and accounts of miracles worked by Basava. And it is only quite at the end of each of them, that we come again on any matter that purports to he historical. They assert, however, that, with the influence that his official position gave the ancle, Basava and his nephew propagated with great energy and activity their doctrines, which included the persecution and extermination of all persons,--and especially the Jains.--- tyhose croed differed from that of the Lingayats.io Coupled with the lavish expenditure incurred by Bagava, from the public coffers, on the support of the Jangans or Lingayat priests, the proceedings aroused in Bijjala, who was of the Jain faith, ll feelings of uneasiness and distrust, which are said to have been fanned from time to time by a rival minister named Mafichapņa, in spite of the latter being himself, in secret, & Vira-Saiva.2% And at length an event occurred, which ended in the &abassination of Bijjala and the death of Bisaya.

At Kalyåņa, there were two specially pious Lingayats, named "Halleyaga' and Madhaveyya,' whon Bijjala, in mere wantonness, caused to be blinded. Therenpon, says the Busavapurina, Basava himself leaving Kalyång for a place named 'Sarngamešvara, "2 
deputed one of his followers, Jagaddêva, to slay the king. And Jagaddêva, with two unnamed friends, succeeded in making his way into the palace and accomplishing his errand.-- stabbing the king even in the midst of his court. Civil war ensued. And, the news coming to Basava as he was journeying, he hastened on his way, and, reaching Kulali-Samgamëśvara.' was there absorbed into the god; wbile Channabasava fled to Ulvi, in North Kanara, where he found refuge in a caye. 
The Ohannabasavapurana gives a somewhat different account. It places first the death of Basava, who, it says, was absorbed in Samgamesvara in the month Phålguna, falling in A.D. 785, of the Raktákshin samvatsara, Saka-Samvat 707 (current); and the only reason that it assigns, is, that news bad reachod Basava that a certain Prabht, who was an incarnation of Siva, had left Kalyäņa, and had been absorbed into Śiva in a plantain-tree at Srisaila -- leaving it to be inferred that Basava simply followed an example set to him by Prabhu. On the death of Basava, Bijjala appointed Channabasava to the office that had been held by his uncle. After this, the king caused the pious' Halleija' and 'Madhaveija' to be tied to a rope and dragged about the ground till they died. In revenge for this, Bijjala was slain by two torch-bearers, named Jagaddeva and Bommaņa. Then Channabasava, who had meantime sent away many Lingåyats to Uļvi under the pretext of celebrating a feast in honour of the god Janganaśyara, gathered, together his horses and men, and left Kalyana to follow and join them. The "son-in-law" of Bijjala started in pursuit. And a battle ensued, in which the pursuors were destroyed, and the king was taken captive. At the advice of Någalàmbika, however, Channabasava restored the slain army to life; and, having impressed upon the king that he should not persecute the Lingayats, as bis predecessor had done, but should walk in righteousness, he anointed him, and sent him back to govern his country.7

• The Purana ends with various other prophecies, pot connected with the present subject, to the effect that the king, thus Anointed, should reign for sixty years from the death of Basava; that then, at x ting lien tho Hopsala kingdon was fourishing, the Turks,- (the original probably has Turushkas),- led by the giant Pitamiem, born among them by the blessing of Siva, should come and vanquish Bijjala, destroy Kalyaņu, kill cuttle in the temple of Siva, erect & mosque there, and build the town of Kalbarigi; that the kings of Aneguudi should build the town of Vijayanagara, near Hampe; that Pitambol's aud his house should reiga ofar the land for serun bundred and Beventy years; that then there should arise a king uemed Vasantaraya, who would drive the Turks out of the country and restore Kalyans; that, all the Saiva siuta coming to life again, Chennabasa va should become the prime minister of this king, and Bagaga the commander of his forces; aud that thus the Liigågat religion should be re-established and greatly increased. - These prophecies" are, of course, nothing but coulased reminiscences of intervening history up to tuc time when this Purand was written (A.D. 1585-86 ; Bee pagu:,39 above, pote 4).

The Jain account, as given in the Bijjalardyacharitra,l puts things very differently. Basava's influence with the king is attributed to the fact that he had a very beautiful sister. whom the king took as & concubine. And the end of Bijjala and Basaya is related thus:-- Bijjala had marched against and subdued the Kôlhậpur chief, 1.c. the Silâhâra Maha mandalesvarc, who must have committed some act of rebellion. During a halt on the way back to Kalyâņa, Jangam arrived, sent by Basava, and disguised as a Jain, and presented the king with a poisoned fruit, the mere smell of which caused his death. He had time, however, before dying, to tell his son “Immaţi-Bijjala," se. " the second Bijjala," that it was Basava who had sent the fruit, and to enjoin him to pat Basava to death. Immadi-Bijjala accordingly ordered that Basaya should be apprehended, and that all the langams, wherever seized, should be executed. And, on hearing this, Basava threw himself into a well, and died; while his wife · Nilâmbâ '3' poisoned herself. Channabasava, however, after Immați-Bijjala’s resent ment was allayed, presented his uncle's treasures to the king, and was admitted to favour and to a ministerial office at court, 
Such are the traditional accounts. There are, howerer, no apparent reasons for attributing either to the Lingayat Puranas, of which even the earlier one was written two centuries after the events which it purports to record, or to the Jain poem, any greater historical accuracy than other Hindu works of the same class have been found to possess. And, on the contrary, there are fair grounds for questioning the correctness of the narratives given by them. The Lingayat and Jain accounts differ very markedly, and to a far greater extent than can be accounted for on simply the supposition of & representation of true facts from different sectarian points of viow. In respect of the circumstances immediately attending the deaths of Bijjala and Basaya, even the Lingayat Puranas are not at all in accordance with each other. The Channabasdua purina allots to these events the absurd date of A.D. 785, which is too early by close upon four centuries. Even the Jain poem appears to place them, not only twelve years before the time, in A.D. 1167, when Bijjala, still alive, abdicated in favour of his eldest son, but also even before the time, in A.D. 1156, marked by the introduction of a reckoning of his own, when Bijjala commenced his independent career. And whereas, if Basaya and Channabasava really held the high office that is allotted to them by tradition, we ought to have found by this time to clear mention of them somewhere or other in the mass of epigraphic records that has now come under observation, no allusion of any kind, applicable to either of them, has been obtained, except in the Managôļi inscription of A.D. 1181 (above, page 9). That record gives us the names of Basava and Mâdirâja, both of which appear in the Basava purâna, in connection with the foundation and endowment of a linga-temple, evidently of some considerable size and repute, at Managôļi in the neighbourhood of Bâgewâdi, the alleged residence of Mâdiraja and birthplace of Basava ; and, in doing so, it really seems to give us the original of the traditional Basava who figures in the Lingayat Puranas and the Jain book, And, in disclosing the facts that the parents of Basava were, not Madirâja and Madalambika, but Chandiraja of the Kaśyapa gôtra and Chandrâmbikd, and that Mâdiraja belonged to altogether & different family, namely the Harita gôtra, it furnishes further grounds for questioning the correctness of the Lingayat tradition, which, indeed, seems but little better than a legend. 
1 Loc. oit. p. 97; and Wilson's Descriptive Catalogue of the Maokenzie Collection, p. 320. - This doubtless denotes Sôvideva. But there is no epigraphic evidence for calling him Immadi-Bijjala. 
A wife of Basaya named Nilimbika, daughter of one of Bijjala'ministers, is mentioned, from another report," in Jour Bo, Br, R. 88. Soc. VOL. VIII. p 70. 
Sir Walter Elliot has said that Bagava's sister, who became the king's mistress, was named Padma that it was at Ulvi that Basar& drowned himself ; and that there events occurred, according to the Juin poem, in Kalivuga-Samont 4255 (expired), = Saka-Samrat 1077 (current), = A.

For the full story that is told in the record now published, reference may be made to the translation, page 252 below; a great deal of it cannot be materially abridged. without detracting from its interest and merits. We have to make allowance for the super natural agency, the divine birth of the hero as an incarnation of Virabhadra the attendant of Siva, and the miracle of his cutting off his own head and having it restored to him by his god.-- all of which, narrated apparently while the subject of the story was still alive, or at any rate very shortly after his death, illustrates how quickly, in India, real historical events may come to be overlaid with what is purely imaginary and mythical. But, if that is done. the narrative is reasonable and plain, and has the clear ring of truth in it. It shes ng the real person to whom the movement was due, and the way in which he started it. And it amounts to this: 
To a Saiva Brahman named Partshottamabbatta, who belonged to the Srivatsa cótro, and was an inhabitant of a town named Alande in the Kuntala country, there was born & son named Râma, who became an ardent devotee of Siva, and, by the intensity and exclusiveness of bis worship of that god, acquired the name of Ekantada-Râmayya. He visited various Saito places of pilgrimage. And eventually he came to Huligere (Lakshmeshwar), where there was a temple of Siva under the name of " the Sómanátha of the South,"and then to Ablûr, where. in addition to the place being plainly a stronghold of Jainism, there was, as we learn from the other records (pages 213, 232, above), an evidently important and influential Saiya establishment at the temple of Brahmê yara. At Ablûr, he got into controversy with the Jains, who, led by one of the village-headmen named Sankagauņda, sought to interrupt and put a stop to his devotions. Some wager was made, the terms of it being recorded in writing on a palmyra-leaf, on the result of which the Jaios staked their god and their faith. Ekântada-Råmayya won the wager, And then, as the Jains refused to do what they had pledged themselves to do, namely to destroy their Jina and set up a Siva instead of it, he himself, in spite of their guards, their horses, their chieftains, and the troops that they sent against him, overturned the Jina and Taid waste the 
1 This place may be safely identified with the modern Aland or Alande, the chief town of a tâluke of the game game, if the Nizam's Dominions -- the Allund' of the Indian Atlas, sheet No. 57, lat. 17° 33', lovg. 7638. At the temple of Isvara at Nimbargi in the Kalburigi täluka, twelve miles south of Aland or Alande, there is an ineerintion with dates in A.D. 1047 and 1098 (Card-Désa Inscts. Vol. I. p. 92); and the pagluge of A.D. 1047 speaks of the conntry of Alande in the country of Kuntala." It registers the grant of a village named Godivas Mégatige in the Gonkanâd district of the Alande thousand. This particular village cannot be identified with any cartainty, it may be 'Goody,' four miles on the souch-east of Nimbergi, or it may be 'Goody,' nine miles on the sontb-west of Nimbergi. But the Alande thousand is evidently the curatry round Aland or alande and Nimbare From the entry in the Indian Atlas, the modern name would seem to be Aland. In the titlings, however, of some ingcriptions at the neighbouring rillage of Ruddawidi, it is given as Alande in Sir Walter Elliot's collection. 
1 For the explanation of the prefix to his game, see lines 28, 29 of the text. 
$ The temple still exists. There is another mention of Somandtha of Purikara (1.e. Haligerc) in gn inscription of A.D. 1096 at Baligimi (P. 8. and 0.-C. Inscrs, No. 166, line 31 f.), which says that it was through the excellent favour of tbe god Sömêsvara of the city of Purikaranagara that his son $ômé vara or Sdvidere was born to Sarvadora, a Dandandyaka of the Western Chalukya king Vikramiditya VI.- It is worth noting that the form of the name in this record is Parikara -- Dot Pulikara, As given by Mr. Rice (Mys. Inscra, p. 172), and as it ocoors elsewbere. The second akihara is rather in distioct in the photograph: but it is recognisable as ri: and the ordsa or alliteration requires that the consonant should be r. 
The record aggerts that he cut off his own head, and laid it at the feet of his image of Siva, which had been brought out of the temple for the purpose of the ordeal, and that, after seven days, it was restored to him by bis god, safe and soand, without & scar. And the exact spot on which, according to tradition, this was done, is marked by the next record, F., page 260 below. The story of his cutting off bis bead is mentioned in the Channabasang. purdna (Jour. Bo. Br. R. As. 800, Vol. VIII. p. 198): but the controversy, in the course of which it is said to have been done, is there attributed to a Jain baving entered & Sains temple without removing his shogg: und the occurrence is located at Kalyana, where, it is guid, Rimayya bad gone in order to see Bijjala, whose fanie hyd spread it all directions. The same passage makes Ramayya quote, in his address to the Jain, an instance of previous kainit, Mahaklla, having performed the same feat at a rillage named Jambar, and also attributes repetition of the feat to & subsequeut seint, 'Ben kideva,' who beard the story of Rimayya.

: 1:ine, and, as, is gathered from subsequent passages, built for bis own god, under the name of Vim-Sómanátha, at Ablûr, a temple "las large," the record says, “as & mountain." The Jains then viunt and complained to Bijjala, who became much enraged, and sent for & käntada-Ramayya, and questioned hiin as to why he had committed so gross an outrage on the Jains. Thereupon Ekintada-Råmayya produced the writing on the palmyra-leaf, and asked Bijjala to deposit it in his trcasary, and offered that, if the Jains would wager their eight hundred temples, including the Apesejjeyabasadi, he would repeat the feat, whatever it may have really been, that he had already accomplished. Wishing to see the spectacle, Bijjala called all the learned men of the Jain temples together, and bade them wager their shrines, repeating the conditions ou a palmyra-leaf. The Jains, however, would not face the test again; saying that they had Como to complain of the injury that had already been done to them, and not to wager and lose any more of their gods. So Bijjala, langhing at them, dismissed them with the advice that thenceforth they should live peaceably with their neighbours, and gave Ékintada-Rimayya, in pablic assembly, a jaynpattra or certificate of success. Also, pleased with the unsurpassed hariog with which Ekintada-Ramayya had displayed his devotion to Siva, he layed Râmayya's jeut, and granted to the temple of Vira-Sômanâtha a village named Gôgâve, to the south of Mulugunda in the Sattalige seventy in the Banavåsi twelve-thousand. Subsequently, the record says, when the Western Châlukya king Sômêsvara IV. and his commander-in-chief Bihma were at Seleyahalliyakoppa, a public assembly was held, in which recital was made of the merits of ancient and recent Saiva saints. The story of Ékântada-Ramayya being told, Sonderara IV, wrote a letter summoning bim into his own presence at his palace, and laved his furt, or granted to the same temple the village of Ablûr itself in the Nâgarakhanda seventy in the Banayisi twelve-thousand. And finally, the Mahamandalesvara Kåmadêve went and wow the temple, heard all the story, summoned Ekântada-Råmayya to Hângal, and there livell his feet and granted to the temple a village named Mallavalli, on the north of Jógésara lleur lluqdagôd in the Hosanâą seventy in the Pânuṁgal five-hundred.5 
In this account, there is nothing inconsistent with the possibility of others being concerned in the matter and helping the movement 01,- for instance, the Basava or Basavaragayya of this Kliśyapa götra, of the Managôli inscription of A.D. 1161, who was a contemporary of Ékäntada-Ramayya, and in whom we may find the original of the Basaya of the Lingayat Pirings. And very possibly the Lingayat or Vira-Saiva sect was actually established, in sonowbat later times, by a person named Channabasava. In fact, as regards the first point, though the worship of Siya languished in some parts of the country, it had by no means died out; and on some other occasion we may go into the history of the Kålâmukha sect, of the Tarious other Saira establishments at Bulagimi, of the five-hundred Svåmins of Ailole, of the adherents of the Vira-Bananju doctrine, and of other religious bodies, scattered about all over the Kangrese country, from whom the movement must have received encouragement and support,

The record asserts that, on this occasiou, he undertook that, after cutting off his own bead, he would even allow his opponents to bury it, and still would recover it.

opite as much as from the Saiva establishment at the temple of Brahmośvara at Ablür itself. Rut the present record indicatos a crisis in the history of Saivism, when it was specially exposed to dancer from the attacks of the Jains, and, apparently, of some still existing Buddhist influences! It shews plainly that Ekantada-Râmayya was the person who came most prominently to the rescue of the waning worship. And, as it describes Bijjala as simply a Mohomandalesvara at the time when, after settling the quarrel betireun Ekantada-Ramayya and the Jains of Ablür, he made his grant to the new temple of Vira-Somanåtlia which Råmagya founded there, it places the exploits of Ramayya shortly before A.D. 1182, in which year Bijjala completed his usurpation of the sovereigaty by assuming the paranıount titles.

For the sake of the metre, either odardadan must be pronouuced 83 if it were written vodardadam, or else we must read todardadam, which gives exactly the same meaning. Otherwise, the last syllable of bhioadel remains sbort, and the metre is violated.

The more usual expression bere would be Read jtrnn-oddharakkan. 
8 Read pannirchchdsirada. We might correct the Sataligey of the original into Sataligey, in accordance with G. line 9, where the reading is quite clear, just 88 readily as into Satialigey. But the next line here shows 8attaligoy very clearlo : and we wust accept that as the form intended in this place also.

in bloom through all the seasons, with plenty of well-filled tanks and wells and pools, with sounds everywhere of cranes and buzzing bees and cuckoos and ruddy geese and peacocks and numerous fights of parrots and blue jays, and with the music of lutes in the diversions of courtesans. And when it had thus become a place of many charms, as being known to be the site of an infinite number of parks, and pleasing with inexhaustible pools of water, and crowded with many people, and the dwelling place of innumerable courtesans, and the abode of a countless number of merchants, there came down there, from the silver mountain (Kailâga), accompanied by Girija (Pârvatî), with great gladness, the god Sómanátha (Śiva), who has the water-Jilies that are his feet made tawny by the mass of the multitude of the rays that dart forth from the jewels inlaid in the tiaras of all the gods, and who is a very tree of paradise having for the ripening of its fruits the accomplishment of the desires of worshippers who bow down before him in supplication. 
(L. 17)-Among the residents of that town of Sômanatha, in the Brahmañ quarters, amongst the Brahmaps, there became famous one who resembled those (well-known) Vsasa and Suka and Vamadêva and Parâsara and Kapila and others; namely he, Purushottama, who was called the best of Brahmans - belonging to the Srivatsa gôtra ; praised by all other) Brühmaņs; acquainted with all the Vedas and Védangas; of an excellent disposition through possessing the virtue of pare behaviour. The good wife of that Brahman was Padmâmbike, of pure behaviour, devoted to her husband, who by her virtuous disposition caused herself to be likened to both Sitâdêvi (the wife of Râma) and the wife of that (well-known) Satyatapas(?). And, that husband and wife having remained for a long time without offspring, one day, having come to know the saying of the Vida that "there is no heaven for him who has no son,"4 the famons Purushottama, who practised truth and purity, did worship, together with his wife, to Sambhu, in order to obtain a son, saying " Isa is the protection from misfortune." 
(L. 20)-At that same time, when Mahdkvara (Śiva), whose feet, resembling water-lilios, are worshipped by the crowd of gods and demons,-- with Kôšava (Vishạn) and Vasava (Indra) 
accompanied by Umê (Pårvati), was enjoying the delight of an interchange of pleasing conversations in royal darbár in a delightful part of the mountain Kaiļága, Närada, the leader of the Ganas, spake thus:--- " While Obila, Dâsa, Chenna, Siriyaļa, Halåyudha, Biņa, Udbhata, and Malayêśvara who came here in human form, and Kêsavaraja, 5 and in numerable other hands, resigning the happinoss of earthly life, have been dwelling here in this

especial excellent abode of faith, the congregation of Saivas on the earth) has been aflicted mong the Jains a Buddhists," On his speaking thus, Maheśvara, with a smile on lis face that resonubled a water-lily, said to Virabhadr.m." Do thou, in the world of men, beget 
man with a portion of thyself, and then put & stop to those hostile observances." And thereupon Virabhadra came in a dream, in the guise of an ascetic, to Purushottamabhatta. and said " There shall be born to thee a son, who shall suppress hostile observances;" and te further said " Those many people, in the region of the south, who have trodden in the tatias of the Jains, all of them shall be put to shame, 0 master !, by thy son (who shall be calle.it Rama." Having thus spoken and having manifested great graciousness, he went away. Ami Purushôttamabhatta, fnll of content at having succeeded, obtuined a son, and periormen the birth-ceremony and other rites, and bestowed the name of Rama in accordance with the bidding of the god. 
(L. 27)-And while he (Rama), baring become imbued with meditation on Siya in a manner suitable to his divine birth, was practising observances with strict indifference to other things, it came about that, through the inteusity of his devotion which was directed entirely to one obiect, he was called one who had ono sole aim; and, having worshipped Siva with great exclusifeuesa, he acquired the name of Ekantada-Rama. And in the course of practising observances, with speech and body and mind always devoted to the feet of (Siva) the lord of Gauri (Parvati), 1. various sacred places prescribed by the Saiva traditions and on all the namerons great and small rivers where thore are altar's of Sarabhu, he came and beheld with joy the Sómanátha of the South,1 honoured by be gods, who drives away all sin. And when, having thus come, he was worshipping that Sônanátha of Huigere, whose feet are beautified by the cluster of the rays of the jewols in the tiuras of the greatest of the gods who unceasingly bow down before him, that supreme lord became manifest, and said:-(Here are two slólas) Go, Káma!, at my command, to the excellent village of Abbalûru, and take up thy abode there at ease, and wacrifice to me with strict devotion; and, without any apprebension, enter into controversy with the Jains, and wager thy head; and be victorious, O son !" 
(L. 33).And when, on the god Samanátha having thus given his commands, Êkântada Ramayya was abiding, with complete indifference to other things, at the shrine of the god Brahmášvara of Abbalûru, some of the Jains, together with that Sankagaunda, concerted tugother, and came to obstruct him, and with great resoluteness persistently sang the praises (of their own god) in the proximity of Siva, saying " Jina is the (true) divinity." When he heard that, Ekântada-Ramayya becardo very full of wrath, and said " It is forbidden to praise any other deity in the proximity of Siva:" but, refusing to desist, they continued vociferating ; and thon he spake thus:-"Who is it that croates the earth ?; who is it that protects it in the time of calamity ?; and further, who is it that is able to destroy it, when his anger becomes great ? : it is that samo Sambhu; and, in the face of the existence of him, who pervades everything, hov cau he (Jina) be a god, who came by chance into the world, and lived in bewilderment, and applied himself to practising austerity, and (only thus) attained happiness ? : does your Arhut bestow gifts as Hara (Siva) does ? ; has he ever given even øver so small a thing ?; (it is) from

Hars (that) in former days the devout Ganas Bina and Dinišala, and so many others, obtained hoong." On his having thus spoken, the Jains said. It may be so !;t but why dost thou simply talk of former wortbies?; cut off thing own head, under such conditions that all people may know of it, and offer it to him, and get it back from him, (and then we posll admit that) thou art indeed a pions mun and he is indeed the god." 
(L. 38).-When they had thus spoken, Êkantada-Râma said " If I offer my head to (Siya) the foe of Love, and obtain it back, what is the wager that ye will pay to me?;" whereupon they replied, in anger, “We will pluck up our Jina and set up an image of Siva." Then, Gaving " Give me (it in writing on), palmyra-leat," and taking the palmyra-leaf that they gave, Raina brought (his image of) Siva into the presence of the Jains) at the place where he was to straightway cat off his head and make an offering of it, and spake thus:-- "If I have ever not said that thou alone, O Sambhu !, art my protection without fail, and if ray thoughts kave ever gone astray after other gods, my head shall not go from me by the edge of this scimitar" but, otherwise, 0 Siva!, let it roll down before thy feet :" and, thus speaking, the brave R@ma, with a loud shout, and with an unfaltering hand, set himself to cut off his head 200 lap it at the feet of Sive. While the disciples were saying "Sarely he inflicted but a small yound; he drew the sword and thought, indeed, to do a bold thing, but then he became afraid and has preserved his body anhurt; he must have devised some mischief to the sword (bluniing it, so that it shall not wound him)," Râma, that man of ability, quickly and instantly cut through his own neck with as little difficulty as if he were shearing through a bundle of grass, and placed (his head) at the feet of Isa (Siva), and caused joy to the attendants of Bar kara (Śiva). 
(L. 43). After the severed head had been exhibited in public during seven days, Hars kindly gave it back: the head became sound again without any scar; and Rama received it back, to the kuowledge of all people. In much perturbation, all the Jains, in great distresa, bowed down on the ground and seized his feet, imploring him to abstain from destroying their Jina; bat, refusing to abstain, he fell on it like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and broke the head of the Jina. Just as a wild elephant in rut plunges into a grove of plantain-trees, and, thongh alone, sweeps everything away before him, so he, putting forth his strength, scattered the heroes who guarded it, and the horses, and the chieftains, and, while the opposing ranks of the Jains, crying out that Mâri (the goddess of plague or death)" had come upon them, were running away in flight, he beat the Jina till it fell; and there he made them accept the holy Vira-Sômêsa. 
(1.46) -When the Jains, having gone in a body, and having related all the matter in a cunning way to king Bijjaqa, were, with enmity, making a very slanderous complaint about it, king Bijjana became mad with anger, and looked at Rómayya with wrath, and said "Why hast thou done this evil thing ?;" whoreupon he showed the palmyra-leaf that they had given, and said :-“This is the palmyra-leaf that they gave; weigh it in thy mind, and place it in thy treasury ; let them wager again; if they dare further stake, in thy presence, (all) their various Jinaa, then I will cut off my head and place it as the stake in their handa, and will recover it even after they shall have burned it; but they shall wager to me the various Jinas of their eight bondred shrines, the chief of which is the Ånesejjeyabasadi." Thereupon king Bijjana said “We will see this marvel;' and he summoned the wise men of the shrines, and the other)

In such a way that the Earth became free from enmity, and Hortune, having come under his control, became herself a very mine of generosity to him, and Fame laid his commands on the mouths of all the rulers of the points of the compass, and the lovely womaa Victory was ever fettering the sword of his arm (to restrain him from altogether too eccessive conquests), Vira-Sômêsvara (IV.), whose valour was unassailable, and who was the moon of the water-lilies that were the eyes of the wives of his foes, acquired the sovereignty.

When the illustrions Mahümandalośvara Kamadevarasa; possessed of the string of names of, among others, the Mahamandalesvara who attained the panelamuhasabda: the supreme lord of Banavâsî, the best of towns; he who acquired the excellent favour of the God Madhukośvara of Jayanti (Banavasi); the delight of lenrned people; the ornament of the family of Mayûravarman; the lion of the Kadambag; the force in fight; ho who excelled in audacity; the elephant-goad of braye men; a very Ridhéya (Karna) in truth; % yery cage of thunderbolts to protect) those who sought refuge with him ; a very cow of plenty to petitioners, 
Was governing the Påpumigal flve-hundred, punishing the wicked and protecting the good, he came and saw the god Vira-Sómanátha of Abbalûr, and beheld the temple, as large as a mountain, which Råmayya had had made according to the precepts of the Saiva traditions, and listened in detail to the daring that he had displayed, and was pleased, and took him along with himself with the very greatest affection, and went away; and when his ministers and himself, together with the Mandalika Madukoya, were seated (in assembly) at the capital of Panumgal with the pleasure of an agreeablo interchange of communications, with the very greatest devotion he made the village named Mallavalli, on the Dorth of Jógésara which is near to Mundagôd in the Hosanad seventy which is a kampana in the Pinungal five hundred, together with its established boundaries and including the tribloga, into a nampeya grant for the god Vira-Sómanátha, and layed the feet of Ramayya, and gave it, with libations of water, with the very greatest devotion, for the repnirs of whatever might become broken or torn or worn-out belonging to the temple of that samo god, and for the angabhôga and the tangabhôga and the perpetual oblation of the god, and for the purificatory ceremony of the month Chaitra and the festival of spring and the other occasions, and for the giving of food; and thus he preserved religion. May it be well! Om! 
(L. 91). Those who preserve these acts of religion shall obtain the reward of fashioning in gold the horns and hoofs of a thousand tawny-coloured cows at the sacred Varanasi or Prayaga or Karukshetra or Arghyatirtha or Sriparvata or any otkor holy sites, and giving them to Brikmaņg versed in the four Vedas at such moritorions times as an eclipse of the sun, an eclipse of the moon, & vyatłputa, a passage of the sun from one sign of the zodliko to the next, etc.; those who destroy these acts of religion shall incor the sin of slaying those same cows aod Bribuang at the Ganges or Våranâsi or Kurukshatra or any other sacrvd sites! And, to shew

that there is no doubt about this, he quotes the sayings of Mana of former times ---- The earth has been enjoyed by many kings, commencing with Sagara ; whosoever at any time possesses the earth, to him belongs, at that time, the reward (of making this grant, if he continues it) ! The dust of the carth may be counted, and the drops of rain ; but the reward of preserving a religious grant cannot be estimated even by the Creator! He who confiscates land that has been given, whether by himself or by another, shall be born as a worm in ordare for the duration of sixty-thousand years! He who, though capable of better things), displays neglect in act or thought or apeech whether be be a person of good condition or a man of low caste, be is outside the pale of all religious rites! The maker (of a grant) shall raise seven times seven times seren families (to heaven); but he who confiscates shall cause the same number of families to sink down (into hell)! There may be absolution for one who slays a cow or a Brâhman on the Ganges or at any other sacred place, but not for inen who confiscate the property of gods or Brâhmans! "This general bridge of religion should at all times be preserved by you ;" thus does Råmachandra make his earnest request to all fature princes ! May it be well and auspicious; and may there be good fortune! Om! Om ! 
(L. 99)-- Saying "(As) I am thus (notoriously) a very treasury of austerities directed towards Hora, any small effort is not (becoming to me)," Ráma, the abođe of devotion to Sambhu, constructed (this great) temple of (Siya) the destroyer of the cities (of the demon Tripura). Without spending or asking for anything, even so little as a húga, which devotees, standing in front of him in reverence, might offer for the shrine, but going with great humility to the princes (and obtaining their contributions), through the inexhaustible favour of Siva Ráma mude this temple, resembling (Kailasa) the mountain of Hara; how successful he was ! 
(L. 101 - Kesavarâja, the leader of the forces, spake this record; and Saraņa-- the slare of Ísa; he whose refuge is the water-lilies that are the feet of Sivay-put it into proper sbure, and wrote it with facility. Om!

of sculptures, shewing, in the centro a linga, with a priest standing to it; on the proper right, two seated figures, with two standing figures waving chauris over them, and with the moon above: and on the proper lort, the ball Nandi, with the sun above it. Then come lines 1 to 10 of the writing. They comes another compartment of sculptures, shewing two beated figures, each inside a small pavilion, and with a standing figure, holding a chauri, on each side of each pavilion. And then comes the reinainder of the record. The writing covers in lines 1 to 10 an area about 2' 11" broad by 0'7" high, and in lines 11 to 16 an area of the same breadth by about 01 4' high. It is in & gtate of good preservation almost throughout. But down the proper right of the tablet there is some projection which more or less hides the first akshara of each line in lines 1 to 8 and 10, and prevents it from appearing fully in the ink-impression. And the record appears to have been left uufinished in the last line. The characters are Kanarese, of the regular type of the period to which the record refers itself; and they are well formed, though the engraving is rather thin and not very deep. The size of the letters ranges from abont " to nearly 3". The anusvára is formed in two ways, as in E. above; sometimes on the line of writing, and sometimes above it. The viráma is represented throughout by the sign for the vowel w; and a noticeable instance of this is in tatı-kahanadi, line 12. The lingual dig represented throughout by its own distinct sign.-The language is Kanarese, of the same transitional kind as that which we have in E. above. And the record is in prose and verse mixed. In line 3, we have the word buliya, - a variant of the baliya of other records, which according to dictionaries means " near to " (lit." of the vicinity of”), but which in such passages as the present is equivalent to the Sanskrit madhyavarton or antaryartin, "in the middle of, or included in '9 In the same line, we have bůda tadbhava corruption of the Sanskrit váta,-- which usually means, as here, " & town,' but is sometimes used in the sense of kampaņu, which Kittel's dictionary gives in the sense of " a district," and which I have sometimes translated by " an administrative circle of villages." And in line 15, we meet with the rare form ôgu, for hôga, in odar, = hódar, " they went." In respect of orthography, the only points that call for special notice are (1) the use of auvu for au, in pauournnani, line 1, and in gauvuda, lines 5, 8, 10; and (2) & very uncommon use of the initial long î in the middle of words, owing to which we have dvaļiîn for ávaļiyin, line 3, sálii and ölti for såļiyi and óļiyi, line 4, lilei for loleyin, line 6, sátra for súyira, line 9, and, still more extraordinarily, vaêri for varri, line 12. 
The inscription refers itself to the reign of the Dêvagiri-Yâdava king Singhaņa; and to a time when (a feudatory) Singañadevarasa was governing the Banavasi twelve-thousand province. The tablet is a virgal or monumental slab, in memory of the death of two local heroes, Micha and Gôma, in battle, on the occasion of a cattle-raid at Ablar. The raid was led by Isvaradeva of Belagavatti. From Mr. Rice's Mysore, 2nd ed., Vol. II. p. 448, we learn that Belagavatti is the modern Belagutti in the Honnáļi tâlnka of the Shimoga district, Mysore, the Bellagooty' of the Indian Atlas, sheet No. 42, in lat. 14° 11', long. 75° 35', twenty-four miles S. S. B. S. from Ablûr -- and that Isvaradeva belonged to a family of local chiefs mentioned in records there, which give another data for him in A.D. 1216, and give also the names of Mallidêva, A.D. 1196, Simbaladeva, A.D. 1232 and Birad@ya, A.D. 1249. 
The record is dated on the full-moon day, coupled with Monday, of the Pramåthin samvatsarı, specified as one of the years of Singhaņa. The regnal year is not cited, though it is asgal to cite it in any date expressed in this manner. The name of the samvatsara, however,

Mr. Rice writes the name 'Belegayatti.' In the present record, however, the vowel of the second syllable is distinctly @ note 
It should have been specified as his tenth year. The transcript in Carx.-Désa Inscrt, actually jogerts Oneya, as if it stood in the original; and it further reads Pramddhi, by mistake for Prandtki.

TRANSLATION Om! Hail! On Monday the full-inoon day of tho month Âshâdha of the Pramâthin samvatsara of the years of the glorious Simhamadôva, who was possessed of all culogistic titles; while the powerful and brave Singañadêvarasa was governing the Banayase twelve thousand, ma to describe the excellenco of Abbalûru, a town that was included in the Nágarakhanďa seventy which was a kumpana of those parts :-- 
(Line 3)-Abbalûru is truly charming on the surface of the earth, in a most exceedingly beautiful nanner, by reason of a park whicli is pleasing with flights of parrots and numbers of cuckoos, by the sweet-smelling rice* that grows luxuriantly, by a number of temples of the god Siva, by a shrine, to which (nuch) adoration is paid, of that samo god in the forni of him who canies a third eye in his forehead, and by a multitude of bravo mua who excel in strength and are skilled in arts and sciences, 
(1,5).-To give a description of the merits of Biragauậa of the Abbalaru that is thus charming :- Saying that he is devoted to the welfare of others, that he bestows gifts, and that he is a very ocean of virtae, the multitude of good and wise people joyfully praiso Biragauda, who is in mien as radiant as the hot-rayed su11,-- who is in overy way devoted to the water-lilies that are the feet of spiritual preceptors -- who is possessed of the very greatest resoluteness, -- and who is a very tree of paradise in giving support to all people who proclaim his preises. 
(1.8)-While that same Biragauda was continuing in happiness :-Belagavatti Isyaradeva, with various chieftains and with the Nayakas of the Såtalige district, together with ten thousand men and a thousand horses, came along, and descended on Abbalûru, and seized the herd of penned-up cows; and then, to describe the bravery displayed by Mâcha and Gôma, sons of Badagi-Kôtôja, in rescuing the penned-up cows at the command of 
Biragauda.com 
(L. 11)- While the valiant Badagi-Mácha, having rained blows on the array of horses that he drove away, was still attacking them, and while Gôma, having stared fiercely at them, was shooting arrows, the whole of the hostile force immediately fell down in all directions. What words can I use ? ; if you consider, it surpassed all comparison !: meeting them in the most terrifying manner, Mácha, the son of Kétôja, plunged recklessly into the hostile forde, and pierced many of them. In such a way that the bravery of these two brother's pas ? wonder to the earth, Mâcha and Gôma fought in battle with many people, and killed numbers of them, and went with great fame to heaven. 
| Read Mdchanum...The metre is faulty here, even with this correction. It might be set right by readiog Machonun Gömananud. And, from certain warks on the akshara go, it would seein that the writer recoguised 
of the đ in the first syllable of Maclanum, - began to correct it, by writing Micha after tbst word, and then turned the cha iuto go, and so produced the reading that actually stands. 
* Metre, Sloka (Anushtabh). 
s After this, there shoald come another line, containing the completion of this well-known perse, riz., pi sure dingand kshana-vidhvansini kayé kå chinta marané rand. These words may perhaps be somewhere on the aidy or back of the stone, and may have been overlooked by my copyist. But there is no reason why they should not have been engraved on the front of the stone, immediately below line 15; the stone was smoothed in order to form the subscript Ke of Hekódar at the beginning of that line, and was not smoothed any further; and it seems, tberefore, that the completion of the verse was carelessly omitted, either by the engraver or in the written copy from which he worked.

By T. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÜrtik+1%. Dr. IIultzsch having kindly consented to publish the accompanying Limitivo mazis. 179 bas heen proparod under Dr. Hleot's supervision, of the Doncayligrali nt sak - IVE *****, odited by mo above, Vol. IV. p. 356 ff., I take the opportunity of aditiva 1.-6T ak 491 the writing of that most beautifnlly eugraved inscription. I have already stris? thi tlim haurtur's are Telugu. Til general, they are the same as those of the Vinapadii rolat - ":1•1.nz, published with a photolithograph above, Vol. III. p. 59 ff., which are only abunt iure 's lator; but there are one or two interesting differences between the characters of the two inscriptions. 
OE initial vowels the Vanapalli platos contain the , i, and ri; in the mount munt i am i do not occur, but, on the other hand, we here lave also e, in the word 1 in linus 12 au 31; ". in Unit, 1. 1; and é, in évař, 1. 15, étud, 1, 38, eto. 
Of the ordinary Sanskrit consonants, uh, i, jland dI do not occur in de Dorepandi grant ; and the signs for chh and ñ only occur in conjuncts, as subscript letras, j anvichekha4, 1. :)), yavachchhrímín, 1, 39, and vijñúna, 1. 34. The signs which may be specially drawn attention to are those for k, ph, and th. 
In the sign for k the horizontal line between the top-stroke (talaketu) and the circle is joinod with the latter by a straight line, which forms a sharp angle with the horizontal lits, as may be seen from kari, 1. 1, Kruta, 1.2, etc. This (cursive) sign for I., which does not occur iu the Vinapalli plates and is not found in any of the published galcographic Tables, is also used in the Dibbida plutes of Saka-Samyat 1191, published with a photolithograph above. y. lujutt. and in the three inscriptions of Kåtaya-Vena of Saka-Samvat 1313-38, pnblished above, Vol. IV. p. 328 ff. It clearly is the inmediate precursor of the k of the modern Telugu alphabet. 
The sign for ph is distinguished from the sign for p by a separate semicircular line, plisad below the sigo for p; compare the pha of phala, l. 4, with the pa of lanpaful, 1. 6. Th1891110 sign for ph is used in the Vanapalli plates, e.g. in phalaka, 1. 7. In a Chibrolu inscriptiun vf Jaya of Sake-Sairat 1157, we still find the earlier sign in which the distinguishing sunucircalar line intersects tho proper left vertical line of the sign for p.3 
The sign for bh, in the alcsharus bhong bhu, bhd, bhya and bhya, is distinguisberl from the aign for by the top-stroke of bh; compare the bha of bhava., 1, 3, with the ba of bubki-, 1, 9. In akaharas where there is no room for the top-stroke, bli sometimes is distinguisheil from ' lig 
NAIL 
* This verso is usually given more or less incorrectly,-for instance, P. S. 0-0. Insors. No. 219 229 niddañsana kayon; and No. 225 has vžddamsani; wbile No. 182 has surdgangi kshana-yuddrusini. But the first word is always jiténa (e..., P. S. O.-C, Inscrs. Nos. 212, 225, in both of which it is very clear, 49 also in the presont record), The interpretation of it seemed difficult to Prof, Kielhorn also, who suggested some time acu that the original roading might be givena (Ind. Ant. Vol. XVII. p. 202, poto 4). But he non considera that jitána is corrcot, and is to be translated by bim who has conquered," on the analogy of ridita, one who has learnt," in the first verse of the Kirdiárjuntya, where the commentary cites pita ginah, bhulfa brúlmunch nad vibhakta bhratarah, all in an active sense. Since writing the preceding remarks, I have haard from Prof. Kielhorn that he finds that the verse is from the Parafara smpiti, Aobdrakůyda, Adhyeya III, verse 37 (Bombay edition, Vol. 1, Part II. p. 273), which gives it in the form- Jitera lublyatá Lakshmir mrit dy=ápi surángarah Irshayadh uansini kdytasmia ka chinta mnarani rand, aud that Madba vâchárys explains jita as 4 1983passive parti. cipie degutiog the agent (wone who has conquered"), exactly 48 suggested by Prof. Kielhorn. 
I owe excellent impressions of these inscriptions to the kindness of Dr, Eultzsch. 
In the same inscription, of which I shall trest in Vol. VI., the sign for dh is distinguished from tive sion for by a semicircle, open to the proper right, which is placed below, and attached to the proper left car'le of the stor

(for abuisito), 1, 36, etc. It is interesting to observe that in all such cases (where in the Donepiņdi grant. Il practically does not differ from U), in the Vanapalli plates, the sign for Uh is generally distinguished from the sign for b by just such a separate semicircular line as above we have found to distinguish plı from p; compare in the Vånapalli plutes cgbháti,1. 3, Sumbhor=; 1. 4, súhlia, 1. 7, etc. Moreover it may be noted that in the inscription B. of Kataya-Vêma, above, Vol. IV. p. 320, in the bh of Bhimisvara in line 8, the distinguishing semicircular line has been changed into a downward stroke, so that the sign for bh looks exactly like the bh of the moderni Tolayı alphabet. 
In addition to the signs of the ordinary Sanskrit consonants, the Donepůņdi grant also contains the sign for the Dravidian !, e.g. in sunirmula, l. ll, and the sign for I, e.g. in éru, 1. 14. In the sign for the Ț of taruuita in line 49 the engraver erroneously has omitted the horizontal line in the interior of the letter. 
Regarding the signs of subscript consonants it may be noted that in the conjuncts 1197 and n.n the same sigo is used for both (the second) a and m, as in namaḥ, l. 1, and guishanna (n.na), 1.13. Attention may also perhaps be drawn to the form of the subscript l, e.g. in Biyajalli, 1. 47, and puțlu, 1. 53.-Of final consonants which are not joined with a following letter, oulyt occurs, in aranjayıct, l. 17, and dhácddnát, 1. 23, 
As regards medial vowels, I have already indicated that there is hardly any difference between the signs for i and i; compare e.g. gita-kirtih, 1. ð, and didhitin, 1. 27. In engraving the aksharu mi of kitum=ishte in line 21 the engraver has made a mistake, which, to judge from the impression, was subsequently corrected by him. Another mistake was made by him in engraving the akshara 10 at the end of line 15, as may be seen by a comparison of the proper sign for nu in finur=1920, L. 24, or the wo of Jaganobbagamdda in line 27 of the Vanapalli plates. 
That the plates, near the proper right margin of the first inscribed side of each plate, contain the numeral figures from 1 to 5, has been already stated.

? The akshara bha of this very word is reproduced in Prof. Bübler's Indische Palæographie, Table VIII, col. ir, No. 33, but without the characteristic senicircular line at the bottom, which is quite clear and distinct in the published platolithograph of the Vånapadli plates. The same colann contaius other similar errors which need not be specified bere. 
? The same practice is followed in rome very murh earlier inscriptions ; compare e.g, in the Satârâ plates of the Eastern Chalukya Pevarája Visuņuvardhana I, (Ind. Ant, Vol. XIX. p. 809, and Plate) sampamuak, le 4, and paurnnamdsyâri, 1. 13.-. It may be uoted that both in the Donepûndi grant and in the Vânapalli plates the conjunct inn is always wiitten by the sigu for ran.

A LIST OF THE 
INSCRIPTIONS OF NORTHERN INDIA 
FROM ABOUT A.D. 400. 
By Professor F. KIELHORN, C.I.E.; GÖTTINGEN. TN compliance with the request of several scholars who are interested in Indian epigraphy, I I publish herewith part of a list of Indian inscriptions, which primarily I had prepared for my own use only. What I offer at present, may be roughly described as a list of the inscriptions of Northern India, from about the end of the fourth century A.İ. Similar lists of the more numerous inscriptions of Southern India, and of the inscriptions before A.D. 400, are under revision and may be published hereafter, 
Witbin the limits indicated, this list gives, or is intended to give, all inscriptions of any importance that have been published, or noticed with details of their contents, in the periodicals and official volumes accessible to me, and it inoludes some unpublished inscriptions of which rubbings or impressions have been kindly presented to me from time to time by Drs. Burgess, Fleet, Führer, Hornle and Hultzsch, and by the late Sir A. Cunningham. I shall bo grateful to every one who will draw my attention to any inscription which may have been omitted. As it stands at present, the list deals with rather more than 700 inscriptions:1 about 250 coppel' plate inscriptions, and the rest, with one exception, inscriptions on stones and rocks. 
In arranging the list, I have been guided partly by the eras: according to which the inscriptions are dated, and partly by the localities where the originals were discovered. Thus Nos. 1-568 give the inscriptions dated (or, in some cases, supposed to be dated) according to the Mâlava-Vikrama era (1-328, marked. V.), the Saka era (346-386, marked S.), the Kalachuri. Chedi era (387-425, marked K.), the Gupta-Valabhi era (436-507, marked G. or Valabhi-s.), the Harsha era (528-547, marked H.), and the Newår erx (559-568, marked N.); together, generally, with those undated inscriptions the time of which may be approximately determined by reference to the inscriptions dated according to one of the eras mentioned (329-345, 426-435 508-527, and 548-558). Nos. 569-587 give the small number of inscriptions which are (or have, been taken to be) dated according to the Saptarshi era (509-574), the era of Buddha's Nirvana (575), the Lakshmanasêna era (576-578), and the Simba era (579-584), with references to three inscriptions which, dated according to other eras, also quote the corresponding years of the Hijra era, the " Bengali San," and the Ilahi era of the emperor Akbar (585-587). And Nos. 588.688 give the remaining inscriptions, which either coutain no date at all or are for the 
1 This pomber includes sowe inscriptions which are mentionod in footnotes only. Some inscriptions which came to my notice when part of this list res already in type are given at the end, under the head of Addenda. 
This is the iron pillar inscription No. 508. 
8 The list inclades all Indian inscriptions known to me which are dated according to the Saptarshi era, the era of Buddha's Nirvåņa, and the Malava-Vikraina, Kalachuri-Chêdi, Gupta-Valabhi, Harsha, Newâr, Lakshmanasena, Simba, and Gångėya eras. But it contains only 21 inscriptions dated exclusively according to the Suka era, and none which are dated according to the era of the Kaliyuga, and the Kollam and Chalakya-Vikram erle. Years of the twelve-ycars cycle of Jupiter Are quoted in the Gupta dates of Nos. 451, 453, 466 and 459, and in No. 522; years of the sixty-years cycle of Jupiter in only eleven (Vikrama) dates ; aud anka (reguel) years only in Nos, 367, 369, 370, and 671.

(Vol. V. 
most parti dated in regnal years, broadly arranged according to the tracts of country where they were found, from Rajputâna and the Pañjab on the west to Orissa and Gañjânn on the east coast of India. I am aware that a number of the inscriptions towards the end of the list, as well as others which are dated accorling to the Saka era, properly belong to Southern India, but bave given them here ou account of the counection of some of them with northern inscriptions. To draw an absolutely strict linc between the north and the south appeared to me as unnecessary as it would be impossible. 
On the iuforniation given under each number little need be said here. As far as I was able to do so, I have tried to state, not merely where an inscription has been discovered, but also where it is now. I have also indicated whether Plates of an inscription are available. When an inscription has been edited aeveral times, I generally have thought it sufficient to state where it has been published last. In the case of dated inscriptions, I have given throughout the original dates, and have added their European equivalents when they could be ascertained with confidence; moreover, I have shewn whether the numbers which may occur in a date are denoted by aumerical symbols or by numeral (decimal) figures. As regards other details, I have mostly conüned myself to recording the genealogy or line of succession (where it is given in the original) of the king or chief to whom an inscription belongs, and the names of the princes who ill's mentioned in connection with him or his predecessors; but, in the case of copper plutes, I have also given the names of the places from which the grants were issued, and, in the caso of prašastis, the names of their authors. 
I ventwe to hope that this list will be of some service both to these of my fellow students who are engaged in the publication of Indian inscriptions, and to any one who would wish to ascertain whether an inscription on stone or a copper-plato inscription, which he may meet with, is uew or has alrally attracted thy Doli ALUILD of sohnlars. To render the list more useful, the principal names that occur in it are giua in an Indes.

6 With the epoch which best suits the later Kalachari dates, the origiual dato would be oxpected to fall in A.D. 704-5, not in A.D. 705.6. 
1 This may be the intended date, but there are difficultios. Judging by the later Kalachuri dates, the original date would be expected to fall in AD. 735, not in A.1). 736. Besiiles, although in A,D. 736 the Karkata-surinkranti did take place during the 10th tithi of the bright liull of Aslaba, this tithi fell on Friday, the 22nd June, and the tithi which ended on Sunday, the 24th June, was the 12th of the bright half. [Accord ing to any calculations for all the years from Kaliyuga-samvat 8601 to 3925 expired, the date would work out quite correctly only for A.D. 576 and A.D.793.7

In (Kaliyuga-samvat 3741 expired=) A.D. 640-41, by the rules of mean intercalation, there was an intercalated month which might be called Pausha on the suppositions that it was calculated by the Brahma-siddhanta, and named according to the modern (not Brahmagupta's) rule for naming intercalated months, but wbich ordinarily would bo called Märgasira, (See Sewell and Dikshit's Ind.
