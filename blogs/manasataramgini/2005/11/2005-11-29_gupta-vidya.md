We stood before that great idol of pratya\~NgirA before the most holy
shrine of Tiruchengode. That is the idol filled with the power of
atharvaNa hR^idyA. When stands one before the deity one attains the most
high mantra of the devI.  
khaDUre .adhicha\~NkamAM kharvikAM kharvavAsinIm |  
ya udArA antarhitA gandharvApasarasashcha ye |  
sarpA itarajanA rakShAMsi ||

The most fierce one manifests with the appropriate bIjas added.

Indeed only when stand before her in that idol in Tiruchengode does the
mantra come to you. dhyAna must completely internalize her and then the
mantra may be realized at any time.
