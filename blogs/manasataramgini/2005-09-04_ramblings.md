Today I was at the Philadelphia museum- a few childhood dreams of mine
were finally fulfilled. I got an opportunity to examine the following
skulls and skeletons at some length:

1\) The skull Eoraptor  
2\) The skull of Hererrasaurus  
both of which are amongst the earliest theropods.  
The skeletons of  
3\) Dromeosaurus and  
4\) Saurornithoides,  
two deinonychosaurs close to the origins of birds  
5\) The second skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex (this specimen has a better
preserved fore limb that allowed me study carpal and ungual
morphology)  
6\) The skull of the abelisaur Majungatholus atopus from the Cretaceous
beds of Madagascar. I was able to understand the cranial ornamentations
for the first time at length. There is no substitute to seeing a real
skeleton.

7\) The fragmentary remains of Dryptosaurus. This was a great moment for
me. Dryptosaurus is an engimatic theropod dinosaur with large had claws.
It was clearly dominant in the early Cretaceous in USA but was largely
mysterious in terms of affinities. However, recent analysis suggests
that it may by a lineage of tyrannosauroids that moved in direction very
different from the classical forms that reduced their fore claws. I got
to compare it with the fragmentary remains of another early branching
new tyrannosaur Appalachiosaurus montgomeriensis. All in all the
evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs still remains to be written.

8\) Giganotosaurus- the largest theropod known to date. This was the
first time I stood before the skeleton of this gigantic
carcharodontosaur. I was able to compare various elements with
Allosaurus (which lies at the Smithsonian here) and Acrocanthosaurus and
get a feel for the carcharodontosaurine radiation with the allosauroids.
It is clear that the path to these large carcharodontosaurs lay via a
medium-sized English predator Neovenator. This implies that split
between the allosaurs proper and the the two clade with Acrocanthosaurus
and the carcharodontosaurs occured early. It also showed how
Yangchuanosaurus and Sinraptor were a closer to the
Neoventor-carcharodontosaur lineage than the allosaurs.

Moving on to other dinosaurs, I got to examine two ceratopsians I had
not previously studied in “person”:  
9\) Chasmosaurus typified by a gigantic shield  
10\) Avaceratops, a smaller form more primitive than the above form,  
but far more derived than the primitive Protoceratops. Comparing it  
with the basal Leptoceratops, Protoceratops, and the derived  
Triceratops I could get a good feel for the evolutionary developments  
in Ceratopsia.  
11\) I also got to examine a delightful skeleton of Pachycephalosaurus  
and understand the architecture of the dome and facial spikes.  
Moving to hadrosaurs  
12\) Corythosaurus was examined a length and observations made on its
gait and posture. The most striking were the ossified tendons supporting
the entire caudal vertebra series.  
13\) The skull of Lambeosaurus was examined and the two crests studied
(See attached photo).  
14\) The limbs of Hadrosaurus.  
15\) The limbs of the Sauropod Diplodocus  
16\) The fore limb of Supersaurus another gigantic diplodocid sauropod.

These give a sense of size of Supersaurus (mind boggling) and the single
non-hoof claw of the sauropods, which was clearly used in defense
against the theropods.

17\) A femur of Triceratops punctured by a Tyrannosaurus. The extant to
which the Tyrannosaur teeth could penetrate hard bone was revealed,
showing the tremendous force they might have applied to get the teeth
in.

Then moving to non-dinosaurian reptiles  
18\) There was a good skeleton of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus that I got
to see for the first time

There were also a few other fossils collected by the early American
president Thomas Jefferson, including the ground sloth Megalonyx that he
described on his own in a paper. But the complete understanding of the
sloths had to wait till Darwin’s discovery of Mylodon and his remarkable
evolutionary work by comparing it Megatherium.  
….  
Near by there was another museum with material of the early American
scientist Ben Franklin who studied electricity. Many of his devices can
be experimented with in the Museum.

Of course all this has to be done in the unpleasant company of one who
utterly lacks any interest in such matters and the consequences of it
need no further elaboration. I was reminded of the great German
Alexander von Humboldt, who described who on occasion he had make do
with the company of brutish Spanish padres who could hardly understand
his scientific explorations.
