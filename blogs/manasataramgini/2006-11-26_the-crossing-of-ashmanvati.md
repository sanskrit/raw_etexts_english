In the days of our earliest memories we were transfixed by the sight of
that part of the sky which has inspired and continued to inspire all
discerning beholders. We drew that little cluster, the mothers of our
god, and the three stars in a line, which form the arrow of The god. All
this got imprinted in our minds. Over the ages the language of myth has
preserved the passage of time through this region of the sky and beyond.
Tilak first and de Santillana and von Dechend thereafter (the latter two
are possibly plagiarists of Tilak, who failed to cite him appropriately)
realized some of the underlying celestial secrets. We continue this
journey of exploration through this part of the heavens.

We first briefly return those hymns of sauchika agnI, which is verily a
repository of astronomical lore connected with precession in the typical
language of the vedic mantra shAstra (as a tangential aside, those who
understand the vedic mantra shAstra code, even if only in fragments,
will see the concealment so typical of the tantric mantra shAstra that
followed):

sAdhvI makar devavItiM no adya yaj\~nasya jihvAma vidAma guhyAm |  
sa AyurAgAt surabhirvasAno bhadrAmakar devahUtiM no adya || RV 10.53.3

Today he made the food-offerings to the deva-s effective;we have now
found the secret tongue of the yaj\~na. Today he has come, robed in
good-scents, extending life, and had made our oblations to the deva-s
effective. \[This celebrated mantra is recited in the midst of the long
chant “you O agni, who is rudra …” when the fire is brought to the main
altar borne in a pot by the adhvaryu. The brAhmaNa text of the
taittirIyas explains that the mouth the sacrifice, which is the year, is
the equinotical colure, which was then in kR^ittikA. Hence, by analogy
the finding of the tongue of the sacrifice is finding of the new
position of the equinotical colure, which is agni, after it had
precessed from its old position. This was alluded to in the [first
sauchIka agnI
hymn](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/21/the-path-of-fire/)\]

Spinning the thread, follow the sun in the heaven, guarding the stellar
path that was found \[made\] due to knowledge. Weave the regular pattern
praised in the sacred rites, become manu, bring forth the heavenly
folks. \[In the kaushItaki tradition of the R^igveda the hotar chants a
mantra on the mahAvrata and viShuvAn days in which it is said that the
sun is a spider that spins a web going six month north and six months
south. The spinning in the first half of the mantra alludes to this,
while the weaving in the second half alludes to the coming of days and
nights in a regular pattern, which is also mentioned in the kaushItaki
mantra- KB 19.3. The gods are asked to watch upon the path of the sun
that was earlier “disrupted” by precession\]

10.53.7

O soma drinkers, fasten that which is to the tied, prepare the ropes and
decorate. Bring forth the 8 seats of the chariot and with which the gods
lead forth that which we love. \[The deeper meaning of this mantra is
still shrouded in mystery- e.g. why eight seats? Yet the axle and ropes
here allude to the world frame being set in place\]

10.53.8

ashmanvatI flows by. Hold tight together, keep your self erect and cross
\[the river\], friends. There let us leave that which is not good, and
we cross over to that which is auspicious. \[This is the single most
important element of the sauchIka agni hymns in terms of a date. It
clearly mentions crossing of the river ashmanvatI to the other side
where the auspicious lies. This means that the new equinoctial position
laid on the other side the ashmanvatI- the heavenly river the Milky Way.
I prepared a simulacrum of the skies that inspired this hymn using the
Cartes du Ciel program, the best freeware for the purpose. One can note
that if the Milky was crossed by the equinoctial colure as indicated in
the picture, the period was likely in a period after 4000 BC, possibly
around 3700 BC by which the crossing was definitely over\].

The final mantra of these series while extremely obscure gives a clue of
what the period might have been:  
garbhe yoShAm adadhur vatsam Asany apIchyena manasota jihvayA |  
sa vishvAhA sumanA yogyA abhi siShAsanirvanatekAra ijjitim || RV
10.53.11  
The hymns appears to state that the R^ibhu-s \[not named directly but
indicated by brahminical tradition\] secretly placed the young lady in
“womb” and the calf in the jaw. Now this calf if the sun at the New
Year, the jaw, as de Santillana and von Dechend show, is Taurus. Thus we
have the crossing of the Milky Way, asmanvatI to enter Taurus. The yoShA
being placed in the garbha is more obscure. Possibly it means Virgo, the
yuvati being deposed from her place at the top of the ecliptic and being
moved to the descent \[Tilak mentions the Virgo full moon in the
solsticial year beginning at an early era\].

But the same celestial sector also appear more dramatically in the
mythosphere as the place where rudra slaughters prajApati with his
3-fold arrow. The related issues we shall narrate if we get a chance
later and then return to complete the tale of andhaka where an element
of the astronomical language of myth survives. But for now we conclude
with a much later litany to show how firmly planted these events were in
Hindu thought.

puShpandanta’s shiva mahimna:

The heavenly stream (the Milky Way) envelops the sky, with its beauty
enhanced by the illumination of the foam by the groups of stars. It
forms a ring around the universe making it look like an island. The same
current is a mere trickle on you head. This itself shows the greatness
of your celestial form.

Then again:

O lord, once prajApati was attracted to his own daughter. When she fled
becoming a red deer he took the form of a stag and chased her. You as a
hunter, with a bow in hand \[went after him\]. Struck by your arrow and
greatly terrorized he is in the sky \[as a constellation\].

In the picture above all these scenes are seen on the celestial dome.
