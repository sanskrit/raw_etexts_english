## CXCI

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8504e8191.pdf)* )

*To Swami Turiyananda*

6 PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,  
PARIS,  
*August, 1900*.

DEAR BROTHER HARI,

Now I am staying on the sea-coast of France. The session of the Congress
of History of Religions is over. It was not a big affair; some twenty
scholars chattered a lot on the origin of the Shâlagrâma and the origin
of Jehovah, and similar topics. I also said something on the occasion.

My body and mind are broken down; I need rest badly. In addition, there
is not a single person on whom I can depend; on the other hand so long
as I live, all will become very selfish depending upon me for
everything. . . . Dealing with people entails constant mental
uneasiness. . . . I have cut myself off by a will. Now I am writing to
say that nobody will have sole power. All will be done in accordance
with the view of the majority. . . . If a trust-deed on similar lines
can be executed, then I am free. . . .

What you are doing is also Guru Maharaj's work. Continue to do it. Now I
have done my part. Don't write to me any more about those things; do not
even mention the subject. I have no opinions whatever to give on that
subject. . . .

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Convey my love to all.
