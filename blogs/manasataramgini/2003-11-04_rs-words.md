title = "Râ€™s words"

+++
Some years ago R and me were lying on the grass following our quarry, a
goodly specimen of Menemerus, that kept saltating in search of its
quarry. Then our eyes caught sight of a Salticus specimen that was
capturing a small earwig and we kept following it to observe the
process. R then moved on to a Marpissa mucosa, while I drifted away
towards a gorgeous Icius. At the that point for some reason we paused. R
pulled my collar and pointed to a Calotes soulfully seated on a bough. I
was a bit surprised and asked: So what. She then said: Did you think
over my words last night.  
  
I said: Yes, but could only feel the fragile bliss shattered. We are
definitely in some delusion. Sometimes I cannot believe that I could be
that good.  
  
She said: Grab it when it comes. The bliss already passed when we set at
the outdoor table in the restaurant looking at the terrapin.  
  
I said: Give me an year.  
  
She said: Look at the lizard there. A day will come when you will feel
like it. It may be worse, you could feel like that Argiope in the dark
corner.  
  
I now realize that those words were prophetic.
