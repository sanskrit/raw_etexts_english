## CXCVII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

THE MATH, BELUR

*13 May 1901*

DEAR MOTHER,

I reached Calcutta yesterday. This morning arrived your letter
containing three cheques for my cousin. They shall reach her regularly.

I have not had any letter from Joe \[Miss Josephine MacLeod\] from
Japan, but several I find awaiting me from on board steamer. She also
sends me a newspaper cutting to be sent to Professor Geddes. I enclose
it in this letter and expect you to direct it to Prof. Geddes.

Saradananda has been three weeks in Darjeeling, where he has improved
greatly. I wish he will remain some time longer there. Mr. Bannerjy is
the kindest of hosts.

Mrs. Sevier is in London at 2, Maisemore Mansions, Canfield Gardens,
London, N.W.

You are right: my experiences are bringing about calmness — great
calmness.

Mrs. Patterson and children are off to Europe. General \[C. B.
Patterson\] is alone and very desirous that I would call. I will the
next time I go to town.

My cousin and mother and the rest send love, and my eternal love you
know always.

Ever your son,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. All love and blessings for Margot \[Sister Nivedita\].
