OM namo akulavIrAya

We beheld him, he who stands with the trident in the midst of the blaze
of the dissolution of the universe. We beheld the 62 taijasa mayUkha-s
shooting forth\! We worshiped nandin at ODDiyAna, kArttikeya at
pUrNagiri and vighna at kAmarUpa.

O geneatrix, I worship in your svAdhiShThana, saMvarta presiding over
the fiery realm, and also that great samayA, whose glance moist with
mercy initiates the cooling winter to the worlds when his (saMvarta)
wrathful eruption \[fire from the 3rd eye\] burns the worlds.

The core of the samayA-kula doctrine is provided by the saMvartAmaNDala
sUtra-s with which the principal tantra-s of the pashchimAmnAya open.
The saMvartAmaNDala sUtra-s of the kubjikA-mata tantra are shorter than
those of the ShaTsAhasra-saMhitA, hence I provide the latter – the
bR^ihat-saMvartAmaNDala sUtra-s. I had a deep discussion of these with
R1’s father who provided me with a text of them. A printed version was
published by the late Dutch scholar Jan Schroterman using 3 Nepali
manuscripts. R1’s father and his father had access to multiple Nepali
manuscripts, which might have even perished since. They also studied the
commentary the saMvartArtha-prakAsha which deals with the bR^ihat
version. R1’s father explained that the commentarial tradition records 9
human teachers of the doctrine of different varNa-s. This choice of nine
of the teachers seems to be an attempt to keep in line with the
bhairava’s name navAtman.

brAhmaNa teachers:  
trivikrama deshika, a sAmavedin from oDDiyAna.  
dAmodara deshika, a R^igvedin from the Konkans.  
govinda from mathurA  
vishNusharman from kAshI.  
kShatrIya teacher:  
udayarAja from Orissa  
vaishya teacher:  
dehila, a merchant from Andhra (shrIshaila)  
shUdra teachers:  
bAhila from Assam  
sehila from Kashmir  
mAhila, a liquor-store owner from the kundApura sector of oDDiyAna

An interesting biographical tale is narrated regarding trivikrama
deshika: He was born in a learned Brahmin family in oDDiyAna, where he
learned the sAmaveda and as well as prayoga-s from all other veda-s and
became a notable scholar. trivikrama was sent as an ambassador to Shri
Lanka, where he was converted to the theravAda bauddha school. He then
became a governor of a Lankan province and began persecuting Hindus with
much vigor. Once he encountered a mantravAdin named unmanishanAtha in a
graveyard performing sAdhanA. He tried to wake him up but failed.
Finally, that mantrin awoke and looked at trivikrama and he had a sight
of the glory of samayA and aghora (as in saundarya-lahari 34/39/41). He
returned to the Hindu fold and became a teacher of the kula doctrine. He
was attacked by pAShaNDa mantra-vAdin-s who followed the doctrine of
shuddhodhana-putra at kAnyakubja, but he decimated them using the
khAdakAstra mantra combined with the nR^isiMha or the trivikrama mantra.
He then assumed the name vyomAnandanAtha.

In both the kubjikAmata and ShaTsAhasra saMhitA the sUtra-s are worked
into verse approximating the sragdharA Chandas. I have marked the
individual sUtra boundaries with ‘..’
