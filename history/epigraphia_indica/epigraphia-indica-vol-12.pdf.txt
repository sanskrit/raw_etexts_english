ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS. 
Vol. XI. Pages 3, 6. A communication from Mr. H. Krishna Sastri has led to my recognizing an improvement in my treatmont of lino 7 of the Dövagiri inscription. I havo read thore: 
Sålntivarmama novarado maryyūday-ige, ato. I found in the second of these words the instrymoutal singulur of nevara as a longer form of ndrörit, vēr, 'straightness, proprioty, pleasantness.' And I translated :-"Sāntivarman, whilo govorning tho Banayāsi twolves thousand with rectitude and according to established customs," ote. Mr. Krishna Sastri has reminded me of the expression peldose maryyādeyəriya, " with the groat rivor (the Krishạá) as the boundary," in the Molgund inscription of lañchaladeva, ante, vol. 6, p. 279, lino 5; and, proposing to read the first syllable aftur [Si]ntivarmnu as bhē ivstend of nē, ho ban suggested that we should find hore the namo Bhëvarade as meaning possibly tho rivor Bhimarathi, the Bhima. That, however, is not exactly the case. Tho reference is to the river Wirdî, which is mentionod as Varadi in the Ailolo inscription of A.D. 034-35, ante, vo), 0, 1, 5, lino 19. 
Bannwisi is on the north bank of the Warda : and tho river flows about two wiles on the north, of Devagori, ani so into tho Tuñgablıadrā some twenty-two milos farther on to the past. In the Doyagēri inscription we should read :--[Sū]ntivarmmano Varade maryyadıy=ago, and translato :-"Säntivurman himself, while govorning the Banayasi twelve-thou and with tho Varada ns the boundary," etc. The meaning is that he way ruling those parts of the Banavāsi provinco which lay to the south of tho Warda : and the other rcvords (sco pp. 4, 5) of tho Matúra family, to which he belonged, uro all front places which aro in aglocment with this. The suggestion of nērarı as a louger form of nera, =ner, is of course to be cancelled.-J. F. t.

This inscription is engraved on four copper-plates measuring about 5 inchos in hrvadt) and about 2 inchos in height. Tho two outermost platos are inscribed only ou their innor silo, but the two middlo onog on both sides. The plates were discovered whilo ploughing at Rāgölu near Chicacole in the Ganjam district. Thoy word rescued by their prosupt owner, Mr. G. Ramadas, B.A., Toncher, Mrs. A. V. N. College at Vizagapatam, when they wore abont to be melted down into coppar. As the inscription is so much damaged that perfect impressions auto difficult to obtain, my late lamented friend Rai Bahadur V. Venkayyal sont mo the original plates about which he added tho following remarks --- 
"Each plate has a ring-hole on its left side about 5 inch from the loft margin. Thero was no ring or scal when the platos woro brought to mo originally. But when they were sent to mo a second time, they were accompanied by an oval seal (14 inch by 14 inch nearly) soldered on a brokon ring. The seal bears two linos of writing (in the alphabet of the plates), of which tho second may be Sak[t]i-varmma[nah ?)." 
I may add that the beginning of the first line shows truces of the letters mahürii. Conse quoutly the complete legend of tho soal may have boon :- i

No. 2.-BRIHATPROSHTHA GRANT OF UMAVAKMAN. 
By Professor E. Holtzsch, Ph.D.; HALLE (SAALE).

• Like the Rāgola platos of Saktivarman (No. 1 abovo), the copper-plates bearing tho subjoined inscription helong to Mr. G. Ramadas of Vizagapatam and were sont by him to the Jato Rui Buhadur V. Vonkayya, who forwarded to mo two sets of ink-impressions of them. Mr. Ruunadas writos that the plates “ were obtained from a smith in the Palakonda tåluku. Nothing moro is known of them." Mr. Vonkayyu sent me tho following description of the original platos: 
“Throe copper-plates of four sides. Average length 7%; hoight 37" (at the marginn) and 3?" (in the middle). Tho platos vero held togother by a ring (cat by me for taking inupressions), which appears to have been twisted out of its original shape, which was probably circular. The highest diameter now is 5. And the lowest 41". Tho ends of the ring are secured at the bottom of an oval soal measuring 24" by 3". Tho depression of tho soul bears in relief a legend in four lines, of which tho last soems to be ra []muvarmasya, Tho other flirto lines are not distinct." 
To judge fron the impressions, the inscription is much damagod; hat, with the exception of the pamo of the writor in l. 16, every word can be made out with the help of tho contoxt. The alphabet is of un carly Southern type. The jihvdmültya is used in l. 1, the upadhrániya in l. 7, and the numerical symbols 20 and 30 in 1. 15. Tho language is Sanskrit prose (with three verses of Vyusa quoted in il. 11-15), • 
Both the alphabet and tho phraseology of the grant closely rosomblo those of the Komarti 
andavarman. platos of the Mahīrāja Chandavarman. This king may have bolonged to th 
This king may have bolonged to the same family as Mahärájömavarman, the donor of the subjoined grant. For both kings issued their edict from Simhapura or Sihapura and boru the opithets " lord of Kalinga" and “dovoted to the foot of (his) fathor." The second portion of the dosignation Mahārājómavarman probably contains the word Umū, one of the names of Siva's consort, the final vowel of which has buen shortenoil in accordance with Panini, VI, 3, 63. 
Thu inguription records that Umavarman granted the village of Bribatprðshtha (l. 2) to tho Brāhmann Haridatta (l. 4). This person may be identical with another Ilaridatta, who is montioned in the last line of the inscription as the father of its writer. Tho date of the grant foll into the year 30 (1. 15) (of the king's reign). 
As stated before, Chandavarman and Umavarmnn resided at Simhapura or Sihapura. According to Singhalese inscriptions the two 'kings Nissankamalla and Sähasamalla, tho second of whom ascendod the throne in A.D. 1200,8 word sons of tho Kalinga king Goparija of Simbapura, Tho Buddhist chronicle Mahavainsa (chapter 59, verse 29) states that Tilskasuudarí, a quoen of Vijayabāku I. (who is roportod to have reigned from A.D. 1054 to 1109),+ was a princess of Kalinga, and that three relatives of heps, one of whom was named Madhukannava, came to Coylon from Sihapura (id. verse 46). Simhapura is perhaps 
identical with the modern Siágupuram between Chicacole and Narasannapeta.

No. 3. THE TARPANDIGHI GRANT OF LAKSHMANA SENA. 
By R. D. BANERJI, JL.A. 
Iu 1875 Mr. Westmacott published an account of a copper-plato discovered in the village of Tarpandighi in tho district of Dinajpur. This was the first inscription of Lakabmapaséna discovered until then. Mr. Westmacott's article was accompanied by two lithography of drawings made from this copper-plate. The inscription has pot viuco been published with mecha nical fucsimiles. It now ippoar's that the pluto bolonged originally to Sir William LoFleming Robinson, Bartı, of Hillesley Houso, Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucoatorshiro. It was lont to Mr. Westmacott for publication by the ownor. The plate has recently been purchased from Sir Erdost Robinson, the nephew of the owner, by tho Dresyiya Sahitya Parishad. The inscription is inoised on a singlo thick plato of copper measuring 13" x 11" with a projootion of 33" in dougth, to which is attached the royal soal by means of a copper bolt. Prinsop in his paper on the Bükorganj graut of Kosavasona has reforred to the curious figurd which is to be found on Soua grunts. 
Another copper-plate inscription of Lakshmaņasona is the Angliya grant originally published i & now defunct Bungali periodical called Aitihisika Chitra (of Rāmpur Boåliš in the Rájobāli District of Bengal). Tho author of that paper made out the sadhana of the figure which forms the royal soal of the Sõna Kings of Bengal. In the Bakerganj grant of Kosava. 
This is a Pråkrit forin of Sibapura, % Juurnal Beng. As. Soc., Vol. XLIV, P. I, pp. 11 f. 
8 Ibidem, Vol. VII, p. 43. Tho uame of the donor Grems to be Kefanasina 18 read by Priasop and not Vibrarūpasina as supposed by Babu Nagendra Nath, ibidem, Vol. LXV, P. 1, p. 8. 
No. 3.) 
THE TARPANDIGHI GRANT OF LAKSMANA SUNA. 
gona tho seal is distinctly roforred to by tho expression Sadasivu-mudray muruyilvi.' The author has found that in the Mahānirtäna-Tantra the deity named Sadasiva is actually montioued. The god is describod as follows (Ullāsa xiv)? :- . 
nun 
"Ho is woaring a tiger's skin; the sacroi thread is made of snakes; his body, is coverod with ashes and ho wonrs ornaments mado of snukos. Ho has firo faces of the following colours -smoke colonred, yellow, red, white, and black, He has three @yos and his head is covered with matted locks. He holds the Gangos (on his boad); ho has ton arms; his forehond is beautifiod by the moon. In his loft hands ho holds a skull, fire, a 10osc, a bow and an axe aud in his right hands trident, a thundorboll, sa olophant goad, an arrow and (the granting of) a bool. He is pfuisod by all gods and excellent munism His liont look in replen dont iu granting the highest bliss; he has the appajranco of ydow, juswine, and moon; he is resplendent with the bull ay his sont; he is overywhere day and night praised by siibellus, gandharcus, and apsaruses, the lover of Umā, the sole refugo, the dear," 
Tho Tarpandighi grant is oxactly similar to tho Annlivī grant, qui tho first novon voraus of the two grants are idontical. So far as I can say, the third grant of Lakshmanasõna, which was found by Pandit Rumagati Nyüyaratna and to which I have referred in my article on the Mūdhūinagar plate of Lukshmanusöna, is similar to these grants. Unfortunately tho inscription cannot be traced at present. The verece of the Madhăinagar grant (do not resemble 1 those of any of tho other throu grants of Lakshmaqasina. 
Tho inscription opods with an invocation to ihe god Vishņu. The first two verses contain an enlogium of tho moon, from whom thu Sõna kings are said to have been descended. This is followed by tho usual genealogy of the Sina kings from Hemantosēna down to Lakshmana sõna. As I have already observed, the first boven versoe ngreo outirely with thono of tho Auuliyā grant. Tho next two versos aro identical with vv. 8 to 10 of the Anuliyā grunt. 
The subjoined grant van ingned from tho victorious camp at Vikramapura and recordis tho grant of the village of Vēlahiahți in tho Varēndri country in the Paundravardhana Inukti by the Paramośvara-Paranavaishnilva-Puramabhal kiraka-Janarūjilhirajie Lakshma nabēnadēva, who meditated on the feot of the Mulirajiidhiruju. Vallalasēnudēva, in the third yoar of his reign (equivalont to the third year of tho Lakshmanasena oru 1122 A.D.), to & Brahmung named īsvaradiva-Sarman of the Blaradvaja gölra and student of the Kauthuma brunch of the Samavoda. 
ui 
The doneo was tho great grandson of Hutāšanadiva-Sarman, the grandson of Markru döyndēva-Sarman and the son of Lakshmidharadovit-Sarman. His priivars were Bhunaderit, Argirasa, and Barhaspatya. The grant was made as dakshina on the occasion of the vilt

No. 4.-CHATSU INSCRIPTION OF BALADITYA. 
By D. R. BHANDARKAR, M.A.; POONA. 
This inscription, which is published horo for the first time, was discoverod as early as 1873, by A. O. L. Carlleyle, assistant of Sir Alexander Cunningham. It was found at Chatsur the principal town of a tahsil of the same name, Jaipur Stato, and about twenty-six miles south of the Jaipur City. It is referred to by him in the Archeologioal Survey Report, Vol VI, p. 116, in the following words : " I found a Katila inscription of twenty-six lines on a broken black stone built into the side wall of the stops leading down into a great tank at Chatsu, at the bottom of which thie inscription was found about seventy or eighty years ago." The tank here mentioned is no doubt the one looally known as the Goloriy taldo, but the inscription stone when I was at Chåţst at the close of Deoembor 1909, was in t wall of the dilapidated tomple of Raghunathji in the immediate neighbourhoorl of the fight of steps.

.. The inscription is engraved on a slab of black stone, and consists not of twenty-six, ug Carlleyle says, but of, twenty-sovun lidos, which cover a space of about 2' 111" browl by 1'41" high. It is broken in throo parts about one foot from the commencement of lipos 9 and '10. Besidus, & portion of the stone has pooled off near tho lower corner of the proper left side. The size of tho lettors is larger in lines 1-20 and smallor in linea 21-27. It is largest in line 20. Tito characters are of the northern type of alphabet, approximately belonging to the tenth century. They include the somewbat rare forms of jh in Rajjhāin, line 18; pff, e.g. in ydohna-, line 6 ; and of ri, 0.g. in vår-maytin; 1. 1. Attention may also be drawn to the curious forms of ph,.g. in phanina), l. 3, and tho subscript t, c.y. in man: adhivasa.gaity=ktan, l. 2. The letter y occurs in two forms; tho ordinary ono may bu noticeri, 0.9. in -viprayāya., 1, 3, and the other ono in, e.g. vähint-pariyalaj, I. 18, or Suyrivada, 1. 19, in which case it can easily be mistakon for . The signs for the ciphers 5 and 7 inciserl in lines 4-5 and of tho avagraha oocurring e.g. in l. 4, Aro worthy of note. The language is Sanskrit, bnt is frequently anything but grammatical. Almost the whole fault in this respect may lie with the person who copiod thu insoription ou the stono previons to its being ongravod. But the composer of the prasasti is certainly responsible for the grammatically inadınissiblo word vil bî) mvi(mbi)tán, undoubtedly mistako for vi(bi)invi(mbi)lani, in l. 3. The word vivaha is aged in l. 7 apparently in thu sonso of “one whose vehicle is tho bird”, referring, of course, to Vishnu. Excepting the initial words [O in na]mah and the closing words from utkirnni to samvat, the whole of the record is in verse, and, curiously enough, the firet twenty two vorses ouly aro noinbered. In roapoct of orthography tho following points may be noticed: (1) the lottor b is throughoat donotod by the sigu for v; (2) ¢ is invariably doublod in conjunction with a following r; (3) a consonant is, as allowed by tho rules of grammar, doubled in conjunction with a preceding r, bh only being not doubled ; (4) ihri is uscd twice, in 11. 19 and 21 instead of the correct nyhri ; (5) -dushkchi7- is written in l. 11 instead of luhlha; (6) the letter & is frequently employed instead of s, though ouco $ is used instead of 8, rix. in - kamayah, 1. 22. 
After the iuitial words Om namah the inscription opens with obeisance to the goddess Sarasvati (v. 1), an invocation of blousings from the god Maruri (v8. 2-5). Verso 6 introduces the family of Guhila, and the verse following states that in this family flourished one Bhartfipatta, who was like Ramn endowod with both priostly and martial qualities (brahna-kshatrinvita). Rūma here roforred to is obviously Purasarama, and what the verge intonds saying is that just as Parasurama was a Brihmaņa by casts but did tho daties of a Kshatriya, Bhartsipatta also was a Bråbmaņa by extraction but displayed martial energy; in other words, Bhartsipatta Was & Brahmakshatra, i.e. what is vow known as Brahmakshatri. His son was Isänabhata (v. 8), and Tsunabhata's sou wa Upendrabhata (v. 9). From the latter sprang Gubila, and from him Dhanika (ve. 10-11). He is, I think, idontical with the Dhanika of the inscription now deposited in the Victoria Ball, Udaipur, but originally fogod at Dabok in Méwår. It begins with Sai 407 Bhadrapada-sudi 8 asmiin(n) di[va]sé Paramabhatļāraka-Mahārājadhirāja. Paramétvara-Sri-dDhavalappadeve-pravedha(rdha)māna-rājye | Guhile-puttråņam Sri dDhanikasy=Opabhujyamdndyan Dabavagarttāyān, etc. If the date 407 bo referred to the Gupta era, it booomes equivalent to A.D), 725. This agrees with the charactors of the inscrit. tion, whiob can not be earlier than the eighth, nor later than the ninth, contnry. I have elsewhero said that Dhavalappadova, the páramount sovereigu hero mentioned, is the same as the king Dhavala of the Maurya dynasty referred to in the Kansavim inscription of A.D.

738.1 Dutnika war succeeded by kis son Auka, and the latter by his son Krishnaria (vs. 12-13). Krislinarăja's son was Samkaragaman, who conquered Bhata, king of the Ganda. country, and made a present of this kingdom to his overlord (vs. 14-16). Can this Bhnţa bo Sarapin of the Pila lynasty, who, according to Cunningham, Was A son of Dovapāla, and according to Mr. V. A. Smith,' tho samo na Vigrahapala I. ? Sarnkaragann'a qucon was Yajja whú yan a slevotee of Siva (v. 17), and from lier be had a son nained Earsharāja (v. 18), who is called a driju, which, in inscriptions of this period, so far as my knowledge goos, denotos a Brühmnia only. Ho conquered kings in the north, and presented horses to Bhoja, who, I tbink, must ho Bhoja I. (AD), 843-882) of the imperial Pratihäre dynasty (v. 19). He married a prioccan named Sillā (v. 20), and had from lor a son called Guthile (v. 21). Vorse 22 saye that de produced the impression that he was Guljla I., come to life again to destroy bis foes, and the next vorso inforins nu that with excllent horses from the sca-const he vanquished the Gauda king and levied tributo from princes in the uast. He married Rajjhā, daughtor of tlo Pramära Vallabhuraja (v. 24). Thoir son wag Bhatta (v. 25), who lod an expedition of conquest against kings of the south, (v. 26). Apd married Purāśã, anughtor of one Viruka (v. 27). The inside of their marriage wis Bälāditya, Bālärka or Bõlabhānu (v. 28). Voraes 29-32 bestow nothing but conventioa: pruike on hin. Vorse 3:} tolls us that he married Rattavii, dilugh!or of the Chūhamina king Sivarāja, who is eulogised in the verso following. From her Bäläilitya hait three sone, mis. Vallabharaja, Vigraharāja, find Dēvarāja (v. 35). In commemoration of saltavá who had diod, Bilāditya, wo are informod, orected a temple to Morari, who sito probably in ocoupied by the templo of Raghunatha, where the inscription was found when I visited Chilva (v. 30). Verse 37 exprosses & wish for the permanenco of the temple. The next verne states that the prusaati was composed by one Bhānu, son of Chbitta, a kuranikt by onsto, and a Vaishnava by roligion. The prisusti was ongraved by tho sülrudhira Bhila, aon of Rujuka. This is followed by the word Sainvat without, however, the actual #specification of tho dute. But though no dato is given, there can be little doubt that it is to be assigned to the tonth century. 
The family, to which Biliditya belonged, is called in verse 6, &A we havo seen, Gubilasya vamen; in othor words he was a Guhilot. So far we have only known one Guhilot dynasty, time that reigning sometinuos ut. Nāgabrada (Nāgdā), sometimes at Āghātapura (Ahad), and biometimes at Chitrakūta (Chitor). This is tho celebrated dynusty to which the Ranās of Möwas claim to belong. But it now appears that thore was another Guhilot family roling over a territory extending from Chāui in Saipur to Dabok in Udaipur. The capital of this dynasty is not known. Probably it was Dhavagarti, 1,. Dhod iu the Jahājpar district, Mówår. Reminiscences of this fainily are still existent at Châted. The local traditions have still prcbcryod the couplot 
Rană chhoda Chāļsū jo chay 80. la "The Riņā has forsaken Chåtatt Whoover wants may take it." 
This shows that Chătuit had at one time boon held by the Gabilots. Again, the tank where the inscription stone was found, is called Gölērdu taliv, Goleráv obviously is a corruption of Gubilarāja, and the name shows that the tank was originally constructed by a prince of this dynasty called Gulilarāja.. This may be either Guhila 1. or Gubila II.

It has now been, by the kind permission of His Highness tho Mahārāja of Jodhpar, sent to tho Ajmer Museum. The atop-well, with which our inscription was originally connected, was, in course of time, buriod underground and it has,

(VOL. XII. 
The inscription covers & space of 2' 1' broad by I' T}" high, and contains 33 likes of writing · to which may be added tho two lines incisod on each side of the stono, thus making a total of 85. The average size of the lotters is ". The oharacters aro of the northern class of: alphabets which were prevalent in those days. It is curion, that the number of the first verso alopo las been ongravod in the sixth part, while those of the following two have been omitted. It mny also be noted that the 8th verse of the second part is written half only. Tho languago is Sanskrit and is grammatically inacourato in some places, Rules of stymology and syntax have been violated, e.g. wrong saindhi in sasar Alavadino (1. 12); wrong parasmainida in zirajuti (1. 22), the correct form virdjate not saiting the metre, eto. Instances of wrong metro sro also not wanting, 8.g., ubhuyar-kula-visuelhenu (l. 23). Here are nino letters instead of eight as required for oaob prida of an Anushtabh verse. The text to in vetso excepting four lines, viz, 11. 30 and 31 in tho body of the inscription, wherein the date is given, and the two lines in the margin. Tho prašiusts is composed up to verso 35 by dikshita Kānachandra, apparently a Jaina, (1, 29), add the Intter portion by a Gauda Kayastha Dandi (lino on the left margin). The following orthographical peculiaritios may be noticed. Rales of para-savarna have not at all beon observed. Letters following havo not been doubled in all places, 6.g. sarvvärlha (1.3) where ~ has been doubled but got th; tomurair=bhukta (1.7), bere bk has not been doublod; -schir=nripa. (1.9), -Karnāla- (1. 11), .eto. The palatal is has been con founded with the dental s; u has been used for 7 throughout, and p has dotaetimes wrongly been engraved for y, e.g. rumpa for ramyā (1. 3). 
The inscription is divied into six parts, and it is worthy of notico that the letter chha has been engraved at the end of each to indicate the conclusion of the subject. The numbering of vernes has also been changed after each subjeot, which has been introduood with a heading given in the beginning of cach part. There are 5 veraes in the first part, 8 in tho second, 6 in the third, a in the fourth, 11 in the fifth, wod 3 in the sixth. Your headings have been given, for the sccond, third, foarth and fifth parts, dix. Rajavalt-varnane tn 1, 7, Vatea-barnanan in 1. 11, Matri-uurinsa in 1. 19, and Svasıra-visuh in l. 21. With respect to tho last, .e. Suafura vainsa, attention may bo drawn to the fact that although the subject of the gencalogy of the father-in-law has beon elosod in throu vorbes only, neither has a tow beadiag been given, nor has a now numbering been introduood for the following versos. 
The first part consists of 5 porscs, &s noted above, of which the first three are in praise of Gananati (v. 1), the goddess Sarasvati (v. 2) and Varuņa, the god of wator (v. 3). Then in vorse We are introdaood to tho subject of the inscription and informed that in the country known as Haritāne or modern Hariyáñã there is a town named Philli or Delhi, which is extollci in verno 5. 
The second part, in which is given the genealogy of the Malanmadan Enerperors of Dolbi, extonds from Verse 6 to 13. The town of Dhilli which was first tuled by the Tornardo and then by the Chãhamana kings, is now ruled by the Saka kings who are porno god of Nephants, horsds and men, 1.6. foot soldiers (v. 6). The following genealogy of 9 Etaperort in given in the following two verses. There was & great king named (1) Sahavvadida (Shahab-ud-din Ghori?), who was succeeded by (2) Kutvudira (Qutb-ud-din Aibuk). (3) Samasaddina (Shams-ud-din Altanish), (4) Poroja-odki (Rukn-ud-din Miroz Shih 1), (5) Alávading (Alk-ud-din Mas'aid), (6). Maujadina (Mu'izz-nd-cha Bahram Shah), (7) Nagaraddina (Nasir-ud-din Mahmud) (v.7), (8) Gayasadiña (Ghicas-ud-din Balban), and (9) Kuddi Llavadina (Ald-ud-din Khilj) who was then ruling over Delbi (v. 8). 
1 This god has also bodu invoked in the Bhädlitid inscription of the Paremkra Parnuptia of V. 8. 1102, on which I have written a paper in the Bo. At. Soe. Joux., Vol XXIII, yp, 75 ft.

LADNU INSCRIPTION OF SADHARANA.

The word Kuddi I cannot identify, but Ala-ud-din of the Khilji dynasty is, apparently, meant. Vorse 9 beatow& puroly conventional praiso on Alä-ud-din. He is further desoribed as baving first conquered the southern part of India (v. 10) and then conquered the kings of Vaiga, Tilanga, Gürjjara, Karpāța, Gaudadian, the hill chiefs of Garjjana and the Pandyas on the shoros of the ocean and to have re-installod thom in their position, whion fact is cumpared to his erecting permanent monuments of his victory over those countries (v. 11). Thu following yergo it again in eulogy of Ala-ud-din, in which it is stated that there is, was, and shall be no king who can bo a matoh ta him (v. 12). la verso 13 we are informod that a person pamed 8adbárana, lord of Parā, was in favourite of the kiug (Ala-ud-din) and, on acoount of his merits, became his treasurer. 
The third part begins from vorne 14 and supplies as with the three names of the ancestors of Sádbaraua. In the town of Vi in the wont there lived a Kshatriya namod Bhuvana pala who was born in the Kibyapa gitra (v. l.6). I am unable to identify this village of Ui.! He was married to Susila who gave birth to a son named Nalhada (v. 15). Nallada han Jönbi for his wife, who bore to him a son named Kirtipala (v. 16). Kirtipala was married to Nalhada, from whom was born Badhărana (v. 17). Tho following two verses are purely onlogistio of Sadhåraņa (vs. 18-19). 
The fourth part consisting of only two verses describes the gonealogy of the mother of Sadhirapa, Thero was a Kshatriya named Sahāraṇa who had Jaunapala as his son, from whom sprang Juma (v. 20). Jilma was married to Jõi of tho Srimad götris, who bore him it daughter namod Nalbada, who gave birth to Sadhārana. I am unable to traco out the Srimad molra anywhere. This Sūdhūrain was rospected by kings and was a charitably disposeil man. He gavo a luksha-dīna (i.e. articles of the value of one lac of rupoes) (v. 21). 
The Afth part properly consists of only three verses, as already noted above, in which is de scribed the godoalogy of Sådhårawa's father-iu-law; but as the numbering of the verses still ruos ow, wo have taken this part as comprising olovun versos, of which the list alghe record the ovent of Sadharana's oausing a step-well to be sunk in the village of Ladnū. There was a Kshatriya mashed Haripāla who lived in Divapanapura (v. 22). I have not been successful in identify ing the town of Divaṇanapura for want of the uanno of the District wheroin it was situated, To him was born a son pamed Sadada (v. 23). Sådada had a daughter named Nägi whom ho wave in marriage to Sådhårana (v. 26). Sadhāraph, who was thus descended from two pare families, chorishod a wish, in conjunction with his wife, to have a reservoir of water dug out as 
matter of charity (v. 25). At a distance of 7 yojanas (i..., 30 kos or 60 miles) to the cast of Nagapattana, ie, the present Nāgor, the capital of the country callod Sapädalakaha, modleru Savālakha, there is a waterless (desert) tract of land called Ladņū (v. 26), whore cverything but water was. eusily procurable; and, thereforc, Sadhūrasa coased a stop-well to bo dug out as a work of charity (v. 27). The next verse is in praise of the step-well stating that it may quench the thirst, wash tho sins off and thus cause happiness to people in goncral, and that it has been dag from solf-earned money. The well is again extolled in verse 29, wbich hava that the villagers, who drink its clear water, call it a very charitable work, while tho pagsers-by, who quonch their thirst, praise its constructor as they walk away, saying that it was fortunato that he was born on this earth. It is further added that this step-well appears as if it had been constractol by Visvakarman (the mason of the gods) aud suppliod with ambrosia by the gods, as ite water looks like a sheet of silver and, therefore, tho wise louk opon it as their own (v. 30). Sadhārana has been successful in ploasing the gods, the pitris or manes, and the peoplo of this

31). The persou who causes a stop-woll, a well, a tank, a templo, eto, to be built, enjoys happiness for a long time on this earth as well as in tho hoaven like Indra (v. 32). Then follows & benedictory · verso in the name of Sádhārana (v. 33). In the next verse is given the name of the porson who composed the prasasti, viz. dikshita Kimachandra; the date of its composition is given as Thiirsday, the Jaya tithi of the month Vaisakha in V. 8. 1972 (v. 34), Hore the year is givon in two figures as 72, bat & roforence to line 30 infra, woald show that it is 1372. The dato is not given clearly in the original text, but only the day, month and year are given. Jaya is the name given in astrology to throe datos, viz., the 3rd, 8th and 13th ; but which of these is meant here, it is difficult to determine. It might, perhaps, be the 3rd of the bright half of Vaisakha, AB tho word pradhana would load us to suppose ; for this date, usually called Akshaya-tritiya, is observed as a festival and considered auspicions even up to this day in the whole of Märwār. Versc 35 expressos a wish that the stop-well may last, (as also the name of Sådhårana,) as long as the sup, the moon, the oceans and the earth exist. The date of the inscription is given in prose in lino 30, which is Friday, the 3rd of the dark fortnight of Bhadrapada of v. s. 1978, or Friday, the 6th August A.D. 1316,1 when Sådhårapa caused the pratishthā or the consecra tion ceremonies to be performed of the step-woll, which is situated to the south of the village of Lāda û. It is also stated that this was done in the reign of Suratäna Kuţvudi (Qutb-ud-din Maburak Shah), aon (succossor) of Alăvadina (Ala-ud-din Khilji), and that aftor him (Mubarak Shab) Gayāgadina (Ghiyaa-ud-din Tughlaq) asounded tho throne of Delhi (v. 36). Only this much of this verso is clear and no sonse can be made out from the rest. The last verse (i.e, 37) is again in eulogy of Sādhārapa, Tho two lines on each sido supply us with the information that the second part of the prasasti after verse 35 was written by & Gauda Kayastha named Dandā, son of Dalâ and grandson of Mahiya: that this step-woll.was dug under the supervision of red &Ti-Nainasiha; and tbat the prasusti was ongraped by a nason (sutradhora) named Balakbaņa. 
We thus so that the first part of the prasasti was written by dikshita Kimachandra in the month of tho Vaisakha of the Vikrama year 1372, when Ald-ud-din Khilji was tho Emperor 
Dolhi, us is clear from the use of the prosent tense in Alīvadinab kshitipöæsti sadyah (v. 8), prabhureqsti sadyah (v. 9), and samjato na pura na chati bhavitā (v. 12). But when the step-woll was oponed to the public after performing the pratishtha (consecration ritos), the ruling princo was Qutb-ud-din Khilji, which fact is evident from the following words Alava dina-putra-Suratāna:Kutuudina-vijaya-kalyana-rajyè (1. 31); while the words Gayāsadinas-tu miri*pasztalo-bhū[(*](1.32) lead us to infer that when the last portion of the prasasti was com mitted to tho stono, Ghiyas-ud-din had succeeded Qutb-ud-din Khilji as Emperor of Delhi. Although it has not been clearly stated in the body of the inscription that it was incised during the reign of Ghiyás-ud-din, yet as he raled for four years from V.S. 1378-1382 (or A.D. 1321-1325) and a roference to his name as a prince has bcon made (1. 32), we may safely say that the lator portion of the prasasti WBN engraved during his reign. In short, this whole prasasti was not composed and engraved at one and the same time and in one and the game reign, but it was inscribed at different timos and in different reigas. The first portion of tho prasasti up to verse 35 was composed by dikshita Kamachandra in the reign of Alä-ud-din Khilji in V.S. 1372 and was incised on stone in the reign of Qatb-ud-din Mabarak Shāh in V.S. 1373. During this interval the rule of Shahāb-ud-din Umar was over, and hence no rofercnoo is made to his name. Tho later portion, from line 30 to 33, and two lines on the 
wy. 
| Profexror Kielhorn gives two datos as its equivalent (vide No. 266 of his List of Northorn Inscriptions); the other being " Friday, 26th August A.D. 1817," 
1 There is, howover, a mention of Sri Nairyanooya and Samasadina in line 32, and we may identity Naivyanovya with the malera Nārnaul, of which Samasadina was, perhaps, a viceroy.

margin were composed by the Ganda Kayastha Danda and engraved in the reign of Ghiyas-ud din Tughlaq, 2.e. between V.S. 1378--1382. No mention has been made of Khusbrú Nāsir ad-d in probably on acconnt of big brief tonure of power. 
The inscription unfolds, under the heading of rajavali-varnunai, the dynasty of 10 Muham" madan Emporors of Delhi from Shabab-ud-din Ghöri to Ald-ud-din Khilji; but tho list differs a great deal from that given in the Persian history called Tawirikh-t-Hirishta, acrord ing to which some namos soom to have been omitted and some rovereed in thoir order. Bolow is giveu a statomont comparing the gendalogy contained in this inscription with that of Firishta, as also their datos in Hijri, Christian and Vikrama erns :

It may be noted that the prasasti writor has, porhaps for want of knowledgo of history, omitted 3 namos, viz., Årám Shah (No. 3 in the above list), Razīyā Bögam (No. 6) and Mu'izz-ud-din Kai Qubåd (No. 11). Similarly, in the genoalogy subsequently added after vorbe 35, which is shown in the above statement holow the dotted line, the names of Shahāb-nd. din Umar (No. 14) and Näsir-ud-din (No. 16) havo been loft oat, porhaps on accoant of their very brief tonure of power. Besides, in the genealogy as given by the prasasti writer the anmes of 7 and 8 have been roversed, so that the dame of the son (Alā-ud-din Mas'ad) has been put in the place of the father (Mu'izz-ud-din Bahram Shah), and vice versa. This is probably either dyo to his lack of knowledge of the history of the Muhammadan Emporors or because tho pame of Alå-ad-din, who was the son of Firoz Shah, has been put in after that of his father

(i... Firoz), and tbon Mu'izz-ud-dip and Näsir-ud-dia (sons of Shams-ud-din No. 4) bayo boon mentioned; bnt the correct list is that given by Firiahtå. Again, & roference to Nos, 12 and 1:3 will show that Shahāb-ud-din (No. '12) bas beou put in beforo Ald-ud-din. (No. 13) in the prasasti, simply because the former was the father of tho latter; but bis name has beon expungod by tho Firightå, because he never ruled, and in his place Jalūl-ud-din has been montioned, who actually ruled. Shahāb-ud-din's name is merely mentioned by the Finishti as the father of Alū-ud-dīn but not an Emperor.1 
After this mcption of the dynasty of the Muhammadan Emperors who ralod over Dellii, the inscription supplies us with four names of tho genealogy of Sadhărana, who caused tho step-well to be construotod. It is stated that in a village named Ui thore lived & Kaha triya of the Kāśyapa götra named Bhuyanapāla. Similarly, in the genoalogy of his mother there is also the montion of Sāhirana being a Kshatriya of tho Srimad götra. And, again, his father-in-law's ancestor is also styled as a Kshatriya. So we sou that tho sumo word Kshatriya has been used in all the three genealogies, which leads us to believe that Såd harapa was a Khaltri by caste and not a Kájput; becauso, firstly, Brūbmapic gotras are, as a rule, not speci fied of Rūjpūt families ; &ccondly, if he had been really . Räjpūt, his sopt such as Chähamana, Paramira, and so forth, woold ccrtainly bave boon mentioned ; thirdly, Sūdbirana was tho treasurer of tho Emperor Al-ud-dia (vide vorse 13 supra), which office is never held by the Räjpūts; fourthly, during the roign of the Muhammadan Emperors the community of Khat tris had attained both name and fame, which is a very well-known fact. Tho Khattris had then taken to service in the military as well as the civil line. Iu verso 13 there occurs a word Prerá-pati which means either (1) " lord of a village damed 'Pura '," or (2) “lord in former times "; but as there is no word to fill up the ellipsis to show of which place he was the lord in former times, it would appear that “ lord of (a village called) Puri" is the meaning intended by thu prasasti-kiira. This view is further strongthened by the fact that there is a villayo zamed Khanpurâ, 3 miles from Lüdņu, the second componont of which was, perhaps, at first used to deuoto the village, the prefix Khún being added in later times when it was granted to a Mubammadun Klin. The words mahi-tha sri-Sadharana. in the marginal line of Wie left side of tho stone, also further support this fact, as Sadhüraña is called a nuhā hino, which apparently stands for mahu-thakkura, as tho lord of a villago is called a Thäkur or at Jagirdār. Moreover, the Khattris still now usc thu word Tläkar when writing letters to their simdhis, or fathers of their children-in-law.

No. 6.-TWO INSORIPTIONS FROM BODH-GAYA. 
BY VINODA VIHARI VIDYAVINODA. . 
the earliest of theso inscriptions was discovorod by Mr. J. D. Beglar during the Restoration of the grant temple at Bodb-Gaya. The discovery was announced by the lato Pandit Bhaqwa2 Lal Indraji in 1885.24 Pandit Bhagwan Lal's version of the toxt is not very Bonrate, and I have been trying for some time to re-edit it. A facsimile was published by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1892.27 The stone itself conld not be traced either in the Indian Mugeam or at Bodila-Gaya. Aftor the death of Mr. J. D. Beglar his library and collection of stiamities wero parobased by the Archwological Survey of India. This collection of Antiquitica

were presented to the Indian Masoum in 1909, and among them was found the record (A) of Abokachalladěva, of the Lakshmanasõna yoar 51.1 
The second inscription was discovered seventy-throo years ago and was published by Pfinsep with a drawing by Mr. V. Hathorne. It was subsoquently lost sight of and Dr. Rajendra Lala Mitra could not find it at Bodh-Gaya," while Pandit Bhagwan Lal bad to edit it from Prinsop's drawing.4 Baba Rakhaldas Banerji, however, found the inscription stone bailt into one of the walls of a modern building at Bodh Gaya, in January 1906. I am indebtod to him for an inked impression of this inscription. 
Both inscriptions are dated. They are very quaintly worded, and Babu Rakhaldas has already drawn attention to tbem in his article on “Lakshmana-soda and the Muonulman Conqaost." The language of the first inscription is the incorrect Sapskrit which is common in Buddhist Sanskrit manuscripts from Nepal and has beon also found in tho Haara Kol insoription edited by Mr. Venis. The characters of the inscriptions belong to tho Eastern varioty of the North Indian alphabet of the twolfth century A.D. 
Inscription (A) has been incised on a rectangular slab of granite mesenring 19" by 10*, and consists of thirteen linea. It records the erootion of a Buddhist shrine (vihari), with an imago of the Buddha, by Bhatta Dimodars, etc., with the assent of king Asökaoballadēvad at the request of a number of his officiale. Provision was also made for offeringe (naivedya) in three chaityas with lumps by certain officials, to be offered to tho god daily by members of the Singhalese order at Mahābodhi and others. Tho date is the 29th day of Bhadra of the year 81 sinco the commoncement of the) reign (now) past, of the illustrious Lakshmanagēna. 
In oditing the text of this inscription Pandit Bhagwan Lal? supposed that the kakapadu marks in lino 9 made on oithor side of the lettor were insertod by tho royal preceptor (rījaguru) who is stated to have been an inhabitant of Kāsuira (1. 5), and ho, nytnrally, thereforo, took the letters on the top of the inscription to be Sarada. It may be noticed that whenever a kakapadıl-mark is insortod in 4 line and the corrected or inserted portion written in the margin, the number of the line is always givon with the words correctod or inserted, whethor it be in an inscription or in a manuscript. In this very inscription tho word samasta, which bas hoon omitted in the third line, has beon writton on the top with the namoral 3 aftor it to denoto the line with which it is connected, Similarly, with regard to the omissions in the ninth lipo it may be expected that a numerical symbol for 9 was naed after each of tbe letters mcant to ho insortod in that lino. Again, the similarity between the pamoral 9 of 29 in the last line of tho inscription and the index numerals on the top of the inscription, which latter Dr. Bhagwan Lal mistook for the hooked form of a dental sa, is very striking. The mistake must have been due to the supposition, as already stated, that a learned Pandit from Kāśmir entered the omissions in the script of his mothorland. If, however, the symbols which Bhagwan Lal road as tho hooked sa of the North-Western Indian alphabets be corrvctly taken to be tho Bengali numeral 9, the text affords & far easier way of restoring the inscription. It remains only to note that the Sanskrit vorse at tbe beginning of the record is the usual formula of the Buddhist creed and that Singhala-sangh-ádayas in 1l. 9-10 perhaps indicates the income which the Mahābodhi derived from tho Singhalese pilgrims of whom evidently there was a large number 
Another missing inscription found in this colloction is the Govindpur Stone Inscription of the Baka yoar 1069 (Ep. Ind., Vol. II, p. 333).

No. 7. VADNER PLATES OF BUDDHARAJA. 
[KALACOURI)-SAMVAT 360. 
By Y. R. GUPTE, B.A., Nasik. 
These copporplates, two in armber, belong to or at any rate are in the possansion of Nănă valad Ahilaji Tidkö of Vadnor in the Chándvad (Chándor) Tálakā of the Nasik District. About A year and a half ago, a Baniâ told me that he had been shown two plates by an inhabitant of Vadonor, the writing of whioh could not be deciphered. I had to make several attempts to obtain. them for examination. But I suoceeded at last in tracing the owner or pomaostor Abd getting them on loan for the purpose of taking improssions and deciphering the inscription. On raading them I found that they contain a grant issued by Buddharaja of the Kalachani dynasty Brihranna

VADNER PLATES OF BUDDHARAJA

WENEM 
Bodhasvāmin of Vatanagara. One funny thing about this grant is that Nänä believes it to be a sanad of Păţilkı. He is very particular and hardly allows anybody to have a look at it. The plates are substantial. The first of them measures from 10.to 10%" long by 8" broad including tho rims. Excluding them, the longth is 10% to 101" and the breadth from 7% to 714". The sooond 
long by from 8 to 8P8" broad inoluding tho rims. Exoluding them tho length is from 101" to 101" and the breadth from 770" to 71". Tho plates havo two bales from " to " in diameter for the insertion of the two original rings, whioh havo boon lost. Whether there was any soal or not I cannot oonfidently say. There aro however no traces of one, jpst As is the case with tho Sarsa vņi plates. When the grant camo under my notice, the Vadnor platos word hold together by two thin rings rooently made. The oigos of the plates have been raised into rims, so as to proteot the inscription. Either of them boars writing on tho inner side only. The second plate is a littlo brokou at the right rim where line 28 ende. The weight of the plates is 129 tolas, without tho rings. The letters aro very deeply and well cut. Thoy do not show through on the reverse sides at all. Some are, howovor, damagod and some have been completely destroyod by verdigris. I have restored the damaged and lost letters and words by means of the Abbona and tho Sarsayņi plates, montioned bolow. 
The alphabet very closely resemblos that of tho Sarsuvni plates of Buddharája 1 (the only poouliarity worth noticing about the Vadnor grant boing that the a-strokes aro not brought so far down as in the Saraavpi platos), and closely to that of tho A bhopa or rather Abhõņā platos) and the Valabhi insoriptions. The characters aro, theroforo, of the regular typo of tho poriod and locality to whioh tho record rolatos. The numerical symbols for 300, 60 10 and 3 occur in the dato portion in line 34. The language is Sanskrit. five of tho ungal benodictive and imprecatory verses are quoted from line 27 to line 32 Tho romaioder of the inscription is in prose. As regarda orthography wo may note the doubling of & consonant before y in -ddhyla-, 1. 14; middhyandina, 1, 21. In a similar way the consonants following rare usually doublod; thog arkkarnnava-, 1. 20; -sarggēn=,1. 23 ; svarggé, 1.27 ; dirygha-, l. 24 ; -drijana, l. 8 ; -Orijita., 1. 10; narendrair=ddanini, I, 31 ; -darppa-, l. 16; -Otsarppanırıthan, l. 22 ; wirbuhuklaa, 1. 31; panchabhir-mmalui., 1.26; dharmma., 11. 9, 11, 12; dharmmirliha-, 1, 31 ; ganbhirnyatati, 1. %; -siddhireyyêna, 1.6; -dhairyyasauryyasthairyy-, 1. 15; durllanghi, 1. 2; pūrovu., 1. 30; saruv-, II. 17, 19, 20; bahubhir=vvusuchi, 1. 29. On the other band we find kirtyi, 1, 3, and, of course, varsha-, l. 27. The class nasal and not the Anunvdru is commonly used in tho interior of a word, the only real excoption being -bhangaya, 1.8. A final sibilant before a sibilant ins commonly assimilatod; thns=upētas sampanna., 1. 5; ilhammas=sréyo-, l. 9; eto, but - Mīlēšva rah fris, ll. 14, 17. The Jihvimültya is used in parah-kulurka“, - ralitat-kula., 1, 4; tho 
· Upadhmäntyu in -tigrahan-parabhi-, 1.8; -frih-pra., 1. 10; -prarlah= pūrvv", 1. 13; dhyatuh parama-, 1. 14 ; -karah-pra., l. 17; -mantavy nh=pälayitavyasx, 1. 25. The use of sh instead in -kalinash=putra, l. 21, is simply a midwriting. Before sth a final : has been dropped in novordance with the Värttika on Pån. VIII, iii , 36 in usētu sthitinīna, 1, 16. Instead of t1 we find tv in - satv., 1. 2; is used for # in -chanchalan, 1. 24; * for ih in pradiivansa, l. 16; ri for ti in prakriti-, 1, 5; kripana-, l. 13, soporfluous si has been added in mahimaitain, 1. 30. The rules of Sandhi have sometimes boon neglected ; compare pratishtha payita aty, 1. 12; vriddhaya udah, l. 23. Most instances ocour at the end of a line ; thus yathsīvat, 1. 5, before atmany 1.0 ; -tänain, 1. 12, before un-, 1. 18; -syöt, l, 26, before ity=, 1. 27; cha, l. 27, before anus, l. 28; likhitan, 1 $, betoru idam, 1. 84. 
The inscription is one of Buddhardja, the son of Sankaragana, the son of Krishnarāja of the family of the Katachohurit. In the Aihole inscription the same form Katachchuri occurs.3

That tho forms Kalatsori, Kalaohari, Kalachuri, Katuohchuri and Kalnchohuri are identical and are applicd to the same fainily has been shown by Dr. Fleet. This Buddhardja of the Vadnor plates, I neel hardly say, is the Buddharăja mentioned in the Sarrapņi platos in the Nerür plates, and in tho Mahakota or Makutosvara columo inscription. Tho Vadnêr grant is of importanco inasmuch as it is the oarliest known grant of Buddhariji Katachcbari, the Sargavpi plntos being igsucd in 361 of the Kalachuri era. Only two grants, excluding the present one, issued hy the old Kalachuris who ruled over the Nāsik and other distriots and, roughly, over Central Indin, and who appear to be the imporial dynastys, were up till now known to us. It may, how evur, bo romarkod that those Anoient Kalachuris aro also referrod to in the Aiholo infcription", the Nerür plates 5, and the Siókhoda plate of Santilla. The geographical names gironi throw some light on the question about the area over which tbe dynasty oxorcisod powor, I may horo note that the power of the Kalachuris was not crushed though Buddharija Wux dufcated by Mangališa. lIis Sarsavpi and Vadněr plates prove this, being both posterior to the Makatösvara inscription. 
The Vadnir grant was issued whilo Buddharăja's victorious camp was pitched at Vidiga. The purpose for which it was made, is tho usual one, 297., to provide for the fivo groat sacrifices bali, charu, raišrailēra, aganihötra and for others. Tho name of the donse is Bodbasvamin, of the Vájasan iyu-Madhyandinn school, who was a resident of Vatanagam and belonged to the Kaśyapa yötra. 
The objoct of the grant is described in exactly the same way as in tho Saraavnt plates. Tho village granted in the latter is first defined with regard to the district and bhöga to which it belongs, and then described as beiog situated near another locality, apparontly one that was butter koown. After this follows the name of the villago. Similarly in our grant, we aro first told that the village belooged to the Vatanagara bhogar and was situated near Bhattaürikā. Thon follow, in tho pinco whero the name of the village is given in the Samsuvni plates, the words Kūnivinas Ieshu yrinis.* Tho village has accordingly been dusiynated, not by a propor name, but as a villago of kiniyals. Who those köniyus Wero, I cannot say with confidenco. I feel however iuclined to agree with Mr. Bhandarkar, who thiuks that they may be tho Kolis of the present day. 
Of these localities Vatanagara is douhtleya Viunormwinually called Bahirolachi Vadner to distinguish it from other villages of the samo namo-io the Chiudvad Tülnkā of the Násik Dis trict, whøre the plates were discovered. It wax the head quarters of the Wilöga of the same nume. Thu Marātlií form of Sanskřit vata is vad and nngurit would regularly becomo mër, just as in l'impalnér, from Pippalanagara, and Champaner from Olampūnagara. Bhattaúrika may possibly by Bhatgaon abont nine miles from Vadner. Bhatta becomes that accord jug to a woll-kuown rulo: a double consonant in Präkrit is replacod by a singlo consonant, and the preceding vowel, if short, is longthened. Cf. Marathi bhāt, Průkrit Thatta rico ; Marathi act, Prakrit satta, seven. As an instance of the omission of the second part of the name of a village or town, wo may compare Kondoruminya in the Mahüköte column inscription, the very record of Buddharaja's defeat, which is evidently the modern Kondür. Again we know that tho modern Jedda may be connected with the Jedugür of the Balagúmve inscription of Vinayaditya. We can quote many instancos whore pur or gaon is addod to the name of a town or a village, to which we find uo equivalont expression in the inscriptions. Vidise is probably tha

famous capital of the Daśårņas on the Votravatıl, the modern Bdsnagar, near Bhilai. Similarly the Abhona plates of Sarkaragana were issued from Ujjayinl. I have thought of the possibility of identilying the lattor with the modern Ujjayini, or Ujjani in the Sinnar Tülaka of the Násik District, and sometime I was inclined to think that Vidisa might be the prosont Tisgaon in the Chándor Täluka, 3} miles from Bhagaon. It seems however hardly possible to derive Tisgaon from Vidite, and I think it safer provisionally to adhore to the identifications montioned above. The more so if Mr. Bhandarkar is right in assuming that the Katachchuris roigned at Mahishmati. 
The present record is dated in words and namerical symbols on the 19th day of the bright half of Bhadrapada of the (Kalachuri) year 880. The dato doos pot adınit of complete veri fication. Diván Bahadur Pillai has been good enough to caloulate it for me, and he has in. formed me that it might correspond to either Friday, 11th August A.D. 607, or Thursday, 29th August A.D. 608, or Tuesday, 19th August A.D. 609. I am inclined to think the last of these dates the right one. 
As regards the epithots of Sankaragana, Professor Kielhorn's romark that tho author W&o acquaintod with and borrowod or imitated oortuin opithots which are found only in somo of the Gupta inscriptions,' is up to the point, and this was just what occurred to me whon I first read them. I would hero add that the coins found at DAv!And in the Bāglān Taluka of tho Násik Distriot, but occasionally met with throughout the district and wrongly attribatod to the end of tho 4th century A.D. by Dr. Bhau Dājis and others were (as is shown by Profoskor Rapson), imitated from the later Gupta coins. As I intend to publish a short note on theso coins, it is better that I shonld not dwell on them here. , Suffice it to say that the Gupta influence can bo traced in the official documents of the Katachchuris and in the coinage of the Násik District of about the 6th and 7th centuries A. D. 
The accompanying plate has been prepared from estampagos made by mc in Vadnor. The owner would not consent to the plates being sent to Ootacamund for the purposo. On the wholo however, the estampages aro plain enough in all important placos, and the passagos which can. not bo read with cortainty can be supplied from tho Sarsavni platos.

In the family of the Katachchuris--which, like the wide ocean, is stainless and extensive Be the sky clear on the beginning of autumn; shining by the mass of the rays of various jowols of men (as the ocean ia illaminod by tho rays of its procious stones); difficult to be transgressod sinoe it is the abode of great courage (as the ocean is the abode of big creatures) ; grave and bent on obgerving settled rules (as the ocean is deep and is anxious to remain within its bounda ries)-(there lived) the illustrious Krishnaraja, who enlightened the world with his fadio pleasing to all men as the moon illamines with light; who from his birth was sololy dovoted to Pabupati (Biva) just as the moon supports itself on Siva; who though having no blemish furthers the prosperity of his family as the moon (who bas a spot) revives the beauty of a beil 
pight lotuses ; who was approached by all virtues which attract mon to a king and by other qualities as if through a desire to get a choice resting place; who was poBacsBed of all the natural endowments of royalty; who duly got tbe good rosults of the royal powers; who, brilliant with his glorious family, the flow of his munifoonce being aninterrupted and the gravity of his strength being ronowned, rashing boldly effected the conquest of the regions just as the head of wild elephants, congpiouons by its magnificent backbone, with tho ceaseless stream of its johor, showing the excellonco of its strength, roaming here and there at its will, breaks down a row of forest trees; whose weapon was (used) for the proteotion of the distressod; who foaght to humble the pride of his foes whose learning was for modesty; who obtained riches (oply) to give; who made donations only for the soke of religious merit; whose religions merit was acquired in order to obtain final beatitude. 
(L. 9.) His son was the illustrious Sankaraganan, an ardent devoteo of Mabośvara (Siva) ; the sovereign of the regions bounded by the eastern and western oceans and of other countries ; who meditatod on the foot of his parents; who was matchloss in this world; whoso glory was rolisbred by the waters of the four ooeans; whose grandeur was like that of Dhapada, Varnna, Indra And Antika; who gained the prosperity of a king by the prowess of his own arms; before whom the circle of all tributary princes bent down owing to the oxcollence of his valour; who

onjoyod roligious merit, wealth and ploasure without allowing them to overpower one another ; whose profound and high mind was gratified only by submission ; who acted piously by making donations of the ample riches got by protecting his subjoots woll; who reinstated royal families that had been deposod for a long time; who annihilated those that were very proud ; who gave to the poor, the blind and the helpless the objects of their desire more fully Had they yearned after. 
(L. 14.) His son, who meditates on his feot, the only ornament of the whole earth ; who is possessed of all the most famous qualities,' good conduct, modosty, meroy, liberality, ability, courtosy, fortitude, heroism, steadiness and others; who causes the dostruction of the greatness of vanity produced from power of mighty chemies; who is a dam of all settled rulos and a home of saccess; who with his unobstructed army roliovos the sufferings of his subjects like the wielder of the discus (Vishạn) with his diso incapable of being opposed; the zealous devotee of Mabośvara, the glorious Buddharāja givos this order to all kings, tributary princos, Bhogikas, rulors of vishayas, hoads of provinces and villages, and big officers and others. 
(L. 18.) Let it be known to you. To promote the religious merit of op wo have given with libations of water, tho village of the Koniyas, in the Vatanagara-bhoga, which is noar Bhattaürikā, together with the udranga, the uparikara, and all receipts, free from all ditya, forced labour and pratibhēdikā, according to tho maxim of bhūmichchhidra, not to be entered by swindlers and servants who are liars,1 to bo enjoyed by Bons, sons' sons and further descendants (1.0., the enjoyment of which is to be hereditary), as long as the moon, the sun, the Rod and the carth exist, to the Brähmapa Bodhasvámin, who rosides at Vatanegara, belongs to the Kasyapa gotra, and to the Vījaaaněya-Mädbyandina school, for the maintenance of bali, charu va:svadēva, agnihotra aud other rites. For which roason future kings and governora, whether of our own lineage or others, considering that this worldly existence is as unsteady as the waves of water impellod by violent wind, that wealth is perishable and worthless (devoid of substance) and tbat virtues last long, desiroas of obtaining, in common with us, the morit of this grant of land and anxious to acquire for a long time fame as bright as tho raya of the moon, should agree to and protect our gift. Whoovor with his intellect covored by tho coating of the darkness of ignorance, should rovoke it or allow it to be revoked, shall incur the guilt of having committed the five great sids. It has been declared by tho holy Vyāga, the arranger of the Vodas: "Ho who gives land rojoicos in heavon for sixty thousand years; ho who rescinds (grants of) land or consents to their being rescinded, will dwell in hell for the samo number of years." “l'hose who resume grants of land, aro born is black serponts, living in dry hollows (of trees) in the water less forests of Vindhya." “ Land has been enjoyed by many kings from Sagara downwards; he who for the time being in tho lord of the land, has the fruit of it." "O Yudhishtbira, carefully preserve the land given to Brāhmaṇas by former kings, O bost of kings; preservation is better than giving."

No. 8.-- BELAVA COPPER-PLATE OF BHOJAVARMADEVA. THE FIFTH YEAR. 
BY RADHAGOVINDA BABAK, M.A.; RAJSAHT. 
This plato was parohased by Mr. Pramathapatha Datta, B.A., Assistant Sottlement Officer, in the month of June, 1912, at a villago, pamod Bolīva, situated on the northern boundary of Rapganj Thana, in the Mahoávardi Pargand of the Nirāinganj Sub-Division of the Dacca district in the Presidenoy of Bengal, where it was discovorod by an illiterato Muham. 
digging a plot of hard roddish land in the prociucts of his cottage. A prominent mark, about half-an-inch deep, was accidently cut into the top-odgo on the right-hand side of the plate by the spade of the villager as bo was digging. An imperfect reading of this plate with a faulty translation was published at Dacca ' but without any fac-si mile. I odit the inscription from a photo which I took when the plate was kindly placod in my hands for two days only by Mr. Datta for decipherment. I could not get a further opportunity of comparing the photo with tho original plate. 
The plate measoros about 9}" broad by 101" high, It had a deal with the roprosentation of Vishnu's wherl (cf. śrīmad-Vishnu-chakra-mullrayā, 1. 48), at the top; but the impress of the sacred wheel was complotely soraped off by the finder of the plate, who thought the plato was made of gold. So, it is difficult now to say if the name of the king was incined therein. The plate is inscribodi on both sidos, the obverse side containing 26 lines of writing, and the reverso sido 25 lines. The engraver's Dame is not mentioned. The writing is generally in an excollent state of preservation except in lines 12-14, and 17-21, where tho plato has suffered from corrosion, which has roodorod a few lottors indistinct and illegible. 'T'lio sizo of the letters throughout is about f" with the exception of those occurring in the first two lines on tho reverso side, where they aro a littlo largor than the rest. The inscription is written in the northern characters of the 11th contury A.D. The anusvára has been denoted in two ways, viz. by a point above the horizontal top-lino, as in Edpatyun, l. 1, and by the ordinary Bengali anuvara sign of modern times as in nāyanai, 1. 1. Tho sign of visarga has been omitted twice, in the words siddhi (1. 1), and frīmail-Bhöja (1. 26). Some letters also have boen omittod, very likely through oversight on the part of the soribe or the engraver, in linoa 18, 22, 23, 28, 37, 39 and 43. The sign of avagraha has not been used at all. Orthography also is not faultless thronghont. The only point of orthography that calls for any remark is that although the lotters, ta, ya, na, ma, and ga have been doubled after r, the lottor va in this position remains single, excopt in the words - Auruva- and Yajuruvēda- (1. 42). Tho language of the inscription is Sanskrit. 
The inscription opens with oi siddhi[*) and has 15 verses on the obverse side, in the first five of which tho oulogist Purushottama (cf. v. 15) doscribes the mythological ancestors of the Yadu family from which the Varmans traced their origin. From the first three verses we got tbo mythological genealogy of these ancestors of the Yadu family in tbe following order :-(1) Svayambut (Brahmā), (2) Atri, (3) Chandra, (4) Budha, (5) Purtravas, (6) Ayu, (7) Nahusha, (8) Yayati and (9) Yadu. In verso 4, Krishna, the chief actor of the Mabåbharata,' is said to have descended from the family of Yadu. Verso 3 informs us that the Varmans were the 'kinsmen of Hari' (Krishna) and were well-versed in tho Vodas and skilled in warfaro. They are doboribed to havo occupied simhapura, probably the same place As Sihapura, which is mentioned in the Mahavansa, vi, 35 ff., as situated in Laļarattha, 6.8. Radha. Verso 6 gives us the name of the first Varman as Vajravarman, who is described to

have boen valiant, yet mild, and who was a great poet and a learned man. In verses 7-8 we get a description of the second Varman, Jåtavarman, the son of Vajravarman, who is said to have heen famous for his mercy, heroism and oharity, and to have oxtonded his paramount pawor, by putting many horoes to shame and conquering the province of Kāpartips (Assam). It is in this eighth verse that we get some olue to the contemporaneous history of the times when Jäta varman floarisbod. I have readily adopted the valuable suggestions of my venerablo friend Mr. Akshayakumira Maitröya, B.L., Director of the Varondra Research Society, about some of the names of persons and places of historical importance that oocar in this verge. Mr. Maitröya is of opinion that Virabri, who, it the next verse, is said to have been the queen of Jätavarman and mother of king såmalavarman, was a daughter of Karna and it is for this reason that the poot has used the phrase parinayan Karnnasya Virafriyan in verso 8. Mr. Maitrėya invited my attention to verse 9, canto I., in Sandhyakara Nandin's Itäma.charital (history of king Rāmapāla of Ganda), wherefrom wo koow that this Karpa, andoubtodly the Kalachuri (Chodi) Karpa of the 11th century, whose coppor-plate grant is dated 1042 A.D., gave another daughter of hiø, named Yauvanasri, in marriage to king Vigrahapala III., with a view to please His Majesty after he (Karpa) had sustained a defeat in the field of battle. The second point of historical value which Mr. Maitröya brought to my notice is the identification of the name of Divya in the compound word divya-bhuja-friyan (V. 8) with Divya or Divvoka, the leader of the Kaivarta revolt, who killed Mahipala IT., son of Vigrahapāla II1., in battle and ocoapiod Veröndri, the janakabhū, birth-placo, of the Pila kings I (cf. Rima-carita, canto I, 29, 31-39). Kamartips (4.88am) is described as having heen conquered by this Jātavarman (paribhavannsstäni Kamarüpa-sriyan v. 8). It is very probable that Jatavarman might have availed himself of this opportuno moment of the revolt in Varóndri of the Kaivartas undor Divya, for procedding towards Kamarüpa and bringing the province under his own sway. I am unable at present to identify with absolute cortninty the name of Govardhana referred to in the third line of this verse. May he be the father of Bbatta-Bhavadovs who want the Prime Minister of king Harivarman of East Bengals? For some of these guggostions I wish to express my indebtedness also to the newly-published Bengali work, Gauda-rajamala from the ablo pen of my estoomod friend Mr. Ramapragada Chanda, B.A., Hon. Seoretary, Varēndra Resoaroh Society. Verse 9 describes sāmalavarman, son of Jåta varman and Viraári, as one' whose name was a blessing to the world. The last line of this verge seems to mention another porson, the poet's mastur (prabhu). In vorne 10, we are told that he had & son Udayin, who must have been a great warrior, whom pone could approach in the battle-field, 'who saw only his own face reflected in front, in his own sword'. In verses 11-12, his daughter Malavyadevi is described. She 
as exceedingly beautiful and was married to king Såmalavarman, 'though his barem was full of the daughters of numerous kings'. Vorsos 13-14 are in praise of king Bhöjavarman, the donor of the grant. Considering the historical time as deduced from the contents of verse 8, ono may feel inclinod to take the mention of the Rakshasas of vorst 14, to refer to the wars of king Rima (Rāmapäla) who regained the kingdom of Varöndri from the hands of the Kaivartas aftor defeating them in battle. It is. therefore, most befitting on the part of the court-poet Purushottanas (verse 15) to invoke blessings on king Bhojavarman at this junctare, and to wish that he may become the overlord of Lanka, 1.. defeat and onst the Rakshasas, the destroyers of peace. The sixteenth verse in lines 50.51 is one of the usual impreostory versos. From line 24 to 49, the inscription is in prose.

• Paramasoara, Paramabhattaraka, Maharajadhirūja, kiag Bbojavarman, who meditated upon 
the feet of the Maharajādhiraja simalavarman, to Rámadóvasarman, in chargo of the king's holy shrino (santyagara, I. 45), son of Vibyarūpadovalarman, grand-son of Jagannāthadova 
barman, great-grand-son of Pitambaradovasarman, who was an inhabitant of the village I of Siddhala in North „Radha, and who hailed from the Madhyadéka (of. Mana II, 21). 
The gotra, pravara, charana, and bikha of the donee is mentioned in lines 41-42. The ngmo of the village where the grant of the plot of land was made is Upyalika, situated in the Kausambi-ashtagachohha khandala, in the Adhahpattana mandala, in the prosperous Pauņdra bhukti. I am at present unable to identify the village. The order of the donation was insued to the various royal officors anil other dependants of the king from his camp of viotory situated at Vikramapura (evidently in East Bengal). The officers mentionod in our inscription are the same as we find in the Ballálasāna plate of Kitwa discovered last year and in other Bengal plates, with only two additional names, pithikavitta and mahdvyūhapati, the latter occurring also in the Furidpar plate of king Harivarman. 
The inscription is dated in l. 51. on the 14th day of Śråvana, in the 5th year of the reign of king Bhõjavarmadove. It ends with the usual ondorsement of the king and ono of his chief officers (in the present instance, the king's mahakshupaçulika, rocord-keeper).

TRANSLATION. (Verse 1.) In this universe, Atri, the sago of tho gode, was an offspring of Svayambhū (Brabma). From the light of his eyes the moon was born. 
(V. 2.) From him sprang Budha, the son of Rohini, and from hiru Parīravas, tho son of Ilę, who was choson by fame (kirti), by Urvasi, and by Earth. 
(V. 3.) He again, the equal of Manu, bogot Ayu; from that king was born tho protector, of the earth Nabusha; from him was born the great king Yayāti ; he aguin got the son Yadu; from him starts this line of kings, wherein the goddess of valoar (virasti*), and Hari were many times seen in person. : 
(V. 4.) In this family again appeared Krishna, who sported with hundreds of gõpis, the chief actor of the Mahabharata, the worshipful one, a partial incarnation of the Lord, who raised the burden of the Earth. i 
(V.5.) (The knowledge of) the throa Vodas is a covering for men, and those who aro devoid of it are certainly nakeds, (thinking) so the kinsmen of Hari, the Varmang, nailing thomselves with their hairs standing on and in their enthusiasm for the throa Voday and for marvellons fights, and wearing the very solemu name and possossing noblo arius, occupied Sirahapura, which may be likened to the cavo of lions.

(V. 6.) In the course of time, there was (ono) Vajravarman, the auspicious ornament of the Yādava soldiors in their victorious march of battle, who was like Death to his enemies, like the moon to his relatives, a poet amongst poets and the most learned among the erudite. 
(V.7.) Jatavarman was boro from him (Vajravarman), just as Bhishma (the son of Ganga) was born of Santanu ; perey was his (life's) vow, battlo his pastime, and charity his 
chiof delight. 
(V. 8.)

(V. 9.) The glorious Samalavarmadáva, whose name was the foremost blessing to the World, was born (in tho womb of) Virasri. What more shall I tell ?-my master (also) was endowed with all kingly virtues-dewerit found no shelter with him at all. 
(V. 10.) [le had a son Udayin, who saw only his own faco, reflectod in front in his own sword, in battle-fields which were full of many an irresistible horo. 
(V. 11.) He liad a daughter, M&lavyadēvi, the most beautiful lady in the three worlds, who was (as it vere) tho bauuer of the god of Love (lit, the mind-born one), the great wrestlor in the conquest of the world. 
(V. 12.) It was this lady who became the chief queen of Samalavarman, though his barem was full of the daughters of onwerous kings. 
(V. 13.) They had a son, Sri Bhöjavarman, who was (as it were) the light of both the fainilies (paternal and maternal),-by whom, in all oiroa mstances, affection was not taken away from deserving persons, (but their) gloon was dispellod (by him),

The stone was originally brought from Batibāgarh, a village 21 miles north-west of Damob and included in the Hatta tahsil. Batibågarl was once the seat of Musalman governors sont from Delhi and there are ruins of a fort and other remains of its past greatnces including inscriptions both in Sanskrit and in Persian. 
The one I edit is engraved on a slab l'11" x 1'6" and is in a good state of proservation. The language is Sanskrit written in Någari characters, the average size of letters being in The writing covers a space of l' 7"xl. The whole record is in verse except the word Siddhin at the commencement and subhai bhavatu at the end, togethor with the details of the dato repeatod in figures in lino 14. There are altogether 15 vorbes in the 16 lines which the inscription contains. 
The only noticeablo orthograpbical peculiarities are the indifferent use of 8 for $ 8g in litre 7 where fastra- and -śāstrit. are written sastra- and -sõstra- respectively, and the employment of 
in some places, for instance in line 8, where Khoja is written Shojā, and in line 14 where we find Vaisakha- as Vaisāšha.. This is however quite in keeping with the Bundēkhandi practice, which is even now followed by writers of the old school, who always express their kh by sh. In this inscription'kh has also been exprossed by its ordinary aymbol. as in -khandar of the first line and lilökha of the last. The letter i appears in. its antignated form in lino 8. Note also the use of the akshara va with a dot underneath in order to denote va un distinguished from ba in bhauva-, 1. 1. This is quite in accordance with the ordinary Bundēlkhapqi practice, but does not occur in other places in the inscription. 
ption records that & local Muhammadan ruler Jallale Khðja, son of fogya. caused a Gomatha to be made in tho town of Batihāạim, as also a garden and a stepwell. Jallåla, 1.0., Jalal-ud-din is stated to have been appointed as his representative by Elisämadim (Hisām-ud-din) also called Chbipaka, probably a corruption of Safiq, son of Malik Julaohi, who was made commander of the Kharpara armies and governor of the Chēdi country by Sultan Mabmüd. This Mahmnd is described as Sakëndra or lord of the Sakas, ruling from Yoginipura after having conquered other kings. The inscription further states that Jallala appointed his suryant Dhadau es manager of the institutions named above, tho principal architects whereof were Bhojñka, Kámadēva, and Hală of tho Silapattal family. The composer of the inscription was the Kāyastha Buijñka of the Mathura sab-division, and the writer another Mathara named Våsi, son of Sahadova. 
Tho dato is given in the 13th verso as Wednesday, the 3rd day of the bright fortnight of the Vaišākha month in the Vikrama year 1386. The year is oxpressed by symbolical words, and to make it clear, tbe substance of the vorse is repeated in prose immediately after- . wards, the year and the tithi being given in figures. The date regularly corresponds to Wednesday, the 13th April 1928 A.D. 
Silapatta is now known as the Silăwat casto, who are masond found in the neighbourhood of Damdh. 
9 As calcolated by Mr. Gökal Prasad Ikvaradás, Tabsildär of Diantari. He remarks that the year in this case must be taken as Asbädhädi or Karttikädi. If it istakes as Chaitridi the current Saravat would be 1886, and it would have to be supposed that the year given in the inscription was the oxpired your 1886. But as there is nothing in this inscription leading to this conclusion, the probability is that the year was Kärttikadi, taking into 
consideration the locality where the inscription was found.

. Thoro can be little doubt that Mahmûd of Yogialpura (another name of Delhi) was no other than the Turk Nabir-ud-din Mahmud of the Slave dynasty who roigned between 1246 and 1266 A.D. Mahmid subdued the Bundólkhand country, or, more correctly Chandort and Malwa in 1251 A.D., over which he appointed a governor.? This governor, whose name does not appear to bo mentioned in the Persian historica, was apparently Malik Julachi. Between the conquest of Mahmud and the record of our inscription there is an interval of 77 years, spread over 8 governors, tho Malik, his son Hisām-ud-din, and Jalal-ud-din, giving a fair normal average duration of administration for each. It is well known that those Muaalraan conqaests in this part of the country were not permanent, but in A.D. 1321 we find Tughlaq Shih dospatching his son with the troops of Chanderi, Badaun and Malwa against Telingana,* only 7 yenrs bofore our inscription was engravod. It is thereforo evident that the Musalmāns had a hold over the country at tho timo, at least thoro can be no doubt that the Damoh district was undor a Musalmün governor. This is however only of local interest. ' But what makes tho inscription very interesting, is the mention of the Kharpara armius, the Chodi country and the title of Mahmnd as Sakendra. I think that the Kharparas of our inscription are identical with the Kharparikas mentionod in Samulragupta's stone pillar inscrip. tion of Allāhåbäd. They are there mentionod amongst tho tribes conquered by this great monarch in the 4th century of the Christian era. They must havo hxou a war-liko people and must have offered not a little resistance to havo deserved notico. Mr. V. A. Smith* & dccndo ago stated that the Kharparikay may have occupiod Seoni or Mandlá distriot of the Central Provincey. How vory near tbo mark this sormige W88, in ovident from the present inscription. Sooni and Mapdlá are not very far away from Damoh, which was apparently garrisoned by the Kharpara armies in the 13th century. That Damoh was inoluded in tho Chodi country, is another inferonco which may bo drawn from this record and which goue to support in a way Justico Pargiter's localisations of tho Chudi country. Some havo hold that Chandori, if it is not a corruption of Chodi, was at least in the contre of that anciont country, and it is to Chandöri that Mahmad sont bis forces in 1251, and there he loft a governor, who in our inscription is designated as Chedidēsādhipa. Lastly tho titlu Sakēnura of this monaroh may be noted. The word suku hero a in several other instancesø, moans Musalmān. 
Tbo geographical names montioned in the insoriptions aro Yöginipura, Chēdi and Batihadim, all of which have been incidentally identified abovo Yogia para montioned in Chand Bardai's Prithviraja Riiso? as Jagginipura, is an old name of Delhi. Chodi is the well. known classical pamo of the country with the rulors of which the history of the northorn anii castern portions of the Contral Provinces was associated for many conturica. It was in this country that Batihadim, tho presont Baţibāgarh, was included. Batikūdim in the local dialoct means a heap of a collection of cow-dung cakes, and the namo seems to have changod its dim to gurl when a fort was later on built there. A step-well still exists there containing a fragmont ary Porsian inscription which informs us that it was constructed in the time of Jalal Isabäka or Jalal-ud-din, who killed Uśmån and booame Naib with the title of Akhta, in the reign of tho just end pious monarch to whom the whole of Hindustan paid respoct and by whose sword tha whole of Turkistān was subdued. This well may be idontical with the ono roferred to in our inscription, but there are two other old ones, one of which, called chaurūsi bdoli, is situated

This may be the udyana alludod to in our inscription, and it would be natural to supposo that the step-well of our insoription was made in this grovo, unless it oxisted before the grove Was planted.

No. 10.SPURIOUS ISLAMPUR PLATES OF THE GANGA KING VIJAYADITYA.. 
• THE 30TH YEAR. 
BY K. B. PATUAK AND STEN KONOW. 
The ensuing paper is the joint work of Professor Pathak and myself. The description. of the plates is due to Professor Pathak, wboso roading of the toxt bas, moreover, boen adopted in most places. The remainder has been added by mo.-S. K. ] 
The plates here edited belong to Mr. Bhiminna, alias Tatya Jinäppa Mudhalo, a resident of Islámpur, in tho Valvo taalluqa of the Satara District in the Bombay Presidency. They are however stated to have been originally brought from Mudhof in the Southern Marathi conntry, where tho owner's ancestors lived. They are five in number, and aro strung togother on & ring passing throngh holes on the left side. Each plato measures 6" by 3*: The weight of the plates and the ring is about 80 tolas. Tho edges of the plates bavo been raised into rims in order to protect the writing. The ends of tbo ring are soldered into a seal showing an elephant facing the left. Tho riog is oral and measuros 3" by 24". 
The inscription is in Sanskrit and is writton in proge and verse. It is not dated. The characters are South-Indian and closely resemble thobe found in other Ganga grants. The 
record the grant of two fields and a house to & Brähmana named Somašarman in the time of the Ganga king Vijayāditya. The grant was shown to me como years ago, and I have since obtained the plates on loan through Mr. D. R. Bbandarkar, for the purpose of editing them, (K. B. P.] 
This grant belongs to a series of spurious grants of the Western Gangas, which have been most extensively dealt with by Dr. Floet, and whioh havo beon treated as genuine by Mr. Rice, whose theory would, 0.9., lead to such results as that the king Durvinita, whose time would have beon the end of the 5th century, wrote a commentary on at least ono Surga of tho Kirātārjuniya, though soarcely anybody would place Bharavi earlier than the first half of the Cth century. 
The reasons for contesting tho gonuity of theso rocords have been ably put forward by Dr. Fleot, and thuy fully apply to the prosent grant.

The language is fa rly correct. There are however some mistakes and slips. Compare the forras vakts ilusalo, 1. 6; vaktriprayoktrikusuló, l. 22, and the Kanareso termination of the numeral trimeattu, l. 55. 
In common with the other sparious grants, the present one also describes Sriporusha as the grandson of sivamära, though we know from the Vallimalai inscription' that he was bis son. 
As has already boon stated by Dr. Flest, the fact that these grants are forgorios doos.net preclude the possibility that they may oontain somo historical facts. Dr. Fleet has discussed the various details mentioned in them in his paper on the Sūời plates, and tho krant here ondor consideration does not add much now information. The first of the Ganga kings, whose existence is known from authentic records, is the Mahiraja Kongapi sivamäre with the biruda Navakāma, whom Dr. Fleets places in tho period about A.D. 755.765. It has already boen romarked that the Mahardja Pfithivikongani Sripurusha, who is in the spuriods plates describod « leis grandaon, was in reality his son. According to Dr. Floot, his tino is About A.D. 765-805. We know from googine inscriptions that he also had tho namo Muttarasa. We learn from 1. 48 that ho had a queen Vijayamabidovi of the Chalikyn familo. If this statement is correct, we can only think of the Eastern Châlakyas of Vangi. In itself this is not at all unlikely. 
a is not at all unlikely. We know that the Garga's had boon dependent on the Western Chalakyas,* and the family can scarcely havo lost all its prestige with them on its overthrow at the bands of the Rashtrakatas. Moreover, the Eastorn Chālakya king who was contemporary with Muttarasa, was Vishịugurilhaga IV. (763-799), who was the father of Vijayaditya II. and the son of Vijayāditya 1. The name Vijayamabidēvi would be s very likely one for a Chålakya princoss of tho80 days, who would then probably have boen & sister of Vishnuvardhana. Mattarasa's eldest son was apparently Sivamära II," who was go bolled after his patergal grandfather, but who is not mentioned in our grant. His younger brother. the son of Vijayamahadevi, who wore the nnmo of his mother's father Vijayaditya. if the supposed grantee of our plates. This Vijayaditya is not au invention of the forger or forgors who are responsible for the sparious Gaága grants. His name occurs in an inscription at saadi in the Kadar district, but we do not know much about him. He probably resided at Asandi, now a village in the Kaçar T&alluqa of the Kndur Distriot, Mysore, situntod in 130 A N. and 76° 0 E., 5 miles from Ajjampur railway station This place is stated to have been his rosidonoe ia I. 54, and the grant purports to have boon issued in his 30th year. That does not however help us to establish the dato intended, booduse nothing prevents as from 48suming that he ralod in Asandi as vioeroy under his father. 
The objeots of the grant were two plots of land, a house, and something else in the neighbourhood of 1.8aadi. I cannot mako anything of Satprasada in l. 58. The donee was

No. 11.-- KINSARIYA INSCRIPTION OF DADHICHIKA (DAHIYA) CHACHOHA. 
(VIKRAMA) SAMVAT 1056. By PANDIT RAMAKARNA, JODHPUR. 
. This inscription wag discovered in a temple dedicated to the godders Kéváy mitā and situated on the commit of a hill in the vicinity of a village namod Kipsariya, 4 miles north of Parbatsar, the principal town of the district of the same name in the Jodhpur State. It is ingised on a stono fixed in the wall of the sabhimandapa. The inscription is edited from two estampages kindly supplied by Mr. D, R. Bhåpsårkar, Superintondent, Archæological Survey. Western Circle. 
The inscription contains 23 lines of writing covering & space of l' 104" broad by 11" bigb The writing is in & rather poor state of preservation, and lines 1, 22 and 23 are well-nigh destroyed. The characters of this inscription belong to the porthorn class of alphabets. The Jetters ", a, ksi, , ksh, and bh are exactly identical with those of the Bijapur inscription of the Rashtrakūta prince Dhavala. Attention may be drawn to the somewhat archaio form of : ocourriog for instance in sa-chittra-kriyah in line 6. The language of the insoription is throughout Sanskrit, and the text is in verse excepting a fow words in line 22, which contain the data. In respect of orthography the following points deserve notice : (1) all consonants following have been invariably doubled ; (2) roles of para-savarna havo not been observed in their entirety ; (3) the sign for u is also used for b; (4) y has been wrongly doubled in-yyodhan (1.3). It is worthy of note that the letter chh has been used in lines 5 and 12 to indi ate the conclusion of a subject in hand. 
The first verse has altogether peeled off. The next four verses invoke the blessings respectively, of (1) a goddoss whose name is lost (v. 2), (2) Katyayani (v. 3) and (3) Käll (v. 4-5). Verse 6 bestows praise on the Chahamána race. There lived a prince nainod Våkpatirăja (v.7) who, as we know from & copper-plate grant of V.8. 1219,8 raled over Sākambhari (Sambhar). Vorge 8 is in praise of Våkpati, but contains nothing historical. He was suoceeded by his son Sinharāja (ve. 9-10) who is spoken of as naya-sútra-yuktah, which expression probably here means that he was well versod in Logic. From Simharăja språng Durlabharăja (v, 11) who earned the epithet of Durlaoghyamēru, as none of his enemies could transgress bis orders. Verse 12 represents him as having conquered the country called Asosittana (perhaps Risosittana). Verse 13 narrates the exemplary philanthropy of Dadhichi Rishi who gave away the bonos of his own body, and then inforas us that princes doboended from him were known by the name of Dadbiohika, which, no doubt, is the same as Dahiyaka of line 22. In this race there was a person named Möghangda (v. 14). Verse 15 bestows nothing but conventional praise upon him. The name of his wife was Mābata (v. 16). He was succeeded by his son Vairisimba (v. 17-18). His wife was Dund. (v. 19). From him aprang Chaohoba (v. 20). The verse following is purely eulogistic, and verse 29 is in praise of dharma or religion. Then in verse 23 we are told that he built “this" temple of Bhavini, " this," of course, referring to the edifice where the insoription is engi gond named Yagahpushta and Oddharana (v. 24). Verse 25 expresses & wish for the permanenoe of the temple. The prasasti was composed by a Gauda Kayastha named Mahadeva, son of Śri-Kalya, who was a poet (v. 26). The date of the insoription given in line 22 is the 3rd of the brigbt fortnight of Vaišākha of V.8. 1066. As this line has been injured, a

KINSARIYA INSCRIPTION OF DADHICHIKA.

.. 
few words only can be read ont, of which kulan Dahiyakan jatain are olear enough; but no SODBO OAD bo made out from the rest. The live following, 1.6. the last lind, is well nigh illogiblo, 
We thus see that the insoription belongs to the roigo of a prince called Chaohoha, and that he was a fendatory of Durlabharaja of tbe imperial Chåhamada dynasty reigning at Sambhar. It deserves to be repeatod that Chachola is spoken of as belonging to tho Dadhichika dynasty, which is also callod Dabiyakı. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that he was what is popularly known as a Dahiya Räjput. The following remarks regarding the Dahiyas may be quoted from the Mārwär Censas Report of 1891: 
"Some people hold that Dahiyås are the one-half race that goes to complete the thirteen and a half racos of Rathors. They onco ruled over Parbatsar and Jilor, but now they are scattered here and there. The old fort of Jålor was constructod by tho Dahiyas. Thoy now abonnd in the districts of Jalor, Bäli, Jaswantpuri, Pūlı, Siwüņa, Sanchor and Malläni. They obsou ve widow marriage and they aro not regarded as of equal positiou with othor Rūjpūts." 
But a detailod and more reliable account of this clan is contained in Mati Nôgsi's chronicle. & summary of which will úot hero be out of place : 
The original seat of the Dahiya Rajpats is reportod to be a fortress named Thilnôr situated 'on the banks of the Godavari noar modern Näsik, wbonce they migrated into Márwar. In the 
Ajmor province they hold the following placo, (1) tho Dorivar-Parbateur villages, (2) Sávar-Ghatiyāli, (3) Harsor, aud (4) Märnt also callod Vilapaviti. All thu four villagos lie in the north-eastern part of Märwir. They also owned villages in tho south western part as well, viz. Jälor aud Säucho... Sinohor is said to laro been conquorod by Vijayo. si with the aid of an ally, the Vigholā Mahirk vana (sinter's son of Vijairājn), from the Dabiyü Vijairāja in S. 1142. This event is recorded in a verse quotud be:ow: 
धरा धूण धकचाल, कीध दहिया दहब? । सबदी सबला साल, प्राण भवास पह? ॥ 'पालण सुत विजयसी, वंस पासराव प्रागवड़ । 
खाग त्याग खत्रवाट, सरण विजे पंजर सोड़ ॥ चावांण राव चौरंग पचल, नरांनाह प्रणभंग नर । ध मेर सेस जां लग प्रचल, ताम राज साचोर धर ॥ १ ॥ 
Mata Nöpsi also gives a list of tho Dahiya princes who reiguod round about Parbatorr and Murot. He mentions Dadhicha as one of their ancostors and specifics thcir names as fullows from the 26th prince onwards : 
No 27 Raba Ráno (who inhabited Rohadi), No. 28 Kadava Rapo. No. 29 Kiratasi Råus No. 30 Vairasi Rapo. No. 91 Chicha Riuo (who raised a temple on a bill in the village of Sipahadiya). No. 82 Anuvi Udharaya (who ruled ovor Parbatsar and Maint). 
It will be seen that the names Vairasi, Chicha, Udharana of this list (Nos. 30-32) exactly correspond to Vairisitiba, Chachcha, and Uddharaya of our inscription. The list, Chovorer,

gives Kiratasī as the naino of Vairasi's father, whereas he is callod Möghapada in our inscription. But thoro is nothing to proclude thu sopposition that Moghadăda and Kiratasi (Kirttisimaha) woru two nomnus of one and tho same princo, as instances are not wanting of kings known by more than one name. Chacha Rápo, as we have just soon, is described in Mūtā Nanai's chronicle as having built templo on a hill in the village of Siņahadiya, which scoms to be an old namo of Kipsariya. The epithet Anati, which is coupled with Uddharana, appears to be a corruption of anumri, moaning “upbending," He was szocoeded by Jagadhara Råvata, who ruled over Parbatsar. Ho constructed a temple, dug a stop-poll and a well in village Mandala 2 miles from larbatsar. His second son was Vilbana, who wielded sway ovor the whole district of Mirot, which is, up to the present day, callod Vilanaväti. He asod to reside in the village of Depāri situated on a hill and 4 miles from Marot, whero an old fort and a tank still exist. Some Dahiyas aro still called Döpāri-Dahiyas after this village. Of the succeeding gonorations, Bilki (No.34) constructed a tank called Bibasar in Parbatsnr, and Hamira (No. 35) was a great warrior. His deeds aro beautifully described in the following porses : 
महाकाल जमजाल जोधार जैमबरौ, काल्हरौ कथन संसार कहियो । दुरत पतसाहरै साल हो दूदड़ो, दूदड़ा तणे उर साल दहियो ॥१॥ निवड़ भड़ निडर नरनाह नरबहरी, सकज भड़ स्यामरौ काम सधीर । हियै पतसाह साल हाडो हुवी, हिये हाडातणे साल हमीर ॥२॥ पावरत कहर प्रसवार पाखाडसिध, काम पहचान इधकार कीयो । दूदडै दूठ पतसाह प्रोसुख दियो, दुरत दूदा उर साल दहियौ ॥३॥ 
There is a number of pütlis or figures of satis in au enclosure adjoining the tomple contain ing this inscription. One of these figures bears the following epitaph in the form of an inscrip tion, dated V. S. 1300, of Vikrama, son of Kirtisinha Dahiya : 
संवत् १३०० ज्येष्ठ सुदि १३, सोमदिने रा श्री दधि कीसी(कीर्ति सिंह) सुत रा श्री विकम्ब(विक्रम) रात्री-नाइलदेविसहितो(तः) स्वर्गलोके गत[:*] रा श्री पुत्र जगधरेन (ण) पिता माता अर्थे (मातापिनोरथे) क(का)रापितः । सु()भं भवतु (1) मंगलं महा 
This shows that Dahiyas held this part of the country for nearly 300 years, is. up to 1300 V.S. T'he use of tho letter rī (which is but an abbreviation of rāja) buforo Kirtisim ha and the word queen (rajni) for his wifo shows that Kirtisimha was a ruling prince and not an adal Rūjpūt. Thu Dahiya kings mentionod in our inscription weru chieftains, no doubt feudatory to the Chalı-nang overlorda, bnt also wielding way over a tract of country. This fact is again corroborated by the following abstract from an inscription of V.S. 1272 discovered in Mangalapa in the Mūrot district : 
___दधीचवंशे महामंडलेश्वर श्रीकदुवराजदेवपुत्र श्रीपदमसीहदेवसुत महाराज पुत्र श्री जयतस्य(सिंह

No. 12.--NAMMURU GRANT OF AMMA RAJA II. 
BY PROFESSOR E. THULTZSCI, PH.D.; HALLE (SAALR). 
Ink-impreasions of this inscription were sont to me by Rao Sahib II. Krishna Sastri, who had received the original plates from Mr. G. V. Appa Rao, B.A., of Vizianagram, 
As Mr. Krishna Sastri informod me, these are three coppor-plates with ring and seal. The platos measuro roughly 41" by 9f". The ring is " in thicknoss, and the circolor seal 24 in diameter. The first and third plates benr writing only on thoir inner side, and the second plate on both sides. The four inscribed sides have their rita raised for the protoction of the writing. The seal bears, in relief on a countorsunk surface, a boar, a crescent, and an elephant road inn line, below them the legend tri-Tribhuvanā musa, and bolow this a floral device. The bottom of the seal is fixed into an olongated lotus flowor with oight petals. 
The writing on the platos is in a state of nearly perfect prcscrvation. The alphabet resembles that of other insoriptions of Amma II. The jihorimulkya occurs onco (line 29), and the upadhmaniya five times (11.6, 20 [twico]), 23 twice]); it is identical. in sbape with the

Telugu ņ of - Kandervādi- (, 21). A final form of n is employed in 11.7, 11, 30 (wrongly for m)', and ono of m in 11, 4, 5, 9, 29, 32. The length of i is generally marked by a point in the centre. of the circle which represents tho secondary form of i. The superscribed T, if combined with, the lattor, is expressod by a slight indenture on the right of the cirola (11, 15, 18). 
Tho language of the inscription is Sanskrit, proso apd verse : five yoraes are insorted in the nanegyriell introduction, and two of tho usual imprecatory verses at the end of the documont. 
The description of tao boundarios in 11. 27-28 is in a mixture of Sanskrit and Tolagu. 
The record opens with the usual gonoalogy of the Eastorn Chalukya family (1. 4) from Kubja-Vishnuvardhana to Ammarāja II. (1. 19). Vijayāditya II. surnamed Narēndra mpigarīja is stated io verso 1 (1.9) to have reigned for forty years, whilo, with a slight variation at the end of tho samo verse, another grant of Amma II. allots to him a reign of forty-cight yoald, Verse 2 (Il. 13-16) reports that Bhima II., tho younger brother of Ammarāja I. by a difforont mother, expelled his predecessor Yuddhamalla from the country and ruled for twelvo, years. The thiroo noxt verses praiso Amma II., his son by Lökamahādovi (v. 3), in general terms. Tho two first of thoso vorses are already known from other inscriptions; the third (v. 5) contains the following fanciful statement : 
While this lord of the carth is proccoding to view the gardens. ontaide (hin palace), tho frightened lords of the countrios (lying) in that direction are offering (him) jewels, gold, horses, noblo clophants, and foot-soldiers." 
LI. 19-26 rocord that she who bore the glorious samamo Ammarāja (II.), Samastabhuva.. nasrayı, thu glorions Vijayaditya (VI.) Maharījalhiraja-Parametara Paramabhattdraka, tho very pious one," informs the inhabitants of the Gudla-Kaņdervidi district (vishya) that, at the occasion of a winter-solstice (uttarāyana, 1. 25), hu bas granted a field in the villago named Nammüru to the loarued Vishansarman, who resided at Gēranda and was the son of Chamyang Barman and the grandson of Vishnušarman of the Kasyapa golra. The field lay to the east of tho village and roquirod as seed twolve khandikis of grain (kolrava) ' by the royal mousuro (1. 
26). 
Tbo boundaries of the field are spocified in II, 27-28 : "In the oast the boundary (is) a pond with a domarcation stones. In the south tho boundary (is) the very boundary of the panruusa * of Pandi-Peddēri. In the west, the eastern boundary of Kroppéru. To the north, the Indula-guncha." 
I am unablo to id'ntify any of the localities mentioned in this giant. With the diatriot of Gudla-Kandorvāại may be compared Kapdețuvādi-vishaya, Uttara-Kandoruvādi-visbaya, and Doddi-Kundravūậi in othor inscriptions of tho Telugu country.8

No. 13.-.-NIDHANPUR.COPPER PLATES OF BHASKARAVARMAN. By Professor PADMANATHA BHATTACHARYA VIDYAVINODA, M.A., GAUHATI. 
ONI LAULT 
ICIARY 
YAYINOD 
On the 29th December 1912, a Musalman cultivator of the villago Nidhanpar, in Panoha khanda, Sylhet, while lovelling down a mound for making a buffaloe-shod, discovored there copper platos, fastened together by a ring, with a heavy soal shaped like tho hoad of a ladlo. He thought that the plates contained somo information about hidden treasnre, but whon he brought it to a local land-holder, the latter at once recognized tho whole as a copper-plato grant and sont it to be photographed to Silolar. Through the kindnoss of Rabu Dinanath Dus, B.A. of the Commissioner's offico, Silchar, the plates were placod at my disposal for abonta month, and after having read them, I wrote two Articles on thom, ono of which was read on tho 5th May 1913 in the Anniversary Meeting of the Sahitya Parishada at Rangpur, Bengal, and the otber on the 25th May 1913 in tho 1st Annual Moeting of the Kämeräpa Aqusandhānn Samiti (Historical Research Society) at Gauhāti, Assam. The present article is tlo substanco in English of the two articles that I wroto in Bengali for the litorary societies moutionod above, 
The graat was issuod by Bhāskaravarman, king of Kamerūpa, whom wo have lithoto known from two differont sources, the Thirrshacharita of Bānabliatta and the lIsi-Yü-chi of Yuan Chwang, who paid a visit to the capital of Bhāskaravarman in 013 A,D, whilo on pilgrimaw in India. It was issued from bis camp at Karnasuvarna. Two main problems present thema wolves boforo us at thio ontset, (1) How and when Karņusu vilriņa, which is found soparstoly mentioned in Yuan Chwang's book, came undor tho stay of Bhāskaravurman, and (9) Whether or not Sylhot formod part of thio kingdom of KĀmarūpa, aud, if not, how the plates could be found in a placo within the district of Sylhet. 
But boforo taking up theso points vo futet first of all ascertain the locality of Karna savarna. This is a matter in which Doctors are found to disngroe ; but as it has been fully discussed in Mr. Watters' Yuan Chwang', and as wo fully accept the conclusions arrived at there, we nood not dilato on the subjcct any further. 
The kingdom of Kaiņasuvaiņa vas contiguous with the kingilom of Kāmaripa, apesa Yuan Chwang reached Karnaan varje travelling south-east from Panndravardhana, ind Kämnaripa travelling east from laundravardhana, Karnayuvarna was connuquently south of Kimari pa, and in the map attached to Mr. Wuttors' Yuan Chwang, it has been shown sonth. west of Kamarupa. Yuan Chwang moutions Saśānka as the late king of Karnasuvarya, and in the Harshacharita of Būna, the samo king has boon desiguatod us king of Ganda (i.. Paundril vardhana). Anyhow this ambitious and powerful monarch incurred thu animosity of Iloreba. vardbana, tho great king of Stlanvisvara (Thāņõsar) by killing his older brother Rajyavar. dhana in & mther treacherous way, and Bhaskara varman, the king of Kamarů pa, boing the ruler of a neighbonring torritory, was in constant droul of Sasanks, whoso aspiration as to become the parumount ralor in India. It is tho common rulo of politics that two kings, inimically disposed towards one and the same third power, should become friendly to each othor ; and 80 wo find, in the Harshacharita, that as soon alınost a8 Harshavardhana agsiune: the roins of the kingdom, an ambassador from Bhāskaravarman approached Harsla with valuablo presonts in ordor to win the friendship of the grent monarch. Although tho to Inonarchs were thus united in a bond of friondship alınost at the commoncement of tho roign

of Flarsha (about 606 A.D.), they could do no material injury to the king of Karnasuyarna, for a very long tinie afterwards we find Saśānka in power, ia 619 A.D. Nor did Sabadka dio in battle. Yuan Chwang, who paid a visit to Karnasuvarna, believod that Gajanka died of sono fonl discuso due to his iniquitous persocation of the Buddhists and his demoli. tion of the statues and tom ples of the Buddha. After tho death of Sasād ka his kingdom must bare passed into the hande of Harxha, who was then in the zenith of his power. Fann Chwang in the description of his visit to Karnasuvarna does not make mention of any king reigning thoro. We can presame therefore that it was thon absorbed into the 'inpiro of Harsha, who could not havo allowed the possessions of so great a rival to the included in the territory of Bhāskaravarman, a weakor king to all appearance, however friendly he might havo boon. It is only on the dixmomberment of tho great ompire of Harsba shortly after his demise, tbat it was possible for Bhāskaravarman to got any hold over Karnasuvarpa. As a matter of fact Bhaskara, who sirvived his great friend Hargha, rendered valuable assistance to the powerful Chiuere invader Wang-ligen-tsi (in 648-49 A.D.) who orushed the nsurper Arjuna, the minister of Harsba, who had ascended the throno after his domise. We may assume that Bhāakaravarman was rewarded with the possession of Karnasuvarna, and it may be that in commemoration of his trininphant entry into the capital of Karnabuvarna this shrewd king of Kāmarüpa mado this grant of land to a Brāhman of the locality. 
The original copper platos were however soon burnt, but they wore forthwith ronewed most probably by the donor himself. The fractured, bent and dofaced seal_which was apparently not ronowodtostifies this fact, which is alluded to in the first vorse of the renewed inscriptions and expressedly stated in the last verse. 
Let us now tako up the socond point, whother Sylhet formed part of Bhāskaravarman's torritory, and if not, how tho plates conld be found thero. This questiou would not havo arisen at all if the inscription wero completo ; unfortunately the 3rd plate is missing along with the record of the locality of the land anii (probably also) of the domicile of the Brāhman who got the grant. If there ware any mention of Sylhet--where the plates have been found it would huve boon unquestionably takon for granted that Sylhet forured part of the kingdom of Kamatipa during the 7th century A.D), when Bhāskaravarman flourished, and if there were no mention of Sylhot, then the question of Sylhet in this connection would have been out of place. As we havo already said, the grant, issued from tho comp Karpasuvarna, most have related to a locality within the jurisdiction of that territory. 
The fact that the copper plates havo been found in Sylhet doos not prove that the land must have belonged to that district. The copper platos inscribod under the orders of Vaidyam dova, kiay of Kāmaripa,' were found in Kanuali near Bonares City, and the plates now under consideration can have been similarly transferred. The loss of the third plato is also remarkablo; the threo existing plates have been found tightly fastened by the ring, so that the loss of the missing pinto must have occurred bofore the existing onos could have come over to tive place they bavo beon fonnd in. Perhaps tho owner of the coppor plato grant was diapos. sessed of his bolongings in the course of one of the political revolutions--many of whioh have

gogu pred subseqpent to Bhaakara's time, quitted his original home and oame to the sparsely peopled part of Sylhet, and, wishing for some rdasons to concoml his original status iung away the plates that containod a record of the same, and booane easily absorbud into the society of this new place. 
This theory-though only a surmisewill be supported, if we can prove that Sylhot Dover at least during the days of Bhaskaravarman, belonged politically to Kamarapa. Several con siderations lead me to this conclusion : 
1. While travelling in India, Yuan Chwang went from Kumaripa southwards to Samatata and before turning back from Samatata, he got information of cortain regions one of which was Shihlichatolo. This has been taken to moan Srikshatra, and Mr. Watters and Mr. Vincent A. Smith havu ta ken groat pains to localize it, but our Bongali writers of historical books have found no difficulty in identifying Shillichatolo with Srihaçţa. In fact what the people whom Yuan Chwang consulted muid was cortajaly Srihacir, which tho pilgrim heard as Srikshairi and reproduced in his defoctivo Chinose tongue as Shihlichatolo. At any rato this poiats to the fact that Sylhet, which wond is a Musalman corruption of Srihalta, which is still used in Bengali existed independently of the kiugdom of Kimarüpa in Yuan Chwung's and, consequently, in Bhāskaravarman's time. 
2. The Sampradayika Brāhmans of Sylhot, who are said to have come from Mithila, bave genealogical accounts of their families. It is recorded thcruin that firo of their ancestors wore imported by a king of Tipperah in 641 A.D., and that the very locality where the platos have been found was allotted to those fiyo Brāhmaṇs-And so the place was called Pañchte khanda. This event took place two poars before Yuan Chwaug heard of Shihlichatolo, and although such gonealogical accounts are only to be accepted with roservation, yet thero can be no doubt that much of the eastern part of the district of Sylhet, including Pañchakharus the place of the find, belonged to the kiug of Tipperuh at that poriod. 
3. The name of Srihatta has very ouriously found its place in an inscription of a dute prior to Bhaskaryarman, viz., in the prašastim of the tople of Lakkha Mandal at Madha in the Jaunsar Bawar district. Just on the top of tho inscription, we read the word Srihalladhisvare. bhyah, and although Dr. Bübler, who road tho inscription and assigned to it a date about 600 A.D., was of opinion that those letters were "of a lator dato," they coald not, from their very nature, be of a very posterior date ; thoy were apparently inserted to fill in bomo omission. some whero in the inscription, and very probably the calligraphio difference is duo to a difforent bund that corrected the mistake. At any rate, it becomes evident that by 600 A.D. there was a place called Srihaļļa, which had its own adhišvaras (lords), 
But how is it that many of the historians, European and Indian, have aggertod that a part of East Bengal, to tho cast of the Brahmaputra river, including portious of Dacca and Mymon singh, Tipperah and Sylhet, belongod to Kamarupa p There are also spots in the western part of Sylhet and tho east of Mymonsingh which are pointed out by common poople as the place of Bhagadatta, the soa of Narak:t, the first king of Kamarúpa, who is mentioned in the prosent grant as well as io other ancient copper plates. Let us exomino if thore is any basis of truth in theso matters. It is stated in the Yoginitantra that. Kamnarüpa extpadod from the Kiñohana mountain

of Nepal up to the junction of the Brahmaputra, beginning from tho Karatoya up to the Dikkaruvariui, its boundaries boing, to the north, tho Kaõjagiri; to the wost, the Karatöyā, to the east, the Dikalu; to the south, the confluonce of the Brahmaputra with the Löksha. 
This description of Kimarāpa is also found in a few other sacred compositions. I think that what is moant is not the political territory, but a soriptural region, rondered sacred by the locution of Kāmākhyā (the presiding deity of Kámaräpa) in the centre. Similarly, such boundarios are given in the socond chapter of the Manu-Sanhita of Aryävarta, Brahmăvarta. etc. Moreover the boundary lino given in the Yoginitantra does not stand the test of a close bistorical scrutiny. Tho Yoginitantra contains the name of Visvasimha, the founder of the Koch kingdom which is now limited to Koch Bihar, and he was a contemporary of Babar and Humayan, In his days much of the torritory included within the boundary of Kimarüpa as defined in the Yaqinitantra especially what foll in East Bengal including Sylhot, had long come under the jurisdiction of the Pathans and the Moghuls. Now whon Yuaag Chwang entered Kámarapa, he crossed a large rivor Kalotua by name, and this can only be the Karatoyå of the Yoyinilantra. Now from the fact that the western boundary of the Tantra coincidod with the political bound ary of Kämaropa, which can be inferred from Yuan Chwang's statement, the conclusion has boen somowhat hastily drawn that the Tantra was also right with regard to the remaining boundarios, at least for the days of Bbüskara varnan. 
Yogh to Koch Bibi yithin the bounding Sylhet, 
As to tho popular notion about Bhagadatta's place in Western Sylhet or Eastern Mymen singb, the fact that more than one spot, widely apart from each other, are boing identified as euch, throws a doubt on the inattor. It would seem that the name of Bhagadatta, who flourishod about 5,000 years ago, must have been somewhat vaguoly applied to casual invaders from Kamaruia in the middle ages, who camo down the Bralnaputra qod pitched their camps for a time in those spots and returned without gaining any permanent footing. 
This esplanation is also supported by the fact that even in the Yöginitantra the name Srihutia oucurs more tban once in such a way that au indopondent political ontity seems to be iudicated, though within the sacred procints of Kamarupa. 
The copper plates now under consideration contain tho most ancient record that has hitherto becu discovered in the province of Assam, and are also by far the most important document of all that relate to the ancient history of tho great kingdom of Kāmaräpa or Pragjyotisha. It contains tho numos of as many is twelve kings (and of unust of their queens also), who, even if wo reckon us inuch as fonr kings on a century, must havo ruled over. Kamarūpa from tho middle of the fourth to tho middlo of tho soventh century A.D. The uamos of the last five of them occur in the Ilurshacharita," and thus the one corroborates the other, although there are small litoral

It is an instanco of curious coincidenco that the first namo io this list should bogin with Pushya, as the foundors of two other very poworful dynasties had namos beginning with the same word. Pushyamitra was the first king of the Súrga dynasty, and Pushyabhatia was the name of tho first royal ancestor of the great Harshavardhana. The socoud in the list also

curiously onough corresponds in namo to the sooond king of the Gupta dynasty, vit. Samudra gapia (320-375), who was the most powerful Indian monarch that ever ruled India suftar Asoka. 
Two points in the above comparative lists are worthy of notice: in the Harshachurita the namo of the elder brothor of Bháskarvarman is not mentioned, probably because it was useless there, as, in the onumeration of ancostors, the name of the eldor brother does not come in." And the socond name of Bhaskarvarman, Kumāra, which is also mentioned in Yuan Cbwang's accouuts, has not found its place in tho inscription. We cannot however positively asort this, because tho names of the donor were contained in the plate which has been lost. The appella. tiou Kumārie moans a princo or a bachelor, and it is highly improbable that Bhaskaravarman would romnin unmarriod, in which case his dynasty of a very long standing would have como to an ond vith him. Perhaps he retainod the designation Kumāra, which he had before he bo came a king, in deference to the momory of his older brother, who probably did not eithor 
throne at all, or, if ho did, occupied it for a very short period. For similar reasona ][arshavardhaan is said by Yuan Chwangi to have assumed the name of Rajaputra Silāditya, though lator on he stylod himself Maharajadhiraja. 
Let us now canine the toxt of the inscription. The ononing vorso is perhaps an addition made while renowing the document, and so is the last verse ---of which inors afterwards. The original inscription would then havo began with Svusli, Mahd-nau-hasty-asva, just as the copper plates of Ilarshavardhana,? Then comes a verse in praise of Mabadova, and next a vorro ia praise of Dharma. This is somowbat remarkable, when we remomber that Dharma was the nccond of the three jowels (Tri-ratna) of the Buddbists. Yuan Chwang in his account of Kamarüpa found almost a total absence of Buddhism in Bhāskarvarnau's kingdom, and the latter's ambassador in tho Ilarshacharita clearly stated before Harsha that " from childhood upwards it was this prince's firm rosolation nover to do homage to any being except the lotus feet of Siva," 
Wo feel therofore more surprised at secing him sing tho glory of the Buddhistio divinity, though in a Hindi guiso, than at finding him issue the grant from his "glorious camp of Kar. puhuvarna." Probably the locality hud something to do with the pruixu of Dharma. Wo know from Yuan Chwang': duscription of Karpabuvarpa hat the place was teesuing with Buddhist statues and temples, Bbāskara, who had become liboral in views on account of his long a880 giation with the great Harsha who was a patron of the Buddhists, tried porhaps to gaia popa larity by this insertion of a passing tribute of rempoot paid to the looal oreadthongh in a , vory careful way. 
Then, us wis nenal with the medieval kings of Kamarupa who claimed descent from Narakı, the uamos of that king and his son Bhagadatta and his grandson Vajradatta are mentioned. Curiously enough, in some of the later copper plates Vajradatta is mentioned as a brother of Bhagadatta. The writera of those inscriptions, who wore probably very learned people, must havo somowhore found Vajradatta mentioned as a brother of Bhagadatta. In the Kalikapurana, bowovor, we have a list of the sons of Naraka, who were four in number-Bhaga datta, Mahasirala, Madavat aud Sumálin. Vajradatia doos not ooour in that list. Similarly

Mr. Gait, in hia History of 488cm (p. 14), has, on the othor hand, adopted the vorsion of the later copper platos whon ho says : This king (Bhagadatta), it is said, Wils succeeded by his brother Bajradatta, and tho lattor by his son Bajrapani.' I do not know whoro ho bas got this last king-Vajrapāņi-from, 
The inscription then goes on to inform us (v. 7) that after Vajradatta his descendants governed for three thousand years, and then Pushyavarman bocama king. Thon follows tho enumeration of his immodiate successore down to Bhaskaravarman, tho king who issued tho grant. He is praised in vv. 22-25 and in the ensuing prose passago, but part of the panegyrio on him has been lost, owing to the disappearance of the third plate. Tho last plato, now the third, opens in the midst of the description of the boundaries of the land granted; then follow the names of some offiours, eviduntly such as had something to do with tho grant and the document. Then come a couple of the customary versos praising a donor of lam and carsing those who might take it away, Ilore onda the original inscription. But an additional verko has been added at the end, indicating that the plates had beon burnt and rewritton which now writing should not thoroforo, be looked on as forged. 
. The question as to when and by whom this doou mont was renewed, is probably not of great importance. I havo already said that, in my opinion, the renewal was probably mado by the donor himsolf; for, us stated in Mr. Gait's invaluable History of Assam", tho dynasty of Bhāskaravarman was soon after his tine overthrown by a barbarian Salastambha by namo. Moreover, if somebody elgomoyon his successor-ronowed the gront, his namo would have been incidentally mentioned in the renewed inscription in an additional verse. 
Yuan-Chwang bas describod Bhāskaravarman as a Brāhmun. Probably his descent from Näräynna Döva and his staynch adherenoo to the Brahmanical oreed, end possibly also the fact that he personatod Brahma-the fountain hear of all Brälmaņg-in the procession of Harsha vardhana who hiniselt figured as Sakra, led the Chinoso traveller to this conclusion. On the other hand, Mr. Vincent A. Smith has assorted that “almost certainly he (Bhaskara) must have been # hinduisod Knch aborigine." The inscription ander review is not in favour of this assumption. As a matter of fact, fow kings of mediæval and anoient India conld show anch a brilliant record of illustrious ancestors : Naraka, though styled an Asura for his iniquities, was a mighty monarch whose exploits wore recorded in various Parāṇas, who was the issoo of oue incarnation of Vishna (Varaha), and killed by another (Brikrishna); Bhagadatta played a very prominont part in the story of tho Mahābhāra ta ; Vajradatta was as horoic as

It is of interont to note that these two verses, which are taken from the Brihaspati Samhita, occitr in almost all the copper plate grants of the Bengal kings, but are absont from all other Agaam plutes bitherto published, 
The only exception is the grant of Vaidyedova (Ep. Ind., Vol. II, pp. 847 ff.), who, howover, was origiually the minister of the Bengal king Kumărapăla, and not an indigenous king of Kamarupa.

his father and then, although no other king of the dynasty was extolled by name, yet the poet Kūlidõsa in his Raghuvarsa did not consider bis bero glorified until he was honoured by the king of Kāmarupa,' and Raghu's son treated his compoer of Kamarupa as his " best man" whilo marrying the danghter of the king of Vidarbha. It has already beer atated that a position of bonour was given by the emperor of Argāvarta (Harshavardhana) to Blāskara hiinself in tho state procession at Rā jngriha. The mason was net so much that Jie was a powerful king, as the high lineage that made him at once the most respectable among the hosts of the crowned heads of Northern Iudia who came to attend Darsha's ceremonies. 
The composer of tho inscriptions was no doubt a learned man, but his poetry was pot of a very high order. Ho selected a metre, Arya, for his verses which is not much rythmical, and the prone in the description of the royal donor's attributes is in the style of Banabhatta, who lived at tho court of Harshavardhana. Even bis aso of the Argā would be found dofectivo if tested by the rules of the various ganas given in the prosodical treatines. But the short coming of the poet that way was mado np by his knowledge of grammatical spooialities and rhetorical wabtleties. His special forte sconis to havo been the flesha, which he has sono timos carried to excess. 
de to the mechanical execution of the copper plates, it may be said that although tbe letters are fairlo distinct the inscription abounds in mistakes, which havo boon shown in the footnotas suttached to the text. There was no distinction mado betwoen ba and 111, and this confusion also recurs in otlior copror platos of Kamarüpa discovered up to date. In the vernacular of modern Kamarúm (ir. Assamese), thoro in at present a sort of distinction observed in writing and pro Rimeing those two letters, but in the rorfachlar of modoru Karnasuvarpa (s.e. Bongali) there is no distinction whatever between the two. There aro frequent omnissions of the Anusvara and the l'isary; compare 11, 1, 7, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25, 30, etc., whero tho Anusvára has loen loft out, sind Il. 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, etc., where the l'isarya has been omittod. 
There are also other instances of carelessness. Thus we find a sor i in rabila-, 1. 39: :-117.kulpt., 1. 3); ripherita-. 1. 40; a for u in sratu., l. 42, and 9 for o in uuya., l.

The last plate abounds in inistakes ind omissions, and contrins, moreover, several curions word. The ontting of the letters is sometimes nusatisfactory. More especially, the lop at the bottom of the aksharu silconsists of two strokes, one going downwards and the atber lackwards. There aro on the whole some featares which would, in ordinary circum rtances, throw doubt on tho genuinouo88 of the plates. As has alroady been mentioned. however, the drvå at the end of the last plato informs us that the original plates were burnt. and that the grant contained in the existing plates is a copy. It is also stated that the shape of the letters differs from the original, but that the contouts aro gonnine. There is no reason to compel is to doght this statement, which, if we admit its correctness, Accounts for the peculiarities drawn attention to above. Tho alphabet usod assigna tho platis to about A.D. 600, uod it is rory likely that Profissor Paämanatha is right in thinking that the renewal of the burut plate: took place not much later.-S. K.)

It is very clever of the author that speaking of the Sänknya here he brings in Purusha and Prakriti in the next vorse. 
There are fivo mahābhūtas and the king is likoned to a sixth ono. Here the similo is a little faulty, Mahabhütas ar not the immediato progeny of prakriti, us was the king of Dévavati. Out of prakrili was evolved mahat, thenco ahankara, whence five tanmätras and therofrom the mahabhtitas.

BY PROFESSOR 11. JACOBI, PH.D., Bonn. 
My Planetary Tables", which are banod on the Sirya Siddbānta without bīja, serve to calculate the position of planots for any date between 300 and 2000 A. D. in order to verify thu constellation of the plant ts, or a horoscopo, given in an inscription or any othor document. For this purpose we must caloplate the true Longitude of the planots according to the elements of Hindu Astronomy. Our orloulation yields the Longitude in degrees ; from this we find in what sign the planot was, by dividing tho Longitude by 30. The quotient given tho aambor of completod signs; the remainder, the place in the running sign, 6.g. 315° 29' Longitudo of Jupiter is equal to 10 signs 15° 23', or: Jupiter was in the 11th sign, Kumbha, and had reached 
15° 23' in it. 
The tables yield the requirod quantities for dates of the Christian Calondar, in old style from 300-1699, and in new style from 1700-2000. There are five tables. 
Tables I-III together yield the mean Longitude of the five planets and the son; tables IV and V furnish the equations which must be joined to the mean Longitude of a planet to convort it into true Loqgitude. 
Table I gives the mean Longitude of tho five planets and the Sun for the beginning of the corresponding year of the twentieth contury A.D., s.e. for the year in the twentieth century A.D. which is separated from the given yoar by one up to sixteen completo contarios; e. g. 1917 is the corresponding year of 317, 417, 517, 617, oto. ; 1956, of 956, etc. (The lettor L. aftor 1956 indicatos tbat the year was a leap year.) Tablo II gives the incronse in Longitudo for the centuries intervening between the given year and the corresponding year; e.g. for 1517 A.D. we asb the Index 400 and add the items entered against this Index to those found in table I for 1917.

The items tnkon fro'n the tables I-III should be adiled together; the soveral soms are the mean Longitudes of the planets for the beginning of the dry (mean suoriso at Lankā); 6.g. for 
the 13th April 1168 A.D. our calculation stands as follows: 
Mercury. Vepus. Mars. Jupiter. Saturn. Sun, 1948 A.D. . 281° 50' 159° 49' 324° 51' 123° 51' 349° 156 256° go 500 Years. , 197 52 233 39 218 21 200 20 309 28 19 43

llaring thus fonnd the mean Iongitudes of the 5 planots, we must convert thom into true Longitudes. This is rather a woarisomo process which requires four calculations for each planet: the process is not tho sanno for all planots, but Morcary and Vonus are differently tronted l'rulu Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In these calculations Tables IV & V, called Commutation and Anomalistic Tablos, are to be used as will be explained in the Rules to be given prosently. Particnlor care should, however, be given to tho sign of the equations : if the argument is found in the first column (ou tho left side), the oquation is positivo; if it is in the last coluinn (on the right sight), it is negativo. 
Rules for converting mean Longitude into true Longitude.

Hints for Caloulation. he year in whioh a given constellation occurred in known, but the exact date is not stated the best way to proceed for finding approximately the date of the given constellation is the following. The sign in which the Sun stande direotly gives the solar month, 6.g. Sun in Mosha indicates solar Vaisakha. First calonlato new moon in the solar month thus found. Bly general Tables furnish the solar date of new moon; 8.9. in 1168 A.D. it cooarred o 16th solar Vaisakha. The place of the moon at now moon is the same as that of the Sun ia tho sign assigned to the latter, and approximately the degree which both laminaries are stationed at has the same numbor ss the solar date ; in our example Mesha 16° Now it is easy to find approximately the place in which the moon is after a given number of days. For the moon by her mean motion travels 13° 10' each day. For easier calculation I have drawn up the follow ing small tablo which shows the motion of the moon in 28 succossive days or the period of her sidereal rovolation, 
days. 
In our last example new moon occurred on the 16th solar Vaibakha ; when did the moon enter Vrisha and how long did she remain in that sign? As Vrisha covers the part of the Ecliptia from 30° to 60, it will be seen that she entered Vrisha on the next day. For new moon occurred in Mösba 16° and there are 14° of Mosha left;. she will be in Vrisha for two days more. To give another example, let us suppose that the era stood in Mithuda, the moon in Dhands, and new moon ocourred on the 20th solar Ashādba ; the problem is how many days before or after the 20th Ashādha occurred the above constellation of Sun and Moon. New moon on 20th Aahadha is in space : Mithuna 200, or 80° Lougitado ; Dhanus is from 240° to 270° Longitude. To

wanna 
reach the beginning of Dhanua the moon has to travel 240°-80o=160°, which takos her between 12 and 13 days as shown by the above table. She is, therefore, in Dhapus about 12 days after the 20th Abhädba, or about the 2nd solar Brävapa (Karkata). Bat by this time the San has enteri Karkata, sinoe her daily motion is about one degree. Accordingly the constellation is bo mote the one proposed we must select that time before the new moon on 20th Aahadha When the moon bad been in Dhanus, or 28 days before the 2nd Árivaņa, vit. the 4th solar Ash&dha. The day indicated by the given constellation of Sun and Moon is, therefore, the 4th Bolar Apådhå or one of the two next. For calculation it would be beat to select the 5th solar Aradha, balonlate the true Longitude of the moon, as oxplained in the General Tables, and Belect the definitive day accordingly. 
%. If the year in which a given constellation occurred is not known, we can find it approximately from the signs in whioh Jupiter and Saturn aro stated to have been. For as a revolation of Japiter reqaires 12 years and one of Saturn 28 years, tho samo constellation of both planets will recur in about 12 x 28 = 336 years. This would be our chance if the degreos of the Jupitor'and Saturn's places in their respective signs were statod. But ugnally only the signs are given, and in that case wo may expoot a recurrence of the same constellation in abont 59 or 60 years. In order to find the periods in which Jupiter and Saturn stood in any given sigus, I havo constructed Tables vim viii. They are based on the Kaliyuga ora and mean Bolar years. The places of both planets, their mean Longitudes, are expressed in figures, of which the integers denote completo signs, and the decimals the fraction of the runoing sign. Thus 4.65 denotes that the planet stood in the fifth sign (counting from Mosha), via, Simba, and had gone through 0.65 of it. The working of the tables will be best understood by an examplo. 
Dæample.-Given Jupiter in Sinha (5th siga), Saturn in Dhanus (9th sign). Required the corresponding year of 44th century K. Y. 
Answer.The mean Longitude (according to the notation in these tables) was 4 : 4:00... 6.00; 8:00...9.00. 
· Rule.From the given Longitudes subtraot the corresponding ones for the Century under consideration, in table VI, if the given Longitude is smaller than the tabular value, add 12:00 to the former, and then subtract tabular value. 
viz. 4. 400 4:31 or 16.00 – 4:31 = 11.69 
n. 800 - 10-67 or 20.00 - 10.67 = 9.33 
These values mark the beginning of Simha for 4, and Dhanus for ñ ; the end of those signs are accordingly marked by (12.03 1.6.) 0.69 and 10:33 respectivoly. Now look out in tablo VII in the column h, 9:33 or tho next higher cipher ap to 10-33, and see whethor the corre apoading value of 2 lies botween 11.69 and 0.69. This is the case only in the year 28. The Longitude of Jupiter at the beginning of 4323 is 11.27, ftor an inorease of 0-42 it will have the required minimum valno 11.69. Table VIII shows that 0.42 is the increase of 5 comploto months. Acoordingly the given constollation oocarrod bot wo'en K. Y, 4323 VI (mean solar Alvina) and K. Y., 4324 VI. These limits hold good for the mean places only; for the truo plastu they may shift somewhat in either direotion. 
If we calonlato in the same way the preceding and following Centaries wo find that the same constellation did not ooour in 4000-4824, but it doonrred in 4440 near the end of that year, and in 4558 in Mirgasira ; (however both onbos may prove wrong when true places are oslonlated; for the time of the constellation in the first one is bat 3 months, and in the second about one month). IQ 46th oontury the same constellation occurred twice 4619 XII - 4620 V and 4679 IV - VII.EPIGRAPHIA INDICA,

Tenkodittittai (i.e. the southern Kuţittiţtai) of the Devaram is probably identical with it. It is intoresting to note that TiruvišalürAnothor village near Véppatlir also formed part of the same town. In the rocords of Parantaka 1.", Aditya II.', and of an unidentified Parakösarivarmant found at Tiruvićalir, Vömharfür is callod Amadinārāyana. chaturvodimangalam. While the inscriptions of Rājarāja I., dated in the 10th and 28th years, retaiu this other name of the town, one7 belonging to his 29th year gives Solamārtānda. chaturvodimangalam instead. The latter name is used in the records of Parakõsarivarman Rájöndra-Chola also.8 During the reign of Kulottunga III., Võmbarrar boro the name Edirilisola-chaturvödimangalam. The division in wbich the town was situated is givon in the records of Rājaraja I. and Rājēpdra-Chola I. as Dlappi-nādu a district of Rājõudrašinga-yalanadu. 10 In later times the name of the district was changed into Virudarājabhayankara-valanddull, 
The inscription is in tolerably good preservation and contains six lines of Tamil proso. The characters in which it is engraved, do not appear to belong to the 10th century A.D. to wbich it bas to be assigned. A comparisnn of tho script of this record with that of some suro inscriptions of tho samo period shows that there is a markod difference betwoon the two. The Bubjoined inscription therefore appears to have been incised at a later poriod from copies kopt of it, thoark there is no direct statemont to this effeot in the record. Tant such a practice was in vogte the time, may be gathered from No. 302 of 1908, which bolongs to the same king, but which was certainly ongravod some time after his death, as is clear from tho oso of the opithet Pon(maligai=tlufjinu-devar) (i.e. the king who died at the goldon palace), for him.

The inscription is dated in the 7th year of the reign of Sundara-Chola "who drove the Pandya (king) into the forest." It registers a grant made by his general Pirāntakan.

The donor is said to hayo purchased for 156 kalnñju of gold a picce of land measuring half (a vēli) and made it rent free before giving it to the temple.

Thoy register gifts of land by Siriyavēļār, who gots here the addi tional name Pirāntakan Irungolar. About the third records Rai Bahadur Venkayya remarks : " This rocord is partly in Sanskrit and partly in Tamil, but is, unfortunately built in. The namo Sundarn-Chola and tho fifth year occur in the Sanskrit portion, while in tho Tamil portion tho name of the king is partially accessible.

Tho fourth record which montions Pirántakan Siriyavöļār comes from Tirukkaļittattai and belongs to the time of Sundara-Chola but its dato is lost. The full namo of the donor, as gathered from all these records, is Pirantakan Siriyavēļārl alias Trungolar. It is not unlikely that this individual is identical with the general of Sundara-Chola mentionel in the subjoined inscription with the other name Tirukkafrali-Piohohan. No. 317 of the Epigraphical collection for 1908 states that he was a native of Kodambīļür.?

It is worthy of note that the family to which Siriyarelár belonged, diz. Trungörölär, of which Irungolar in Apparently a contraction, is an ancient one. Tamil literature gives a number of chiefs who were members of the Vilir family. They appear to bare settled in sevoral places. The wife of Uruvappahror llafjötchenni, the father of the famous Karikala-Chöļa was the daughter of Ulundir-Vaļ. Karikāla himself is said to have married Nädgür Võ]'s daughter.

The account gireu of Irungovēnmän, ono of the 40 Vöfir who lived soon after Vēl-P&ri, is interesting. He is said to have been the lord of Tuvaräpati (identified by Mahimahopadhyaya Swaminathlor with Drárasimulram) and to have sprung from the homa-kunda of a sage. At tho instance of an ascetic, this Iruögüviņman killed a tiger that came to interrupt his sustoritics (Puram 201 and 202). Adigaimán Nedomda Añji, whosc capital was 'Tagadür (Dharmapuri in the Sulem district), is said to have conquered the Chēra, Chóla, Påndya, Tidiyan, Ernmaiyuran and Irungovēnman. It is ovidont from this that the country over which Irvágávēl ruled, forined one of the provinces of Southern India in ancient times. The Kodumbbfür inscription of Vikramakõsari, also called 'Tennaran Iļasgüvől, declarcs that ho belongod to the Yadava race. It is worthy of poto that the Hoysalies bolonged to the same ruco, and that the acoount given of their first ancestor Sala coincider with what is rocorsled in Tamil works abont Irvágörögmān. If Tuvaripati is identical with Dváracamudnn, the date of the origin of the town is taken back a few more centuries than the time generally ascribed to it, and it Sala be identicnl with Irnogóvol, tho carlior members of the Hoysäla family have to be looked for among the Välir. At any rate, the lloysalas could not have ripen np all of a sudden in the 10th or 11th century A.D.

TIRUKKALITTATTAI INSCRIPTION OF SUNDARA-CHOLA. 
123 
Sundara Chola mentioned in the subjoined record was a Parakësarivarman or & Rājakdaari. Varman. For doing this it is necondary for us to trace out his predecessors and detorinino the titles borne by them. As regards the principle, which rogulated the adoption of the titles Rojakogari and Parakesari by the successive Chola kings, the Leyden graut informs us that these were applied alternately to the kinge in the (Chola) family. This suggests that Chola priocea, who did not actually reiga, had no claims to either of the titles. 
The way in which kājāditya, Gandarāditya and Ariñjnga, the three sons of Purantaka I., and the events connected with them and their succossors are montioned in the Chola copper-plates, makes ond believe that they succorded oach other. This view soems to have gained strength by the supposition that Parāntaka's reign lasted for 40 years, from about A.D. 907 to A.D. 947, and tbat Rajaditya was orowood in A.D. 948 and was killed in about A.D. 99, 1.8. soon after Parantaka's death. But the facts appear to be otherwise. The latest known date of Parāntaka I. is not his 40th year as has been generally Addamed, bat tho 46th which corresponds to A.D. 953, and Rajdditya's encounter with the Rashtrakata king Krishna III., in the battle of Takkolum in which he was killed by Bataga, must haro happened abont A.D. 917-8. Krishna IIl.'s actual entry into Topdai-mapdalam, however, inuy bavo ocourrod earlier, in or before A.D), 9.45. Tho large number of inscriptions of Krishna III., (called in Tainil Kannaradova) found in the North Arcot, Chingleput, South Arcot, Cuddapah and Bollorg districts of the Madras Presidency, range in date from the 5th year of his reign to the 30th, and tho king's conquest of Kachchi and Tañjai is mentioned oven in the earliest of them. The inscriptions with Saka dates of the samo sovereign range from 862 (=A.D.910)7 to 896 ( A.D, 962). But ng none of thorn gives the regaal roar, it is not possible to find out the year of his accossion. Evou nasuming that Saka 862 roprosents Krishna 111.'s first goar, we get A.D. 945 for the record of his fathe year which mentions the Chola conquest. It is thus ovident that tha Rashtrakita om o n of tho Chola country was effocted gomo tims before A.D. 945. And if Saka 862 is 
r at year, the opent must be still earlior. His now plain, that Rājāditya could not have survived his father. Gandard litya shonld. therefore, havo aucoeedod Parāntaka I. with the title of Rājikösariyarman, and he was not without issue. His only son Madburāatakan Uttama-Olola did not succeed his father, The roason for this postponement is nowhere statod but it is not far to dook. It is possible thot he was a child at the time of Gandarāditya's death becuuso his mother Sumbiyanıma iliādovi lived until at loast A.D. 1009,20 This would satisfactorily account for his exclusion from tho

throne immediately after his father kod ulso establish his claim for the Chola dominion wbioh he avontually obtained.', After Ganduraditya, his younger brother Ariñjaya was probably anointed king with the title Parakösarivarman. Naturally, therefore, his son Parántaka II. alias Supilara-Chola wonld be a Rājakosarivarınan, though on the presumption of an unbroken #accession from the time of Vijayālaya has would be a Parakösarivarman. Another point which may be argod in favour of the view that Sundara-Chola was a Rāja kosarivarman, is that Pirāntakan Siriyavolār, ono of his generals already noticed, figures in gaveral records dated in the earlier years of Rajakovarivaroan. An inscription from Tiruven kad ud of the time of 
. statos that Siriyavēļār died on a battle-field in Coylon in the 9th soar of Ponmaligaine ttrunjinadevar which was an epithet of Saudara-Chola. All the inscriptions of Rajakohari varman in which the general figures may, therefore, be assigned to Parăutaka II. alias Sundara Chola anı as may naturally be oxpected they are dated prior to the 9th year of the king's reign. The Pubults of the above discossion may be summed up thus: 
(1) Parāutaka I. diud in or after A.D. 053. (2) Rājāditya's death took place in about A.D. 947-8, and consequently he did not 
survive his father. (3) Gandrıāditya probably succeeded Parantaka I. with the title Rājakësarivarman. (4) Ariñjaga was probably the successor of Gandarāditya and a Parakõsarivarman. 
(5) Parūntaka II. alius Sandara-Cho!a was a Rājakësarivarmen. 
Sumo facts connocted with the reign of Sundara-Chola will not be withoat interest to the student of Cholu history. 
(1) One of his queens Parüntakandēvi.Ammanar was the daughter of a Chöra. Hingand lived until at least A.D. 1012.* 
(2) An earlier queen was Vānavanmabādovi wbo, to judge from her name, was also & Chcra princess. She is said to have committed suttes on the death of the king. This act on her part was considered very meritorious and princoss Kundavai (probably her daughter) Bet up an image of the queen in the Rajarajeéyara tomplo at Tanjore, presented jewols and provided for daily worship. 
(3) The king's gonoral, as pointed out already, was Pirão takan Siriyavolar, a Kodumbalar chiof. He lost his lifo in a battle field in Ceylon in the 9th year of Sundara-Ohola's reigo. The general's wife was Rūjādichohi, his daughter Kanjiramalli and his son Volán Sundarasolaga,

i Against this vicw it might be urged that there was a certain Madhurintakan Gaņdarádittanår who igares in some of tho early records of Rājarīja I. and who might be considered as * probable sou of Uttam 1-Cuola (South Ind.

(4) The king fought a fanguinary battle at a place called Chöår (śêvár) causing great 
destruction to the onemy? whose name, however, is not known. (5) He claims to have driven the Pandya (king) into the forest. (6) He is stated to bave died in a goldon palace and was, on that account, known in later 
times 88 Ponmiligaizttunjipu-dövar.3 The causes that led to Siriyavaļār's death in Ceylon can be ascertained by a reference to the events mentioned in the Singhnlese chronicle Mahavamsa. The Pandyas who were defeated by Parantaka I. in several encounters,* appear to hapo rerired their activities and given tronble to Sundara-Chola, whose victory over the Pandyas earned for him the title Pandiyanai śuram= irakkina "%.e. who drove tho Pandya (king) into the forest." That Vira-Pandya must havo been the Pandya king about this puriod inay be concluded froin the title Viru-Pandiyan-talai konda assumed by Sandara-Cholu's sun Aditya II. Vikramakosari of Kodumbālir and Parthirðudra varman - @king who is yet unidentified and whose records are mostly fonnd in the North Arcot and Chingloput districts -- assumed tho sanie title. If tho cnconnters in which these were concerned are identical with that which earried for Aditya 11, the title who took the head of Vira-Pandya', we may not be far wrong iu Assaming that Aditya II. and the two other allies were engaged in a war with the Pandyas and that the victory uchievod Wag the occasion for assuring the title Vira-Pandiyan-talai-konda by tho conqnorors. That the Kodumbalir chief Vikramakesari was a foudators of the Cholas may be gathered from the fact that he figures in the inscriptions of the Chola kings.5 
The troublos with the Pāpdyns probably brought Sundara-Chola into conflict with the king of Ceylon. One of his inscriptions at Tirıkkalittattai, which from the existing traces appears to have containod a cloar reforence to his campaign against Ceylon, is unfortunately damaged after the two syllables Ilu but the details about this war, in which the partie wore tho Singhalese and the Cholas, are preserved in the Muhīvaisa. “ Udaya III, (A.D. 964-972) becano drunkard and a slaggard, and when tho Chola king heard of his indolence, his hoart was well pleased, and as he desirod to take to himself the dominion of the whole Pāņdu country, he sent omissaries to him to obtain the crown and the rost of the apparel that the king of Panda left there when he fled. But the king rofused to yield them. W boreupon the Chola king, who was very powerful, raised an array And sont it to take thom even by violonca. Now at this time the chief of the army was absont, having gone to subdue the provinces on the border that had revolted. And tho king commandod him to return and sent him to make war. Accordingly the chief of the army went forth and fought against the enemy and perished in the battle. And the king of Choļa took the crown and tho other things." This is nindonbtedly a reference to Sundara-Chola's invasion of Coylon wherein his generol Siriyavolar is said to have died. Tho dato assigned to Udaya in the Mahāvansa also falls within the

Tho materials for fixing the exact time of Sundara-Ohola's rule, are very limited. If his records were at least numorous, wo would be in a position to ascertain the longth of his reign which is a very essential element in this direction. In the absence of this wo can only work out a tentativo dato from the available facts. Sundara-Chola's invasion of Ceylon, if the Mahāva insa could be relied upon, appears to have happened immediately aftor Udaya's uoces sion. As the latter event is placed in A.D. 964, and as we have already soon that this was in the 9th year of Sundara-Chola's reign, the date of the Chola king's accession to the throne would be about A.D. 955. 
[If Parintaka died in A. D. 953 and Gapparāditya and Ariñjaya ruled after him it appears very unlikely that Sundara-Chola Parantaka II., the son of tho latter, could have succeeded to the throno in A. D. 055, 1.0., two years aftor the death of Parantaka I. But the dates of the Mahavamsa on which Mr. Subrahmanya Aigar rolios have evidently to be corrected ; and this has been done most conclusivoly by Professor Haltzsch in his contributions to Singhalese Ohron ology (J.

The study of “ Pyu "epigraphy begios with the Fourth Text of tho Myazodi inscription of Pagan, which was disoussed in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for April 1911. from a comparison of that text with the corresponding ladi, Burmese and Tulaing vorsions, the greator part of the" Pyu" alphabet was ascertained and a number of " Pyu " words were identi fied, some with certainty, others with moro or less probability. From theso data and from the syntax of the language, so far as it was exomplified in that one text, the inforonco was drawn that the language was a Tibeto-Burman ono that had been in contact with Talaing. It was therefore provisionally assumed to havo been the vernacular of the Prome distriot in ancient times, and tho name "Pyu" was attached to it as a conveniont labol. 
Subsequent discoveries have tendod to confirm theso inferences. A number of other records in the same language have been found at Prome or its immediato noighbourhood. The " Pyu " inscriptions of which copies have beon forwarded to me comprise the following: 
(1) the Babe Pagoda insoription ; (2) the Kyaukka Thein inscription ; (3) three or four short insoriptions on votive tablets and the like ; (4) the inscriptions on arns found near the Payagyi Pagoda ; (all the above were found 
at or near Prome); (5) the Amarapura inscription (rəmoved to that place by a Burmese king); and 
6) an inscription found (I believe) at Pagan, of which only & photograph has been 
sent to mo. I am informed that tho rovorso of the stono bears anothor inscrip tion in Chinese characters, apparently unconnected with the "Pyu" one. 
Nos. 1, 2 and 6 are so dilapidated that at prosent practically nothing can bo done with thom. The records included andor No. 3 are more legible but thoy aro. very gorappy, while No. 5 contains a fragmentary text which ap to now hns yielded no now information that I can understand. No. 4 seems to offer the best oponing for study. It comprises the inscrip tions engraved on five urus, four largo stone onos and a smaller one made of earthenware. Some of these urns were found to contain ashes and were probably used for the purpose of burying the cremated bodies of individuals of some looal importance. 
On these five arns there appear to be so von distinct ioscriptions. Indicating the stone arns by the letters A to D and the earthenware one by the lotter E, the corresponding insorip tions can be conveniontly referred to as A, B1, B2, C, D1, D2 and E. B2, which follows immediately on B1, is in faint letters many of which are hardly legible ; it appears to contain 18 (or 19) akshares and to have little in common with the other records. E has only 11 aksharat and has also little in common with the roat. D2 is a long record of (apparently) 17 linas, vis. 8 lines of " Pya" text, a final line of what appear to bo merely ornamental flourishes and 8 interlinear rows of faint symbols differing from tho " Pya" lettors. In this last peouli arity it resemblea Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and at present I cannot explain what thos0 symbole stand

for. They are clearly not essential, for they do not oocar in the shorter inscriptions?. Perhaps thog are morely ornamental. D2 bas little in common with the other inscriptions and it is engraved on the botto:n of its arn. The other urn inscriptions are engraved horizontally round tho several uros. 
The four inscriptions A, B1, O and.Di, are all of one type and I propose to make a detailed comparison of them hore. Their resemblances and differenges will probably turn out to be matters of importance. For, be it remembered, " Pya " is a language of which as yet only a very small number of words have been identified, and when one is invited to decipher and interpret ineoriptions in it which, anlike the 11 yazedi one, are not accompanied by trans lations in other langarges, one finds oneself face to face with the difficulty of not knowing how to begin or where to senk for clues. It seems to me that our best chance of interpreting these records is to ascertain what is essential or common form," in them so n. to be able to distinguish it from what is acoidental or individual. Every new record of this class that may turn up in the future will help us to draw this important distinction. Then, when we are tolerably certain of the goneral intent and parport of the essential words, a comparison with the known Tibeto-Burman langanges ought to give us olues to their exact meanings But we ought first to be fairly clear as to the sort of meanings that we should look for. 
This ia parlionlarly necessary in the caBO of quasi-monosyllabio languages, where there are always a number of words that have several distiuct meanings in different contexts, an inherent ambiguity wbich is only imperfootly met by differentiation of tone. “Pyu " appears to fall into this class. It is not striotly monosyllabio, but largely so, and it apparontly rejecte final consonants altogether, thus immensely reducing the possible number of its syllabio combinations. I am still of opinion that the dots or little circles renombling anusvara, visarga, and their combinations, used in the " Pou " script, represent tonal marks. If that is correct, tho" Pya " tones must have numberod half a dozen or more. In any case it is necessary to reproduce those diacritical marks in our transoription, or we should be mixing ap quite a oamber of distinct worda. 
There are other difficalties in connexion with these inscriptions. They are, it is true, engraved for the most part in cloar and fairly well preserved characters of the same arobaic, South Indian type as the “ Pya " text of the Myazedi insoription, and most of the lettors are easily recognizable. But somo of them are only doubtfully identified as yet. There appear to be several that resemble one another ratber closely and are difficult to dis tingaish, particalarly those which in the Myszedi inscription I have provisionally reed as d, d, and I (and there may possibly be a ¢ aad l amongst them also). Further the compound aksharax are not always easy to decipher, the subaoript forms of the letters being different from the isolated forms and by no nieans easy to identity. Also there is a strong reson blanco, amounting almost to identity, between the lower portions of the letters k, gue and subscript ū. Accordingly the transcripts which I now propose to give must be regarded as tentative and subjoot to such further correotion as subsequent enquiry may ahow to be necessary. To emphasise this point I put into parentheses such letters as I consider doubtful for want of certainty of identification. Square braokets, on the other hand, will serve to indicato places where the reading is conjeotnral because the stone has suffered damage. In order to show clearly the points of resemblance and difference amongst the I place the corresponding words directly in the same vertical lines. The actual text of each of these four inscriptions (and also of B2), begins with the three paragraph marts which apprar at the beginning of the Myazodi insoription. '

The word bho might conceivably berg, rg or ng; to may be ug or even re, and so on. There is very little to guide one in these doubtful cases, when the language is as good as unknown. I am not sure whetbertso jaat before the last tda8 onght to have two dots after it or one : the texts appear to differ. In O pinia looks like mira. The letter mi is also very like j in several of these words. 
It appears from these inscriptions compared together that they have the following common alomonts : (a) the phrase tdg8 &8#....0d8, whioh inoludes the easily recognizable propor names Harivikrama, Sihavikrama and Suriyavikrama, (b) the phra86 beginning with snis and eading with ta kro kha u ans, and (c) the final phrase bd8 u tu kjo8 yd. What are we to nake of it allP It appears from the Myazedi inscription that td 8 moans "king" and bd8 is a general honorifo word, prefixed to the names of august personages (and worshipful objects, such as the atutae of the Buddha mentioned in that insoription). What the next few words stand for I do not know. In the Myazodi insoription hi appears to mean " to die " and " death", but I am by Do means sure that it is the same word here. In view of the unintelligible variant in Bl and the additional tra hna ka in 4, I have my doubts. Perhaps these are partly names or titles of the personagem commomorated. It is plain that on the strength of the first phrase we are justified in sponking of a dynasty reigning at Prome, which used « Pou" as its official language and Aitooted Indian named ending in vibrand. But very likely its mombers had “Pya" Dames an well. The honorifo bd8 was apparently capable of being sufixed as well as prefixed to the royal name. The words wog8 to put in Dl are beyond me at present. I merely point out that the first word oooars in 1. 3 of the Myasodi insoription. Possibly it should be road u vo8 and in that On.fo the w would be the genitive affix. It would then be tempting to ounjeoture that vp8 meant "qnoon", as it nocompanies the word maya8 in that context. If we read uug8, perhaps the word means " bis." But in any Oaso I think wo may conclude with groat probability that

Di commemoratos some near relations of Sariyavikrama, whether his consort be among them or not. The string of words (with honorifios) after his name, for which there is no parallel in the other records, seems to indicate that much. Besides Suriyavikrama's own aru is C, and no man requires more than one oofin. It is tompting to interpret pitons menning “grandchild", on the strength of 1. 24 of the Myazedi inscription; but this last has phi, not 
plso, which is a doubtful reading anyhow. : I pass on to the next phrase. In the Myazedi inscription oni8 means "year",' and I am 
confident that it has the same sepse in our arn-inscriptions. A priori it is reasonable to assume that it wonld be closely associated with numerals, and I note that that is the case here. In BI it is followed by hrå, which in the Myazedi inscription represented "eight". In Di it is followed by haus, which we might perhaps read ho8 and which in any case reminds one of the word hos that stood for " three" in the Myazedi record. Later on in A there is a word td, which in the Myazedi record meant "ono." The inference is that the corresponding unknown words are also numerals. Among them there is one which coustantly appears in the same relation to the other words, though theso change. The constant is sū, and esouming ** Pya" to use a decimal aystom, we must conolude that sa means "ton". For reasons that will presently appoar, it cannot bo "a hundred " nor is it likely to be "twenty." 
At this point & digression bocomes necessary. M. George Codos has publishedi & Tory kind appreciation of my paper on the “ Pya" text of the Myazadi insoription and drawn my Attention to the fact tbat the symbols in 11. 1-2 thereof which I bad read cú jha o are not * Pyn" words of number as I had supposed but the conventional symbols employed in some unciont Indian insoriptions to represent 1000, 600, and 20, respectively. I sooept these identifications the more readily as I had myself felt (and suggested in a note that my e night after all possibly be the old numeral symbol for 20. I can now confirm M. Codes view, as I have compared the original rubbings (which are much larger and also cloarer than the plate published with my paper in the Journal) with Bühler's Indische Palæographie (PI. IX) and find that the symbols, including that for 600, correspond. But with regard to hrd I am not 80 euro. M. Codes would also make of it a conventional symbol. But the symbol is hra pot hrá. And what has a tonal mark to do with & pomoral figure P. Scoondly, hrá is used in l. 7 of the Myazodi toxt in connexion with an entirely different form of 20, which I conjecturally transliteratod shu but now propose to identify with the tpa (or npa ?) of A and Bl. This I take to ho a genuine "Pyn" word for “twenty", not an Indian au morical symbol. Thirdly, hrd is apparently uaed in Bl as a multiplier of at, ton. Therofore I still think that I may have been right in taking hrá to be a “Pyu" word and a relative of the Burmese Thach, of gennine Tibeto-Burman descent. 
To return to the other namerals in our four inscriptions. There is no internal evidence as to the values of tho unidentified ones not yet mentioned. The following table is therefore to be considered as based largely on conjecture tompored by a goneral comparison with the forms of numerals in other Tibeto-Barman languages :

THE "PYU" INSCRIPTIONS.

The powel au 18. used in the Mya.sedi inscription as a variant of 0; but I must admit that it is odd that both, 8t and sau (which is, moreover, a doubtful reading) should appear in guch short dooumont aus O. Also the word tru is not quite certain, that portion of the rubbing being by no means olear; it might conceivably be tra, though I prefer the reading #ru. I assume that "Ave" has two forms, the shorter one being used as a multiplier. If these more hypothetioal conolasions were correct, these insoniptions have by a fortunate concurrence of circumstances given us a series of "Pya" numorala which is complete 80 far as it goes and sooms to be in general agreement with the numorils of other Tibeto-Burnian languages. But further confirmation will of coarse be 28008sary before we can'acoept it as definitely established in every partioular. 
As ons8 moans " year " it seems rodbopable to suppose that do (or le, or whatover the truo reading may be) and phul stand for other divisions of time, probably "month" and "day" respectively: tor thoy also are followed by numerals, or words which we have found to form part of the numerical combinations used in connexion with snis, or words used alternatively to such words. I take tio to bo & postposition meaning "in ", but I admit that there is some doubt as to this, and its use hero sooms rathor capricious and irregular. "The phrase ta kto kha u oni8 common to all four toxts is evidently, a formula describing the type of yoar intonded. As it is a constant it can only refer to some oharsotoristio or quality common to all tho years previously mentioned, and tho most natural view of it would soom to be that it defines thom by reference to some fired point, in other words it denotes sone era. Then follows another chronological phrase beginning with snis. This is wanting in Dl and I take it to refer to the ages of the deceased persons commemorated in theso epitapha. If arn D contained the mingled ashes of several members of the family, that might be a good reason why this phraso in not found in Di. At any rate these numorals have no constant relation to the preceding sets of numerals, and they are too high to be probable lengths of reigns. 
Lot us now tabulato those chronological data. Assuming the first set of numbors to be referable to some fixed point or era, the inscriptions will fall into the ordor D1, C, A, B1. There is of course nothing in the texts (so far as we can understand them at present) to determine what fixed point or ora is implied. But let us assume, for the sake of convenionce, that it was the ordinary Burmese era of 638 A.D. We can then make out the following chronological table : 
(i) year 35 (673 A.D.); Säriyavikrama's relative or relatives died; (2) year 50 (688 A.D.), 5th month; Sūriyavikrama himself diod, aged 64 years; (3) year 57 (695 A.D.), 2nd month, 24th day; Harivikrama died, aged 41 years, 7 months 
and 9 days (4) year 80 (718 A.D.), 2nd month, 4th day; Sihavikrama died, aged 44 years, 9 months 
and 20 days. From this it is obvious that the three porsonages named could very well have boon grand father, father and son occupying the throno of the Prome monarchy in lineal succession. Of course we aro not entitled to assert that this really was the fact : but as a working hypothosis it seems to be consistent with the evidence at present available. 
So too as to the era, the most one can say is that it is not an impossible ono. But there is very little to guide us as to tho age of those inscriptions. We know that the Myazedi rocord is only about 800 years old, yet its alphabot does not differ yory inatorially from that of our urn-insoriptions. But then it shows signs of great arobaism, the loading instance being the anchor-shaped subscript y, which was obsolete in India after tho 4th oe such a conservative attitude on the part of “Pyu" scribes that I cannot undorstand how anyone can profess to date their insariptions by paleographical evidenco alono, Wo koon from bistory that the Burmese of Pagan conquored the South somewhere in the 11th century and therefore one is naturally disposed to date the Vikrana dynasty of Prome before that

period (aplen they were merely local chiefs, vassals of Pagan). Besides, the alphabet of the amoingariptions does ibok alightly oldor than that of the Myazedi racord. On the other hand M. Pinot has pointed ont' that the form of the letter with the lower hook joined to the main Thatt indioster & dato not onrlier than the 6th century. This leaves & margin of abont 300 years wherein to looatu the Vikrama dynasty, and vagne as it is I regnet to any that at procent I can suggest no more definite solution of this chronological problom. It is of dorinte a porfootly reasonable inference from the archaic type of the alphabet that the introdaction of Hinda oivilisation iato the Prome district de verenl cantarios further back than the probablo period (7th or 8th century P) of those pra-inscriptions. 
There remain for consideration the concluding words of our texts. It will be notiond: that there is complete agrooment among them as to the last five syllables. Plainly the phrene has something to do with the common parpose of all these epitaphs. As the word yd appears from the Myaxdi insoription to be a demonstrative meaning "this," I oonjootare that the pbrace is descriptive of the urna or their content. The essential words are of ourne klos (or uru kjú8) or whatever else the right reading may be. These are qualified by the honorifo 
). For it is not quite certain, first, whether tdg8 (which does not appear in Di) good with what prooedes or with bd8, secondly, whethor u is the genitive partiole or the first syllable of a word uru.s Bither way I imagine the phrase to mean something like “ these are vedorable (or royal, or worshiptal) romains (or corporeal relios)", or " this is a royal faneral urn", or something of that kind. Here there is soope both for conjecture and for comparison. I have, I fear, already indulged in more than enough of the formor'and my want of soquaintanop with the Tibeto-Barman langaages disqualifies me from adequately using the latter mothod. But it has struok me that ru or uru is curiously like the Burmese 30 9: "bode ", a word which I understand is applicable to the ashor of orematod persons. And if we could find out what 
the phrase oould be determined. Unfortanately the ohamoteristic pacaliarity of "Pya" already referred to makes comparison very difficult. The language apparently tolerates no final consonant and therefore the word kjøl might conceivably corrowpond to almost any Barmena monosyllable beginning with ky or kr, and there are many snob. Until the older forms of Burmese have been studied and it has been ascertained in what cases ky (or kr) goos back to a primitive kl, as it doos in somo word, or until aarbor of othør Tibeto-Barman languages have been drawn into the comparison, any suggostod explanation most romain highly conjostaral. It is also, of course, by no means probable that Barmoge will give osotal olues for every “ Pyo" word; it may often bo Deostory to look for them in other members of the family. 
Horo I must leave the subject, at any rate for the probent. It will be obvious to evory body that there is a very great spoonlative element in the suggestions I have vontured to put forward. My object in throwing them ont is to stimulate enquiry among those who are more competent to parsne this line of research than I can over hopo to be. I trust that I have put my hypotheses in such a form that they can be chooked by Tibeto-Burman scholar and I leave to them the task of confirming or retating them, as the case may be, woording to the balance of the evidence that may be brought to bear on these questions. But I venture to think that some of the results of my examination of those urn-insoriptione will stand the tout of future research and that it will be found that these texts copaist, broadly spoaking, of phrwas Qonvoying pretty much the personal, ohronological and other information, which my tentative analysis olaims to have detected in them.

No. 17.-RAMATIRTHAM PLATES OF INDBAVARMAN. 
BY PROFESOR E. HULTzson, Pi.D.; HALLI (Sula). 
Those plates belong to a family of Pandits at Ramatirtham near Vixianagram. I odit the insoription on them from excellent ink-impreasiong mobived from Roo Sahib H. Krishna Sastri, who describes there as follows: 
Those are three oopper-plated measuring 8}" in length and about 2* in breadth. The first and third boar writing only on their inner side. The plates are strong on an oral oopper ring measuring 3" by 8th, which had aot yot been out when they were received in this ofioa. Ite ende are secured in & Mass of copper, at the top of which is impressed an oval soal measur. ing 11 by lf" in diameter. The seal shows the faint figure of an advancing lion or tiger (facing the proper right), with its loft foro-paw raised, neok erect, month wide-open, and the tall raised above the back, so as to and in a loop. The platos with ring and soal weigb 75 tolas." 
The writing is well preserved throughout. The alphabet rosembles that of the Chikkalla plates of Vikramôndravarman II. (above, Vol. IV, No. 25); but, while in those t is distin. guished from n by a loop, neither of thora shows a loop here. The d of adaka (1. 7) does not dittor in shape from the dental d. The Dravidian lottor ( is employed in Plaki (1. 6). A final form of tooonn ia 1. 1, 13, 15, 17, and one of m in ll. 10 and 14. 
The languago is Sanglait prose (with four versos of Vytsa and Hapu quoted in 11. 12-15). The Sandhi rules are not always observed, and the sh of varsha (1. 16) is doubled in oontraven tion of Panini, VIII, 4, 49. Ia karttavyanm-ejia (1. 10), inal m is doabled botweon vowols. The wording of 11. 3.4 is incorroot, as the notes on the text will show. This is evidently due to the frot that the olerk who drafted the panegyrical portion copied or adapted an old ofios-record in a very oareless manner, 
The inscription tooords that the king (rajan) Indravarman (1. 6) granted to a Brāhmana the village of Poravsdaka (1. 6 f.) or Peruviţaka (1. 7) in the Plad-rashtra (1.6). The game district is mentioned a Plaki-viahaya and Palaki-vishaya in two inscriptions of the Eastern Chalnkya king Vishnuvardhana I. 
Indravarman was the son of the king (rajan) Vikrambadra (1. 5) and the grandson of the Kahardja Midhatavarman (1. 2) of the family of the Vishnukundin kingo (I. 3). This short podigreo establiahes his identity with the Maharaja Indrabhattarakavarman whose son, the Maharaja Vikramondravarman II., issued the Chikkulla plates, and who was the son of Vikramdndrararman I. and the grandson of the Maharaja Madhavavarman of the Vishnakup. din family. As regards this family, Professor Kielhorn has suggested that its name may be connooted with Viankonda in the Kistna district. 
While the Chikkalla plates were issued from Lendaļūra (i.e. Dendularna naar Ellore), Indravarman issued the subjoined grant from a place named Puraninangams (1.1). In both granto Midhayavarman and Vikramöndra varman II., respootively, is stated to have been :

faring No. 18.- RAMPAL COPPER-PLATE GRANT OF SRICHANDRADEVA. 
BY RADHAGOVINDA BABAK, M.A.; RAJBHAHI. Last summer I made a tour, at the instance of the Varandra Rosenrob Sooiety. Raisbahi. in some of the villages of Vikrampur in the Dacoa Distriot of the Bengal Presidency, and visited sites of arohæological interost inolading Råmpål, wbich is believed to contain the ruins of the eastern capital of the Sena kings of Bengal. I was informed by Baba Jogindrachandra' Chatterjeo and his younger brother Baba Homondrachandra Chatterjee of Panahnsdr that one Yadundth Vanikya of their village had an inscribed copper-plate in his possession. I then wong to the said Vanikya on the 29th April, 1913, and purchased the plate from him on behalf of the Varondra Roscaroh Society. This plate, according to Yadunath, was discovered about 78 years ago by a Muhammadan onltivator in digging his land somewhere in Båmpal (whioh is only a mile-and-a-half from Pañobasar). The plate was made over to Yadao&th', father, since then it has been preserved 88 & sacred objeot in the Vanikya family. The plate Le now dopositod in the Museum of the Varðndra Research Society at Rajahäbi. I odit tha inscription from the original,

went 
tie 
. The plate measuros 94" x 8". At the top of it, in the middle, in attached a goal, which 
· has, in its upper part, the emblem of the Buddhist " Whool of Law", the Dharmma-[cha*]kra 
(1. 31) with two deers in couchant posturo on both silos of it. Just below the wheel and above the legend fri-Srichandra[de]rah, something liko tho emblem of a small conch-shell is soen. Benonth the legend again, tho i'cprcsentation of a digit of the moon, with floral decorations on the three other sides of it, may be marked. This crescont, it seems, indicates the moon from whom the donor and his ancestors are said to have descended. All these symbola and decorntions togother with the logend are in rolief. Tho most notablo feature of this seal is that it resembles to a great extent the heall of the coppor-plate grants of the Pala kings of Bengal, who wore also Buddhists in religion. 
The plate is in an excollent state of preservation and has not safforod much from corrosion as its edges were raised into rims; but the depth of the letters has boon impaired by nitric acid which tho owuor of it confessed to huvo applied in order to clean it; and as tho rosult of this, some of tho letters look blurrell, especially on the loverso sido. The plate is inscribed on both sides, the obverse containing 28 lines of writing and the ruperbe 12 lines only. . The characters of the inscription belong to a variety of nlphabots a god in the eastern part of Northern India in the eleventh and twolfth centurios. The letters aro engraved with considerable skill, and they look well-shaped, and aro cut cloarly and dooply. The size of the letters throughout is nearly inch. Some spelling mistakes orcur, doo, likely, to tho ignoranco or oversight of the scribo or the engraver. The errors of omission have boon pointed ont in tho foot-notes of the toxt. 
As regard: orthography, the letter ba is thronghont expressed by the sign for va; the guttaral nasal is nacd, instead of anusuririt, bufore tho palatal wibilaut, in = varsa, l. 3, and #amritakariinsuh, I, 6; m has often bron retained beforo va, instoad of boing changed to anustára, e.g.,-friyin=vikhyāli, 1.1, shasthim-varsha.,1. 35, and paradutlam-ri, 1, 36. It may also bo noted that almost all consonants aro doubled after r, uscept ya, su, and ha; of. nivelitārir-yasah., 1.14; -puryanti, 1. 21; durss, 1, 7, and yithrirhan, 1. 22. The consonant va in such position is sometimes soon doubled and s motimcg loft single ; cf. -sorvvadhikṣitu, 1. 19, -sartri-pida, 1. 25, zuduka-purrakun, 1. 28, sarvitira, 1. 31 f., and tahubhir va[ 8u*]dha, 1. 37. The sign of avagraha is employod in throo plaous, in Pürnnachandra bhavat, l. 4, -Jivino 'dhyaksha., 1. 21, and produtta 'smäbhih, 1. 31 ; but it is omittod elsewhore ; thus, dharmmõ=py-asau, 1. 1, and dursēxsya, 1. 7. 
The language is correct Sanskrit thronghont. The inscription, after tho words Om svasti with which it commencos, has 8 verses, followed by prose, at tho ead of which again we find fire of the usual improcatory and benoilietiro verses. At tho end of the document we find a sign of interpunction, consisting of a circle, of the sizo of the lotters, betweon double bars. 
The plate is not dated, nor dors it mention the engravor's or the seribo's name. Thore is DO separate ondorsement of the king or any of his chief olicors at the close of the deed, as we find in some of the Bengal plates. 
The object of the inscription is to record tho grant of rent-free Innd, in the village of Nöbakashthi of the Nãnya-mandula in the prosperous Paupara-bhukti, (1. 17), made by the devout Saugata (worsbipper of Sugata, Buddha) Paramiscara Paramabhattaraka Maharajadhiraj, the glorious Srichandradāva, who meditates on the scet of the Maharaja. dhiraja Trailökyachandradēva (II. 15-16), to a Brāhmapa, named Pitavāsaguptaśarman, the son of Sumangalagupta, the grandson of Varihagupta, and the great-grandson of Makkara. 
I see for instance, the seat of the Kbālio pur plate of Dharmapaladõva, printed opposite to p. 244, Ep. Ind. Vol. IV.

gupta (11. 27-28), for the increase of merit and fame of his parents and of himself. The gotra and pravara only of tbe doneo aro mentioned, but not the vēdas and dakha he studied. The charter is isued from the royal camp at Vikramapura. The phraseology of the grant in tho probe portion mostly resembles that of the othor Bengal plates, those of the Palae, the Varmans, and the Sodas. 
Tho historical information that can be gathered from this plate, may be thus summarised. To tho opening vorge, the Buddhist Triratna, viz., tho Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, aro miontionod with veneration by the court-poet, indicating thereby that his master must have boon a Buddhist, which fact can also be inferred from l. 15. In tho family of the Chandras, there aroso ono Porppachandra whose name, wo are told (v.2), appeared on pedestals 
ictory, and on plates of coppor. But he is not desoribed as a king. Elis son was the Bauddha Suvarnachandra (v.3), whose mother, it is stated (v.4), was beguiled by her husband with a golden moon, when sho, whilo enceinte, oxpressed, on A new-moon ovoning, her longing to see tho disc of the rising inoon. His son was Trailokyachandra, who, “The support of the royal majesty smiling in the royal umbrella of the king of Harikala (i.e., Eastern Bongal)"_became king(nripati) of Chandravipa (v.5.). It cannot be definitely kaowa what political rolation, if any, this king of Chandradvipa had with the king of Harikola. Srichandra, tho son of Trailokyachandra, was born of his wifo Srikábohani (v. 6). The astrologers announced, from the marks the new-born babe boro on his porxon, that he was dostined to rolo a kingdom (v. 7.). Ho brought tho whole country ander his rulo by tbrowing his enomy (or onomies ?) into prison (v. 8). It is not easy, at the prosent moment, to Buy who are rcfurred to by the word “enemy" in the verge, and which dynasty then ruling at Vikramapura was overthrown by tho Buddhist king Srichandra, 
All that we knew hitherto of any Chandra king ruling in Fast Bengal is the referonce to & king of tho name of Govindachandral, who had to mako good his escape, after having desconded from his clopbant, when the Chola king Rūjéadra-Choladeva I. invaded the Vadgáladosa.

No. 19.-NILGUNDA PLATES OF VIKRAMADITYA VI; A.D. 1087 and 1123. 
BY LIONEL D. BARNETT. 
This inscription is here edited for tho first tinio, from ink-impressions sent by Mr. H. Krishna Sastri to Dr. Flcot, and placod hy tho latter at my disposal. From Mr. Krishna Sastri's dunval Roport on Epigraphy for the year ending 31st March 1913, p. 8, para. 11, and p. 13, No. 8, it appears that the original plates wero secured by Mr. Rangarajayya, ag. Kaparose Epigraphical Studout, and wero transmitted by tho Tahsildir of Harpanbaļļi; the circumstances in which they were found aro not stated. 
Nilgunda is a villago of some sizo in tho Harpaohnlli täluka, Bellary District, Madrna Presidency. It is shown as "Neelgoonda" iu tho Indinn Atlas, sheet No. 59 (1828), and as "Nilagunda" in the quarter-sleet No. 59, N. W. (1901), in lat. 14° 44', long. 75° 57', soven miles south-west-by-wost from Harpanhalli. The place is believed to have been & flourishing town some conturios agd; and it possesses a large tank and two old temples, sacred to Ananta dayana and Bbimnisvara rospectively; the latter sanctuary, which lies on the bund of the tank and is said to be profusely adorned with sculptures, is probably the very tomple of Bhiměsvara to which our inscription alludes on line 74. The village is called in linea 64 and 77 of our 
Tho adjective sa-larani as applied to the granted piece of land occurs in the Beláva plate of Bböjavarmndūvu (abaro pr. 41, 1. 8V) indicating perlaps tlist tho land was in & ba-borderiog place. 
Cf. sant yngāridhikrila, abure p. 41, 1. 13. 
Seo Sewell's Lists of Romains, Vol. I (1882), p. 109, from which it appears that the tomple of Anantalayana contains ono “illegible" inscription and that of Bhimokvare six : sco nlno the Madras Manual of Administration, Vol. III (1693), p. 319. Mr. Sewell gives the onmo 28 Nilagunda, with cerebral nd. The Madras Manual seems to be of the same opinion; it states that the Sauakrit name of the village is Nilarati-pattana, "town of Nilavati", and proposes to derivo Nilgunda from nila (A5 - milávali) and gunta (P gunto), which lattor word, it sayo, in Kanaruso, and means touk. Lines 6+ and 77 of the presont docoment effectually dispose of this attempt at et yinology : tho dental d, though not very clear in the facsimile, is quite certain in both places in the ink. impressions.

The plates are three in number. The first and third are inscribod on tho innor side only, the second on both sidos. Thoy moasure about l' 4" from end to end, and 10!" in height. bnt are not very uniform in size : plato I measuros about 16" by Il' at tho left ond and 104" at tho right, plato 2 is practically 16" by 101", and plato 3 monsures uourly 16t" by 107". Mr. Krishna Sastri states that thoy were strong on a circular copper ring, about " thick and 41" in diameter. the onds of which are fixed into a heavy quadrangular sonl, also of coppor, which measures 
bont 31" by 3"; tho ripg had not boon ont when tho platos reachod bim. In the centre of the rather deeply sunk surfaoo of this soal is tho figure of a boar (tho crest of the Chalukyag). runding, facing to the propor right; above tho boar, in two rowa, nppoar tha 81711, a chauri () the crescont moon, a svastika, and a drum ; bohind the boar is a symbol which may be a flag.staff or lamp-stand; below the boar is a legend in Old- Kanareso charactors, frimuch-Chalukyu [Bhalvalla[bha]. The weight of the platos, ring, and seal is stuted to be 765 tolas. 
The characters of the document are Nägarī, similar on the whole to thoso figured in plate V ("Nördliche Alphabeto von ca. 800-1200 P. Chr.''), vole. 21-23, of Bühler's Indische Palaeographie. They are well and carefully cut, with an averago hoight of about to g". The concluding phrase fri-Saradnyai namah, however, is written in lotters of the Sáradā type, 
in hoight, a feature which is probably duo to tho fact that the scribe, Mollaya, was a Kashmiri. The language is throughout Sanskrit, with the oxcoption of the Kanareno phrase gardarul-ganda in l. 41, and the number of clerical orrors in romarkably small. The collectivo m=ritvik in l. 15 is worth noting; of. Dolbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 36. As far as line 58 the toxt is in verse, with a few short connocting passages in proso : and thoro aro some of the standard minatory verses in lines 80-84. The orthography presents no remarkable features : nasals are ropresentod usually, but not invariably, by the anusvár ; v is usod for l all through and has been written by me without correction; final s is changed to visarga before initial sibilants; and ( never appears in place of l. 
Our inscription records a grant of the village of Nilganda and two adjacent hamlets to a number of Brühmans by tho Western Chalukya king Tribhuvanamalla. Vikramaditya VI. made in A. D. 1123 in confirmation of his provious grant of the yoar 1087. It opens with the usual Obălukyan prolude, Jayaty-tīvishkpilan, etc., and then, aftor another verso of benediction, invokes a blessing upon the reigning sovereign. Thon begins the pedigree of tho Chalukya kinga. Fifty-nine sovereigns of this family, wo aro tolil, raled formerly in Ayodhyd, and later sixteen of thom roignod in tho South. After a tomporary obscuration their fortunes were restored by Jayasimha I (1. 10), who overcame the Rashtrakūta king Indra. son of Krishna, and slow five hundred other kings. Then camo his son Raparåga (1. 13); his Bon Pulakēģin I (1. 13); his son Kirtivarman I, tho conqueror of tho Nalas, Kadambas, and Mauryse (1. 10); his younger brother Mangališa, who capturod the island of Rövati and humbled tbe Kalachuri dynasty, reigning as rogent during tho childhood of his older brothor's bon (1. 18); and then the latter, Satyasraya I (in other inscriptions styled Pulakõsin II), who conquered king Harsha, i.c. Harshavardhana of Kanouj (l. 19). We aro then informed that the noxt two monarchs wore Satyūsraya's son Nodamari (hero spolt Nidamari, with i for and tho latter's son Adityavarman (I. 21). The pedigree then enumerates Vikramåditya I. here onlled the son of Adityavarman (1. 22); Vikramaditya's son Yuddhamalla (1. 22); his son Vijayaditya, the conquoror of four provinces (1. 22); his son Vikramaditya [I, (1. 29). his son Kirttivarman II, under whom tho star of the dynasty sufferod an eclipso (1.23); brother of Vikramīditya, whose name is not given, but was possibly Bhima (1, 24); the latter's

son Kirttivarman III (1. 24); his son Taila I (1. 24); his son Vikramaditya III (1. 24); his son Bhima (II) (1, 25); his son Ayyana (I), who marriod u daughtor of the Rasbţrakūta king Krishna III (1. 25); their son Vikramiditya IV, why married Bonthādēvi, daughter of kiug Lakshmana of Chodi (1. 20); their fon Taila II, who couuered the Rüshtrakūtas Karkira and Ranastambha, rostorod the fortunud of his dynasty, and married Jākabba, daugliter vf tho Rat:& Bhammaha (l. 28); their AOU Satyäsraya II (1. 36); his younger brother Dasavarman, who mariod Bhagyavati (1. 36); thoir son Vikramaditya V, who reigned aft:r his father's elder brother (1. 37); Vikramaditya's younger brother Jayasingha II, Atyled Jagadēkamalla and Mallikāmóda (11. 39, 40); his son Ähavamalla (Sömēsvara I), 
t by this kings of the Milava and Chola lands and Kanauj (1. 43); bis son, tho renowne i Bhuvanaikamalla (Sõmēsvara II), (1. 49); and finally the latter's youngor brother, Vikramaditya VI, styled Tribhuvanamalla (1. 54), the donor of the present grant, who made successful oxpeditions and imposed his authority upon a Dravidinn king. 
Somo points in this pedigree may lie here briefly noticed ; they are discussed more fully hy Dr. Fleet in the Indian Antignary, Vol. XVI, p. 17 fi. The statomont en 11. 20-21 that SatyĀárnya 1, ic. l'ulakiisin II, was followed by 11 kon Nedamari and the latter's sun Āditya varman is not corroborated by carlier rocords, and is a puro mistake: Vikramaditya I, who is her said to ho the son of Aditynvirman, wat ronlly the son of Satyäśraya I, an Adityavarman was one of his b.others: thero win no Nedamari in the lino at all. Yuddin mulla's Dame is givoli moru correctly in the car'y inscriptions as Vinayāditya. The disaster iu the reign of Kirtivarman II, mentioned in l. 23, in which “ the fortunos of the Chalukyan empire vanished", is a roforenre to the ronquest by tho Riobţrakat Dantidurga or Dantivarman II, about A.D. 756. The powor of the dynasty was not thoroughly re-ostablished until the reign of Tivila II, A.D. 973-97. It would hence scem that the statements of the prosont pedigree rozarding tho kinys froin the first to the ancond 'Taila, covering a period of about two centuries, are defective; probably there is a gap lx:fore Taila I, Dasavarman (who is named Yasovar man in the Kauthen grant, Ind. Ant., XVI, pp. 15 ff.) docs not seem to havo ever roigned ; and Vikramāditya V, who is here said to be his son, bat in an inscription at Harihar, and porhaps also in one at Digyávia, is called a son of Satyāśraya II, may have beon really & child of Daśavarman adopted by Satyäsraya as his succose r. 
Verse 37, en line 4%, contains a play on words which is noteworthy: speaking of Jayesi taha II, it sayo:-"Mallikamoda is very illustrions in the land of Kuntala, which is famous for the 
riper) Krisbnavarņā and has a loyalty arising from affection for Taila [II];" and secondarily "A fragrance of jasmine sirungly pervades a braid of hair which has the famous (black) huo of Kțishna and a smoothness caused by sesam-oil." On this verse Dr. Fleet givus me the following remarks :--" For Mallikamnda, "fragrant an jasmine", as a kiruda or secondary name of Jayasió ha II, ACO () Pili, Sanskrit, and Old-Canurese Inscriptions, No. 150, of A.I). 1035, line 6; Epi, Ourn., vol. 7, Shiinoga, Sk. 126 ; (2) PSOCI, No. 153, of A.D. 1038, line * ; Sk, 183 ; (3) Sk. 211 a, of A.1), 1031 (not iv PSOCI); (4) PS001, No. 154, of A.D. 1019, line 4 ; Sk. 125; edited in Ind.

line 26 a god at Balagămi named Mallikámodatvara, "the lóvara (Siva).of Mallikāmoda," ovi deutly established by or in honour of, and named after, Jayasimha II. Kantala is woll known as a general name for the Western Chalukya territory abovo the Ghants. Krishpavarpå stands here for Krishnavernd ; this was a name of the river Krishnå from its confluence with the Verņa, Vönd, or Yepņā, at Sangam-Mähuli, three miles east of Satūra :1 other forms of it aro Krishyaveppi, Krishpabeppa, Krishpavēpa, and Krishnayoni;and sometimes the full namo was replaced by simply Verpå and Vöpl. The present record, being Sanskrit, uses u for the Dravidian short e in the third syllablo, and so gives the namo as Křishmavarpa; another Sang krit record, of A.D. 959, presonts the name in the Prakrit form Kanhavanni. In tho expression vikhyāta-Krishna-varnne thoro is probably also a furthor allusion to tho fortile "black soil" for which a great part of the territorios in question is so famous, the kare bhūmi, kure nela, whence through karo-nūdu, " the black country", we have the namo Karnata, Kannada." 
After the proamble the document prooeeds to business, and formulates the grant in tho following torms (1. 58 to ond).:-" The fortunate soveruiga king Tribhuvangmalla-vallabha, the darling of Fortune and the Earth, the groat emperor, sopreme lord, supreme master, ornament of the race of Satyasraya, ombellishment of the Chålukyas, boing iu good health, with greotings of good health issues a command to all whose dignity is thercin conocrnod, lords of kingdoms, lords of provinces, village-headmed, sheriffs (äyuktakas), commissioners (niyultakas), officials, presidents, and othurs :

of the villago of Talevagy, and the other stream at & spot nearly west of the village of Kamandalukārpass ; on tho South, the stream at a spot nearly uorth of the village named Tilaka ; on the South-West, the rock, and to the north thoreof, on the cast of the village named Lakshågēha, tho Buffalo's Rock (mahisha-păshana); on the West, the pool of the Madhūka. tree, and to the North-West thoreof the Ayasasära tamarind troo; on the North-West, the Dirghitunga hill; on the North, the anthill of the golden Acacia (svarmu-khadira) ; on tho North-East, the Akshara rock. Thus the extent of the bounds. 
* For tho worsbip of the local god Bhim ávara (1. 74.) with fragrant flowers, inconse, lights, oblntions, etc., for tho restoration of broken, burst, and wom-out (parts of sacred buildings] aud for the supply of fresh plaster, for the provision of dancing, singing, instrumental music', refreshments, and attondanco upon the facrod prekonco, and for the pnrpose of feeding Brāhinags and ascetics, tho hanılot of Adityapallika has been granted, together with the lands tbcroof, under oharter, with a settlement of whatover is included in the tribhoga, as being oxempt fronu tolls, taxes, and opposing clnimy, immune from all payments, not to be looked at with the finger (of confiscation] of royal officers, carrying with it truasure and trouvaille, and wholly freo, for the ontortniumont of the god. The bounds of this hamlet are onumorated (1.77): on the East, South-East, South, and South-West tho boundary is the same as that specified for the villago of Niruguoda ; on the Wost, the ombankment of the Nāgara pool ; on the North West, North, and North-East the atroam of the Mango-lake (chüta-hrada). Thus the extent of thu boumls of Ādityapallikā. [The villago) with its boundaries thus previously known to the public, clearly darked out on the four sides of socess, is to be protected by you, futuro kings, whothor of Our dynasty or others. 
"And thus suyo the Lord Võda-Vyšsa (l. 80). Sagara and many other kings have made grants of land; whosoever holds the soil at any time has the fruit thereof for that timr." The same [author] likewise speaks of the guilt involvod in removal thoroof :-*Ho wlo should tako away lnud, whether granted by himself or by others, is born as a worm in dung for sixty thousand years ; one who takes away a single gold piece, & singlo oow, or a single inch of soil, goes to hell until the dissolution of the universe ; they who lay bands upon brāhraapia fiefs are born ag black spakcs lying in withored treo-trunks amidst the waterless wildernesses of the Viudhya." Likewise Rāmabundra hayk :-" This general principle of law for kings mast be maintained by you in every age ; again and again Ramabhadra makes this entreaty to all these future sovorcigns; I clasp my hands on my head in salutation to those future monarchs on tho earth, whothor born of my own line or of linus of other kings, who with sonls free from sin preserve this diy law in its entirety." 
The record ouds (1, 85ff.) with tho specification of the writer:- This we written by me, the Kāśnīra master Mallaya Pandita, officer in charge of grants, son of Aryama-Svāmi, who Wis comparablo to Bhatta-Vilāna, of the Vatsa gotta and Săna Voda, with the approval of Vikramaditya, son of Kalidūsa, Keoper of Charters, Head of the Office of Accounts, and most august Gonoral of the Forcco. Good fortuno! Homago to tho Blessed Sarada !" 
The record contains two datos, the first being that on which the villago Nirnganda was originally granted, the second that on which the grant was repeated, with some addi tions. The details of the first date arc tho Prabhava samvatsara, being the twoNth year of the Chalukya-Vikrama-varsha, ie, of the reign of Vikramaditya VI; the thirteenth tithi of the dark fortnight of Pushya (Pausha) ; Vaqdavára ; the uttarayana-sainkranti or winter solstice. In respect of this dato Dr. Fleet gives mo the following remarks :-"The Prabhava

samvatsara in question, as a lunar year according to the southern lunisolar system of tho ogolo, began on 8 March, A.D. 1087. The givon tithi Pausha krishna 13 ended at about 16 hrs. 40 mia. aftor mean sunrise (for Ujjain) on 26 Deoembor, which was to Saturday. Thu winter solstice, as marked by the sun entoring the sign Makara, occurred at 20 hrs. 40 min. on the preceding day; that is, at 3 hrs. 20 min. boforo the sunrigo at the end of tho Friday: and on any celebration of it would naturally be made on the Saturday. Accordingly, this dato works nut satisfactorily for Saturday, 28 December, A.D. 1087." 
*This dato gives another instance of the 1:60 of the torm Vaddavära, which is rare and noteworthy, to donote Saturday. The first componont of the nume, vadla, is derived front the Sanskrit vriddha, 'incroased, augmented, niado prosperous'. Saturn, we know, was held to be a very malignant planet: in fact, both he and Mars, the lord of Tuosday, liad the namo krüra-dris, 'epil-eyed'. And & verbe in Ranna's Kanarese Sithilsiz-Bhimie-ui jurut, written about A. D. 1000, ropresents the namos Mangalavāra (the most usual toro for Tuosday) and Vadda vāra (Saturday) as euphemiams, adopted in order to mako pooplo forget tho igauspicious nature of the two days.? 
In the second dato tho details are the Sobhakpit sa invatsara, being the forty-eighth year of the Chälukya-Vikramna-varshn; the twelfth tithi, horo called Srazylind-(dvilasi, of tho bright fortnight of Bhādrapada ; Somavāra. Dr. Float gives me the following remarks about this date :- Tho Sobhaksit or Sobhann suinvetsara bogau on 28 Fobruary, A.D. 1123. Tho givon tithi Bhadrapada sukla 12 began at very closoly about 12 hrs. 3 min. after menn sunrise (for Ujjain) on Monday, 3 Soptember. This tithi is known as Sravaņa-dvādagi wlion it is joined with tbc Sravaņu nakshatra. On this occasion tho moon entered Sravana at about 6 hrs. 18 min, after moan Runriso on that same day, Monday, and was in that niksluatru when the given tithi began and for some oighteen and a half hours aftorwards. This accounts for the rithi being hero called by tho special name, and used with tho weekday on which it bocan instead of that on which it ended. Accordingly, this dato answord quito rogularly to Monday. 3 September, A.D. 1123," 
As to the places mentionod in tho record, Nirugumda, i.e. Nīrugunda (II. 64, 77), is of course the modern Nilgunda itself. Tho first component of tho Danio is the Kinarogo nir. niru, 'wator': and the niodori form gives Another instance of the interchange between yo and I in the vernaculars which is too well known to uood illustration. The second component. gunda, kunda (see also tho next paragraph), is not found in dictionaries, but is probably connectod with tho Telugu gunta, explained in Brown's Dictionary, now edition, as al pit, bolo. hollow, dell'; tho Kanarose kundi, tentatively explained by Kittoi as 'low or lx:ut ground'; and the Tamil kundu, to sit or squat'. The whole namo thus scoms to mean "watery lowland". The record placos Nirugnada, Nilgundo, in a group of villagos knowo as tho Vikkiga twelvo. which was in the Kökali five-hundred district (1. 63). Tho namo Vikkiga cannot bo traced now; unless (which is not very likely) it might bo found in the "Bikkikatti" of tho map), six miles towards the south-south-Odst from Nilgundu. Tlu Kökali fivo-hundred is ovidently the Kögali-nád which is mentioned in inscriptions of A.D. 982, 1071, and 1108 ;t its chief

town plainly still survives in the place in the Hivina-Hadagalli talaka which is shown as "Kogali" in the Indian Atlas sheet No. 59, N. W. (1901), in lat. 14° 56', long. 76° 13', fifteen miles towards tho north-east from Harpanhalli and twenty-two miles in the same direction from Nilgunda. Tho hamlets Adityapallika and Krishnapallika and the villagos Talovágya, Kamondrlukārpūga, Tilaka, and Lākshāgüha, which aro mentioned in the specification of boundaries, cannot be traced in the map. On the occasion ia A.D. 1087, whop the grant was first made, the king was at his oppital city, Kalyanapura (1. 62): this is Kalyani in the Bidar District of the Nizam's territory. On the occasion in A.D. 1123, when the grant was repeated, he was in camp at Vaijayantīpura (1. 65-6): this is well known as an ancient name of Banawisi in the North Kanara District, Bombay. 
In connoction with the word guada, kunda, as the second componont of the name Niragundn, Nilgunda, Dr. Fleet gives mo the following remarke :"Some other places in the namos of which this terın oocars are as follows: Hungund, a tāluka town in the Bijāpår District, Bombay : its name is found as Ponugunda in an inscription of A.D. 10491 here ponu doubtless stands for pon, hon, honnu, 'gold'. Mulgund, a village in the Gadag tāluka, Dhūrwar District, Bonibny : its name is given as Mugunda in inscriptions of A.D. 866 and 902,—the latter at the place itself:2 here mul is, no doubt, mulu, mullu, a thorn': in the spurious Kurtakoti grant, & final u is addod, and tho name is presented as Mulgundu.> Nilgund, a village in the same tālako: ito nano, which is identical with that of Mraganda, Nilgunda, and has the same derivation from nir, 'water', is given as Nirgunda in the inscrip tion of A.D. 866 at the place itself, and as Nilagunda (in Sanskrit vorse), with the change from r to l established, in tho Dambal plates of A.D. 1379 :* in the inscription of A.D. 982 at the place itself, tho namc, for some inexplicable roason, is misspolt as Nirgunda, with tho coro. bral ny. Nawalgund, a tālaka town in the Dhārwar District : here the first term is plainly naval, 
peacock'. Nargund, a town in the Nawalgund taluka : the strict form of this Daine 800ms to be Naraganda, Narugunda, with nara, naru, 'fragrance, scont'. o Wokkund, the “Wakand" and "Wakkund" of maps, etc., a village in the Sampganm taluka of the Belgaum District, Bombay: this place is mentioned as Onkunda, and ag ynarking the northern livit of the purest Kanazoso, in chapter I, verso 37, of the Kanareso Kavirājamārga, written between A.D. 814 and 877: the first torm is perhaps ondu, 'ono', which becomes Ok in composition before a k; or perhaps it reprosents vana, 'a wood, forost', a local pronunciation of which is onu, wona : e.g. Pandavarig-ona-desa band-ante aditat, in the Ballad of the Daughter-in-law of Channavva of Kittir. Tålgand, a village in the Shikārpār tāluka of the Shimoga District. Mysoro: in records at tho placo itself, this name is found 88 Sthana kundāra (Sapskrit) in the Early Kadamba inscription of about A.D. 501-50, 8 and as sthānakundur (Kanarese) in an inscription of A.D. 1028 ;9 28 Taņagundur in inscriptions

A photograph of the Copper plate was published on the first and the third occasion, bo$ as tho plate was covcrod with powdered chalk before photographing it, the reproduction was uvither exactly mechanical nor perfect. I obtained a loan of the plate through Mr. L S. S. 
S., Superintendent, Orissa Fondatory States. After careful oxamination, I found that on all three occasions a pumber of mistakes had cropt into the published tort. The most important defect was the reading of the name of Kanchanastambhah as Kanchanas bhana, 1.3. 
The inscription has been incised on both sides of a single plate of copper measuring 87" x 59", and the letters measure t' on the average. A round soal of the same metal is affixed to the left of the plato, op the reverse of which is the word “Talcher " soratched thinly in Roman letters. Tho impression on the soal is circular and consists of a plain cirole with & row of lotus petals along its circumferenco. The circlo is divided into two unequal parta by twa raised parallel linos, in the larger and upper of which is a deer couchant with a boagh or some foliage in its month and a crescent and a conch over its back. Below it, just above the dividing lines, is the name of the king, fri-Kulastambhadžvu. The lower part of the circla below the lines is occupied by an expanding lotus flower. The inscription rocorda the grant of a piece of laud to Bhatta Vidvardpa, the grandson of Yadu, and the son of Anantari pa, in tho village of Singa in the Western part (paschima-khands) of the Eastern Distriot (Paruva. visliaya). The value of the land granted is given in the last line the rüpya 44. Throo generations of the dynasty are montioned in the inscription: 
Kancbanastambha. Kalabastambha (Vikramaditya). Rapastambha alias Kulastambha. 
The record was inscribed by one Dörvvadāsa, and it is apparently complete, though it ende Abruptly with the word chatunsim..parya. 
The characters of the inscription belong to the 9th century A.D., and the language is incorrect Sanskrit, thongh the mistakes are not so many as Båbo Nagendr Natha Vasa Prachyavidyāmalárpava thinka. The learned gentleman is not goito correot when he asporta that the figure of a boar and an elephant goad (askusa), the emblems of the Early Chalukyan, are to be found ou the sal

· Two grants of this prince, Kalastambhadeva, foand in the Raghava monastery at Puri have been edited by Baba Manmohan Chakravarttil. The name of the country read as Kėdalu in those plates is very clearly written as Kodalo in the Talcher plate, and this is probably the correot reading. If this be admitted, thon Baba Någondra Natha Vasu Prachyavidyāmahär. pava's identification of this country with the Paschima-Kidara, said to have been discovored by him in certain three dundred years old gonealogical works on palm-loaf, must be abandonod.

NO. 21.-DALAVAY-AGRAHARAM PLATES OF VENKATAPATIDEVA. 
MAHARAYA I;SAKA-SAMVAT 1508. BY T. A. GOPINATIA Rao, M.A. ; TRIVANDRUM. 
The subjoined inscription is engraved on nine copper-platos shaped in the usual manner of the later Vijayanagara platos; 1.0, with a ourved top, in which is bored u holo which receives the ring and seal, and with raisod rims. The first side of the first plate and the second side of the last plato-the two expored sidos-are loft blank. The plates, with the exception of the first, are numbered with Telugu.Kannada numorals, which aro engraved on tho left margin near the ring-hole. The 6th and 7th plates have boon wrongly oumbered as 7 and 8 respectively, whilo the 8th is marked 6. The inscription is well prosorved. On my ac count, Mr. M. K. Nārāyapasāmi Ayyar, B.A., B.L., High Conrt Vakil, Madras, roquested Mr. Kuppa Rao of Dadikkomba to secure for him from Anautāchārya of the Dalavāy-Agrahāram Street, Madura, this and some other sets of copper-plates ; Mr. Kuppu Rao was kind onough to procure them on loan for Mr. Når.y&pasāmi Ayyar, who in his tura holped me with excellent sots of improssions of these copper-plates. I edit the record publishod below from tho imprese sions supplied by him. 
The alphabet of the document is Nandinagari; the solitary word Sri-Verikațzóit rised as their signature by kings of the third Vijayanagara dynasty, is in the Telugu-Kannada chaructors. The language of the record ia Sanskrit. The ono orthographical pocaliarity worth noticing is that, as in one or two other grants of the Vijayanagara dynasty,' distinction is made between initial long & and short e. The ordinary & is rotained to express the short vowel sound; a secondary e symbol over the short e, which makes really ai in other inscriptions, converts it into a long 8. The vowel as is written with two secondary a symbols on tho short e. Por example, ēkam, I, 172 ; etyeka, 1. 207; ēkaiva, 1. 327 and aifanyam in l. 116. Other minor peculiarities are noted in the foot-notes under the text of the inscription. 
The last words are probably meant as an addition to singagramah, I. 27. The grant is, so far as I understand, complete.

(The fourth from him) Tata-Pinnama. 
The regular genealogy begins from Tăta-Pindama and runs as follows:

captured Kandana voli-durgam (i.. Kurnool). Here he was poisoned by his relatives but by the grace of Vishpa be was saved, (Vv. 11-12). 
The genealogy given in this grant agroos as far 46 Tiramalarāya, with those given in the Kopdyata, the Kallakursi,s the Küniyors and the Vil&ppākkam grants. Like the last one, the present record also mentions only Ranga II. and Venkatapati I. as the sons of Tirumalarāya omitting Rāma III. and Raghunătha, who are mentionod in the Kordyte grant. 
The prosent inscription is dated the sake year 1508, computed by the moon, the arrows, the sky and the valus, whion corresponds to the opolio year Vyaya. On the Utthiina. dvadasi tithi of the bright half of the month Karttika, Vonkatapatidėva-Mahārāya gruntod, at the roqueat of Virabhupa, the village of Gangavarappatti, under the name of Virabhū. pa-samudram, to a number of Brāhmapas. The grant was made in the presonco of tho goc Veikatosa of Tirupati. As in the other grants, Vonkatapatidõvarāya I. is described as having Vanqnished Malikıbhardma's son Mahamandag.hu, (V, 30), who has beon identified by Dr. Haltzsch with the Golkonda kiog Mabammad Shah, son of Ibrāhim Shal, who reigned from 1581-1011, A. D. 
We know from the Viļāpp&kkam grant that Venkatapatidõva had fivo wipos; of thoso Venkatambé, Rügbavimbā, Pedobamimbă and Ksishņamāmbă are mentionod in our inscrip tion; mention is not made of Kopdāmbika, perhaps buoa uae nt tho timao of the issue of this grant, which is fiftoon yoars earlier than that of the Viļõppakkam grant, he had not marriud this lady. 
The birudas of Veokatapatidova (Vv. 32-39) aro identical with thoso given in the vther grants, and have already been explainod by the editors of those graats. 
Venkatapatidõva, like many other kings of the Vijayanagara dynasty, was a great devoteo of the god Venkaçõsa of Tirupati. A life sizo bronze ata tuo of this king is placed in the temple at Tirumala on the Tirnpati hilla, and some sort of pūjt is offorod daily to it and also to tho bronze images of the great Krishṇaddyurāya and his two heroio, queons, Chianidoví and Tiranaladovi. 
The prince Virabhupa, at whose requost the grant was made, was the son by Lakshmamd, of Krishna-aripati and the grandaon of Visvanatha. He boars the birudas Samaya-drõhard ganda, Ayyavall-puravar-ddhisvara, (Ailīvajipura of other rocords), and Dukshinasamudrosu (V. 7). Virabhūpa, the grant relates, constructed a mandapa with finely sculptured pillars in the temple of Sundaranayaka at Madura (V, 68). He gave to the goddons Minākshi of tho sanno place an armour atadded with gems (ibidem). A Tamil work called the Tiruppani-mälui, wbich describes in detail the donations made by various persons to the templo of Minākshi and Sandarádyara of Madara, atates that Krishpa-Virappa-Nayaka oonstractod (re-constructed ?) the Veffiyambalam, the northern Gopuram, the shrine callod Sovvisvaran, the kitchen, es also the thousand pillarod mandapa, the Mürttiyamman-mandapa, the Surru-mandapa of the socond prakāra, and the Virappa-inangapa with sculptured pillars. He also covered the pillars of a mandapa of the temple of Minākshl with gold. Viruppu-mandapa is perhaps the one that is referred to in the prosent grant. 
This and the other graata of Venkatapatidõvarðya mention that the king was anointed on the throne by his family priest Tātācharge. Who this Tātãoharya was, how he becamo the family priest of the kings of Vijayanagara, and when and in what ciroumstances the lattor embraced Vishnuiem, all these are interesting questions which have hitherto romainod

unexplained. Chapters 23 to 26 of the Prapannamrita, a work on the hierarchy of the Brivaish nayas, giro a guccinot account of the family of the Tātacharyas, the denoondants of Srisailanátha, better known by his familiar dame Periya Tirumalai-nambi. The family to which the T&tiohiryas bolong, is called the Srisaila vanhda after this original ancestor of theirs. He was the maternal uucle of the great Britaishpaya acharya Ramanuja, and also one of the Ave disciples of Yamunārya, who was the immediate guru of Rāmānoja. In the Srikaila-vanhia were born two brothers, Narasimhacharya and Rangacharya. These were great specialista in expounding the epio Rāmāyapa, liko all the members of the family beginning from Periya Tirumalai-nambi. They both went to Dyfür with a desire to oarn money by expounding the Rāmāyapa. Not finding Ettür suffioiontly paying, they drifted on to Vijayanagara, the capital of the kings of that dynasty. Thero, the king Viri pāksba was then ruling in great splendoar. His relatives, cuvious of his prosperity, attempted to assassinate him, but he escaped to the adjacent country, guthored enough soldiers, and returned to Vijayanagara one night and killed the whole lot of his relatives in thoir beds. Tha, suddonly murdered and left without any obsequios, they all became pilachas, and began to haunt the house in which they had been killed. So, Virūpāksha built for himself a new palace and lived in it. However, the trouble due to the ghosts did not dense, and no amount of poace-offering would offeot any change in their attitude towards him. At this juncture the two brothers happened to go to Vijayanagara; they wont straight into the haunted bouso, mistaking it for the residence of the king. The place was well lit and the ghost princo was holding a darbär into which the two brothers were ushered by a ghost servant. On being quostioned by the ghost king who they were and what they wanted, the younger brother introduced his older brother ar a great oxpounder of the Rāmāyana, and stated that they both went there to seek the royal patronage. The ghost prince commanded them daily to read and explain tho Rāmāyaṇa to him in his palace and promised in return for it a dinara a day and a largo sum of money on the day on which the portion relating to the paffabhishoka of Rama was to be road. Thoy agreed to the proposal, and the recital of the Ramayana went on day after day, whon Gnally they were rewarded amply for their trouble on the pattabhisheka day. The ghosts, as an effect of the virtue of listening to the Råmāyana, went direot to the Santanika-loka. beiog ireed from their ghost oxistence. This service of the brothers of the Briggila-varsa did indirectly a great good to tho reigning prince by removing from him all the troubles he was soffering in the hands of the ghosta, He discovered hia benefactors and requested them to recito tho Rāmāyana in his palace also and loaded them at the end with riches and himself became the disciple of the older brother, Narasimhãohárya (who is better known to the Srivaishnayas as Étýir Singarāobāryn) and changed the royal signature from Viräpaksha to Venkatdia. 
The ninth in descent from this Narasimh.ohārya was Tatarya. He was the oontemporary of a Ramadhya, with whom he retired to Chandragiri. This Tatarya lived contemporaneously with Vadbala Doddayāchárya of Chojasingapuram (Sholingur), the author of the Ohan damárutam, a work written in rofatation of the Advaitadipika of Appayya Dikabita. We know from the Vilāppäkkam grant that Appayya Dikshita WAS '& contemporary of Venkatapatidevaraya I. Hence, the Tatárga montigned above (also known as the Pancha-mata-bhatjanam Tātachārya, a name which he derived from his work, Pancha-mata-bhatjana), Doddaykohärya aud Appayya Dikshita were of the same time. Lakshmikanina Titacharya, who wae more familiarly known as Koca-kanyaka-danam Tatiaharya, was the son of Pancha-mata-bhatjanam Tatacharya. This Lakshmikumāra war the guru of Vonkatapatidóvariya, who granted his whole kingdom to his acharya. This same person should, therefore, be the guru who is

mentioned in copper-plate grants as having performed the pattabhishoka ceremony for the king, That he was in great power at that time, in evidenced by the large number of insoriptions of T&t&charya found on the walls of the Varadarajasyimin temple at Conjesveram, whither he had removed his quarters in a later period of his life. The sathor of the Prapannāmata was the disciple of Ranganatha, the grandson of Lakshmikumāra Tátáchārya and belonged to the family of Andhraparpa (Vadaganambi), one of the favourite disciples of Rāmdauja. 
Below are given two lists, the one detailing the doneos and the shares they each recoived etc., and the other giving the names of places occurring in the document, which are as far as possible identified therein with the modern damos. 
The person who composed the sāsana was Krishpa-kavi Kāmakoti, the grandson of Sabhāpati and the engraver was Virandcharya, the son of Ganapaya. A considerable number of tho Verses of our document are found in the Mangalampad grant of Venkata I., where it is stated that the composer of the versos was one Chidambara-kavi, sister's son of Sivasarya, the king of poets ; whereas the Kaniyür plates, tho Viļappákkam, Koodgata and Kallakursi grants, which contain many of the same verses 88 our document, are said to be the composition of Rāma, the son of Kamakoti and the grandson of Sabb&pati; & similar grant belongs to the Kidli Spingöri Syimi'a matha, and the writing is claimed thore by Krishnakavi Kamakoti, the grandson of Sabbā pati. Thus there is a great deal of divergence in the statement as to the actual aathorship of the composition. It appears that some one of the earlier members of the family, Sabhāpati or somu one else, for instance, was the actual author, and every time his verses woro ropeated and nddod to in drawing ap frosh documents by the various later members of the family, tho composition was olaimed to be his by the copyist. The copyist in the prosent oase appears, as in tho caso of the Kūdli matha plates, Krishna-kayi.

This inscription is engraved on four sides of a pillar of the mandapa in front of the Vira. bhadrasvåmin templo at Mötupalli in the BÆpațla talaka of the Guptor district, I edit it froma. a set of excellent inked estampages received from Rao Sahib H. Krishna Sastri, who has alrendy 
With the exception of a few syllablos near the edges of the pillar (e.g. in 11. 169-171), tho inscription is well preserved. The alphabet is Telugu. The characters are on the wholo well formed, but there are some letters (e.g. the dentals, linguals, r, l, and v) which it is pot quite casy to distingaish from cach other without paying regard to tho context. Thò lingual { is usod twice in the word parkiļa (Il. 89 f., 102). Of poouliar spellings may be mentioned klupta for klipta (11. 85, 149) and yarvana for yauvuna (1. 13). 
Tbe languages are Sanskrit (11. 1-152,166-173) and Telugu (11. 152-166). The Sanskrit portion consists mostly of vorges, which are 29 in number (II. 2-134, 166-173). The remainder of tho inscription is in prose. Of rare Sanskrit words the following deserve to be noted -anta: ripa, fan island' (line 136 f.); analiman, fpurity' (verse 17); afviya, 'a number of horses' (v. 20); anunilathu, tjoy (v.1); imrêdana, 'repetition' (v.4); asvamadha=asvamēdhika (v. 18. upart rinkh, 'to spread (v. 27) ; üshmala, 'glowing' (v. 13); kan, 'to glitter (v. 16); kalamba, 'an arrow' (v. 12); kridayita, 'sporting' (v.4); ganda, ' a hero' (. 18); the samegandasaila, A bouldor' (v. 26) ; gunja, 'a kottlo-drum' (v. 23) ; ghriņi, 'a ray' (v. 27) ; damara, tumaltaone, terrible' (v. 20), Tridaśaparivsidha=Indra (v. 13); Padmavast=Lakshmi (v. 5); parimatang, 6 cracking (v. 18); Maghavanmanie Indranila (v. 27); rangat,' rolling '(v.3);& lambapataha, " a kind of drum' (vy. 12, 25); Lopamudradayita=Agastya (v. 15); Srivatsavakshare Vishna

The Motapalli pillar-inscription is an edict of the (Kakatiya) Maharaja Ganapatidēva (), 135 f.). It opons with an invocation of Svayambhádova. From the Prataparudriya wo kaow that Siva under the name Svayambhudova was the family-deity (kula-dåvata) of the Kakatiya dynasty, s Verses 1-4 of the inscription invoko Gapēda, Sarasvati, the digit of the moon on Siva's head, and the Boar-incarnation of Vishộu, respectively. Verses 5-15 contain a mythical and legendary genealogy of the Kakatiya kings. Verse 8 introduces Visbạn, from the lotus on whoso navol sprang Brahma. From the Creator's eye the sun was produoed (y. 6), and from the latter Manu (v.7). In this family (vis. the surya-vania), was born Ikshváka (v. 8), in his family Mandhatri (v. 9), and in his family Sagara (v. 10), whose sons were burnt by Kapila, but attained salvation through the austerities of Bhagiratha (v. 11). In this family was born Raghu (v. 12), and in his family Dasaratha, who, being mounted on Indra

Tho first king of this pedigree, Prola I., is not mentioned id any othor Kakatiya inscription bat the Moţapalli one, and in a Kánchi inscription the construction of tho Kesarin tauk is attributed to (his grandson) Prola II. The successors of Prola I. aro namod in the same order - in other Kakatiya insoriptions. Here and in a Hanamkonda inscription, the second king bears the name Tribhuvanamalla, while a Chõbrola inscription calls him Bota," and tho Kanchi inscription Betma.

General Cunningham 1 and Colonel Yule pointed out that Mötupalli is mentioned by the Venetian traveller Maroo Polo, who calls it Mutili. "This was formerly under the rule of a king, and since his death, somo forty years past, it has been under his queen.!'. By this king and his queen are meant Ganapati and his daughter (not queen) Rudramba. s Rai Baha. dur Venkayya showed that the former reigned sixty-two years, from A.D. 1199-1800 to 1280-81, when he was succeeded by Rudramba. * Maroo Polo is supposed to have visited South India boat A.D. 1290%3 bas, however, he dictatod his work to his fellow prisonor Rusticiano at Genos in A.D. 1298-99, 8 his statement that about forty years had then passed after Rud tõmba's aocossion to the throne turns out to be fairly correct. He mentions as chiof produce of the country diamonds which "are found both abundantly and of large size," 7 and muslios which "look liko tissue of spider's web." 8 As he calls the whole Kakatiya kingdom atter Mutfili, it sooms that this town was its ahief port in the thirteenth century. The fact that Ganapati solectod Motupalli as the site of his edict to mariners points to the same conclusion.

TRANSLATION OF THE GRANT PORTION. (Lino 135.) By this glorious Maharaja Ganapatidáve the following edict (alstring) safety has been granted to traders by sea starting for and arriving from all continents, islanda foreign countries, and cities. 
(L. 140.) Formorly kings used to take away by force the whole cargo; vis. gold, elephants, horses, gems, etc., curried by ships and vessels which, after they had started from one country for another, were attacked by storms, wrecked, and thrown on shore. 
(L. 146.) But We, out of meroy, for the sake of glory and merit, are granting everything besides the fixod duty to those who have incurred the great risk of a nee-voyage with the thought that wealth is more valuable than even life.

No. 23.-HANSOT PLATES OF THE CHAHAMANA BHARTRIVADDHA 
SAMVAT 813. 
* BY STEN KONOW. 
These plates belong to Sukla Dalpatram in Hannot, a town in the Anklesvar tälnka of the Bronch District, Bombay, situated in 21° 35' N. and 729 48. ., on the left bank of the Narbadā. There are apparently two plates, measuring 114" x 84, the first of which carries tweuty and the second 16 lines of writing. The existence of the platos was already known to the late Profos sor Kielhorn, who possessed a photograph of them.and a somowhat fuller netice has been given by Mr. D. R. Bhandarkar, who has also boon good enongh to let me have impressions of the plates. 
The writing seems to be, in sovoral places, rather indistinot. Moreover the portion of the grant containing the names of the donees has, according to Mr. Bhandarkar, ovidointiy boou tampered with. It is not therefore possiblo to read the wholo grant with certainty. Evorything however which is of importance from the point of view of history, can be made out. 
The alphabet belongs to the southern class and is most closely related to that in aso in the Valabbi inscriptions. « The form of the initial ū in l. 33 is peculiar. The name is the case with the inilial o in I. 32, f. I. 19. The shape of individual aksharas is also in other instances iucon. migtont. Thus the fa in -Dhrubhafa-, l. 9, looks almost like du, and tho Ith in =chal urithabhãouh. 1. 15. is different from the form bred elsewhere in the inscription. Tho shape of the compound 
I okkumati-digumaţi must be the same asegumati-digumatt, export and import; shipping and unshipping in Brown's Telugu Dictionary. 
ga in the usual abbroviation for ganda or gadyama, 'pagoda ;' sed ühove, Vol. VIII, p. 130. The symbol which marks the next coin of lower denomination is perhaps meant for räka, 's fanam,' which, sccording to Brown's Telugu Dictionary, osod to be abbreviated by an . Here and in the next lines, is exprousel by e vertical line and t by . horizontal danb; cf. Rao Sahib Krishna Sastri's remarka, above, Vol. VIII, p. 130. Por specimens of British coins on which the synonymous torms rüka (Telugn), panam (Tamil), fulum (Persian), and fanan (English) occur, see Edgar Thurston's Coinage of the East India Company (Madras, 1890), Plate xiv. 5-6. and Plate xvi. 9. 
pomkals (also above, Vol. VI, p. 288, text lia. 145) is the same su påkals in Brown's Telaga Dictionary.

nda, in which the da looks like dha, is also.unod in Valabhi insoriptions. It is possible that the samo form of d is also used in the compound which I bave read ddh in Dharirivad dhan, 11. 6. 11, 30. Mr. Bhandarkar reads this name as Bhartrivaddah, and he is perhaps right, because the word vadda, great, is a well-known Prakrit word.* Tho sign for final & oocurs in. I. 88 and the nameral symbols for 800, 10 and 3 are used in l. 36. The symbol for 800 has been formed in the way which is well known from other higher aumerals by adding the symbol for 8 after the symbol for 100. The visarga has apparently been used as a sign of interpunotion in ll. 33 and 34. 
With regard to orthography we may note å for in in Evarisē, 1.2 (bnt-vandyait. 1.21), and the common doubling of consonants after r; thus svarggě, l. 31; Kirttys, li 7; chaturttha-, Il. 15, 16; "pravarddhamana., 1. 34; dharmma, ll. 27, 30; suryya-, 1. 14; - pūruvath, 1. 15, etc. The doubling is not however consistent; compare adhvaryu-, ll. 13, 17; -purva, 1. 19, but-puruvan, 1. 15, and Arjuna-, 11, 14, 18, 19.

In spite of such instancos of carelessnos9, however, I do not doubt that the grant is a genuine 000, excepting of course the portion containing the names of the donees. 
The grant belongs to a hitherto unknown branch of the Chabamānas, who must have resident in Broach. Tho name Chahumāna itself is not distinctly legible in the impreusions. Professor Kielhorn and Mr. Bhandarkar however have both road it, the former in a photograph of the first plate, the latter in the original, and the signs which can be road in the impressions favour this roading. The family worshipped Siva, as will be seen from the attribute Paramamahétvara attachod to the names of two of its members, and from the damo Mahēšvaradama worn by the first member mentioned in the grant. We are introduced to six generations. First we have the Rajan Mabēśvaradāma. His son was tho illustrious Bhimadama, the father of Bhartriyaddha I., whose son again was Haradāma, the father of Dhrubhaçadēva, whose son Bhartrivaddha 11, issued the present grant. Bhartsivaddha II. was an ardent worshipper of Mahosvark (Biva). and he is styled a Mahasimantadhipati, who had obtained the five nahatabdas, s.e. he was a fondatory prince. Ho must have lived about the middle of the sighth. century, and if we allow thirty prare for each generation his family may be traced back to about 500 A.D. It will be goen thut Bhartsivaddha's father had the namo Dhribhata, which is a shortened form of Dhruyabhata. It is worth noting that the same name Dhrubhata was used as a surname by tho Valabhi Muharăjidhiraju Silúditya VII., whoso Alind plates* are dated Valabbi Samrat

447, 4.6. A.D. 768. Bhartriraddha II. was accordingly a contemporary of Šiladitya VII. and also of his father Bildditya VI. The use of the same name in the same vernacular form at about the same time in two families, wbich ruled os neighbours to each other, can hardly be sooidental, if we remember that Siladitya VII. is the first one in five generations of Valabhi ralers who mentions any quob surname, and also that the namo Dhruvabbata or Dhräbhaça does pot oocar elsewhere in the genealogy of the Valabhi kings. It seems probable that there bas been some connexion botween the two families, and it is possible that Bhartrivaddha Il.'s sister was married to Silăditya VI., so that 'Sılāditya VII. may have worn the name of his maternal grandfather. 
• Bhartriyuddha is clearly designated as a feudatory prince, and it scems also possible to decide to which dynasty he owed allegiance. The Hinsoţ platos are dated, in 11. 34 ft., during the roine of a king Nägávalóka, and in the year (sanvatsara) 813, and the grant was issued on tho occasion of an eclipse' of the sun (11. 14 and 19). There can be no doubt that this date should be referred to the Vikrama era, and as such it has been calonlated by the lato Profossor Kielhora? to correspond to the 88th Ootober 768 A.D. 
The identity of the paramount sovereign of the Broach Chăhamūnas, king Nägivaloka, wag not at first apparent. Professor Kielborn was inclined to identify him with the Nāgāvaloka who is mentioned in the Harsha inscription of Vigraharāja, where we are told in v. 13 that the Chibamina Gavaka I."attained to pre-eminence as the hero in the assembly of the glorion, Nagávaloka, the foremost of kinga." In his Synchronistio Tablo for Northern India* Kielhorn bad suggested that this Nāgāvaloka might by identical with the Pratihúra Någabhata, but later 00% be oame to differont results and reminded of the fact that names ending in avalóka are ased as birudas of Råsbtrakota kings. Also Mr. Bhandarkar was originally inclinod to think that Någaveloka was a Rashtrakata. Later on, however, he has discussed the question again! and arrived at results whioh will, I think, be generally accopted. 
A closer examination of the facts shows that king Någåvaloka of the Hangot plates cannot bo identical with the Nāgåvaloka of the Harsha Inscription. The latter is dated in A.D. 973 in the reign of Vigraharāja. Now Gävaka, the contemporary of Nāgūvaloka, was six gonorations removed from Vigraharaja and may accordingly be dated about A.D. 820, which would then be the time of Nāgāvaloka. This same Någāvaloka is probably also alluded to in the Pathürī pillar insoription of Parabala, which is dated on the 21st Maroh A.D. 861. We are there told that Parabala's fatber, the Rashtraktta Karkkarája, defeated kiog Någåvaloka (vv. 14 f.), whose time we would naturally suppose to have been about A.D. 830. It sooms natural to infer from the way in which I Āyaloka is mentioned in both inscriptions that ho was a ruler of considerable importance, and I think it will be generally agreed that Mr. Bhandarkar has been right in returning to Professor Kielhorn's old identification of this Någavaloka with king Nagabhata of the imperial Pratihira dynasty. We know of him that he conquered king Chakriyadaa of Kamanj and forinded the imperial Pratibira dynasty, which ruled over a largo portion of Nožthern India from that city for about two centuries. Mr. Bhandarkar has showalo that this

whether 
Pratihära Nagabhata is identical with the Paramabhattaraka Mahardjadhiraja Paraméivara' Någabhatta, whose Buchkala inscription is datod Vikrama Sarvat 872, i.e. A.D. 818. Napage bhatta was the son of the Maharajadhirija Paramęsvara Vatsardja, and this Vatearáta is noi doubt the rulor montioned at the earl of the Jaina work Zarionmapurana, where we road,

saurānamwadhimandalan jaya-yutē virë Varahēmvati || We learn from this stanza that Vatsa raled in the west in Saka 705, ie. A.D. 789, at a period when Kannuj was still under the rule of king Indräyudha, who is certainly the king. Indraraja whom king Dharmapala defeated, after which he gave the sovoreignty of Kanauj tos Chakråyadha. Now the Hiusot plates are dated in A.D. 756, and Bhartrivaddha's overlord Nágåvaloka cannot therefore be identical with the Pratihara Nagabhatta, the son of Vatsardja Mr. Bhandarkar is however no doubt right in identifying him with an older Nägabhata, of the samo family, whose name occars in tho Gwalior prasceti of the reiga of Bhojadeve, an edition of which we owe to Mr Bhandarkar himself. The genealogy of the Pratihāras is here carried back one generation further than in the materials utilized by Profobgor Kiolhom in his lista. After obeisance to Vislipu we are introdaced to the Sun, in whose lineage Rama arose Rama's brother Saumitri (Lakshmana) aoted as repellor, or perhaps, as doorkeeper (pratthāra) in the. lot of ropelling (the foes) in the fight against. Mõghanāda. In his lineage arose Nagabhate I., who is said to havu conquorod the armies of the Valachas-mláchchhae, i.e. of the Balachas. His. brothor's son was Kakkuka, who had a younger brother Devaraja, who is evidently identioxl. with the Maharaja Dévasakti of Professor Kiellorn's list. Dövarāja's son wa. Vatsaraja, who " seized by main force the imperiul sway from the famous house of Bhandi." Vatsaraja's son Again was Nagabbata II., who is described as a valiant warrior, and who is also stated; to, hava defeated Chakrāyudha. 
It will be seen that it is this second Nagablata who must be identified with the Någāvaloka of the Harsha and Patbari inscriptions. Någüvaloka of the Hansot plates, on the other hand, Mr. Bhandarkar idontifies with Nāgabhata I., and I think that this identifiontind can safely be. Adopted, If Vatsaraja ruled in A.D. 783, Nagabhata, who was the brother of his grandfather, may well have been on tho throue in A.D. 756, the date of our inscription. The wording of the Gwalior inscription naturally leads us to iafor that Nigabhata's brother, the father of Kakkaka and Devarija, did not rule or that he was older than Nagabbaţa, since his name is not montioned and no particolure about him are given. The comparatively short and thoroughly conventional praise bastowod ou Kakkuka and Dövarāja makes us inclined to think that their rule must, at all ereuts, have been short, and that it may very well be compressed within the twenty-seven years intervening between the dato of the Hansot grant and A.D. 783, when Vatsarā ja bad already ascended the throne. 
I therefore agree with Mr. Bhandarkar that Nagavaloka, Bhartrivaddha's. overlord; was Någabhaça I. of the Pratihāra dynasty. His family had not however then established itself in Kanaui bat had its capital-further to the wont. Vatsarāja is in the Harivartapurāna described 4: the king of the western quarter, and if we remembor that the Avanti-kiog, 1.B. the ruler of Malwa, is said to hold sway, over the Easterp quarter, this localisation takes us to Lata and

Western Rajputand and well agrees with the fact that Någåvaloka was the overlord of the Chahaminas of Broach. Similarly the Rashtrskůta Maharajadhiraja Dhrupardja is stated to beve defeated Vstarija "in the centre of Marn." We have alao seen that Nagabhata I. is in the Chwalior insoription stated to have defeated the Balachas. What is meant is probably tho Musalman attacks on Western Räjputânå in the eighth century, Everything tonds to show that the late Mr. Jackson was right in supposing that these rulers were Gurjaras, and that their hond quarters were at Brimāla, the present Bhinmal. 
If we now turn to the family of the grantee of the Hängot platos, it will be seen that the first of his ancestors mentioned in the grant is desiguated as rajan, which does not imply that he was a ruling prince. Only conventional praise is bestowed on the four next generations. Wo are told, it is true, in the usual way that other kings bowed down to them, but there are no attributes which show that they were kinga. Tben follows Dhribhaçadova, of whom wo hear that he conquered the territories of all his adversaries and made the whole world rosplondent with his fame. His son, the issuer of the grant registered in the Hängot plates, is the first in tho family who is oxpressly designated as a fondatory rulor. Now assuming that he hold sway over Bronch, it is in itself little likely that his ancestors should havo ruled over that part of India. because we find the Garjaras in power down to A.D. 736. It is of interest to notes how the Gariards of Broaoh, who wore originally worshippers of tbe Sun, became Saivas from tho reigu of Dadda III., who lived at the end of the seventh century. His aon Jayabhnţa Ill., whore copperplate grants are dated A.D. 706 and 735, is the last of those rulera who is known to us, llo is said to have obtained the five great sounds and to have been a MahIsamantadhiputz,in othor words he uses exactly the same titlos as Bhartsivaddha II. It seems nataral to infor that the line of Garjara foudatorios in Broach became oxtinct with Jayabbata III., and that he was saoceodod as rulor by the prince Bhartsiraddha, who was a Chåhamana, and who owed allegianou to the Gariaras of Bhinmil, as had probably also been the case with his prodoconsors of the Bronchi dynasty of Gurjaras. 
The grant was issued from Bbfigukaohohha, whioh cannot be anything else than a somi. learned Sanskrit form of the name Bharukachchha, the present Brosch. Tho same form also ocoors in the Bagumrá plates of Dhruvarija II. of Saka 7896 and olsuwhore. The grant rocords the gift of the village Arjunadovigrama in the Akrürəsvara vishaye. Akrirośvara in the present Anklośvar tälaka in the Broach District, but I aiu not able to idontify Arjunudovigrama. It has already been mentioned that the namos of the lonces have boon tumporod with. Tlut portion of the inscription cannot therefore be read with certainty. Tho donees seem to be the Brahmana Bhatta-Būta (?), the son of Tāvi, residing in Saujõapadra (?), tho Brahmapa Jaba (P), the son of Charamašarman (?) and a resident of Varamõvi (?) and tho Brahmapa Bhatalla, tho son of Bhatta-V, . ., residing in Saujñapadra (?). I canuot identify Saujña padra and Varamõvi and the reading of the names themselves is not cortain. The writer of the grant was Bhatta-Kakka (?), the son of Bhatta-Vatauva, and is called a Valabhya, 1.6., he hailod from Valabhi. This fact hade some probability to the suggestion hazarded above that thoro may have beon some connexion between Bhartsivaddha's family and the Maitralius of Valabhi. 
? See the discussion of this matter by the late Mr. Jackson, Bombay Gazettorr, Vol. I, Part I, p. 466, whore the anthorities are quoted.

No. 24.-KHAIRHA PLATES OF YASAHKARNADEVA ; 
[KALACHURI) SAMVAT 823.. 
By RAI BAHADUR HIRA LAL, B.A., JABALPOR. The Director-General of Archeology in India baving asked mo to edit this inscription I do ko from a set of estampages kindly snpplied by him. Dr. Vogel further used his good offices to secure the original plates from tho Rowah Darbår for my inspection. They were found in Kheirhā (230-12' N., 810-30' E.) by a Kotwār named Bhajuā, while digging for earth to build his house. Khairlā or Khairā, as it is marked on the topographical mapa, is a village in the Rewah State about 8 miles south-west of the Burbăr Ry, Station on the Katni-Bilaspur Branch of the Bengal-Nõgpar Ry, and about 14 miles south-oast of Sohāgpur, the lieud quarters of the tabsil of the Hamo name. The plates, two ia number, woro found with a bell. shaped seal attached to a ring in a large stone chest, and their excellent condition is duo to this fact. The total weight of the plutos and seal, all made of copper, is as much as 14 seern 5 chhittaks (nearly 29} Ibn.), 
The ring of the seal, a hugo mass of 3 seers, was found cut at ono end but all green with oxidation, which shows that the cat was not made recently. The ring is so ptout and thick that it cannot be bent withont applying somo mechanical force, and it appears that tho cut which was originally made for stringing the plates provided with suitablo holes was never soldered. The bottom of the soul is circular and bears the logund Srimad- Yasahkarnudėvah in a single line running over the diameter, which is surmounted by the figure of Gaja-Lakshmi with two elephants, one on either side, pouring water on her with thoir trunks. Below tho legend there is a figaro looking like a Nandin (boll) with a bushy tail and hump aud two other figures of what appoar to be incenbe-barnera. Letters and figures on the seal aro raised instead of being sank as on the plates, each of which is inscribed on one side only. 
The characters are Nägari neatly engraved, the average size of lettore being ". The language of the record is Sanskrit. As regards orthography thu lottor b is not distinguished from v at all, and the dental sibilant is omployed for the palatal almost universally, thore boing two instances whoro the reverse has been done, viz., in the words -blusi (l. 19) and salila. (1. 38). The old form of i somewhat resembling inverted commas in 11.8 and 30 is noticoablo. 
The inscription récords the grant of a village and consists of three parts. The first portion in a variety of metres culogizes the donor and his ancestors, the second, in proso, announces the grant, and the third gives the usual quotations of benedictive and imprecatory vcrses. The donor is king Yaśaḥkarpadēva of the Kalacburi dynusty. In this record he grants the village Dould Panchola in the Dévagrāma pattala to a Brāhmana named Gamgādhara Barman, at the time of the Sainkrānti on Sunday the 14th of the bright fortnight of the Phålguna month in the year 828. 
The genealogy of the king commences from Vishnu and rapidly passes through the moon and Kerttavirya of the Haihaya lineage to Yuvardjadēva of the Kalachuri family, the fourth Ascendant of the donor. Yuvarājadēva is mentioned as having made the town of Tripuri like Indra's city. His son was Kokalla, who was enthroned by his ministers. His son Ging yedéva is stated to have restored Kuntala to its people. After his death at Prayāga with his 100 wives his son Karnadeva succeeded hini. Ho erected a golden templo at Kasi called Karnamēru and founded the city of Karnăvati. Karna is recorded to have abdicated the throne in favour of his son Yasahkarnadáva, hiinself taking part in his coronation. Yaral karpadeva is said to have rivalled Parasurama in destroying his enemies. He defeated

the Andhra king and worshipped Bhimośvara near the Godavari. So far there is nothing now in the rocord, as the information exactly corresponds to what is given in the Jabalpur plate of the same king.1 
What is most important in this rocord is the dato, which evidently refers to the Kalacbari ers, though it is not expressly stated. It is unfortunate that the details do not work out corrootly. Having failed to reconcile the lunar day with that of the solar Sankranti, working with the aid of Mr. Sewell's Indian Calendar, I referred the matter to the author himself. Mr. Sowell very kindly made calculations for me, but found the results unsatisfactory. Ho informed me that the 14th of the bright fortnight of Phālgana of the Kalachuri year 823 current foll on the 6th Maroh 1072 A.D., but the week day was Tuesday instead of a Sunday, and there was no Sankranti on that date. The Mina Sankranti had taken place on the 22nd February of that year on a Wednosday, that is 13 days oarlior. He also tried the previous Fear. In that year Phálgana Sukla 14 fell on Wodnesday, February 16th, A.D. 1071, but the Mina Sankranti was on Monday, February 21st. The expired year 823 however gave a Sunday for Phälguna Sukla 14 (24th February 1073 A.D.), but tho Mina Sankranti in that year took place on Thursday, February 21st. Taking chaturdast as a possible mistake for chaturthi the details for the current year 823 gavo the equivalont as Sunday, the 26th February, 1072 
.D., bat here again the Sankrūnti did not ocour on that day. This naturally suggests that tho record may be a forgery, but there are no indications of its being so othorwise. The style of the characters, which is the chief test in such matters, is exactly that of the Jabalpur plato of tho samo king and is quite in keeping with other records of the Kalachari kings. It appears to me that the yuar given in this rooord most rofor to the expired year 823, in which year we find the lunar day to agree with the date. Dr. Kielhoru in Festgruss an Rudolf von Roth hus showa that in the Kalaohuri records the years referred to were expired years and not current ones. Thus the only difficulty that remains to be solved in the Sankranti day, and the only conjectura* I can make on this point is that the record was possibly dated on tho day on which it was actually handed ovor to tho donoe, though tho grant was made on tho auspicious Sankrinti day, on which the donor probably bathed at the source of the Narmada at Amarokantaka, one of the boliost placea in the Tripuri kingdom, und mado the useal sannkalpa. This is suggosted by the vicinity of Khairhā to Amara kaptaka, whence it is within 40 miles.

% I am indebted to the Revd. C. C. Lerrmann, Ph.D., Principal of the Thoborn Biblical Institute, Jabalpur, for kindly translating for my uso, from Gerinan into English, Dr. Kiolborn's article on “ Dio Epoche der Codi-Aera." 
& A case of a similar nature which lends support to this conjecture is found in the Benäres plate of Karpulöva (Kp. Ind., Vol. II, p. 297 f.) which is dated, at the end, on Monday vadi 9 of Phälguna in the year 798, while in the 40th line the fraddha coremony, which was the occasion for making the grant, is stated to have been performed on Saturday Fiuli 2 of the samo month. That show that the record wat ready for delivery about a wook after tho sankalpa for the grant was made. By the way I may ada that the supposition of Dr. Kiebóra (ibidem, p. 300) that the grant was made a month before and that Philguna was a mistake for Mäghy, because it is else impossible to reconcile tho week day with the dvitiya, appears to me unwarranted. Dr. Kjelhorn believed that the fräddha ooremony was actually performed on a Saturday, while the doitiya of Phalguna in 793 fell on a Sunday and not on a Saturday. The second lithi of the dark fortnight of Migha, on the other hand fell on a Saturday. I agree with him in this respect but I do not see why the month should be considered a mistako and pot rather the day. My own idea is that Karpu's father died on a dvitiya and hence the fräddha must be performed on that date, but as in the year 793 it fell on a Sunday, which is not an auspicious day for such ceremonior, it was performed a day before, and while doitiya, the anniversary day, could not be altored it bad.to be associated with the wook day on which the ceremonies actually took place. This is in accordance with the present-day practice in the Jabalpur District, whore Karna ruled.,

KHAIRAA PLATES OF YASAHKARNADEVA. 
207 
That Yasahkarnadēva was wont to make gifts on Sankranti days would appear from his Jabalpur plate record, in which it is stated that the grant was inade on the occasion of the Makara Sankrantiil Here the date according to the Kagpar Museum transcript of the lost plate ia "Monday, tho 10th of the dark fortnight of Māgha 829 at the time of the Uttarayana Sankranti." In this case too the details work ont for Monday, the 31st December A.D. 1078 for the expired Kalachuri year 829, but the Makara Sankranti had taken place a week earlier, vir, on Monday, Dooomber 24th. As will be shown further on, this appears to be a more probablo date for the Jabalpur plato than the one worked out by Dr. Kielhorn, who was anaware of tho date contained in the transoript, and who only tried to make the wook day fit in with the day of the Lupar month and tho Sankranti. 
But whatover the difforon oes between the day and the date, I think there is no mistake in the your of tho Khairhā inscription, and tho new information that wo gather from this rocord is accordingly that in 1073 AD, king Karna had ceased to reigo and that his bon Yarahkarpa had come to the throne. If we woro to assume the date of the Jabalpur plato to be 1122 A.D. as caloulated by Dr. Kielhorn, this would give an unusually long reign to Yasahkarna, even if we consider the faot that Karna had abdicated the throne in favour of Yasah karna and that thus the latter may he expected to havo had a longer reign than others. Our record slows that Yasah.karna had defeated the king of Andhra and crushed the power of soveral of his onemies bofore it was writton. It is thoroforo very likoly that hu liad been in occupntion of the throno for at least for 5 years prior to this, and if we suppose that ho lived for about the anne period aftor he mado the Jabalpur grant, his reign would oxtond to abont 60 years and his age to about 80 years, supposing his installation to havo taken place at the age of 20. To a boy of learer age a great king like Kar & would not havo entrasted the government of his kingdom, however law-abiding son bo may have beon. 
Tho new dating of the Jabalpur plate seems to contradict the theory that during Yasah. karpa's reign part of the Chodi dominion had passod into tho possession of the Kanauj kings. That theory is based on an inscription of Govindachandrndēva, who in the Vikrama ycar 1177 (A.D. 1120) sanctionod the transfer of some land which had originally boen granted by Yasah karvadova. There is nothing in the inscription to show that the trans same yoar in which the district wherein the transforred land was situated passed into the hands of Govindachandra. In fact the context appears to show that it was otherwiso. The district may well have been taken by the Kanauj king in the reign of Yaśuḥkarna's successor, who would certainly have refrained from confiscating his father's gift, and to the original donos it moat have remained a gift of Yaśaḥkarna for all times. 
There is a somewhat vaguo reference to two important historical ovonts in vorsos ll and 23. If I have correotly interpreted verse ll, there is an allusion to the conquest and restoration of the Kuntale country to its king by Gāögöyadova. This kingdom incladod tho Baliavābi, Hangal, Puligere, Bufpola, Kündi, Belgaum, Kisukad districts, eto., in the Hyderābād Stato and the Bombay Presidency and seems to bave been tho raiding ground of tho poighbouring kings in the same way as the old Chakrakotya in Bostar. The Chalukya king Tailapas olaims to have subjugated it about 973 A.D., Kulottunga-Choladova? I. is recorded to have refontod the Kantala king about 1070 A.D., and a century later Ballāla 11.8 of the Hoseala dynasty established his appremacy ovor that country.

It appears that after Tailapa's raid Kuntala was raided by Gábgoyadáva. This must bare been done before 1049 A.D., as at that time Gängeya bad ceased to reign. The subjugation of a kingdom so far away from Tripart indicates the greatness of its viotors at that time. It is such bold enterprises which seem to have prepared the way to the conquest of Telangåna by Gangiya's son Karpadova, who assumed the title of Trikulingadhipati or Lord of Trikalinga. That this remoto country did not accept the Tripuri yoke submissively, is apparent from verhe 23, in which great Karna's son Yaśaḥkarna is stated to have extirpated the ruler pf Andhra and to have worshipped the latter's own God Bhimēóvara near the Godávart with presenta appar. 
oted from his enemy's treasuries. This confiot appears to have takon place in the presont Godavari district, where the sacred shrines of Bhimośvara are to be found. The principal one is that of Drūkshårimam in the Rūmchandrapuram Taluka. The Godavári District Gazettoer (1907)1 gives the following information about it. "The real centre of the religious interost of Dräkshärāmam is tho temple of Bhimdávaranvāmi. It contains a parti cularly big lingar some fourteen or fifteen feet high. This is supposed to be a part of tho lingam which broke into five pioces and fell at five holy places, vis. at Bhimavaram or Bhimărima in Cocanada, Palakollu or Kshirrima in Kistna, Amaravati or Amarürüma in the Gautur District, and Kumardráma, which is not identified. It is supposed to bave been orected by tho won and worshippod by the boven anges who made the seven mouths of the Godāvari. So it is sufficiently holy. The soven sages are supposed to have each brought water from their respective rivors underground to the tank at Dräksbäriman which is called the sapla Gödārart, seven Godavaria. Thoro is a sacred bathing ghit in this tank which con fers in a condonbcd form all the sanctity which is to bo obtained by separate baths in each of tho sovon rivors. Liko many other holy places in this and other districts, the town is called tho southeru Bonāros. It is sopposed to havo been founded by the sage Vyāsa and a rdvi tree and a lingan planted by him aro still shown. So great is its sanotity that a night's halt in it is believed by some to reniler future births urinecessary . . The tomple is A rather lardsomo two-storeyed building. Its ereotion is ascribed by popular tradition to an unknown Chola king. In the porch round the shrine in the upper storey are black granite Chölnkyan pillars, a great rarity in this district , , . . It contains a great number of ancient inscriptions . . . . The earliest appears to be . . . dated in A.D. 1055, or during the reign of the Rājaraja whose capital was at Rajahmundry." 
Irom this description, I feel little hositation in identifying the Bhimēdvars whom Yaśabkarna worshipped with the Bhimosvaru of Drāksbärāmam. The temple was in existence in tho times of Yaśaḥ karna, as its inscriptions show. It was one of the holiest places in the Andhra Cuntry and well worthy of a royal visit. It may perhaps bo urged against this that the contoxt scoins to obuw that the god was enshrined on tho bank of the Godávari, as the latter is deveribod in verse 23 as abhyarnna-gata, but Drákshārāmam is about 14 miles away from tho river. In my opinion abhyurnna does not necessarily iudicato such a close proximity us to require the situation of the temple on the bank of the Godávari. A distance of 14 miles is # ncgligible item in the doscription by ono living hundreds of miles away from the locality. I think in the words srõtahsvaraih saptabhih of verso 23, there is certainly an allusion to the traditional seven streams or mouths of the Godivari, said to havo been mado by the seven great rishis and considered very holy. Even if it be held that the context refers to the sapta Godavari tank at Dräkshårimam, it does not affect the conclusion that it was in that holy place that Yasaḥkarpa paid his thanksgiving on gaining & victory over the Aodhra king, who

may have been either Rajarāja (1022-62) or more probably his brother and successor, Vijayaditya VII., who occupied tho Vongi throne with some interruption till 1077 A.D. It was the latter's rule whioh was disturbed by outside invasion, the Chalukya Vikramaditya VI, having attacked him twice. In one of the South Indian inscriptions Vijayaditya is de aoribed as a warrior whose broad hands held weapons of war' and the same thing is perhaps alladed to in nur inscription where in verbe 23 tho play of arms of the rulor of tho Andhra's' is spoken of as disclosing no faw.' The dates of Vijayiditya and Yaśaḥkarna 6t in so well that thore seems little doubt that the former was the Andhra king referred to. 
With regard to geographical names occurring in tho record Tripuri is the woll-known Tewar 8 miles from Jabalpur, in the middle of which thero is still a Siva linya going under the name of Tripurēšvara or the lord of Tripura or Tripuri. Karşāvati (v. 1-6) has now been wiped out of existenco. It was about a mile from Tripuri and the site is still known as Karanbile & name with double signification, retaining the memory of the founder in the first balf and giving the distinguishing mark of the site in the second half, thore being a junglo of vēl trecs planted to supply leaves to tho numerous Sivu lingas ouco enshrined the ro. Tho Kuntala and Andhra countries have been referred to refore. Prayāga and Kāśi, the Godavari and Kalinga are too well known to require any description. With regard to the villugo Doulā Pamobola and to Dēvagrame, pattala in which it was situated, I am indebted to Rai Bahadur Pandit Jánaki Prasad, Secretary to His Highness tho Mahăräja of R enquiry in the Rowah State, from which it appears that close to Kbairhů thero aro 2 villages named Deogayān and Deogain, the formor being a corruption of Dovagrima and the latter a diminutive of tho samo, where there are a number of vory old wells und wator reservoirs together with remains of old buildings. I am therefore inclined to think that Drogavin, close to the village Arjbula, with which it appears to have been amalgamatod but again scparated by the Settlement Department of the State, roprosents the head quarters of tho pattulie (il parqund like sub-division) Dövagrama. Its great oxtent is indicated by the division of the old town into two villagos, Doogavān and Döogaio, the bigger portion boing given a masculino and the smaller a foininino Dame, like husband and wife, thongh two yet one. Doula Paincholu, for which we should now expect some such forın'as Diorů, is not traceable in the vicinity of Khairbi or Doogavån, though there are several villages of that namu in tho adjoining district of Jabalpur. 'There are no materials available to show the extent of a pattala in oldou times, but if it inoluded large areas, one of the Dcords of the Murwårå tahsil in the north-onst corner adjoining the Bagbelkhand border may bo identified with the village granted in this rocord. The meaning of tho word Panchala added to it, would then be significant. l'amchala was tho tract of country to the east of the East Indian Railway line from Sihori in the middle of the Jabalpur district, to its northern border, the whole of which abuts on Baghölkhand. Sir William Sleeman ini montioning the 52 garhs of the Gond king Sangrăm Shah, says that Pachölgarh was the country lying between the rivers Burma (Bearma) and Mabinadi (chhöļi) or tho Pargana of Kombeu (Kombbi) whioh corresponds to the tract referred to above. 
À word with regard to the third portion of this record, which contains an unusually large pumber of benedictive and imprecatory quotations. Mr. Pargitor remarks that it was a common practice in making grants of land in Anciont India for the donor to empbasize the gift: and endeavour to seouro ite permanence by ingerting in the deed of the grant one or moro versos wbich were considered as sacred regulations regarding gifts of land.

In our record there aro no loss than 16 verses of this clase, but this mothod of guaranteeing tho enjoyment of the grant by the granted was not only confined to India bat is spread over a wide territory and is found even in the documents of grants made by the early Anglo-Saxon kings. My attention was first drawn to this by Mr.C. E.

TRANSLATION 
OM! Om ! salutation to Brabmi 
(Verse 1.) Glorious is the god) whose navel is a lotus (i.e. Vishinn), glorious is the lotus which is bis pavel (and) glorious is (the god) born from that lotus (i.s. Brahma). Glorious also is his offspring Atri, and glorious ia the friend of the ocean who took his birth from Atri's eye (., the moon). 
(V. 2.) Now the king who is tho swan in the lake of the expanse of heaven (ie, the moon) begat as his offspring Bodhana, the son of (that) primeval king (rīja 4.e. inoon) (and) son-in law in the horso of the friond of lotones (i.e. the nun). 
(V. 3.) This son of the god who is the olixir producod from the seven seas obtained, as the son of his own body, Purtravas, who had both Urvast and the oarth horo for his faithful wives to be enjoyed by him with thoir hundreds of uprivalled blessings. 
(V.4.) In this family forsooth was horn Bharatn, whose pure fame is proclaimed by the Yamană, hemmed in by moro than hundred posts of horse sacrifices (offorol by him), Bharata, who delighted in the welfare of the earth, made lovely, by the ornament, the jewelled girile of the seven scås. 
. (V. 5.) Highly glorious is in his family that Kārtapirya who, though he had no need of them, wielded with ease every woapon, (and) who allowed the title of king (rāja) only to the Moon, the ancestor of the family of thicso Haihaya princes. 
(V. 6.) Resembling the Himalaya, tbe lord of mountains, that lord of princes begat the Kalachuri race, which is purifiod by rulors of spotlcas conduct, as (tho rannsu, bamboo) with pare round.pearls. 
(V. 7.) In this family was a prince, foremost of the prudent, who purifiod the town of Tri. 
As like Indra's City-Yuvarājadēva, who destroyed the lords of princes blind. od by passion, as a young lion does powerful infuriatod elephants. 
(V. 8.) The chief ministers of that ruler of tho carth placed on the throne his son Kökalla, & lion-like prince, the progress of whose armies, consisting of four parts (viz. elephants, chariots, horsemen and soldiers on foot), was chocked (only) by their encounteriog the masses of waves of the four oceans. 
(V.9.) That lord having gone far away, his famo shows liko a forsakon woman; deriding white sandal, it reproves the lustre of the moon, and is a reproach to a string of pearls. 
(V. 10.) Bis son was Gāngāyadēva, a thunderbolt falling on tho heads of onemies (and) the lord of the fortuno of heroes, with a cheat broad liko an emerald tublet, (and) with smiling eyes, (and) with bis two arms surpassing the longth of a city bar. 
(V.11.) The crest jewel of crowned beads, he becamo fumoua under the namo of Vikrami. ditya, wisbing to run away from whom with dishovelled hair (the king of Kuntala) who was deprived of his country came to possess it again. 
(V. 12.) When, fond of residing at the foot of tho holy fig tree of Prayaga, ho had juana salvation there together with his hundred wives, his son Karpadēva honoured the quartors with the pearls from the frontal globes of the majestic elophants of his enemies, cleft by his Aword. 
In the first 24 vernas I have adopted Dr. Kielborn's excellent translation of the Jabalpur plate, with snch alterations as the clearer and better readings of this inscription have necesitated. 
The morning of the socond line of this verse is very obscure. The writer evidently plays on the word Kuntal, and has brought about what is onlled virodhäbkása whon he saya akuntalah kuntalatan babkāra, i... hairlous person bore bairinon (au apparent contradiction). The eulogist evidently noems to convey that Gingöyadora WH a noble tbat be restored the Kuntale country to ita king who wu defeated and wall running away with dlobovelled bair (a second pun on the word akuntala).

(V. 13.) Of him whose fame is like the circlo of waves of the milky ocean, nood we say more than that here at Käsi there is a tannple (erected by him), Kårpamora, (ao lofty) that the wind of the fags which wave from its golden spiros lessons the fatigue of the damsels of hes ven, when playing in the sky. 
(V. 11.) He set up the pillar of piety, called Karnăvati, the foremost abode of bliss, the root of the creeping plant--knowledge of the Vodas, the diadem of the stream of heaven, the world of Brabman on the surface of the earth. 
(V. 15.) That lord of the Kalacharis begat on the illustrious Āvalladēvi, (another) goddess of fortune produced from the ocean of the Hüņa family, the illustrious Yagahkarpadēva, the glory of whose fame is co-oxtonvive with the billows of the milky ocean whiob rose (whon he grose), mistuking him to be the rising moon. 
(V.16.) Of this law-abiding (Hon) the father, whose acts were purifiod by the respect which he paid to tho family priests, performed himself the great inauguration ceremony in the midst of the four great ocoans, mado resplendent, as by a full jar, by the king of nountains, and illu mined by the moon and the sun. 
(V. 17.) Glorious is that jewel lamp of Jambudvipa which aonds forth its rays in the dark ness of uight of tho Kali age, nover fillod with partiality to wicked poople (as an ordinary lamp is filled with tho fallen wings of night moths (and) never emitting the lampblack, base conduct. 
(V. 18.) If the milk of the cow of plenty were (put) within the two oystor sholle trimmed with the goms which grant overy desire, then thero would be seen a likeness with the eyes of tbat bountiful (king) whoso eyes aro both wbite aod rod. 
(V. 19.) Ho erected high pillars of victory near the onds of the earth, as companions of tho poets to which the elophants of the quarters are fastenod. 
(V. 20.) This bountiful (lord) puts five or six drops of wator into the hands of the Brāhmans and they with theso already quonch their thirst and afterwards show their contempt oren for the mino of precious stones (ie. the ocean). 
(V. 21.) In weight (liko the mountain) Moru, this ruler of the earth exceedingly gratifies sappliants by bestowing on them (gold) equal to his own weight and by other great gifts. 
. (V. 22.) Bright like the tusks of the elephant of the king of heaven, pare like the shella of the ocown of milk, (and) lastrons like tho skin of the snake which is tbe coach of Vishnu, his fame has become saper-abundant. 
(V. 23.)

** By B. C. Mazumdar, M.B.A.S. This charter was unearthed in the year 1890 at & place not far from the village Mabadā in tho Feudatory State of Soupar. Tho name of the village Mabada ocours in the text of the grant. The Mahārāja of Soupur, B. M. Sing Deo Bahadur, has been good enough t band the platos over to me for publication. 
There are altogether three plates, of which the first has only been inscribed on the roverse. The height of the plates is 38", and the length of the first plate 87" and of the second and third 9". There is at the upper edgo, about the middle of the side, a sinall circulah ring holo, through which a plain copper ring was passed, the onds of which had been loft unsold oud. The digitale of the plates including the ring is 63 tolas. 
Tho characters in the main agroo with, or strongly resemble, the modern Bengali tatter The lotters ka, ha, pa and ya resornblo those old letters which have been retained in modern Nāgari, while letters such ag sa (0.g. 1. 7), tya (1. 8) and tha in stha (1. 12) strongly remind of Modern Origā characters. Orthographical mistakes such 88 -sudua-for-gabda- (1.1); -singha-for-rimha(1. 4) aro such as aro characteriatic of modern Oriyā writors. We also And the modoro Oriya pronunciation of ri as ru in -rugvéda- (1. 18). This pronunciation com menoed to provail from the time of the infuence of the Ganga-Rājās in Orissa. 
The grantor is Sri Yögāśvara Dēvavarman (1. 24), grandson of somāšvara. Déva varman, and the son of Sri Dhárana (or Várapa) Dévavarmanl (ll. 15, 16 and 17). Ho is said to have boon the ruler of Baudh* (1.5), and his ancestor is said to have come from Ayodhya, - Boion of the Solar dynasty (lives 2 and 3) belonging to the Kāáyapa-gotra. Two emblema have bcon claimcd by the grantor for his family--one, & lion on the banner (1.4), and the other a drija rūja (1.6). It has been mentioned (1.1) thut the kings of this family bad attninod the pañchamahasabdas. This designation marks thena as fendatories. The grantor is said to have also the titlo gaja (line 33), though virtually ho was a lion (1. 34). It may be noted that Gajapati bus long been the title of the Rājās of Puri and Khorda. 
The grantoo is į Brāhmaṇa Madhushdana (1. 17) of the Vatsa-gotra, a hotri, and a student of the Rigveda with the Brāhmanas (1. 18). The names of his father and grandfather weru Purushottama and Gadādhara (lines 14 and 15), respectively. All these names are very generally given to men at the present day in Orissa. 
Of tho six villages granted, the principal village is Champimalla, identified by me with Champā-māl iu Sonpur. Of tho 5 villages (Pañchapallik) grantod along with Champāmalla, Mahadā and Médhå (modern namos) could onls be identifod. The grant was made to secure the good will or graco of the god Vaidyanātha (1. 23), on whose lotus-like feet the grantor has been described to be a beo (1.9). There is only one temple in the State of Sonpur whiob is dedicated to Vaidyanatha. This is the finest tomple that oxiats in Sonpur. The local tradition is, that Räjá Anangabhima-Diva of Puri built it. The grant was made on the bank of the river Mahānadi callod Chitrötpală in this record. The name Chitrotpala for Mabānadı is widely and popularly known; and Rājā Sir Sudhal Deo, the late Foudatory Chief of Būmrā, gave the

title Ohitrötpala to his poem describing the Mahānadi, which was composed and published years aco. In the bed of the Mabānadı (within a stone's throw from the palace of the present Mahā. raja of Sonpur) there is a hillook called Lankokvari bearing an inscription in letters losembling those engraved on the plates of the Somavarnsi-Guptas. I could not docipher this insoription, He tho letters have become faint and illogiblo by being constantly wasbed by the river. I iden. tify this Lankesvari as the Lankávarttaka of this record (1. 13). 
A word regarding the probable dato of this record. It need hardly be pointed out that the Alates of Yorosvara Davavarman are later than those of the Somavausi-Gajtas who flourished hatween 1000 and 1100 A.D. As the present rulers of Sonpur have been ruling the state in an anbroken continuity from the time of the first roler Mahārāja Madangopāl2 from about 1916 tha Dāvavmans must bave flourished previous to the 17th century. Wo get it in the Ronal tradition that the Stato of Sonpnr WAN acquired by Madangopāl, when the Rājās of Part 
in die 
moowor and the now Rājās of Band held tho State of Sonpar ander them. We know me from about 1565 A.D., the Puri Rājās declined in power, and shortly after that date Mnkooda Doya died. It was nearly 40 years after this timo that tho presont rulers of Sonpur agamired the state. The present rulers of Baud aro of tho Käsyapı-gotra, claim descont from the Solar dynasty and have got a peacock as the family emblem. But on reforence to the genealogical troo of the Band family (kindly supplied to me by Mr. J. Rão, Dewan of the State the names of tho rulers mentioned in this record are not met with. 
I do not think that the present rulors of Band are descendants of Somrsvara, for if it had been so, tho genealogical tree would not havo omitted the names of Somośvart, his son and grandson. On referenco to tho list of nanies of the rulers of Band, it doos not appear to be likely that the prosent Raj family commenced to rale Baud moro than two decades beforo the date of Madangopāl of Sonpar. It is probable that the ancestor of tho presont rulers of Band usarped the territory previously held by throo rulers in succession, from Somośvara to Yogasyam. I sball not be far wrong, if I mako Yogēsvara Děvavarman a contemporary of Mukunda Diva of Parl. First, the facts I have set forth do not stand against the possibility of what I have nog. posted. Socondly, the second vorso in tho Indravajrā metre (ll. 33 to 35) resold, I puspoct, by wony of a pun to Mukunda Dáva. 
It is there stated (lines 33 to 35) that Mukunda (Vishna) having ontrusted the govorn. ment to tho grantor, was sleeping in the ocean with a light heart. We know that the Rajās of Puri extended their infuenco so far as Sonpur; we cannot also dismiss the local tradition, that the temple of Vaidyanātha was built by Anangabhima Döra. That the Rājās of Puri lost their domiuion to the west and to the south after the death of Mukunda Döva, is also very well known. There was no nocessity of montioning it in tho oharter that the grantor got the kingdom to rulo from god Mukunda, if he was not really undor an overlord. Of many damn of Vishậu the Dame Mukunda was selected perhaps to refer to the Rājā who will really the overlord of Yogos vara Doyavarman. 
The grant is dated in the 83rd year of the glorious reign of the grantor's grandfathor, Homěsvara-Dova, on the 7th day of the bright fortpight of Māgha, while the sun was in Makara and the moon in Mina, in the Rēvati-yāga. [Mr. Sewell has been good enough to calonlate which dates in the course of the 16th century wonld fulfil all these requirements. There are three of them, vás. Sunday, 9th January 1508, Sunday, 10th January 1535, and Sunday, 11th January 1562. Only the last one can be meant if thore is an allusion to Mukanda Döva in l. 35.-S. K.)

No. 26.-RATAUL PLATI OF CHAHADADEVA. 
By Daya Ram Sauni, M.A. 
The fragmentary copper-plate which is discilased in this noto was acquirod for the Direc tor-General of Archæology in 1911 by Mr. J. R. Pearson, I.C.S., District Officer of Meerut. The circumstances which led to its discovery were described in a forwarding note. It is atated that this inscribud fragment belonged to a copper-plate which was found, sono thirty years ago, by a resident of tho village of Rataul, Tahsil Baghpat, District Meernt, while he was osvavat ing & piece of land belonging to him in order to dig out old bricks. The plate, which is said to bave been imbedded in a domical structure nine or ten feet bolow the surface, was broken to pieces by the diggers and all the other fragmonts are said to have been lost. This is much to be regretted, for, as it will appear from the soquel, the indoription incisod on the plate was of considerable interest. 
The surviving fragment is deposited in tho Museum of Archmology at Delhi, and moastros 101" in width at the top by 39" in height. It is completo only on the upper side, but a rough estimate of the total breadth of the fragment may be formed with the help of the missing portions of the verses that remain, It is impossiblo, howevor, to find out tho ontire height or the total number of lines as it is not known what portion of the plate is broken off at the bottom. 
The extant portion of the doon mont consists of parts of six lines. Of the seventh line the top bars of some letters and superBoript yowol strokos of three syllables romain. The in scription is engraved in the Nagari characters of the beginning of tho 13th contury A.D. The height of the letters in tho first line varies from the excluding the vowel-marks to the with them, and from it to 1" in the remaiuing five lines. 
In respect of orthography we obseryo that the words have been spelt with accuracy thronghout with tho excoption of the omission of the anusnīra beforo dur in kulaikėıurz, in line 3 and the substitution of śā for sc in -stītkpita in line 2. No distinction has been mado botwaon the lottora v and b. It is noteworthy that the rules of sanhi have been nowhoro disregarded. The doubling of chh in achchhöttur (lino 2) and of n in svasmiin=alünito (line ), etc., show that the author and the scribo .were well versed in grammar. The consonants bofore and after y have beon doubled in some casos and left unaltered in others, in accordanco with the optional character of the rule ooncerned. The avagraha is not indicated. 
The language of the inscription, as far as it goes, is metrical Sanskrit with the exception of the first line. The remaining five lines contain portions of six versos wbioh werd numbered. The first perse, which is in the Årgå motre, covers the entire extant portion of line 2. Of ita

first foot (pada) ten matras out of twelve survive, so that the loss on the left sido ia two matras or onu long or two short syllables. 'It may also be aggamed that the inscription opened with & short benedictory formula. The last foot of the verse wants four or seven mätrds according as tho metre employed was årgå or Giti. The second verse terminates in line 3 and has lost the first thirteen syllables of the first half. Tbis and the boxt two verses are in the Sloka metre. The fourth verso prosumably onded in line to The next or fifth verse, which terminates in line 6, is in the Sārdūlavikridita metre. The portions which remain include the last five syllables of the örst foot, the whole of the second quarter and the last thirteen syllables of the last. Of the last verde the first five syllablos only remain. 
The object of the doonipunt was presumably to record a gift of land to one or more Brāhmaṇas. This may be inforrod, in tho absunce of the grant portion, from the first verse which affirms that tho grantor and the grantes earn an everlasting bliss, whereas the land bestowed upon a Brühmapa becomes a danger to him who appropriates it. That the donor was the chief boir-apparent, the illustrious Chühaqadēva, whose name is engravod in large charao ters in the top lino, needs no domonstration. The remainder of the insuription contains a part of the genealogy of Chāhadaděva. Versos 2 and 3 oulogise a ruler whose name is missing. He is described as the sole moon of the Chāhamana race' and the lord of the land of. Šakara bbari. Verse a records that aftor that rulor Arņņörāja • bore the burden of the world. The first half of the Gfth vorse praises # son of Arạporája who is described us 'having focussed in his own abode the prosperity of the quarters after he had conquered it. We meet with no other proper name until we come to verae 6, where we find the namo of Pfithviraja. 
We proceed to fill up the gaps in the above account. The name botwoen Arạporāja and Prithvirája is readily ascertained from a short inscription on a pillar of an ancient building at Madanpur which records the conquest of Bandelkhand by Prithviraja, the son of Somášvara and grandeon of Aranorāja in Vikrama Samvat 1239,It is obvious that the Prithviraja of our inscription is tho great Chabamāna prince of Delhi and Ajmer. The name of Arpyöräja's predecessor was Jaider uccording to the transcript published by Kari Raj Shyāmal Das of Mewar of the important rook inscription at Bijholi.3 This transcript is faulty in many rea pects and it was, no doubt, for this reason that the late Prof. Kielhorn preferred to publish an imperfect dynastia list of the Chāhamānas in his Synchronistio table for Northern India. I understand that Mr. Bhandarkar is intending to re-edit the inscription. In the meantime we are fortunate in having another valuablo rovord to refer to. I mean the important historical munuscript poom entitled the Prithiviräja-vijaya written by a Kashmir Pandit and now pre served in the Deocan College at Poong. Mr. James Morisons has provod the authenticity of this work both from intornal evidence and from that of inscriptions. This poom, which contains a contemporary narrative of Prithiviräja's caroor, begins with a complete genoalogical account of his rnce. According to this, Aronorāja's father was Ajayaraja. We now see that wbat Kari Raj Shyamal Dūs's Pandit read as Jaidov in the Bijboli inscription must in reality be Ajayudöva, an ordinary variant of Ajayaraja. 
We now come to Chãhadadova himself who issued the copper-plate. The last extant verso of our inscription begins with the genitive singular of Prithvirāja,' which might anggest that a son of this ruler was mentioned in this vorso. This sooms plausible in view of the faot that 
i in mediuval granto the aign.manual of the gruating ruler is often carved at the top or bottom of the doouinont.

Hagan Nizami in his Taju-l-Madsir states that Prithviraja had a very able son who, after his father's excoutien, was appointed to the governmont of Ajmer, The Hammira-Mahākavya, which according to Kirtane contains a historio narrative from Prithvirājs to Hammira, makes Hariraja the successor of Prithvirūja at Ajmer, though it is not apparent how he was rolated to him. In the dynastio table extraotod from the Prithiviraja-vijava by Mr. Morisod, Harir appears as the younger brother of Prithvirāja. No son of the latter seems to be recorded in this poem. 
We see from what has beon said above that the surviving portion of the indoription sap plies no clue as to the place of Chāhadadova in the Cbāhamina podigreo. Nor do the San. skrit poems referred to in the preceding paragraph mention bis namo. It is true that in the . genoalogical tree of the Chabannána tribe published by Tod, Chabadadova (spelt Chahirdeo) is shown as the younger brother of Prithvirija. But as Tod's account of the Chāhamions is based on the Prithviraja Rāsā which has beon proved to be a forgery,' we cannot accept this information as correct unless it is supported by some moro roliable sourou. For the preseirt, the question must remain an open one. 
Thero is ono thing, however, about this prince which geoms to be fairly certain, namely, that he is in all probability the name as the rulor of that namo who flourished at Narwar (anciont Nalapura) in Gwalior State in the first half of the 13th century A.D. Wo shall oxamine the evidence in tho following paragraphs. 
Goneral Cunningham has shown from an inscription discovered by him in the anciunt fort of Narwar that the rulers of that place included a lino of five chiefs the last of whom, Gapapati, was roigning in 1298 A.D. (Vikramg Samyat 1355), The genealogy of this family opens with Chahadadēva, whose coins bear datos Vikrama Samvat 1295 to 1311 (A.D. 1255). There is, howevor, an earlier ruler named Malayavarmadēva whoso name figures in numis matic works under the Narwar family. His coins bear dates Sanavat 1280, 1283 and 1290 and have beon found at Narwar, Gwalior and Jhansi. Gen. Cunning bam was of opinion that Malayavarmadova was & roler of Narwar but that he belonged to a difforout dynasty and Was ejected from Narwar, by Chåhudadova who was consequently tho founder of the above moutionod family of Narwar, 
Now, as the Chāhamina Chahadadēva of the inscription andor roviow flourished just about this time, if we are to judge from the type of charactors used in it, I am inclined to think thnt the founder of the Narwar family was no other than his namesake of the Chåbamāna tribo. When precisely Chahadadēva or his family migrated to Narwar, cannot yet be determined. It may have bappened after the downfall of Prithviraja whon his followers obca pod from Delhi and Ajmor in largo numbers. The Mabammadan historians tell us very little about this period. But we learn from tho Ilammira-Mahāktīvya that not long after the dofeat of Prithvia råja the Chåbamånas Wore turned out of Ajmer, when they retired to Ranathambhor, whioh continued in their possession until Hammira-data was plain end the town captured by Alūn-d dia in 1299 A.D.7 It is surprising that the Hanmira-Mahākāvya, as it oxists, docs pot

mention the name of Chahadadeya among the chiefs of Rapathambhor. This, however, is not & serious objection. For we learn from a Mubammadan historian, named Maulana Miphâja-d dip, that in A.H. 632 (A.D. 1294) Shamba-d-din Altamgh defeated at Rapathambbor a power ful ruler of the name of Chahadadēva who austained another defeat in A. H. 649 (A.D, 1251) near Narwar at the hands of Ulūgh Khân, tbe Commander of the forces of Balban.) This scoouut niust be correct, for Minhāju-d-din informs us that he heard of Chahadadova's bravery at the battlo of Rapathambhor from the month of Nusratu-d-din Tâ-yas'ar himsolf who lod Altamsh's forces on this occasion. We may, therefore, conclude that Chahadaděva held sway ovor both Rapathambbor and Narwar where, indeed, be is said to have been born. This need not surprise us for wo learn from the Delli-Siwálik pillar inscription that at one time the Chāhamadas ruled over the entiro territory between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas. It also follows from what has been said above that Chāhadaddva must have flourished just mid-way between the fall of Prithviraja and that of Hammira. 
Another argument in favour of the identification of the Chåhamana Chahadadova of oar inscription and the Chabadadēva of Narwar is afforded by numismatic records. The coins of Chāhadadora discoverod at Narjvar, etc. are of two kinds, namely those issued by him as an independent rulor and secondly tboso struck by him as a tributary to Altamsh. The coing of both these kinds are of the bull and horsoman type Kike those of the Chāhamang rulors and, what is more, those of the first kind also bear on the revorso the legend of Asdvari. Śri-Samantadevat which only occurs on the coins of the Chibanāna Somośvara and his son Prithvirajı. 
It will be obsorved that in the inscription, Chühadadova is called & Mahakumara or chiof heir-apparont. The grant must consequeutly have been issued by him before his enthrope. ment.

Conuingham (Coins of Mediæral India, pp. 90-91) and Thomus (Pathans of Delhi, p. 87) maintained that one and the samo Vindu chief was defeated at Ranathambbör and Narmar.

No. 27.-TWO CAVE-INSCRIPTIONS AT DALAVANUR. 
BT PROFESOR E. HULTZsoa, Ps.D.; HALLE (SAALE). 
These two well-preserved inscriptions are engraved on a pillar in a rook-ont care at Dalavapür in the Tigdivagam taluka of the South Arcot district. They were first brought to notice by the lato Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya in his Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1904-05, P. 47. I edit them from inked estampagen received from Rso Sahib H. Krishna Sastri. 
The Arst inscription (A) consists of a singlo Sanskrit Sloka, each pada of whioh, as in the Mahendravidi oavo-inscription,' occupies a separato line. 
The second insoription (B) is divided in two sections, of which the first is written in Tamil verse, and the second in Tamil proso. 
The alphabet of A is Grantha of exactly the same typo as at Mahondravidi. The Tamil inscription B exhibita lebs arobaio forms and, as suggested by Mr. Venkayya, was probably engraved at a later date than a. The following Grantha letters occur in Bigri (1. l), sa (1. 7), sva (1. 8), [b]ra (1. 11), and disan (1. 13 f.). 
The inscription A statos that the onye which contains it was made on the hill at the order of a king Naröndra or Satrumalla and named after himself) Satrumollisvaralayn, i.e. 'the Távara (Siva) temple of Satrumalla. Satrumalla is known to have been a surnamo of the Pallava king Mahendravarman I., who reignod about the beginning of the seventh century, Perhaps Narondra, the Indra among then,' is a more variant of the name Mahöndra, the great Indra,' and Narendra Satrumalla has to be identified with Mahendravarnan I., whose inscriptions show the same alphabet as A. 
The first section of B states in Tamil the same fact as A, viz. that Narendra founded the Satrumallăsvarīlaya. It gives the nanie of the locality as Veņboţtu and confirms thy surmise that Naröndra belonged to the Pallava family by calling him 'the king (who woro) a beautifal garland of tondai,' and Pottaraiyan, 1.e. the Pallava king.'8 The second section of B rocords the name of the composer of the procoding Tamil stanza.

This inscription, which I edit from an inked estampage supplied by Rao Saheb Ħ, Krishna Satri, was discovered in the year 1904 at a place called Kudimiyāmalai in the Pudukkottai State, Southern India. It is written on & rock on the slopes of the hill bebind the Sikhãnätbabvāmin Tomple. Close to it on its right sido ia & rock-cut shrine called Melaikkovil, in front of which is a mandapa, constructed of cut stone. The inscription at the right end of thu 6th and 7th sections is covored by the basement of this mandapa, but it is easily soen that only the last few notos in oach sub-section (line) are lost, in addition to the words Ramaptāḥ svarāgamaḥ 
! In this stanza tondai (1. 1) some to rhymo with kandan (1.5 f.). 
* Mr. S. Krishnaswami Aiyongar, whom I consulted on this paggage, divides tondaiyandār into tond ai of am + für and remarks as follows:-- " The garland (tar) is one of the usual insignia of the kingly office. Sometimes the porsonal noun târān is ilged for 'H king.' " Tondai or adondai is the name of a creoper (Capparis horrida) wlrich, as tradition asserts, furnished the matorials for his garland to the Palava or ruler of Tondai-mandalam, just to the palmyra (paņai) to the Chira, the atti (Bauhinia racemosa) to the Chola, and tho nim tree (umbu) to the Pandya. 
The syllable păl, which follows the nnon ten, is one of the many affixes of the locative case.

KUDIMIYAMALAI INSCRIPTION ON MUSIC. 
227 
L 
UNANLARUMwamTHIET 
The characters seem to belong to the 7th century. They closely resemble those of the early Chalukya period. In particular, it may be noted that the letter e, as in Pallava insorip tions of this period, is almost identical with ba. Other peculiarities to be noted are, (1) the use of a small ma below the line to indicate a final m in the first line of the heading of Section l; (2) the two dots of the visarga are sometimes joined by a lino, as in l. % of the same heading, and (3) the u-mātrā of ha in the same line is ropresented by a stroke above, and not to the right of ha. The dots above tho letters, which mark the notation, are in several cases doubtful, and in the absence of a clgo to their meaning (see below) I have only kept such as were broad and deep. 
The most anoient Sanskrit work, which treats of music, is the Bhitrattya-nālya-sistra. This treatise, as it has come down to us, shows signs of having boon handlod and re-handledt, and all ite parts are not of the same age. The chapters treating of music aro among those wbich show this re-handling to a very inarked degree, and for reasons which I have givon 
they cannot be assigned to an earlier period than thu 4th contury A.D. This work while defining different modes of music (jātis), does not give actual examples in notativo, 80 that it is imrossible for us to obtain a clear notion of the music of that period. 
The next treatise available to us is the Sanyita-ratnākara by Gărógadova, writton betweon A.D. 1210 and A.D. 1247. Though tho author of this work give examples i modes of music (jätis) defined by Bharata, he evidently does so on the authority of somo previous writer or writers, thougb he dors not name them. This is clear from tho fact that after giving such an example he adds that the musio resembles some particular kinds (riyas) existing in his own time. Ivoidentally it may be mentionod that thero osumnplos of jätis often do not agree with Bharata's definitions, so that they must be regarded as belonging to u later period. Anyhow in the Sangita-ratnakara we have, in notation, musio belonging to tho author's own period as well as that of some previous period; and ciamples of tho latter the author muat have borrowed from ourlier works available to brim. As a matter of fact many writers on music intervonod between Bharata and Särugadova, but though tho latter gives a string of their names, their treatises are unknown to us except in a few scattered quotations given by Intor authors. In sbort, at the present day'the carliest murio in potation availablo to as is that given in the Sangita-ratnākara. Unfortunately the attitudo of the author of this work is to explain away discrepancies by interpreting Ancient rules so as to make them agree with tho sotuad praotice of the day, a8 1 bave pointed out olsewhore, so that only a few of such dinite. pancies are actually noted by him. 
In these circumstances, it is easy to imagine the great value of the discovery of any noted music belonging to a period earlier than that of the Sangita-ratnakara. The Kudimiyamalai insoription supplies such music. Tho inscription is in characters of about tho 7th century A.D., s.e. abont six centuries before Särigadova, tho author of the Sangila ratnākara. It is divided into seven sections corresponding to the seven classical rüyas of the timo, viz. (1) Madhyamagrāma, (2) Shadjayrāmu, (3) Shadura, (4) Sadharita, (5) l'uñchama, (6) Katsikathadhyama, and (7) Kaifika. Each section consists of a collection of groups of four notes, arranged in sub-sections of sixtcen, each sub-rection taking up one line of the inscription. Of course, only those notes are used which are proper to the particular rāgu. Each group in & Bub-section ends in the same note. The note in which a particular rīga must bo ended is called the nyasa (final). That sub-section, which consists of groups having tho nyasa for their ending noto, is put the last in & Kection. The other sub-sectious are arranged according to the position of the onding noto in the Hindu gamut sa, ni, ya, ma, pa, dha, ne : a sub-section consisting of groups coding in sa preceding one of groups ending in ri and so ou.

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
(VOL. XIL 
The notos employed in the music of this inscription are as follows : 
sa ra g a (antara) ma pa dha na ka.(kakali) 
Tho relativo vibration-frequencies of those notes detormined from the data in the Bharatiya-natya-sastra are respectively 
Eb E In the Sangita-ratnakura those notes had the same value, but it seems that the values 
and for ga and ni respeotively had probably come into alle also, which differ from the other values only by a comma. We can, thorefore, with certainty, accept these values for the various notes in this inscription. The alternative values of ga and ni will not affect the character of the music. 
In the notation of this music two points deserve speoial notice :-(1) Each note is expressed by a combination of the initial consonant in the name of the pote with the vowela a, i, u, or e, 0.9. we have sa, si, su, ae ; ,8 ri, ru, rē, etc. Following the same rule, for the note antara, which begins with the vowel u, wo must bavo the modifications a, i, u, and ē, and for the kikali, ka, ki, ku, and ha. But in this inscription, we find a, th, and e, and ka, ku, and ko only. The i and ki are wanting. In old Hindu music the antara and the kakali received the same treatment and it is therefore to be expectod that of i and ki, if one should be excluded, the other would he excluded on identical grounds. 
I am not able to say what the different vowel endings are intonded to indicate, but any one can see that it has no affinity with the similar nomenclature invented by Govinda Dikshit at a later period. The musio in the inacription appears to be intended for tho vina, since it b88 heen given tho title chatushpraharadrarāgumah or authoritative texts of notos produced by fonr strikings (of tho string); and I think the vowel endings may indicate the particular ways of striking or plucking the string, such as are mentioned in various old works on musio, e.g. the four sārunās mentioned in the Sangita-ratnakara, p. 485. 
(2) The borond point in the rotation deserving potice is the dots on the tons of some of the notes. I cannot suggert uny explanation of this sign. I do not think, however, that it indicatos the lowest of the three octaves as it does in the potation of the Sungita-ratnakara. 
The seven rāgas in which the music is written did not exist at the time of the Bharativa. nālya-stīstra, for none of them are montioned in the chapters of that workopecially devoted to musio. That work, as has been already remarkod, has received numerous re-handlings, and what is still mora notoworthy, diany quotations said to have been derived from it cannot be found in any of the manuscripts availablo to us. Thus Kallinåtha quotes the following verses as from Bharata in his commentary on tbo Sangitu-ratnākarab: 
tatha chräha Bhuratah pürturargă tu fuddha sylīd bhinná prastäranäsraya 1 risara mukhya(kha)yõh karya garbhë gaudi vidhiyate | siddharit (ran)=āramarxhë syāt sandhau nirtuhuna (na) tatha il 
These verses are nowhere to be found in Bharata's work. Indeed Kallingtha ought to have seen that they go contrary to the loaching of that author, as he has himself noticed pro 
· Ind. ant., Vol. XLI, pp. 254 . ? The grounds for this statement will appear in a subsequent article in the Indian Antiquary. 8 The name rishabha begins with a vowol, but the consonant mis used in the case of that pote.

viously that Bharata speaks of foor gitis only, vis, the māgadni and others, which are quite different from these five. The alleged quotation proceeda further thos, 
mukha tu madhyamagramah shadjah pratimukhë tatha i garbhë sadharitaš=chxaiva hyravamarehe tu panchamah || aanhare kaišįkah proktah pūrvarang: tu shiidavan(vah) I chitrasyadadasangasya (1) tv antē kuifikamadhyamah I fuddhānām viniyogowyarh brahmana sumudahritah 11 
These verses lay down the rules as to when the seven suddha ragas are to be ugod in a nataka (drama), and these are the very seven rīgas in which the music of this inscription is written. Though those verses are quoted hy Kallinātba as from Bharatu, that work has only got the following: 
tatas cha kūvyabandlučshuu nanabhāvarumāšrayam 1 gramadvayan cha kartavyan yatha sadharanaśrayan | mukhé tu madhyamagrāmah shadjah pratimukhi bharet 1 sådhåritai tatha garbhā vimarsi ch=aiva pañchamam || kaitikai cha tathrī karyan güna[-*] nirgra(rva)anë budhaihi sarniirittäśrayan ch=uiva rasablavasamapritam | 
In the first placo let it be noted that only fivo names, likely to be understood as being those of the above montionod rägas, occur in these verses. Secondly, the manuscript A3 reads madhyaman for panchanum, which further reduces tho anmber. The manuscript A, I may remark, is on the whole more trustworthy than those on which the printed odition is based. Thirdly, it must be remembered that none of these names occur as belonging to rāgas in the special cbapters of the work troating of musio. All this at once makes one think that the names, as libed here, do not bolong to rīgas at all, and this conjecturo is borno out by the explicit statement containod in tho, firut slöka, which Kallinātha has not quoted. From this sliko it is ovident that the roles in the following vorscs are not for the age of rägas of those dames, but for the two grāmas and the sälhirana mentioned in an «arlier part of the work. Thus, music in the madhyama-yrama is to be used in the mulcha portion of a nāfaka and ngnin in rimorsa (or aramarsha), music in tho shadja-yrīma in tho pratimukha, music in the sidharana (eduhüritam is thus a mistake for sūdharanam) in tho yarbha, and music in the kaifika in tho nirrahana. 
It is thus clcar that the seven rdgas of this inscription did not exist in the time of the Bharatiya-nilya-filstra. When they come into existence is not known, the present inscription being their carliest record. They occur in the Sangitu-ratnakura, a treatiso of a much lator date (see above), and in a work called the Nāradi-siksha, the date of wbioh is not known, but which is presumably bused on a certain work of Nürada, referred to in the Saingila-ratnākura. What is more, the Siksha mentions only thieso seven rägas, whereas the Rutnakaru montions many others, thus showing that the former represents music of an carlier period, 
I shall now prococd to discuss whether the music of the inscription agrors with tho defini. tions of the reven rdgas an given in the two works. It must be remembered that out of the various modifications of these ragas given in the Batnakara, wo bave to deal with the buddha variety only, 0.g. suddha sadharita, suddha kaisika, eto. In the Siksha there is no mention of any modifications.

Siksha, howovor, this raga contains the latter note. The musio of the inscription agree with 
bar, the Siksha Bilys that in this raga the noto dhaioata is durbala (weak). wbich. is borne out by the inscription. For, there are no combinations of notes ending in dha. A weak noto is nover mado tho nyasa (final) or apanyāsa (a secondary resting note, the nyāsa being the final resting note). The final is ma (F). 
II. Shadja-grāma.--According to the R. this contains the potes antara (1) and kakali (B); but according to the Siksha it contains the regular notes gandhara (Eb) and nishāda (Bb). Tho inscription again agrues with this. But though the Siksha says that the nishāda is only 
touched « little,' we have groups of notes ending in that noto. The final is ma (F). 
III. Shädava.--According to the R. this contains the notes antara (L) and kakali (P), whereas the Siksha says it contains the nishada (Bb) and says nothing about tho other note, und wo must therefore assumo it to be the usual gandhāra (Eb). In the inscription we find the antara (B) and uishadu (Bb). We have no groups of notes ending in the antara. Nor hayo we groups of notes ending in pa and ni. The R. notices that pa is weak.' Tho final is mo (F). 
1V. Sädhärita. According to tho R. this riga contains the notes gāndhāra (Eb) and mishuda (Bb), but according to tho 8. wo onght to have antara (E) and kakali,(B). The iilscription agrees with the latter. Thoro are no groups anding in antara and kakali. The sub-section of groups ending in dha precodes the one ending in pa, for which I have no expla nation to offer. The final is ma (F). 
V. Panchama. According to the R. this contains antara (L) and kākalt (B) notes ; but according to tho S., antara (E) and nishüda (Db). The inscription agrees with the lattor, 
There aru po groups of notex ending in thu antara (E). Tho final is pa (C). 
VI. Kaibika-madhyama. According to the I. this contains gāndhira (Eb) and käkali (D) and loavos out rishabha (D) and panchama (G).1 The S. simply says that the notes are tho same as those of the Kaikika, but the final note (nyäsa) is madhyama (F). In the Kaišika , it is pañrhamit (G). The 8., in its definition of the Raisiku, only makes & spooial mention of the kakali (B), and we must therefore presume that the other notes, if they occur, must be the ordinary ones and among thom tbe gündhūra (Eb). Thựa there is an agreemont of the two works. The inscription, however, shows antara (L') and kakală (B). There aro no groups ending in these notes, Tho pote pa ((7) is altogether wanting, which agroos with wbat ibo R. anys in its dofinition of tho raga. But the pote ri (D) does occur, though according to R.'s definition it should be absent. In the āksliptika, however, given as an ample in the R., both ri (1)) and pu (G) are fonnd, though they are absent in the alapa and the karana given in that work. The final is met (I'). 
VII. Kaibika.According to tho R, this rāga contains tho kakali (B), the other notes being the usual ones. Tho . also says the samo (sve above). In the inscription, howover, we find the antara (1) instead of the gandhira (Eb). The final is pañchama (G). In group 4, 1. 33, we have animare which is a mistake, probably for a pamare, since nowhero olso in the inscrip tion does the samo note occur consecutively. 
It will thus be seen that thore are discrepancies in tho three works as to the nature of the rūgas. Even in the days of Matanga, a writer previous to Bárógadöva, the author of the 8. R., 
--r roms-- 1 Tlie äläpa anil karana given in the S. R. agree with this, but the akshiptikā does not. Further thu grała or initial noto is said to be the shadja of the tåra octave (the bigbeat of the three octaves). In the examplos it is tlio shadya of the mandra (lowest) octuve, probably a misprint. 
* In the Bhäraliya-rätya-fästra tho antara and the ka kali aro describoil as weak notes to be used under great rostrictiou, and that they can nover occur as posle. If we examine the inscription we find that this rule appara ently holds good here also (ce Section, IV, V, VI) except in Section VII. Even in this section it will be aoticod that theso notes are not the absoluto Oumle (nyāsas) vut only apanyasar (intermediate resting Dotos), the real 
final of tho ruga being the pañchama.

anch discrepancies oxisted, as can be seen from certain quotations from that author which have come down to us. But on the whole the inscription agroos more with tho Naradi-siksha than with the S. R., which must be explainod, I think, by the former work reprogonting an earlier poriod of music. Farther, the author of the S. R. consulted works on mugio from various parts of the country (see below), before writing about the musio of an older period than his own, and he made a seloction of definitions-on what principle we do not know. Tho music in the inscrip: tion, on the other hand, must have been current at the time of its composition in the district in which the inscription is found. We have seen that this music is in much bettor agrooment with the Nāradi-fiksha than with the 8. R., which was influenced by musical treatises of differ ent parts of the country (sce the introductory flokus and frequent references to the Southern Indian musio in the 8. R.). Mr. Chinnuswami Mudaliar in his Oriental Music says that the Southern Iudian Music is founded on the teachings of Nārada, whereas that of Northern India rests on the basis of Hantimat's tenchings.l Mr. Mudalinr gives no authority for his statement3B perhaps it is a tradition. If so, the bottor agreoroont of the inscription with the Náradi-sikslut, whioh we have noticed, would soon to lend colour to it, though a similar comparison with the treatise of Hanumat (which is no longer extant) is necessary before one can maku a dofinito statement. Of course, this refers to olden times. The inoro modern Indian Inusio from the 16th century onwards has boen greatly influonccd by the music of tho Arabs, in all parts of the country. 
This treatine, according to tho colophon, was composod by somo king, who was the pupil of Rudrachårya. It is impossible to say whothor this Rudrăchirya bo tho samo as Rudruga mentioned by Matanga (vide $. R., p. 82).

This document, as will appear from its detailed description, consisted originally of fuor plates engraved on gno sido only, but in the place of the second and the fourth plates--pow wisning, two plates engraved on both sides woro substitutod, and one couchain line was attempted unsuccessfully to be engraved on the reverso sitle of the plato which was originally the third plate. When this document was uncarthed by a cultivator in his field in 1908. the foar plates now cdited were found string on a cir:ular ring (supporting the scul), cut opeu at the lowor end in such a manner, that all the plates could bo taken out of the ring. The soal is rather peculiar, as it does not contain any lagund and as it is fashioned in imitation of a lotus. The inner side of the seal is hollow. The lower external ring of the seat consists of hiftoon petals, and the middlo ring contains fourteen potals. On the top aufrco thero is a mated figure with the right arm ontstrotched to tho kuce, within tho enclosuro of a blossoming creeper. Tho figuro suums to reprerent a goddlers, and, if so, she is the representation of Lakabwi. I mny state, however, that the posture indicating peaceful meditation is hardly consistent with the figuro of any goddess.

In order to describe the plates, I shall call the first one A, the plato beginning with mbischa B, the pinto boginning with janapadan (engraved on both sides) O, and the plate timallest in size D. Though B is a littlo heavier in woight and is slightly dissimilar to A at The corners, it seems to be a gonnine portion of tho original document. Though the document is not concludod on plate 1, it appears from the context that one or two scntences only were (nigrared on another, concluding plato, which is uow missing. As this plate begins with qihbischa, it is certainly in continuation of a missing plate which had thi as ithe last letter, Neither plato C nor D is its next preceding pinto. It therefore appears that the original grant consisted of four plates, the accond and the last of which are missing: 
When the original grant & first tampered with, the ring was cut open, and the plate C and another new forged plate (subsequontly removed) must have boon put in. My reasong for this snpposition are, that in the first place the plate B cannot be linked with C, and in the second place the text after sukhena prutieustaryan (plato C, l. 21) is missing. That plate D is a later carrless forgery by the son of tho grantee nainod in plate C, is perfectly cloar. 'The very words occurring on plate o have been repeated with sono variations in plate D. The name of the grantoe in plate C (11. 18, 19) is Udayakaru, son of Vidyākara, graudson of Jayakara (miswritton Vraynkari, compnro line il of plato D) and great-grandson of Lakshmidhara, while tho grantee appears in plato D as the son of Udayakara, bearing the mune Bhūbliakaru Sürman. The reasons for these chavges or forgery are not of course now apparent. 
This copper-plate grant, as it is not edited, was found buried in a field, recently bronght under cultivation, in the your 1908 in the villago of Kölgi in the Uttara-tira division of tho Houdatory State of Soupnr. The river Mahanadi flows right through the State of Sonnur, and tho portion lying to tho left or the north of the river is called tho Uttara-tira division. while the portion to the right or to the south is named Dakshina-till. It is to be noted that tho villago granted has been described to bo wituated in the Uttaravalli-vishaya in the 8th lino of the genuine plato A. The village Kilga, where the platos wore unearthed, is about 18 inilos to the north of Sônpur town; and about savon miles from this village of Kolch is a villago called Achonda which I identify with Attēnda mentioned in the 9th lino of plate A. It may also bo noted that the village Kamalapura mentioned in plato C (1.17) as well u$ in plate D (1. 10) is also in the Uttaru-lira and is within a short distance from the village Kolga. 
If we abstract from a slight difference in size (duo wholly to irregnlarity in giving proper shape to tho plates), the plates A and B may be said to be aliko, having been ongrated at the same time by ono engravor with lotters fully similar. Tho first plate (A) is thinner. and is broken slightly ut tho right hand upper cornor. The Voight of plate Ais 254 tolas ugd that of B is 351 tolas. There is a crack in the middle of plato A oxtending from ra of parimộstara (1.0) to hã of mahasrara (1. 5). Both theso plates (irregularly shaped) measure generally 8 inches x 4 inches. On the reverso side of plate B (at the top) a fow letters in ono line wero attempted to be engraved; but they are not quite legible because of imperfcot impression. Plate C was made almost similar to plates A and B. It measures 81" x 41 and has a weight of 37 tolas. The fourth plate or plate D is wbolly dissimilar to the other plater. It measures 7" x 4and has a woight of 331 tolas. The hola perforated at the 
i t in I think more probable that there were only three plates, and that the words inscribed on the reverse af plato Bare the la:t onck of the original grant. The first half of the line forms the continuation of tbe last line un tile oliverse. The last half of tho liuo probably gavo information about the writor. The missing plato was pro. Lally.in-cribed on both sides. -S, K.]

top is also of a smaller diameter. All the four plates, togethor with tho soul which adhorus to the ring, weigh 140 tolas. 
the letters engravod are similar in the main to the letters of tho plntes of tho Trikalińca Guptas. There is, however, sufficient evidency to show that they aro of a later time. The comoonnd letters rnna (1. 1, plato A), chchhu (1.3, plato B) in the genuino plates rosemble wholly the modern Oriyā lotters; whilo the lottors nya, nka throughout surl ri in l. 10, plato A, 1'0

This grant, issued from the town of Sönpur (Suvarnnapurāt, plato A, 1, 1), makes & mention of a Paranamalēýrarı Paranabhatūraka Tsharafidhirajo Paranix(27 Sõma. külatilaka Trikalingādhipati Sri-Mahābhayagupta-raja-dēva to start with. But from the manner in which this mention in marle, it is dillicult to say which Mahābhavagupta is referred to. It is not clear whether Srimal-U[do]dyōta, who is called it Kësarin, is roly alineal descendant of the Guptas. Tho Brahmēóvara templo inscription at Bhuvausvart of this twelfth century A.D. mentions this Uddyota Kõvarin. It is quite evident that the Kōgala country (11. 4 and 9, plato A), within which the Sonpur Stato was still then included. was boing governed by the governors of the Guptos; for tho whole tract of tho Küsnlit conna is said to have been granted (prastidtkrila) by Udıyota Kisarin to Abhimanyu Döva al and 5, plate A), and we learn that Kumärādbirāja Sõmēsvara-dēva of tho Lunar me 
Jord of the Soupur tract then known by the name Paschima-Lankā (ll. 5 and 8. plato A), at the time of this grant. The peoplo of Sonpur know it by tendition that onco the Stato had such a anmo as Paschima-Lanka. A small rock in the bed of the Malinauli within it stone's throw from the palnco of the Maharaja is called Lurkośvari, and this Taikosvari has been referred to as Lankavarttaka in the Maladi copper-plates of Yügisvaraiovavarman." The Ratnapur gtono inscription of Jajalla Diyar montions tho fact that this Raja of Dakshina Kodalo doftated the Raja of Andhra-Khimidi in Ganjām and also & noighbouring Rijn. Somośvara by name. I am inclined to identify tho latter with the Somośvara of this grant, 
I have given practioally tho translation of Plato A. Plato B containg only thogo improcatory versos which are met with in other copper-plato grants; as such they do not roquiro to be translated. Bosides tho namo of the grantor and his ancestors, there is nothing of such importance in plates C and D that it is necessary to translate them. The grantos and his ancestors belonged to the llirita götra, bad five rishis for their prarara aud wero students of the Mädhyandina Käņva-sakha.

No. 30-DAYTEWARA SANSKRIT AND HINDI INSCRIPTIONS OF DIKPALADEVA, 
SAMVAT 1760. 
Br Ral BAJADOR HIKA LAT, B.A., NAOIUK. The two stratite slaby on which the above inscriptions are engraved, are found in the temple of the goclitess Dantasyari of Dantēwärä, a village situated on the junction of the Snnklini and Dankini rivers-bout 60 milos south west ol Jagdalpur, tho proront rapital of tho Bastar Stnto, under the admini-tration of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces. They were first brought to light by Colonol Glasfurd, Dopnty Commissioner of the now dotanot Upper (indā vari District in which Bastar was formerly included. About the your 186: Colonel Glasfurl wrote a detailod report on this Dependency, which was published 118 Selection No. 39 from the Records of the Govormeot of India in the Foreign Departmorit. In this ropurt, on }p. 99 and 100, an eye copiy of these inscriptions is given, apparently as road by Marathi clurk, for at the end of one of them there is a uote in Marithi, stating that the remaining 5 lings were not decipheralilo. The transcripts of both the Sanskrit and Hindi inscriptions are Vory (lefcet ive, as alrearly remarkod by me on a former occasion, where I have given the sub sturoy of the records. I now edit the two inscriptions from excellent impressions taken by Mr. Venkoba Run of the Mudrno Archeological Department. ut Tho inscriptions are engruved on 2 loose slabs cach about 21" x 15". Thu Sanskrit record covers a space about 14" square nud contains 23 linor. The average size of letters in the first 5 lines is "#" and in the ronth. The Hindi inscription, which in surmounted by.

of b and u by the name sign and tho pse of tho lottor sh for kh as ip lines 15 and 22 but not ia. variably, cf. likhitan, 1. 22. The ose of ja for ya as in jutra (1. 20) and the antiquatoil sign for jh as in rijhi in l. 13 of the Hindi inscription Aro noteworthy. The composition is not freo from spelling mistakom. It was made by the Rajagura Bhagavāna Mišra, a Alaithila Pandit, who neums to have been fond of jinglog, *hich he hus managed to introduco both in Sanskrit and Hindi, so that, if the record is not verge, it would be concoded that it his ut lenst an ele ment of poetry in it. The principal record in the Sanskrit one, which however contains a verso quoted from the Pratāparudriyik. 
The second record only parports to bo & Hindi version of the first in view of the fact that in the Kali ago thero aro vory fow Sanskrit-knowing men.' It may be notod that the ono is not tho exact trauslation of the other, and tho Ilinili record yives cortain additional information which is not included in the Suuskrit inscription. The variations are howevor very fox and for all intents and purposes the two records are identical in substince. 
The object of tho inscription is to record the occasional ceromony of kulumbayūrio mado by king Dikpaladöva to the shrine of the goddess Dantāvald in the Sunnvat year 1760, corro sponding to A. D. 1702. The ceremony lasted for 5 days beginning on the 14th of the bright fortnight of Chaitra and ending on the 3rd of the dark fortnight of Vuigākha. It is stated that on thun occasion several thousands of buffaloes and goats wero killed, wliereby the waters of tho Sankhini rivor became reil like lirsiunx for 5 days. This appears to havo beon at recognised feature of the cor-mony, 8 Colonel Elliott writing in 1856 snill! When any marringo is colo- brated in the Raja's house or when the Käja first mounts tho throne the whole family of the Rajn go to visit tho goddess and at that timo pot less than a thousand sheep and buffalocs arc sacrificed. This is called kutumbayalri.' It is not clear from our rocords what the occasion wils for tho vītrī in Sarırat 1760, but from the context it may be inferred that it will for thanksgiving for viotory over the Navarangapura fort and for the birth of an heir-apparent, roferred to buluw, on p. 250. 
Tho inscription gives & genonlogy of Dispāladove for 10 generations Arginning from Annamaraja, the first king who settlod in Bastar. He is stated to have been a brothor of Kākati Prataparudra of the Inner race descended from the Pandava Arjuna. Tho original home of the family was in Hastinäputa, whence they migrated to Orangal (Wonugal), whero they ruled for a long timo until the country was invader hy tho Mualmāns. Beiug pursued by the lattor Andamarüja fled to Bastar, where ho established himself as king. Of the first tovon BUCCOhors of Annamarija no information beyond their pames is giveu. Tho Jlindi inscription however montiods 2 queen who built tanks and gardong. Of the Stb Virasimhadēva it is state that ho ruled for 67 years and that he married a Chandalla privrons Vadanakumaridēvi. Their issue was Dikpaladēva who again married in a Chandölla family the prince N Ajabakumari. daughtor of Rão Ratanaraja of Vardi. Tho result of this union will the hair-apparent Rakshapaladēva, who was born when his father was only 18 years of age.

No. 31.-BHANDUP PLATES OF CHHITTARAJADEVA, A.D. 1026. 
BY J. F. Fleer, I.C.S. (RETD.), Pı.D., C.I.E. The record on theso plates, which wore found at Bhāndüp, a village in the Salpette taluka of tho Thāna District, Bombay, was first bronght to notice, from the original plates, by Mr. W. H. Wathon in 1835, in JRAS, first sorion, vol. 2, p. 389; and a reading of the text, with a partial translation, was givon by him in 1837, in tho same' jonrnal, vol. 4, p. 109. Subsoquently the plntos came into the hands of Profossor Bühler, who published a critical reading of the record, with a nearly full translation, in 1876, in Ind. Ant., vol. 5, p. 277, but omitted to give facsimile. Aftor that, the plates were lost sight of till 1913, when they came to light in London : they were then wecured by Sir C. Hercules Read, and are now deposited in the British Museum. I edit the record again, from the original plates lent to me by Sir C. H. Roal, in order to give the long-roquired facsimilo illustration, and to make a few improvements in the generl treatmont of the record and its surroundings. The facrimile has beon prepared from excellent ink-impressions which Mr. Cousens was good enough to make for me ; and the illustration of the scal is from a drawing by lim. The plates have always been known as "the Bbānąüp platos "; tho rcoord is entered under this name as No. 307 in Professor Kiellorn's List of the Inacriptions of Southern India, ante, vol. 7, appendix ; and the name has become 80 well established that we need baidly change it now: bat & more strictly appropriate designation of the record would be “the Nõura grant," as it registers the gift of a property nt a village named Noura, and is not really connected with Bhandup. 
The plates are thrce in number, each about 7}" in width by 41" in height: the first and last plates are engraved on the inner side only ; the focond, on both sidos. Thoy are for the most part well preserved? ; and the inscription is quite legible all through ; but in a 
Lamentas e response The gaps above and below the ring-holos aro the result of the ink-impression, having been made without catting the ring , oot of any damage to the plates.No. 31.)

for places a rather faint supersoript or an anusvira, discernible on the original 
plates, has failed to appear in the lithograph. The platos are atrung on a ring about t" thick and 29" in diameter which passes through holos in them. The ring, has not beon cut. The ends of it are secured by the back part of a seal which is circular, about 2' in diameter. The face of the seal is surrounded by a beaded edge, and benrs, in high relief, a representation of Garuda, the devico on the banner of the Siläldras (ree line 18 of the text), shows as a man with an eagle's boak, aqaatting and facing full-front, with his hands joined palm to palm and bold up before his chest, and with somewhat imaginative wings 
projecting from behind his shoulders : his head is. Scalo "80. 
surmounted by a tiara, and has a hulo buhind it. There 
is no legond on the seal. The woight of the three plates with the ring and seal is closely about 5 lbs. 4 oz. 
The characters are Nägari, of the usual Western India type of the eleventh century, woll and uniformly formed. The average size of them is a little loss than ". The interiors of tho letters show, as usnal, marks of working the engraver's tool. The plates are substantial; and so the letters, though reasonably deep, do not show through on the hacks of the first and last plater. The characters inclado a form of the rather rare jk in Jhanjha, line 8, and jhanpi, lino 18. The forms of Hk and v are very similar ; and so also aro those of ch and v, p and y, and : and 8. The b is always denoted by x; but the cases are few : I have not thought it necessary to mark them by corrocting the text. The vowel e, attached to a consonant, is inade sometimes above tho consonant, as in labhatē, line 1, sometimes on the left of it, according to the earlier practice, as in kātu, line 8: a similar remark applios to this stroke as part of o; contrast Sivõ and kal-opima, line 2. In line 34 we havo forms of the decimal figuros 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9 : the 8, which somonhat rosembles an invorted 4, in peculiar. Tho verres are punotu. ated with single and double marks of punotuation : this 280 of the singlo mark is rathor exceptional for that timo.--The language is Sanskrit, sufficiently acourate all through. The introductory part, as far as lino 16, is given in eleven verses ; and in the subsequent part, in lines 27, 30, 47-50, and 54, there are some of the standard versos on the subjact of tho morit of making grants, the sin of confiscating thum, etc. Verse 1 nges the word yaka, for ya,' who,' for the sake of a rather foeble pun on the namo Gananayaka, 6.6. Ganapati. In line 18 wo have the word jhampin, which is given in Mouier-Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary as meaning an leaper, an ape,' from jhampa, 'a jump': it is usod here in the song of 'one who excels.'! 
1 The expropion hero in tyäga jagaj-jhampin. It occurs in othor inscriptions, too, if I remonbor aright. Bat there are also variations :-- 
(1) tyaga-jagaj.jhanpa-jhanpad-achäryya, in lino 61 of the Khüröpătan Silähára plates of A.D. 1085, 
Ind. Ant., vol. 9, p. 49. For jhampaờa, of which the jhampala and jhampana which we have below seem to be variants, Monier-Williams gives the moaning in music) a kind of noastro': this makes 
it equivalent to jhampa-tila, which also means & kind of cymbal.' In records of the Kadamban of Gos from the Kanarose country, we have the following, which I check sad sopise from ink-impressions : 
(2) tyäga-jaga-jhanpa-jhampal-äohäryya ; in the Gölihaļļi inscription, JBBRAS, vol. 9, p. 296, line 11. (8) tyaga-jaga-jhampa.jhanpan.ächäryya ; in the Siddapur inscription, Ind. Ant., vol. 11, p. 273, line 11. (4) tyaga-jhaga-jhanpap.icharyya ; in the Kittúr inscription, JBBRAS, vol. 9, p. 304, line 8. Here, therm 
is a temptation to regard jhaga ase mistake for jaga.jhanpa ; but it may be taken quite well o the word jaaga ittelf, mbich Kittel gives a neanjag glittering, shining ; notorirty, greatnasa," and wblah is evidently condooted with Monier-Wuliama jhaga-jhagaya, 'to sparkle, dash.'

As regards orthography, we may note the following points :-(1) As remarkod above, the rocord uses e for b throughout, in the fow casos which are involved. (2) The dental sibilant is found very often for the pulatal one ; and this has ontailed many corrections, though, in C4888 of doubtful roadings, I have given the benefit in favour of the record having the right sibiluut, şor s as the case may be : this feature is perhaps due to carolusenous in writing or engraving more than to any orthographical peculiarity. (3) Except in rd, a nasal in combination is very ofton represented by tho anusvāra ; and we have such contrasts as raingo, line 10, against rangu, line S, and paicha, line 23, and panchadasyam, lino 34, against parchabhir, lino 53 : on the othor hand, we find the pasal used, where the unusvāra would have been quito correct, in samrat sar., line 33 (against saivatsura in tho samo lino), and in sumuyavuhär., line 40, and (in sumidhi) in trayan-tēna, line 31, dattīm=ră, line 54, -ūksharam=vi, line 59.

The inscription is a record of the Mahīmandalesvara or great feudatory prince Chhittarajam dēva, A rcernbor of the family of the Silāhāras of the Northern Konkaņ: and the object of it is to notify that he gavo to a Brahman r field at a village named Nourit.

Among the titles given to Chhittaraja in this rocord one is Tagarpura-paramosvara, “ supreme lord of the town Tagars" (line 17).! The ancient city Tagara, mentioned in the first and second conturies A.D, as a place of importanco on tho gront trading-route between the east coast of India and Broach on the wost coast, is the present Tēr, the Tair, Thair, and Ther,' of somo maps and gazetteers, in the Naldrug District of the Nizam's territory, in lat. 184 19', long. 76° 12', about ninoty-five miles towards south-east-by-south from tho woll-known

Paithan on the Godivari. This title does not imply that Chhittarăja had any dominion at Tagara, Tor, which is far away from what was his territory; it only means that his family claimed that city as the original home of their ancestors. The same hereditary title belonged also to another branch of the same stock, that of the Silābāras of Karad. From among various similar titles, and in illustration (if auch is uoeded) of the point that they do not involve territorial dominion, we may oon voniently quoto hero that of " lord of Mähishmati a best of towns," which belonged to the Ahihaya princes of the Gulbarga District. T'hery is not the slightest reason for thinking that the power of any member of Chhittarija'a branch of the Silähāra stock reached anywhere above the Western Ghauts : ospecially in view of the points that tho actual extent of his territory is expressly defiuod in line 20 f. of this record as being “the whole land of the Konkana, comprising many territories acquired by his own arm* and containiog fourteen hundred villages headed by Puri," and that none of the records olain more than tho Konkap, And even the expression “the whole land of the Kańkaņa" must bo takon with a limitation. Tho term Konkan denotes properly the whole strip between the Westorn Ghauts and the Arabian Sea, from the river Tapti sue far cortainly as Pälghung at the south of the Malabar District, Madras, and perhaps As far as Cape Comorin: and the territory consisted of seveu divisions which woro known as "the Suven Konkaps.' Tho Silahüras cortainly did not at any time possess the whole of that territory, from either point of view as to its southern limit. It is unlikely that their power oxtended on the north beyond the rivor Ambikä, which falls into the sea some twelve miles north of Balsár in the Surat District; or at any rate beyond the Pārpa, which flows into tbe son bonio ton or twelve milos farther north in the same district : in A.D, 1051 the territory just abovo tho river Mioglolä, abont eight miles north of the Pūrua, belonged to a Chaluksa or Chanlukya prince Trilochanapula of Latadėšas; and we have also a record of his graadfather Kirtirája from the same parts.? Towards the south, Chhittaraja's uncle Arikósarin (the Kedi dova of tho present record), who is similarly describod in the shiņa plates of A.D. 10178 ag. ruling "the whole land of the Konkana, oomprising many territorios acquired by his own arm, and containing fourtoen hundred villages headed by Puri," seoins to have gained for his family a domain reaching as far perhaps as Goa, by taking the country in that dirootion from a inember of the southern branch of the Silähåra stook, the Mandalika Rattaraja, who was ruling there in A.D. 10089 : but that is the utinost limit that can be given to tho Silābåras in that direction. 
Another of tho titles given hero to Chhittarāja is "the Mahaedmantadhipali who has attained all the panchamahāśabda" (line 16-17). As to the meaning of the term padche mabásabda, regarding which there had been different views, in a full' noto in my Qupta Inscriptions, p. 290, noto 9, I arrived at the conclusion, in agreement with some other writers, that it donotes the sounds of five great musical instruments (pancha-mahavadya), the use of which was allowod, as a spocial mark of distinction, to persons of high rank and

authority. Since then, the term has boen found used in a different sense in Kashmir, als meaning *five officer, the names of which began with the word mahā (mahat), great,'" in & passago in the Rajataraidgini, 4. 140-3, where we are told that king Maktäpida-Lalitåditya (aboat A.D. 700-37) conferred on his minister Mitraśarman the pancha-mahāśalda, Damely mahapratthārapidd, " the office of high chamberlain "; mahāsaidhivigraha, that of "chief minister for peace and war"; mahāśvasali, that of " chief master of the horse"; mahābhandagūra, that of " high keeper of the treasury"; and mulusādhasabhāga, that of “chief executive minister": the text, it may be added, farther seems to imply that the king oreated theso as new posts (80 far as Kasbmir was concerned), over and above the weightcon officea" which already existed. That, however, is a quito exceptional case. We aro concerned bero with the epigraphic use of the term, in which it ocours in connection, not with ministors, but with great feudatory princes and paramount sovereigns. And there is no reason for departing from the decision that the expression refers in the case of Chhittarăja, aud gonorally, to the privilege of having playod before him five such instruments as the fringa or kombi, 'the horn,' the tammata or huliya, 'the tabor, timbrel, or tambourine,' the Stīrikhu or duvalu, 'the concb-sholl,' the bhéri or bājā, the kettlo-drom,' and tho jayayhantā or jyule, 'the boll, cymbal, or gong."

Another instance in which it is found couplod with #paramount titlo, in adılition to thoso givon by me in the note mentioned above, is in a Balagini inscription of A.D. 1168, Pūli, Sanskrit, and Old-Cannese Inscrip tions, No. 183, live 15 ; Epi. Carn., vol. 7, Shimoga, Sk. 123 ; where the Kulnchurya Hijjala is stylod samadhigatapanchamahārabda-makarājādhiraja : but the actuul position of Hijjalı at that time is not cloar; he had a reckoning of his own beginning in A1), 1156; but the Wostorn Chilukya Taila IT WILS still rcigoing, at least nominally, in A.D. 1168 and down to 1161. 
The reason why tho Cakta aro so few in which there is a mention of the pañchamahifabila in connection withi praramount sovereigns, is obviously that tho privilege belonged to thein #8 x matter of course. Iu literature the playing of the pañcha.mahālabda and auspicious druins in a royal procession is inentioned in a puasago from a talo by a Jain Kanareso writor, Rõväkötyachiirya, given in Ind. Int., vol. 12, p. 96: the words theru are puñohamahafabiangalin haddaranaila pare(re)galuă băjise. 
To my provious potcs on this mattor (see also vol. 5 above, p. 210, uoto 3) the following may he added : 
(1) Two cascs of ministers who posscoged this privilege, but who were also Sämantas, aro (a) the Mahasathdkivigrahika, the Samanta Bappabhatți, who wrote the record of A.D. 739 on the Nuusüri plates of the Chalukya prince Avanijamásrnya-Pulakäsirajı of Gujarat ; Sevcuth Oriental Congress, Vionna (1886), Arian Soction, p. 294, toxt line 49; bere the torm is prāpta" instead of the usual semadhigain"; and (6) the Mahirandhivigrahādhikrita, the Samanta Mändalla, who wrote the record of A.D. 775 on the Pimpari plates of the Rashtrakūtu prince Dhärāväraha-Dhruvarija of Gujarat; vol. 10 above, p. 89, text lines 05-6. 
(2) From lineæ 56-0 of the record of Tivaradöva on the Baloda plates wo learn that his non-in-law Nannarija (who is mentioned witbout any indication of princely or official rauk) had this privilego ; vol. 7 alovc, p. 105; and line 2 (88 also line 2 of the Rijim plates, Gupta Insoriptions, p. 291) speaks of it as belonging to princes in general. 
(3) The record on the Kanker plates of A.D. 1213-14 speaks of tho priviloge in conuection with the Mahamandalika Pamparajalova am & boon obtained from thu goddess Katyayani; vol. 9 above, p. 108, text line 2. 
(4) A mention of the panchamahatabda of the Jaius, as a religious item is found in an inscription of A.D. 1308, embolying a compact hotweon the Jwing and the Vaishnuvas which wus saactionod by king Bukkurāya [ of Vijayanagara; Epi. Carn., vol. 2, Inscra. at Sravaņa-Helgola, No. 136. 
These are tho instrumenta, specified according to both tboir Sanskrit and their Kaparose or other vernacular pamen, in the passage in the Kanarese Vivõkachintamani (reforred to io Ind. Antu, vol. 12, p. 00) A# given by Kittel in his Kaunad.-English Dictionary wodor pancha-mahārūdya. Cader aydu, he leie quoted from Mangarāja's Nighanţa & list of the aydu uitama-vădya or "Qvo beat musical instruments" as being nipe, 'tbe late,' tūla, 'the cymbal,' nuraja, the lawbouring,' kahale, 'the metal horn or trumpet,' and tāsa, 'the fute or ife. There was evidently a differcnce betwoon the “ great " instruments and the best" onon!

The details of the date of this record (lines 32-5) aro, the Baka year 948 expired, the Kshaya sa invatsara ; the fifteenth tithi of the bright fortnight of Kärttika; Ravi, i.e. Ravivára (Sunday); an eclipse of the sun. The dato is an irregular odo; boca 180, on even a preliminary point, of course there cannot be an eclipfe of the sun on the fifteenth tithi of the bright fortnight, 1.e. at tbe fall-moon. For the rest the position 'is as follows:1--The Kihnya suivutsara in question begao, as a Chaiträdi lunar year according to the southern lunisolar system of the cycle, on 22 March A.D. 1028. The full-moon tithi of Kürttika anawered in that year to 28 Octobor, on which day it ended at 18 hrs. 18 min. after mead sunrise, 4.8. 18 min. after midnight, (for Ujjain); but the day was a Friday (not a Sunday as stated): thoro was a large eclipse of the moon, visible in India); bnt, as has been said, the record *pecifies an eoli pao of the sun. The now-moon tithi of Kārttika angwured in that same year to 12 November, on which day it ouded at about 1 hr. 38 inin, after menn sunriso (for Ujjain); but the day was a Saturday (not & Sunday): thore was an annnlar eclipse of the sun; but it was not visiblo in India : and, as has beon said, the record specifies the full-moon tithi. In these circumstances, while the intended date seems to have been either 28 October or 12 Novomber A.D. 1020, and while there may be & preferouce in favour of the earlier data because of the oclipso which certainly occurred visibly thôn, wo cannot decide whioh of these two days was renlly moant; beca1150 the week-day is not right from either point of view. 
Of the local placos mentioned in this record, tho first in a town named Puri, which is marked as the chief town of a provinco consisting of fourteen hundred villages (line 20 f.) : it and its province aro thus reforred to in the record with a view to locating in u goneral way the village at which the grant was mado. Various proposals havo hoon made to identify Purit: but the namo is too vague for any cortain conclusion to bo arrived at. An idea, however, as to the position and extent of the fourteon-hundred province of which it was the chief town, is got as follows. As will be seen, the places mentioned 'in the present record vero in the Salsotte täluka of the Thana District. Further, in the Thüpa plates of A.I). 1017 there is the same reference as in our prosent record to "the fourteen hundred villages headed by l'uri"; and at any into one of the villages granted by that rocord, namely Chāvināru, can bu identified (808 p. 260 below), and is found in tho Bhiwņdi täluka of the same district, immediately on the north-east of the Sālrotto Jäluka. Again, tho Bhādåua grant of A.D. 9978 places in the Mahirihára vishnya of what it calls "the Konkan markod out by foarteen hundred villagos" the village Bhadana, which is about seven miley farther on towards the east-north-east in the Bhiw di tūlnka. And the record on tho Khüripatan platos of A.D. 1095,7 which makes tho same reference that wo have in our present record to the wholo land of the Konkapa and the fourteon hundred villages headed by Puri, ahows by its statomento in lines 77-9 that the Puri province included the ports of Sthanaka, Nāgapurg, Surpäraka, and Chēmüli or Chēmülya, which it says, woro "on tho coasts in the Kunkana

(1.8. Konkapa) fourteen-hundred." Stbånaka is the present Thang itself. Någapura has not been identified. But Surpäraka is Sopark or Supark, near the coast in the Bassein täluka of the Thāpa District, some thirty miles north of Bombay. And Chomili or Chêmälya in Ohenwal, Chāul, Chaul, on the coast, in the Alibag taluka of the Kolaba District, about twenty-five miles south of Bomhay. Thoe, the Puri or Konkana tourteon-bundred seems to answer fairly closely to the Bassein, Salgette, Bhiwndi, and Kalyan tālnkas, with perhaps also the Karjat täluka of Thåpa, and the Panwel, Paņ, and Alībag tålukas of Kolába. 
As regards other local places, the record registers the grant of a field, presumably a large one, in a villago named Noura (line 4%), which it places in the Shatshashţi-vishaya and in (the torritory of the famous Stbanaka." This last namo, Sthanaka, is, of course, the earlier form of the prosent Thaņēm, Thāna. Shatabashți is the present Sashti, Salsette the island which forms the taluka of which the bend-quarters station is at Thàņa : its name means "sixty-six," and marks it as having consisted originally of a group of sixty-six village84: this name is found in tho intermediate form of Sāsaţi in the shipa plates of the Dāvagiri-Yadava king Rāmacbaudra dated in A.D. 127:2.In defining the field that was granted, the record tells us that it was bounded on the east and north-east by Gomvani; on the south by Görapavali; and on the west by tho king's high-Way. Wo may safely follow Professor Bühler in identifying Noura with it village in the Salsetto tāluka shown &# Nowobur' in the Indian Atlas sheet 25 (1854), in lat. 19° 9', long. 73° 1', about two miles south-south-west from Thāna, and Gomvani with the Gowhan' of the samo map, about half a muilo north-by-cast from Nowohur,' which, it may be addod, is shown about ono mile und a half vorth-cast from Bhiodāp: these two villages, however, do not exist now: the Atlan quarter-slicet 25, N.E. (1905), marks thu places which they occupied as being now wasto land on the foreshore of the Thāna Creek. The maps do not show any representative of Gorapa vali, which mist bave been somowhero on the east of Nour, and perhaps was a hamlet (palli, valt) of that place: this village must have disappeared even beforo tlo other two.7

SPECIAL NOTES. 
1. The city Hanyamana, Hamjamana. In lino 26 wo read that the notification contained in this record on the Bhandup plates was addressed to (among other people) "the three classes of citizens, and others, of the oity Hamyamana." The same place is mentioned, in the name way, in the Thina platos of A.D. 2017, and again in line 72 of the Khåropấtan plates of A.D. 10951: but in the last-mentioned rcoord the name is given, with a slight but perhaps instructive difference, as Hamjamana. And it has been proposod, on tho strength of the latter form, to identify this city with Sarjan or Sanján,-a place on a oroek and near the sea, in the Dühånů tāluka of the Thana District, about ninety milos north of Birnbay,-- which, now only an ordinary village, has been thought to have beon a town of considerablo importance iu bygone times. The case is, in brief, 88 · follows: 
A Persian poem ontitled Kissah--Sanjan, written in A.D. 1600,8 says that one hundred and fifteen years after the death of Yazdajird (16 June A.D. 632), that is, in A.D. 747, the PATBees cumo by wbip from the island of Hormuz to India, and landed and settled at Dib, that is Div, Din, on the coast in the south of Kathia wār. Ninetcen years later, in A.D. 766, somo angury lod thom to niovo on: so they sailed to (lajaråt, and after a tempestuous voyage arrived at Sanjān. After giving certain explanations, they were made wolcome by the local ruler, a good and righteous princa na mcd Jadi Rina,' who gare them pormission to make & settlement in his territory. So they selected a vacant spot "in the desort," in forest land and anoulti vated, but pleasant, and cleared it, and raised a city to which their Dastor gave the pare Sanjān,-in nupraory (it is suggostod) of places lxoring that namo in Khorasan and elsewhere in Persia : and with tho permission of the Rāja the land was cleared for three farsakhe all round, so that they might bo without any hindrance in keeping ap the swored fire of Babram. And there they alsode for three hundred years "moro or less"; which takes us on to about A.D. 1066. During the Dext two centurica, it seems, some of thein went on and settled at Nausäri, Vankiner, Bronch, Auklėshwar, Cambny, and other places. Later on, apparontly about A.D. 1507, troublo arosc at Sanján, through an invasion by the Musalmin ruler of Chămpanér: but into this we need not go. 
In connection with that recital, it has been proposed to explain Harojumada as the original name given by the Parsees to their settlement, and Sanjau as the corruption thereof, figuring naturally though by an anuchronism (it is urged) in the Persian poem because the latter was written so lato ns in A.D. 16005; to account for the name as being equivalent to the present term (juman, used by the Parseen in the senso of "an assombly, a large communal meeting," from the Arestic har,' together,' and jam, 'to go'; to explain trivurga, tho three classes,' referring to the Avostic word thr yavan, denoting the three grades of the priestly olaas, the Dastars, Mobeds, and Herbeds; and to account for the epigraphic references to the place on the gtounds that this foreign independent community at Savjãn was of such importance as to deserve, if not to actually require, attention of that kind.

All tbat reads well: bat there aro objections. (1) While the account in the Kissuh-i. Sanjan oertainly seems to refer to tho present Sanjan in the Dáháng táluka, wo are told that the belief that Sanjan was an important place in former times rests on a' misunderstanding of statements by the Arab geographers of the tenth to the twelfth centurica and that their refer enoeg to a place called Sindän by them belong, not to Sanjin, but to a town in Catch, Bome-. where near Cambay : this, then, disponos of the idea tbat Sanjān ius formerly a place of apecial importance. (9) The word trivrga scoms to be a well-established terin for the three higher Findd castes, the Brahmaus, Kshatriyas, and Vaikyas : and it is to be notod that it occurs again in a passage of the same general nuturo in line 48 of the Bhüdāna grant of A.D. 997, in which record there is no mention at all of the placu Hanyamala, lamjamana. (3) As regards etymology, the usnal change is from s tol, not from h to s: wo might expect to have a form Hanjia from Sainjamana, but dot Sanjān from Hamjamana. And :4) it is not easy to think that Hindu rulors would deem it necessary to address a communiiy of foreigners in reepoct of donations in which those foroignors were not in any way concoruou, and which could not liavo the slightest interost for them. 
: More evidonce iş wanted, to settle this matler in any particular direction. Bit wo aro at Jeast not disposed to accept the identification of Haryamana, Haujamana, with Sanjān. It Jooks as if tho place was some administrativo head-quarters of tbene Silähårit princes, apart from their actual anpital, where their oflicial records and archivos vero written and kopt, and pnblio notifications woro inguod about any nunttors likely to be of any general intorest. 
2. The places mentioned in the Phāņa plates of A.D. 1017. This record, No. 306 in Professor Kielhorn's List of the Inscriptions of Southorn India, ante, vol. 7, appendix, is on three plates which were found in 1786 or 1787, along with other set of three platos which cannot bo identified, in digging for some new works at the fort at Thāne. It is much wishod that these plates could be tracel; so that a critical edition of the record might be published, with a facsimile. As matters stand, for our knowlurigo of its contents we are dependent on the translation hy Ramalochana Pandit, with a partial transcrip tion of the text as far perhaps as tho end of the first plate, communicated by Goneral J. Carnac, and published in 1789 in the Asiatic Researches, vol. 1 (fifth edition, 1806), p. 357. 
It is a record of the Silahāra princo Arikēmaridēvam, whoso damo is given as Kāśideva in the Bhandap plates (see p. 253 above). It is dated in the Pingnla survatsara, Snka 939 expired; on the full-moon of Kürttika" ; on the occasion of an eclipse of thu moon: and these details answer quite regularly to 8 Novomber, A.D. 1017, on which day thero was an eolipso of tbe moon, visible in India, the moment of full-moon being at 19 hrs. 22 min. after nean suorise, i.e. at 1 hr. 22 min, after midnight, (for Ujjain).3 
Just as the record on the Bhündüp plates of A.D. 1026 dnes in the case of Chhittara ju, so this record doncribes his unclo Arikosarin 28 ruling "the whole land of the Konkana, comprising many territories acquired by his own arm, and containing fourteen hundred villages headed by Puri" ; the last statement being made with a viow to locating in a genera way the grants that were made, by indicating the province.

(VOL. XII. 
. The notification contained in the record was issued to (among others) all the inhabitants of "the city the famous Stbånska (Thipa)," and to "all the holy men and others inbabit. ing the city Hanyamana or Hamjamana." And it announces the grant of three villages to a Brühman who was an inhabitant of "the city the famous Sthånaka," as follows: 
1. The first village was Chăvināra, “standing at the extromity (porhaps we should rather any on the edge'] of the territory of Vatnarija." It was bounded, on the east by the village Paagamba (wo should probably read Paagāmva] and "a water-fall from a mountain"; on the south by the villages Nāgāmbă [road probably Nāgāmvā]* and Malădongariká; on the west by tho river sâmbarapallikā; and on the north by the villages Bambivê and Kațiyalaka. 
We muy enfely identify Chavināra with the Chavindra' of the Indian Atlas qoartar wheet 24, S.E. (1903), in lat. 19° 18', long. 73° 8', in the Bhiwodi tālukn of the Thāna District, one mile and a half east-north-east from Bhiwņdı, and abont ton miles north-east-half-north from Thapa. This name, it may be added, is not shown in the Atlas. full sheet 24 (1857), where the place for it is filled by the name Bhowndeo' in capitals : but it is entered, as 'Chávindri,' in the Postal Directory of the Bombay Circlo (1879, and socond odition 1888). The maps and Postal Directory do not show any names answering to Mülådongariki, Sâmbivo, and Kātiyālaka : unless, by chance, Sâmbivo (in which the bis vory questionable)6 is a printer's muistake for Sīrdiva, 1.c. Sārdivo, in which case this village might easily he the 
Sauda' of the quarter-sheet, one mile north of Chavindra." But balf a mile onst-by-north from Chavindra' there is the 'Pobgaon' of the full sheet, the 'Pogaon' of the quarter sheet, al16wering to tho Piagamba (? Puagānvā) of the record, with bills close on the east and south-easto where we might easily find the "water-fall from a mountain." And about three quarters of a milo south-west-by-south from "Convindru' there is the Nagaon, Nagaon' of the mape, annwering to the Năgâmbă (? Nāgāmva) of the rocord. Abont ono mile on the wost, there is a large nullah, the 'Kamwarce, Kampari,' of the maps, which may be a later namo of the Sambarapalliká river of the record. 
2. The second village was Tokabalāpallikā?; this was bounded on the east by Sidabali ; on the south by tho river Mothala ; on the wost by Kakadēva, Hallapallika, and BĀdaviraka; and on the north by Talavalipallikā. 
3. Tho third village w46 Aulakiya, which was bourdod, on the east by Tadaga; on the south by Govini; on the weat by Charikā; and on the north by Kalibaldgaobõli. 
I have not succeeded in finding these two gronps of places. The Postal Directory gives possible equivalents for some of the original names as follows: for the first gronp, Sadayli, Bhedáli, Sherivli, Sláloli, Vadvibír, Wadvir, Talavli, and Talávli; and for the second group, Åvla, Ayli, Covnna, Chari, Cbarív, Kalavli, Kálavli, Kalivli and Kalvár.

* Tho transcription of the text does not go as far as this. I quote, as far as "city," the wordó given in the published translation. The translation gives - Hanyamana", with, no doubt, # printer's mistake of w form or of y forj (see p. 258 above). For the rest of the expression we can hardly doubt that the text has in reality magara-paura.triparoga-prabhritithf-cha, like line 20 of the Bhãngüp plate of A.D. 1026 and line 72 of the Ktirëpätno platos of A.D. 1095.

(Verse 2) May he, Siva, always protect you, op whose crown thero shines tho Jahnavi (the Gangos). losombling the clear digit of the moon rising over the sunnit of Samoru! 
(Verso 3) (There was) Jimutakétu'son, always compussionato, renowned thronghout the three worlds by tho uame Jimātavāhana, who, counting his own body as (more) grass for

(Verse 1) In his lineago thero aroso a king, Kapardin (I), a forehead-mark of the Silāra race, who destroyed the pride of (his) onemios : aud from him thero was a son, by name Pulasakti, possessed of intense splendour equal to (Thut of) the sun. 
(Verse 3) Thun there was born his son, Laghu-Kapardin (4.. " Kaparilin junior," Kapar din II), through fear of whom all (his) enemios offordd up freoly, for tho welfuru of (thrir) kingdoms, water in (their) hamis joined together so as to make cnpy.

As Bühler poiuted out, this verse contains & prio on tlio xyllabko: gananüyakah : from one point of view thene denote Grgura ti as "the leader of the Clawns, the attendent# of Siva," wliv, being alo tho god of wisiluu und obstacles, is frequently invoked at the beginulug of undertakings, specially of a l arg nuturu ; from the othor priut of viow, they have to be analysed us meaning gawanull, accusative plural o u nand, counting,' an! vakan, yan, 'who.' It is rather difficult to find a suitablo rendoring of the words lubhali yonunu, lit.

Tho allusion is to a story which is found in the Kuthaagritsagarn, chapters 2% and 90: translation by Tawney, vol. 1, p. 174 ; vol. 2, p. 307. Jimūtakötu was a king of the Vidlyndhuras, it class of deunigoly; int Jinātavābana was his son and beir. Garuda, the eagle-man, the servant and vehicle of Vishnu, hul obtainel from Vishậu tho bouu that tho Nigas, the serpent-men, should be his food; and Väsuki, king of the serpents, went ono . f thom every day to serve as the required meal.

Meanwhile, the goddoss Gauri, ploased by the devotion paid to her by Jimůtavahana's wife, camo und raivod nectar op him, and I o restored hiin to life.

(Verse 7) From him there was a son, the illustrious king Vajjadudáva (I), a head-jewel of the cirolo of the earth, the renowned fame of whose achievements oa daed astonishment and was attractive : the goddess of sovereignty, going quickly of her own scoord on the fold of battle, took delight (in resting) on the bosom of him whose only force was the stat of (his) arm, just like the godd on the bodom of (Vishga) the Foe of Mura, 
(Verbes 8, 9) As Jaynnta (was born) from [Indra] the Foe of Vritra, and Shanmukha [Karttikoya) from (Siva] the Foe of Pura, so from him there was a glorious son, Aparajita, of good achievements, who manifestly (was) a very Karpa in liberality and & Yudhishthira in truth, and, being a very sun in splondour through (his) brilliant power, a staff of Death to (his) enemies. 
(Vorge 10) From him there was (a son) pamod Vajjadadēva (II): and thón (thora was) the illustrious Kösidēva, elder brother (of Vajjugadēva II). 
(Verso 11) Tlie non of his (Kasideva's) brother, a son of Vajjaqedoya (II), was a king, the illustrious Chhittarāja, by whom, cyou when he was child, boing eminent, the Silāra race was raised to a very high elovation. 
(Lino 10) Accordingly, while the drahanındalostura the illustrious Chhittarājadeva, who through the development of his own religious merit is adorned by the whole liat of kingly titles beginning with "tbu Malustīmantadhiputi who has attained allt [the sounds of the fivo great musical instruments, the supreme lord of the town Tagara; tho Silahāra king ; boru in the lineago of Jimütevabata ; ho who has the banner of a golden Garuda; howlio is by nature a Vidyadharag, he who excels in the world in liberality* ; crest-juwel of chieftains ; a cage of thandorbolto 1o (protnot) those who come for refuve," is ruling over the whole land of tho Konkann, comprising many territories acquired by his own arni, and containing fourteen hundred villages headed by Puri: 
(Line 21) And while those who are bearing the burden of the earus of this kingdom are the Sarrādlikūrin the illustrious Nāganaiye, the Sundhirigralika tho illustrious Sihapaiya, the Karnata-Sandhivigrahika the illustrious Kapardin, and the Srikarana and other five ininisters : 
(Lino 23) At thia corrent time, he, the Muhanandalēšvara the illustrious Chittarājadova, makes a communication, with oxpressions of anlatation and worship and respect, to all future sons of kings, counsellors, prieste, councillora, ministers, minor ministers, and functionaries, both those connocted with himsolf and others too, also to tho lord of the country, the lord of the district, the lord of the oity, tbo lord of the villago, the Niyukta, the Aniyukta, the king' men, and the country people, and also to the three classes of citizens, and othert, of the city Hamyamana : 
(Line 27) Be it known to you as follows:-Power is fluctuating ; youth is shattored in a moment; life lien liet ween the tooth of Death: the body is sabject to the growing and dying which are natural to worldly existence; wealth and health are more unstable than drops of water on the leaves of a group of water-lilies shaken by the wind : having thought of this, they confirm tho advantage of making gifts. And so it has been said by the saintly V Fåga : "Gold is the first offspring of fire; the earth is the daughter of Vishnu ; and cows are the childron of the suo : vorily the three worlds are given by him who gives gold and a cow and land !"

BY LIONEL D. BARNETT. Yèwür is a villago in the Shoräpúr or Snråpur taluke of the Gulbarga Distriot of the Nizam's territory. It is shown as “Veyoor 'in the Indian Atlas ahcot 57 (1854), in lat. 16° 44', long. 76° 40', and as · Yeyoor' in the Hyderabad Survey sheet 79 (1885): it is situated about seventeen milds north-wont-by-north from Soorapoor,' and forty-two miles towards east-by-north from Brgewüli in the Bijapur District, Bombay. The inscriptions give the earlier form of the name as ühür ; and one of them, C, of A.D. 1105, places it in an ancient territorial division known as the Sagara three-hundred, regarding which see p. 272 below. At Yöwur there aro goven inscriptions, ranging in date from about A.D. 1040 to 1178 : I an editing thom from ink.impressions furnished by Dr. Fleot, and am doing them under his guidance, as this is my first essay at dealing with Kanarese epigrapbo.

This inscription is on a stone built into a wall near the house of the Mathapati-Ayya, in the village. At the top of the stone there are sculptures: the sun and moon ; below them, & linga on an alishika-stand, a recumbent bull, and a cow and calf; and below the linga a Beated figure. The writing covers & space about 1'7" broad by 1' 5" high, and is well presorved as far as it good. The characters aro Kanarose, of the eleventh century: the size of them rapgoa from about i" to 1". The language is Old-Kaparose proso.

This inscriptiou is on the four faces of stone in a detached maptapa nt . temple, on the north of the villago, wbioh is now known as the temple of Someivara. The stone is about 6' 4" high: the front and biok facos ara about % 6" wiile, and the two side 14068 are about l' 4" wide. A space about 8' high at the top of the front face is occupied by soulptures : in the contre, a lingu op en abhishëka-aland; on the left, two nated figures, with the sun above thema; on the right, a cow and a oall, with a crooked sword or dagger and the moon above them. 
The writing covers all the rest of that faon and the whole of the other faves : it includes two short neparato records, each of three lines: one is below line 65 on the front; the other follows line 283 on the second side face. It is in a state of good prenervation almost all through. Io linos 198 and 109 thoro were loft blank spaces of about 8" and 7", apparently because of some fault in the stone which provontcd easy incision there. The characters are well-formed Kanareso onca, characteristic of the eleventh century. Tho size of the letters rungos from about to : they are mostly between and . Ja sit-ankuran, line 180, of the very rare initial si. In the word kaleyal, line 283, the viriima on the last consonant is indicatod by tho vowel +, a mode of writing often used on other inscriptions; but elsewhere in the present rooord (e.g. mattar, line 232, iral, line 235, etc.) it is denoted by its proper sign, which somowhat resom blen & superscribed c. The vowel e is noually denoted hy the curve on the top of the consonant; bat in a few canon we find instead the loop on the right-band foot of the consonant (Ededore, 1. 129 ; bellugalan, l. 174 ; Maleyaļa, I. 226; Wiriwajeya, I. 227; kavileya, 1. 201; kavileyuman, 1. 266; kilé, l. 267).-The language of the inscription is from the beginuing to line 104 Sanskrit, and thence to the end Old-Kanarese, including howover the usual minatory Sanskrit vorscs on lines 266-76. The Kanntenc portion is interest ing in various l'espects. It contains several words or forms of words which are not to be found in Kittel's Dictionary: on l. 140, wpiste, for updati; on l. 144, mantana, with the sense of muhantatuna ; on I, 146, anita, on wbich ace Ind. Ant., Vol. XVIII, p. 273, 1. 16; ou l. 163, nimilda, the past participle of nimel, npparently the same as nimir; on l. 176, amaldu, for the ordinary amardu or amrita ; on ll. 178, 184, lippu,"bravo! well dono !” a form found also in other inscriptions, for which Kittel gives only bãpu and bhapu; on l. 191, rõdisi, showing a variant of the root which Kittel giros only in the form tõdu; on I, 221, pavitra, for the coading 
apparently & variant of puuuda (perbapa a derivative from the Sanskrit prābhrita), whiol Kittel ex plaius as "& cloth waved like a fan in front of a procession";on 1. 222, vakkhanist, as in some other inscriptions, for which Kittel has only the forms okkunisu and vakkaņisu ; on 11. 229, 233, baliya, for baliya, in the sense of antarvartin and madhyavartin, on which see JBBRAS, Vol. X, p. 280, pote 37, and Ind. Ant., Vol. IV, p. 181, note * ; on 11. 281, 236, 239, 242, 249, 251, ghale, here clearly meaning amoasuring staff,' and found in other inscriptions as well as the 
gadimba, a word found in other inscriptions, and apparently denoting a particular measure off length (oompere I. 238, müvatt-ayda-gana Danavinndana ghale); on l. 237, kuliya, of avknown meaniug; on I, 241, gnido, rice-laod,* & form found in other insoriptions (e.g. Ind.

Vol. IV, p. 180, l. 16), as is also the form garde, and which stands to the modern gade in the namo relation As maltar, occurring in some inscriptions, to mattar (11. 232, 236, 239, 242, 248, 250-4 of the present record); on l. 251, ede-oola (a compound of ede and pola), which possibity may mean" land of modiam height or quality"; on H. 855-8, tēja, by itself and in tho compounds tēja-svāmya and tējadavar, apparently meaning some kind of right of asnfruct (compare ashabhoga-teja-svāmja in some inscriptions).

#bidorgge on line 188. Beside the regular kalpa (1. 301) we find kalpa (11. 160, 162, 181), which is not known to Kittel. The forto purps (1. 203) is toond in Kittel's Dictionary and some inscriptions, and is parallel to be spellings nirpanda, mitpanna, nirpavaka, barpa, varpūra, recorded by Kittel :-in auch cases it is possible that the r represents the old upadhmd. niya breathing, which was designated by a character similar to that of the consonant r. 
As regards the contents of the inscription, it falls into thrve parts. The first part (lines 1.104) is a Sanskrit historical. poem recounting the pedigreo of the Western Chalukya kings down to Vikramadityn VI; it has been notiood in connection with the Nilganda inscription reci·ntly published in this journal (p. 149 Above), and acod not be discussed furthor here. As the composer or editor of the inscription tells us (lines 105, 106), this prelude bas been copied from a charter on oopper-platos ; und the copyist has done his work so slavishly that at the end of it he has actually incladed the words Sa tu, with which tho formal deed of conveyance legan on the original plntos (lino 104). Tho second part (line: 107-204) is a poem in Old-Kanarese celebrating the virtues of a certain Ravidēva (Raviyang or Raviga), a Brälıman minister of high rank, and of his ancestors, especially in connection with his construction of a temple of SvayambhfaSiva at Yêwir, and concluding with praise of the Pergade Någavarma, to whorn this pious work was deputed. The third part (lines 205-283) contains the formal docd of conveyance, recording the grant of certain lands to the templo of Yêwir at tho instance of Ravidēva, and concluding with tho usual Sanskrit minatory verse against infraction of tho gift and womo Kanarose rules prercribing celibacy for tho inmates of the sanctuary. 
Ravidēva, the hero of our inscription, was a Brahman of distinguishod anco:try. The first of his lineage who is here mentioned is Röyaņabhatta, of tho KĀśyapa yntra (1. 138), after whoin are yamed his son Saukarúry& and the latter's son Koppalara or Koppava (11. 139-141). Koppadova, who was appointed a royal treasurer by the Westorn Chalukya king Jayasimba II, married Pampakable or Pampadovi, and by her han six sons, viz. Våvanůrya, Sunkarúrsa, Rovaņa, Máchaya, Ravidova, and Srivara (11. 145, 152, 160). Rividova marriod Dövalabbe, who bore him Nachapa (Nichi), Koppa, Varana, Rovana, and Soviga (11. 156-158, 160, 199). Verse 85, line 173 f., tells us that he held high offices under three suocessivo kings: he was inado Lāļa-gandhivigrabin by king Ahavamallit (Sõmēsvara I), from whom he received the villages of Mukkundo, Gangapura, and thir (Yownr), which he settled upon his family (11, 160-170); Somèsvara II appointod him his Heri-sandhivigrabin (1. 171); and Vikramaditya VI gave him authority to use the insignia of royalty (11. 172-173). In this connection we mny notice the intorosting point raised in the words tunnayad-onde tepadhà-visuddliyiin of l. 145, "by the unique manner in which he showed his uprightness under test": from the Kauțiliya Artha-sõstra, prakarına 6, p. 16 (compare Kámandakıya Niti-sära iv. 25, upudha-dodhitäh), wo know that it was a feature of Hindu polity to test tho virtue of officials in the fire of templation; and our toxt supplies us with an actual instance, 
The details of the date of this inscription (1. 213 ff.) are : the Pingala sa inputsura, being the second year of the Chalukya-Vikrama-yaruha, me of the reign of Vikramaditya VI; the fall-moon of Sravana ; Adityavára (Sunday); an eclipse of the moon. On this Dr. Flott gives me the following remarks :-"The Pingala sa rvatsara in question began, to a Chaitrādi ladar year according to the southorn lanisolar system of the cycle, on 26 February, A.D. 1077. The given tithi, the full-moon of Sråvana, answers in that year to 6 August, on which day it ended at 21 hrs. 21 min. after mean sunrise (for Ujjain). That day was a Sunday, as 
Mr. Krishna Sastri remarks that an inscription at Hüvitabadagalli mentions a certain Raviyana and his wilo Robbalabbe as having built there a teinple to Kēšava-svämni (Ep. Report, 1914, p. 67).

specificit. And on it there was a total eclipse of the moon, visible in India. Accordingly tho date angwere quite satisfactorily to Sunday, 8 August, A.D. 1077." 
Among the places mentioned in this record, tho first is the Brahman village Mukkunde on the river Kirudose in the Eqedore năd or country (line 130, verso 57). Dr. Fleet having told me that bo had good reasons for believing that tho name Kifudore donotos tbo Tungabhadra and that Mukkunde should be found somewhere on that river in the Nizam's territory, I sonrched the maps and havo found the place : it is in the "Sindunoortáluka of the Raichir District, and is shown as 'Mookoondi' in the Hyderabad Topographical Survey whout 83 (1880) and in the Indian Atlaa sheet 58 (1893), in lat. 15° 36', long. 76° 52', on the north bank of the Tungabhadrā; it is situated about twelve miles south-Houth-east from 'Sindunoor' and thirty-two miles north-hy-west from Bollary in Madras, and is about suventy-tight miles south-by-east from Yowar. This idontification of Mukkunde both oudorses the ideutification of the Kisudore with the Tungabhadra and also helps to locate the Eqedoro country; for somo furthor information on thuse points rofercuco may bo made to Dr. Floot's notos on pp. 293-295 below. Mukkuodo is mentiovod again in line 169, verse 82, where we learn that tho minister Ravideva obtained a gift of this village along with Gangāpura and Ehör froin tho Western Chalukya king Ahavamalla-Somnisvara 1, kod presonted them to the mombers of tho Brühunno family at slakkundo to which he hiinsolf belongod. Ehür, which is mentienod again in verses 94, 100, and linos 219, 243, is obviously the modern Yöwür itself. Gangapura may possibly be tho 'Gunga poor' of the Atlas sheet 58, in lat. 15° 5', long. 75° 56', on the north bank of tho Tungabliadrå, in thio Gadag talaka of the Dhürwär District, Bombay, about seveuty miles towara west-south-west from Mookoondi'; but the name is not an uncommon onc, and this ilentifiration is only conjectural. Miriñje (1. 227) is the presont Miraj, the chief town of the Miraj Ntate in tho Sonthern Marathi Country, Bombay, about twonty.oight miles inst-by-north from Kölhäpär. Wo find mention likewise of Kiriya-Bollumbatti in the Nariyumbole seronty (11. 229-30, 249) and Piriya-Beļļumbatti in thu Sagara three-hundred (11. 233-4). Régizling Sagara see just below. Nariyumbole may bo safoly identified Frith tho‘Nurriboli' of the Atlas short 57, on the south bank of the Bhimā, about twenty-seven miles north-east from Yowür; nud une or the other of the two Bollumbattisa--probably Piriya, tho"larger, senior, or oldor" onomis tho · Bollubutti' of the maps, four milos north-north-enst from Yowir. Ag re garila Sivapura, on tho west of Piriya-Belsubatti (11. 233-5), the maps ghow a Shewapoor about ono mile null a half on the north-east of Bellubntti'; but this does not seem to answor to tho Sivapura of the record : there is, howovor, nothing Apocial about the naine Sivapura; it might be given to any small suttloment, and the place could aftorwards dovolop into & village. As for Elaravo (11, 230, 249, 251), Dr. Fleet tells me that an inscription of A.D. 1095 at the place itsolit shows that this is tlo modern Yedaravo, a villago about ten miles towards the rorth north-west from Yowtir which is shown in the Llyderabad Survey shoot 78 (1885) AR 
Yedilurawi,' bot in the Atlas sheet 57 as 'Yoddura' with a careless omission of the last syllable. On the subject of tho Sagara three-hundred (1. 233) Dr. Floot makun the following remarks: --" This ancient territorial division is connected more or less directly with tho present Bagar,-tho Suggur' of the Atlas abeet 57 and the Survey wheet 79,6. now a jdgir town in the Shāhpir (Shawpoor') tālaka of the Gulbarga District, about fifteen miles towards the

south-east-by-cast from Yowir. At the same time, the maps show close on the north-east of 
Shawpoor,' which is about five milos towards the north-east-by-north fron Sagar, a village named 'Hulli Suggur,' which seems to mean II:a!o-Sagar, "OH Sagar"; and tho Survey sboet shows also & ' Suggur Droog,' or "Sugar hill-fort," among the hilly close on the month-west of 
Shawpoor.' Accordingly, and in view of the point that the name Shāhpir jg ovidently of late origin, the ancient Sagara should perhaps be located whore Shāhpār is now. The Sagara territory in epocified ng a three-hundred district in the Kembhävi inseription of A.D, 1054 (p. 292 below), in the presont Yowar inscription B of A.D. 1077, and in tho Yowör iuscription C of A.D. 1105: but it is mentioned as a five-hundred district three times in an inscription of A.D, 1129 ut Hiru-Mudinir, about twolve miles towards the south-west from Yownr, and again in an inscription of A.D. 1218 at Chikka-Mudanir, next door to Hira-Mudanür.It thus seems to have received an increase of oxtent at somo time about A.D. 1110-20, through an absorption of the wholo or part of somo adjucent district or listricts, lying probably on the east of the original threo.hundred." 
As was said above, tho stono which hoars this inscription contrins also two short separate records. One of these is at the bottım of the front face, the other at tho foot of the second side-face. The language and script of both are Kanaroso; their date is later by few years than that of the main record. Thoy aro as follows:

TRANSLATION. 
Lines 1 to 104, containing vorges 1 to 51, follow mostly a draft which has been anfficiently dealt with in connection with the record on tho Nilgunda plates (see p. 142 above). But in addition to the punning verse Vikhyāta-Krishna-varnné, No. 37 in that record and No. 40 in this one, wo havo hero another one of the same kind, Adoshākara-saingowpi, No. 39, which is not in the Nilgunda record. 
The point of this stanza is a comparison of the king with the god Siva. In its literal sense it means w." Though ho was in contact with a woalth of flawless [enjoyments], and though he did not outrage any religious rites, he, being adorned with excellont majesty, obtained the empire of the world." Secondarily it signifios :--" Though ho wore no moon [on his brow, as does Siva], and though he broke up no saorifices (as Siva broke up Daksha's sacrifice), yet he became a jagad-ida (Siva), wearing oxcellent bhūti (majesty or white ashos)."

NOTES BY Dr. FLEET. 
1. Kombhāvi inacription of A.D. 1064. About twelve milos south-wont-by-south from Yowūr there is a village named Kombhavi, having five inscriptions. One of them, the only important ono, is at a temple which is now known as the temple of Siddhesvaru : it is of interest in connection with the Yowiir inscription 
A, odited by Dr. Baructt at p. 268 abavo. 
This record rofors itself (lines 1-7) to tho reign of the Western Chalukya king Train lokyamalla-(Sõmēśvara I), who was reigning at the uoloridu of Kalyäpa. It thon gives (II. 8-16) to verses which present the following short pedigree :--Chanda (1), "a leuder amoug kings (raj-ägrani);" his son Nimba; his son Allapuli; his oldor brother Chanda-bhüpalnka (II), "& sun in tho sky which is the lineage of Ayyaņa ;" and his son Müvadi-ganda. Then, reverting to prosc, it introduces (11. 16-24) the Mabã mandalesvars Rēvarasa. luits do Hcription of him it repeats tho biruda Müvadi-ganda (11. 17. 18), thus identifying limity tho son of Chavda II, and also stylos him Ummuni-kornkamiga.juludhi-buda.rīlu, "a submarino tiro to the ocean which is Mummuni of the Końkan" (l. 22), perhaps with reference to somo hostilitios with the Silābāra prince Mummuni or Mäivåņi, for wlion we have a dito in 
A.D. 1000. It also gives him the hereditary titlus of Mihishmati-purikurslarie "lord of Māhishmati a best of towns" (1.17), and kõritariryyat-hna-iluk," foreliend-ninrk of the family of Kartavirya," (1. 19). This last title takes here the place of the thir/1l-lllis odbharu of the Yöwir inscription A : but it means the same thing, as Kärtaviryu was a usmu of Arjuna, a priaco of tho Haihayas, who was killed by Parasurama;' and it thus gives the explanation of the name Ahihaya as another form of Haibaya. 
It thou tells us that Rövarasa's wife was Māļiyabbarasi (1. 41); and that she established & god named Malibośvara (1. 43.44), and unde granth to it, beginning with one thousand muatturs of arablo land (lry) in the eastern fiolua of tho rajadhāni Kombūvi," and including

i This name means "the red well."

Chalukin um Rüshatrukun dominions, and to their settlemcut there. 
There seems to have been quite a group of these local Ahihayas in the Gulbarga District. Otlier branches of the “ Ahihaya lace" and "the lineago of Ayyaņa" aro mentioned in other mi corils from that locality.

This tells us that:- "On tho sonthern bank of the Kirudore, at the ominont site Muttür of Kuruvatti, the saint Guñagalladova founded a place which the world knows well as a Siddhatirtha (u sacrod resort of pious peoplo]." 
Now, it seemed not unreasonable to expect to find usuvatti somewhere near Tumbigere and losaluniada, both of which places are close to the Tungabhadra, within six Iniles on the cust of it ; and the Tangabhadra is the only river of any iviportanos in that neighbourhood which could bo regarded as buving anywhere a south bank. 
But further, a Balagāmi inscription of A.1). 1068 tolls us that it was at Kuruvatti and in the Tungabhadrā that the Western Chūlukya king Abavamalla-Sõmēsvara I “by a supreme act of austerity asconded to heaven"; the reference being to the fact related in the Vikramūnkadoracharita, IV, 41-08, that tho king in quostion, buing attacked by a malignant sover for which no remedies were found to be of any avail, went to the Tuógabhadrī, and thero, after bathing and moditating ou Siva, walked into the river until its waters reachud his throat, and so ended bis owu liso. 
Everything being taken together, it could hardly bo doubted that the two inscriptions 
i tho samo Kuruvatti, and that consequoptly tho Kirudore must be the Tungabhadra. And I find Kuruvatti in a place which still exists ander the same name in the Harjauhalli tâlnka : it is shown in the Indian Allas sheet 42 (1827) as Heern Coornputty, 1.0. Hira-Kuruvatti, "the larger, senior, or older Kuruvatli," in lat. 14° 46', long. 75° 46' : it is on the Tungabhadră, at about seventeen miles due west of Harpanhalli and at the samo distance towards the north-wost from the placos Tumbigoro und Mosalemavu which have been mentioned above, and is a place of pilgrimage, with a fort and a temple of Siya which is said to bo a finc one. This place, iudeod, is on what is actually at that point the north bank of the Tungabhadra, which there makes a bend of about four miles from east to weat ; but that bank is in reality the south bank of the river with reference to its goncral course from south-west to porth-cast: however, the record of A.D. 1071 places on the south bank, not Kuruvatti itself, but * Muttür of Kuruvatti"; and this place may very well be identified with the Chik Koorwutty' of the mapy, on the opposite bank,--really the north one, but actually the south bank at that point. 
The identification of the Kifudore with the Tuhgabhadra, thas arrived at, is well confirmed by finding also Mukkunde, which is placod by tho Yöwür inscription B on tho Kisudore, in the Mookoondi' of the map on the Tungabhadră (sce p. 272 abuve). 
On this matter it only femailig to adıl thnt this Datino Kirudore," the little river," scems to have been applied to the Tungabhadrã by way of contrast with Perdore, Peldore, “the groat rivor," which is well known 48 a namo of the Kșishga, into which the Tungabhudrā fows about sixtoon miles north-north-easto Karnal in Alairas.'

There is nothing in oither of these two records to help to identify tho river; and it is possible, if not probable, that the paine here denotes somo other rivor than the Tungabhadra just as the name Beddore or Peddora Perdore, was also used to denote some river in Coorg which was at any rata not the Krishna ; seo Ind.

3. The Ededoro-country : the Raichir District. The identification (see p. 272 above) of tho Brihran village Mukkunde, which verso 57, linea 127-30, of tho Yēwir inscription B placos on the river Kirudoro and in the Edodoro nid, with• . Mookoondi' on the north bank of the Tungabbadrã in the Raichur District, is ouo guide towards locating tho Edodore country. 
Othor help in this direction is given by an inscription at Gobbür, it village in the Raichdr District, about eight miles soutli of the Krishpá, which is shown as Goboor' in the Indian Atlas sheet 58 (1893), in lat. 16° 18', long. 77° 13', abont fourtceu tuiles north-west-by west from Raichur and ifty-two miles north-uorth-east-ball-east from Mookoondi.' This record refers itself to the reign of Tribhuvananialla-(Vikramaditya VI), and is dated in A.D. 1084. It mentions as a foudatory of that king the Jithiimanduleśvaru Jāyimarasa, who was governing the Edodore two-thousand and the (P) Kallakelage hundred, and rocords that ho grauted to the god Kalidoviikvāmi of tho ugrohra Piriya-Gobhar a villago belonging to him, named Hallasinta, in the Guņdūru three-hundred. Thero is nothing in the record to show whether Gobbür was in the Ededoro two-thousand or in tho (2) Kallakengo hundred : nor doon auother inscription at Gobbür, of tho samo year, clear up this point. But the record seems to imply that the place was in one or the other of then : and it must natur ally be understood that tho two districts woru adjacent to cach other, 
And still another indication is givon by the record on the Miraj plates of Jayasimha ll, dated in A.D. 102, which recites that the king, when he was in camp noar Kollipara (Kolbäpör) after “baping thoroughly routed the mighty Chola, the lord of the lire Dramila conntries," granted to a Brahmaụ, who was born at the villago Murunira in the Pagulaţi district, & village named Madadājhoru in the Karatikallu three-hundred which was in the Edadoro (sic) two-thousand. As will be shown below, pp. 306 ff., l'agalati is l'epirsenter now by a villago iu tho Gulbarga District which is shown us 'Ilugurtungeo' in thu Atlas sheet 58 and as · Haggatagi' in the Hyderabad Surycy sbect 53 (1909), situated about twenty cight miles south-west-by-south from Yöwür; and Nudnuita is tho modern Ilire and Chikku Mudapñr, sixteen miles north-east-by-north fronn Hugartungoe' and twelve miles south west-half-south from Yöwir. Tho village Dladadnjutru still remains to ho found. But, in view of the othor indications, there can be littlo doubt, if any, that Karaţikallu is a police shown as Kurrudikul', which spolling we may safoly tako un meaning Karadikal,s in the Atlag shoot 68 and tho Hyderabad Survey shcot 81 (1886), in the Raiobür District, in lat. 16° 9', long. 76° 31': it is oight or nine miles south of the Krishại and threo miles on tho north-west of the täluka town Lingsagăr, and is about forty-three miles towards west-by-south from Goboor' and tho samo distanco north-north-west-half-went from 'Mookoondi'.

Wcthun kee that the Edodore two-thousand was a stretch of country between the rivors Krishna on the north and Tungabhadră on the snuth, comprising a large part of the prosent Raichur District; probably, in furt, all of that district from about loog. 76° 15' to the confluence of the two rivers some kixty milos vant-by-Houth beyond Raichör. But it did not include the south-western part of Raichir: thero we have Yelbarga, the ancient Eramlara'e', which either was the chief town of it separate district of its own or else was iu tho Kisnkäd seronts,' and Itagi, a place note for an exceptionally fine Saiva temple, which Will in the Bulvola three-hundrod. The Koloro country took its name froin its position : the second component is of courte fore, 'a rivor'; the first is vde, 'n place, & spot, & place between'; and tho whole word means "(a territory) between rivors,"

4. Koppam : Khidrāpür. in verse 63, lines 139-41, of the Yowúr inscription B (wee p. 279 above) we are told that the Brāhman Sankarārya, un ancestor of the Dandaniya ku Ravidiva, by worshipping austerely Koppad - Távora, the god Siva as Isvara of Koppa, obtailiod a son whom bo accordingly named Krippactiva. With this, as an incidental fouel, compare the Ablir inscription E of alout A.D. 1:00, which recitos low Purushottannbhatta, the father of the famous Ekāntada.

State in the Southern Maratha Country, Bombay, and that Ahavamalla, hearing of that, met and foogbt bim at Koppam, but " became afraid, incurred disgrace, and ran away."i and a brief but vivid account of the battle is given in another of his records of the same year, at Manimangalam, dated precisely on 17 August, A.D, 1055. 
Two items of importance about Koppam are given in the records which thpa mention it. (1) One is that it was seppa-md-tirtta, “a proper great tirtha. "3 (2) The other is that it was on pôr-arras-garas, "the bank of the great river."* Here we have the Tamil karai, which is the Kanarese kare, bank, shore', and pēr-āsı, of which tbo Kanarese equivalont perdore, peldoro,' groat river', is well established as a name of the Kfishņā. 
We thus bave Koppam defined as a great tirtha or holy place on the bank of a great river wbiob we have good reason to take to be the Krishņā ; and the Tiruvallam inscription, quoted above, tends strongly to placo it somewhere near Kõlhāpūr, 
The olue to the rest is found in an inscription of A.D. 1213 at Khodrūpår, or moro properly Kbidrāpur, a villago which is shown in the Indian Atlus quartor-bert'10, S.E.

This record, also, las the account of the battle ; its historical introduction being the spino with that in the Manimanynim record mentioned above. The published toxt and translation of this latter record (South-Ind. Insert., Vol. Ili, pp. 60, 63) rive repp-arun-tiralla, "the strength (of whose position is) hard to doscribe"; the analysis being apparently keppu, 'to wpcak', with arun, difficult', and tiratta from tira the tailbhava of the Sanskrit sthira, 'firm, stouly': but the translatiou liere introduces something which is not in the text : and, as remarked by Dr. Barnett, with whom I have discours? these two passages, tepp-arun would ratlıor mean " rare in propricty or clegance". The expression #eppa-mă-fürita seems the inore likely ones compare seppa-ma-nadai, ' proper high conduct': and it is conceivable that it is the real ronding in the Manimangalam inscription algo.

• Sve above, Vol. V, p. 109, note 6); Vol. VI, p. 259.- Originally, in SouthIndtInsers., Vol. I, p. 134 (Kiel. horn'. No. 746), the roference to " the great rivor " was not understood; the translation was giveu es " Koppnu on the bank of the Përáru ;" and the suggestion was maile that the Pörāru inight be the lüliru, Pülür, and Koppam might be Kuppam, a village in the North Arcot District, Madrax, which gives its name to a statius op the Bangalore Branch of the Madras Railway. Then, in South-Ind. Inscra, Vol. II, p. 232, the trauslution was corrected into “ Koppam on the bank of the big river;" and the suggestion was made that the referenco might be to the Tuógå snd Koppa, & tåluka town in the Kadür District, Mysore. But, oren apart from the objectiun that neither on Kuppan be said to be exactly on the Pălăr nor Koppa on the Tunge, these two places are of ao importance from any point of viow, oncept that one of them happens to give ite name to a railway station, and the other was made in 1897 the hend-quarters of a taluka, Another suggestion has been (Epi. Curt., Vol. IX. Bangalore, introd., p. 16, note 8; and Mysors and Coorg from the Inscriptions, p. 90) that Koppam may be " Kopal, Kopana", by which is meant Koppal, in the south-west corner of the Nizain's territory, about reven miles north of the Tusgabhadri : in this case there is not ayon an identity of name to give colour to the idos. It may be added that koppa, 'a small village', is by no means an uncoin inon danno of placca in the Kanarese country': It also ocopn frooly u an ending of place-Dames ; c.g., Bömankop, Chikkop, Dövlkop, Gorindkop, Hirökop, eta

1136 (curront), in the month Chaitra, on a Monday (Somavira) which was a surya-parvan or solar festival; and the corresponding English date is Monday, 22 April, A.D. 1213, the new-moou day of Chaitra, on which day there was a total eclipse of the sun, visible in Lodia, The record recites that on that day the Devagiri-Yadava king Singhapa gave "thọ village Kudala-Dāmavādey situated at the confluence of the rivers Kodala Krishnaveni and Bhönası and in the Mirimji country, up to its boundary (starting) from the holy confluence of the rivors. Kțishnavēņi and Kuvont, krimad-idya-stayanibhurā sri-Koppasvara-dēvaya, “ to the holy first solf-existent one, the holy god Koppasvara :" also, that he repaired and gave to that samo god "all that is found from provious times at the two villages Jūgula and Siriguppa." 
Now, the tomple at which the stone tablot bearing this inscription stands is still koown as the tomple of Koppēsvara. It has not exuotly the architectural pretensions with which in niy inexperience I creditod it nearly forty years ago : and it sooms in fact to have been built on the site of an earlier temple of the Chålukya period. Still, it is a great and note worthy building. With it and the inscription taken together, ospecially in view of the description of the god as “the holy first self-existont one," it can hardly be doubted that the god of this temple is the original and great Koppēšvara. And in the light of all the points het ont above we cannot hesitate, in my opinion, to tako this god is the Isvara 'of Koppa mentioned in the Yowor inscription B, and to place here, at Khidrápur on the Krishna, the “ great tërtha Koppam on the bank of the great river," which was the scene of the battle between the Cholas and tho Chűlukyas. 
1 may add that in my opinion this same record enables us to identify Küdalsangam, the scono of anothor Chola-Chalakya battlo, with tho confluence of the Ksishņš and the Panchgavyā; also, that I locate in the same neighbourhood, at Iñchal-Karanji, the place Karandai, which was still another of the same series of battle-fields. Tbese points, however, m11st be dealt with in a more detailed note on another occasion.

with ink-impreunions, sqneezes and photographs, and I have to thank him for references and suggestions so that my part has been merely to reconsider the reading and translatioa of the inscriptions. 
• Arome On the bronzo ongket from Mäpikiala. Tho caskot, whioh is' of bronzo, was found in a stapa at Månikla, a village and group of ruins some twenty miles south-east from Rawalpindi (Imp. Gag., XVI p. 182), and it discovery is described in Prinsep's Essays, Vol. I, pp. 96 f. (with illustrations Nor. 200 and 205 in the plats annexod thereto) and by Cunningham in the Archeologioul Survey of Indithi Vol. II (1871), pp. 161-62, where it is called a cyliader. It is now in the British Museum, . 
• The castet in cylindrical, 5.3 inches (135 mm.) high and 3.5 inches (90 mm.) in diameter, with a pinnaclo 3-5 inches (90 mm.) high on its lid. Around on the top of the lid runs the insoription, in Kharoshthi characters formed of small dots punched into the motal as in some other cases, and the last four lotters are inscrted, because of want of room in the ragin line, beneath the procediog word, but the space is hardly largo enough for the proper delineation of their lower portions. Fig. A, I, on the annexed plato, is a roducod reproduction froin 2.photo grupla taken from above the lid, and displays the record as it lies on the lid, excopt that it fails to show the lower portion of the last letter. Henco fig. A, II, which is a full-size reproduction from an ink impression, has been uilded; the gap in it was niin voidable because of the sloping shape of the lid. I have inspected the casket and compared the two illustrations with the inscription.

REMARKS, Kavosia. The doubtfal letter is the second. It soons to be vo rather than vi, because the vowel sign does not extend above tho v, except in ono dot ; compare this sign with the e-sign in the next letter si. Even if read as Kanisia, tho word cannot mean “ belonging to the towni Kapisk ", for two reasons : (1) if it is so taken, the donor would not montion his name, but merely call himself "Satrap of Kapida " ; and this is wholly improbable, becaux donors alwupo mentioned their names, and naturally 80 :- (2) le meutions his father's name, Ganakpvaka, and it is not credible he should do that and yet not montiou his owu name.

mast therefore be the donor's name ; and even if Kavitia be derived from the town Kapiba, it must still be a personal name. 
Granakpvaka, Tbe first letter has the mark of conjunot r, but the q may not be real and may merely modify the sound of the g, se on the Wardak vase (Ep. Ind. Vol. XI, pp. 206-7) : that is its forou here probably, beorune it oocars in the initial letter. The difficult letter is the third. It consists of throe portions, (1) the letter k with the extremity of ite right limb curved and extended in (2) a long straight line upward, and (3) the letter p subsoribed beneath the k. The meaning of stroke (2) seems probably v, which, when conjunot, is formed by a curvedstroke carried up to thr top of the lotter; corapare svara in line 1 of the Måpikiāla atonel and sitrana in 1.3 on the Wardnk vase. The whole character seems therefore to denote kpv, and I would suggest that the name is Ganakpuaka, the v representing the vowel u before a as required by Indian writing. just as Puru-depa becomes Purvaspa in line 2 of the Mäpikidla stono, Thon hore in a dental », hucause it is exactly like the n in dana. 
Dana-mukho. I agree with M. Senart in this reading. The expression oocars in other inscriptions and also in the form dana-muhe on the Bimarãn vaso, as he has noticed, pointing out that mukho involves change of gender in this Prakrit. He explains the phrase es "moyen, Ohjet d'an ione" and is zilano, But it seems to me it most mean more than that. The entire gilt consisted of n copper box, inside that thix bronze casket, inside it five modals and / gold box, 
nii iusido that two gold coins, a silver disc and somo fragments. The three boxes, or at least tho bronzo and gold boxes, obviously coustituted ono gift, and this bronze box or casket, which alone 1w11:9 an inscription, would by itself have beon a shabby gift from a Satrap; hence it seems pirobablo tbut the two gold coins and the fragments were also part of the same gift, the diso being separato (sco the next inscription). Other places where dina-mukhe occars are discussed in the Annual Report of the Archwological Survey of India for 1903-4,5 where it appears only in three instancos, clearly on tho Chārsadda pedestal (ibid., pp. 249-50) and probably in the inscriptions marked Nos. 4 and 9 (ibid., pp. 253-4). It seems to mo at present that dana-mukho is a nominative case and that it denotes something more than dana. I do not however think we have sufficient material yet to enable us to speak with any certainty about its moaning. So far as regards this casket with its contouts and the Bimaran vaso (which contained relics of Buddha) it may be suggested that, as muklu means “ He chiof, principal, best", dana-mukha may Dieau "a choice gift", "a precious gift ", being applied to gifts of special value as distinguished from ordinary gifts. Compare the use of the word mukhya, which is often added to nonns in Sanskrit to signify "pro-ominont, choico "'; e.g. dvijati-nıukhya, Manu III, 286; ratha-mukhya, “a choice chariot," Väyu Purāna 93, 19. 
B. On the silver plate or disc from Māņikidla, The plate or disc was found inside tho bronze casket as mentioned above, and the references for it are the same as for the casket. It is figurod as No. 26 in the place in Prinsep's Essays and also in Cunningham's plate. It is of silver, .9 inches (22 mm.j in diameter, and the inscrip tion is on one sido, firmly engraved in Kharoshthi characters, as shown in fig. B in the annexod plate, a full-size reproduction of an ink-impression. It is now in the British Museum and I have carefully compared it with this reproduction.

FOUR EARLY INSCRIPTIONS. 
801 
The first line is clear, Gomanasa ; but the second is diffionlt, and the whole is so brief that it offers soant means of testing the value of the fourth letter in it, the really puzzling letter. It seems to me the only olue to decipher the inscription lies in the oironmstances. Gomanasa is the genitive of Gomang, that is, Gomāna, a name comparable with other names formed from go such as Godhara and Gonanda. This disc was his gift, while tho caskot and the gold cylindri. oal box inside it wore tho gifts of tho Satrap Kavosia. The diso was inside the gold box, and presumably both were given at the samo time. It is probable that the Satrap did not himself go to Māpikidla but sent his gift by the hand of some official; and if so, the deputy also might naturally offer a gift. Probably therefore Gomāna was the official so employed, and he presented this gift, patting it inside his master's gift which was sure of careful preservation. The second line therefore probably consists of his title. 
In the socoud line the first letter seems unquestionably ka, because its left leg is the main downward line. The second can hardly be dn, because da generally is not angular and has a short tail. It resembles du and ra, yet can hardly bo tu, becauso the stom of luis generally short. Hence it appoars to be ra. The third is plainly va. 
The fourth is very puzzling. Dowson read it conjucturally ag ria? and Cunningham accepted his conjooture, but the character for rta is woll known now and is different. It can hardly be vo. I have considorod all possible combinations of consonants but find none which seems tepable, and am constrained to think it is ka. It certainly differs from the preceding ka; yet if we place in regular order (1) the oldost form of k (Bühler's Table I, cols. in), (2) the first k hero, (3) this character, (4) thy later form of k (Büller's Tablo I, col. ris, and (5) the forni of k found ou the Wardak vaso in the undoubted words Sakya (1. I), kusala and Floveshkasya (1, 2),s we obtain a series showing the development of k, with two intermediato forms horo : and Dr. Thomas has found on tho Mathuri lion-capital form of ko in which tho k bas a resemblance to this fourth letter. Further, 4 closely parallol case of two differently formod ks will be found in MS. N. XV. 333;' namely, k's somewhat similar to tho first k here in korya khota (l. 1) and karyasa panchaka (1. 2), and k's somewhat similar to this second k here in the words righra karya (1. 5), katha karya and karaṇa twice (1. 6). 
The last letter is no doubt sa, though it differs from sa in the first line ; and since sa is written twice somewhat differently, so also might k be.

Hashtnagar, *the oight towns", is a tract of 303 square miles in the Chårsadda tahsil of the Peshawar district, the oight chief villagos of which are held to occupy the site of the ancient Pushkalāvati, Perkelaolis (Imp. Guz., XVIII, p. 60). Chūrsadda is on the north side of the Kuhul river, some 15 miles towards the N. E. from Peshawar. Pushkarävati (or Pushkalâvati) and Trikshasilá (Taxila) were both in the Gundhára country, and they aro said to have been the capitals of Puslı kara and Taksha rospectively, the two sons of Bharata, the younger brotèer of Ráma, king of Ayodhya. Gandhira than included Taxila, and this is also stated in Various places in the Jātaka. Hiuen-tuiang gives Po-lu-sha-pu-lo, Peshawar, as the capital of Gandhāra.

Senart pointed out that the tens and units: in the date wore 84 and tho month Fruthavadasa, (Journ. Asiat., VIII sório, Vol. XV, 1890, Parti, pp. 124-6). Bühler in 1891 adhered to the date as 274 Postavadasa, (Ind. Ant., Vol. XX, p. 394). But M. Sennrt subsequently fixed tho yoar as 384 (Journ. Asiat., IX série, Vol. XIII, 1899, Part i, pp. 530-1). The year-dato, however, has been called in question aguiu lately;' honce Dr. Fleet has had a caroful squeeze of the inscription made and reproduced as fig. C in the annoxed plate. I have compared this illustration with the pedestal itself, and it is quite accurato : the white lino along the middle is & photograpbio effect, due to a slope in the stone from tho upper part, which is more produinont, down to the lower part. 
The vedestal is 13.6 inches (534 cm.) long: but a portion of 28 inches (7cm.) has been broken away on the left sido, lonpipg only 10-8 inchos (27 cm.) intact. This portion with its insoription is shown in fig. O, but it is probable that there was more inscribed on the fragruent lost, 
The inscription is in Prakrit in voll cut Kharoshthi characters. I agree with M. Senart's reading of it. The yoar is undoubtodly 38h, and the month Proshavada, the second letter being th and not st (as shown in Bühler's Tablo I), for at has a complete cross-bar."

in his plato XX. The inscription is on its side, and is inoluded as No. 604 'in Prof. Lüders' List of Brahmt Insoriptions (p. Ind., Vol. X, Appx.). The box is now in the British Musena. 
The inscription is written in Brāhmi characters. It datas back to a timo before the serif or top-atroko had been developed in those characters: the letter ra, indeed, in line 2, geoms to have the serif; but its appearance is morely due to a break in the stone, for the squeeze shows clearly that the top of ra, just like the tops of all the other letters, was plain and had no sorif. 
The language is Prakrit. Savina (1. 1.) is no doubt a degenerate form of särvina (which is found on the Wardak vase), thu gonitive plural of survt, a fominine collective noun formed from sarva and meaning "the whole", and its use hero instead of the proper word savāna is worthy of notice. 
Cunningham translated tho insoription thus (loc. cit.): "Teacher of all branobes of Vinaya, the Aralst Kayapa Gotra, Upădiya (or Abbot); and the Arahat Vāchhi Savijaynta teacber of Vinaya," Prof. Lüders translated it thus (loo. cit.):-"(Rolics) of all teachors (vindyulons) beginning with Arao (Arbat?) Kāsapa-gota and Ara' (Arhat?) Vāchhi Suvijayata tho teacher." But the arrangemont appoars to me to show that each of the two porsons mentioned is described by, first, the title ara (which is no doubt short for uraha), secondly, his yötra-nawie, and thirdly, his personal name; hence upadiya must be a personal nawe, and eacīcihi seems obviously to be a gofra-name meaning "belonging to the Vātsya götru." Takon ko, tho whole inscription reads accarately, except that the final vindyaka should bo riniyakd, for this word obviously goverpe the first two words and applius to both persona.

IL Wathen in 1835, ia JRAS, first series, vol. II, p. 380; and a reading of the text, with a tradiolation, was givon by bin in vol. III (1836), p. 258.

He oould not offor a final treatment of it. The original plates have never been traoed again. But Dr. Birgens subsequently found ink-impres sions of thema, evidently made by Mr. Wuthov, in the Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society at Bombay. These he oventually made over to Dr. Fleet, who has now placed tben at my dis posal with a viow to the publication of a final critical version of this record in counectiou with the three similar opes mentioned farther on. The record, it may be stated, has no geographical connection with Miraj, except in having been found there; it registere the grant of it village at a long distance from that place : its most approprinto designation would be “tho Madadūjhūru grant": but the plates have been babitually known as the Miraj plates", and it is oonvoni. ent to retain that nume for them.

(VOL. XII, 
The plates were three in pamber, sach meandring about 114" in with by 84" bigle, and they were strung on & ring having & deal with the representation of a boar, the crest of the Chålukyas. The plates were made with rained edges to proteot the inscription on thom : and the writing is well preserved almost all through; so far, at any rate, that no part of the record is now doubtful. An apparent crack down the middle of plato ii 6 is not due to damage to the original plate : the ink-impressions were vory old and brittle, and this one was found torp down the middle; they were mounted on paper for subsequont presorvation ; but, even 80, they re mained very fragile, and quite recently, shortly before roprodaction, a small piece broke away and was lost, from this same side, ii h, causing the gap near the beginning of lines 65 and 66. 
The alphabet is a well-shaped one of the Northern type, resembling that of the Kauthor plates (Ind. Ant. vol. xvi, p. 21), with letters of an average height of about 1; its affinities are best Beon on plate 5 of Bühler's Palæographie.--The language is Sanskrit thronghout, with the oxcoption of tho Kanarono phraso gandarol-ganda on lino 60. Tho gerond nirddhilya (line 66). from the same root as the substantive dhūti, is worth noting.As regarde orthography, it may be noted that v is always written for b, and I have lost this spelling without correction in my transcription. There is considerable vacillation in the writing of consonants following r, which aro bomotimos left simple and somotimes doubled, and in respect of the nasals of tho third and fourth serios preceding consonants of the same groups, which aro sometimes mopresented by anusvara and sometimes givea in fall. The dental : is often confused with the palatal 4. Tho upadhmaniya breathing is in most cases represented by a letter resembling sh prefixed to a following initial p. 
The purport of the inscription is to record the grant of a village. Its first part (lines 1-61) is the well-known poom narrating the pedigree of tho Western Châlukya kinga, which is here carried dowa as far as the reign of Jagadēkamalla-Jayasimha II. I have already published a text of this composition in the recension of the Nilgunda plates, p. 142 ff. above, and there havo referred to tho variauts supplied by the presont document; it is therefore needless to doal furthor with the subject horo. The second part (line 61 to the end) is a deed of gift granting the village of Mādadājharu, in the three-haudrod of Karaţikalla and the two thousand of Ededoro, to i cortuin Vasudevārya, son of Rövaņārya and grandson of Sridhara, a Brahman of the Kausika Gotra and Balvřicha Sakhi, born at Mudunira, in the county of Paxalati. This is followed by the usual versos donouncing infraction of soch grants, etc., and a note recording the vame of the scribe, Māipnyyn, an official attached to the service of Prolärya, the Commander of the Forces and Curator of Records, 
The details of the date of this record (line 64-65) are : the Raktákshiq sa vatsara, saka 946 expired; the full-moon day of Vaisakha; Adityavára (Sunday). On this Dr. Fleet gives me tho following note :-“As a Chaitrādi lunar year according to the southern Innisolar systein of the cycle, the Raktākshin or Raktáksha sainvatsara coincided with tho Saka year 947 oor. rent (946 expired) also taken As A Chaitrādi year, and began on 13 Maroh, A.D. 1024. The given details answer quite regularly to Sunday, 26 April, A.D. 1024, on which day the full moon tithi of Vaisakha ended at about 15 hours 31 minutes after mean sunrine (for Ujjain)." 
In the tablo on the opposite page I give & concordance of the introductory verses in the four records of this class which have now been published, namely : 
1. The Kauthor plates of A.D. 1009; Indian Antiquary, vol. xvi, p. 21 : 2. The present Miraj plates of A.D. 1024 : 3. The Yewür inscription of A.D. 1077 ; p. 269 aboro : and 4. The Nilgunda plates of A.D. 1087 and 1123; p. 142 &. above. . 
Thore are two other records, on stone, which follow the same draft in the main. Of these one is the insoription of A.D. 1091 at Alür in the Gadag täluka of the Dhārwar Distriot, noticed by Dr. Fleet in Ind. Ant., vol. viii, p. 21; the other is an inscription of A.D. 1122 or 1123 at Davangere in the Chitaldroog District, Mysoro, of which s preliminary treatment bas been pablished in Tipi. Carn., vol. xi, Dg. 1. These remain to be examined in detail.

Note by Dr. Floot. The places mentioned in the record on the Miraj plates. Of the places mentioned in this record the first (line 66) is Kollapura, in the neigh bourhood of which city Jayasimba II was enoainped when he made the grant. Kollap is well known as tho earlier name of the present Kolhapur, the chief town of the Kolhapär State in tho Southern Marātbū Country, Bombay. 
Tho grant was made to a Brahman who was born at & village damed Mudunira which was in the Pagalați vishaya (line 67). The first step towards locating this district and village is made by means of an inscription at Tumbagi in the Muddebihåļ taluka of the Bijúpur District, Bombay, wluich village is shown in the Indian Atlas sheet 57 (1854) as 
• Toonbgco,' in lat. 16° 34', long. 76° 20', about twonty-one miles east of tho taluka town Bāgowädi in the same district, which is in the same Atlas sheet, and twenty milos towards north-east-by-orth from Muddebibāl, which is in sheet 58. The record refers itself to the tine of the Westorn Chalukya kiug Akalaúkacharita-Irivabedanga-Satyasrayadova, and is dated in tho Kwodhin sanatsarı, Saka 920 (oxpired), on the new-moon tithi of Ashādha, on the occasion of an eclipso of the sun : there details answor quito regularly to 20 July, A.D. 1004, on which day the given lilli ended at about 3 hrs. 20 min. after mean sunrise (for Ujjain), and there was an annular eclipse of the sun wlijoh sooms to have been partially visible in Southern India. It tells us that on that day a subject of tho king, tho Sotti Brahmayya, made grunts to tho yod Brulimuśvara at the agrahira Tumbige which was in the Pagalatti tbroe-hundred district, Thus, so far, wo learn that the Pagalaţi or Pagalatti district comprised throo hundred towns and villages, and included Tumbagi in, tbe Muddebibal täluka. 
Tho noxt step is taken by means of inscriptions at Hiro- and Chikka-Mudantir, two villages, contiguous to cach other, in tho Shoräpír or Surúpur täluka of the Gulbarga District of tho Nizam's territory: thoy are shown in the Indian Atlas sheet 57 (1854) ag'Hoore and Chicka Moodanoor', in lat. 16° 36', long. 76° 32', with only ono site for tho two villages, and in the Hyderabad Survey sleet 79 (1887), which is on the larger scalo (1=1 mile, instead of 15= miles), an ' Hccro Moodunoor', and Chikku Moodunoor', with separate sites, whioh, honovor, practically touch each other,-- Hirc-Maduniir being on tho wost. I have ink impressions of five inscriptions from Hire-Mudanar, and six from Chikta-Mudanjir. Ten of these aro datod, and range from A.D. 1099 to 1218 : these prosent tho earlior name as Mudinir. The remaining inscription is an earlier one, at Hire-Mudanir : this is only 
. 
· 1 The inscription is on a stone at the drinking-water woll of tho Matha. I quote it from an int-impression. An imperfect transcription of it is given in the Elliot Manuscript Collection, Royal Asiatic Society's Copy, Vol. 1, p. 17: the month is given there wrongly as Pushya, 1.e. Pauslis, and the game of the district as Pudala,

In the titlings of the transcriptions in the Elliot MS. Collection (see note I on p. 308 below this pataa is always given Muddanür, with the double dd. Following the mape, endorsed by the ancient nainte as found in the inscriptions, I have preferred to write it with the single d.

In none of thoun is the name given correctly in accordance with the original texts : the noarost approaches are, Madinir (short i in both syllables, twion) and Mudīnir (long i in both syllablet, once); other forins are Mudinůr, Mudinär, Madënor, and Muddatur, Thiotu i #ypical sample of one clans of the mistakes which have to be allowed for in wing the Collection la quotion.

fragment, consisting of parts of fourteen liues :1 the king'name and the date aro: lost; bat the record is markedly earlier than the others, and may be referred to about A.D. 1000. The recard gpeaks of the phace. in tho first extant line, as Srintat Mudunir, 
the fortanate Mudunir', and thus presents a form of the name whioh matches exactly the Mudunira (Sanskrit) of the record on the Miraj plates. Accordingly, Hiro and Chikka Mudanür being only thirteen miles east-half-north from Tambngi, which, dus we have seen, was in the Pagalatti three-hundrel, we find here the Mudunira in the Pagalaţi distriot which is mentioned in that record. The insoriptions do not distingaish between # Piriya and a Kiriya-Mudinir; whence it would seem that the growth of the place into the two separate sites now known as Hire and Chikka Madanår dates from after the opigraphio poriod. The change from the original dame Mudunir, first to Mudinir and then to Mudanar, geoms somewhat peculiar, but can only be accepted as & fact, without full oxplanation : 48 regarda, however, the first component of the name, Kittel's Kannada-English Dictionary gires mudi a8 another form of mudil, ndvanced age ; old.' As regards the expression the * fortunate " Mudunir, the place was ovidently a largo ono, la tho iosoriptious give the number of its Mahajanas, i.e. Brühmans, au live linndred ; they speak of it, from A.D. 1099, H8 an agrahara ; aud somno of thom style it "a Bonares of the South ", tho full description boing fri-Rāmu-datti sarvanamasyad=agraharain darkolint-Varanīši Audinir: this stands already in the record of A.D. 1099. The place is mentioned again, na Mudunira (Sanskrit) and as the home of a spiritual ancestor of tho grantco, in the Miraj plutes of the Silähära 
prince Marasimba of A.D. 1058.* 
The next step is taken by means of the unmo inscriptions at Hire- and Chikka-Mudanür. One of them, at Chikka-Mudanir', dated in A.D, 1009, records grants which wero mail to the god Kumāröśvara of the mülusthana, or original settlemont, after laving tho foet of the holārta of the god Ugru-Bhimiśvara of a plare the name of which it gives in line 21 as Hagaritage and in lino 45-6 as Hagalittage. And another, nt Hiro-Nfndapūr, dated in A.D. 1120, mentions two looal districts in specifying the tolls and lixos which wero assigned to it god nanol Blärkandesvara : these are, in lines 25, 27 and 34, the Sagara five-hundred, and in lines 29-30) and 33 the Hagariţtage three-hundred: 
Finally, the place thns mentioncil as Hagaritage, Hagaliţtago, and Hagarittago, anit marked as the chief town of a three-hundrod district, wo identify rasily quough with a villago of which the present name avems to be written indifferently as Hagarattagi, Iagariţige, Hagarittige, and Hagarittigi: it is in tho samo talaka of the Gulbargn District, and is situated bizteon miles towards south-west-by-wost fron Bire- and Chikka-Mladnnir, and is shown as * Hugurtungeo' in the Indian Atlas sheot 58 (1827), in lat. 16° 21', long, 76° 25', apd ng 'Haggatagi' in the Hyderabad Survey shoot 53 (1909).

place, ranging in date from A.D. 1061 (P) to 1940. They mark this place, also, as having boen an important one at that time ; describing it as an agrahara with five-hundred Mahajanas... And the inscription of A.D. 1240, which refers itself to the time of the Dövagiri-Yådava king Sióghana, montions & Mahapradhana and Bahattaraniyogadhipati Pärisasetti, the Barvadhikari of the Hagariţige' three-hundred- who had been "& supporter of the rule of Jayitapăla," 
a's father, Jaitagi 1. as taking part in the assembly before which the grants registered by the rocord were made. In connection with this place it may be added that the inscription of A.D. 1904 at Kalhole in the Belgaum District mentions & Mahamandalaivara Rāja II, of the Yaduvamsa, with the hereditary title “ supreme lord of Kapana & best of towos", as then ruling the Hagaratage nadu, and as having founded the Jain temple at Sindana-Kalpo!c, in the Kúpdi threo-thousand province, to which the grants were made. It is clear that in the Hugurtungee' and Haggatagi' of the maps we have the town Pagalatti, Pagalați, wbich gave its name to the Pagalatti three-hundred of the Tumbagi inscription of A.D. 1004, and to the Pagalati vishaya of the record of A.D. 1024 on the Mirai plates. The interchanges of p and h and of 1 and r are well known. Tho fipal ge (modern ge and gv) of the later form of tho namo is a common ending of placo-dames in the Kadarese country: it sometimes takes tho place of an original ka, or else is represented by kā in Sapskritizod forms, as in Palāśiki, Palasige, Halasige, Halsi; and it seems to have been some. times attached as an addition to earlior namos, and sometimes, as, for instance, in the change from Halasige to Halsi and in the alternative forms Kadambaļige and Kadambali (see note 8 on p. 293 abovo), to bave boon omittod as being of no partioular importance. The change in the vowel of the third syllablo, from the a of Pagalatti, Pagalati, to the i of Hagaritago. Hagalittage, Hagarittago, is perhaps due to the influence of the village.nama Ittage, Ittici which is fairly common in the Kanarese country. It may be added that from this place *Huggurtungee, Haggatagi', Tumbagi is fourtoen miles north-north-west, and Hire- and Chikka-Mudanâr are sixteen miles towards porth-east-by-north: Yêwór, which was in tbo Sagara three-hundred, is abcut twonty-eight miles north-east-by-north from the samo place. 
The village that was granted was situated in the Karatikallu three-hundred, which district was in the Edadore two-thousand province (line 69). The form Edadore stands here, as a result of the record being in Sanskrit and in the Nagari characters, for the Ededore which wo bave in line 128-9 of the Yower inscription B of A.D. 1077 (p. 279 above); the word means " (a territory) bet woon rivers ". I have shown at p. 295 above that the Idodore country, here specified as a two-thousand province, was a strotoh of country between the rivers Krishpá on the vorth and Tungabbadrà on the south, and consisted of a large part of the present Raichur District in the Nizam's territory ; probably, in faot, all of that district from about. 
* Not having ink-impressions of those records, I can only quote them, with renervation (wee noto 6 on p. 806 above), from the transcriptions in the Elliot Ms. Collection, vol. 1, pp. 308 , 490 b ; vol. 2, pp. 118, 119, 211, 8870, 374 : the last two are mero fragmenta ; the first of them prosente, as transcribed, the date of Bake 973 (expired). A.D. 1081-52, which may be questionable: the first reliable data is of A.D. 1120. The titling of the traducription. give the damo of the village & Hagariţige (three times), Hagariftigi (twice), and Hagariţtige (twice). The transcriptions represent the original records as giving the forms Hagarittage (once), Hagaritage (or.ce), Hagarit tigo (twice). Hagariţige (threo times), and Hagariţtoge (once). Those forms, of coorde, cannot be vyoched for (see remarks iu poto 8 on p. 306 above) in my opinion, we may certainly reject the form with o in the pepultinanta syllablo; and I doubt very inach whether any of tho original records can really prosent an in that uma syllable. 
• The inscription of A.D. 1240 Boems to represent it as . Pandava-datti (but what the transoription actually kivon is Panduvadantti) : compare the expressions Rama-datti and Janamajaya-datti : mae p. 807 above, and note 3. 
* JBBRAS, vol. 10, pp. 282, 235, PSOCI, No. 95. The name Hagaratage was written clearly here with the single t; perhaps to suit the metre. In tho mentiou of the town Kupaps, the reference is prolmbly to the proment Kopal, Koppal, in the extreme south-west corner of the Nigam's territory.

long. 76° 18' to the confluence of the two rivers some sixty miles east-by-south beyond Brichar. It may be said again here that we can see, now, that this Ededore country (and dat, es bad boon supposed, the small Yedatore talaka on the Kåport in the Mysore Distriot) is the Idaitarai-nidu which the Chola king Rājöndra-Chola I, whom Jayasimha II defeated, had been proud to include among bis conquests. The grant registered by the record on the Miraj plates was made by Jayasimha just after “having completely routed the mighty Chola," and was evidently made as an item in the celebration of his having won back the province which the Cbola king had wrested from the Chalukyas some eight or nine years earlier. 
As to the Karaţikalla three-hundred district, there can be little doubt, if any, that its chief town Karatikalla is a place which is shown as Kurrudikul' in the Indian Atlas sbeet 58 (1827) and in the Hydorabad Survey sheet 81 (1886), in lat. 16° 9', long. 76° 34'.8 The place is in the Liigsugar tāluka of the Raiohir District, and is eight or nine miles south of the Krishna and three milos on tho porth-west of Liigsagår. We may safely take the spelling given in the maps as meaning Karadikal; especially in view of the point that the name is given an Kararikul' in the Map of the Nizam's Dominions (1892 ; 116 milos). The which we have in the name as given in the Miraj record would easily be softened into the d which is indicated by this last spelling of the vamo, taken with the othor: or it is even possible that the writer of the record oonfused tho Kanaroso karadi, 'a bcar', with the Sanskrit karati(n), an elephant', which would be more familiar to him. The Karadikal which is mentioned in an inscription of the Chola king Virarājöndra I is probably the samo place. 
The village that was granted was Madadäjhůru, in the Karatikalla throe-hundred (line 69); and it was bounded by the following villagos : on the east, Jālibiļu (line 71); on the south, Unahalli (line 72); on the west, Vavvulikhēta or Babbulikhēta ; and on the north, Govanti. These places cannot be located at present with any certuinty. But it is quite possiblo that Jalihidu is the *Jalihal' of the maps, a large place in lat. 16° 22', long. 76° 50', about four miles south of the Krishại, and twenty-three miles towards north-east-by-east from 
• Kurrudikul'. The name Jalihal' can only mean Jālihāļ, "tho būbul-troe wasto land", from jali, 'the thorny båbul tree, & oacia arabica', and hal, hūlu, originally hal, halu, 'waste land. An older form of the lattor word is pal, with the variant pātil. And the d in the Jálikādu of the rocord could easily come from tho of patu; or equally from the l, l, of hal, hal, halu. This identification, however, can only be put forward as a conjectare ; because the other village-names cannot be found there, aby more than anywhere olse, and it is hardly safe, in such & case, to rely too much on only one name out of several. But Jalihal boing, as bas been said, a large place, it may possibly have absorbed the lands of the other four villages, and their names may have thus disappeared

Mandasor, as is well kuown, is the sito of tio ancient city of Dastupura. T'ho stouo. slab bearing the record was turned up by the plongh in a small hanilot close to Mandnsor, on the banks of the river Siwana. It was removod hy its (liscoveror Mr. Jaya-Saúkarn to his own residence in Mandagor, but subsoquently, the Subba or Governor of Mandngnr, suspecting that to be inscription contained some information about hiddcu treasure, and it romoved to his owo residence. There I fonnd it in October 1912. The Govornor vory kindly allowed me to osana ide the slab and to rompyo it to Mr. Jaya-Sarkara's house where I was staying. At that time I rond the whèle of the inscription from the stone itself. Mr. Jaya-Sankara had giyon ino an impression of it, but as it was not very clear, I requestod Sir John Marsliall, Directora General of Archæology in India, to got some botter estawpages for mo. At his royuust dir. D. R. Bhandarkar, Soperintendent, Archeological Survoy, Wusteru Cirgle, sent two oxcellent inked impressions to me in Aprü 1918, ono of which is reproduced here.

The following orthographical peculiaritios may be noticed. All consonants with a super fcript r have been doublod, e.g., Jayavarnına-, l. 4 ; pārtthirē, l. 5, etc., but consonants with a subscriptr bare not always been doubled; cf, vikranta-, 1. 5; but Salkrasya, 1.2; -vikkrama. 1. 4. In some cases the antsvāra las buon used in plucos where thero ought to have been sandhi, 7.9., malankṣitā and painchamyūms, 1. 3; -89 nbhāra., 1. 6; n has been usod thrice in the place of the unusrara, viz., in Sinhavarmmanus-, aod -siniharikrāntuo, l. 5, and Saranan-gutah, 1. 7. The word sri, whouever usod iu Sanskrit as tho first part of a corapoond word, either in inscrip tions or in litorature, is usod without villakti. Sometimes it is used as a separate word with thu third caso-ending, mcaning suha or yukta, hut in the prosent inscription it is used in the first cuno-ending, as in srir-Amülavan, 1. l; sriranimahāraja., l. 5, In tho last caso, however, its use is optional. 
The languago is Sanskrit and tho whole of it, with tho exception of the word siddham at the beginning of lino 1, is in verse. There are a few mistakos due to tho mason's carelessness, e/.. -ziduudīpa- for •ridyndilipa. in l. 6; prarsik-kalë for prāvril-kālē in l. 2; Juyamit[rlayah for Jayamitrāyah in l. 9, aud svakulusy-atha for svakulasy-atha in 1. 8. 
The characters of the inscription belong to the Central Indian variety of the Southern alphabot which is said to bavo closely agrood with the Western variety of the same alphabet in its simplest form. The most important common characteristics of the Southern alphabet are to be found in this inscription : 
(1) la, phi, sha and sa are opin at the top. Da alwnys has the ancient form. Tho ya 
is tripartite in all cases, with tho exception of prak-puny-öpachay-, l. 4, where it 
is bipartite. 
· (2) The long vertical stroke of the right limb of lu is always retainod and moreover it is 
in all ensen, bent towards the left. (3) The medial și is shown by a curlod carve to tlıoʻleft. Besides these, the following particulars aro to bo obsorvod : 
(1) A, which occurs once, bus a loop at tho bottom, cf. Asvoja- in l. 3. Tho medial a is 
placed somowhat lowor down than usual in two cases, víz. Asvoja., l. 3, and 
-naruhusrõran, I. 7. (2) Medial ( is expressed both by a loop and a curve to the left. (3) Initial i occurs only once in idrik- in l. 4. The medial form is oxpressed by a double 
curve; cf. srir, l. 1. (4) Modial is cxprossed in three differont Ways 
(a) Tbe usual one consisting of a hook turned towards the left and attached to the 
bottoin of letturs, e.g. in -samudra-, l. 1; pushpair, 1. 3. (U) A curve to tho right attacbod to the bottom of the lettor, whioh ends in a 
vertical line rising to the full height of the letter, e.g, in -suklasya, 1. 3, aud 
duhitura, l. 9. (0) A curve to the left attached to the bottom of ra, rising upwards and intersect 
ing the vertical limb of the consonant; e.g. in -charu., 1. 7; -käruņikah, ], 9. The only exception is the form in purushays, I. 1.

The rooord refors itself to a king named Naravarman, who was the son of Sinhavarman and the grandson of Jayavarman. This Naravarmun is mentioned in the Gandhär inscription of his son Visvavarman of the Alälava year 480, and Visvuvarman again is roforrod to in the inscription of his son Bandhuvarman, who was a contemporary as well as the feudatory of the Emporor Kumāragupta I. In the Susania rock inscription of Chandravarman,' wo find that the name of Chandrayarman's father was Sinhavarman. It is spolt osuctly in tho mano way is in tbis inscription, i.e., Sirhararman and not Siikavurman or Sirylararman, A compari son of the alphabets of the two inscriptions shows that thoy bolong to tho samo historicul poriod and can only be separated by a very few years, Up to this day epigra have generally rogarded the Möharauli pillar iosoription of Chandrat as being record of tho carly Gupta Emperor Chandragupta II. I think tho Susuniå inscription and thu now Manda Hor inscription huve part a new complexion on tho stato of affairs. In tho Susuniñ rock inscrip. tion we find a king named Chandruvarınan, tho son of Sinhavarman, of the city of Pushkarana, dedicating one of the insignia of Vishnu, viz., & wheel.

Varman-kings of Malaya. By the help of the newly discovered inböription we oun pot up the following genealogy of these rulers of Mālava : 
Jayavarman 
Sinhavarman 
Naravarman : 
Visvavarman 
Bandhu varman. The Sanqnia inscription connects Chandravarman .with this dynasty and we have the following completo genealogy : 
Jaya varnan 
Siöhavarman 
Chandravarman (a contomporary of Samudragupta). 
Naravarman V. S. 461=404-5 A.D. 
Visvavarman V. S. 480423-4 A.D. 
Bandhuvarman; V. 8. 493 
436-37 A.D. The Meharanlı pillar inscription mentions a king named Chandra who had conqu Vablikas aftor crossing the seven mouths of the Indua, and the Vangas. Nowhore in & Gupta inscription do we find any mention of any conquost of the Punjab or of Afghanisthan by Chandragupta II., or any other successor of Samudragupta Tho Susania inscription supplies us with a king named Chandra with the family title Varman, who belonged to. Pushkarana in Western India, but bad dedicatod a wbeel of Vishnu close to the Vanga country. The Moba rauli pillar itsolf is the very dhvaja, another ensign of Vishnu, the dodioation of which is recor in the inscription itself, aud it also speaks of a conquest of Bengal. The natural conclusion is to state that Chundra of the Mebarauli pillar inscription and Chandravarman, son of Simha varman, of the Sasuuiâ inscription, are ono and the same person. In the former record the family name was omitted in ordør to satisfy the needs of the metro. 
Hitherto the Bijayagadh pillar insoription has boon regarded as the oldest known insorip. tion of the Mālava-Vikrama Era, though the era used has not been specifically named. So the

SYNNE AN 
earliest epigraphical mention of the name of this er is to be found in the new insoription in the following words: 
Srir-mmalava-gan-īmnātë prasaste krita-samjhitë. 
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar has commented on this line at length in a paper contriba tod to tho Indian Antiquaryl which appeared before my paper in which tho discovery of the inscription was announced. . I am afraid I am not able to agrea with his conclusions. In the first place he says that the word amnīta means "authoritatively laid down", but tho word amnāta is dorived from the root mnd, to repoat. Thorofore amnita means 'repeatedly usod'. The word ämndya from the same root means the Vödas, which are constantly repeated. Bunuimniya and Sandmatitu ocour in the beginuing of tho Nirukta, which is rogarded as a sort of commonlary on the Nighanţa, which always precedes the former. The phrases mean that whioh is to be learnt by heart. The question of authoritativonoss is to be derived from the context and not from the word. 
In the second place ho takes the word gann to moau a boily politic or corporato body, for which I am afraid thero is no warrant of so ancient it date. Gana, pūga, niyama or sungla always done a congregation or collection, and I am afraid thoro is nothing in anciunt litera. tare ta connoct it with a political body, 
The word sthiti has not boon used in this inscription but it has been used in conjunction with the word yung in (wo other Mandasor iuscriptivns, viz.-- 
(1) Bandhavarman's inscription of the poor 493. (2) Yasodharman's inscription. Sir Ramnkrishnu takes it to menn " the formations, 
“tha condition" or "the constitution". But stili usually moans convention or tacit consent, and this is supported by the phrago gurut-sthitrovusīt tilajñüretī ija likhitishu, 1.0., written for tho koowledge of the time owing to the tacit consont of tho gana or congregation of the Mūlavas. Kālajñānīyn moans for fixing tho 
dato. Varis hero means owing to. Both Sir Ramakrishna and Mr. D. R. Dhandarkar have taken krila ay anothor name of all the yoars of the era used in this inscription. Krila is, lorover, the name of tho first year of il cycle of years, which was used in tho Vedic Poriod. Now this Vedio cyclo seoms to have been continued in uso in the coar try surrouuding Mandlasor in the 5th contury A.D., though Mr. Shamebustry Asserts that it had gone out of use in the 12th century B.C. The word has beon found in threo inscriptions : 
(1) The Bijayagadh pillar of Varika Vishộuvardhana, the year 428. 
The new Mandasör inscription of the year 461. (3) The Gangdhår inscription of Visvavarman of the year 480. 
Our supposition that the yoar krita is tho first yoar of a oyole of four years, becomes tenable if tho year of the Malave-Vikrama era to which it is applied, is divisiblo by four aftor tho sabtraction of one. Now this is 10 in two casos out of throo, In the new Mandagðr iuscription the number of years are divisiblo by foor after the deduction of one. The date of the Gangdbir insoription is an expirod year, as is indicated by the words yātēshu and sottarapüdē. shu ; yatëshu moans expired', and sõttarapīdēshu maos 'when one quarter had expirod', and

this last hans been onnitted by Dr. Fleet in his translation. So the real date of the Gangdbär inscription lies in the year 481 of tho Málava-Vikrame ette. This number is divisible by foar after the dedaction of one. The year of the Bijayagadh pillar inscription is the exception. Here the number of years are not divisible by four after the subtraction of one. But most probably this also is an expired year though it is not so specified. 
A Jaina work, the Bhagavatt Satra, however, states that the four Yugas come in the following order : Kali, Dudpara, Trēta and Krita. If a particular year i:. divisible by four then it is a Krita yoar. 
Sir R. G. Bhandarkar is of opinion that the era used in this ipsoription was founded by the Malava Republican body. Mr. D. R. Bhandarkari states that “ the Milavas were only in possession of a traditional usage regarding, i.e. of a mode of reckoning, the Krita year ". Dr. Ficeto thinks that the Malava Vikrama era was founded by the Kushaņa Emperor Kanishki. They all proceed on the supposition that thore was no sach king as Vikramaditya bofors Chandragnpta II. of the Gupta dynasty. In this connection I beg to point out that & king namerl Vikramaditya. is montioned in Hilas Saptatati, V. 64 (od. Weber, nr. 464). As Hila cannot be placod later than the 1st century A.D., it maakt be admitted that the Vikramaditya mentioned here must have existed in the first centary B.O. The verso runs as follows:

HPIGRAPHIA INDICA. 
(VOL. XII. 
adopted was not purely mechanical. The publication of the Sonpur grant of Satrabhañjadêya! : has thrown new light on the Bhanja dynasty of Orissa. As Bābů Nāgöndra Nath Vasa's odition is not free from mistakes, I have edited both platos together. I obtained threm, in 1911, through Mr. L. E, B, Cohden-Ramsay, I.C.S., Political Agent, Orissa Petdatory States, along with two other plates, one of which has already been edited by me in this Journals while the other one has been published by Babū Någündra Näth Vasa. 
Tho plates were found in the Foadatory state of Baudh in Orisha and " were turned up by the plought". Further details about their discovery are vot available to me. At present the platos bolong to the Feudatory Chief of Baadh. The first verse of both of these plates and many of the following ones correspond to those of thu Sonpur grant of Satru bhanjadova. For tho sake of distinction I bavo named the plates A and B. 
A.-The Bandh Grant of Ranabhafijadēva ; the 54th year. 
The inscription recording this grant is incised on three plates of copper measuring from 81 to 81" in length and from *" to 49" in breadth. Thoy are held together by a ring, *" thick and nearly 4" in diameter, of the same metal, passing through round holes about " from the edges of the platos. The first plata only corries writing on the inner side. The royal seal, soldered to this ring, is round in shape and measures 27" in diameter. The impression of the seul consists of a crescunt above, the name of the king sri-lanabhöñjadēvasya in the middle, and a seated bull, facing the propor loft, below. The plates with ring and saal weigh 232 tolus, 
The charactors of the inscription are more arobaic in form than those of the Bamanghati grant of the same king or the now Sonpur granth of his fathur Satrubbañjadóva. They are moro akin to the characters of the Gamsir grant of Nötribhaju? and the Orissa plates of Vidyadharabhañja The inscription montions a king named Gandhata in l. 5 as tho king's father. In grant B in the same verso Šatrubbañjadēva ia mentioned as the father of the king. Further on, 1, 12, it is mentioned that tbe king was born in the fainily sprong from the egg (vansa-prabhav-ündajal), with which we may compare the similar phrase used in the Son par grant of his fathor (undajis-vaisu-prabhavah). He is styled Paremamahēšvara Maha. raja, 1. 12. Ho is styled Tänaka in l. 17 of grant B of the year 26. He addresses the oficers of tho Khidjali mandala and informs them that the village of Konatinthi in the rishuya has been given to a Bhātaputra, the son of Väsudova, whose name has been omitted through carelessness, who was an emigrant from Apilomulēri and an inhabitant of Anvākara sarā, belonged to the Rohita götra, the Rohita ashtuka, the Viśvāmitra pravara, the Chhāndoga charana and the Kuuthana dakha. The grant was writton in the 54th year of the king in the dark half of Bhādrapada by the Sāndhi-rigrahiya (Sandhi-vigrahika) Himadatta, Was incised by the Arkasali Gonaka and sealed with the Royal seal.

B-Bandh Grant of Rapabbañjadēva; the 26th year. This grant is incised on three copper«plates held together by a oircular ring which pasion through holes bored on the right margin of the plates, about " from the edge. Tho first plate bears writing on the inner side only. The last plate is broken near the ringhole, perhaps in consoquence of an attompt to remove the plato from the ring without cutting the latter. The plates teasure 61" by 45". The last plato, however, is only 4" broad in the middle. The ring is " thick and has a diameter of 2". It passes through the bottom of an oval soal measuring 27" by 2". The soal bears, in high relief, a couchaut bull facing the proper left, and abovo it crescent and bun. Below the bull is tho legond fri-Ranabhanjailāvusya in Nāgam letters. Below the legond again is an expanded lotus flower with stem. The plates with ring and seal weigh 155 tolas. The riog had not boen cut when the impressious wore prepared by Mr. Krishna Sastri. 
The iusoription has been very carelessly incisod, and words and oven parts of versos hayo been omitted in many cases. In the metrical portion it is stated that Satrubhanja was the father of the king Ranabhadjadeva, who was a devout Vaishnava and meditated on the foot

of his father and mother. Elke woe lang of both the Khiajalis which were mentioned in the Soppar plates of Satrabha ja as Ubhaya-Kunjali-mandale and as Khihjalt in plate A. He is styled Rapaka (I. 17), one who will worshipped by the Mahasimantas, who had obtained the five great sounds, and who had obtained a boon from the goddens Stambhidivari. The inscription records tho grant of the villago of Vandhring in the Khatia vishaya to a Bri Vajasandga charana, the Maudgalya gotra, the Bhartyasva pravara, and the Aågirasa anupravara, the Bhattapatra Damodars, surnamod Bhushana, the son of Bhattabhushana, who hailod from the Bhatta-village of Khaduvapali, and, after his death, to his son the Bhattapatra Cbhadoka (?). The grant was made in the 28th year of the king on the oth day of the bright fortnight of Mārgasiras. It was incised by the merchant (varik) and goldsmith (Suvarnnakara) Sivanaga, the son of Papdi, and sealed with the Royal soal. This man Šivaņāga also sealed the Sonpor grant of Rapablaaja's father Satrubhanja. I edit the inscription from the original plate.

BY LIONEL D. BARNETT. 
(Conoluded from p. 298.) 0._OF TEE TIME OF VIKRAMADITYA VI: A.D. 1108. This inscription is on a stone in the garden-land of Chikkira-Rāmappa, on the north of the village. -At the top of the stone there are soulpturos : towards the contre, the sun and moon, and bolow them, from left to right, two standing figaros, a cow and call, and a nyoked sword or dagger.---The writing covers a spaco abont l'!" wide by 3' 11" high, and is for the most part very well preserved: but thoro has been slight damago at tho onds of lines 23 to 
The oharacters are Kanareso, of the regular type of the eloventh and twellth centuries : their shape in intormediate botwoon the gowowhat slenilor sloping character of the previous generation and the upright roundod forns that appear soon afterwitrils. Their height varios slightly, buing approximately it" to ". They aro fairly well forined; but in homo ca xos (riz. lines 32 and 43) letters have been omitte'l and afterwarıls addol bulow tho lino.-Except for one Sanskrit verse at the beginning and two at the ond, thi languago is Kingreso, in prost, and practically in the medieval form of devo'opmont: noto the nominative plural in art (instonl of ar) in lines 16, 17, 18, 24, 32, and the loontivo in alli, lines 28-29, 33, agrimet a freol aso of the ondinga ol and al. Wo may poto tho word kamms (line 30), doustinz a m uro of arou; uoither kamma nor kamba, which appears in some other inscriptions, is known to Kittel's dictionary. 
The object of the insoription is to rooord the grant of cortain Innily in the noighboarhood of Yowür, hou bes, an oil-mill, and a 0ustoms duty to be loviud in kind on the sale of aroca-nuts, for the apkeep of a local temple of Kesava (Vishạn); and it was issued by Satyaprachára Bhattaraka Dova, apparently a pontiff of a (? Vaishnava) sanctuary at Yowiir, in the roiga of the Western Chalukya king Tribhuvanainalla- Vikramniditya VI. The Gunoral Raviyana-bhatta and tho god Isrpośvart, mentioned in this rocord, are already known from tho Yewör inscription B, of A.D. 1077 (p. 269 above). 
The details of the date of this inscription are: tho opolio yotr Pirthiva, being the thirtieth year of the Chalakja-Vikrarna-kila, ... of the roign of Vikramiditya VI; tho new-moon of Märgasira; Somavira (Monday). Dr. Fleet gives mo the following romarks :-"Like so mnany dater of the eloyonth and twelfth centuries, this date is irregular; that is, it does not work out ia satisfactory agreement with the sinted details, the discrepancy here being in rospoot of the wock-day. The Pārthita sa invatsura in question bogan, as a Chaitrādi lavar year according to the southern lunisolar system of the cyclo, on 18 Miurch, A.D. 1105. Tho givon tithi, the new-moon of Mārgastraha, Answers for that year to 8 Docombor, on whioh day it ondod at about 9 hrs. 47 min, after moan Bunrise (for Ujjain). But that day was a Fridny, whorcas tho 
Gora Moudoy." record specifies a Monday." 
The only places mentioned are Ehür, i.e. YowOr itself, and the Sagara three-hundred, in whioh distriot the record locates Ehir. For some romarks on this district sou above, p. 272 f.

[VOL. XII. 
D.-OF THE TIME OF VIKRAMADITYA VI: A.D. 1110. 
This inscription is on a stone apparently built into a wall near a mosque inside the village. There seems to have been a full row of soulpturos at the top of the stone ; but there is seen Not only a cow, at the loft end. The writing covers a space about_147" in width by 19" in height. It is well enough preseryod as far as it goes; but the bottom of it, containing the miuatory formulæ, is broken away and lost.. 
The characters are Kovarcse, of the early twelfth century; they vary in sizo from about ho to ".- Ths language is Oid-Kavarese prose. 
The inscription records donations to a temple of Kapimataiyara at Bhor by certain guilds of craftsmen, and is datud iu the reign of the Western Chalukya king Tribhuvanamalie 
Vikramiditya VÌ.. 
The details of the date of this inscription are : the cyclic year Vikrita, being the thirty fifth yonr of the Chalnkya-Vikrama-varsha, i.c. of the reign of Viklamiditya VI; the full-moon of the bright fortnight of Joshta, (1.0. Jyēshtha, J yaishtha); Somavāra (Monday); an eclipse of the moon. Dr. Flest vivos me the following romarks :-"Tho tithe is denoted by tho curious word paurạnamn-i vñsye, which looks like a mixture of paurņa mási And, amdvdsye ; but the specifiontion of the fortnight and the eclipse make it cloar that the fall-moon was intended. This duto, aldo, is irregular. The Vikrita sanvatsara in question began on 23 March, A.D. 1110. The givon tithi, the fnll-moon of Jyaishtha, answers for that year to 4 June, on which day it endot at about 5 hrs. 49 min. after mean sunrise (for Ujjain). But the day was a Satury, wherete the rocord specifies a Monday; and there was no oolipse, either visible or invisible in India. It may bo added that thore was also no eclipse of the 80n, cither visiblo or invisible iu India, at the new-moon of Jyaishtha, which was at about 4 hrs. 7 min. on Sunday, 19 June."

E.OF THE TIME OF VIKRAMADITYA VI : A.D. 1125. 
This inscription is on a pillar in the south part of a tompie of Bhimvi-Basavanna, " Baunya nun of the woll". Thero aro no sculptures in this caso. -Tlio writing covers a spaco about 9" in width by 2 l" in height, and is well-preserved. 
The obaracters are Kanarese, and good types of the writing of tho oarly twolfth contary ; their warerago height is from about " to ".--The language is Kanarese proso (lines 1-21), followed by a Sanskrit mipatory formula in verso (lincs 21-3-6). The Kanaroso is in a slage of development midway betwoon the uricient and the medieval dinlects ; typical of this is the ubo of the euphonio powol i in brahmanarigan (liues 8, 10) and brälınanariye (line 1.b), besido devarggar (line 8) and similar forms. Thore is some confusion between the intorvocalio 1 and the Kanareno l; thas we find Châlukya (line 1), kolagunan (line 15), and phalan (line 16 beside phalam (lino 24), oto. On the other hand we lind afirluraryge (line 17) for alidavargge. 
The object of the insoription is to record a grant of land for tho maintenanco of tho lights and staff of the templo of Somośvara nt Ebür by a minister zamod Lakshmanayya, who bears the title of tačega dandanayaka (lines 5.6). If we may connect this torni with the coinmon word tado, bar, rostraint', we may conjecturally translate the titlo as " gonoral in charge of reserves ", in the fiscal, not the military, sense. 
Tho details of the date of this inscription are : tho cyclic yoar Viśyāvagn, being the fiftictha year of the Chālaky-Vikrama-küla, i.e. of the reign of Vikraiuiditya VI ; the fifth day of the bright fortnight of Bhõdrapada ; Bţibesparivala (Thursday). Dr. Floot givos nuo the

F..OF THE TIME OF HAYAMURARI-SQVIDEVA : A.D. 1178. 
This inscription is on a pillar in the east part of the samo tomple of Bhādvi-Basavana, In this case, again, there are no soulptures. The writing covers a space about 124* in 'width by 9" in boight, and is well-preserved. 
The obaraoters arg Kanarege, of a type usual in the 
Kanarese, of a type usual in the latter half of the twolfth century, and measure on an average about in height. They are upright and well rounded, and are' morg. over characterised by the occasional use of two special letters, namely thoso for m and y, which Were favoured during this period in Kanarose epigraphy, Tho letter me when thus 'writton strongly resembles the ordinary to, oxcept that the hook on the top of it is usually shorter than A superscript o; tho y is very like tho form which is depioted in Bühler's Palwographia, plato 8, ool. 10, no. 35, except that in our insoription tbo lotter is surmountod on its right side by a small curl resembling that used for the vowel e. We have thouo peculiar forms in nu at the end of l. 1, ma at the end of l. 4, main iu l. 10, and yu in l. 2. The language is throughout Kanareso prose, Tho eophonic , usual in the later language botweon r and g, is found in dåvarasarige (1. 4), as against, e.g., brahmanargge (1. 13); u is writton instead of the virāma in srimatu (1.1), badagalu (1.8), müdala (ib.), and mattaru (l. 9). Onou wo find for / (1. 10); and takes the place of the older. 
The object of the inscription is to record & grant of land mado in tho reign of the Kolachurya king Biyamurári-döviděxa for the maintenance of the tomple of the god Mallikärjans at Shar. The donor is a certain Tripuräntaka-dēvarasa, describod as maha. prabhu (apparendy & governor) of ühür, who made the grant at the instanco of his son TAlayara Ohandeya-noyaka. The genealogy of this Tripurintaka is fully given in the next ipaription, (G). The conveyance of the land was performod with "laving of the foot of Tatpurusha.dota", who must have been a priest or Achārya of the temple. 
• The details of the date of this inscription aro: the opclio year Vijaya, boing the seventh year of the reign of the Kalaohurya king Råyamurāri-Sövidova; the full-moon day of Kārttika ; Adivara (Sunday). Dr. Fleet gives me tho following remarks:-" The Vijaya saivatsaru in question began on 16 March, A.D. 1173. The given tithi, the fall-moon of Kārttika, Answers for that year to 22 Ootobør, on which day it onded at about 16 hrs. 35 min. after

Ans, Vol. XI, p. 127, and plate, line 14, parandattamubá. There was a corresponding form of v: it does not ocour la the prenent inscription F, but is found in the next one, G, as well as in B abovo (ovärähad, 1. 2, p. 274, and orrp, d. 143, P. 879).

The lithi began, of course, on the Banday, but at a very late time, namely at about 17 hrs. 43 min., or practically midnight; and no reason can be recognized in this tase for using the tithi as the current oue at each an hour. Accordingly, this date, again, must be classed as irregular."

INSCRIPTIONS FROM YEWUR: G, OF A.D. 1179.

The characters are Kanarose, averaging from in" to a little over in height. They aro well rouoded, upright, and clearly out, and are good typoa of the Kanarose writing of tho latter half of the twelfth century. The special form of y, mentioned on p. 335 above as ap pearing in the inscription F, is found here in kiriyavarit (1. 8) and Mirimjeya (I. 24), and as the upper member of the oonjanot consonant in Kulachuryya (1. 19) and dohiryyarı (1. 20). . The corresponding form of v is found as the upper menuber of the conjunot lettor in puruvad (1. 22), pūrvvahan (1. 28), and pūrova (1. 47, twice). The corrosponding forma of m, wbich is found in the inscription F and dates from A., D. 801, is not found hero. 
The language of the inscription is Kanareso, in verse (11. 3-14) and prosa (11. 14-46), preceded by the well-known Sanskrit verse beginning Namas tuinga" (il, 1 to 3). and conclud. ing with a Sanskrit minatory formula (11. 46-8). The metrical Kanarose portion consists of two vers08, which are borrowod with slight variations from verses 73 and 75 of inscription B : these are in the pare ancient dialect. Tho proso part verges on the medieval dialect, showing the nominative plural with enphonic u in ru, the dative in -rige (l. 44, but -rgge in l. 27), and initial k for p (halladin, 1, 36, and hattri, 11. 38-9).- As regards orthography, wo may note that is used for r in Oranlana (1. 37). The ancient does not appear, being replaced by i in pogalo (Il. 7, 14), nogal (I. 15), kolagelman (1. 12), aud alio (11. 4:1-6). Tho notation of the virama by the vowel u is found in sovornl placos in the prose portion, as well as in dhatriyodu (II. 13-14), aud more notably in tatu-kaniyan (1. 11) and bhavētu (1. 48). 
The purport of the inscription is to rocord a donntion of land made in the time of the Kalachurya king Sankamadēva by Tripurantaka-ddvarasa, tho mahā-problır of Ebür, who is the protagonist of the previous inscription F. Jo hore grants two plots of land and a right of drawing water to Jñanarūši, the abbot of the Sniva monastery attaohod to tho local touplo of Svayathbhu-Somanātha (Siva), for the maintenance of his establishmont. 
Tripurantaka-dáva was the son of the Ctenoral Nachaya-bhatta or Näohana, eldost son of the same Ravidēva who is celebrated in our inscription B above, whore the podigroo of tho two latter worthies is fully set forth. 
* The donee Jñánarisi is liere describod as being of tho spiritual lineage of Chikkadēva of Miriðje (the modern Miraj), the disciplo of Maleyāļa-dēva of tho churoh of Eļomela Siinha; the three last-named also appear ia our inscription B, 11. 220-7, 7 above, p. 283. This fraternity geoms to have been a loonl branch of the ancient Läkulisa-Pasapata or Kālāmukha soct of Saivism, which apparently affected namos compounded with roši. The suct, which is supposed to have had its original homo in Gujarāt, had madout this time considerablo progress in the South. Somo nearly coutomporary inscriptions at Kalattar and Tiruvānuk koyil inention Gomadattu Sailarăsi Pandita and Jõõuar si Paodita (possibly identical with the Jñānardsi of the present inscription) as professors of the Kalamukha doctrine and in possession of the tomples thore (ROO tho Prograse Report of the Epigraphist for Madras, 1311-12, p. 67). In the Kanayo80 country the soot had beon established for many yeary: we find it in 1161 at Managoļi (800 vol. V above, p. 96.), whero tho samo Jñãourādi is montioned (ib., p. 30 f.). 
The dotnils of the date of this inscription are : tho cyclius year Vikärin, being tho fourth year of the reign of the Kalaohurya king Saškaniadāva; the now-moon day of Ăśvaynja; Somivāra (Monday); a mahd-parvan, Dr. Fleet gives me the following romarks :-* The Vikärin samvatsara in question began on 11 Marol, A.D. 1179. The givon lilli, the new, moon of Advina, answers for that year to Tuosday, 2 October, on which day it endod at about 13 hrs. 2:3 min, aftor mean sunrise (for Ujjain). But the occasion is marked as a special one by being mentioned 88 & maha-parvan ; and the allusion apparoutly is to the Dipāvnli, 1 Sao Dr. Fleet's note ou p. 333 above.

The Dipävali or "row of lampa" buing chiefly a nocturnal festival, the grante reglatered by this record may well have heco inade at night on tho Monday, when the now-moon tithi bad begun, which was at abont 16 hrs. 1 min., or roughly 10.0 P.M.; and this may have led to the tithi boing oited with the veekday on which it began. Accordingly we may take Monday, i Qotober, A.D. 1179, 28 & sufficiently satisfactory cquivalent of the given dato." 
Among places this record again mentiona Yowar by its oarlier pame of Dhor. For Bollumbatte, Elar.ve, Mirimje, and Sivapuram, which are all mentioned in the inscription B, Bed above, p. 272. Dr. Fleet tells me that Odagere, which is mentioned in line 29, is

tomaplo, now gone out of oxiatonce and of which there exists at present only a mandapa; in this is placed now & modern figure of Ganesa. Long time ago the copper-plates on which the inscription under consideration is engraved were found in this ruined Vishņu temple, and they have been preservod in the family of Svāminātha Aygar of that place. They were got ou loan from their owner by Mr. Kapposrāmi Sāstri, and from the impression prepared under the supervision of Mr. Gopinātha Rao tho inscription on them is edited below. 
The set cohsists of throe plates of the usual size and shape of the Vijayanagara docil ments. Tho, plates are bound togother by n ring, which was cat whon they came to us for cxamination. Along with the plates, thore is strong in the ring n seal which bears on it the represontation of a boar facing the proper right, the sun and thu moou, a daggor, and two clubs placed V-wise. The preservation of the record is tolerably good. Tho alphabet is Nandināgari and the language Sanskrit. At the end of tho inscription is the sign-manual of the Vijaya nagara emperors, tho namo Sri Virūpüksha, in the Telugu alphabet. The first and tho socoad plates are marked with tho Telugn-Kannada numorals, 1 and 2; in the first plato it is in the loft margin of the rororde, and in the socon, in the saune margin of the obverse, but much nonrer the ring-hole. The third plate bears no numbor at all. 
This record, instend of employing the usual singlo and doublo vertical strokes at the end of half and full verscs, usos horizontal strokes (or hyphens). The secondary b-oymbol resembles in form tho necondary e-form of the Tamil alphabet; that is, the freo end of tho curve dous not. roach the bottom; e.y. in dhuitrē, 1. 3; in kshira., 1. 5; in -Sripati-, 1, 10, etc. Instead of ri we often find regi; thus nrsipatis= for ripuliss, 1. 8. The consonant aih has a slightly different form from the same letter orourring in other Vijayanagara documonts of the same porio ; compare -Ganädnic, 1. 1; dadhan, 1. 4; Bredha., l. 7, etc. The dot representing tho anusrara is placed by the elde of and not, in the usual way, on thic top of the consonant to whioh it belongs ; compare wininga., .churbi-, and -chaira, l. l; -úrumbhao, l. 2; lurishļri-sard (19“, 1. 3 ; -bhūta ir purchasya., l. 5, eto. The lotters y and p are almost similar to each other; the only differenco observablo is that the latter has a larger loop than the former; compare the p und y occurring in -patayê, l. 1; p in -räpi and y in jayati, 1. 5, etc. The compound ss looks liko ś8, that is, the cross line in the first s is omitted ; cf. -dandas 81, l. 3; -gsutah, l. 16; -kais sar, 1. 24; mahaujās-sdmrajye, 1. 36 ; chatussimi-, l. 76; -jas=sürya-, 1. 93 ; bhūsurds sarre, , 103; stayambhūBesarasum, and -patēs=8ünuh, l. 100. 
As far as it is known to us at present, this is the first copper-plate documont of the Nayaka kings of Tanjore hitherto published. The inscription records that, at the rcquost of Sevyappa Nāyaka, the first prince of this dynasty, the Vijayanagara emperor, Srirangadê. varaya, granted the village of Arumolimangalam to the Mädhva gurri, Vijayındra Tirtha. The dato of the graut was a Monday, the first dvădasil in the brigbt half of the month of Ashadha, in the year Dh&tfi, which corresponded with the Saka year 1400 (exprossed by indu (tho moon), payodhi (the oceans), graha (tho planota) and raina (the gems). The grant was made in the presence of the god Ramachandra of Penugoņda.The grant had already been

, Tirumala transferred the seat of government to Penngonda (Ep. Ind., Vol. III, p. 238 ff.). His second son, Rorya II., the same who figures in our record, is actually called the king of Penugopde. The present inscription has (1. 81) Peruikä dapura, that is, the wecondary -ymbol of ko and the anusrärt after the wame letter arc wanting to make it read Peruðkondapura, which enight le takon to be a inintake for Penugandapura. It is of coorae ponsible that we havo to do, not with a temple iu Peuugonda, but with a temple of Rainnchandra in an unknowu place that might have been known by the name Perungadu or Peronkadajura. But at proscut wo know of no such place, sud hence we choose to take l'erunyadapura as a mistake fur Perugundapura, the un pital of Rangæ II., where the king had every facility for making the graut.

The vijñapti of the grant, Sevvappa Nayaka, is, is we havo alrendy haid, the first king of the Nayaka dynasty of Tanjore. Mr. Kupposvāni Sastri has shown in his excellent little book on the history of the Nayakas of Tanjore that Sevyappa was tho husband of the sistor of the quoen of Achyutadóvariya of tho Tuluva dynasty of Vijayanagarn, nod that the lattor granted the Tanjore country is stridhana to lie sister-in-law.

Sanskrit into Tamil in the year S. 1527.1 The Dutoh, who tried to land at Negapatam in order to found a trading factory, wero ropulsed and driven away by Achyutapp& NĀyaka. Like bis father, he also made his son, Raghunatha Nayaka, yuvarāju in his own lifotime. The name of tho quocu of Achyutappa Nayaka in Mürttimámba. 
The donne, Vijayindra Tirtha, is one of tho most famous of the Mādhva ách is known of his parentago and his birth place. Surëndra Tirtha of the Porvādi or Sumatindrs madha, who was the twelfth in doscont from Madhvachārya, the founder of the Dvaita school of philosophy, was the spiritual guru of Vijayindra. It is from him that ho roceived the roles of saunyāst, and eventually he also snccooded him on the pontifio&l see as the thirteenth grirti. But Vijayindra, like Vūdirīju Tirtha of the Saude matha; received all his education in philosophy from the great Vysarāya Tirtha of the Vytsarāya matha. Vijayimira was hucceeded by Sudhindra and he, in his turn, by Rāghavondra Tirtha, who was the fifteenth in the list of succession. Next to Srimad Apanda Tirtha (another name of Madbvācbārya) and Jaya Tirtha, the most important names in tho history of tho Madhya biorarchy are Vyžaarāya Tirtha, Vijayindrn Tirtha, Vüdiraja Tirtha and Raghavondra Tirtha. Therefore, a short summary of the lives of these four ācharyas will not be out of place in this paper. 
Brahmanya Tirthia of the Vyasarāsa matha was onco doing his pūja when a lady came and prostrated herself before him. In the usual way he blogsed her to be a sumangali for a long time and become the mother of noble sons. But the woman told him that her husband was breathing his last, and thnt his blogxing was going to be of no avail to her. However, Brahmanya Tirtha assured her that her husbaud would live long and that she would renlly bavo noblo yons, and he asked her to promiso lijn her first born non, which she gladly did. After some time a Bou was born to her, and she promptly mado the child over to Brahmaụya Tirtha. That Svāmin brought the child up on the milk that was used for abhisheku in his pūja. When the child grew to about the seventh year of ago, tie upanuyana roremony was performed and a littlo time after he was made a sangyäsin. This pupil of Brahmanya Tirtha was Vyāsa (i.e. Vyasarıya) Tirtha." His higher education was undertakon liy Sripādarāya Tirtha of the Mulbāgal madwx.? He became a great scholar and favqurite with royal personages. It is anid

that when once the conjunction of the planots foreboded evil to tho raling king of Vijayanagara, he vacated the throne for one muhúrta in favour of Vyasarāya Tirtha, fully believing that his spirituality could provent the evil from tuking place; hence it is that the distinct. titlu raya of the Vijayanagara dynasty was assumed by this Mäduva teacher. No mention is however made in inscriptions of tho ocoa pution of the throno of the Vijayanagara empiro by any sonnyäsin, but there exists the tradition among the Madhvus about the Svåmia's occupy. ing the throne, and a custom in the matha perpetuutos the event ; every night, uter all the sorvices in the malha aro over, tho Svñmin sits on his sout, with a costly shawl tied round liis bead, and the offioers of the malha presont thounsolves ono after mother boloru the Svāmin, bow before him and retire. Tbis ceremony is callod diruti-sulim, and it is supposed to be indicative of royalty.

A number of grants inade by this suyoreign to Vyasarāya Tirtha seem to corroboruto our surnuise. Agrin, when Vallabhāohārya, the founder of the pushti or bhakti mrga, dosired to preach his tonots before tho king in tho presence of his pandits, the king choso Vyāsurāya Tirtha as the president for the occasion." Vyāsarāya was tho author of soveral works of which the inost important are the Chunlrika the Nyāyāmrita, tho Bhēlājjivann, otc. The second of these works olicited a powerful criticisuu from Madhusudana Sarasvati, who thon wrote his well-known toitu-sibuhi.

is said to have been the master of the sixty-foar haldt or branches of learðing, which he employed in vanquishing & great Vira-Saiva guru who had a large following and who had his mathe at Kumbhakopan. The condition under which this philosophion wrangle took place was that, if the Vira-Saive guru sucoooded, the Mädbva dobarga should jain him with all his followers; and if tho Madhya ãohārya succeeded, the Vira-Saiva guru should make over his matha with its bolongings to the Mädhya dobārya and go away to tho nortb, never aftor to return to Kumbhakopam. After an oleven days' discussion, Vijayındra oame ont successful. The Vira-Saiva guru was obliged to leave the placo and retire to the north, making over bis matha and all its belongings to his vanquisher, whose spiritual descendants still enjoy its possossion. On the anniversary of thin ovont the image of Vijayindra is takon in prooession to this matha oven at tho present day. Whon Appaya Dikshita wrote condemping the Madhya philosophy, Vijayındra Tirtha wrote several refutations of his works. He also wrote commentaries on almost all important Madhva works. The most important of his works are Ohakra-Mimansa, Chandrikodahrta-Nyaya Vivarana, Nyayamrita-Vyakhyd, Appayya kapola-chepatikā, etc. 
Vadiraja Tirtha, the 00-student of Vijayindra ander Vyasardya Tirtha, belonged to the Saudo motha and was the fourteonth in descent from Madhvacharya. His immediato predecessor was Vagisa Tirtha.* Vidirāja was a great controversialist, writer and commentator. Liko his co-disciple, Vijayindra Tirtha, he wrote a large number of works and commented on many of tho troatises of his predecessors. Ho had travelled far and wide and at the end of his pilgrimagos he incorporated his experiences of the several places which he visited, in bis Tirtha-pabandha. At Saudo he built a temple for Krishna and a mathas with the help of the Rāją of Sauda, who became his admirer and disciple. Several superhuman acts are attributed to him and it is stated that he achieved them with the help of the god Hayagrive, whoso favourite he happened to be. Ho was & Tuļuva Brahmana by birth. 
At the same poriod as Vijayindra and Vâdirāja thors lived the Srivaishgaya acharyas Doddayyācharya of Cholasingapurana and Tātācharya of Conjeevaram. The formor wroto in refutation of Appayya Dikshita's Advoita-Dipika his famous Chandamarutam; he is, on this acconnt, known by the namo of Chandandrutam Doddayyacharya.? The latter was the

Raghavenáta Tirtha was, like bis guru Sudbiodra and his illustrious predecessor Vijayın dra, a Kannada Brāhman. He was ordained a sannyasin rather late in life. Before this event he went by the namo of Vopiveukata-bhatta. According to the macha list, he came to the pontificate in 8. 1545, Rudhirðdgāri, and continued till the Srāvana vadya 2nd of $. 1993, Virodhikrit, thus reigning for a period of 47 years and 5 months. Tradition assorts that he was a black, well built man and that his oxternal appearance often belied his mental greatness. Ho is also accredited with supernatural powers, which are said to be felt to this day at tho place of interment of bis romains. But to the Madhvas bis grcatooss doce not lie so much in bis pbysical powers as in his moutal capabilitios. He was also a prolifio writor and a powerful controversialist.

From the Viļāppākkam and the Kuniyor platest we learn that Rāma-kavi, their author, was the son and grand-son respectively of Kāmakoti and Sabhāpati. The present platos and the British Muscom Plates of Sadāsie radóvarāya& states that Svayambhū was the son of Sabbāpati.

Vijayanngar om porors seems to havo bought and obtained a place similar to that of his father at tho ci urt of the PĀpdyas, who had already become the vassals of Vijayanagara. The rela tionship botweon theso is shown in the accompanying table : 
Sabhāpati. 
Svayambhữ. 
Kāmakbti. 
Rājanatlia. 
Rāma-kavi. 
In the comedy named Somarallı. Yögönanda-prahasana the following account of the author, Arnnngirinātha, is given : Nāgapna-kavi, who bore the several birodas Kari-prabhu, Ashta-thrisha-hari, Kavi-naga-kosurin, etc., who was of the Sāna-Veda and who was a followor of the Srikanthāgama, had a son named Rājanatha-Desika. He was married to Abhirama Nāyikā, the daughter of Dindima-prabhu and sister of Sabhāpati of the Kalyana götra and the Sāma-Vöda, whose ancestors boro the title Aghorašivacharyas. To these was born Arunngirinātha. He held several distinguisling titles such as Dindima-kari-sīrvabhaums, 2 Oler-Chola-Pandya-prathamäridnya.Dindima-kavi, Dasarüpa - Nārāyana - barudamnandana. Dindima, Rasika-kavitā-sämrdjya-Lakshmipati, Naranä laka-bharatacharya, Kavimalla. qalla-trīdanapalu,? Pratibhutu-kaki-kunjara-pañehānana, etc. Tho Saluvabhyudayam calls the futber of its author, (that is, of Rūjanātha-kavi), Sonādrinātha. The author of the Bhaga. ratuchumpz, Achyuturāyābhyudayam, eto., was also a Răjanātha-kavi, whose father was also Sonādrinātha. From these facts we are forced to draw the conclusion that the RĀjanātha-kavi of Sälarabhyudaya, Achyutarüyübhyudaya and Bhagavalachampū was one and the same porson ; but then it is not possible to explain "why he wrote his Saluvābhyudaya long aftor the hero of that work was dead.
