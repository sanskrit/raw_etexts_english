I am pretty annoyed right now at the ongoing attempts at misusing
Goddess Kali as part of attempted metapolitical \[and often outright
metaphysical political\] ‚Äòanalysis‚Äô.



Now to be sure, I am NOT against folk attempting to incorporate
religious understandings of the world into their politics. I do it all
the time. I encourage others to do the same. But if you are GOING to do
this, then the onus is on YOU to i) do it right; ii) not blithely palm
off the responsibility for accuracy onto whichever authors you‚Äôre
referencing with your work.



FIRST point to be made here is that the main figures being drawn upon to
substantiate a lot of the material being bandied around at the moment
are guys like Evola and Guenon. Now I‚Äôm NOT going to say that nobody‚Äôs
allowed to read and reference non-Indian thinkers and writers talking
about Hindu-inflected subject-matter ‚Ä¶ because that would be
self-evidently ridiculous. Everybody acknowledges David Frawley et co
generally know their stuff ‚Äì and in this day and age \[stealth pun
there\], there‚Äôs not exactly a shortage of Indian folk who get things
wrong or misuse ancient materials for contemporary political mischief,
either. \[And besides ‚Ä¶ if I were to advocate such a thing, what would
then be the point of your reading anything I might have to say :p \]



But we‚Äôve known for some time now that a number of European authors who
made use of concepts they \*thought\* were authentically Indian in their
work \[interestingly enough, including even Nietzsche\] ‚Ä¶ were in fact
getting the wrong end of the stick. Whether because they relied upon bad
translations, Colonial misunderstandings, seriously secondary or even
tertiary sources, or any of the rest of it. Or, perhaps, because some of
them just didn‚Äôt care that much about accuracy when making an
illustration of some polemical point.



So if you‚Äôre GOING to write a thing which takes from these late-19th,
early-mid 20th century European sources ‚Ä¶ take a step back from the
computer, go and find an \*actual\* source \[or, quite probably, because
these things seem to do better interpersonally, go out and find yourself
a proper Hindu who‚Äôs up for educating you about a few things ‚Äì heh, an
Acharya, indeed\], and reconsider EVERYTHING you‚Äôre about to write in
light of what you‚Äôve just learned.



Because it‚Äôs very possible there‚Äôs a better Hindu principle, metaphor,
or Understanding of the Divine for you to draw upon ‚Äì which may even
helpto change, broaden, and add depth to what you think.



Clear? Good üòÄ



Now, onto the most common fallacy going around at the moment. People
keep making this same mistake that ‚ÄúKali Yuga‚Äù is Yuga within which
Goddess Kali presides. This is ‚Ä¶ largely a result of simple laziness on
the part of Gora who haven‚Äôt bothered to go back to Sanskrit and note
that the English/romanization of Sanskrit sounds is NOT a perfect
reflection. So Even though ‚ÄúKali‚Äù and ‚ÄúKali‚Äù \[‡§ï‡§≤‡§ø and ‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä,
respectively\] LOOK exactly the same in standard romanization ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre
different words \[as you can see by looking at the Devanagari text
above. First one‚Äôs the demon, second one‚Äôs the Goddess. More on that in
a moment.\].



What this leads to, is wrong-headed thinking about role of Goddess Kali
in Kali Yuga ‚Äì with people making grandiloquent ‚Ä¶ yet religiously FALSE
‚Ä¶ prescriptions that this somehow means the trouble of this age is
‚Äòfeminine‚Äô or something.



I can understand why people might think this \[and there‚Äôs a Guenon
quote I‚Äôve recently seen cited which basically states exactly this\],
but it‚Äôs WRONG. If we look at descriptions of Kali Yuga, it is the
\*materialism\* and \*moral degeneracy\* which accompanies it of the age
‚Äì the IMPIETY ‚Äì that is at root of Evilness of Kali Yuga. These are
associated with the MALE demon Kali.



Role of FEMALE Goddess Kali is basically to PURGE this evil as part of
the Pralaya which accompanies the end of this Age. \[there‚Äôs a few
interpretations I‚Äôm combining here, but the broad similarity is that our
Destroyer Goddess ‚Äì whether we are talking of Kali, or Dhumavati, or
other Forms of Mother Goddess ‚Äì IS DEFINITELY NOT responsible for the
malefic influence of the present Yuga ‚Ä¶ but instead, plays lead role in
FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THIS CORRUPTION. \[this is pretty common theme in
Durga myths, as it happens; with Goddess taking Warrior Form to wage war
against whichever Demon is attempting to undermine Righteousness\] See
how this is BACKWARDS from implication many non-Hindu people are
drawing?\]



Now having established that, even though it is Demon Kali rather than
Goddess Kali who is providing the pernicious ‚Äòspirit of the age‚Äô that
must be fought back valiantly against, this does not necessarily mean
that it is inaccurate to state there is a close connection between Kali
Yuga and Goddess Kali.



Instead, as pointed out above, Goddess Kali has VERY IMPORTANT role to
play in this Yuga. Even if that role is, in some tellings, burning the
irrevocably corrupted world to ash for purposes of new Creation coming
into being afterwards as the Great Cycle continues once more.



Thus, I draw something of a distinction between the sort of folks I‚Äôm
calling out here with this post, attempting to make ill-informed
polemical points with things they already believe supported by a thin
veneer of woefully and egregiously
misunderstood/misapplied/outright-Culturally-Appropriated Hinduism ‚Ä¶ and
other thinkers, writers, musicians who‚Äôve gone down a somewhat different
path and made a \*better informed\* and \*more religiously accurate\*
connection between Kali Ma and Kali Yuga with proper respect and
appreciation of the role of the former in the latter. \[i.e. as
Salvatory Agent rather than Rank Antagonist\]



Oh, and DON‚ÄôT get me started on Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom!
Very good reason it was once alleged that Spielberg‚Äôs film was some sort
of plot by Pakistani Intelligence against India üòõ



Anyway. If you are in doubt, the take-home points from this article are:



1. If you‚Äôre using a modern source on Devi Kali, it is quite possibly
seriously suspect. Particularly if it‚Äôs the aforementioned Evola/Guenon
ones. Therefore, CHECK with somebody who is actually OF the religion you
are borrowing from that what you‚Äôre doing is not inadvertently \[or
grossly negligently\] sacrilegious and in egregious error. \[or, as we‚Äôd
term it ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúABSOLUTELY ANARYA‚Äù\].



2. Integrating religious understandings into
political/metapolitical/metaphysical analysis can be a REALLY GOOD
THING, provided it‚Äôs done RIGHT rather than CARELESSLY or WRONGFULLY
with regard to actual nature and content of aforementioned religious
understandings. Because just as religious thinking can ILLUMINATE
concepts, so that we see hidden depths and previously unconsidered
elements to them, whilst also connecting us with righteous ways of doing
and thinking \[very appropriate and necessary, appropriately enough, in
Kali Yuga due to nature of the age‚Ä¶\] if done in inappropriate or
outright inverted manner, then mistakes and misapplications serve to
OCCLUDE rather than illuminate ‚Äì and can lead to seriously dangerous and
outright corrupting thinking and conclusions. So please make sure you
get it right.



3. Key point to remember is that religious elements are truths in and of
themselves. They are not there simply to provide metaphors for you to
casually decorate your tawdry polemical points with. Your argument, if
you are GOING to bring religious material into it, is there to help
illuminate and bring to an audience the aforementioned religious
understanding. NOT the other way around. Anything else, and it‚Äôs quite
probably cultural appropriation and much more open towards spurious,
specious misuse of wahtever it is you‚Äôre drawing upon. I.e. putting
forward your OPINION in the garb of truth, rather htan Truth in the
guise of your opinion. You wind up, as a chap from Indiana Jones and the
Last Crusade noted, falling into trap of seeking to elevate your own
glory rather than the Divine. And the peril with this, apart from the
disrespect shown to both the culture and the Divinities or other
supernal personages in question, is that you wind up havin difficulty
seeing too much further than your own nose ‚Äì rather than being able to
draw upon the much vaster vision of seers, sages, and Suras.



4. So with that in mind ‚Ä¶ if you FEEL like you‚Äôre going to incorporate a
religious value, term, or perspective into your writing, and
particularly if you‚Äôre not ACTUALLY religious/from the religion in
question ‚Äì can I once again reiterate that you‚Äôll probably find your
writing and your output that much the richer if you aactually ‚Äògo back
to basics‚Äô, ASK somebody who knows that of which they speak \[at least
somewhat ‚Äì we are all learning, after all\], and reformulate what you
were initially seeking to put forward with your new understanding in
mind.



5. It‚Äôs quite possible you‚Äôll produce something inestimably better, as a
result üòÄ \[and you won‚Äôt look foolish when somebody calls you on your
completely backwards understanding of a concept that is to us pretty
common knowledge‚Ä¶\]
