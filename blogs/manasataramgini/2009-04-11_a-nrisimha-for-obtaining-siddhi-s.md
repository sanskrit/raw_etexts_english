R1’s father had been lead by a descendant of the famous medieval
tAntrika lakShmIdhara to an extremely remote shrine of nR^isiMha amongst
ruins in the kali\~Nga country. This shrine is in a place known today as
Sonepur and is not far away from a temple of the most exalted
yoginI-jAla-shambara. R1’s father and the descendant of the said
tantrika stated that they attained siddhi of several mantra-s from the
pA\~ncharAtra tantra-s when they performed brief japa before this
lakShmI-nR^isiMha. I finally found a picture, albeit pretty hazy, of the
same image.
