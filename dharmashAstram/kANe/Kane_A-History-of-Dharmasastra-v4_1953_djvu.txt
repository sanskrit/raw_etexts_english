PREFACE 

Tho third volume of tho History of Dharmnslstra vn« 
published in October 194G. In the hriof iwofnrf to that volume 
I intimated that the romaininR topic? of Dhnrnw 3s(ra would 
he dealt with in one volume. But as 1 proceeded with tho task 3 
found that that was a mi«>cnlcnlaUon. To present in one 
volume all tho topics that remained in the manner and on 
the scale that I had adopted in tho fir«l three volume*; w*n« 
found to he impossible. Besides, as my ace advanced, 1 could 
not maintain the same speed and finHi tho whole history in a 
few years as 1 intimated 1 would do in tho preface to tho thud 
volume. Therefore, 1 had to decide, however reluctantly, to 
spread tho remaining work over two volume". Owing tn tho 
scarcity of paper and paucity of skilled worker*, thi* volume 
has been in the press for more than three years This volume 
deals with eight topics, viz Patako, Prfiyascittn. Knrmavipal'a, 
Antyesti, Asauca, Suddhi, SrSddha and Tlrtlmyfitrfi, These 
subjects are of great interest to anthropologists*. There was 
great temptation for me. when dealing v.ith these topics, to 
indulge in dwelling upon similar beliefs, usages and ritca des- 
cribed in such works as Frazor's 'Golden Bough.' Vot two 
reasons, however, I have rarely succumbed to this temptation. 
In the first place, thoro was the fear of increasing tho hulk of 
tho work which has already assumed onormous proportion"?. 
In the second place, dwelling on comparisons of ancient 
and medieval Indian usages and rites with similar usages and 
ntes found elsewhere is liable to serious misunderstanding 
Frazers volumes are largely made up of materials concerning 
the beliefs, usages and rites of very primitive people. It 
appeared to me that readers of such comparisons might h c led 
to think that people in ancient and medieval India were at a 
primitive stage of culture, while as a matter of fact tbey had a

ii History of Dhai maiastra 

of the eighteenth, century, while Manu (IX. 290) more than 
two thousand years ago prescribed the mild punishment of a 
fine of two hundred panas for all incantations intended to destroy 
hfo, for magic rites and for raising ghosts and goblins. My 
main aim has throughout been to discover, collect, classify and 
interpret the facts of the various departments of Dharmasastra 
and my endeavour has been, as far as in me lies, to present the 
truth with detachment and intellectual integrity and without 
bias ( except what might have been unconsciously engendered 
in my mind owing to my being born and brought up in a 
brahmana family ) to show tho continuity, the developments 
and transformations in Indian beliefs, rites and usages 
throughout the ages and, while bringing the past in its 
causal relations with the present, to indicate and suggest 
future trends and changes in these matters, t 

The fifth and last volumo will mainly deal with tho 
following subjocts vratas and utsavas, sanbiriteB, kala and 
muhurta; pauiana-dharma, tho influence of the Purvamlmamsa 
and .other sastras on dharmasastra; tho cosmological, religious 
and philosophical background of dharmasastra; the fundamental 
aspects of our culture through the ages ; the impact of modern 
social and other ideas and trends on the dogmas and ideals of 
dharmasastra and the future of the latter This by itself is rather 
an ambitious programme. How that I am over seventy-three 
years of age and suffering from several ailments I have mis- 
givings whether I woald be able to write this last volume and 
publish it while all mental and physical faculties are sound I 
am myself extremely anxious to write this last volume as early 
as possible and bring to a conclusion an undertaking to which I 
have devoted all my leisure for over thirty years regardless of 
monetary losses and bodily ailments. With that object in 
view I have given up either entirely or very largely most of 
my other activities and engagements and have thereby offended 
many of my friends. 

This volume also is full of quotations, references to 
inscriptions and judicial decisions. The reasons for this have 

■J- Prof. J. B Bury, a distinguished Professor of History in the 
Cambridge University, thought that freedom from bias was not possible 
and was not also desirable, since a man writing history completely free 
from bias would produce a colourless and dull work Vide 'Selected 
Essays' (edited by Harold Temperley, 1930) p. 70 



Preface *" 

been stated at length in the preface to the second volume and 
therefore they need not be repeated here. The list of additions 
to this volume is much larger than in the preceding volumes. 
I may be pardoned for frankly stating the reason. The first 
and seoond volumes of the History of Dharmasastra were 
published so far back as 1930 and 1941 respectively. No second 
edition of these has yet been called. It seems to me quite 
possible that during my life-time no second edition of the 
volumes of the History, or at least of this volume, might appear. 
Therefore, I tried to incorporate by way of additions such in- 
formation as had escaped me while the work was being written 
in order to make it as complete as possible. 

I now discharge the pleasant duty of acknowledging my 
obligations to others Bloomfield 's Vedic Concordance, the Vedic 
Index of Professors Macdonell and Keith, and the volumes of 
the Sacred Books of the East have been very useful in pre- 
paring this volume as in the case of its predecessors. Parama- 
hamsa SwamI KevalSnanda Sarasvatl of Wai has been a tower 
of strength in all matters of doubt and difficulty and has helped 
me by offering prompt guidance in solving some intricate 
problems. I am highly obliged to Mr. S. N, Savadi of the 
Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona, for help in the correction 
of proofs and to Mt. P. M. Purandare, Advocate ( O. S. ), 
Bombay High Court, and Tarkatlrtha Raghunath Shastri Kokje 
of Lonavla for reading the printed sheets as they came and 
making valuable suggestions. 

It is difficult to name all those who in various ways, during 
the progress of this volume for over six years, kindly rendered 
assistance, but I should like to make special mention of Prof. 
K V. Rangaswami Aiyangar, Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar, 
Dr. A. S. Altekar, Dr. S K Belvalkar, Prof. G. H. Bhatt', 
Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya, Mr. N. G-. Chapekar, Dr. R, N. 
Dandekar, Mr. D. B Diskalkar, Dr. G. S Gai, Prof. P. K. Godej 
Tarka-tlrtha Laksmanashastri Joshi, Mr. G. H. Khare Pandit 
Balacharya Khuperkar, Dr. Umesha Mishra, Dr. V. Raghavan 
Prof. L. Renou, Prof. H. D. Velankar. Thanks are due to these 
scholars and many others for help and interest in this volume. 
I am conscious that in spite of so much help and generous 
encouragement from friends there are in this volume several 
mistakes, the sole responsibility for which rests on my shoulders. 
■In a work replete with thousands of quotations and references 



iv History of Dkarmaiastra 

it is quite likely that many slips have escaped my attention. § 
For these and for the eli9ion of a few diacritical marks and 
the displacement of parts of Sanskrit letters in the process of 
printing the indulgence and forgiveness of all readers aie sought. 
I sincerely thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan Press 
Poona, for carrying out the work of printing this volume with 
care in spite of difficulties caused by papsr and labour shortage.

§ I take this opportunity of correcting two mistakes that I regret I 
committed in the third volume of the Htstorj of Dharmas?stra. In note 1886 
onp 96S(ofvol III) I refer to a work of Mr BatuUath Bhattacharya that 
contains a full treatment of Kalwarjya. I suggested in that note that Mr. 
Bhattacharya probably retouched his thesis after 1937 though it was 
written in 1933, in view of the fact that he referred to the Smrtimuktaphala 
(which was published in 1937 by Mr Gharpure) Through oversight I 
forgot that Mr. Bhattacharya had expressly stated that he used the transcript 
ofams of the Smrtimuktaphala specially made for him. Therefore. I was 
wrong in my surmise that he probably retouched h.s thesis and I must say 
that the thesis as published in 1943 is the same as that written in 1933 for 
the logendiachandra Ghose Research Puzo The second mistake refers to 
Dr UN Ghosalonp 32 (of *oI III) I stated ' it is not possible to hold 
as Tayaswal TJ Ghosal and others do that the theory of social contract was 
the earlier one and the theory of divine right of kings was later on propound- 
ed by the Manusmrti to support the brsbmana empire of Pusyam.tra' In 
■MiUng this sentence my memory was at fault I find that Dr. Ghosal does 
not hold the Mew that I attributed to him. In the 'Indian Historical 
Quarterh' (vol 23, pp 68-70) Dr Ghosal justly protests against my 
bracketing h.m with Jayaswal, but I cannot help observing that the last 
sentence in the paper shows unexpected acerbity In bis whole career as a 
writer Dr Ghosal was not probably guillj of a single slip and could not 
therefore bring himself to bel.cve that m> mistake might have been bona fide.

CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE 

OF 

some important Sanskrit works and authors referred 
to in volume IV 

N.B.— Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are conjectural 
and disputed by several scholars. Most of the dates about authors 
from the 8th or 9th century refer to the probable periods of their 
literary activity except in the case of a few authors such as 
^ankaracarya and Vidyapati. 

4000 B. C.-1000 B. C— The period of the Vedic Samhitas, 
Brahmanas and Upamsads. Some hymns of the Rgveda, of the 
Atharvaveda, and m the Tavttiriya Samhita and Brahmana may 
possibly go back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some of 
the Upamsads ( even from among those that are regarded by 
most scholars as the earliest ones ) may be later than 1000 B. C. 
Some scholars have criticized me for ascribing the vedic 
samhitas to such an early date as 4000 B. C. Time and health 
permitting, I may have to deal with this question in a separate 
work after I finish the 5th and last volume on which I am now 
engaged. 
800 B. C.-500 B. C .— The Nirukta of YasUa 

800 B C.-400 B. C. — The principal srautasutras ( of Apastamba, 
Asvalayana, Baudhayana, Katyayana, Satyasadha and others )

Asvalayana ) 

600-300 B. C. — The Dharmasiitras of Gautama, Apastamba, 

Baudhayana, Vasistha and the Grhyasutras of Faraskara and a 

few others.

SECTION I 

PATAKA, PRAYASCITTA AND EARMAVIPSKA 

(.Sins, expiations and the residual consequences of sins), 

CHAPTER I 

The Article on sin in Hasting's Encyclopaedia of Religion 
and Ethics (vol 11) will clearly show how the idea of sin 
varies from religion to religion, from age to age and from coun- 
try to country. We are concerned here with the growth and 
development of the doctrine of sin m India from Vedic times to 
the medieval digests and commentaries on Dharmasastra 

Sm (putaka) is a word that belongs to the terminology of 
religion rather than to that of Ethics l It is very difficult to 
define sin. In a general way it may be said that it is an act 
which is regarded as a wilful rebellion against or disobedience 
of some law supposed to be laid down by God or Revelation ; it 
is opposition to the will of God manifested in an authoritative 
work or at leant failure to abide by the regulations contained 
therein. 



1 Id these days many people, both in tbe East and the West, ques- 
tion the very existence of sin As Barbour puts it tn his 'Sin and the new 
Psychology • (p 19 ) "The £eetmg is gaining wide acceptance that there is 
no such thing as sm id the Christian sense. Evil may encompass a man's 
life and bring disaster to his personality, but it is not sin It is psychic 
evil that can be explained by psychic causes and perhaps cured by psycho- 
logical therapy .. Many say 'nothing is right and nothing is wrong Every 
thing is the result of complexes ' It has resulted in an easy tolerance of 
sin" Sir Oliver Lodge in his article on 'Christian Doctrine' in the 
Hibbert Journal for 1903-4 at p 466 says 'The htghei man of to-day is not 
worrying about bis sins at all, still less about their punishments His 
mission, if he is good for anything, is to be up and doing and in so far as 
he acts wrongly or unwisely he expects to suffer ' The followers of Car- 
vika who was the prince of Atheists in ancient India used to say 'man should 
live among pleasures as long as life lasts , he 3hould feed himself sumptu- 
ously (lit. should drink gJiee) even by borrowing money from others There 
Is no coming again into the world after the body is reduced to ashes by 
cremation '. 



3 Htiton/ of Dharmasash a [Vol 

The Rgveda is full of fervent and hearts-felt expressions of 
the sense of sin and betrays intense desire on the part of the 
sages of old to be free from it The idea of sin in the Bgveda is 
bound up with the conception of rta. The conception of rfca 
cannot be discussed here in detail But a brief statement is 
absolutely necessary in order to be able to convey what the 
Vedic doctrine of sin was 2 

l$ta had a threefold aspect It means 'the course of nature' 
or 'the regular and general order in the cosmos'; with reference 
to sacrifLoe it means ' the correct and ordered way of the cult of 
the Gods', and thirdly, it also means the 'moral conduct of 
man'. A few passages to illustrate these three aspects of rta 
may be cited here Jig. IV 23 8-10 are 3 three verses m which 
the word rta occurs no less than twelve times and which breathe 
the all-pervading influence of rta thioughout the universe 
'Plentiful waters (or riches or gifts) belong to rta, the thought 
(or laudation) of rta destroys crooked acts (sins), the brilliant 
and rousing hymn of praise to rta pierces the benumbed ears of 
man The props of rta are firm, its (physical) manifestations 
are many and lovely for the sake of the body (i e man) 
Through rta they (people) desire food The cows (sun's rays) 
entered rta by rta He who wins over rta acquires it 3?or the 
sake of rta (heaven) and earth are wide and deep, the two high- 
est cows (i e Heaven and Earth) yield milk (desires or rewards) 
tor the sake of rta ' Some other passages are. 'The Sindhus 
( rivers ) follow the rta of Varuna ' ( rtam smdhavo Varunasya 
yanti, Bg. U 38 4), similarly Ug I 105 13 (rtamarsanti sin- 
dhavah), The wheel of rta (i e the year) revolves round the 



2. For the conception of rta and the idea of sin in the Rgveda the 
following works may be consulted 'The religion of the Veda' byM. 
Bloomfield (pp 12, 125 ff) , 'Religion and philosophy of the Veda and Upa- 
mshads ' by Prof A. E Keith (pp. 35, 33-85 £c.) . 'The Vedic idea of sin ' 
by Dr. Henry Lefever (1935) One regrets to observe that Bloomfield's 
work is marred here and there by a certain levity of thought and expression 
out of keeping with the seriousness of the subject

heaven, correctly follows the path of rta ( rtasya pan- 

thanam- a nveti Sa dhu\Rg I 124 3); the young woman (Usas) 
does not destroy (or come in the way of) the light of rta (Bgl 
123 9 ); the sun is the bright and lovely face of rta (Rg vl 
51.1. 'rtasya sucidartetam-amkam); 'the path of rta became 
united with the rays' (Rg. I 136 %); 'when exhilarated by drink- 
ing this (Soma) Indra released for the sake of rta the concealed 
host of cows' (Rg. X 131 4, probably a reference to drought and 
subsequent rainfall). 

Many of the principal gods of the Vedic pantheon are 
described as the guardians, promoters or charioteers of rta. 
Mitra and Varuna rule over all the world by rta (Rg V. 63 7, 
rtena visvam bhuvanam vi rajathah) ; Mitra and Varuna, the 
protectors of rta, occupy a chariot (Rg V. 63 1), Mitra, Varuna, 
and Aryaman are said to be charioteers of rta (yuyamrtasya 
rathyah, VII 6612); they and Aditi and Bhaga are protectors 
of rta (Rg. VI 51 3) Agm is called 'the charioteer of rta' {ratal 
rtasya, Rg. M 2 8), the protector of rta, in Eg. 1. 1 8, EI 10.2, X 8.5, 
X 118.7 and rtavan (in Rg IV. 2.1). Soma is styled the protector 
of rta (in Rg. IX. 48 4, IX 73 8) and is said to support rta (IX. 
97.24 rtam bharat subhrtam carvinduh) In Rg. VH. 66.13 the 
Adityas* are said to be rlauxn (acting according to the fixed order 
of nature), Tlcyata (sprung from rta) and rtavrdb. (augmenting 
or rejoicing m rta) and further they are said to be fierce haters 
of anfta (what is opposed to rta). ' 

Rta is distinguished from sacrifice (yajfta). It is not any 
particular sacrificial rite itself nor the institution of sacrifice. 
It stands for the ordered course of sacrifice in general In Rg. 
IV. 3.4. Agni is styled rlaat (conversant with or observing rta) 
and is invoked to know the rta (of the sacrifice) ; in several 
verses we meet with the words 'rtena rtam' (e, g, in Rg IV. 3.9 
rtena rtam myatam-ila a goh\ V. 15.2 'rtena rtam dharunam 
dharayanta yajfiasya sake, V. 68.4 rtam-rtena sapanta 'conform-

correct course of sacrificial rites and 'rtam' the settled order in 
the universe. Soma is said to be the thread of rta spread on the 
daiapavdra (Rg. IX. 73.9 'rtasya tantnr-vitatah pavitra a). In

..the streams of the bright (soma) flow towards thee in the seat

straightforwardly first thought of the abode of Yajfia' , Rg. X 
37 1 (maho devaya tad-itam saparyata, 'offer this rta to the 
great God') 

The* conception of rta as a moral imperative occurs in 
several passages ]"tg 1. 90 6 (madhu vata rtayats madhu 
ksaranti smdhavah) 'the winds carry sweets, the riveib do the 
same to him who keeps rta', Rg V 12 % 'O Agm, that knowest 
rta, know rta alone (in me) .1 shall not resort to magic either 
by force or by duplicity, I shall conform to rta of the reddish 
bull (l e of Agni)'; Rg. X 87 11 'O Agm 1 may the evil spirit 
who injures rta by anrta be thrice bound m thy fetters' Yama 
in rejecting Yaml's advances says (Jig X. 10 4) 'What indeed 
we never did before (shall we do it now ?) ; Bhall we who have 
spoken rta (so far) now speak anrta ?' (rta vadanto anrtam 
rapema) 

In two or three instances rta appears to be almost personifi- 
ed and invoked as a divinity. 'O Agm I for us offer sacrifice to 
Mitra and Varuna, to the gods and to the great (brhat) rta' 
($g I 75 5). Similarly, in Rg X. 66 4 the great (mahat) rta is 
mentioned alongside of Aditi, Heaven and Earth, Indra, Visnu, 
the Maruts &c, 

Rta and satya were distinguished in several passages of the 
Rgveda For example, Rg. V. 51 3 speaks of the Visve Devas 
as 'rtadhltayah' (whose thoughts were fixed on rta) and 
'satyadharmanah' (whose characteristic is truth or whose dharmas 
are true). In Jjg. IX 113.4 rta and satya both occur and appear 
to mean almost the same thing In Bg X 190 1 rta and satya 
are distinguished as having sprung from 'tapas'. ifrta involves 
a wider conception and satya had originally a restricted mean- 
ing (viz truth or static order). The word anrta, however, is the

opposite of both, rta and satya as may be seen from Rg X. 10.4, 
Rg VH. 49.3 (Varuna who marks the safya and anrta of people), 
Rg. X. 124.5 (Varuna who separates anrta by means of rla). 
Gradually, however, the word rta receded into the back-ground 
and satya took its place even in Vedic literature, though here 
and there (as in Tai. Up, II 1 and 1.9.3) both rta and satya are 
found in juxtaposition. 

The sages of the Rgveda were acutely conscious oi sin or 
guilt and pray to the gods, particularly to Varuna and the 
Adityas, for forgiveness and for being freed from the consequ- 
ences of sin In this connection they employ numerous words 
such as agas, enas, aglta, duida, duskrta, drugdha, amhas. A 
few examples of the employment of these words may be cited 
here. The most frequent words are agas and enas, both of which 
appear to import sin in its deepest and most ethical sense, Rg, 
VII 86 is a hymn to Varuna in which there are several verses 
that breathe a deep and heart-felt consciousness of guilt. The 
sage begins in verse 3 by saying that all wise men of whom ho 
inquired told him the same thing viz. 'Varuna is angry with 
you'. Then the sage proceeds 'O Varuna 1 what is that great 
guilt (agas) (of mine) whereby you desire to injure your worship- 
per and a friend ? Declare that to me, then 1 shall quickly 
approach thee with an obeisance and be free from sin (enas). 
Cast away from us the transgressions (dtugdha) of our father 
and those that we committed in our own person;... free VaBistha 
(from guilt) like a calf from the rope (that binds it)'. In Rg 
Vn. 89.5 (almost equal to Atharva-veda VI. 51.3) the sage says 
whatever transgressions (abhidroha) we who are mere men have 
practised as against the divine hosts and whatever dtoumm, laid 
down by you we may have confounded through our ignorance 
(or heedlessness) do not destroy us on account of that guilt (ems) ' 
It will be noticed that in these verses the words $gas, ablnd,oha 
and muis are employed in the same verses and therefore practi-

sin (agas) we may have committed through heedlessness make 
us free from it before Aditi and loosen from us our sins (e?w&)

also seems to mean sin 'Apa nah sosucad-agham' (may our 
sins perish ) is the refrain ot Rg. 1 97. 1-8. 'O gods ! May your 
fetters and may sins (agham) be far away from us' (II 29 5, in 
which verse m the first half 'agah' occurs), X 117 6 (kevalagbo 
bhavati kevaladi) 'one who simply eats food alone (without 
offering to others ) reaps only sin'. 

Another word is amhas. The following passages may bo 
cited. In Rg II. 28 6 Varuna is implored 'remove amhas ( sin ) 
as one removes the rope from the (neck) of the calf; one has not 
the power even to wink without you ( your favour )' 7 It should 
be noted that in the preceding verse (II 28 5 ) already quoted tbe 
simile of the girdle is employed with regard to agas. 'May 
Indra take us away from amhas as persons on both sides ( of a 
river) call one who is going in a boat' (Rg HI. 32 14 ), 'No evil 
caused by the gods or by men reaches him from any side who 
worships .Agni with fuel, oblation or sacrifice 8 * Rg VIII. 19. 6 , 
'May Aditi, the mother of the affluent Mitra and Varuna, save 
us from all sin' (Rg. X 36. 3). 9 Rg. X 36. 2 also prays Heaven 
and Earth, the upholders of rta, to protect the sage from 'amhas'. 
Vide also Rg X 126. 2.

opposition to sadliu or rju. The Adityas are said to 'see inside

(the hearts of men) sins as well as good (thoughts and actions)' 10 
and it is added that everything though far-off is near to 
them who are kings. InRg.H. 27. 2 the Adityas are called 
'avninah' (free from vrjina). The Sun is said to maik among 
men their right and sinful deeds (Rg. IV 1 17). The same 
words (rju martesu vrjina ca pasyan) occur in Rg VI. 51. 2 and 
VH 60.2 about the Sun. 

The word Wfo* is often used in the Rgveda. It has already 
been shown how Varuna is said to mark the salya and anrla of 
men In Rg. VII 60 5 it is said 'these gods, Mitra, Aryaman 
and Varuna mark (or know) many sins; they flourish in the 
abode of rta' Rg. VII 66 13 calling Mitra, Varuna and 
Aryaman haters of anrta has already been quoted (inn. 4). 

The word 'dunta' is sometimes used in the sense of sin In 
Rg I 33 23 the waters are invoked as follows : n '0 waters 1 
carry away from me whatever sin may exist in me, whatever 
transgressions I may have been guilty of as regards my sensual 
appetite or whatever falsehood I may have uttered'. Here all 
three words 'durita, droha and anrta' are brought together and 
convey almost the same idea, viz. sin or guilt against the law of 
the Gods. In Rg 1. 185 10 Heaven and Earth are called father 
and mother and are invoked to save the worshipper from durita 
( sin ) which involves blame (patam-avadysd-duritsd ) 'Avadya' 
means 'garhya* ace. to Pan. HE. 1. 101. Rg. VII. 82. 7 states 
'Him neither aihhas (sin) nor durita nor worry reaches from 
anywhere to whose sacrifice you go, O Mitra and Varuna •*. 
In Rg. X. 126. 1 'amhas'- and 'durita' are brought together (na 
tam-amho na duritam devaso asta martyam) In Rg VHI 67 21 
the words amhati and rapas 12 seem to be employed in the sense 
of sin. 'Duskrta' (evil deed ) is used in the sense of sin in Rg. 
VHI. 47. 13 and in Rg X 164. 3 Agni is implored to keep far 
away from the worshipper all sins 13 . The word 'papa' generally 1 *

occurs in the Rg. in the sense of 'sinner' (Rg. VHX 61. 11, X. 
10 12,1V. 5. 5) or 'sinful' or 'evil' (Rg X 108 6, X. 164 5, 
X 139. 11) In Rg "VT1 32. 18, VH. 94 3, VUL 19 26 'papatva' 
occurs and appears to mean 'sinfulness' In the Brahmanas 
'papam* (neuter) occurs in the sense of 'sin' as in Sat Br. XL 
2 7.19; vide also 15 Ait Br 33.5 In the ITpanisads 'papam' 
means 'sin' (e g in Tai Up H 9, Chandogya IV 14. 3). 
Certain important modifications of the doctrine about sin and 
Karma were introduced in the Upanisads and the Bhagavadglta, 
which wil] be discussed later on. 

In spite of the voluminous references to the consciousness of 
guilt and sin in the Rgveda and to the transgression of divine 
laws briefly indicated above, European scholars were not want- 
ing who boldly affirmed that the idea of sm was altogether 
unknown to the Rgvedie sages. Vide S B E vol I p XXII 
where Ma^c-Muller replies 'the gradual growth of the concept of 
guilt is one of the most interesting lessons which certain 
passages of these ancient hymns can teach us ' 

How sin arises in the individual mind has been a 
difficult problem at all times 16 . Men are conscious of the 
sins they commit, though they may have no definite conclu- 
sions or theories about the origin of sin In the Rg VH. 
86 6 a sage 17 pleads with Varuna that sin is not due to a man's 
own power, but it is rather due to fate, to sura ( intoxicants ), 
to anger, dice or heedlessness and even dream state leads one to 
commit what is not right In the Kausltaki-brahmanopanisad 
( III 9 ) it is stated - 'the Lord of all makes that man 
perforin good works whom He desires to raise to higher worlds 

33 5 ( =VII 17. ) 

16. Christianity seems to have solved it by stating that the source oT 
actual sin is the Devil (Matthew 13 39) and by the legend of Adam's Fall (vide 
Romans 5. 12 'as by one man sm entered into the world and death by sin') it 
affirmed that there was a dose of original sin in all men In modern times 
many people don't accept the idea of 'original sin ' , for example. Sir Oliver 
Lodge says (in his article on 'Christian Doctrine') in Hibbert Journal 
for 1903-4 at p. 466 "As for 'original sin' or 'birth sin' or other notion 
oftbattlod Chat sits absolutely lightly on him (the man of to-day) 
As a matter of fact it is non-existent, and none but a monk could have 
invented it'

IV"] H(AO sin arises in men's minds 9 

than these and He makes that man commit bad deeds whom He 

wishes to drag down'." Here it appears to he suggested that 

some men are chosen by God for being saved and some are 

chosen for being damned. This sounds like the Calvinistic 

doctrine of pre-destination. In the Bhagavadglta (III. 36) 

Arjuna questions Srikrsna as follows: 'impelled by whom does 

a man commit sin as if constrained thereto by force, even though 

he does not desire to do so'? The answer given is (DX 37) 

'it is lust and anger springing from the element (nuna) of 

rajas (passion) that are the enemies of man in this world. 

In another place the Bhagavadglta (XVI. 21 ) says 'this 19 is the 

three-fold door or entrance to Hell that is ruinous to the 

self viz. lust, anger and greed ; therefore a man must shun 

these three.' But it must he said that this does not go to 

the real root of the matter. The question is why should 

carnal lust, anger or greed themselves arise in the 

mind of man. The only answer that is indicated is in 

accordance with the tenets of the Sarhkhya philosophy viz. that 

there are three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas which combine 

in various proportions in different men and that it is rajo- 

gima that is the cause of man's sinfulness In the Santi- 

parva, chap. 163, it is stated "that there are thirteen very 

powerful enemies of men beginning with anger (Jnodha) and 

lama (lust) and it is said that krodha springs from lobha (covet- 

ousness), which latter arises from ignorance (verses 7 and 11). 

But there is no satisfactory discussion of the origin of ignorance 

in that chapter. Gautama 19.2 observes 20 that 'man in this 

world is polluted by a vile action such as sacrificing for a man 

unworthy to offer a sacrifice, eating forbidden food, speaking 

what ought not to be spoken, neglecting lohat is prescribed and 

practising what is forbidden'. Yajnavalkya IE. 219 prescribes : 'by

omitting to do what is ordained, by resorting to what is con- 
demned (prohibited) and by not controlling the senses, man 
incurs fall (i e sin)' Manu XL 44 and Santiparva 34 2 are 
similar verses The MitaksarS explains that matters ordained are 
such as performing Sandliya (morning and evening adorations) 
and Agnihotra and what are condemned are such actions as 
drinking liquor Visvarupa explains that patatia (fall or sinful- 
ness) in Yaj HX 219 is not used in the technical sense attached 
to that word by Gautama 21 4 viz 'to be a paftta means to be 
deprived of the right to follow the lawful occupations of twice- 
born men,' but it is used only in the sense that the man so 
acting (as mentioned in Yaj HX 219) becomes liable to undergo 
prayascitta and that the words of Gautama (21.4) are restricted 
only to what aie called mahapatakas The word palaha is 
derived from the causal of the root 'pat ' Vide Medhatithi on 
Manu XI 54 'patakasabdah patayatHivyutpattyasarva-vyatikra- 
mesu vaitats' and Madanaparijata p 786 In ancient works 
the word patamya (meaning the cause of patand) has been 
employed as in Kp Dh S. 1 7 21 7 The Pr V (p 35) paraphrases 
patanTyam by 'patakani' and derives it from the root 'pat' 
(patati/anena th patamyam) with the addition of the termination 
'anlya' according to Pan HI 3 113 The word occurs also in 
Yaj H 210, HL 297, Sankha quoted by Visvarupa on Yaj, HI. 
237 (in prose) and other smrtis 

The enumeration of sinful acts and the classifications of 
sins into several degrees or grades has gone on from very anci- 
ent times In the B-g X 5 6 it is said 21 ' the wise made ( Jit 
chiselled ) seven limits , the man who goes against even one of 
them becomes sinful ' The Nirukta ( VL 27 ) explains that the 
seven sins indicated in this verse are ' theft, violating the bed 
( of the gui u ), murder of a brahmana, murder of a bhruna, 
drinking of liquor, continual performance of the same sinful act, 
telling a he as to a sinful matter '. Rg VH. 86 6 quoted above 
( in n 17 ) makes it clear that drinking surS. and playing with 
dice were regarded as sinful. From the Tai. S. IL 5 1. 2, 
V 3 12 1-2, Sat Br Xm. 3 1 1 and other Brahmana texts it 
appeals that the murder of a brahmana was generally regarded 
in early vedic times as the gravest of all sins, though in the 
Kathaka samhita ( 31. 7 ) it is stated that there is no sin as 



ffl) 'Ancient enumeration of sins li 

heinous as-kUling a bhrQna which is even worse than brahmana 
murder ) J2 . The Tai. Br. in detailing the stray of Ekata, Dvita 
and Trita who was made a scapegoat for. keeping off sins, 
enumerates the following sinners, viz. suryabhycdita ( one who 
sleeps on when the sun rises ), suryabhinimrukta ( one who slept 
when the sun set ), one who has black nails or teeth, agradidlmsii 
( one who married a younger sister while the elder sister was yet 
unmarried ), the elder brother remaining unmarried even though 
a younger brother has married, one who allows iiis sacred 
sacrificial fires to be extinguished, the killer of a brahmana. 23 . It 
may be noticed that most of these occur almost in the same 
order in £p. Dh. S. H 5. 13. 22 where it is M said that though 



22. Bhtunahaa is either a killer of a learned brahmana or the killer o* 
a foetus when its sex is not known. Vide H of Dh vol II, p. H8n and 
vol. Ill p 612n for quotations and explanations. It may be noted that the 
four mam prohibitions contained in the Decalogue (Exodus, chap 20 13-16 
and Dent. 5. 17-20 ) against killing human beings, theft, adultery and 
bearing false witness are to be found in all well-known religions or 
moral codes.

these actions-are not-to be styled pataniyas according to Ap. yet 
they cause impurity whioh being greater and greater in each

adds a few more sinners to those in the Tai. Br viz 
didhimpah (husband of an elder sister whose younger sister 
was married before her), paryahita (an elder brother 
before whom a younger brother kindled fires ), parmvidana ( a 
younger brother who takes his share of the ancestral property 
before his elder brother ),panvmm ( an elder brother before whom 
a younger brother takes away his share of the ancestral 
property). The Chandogya Upanisad 25 (V. 10. 9.) quotes a verse 
that declares that the five great sinners are the thief of gold the 
drinker of sura, the violator of the guru's bed, the murderer of a 
brahmana, and one who associates with any of the preceding 
four. The Br. Up. ( IV. 3. 22 ) mentions as great sinners the 
thief and the murderer of a bkruna. 

Coming to the sutras there is great divergence as to the 
classification of sins and the enumeration of sins in each class. 
The Ap. Dh. S. divides sins into two classes viz. pataniya (those 
that cause loss of caste), asualuxra (those that cause impurity 
though no loss of caste is caused). Ap. Dh. S (I. 7.21.7-11) states 
that pataniya sins are theft (of gold), crimes whereby one becomes 
an abhiiasta, complete loss (by neglect) of the Vedie learning 
that one secured by study, destruction of a foetus, incestuous 
connection with relations born of the same womb as one's father 
or mother and with the children of such persons, drinking of 
sura, intercourse with persons with whom intercourse is for- 
bidden, intercourse with the female friend of one's female guru 
(mother &c ) or with the female friend of one's guru (father &c.) 
and with the wife of any stranger, constant commission of 
immoral acts (adhaima) other than those already mentioned. 
Ap. Dh S. I. 7.21.10 notes that, according to some, intercourse 
with a woman who is not the wife of a guru is not a pataniya 
sin. Among acts which render a man impure are (Ap. Dh. S. I, 
7. 21. 12-18) the cohabitation of an Arya woman with sudras, 
eating the flesh of forbidden animals such as that of a dog or a 
human being or village cock or pig or other carnivorous animals, 
eating the excrement of human beings, partaking of food left 
by a sudra, and cohabitation by Arya men with apapatra

women. 26 According to some, those acts that are declared to be 
aiuakara are also patamgas. Ap. Dh. S. (1.7.21.19) states that 
acts other than those enumerated are also asucikara. Ap. Dh. 
S. (L 9- 24.6-S) enumerates those who are abhisasta, viz. one who 
slays a person belonging to the first two varnas (viz. brahmana 
and ksatriya) who had studied the Veda or who had been 
initiated for the performance of a soma sacrifice, one who kills 
a mere brahmana (though he may not have studied the Veda or 
be not initiated for a soma sacrifice), also one who destroys 
the embryo of a brahmana even though its sex be undisting- 
uishable, or slays a woman who is an alreyi (in her 
monthly course). The Vasisthadharmasutra divides 27 sinners 
into three classes, viz. those who ara enasmns, those 
guilty of mabapatakas and those guilty of upapatakas 
(I. 19-23). Among those who are styled enasvinal} are those 
mentioned in Ap. Dh. S. U, 5.12.22, with this difference that 
the 'brahmojjha*, who is included among 'patanvyas' by Ap. 
Dh S, 1. 7. 21. 9 is put among 'enasvins' by Vasistha. In Vas. 
20. 4-12 special prayasoittas for each of these 'enasvinah' 
(ordinary sinners ) are prescribed. The Mabapatakas (mortal 
•sins) according to Vasistha are five, viz (violating) a guru's 
bed, drinking of spirituous liquor, murder of a bhruna ( a learned 
brahmana), stealing gold from a brahmana and associating with 
a pahta. Those guilty of upapatakas (minor sins ) are : He who 
forsakes sacred Vedic fires, he who offends a guru, an atheist, 
he who earns his livelihood from atheists, and he who sells the 
soma plant. The Baudhayana Dhartnasufcra 28 (HI) divides 
sins into pataniya, upapataka and aiucikara. Among the first it 
cites making voyages by sea, stealing the property of a 
brahmana "tor misappropriating a deposit, giving false evidence

and also some of those that are mentioned by ap. Dh. S. (I, 7. 
21. 9-11) and Vasistfia I. 33 (such as nustika) and adds a few

jy-j Classification of sins *' 

The above statement about the classification of sins and. 
their inclusion among the several classes or -grades of sins will 
Sow hat among the early sutra works there was no general 
™ment about the nature and number of mahapatakas 
?££*» and other classes of sins, even though as early as 
the ChandogyaUpanisad the mortal sins had been declared o 
be five It must be supposed that that Upanisad' represented 
only one school of thought in the times of A P „ Baud, and Gaut 
who did not entirely accept the tradition of that Upamsad, but 
followed other divergent ideas. It is impossible to suppose that 
the verse quoted in that Upanisad is later than the Dharma- 
sutras of Ap., Gaut , Baud , and Vas 

It appears that E&tyayana 32 divided sinful acts into five 
classes viz. mahapapa (mortal sins), atipapa (the highest sins than 
which there is nothing worse), palaha (sins similar to maha- 
patakas), prasangika (due to association "or contact) and 
upapataJca (minor sins). The Bhavisya-purana also say3 that 
those sins that are declared to be equal to mahapatakas (by 
Manu and others) are called patakas Vrddha-Harlia also (IX. 
215-216) speaks of five kinds viz. mahapapa, pataka, anupataka, 
' upapapa and prakirnaka (miscellaneous) and states (IX. 216-218) 
that those sins which are said to be like mahapataka are patakas, 
that anupatakas are sins lesser than patakas, that upapStakas 
are lesser than patakas and ptdkirnaka sins are the least sinful 
of all. The Visnudharmasutra (33 3-5) -speaks of nine kinds of 
lapses viz. atipataka, mahapataka, anupataka, upapataka, 
jatibhramsakara (effecting loss of caste), sahkartkarana, 
(rendering one as degraded as a man of a mixed caste), apatrl- 
kaTana (rendering the perpetrator unworthy of receiving a gift), 
malavaha (causing defilement) and prakirnaka (miscellaneous). 
Atipatakas, ace. to Visnu Dh. S 34.1, are sexual intercourse 
with one's mother, daughter or daughter-in-law and the only 
expiation for them is entering fire. Manu omits the separate 
mention of atipataka and anupataka and includes most of them 
under those that he designates as equal to one of the four well- 
known mahapatakas. Katyayana quoted in the PrayaSeitta- 
muktavali of Divakara (folio 3 a) adds sexual intercourse with 
one's sister as atipataka to the three mentioned by Visnu

16 History of Dharmasastra I Vol. 

Hartta Dh. S (it appears) quoted by the Mit knew 33 of a variety 
c of patakas called anupataka, but from the way in which the 
several patakas are arranged it looks as if atipataka in Hartta 
was a lesser sin than mahapataka Manu (in chap XI) refers 
to all the kinds of patakas found in the Visnu-dharmasutra 
except atipatakas Usually five mahapatakas have been 
enumerated from the days of the Chandogya "Op (quoted on p. 12) 
viz brahmana murder, drinking spirituous liquor, theft (generally 
understood as theft of brShmana's gold), sexual intercourse with 
the wife of a guru and association with the perpetrators of any 
of these four (for a year 34 ) Vide Vas I 19-20, Manu XI 55, 
180, Yaj m. 227, 261), Visnudharmsutra 35 1-5, Vrddha-Hartta 
IX 174. Manu mentions certain sins as equal to Mahapatakas 
which are styled anupstakas by the Visnudharmasutra chap. 36 
The most elaborate treatment of all kinds of sins in the amrtis 
is found in Manu, Yaj and Visnu There is difference of opinion 
even among these three on certain points For example, Manu 35 
XL 56 says that forgetting the Veda, reviling the Vedas, giving 
false evidence, slaying a friend, eating forbidden food and food 
that is unfit for eating or should not be eaten, are lapses similar 
to drinking sura; while Yaj. HX 228 states that three out of these 
(viz reviling the Vedas, slaying a friend and forgettirg the Veda 
studied by a person) along with the reviling of a guru by attri- 
buting false faults are similar to the murder of a brahmana. 
The result is that there is an option as to the expiation to be 
prescribed for these sins.

IV ] Detmls of Mahaputatcas 17 

It would be desirable to give some details as regards each, 
of the mahapatakas and then to desciibe the other varieties of 
sins and then to set out the expiations prescribed for all of them. 
It should be noted that both the secular law of penalties and the 
ecclesiastical rules about expiations made a difference between 
a sinful act intentionally committed ( Mmatah ) and one com- 
mitted through ignorance or heedlessness and between an act 
done only once ( sakrt ) or done repeatedly ( asakri ) 

Brahmdlvatya Hatya or vadha ( killing ) is applied to an act 
which immediately or after some time results in causing loss of 
life directly without the intervention of any other cause. 36 . The 
Agnipurana (173 1), the Mit , the Prayascittaviveka ( p 47) 
and other works define what is meant by vadlia A. man may be 
the cause of the death of a brahmana in five ways, viz. he 
may himself kill (i e. he becomes the to/5 ), he may incite 
another to kill ( prmjojaka ) by ordering that other to do so { as 
a king or noble by ordering his servant ) or by imploring another 
to kill and giving advice about the killing, he may encourage 
another to kill by his own approval ( anumanta ), or by helping 
the killer when he wavers or by offering protection to the 
killer against others ( anugrahaka ) and by becoming a «tnii«a. 37 

The Mit on-Yaim. 227 and 243 (quoting verses from 
Paithlnasi) explains all these at length. For the definition of 
anugrahaka it relies on a verse of Manu ' Where many persons 
are armed and have a common purpose in -new, if even one of 
them kills a person, all of them are guilty of murder \ which is 
very much like sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. This distinc- 
tamjnto several degrees of killers is an ancient one and is based 
on Ap Dh. S. H. 11. 29. 1-2 'He who^ instigates, he who 
approves, and he who commits an act-these share its results in 
heaven and hell ; but he among st these who contributes most to

brahmana or any other human being or a cow died while a 
competent doctor was administering treatment to them by means 
of drugs, oils or food, or cauterization by cutting or by opening a 
vein the medical man incurred no sin i3 But if a quack pre- 
tending to know medicine administered such treatment and 
death followed, Yaj. H 242 prescribed various punishments. 
If a brahmana administers moderate corporal punishment to his 
son, pupil or wife for some fault and the son or pupil or wife 
suddenly dies he incurs no sin, according to the Bbavisyapurana 
and the Agnipniana.* 4 Gautama (II 48-50), ip. Dh S I 2 8. 
29-30, ManuVJU. 299-300 (=Matsyapurana227. 152-154), Visnu 
Dh. S 71 81-82, Narada (abhyupetyasu&rusa 13-14) lay down 
that the punishment should be administered with a rope or 
bamboo slip on the back (but never on the head or chest) and 
Manu (VDI 300) provides that if these restrictions were violated 
the punisher would incur the same guilt or punishment as a thief. 
Vide H. of Dh. vol H. pp 362-363 for this topic 

One important question that very much exercised the minds 
of ancient and medieval Dharmasastta writers is whether a man 
can kill a brahmana atatayin in self-defence without incurring 
any sin or punishment by the king. There is great divergence 
of views on this point, which has been dealt with at some length 
inH ofDh vol H pp. 148-151 and vol. HI pp. 517-518. The 
conclusion of the Mitaksars appears to voice the views of most 
writers that, if a brahmana comes as an atatayin (as an incendi- 
ary, as a poisoner, as a kidnapper of women or with the inten- 
tion of killing or wresting a field), then in self-defence one may 
oppose him without incurring any sin, but that if the brahmana 
offender meets death though the defender did not desire to kill

undergo a light expiation (i. e. he is not guilty of brahmana's 
murder).* 5 

Sutdpana (drinking of stita) has been held tobeamaha- 
patafca The word sura occurs several times in the Rgveda 
(e g. Eg 1 116 7, I 191.10, VH. 86 6, VIII. 2 12, X 107 9) Rg. 
VII. 86 6 quoted above (in note 17) clearly indicates that sura 
was looked upon by the Rgvedic singers as a cause of sin just 
as much as gambling Rg. I 116 7 (satam kumbhan asificatam 
surayah) read with Rg I 117.6 (satam madhunam) implies that 
madhu (honey or some sweet substance) might have been used 
in preparing sura Soma was a beverage to be offered to the gods 
and to be drunk by the brahmana priests and was sharply 
distinguished from sura (o g in Tai S II 5 11, Vaj S. 19 7, 
Sat Br. V. 1 5 28). The last furnishes the striking antithesis 
'soma is truth, prosperity, light, and si« 3 is untruth, misery, 
darkness'. It appears that long before the Katbaka Samhita 
brahmanas had come to regard the drinking of sura as very 
sinful [XII 12 'therefore the brahmana does not drink sura 
(with the idea) that (by drinking it) he may become affected by 
sin'] 4S The Chandogya Up. (V. 10.9) speaks of the drinker of 
sura as a pakta, while in V. 11 5 king 17 Aivapati Kaikeya makes 
the boast before the five learned brahmanas that had come to 
him for the knowledge of Atman Vaiivanara that m his 
kingdom there was no thief and no drinker of madya. Though 
Manu XI 54 enumerates the drinking of stita among the five 
mahapatakas, Ya). m. 227 speaks of the madyapa (drinker 
of madya) as one of the five great sinners. Therefore we must 
explain what is meant by sura and when surapana becomes a 
mahapataka. By Manu XI 93 suia. is said to be the refuse of 
food and Manu XI. 94 states that sura is of three kinds, viz that 
prepared from molasses, that from flour and that from madhuka 
flowers ( or from honey ). There is a great deal of discussion 
about sura in many of the digests and the propositions

established by most of them are«: (1) that all the three higher 
varnas are forbidden to drink the sura prepared from flour and 
drinking it is a grave sin (mahapataka) in the case of anyone 
belonging to the three first varnas , ( % ) All intoxicants > ( madya ) 
are forbidden to brahnianas at all stages of life (Gaut H 25 
Wdyam nityam brahmanah' and JLp. Dh. S. I 5 17-21); ? but a 
brahmana drinking sura of the gaudl or mSdhvi kind would not 
ba guilty of mahapataka but of anupataka (ace to Visnu ) ; (6 ) 
that intoxicants other than sura prepared from flour are not con- 
demned for ksatriyas and vaisyas; (4) the sudra was not for- 
bidden to drink any kind of intoxicant (including sura made 
from flour) ; ( 5 ) brahmacarins ot all varnas studying the Veda 
had to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. The Visnu Dh. S. 
(23 83-84) specifies ten kinds of madya (intoxicants) prepared 
from dates, jack fruit, cocoanuts, sugarcane &c and Pulastya 
quoted by the Mit on Yaj. HL 253, by the Prayascittaprakarana 
of Bhavadeva (p 40), the Prayascittaviveka of Sulapani (p. 90), 
Pr. Prakasa (folio 69 b) refers to eleven kinds of madyas apart 
from sura (dvadasam to suramadyam sarvesam adhamam 
smrtam). Vide H of Dh. vol. HI pp 964-966 for further disous- 
sion on intoxicating drinks. 

The Mit points out (on Yaj EX 253) that the prohibition 
against drinking sura applies to boys who have not yet been in- 
vested with the sacred thread and also to unmarried girls, since 
Manu XI 93 makes no distinction of sex but only forbids to the 
three first castes the drinking of sura and since the 
Bhavisyapurana 49 expressly forbids to a brahmana female the 
drinking of sura The Kalpataru appears to have held otherwise. 
But a woman and a minor had to undergo lesser prayascitta as 
will be shown below. Vas 21 11 and Yaj III 256 state that the

from flour) would not reach the worlds of her husband and she

would become in this world a bitch or a sow 5 " The Mit. 
remarks 51 on this verse that though a sudra is not forbidden to 
drink sura even the sudra wife of a brahmana should not drink 
sura 

Drinking suia means taking it down the throat There- 
fore if a man's lips only touch sura or if sura enters his mouth 
but he spits it out, then there is no drinking of sura ( i. e no 
mahapataka ) and he would have had to undergo in such a case a 
light expiation for the touch of sura 52 . 

Steya (theft). In order to constitute theft as a grave 
sin according to the commentaries the theft must be of a 
brahmana's gold of a certain quantity Steya is defined by 
Ap Dh S I 10 28 1 as 5 * 'a man becomes a thief by coveting 
another's property (and taking it) in whatever situation he 
may be (without the owner's consent)' Katyayana (810) 
defines 51 it as 'depriving a man of his property, whether 
clandestinely or openly and, whether by night or by day, is 
known to be theft'. Vyasa defines it similarly. Vacaspati in his 
bhasya on Yogasutra IT. 30 defines steya as taking property from 
another in a manner that is not allowed by the sastras (steyam- 
asastra-purvakam dravyanam paratah svlkaranam). Though 
Manu ( XL 54 ) and Yaj ( IH 227 ) simply employ the word 'steya* 
(theft) or 'stena* (thief) yet in speaking of the prayascitta

P? ] Stej/a as Mahapataka 23 

for steya Manu (XI. 99 'suvarnasteyalcrfc') and Yaj. IE, 257 
(brahmanasvarnaharl) add the qualification that he should be 
a thief guilty of stealing gold (from a brahmana, aoc. to Yaj ). 
Vas. 20. 41 and Cyavana (q byPr V. p. 117 ) mention 'brahmana- 
suvarna-harana' as a mahapataka and the Ssmavidhana Br. (I. 
6. 1 ) also employs the words 'brahmanasvam hrtva'. Vide 
Samvarta 123 and Visvamitra (q. byPr. V. p. 108). A further 
qualification was added by Visvarupa (on Yaj HI. 252 
'anakhyaya &c ), the Mit. (on Yaj. HI. .257 }, the Madana- 
parijata (pp 827-28), Prayascitfeaprakarana (p. 72), the 
Prayascittaviveka (p 111) and other commentators that the 
gold stolen must be at least sixteen ynasas in weight, otherwise 
there is no mahapataka". So, if a man steals gold belonging to 
a brahmana which is less than 16 masas or steals gold of any 
weight (e-ren more than 16 masas) from a non-brahmana (i, e. 
from a ksatriya or the like) he would be guilty only of a minor 
sin (upapatalca). The Mit relies on the verses of Yaj. I 362-363 
for the technical meaning of suvarna (as 16 masas) There was 
no guilt of theft ace. to Yarsyayani if (Ap. Dh. S. I 10. 28.2) a 
person took only a small quantity of cereals ripening in pods 
(such as mudga, mSso and gram) or took grass for his oxen while 
he was going (in a cart.*) According to Gautama 12.25 a man 
may take (without permission and without incurring the guilt 
of theft) for the sake of cows and for the sake of irauta or smarta 
fees grass, fuel and flowers of trees and plants as if they were 
his own property and the fruits (of trees and plants) that are not 
fenced around Manu Yffl. 339 (=Matsya 227. 112-113) is almost

'father' as stated by the Mit. on Yaj HT. 259. Ace to many

Prakarana (p. 80) takes gurvangana 59 as a LarmadhSi aya 
compound, following what is called the nisMastliapatwajaya (Jai. 
VI. 1 51) After quoting Devala's dictum B that there are 
eleven persons among males who are to be'looked upon as gurus, 
and adverting to the way in which the word 'gurvangana' is 
explained by the Pr Prakarana, the Prayascitta-viveka expresses 
its dissent from the views of the Pr. Prakarana and holds that 
'gurvangana' or 'gurupatnl' means not only one's mother but 
also one's step-mother of the same varna as the father The 
MadanapSrijSta (p. 835) holds the same view as the Pr V The 
Pr. M. p. 73 finds fault with Bhavadeva (author of Prayascitta-

an express extension of the sin of gurutalpagamatuxto intercourse 

with one's teacher's wife, or one's daughter and other neariy 

Telated women. This would have been unnecessary^ if 

guuitcdpa was primarily meant to include the teacher's wife; 

while the Pr. V. relies upon Gaut. II. 56 ('the acarya is the most 

eminent among gurus, some say that the mother is so'), Visnu 

Dh. S. 81. 1-2 'three persons are ahgurus (exceed even guru in 

their greatness) viz. the mother, the father and the acarya and 

Devala who mentions eleven parsons as gurus. The Pr. M, does 

not seem to be quite correct since the Pr. V. ultimately (pp. 

134-135) states its final view that guru here means only the 

father and not the acarya and others and that Visnu Dh. S. 36- 

4-8 holds that sexual intercourse with the wife of the teacher 

and several other women lelatives is an anupataka. 

Mdiapatalasaihsarga. — Association with tbose who are guilty

H. of Dh. vol. m. pp. 614, 944. Gaut. 31.3, Vas. I.

Visnu Dh. S 35.3, Agnipurana 170. 1-2 prescribe briefly 
that one who closely associates or dwells with any one of the 
four grave sinners for one year himself incurs mahapataka w 
and they add that this applies when a man occupies the same 
conveyance ot same seat (as the sinner) or dines in the same row 
(with the sinner), but that if a person enters into spiritual 
relationship (such as that of teaching the Veda to the sinner or 
learning it from him or of officiating as a priest for him or 
allowing him to officiate as a priest for himself) or into a sexual 
or matrimonial alliance with him (i. e. a man who cohabits with 
a woman that is a grave sinner or if a woman cohabits with a 
male that is a great sinner or if a man marries the daughter of a 
pattta or if a woman marries a bridegroom that is paltta) that 
person becomes guilty of mah apataka at once. Brhaspati speaks*!

of nine kinds of saihsarga (contact or association) out of which 
the first five were treated as light sins, but the other four were 
serious viz. occupying the same bed or seat, taking food in the 
same row with the sinner, cooking food m the sinner's cooking 
pots or partaking of food prepared by him, being his sacrificial 
priest or employing him as one's sacrificial priest, being the 
sinner's teacher of the Veda or employing him as one's teacher of 
the Veda, sexual intercourse, taking food with him inthe same pot. 
The Pr Prakasa (folio 74a) holds that samsarga is of three 
kinds, the highest, middling and lowest. The first includes four 
viz. yonisambandha (marriage), srauva (i e that due to 
sacrificing for a sinner or making him a priest), maulcha (about 
learning or teaching Veda) and eating of food from the same 
vessel (ekamatrabhojana), the middling is of five kinds viz. using 
the same vehicle, seat, bed or coverlet , eating in the same row 
and learning the Veda together ( sahadhyayarta ) The lowest is 
of various other kinds such as intimate talks, touching, cook- 
ing food in the same vessel, eating food at his house, receiving 
a gift from him &c Adhyapana in order to be a great sin must 
relate to the Veda, and so also yajana must relate to such Vedic 
sacrifices as DarsapSraamssa, Caturmasya, Agnistoma Helping 
a mahapatakin to perform the five daily yajfias or teaching him 
the angas (metrics, grammar etc.) and the sastras is only a minor 
sin. Parasara 62 (XH. 79) states that sins are transferred (or 
spread) from man to man like a drop of oil on water by sitting 
or sleeping together or by using the same conveyance or by 
speaking with or dining in the same row. Devala and Chagaleya 
q. by the Mit. on Yaj. HI 261, the Pr. Prakarana (p. 101), the 
Pr. V. (p. 145), the Par M. (II. part 1. p 28) and others contain 
similar verses. Ace. to Pr, Prakasa (folio 75a), in order to 
become paltta one must simultaneously practise these four 
together, if practised separately, there is nopatttya but only dosa. 
Parasara (I. 25-26) states that in the Krta age a man became 
patita by speaking with a paltta, in Treta by touching him, in 
Dvapara by partaking of food prepared in his house and in Kali 
by actually committing a sinful act and that in the Krta age a 
district was abandoned (if any one therein became patita), in 
Treta the village, in Dvapara the family (of the pahta was 
abandoned) and in Kali only the actual perpetrator himself (is

i abandoned as patila). It is clear from this that such contacts 
with a patita as speaking with him, 63 touching him or eating 
food (in the house of a patita) were not regarded as involving 
a man in the same sin as that of the actual perpetrator. Speak- 
ing, touching and eating are also actions {karman) and 
Parasara did not include them in the word 'karmana' which 
refeis only to the actual perpetration of a murder, surapana etc. 
Therefore when some writers include such contacts as eating 
or touching under 'karmana.' they put two meanings on the 

' word karman in Parasara viz. perpetration of a murder or the 
like and also doing some of the acts (touching, eating) which 

• are forbidden to he done in reference to a perpetrator by some 

' stnrtis. This is a procedure which is against the maxim of the 
Mtmamsa that the same word conveys only** one sense in the 
same context The reasonable inference from the words of Parasara 
is that merely touching a maliapatakm or eating food in his house 
did not involve the toucher and eater in pahtija. In spite of this 
medieval writers gradually extended the scope of samsarga in a 
spirit of exclusiveness and of over-emphasis on ideas of 
ceremonial purity For example, the Smrtyarthasara 65 (p 112) 
remarks that he who associates with the person that associates 
with a mahapatakin has to undergo half the expiation 
that the first associator has to undergo. But that 
work does not go beyond this. The Mit. (on Ysj HI 261) 
appears to hold that the associator even though he does not be- 
come patita is liable to undergo expiation and that even the 
4th and 5th associators in a series are liable to undergo expiation

though it is lesser and lesser 66 . The Pr. Prakarana (p 109), 
Pr V. (pp 169-170) and the Pr T. (p 547) quote certain 
verses of Apastamba and vyasa which very much widen the 
circle of samsarga. Apastamba-srarti 67 (HI. 1-3) states, 'if a 
candala stays in the house of any one of the four castes 
without being known, the latter on coming to know of the fact 
should undergo expiation, which is Candrayana or Paraka 
for a member of the first thiee varnas and Prajapatya for a siidra. 
Those who partook of cooked food in that man's house should 
undergo if roohra; one should prescribe one half of Krcchra for 
those who took cooked food in the house of the 2nd associator and 
for those who partook of cooked food in the house of these last one- 
fourth of Krcchra is piescubed'. So besides theoiiginal associator 
three more in succession were held to be liable for prayas- 
citta. Mercifully they stopped at the 4th from the 
original associator A few writers took a more reasonable 
view. The Par M (II part 8, p 90 ) remarks 68 that Parasara did 
not prescribe any expiation for samsaiga (with those 
guilty of grave sins) with the idea that in the Kali age

there is no blemish of sarhsarga and that it ia on account 
of this that in the enumeration of things to be avoided or 
not allowed in the Kali age (Kah-varjtja) another sinrti includes 
'pollution through contact with -a sinner* (as a Kalivarjya). 
The Smrtimuktaphala (Prayascitta pp. 897-98) echoes the very 
words of Madhava and quotes further authorities on the point 69 . 
The Niroayasindhu 70 holds that though there is blame in 
association with &patita the associator does not himself become 
pahta. As Yaj HI. 261 employs the word 'vatsaram' and as the 
accusative of time is, ace. to Panini, to be used only when there 
is *atijantasa7mjoga' of time and space ( distance ) it follows that 
th9 associator who is to undergo penance for contact must have 
been day and night in contact for a year. Devala employs the 
word 'sarvakahkam' in this connection. 

Though many crimes do not in so many words come 
within the words of the definitions of the mahapatakas the 
smrtis extend by analogy the same condemnation as 
the mahapatakas in three ways. For example, Taj. HI. 251 
expressly states that one who kills a ksatriya or vaisya 
engaged in (soma) sacrifice or a foetus or an atreyi 
woman has to undergo the same expiation as for brahmana 
murder (therefore this is v&canikalidesa). Yaj. HI 232-233 
extends the sin of gui idalpa-gamana to intercourse with 
several near female relatives ( such as mother's or father's sister). 
This is extension by tadrupya. The smrtis declare many actions 
as equal to ( sama ) mahapatakas in general or as equal to one of 
the mahapatakas. This is attde&a by samya. A few words 
must be said on this topic. The general rule is that the expia- 
tion for those lapses that are declared to be equal to a 
mahapataka is less than (i. e. half of ) what would be prescribed

for the mahapataka itself 7 '. And the penance for those that 
come under aftdesa of the vacamka or tadrupya kind is three 
fourths of that for the mahapataka itself. But it has to be noted 
•that there is, divergence of views about these in the sutras and 
thesmrtis Ace. toGaut 21. 10 giving 72 false evidence, backbiting 
about another's guilt that will reach the king, falsely accusing 
one's guru with a grave sin or crime are equal to mahapataka. In 
ManuXI 55 (=Agnipurana 168. 35) the last two of these three 
and false statement about one's, caste or learning or family (l e. 
saying that one is a biahmana when one is not) for securing pro- 
sperity or eminence are stated to be equal to brahmana's murder. 
Ace to Yaj. HI 228 falsely charging one's guru is equal to 
bralimxhatga and false statement aboi.t one's caste or learning is 
equal to drinking sura (Yaj. HI 229 ), while ace. to Visnu Dh. S 
37. 1-3 the three sin's mentioned m Manu XI. 55 are to be in- 
cluded among minor sins (upapalakas), while giving false evid- 
ence is declared by Visnu to be equal to drinking sura ( 36. 2 ). 
No useful purpose would be served by dilating at great length 
on the divergences of smrtis on what lapses are equal to one of 
the Mahapatakas. The digests explain that where the same lapse 
is described as equal to surapana by one smrti and as equal 
to brShmana-murder by another the idea is that there is an 
option as to the penance prescribed for that lapse. There- 
fore only the remarks of Manu and Yaj. will be set out here. 
Manu XI. 56 ( =Agnrpur3na 168. 26 ) prescribes that forgetting 
the Veda ( already studied ), reviling the Vedas, giving false 
evidence, killing a friend, eating forbidden food or food 
that should not be eaten, these sis are equal to surapana. 
Vide Yaj III 228 already referred to above. Manu XI. 57

land or diamonds and other gems is equal to the theft of 
brahmana's gold. Yaj. HI. 230, Visnu Dh S. 5 383, Agni-

be equal to the violation of a guru's bed. Yaj. IH. 231 is 
practically the same (but he adds intercourse with a sagotra 
woman to the list). Gaut. 23. 12 and Mauu XL 170 are very 
similar. Yaj. ID, 232-233 declare that a man who has sexual 
intercourse with a sister of his father or mother, with his 
maternal uncle's wife, with his daughter-in-law, with a co-wife 
of his mother, with his sister, with the daughter or wife of his 
Vedic teacher or his own daughter, is guilty of being a violator 
of the guru's bed and should have his penis cut off and be killed 
(by the king) and the woman concerned, if she was a willing 
party, should also be killed. Narada (strlpumsayoga, verses 
73-75 ) 73 states: "If a man has sexual intercourse with any of 
these women viz. mother, mother's sister, mother-in-law, 
maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, a wife of the paternal 
uncle or of a friend or of a pupil, a sister, sister's friend, 
daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of one's Vedic teacher, a 
woman of the same gotra, one who has come for protection, a 
queen, an ascetic woman, one's wet-nurse, a woman performing 
a vrala and a brahmana woman, he becomes guilty of the sin of 
the violator of the guru's bed (i. e. incest). For that crime no 
other punishment is laid down except that of the cutting of the 
penis." These two, Yaj. and Narada, show that excision of the 
organ and death are both the expiation and the punishment for 
this crime. The Mit. (on Yaj m. 233) adds that this punish- 
ment applies only to the offenders other than a brahmana, since 
Manu (Vm. 380) prescribes that a brahmana offender should 
not be punished with death whatever sin or ctime he may have 
committed and that he is to be banished from the country

designated as patakas by Vrddha-Hartta (IX. 216-17) and by 
the Mit. (on Yaj. HI 233) and as anupBlahns by the Visnudharma- 
sutra (36.8). Gautama 7s (21.1-2) adds a few moro to the list of 
patakas or jxUttat via. ho who has connection with the female 
relatives of his mother or father or with sisters and their 
offspring, a thief of gald, an athaist, one who constantly repeats 
censured acts, one who does not cast away a pnttta or who 
abandons blameless rolativos or those who instigate others to 
commit patakas. These patakas are loss than mahapatakas in 
their culpability and greater than upapatakas. 

UpapalalMS (minor sins). The numhor of those has greatly 
varied from time to time and from smrti to smrti. Vas I 23 
speaks 78 of only five upapatakas viz. forsaking the sacred fires 
(after beginning Agnihotra), offending tho guru, being an atheist, 
taking one's livelihood from an atheist, selling the soma plant. 
Satatapa as quoted by Visvarupa on Yfij. HI. 229-236 mentions 
only eight. Baud. Dh. S. (II 1 60-61) mentions a small number 
as upapatakas. Gaut. 21.11 states 77 that the guilt of upapataka 
attaches to those who have been declarod to defile the company 
at a Sraddha dinner and have been named above before the 
bald roan (in Gaut. XV. 18), killers of kine, those who 
forgot the Veda, those who pronounce Vedic texts for these last, 
Vedic students who broak the vow of ohastity and those who 
allow the time for upanayana to pass without performing it. 
Sankhs quoted by Visvarupa on Ya] III 229-236 mentions only 
18 upapatakas and styles them upapataniyas The longest lists are 
contained in Manu XI 59-66, Yuj HI 234-242, Vrddha-Harlta IX.

jy-j last of upapatakas 35 

The above list, though long, is not thoroughly exhaustive 
Vas I IS quoted above mentions several persons as enasmnah 
(who ace. toYi&varupaonYa] HI. 229-236 are upapataldnah ), 
some of whom ( such as one who is asleep when the sun rises 01 
sets ) are not included by Yaj. in his list of upapatakas. Though 
almost all of the upapatakas listed by Ya3 occur in 
Manu ( XI 59-66 ), yet some of them such as * abhicSra ' { per- 
forming a sacrifice like SyenaySga for the destruction of an 
enemy ), ' mulakarma ' (employment of herbs for bringing under 
one's control a person ) are not noted by Yaj The Mit on Yaj. 
III. 242 observes that some upapatakas if repeatedly indulged in 
make a man pabfa (as provided by Gaut 21. 1) Yisvarupa, there- 
fore, derives upapataka as one 'that may become a pataka by 
constant addition (upacaya) or by constant practice' {upetyaP ). 

Manu XI. 67 (=AgnipuTana 168 s6 . 37-38) and Vismi Dh. S. 
38 1-6 mention certain lapses as 'jatibhramsakara' ( that cause 
the loss of caste ) viz giving pain to a brabmana (by means of a 
stick or by the hand }, smelling things which ought not to be 
smelt at (such as garlic, ordure &c. ) and smelling spirituous 
liquor, cheating (saying one thing and doing another), an 
unnatural offence with a man (or beast also, ace to Visnu) 
According to Manu XI 68 (= Agnipurana 168 38-39 ), killing a 
donkey, a horse, a camel, a deer, an elephant, a goat, sheep, 
fish, a snake or a buffalo must be known to be sankarikarav-a 
(reducing one to a mixed caste). Visnu 29. 1 says 
that sankarlkarana is the killing of village or forest 
animals. Manu XL 69 holds that accepting presents 
from condemned men (such as those mentioned in Manu IV. 
84), trading, serving sudras and speaking a falsehood make 
a man unworthy to receive gifts (apalrlkarana). The Visnu. Dh. 
S. 40. 1 adds 'maintaining one's self by usury' to these. Manu 
XI. 70 prescribes that killing insects, small or large, or birds, 
eating any thing kept close to spirituous liquors, stealing fruits, 
fuel and flowers and unsteadiness of mind are malaidha (which 
make a man impure). Visnu Dh. S. 41. 1-4 are similar. Visnu 
Dh. 8. 42. 1 says all other lapses not specifically mentioned in

the several kinds are styled miscellaneous (praklrnaka) Vrddha- 
Harita (IX. 210-215) specifies several lapses as praklrnaka viz- 
cutting big trees for fuel (used for cooking one's food), killing 
insects, big and small , eating of food that has become uneatable 
owing to bhava w (1 e its resemblance in colour or flavoui to 
some forbidden food 01 because it is offered with disrespect) or 
kcUa (food on ekadasi or in an eclipse, 01 in a mourner's house 
&c or that is stale) or faiya (action, such as food served with 
the bare hand or seen by a palita, carujMa or a dog &c ); theft of 
clay, skm, grass, wood, over-eating, falsehood , restlessness about 
pleasmes , sleep by day , spreading false rumours ; making otheis 
hear false rumours , eating at another's house , sexual intercourse 
by day , seeing women in their monthly illness or just after 
delivery, looking at others* wives; sexual intercourse on a fast, 
on a sraddha day, on a paraan day; service of a audi a; friend- 
ship with the low, touching the leavings of food; broad laughs 
with women, talking at random (or 3ove prattle), looking at 
women that have untied their hair It will be noticed that some 
of these like the cutting of big trees for fuel, service of a sudra, 
friendship with low persons have been already included by Y&j 
under upapatakas 

Having dealt at length with seveial classes or grades of 
sins, we have now to address ourselves to the question of the 
consequences of sins and the means recommended or adopted 
for removing sin and its consequences. 

It has already been shown above how the sages of the 
Rgveda prayed to the gods, particularly to Adrti, Mitra, Varuna, 
the Adityas and Agm to free them from agas or enas etc. 
They often say that they violated the dharmas or the malas 
(ordinances) of the gods and lmploie forgiveness They were 
afraid of the consequences of their guilt, viz. the god's anger. 
They thought that when God was angered by their transgres- 
sions he smote them with 'adversity, destruction, disease and 
death. For example, they prey 'whatever ordinance (vrata) of 
yours we may violate every day like subjects (m the case of a 
king's ordinances) do not subject us to yonr death-dealing blow' 
(Rg L 25 2) , 'O Varuna 1 whatever transgression we men have 
committed towards the divine host and whatever rules of youra 
We may have confounded through heedlessness, do not, on

account of that sin (e««4' strike tu down' (BS.VH.89 5F. In 
U« X 89.8-9 it is said that India tails his sharp and deadly 
weapon at thoss who break the settled order (dharman) of Mitra, 
Yaruna and Aryaman. The gods are implored to save the 
worshipper from the deadly attacks of the wolf and from sinking 
into a pit (in adversity) in $g. D. 39.6. In 8g. IX. 73.8 it is 
said that the wise God has Ms eye on all worlds and he pierces 
in pits those who do not observe his ordinances and who are 
therefore not liked by Mm 8 *. On the other hand, when God is 
pleased with the worshipper, ho is imploied to lead the latter by 
the path of vutue (Rg. 1. 189.1), to confer happiness on the wor- 
shipper's offspring (Bg 1. 189 3,1V, 12.5) and to bestow wealth on 
bimtftg Yin. 45 40). 

In the Bgveda the first means of removing the consequences of 
sin appear to be prayers for mercy and for the remission of sin as 
in Rg. YH. 86. 4-5, YD. 88. 6-7, YE. 89, 1-4 (where 'mrla suksatra 
mrlaya' is the refrain of all f our verses). Even in the Jlgveda 
water was supposed to remove sin, e g. I 23. 22 says 'O water ! 
carry away whatever sin (dunla) may exist m me'. This shows that 
sin was supposed to have physical effects like a disease, which 
were removed by water. Sacrifices were offered to the gods in order 
to win their favour and in order that the sacrificer may be freed 90 
from the consequences of even grave sins. The Tai S. Y. 3. 12 1-2 
and the Sat. Br. X1H 3. 1. 1 (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 328) state that 
the gods redeemed themselves from all sin by means of this 
(Aivamedha sacrifice), they even redeemed themselves from 
the sin of brahmana murder. That a confession of sin was 
deemed to remove sin is illustrated in a striking way by what 
happaned in the Yarnnapraghasa (one of the calwrriasya 
sacrifices), hi that 91 sacrifice the wife of the sacrificer had to 
confess whether she had any lovers and if she felt ashamed to

reply in so many words she had only ta raise up in her hand 
small pieces of grass blades to indicate the number of lovers, if 
any. If she confessed she had to recite the verse, Vsj. S III ' 44 
and was allowed to take further part in the sacrifice If she con- 
cealed the truth, at was stated in the Tai. Br that evil would be- 
fall her near and dear relatives (her son or husband). It is said by 
many European scholars who have written on the religion of the 
Veda that sacrifice became a sort of magic rite to wrest from 
gods or independently of them what the worshipper desired { e g, 
see Keith's Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and TJpamshads 
pp. 260-268) 92 But this is an over-statement When initiated 
for a sacrifice the sacrificer and his wife had to observe a fast 
or live on a low diet, both were called upon to observe many 
strict rules such as telling the truth, they had to make large 
preparations and spend wealth on the materials and the fees to 
the priests. These things were deemed to cleanse the mind and 
soul of the taint of sin. There is no reason to suppose that it 
was only the ritual that wa3 thought to bring about the desired 
result (and not all the other matters referied to above). 

We shall now discuss the prescriptions of the sutras and 
smitis about the consequences of sins. 

In this connection the doctrines of Karma and Pwvxrjanma 
must be well remembered The details of the origin and develop- 
ment of those doctrines will be discussed m a later section. 
Here it is enough to state the few main propositions of the 
doctrine of Karma The fundamental proposition is that cause 
and effect are as inseparably linked m the moral sphere 
as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has 
its reward and a bad act leads to retribution. If the bad actions 
do not yield their consequences at once or in this life, the soul 
begins another existence and m the new environment undergoes 
suffering for its past bad deeds The theory of karma and 

92. Christ gave a model prayer to his disciples in Lute 11 2-4 and 
Matthew 6. 9-13, where after invoking the heavenly Father the first thins 
asked for is the daily bread, then the forgiveness of sin and deliverance 
from evil Pious Christians have an easy and complacent self-assurance of 
getting the things prayed for, since Christ himself has said that they have 
only to ask and it shall be given to them (Luke 11 9) This also is a sort of 
magic but it is simple as compared with elaborate Indian sacrifices It 
seems rather perverse for a Christian «ho believes in Lute II 9 to say that 
if an Indian believes that a sacrifice will yield some reward it is all magic and 
nothing more. 



TV] Karma and punarjanma 39 

the theory of transmigration of souls (of pre-existenoe and 
post-existence) are inextricably mixed up in Indian thought 
from at least the ancient times of the Upanisads. The 
general rule is that Karma, whether good or evil, cannot b8 got 
rid of, except by enjoying or undergoing its consequences. This 
is said by Gaut. 19. 5, Markaudeya-purSna and many other 
works. 'Beoause the deed does not perish' Gaut. 93 ; 'whatever 
human action it may be, whether good or evil, it cannot be got 
rid of except by enjoying its consequences; know from me that 
a man gets rid of good and evil deeds by enjoying (their con- 
sequences)'. This doctrine is based on the Sat. Br. V. 2 3.27, 
Br. Up IV. 4 and VI. 2, Chan. Up. HI. 14, and V. 3-10, Katha 5. 
6-7 and other Upanisad texts. 

Therefore they say, 'a man is born 'again in that world for 
which he has worked.' ' According as a man acts and accord- 
ing as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will 
be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful He becomes pure by 
pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that a 
person consists of desires And as is hi3 desire, so is hid will ; 
and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does' 
that he will reap' (Br. Up. IV. 4. 5); 'a man is made up of will ; 
whatever he wills in this world the same he becomes after 
departing from this world' (Chan. Up. Ht. 14, 1); ' some bAu^ 
bemgs enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence- 
others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) 
according to their deeds and according to their knowledge' 
(Katha Up. 5. 7), ** 

•Actions done by a man do not perish unless they (i e their 
consequences) are enjoyed even after crores of years, (the 'fruits 
of) actions whether go od or evil must of necessity be enjoyed".'

'just as a calf finds out its own mother from among thousands of 
cows, so actions done in a former life unerringly reach the 
perpetrator thereof.' 

But this general principle was modified in vanou? ways by 
the smrtis and later writings. Gautama 19.11 96 (=Vasistha 22. 8) 
states- 'Reciting the Veda inaudibly (japa), austerities, a sacnfice, 
fasting and giving gifts are the means of expiating that ( i e. a 
blamahle act) ' Vas. 20. 47 and 25. 3 lay down 'A sinner is freed 
fiom sin by tormenting his body, by austerities, by reciting 
the Veda and also by making gifts' and 'those who are constant- 
ly engaged in pranayamdb (suppression and regulation of breath), 
reciting purificatory texts, giving gifts, offering sacrifices, 
muttering sacred texts "will undoubtedly be freed from sins'. 
Manu ICL 227 observes, 'by confession, by repentance, by austerity, 
by reciting Vedic texts (sacred Gayatrl or other texts), a sinner is 
freed from guilt and in case of difficulty (i. e. if he is unable to 
perform austerities or to recite Vedic texts) by liberality'. Similar 
provisions occur in Parasara X 40, Satatapa T. 4, Samvarta 203, 
HarltaU.inPr.T.p 467), Tama, (q. in Pr. V. pp 30, 31), 
Bhavisyapurana (q. by Pr. V. p. 31 ) 

Before proceeding with the subject of prayascittas we shall 
speak briefly about the other means of leducing the con- 
sequences of sin And fir=t comes confession With reference 
to the confession of paramours by the wife in the Varunapraghasa, 
the Tai. Br. (1 6. 5. 2) w says 'He makes the wife confess, there- 
by he renders her pure and then he leads her to penance'. The 
Sat. Br. (II 5. 2, 20) puts it in this form 'for when confessed the 
sin becomes less, since it becomes tiuth'. This was a confession 
before God (Fire) and men (the priests ) to restore one to divine 
forgiveness and favour As regards several lapses, confession 
was part of the procedure prescribed for atoning for the sin.

ft fa prescribed that the parson undergoing a penance for 
Jeing an rihfa* or for nnjustly forsaking hi. wfa or 
for the murder of a learned brahuiana has to declare his 
misdeed while begging for alms to support himself. The 
Vedic student who was guilty of sexual intercourse had also 
to proclaim his lapse while begging at seven houses (Gaut, 
23.18, Mamv XI 1M ) 98 

Repentance Ca««{apa)-Manu» XL 339-230 (-Vlsnudbarm- 
ottaxa H. 73 231-32 ) provide : " The more a man's mind loathes 
his own evil deed the more does his body become freed from the 
unrighteousness (committed by him). If after committing a 
sin a man feels repentance for having done it he becomes free 
from that sin. He becomes purified only by the resolution of 
ceasing to sin and thinking ' I shall not do so again 'V 00 The 
Visnupurana H. 6.40 lays emphasis on repentance and humble 
devotion to Krsna. Pr. V. (p. 30 ) quotes a verse of Angiras 
' A man aftar committing sms, if he is consumed by repentance 
and is sorry day and night (for his misdeed), is purified by 
pranayama '. The view of digests like the Pr. Prakasa is that 



98 Confession of sins has played a prominent part in early and medie- 
val Chrtsttamty, For example, (Fust epistle of) John I. 9 says *If we confess 
our sins, he is faithfnl and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from 
all unrighteousness, *. 

99. Manu XI. 229 also occurs in 4g|j(<|uj 218. 5. 

100. Compare Christ's call to repentance in Matthew 4. 17 and Marl: 
I 15 and his last words (in Luke 24 47) that 'repentance and remission 
oi sins should be preached in his name among all nations '. ^Jr%jr ***Wf

repentance by itsolf is not onough to destroy sine, but that 
repentance renders the sinners fit to recoive penance, just as 
paring the nails and the like make the person intending to 
perform a Vedic sacrifice fit to be a dihyla Yam a quoted by 
Apararka (p 1231) states that repentance and stopping from 
(repeating the sin are merely HasraAqas ( subsidiary elements ) 
of prayascittas and cannot independently take the place of 
penances. " 

Pi anuyama { rostraint of the breath ) Vide H of Dh. 
vol Up 317 for a description of this Manu XI 248 (which 
is the some as Baud. Dh S IV 1 31, Vas. 26 4, Atri TL 5, 
Sankhasmrti XII 18-19) lays down 'sixteen pranayamas 
attended by the Vyahrtis and the Pranava { omkSra ), if per- 
formed every day, would purify aftor a month even the murderer 
of a bhruna (a learned brahmana)'. Visnu Dh S. 55.2 (in prose) 
is to the same effect. Vas ZG 1-3 provide that on the proper 
performance of three pranayamas all the sins committed by 
day or in the night are at once destroyed Yaj. HI 305 states 
that for the removal of all sins, of upapatakas and of sins for 
which no special expiation is provided by the texts one hundred 
pranayamas should be performed. This refers to sins not 
known to others for which expiation is to be performed 
sccietly. Baud Dh. S (IV 15-11) provides for varying 
numbers ( 3, 7, 12 ) of pranayamas to bo spread over one day to 
a year for different kinds of sins ranging from the eating of the 
food of a sudra to brahmana murder This wholo passage is 
quoted by the Mit on Yaj 111305 which points out the kinds 
of sins it doals with The Agnipuiana 173.21 has the same half 
verso as Y5j, UI 305 ( first half ) 

Tapas (austerity) Even Rg X 154 2 speaks of laixts as 
loading to heaven and as unassailable. The Chan. Up V 10 
1-2, Mundaka Up 12 10-11 place tapas over i/ajrla Gaut 1915 
says, that celibacy, 101 truthfulness, bathing thrice daily (in the 
morning, at noon and in the evening), wearing wet clothes 
(till they are dried on the body), sleeping on the ground (on a 
raised part or altar) and fasting constitute austerities Baud 
Dh S BI 10 13 adds to these \ihtmsa' (non-injury to any being), 
a*lawva (not depriving any one of his property) and guiu- 
suii usa (attendance upon a teacher) Gaut. 19 17 states that

Soma (sacrifice into fire). The Tai. k. (H 7-8) describes™ 
the kusmanda homa and diksa and H 8 prescribes that the man 
whoregatds himself as impure should offer a sacrifice with the 
kusmanda numb as (mentioned in Tai S..H.3-6, viz 'yaddeva 
deva-hedanam" (Vb.j.8 SO 14-16 =Tai. A..11 3.1) The Maharnava- 
karmavipaka (folio 8 a) prescribes the procedure of Kusra&nda 
homa taken from Jamadagni which is brief. It is as follows.— 
After shaving the hair on the head and the moustache and 
taking a bath in holy water one should offer the ajyabhagas and 
then offer oblations of clarified butter with the three Amiuajcas 
beginning with 'yad devS. devahedanam,' and then he worships 
fire with the verses beginning with 'ValsvSnaraya pratipa- 
dayami* He then offers samidh with the mantra 'yadadlva- 
yam' and then he repeats the Jaya mantras. He has to observe 
the rules for a dlksita viz not eating flesh, avoiding sexual 
intercourse, not telling a falsehood and not sleeping on a cot. 
He has to subsist on milk (if he is a brahmana), on barley 
gruel if a ksatriya and on amiksa if he is a vaisya. The 
Kftsmanda-homa as prescribed by Bandhayaua is a longer one 
The Band. Dh. S. HI. 7 1 prescribes that he who considers himself 
impure should offer burnt oblations reciting the kusmanda 
mantras, that he who has had forbidden intercourse becomes 
even like a thief or even like a slayer of a learned brahmana

and that (by performing homa with kQsmandas) he becomes 
free from any sin that is less than the murder of a learned 
brahmana Taj HI. 309 provides that whenever a twice-born 
man feels himself mixed np in heavy sins he should perform a 
homa with sesame with the sacred Gayatrl mantra. The Mit 
following a verse of Yama says that one lakh of offerings of 
sesame must be made. Both Manu XL 34 and Vas 26 16 say 
that a brahmana becomes free from all distresses by Vedic 
recitations (japa) and sacrifices (homa). When the wife con- 
fessed to the existence of a paramour, the Sat. Br. IL 5 2. 20 
states that she made an offering into the Daksinagni with the 
mantra (Vaj S. BT 45) 'whatever 103 sin we have committed, 
whether in the village, in the forest, in society or by the organs 
of sense, we cast that away by this sacrifice, svaha.' Both 
Mann (vTH. 105) and YSj (n, 83) prescribe that when a witness 
tells a falsehood in order to prevent an accused person from be- 
ing sentenced to death, he should offer for expiating his perjury 
an oblation of boiled rice to SarasvatI There aTe other 
homas also prescribed such as the Ganahoma, in which such 
verses as 'ague naya supatha ' from the Taittirlya sakha are 
recited (Maharnava). 

The old idea of sacrifice seems to have been that it 
was propitiatory in character Sacrifice was not demanded 
or required by God. Sacrifice was probably regarded as a 
gift which pleased God, induced Him to forgive a man for 
his transgressions and enabled erring man to regain God's 
favour which had been lost by some shortcoming or some 
sinful act Sacrifices therefore had an expiatory or cleansing 
function or character. Sacrifices may be performd by offerings 
either an animal (meant as substitute for the sinner himself 
who had forfeited his life for his sins and transgressions) or a 
burnt offering or any other thing offered to God and then distri- 
buted to others. 

Japa (muttering of Vedic passages as prayers) Japa is of 
three kinds, oacika (audibly uttered ), vpam&u ( inaudibly 
uttered) and manasa (mentally revolved), each succeeding one 
being ten times superior, ace to Laghu Harlta IV. p 186,

(Jivananda L). 104 Sabara (on Jai. XH. 4. 1) distinguishes japa 

from stutt, the former being simply an utterance or recitation of 

a mantra or mantras 105 . Inaudible japa is praised 106 in 

Sankhayana Br. 14. 1. The Asv. Sr 1 1 20 provides that japa, 

anumantrana, apyayana and upasthana are uttered upUihiu. 

The Ap. Sr ( 24 1, 8-10 ) provides that mantras from the 

Rgveda and the Samaveda aTe uttered in sacrifices loudly and 

that passages of the Yajurveda are muttered upamsu and the 

Tai. Pratisakhya 23. 6 states that upamsu recitation is made 

by means of the effort of speech organs but without sound 

(i. e. in a very low voice) and without the mind being directed (to 

utterance with udatta and other accents) i e. 'Karanavad- 

asabdam-amanah-prayogam-upamsu'. Gaut. 19. 12 (= Baud. Dh. 

S. IBL 10 10= Vas 22 9) prescribes the following Vedic texts as 

purifiers: TJpanisads, Vedsnta texts, the Samhita texts of all the

original idea of japa was highly spiritual. Deep knowledge of 
the Upanisads and other texts would have made the soul pure 
and enabled it to realize the supreme reality and induced in the 
mind love of all human beings as spaiks of the one Divine 
Essence. Japa at the highest level was contemplation of God 
and endeavour to attain unity with God The habit of repeat- 
ing the sacred texts should lead to maintaining the sou] m the 
presence and thought of God Japa demands three things, 
purity of heart, detachment and placing oneself in the hands of 
God 

Manu XX 46 provides that a sin unintentionally committed 
isexpiattd by the recitation of Vedic texts as prayers, but that 
which men in their folly commit intentionally is expiated by

on inaudihly is a hundred times superior ( to sacrifices ) and 
mental revolution of mantras is a thousand times superior The 
four pakayajuas m (Vaisvadeva, bait, daily v addha, and hono- 
uring guest?) together with the Vedic sacrifices do not come up 
to even the 16th part of japa. A brahmana attains perfection 
(the highest goal) by japa; he may or may not engage in other 
duties (such as Vedic sacrifices), a brahmana befriends all 
creatures'. Great eulogy is bestowed on the inaudible japa of 
the Gayatrl mantia (Eg HI. 6210) for which pp. 303-305 of H

passages as specially efficacious for removing all sins It is not 
possible nor neoessary to set down all of them, Lut by way of

'Even a drinker of sui a becomes pure if he mutters the hymn 
(seen) by Kutsa m , the three verses beginning with 'piaW (Bg 
VTI 80 1-3) seen by Vasistha, the Mahitra hymn (Bg X 185), 
the verses called Suddhavatls (Bg VIII 95 7-9 where the word 
'suddha' occurs 13 times in different connections). Even he 
who has stolen gold (of a brahmana) instantly becomes free 
from guilt if he once mutters (the hymn) beginning with 'asya 
vamasya' i e. Bg L 164 1-52), and the Sivasankalpa (Vaj S 
XXXIV. 1-6). The violator of a guru's bed is freed from sin. 
if he repeatedly recites the hymn beginning with 'havispantam' 
( ftg. X 88 1-19 ) and the hymn beginning with 'na tam-amho" 
(i e. Bg X 126 1-8), the hymn beginning with 'iti' (i e. Bg X " 
119) and the hymn addressed to Pm usa (Bg X 90) He who 
desires to do away with sins, great and small, should mutter 
during a year the verse beginning with 'ava' (i e 'ava te he]o 
varuna namobhih* Bg I 24. 14, Tai S I 5 11 3), or the 
varse 'yat kim ca' (Rg VII 89 5) or the verse *iti va' (Bg X

beginning with 'tarat samandl' (Bg IX 58 l-4) m becomes pure 
after three days He who has committed many sins becomes

mantra 'nama id-ugram' (Rg. VL 51. 8) One who is stained by 
mortal sin becomes pure if with a concentrated mind he attends 
cows for a year, reciting the Favamani hymns (the whole of ftg. 
IX) and subsisting on alms 114a 

So much importance and such occult powers came to be 
attached to the words of the ftgveda that the RgvidhSna of 
Saunaka (which is later than Manu) concerns itself with 
prescribing numerous hymns of the Rgveda for the removal of 
various diseases, of sins, for the conquest of enemies 

The Sania Br L 5 2 says lls generally that when no parti- 
cular hymns are prescribed for the removal of sins Vedic 
mantras are powerful and become purifiers if accompanied by 
tapas and the Samans may be repeated for the same purpose 
from ten times as the minimum to 100 times as prayascitta. 
Gautama 19. 13 prescribes the kind of food on which one should 
subsist when one is engaged in japa viz. one was to live on milk 
alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only, to live on 
barley gruel prepared from a handful of ^grain, to eat gold 116 , 
to eat clarified butter, and to drink soma and so foith. Gautama 
19. 14 further lays down that all mountains, all rivers, holy 
lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (t&s), 
cowpans and temples of the gods are places (which help to 
destroy sin). 

As the Veda could be studied in and after the sutra perio d 
only by the male members of the first three classes, the japa 
of Vedic texts for the removal of sins 'was not possible for 
sudras ; therefore, the Mit. (on Yaj HI. 262) says that although 
the sudra (and women and those horn of pratiloma marriages 
also) has no adhtkara (power or capacity or authority) for the 
recitation of Gayatrl and other Vedic mantras, still the sudra 
and women after revolving in the mind the name of the deity 
put in the dative case can engage in. japa with the word namdh 
(i e he can only utter the words 'namo namah' and not om &c)

50 History of Dharmasasha [Vol. 

as stated by Gaut Dh S. X 66-67 and Ysj. I m u \ When 
Manu IV. 80 says 'let him not explain to a sudra the sacred 
law {dharma) nor impose upon him a vrata" all that is meant is, 
according to the Mit on Yaj EL 3G2, that it applies only to a 
sudra who does not wait upon or serve higher varnas Similarly, 
when Gaut IV. 20 says that those born in the inverse order 
are outside the pale of the sacred law, the meaning is that 
samslat as like upanayana aTe not to be performed on them. 
The mystic syllable 'om* is said by &p Dh S (14 13 6) to 
be the door to heaven and -was to be employed before the 
recitation of any Vedic passage The Yogasutra (1 27) avers'that 
om (called pranava) is expressive of the idea of God and that 
the repetition of om and revolving the meaning of it in the 
mind lead to concentration, 118 

Not only were certain Vedic hymns and passages recom-

works, particularly thePuranas, proposed an easy way for all viz.

removed all «ins The Brahmaptirana (chap. 176) contains 
a stotra (hymn of praise) of Visnu, which when recited is said 
to free a man from all sins (ment3l, vocal or bodily). The Pr. 
V. p 31 quotes a rerse from the Bhavisyapurana 11Sl * and three 
verses from the Visnupurana as follows. — 'even a great sin is 
removed by (the resolve of) not doing it again, by gifts, by 
confessing it to others, and by meditation (on Visnu) and not 
only by prayascittas' (Bhavisya) ; 'of all the expiations (for sins 
declared by the sages) such as tctpcts (Candrayana and others )

mormng bright, at twilight, at midday and the like, he at 
™ec; r es the removal of sin' (Visnupurana). The Brahma- 
purana 1 " (216. 87-88) gives expression to a popular beliei as 
follows— "Men, even after committing sins many times through 
folly do not go to Hell if they prostrate themselves before Hari 
who destroys all sins. Those men also who always remember 
Janardana even by roguery B o to the world of Visnu after death 
The Visnupurana affirms that those who contemplate upon the 
mantra of twelve letters ( viz. 'om namo bhagavate Vasudevaya ) 
do nob return to the cycle of birtbs and deaths. The great 
power of mantras is mentioned in the Adiparva (161. 14) by 
Kuntl. The Nrsimha-purana in chap. 18 eulogises the mantra of 
eight letters (om namo Narayanaya) and chap. 63.6> states "what 
is the use of many mantras and the performance of many vratas, 
■when the mantra 'om namo Warayanaya' is capable of securing 
all desired objects". The mantra of five letters ' namah Sivaya * 
is dealt with in Lingapurana (purvardha, chap. 85) and Saura- 
purana 65. Brahma-purana speaks of vaidiha mantras and 
agamoMa mantras (41, 63). The Nityacara-paddhati (p. 67) says 
that it ib necessary to understand the meaning of vedic 
mantras in srauta rites but in smaTta rites it is not so. 
1 Dana (gifts). Gaut. XIX. 16 provides 120 that gold, a cow, 
a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter and food are 
the gifts (that destroy sin) and may be optionally undergone 
as penance if no express mention is made thereof. Vas. quotes 
several verses on gifts one of which (29. 16) states: "whatever 
sin a man distressed for livelihood commits he is purified from 
that by giving land even if it be as small in extent as 
'gocarma' " m . Visnu Dh S. 92.4 is to the same effect. Sam- 
varta ia (204) prescribes that the gifts of gold, cow and land

.quickly destroy sins even if committed in former Hybb MedhS- 
.tithi (on Manu XI. 139) remarks that the verse implies that as 
to sins arising from injury to living beings gifts are the princi- 
pal expiations. The subject of dam has been dealt with at 
length in H. of Dh vol II pp. 837-888 A few further remarks 
may be made here In many inscriptions and copperplate 
grants of lands or villages the donor usually states that the grant 
is made for the increase of the merit of himself and of his 
parents (e g. E. I vol. XL p. 219 at p 221). Brhaspati 1 * as 
quoted in the Madanaratna (vyavahara p 66) expressly provides 
that in land-grants the king should state that he made the 
gift for securing merit to his parents and to himself 12 * The 
RajataranginI (I 143 ) « refers to the founding of vthnras 
(monasteries). 

Upaoasa ( fasting ). Fasting strictly means total abstin- 
ence from food and drink, but generally it means light diet 
restricted in quantity and also as regards the nature of the 
articles taken. Even the Tai S. (I 6. 7 3-4) refers 1 * 5 to three 
ways of observing vrata on the days of the Dai fapurpamasa-tsti 
either by subsisting only on food available in the village or on 
forest food or partaking of no food at all, Gaut 19 11 includes 
upavasa among the several means of removing sins Tapas is 
also one of such means ace. to him. But in Gaut. 19 15 as stat- 
ed above, Gaut includes fasting (atiSiaKa) among 'tapamsi'.

founder (of monasteries) constantly tells us that this sacrifice is made for the 
atonement of his own sins and those of his progenitors and kinsfolk" G. G. 
Coulton in 'Five centuries of Religion' (1936) vol III p. 27. Redemption 
of sin by monetary payments or by leaving property to the churches and 
monasteries was a very firm belief in the Middle Ages in Christian countries 
so much so that men who had earned properties made large gifts to the 
church when the prospect of death was near and vast estates accumulated 
in the hands of.chuicbmen, which led to the passing of the Statute of 
Mortmain in England,

Vf\ Upavasa (fasting) 53 

Haradatta explains upavasa 1 * 1 as giving up the eating of boiled 

rice (bhaktatyaga) and adds that upavasa is again included 

under tapathsi to stow the great importance attached to it. 

Haradatta notes that a predecessor of his relying on a Parana 

passage explained upavasa in Gaut. 19.11 as 'restraint of senses'. 

In many of the Grhya sutras upavasa means only eating light 

food prepared from corn usable in sacrifices (such as rice) once 

in the day excluding vegetables, masa (pulse), salt and flesh 

(compare Gobhila gr. I 5 26, Khadira gr IT 1.4 and 6, Kausika- 

sfltra I 31-32, Kathakagrhya 46.2 1 * 1 ). The Br. Up IV. 4. 22 

closely associates 'anasaka' (fasting) with tapas as a means to 

the mystic realisation of the Supreme Soul 129 . Jaimini (HI. 8. 9- 

11) appears to regard fasting as tapas 130 . Manu XI 203 ( = Visnu 

Dh. S. 54.29) provides that fasting (for a day) is the penance for 

omitting the rites ordained by the Veda (such as the 

Darsapurnamasa sacrifice and the performance of sandhya 

adoration) and for neglecting the special duties of a snStala 

(laid down in Manu IV 34 ff). When a parson was observing 

a fast he had to avoid doing certain other actions. A.cc to Devala 

a fast becomes bereft of its good results by drinking water often, 

by chewing tambidal by sleep in the day-time and by sexual 

intercourse^ ; but the GarudapurHna L 128. 6 and Bhavisya- 

purana (L 184 27) allow even when one is fasting the use of 

flowers, ornaments, rich clothes, garlands, unguents, applying 

collyrium to the eye and the cleansing of teeth. Daksa quoted 

oy the Par M states that if a man observes a fast for the day

north or south, or on the Visuva day (day of equinox), and on 
an eclipse of the sun or the moon and bathes he is freed from 
all sins 133 . Manu XL 166 (=Agnipurana 169.31) prescribas a 
fast for three days as a penance for theft of grass, firewood, tree, 
dry food (i e. grains of rice), jaggery, clothes, hide and flesh. 
The Anusasanaparva (106 1) remaiks 133 that men of all varnas 
and even Mlecchas thought highly of fasts and that chapter 
contains an exaggerated eulogy of fasting Almost all religions 
(except Zoroastrianism) such as the Hebrew, Christian (in Lent) 
and Moslem (in Ramjan) emphasize the necessity of fasting as 
a discipline or as a preparation for penitence The Bhavisya- 
purana (I, chap 16, 12-14) states that those who have not kind- 
led sacred fireB can please, the gods by vratas, restraints, gifts 
and particularly by upavasas and points out (verses 18-22) what 
substances (eatables) should be given up from the first to the 
15th hthi in each fortnight In the Satapatha Brahmana and the 
srauta and grhya sntaas the word upavasatha is used in the 
sense of 'upavasa' and is derived from 'vas' (to dwell) with 'upa'. 
Vide H of Dh. vol H p 1010 and n 2376 for the Sat Br. The 
Khadira gr 11 1 4, Gobhila gr I 6 2, Kausika-sutra I 31 employ 
the word upavasatha Ap Dh S.IT 1 1 4-5 prescribe an upavasa 
for husband and wife on par van days and if they cannot totally 
abstain from food they should eat only once by day food proper 
for upavasa Apararka p. 199, Smr G (sraddha p 355) and Krtya- 
ratnakara quote a veise from Vyasa deriving the word 
upavasa 13 ^. The Ap Dh S. II 5 9-13, Baud. Dh II 7 32, Vas 
6 21 and San gr. n 16 5 have the same verse viz. 'an ahitagni, 
a draught ox and brahmacarin, these three fulfill (their work) by 
eating, they cannot fulfill their duties by non-eating'. This is 
explained as not applying to prayasoittas (Baud. Dh S TL 7 34) 
and to fasts on Ekadasl. The Santiparva 323 17 states 'Just as 
a dirty garment is aftei wards cleansed by water, so to those who 
are heated in (the fire of) fasting inexhaustible happiness for 
a long time comes.' Santi 79 18, however, says 'merely emaciat- 
ing the body by fasting is not tapas, but ahimsa, truthfulness, 
freedom from cruelty, restraint and compassion are tapas\

IV ] Tirthiyalra ( Pilgrimages ) SS 

Tirlhayntrai-— Pilgrimage will be dealt with exhaus- 
tively in a later section, It was believed that going on a 
pilgrimage and bathing in such holy rivers as the Ganges freed 
. a man from sins. Visnu Dh. S. (35.6) lays down that those 
guilty of maJiapatalcas may become pure by Asvamedha sacrifice 
or by visiting all the sacred placas on the earth. Devala says 
that a man removes the consequences of such grave sins as the 
murder of a brahmana that he may have committed uninten- 
tionally by the performance of great sacrifices or by going on 
a pilgrimage. Parasara (XIL 58 ff) prescribes' 34 pilgrimage to 
see Eam&'s bridge to Lanka for a murderer of a brahmana who 
has studied the four Vedas. Devala statas: 'a man becomes 
freed from sin by approaching holy places and shrines, brahma- 
nas that practise austerities, that all rivers that fall into tho 
t)cean, all great mountains, all shrines and all forests are holy.' 
The Matsyapurana (184 18) says that a heap of sins as big as the 
mountain Meru or Mandara becomes destroyed when man 
reaches Avimukta (Benares), The Kuiuiapuraua 13 * (purvardha 
29.3) says 'I do not see any other expiation for destroying all 
sins in the Kaliyuga for all beings except Benares' Even 
in the times of the Peshwas of Poona pilgrimage was prescribed 
for brahmana murder (vide .'Selections from Peshwa Eecords' 
vol 43 p. 107) and the brahmaDas were ordered that after the 
sinner performed the penance they were to dine with him and 

T ZTfT^^ 5 ad J' 8m PUlified In an order dated sate

was born when their paternal grandmother lived with one

the Peshwa issued an order that they should go to Tnlapur on the 
banks of the Bhlma river and that they and their male progeny 
together with their wives should be restored back to the caste 
and complete association with them as to taking food and 
marriage be carried on with •them from generation to genera- 
tion, ,3S The Pr. PrakSsa quotes a verse from the Bhavisya- 
purana about the penance for brahmana murder to the effect 
that for him who dwells to the north of the Vindhya mountain 
Parasara prescribes the sight of Setubandha as a penance and 
then remarks that a man from the north of Vindhya has to 
travel 360 yojanas to reach Setubandha and that sinoe 360 
Prajapatya penances are declared to be enough to remove the 
sin of brahmahatya, it impliedly follows that each yojana 
towards a tirtha is equal to one Prajapatya. The Smrtyar- 
thasara ( pp. 149-150 ) quotes several verses from the Puranas 
stating that gods like Brahma, Visnu and Siva, great sages liko 
Bbrgu, Vasistha and VisvSmitra, great kings like Hariscandra, 
Bala, Sagara obtained greatness by means of tlrthas and that 
Pandavas, Sri Krsna, Narada, Vyasa and other sages engaged 
in pilgrimages for securing kingdoms and for removal of evil 
fortune. This subject of thtftas will be dealt with at length in 
a separate section.

CHAPTER III 

PRAYASCITTA; ITS ORI$I>~. DERIVATION 
AKD MEAXIKG 

It is now necessary to tarn to prayascittas as removers of 
sin. A number of subjects will I all to hs treated here. 

First, au attempt must bs made to understand the etymo- 
logy and meaning of the word 'prayascitta' in ancient times 
There are two forms of the word, prayascitti and prayascitta, 
which occur in Vedio works without distinction of meaning 
and hoth forms are fanly old, though ptByascith appears to be 
the older of the two The form prayascitti frequently occuis 
mtheTai.S (as in RIM H. 1 4.1, HL 1.3 2-3, V 1.9.3, V. 
312.1) 136 ". In some of these passages no question of sin arises. 
The woid means 'doing some thing which would gstjeidof some 
accidental happening or mishap such as the breaking of an ukhfi 
(a pot oi saucepan for boiling or cooking) or the sun's losing its 
brilliance.' In Tai S. V. 3.12.1 the word is used in the sense of 
an expiation for a sin. So even in very old books the word had 
two shadas of meaning. The Kausttaki 137 Br. (vi. 12) states : 
"they say 'whatever mistake or excess occurs in the sacrifice 
that affects the priest halima, that he treats with the three^ 
fold learning (i. e. the three Vedas)". The word also occurs in 
the Athaivaveda XIV. 1 30, Vaj. S. 39.12 (in close proximity to * 
niskrti), in the Ait. Br. V 27, in the Sat. Br. IV. 5. 7.1, VII. 
1.4 9, XL 5.3 8, XH. 4.1 6 and in other works also The form 
prayascitta occurs in Kausltaki Br. V. 9, VL 12 and elsewhere. 
The £sv. Sr. IH 10.38 and Sankhayana Sr. IH 19.1 respectively 
employ the words prayascitti and prayascitta 135 . In Par gr I.

10 the form 'prayascitti' is employed. Jai. in several plaoes 
employs the word prayascitta (as in VI 3 7, VI 4.10, VI 5.45 
and 49, XEL 3 16). Sahara" 9 on the last siitra (XII 3.16) ex- 
plains that the prayascittas (m the Sruti tacts) are of two kinds, 
viz some are meant to make good the defect in the procedure 
and materials of sacrifice which arises or befalls through some 
neglect or heedlessness, while others are subsidiary parts of a 
rite when an occasion arises i e they are undertaken to atone 
for not doing what is ordained or doing something which is 
forbidden (e g non-performance of daily Agnihotra even though 
the sun rises) The Sat. Br 1W XII 4 and Ait Br. 32 2-11 pro- 
vide some interesting and amusing examplef of the mishaps for 
which prayascittas are provided e. g when a vicious boar, ram 
or dog runs between the sacrifioal fires, or if Agnihotra milk 
gets spilled while the cow is being milked or if the milk pot is 
turned upside down or if it were to break or if the cow were to 
lie down while being milked, or if the fire were to go out after 
the first libation is offered etc Vide also Manava-grhya I 3, 
Hir. gr I 5 1-16, Bharadvaja gr H 32, Kausika-sutra 46. 14-55, 
Asv Sr HI 10 and Asr gr. BX 6-7 for similar occurrences and 
prayascittas The Mahabhasya on Pan. VI 1.157 explains 1 * 1 
both prayascitti and prayascitta on the analogy of the word 
Paraskaia Prayascittas may be said to be, in the language of 
the Mlmamsa, either hi atvarlha or purusSitha The former are 
prescribed in the Srautasutras. It is the latter kind of praya- 
scittas that are generally dealt with in Smrti works on praya-

IV] Derivation of Praya&titta 59 

works are passed over, as they have either been mentioned in 
vol. 2L or were of rare occurrence even in olden days. 

Most digests and commentaries derive the word prayascitta 
relying on a verse (attributed to Angiras 142 by some) from 
praya ( meaning 'tapas' ) and citta (meaning resolve or firm 
belief), the idea being that prayascittas are so called because 
of their association with or emergence from a resolve to under- 
go tapas or because of the firm belief that it will be a means of 
the removal of sin. Various other derivations are suggested by 
some writers. The Balambhattl 143 on Yaj. TJX 206 quotes a half 
verse to the effect that 'praya' means 'sin' and 'citta* means 
'purification', which had been quoted by Paksadhavamisra 14 *, 
Bhaktupadhyaya and the Todatananda, but the Pr. M. (p. 2) 
says that the source or authenticity of that vetse is doubtful. 
Hemadri refers to an unnamed bhasyakara's explanation viz. 
'praya* means 'destruction' and 'citta' means 'joining together' 
and prayascitta means the making good what is lost and that 
the word denotes a nattnttttka action on sin. 

The Par. M. quotes a smrti text 145 and says that that is 
prayascitta whereby the 'citta' (the mind) of a repentant sinner 
is made generally (pr&yasah) free (from emotion i. e brought 
to a normal state) by the parsad (assembly of learnedbrahmanas). 
Here 'prayah' seems to be taken as equal to 'prayasah' and 
'citta' has its usual sense. In Sayana's 116 comment on the

60 Histoiy of Dhai ma&astra [Vol. 

Satnavidhana Br T 5 1 another derivation is suggested via that 
'prayaiY is composed of two parts 'pra' and 'ayah' and means 
'happening or finding' (of the non-performance of what is 
Ordained) and 'citta' means 'knowledge' ; and so religious obser- 
vances after knowing a certain happening are called praya- 
scittas. The Pr Vi p 3 and Pr. Tattva p 467 quote Harlta and 
give 117 yet another derivation (from 'prayata* pure and 'cita' 
collected), in accordance with which 'prayascitta' means such 
actions as tapas, gifts and sacrifices whereby a man becomes 
purified (prayata) and destroys his accumulated sins ('cita' being 
equal to 'upacita'), just as clothes are made clean by the employ- 
ment of salts, moist heat, putting in boiling water on a fire, and 
washing in water Hence, as the Mit says, the word praya- 
scitta conventionally 148 denotes a certain act or rite of the 
nmrmthka type (since it takes place only when an occasion 
arises) intended for the destruction of sin (and therefore being

prsyascitta partakes of the nature of both naimittika and kainya 
actions. The Pr. Prakasa finds fault with the definitions of 
prayascitta proposed by the Kalpatara, Sulapani and others 
and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that those alone are 
prayascittas which are so spoken of by the learned, just as on 
Jaimini IL1.32 (tac-codakesu mantrakhya) Bhattacarya explains

Sins as stated by Brhaspati lsl and others are of two kinds, 
viz. intentionally committed and unintentionally committed. 

Great divergence of views has prevailed from very ancient 
times as to whether prayascittas can destroy sins intentionally 
committed Manu 3X 45 and Yaj. III. 226 are positive that 
sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by prayascittas or 
by the study of the Veda The difficulty arises about sins com- 
mitted intentionally or with full knowledge. Gaut. (19. 3-6 
= Vas. 22. 2-5) states two views, lsl » one holding that praya- 
scitta should not be performed since deeds (here shiful deeds ) 
are not destroyed (except by experiencing the consequences 
thereof), the other view holding that prayascitta should be per-

upon certain indications in Vedic passages. Gaut. relies upon 
four such passages. The first says" 152 'after performing the 
punahstoma™ 3 one can come back to (become fit for) soma sacri- 
fice (i. e. for Vedic rites in general). Another indication is • 
' after performing Vratyastoma (one becomes fit for Vedic sacri- 
fices).* A third is: "He, who offers the Asvamedha sacrifice, 
crosses beyond all sin, beyond brahmana murder '. The fourth 
is* one should make a person charged with grave sins per- 
form the Agnistut Vasistha also (20 1-2) gives expression 
to the two views about the efficacy of penances. 15 * ManuSI. 
45 (latter half) states, that according to some, prayascittas may 
be prescribed for the removal of intentionally committed sins 
from indications contained in the Vedas. It cannot be said that 
these Sruti passages are mere at tlmvadas (i. e laudatory texts). 
They must really be taken, though expressed in the form of 
ordinary arthavadas, as laying down (a vidh) that one desirous 
of destroying his sins should perform Asvamedha and the other 
sacrifices mentioned In this case the maxim of ratnsattra iiS 
applies (vide Jai. IV. 3. 17-19). There are certain satlras

dasaratra, Caturdasaratra and so on. All these are called ratri- 
sattras. With reference to these a Vedic passage says 'those 
who approach (i. e. perform) thesB ratrisattras attain stability 
(long life or super-9tninence) '. In the text prescribing the ratri- 
sattras theTe is no mention of any special reward for perfor- 
mance. Therefore 'stability' (prattsthS) contained in tbe 
passage must be held to be the reward of the performance ot 
ratrisattras and not mere heaven (which is the reward of all 
sacrifices for which no special reward is mentioned, according 
tojai. IV. 3. 15-16). The same maxim applies to passages 
likeYaj IE. 226 which say that sin is removed by penances 156 . 
Medhatithi draws attention to the story in the Tai. S. VI. 2.7 5, 
Kathaka S. VUL 5, Ait Br 35.2 that Indra consigned yatis to 
SMabrkas (dogs or wolves) and had to perform the rites called 
Upahavya to get rid of the sin. M anu states his own opinion in 
the next verse (XI. 46) that sins committed unintentionally 
are destroyed by the recitation of Vedic texts and sins 
committed intentionally through folly are destroyed by 
various prayascittas. Yaj. HI. 226 (latter half) appears 
to hold that prayascittas do not destroy sins intentionally 
committed, but the sinner undergoing the prescribed penance 
becomes fit to be associated with other people on account of the 
texts (laying down the prayascittas); but Ysj. implies, it seems, 
that the results of sin intentionally committed (such as Hell and 
the like ) are not got rid of. Manu XI. 189 prohibiting social in- 
tercourse with sinners who have not performed penance practi- 
cally conveys the same idea as that of Yaj in UT, 226 ( latter 
half). Y«j. m. 220 observes that a man guilty of patalias should 
perform prayasoitta for his own purification (here and in the 
next world ) ; in this way (i. e if he performs penance) his inner 
soul recovers its composure and the people also become satisfied

from the consequences of sins committed unintentionally, but no 
penance exists which frees a man from the consequences of sins 
knowingly committed except in the case of upapatakas and in

cites a verse of Jabili and verses of Devala setting forth the two 
views about the efficacy of prayascittas, -while it also cites the 
view of Baudhayana-smrti that there is no prayascitta for sins 
committed knowingly and the view of Angiras that the panance 
it> double in the latter case' Ss . Angiras further says that 
prayascitsas do destroy the sin arising from committing acts 
that axe forbidden and the like, just as the rising sun removes dark- 
ness Manu XI. 47 providss- *A twice-born man having become 
liable to perform a penance (for a sin), whether he committed it 
through fate or by some act committed in a former existence, 
must not have intercourse with virtuous men until he performs 
the proper penance.* Ap. Dh. S (I. 9 34 34-35) provides 'If a 
man slays a guru ( father, Vedie teacher &c ) or a brahmasa 
■who has studied the Yeda and finished the ceremonies of a soma

It appears to follow from Apastamba's words that penance 
ending in death destroys the sin. The same was the view of 
Arigiras, Yama and others.

£V] Twofold Consequences of sin 65 

In this conflict among toe authors of smrtis the solution 
proposed by the Mit. on Yaj d 226 has been accepted by most 
medieval writers and is as follows 160 . The potentialities and 
consequences of sins are twofold, viz those leading to Hell and 
the others preventing intercourse with members of the society 
to which the sinner belongs Therefore, even though a praya- 
scitta may not be efficacious to prevent the first mentioned 
consequence (viz fall into Hell), there is nothing improper in 
prayascitta being effective in removing the obstacle to associa- 
tion with other people. As to sinful acts that are not patanuia 
(do not cause loss of caste) prayascitta does destroy such sin- 
fulness as expressly stated by Manu. XL 46. Even as to sins 
that are pataniya and are committed intentionally, if a penance 
ending in death is undergone as laid down by Manu XL 73, 
Yaj HI 247-248 and Gaut 22. 2-3 for brahmana murder; Manu 
XL 90-91, Yai HL 253, Gaut 23 1 for drinking sura; Gaut 23 8- 
11, Manu XI 103-104 and Yaj. HL 259 for sexual intercourse 
with the guru's wife; Manu XL 99-100 and Yaj. HL 257 for theft 
of brahmana's gold; then the sin is destroyed as stated by 5p. 
Da S 1 9 24 25 and I 10. 28.18 quoted above When Manu says 
(inXL 89 latter half) that there is no penance for the sin of slaying 
a brahmana intentionally, the proper interpretation of this read 
along with Manu XL 46 quoted above is not that there is total 
absence of prayascitta in such a case, but that ordinary praya- 
'scittas (such as those in Manu XL 72) would not do in such a 
case, but only very heavy ones that would end in death. Medi- 
eval digests like the Prayascitta-muktavali (folio 32a) hold that 
-according to the Kalivmjya section penance ending in death is 
forbidden in the case of brahmana sinners and therefore a

brahmana murderer can only be made to undergo the twelve 
years* penance. 

The Par M. (TI part 1 pp 201-303) sets out this view of 
the Mit and appears to bold it itself. It sets out another view 
also. Those who hold this latter view read Yaj. III. 226 as 
'kamatosvyavaharyastu' with an auagi aha. The meaning then 
is that one who has performed the penance prescribed for a sin 
does not fall into Hell, but be cannot be allowed to associate 
with good men ( sistas ) if he is guilty of a wilful sin. 
There is a verse of Manu (XI 190 = Visnu Dh. S. 54.32 ) 
that one should not associate with those who slay children, who 
return evil for the good done to them, who slay those that come 
for protection and who kill women, even though they might 
have become purified by undergoing the appropriate penance. 
There is a similar verse of Y&j III 298 on which the comment 
of Vijnanesvara is most interesting as indicative of the spirit 
of our medieval writers who were always oppressed by the 
might of words (Vedic or snirti) deemed as authoritative. The 
Mit remarks ux 'the prohibition (contained in Yaj. TS, 298) is 
based on the text alone (and not on logic or reasoning). What 
cannot a text do? There is nothing too heavy for a text. 
Therefore, even though a light penance is prescribed for slaying 
an adulterous woman, still there is a prohibition against 
associating with such slayers based on the words of the text',

paternal ancestors, ten descendants and himself ) Visvarupa says that this

iVj The PoiOer of Authoritative Texts 67 

This maxim is taken from the bhasya of Sabara and is a 
favourite device with all Dharmasastra writers from VisvarQpa 
downwards to justify any statement of the smrtis however 
illogical or exaggerated it might appear to be. The Pr. T. 
(pp. 544-545) quotes 162 the Mit. about the two iaktis of sin and 
its remarks on Yaj HI. 298 and does not approve of them, 
relying on the words of Brhaspati that no decision should be 
arrived at on the bare words of the sastra, but it should also be 
supported by reasoning and that the words 'slayers of women' 
do not refer to adulterous women but to innocent women 
(such as the wives of one's enemies). Narada (sahasa, 
verse 11) holds that those who are punished by the king with a 
fine of the first or second (madhyama) kind can be allowed to 
associate with other members of society but those who are 
awarded the highest fine should not be spoken to by others K2a . 
Those who take the view of the sinner's inability to associate 
with other men even after undergoing penance rely also upon 
Vedanta-sutra IH. 4. 43 (bahis-tubhayathapi smrteracaracca ). 
The Par. M. very rightly points lft » out that the sutra 
refers to those who after going in for life-long celibacy 
abandon the duties of that stage of life (asrama) and 
feat it does not refer to householders and quotes a verse of 
Kausika in support. The Smrti-muktaphala (Pr., pp. 867-868) 
refers to this discussion contained m the Par. M. The Pr. M 
(P. 7) appears"* to hold that the great Sankaracarya explained

. vyavaharyastu' and that those who fell from the vow of life-long 

celibacy (either as naisthika brahmacarins or as sannyasms) 
.were to be excommunicated (and not to be associated with) 

The printed editions- of the bhasya contain no express quotation 
,of Yajnavalkya's verse, but from the fact of his quoting Atari's 

verse it is possible to hold that Sankaracarya understood 

Y&jnavalkya as the Pr. M. says he did. 

A. question may naturally be asked: why should it be 
accepted that penances destroy sin (as stated in Yaj HI 226). 
The answer is : what 16s actions are grave sins or minor sina or 
nob sins at all is laid down by the sastra (sruti and smrtis) 
For example, it is not clear to ordinary people why being an 
officer over mines or making friends of low people or being a 
'servant of a sudra should be a sin at all Buf the smrtis say 
so. If the smrtis are to be relied upon for determining what 
acts are sinful, then it follows as a matter of course that the 
'same smrtis which speak of penances as removers of sins must 
also be accepted and that no other means for determining the 
efficacy of penances can be appealed to So also the Bhagavad- 
glta (IV 37) states that the fire of spiritual knowledge consumes 
all (accumulated, saneita) actions (and their consequences). 

Many of the sins (though not all) for which penances are 
provided in the smrtis are also offences punishable by the king 
or State For example, murder, theft, incest, perjury are acts 
punishable by the State in almost all countries even now and 
were so m ancient and medieval India Persons guilty of these 
Were also liable to undergo prayascittas. It is probably due to 
this double liability that punishments for crimes in anoient and 
medieval India were light as compared with the heavy punish- 
ments for even trifling crimes inflicted in western countries 
only a century or two ago But there are other acts which are not 
punishable by the State now and were not probably punished 
even in ancient or medieval India by the king. For example, 
forgetting Veda studied by a person, not tending Vedic tores 
consecrated by a person himself, sleeping till after sun-rise 
and sleeping at sunset are palalcas, ace toVas I 19 and s 
of those are upapatakas ace to Y S 3 IK 239. It does^ j*^

likely that an Indian king ever punished any parson for 
these On the other hand, obstructing the road prying when 
the king is taking his meals, sitting before the king on ones 
haunches, speaking loudly before the king are among the fifty 
chalas of which the king could take cognisance suo wotu and 
award suitable punishment (vide H. of Dh vol III P. 266). But 
there is nothing to show that such actions ever fell within the 
purview of the rules about prayascittas. The important questions 
are: What was the relation of the rules about prayascittas 
which were to be prescribed by a parisad ( a meeting of learned 
brShmanas) to punishments by the king as regards actions 
which were both palates inviting penances and crimes entailing 
punishments by the King? Which of these two sets of rules 
was earlier? Were penance and punishment cumulative or 
alternative? It is difficult to give definite opinions on these 
questions. We know that prayascittas like Asvamedha are 
spoken of even in the Tai S. We also know that the pra&navioaha 
(which is quite close to pradvivaka in derivation and meaning ) 
occurs in the Vaj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai Br. EL 5. 6. Therefore it 
follows that judicial functions were very early separated from 
the executive functions of the king. The reference to the ordeal 
of fire in the Tandya Br 14. 6. 6 (vide H. of Dh. vol. ,IH p. 361 ) 
and the grasping of a red-hot hatchet in the hand by a person 
accused of theft and his being killed show that ordeals were 
administered and the punishment for theft was death. 
Brhaspati, quoted in the Vivadaratnakara, says 'When a man 
of good character and a diligent reader of the Veda has com- 
mitted theft he shall bs kept in prison for a long time and shall 
ba caused to perform penance after having been compelled to 
restore the goods* (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 362 16 «). 

The parisad made its own rules about prayascittas and the 
king awarded punishments. Which set of rules was earlier it iB 
difficult to say. The king did not very probably interfere with 
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the parisad and the brahmanas 
helped the king in the administration of justice by being judges 
and by advising him as to the punishments to be imposed (-vide

^erse means that a learned brabmana who has been well conducted but I ell 
a victim to the temptation of theft should not be jailed for a long tim e 
because jail life torments his mind and therefore he should be made to 
restate stolen property and given penance. 



?& Iftstory of Mai ma&aslra [Vb] ( 

VisnuDh. S.V. 194). Gautama VBLl, echoing the words of 
the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4 5, observes: *« 'the king and the brahmana 
with profound learning uphold the moral order in the world (or 
are upholders of the sacred law). The Ap. Dh. S. (II 5. 10. 12-16) 
contains very important information: 'The Scarya shall order 
those who, while participating according to the sastras (in the 
privileges and responsibilities of their castes), have gone astray 
through the weakness of their senses to perform penances accord- 
ing to the dictates (of the smrtis) commensurate with their 
(sinful) acts. If they transgress their acarya's order he shall 
take them to the king. The king shall send them to his purohta 
proficient in dharmasastra and the science of government, 
He (purohita) shall order them to perform (proper penances) 
if they are brahmanas. He shall reduce them by forcible 
means except corporal punishment and slavery.' So this 
passage shows that the king helped in carrying out prSyas- 
cittas. Narada includes 'neglect of penances* among matters 
solely dependent on the king (prakJrnaka, verse 3) and 
not on complaints by private individuals. Devala ,6S probably 
conveys the real position when he says: 'The king is the 
giver of krcchras (i. e his consent is required for actually 
undergoing the prescribed penances), the learned man 
who has studied Dharmasastras prescribes the prayascitta, 
the sinner carries out the penance and the king's officer sees 
to the safe performance of the prescribed penance * Parasara 
VUL 28 says 'an assembly should point out the proper penance 
after getting the permission of the king, it should not be done 
without reference to him, but slight penance may he done with- 
out informing him'. The Par. M. H part 1. p. 232 explains 
that this applies to prayascittas for sins like govadha or those 
that are greater than it. Devala 169 also has similar verses.

IV] Motion of the Parisad and the King 71 

Pata^ara VTJI, 29 states that the king also should not ignore 
the parisad and Bhould not by himself prescribe penance. 
Paithmasi quoted by the Dandaviveka (p. 76) provides 170 for 
both prayascitta and punishment and from the tenor of the verse 
it appears that both were to be enforced by the king. The posi- 
tion is tolerably clear as to medievel times One feels great 
hesitation in stating definitely the relation of punishment to 
penances and the king's position as to both in ancient times. 
5p. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 1-4 provide 171 that one who kills a ksatriya 
or a vaisya or a sudra shall respectively give one thousand 
cows, a hundred cows and ten cows for the purpose of removing 
the enmity and that in each of these cases one bull was to be 
given in addition for the purpose of expiation. Spastamba 
does not expressly state to whom the cows were to be given. 
The commentator Haradatta explains that they were to be given 
to brahmanas. Manu XI. 127, 129, 130, and Yaj m. 266-267 
have similar provisions but in the chapter on penances On 
the other hand, Baud. Dh. S. I. 10 23. expressly states that the 
cows are to be given to the king. As both the words 'vaira- 
niryatanSitham' and 'prayascitterthah' are employed by JLp 
it may be said that the cows were to be made over to the king 
even according to Apastamba. The cows were to be made over 
to the king for bestowal on the family of the murdered person to 
mollify them and if they refused to receive them the king was 
ot to retain them for himself but was to distribute them 
among brahmanas. We know that Manu (IX. 243-245) provides 

no a A^fTTT d from a man *** 0f morta l «*»*« 

notto be taken for himself by the king but was to be offered

( = Matsya 227 164) "and Visnu V. 4-7 say that on the forehead 
a mark of female private parts with red-hot iron should La 
branded in the case of incest, the mark of a tavern flag in the 
case of drinking sard., the mark of dog's foot in the case of theft 
(of brahmana's gold) and the mark of a headless ^nrak in the 
case of a brahmaDa-murder. Manu IX. 340 further prescri- 
bes that men of all castes guilty of the four mahapatakas com- 
mitted unintentionally that perform the proper penance should 
not be branded on the forehead by the king but should be 
awarded the highest fine Manu IX. 241 and 242 provide that a 
brahmana guilty of these grave sins unintentionally may he 
punished with the middle amercement (if he himself be possessed 
of good qualities) but if he was guilty of the grave sins committed 
intentionally he should be banished from the kingdom being 
allowed to take with him his wealth and paraphernalia; 
while persons other than brShmanas when guilty of grave 
sins unintentionally com'iiitted were to be deprived of all their 
wealth and if guilty intentionally they were to be sentenced 
to death. These verseB show that' though prayascitta be per- 
formed persons guilty of grave sins were liable to undergo 
punishment and if no penance was performed then they were 
liable to branding and also fines etc Manu XL 56 provides 
that bearing false witness is similar to the drinking of smU 
and Manu XL 57 and Yaj. HI. 230 hold that misappropria- 
tion of a deposit is like the theft of gold Visnu Dh. S 
(V 169 ) provides that the misappropriator of a deposit 
was to be made to return the deposit or its price with interest 
and was to be punished like a thief by the king and V 179 
that a false witness had all his property confiscated. Theso 
instances establish that both fines by the king (i. e lSja-danda ) 
and penances prescribed by the assembly of learned men ( l. e 
parisaddanda or daiva danda) had to be undeigone by those guilty 
of some grave sins that were also looked upon as crimes In soma 
cases the penance and the punishment were the same For 
example, Gaut 23 10-11, Vas. 20. 13, Manu XI 104, Yaj. HI 
259 and several other smrtikaras prescribe for incest the 
penance of the excision of the testicles and penis and proceeding 
toward the south or south-west till the body falls Naradaas 
quoted above prescribes for incest the punishment (<?ait<$a) of the 
excision of the testicles The Mit. on Yaj. EI. 233 /If 01 ?. 8 
Narada and remarks that the punishment of excision and death 
prescribed by Yaj HI 233 applies only to non-brahmapas and 
that in such cases the punishment of death itself is we

prayascitta There were works like the Madanaparijata 172 (p. 827) 
and the Mitaksara that held that the prohibition against corporal 
harm to brahtnanas (ManuVHI 380) applies only to matters 
other than prSyascittas and that since the Manusrurti itself 
(XL 100 ) states that a brahmana guilty of theft of brahmana's 
gold may go to the king with an iron club and hare his head 
smashed by the king, the death of a brahmana as a penance for 
theft by being struck with a club presented by himself was not 
ruled out. In some cases punishment by the king was deemed 
to have purged a man of sin and no penance seems to have been 
thought necessary, as Manu Vm 318 (=Vas 19.45) says 'men 
that commit sins and are punished by the king become purified 
and reach heaven like good men who perform meritorious deeds.' 
IheMit on Taj. m. 259 explains that this holds good only 
where the punishment is death, as in the case of incest noted 
above. Ap. Dh. S. II. 1027. 15-16 provide ™ that a person 
guilty of slaying a man, of theft and of forcible seizure of land 
was to be deprived of his wealth by the king and was to be 
sentenced to death and that if the offender was a brahmana he

or if hs is not killed but is allowed to go half dead and 
lives, the thiaf is freed from the guilt. The Mit. on Ysj. 
IH 257 quotes a prose passage from Sankha and a verse from 
Samvarta (122) to the same effect Manu in the chapter on 
penances (XL 100-101 = Agnipursna 169. 20-21) provides the 
same procedure for theft »9 a penance. Vas 20. 41, Yaj. WL 
259, Visnu 52. 1-2 and Parfisara XDL 69-70 provide a somewhat 
similar penance for the thief of brahmana's gold. Vasistha 
introduces an important change viz , that the king hands over 
to the thief a weapon made of udumbara wood (or probably of 
copper ) with which the thief is to kill himself. It appears that 
gradually the king gave up this unpleasant method of award- 
ing punishment personally Narada m (parisista, verses 46-47) 
provides that after the thief comes running to the king and 
announces his guilt, the king was to touch him (with the club, 
as a symbolic gesture) and then let him off and the thief be- 
came freed from Bin by his confession of guilt. It has to be 
remembered, however, that the thief had to restore, even when he 
underwent penance, stolen property, as stated by Manu YHL 40, 
Yaj. 11 36 and 270, Brhaspati and by digests 176 like the Pr. 
Prakarana If it were impossible to make the thief restore the 
stolen property the king had to make it good from his own 
treasury" 7 (Gaut X 47, Santiparva 75. 10, Kautilya EL 16) 
or he had to make his officers 1TB entrusted with the duty of 
preventing thefts pay the price of the stolen property ( £p Eh. 
S. IT. 10. 26. 8). Vide for further details H. of Dh vol EI 
pp. 168-168. It appears that the actual carrying out of the 
sentence of death was later "on assigned, to CSndSlas aB stated 
by Manu X. 56 and Visnu Dh, S, 16. 11 (vadhya-ghatitvam 
cSndalanSm ).

jyj Circumstances to be considered 75 

Another point to be noted is that as regards the awarding 
of punishments and prescribing of penances, the matters to be 
considered were the same viz. whether the lapse was inten- 
tional 17 * (kamatah) or unintentional (alamatah) or whether it 
was the first offence or whether it was repeated and what the 
circumstances as to the time, the place, the caste, the age, the 
capacity, learning, wealth were. Compare Kautilya IV. 10, 
Gaut. X1L 48, Manu TIL 16 and YBX 126, Yaj 1 368, Visnu V. 
194, Yas. 19. 9 about punishments with Baud. 160 Dh. S. 1. 1. 16, 
Taj' EL 293 ( = AM verse 248 and Agniptirana 173. 6), Angiras 
^Yisvamitea, Yrddha-HarltaLK. 297, and Vyaghra as regards 
penances It is on account of this close connection between 
punishments and penances that the Prayascittatattva, after 
quoting Devala to the effect that if a man makes no move for 
taking prayascitta for one year, he has to undergo double 
penance thereafter .and to pay a double fine to the king, re- 
marks that the maxim is that prayasoittas are to be moulded on 
the lines of punishments tsl . The Pr. M. (pp. 124-135) quotes 
Kasyapa who provides a penance for one that causes mischief 
to a well, public park, bridge, rampart wall or a temple or idol, 
then quotes Yisnu Y. 169 which prescribes the highest fine for 
a breaker of idols, Manu IX 285 which provides a fine of 500

IV] Vast Ltietature mi prai/atciftas 77 

The literature on prayascittas is vast in extent, since in 
ancient times they loomed very large in the popular mind. Out 
of tho 28 chapters of the Gautamadhaima-sntta, ten ( i. e. more 
than one-third of the whole ) are devoted to penances. Out of 
the 30 chapters of the printed Vasistha-dharmasutra, prayascittas 
cover nine (20-28) Manu devotes verses 44 to 265 (in all 222) 
of chapter eleven to penances and the Yajnavalkyasmrti con- 
taining 1009 verses deals with prayaseittab in 122 verses 
(HI. 205-327). Several printed smrtis such as those oi 
Angiras( 168 verses), Atri ( chapters 1-8 ), Devala(90 verses), 
Brhad-Yama (182 verses), Satatapasmrti (in 274 verses) from 
the Anandasrama collection of smrtis alone deal only with praya- 
scittas. Many other smrtis and several puranas.such as the Agni 
(chap 168-174), Garuda 52, Kurma (IJttarardha 30-34), Varaha 
131-136, Brahmanda (Tfpasamharapada chap. 9), Visrmdharm- 
ottaia (II 73, HI 234-237) contain hundreds of verses on" 
prayascittas. Besides commentaries like the Mitaksara, 
Apararka, Par. M. and others and digests like Madanaparijata 
(pp. 691-994), there are special digests dealing with prayascittas 
alone such as Hemadri on Prayascitta (which is of doubtful 
authenticity), the Prayascittaprakarana of Bhavadeva, Praya- 
scittaviveka, Prayascittatattva, Smrtimuktaphala (prayascitta 
section), Prayascittasara (part of Nrsimhaprasada), PrSya- 
scittamayukha, Prayascittaprakasa (ms. in the Anup 
Sanskrit library, Bikaner, No. 2610), Prayascittendusekbara of 
Nagejibhatta, which have been utilised in this work. The most 
elaborate treatment is found in Prayascittaviveka, Par. M.E 
parts 1 and 2, and Prayascittaprakasa, 

The commentators discuss the question about the 
persons who have adhiMra (capacity) for having penances 

and YS e m° r 9 i Jr B ? we + MaTO ^ 44 fcrsyascittlyate narah) 
and Yaj M. 219 (narah patanam-rcchati) both employ the word 
man without « any qualification, the commentators and 
d gests say that penances are meant for men of all varnas for 
£1 persons born of unions in the reverse order (pratilomajas) and 
foreven candalas. Yaj. m. 262 states that a sudra JnTr 






78 Hislovj of Dharmaiastra [Vol. 

though ho has no adhikara (for recitation of Vedic mantras and 
Jioma), yet becomes purified by undergoing the observances 
(except japa and homa) for the periods prescribed, Angiras «s 
provides that penance may be administered to a audra devoid 
of japa and homa. Even as to japa and homa there were works 
like the Madanaparijata p. 749 and Vy. M (p. Hi) that relying 
on a verse of Parasara VI, 63-64 held that a homa could be 
performed for women and sudras in the ordinary fire through a 
brahmana 186 . The Pr. V. relies on Manu X. 62 and a prose 
passage of Devala for the proposition that even Oandalas have 
to perform penances, if they act contrary to the rules and pro- 
hibitions laid down for them Since the non-performancB of 
what is prescribed and doing what is forbidden lead to sin, 
the person guilty of these or the person who has a desire to 
destroy his sins is a person entitled to perform prSyascitta, as 
also one who repents of his guilt. 

Before going into the subject of the several prSyascittas 
prescribed for each grave or minor sin, some questions of a 
general character have to be disposed of. 

Some smrfcis like Brhad-y&tna HI 1-2 and Sankha state 
that a boy over five years of age and less than eleven years old, 
if guilty of some pstakas such as drinking stwS, has not to 
undergo penance personally, but his brother, father or other

16 years of ago, women and diseased parsons should be liable only- 
to half the prayascitta (prescribed for able-bodied men) The 
Mit on Yaj III 243 quotes a verse of Sumantu that for a male 
below twelve and above eighty years of age the penance is half 
(of that for ordinary men ) and one fourth for women within the 
same limits and a verso of Visnu that for women, old men and 
diseased persons half the penance should be prescribed and for 
boys ( before xipanayana ) only one-fourth. Some say that for 
boys less than five the penance is one-fourth Oyavana (prose) 
prescribes half prayascitta for boys, old men and women and 
declares that a person is a bala up to 16 years and a man is to 
bo regarded as similar to a btila after 70. Katyayana provided 
generally that the fines to be levied from females were to be half 
of those leviable from mole offenders as regards all offences 
and when the punishment for a male would be death, a woman 
criminal was to be punished with the cutting of a limb (nose, 
ears &c ) w 

The difference between a sin committed unintentionally 
(akamatah) and the same sin committed with full knowledge 
(kSmatah) is this that for the latter the prayascitta isdoublB 
of what is prescribed for the former as provided byAngiras, 1 ' 1 
Vyasa and the Agnipurana. As Yaj. in. 226 employs the word 
'ajiiSna' in the first half and the word 'kamatah' as its opposite 
in the second half instead of the word 'jnanatah' it follows that 
Yaj. makes no difference between the consequences of jtlana 
(knowledge) and lamina (desire). 

The caste of the offender as well as of the victim made a 
difference in the prayascitta as well as in the legal punishment. 
Vide H. of Dh vol. HI pp. 395-399 as to punishments for crimes 
dependent on caste. Visnu 192 provides that the prayascitta for

a ksatriya, vaisya and sudra sinner should be respectively J, 
| and i of what is prescribed for a brahmana sinner. The Agni- 
purana says 193 the same thing. The Par. M H. 1. p. 231 quotes 
the Oaturvimsatimata 19 * to the same effect. The Mit. on Yaj, 
IE. 250 explains that the verse of Oaturvimsatimata applies to 
all cases except where any one of the four saliasas is committed 
by a man of a lower caste as against one of a higher caste. 
Brhad-Yama (IV. 13-14) in prescribing penance for the kill- 
ing of a cow provides the same scale of 4, 3, 2, 1 for the four 
varnas Angiras (verse 3) prescribes the penances of Krcchra 
and Candrayana for a brahmana partaking of the food of 
an antyaja, half of these for a ksatriya or vaisya guilty of 
the same. Ya] It 206-207 provide that the punishments 
for defamation depend upon the higher or lower vara a or 
caste of the offender as well as of the person defamed and 
that if a ksatriya or vaisya defames a brahmana the fines 
aTe respectively twice or thrice as high as the fine for a 
brahmana defaming a brahmana and conversely if a brahmana 
defames a ksatriya or a vaisya the fine is reduced by half 
in each successive caste. The Mit quoting Angiras says 
that the rules about punishments apply to prayascittas for 
slaying a person i e. if a brahmana slays anybody and a 
certain penance is prescribed for him, then a ksatriya killing 
the person would have to perform double the penance prescribed 
for the brahmana and a vaisya offender three times as much 19S 
It may be pointed out here that though the smrtis provided for 
different punishments according to the castes of the offender and 
ot the person wronged and though some commentaries and 
digests went into all those details for the sake of presenting a

complete statement or digest of the smrti material, such 
discriminatory punishments had mostly ceased to be enforced 
by the rulers from about the 13th century A. D. at least, as 
stated by the Smrticandrika, the Madanaratna (vyavahara)and 
the Sarasvatlvilasa. Vide H. of Dh, vol. HI p 512 note 924 for 
the relevant quotations from the three works. Since, as stated 
above (n. 181), prayascittas were to be moulded on the lines of 
legal penalties, it appears that the discriminatory treatment 
about prayascittas depending upon the varna of the sinner must 
also have gradually fallen into disuetude with the disappear- 
ance of the more severe prayascittas and the substitution of 
cowb and monetary equivalents in later digests. And soma 
digests expressly state this to have been the case in relation to 
prayascittas. For example, the Pr Prakarana, after quoting 
Gaut. 22. 14-16 about the prayasratta for killing a ksatnya or 
vaisya or sudra under certain circumstances, remarks that in 
its day those prayascittas were no longer part of the practices 
of the people. 196 

Whether an act made a man liable to undergo prSyas- 
oitta depended in some cases on the country also, For 
example, marrying a maternal uncle's daughter was and is 
allowed in certain countries and among certain castes m 
the Deccan and Southern India on the ground of custom, but 
such a practice was severely condemned by Manu XL 171-172 
and Baud Dh S. I 1 17-24 and other smrfcis. Brhaspati refers 
to this custom as prevalent among southerners and states that 
in these countries persons following it are not liable to undergo 
prayascitta or penalty (at the hand of the king). Vide H. of 
Dh. vol. IT. p. 462 for Brhaspati's verses. 

Severity and extent of prayascitta depended also on the 
question whether a sinner had repeated the lapse or was a first 
offender. The £p Dh S (IT. 10. 27. 11-13) prescribes that a 
brahmana who has once committed adultery with a married 
woman of equal class shall perform one-fourth of the ne ° aD " e 
presciibed for a sudra having intercourse with a woman of the 
three upper castes, that for every repetition (of the crime) one 



1V , Fitst and confirmed offenders 83 

fourth of the Prance must be added and if (he commits 
aSry) for tbe fourth time, the whole penance (of IS years 
£ be performed-). The Mit on Y«. ffl. 293 remarks that 
Z a sin that is committed knowingly the prayascitta is double 
o? what is prescribed for the same em if committed unintention- 
ally and that if a sin is committed intentionally and is repeated 
then for the repeated lapse prayascitta is four times as much as 
that for the same deed done unintentionally Similarly, the 
asrama to which the sinner belonged made a difference in the 
prayascitta as stated by Angiras 'when persons in other gsramas 
are guilty of sins for which penance is prescribed if committed 
by householders, then the prayascitta is increased in the same 
proportion that is laid down for saaoa (bodily purity" 8 ). Manu 
V. m.Vas.YI.lS.'VisnuDh.S 60 26,Sankhal6. 23-24 pro- 
vide that "Vedic students, forest hermits and samyasins have 
respectively to perform twice, thrice and four times as much. 
iaitca as is prescribed for householders (e. g. by Manu V. 136 
<=Yisnu 60. 25). 

One convenient and merciful rule laid down by the smrtis 
was that if a man died in the midst of the period for which" 
penance had to be performed (sometimes it extended to twelve 
years or more) he became free from the sin here and in the next 
world as stated by Harlta, Vyasa and Yama 199 . 

Though the smrtis have entered into very great details 
about the pr&yascittas for different individual lapses, still they 
cannot be supposed to have dealt with every lapse. Therefore,

Gaut. (19. 18-20) provides that these acts (viz Vedic recitation, 
tapas, fasting, gifts &c ) may he optionally performed, when no 
(particular penance) has been prescribed, that for grave sins 
difficult penances and for trivial faults easy ones may be pres- 
cribed and that Krcchra, Atikrcchra and Candrayana are pen- 
ances for all sins ao Manu XJ 309 (=Visnu 54 34) provides that 
for the expiation of offences for which no particular atonement 
has been prescribed, let (the parisad) prescribe a penance after 
considering the (offender's) strength and the nature of the offence. 
Parasara (XI. 55-56) provides that the recitation of the Gsyatrl 
ten thousand times is the best penance for all sins and that 
Candrayana, YaVaka, Tulapurusa and serving cows destroy all 
sins Yaj. HI 265 provides that a man is purified from all sins 
by undergoing the penance for cow-kiUing or by Candrayana, 
observance for a month of the milt vrata or by Parata. Manu 
XL 117 provides for all upapaiakas except the sin of sexual 
intercourse by one who is in the stage of Yedic student the 
penance prescribed for govadha or candrayana. 

One guilty of a sin, even though he may himself be a 
learned man, should approach an assembly of learned brahmanas 
and after making some present ( a cow or the like ) announcing 
the nature of his lapse seek their decision about the proper 
penance for his lapse (Y5]. ** HT 300 and Parasara YJD0. 2)

his garment on, and with the garment still wet approach the 
assembly and should prostrate himself on the ground Thus the 
elders of the assembly ask the man prostrating himself before 
them 'what is your business, what is the trouble and what do 
you seek from us'. The assembly then asks him to go aside a 
little and debate among themselves what the pansnos should be, 
considering all the circumstances of time, place, nature of the 
lapse age &c Then one of them at the desire of the assembly 
should declare the assembly's decision as to the proper penance 
after citing the smrti passages and reducing the penance 
in view of the weakness and other circumstances of the offender. 
It has already been stated that the pansad acted under the 
direction of the king in matters of prayascitta and that the 
king was not to interfere with the decision of the assembly. 
The principal stages in a penance were four viz. approaching tho 
parisad, the declaration of the appropriate penance by the 
parisad, the actual performance of the penance declared and 
the announcing of the sinner's freedom from taint (Angiras q. 
by Fr. Praktsa folio 37a 'upasthanam vratadesascarya suddhi- 
prakssanam t prayascittam oatuspadam vihitam dharmakartr- 
hhihn"). 

It is not necessary heTe to set out the details of the consti- 
tution of the parisad, of the qualifications of the sistas who 
were to be the members of the parted and their privileges and 
duties These points have already been discussed at length in 
H of Dh. vol If. pp. 966-974. A few matters not stated there 
are mentioned here Caste exclusiveness and pride had gone 
so far that Parasara (VUU. 25) and the Caturvimsatimata 
quoted by Par M. state that a dmj a though he may be of bad 
character is to be honoured and not a sudra who may have 
controlled his senses, that the advice of a sudra even though 
learned and devoted to the knowledge of the sastras should not. 
be accepted like sacrificial food when licked by a dog 203 . In-,

gular abbreviation) is employed in several smrti passages* 3 *. 
Parasara (VX 55-57) provides that the assembly should take 
compassion on the weak, on boys and old men and should reduce 
the penance, but not otherwise and that if learned men through 
affection, greed, fear or ignorance reduce the penance that 
should be prescribed they themselves incur the sin M36 Devala 
says the same and adds 201 that the reduction in the penance 
should not be directed by one man alone or by a person ignorant 
of Dharmasastra and that it is only a number of br&hmanas 
who are proficient in Dharmasastra that are entitled to reducs 
the penance through compassion for the sinner. The decision 
of the assembly should be unanimous 205 as far as possible 

If the learned brahmanas of the assembly knowing the 
proper prayascitta do not declare it in the case of those who are 
distressed by their own sin and seek direction, they incur sin 
similar to that of the seeker after proper penance 204 .

CHAPTER IV 
PENANCES FOR PARTICULAR SINS 

It is now proper to turn to the penances prescribed for 
individual sins of different types (grave sins, minor sins and the 
like). It may be noted that the smrtis contain numerous 
prayascittas for the same sin and that it is often difficult to 
reconcile all the dicta The commentaries and digests such as 
the Mit and the Prayaseitta-viveka therefore try to assign to 
each penance an appropriate provision, looking to all the circum- 
stances noted above (i.e they are bent on 'visayavyavastha'). 206 " 
In this work, it is not necessary to set out in detail the 
numerous penances for numberless lapses that are prescribed 
in the several smrtis and digests. In the Sabdakalpadruma (part 
HI) there is an analysis from the Prayaseitta-viveka alone of the 
several lapses, the penances for them, the number of cows to be 
donated as substitutes, the monetary equivalents when even 
cows cannot be donated and the dalcsma in each case, which 
occupy pages 321 to 364. Setting out all these lapses together 
with the penances for them would only be a matter of academic 
interest and of no practical value, as almost all the prayascittas 
have become antiquated and are hardly ever performed now 
excspt in the form of gifts of cows or money to brahmanas, 
pilgrimages and recitation of Yedie mantras or japa of the 
names of some favourite deity such as Visnu or Siva. Therefore 
only a few typical sins alone will he taken for treatment here 
and later on a list of all penances with brief descriptions will be 
furnished. 

First come the Mahapatakas. Sankha m (17. 1-3) prescribes 
the following penance for the four "mahapatakas: the sinner 
should bathe thrice every day, should erect in a forest a cottage 
thatched with leaves, should sleep on the ground, should subsist

on leaves, roots and fruits, should enter a village for alms all 
the time declaring his misdeed, should eat only once a day. 
When the 12th year passes in this way, the thief of gold, the 
drinker of sura, the murderer of a brahmana and one who is 
guilty of incest become free from sin. Visnu Dh S. 34.1 spaaka 
of sexual intercourse with one's mother, daughter or daughter- 
in-law as ohpataha and (34.2) provides that there is no penance 
except entering fire for this grave sin. The Bhavisyapurana, 
Harita and Samvarta (q. bythePr. V p 43) say the same 
But other smrtis like Manu XI. 54 and Yfij Ht 227 treat matr- 
gamana as a mahapataka (gurutalpa-gatnana) and intercourse 
with the daughter or daughter-in-law as equal to violating 
guru's bed (Manu XT. 58, Yaj. BX 233-234). Therefore we 
begin with the mahapatakas the first of which is the murder 
of a brahmana Gaut. 22 2-10, Ap Dh. S 1 9. 24 1<M5 and I, 
9 25 12-13, Vas 20. 25-28, Visnu Dharmasutra 35. 6 and 50. 
1-6 and 15, Manu. XI 72-82, Yaj HI 243-250, AgnipurSna 
169. 1-4 and 173 7-8, Samvarta 110-115 and many othera 
prescriba various penances for brShmana-murder. As the treat- 
ment of Manu is tolerably long, an analysis of it alone will be 
given here. Manu as stated by the Bhavisyapurana (quoted 
by Znllufca on Manu XL 72-82, Apararka p 1055 and Pr V. 
p 63) speaks of 13 separate penances for brahmdltatya m . The 
general rule was that for a man of any class who is directly 
guilty of intentional murder of a brahmana the penance was to 
end in death 209 . The thirteen penances as set out hy 
Govindananda m his commentary (called TattrartliakaumudI ) 
on Prayascittaviveka (p 63) are as follows — 

(1) The murderer of a brahmana should construct a hut 
in a forest and dwell therein for twelve years, should subsist on 
alms and should carry a piece of the head-bones of the vf iB ™ 
man on a staff. This is a very ancient penance and otnei 
smrtis add some details. For example, Gaut 22 4P^ ld %.®T 
the sinner should suhmit to observances meant for a veo 
student (such as not partaking of flesh, howjtajtateaj^

and that if he got no food at the seven houses he had to go witn- 
out food that day and that he should protect cows and may for 
that purpose (for taking them out for grazing or bringing them- 
back) enter the village again. The Mit. ton Yai HI. 243) adds 
that the staff with head-bone on and the head-bone carried ia- 
the left hand are merely symbolic (in order to remind him -and 
others of his being guilty of brahmana. murder), that he should 
on seeing an wya avoid his path (Gaut. 22: 5), -that- hb- 
should keep standing by day and only sit down at night 
(Gaut. 82. 6) and bathe thrice in the day (Gaut. %%. 6). K is- 
added by the Mit. that, if the murdered brahmana's head-bone 
cannot be had, that of any other brahmana would do. The Mit. 
adds that this wata* for twelve years propounded by Gautama, - 
Manu, Yajfiavalkya and others is one and not different for 
each smrti and therefore a]] the details that are not opposed to 
each other should be included. Apararka p. 1053 (on Ysj. HL

that there would be an option where the details of several 
smrfcis are in conflict. It was VisvarQpa* 12 on Yaj. M. 237 who 
held that the procedure prescribed by each smrti was separata 
and that all details taken from different smrfcis were not to be 
mixed up. According to the Mit. and Kulluka (on Manu XI. 
¥2 ) this vrata for 12 years is appropriate in the case where a 
brahmana is murdered unintentionally and Kulluka quoting 
Angiras provides that for intentional brahmana murder the 
penance will be double (i. e. 24 years). The Mit (on Yaj. IE. 
243 ) states that this observance for twelve years applies only 
to onB who was himself directly the murderer of a brahmana 
and that the anugraJiaka has to undergo only 9 years' vrata, the 
prayojaka only six years, the anumanta only 4§ years and the 
mmittin only three years. It is further provided by the Mit. (on 
Yaj. ID. 243) following a verse ascribed to Manu (not found 
in the printed text) and Devala S13 that if a man commits 
several murders of brahmanas one after another, and performs 
penance at one time for them, for two murders he has to undergo 
the penance for 24 years and for three murders 36 years and 
When he commits the 4th murder there is no penance (hut 
only death is the penance). The Pr. T. (p. 468) on the other 
hand, 214 following the Bhavi9ya-purana holds that one per- 
formance of the 12 years' penance is enough penance for 
the murder of several brahmanas, on the analogy of the 
Ksamaoatl tsti (Jai. VI. 4. 17-20) which is performed when 
both the purodasas and the house are totally burnt up by 
accident before the oblations are offered. The Pr. Prakssa 
( folio 19 a ) also says the same and adds that Devala's verse is 
to be interpreted as laying down that repetition of the same 
sinful act is more blamable. If the murderer of a brahmana

brahmana he may-at his will enter a fight and if he were killed,

subsequently recovered he should be free from the sin of

Gfaut. 22.2, Maau XL 74, Yaj. HL 247, he may cut off with an-

ance is for intentional murder of a brahmana by a ksatriya acoJ

dharmaalifra ( chap. 35 last verse ) states that all persons guilty' 
Of any of the 'mah&patakas are purified by the performance of 
Asvamedha Or by going to all the tirthas on the earth. 

(9 ) Manu XI 75 provides that for the removal of the sin 
of Jrrahmahaty a, the sinner may walk one hundred yojanas, sub- 
sisting on limited food, controlling his senses and reciting one 
of the four Yedas. Kulluka says that this applies only where 
the killing is unintentional and the victim is a mere brahmana 
by caste (L e. has not studied the Veda &o. ), For yojama, vide 
H. of Dh. vol DX p. 145 note 185.2". 

(10) Manu XL 76 provides that the murderer of a brah- 
tnana may make a gift of all his wealth to a brahmana who has; 
studied the Veda. 

(11) Manu XL 76 and Ysj IH 250 provide that the mur-' 
derer may donate to a worthy brahmana (who has studied the, 
Veda and whose character is good) as much wealth as would 
snffioe to maintain the latter throughout his life and a house 
with all paraphernalia. His is the view of Govindsnanda. 
But the Mit. on YSj. ID. 250 appears to hold that Nos 10 and 
11 are not separate penances It combines the two into one, 
viz. that if the murderer has no offspring then he was to donate 
all his wealth or if he had offspring he was to donate a bouse 
with paraphernalia. This explanation is certainly preferable. 
The Smrtyarthasara ( p 105 ) states that if the murderer is 
devoid of qualities but is well-off he may give a house and lands 
sufficient for the maintenance of a worthy brahmana or he may 
donate a house with appurtenances or if he be childless all 
his wealth.

ghee 1 ) should follow the course of the ( holy ) river Sarasvatl in 
all its branches. This, aoc. to the Bhavisyapur&na and Kulluka, 1 
applies where a mere brahmana by caste (without Vedic learning) 
is killed intentionally by a man who is himself rich but has no 
vedio learning. The words 'pratisrotah sarasvatun ' have been 
variously explained. Medhatifchi explains as above. Apararka, 
Sarvajfianarayana and KtghavSnanda explain that the murderer 
should follow the course of the SarasvatI in the opposite direc- 
tion from the sea to its origin. This appears to be a better 
explanation, since it brings out the force of ' pratisrotah ' more, 
clearly 

(13) It is provided by Manu XL 77 and Yaj. m. 249 that 
the murderer should recite in a forest thrice the safofata text of 
the Veda, while subsisting on limited food. The express 
mention of saihhita text precludes the pada text or lemma. The 
Bhavisyapurana and Kulluka hold that this penance is proper 
where a mere brahmana by birth ( without Vedic learning ) is 
killed unintentionally. 

Manu 73 79, Yaj. HI. 244 and 346, Vas. 20. 27-38 and Gaut. 
22, 7-8 and 11 mention three more penances, but they are not 
independent ones ( as is made clear by Sankha). If a murderer, 
while undergoing the 12 years* penance, rights him who attacks 
a brahmana and saves him ( or fights for the king, aco. to Vas. )' 
or dies in the attempt, he becomes at once free from the sin and 
if he lives after the fight he had not to continue the penance 
for the whole period. The same applies to the saving of IS 
cows by the murderer by putting his own life in danger** 
Similarly, if a murderer fights a marauder depriving a 
brshmana of all his wealth and restores the wealth to a 
br&hmana or dies ,n the attempt or is severely wounded ( thrice

Manu XL 82, Yaj HI 244, Sankha and Gaut 22.9 lay down 
that if the murderer of a brahmana announces his sin when the 
king and priests have met together for the ceremonial bath after 
the Asvamedha sacrifice and being permitted by them bathes 
along with them, he becomes free from the sin.* According to 
Haradatta this is an independent penance, while according to 
the Mit on Yaj JH. 344, Apararka p. 1057 and others it is not so 
but is to be performed while undergoing the 13 years' penancs. - 

Ysj. HE. 245 provides that if the murderer treats and cures 
a "brahmana or a cow ( or cows ) lying helpless on the public road 
suffering from a long-standing and serious ailment he becomes 
freB from the sin. 

ParasaTa (XH. 65-67) prescribes for ora7ima7?o/i/3 the 
penance of going to the sea and Rama's bridge, begging and 
declaring on the way one's sin, walking without an umbrella or 
shoes and residing in cowpens, forests, iTrfhas and river 
streams; on seeing the se/w he was to bathe in the ocean and on 
return to feed brahmanas at a dinner and to donate 100 cows to' 
learned brahmanas. 

There are other penances for brahvuhafm mentioned hr 
Jamadagni, Atri, Kasyapa and others quoted by Ap3rarka 
( pp. 1064-1065 ) and others which are passed over here for want 
of space. 

If a brahmana killed his own father, mother, full brother, 
his teacher of the Veda, a brahmana who has studied the Veda 
or has consecrated sacred Vedic fires, hB had to undergo penancs 
till his last breath (ace to Pr. Prakarana p. 13 quoting Bhavisys- 
purana, Pr. V. pp. 70-71, Smrtimukt3phala Pr. p S73 quoting 
Daksa IH. 27-28 and Ap. Dh. 8 1.9 24). If a man killed a priest 
that was engaged at a soma sacrifice the penance was doable 
(Yaj 10.252). The Pr. Prakarana (p 13) says that this 
means that the murderer should perform 12 years' psnancs and 
then donate cows 221 in proportion to the difference between hi=

hanging himself or by taking poison or by falling from a 

precipice or the dome of a temple or by cutting his belly with a 

weapon or by fasting, does not dia, but luckily lives, he has to 

undergo aprayascitta for three years (acc.toPr. Prakarana 

p. 15). Vas. 23.18-19 and Paxasara XEL5-8 prescribe other 

pr&yasctttas for such persons ( who are styled l pratyavasita' ). 

Pr. Prakarana (p. 15) and Pr.V. (p. 75) quote two verses 

of Yama 22U for nine kinds of pratyavastta and prescribe 

Candrayana or two Taptakrcohras for them. 

If a ksatriya, vaisya or s&dra intentionally and directly 
killed a brahmana, the expiation was death, but otherwise each 
had respectively to undergo twice, thrice or four times as milch 
praya&oitta as a brahmana sinner would have had to undergo 
for killing a brahmana. 222 Conversely, if a brahmana killed a 
ksatriya or vaisya or a sudra the sin was only an upapataka 
(ace. to Ya]. m. 236 and Manu XL 66 ), unless the ksatriya or 
vaisya victim was engaged in performing a soma sacrifice 
(SamavidhanaBr.1.7. 5, Yaj.Ul 351, Vas. 20. 34) when the 
penance was heavy. Yaj. IE. 266-267, Manu XI. 126-130 and

killing a ksatriya is a little less (i.e.byj) than the penance 
for a brahmana killing a ksatriya Vide the verse "vipre tu. 
sakalam deyam' quoted above (note 192). 

Women victims were placed on the same footing as ksatriya 
vaiSya and sudra males ( Yfij. TO. 236 and Manu XI 66), except 
the cases where the woman was an Atreyl or pregnant or in her 
monthly illness (Gaut 22 17, Ap Dh. S. 1. 9. 24. 5 and 9, Baud. 
Dh. S. II. 1.10, 12-13, Vas 20 34, Visnu Dh. S. 50 7-9) or the 
wife of a twice-horn performing a soma sacrifice, when the 
penance was heavy (like the one for brahmahatya) The period, 
of soma-yaga was reckoned from the Dlksanvja isti to the 
Udamsanrtja (a.ca totheMit) or up to the end of avabhtlha 
bath ( ace. to Aparfirka ). For killing women guilty of adultery 
the penances were higher and varied according to the caste of 
the paramour and of the woman (vide Gaut 22.26-27, Manu 
XL 138, Yaj BX 268-269 ). 

Manu (XI. 208=Visnu Dh. S 54 30) and Yaj Itt 293 
prescribe that for threatening to beat or strike a brahmana the 
penance is krechra, for striking him it is Ati-krochra, for shedd- 
ing his blood a Krechra and Atikrcehra. The Samavidhana Br, 
I. 7. 4 prescribes other penances (i. e. recitation of certain 
saman texts) for these. 

Gaut. 23.1, 23 Ap Dh S. I 9 25.3, Baud. Dh. S. E 1. 21., 
Vas. 20.22, Manu XL 90-91, Yaj. U3. 253 and Brhaspati 
prescribe that if a brahmana drinks intentionally spirituous 
liquor prepared from flour even once he has to undergo a pen- 
ance that ends in death, viz. he has to drink that liquor boiling, 
hot or to drink boiling hot cow's urine, milk, ghee, water or 
liquid cow-dung, and when his body has been completely scalded 
thereby and he dies he becomes free from that sin. Some like 
Haradatta on Gaut. 23 1 hold that this horrible penance is 
meant for one who knowingly and repeatedly drinks sufa ( ma £" 
ufactured from rice flour). Manu XL 92 and Yaj. BX 254 
prescribe another penance in place of the one ending in death 
viz. that the sinner should eat during one year (during thre e

years, ace. to Yaj.) once "(a day) at night the (boiled) email 
grains of rice, or .oilcake, should wear clothes made of cow's 
hair, should have matted hair on his head and carry a flagstaff 
(with a wine cup thereon). The same rules apply to a ksatriya or 
vaisya drinking sura (manufactured from rice flour). Only they 
have as stated above (in note 192) to undergo three-fourths and 
one-half respectively of the penance for a brahmana sinner. 
This penance was to be undertaken after vomiting the contents 
of the stomach. According to the Madanapsrijata ( p. 818 ), Pr. 
V.p 104, Pr Pfakaranap.43,Mit. (on Yaj III. 24) and other 
works the twelve years' penance is meant for one who drinks 
s«r5( made from flour) through ignorance or force. According 
to Gaut 23. 2-3, Yaj. HI 255, Mann. XI. 146, Atri 75, for drink- 
ing intoxicants or human semen, ordure or urine through 
ignorance a person of the three first classes had first to undergo 
the penance called Taptakrcchra and then his wpamyana was 
again performed. Vasistha 30.19 prescribes for drinking any 
intoxicant unintentionally the penances of Krcchra and 
Atikrcchra, the drinking of ghee and the performing of 
upanayana again. There is great divergence of views about 
Manu XI. 146 and Yaj in. 255 which is passed over here. 
Brhaapati »* quoted by the Mit , AparSrka and others prescribes 
thatabrShmana who drinks sura prepared from raw sugar

paistl variety. TJid Mit (on Yaj III, 243) holds that 
since Maim XL S3 generally forbids fcho drinking of aura on 
the part of bruhmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas the prohibi- 
tion applies ovon to boys who have not undergone the rita 
of vpanaywi and girls who are not yet married and adds 
that for drinking sum the child has to undergo only one- 
fourth penance ( for 3 years ) if the offence was uninten- 
tional and double of that ( 6 year-s ) if it was intentional 
(vide also "Pr. prakarana p 48). The Kalpataru, it appears, held, 
relying on Gaufc II. 1 ( 'before upanayana a child may do as it 
pleases as regards behaviour, speech and eating ' ), that no em 
(don) was incurred by a child before upanayana and by a girl 
before marriage for drinking sura. The Pr. "V (p. 104) and 
Fr. Prakasa criticize the Kalpatara for this view. 2 " As 
Brhaspati states (vide n, 188 above) the license allowed by 
Gautama is limited by fcho Mit and other digests to the par- 
taking of sour or stale drinks and the like and is not extended 
to drinking sura which is a mahSpStaka Jatukarnya 2 * 5 (q, by 
the Par. M. ) provides that if a boy whose upanayana has not

unclean excretions of the body (Manu Y. 134) or any of 

the several kinds of intoxicating drinks and for eating gariie

the flesh of village pigs, of tame cocks, of apes and of cows and 

then adds ( in sutra 4 ) that they ( the sinners ) must undergo 

fresh iipcmtiyam also The smrtis provide different prSya&cittas 

for various lapses about drinking and eating such as drinking 

water from a pot which had already been used for holding sura, 

for drinking water from the water vessel of a candala or of a 

washerman or from a sudra's house or for drinking milk which 

should not he drunk (Gaut rm-26, Yaj 1. 170, Manu V. 8-10 ), 

foresting forbidden food, which must be passed over here, 

because 229 they are too many and too various and depend on 

circumstances for their application as observed by the Pr. V 

and because they are now of academic interest alone. Some 

reference, however, may be made to show how some of these 

lapses were treated. Sankha states that there are many 

articles that are allowed or forbidden to men, particularly to 

brahmanas and in cases of transgressions the decision rests with 

tbe hsfas (the pansad of respectable people). Brhaspati 230 

(quoted by Apararka) prescribes that in the case of the partaking 

of things that should not be licked or drunk or eaten or in case 

of taking in human semen, urine or ordure, the penance of a 

candrayana is the purification Some of the sages such as 

Samvarta, Sankha-hkhita took a lenient view, prescribed

make efforts to vomit it and if that is impossible he should 
quickly take some prayasoitta ( which is slight in the case of 
ignorance ). It may be mentioned that even from very ancient 
times exceptions were recognised to the prohibitions against the 
partaking of forbidden food The Chandogya Upanisad (1. 10J lM 
narrates the story of Usasti CakrSyana, who when the country 
of tho Kurus had been devastated by hailstones ( or by locusts), 
begged ( along with his very young wife ) of a chief eating 
boans and took from the latter the beans that had been put 
away for the chief (and so were ucdnsta), but when asked to 
take water for drinking meant for the chief replied that if he 
drank of it he would be drinking what was unclean, since ho 
could get water whenever he liked. This Vedic passage 
indicates that oven unclean things may be eaten when there is 
distress (Sporf) or danger to life, but that when there is no distress 
or danger even one who has knowledge of In ahmauiclya should 
not violate the injunctions of sastra about eating. The 
Vedantasutra (ITI.428) has an aphorism on this incident 
Manu X.104 provides that he who, when in danger of losing 
his life, accepts food from any parson whatsoever is not tainted 
by sin as the sky is not tainted by mud Manu then refers 
(X 105-108) to the stories of AtfgaTta who, when famished, 
approached for slaying his own son, of the sage Vamadeva who 
when tormented by hunger desired to eat the flesh of a dog in 
order to save his life and did not sully himself, of BharadvSja 
who when distressed by hunger along with his son in a lonely 
forest accepted many cows from the carpenter Vrdhu (BrbuY) 
or of Visvamitra who, well knowing what was right or wrong, 
proceeded, when tormented by hunger, to eat the haunch of a 
dog, receiving it from the hands of a Ca ndala 332a

IV] Prayasattas for other Makapataltas 101 

For eating the flesh of various birds Visnu Dh. S. 51. 29 
and 31 and others prescribe fasting for three days or one day 
and also for eating several varieties of fish ( Visnu 51.21 ). 

We may now revert to the penances for th© othei Maha- 
patakas. It has already been seen how the thief that had stolen 
a brahmana's gold of a certain weight was to approach the king 
with a club (p. 73 above). Even Ap.Dh. S. 1 9.25.4 refers to this 
and prescribes as an option (Ap Dh. S. 1.9 25.6-7) entering into 
fire as an expiation for theft or starving oneself by reducing the 
intake of food. Therefore, the penance for the theft of 
brahmana's gold of the weight of 80 raUiKas or more (Manu 
VTA. 134 and Yaj 1363) was death for the offenders of all 
vamas, except a brahmana offender, who clad in rags (or bark 
garment) was to undergo a penance in a forest for twelve years 
of the same kind as for brahmana murder (Manu XI. 101 ) or 
for the drinking of mi a prepared from flour (Yaj HL258). 
The offender may also give as much gold (if he is rich) as his 
own weight or as much wealth a3 would be required for the 
maintenance of a brahmana's family for the latter's lifetime 
(Yaj. HI 258 and Mit. thereon) The Ap Dh. S. I. 9 25 8 
provides the observance of the penance of Krcchra for one year 
(as defined in Ap Dh. S I 9 27 7-8) and quotes a verse "those 
who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous liquor, 
or had connection with a guru's wife, but not those who have 
slain a brahmana, shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, 
bathe thrice a day, pass the day standing and the night 
sitting; after the lapse of three years they cast off their sins." 232 * 
The digests contain numerous and varying expiations for 
theft depending upon the weight of gold stolen, upon the 
qualities of the man robbad and of the thief, upon the caste 
of both, tipon whether it is a first offence or a repeated 
one, on the priea and nature of the thing stolen and on the 
time and place and so on Vide Pr V. pp. 117-127, Pr. Sara 
p 49, MadanapSrijata pp 828-834, Smrtyarthasara pp. 108-109, 
Smrtimuktaphala pp 883-885. These have to be passed over 
here for reasons of space. 

If th-! gold stolen (even from a brahmana) was less than 
80 raktikas or if gold of any weight was stolen from a ksatriya

or any other non-brahmana, the expiation would ha as one for 
anupapataka Manu (XI 162-168 =Matsyapur5na 227. 41-47) 
and Visnu 52. 5-13 prescribe various penances such as krcchra 
for a year for the theft of corn or cooked food or wealth ; 
candrayana for abducting men and women (slaveB ) or for 
appropriating a field or house and the water of wells and 
cisterns; aantapana for thefts of objects of small value; 
pancagavya for stealing eatables of various kinds or a vehicle 
or a bed or a seat or flowers or roots and fruits ; fasting for 
three days and nights in the case of theft of grass, wood, trees, 
dry food, molasses, clothes, leather (or armour) and flesh, 
subsisting for twelve days on small grains of rice for stealing 
gems, pearls, coral, copper, silver, iron, bell-metal or stones , 
subsisting on milk alone for the theft of cotton, silk, wool, 
animals with cloven hoofs (cows &c.) or uncloven hoofs (horses 
&c ), birds, perfumes, medicinal herbs or a rope (used for 
drawing water). It must be remembered as stated above (p. 74) 
that the thief had to restore to the owner the thing stolen and 
then undergo a penance (Manu XI164 and Visnu Dh S 52.14) 
and Medhatithi (on Manu XI 164) adds that if he is unable to 
restore the thing (or its price) the psnanoe is to be double. 
Besides, in certain cases of theft if corporal punishment or 
death was not inflicted by the king, the thief was fined eleven 
times the price of the thing stolen (Manu VJIL 321, 323, Visnu 
Dh S. 5.83 )**» 

Simla (theft) is of two kinds, by force (such as robbery and 
dacoity and called sShasa) and by clandestine means, to the 
farmer case the penance goes on increasing (twice, thrice; 
according as the offender is a ksatriya or vaisya(^«* 
biahmamnum, quoted above, Par. M. H part 1 p.231 ) In . t» 
case of theft by clandestine means if the owner whose gow or 
wealth is stolen is a brahmana and the thief a ^atriya orvaisya, 
then also the penance must be higher than for a brahmana 
thief (since, as, Narada says in his chapter on sSte verse 10, 
the wealth belonging to idols, brahmanas and ^%^™ 3 
But conversely, if the owner of stolen property Is of low™* 
Sx Zthief then the verse of Brhad-Visnu ( 'vipre tu sakalam 
deyam,' quoted above in note 192) will apply.

IV" ] Penance for incest 103 

The penance for incest with the gum's wife was prescribed 
from very ancient times as follows: Gaut. m 23. 8-11, iLp. Dh. 
S. L 9.25. 1-2, Band. Dh. S. U. 1. 14-16 (almost in the same words 
as inGant), Vas. 20. 13-14, Manu XI, 103-104 prescribe that the 
offender shall confess his guilt and then extend himself on a 
red-hot iron bed or embrace the red-hot iron image of a woman 
or having himself cut off his organ and testicles and having 
taken them in his joined hands may walk straight towards the 
south or south-west until he falls down dead and "that he 
becomes purified by death. According to the Mit. on Yaj. HL 
S59 the three are not distinct penances, but that two of them, 
viz. embracing the red-hot iron image of a woman and sleeping 
on a bed of red hot iron form one penance. The words of Yaj. 
no doubt convey that the two together are one penance ( viz. 
sleeping on red hot bed and clinging to a red hot image ). 
Others like the Madanaptrijata (p. 837), Medhatithi ^ on 
Manu XI. 103 do not accept this interpretation. The latter 
moreover relies on Gautama who employs the word 'va* 
(or) in the two latter of his three sutras on this point 
ThePr. V. (p,13S) points out this difference between Gaut 
and Yaj. Manu XI 58 and 170-71, Yaj. HI 231, Sarhvarta

10-* History of Dharmaiastia [Vol. 

Paraiara (X 10-11) provides three different prayascittas, viz. 
excision of the organ, three Ircclaas or three candi ayanas if a 
man commits incest with his mother, sister, or daughter and in 
X. 12-14 prescribes other penances for adultery with other 
near female relatives The Mit on Yaj. HI 259 quotes Sankha 
for twelve years' penance for all four kinds of Mahapatakas, 
which applies aco to it to intercourse with guru's wife of 
the same class. It is not necessary to quote further smrti 
passage's which vary greatly as to the extent of the penance 
Manu XL 178 ( = Visnu Dh S 53. 9 = Agnipurana 169 41), 
Santi 165 29 state that the sin which a twice-born man com- 
mits by sexual intercourse for one night with a vrsalt^ 6 (a 
candala woman) is removed by him by the penance of subsist- 
ing on alms for three years and reciting mantras (like the 
Gayatrl). Ap. Dh S.I 9 27.11 has a somewhat similar verse 
about a brahmana's intercourse with a sudra woman 237 . Y5j 
ITT, 233 prescribes for women death as a legal penalty and the 
same prayascitta as for a male if a man has sexual intercourse 
with his paternal or maternal aunt, or daughter-in-law, 
matemal uncle's wife and others (enumerated above) with their 
consent Manu XL 175 ( = Laghu-Satatapa 155 = Agnipurana 
169 33) holds that a brahmana, who has sexual intercourse with 
a candala woman or mleccha woman or dines, with cav4alas at 
mlecclias or accepts gifts from them, has to perform penance as 
if he were pahta if he unknowingly did these things, and be- 
comes like them by committing these sins knowingly com- 
pare Vasistha 23 41, Visnu Dh. S 53 5-6. 

K a woman be guilty of a MahapStaka the general rah 
stated by Manu XI 176 (latter half), Katyayana and Brhaspat 
was that whatever penance was prescribed for a .male n low « 
of adultery *ith other's wives the same was to ^ atom *

IV] Prayascitta for adulteress 105 

cute case the rule about half psnancs being prescribad for 
women did not hold good when a woman with full knowledge 
committed adultery and half penance was to be prescribed only 
where the adultery was through mistake. A. similar rule was 
laid down by Angiras 233 ". If a woman became patita and did 
not undergo prayascitta she could be excommunicated by the 
process called ghatasphola (described in'H. of Dh.yol. HI pp. 
615-616 and 1009}. But there was a difference between a male 
and a woman in this respect. A. woman, however, was not to be 
altogether abandoned on the street and left to fare for herself, 
though she be patita, but she was to be lodged in a 
cottage thatched with grass near the house and was to be 
guarde'd against further lapses and given bare maintenance 
( enough to keep body and soul together ) and ( dirty ) clothes 
( Yaj. IIL 296, Mann XL 176 ). There were certain acts, however, 
which were specially condemned in women {Yaj. M. 297) viz. 
sexual intercourse with a man of a lower class, causing abortion 
and killing the husband. Vas. 31. 10 provides *» that four 
classes of women may be altogether abandoned (and not given 
even starving maintenance &c ) viz. a woman who has sbxual" 
intercourse wrth (her husband's) pupil or with his gum or one 
who i-ilis her husband or one who sexually approaches a man of 
a lower degraded class. Women, however paltta they may be, 
were to be dealt with as stated in Yaj. HI 296 even if they did 
tot perform any penance Vas. 21.13 statss that women of the 
tohmana, ksatnya and vaisya classes, if gnilty of sexual 
intercourse with a s5 dra, can be purified by pemnTe 5 they do

of the four mahapatakas lias to undergo the i jsta(she observ- 
ances) prescribed for that grave sinner in order to free himself 
from the sin of association Eulluka, the Pr sara (p. 61) and 
others state that the penance here referred to is the one for twelve 
years and not death since it is the word vrata that is employed 
by Manu and vrata does not ordinarily convey the idea of 
death. 210 If the association was due to ignorance the penance 
was half. Vyasa prescribed au for the knowing associator J tbs 
of the penance provided for the sinner himself. According to 
the Pr. V (p 171 ) there was no difference in the extent of the 
penance for association with a sinner in the case of a 
brahmana 2 " and a sudra, though in other cases penance was 
reduced by one quarter for each varaa. If the association was 
for less than one year, then the penance was proportionately 
reduced. Not only was the patita condemned but even Ms son 
born after he became pattta and he was excluded from inheritance. 
But the daughter of a pah ta was treated differently and she 
could be married without any stigma being attached to the 
husband. Vide Vas. 13 51-53, Yaj. m 261, Baud Dh. S IL 1- 
.73-74, Hartta q ly Pr V. p 174 and Pr prakarana p 110 and 
H of Dh vol III pp. 614-616. 

VisnuDh S (chap 36) speaks of osrtain sins as onupo/ato 
which are declared by Manu (XL 55-58) and Yaj (HL 228-233) 
to be equal to or like one or other of the mahapatakas and 
provides that those guilty of them become pure by Asvamedfia 
sacrifice or by resorting to pilgrimages It has also been wan 
that such sins are removed by the penances that are sligntiy »» 
(i. e. by Jth) than those for the mahapatakas themselves 

The penances for upapatakas must now be briefly dealt

a few of them that are of some importance will be dealt with 
individually. The Samavidhana ^ Br. (L 5.14) states that on 
committing several upapatakas a man becomes pure by reciting 
thrice the whole of the veda while fasting. Manu XI. 117, Yaj. 
IH 265, Yisnu Dh. S. 37 35 prescribe that purification from all 
classes of upapatakas (except the sin of the avalcirydri) is effected 
by the same penances that are prescribed for govadha or by 
cavdrayana or by subsisting on milk alone for a month or by 
Paraka or Gosava. The digests prescribe that Paraka is meant 
for him who is strong enough to undertake it, Candrayana for 
him who is weak, Gosava for him who repeatedly commits the 
same upapataka or is guilty of several at the same time ( vide 
Pr. Prakasa, folio 132 a). 

Qooadlia stands at the head of upapatakas in Manu, Yaj 
the AgnipurSna (168 39-37). Several smrtis provide different 
penances for the sin of killing a cow. Gaut. 22. 18 prescribes*** 
the same penance for govadha as for killing a vaisya (Gaut. 
<S8. 15) viz. staying for .three years in a forest, subsisting on 
alms, observing celibacy and donating one hundred cows toge- 
ther with a bull. TnAp.Dh. S.I.9.26. 1 for killing a milch

fast for 25 days and nights subsisting on panoagavya, should 
tonsure his head together with the top-knot, should wear as an 
upper garment cow-hide and should follow cows, lie down in a 
cow-pen and donate a cow. Some of the smrtis and digests 
declare that the penance differed according as the cow that was 
killed belonged to a learned brahmana or to a mere brahmana 
by caste, to a kaatriya or vaisya or sudra For example, Devala 
(q. byPr. V. p 202 ) states that if a cow belonging to a brah- 
mana were killed, then the sinner should wear as upper garment 
that cow's hide for six months, should bring fodder for eows 
should imitate cows, should subsist on barley gruel, should move 
among cows and then he becomes free fiom the sin. Satatapa 
(q. by Pr V. p 203 ) states that one killing the cow of a vaisya 
should subsist on paficagavya fox a month, should recite the 
Gomati-vidya 2 " and stay in a cowpen for a month, Visva- 
mitra (Pr. V. p 203) says about the killer of a cow belonging 
to a sudra that he should undergo four krcchras if he kills 
intentionally and two if unintentionally. The Gomati-wdtja as 
quoted by Apararka (p. 1102), the Madana-panjata (p. 862) and 
Pr T. p 522 (which takes it from the Frayascitta section of the 
Kalpataru that takes it from Yama) is a laudation of cows: 'cows 
always emit fragrance, they have the smell of guggulu (bdellium), 
they are the support of beings, they are a great blessing, cows are 
(yield in their milk) the best food and the best offerings for gods; 
they are purifiers of all beings and offerings ooze from them; 
they please the gods in heaven by the offerings (of milk and 
ghee) that are rendered pure by the mantias recitsd over them ;

penances for govadha, which are to be explained away by 
reference to the killing being intentional or unintentional or to 
the fact of the cow being owned by a brahmana engaged in a 
soma sacriBce or by a brahmana who has studied the Veda 
with the six auxiliary sastras, or by the fact that the cow was

110 History of Dharmaiastra [Vol. 

The Samavidhana Br (I 7.8 ) prescribes that on killing any 
animal (except a cow or bull) the guilty person should fast for 
one night and recite the samaveda verse 'Agnis-tigmena' (L 1 
3 2) 5p. Dh S (I 9.25.14) provides for killing a crow, a 
chameleon, a peacock, a chakiavaka, hamsa, bhasa, a frog, 
ichneumon, musk-rat, a dog the same panance as for killing a 
sfldra. Gaut 22 19-22, 24-25, Manu XI. 133-137, Yaj HL 
269-274, Visnu Dh. S 50.25-32, Parasara VI 1-15 prescribe 
several penances for killing an elephant, a horse, a tiger, a 
monkey, a cat, a serpent and numerous other animals, which 
are passed over here Some smrtis such as Samvarta 10 and 
Paithinasi make a difference between gramya and wanya (forest) 
animals, in each class seven being specificed by Paithinasi 21 
The great concern of the sages for anything possessed of the 
principle of life or growth went so far as to prescribe the 
penance of reciting one hundred rk verses if a man cut off big 
trees (like mango or jack-fruit tree) or shrubs and creepers, 
except for purposes of sacrifices or agriculture ** (Manu XL 
142, Yaj IIL 276, Vas 19. 11-12) These provisions tended 
against wanton destruction of trees, shrubs and forests that are 
so beneficent to humanity and lend a charm to the landscape. 

It is remarkable that in case a man was bitten by a harlot 
or a monkey or an ass or by a dog or jackal or a camel or a crow 
he had to perform (in addition to the pain of the bite) pMama 
while standing in water and to drink ghee for purification 
(Manu XL 199, Yaj. HI 277, Vas. 23. 31) ParSsara VV*

Lmedbrahmana. The Mit. on Yaj. ID. 265 quotes ^ numerous 
tests dealing with the penance for adultery that does not 
amount to a mah&pataka and tries to evolve order by assigning 
to each its proper province. This is passed over here. A 
woman guilty of adultery with a male of the same or higher 
castB than herself had to undergo the same penance as a male 
adulterer (Earni XI 176 and Brhaspati), but if she committed 
adultery with a male of lower caste, then the penances differed 
as stated above (vide Vas. 21. 1-5 and Sarhvarta 167-172). 
Brhadyama IV. 48 states that adultery in the inverse order of 
olasses is a grave sin, but adultery in the annloma order of 
classes entails different penances for purification from it. 253

such as the performance of Vratijastoma. and Uddaiakawata 
(Vas, XI. 76-79, Gaut. 19 8) are prescribed by some of these 
works, while Manu XI. 191 (=Vismi Dh. S. 54. 26-27=Agni-

then Upanayana is to he performed again. Vas. XI. 77 describes

Baud Dh. S n. 1. 35-43; Yaj. IE. 280, Agnipurana 169. 15-18, 
Par gr. HI. 12 contain similar provisions, Gautama adding that 
he shall hag for a year at seven houses with a red vessel 
(earthen) in his hand and proclaim his misdeed. The Baud. 
Dh S. and Par gr furnish elaborate details. The former states 
that the Pasupurodasa may be offered to Kaksas or to Yama or 
he may offer on the Amavasya, at night two offerings of clarified 
butter in fire after performing the preparatory rites of a dar vi- 
lloma and that he may then invoke fire with the verse (Tai. S. 
IT 18) 'Sam ma cincantu marutah &c. ' (may the Maruts grant 
me long life and strength). 

If an ascetic reverted to the life of a householder, Samvaita 
(171-172) prescribes the penance of krcchra for six months 157 . 
Such a man is called pralyaeasita. The pratyavasitas are said' 
to be of nine kinds *s by Yama (22-33), Brhad-Yama (3-4) 
and others viz. those who turn back from water, fire, halter (by 
means of which they wanted to kill themselves),' those who 
revert back from the stage of sarmySsa or from a fast (unto 
death), or from poison, precipice or sitting dharvB and those who 
desiring to commit suicide) strike themselves with a weapon 
(but are not killed), these nine are called praiyavasita and are 
beyond commerce with people, become pure by the penance of 
Cwidiwjam or two Taptakrcchras. Vrddha-Parasara quoted by 
Par. M. and Prayascitta-muktavali provides that sannyasins

rules of his asrama is called arudliapatifa also (ride Par M 11 
part I p 373 quoting Harita). 

Elaborate purifications are prescribed for removing the taint 
of touching ceitain men, unclean objects like bones (Manu V 
87), women in their monthly illness or within certain a.vrs after 
dehveiy and animals (like dogs, village pigs, cocks, crows). 
They have to be passed overbore for reasons of space. But a few 
passages may be cited by way of sample. Gautama a9 (14. 2S) 
provides that on touching paltta, candala, a woman freshlv 
delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpse, or on touch- 
ing any one who has touched any one of these or any one who 
is the thiid in contact, the purification is brought about by a 
bath with the clothes on. Manu V. 84 and Yaj HI 30 contain 
similar provisions The Pr. Y. (pp. 495-499) discusses the 
question whether spat sa ^ (touch) means direct touch or includes 
even indirect touch and ultimately arrives at the conclusion 
that indirect touch also is included and cites Apastamba-smrti 
in support that if a brahmana and a candala or the like aro both 
seated on the same branch (without actually touching each other) 
the brahmana can become purified only by a bath. A Yerse 
quoted as Yajuavalkya's by Pr. Prakarana #* p. 110 (not found 
in the printed text) states- 'on touching a candala, pnkkasa, 
mleccha, bhilla, a pcbasika (one coming from Persia) and the 
like and persons guilty of grave sins one should bathe with the 

clothes on.' The Sat-trimsan-mata 262 provides 'on touching

IV] Balh for touching cei tain persons 115 

BauddhaS, Pasupatas, Laukayatikas, atheists 'and those who 

follow forbidden aotions, one should plunge in water together 

with the clothes on. On touching a caifya tree (such as a fig 

tree round which a platform is built), a funeral pile (or brick 

altar prepared in the srauta rite called Agnioayana), a sacrificial 

post, a cartdala, one who sells the soma plant, a brahmana 

should enter water with the clothes on.' Samvarta ^ requires 

a rfrija to sip water on touching a shoemaker, a washerman, a 

lena (Manu 1L 19, 49, one who beats drum &c.}, a fisherman, 

a dancer [nata) and Satatapa 2S1 provides that if any limb of a 

duija (except the head) is touched by one who colours clothes, a 

shoemaker, a hunter, a fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a 

thala {Thug), an actor, one who allows sexual intercourse in the 

mouth, a dog, a prostitute allowing men of all vamas to "visit 

her, an oil-grinder, the keeper of a tavern, an executioner, a 

village pig or cock, he should wash the limb with water and 

perform acamana. If the head is touched by any one of these 

then he should bathe. In this connection it may be noted that 

Hemadri quotes (on p. 38) the Garudapurana and (on p 316) 

Parssaraforthelfi castes in a village that were treated as 

candslas m the matter of touch.-speeoh or sight. Devala (q hv

thoro being no untouohability on birth for any one except the

religious festivals and marriage processions those verses cannot

Tho smrtis woro very keen on keeping a high ideal before 
brfihmanas as regards rocciving gifts Tho Sama Br. (1. 7. 1-2) 
proscribes that if a brahmana rocoivos a gift from a ksatnya

mahisnsoakara' (Samavoda I 6. 1. 5. 10, No 542) for one month,

else from whom he should not accept it, he should undergo 
krcclita ponanco and rocite tho sama verse 'tnkadrukesu' 
(SSmavoda 1.5 2.3 1, No 457) Yaj 1 140 provides that a 
brrihnir.ua should not accopt a giffe-from a king who is parsimon- 
ious (or groody) and acts against tho dictates of sastra and 
Manu XT. 194 (=Visnu Dh. S 54.24) provides that a brahmana 
baoomos froo from tho sin of tho acceptance of a thing which 
should not bo accepted or of tho acceptance of a gift from a 
condomnod donor by reciting the Gayatrl three thousand tunas 
(in a month) or subsisting on milk alone or staying in a oo^an

III. 41 allow a brahmana when in distress to accept a gift from 
anybody or to tako food from anyone whatever oi to maintain 
himsolf by teaching any one whatever and state that he lsnot

male slaves, elephants, horses, bulls, fragrant substances, liquids, 
silken cloth (ksauma), black antelope hide, soma plant, water, in- 
digo; by selling these he at once incurs sin. As penance he should 
practise Tapta-tcrcchra for a year after tonsuring his head, he 
should enter water thrice, wear only one wet piece of cloth, 
should observe silence, should practise the Vlrasana, should sit 
up at night and stand by day, should recite the Gayatrl. 

One important matter dealt with by a few of the smrtis and 
some of the digests is the re-admission into the Hindu fold of 
those who were converted by force by the invading mlecchas. 
About the meaning of the word inleccha, there is some diver- 
gence of views. From the Sat. Br. (EL 21 23-2-1 ) it appears 
that the mlecchas spoke a degraded and corrupt speech ( such as 
saying 'helavah.' for 'hesrayah'). Parasara (IX. 36) refers 
to the mlecchas as the eaters of cow's flesh. The Pr. T. (p 549) 
quotes a smrti J6S text to the effect that a mleccha is an eater of 
cow's flesh and talks much that is contradictory, and cites a 
passage from the Harivarhsa for the manner of the dress and of 
the trimming of hair in the case of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, 
Paradas.Pahlavas &c. Vide for mleccha and for the return to the' 
Hindu fold of those that were forcibly carried away as slaves by 
mlecchas and robbers or made to kill cows or to eat the flesh of 
asses, camels, village pigs, H. of Dh. vol. II p 92, 383-385, 
389-392 (where verses of Devala ascribed by some like the Mit! 
to Apastamba-smrtf ate set out), 973-974 A few matters not 
dealt with theTe may be added here The VisnudharmottaTa »s 
purana (H. 73. 203-206) provides that when persons are kid- 
napped by mlecchas or raiders or persons passing through forests 
are so treated and return to their own country, the penances for 
purifying them from the sin of eating forbidden Jood are to be 
prescribed after considering their class (varna), viz that a

brahmana should undergo half krcchra penance and should have 
the Upanayana performed again, a ksatriya Bhould undergo 
three-fourths of Krcchra (and also upanayana), a vaiSya one- 
fourth Krcchra and a sfldra becomes pure by undergoing only •£ 
of a krcchra and by making a gift In view of the fact that 
Manu VIII 169, Visnu Dh. S. VII 6-7, Yaj II 89 declare 
that what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force and 
what is caused to be written by force and all transactions 
whatever that are brought about by force are void, and the 
burning desire of many people forcibly converted m times of 
disturbances to return to the Hindu fold and to the religion 
of their forefathers, the movement now called iuddhi 
should be encouraged by all interested in the well-being and 
stability of Hindu society It is better to call this return by 
the name of 'paravartana'. A model but brief rite for the 
pat avca tana of those who were forcibly converted or for those 
who voluntarily left the Hindu fold but want to return to it is 
given in the Appendix The same piayoga with suitable 
changes may be employed for taking into the Hindu fold any 
one who was not born a Hindu. In ancient times such people 
appear to have been taken into the Hindu fold by the perfor- 
mance of Vratyastoma. For this latter, vide H. of Dh. vol II 
pp. 385-387 and for the spread of Hinduism in Java, Bali, 
Sumatra, Siam and other countries of South-East Asia, vide H 
of Dh voL IH. PP 934-935. Recently, through the kindness 
of Dr. J. M. Unvala, 1 had an opportunity of reading several 
inscriptions of the 18fch and 19th centuries at the fire temple 
called Jvalaji at Suruhani near Baku, the capital of Eussian 
Azerbaijan, situated on the northern shore of the Caspian sea, 
which were inscribed by Hindu pilgrims or visitors, that begin 
with obeisance toGanesa and in one of which occurs the verse 
quoted below. ^

IV ] Penances far miscellaneous lapses 119 

days Those two verses of Manu occur in Agnipurana (170. 
23-35). Visnu Dh. S. (39.2, 40.2, 415) prescrib3s somewhat 
different penances for sankarlkarana, apatrlkarana or malinl- 
karaniya deeds Vide also the Mit on Ya] IH. 290 for the 
penances prescribed fov these deeds by Yama and Brhaspati. 
About miscellaneous palakas the rule laid down by Manu XI. 209, 
Visnn Dh S 42 2, Yaj. Hr 294 and others is that the penance 
should be prescnbad by the brahmanas after taking into account 
the nature of the deed, the ability of the perpetrator and other 
circumstances of time and place &c. 

Some of the digests prescribe certain times for the perform- 
ance of penance. The first rule is laid down by Harita that 
having done something sinful or improper through trustfulness, 
affection, greed, fear or heedlessness one sbonld resort to pmi- 
fication at once DaksaMsiI 73 also states that all naimtthto and 
kamya matters must be performed as th«.y fall due and no delay 
should be caused. If more than a year is allowed to pass after 
the sin is incurred the penance would have to be double of what 
it otherwise would have been, according to Devala and Manu. 268 " 
ThePr.T. (pp 474, 512 ) quotes a verse from the Vyavahara- 
cintamani *» and an astrological work to the effect that a 
penance or ordeal should not be administered on the 8th or 14th 
MJu of a month, nor should an ordeal or marriage take place on 
a Saturday or Tuesday. The Prayascittendusekhara (p 15) 
says that according to respectable people {hstas) the sankalpa 
(declaration of undergoing a penance) should be made on the 
14th Mft, and the actualrite should be performed on the amnuasya.

the method of performing Krcchra penance It is briefly as 
follows : The sinner desiring to be free of sin quickly should 
stand by day and sit up by night (i e. should take sleep in a 
sitting position and not lie down ), he should speak the truth 
and should not hold conversation with aviari/as (sudras &c\ 
should bathe thrice in the day, should perform marjana (splash- 
ing or sprinkling water on the head and other limbs by means 
of faisas dipped in water after repeating sacred mantras) with 
the three verses 'apohistha* (Bg. X9.1-3), with the verses 
called PavitravatJ and with the eight verses beginning with 
'hiranyavarnahsucayahpavakah'tTai S V. 61.1-8) Thenhe 
should perform the tmpana 27n (satiating with water) with 
thirteen mantras beginning with namah and ending with vamah 
(each respectively containing 6, 4, 4, 13, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 3, 2, 6, 3 
names of deities) This constitutes for him the worship of 
Aditya (the Sun) and he offers oblations of clarified butter with 
these thirteen mantras and, after he passes twelve days in this 
way, on the 13th he offers nine oblations of boiled rice to Agni, 
Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, the Ttioe Deius, 
Brahman, Prajapati, Agni Svistakrt Then he serves dinner 
to brahmanas The Ap. Dh. S H. 6 15.9 states « the general 
rule that in all religious observances one should give dinner to 
brahmanas that are pure (in conduct) and that have studied the 
Veda. The Baud Dh S. (II. I. 85-99) prescribes that m a 
krcchra penance one has to bathe thrice in the day, to lie down 
on the ground (not on a cot &c ), to wear only one piece of 
cloth, to shave one's hair on the head, the moustache and I the 
body and to pare one's nails, and that the same mode is prescribed 
also for women ( sinners ) except the tonsure of the head Mam 
(XL 222-225 ) prescribes that in all penances there is noma mtn 
the mahsvyahrtis every day, the sinner has to practise obnu 
(non-injury to all sentient beings), truthfulness, absence of anger

of certain virtues and rules of conduct called yamas (such as 
bralimacarya, kindliness, forbearance, truthfulness, aJn?hsa &c. ) 
and myomai (such as bath, silence, fasting, purity of body &c.) 
as necessary adjuncts in all penances. The Laugaksjgihya 
(V. 3-11) prescribes the procedure for all penances Yaj. III. 325 
holds that one should, while performing the penance of krcchra 
ot candrayana, bathe thrice daily, recite holy mantras (as stated 
inVas 28.11-15) and should eat balls of rica over which the 
GayattI has been recited. Sankha 272 (18.12-14) also summarises 
the different items that have to be gone through in undergoing a 
penance The Madanaparijata (pp 781-784), Pr. V. (pp 503- 
506), Pr. Sara (pp 21,22 and 200-203), Pr.T. pp. 497-510, 523-524, 
Pr. Mayukha pp. 18-21, Pr. Prakasa (folios 38b to 43b), 
Prayaseittendusekhara (pp. 15 and 88) "and other works provide 
elaborate rules about the procedure of undergoing prayascittas. 
It is not possible nor necessary to set out these in detail here. 
Briefly put, on the day previous to the actual day of commencing 
penance the sinner should pare'his nails, shave his head, bathe 
with clay, cow-dung, holy water &c , drink clarified butter, make 
a declaration of performing the penance indicated by the 
assembly of learned men. On the next day he should bathe, 
perform sraddha, drink paiicagavya, should perform homa, give" 
dalcsina (gold, cows &c.) to the brahman as and feed them." 
Parisara (XL 3) says that at the end of the rite of penance paiica- 
gavya should be taken and one, two, three of four cows should be 
donated respectively by a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaisya and a 
sfldra. Yama (verse 63 ) says that brahmanas should be fed on- 
the performance of a penance and a daksina of one golden masa 
should be given to each brahmana. Jabali says that at the 
beginning and close of all penances the" sinner should offer in 
the smarta fire oblations of clarified butter to the accompani- 
ment of the Vyakrtis, perform sraddha and offer daksma con- 
sisting of a cow or gold. Vide Apararka (p. 1230) and Par. 
M n part 2 p. 195 for Jabali's verses. The Pr Prakasa (folio 
30a) adds that according to the Maharnava the number of' 
vtjvhrli-Fiomas should be 28 or 108.

A few words may be said about the tonsure of the head 
(vaparw, or mundana). The Tai Br (1 5 6.1-a) states™ "The 
Asuras first shaved the hair on the head, then the moustache and 
then the armpits , therefore they went down (or with face down- 
wards) and were defeated, while the gods first shaved the 
armpits, then the moustache and then the hair on the head' 
The Pr Fralrasa quotes this passage in a mutilated form and 
then state3 that vapam is of three kmda, dtnva (of the gods), 
a&ura (of the asm as) and manusa (of men), that the asura 
method is oondemned, that in consecrating the Vedic fires, m 
the i&tis and soma sacrifices.the daiva method is ordained, while 
in prayasoittas, there being no special vidhi, there is an option. 
Tonsure of the head is enjoined on several occasions e. g. the 
Vistiupurana provides 27i 'Tonsure should be carried out at 
Prayaga when on a pilgrimaga, and on the death of one's father or 
mother, one should not in vain (lightly ) tonsure the head'. To 
these occasions may be added penances. The idea seems to have 
been entertained that whatever sin a man commits it becomes 
centered in the hair, as a verse quoted by the Madanaparijata and 
Pr M. states 2 " Q aut- (27 3), Vas. 276 (345), Baud. Dh.S. 
( IL1.98-99 ) and others provide for the tonsure of the hair on the 
head and lips ( except those on the eye-brows, the hair on the 
trunk and the top knot ). Exceptions were introduced to the 
rule about tonsure Daksa 277 forbade tonsure, the offering of 
pmdas and the carrying of a corpse and all funeral rites to

one whose father was alive and to a man whose wife was 
pregnant. But this prohibition did not apply to penances. 
The Band. Dh S already referred to prohibits the tonsure of 
women in penances Angiras 163, Apastaniba-smrti I. 33-34, 
Brhad-YamaIV.16,Vrddha-HaritaIX 386, Parasara IX. 54-55, 
Yama 54-55 provide m that in the case of married women whose 
husbands are alive and in the case of maidens ail their hair 
should be held together and only two finger-breadths of hair 
should be cut off. In the case of widows and ascetics the entire 
head was to be shaved. It was" further provided by PaTasara 
(1X52-54), Sankha(q. by Par. M. H. part I, pp. 290-291) that 
in the case of a king or prince or a learned brahmana tonsure of 
the head should not be insisted upon, but that they should have

of the body (including private parts ). 282 The tonsure is to he 
performed by a barber and yet the sanhalpa is ' vapanam karisye' 
and not 'vapanam karayisye' From Gaut 27.3 (vapanam 
vratam caret) prescribing tonsure in candrayana Haradatta 
and others infer that lapana is unnecessary in krcchra penance 

Baths that are subsidiary to prayascitta are performed with 
ashes, cowdung, clay, water, paflcagavya and water in which 
fat&a grasB has been dipped Manilas that are to be recited at 
the time of hath are laid down in the Linga-purana, the 
Bhavisyapurana and elsewhere. 

There are certain virtues to he cultivated as being common 
to all prayascittas whether secretly or openly undergone ThBjr 
are called yamas and myamas and have been set out above (p 121) 
from Yaj ID. 312-313 Atri (verses 48-49) sets them out somewhat 
differently. Manu IV. 204 (= Atri verse 47 ) refers to yamas and 
niyamas which Medhatithi explains as follows, viz yamas are 
in the nature of prohibitions (e. g. a biahmana should not be 
killed), while myamas consist of what is to be done (such as one 
Bhould always recite the Veda, as in Manu IV. 147). 

While undergoing prayascittas certain rules about food and 
other matters were to he observed. For example, Harlta 313 
prescribes that the person undergoing penance should omit on 
all days masa and masuta pulse, honey, taking food at the house 
of or belonging to others and sexual intercourse, should not 
speak at an improper time, should perform acamana if he speaks 
with women or sudras or those who sto ucchsta Yama ordains 
that one who is undergoing a penance should omit massaging 
the body or head with oil, the chewing of ffim^S/a, applymg 
unguents and every thing else that causes one to feel strengtn 
or sexual passion.

vratam carisyami' (O! Firs, lord of vratasl I shall perform a 
viata) and when finishing a penance one should repeat the 
mantra 'agne vratapate vratam-acarisara tad-asakatn tan-me 
radhi'(01 Fire, lord of vratas; I have performed the vrata, I 
had the strength to do it, may it ha propitious for me &o.' ). 

Prayascittas are of two kinds, praMsa ( undergone openly ) 
and rahasya (undergone secretly). A few words must he said ahout 
the latter. Gaut. ( 24 1-11 ), Vas. ( 25 1-3 ), Manu XI 248-265, 
Yaj. in. 301-305, Vismi Da. S. 55 and other smrtis lay down 
rules about secret prayascittas. Where a man's 2SS sin is not 
known to anyone except himself he may parform secret expia- 
tion. In the case of adultery and in the case of association 
with one guilty of a grave sin, one may still perform a secret 
penance, even though the adultery is known to the adulteress 
ana even though the man guilty of a mahspataka is aware of 
the association. Vas.** 25 2 states the general rule that secret 
penances are meant for those who have consecrated the Vedic 
fires, who are disciplined, old or learned and that the openly 
undergone penances are meant for othera. If such a man is 
himself aware of the proper penance, he should perform it with- 
out going to an assembly (parted ) t but if he is not so aware he 
may consult some knowing parson privately, asking him in a 
general way what the penance for a particular sin may he 
Vas. 25.3 provides that those who are always * intent on 
pranayamas, holy texts, gifts, homos and japa are released from 
ira. Kara XU26 states that those whose sins have not become 
public maybe purified by homo* and mantras. Even women 
and sudrascanpsrformpsnanoe in secret, since, though they 

u»Mrt onYaj ID.300 says, perform expiation by means of 
gifts and prannuamas. Gaut 26 2 and Manu XL M8^£ribe

murder Gaut. ( 24 6 ) prescribes that for the first tan days he 
should subsist on milk alone, on clarified butter for a further 
ten days, on water for another period of ten days, that he should 
partake of the articles specified only ones in the morning, 
should wear wet clothes and should offer every day eight 
symbolic homas with clarified butter, of his hair on the body, 
nails, skin, flesh, blood, muscles, bones and marrow with the 
words 'I offer in the mouth of Daath' added at the end. ro YS] 
IIC301 prescribes that the murderer of a brahmana should fast for 
ten days, should recite the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg 3L19D) 
while submerged in water, donate a cow yielding milk, while 
Visnu prescribes that he should bathe for a month in a flowing 
stream or river, should perform every day 16 pranayatnas, should 
eat only once a day sacrificial food and may then become 
purified. Visna provides that the drinker of sura becomes pure 
by observing the vtata ( as stated ) for brShmana murder and 
reciting AghamaTsana; while the thief of brShmana's gold 
becomes pure by fasting for three days and reciting the sacred 
Gayatrl ten thousand times and one guilty of incest by the 
repeated recital of the hymn beginning with 'sahasrasirsS 
( Bg X 90 }. 

The sages observed that some of the penances mentioned in 
old smrtis were terrible and involved loss of life T^T* 
gradually more humane and easier penances came to K» 
prescribed For example, Harlta 285 states 'brahmanas wM 
have studied dhatmaiastra should prescribe a penance appro- 
priate to the age, the time and the strength of the *»»«» 
( sinner ), the penance being such that he may not lose ins Ida 
and yet may be purified ; one should not prescribe an observance 
that will cause great distress ( to the sinner ) Angn-as also says

IV] Restrictions on severity of penances 12? 

declares : JSS " a brahmana should never practise the parformance 
of a penance in a forest full of thieves, ferocious beasts, 
elephants and other animals through fear of injury to life. The 
body that is the all in all ( i e. the only source ) of ( the observ- 
ance of) dhavmamust be protected with efforts; just as water 
oozes down from the mountain, so dharma springs from the 
body*. 

As times changed easier substitutes (called jnatyamnuyas) 
were found and. prescribed The word pratyamnfiya \va3 used 
in this sense in the A.p. Sr. S. V. 20,18 (yadyanadhyo-gnln- 
adadhita lsaraam-evaikam gam dadyat sa gavam pratyfimnayo 
bhavatitivi]fiayate), 6 309 and San. Sr. S. 14 51.6 and other 
sutras Samvarta a* states that if a sinner is unable to undergo 
the Prajapatya penance, he may donate instead a cow yielding 
milk and if he cannot donate such a cow he may donate the full 
price of such a cow. Parasara » (XII 63-64) provides four 
substitutes for a Prajapatya, penance viz the recital of the 
famous Gayatrl mantra (5g.m. 62 10) ten thousand times or 
ZOO pranayamas, or bathing twelve times in a sacred watery 
P tew after drying the head on each bath, or taking to a journey

or a quarter niska may be given The Caturvimsatimata »3 
provides several pratyamnayas for Prajapatya viz recital of 
Gayatrl ten thousand times, standing in water, gift of a cow to 
a brahmana — these four (including Prajapatya) are equal, as also 
a thousand Uomas with sesame, recitation of the whole samhla 
of the veda, feeding twelve brahmanas, Pavakesti are equal. 
The Caturvimsatimata 29< stated that one should substitute the 
gift of one cow for PrajSpatya penance, of two cows for Santa- 
pana, of three cows for Paraka, Tapta-krcohra and Ati- 
krcchra and eight for Candrgyana The result was that 
from medieval times at least even in the case of mahapatakas 
there was a sliding scale of penances ultimately ending in 
feeding brahmanas or making monetary or other presents to 
them. Por example, the Mifc (on Yaj. m 326) says that in 
the case Si of the twelve years' penance, optionally 360 praja- 
patyas could be performed, each prajapatya extending over 
twelve days, that if a man was unable to undergo this he' 
should donate as many (i. e 360) milch cows, if that was 
impossible he may donate their price or 360 niskasoreven 
half or quarter thereof &c. Yfi]. Ill 309 provides (a lakh of) Jiomas 
With sesame to the accompaniment of the Gayatrl or making 
brahmanas recite the Veda by the gift of sesame. Vas 28 18-19 
(=Atri VI. 7-8) and Visnu Dh S9010 state that by feeding 
seven or five brahmanas on the Full moon of Vaisakha with 
sesame and honey a man becomes free of all sins. These provi-

sions are maintained in almost all medieval works such as the 
Smrtyarthasara pp. 149, 155, Prayascittasara p. 303, Pr. T. 
pp. 517, 541, Pr. Mayukha p. 18 &c The same method is 
followed in penances for lesser periods. It is due to this provi- 
sion in the smrtis that in modern timas men, when on death-bed, 
perform prayascittas for all their sins by donating a cow or 
mora or by monetary presents to priests. 295 " 

Some interesting sidelights are thrown on the prices of 
milch cows, cows and bulls by the medieval writers The Pr. V. 
( p 199 ) statas that the price of a milch cow ( payasvtnt ) was 3 
puranas, that of an ordinary cow ( go ) one purana and that of a 
bull was five puranas. The Pr. T. (pp. 517-18) quotes 
Katyayana to the effect that the price of a cow (go) is 32 pa#as 
and that of a male calf one purana, that a pana ia copper 
weighing 80 rakttkiis or equal to 80 naraiakas ( cmoi ies ), that 16 
panas were equal to one purana (following Bhavisya and 
Matsya puranas), thatbyniska is not meant the one indicated 
byManu (VIH137) but a dinaraniska i. e gold weighing 32 
raktikas. The Prayascittendusekhara p. 7 follows Taj 1365 
and holds that niska is silver equal (in weight) to four $uia7nas 
or a pala. A raktika weighs on an average 1-8 grains; so a 
copper pana of 80 raktikas would weigh about 144 grains. 
Therefore a dhenu was equal to 32 panas ( or two puranas ) i. e. 
about 26 tolas of coppar ( one tola being taken as equal to 180 
grains). Vide H of Dh. vol. m pp.120-121 notes 161 and 162 . 
for information about ancient coins and their weights. There 
appears to be owing to lapse of centuries some difference in the 
views of several writers According to Vijnanesvara four 
suxarws are equal to a silver niska According to the Lllavatl 
21) varatakas are equal to a kakinl, 4 kakinis are equal to a 
pana and a niska is equal to 256 panas

CHAPTER V 
NAMES OF ALL PRAYASCITTAS 

Now all the prayascittas mentioned in the smrtis and dteests 
wdl be arranged in alphabetical order (Sanskrit, transliterated 
into English), excepting mere hymns, fasts, &c. and brief 
explanations and references will be added to each. 

AGHAMARSANA—( The hymn ftg. X 190 1-3 ) 

This is prescribed as a penance for all sins by even the 
most ancient Dharmasastra works such as Gaut 2411 Baud. 
Dh S IV. 219-20, Vas 26 8, Manu XL259-260, Y5] HI 301, 
Visnu Dh S. 55 7, Sankha 18 1-2 and others. They prescribe that 
a v maD recites ( for three da y s » according to Haradatta) the 
Agharmarsana hymn thrice in the day while immersed m water 
for a bath, he is freed from all sins and that this penance is 
equal in sanctification to the bath at the end of the Asvamedha 
sacrifice The Pr. Sara p 199 speaks of the Aghamarsana- 
vrata He has to fast for three days and stand up by day and 
sit up by night and donate a milch cow at the end. Sankha 
18 1-2 and Visnu Dh. S.46.1-9 prescribe the details. 

ATIKECCHRA— Vide under Krcchra Manu XL 213 
prescribes that this penance is constituted by eatmg only one 
morsel of food for three days in the morning only, for three 
days in the evening only, for three days eating one morsel got 
without asking for it and observing a complete fast for the next 
three days Taj III319, on the other hand, prescribes the 
eating or just as much food as would fill the hand (and not 
merely one morsel) The Mit , Pr Sara (p 176) and others 
state that the rule of Manu applies to those who are able to 
undergo it, while that of Yaj is meant for those who are unable 
(asakta) The Samavidhana Br. 12 6-7, Gaut 26.18-19, 
Visnu Dh S 54 30, Laugaksigrhya V.12-13, Parasara XL54-55, 
Vas 24 1-2, Baud Dh S IV 5 8 also speak of this Manu XI 208 
( = Visnu 54 30 ) prescribes this penance for striking a 
brahmana with a weapon or a cudgel Gaut 26 22 states that 
this penance purifies a man of all sins except the viahuputalas 

ATISANTAPANA— Ssb under Maha-satttspana This is 
variously defined According to the Agnipurana 171 10 and Visnu 
Dh S. 46 21 it lasts for 18 days (3 times of the Maha-santapana 
in which for six days one has to subsist on cow's urine and fi\* 



IV ] Atisantapana penance 131 

other things ). The Mit on. Yaj. m 315 quotes a versa of 
Yatna according to which this penance lasts for 12 days. 296 
The Pr. M. (p. 23) speaks of it as lasting for 15 days. 

ARDHAKRCCIfRA— See under Krochra. According to 
the Apastamba-smrti 9 43-44. this is constituted by taking food 
only ones in the day for one day, only ones in the evening for 
one day, taking food for two days without asking for it and 
completely fasting for two days 2 " (in all six days). The Mit. 
quotes another variety of it, viz. subsisting for three days on 
food obtained without asking for it and thereafter observing a 
complete fast for three days. 

A.$VAMEDK£VABHRTHASNA.NA— the ceremonial 
bath in the sea or a holy river at the end of an Asvamedha 
sacrifice. VisnuDh. S. 36 (last verse) prescribes for those 
guilty of mahapatakas and anupatakas the Asvamedha sacrifice. 
It is only an emperor or a crowned king who is entitled to 
perform an Asvamedha, at the end of which comes a ceremonial 
bath. Vide H of Dh. vol. H pp. 1238-1236 for a description of 
the Asvamedha According to Pr. V. p. 65 only a ksatriya could 
perform Asvamedha and so this bath was a penance for him alone. 
But according to Kulluka (on Manu XL 92) and Pr. T. (both 
quoting a verse from Bhavisya-purana ) even a brahmana could 
participate in the bath at the end of the Asvamedha and become 
free from the sin of brahmana murder if committed 
unintentionally. 29 « 

AQNEYA KRCCHRA— According to the Agnipurana and 
Visnudharmottara if a man subsists for twelve days on sesame 
alone that is agneija Krcchra. »» Vide also Pr Pr. (folio 48b.)

132 History of JDhartnaidstra [Vol. 

KSICANDR& TAN A— According to Brhad-Visnu quoted 
by Fr. Prakarana p. 132 this penance requires -that one should 
take only three mouthfuls of sacrificial food every day for a 
month 30D 

EKABHAKTA— According to Fr Fr. (folio 48a) if one 
takes for a month only one meal a day it is ekabhaktaka. 301 

KRCCHRA — This is the general word for several penonce3 
The Sama. Br (1 2 1) starts 3ai by saying 'we shall now expound 
three krcohras ' and adds that one should eat sacrificial food for 
three days only by day and eat nothing at night, then for three 
days more one should eat at night only, then for three more 
days one should not beg or ask for food from others and should 
then observe a complete fast for three days If he is in a hurry 
to purify himself he should pass the day standing and the night 
in a sitting posture. Qaut. (26.2-16) describes the procedure of 
the first Krcchra (called Prajapatya by later writers), then 
Atikrcohra (2618-19), and then Krcohratikrcohra (2620). 
Baud. Dh. S (11.1,91 ) speaks of Paraka as Krcchra. Ap. Dh S 
( L9.27.7 ) describes the Krcchra penance of twelve days. The 
Krcchra penance described by Gaut. 26 2-16 is one for twelve 
days and is called Prajapatya by Manu (XI 211), Sankha 
(18 3), Y5] m 319 and others. Laugaksi Gr. (5 3-11) describes 
Krcchra According to the Par 303 m. (II part 1 p. 30) and 
Pr. Pr, (folio 64a) the word Krcohra without any qualifying 
epithet ( upapada ) means Prajapatya. The Pr. T. ( p 481 ) 
states that the Krcohra described by Gaut. ( 26 1-5 ) is givon 
the name of Prajapatya by Manu (23.211). Besides the rules 
about the intake of food, Gaut. prescribes certain other observ- 
ances viz speaking the truth, not holding conversation with

men and women that are anmyas (not of the three higher 
castes ), always singing the samans called ' Raurava ' and 
' Yaudhajapa ', hathing thrice in the day in the morning, the 
noon and the night, then performing marjana 301 ( sprinkling of 
of water ) with the three verses beginning with ' Apo hi stha * 
( Rg X.9.1-3 ), with the mantras called ' pavitravati ' viz. those 
beginning with ' pavamanah savarjanah ' ( Tai. Br. 1 4 8 1 ) and 
the eight veTses beginning with ' Hiranyavaroah ' ( in Tai. 
S V. 6.1), he shonld perform tarpaya with water with 13 
mantras (Gaut 26.13 ); he performs the worship of Aditya ( the 
sun) with the same mantra (i.e. after taipana with the 13 
mantras, he is to perform the worship of the sun with the same 
thirteen mantras ) and offers oblations of clarified butter with 
the same 13 mantras and then on the 13th day he cooks boiled 
rice and offers oblations into ordinary Agni ('svaba' added at 
the end of each, such as ' agnaye svaha), Soma, Agni and Soma, 
Indra and Agni, Indra, Visve devah, Brahman, Prajapati and 
Agni Svistakrt and then feeds the brahmanas. 

Krcchra-samvatsara— Ap. Dh. S. I 9.27.8 speaks of this as 
a penance in which Krcchras are undergone continuously in a 
cycle for one year. 

, Krcchratikrcchra—Gaut. 26.20 and Sama. Br. I. 2. 8, Vas, 
243 define it as a krcchra where only water is drunk on* those' 
days on which food is allowed and Gaut. 26.23 and Sama. Br. 
12 9 state that this penance frees a man from all sins 3 °s ' Yaj* 
HI. 320 ( = Devala 86, first half ) and Brahmapurana 'q by Pr' 
Pr (folio 40 a) presoribe that in this one has to subsist on 
water alone for 21 days. This difference between the views of 
Y«j on the one hand and of Gaut. on the other is reconciled by 
the digests by saying that the period depands on the capacity of 
the sinner. According to Pr. Pr (folio 46b) and Apararka p. 1238

M. II part 1 p. 179 and Madanaparijata p. 716. According to Maim 
XI 208 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 54.30 ) when a person strikes a 
brahmana with a weapon and draws blood, he has to undergo 
this penance. The Pr, Prakarana ( p IS ) states that for those 
unable to undergo Krcchra, one milch cow is a substitute, for 
Atikrcchra two milch cows and for Krcchratikroohra four. 

GOMUTRA-KRCCHRA—Th.6 Pr. Sara p. 187 quotes a 
verse about this : one should make a cow eat to satiety grains of 
wheat mixed with barley and then may collect the yava~ grains 
that are to be found in her dung and then drink the gruel of 
those yavas cooked in cow's urine. 307 

QOVRATA— Pr. Prakarana (p. 132) quoting the 
Markandeya describes this as follows : One should bathe with 
cow's urine, should subsist on cow-dung, should always stand 
among cows, should sit down on cowdung, should drink water 
only when cows have drunk water ; one should not eat when they 
have not eaten, should stand up when they stand, should sit 
down when they sit down. This should be oontinued for a month. 
CANDRAYANA— The word is derived in this way That 
rite, where there is action by means of increase and decrease 
(in the intake of food) in imitation of the course of the phases 
of the moon, is candrayana *» The word occurs in Pan. V.l. 
72 (parayana-turayana-candrayaDam vartayati) From very 
ancient times CSndrayana has been divided into two varieties, 
called Yavamadhya 3W (lit. being large in the middle like a 
grain of yarn, and therefore tapering or thin at the ends ) and 
Pipllikamadhya (lit. having a middle like that *»«"*._*"* ?|

varieties of Candrayana viz. Yavamadhya, Pipilikamadhya, 
Yahcandrayana, Saroatomukha and £isucandrayuna. These 
will be described later on. Yajnavalkya says (HI. 326) 
that where no specific penance is prescribed in the smrfci 
texts, candrayana effects purification and candrayana may 
be undergone not as a penance but for the purpose of accumu- 
lating merit and that in the latter case (when performed 
for a year) the performer enjoys the happiness of going to the 
world of the moon after death. M1 Manu XI. 221 and Gaut- 
27.18 state the same view about candrayana for accumulating 
merit. When the vrata of candrayana is performed for the sake 
of merit, there is no tonsure (vide Gaut. 27.3 ' vapanam, vratam 
caret' and Haradatta thereon). Gaut. 19.20 ( = Vas. 22. 20 ) 
prescribes that Krcchra, Atikrcchra and Candrayana are the 
same psnancB for all sins ( collectively for grave sins, for lesser 
ones separately, according to Haradatta and others ). Compare 
Manu V 21 and XI. 215 (=Baud. Dh S. IV. 5. 16). Manu XL 27, 
YS]. III. 323, Vas. 27 21, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5.18 and others define 
Candrayana (of the Yavamadhya type ) as follows : On the first 
day of the bright half of a" month only one morsel of food ( grasa 
orpinda) is taken, on the second ttthi two and so on; on the full 
moon (Paurnamasi) 15 morsels are taken ; then on the first of 
the dark half 14 morsels, one being reduced on each succeeding 
day. So on the 14th of the dark half only one morsel is eaten 
and on the Amavasya there is a complete fast. Here in the 
middle of the month of thirty days the largest number of morsels 
is taken ( and so this is Yavamadhya ) just as on the Paurnamasi 
day the moon becomes full and begins to wane from the next day 
Here Paurnamasi is in the middle of the period of the observance 
as Visnu Dh. S. 47.6 says. If one begins the vrata on the first 
Mhi of the dark half, he reduces one morse] on the 1st i. e takes 
14 morsels on that day, 13 on the 2nd tithi of the dark half and 
so on On the 14th of the dark half he eats one morsel and on 
the amavasya he eats nothing. Then on the 1st of the bright

and Maim XL 216. Visnu Dh. S. 47.5-6 say : Yasyamamavasya 
madhye bhavati sa pipllika-madhyah. yasya paumamasl aa 
yavamadhyah. If there are 14 or 16 tithia in any particular 
paksa ( half of a month ) then the number of gt usas must ba 
regulated accordingly There are other descriptions of 
cindrsyana Vide Haradatta on Gaut. 27.12-15. The Kalpataru 
appears to have held ( explaining two verses of Jabala) that on 
the first of the dark half of a month 15 morsels were taken, then 
one morsel less was taken on each succeeding tithi; so that on 
atnavasya one morsel was eaten, then on tbe first of the bright 
half two morsels were eaten and one morsel was added every 
day so that on the 14th of the bright half fifteen morsels were 
taken and there was a complete fast on PaurnamSsl. But this 
seems to be opposed to the very idea of increase and decrease of 
the intake of food on the analogy of the waxing and waning of 
the Moon and; to several smrti texts such as Vas 23.45 and 
Parasara X 2 Thorofore the Pr. PrakSsa ( folio 58b ) finds 
fault with it 311 » Candrayana may be divided from another 
point of view into two varieties : (1) MUKHYA (in the primary 
sense, viz. following exactly the waxing and waning of the 
moon) and GAUNA (having a secondary or metaphorical 
sense). The former is either yavamadhya or pipiltka-iaim- 
madhija ), while the latter is of four kinds, viz. samanya, rsi- 
candrayana, sisucandrayana and yaticandrayana The last 
two will be described later. The Samanya ( or sarvatomukha ) 
consists in eating only 240 morsels of sacrificial food in a month 
of 30 days, distributing them according to one's choice (not 
necessarily in imitation of the phases of the moon ) as stated by 
Manu XI 220, Baud. IV. 5.21, Yaj HI. 324 and the M it (on 
Yaj. IIL 324 ), the Madana-parijata and other works. Here tne 
penance, though it is not regulated by the phases of the moon, 
is called Candrayana for the purpose of prescribing the same 
procedure and observances in it as in the Candrayana wmcfl 
follows the phases of the moon. Here the MImansa rule ox 
Kundapayinam-ayana applies. 3 " Pr om tha wo rds of Gantama

2712-15 it appears that lie envisaged a candrayana of 32 days 
{ piptiikamadhya ) or 31 days, when he says that the performer 
should fast on the 14th of the bright half, eat fifteen morsels on 
the Full Moon day, then reduce it by one morsel, so that there 
is a total fast on the amSvasya and then on the first of the 
bright half one morsel is taken until on the full moon 15 
morsels are taSen. Thus from the 14th of the bright half ( when 
there is a complete fast ) to the fall moon of the succeeding 
month there are inaU 32 days &nd the penance is of the 
protliba-madhya type. 

As regards the size of the morsels, different views are 
expressed. Gaul 27.10 and Visnu Dh. S. 47.2 prescribe that the 
size of a morsel shall be such as not to cause a distortion of the 
month (while swallowing it) Yaj TEL 323 allows that the morsels 
may he as large as the egg of a peahen, and ParasaraX3 3 « 
prescribes the size of a hen's egg and Sankha that of an undried 
amdakt fmit (myrcMan). The Mit explains that Gautama's 
words apply to boys and young people and that the other sizes 
confer an option according to the capacity ( sakti ) of the man 
undergoing penance. The procedure of oandrayana is described

about this penance Manu XI 214, Vas 21 21, Visnu Dh. S 46 
11, Baud DlxS.IV 5.10, Sankha-smrti 18.4, Agnipurana 171 
6-7, Atri verses 122-123, Parasara IV. 7 speak of it as of 13 
days' duration comprising four periods of three days each In 
this one drinks hot water, hot milk, hot ghee for three days each 
and then for three days there is a complete fast when he inhales 
hot vapour or atmosphere ( ace to Manu XL 214) Manu adds 
that the performer has to bathe only once (and not thrice as in 
some other penances ) and that he should practise self-control 
Yaj HT 317 (= Devala 84) speaks of this as of four days' 
duration, viz he takes hot milk, hot ghee and hot water for one 
day each and observes a total fast on the 4th day. The Mit on 
Ysj. HL 317 calls this mahatapta-focchra and also mentions a 
(ap'akrcchra of two days, viz on the first day the sinner takes 
. .: *' e three, vi? hot water, hot milk ar.d hoc ghee and obsrrrf= 
a total fast on the 2nd day. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 50a) 
remarks that the authority for the two days' taptakrcchra spoken

days (vide Mit. on Yaj EL 323). Apararka pp. 1239-1241, Par.

TOYA-KRCCHRA— This is also called Varuna-krccbra by 
Yama (q inPr. Prak&sa, folio 48 a) and by Sankha(q inPr, 
Sara p. 182 ). Visnu Dh S. (46. 14 ) states a8 that subsisting on 
nothing but ground barley mixed with water for one month is 
called Udakakrcchi a. Since Varuna was regarded as the lord of 
waters even from the times of the ftgveda ( e. g. in Bg. YIL 49. 
3 ) and to mark the truth and falsehood among men, this Toya- 
krcchra was called Varuna. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 47 b) 319 quotes 
JabSla to the effect 'If a sinner remains immersed m water for 
a whole day and night without taking food and recites mantras 
( addressed to Varuna ) he removes by the jalalcrcchra the sins 
which he may have committed for a year'. According to Yajfia- 
valkya (q in Pr. Saxap 187) this penance consists in observing 
a fast for a day and night standing up the whole day and passing 
the night without sleep in water and reciting the next day the 
sacred Gayatri mantra 1008 times. According to Sankha (q. by 
Madana-parijata p 737) this penance is constituted either by 
subsisting on lotus stalks giown in water or on saklus boiled 
m water. 

DADHIKRCCB.RA— This is spoken of by the Pr Pralsaisa 
quoting from the Visnudharraottarapurana as a penanoe in 
which the sinner subsists on ourds alone for a month. 320

of only rica gruel, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee 
each for a period of taee days in succession and then should 
observe a complete fast for three days; this is called DevaMa 
(performed by the gods) penance and destroys all sins. It was 
practised by the Maruts, the Vasus, Eudras, and Adityas. By 
the power of this penance they became free from rajas (^purity) 
Thus this penance lasts for 21 days. The Pr. Prakasa ( folio 48 
b ) refers to another variety of it and quotes a long prose passage 
on it, which is passed over here f 01 want of space. 

BBANADAKUCCtiRA— See under Vayavya-krcchra. 
According to the Visuudharmottara 322 (q. by Pr. Prakasa) this 
penance consists in subsisting for a month on food just sufficient 
to fill the extended but hollowed palm, mixed with gold (i. e. in 
which gold is rubbed or boiled). 

NITYOPAVASA KRCQEBA—Vaz Pr. Prakasa (p. 48 a) 
states that this is constituted by a man eating only twice in the 
day ( in the morning and evening ) for six years and not drink- 
ing even water between the two meals. ^ 

PANCAGAVYA—'Sot: the various details connected with 
pancagavija prepared from cow's mine, dung, milk, curds and 
ghee, vide H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 773-774. Paficagavya is to be 
offered into fire with the mantras 'Iravatl' (Eg. VR 99.3), 'idam 
Yisnur" (Eg 132.17), 'ma nastoke' (Eg. 1. 114. 8), 'Sam no 
de-ylr' (Eg. X 9. 4 ) and then the remainder is to be drunk. It 
is to be drunk with the middle of a sprig of three Palasa leaves 
or with a lotus leaf. Manu. XI. 165 ( = Agnipurana 169. 30) 
prescribes this drinking of paficagavya as the penance for petty 
thefts Similarly, Yaj. 3H. 263 prescribes that one guilty of 
killing a cow should drink paficagavya for a month. The 
Mil on Yaj. HI. 263 quotes Visnu to the effect that one 
who kills a cow should perform one of three penances, viz. 
drinking three palas of paficagavya every day for one month 
or undergoing the penance of Paraka or Candrayana. Ni Though

drinking sui a and a sudra drinking paficagavya both went to 
hell (Maharaurava, according to Vismi),yetDevala (verse 61) and 
ParSsara XI 3 and 27 and medieval works like the Pr M. (p 13) 
and Sudrakamalskara (p. 42 ) allowed sudras to take paficagavya 
without Vedio mantias. And women of all varnas, being treated 
like sSdras for certain purposes, were also allowed optionally to 
do the same. 

PATRAKRCCHRA—ViAb Pama-kurca below. 

PARAKA— Mann XL 215 (= Baud. Dh S IV. 5.16), Yaj. 
IH 320 (= Sankha 18 5 = Atri 128), Agnipurana 171, 10, Visnu 
Dh. S. 46. 18 and Br. 32S prescribe that this penance is constituted 
by not taking any food for twelve days, while the performei 
controls his senses and remains vigilant, and that this penance 
removes all sins. 

PARNAKURCA— This is a more severe type of patra- 
krcchra Yaj IH 316 (= Devala 83) and Sankha-Likhita 3! * 
define Parnakrcchra as one where the leaves of palasa, 
udumbara, lotus, and bilva are boiled separately on each day 
in succession and the decoction of each is drunk on each day 
separately and then water in which kuias have been dipped is 
drunk. Thus parnakrcchra is a penance of five days The Mit. 
on Yaj. HI 316 quotes a verse of Yama to the effeot that when a 
sinner fasts for three days and nights and thereafter he drinks 
together the decoctions of all the four and latsa water on the 
same day then the penance is called parnakurca. The Par M 
(II part 2 p 181)3» regards Parnakurca as a variety of Parna- 
krcchra Vasistha, Jabali and Atri (116-117) make Parna- 
kicchia a penance of six days by adding the leaves of Asvattha 
to the five mentioned ahove. Visnu Dh S 46 23 mentions 
another variety of Parnakrcchra for seven days 32B

PARNAKBCCHRA— Vide Parnakurca above. 

P&DAKRCCHRA— According to Yaj. HI. 318 (=Devala 85) 
this is defined as a penance where a sinner takes food one day 
only once by day, only once by night, then once only (by day or 
night) but without asking for it from any one ( a stranger, a 
servant or even his own wife ) and observes a total fast for one 
day. Thus this penance lasts for four days. There was differ- 
ence of view as to the number of mouthfuls to be eaten, 
Xpastaroba (q by Mit. on Yaj. HL 318) saying that the mouth- 
fuls are respectively 23, 26 and 24 when food is taken only once 
in the evening or morning ot without asking for it, while 
Parasara states the number of mouthfuls to be 12, 15 or 24 
respectively when food is taken only at night or in the morning 
or without asking for it The Caturvimsatimata (q. by Par. M. 
II part 2 p. 172) puts them as 12, 15 and 10 respectively 

PADONAKRCCHRA— This lasts for nine days 329 only 
instead of the 12 days of the Prsjapatya and in it one eats by 
day only for three days, eats food once only for three days with- 
out asking for it from any one and observes a complete fast for 
three days ( i. e. three days when food is eaten by night only are 
omitted here). 

PUSPAKRCCHRA— According to the Agnipurana 171 12 
and the Mit. on Yaj El. 316 (quoting Markandeyapurana ) this 
penance is constituted by drinking for a month the decoction of 
flowers boiled in water. 3m

the oldest of the three authors may be set out here w « Now /.

been placed on fire, when it is being boiled and after it has been 
boiled with the following mantras ' thou art barley, the king 
of grains, thou art sacred to Varuna and mixed with honey" 
the sages have declared thee to be an expeller of all sins and a 
means of purification * Then theie are five verses more invoking 
the barley grains to purify the performer from all sins whethei 
due to deeds, words, or thoughts, to destroy distress and evil 
fortune, to free him from the food of gavas (guilds or multitudes 
of men), harlots, sudras, or food offered at sraddhas by persons 
in impurity due to birth or death, food of a thief, food at 
navasraddha (i e on 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7tb, 9th, 11th days after death) 
or from dreadful mortal sins or from guilt against children and 
guilt due to serving in a royal court, from Bin of stealing gold, 
sin of the violation of a viata or sacrificing for an unworthv

As to the rest Harlta agrees closely with Baud while Visnu differs a good

andTai S. HI 4. 11. 2) and 'Brahma devanam* (Rg. IX. 96.6, 
Tai. S HI 4 11,3) "Then having sipped water he should eat 
a little of the boiled food after pouring it into another vessel. 
Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul reciting 'ye deva' (Tai. 
S. 1 3. 3.1)." 

Then Band, prescribes: "one desirous of wisdom must perform 
this rite for three days and nights A sinner who drinks it 
during six days becomes pure, he who drinks this during seven 
days becomes purified from the rnahapatakas, he who drinks 
during eleven days removes even the sins committed by his 
ancestors. But he who during 31 days drinks gruel of barley 
grains which have passed through a cow (i. e. cowdung) sees 
thefltoias.thelordof the Gemots, the goddess of learning and 
the lord of learning."

Vedic texts or without (for women and sudras) 331 

PHALAKRCCHRA— Subsisting on fruits alone for a 
month. f Vide the passage from Markandeya quoted above ( n 
330). Srlkrcchra mentioned below will be also phalakrcchra 
The fruits of Bjlva and of Amalaka and lotus seeds were the 
only fruits to be employed and they were to be eaten only for 
bare subsistence. 

BALAKRCCHRA—See Sisukrcchra 

BRHAD-Y&VAKA— The Pr. Pr. (folio 49 a) quoting 
Brahmapurana describes it as follows —-One should feed cows 
on plenty of yavas anointed with clarified butter Then he 
should mix water with the dung of those cows and take out the 
grains of barley which are voided by them after eating them 
He should then dry them in the sun, should grind them on a 
clean stone and cook them mixed with sesame and anointed 
with ghee in cow's urine on a fire brought on an altar He 
should place the boiled holy grains in a vessel of gold or in a 
cup made of palaia leaves and present them to the gods and 
manes and he may eat them. He should carry this on for twelve, 
twenty-four or thirty-six years for the removal of all sms. This 
is prescribed as a penance for killing one's guru, brother, friend 
or a near relative &c. 

BRAHMAKURCA—The Mit 33S on Yajflavalkya EJ 314 
states that when a man fasts on one day and on the next day 
mixes up the ingredients of paficagavya with Vedic mantias and 
drinks it with mantras it is called Brahmakurca. According to 
Sankha cow's urine is taken with the Gayatrl ( $g. HL 63 10 ), 
cowdung with the mantra 'Gandhadvaram' (Tai. A. XI), mUK 
with 'a pyayasva' (Rg I 91.16), curds with 'dadhikravno' (fe -iv. 
39.6), ghee with 'Tejosi' (Vaj. S. 22. 1) and Kusa water with 
'devasya tva' (Va 3 S. 22 1, Ait. Br. 37.3 &c). Jabala

MAHE^FARA KRCCHRA — Vide Hemadri (on 
Prayascitta) p. 961, which sets out a passage from Devala, that 
states that Brahma prescribed it for Mahesvara on the burning 
of Madana In this penance in the after-noon one should carry a 
hroken jar (kapala) and beg at three houses of learned biahmanas 
for vegetables, offer them to God and eat them and should sleep 
in the evening near an idol After getting up the nest day be 
should donate a cow and drink paScagavya 

. MULAK FCCHR A— Yisnu Dh. S 46 15 3*> states that it 
is so called when one subsists on lotus stalks alone and thB 
Mit. on Yaj HL 316 quotes Markandeya to the effect that one 
must subsist on mulas (edible roots) alone 

MAITRAKRGCHRA— -The Fr. Prakssa (folio »' 53 a) 
mentions it Its peculiarity is that in the Santapana on the 
third day milk of a lapila (tawny) cow is to be partaken of 
The same work notes that the Kalpataru states that this is a 
santapana in which on the first day all the sis ingredients 
(cow's urine &c ) are taken followed by two days of fasting 

YAJNAKRCCJffRA—This is a penance for one day laid 
down by Angiras (q by Pr. Sara p. ] 83, Smrti-muktaphalap 939) 
as follows : The sinner should bathe thrice, should be self- 
controlled and silent: and after the morning bath he should 
recite the sacred Gayatri 100S times together with om and the 
Vyahrtis at the beginning "When reciting he should be in the 
Vlrasana 3i2 posture He should drink cow's milk only once 
either sitting down or standing or curds of cow's milk ( if he 
cannot secure cow's milk) or batter-milk or barley gruel mixed 
with cow's urine (m the absence of milk, curds or butter milk).

YATICINDRaYANA— Maim XI 218 (= Baud Dh. S.

a penance where the sinner eats only eight inoufchfuls of sacri- 
ficial food only once in the noon for a month and exercises 
control over himself. 

- YATISANTAPANA— When the ingredients m of Pafica- 
gavya are mixed together (with kusa water) and drunk for three 
consecutive days it is Yati-santapana according to the Mit. on 
Yaj.TH. 314. The Pr Prakarana p. 128 adds that the three days 
must be followed by a fast for one day. 

YA.MYA. — According to Visnudharmottara-purana quoted 
by Pr. Prakasa (folio 48 b) this consists in subsisting for a 
month on saktu grains found in cowdung. 

YAVAKA— Sankha *« (18.10-11) states that partaking of 
boiled yavas obtained from cowdung for a month is the Yavaka 
penance for destroying all sins. The Par. M. and Pr. Prakasa 
quote a prose passage from Devala, Ms according to which the 
penance may last for seven days, a fortnight or a month and 
^which states that the procedure of Prajapatya will apply to 
this penance.

VAYAVYA-KRGCBRA— AccordingtotheAgnipurana 3 '" 
and Visnudharmottara this penance consists in subsisting for a 
month every day on food that will just fill the extended palm. 

VRDDHAKRCOHRA— VftDDBI-KRCCHRA- This is a 
penance for eight days, according to Sankha-Likhita a9 and 
Yama, in which one takes food only by day for two days, only 
by night for two days, without asking for food for two days and 
fasts for two days 

VYASAKRCCHRA— This is the same as Maitra- 
krcchra, 3S0 for which see above p 148. 

&I&UKRCCHRA— also called Balakrcchra by Sankha- 
Likhita and Padakrcchra by Devala and Frayasoittarmiktavah 
(folio 10 a) and is the same as Laghu-krcohra 3SI It lasts for 
four days, eating once only m the day, eating once only by 
night, eating food got without asking for it only once on one 
day and fast on one day. Vide Vas 23.43 (q by Haradatta on 
Gaut. 36.5), Baud Dh. SHI. 92. Yaj. m 318

month) _ four mouthfuls in the morning and four after sun-set, 
that is Sisu-candrayana (candrayana for boys, old men &c ). 

£lTA KRCOHRA— This is the reverse of Taptakrcchra, as 
here all the articles are to be taken when they are cold 351 ' 1 and 
not hot (as in Tapta-krcohra }. Vide Vismi Dh S 46 12, Agni- 
purana 171 7 and Mit on Yaj. IH. 317 According to Visnu 
quoted by Pr Sara (p. 185) and Madana-parijata (p. 736) this is 
a penance for 10 days (and not for twelve days as the Mit. 
states), viz cold water, cold milk and cold ghee are drunk three 
days each and there is a total fast for one day

purana « 2 171 12 and Mit. on Taj HI. 316 (quoting Markandeya) 
this is constituted by subsisting on Bilva fruit or lotus seeds or 
amalaka fruit for a month. The Madanaparijata (p. 737) quotes 
averse of Sankha to the same effect. 

SANTAPANA— Vide Mahasantapana and Atisantapana 
above It is of five kinds, viz the first for two days, the 2nd 
for seven days, the third for twelve .(Atisantapana), the 4th for 
15 days and the fifth for 21 days. 

SURAGANDRAYANA— The Agnipurana defines it as 
one where somehow or other (and not in a rising or falling scale)

sists in succession upon oilcake alone, foamy scum of boiled 
rioe alone, butter-milk alone, water alone and saktus (barley ) 
alone and on the last day a total fast is observed The Mit , 
MadanaparijSta p 717, Fr Sara p 178 and other digests state 
that one has to partake of the five ingredients in quantities ]ust 
sufficient to keep body and soul together. Jabala (quoted by 
the Mit., Par M. II part % p 183 and others) makes it a penance 
of four days' duration, in the first three of which one partakes 
successively of oilcake, saktus and butter-^milk and observes a , 
fast on the 4th day. Atri (128-129) also mentions it. The 
Pr. Prakasa (quoting Brahmapurtina) speaks 3Si of another 
variety of six days* duration, on the first of which there is a 
complete fast and on the last of which the sinner subsists on 
saktus alone and in the intervening four days he subsists on the 
thick gruel of barley cooked in cow's urine.

CHAPTER VI 

CONSEQUENCES OE NOT UNDERGOING PENANCES 

If a sinner did not undargo a prayascitta, the Smrtis, 
Puranas, medieval digests declared that he had to suffer dire 
and farWiing consequences Yaj. EL 221 declares that men 
addicted to sins, who feel no repentance and who (therefore) 
do not undergo the propeT penances, fall into painful and horri- 
ble hells "Stem 301. 54 ff and Ya]. HI. 206 ff provide that those 
guilty of grave (and other) sins after having passed numbers 
of years m hells andsuf&Tedthe tortures of horrible hells are born 
again in this world because of (the remnants of their) evil 
actions in different forms such as lower animals, insects, trees 
and shrubs &c Manu XI 53 ordains that one should always 
perform penance in order to free oneself from sins, since those 
who have not destroyed their sins (by means of prayaScittas) 
are born again endowed with disgraceful marks (such as having 
bad nails, black teeth &c. ). Manu XL 48 also emphasizes that 
wicked men suffer mal-formations owing to their wicked deeds 
committed in this very life or in a former life. TheVisnu- 
puvana 355 echoes the words of YSj. IH. 221. The Visnudharmo- 
ttara declares 356 that those (sinners) who do not undergo 
penances nor are punished by the king fall into hell and are 
born also as lower animals and even after attaining human 
bodies they become marked (with bodily defects ). Visnu Dh, 
S. (44. 1-10) prescribes^ that evil-doers, having experienced 
the honors of hell pass into animal bodies and that those guilty 
of atipatakas, mahapatakas, anupatakas, upapatakas, jsii-

bhramsa-kara actions, sankarikarana, apatrikarana, malint- 
karana and miscellaneous sins, respectively enter the bodies of 
all plants, of worms (or insects), of birds, of aquatic animals, 
of animals roving in waters, of deer, of cattle, of untouchables 
among men, of miscellaneous and cruel carnivorous animals 
(like tigers). Visnu Dh. S. 45.1 provides 3SS that sinners, after 
having undergone the horrors of hells and after having passtd 
through the bodies of lower animals, are born as human beings 
with certain marks (indicative of their sins) So the teaching 
of these and other authorities comes to this that sins when not 
expiated by penances or by State punishment, lead to hell, that 
then, owing to some remnants of the evil deeds, to birth as lower 
animals and then as decrepit or diseased human being3. 

It is now necessary at this stage to enter upon a historical 
though brief account of the idea of Hell and of its opposite 
Heaven 3S9 There are in the Bgveda hardly any clear or express 
references to Hell In Jtg TL 29.6 the sage prays to the Visve- 
Devas 'save me from the pit, from falling down into it' (tradhvam 
kartad-avapado yajatrah). In Bg IV 5 5 it is said *» that 
those men who are bereft of Ha and saiya, being sinful, create a 
deep place for themselves. In $g. TO. 104.3 the poet calls upon 
Indra and Soma to strike down *t into bottomless darkness 
evil-doers, and in VIL 10411 the poet prays that whatever 
enemy desires to harm the poet by day or night may be deprived 
of his body and progeny and may be hurled below the three 
earths fcidra is implored in $g X. 152.4 by the sage to send 
down into darkness whoever attacks him antfhis people. In M- 
IX. 73 8 Soma is said to throw down in a pit those who do not 
observe Soma's oidinances and who are disliked by him. 1<toi» 
these passages what emerges is that the sages of the ?gved» 
had some faint glimmerings of (or belief in) the idea of _a_d^

SXyavlrahauam). A*afta» may also mean 'one who 
kills a valiant man' but that does not seem to he a proper sense 
in this passage of the Va} S. In the Sat. Br. XT. 6. 1 4 we find ft 
reference to torments of Hell, via. men cutting up the limbs of 
others one by one for crimes committed The Tai. 1 I. 19 
speaks of four irarote called Visarpin, Avisarpin, Yisadin and 
Avisadin in the south-east, south-west, north west and north-sast. 
From the Kathopanisad it appears that at that time there was a 
belief that those foolish men who do not know the Reality and 
who only believe in the existence of the mundane world alone 
have to be horn again and again and fall into the hands of 
Yama 3M (H. 5-6) The same TTpanisad (V. 7) states that after 
the death (of the body) some enter the womb in accordance with 
then actions and knowledge to have an embodied existence, 
while others go into fixed matter (the form of trees and the like). 
But that Upauisad says nothing about the torments of Hell. 
They were therefore probably not believed to exist in those days, 
at least, to the same degree as in the days of the Epics and 
Furanas. The very words at the beginning of the Katha Up. 
Q. 21 'devair-atrapi vicikitsitam') indicate that there were even 
then various views about the fate of the departed The 
Kausitaki Br (XI 3) propounds the remarkable proposition that

just as men in this world eat the (flesh of) beasts, so in the next 
world the beasts eat men. 365 

As regards the opposite idea of svcaga (Heaven) the 
matter is much clearer In certain Rk verses there are said to 
be three heavens (e g Be I 35 6, VUL 5 8.VM.41 9, IX. 
113. 9 ) The generous donor or worshipper is said to occupy 
heaven and to mix among gods; and gods like Mitra and Varuna 
are implored to give the worshipper immortality 366 (Rg 1.135, 
5, V. 63. 2, X 107 2 ) Life in heaven is full of joys and de- 
lights and the denizen of heaven has all his desires fulfilled 
( Rg. IX. 113 10-11 ). 367 In Rg IX 113 8 the poet prays 'make 
me immortal (in heaven) where dwells king Vaivasvata, where 
the sun is confined ( i e. where it never sets ) and where the 
divine waters flow ' A person who neither offers sacrifices to 
gods, nor worships, and observes ordinances other than those of 
Indra is thrown down from Heaven 368 . A sage exultingly 
addresses Soma 'we have drunk soma, we have become immor- 
tal, we have reached Light (Heaven) and we have known the 
gods; what will an enemy or harmful person do to us who have 
been mortals so far?' 369 The pious dead become united in 
Heaven with their Istapui la (merit due to sacrifices and chari- 
table acts) and with their fore-fathers and become endowed 
with a refulgent body (Bg X 14 8 ). Those who practise topas 
or those who perform sacrifices in which the fees ^ run to 
thousands (of cows) reach Heaven (Bg X 154. 1-3) 3 ,and 
Soma, ghee and honey flow for them there. Heaven is said _to 
be the abode of Yama and there resounds the sound of flutes 
and of songs m The Atharvaveda, bei ng more popn lar -

battle was one of happiness in heaven, that there the food and 
material things (such as honey, ghee) that a person required in 
this world were also available in greater perfection and abun-

that the warriors of Vedio times did not believe what the priests 
believed. Iu later times (as in the Bhagavadglta II 37 'hato 
va prapsyasi svargam ' or m the Raghuvamsa VJI 51 ) warriors 
killed in battle were supposed to go to heaven and were privi- 
leged to have the company of beautiful damsels Heaven as a 
plac9 or state of eternal bliss to which the spirits of the reli- 
gious or meritorious people or warriors go, is an idea common to 
most ancient peoples and was probably based on the idea (hat 
the Earth was flat and the sky was a dome carrying various 
celestial objects In the Brhadaranyaka Up (IV 3 33) and 
Tai TTp. (II. 8) it is 377 stated that the joys of the world of gods 
are hundreds of times more delightful than those of the mortal 
world 378 In the Kathopanisad (I 12 ) it is stated by Yama him- 
self that in Heaven there is no fear and no old age, that the 
denizen of Heaven is beyond hunger, thirst and sorrow and is 
in the midst of all delights. The Kausltaki Br Up as quoted 
by Sankaracarya on VedantasQtra 1 1 28 contains the statement 
that the abode of sinners is below this world or ^ the earth. 
The Ghandogya Up in one place remarks 380 'those whose con- 
duct has b9en good will quickly attain some good birth, the 
birth of a brahman a or a ksatriya or vaisya But those whose 
conduct has been evil will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth 
of a dog or a hog or a candala'. 

We have here a complicated blending of two theories The 
original theory of early Vedic times was that of Heaven and Hell 
which is also that of most religions Later on when the doctn- 
nes of to ma and punaijanma came to be universally believed 
in India the theory of Heaven and Hell came to be modified by 
holdin* that the pleasures of heaven and the torments oi tfeii 
both came to an end some time or other and the author of sins 
was born again as an animal or a tree or a human being suffer- 
ing from diseases and defects

IV] Yama in the Veda ' 159 

The fate of the departed soul after the death of the body- 
will be touched upon in the section on Antyesti and Sraddha, 
but in connection with the doctrine of Hell it is necessary' to 
say something about Yama. In Kg. X 58. 1 Yama is called 
Vaivasvafca (son of Vivasvat, the Sun). Yama is at leaafc an 
Indo-Itanian deity. Yama is eulogised in Rg. X. 14. He is 
called a king and is credited with the task of gathering 
together people (X. 14. 1); he is said to have been the first to 
make a way (to Heaven) which was followed by former ancestors 
of mankind (X 14. 2'Yamono gatum prathamo viveda. yaks 
nah purve pitarah pareyuh ')• The soul when departing from 
this world is told that when he follows the paths of the ancient 
ancestors he would see the two kings Yama and VaruDa. In 
Rg. X. 14. 13-15 the priests are asked to press Soma for Yama, 
to offer oblations to him and it is said that yajfia reaches Yama, 
Agni being the messenger. In $g. X. 135. 1 Yama is stated to 
drmkm the company of gods, he is the lord of men. Yams 
owns two dogs each having four eyes who guard the way who 
are the spies of Yama and who move among men and mark their

declared *« 'Tama is indeed Agni and this (earth and altar) is 
Yaml. When a sacrificer strews Osadfos on the Vedi it is 
indeed tantamount to taking up a debt from Yama 3f he (the 
sacrificer) were to go from this world without burning them they 
(Tama's men) might take him to the next world with fetters 
round his neck' In Bg X 14. 103« the pUrs are said to 
enjoy delights in the company of Tama In the Ait Br «&. 
(XH 3) Mrtyu is credited with having fettsrs (pans) and wooden 
maces (sthanu) for catching erring men. It has already been 
seen how Tama is said to have within his powers again and 
again foolish men who believe in the existence of this world 
alone and deny the existence of the next Thus, from being a 
beneficent ruler of the departed souls in the very early Yedic 
time3, Tama came gradually to be looked upon as a dreadful 
punisher of men. 335 The Puranas contain graphic descriptions 
of Tama's abode and of bis assistants, chief among whom is 
Citragupta For example, the Yarahapurana 3sta chap 205 con- 
tains a dialogue between Tama and Citragupta, in which the 
latter recommends the fate that a dead person deserves for his 
actions The Agnipurana chap. 371. 12 states that a sinner falte 
into horrible hells that are declared by Citragupta at the order of 
Tama.

that a man beoomes fit for Naraka if he follows activities 
solely dictated by sensual pleasures. 390 In another place Ap. 
Dh S. affirms that Naraka is indeed one's lot when one trans- 
grosses one's dlutrma. It also states that rewards without end 
are denominated smtgya. The Vedantasutra IE 1.13 makes 
it 391 clear that after enjoying the fruits of one's actions in the 
abode of Yama (Samyamana) evil-doers ascend to this mortal 
world. In Vedantasutra IEL 1.15 the narakas™ 2 are said to be

Avici and (in II. 6 3-5) names 26 narakas. Sankha-Likhita as 
quoted by the Madanaparijata pp 694-695 mentions in detail 
the torments that evil-doers undergo in the hells oalled Kum-

the same in all these works, the variations being due mostly to 
the scribes having read certain letters differently. The 31 
names are generally significant and may be set out from Manu 
as follows: Tamisra (darkness), Andhatamisra (blinding 
darkness), Maharaurava, Raurava (abounding in paths with 
heated surfaces, according to Pr. V. p. 15 ), Kalasutra (like the 
thread on the wheel with which the potter outs off a raw earthen 
pot in two), Mahanaraka, Sanjlvana (where one is made to 
revive and is again killed), Mahavlci (where one is submerged 
in surging waves), Tapana (as burning hot as fire), Sampratapana 
(same as Kumbhlpaka, aooording to Pr. V. p. 15), Sanghata

V. 6.2-5, Skandapurana I, chap. 39 ana VI 226-227. In the 
Markandeyapurana ( chap 12 ) we have a description of several 
narakas like the Raurava, Maharaurava, Asipatravana && 
and chap 14 ( verges 39-94 ) mentions the punishments meted 
out to perpetrators of various sins In the MahahhSrata also 
narakas and the torments thereof are frequently referred 
to For example, Santiparva 321 32 speaks of Vaitaranl and 
Asipatravana, Anusasana ( 23 60-82 ) speaks of the actions that 
lead to hell*(each verse having the refrain tevai mrauargSmtnaVl 
Anusasana 145.10-13. Svargarohanika-parva (2 16-26) describes 
the several horrible sights and torments of such hells as 
' Asipatravana' ( named in verse 23 ) and Kutasfflmah ( named 
in Svargarohanika 3 4). The Vrddha-Harlta-smrti (IK. 167-171) 
mentions almost the same 21 narakas as the Manusmrti does. 
The craze fof multiplying narakas went so far that the 
Brahmapurana, the Visnudharmottara 395 , the Garuda-purana 
and others declared that there were thousands, lakhs and orores 
of narakas. 

The Visnu Dh. S. (46. 23-29) provides that those guilty of 
atipatakas, anupatakas, sankarlkarana, who have not under 
gone prayascittas suffer respectively for one Kalpa, 395 " for one 
Manvantara, for four Yugas, for a thousand years in the 21 
narakas in rotation and the other sinners for many yeara Yama 
quoted by the Madanaparijata p. 696 says that those guilty « 
Mahapatakas stay in Hell with face downwards for a yuga and 
Yama has numerous other verses stating what sinners undergo 
which horrors of Hell. 

Buddhists appear to have borrowed the doctrine about 
hells from Brahmanioal writers Vide Dr B 0. Law's mono- 
graph on 'Heaven and Hell mBuddhist perspective* (1925), pages 
111-113, which refer to eight Mahanirayas and there are other 
-lesser Hells. The eight Mahanirayas are Safijlva, Kalasutta, 
Sanghata, Eoruva, Maharoruva, Tapa, Mahatapa ana ■fl^ioi. 
It will be noticed how those names agree closely with Mann s ii

Bgveda and even in the TJpamsads like Katha ( 1 12-13 and 1» 
• sokatigo modate svargalote ' 1. £g. X 107.2 affirms that those 
who give (Large) dafcsnia stand high in the Heavens ( as stars), 
those that donate horses go in the company of the Sun and those 
that donate gold become immortal. An 5 * echo of this is found 
in Vauaparva 186.9. The Kaus Up 1 3 speaks of several worlds 
(lakas) of the gods such as those of Agni, Vayu, Varuna, 
Aditya, Indra, Prajapati, Brahma and a similar gradation of 
higher worlds is described in Br. Up. HI.6 {such as Devaloka, 
Indraloka, Prajapatiloka, Brahmaloka) The Br. Up. 1.5. 16 
speaks of manusyaloka, pitrloka and devaloka and holds that 
devaloka is the best of all worlds m Kaus. Up. 1. 4 implies 
that in the heavenly world divine nymphs, garlands, collyrium, 
fragrant powder, garments wait upon the fortunate denizens. 
Sankara on Vedanta-sntra (IV, 3 4 ) says that the word ' loka ' 
means ' a place for enjoying the fruits of one's actions ' 
( bhogayatana ) and that Hiranyagarbha is the adhyaksa of 
Brahmaloka (on Vedanta-sutra IV. 310) In the Vanaparva 
( 54. 17-19 ) it is stated that svarga is the place for those who 
die in battle Uowscarga is like and what thB pleasures of heaven 
are is described in Vanaparva, chap. 186.6-7, viz. that there are 
extensive lakes full of golden lotus flowers and fish and devoid 
of mud, that on the hanks of those lakes dwell the meritorious 
honoured by Apsarases who apply fragrant cosmetics to their

todies, wear ornaments and have brilliant golden complexions. 
Similar pleasures enjoyed in the Nandana park are promised in 
Brahmapurana, 225. 5-6. Vanaparva (chap. 261 verses 28-29) 
says that there is one great draw-back in going toheaven,viz. that 
there one simply enjoys the rewards of one's good actions, no new 
merit is accumulated there, one simply subsists on the accumu- 
lated principal or store of merit and that when that store is 
exhausted one has to fall down, the only good point about this 
being that one is born a man and that too in such a way that he 
enjoys 398 happiness. Anusasana (23. 84-102 ) sets out numerous 
actions whereby a man attains heaven ( each verse haying the 
refrain 'te narah svarga-gaminai? ) Similarly, in Brahmapurana 
224. 9-14, 18-25 and 30-37 we have the same refrain. Vide also 
Anusasana chapters 144 (verses 5-15, 19-26, 31-39 ) and 145 
Santi (99. 4-5 ) states that svarga is full of those fallen in 
battle, there are Gandharva damsels there for the brave ( and 
there is hell for the coward ) and that svarga yields all desires 
that one may entertain. The Santiparva ( 192. 8 and 21 ) states 
that svarga was in the North, that ( Santi 191 IS, 193 27) there 
was neither hunger nor thirst nor weariness nor old age nor sin 
( in Heaven ), that good men ( Santi 271. 24 ) are seen as stars 
(or become stars). In the Matsyapnrana (276 17) it is 399 
stated that he who performs BrahmSndadana (one of the 16 
viahadams) reaohes the world of Visnu and delights in the 
company of Apsarases. The Brahmapurana (225. 6-7) assures 
us that a generous donor goes to heaven where he enjoys the best 
pleasures in the company of Apsarases and in the heavenly garden 
called Nandana and when he falls down from heaven he is bom 
as a mortal in a rich and noble family. Vide also Garudapurana 
IL 3.86-S9. It is not necessary to multiply passages. There axe 
two matters to be noted in connection with Heaven and its 
pleasures. One is the calculating or bargaining spirit which 
the smrtis and puranas display viz. make this or that gift and 
then there is so much delight to be enjoyed in heaven, a sort ot 
profit and loss account; and the second is that the lugUess

pleasures of Heaven have a time limit, i. e they are to come to 
attend one day and the meritorious have to he born ; agamm 
mortal bodies. The doctrine was gradually evolved tbaUhere 
is no final release from the cycle of births and deaths bytbe 
performance of meritorious deeds alone 

It is not necessary to set out at length the gruesome 
torments of Sell described in great detail in several smjtis and 
puranas. By way of a sample, the following description taken 
LmaDharmajjastrawork (viz. Visnu Dh.S. 43.3S-45) wril be 
sprite enough. "Sinnere guilty of having committed (one or 
more of the nine kinds of) sins have to endure terrible sufferings 
when they have left this life and reached the path of Yama. 
Being dragged hither and thither by the fierce servants of Yama 
they are led (to hell) by them with frightening gestures. (In 
Hell) they are devoured by doge, jackals, crows, herons, cranes 
and other birds eating raw flesh, by snakes and scorpions that 
have fire in their mouths (i. e. that emit stinging poison). 
They are scorched by fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts 
by saws and oppressed by thirst. They are afflicted with hunger 
and by terrible hordes of tigers and they faint away at every step 
on account of the stinking smell of pus and blood. Desiring to 
secure the food and drink of others they are beaten by the servants 
(of Yama) whose faces are similar to those of such horrible 
animals as crows, herons and cranes. In some places they are 
boiled in oil, in others they are pounded with pestles or 
ground down in iron or stone vessels. In some places they 
(have to ) eat what is vomitted or pus or blood or excrements, 
and hideous meat smelling like pus. In one place they have to 
stay in terrible darkness, and are devoured by horrible worms 
having flames in their mouths. In some places they are over- 
whelmed by oold or have to pass through the midst of unclean 
things and in other places the departed devour each other, thus 
becoming most horrible. In some places they are beaten on 
account of their former deeds and are suspended in other places 
( from trees &c. ) or are struck with heaps of arrows or are cut 
into pieces. In other places they have to tread upon thorns 
and they are encircled by the hoods of serpents, they are tor- 
mented with machines and are dragged by their knees. Their 
backs, heads and necks are fractured, they become terrible 
(to look at), their tbroats being reduced to the size fit for a 
cave shelter and they become unable to bear torments. Sinners 
are being tormented in this way and having suffered intense

pain undergo various further sufferings in their passage through 
animal bodies ( in which they are thereafter born ) " 

That naraka is a place below the earth is frequently stated 
in the Puranas For example, in the Garuda and Brahmlnda 
puranas all Hells such as Raurava are stated to be situated 
below the earth. Vide "Visnupurana 11 6. 1 also. The Bhaga- 
vatapnrana states that Hells are below the earth and above 
water to the south of the three worlds and hang without support, 
in which dwell the troups of pitrs called Agmsualta and 
others. 400 The Agnipurana (371 13-14) avers that the 28 
groups of narakas are below the earth and even below the 7th 
Patala 

We come across Vedic passages such as these 'This sacri- 
ficer who is possessed of the utensils of yajila directly reaches 
Heaven' (Sat. Br. XII 5 2 8 )* M , 'one who desires Heaven 
should offer the DaTsapurDamasa sacrifice', 'one desirous of 
attaining heaven should perform the Jyotistoma sacrifice*. 
What is meant by scat ga or iwraka has given rise to hot discus- 
sions from very ancient times The popular view as rejected 
even in the Vedas, the smrtis and puranas was that svarga was a 
place above the earth and naraka was a place of actual torments 
below the earth Even ancient astronomical works located 
svarga thousands of yojanas above the earth. Parasara, 402 an 
astronomer and a predecessor of Varaha-mihira quoted by 
TJtpala on Br. Sam 1 11, stated 'Bhu (the earth) is 67080 crores 
of yojanas and it is the expanse of the earth; beyond it there is 
impenetrable darkness, in the midst of which there is the golden

V] Ideas about svarga 169 

nountain Mem, 84000 yojanas high and sixteen below and 
hrice as much in length and width, which is called svarga. 
3ut it would be far from the truth to say that all eminent 
raters were agreed on the actual existence of svarga and 
laraka as places. It has already been shown how several 
senturies before Christ Gautama refers to the view of some 
jredecessors of his that naiaka is not a place, but simply means 
ihe loss of the capacity to perform the peculiar actions of one's 
xuna TheTe were others who argued in the same strain. 
Sahara (on Jai IV. 3. 27-38) quotes a Vedic passage where the 
view of the sage appears to be that sacrifices yield the reward 
promised by sruti in the next life and where Kumarila * 03 in his 
brief comment propounds the view that the injunctive passage 
{vidhi) of the "Veda only promises a reward but does not state 
that it follows immediately in this life, that svarga which means 
unsurpassed joy, can happen only in another life. On Jaimini 
VI. 1. 1. Sabara first puts forward the prima facte view that 
svarga «* imports in popular language such things (dravya) as 
fine silken clothes, sandalwood paste, young damsels only 16 
years old and that the word svarga is also popularly applied to 
a particular place where there is neither heat nor cold, neither 
hunger nor thirst, neither distress nor fatigue and where only 
those that have done meritorious deeds can reach and not others. 
Sabara refutes this view and holds that the primary meaning of 
the word si,™ ga is joy «* or delight and not a thing (dravya) 
which brings joy. 

There is a well-known and oft quoted verse which defines 
Bmga as follows: « that happiness which is not mixed up with

pain, which is not immediately afterwards overwhelmed ( by 
pain ) and which is present whenever desired, is denoted by the 
word sixth (or svarga). The Prakarana-pancika of Salika- 
natba, 4 *" one of the early works of the Prabhakara Mlmansa 
school, affirms that in such sentences as 'one desirous of heaven 
should perform the Jyotistoma' the rite is simply commended 
by Vedic passages, which are no more than artliavadas, as a 
means of securing long-enduring happiness which is free from 
the taint of all kinds of sorrow and which is present at the mere 
desire of the enjoyer. The Sgntiparva expressly states 'The 
wise do not regard the other world as directly seen by anyone; 
one has to entertain faith (in the existence of the other world) 
because otherwise one may run counter to the Vedas.' *> 7 The 
Brahmapurana and the Visnupurana speak in the same strain 
as Sahara that svarga is what causes happiness to the mind, that 
naraka is the opposite of it and that meritorious deeds and 
wicked deeds are designated as svarga and naraka respectively 
and that svarga and naraka are really states of the mind 
characterised by happiness and pain respectively.* 08 

One need not wonder at the crude ideas of naraka and 
svmga entertained by most ancient Indian writers and works. 
The same ideas were prevalent among peoples of all religions all 
the world over, ^or example, The Egyptians whose dynastic 
history covers a period of about 5000 years had very remarkable 
beliefs about Heaven and Hell which were illustrated with 
pictorioal representations copiously (as no other nation had 
ever done), although the oldest Books of the Dead .^without 
illustrations of any sort (vide W .V Budges Egyptian 
Heaven and Hell', 1905 p. XI and 2). Sheo] was the name toe 
Hebrews gave to the gloomy abode of the dead m ^elow** 
parts of the earth and it was a land of darkness which was 
appointed as the house for all living (Job 10. Mjj* »» .W

and punishment, while the righteous attain life eternal 
(Matthew 25. 41 and 46, Luke 16.23). The words of the New 
Testament ate plain enough that Heaven was supposed to be 
a place above the earth and the clouds and that Hell was 
a place below the earth full of darkness and torments. Vide 
Luke23.43,JIphesians 13 and 20, IL Cor. 12. 4, Rev. 2. 7; 
and Luke 12.5 and 16.23; U. Peter 2.4 and Rev. 6 8, 20. 13-14. 
Bloomfield in his 'Religion of the Veda' p. 25 1 remarks 'In 
later Hindu times Hell is filled out with the usual gruesome 
stage-setting in the style of Dante's Inferno or the wall paint- 
ing in the campo santo at Pisa*. Even men of genius like 
Shakespeare and most Christian theologians m down even to 
modern times believed in a literal interpretation of passages 
from the Bible which speak of Heaven and Hell as places. It 
is only recently that many Christians have begun to hold that 
the language of the Bible about Heaven and Hell is purely 
symbolical in character 4ta . 



409. Vide William James in 'Varieties of religions experience' p. 264, 
where he says that the fear of the old-fashioned Hell fire was employed by 
Christianity to extract from it fruits for repentance and conversion value

Quranic ideas of Hell, SBE. vol IX p. 317 'Hell is a reward for the out-

drink but only boiling water and pus'. Vide also SBE. vol. VI p 247 (Hell 
contains seven diviswns), vol. VI p. 165 (for the misbeliever is the torment 
of hell fire ), vol. XIV p. 317 and p. 340 (for boiling water, pus and fire) In 
the Quran Heaven was supposed to consist of seven divisions viz Garden of

The Srcrtis had evolved the doctrine, as stated above, that 
if a sinner did not undergo prayascitta, he had to suffer tor- 
ments in hell, thereafter he became born as some insect or lower 
animal or a tree on account of some remnants of his sins and 
that he was born as a human being afflicted with certain

This is infinite bliss to the soul which is purged of self-interest. Heaven is 
also a fellowship of finite spirits " It -will be patent how modern European 
minds have begun to think of Heaven and Hell in terms analogous to those 
in which some of the best minds of India thought of them centuries before and 
after the Christian era In spite of the glowing pictures of the pleasures of 
Heaven and terrifying descriptions of the torments of Hell detailed in many 
of the sacred and popular works in Sanskrit and other Indian languages 
people have gone on committing all sorts of sins. The ancient machinery of 
Heavens and Hells must be deemed to have largely failed of its purpose in 
these days. Large masses of men appear to be slipping into an abyss of 
despair, misery, hardness of heart, wanton brutality and lawlessness 
The lurid accounts of bombings and night raids on big cities, the 
reports of the bloody battles for six years in the World War No 2, the 
harrowing tales of tortures in such prisoners' camps as at Belsen, the 
phenomenal rise in the prices of all necessities of life (food, clothing and 
shelter), frequent strikes and struggles between the employed and the 
industrialists, growing indiscipline, arson, plunder and bestial treatment of 
human beings on the ground of race or religion have produced hardness ox 
heart and debased large masses of Indian people. It is a very difficult 
question for our leaders how to revive among the common peope of India, 
(whom Westerners dubbed mild Hindus) the old characteristics of t°» era « ce ' 
peacefulness. goodwill and respect for human hfe and property, now 
to buildup a new fabric of society, a new civilization and culture on the 
ancient Upanisadic foundations of the pursuit of Reality, brotherhood ot 
man. the unity of allhfe, and love of mankind even without pressing into 
service the ancient and medieval literal conceptions of Heaven and Hell^

iins that have not undergone prayascitta ate, after undergoing 
ihe torments of Hell, born with, bodies marked with certain 
sondemned signs. One guilty of grave sins bears such, signs 
f or seven births, one guilty of upapatalat for five births and one 
jallty of papa, for three births. These marks indicative of their 
having committed a particular sin are observed in each 
ife and only disappear after they repent and perform praya- 
'citta. Similarly, the diseases arising from sinful deeds sub- 
side by adopting the remedies of the recitation of Vedic 
jsxts, worship of gods, homas and gifts.' Verses 6-10 specify 
the diseases that arise in consequence of sins such as leprosy, 
tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, dysentery, kidney trouble, stone in the 
bladder, cough, fistula &c. A man may commit sins of three 
kinds viz. by the body, in -words and mentally (Manu XII 3). 
Really speaking, it is the mind that is the spring of all actions 
(Manu XH 4), but for the sake of convenience, this threefold 
division is made. Coveting another's wealth by unfair means, 
desiring that evil should befall another and persistence in false 
ideas (such as the one that there is no soul, but that the body is 
the soul)-these three are mental sins (Manu XIL 5). Harshness 
of speech, falsehood, backbiting and irrelevant prattling— these 
four are vocal sins (ibid XH. 6). Appropriating to oneself 
another's wealth without his consent, injury to sentient beings 
against the injunctions of sastra, sexual intercourse with 
another's wife— these three are bodily sins ( ibid XH 7). Manu 
provides that bodily sins reduce a man to the state of a fixed 
object (tree &o.), vocal sins reduce him to the state of birds and 
beasts and mental sins to the lowest castes (Cand&la and the 
S HSr" a <\DyPar-M)«* speabs of 18 eYii actiong

or a vena (one born of an Ambastha woman from a vaidehaka) ; 
the thief of gold reaches the state of a worm, an insect (an ant

respectively as a mouse, a camel, a monkey, a plava (duck), a 
crow, a sparrow, bee, vulture, godha (iguana), crane, a man 
suffering from white leprosy, a dog, ch i (cricket bird). The 
Brahraapurana (chap 217 verses 37-110) contains a long dis- 
quisition on the different kinds of animal births that sinners of 
various kinds have to undergo Vide also GarudapurSna 
(Pretakhanda) 2 60-88, Agni 371 30-32 (which latter states 
that the murderer of a brahmana is born as a beast or deer or 
a dog, hog, or camel, the drinker of wine as an ass or pukkasa

p.' 861), Yama (q by Pr. M. p9), Sarikha (q. by the 
Mitaksara on Yaj. HI. 216 ), Smrtyarthasara pp. 99-100 
etate the diseases and bodily defects from which sinners 
suffer after they are born as men. As a sample Yaj. 111. 
209-211 may be cited here; the murderer of a brahman a 
suffers from Tuberculosis, a drinker of sura has black teeth, 
the thief of brahmana's gold has diseased nails, one guilty of 
incest suffers from leprosy; the thief of food suffers from 
dyspepsia, one who stealthily learns without permission (or 
one guilty of plagiarism ) is born dumb, one who mixes up 
inferior corn with superior corn is born with excessive limbs 
( with six fingers &c. ), a backbiter is born with pus in the nose ; 
a thief of oil is born as tilapayi and one who falsely reports 
faults in others has a foetid breath. Yaj. HI. 217 states that 
after reaping the consequences of their ( evil ) deeds (by falling 
into Hell and) by reaching the state of lower animals, sinners 
are horn as human beings of a low order, poor and with con- 
demned marks on the body ; even medical works like the 
Carakasamhita held the belief that diseases were the con- 
sequences of actions done in past lives ( vide Sufcrasthana 
Chap. L 116 ), 

- The smrtis are not in complete agreement about the diseases 
or bodily defects that sinners of various grades suffer. For 
example, though Vas 20 44 and Sankha (q by Mit. on Yaj 
III 216 ) state that the murderer of a brahmana suffers from 
leprosy, Mam .XI .49, Ya] EL 209, Vfenu Dh. S 45. 3, Agni. 
371 32 aver that he suffers from phthisis. For want of space

and deformities from which sinners suffer contained in Sankha

176 History of DliarmasSstra [Vol. 

Although the word Karman is ordinarily employed to 
denote good as well as evil actions still in the section on pen- 
ances the word 'Karman' prominently presents to the mind the 
idea of evil deeds. Hence Karmavipaka means the ripening 
(or fruition) of evil actions or sins This fruition takes three 
forms, as stated in the Yogasutra 415 U 13, viz jatt (birth as a 
worm or animal &o ), ayuh (hfe i. e living for a short period such 
as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell 
&c ) The word Karmavipaka appears to have been known to 
Yaj. HI 131 (vipakah karmanam pretya kesam cid-iha jayate) 
and it occurs frequently in the Puranas (e g in Brahma-purana 
224 41,225 43 and 59, Matsya 115 14 &c). The Pr. Sara pp. 
219-231 contains probably the longest treatment of Karma- 
vipaka The doctrine of Karmavipaka was well known to the 
Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, who in his Ratnavali refers 
to it 416 . The Buddhist Avadanasatakas also refer to the doctrine 
of Karmavipaka. Vide also Suttanipata (S B. B vol 10 part 2) 
p. 38 and S B. E vol 21 p. 130 ( Saddharnia-pundarlka ). In 
some medical works also such as the Haritasamhita it is said 
that the murderer of a brahmana suffers from white leprosy and 
the killer of a cow from black leprosy; a regicide suffers from 
phthisis, and the destroyer of a park from dysentery &c .« . In 
the Vivagasuyam (Vjpakasrutam), which is the 11th anga of the 
Jahia-agama and an edition of which was brought out by Dr. 
P L Vaidya (in 1933) we have stories of persons who suffered 
from evil diseases owing to their committing evil deeds m 
former lives and other stories of the fruits of good deeds.

trouble and which no one might willingly undertake. The 
Mit points out that the description of the diseases (like pthisis) 
is not intended for requiring those who suffer from "them to 
undergo the penances for twelve years or-the like nor for induc- 
ing people to avoid contact with such persons, that sistas do not 
avoid contact with those who have bad nails, that in the case of 
such persons the disease or defect is the last result of what little 
sin remained attached to them and that by the very fact of then- 
having the disease or defect mentioned in the texts they become 
free from the last remnants of their sins and therefore "they do

years, how after their evil deeds have been almost wiped out 
■they become human "beings suffering from various diseases or

> In the Mahavnava-karmavipaka of M&ndhatr it is stated 
that there are two means of destroying the consequences of 
'(evil), actions, viz krcchra (penances) and tbe reversal (or 
remedies) against diseases. 421 . The latter consists in making 
golden images of the sun (as the superintending deity of 
good health ) and of the deity of a disease and offering 
worship to both these in a mandapa on a raised vedilca (plat- 
form). The work expatiates at length on the Vedic verses 
employed according to Asvalayana and the Taittirlya Sakha for 
ghosa-iantt ( propitiatory ceremonies with loud recitation 
of Vedic mantras) ; the worship of the sun with Vedic mantras

CHAPTER VII 

ESCHATOLOGY 

What happens after death to a human being (which is the 
subject matter of Eschatology) has been a great mystery that 
has intrigued and baffled mankind in all ages and was a question 
of vital importance among almost all ancient peoples such as 
the Indians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians. The 
word Eschatology is derived from a Greek term meaning 'last 
things' and is applied to the study of opinions that men have 
held from time to time concerning the future, including such 
matters as the state of man after life on this earth and the end 
of the world. It exercises a great fascination over most people 
and speculation on it can be carried on endlessly. Every 
religion has its own eschatology. There are two aspects of Escha- 
tology; one is concerned with the destiny of the individual 
after death, immortality of the soul, sin and punishment, the 
meaning and content of ' Heaven' and ' Hell '; the other aspect 
of eschatology has relation to the whole universe, its creation, 
destination and renovation, and the ultimate end of all things. 
The first aspect and matters relevant to it from the ancient 
Indian point of view will be dealt with in this section and the 
second aspect of Eschatology is reserved for treatment in a 
later section. In ancient works far more emphasis was laid on 
the first than on the second, while modern men with a more or 
less scientific outlook and attitude are inclined to think more of 
the second aspect. 

Death has been generally looked upon with feelings of awe 
and terroT, though theTe weTe men (often philosophically minded) 
•who looked upon it as a blessing and as a release of the spirit 
from the shackles imposed upon the latter by the body. The 
terror of death was in many cases due not so much to the pain 



180 tUstory of Dharmaiaslra [ Vol. 

caused at the time of death but rather to the mystery that sur- 
rounds what happens after death and to the thoughts about 
what the survivors would have to undergo. It is said by C E. 
Vulliamy in his work 'Immortal man' (p. 2): 'although the idea of 
that life (ghostly life) ranges from the most dismal and horri- 
ble fantasies to the most sublime imaginations, the fundamental 
thought is always the same, the body dies but not the spirit'. 
There were several attitudes adopted by primitive as well as 
civilized people towards death. In the Kathopanisad we read 
(11.20) 'When a man dies there is a doubt, some saying 
that there is survival after the death of the body and some 
denying any survival' and Naciketas requests the dreaded God 
Yama to solve this doubt. There are several beliefs 4 * 2 " even 
among those who hold that there is survival after death. Some 
say that there is a world of the dead to whioh whatever survives" 
goes after death Others believe that the surviving part goes 
to Heaven or Hell according as the man has been virtuous or 
sinful in his life on earth. Others believe in transmigration 
and re-incarnation. Several of the great writers in ancient 
Greece believed in this last doctrine, as Pindar (in second 
Olympian Ode), Plato (in Phaedrus and Timaeus) and Herodotus 
(H 123) indicate. 

The BrahmapurSna (chap. 214 verses 34-39) Sets out the 
persons to whom death is happy and easy and not a source of 
misery and sorrow. Afew may be mentioned here- He whodidnoS 
tell lies, he who did not prove false to affection or friendship, 
who is an ashfa (a believer in God and the life to come), wHo is 
devoted to the worship of gods and the honouring of brahmanas, 
he who does not bear malice to anyone-these have ahappy deatti 
Similarly, the Anusasanaparva of the Mahabharata (chap. 104. 
11-13, chap. 144 49-60) states at length the oauses of prema- 
ture death and of long life. Some of them may be translated 
here. 'Those who are atheists, do not perform the > acts ( or 
sacrifices) proper for tbem, violate the (dictates of) elders ana 
of sastras, who do not know what dharma is and are evil-doers 
are short-lived. Those who have no oharaoter, who always 
break all rules of conduct, who have promiscuous sexual inter- 
course become short-Jived and go to Hell. One who is not 
irritable by temper, speaks the truth, does not cause injury 
tobsings.who bears no malice to any one and who is not 
crooked-th ese live for a hundred years (104. 11-12 and 14 J. 

• Kit. Compare C. E, Vulliamy'? 'Immortal man' (p. 11), 



IV] Signs of Approaching Death 181 

Several works specify the signs indicative df the approach 
of death. The Ssntiparva of the Mahabharata (chap. 318. 
9-17), Davala quoted in the Moksakanda of the Kalpataru 
(pp. 248-250, about 20 verses), the Vayupurana (chap. 19 
verses 1-32 ), the Msrkandeyapurana 43.1-33 ( chap. 40 verses 
1-33, Venkat8svaTa Pressed.), Lingapura.ua ( pur vardha chap. 
91) and other Puranas contain long lists of the signs of approa- 
ching death. It is impossible for want of space to set out in 
detail these signs. But the gist of a few verses is mentioned by 
way of sample. The Santiparva (chap 318) states that a man 
who is not able to see the star of ArundhatI which he could for- 
merly see, nor the pole-star nor the full moon, nor his own reflec- 
tion in another man's eye has only one year to live ; he has only 
a span of six months of life left to him who sees the orb of 
the moon with a hole in it ; a man has only seven days left 
of life who sees a hole pierced in the orb of the Sun, 
who smells the odour of a corpse when fragrant substances are 
near; when the nose and ears bend down, when his teeth and 
eyes become discoloured, when there is loss of consciousness, and. 
loss of bodily heat, when smoke emerges from the crown of the 
head, when the left eye begins to ooze moisture all of a sudden- 
these are indications of the immediate approach of death. 
Davala states indications that prognosticate life for only one 
year, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 months, one month, half a 
month, 12 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days and winds up by saying 
that one who cannot hear the humming sound in his ear (when 
closed with fingers) or cannot see the light in the eye is going 
to die immediately. The Vayupurana (19.28) and Lingapurana 
91.30 regard the last two as the worst indications of approaching 
death * B . The Lingapurana (pfirvabhaga chap. 91.24) states that he 
who cannot see his own reflection in another's eye will not live. 
There is an interesting paper by Dr E.G. Harshe in the Munshi 
Diamond Jubilee volume (pp. 246-268) where the learned writer 
gives the test of two mss. on the prognostications derived from 
dreams e. g. if a man sees an ass in a dream he is sure to die, 
or if he sees an old maid then it is an indication of danger, 
disease and death (p, 251) or if he sees a trident death is 
indicated (p. 254).

182 History of Dharma&uslra IVbL 

When a man is sinking and 5s almost on the point of death 
it was and even now is the practice in many parts of India td- 
take the dying man down from the bedstead and place him on a 
bed spread on the earth 424 . For example, the Kausika-sfitra 
(80 3) prescribes t2S : When the man is losing all strength, he 
(the Bon or other attending relative) spreads laisas on the grass 
growing in the shed and takes him down (from the bed-stead) 
with the mantra 'syonasmai bhava' (mayst thou be good to this 
man, Oh Earth). The Baud P S III 1 18 says that sand should 
be spread on the ground in the sacrificial shed when it is feared 
that the sacrificer is dying and daiblia grass should be strewn on 
the sand with the Bharp ends turned to the south and the dying 
man should be placed thereon and one (son or the like) should - 
repeat in his right ear the anuvalta beginning with 'ayusah 
prsnam santanuV The Gobhilasmrti HL %% and later works like 
the Pitrdayita provide the same procedure. 

Medieval digests like the Suddhiprakasa (pp 151-152) state 
that when a person is moribund, has half closed his eyes and is 
taken down on the ground (from a bad-stead), his son or other 
relative should make him give one or more of tsn gifts viz of 
COWSi as i an ol t sesame, gold, clarified butter, clothes, grain, 
jaggery, silver, salt These gifts are superior even to a sraddha 
performed at Gays or to even hundreds of Airamedhas. The 

424 In Europe a very widespread custom is to take a dying man out 
of bed and to lay him on the earth or on straw Vide Prof Edgerton's very 
exhaustive article on 'the Hour of Death' in Annals of the Bbandarkar O.R. 
Institute, vol. VIII pp 219-249.

or for the removal of all sins'. -After the ten dlXnas, a cow with 
a calf should be donated if possible *» (this cow being called 
ntkranh-dhmu , & cow donated in view of death 1 ) and then 
another cow called VaitaranI with gold (or two pieceB of cloth 
&c) should be donated. The Antyestipaddhati and the Suddhi- 
prakasa (pp. 152-153) set out all the mantras (not vedic) that 
are to he recited at the time of making the several gifts, which 
(mantras) aTe passed over here for want of space, The Antyesti- 
paddhati, the Antyakarmadipaka and other works prescribe that 
When a person ib near death, his son or other relative should 
make him perform Vratodyapana, sarvaprayascitta and the gift 
of ten dSnas or if the dying man is unable to do these himself, 
the son or the other relative should perform these and give the 
merit thereof to the dying man. A person often resolves upon 
observing certain vratas; but fails to carry out all the details of 
those vratas to the end. The Yratodyapana for the dying man 
is meant to cure all such unfinished vratas. The A K. D. (pp. 
3-4) has a long note about the performance of watodyUpaha. 
Briefly it comes to this. The sod or other relative having 
brought about the purity of the dying man's body by a bath or 
by sprinkling it with holy water (mSrjana) or by making him 
drink Ganges water, having himself taken a bath and perform- 
ed his daily duties (of sandhya), having lighted a lamp, 
having bowed to GaDesa and prayed to god Vjsnu, having 
placed before him the materials of worship and having repeated

apart for the purpose and the brahmana should pronounce the 
words "May all vratas he fulfilled I May there he the attain- 
ment of the fruits of udyapana ( accomplishment of vrata ) ". 
In the sarvaprSyascitta the son approaches 4 or 3 learned men 
or one man knowing adhyatma ( metaphysics ) and offers the 
substitutes ( of gold &o. ) for sins that involve penances for 6, 3 
or If years or makes a declaration and performs the prayas- 
citta, after the days of impurity. 

The sarvaprayascitfa was to be performed by the dying 
man or by his son or other relative who was to shave himself, 
take a bath, drink paflcagavya, honour a brahmana with sandal 
paste and other things; after having honoured the cow or the 
money to be paid in lieu of it, and after referring to the several 
kinds of sins that one may he guilty of (vide note *») he is to 
make a gift of a cow (with a calf) to the brahmana or in lieu of 
it, of some money. After sarvaprSyascitta come the ten danas 
stated above. In the danas the Kamastuti «° as studied by the 
followers of each veda was to be recited. The Garudapunua 
(II 4. 7-9 ) further prescribes other danas called mahs-danas 
viz', of sesame, iron, gold, cotton, salt, seven kinds of corn, 
land and cows when a man is dying and also other gifts called 
padadanas such as of umbrella, sandals, ring, water-jar, seat, 
food. The Garudapurana (II 4 37) further Prides Jbat if a

down for what is called aturasannyasa he never returns to the 
cycle of births and deaths. 

Irom ancient times it was a firmly held belief that 
the thoughts that a dying man entertains at the time of 
death determine what will happen to his spirit afteT physical 
death (this is expressed in the well-known words 'ante 
matih sa gatih'), that therefore a man should, when death 
approaches, give up all thoughts of mundane affairs and all 
earthly attachments, should think of his favourite deity. 
(Harior Siva), should inaudibly recite such mantras as 'om 
namo Vasudevaya '. Several texts insist on making the dying 
man listen to holy Vedio texts. The Gautamapitr-inedhasutra 
( 1. 1-S ) prescribes' that one should at the time when one's 
father, mother, brother, teacher or a brahmana friend is on 
his death-bed make the dying man hear the fir3t and last verses 
of the Veda and certain s&mims and should mutteT in the dying 
man's right ear (one saman) The IJgvidhana provides that one 
should repeat at the time of death the sukta beginning with 
HrStaram'* 31 ^) 

The Hir. P. S. 1. 1 provides that when it is thought that the 
akitagni is going to die, he (the son or the like) should mutter' 
in the dying man's ear (if he is a knower of Brahma) the two 
anuoalcas of the Tai. Up. II. l- (beginning with ' brabmavid&pnoti 
param'} and HI. 1 (beginning with 'Bhrgurvai varunih'). The 
A. K. D. (p 18} aays «*i that i{ the dying man fe unab]e ^ engagB

Tho germs of this idea are found even in the Upanisads. 
The Chandogya Up. (in the famous Sandilya-vidya, nr. 14. 1 ) 
remarks 'All this is Brahman. A man should meditate on that 
(all this) as beginning, ending and subsisting in it (Brahman). 
Now man is a creature of his wil] According to whatever is 
his will (or thought) in this world, so will he become after 
departing from this world.' i31 The Prasna Up. UI. 10 contains 
a similar idea. It is here asserted that it is thought power or 
the will that raises the soul higher and higher, and that the 
human mind should try to realize the idea that behind all 
physical transformations the Universe is one and is informed 
by one all-pervading Essence. Similarly, the Bhagavadglta 
puts this idea in a much more clear way. 'The man, who 
remembering me alone in his last moments, departs from this 
life, comes to me , there is no doubt about this' ( 8. 5 ). But 
in order to guard against the possible inference that it 
is only the thoughts at the approach of death that matter 
whatever the past life led by a dying man may have been, 
the next verse emphasizes that a man's spirit is engrossed 
by the thoughts that he has entertained throughout life 
and that a man can think of spiritual matters or about God 
at the time of death only if he has been thinking about 
such matters or about God throughout his life That verse (8.6) 
is 'whichever form (or thing) a man remembers when he leaves 
the body at death, to that alone he goes, having been always 
(throughout his life) engrossed in meditating over it " 

Some of the digests, on the authority of several PurSnas, 
prescribe that the dying man should be taken, if possible, near 
a holy place (tiitlta) such as the Ganges, for example, the 
Suddhitattva«* (p 299) quotes a passage from the Kurmapurana 
to this effect 'a man attains mohsa (final release from samsara) 
by dying in the waters of the Ganges, on land or in wateT at

VaranasI (Benares) and at the confluence of the Ganges with 
the sea either on land, in water or in the air.' Another passage 
to the same effect is quoted from, the 'Skanda-purana and it is 
further said in the same Purana that for one gavyvti from the 
banks of the Ganges is a k$etra (holy place) : 'gifts, japa. (mut- 
tering of sacred texts), koma performed within this extent is 
equal to doing the same on the Ganges itself , those who die 
within this Jcsetra go to heaven and are not born again.' In the 
Pnjaratnakara *» it i s sa id : 'Hari is present wherever there is 
the Salagrama stone; one dying near a Salagrama stone reaches 
the highest abode of Visnu'. It was said that a peTson (even a 
non- Aryan) dying within one krosa of a Salagrama reaches 
Vaikuntha (world of Visnu) Similarly, one dying in a garden 
of tula&i (Basil) plants or with TulasI leaf placed in his mouth at 
the time of death attains moksa even if guilty of crores of sins. 
These aTe popular notions held even up to this day among 
common people, not thoroughly affected by modern ideas. 

There are also dicta about the time when it is best to die. 
The Santiparva of the Mahabharata states "he who dies 
after the sun has gone to the northern direction (i. e. 
when the apparent motion of the sun towards the north 
begins ) and on any auspicious naksatra and muhurta 
is really one who has a store of merit ( with him ) * a6 . This 
is based on the ideas of death in Uttarayana and Dak^ayana 
found in the Upanisads. For example, the Chandogya Up. 
(IV. 15. 5-6 ) states 'Now ( if one who knows this dies ) whe- 
ther people perform obsequies for him or not he goes to light 
( arcts ), from light to day, from day to the bright half of the 
moon, from thence to the six months during which the sun 
goes to the north, from the months to the yeaT, from the

lightning. There is a person who is not human that leads them 
to Brahman. This is the path of the Devas, the path that 
leads to Brahman. Those who proceed on that path do not 
return to the life of man, yes, tliey do not return'. There is a 
similar passage in Chandogya Up. V. 10. 1-2 where it is said 
that even householders who know the doctrine of the five firea 
( Paficagni-mdiju ) and those who in the forest follow the path 
of faith and austerities (i, e. oanapi asllias and partvrajakas 
who do not yet know Highest Brahman ) go by the path called 
Devayana, while ( V. 10. 3-7 ) those, who, living in a village, 
practise . sacrifices, works of public utility and alms, go 
to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the dark half of 
the moon, from thence to the six months when the sun goes 
to the south, from thence to the worlds of the fathers, from 
thence to ether (akaia) and to the moon, where they consume their 
works and return again the way they came. The Chan Up. 
( V. 10. 8 ) refers to a third place where small creatures 
( like flies, worms &c. ) are continually going and returning. 
The Br. Up. ( VI 2. 15-16 ) contains similar passages about 
Devaloka, Pitrloka and the third world of worms, birds and 
creeping beings. The Bhagavadglta, basing itself on these 
Upanisad passages, puts the matter succinctly (in 8 23-25 ) 
as follows: — 'I shall state the times at which devotees 
departing from this world go, never to return or to return. 
The fire, the flame, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months 
of the northern (apparent) motion of the sun; departing from 
the world in these those who know the Brahman go to Brahman. 
Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern 
(apparent) motion of the sun; dying m these the devotee goes 
to the lunar light and returns. These two paths, bright and 
dark* are deemed to be eternal m this world. By the one a man 
goes never to return, by the other he comes back'. The Vedanta- 
suka (IV. 3 4-«) explains that the words 'light* 'day' and 
others are not to be taken in their literal sense (i. e. as signposts 
or stages on the paths) but they are to be understood as referr- 
ing to superintending deities that help the spirits and lead them 
on the path to the worlds of the Devas or of Pitrs (i e. they are 
mvaiukas and abhimanideoatas). Sankara on Vedantasutra IV. 
%. 30 (atascayanepi daksine) explains that the waiting for the 
-day of UttarSyana on the part of Bhlsma (narrated in the 
Mahabharata) is only meant as a eulogy of the path called 
-'areiradi', that one who has realized Brahma, even if he dies 
' jn daksinayana, does secure the frmts of his knowledge (viz.

teaching Brahma), that Bhlstna waited for the beginning of 
vital at/am to abide by popular ideas and practices and to show 
that he possessed the power to depart from the world at his 
will owing to the boon conferred on him by his father. The 
Yajfiavalkya-smrfci refers to the path (devayana) 437 that leads 
to Devaloka (in IH 193-194, where it reads 'manasah' for 
'amSnavah* of the Oh. Up.) and the Pitryana ( in Hi, 195-196 ). 
In spite of the interpretations of the Vedantasutra (and of 
Sankara) the popular belief that death in Uttarayana is best 
persisted and still persists. For example, the Baud. P.S.(TL7. 21 ) 
remarks '(the sages) provide that death during the northern 
path of the sun, in the bright half of a month, during the 
day and at the end of a Srauta sacrifice is best, 438 .' The G. P. 
S. (U. 7.1-2) remarks : 'It is desirable to avoid dying in the dark 
-half of a-month or at night and the following sutras provide for 
the offering of certain oblations if the death occurs in the dark 
half or at night.

437. The words ■devayana' and 'pitryana' are a legacy from the hoary 
past. Even in the Rg. there are frequent references to them. In Rg III. 
58 5 the Asvins are addressed a prayer 'may you come here (to this sacriace) 
by the paths leading to the abode of the gods' (eha yatam pathibhirdBva-

go by the devayana paths' (trpta yatam patMbhir-flevayanaih). In Rg_ VII* 
76.2 (addressed to Usas) the sage Vasistba exclaims that he has seen the 
Devayana paths when the dawn shone m the East (pra me pantba devayana 
adrsran). Agni ,s asked to make the devayana paths easily accessible and 
Jo carry the offerings in a pleased mood (Rg. X 51.5, sugiu pathah krnuhi 
devayanan vaha havyani sumanasyaminah) Rg. X 98 U describes A„ni 
as knowing the devayana paths according to the seasons and a prayer is 
offered to him to place Aulana (son of Santanu) in heaven among the ™ds 
(vidvan patha rtuso devay5 n 5n-apyanl 5 nam divi devesu dhehi). In Rg. 
X 18.1 it is stated that the path of Death is d,fferent from devayana (param

for women also (Asv gr 1 15.12, X 16 6, L 17-11, Manu 11 66) 
but without Vedic mantras (except in marriage) and for siidras 
also (Manu X. 127, Yaj 1 10) but without Vedic mantras. The 
Baud. P. S. nr. 1.4 states that there are two samskaras of every 
human being and they are like a debt i e. they mast be per- 
formed, just as a debt must be discharged viz tbe samskara on 
birth and the one on death (mrtasamskara). Funeral rites and 
rites after death varied according as the deceased was an 
Shitagni (one who had consecrated the srauta fires) or one who 
•had only kindled the smarta fire, or one who had neither the 
srauta fires nor the smarta fire, or a woman, a child, an ascetic 
(partvraja&a), or one dying in a distant land or one dying by 
accident or committing suicide &c. The srauta and grhya- 
sfitras differ among themselves in many details even on the same 
topic and the procedure becomes more elaborate in medieval and 
later times. It would be impossible to state all the differences 
on each topic in this section. A separate volume would have to 
be written for the purpose of setting out all the variations and- 
additions from ancient times to modern times, to discuss why 
and how they arose or were made, to compare the various sutras 
and to compare these again with the puranas and medieval

Before setting out the rites of cremation contained in the 
Srauta sutras, Grhya sutras and later works, it would be best 
to give here a translation of the five hymns from the B,g. ( X 
14-18 ) **°. The verses in these hymns are employed by most 
of the sutras and are used even now in the cremation rites and 
most of them occur in the other Vedic Sarhhitas. Varying 
interpretations have been given of some of these stanzas by 
Indian and Western commentators and critics ODly a few of 
these have been mentioned in the notes. Besides some stanzas 
are employed for different details of the cremation rites by the 
different sutras All such differences cannot be set out for 
want of space. The five hymns are so placed that they follow • 
the order of the stages in which the funeral ritual proceeded in 
fact and is performed even now to a great extent. Vide

453 This is rather a very obscure stanza The A. V. reads pavate 
for ■patat. 1 . 'Tnkadruka' occurs frequently in connection with Soma {as in 
Rg 1122 1; VIII 92.21). SSyana explains that tor the performance of 
Tnkadruka sacrifices Yama gives protection and that he comes to the six 
wide ones for supervising over what was done or not done Tnestx are 
mentioned in Sat Br I.S 1.22 as fire, earth, water, wind, day and night

X. 17. The verses of this hymn, except 3-6, have hardly 
any bearing on funeral rites. Therefore only those four verses 
are translated here. The first two verses refer to the marriage 
of Vivasvat with the daughter of Tvastr and to the legend of. 
the birth of Yama and YamI from Vivasvat. Both are explained at 
length in Nir. XII. 10-11. Verses 467 7-9 which contain prayers to 
SarasvatI are almost the same as A. V. 18. 1. 41-43 and aje 
employed by the Kausika-sutra (81.39) in the cremation rite 
along with A. V. 7.68 1-2 and 18 3.25. 

3. May the all-knowing Pusan, who does not allow cattle 
to perish and who protects the world, discharge ( despatoh ) you

over to these pitas and may Agni hand you over to the gods 
that know you well ! 4. " May Pusan, who is the life of the 
Universe and who is himself life, protect you 1 May ha who is 
ahead of you guard you on the way ( to heaven ) I May god 
Savitr place you in that place where the doers of good deeds 
went and dwell 5. Pusan knows all these quarters in order ; 
may he take us by ( a path ) most free from danger ! He is the 
bestower of happiness, full of refulgence, he has all heroes with 
him ; may he (Pusan ) the wise one go in front of us without 
committing a mistake! 6 Pusan exists ( stands ) in the fore- 
front of the paths (leading to the world of pitrs ), of the paths 
leading to heaven and of the paths on the earth He stands 
facing both the worldB that are very dear (to all) and he, the 
knowing one, travels towards and away from both.

It should be noted that the word 'pitr-yajna' actually occurs 

in Eg. X 16. 10. What does it mean? It has to be remembered 

that°the hymns Eg. X. 15-18 refer to rites immediately on 

the death of a single person. They are not concerned with rites 

performed for deceased male ancestors long after their deaths- 

The anxiety (in X. 15-18) seems to be to make the ancient pitrs 

(styled Barhisadah and Agnisvattah in Eg. X. 15. 3-4, 11 ) 

favourably disposed to the recently departed spirit. Havis 

(sacrifical food such as boiled rice) was offered to the ancient 

pitrs (Eg. X 15. 11) who were supposed to have partaken of the 

food offered (X. 15. 12). The purpose of these Egvedic hymns is 

entirely different from the purpose of the mantras in Tai. S. I r 

8.5 (which refer 'to the pitryajna performed in Sakamedha). 

As a matter of fact three of the mantras in Tai. S. 1. 8. 5 do 

occur in Eg. X 57. 3-5 and are employed in the pinda-pitryajna. 

There is hardly any reason to suppose that the pitryajBa in 

Eg. X 15. 10 is more ancient than the pindapitryajna. It 

is quite possible that both referring as they do to different 

matters were coeval. 

477. X. 18. 12. This is recited after the bones are covered with 
particles o£ dust. It is probable that the particles were poetically described 
as posts. 

47S. X IS 13. It looks very likely that a wooden post was employed 
as a support (or the urn that was deposited under ground. 

473. X. IS. 14. This verse is rather obscure and various interpreta- 
tions have been proposed by German scholars {Roth, Grassmann, Ludwig, 
GelSner and Oldenberg] and others like Whitney and Hopkins The trans- 
lation is only tentative, but it probably brings ont the sense in the context 
ranch better than many other interpretations. The idea probably is that the 
speaker wants to disconnect himself from the dead jnst as a feather may 
become loosened from an arrow that is shot and therefore he states that he 
wants to stop addressing the dead and close up alt connection with the dead.

202 History of Dliarmaiastra [ Vol. 

It would be interesting to see how the ceremonies on the 

death of an ahitagni are described in the srauta and grhyo 

sutras. The J.sv. 6r. S. VX 10 describes what is to be done in 

case one that has undergone a diksa (initiation) for a Soma 

.sacrifice or a sattra dies before the sacrifice is finished. It states 

"When the dtksita is dead, they take out the body by the 

th tfia, 4M place it on the spot where it was intended that avabhrtha 

(bath at the end of a soma or sattra sacrifice) was to be taken and 

deck the body with the decorations that ordinarily are placed on 

a dead body. They cut the hair (on the head) of the corpse, the 

hair on the lips, the hair on the body and also pare the nails. 

They apply paste of Nalada (Indian spikenard) to the corpse 

and throw on it a garland of naladas. Some (having cut open 

the entrails) take out the fecal matter from them and fill 

them with prsadajya ( when clarified butter is mixed with curds 

it is so called ). They cut off a portion as wide as the foot of 

the corpse from a new ( unworn ) garment and cover the dead 

body with it in such a way that the fringe is towards the west 

(the head being placed towards the east) and the feet of the 

corpse are exposed to view. The portion cut off from the piece 

of, cloth is taken by the sons and the like. The deceased man's 

srauta fires are placed on the churning sticks. ( the two warns ), 

the dead body is taken outside the vedi (fire altar) towards its 

south, fire is produced by attrition and then the body is burnt 

therewith. After returning from the cremation, they should 

finish the work of the day. On the next morning, the recitation 

tf the fibrins, the singing of the stotras and the samstavas 

(reciting hymns in chorus) should be without repetrtion and 

the uttaring of the him sound. On the same day "^ *f™* 

upthegm/zos (cups), the priests come out by the totha,go

204 Histouj of Dhaimasasba [Vol. 

S. 25.7 does the same but more briefly. Kat. ( 25. 7. 18 ) refers 
to the cutting of hair and nails and taking out fecal matter and 
Kaus. ( 80. 13-16 ), San. Sr. 4. 14 4-5 also speak of the cutting 
of hair, of bathing the dead body, applying paste and putting 
garlands. The Baud. P. S (1 2) refers to these and adds that 
if they cut open his entrails from the right side they again sew 
it with darbha grass or they may simply wash the body 
( without taking out the fecal matter ), cover the body with a 
piece of cloth, deck it, remove the body by the way between the 
tedt and utkara, place it on a couch ( asandi ) over which a 
black antelope skin was spread with the head to the south, put 
Nalada garland on it and cover it with an unworn piece of cloth 
( as in -5.SV. gr. above ). Sat Sr. 28 1. 22 and G. P. S. 1. 10-14 
contain similar provisions adding that the toes of the feet and 
thumbs of the corpse are tied with a white thread or the fringe 
of a garment (baddhva dasenangusthau-pSdayoh panyosca, 
G. P. S. 1 12 ) and that the asandi ( a small couch or chair on 
which the corpse was carried ) was to be of udumbara wood. 
The Kausikasutra (80. 3. 3-45) refers to numerous stanzas from 
A V. that are to be recited in kindling the funeral fire and 
offering oblations, viz. 18. 2. 4 and 36, 18. 3. 4; 18. 1. 49-50, 58; 
18 1. 41-43; 7. 68 1-2; 18. 3. 25; 18. 2 4-18 (omitting 18.2.10); 
18.4.1-15 &c. Compare SBE vol. XI p. XLI for Budhist practice

while engaged in a Soma or other sacrifice. The JLsv. gr. re- 
marks 'when an ahilagni dies, one (a son or other relative) should 
arrange to have a piece of laud dog up to the south-east or 
south-west at a place sloping towards the south or south-east, 
or according to some towards the south-west. The piece of land 
dug up should be of the length of a man with upraised arms, of 
the breadth of one vyamdF 3 and one wtash (twelve finger breadths) 
in depth. The cemetery (smasana) should 484 be free (open) on 
all Bides. It should abound in herbs, but plants with thorns and 
with milky juice (should be dug out) as stated before (in My.

for that (kind of) cemetery where (the body) is to be burnt. They 
should cut off the hair on the head, the lips and the body and 
pare the nails (of the deceased); this has been declared already 
(in Asv. Sr. VI. 10.2). They should make provision for plenty 
of sacrificial grass and clarified butter. In this (funeral rite) 
they pour clarifie d butter into curds. This is the pr&adajya used

to the cremation ground and held by a person to the north of the ground 
while the rites go on and that it is brought back to the house and kept raised 
at the house. The ground is measured and pegs of pala&, sami, varaaa and a 
stone are driven into the gronnd from the east, north, west and south in 
order. The Sat. Br. XIII. 8. 4. 1 mentions pegs (s«„S«). San, Sr. (IV. 14, 
6-9) states that the ground of cremation slopes to the south or south-east, 
that the ground is swept with a palasa branch with the verse 'apeta' (Re X 
14. 9). then it is cleared with the sfihya and sprinkled with water and the 
pile of wood is made to face south-east.

sacred fires and his sacrificial vessels in that direction (viz. 
where the ground is dug up for cremation). After these aged 
persons, in odd numbers, men and women not going together, 
oarry the dead body. Some say that (the dead body) should be' 
carried in a cart with a seat drawn 485 by oxen. Some prescribe 
that a she-animal, either a cow 486 or a she-goat, of one colour or 
of a dark colour (should be taken to the cemetery). The {rela- 
tives of the dead) tie (a rope) to the left fore-foot and lead it 
behind (the corpse). Then follow the relations (of the deceased) 
with their yajnopavltas brought low (round their body) and 
with the top knot untied ( dishevelled ), the older ones going 
first, the younger ones last. Having thus arrived at thB spot 
(of cremation), the performer (of cremation rites) while 
walking three times round the spot ( for cremation ) with his 
left side turned towards it, sprinkles water on it with a 
saml twig with the verse 'apeta vita vi ca sarpatatah' (Eg. X 
H. 9). To the south-east on a slightly raised corner (of the 
spot for cremation ), he ( son or the like ) places the Ahavanlya 
fire, to the north-west the Garhapatya fire and to the south-west 
the Daksina fire. Then a person that knows (how to prepare a 
funeral pile ) collects a pile of fuel between the fires (on the 
dug-upapot). Then the performer of the rites spreads baths 
(kusas) and a black antelope skin with the hairy part outside 
on the pile, ( the relatives ) place the dead body thereon carry-

varnas) lie down (on the pile) to the north of the dead body, 
"and also place his how to the north if (the deceased -was) ' 
ksatriya. The wife's brother-in-law 487 (husband's brother) 
or a representative of the husband or a pupil (of the deceased) 
ot an old servant (slave) should make her rise (from the pile ) 
with the mantra 'udlrsva naryabhi jlvalokam' (]$g. X. 18. 8); 
the performer {of the rites) should mutter this verse if a sudra 
(•servant) makes her rise and he takes away the bow with the 
versa 'dhanur-hastadadadano' (B-g. X. 18. 9). It has been 
atated ( above what is to be done ) in case a sudra (should per- 
form this act ). Having strung the bow he should before the 
piling up of the things (mentioned below on the dead body ) is 
done, break the bow to pieces and throw it on the pile. 488 He 
then should put the following sacrificial implements (on the 
dead body) viz. into the right hand the spoon called Juhii, in 
the left hand the spoon TJpabhrt, on his right side the Sphya 
(wooden sword), on his left side the Agnihotrahavanl (the ladle 
with which the Agnihotra offerings were offered into fire), on 
his chest, head and teeth respectively the dhruva (the big 
sacrificial ladle), the dishes (or the kapalas), the pressing

on the thighs the two aranis (wood sticks for kindling fire by 
attrition) and on the spanks the mortar and pestle, on the feet 
the winnowing baskets (surpa) or if there ba one only, by tear- 
ing it in two pieces. Those of the sacrificial implements whioh 
have a hollow (into which a fluid can be poured) are filled 
with Pfsadajya. The son (of the deceased) should take the 
upper and the lower mill-stones for himself and the implements 
made of oopper, iron and earthenware m . 

The Sat. Br. XIL 5. 2. 14 first states that saorifioial imple- 
ments made of stone or earthenware should be donated to a 
brahmana but people regard the latter as a corpse-bearer ( and 
so) they should be thrown into water. 491 Taking out the 
omentum ( vaps. ) of the Anustaranl she-animal he should oover 
therewith the head and the mouth ( of the deceased ) with the 
verse 'Agner varma' (Rg. X. 16. 7). Taking out the two 
kidneys (vrkkau) of the animal he should deposit them into the

ments about the sacrificial implements made here and id the Sat Br. XII. 
5. 2, Sat Sr. 28. 2 23-50, Ifit Sr 25 7 21-33, Kaus. 81 1-19, Baud. 
P. S. I. 8 11-1. 9 7, San Sr. IV 14. 18-36. For example, the San Sr. 
(IV. 16 21-31) prescribes that the Agnibotrahavam is placed on the tbroit 
and the two aranis on the private parts, while Asv. gr. places the agniholra- 
havani on the left side and the samya on private parts Sahara quotes 
several times a passage which says ' They burn the ahitagm with bis (vcdle) 
fires and sacrificial implements' (ahitagnim-agmbhir dafaanti yajnapstraisca) 
on Jai IV 1 9, VI, 6 34, XI 3.34 Those words occur also in Baud P. S. 
Ill 1.9 Jai XI 3 34 states the proposition that the cremation ol the sacrl- 
ficer with the sacrificial implements is what is called pralipatttkarman ( the 
final disposal) ol the yajnapatras.

, hands ( of the deceased ) the right kidney in the right hand and 
left kidney in the left with the mantra 'ati drava' (JJg X 14, 10, 
recited once only ). He puts the heart ( of the animal ) on his 
heart and according to some also two lamps of flour ( of rice or 
barley); according to others only if there are no kidneys. 492 
Having deposited the whole animallimb by limb (on corres- 
ponding limbs of the dead body ) and having covered it with its 
own hide he recites when the Pranlta water is being carried 
forward, by way of invocation the mantra 'imam agne' (Jig. 
X. 16. 8 ). Bending his left knee he should offer into the 
Daksina fire oblations of clarified butter with the formula 'to 
Agni svaha! To Soma svaha! To the world svaha! To Anumati 
svaha 1 ' A. fifth oblation ( is to be offered } on the chest of the 
deceased with the formula 'from this one, indeed thou hast 
been born 1 May he now be born out of thee, N. N.I To the 
heavenly world, svaha' ( Vaj S. 35. %Z ). He gives the order 
' Light the fire together." Then the Asv. gr. ( IV. 4. 2-5 ) states 
what one has to understand if the Ahavanvya or Garhapatya or 
Daksina fire reaches the dead body first or if all the fires reach 
the body at the same moment; while the body is burning he 
recites over it the same tests ( $g. X. 14. 7 and others quoted 
above in n. 481 from Ssv.Sr. sutra). Being cremated by a 
person who knows this he goes to the heavenly world together 
with the smoke (of the funeral pile)— thus it is known (in the 
Srati). After he has. recited the verse Mine jlv&h' (Bg X 
18. 3 ) they (all relatives) turn round from right to left and go 
away without looking back. When they have come to a pkce 
where there is standing water, having once plunged into it and 
raised their heads out of it they pour one handful of water, pro- 
nounce the gotra name and the proper name (of the deceased)

that all relatives residing in the same village, if they can trace 
the relationship, do the same, that they wear only one garment, 
suspend their sacred thread over the right shonlder, that with 
ft 3 fourth finger of the left hand they spurt away the water with 
VS]. S 35. 6 and facing the south plunge into water and pour 
out one libation of water with joined hands. The Ap. Dh. S, 
(IL 6, 15. 2-7) lays down a bath when a person's relatives on 
the mother's side and father's relatives up to the 7th degree or as 
long as relationship can be traced die, except in the case of 
children less than a year old In the case of a child's death 
before one year, the parents and those who carry the child's 
body have to bathe. AH the above should have dishevelled hair, 
should throw dust in the hair, wear only one garment, turn 
their faces to the south, plunge into water, offer water to the 
dead thrice and then sit down on the hank (of the river or pond), 
then come to the village and do what the women tell them to do 
(such as touching fire and hull &c). Yaj. m % also provides 
the same rules as Par. gr. and prescribes the recitation of the 
mantra 'apa nah Sosuead agham' ('May evil be burnt away from

agham' ($g. I 97 1. Tai. A. VI 10. 1). It further provides (28. 
1 37-46) that the corpse is carried in a cart or by (four) men 
and while being carried four stops are made, at each of whioh 
clods of earth are dug up and boiled rice is offered thereon with 
mantras like 'pusa tvetah' (Rg. X. 17 3., Tai A VI. 10 1), 
*ayur visvSyur' (Rg. X. 17, 4, Tai. A VI 10. 2). The Varaha- 
purana prescribes that a Pauranic mantra should be recited, 
that the performer should go round the pyre and apply the kindled 
fire towards the part of the pyre where the head is placed. 499 

In modern times the procedure of cremation is generally 
on the lines of that described in the Asv. gr. cited above and 
the procedure described in the Garudapuraua II, 4, US. The 
following is a summary of the procedure set out in the Antyesti- 
paddhati of N&cayanabhatta which is generally followed by 
Ijtgvedins in Western India. The dead body is washed with 
water, is decked with a ttlaka on the forehead, is clothed in a 
garment, is covered with a paste of JatSmamsI and a garland 
of naladas ie placed round its neck. Then the performer washes 
his own feet, sips water, performs pranaySma without Vedio 
mantra, then makes a Sankalpa ( as in note 500 J, 500 he wears his 
sacred thread under the left shoulder (and on the right shoulder) 
and prays to the earth with the mantra 'upasarpa' (frg. X. 18.10), 
he then thrice goes round the place dug up (for cremation) and 
sprinkles water with a saml branch at the end of the mantra 
* apeta' ( Rg. X. 14. 9 ). This mantra is repeated thrice. Then, 
he draws three lines on the ground with an iron pieoe or kuSa 
roots saying 'I draw a line for Yama, the lord of cremation,' I 
draw a line for Kala, lord of &c* * I draw a line for Mrtyu, lord 
of &o ' Then he throws into the dug-up ground pieces of gold and 
sesame and water mixed with sesame in the middle of the dug 
up spot for Yama, to the north for Kala and to the south for

Mrtyu (eaoh being associated -with- pitrs, tlie formula being 
' Yamaya dahanapataye pitrbhyah svadha namah'). He puts 
sesame in the mouth of the corpse and prepares a funeral pile 
sufficient for burning the body by means of sacrificial wood 
brought by the castamen of the deceased. Ou that pile he spreads 
kusa grass and over the latter black antelope skin with the hair 
outside Then the corpse is oarried to the north of the fire and 
is placed on the funeral pile with the head to the south. To the 
north of the dead body, he makes the wife of the deceased sit 
down. Then the husband's brother, pupil or an old servant 
makes her get up with the mantra 'udlrsva' (Rg. X 18. 8). 
Then the performer put3 pieces of gold in the seven holes of the 
body (vide above note 491) or drops of clarified butter. He then 
throws on the body of the departed sesame anointed with ghee, 
he performs pansamuhana (wiping with the wet hand) of the 
fire, then panstarana (strewing darbha grass) round the fire 
together with the funeral pile) and paryuksana (sprinkling 
water) and brings to the south of the fire the vessels viz proksani 
sruva, camasa and the vessel containing clarified butter. Then 
he puts water in the camasa (cup), covers it with darbha grass 
and carries it forward and invokes the camasa with Rg. X. 16. 8 
(imam-agne &c) He makes a sankalpa that he would wait 
upon (or worship) the dead, takes two fuel sticks and offers them 
into fire and performs the worship of Agni, Kama, Loka and 
Anumati by offering clarified butter in fire with the appropriate 
formula (viz. agnaye svaha, agnaya idam na mama). Then he 
offers on the chest of the deceased clarified butter (or prsadsjya) 
(according to some) with the mantra 'asmadvai &c. (vide above 
note 498). Then he prepares apupas (halls) with barley flour 
and mixes them with prsadajya and places portions of the balls 
on the five parts viz. forehead, mouth, the two arms and chest 
with the following mantras viz Rg X 16. 7 (for the ball on 
forehead and mouth), Rg X. 14. 10 (for the two arms) and Rg 
X 14. 11 (for the chest). Then he makes the fire flame up with 
the mantra Rg. X 16 9 (kravyadam-agnim) towards the head 
of a male (and the feet of a woman). Then he should repeat 
cartain mantras while the body is being burnt viz R°- X 14.7-8 
Rg. X 14. 10-11, Rg. X 16. 1-6, X 17. 3-6. X 18. 10-43, X. 154.' 
1-6, X 14. IS While muttering these mantras he should throw 
sesame on the body that is being burnt. Then the performer 
should take a jar (full of water) on his left shoulder, should make 
a hole in it on the back of the jar with a broken but smooth 
stone. He should go round thrice with the left towards the

burning body from the spot where the feet of the corpse lie 
and mutter certain mantras The jar is struck thrice All 
the sagotra relatives go round the burning corpse. Then the 
jar is completely broken near that part of the funeral pyre 
where the head rests The relatives without looking back 
turn to the left and come out of the cemetery with the young- 
est members first The performer recites &g X 18 3 (itne 
jlva &o ). The relatives repair to a spot where water is flow- 
ing, wearing only one garment and with faces to the south 
and hair dishevelled, plunge into the water once, sip water, 
place on the bank that stone (asman) with which holes were 
made in the jar, offer water mixed with sesame on that stone 
with folded hands with the words ' O departed, of such a gotra 
and of such a name J May this water mixed with sesame reach 
you*. The performer offers water with the uttarlya for allay- 
ing the thirst (of the departed) due to the burning. 

Many rules were prescribed as regards the carrying of 
the dead body. It has been seen above that the corpse was 
carried in a cart or on a couch by the relatives or by the sn- 
vants {dams). Some sutras, smrfis, commentaries and other 
works lay down many other rules here The Bamayana 
(Ayodhya 76. 13 ff) states that on the death of Dasaratha his 
Vedic fires were carried by his priests before the corpse 
that the dead body was placed in a palanquin [hhka), tUaS 
his servants carried it and that coins of gold and clothes were 
thrown about on the road in front of the bier (for the poor;. 
The general rule was that members of the three higher varnas 
alone should carry to the cemetery a dead body WwS»J*J» 
any one of those varnas and a siidra should not carry tin ana 
body of a man of a higher casts (when there were men oi

IV] Rules oibout carrying a corpse 215 

"by Yaj. L 34-35. If a brakmacarm carried the corpse of any- 
one except the above five he was held to have swerved from 
his vrata and he had to undergo the expiation for vrafalqpa. 
Manu 5. 103 and Yaj. HX 13-14 state that those who merely 
carry a dead body of their own caste should bathe with the 
clothes on, then bite off nmiba leaves, should perform acamana, 
touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard, place slowly a foot 
on a stone and then enter their house It being the duty of 
sapindas sw to carry the dead body of their relative they, after 
doing so, had simply to bathe, to touch fire and drink clarified 
butter for being pure (Gaut. 14. 29, Yaj. ILL 26, Manu IT. 103, 
Parasara HL 43, Devala a. by Par. M. 1 2, p. 277, Hgrlta q. by 
Apararka p. 871). Carrying tha dead body of a brahmana who 
has no relatives is highly extolled by Parasara (III 39-41.) who 
says that a person, that thus carries the dead body of a brah- 
mana, secures at each footstep the reward of the performance of 
a sacrifice and he becomes pure at onc3 simply by plunging 
into water and performing pranayama, while Manu (5. 101-102) 
prescribes that if one carries the dead body of a person who 
is not a saptnda through affection he becomes pure after 
three days. The Haralata p. 121 quotes the Adipurana that 
if a ksatriya or vaisya cremates the dead body of a poor 
brahmana or of a ksatriya who has lost everything or of a 
poor vaisya, he secures great merit and becomes pure at once 
after a bath Even nosv generally (particularly in villages) 
men of the same caste carry or follow a dead body and are 
held to be purified by a bath with clothes on. The medieval 
commentaries like the Mitaksara stuck strictly to the extreme 
exclusiveness of caste by prescribing « if a man « carries a dead 
body through affection, eats food in that family and dwells in 

•!^°T ? 1S Und6r kwrfty for teQ days; if he simply stays

the same caste as the dead person Bnt if a brahmana carries a 
6udra's corpse, the brahmana is impure for a month, but if a 
Sudra carries a brahman a' s body the sudra is impure for ten 
days.' The Kurmapurana prescribes that if a brahmana carries 
the dead body of a brahmana for a fee cr from otber interested 
motive he becomes impure for ten days, a ksatriya, vaisya and 
iudra doing the same becomes impure for 12, 15 or 30 days and 
the Visnupurana says that the person carrying a dead body for 
a fee has to become impure for the period of impurity prescribed 
for a man of that caste. It may be stated that these rules about 
impurity on the ground of carrying or following the carrying of 
a dead body of another caste are no longer enforced and it is 
extremely doubtful whether they were ever strictly enforced or 
followed Harlta 503 prescribes that a dead body should not be 
carried through the midst of a village if while going to the 
cemetery a village comes in the way, but it should be carried 
away from it. Manu, 5 93 and Vrddha-Harita IX. 100-101 
prescribed that the dead body of a Sudra, vaisya, ksatriya and a 
brahmana was to be taken out respectively by the southern, 
western, northern and eastern gates of the town or village It 
was provided by Yama and the Garudapurana JI 4 56-57 «

one man should carry cooked food in an unbaked earthen vessel 
and another should deposit part of the food on the way and one 
should give clothes and the like to oandalas and the like (that 
stay near the cemetery). 

The Brahmapurana (q. by Suddhiprakasa p. 159) states that 
when carrying a dead body to the cemetery, a great deal of 
noise should be created by means of the four kinds of instru- 
ments, s06 

There were differing rales laid down about vapana (shaving) 
for the performer as an auxiliary (anga) of the rite of cremation, 
after the cremation and bath thereafter, A smrfci test provides 507 
' shaving of the head and moustaches is declared in seven cases, 
viz. on the Ganges, at the BhaskaraksetTa, on the death of the 
mother or father ot guru, on consecrating the srauta fires and in 
a Soma sacrifice*. The A K. D (p. 19) prescribes that the son 
or other performer of the rites of cremation should first perform 
vapana and then bathe, then carry the dead body to a sacred 
spot, bathe it there, or if such a spot is not at hand should invoke 
the presence of the Ganges, Gays and other tirthas in the water 
to be used for washing the dead body, then anoint it with ghee 
or sesame oil, again bathe it and put on it a fresh garment 
should deck it with ya-fiopavita, gopicandana, garland of basil 
leaves and then should apply -to the whole body fragrant subst- 
ances like sandalwood paste, camphor, saffron, musk &c But 
if the cremation took place at night, there was to be no vapana 
at night but on the next day.*"* Other smrtis allowed vapana 
on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or 7th or any following day up to the 
offering of sr addha on the 11th day.sw Ap Dh. S. I 3. 10. 6

SIS Htstoiy of DJiarmaiastra [Vol. 

provides ^tapana for all sapindas that are younger than the 
deceased The Madanaparijata holds that the performer of oiema- 
tion rites had to undergo vapana on the first day and also on the 
expiry of the period of impurity, while the Suddhiprakasa (p 162) 
following the Mit on Y&]. Ill 17 states that the day on which 
vapana is to be undergone is determined by the usage of eaoh 
country. This difference in usages has been even judicially 
noticed. In Chandra choora Deo v. Btbhvti Bhushcm DevaAJ R. 
1945 Fatna p. 211 at p. 219 it has been stated that according to 
the Benares School the person who performs the oremation 
shaves his head at the time of cremation, whereas under the 
Mithila school there is no such shaving at that time. 

The Garudapurana (D. 4. 67-69) provides that loud weeping 
may be indulged in when the body is burning but there should 
be no weeping after oremation and the offering of water to the 
departed. 

There was some difference of opinion as to the offering of 
water {udalcdki-iya or udakadana) to the deceased by his sapinfas 
and samunodalcas Asv gr. quoted above (p 209) speaks of offering 
water onoe, but the Sat. St 28 2. 72 and others prescribe that 
water mixed with sesame is offered thrice with joined hands on 
the day of death to the deceased after reciting his goto, and 
name and every day thereafter up to the 11th & ' Ctant Dh .8

prescribe that water and pinda were to be offered to the 
deceased for ten days. 512 The Suddhiprakasa (p. 203) quotes 
verses from Grhya-parisista, one of which says that some 
declare that only ten afijalis were to be offered, some say 100 
were to be offered and others that 55 were to be offered and that 
one should follow the usage settled in one's vedic Sakha. The 
SJfrr. gr. parisista 3. 4 has a similar rule in prose The 
Garudapur&na(Pretakhanda chap. 5 verses 22-23) also refers 
to the offering of 10, 55, or 100 aiijahs. Some smrtis prescribed 
that the number of afijalis of water were dependent on the caste 
of the deceased. Pracetas (q. by Mit. on Yaj. Ill 4 ) provides 
that 10, 12, 15, 30 afijalis should be respectively offered to a 
deceased person of the brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra 
varna. Yama (verses 92-94 ) states how water is to be offered 
to the deceased standing in navel-deep water and (98) pre- 
scribes that water is to he offered in water to gods and pitis 
hut on the ground to those that died without upanayana being 
performed. In a smrti quoted by Devayajnika S13 it is stated 
that six piDdas were to be offered from the day of death as 
foDows: at the place where the death occurred, at the door of 
the house, where four roads meet, where the funeral procession 
on the way to the cemetery rested, on the pile of wood arranged 
for burning (cita), and at the time of the collection of the 
burnt bones. It was further provided that for the benefit of the 
departed a lamp fed by sesame oil was to be kept burning 
continuously for ten days after death and an earthenware 
vessel was to be kept filled with water and a handful of 
cooked rice was to be offered on the ground at the time of the 
mid-day meal after uttering the name and gotra of the departed. 
This was called patheya sraddha beoause it helped the departed 
to go on his way from the earth to the world of the departed 
{vide Dharmasindhu p 463). According to some of the digests

a srgddha called Ifagna-pracchadana was to be performed on 
the day of the death of a person after his sapindas undergo 
shaving and bath, enter the village and the house. It consists 
in filling a jar with grains of rice wound round with a piece of 
oloth and putting clarified butter in a vessel of bell-metal 
and some gold (01 coins) thereon according to one's ability. The 
whole was to he given to a poor brahmana of good family after 
romembering Yisnu for the benefit of the departed Vide Smrfci- 
muktaphala ( on sr ) pp. 595-596, Sm C ( on JLsauca p. 176 ), 

The smrtis and puranas ( like Kiirma, uttarardha 23. 70 ) 

prescribe that after offering with joined hands water to the 

deceased a ball of rice or barley flour with sesame was tp be 

presented on darbha grass There are two views on this point. 

According to YS]. DI16 a ptnda was to be offered for three 

days after death according to the procedure prescribed for 

Pinda-pitr-yajfia ( such as wearing of the sacred thread on the 

right shouldei and under the left shoulder ), while according to 

Visnu 19. 13 one pin$a was to be offered every day as long as 

impurity on death lasted The pmda was to be offered on 

darbhas spread on the ground if the deceased had his upanayana 

performed, but without mantras or may be offered on a stone * 

While water could be offeied by any and every sapwda, pmda 

was to be offered only by the son ( and when there were many 

sons, by the eldest if free from defect) ; in default of a son the 

nearest sapmda like a brother or brother's son was to «

pindas are offered at the time of cremation, while according to 

the Mithila" school only- one pinda is offered. Everybody, 

whether a person of the same gotra as the deceased or of 

another gotia, had to carry out all the rites up to the tenth day 

when he once b9gan them on the day of death, as stated by the 

Grhya-parisista 517 and Garudapurana. It is further prescribed 

that when the funeral rites are begun by a person and then a 

nearer relative such as a son comes, even then the former is-to 

oairy on all the rites up to the 10th day, but the rites of the 11th 

and later days are to be performed by the son and in default of 

him by a near sapinda. The Matsyapurana states 518 that 

pindas should be offered to the deceased for twelve days ; they 

become his food on his journey (to the other world) and they give 

him satisfaction ; since the deceased is taken to the abode of 

departed spirits after twelve days, he (his spirit) S6es his house, 

sons and wife for twelve days Rsyasmga quoted by ApaiSxka 

( p. 889 ) specifies the limbs of an ethereal body with which the 

deceased is endowed on each day of the ten days after death 

when a pinda is offered The Garudapurana (pretakhanda 

chap. 5. 33-36) says the same. 

Just as sapindas of the same gotra and samanodalias were 
bound to offer water to the deceased, a person was bound to offer 
water to his maternal grandfather and to the two further 
ancestors and to his aoarya on their death. Every man, if he 
so desired (i. e. he was under no religious duty), could offer 
water to his friend, to his married sister or daughter, to his 
sister's son, father-in-law and his sacrificial priest on their 
fm^if 5I ; gr> m - 10 * ^na-Likhita, Yaj. *» IH 4) Paraskara 
(W. 10) refers to a peculiar practice. When the sapindas are 
about to enter water for bathing and thereafter offering water to 
the deceased they pray to their relatives or brother-in-law for 
water with the w ords 'we shall perform udakakriya*, whereupon

the other replies 'do bo but don't come again (with a similar 
request),' if the deceased was less than one hundred years of 
age, but the reply would be simply 'do so' if the deceased was 
hundred years of age or more. 520 The G. P. S. (I, 4. <L-6) has 
a somewhat similar symbolic dialogue. A king's officer, a 
sagotra or a brother-in-law takes a branch having thorns and 
prevents them from entering water with the words 'don't enter'; 
then the sapindas should reply 'we shall not again enter water'. 
The probable significance of this was that they thereby would 
be able to escape from another death in the family soon after. 

There were rules prohibiting certain persons from offering 
water to the deceased and also directing that water should not 
be offered to certain deoeased persons. Impotent ^ persons and 
the like, thieves of gold, vffiyas, those who follow forbidden 
conduct and women that kill their own foetus or husband and 
that drink the kind of liquor (forbidden to them) should not offer 
water to a deceased person. Yaj (111. 6) provides that water 
should not be offered to and no ssauca observed for heretics, for 
those who do not belong to one of the four asramas, to thieves, 
to women who kill their husbands or who are guilty of prostitu- 
tion or who drink surU, or who commit suicide. Manu (V. 89- 
90) is to the same effect. Gaut Dh. S. s * 14. 11 provides that

IV] To whom no water is to be offered 223 

Journey, who commit suicide by fasting or by means of a weapon 
or by fire, by poison, in water, by hanging or falling from a 
precipice or tree, there is no cremation, no Stouca, 
no offering of water or pinda. Haradatta on Gaut, 14. 11 
quotes three verses from Brahmapurana that those who die of 
a brahmana's curse or black magic and those who are patitas 
are dealt with in the same way. But Angiras ( q. by Mit. on 
Yaj. BX 6 ) says that if one dies by water or fire or the like 
through, inadvertence, there was asauca for him and udakakriya 
was performed. Yide Yaik. Sm S. V. 11 for a long list of 
persons who must not be cremated. In the Mahabharata the 
rites of cremation have been described frequently e. g. the 
cremation of Pandu in Adiparva, chap 127 ( the body was 
carried in a itbikU covered on all sides, there were musical 
instruments, the royal parasol and chowries were carried in the 
procession, distribution of wealth to mendicants, carrying the 
dead body to the bank of the Ganges on a charming sylvan 
spot, bathing the body, applying sandalwood paste to it), of 
Dronain Sfcrlparva, chap 23.38-42 (three Samorcswere sung, 
his pupils withDrona's wife in front went round the funeral' 
pyre, going to the Ganges ); of Bhisma in Anusasana 169 10-19 
( fragrant resins were used on the pyre, his body was covered 
with fine clothes and flowers, an umbrella and chowries were 
held over the body, Kaurava women fanned the body with fans, 
sanums were sung ); of Vasudeva in Mausalaparva 7. 19-25 ; of 
killed warriers in general in Strlparva, chap. 26. 28-43 and of 
KuntI, DhrtarSstra and GandhSrl in ' AsramavSsikaparva 
chap. 39. In the Kamayana ( Ayodhya, chap 76 verses 16-20 )' 
it is said that the funeral pyre for Dasaratha was made with 
sandalwood, aguru and fragrant resins, with Sarala, Padmaka 
andDevadam (pine) wood and various fragrant substances 
were heaped thereon, then Dasaratha's body was placed on the 
pyre and that Kausalya and other women followed the corpse in 
stbikas and conveyances aocording to thBii status.

If even the boneB could not be found, then the sutras follow- 
ing the Ait Br. ( chap. 32,1 ) and similar ancient works 51 ' 
provide that on a skin of black antelope one should make 
the effigy of a human frame with palaia stalks (leaves) 
360 in wl number, the effigy should be bound round with woollen 
thread, should be covered with ijava flour mixed with water and 
anointed with clarified butter and cremated with his fires and 
Baorificial implements. The Brahmapursna (q. by Suddhi- 
prakasa p. 187 ) contains similar rules about burning an effigy 
and ordains three days' impurity thereafter. Acb. to a smrti 
( q by ApaTarka p. 545 ), the palaia leaves were to be 362. They 
were to be distributed according to Baud. P S and Gaut.P S. as

IV] Burning of EffigV with pcdaia stallcs 225 

lower parte of the leg,, 10 for toes of the feet MQ 

(a by Apargrka p. 545 ) and Bhavisyapurana ( q. by Suddhi- 

piakasa p. 187 ) say that when a son does not hear for 15 years 

about his father who had gone to a distant land I he should 

perform the cremation of the effigy (called akrtidahana ). 

Brhaspati advises waiting for 13 years before resorting to 

afohdaliana (Suddhipr. p 187). The Vaikhanasa-sraarta-sutra 

V 12 regards the burning of the effigy as a meritorious act for 

every one and does not restrict it to the case where the body or 

bones are not found. The Suddhiprak&sa p. 187 quotes several 

verses from the Brahmapurana that the procedure of burning an 

effigy of palasa stalks was to be followed even in the case of 

one who has not conseorated Srauta fires and asauca for three 

days has to be observed, while the asauca for burning the 

effigy of an ahitagni was ten days. 

It is further provided in Sat Sr. 29. 4. 41, Baud P . S. 

(III. 7. 4) and Garudapurana H. 4. 169-70 that, if after the effigy 

is cremated in the belief that a person died in a foreign land, he 

returns alive, then he is plunged in a pit containing clarified 

butter and then he comes out of it, takes a bath, then all the 

safiiskaras from jatalaxrma are performed on him, then he marries 

the same wife again or if she be dead, he may many another 

girl, then consecrate again Srauta fires. Some sutras provide 

that if the wife of an ahitagni dies before him, he may, if he so 

desires, cremate her with his srauta fires or he may cremate her 

with fire prepared from cowdung and some easily inflammable 

things (lure straw) placed in three sthalis (cooking pots S2 «). 

Manu (V. 167-168) provides that if the samr^a and virtuous 

wife of a twice-born person who had consecrated sacred irauta 

fires died before him she was to be cremated with his fires (srauta 

and smarfca) and with the sacrificial implements. Then he may 

marry again and consecrate srauta or smarta fires again. To the 

same effect are Y53. T. 89, Baud. P S.B.4,6,Gobhila-smrti HL5, 

Vaikhanasa-smartasutra VH. %, Vrddha-Harita XL 2-13, Laghu-

the effect that if a person keeps the same srauta fires after the 
death of his wife they are (impure like) the fires used for 
hurning a corpse and adds that even if a brahmana ahitagm 
had a wife of the ksatriya class and she died before him, 
she was to be cremated with his srauta fires This view is 
opposed to that of many other commentators and he explains 
ManuV 167 (where 'savarnsm' occurs) as merely illustra- 
tive and that if it were interpreted as restricted to a savarna 
wife alone, there would he the fault of vahyablieda. Some of 
the stnrtis provide that he may remain a widower and perform 
his Agnihotra by having a golden effigy of the wife or one 
made of kusa glass, as Rama did Vide Gobhilasmrfci HI. 538

again ( when his wife died before him and was cremated with 
his srauta fires ) and did not conseorate fresh vedic fires he was 
•to be cremated with ordinary fire If the householder was un- 
able to marry again, he may cremate his wife with fire kindled 
by means of the kindling sticks (mams) and keep his srauta 
fires and carry on agmhotia with the image or effigy of the wife. 
H the ahitagni died first and his wife then died as a widow she 
was to be cremated with fire (ntumnthm) kindled by attrition 
of the arums Vide Baud P. S U 4 6-8, Eat Sr. 39 4 34-35,

that a widower and a widow were to be cremated with fire 
generated on a kapala (made red hot and then cow-dung 
thrown thereon), a brahmacaiin and yati were to be cremated 
with uttapana ( or kapalaja ) fire, an unmarried girl and a hoy 
whose Upanayana is not performed aie to be cremated with 
fire produced from chaff If an ahitagni became pattta or guilty 
of suicide in various ways or met death by challenging animals 
or snakes, his srauta fires were to he cast into water and smai ta 
fire was to be cast on the place where four roads meet (or in 
water), his sacrificial implements were to be burnt (a smrti 
q by Par. M. I 2. p. 226, Parasara V. 10-11, Vaik Smarta

that iu the case of abortion, the foetus, and a still-born child, 
and a child that has not yet struck teeth should be decked 
with clothes and the like and should be buried Children 
of tender years were not to be cremated, but there was 
some difference of opinion among ancient writers on the 
exact age at which one or the other method of disposal was 
to be resorted to. Paraskara-gr. «sc m, io j Ya] IU 1, Manu 
V. 68-69, Yama and some others provide that a child that 'had not 
completad two years at death -was to be buried under ground in 
an unsullied spot outside the village (other than the usual 
cemetery), the dead body being anointed with ghee and decked 
with flowers and sandal paste and that no burning nor

and Yaraa allows the recital of the YamasQkta (Jig. X. 14) 
and the verses in honour of the god Yama. Manu V 70, 
however, sfcabes other optional provisions viz. that the offering 
of water may he done { and therefore the cremation also of the 
dead body) in the ca3e of infants that have struck teeth or 
after riamakai ana. Thereforo there is an option as to cre- 
mating an infant of less than two years, viz it'may be buried 
or cremated after namakarana or after the appearance of 
teeth. In this case it is not necessary that all the sapwda 
relatives should follow the dead body If a child is two 
years old or more at death and upanayana has not been per- 
formed it must he cremated with ordinary fire and water 
must be offered silently. The same rule applies to a child 
whose cu$a ( tonsure N ) had been performed before death as 
Btated by Laugaksi. S28 <* The Vaik. 8m. S. V.ll lays down that 
there is no burning with fire until the 5th year for a boy and 
the 7th year for a girl After Upanayana the child was to be 
cremated according to the rites prescribed for an ahifcagni so 
far as they could be applied ( i. e. there would be cremation 
without sacrificial implements and the mantra * asmat tvam- 
abh«atosi ' was not to be recited ) The Baud **» P. 8. 
( II 3.10-11 ) provides that there is no cremation for children 
dying before the perfoimauce of caida ( tonsure ) and there is no 
pitrmedlm for those whose upanayana had not been performed 
at death or for unmarried girls. It also provides that infants 
that have struck no teeth are to be buued with nyQaUi >om 
and those that have had teeth with the VyahHis The M.tt. on

IV] Disposal of an ascetic's corpse 229 

A yati (sannyasin) was andia even now buried ta a 

previous note <n.528b) a verse of Kratu is quoted that a 

brahmacarin and yati are to be cremated with utta-pana fire The 

explanation of the Suddhiprakasa (p. 166 ) is that the word yati 

here means an ascetic of the Kutlcaka kind and quotes a *• 

verse as to how the dead bodies of the yatis of four grades are 

to be disposed of. The** Baud. P. S. 111.11 gives a brief 

description which is adopted with some variations by the • 

Smrtyarthasara (p. 98 ) that contains a description of the death 

rites of a parivrajaka. 532 O ne should so to the east or north of 

the village, he should dig a pit (lit. a sacrificial place) as 

deep as the staff ( carried by the yati ) under a palasa tree or on 

a river bank or on some other pure spot to the accompaniment 

of the vyahrhs; then he should sprinkle water thereon thrice 

repeating the seven vyahrtis each time, should spread darbha 

grass on the bottom of the pit, should deck the dead body ( -with 

garlands, sandal paste), deposit the body in the pit with 

the mantia ( Tai 8X1.3.1 ) ' O Visnu 1 guard this offering ( the 

dead body ).' He should place in the right hand the staff of 

the parivrajaka ( breaking it into three parts ) with the mantra 

' Visnu took strides over this ' ( Bg. 1.23.17, Yaj. S. V. 15, Tai. 

S. 1.2.13,1 ). He places the sikya ( loop of strings ) in the left

they were performed before No cremation should be done, no 
asauca should be observed nor should water be offered to (an 
ascetic who is dead) who was free from all attachments and who 
had given himself up to meditation. The Smrtyarthasara adds 
that no ekoddista sraddha nor sapindikarana js performed for an 
ascetic, but only pat vaw on the 11th day, that a kutlcaka 
shouldbe cremated, the bahudaka should be buried, harnsa should 
be thrown into water and paiamaliamsa should be thoroughly 
buried. The Nirnayasindhu (pp 634-635) quotes the Smrtyartha- 
sara and then adds a few details from Brhat-Saunaka, xiz that 
the dead body of a yah should be bathed with the PurusasSkta 
(ftg X, 90), then the pit (dug for burial) should be sprinkled 
eight times with the syllable 'Om'on all sides; having deposited 
the body in the pit with the Yajus formula 'O Visnul guard 
this offering* (Tai S I 1. 3.1) and with 'Ora', he should place in 
the right hand the staff with the mantra ' Visnu took strides 
over this' (Eg. I 22. 17), then pierce the crown of the head « ith 
a conch by repeating the mantra 'bhur-bhuvah-svah', he should 
fill up the pit with salt to the recitation of the Purusasukta flte. 
X. 90). He should fill up the pit thoroughly (with sand) in order 
to guard against jackals and dogs and the like (exhuming the 
body with their paws) The Dharmasindhu (p 497) adds some 
details particularly as to the number of hymns and mantras to 
be repeated It states that the crown of the head should be 
pierced with a conch or an axe, that one who is unable to do 
this should smash a ball of jaggery placed on the head. It adds 
that no yati except kutlcaka should be cremated. In «nodern 
times a sannyasin is always buried and not cremated, since 
kutlcaka and bahudaka kinds of yati are no longer m vogue 
and it is only the pvamahamsa that is prevalen * «*«» ^StS

IV Why ascetics viere not cremated 231 

appears to me to be as follows; part of the procedure of becoming 
an ascetic consisted in giving up his sraufca fires and throwing 
in fire bis sacrificial wooden implements (vide H. of Dh. vol, H. 
p. 954). One of the rules for ascetics is that he should not 
kindle si auta or smarta fires nor kindle ordinary fire for cooking 
his food but was to subsist on cooked food obtained by begging 
(H. of Dh. vol H pp. 933-934). The householder was cremated 
with his srauta or smarta fire but the ascetic, having abjured 
these, was without any fire and was therefore buried. The 
Vaikhanasasmartasutra X. 8 ( ed. by Caland ) contains a brief 
description of the burial of an ascetic who was not an ahitagni 
and the cremation of an ascetic who was ahitagni. 

Special rules were laid down, about the cremation of women 
dying in or immediately after child-birth and women 
dying while still in their monthly illness. A. smrti quoted by 
the Mit and the Smrti-candrika. (I p. 121) provides that in 
the case of a siitika, one should take water and pailcagavya 
in a jar, should repeat holy texts (such as 'apohistha' Jig 
X 9. 1-9, veraes addressed to Varuna) over them, should 
then bathe the sTdika with water and paficagavya and then 
cremate the body. A. woman in her monthly illness was to he 
similarly bathed and she was to be covered with another 
garment and then cremated. Vide GarudapurSna H. 4 m ff 
and Nirnayasindhu p. 631. Similarly, elaborate rules are pres- 
cribed about the rites of cremation in relation to the death of 

I SSKS-hT 80 ( 1 d6 ^ P - S " M9 > ^yasindhu 
p. o<m ) which are passed over here. 

Dead bodies were disposed off in different ways at different 
times and in different counties The various method T5 2

caves, ** or being mummified (as in Egypt). The general rule 
in India from times of whioh we have literary evidence was 
cremation; though burial took place in certain exceptional 
cases such as in the case of infants, ascetics &c How tho 
ancient Indians hit upon this scientific though rather heart- 
lending method of the disposal of dead bodies it is difficult to 
say 536 . Burials were not unknown m India even in rory earlv 
times, as Atharvaveda 5. 30 14 (ma nu bhumigrho blmvat) 
and 18 2 34 show. The last may be rendered as follow v 
O Agni! bring all those pitrs here in order that they may par- 
take of the offering, those (pitrs whose bodies ) were buried or 
cast aside (exposed) or burnt or deposited above (on troos or in 
caves?) 536 ". In the word 'anagnidagdhah' occurring in Up. 
X. 15. 14, scholars see a reference to burial. But it is quito 
possible that no burial is referred to. If some ancestors wore 
killed far from home m a fight or if they wore kidnapped and 
killed by enemies, their bodies might have been left uncared 
for in a distant land and not cremated nor buried. A passage 
in the Chandogya 537 Up, (Via. 8. 5) is construed by some 
scholars as referring to burials. It may be rendered as follow) • 
Therefore they designate even now a man, an asma who doci 
not make gifts, who has no faith and who offors no <*aerincps ; 
for this is the esoteric doctrino of Asuras. They dock out .the 
body of the dead with bhihsa (perfumes and flowers?), with » 
raiment by way of decoration, and think that they will Om 
conquer the next world. Though tho passage is not quite clear 
the reference to Asuras, their usage of decorating thodcad 
hody and thereby being able to gain the noxt wort, rondo 
probable that the usage of the burial of tho body an o»g ! A™ 
is referred to. In Rg. VII 89.1 tho ta&WWj* Vntuiw.

may I not go to the earthen house*. This is probably a re- 
ference to burial. Besides, after the charred bones were collec- 
ted, they were placed in an urn or pot, which was buried in 
the ground and after a good deal of time a mound (smasana) 
was built upon the bones as will be seen immediately from a 
passage in the Sat Br. and other sources In A. V. XVJH 2 25 
it is said, 'may the tree not oppress them, nor the great goddess 
Earth*, This is probably a reference to a coffin and burial. 

It is somewhat curious that the progressive nations of the 
West, believing in a literal interpretation of the Biblical words 
(such as Matthew 21. 23-33, Mark 12. 18-27 and Luke 20. 37-38, 
John 5. 19-31 and 6. 32-56 ) about physical "resurrection of the 
dead, held fast by burial alone and up to the end of the 19th 
century people in Christendom would not allow the cremation of 
a dead body. The case of Reg. v. Price illustrates how deep 
the sentiment against cremation was and how popular fury 
prevented Price from disposing of the body of his dead child of 
five months by petroleum fire in a field, how he was prosecuted 
for two offences viz. misdemeanor at Common Law for burning 
a dead body instead of burying it and misdemeanor on the 
ground that he attempted to bum the body with intent to 
prevent an inquest being held on it by the coroner. 53 * It was 
only in 1903 that the Cremation Act (2 Edw. 7 Ch 8) was 
passed empowering burial authorities to establish crematoria 
on plans approved by the Minister of Health. The Catholic 
Church does not even now allow cremation. The ancient 
Romans on the other hand held cremation as the honourable 
mean of the disposal of the dead body hut reserved burial for 
the suicide and the murderer. ««««" w*

that the body of Nimi being covered with oil and fragrant Bub- 
stanoes did not become decomposed and looked as if the death 
was recent. 

What the state of things was before the composition of tho 
Rgveda cannot be said with certainty. There is no general 
agreement as to the age of the Rgveda and of the ruins found 
at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Sir John Marshall (in Mohonjo- 
daro vol. I. p. 86) refers to complete burials, partial burials and 
post cremation burials. The excavations at Lauriya 5<1 Nandan- 
garhhave brought to light supposed Vedio burial mounds 
in which has been found a small repousse golden plaque bearing 
the figure of a nude female, the Earth Goddess These and the 
disposal of corpses in paleolithic ages are matters for archaeo- 
logists and are outside the proper scope of the present work. 

The Haralata ( p. 126 ) quotes a passage from the Adipurana 
to the effect that Magas ( Magians ) are buried underground 
and that Daradas and Luptrakas (?) go away after placing 
their dead relatives on trees. SUa 

It appears that among early Buddhists in India hardly any 
religious ceremony was performed, whether the person deceased 
was a layman or even a member of the Order. In tho 
Mahaparinibbana Suttanta the death and the funeral cererconics 
of the great founder of Buddhism are described in chapter VI 
( Section U ff ). All that is gathered from that chapter is tirot 
the favourite disciple of the Buddha, Ananda, uttsred a stanza, 
some of the disciples that were not free from passion wept and 
fell headlong on the ground, while others ( who were Arabnts J 
bore the grief with composure, that nest morning Ananda went 
to the Mallas of KusinarS, that the Mallas took porfumin,

body of the Buddha that lay in the s£la grove with dancing, 
hymns, music, garlands and psrfumes, in making canopies of 
their garments, that on the 7th day they carried the hody of 
the Blessed One to the south but owing to a miracle ( described 
in sections 29-32 ) they carried it through the city by the 
north gats and laid the body to the east ( the general rule was 
that a dead body was not to be carried through the middle 
of a village, and was to be carried to the south but as 
Buddha was so extraordinary and holy the above was 
allowed to he done). The body of the Buddha was then 
wrapped in a new cloth, then with ootton wool, then in a new 
cloth and so on till 500 layers of cloth and cotton wool 
covered the body The body was then placed in an oil vessel of 
iron which was covered with another oil vessel of iron. Then a 
funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes was built upon which 
the body was placed. Then Mahakassapa and five hundred 
brethren accompanying him arranged their robe3 on one 
shoulder (representing the way in which the sacred thread is 
arranged among the brahmanas), bowed down with clasped 
hands, went round the body reverently thrioe. The body was 
then burnt and only bones remained. Then the narrative states 
that Ajatasatru, king of Magadha, the Licohavis of Vesali and 
several others claimed portions of the relics of the Buddha 
Then the relics were divided into eight parts. Those who

ate destined to go to destruction (at some future date when 
pralaya takes place). How is it possible that the world of 
mortals which is (evanescent) like foam will not meet with 
destruction? As the departed spirit, being helpless, has to 
swallow the tears and phlegm cast by kinsmen, they should not 
weep but should perform (obsequial) rites according to their 
ability.' Gohhilasmrti EI. 39 urges 'do not lament for what is 
perishable and what is the characteristic (destiny) of all beings. 
Exert yourselves in the performance of meritorious acts wbich 
will accompany you ' Gobhila then quotes Yaj. HI. 8-10 and 
one verse from the Mahabharata «*« viz. 'All collections are to 
end in dissipation, all rise is to end in fall, all unions in separa- 
tion and life in death'. Apararka quotes the Ramayaua and 
"Vasudeva's words from the Salyaparva to Dhrtarastra on the 
death of Duryodhana. The Par. M. L 2 pp. 292-93, the Suddhi- 
prakasa pp. 205-206 and several other works quote the verses 
of "Visnu, Yaj. and Gobhda. 

The Garudapurana here (H. 4. 91-100) waxes eloquent over 
the immolation of a wife on her husband's funeral pyre, over the 
miraculous power of a patiwata, and states that a brahmana 
woman should not burn herself apart from her husband's body 
(or aftei he is cremated), but that ksatriya and other women 
may do so, that the practice of sati is common to all women 
even including obandala women, but pregnant women or those 
that have young children should not do so and that a woman 
does not become free from the liability to be born again and 
again as a woman until she becomes a Sati. 

After listening to the philosophical discourse of elders the 
relatives return to their house, placing children in front and 
standing at the door of the house, they with minds under control 
bite the leaves of the mrriba tree, perform acamana, touch fire, 
water, cowdung, white mustard ; then they should enter their 
house after slowly (firmly) planting their foot on a stone. 
According M! to Sankha the relatives should touch the tendrils

let them optionally avoid for twelve nights the distribution of

should remain chaste, eat food only once in the day and that 
they should not repeat Veda study, and should give up the daily 
obligatory duties except those connected with Vedic fires. Manu 
{V. 73) adds that they should not eat flesh for three days. Vas. 
{ 4.14-15 ) lays down that the relatives who returned from the 
cemetery should sit down for three days on mats and fast, that 
if they are unable ( to fast for three days ) they should subsist 
on food bought in the market or obtained unasked. Ysj. HI 17 
and Par. 10. 10 s» provide that for the night they should put 
milk and water in an earthen vessel in the open space ( on a 
iilcya) with the words *0 departed one! bathe here (in the 
water) and drink this milk*. Yaj lit 17, Paithlnasi, Manu

departed should perform their own daily rites to be performed 
in the irauta fires_ ( such as Agnihotra and Darsapurnamasa ) 
and in the srnarta fire (such as morning and evening 
homa) on account of the peremptory dictates of the Veda 
(such as « one should perform Agnihotra as long as one lives ' ). 
The commentators have added several limitations and restri- 
ctions. The Mil.® on Yaj. nr. 17 states that, as Manu V. 84

perform their srauta nitya homa during days of impurity them- 
selves, though some get it performed by another (Vide Ysj. HI. 
17, Manu V 84= ). Although there is a text of Gobhilasmrti 
( III 60 ) prohibiting the performance of sandhyU, yet relying 
on a sutra of Paithinasi the Mit says that a man can offer 
water to the Sun in worship; others like the Smrtimuktaphala 
(p. 478) say that sandhya mantras maybe revolved in tbe 
mind, except the pranayama mantras. This is followed in 
modern times in many parts of India. Vismi Dh. S. 226 
prescribes that in impurity due to birth or death homa 
( Vaisvadeva ), giving and accepting gifts and the study of 
Veda cease. The Vaiir Sm. S. VL4 states that the perform- 
ance of sandhyd. adoratioa, all rites for the gods and manes, gift 
and acceptance and Veda study should be given up during 
impurity on death. Gautama 14.44 appears to hold that a 
brahmana is not affected by impurity on birth and death for 
the purposes of Veda study. On the other hand Samvarta 5S1 
(43) affirms that on the days of impurity on birth and death there 
is no performance of the five Mahayajfias nor of Veda study. 
The NityScara-paddhati p 544 states that even in fisauca the 
thousand names of Visnu may be recited. 

Asthisailcayana or Saflcayana means that rite in which the 
(charred) bones (of the cremated person) are colleoted. This 
rite is dealt with in many sutra and smrti works, such as San. 
Sr. IV. 15. 13-18, Sat Sr. 28. 3, 5iv.gr. IV. 5 1-18, Gaut P. S 
I. 5, Visnu Dh S. 19. 10-12, Baud P. S 1 14, Kausika-sutra W.

Gobbila-smrti HL 54-59 (q. by Haralata p. 183). There is great 
divergence of views about the day on which this was to be done. 
For example, Sat Sr. 28. 3. 1 provides: » 'bones are odbo ted

that th8 four varnas should respectively perform saficayatta on 
the 4th, 5fch, 7th and 9th day. The S.sv. gr. S. IV. 5. 1 states 
that saHcayana should be performed after the 10th day from 
oremationinthe dark half, but on uneven ttthis (i.e. 1st, 3rd, 
11th, 13th, 15th) and on a nakqatra which bears a name not 
applicable to two or more naksatras (i. e. except on the two 
Assdhas, two Phalgunls and two Bhadrapadas). Visnu Dh. S. 
19 10, Vaik. Smarta-sutra V. 7, Kaus. 82. 29, Visnupurana 
III 13 14, Kurmapurana (uttara) 23 and a few other works 
lay down that saiicayana must be done on the 4th day after 
cremation. The various texts differ a good deal in details. 
The following is the procedure in the Asv. gr. IV. 5 : — The 
bones of a male should be collected into an urn that has no 
special marks (protuberances), those of a woman in an urn 
that has protuberances but no other special marks. Aged 
persons," odd in number SS3 not being together with women, 
(i. e. not as a mixed assemblage) collect the bones. The per- 
former walks thrice round the spot (where the body was burnt ) 
with his left side turned towards the spot, sprinkles on it with 
a saml branch milk mixed with water with a verse ' sltike * 
( Hg. X. 16. 14 ). With the thumb and the 4th finger they 
( gatherers ) should put each single bone into the urn without 
making a rattling noise (of the bones in the urn), the bones 
of the feet being taken first, those of the head last. Having 
well gathered the bones and having purified them with a win- 
nowing basket (i. e. removing the dust attaching to them) they 
should put the urn in a pit at a place where the waters from 
different sides do not flow together except rain water with the 
verse 'upasarpa' ($g. X. 18.10) and he should throw earth 
( into the pit ) with the following verse ( Rg X. 18. 11 ) After 
having thrown (earth) ho should repeat the next verse <$g. X, 
18. 12 ). Then covering (the mouth of the urn ) with a lid with 
the mantra 'ut te stabhnami' (Eg. X. 18. 13) (he fills up the 
Pit) Then without looking back they return (towards the 
house), bathe in water and then offer sraddha to him alone 
(the departed). Dr. B. K Datta in his paper 'Vedic funeral

242 History of Dharmaiaslra [Vol, 

pp. 223-307 regards (p. 285) Bg. X, 18 as a hymn dealing with 
burial of tho whole body ( and not of ashes ), while he admits 
(p 287) that ftg. X. 16 is a cremation hymn. I dissent from 
him for various reasons; the most important is that if his theory 
bo correct a period of several centuries must be postulated 
between the two hymns. This is inadmissible. 

The Kausikasutra (82. 29-32) prescribes certain details 
differently. It says that tho bones are collected with A. V. 18. 
2. ii, 26, then they aro consigned to a jar over which all frag- 
rant powders aro scattered, then the jar is raised with the 
UtthapanI verses and carried with the verses called Harinis 
(i e. A V. 18 2 11-18). He (thoperformar) deposits (in the 
earth the urn ) at the root of a tree with the verse 'matva' 
(A. V. 18. 2. 25 'May the tree not injure thee all round, may 
not tho wido goddess Earth also injure thee'). 551 

The other sutras present several variations which are 
passed over here, excepting one or two matters. The Sat. Sr, 
provides that the twig should be of the Udumbara tree, that 
the bones aro collected by women of the family of the deceased 
(his wifo and others) odd in numbsr (five or more), or other 
womon (in the absence of women of the family). A woman uho 
is not likoly to have a child should tie in her left hand a Brhatl 
fruit with two threads, blue and red in colour, should step on a 
stone with her left foot, collect the bones first from the teethe 
or head with the mantra 'uttisthata' (Tai A YL 4. 2) ana 
she should deposit those bones in a jar or garment, then a second 
woman of tho same type collects bones from the shoulders or 
arms, a third woman from the sides or hips, a fourth from vn 
thighs or legs, and a fifth from the feet They or mora women 
collect the bones completely. The urn is deposited at the root 
of a saml or palasa tree. ., 

In modern times, particularly in towns and cities, ww 
collection of bones has to be done immediately after cremation. 
The Antyesti-paddhati closely follows the procedure presenwa 
in the Asv. gr quoted above. It says, the P«to«Wj"

H8 walks thrice round the place of cremation with his left

should be dug in a pure spot whereon water would not flow and 
the performer deposits the jar in the pit with the mantra 
'approach this mother, Earth' (JJg. X 18.10). With F»g X. 
18. 11, he throws earth in the pit all round the jar and muimurs' 
with folded hands the mantra ($g X. 18. 12) and he closes the 
jar with a new earthen disk with the verse Rg. X 18. 13 Then 
he should put earth on the jar in such a way that it may not 
be seen by anybody and without looking back should go else- 
where and bathe. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 586 ) expressly states 
that the procedure for the collection of bones may be gathered 
from one's sutra or from the work of Bhatfa (i. e NSrSvana 
Kamalakara's grandfather). ' 

The Tisnudharmasutra (19. 11-12) and Anu. 26.32 state that 
the coUected bones should be cast in Ganges water.since as many 
particles of the bones of a man remain in Ganges water for so 
many thousands of years he dwells in heaven. It was provided in 
the Puranas that a v,rtuous son, brother or daughter's son or a 
relate on the father's or mother's side should cast the bones in 
the Ganges, that one not so related should not do it and tW w 
he does it he has to perform candrayana prayascttfa E™ V„

take out the earth, and then the bones. Then he should bathe 
and purify the bones by touching the bones again and again 
and repeating the mantras ' eto nvindram stavama suddham 
&e ' (Rg VIII. 95. ?-9). Then he should bathe with panea- 
gavya and become pure. Then ho should bathe ten times with 
cow's urine, cow's dung, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter, water 
in which kusas have been dipped, ashes (of sacred fires ), earth, 
honey and water. Then he should sprinkle ( with kusas ) water 
on the bones with the mantras, viz. Rg. 1.22 16, Rg VIII 
95.7-9, »sRg VIL 56.12-14, Rg. X. 1261-8, Eg. X 119.1-13, 
Rg. IX. 1.1-10 (called PavaraanI verses), Jig. X 128.1-^, 
Rg. I 43.1-9 (a hymn to Rudra); then he should offer a 
hiianya iraddha for the deceased, offer pmda to him and perform 
tarpana with sesame. Then ho should cover the bones in seven 
ways viz. by doer-skin, woollen blanket, darbhas, cow's hair, 
hempen cloth, birch leaf and palm leaf. He should cast among 
the bones pieces of gold and silver, pearls, coral and sapphire for 
the purification of the bones, then he should offer into fire 108 
oblations of clarified butter and sesame with the hymn beginn- 
ing with 'udlratam* (Rg. X. 15). Then he should cast the 
bones in holy water; thereby he does not incur the fault of 
touching an unclean object. While answering the calls of 
nature or performing Ucamana one 'should not hold the bones. 

The Nimayasindhu adds (p. 588) that there is no asthi- 
sailcayana for one whose upanayanahad not>been performed. 

The Asv. gr. 1V.6, the Sat Sr. 28 4, San Sr 46 (called 
pandhikarma) and some others prescribe a &anli rite after 
collection of the charred bones of a deceased person. The 
Baud. P. S. (II 3 3) and Visnu Dh. S. 19,19 appear to prescribe the 
Santi rite after the ten days of impurity have expired (' dasaratre 
saucam krfcva santih * ). It is described by Asv. gr as follows: 
They who have lost a guru (father or mother) by death should 
perform on the new moon day an expiatory ceremony. Before 
sunrise they should carry fire together with its ashes and with 
its receptacle to the south with the half verse 'I send away the 
flesh-devouring Agni* (Rg X 16 9) Having cast that fire 
down at a place where four roads meet or som ewhere else, they

walk round it thrice, with their left side turned to it and beat- 
ing their left thighs with the left hand. They should then re- 
turn home without looking baok, bathe in water, have their hair, 
beards and hair on the body and nails out, furnish themselves 
with new jars, pots, vessels for rinsing the mouth, with garlands 
of iami flowers, with fuel of saint wood, with two pieces of saml 
wood for kindling fiie 5st and with branches for encircling the fire, 
with bull's dung and hide, fresh butter, a stone and as many 
bunches of kusa grass as there are young women (in the house). 
At the time of the Agnihotra (in the afternoon) he should kindle 
fire (by means of the aranls) with, the half verse 'Here may thiB 
other jatavedas' (Bg X. 16.9 latter half)'. Keeping the fire burn- 
ing they sit till night silence falls, repeating tales of old men 
(of the family) and stories of auspicious contents, Utliasas and 
PurUqas When all sounds have ceased or when the others 
(members of the deceased's family) have gone to their houses or 
resting place, (the performer) should pour out a continuous 
stream of water beginning at the south side of the door with the 
versa (Rg. X. 53.6) 'spreading the thread follow the light of the 
world' and go round the house endingat thenorth side of the door 
Then having placed the fire and spread to the west of it a bull's

away the blades turning their faces away. The performer should 
look at them while they are salving their eyes, with the verse 
' these women, being no widows and having good huBbandB ' 
( Rg. X. 18.7 ). The former should first touch the atone with 
'the stream containing stones flows' ( Rg. X 53 8 ). After that, 
stationing himself to the north-east, while others go round with 
the firo, bull-dung and a continuous stream of water he should, 
after repeating the three verses ( apo hi stha, Rg X. 9.1-3 ), 
murmur the verse ' these have led round the cows ' ( Eg. X. 
155 5 ), A tawny-coloured bull should he led round. They 
then sit down at a place where they like to stop, having put on 
fresh unwashed garments and they sit there till sunrise avoid- 
ing sleep. After sunrise, having murmurred the hymns sacred 
to the sun and auspicious hymns, having prepared food and 
made oblations with the hymn beginning ' May he burn away 
evil from us ' ( Rg. I. 97.1-8 ), verse by verse, having given lo 
the brahmanas to eat, he should cause them to pronounce 
auspicious words. A cow, a cup of metal and a fresh unworn 
garment are the sacrificial fee for each of the brahmanas. 

A few details may be added from other sufcras. The Sat Sr, 
(28 41) provides that the Santi is performed on the 10th day 
after cremation by a priest, that in the folded hands of the 
wives (of the members of the family) he puts the remams of 
the material used for oblations jwth the veree « these women, not 
being widows' (Rg. X. 18.7-Tai. A. VI. 10 2), that the prwrt 
plants in the earth the stalk of a plant with the verse yatha 
tvam ' ( Tai. A. VI. 10 2 ) *», that after they return home, they 
cook goat flesh and boil wm grains and eat them and then may 
occupy couches and cots (i. e. give up the observances of 
mourning)

the grave sM or monument should not bs built too soon after 

de*th, lest be (the parfoimer) freshen up the sin of the deceased ; 

that he should make it a long time after and whenpaople do not 

even remember the years (that hare elapsed sinea the decease). 

He should make it in uneven years and under a single naksatra 

(i. e. containing a single staT such as Citra and Pusya, and not 

dual such as Punarvasu and Visakha or plural such as Krttika ) 

and on the New Moon day. Let him make it in autumn or in 

MSgha or in summer. The sepulchral mound should be four 

cornered, because the people who aTe worshippers of gods (or 

godly ) make their burial mounds four-cornered, while those 

who are followers of Asuras, the Easterns and such like people, 

make them round. As to the choosing of the ground, the Sat. 

Br. states several views viz. he makes it on ground sloping 

towards the north or, according to some, to the south ; but the 

Sat. Br. disapproves of both the views and prescribes that he 

should make the burial mound on any le^el ground where the 

waters flowing from a southerly direction come to the east and 

stand still without dashing forward and on such a ground one 

may make it (burial mound). Let him make it on a pleasant 

and peaceful spot, but not on a road nor in an open space lest 

he should make the deceased's sin manifest. It should have the 

sun shining on it (at mid-day). It should not be made at a place

where it would 1)8 visible from the village and there should be 
charming objects to its west ( woods, gardens &c). If there be 
no charming objects there should be waters to its west or north. 
He makes it on salt (barren) soil, on such ground as abounds 
in roots. Let him not make it near where grows the Bhumipasa 
plant or where reeds grow, or Asvagandha or Adhyanda, or 
PrsniparnI grows. He should not make it near an asvattha 
tree or near a vibhltaka tree or a tilvaka, a sphurjaka or a 
haridru or nyagrodha tree or other trees that have an evil 
name (like slesmataka or kovidara) For one who has per- 
formed Agnicayana, he makes a tomb after the manner of the 
fire altar. One must not make it too large lest he should make 
the sin (of the deceased) large He should make it just a man's 
size, broader behind (to the west) and broader on the noTfch side 
He encloses it with cords twisted in the non-sunwise way. He 
then bids them to cut out the earth which would be just sufficient 
for making the mound of a man's size. 

The Kat Sr. (21. 3. 1 and 6) closely follows the above direc- 
tions containod in the Sat R1 Br The Sat. St. 39. 1.8 provides 
that when the day of cremation is not known or remembered 
one may erect a mound over the bones ( with clods of earth or 
bricks) on the New Moon day that comes immediately after the 
Full Moon day of Msgha, Fhalgana, Oaitra, VaisSkba or of the 
summer months ( Jyestha and Asadho) 

The Sat. Br. (XIH, 8 2-1) pursues the subject of sepulchral 
monuments as follows : Godly people make their sepulchres so 
as not to be separate from the earth; while those who are of 
the Asura stamp, the Easterns and others, make ^sepulchral 
mounds so as to be separate from the earth «*« J J

He then sows seeds of all kinds of herbs with a single verso 
(Y53.S 35 4); for long life he thereby prays for these (the 
performer's family) and accordingly each subsequent one of 
them dies of old age He then pours out that ( jar of bones ). 
He does so before sunrise so that the sun should rise over Mm 
while he is doing it He does so with Y5j S. 35. 5-6. He then 
says to some one ' Proceed in that ( southern ) direction without 
drawing breath and having thrown down the jar, return hither 
without looking behind.' He then mutters Vaj S. 35.7. He 
then arranges the dead man ( the bones ) limb by limb with Vaj. 
S. 35.8-9. Now thirteen unmarked s® bricks each measuring a 
(human) foot (pacta) have been made and are laid down

Vol II. p 1248 ) The bricls in Agnicayana are as long as the foot of the 
sacrifices Thereon gods have to be worshipped Here it is the fathers to 
be honoured Throughout Sat. Br. XIU 8 2-3 a distinction is drawn 
between what is done for the gods and what is to be done for pitrs in order 
to keep the divine distinct from what belongs to the fathers In Agnicayana 
a bird-l&e pattern is the most frequent (vide H oiDh \ol II p 1249} It 
is hence that the Sat Br. speaks of wings and tails. The heights prescribed 
for teen of the several varnas and for women are symbolic Ksatnyas, 
brahmanas and vaisyas represent the arms, the mouth and thighs of the 
Poruta (as stated in Eg. X. 90.12). The Kit Sr (21413-14) gives ao 
option in the case of aksatrijaviz, the mound maybe as high as the ches 
or as high as a man with upstretched aims.

directs them to bring some soil from a cleft in the ground 
Some dig m the intermediate ( south-eastern ) quaiter and fetch 
.it from there; others dig in the south-west and fetch it north- 
wards ; he may do as he likes ( there is an option ) Let huu 
not make the sepulchral mound too large For a ksafcriya he 
may make it as high as a man with upstretched arms, for a 
brahmana reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hips, 
for a vaisya up to the thighs, for a sudra up to the knee, or let 
him rather make it so high ( for all ) as to reach below the knee. 
While the mound is being made, they hold a bundle of reed 
grass to the north of it. Let him not throw it down after hold- 
ing it up or after bringing it, but let him set it up m the house 
( as it represents offspring) Having prepared it he sows barley 
grain, thinking 'May they ward off (yavaya) sin from mo I ' 
He covers it over with Avaka plants in order that there may be 
moisture ( Aa or joy ) for him and with dwbha grass for softness. 

They fix pegs round it, a palasa one in front, a saml one on 
the north corner, a vgrana one behind and a vrtra SH peg on the 
right (south corner). On the south side they dig two some-

dig seven on the left (north) side and fill them with water for 
sin not to pass beyond They throw three stones each into thB

old chair with a head cushion. He may give more if he desires. 
This i3 the procedure in the case of one who has performed 
Agnicayana* 63 In the case of him who has not performed Agni- 
cayana, there is the same procedure for selecting a site and the 
same performance save that of the fire-altar Having fetched a 
clod from the boundary he deposits it midway between the 
sepulchral mound and the village with Vaj. S. 35. 15 (imam 5W

build I a shed or a seat for a bed. They drive in the eastern half 
or nnddleor western half of it a three-pronged palasa pj. In 
front of it om bom of a sudra woman or a brahmabandhu ( a 
brahmona only m name ) sits down for a dialogue He asks the 
principal wife (of the deceased ) 'will you dwell with me. 1 That 
woman replies to him «I shall not give (what you ask)' The 
same dialogue takes place on the 2nd day. Then on the third 
day she replies « I shall give for one night ' Or if this peculiar 
practice (of talking about dhavana. which literally means 
soxual intercourse') was intended to last for more days than three 
she was to give a suitable reply (viz. for three nights or for five 
nights &o). When the words of the reply are uttered by the 
wife, the performer deposits the bones (of the deceased) at the 
root of the peg and places between the three prongs of the peg a 
jar having a hundred holes at the bottom The mouth of the 
jar is covered with a hide and kusa grass On that jar he 
sprinkles curds mixed with vujma with the mantra ' Vaisvanare 
haviridam* (Tai. A. VL6.1). "When the liquid oozes from 
the jar on the bones he invokes the two verses 'drapaas-caskanda' 
and ' imam samudram ' (Tai. A. VJ 6 ). Then the Sat Sr. (29.1. 
26-29) provides that four brahmacarins or other brahmanas, that 
are pure, tie up their locks on their heads that are to the right 
and keep dishevelled those on the left side of the head, they 
strike their right thighs and also the hide that is wound 
round the jar of bones, fan it with the fringes of their garments, 
go round the peg thrice with their left side towards the jar and 
the people living in the same house ( with the deceased ) and 
women also do the same, S70 that lute3 (vina) are played upon and 
also conches are blown and other instruments like nSltha, 
tuna, panava are beaten and there is also dancing, singing and 
playing on musical instruments. This practice of dhaiana 
( symbolic ) may go on for five, seven, nine, eleven days, half a 
month, a month or a year during which time one has to donate 
food and money { gold &c ) according to one s ability or on 
the last day according to'some. 571 If one may offer a conjecture, 
this rite was intended to assure the deceased roan (represented 
by the charred bones ) that his wife had remained faithful and

Quadrangular but somedtnes round also (sec is- certain 
schools ). The mounds at Lauriya referred to above are round. 

Anoiher feature to be noted is that clods were employed 
(acd so the mound was called /osfac'i) or bated bricks in 
building the mound or grave over the bones by piling up layers 
of clay or bricks In laying down the bricks first on ths east, 
then on the north, then on the west and then on the south, the 
sutras such as Sat Sr. ( 29.1.53 j,* s Baud. P. S. (1 19.4-7 ) fear 
verses were respectively employed that are (in order) Bg X 
1S.13, 10, 11, 12 (which are also A. V. XvTH. 3.5:. 49 50, 51 
andTai S.TI71). One of these (£g. X 18.12) speaks of 
pillars and the other ( Sg. X. 18.13 } of a post ( sthuns ). Tide 
above p 189. The discovery of two wooden post3 in two mounds 
( at Lauriya above) in which the bones were deposited indicates 
that the Lauriya mounds followed avedic custom which is 
mentioned by the srautasutras. The main diferencs between 
the Vedic and sutra ritual on the one hand and iie Lauriya 
mounds on the other is the height of the latter, which betokens 
a later age than that of the sutras. 

The Sat Sr describes in the 28th prah-a what is called 
pHrmedha while in prasna 29 it describes the finrisiarattj. 
The difference between the two is pointed out in Sat. 
Sr. 39.3.4-1S and it is stated 557 (in. Sat Sr. 29,3. SO. 2" ) 
that the mantras called 'catar-hotSrah" are spoken of as brrim 
( in Tai Br. HI. 12.5 ) and that the procedure of Brahnwmedha 
is to be emplovedonly foranocSys or a IraVw? and for no 
one else. The Vaijayantl by Mahadeva states ( in the Inteduc- 
torv verses) that prasnas 28 and 29 of Sai Sr. are taken ,10m

IV] Stages in the disposal of dead hodtes 255. 

modern times. In the Baud. OT P. S. I. 17 there are passages 
that baar a close resemblance to some passages of the Sat. Sr 
on dhavana. Similarly, Kat Sr. s" 21. 3. 6 provides (immedi- 
ately after the months in which mounds were to be constructed) 
that a3 many jars should be taken as there are persons perfoim- 
ing dhavana (or dhuiana) and the commentator explains that 
word as meaning 'fanning*. 

It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India 
was divided into four stages viz. cremation, collecting the 
charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, 
expiatory rites (called Santikarma) and erection of a monument 
over the hones. The last was not necessarily done in every 
case. The Andhau Inscription of the time of Rudradaman 
in the year 53 ( probably of the saka era ) refers to the 
erection of a staff (lasti i e. yasti) as a funeral monument to the 
memory of a sister, brother and wife by Madana son of Sihila 
(vide E 1 Vol 16 pp. 23-25 ). In a long passage of the Brahma- 
purSna quoted by Apararka (pp. 885-886) it is stated that the 
charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an 
urn and deposited at the root of a tree.or oast in the Ganges, 
that the place of cremation should be purified with eowdung and 
water, that a puskaTaka tree should he planted there or an 
eduka (a structure ) should be built over it. 5® 

The Sat Sr 38. 4 28 and Baud P S. II. 3. % state as shown 
above that the rites immediately after death were performed 
only up to the depositing of the urn (containing the bones) 
underground in the case of those householders who had not set 
up the vedio fires and id the case of married women and that in 
the case of mm who had performed the solemn rite of Agni- 
cayana a mound with bric ks ox clods was built up on the bones.

It is remarkable that while slaves and even attendants were often 
buried with the master in Babylon and Celtic Britain, there is 
no similar reference to the burial or cremation of anybody with 
the deceased even in the ancient procedure found in the Sat Br 
It is oiily possible to say that in some cases in the pre-Vedic age 
the wife might have burnt herself along with the decsased 
husband on the funeral pyre. There is no doubt that later works 
like the Visnudharmasutra recommended to women the practice 
of Sad as an option to leading the life of perfect celibacy after 
the husband's death, 

The persons entitled to perform the funeral rites after death 
( anlyalmrmadhtkai m ) are the same as those entitled to offer 
srSddha. There is a good deal of difference as to the order of 
the persons so entitled Tor example, Gautama (t)h.S 15 13-14) 
states 'On failure of sons the sapindas ( e g. brother, brother's 
sou ), the sapindas of the mother (eg maternal uncle or his 
=on)and pupils may perform sraddha for the deceased; ia 
default of these the family priest and the ScSrya (veda teacher).' 
Sankha says 581 'The offering of pinda and water should be 
done by the son for the father; in default (i e absence or death) 
of the son, the wife (of the deoeased) should offer, btitia 
default of her the full brother * The VisnupuranaS" 2 provides • 
'the son, grand-son, great grandson (of the deceased), the 
offspring of the brother (of the deceased), the offspring of a 
sapinda become entitled to offer (pinda)' The Markandeya- 
purana provides (30, 19-31, chap 27. 19-23 of the Veuk. ed.) 'On 
failure of the sons, sapindas, on failure of them the samanoda- 
kas, then the sapindas of the mother, and samaiiodakas of her, 
should perform these rites, a daughter's son should perform them 
( if the man dies sonless), the putrikgputra should perform them 
for his maternal grand-father; in default of all these, vromeu 
should perform these rites for their husbands but without Vedic 
mantras; in default of wife the king should get the ntes per- 
formed by some one belonging to the family (of the deceased )

or by persons of his caste', since the king is the relative 
of all varnas' 583 There was a close connection between 
talcing the estate of a man and performing the rites after 
death, up to the 10th day. for the doctrines represented 
by the MMksara and the Dayabhaga, vide H. of Dh. 
vol IH pp. 734-743. Even those that regarded that inheri- 
tance was based on relationship by blood and not on the 
capacity to offer pindas held that it was obligatory on 
everyone who took the estate of another (including the king 
who took as the ultimate heir by escheat) to arrange for the 
rites after death and sraddha. Visnu 584 Dh. S. XV. 40 declares 
'whoever inherits the estate of a deceased person has to offer 
pinda to him.* Yaj. IL 127 says the same thing about the 
Ksetraja son (ubhayorapyasau rikthl pinda-data ca dharmatah). 
■ The Smrtyarthasara (p. 94) states the order of adfnkarins 
as follows; a competent son is the first adhikari for offering 
pinda; in default of a son, husband, wife and co-wives ; in 
default of these, the brother's son, the brother, daughter-in-law 
daughter, daughter's son, any other sagotra,-& sapinda, a 
fellow-student, a friend, a pupil, the teacher, any relative and 
anyone who takes the wealth of the deceased may offer piyda

vol. 1H p. 739. The Nirnayasindhu 58 * says that in the Kali 
age only two kinds of sons viz. aurasa and dattaka are allowed 
(out of the twelve mentioned by Yaj. H 128-133) and the order 
of sraddhadhikarins is given by it as follows: aurasa son, then 
grandson, then great grandson, then adopted son. If there are 
many sons then the eldest alone is the adhikarin; if the eldest 
be not present or is paitta, then the son next to the eldest is the 
adhikarin (and not the youngest). If the sons are divided 
from eaoh other, then all the rites up to sapindlkarana are to 
bo performed by the eldest alone who may make the other sons 
contribute to the expenses, but the yearly sraddha may bs per- 
formed by eaoh son separately. If the sons (of the deoeassd) 
ara not divided, then all rites including the yearly sraddha 
also are to be performed by the eldest alone 'When the eldest 
son not being present, the younger one or the youngest per- 
forms the cremation, he should perform all rites up to and inclu- 
ding the sixteen sraddhas, but not sapiDdlkarana and he should 
wait for one year for the arrival of the eldest If the eldest 
comes to know of the death within one year, he alone should 
perform the sapindlkarana. If the eldest son does not come 
even at the end of one year, then even the yojngest may par- 
form sapindlkarana. If before the expiry of one year the 
youngest son or some one other than a son performs the 
monthly, anumasika, sapindlkarana sraddhas, then the elcest 
son or a son should again perform these. If there is a grandson

soma one else. A.n adopted son becomes an adhikarin for fune- 
ral rites and the like only if the upanayanahas been performed, 
if there be no lineal descendant up to a great-grandson and also 
no adopted son, then the wife should perform with mantras 
the funeral rites and yearly and other sraddhas but if she is 
unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, then the same rules apply 
as in the case of an ampomita son. Even if the husband be 
not divided from his brother, or be be re-united with his brother, 
it is the wife and not the brother who is to be preferred as 
having adHlmra for sraddha, though the brother gets all the 
property. Though some of the latest works on* dharmasastra 
like the Nirnayasindhu 5 « and Dharmasindhu (bharyayapi 
samanttakam-eva-auidhvadehikadikam karyam) allowed the 
wife to perform rites after death with vedic mantras, several 
works such as the Markandeya-purana and the Brahmapurana 
did not allow the wife to repeat Vedic mantras (vide note 583 
above). In default of the wife, the daughter has the right to 
perform rites after death if the deceased was separated and not 
re-united. But if the deceased was joint then his full brother 
would be the proper adhikarin afteHhe wife. Among daughters 
the married one is preferred, though an unmarried daughter 
is a preferable heir. In default of daughters, the daughter's 
son is an adhikarin ; then a brother, then a brother's son. Among

full sisters, half sisters, younger and older sisters the same rules 
apply as in the oase of brothers; in default of any sister, sister's 
son. If there be many sister's sons, the rules as to brothers 
would apply. Then come paternal uncle, his son, other 
sapindas; 588 then samanodakas, then other persons born in the 
same family. In default of these, the sapindas of the mother, 
such as the maternal grand-father, maternal uncle, maternal 
uncle's son in that order; in default of the sapindas of the 
mother, the sons of the deceased's paternal or maternal aunt; 
in default of these the pitr-bcaidhus such as the sons of the 
father's father's sister, of the father's mother's sister, of father's 
maternal uncle ; then the matr-bandhus such as mother's father's 
sisters's son; in default of these, a disciple (of the deceased); 
in default of disciple, son-in-law of the deceased ( or the father- 
in-law of the deceased); in default of these, a friend; in default, 
any one who takes the wealth of a brahmana (deceased); if the 
deceased was other than a brahmana the king (who took the 
wealth of everyone dying heirless, except the wealth of a 
brahmana) who arranges for funeral rites through another. 

In the case of women the following order of those entitled 
t6 perform rites of a deceased woman is given in thB Dhaima- 
sindhu (p. 370); H the female be unmarried then her father 
is the ndhikarin, then her hrother and the like; if the woman was 
married, her son, then her co-wife's son, then co-wife's grandson 
and then great-grandson; in default of these, the husband; in 
default of husband, daughter, then daughter's son ; thenhusbana t 
brother; then husband's brother's son; then daughter-in-law; 
then (the deceased) woman's father, then her brother; then 
her brother's son and the rest.

should not at all carry the dead body of any one except of the 
above five or perform the cremation and other rites for any one 
else, if a brahmacarin performed all the rites for ten days he 
had to observe asauca for ten days, but if he performed only the 
cremation he had to observe asauca only for one day. Even 
while in mourning his obligatory acts do not stop ; but he should 
not eat the food oooked for his relatives that are in mourning 
nor should he dwell among them; if he did (both these) he had 
to undergo prayascitta and perform upanayana again. 

It is somewhat curious that Baudhayana, the LingapurSna 
(quoted in Sraddhaprakasa pp. 361-371), the Markandeya- 
purana, the Pitrdayita (p 82 ) and several other works allow 
man himself while living to perform his own rites after death 
(antyesti).sw This will be dealt with briefly later on under 
svaddha Further, if a man became paiit a and refused to undergo 
prayascitta, he was driven out of the Hindu fold by the pro- 
cedure of ghatasphota (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 387-388 ), and 
Gaut. Dh. S. 30 2 and Manu XI. 182-183 provide that such a 
man was to be held to be dead and his relatives were to perform 
all rites for him such as offering water and sraddha and were 
also to observe aiauca for him. 590 

Many commentators and digests quote certain verses of the 
Vismipurana (IU. 13. 34-39) wherein the rites {knyah) after 
death performed for a person are enumerated as falling into 
three classes, via. purva, madhmma and uttara. The rites from 
cremation up to the end of the 12th day are called pflrva, the 
sraddhas performed monthly and sapindikarana and ekoddista 
are called madhyama rites and those that are performed after 
sapindikarana, when the deceased has reached the position of 
pit t after being a preta, are designated uttara.^ The pflrva and

madhyama rites of the deceased may be performed by the father, 
the mother, sapindas, samanodakas and those belonging to the 
deceased's group (gotra) or by the king if he takes the wealth 
of the deceased. But the rites called uttara are to be performed 
only by the son, grandson, great-grandson, daughter's son or 
the latter's sons Even in the case of -women, on the day of the 
anniversary of death every year an ekoddista sraddha may be 
performed for them. There is also another classification of 
sraddhas viz. Navasraddha { those rites up to ten days aftsr 
death), Navamisra (those performed after ten days up to six 
seasons ), Purana (those performed after a year ). 551 * 

As stated above, for ten days after death a handful of water 
mixed with sesame was to be offered to the deceased on a stone 
(aimem) placed on kusa grass and one large pinda (called 
puraka-piBda) was to be offered on kusa grass everyday 
with the face to the south and the sacred thread on the 
right shoulder (praolnavlt!) for the purpose of freeing the 
departed from the state of being a prela. On the pinda, water 
mixed with sesame was to be offered and leaves of Bkrngaraja 
(called maka in Marathi) and Tulasf also. The verse 'anadi- 
nidhano' was to be repeated 592 . The performer throws the 
pinda m water and then bathes. Vide A. K. D pp. 43-50 and 
Antyesti-paddhati of Narayana for detailed treatment of the 
procedure of these ten days. Besides this, the Asvalayana-

siaddhas' (or Visamasraddhas) performed on the uneven days 
(i e 1st 3rd 5th, 7th and 9th) with uncooked food. According 
lo'tbe Garudapurana (Pretakhanda 34. 36 which speaks of six 
Sraddhas on uneven days from 1st day to 11th) and Apastamba 
they are six (Dharmasindhu p 464, Niroayasindhu p 588, 
Suddhiprakasa pp. 314-216, Sraddhatattva p. 619 ) and accord- 
ing to others there is an option. Angiras and Vasistha speak 
of six Navasraddhas on uneven days from the 1st to the 11th, 
while Baud Pitrmedha S. 1L 10. 6 speaks of five. Some 
prescribe the placing of some cooked food sprinkled with ghee 
on the hand of a brahmana. Others do not approve of this 
They prescribe the placing of uncooked corn in front of a brah- 
mana or in front of a figure of a brahmana made with kusas 
( called cata in Marathi ). The Garudapurana (H 5. 67 ff ) holds 
that the navasraddhas are those performed at the place where 
a man died, where the funeral procession rested on the 
way, when the bones were collected and those performed on the 
5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th day. The Suddhiprakasj 
p. 214 quotes similar views from Katyayana and the view oi 
Vrddha-Yasistha that the deceased does not become free from 
the status of a preta, unless the navairaddhas are performed. 
The Garudapurana, Pretakhanda ( chap. 34. 27-28, 44, 48) states 
that by the pindas offered for ten days the several limbs of a 
subtlo body are provided for the dsparted spirit which at first 
wanders like thin air. There are several differing views on 
the navairaddhas which are passed over here. On the uneven 
days if navasraddha is performed two pindas will be offered 
(one the daily one and the other, of the navasraddha). The 
Padma (Srstikhanda 10. 19) prescribes that one should not par- 
take of the food at navasraddha and on doing so should undergo 
the candrayaua expiation. 

In modern times, after the rites of the first day of crema- 
tion and of the collection of the bones, the rites for the dead 
generally begin on the 10th day. The performer goes to the 
place where the rites of the first day were performed, makes a 
sanfcalpa and offers a pinda with the words 'May this pinda 
wait upon the preta named N. IT. and of the gotra (Kasyapa 
&o ) in order that hunger and thirst affecting the preta may be 
removed*. Then he offers water mixed with sesame, plaoes 
leaves of bhrAgaraja and tulasi, repeats the verse 'anadini- 
dbano* (note 592), removes the pinda to another place from 
the plaoe where it was offered. Then he prepares a i-edi with 



264 History 'of Dfiarihaiaatra [ Vol 

loose earth with a triangular shape, purifies it by means of 
cowdung, decks it with turmeric powder and places thereon 
five jars full of water and on each of them a ball of rice. Then 
he offers a request to the middle jar with the words 'May this 
pinda together with the jar of water wait upon the preta by 
name N. N , of such and such a gotra in order that his hunger 
and thirst may be allayed'. There is a prayer before the 
jars to the east, south, west and north respectively f o those 
whom the preta had befriended, to Yama, to crows, to Rudra 
respectively. There is a difference of view here, some pres- 
cribing four jars, some three, while otheis offer a pindo with 
the jar of water only on the place meant for the preta and mere 
pinda to others Then water is offered over the pinda and to pach 
of the above he offers sandals, umbrella, banner, bread. Then 
the performer waits till a crow seizes or eats the pinda placed to 
the west s9i . Then the asman (stone) is anointed with oil and 
cast in wateT. Then the performer requests the relatives, who 
offer one handful or three handfuls of water to the .preta on the 
bank of the reservoir of water. Then the sons and others accor- 
ding to usage cut their hair and nails. Then all persons of 
the same gotra, according to the custom of the country, bathe 
with sesame and myrohalan, wear pure and dried garments, go 
home and take their meals there. _

17 ] Ethereal body after death 265 

Some of the Puranas and medieval digests assert that aftei 
a man dies, the soul or spirit assumes what is called an 
atitiahika %n " body consisting of three of the five elements (viz. 
fire, wind and akasa ) that rise up from the dead body (while 
two viz. earth and water remain below), that such a body is 
obtained only by men and not by other beings, that with the 
aid of the pindas that are offered to the departed at the time of 
cremation and during ten days thereafter, the soul secures 
another body called bhogadeha (a body for enjoying the pindas 
offered) and that at the end of a year when sapw&Vcarana is 
performed, the soul secures a third body wherewith the spirit 
reaches heaven or hell according to the nature of his actions. 
The word 'ativahika' is comparatively an ancient one. It 
ocours in Vedantasutra 17. 3.4 (ativahikas-tal-lingat). But 
there the meaning is somewhat different. The Upanisads speak 
of the soul as going by the path of arm, day &c. The sutra

tion of a piiaoa, from which he would not be freed even if 
numerous other sraddhas were later on offered fox him. 595 The 
Brahmapurana calls the body 'yatamya' (i. e. one that lias to 
undergo trials and torments), while the Agnipurana calls it 
'yataniya'or 'ativahika' and asserts that this body is made 
up of the elements of SMia, vayu and tejas The Padmapurana 
(H 67. 98 ) states that persons who commit certain sins secure 
after death a body similar in shape to the physical body for 
undergoing torments. The underlying conception was that 
when the gross body was destroyed after death by cremation, 
burial or other methods an intermediate subtile body had to 
be built up before the departed soul was compelled to assume 
another body in a fresh incarnation The subtile body was gradu- 
ally built up, as stated by the Mark 10.73, by the rites performed 
on death and on several days after death. Though this con- 
ception is very clearly set forth in the PurSnas it should not 
be supposed that it was altogether a new one. It had its roots 
deep down in the earliest Vedic period and was implicit in 
some of the hymns as indicated by Eg. X 15. 14, X 16. 4-5 
translated above. Though in # the Tai. S. I 8. 5 1-2 and in 
passages of the Tai, Br, and Sat. Br to be set out later on it is 
said that the offerings are made to the paternal ancestors, it 
does not follow that the brahmanas were not fed at the same 
time on the food prepared for being offered to the ancestors, 
just as in the solemn Vedic sacrifices offerings were made to 
the gods, Agni, Indra, Prajapati, Vismi and others and atthe 
same time priests engaged in the sacrifices were fed and given 
presents ( dalcsiriB. ). Therefore, it need not be necessanly sup- 
posed that feeding the brahmanas at sraddha was a later idea 
and offering food to the dead was the original idea.

CHAPTER YIII 

SUDDHI 

Suddhi (purification) is a very comprehensive topic 
including within it purification after asauca (impurity on 
birth and death ), purification of a person after oontact with 
an impure object or on account of certain occurrences, 
purification of pots, wells, food &c, after they are polluted. 
A.sauca, however, is the most important subject under suddhi 
and therefore the Suddhi-kaumudl defines 'suddhi' as 'the 
state of being fit for or capable of performing the rites that are 
understood from the Veda ' &i The Sinrtis employ the word 
suddhi in relation to purification after asauca. 3?or example, 
Manu V. 5? starts by saying that he will expound purification 
after a man is dead ( pretasuddhi ) and purification of things 
(dravyasuddhi). Manu V. 83 { = Daksa VI. 7 ) avers that a 
brahmana becomes pure after ten days ( on the death or birth 
of a relative ), a ksatriya after twelve &o. The Paras ara-smrti 
starts chapter three by declaring «I shall expound Suddhi on 
birth and death.' Y a j. m 14, 25 also employ the word suddhi. 
Therefore asauca on birth and death will be first dealt with.

Manu V, 84 (na vardhayed-aghahani ) the word 'agba' has 
come to mean the same thing as asauca. 597 The Padmapurana 
H. 66. 73-74 states that since the outlets of the body always 
emit mueus, urine &c. it is always impure. 

The Mit. on Yaj. HI 1 defines S9S asauca as an emergent 
attribute attaching to a person, which is got rid of by lapse 
of time or a bath and the like and which is the cause of the 
positive direction to offer (to a deceased person) pinda, water and 
the like and of the cessation of Vedio study and other actions 
The Mit adds that asauca is not merely the absence of the 
privilege or power to do religious acts, since even those who 
have incurred impurity (on death &o ) are enjoined to do 
certain religious acts such as offering water ( to the deceased ) 
This definition of the Mit appears to be an echo of the Gorudn- 
purana ( pretakhanda ) 5. 9 and is probably based on a verse 
of the work called Sangraha. Haradatta 59 ' on Gautama 14. 1 
states that asauca may be defined ag 'the absence of the 
privilege to perform religious acts, unfitness for bamg ono 
whose food may be paTtaken of, untouchability and the loss of 
the privilege to make religious gifts.' A. comparatively early 
writer Bhattaoarya, m appears to have defined 'suddhi' as the 
* removal of sin * or as ' being fit for performing religious acts." 
This was accepted by the Smrti-candriks, but rejected by 
Nandapandita, commentator of Sadaslti (pp. 2-3) Eventho 
Mii (on Yaj. HT. 18) emphasizes that asauca has two 
characteristics, viz. it takes away the privilege of performing

religious acts and it renders a person untouchable. The 
SmrMmukfcaphala MIowb this. Budradhara in his Suddhiviveka 
( D. C ms. No. 309 of 1887-91 folio 1 ) says that suddhi is a 
special attribute which brings about a capacity or privilege for 
the performance of all dharmas, while asuddhi is an attribute 
opposed to suddhiand arises on the occasion of the birth of a 
sapimla or the like. m 

£sauca is of two kinds, viz. that arising on birth 602 ( and 
bo called janariaiawxi or sutaka) and that arising on death 
(and therefore called satasauca or mrtakasauca or maranasauca). 
Saw is derived from iava (meaning a corpse). The word 
sutaka occurs in the 603 Ait. Br. (chap. 32. 8) and is there 
probably used in the sense of impurity on both birth and death. 
There it is said that if an ahitagni partook of food from the 
house of him who was affected by sutaka, then the prayascitfca 
was to offer a puroQu&a cooked on eight potsherds to Agni 
Tantumat. Tantu means also ' son or progeny ' and so it may 
ba argued that it is an indication that sQtaka is used in the 
Ait. Br. in the sense of impurity on birth. The word sutaM is 
used in the smrtis in three senses: (1) impurity on birth 
(videManu V. 58); (%) impurity both on birth and death, as 
inGobhilasmrtilII;6dand63;«>* (3) impurity on death alone 
(asinDaksa vXl and Gobhilasmrti m. 48)«* In SQme f 
the modern vernaculars (such as MaratM) the word 'sutaka' 
is used to the 3rd sense alone. In each of these two divisions 
there are two varieties viz. where the duration is brief or com- 
paratively long ( Sadaslti, verse 3 ). 

A question arises why birth and death should cause im- 
punty to the member s of the family or to relatives Only a 

602. a^isT^^P^^^^^, ^ g k 47?) 



270 Mislay of Sharmaiaslra l vol, 

few have to say anything on this question. Harlta says ■ 'the 
family incurs death impurity because by death the family feels 
overwhelmed (or frustrated), while when a new life appsars 
the family increases (and there is gratification or joy) ' m . 

The literature on Suddhi (including asauca) is very exten- 
sive. Apart from the sutras, smrtis and Puranas there are 
numerous digests dealing with the subject at great length 
Some of them have been printed. The smrtis contain a mass of 
contradictory dicta to such an extent and different from the 
usages of medieval times that the Mit on Yaj m, 23 after 
quoting the views of ParaSara, Satatapa, Yasistha and Angjraa 
on the periods for which imparity had to be observed by per- 
sons belonging to the four varnas refuses to erolre order 
out of them and remarks that the usages in its day ware diffe- 
rent from the dicta of those sages 637 . The Madana-parjjata 
(p 392 ) agrees with the Mit and also suggests other modes of 
dealing with the conflict. Two examples may be cited of 
the way in which different smrtis approach the same problem. 
Atri 83 ParSsara EL 5 and Daksa VJ. 6 provide that a brahmana 
who has consecrated the three Vedic fires and has mastered 
the Veda becomes free from impurity (on birth and deatt) 
inoneday.one who has merely mastered ^the Veda (bu thas 
not consecrated the srauia fires) m three days and one * ho

by Haralata p. 5 and Haradatta on Gautama 14. 1) states that a 
brahmana who is endowed with Veda and srauta fires becomes 
pure after three days, one who is devoid of srauta fires ( but 
is master of the Veda ) in five days and one who is only a 
brahmana by caste (has not studied the Veda or does not 
teach it ) in ten days. The San Sr. and Mann 6ro ( both quoted 
above ) urge a man not to increase through laziness the number 
of days for which impurity is to be observed. It is possible 
that persons claiming to be learned observed impurity for a 
few days only, while neighbours disputed their claim to this 
special dispensation in favour of Vedic learning and keeping 
srauta fires. The result was that later on a flat number of ten 
days was prescribed for all biahmanas whether learned or not 
and the provision for lesser number of days of impurity was 
relegated to Kaliowjya usages. Vide H. of Dh. vol ID, 
pp. 941-42. 

Another example of the dependence of the days of impurity 
on the caste of the deceased and of varying dicta thereon may 
be cited. Manu V. 83, Daksa VI 7, Yaj HI. 22, Mri (verse 85), 
S^if i 15,M) ' Mats y a P«ana (18. 2-3), Brahmapurana 
220 63, Visnu Dh. S 22. 1-4, all lay down periods of 10 days 
U days, 15 days and a month for impurity among brahmanas 
Ksatnyas, vaisyas and sudras respectively. Yaj. HI.22 makes the 
virtuous sudra observe impurity only for 15 days as a concession, 
taut (15. 1-4) prescribas 10, 11, 12 days (or half month) and a 
month respectively for the four varnas, while Vas. (4 27-30) 
gives the periods of 10, 15, 20 and one month for the four

provides that a sapvnda who is 4th in descent from the common 
ancestor of the deceased and himself hecomes pure after ten 
days, one who is 5th after 6 days, one who is 6th in descent 
after four days and one who is 7th after one day. The Mit. 
says that this should he discarded as it is in conflict with many 
other smrtis and is disapproved .of by people. 610 Some of the 
rules mentioned by Yijnanesvara (about 1100 A.D ) themselves 
underwent changes in 500 yeaTB as noted by the Nirnayasindhu 
(composed in 1612 A. D. «» ). 

The Mil on Yaj III. 18 declares that when a child that has 
not completed two years dies, it is the parents that have to 
observe asauca for ten days and not all sapindas and that their 
asauca entails untouchability for them. The JTirnayasindhu 
(p. 517) remarks that what VijSanesvara said is not now (in 
its time) the usage and that the Smrtyarthasara also did not 
accept Vijfianesvara's view. 

In view of the above-mentioned circumstances no useful 
purpose would be served by setting out in detail the varying 
diota of the smrtis, Puranas « 2 and the digests upon the several 
matters that fall to be treated under asauca. Digests on this 
subject are too numerous to mention. The following printed 
ones and a few mss have been made use of in preparing the 
following account. In the first place, there are several works

commentary by an anonymous writer that names the bhasya of 

Maskarin on Gautama-dharmasutra (on p. 35) deals with the 

subject in eight sragdhara verses. The AsaucadaSaka or 

Dasasloki attributed to Vijnanesvara seems to have been a 

very popular work. There are several commentaries on it. The 

one by Hanhara is the earliest of them. In the Decoan College 

collection of Mss (now at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, 

Poona ) there are several Mss of it, two of which were copied 

in samvat 1539 (D. C. No. 216 of 1879-80) and saihvat 1579 

(D. C.No 196 of 1884-87) and which expressly state that the work 

was composed by Vijfianesvara-yoglndra, The ten Sardula- 

vikrldita verses of the Asaucadasaka are set out in the appendix. 

The Kalpataru of Laksmidhara has a section on suddhi which 

has been recently published in the G. O. S. The Haralata of 

Aniruddha is very useful (B.L Series). The Asauoakanda of the 

Smrticandrika has been edited by the lata Dr. Shamsastry and 

published as 35To. 56 of the Mysoie University Sanskrit publica- 

tions.The Trimsacchloki with the commentary of Raghunatha 

composed in iake 1645 has been published at the Poona Ananda- 

srama press and contains 30 Sragdhara verses on asauca. The 

Sadasiti ( 86 verses in the Anustubh metre ) of Kausikaditya 

with the commentary Suddhicandrika by Vinayakacr/wsNanda- 

pandifca ( composed about 1600 A, D.) has been published in the 

Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The Suddhikaumudi of Govinda- 

nanda ( B. I Series ) ; the Suddhitattva of Raghunandana 

( ed. hy Jivananda pp. 233-412), the Suddhiprakasa (part of the 

Viramitrodaya of Mitramisra ) published in the Chowkhamba 

Sanskrit series, the Suddhimayukha of Nllakantha ( edited by 

Mr. J. R. Gharpure ) and the Smrtirauktaphala of Vaidyanatha 

(edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) are compilations that are useful 

in their own way. These exhaustive treatises on asauca show 

one thing unmistakably that brahmanas of the medieval ages 

attached an extremely exaggerated importance to ceremonial 

purity of tbe body on birth and death. 

The periods of impurity depended on many circumstances.. 
There was a difference between impurity on birth and that on 
death; so also the duration depended upon whether the deceased 
was an infant or a male or a female or one whose upanayana 
had been performed or not performed ; it depended on caste and 
also on the question whether the deceased died near the relative 
or far away; also upon the degree of relationship ; and on the 
time that elapsed from the birth or death till it leached the eara' 
a. d. 35

of the relative. The intensity of impurity was different'in each 
of the following: a sutika (a freshly delivered woman), 
rajasvala ( woman in monthly illness ), impurity on death, 
impurity on birth ( the last being the least ). 

Daksa ("vT 2-3) states that there are ten varieties in 
impurity, viz. immediate purity ( after taking a bath ), one day, 
three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fort- 
night, a month and till the end of one's life 613 Daksa then 
explains in what cases these different periods apply. As to 
what is meant by impurity till life's end (lit till he is reduced 
to ashes ), Daksa ( Vl 8-10 ) says . ' those who take their meala 
without bathing or offering to gods or without making gifts- 
all such persons are in impurity till life ends. One who is 
permanently afflicted with a disease, who is close-fisted ( i. e. 
stints himself, wife and son and religious acts through greed ), 
who is always in debt ( i. e. who has not paid off his debts to 
gods, sages and manes), who is bereft of religious acts ( nttya or 
«<M7nift»fei),wb.oisafooland is under the thumb of his wife, 
whose mind is bent on vices ( gambling, prostitution &c ), who 
is always dependent (a king's servant or the like), who is 
devoid of faith and benevolence ( charitable gifts )-he incurs 
impurity which ends only with his ashes (I e. only when he is 
cremated). « These words are not to be taken literally ; What 
is meant is that such a man is to be shunned by others ( i e it 
is an artliavada conveying merely censure ) 
We shall now turn to the impurity on birth. 
That the impurity on birth lasted for ten days even ^in 
Vedic times can be inferred from the story of SondH»P

inference can probably be drawn from Tai. Br. II. 1 1.3, where 
it is said ' therefore people do not take the milk of a cow for 
ten nights when a calf is born,' 61S 

Abortion in the first four months 6l6 of pregnancy is called 
srava, abortion in the 5th or 6th month is called pata and from 
the 7th month of pregnancy onwards it is called prasuti or 
prasaia ( according to Parasara HI. 16, Sadaslti verse 9 ). When 
there is srava the mother incurs impurity for three days, in the 
case of pUta the mother has to observe impurity for as many 
days as correspond to the months of pregnancy ( i. e» 5 days or 
6 days ). The impurity consists in the mother being untouchable. 
The father alone has to bathe when there is srava, but when 
there is pata the father and sapindas have to observe impurity 
for three days ( according to Madana-parijata p. 380-381 and 
others) hut they don't incur impurity as on death. These rules 
hold good for all castes. But when the foetus comes out dead 
in any month from the 7th or the child is still-born, then the 
impurity is for tan days for both parents and the sapindas for 
all varnas or for 10, 13, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four 
varnas as laid down in Taj. (HI 22) and the samanodakas 
have to observe asauca for three days and sagotras for one day 
{ Dharmasindhu p. 427 ). The above rules are more or less laid 
down by Gautama 14. 15-16, Baud. Dh, S. J. 5. 136, Parasara 
IE. 24, Mann V. 66, Yaj. m. 20 ( latter half ) and the first verse 
of Asaucadasaka. The mother is untouchable for ten days on 
.birth, still-birth or abortion in 7th, 8th or 9th month but the 
father and sapindas « 7 when they take a bath after the prasava 
are not untouchable < Tea. EI. 19 ). In ancient times there were 
several differing views about jananaiauca for the father as 
vouched for by Baud .«■ Dh. S.L5 125-128. Although a woman

there is no asauca on the ground of birth when the period of

at her father's or brother's house, then her parents and her 
brothers staying with the father had to observe asauca for one 
day ( Dharmasindhu p. 427 ), but if a woman was delivered of 
a child at her husband's house then her father or brother had to 
observe no asauca ( on birth ). Even when sagotras have to 
observe asauca on birth they are not untouchable (§adasltl 
verse 6 ). 

It would be better to state here certain general rules once for 
all When any text employs the word day (ahah) or night (rain) 
in prescribing the duration of aiauea what is meant is ahoriilia 
(both day m and night ). When counting the days of asauca 
one has to begin from the day of the cremation, if the deceased 
was an afotngm, but from the day of death in the case of one 
not an UMagm™ ( £sauca-dasaka verse 4, Kurma, Uttarardha

are known to the person who is to be affected by it and not by

passages of Paraskara gr. HE. 10 and Maim V. 75-76 and the 
Brahmaparana. Paraskara (IDL 10) provides : 62i 'if one who had 
gone abroad dies, (his relatives) should on hearing (of his death) 
sit down and offer him. water and should remain untouchable 
for the days that remain out of the proper period ( viz. 10, 12, 
15, 30 days ) ; if the prescribed period ( of asauca ) has expired 
they should observe asauca for one night or three nights,' 
Manu ( V. 75-76 ) is to the same effect. The Brahmapurana 
states: 'if a donor makes a gift and the acceptor accepts it 
when both are not aware of there being a birth or death in 
their family, no blame attaches/ 

We should now turn to asauca on death Here again there 
is no unanimity and therefore the views perferably of the 
latest works (such as the Dharmasindhu) will be set out after 
referring to a few smrfci passages. Asauca on death renders 
those who incur it untouchable and unable to perform religious 
rites. Par. gr. IDL 10. 39-30 (S. B. E. vol. 29 p. 357) stated gene- 
rally that the imparity caused by death lasts through three 
nights and that according to some teachers through ten nights. 
If a child dies within ten days of birth, the father and mother 
have to observe Janana&mca and become purified by the end of 
the asauca on birth and the father remains untouchable for 
those days (Kurma-^urana q. by S. K. p 21). If a child died 
before it struck teeth the sapmfas had only to undergo a hath, 
while the parents had to observe asauca for three days if the 
child was a son and for one day if a daughter ( vide Taj. 
in .23 Sankha 15. 4, Atri95, Asaucadasaka verse 2). If the 
"fit Sf.V* Btrikin S tseth but before Cuds (or the end 
ot the third year) the sapindas had to observe* asauca for one 
day and night (Yaj. HI. 23, Sankha 15. 5), but the parents 
had asauca (of death) for three days. If the child was a

after three and before marriage or 16 years the ssauoa is three 
days for all sapindas. After sixteen years or marriage (iu the 
case of a sudra) it is the asauca prescribed for his caste, hi 
the case of a girl dying after three years and before vUgdana 
( betrothal ) the parents hare asauca for three days and 
the sapindas ( up to three generations ) one day. If a girl 
dies after vagdana and before marriage the Bapindas of 
her father as well as of the proposed bridegroom had to 
observe asauca for three days. In the case of women and 
sudras if death takes place after marriage or after 16 years 
(if the Sudra was unmarried) the period of asauca for all 
sapindas is ten days, if a woman dies at her father's house 
after marriage, her parents, step-mother, full brothers and 
step-brothers have to observe asauca for three days and her 
paternal uncle and the like that stay in the same bouse with 
her father for one day. Some say that if the married daughter 
dies in a village other than that of the father, the parents have 
to observe asauca for a paltsmi 62S (i. e. two nights with a day 
between or two days with a night between). There are other 
views on this point which are passed over. For example, 
Visnu-dharmasutra (23. 33-34) says that in the case of a 
married woman there is no asauca on the parents' side j hut 
when she is delivered of a child or dies in the fathers house 
then the impurity is for one day or three days respectively 
A married woman has to observe asauca for three days for the 
death of her parents or step-mother if ten days have not itapMO 
from the day of death or for the remaining days_ cm \_ of tt»

then the Ssauoa is for a paksinl and if the death occurs in 
another village then there is asauca only for one day. The 
same rules apply to step-brothers and step-sisters and also 
among sisters. A. married woman on the death of her paternal 
grand-father or paternal uncle has to undergo only a hath. If a 
maternal uncle dies, the nephew and the niece have to observe 
asauca for a paksinl. If the maternal uncle dies in the house 
of the nephew then there is asauca for three days and for only 
one day if the maternal uncle had not his upanayana performed 
or died in another village; the same rules apply to one's 
mother's step-brother. If the wife of a maternal uncle dies, the 
nephew or the niece of the maternal uncle have to undergo 
asauca for a paksinl If a nephew whose thread ceremony has 
been performed dies, his maternal uncle and maternal aunt 
have asauca for three days The same rules apply if the 
deceased be the son of a step-sister of the maternal uncle. If 
the niece (sister's daughter) dies there is only a bath for the 
maternal uncle. If a maternal grandfather dies, the grandchild 
(the son or daughter of a daughter) has to observe asauca for 
three days, but only for a paksinl if the maternal grandfather 
dies in a different village. On the death of the maternal grand- 
mother the grandchildren have to observe asauca for a paksinl 
Some works do not prescribe asauca for a female descendant 
such as a niece or grand-daughter. If a daughter's son, whose 
upanayana bad been performed, died, the maternal grandfather 
and grandmother had to observe asauca for three days and for 
paksml if the daughter's son had not upanayana performed for

upanayana had been performed; but if no upanayana was 
performed or if he died in another village a mere bath is 
enough. 

On the death of one's mother's sisters ( full or half ) the 
person { whether man or woman ) has to undergo asauca for 
a paksinl ; the same rule applies on the death of the father's 
sister. If it is a step-sister of the father then a mere bath is 
enough. The father's sister has to undergo a bath if the 
nephew dies If one's father's sister or mother's sister dies in 
one's house then the asauca is for three days. 

In the case of "bandhus ( described by the Mit. on Yaj, 
IT. 135 as bhinnagotra sapindas) of 627 the three kinds, the 
asauca is for a paksinl, provided the bandhu is upanita but if 
he died before upanayana then asauca is for one day and if 
the bandhu died in one's house then for three days If the 
daughter of the father's sister (and of the other bandhus enu- 
merated m the three verses ) dies married, the asauca is one 
day, but if they die unmarried only a bath is necessary 
Among the three kinds of bandhus, a man himself and his 
three atmabandhus have to observe asauca for each other's 
death; but the case is different as to pitrbandhus and malr- 
bandhus. If any one of these latter dies, there is asauca for 
the man whose bandhus they are, but if a man dies, his prtr- 
bandhus and matrbandhus have to observe no asauca. 

If an adopted son dies, his natural father and adoptive 
father have to observe asauca for three days (the Vjavahara- 
mayukha differs from this ) and the sapindas for one day. 

If the adoptive or natural father dies, the adopted son has 
to observe asauca for three days and for ^dayfefe 
sapindas of any one of them. On ^ " * ^"JE

vice versa. These rules apply if the son adopted is not a sapinda 
ox samanodaka of the adopter, when he was in his family of 
birth. But if a Bagotra sapinda or a samSnodaka be adopted, 
then the asauca is for ten or three days respectively. 

If one's Scan/a 628 dies, the pupil has to observe asauca for 
three days, but only one day if he dies in another village 
(Gautama 14. 26, 52, Manu V. 80 ). On the death of the Scanjet's 
wife or son the asauca is for one day. m On the death of a 
guru (who instructs in Vedio mantras) the asauca is three 
days and paksinl if he dies in another village. On the death 
of a teacher who imparted instruction in grammar, astronomy 
and other afigas (subsidiary Iotos) of the Yeda, the asauca is 
one day. Similar rules are laid down about the death of a 
pupil, rtmlc (sacrificial priest), a Bacrificer, a dependent 
srofcriya, a fellow-student, a friend, which are all passed over as 
not now useful Vide Gaut. 14. 19-20 (which prescribe one 
day's asauca on the death of a fellow-student or a dependent 
srotriya ). 

These provisions about asauoa on the death of the acarya 
and rtvik who were not aapindas show how closely the bond 
between teacher and pupil was thought to be in ancient times, 
almost equalling the tie of blood. "When a yati (ascetio) 
dies,* 30 all his sapindas have simply to undergo a bath (and 
nothing more). Conversely, a yati and brahmacarin have to 
observe no asauca Manu V. 82, Yaj in. 25, Vismi 22.45, 
Sankha 15. 15 provide that on the death of the ruler of the 
country in which one resides one has to observe asauoa up till

1 3 9 14 declares that there is no Veda study till a corpse 
lies in the village The Smrti-muktaphala (p 541) quotes 632 
several smrtis to the effect that m a village in which a corpse 
lies unremoved, there is to be no eating, no Vedic study and 
no sacrifice, but that this does not apply where in a village 
there are more than four hundred brahmanas. The Dharma- 
sindhu ( p 433 ) also says the same about a village, but adds 
that this rule does not apply to a town 

The ideas of ritualistic purity went so far as to provido 
( as stated in the Suddhitattva quoted by the Nirnayaswdhu ) 
that if a dog died in a brahmana's house the house became 
impure for ten days, that, if a sudra, 633 a patita or a mlcccha 
died in a brahmana's house, the house became impure for a 
month, two months or four months respectively and the houso 
had to be abandoned if a ivapaka died therein

that, if a person stays in a different country and hears of a 
birth or death among his sapindas, he has to observe asauca 
not for ten days after hearing but for that number of days that 
axe short of the ten days (counting from birth or death) pre- 
scribed for sapindas. Vide Manu V. 75, Yaj HI 21 (latter 
half), Sankha 15.11, Par. gr HI. 10 Asauca interferes very 
much with one's activities and it is hence that often-tinies 
people send a closed letter to their relatives living in a different 
place stating thereon that it be opened on a particular day 
(which is the 10th day from the death of a sapinda). Every- 
one knows the meaning of such a direction and by such a 
subterfuge inconvenience is avoided and the dictates of the 
saatra are deemed to be satisfied. If a son hears of the death 
of a parent he has to observe asauca for ten days from the day 
of hearing, but if he hears of the death of a parent before the 
collection of bones then he has to observe asauca only for the 
days that remain (Smrti-muktaphala p. 534). There is great 
divergence about the psriod of asauca if the death of a sapinda 
comes to one's ear3 more than ten days after the day of death. 
Manu V. 7? provides that on hearing of the death of a sapinda 
or the birth of a son after ten days (from the event) a man be- 
comes pure after plunging into water with the clothes on and 
Yaj m. 21 (last pada, 'purne dattvodakam sucih ' ) states that 
be becomes pure after (a bath and) offering water when the 
period fixed has passed off. From the words of Manu that only 
the father, even if he hears of the birth of a son more than ten 
days after the event, has to take a bath the Mit infers that 
there is no 3tikrantasauca for sapindas on birth 635 . The Mit. 
quotes Devala in support (vide note 621 above). The Dharma- 
sindhu follows the Mit. Manu V. 76, Sankha 15.12, Kurma- 
purana (mtarardha) 23.21 state that when ten days have passed 
after the event of death, the man who hears of the death is 
impure for three days and if he hears of the death more 
than a rear after death, he becomes pure after a bath. In order 
to remove the conflict among smrtis Vrddha-Vasistha lays 
down 'asauca is for three days if the news of death is heard 
Within three months (but later than ten days after death), for 
apaksinl if it i 3 h ear a w ifcb.j n s i s mon tbs (but later than

[Vol. 



three months), for one day if heard before nine months (but 
later than 6 months ) and thereafter ( i. e. up to one year but 
later than nine months ) one becomes pure by a bath. But the 
Mit. says «* that this holds good as to all except one's parents 
and quotes Paithinasi and another smrti for the proposition 
that whenever a son staying in a distant country hears of tho 
death of a parent whether within a year or after a year he 
has to observe asauca for ten days from the day he becomes 
aware of it. Laghu-Asvalayana (30.88) lays down the same 
exception in the case of a son. The Mit. ( on Yaj. HL 21 
last half) further says that the rules about ahkranffisauca 
apply only to a deceased person whose upanayana had been 
performed. The Dharmasindhu ( p 433 ) remarks that there is 
no atikrantasauca as regards the periods of one day and three 
days prescribed on the death of one whose upanayana had not 
been performed or as regards the periods of paksini and *hree 
days on the death of the maternal uncle and others of a 
different gotra. Similarly, there is no atikrantasauca with 
reference to the asauca for three days prescribed in the case 
of samanodakas; but in these cases even after the lapse of the 
fixed time a bath is necessary. The rules about atifo antaiauca 
apply only to gsauoa on death for ten days. As in the case of 
the son, so in the cases of husband and wife and of co-wives 
among themselves even after the lapse of more than a year and 
even if the death is in a different country the husband or wife 
or co-wife has to observe asauca for ten days The parents, even 
when they hear of the death of an aurasa son after a year, have 
to observe asauca for three days. On the news of the death of 
a sapinda living m the Bame country coming to a sapinda's ears 
after ten days but up to three months, the period of asauca is 
three days, paksini up to 6 months, up to nine months one day 
and up to one year a bath. Here also there are various views 
such as those of Madhava and others. Vide Suddhiprakasa 
pp. 49-51 for various views.

one of the three will suffice or whether 60, 40 or 30 yojanas

The Dharmasindhu (p. 435) provides that if the bones of 
an Shitagm were not found and only an effigy of palasa leaves 
were burnt, still the asauca is for ten days even if he died in a 
different country and a long time had elapsed. Similarly, m 
the case of the effigy of one who is not an ahitagni, the asauca 
is for ten days for his son and wife if they have not already 
observed any'ssauca for him but if they had observed it { on 
hearing of his death ) then for three days ( on the burning 
of the effigy ). For other sapindas ( than the son and wife ) 
in the same circumstances three days and bath are respectively 
prescribed. 

It is provided in the 'Grliya kankas, the Smrtyarthasara 
(p 94), Dharmasindhu (p. 435) and other works that if a 
man* 12 went to a distant country and no news of his being 
alive was heard, then his son (or other relative), after fee 
lapse of 20 years from the time when no news was heard if the 
man went away when he was young or 15 years if he left

(h) the duration of asauca depended on nearness of blood i. e. 
whether the person affected was a sapinda or a samanodaka 
(Gaut 14 1 and 18, Manu V. 59, 64); (i) the duration depended 
also on the nearness or distance from the place of death 
(Laghu-Asvalayana 20. 85, 89) , (j) it also depended on whether 
the deceased died in a different country separated by a large 
river, a mountain or thirty yojanas (Laghu-Asvalayana 20.87); 
(k) duration depended on the time that elapsed before it came 
to the knowledge of the relative; (1) the duration depended 
upon whether another asauca supervened when the period of 
the first was not over. 

If a person is horn ot died at night or news thereof is 
received at night, a question arises as to from what day the 
periods of asauca are to be calculated For example, if a man 
died at 1AM. on Monday, was Monday to be included in 
counting ten days of asauca or was it to be excluded ? There 
aretwovwvysonthis point. «- One view is that any Mm a 
before midnight is to be counted as belonging to the previous 
day, white any time after midnight is to be taken as belonging 
to the next day. On this view in the above illustration 
Monday would be excluded in the calculaMoTof ten day S

parts and if death occurs in the first two of the three parts 
then the day is to be included in the calculation; if the 
time of death falls in the 3rd part, the ten days are to be 
calculated from the next day. On this view Monday would be 
included in the ten days. The Eharmasindhu (p. 435 ) remarks 
that in this matter the usage of the country is to be followed. 
Vide Madanaparijata pp. 394-395 also. 

Several rules are mentioned in the smrtis about the periods 
of aSauca for the relatives of higher castes when they marry 
women of lower varnas (i e when there are anuloma marri- 
ages). For example, Daksa VI. 12 says that if a brahmana 
has married wives of the four varnas, then the impurity on 
the delivery or death of these women respectively lasts for 
10, 6, 3 or 1 day Visnu Dh. S (22, 22-24) provides that when a 
frsatnya has sapindas of the vaisya or sSdra varna the asauca 
on the birth and death of these lasts for six or three days, if 
a vaisya lias a sudra as sapinda then impurity is removed 
after six: days. But when people of lower varnas have sapindas 
of higher varnas then impurity on birth and death cea»ea 
when the impurity of the higher varna sapindas ceases. 
Laghu-Harlta 84 ( - .Spastambasmiti IX verse 13) has similar 
provisions. Other smrtis and puranas like the Eurma {Uttar- 
ardha 23.30-36) mention differing views quoted in Bferatetl 
pp 54-60, Smc M. pp. 495-496 The Madanaparrjata wraarks 
pp 485-486 ) that some say that these varying provisions may 
be discarded or that they may be assigned their proper place 
according to the usages of the several countries <* they should 
somehow be explained as based upon the P^ ***?*£? 
possessed of virtues or not or they may be held to be appn 
oable to seasons of distress or otherwise.

is no asauca for them. 

It has already been stated (p 215) how it was the duty of 
m ^sltk* out the corpse and to cremate it and bow c arry 
S the dead body of a poor brahman was highly eulogised 
?! aSaTa m. 39-40). But, as Manu V 101-102 provide if a 
teahmana carried through affection the dead body of one , « who 
was not his sapinda, as if he were a bandhu or carried (thefead 
body) of hfe mother's bandhus (such as mother b hrothei paster) 
he became pare after three days; but if he partook of the food 
of those who were bereaved by death he became pure after ten 
days and if he does not stay in the house of those bereaved nor 
partakes of their food he becomes pure in a day {hut if he stays 
in their house though not partaking of their food he has to 
observe asauca for three days). Vide Kurmapurana (Uttarardba 
S3. 37 ) and Vismi 22. 7-9 also. Gautama ( 1 4. 21-25 ) has mles 
on the same subject but they somewhat differ and Haradatta 
remarks that this asauca is somewhat different from the asauca 
observed by sapindas, viz. he becomes untouchable but he need 
not follow the other rules such as sleeping on the ground &c. 
If a person carried a dead body through greed (for money), a 
brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sfidra had to observe asauca 
respectively for 10, 12, or 15 days or a month. This was called 
mrharSsauea, the word 'nirhara' 647 including the covering of the 
dead body with a garment, decking it with garlands, perfumes 
and ornaments, carrying it and cremating it. Sapindas who 
are observing asauca for the death of the same person may dine 
in the same house and partake of the food cooked, hut not 
others who are not undergoing the same asauca. 648

prescribe that a brahmana should not follow the funeral pro- 
cession of a deceased brahmana, but if he doas so, ha has to 
bathe, touch fire, take in ghee and then he becomes para. 
Parasara HL 43-46 and KurmapuraDa (Uttarardha 23 45) provide 
a rising scale of the days of asauca if a brahmana follows the 
corpse of a ksatriya ( asauca for one day aDd paficagaTya ), a 
vaisya (asauca for two days and six pranayarnas ), a sudra 
( asauca for three days, bath in a river going to the sea, 100

verse 13. 

If a brahmana who is not a sapinda of the deceased went 
to the bereaved family and wept along with the relatives before 
the collection of bones he had to observe asauca for a day and 
then a bath if the deceased was a ksatriya or vaisya, but asauca 
for three days if the deceased was a sudra; but he had to undergo 
only a bath if he went after the collection of the bones, when 
the deceased was a sudra and the wearing took place after the 
collection of bones he had to observe asauca /or a whole day

asauca Vide Visnu Dh. S. 22.19, Devalasmrti verse 6, 
Brhaspati quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 14.4. But as slavery 
has long been abolished this topic is passed over here. 

Maucasannipata or aiaucasampata (the knowledge of 
another aSauca coming to a person already observing one 
asauca ) ™ The rules about this matter were promulgated early 
enough and they are based on convenience and common sense. 
The rules try to give relief to persons who may be sorely tried if 
it were held that, when another asauca supervenes while a person 
is already in the midst of one, he has to finish all the days of 
the first asauca and then begin the period of the second asauca. 
The Gaut. Dh. S. 14.5 starts by saying that if another aSauca 
supervenes on one already being undergone, purification results 
after the remaining days of the first asauca are over. Then 
sutras 6 and 7 provide that if the second aSauoa supervenes in 
the last night of the first Ssiauca then purification results in two 
days after the first asauca ends and if the second asauca comes 
to be known in the last watch of the night of the last day of the 
first asauca, the second ends in three days after the first ends.

IV J Rules on GiaucasannipSta 293 

2nd rule is that if both asaucas are of the same kind and the 
second is of the same duration or of lesser duration than the 
first then a man gets rid of both at the end of the first, but if 
the seeond, thougb of the same kind, has a longer duration than 
the first, then purification follows at the end of the one that is of 
longer duration. It has to be remembered that birth and death 
give rise to asauca 658 only when they are known by a person. 

On this topic there is a good deal of divergence between 
the views of the followers of the MitSksarS, of the Gaudas and 
Maithilas (vide Suddhiprakasa pp 74-82, Nirnay&sindhu 
536-510). Following the Nirnayasindhu it may be said that 
twelve alternatives are possible, when another asauca supervenes 
on an already existing one. They are set out her e. ( 1 & S ) Tf 
both asaucas are due to birth and the second is of the same 
duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the 
first asauca there is purification from both (Visnu S2.35, Sankha 
15 70); (3) If both asaucas are due to birth and the second 
one is of longer duration than the first then purification results 
at the end of the second (Sankha 15.10, Sadaslti 19 ) ; ( 4 and 5 )

duration (Sadaslti 18); (10,11) H the <*' first asauca arises 
on death and the supervening one is due to hirth and is of lesser 
duration than the one on death or of the same duration then 
both end at the expiration of the first asauca on death (Sadaslti 
21); (12) If the first asauca arises on death and the super- 
vening one arises on hirth and is of ]onger duration, then bath 
run their proper courses (Sadasiti 21) 

The Dharmasindhu (p 43G ) generally follows the Xiraiya- 
sindhu but remarks: 'Asauca on death cannot be done away 
with by asauca on birth which is of the same or greater dura- 
tion; asauca on death of the extent of paksini cannot get rid 
of asauca on birth which is three or ten days in duration and 
asauca on birth extending to ten days cannot be got rid of by 
asauca on death which is of three days' duration ' These are 
the views of many writers A certain writer says that 5sauc3 
on birth though longer in duration can be got rid of by asauca 
on death which is of lesser extent 

The Mit on Yaj. IE 20 (first half) states an exception to 
the above rules about gsauca-sanmpata When a parson s 
mother dies and then, while the period of asauca for the mother 5 
death is not over, the father dies, it does not foil ro -that .the 
asauca for the father comes to an end with the end *&> -»

K, while an asauca on death is being undergone, an asauca 
on birth arises, the father of the child born is able to perform 
the rites of Jatakarma and the like, because he is to be deemed 
to be purified for the nonce, according to Prajapati. 461 

The Sadasiti (verse 32) provides 661 that the ru]e about 
purification on the expiry of the first asauca in the case of 
succeeding asaucas on birth or death has three exceptions, viz. a 
woman who is delivered of a child, the person who actually 
cremates the body (of the deceased) and the sons of the deceased ; 
that is, a sukka has to observe the proper period of untouch- 
ability and one who cremates a dead body has to observe asauca 
for ten days, thotigh the delivery or cremation takes place in 
the midst of an asauca on death. 

SADYA.H-SA.tJOA. (purification on the same day). It has 
already been seen (p S74) that Daksa (VI 2) speaks of ten kinds 
of impurity on birth or death, the first two of which are sacli/ah 
satica and ekaha Ekaha means day and night together (vide 
note 622 above) The ordinary meaning of 'sadyah' is 'at

(pp. 340-341) explains 6S1 'sadyah' as meaning 'a portion of the 
day or of the night" and cites several authorities in support 
The Suddhiprafcasa ( p 92 ) explains that ' sadyahsauca * in some 
contests means 'absence of asauca,' while in others it means 
'bath* and with reference to those killed in battle and the like 
(to whom pindas have to be offered) it means 'a part of the 
day or of the night* The Smrtimuktaphala 665 (5S3UcasSnda) 
p481 says that 'sadyahsauca* means 'impurity that comes to 
an end by a bath * That pindas have to he offered to those 
about whom there is ' sadyahsauca ' is stated by the Acipurana K5 
According to the SuddhifcaumudI (p 73) 'sadyahsauca' has two 
meanings, viz. (1 ) the entire absence of asauca as in the cases 
of sacrificial priests &c (Yaj HL 28), (2) asauca that if 
removed by a mere bath ( as in Manu V. 76 ) 

The rules about aiauca for several days do not operate in 
five classes of cases, viz certain persons are exempted altogether, 
certain activities of certain persons who would ordinariJr be 
untouchable owing to asauca are allowed without causing pollu- 
tion, certain articles can be taken by anybody without fear of 
pollution from those who are affected by asauca, no asauca is to 
~be observed for certain deceased persons owing to their faults, in 
the case of certain persons expressions say that no asauca need 
be observed for them These five classes will briefly be dealt

IV ] Cases of sadijah-sauca #97 

Yaj. ( III. 28-29 ) prescribes that thera is sadyahsauca 
(purification after a bath) in case of birth or death (of a 
sapinda) for priests chosen for a sacrifice (after they are 
offered Madhuparka ), for those who have undergone diksa for 
a vedic sacrifice ( like Somayaga ) and those who are engaged in 
performing the constituent parts of a Vedic sacrifice, those 
who continuously distribute food at a charity house, those 
who are engaged in pT§yascittas like candrayana or the vows 
of znatalas, for brahmacarins ( when performing the duties of 
their us) ama), for persons who everyday make gifts of a cow, 
gold etc (at the time of making the gift), for those who 
have realized Brahman (ascetios) ; there is sadyahsauca at gifts 
( when once begun), at marriage, in a Vedic sacrifice, in battle 
(for those who are about to be engaged in it ), when there is 
commotion in a country ( through invasion ), and in a severe 
calamity (like famine when one can accept food from any body). 
Gaut. (14. 43-44) says that there is sadyahsauca in the case of 
kings as otherwise there will be -obstacles in their duties and 
also in the case of brahmanas in order to prevent the cessation 
of their duties of teaching. Sankhalikhita say the same 'B*j& 
dharmayatanam sarvesam tasmadanavaruddhah pretaprasa- 
vadosaih ' ( Suddhikalpatara p. 62 ). Tt is stated in Manu V. 93 
that kings, «' those engaged in vralas and sattras (like 
Gavam-avana) are not liable to undergo the blemish of 
ssauca, because they (kings) ocoupy the position of Tndra 
(ruler) anS are like Brahma (which is free from all taint) 
and Manu V. 94 clinches the matter further by observing 
sadyahsauca is ordained for the position of a king which «an 
be obtained only by great merit ( in past lives ) for the sake of 
theprotectwnofthe subjects and the reason of this (rule) j s 
the portion that he occupies.' Similarly, Gobhilasmrti «

298 History of Dharmaiastra [ Vol. 

( III 64-65, often quoted a3 Chandogaparisista of Katyayana) 
states 'in a sutaka, a brahmacarin should not give up his 
peouliar duties (Veda study and vratas ), a saonfioer his various 
actions ( required ) in a sacrifice after he has undergone dlksa, 
one who is practising penance should not give up krcchra and' 
the like ; these do not incur impurity even on the death of their 
father^ (or mother)' The Kurmapurana « M provides 'no 
impurity is declared on death in the case of perpetual or 
temporary brahmaosrins, forest hermits or ascetics '. Similar 
rules are given by AM 97-98, Lmga-purana, purvabhSga, 
chap. 89.77. The Mit. on Y&j III. 28 remarks that m the case 
of the three asramas of brahmacarin, vanaprastha and yah there 
is freedom from impurity in all oases and at all times; ascetics 
and brahmacarins have to undergo a bath with clothes on the 
death of their father or mother ( Dharmasindhu p. 442 ); in the 
case of several others such as those who are continually making 
gifts or are observing vratas there is freedom from impurity 
only when they are engaged in those particular actions and not 
when they are engaged in any action whatever or when they 
mix up among others for everyday work. 6n Similar rules 
occur in ParSsara IH.21-22. It has already been stated follow- 
ing Manu V. 91 ( ■» Yisnu 22.86 ) that a brahmaoarin was not 
to perform the last rites (of carrying the corpse, cremation) for 
anybody except for five persons (viz. his parents, upadbyaya, 
acSrya and guru ) He did not incur Ssauoa by performing the 
funeral rites of his parents and offering water and pinda to them. 
But if be did so for any one other than the five mentioned by 
Manu he had to observe asauca for ten days, and to undergo 
prayasoitta and had his upanayana performed again. A brahma- 
carin had to observe after samavartana (returning from the Vedio 
teacher) sSauca for three days for all relatives that died during 
the period of his studenthood ( Manu V. 88, Visnu Dh. S. ZZ.87J.

who aie separated by a country, of ascetics and of those who 
are not sapindas, the relatives are purified by only a bath; so 
also there i3 sadyahsauca for kings, for otherwise there would 
be conflict with their duty (of protecting the subi'eots ) and for 
a brahman a also in order that there may be no cessation of 
Yedic study. 672 The Suddhiprakasa (p. 93) remarks that though 
there is no asauca ( as stated by Yaj HI, 28 ) yet a sacrificial 
priest and a dlksita had to bathe on the death of a sapinda, a 
brahmacarin also would have to take a bath if he followed the 
funeral procession of his father or mother &c , but an ascetic 
would not have even to bathe and that usage was the same in 
its day. 

The second class of exceptions refers to cases where certain 
parsons, though they have incurred asauca, aTe allowed to do 
certain acts ot carry on their activities without bringing pollu- 
tion to those with whom they deal or come in contact For 
example, Parasara (HI 30-21) says; 'craftsmen (such as" those 
who draw pictures or washermen ), workers ( cooks and the like ) 
physicians, male and female slaves, barbers, kings and srotriyas 
are declared to be sadyahsauca, as also one observing a wata

on death should not stop rites to be performed with irauta fires 
but should perform them themselves or get them performed 
through others. Thus certain religious rites were allowed to be 
done even by those who were Simian. 

The Dharmasindhu (p 552) emphasizes that this exception

It has already been stated how certain materials and things 
can be reoeived without any pollution from those who are

The fourth class of cases where rules of asauca do not apply 
relate to persons deceased to whom some fault or taint attaches. 
Gaut. (Ull) 677 and Sankha-Likhita provide that there is 
sadyahsauca for those who kill themselves (i.e. commit suicide) 
by starting on the great journey (to the Himalaya), hy fasting, 
by a weapon (like a dagger), by fire or poison or water or by 
hanging or by falling down from a precipice.

particular tisrama, that &v& thieves (of gold and the like), 
that ( attempt to ) kill their husbands, that are unchaste and

deserve to have water offered to them ( on death ) and no asauca 
should be observed for them. This verse applies -to men also 
as far as possible. Manu V. 89-90 are to the same effect. 
The Km-mapm-ana also prescribes * 79 that for him who kills 
himself by means of fire, poison and the like, no asauca, no 
OTemation and no offering of water is prescribed, there is no 
cremation for pahtas, nor anlije&h nor collection of bones, no 
shedding of tears and no pinda and no sraddha should ha per- 
formed for them. It is provided by Angiras quoted by Mit. 
on Yaj 111.6 that 'death results to evil-minded men from candslas 
(with whom a quarrel is purposely got up ), from water, from a 
snake, from a brahmana, from lightning and from animals 
that have sharp fangs (like tigers). If water and pinda are 
offered to suoh people (who die wilfully in these cases) they 
(water and pinda) do not reach them ana perish in mid ah.' 
These verses refer to death in a wrathful fight with tigers, 
snakes and the like or suicide in water through wrath or sorrow! 
But, if one died in water or by fire through inadvertence or 
negligence, then Angiras « himself provides that water should 
be offered and asauca should be observed. Long passages are

If an ahilaqni were killed by candalas in defiant fight 
with them or commits suicide, his corpse should be got cremated 
by efldras without proper mantras and Gobhilasmrti (Ht, 49-51) 
provides for the disposal of his srauta fires and sacrificial 
implements Though suicide was generally condemned, the 
smrtis (such as Atri 218-219) and Puranas allowed certain 
exceptions, viz. very old men (above 70), very weak men who 
cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or those who 
have no desire left for the pleasures of the senses or who have 
carried out all tasks and duties, may start on MakaprasthSita 
or die at PraySga Vide H of Dh vol. II pp 926-938 for 
detailed treatment of this topic If a man killed himself in the 
way allowed by the sastra then there was no blemish and 
asauca had to be observed and water and srSddha had to be 
offered. It may be noted that starting on Mahaprasthana and 
suicide on the part of old men by falling down from a precipice 
or in fire are forbidden in the Kali age. Vide H of Dh. vol, HI 
p. 939 and pp. 958-959 

The Mit on Yaj. IIL 6 quotes Vrddha-Yajfiavalkya and 
ChSgaleya to the effect that in the oose of those who commit 
suicide in any manner that is not sanctioned by the sSstras, 
Ksxayanabali should be performed one year after their death 
and then the rites of sraddha may be performed thereafter. 
The Mit. 681 onY&j. 1H. 6) relying on VisnupurSna describes 
the Narayanabali as follows On the 11th day of the bright 
half of a month, having worshipped Visnu and Yama. one 
should with the face to the south offer near them on darbhas 
with ends turned towards the south ten pmdas laved witto 
honey and ghee and mixed with sesame after bringing ic .mind 
the deceased ™ who should be looked upon as having fte ton

invite an uneven number of brahmanas, should observe a fast, 
should worship Visnu the next day, in the noon he should per- 
form all the rites from washing the feet of brahmanas up to the 
query about the gratification of the brahmanas (by the food 
served to them) according to the procedure of ekoddista 
siaddha, then he should silently go through all the rites from 
ullekkaivx (drawing lines) up to awmejana (anointing) by the 
procedure of Pinda-pitryajna He should offer four pindas to 
(images of) "Visnu, Brahma, Siva and Yaraa together with the 
attendants, should ramambar the deceased by name and gotra, 
should utter the name of Visnu and then offer the 5th pinda 
Then having gratified the brahmanas (after they have sipped 
water) with fee, he shonld bring to his mind one (of the brah- 
manas ) that is the most qualified of all as representing the 
deceased and having gratified him to the utmost with the 
gifts of cows, land and money, should then make the brah- 
manas that have pavitras on their hands offer to the deceased 
water together with sesame and should then take his meal along 
with Ms relatives. 

The passage quoted by the Mit. makes it clear that Nara- 
yanabali is meant only for those who commit suicide and is 
fobs offered one year after the death of the person guilty of 
suicide. The Haralata<* ( p . u%) also says the same and 
explains a verse of Visnu extending the performance of Nara-

After the ten pindas are oast in a river, there is taipana of the

The 5th class of exceptions to asauca rules comprises those 
that are declared by express texts as not liable tc i observe an 
Xauca Gautama (14.8-10) provides'* that (thesapindas) 
of those that met death for the sake of cows and brahmanas, ot 
those that met death through the wrath of the king and those 
that were killed in battle have to observe no asauca but only 
' sadyahsauca': Manu V. 95 and 98 state «* that (the sapindas) 
of those that are killed in a audden affray or by lightning or by 
the king (for an offence ) or of those that met death in protect- 
ing cows and brahmanas and of one who was killed in the 
fashion of ksatriyas in a battle by the sword have to observe no 
asauca, as also he whom the king desires (for his purpose) to 
observe no asauca. It is provided by Satatapa 6 ® that as 
regards a yati dying, his sons and other sapindas are not to 
offer water or pinda to him or to observe asauca for him. The 
Dharmasindhu (p. 449) says that this applies to all ascetics, 
whether they be Iridandm or ekadandm, hamsas or parama- 
Imnisas. So also on the death of a vanaprastha there is no 
agauca. Jsl the case of one who has performed his own sraddha 
while alive his sapindas have an option either to observe asauca 
or not. On the death of a brahraaoarin asauca is to be observed.

among brahmanas (i. e. as to brfihmanas killed in tattle) th 
usage of the hstas is different (i. e. aiauca is observed). 

Paraaara (IE. 12-13 ) provides that, if a man has gone for 
many years to a distant land and it is ascertained that he died 
there but the exact date of his death is not known, then either 
of three tithis viz. the 8th or 11th day of the dark half or the 
amaVasya should he accepted as the day of his death and water, 
pinda and sraddha should be offered on that date and the Far. 
M. I. 2 p. 237 adds that asauca also must be calculated from 
that date. On the other hand Laghu-Harlta says that if there 
is some obstacle at the time of a sraddha or when the date of 
death is not known, then the funeral rites should be performed 
on the 11th tithi of the following dark half (Suddhikaumudl 
P. 17) 

The digests lay particular emphasis on the fact that in 
matters of asauca the usages of a country must db__ observed. 
The Haralata (pp. 55, 205) quotes passages from the Sdipurana 
where special reference iB made to the authority of the usages of 
a country (desa-dharmapramanatvat ). The Suddhitattvap. ST» 
quotas 691 a verse of Marloi 'one should not disregard the manner 
of observing iauca and religious usages that are current m 
particular localities; the dharma is of that sort alone in those 
localities '. On p. 276 it quotes a passage of the Vfimanapurana 
to the same effect. 

It deserves to be noted that Daksa«» (VI 15) states tto* 
all rules about asauca apply when the times are «»£* 
peaceful but when a man is overwhelmed by distress there 
no (enforcement or application) of the (rules of) asauca, 

Visnu ( 19. 18-19) provides « that at the end of ^ P"»J

and honour brShmanas. Many medieval digests provide for a 
more elaborate procedure. For example, the SuddhikaumudI 
(pp. 155-164) sets out the procedure of the 11th day separately 
for the followers of the three Vedas. A. few salient points 
may be mentioned. After a bath for the whole body, the 
sapindas should touch a cow, gold, fire, durva, clarified butter 
and repeat the name of Govinda, then engage brShmanas to 
sprinkle santi water over them and say 'svasti*. If a brah- 
mana cannot be had one should himself perfoxm santi. The 
Haralata and others say that without santi water asauca is 
not completely removed. The followers of Samaveda should 
sing the Yamadevagana for santi or should repeat the four 
Vamadevya verses viz. 'kayanascitra,' 'kastvs satyo," 'abhl 
su nah' (No. 682-684 of the Samaveda) together with the last 
verse of the Samaveda ('svasti nalndro') preceded and followed by 
the sacred Gayatrl; these form the Santi mantras for Samavedins. 
For followers of Yajurveda seventeen mantras beginning with 
'ream vacam prapadye' and ending with *dyauh santih", 
preceded and followed by the Gayatrl form the santi mantras; 
the Rgvedins should employ for santi Jtg. X. 9. 4, VII, 35. l, 
V. 47. 7 &c. preceded and followed by the Gayatrl. Then some 
gold with silver as daksiua should be donated to a brahmana, 
then the VaitaranI cow should be donated, if one was not given" 
at the approach of death, then a gift of the bedstead &c. should 
be made. 

We have seen (p. 270) that originally the sutras (like San Sr ) 
and smrtis (like Manu) emphasized that one should not increase 
the number of the days of asauca and that men learned in the 
Veda and consecrating srauta fires had to undergo only one- 
day s asauca (Parssara DL 5, Daksa VI 6). But ultimately a 
flat penod of ten days of asauca (Manu V. 59) for all sapindas 
came to be prescribed. In the old days the means of communi- 
cation were very limited, and hence the news of abirth or death

can equal (much less surpass) the Dharmasastra writers in%e 
elaboraterukB evolved in booh, about asauca on birth an 
death. In these days when there is a State postal system and 
the means of communication abound owing to railways air 
mail, telegraph and wireless, the ancient and medieval rules of 
agauca are felt by all people to be most galling and tronble- 
some Mischievous people sometimes create trouble m the cele- 
bration of marriages by sending information about a death or 
a birth to persons against whom they have a grudge. Devices 
have to be employed for dodging the inconvenience due to rules 
of asauca. Tt is therefore necessary to introduce substantial 
changes in the rules about asauca that will prevent trouble, 
loss of time and work and would at the same time be more 
or less in agreement with the spirit of the dicta of the smrtis 
and the sentiments of most common people. At the end in 
the appendix note 693a is added which gives the text of the 
Asauca-dasaka with Sanskrit explanation. 

As regards fisauca on birth I would recommend that here- 
after in the changed set-up of society in these days one simple 
rule should bo observed, viz. it is only the mother that has to 
observe impurity for ten days and no one else has to observe 
impurity on birth. This is in general accordance with the 
ancient smrtis set out above. 

As regards impurity on death four rules should ordinarily 
suffice. 653 * 

( 1 ) Aiauca for ten days on death should bo observed by 
the father and the mother for the son and by the son for the 
parents, by the wife for the husband and vice veisa and by one 
who performs the rites of cremation and the rites after death. 

(2) For others (than the above) staying near the 
deceased as members of a joint family asauoa for only tbroo 
days should suffice. 

( 3 ) For all other relatives of the deceased whenever the 
news of death may reach them within a year after death, only 
a bath should be enough. 

(4) When the death occurred more than a year before 
the news reached the relatives not «ven a bath should bo 
required in the case of any relative except those mentioned m 
the first rule, who should be held «lean after a bath.

tomZL of days that she was to be unclean depended on 
whether the child was a male ox a female (Leviticus 12 2-5 ). 
t Sa 1 the ancient Aryans probably inherited their ideas 
about unoleanness on death and child-birth from thejr remote 
ancestors If one may surmise one can say this it must have 
been found out by the remote ancestors of the Vedic Aryans 
that i£ a person touched a dead body or used the clothes worn 
by the dead man when living, he also suffered from the same 
disease (particularly in the case of contagions diseases like 
plague, cholera, typhoid &c.) and that segregating such a 
person for ten days from other members of the tribe or 
community made the latter immune from the attack of such 
diseases. Therefore, those who touched the dead or carried the 
corpse for cremation or burial and the members of the family 
were thought to be unclean and were segregated for ten days. 
Gradually the ideas about the unoleanness on death and the 
necessity of segregation were made applicable to death due to 
all diseases or causes whatever. The unoleanness on child- 
birth might have been a case of extension by analogy derived 
from the ta&« on death At all events smrti writers put both 
on the same level (e. g. Manu V 61 "Just as impurity on death 
is ordained for ten days in the case of sapind&s the same holds 
good in the case of birth"). Rules about women in their 
monthly illness were prescribed as early as the Taj. S. and have 
been alteady dealt with in H of Dh. vol. H. pp. 802-805. 

"We have now to turn to the subject of suddhi apart from 
Uiauca. Suddhi of bdiavya means the 694 removal of a taint 
attaching to a thing and it is of two kinds, purification of the 
body and the purification of an external object ( Manu V. 110 
and Apaiarka p 253). It has already been seen (note 555

above ) how even the JJg. ]ays great emphasis on suddhi and 
being pure (suci). There are Vedie 655 passages laying down 
that the cups ( grahas) used in Jyotistonia and other sacrifices 
were to be cleansed with a strainer of wool, but not the camasas. 
In the Ait. Br. 32,4 it is provided that if the milk of an 
agnihotrm that was heated by him for the homa became impure 
( amedhya, by an ant or worm falling therein ), the milk is to be 
taken up in an agnihotrahavanl and was to be poured upon the 
ashes near the Ahavanlya fire. This shows that great care was 
taken about the purity of vessels to be used in sacrifices and 
about the offerings to be made &auca is one of the eight 
qualities of the soul {almagunas) mentioned by Gaut 8 24, Atri 
(verses 33, 35), Matsyapurana 52. 8-10, Brhaspati (q, by 
Apar5rka p 164 ). Haradatta on Gautama quotes a verse that 
sauoa is of four kinds viz. monetary purity, mental purity, 
bodily purity and purity in speech ; while Atri and Brhaspali 6K 
(q. by Apararka p. 164), aver that sauca is constituted by 
avoiding what ought not to be eaten, by associating (only) 
with those who are not censured (i. e. are not reprehensible) 
and by firmly abiding by one's own prescribed duties. Many 
works divide iauca into two varieties viz bahya (external) and 
antara or abhyaniara (internal). Vide H. of Dh volttpp 651-52 
for passages from Baudhayana Dh. S. (I 5. 3-4), Harita, 
Daksa and others defining and subdividing these. Agm37Z. 
(17-18) is the same as Daksa V. 3. The Vanaparva 200. 52 speaks 
of purity in speech, in actions and that brought about by water 
The Padma (II 66. 86-S7) emphasizes that it is the mental 
attitude that is the highest thing and illustrates it by saywfi 
that a woman embraces her son and her husband^ witti 
different mental states. There is an interesting passage »«» 
Lingapurana 8. 34-36 (not quoted there) which after stating

bath, that moss, fish and animals subsisting on fish are A ways 
tameraed in water, that in spite of that no one would call them 
pure that therefore one must always endeavour to secure inner 
purity and that one should bathe in the water of corr ec t know- 
ledge of the Self, apply once the sandal paste of faith and 
purify oneself by the clay in the form of desirelessness and 
that this is declared to he (the real) sauca. Mann V. 106 provides 
that of all kinds of purity mental purity is the highest, ne 
who is pure as to wealth (i. e. who does not deprive another of 
wealth by unjust means) is the (only) pure man and not he 
who is purified by water and earth. Visnu t». 89 is the same 
except that for wealth (.artha) it substitutes food ( anna ). The 
Trikandamandana (prakirnaka 31) has the same verse as Manu 
V. 106. Vide also Anus&sana 108. 1% (for purity of conduct, of 
mind," of a holy place, purity due to correct philosophical 
knowledge ) ; Brahmanda HI. 14. 60 (suciksma hi deva vai), and 
Yogaautra H. Z% (for sauca as one of the five niyamas). 

External purity of the body by various means (ringing the 
mouth, bath & c.) has already heen described in detail in H. of 
Dh. vol. II pp. 648-668. The ancient and medieval Indians 
insisted on a daily bath for all, recommended two baths ~ day 
in certain cases and three baths to a hermit and did not subs- 
cribe to the view of some of the early Christians, St. Agne3 
was canonized primarily for her refusal to bathe and St. Francis 
of Assisi considered dirt as one of the proper insignia of holy 
poverty. 698 . 

In srauta rites ( such as Agnistoma ) the sacrificer had to 
undergo a severe discipline of consecration ( or dlksa ), one item 
of which was the purification of the intending saorificer's body 
by the adlivaryu priest by rubbing the former's body twice with 
three bunches of seven darbhas each ( vide H. of Dh. vol IL 
p. 1136 ) Satatapa q by Sm. C. I p. 12*0, Suddhipr&kasa p. 147 
provide bath for one who has sexual intercourse with his wife 
during the period from the 5th to the 16th day after monthly 
illness begins, but for intercourse after these days the purifica- 
tion is the same as for urination and voiding ordure ; bath is 
also prescribed for vomiting after sunrise, after shaving, after 
a bad dream, on the touch of foul men ( such as candalas ).

out from crushing machines, actions (such as cooking) dona 
by women and children when they are impure (by walking 
barefooted on the road ) and are seen to he so, are still free from 
taint One's 707 own bed, garment, wife, child, water pot— 
these are free from taint for oneself, but these are impure to 
others. Sankha 16.15 is to the same effect 

Sankha 708 states that whatever removes the dirt (or pollu- 
tion) that is natural to a substance or arises from contact 
with another polluting substance must be declared to be its 
purifier. Sankba-Likbita m declare that the substances that 
bring about purification of all (polluted things) are water, 
fclay, the powder ( or paste ) of soap berries, bilva fruit, rice and 
mustard cake, salts (ashes), cow's urine and dung and that 
according to some when a substance is heaped up in a big mass, 
sprinkling with water. Manu Y. 118, Yaj. 1 184, Visnu Dh. S 
23.13 also provide that sprinkling with water is the mode of 
purification when large quantities of corn or clothes are pollu- 
ted, but when the quantity is small they must be washed with 
water. The quantity is said to be large when it is more than 
what one man can carry as a load (according to Kulluka on 
Manu V. 118).

IV J Purification of things 315 

Gaut. Dh. S. (1. 28-33 ) briefly deals ™>« with the purification 
of things as follows*. Purification of metallic substances (lite 
bell-metal), earthenware, substances manufactured from wood, 
cloth made of threads or yarn is brought about respectively by 
tubbing (or scouring) them, by baking in fire, by chiselling or 
planing, by washing in water; objects made of stones, jewels 
shells and pearls are purified by the same means as metallic 
substances; bones (ivory and the like) and mud (floor of houses) 
are purified in the same way as wooden substances ; and eartb 
(when polluted) is also purified by adding to it earth (brought 
from another pure spot ) ; ropes, chips of bamboos and reeds, 
leather are purified by the same means aa cloth or they may be 
abandoned when they are extremely polluted (as by the spilling 
of wine or urine or ordure). Vas (HL 49-53) has almost the 
same words, employing the word ' bhasmaparimar jana * (scour- 
ing with ashes and washing ) for * parimarjana '. The Up. Dh. S. 
(I 5, 17. 10-13) 711 provides: 'If one gets a used vessel only, 
he shall eat from it after having heated it thoroughly; a vessel 
made of metal is purified by being scoured with ashes and the 
like; a wooden vessel becomes pure by being scraped; at a 
sacrifice, vessels must be cleaned according to the precepts of 
the Veda.* Ta]. (IE. 31-34) states; time (lapse of ten days or 
a year as to asauoa), fire, religious rites (like Asvamedha or 
performing of sandhya), clay, wind, mind, spiritual knowledge, 
austerities (such as krcchra), water, repentance (in the case of 
sins), fasting— all these are the causes of purification. Gifts 
are the (main) cause of purification for those who do what is 
forbidden, flow of water in the case of a river, clay and water 
are means of suddki in the case of substances that are not clean, 
sannyasa (order of asceticism) in the case of the twice-born 
austerities in the case of those that have studied the Veda when 
they commit a sin (through ignorance), forbearance in the case 
of those who know the Self, water in the case of dirty limbs, 
silent rectal of Yedic mantras ( Japa > is the means of purified

according to several of the smrtis and digests. 

Certain foul things were said by the Smrtyartliasara p ?0 
to be the causes of extreme pollution and certain othere as caases 
of lesser or insignificant pollution. JFor example, excreii, 
urine, semen, blood, fat, marrow, liquor and intoxicants were 
the causes of great pollution; while dogs, Tillage swine, cats, 
their urine, the was from the ear, naite, phlegm, discharge from 
the eyes, perspiration are the causes of insignificant pollution. 

Baud. Dh. S. I 5 66 provides M3 that the purification of the 
ground is brought about by means of sweeping with a ( faulU 
less) broom, by sprinkling (cow's milk, urine oi water), be- 
smearing with cowdung, by scattering (pure clay on it) and by 
scrubbing away (or scraping ) some of the soil, when these are 
employed according to the situation of the ground and the 
particular impurity (of which it is to be purified ) BauiDh.

having holes) is purified by ploughing, ground wet (with im- 
purity) by covering it (with pure clay brought from elsewhere ) 
after removing the impure" thing Land is purified by means 
of four viz , being trodden undar the foot of cows, by digging 
it up, by burning (firewood or grass thereon), by pouring over 
it (water, cow's urine or milk &c. ) and fifthly, by smearing it 
(with cowdung) and sixthly, by the lapse of time. Vasistha 
HI 57 quotes a verse which mentions five means of purification 
almost in the same words as; those of Baudhayana (except 
the sixth viz time) Manu V. 12b mentions five means of 
purification, viz. sweeping with a broom, smearing with cow- 
dung, sprinkling, digging (and removing), the stay 'of cows 
thereon (for one day and night). Yiami Dh S. 23 57 adds 
daJia (burning) to the five of Manu Yaj. L 188 mentions seven 
means of the purification of the ground by adding daha (burn- 
ing) and kala (lapse of time) to the five mentioned by Manu. 
According to' 15 the "Vsmanapurana the ground is purified 
by digging, burning, sweeping, treading by cows, smearing 
of cowdung, scrubbing and by sprinkling water. Devala quoted 
by the Hit and Apararka on Yaj. I 188 gives a more elaborate 
treatment According to him polluted ground (bhTtmi) is of 
three kinds, viz amedhya ( impure ), dusta (soiled), and mahnS 
(dirty). Where a woman is delivered of a child or dies or is 
cremated or where a spot has been inhabited by candalas or 
where there are heaps of ordure and the like, ground that is full 
of foul things in this way is declared to be amedhya "« That 
ground which is polluted by the contact of dogs pigs asses 
camels and the like becomes dusta (soiled) and it becomes 
mates (dirty) by charcoal, h ask, hair, bones or ashes. Then

ground: 'Purity is of five kinds, viz. digging up, burning 
(with wood or grass), smearing (with oowdung), washing 
(with water) or the falJ of rain Even amedhya ground may 
be purified by these five means employed together (where a 
corpse is cremated or candalas dwell ) or by four (i e. omitting 
rainfall or burning in other cases of amedhya); ground that is 
dusta is purified by three ( digging up, burning and smearing 
with cowdung) or two (viz digging up and burning) and malma 
ground is purified by one (i. e. by digging up ). 

The Smrtyarihasara (pp. 73-74) provides that if an idol 
made of iron or other metal is slightly polluted (as defined 
above) then it can be purified by means of patlcagavya after 
rubbing it with ashes; similarly a stone idol, when slightly 
polluted, should be washed with water mixed with the clay from 
an ant-hill and becomes pure after being treated with paOcagamja. 
Any idol, if polluted with ordure, urine or village mud would 
become pure after first being flooded for five days with pafica- 
gavya, after being well washed with cow's urine, cowdung and 
clay from an ant-hill and by being again installed (with all 
installation rites ). Questions about the pollution of temples by 
the entry of the so-called untouchables or by the entrance of

IV ] Pollution of temples or idols 319 

purvSrdha pp. 351-52), the Dharmasindhu (HI p. 324) and 
other medieval digests provision is made for the re-consecration 
(punah-pratistha ) of an idol in a temple when the idol is polluted 
by the touch of candalas or wine or is burnt by fire or is denied 
by the touch of sinners or the blood of a brabmana " s If the idol 
he broken in two or more pieces or if it becomes broken 
(irregularly), if it be burnt or falls from its pedestal or be 
insulted, is without worship or is touched by an sss or the like 
animal, or falls on foul ground or is worshipped with the 
mantras of other gods,-in these ten circumstances Godhood 
ceases to indwell in the idol. K an idol he touched by robbers, 
candalas, patita people, by a dog or a woman in her courses or 
if it be polluted by the touch of a corpse re-consecration is 
necessary. 

The Yisnu-dharmasutra (23. 34 ) provides that idols when 
polluted should be purified in the same way in which the sub- 
stancs of which they are made (such as stone or copper &c.) is 
purified and then they should be re-consecrated. If the worship 
of an idol already consecrated is stopped for a day, two days, 
a month, or two months or it is touched by sudras or a woman 
in her monthly course, then at a proper time pupjshaoScana 
should be performed, an even nnmbeT of brahmanas should be 
fed, the idol should be submerged in water for a night and next 
day bathed with pailca-gavya from a jar full of it to the 
accompaniment of the respective mantras, then another jar 
should be filled with pure water and therein the nine kinds of 
precious stones should be cast, the jar should then have the

BecentlT after the attainment of Independence some of the 
"wnnmal legislatures in India have passed lavs (e g Boater 
Act 3d of 1947, G. P. and Bsrar Act 41 of 1917) throning open ail 
Hintfnpnblictemples to people who were once called untouchable 
This is not the place to discuss in detail the arguments for and 
against these measures. Many orthodox Hindus hold that their 
inmost feelings are hurt by this tyranny of the majority in She 
Legislature's. They feel that these measures are contrary to the 
fonr freedoms that are promised in many constitutions \lz. 
freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom fro-a want and 
freedom from fear. These measures are lilrely to be followed by 
serious consequences. It is felt that the younger generation novr 
being educated has hardly any faith in religion or in anything 
being sacred, that the so-called untouchables themselves when 
once they hare asserted their light of entering Hindu temples 
scarcely ever care to fregneni them and the orthodor Sindas also 
often cease to worship therein. There is the further fear that, if 
yeligious feelings eren when unreasonable according to progres- 
sive views could be trampled upon by the views of the majority, 
there is no knowing where the prosess would stop. Tiers would 
he temptation for the majority in a country to say that the sacred 
places of other religions should either not esist at all crhe 
opened for any one not belonging to the faith of the raino-ifcie?. 
B would have been far better that, while removing all ihe 
disabilities of the so-called untouchables &3 to employment, 
public places, courts and edncation, temples had been left alone

IV ] Water as purifier 321 

punishments and without bitterness and rancour in the hearts 
of many people. 

From very ancient times water has-been regarded as a 
great purifier. Rg. YE. 47 and 49 are hymns addressed to 
waters as divinities and they are there described as themselves 
pure and as purifying others (as in ]frg. VD, 49. 2 and 3 
'sucayah pavakah.'). Similarly Bg. X. 9 and 30 are hymns 
addressed to waters, in the former of which the waters are 
invoked to remove whatever sin or wrong one may have commit- 
ted (Bg. X. 9. 8 'idam-Spah pra vahata yat kinca duritam 
mayi') Atharva-veda I. 33 is a hymn" addressed to waters, 
wherein also they are described as * mcayah pavakah' ( in A. V. 
1 33. 1 and 4). The Vaj S. VX 17 ( closely following Bg. X. 9. 
8) invokes waters to remove whatever is censurable and dirty. 719 
In Yaj S. IV. 2 the sage prays 'May the Waters, our mothers, 
purify us I ' ™ The Sat. Br. I. 7. 4. 17 ( S, B. E. vol. 12 p. 213 ) 
states * water is a means of purification.' Visvarupa on Taj. 
L 191 quotes a long Vedic passage 721 wherein it is said "what- 
ever creates doubt (whether it is pure or impure) should be 
touched with waters; then it becomes pure." It is therefore 
that water (hot or cold) is said to be the purifier of various 
kinds of vessels and of the ground in Yaj. X 182-183, 188 
Manu V. 109, 112, 126. Gobhila (I. 31-32 ) 72 * lays down that 
when a man engaged in any religious rite hears a mantra 
addressed to the pitrs, scratches his body, looks at a man of the 
lowest caste, or allows the wind to escape from his intestines, 
laughs loudly or speaks an untruth, touches a cat or a mouse, 
or uses harsh language, has a fit of anger, he should perform 
acamana (ot touch water). 

According to Yaj I 187 and Visnu Dh. S. 23.56 a polluted 
house is purified by being swept and cowdunged. But more 
stringent rules were laid down if a dog, a sudra, a pattta, a 
mleccha or a candala died in a brahmana's house (vide note 
bdd above). After keeping the hou se vacant for the periods

stated in note 633, it is provided by Samvaria 7 * that a house 
that is polluted by the existence of a corpse inside it should be 
dealt with as follows; earthen pots and cooked food should be 
cast away and thrown out of the house which should then be 
smeared with cowdung and then a goat should be made to go 
.about in it smelling it and then the whole house should be 
sprinkled orer with water in which gold and laiias are put in 
by brahmanas rendered holy hy the repetition of the Gayatrt 
mantra; then the house becomes pure. Marlci prescribes K1 
that if a candala (merely) entered a house, it can be purified by 
.plastering it with cowdung, but if he were to stay m it loag, 
purification can be had only by heating it and making flamea 
of fire ltok its walls. 

The ground in a brahmana's house, in a temple, in a cow- 
pen should, says Yama, always be regarded as pure (unless it 
has been polluted). 

K great deal is said in the smrfcis and digests about the 
purification of water, £p. Dh. S. 1 5. 15. % says , » in a general 
way that a person after sipping water from what is collected

pure but when it is (stale owing to its being stored) for one 
night {or more) it should be thrown though it was pure (when 
originally brought). There 72B is no taint in water that cannot 
be agitated by any bBings and in the water of springs (that 
flow from hills). Tanks (that are so deep) that they cannot 
be agitated, rivers, wells and lakes (that are similar) should 
not be used by the usual way of descent (the ghat) if they come 
in contact with candalas and other impure persons or things. 
In Narhari v. Bhimrao, the Bombay High Court had to deal 
with the question whether a certain tank at Mahad in the 
Kolaba District could not be resorted to by untouchables for 
taking water and held that the untouchables were not prevented 
from using it (vide 39 Bombay L. R. p. 1395). 

^ Brhaspati provides that if in a well the dead body of an 
animal with five nails (man or beast) is found or if the well is 
otherwise extremely polluted all the water of the well should be 
taken out and the rest should be dried up by means of clothes, 
then if the well be built with burnt bricks flames of fire should 
be made (to lick the surface of the walls ), and then paflcagavm 
should be poured over when fresh water begins to flow in (from 
the springs)™ Spastamba (q. by SuddhikaumudI p. 299) 
states the circumstances when a well may be said to be extre- 
mely polluted: 'hair, excrements and urine, menstrual dis- 
charge, a dead body -when a well is defiled by these one should 
take a hundred jars of water from it' (and further purification 
by putting pancagavya in it should be resorted to if there is- 
raore water). Parasara VH. 3 says thesame about wells (with 
steps ), wells without steps and tanks.

thirsty travellers ) in a forest or from a jar placed near a well 
( for drawing water by any body ) or the water in ( a stone or 
wooden ) trough ( meant for all and sundry ) and water from a 
leather bag even though these may not belong to a sudra are 
unfit for drinking, but one may drink even such water as much 
as he desires when in distress. This shows that even in ancient 
times water was carried in leather bags or drums where there 
was scarcity of water and was allowed to be used even by 
twice-born people. 

We may now turn to the purification of meta]s and vessels. 
Baud. Dh. S.I. 5. 34-35 and I. 6. 37-41, Vasistha III. 58 and 
61-63, Manu V. 111-114, Yaj. I. 183 and 190, Visnu S3..2, 7, 
23-24, Sankha 16. 3-4, Smrtyarthasara p. 70 and others lay 
down rules about the purification of metals which do not agree 
in details. Therefore it is proposed to set out only what is said 
by Manu and one or two others. Manu (V. 113 ff.) says "The 
wise declare that the purification of metals (like gold) of 
precious stones (like emerald), of all articles of stone is brought 
about by ashes, water and clay. Articles of gold that are not 
smeared ( with dirty things like leavings of food &o. ) become 
pure by means of water alone; the same holds good of artioles 
that are found in water (coral and shells), that are made of 
atone and are made of silver on which no craftsmanship ( such 
as drawing lines or figures) has been expended. Gold and 
silver sprang forth through the union of wateT and fire; therefore 
their purification is brought about best by their causes, viz. 
water (in case of slight pollution) and fire (in case of 
extreme pollution). The purification of copper, iron, bell- 
metal, brass, tin and lead should be brought about by salts 
(ashes), acids and water according to circumstances (i e 
pollution oaused). Vasistha (HI. 58, 61-63 ) says : 'bell-metal 
is purified with ashes, gold and silver with water alone and 
copper with acids.' Yaj. I 190 says 'the purification of tin 
lead and copper is brought about by salt water, acids and 
ordinary water, of bell-metal and iron by ashes and water * The 
Lingapurana (purvardha, 189. 58) says: bell-metal is purified 
by ashes, won articles by salt; copper, tin and lead by aoids- 
golden and silver vessels are purified by water and jewels' 
stones, conches and pearls are purified -in the same way as 
metallic vessels. Vide Vsmanapurana (14. 70 ) which states that 
copper pots are purified by acids, tin and lead ones by salts 
bell-metal by ashes and water. Medhatithi on Manu V 114 



326 History of Dharmaiastra [Vol. 

qfuotos a verso 73S which. sayB 'vessels of bell-metal (or brassy 
when licked (or breathed over) by cows, in whioh sudras have 
taken their food and which have been denied by dogs and crows 
are purified by being scoured ten times with ashes (salts).' 
S&tStapa has a Bimilar verse (vide Far. M. vol II part 1 p 172). 

Elaborate rules are laid down about the purification of 
polluted pots and vessels used in ordinary life, in Baud. Dh. S. 
L 5. 34-50, 1 6. 33-42, Yaj. I 182-183, Visnu 33. 2-5, Sankha 
16. 1-5 and others. There is some variation in all these, but, 
as the Mit. on Yaj. L 190 remarks, it is not an absolute rule that 
copper must be purified by acids alone but if purification is 
possible by other means, they may be resorted to It is not 
necessary to set out the different modes of purifying vessels. 
A passage from the Suddhi-prakasa pp. 117-118 would be 
sufficient to indicate how this matter of patrasuddhi (cleansing 
of polluted vessels ) was dealt with in medieval India . " vessels 
made of gold, silver, conches, shells, stones, precious 
stones, boll motal, brass, tin, lead are purified by mere 
water, provided they have no dirt or pollution sticking to 
them if these vessels are polluted by the contact of 
leavings of food &c. they are purified by ashes and water or 
acids and water according as anyone of these is appropriate ; 
the vessels made of the above substances that are polluted for a 
!n«7ttoe owing to beingused by sudrasor owing to contac with 
Svin^of fool should first be scoured with salts (ashes) and

woman freshly delivered or by intoxicants or liquors becomes 
pure after being heated in fire; but if it is polluted several 
times then it becomes pure by being again manufactured. A 
vessel of bell-metal that is polluted by being frequently used for 
holding the water expelled from the mouth after rinsing it or 
the water in which the feet are washed should be buried in the 
ground for six months, then heated in fire and then it becomes 
pure ( compare Parasara VII. 24-25 ) ; but if it is polluted thus 
only once it becomes pure after ( being buried in the ground ) 
for ten days All metal vessels polluted for a short time by the 
bodily dirts such as urine, excrement, semen become pure after 
being placed for seven nights in cow's urine or in a great river; 
but if they are polluted as above many times or are polluted by 
the contact of a corpse, a freshly delivered woman or a woman 
in her monthly course they become pure after being thrice 
washed with salts, acids and water and after being heated in 
fire till they can bear it, but if these are polluted by urine and 
for a long time and frequently they become pure by being 
beaten into shape ( manufactured ) again. 

Visnu ( 23. 2 and 5 ) provides that all metal vessels when 
extremely polluted ( as stated in note 710 ) are purified by being 
cast into fire and that vessels of wood or clay when extremely 
polluted should be given up, but Devala 736 and others provide 
that wooden vessels when slightly polluted become pure by 
being planed or chiselled or by means of clay, cowdung or 
water and that earthen vessels if not extremely polluted 
become pure by being baked in fire 737 ( also Ysj. 1. 187 ). But 
Vas. m. 59 provides that an earthen vessel if polluted by the 
contact of wines, urinB, excrement, phlegm, tears, pus and 
blood is not purified even by being burnt in fire, ^s 

. Special ruleB are provided for the purification of vessels 
and implements used in Vedio sacrifices. Baud. Dh, S. ( I. 5.

Several rules were laid down about the purification of 
polluted corn and polluted ooofced food. A reference has 
already been made to the purification of heaps of corn Common 
sense, convenience and the Joss that may be caused by very 
stringent provisions are the considerations which prompt the 
rules on this subject. Visnu 23.35 provides '*> that where a 
heap of rice (or other grain) is polluted, one should throwaw3y 
only that portion of it whioh is actually defiled and should 
submit the rest to pounding and washing with water; cooked 
food that exoeeds in volume one draw and that has been defiled 
does not all become tainted, but that throwing away the defiled 
portion alone, one should sprinkle over the rest water mKad 
with gold on which the sacred GSyatrl verse has been repeated 
and should hold it before a goat to see it and should also bring 
fire near it. Vide Baud. Dh. S. I 6. 44-48. 'If grains of rice 
are polluted they should be washed and dried. But if it is a 
large quantity then sprinkling with water is enough; husked 
rice (if polluted) should he cast away. The same rule applies 
to cooked offerings. But in the C3se of large heaps of cooked 
food that portion whioh is polluted by dogs or crows should be 
cast away and the rest should be sprinkled with the Anuvali

IV] What is polluted food 329 

p av amlnah snvarjanah ' ( Tai. Br. I. 4 8 ). Gaut. 17. 9-10 pro- 
■ride 711 that one should not partake of food that was cooked 
along with hair and insects (like ants ), nor food that is polluted 
by the contact of a woman in her monthly illness, by a crow or 
by being struck with the foot (of some one ). But where food is 
already cooked and then it is smelt by a cow or it is polluted by 
the falling into it of hair, insects, flies, then Yaj. I 189 and 
Parasara VI. 64-65 provide that in order to purify it water, ashes 
(with water) or loose earth ( with water) should be cast over it. 
Ap. Dh. S. I. 5 16. 24-29 provide that one should not partake of 
food in which hair exists (i. e it was there from the beginning) 
or anything else (like nails ) that is impure or of food that is 
tonched with an unclean substance or in which an insect that 
subsists on impure things exists or food which is struck by the 
feet of any person or in which the excrement or the tail ( or 
limb) of a rat is found. 

The general rule is stated by Manu V. 118 which applies 
not only to corn and clothes but to many other articles viz. if 
there is a heap or a large quantity then sprinkling with water 
(proksana ) suffices for purification but if the quantity is small 
then washing with water is necessary. Manu V. 125 ( = Visnu 
Dh. S. 23.38) provides that (a small quantity of) cooked 
food part of which is pecked by birds (whose flesh is eaten by 
men), which is smelt by a cow, which is struck with the foot 
(by a man) and over which some one has sneezed or which is 
polluted by the falling in of hair and insects becomes pure by 
casting into it loose earth (and water). Parasara (VI 71-74 )

food and brahmanas should loudly reoite Vedic hymns (like 
the Pavamanasukta) over if; and then the food becomes fit for 
eating". The Suddhiprakasa explains that thB wealthy should 
not throw away food if it is more than a drona in quantity and 
a poor man if it is mora than an sdhaka 743 . 

Manu V. 115 «* says that in the case of all liquids (suoh as 
oils, ghee &o.) purification (when they are little in quantity) 
is brought about by means of two frusas dipped into them (or 
by straining them through a piece of cloth into another pot) 
and if the quantity is large then by sprinkling (water). Sankha 
provides 7 ' 5 that purification is brought about by mere proksana 
in the case of all exudations (Asafoetida &c), jaggery, salts, 
Bafflower, saffron and in the case of wool and cotton. Vide note 
705 above about certain articles being pure the moment they are 
transferred from the pots of even mlecchas &c. 

A. few words may be said about the purification of different 
kinds of cloth and garments and the materials of which they 
are made. Laghu-Ssvalayana (I 28-30) provides that a white 
garment is always commended for wearing (as a dhoU), but 
they are commended for wearing as upper garments and both 
are not defiled by the touch of anybody. Men may take their 
food or answer calls of nature while covered with both; trasara 
is nurified by being washed while a silken garment is always 
pure. Manu V. 130-121, Ya 3 I 186-187 and Visnu (33. 19-23) 
oroide almost in the same words that silken and woollen cloth 
is cleansed by saline earth (and with water and cows urine), 
Nepalese blankets by the powder of soap berry, clothes made of 
tree bark with Bilra fruit and linen cloth by (paste of white 
mustard. Vfemi 23. 6 says «« that when a garment is f xtremely 
Sited that portion thereof which when washed wjh water 
talk colour should be cut off. Sankha ™ quot ed by Visva- 

— i^vriTiTIf Dh. vol. in. p. 12* " e measnres of capac "'

IV] Purification of garments 831 

rfipa on Ysj. 1. 182 ptasoribas that garments are purified by being 
submitted to hot steam, by washing with water or by cutting off 
only that portion that is defiled. Parasara VH. 28 provides that 
garments made from bamboos and barks of trees, linen and 
cotton garments, garments of wool and birch bark are purified 
by mere proksana. 

The smrtis speak of purification of many other things, 
which is of little importance and is passed over here. Only 
a few illustrations are given here. Manu. V, 119 provides that 
skins and things made of split bamboos (or canes) are cleaned 
in the same way as clothes, while vegetables, roots and fruits 
are purified on the analogy of grain. Manu V. 120-121 state 
that the purification of conches, horns (of buffaloes and rams) 
and bones and tusks (of the elephant or boar) is to be caused 
in the same way as that of linen or with cow's urine or water 
and that grass, wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled 
with water. Visnu Dh. S. 23. 15, 16, 23 and Taj. J. 185 are very 
Bimilar. 

From the above it will be clear that purification of subst- 
ances depends on many circumstances, viz. whether they are 
metallic or are earthen, whether they are solid or liquid, 
whether a polluted substance is small in quantity or is a big 
heap, whether the pollution is extreme or insignificant and 
soon. 

Tn Manu the purification of substances follows (V. 110) 
the means of purifying one's own body. Purification "of the 
body by means of acamam and snana (bath) has already been 
described in H. of Dh. vol EL pp. 315-316 and 652-353 (about 
aoamana), 656-668 (about snSna). Purification by bath on 
asauca has already been dealt with before. Special rules were 
prescribed for women guilty of adultery (vide H. of Dh vol H. 

L rV VOl ^ PP - 647H549 >. aa also for women raped (vide 
vol DTp 575). SnSna (bath) with the clothes on was 
prescribed for purification of the body when a person touches 

Zn^l'lff ?• (nra 5 derer °* a toahmana &c), a caudsla, a 
woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a 
corpse or one who has touched a corpse; also when a man 
follows a funeral procession or touches a dog (vide Gaut. 14.

already been stated elsewhere ( in H. of Dh vol 1L pp 175-176) 
how the rules about touching untouchables were relaxed when 
people congregated in a temple or in a religious procession, at 
marriages and festivals and at holy places. It is said by some 
that this refers not to the so-called untouchables, but to nien 
who are untouchable owing to asauoa. But this is not correct 
The explanation of the Suddhi-kauniudI and Suddhiprakasa 
given below makes it clear that the untouchables are meant. 
In the first place, the words are quite genera] and not restricted. 
In the second place, there is no untouchability (except for the 
mother) on the ground of Jananaiauca and it is most unlikely 
that a person who has incurred mourning on death should visit 
a temple or go to a marriage or enter a religious procession, or 
festival. In the third place, looking to the several occasions 
mentioned together (particularly pilgrimages, battles, fire in a 
town or village and commotion or invasion of a country) it 
appears most unlikely that the verse refers only to 5S3iic3 on 
birth and death. 750 

The ancient and medieval Indians put very great emphasis 
on purity of mind, of body, of the place where they resided or 
performed religious rites, of the vessels used by them and 
of the ingredients of their food and worship. Many of lh» 
rules about purification of substances may appear to modern 
Linds as ve*y stringent; but it should no be forgot ten 
EfttT ancient Indians were imbued with he ttoojM 
that purity of the mind followed from purity of food

IV ] Reason of emphasis on purification 333 

(as stated in the Chandogyopanisad VIL 26.2 'ahgrasuddhau 
sattvasuddhih' and by Harlta). It would be Conceded that some 
of their rules about purification (such as about large quantities 
of corn or heap3 of cooked food) are based on conlnion sense 
and convenience. We are probably going to the other extreme 
in taking our food anywhere and in any surroundings.

CHAPTER IX 
f&ADDIJA 

^ This subject is of groat practical importance from several 
pointg of view. 

_ Tho Brahmapurana defines sraddha as follows- 'whatever 
is givon with faith to btthmanas intending it to be for the 
(bonofit of) pttrs at a proper time, in a proper place, to deserv- 
ing persons and in accordance with the prescribed procedure 
is called srfiddhaW The Mit on Yaj I 217 defines sraddha 
as abandonment with faith of an article of food or some sub- 
stitute thoroof, intending it for (the benefit of) the departed'. 
Tho Zalpataru on sraddha defined it as 'the giving up of sacri- 
ficial material intending it for pitrs and its acceptance by 
brfihmanas \ The Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara and the Sr3d- 
dhaprak-Ssa define srfiddha in the same way as the Mit. bat m 
r mora involved manner. Yaj. J. 268 ( = Agnipurana 163. 
40-41) states that the pttrs viz. Vasus, Budras and jldiiyas 
that are tho deities of srSddha, being gratified by sraddha, give 
gratification to tho ancestors of human beings. This verse and 
Mann HX 284 make it clear that the three ancestors of a man,

IV] Definition of irSddka 335 

viz. the father, paternal grand-father and the paternal great- 
grand-father are respectively to be identified with the three 
orders of superintending pUr deities, viz. Vasus, Rudras and 
Adityas, when performing sraddha. According to some," 1 
srSddha denotes three things, viz. hama, the offering of ptnda 
(ball of cooked food) and gratification of brahmanas invited to a 
dinner; the application of this word to any one of these three 
can only be in a secondary sense. 

A firm believer in the doctrine of kaima, punarjanma (re- 
incarnation) and karma-mpaka (explained above) may find it 
difficult to reconcile that doctrine with the belief that by offer- 
ing balls of rice to his three deceased paternal ancestors a man 
brings gratification to the souls of the latter. According to the 
doctrine of pwnarjanma (as very clearly and succinctly put in 
Br. Up IV. 4.4 and Bhagavad-gita 2»Z) 7 » foe spirit leaving 
one body enters into another and a new one. But the doctrine 
of offering balls of rice to three ancestors requires that the 
spirits of the three anoestors even after the lapse of 50 or 100 
years are still capable of enjoying in an ethereal body the 
flavour or essence of the rice balls wafted by the wind. Further, 
Yaj. t 269 (which is the same as Mark. 29. 38, Matsya-purana 
19.11-12, Agnipurana 163. 41-42) provides that the grand- 
fathers (i. e. pttrs) being themselves gratified (by the offerings 
of food in sraddha) bestow on men (their descendants) long 
life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, mo/tsa (final beatitude), 
all happiness and kingdom. In the Matsya-purana (chap 19 
verse a) a question is asked by the sages how food which a 
brahmana (invited at a sraddha) eats or which is offered into 
fere is enjoyed by departed spirits that might have assumed 
(after death) good or evil forms of bodies. The answer given 
(verses 3-9) is that fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand- 
fathers are identified with Vasus, Budras and Adityas 
respectively according to Vedic passages, that the name and

father has become a god (by bis good deeds) the food offered in 
sraddha becomes nectar and follows him in his state of godhood, 
if he has become a daitya (anasura) then (the food) reaches 
him in the form of various enjoyments, if he has become a beast 
then it becomes grass for him and if he has become a snake the 
sraddha food waits on him as wind (serpents are supposed to 
subsist on wind) and soon. Verses 5-9 of the Matsya, chap, 
19 are quoted as from Markandeyapurana by the Sraddha- 
kalpalata p. 5. VisvarSpa 7S * on Yaj. I 265 (p. 171 of Tri. ed.) 
also raises the same objection and gives several replies. One 
is that this is a matter entirely based on Nostra and so when 
sastra says that pitrs are gratified and the performer gets desired 
objects no objection should be raised. Another reply is that the 
gods Vasus and others that have access everywhere have the 
power to gratify pitrs wherever they may be situated. He does 
not call the questioners {riasUka) as some other and later 
writers do. 

The Slraddhakalpalata of Nandapandita 7sS (about 1600 
A. D.) enters upon an elaborate reply to these persons (whom he 
dubs atheists) that aver that the performance of sraddhas for 
departed fathers and the rest, who according ^to the particular 
actions of each go to heaven or hell or to other forms of exist- 
ence serves no purpose. He asks: why is sraddha useless? Is it

IV ] Does iraddha serve no purpose 337 

to perform it or is it because iraddha produces no consequences 
or is it that it is not proved that pit rs and the rest are gratified 
by iraddha? To the first he replies that there are such passages 
as 'therefore a wise man must perform sraddha with all his 
efforts* that lay down the obligation; nor is the 2nd objection 
proper, since Ysj. L 269 does declare the rewards ( of sraddha ) 
viz. long life &o. Nor is the third alternative acceptable. In 
the sraddha rites it is not that the mere ancestors named Deva- 
datta and the like are the recipients and that they are denoted 
by the words pitr, pitamaha and prapitamaha, but that those 
words denote them as accompanied by the superintending deities 
viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas. Just as by the words Deva- 
datta and the like what is denoted is not merely the bodies ( so 
named ) nor merely the souls, but what is denoted by the words 
is individual souls as particularised by the bodies; in the 
same way the words pit t and the like denote Devadatta and 
others together with the superintending deities (viz. VasUB, 
Eudras and Adityas ). Therefore, the superintending deities 
viz, the Vasus and the rest, being gratified by the food and 
drink offered by the sons and the rest, gratify those also viz. 
Devadatta and the rest and endow the performers (of sraddha ) 
with such rewards as male progeny and the rest. Just as a 
woman expecting to be a mother becomes gratified by partaking 
of the food and drink for which she has a longing in pregnancy 
and which is given to her by another person for the sustenance 
of the child in the womb, she satiates also the child in her 
womb and endows those that offer her the food and drink for 
which she has longings by bestowing on them some reward in 
return. Thus the pitrs denoted by the words father, grand- 
father and great-grand-father are the deities Vasus, Eudras and 
Adityas, and not merely (human beings called ) Devadatta and

IV I Theory of Sraddha examined 339 

any thing on their progeny. It appears very probable that the 
■worship of ancestors by means of sraddhas was a very ancient 
institution and that the doctrines of punarjanma and 
txtrmavipahi were comparatively later ones and that Hinduism 
being all-embracing retained the institution of sraddhas while 
adopting also the doctrine of metempsychosis. The institution 
ef sraddha is from one point of view an excellent one. It 
provides an occasion for remembrance of one's ancestors and 
relatives that -were dear and near when living The Aryasamaja 
objects to the institution of sraddha and interprets pitas in 
the Egveda as meaning living men in the Yanaprastha stage, 
ft may be noted that the tests support both views. The 
Sat. Br. expressly says that food is offered to the father of the 
sacrificer in the words 'this is for thee.' Yisnu Dh. S. 75. 4 
"He whose father is dead may put down a pinda for his father 
&c.* On the other hand ManuEL 384 states that fathers are 
spoken of as Yasus, grandfathers as Eudras &c and Yaj. I. 269 
provides that Yasus, Eudras and Adityas are the pitrs and the 
devatas of sraddha. These latter are to be explained as con- 
taining an injunction to contemplate upon the pitrs as Tasus, 
Endras &c. 

As stated below (p. 347) with regard to the Rgvedic passages, 
it was on account of the supposed power of pitrs to benefit or 
harm the living that the cult of the dead became a prominent 
feature in primitive societies. Offerings and ceremonies which 
may have in most ancient times been prompted in part at least 
by the desire to placate the ancestors are continued as tokens 
of pure affection and remembrance. Yarious beliefs about pitrs 
are mentioned^ in post-Yedic Literature. The Baud Dh S H 
8 14 summarizes a brshmana test stating that pitrs 'move' 
about m the form of birds. The Ausanasa-smrti and Devala 
ouotedby the Kalpataru say the same thing. IntheYayu- 
purana-ra it is stated that at the time of sraddha the ancestors

enter the brahmanas { invited ) after assuming an aerial form 
and that when the best of brahmanas are honoured with clothes, 
foods, gifts, eatables, liquids, cows, horses and Tillages, pitra 
become pleased. Mami DX 189 and the Ausanasa-smrti also 
support this notion that pitrs enter the invited brahmanas. 
The Matsyapurana (18. 5-7) enjoins: pindas should be offered 
to the departed for twelve days after death, since they serve 
him as food on his journey and give him great satisfaction. 
Therefore, the soul leaving the dead body is not taken to the 
abode of the departed for twelve days (after death), the 
departed spirit hovers near his house, his sons, his wife for 
twelve days. Therefore for ten days after dealh milk ( and 
water ) should be placed ( hung np ) in space for ten nights for 
reducing all torments ( or troubles of the departed ) and for the 
removal of the fatigue of the journey ( that the departed spirit 
has to make ). The Visnudharmasutra 76 ° ( 20. 34-36 ) provides 
"the departed spirit enjoys in the world of pitrs the food offered 
in sraddha with the utterance of the word 'svadha'; whether 
the departed is in the state of a god or in the place of torments 
( Hell ) or in the form of a lower animal or a human being, the 
araddha food offered by his relatives reaches him; when sraddha 
is performed, the performer and the departed soul both certainly 
secure vigour ( or prosperity )." 

The Brahmapurgna'" states that sraddha is to be treated 
of under five hea^.vis. how, where, when, by whom and with 
lafmaterials. But before proceeding to deal with these five 
htl »: b necessary to dilate upon the underlying ideas and

X.15.2 (translated above pp. 191-33, 194) and £g. IX.97.39.«*> 
'That Soma which becomes stronger and stronger and makes 
others strong, that is strained through a strainer, that flows in a 
stream, protected us by means of the luminary (the Sun) — that 
Soma with whose help our ancestors knowing the place ( where 
the cows were kept concealed) and the higher regions, harassed 
the mountain for (the sake of recovering) the cows,' In TJg. 
X. 15 1 the pitrs are said to be of three grades, lower, middling 
or higher. They are also said to be earlier and later 
ones ( $g. X. 15 2 ). They are all known to Agni, though 
all pitrs are not known to their descendants ( T?g. X. 15 13 ). 
The pitrs are divided into several groups such as Angirasas, 
Vairupas, Atharvans, Bhrgus, Navagvas and Dasagvas (Rg. 
X. 14. 5-6 ), the Angirasas being particularly associated with 
Yama who is invoked to come to the sacrifice along with the 
Angirasas (B,g. X. 14. 3-5). In Bg. I 763 62. 2 it is said: 
'through whose (Indra's) help our ancient ancestors (pitarah), 
the Angirasas, who sang his praises and who knew the place, 
found out the cows.' The pitrs called Angiras were, it appears, 
again subdivided into two classes viz. Navagva and Dasagva 76 * 
both of which words occur in Rg. T. 62 4, V. 39. 12 and X. 
62. 6. In several passages the ancient fathers are identified 
with the seven sages 7SS as in Rg. IV. 42.8 and VI 22. 2 and 
sometimes the Navagvas and Dasagvas also are said to be the 
seven sages ( Jig X 62 4 ). Angirasas are said to be the sons 
of Agni (Rg. X. 62. 5) and also of Heaven (Rg. IV. 2. 15). The 
pitrs are often said to regale themselves in the company of gods, 

762. This idea is at least Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-European. The 
ancient Parsi scriptures speak of Fravashts that were originally the same as 
pitrs of ancient Hindu works or the Manes among the ancient Romans. 
They were the everlasting and deiaed sonls of the dead Gradually the mean- 
ing ot Ftavashi -was extended and even Gods and objects like the Earth and 
the sky were supposed to have each a Fravashi. Vide S. B E. vol 4 p. 263

Fravashts, also S. B. E. vol 23 pp. 180, 184. 230.

of a cremated person to the pitrs (Bg. X 16, 1-2, 5= A V 18 
J .10 ,Bg X. 17. 3 ). In later works also (e. g. in Mark." chap,' 
45 ), Brahma is supposed to have created in the beginning 
four classes viz. gods, asuras, pitrs and human beings Vide also 
Brahmandapurana, Prakriya, chap. 8, and upodghata chap. 9. 
35 (ityete pitaro deva devSsca pitarah punah anyonyapitaro

It was supposed that the departed spirit, after the cremation 
of the body, was endowed with an ethereal body and became 
associated with Yama, the gatherer of departed men (Rg. X, 
14. 1 and 8, X. 15.14.X 16 5), and with pitrs. The departed 
spirit went to the world of the pitrs and Agni was implored to 
take the spirit to the world of the departed whose deeds were 
good and to the stride of Visnu (Jig. X. 14. 9, X 15. 3, X 16. 4 ). 

Although Tama iB said to dwell in heaven (dtvt) in Rg. X. 
64. 3, he is really a god of the middle region, as the Nirukta 
states. 767 The Atharvaveda states • 76s 'let us worship with 
obeisance the fathers and grandfathers of our father, that enter 
the wide middle regions, that dwell on the earth and in heaven.' 
In #g. I 35. 6 769 it is said there are three worlds ; two of them 
(Heaven and earth) are jn the lap of Savitr; one (i. e. the 
middle region) is in the domain of Yama where departed 
spirits congregate. 'The great Luminary (the Sun) has risen,

IV j The World of Pit™ 343 

it fa said that the pitrs dwell in the third world from this This 
means that after bhuloka and antai ikaa comes the piMoka. m 
the Br Up I 5.16 three worlds of men, pitas and gods aTe 
separably mentioned. In *» X. 135. 1-7, Yama is spoken of 
in somewhat different language. He is in this hymn men- 
tioned as a god by himself and not as the first mortal who made 
a path (Be. X. I*- 3) or as the gatherer of men (X U. 1) or as 
being in company of the pitrs In a few other places Yama. xs no 
doubt called rajan and praised in the same breath with Varuna 
(Bs X. U. 7). But such a position is very rarely mentioned. 
For the further development of Yama and his assistants as the 
punishers of men for evil deeds, vide pp. 159-160 above and 
notes 381-386. 

There is another division of pitas viz. pitarah somavantah, 771 
pitarah barhisadah, pitarah agmsuattah The latter two are ' 
named in Bg X15 4 and 11 (which occur also in Tai. S. H. 
6. la. 3). The &at. Br. defines these as follows. — "those that 
performed a soma sacrifice are pttarah somavantdh; those that 
offered cooked oblations (like caru and purodasa) and secured a 
world are pttarah barhisadah; those that did none of these (two 
actions) and whom fire consumes when burning them are 
'pttarah agnisvattah;' these are the only ones that are pttarah." 
The Tai. 772 Br. has a somewhat similar passage and the 
Kathaka Samhita IX. 6. 17 also refers to these three kinds of 
pitrs. Later writers introduced certain changes in the mean- 
ings of the words for the different classes of ptbs and also in- 
creased the number of the classes of pitrs. For example, the 
Nandipnrana q. by Hemadri states : the pitrs of brahmanas are 
called 'agnisvatta', those of ksatriyas 'barhisadah', those of 
vaisyas'kavyas", those of sudras 'sukalin' and those of mle-

(III. 193-198) mentions several classes of pilrs, connects 
pitrs called Somapas, Havirbhujah Ajyapas and Sukalins with 
the four vamas and in DX 199 states that the pitrs of brah- 
manas are designated as Anagnidagdha, Agnidagdha, Kavya, 
Barhisad, Agnisvatfca and Saumya Those verses of Mamt 
appear to summarize different traditions about the several 
classes of pilrs Vide Matsyapurana 141. 4 for the same last 
four names and 141. 15-18 for their definitions. In Sstatapa- 
smrti ( VL 5-6 ) twelve groups or divisions of pilrs are mentioned 
viz. pindabhsjah (three), lepabhajah (three), Nandtmuklws 
(three) and Airumukhas (three). This is a classification of 
pitrs from two different standpoints. In Vayu72.1 and 7360, 
Brahmanda (Upodghata 9 53), Padma V. 9 2-3, Visnudharmo- 
tfcara 1. 138 3-3 and other Puranas the classes of pitrs are raid 
to be seven, three of which are formless (amurhmat) and four 
have forms (muUimal) and they and their offspring arc des- 
cribed in detail. All this is passed over here. The Skond.v 
purana (VI. 216. 9-10) speaks of nine groups of pitrs, being Am- 
svSttah, Barhisadah, Ajyapah, Somapsh, Basmipah, Upahutah, 
those called 'ayantunah', Sraddhabhujah, Nandlmukhsh. In

(paflcajana mama hotram jusadhvam) and otheT passages, the 

Ait. Br. (13.7 or 3.31) explains that they are the five classes, viz. 

Gandh3rvas with Apsarases, pitrs, devas, sarpas and raksasas. 

The Mirukta. HL S partly follows this explanation and also gives 

another. In the Atharvaveda X 6. 32 the gods, pitrs and men 

are mentioned in that order. The ancient Vedic tests and 

practice make a sharp distinction between the Gods and the 

Pitrs. The Tai. S. VI. 1. 1.1 states: 'the gods and men divided 

the quarters, the gods took the east, pitrs the south, men the 

west and Rndras the north.' The general rule is that sacrifices 

for gods are begun in the forenoon, while the pitr-yajfia is 

performed in the afternoon ( San Br. X 773 The Sat Br. II. 4. 2.2 

narrates that the pitrs wearing the sacred thread over the right 

shoulder (and trader the left arm) and bending their left knee 

approached Prajapati, when Prajapati said to them 'you will 

have food at (the end of) each month (on the Amavasya ), your 

SLadha (cordial) will be swiftness of thought and the moon will 

ba your light,' while to the gods he had said that sacrifice will 

ba their food and the sun their light. The Tai. Br. m I 3. 10. 4 

appears tp make a distinction between pitrs who are of the 

nature and position of gods and pitrs that are more or less like 

human beings. 

The Kausika-sutra (1. 9-23) neatly collects in one place the 
difference in the procedure of the rites meant for gods and for 
pitrs. The performer of rites for gods wears the sacred thread on 
the left shoulder and under the right armpit, while in the case 
of the rites for pitrs it is worn on the right shoulder and under 
the left arm; the rite for gods is either begun facing the east 
or north, while that for the pitrs is begun facing the south; the 
rite for gods is finished in the north-east ( or north or east ), 
while that for the pitrs is completed in the south-west ; an action 
is done only once for pitrs, while for gods at least thrice or as 
many times as the tests direct; in going round (perambulating) 
the right side is turned towards gods and the left one in the 
case of pitrs; offerings are made to gods with the words 'svaha' 
and'vasat', while they are made to pitrs with 'svadha* and

bo that he may become a grown-up male * repeated when the 
wife of the performer of the sraddha eats the middle one 
out of the three pindas. It should not be, however, supposed 
that the element of fear of the pitrs is altogether wanting. 7S0 « 
For example, Rg. X. 15. 6 prays 'whatever fault we may commit 
in reference to you through our being ( erring ) men do not 
injure us for that.' In ]$g. III. 55. 2 we read ' May the gods and 
the ancient pitrs who know the place ( of the cows or the path ) 
not harm us here.' In Bg. X. 66. 14 it is said 'the Vasistnas 
praising the gods fashioned speech ( hymns ) like pitrs and 
like sages." Here pitrs and rsis are separate groups and 
Vasisthas aTe compared to both. 7806 

In many passages of the Vedic Literature the word 
pitaiah is applied to the three immediate deceased male 
ancestors of a man. ' Theref otb up to three generations they 
specify ( the ancestors ) by name ; for so many are the ones 
to whom sacrifice is offered' (vide n. 772 above ). The Sat.

concludes that it is really the father and the other ancestors

IV] Promulgators of iraddha rites 349 

From the sutra period ( about 600 B. C ) to the most modern, 
among medieval DhaTmagastra" works the authors wax eloquent 
over the praises or the importance or benefits of the institution 
of sraddhas. One of the earliest works among these, viz. the 
Ap. Dh. S gives the following interesting information: 783 
"Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. The 
gods went to heaven owing to sacrifices (i. e. as a reward of 
sacrifices that they performed), but men remained behind. 
Those among men who perform sacrifices in the same way 
as the gods did, dwell m the other world (i. e. heaven) 
with the gods and Brahman. Then (seeing that men lagged 
behind) Manu promulgated the rite which is designated by the 
word 'sraddha' and which tends to the salvation (or happiness ) 
of mankind. In this rite the Manes (pttarah) are the deities 
but the brahmanas (that are fed) are in the place of the 
aJiavaniya fire (in which in sacrifices to gods oblations are 
offered)". On account of this last sutra Haradatta ( com. of Ap. 
Dh. S.) and others hold that feeding the brahmanas is the princi- 
pal act at a sraddha. The Brahmandapurana (Upodghatapada 9, 
15. and 10. 99 ) speaks of Manu as the promulgator of sraddha 
rites and Visnupurana HI. 1 30, Vayu 44. 38 and Bhagavata 
in. 1. 22 designate Manu as Sraddha-deva. Similarly, in the 
Santiparva 345.** 14-21 and the "Visnu-dharniottara L139 14-16 
it is stated that the institution of sraddha was established in the 
Boar incarnation by Visnu and that Visnu should be regarded as 
dwelling in the three pindas offered to the father, grand-father 
and great-grandfather ¥rom this and from the passage of the 
Ap. Dh. S cited above we may infer that it was believed even 
several centuries before Christ that the institution of sraddhas 
had a hoary annuity behind it and that it was as old as Manu 
vm iTof n ? ankind according to the Rgveda (V1TI. 63. 1,

850 History of Dharma&Mra [Vol, 

JHiitagni), the MaliSpftryajna (poiformed in the Caturmasya 
called Sakamedha) and the rites called Astakss were known to 
the early Vedic literature. The word sraddha occurs in the 
Kathopanisad (1. 3. 17) 'whoever proclaims this highly esoteric 
doctrine in an assembly of brahtnanas or at the time of srSddha 
tends to secure immortality.' 786 The other early occurrences 
of the word sraddha known to me are confined to the sutra 
literature. The most reasonable and probable inference to be 
drawn from these facts is this that only a fe^ rites (mentioned 
just above) were known as related to the pitrs and that there- 
fore no need arose for a generic term in very ancient times to 
comprehend several rites for the pitrs. But when the number 
of rites in honour of ptlrs increased, the generic term 'Sraddha' 
was hit upon. 

A few samples of the panegyrics on sraddha may be 
set out here. The Baud. 787 Dh S. states that rites for the 
Fathers confer long life, heaven, fame and prosperity. The 
Harivamsa 7SS says 'the world derives support from sraddha 
and Yoga (i. e. Moksa) springs from iV Sumantu w 
quoted in the Smrticandrika (sraddha p. 333 ) states 'nothing 
else is declared to be more beneficial than Sraddha.' The 
VisnupurSna (JH. 14. 1-4) avers that if a man performs 
sraddha with faith he thereby propitiates Brahms, Indra, 
Rudra and the other gods, sages, birds, men, beasts, creeping 
animals, hosts of pitrs and whatever else is styled a being and 
the whole world. Y5j. I 270 *» promising long life and several 
other benefits arising from gratifying pttrs has already been 
quoted above (p. 337). Yama has a similar verse. It is said m a 
passage of the Visnudharmottara wl quoted by the Sraddhasara 
(p, 6) and SrSd dhaprakasa (pp 11-12) that thegtmte offered to the

great-grandf ather is declared to be god Vasudeva himself, the one 
to the grandfather is designated Sanfcarsana, that to the father 
is known as Pradyurana and the offerer of the pindas is him- 
self in the position of Aniruddha. In Santiparva 345. 21 it is 
stated that "Visnu should he looked upon as staying in the 
three pindas. In the Kurmapurana it is stated 'on the day of 
Amavasya the pitrs assuming an aerial form come to the door 
of their former haunt and mark whether sraddha is being per- 
formed by men of their family. This they do till sunset. 
When the sun sets, being oppressed by hunger and thirst, they 
become full of despair and feel sorrow, breathe heavily for a 
long time and go away condemning their descendants. The 
pitrs of him who does not offer sraddha on amavasya, even 
with water or vegetables, go away after cursing him '. 

It is necessary to say a few words about the derivation of 
the word ' sraddha '. That the word is derived from ' sraddha ' 
is quite clear. In the definition quoted above from the Brahma- 
purana and the definition 752 given by Marici and Brhaspati 
the connection of sraddha with sraddha is emphasized. In 
sraddha one entertains the firm faith or conviction that what 
is given up to the brahmanas for the benefit of the departed 
man or the Fathers will reach him or them in some way. The 
Skandapurana YL 218.3 says that Sraddha is so called because 
sraddha is the root (or mainspring) of that rite. This means 
that there is not only the conviction stated above but that there 
is a firm belief that a person is under an obligation to offer it. 
Sraddha is deified and addiessed as a deity in Rg. '» X. 151. 
1-5, the first verse of which is explained in the Nirukta (IX. 31). 
The word also occurs in Rg. n. 26. 3, VD, 32. 14, VIO. 1. 31 \ 
IX 113. 4. In some verses the two components of the word 
'sraddha' (viz. 'sraf and «dha') are separated without 
any change in the meaning For example, in Rg II 12 5 
(=A^.20.34.5) it is said "Have faith in him; O people 1 
he is Tndra'. In Bg. X 147. 1, addressed to Indra, we have « I

Astaka iraddha 353 



B has already been stated above (pp. 349-350) that in very 
ancient times there were only three rites for departed ancestors, 
viz.Finda-pitr-yaj5a (offered by those who had consecrated 
the grants fires) or monthly sraddha in the case of those 
who had not done so (vide e. g. Asv. Gr. IL 5. 10, Hir. Gr. IT. 10. 
1, Ap. Gr. YUL 21. 1. Yisnupurana IE. 14. 3 &c), the Mahapitr- 
yajfia and the Astaka srSddhss. The first two have been 
already described in vol. H. (as said above ), but the AstakS 
sraddhas have not been described at all so far. Therefore some 
remarks will be offered here about them. They are of special 
importance, but the authorities present great variations on 
almost all points such as the number of days and the months 
in which they were to be performed, the deities to be worshipped, 
the offerings to be made and the procedure to be followed. 

Gent. (YUL IS) mentions 'Astaka' rite as the first among

Astaka appears to have meant the 8th tit hi in any month after 
the FullMoonday (vide Sat Br. VI 4.2.10). The Sat. Br. 
states ™ 'On the 8th day (after full moon) he (the performer of 
agmcaham ) collects the materials for the fire pan, for sacred to 
Frajapati is the Sth day (after full moon) and sacred to 
Frajapati is this rite viz. the firepan.* Sahara in his Bhasya

in the Ap. M. F.IL 20. 27 as a mantra indicative of AstakS. The 
mantra is " May that ( Astaka ) night be very auspicious for us, 
whom people welcome like a cow coming towards a person and 
which is the wife of the Tear.' In the A. Y. EL 10. 8 the 
Eksstaks is said to have the year (Sarhvatsara) as husband.

Margasftsa, Pausa, Magha and Phalguna ). MoSt of the Grhya-

describes only; one Astaka. rite viz. the -Ekastaka in the dark 
half of Magha. The Bharadvaja Grhya H. 15 also speaks of 
only Ekastaka but adds that the 8th,of the dark half of MSgha 
on which the moon is in Jyestha ia called Ekastaka. According 
toHir. Gr. H. 14 and 15 the one Astaka extended over three 
days viz. 8th, 9th (on which a cow was sacrificed for. the p#r?) 
and 10th (which. was the Anvastaka). The Vaikhanasa-smarta- 
sutra (ed. by Oaland) IV. 8 says that Astaka is to be performed 
on the 8th of the dark half of Magha and Bhadrapada or on the 
7th, 9th or 10th tithi. 

There is divergence in the offerings also. The Kathaka 
Gr ( 61. S ), Jaimini Gr. 2. 3 and San. Gr. ( BI 12. 2 ) provide 
that on the three different Astakas the offerings are of cooked 
vegetables, flesh and apupad (cakes), while the Par. Gr. HI, 3 
and Khadira Gr JIL 3. 29-30 put apUpas for the first Astaka 
(and hence Gobhila Gr. HL 1Q. 9 designates it opSpSsfafts) and 
boiled vegetables on the last. According to Khadira Gr, Ht 4. 
1 a cow is sacrificed. According to Asv, Gr. H. 4. 7-10, Gobhila 
Gr. IV. 1. 18-22, Kausika 138. 2, Band. Gr. n. U, 51-61, on the

applied to a rite in which the piirs are the deities worshipped 
the greatest divergence prevails as to the devata of the Astaka* 
The Asv Gr. (E. 4. 3 and H. 5. 3-5) provides that on the 7th 
of the dark half the offerings are made to the pifrs and on the 
9th also, but Asv. II 4. 12 refers to the eight options as regards 
the deity of the 8th day, viz Visve-deiah ( all the gods ), Agni, 
Surya, Prajapati, Bstri (night), Kaksatras (constellations), 
the seasons, the Pttrs, Pasus (cattle). The Gobhila Gr HI, 
10 1 starts «« by saying ttat jffight is the detxda of Astaka, 
but adds that there are other views about the devata being Agni, 
the Pttrs, Prajapati, Rtus (seasons) or all Gods. 

The procedure of Astaka comprises three parts, viz. homa, 
inviting brahmanas for dinner (up to seeing them go away 
afteT dinner) and the rite called Anrastakya or Anvastaka 
"When the AstakSs were deemed to be three or four performed 
in the several months noted above, all these were gone through 
at each Astaka When the Astaka rite was performed only in 
one month i. e. after the Pull moon in Magha, the above parts 
were performed on three days, 7th, 8th and 9th of the dark half. 
"When compressed in one day only, they must have been per- 
formed one after another on the same day. 

Many of the Grhyasutras, such as those of Asvalayana, 
Kausika, Gobhila, Hirauyakesin and Baudhayana describe a 
very elaborate procedure in the case of Astakas One of the 
shortest being that contained in Ap. Gr. (TUT 21 and 82) is 
given here by way of sample s 080 . After defining Ekastaka 
(inYIU.21 10) Ap. proceeds: 'He (the performer of the 
Astaka rite) should perform subsidiary (or preparatory) rites in 
the evening of the previous day (i e. on the 7th of the dark half). 
He cooks (or bakes) a cake from rice taken up (from a heap) 
in four cups; according to some teachers the cake is prepared 
on eight potsherds (like a purodssa) After the actions up to the

The rest of the cake that is already baked is divided by him 
into eight parts and offered to the brahman as 8U . On the 
following day he prepares the cow for immolation by touch- 
ing her with a darbha with the words 'I make thee that 
are agreeable to the Fathers ready (for sacrifice)'. Having 
silently ( i. e. without uttering the word svalia ) offered five M2 
oblations of clarified butter, having cooked the omentum of 
that (cow) and having spread under (the cooked omentum) and 
sprinkled over it clarified butter he offers it with a palaia leaf 
from the middle or the end of the stalk with the next verse

with the flesh (of the cow) with the next verses (seven from A\p. 
M. P IL 20. 29-35 ). He offers the food of flour cooked (in milk) 
with the next verse (Ap. M P. 11.21. 1 'Ukthyascatiratrasca'). 814 
Then (he offers) the oblations of clarified butter with the follow- 
ing (eight) verses ( Ap. M. P. IL 21. 2-9 ). The rites from 
Svistakrt sts down to the placing of the pindas are the same as 
at the monthly srSddha (described in Sp. Gr. YHI 21, 1-9). 
Some teachers prescribe that the pvgdas are to be offered the 
day after the Astaka ( i. e. on the 9th of the dark half ). Here 
follows another method ( of celebrating the Astaka rite ). He 
sacrifices curds with his joined hands in the same way as he 
offers the cake. Having left over from the meat ( of the cow ) 
as much as may be required, he performs on the day following

(the,A9takS day) the Anvastaka.rite Its prooedureis explain- 
ed by the description of the monthly sraddha. 

Though Ap. Gr. (H. 5 3) and San. Gr. IE 13. 7 state that 
the Anvastakya rite follows the procedure of Pindapitryajna, 
some Grhyasfitras (such as Khadira DX 5, Gobhila IV Z-3) 
give very elaborate descriptions ,of that rife. The liv. Gr. and 
Visnudhamiasutra 74 follow a middle course. The description 
in Mr. Gr. is comparatively brief and,it is set out below. It 
may be noted that some Grhya-sutras state, that the Anvastakya 
rite is,performed,on the 9tft or 10th of the dark half (e. g, 
Khadira Gr UX 5. 1 'navamlm daSamlm vanvastakyam )'. 
Further, it may be stated that though most Grhyasuteas call 
the rite Anvastakya still it is also called, Anvastaka by Par. 
Gr. IH 3. 10, Manu IV. 150, Viamidhannasutra 74. 1 and 76. 1. 
The most notable peculiarity of this rite is that therein female 
ancestors are invoked and offerings are made to them of which 
liquor (sura), scum of boiled rice, collyrium, salves and garlands 
form part. Though some sutras (like 1st. Gr. H 5) declare 
that,the Astaka and Anvastakya are modelled on the monthly 
sraddha or Pindapitrywa, others (like the Baud. Gr. EL 13. 1, 
GpbhiU Gr. IV. 4„ Khadira III 5. 35) say that the Astaka or 
Anvastakya is the norm which is followed in the Pindapitrygjaa 
and all the sraddhas. The Kathaka Gr. (66. 1, 67. 1, 68. 1, 
69. 1) avers 816 that the first sraddha, the other srsddhas (such 
as'sapindlkarana), Pasusrsddha (in which the flesh of an animal 
is offered) and thesrSddha performed every month follow the 
procedure of Astaka.' The Pinda-pitrya]fia could be offered on 
amsvasya only by one who was ahttagm ( i. e. had kept the 
sacred vedio fires). Bis impossible to believe that everyone 
became ahitagni. The case was probably the reverse i. e. only 
a few became ahMgnis and the rest had only the grhya fire 
or many of the rest were without even the grhya fire, It 
appears possible that all were required to_ offer sraddha on 
amsvasya on the analogy of pindapitryajna. As the latter 
became rare, the requirement of offering sraddha on amavasys 
Z, a fri B d and in the sutras and smrtis all the details were 
"Sued under ma^ddha and in the case of the other

or variations of the masisraddha. Most of the details of the 
pindapitryaina ware required in masisraddha and a few ( such 
as giving arghya, gandha, dlpa ) were added and more elaborate 
rules evolved. 

The Anvastakya 817 is described in the £sv. Gr. (II. 5. 2-15) 
as follows r— Having prepared a portion of the same me'at, 8 * 8 
having established the fire on a surface sloping towards the 
south, having fenced it m and made a door on the north side 
of the enclosed shed, having strewn round the fire three times 
sacrificial grass with its roots without touching it, turning the 
left side (of one's body) towards the fire, he should place down 
the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice mixed with 
sssamum, rice cooked in milk, meal pap with curds and meal 
pap with honey. The ceremony should follow the ritual of the 
Findapitryajna (vide Asv. Sr. IX 6). Having sacrificed (part of 
the foods specified except meal-pap) with honey let him offer 
portions of those substances to the ptlrs and to their wives with 
the addition of liquor and the scum of boiled rice. Some place 
the portion to be offered into pits, which may be two or six. In 
those situated to the east he should present the offerings to the 
pitrs; in those to the west, to the wives. Thereby the cere- 
mony celebrated in the rainy season on the Magna day in the 
dark fortnight after the full moon of PrauSthapada (i. e. 
Bhadrapada) has been declared. And thus he should offer ( a 
festival like the Anvastaka ) to the pitrs every month, observ- 
ing uneven 8 ' 9 numbers. " He should give food at least to nine 
(brshmanas) or to any un-even number of brahmanas. (Food 
should be given) to an even number on auspicious occasions s 20

or on the performance of meritorious deeds; to an uneven 
number (on other oocasions). The rite is performed from left to 
right. Barley grains are to be used instead of sesamum. 

The Anvastakya rite was performed after each of the three 
or four Astakas and if only one Astakfi in Magna were perform- 
ed, then after the 8th of the dark half. 

There are two views about the rite called Maghyavarsa 821 
in Asv. Gr. H. 5. 9. Aoc. to Narayana, the rite is performed in 
the dark half of Bhadrapada for three days on 7th, 8th and 
9th, 8B The other view is that it is a rite like the Astakas but 
performed on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapada, when 
generally the moon is in the Magna naltsatra. There is doubt 
about the very name of the rite, as the mss. present various 
forms (vide Olderiberg's note in S. B. E. vol. 29. p 103 on San. 
Gr. IH. 13 1). The real name appears to be Maghyavarsa or 
Maghavarsa (meaning 'a sraddha in the rainy season when the 
moon is in the Magha nahsatia)'. The Visnu Dh. S 76 l aa 
mentions the following times for offering sraddha viz. (twelve) 
AmaVasyas (in a yeaT), the three Astakas, the three Anvastakas, 
the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapada when the moon is in the 
Magha asterism, the seasons of iarad and uisanta. In Visnu Dh. 
S (78 53-53) also a sraddha on the 13th of the dark half of 
Bhadrapada is highly eulogised Manu III. 273 also states that 
whatever food mixed with honey is offered on the 13th day in 
the rainy season when the moon is in Magha procures endless 
satisfaction. To the same effect are Vas XI 40 (in the ramy 
season and on Magha), Yaj I 26 and VarabapurSna. 8 * In the

Hir. Gr. 11 13. 3-4 (edited by Kirste) the name appears to be 
Msdhyavarsa KS and it is provided that meat is obligatory in it, 
but that if meat cannot be had then vegetables may be offered. 
In Par. 8M Gr. (JET, 3) the name (as printed) is madhyavarsa 
which is said to be a 4th Astaka in which only vegetables are 
offered. Apararka (p. 422) also appears to call the rite 'madhya- 
varsa.' In the Bhavisyapurana 827 (Brahma-parva), chap. 183. 4 
also this rite is referred to but it is said that therein meat is 
to be offered. It appears probable that this ancient rite on the 
13th of the dark half of BhSdrapads is a precursor of the 
Mahalayasr&ddha of later times. 

If iLsvalayana's view, viz. that there aTe four Astakas in 
Hemanta and fii&ira, were followed and if the Maghyavarsa- 
sr&ddha were to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of 
Bhadrapada as Naiayana holds, then there would be five Astakss 
in. all. Bhattoji in his Caturvimsatimatasangraha says so. 828 

Consideration^ of space forbid the comparison of the above 
procedure from Ap. Gr. and Asv. Gr. with the procedure 
described in the other Grhyas&fcras. It should be noted that 
several of the siitras often employ the same mantras in the 
various stages of the rite (as pointed out above in notes 
813-814). 

It must be said that the Astaks sraddhas gradually fell 
into oblivion and are not performed now. 

The foregoing discussion establishes that the monthly 
sraddha on AmavSsya was the model sraddha (prakrti) of

which the Astakas and other sraddhas were copies ( vikrtis ) 
with suitable modifications, though a few dissident texts 
reverse the position. 

In - the Gobhilagrhya (IV. 4. 3 ff ) another sraddha called 
'Anvaharya' is prescribed after the PindapitryajHa on the same 
day. The San. Gr. IV. 1. 13 appears also to describe the monthly 
sraddha as distinct from the Pindapitryajna. Mann (111,122-23) 
states : 'After performing the Pttryajfta ( i. e. pindapitryajna ) 
a brahmana who keeps sacred fires shall offer every month on 
the amgvSsya day the funeral sacrifice Pindanvaharyaka. 829 
The wise call the monthly offering to the Manes Anvaharya 
and'that mnst be carefully performed with' the approved kinds 
of "flesh mentioned below.' iTom this it appears that one who has 
consecrated the irauta fires ( i. e. an ahitagni ) was to perform 
the pityjapitryajfta. in the srauta fires and also perform the same 
day another srSddha after the pindapitryajna, while those who 
had not consecrated irauta fires were to perform on amavSsys 
a sraddha in the grhya ' fire, which was called pindanvahar- 
yaka or simply -anvaharya and also were to offer pindapitr- 
yajna in smarta fire (vide Sat. Srauta H. 7. 64 'grhyagnau 
anShitagneh"). Erom inquiries made I learn that nowadays 
most Agnihotrins (at least in the Deccan) do not perform Pinda- 
pitryajna at all or perform it only once a year and that no one 
performs the Pindanvaharyaka sraddha. It is further to be noted 
that insmSrtayajfias'no one now sacrifice^ an animal but 
employs instead mSsa grain and there are ahttagms who do 
not offer meat in Srauta sacrifices also, but only pista-paiu (an 
effigy of an animal made of flour ). 

The literature on sraddha is enormous in extent. Brom the 
Vedic Samhitss several thousand years ago up to medieval and 
modem commentaries and digests the various matters connect- 
ed with sraddha have been dealt with in more or less , detail. 
The PurSnas contain thousands of verses on sraddha. &n

an attempt here. All that can be attempted here at the most 
(and that too not in all cases) is to present matters chronologi- 
cally i. e, describe how sraddha was dealt with in the SarhhitSs 
and Brahmana texts, then in the comparatively older Qthya 
and Dharma sutras, then in such early smrtis as those of Manu 
andYaj., then in some representative Puranas, then in the 
early commentaries of Medhatithi, Vijnanesvara and Apararka, 
and then in the medieval digests. Even in this way only a 
skeleton of the ceremonies described in some representative 
work of each class can be exhibited. Many differences of 
detail which arose owing to lapse of time, the locality, the 
iakhQ and usages of each writer, his individual inclination and 
his ability, will have to be passed over altogether. In the days 
of the Purapas the differences in detail in the several sakhas 
have been adverted to. 8J *° Apart from the smrtis and passages 
of the MahabhaTata (Buch as Anusasana chap. 87-92) and com- 
mentaries on the SvLtras, on Manu, Yaj. and other smrtis, the 
digests on Sraddha are legion. Only the following digests 
(arranged in chronological order) have been laid under contri- 
bution in this volume: Kalpataru on sraddha; the Haralata and 
Pitrdayita of Aniruddha; theSmrtyartbasara; theSmrticandrika; 
theCaturvargacintamani (section on sraddha) of Hemadri (which 
in the B. I. edition covers 1716 pages); the Sraddhaviveka of 
Rudradhara; the MadanaparijSta ; the SraddhasSra (a part of 
Nrsimhaprasada); Sraddhakriya-kaumudI of Govind.ananda ; 
the Sraddhatattva of Raghunandana ; the Sraddhasaukhya 
(part of Todarananda); the Sraddhakalpalata of Vinayaka alias 
Nandapandita; the Hirnayasindhu ; the Sraddhamayukha of 
Nllakantha; the Sraddhaprakasa (part of Vlramitrodaya) ; the 
Sraddhacandrika of Divakarabhatta ; the Smrtimuktaphala (on 
sraddha); theDharmasindhn; the BalambhattI, a commentary 
on the Mitaksara. While presenting this exhaustive and hetero- 
geneous material, some generalisations, when called for, will

We Ehonld now turn to the several matters relating to 
§raddhas. 

First comes the question as to who are entitled to offer 
Srsddha (.irSddhSdhiMrin) This matter has been already 
dealt with in the H. of Dh. voL 3H. p 739 ff„ and on page 763 and 
on pp. 256-261 (notes 581-588) above. It would be noticed that 
some (like the Visnudharmasutra ) prescribe that whoever 
takes the wealth of the deceased should offer pin$as ( i. e. per- 
form srsddha for him), while others said that whoever was 
preferable as entitled to offer pindas to the deceased propositus 
was to take the wealth. A few matters not mentioned there 
may be added here. In the Santiparva 65. 13-21 it is narrated 183 
that emperor MandhStr was told by Indra how Yavanas, 
Kiratas and similar non-Aryan peoples (that are styled Dasyus 
in the Epic) are to be made to conduct themselves and it is 
stated that all dasyus may perform Pitryajfias (in which they 
should feed men of their own kind and make monetary gifts to 
them) and offer money to hrahmanas also. The YayupurSna 
(S3. 112) also speaks of the Miecchas as persons that offer 
oblations to Pitrs. The general rule is stated by the Gobhila- 
smrti ra that the husband should not offer pinda to his wife 
even if she dies sonless, nor a father to his son nor an elder 
brother to a younger brother. The moral of the story of Ninri 
who performed srSddha for his predeceased son and repented 
for having done so as it was dharmasankara is the same. Vide 
Anusiisanaparva 91. Apararka (p. 538) quotes a verse from 
Sattrimsan-mata that a father should not perform the sradaha 
of his son nor an elder brother of a younger one. But Brhat- 
parasara (p. 153) appears to state that even this general rule 
mav have to be set aside sometimes. Baudhayaua and 
Vrd"dha§Stttapa [a by 8m. 0. on Sraddha p. 337) allow a sradaha 
(eicept sapi ndfearanajto he performed b y any one for any

relative through affection, particularly at Gays. It is emphas- 
ized s32 that he alone deserves to be called putra, who, while the 
father is alive, obeys his words, and gives plenty of food ( to 
brahmanas ) every year (after his father's death) and who offers 
pindas (to his ancestors) at Gaya. The general rule laid down 
was that a child, whose upanayam has not been performed, is 
like a sudra and lacks authority to utter Vedic passages ( vide 
5p. Dh. S. H. 6. 15. 19, Gaut. H. 4-5, Vas. H. 6, Visnu Dh. S. 
28. 40, Manu IX 17S). 833 But an exception was recognized by 
almost all these authorities that a son, though his upanayana 
may not have been performed, can repeat the Vedic mantras 
required in funeral rites. Medh&tithi on Manu IL 172 explains 
that a minor son, even though not initiated into Vedic study 
by upanayana, can offer water to his father, perform the 
navasrSddhas (mentioned above in n. 593) and repeat such 
mantras as 'sundhantam pitarah' required in these rites, hut 
since he has no irauta or grliya fire of his own he can not per- 
form such sraddhas as the pwnxma. The SmityarthasSra 
(p. 56) provides that boys whose upanayana has not been per- 
formed, women and sudras should get sraddhas performed 
through a priest or they may themselves perform them without 
maufaas but only mention the name and gotra of the deceased 
or with the two mantras 'devebhyo namah' and 'pitrbhyah 
svadha namah.'. The above discussion shows that men and 
women, adults as well as children, those who are uparuta as 
well as those that are cmupanita are under an obligation to per- 
form Sraddha. 

Tai. SI 8 5. 1, Tai. Br. I 6. 9 (which will be quoted later 
on) show that sraddha was offered to three immediate ancestors 
father, grand-fatheT, great-grand-father. The Baud Dh S 
0. 5 113-115) states that there is a group of seven persons' 
closely knit together that is called avibhaktadSna sapindas viz 
great-grand-f ather, grand-f athsr, father, the man himself (who

offora pindas to the preceding three), his fall brothers, his son 
from a wife of tho same caste, the grandson and great grand- 
eon ; that sakulyas arc thoso that are called Vibhaktadayadas', 
that tho wealth of the deceased descends to those who are born of 
tho body of tho deeoased ««. Monu IX. 137 ( = Vas. 17.5 
«■ Visnu Dh. S. 15. 46) solemnly 835 affirms: 'by (the birth of) 
o son a man wins the worlds ( heaven &c. ), he secures immor- 
tality by a grandson and by tho grandson of a son he reaches 
tho abode of the Sun'. This verse shows that all the three 
descendants of a person confer equally great spiritual benefit 
on him. Ysj. also (in I 78) lamps the three together (without 
making any distinction between them) when he says 'since a 
man secures perpetuation of lineage and heaven by means of 
son, grand-son and great-grand-son'. Therefore when Manu 
(IX 106 ) says that by the birth of a son a man discharges his 
debt to his progenitors the DSyabhaga (XI. 34) explains that 
the word piifra stands for the three descendants up to the great- 
grandson, since all the three are entitled to perform the par- 
vana-sraddha and equally benefit the ancestors by the piudas 
they offer, and that the word pidra is not to be taken literally 
but only as illustrative in order to include the great-grandson, 
since one may with difficulty find a text expressly mentioning 
the adhtlaira of the grandson (as a performer of srSddha and 
taker of wealth) but there is no text expressly mentioning the 
great-grandson separately (as the taker of wealth and giver of 
pinda) ^ On Taj, It 50 which lays down that when the father 
dies or has gone to a distant country or is overwhelmed by 
calamities (incurable diseases or the like) bis debts should be 
paid by the sons or grandsons, 4he Mit. adds that even when 
a son or grandson receives no ancestral property the father's 
debts must be paid, the only difference being that the son has 
to pay the principal as well as the interest, while the grandson

has to return only the principal and has to pay no interest' 
and the Mit. quotes a verse of Brhaspati S7 where all the three 
descendants are mentioned in one breath and the Mit. adds that 
the great-grandson has not to pay even the principal if he has 
received no ancestral property. This last remark implies that 
the Mit. regarded that the great-grandson was also included in 
the extended sense of 'putra*. Taj. H. 51 begins by saying that 
whoever takes the wealth of a deceased person has to pay the 
latfcer's debts, so the great-grandson would have to pay the 
great-grand-father's debts if he received the assets of the 
grand-father. Therefore the Mit. on IT. 50 expressly mentions that 
a great-grandson need not pay his great-grand-father's debts if 
he received no assets, because, otherwise being included in the 
extended meaning of putra, he would have had to pay. There 
was no necessity to bring in or mention the prapautra under 
II. 50 if the Mit. did not include the prapautra in the word 
putra. Again on Yaj. II. '51 ( 'putrahlnasya rikthinah' ) the Mit. 
included even prapautra under the word putra. This shows that 
the Mit. is quits conscious that the three descendants of a man 
form one group and succeed to his estate and liabilities and putra 
includes three descendants wherever the context so requires. If 
the word 'putra' is n6t to be taken as only illustrative and as 
including both grandson and great-grandson, serious difficulties 
will arise even in the interpretation of Ysj. on which the Mit. 
comments. For example, in Yaj. H. 135-136 it is' Baid that 
when a sonless man dies his wife, daughters and tifcher heirs 
(named there) succeed one after another. If 'putra ' is taken 
to mean only * son ' and no one' else, then on the death of a man 
without a son his Wife or daughter (whoever is alive) will take 
the wealth even if a son's son exists. But that would be absurd 
and is not stated by any one. Therefore the word putra has to 
be interpreted in a wider sense in a proper context. Many 
.works such as the Vyavaharamayukha, the Vlramitrodaya, the 
Dattafcamlmansa interpret the word 'putra* as including three 
.generations. Therefore, though the Mit. in its remarks on 
inheritance and succession expressly names the son and grand-

son only (lit, it should have mentioned only the son) it must to 

token as including the great-grandson afeo, particularly h 

view of the fact that it refers to the great-grandson in iti 

comment on Y&j. 1. 50 and 51 as taking the riktha which thi 

Mit. (on Yaj. H. 114) interprets as aptratibandha daya. Baud 

Manu, YajSovalkya speak of the three descendants and Sankha 

likhito, Vas. XT, 39 and Yama employ s* 8 only the word pulra 

or sula in relation to the three ancestors. Therefore, the 

remark of Dr. Kapadia in 'Hindu Kinship' on p, 162 ' Vijfiane- 

svara understands hy the word putra sons and grandsons only 

is unjustified. It is impossible to hold with Dr. Kapadia thai 

the Mit. ran counter to the express dicta of renowned Smrtfe 

such as those of Manu, Sankha-Likhita and Puranas like the 

Visnu-purSna HI. 13.30 (quoted ahove in note 582) and that in its 

remarks on succession it forgot its own interpretation of putra 

on Yfij. II. 51. He has also not correctly understood the words 

of the Mit. introducing Yaj. H, 137 : ' sons and grandsons take 

the wealth; in their absence, the wife and others; thus it is 

said (by mo)'. This is wrong for several reasons. 'Wife and 

othors take the wealth' Ib said by YSj. (in H. 135-36). The 

following words are 'now (the author) declares an exception to 

both.' This clearly refers to Yfij. (tt 137) and not to Vijsane- 

fevara and so 'uktam* also mpst refer to Yaj. and not to 

Vijfisnesvara, Therefore, according to the Mit. the great-grand- 

son is included in the extended meaning of the word 'putra , is 

entitled just like a son or a grandson to offer sraddha (in default 

of a son or grandson ) and to take the wealth and pay the debts 

of the ancestor. In the matter of payment of debts there is, on 

account of the difference in the period that elapses, a Mbnow 

between all the three descendants if no ancestral wealth is left 

by the ancestor, viz. the son pays the debt with interest, he 

iandson only the principalis hut without interest and the 

Eeat-Sandson noting at all. This shows that even between 

the son and the grandson that are expressly ™mtoned by Yft 

k 50 as to the payment of debts there is a difference and that 

as the great-grandson had to pay nothing wto no ancestral 

property existed he was not mentioned at allinYaj. U.5U.

Just as the king is an ultimate heir and also the guardian 
of all minors, so he is like the son of a person (who has no 
relatives left) for performing sraddhas 

The nest question is about the times when sraddha is to 
be performed. It has been seen above (vide H. of Dh. vol. 
IT. p. 696 ft) that long before the time of the Sat. Br. five 
daily observances (called Mahayajfias) were prescribed 
for each house-holder, viz the sacrifice to beings, that to 
men, that to the Fathers, that to the gods and that to Veda 
The Sat. Br. and the Tai, A. (H.10) say further that this 
daily rite in which one offers siadha (food) to the Bathers 
even up to water was called pitryajfia. Manu DX 70 
defines pitryajila as tarpana (satiating ancestors with the 
offerings of water). Manu m. 82 provides that an householder, 
should daily perform a sraddha with food or with water or with' 
mOk, roots and fruits and thus please the Fathers. Sraddha 
originally meant a sacrifice performed for the Fathers on 
Am&vasya (vide Gaut. 15. 1-2 ).*»<* By applying that word to 
the daily ofiering of water to the Manes what is intended to be 
conveyed is that the special characteristics of sraddha in the 
strict sense are to be extended to this daily rite so far as 
possible. Amavasya is of two kinds, SinlvaU and Kuhii, Those 
who keep srauta fires should perform sraddha on the former, 
while those who have not kept srauta fires and sBdras should 
offer sraddha on the latter. 

Sraddhas are divided into three classes, nitua, naimithhz 
and kamya. An observance is called nvtya when it is laid down 
that it must be performed on a certain or fixed occasion ( such 
as every day, on an amavasya, or on Astaka day). What is laid 
down for being done on an occasion which is uncertain is 
catted .vamatdn ( such as the birth of a son ). What is ordained

non-performance thereof will lead to sinfulness. Passages 
mentioning the rewards that follow from the performance of 
obligatory ( nitya ) rites are only laudatory, they only convey 
that such performances make a man pure, but it is not meant 
that they are not obligatory and may be performed only if a 
person desires the rewards or results promised (i. e. such 
performances are not Mmya). 5p. Dh. S. (IE. 7. 16. 4-7) 
provides certain times for the performance of sraddha viz. that 
it must be performed in the latter half of every month, that 
the afternoon is preferable for it, that the last days of the 
latter half of each month are preferable to the first days of 
the latter half. Gaut. 15. 3 and Vas. 21 16 say that sraddha 
may be performed on any day of the dark half of a month after 
• the 4th day and Gaut. 15. 5 adds that if particularly appro- 
priate materials or particularly holy brahmanas are available 
or the performer is near a very sacred place ( such as Gaya ) a 
sraddha may be performed on any day. Kurma (II 20 23) says 
the same thing. The Agnipurana 115. 8 says that at Gaya a 
sraddha may be performed on any day ( na kalsdi Gaystlrthe 
tlaayat pindamsca nityasah). Manu (IH 376-378) provides that 
the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the 
10th but excepting the 14th 8386 are recommended for sraddha, 
that one performing a sraddha on even lunar days (i. e. on the 
10th, 12th) and on the even naksatras '(i. e. on Bharanl, 
RohinI &o. ) gains the fulfilment of all his desires, that one who 
worships the Manes on uneven days (11th, 13th &c ) and on 
uneven constellations (Erttika, Mvgasiras &c ) obtains pro- 
sperous offspring and that just as the latter half of a month is

preferable to the first half so the afternoon is preferable to the 
forenoon for the performance of a sraddha. Anusasanaparva 87. 
18 is the same as Manu HI. 276. Y&j. (I. 217-218), the Kurma ( H 
20. 2-8), Markandeya (28. 20 ff ) and Varahapurana 13. 33-35 
sum up in one place the times for performing sraddhas as 
follows: Amavasya, the Astaka days, lucky days (such as the 
birth of a son), dark half of a month, the two atjanas (the tioo 
days on which the sun appears to start towards the south or 
north i e. solstices), possession of sufficient materials (such 
as rice and pulse or meat ), the arrival of a worthy brShmana, 
the equinoctial points ( visuvat, i. e. the sun's apparent en- 
* trance into Aries and Balance ), the days on which the sun 
passes into one rait from another, the astrological conjunctions 
called Vyatlpata 8380 , Gajacchaya, eclipses of the sun and the 
'moon, when the performer has an intense desire to perform 
srSddha-these are times for performing sraddha. The Markan-

deya* 8 * (chap. 38. 22-23), adds that sraddha should be perform- 
ed when a man dreams an evil dream and when evil planets 
affect the naksatra of his birth. In an eclipse the appropriate 
time for sraddha is what is called 8pm ia Kala* 39 (i e. when the 
eclipse begins), as stated in a verse of Vrddha-Vasistha. The 
Brahmapurana (220. 51-54) contains all the timeB specified by 
Yaj. and a few more. Vide also Skandapurana VII. 1. 30-32, 
Visnupurana HI. 14. 4-6, Padma (srsti 9. 128-129). Ace. to 
Visnu Dh. S. 76. 1-2, Amavasya, the three Astakas and the three 
Anvastakgs, the 13th day of the dark half of Bhadrapada on 
which the moon is in MaghU, tfarad and Vasanta are obliga- 
tory (mfya) times for sraddha and that if a person does not per- 
form sraddha on these days he goes to Hell. VisnuDh. S. (77.1-7) 
states that the day of the sun's passage from one sign of the zo- 
diac to another, the two equinoctial days, particularly the sols- 
ticial days, Vyatlpata, the constellation on which the performer 
is born, a time of rejoicing (son's birth or the like)— these are 
liSmya times and a Sraddha performed on these occasions gives 
infinite pleasure ( to the Manes ). The Kfirmapurana (TJttarardba 
16. 6-6 ) says that sraddhas called kamya are commended on 
eclipses, solstice days, equinootial days and on Vyatlpata and 
they give infinite pleasure (to the Manes) and Sraddha per- 
formed on-Sankranti (sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac 
to another) is inexhaustible and so also on days of birth and on 
the several naksatras sraddhas should be performed. Ap. Dh. 
S. II. 7. 16. 8-22, Anusasana 87, Vayu 89. 10-19, Ya] I 262-263,

gets if he performs sraddhas on each of the days from the first 
to the 15th of the dark half These lists do not completely 
agree with each other. That of S.p. being probably the most 
anoient, is set out here — Sraddha performed on each of the 15 
days of the dark half respectively yields the following results

lead (on 11th), son possessed of cattle ( on 12th), many sons and 
many friends and handsome children which will die young 
(13th tithi ), success in arms (14th), prosperity ( on 15th i. e. 
Amavasya). Gargya (q by Par. M. I. % p. 324) provides that 
one should not perform sraddha onHanda, on IMday, on 13th 
of the dark half and on the naksatra of birth and the preceding 
and the following naksatras for fear of losing one's sons and 
wealth. The Nanda tithis are 1st, 6th and 11th. The 
Anusasana-parva (87. 16) provides that he who performs sraddha 
on the 13th tithi attains pre-eminence among his agnates, 
but then the young men in his house die as a consequence. 

The srgddhas performed on the days mentioned in Visnu 
Dh, S. 77. 1-6 are nanmtiika and those performed on certain 
tithis and days of the week for securing certain rewards would 
be mmya sraddhas. According to Par M. I. 1 p. 63 the per- 
formance of obligatory (nitya) actions is samskaraka (i e 
offects a purifying change in the mind making it fit for higher 
things ), while in some oases it may also produce the desire to 
know the Reality behind the appearances (i e. it is 'vividisa- 
janaka as indicated by the Glta 9. 27 ). Jaimini ( VI 3 1-7 ) 
establishes .the proposition that the mtya acts (such asAgni- 
totra, Darsa-pfirnamasa-yaga ) must be performed even though

tively secure happiness ( or admiration by people ), victory in 
battle, all desires, such learning as he desires, wealth and long 
life. The Kurma ( II. 30, 16-17 ) also expatiates on the rewards 
for sraddhas on the several days of the week. 

The Visnu-DharmasQtra ( 78. 8-15 ) mentions what rewards 
follow from performance of sraddhas on the 28 naksatras from 
Erttikato Bharanl (including Abhrjit which is placed after 
TJttarSsadha and before Sravana). Yaj I 265-368, Vayu 
chap. 82, Markandeya-purana 30. 8-16, Kurma (TL20 9-15), 
BrahmapurSna 220. 33-42, Brahmanda ( TJpodgh&tapSda 18.1 ff) 
aJso deal with the same topic, but all these works do not present 
complete agreement For example, Visnu Dh S. and Yaj. 
agree that sraddha performed on Erttika, EohinI, Asvinl and 
Bharanl yield as rewards heaven, offspring, horses and longe- 
vity, but they disagree in several others e. g. while Visnu says 
that prosperity, beauty (or happiness) and all desires are 
obtained by performing sraddha on the Pusya, Aslesa and 
Magba naksatras respectively, Yaj. provides that a sraddha 
on these three yields strength, son and eminence. The Anu- 
sSsanapaTva 89 and VsyupurSna 82 set out the rewardB of 
sraddhas on the several naksatras from Erttika as declared by 
Yama to Sasabindu. 

*" It is stated in the Agnipurana m that sraddhas performed 
at a holy place and on days that aje called Yugadi and Man- 
vadi yield inexhaustible gratification (to the pttrs) The 
Visnupurana «*, MatsyapurSna (17. 4-5), Padma Y. 9. 130-131, 
Varahapursna and Prajapati-smrti verse 22 and Skanda VD. 1.

the 9th of the bright half of Eartika, the 13th of the dark half of 
Bhadrapada and 15th tithi of the dark half of Magha are called

sraddha performed during an eclipse satisfies the Manes as

376 History of Bharmaiaslra [Vol. 

Very learned disquisitions are held in Apararkap. 465 ff, 
Hemadri p. 313 ff and other writers and digests as to the mean' 
iftg of aparWim which is the time for sraddha prescribed by 
Manu ( in. 378 ). There are several views. Some hold that the 
part of the day after noon is ' after-noon.' The word ' purvShna ' 
occurs in Rg. X 34. 11. Others relying on a sruti«* test 
The forenoon is for gods, mid-day for men and afternoon for 
pifcrs ' hold that the third part of the day divided into three parts 
is aparahna.' A third view is that aparahna is the 4th part of 
the day divided into five parts and they rely « 5 on Sat. Br. II. 
2. 3 9. The five parts are called pratah, saAgam, madhyandina 
(or madhyahna), aparahna and sSyGhna (or sayam or 
astagamana). The first three are expressly mentioned even in 
the Bgveda V. 76. 3 Prajapati-snirti (verses 156-157) says that 
each of these five parts extends over three muhuitas (the day 
being divided into fifteen muhurtas). It further states that 
hidapa is the 8th muhurta from sunrise and that sraddha should 
be begun in ktUapa and should not last beyond Rauhina muhurta 
and that five muhurtas (from 8th to 12th) are the maximum time 
for sraddha. M6 The word kutapa has eight meanings as noted by 
the Sm. C. (sraddha ) p. 433 and Hemadri on sraddha p. 320. 
The word is derived from 'fcu* meaning 'condemned' (i. e. sin) 
and 'tapa' means 'what burns.' The eight 8 * 7 meanings of 'kutapa* 
are 'midday, a vessel of rhinooeros horn, woollen seat or blanket

The general rule is that sraddhas are performed in the afternoon 
(butthis applies to sraddha on New moon, Mahalaya, Astaka 
and Anvastaka sraddhas ), while Vrddhisraddha and sraddha in 
which only corn is offewd (amasraddha) are performed in the 
morning. Medhatithi on Manu IE. 245 quotes a smrti text on 
this 8 " The Trikandamandana (H 150, 162) provides that when 
it is not possible to perform a religious rite at the time 
prescribed for it as appropriate, it should be performed at some 
other time thereafter and that, between the proper time of a rite 
and the means, the former is to be preferred and one should 
not wait for a time later than the proper one with the desire of 
being able to collect all the principal materials. 84Bo 

A. few words must be said about the proper places for the 
performance of a sraddha. Manu (HI 206-207 ) lays down that 
the performer should make efforts to secure a spot sloping to 
the south and smear it with cowdung, a spot that is pure and 
unfrequented ( by many persons ) and that the Fathers are 
pleased by sraddha at naturally clean spots or the banks of 
rivers and spots that are unfrequented. Yaj. I. 227 very briefly 
puts the requirements by saying that the place of sraddha should 
be covered on all sides, should be pure and sloping to the south. 
Sankha says : ta * one should not perform sraddha on the backs 
of bulls, elephants and horses, nor on raised earth platforms nor 
on land owned by others ' The Knrmapurana states 830 'Forests, 
sacred mountains, holy places, temples — these have no (definite) 
owner and they cannot be private property (of any one)'. 
Yama provides 851 * if one offers sraddha to his pttrs in spots

belonging to others, that sraddha rite is destroyed by the 
pitrs of the owner of those spots. Therefore, a man should 
perform Sraddha on holy spots, on river banks, in sacred 
places and particularly in land belonging to himself, in bowers 
near hills and on mountain tops' The Visnudharma-sutra 
chap 85 mentions numerous holy places and then adds 'in 
these and other ththas, big rivers, on all natural sandy banks, 
near streams, on mountains, in bowers, forests, groves and spots 
that look charming because of being smeared with cowdung 
( sraddha may be performed ) * Sankha ( 14 27-29 ) states 
'whatever is given in holy Gaya, in Prabhasa, Puskara, 
Prayaga, in the Naimisa forest (on the SarasvatI), on the 
banks of the Ganges, Yamuna, Fayosnl, on AmaTakantaka, on 
Narmada, in Benares, in Kuruksetra, Bhrgutunga, on the 
Himalaya, on Sapta-VenI, on Jtsikupa — all that becomes inex- 
haustible.' The Brahmapurana ( 220. 5-7 ) also specifies river 
banks, lakes, mountain tops, sacred spots like Puskara as the 
proper places for sraddha. The Vayupurana, chap 77 and 
Matsya 22 contain long lists of sacred places, countries, moun- 
tains in relation to srSddhas. The Kalpataru ( sraddha p. 40 ) 
and Sr. P. p. 147 state that special characteristics of the tlrthas 
in the several countries that are declared to be fit places for 
sraddha should be understood from the inhabitants of those 
various countries. 

Sacred places will be dealt with in a separate section 
(on Hi Urns). 

The Visnudharmasutra 85 J (chap 84) presciibes that 
siaddha should not be performed in Mleccha country, nor should 
one go to a Mleccha country and then defines a Mleccha 
country as one in which the system of the four tnnnsu not

twelve yojanas in extent and which is to the north of the river 
Makaiiadl and to the south of Klkata (i.e. Magadha) is 
not fit for sraddha, similarly the countries called Karaskara, 
Kalinga, the country to the north of the river Sindhu and all 
countries where the system of varnas and asramas is not in 
existence should be sedulously avoided for sraddhas. The 
BrahmapuraBa(220. 8-10) makes the somewhat startling remark 
that the following countries should be avoided for sraddhas 
viz. the Kirata country, Kalinga, Konkana, Krimi(Krivi'), 
DasSrna, Kumarya (Cape Comorin), Tangana, Eratha, the 
northern banks of the Sindhu river and the south bank of 
Narmada and the east of the KaratoyS. 

The Markandeyapurana 8S * prescribes that for a sraddha a 
place (ground) that is full of insects, that is arid, ot is burnt 
by fire, from which proceed sounds that are painful to the ear, 
that is terrific in its aspect, that emits fetid smell should be 
avoided. 

It was also provided from very early times that certain 
persons and animals are to be ejected from the place where 
sraddha is to be performed and are not to be allowed to pollute 
the sraddha rite by looking at it or by disturbing it in various 
other ways. Gaut. (15. 25-28) provides that food seen by dogs, 
candalas and those guilty of mahapatakas becomes unclean 
(and so unfit); therefore one should offer sraddha in a covered 
( or screened ) place ; or he should strew round about the place 
sesame or a worthy brahmana who purifies a row of diners by 
his presence should perform a santi for removing the taint 
caused (by a dog or candala seeing the food &c). 5p. Dh. S. 
prescribes that the learned condemn the seeing of a sraddha by 
dogs and those who (being pahta) are excommunicated and 
that a leper, a bald man, one having sexual intercourse with 
another's wife, the son of a brahmana who follows the profes- 
sion of arms, the son of a brahmana woman from a sudra man — 
if these eat sraddha food they pollute the diners sitting to eat 
in a row. Manu ( HL 339-242 ) states: *a candala, a village 
pig or cock, a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, an impotent 
person — these should not be allowed to see brahmanas engagec 
in taking dinner. Whatever is seen by these at a homa

being fed, or at a religious rite (like the Darsa-Purnamasa 
sacrifice ) or at a sraddha becomes fruitless. A pig taints food 
(offered to gods or Manes) by merely smelling it, a cock by 
sotting in motion tlie air with its wings, a dog by casting a 
glance and a man of low oaste by touob. If a servant of even 
the person who offers sraddha is lame or squint-eyed or has a 
limb less or more (i. e. having eleven or nine fingers &c), be 
should be ejected from the place where sraddha is to be per- 
formed.' It is provided by the Anusasanaparva (127.13) that 
sraddha food should not be seen by a woman in her monthly 
illneBS or by a sonless woman or by one suffering from whito 
leprosy. Vi9nu-dharmasutra ( 82. 3 ff ) contains a long list of 
about 30 persons who are not to be allowed near a sraddha. 
The Kurmapurfin a (II. 32. 34-35) states that one devoid of a 
limb, a paMa, a leper, one suffering from an open ulcer, an 
atheist, a cook, a pig, a dog, should be kept far away from a 
sraddha; one should also avoid one that has a disgusting 
appearance, an impure person, one who is naked, a mad man, a 
gambler, a woman in her monthly course, those that wear 
indigo-colourod or yellow-red garments and those who follow 
heretical views. The Markandeya 33 20-24, Vayu 78. 26-40, 
Visnupurana HI. 16. 12-14 and Anusasanaparva 91 43-44 also 
contain long lists which are passed over here. The Skanda- 
purana VI 217. 43 also speaks about a dog, a woman in Her 
monthly illness, a paMa and a hog not being allowed to see the 
iraddha rite.

pati quoted in the Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara mentions five 
olasses of sraddhas as declared by Manu viz. nitya, naimittika, 
kamya, Vrddhi and Parvana 8SS . The Sraddhaviveka remarks 
that the sixteen pretairaddhas (to be described later on) are 
included under naimittika and that such sraddhas as Gosthl- 
sraddha enumerated in other sinrfcis are included in Parvana. 
The KiirmapurSna (H 20. 26) similarly speaks of the five 
sraddhas as enumerated by Manu 657 . The Mit. on Yag. I. 217 
states that there are five sraddhas, viz. * ahar-ahah-sraddha, 
parvana, vrddhisraddha, ekoddista and sapindlkarana. Tho 
daily sraddha is described by Manu III. 83 ( * Sankha 13 16 
and Matsya 16.4) as one that is performed every day with food 
(cooked rice, yavas &c.) or with water or with milk, fruits 
and roots. Two verses of Visvamitra 858 quoted by several works 
speak of twelve kinds of sraddhas, viz. nitya, naimittika, 
kamya, vrddhi-sraddha (performed on the birth of a son, 
marriage or similaT incident of good luck), sapindana (sapindl- 
karana), parvana, gosthlsraddha, suddhisraddha, karmanga, 
daivika, yatrasraddha, pustisraddha. Explanations of all 
these are quoted from the Bhavisyapurana by the same works. 
Sapindana and Parvana will be described below. Some of the 
rest not already defined may be briefly explained as follows :

comes enthusiastic owing to a talk about sraddha or when many 
learned men gather together at a sacred place and, finding it 
impossible to have separate cooking arrangements for each, 
pool their resources for collecting sraddha materials and 
perform simultaneously sraddha for the pleasure it affords to 
themselves and for the gratification of pitrs The Suddbi- 
sraddha is one where brahraanas are fed when a person under- 
goes iuddh ( purification ) after being guilty of some sin or 
transgression ( it is a subsidiary act in a prayascitta ) That 
sraddha is called 'karmsnga ' which is performed at the time of 
the Qaibhadhana rite or at the performance of a soma sacrifice, 
or at slmantonnayana, pumsavana ( it is like Vrddhisraddha). 
That is called daivifca sraddha which is intended to propitiate 
gods ( it is like nityasraddha and is performed on the 7th or 
12th t tthi or the like with sacrificial food ) When a man going 
to a distant country on a pilgrimage or the like performs a 
sraddha in which clarified butter is served ( to brahmanas ) in 
abundance or when he comes back to his house, that is ystrs- 
sraddha. That is called pustisraddha which is performed for the 
health ( or fattening ) of the body ( when taking some medicine 
for the purpose ) or for the increase of one's wealth. Out of 
these ** twelve the principal ones are parvava, el^oddista, irddh 
and sapnufana. There are works called San-»avati-sraddha such 
astboseofSivabhatta, son of Govinda, and of Eaghunatba.

tlie 12 amavasyas in the year, the four sraddhas on the Yugadi 
days (note 841 above), the fourteen sraddhas on the 
Manvantaradi days (p. 375 above), the sraddhas on 12 
snhkrantis (i. e. the sun's apparent motion from one sign of the 
Zodiac to another), the 13 sraddhas on the Yoga called Dhrti 
( i. e. Vaidhrti ) and the 13 sraddhas on the .Vyatipata yoga, the 
16 Mahalaya sraddhas, the four Anvastaka days (according to 
Xsv. as noted on pp 359-360), the four Astaka days and the four 
days (i e. 7th of dark half of the months of Hemanta and Sisira) 
of the day previous ( to the Astaka ). These classifications and 
enumerations of sraddhas will afford an idea how the doctrine 
of sraddhas was carried to an exaggerated extent in the course 
of centuries. It goes without saying that only a few people 
could have indulged in the luxury of so many sraddhas a year 
and most people were content with the performance of only one 
Mahalayasraddha and one or two more. It may be noted that 
Manu (in. 122) first prescribed that on the amavasya of each 
month an elaborate sraddha should be performed, but knowing 
that this was almost impossible Manu recommends to all (HL 
281 ) that an elaborate sraddha should be performed on three 
amavasyas in one year 862 (viz. in Hemanta, Grlsma and Yarsa ) 
and one should perform every day the sraddha which is one of 
the five daily sacrifices (HE. 82-83). Devala went further and 
recommended that an elaborate sraddha may be performed only 
once a year. 

The next important question is about the qualifications of 
the brahmanas that were invited to dinner on a sraddha day. 
Only brahmanas were and are entitled to be invited for sraddha

dinner whoever may be the performer of the sraddha. In this 
connection many works contain high eulogies of brahmanas, 
hut they are passed over here, as the eulogy of brahmanas has 
been already dealt with at some length in H. of Dh vol, II. pp. 
37-38, 135-138. It may be noted that the grhyasfitras contain 
a few requirements, but as we proceed the smrtis and puranas 
go on adding qualifications and enlarging the lists of those that 
should not, be invited. For example, the 3iv. Gr 8 «"IV. 7. 2, 
San.-Gr. IV. 1. 2. Ap. Gr VHI. 31. 2, Ap. Dh. S. H. 7. 17 4, Hir.

r provide that the brahmanas to be invited should be possessed of 
Vedic learning, should be of excellent character (free from 
anger and passion and possessed of control of mind and senses) 
and of meritorious conduct, pure, not deficient in a limb or not 
having an excessive hmb (e. g. having six fingers). TheAp. 
Dh S states that he who has studied the three Vedic verses in 
which tbe word 'madhu ' occurs ( Rg I. 90. 6-8, Vaj. S 13 27-29, 
Tai, S. IV. 2. 9 3 ), he who has studied the Trisuparna, one who 
is a Trinaciketa, one who has studied the mantras required for 
the four sacrifices ( Asvamedha, Purusamedha, Sarvamedba 
and Pitrmedba ) or who has performed these four sacrifices, one 
who keeps the five fires, he who knows the Saman called Jyestha, 
he who carries out the duty of daily Vedic study, the son of one

IV] Who should be invited at iraddha 385 

who has studied the Veda and is able to teach the whole Veda 
with its enigas, a Srotriya — these persons sanctify the company 
if they eat at a funeral repast. Gaut. 15. 28, Baud. Dh. S. IL 8.2, 
Manu HL 185-186, Yaj L 219, VarahapuiSna 14.2 contain almost 
the same words about those who sanctify the company of diners 
( i. e. who are panHipat ana ). The Anusssanaparva {90. 25-3 1 ), 
Kutmapurana XL 2L 1-14, Matsya 16 7-13, Brahmapurana 220. 
101-104, Vaya 79. 56-59 and 83. 58-55, Skanda VL 217. 21-25 
give long lists of panMipavana brahmanas. The Hir. Gr. n. 10.2, 
Baud. Dh. S. H 2. 7, Emma (H. 21. 14) and others say that a 
performer of sraddha should invite one who is not a relative 
connected by marriage (such as a maternal uncle) nor one who is 
of the same gotra, nor one who is connected with the performer 
by Teda study (i. e. is his teacher or pupil), nor a friend nor one 
who expects monetary help from the performer. Manu (IU. 
138-139) provides that one should not invite at a iraddha 
dinner a personal friend, that one may gain a friend by making 
valuable gifts to him (on other occasions), that one should 
feed at a iraddha a brshmana whom he does not deem either 
his friend or foe and that he who performs sraddhas and offer- 
ings to gods chiefly to gain friends reaps no reward after death 
by those sraddhas or offerings. But Manu HL 144 ( = Kurma 
H 21-22) provides that one may invite even a friend but not a 
fire though the latter may be learned. Manu (2H. 135-137 and 
145-147 ) lays down that the main or best rule to be followed is 
to present sraddha food to those who are devoted to spiritual 
knowledge, that between a man who has studied one whole 
recension of the Teda but whose father was not a srotriya and 
one who is himself not a srotriya but whose father had studied a 
whole recension of the Veda (i. e. whose father was a srotriya) the 
latter is the more worthy of the two, that one should strive to 
feed at a sraddha an adherent of the Bgve da who has studied 
one entire recension of that Veda or a follower of the Vajurveda 
who has studied one Sakha thereof or a singer of samans who 
has finished one recension of the Ssmaveda and that if one of 
these preceding three is honoured and dines at a sraddha the 
ancestors of the performer will be gratified up to the seventh 

Sraddha p. 392 and Kalpataru on sr. pp. 66-67) describes the 
^ahficatwns of those who are pahkteya brahmanas viz they

-"cs J, must be endowed with learning ( of six kinds ) and ilia

(character of 13 kinds) and good conduct (of 16 kinds). Sankha- 
Likkita m give a long list of pankteya (fit to be associated with 
in a paiikti i. e. tow of diners) brahmanas, viz he who knows 
the Veda and the Vedangas (viz. phonetics, kalpa or srauta 
ritual, grammar, Nirukta, metrics and astronomy); one who 
keeps the five fires ; one who has Btudied the Yeda with its 
angas; one who knows Sankhya, Yoga, TTpanisads and Dharma- 
sastra; a srotriya, a trinSciketa, trimadhu, trisuparnaka and 
one that has studied Jyesthasaman; one who has studied 
Sankhya, Yoga, "Opanisads and Dharmasastra; who is devoted 
to Yeda; who always keeps sacred fires; who is obedient to his 
parents and devoted to Dharmasastra. Similar rules are laid 
down by Visnu Db. S 83, Brhat-Parasara p. 150, Vrddha-Gau- 
tatna p. 581, Prajapati verses 70-72, Laghu-Satstapa verses 99- 
100, Ausanasasmrti ( Jiv. vol X pp. 523-524). As Medhatitbi K * 
on Manu HI. 147 Bays the gist of all these passages is that a 
learned brahmana who has studied the Yeda, whose conduct is 
good, whose family is famous, who is the son of a srotriya 
father and who is not related to the performer must be invited 
and all the rest is mere arthavada (by way of eulogy). Manu 
(IIL 128) laid down two propositions viz. all food offered as 
sacrifice to the gods and manes must be given only to a brah- 
mana who studies the Veda and that whatever is presented to 
the most worthy brahmana (among brahmanas studying the 
Veda) brings in the greatest rewards. Then Manu (10.183) 
declares that pahUtpavana brahmanas are those that sanctify 
a row of diners among whom sit some who are tainted by 
(latent ) blemishes that make them unfit to be among the diners. 
Then Manu QH. 184-186) gives examples of panktipavana brah- 
manas viz. those who are the foremost among students of all 
the Yedas or their expository works and who are born _m a 
family of unbroken descent of Yedio students who are Tnna- 
tfa£ te Hemadri (on fc. PP. 391-335) and Ka pataru (sr. pp. 
64-60) quote numerous verses from Tama on pantopamm.

132-146, but adds that if it is not passible to secure suob a 
brahmana then the next best course 865 ('anukalpa') may be 
followed, viz. the performer may invite his own maternal grand- 
father, his maternal uncle, sister's son, father-in-law, his 
teacher of the Veda, daughter's son, son-in-law, a bandhtt (such 
as mother's sister's son), wife's brother or a sagotra, or his 
family priest, or his pupil. Similar provisions occur in Yaj I. 
230, Kurma (TJttarardha 21, 20), Varahaputana 14, 3, Matsya 
16. 10-11, Visnupurana m. 15. %-i (anubalpesvanantaran). But 
Manu is caieful MS to point out in a later chapter that one 
who is able to observe the best course, but observes the 
second best does not reap other-worldly .rewards by his 
actions. Even £p. Dh, S. 567 expressly says that if strangers 
do not possess the requisite qualifications, then even one's 
full brother possessed of all the qualifications (as toVedic 
learning, good conduct &c.) and pupils may be fed at a 
sraddha. Baud. Dh. S. also allows even a sapinda to be fed. 838 
Gaut 15. 20 appears to be of the view that even pupils 
and sagotras may be invited when they are possessed of 
excellent qualities and strangers -with good qualifications are not 
available. Even in these times very learned brahmanas are un- 
willing to be fed at a sraddha, particularly within a few years 
(three or five) from the death of the person for whose benefit 
the sraddha is to be performed. Smrtis attach a certain stigma 
to the fact of being the recipient of a sraddha dinner and 
prayasoittas are prescribed. 1"ot example, the Mifc. on Yaj. 3IL 
289 quotes several verses of Bharadvaja, one of which says 
'If a brahmana dines at a parvana sraddha he has to perform 
six pranayamas (as expiation), if he dines at a sraddha from 
the third month after a person's death to one year, he has to 
undergo a fast; if he dines at a vrddhisraddha, he has to per- 
form three pranayamas, and a fast for a day and night if he 
dines at a sapindana sraddha.' The Mit. further quotes a

(189. 12-13) provides that if a brahmana dies while the food 
offered to a preta is still in his stomach he dwells fo T a lalpa 
in a horrible hell, becomes a raksasa and then becomes free 
from the sin. 

According to Gaut. 15. 10 young persons with the requisite 
Qualifications are to be preferred to older ones, while, according 
to some, young men were to be invited at a sraddha for one's 
deceased father" and old men for a sraddha for one's grand- 
father. On the other hand, Zp. Dh. S. says among brahmanas 
possessing the same qualifications, the older ones are to be 
preferred and among those that are old are to be preferred 
the poor that are anxious to earn money. 86So 

Some of the works lay special emphasis on inviting ascetics 
or yogms at a sraddha dinner. The Visnu Dh. S states that 
yogins 869 are particularly pafikttpavcmu and quotes a stanza 
as recited by the pitrs ' May ( a , descendant ) be born in our 
family who feeds a brahmana yogin at a sraddha by which we 
are ourselves satisfied.' The Varahapurana 14. 50 says that a 
yogin is superior to 100 brahmanas. The Markandeya-purana 
provides 'a wise man should always feed yogins at a sraddha 
since the pitrs rely for support on Yoga; if a yogin is fed by 
being seated as the first among thousands of brahmanas he 
Baves the performer and the other diners as a boat saves men 
in water.* Then it quotes stanzas sung by the pitrs (29. 32-34) 
to king Aila. The Saurapurana, after mentioning the qualifica- 
tions (in 19. £-3 ), 870 winds up by stating that even one may 
suffice provided he be a single-minded devotee of Siva (verse 6)

jyi Who should be invited at sraddha 389 

The Matsyapurana (16. 11-12) recommends *He who 
expounds (the meaning of) texts; he who enters npon the 
discussion of srauta sacrifices and he who knows the rules 
about the accents of samans is a purifier of panktipavanas; 
one proficient in the Samaveda, a Vedic student, one 
endowed with knowledge of the Veda or of Brahma 
— where these are fed in a sraddha it yields the highest 
benefit.' "^ Though in the above passages the greatest 
emphasis was laid on the possession of Vedic learning by the 
brahmanas to be fed, one had also to see whether they were 
men of good character and observers of the rules of proper 
conduot, as provided by Asv. Gr. IV. 7. 2 (note 862), Gaut. 15.9 
and Manu It 118 who says 'a brahmana m knowing only the 
sacred Gayatrl but living a well-regulated life is to be 
preferred and not one who knows the three Vedas but who 
is not well-regulated in conduct and who eats anything 
(even forbidden food) and who is a vendor of everything.* 
The Skandapurana VT. 217. 27 recommends that one should 
make every effort to know the family of the brahmanas, 
then their character (slla), then their age and then the 
facts about whom they marry or to whom they give their 
daughters in marriage. The Brahmanda (Upodghata, chap 
15) says tbat there should be no scrutiny of a brahmana 
about whom nothing is known because siddhas (yogins) roam 
about on the earth in the form of brahmanas. But if faults in 
a brahmana aTe easily seen or if one knows his disqualifica- 
tions on account of one's dwelling near him, he should not be 
invited (verses 5-6). The same Purana (Upodghata 15. 24-26) 
arranges the orders of preference as follows ■ first yati (ascetic), 
then a brahmana who knows the four Vedas and itihasa, 
then one who knows three Vedas, then one who knows two 
then one who knows one Veda, then one who is an 
upadhyaya- Hemadri (on sraddha p. 443) quotes the Agni- 
purana 873 as follows: 'what is the u se of (birth in a) famous

family if the man is himself devoid of good conduct ? Are not 
insects found in fragrant flowers?' Jstukarnya says 'one 
flheuld not honour even with a word (much less with food &c.) 
in rites for gods and Manes bad brabmanas void of good 
eonduct, even though they be endowed with learning and be 
born in a good family.' This insistence on worth was due to 
the conception that pitrs assuming an aerial form enter 
brabmanas at the time of STSddha, Vide BrahmandapurSna 
(Upodgh&tapada 11. 49). 

These requirements of learning, character and good conduct 
would naturally make it incumbent on the performer of a 
sraddha to inquire into the antecedents, qualities and defects of 
the brShmanas to be invited, Manu and others lay down 
several rules about the testing of the brabmanas to be invited. 
Manu HI 149, Visnu Dh. 874 S. 88.1-3. provide ' at an offering to 
the gods let a man not enquire into (the qualities of) a 
brahmana (when he wants to invite ), but at a sraddha offering 
to the Manes close inquiry ( into qualities ) is declared to be 
proper and just.' Manu H 130 says that even if a br&hmana 
be master of the Veda, one should enquire far (into his 
ancestry ). The Vayupurana 6 ?* appears to provide that inquiry 
into (the qualifications of) brShmanas should not be alwayB 
undertaken when gifts are to be made, but enguiry is declared 
(necessary) in the case of rites for gods and Manes. The Anusa- 
sanaparva provides" 6 that in rites meant for gods aksateiya 
knowingthe rules about gifts should not (closely) inquire into the 
qualifications of brabmanas, but in «£•*»«* gods and 
Manes such inquiry is quite proper. Vrddha-Manu and the 
Matsya-pursna 8 " lay down that a brahmana s character is to to 
Squkedinto'at the place where he resides for a long : toe .his 
nuritvby Ms acts and transactions with other people, his intelh- 
SS by discission with him: with these toe one should 
taSe whether the br5hmana(to be invited) isaworthy person.

I^i Inquiring into qualifications 391 

TheKvaimhaputanaWs forbids close inquiry into the character 
and learning of one who comes by chance as a gaeBt at the time 
of sraddha. That inquiry was allowed as to brahman&s who were 
invited and not as to those who came by chance uninvited as 
attthis. There are no doubt certain passages particularly in 
the Piiranas where scrutiny into a brShmana's qualifications is 
condemned. For example, the Skandapurana quoted by Apa- 
rarka (p. 455) and Kalpatam ( on sr. p. 102) states 'The Vedic 
revelation is that sraddha is to be offered (to a brahmana) after 
inquiry (into his learning and character), hut straightforward 
action is better than scrutiny. When one offers sraddha 
straightforwardly without inquiry his pitrs are gratified ana 
also gods'. The Bhaviayapurana (q. .by Balanibba'ttI )^ states 
'it is my view also that one should not test (the qualifications of) 
brahmanas; one should only consider their caste and not their 
virtues'. Such passages aTe explained away as referring to a 
sraddha at sacred placeB or as applicable to gifts or to attthis 
(vide Hemadri on sraddha p. 513, and Balambhattl on acara 
p. 494) w8 ». 

Brahmanas were declared to be apa&Meya m (not fit to sit 
in the row of brahmana diners or as defiling a row of diners at 
sraddha) on various grounds, such as bodily and mental defects 
and diseases, pursuit of certain avooations, moral lapses, being 
guilty of crimes, being followers of unorthodox systems, being 
inhabitants of certain countries. A distinction has to be made 
between brahmanas who should not be invited and brahmanas 
that are apanktetja or pankhdusaka. For example, one should 
not ordinarily -invita a friend or a sagotra brahmana even

though learned, but these aie not apSnkteya. The Ap »» Dh S 
states that one suffering from white leprosy, a bald man! 
the violator of another man's bed, the son of a brahmana 
who was a soldier by profession, the son of (brahmana who had 
become like) a s&dra from a brahmana woman— these defile the 
company if they are invited at a sraddha repast. Vas. Dh. S. 
XL 19 also gives a brief list viz, *one should avoid naked (ascs- 
tios), those suffering from white leprosy, impotent men, blind 
men, those who have black teeth, those afflicted with black- 
leprosy and those who have deformed nails.' Very long lists of 
persons unfit to be invited at a sraddha are given by Gaut.

manas at a sraddha repast. Manu HI. 170-182 indulge in pointing 
out how feeding such unworthy brahmanas results in the loss 
of the gratification of pitrs and state that the food eaten by 
such unworthy persons becomes or is to he deemed as equal to 
foul things. The Kfirmapurana 8S2 forhids inviting at sraddhas 
Bauddha ascetics, Nirgranthas ( devotees who have withdrawn 
from the world and wander ahout naked or as heggars ), those 
that follow the Pancaratra and Pasupata doctrines, those that 
are kapalikas ( devotees of Siva of the left hand order ) and 
other similar heretical people. The Visnupurana (HL 18. 70 ff ) 
narrates how a king after a bath in a holy place talked with a 
heretic and had to pass in consequence through the bodies of 
a dog, a jackal, wolf, vulture, a crow, a crane and peacock and 
ultimately became freed from the taint by a bath at the ava- 
bhrtha in an Asvamedha sacrifice. The same Purana provides 
(I£L 18 97 ) that one should avoid talking with or touching 
f heretics, particularly at the time of a Teligious rite or when one 
has consecrated for a solemn sacrifice. The Vayupurana 883 
provides that people who are 'nagna' should not he allowed 
to see a sraddha and then defines 'nagna' people as follows: 
'the three Vedas are declared to be a protective covering for 
all beings and therefore those who foolishly abandon the Vedas 
are called 'nagna'-, those who vainly keep matted hair, those 
who shave their heads for no purpose, those who are nagna 
(naked) without any cause, those who engage in certain obser- 
vances and mutter certain words aimlessly are called nag- 
nadi\ Just as certain countries were declared unfit for the 
performance of sraddhas (vide note 853 above), so certain 
brahmanas hailing from certain countries were declared in some

worts as not fit to be invited at a sraddha. ^ Por example, the 
Matsyapurana states that brahmaaas that are ungrateful. Oat 
are atheists, that stay in Mieccha countries or the countries of 
Trisankn, Karavlra, Sndhra, Cma, Dravida and Eoakata should 
be carefully avoided at the time of Sraddha Hemadri (onsraocihs 
p. 505) quotes from the Saurapnrana the following : 'Srahmsnas 
hailing from the countries of Anga, Yariga, Ealinga, SsarSspsj, 
(Kathiawar), Garjara, Abhlra.IIohkana, DraTida, Daisioapsfiia, 
Avanti and Magadha should be avoided at sraddhas. R vrfil ba 
noticed that putting the above two passages together, 
brahmanas from half of modern India would have been ineligi- 
ble for being invited at sraddhas if these passages were literaBy 
followed. This was probably a counsel of perfection prompted 
by the false pride and prejudices of the authors of those wo&s. 
The Sraddhaviveka of Kudradhara (pp. 39-il) contains one 
of the longest lists of persons unfit to be invited at a sraddha. 

The following reason is advanced by the varahapursua 555 
and others for honouring a guest who comes by chance at the 
time when a sraddha rite is in progress: "logins wander over 
the earth assuming different forms that prevent recognition, but 
doing good to people; therefore a wise man should honours 
guest who arrives at the time of the performance of a sraddha". 
The Bhavisya-pursna ** similarly says th3t an tftiht (guest } at 
a sraddha is one who comes when least thought of and not cm 
who had arrived before the sraddha rite started. Tfee 
Mark a udeya(S6. 30) provides that one should not a"™ 
an oHflWatart his **« or aw* or Ms Y«bo study nor^mda 
one consider whether he has a fine appearance. Hemadn ( on

IV"} Honouring attthi at iraddka 397 

Visnudharmottara and Vayu ( 71.74-75 ) Furanas that gods, 
stddhas and yogina wander over the earth in the form of 
brahman a atithis in order to favour people and to see how 
sraddhas are being performed. About the definition of an 
altthi and the necessity and mode of honouring a guest in 
general, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 749-756. 

Hemadri ( Sraddhakanda, pp. 380-385 ) holds an interest- 
ing discussion as to whether a performer of sraddha belonging 
to one recension of a Veda must restrict himself to inviting 
brahmanas that are students of the same recension of the Veda 
or whether he can invite any brahmana that may have 
studied any of the three Vedas. Some people relying on 
a maxim ( 'as in the case of a bride so in the case of an 
offering' ) invite only brahmanas of their own idlcha possessed 
of the qualifications above set forth. Hemadri replies that 
this is a wrong notion, relies on Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 15. 9 ' one 
should feed 887 in all (religious) acts brahmanas that are pure (in 
their conduct) and that have studied the Veda' and asserts that 
no smrti, Itihasa, Furana, Grhyasutra nor Kalpasutra contains 
the restriction of inviting only brahmanas of the performer's 
own sakha. He further says that in such texts as ' trinaciketas- 
trimadhuh' (quoted in note 862a above) the rule laid down is to 
invite brahmanas that have studied different sakhas and Vedas. 
He rejects the idea about any restriction as to selecting a 
bridegroom of the same sakha, as the bride's father and remarks 
that if some people are not prepared to give their daughters in 
marriage to young men belonging to other sakhas, that is due 
to ignorance about the families and is also due to pride 
■and vanity. He winds up by saying that in Aryavarta 
countnesitis found on all sides that marriage connections 
are entered into with persons studying different sakhas hut 
Uvmg in the same district, (such connections) not being con- 
demned, while persons who study the same sakha of the Veda

rioted that the author of the Balambhatti recommend that 
Maharastra brahmanas should not invite brahmanas of other 
castes (of brahmanas) and particularly the Konkanastha 
brahmanas should be avoided and it goes so far as to say that 
a person belonging to one's own caste not possessed of good 
qualities and of a blemished character (provided he is not 
guilty of mahapatakas or the like) should be preferred to one 
belonging to another sub-ca3te even if endowed with good 
qualities. 

The Vas Db, S. provides S89 that the performer should 
invite ascetics, house-holders, -well conducted men, who are not 
very old &c. The Kurmapurana states w ' that man whose offer-

IV] Yali preferred as an invitee 399 

iDg (of food) is eaten by a yati that knows the truth about 
pralcrti (primordial matter) and the gu^as (sattoa, rajas and 
tamos) reaps the reward (merit) of feeding a thousand (other 
brahmanas ). Therefore one should feed in offerings to gods and 
manes an excellent yogin who is intent on true knowledge of God 
and others only if such a one is not available.' Similar verses 
about ascetics and yogins occur in Yarahapurana 14. 50, Skanda 
(VI. 217. 7ff)and Vayupurana 891 chap, 71. 65-73, chap. 76. 28 
&c. Brhaspati provides 8ra a special rule that, if a person cannot 
afford to feed at a sraddha more than one brahmana, then he 
should feed one who has studied the Samaveda, since in him 
all the three viz. TJks, the Yajus and Samans co-exist, that the 
father is phased by Rks (i. e. by the feeding of a brahmana 
who has studied the Sgveda), the grand-father by Yajus, the 
great-grand-father by a Saman and a chandoga (a chanter of 
the whole of Samaveda) is superior. A verse of Satatapa is 8, 3 
quoted to the effeot that if a student of the Atharvaveda is fed 
in a rite for the gods or manes, that yields endless and inex- 
haustible rewards. 

Some of the smrtis were very strict in laying down the 
qualidcations of brahmanas to be invited at a sraddha. Ausa- 
nasa (chap. 4) asserts: 'that brahmana 891 is called cfer&raA- 
mama and should never be invited at a sraddha in whose family 
Veda study and Vedl (i. e. the performance of Srauta sacri- 
fices) have been stopped for three generations'. The same

author** further says that six persons are merely brahmar 
bandhus (i. e. brahmanas by birth or caste alone) viz. one who 
ishiredbyasudraor a king as a servant, who has asudra 
woman as his wife, who is a village priest and he who subsists 
by killing (animals) or by oatohing them. So early as the 
Mahabhasya «* it was stated that austerities (leading a life of 
restraint and strict observances), Vedio learning and birth 
(from brahmana parents) are the causes of (a man being called) 
a brahmana and that he who is devoid of the first two is a mere 
brShmana by caste (but not a real brahmana). It is curious 
to note that Yama stated that, if brahmanas that do not declare 
(or point out) the auspicious naksatra or htlu or dayormu- 
hurta and other auspicious matters, eat (sraddha) food it be- 
comes inexhaustible. 

But the requisite qualifications were so exacting that it 
must have been found almost impossible to secure for a sraddha 
brahmanas altogether free from any of the blemishes set out 
above from Manu. Gautama (35 15-18) contains long lists ^ 
of over 50 kinds of brahmanas that were not to be invited at 
a sraddha dinner or at a sacrifice for gods, but Gaut adds that 
according to some only those beginning with 'durmla' (Gaut. 
in 15. 18) were to be shunned at a sraddha (but could be invited 
at a sacrifioe for the gods ). The persons so to be shunned, 
according to some who flourished before Gautama (i. e at least 
before 600 BO) are. a bald man, a man who has deformed 
nails or has black teeth (naturally), one suffering from white

leprosy, the son of a re-married woman, a gambler, one who 
neglects j'czpa ( the recitation of Vedic mantras), a servant of 
the king, one who uses false weights and measures, one whose 
(only) wife is a sudra female, one who does not perform the 
daily five sacrifices, one who suffers from a virulent skin 
disease, a usurer, one who lives by taade or by handicrafts, 
one who makes his living by (manufacturing) bows (and 
arrows) or by playing on musical instruments or by keeping 
time (when another is singing), or by dancing or singing. Vas. 
quotes a verse s 93 as follows : If a brahmana knowing the Vedas 
is afflicted with physical defects which ( ordinarily ) exclude a 
person from a tow of diners, Yama declares that he is irrepro- 
achable and that he does sanctify the row of diners. But it 
must be said that even in modern times emphasis is laid on 
inviting learned and well-conducted brahmanas for sraddha. 
The idea (expressed by Manu HI. 189 and the Padmapurana ) 
persists that the pitrs enter into and hover round the invited 
hrahmanas and that the latter are to be looked upon as represen- 
ting the pitrs. 1 * 19 The Garudapursna states that Yama allows 
the departed souls and the pitrs to visit the world of men at the 
time of sraddha from the nether regions. 

The Visnu Dh. S. (79. 19-21 ) prescribes that the performer 
should avoid wrath, should not shed tears and should not do

Kfirma (uttarardha %%, 8 ) states that if a person first invites a 
brahmatia and then foolishly invites another (passing over the 
first) then he becomes a greater sinner (than the brahmana who 
after accepting one invitation promises to dine at another 
sraddha) and is horn as a worm in human faeces. The 
Bhavisyapurana 9 "' 2 provides that honouring gods, pitrs and 
men and feeding (brabmanas) should not he done without 
wearing an upper garment; otherwise the rite will bear no fruit. 

About the number of brahmarjas to bo invited at a sraddha 
there were several options and several views. The 5.sv. Gr. S. 
states m that at the Farvana — sraddha (performed on a pm van 
dayi. e, on Am3vasya), the Abhyudayifca sraddha, theEkod- 
dista or Kamya, the larger the number of brabmanas the greater 
is the reward, that in no case should a person invite only one 
brahmana at a srSddha meant for all pitrs or he may optionally 
invite only one brahmana except at the first sraddha, that he 
may invite one, two or three brahmanas for each of the three 
paternal ancestors. The San. Gr. (IV. 1.2) and KausJtaki Gr ID. 
14. 1-3 prescribe that one should m invite an uneven number 
of brahmanas, at least three, to sit down as (representing the) 
fathers. Gaut, requires *> s 'He shall fee d an uneven number

of brahmanas, at least nine or as many as ho is able (to feed) 

a'nd tbat tbey should be learned in tbe Veda and endowed with 

polished speech, good appearance, mature age and good character*. 

If five were invited two would be for gods and three for pitrs ; 

if seven, then four for gods and three for pitrs and so on. Vas. 

XL 37 ( « Manu IE. 125 = Baud. Dh. S. IT. 8. 39 }, Yaj. I. 328, 

Matsya 17. 13-14, Yismipnrana DX 15.14 provide that one must 

feed two brahmanas at the rite for the gods and three for the 

manes or one only for each of the two purposes and even a 

rioh man should not go in for a large company. The Padtna- 

purana (Srsti 9.98 and 141) says the same thing. So the 

number of brahmanas to be invited did not depend so much 

upon the means of the inviter, but upon the point whether tbe 

inviter would be able to honour them all properly and with ease. 

The idea was that at the same time when sraddha was to be 

performed two brahmanas should be fed for gods and three for 

the pitrs. When only one brahmana could be invited or was 

available, Vas. (XI. 30-31) provides that portions of the several 

foods cooked should be put in a vessel and should be placed 

at the place where Vaisvadevika brahmana would have been 

seated, then served in a plate and the viive devah be invoked 

and should be contemplated as present and then the food 

should be thrown into the fire or offered to a Vedic 

student (as alms) and then sraddha rite should be continued. 

Sankha *> 6 14.10 provides a similar rule. The result is that if 

a man can afford to invite only one brahmaDa or can secure 

one only, then that brahmana is meant for the rite in honour of 

pitrs and the offering for the gods is to be cast into fire Baud 

Dh. S. II. 8.30, Manu III. 136, Vas. XI. 38, Kuroia (uttarSrdha 

32 28) contain the same verse which emphatically states 'A 

large company destroys these five desiderata, viz the respectful 

treatment (of those invited), the securing of a proper place 

(such as one sloping to the south) and time, purity and (the

choice of) meritorious brahmanaB; therefore one should not 
desire a large company' m The Kurmapurana (uttarardka 
22.32 } insists that an ahtht must be fed at a sraddha or other-, 
wise the sraddha is not praiseworthy. Though these ancient 
worts insisted upon the avoidance of large preparations 
and expenses for sr5ddhas in honour of a deceased person, 
there were other smrtis that favoured lavish distribution of 
wealth in sraddhas. J?or example, Brhaspati lays down: 
' ( An heir ) should lay aside half of the wealth that comes to 
him { by inheritance ) for the benefit of the deceased owner and 
should expend it in the monthly, six-rmonthly and yearly 
sraddhas'. The Dayabbaga XI. 12 approves sos of this and 
also quotes &p. Dh. S. H. 6. 13.3 ' On the failure of a sapinda 
the teacher of the Veda takes the wealth of the deceased, on 
failure of the teacher, the pupil takes it and having inheri- 
ted it he should employ it in the performance of works of 
charity for the benefit of the deceased' (or he himself may 
enjoy it). These passages show to what lengths the cult of 
benefit to the soul of the deceased was carried in India by 
certain writers. More practical authors such as Haradatts 
did not relish these extreme views. In several puranas such 
as the Vayu m " and Visnu there are express directions that 
when a sraddha is performed at Gaya, it should be on a profuse 
scale and no stinginess «" (lit. cheating in money matters ) in 
spending wealth should be shown there; otherwise the performer 
would not reap the benefit of the performance of sraddha at that 
holy place The Fadmapurana appears to inculcate profuse

expenditure of wealth in all sraddhas. The Vayupurana 9W 
(82. 26-28 ) further says that the brahman as of Gaya are super- 
men, that when they are gratified (at a sraddha) the gods 
together with pitrs become gratified, that no question should 
be raised about the family, the character, the learning and the 
austerities (of the Gaya brahman as), that by honouring them a 
man attains liberation, that a man after honouiing the 
biahmanas should proceed according to his resources and 
strength to the performance of Sraddha , thereby he secures all 
heavenly desires and obtains the means of Moksa. The Skanda- 
purana goes so far as to say that Gaya brahmanas even if 
they are depraved in their conduct and are backward deserve 
to be invited at sraddha and are superior to brahmanas who 
have mastered the Veda and Vedangas. The Nirnayasindhu 
( IH. p. 401 ) notes that, according to the Tristhallsetu of his 
grandfather, this provision holds good only in the case of the 
sraddha at the Aksayya Vata in Gaya and nowhere else. In 
modern times the brahmanas at Gaya > used to require the 
performer of sraddha while he was in the sacred Phalgu river 
to make a declaration about his wealth and demanded fees 
accordingly, thereby carrying to the letter the words of the 
Vayupurana. Many people returned from Gaya thoroughly dis- 
illusioned and disgusted with the conduct of the brahmanas 
at Gaya. In the Varahapurana 9U it is said that two verses 
were sung by the pitrs viz 'Would such a blessed and intelli- 
gent man be born in our family who will offer pindas (i.e. 
Sraddha) to us without being stingy about wealth and who 
would bestow on brahmanas with reference to us (i.e. for our 
benefit) jewels, clothes, land, costly vehicles and all other 
kmds of wealth including water, when he has riches enough?' 
Here lavish expenditure on all sraddhas (not only at Gaya- 
sraddha) appears to be strongly recommended. Devala prc-

itself. TheMatayapurana 913 andPadma (Srstj-khanda 9.85-88) 
provide that the person intending to perform a sraddha should 
in an humble manner invite the hrahmanas on the previous day 
or ( in the morning of ) the day of Sraddha, that he should touch 
the light knee (of the brahmana to be invited ) with the words 
'yon are given this invitation by me' and repeat in their hearing 
the following observance ' you should he free from anger, should 
be intent on purity (of body and mind) and should abstain from 
sexual intercourse and I, the performer of sraddha, shall also 
act in the same way and that the pitrs in an aerial form wait 
upon the invited hrahmanas.' The Brhan-naradiya-purana 
states that the invitation should be in the words ' O best men ' 
You should do me a favour and accept the invitation for 
sraddha.' It is noteworthy that the Prajapati-smrti (63) 
prescribes that one should invite hrahmanas for a sraddha or 
sacrifice for gods in the evening of the previous day after 
uttering the verae 'akrodhanaih &c* 91 * The Skandapurana "VI. 
217. 37 says that the performer should address the brahmana 
as follows: 'my father (is or will enteT) into this your body and 
so will my grand-father ; let him ( the grand-father ) come with 
his father and you should" strictly observe the vrata ' ( the rules ). 
The invitation to the brahman as representing pitrs is to be 
given with the sacred thread in the praciiiavita form and to 
those for Yaisvadevika in the y'ajiUypamta form. On the

there is a conflict among smrtis and the medieval digests propose 
an option (vide Hemadri on sraddha pp. 1154-1157). Maim 
III. 205 appears to lay down that the daiva brahmana should be 
invited first ( daivadyantam tad-Iheta), Yatna quoted by 
several digests ns says that the performer should request in the 
evening of the previous day brahmanas with the words 'You 
should all be free from exertions and should avoid passion and 
anger for the sraddha in my house which is to he performed 
tomorrow,' that the brahmanas should reply 'let it be so if the 
night passes happily and without any mishap to us.' The 
digests (e. g. Sraddhakriyakaumudi p. 81, Sraddhatattva p 194 
and Nirnayasindhu HI. p. 804) say that the verse 'sarvayasa 
&c ' may be repeated when the invitation is given on the day 
previous to the day of sraddha and the verse 'akrodhanaih' 
when the invitation is given on the morning of the sraddha day. 
The words of invitation differ according to different authorities. 
For example, according to the Mit on Yaj I. 225 the words are 
'sraddheksanahkriyatam.' VideSr. Pr. p. 106 also. Manu 
TIT. 187 and 191 show that the words 'nimantrana ' and 
'amantrana' are used as synonyms. In the SrSddhasutra 9 " of 
Eatyayana the word ' SmantraDa ' is used. But Panini "' (HI. 
3 161) apparently makes a difference between the meanings of 
the two words and the Mahahhasya explains that invitation is 
called 'nimantrana' which if rejected (without proper cause) 
involves a fault or sin, while that invitatwn which one is free 
to reject (without incurring blame) is called 'amantrana There- 
fore it must be held that the few writers such as Eatyayana 
X employ amantrana use it in a secondary sense ^ The 
Station should be given by a performer himself or by his son,

brother or a pupil or a brahmana, but it should not be given 
through a person of another varria 91B or a woman or a child or 
person belonging to another gdtra nor from a distance (Prajapati 
64). Pracetas provides that a brahmana performer of sraddha 
when giving an invitation should touch the right knee, a 
ksatriya inviter the left knee of the invitee, a Vaisya inviter 
should hold both feet of the invitee and a sudra should prostrate 
himself at the feet of the invitee (vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 and S. K. 
L. p. 47). The Markandeya (28. 35) states an exception that 
if, when a sraddha rite is going on, brahmanas or Vedic students 
or ascetics come by chance begging for food, the performer 
should make them pleased by falling at their feet and feed them 
(i. e. no formal invitation is necessary in these cases). Vide 
Visnupurana HI. 15. 12 for feeding uninvited ascetics. It is 
provided by Bhrgu quoted by Hemadri that the brahmanas on 
accepting the invitation should pronounce the finely-worded 
and comprehensive Vedic benediction quoted below. 919 

TTsanas 919 " provides that the performer should wash the 
floor of his house with water, cowdung it and cleanse the vessels 
on the day previous to the sraddha and then give an invitation 
to the brahmanas with the words 'tomorrow I am going to 
perform Sraddha'. The Varahapurana and the Kfirma &\"o 
provide for this and for the washing of the clothes Manu HI 
206 also requires that the spot where sraddha is to be performed 
should he clean, secluded, cowdunged and should slope to 
the south.

mana who has been invited (to a sraddha dinner) by a faultless 
performer should not refuse the invitation nor should lie, after 
being invited (and having accepted the invitation), accept a 
gift of even (uncooked) food from another person. Maim III 190 
and Kurmapurana provide that if a brsbmana after receiving an 
invitation for a sacrifice to gods or manes according to s3slra 
directions and after having accepted at violates the appoint- 
ment, he incurs sin and becomes a hog MI (in his nex:t birth). 
This does not apply where he js uDable to go on account of 
illness or other valid reason, t 

The smrtis laid down some strict and elaborate rules which 
were to be observed by the brabmanas invited for sraddha ami 
by the performer himself. Many of the rules are applicable to 
both. Gaut prescribes m that the brahmana who has partaken 
of sraddha dinner should remain chaste (i. e. shun sexual inter- 
course ) that whole day, and if he lias intercourse with a wife 
of the sBdra caste he thereby makes his own pitrs stay in the 
ordure of that wife. Vas XL 37 makes tbis rule applicable 
both to the performer and the invited brahmana and as regards 
wives of all ucrms. Manu IH. 188 provides that the brahmana 
invited to dine at a sacrifice in honour of pitrs and the per- 
former of the sraddha should remain controlled (i. o. chaste 
and free from anger and passion) and should not study the 
Veda (except^). Taj. I 225 (latter half) briefly P"ts the 
matter by saying 'they should be controlled as to their bodies, 
speech and thoughts'. The Matsyapurtna «» proscribes hat

The Mit. on Yaj. I 79 appears to strike a dissenting note about 
sexual intercourse with one's wife during the days from the 5th 
to the 16th; while most other medieval writers such as Hernadri 
( sr. pp. 1006-7 ) and Sr. P. p. Ill are opposed to this view, 
TheSraddhasutra 924 of Katyayana provides that the performer 
should, from the time of giving invitation to the time when the 
brahmanas sip water {i. e. perform acamana after sraddha 
dinner), remain pure, free from anger, hurry, negligence, should 
speak the truth and should shun a journey, sexual intercourse, 
hard work and'study of the Veda and control speech (should 
remain mostly silent)' and the brahmanas invited should 
observe the same rules Ausanasa ( Jiv. vol 1 pp. 526-527 ) 
contains verses very similar in import to Katyayana. The 
Brahmapurana (220. 106-108), Markandeya (ZS. 31-33) and 
Anusasana 125.34 have identical verses 925 and Vayu 79. 60-61 
are very similar in import. Laghu-Sankha 29, Laghu-Harlts 
75 and Likhita 60 have the same verse requiring the invited 
brahmanas to avoid eight matters, viz. dining'again, journey, 
carrying loads, Vedic study, sexual intercourse, making gifts! 
accepting gifts, performing homa, while Frajspati 92 substi- 
tutes the brushing of the teeth (with a twig), tambula, bath 
after applying oil to the body, and fast for the first four of the 
above eight The Anusasanaparva (90. 12-13) and Padma 
(Fatalakhanda 101. 94-95) also contain a list of actions that 
should be avoided Briefly put, the following were the obser- 
vances for both inviter and invitee, viz avoidance of sexual 
intercourse, dining again, falsehood, hurry, vedic study, heavy 
work gambling, carrying burdens, giving gifts and acceptance 
of gifts, theft, journey, sleep by day, quairels; the performer 
alone was to abstain from eating tambula, shaving, applying

mana invited was (alone) to observo the following, viz. not 
alfflonting oneself after accepting an invitation, making no 
delay when called for dinnor (vido Sraddhakaliks folio 4b and 
5a and Fitr-bhakti on sraddha'*). 

Elaborate provisions aro made from ancient times about the 
substances and utonsila proper for being used at sraddha and 
about thoso that should not bo usod therein. Ap. Dh, M ' S. 
remarks: 'tlio materials in sraddha aro sosamum, mSsas, 
rico, yavaa (barloy), wator, rootfl and fruits; but the pitrs 
aTo extremely gratified by food that is mixed with clarified 
bnttor and for a very long time; so also they aro gratifiod 
by woalth that is obtained lawfully and is bestowed on worthy 
persons '. Manu III 267 ( •= VSyu 83. 3 ) is to the same effect 
as Ap. Dh. S. Yfij. I. 258 is content to say that food which 
is fit to bo offered in Bacrificss (havwya) should be served. 
Manu III. 257 oxplains that food eaten by hermits in the 
forost, ( cow's ) milk, soma juice, moat that is not prepared 
with spicos (or that ie free from a bad smell), rock salt 
aro by their vory nature fiavis (sacrificial food). According 
to Gaut. 37.11 the sacrificial food (few's) comprises boiled 
rice, food obtained by bogging, ground barley (after being 
baked or fried), grain separated from husk, barley gruel, vege- 
tables, milk, ourds, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. m 
Other imirtis and digests very much elaborated these brief 
indications in the early works. The three kinds of wealth (via 
iukh, iabala and Icrsna ) and the several lawful or uncondemned 
means of acquiring wealth have been described already in H. 
of Dh. vol 11 pp 130 ff. The Markandeya (29. 14-15) 
condemns the use in sraddhas of wealth that is obtained by 
taking bribes or from a pahta (one guilty of a grave sin), that 
spring from bride-price or that is declared to be unlawful 
or b obtained by saying to another 'give "»**«»«*» 
of a sraddha to be offered to my father" (a. by Sm.O.on 



22-2<. 






IV} Materials to be employed 413 

erSddha p. 412), The Skandapurana emphasizes that at a 
sraddha purity (suddhi) must be specially secured in Beven 
matters viz. the body (of the performer), the materials, the 
wife, the place (where sraddha is to be performed), the mind, 
the mantras and brahmanas. 929 Manu IIL 235 (=Vag. 11.35 ) 
states : three are the sanctifying things in a srsddha, viz. a 
daughter's son, a Nepal blanket and sesamum grains and three 
are commended in sraddha viz. eleanliness, freedom from anger 
and absence of hurry. 939 ? Pracetas mentions several kinds of 
corn that are commended as food in sraddha. Manu m, 255 
summarises that in sraddha the riches (i. e. the most im- 
portant matters) are afternoon, darbhas, proper cleansing of 
the place (or house) for sraddha, sesame, generous expense (on 
food &c), seasoning food, eminent brahmanas. 

The MarkaDdeya-purana says that several kinds of corn- 
yielding plants (some due to tillage in villages and some 
growing wild) were produced by Brahma when he milked the 
earth for famished people, while Brahmavaivarta (q. by Hemsdri 
on sraddha p. 537 ) affirms that when a few particles fell down on 
the earth while Indra drank Soma, from them arose such corn as 
syamSka, wheat, yam, mudga and red paddy and as they were 
produced from soma they were like nectar to the pitrs and 
food prepared from these should be offered to pitrs. The 
MSrkandeya speaks of seven kinds of grUrmja corn and seven 
kinds of wild {arawa) corn. Prajapati 119 recommends the 
use of eight kinds of corn, viz. nivSra, masa, mudga, wheat 
paddy yava, grain and sesamum. TheMatsya(q byHemadri 
on sraddha p 538] I narrates that when the B«! faj* Sa

Brahiuamla H. 7. 1^3-152 and III 14, contain similar lists of 
different kinds of corn that may 1)3 used in sraddhas. Tiie 
Vayupimlna (80. 43-18) mentions various desirable eatables 
prepared from corn of various kinds, sugar and clarified buttor 
and milk. 932 

Certain kinds of corn and cereals were forbidden. For 
example, the Matsya-purana and Padma (Srstikhanda, chap. 
9 62-66 ) 933 declare that masura, linseed, nispava, rajamSsa, 
kusumbhika, kodrava, udara, gram, kapittha, madhuka and 
linseed ore forbidden Visnu Dh S. 79. 18 provides that the 
performer should avoid tho bean called rajamasa, masUra, stale 
food ai»d salt manufactured fiom seawater. The Sat-tnmsa- 
nmata m forbids the use in sraddha of all kinds of cereals 
covered with dark husk except sesamum, mudga and masa.

IV"] ; What milk and xvafer to be used 415 

From considerations of space this matter cannot be pursued 
further. The Mifc. on Yaj. I 240 puts together a long list of 
.allowed and of condemned kinds of grains and other articles. 

What milk should be ordinarily partaken of and what 
should be avoided has been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 
783-783. A. few words are added here. Manu IE. 271 and Yaj. I. 
258 provide that if cow's milk or rice cooked therein (called 
paijasa) is offered in sraddha the pitrs are satisfied for one 
year. Vayu 78. 17, Brahma** 230169, Markandeya 32 17-19, 
Visnupurana HI.16.11 forbid the use in a sraddha of the milk of 
a she-buffalo, of a catuarl or female deer, of sheep or ewes, of 
she camels, of human females and of all animals with one hoof 
and the use of the curds and clarified butter prepared from such 
milk. But ghee prepared horn butlalo milk was allowed by 
Sumantu and Devala ( q.. by Hemadri on sraddha p. 572 ). 

The Markandeyapurana M6 ( 29.15-17 ), Vayu (78.16) and 
Visnupurana (B216 10) lay down that the water to be employed 
in sraddha must not have a bad smell, must not be foamy, or 
taken from a puddle or a small reservoir which cannot slake the 
thirst of a cow, must not have been brought overnight, must not 
be taken from a reservoir not dedicated to all or from a trough 
or the like meant for beasts. 

Several rules are laid down about the fruits, roots and 
vegetables recommended or condemned for use in sraddha. 
For example, the Brahma-purana (220.156-158) enumerates 
•several kinds of fruits such as mangoes, bilia, pomegranate, 
cocoanut, dates, grapes, as fit to be given in sraddha. Vide 
Sankha 14 22-23 also. Vayu ( 78 11-15 ) states 935 " that garlic, 
leeks and onions, other things that are of bad odour or taste

and all exudation from trees not permitted by the Veda and sa 
gathered from saltish earth, should be avoided in sraddha, Th 
Vismidharmasutra w (79.17) contains a long list of fruits 
bulbs and vegetables that were not to be employed in sraddha. 
The Bamayfina states 938 that Bshia when an exile in the 
Dandakfi forest gratified his pitrs by offering the fruits of inguda, 
badara, and bilva trees and generalises that deities are offered 
that food which is partaken of by a person ( who is a devotee of 
rhat deity). From considerations of space detailed references to 
the smrtis and purfinas are passed over. The Smrtyarthasara 
pp. 52-53, Sraddhaviveka (pp. 43-47 ) of Eudradhara and other 
digests collect in one place the foods, vegetables, fruits and root* 
that are allowed to be offered in sraddha and that are condemned 
in srsddha. Manufactured salt was forbidden, bnt natural salt 
from a lake (called saindhava) was allowed. Salt was not to 
be served directly (as Visnudharmasutra 79. 12 says) hut when 
put in while cooking vegetables it was not prohibited, There 
was a difference of opinion about the employment of asafmtida 
(vide HemSdri on Sraddha p. 565). The Visnudharmasutra 
(79. 5-6 ) provides that flowers having a strong (or nasty) odour 
or no odour at all, the blossoms of thorny plants and red flowers 
should not be given, bnt one may give white and sweet-smell- 
ing flowers even though they are taken from thorny plants and 
flowers though red in colour may be taken from agnatic plants. 
Sankha (14. 15-16) is to the same effect (q. by HemSdri p 684). 
Vayu (75 33-35) is to the same effect and adds that the flowers 
called Japa, Bhandi, Eupika (of arka plant), Kamrtak* 
should be avoided in sraddha. The Brahmapurana (^-^ 
165 ) specifies the several kinds of flowers that may be offered in 
sraddha such as jati, campaka. malliks, mango blossom , tatart. 
tagara.ketakl and various kinds of lotuses (white, «""*»* 
&c) The Smrtyarthasara includes tulasi among things to V*

greenish darbhas together with ends uncut, that are smooth and 
well nourished, one aralni in length and touched with that part 
of the hand called pitrtirtlia are pure. The Padmapurana 
( Srstikhanda 11.92 ) and Skanda VlLl. 205.16 state that kusas 
and black sesamura spring from • the body of Visnu and the 
Visnudharmottara 1. 139.12 says that ttlas and darbhas sprang 
from the perspiration and hair of Visnu in the Boar incarna- 
tion. The Matsya ( 22.89 } sayB the same. 

TheGaruda 941 (Pretakhanda 2.21-23} states that all the 
three gods dwell in kusa grass viz. Brahma at its root, Visnu in 
the middle and Sankara at the end and that brahmanas, 
mantras, kusas, fire, tnjasl leaf— these do not become nirmalya 
( stale and so unfit to be used again ) even when the same are 
employed again and again. But an exception is made by 
Gobhila M2 that those darbhas which are spread on the ground 
for placing pindas on them or that are used in tarpana and those 
that are held in the hand while a man is answering the calls of 
nature should be given up ( and not used again ). TheVisiiu 
Dh. S. 79.2 and Vayu 75.41 provide that if kusas are not avail- 
able, kasa grass or Durva may be substituted. The Skanda- 
purSDaVH(Prabhasakhanda) part 1.206.17 says that straight 
darbhas are used in giving gifts, at baths, in japa, homa, dinner 
.and worship of gods, but they are double-folded whenusedin rites 
for pitrs. The Skanda VH. I 205.16 provides that the top of 
darbhas is for divine rites, while darbha with the root and tip is 
meant for paiMca rites. This is based on the Sat. Br IT 4. 2.17 
which states that the top of the dmbha belongs to gods, the 
middle to men and the root part to the fathers. 

Great importance was attached to the use of ttla (sesamum) 
in iSSL The Jaiminigrhya IU states that the whole « 
should have sesamum grains scattered about m it. Baud Dh.

water. The Prajapatismrti speaks 943 of four kinds of tilas viz. 
white, black, very black and jai tilas and' states that each 
succeeding one gives greater gratification to the pltrs than each 
preceding one.- The Tai. S. V. 4.3.2 refers to jartilas and Jai. 
X. 8.7 holds a discussion thereon. The Naradapurana (purvardha 
28 36) 914 provides that the performer of sraddha should scatter 
Mas in the midst of the brahmanas invited and at the doors 
with the mantra ' apahata * ( may the asuras and evil spirits 
that sit on the altar be struck and run away ). Yaj. I. 234 also 
recommends this mantra ( which is Yaj. S. II. 29). The Kurma- 
purana (II. 22. 18) states that sesame should be scattered all 
round and a goat should he tied near the spot, since sraddha 
polluted by asuras becomes purified by sesame and a goat. 
The VisnupuTana (1IL 16.14 ) prescribes that by tilas scattered 
on the ground one should ward off evil spirits ( Yatudhana ). 
The Garudapurana 945 (Pretakhanda 2. 16 ) makes Srlkrsna say 
' tilas have sprung from' the 'perspiration on my body and are 
holy; asuras, dZmavas and daityas run away on account of tilas.' 
The Ahusasana-parva (90.22) says that yatudhanas and goblins 
snatch away the Jiavis when the sraddha is offered without tilas. 
The Krtyaratnakara ( p. 540 ) quotes a verse as follows : ' he 
Who applies as unguent ttlas, who bathes with water in which 
tilas are mixed, offers ttlas into fife, makes gifts of Mas, eats 
tilas and who ■ grows tilas — these six never sink ( i. e. are not 
unlucky nor in trouble ). 

A. great deal is said about the vessels to be used in offering 
aighya (water fof honouring the invited brahmanas and pindas), 
for cooking sraddha food, for dining and for serving. The 
Sraddhasutra of Katyayana 9is provides that the arghy a water

should be taken in camaaaB (cups) made of sacrificial 
trees (such as palSsa, asvattha, udumbaTa) or in vessels 
of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn, precious stees 
whichever may be available, or in a vessel made of leaves. 
The Visnu Dh. S. (79. 14-15) provides that the performer 
should employ metallic vessels, particularly vessels made of 
silver. Hie Markandeya (31.65) and Vsyu (74.3) state that 
in a vessel of silver the (ancient) pitrs milted svadka and 
hence a silver vessel is highly desired by pitrs and brings de- 
light to them. Yaj. I 337 also specially recommends silver 
vessels. The Vsyu (74. 1-3), Matsya (17. 19-32), BrahmSnda 
(Upodghata 11. 1-2) and Padma (Srstikhanda 9. 147-150) 
state that vessels of gold, silver or copper are the (proper) ones 
for pitrs; that even the talk about silver or the sight or gift of 
silver gives inexhaustible results to pitrs in heaven, that vessels 
to be used for arghya, for piDda and for the food to be offered 
should be preferably of silver and that in rites for gods a silver 
vessel is not auspicious. Atri (q by Sm. 0. H, p. 464) says 
that in rites for the gods and pitrs, vessels of gold and silver 
should be respectively employed and in default of these vessels 
of other metals (such as copper, bell-metal) should be used (as 
stated by Visnu Dh. S. 79.22 and U). The Padma provides*' 
that the vessels may be of sacrificial wood or rfjriBfeartf 
silver or made from a sea product (such as conch shell) and that 
since silver was produced from the eye of Siva, »*>»«»* 
favourite with pitrs. PrajSpati (ill) P«mdes that the three 
pindas should be cast in a vessel of gold or silver or copper or bell- 
Ltaloc of rhinoceros horn but not in earthenware , or a wooden 
vessel, that (verse 113) the cooking vessels i should be of «jj 
or of any metal, but an earthen vessel baked in fire and

17. 19-20. The use of plantain leaves 'for bhojana is forbidden 947 " 
by some. Brahmanas should not take acamana from a vessel 
made of bell-metal, kharpara, sukra, stone, clay, wood, fruit 
or iron. Acamana should be performed with water from a 
copper vessel. Atri (153) prescribes that no food should be 
served from an iron vessel; if so served the food is like ordure 
to the diner and the server goes to hell. The vessels for cook- 
ing sraddha food are to be made of gold, silver, copper or bell- 
metal or even of clay provided the last are new ones and strong 
(well baked) but never of iron. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 155 for details. 
The Vianu Dh S. (79. 24) quotes a verse which says that food 
offered in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or of 
phalgu, wood becomes inexhaustible. 

Visnu Dh. S 79. 11 provides that for unguents ( anulepana) 
to be applied to the bodies of the invited brahmanas, sandal- 
wood, saffron, camphor, agwu, padmalca may be nsed. The 
Brahmapurana (220. 165-166) mentions kustha, jata-mansl, 
nutmeg, uslra, musta and some others as proper perfumed 
articles to be used at sraddhas. 

It has already been seen at pp. 4l3-14 what kinds of food were 
recommended or condemned for sraddha. The Matsyapurana ** 
states that food containing milk and curds and clarified butter 
from cow's milk mixed with sugar gives satisfaction to all pitrs 
for one month and that whatever food, whether cow's milk or 
ghee or rice cooked in milk, is mixed with honey, yields 
inexhaustible results. The Brahmapurana also (220 182-184) 
provides that such eatables as are sweet and oily and are 
slightly sour and pungent should be served in sraddha and one 
should shun eatables that are very sour or very saltish or very 
pungent, since they are asu-a (fit for asuras). Great emphasis 
was laid on serving preparations of food made from masa

beans. The Ausanasa w — smrti pronounces the threat that 
the brahmana, who, when dining at sraddha, does not eat mSsa 
food, becomes a beast for twenty-one births after death. The 
Sm. 0. quotes a smrti text saying that a sraddha in which no 
niasa preparation is offered is as good as not performed. 

The greatest divergence has prevailed about the employ- 
ment of flesh at sraddbas among writers from the earliest times. 
The subject of flesh-eating in general has been discussed at 
great length in the History of Dharmasastra, vol. H. pp 772-78Z. 
A few remarks about flesh in relation to sraddha will not be 
out of place here. The Ap. Dh. S. prescribes 9S0 that the obli- 
gatory Sraddha (to be performed every month) must contain 
food mixed with fat, the best course (for supplying fat) is to 
employ clarified butter and flesh; on failure of these two, sesa- 
murn oil and vegetables may be employed. The same sfltra 
also provides 9S1 that the pitrs are gratified for a year by the 
offering of cow's flesh in a sraddha, that by the flesh of a buffalo 
the gratification of pitrs extends to more than a year, that this 
rule extends to the flesh of wjld animals (like hares) and 
village (or domesticated) animals (like goats) that are declared 
to be fit for being sacrificed, that the gratification of pitrs 
extends to endless time if the flesh of a rhinoceros is offered to 
brahmauas seated on rhinoceros skin, so also by the flesh of the

that the brahmana who is employed for the performance >of a 
§raddha and does not eat flesh offered therein becomes a beast 
for 21 births. Manu 10. 257 states that the following are said 
to be proper offerings in a sraddha by their very nature viz. 
food (prepared from nioara grain and the like) fit for a forest 
hermit, milk, soma juice, flesh that does not emit foul smell and 
unmanufactured salt. An ascetic was ordinarly required not 
to partake of flesh; but Vasistha insisted on his partaking of it 
when invited at a sraddha.

honey, of food fit for hermits ( wild com such as nlvara ), the 
flesh of a red goat, of MahasiSka ( i. e. Kalasaka ), and the flesh 
of V&rdhrtnasa— these secure inexhaustible fruit There is some 
divergence of views among the several worts. For example, 
Manu m. 267 and 271, Katyayana ( in sraddhasutra 7 ) appear 
to hold that by offering food prepared from village corn 
(such as rice, masa & a. ) "or wild eatables (such as nivara or 
fruits and roots) the gratification is only for one month 
and the flesh of Vardhrlpasa produces gratification for twelve 
years only ( and not for all time ). • Visnu Dh. S. 80.10 and 
Manu IIL 270 bring in buffalo flesh and tortoise flesh 
as giving gratification for ten and eleven month respec- 
tively. Hemadri (on sraddha p 590 )** is careful to point 
out that these words about the duration of time are not to be 
taken literally but what is really intended is to convey 
greater and greater gratification of the pitrs according to 
the kind of flesh offered. Pulastya o^ioted by the Mit and 
Apararka p. 555 provides that a brahmana should generally or 
mainly offer at a sraddha hermit's food, a ksatriya or a vaisya 
should offer flesh, a sSdra should offer honey and all varnas 
may offer anything else (except these three) which is not 
forbidden. •» Whoever may be the offerer, the eater at a 
Sraddha dinner was to be a brahmana alone and so it follows 
that brahmanas invited to a sraddha by a ksatriya or vaisya 
had to eat flesh. Yet it is remarkable that even the Mifcaksara 
and the Kalpataru written about 1100-1120 A. D. .do not 
expressly say that in the Kali age flesh-eating at sraddha u 
totally prohibited at least for brahmanas. It has been shown 
already (ff. of Dh. vol III pp. 775-776) that even when animal 
sacrifices were the order of the day in %^f.?" d g 
Brahmanas there was an undercurrent of bought teat the 
offerings of fuel-sticks or of ^* r "Xf o&Sg t 
felt devotion to the gods we re as good as flesh offerings to r

securing their favour. In course of time that conception grew str- 
onger and stronger, so much so that Manu (V. 27-44 and V. 46-47) 
and Vasistha appear to be in two minds ( vide H. of Dh. vol. 
H pp. 778-780 ). Gradually the offering of flesh in Madhuparka 
and in sraddhas came to be totally condemned in works of the 
12th and 13th centuries and onwards as a matter prohibited in 
the Kali age (Varatithipitrbhyasca pasupakaranakriys ). (Vide 
H. of Dh. vol. HI pp. 945-946 and p. 964 ). Now except among 
the brahmanas ( in Northern India ) who have no objection to 
include fish in diet as permissible to them no br&hmana offers 
flesh in sraddha. The usage of Northern India would be in 
accordance witb the view set out in Brhannaradlya purana that 
one should offer honey, flesh and other things according to the 
usage of the country, as explained by the Prfchvlcandrodaya. 

Manu(V.ll-18) contains long lists of animals, birds and 
fishes whose flesh was not to be eaten even by those who were 
flesh-eaters. 

If a person is destitute, some of .the Puranas such as the 
Visnu (EL 4.24-30) and the Varaha (13.53-58) mercifully provide 
in identical*® verses that instead of entertaining brahmanas 
with a sumptuous dinner or flesh the poor man may offer only un- 
cooked corn, or some vegetables growing wildly or some slight 
daksina if he cannot offer even uncooked food or vegetables or he 
may offer a few grains of sesamum (7 or 8 ) to a brahmana' with 
water in his folded hands, or grass to a cow enough for one 
day and if he cannot afford even any one of these, then he may 
repair to a thicket of trees, raise his arms so that his armpits 
are exposed and loudly address the guardians of the worlds 
such as the Sun in the following words : ' I have neither wealth

ft is now time to describe fee procedure of tie Parvana- 
ergddha K " which is the pattern or norm (prakrfi) of the other 
sraddhas 55 {even including the Asta&as). Here one meets 
with great divergences of views even from the times of the 
sfitras up to modern times. Though the main items and stages 
in the rite of sraddha are generally the same, there 13 variation 
in the mantras, the details and sometimes in the order of the 
several items. Kstyayana lays down that every man has to 
follow his own sulra as to the use of the word'svaha'orthe 
words 'svadba namah', as to wearing the sacred thread 
in the yajfiopavita or praclnavlta way and as to the number 
of ofatfts 957 .

the sacrifice to the fathers in the most ancient Yedic tests.

Fathers have the steam of rice as their share; he should simply 
smell (the pindas). That as if does not amount to eating or 
non-eating. The pitrs when departing (from the sraddha rite) 
take away or grant a valiant son. He cuts off the fringe (of a 
garment to place it on the pindas), for the share of Fathers is 
taking away (what is offered). He (thereby) allots their proper 
share to the pitrs (and dismisses them). When (the performer) 
is in the latter part of life (i e. over 50 years of age) he cuts off 
hair (from his chest instead of presenting a daia) At that time 
he is nearer to the pitrs (when above 50 years of age). He offers 
adoration, because adoration (mmasffira) is dear to the pitrs.

IV] Pivfapitryairia in &at. Mr. 429 

The Sat. Br. (II. 4. 2) contains the following somewhat 
fuller account of the Pinda-pitryajfia, omitting legendary or 
other irrelevant matters —When the moon is not seen either 
in the east or in the west, then he (the performer of the Darsa 

sacrifice) presents food to the Fathers in each month He 

presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon indeed belongs to 
the gods; the midday to man; and the afternoon to the Fathers ; 
therefore he presents (food to the Fathers) in the afternoon. 
While seated behind the Garhapatya fire with his face turned 
towards the south and the sacred thread on his right shoulder 
he takes that material (for the offering from the cart). There- 
upon he rises from thence and threshes the rice while standing 
north of the Daksina fire and facing the south. Only once does 
he clean the rice, for it is once for all that the fathers have 
passed away. He then hoils it. While it stands on (the 
Daksina fire) he pours some clarified butter on it. After remov- 
ing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two oblations in the 

fire Heie he & engaged in a sacrifice to the Fathers; hence 

he thereby propitiates the gods and being permitted by the gods, 
he presents that food to the Fathers. He offers to both Agni 
and Soma ..He offers with the formula 'To Agni, the carrier 
of fe«2/a(what is offered to the Manes), svahal', 'To Soma 
accompanied by the Fathers, svaha! • ( Va 3 S, H 39 ) He then 
puts i the pofc-ladle(meksana) on the fire, that being in lieu of

pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, 
so in this case. Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) 
are severed with ono stroke and cut off near the root; the 
top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men and the 
root paTt (of darbhas) to the fathers. Therefore they are 

cut off near the roots He spreads them along with the 

line with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents 
(to tho fathers the three round cakes of rice). He presents 
thus: — for the gods they offer thus for men they ladle 
out; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way; 
therefore lie presents (the cakes to the fathers) thus With 
'N. N., this for thee !' he presents one cake to the sacrificer's 
father. Some add 'for those that come after thee*, but let him 
not say this, since he himself is 'one of those to whom it would 
be offered in common. Let him therefore merely say "N. N., 
this for thee !' as to tho sacrificer's father; 'IT. N., this for thee* 
as to his grandfather; 'F H„ this for thee' as to his great- 
grandfather He then mutters 'Here, O fathers, regale your- 
selves ; like bulls come hither each to his own share I' ( Va]. S. 
II. 31\ Whereby he says 'Eat each his own share'. He then 
turns round to the left so as to face the opposite (north) side'; 
for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is 
far away (from the fathers). 'Let him remain (standing with 
bated breath) until his breath fail' say some; for thus far 
extends the vital energy'. However, having :rema,ne I so far a 
moment-he again turns round (to the right) and mutters the

monthly sraddha (masi-sraddha) is the prakrti of Astalrs and 
other sraddhas in which three ancestors are to be invoked. It 
is as follows • Now then at a Parvana-sraddha, or at a sraddha 
celebrated for securing some desired object, or atanibhyu- 
dayika-sraddha or at an Ikoddistasraddha, the performer 
causes to sit down brahmanas who are endowed with learning, 
moral character and proper conduct or who are endowed with 
(at least) one (of these three characteristics), who have been 
invited already in proper time, who have taken a bath, whose 
feet are washed (by the performer) and who have sipped water 
(taken Seamava), as representatives of (or eq.ua! to) the Fathers, 
with their faces turned to the north, one for each of the 
Fathers, or two for each or three for each. The larger the number 
of brahmanas invited the greater is the fruit or reward. But 
in no case (should he invite) only one for all (the Fathers), 
or he may invite only one brahmana except at the first 
sraddha %7 . By the exposition of the Findapitryajna the rules 
for the parvana-sraddha have been declared. Having given 
water (into the hands Of the invited brahmana or brahmanas 
after they sit down) and double-folded darbha Wades as a seat

970. The rules about Kndapitryafija have been set forth in AsV. Sr. S, 
II. 6 Narayana notes ( on Asv gr. IV 7 2) that Asvalayana treats of only 
the procedure relating to the rite for pitrs and that he does not at all refer 
to the dinner given to datva or Vaisvadeva brahmanas at the time of 
sraddba It is therefore possible that feeding daiva brahmanas was added 
to the ancient ritual, though it must be said that ManuIII. 125, "?aj. I. 
224-28 and Vas XI. 27 prescribe such feeding. Dr. Caland (in ' Ahnencult' 
p 161 ) asserts that he can prove that the detail of feeding daiva brahmanas 
spread from the Sraddhasutra of Katyayana to the other surras and he relies 
on the fact that Katyayana (in Kandiia2) prescribes that the visve devah 
thould be invoked with the verse • Visve devasa agata * and the performer 
should mutter the verse « visve devah srnutemam ' which are respectively 
Vaj S. VII. 34 and XXXIII 53. But Dr. Caland tries to prove too much. 
The first verse occurs twice in the Rg. (II 41. 13 and VI 52 7) and the 
second occurs in Rg. VI. 52 13,Tai S II 4 14 5. They are not found 
only m the Vaj. S as Dr. Caland seems to have thought It is possible that 
other works took over those mantras from the Rgveda or the Tai S It 
may also be noted that Yaj. I. 229 mentions only -VisVe devasa' and specifies 
that it .s a rk ( and not a mantra or yajus ). So Y5j. at least doesW appear 
to have borrowed the prescripts of Katyayana. It is not necessary to 
examine the other arguments.

are torrestnal, that are golden-hued, and fit for sacrifice-may 
these waters bnng us welfare and be favourable to us'. Pouring

sipped water and the food (that remains) is mixed with the 
food that is served to the brahmanas, since it is said 'what 
is abandoned and given to (brahmanas) 976 brings prospe-

'Oral Svadha !). 9 «>« 

From considerations of space it is impossible to set out all 
the differences among the several grhyasBtras of the ftgveda, 
of the Taittirlya sakha (viz. Baudhayana, Ap , Hir.,Bharadv§ja 
and Vaikhanasa), of the Vajasaneya sakha (such as Sraddhasfitra 
of Katyayana), of the Samaveda (such as Gobhila and Khadiia) 
and of the Atbarvaveda (being Kausika sutra) A few matters 
may be set out by way of illustration. The Ap. gr. (81. 3-4)' 81 
states that (after the brshmanas are invited for sraddha dinner) 
from the food prepared for the dinner a portion is taken out in 
a vessel and therefrom seven fflwbis are cast into the fire with 
the seven mantras beginning with Van me mata' (in Ap. M. P. 
]X 19. 1-7), the first two for the father, the next two for the 
grand-father, next two for the great-grand-father and the 7th 
to pitrs in general with svaha (but without naming any one) 
and then six oblationB of clarified butter are offered with the six 
formulas beginning with 'svaha pitre' (Ap. M. P. EL 19 8-13). 
Thus the agnaukarana in Ap consists of two parts viz. ahutis 
of food and of clarified butter, while in Asv it is made only with 
food. Then the performer should touch a]] food (cooked food 
and the remainder of what is employed for offering into fire ) 
with the three mantras *esa te tata madhumsn' (Ap M. P. H. 
19 14-16), he should make the brshmanas touch the food served 
to each with the Yajus formula 'the earth is thy vessel* (Ap. 
M. P. 3. 20. 1) quoted in n. 992 below. 

Ap gr prescribes the mantra, 'putran pautran' (Ap. M. P. 
IL 80 24) for moistening the pindas, while Baud. gr. and 
Vaikhanasa gr. QV. 6) employ the mantra 'urjam vahantfr 
(Vaj.S.n.34) for the same purpose. It ma y be noted that

IV] Parvava-srUddlia in others sutras 439 

these sutras "which belong to the Taittirlya sakha employ a 
verse from another recension vis. the Sukla Yajurveda. 

The Hir. Gr. (II. 10-13) is more elaborate than the Ap. Gr. 
and not only sets out at length many of the mantras in Ap, 
M. P. H. 19-20, but adds some more. The Sraddhasutra of 
Eatyayana (1-3) sets out the procedure of the monthly sraddha 
almost in the same way as the Yajfiavalkyasmrti (which is set 
out below). It states that in the monthly sraddha first come 
the daiva rites and then the various items occur as in the 
Finda-pitryajna 'pindapitryajna-vad-upacaxah' (first sutra of 
the 2nd kandika) Some details which it contains (and Y&j. 
does not expressly mention) may be set out here. It gives in 
full the mantras 'tilosi', 'ya divya' (both of -which occur in 
Asv. gr.), 'prthivl to patram ' (which is Sp. M. P. IL 20.1). It 
prescribes that in addition to the Gayatrl and the MadhumatI 
verses the word 'madhu' should be repeated thrice. The holy 
texts to be repeated while the brahmanas are engaged in eating 
according to Eatyayana are the Gayatrl (once or thrice) the 
rive Raksoghnl verses (Bg. IV. 4. 1-5, Vaj. S. XIU. 9-13, Tai. S 
I 2. 14. 1-2), Purusasukta, the Apratiratha hymn (Re 2 iW 
1-13 = Vs 3 . S. 17. 33-34, 46 = Tai. S. IV. 6. 4 1-4) and others' 
It expressly states that the svadhavUcana (Taj. I 244) relates to 
both paternal and maternal ancestors. Besides the blessing 
contained in Yaj I 246, Eatyayana provides that the performer 
is to pray for and the brahmanas are to pronounce two more 
viz. May the pitrs be kind (lit not dreadful ) to us • and « May 
our family prosper'. Dr Caland in his learned work « Altindi- 
scher Ahnenculf (pp. 150-152) appears inclined to hold that 
whenasutrakarahas not actually said anything on certain 
items m the sraddha ritual, one has no right to anticipate, on 
2ET5S J plater authors, that those items existed in tne 
times of that sutrakara. I demur to this conclusion Dr Galand

as the procedure prescribed by the YajBavalkyasmrti (I. 325-249) 
is more compact and at the same time more lucid it is set out 
here. "When the invited brahmanas come in the afternoon the 
performer having a pavdra 9 * 2 in his hand should seat them on 
seats and make them sip water. The brahmanas invited should 
he even in number (2, 4 &c.) according to the performer's re- 
sources at the daiva rite (i e. the Yaisvadevika brahmanas 
should be two, four &c.) and uneven (three or five &c.) at a 
{pSrvana) sraddha for the pttrs; the brahmanas should be 
seated in a pure (eowdunged) plot screened on all side3 and 
sloping towards the south. At the daiva (part of parvsna- 
srsddha when Visve-devah are to be invoked ) two brahmanas 
facing the east should sit down and three brahmanas facing 
the north should be seated in the rite for the pifcrs or only- 
one may be seated for each (i. e. in dmui and in pitrya). 
The same rule applies to a sraddha for maternal ancestors. In 
both (pitrsrsddha and matamahasraddha) the worship of Visve- 
devas may be performed separately or simultaneously 9SJ . Then

procedure laid down for Pindapitryajfia. He, being intent (ordv 
on performing sraddha correctly), should serve the food that 
remains after (making the two offering* mentioned above) in 
Plates (except earthen one) that he may he able to secure, and 
particularly Bilver oness (plates aTe meant for feeding pitrya 
brahmanas). After serving the food in the plates, he should invoke 
over the plates the mantra 'the earth is thy»2 support', he should 
take hold of the thumb of the brahmanas and put it on the food 
(served in the plates) with the mantra 9 " 'idam Visum-' (Visim 
strode over this' $g. I 22. 17, Vaj. S. V. 15, Tai S. 1. 2. 13. 1). The 
performer should then mutter the Gayatrl verse (Bg. HI 63. 
10, Vfc]. §. TIL. 35, Tai. S. 1. 5. 6. 4) together with 'Om' and the 
'Vyahrtis' and the three verses beginning with 'Madhu vats' 
($g. I 90. 6-8, Vaj. S. 13. 27-29, Tai. S IV. 2 9. 3), he should 
say 'partake (of the food) as you please ' and the brabmanas 
also should eat the food silently. He should serve without 
anger or bustle food fit for being offered as tools (in a sraddha) 
and liked by the brahmanas till they are satiated (so that some 
food is left in their plates) and should repeat (while the brah- 
manas are engaged in eating) sacred texts and the texts for 
Jqpa (Gayatri &c. already referred to in Yfij I 239 above). 
The sacred texts to be repeated according to the Mife onYaj. 
I. 240 are the Furusasukta (Bg. X. 90.* 1-16), the PavamanI 
verses (i. e'. verses like 'svadisthaya madisthaya' from the 
9th mandala of the Bgveda as stated by Medhatithi on Manu 
HI 86 and Haradatta on Gautama (19. 12). Manu EL 23,3 
mentions other works for recitation such as the dharmasastras, 
aWajanas, itihSsa (Mahabharata), puranas and khilas (like 
Srlsukta and Vidyasakta). There is great divergence of views 
about the sacred texts to be recited by the performer in a low

japd of sacred texts is to be done by tbe performer wearing the 

sacred thread in the upavita way as stated by Hemadri p. 1070 

and the Madana-parijata p. 599, but the Sr&ddhatattva (p. 231) 

is opposed to this and relies on Manu IH. 279. Certain verses 

from the Puranas also are to be recited such as the verses 

from the Varahapurana (14. S6-31) and Visnupurana (HE. 15. 

31-36, which are identical with the preceding) quoted by 

the Kalpataru on sraddha (p. 197), Apararka (p. 502) and 

Hemadri (on sraddha p. 109), the first and last of which are 

quoted in the note below m . The Garudapurana (Acarakhanda 

218.20 ff.)prescribes that while the brahmanas are eating one may 

recite a eulogy of pitrs such as the 'saptavyadha' verses 99 * . 

Then, after holding the food in his hands, the performer should 

ask the brahmanas 'are you satisfied' (and after they reply that 

they are satisfied) he should tell them that there is food still left 

(and ask them what to do with it) and after taking their per-

56-57. The story is very clearly set out in 5f*%5T 1. chapters 21-24 and 

the Matsyapurana chap 20-21. Seven pupils of Garga guarding their 

guru's cow thought of eating that cow as they were famished. But the 

youngest said 'let us make use of the cow's flesh in sraddha. so that we may 

be saved from sin '. Two of the brothers became daiva brahmanas, three 

became pitr-brahmanas, one became the giver and the 7th became a guest. 

They told the guru that the cow was eaten by a tiger They passed through 

several births first as seven hunters, then deer in Kalanjara hill and so on 

Sraddha ultimately saved them. The same story is narrated inPadma 

V. 10.49-125, andV. 47.282-304 (in which last the disciples are said to 

have been those of n(&g ) After becoming hamsas three of them became 

kings (a king and two ministers, ace. to JR^r) and cared not for the other 

world. The four others knew the path to moksa, sent word to the three 

with these verses saying that they four had started on the long road to the 

other world (ifRsjHT ..erR ) and asking the other three not to be immersed in 

the mire of wordhness (sgv.»3n). The story also occurs in the i»Ha«"f 

(y«l%it?dTchap. 41.24 ff). It is interesting to note that in the Jain'a 

TJttaradhyayana-sutra (S. B, E vol. 45 p 55) the echoes of this story of the 

brothers are heard for illustrating the influence of karman,

Many of the Puranas contain detailed descriptions of the 
sraddha to he performed on every amavasya; for example, 
Matsyal7. 12-60 (closely resembling Yaj. 325-259), Visnu- 
puranaHT. 15. 13-49, Markandeya 28 37-60, Kurma (EL 22. 
20-62), Padma (srstikhanda) 9. 140-186), Brahmanda (Upod- 
gh&tapada, cbap. 12), Skanda VT. 224. 3-^51, VfsnudhannofcGara 
1 140. 6-44. The Agoipurana chap. 163 verses 2-42 are the 
same (with very slight variations and the omission of 2| verses) 
as Yaj. J. 227-270; while Agni chap. 117 contains many verses 
that closely follow the Asv. Gr and Yaj. Similarly the Garnda- 
purana contains numerous verses that are identical with 
Yajnavalkya's. For example, compare Yaj. J. 229-239 with 
Garuda I. 99. 11-19. ThB Puranas closely follow the Grhya- 
sutras, Manu and Yajnavalkya and often employ the same 
mantras and formulas, though here and there they introduce 
some details. As remarked by the Varahapurana 1451, the 
procedure for sraddha is the same in all Puranas ( iyam sarva- 
puranesu samanya paitrikl kriy S ). For sample, a summary of 
the procedure in the Padma (srsti 9. 140-186) is set out here. 
The performer having honoured the Visve-devSh (i e. the brah- 
mana or brahmanas invited to represent them) with a seat ana 
with yava grains and flowers should fill two vessels with water 
and should place them on a pavUra of darWux The water should 
L offered with the verse 'sam no devV (Sg. X 9 4) ^and he 
yava grains with «Yavosi'. They^should be «^ ^ *f

he should honour them with water with the verse loot 'ya. divya' 
(vide n. 985). After taking leave of the Vaisvadeva hrahmanas 
that have been honoured with arghya be should begin the pitr 
yajfia. He should prepare seats with darbhas on them, worship 
three vessels, place pavitras on them and pour water in them with 
' sam no devlr * ($g. X 9 4), should oast sesamum grains in them 
with 'tilosi' and then put in them sandalwood and flowers. 
(Then verses 147-152 speak about the vessels to be employed). 
He then should announce the names and gotra of his ancestors 
and give darbhas in the hands of the hrahmanas. He should 
then request hrahmanas with the words 'I shall invite the pitrs ' 
and when they reply 'let it be so' he should invoke the pitrs 
with the two verses 'usantas tva' (Rg. X. 16.12) and 'a yantu' 
(Vaj. S. 19.58). Then, having offered aighya to the hrahmanas 
(representing the pitrs) with .' ya divya ' (vide n. 985), having 
given them sandalwood paste and the other things inoluding 
garment as the last, he should collect the remainder of the 
water ( in the arghya vessels ) into the vessel meant for the 
father and should keep aside the latter to the north with its 
top turned downwards with the words 'thou art a seat of the 
pitrs'. Then he should begin to serve various kinds of food 
after bringing the utensils in which the food was cooked and 
holding them with both hands. ( Verses 157-165 speak of the 
various foods to be offered and the periods of gratification 
caused thereby to the pitrs ). While the hrahmanas are engag- 
ed in eating he should recite the Yedic hymns 100S referring to

The performer holding a vessel fall of water and muttering the

should touch the brahmanas with the tip of kusas and dismiss 
them. He should follow them out of Ms house for eight paces, 
should circumambulate them, should then return with his rela-

tlie several items found in other sutras and smrtis though not 
included in the kalpa or grhya sutra of his own Sakha. This 
topic is discussed at great length by Hemadri ( on srsddha ) 
pp. 748-759 and briefly by Medhatithi on Manu It 29 and XX 216, 
by the Mit on Yaj. ILL 325, Apararka p. 1053 and others. Those 
who are for strictly following the details in one's own sutra 
alone argue as follows : If one were at liberty to include details 
other tban those contained in'one*s own sutra, the order of the 
details ( hama ) given in one's sutra and the time specified for 
each detail would be interfered with Besides, if the addition 
of details were permissible, one would be liable to the charge of 
giving up the usages of one's own family handed down for 
generations. These objectors rely upon such passages as that 
of the "Visnudharinottara which states * He who violating ( the 
dictates of ) his own sutra acts according to a sutra meant for 
others, treats thereby his own sage ( the author of his sutra ) as 
unauthoritative and incurs (the blame of) doing what is im- 
proper.' 1 " The smrtis that contain additional details may be 
meant for those men who have no Jcalpa or grhya sutra of their 
own or they may be useful for siidras. 

Those who espouse the view that as far as possible all details 
found in several grhyasutras and smrfcis on one rite should 
be included by every one rely mainly on Jaimini H. 4. 8-33 which 
is called 'sakhsntaradhifcarananyaya' or 'sarvasakhapratyaya- 
nyaya. The principal sutra is Jai. II. 4. 9.'°" It is established 
in this sutra that the pmgmaa{ purpose) or pliala (reward to 
be secured) of the rite is the same in different sutras and smrtis 
For example, the rewards of sraddha are stated to be the same 
mall sutras and smrtis (vide notes 787-790 above); then the 
dravva (materials) and the deity are the same (in Parvanci 
sraddnath e deities are the paternal ancestors and the materials,

works). TJio effort that is enjoined (the vidh) is the same and 
the name (Put vatfairuddka, Efcoddista sraddha &c) is the same. 
TJiorofore, on account of those various signs one easily recog- 
nizes that the same rite is being dealt with by all sutras, even if 
many of them differ in dotailB. It cannot be said that smrtis 
Will bo useful for those who have no sutras of their own. Each 
man of the first three varnas is attached to some sutra or other 
by tho tradition of his family or caste, Similarly, the smrtis 
cannot bo hold to be meant for sudras alone, since the smrtis 
mainly deal with upanayana, the study of the Vedas, agniMra 
and other matters with which a sildra has no concern. Similar- 
ly, the objection that if dotails were allowed to be inserted from 
other sutras and smrtis tho Icrama and IMa prescribed in one's 
sutra might have to be set aside, the reply is contained in Jai. 
I 3. 5-7 (explained at great length in H. of Dh. voL HI 
pp. 841-848 ). im The iruli says ' after getting ready a bundle 
of kusa grass he prepares the vedi (altar)'. Here a certain 
order of acts is laid down. If after a bundle of kusas is got 
ready, the man has a sneeze, he has to sip water (perform 
ucamctna ) immediately as laid down by Manu V. 145 and Vas. 
HI 38 before he prepares the vedi. So the objector says the 
krama will be interfered witb. The reply is that the sequence

E Satis meant is that the making of the altar f ol ows

ggnihotra and the like'. " 13 The first verse of Katysyana may 

be explained as applying where one's sakha or sutra deals with. 

a matteT without requiring any addition or as the next beat 

oourse where one is not able to supplement one's sutra owing 

to some unseen cause or owing to human difficulties. The 

Sangraha says that where different items of the Sraddha rite 

are declared to be performed at different times and there is no 

agreement among the sages, one should follow one's grhya- 

sutra, but where one's grhyasutra is silent as to a certain item 

or.as to the stage when it is to be performed, there is an option 

and one may follow the opinion of some sage as to that item. 1014 

It appears that even the ancient grhya sutras exhibit tendencies 

that led to the sarvasakha-pratyaya-nyaya e. g. Asv. gr. 

( q. in n 966 ) employs several passages ( such as ' Tilosi ', ' Ya 

divya,' which do not occur in the Bgveda.) 

It is owing to this maxim of ' sarvasakha-pratyayanyaya ' 
that medieval digests go on heaping up details from all smrtis 
and puranas in their descriptions of the several sraddhas, the 
procedures of which were not originally very extensive. 

The Eurmapurana 10ls provides that the performer should 
before noontime is past bring to his house the invited brahmanas

who have shaved themselves and pared their nails, should offer 
them materials for brushing the teeth and request them to sit 
down on separate seats, then give them oil and water for 
bathing. It will he seen that here the purana has added several 
details that were not provided for by the Ssv. gr. (n, 966), 
Manu (III. 208 ), Yaj. (1 226) and even by some of the puranas 
such as the VarSha 14. 8, which begin the procedure with seat- 
ing the brahmanas in the afternoon on seats after welcoming 
them. Many more examples could be given, but that attempt 
is not made owing to considerations of space. 

Before proceeding to give some idea as to how the parvana- 
sraddha was dealt with in medieval and modern times, observa- 
tions must be made on several relevant matters, on which there 
is a difference of views or which are important in a general 
way. 

When the invited brahmanas come after noon, it is pro- 
vided in some of the puranas that two mandates should be made 
in front of the performer's residence for receiving the brah- 
manas. For example, the Naradapurana states 1016 ' the mandala 
for a brahmana performer should be square (four cornered) in 
size, for a ksatriya triangular, circular for a vaisya and for a 
sudra mere sprinkling of the ground with water is enough.' The 
mandates should be made on ground smeared with cowdung and 
with water mixed with cow's urine. Of the two maDdalas one 
should be on the northern side sloping towards the north and 
the other on the southern side sloping towards the south. On 
the northern mandala kusas with points towards the east should 
be placed along with aksata (unbroken or whole) grains and on 
southern one double-folded kusas should be placed along with 
sesamum grains. The northern mandala **™\&™£**« 
two cubits on each side while the southern one should be f^r 
cubits on each side. The brahmana or brahmanas that repre- 
£m fZ nsvedevah should be honoured in the "^ "!**

give the water to the Vaisvadeva brahman as and to the pitrya 
bsShmanas as noted below (m n.1017). After the padya water is 
offered the brahmanas should come in front of the mandalas 
and sip water ( take Ucamnm ). 

The ancient sutras and smrfcis like those of Manu and Yaj. 

(I. 229) say generally that the Visvedevah are to be invoked, 

but some of the later srmtis (such as Prajapati, verses 179-190) 

and purSnas contain verses enumerating ten names of Visve- 

devas and assign two each (out of the ten) to five classes of 

sraddhas They say: 10 '* "in sraddha performed in an »§fo' the 

Vi&vedvvas are Kratu andDaksa, in a Nandlmukha sraddha 

they are Vasu and Satya, in Kamyasraddha Dhuri and Looana, 

innaimittika sraddha Kala and Kama and in Parvana-srSddha 

Pnruravas and Ardrava*. According to the Sm. 0. and Hemadri 

a seat (Usana) is to be given to the Vaisvadeva brahmanas and 

invocations are to be made in the several sraddhas after taking 

the names enumerated above. The Mit on Yaj L. 329, Hemadri 

(on sraddha p. 1225) and other digests state that the mantras

Brhaspati says : 'when giving a seat, when offering arghya, or 
pindas, in offering ablutions of water on pindas, the performer 
has to declare his relation to each of the ancestors, the names 
and gotras of the ancestors and also the form in which each of 
the ancestors is to be contemplated (viz as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya

employed for the ancestor's name in offering a seat ( to the 
pitrya brahmana) and aksayyodalca, the objective in invoking 
thepitrs, the dative in offering food, the vocative in other 
cases. 

It is laid down that the performer has to take acamana (sip

An important question which exercised the minds of many 
medieval writers was* who was the real recipient (sampradSna)*® 3 
of tho offerings roodo in sraddha, whether the brahmaDas or the 
pitrs'. Relying on the words of the JLsv. gr. IV, 8. 1 (quoted above 
in n. 966 'otasmin kale ... dSnam) and passages of the puranas 
such a<3 tho VarSha (13. 51) 'vibhave sati viprebhyo asman 
uddisya dSsyati', the Maharnavaprakasa, Harihara and some 
others held that brahmanas were the recipients, while others 
like Sridatta, relying on indications furnished by irutt passages 
like Vsj. S. 19. 36 (akqan pitarah amfmadanta pitarah) and such 
formulas as 'pitar-etat te argliwm' or 'eladidh pitaro vasdh,' 
hold that tho real recipients intended were the pitrs, but, as 
tho pitrs had gone to another world and could not be bodily 
present to receive the gifts of such things as sandlewood paste, 
flowers and clothes, tho latter were only handed over or assigned 
to the brahmanas who were for the moment contemplated as 
not different from tho pitrs. 10 *" Vide Sm. 0. < sraddhapp. 447- 
449 ), Sr. Pr. pp. 30-31 for a discussion of these two view- 
points. It should, however, be noted that the water given to the 
brahmanas and the dak&na given to them were only meant for 
tho brahmanas, the former for purification and the latter for 
the inexhaustible merit that daksina to brahmanas conferred. 

It is to be noted that in the invocation (avSliana) of the 
pitrs there is a divergence of views as to the mantras to be 
employed and also as to the stage when it is to be mad*. 
HeLdri (sraddha, pp. 1254-56) states that there were fiv 
different views on the latter point, the three most ™portant 
of which were that avaliana should come before givtag darbhas

permission from the brshmanas should invite the Manes. 
Having driven away the Yatudhanas (demons) by strewing 
grains of sesamum and by reciting the two mantras (the first 
of which begins with 'may the Asuras go away*) he should 
invite the Manes with the four mantras 'come near, ye Manes > *, 
* conduct them here, O Agni ! \ * May my ( ancestors ) come 
near', 'this is your (share), O s Manes'. Hemadri (sraddha 
pp. 1360-1267 ) points out how the mantras differ according to 
different writers. 

There is a great deal of discussion about agnaukarana men- 
tioned in Yaj. I. 336-237. The Mit points out that if a man 
has kept srauta fires by the sarvadhuna method then in the 
parvana-'sradaha that he offers after pindapitryajSa he offers 
homa in the Daksinagni, as he" has no aupasana ( i. e. grhya ) 
fire and supports this by quoting a passage which occurs in the 
Visnudharmottara-purana. M2s But if a man consecrates the 
srauta fires by the ardhsdhana 1026 method, then he has to offer 
parvana homa in the aupasana fire and one who is without 
srauta fires and has kept up only aupasana fire has to offer 
Jioma in that fire. One who has neither the srauta fires nor 
the grhya fire offers it in the hrahmana's hand only. The Mit. 
relies on Manu IK. 212 and on two verses from a grhya and 
comes to the conclusion that one who has consecrated srauta 
fires performs homa in daksina fire in the case of Anvastakya 
sraddha, the sraddha on the day previous to Astaka, the sraddha

performed In tho dark half of each month on soma day from the 
5th and in the case of pSrvana-sraddha, but he performs, in the 
case of hatnya, Sbbyudayika, Ekoddista and Astaka sraddhas, 
homo, only on the pitrya brahmana's hand ; while for one who 
has kept no saored fire the liama is to be made only in the pitrya 
brahmana's band. Vide Hemadri ( sraddha pp. 1328-1344 ), 
BalambhattI ( on acara p. 518 ). The Todarananda (sraddha- 
saukbya ) following Manu 1H 382 states that one who ia an 
Agnihotrin cannot perform a parvana-sraddha on any day except 
on daria ( i. e, on amavasya ). 

Another important question on which there is great diver- 
gence concerns the number of ahutis to be offered in agnatt- 
Icarana, the deities to whom the homa was to be offered, the 
order in which the deities were to be named and the form of 
words to be used. On these matters there appears to have been 
divergent views from very ancient times. According to the 
Sat. Br. H 4. 2. 12-13 the abutis were only 10 * 7 two, they were 
offered to Agni and Soma in that order and the word svaha was 
used at the end. According to the Tai. Br 1 3. 10. 2-3 *» the 
fihutis were three, they were to be offered to Soma, Agni and to 
Yama in that order and the formula ended with 'svadha namah' 
( and not with ' svaha '). It is therefore that a verse of Katya- 
yana ,025 says " whether to employ the word 'svaha' or the words 
•svadha namah '.whether and when to weaT the sacred chord 
intheyajSopavItaformorpraclnavltaform and what was to 
he the number of ahutis-all these have to be understood from 
one's own sOtra." The difference of views which is noticed as 
far back as the Brahmanas persists in the sutras, smrtis, 
purEas and is briefly indicated here. The Ap. Or 8. (■ Quoted 
ahove in n. 981 ) speaks of thirteen ahutis, seven with food and

six with clarified butter. Two ahutis only are mentioned by Sir, 
Srauta II. 6. 12 (quoted in note 974), Asv. gr. IV. 7. 20, Sankha- 
Likhita, 1030 Kathaka-grhya, Narad a-purSna ( puivardha 28. 48 ) 
and Markandeya-purana. Three ahutis are mentioned by most 
of the smrfcia and puranas, such as Baud. Dh. S. H. 14. 7, I031 
Saa Srauta IV. 3 and grhya IV. 1. 13, Visnn Dh. S. 73, 12, Manu 
H3. 211, Varahapurana 1032 (14. 21-22), Brahman da-purana ( Upod- 
ghatapadall. 93-94), Visnudharmottara I. 140. 19. It is here 
that various combinations of the order of the deities and of the 
words 'svaha* and 'svadha' occur. The texts of a few works are 
cited below for illustration. Some give the order as 'Soma accom- 
panied by the pitrs, Agni the carrier of kavya, Tama Ahgiras;' 
while others give it as 'Agni the carrier of hivua, Soma 
accompanied by the pitrs, Yama Vaivasvata &c.* It is further 
provided that the Uhuh to Agni is made to the southern side of 
the fire, to Soma on the northern part of it and in the middle of 
the two sides to Vaivasvata (Yama ). 1033 

Various rules of etiquette about serving food, about the 
way brahmanas are to eat and related matters have been laid 
down from ancient times and are observed even now. The Sm. 
( p. 465-470 ),Hemadri(siaddha pp. 1367-1384), the Sr. Pr. 
pp. 116-123 and other digests contain elaborate rules on these 
matters. Y5]. L 237 prescribes that what remains after offering 
homa should be served in the plates meant for the brahmanas 
representing the Fathers and the plates should preferably be

( either srauta or smarta ) should offer the homa on the hand of 
the most eminent among the pifcrya brahmanas to the accom- 
paniment of a mantra and should offer the remainder in the 
plates of the other pitrya brahmanas. 1031 The Sm. 0. notes that 
ITama and the Vayupurana say that the homa should be in the 
hand of the daiva brahmana and that on account of this conflict 
there is an option. It is further provided that a portion of the 
food from which agnaukarana was effected should be kept aside 
for making pindas (Markandeya and Garuda). The food should 
be served by the performer Mm3elf wearing the sacred thread

IV] Rules about setving food 465 

side dishes viz. broths, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee and honey 

on the ground ( and not on a wooden stool or the like ). The 

vessels placed on the ground should contain various kinds of 

food ( such as sweetmeats, paiyasa ), fruits and roots, delicious 

flesh, spiced or perfumed drinks. Having brought near the 

brahmanas all the vessels containing food, he should serve it in 

the plates declaring the characteristic of each kind of food 

( saying « this is sweet, this is sour ' &c). The performer while 

serving should not shed tears ( remembering his ancestors ), 

he should not become angry, should not utter falsehood, he 

should not touch the ( vessel containing ) food with his foot 

and should not serve food with a violent jerk. Whatever is 

liked by the brahmanas should be served to them without any 

grumbling and he should talk about Brahma ( or about Vedic 

riddles ), because that is agreeable to the pitrs. The performer 

himself, being pleased, should ( by his sweet speech ) gladden 

the brahmanas, should make them partake of food without 

hurry, and should urge them on frequently (to take more food) 

by declaring the good points of the various items of food. All 

food should be steaming hot and the brahmanas should partake 

of it silently and should not themselves speak gf the good points 

of the food even when questioned by the performer. When the 

food is hot, when the brahmanas eat in silence and when the 

good qualities of the food are not declared by the brahmanas, the 

Fathers paTtake of it. When a brahmana (at a sraddha dinner) 

partakes of food, having his head covered with a garment ( a 

turban &c)or facing the south or having his sandals on, evil 

spirits partake of the food (and not the Fathers).' As early as 

Gaut., it is provided that the food for the brahmanas should 

be of the highest sort and should be enriched by condiments 

and flavoured. 

Some of the other rules are : The Prajapati-smrti ( verses 
57-62 ) states who should cook the food for the sraddha dinner. 
The wife, any fortunate (or handsome) woman of the performer's 
gotra whose husband is living and who haB a son or brother 
and is devoted to waiting upon her elders, the performer's 
teacher's wife, his maternal uncle's wife, paternal or maternal 
aunt, hiB sister, his daughter or daughter-in-law, all of them 
having their husbands alive, should engage in the cooking of 
the food for sraddha. Women of good family, who have a large 
progeny, whose husbands are alive and who are about BO years 
old or these women if they have become widows, and the wife 
of one*B paternal uncle or brother, one's mothers ( natural or 
h. d, 5a 



466 History of bhaima&astra [Vol. 

slop-mothers ) and tho mothers of one's father may cook the 
•■raddlia food and also a woman of the same gotra who is mild 
!>y tompor. In the Auusasana parva (92.15) it is stated that a 
woman belonging to a gotra other than that of the deceased 
should not bo employed for cooking sraddha food. One's brother, 
paternal uncle, brother's son, sister's son, one's son, pupil, one's 
daughter's son or daughter's husband may also engage in cook- 
nig tho sraddha food, but not a woman who wears a white and 
wet garment, who has let her hair loose, who does not wear 
a bodico, who is ill or who has bathed her head. Before the 
brahmanas begin to oat, the food should bB first served in 
tho plates for tho Vaisvadeva brahmanas and then in those of 
Iho jnliira brahmanas (Vismi Dh S. 73 13-14), but once the 
brahmanas havo begun to eat there is no such precedence, what- 
ever each brahmana may bo noted as requiring should be served 
to him ( as indicated by Mann lit 331 ). The performer of the 
sraddha when serving food to the brahmanas (including pitrya) 
wears his sacred thread in the upavlta form Though it is said 
that tho food should be hot, that does not apply to such eatables 
as curds, fruits and roots and flavoured 1035 drinks ( as Sankha 
X1V.13 and Skandapurana say ) As Hemadri (sraddha p. 1371) 
points out, the serving of food in a sraddha rite should be done 
with the right hand supported by the left; besides, nothing 
should bo served with tho bare hand or with a single hand, but 
with a wooden ladle or other utensil ( but not an iron one ). All 
cooked food, all sidd dishes and ghee should be served with a 
ladle (and not with the bare hand; but not water or eatables 
likeforfliu No salt waste be directly served (Vfenu Dh S, 
79 12) In Katyayana's Sraddha-sutra it is provided 103 ^ The 
food that remains after agnaul.arana should be served in the

each plate for those brahmanas after repeating the mantra ' the 
earth is thy vessel, the sky is the cover, I offer nectar in the 
brahmana's nectar-like mouth; svaha '. Then the performer 
plunges the (-right ) thumb of the pitrya brahmana in the food 
( the remains of the homa in fire ) with the rk or yajus 
addressed to Visnu ; and after scattering sesamum grains all 
round the place where the dinner is to go on with the mantra 
' the asuras and raksasas ) are struck and driven away ' he 
( the performer ) should serve hot food very much liked { by the 
departed or by the brahmanas )". Yaj. I. 238 briefly refers ( as 
translated above ) to the mantras and the item of plunging the 
thumb of the brahmanas in the food; and so does the Baud. Dh. 
S. also (H. 8. 15-16). The Kalika-purana prescribes 1037 that the 
thumb of the brahmana should be moved about in the food 
covered with ghee and hqjiey with the mantra ' the earth is thy 
vessel &o.' because Visnu in the form of the thumb protects 
food meant for sacrifices to gods and manes. The Baud. 
Pitnnedhasutra provides that while plunging the thumb of the 
brahmana in the food served it should be so arranged that the 
nail of the thumb is not smeared with food. 1033 Vasistha 
provides that the brahmanas eating sraddha food should always 
hold the plate from which theyare eating with ( the left ) hand 
til] the end of the dinner. Sankha-Likhita provide 1039 that 
brahmanas ( eating sraddha food ) should not declare the good 
or bad points of the food served, should not say what is untrue, 
should not praise each other, nor should they say ' there is 
plenty of food and drink ( and so do not serve more food ),

except by signs made with the hand.' Whatever is offered in a 
bruhmana's hand ( by way of agnaukarana ) and whatever food 
is placed in tho plates should be mixed up and eaten. Hemadri 
quotes passages from the Maitrayaniya-sutra and from the 
SIcandapurana sotting out . tho mantras wherewith certain 
articles were to bo served; e. g, the Skandapurana Bays that 
ptiyasa should bo served with tho verse 'namo vahpitaTo' 
{ Vaj. S. n. 33. Tai. S. IH 2. 5. 5 ), clarified butter with the 
mantra * Tojosi suit ram *, curds with the mantra ' dadhikravno ' 
(Be. IV. 39. 6, Yaj. S. 23. 32, Tai. S. 1. 5. 11. 4 ). Ap Dh. & (II 
8, 18. 11) pro\ ides that tho havings of a sraddha dinner should 
not be given to ono who is inferior to the invited brahmanas 
in qualitios and Mantt m. 249 states that the man who after 
oating sraddha dinnor"give9 the leavings to a sudra falls in the 
Kalasutra Hell. • 

The Matsyapurrma and some other works provide that the 
brahmanas should pronounce blessings on the performer (who 
faces the oast ) after they have sipped, water and have been given 
water, flowers and alexia grains. The performer prays 'May 
our Fathers bo not terrible (i. e. be kind) to us,' The brahmanas 
reply 'lot it be so'. The performer prays 'May our family 
grow', ' May donors increase in our family and also food ', 'May 
these blessings turn out to be true '. To all these the brahmanas 
reply after each one of the prayers"" 'May it be so'. There 
aro rules about the time when the leavings or particles of food 
in the plates of the brahmanas that ate the dinner should be 
removed or swept away Vas. (XI 21-32) and the Kurma- 
TflufittB provide that the leavings of food should not be removed 
till the Sun sets, since streams of nectar flow from them, which 
are drunk by the (spirits of ) those departed persons for whom 
no water was offered. Mantt 3D. 265 {which is the same as 
MateyaVSandPadma, Srstikhanda 9.185) provides another 
rub that the leavings of the food in the *ta "V £»»

Hemadri (sraddha, p. 1512 ) 1M1 therefore provides that if the per- 
former has another house the leavings may not be removed till" 
sunset, but if he has only one house, they may be removed after 
the brabtnanas have gone away ( vide Ya] I. 257, Matsya 17.56 ). 
It is further provided by Brhaspati 1042 that the plates should 
not be removed before the brahmanas pronounce the word 
'svasti'j and Jatukarnya 1013 and the Skandapurana say that the 
plates and the leavings should be removed by the performer 
himself or by his pupil or son, but not by women nor by a child 
nor by one who is not of the same caste Manu III 258 provides 
that, after the brahmanas have left, the performer should look at 
the south and pray to the pitrs for certain blessings contained 
in Manu ID, 259 which are the same as Yaj I 246 translated 
above_(vide p. 447>), Visnu Dh. S 73. 28, Matsya 16. 49-50. 
The Ap. gr. 209 (q. in note 981), Ap Dh. S H 7.17.16, 
Manu HL 264, Yaj. I. 249 provide that the performer should 
partake of the remainder of the food cooked for the sraddha 
along with his wife, paternal and maternal relatives after recit- 
ing (according to Haradatta) the Yajusa mantra ( Ap. M. P. II. 
20.26 ) which means ' entering the life breath I offer nectar ; my 
soul is centred in Brahman for the sake of immortality.' The 
Ap. gr and Ap. Dh. B. provide 104 * that the performer must eat 
at least a morsel of the food left after serving to the brahmanas. 
Vyasa and Devala prescribe that on the day of sraddha the per- 
former must not observe a fast (even if he usually does so as on 
EkadasiorSivaratra). Away out was provided by the Bra- 
hmavaivarfea-purana by recommending that the performer 
should merely smell the remnants of the srSddha food Vide

Homadri ( sraddha, pp. 1519-1521 ) for the discussion. HemadrJ 
(p. 1485) refers to the practice (observed even now) that after 
the performer receives tho blessings referred to above, hia son) 
grandson nnd the like should offer adoration to the dewtas in 
Iho form of pindas. Tho brahmanas should praise the good 
characteristics of tho food served at the end of the st&ddka 
coremony. ,01S The brahmanas should not get up from the 
dinner, carelessly leaving remnants of food in their plates, but 
they may leave in tho plates a little food except milk, curds, 
honey or barley flour. 1016 

There were soveral views as to the exact stage at which the 
offerings of pindas wero to be made. According to San. Gr. 17. 
1.9., Asv. gr. IV. 8. 12, 1W Sankha 14. 11, Manu HI. 260-261, 
Yfg.I 242 and several other works, the performer offers the lumps 
of boiled rice aftor tho brahmanas have finished eating their 
dinner. The pindas aro made with boiled rice mixed with sesame 
and aro placed on dorbhas on a clean spot and at a distance 
of about one aratni from 1MS the plates in which the brahmanas 
ate and the performer faces the south. Here again there are two 
opinions, one being that pindas were to be offered before the 
brahmanas sip water (perform acamana) after dinner (e. g. Asv. 
cr IV 8 12-13, Sraddha-siitra of Katyayana, kandiks 3), while 
othors'bo'ld that they were to be offered after the brahmanas have 
rinsed their mouth and taken acamana. Another view referred

IV] Time of offeiing pindas 471 

Brahmandapuri.na 1019 emphatically asserts that this is the 
correct position as stated by Brhaspati. The Visnu Dh. S. (73 
15-24) provides that the pindas are to be 'offered to the ancestors 
while the brahmanas are actually eating. A fourth view is that 
of the Ap. gr. 24.9, Hir gr. (H 12.2-3) which state that the per- 
former 1050 should, after the brahmanas have eaten and gone away 
and he has followed and circumambulated them, offer pindas. 
Owing to this conflict of views Hemadri (quoting smrti) and the 
Madanaparijata (p 600) say that each one should follow the 
procedure laid down in his own sakha 10S1 Hemadri adds that 
those in whose grhyasxitra no special time is mentioned for 
pindadana should follow the view that pindas are-to be offered 
after the brahmanas have partaken of the dinner and sipped 
water. The Sr. P. (p. 247) endorses this view. 1032 The pindas 
were to be deposited on bunches of (25) darbhas for each pinda. 
Apararka on Yaj. 1. 24 states that in all cases without exception 
pindas were to be offered near the plates from which the 
brahmanas took their meals, while Hemadri who relies on 
Katyayana's word ' ucchistasannidh.au ' says that where the 
performer is an alutUgni the pindas were to be offered near his 
sacred fire, but when a performer had not kept the sacred fires 
pindas were to be offered near the plates from which brahmanas . 
ate the sraddha food. The Sraddhasara (p 163) quotes Atri to 
the effect that pindas should be offered at a distance of three 
aratms from where the brahmanas ate the sraddha dinner and 
that in such sraddhas as Navasraddhas Vaisvadeva is to be 
performed before pindadana and that it is to be performed after

pindadana in Samvatsarika sraddka, MaMlaya and the like 
(P. 164). 

There is another" conflict of views as regards the ancestors 
to whom pindas are to be offered at the srsddha on amavasya. 
- Most of the ancient Vedic works refer only to the three paternal 
ancestors as the devatas of the Parvana-sraddha and not to any- 
other relatives. The three paternal ancestors are separately 
the deoatas of sraddha and not cumulatively, as indicated by 
the &sv. Srauta TL 6. 15 and Visnu Dh S. 73 13-14, The 
important questions are whether the wives of the paternal 
ancestors, viz. the mother, the grandmother and the paternal 
great-grandmother were associated with their husbands in 
ancient times and secondly, whether the three paternal ancestors 
of one's mother viz. the maternal grandfather, the maternal 
great-grandfather and the maternal great-great-grandfather 
were invoked together with their wives in the Farvana The 
answer to both these questions so far as the Vedas and 
Brahmanas are concerned is in the negative. Vide Tai. S. 1. 8. 
5.1, Tai. Br. I 3. 10, IL 6. 16, V5j. S. 19 36-37, Sat. Br. H 4.2. 
16, in all of which the only persons expressly named are the 
pitrs and three paternal ancestors It may be noted, however, 
tbatinVaj S. 9. 19 {which is cited by Katyayana at the end 
of SrSddhasatra 3 as the mantra to be recited when following 
the brahmanas that are dismissed) there is a clear reference to 
paternal ancestors and also to mothers Almost a)] sutras also 
are silent as regards the invocation of the maternal ancestors 
in Parvana-sraddha along with paternal ones. Vide««A*v. 
Sr • SudarSana on £ P . gr. VUL M. 2 states that the Sutrakara

ancestors. The Gobhilasmrti provides 1055 that six pindas 
should be offe^ except in the Anvastakasraddha, the first 
sraddha (on the 11th day), the sixteen sraddhas and the yearly 
sraddha for a deceased person. Dhaumya 10S6 prescribes that 
where the paternal ancestors are honoured (or fed) the mater- 
nal ancestors also should be certainly honoured without making 
any difference (between the two classes); if he makes a dis- 
tinction the performer will go to Hell. The Visnupurana, 10S7 
the Brahmandapurana arid the VarShapurana say that some 
hold that a sraddha for maternal ancestors is to be performed 
separately while other sages hold that one sraddha is to be 
offered at the same time to the paternal and maternal ancestors. 
Brhaspati (q. by Kalpataru on sraddha p. 20&) prescribes 1058 
that one should offer pindas made from all food cooked for the 
sraddha and mixed with honey and sesamum grains for both 
paternal and maternal ancestors according to the rules of one's 
grhyasutra. The Varahapurana (14 40-41) says that pitrya 
brahmanas should be dismissed first and then the daiva brah-

separate pindas were to be offered to the mother's paternal 
ancestors (14 37). Some held the _ view that the offering of 
pindas to maternal ancestors was obligatory for tne putriJca- 
putra 1019 (son of the appointed daughter) or for a daughter's 
son that inherited the wealth of his maternal grandfather.

daughter as a'son became rare or went out of vogue the maternal 
ancestors came to be associated with the paternal ancestors in 
psrvana- sr&ddha. 

The question when the wives of ancestors became associa- 
ted with the male ancestors cannot be solved satisfactorily. 
The pitamahl is not mentioned in the extant Vedic Literature. 
But it is certain that the wives of male ancestors had come to 
be associated with their husbands in the sutra period. For 
example, the Hir, Gr. II 10 associates the mother, the paternal 
grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother with their 
respective husbands in the monthly sraddha performed in the 
dark half. Similarly, the Baud. gr. TL 11.34 not only associates 
in the Astakg sraddha the male maternal ancestors with the 
male paternal ancestors, but also their respective wives. The 
5.p, M. P. 1060 has mantras referring to the three male paternal 
ancestors as well as their wives. The Ssn. gr. (TV. 1.11} pro- 
vides that behind the lumps for the paternal ancestors the per- 
former places the lumps for their wives, putting something 
between the two sets of pindas and the commentator explains 
that darbhas are placed between the two sets. The Kausika 
sutra (88 12} also provides for the offering of pindas to the 
wives of male ancestors to the south of the pindas for male 
ancestors. The Mr. gr. C& 5. 4-5}, while speaking of the Anvas- 
takya rite, refers to pindas to be offered to ^™7£"5£

IT] Participation of females in pvttdas offered 475 

this item would have figured in all sutras just as Astute. sra- 
ddha does. B is rather more probable that the extension to 
■women was a natural growth in course of time. Some of the 
startis emphasize the participation of the wires of paternal 
ancestors in the panavairaddha offerings. Satstapa states 1062 : 
'In what is offered to the pita after Sapindlfcarana, the mother 
is a participant everywhere. A. sraddha may be separately 
offered to the mother in the AnvastakS rites, in Vrddhi-sraddha, 
at Gaya and on the anniversary of the day of her death; but 
in other cases it is performed along with the husband'. It is 
stated by Brhaspati that the mother partakes of the srsddha 
food along with her husband (Le. the father of the performer) ; 
that the same rule applies to the paternal grandmother and the 
paternal great-grandmother Mfi3 . The Kalpataru v ' u and others 
held that the wives of the paternal ancestors were not deratas 
in the parvana-srSddha, but they only enjoyed the ethereal 
food which came to the pitas, while Hemadri and other sou- 
thern writers held that the mother and other female ancestors 
were among the devatSs of parvana-sraddha, but not the step- 
mother. There was a divergence of views whether the words 
'mother*, 'paternal grandmother* and 'paternal great-grand- 
mother * included the co-wives {sapafnls) of these. Hemadri 
(on sraddha pp. 97-104) has a long disquisition on this Question. 
According to one view the step-mother, the co-wife of the pita- 
mahi and the co-wife of the prapitamahl would be included in

As regards the mantra to ho rooited when offering each of 
the pindaa thore is some divergence of views, which roaclios far 
into antiquity. Tho pinda 1066 is offered to each ancestor aftor 
stating his gotra, his relationship to tho performer and name 
(all in tho vooativo ). According to several writers the form of 
the presentation of the pinda is ' this iB for thee, Father! % 
N. (hy namo) and so and so by gotra.' In tho Tai. S. J. 8.5 1, in 
the Up. M. P. II. 20.13 and in some sutras, tho following is added 
'and for those who follow thoo' (ye ca tvam-anu) ,oW Intlw

the usage of the Tai. S. in this matter, the reason being 10 " that 

when the son offers a pinda to his father and employs the 

formula 'this is thine and of those that follow thee ', he would 

be included among those that follow the father and be thus 

offering a pinda to himself, which is inauspicious. It is provided 

by Gebhila-grhya 1071 that if he does not know the names of his 

ancestors he should put down the first pinda with the Formula 

'svadhatothe Fathers dwelling on the earth', (he should put 

down) the 2nd pinda with the formula 'svadha to the fathers 

dwelling in the air', the third with the formula 'svddha to the 

Fathers dwelling in heaven ' and should recite in a low voice 

the words 'Here, O Fathers, gladden yourselves, show your 

vigour each according to his own part.' Yama quoted by 

Kalpataru (on Sr. p 203), following Gobhila provides generally 

(whether the ancestors be known or not) that the first pinda 

should be offered to the father with the expression 'prthivl', the 

second to the grandfather in the aerial regions and the third to 

the paternal great-grandfather with the mantra ' dyaur darvl'. 

The Visnu Dh. S (73 17-19) has similar provisions, the mantras 

respectively being 'prthivl darvwaksita ', 'antariksam darvi- 

raksite,' dyaur-darviraksita'. Medhatithi on Manu IE. 194 

says (following Aiv. Sr and others) that if the names of the 

ancestors are not known he should simply say 'O Father, 

Grandfather' &c. If the gotra be not known then he should 

employ the gotra name Kasyapa. 1072

size of the pindas. Marlci ( quoted by Apararkap. 507) provides 
that in psrvana-sraddha the pinda should be of the sisaof 
undried Smalaka fruit, of the sfae of a bilva fruit in Ekoddista, 
in navasraddhas the pinda should be bigger than in any one of 
the preceding when offered every day during thedays of impu- 
rity on death. The Skandapurana says that pindas should bo of 
such a size as would enable a calf two years old to put it easily 
into its mouth. 1073 Angiras (q. bySm. C p. 475 and Hemadri, 
sraddha p. 1429 ) prescribes that the pindas may be of the size 
of Jcapitlhu or bifoa fruit or of the size of a hen's egg or of an 
amalalca or badara fruit. In the Maitr5yanlya-s«tra 1( " 4 it is 
said that the pinda for the paternal grandfather should bo 
bigger than that for the father and should be in the middle (of 
the three pindas), that the pinda for the great-grandfather 
should be the largest of all. The next point is from what 
materials the pindas were to be made. If pindas were offered 
before agnau!«trana they were to be made from the boiled rice 
(oaru) prepared for agnaukarana. If made after agnaularaw, 
the pindas were to be made from the cooked food (remaining 
after agnaukaraDa) mixed with sesamum (vide Yaj" L 242). If 
pindas were to be offered after the brshmanas took their dinner, 
the 'pindas were to be made from the remainder of the food 
cooked for the brshmanas which was to be mixed with the 
boiled rice for agnaukarana as stated in Estysyana's Srtddha- 
autra 1075 The pindas were to be placed according to the 
Matsva" 7 * on darbhas spread on the ground cleaned with water 
mixed with cow's dung and urine. There were others such as 
Devala, the Brahmapurana and Bhavisyapurana that proscnbod

were to be placed and then pindas. The Vayupurana provides 
that a line should be drawn on the altar or the ground with the 
root of a darbha to the accompaniment of the following mantras 
viz. wn ' I destroy whatever is impure ; I have killed all asuras, 
danams, raksasas, yaksas, pisacas (goblins), guhyakas and 
yatudhanas* and the mantra 'struck down (are the asuras 
and raksasas sitting on the Yedi )'. In Ap. Sr. L 10.2, Manu 
HT 317, Visnu Dh. S. 73.17-19, Yama ( q. by Hemadri p. 1440 ), 
the Kalpataru ( on Sr. p. 303 ), Maharnavaprakasa ( q by 
Hemadri ), Hemadri ( Sr. pp. 1440-42 ) and Sr. P pp. 266-267 
referenoe is made to adoration of the six seasons and the 
obeisance ( namaslcara ) to the pitrs in the words ' namo vah 
pitaro ' ( Vaj S IL 32 ) l078 and the repetition of three mantras 
when each of the three piDdas is offered, some holding that the 
seasons were to be deemed as identified with ' rasa ', ' iosa ' and 
four other words ( in Vaj. S H. 32 ), while others held that the 
adoration of the seasons is quite distinct from the namaskaras 
to the pitrs. In the Saunakatharvanasraddha-kalpa, the pindas 
are offered in the reverse order i. e. first to the great-grand- 
father, then to the grandfather and then to the father ( Hemadri 
on sraddha p. 1442 ). 5p. Sr. I. 9. 4 refers to this method in

480 History of DkarmaiSstra [Vol, 

About the final disposal (pratipatti) of the pindas several 
views wore entertained. We have already seen (note 780) 
that the Vaj. S, and several sutras provided that the middle one 
of tho throo pindas for paternal ancestors was to be eaten by 
tho wife of the performer of the sraddha if she was desirous of 
a son. Manu (IH- 263-263) provides that the dliarmapatni 
( i. e, a wife of the same varna and married before any other 
wife ) should eat the middle pinda with the mantra ' adhatta 
pitaro garbham ' ( q. in n, 780 ) and then she gives birth to a 
son who lives long, secures fame, is intelligent and obtains 
wealth and progony and who is of a good and righteous turn of 
mind, Tho same rule is provided for by the Laghu-Asvateyana 
23.83, tho Kvirnia H. 2. 71, 76, Matsya 16.52, Vayu 76.31, 
Visnudharmottara 1. 171 8, 230, 149, Padma (srstikhanda 9.121) 
and other puranas. As regards pindas in general, the 5sv. Sr, 
(II. 7. 14-17 ) says that the other two pindas ( except the middle 
one ) should be oast into water or in fire or they may be eaten 
by a brahmana who has, suddenly developed a distaste for food 
or they may be partaken by one who has been suffering from a 
serious disease (such as tuberculosis or leprosy) and that in 
the latter case the man either recovers- or dies. The Gobhila-gr. 
( IV. 3. 31-34 ) provides that the pindas should be thrown into 
water or in fire or should be given to a brahmana or a cow to 
eat Manu (IH. 260-261) says the same and adds that they 
mav be given to a goat for eating and that some allow them to 
be devoured by birds Y5j. 1 257, Matsya 16.52-53, and Padma"" 
mention the same five ways of disposal but the last adds one 
more viz. placing them near a mound of earth. The Varaha- 
nurana 1W ° ( 190 Wl ) says that the performer may eat the first 
pSda himself, he should give the ^*1* infc «£«- 
third he should oast into water. The AnusSsanaparva (125. 25.26)

place, then an old bull or a goat may eat the middle pinda 
( quoted by Sm. C. on Sr. p. 486, Kalpataru on Sr p 324 ). The 
Visnudharmottara ( 1 141. 8 ) prescribes that when a sraddha is 
performed at a tirtlia, the pindas should be cast into the sacred 
water. The Anusasanaparva 125. 38-40 and some of the 
puranas such as Vayu ( 76 32-34 ) and Brahma ( 220 150-152 ) 
provide that certain consequences follow from the disposal of 
pindas in ore way or another viz. the best worlds by giving 
pindas to cows, intellect and fame from casting into water, 
long life from offering them to birds &c. Vide also Brahmanda 
( upodghata, chap. 12. 31-35) which provides that if given to 
cows the result is best complexion, t if to cocks then delicacy, 
long life if given crows In this connection it should be noted that 
pindas of rice or of flour were not to be offered in all sraddhas. 
The Svaddha-kalpalata, ( pp. 86-89 ) has a long discussion about 
the sraddhas in which the offering of pindas of food is forbidden. 
¥or example, it quotes Pulastya to the effect that in sraddhas 
performed on the two ayana days, on the two equinoctial days, on 
any sanfcranti, no pindas are to be offered, so also in sraddhas 
on EkadasI, Trayodasl, on Magha and Krttika naksatras, if a 
man desires to have sons and wealth. 

On the question as to what is the principal item in the 
sraddha there are three views. Some, like Govindaraja, ,osl 
hold that feeding of brahman as is the principal thing and 
they rely on Manu lit 129 which says ' One may feed even a 
single learned brahmana in a rite for gods_and manes and not 
many who do not know vedic mantras ; by doing so he reaps 
abundant Toward'. Here the reward or fruit is associated 
with feeding a learned brahmana There is a maxim 10S2 of the 
Purvamlmamsa. that ' whatever is mentioned in proximity with 
an action that has a reward or fruit but has no special 
reward of its own, is subsidiary (anga) to what is declared to 
have a reward.' Besides, there is no pindadana in certain 
sraddhas such as amasraddha, sraddha on the Yugadi days. 1083

deep yearning for a son who would offer them pinda^aTSy 
and water on sacred rivers &c (vide note 911). JtoSw 
support is sought for this view in the fact that in the sraddha 
on the bn-th of a son and in sraddha offered even by a good 
Sudra the feeding of brahmanas is forbidden. A third view is 
that both the feeding of brahman as and the offering of pmdas 

a w- ™, mCipal matteis in a §rMdha - The Gobhila-smrti, after 
stating an the other two views and some of the reasons therefor, 
tells us that the author of it is himself in favour of this third 
view. In cases where the word sraddha is employed and there is 
neither brahmana feeding nor pindadana as in Daiva sraddha, 
the word sraddha is applied in a secondary sense (gaum). Vide 
Hemadri (sraddha) pp. 157-160. In the Dharmapradlpa it is 
said that among the followers of the Yajurveda (i e, 
Vajasaneyins) the offering of pindas is principal, among the 
followers of the Bgveda the feeding of brahmanas is principal, 
while among the followers of the Samaveda both are principal. 
In this way sraddha partakes of two characters viz it is a yoga 
(sacrifice) and also Ims a gift (dana) Haradatta, Hemadri, 
Kapardi and others appear to hold that all three (bhqjana 
pindadana and agnaufcaraoa) are principal Vide Samskara- 
ratnainala p. 1003. 

The Matsyapurana says in a famous passage 'ancestors

the hand of the performer of sraddha); the father, (the 
grand-father and great-grandfather) are entitled to the pinda; 
the offerer of the pinda is the 7th; thus sapvnda relationship 
extends to seven generations 1086 . The Markandeya-purana 
states that three ancestors beginning from the paternal grand- 
father of the paternal grandfather enjoy the wipings (of the 
hand of the performer when he offers pindas). 1087 The Brahtna- 
purana(220. 84-86) has similar verses. Mann provided 1088 
that the performer should place three pindas on darbhas and 
then wipe off from Ms hand the particles of food and water 
sticking to it with the roots of the darbhas (on which the pindas 
were placed) and that such wipings aTe meant for those who 
are called 'lepabhagin' (the three paternal ancestors after the 
paternal great-grand-f ather ). Similar provisions are made by

(5.carakat)da21824), KurmalL 22.52. Medhatithi on Manu 
III. 216 says that even if no food or water sticks to the hand 
still the performer rubs the hand against the roots of the dar- 
bhas on which the, first pinda was placed. A special rule was. 
provided by Devala quoted in Sraddhakalpalata (p. 14) that 
if the father or mother became a mleccha (by forcible or volun- 
tary conversion &c.) one should not observe any impurity 
for him or her and no sraddha should be offered and when 
offering the three pindas in place of the father the name of 
Visnu should be uttered. 

One question that exercised the minds of well-known 
writers was whether the daily Vat&vadeva should be performed 
before starting the sraddha ceremonies or after the latter were 
finished. "We have to remember fiTst that several works state 
that rites for pitas deserve pre-eminence over those for the "

gods 1085 . Mariu (IIL 265) states im that after the brahmanas 
have been dismissed the performer of sraddha shall offer the 
(daily) domestic bali offering and that this is the settled 
rule of dharma. Medhatithi explains that the word 'bali' is 
merely illustrative. The Matsyapurana 1W1 17 61, the Varaha- 
purana (14.43), Skanda VH. 1. 366. 101-102, Devala, Karsnajhn 
and others provide that after the rites for the fathers are 
finished Vaisvadeva should be performed. When Vaisvadeva 
is parformed after the completion of sraddha rites, it is to be 
offered from the food that remains after being utilized for 
the sraddha dinner. But Hemadri (pp. 1058-1065) holds a long 
discussion and arrives at the following conclusions In the 
case of an ahttagm (p. 1064), Vaisvadeva is to be performed 
before sraddha except in the case of the sraddha on the 11th day 
after death. In the case of one who has not kept the sacred 
fires there are three optional times for Vaisvadeva, viz. after 
agnaulcaram or after the viMra (scattering of food on darbhas for 
those dying without the samsJcaras being performed for them), 
or after the brShmanas are dismissed on the completion of the 
sraddha (p 1064). If Vaisvadeva is to be performed before 
sraddha or in the midst of it, then the cooking of food must be 
done separately for Vaisvadeva and for sraddha. to the case of 
all, whether sagnilca or amgnt^ Vaisvadeva must ^performed 
with the remainder of the food left after use m sraddha, if the 
former is performed after the latter. There were sages hke 
pShTnasA that held that Vaisvadeva should not be performed

for the former. The Nirnayasindhu (UL p. 459) states that as 
most Bmrtis place the performance of Vaisvadeva after sraddha 
and as many writers of commentaries and digests such as 
Medhatithi and Smrtiratnavali do the same all should perform 
Vaisvadeva after finishing sraddha. 

It is now necessary to illustrate how parvana sraddha is 
performed in modern times. Here the greatest variety prevails. 
The details of the rite vary in the different parts of India. They 
vary also according as the performer helongs to a particular 
Veda or a particular recension of the Veda, they vary 
according to the particular eminent writer that is followed 
and further additions ate made according as the performer is 
a Vaisnava or a Saiva. Such differences have to be passed over 
here, particularly because they are not material. We saw 
above that the Parvana-Sraddha was very simple in the days 
of the Brahmanas and most of the sutias. There was then no 
express mention of the worship of Visvedevah in Parvana- 
sraddha, or of the maternal ancestors or of the wives of any 
ancestors. Gradually these came to he added and by the time 
of the Yajnavalkyasmrti there was special invocation of the 
Visvedevah But these latter were probably not expressly 
divided into groups at the time of that work. During the smrfci 
period groups of Visvedevah came to be assigned to different 
kinds of sraddbas(videp 457 note 1018). The Puran as pres- 
cribed several PauTanic mantras for being recited during the 
Sraddha rite, such as the verse * agacchantu ' (note 984) and the 
verse 'devatsbhyah pitrbhyasca" (p. 458 note 1020). Then there 
arose the principle of the Pm-vamlmamsa that all rites described 
in the different s&khas and sutras constitute but oae rite and 
that one may take over from another sakha or sutra details 
descnbed therein which are not opposed to one's own sakha or 
to li^™ 4 , 5 l- 55notes 10H-1013). This principle tended 
tf th * Srad t dha rltes a " *"*«*"» and the whole procedure 
became swollen to an enormous extent. How even the slightest 
variation causes difference in the details maybe illustrated by 
ST*' ^ Mi hila villages even among poor men eleven 
brahmanas are invited for parvana-sraddha, but it is often 
difficult to secure a very learned man {who is called Z^

Vajasaneyins may be stated here. Though the Sraddhasfitra of 
KatySyana, which is of special authority among Vajasansyins, 
declares (at the end of kandika III) that the brahmanas are 
to be dismissed at the end of the sraddha with the verse 'vsjq 
vaje' (Vgj. S 9.18) and the performer should circumambulate 
the brahmanas with the mantra 'a ma vajasya" (Va] S. 9. 19), 
it is not the practice among the sistas in Mifchila according to 
the editor of the Sraddharatna to observe these directions in 
what is called ' apatraka-parvana-sraddha * in these days. In 
Kudradhara's Sraddhaviveka (pp. 138-146) the 'apatraka- 
parvana-sraddha-prayoga* is set out at length. 

In medieval and modern times in the different provinces 
of India different manuals are followed by the followers of the 
several Vedas. For example, in Bengal the Samavedms, 
Yajurvedms and Bgvedins follow the procedure of parvaea- 
sraddha laid down in the manuals (or paddhatts) of Bhavadeva, 
Pasupati and Kalesi respectively and there are many persons 
who follow the rules laid down by Raghunandana in his 
Sraddhataistva and Yanirvedisraddha-tattva. In Mithila, 
6rldatta wrote his Pitrbhakti for Yajurvedins and the Sraddha- 
kalna for Samavedins and the Sraddha-ratna of MahSmaho- 
padhyayaLaksmlpati (between 1500 to 1640 A. D ) which is 
pnntedatDarbhangaand claims to be the traditional manual 
for Maithilas ( Maithila^ampradayika-sraddhapaddhafci ) in 
several places says that it follows the Sugatisopana of Prati- 
hastaka for Ohandogas and also for Vajasaneyms. In the

added in the text and note3 it will be clear that this modern 

rite is all inclusive i. e. it follows tbe JLsv. Sr. often taking 

passages verbatim from it, the smrtis and puranas). The 

performer wears white garments (lower and upper ) and sits 

on a seat of kuias or of wool or deer skin and then sips water 

twice and wears a pavitia on the finger next to the small finger 

with Rg. IX. 83 1. He ties his top knot on the head and sacred 

thread with kusas, and ties three kusa blades with tilas on the 

leffof the dhoti worn by him. Then he performs pranayarna and 

declares the resolve {sanhalpa) Wi to perform (the S&mvatsanka) 

sraddba after referring to the time and place and together 

with agnaukarana, pindadana &c The invited brahmanas 

reply 'do so'. Then the performer puts into a copper vessel water 

with the mantra * imam me Gange * (Rg X 75. 5), sandalwood 

paste with the mantra 'Gandhadvaram,' yava grains with the 

mantra ' thou art yava, king of cereals, "Varuna is thy patron, 

thou art endowed with sweetness, thou art the remover of 

all sins and art known by all sages as holy', betelnut (with 

B,g X. 97,15 ), gold ( or some coin ) with the mantra ' Hiranya-

Bg. Vlir. 95. 7-9. Then after repeating the well-known verse 
' apavitrah pavitro va ' wn (whoever, whether pure or impure or 
being in any state whatever, remembers the name of Visnu 
* becomes pure externally as well as internally ), he requests 
'May everything such as the place and the materials be 
rendered pure '. The brahmanas reply " let it be so.' Then 
placing some coin on the ground, the performer having in 
his hand sesamum grains, water and kfisas goss round 
(pradaksina) the brahmanas thrice, and repeats three verses 
( in classical Sanskrit ) in praise of the dust of the feet of 
brahmanas and a Vedia passage from Tai A. H, 15 Iw8 ' All the 
devatas reside in a brahmana who knows the Veda; therefore 
every day one should perform obeisance to brahmanas knowing 
the Veda, He should not utter anything derogatory or evil 
(either true or false) about them. (By doing so) he pleases 
all these devatas.' After making obeisance (to the brahmanas) 
twice he Bhould be pracmsvltl, repeat the verse 'akrodhanaih' 
(note 913 p. 407 above) aDd request the brahmanas 'may you be 
pleased to say that I have complete adh/Jcara to perform the

should reply 'let there be this adhikara for the performance of

you declare that this time is the proper time and that the food 
cooked is fit for being offered' The brahmanas reply let it 
be so * Then he asks the permission to give invitation to me 
brahmanas. They give it. Then he touches the right knee

Bhould touch the left knee of the brahmana {pitrya) and say 
to him "you should accept the invitation to represent my father,

request- 'you should repair to my house.' The brahmana replies 
'I shall do so ' Then he should make mandalas 10 " for the daiva 
and pitrya brahmanas. Then savyam. The performer should 
offer seat, sandalwood paste, flowers and say 'may all the items 
(upacaras) of showing honour be complete by means of yava 
grains.' Then apasavyam". He offers asana (seat), sandalwood 
paste and flowers and declares 'may all the upacaras be completed 
by means of sesamum grains.' ' Then savyam. He offers welcome 
to the daiva brahmanas, to which they respond by saying 
'_susvagatam' (it is a good welcome). Then he should say 
« here is pMya for you, O Visve devas called Pururava and 
Ardraval Bhur-bhuvah-svah to the (daiva) brahmana'; the 
response is ' supadyam '. He should wash the feet of ( the 
daiva ) brahmana 'or brahmanas with the mantra ' san no devlr ' 
(RgX.9.4, vide n. 968). Then he wears the thread in the 
apasaoya way and offers welcome to the pitrya brahmana or 
brahmanas representing the three male ancestors ,,0 ° and offers 
to give padya to them and they respond with the words

* Sam no devlr ' ( Bg. X 9, 4 ) is repeated and also the words 

* thou art yava, separate horn us those who hate ns and who are 
our enemies'. Then apasavyam. The following texts are repeated 
viz. Bg. X 9.4, ftg. X, 15.1 and with the mantra ' The asurss, 
rsksasas, the pisaoas, that dwell along the earth are, struck 
down; may they go from this place elsewhere wherever their 
mind may be fixed ', he scatters sesamum grains everywhere and 
repeats the mantra, Rg. X 87.1 There are eight Vasus, eleven 
Rudras and twelve 3dityas. Let there be protection given by 
Visnu at the door where srsddha is being performed and may 
this spot be GayS. The brahmanas reply 'Let it be a good spot.' 
Then eawjam. He sprinkles drops of water with darbhas over 
the food that is cooked for the srsddha dinner with the mantras 
viz. Rg. IX 58, 1, IX 67. 26-38 and with the three Vyahrtis ana 
the Gayatri. Then he requests 'May there be purity of the 
cooking' and 'may the sprinkling of the cooked food be accord-

into them water and invokes the water once with the mantra,

the two arghya vessels for daiva brahmanas with the mantra 
' Yavosi dhanyaraja va ' ( note 985 ) and also sandalwood paste, 
flowers, basil leaf and performs obeisance. He says ' May all 
the up'acaras be completed by means, of yavas; the two arghya 
vessels for daiva brahmanas are fully ready '. The response is 

* susampanne '. He says 'svaha, these are arghya waters'. The 
response is ' let there be arghya waters '. Placing his left 
■hand in which he holds kusas and yava grains on the right 
knee of the daiva brahmana and holding in his (right) hand yava 
grains he says ' I shall invoke the Visve devas called Pururava 
and Axdrava to -be present va. you' They respond ' do invoke '. 
He invokes the Yisve-devas with the mantra ' visve devasa ' 
( Rg H. 47. 13 ) separately repeated as regards each daiva 
brahmana. He says, '1 invoke the Visve devas with the mantra 

.* visve devah smntemam ' ( Rg. "VX 52. 13 ). Having invoked 
Visve devas he casts the remaining yava grains on the ground 
-near the feet of the daiva brahmanas. Then he gives water to 
-them -(daiva brahmanas) and he puts in their hands the darbhaa 
i placed over Mhejaghya vessels; he says ' OYisve devas called 
-Pururava and Aidrava 1 this is atghya water for yon; svaha, 
adoration'. They respond * let there be arghya '. Repeating the 
mantra 'ySdivya apah 1 (vide Asv. Gr. IV. 7. 13 above in n.

They respond "let it be so offered'. The same process is .followed 
as to the second daiva brahmana. Then ho offers fragrant" 02

or cash therefor he recites * yuvS suvSsSh ' (Bg. EL 8.4). Then 
he says ' these items viz. gandha, leaves, flowerB, incense, lamp 
ending with covering (garment) be all of them complete. 
Let there he good worship in the rite of worship; May that 
which is wanting or is excessive be according to prescribed 
rules'. The brShmanas respond *astu vidhivat' and the per- 
former recites the verse 'I do obeisance to Aoyuta by remem- 
bering whom or by uttering whose name whatever is wanting 
in tapas (observances) or sacrifices becomes at once perfect". 

Then he says to the pitrya brahmanas 'with your permis- 
sion I shall offer worship to the pitrs'. They reply 'do offer.' 
Then apasavyam. After bending his right knee, the performer 
says'Bhurbhuvah svah to Brahman, this is the seat for my 
father, grandfather and great-grandfather, named H. N., whose 
gotra is so and so and who are identical with Vasu, Rudra 
and Aditya'. So saying he offers double-folded darbhas with 
sesamnm grains to the pitrya brahmanas who reply 'svasanam'. 
Then follows the same procedure as regards pitrya brahmanas 
which has been already set out as to daiva brahmanas. The 
only difference is that instead of two darbhas three darbhas

He places the vessel containing saihsravas with the top upside 
down on darbhas to the north of the daiva vessel, with the 
mantra 'thou axt a place for the pitrs.' Then gandha, flowers 
with tulasi and bhrngaraja leaves, incense, lamp, garment or 
cash therefor, goplcandana, sacred chord, betelnut, kuSas for 
pavitra are offered to .the pitrs and he repeats the verse 'idam 
pitrbhyah' (Hg. X. 15. 2). After repeating the verse 'yat 
smrtya' (vide above ) there is ' savyam'. The performer says 
' with your permission I shall prepare mandalas and place the 
plates'. The response is ' do so \ On the spot where the plates 
for daiva brahmanas are to be placed a four-cornered mandala 
beginning from the south-west to north-east and made with the 
right hand towards it and on the spot for the plates for pitrya 
brahmanas the mandala is circular beginning from north-east 
to south-west made with the left hand towards it. Then the 
plates for the diners are to be placed inside those mandalas. 
Then taking holy ashes (apasavyam) he draws a line round the 
plates for pitrya brahmanas with the mantra 'pisanga-bhristim' 
(Rg. I. 133. 5). Then samjam. Then round the plates of 
the daiva brahmanas he draws lines with the mantras *raksa no* 
(Bg. IV". 3. 14) and 'brahma ca' ($g. X. 4. 7) and two - 
more verses ( probably Pauranic ) which pray that" the mark 
made with ashes may guard all, just as Visnu protects the 
worlds. Just as Visnu renders ineffective the eyes of all men

regaled themselves and came like bulls, each to his share * and 
having smelt the remains of the boiled rice from which pindas 
are made from the left side ( to the right ) he should cast the 
piDdas ( on the darbhas ) and should partake of the boiled rice 
by taking in as much steam and flavour out of it as he can by 
smelling it. He should say ' my father 1 1ST. N". by name, so and 
so by gotra, apply unctuous substance' ; with these words he 
should anoint the pindas by means of darbhas with ghee or 
sesamum oil. And he should apply collyrhim to the pindas with 
the words ' O father 1 N. N. by name and so and so by gotra 
apply collyrium '. He should put on the pindas unctuous subst- 
ance, collyxium and garment, 1118 the last being the fringe of 
a garment or a tuft of wool with the words * O fathers ! this is 
the garment for you, do not take up any other ( garment ) than 
this '. Then savyam. He then says ' I shall offer worship to 
the pindas for the prosperity of my family *. He then offers 
to the pitas present in the pindas padya, arghya, water 
for acamana, bath, gandha, flowers, bhrngaraja leaf, incense, 
lamp and iimvedya. of apupa ( cakes ) and payasa (rice cooked in 
milk), tambiila and daksina, using the word 'svadha' after each

'Fathers ' obeisance to you for the sake of food, for strength, 
for susma, for the non-terrible (pghora), for jiva, for rasa; svadha 
to you, O pitrs, obeisance to you; these are yours, O pitrs!

Then savyam. On the ground near the plates of the Vaisva- 
deva brahmanas he scatters food together with yavas and 
water with the verse 'I shall offer food scattered (t)ifa>a)noar 
the Vaisvadeva brahmanas to those gods to whom no soma 
drink is offered and who are bereft of a share in sacrifices; this 
scattered food is offered to Visvedevas who do not partake of 
the soma drink; it is not (now) mine'. Then apasaryam He 
saya 'I shall offer food scattered near pihya brahmanas on the 
ground oovered with darbhas to those who died without Hie 
samshaias being performed for them and to those women of my 
family who left the family (for bad deeds); this scattered food

it is not mine*. So saying he strews food with water and 
sesamum seeds and then says after reciting Rg. X. 15.14 'this 
pinda made from the remainder of the food and oocupying the 
position that a piDda given at Gays occupies, has been offered

requests 'May you say that the water and food and the like offer- 
ed m the Pratisamvatsarikasraddha to pitr, pitamaha and pra- 
pitSmaha, so and so by name and gotra, be inexhaustible.' The 
pitrya brahmanas reply" 'so be it.* Then savyanu ^ The same 
request is made to the daiva brahmanas and the reply is the same. 
Then gold is given to the daiva brahmanas and silver to pitrya 
brahmanas and the performer says 'may the daksinas (fees) 
given to the brahmanas that ate the sraddha dinner protect (me).' 
They reply 'may they do so'.' 1 Then he says 'I shall request you 
to utter the word svadha 1 ' They reply 'do so.' Then apasavyam. 
Then he says 'May (the brahmanas representing) father, grand- 
father and great-grandfather utter the word svadha.' They - 
reply 'let there be svadha.' Then he should place over the 
pindas sesamum grains and water. Then he says 'May you 
declare that svadha be accomplished." They reply * may 
svadha be accomplished.' Then savyam. Then he says 'may 
you say that the gods led by Agni be pleased.' They reply 
'may the Visvedevah be pleased* Then apasavyam. Then he 
requests 'May you declare that the pitrs led by the Vasus

says 'May you declare that there is accomplishment of the 
sankalpa ' ( made at the beginning of the rite ). They reply 
' May there be accomplishment x>f the sankalpa '. He asks 
' were the vegetables and cooked food liked by the pitrs'. They 
reply ' they were most excellent '. Then the pBrfonner deck's 
himself by applying sandal paste to his forehead. After doing 
obeisance to the pindas he requests for blessings for his family 
( which are the same as those set out above from the Fadma- 
purSna on p 452 above) and one more blessing 'May persons beg 
of us but may we not beg of any one ' ( vide n. 998 ). The 
brahmanas reply in the same words only employing the words 
' you ' or ' your ' for ' us ' or ' our '. : 

He says ' I shall remove the pindas '. They reply * do 
remove '. Then he repeats the verses * Tad Visnoh ' ( Bg. I. 
22.20 ), ' Tad vipraso * ( $g. I 23.21 ) and two more verses and 
then a Pauranic verse enumerating the seven holy cities of 
Ayodhya, Mathura, Maya, Kasi, Kafici, Avantika and Dvaraka. 
He says 'May there be peace, prosperity and contentment 
on the spot where the pindas are'. They reply 'these

Then he lays aside the Jmrca. He then recites the verse 
1 V&je vaje ' ( ftg. VH, 38. 8 ). Then savyam. Then he says 
'0 pitrs, get up together with the devas' and repeats the 
verses ' a ma vajasya ' ( Vaj. S. 9. 19 ), ' svSdusamsadah * ( Bg, 
VI. 75 9), ' brahmauasah- pitarah ' ($g. VI 75.10), 'ihaiva

fathers being pleased grant to men ( their descendants ) long 
life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, moksa, happiness and 
kingdom' (Yaj. I. 370, but reads ' Jjayaochantu ' for 'prayae- 
chanti ' ). Then he prays ' May these blessings turn out to be 
true, may my family prosper, may this Pratisainvatsarika- 
sraddha have the same fruits as that of a sraddha performed at 
Gaya I May the pitrs secure inexhaustible gratification.' Then he 
proceeds ' Today my birth has had its reward by bowing to your 
feet &c.' (vide n. 999 for the two verses repeated here ). The 
brahmanas reply * we forget the trouble and excuse you.' Then 
he says' Today this tithi is like a day sacred to the sun, the 
brahmanas invited are like Vyasa, Vasistha and Vamadeva: 
may you declare that whatever is lacking as regards seats,

one should repeat each verse with ahava separately uttered. 
The performer should follow the brahmanas up to the 
boundary (of the village ). He says ' whatever blemish there 
may be in japa, tapas or sr&ddha rite — may all that become 
free from blemish by the favour of brahmanas. I do adora- 
tion to that Acyuta (Visnu) by remembering whom &c. 
O best of brahmauas 1 may this sraddha, even if devoid of 
mantras, or of some rite or of 'faith, become perfect by your

father be pleased by this sacrifice, viz. the pratisamvatsarika- 
sraddha of the pitrs This is a sacrifice to the manes. Tat sat. 
May it be dedicated to Brahma. ' Then he repeats the verse 
'Vasat te' (Bg. VII. 99 7) and then says 'adoration to Visnu 
(Visnavenamah) thrice and sips water twice. The fruit of 
offering pin&as is stated by Brhaspati and Vrddha-Farasara as

practised in Madras in these days only a few points of diffe- 
rences in detail emerge. In tlie Madras procedure the numer- 
ous mantras as set out above (p. 448) do not occur nor doss 
the Tai. A. passage occur therein, hut the verses in praise of 
the dust of brShmana's feet do occur. Most of the mantras 
both Vedic and Fauranic ate the same. The blessings (aslr- 
vadas) in the Madras manual are more elaborate and include 
even the performer's cattle in the blessing of health and long 
life. In the Madras manual several mantras are set ontas 
'annasQkta' mantras in the procedure itself. The Madras 
paddhati adds at the end the well known verse 'kayena vacs 
manasendriyairva '. 

The procedure for Yajurvedins of the Madhyandina Sakha 
in Bengal as set out by Eaghunandana in his Yajurvedi-sra- 
ddhatattva is entirely based on the 2nd and 3rd kandikas of the 
Sraddha-sutra of Katyayana. The Farvanasraddlia-prayoga in 
Halayudha's Brahmanasarvasva closely follows Katyayana and 
I am assured by a careful student of DharmasSstra that the pro- 
cedure of parvanasraddha followed by Msdhyandinas at Bkat- 
para in Western Bengal is in strict conformity with the proce- 
dure laid down by Eaghunandana. The Sraddhasfitra of 
Katyayana is translated here with some explanations and 
additions made by Halayudha and Eaghunandana and the

IV] ' The Siaddlmsvtia of Katyayana 505 

"The parvana-sraddha is preceded by the rite for Visve- 
devas. The procedure follows that of Findapitryajfia im ". In 
the rites for the pitrs double-folded darbhas are to be used (while 
in Vaisvadevika rite straight darbbas are used ). Whenever 
any thing is to be gifted, the performer (in all daiva as well as 
pitrya rites ) wears apavitra and makes the gift sitting. ( When 
questions are to be asked) the performer puts the question to 
the most eminent in the row of diners (to the best daiva 
brahmana in daiva rites and to the best pitrya brahmana in 
pitrya rites ) or he may put the question to all ( and the reply 
is given by one or by all) Spreading darbhas on the seats 
(he makes the brahmanas occupy them), he puts the question 
'shall I invoke the Visvedevas (to the daiva brahmana) '. Being 
permitted ( by the daiva brahmanas) in the words 'do invoke', he 
invokes the Visvedevas with the mantra 1125 'Vis've devasa 
Sgata' (Vaj. S. 7. 34 'Ye All Gods, come, listen to this my call 
and sit down on this darbha grass '). Then he scatters yavas 
(in front of the brahmanas), mutters a mantra 'Visvedevah 
sruoutemam' (Vaj. S. 33. 53, "Ye All Gods, hear this call of 
mine'). After this japa he asks (the pitrya brahmanas) 'I 
shall invoke the pitrs '. When permitted (by the pitrya brah- 
manas) in the words 'do invoke', he invokes them with the" 
mantra 'usantas tva' (Vaj. S. 19. 70, 'OAgni! we longing for 
our fathers place you down' &c. ). Then he scatters (sesamum

he touches with his hands (above and below each plate) and 
repeats the mantra 'The earth is thy vessel fee. (notes 992, 
1108a) (He keeps some food aside for making pindas later on;. 
Then (having served the food in the plates) he plunges the 
thumb of the brahmanas in the food with a rk (Bg. I »*. 17, 
'idam Vianur vioakrame') addressed to Visnu or with a Yams 
so addressed ('Visnokavyamidam raksasva'). Then he scat-

much liked (by diners or by the departed) or he may serve 
such food as he can afford. "While the brahmanas are engaged 
in eating (the dinner) he should perform japa of the follow- 
ing " 31 , viz. the saoTed Gayatrl once or thrice preceded by om 
and the vyahitis, the verses called RaksoghnI (note 1111),

Apratiratha hymn ( Rg. X 103. 1-13 ) beginning with ' asuh

maDas are satiated with food, he should scatter some food in 
front of the dining brahmanas, he should give to each brah- 
mana water once (for apoianu at the end of dinner). Then he 
should mutter as before the Gayatrl, the (three) Madhumati 
verses (Bg. I 90 6-8) and the word 'madhu' (thrice). Then he 
asks ' are you satiated '. Being permitted by them in the words 
'we are satiated*, he makes them give their consent as to the 
rest of the food, collects together all food in one vessel ( in 
order to make pindas from it); he offers (two sets of three 
pindas, three for paternal ancestors and three for maternal

the dinner. After they perform Scamana he gives to the brah- 
manas water, flowers, aksatas and aKsayyodalui vm . Then he 
prays for the following blessings. He prays 'may the pita be 
not terrible (i. e. be kind) to us '. The brahmanas reply 'may 
they be so'. He prays 1 May our family prosper'. They reply 
'may it be so'. He prays 'May donors increase in our family'. 
They reply 'let it be so'. He prays 'May Vedas and our pro- 
geny prosper*. The reply is ' May they do so *. He says ' May 
faith not depart from me ' ; they say ' May it not depart'. He 
says 'May we possess many things that we can donate'. They 
reply 'sobs it'. After receiving these blessings he spreads 
fcaatas called svadhavacaniya %m " together with pavitras (on 
the ground near the piDdas or, on the pindas themselves 
according to Devayajfiika and others); he asks (all the brah- 
manas or the most eminent one ) 'shall I request you to utter 
the word svadha '. Being permitted by them in the words 'May 
svadha be recited ' he prays * May there be svadha to the pita, 
to the grandfathers, to the great-grand-fathers, to the maternal 
grandfather, maternal great-grandfather and maternal great- 
great-grandfather'. When the brahmanas reply 'May thereto 
svadha' he sprinkles water over the svadhavacanlya darhhas

IV ] Parvamahaddha m Bengal 509 

It is to be noted that in the Bengal Manual of Parvana- 
£raddha based on the Brahmanasarvasva of Halayudha and also 
on Raghunandana'sYaiurvedi-sraddhatattvathe following details 
are added after the pindas are placed on the darbhas and before 
the dismissal of the brahmanas. He turns towards the north and 
says 'O pitrs, regale yourselves here and come like bulls each to 
his portion.' Then he turns round to his former position and says 
'the pitrs regaled themselves and came like hulls each to his 
own share.' Then he loosens 113S the side of his dhott which has 
e been tucked up and- then fold3 up his hands (i.e. offers six 
natnaskaras) with the mantra 1,3S 'Namo vah pitaro rasaya' 
(Vaj. S. H. 32). He smells «* the pindas and gives the middle 
one to his wiFe, if she desires a son, with the mantra 'adhatta' 
(Vaj. 8 H 33). . 

From considerations of space the procedure of pSrvana 
sraddha among Hiranyakesins in modern times is passed over 
here. Moreover, it closely resembles the procedure in Asv. Gr. 
set out above, the principal difference being that some of the 
mantras are different. The "Samskararatnamala of Goplnstha 
deals with this from p. 985 onwards But one noticeable feature 
of this last work is that of making hair-splitting distinctions 
On p. 985 it refers to two sraddhas (other than pinda-pitr- 
yajna) to be performed on amavasya, viz. rnSsi-sraddha and 
masite-irGddha, the first being described by the Dharmasfitra of 
Hiranyakesin and the second by the Grhyasfltra. Goplnstha. 
further says that masikasraddha is the model of the other 
sraddhas described in the Grhyasutra and masisraddha is the 
model of sraddhas described in the Dharmasastras, such as 
Maiaiayasraddha or Samvatsarika-sraddha, that Darsasraddba 
itself » masi-sraddha (p. 988) and that masikaHSrSddha may be 
performed on each <tofe or on any one darsa day in a year and 
that masi -sraddha fol lows immediately after PindapitryajSa as

laid down by Manu (HI 122) and masikafcaddha may be per: 
formed after mfisi-sraddha. Inmodern times no one p «fcEi 
masisrsddha or masika-sraddha strictly in accordance with the 
ancient rules. Sraddha is supposed to be performed by feeding 
a brahmana and giving Mm a daksina of a few amms. The 
Sraddhatattva (Jiv., part 1 p. S54) provides, after quoting 
Matsya and Bhavisya, that, if a person is unable to perform a 
parvanasrsddha every month, he should perform one at least 
thrice a year when the sun is in the zodiacal signs of Kanys, 
Kumbha and Vrsahha and that if he is unable to perform even* 
thrice then he should perform at least once when the sun ia in 
the sign of Kahya. 

The two meanings of sapinda given by the Mit. and the 
Dayabhaga have already been explained at yeat length in H. 
of Dh. vol. H, pp. 452-458 and pp. 472-477. The Dayabhaga pro- 
pounded the theory that whoever conferred greater spiritual 
benefit on the deceased by the performance of sraddhas and the 
offering of pindas was entitled to be preferred as an heir to the 
deceased's wealth. The Mit. said that heirship depended on 
blood relationship and the nearest in blood to the deoeased was 
the preferential heir. But even under the Mit. whoever took 
the wealth of the deceased was bound to pay his debts (Ysj. 
IL 51 ) and to offer sraddha and pisda to him. This subject 
and the several propositions deduced from the texts have been 
dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. lit pp. 734-745. 

One thing to be remembered is that in determining the 
preferential right regard is to be had to the capacity of a per- 
son and the efficacy of the pindas when offered. After a 
person takes the wealth of the deceased, there is no legal 
machinery to enforce his duty to offer pindas "». It was 
argued in Nalinalcsha v. Rajam Kanto 350. W. N. 726 that, if on 
heir does not offer pindas or refuses to offer them to his ancestor, 
he was not entitled under Hindu Law to succeed to him. This 
argument was repelled by the judges with the remark that there 
was no authority for such a proposition and that the right to 
inheritance is based under the Dayabhaga not on offering pmda 
lut on the capacity to offer it (p. 739). Vide Gooroo Gdbmda

heritance propounded in the Dayabhaga. But in certain later 
oases such as Aksluwachandra v. Hart Das 35 Cal. 721 it was 
rightly pointed out that spiritual benefit is not always the 
guiding principle under the Bengal school of law, that the 
principle of spiritual efficacy as the guiding principle fails 
in all classes of female relations such as the wife, the daughter 
and the mother whose rights are really based on special texts 
and that the reason for inheritance by a re-united coparcener 
was not spiritual benefit but was based on a quasi contract and 
affection. 

The question about how sraddha was to be performed if one 
or more of the three paternal ancestors were alive engaged the 
thoughts of writers from very ancient times. The 5iv. 1139 Sr. 
S (TL 6. 16-23) first sets out the views of Ganagari, Taulvali 
and Gautama and then refutes them. Ga nagari held that out 
of the three paternal ancestors pindas should be offered to those 
that were dead and those that were alive should be honoured 
in person, since the sraddha rite is meant for pleasing the 
ancestors; Taulvali opined that pindas should be offered to all 
the three ancestors, whether living or dead, since in the rite 
of sraddha they are only a secondary matter (a detail). Gautama 
thought that pindas should be offered to dead ancestors, upto 
three from the father if the latter was living, from the grand- 
father if he was alive and from the great-grandfather if all 
the three be living. Xsv. replies; one cannot offer pindas to 
three ancestors 1U0 beyond the father, grand-father or great- 
grandfather, since one has no adhikSra to do so ; one cannot 
offer pindas to an ancestor after whom there is an ancestor 
(within three degrees) living. One may offer homa into fire 
to those that are alive. (If all three ancestors are alive) 
all the three pindas must be cast into fire or he may not 
begin the rite at all. The ELatyayana sr. M * 1 sutra provides

1140 One can offer pindas only to three ancestors beginning with the 
father according to Vedic passages quoted in notes 958. 960a above and 
Mann IX 188. So there is no ancient authority to offer pinda to 4th or 5th 
or 6th ascendant.

that pindas are offered only to deceased ancestors; therefore 
if a person's father be alive or if there is a deceased ancestor 
between whom and the performer there is an ancestor that is 
alive, then one whose father is alive can only perform flows 
( into fire, but no pindadana ) or he should not undertake at all 
(Bio rite of pinda-pitryajfia or parvanasrSddha); that JitBkarnya 
prescribes that no pindadana is possible when a living ancestor 
(father) intervenes between the performer and a deceased 
ancestor, since a sruti text says 'one does not offer pindas to 
ancestors that are beyond a living ancestor,' Manu (HI. 
230-222 ) deals with this question as follows : If the performer's 
father be alive he should offer pindas to three ancestors begin- 
ning from the paternal grand-father or he may request the 
father to dinner as he would do to a stranger brSfcmana and 
offer pindas to the deceased grand-father and great-grand-father. 
If the father be dead and the grandfather be alive, he may offer a 
pinda only to the father and the great-grandfather (i. e only two 
pindas) or the grand-father who is alive maybe invited to dinner 
as if he were the stranger brahmana invited to represent a 
deceased grand-father or if permitted by the grandfather who is 
alive he may offer pindas to father, great-grandfather and great- 
great-grandfather. The Yismidharmasatra (chap. 75) has several 
rules of a similar character. Some of the Paranas such as 
Skanda VI 225.34-25, Agni 117.58-59 deal with this matter. 
Gobhilasmrti (It 93 ff ) has a long passage on this question, one 
verse of which is quoted below. »« Many of the commentaries 
and digests hold divergent news on this object, vis. the M t.

that one view is that a man whose father is alive cannot engage 
in a parvanasraddha and that the real conclusion is that 
sraddha may be offered to those to whom the father ( of the 
performer ) who is living offers pindas. It is clear that one 
whose father is living should have nothing to do with pindadana 
for deceased ancestors. Manu ( in latter half of in. 220 ) 
allowed an alternative viz. one should feed one's father at a 
dinner (and honour him with the details of worship such 
as gandha, dhUpa, dipa) and offer pindas to the deceased 
grandfather and great-grandfather. When any one or two out 
of the three paternal ancestors are alive and sraddha is permitted 
to a descendant several alternatives become possible by permu- 
tation and combination, which are passed over here from 
considerations of space and utility. But the various views held 
by different writers as described above show clearly what a firm 
grip the theory of the supreme benefits to he derived from 
sraddhas had on the minds not only of commoli people but of 
learned men, who, in spite of the fact that the father was alive 
and was there to offer pindas to his three ancestors, allowed 
even the son ( whose father was living ) to offer pindas to the 
same three ancestors. The Visnu Dh. S. extends the procedure 
about ' jlvatpitrka * to one's mother's paternal ancestors 
(changing the mantra where necessary). 11 * 2 " Similar rules : 
apply where the performer's mother is alive (Agnipurana 
117.60 'evam matradikasyapi tatha matamahadike ' ). 

It is provided by Gobhilasmrti (Id 157 ) that a sruti injunc- 
tion should be made effective by means of anukalpa ( of some 
substituted procedure) if the primary procedure cannot be 
carried out. 1143 If a'pSTSon cannot secure several brahmanas but 
can secure only one, he should perform Parvana-sraddha in 
which six pindas are to be offered with a single brahmana, pro- 
vided he is pan!di^pavam mi (sanctifier of a row of diners) and 
in such a case, nanedya should be offered in place of the dinner

to the daiva brahmanas and the food should be thrown into fire- 
so says Sankha 14.10. If even a single brahmana cannot be had 
foraparvanasraddha, then one should prepare with kusas the 
effigy of brahmana students (batu) and -the performer should 
himself ask the questions and give the answers required in 
psrvan asraddha. 114S 

When one cannot secure a brahmana nor materials, or 
when one is on a journey, or on the birth of a son, or when one's 
wife is m her monthly illness, one may perform amasraddha 
(sraddha with uncooked grains ),"« This is stated by the 
Skandapurana VH 1.206.53. Katyayana and Saurapurana 
19.32 have similar verses ' a twice-born person should perform 

. amasraddha when he is on a journey or is in distress, or if he 
has no fire for cooking and those who are weak may always 
perform it.' The MadanapSrijata (p. 483) states that one who 
has the adhikSra for pSrvanasrSddha can alone offer amasraddha, 
Harita says that when there is an obstacle in performing a 
sraddha, amasraddha is prescribed except in the case of mgaifca 
and samvatsarika srsddhas. iw Amasraddha is always pres- 
cribed for sudras. It was further provided that the grains offered 
in sraddha should be utilized by the brshmanas for eating the 

4 cooked food for themselves and were to be applied for no other 
purpose (Hemadri, Si. p. 1527). Yyasa provides 1148 that the 
quantity of grains should be at least two or three or four times 
as much as the grains regurred for offering cooked food. Some

CHAPTER 'X 

EKODDISTA AND OTHER 8RIDDHAS 

Having dealt at great length with Farvanasraddha which 
Is tho model of all srSddhas it is now time to speak of Ekoddista 
sraddha that is a modification of PSrvanasrSddha im The word 
Ekoddista means ' that in which only one deceased person 1151 
is intended (to be invoked or benefited)*. The Parvana- 
sraddha is intended for three paternal ancestors and is tens 
distinguished from Ekoddista. In San gr. 17. 2, Baud. gr. 
Ill 12.6, the Sraddhasutra of KStyayana (kandika 4), and YBj. 
I. 251-252, the points of difference between the two ate 
clearly set out. 1152 In this arSddha only one arghya is offered, 
there is only one paodra and only one pinda js offered, 
there is no adaluma (as there is in Psrvana), no agnaw 
Iwana, there are no brahmanas invited to represent the 
Visve-devas; the question about being satiated by the 
dinner is to be asked in the word 'svaditam' (did it 
taste well ) and the brahmanas reply with 'susvaditam ) 
(it had excellent taste); instead of saying 'may it be in- 
exhaustible,' the formula here used js 'May it approach (or 
wait upon the deceased person) , when the brahmanas are sent 
lay at the end of the dinner the word used as '*»«%&* 
(or delighted )' and they reply ' we are delighted ' The T.snu-

IV] Cliaraclaristics of Elcoddista 517 

Manu Itt 257, Markandeya (38. 11), Yaj. I. 356 and others, for 
one year after the death of a twice-born person till the 
sapindlkarana sraddha is performed this is the way in which 
sraddha is to be performed for the prela every month. The 
Visnudharmasutra 21. 3 provides that suitable changes (Gha) 
should be made in the mantras employed (e. g instead of 'atra 
pifcaro madayadhvam' the mantra should be 'atra pitarmadayas- 
va' (O father 1 1,S4 regale thyself here). In Ekoddista such a 
formula as 'ys ca tvam-anu' (those that come after thee) can- 
not be employed and the word 'pitr' is not to be employed ( till 
sapindlkarana is performed), but the word 'preta' (Apararka 
p. 525 quoting Saunaka-grhyaparisista). 1155 

As seen above (p 262, note 591a) Ekoddista Sraddhas 
are of three kinds, nava, navamisra-and purana Navasraddhas 
axe those that are performed till the 10th orllth day after death, 
navamisras (or misras) are those that are performed after the 
11th day till one year (or six months, according to some) after 
death. Apararka quotes a verse from Yyaghra u * that 
Ekoddista-sraddha is performed on the 11th day, on the 4th 
day, at the end of each month for a year after death and every 
year on the day of death and a verse of Katyayana that 
(ekoddista) sraddha should be performed for one who had kept 
sacred fire3 on the 11th day after the day of cremation and 
that the Dhruva sraddhas should always be performed on the 
day of death. Apararka explains ' Dhruvani' as meaning those 
that are performed after three fortnights from death. About 
the navasxaddha there is again a divergence of views. One 
meaning has already been giyen above on p 262 note 593. The 
Skandapurana VI (Nagarakhanda) 205. 1-4 and Garudapurana 
(pretakhanda 5.67-69) state that navasraddhas are nine viz. 
the three performed where a man died, where the funeral pro- 
cession rested on the way and where the burnt bones were 
collected and six more performed on the 5th, 7th. 8th, 9th 10th 
and 11th days after death. '

^ Numerous works lay down that there are sixteen sraddhas 
■which must he performed for a deceased person and that if these 
are not performed then his spirit is not freed from the condition 
of being a preta and a ptsaoa, us) There is a great deal of diver- 
gence of views about what these sixteen sraddhas are, some 
works including sapindlkarana among the 16, others excluding 
it therefrom. Gobhilasmrti 333. 67 enumerates 1IsS the 16 as 
follows: The twelve monthly sraddhas (performed every month 
on the hi hi of death), the first (i e. the sraddha onthellth 
day), two sraddhas on (a day prior to the expiry of) every six 
months from the tifchi of death and sapindlkarana are the 
sixteen sraddhas. The Garudapurana 115 ' refers to three groups 
of sixteen, one of which enumerates the 16 sraddhas as those 
performed on the 12th day (after death), after three fort- 
nights, after six months, after every month and at the end 
of the year, while the PadmapurSna" 60 enumerates them as 
follows : the sixteen srSddhas are those performed on the 4th 
day after death, at the end of three fortnights, after six months, 
after a year and twelve sraddhas performed each month (on the 
Win of death) The Kalpataru p. 25 and Brahmapurana q.by 
Apararka (p. 523) state that the 16 sraddhas are those performed 
on 4th 5th, 9th and 11th days after death and the twelve 
monthly sraddhas (on the tithi of death" 61 ). Langaksi and

others say that after performing the 16 sraddhas according to 
the procedure for Ekoddista sraddhas sapindana should be 
performed. 1162 The Madanaparijata (p. 615), the Nirnaya- 
sindhu (HI.' p. 599 ) and others say that in this conflict 
of views one should follow the usage of one's country, Vedic 
Sakha or family. There were two views about the srSddha on 
the 11th day. It Bhould be remembered that Yaj. IB.. 22 laid 
down impurity on death for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively 
for the four varnas. One view espoused by Sankha and Paithi- 
nasi was that in spite of the days of imparity not being over 
sr&ddha must be performed on the 11th day (and for the moment 
the performer becomes pure for that purpose ). The other view 
was that of the Matsyapurana and VisnudharrnasutTa 21.1 that 
the first srsddha (ekoddista) was to be performed on the 
expiry of aSauca, 

In the case of ascetics dying it is provided by Usanas 1163 
that by the fact of their taking to the order of sonny asa ( of 
the ekadandi kind in the Kaliyuga ) they have not to undergo 
the condition of being preta, no Ekoddista nor Sapindikarana 
should be performed for them by their son or other relative but 
only parvanasraddha on the 11th day and every year thereafter. 
Satatapa provides « 61 that no Ekoddista, no water, no pinda 
and no cremation rites should be offered to an ascetic nor 
mourning should be observed, but pSrvana-sraddha should be 
performed. Pracetas quoted by Mit. on Ya] I. 256 states that 
no ekoddista is to be performed for an ascetic nor sapindl- 
kaTana, hut only parvana on the day of death every year in 
Bhadrapada dark half. The Sivapurana ( Kailasa-sarnhita ) 
chapters 22 and 23 deal with the rites to be performed on an 
ascetic's death on the 11th and 12th days. 

In the Navasraddhas no inoense, no lamps are employed

omitted and so ia the word 'ami' omitted and there is no 
japn and no recital of mantras in the hearing of the brahmsnas. 
As stated in tho BrahmapurSna, the sraddhas performed m the 
house at tho ond of impurity on the 12th day, at the end of a 
month etc. aro called ekoddis^a. It follows that the rites called 
navasrSddhas offered during the days of impurity are pet- 
formed at the place of death or in the cemetery or at a place 
whore water and pinda are offered ( and not in the house ), 
vido Sm. C. ( asauca p. 176 ). In the ■navamiira sraddha mantras 
aro employed according to some. In former times and now also 
all tho 16 Sraddhas aro performed on the 11th day. Hardly any 
one waits for one year to perform Sapindlkarana. In former 
times it was laid down ( e. g. by the Mit ) that in times of 
difficulty, Sapindlkarana should be performed even before a 
year elapses after performing the sixteen sraddhas. But now 
this exception has become the rule. 

Sapindlkarana or Sapindana is the reception of a deceased 
person into'tho community bf pitrs to whom pindas are offered. 
Several times were prescribed by ancient works for this. Ace to 
thoKausltaki gr. IV. 2 this sraddha could be performed after 
tho death of the deceased at the end of a year or at the and of 
three fortnights or on the happening of a lucky event (like the 
birth of ason or a marriage) J*®*?*^? <™ S 
allowed it at the end of a year (after death) or in the 11th <x 6 h 
or 4th month or on the 12th day. The Baud. Pitrmedhasfitra D. 
13 1 mentions five times for sapindlkarana viz one year 11th, 
6th oHrth month or 12th day. The Garudapurana (Pretakhanda

commended (for the sapindana sraddha) because family usages 
are innumerable, because man's life is short and because the 
body is evanescent. The Visnu Dh S. (31.20) provides that 
for siidras 12th day after death is the only day for Sapindl- 
karana (but without Vedio mantras). Gobhila laid down that 
after Sapindikarana was performed, there was to be no per- 
formance of sraddhas every month, but Gautama (or Saunaka, 
according to Apaiarka p 543) held the view that they may be 
performed according to the procedure of ekoddista sraddhas. 
Bhattojisays 1166 that when sapindikarana is performed before 
the end of the year, then all the sixteen sraddhas must be per- 
formed before Sapindikarana, yet the monthly sraddhas should 
again be performed at their proper times for one year. Yaj. 
1. 255 and Visnu Dh. S. 21, 23 prescribe that even if Sapindi- 
karana is performed for a deceased person within less than a 
year from death still for one year food and a jar of water 
should be given to a brahmana for the whole year ( for the 
benefit of the deceased). TTsanas provides that even if the 
heirs of a deceased person are divided in wealth, still the 
naiairaddlias, the sixteen sraddhas, and sapindikarana must 
be performed by one alone 1 " 7 (e. g. the eldest son), but 
Pracetas provides that when a year has ( elapsed ) sraddha may 
be performed separately by each heir M6a . 

The procedure of Sapindana or Sapindikarana is des- 
cribed in numerous works such as the San. gr. V. 9, Kausl- 
taki gr. IV. 2, Baud Pitrmedhasfitra HL 12.12, Srsddha-sutra of 
Katyayana (kandika 5 ), Yaj. 1. 253-254, Visrmourana m. 13 27

if a man is unable to invite so many brahmanas, he should

the three paternal ancestors. He should request 'I shall unite 
the vessel for the preta with the vessels for his three paternal 
ancestors ' When permitted m the words 'do unite', he should 
cast the kusas in the vessel for the pi eta into the vessels for his 
three paternal ancestors, should keep a little water mixed with 
kusas in the vessel for the preta and distribute the rest of the 
water from the preta vessel into the three vessels for his 
ancestors with the two mantras 1149 " 'yesamSna' (VSj, S. 19.

and three for his ancestors and then the performer requests 
'J shall unite the pretapinda with the pindas for the three 
ancestors of his' ; when permitted in the words 'do unite ', the 
performer divides the pretapinda into three parts and puts each 
third into each of the three pindas with the same two mantras 
(Yaj. S 19. 45-46). The Garudapurana (J. 220.6) strikes a 
discordant note in that it states that the pretapinda is to ha 
divided m two parts, each of which is to be placed inside the 
pindas for pitamaha and prapitamaha only.

IV ] Sapindlkarana 523 

Sapindlkarana partakes of the character of both, ekoddista 
and parvana, the first applying to the preta and the 2nd to the 
three ancestors of the preta, so that in it two kinds of sraddhas 
are combined. When the sapindlkarana rite is completed by the 
giving of daksinS to the brahmanas, then the preta ceases to be 
so and himself becomes a pitr. The status of being a pi eta 
involves the experiencing of great torments due to hunger and 
thirst and becoming a pitr means being brought in contact with 
the sraddha devatas called Vasu, Rudra and Sditya. 1170 The 
word preta has two meanings, (1) a person who is dead and (2) 
one who being dead has not the sapindlkarana performed for 
him The result of sapindana is that the nn great-grandfather 
of the decaased whose sapindana is performed drops out from 
the list of pitrs „ entitled to pinda and becomes one called 
'lepabhak* (entitled to only wipings of the hand) and the former 
pieta becomes one of the pitrs and entitled to participate in the 
pindas offered at a parvanasraddha thereafter. As stated in the 
Garudapurana L 220. 2 the sapindikarana-sraddha is to be 
performed like the parvana in the afternoon. 

It may' he noted that in some works the mantras recited at 
the time of pouring the water from the preta vessel into the pitr 
vessels are different For example, the Visnu Dh. S. 21. 14 
says 1 " 2 the mantras are 'Samsrjatu tva prthivl' (May the earth 
unite thee) and 'samani va Skutih' (Rg. X. 191. 4), while the

Grhya-parisista i "3 of Mv. employs the three MadhumatI verses 
<Bg. 1 90.6-8) and the three fine verses at the end of the IJgveda 
beginning with 'sangacchadhvam' (Rg. X. 191. 2-4, 'May 
you unite '&c). 

Yaj. (L 254) and Markandeya (28, 17-18) provide that 
Ekoddista and Sapindlkarana sr&ddhas are performed for 
women also (but, not parvana nor sbhyudayika). About the 
Sapindlkarana of the mother there are somewhat conflicting 
diota. If a woman dies sonless and her husband is alive, her 
sapindana is effected with her mother-in-law (Gobhilasmrtl H. 
102 ). If a woman dies leaving no son and the husband also }s 
dead, then no sapindana can he performed for her. If she died 
either on the funeral pyre of her husband im or afterwards (as 
a Sati ) then her son should perform her sapindana with her 
husband (l. e. the son's father) and there is no separate sapin- 
dana for her. If she was married in the Ssura form or she was 
made a putnka, then the son should perform his mother's sapin- 
'dana with his maternal grandfather; while a son born of a 
woman married in the Brahma and three other proper forms 
may perform her sapindana with her husband or the paternal 
grandmother or the maternal grandfather. In the ease of these 
three alternatives xf there is a certain family usage that should 
be followed; otherwise there is an option. If a woman has a 
step-son, the latter should, perform her sapindana with his 
father as Manu IX. 183 ( « Vas. 17. 11) indicates Vide the 
Sftwi 253-254 and Sm. C. (on ssauca p 169) for dzscus- 
sion of these points and for various alternates 

The Nimayasindhu (HI. p. 388) says that there is no 
aapin^aforole whose upanayana was not performed when

he died, but if lie was more than five s years old then the 16 
sraddhas are performed for him (though not sapindana) and 
pinda is offered on bare ground. It may be noted that no 
auspicious rite like marriage in which abhyudayika sraddha is 
necessary can be performed until the sapindana of a deceased 
person of the family has been effected ( except in the case of 
such absolutely necessary ceremonies as slmantonnayana). 

Manu (V. 89-90) prescribes that no water and other rites 
like sapindikarana are offered and performed for those who had 
left off their faith, who were born of condemned mixed 
marriages, who entered ascetic orders, who had committed 
suicide (by hanging, poison &o. ), who had embraced heretical 
doctrines, for women that wilfully seek illicit connection with 
men, that did harm to their foetus or husband ( were guilty 
of abortion and murder of husband) and that were addicted to 
drinking surd. Yaj. HI 6 contains similar provisions. It has 
to be noted that every kind of suicide is not condemned by the 
ancient smrtis. Vide H. of Dh. vol, m, pp. 939, 958-9 for 
cases where suicide was not condemned. Except in those 
cases Yama (q by the "Mit. on Yaj. HI. 6 ) provides that in 
the case of the persons mentioned in Manu and Yaj. there is 
to be no asauca observed, no water offered, no tears shed, no 
cremation and no last rites. The Mit. (on Yaj. 10. 6) quotes 
Vrddha YajBavalkya and Chagaleya that in the case of those 
who are guilty of condemned suicide the procedure ofN&ra- 
yanabali should be resorted to after a year and then iraddha may 
be offered to them. Then the Mit. describes at length the pro- 
cedure of Narayanabali. Vide note 838 b p. 370 above for the 
Skandapurana, Nagarakhanda 219. 19-21 on the view that 
sraddha may be performed on the 14th of the dark half for per- 
sons who committed suicide or who met a violent death. 

The Mhyudaytka-iraddlia is to be now described, ilsv. 
gr. IV. 7 mentions in one place only four sraddhas viz. Parvana, 
Kamya, Abhyudayika and Ekoddista (note 966 above) Many of 
the sutras such as £sv. gr. II. 5. 13-15, San. gr. IV. 4, Gobhila 
gr. IV. 3. 35-37, Kausltaki gr. TV. 4, Baud. gr. III. 12. 2-5, the 
Sraddhasutra of Katyayana (kandika6) briefly describe this 
sraddha. Accordzng to most of these sutras this srSddha is 
performed when there is a lucky event such as the birth of a 
Bon, or his caula, upamajana or marriage or there is the 
commencement of a charitable (purta) act (such as the 
dedication of a well or a tank or a park to the public ) asv 



526 History of DliarmaiMra [VoL 

gr. and Gobhila gr. are very brief. They say that in this 
sraddha performed on auspicious occasions or on the under- 
taking of meritorious acts an even number of brahmanas is to 
be fed, thafthe rite is to be performed from left to right and 
that yams { barley ) are to be used instead of sesamum grains. 
As this sraddha is only a modification (vikrti) of#5rama(&s 
said by Apararkn p. 514 ) all rules of the latter will be applicable 
to the former except where special directions are given. The 
Asv. gr. parisisia II. 19, Smrtyarthasara (p. 56), Pifcrdayita 
pp. 62-71 give a compact but tolerably full description of this 
sraddha. 

In this sraddha which is to be performed in the morning 
( oxcept on tho birth of a son when it is to ba done at once ) the 
Visve-devas are called Satya and Vasu, it is performed in the 
' forenoon, the brahmanas to be invited must be even in number, 
thodarbhas aTe to be straight ( and not doublefolded ) and are 
not to be with their roots ; the performer wears his sacred thread 
in the usual form ( and not in the p> aclnuvtta form ), all actions 
are to be done from loft to right ( pradaksinam and not 
prasavyam); the word svadhais not to be used ; yava grains 
are to bo employed instead of sesamum grains, he invites them 
with tho words 'find time to attend NSndJsraddha . The 
brahmanas say 'be it so'. He says ' May you two come { to 
my house >'; they reply ' we two shall come \ The performer 
faces the east or north (but never the south); the mantra

brahmanas are eating the dinner, tlie Baksoghna mantras and 
mantras addressed to Indra and propitiatory mantras may be 
recited but not the mantras addressed to pitrs {viz. Bg. X. 15. 
1-13); when he sees that the brahmanas are satiated, he recites 
the five verses (Bg.IX. 11. 1-5) beginning with 'upasniai gayata 
narah' (Omen I sing for this soma) instead of the MadhumatI 
verses ( viz. Bg. I. 90. 6-8 ) and at the end he makes the 
brahmanas hear the mantra 'the pitrs have partaken ( of the 
food), they have regaled themselves'. The performer should 
ask 'I shall request the nandimukha pitrs to utter benedictions' 
at the stage where (in Paivana) 'aksayyodaka' is asked for, to 
which the brahmanas respond with the words 'do request.' The 
performer employs the word 'sampannam' (was it perfect) in 
asking about the gratification of the brahmanas, who reply with 
the word 'susampannam' (it was quite^ perfect). On the 
brahmanas sipping water after their dinner, he cowdungs the 
places where the dinner was taken, strews darbha grass thereon 
with their tips turned towards the east and offers thereon two 
pindas for (each of the ancestors) made with the food that 
remains after the brahmanas have eaten mixed with curds, 
jujube fruit and prsadajya '« 8 (mixture of curds and clarified', 
butter). The pindas are offered to the matrs, to the three 
paternal ancestors and the three maternal ancestors (viz. 
mother's father, mother's paternal grandfather and her paternal 
great-grandfather). Some do not offer pindas in this sraddha 
(as stated by Asv. gr. parisista IT. 19). The Pitrdayita and 
Sraddha-tattva ( Jiv. p. 297) say that no matrsraddha is to be 
performed in Abhyudayikasrsddha by the followers of the 
Samaveda. It is possible that the sraddha for the mother 
paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother was 
inspired by the Anvastakya sraddha, as the sutras from Asv 
gr. quoted below will indicate. 1173 " 

The words Nandisraddha and Vrddhisraddha are synony- 
mous WhenYig 1250 says™ that the Nandimukha pitrs shoufd 
be worshipped with pindas when there is vrddhi (a lucky or 
auspicious event), he indicates th at Nandlsr'addba and Vrddhi-

Nandlsraddha and also the occasions on which it is to be per-

sons and daughters, on entering a new house, on naming a child, 
at the time of Cfidakarma, at Slmantonnayana, on the birth of a 
son, a householder should honour the group of pitrs called Ksndi- 
mukha. The Markandeya-purana 28. 6 notes that, some desire 
that this sraddha should not have Vaisvadeva brahmanas, hut

purana notes that according to family usage some did not offer 
pindas in Vrddhisraddha U8S » 

The word Inatarah' has two meanings. Gobhilasmrti 1184 
prescribes that at the" beginning of all rites the Matrs 
together with Ganesa have to be worshipped and it names 
fourteen niatrs such as Gaurl, Padma, Saci (1 11-12). 1185 In 
the Markandeya-pur&na ( 88.11-20 and 38 ) they are said to be 
seven viz BrahmanI and others. Vide H. of Dh. vol. H pp. 
217-218 for the Mates and their worship. 1186 Apararka (p. 517) 
quotes verses to the effect that in Vrddhisraddha one must 
offer worship to the seven matrs ( BrahmanI and others ), then 
to one's mother, paternal grandmother, and paternal gieat- 
grandmother, then to the Nandlmukha pitrs and then to the 
matamahas together with their wives The Sraddhaprakasa (of 
Viramitrodaya ) quotes Vrddha-Vasistha to the effect that in 
the Matrsraddha (as part of Vrddhi-sraddha ) if a sufficient 
number of brahmanas be not available then for the groups of 
matrs and of matamahls four women ( for each group ) whose 
husbands are living and who have a son or sons should be 
invited to dinner um " and honoured. 

The Pralisamiatsanka or Pratyabdika sraddha has already

every year on the day of death ( Gobhilasmrti HI 66 ). It is

A few words may now be said about some other srSddhag. 

A well-known sraddha is the Mahalayasraddha Some of 
the PurSnas deal with this. The Padmapurana (Srsti-khanda) 
says ' In the fifth fortnight (palm) beginning from the Pull 
Moon day of AsSdha, one should perform a sraddha, whether 
the Sun is by that time in the zodiacal sign of Kanya" (Virgo) 
or not. The sixteen days when the Sun is in Kanya are equal 
to the solemn saer-ifiees which are completed with the gift of the

best of daksinas. If it is n®t possible to perform the sraddha 
in the dark half (when the Sun is in Kanya), one may perform 
it when the Sun is in Tula (Balance). When the Sun enters 
the sign of Scorpion (without a sraddha being performed), the 
Fathers go away losing all hope and after pronouncing a terri- 
ble curse (on their descendants) they return to their abode.' 1189 
The fifth fortnight from the Full Moon day of Asadha is the 
dark half of Bhadrapada. The dark half is the preserve of pitrs. 
In Bhadrapada the Sun is in the middle of its apparent motion 
in daksinayana. Therefore the dark half of Bhadrapada is 
specially chosen as the best period for sraddha to the pitrs i. e. 
for the Mahalaya The sraddha performed in Bhadrapada dark 
half is called Mahalaya-sraddha, since that fortnight is the 
abode (alaya) as it were of the malia ( i. e. festival day ) for 
' pitrs. The real idea is that the dark half of Bhadrapada is 
specially to be welcomed for a sraddha when the Sun is in Kanya 
during that fortnight and that even if the Sun is not in Kanya 
the dark half of Bhadrapada is still a good time for a sraddha to 
the pitrs. The Skandapurana lwo also says 'In the fifth fort- 
night from the Full Moon of Asadha, when the Sun occupies 
the sign of Kanya, the pitrs of him who offers a sraddha on the 
tithi of the death (of one's father) certainly derive gratification 
for one year thereafter.* The Kalpataru quotes the Bhavisya- 
purana to the effect that if a man has not performed sraddha in

phala (on sraddha p. 745) quote Vrddha-manu to the effect that 
the latter half of Bhadrapada when the Sun is inKanya is called 
Mahalaya and also Gaiacchaya. "Various views are held on the 
question of the exact day on which the Mahalayasraddha is to be 
performed, viz. it may be performed on any day from the first 
ttth of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the amavasya or from 
the fifth of the dark half to the amavasya of Bhadrapada or 
from the 8th or 10th of the dark half to amavasya or from the 
5th of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the 5th of the next fort- 
night or on any day on which the San is in EanyS or on any 
day till the Sun enters Scurpion. »« Frajapati states that there' 
are numerous sraddhas described by the PuraDas, all of them 
yield rewards but the Mabalaya (sraddha) is the most eminent 
among them. 1193

In the Mahalayasraddha the Visvedevas are Dhuri and 
Locana. This sraddha is performed for the benefit not only of 
the paternal and maternal ancestors with their "wives, but also 
for other relatives and persons that are dead (together with 
their wives, sons and husbands if these be dead ) viz one's step- 
mother, one's wife, son, daughter, paternal uncle, maternal 
unele, brother, paternal aunt and maternal aunt, sister, paternal 
uncle's son, son-in-law, sister's son, father-in-law, mother-in- 
law, acarya, upadhyaya, guiu, friend, pupil and any other 
relative. 1195 Some perform only for the paternal ancestors 
with their wives and the maternal ancestors with their 
wives. The day on which the moon is in Bharani naksatra in the 
dark half ofBhadrapada is called MahabharanI and sraddha 
performed on that day is said to be equal to Gayasraddha 
(Matsyapuranaq. by Sr. K. L p 99) The Mabalaya-sraddha 
is to be performed on the 12th tithi of Bhadrapada dark half 
in the case of a sannyasin and on no other tithi and his yearly 
sraddha is to be performed by his son according to parvapa 
method as in the case of householders. The dvadasl is sacred to 
Vismiand yatts always repeat the words ' namo Narayanaya ' 
and therefore the 12th is the special tithi for the mahalaya- 
sraddha of yatis. The Mahalayasraddha is not to be performed 
in an intercalary month ( malamasa ). 

Two more srSddhas that are performed even to this day 
may be mentioned here. One is called * Matamahasraddha * oi 
' Dauhitra-pratipad-sraddha'. A daughter's son whose parents 
are alive can alone perform a sraddha for his maternal 
grand-father (together with the maternal grand-mother if she 
also be dead) on the first tithi of the bright half of Asvina «" 
A daughter's son can perform it even if his maternal grand! 
father has a son or sons living It may be performed with or 
without pindadana (generally without it) and it maybe per- 
formed even if the daughter's son has not been invested with 
the sacred thread. The Sraddhasara notes that the matamaha- 
sraddha is based only on the usage of sistas (p. 24). 

Another is the * Avidhavanavamlsraddha ', which is per- 
formed for one's mother or other women of the family who died 
while the husbands were ali ve. It is performed on the 9th of

534 History of DharmaiSslra [Vol, 

the dark half of Bhadrapada. It ceases to be performed when 
the husband dies after the woman's death. The Nirnayasindbu 
notices several views about this and says that one should 
follow the usage of one's country 119s . According to the M»- 
kandeyapurana in this sraddha not only a brahmana bat also a 
woman whose husband is alive is to be fed and presents of s 
girdle, a garland and bangles are to be made to her. 

It will have been seen from the translation of AfiT.gr,, 
Yaj and the PadtnapurSna that daksina, according to one's 
ability, has to be given in each sraddha towards the end of the 
rite. The SkandapurSna (VI 218. 12-14) provides that what- 
ever is wanting in mantras or the proper time or m procedure 
becomes perfect by daksina. Sraddha without daksina is like 
rain on an arid place or like dancing in the dark or like singing 
before a deaf person, that he who desires the permanent 
gratification of himself and his Manes should not offer a 
sraddha without daksina. The Bsmayana shows how on the 
12th day after the death of king Dasaratha gifts of jewels, of 
hundreds of cows, wealth, food in abundance and vehicles, of 
male and female slaves, of spacious houses were made to the 
brahmanas »" The Asramavasikaparva (14 3-4) recounts 
the valuable gifts to brahmanas to honour of Bkta^&tJJ, 
Duryodhana and other fallen warriors, adding that persons 
of all varnas were treated to profuse food and&n* The 

givL in the note below.™' The Ssntiparra (chap AV 






jy] Gtving daksina 535 

states that while Yudhisthira performed the after-death cere- 
monies of the fallen heroes he erected sabhas, prapSs, water 
reservoirs ana the like intending them for each separately. 
Devala states, 'when the brahmanas have sipped water after 
dinner, daksina is to he given* and Brhaspati prescribes 
' Daksina should be given to all the brahmanas according to 
the learning of them by means of (gifts of) cows, land, gold, 
~clothes. He should do this in such a way that they feel 
satisfied , one who is well-off should do this specially.' 1201 The 
Aivamedhika-parva (62. 2-5) states that Vasudeva offered 
sraddha to his sister's son Ahhimanyu and donated to sixty 
thousand brahmana3, gold, cows, bed-steads, clothes and fed 
them. A. special rule was provided by Brhaspati that the 
clothes, ornaments, bed-stead and the like, the horse and the 
like that were used by the father during his lifetime should be 
presented to the brahmana invited for sraddha after honouring 
him with sandalwood paste and flowers. 1201 " The Anusasana- 
parva ( chapt. 96 ) states the origin of the practice of giving an 
umbrella and sandals on the completion of a sraddha. 

Something must be said about the gift of the bed-stead 
( iwjya, ) used by the deceased on the llth or 12th day after 
death. The G-arudapurana ( Pretakhanda 34. 69-89 ), Padma 
(srstikhanda 10. 12 ), the Matsyapurana highly eulogise the gift 
of sayya to a brahmana and his wife. The Matsyapurana states 
that on the 2nd day after the end of impurity on death the 
performer ( of sraddha ) should donate a bed-stead possessing 
special characteristics ; on it the golden image of the deceased 
should be placed and also fruits and clothes. After honouring 
a brahmana couple with many ornaments this should be done ; 
then a bull should be let loose (for the benefit of the deceased ) 
and the gift of a dark brown cow should also be made. 1202 The 
Garudapurana (Pretakhanda 34. 73-82 ) gives a more elaborate 
description which appears to be almost identical with the

verses of the Bhavisya quoted by Hemadri. The Bhavisya- 
purSna quoted by Hemadri ( and from Hemadri by the Nirnaya- 
sindhu p. 596 ) states the mantra to be recited viz ' just as the 
bed-stead of Krsna is never devoid of Laksml, the daughter of 
the ocean, similarly my bed may not be empty m each birth 
that I may have to undergo.' 1285 Acceptance of the gift of a 
sayya was looked down upon in former times and even 'now it 
is only the poor brahmanas ( that are not generally learned ) 
that accept this gift The Padmapuraiaa condemns the accept- 
ance of the gift of sayya in no measured terms. It says 'when 
a brahmana accepts the gift of a bed-stead, he should have to 
undergo the ceremony of upanayana again. In the Veda as 
well as in the Purana ( the gift of ) a bed-stead is everywhere 
condemned and all those who accept the gift go to hell.' lal 

Certain other matters connected with sraddhas may he 
briefly touched upon. In very ancient times twelve kinds of 
sons were recognized out of whom the ksetraja, 1MS the putrikS- 
putra and dattaka were most important All these were the 
sons of two fathers. The question mooted was : to whom were 
they to offer pindas 1 The Madanaparijata (pp 607-608) quotes 
a passage from the Harlta-dharmasutra «■ and explains it. 
Harlfca says, 'seed does not grow without afield Since irt is 
seen that both are necessary the child horn is the child of both.

( and then the ksetrin ). He ( the son) may offer two pindas to 
each grade of the ancestors or he may offer a single pinda (to the 
father and ) may repeat the names of hoth (fathers ) as to that 
single pinda. The son ( of the son of two fathers ) may repeat 
two names as to the 2nd pinda ( i. e. the pinda for paternal 
grand-father ) ; the grand-son ( of the son of two fathers ) may 
do the same as to the third pinda ( viz. the pinda for paternal 
great-grandfather ).' Manu IV. 140 and Gobhila-smrti H. 105 
say about the pntrikaputra 1207 that he presents the first pinda 
to his mother ( as she was appointed as a son ), the 2nd to her 
father and the third to his father's father. This appears to be 
one OTder in which pindas aTe to be offered by the putrikaputra, 
while Manu IX 132 sets out another method since it says that 
a pntrikaputra inherits the entire wealth of his own father if he 
is sonless and he gives two pindas (i. e. performs two sraddhas) 
for his own father and for his maternal grandfather. The San. 
Sr.S. provides 1J0S that if there he two fathers, the son should 
recite the names of both ( bijxn and ksetrm ) with reference to 
the ,same pinda. Even Yaj. says 'The son procreated according 
to the rules of nvjoga by a sonless man on the wife of another 
inherits the wealth of both and offers pinda to both.' 120 ' The Mit. 
adds that if a person appointed to procreate a son on another's 
wife has a son, then the son so begotten becomes the son of the 
ksetrin alone and not of the bljin. As the ksetraja and pntrika- 
putra have become obsolete for several centuries the subject has 
only an academic interest now. But the dattaka is still in - 
vogue and a few words must be said here about the persons to 
whom the dattaka offers pindas. The Kalpataru quotes from 
the Pravaradhyaya a passage on this point which is as

wealth; the svadka (obsequies) of Mm who gives (his son in

adopted becomes totally severed from the family of his birth.

Vrsotsarga (the letting loose of a bull). This topic has 
been dealt with by several sutra works such as the San. gr. 
EI. 11, the Kausltaki gr. HI 11 (in Benaras S. S. and HH5 in 
Madras University Series), Kathaka gr. 59, 1 ff., Paraskara gr.

some verses called gathas sung by the pitrs are Bet out one of 
which expresses the yearning of the pitrs as follows : 1213 "one 
should desire to have many sons ; since if even one (of the sons) 
goes to Gaya (and offers sraddha after his father's death) or if he 
performs a solemn horse sacrifice or lets loose a dark-coloured 
bull (the man having such a son will secure final release)'.

is set out here -, 1211 "(This ceremony) takes place on the full

about sportingly with him as your lover. May we not lack

succumb to our enemy *. He must drive away the bull together 
with the young cows in the north-eastern direction and give 
a pair of garments, gold and a vessel of bell metal to the hotr 
(officiating priest). The blacksmith should be given wages as 
desired by him and food seasoned "rith a good deal of clarified 
butter should be served to (three) brahmanas (at least). That 1219 
pool at which a bull let loose (in honour of a deceased person 
by his son or the like ) drinks water .serves (reaches) the manes. 
Wherever a bull (let loose) exulting in his strength scratches 
( cr digs up) the earth, that earth becoming abundant food and 
water waits upon the manes." 12M In the Anusasanaparva the 
pitrs are represented as saying that by letting loose a dark- 
coloured bull, by offering water mixed with sesame and by 
lighting lamps in the rains a man becomes free from the debt 
he owes to the pitrs (chap. 125. 73-74). 

In the GarudapurSna it is stated that the deceased person 
for whom a bull is not let loose on the 11th day after death 
permanently remains a pi eta, even if hundreds of, sraddhas are 
offered for him. The same Purana further provides that if a 
bull be not available on the 11th day, then the effigy of a bull 
made of darbhas and flour or clay should be symbolically let 
loose. 1 " 1 IntheBhavisyapurana the 13th- day after death is 
prescribed for the letting loose of a bull ( N. S. III. p. 505 ). 
The Nirnayasindhu says that the making of an effigy of a bull 
with clay, darbhas and flour is without authority. Even at 
present people let loose a bull but owing to the rise in the prices 
of bulls this is becoming less frequent. Several medieval digests 
such as the Pitrdayita (pp. 84, 94), Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara 
(PP. 69-77), Nirnayasindhu (DL pp. 595-596), Suddhiprakasa

pp. 225-230, Antyestipaddhati of Narayanabhatta present a far 
more elaborate description, hut from considerations of space 
thoy are passed over here. It is provided in these and other 
digests that such a bull should not be seized by anyone nor made 
to draw a vehicle and the cow or cows let loose along with 
him should not be milked nor confined in a cow-pen. A bull is 
not lot loose for a deceased woman, but a cow may be donated 
together with its calf without being branded and after being 
decked with sandal-wood paste. 1 * 21 " 

What is the idea underlying the letting loose of a bull 
after the death of a person? If a conjecture may be hazarded, 
it appears to have been thought that if a bull were freed from 
toil ( that is the lot of most bulls ) and placed in the midst of * 
pleasant surroundings, that act of the relatives of the deceased 
may in a vicarious manner conduce to the happiness of the 
departed spirit in the other world. 

Ono remarkable matter about sraddhas is yet to be 
mentioned. The Baud, grhyasesasutra IE, 19, the LingapurSna 
(II 45. 8-90, some of which are quoted by Sr. Pr ; pp 363-364), the 
Kalpataru (on sraddha pp. 277-279), Hemadri (Sr. pp. 1704-1717), 
the Sraddhaprakasa (pp. 361-371) and a few other digests describe 
the procedure of Jivat-iraddha or Jtva-srSddba, which a man 
was allowed to perform for the benefit of his own soul, while 
he was himself alive. Baudhayana's being probably the most 
ancient extant description it is briefly set «* *«* A man

He kindles the fire according to the general 12M procedure laid 
down for homa, spreads round it darbJuzs, cooks food on the fire 
and offers from the cooked food four oblations of food into the 
fire; the first is made after first r9citing the Puronuvakya 1M2 « 
(invitatory prayer) ' catvari'srnga * ('Agni has four horns,* 
Rg. IV. 58. 3, Tai. A X. 10. 2 ) and offers the oblation with the 
Yajya ( offering prayer ) ' tridha hitam ' ( placed in three plates, 
Rg. IV. 58. 4) The Puronuvakya and Yajya of the 2nd oblation 
of rice are ' tatsavifeur varenyam ' ( Bg. BX 62. 10, Tai. S, I. 
5 6 4) and 'yojayitrl sunrtanam*. Of the third oblation the 
Puronuvakya and Yajya are respectively ' ye catvarah ' ( Tai. 
S V. 7. 2. 3) and ' Dve srutl ' (?,g. X. 88. 15, Tai Br. \ 4. 2. 3 ); 
the Puronuvakya and Yajya of the 4th oblation are respectively 
* agne naya' ( $g 1. 189 1, Tai. S. L 114. 3 ) and ' ya tirasoi ' 
( Br. Up. VL 3 1 ). 12a . Then he offers oblations of clarified 
butter with the Furusasukta of 18 verses (Vaj. S. 31. 1-18, Tai. 
A. Bl 12) and 1008, 108 or 28 oblations of clarified butter 'with 
the Gnyatrl verse. Then he goes to a spot where four roads 
meet, makes a gift of the needle, goad, ragged garment, the 
rope to a short-statured brahmana who has a dark skin and 
having made him repeat the words 'May the servants of Yama 
be gratified' he places the jars on grains of rice. Having 
wound round the jars that are full of water threads he prepares 
an effigy of a human being, three threads for the head, three 
for the mouth, 21 for the neck, 4 for the body, two on each arm, 
one for the male organ, five for each of the feet with the words' 
'May the revered Yama be pleased." Then making ready the 
chair, washing it with pancagauya, he makes the effigy of a human 
being on black antelope skin with palasa stalks, he establishes 
the pranas in the effigy made on the jar and placing his body 
on the.body made with stalks h e should sleep. When he rises,

with clarified butter. He should give dinner to brahmanas for 
the gratification of the servants of Yama. On the 4th day he 
burns (the effigy) with mantras. He should offer water and 
pinda with the words *pinda to me of such and such a gotra for 
benefit in the next world , smdha namah.' With these words he 
should bring to a close the rite. He should observe impurity 
for ten days for himself, but his agnates have not to observe 
impurity for him. On the 11th day he performs ekoddjsta. They 
also cite the following verse 'one who is in distress, a woman 
and. a sadra having burnt one's body (i. e effigy) with mantras 
should perform all rites on that very day. This is the revela- 
tion.' In the oase of women the rite is performed silently or 
with (?) Vedic mantras. Id this way he should perform his own 
sraddha every month for a year and at the end of each year 
up to twelve years. And then he should stop. When he is not 
able to do all these ( himself) his son and the like may perform 
them. They also reoite the following verse; 'Although heirs may 
be alfvo one may perform one's sraddha while alive, having 
quickly set about doing everything according to the rules, 
except Sapindana. One should not make delay as to the time 
specified above, sinoe life is evanescent '." 

It may be noted that the Baud, grhyasesasutra IE, 22 
contains a very brief procedure of the same rite, but therein 
two verses of Kanva and one of Visnu are quoted. Jt appears 
that this is a later addition. The text of Baud. grhyasesasQtra 
IH 19 is quoted by Sr. Pr. pp. 361-363. But the Sraddha- 
prakasa also quotes a long passage from the Lingapursna and 
explains it ( pp. 363-368 }. The procedure in the Lingapurana, 
however, materially differs from that of BaudhSyana. It is 
passed over here from considerations of space. ThoSrsddhn- 
mayukha also gives an elaborate description. Some of its 
provisions are stated here. In Jivat-sraddha the word prcla 
should nowhere be used. An effigy of the person is made with 
fifty kusas and is to be burnt by another with the mantra 
•kravyadam-agnim' ( Sg. X. 16. 9 ). The person hastokmde 
fire on the banks of a river with his face to the «»* ™«| . ^ 
grhya fire or ordinary fire and has to dig up a pit and make a 
prayer to the earth as in the case of an actual death • 

In the Bombay University Library there is a Ms. of J «*- 
sradl ascribed to Saunaka in the Bhadkamkar Collection. 



IV]' * Sraddha to himself by one living' 545" 

It cdntains a "far mora elaborate procedure ' than" that of 
Baudhayana and is in prose. It contains many of the provisions 
of Baudhayana. Further details are passed over here. - , - 

The provision of a sraddha for a living person offered 
by himself is a perversion of the ancient idea of sraddha. 
The basic and fundamental conception of - a sraddha was 
to gratify the spirits of deceased ancestors. People had gone 
crazy with the idea of sraddhas and invented this new .mode 
to satisfy, that craze. I have known persons that performed 
Jlvat-sraddha, though they had sons, younger brothers and 
nephews who would have certainly performed sraddhas for 
them on their death. 

It is customary to make a gift of a cow with a calf tod 
brahmana, preferably a kapila cow, on the' 2nd day after the 
period of asauoa Often times this is the only cow given, and the 
cow called VaitaranI referred to above (p. 183, note 427) is rarely 
donated in the midst of the sorrow and turmoil immediately on 
the death of a dear and near relative. A declaration is first 
made that a gift of a cow will be made and then water is j>oured 
on the hand of a brahmana. Then holding kusas in his hand 
the donor makes a gift of the cow with a formula noted 
below 1124 . The donee replies with the words 'om svastj' (Yes, 
may it be well! }. Then daksina (in gold or silver coins) is 
given and the brahmaDa says ' om svasti ', holds the tail of the 
cow and repeats a Kamastuti (eulogy of Kama) las according 
-to the recension of the Veda he has studied. The Annsasana- 
parva( 57. 28-29) eulogises the gift of a kapila cow with the 
calf, given with a milking pail of bell-metal, whose horn tips 
are decked with gold, by stating ,that such a gift not only saves 
the donor in the other world but also his sons, grandsons' and 
family for seven generations. The Anusasanaparva (77.10 ff) 
sets out a legend why the kapils cow is the best of all cows. 

ThePuranas and digests devote a good deal of space to 
sraddhas at tlrthas and at Gaya. Vide Atri 55-58, Vayupurana 
?\ M ^ Semadri (on Sr.) pp. 1568 ff and 1575 ff. This sub- 
ject will be briefly dealt with in the section on tirtlns '

5 *6 i Astory of Dharmainstra [Vol, 

•Much is Said on the question whether sraddhaa should be 
performed in the intercalary month. The intercalary month is 
called by various name3, viz. Malimluoa {Ksthaka Sam. 38. 
14), las Samsarpa or Arnhasaspati (Vs.) S. 7.30 and 22.31), Mals- 
masa, Adhimasa. An intercalary month is known even to the Tjtg- 
veda (ftg, i 25.8). The vendor of soma and the thirteenth month 
are condemned as pSpa (sinful) in the AitareyaBrahmana 130 . 
The PurSnas tried to bolster up the intercalary month by Calling 
it Parusottama-masa (1. e. the month of Visnu) hut the original 
stigma attaching to the 13th month seems to have persisted. 
The general rule about an intercalary month is stated by the 
G-rbyaparisista. 1M8 'the month called Malimluea is polluted 
and springs from sin; it is condemned for all acts; it should be 
discarded in all rites in honour of gods and pita.' But 
exceptions to this sweeping prohibition have been recognised, 
Harfta provides 1235 that all sraddhas that come after Bapindana 
are not to be performed in an intercalary month, VySsa laid 
down 12 * that such ceremonies as jstakarma, annaprasana, the 
navaarSddhas, sraddha on Magha and the thirteenth tithi, the 
sixteen sraddhas, bath, gifts, japa and srSddha at the time of 
the eclipse of the sun or moon— these should be performed even 
in an intercalary month. The SmrtimuktSphala concludes 
(p. 728 ) that there is no blemiBh in performing a sraddha in on 
interealary month provided it is to be performed before the end 
of one year from death. It is provided byBhrgu 1 ® that the 
samvatsarika sraddha of those who die in an i ntercalary month

may be performed in the intercalary month, but if there be 
none such then in the ordinary month of the same name. 
When the tifchi for performing a sraddha comes and there is 
then an intercalary month, Vrddha-Vasistha says that sraddha 
should be performed in both months. 1232 

Further discussion about what may be done in Malamasa 
and what is prohibited therein will be taken up in the section 
on Kala. The question as to. the day on which a sraddha is 
to he performed if the titht is spread over two days or if there 
is a Ksaj/a of the hthi will also be discussed in that section. 

Some of the works on sraddha such as the Frthvl-candro- 
daya deal with what is called * sanghata-sraddha.' J232a When 
on the same day several persons die, but not at the same time, 
then the sraddhas for them should be performed, as said by 
Bsyasrnga, in the order in which they died. But if five or six 
persons die at the same time on the same day (as when a vessel 
sinks in the sea or a market is burnt 'down all at once ), then 
the order in which sraddhas are to be performed is determined 
by the nearness of relationship to the performer of sraddha in 
the case of each. For example, if a person's wife, son, brother 
and paternal uncle meet death at the same time, then the order 
should be this that the sraddha of the wife is performed first, 
then of the son, then of the brother and then of the uncle. If 
the parents die at the same time by accident, then the father's 
cremation or other rites should be first performed and then of 
the mother. 

Provision is made if the performance of a sraddha is 
rendered impossible by some obstacle. Rsyasrnga provides l333

'if Impurity (on death) intervenes when a sraddha Is to bs 
offered to the pfrrs, sraddha should he offered at the end of the 
period of imparity. If an obstacle arises at the time when an 
etoddista is to he performed, the sraddha should be performed 
in another month on the same tithi \ This last refers to a 
monthly Sraddha. If any of the sixteen sraddhas fails owing 
to an obstacle it should be performed on the amavSsya or letter 
still on the 11th day of the dark half. If there is an ohstacla 
owing to impurity on death in the performance of a monthly 
sraddha or yearly sraddha it should he performed at the end of 
the impurity or on amavasya. 13 * The Padmapurana 
(Pattlaihanda 101. 68-70) provides similar rules. If the 
obstacle .is the performer's illness or his inability to collect 
materials or his wife being in her monthly illness, he may offer 
amasraddha descrihed above. 

B may he -noted* that -while great emphasis was laid on 
inviting a very learned brahmana at a sraddha, that ohjeet was 
often frustrated in practice by the provisions made in certain 
smrfis that one 1235 should not partake of sraddha food for 
three years after sspiadana (which is often one year after death)

placed before brahmanas was that one, though entitled to 
accept gifts on acconnt of his vedic learning and tapas, should 
not accept gifts, if he desires to secure the highest world (Ya]. 
I. 213), while Manu IV. 186 affirms '«* that though entitled to 
accept gifts a brahmana should not again and again resort to 
that method, since the spiritual power that he acquires- by 
Vedic study is lost by accepting gifts. Manu "TV. 85-86 
(= Padma V. 19. 336-237) say that acceptance of a gift from 
the king is terrible (in its consequences) and Padma warns 
that gift appears sweet like honey but is like poison (i e. deadly 
in its effects). This reasoning applied with greater force t o 
officiating and dining at a sraddha, where not only gifts are to 
be received, but also sumptuous food that will please the palate 
is' served in abundance, 

' It has been seen above how the most ancient' literary 
monument, viz the Ugveda, shows that the funeral rites per- 
formed immediately after death were prompted by affectionate 
concern for the departed spirit mingled -with some element of 
fear, that the object of those rites was to provide sustenance to 
the departed spirit and to endow it with- an intermediate body 
before it became one of the pitrs. - It has also been found 'that in 
the most ancient times of which we have literary evidence, 
there were rites for the worship of ancestors, being the Pinda- 
pitryajfla performed every month on ainavasya, the Mahspitr- 
yajfia performed in the Sakamedha and the Astaka sraddhas. 
Gradually the rites for deceased ancestors became more and 
more frequent, all-inclusive and elaborate, so that ultimately an 
exaggerated importance came to be attached to the cult of 
sraddhas over which there was an enormous expenditure of 
time, effort and wealth. The question now arises what Indians 
of the 20th century should do about sraddhas. One finds that in 
these days when many brahmanas even do not engage in any of 
the five daily obligatory yajnas (the panca-yajnas), tbey are so- 
licitous to offer sraddha at least once a .year to their ancestors 
The following may be therefore suggested as a via media far 
all kinds of people. Those who have faith in the duty of 
performing sraddhas and their efficacy for the benefit of

mind the emphatic admonition of Mann (III 125-126), 
the Kfirmapurana H. %%. 27, Padmapurana V. 9. 98 1B7 
that one should desist from extravagance in the matter of 
srlddhas, particularly in the number of brahmanas to be 
invited. Those whose faith is shaken or shattered by the 
onrush of modern ideas and English education or firm belief in 
the doctrines of karma and punarjanma should also remember 
one thing. The main underlying conception of sraddha is 
certainly admirable, viz. a tender and affectionate regard for 
one's near and dear relatives. It is a good practice to set apart 
at least one day in a year for the remembrance of one's near 
and dear relatives that are no more, to invite relatives, friends, 
and learned people to a dinner in memory of the dead and to 
bestow monetary gifts on poor hut learned persons of oharacfcer 
arib" devoted to the practice of plain living and high thinking, 
This will he in keeping with our past traditions and will also 
give a new orientation to and infuse new life into practices and 
usages that have become lifeless and meaningless to maiiy 
people. From very ancient times one of the fundamental con- 
ceptions of our faith has been the idea of three debts owed to 
sages, gods and pitrs. The debt owed to the ancestors is paid 
off by the procreation of a son who would offer pindas to his 
/and therefore also to his father's) ancestors. This is a grand 
conception. Nothing can be more sublime than the formula 
which one has to repeat at the time of offering Pl ndas and 
water (with sesame) at Gay* «may those of my ancestors that 
are in the form of pretas be all satiated by means of the (balls

CHAPTER XI 

TIRTH AYlTRA ( pilgrimages to holy places ) 

All religions have laid great emphasis on the sacredness 
of oertain localities and have either enjoined or recommended 
with great insistence pilgrimagea to them. Among the five 
incumbent praotioal religious duties 1237 of a Moslem, pilgrimage 
at least once in his life to Mecca and Medina, the birth place 
and burial place of the prophet Mohammad, is one. The four 
places of pilgrimage for Buddhists have been the place of the 
birth of Buddha ( LumbinI or Rummindei ), the placB where he 
attained perfect enlightenment ( Bodh Gaya ), the place where 
he set in motion the wheel of dharma by delivering his first 
sermon (at Sarnath near Benares) and the place where he 
passed away into the state of nirvana (Kusmara). Vide 
MahaparinibbSnasutta (S B.E vol, XL p 90). For Christians 
Jerusalem has been the holiest place and no religious com- 
munity except the Christians undertook in historic times 
several great military pilgrimages. The crusades were launched 
to free the Holy Land of Christians from the domination of 
Moslems. In spite of what Gibbon says las somewhat cynically 
about those who joined the crusades, it must be admitted that 
there were thousands among the crusaders who risked their 
lives and fortunes in the pursuit of an ideal. In India holy 
places have played a very important part. Large rivers, 
mountains and forests have always been venerated as sacred

and as the abodes of gods. In ancient and medieval India 
pilgrimages brought many advantages to the community as 
well as to the pilgrims themselves. Though India was divided 
into many kingdoms and the people of India followed several 
cults and sub-cults, pilgrimages tended to foster the idea of the 
essential and fundamental unity of Indian culture and of India 
also. Benares and Bamesvara were held sacred by all Hindus, 
whether they hailed from the north of Tndia or from the 
peninsula. Though the Hindu community was broken up into 
numerous castes and suffered from caste exclusiveness, pilgrim- 
ages tended to level up all men by bringing them together to 
the same holy livers or shrines. The traditions associated with 
holy places, the discipline through which the pilgrims passed, 
association with holy and philosophic men and the whole atmos- 
phere and environment at th thas made it easy for pilgrims to 
remain at a high spiritual level and inculcated in them a mood 
of reverence that lasted long even after they returned from the 
pilgrimage. Pilgrimages supplied the much needed stimulus 
to draw ordinary men away from selfish pursuits and to make 
them think of the higher and more enduring moral and spiritual " 
values These obvious benefits and the belief that a holy 
place was the abode of some divinity led ancient dharmasastra 
writers to lay emphasis on visits to tlrthas The Visnu Dh. S. 
provides 12 *° that the dharma common to all men comprises the 
following: forbearance, truthfulness, restraint of the mind, 
cleanliness, charity, control of the senses, ahimsa, obedience to' 
elders, vmting holy places, compassion, straightforwardness,

beauty so that her mind could come out of its world of narrow necessities 
and realize its place in the Infinite This was the reason why in India a 
*hole people who once were meat-eaters gave up taling animal food to 
cultivate the sentiment of universal sympathy for hfe, an event umque in 
the mstory of mankind ■ There is a fundamental difference m the outlook 
of modern %yesterner s and that of ancient and medieval Indians (which

freedom from avarice, honouring gods and btabmanas and 
freedom from jealousy. Modem men whose faith in some of 
the aspects of the religions beliefs of our forefathers has bean 
weakened or altogether sapped by the sight of the professional 
ministrants at the tirthas and their rapacity and ignorance 
should not judge the ancient attitude towards tirthas harshly. 

The word tlrtha occurs frequently in the Bgveda and othar 
Yedic samhitas. In several passages of the Bgveda tirtha 
appears to mean a road or a way (e. g. in Bg. L 169 6 ' tirtho 
naryah paumsyani tastbuh*, Eg l 173 11 'tlrthe aaccha 
talrsanam-oko', Jig IV, 29. 3 'karan-nalndrah suttrthabhayam 
ca.' In some places tirtha may be taken to meau a ford in a 
river, as in Bg YDl 47. 11 ' ' sutlrtham-arvato yatlunu no 
neaathasugam &C, Bg. I. 46. 8 'aritram vara divas-prthu 
tirthe sindhunam rathah '. In Bg. X 31 3 ' tfrthe no dasmam- 
upayantyumah', tirtha probably means 'a holy place'. _On 
Bg VIH.19. 37 'SuvSstva adbi tugvam' the Nirukfca IV 15 
explains that SuvSstu is a river and tugvan means Hrtte 
( either a ford or a holy spot ) In the Tai,S. VI 1. 1. 1-2 u " 
it is said that the sacrificer is to bathe at a tlrtb a (prob abl , -n 
holy river). The Eudras are said to prowl "»»»» t'i*^", ^

them (for bathing, austerities &o. ). TIrtha, therefore, means 
a locality or spot or expanse of water which gives rise to the 
accumulation of righteousness (merit) owing to its own 
peculiar nature without any adventitious circumstance ( such 
as the presence of Salagrama near it ). 1243 Or it is hetter to 
say that those localities that have been technically spoken of 
by wise and great sages as tirthas are tirthas, just as Panini 
employs such technical terms as Nadi and Vrddhi in his 
grammar. The SkandapuTana 12 ' 4 says that a spot of the earth 
resorted to by ancient good men for the collection of merit is 
called ttrtha and that the main thing is to go to (i. e associate 
with holy ) men and pilgrimage is only a secondary object. 

In the Rgveda waters, rivers in general and certain named 
rivers 1MS are referred to with great reverence as holy and are 
deified. In Rg VIL 49 the refrain of all four verses is ' may 
the divine waters protect me * ( ts apb devir-iha mamavantu ). 
In 5g. VII. 49. 1 waters are spoken of as purifying ( punsnah ). 
Rg. VIL 47, X. 9, X. 30 1M6 are hymns addressed to waters as 
divinities. They are said to purify a man not only physically 
but are also invoked to rid a man of all sins and lapses from 
the right path. The Tai S. IL 6. 8, 3 asserts that all deities are 
centred in waters (apo vai sarva devatah). In the Atharvaveda 
1217 (£ 33jq waters are described as holy and purifying and are 
invoked to confer happiness. About twenty rivers in all

flood of the Sarasvati impinging by its powerful waves against 
the tops of hills is referred to in $g. VI. 61. 2 and 8 "*>. In 
VII. 96. 1, Sarasvati is spoken of as asurya (of divine origin) 
among rivers. Sacrifices are said to have heen performed on 
theDrsadvatl, the Spaya and Sarasvati (Rg. HI 23. 4). In 
Rg. II 41. 16 Sarasvati is called the best of rivers and goddesses 
(ambifcame nadltame devitame SaTasvati). Rg. L 3. 11-12 
praise 1251 Sarasvati as a river and a deity, as a purifier 
(pavaha), as the impeller of sweet but truthful words and the 
inspirer of good thoughts and as bringing to notice its great 
flood of waters. From Rg. VII. 95. 2, V3X 49. 2 and I 71. 7 it 
is obvious that the Rgvedic sages knew that the seven rivers 
fell into the sea. It would he proper to hold that the seven 
rivers are Sindhu {Indus), the five rivers of the Fanjab and 
the Sarasvati. Though from the Rgveda passages cited above 
it appears that in the times of the hymns of the Rgveda Sara- 
svati was a big river with abundant waters, that it flowed 
between the Yamuna and Sutudrl (X. 75. 5), in the times of 
the Brahmanas it disappeared in the sands It is now gene- 
rally identified with the modern Sarsuti which is lost in the 
desert at Bhatnair. The Vaj. S. 34. 11 says that five rivers 
together with their tributary streams fall into Sarasvati. 12s2 
There were three sattras called Sarasvata, viz the first in hon- 
our of Mitra and Varuna, the 2nd for Indra and Agni and the 
third for Aryaman The dlksa (consecration ceremony) was 
to be parfoTmed on the south bank of "the dry bed of the Saras-

in the times of the Ait. Br. and long before it the bed of the 
Sarasvatl was dry. Devala ,KS mentions several places as 
Sarasvata tSrthas. The Bgveda ls56 VIII. 6.28 appears to hold 
that the valleys of mountains and the confluences of rivers are 
sacred. Mountains have been held by most ancient peoples to 
be the abodes of gods. Mount Parnassus north of Delphi was 
one of the most holy mountains in classical Greece and 
Olympus was supposed to be the home of the gods. In the 
Rgveda Parvata is a dual deity with Indra 'O, Indra and 
Parvatal may you two sharpen (or purify) us (our intellects)"

described as issuing from the lap of mountains. Here the word 
'Parvata' is used in its ordinary sense. The Atharvaveda 12ss

the same sutra 1Z59 stating that the 'deia& (localities) that are 
holy and hence destroyers of sin are all mountains, all riyers, 
holy lafeeB, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings .of sages (rsis), 
cowpens and temples of the gods ' The Vayupurana 126 ° and 
Kurma state that all parts of the Himalaya are holy, the Ganges 
is holy everywhere, all rivers falling into the sea and all seas 
are holy. The Padmapurana (Bhumikhanda 39. 46-47) says 
that all rivers, whether flowing through a village or a forest, 
are holy and that where no name of a tlrtha on rivers is known 
it should he called Visnutirtha. Kahdasa speaks of the 
Himalaya as deuatatma (as vivified by the presence of gods) in 
the Kumarasambhava (ID. The Bhagavata V. 19.16 names

jy] Effect of holy places on the mind 561 

Being is partially revealed in such, surroundings. In Protestant 
Europe and the U. S. A, hardly anyone performs a pilgrimage 
to a holy place in these days. Instead, they tour different 
countries for rest, health and in search of natural beauty and a 
respite from humdrum existence But pilgrimage to a place 
supposed to be holy for the curing of disease is not Tare even 
now. When one reads a work like that of Louis Oarell, a 
great surgeon and a winner of the Nobel prize, on the miracles 
worked at Lourdes in France (in 'a Journey to Lourdes') one 
sees that pilgrimage has taken on a new motive in the West. 
Similarly, pilgrimage to the tombs of unknown warriors has 
become common owing to the two world wars. 

In Eg X. 146 a large forest lwl (Aranyani) is invoked as 
a deity. The Vamanapurana mentions 12M seven forests in 
Kuraksetra as holy and as removers of sin, viz. Kamyaka, 
Aditivana, Vyasavana, Phalaklvana, Suryavana, Madhuvana 
and Punyasltavana, 

In the Sutras and ancient smrtis like those of Manu and 
Yajfiavalkya tlrthas do not occupy a very prominent position. 
But in the Mahabhsrata and the Puranas they are highly lauded 
and placed even above sacrifices. In the Vanaparva i2a a'com- 
parison is made between sacrifices to gods and pilgrimages. 
Sacrifices require numerous implements, collection of materials, 
the co-operation of priests and the presence of a wife and so'

are without a wife and without friends, who are helple The 

secured by performing such sacrifices as Agnistoma in which 
large fees are paid (to priests); therefore visiting holy places is 
supenor to sacrifices. But the Mahabh&rata (Vanaparva U 
9-12 and AnuSasana 108. 3-4) lays the greatest emphasis on the 
cultivation of high moral and spiritual qualities if the full 
reward of pilgrimages is to be reaped. It says «* 'He whose 
hands, feet and mind are well controlled and who possesses know- 
ledge, austerities and a good reputation derives the (full) reward 
of pilgrimages. He who turns his face away from receiving gifts 
and is content with what little he gets and is free from vanity 
obtains the rewards of pilgrimages. He, who is free from hypoc- 
risy (or deceit), is not engaged in various undertakings (for 
earning money), is not a heavy eater, has subdued his senses and 
is (therefore) free from all sins; so also he who does not fly into 
a rage, who always speaks the truth, who is firm in his 
observances, and acts towards all beings by treating them like 
himBelf, obtains the full reward of pilgrimages'. The idea 
Beams to be that pilgrimages may help to remove the sins of 
men who are not possessed of the above characteristics, while 
those who possess these acquire a great store of merit in 
addition. The Skanda (KasTkhanda 6.3) asserts 'snSna cannot 
be predicated of a man whose body alone is flooded with water; 
that man who is plunged in restraint of senses, who is pure, 
relieved of ail taint and is stainless, is alone to be called snata' 
( as having had a bath ). The Anusasana has almost the same

(or wise) man visiting tlrthas with faith and controlling his 
senses would he purified even if he has been guilty of sins; 
what need is there to say about him whose actions have been 
pure? One who has no faith, who is full of sins, whose mind 
is not free from doubts ( about the rewards of pilgrimages and 
the rites there ), who is an atheist and who is bent on bad 
reasoning— these five do not reap the rewards of pilgrimages *. 
The Skandapurana (1.1.31.37) remarks that all holy places, 
sacrifices and various gifts are meant for cleansing the mind 
(of its sins and sinful proclivities, manah-suddhi ). The 
Padmapurana (IV. 80. 9 ) remarks ■ sacrifices, vratas, tapas and 
dana cannot be carried out fully in the Kali age; but bathing in 
the Ganges and taking the name of Hari are free from all 
defects. The Visfiudharmottarapurana 1266 puts the matter very 
clearly when it says 'When resort is made to a tlrtha, it 
removes the sins of the sinful and tends to the increase of 
merit in the case of the good and that a holy place yields fruit 
to men of all varnas and asramas.' Some of the Puranas (such 
as Skandapurana, Kasikhanda 6, Padma, Uttarakhanda, 237) 
say that in addition to the holy places on land ( bhauma ) there 
are certain virtues that may be called mental tlrthas ( in a 
figurative sense ). According to them ' truthfulness, forbear- 
ance, restraint of the senses, compassion for all beings, 
straight-forwardness, charity, self-control, contentment, celibacy 
(brahmacarya), sweet speech, knowledge, patience, austerity, are 
tlrthas and the highest tirfcba is purity of mind.' They further 
state that a man who is avaricious, wicked, cruel, hypocritical 
and immersed in pleasures of senses is still sinful and impure 
even if he bathes in all tirthas and that fish are born and die 
in holy waters but they do not go to heaven because their minds 
are not purified and that even charity, sacrifices, austerity,

cleanliness, frequenting sacred places, learning— a]] these are 
not tirihas, if the mind is not pure 12&7 The BrahmapurSna 
( 25.4-6 ) states ' a heart that is wicked is not purified, by 
baths at holy places, • just as a vessel in which s«ro( liquor) 
was carried remains impure even after being washed 
with water hundreds of- times, that tlrthas, gifts, iratas, 
or "( residence in) hermitages do not purify a man whose 
heaTt is wicked, who resorts to hypocrisy and whose senses run 
away ( are uncontrolled ). Wherever a man who has his senses 
under control may dwell, there are present Knruksetra, Prayaga 
and Puskara,'. The Vamanapurana has a fine 1267 '' Bupala about 
the soul heing a river full of the water of control, flowing with 
truth and having character as the bank and the waves of 
■compassion (for all baings) and states that the soul cannot be 
purified by water. The Padmapurana (It. 39. 56-61) extends 
the' meaning and scope of tlrthas by remarking that places 
where Agnihotra and sraddha are performed, a temple, a house 
where Veda is being studied, a cowpen, the place where a soma 
drinker dwells, parks, a place where the Asvattha .exists, a 
place where PurSna is being recited or where one's teacher 
stands or where a chaste housewife dwells, or where a father 
'and a worthy son dwell are all holy. 

Numberless tlrthas and holy shrines have been mentioned 
from ancient times. The Matsyapurana states j<<* *^tVsyu

enumerated in detail even in hundreds of years. ( -The 
Vanapaiva ,J69 remarks that Naimisa is the ( best ) tlrtha on 
the earth and Puskara in the serial region, while, Kuruks,etra 
is the most distinguished in all the three worlds and that all 
the ten thousand orores of tirthas are present in Puskara 
( chap 82.21 ) New tirthas were added from time to time and 
the monetary benefits derived by the permanent residents and 
particularly by the tlrtha priests led them to prepare numerous 
m&hstmyas of an apocryphal character and father them on 
Vyasa, the reputed author of the Mahabharata and the Puranas. 
Most of the writers of digests on tirthas follow a process of 
selection. The Tirthakalpataru of Laksm?dhara, one of the 
earliest digests ( about 1110-1120 AD ), devotes more than half 
the work to Y&ramst and Prayaga alone, assigns only two or 
three pages to such famous tirthas as Puskara, Prthudaka, 
Kokamukha, Badarikasrama, Kedara. The Nrsimhaprasada 
(TirthasSra) mostly deals with tothas in the Deccan and 
southern India such as Setubandha, Pundarlka (modern 
PandhaTpur), Godavari, Krsna-venya, Sarmada. The Tri- 
sthallsetu of Narayanabhatta devotes two-thirds of it to Benares 
and its sub-tathas and the rest to Prayaga and Gaya. This 
unequal treatment arose from various causes, such as the locali- 
ties where the authors lived, their familiarity with the holy 
places and their predilections. There was also another tendency 
among the authors of Puranas, Mahatmyas and digests 
viz. that of great exaggeration and over-statement which is 
often repellent. If a man reads the description of one tlrtha 
and does not discount much as sheer hollow laudation, he is 
likely to feel that a pilgrimage to a certain tirtha will yield 
all the desires in this life as well in the next and that after 
visiting a holy tlrtha like Kasl or Prayaga he need not go to 
any other tirtha, nor need he perform any yajBa or act of charity 
and the like. A few striking passages may be cited here The 
Vanaparva remarks that «» even gods and sages secured

perfection at Puskara and that whoever takes a' bath there and 

devoutly worships gods and his pitrs secures rewards ten times 

of what the performance of Asvamedha might give. About 

this very tirtha viz. Puskara, the Padmapurana says that there 

is' no holier tirtha in this world. The Vanaparva (83. 145) in 

its eulogy of Prthudaka asserts that Kuruksetra is holy, that 

SarasvatI is' holier than Kuruksetra and that Prthudaka is 

holier than all other tlrthas The Matsyapurana puts the 12J1 

comparative holiness of several tirthas thus 'the waters of the 

Sarasvatt purify after (one bathes for) three days, those of 

Yamuna in seven days, those of the Ganges at once, while the 

water of the Narmada purifies a man at sight of it.* hi its 

eulogy of V&ranasl the Kurma-puraDa states 'there is no place 

higher than Vsranasi nor will there be one' (L31 64). The 

inveterate habit of exaggeration goes so far that it is said that 

by merely residing in KasI till one's death not only does a man 

become free from the great sin of brahmana murder but from 

the never-ending cycle of births and deaths and is not born 

again 1272 The Lingapurana says the same thing. The Vamana- 

purau'a remarks IJW that muUi (release from samsara) can be 

secured in four ways, viz. by knowledge of Brahman, by sraddha 

at Gays, by loss of life in repelling the carrying away of cows 

and by residence in Kuruksetra and that those who diem 

Kuruksetra never come down (to the earth) Mere residence

K&sl forever, ' ' * j " 

The Brahmapurana classifies tltthas into four divisions 137S 
viz. daiva ( created by gods ), asura (those associated with such 
asuras as Gaya ), arsa ( those established by sages ) such as 
Prabhasa, Naran&rayana and manusa ( created by kings like 
Ambarisa, Manu, Kuru ) and provides that each preceding one 
is superior to each succeeding one. It enumerates six rivers 
to the south of the Vindhya and six rivers having their 
sources in the Himalayas as most holy and as devatlrthas, viz. 
Godavarl, BhimaTathl, Tungabhadra, Venika, Tap!, Payosnl, 
Bhagirathl, N armada, Yamuna, SarasvatI, Visoka, and Vitasta. 
Similarly, Kasi.Puskara and Prabhasa are devatlrthas (Tlrthapr. 
p 18). The Brahmapurana (175. 31-32) assigns daiva, asura, 
arsa and manusa tirthas respectively to the Kita, Treta, 
DvapaTa and Kali yugas. 

There is a good deal of discussion in the Puranas and 
digests about those who are entitled or have the eligibility or 
capacity (adlukaia) for tirtbayatra. The Vanaparva 1 * 76 
provides that brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, when 
they have bathed in holy places, are not born again. The same 
work further' states that whatever Bin a man or a woman may 
have committed from birth, the moment a person takes a bath in 
the holy Puskara all that sin vanishes ,2 " Therefore not only 
men but women also had the right to undertake tirthaystra. 
The Matsyapurana 1378 goes further and asserts that * Avimukta

( Varanasl ) is the highest cure for men of numerous castes, 
for men, not ( recognized as ) belonging to any particular var$a, 
for candalas who are abhorred (by people) and for persons 
whose bodies are full of diseases and of aggravated sins ' It is 
stated in the Vamanapurana : 1279 persons of all the four airamas 
( i. e. brahmacarins, householders, forest hermits and sanwja- 
sins ) by bathing in the tlrtha ( mentioned by it ) save seven 
generations in their families and that persons belonging to the 
four varnas and women," when they bathe in tirthas with 
devotion, see the highest goal. It was provided by the 
BrahmapurSna that a brahmacarui can undertake a pilgrimage 
only if ordered or directed by his guru, and that a householder 
whose wife is alive and is chaste must go on a pilgrimage with 
her; otherwise he would not reap the fruit of pilgrimage The 
Padmapurana ( Bhumikhanda chap. 59-60) narrates fta 
story of a vaisya called Krkala who went on a pilgrimage wifc- 
out his virtuous wife and did not reap the fruits of along 
pilgrimage ( bhary&m vina yo dharmah sa eva viphalo bhavet, 
59 33) The Tirthacintamani and Tirthaprakasa quote a 
passage (from the Kurmapurana) which glorifies Vfflranasl 
(called Avimukta there ) as follows «■ ' brahmanas, ksafcnyas, 
vaisyas, sudras, persons of mixed castes (varnasankara) women 
Xcto and others who are born in evil forms and are of

sudras.' This was explained away by stating that this text 
refers to undertaking pilgrimage without the husband's permis- 
sion (in the case of a woman) and as to a sudra in such a way 
as to be opposed to the primary duty of a Sudra to wait upon 
learned brahmanas (as laid down in Manu X. 133). Katya- 
yana 1282 as quoted in the Vyavaharamayukha provides 'whatever 
a woman does that relates to (benefit in) a future state (i. e. state 
after death) without the permission of her (husband's) father, 
husband or son, would become fruitless ' It is clear therefore 
that it was recognized early that tirtliayati a was a popular way 
for redemption of sins in the case of all classes of men and 
women. Though a Hindu woman succeeding as heir to her 
husband's estate has only a limited and qualified ownership 
over it, judicial decisions have recognized that she can alienate 
a small portion of heT husband's estate for the expenses of a 
pilgrimage to Gaya for performing her husband's sraddha for 
the Matter's spiritual benefit or of a pilgrimage to Pandharpur. 
Vide Muteeiamv. Oopal 11 Beng. L.R. 416; Dorian Lai v. 
Qobmd 46 All. 833; Ganpat v. Tulsiram 36 Bom. 88 (pilgrimage

IV] * Who may resort io pilgrimages 571 

pilgrimage in this world as well as in the next. A person who 
has to undergo an expiation (for a sin), or who is a widower or 
who is a householder of the yayavara 12aa type or similar persons 
may resort to pilgrimages. One may go to holy places with 
his vedic fires or with his wife; he becomes free from all sins 
and secures the hesfc goal as stated above. One who wants to 
go on pilgrimages should pay off the three debts, should provide 
means of maintenance for his sons and should consign his 
wife to their care.' 

Ancient writers on Dharmasastra favoured pilgrimages by 
prescribing, as stated in the Yismi Dh. S , that l289 no money 
was to be demanded from a Vedic student, a forest hermit, an 
ascetic, a pregnant woman and a pilgrim by a ferryman or by 
a toll officer and that if he took money from such persons he 
was to be made to return it. But this prescription was not 
invariably followed even by Hindu Kings The RajataranginI 
(VI 354-255 and "VH. 1008) notices that a tax was levied on 
Kashmirians performing sraddhas at Gaya. 1J% It appears that 
Siddharaja king of Anahilavad (1095-1143 A. D.) levied a tax on 
pilgrims going to Somanatha at the frontier town Banuloda, 
that he remitted the tax at the intercession of his mother and 
that the tax thus remitted amounted to 72 lakhs of rupees every 
year (this last may be an exaggeration to glorify Siddharaja). M90 « 
Moslem kings levied this tax. It appears that a great writer 
called Kavindracarya took up the cause of Hindu pilgrims 
visiting Prayaga and KasI and so eloquently pleaded it before 
Emperor Shah Jeh an that the latter remitted the tax altogether

and conferred upon the great scholar ,ZM the title of 'Sarva- 
vidya-nidhana'. People throughout India felt such relief at the 
remission of the tax that congratulatory letters and addresses 
(several of them couched in very poetic language) poured upon 
KavJndxacarya. These have been published in a work styled 
'Xavlndra-candrodaya' by Dr. Har Dutta Sharma and Mr. 
M. M. Patkar (in the Poona Oriental series), a characteristic 
verse from which is quoted below. 1292 In a remarkable copper- 
plate Inscription in Sanskrit 1253 and Kannada issued by the 
Hoysala king Naraaimha HI in Magha iaJce 1200. (1Z79 A. D) it 
is said that the king granted the revenues (amounting to 645 
mskas a year) of a village called Hebbale to the pilgrims of 
Kasi and to god Srivisvesvara for the purpose of enabling the 
pilgrims to BenaTes (including those from the whole of 
Karnataka, from the countries of Tehngana, Tulu, Tirhufc, 
Gauda and others) to pay off the tax levied by the Turnskas 
(Moslem kings ). W93 

The digests quote certain verses of the Brahmapurana 
about the rites to be performed when a person decides to start 
on a pilgrimage. The Brahmapurana provides that the intend- 
ing pilgrim should restrain his senses the previous day, 
should observe a fast and on the next day he should offer wor- 
ship to Ganesa, the gods, the pitrs and honour good brahmanas

explain that on return there is no fast and no worship of Ganesa. 
He should perform sraddha in which there is plenty of ghee, 
honour three brahmanas (at least) with the offer of sandalwood 
paste &o. and then make a resolve (satikalpci) to go on pilgrim- 
age The V&yupurana 12M and the digests lay down that (after 
the worship of Ganesa, the planets and the deities) he should 
put on the dress of a karpati vie. wear a oopper-ring, a copper 
bracelet and reddish garments. Bhattoji (p 5) states that 
according to some the apparel of karpatika is to he put on by 
a pilgrim going to Gaya. The Padma (IV. 19. 22) prescribes 
the pilgrim's dress for other tirthas also. The TIr. O. adds that 
this dress is to be worn only on the journey to a tirtha, when 
the pilgrim is in a tirtha, but not at the time of performing 
his daily duties such as taking meals (p. 9). 

There is a difference of opinion among the digests as to 
whether tonsure of the head is obligatory when starting on a 
pilgrimage. The Padmapurana 129S and Skandapurana appear 
to make it obligatory. The Tlrtha-Kalpataru does not 1297 refer 
to tonsure at all, while a fast at a tirtha is declared by it to be 
optional. The tendency of later digest-writers is generally to 
make every religious act more elaborate and harder. The 
tonsure of the head and beard was prescribed for a sacrificer

Vedio studenthood (saniavartana) was also marked by tonsure. 1299 
Further, tonsure was prescribed when undergoing prayasoifcta 
for sins (vide p. 123 above). The TIr. 0. and Tlr Pr. both quote 
a verse of Visnu i30o fiom the Smrtisamuccaya, via l atPray3ga,

'On the Ganges, in Bhaskaraksetra, on the death of one's father, 
mother and guru, at the time of consecrating Vedio foes and at 
a soma sacrifice — tonsure ie prescribed in these seven eases. 
Some read 'satsu' and therefore they take the first two words as 
meaning 'on the Ganges only at Prayaga.' Both TIr O. and Tlr. 
Pr, quote a verse 13W which says that tonsure and fast are acts 
that must be done at all tlrthas except at Kuruksetra, Vi&la

in the case of women whose husbandB are living only two finger- 
breadths of hair are out. Vrddha-Harlta (IX. 386-387) lays 
down that in the case of women whose husbands are living 
tonsure of the head should not be carried out, but that holding 
up all their hair only three finger-breadths should be cut off. 
Other smrtis like Apastamba in verse (I. 33-34), Angiras verse 
163, Yama 54-55, Parasiara q. by the Mitaksara on Ysj. HI. 
263-264 lay down that tonsure is limited to the cutting of two 
finger-breadths of hair in the case of woman (nari). Par. 
M. tB ° 2 H 1. p. 291 reads 'evam narlkumarinatn' and holds that 
nan means here 'a woman whose husband is alive'. Although 
the smrti passages occur in the section on prayascitta still by 
analogy they are to be applied to the tonsure in holy places. As 
regards widows, ascetics 1303 and sudras all hair are to be cut. 
The TIrthaprakasa finds fault with Vacaspatimisra for saying 
that there is no tonsure on the Ganges. When, there is such a 
conflict of views, the final decision rests with the usage of each 
country or the individual's choice. The Tir. E. (p 10) appears 
to hold that honouring the pitrs at the time of starting on a 
pilgrimage is specially obligatory on a man with means. The 
texts make a difference between ksaura and mundana. The 
latter means 'shaving the hair on the head as well as the moust- : 
ache and beard,' while ksaura means only shaving the head 
Therefore the Naradlya says that all sages did not prohibit 
ksaura even at Gaya but only mundana is forbidden there ^ 
and there is no mundana on the Ganges anywhere except at 
Prayaga The Tirthendusekhara (p 7) gives it as its opinion 
that tonsure and fast are not obligatory but are only k&mya 
(x e. to be done if certain rewards are desired) and points out 
that sistas do not resort to these two at many tlrfchas

576 History of Dharmaiastra ' { Vol, 

The Puranas and digests devote some attention to the mode 
of travel, The Matsya (106, 4-6) states that 13M if a pilgrim 
goes to Prayaga in a conveyance drawn by bulls he falls into 
hell and his pita do not accept the water offered by him at the 
holy place and if a pilgrim because of riches or avarice or 
foolishness goes in a conveyance (not drawn by bulls) all his 
effort (as a pilgrim) becomes fruitless and therefore a pilgrim 
should avoid journey in a conveyance. According to the 
Kalpataru (on TIrtha p, 11) using a conveyance is forbidden 
only in the case of pilgrimage to Prayaga (and not in the case 
of other tirthas), while the Tlr, C. (p. 8) and Tlr. Pr. (p. 45) 
quote a verse 130s which provides that if a pilgrim uses a cart 
drawn by bulls he is guilty of govadha (killing a oow), if- he 
travels on horse-back (or in a horse-drawn carriage) his 
pilgrimage yields no fruit, if he is carried by men (in a palan- 
quin or the like) he secures only half the merit but if he travels 
bare-footed then he wins the full merit. The Padma-puraiia 
(IV. 19. 27) has a similar verse. The Tlr. Pr. p, 34 quotes a 
verse from the Kurmapurana that those who are unable to 
perform a pilgrimage otherwise do not incur blame (or loss) hj 
making use of a conveyance drawn by men or a chariot which 
is drawn by mules or horses. Similarly, a verse of the 
VisnupurSna mi quoted by both Tlr C and Tlr. Pr. (pp, 34-35) 
provides that one should always go on a journey wearing shoes 
and holding an umbrella in the rains or in summer and armed 
with, a staff at night or m a forest. The Visnudharmottara 
takes a more practical view when it says that to make a pil-

XV] Declaration before starling 5?? 

grimage on foot is the highest tapcis (austerity) and that if a 
pilgrimage he made in a conveyance the pilgrim will reap only 
the reward of the bath. The Tlr. Pr. (p. 35) allows the use of a 
vessel to reach holy places like Gangasagara which cannot he 
reacted otherwise. 

The Tristhall-setu (pp. 1-3) has a long discussion about 
the sankalpa lsn (declaration) to be made at the time of start- 
ing on a pilgrimage. The conclusions reached are that the 
declaration should not include the names of all the holy places 
intended to be visited, but should expressly state the last one 
up to which one desires to go, that persons from southern or 
western India should make a saiikalpa about Gaya (and pilgri- 
mage to Prayaga and KasI will bs implied) and that a person 
from East India should make a saiikalpa about Prayaga (and 
pilgrimage to Gaya and ELasI will be included as a matter of 
course) and that (as an alternative method) a man from south 
or west India should at first make a sankalpa about pilgrimage 
to Prayaga, then while in Prayaga he should make a sankalpa 
about visiting East and then in KasI he should make a 
sankalpa about visiting Gaya. A pilgrim from Eastern India 
should first make a sankalpa about Gaya, then, while in Gaya, 
he should make one about KasI and so on. The Tlrthaprakiisa 
(p. 336) appears to criticize the first method proposed by the 
Tristh3llseta and states its own view to be that those who 
intend to visit many sacred places should make a sankalpa in 
the form T shall perform pilgrimage' (Tirtha-yatramaham 
fcansye). The TErthaprakasa, however, approves of the second 
method proposed as an alternative. 

That the merit of a pilgrimage could be collected in a 
™f^ manner is laid dcwn by the Smrtis and Puranas 
Ata (oO-al) provides «■ < He for whom an effigy made with 
kusa grass intending it as a representative is dipped in the

The PrSyascittatattva of Raghunandana quotes from the 
Brahmandapurana some verses which enumerate fourteen acts 
that a pilgrim has to give up after reaching the Ganges va 
iauea (punctilious performance of bodily purification), acamans 
(sipping water on various occasions in the day), hair (dress- 
ing), wearing mrmalm (flowers taken away after being offered 
in worship), repeating the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg. 190. 1-3), 
shampooing the body, sports, acceptance of gifts, sexual 
dalliance, devotion to another tlrtha, praising another tlrtha, 
the gift to others of clothes (worn by oneself), striking any one 
and swimming across the water of the tirtha. 

One noticeable rule is that, though Mann III, 1A9 leqpirea

IV] Tiriha brahmanas to be preferred 579 

one should not enter upon an examination of the worth of 
brahmanas at holy places and this view is endorsed by seve- 
ral digests such as the Kalpataru on tfttha (p. 10), the Tlr. C. 
(p. 10) and the Tlr, Fr. (p 73). The last work remarks that 
brahmanas who are known for certain to possess defects deser- 
ving condemnation should be avoided. The Varahapurana 
goes 1312 so far as to say that at Mathura a pilgrim should prefer 
to honour a brahmana born and bred up in Mathura rather than 
a brahmana who has studied the four Vedas (but is a stranger 
to Mathura). Similar passages from the Yayu and Skanda- 
purana have been quoted above in note 910 and there is another 
similar passage in Skanda. It is provided by the Vayupurana 1313 
that when a son goes to Gaya, he should invite only those 
brahmanas that have been settled in Gaya by Brahma and that 
such brahmanas are above ordinary mortals, that when they 
are gratified the gods together with one's pttrs become pleased, 
that one should not enter upon a consideration of their family, 
their character, their learning or their austerities and that 
when the Gaya brahmanas are honoured the man doing so secu- 
res release (from samsara). In Vayu 106 73-84 and Agni 114. 
33-39 and Garuda it is narrated that, after Gaygsura fell down 
and asked for boons which were granted by Visnu, Brahma 
bestowed upon the GayS brahmanas 55 villages and Gayatlrtha 
extending over five kroias, gave them well-appointed houses, 
desire-yielding cows and trees, but he enjoined on them not to 
beg or accept a gift from others. The brahmanas, however, 
greedy as they were, officiated at a sacrifice performed by 
Dharma (Tama) and begged him for fees and accepted them. 
Then Brahma cursed them that they would always be in debt 
and took away the Kamadhenu and Kalpavrksa and other gifts 
The Agmpurana «« (114. 37) adds that Brahma cursed them to 
be bereft of all learning and to be full of greed. The brahmanas 
then begged Brahma to favour them with some means of liveli- 
hood (as they had been deprived by the curse of Brahma of all

till the end of the world and that those who would perform 
sraddhaat Gaya and worship them (hy engaging them ns 
officiating priests and pay them) would secure the merit of 
having worshipped Brahma From this it is clear that tho 
Gaya brahman as at the time of the composition of the section 
on Gaya at the end of the Vaynpurana possessed the same 
characteristics as the modern Gaya brahmanas (Gayals or 
Gayawals as they are called } and made the Gaya pilgrimago 
their business even then (as now). One of the early historic 
references to GaySl brahmanas occurs in the Saktipur ooppsr- 
plate of king Laksmanasena of Bengal in his 6th yeaT (i. o. 
about 1183 A D.) 13ls . 

The result of this teaching of the Puranas was that Hio 
brahmanas at Gaya became a guild or a close corporation and 
the Gayawals resent the intrusion of an outsider. Dispute 
between Gayawals and outside priests and cases of GaySnals 
have come before the courts and have gone up even to too 
Privy Council in England. It has been a usage for orthodox 
Hiudu pilgrims going to Gaya to shave themselves at to 
river called Punpun, 13 ' 5 " then on arrival at Gaya to worship 
the feet of one of the Gayawal brahmanas. The Gayawl 
himself or his agent takes the pilgrim to the sacred spols 
(Vedls) in and around Gaya. The priest is pari a fat fee neat 
the Aksaya-vata and the Gayawal puts a garland of flowers 
on the folded hands of the pilgrim and pronounces the word 
wTala' and utters a blessing that the pilgrim s ancestors

their clients, who sign such entries and enjoin upon their des- 
cendants to make members of that particular Gayawal family 
their gurus whenever they might visit Gays. Thus large 
incomes and properties come to the hands of the Gayawals. 
They send their agents throughout India, who hting as many 
pilgrims as possible. In Lachman Lai v. Karilmya Lai the 
Privy 1316 Council had to deal with the case of a Gayawal who 
claimed to be an adopted son without loss of his interest in the 
property of the natural family on the ground of these peculiar 
practices of the Gayawals and that claim was upheld. In 
Lachman Lai v. Baldeo Lai I317 the Patna High Court gives 
a brief summary of the origin, history and customs of the 
Gayawals, remarks that though in former times there were 
several hundred families of Gayawals their number is now 
reduced to about 150, that the Gayawals so-called gaddi is 
not a hereditary office, hut only a business to which a good- 
will is attached. The Calcutta High Court decided in Dwarka- 
nath Misser 131B v. Bampertab Misser that persons who require 
religious ceremonies to be performed for their benefit are at 
liberty to choose the priest by whom they shall be performed 
that plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration that they 
along with defendants are exclusively entitled to officiate as 
priests when pilgrims, on their way to the holy city of Gaya, 
perform the sraddha ceremony of their ancestors on the bank 
of the sacred river Punpun, and that the plaintiffs could be 
given a declaration that they are entitled to officiate as priests 
for such pilgrims as may choose to employ them for the pur- 
pose of religious ceremonies and that the defendants are not 
entitled to prevent the plaintiffs from the exercise of their 
calling InNarayan LA*in T . chulhan lal the Calcutta High 
Court decided how the books containing the names and 
addresses of piterims kept by a joint family of Gayawals were 
to be divided at the tune of the partition of all the properties 
or the family.

few of the Puranas, the Brahraapurana devotes about 6700 
verses (i. e. nearly half of its total extent of 13783 verses) to 
tlrthas, the Padma about 4000 verses out of the 31000 verses 
of the first five khandas, the Varahapur&na devotes about 3183

of about 9614 verses, the Matsya about 1200 verses out of 14002.

The preliminaries before starting on a pilgrimage to any 
ttrtha prescribed by the puranas and digests may be brought 
together. On a certain day ( when a parson has decided on 
ttrtha-yatTS.) he should take only one meal, then the next day 
he should shave himself (according to mo3t digests) and observe 
a fast; then on the day after the fast he should perform his 
daily duties, should make a sankalpa (declaration of intention) 
in the form' I shall perform a pilgrimage to such and such a 
place and I shall worship Ganesa and my favourite deities for 
the accomplishment of the pilgrimage without obstacles' ; offer 
worship to Ganesa, to the planets (nine) and his favourite deities 
with five or sixteen upacaras, 1322 then perform a parvana-sraddha 
with plenty of ghee according to his own grhyas&tra, honour 
three brahmanas at least and donate some money to them. Then 
he should put on a pilgrim's dress as described above (p, 573), go 
round the village in which his house is located (or at least round 
his own house), reach another village not more distant than one 
fcrosa (two or two and half miles ) and break his fast by eating 
the remainder of the food cooked and ghee used for the sraddha 
(this applies to pilgrimage to Gaya). He may break his fast

in his own house (in the case of other tirthas) and then 
start. Then the next day he should bathe with pure clothes 
on and then put on his pilgrim dress and start on his pilgrim- 
age in the forenoon with his face to the east, preferably 
bare-footed. There are two views here. Some say that on the 
day on which a man reaches a tirtha he should observe a fast, 
while the other view is that the pilgrim should fast on the 
day previous to his reaching the tlrtlia. In the first case 
he will have to perform a sraddha on the day of the fast and 
in that case he cannot actually taste the remnants of sraddha 
food but should only smell the cooked food The Kalpataru 
(on tirtha p 11) and the Tirtha-cintamani (p 14) quote Davala 
for the proposition that a fast on reaohing a tirtha is not 
obligatory, but if observed yields special merit. 



CHAPTER XII 
THE GANGES 

Since the Ganges is the holiest of rivers and since such 
highly esteemed tlrthas as Kanakhala, Baridvara, Prayaga 
and KasI are situated on it, it would be most proper to begin 
the treatment of individual tirthas with the Ganges. 

It has been already seen (p. 556) how the Ganges is the first 
among the many rivers invoked in the famous Nadistuli hymn 
(Rg X. 75 5-6). In B-g 1323 VI 45 31 we have the word 'GangyaF 
which most probably means 'grooving on the Ganges'. In the 
Satapatha Brahmana XIII. 5 4 11 and 13 and Ait Br. 39. 9 the 
victories and sacrifices of Bharata Danssanti on the Ganga and 
Yamuna are mentioned. InSat.Br XH 5 4 11 and 13 an ancient 
gutha is quoted ' At Nadapit the Apsaras SakuntalS conceived 
Bharata who after conquering the whole earth brought to Indra 
more than 1000 horses meet for sacrifice.' The Mahabharata 
(AnusSsana 26. 26-103) and the Puranas (such as Naradiya, 
Uttarardha, chap 38-45 and 51. 1-48, Padma V.60. 1-127, 
Agni chap 110, Matsya chap. 180-185, Padma, Adikharida. 
chap 33-37) contain hundreds of verses eulogising the greatness 
and the sanctifying activity of the Ganges. The Skanda*purana, 
Kaslkhanda, chap 29 (verses 17-168) contains one thousand 
names of the Ganges. It is not possible to reproduce here even 
a small fraction of what is said in these works about the 
Ganges To most men in India great rivers like the Ganges 
great mountains like the Himalaya present a double aspect, 
viz the physical aspsct and the spiritual aspect A great 
river apart from its volume of water is deemed to have a spiri- 
tual or divine life which animates it. Tylor (in 'Primitive 
Culture*, 2nd ed.p 477) observes 'What we call inanimate objects- 
rivers, stones, trees, weapons and so forth-are treated as living 
intelligent beings, talked to, propitiated, punished for the harm 
they do.' There are separate treatises devoted to the glorifica- 
tion of the Ganges and the pilgrimage to it such as the

The last pada means 'like a broad patch of grass or bnsh growing on the 
banks of the Ganges '.

of these works. 

The Vanaparva, chap 85, has a grand eulogy of Gaiiga in 
verses 88-97, some of which may he translated here 132 *. "The 
Ganges is equal to Kuruksetra wherever one may take a 
bath in it, hut there is a speciality about Kanakhala and in 
Frayaga there is the greatest and highest (holiness). If a 
person, after committing a hundred bad deeds, sprinkles him- 
self with Ganges (water), the waters of the Ganges barn all 
of them as fire burns fuel. In the Krta age all (places) 
were holy, in Treta age Fuskara was (the holiest place), in 
Dvapara Kuruksetra and in -the Kali age the Ganges. The 
Ganges, when its name is uttered, purifies a sinner, when seen 
it yields good fortune, when a bath is taken in it or its water 
is drunk, it sanctifies the family up to the seventh ancestor. 
As long as (a particle of) the bones of a man touches Ganges 
water (i. e lies inside it), so long does the man remain happy (or 
honoured) in heaven. There is no holy place equal tofi»Gw

even by the performance of hundreds of solemn Vedio 
sacrifices.* 1325 

In the Bhagavadgita (X. 31) Lord Krsna says that among 
streams he is the Ganges (srotasamasmi Jahnavl). The 
Manusmrfci setting out an exordium to a witness to tell the 
truth indicates that the Ganges and Kuruksetra were the most 
sacred spots in the age of the Manusmrti. 1326 Some of the 
Puranas describe the Ganges as flowing in Heaven ( as 
Mandakim^, on the earth (as Gangs) and in the nether regions 
or Patala (as BhogavatI). Vide Padma VL 367. 47. The 
Vismipurana 1327 and other Puranas state that the Ganges 
springs from the toe-nail of the left foot of Visnu. In some 
Puranas it is said that Siva let off from his matted hair the 
Ganges in seven streams, three flowing towards the east 
(Nalinl, Hladini, Pavanl), three to the west (Slta, Gaksus and 
Sindhvi) and Bhaglrathi (vide Matsya lfcl. 38-41, Brahmsnda 
H. 18 39-41, Padma I 3. 65-66). The Karmapurana (1 46.30-31) 
and Varaha (chap. 83 in prose) state that the Ganges flows first 
in four different streams, Slta, Alakananda, Sucaksu and 
Bhadra and that the Alakananda flows towards the south, 
comes to Bharatavarsa and falls into the sea with seven 
mouths "» In the Brahmapurana (73. 68-69) the Ganges is 
described as sprung from the foot of Visnu and as established 
in the matted hair of Mahesvara (Siva). 

The Visnupurana eulogises «» the Ganges as follows : The 
Ganges purifi es all beings from day to day when its name is

heard, when one desires to see (it), when it is seen or touched 
or when its waters are drunk or when one plunge's into it or 
when one takes (or sings) its name; when people ufctor the 
name 'Ganges* even though living at a distance of hundreds of 
yojanas, their sins accumulated in three hirths are destroyed ' 
The Bhavisyapurana 1330 has a similar verse 'one becomes free 
from sins at once by seeing the Ganges or touching it or drink- 
ing its water and by uttering the name Ganga and also by 
remembering iV mi The Mafcsya, Kfirma, Garnda and Padma 
remark that the Ganges is easy of access everywhere but is 
difficult to reach at three places viz at Gangadvara (HandvSra), 
at Prayaga and where it joins the sea and that those who batlio 
therein reach heaven and that those who die there are not born 
again The NaTadiyapurana, on the other hand, says that ttio 
Ganges is difficult of access everywhere, hut much more so at 
three places The man, whether desiring it or nob, who dr<ro? 
near the Ganges and dies (near it) secures heaven and does not 
see hell (Mstsya 107.4). 1332 The Kurmapurana represents that 
the Ganges 1333 is equal to all the 35 millions of holy places 
deolared by VSyu in the heaven, in mid region and on fclm 
earth and that all of them are represented by the Ganges 
The Padmapurana asks 'what is the use of sacrifices rich 
in large wealth, what is the use of very difficult austerities 
when there is the Ganges honoured easily and gracefully 
that yields Heaven and moksa ' ? A similar verse occurs in the 
STradiya-purana 'what is the use of Yoga with it, «ght

on the Ganges alone is superior to all these' i33i . Two verses 
of theMatsya-purana 1335 deserve mention here 'even a man 
of sinful deeds, on remembering the Ganges even , at a dis- 
tance of thousands of yojanas, attains the highest goal. A 
person is delivered from sin by uttering the name (of the 
Ganges ), on seeing it a person sees happiness ; by bathing in 
the Ganges and drinking its water he purifies his family up 
to the seventh ancestor '. It is stated in the Kaslkhanda that 
on the banks of the glorious Ganges all times are auspicious 
as well as all countries, and all men are fit for receiving gifts 

In the Varahapurana (chap. 82) the name 'Ganga' is deri- 
ved as ' gam gata ' (that has gone to the earth). The Padrna- 
puiaua (Srstikhanda 60. 64-65) specifies the mulamanti a about 
the Ganges as follows. 'Om namo Gangayai, visvarupinyai 
narayanyai namo namah'. 

The Fadmapurana (srsti 60 35 ) holds that Visnu repre- 
sents all the gods and the Ganges represents VisDu. It eulo- 
gises the Ganges as follows : Sons abandon their fathers, wives 
their husbands, friends and relatives abandon a friend or a rela- 
tive if any one of these is adulterous, or pattta, or wicked or 
becomes a candala or kills his guru, or is full of all kinds of 
sins and hatreds, but the Ganges does not forsake such 
persons 133s , 

The extent of the holy region of the Ganges is laid 
down in some puranas. The Naradiya 13 " states, the region

within one gavyuti from the banks of the Ganges is called 
ksetra; one should reside within the ksetra limits, but 
not on the bank itself; residence on the bank (of the 
Ganges ) is not desired. The limits of the ksetra are of the 
extent of one yojana between both the banks' i. e. the ksetra 
extends for two krosas from each bank. The general rule is 
stated by Yama that forests, mountains, holy rivers and 
tlrthas are without an owner , these oannot be possessed (by 
a person as owner). The BrahmapurSna 1338 says that measur- 
ing from the flowing waters for a distance of four hastas, God 
Nar&yana is the Lord (or owner) and no one should accept a 
gift in that strip even if he be on the point of death, k differ- 
enoe ia made between the garbha (the inner circle) of the 
Gangaksetra, the tlra and the ksetra. 'Garbha' extends up to 
that portion of the river stream which is reached on the 14th 
of the dark half of Bhadrapada; beyond that is the th-a (bank), 
which extends upto ISO Iwstas from garbha and ksetra extends 
up to two krosas from each bank.

W] Procedure of bath m the Ganges 591 

Matsyapurana 102 is common to people of all varnas and students 
of a]] the different recensions of the Veda. The Matsyapurana, 
chap. 102, which contains one of the earliest procedure of a reli- 
gious bath, and which has heen taken over by several digests 
such as the Gangavakyavall (pp. 148-152) is summarised here. 
Cleanliness (of the body) and clean thoughts do not exist 
without a bath; therefore bathing is first prescribed for making 
the mind pure. One may bathe with water drawn (in a vessel 
from a well or stream) or with water not so drawn. A wise 
man should fix upon a holy spot after repeating the funda- 
mental mantra 'namo Narayanaya' (reverent bow to Narayana), 
A man holding darbha grass in his hand and being clean and 
pure should perform acamana (ceremonial sipping of water). He 
Bhould select a spot four hastas square on all sides and invoke 
the Ganges (to come or be present there) with the following 
mantras 'you are sprung from the foot of Yisnu, you are a 
devotee of Visnu, you worship Yisnu; therefore save us from 
sins committed from birth to death. Vayu declared that there 
are three and a half crores (35 millions) of holy places in 
heaven, on the earth and in mid air; all these, O Ganges 
( daughter of Jahnu), belong to you. Tour name among the 
gods is Nandinl( the joy-giving) and also Nalini and there 
are other names of yours via. Daksa, Prthvl, Vihaga, Visva- 
kaya, Amrta, Siva, Vidyadhari, Suprasanta, Visva-prasadinl 
Ksema, Jahuavl, Santa, S&ntipradayinl. »»»« One should 
utter these holy names at the time of bathing; then the Ganges 
flowing m the three worlds would be near (even if a man bath- 
ed at home ). He should, after folding his hands, cast on his 
head thnce, four times, five times or seven times water on 
which he has muttered the mantras seven times. After having 
invoked he clay ( in the river bed ) with the mantras « earthl 
Oh .c lay! you are crossed over by horses and chariots! by 
Vwm, remove my sin which I may have committed by my 
ml deeds; you were brought up (from the depths of the Z)

prosperity; everything is centered in you; a bow to you, 
that are virtuous and the source of all worlds'. Having 
thus bathed and having sipped water (acamam) according to 
the procedure prescribed, he should' get out of the Ganges 
and should put on two white and pure garments. Then he 
should perform tarpana lm for the satisfaction of the three 
worlds. (He should say) 'This water is being offered by me 
for satiating gods, yaksas, nsgas, grandharvas, apsaTases, 
asuras, cruel snakes, eagles, trees,' jackals, birds, creatures 
that sustain themselves on air and water or that move 
in the sky, all beings that are without support and those 
that are devoted to the dictates of dhaima'. The person 
( performing tarpana ) should wear the sacred thread in the 
Ujpavita form (when satiating gods) and then wear -it in the

"May Sanaka, Sananda and Sanatana, Kapila, Asuri, Vodhu,

grandfather and others in the same way and should recite the 
following mantra 'May those who are my bandhus or not my 
faandhus or were my bandhus in some previous life reach 
satisfaction and also whoever desires satisfaction from me.' 
Then he should sip water (perform acamano) in the prescribed 
way and draw the figure of a lotus in front of himself and offer

IV] Gastmg ashes in the Ganges 595 

-■ashes in the -Ganges occurs in several works. The-AgaipUraffa 
observes 'the deceased man benefits if his hones -are thrown 
into "the Ganges; a man stays in heaven as long as (even a 
particle of) his bone remains in the waters Of the Ganges. 
No rites for the dead are performed for those who commit 
suicide or who are patita; but even in their ease the* fall of 
their bones in Ganges water is beneficial to them.' The TIr. 
and TIr. Pr. quote two verses and a half from the Brahma- 
pur&na m7 which set out a briefer rite of throwing ashes than 
the one in the Nirnayasindhu. The verses mean : "The man 
carrying the ashes should take a bath, sprinkle pancagavya 
over the ashes, should place on them a piece of gold, honey, 
ghee and sesame; then he should deposit them in an earthen 
vessel; he should then look in the southern direction, say 
'salutation to Dharma,* enter the waters (of the Ganges), utter, 
'may he (Dharma or Visnu?) be pleased with me* and then cast 
the ashes in the water; then he should bathe in the river, come 
out of it, cast a look at the Sun and then give a present 
(daksina) to a brahmana; if he does so, then the state of the 
deceased. person will be like Indra.' Vide Skanda, Kssi-khanda 
30. 42-46 where a little more elaborate procedure is prescribed. 
The importance of casting ashes in the Ganges probably owes 
its origin to the story of king Sagara's sons who were reduced 
to ashes by the wrath of the sage Kapila and who were saved 
by the ashes being washed in the waters of the Ganges brought 
down from heaven by Bhaglratha. Vide Vanaparva chap. 107- 
109, VisnupurSna H. 8-10 for the story. The Haradiya makes not 
only the throwing of calcined bones a source of benefit to "the 
departed but even his nails and hair when cast in the Ganges 
confer the same benefit. It is stated in the Kaslkhanda that those 
who, while standing on the banks of the Ganges, praise another 
tlrtha or do not think very highly of the Ganges go to hell »»« 
The Easlkhanda further provides that there is special and

TKISTHALI 

The three great tlrthas of Prayaga, Kasl and Gays are 
referred to as Tristhall and the great scholar, "Sfarayanabhatta 
(born in 1513 &,D.), wrote (about 1580 A.D.) in Benares a 
famous work called Tristhallsetu (a bridge to the Tristhall) 
wherein he gives a thorough and exhaustive treatment of the 
pilgrimage to these three holy places ^s* alone. Prayaga is 
assigned pp. 1-72, Kasl pp. 72-316 and Gays pp. 316-379 {of 
the JLnandasrama edition). Following with all humility the 
footsteps of such an illustrious and venerable scholar I shall 
deal with the three tlrthas in the same order.

,1V] Importance of Prayaga 597 

-twarivers, white and dark, meet together, rise up (fly up) to 
.Heaven; those determined men who abandon their hody there 
(I.e. commit suicide by drowning themselves) secure immor- 
tality (or mdksa)". This must have been a comparatively 
early verse. The Skandapurana referes to it as sruti. The 
greatness of Prayaga is dwelt upon in the Mahabharata (Vana- 
parva 85. 69-97, 87. 18-30, Anusasana 25. 36-38 )«» and in 
many puranas such as the Matsya ( chapters 103-112, in all 
260 verses), Kurma I 36-39 (verses 121), Padma (L chap. 
40-49), Skanda, Kasi-Khanda, chap. 7. 45-65). Only a few 
^out of the hundreds of verses on Prayaga can be cited here by 
way of sample. One remarkable fact is that the Ramayana 
does not say much about Prayaga. The confluence of the two 
rivers is no doubt referred to (Earn. TL 54.6) but from the des- 
cription it appears that there was a forest at what is now 
PraySga. Prayaga is called Tlrtharaja (the prince among 
,tirthas) in the Matsya 109. 15, Skanda (Kasi 7. 45), Padma VI. 
23. 27-35 (where the refrain at the end of each verse is 'sa 
tlrtharajo jayati prayagah) and elsewhere. The legend runs 
that Prajapati or Pitamaha (Brahma) performed a sacrifice here 
and Prayaga is the middle one of the vedls of Brahma, the 
others being Kuruksetra in the north (uttaravedi) and Gays 
in the east. It is believed that three rivers meet at Prayaga 
viz. Ganga, Yamuna and SarasvatI (underground between the 
two). Itis said in the Matsya "si, Kurma and other Puranas 
that at the very sight of Prayaga, even by taking its name or 
by applying its clay to one's body a man becomes free from sin 
The Kiirmapurana* 52 proclaims "it is the sacred spot of 
Prajapati; those who bathe here go to heaven and those who 
die here are not born again." That sacred spot is known as 
tlrtharaja; it is dear to Kesava The same is known as

598 Hislonj of Dharmasastia [Vol, 

The word Prayaga is employed in the neuter when connect- 
ed with such words as tirtha or ksetra, as in Matsya (111 14 
prajapat'er-idam ksetram pTayagaro-iti visratam), but when 
employed along with words (in the masculine gender) such as 
fcirtharaja, it takes the masculine gender. - - 

The word Prayaga is derived in various ways. The Vans- 
parva 1353 appears to suggest that the word'Prayaga is derived 
from the root 'yaj' when it says 'Brahma who is the soul of all 
beings performed formerly a sacrifice here; therefore itheoamc 
known as Prayaga'. In the Skanda 1351 purana also it appears 
to be explained by taking the two paits pra and yoga separate- 
ly. "It is mentioned as Prayaga because it is superior to all 
sacrifices; Prayaga was the name given to it by the godsHari, 
Kara and others seeing that it is superior to all sacrifices 
though the latter be enriched with fees and the like." The 
Matsyapurana 1355 appears to lay emphasis on the part pra' 
when it says 'on account of its efficacy (or power) as compared 
with all other tirthas it prevails (or is useful) far more. The 
Brahmapurana^ affirms "It is called prayaga > on account of 
its eminence and it has the word 'raja' (in Tirtharaja) applied 
to it on account of its being the chief".

IV ] Boundai tes and et-lenl of Pi ayaga 599 

PraySgamandala of five yojanas in circumference. The bound- 
aries of Prayaga itself are defined by Vanaparva, 1358 the Mataya- 
puiana (104 5 and 106. 30) and others. 'Prayaga extends from 
Pratisthana up to the pool of Vasuki and upto the two nagas 
Katnbala and Asvatara and the naga Babumulaka; this is 
known in the three worlds as the sacred spot of Praj&pati' 
(Matsya 104. 5), -while Matsya 106. 30 provides that to the east 
of. the Ganges is the Samudrakupa, which is the same as Prati- 
sthana. This is explained by the Tristhalisetn as follows . the 
eastern boundary is the kupa called Pratisthana ,3S9 ; the nor- 
thern one is the Vasuki pool, the western limit is formed by 
Katnbala and Asvatara , the southern boundary is Babumulaka. 
This would be a four-cornered space which is included within 
Prayaga-mandala. According to the Matsyapurana as quoted 
by the Kalpataru on tirtha p. 143 the two Kagas are on the 
south bank of Yamuna while the printed test has 'vipule 
Yamunatate' (106 27) ww The printed text of Padma 1 43. 
27 supports the Kalpataru reading ( ' Yamuna-daksine tate ) 
Venl-ksetra is within the limits of Prayaga itself and is twenty 
bow lengths in extent, as stated in the Padma. There are 
three kupas viz. Prayaga, Pratisthana and Alarkapura. The 
Matsya and Agni say 'there are three fire knndas and the 
Ganges flows in their midst ' It should be noted that except 
where spacial reference is made in the Puranns to the sub- 
tirthas, the reference to a bath at Prayaga in general means 
bath in the VenI i. e the confluence of the two river3, as e. g

600 History of Dharmaiaatra [Vol, 

The Vanaparva 1362 and some of the Pur5nas represent that 
the country between the Ganges and the Yamuna is (like) the 
hips and loins of the earth (i e. it is the most prosperous and 
plentiful part of the earth ) and that Prayaga is liko the inmost 
part of the hips. 

The Narasimha-pnrana says that Visnu is in the form 
of Yogamurti in Prayaga ( 65 17 ). It is said in the Matsya- 
purana 1363 (111. 4-10) that when Kudra dissolves the world at 
the end of the Kalpa, the holy place of Prayaga is not destroyed, 
that Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara (Siva) stay in Prayaga, 
that to the north of FratisthSna Brahma stays in it tinder guise, 
that Visnu stays there as Veni-Madhava, that Siva stays there as 
the Vata (banyan tree) and that therefore tha gods with the Gan- 
dharvas, the Siddhas and great sages always protect the sphere 
(manoWa) of Prayaga hy guarding it against evil actions. The 
MatsyapurSna, therefore, recommends that a pilgrim should go 
to Prayaga which is protected by all the gods, stay theie for 
a month, avoid sexual intercourse, worship gods and pitrs and 
thereby secure his desired objects (104. 18). The same Futnft 
highly eulogises the gift at Prayaga of a kapilU cow prwrts 
decked (105.16-33) with clothes, ornaments and jewels. The 
Padmapurana (Mi 42 17-34) has the same verses as the Mats,* 
on this subject Similarly, the marriage of a daughter in the 
- f„Jm It PravSga is highly spoken of in Matsya (106. 8-9).

IV] Rewards of gifts at Prayaga 601- 

Kuruksetra, Prayaga, at the mouth of the Ganges where it falls 
into the sea, on the Ganges, at Puskara, at Setubandha, at 
Gangadvara and in Naimisa tends to confer inexhaustible 
rewards. In the Vanaparva 1365 it is stated that this sacrificial 
ground (of Brahma) is honoured even by the gods, that even a 
small thing donated here assumes greatness (i. e. produces the 
rewards of large gifts). 

The confluence of the three rivers came to be associated 
with omfcara, 1366 the mystic syllable that stands for Brahma. 
It is said in a purana passage (probably Brahmapurana) that 
the three parts of om (aura) respectively are SarasvatI, 
Yamuna and Ganga and that the waters of three rivets 
represent Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarsana Hari. 

It may be noted that, in spite of the fact that the 
Matsya, Kfirma (1. 36-39),Padma (3-di chapters 41-49), Agni 111 
and other Puranas contain several hundred verses on Prayaga, 
the Kalpataru (on tirtha), the earliest extant digest on tirthas, 
quotes only the Matsya (104. 1-13 and 16-20, 105. 1-23, 106. 
1-48, 107. 2-31, 108. 3-5, 8-17 and 23-34, 109. 10-12, 110. 1-11, 
111. 8-11, in all about 151 verses) and Vanaparva chap. 85. 
79-87 and 97 and does not add a single word of explanation or 
discussion. But the other digests profusely quoting mostly 
from Puranas discuss at some length several topics and a few 
words must be devoted to some of those topics. 

One such topic is tonsure at Prayaga It is stated by the 
Gangavakyavalt (p. 298) and the Tlr Pr. (p. 335) that, though 
the author of the Kalpataru says nothing about tonsure at 
Prayaga, yet as sistas (respectable and learned pedple) and 
the writers of digests accept it as necessary, certain autho- 
rities would be set out. The two verses quoted by most 13S& * 
writers are 'one should tonsure the head at Prayaga, offer 
pindas at Gaya, make gifts in Kuruksetra and should commit

setra, if one has tonsured one's head at PraySga ? » Elaborate 
discussions are held by all these works about the exact inten- 
tion of the verses, about the application of the maxim of 
ratrtsattra «» to them and about the results derived from ton- 
sure. They have to be passed over here from considerations of 
space. The Tristhali-setu (p. 17) holds that the verse only prai- 
ses the rite of tonsure at Prayaga and the fruit thereof is simply 
the removal of sin. The Tri. S. refutes (p. 17) the application 
of rStnsattra-nyaya to these verses, while Tlr. C {p. 32) applies 
it. Some of the conclusions drawn by the Tri S. are that in one 
and the same yStra at Prayaga (even if a man stays there for 
some days) ceremonial tonsure takes place only once, that 
widows have to tonsure their heads, that in the case of women 
whose husbands are living only two or three finger-breadths of 
tresses are to be cut and offered at the invent, that even 13W « 
boys whose upanayana has not been performed have to undergo 
tonsure provided the c%4a rite has already been performed.

IV] Tonsure of women at Prayaga 603 

relying on passages that aver that all sins oling to the roots of 
a person's hair, say that cutting two or three tresses would be 
merely kartana and not vapana (tonsure), that even women 
whose husbands are alive must shave themselves at Prayaga, 
that such women should make a braid of all their hair, should 
deck the braid with saffron and other auspicious materials, bow 
to their husbands and with the husband's permission have the 
head tonsured, that then they should place the cut hair in their 
joined hands, place thereon a golden or silver venl and pearls 
and coral and should cast all these into the confluence (Venl) of 
the Ganges and Jumns after repeating the mantra 'May all 
my sins be destroyed by this offering of my braided hair into 
the Venl' may my blessedness (the auspicious state of wifehood) 
always increase in the lives to come* The Tri. S. states that 
women do not tonsure their bead at any tirtha except at Prayaga 
and the only reason for this is that it is the practice of sistas. 
Vide above pp 1S2-124 for tonsure as expiation for sins. The 
Naradtya (Uttara) 63. 106 provides the same rule as Parasara 
(in note 278 above) for women. The Prayascittatattva of 
Raghunandana prescribes the complete tonsure of the head for 
women at Prayaga. 

It appears probable that the provision for the casting of 
terii (braided hair) on the part of women whose husbands were 
alive was suggested by the word Yerti applied to the confluence 
of the two rivers, where the river Ganges appears to make a 
bend or curve for some distance. 1369 

One important question that very much exercised the 
minds of ancient and medieval Indian writers was whether and 
when suicide, particularly at sacred spots like the confluence 
of the Ganges and Jumna or at the foot of the Aksaya Vata at 
Prayaga, would involve no sin.*»o This m atter has already been

604 History of Dharmaiaslra [VoJ. 

dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol H. pp 921-928 and vol TH 
pp. 939, 948-949. Only a brief treatment by way of a summary 
of the pages and a few notes will be added here. The general 
sentiment of Dharniasastra works is to condemn suicide or an 
attempt to commit suicide as a great sin (viae H of Dh vol H 
page 924 for texts). The lp. Dh. S. (L 10 28 15-17) mentions 
the view of Harlta which condemns suicide even as praya- 
scitta for committing a mahapataka (like incest) and puts kill- 
ing another or killing oneself on the same footing ManuV. 
89 and Yaj. HI, 154 condemn suicide by denying after-death 
rites to those who commit it, but Manu allowed suicide in 
various ways as prayascitta for mahapatakas (vide Manu XL 
73, 90-91, 103-104). But exceptions to the condemnation of 
suicide are found in the smrtis, epics and puranas. They may 
be grouped under several heads. (1) Suicide as an exception 
in various ways by those guilty of mahapatakas (viz. brahmana 
murder, drinking of su?a, theft of brahmana's gold ana incest) , 
vide H. of Dh. voL H pp. 924-925 for smrti and other teste.

Suicide at Piayaga 6 05 



young ohild or young children, if she is pregnant or if she has 
not attained puberty, or if she is in her monthly illness , 
at the time. Not only did common men believe m the pro. 
raise of the Puranas that those who killed themselves at 
Prayaga (at the sangama or near Vata) secured moksa 
(freedom from the everlasting cycle of births and deaths) 
which was the highest of the four pitrusarathas (goals 
of human existence), but even great poets like Kalidasa 
held the view that, though moksa or luuialya or apavarga 
requires correct knowledge and realisation of the Supreme 
Spirit according to the Vedanta, Sankhya and Nyaya systems, 
death at the sacred sangama led to moksa even without 
'tattvajnana.' In H. of Db. vol. II pp. 935-937, historical ex- 
amples of kings such as Yasah-karnadeva, Oandella Dhangadev 
and Galukya Somesvara committing suicide at Prayaga or the 
Tungabhadra have been given. The king Kumaragupta of 
Magadha is said to have entered the fire of dry cow-dung cakes. 
This is in accordance with the prescriptions in the Matsya- 
purana 107. 9-10 (=Padma, £di-khanda 44 3) which states. 1372 
'the man who, suffering from no diseases, having no deficiency 
as to his limbs and being in full possession of his five senses, 
encompasses (his death) in cowdung fire remains honoured in 
heaven for as many years as there are pores on the whole of his 
body.* 1373 The Rajataranginl VI 14 refers to officers entrusted 
with the duty of supervising suicide by fast (prayopavesa).

of the following as the meritorious kinds of suicide (vol I. p. 531 and p. 802 
of the Popular edition, edited by J. Muihopadhyaya). These are five in 
number viz. (1) starving; (2) covering himself with cowdung and setting it on 
fire and consuming iimself therein, (3) burying himself in snow; (4) to 
plunge into water at the GangSsSgara-sangaina, enumerate one's sins and 
pray tilt alligators come and devour the man, (S) cut his throat at Allahabad 
at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna. 



606 Histovu of DIuxrmaiasba [Vol 

The important verse on which reliance is placed for 
sanctioning religions suicide at Prayaga may be translated' 137 * 
as follows. 'You should not set aside (pass over) your wish 
about dying at Prayaga on account of the words of the Veda or 
the words of the people.' The words of the Veda 1375 are Taj. S, 40 
3 (=Isav5syopanisad 3) which literally translated means 'there 
are worlds of Asuras enveloped in blinding darkness, those 
who have killed themselves repair after death to those worlds * 
This verse does not in the context appear to refer to a person 
committing suicide, but rather to a person who kills his soul 
by remaining in ignorance of the true Self. But even learned 
writeiB and poets took it to refer to 8uicide(vide Uttara- 
ramacarita, A-ct IV after verse 3). Another passage of the Veda 
on which reliance may he placed is the one in the Satapatha 
Brahmana X. %. 6. 7 'one ought not to yield to his own desire 
and pass away before the full extent of life, for it (such 
shortening of full life) does not make for the (heavenly) world' 
By 'the words of the people' are meant smrti passages con- 
demning suicide such as Quit. U. 12, Vas««» 33 . u-15, Maim 
V 88 (which says that no water is to be offered to those who 
kill themselves), Visnu Ph S U. 56 (atniatyaginah paiMfei

Smcide at Prayaga 6 °7 



There is no doubt that some of the star lis, the Maba- 
bharata 1376 itself and some puranas do recommend (or at least 
do not condemn) suicide in certain circumstances. Afew 
purana passages may be quoted here. Two verses of the Kurma 
state 'That goal (or state), which a wise man that is devoted 
to Yoga and that has become an»ascetic (or has forsaken all 
actions) reaches, is secured by him who gives up life at the 
confluence of the Ganga and Yamuna. Whoever dies in the 
Ganga whethei wilfully or unintentionally is born after death 
in heaven and does not see heir. 13 " The Kurma is quite clear 
'Moksamay be secured or not after a thousand births else- 
where but in Benares moksa can be secured in a single birth' 
(1. 32. 22) The Padma 1378 is quite emphatic 'a man who, 
knowingly or unknowingly, wilfully or unintentionally, dies in 
the Ganges secures on death heaven and 'moksa'. A verse of 
the Skanda asserts 'He who abandons his life in this sacred 
place in some way or other does not incur the sin of suicide 
but secures his desired objects.' The Kurma (T. 38 3-12) refers 
to four modes of suicide and promises residence in heaven and 
various other rewards for thousands of years, viz. by (1) burn- 
ing oneself in the slow fire of dry cowdung cakes, (2) by enter- 
ing the water at the confluence of Gahga and Yamuna, (3) by 
hanging with head down in the stream and feet up and drinking 

1376. Vide the references given under No. 2 and 3 of the five classes of 
excusable or permitted suicides on p. 604 above. The Mahabharata has a 
paroa called Mahaprasthamta in -which it is narrated (chap 1. 24) that 
Yndhisthira with his four brothers, qneen Draupadt and a faithful dog 
started on the Great Journey towards the Himalaya and that they fell down 
dead one after another, Draupadt being the first and Bhima the last.

ingr heaven and jm**, by committing suicide at Prayaga or- 
Bonfires appears to have spread to other tirthas. VanaparoW 9 
speaks of suicide at Prttmdaka (Pehova in theKarnal district 
of Punjab, 14 miles from Thanesar) TheBrahmapurana"® 
calls upon dvijas who are intent on securing moksa to commit 
suicide at Purusottama-kgefcra. The Lingaparanawn sayS ',f 
a brShmana kills himself on Srlsaila he destroys his sins and 
attains moksa as at Avimukta (Benares); there is no doubt 
about this'. The Padma promises «» a similar reward for 
suicide by fire or by fast at the confluence of NarmadS and 
Kami (a small river, not the great South Indian river). 

Gradually there was a revulsion of feeling against suicide 
at Prayaga or Kasi or starting on the Great Journey. Among 
the actions forbidden in the Kali age are included 'starting 
on the Great Journey* and 'suicide of old people jumping 
from a precipice or by fixe' (vide H. of Dh, vol. IE pp. 939, 
958-59 ). Some of the later medieval writers try very hard 
to combat the view that religious suicide is permitted 1383 . 
Nflakantha, the commentator of the Mahsbharata, holds that 
VanapaTva 85. 83 (na vedavacanat &c ) refers to natural death 
at Prayaga and not to wilful death and that the Khiia verse 
('Sitasite' quoted above on p. 596) has the same meaning. Then 
he propounds two alternative interpretations of Yanaparra 85.

83, viz. that this passage allows those who are suffering from an 
incurable disease to commit suicide at Prayaga instead of dying 
by falling from a precipice and the like or that this verse does 
not apply to brahmanas but only to the other three varnas. 138i 

Both the GangaVakyavall (pp. 304-310) and the T5t. O 
(pp. 47-52) hold that all varnas have the authority to resort to 
suicide at Prayaga. The Tir. Pr holds a long, learned and 
highly polemic discussion on the subject of religious suicide at 
Prayaga (pp. 346-355). Its own view appears to be that a 
brahmana should not commit this suicide at Prayaga on 
account of the prohibition contained in Kalivarjya verses and 
that members of the other varnas may do so. The Tristhalisetu 
also enters upon a long discussion (pp. 47-55) and its conclu- 
sions are that in suicide at Prayaga for the attainment of 
moksa or other rewards (such as heaven) there is no sin, that 
this suicide at Prayaga is not forbidden 138 *" to brahmanas as 
some think (since Agni 111 8 reads *na vedavacanad vipia'), 
that persons whether seriously ill or in good health 1383 may 
resort to suicide at Prayaga, that no one has authority to 
commit suicide at Prayaga after abandoning to their fate one's 
old parents, young wife and children that require support, nor 
should a woman who is pregnant or who has young children or 
who has no permission from her husband, commit suicide at

the most learned and renowned Pandit of his age steeped in all 
the lore of ancient India, make, in spite of the overwhelming 
weight of sastric authority in favour of suicide at Prayaga, 
exceptions that surely appeal to reason, sentiment and common 
sense. 1387 N§rayanabhatta probably followed traditions several 
hundred years older than his times. Alberuni in his work on 
India composed about 1030 A D. says about religious suicide 
that 'it was resorted to by those who are tired of life, who 
are distressed over some incurable disease, some irremovable 
bodily defect or old age or infirmity. This however no man of 
distinction does, but only vaisyas and sudras. Burning oneself 
is forbidden to brahmauas and ksatriyas by a special law. 
Therefore these if they want to kill themselves do so at the 
time of an Bchpse in some other manner or they hire somebody 
to drown them in the Ganges.' (tr. by Saohau, vol. H. p 170). 
The Tri. S. S. provides that a man desirous of committing 
religious suicide at Prayaga should first perform a prayaseitta,

should perform his own sraddha upto the offering of pinda if he 
has no relative entitled to perform it, should fast that day, 
should make a sankalpa next day preceded by a writing (to 
inform people of his desire to die in that way) and enter the 
holy waters contemplating on "Visnu. On his death, his 
relatives have to observe ssauca only for three days (and not 
for ten) and on the 4th day the sraddhas of the 11th day are 
to be performed for him. 1388 

The psychological background behind the religious suicide 
at Prayaga and other places is not difficult to realise. 
Centuries of philosophical thought had made a very deep 
impression on the minds of all people that the soul has to 
submit to a never-ending cycle of births and deaths. Ancient 
scriptures had offered a release in two ways viz. by tattvajilana 
and by suicide at a tlrtha. Death had no great terror for the 
pilgrim who submitted to various inconveniences and priva- 
tions ungrudgingly. If one is determined to put an end to 
samsam by taking one's life, what nobler environment could 
have been imagined or indicated than at Prayaga, where two 
mighty rivers flowing from the sacred Himalaya unite and carry 
on unceasingly their work of fertilizing the land and bringing 
prosperity and solace to millions of needy and anxious people * 

While on this topic of religious suicide, it would not be out 
of place to briefly refer to the discussion in the digests about 
the meaning of the statement in the purSnas that those who die 
at Prayaga are not born again (e. g. Matsya 180. 71 and 74). 
The answer is foreshadowed in the Matsyapurana itself (183, 
22-25) which >:» say s; At the time of death, when the vital

parts of the human body are being shattered, memory must fail 
a human being that is about to be pushed on (to another body) 
by the vital breath (when it leaves the mortal coil). But at the 
time of death in Avinmkta (VaranasI) Lord (Siva) himself 
whispeTS (higher knowledge) in the ears of his devotees that 
are about to be pushed (into new bodies) by (accumulations of 
their actions). A. man dying near Mamkarnita pool reaches 
the desired goal; he being guided hy the Lord reaches the goal 
which is difficult of attainment by those whose minds are not 
pure.' In the Kaslkhanda it is expressly stated that moksa does 
not directly result in these cities (viz. Kssl &c ). But in spite of 
these warnings the popular belief fostered by the literal mean- 
ing of hundreds of Purana passages is that mokss results from 
dying at PraySga or in Easlfcsetra. 

The practice of religious suicide has a very respectable 
antiquity. In the 4th century B. C. Kalanos, the Mian 
Gymnosophist from Taxila who had accompanied Alexander 
from India, burnt himself alive on a funeral pyre at Sonsa, 
when being over 70 years old, he was afflicted with a malady 
that made life more and more burdensome. Vide J_W 
McCrindle's 'Invasion of India by Alexander the Great (Sew 
Edition 1896) pp. 46, 301, 386-39*. Strabo informs us of * 
gymnosophist from India named Zarmanochegas ^ Broach who 
accompanied an embassy to Augustus Caesar at A hens and 
oonsianed himself to flames (nde 'Invasion of Into by 
XfnX' P 389). Hiouen Thsang (BeaVs 'Buddhist Becords

operate by giving the soul the present body) and knyamana (to 
be done in this body and in future). The TJpanisads -and the 
Glta 1391 declare that, just as waters do not stiok to a lotus leaf, 
so evil deeds do not oling to a man who knows this (knowledge 
of brahma), that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all 
larma and that moksa results from the realization of the 
Supreme Spirit ( Vedanta-sutra IV. 1. 13 ). From this it 
follows that a man who has realized the Highest Reality 
will not be affected by the acts done by him after realiza- 
tion and his accumulated actions (sancita) will he des- 
troyed by that realization. The present body in which the 
soul realizes brahma waB due to that part of his Jcarma which 
had begun to operate. When the present body perishes in the 
case of a man who nas realized brahtna he attains final release, 
since no actions remain for producing effects. To the man who 
dies a natural death in Benares is given at the time of death 
the Taraka (saving) mantra The Matsyapurana says: 1392 
those who enter fire according to the rules in Avimukta (i. e. 
Benares) enter the mouth of Siva and so also those determined 
devotees of Siva who die by fast in Benares do not return (to 
this world) even after millions of kalpas. Therefore all those 
who die in any way at 1393 Benaies receive Grace from Sjva 
after their death That leads to tattvajfiana (correct spiritual 
knowledge) which leads to moksa In rare passages it is 
expressly stated that moksa cannot 13 » be immediately secured

(by dying) in these cities. The Taraka-mantra is variously 
explained. According to Suresvara, Tsraka-mantra is the 
mystic syllable om which is a symbol of brahma as stated in 
tho Tai. Up. (I. 1 .8 Om-tti brahma) and the Gifca (8. 13 Om- 
ityekaksaratn brahma). The Tri. S. gives another explanation 
beBides this. According to Eamatapanlya Upanisad and 1395 
the Padmapurana the mantra is 'srl-Rama-Eama-Eameti.' 

There are several sub-tirthas that fall under Prayaga The 
most important of them iB the famous Vata (banyan tree) oalled 
Aksaya-Vata (the imperishable Vata). The Agni (111. 13) states 
'if a man dies at the foot of the Vata and in the Sangama he goes 
to the city of Visnu\ Special reference is made to abandoning 
one's life at the foot of the Vata. The Kurma 1396 says 'He, who 
abandons life at the foot of tho Vata, passes beyond heavenly 
worlds and goes to the world of Eudra'. The following are the sub- 
tlrthas of Prayaga and only references are given to the works in 
whioh they are described : (1) the two Nsgas oalled Kambala and 
AsvataTo. which according to some are on the spaoious (vipula) 
hank of the Jumna and according to others on the southern bank 
of the Jumna (Vanaparva 85 77, Matsya 106. 27, Padma, Aii 39 
G9, Agni HI. 5, Karma I. 37. 19), (2) Pratisthana on the eastern 
side of tho Ganges, being the same as the Samudra-kupa (Vana-

company of sages, when he comes down from heaven he 
becomes ,the lord of Jambudvlpa. 

1 . At most famous tirthas the pilgrim has to perform sraddha. 
The Visnu J)h. S. (chap 85) mentions about fifty-five sacred 
places which'are fittest for sraddha The Kalpataru (on tlrtha), 
the Gangavakysvall, T!r, C. and other digests quote several 
verses from the Devlpurana, the gist of which is as follows 
Sraddha should be performed at tirthas, but there is no offering 
of aighya and no Soahana (since pitrs are deemed to be always 
present at tirthas, as the Kasikhanda says) nor is the entering of 
the thumb of the invited brShmana into the food served done, 
nor is there the question about the brahmanas being satiated, nor 
biktra un If one is unable to follow the complete procedure of 
sraddha one should merely offer pindas made from barley meal 
or may offer saihyaba (cake of wheat flour fried with ghee and 
milk), rice boiled in milk, the cake of sesame (after the oil is 
extracted) or jaggery li0i It should not be allowed to be seen 
by dogs, crows and vultures, it may be offered at any time after 
the pilgrim reaches the holy place A sraddha performed at a 
holy place gives great satisfaction to pitrs. Some of the 
works such as the TristhalisetusSrasangraha of Bhattoji provide 
that after performing a parvanasraddha at a tirtha and after 
makins offerings of pindas to one's ancestors one should offer a 
ain-le pwdato one's other relatives with the following mantra 
'.Sere I offer pinda to deceased persons of my fathers family, 
<u,d of my mother's family and to the deceased relatives of

who were devoid of sons or wives and so who wonld lose the 
benefit of the pinda (to be offered by the son or wife) and in 
the case of whom all rites after death have oeased, those who 
were blind from birth or were cripples, those who were mal- 
formed or died in the womb; to all these, whether known 
or unknown to me, may this (pinda) reach inexhaustively' 1 
( Vayu 110. 51-52). After this he should offer another pinda 
for his servants, slaves, friends, dependents, pupils, persons 
who conferred obligations on him, cattle, trees and those with 
whom he oame in contact in other lives (Vayu 110. 54-55). If a 
person is ill or has not the time to go through this elaborate pro- 
cedure, then he should make a sankalpa that he would perform 
sraddha and should offer a single pinda with the mantra (in 
Vayu 110 33-24) 'I offer this pinda to my father, grand-father, 
great-grand-father, to my mother, father's mother, grandfather's 
mother, to my maternal grandfather and to the latter's father 
and grandfather. May it reach tham inexhaustively ' 1 

The Anusasana-parva, the Kurmapurana, Haradlya 
(uttara) 63. 19-30 and 36-38 and others highly praise bathing 
at the sangama in the month of Magha 14ra . Men of all castes, 
women and those born of mixed unions can take this bath; 
sudras, women and men of mixed castes should not repeat any 
mantra but should bathe silently or with the word 'namah' 
(Tri. S. p 39). Similarly, the Padma^ Kurma, Agni and other 
Puranas wax eloquent over a hath for three days in Magha 
saying that it is equal to the gift of three crores of cows ""* 
There is great divergence as to exactly what three days' are

K5SI 

-There is hardly any city in the world that oaa olaim 

greater antiquity, greater continuity and greater popular 

veneration than Banaras. Banaras has been a holy city for at 

least thirty centuries. No city in India arouses the religious 

emotions of Hindus as muoh as KasI does. To the Hindu 

mind it represents great and unbroken traditions of religious 

sanctity and learning. It is a miniature of Hindu life through 

the ages in all its great complexities and contradictions. Not 

only Hinduism with its numerous sects has flourished here for 

numberless centuries, but the principles of Buddhism, one of the 

great religions of the world, were first proclaimed hereby 

Sakyamuni after he received Enlightenment at Bodh-Gaya 

under the Bodhi tree. Thousands of verses are found in the 

epics and puranas about Banaras. Several volumes have been 

written about Banares during the last hundred years. 1 * 05 It 

would be impossible to do justice here to this vast mass o 

literature on Banaras I shall briefly deal with the importan 

topics relating to Banaras. In olden times the name was spelt 

as Benares, but recently as Banaras, which will be retained 

here (except in quotations). 

Before proceeding further, it is necessary to dwell, bovver 
briefly, on the ancient history of Banaras The Satapatha , Br.

XV] Ancient Instonj of Kasi 619 

Cambridge History of India (vol. L p. 117 ) remarks that m the 
Brahmana period Kasi, the capital of the Kasis, was situated 
on the Yaranavatl. In the Br. Up. (II. 1. 1) and the Kausltaki wos 
Up. (IV. 1 ) there is the story of the proud Balaki Gargya going 
to A)atasatru, king of Kasi, with the assurance that the former 
would expound brahma to the latter. In Panini IV. 2. 116 Kail 
heads a gana (Kasyadibhyas-than-ithau'). Under Panini IV. 2. 
113 we get the form 'Kaslyah.' It is remarkable that in the 
Sarvanukrama the rsi of Kg. X 179. 2 is stated to be Pratardana 
Kasiraja. In tarpana, the Hir. Gr. (XL 8. 19.6) mentions Kasl- 
svara along with Visnu and Rudraskanda (S. B. E. vol 30 p. 
244). Divodasa figures frequently in the Kgveda. In Kg I 
130 7 Indra is said to have conquered ninety cities for Divodasa, 
while in Kg. IV. 30. 20 it is stated that Indra gave 100 cities of 
stone to Divodasa. From these Vedic references it may be 
surmised that in later works like the Epics and the PurSnas 
Divodasa was naturally credited with the founding of the most 
sacred city in India. In the Mahabhasya on Vartika 4 on Pan. 
IV. 1. 54 (vol II. p 223) we find the illustration 'Kasi-Kosallyah.* 
The Mahabhasya (vol, IL p 413) furnishes the interesting 
information that there is a difference in the price of cloth 
manufactured at Kasi and that manufactured at MathurS, 
though the length and breadth of the piece of cloth be the same. 
This shows that even so early as the 2nd century B. O. Kasi 
was famous for the fine qualities of its cloth, as now. 1409 From 
the above passages it is clear that Kasi was the name of a 
country long before the Satapatha Br. was composed and it 
remained so till the 2nd century B. C. ( the date of Patafi3ali). 
We have a parallel example. Avanti is the name of a country 
as shown by Pan IV. 1. 176 (striyam-avanti-kunti-kurubhyas-ca) 
and by the Meghaduta (Prapyavantin-udayana — ), but Avanti 
or Avantika is also the name of Ujjayinl (as in the well-known 
verse * Ay odhy 5... Avantika*). Fa Hien (399 to 413 A.D.)is 
Baid to have arrived at the city of VaranasI in the kingdom 
of Kasi (Legge's tr. p 94). This shows that about 400 A. D. 
Kasi was still the name of the district and VaranasI was its 
capital But from the reference in the Mahabhasya it appears 
that Kasi had then become the name of the city (and was also

the namo of the country) In the AnusaSana-paiva (chap 30) 
it IB said that Haryasva, the grand-father of Divodasa, was 
king of the Kassis 14W » and was harassed and killed by the 
Vitahavyas in the Daub between the Ganges and Jumna. 
Haryasva's son was Sudeva who was crowned king of Kasi 
(verse 13, Kasirajos bhyasicyata) and he also met the same fate 
as his father did. Then Divodasa, son of Sndeva, became king 
of the Easis and founded Varan asi thickly populated with men 
of all varnas on the northern hank of the Gomafcl. This legend 
shows that EasI was the ancient name of a kingdom and the 
ancient belief was that Varanasi was founded as the capital of 
the Easis by Divodlsa. In the Udyogaparva also Divodasa is 
said to be the ruler of Kasis. 1 * 10 

The Harivamsa (I chap. 29) has a long but rather confused 
story about Divodasa and VaranasI 1 "' It deals with the 
dynasty of JLyus, one of the sons of Aila. One of the descen- 
dants of Ayus was Sunabotra who had three sons, Easa, Sala 
and Grtsamada ITrom Easa arose a branch called Easayab. 
Dhanvantari, a descendant of ESsa, was king of the Essis 
(verse 22). Divodasa was great-grandson of Dhanvantari. He 
killed 100 sons of Bhadrasrenya, who first was Lord of 
Varanasl. Then Siva sent his gam tfikumbba to destroy 
Vatanasl which.had been occupied by Divodasa. Nikombha 
cursed it to be devastated for a thousand years When it 
became devastated it came to be called Avimukta and Siva 
resided there B was again re-established (verse 58) by

IV] Ancient history of Vaianasi 621 

In the Mahabhgsya Patafijali states (vol. I. p. 380,) that 
VaranasI is alongside of Ganga and on Pan. IV. 3. 84 (vol. IX 
p. 313) he informs us that traders call Var&nasl Jifcvarl. 

Anoient Buddhist works show that Banaras was, in the 
times of Buddha (5th Century B O. at the latest), a great and 
famous city like CampS, Rasagrha, SravastI, Saketa and 
Kausambl (vide Mahaparmibbanasutta, S. B. B. vol. XI p 99 
and Mahasudassanasutta, ibid. p. 247), The very fact that 
Buddha attained Enlightenment at Gaya (which was an out of 
the way place and on the borders, if at all, of .. Aryavarta), 
thought it necessary to trave] hundreds of miles from Gaya and 
preach his doctrines at Banaras in the Deer-park and set roll- 
ing the wheel of the kingdom of Dharma at that place, clearly 
indicates that Banaras had then become a very holy place and 
was in the centre of all Aryan activities and culture (vide 
S. B. E, vol. XL p. 153 and vol. XIII p 90, Mahavagga, S. B. E. 
vol. 17 p. %\). King Brahmadatta of Banaras figures in many 
jataka stories. Hardly any part of the jtitaka, tales can be placed 
earlier than the 3rd century B. O. But it may be admitted that 
Banaras was well-known as the capital of Brahmadatta kings 
several centuries before Christ. The Matsyapurana 273, while 
enumerating hundreds of kings bearing the same surnames 
states that there were 100 Brahmadattas and 100 Kasis and' 
Kusas 1412 But the very fact that Brahmadattas are separately 
mentioned from the Kasis largely reduces the value of this 
piece of information. The ancient Jain works also speak of 
Banaras and Kasl. In the Kalpasutra it is said that Arhat 
Parsva was born in Banaras in the month of Caitra on the 4th 
day of the dark fortnight (S B. E. vol. XXII p. 371) and that 
when Mahavira died the 18 confederate kings of Kasi and 
Kosala along with other kings of the Licohavis and Mallakis 
instituted an illumination on the day of the New Moon (ibid 
p. 266). Asvaghosa appears to identify VaranasI with Kasi 
when he says in his Buddhacarifea 'Having entered VaranasI 
the Jma (Buddha) illumining the city with his light filled" the 
minds of all the inhabitants of Kasl with excessive interest '«» 
The Buddfaacarita further speaks of Buddha as having eona 
under the shadow of a tree near Vanara (S. B. E. vol. 49 part 1 p,

169), which is probably the Varana. It is thus clear that VaranasI 
and Kail had become synonyms at least sometime about the first 
century A. D, In the Vayupursna 45. 110 KBh-Jcoialah figure 
among the countries of Madhyadesa. 

In the Visnupurana we have the story of Paundraka 
Vasudeva who challenged Krsna and asked the latter to surren- 
der his Oalcra and other symbols He was helped by the king 
of Kail. The combined armies of Paurjdraka andKasIraja 
attacked Krsna who killed Paundraka and cut off Kaslraja's 
head (with his discus) which fell in the city of KasI, His son 
performed austerities, propitiated Sankara and secured from 
him a Krtya (ogress) which entered VaranasI. Krsna's discus 
in pursuit of her burnt the whole of Yaranasi together with its 
king, his servants and citizens In this account from the 
Visnupurana (V 34) the names Kasi, VarSnasi and Avimukta 
are employed as synonyms (verses 14, 31, 25, 30, 39). The same 
legend occurs in the same words in Brahmapurana, chap 207 
and is briefly referred to in Sabhaparva, chap. 14 18-20 and 
chap. 34. 11. 

From the above-mentioned accounts in the Epic andPurgnas 
about KasI and Mahsdeva, various conclusions 1 * 1 * have been 
drawn by writers, viz. that Mahadeva was a god of the non- 
Aryans, that Banaras was a centre of non-Aryan worship for a 
itng time after the advent of the Aryans and hat the people 
S lanLras though they ultimately turned to the Aryan religion.

IV ] Conclusions from legends about Bamras 623 

legends contained in the puranas weie meant for the entertain- 
ment of common people, just as even in these days millions iu 
Western countries read with relish detective stories and crime 
club fiction. Some paiiranic legends had a serious purpose in 
view viz emphasizing religious or philosophical dogma or moral 
values and standards and were clothed in a supernatural garb to 
make them striking and effective. Only a few legends have 
some historical basis, but the latter is evidently smothered 
in a mass of exaggerations and prejudices for or against a hero, 
or a caste, class, tribe or family. It is hardly fair to draw far- 
reaching historical conclusions from heterogeneous materials in 
the puranas about the conditions of things that prevailed several 
hundreds or thousands of years before they were compiled. 
The puranas often speak of the quarrels and bickerings among 
high gods and sages Inr example, the Visnnpraana V. 30. 65 
speaks of a fight between Indra and Ersna. Was Krsna a non- 
Aiyan god originally' Ganesa's left tooth was shattered by 
the missile of Parasurama who comes to fight with Rama, both 
being supposed to be avataras of Visnu. The sage Bhrgu curses 
Visuu, Gautama curses Indra, Mandavya curses Dharma (vide 
for all these, Brahmanda D, E7. ai-85). 

In several purgnas Easi or Varanasi has been lauded and 
described at great length. Vide Matsya 180-185 ( 411 verses ), 
Kurma 1.31-35 ( verses 226 ), Lingapurana ( purvabhaga, chap' 
93, verses 190 ), Padma ( Adikhanda 33-37, verses 170 ) Agni 
112, Skanda, Easlkbanda, chap 6 ff, Haradlya ( uttara, 
chap. 48-51). The Kaslkhanda alone has about 15000 verses 14 " 
on Banaras and its Bub-tirthas. In the Padmapursna the sages 
are said to have asked Bhrgu five questions, viz what is the 
greatness of KasI, how it is to be understood, who should 
resort to it what is its extent ( or boundaries ) and by what 
means it (Kasl) can be secured. In the Bkandapurana,

Banaras has been known for centuries under five different 
names viz. VaranasI, Kasi, Avimukta, Anandakanana and

IV ] TJie derivation of the word Kail 625 

A few words must be said about the derivation and significance 
of these woids as gathered from the Puranas and other works. 
And first comes Kasi. It is derived from the root hai ' to shine.' 
The Skandapur&na utt says that the city of Kasi became famous 
by that name because it sheds light on (the way to) nirvana 
(final release) or because that indescribable refulgence, viz. God 
Siva shines forth there. The name Varanasi is derived in several 
Puranas from the names of two streams Varana M19 ( modern 
Barna) and Asi, which are respectively the northern and 
southern boundaries of the modern city. From the passages 
quoted below from the Skandapurana ( Kasi-khanda ) it appears 
that Asi is the correct form oF the name of the river. The 
names most frequently used in the Puranas are Varanasi and 
Avimukta. In the Jabalopanisad "» the words Avimukts, 
Varana and Nasi are brought together m an esoteric sense! 
"Atri asked YajBavalkya: how is one to know the unmanifested 
Self ? Yajfiavalkya explained that he was to he worshipped in 
Avimukta, since the self is centered in Avimukta Then a 
question was asked: in what is Avimukta centered or 
established ? The reply is that Avimukta is established in the 
midst of Varana and Nasi. Varana is so called because it

wards off all faults due to the senses and Nasi destroys all sins 
due to the senses. Then a question is asked, what is its loca- 
tion ( sthana ) ? The reply is that it is the conjunction of the 
eyebrows and the nose i. e. theupasana (contemplation) of 
Avimukfca is to be made as located in the span between tho 
eyebrows and the root of the nose." Here it will be seen that 
Varana and Nasi are the names { and not Varans and Asi }. 
The Vamanapurana employs the form As! (15.50-53). Tho 
same is the case with the Padma. 

The name Avimukta has generally been explained as 
derived from the negative particle 'na' (for which *a' is substi- 
tuted) and vimukta (forsaken). Many Puranas say that the holy 
place is so called because it was never forsaken by Siva (so-ne- 
times both Siva and his consort) iai In the Lingapnrann 
another derivation is suggested" 22 "avi means' sin ; that 
holy place is devoid of sin". The Kasikhnnda ( 39. , 4 ) statin 
that originally the kselra was called AnandakSnana ana then 
Avimukta because though Siva went to stay on Murium 
mountain he did not leave it entirely but left Ins hhgu there

jyi Why Kasi is caked gmasana 627 

The Skanda says . 1424 ' sma ' means a corpse and ' sana ' means 
' lying down '; when the end of the world comes, the great 
elements lie here as corpses and therefore this place is called 
Mahasmasana." The Padmapurana lws makes Siva say • ' Avi- 
mukta is a famous cemetery becoming the Destroyer { or the 
Time Spirit) I being here destroy the world'. Matsya very 
frequently speaks of "Varanasi as Smasana. The Kaslkhanda 
states: if a man after reaching the great cemetery dies there by 
fate he has never again to lie in the cemetery ( i. e. he is not 
born again ). 

Although generally Kasi, Varanasi and Avimukta are used 
as synonyms in the Puranas, in some passages a distinction is 
made between these as to extent. The passages quoted above 
( in note 1419) show that Varanasi is bounded by the Varans 
and Asi on the north and south, 1426 the Ganges on the east and 
the shrine of Vmayaka in the west, Ain. A ( vol II p. 158 ) 
remarks that Benares is a laTge city situated between the 
rivers Barns and Asi and that it is built in the form of a bow 
of which the Ganges forms the string. The Matsyapurana 1427 
states : ' that ksetra is two yojanas and a half east and west and 
half a yojana broad north and south; out of this VararjasI 
extends up to the dry river ( viz. Asi )'. The first part appears 
to deal with the entire Kasiksetra which according to the 
Padmapurana 1418 comprised the tract covered by a circle the 
radius of which was the line joining Madhyamesvara-hnga

Brahmesvara to the south. A few more passages on the extent

IV] Ettent of Kasi in medieval looilcs 629 

Brahma is supposed to have said to Rudra ' I have given you a 
ksetra of the extent offivekrosas; when the best of rivers, 
Gangs, will flow through this ksetra, the city will be great and 
holy, the Ganges, as it flows northwards ( in Banaras ) for two 
yojanas, will be holy '. If in any texts there be any differences 
between the extents of Avimukta, it must be supposed that 
there is an option, 1431 (or, as the Tlr. G. suggests, the differences 
refer to different kalpas i. e. ages ). It is clear that Varanasi 
was that strip of land, the four boundaries of which were the 
Ganges to the east, Asi to the south, the shrine of Dehali- 
Vinayaka to the west and the river Varana to the noith. In 
the 7th century HiouenThsang, the Chinese pilgxim, notes that 
Banaras was 18 lis ( about 3 J miles ) in length and about 5 or 6 
lis ( a little more than a mile ) in breadth. This makes it clear 
that the city was then bounded as now by the Varana and Asi 
Vide Beal's B R. W. W ( vol H p. 44 ). 

Verses laudatory of the greatness and uniqueness of 
Varanasi literally run into thousands. AH that can be done 
here is to set out a few characteristic verses. The Vanaparva 
observes . 143S a person coming to Avimukta and resorting to the 
sacred place becomes free from the sin of brahmana-murder by 
merely seeing the (image of the) Lord of gods (i e. Visvesvara) 
and if he dies there he secures moksa. The Matsyapurana '« 6 
contains many striking passages about the unique greatness of 
Banaras "Varanasi is always my most secret place; it is always 
the cause of moksa for all beings. Moksa may be effected in 
Prayaga or in this city because I have taken it under my 
protection, this place is greater than even Prayaga, the fore- 
most among tlrthas. All the sins *« th at a man may have

when they succumb to death in course of time all find happiness

have a bull as their conveyance." A person, 1438 even though his 
mind may be addicted to pleasures of sense and though he may 
have given up devotion to dJiartna, if he dies in this place 
(Banaras) he does not again enter upon the path of samsara (the 
cycle of births and deaths) ; a man concentrating his mind for 
thousands of past lives may secure Yoga; hut by dying (in 
Banaras) he secures the highest moksa in this very life. Even 
if a man he a sinner 1439 or a rogue or irreligious he becomes

ingly — all those are reduced to ashes when he enters Avimukta. 
Even a ndeccha resident in KasI is better, since his future will 
he blissful, but not one residing elsewhere, though he may be 
a dlksita, because he will not be a recipient of miiktu' 

Tn some passages a mystic flavour is imparted to Vsranasi 
and the rivers. For example, the Kaslkhanda says that Asi is 
the Ida nadl, Varana is the Pingala nadl, Avimukta is susumria 
and VaranasI is all the three. 14 * 4 The LingapurSna, however, 
puts the matter somewhat differently. It holds that Asi (the 
dried-up river), Varana and Matsyodari ( i. e. Ganges ) are 
respectively the Pingala, Ida and Susumna, 

It is time now to turn to the individual sacred spots in 
Banaras. It is stated in some of the Puranas 14ts that at every 
step in the KssTksetra there is a holy place and that there is not 
even as much space as a sesamum seed in Kasi which has not a 
hnga (emblem of Siva). As a matter of fact the Kaslkhanda 
names 64 lingas in chap. 10 alone. But one must look to the 
tlrthas that are specifically named. Hiouen Thsang says that 
there were one hundred temples at Banaras in his day and he 
speaks of a temple where the copper image of Deva Mahesvara 
was a little less than 100 feet high ( vide Beat's B R, W. W. 
vol. IL pp. 44-45). Unfortunately, the fanatical zeal and rutb- 
lessness of Moslem rulers demolished almost all Hindu temples 
at different times from 1194 to about 1670 A. D. Mosques and 
mausoleums were erected on their sites, and the materials of 
the temples thus razed were used in constructing mosques 
and for serving as breakwaters &c. Eutubdin Aibak destroyed 
about 1000 temples in 1194 A. D (vide Elliot and Dowson's 

« f^ri? 3 ^' V i* n R 222) A^din Khiki boasted 
that he had destroyed one thousand temples in Banaras alone 
(videShemngp.31.Havellp.76). About 1585 A. D. Narayana- 
bfaatta re-established the temple of Visvanatha with the help

of Raj&Todarmal 1446 . Even this temple was desecrated. The 
following passage from the Ma-A'sir-i-A.'lamgrei quoted by 
Elliot and Dowson ('History of India,' vol. VII, p 184) is in- 
structive : " It reached the ears of his Majesty, the protector of 
the faith, that in the provinces of Thatta, Multan and Benares, 
but especially in the latter foolish brShmanas were in the 
habit of expounding frivolous hooks in their schools and that 
students and learners, Musalmans as well as Hindus, went 
there even from long distances, led hy a desire tohecome 
acquainted with the wicked sciences they taught. 'The Direc- 
tor of the Faith ' consequently issued orders to all the gover- 
nors of provinces to destroy with a willing hand the schools 
and temples of the infidels, and they were strictly enjoined to 
put an entire stop to the teaching and practising of idolatrous 
forms of worship On the 15th Babiu-lakhir tf. e. December 
1669) it was reported to his religious Majesty, leader of the 
Unitarians, that in obedience to order, the Government officers 
had destroyed the temple of Bishnath at Benares. 1

to place as the vicissitudes of the times required and the pil- 
grims performed parts of the worship (such as namaskara and 
circumambulation) at the site of the image, but they could not 
perform other portions of the worship such as bathing the image 
with Gauges water 144s . The present temple of Visvanatha 
was built in the last quarter of the 18th century by Devi 
Akalyabni Holkar (Altekar, p. 57). The Tri. S. p. 183, while on 
the question of the appearance (pradurbhava) of Visvesvara, 
observes that there is no blemish in the case of the Visvesvara- 
linga due to the touch of the untouchable, that every day 
Visvesvara removes it by a bath in Manikarnika at dawn and 
the worship offered by Himself and quotes a verse of the Sanat- 
kumara-savnhita. in support 1449 What the Tri. S. means is : 
Generally great care is taken about UAgas. All and sundry 
are not allowed to touch them but in the case of the Visve- 
svara-linga any one, even a great sinner, may worship it and 
pour Ganges water over it. Whether Narayanabhatta meant 
that even the so-called untouchables might touch it is not clear. 

It appears that Vacaspati 1M9s holds that Avimuktesvara 
hnga is the same as Visvanatha, but both the Tristha]i-setu 
(p 296) and Tlr. Pr. (p. 187) reject this idea. The Skanda- 
purana (Kasi. 10. 93) mentions Visvesvara and Avimuktesvara 
as separate hiigas. Besides worshipping Visvanatha, eveTy 
pilgrim to Benares has to visit the five tirthas MS0 (Pancatlrthi)

Kesava,' Bindumadhava and Manikarnika mm In modem tinws 
the five essential tirthas called Paficatlrfchl are the confluenoe 
oftheAsi with the Ganges, the Dasggyamedha ghat, Mani- 
karaika, the Paficaganga ghat and the confluence of the river 
Varans (called Barna by the common people) with the Ganges. 
This is based on the Kaslkhanda." 52 The shrine of LolSika is 
situated at the confluence of the Asi (the southern boundary 
of Banaras) with the Ganges. The Kaslkhanda 1ws furnishes a 
popular etymology for the name Lolaxka, viz. that the mind of 
the Sun on seeing KasI became agitated. The Asi is a tolerably 
wide stream (about 40 feet) in the raiDy season, but is dry at 
other times. The several gigantic ghats with their flights of 
stone steps are a grand sight at Banaras. The Ganges white 
passing by Banaras takes a great sweep so that its mighty 
current flows in a northerly direction (that j*b towards the 
Himalaya) and is therefore held to be peculiarly holy here. 
The Dasasvamedha-ghat has bBen famed for centuries, 
Jayaswal's interpretation of the epithets applied to the Bh5ra- 
sivas in VakStaka grants should be accepted viz. the Bhara&ivas 
were an imperial dynasty, were crowned with the holy waters 
of the Ganges and took their ceremonial baths on the Ganges 
at the end of ten Asvamedha sacrifices, on account of which the 
Dasasvamedha-ghat »*» at Banaras was so named (Jayaswal's

the Dasasvamedhaghat at dawn. For the eulogy of Dasasva- 
medha, vide Kaslkhanda 52. 83 ff and Tri. S. p. 159. The 
Kaslkhanda says that formerly the tirtha was called Rudrasaras, 
but as Brahma performed ten Asvamedhas there it came to he 
called Dasasvamedha (chap 52. 66-68). The Manikamika (also 
called Mukti-ksetra) pool is the very centre of the religious life 
of Banaras and 145S is the most holy among all the Banaras 
tirthas. The Kaslkhanda gives a phantastic story of its origin 
(in chapter 26 verses 51-63 quoted in Tri. S. pp. 145-146) : Visnu 
dug with his discus a puskarinl, filled it with the perspiration 
from his own body and performed severe austerities on its bank 
for 1050 (ot 50000) yeais. Siva came there and being pleased 
shook his head and an ear-ornament studded with jewels fell 
into the pool, which thenceforward came to be called Mani- 
kamika. The word is "55 derived in two ways in the K&sl- 
khanda. Siva who is like the wish-yielding jewel whispers 
in the ear (karnika) of good men the Taraka mantra 
at the time of death. The extent of Manikamika north to 
south is said to be 105 hastas i e. about 160 feet (Kaslkhanda 
99. 54). In modern times the waters of the Manikamika pool 
become foul and fetid because ifc is shallow (two or three feet 
deep), because hundreds of pilgrims cast into it flowers and 
money by way of worship and because the priests stir the 
waters with their hands and feet to find the coins dropped by 
pilgrims. Our methods of worship must be changed The 
flowers and gifts should be placed on the banks of the pool and 
then taken away by the priests. The Tri S. p. 147 mentions 
several mantras (two of which are set out below) to be recited 
when contemplating on Manikamika *«? Near the Mani 
karnika pool is the temple of Tarakesvara so named from the 
belief thatSrvawffl whisper the mantra called taraka in the ear of

the dying man brought to the sacred pool 11 "" (vide Kasikhanda 
7.78, 25. 72-73 and 32. 115-116). The Pafieaganga, ghat is so 
called because it is supposed that five rivers, viz the Kirana, 1 * 58 
DhutapapS, Ganga, Yamuna and Sarasvatl, meet hare (though 
four of them are invisible) This is very highly eulogised 
and it is said m the Naradiyapurana and the Kasikhanda (59. 
118-133) that when a man takes a bath in the Pafioanada he is 
not born again in a body made up of the five elements. It is 
said that this confluence of five rivers had different names viz. 
Dharraanada, Dhutapataka, Bmdutlrtha and Pafioanada in 
Krta and the following Yugas respectively The Kasikhanda 
in chap. 59 deals with the confluence of five rivers and gives 
phantastic legends as to why the rivers were called Kirana 
(59. 108-113) and DhutapSpa (59 101-106). The river Varana is 
the northern boundary of VaranasI and the end of the ghats on 
the northern side is reached at the confluence of the Varana 
with the Ganges, That the ghats have been there for at least a 
thousand years oan be proved from copperplates and inscrip- 
tions. The Gabadvala rulers of Kanoj (of whose times at least 
55 copperplates and 3 inscriptions on stone were issued during 
the period 1097 to 1187 AD), being devotees of Visnu, several 
times made grants at the Adi-Kesava ghm. Vide J. B AS.

6a& Mistory of bharmaiastra [ VoJ, 

There are numerous other sub-tlrthas in Banaras, some of 
which may be briefly noticed here. The Jfianavapl may be 
mentioned first. The story of its origin is narrated in the 
Kaslkhanda, ohap. 33. The Tri. S (pp. 148-150) refers to it. 
It is said that when Siva (Isgna) saw the Visvesvara-linga a 
desire arose in him to bathe with its cool water. He dug a 
kif&da with his trident to the south of the temple of Visvesvara 
and with the water therefrom he bathed Visvesvara-linga and 
Visvesvara granted the boon that the tlrtha would be superior 
to all t&thas and that, as Siva is knowledge (verse 32), tbfl 
tlrtha would be called Jfianoda or Jfianavapl. One of the most 
popular and the most frequented temple is that of Durga. In 
chap. 1% (verses 37-65) of the Kaslkhanda there is a Durgastotra 
called Vajra-pafijaTa which is referred to in Tri. S. p. 161. 
There is a temple of Bhairavanatha about a mile to the north

being hungry and angry was on the point of cursing Kail in 
the words quoted below li61 when Siva coming to know his mind 
assumed the form of a householder, gave him the best of food 
and ordered Vyasa not to enter Kaslksetra as he was an irri- 
table man, but allowed him to do so on the 8th and 14th tithts 
only. The Kasikhanda 96. 12-80 and 119-180 speak at great 
length about how one residing in KasI should conduct himself. 

Some miscellaneous matters in connection with Banaras 
may be set out here. VaranasI being a great tirtha, sraddha for 
the benefit of ancestors should be performed there and if it is not 
possible to perform a sraddha with all details, at least offerings 
of pindas should be made. 1462 The constiuction of mathas for 
those who praotise penance there and endowing them with 
means for their maintenance are highly eulogized. 1463 

In the 12th century A D. there was a KapSlamocanaghat 1464 
situated on the Ganges. In a grant published in E. I. vol. IV 
p. 110 dated samvat 1178 (1123 A D.) the Emperor Govindacandra 
bestowed a village on a brShmana named Vyasa after bathing 
at the Kapala-mocanaghatta in Banaras where the Ganges flows 
to the north. The story of Kapalamooana-tlrtha is narrated in 
the Matsya-purana, chap. 183. 84-103 and a reference is made 
to it in Kasikhanda 33. 116.

Trilocana, Mahadeva, Krttivasas, Ratnesa, Candresvara,

Manikarnlsa, Avimukta, Visvesvara. It is provided in Kasl- 
fchanda 73 39 that yabras of these main hngas should ba cele- 
brated every month from the 1st tithi onwards In Kasikhanda 
73. 45-48 there is another series of fourteen great lingas diffe- 
rent from those in ohap 73. 32-36. Fourteen ayatanas are 
named in Kasikhanda 73. 60-62. MS16 Twelve out of these are 
specified as lmgas in Lingapurana I. 92.67-107. In Kasikhanda

In ohap. 94. 36 of the Kasikhanda 36 principal lingas are re- 
ferred to (14 OmkarSdi, 8 DaksesvarSdi and 14 Sailesadi). 
From considerations of spaoe the other lingas and tirthas are 
not mentioned here. But out of all these Visvesvara is said to 
give quick results.

mokscu, Those who being residents of Kasi commit sins have 
not to undergo the tortures of Yama whether they die in Kasi 
or. elsewhere. Those who after committing sins in Kasi die 
there will he punished by Kalabhairava Those who die else- 
where (after committing sins in Kasi) first undergo torments 
inflicted by the ganas of Siva called Yama, then undergo tor- 
ments inflicted by Kalabhairava for thirty thousand years, are 
then born as mortal men, then die in Kasi and secure release 
(from, samsara) at the end. 

It is remarkable that the Kaslkhanda 1467 states that & 
little to the north of Kasi, Visnu assigned a place for his resid- 
ence called Dharaiaksatra and that there Visnu assumed the 
form of Buddha. This is a clear reference to Sarnath about five 
miles by road to the north of BaiiaTas, where Buddha delivered 
his first sermon The general rule for ascetics is that for eight 
months they must move from place to place and may spend the 
four months of the rainy season or two months in one place; but 
this rule is abrogated where ascetics enter Banaras and it is 
laid down that they should not leave Kail at all. 1467 " 

The Kaslkhanda remarks 'For devotees of Siva who are 
full of faith there is, even in great calamities, no other remedy 
except the water of the feet of the image of God Incurable 
diseases even, whether affecting the body outside or inside, are 
got rid of by the touch with faith of the water of (washing the 
image of) the deity.* This reminds qne of the miraculous cures 
believed to have been effected by the water of a pool at Lourdes 
in the first years of this century 14S7 &. 

It would be far beyond the scope of this section to dilate 
upon the great traditions of learning associated with the name 
of Banaras. It is sufficient to refer to Alberuni (vol

CHAPTER XTV 
GAYS 

GayS occupies a unique place in the hearts of all pious 
Hindus even in these days. Hundreds of pages have been 
■written about the history, the antiquities, the architectural 
remains of Gaya, the sacred places in and round about Gaya, 
the sraddha rites performed in Gaya and about Gayawals (the 
priests of Gaya). it is not possible to deal with this vast mass 
in this work. But it is impossible not to say a few words about 
the many conflicting views on certain important matters put 
forward by scholars for about three quarters of a century. 
Those who are deeply interested in the history and antiquities 
of Gaya should carefully read the following books and papers ; 
Dr. RajendraM Mitra's 'Buddha-Gaya* with 51 plates (1S78); 
General Cunningham's 'Mahabodhf with 31 plates at the end 
(1S92) ; L. S. S. O'Malley' s Dist rict Gazetteer of Gavg, vol. XII

644 History of Nwarmaiadra [Vo], 

The most important work on GayS relied upon in such 
works as the Tristhali-setu and in modem times is the Gaya- 
mabatmya that occurs at the end of the Vayupurana (chapters 
105-112 of the Anandasrama ed.). Scholars differ about the 
antiquity of these chapters. Rajendralal Mitra assigned the 
Gaya-mahatmya to the 3rd or 4th century A, D. O'Malley was 
inclined to hold that the legend of Gayasura was invented in 
the 14th or 15th century, principally on the ground that the 
GaySwals profess the Vaisnava faith established by Madhva- 
carya t46s and acknowledge as their spiritual head the vnahant 
of Hari Narasimhapura; Tide J. A. S. B. vol. LXXH (1903) 
p. 4. To my mind there is hardly anything in this. The 
GaySwals are notorious for their indolence, dissoluteness and 
ignorance and they are a dying race. O'Malley himself notte 
in the paper mentioned above (at p. 8) that originally the 
families of GaySwals were 1484, that in Buchanan Hamilton's 
time they numbered about 1000, that in 1893 a Gayawal counted 
128 families, that in the census of 1901 there existed only 168 
males (as pure GaySwals) and 153 females. Gays is a place 
sacred to Yisnu and if the GaySwals had to turn in medieval 
times for support to some great aeSrya they would naturally 
choose to align themselves with the Vaisnava acarya Madhva 
rather than with Ankara Dr. Barua, after an elaborate examv-

IV] Dr. Barua an. GayamaJiatmya 645 

-Brahmayupa, Sivalinga and Vrsabha there is no refe- 
rence to any struotnral erection nor any iconic suggestion'. 
In order to show how this conclusion is not at all justified the 
references to Gaya in the Epic and other Sanskrit works will 
have to be set out and compared with each other and with the 
Gayamahatmya. The second reason that vitiates Dr. Barua'B 
conclusion is the wrong interpretation that he puts on verse 
12 of the Inscription edited by Kielhorn in I A. vol 16. 

I shall now turn to the name Gaya and references to it or 
similar names from the Rgveda downwards. A Gaya, son of 
Plati, is the reputed author of two hymns of the Rgveda (X. 63 
and X. 64). In Rg X 63. 17 and X 64. 17 we have the words 
'astavi jano divyo Gayena* (the divine host was praised by 
Gaya). So Gaya was a proper name applied to a composer of 
Rgvedic hymns. In the Rg. the word Gaya has several other 
senses, which are not material heTe. In the Atharvaveda (L 14.4) 
Gaya appears to be a wonder-worker or a sorcerer along with 
Asita and Kasyapa. Even in the Vedic Samhitas Asuras* Dasas 
and Raksasasare credited- with tricks and magic. "Vide Rg VII 
99.4, Vlt 104.24-25 and Atharva IV. 23. 5. It is not difficult to 
imagine how a sorcerer Gaya could have been transformed into 
Gayasura later on. Proceeding further, the Nirukta 1469 while 
explaining 'idam Visnur-vi cakrame tredha nidadhe padam' 
($g. L 22. 17) gives two very interesting interpretations, one 
explaining the verse as a natural phenomenon and the other 
explaining it from geographical or legendary points of view 
He (Visnu) puts down his foot in three ways. According to 
Sakapuni. Visnu plants his foot on the earth, in mid air (sky) and 
heaven; according to Aurnavabha, on Samarohana, on Visnu- 
pada and on Gayasiras.' Whatever the Vedic verse may mean 
it is clear that two interpretations had arisen several centuries' 
before Christ and if the usual dates abont Buddha's nirvana 
are accepted Aurnavabha and YSska both flourished before 
Buddha. Vide S. B. E. vol. XTB pp. XXH-XXIH for Buddha's

IV] Visrfupada and Gayastras 647 

these, Visnup3da and Gayasiras are well-known; hdnee it would 
not be unreasonable to hold that ' Samarohana' is a place and 
has to be located somewhere near the other two. Samarohana 
means 'mounting up' or 'ascending'. This word probably refers 
to the ascent of the hill that rises up from the river Phalgu. 
It is also possible that it is the same as the Udyanta hill 
echoing with the warbling (of birds) UK I therefore hold that at 
least 600 years before Christ (and hence ' even before Buddha) 
there was a tradition about Visna's footprints in at least two 
well-known places viz. Visnupada and Gaya-siras (both in Gaya), 
Even if some other work doss not mention any one of these it 
does not follow from mere non-mention that that spot was not 
so named or did not exist. 

Let us now turn to the Vanaparva.' Dr. Barua mainly 
relies, on Vanaparva 84. 82-103 and 95. 9-S9. But some 
preliminary remarks must ba made before the two passages ate 
examined. - - 

The NaradlyapurSna (uttara, 46. 16) states that Gayasiras 
extends from KrauSoapada to Phalgutirtha. 

Vanaparva chapter 82 sets out Pulastya's replies to 
Bhtsma's question about tlrthas. First comes Puskara (verses 
?™" ,* h8 t j3mbumai « a . TanduHkasrama, Agastyasarah, 
Mahakala, Kotitlrtha, Bhadravata (Sthanutlrtha), tfarmads 
Prabhasa and several other tlrthas (not in any particular order 
but selected at random). In chap: 83 Kuruksetra "is described 
at some length. , 

Before discussing the most important passage f the Tana- 
t£Ti V r ' 82 - 10 :?>™ must see what precedes the descr^ 
turn of Gaya. Dr. Barua and many of those that have written 
on this passage have not carefully considered the implications 
of verses 1-81 of chapter 84 and also of the following XZ

and Yamuna, KubjSmraka) and then comes ,to apeak of the 
sacred spots in Gaya im It is therefore clear that the intention 
of the author is not to speak exhaustively about any tlrtha. 
For this reason some tirthas are described twice in the Vana- 
parva. For example Naimisa is very highly praised in ohap. 84, 
59-64 and again in chap. 87. 6-7. The same happens with.re-

IV] Sacred spots in Qaya and Vanaparva 649 

from the manner in which ttrthas in Qaya are named and des- 
cribed that the writer of Vanaparva (chap. 84. 82-103) meant to 
be exhaustive as regards the holy spots in Gaya or the legends 
about Gaya. This conclusion is very much strengthened by 
the fact that in the Anusasanaparva three saored spots in Gaya 
aTe mentioned which do not occur in Vanaparva 84. 82-103 viz. 
'In Gaya a man becomes purified in Asmaprstha (the same as 
Pretasila), on the hill Niravinda and of even a third brahmana 
murder in Krauncapadi'. 1 * 7 * These three, Asmaprstha, Nira- 
vinda and Krauncapadi, are in addition to those sacred spots 
that are mentioned in Vanaparva 84. In Vayu 109.15 a hill 
Aravindaka is said to be a peak oF the Silaparvata and Naradlya 
(uttara 47. 83), Vayu 108.75 and Naradiya Oittara 46. 16) men- 
tion the hill Krauficapada (Munda-prstha was so oalled) There- 
fore it is clear that three important sites in the Gayamahatmya 
are mentioned by the Anusasanaparva. 

It was unfortunate that Dr. Barua confined his attention 
on the question of the antiquity of Gaya to merely three works 
viz. the Vanaparva chapters 84 and 95, the Agnipurana chap. 
114-116 and the Vayupurana chapters 105-112. He did not 
care to investigate all the other Puranas nor did it strike him 
that the explanation of three padas of Visnu furnished by 
Aumavabha probably referred to spots around Gaya alone. 
Other Puranas such as Padma (Adikhanda 38. 2-21), Garuda 
I chapters 82-86, and the Naradiya (uttara chap. 44-47) contain 
much that concerns Gaya and all of them have many verses in 
common. The critical edition of the Mahabharata (published by 
the B O. R. I., Poona) reads 'savitram padam' (chap. 82.81) for 
'savitryastu padam' of the Bombay edition. The reading of the 
critical edition is supported by numerous and ancient Mss. 
Further, the printed Padmapurana (in Adikhanda 38. 13) 
reads * Savitram padam' and thus lends support to the reading 
adopted in the critical edition. The words 'savitram padam' 
may be taken to mean the foot-print of Visnu (Savitr). Dr. 
Barua goes very much further than the facts warrant when he 
says that there is no reference in the Vanaparva to any struc- 
tural erection or iconic suggestion. It is clear that there must 
hare been an image of Dharma, since the Vanaparva speaks of

engraved about 1040 A.D. Dr. Barua thought that Uttaramanasa 
was dug up at that time and therefore Uttaramanasa tank 
is taken to be not older than 1040 A, D. and that it and 
many of the sacred spots must have been later and the Gaya- 
mahatmya which speaks of Uttarmanasa must be much later 
than the 11th century A, D. But Dr Barua is entirely mistaken 
in this. If a tank was dug up for the fii st time at the time of 
the inscription, it is impossible that it should have been called 
'khyata' (famous). The tank can become famous some centuries 
after it was dug. TTttarmanasa tank is mentioned as & sacred 
spot in Vayupurana 77. 108 (which verse is quoted about 1110 
A, D. in the Kalpataiu on tiitha at p. 168), Vayu 82. 31, Agni 
115. 10. Therefore Uttaramanasa tank was well known at least 
in the 8th or 9th century A. D. "What the inscription means is 
eitheT that the famous tank had silted up and so it was dug up 
or that it was made longer, broader and deeper m about 1040 
That is all. 

In my opinion the Gayamahatmya (Vayu, chap. J05-112), 
though possibly later than the main text of the Vayupurana[ 
cannot be placed so late as the 13th or 14th century A. D. It is 
really a patch-work from many sources of earlier times such as 
the Vanaparva, Anusasanaparva, Padma I 38, the Naradlya 
(uttara) chap. 44-47 Several verses and half verses of it are 
repetitions (such as the half verse 'Gayayam aksayam sraddham 
japahomatapamsi ca' Vayu 108 35 and Vayu 82.43 quoted as 
from Vayu in Kalpataru on tirtha p. 167, and Vayu 110 39-30 
are the same as Vayu 105.37-38. So also Vayu 82 31-33 are the 
same as Vayu 110. 51-53. Dr. Barua does not notice that in 
chap. 82 of the Vayu (20-24) several sub-tlrthas of Gaya are ex- 
pressly mentioned via. BrahmakuBda.Prabhasa.Pretaparvata,

Having disposed of the question of tho date of the G.iys-

Vanaparva itself references to Gaya occur in chap. 87 and chap. 
95. Vanaparva, chap. 87, starts by saying that going tow ards ttie

Vanaparva chap. 87 goes onto refer to the holy river (maha-

offered to pitrs becomes inexhaustible. In Vanaparva 95 men- 
tion is made of Brahmasaras (where Agastya went to Dharma- 
raja i. e. Yam a, verse 12), of Aksayavata (v. 14) which is an 
imperishable place of worship and where the fruit (of offerings 
made) is inexhaustible; it further states that king Gaya, son of 
Amiirtarayas, U77B performed a sacrifice in which food and fees 
in plenty were distributed (verses 18-19). Vas. (XI 42) states: 
when, a man goes to Gaya and offers food his ancestors become 
delighted like agriculturists that rejoice when there is good rain 
and pitrs become (really) putrm (having a son) on account of 
such a son The VismidhaTmasutoa, chapter 85, 147a mentions 
by name about 55 holy places that are most proper for sraddha 
among which those connected with Gaya are Gayasirsa, Aksaya- 
vata, Phalgu, Uttaramanasa, Matangavapl, Visnupada, and 
winds up by quoting three verses as gatlias sung by pitrs. - Taj. I. 
261 states that whatever a man gives while in Gaya leads to 
inexhaustible rewards. A.tri-smrti ( 55-58 ) refers to a son's 
going to Gaya for the benefit of the pitrs, to a bath in Phalgu 
and tarpana of pitrs in the river, to seeing Gadadhara (Visnu) 
at Gaya and to Gayaslrsa. Sankha (14 27-28) refers M « to

become inexhaustible. The Likhita-Smrti speakB 1180 of the, 
importance of Gaya as follows: In whosesoever nameapinda 
is offered at Gayasiras, whether for oneslf or for another, that 
person, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven that man 
secures release (from samara). The Kurmapurana remarks 
that one should desire to have many sons so that if one out of 
them goes to Gaya on some other business and offers srsddha, 
ho thereby saves his pitrs and himself reaches the highest goal. 
The Matsyapurana (22. 4-6) quoted by the Kalpataru (on tirtha 
p. 163) speaks of Gaya as pitrtlrtha and as the best among 
tlrtbas where Brahma himself dwells and also has the verse 
'eslavya bahavah putrah'. 

In the Gayamahatmya (Vayupurana, chapters 105-112) 
there arc about 560 verses. An attempt will be made here to 
give a brief summary of it and some of the important verses 
will bo quoted. Chapter 105 is general and briefly indicates 
some of the main topics dealt with in the following chapters. 
It states that in Svetavarahakalpa Gaya performed a saonfice 
and Gaya was named after him" 81 , that pttrs hanker after 
eons because the son that goes to Gaya saves the jntrs from 
hell «" At Gaya a man should offer ptnfas to his father and

Gaya renders the others unnecessary 14Si . Sraddha may be 
performed at Gaya at all times, even in an intercalary month, 
on the anniversary of one's birthday, or even when Jupiter 
and Venus are invisible or when Jupiter is in Leo. One should 
honour the brahmanas (of Gaya) that were established there 
by Brahma; when they are gratified all deities together with 
the pitas are gratified. Tonsure uss and fast are to be observed 
at all tlrthas except in Kuruksetra, Visala, Viraja and Gaya. 
A.n ascetic 1186 (sannyasin) should not offer pindas (at Gaya) 
but should merely exhibit (hold up) his staff and should put it 
down on Visnupada The (whole) Gayaksetra is five krosas in 
extent and Gayasiras is one krosa and all the tirthas of the 
three worlds are centered in these two 1487 . A.fc Gaya one may 
offer (to pitrs) pindas by means of p&yasa (rice cooked in 
milk), boiled rice, barley flour, fruits and roots, the 
cake of sesame ( after oil is extracted ), sweetmeats or jag- 
gery with ghee or with curds alone or with invigorating 
honey. In a sraddha at Gaya, the procedure consists in pre- 
paring im a seat for the pindas, the offering of pindas, the 
sprinkling of water again (on the kusa grass), giving fees and 
declaration of dinner (to brahmanas) ; but there is no invoca- 
tion of pitrs, no curtains for privacy and no blemish due to 
sraddha being seen (by undesirable persons or animals) Those 
who desire to reap the full fruit of sraddha performed at a 
ttrtha (like Gaya) must give up passionate longings, anger and

Chap. 106 narrates the story of Gayasura. Gayasura a 
very powerful as «,a 125 2/o^ aS in height and 60 yoWin 
girth, performed severe austerities for thousands of years on 
the mounton oaM Kolahala. The gods, ansious andSLT 
ed by his austerities, went to Brahma for protection. Brahma 
took them to Siva who proposed to go to Visnu. Brahma Siva 
and the gods praised Visnu, who appeared to them and said that 
they should, riding their respective conveyances, go toGaya- 
sura. Visnu asked him why he practised severe austerities 
and said that the boon he would ask would be granted He 
asked the boon that he should be purer than all the gods, sages, 
mantras, ascetics &c The gods said 'Jet it be so* and left for 
heaven. All people who saw or touched Gayasura's holy body 
went to heaven. The capital of Yama became deserted and so 
he went to Brahma who took him to Visnu who asked Brahma to 
request Gayasura to give his pure body for the purpose of a sac- 
rifice. Gayasura agreed and fell down on the earth towards the 
southwest with his head on the north on Kolahala mountain and 
feet to the south. Brahma collected materials and mind-born 
rlvtks (about 40 are named) and performed a sacrifice on the body 
of Gayasura. That body, however, was not stable but moved 
and hence Brahma asked Yama to place on Gayasura's head a 
kla (stone slab) that was in Yama's house. Yama did so; yat 
Gayasura's body together with the site still moved, Brahma 
asked Siva and other gods to stand immoveable on the sils. 
They did so and yet the body moved. Hence Brahma went to 
Visnu and requested him to make the body and sila stable 
Visnu gave his own murii and though it was placed on the sila 
it still moved. Then Visnu sat on the sila m three forms vw 
Janardana, Pundarlka and Sdi-Gadadhara, Brahma in five forms 
(Prapitamaha,Pitamaha,PhaIgvlsa, Eedara and Kanakesvara), 
Vinayaka in the form of an elephant, the Sun in three forms, 
the Goddesses Lakslmi (as Sits), Gauri (as Mangala), Gayatil

and Sarasvatl. As Gayasura was made stable by the first Gads 
(mace) wielded by Hari, therefore Hari was called Adigada- 
dhara. 1 * 90 Gayasura complained 'why am I deceived' I have 
given my pure body to Brahma for the latter's sacrifice. Would 
I not have become stable at the mere word of Visnu (why tor- 
ment me with the mace ?).' Then the gods asked him to choose a 
boon. He ohose 'As long as the earth, mountains, the Sun, Moon 
and stars last, may Brahma, Visnu and Siva and the other gods 
remain on the sila' Let this sacred spot be known by my name. 
Let all tftthas be centered in the midst of Gaya which is five 
kroias in extent and in Gayasiras which is one krosa and do 
good to people. May all the gods remain here in manifest forms 
( images &c ) and unmanif est forms (such as footprints &c ) i 
Those to whom sraddha with pindas is offered may go to the 
world of Brahma and all grave sins like brahmana-murder be 
destroyed at once.' The gods said 'Let it be so.* Then 
Brahma gave to the brahmanas Gaya (with its extent of five 
krosas), 55 villages, well-furnished houses, desire-yielding 
cow and trees, a river flowing with milk, golden wells, heaps of 
food, but enjoined on them not to beg from any one else. But the 
brahmanas, greedy as they were, performed a sacrifice for 
Dharma in Dhaimaranya and begged him for fees. Then 
Brahma came, cursed them and took away everything from 
them. When the brahmanas bewailed that they had been 
deprived of everything and their livelihood should be provided 
for, Brahma said that they would live on the charity of pilgrims 
to Gaya and those who would honour them would be honouring 
Brahma.

more holy than all rivers, sages and gods and that all tothas 
should stand in the slab of stone, that those who would bathe 
in the totbas on the sila and offer pindas and taddha should 
be able to go to brahmaloki, that all holy rivers like the Ganges 
should always remain in her. The gods conceded what she 
prayed for and said that when she would become stable on the 
head of Gayasura, they would all stand on the sils. 

i Chap. 108 presents numerous divergences in the Mss In 
the Anandasrama edition its contents briefly are: The sila 
was placed on the head of Gayasura and therefore there was 
union of two very, holy objects, on which Brahma performed 
Asvamedha and when the gods came to reoeive their share of 
the sacrificial offerings the sila said to Visnu and others 'pro- 
mise that you would remain on the Mia and would bring about 
•the release of pitrs '. The gods agreed and they stayed on the 
sila in the form of images and foot-prints. As the sils was 
placed on the back of the head of the asura the hill was called 
Mundaprstha (lit. the back of the head) which gave Brahma- 
( loka to pitrs. Then the chapter speaks of a hill called Pra- 
bhasa, of B&matlrtha near the place where the great river 
-{Phalgu) and Prabhasa hill meet, the hermitage of Bharata, of _ 
Matangapada, of the bah to be offered to Yamaraja and Dbarma- 
raja and to the dogs of Yama, via. Sygma and Sabala, oi the

mitage of Gyavana, the river Punahpuna, EJraufica-pada , 
Janardana on Bhasmakflta. 

The story of Gayasura has puzzled Mitra and subsequent 
writers, Mitra holds that nothing appears more absurd or 
stupid than the story of Gayasura who, he emphasizes, is not 
a demon or a vicious monster, but a devout Yaisnava ('Bodh- 
Gaya' pp. 15-16). The story of Gayasura is not unique. The 
Puranas abound in stories that appear to modern minds absurd 
and puerile. Besides, there were several asuras like Prahlada, 
Bana (devotee of Siva) and Bali (who was an exemplary and 
pious king and a worshipper of Visnu ) that were not monsters 
but good and devout persons, and yet fought with gods. For ex- 
ample, Kurmapuiana (L 16. 59-60 and 91-92) narrates that 
Prahlada fought with Nrsirnha*, the Padma (Bhumikhanda 
1.8) calls him a Mahabhagavata but states that he first fought 
with Visnu and entered Vaisnavltanu; while Vamanapur ana 
(ohap. 7-8) speaks of his fight with Naranarayana In Pali 
works (e. g. Anguttara-nikaya, part IV pp. 197-204) he is called 
PaharSda and asunnda (asurendra). Vide Anguttara-nikaya 
(text) vol. XV p. 197. For Bali who was grandson of Prahlada, 
a good king and a devotee of Visnu, vide Brahmapursna, chap. 
73, Kfimia 1. 17, Vsmana ( chapters 77 and 92). For Bana, son 
of Bali and the fight of Bana helped by Siva with Krsna, vide 
Brahma chap. 205-208 and Visnupurana V. 33. 37-38. 

According to Dr. Bajendralal Mitra (in 'Bodh-Gaya' pp. 14- 
18) the story of Gayasura is an allegory of the vanquishing 
of Buddhism by Brahmanism. O' Malley thought ( J. A S B 
vol. LXXH part 3 p. 7 for 1904) that the Gayasura legend" 
represents an amalgamation or compromise of Brahmanism 
with the popular demonolatry which preceded Brahmanism 
Dr. Baraa crifcisizes both theories and appears to hold (vol i' 
Pp. 40-41) that the idea underlying the legend is to impress on 
peoples minds the high sanctity of the Gaya range of hills 
along the western bank of the river Pkalgu, that Gaya figures 
nowhere in Buddhism, that Gaya«» or Namuci orVrtrais 
represented as a demon of darkness and as an enemy of Indra 
and that the Vedio word Trivikraina and the interpretation of 
Aurnavabha are the nucleus of the legend of Gayasura From 
considerations of spa ce it is not possible to discuss these

theories here. To my mind it appears that Gaya had become a 
famous pilrlirtlia centuries before Christ and that the legend of 
Gayasura is a post fado attempt to account for the sanctity 
of the place and the numerous shrines and holy places that hod 
sprung up round Gaya, 

Chap. 109 deals with the questions how Adi-Gadadlrara 
abided in manifest and unmanifest forms, how bis gada (mace) 
was produced and how the tlrfcha called Gadalola became a 
destroyer of all sinsr There was a powerful Asma called 
Gada, who, when BrahmS- requested, gave up his bones to 
BrahmS. Visvakarms, at the desire of Brahma, fashioned a 
wonderful mace out of the bones, In the times of Svsyambhuva 
Manu an Asura named Heti, son of BrahmS, performed 
severe austerities for thousands of divine years. He secured 
from Brahma and other gods the boon that he could not 
be killed by gods, dmtyas, men or with suoh weapons as 
the discus of Kisna and others. Heti conquered the gods and 
became Indra. The gods went to Hart and requested hirato 
kill Heti He asked for a powerful weapon and the gods gave 
him the mace manufactured from the bones of Gada and Visnu 
Wiled Heti with the Gada. This story about demon Heti is

fest form. Asura Heti was killed by Visnu and went to Visnu- 
loka. When the body of Gayasura was made stable Brahma 
sang a hymn of praise to Visnu who asked Brahma to choose a 
boon Brahma said 'we (gods ) shall not abide in the sila with- 
out you, but shall remain therein together with you if you have 
a manifest form.' ,19i Visnu said 'be it so' and Visnu stood on 
Gayasiras in the Adigadadhara form and as Janardana and 
Pundarikaksa. Siva also praised Visnu (Vayu 109. 43-50). 
The Vayu speaks at several places of 'vyaktavyakta' symbols 
of the deity (chap. 109. 20 and 43-45) What is meant is Visnu 
is non-manifest in Phalgu, vyaktavyakta in Visnupada and 
manifest in images and statues (vide Tristhallsetu p. 365, prati- 
masvarupl vyaktah). 

Chap. 110 deals with Gayayatra. To the east of Gaya is 
a great river ( Phalgu ). ( If it is dry ) one should dig a pit 
for water and take a bath, should perform tarpana and sraddha 
according to one's own recension of the Veda, but without arglnja 
(water for showing respect) and avahana (invoking) In the after-

noon the pilgrim should go to tbe Pretasila, take a bath in the 
Brahmakunda, offer tarpana to the gods and perform sraddha of 
his sapindas on the Pretasila with the mantras set out in Vayu 
(110.10-12) and offer pindas to his ancestors, InAstakas,ro 
VrddhisrSddha, at GayS and on the anniversary of death, one 
may offer a sraddha separately to one's mother but on all other 
occasions with her husband. 1 * 8 To the sapindaa other than one's 
paternal ancestors he should offer ST&ddha to the south (of the 
place where he offers to his father &c. ) viz. should spread 
kusas and once offer water mixed with sesame and should offer 
them a pinda made of barley flour and repeat the mantras 
(Vfiyu 110. 21-22). The pindas to he offered at GaySsiras 
may be in size as m big as one's closed hand, or an undried 
Smalaka (myrobalan) fruit or of the size of saml leaves. By 
means of these he saves seven gotras viz. that of his father, of 
his mother, of his wife, sister, daughter, paternal aunt and 
maternal aunt. Water mixed with sesame and pindas are 
offered to all persons on the maternal grandfather's side, to all 
bandhus, to all infants, to persons cremated or not cremated, to 
persons that were killed by lightning or robbers or that commit- 
ted Huicido in various ways and,to those who may be undergo- 
ing torments of Hells of various kinds and those who have 
become beasts or birds or insects or trees owing to evil deeds 
(Vayu 110, verses 30-55). The verses ot most comprehensive 
character about offering water have been cited in n. 1237 p. 550 
and on pp. 616-617 above.

this the persons for whom this is dons become free from the 
position of preta. It is stated (in Vayu 108. 17-22) that one 
should bathe in the Ramatfrtba which is near the place where 
Phalgu meets the Prabhasa MIL By bath in Ramatlrtha and 
offering of sraddha and pinda there the persons for whom this 
is done become pitrs (being already free from pretatva by the 
sraddha on pretasila). On a hill on the south of Pretasila one 
should offer a ball (food offered with kusa, sesame and water) 
to Yamaraja and Dharmaraja and to the two dogs Sygma and 
Sabala. On the next day after entering Gaya (i. e. the 2nd 
day), the pilgrim should proceed to the Pretaparvata U97 (Vayu 
110.8) and take a bath in the Brahmakunda and perform tar- 
pana, sraddha and giving of pindas mixed with sesame, ghee, 
curds and honey to his ancestors (father, grandfather fee.) 
with the mantras 'pita pitamahascaiva' (Vayu 110. 23-24). 
Then the pilgrim should offer on kusas, water, sesame and 
pindas to persons related in various ways with the mantras 
'asmat-kule mrta ye ca &c, (Vayu 110. 34-55). He should 
then invoke the gods to be witnesses to the fact of his having 
come to Gaya and become free from the debt to the ancestors 
(Vayu 110. 59-60). It is stated in Vayu 110.61 that at all 
Bacred spots in Gaya the offering of pindas should be done in 
the same way as at Pretaparvata 1 * 98 . 

On the third day of entering Gaya one has to perform 
PaScattrthI rites *«> (Vayu 111. 1 ft). The pilgrim first bathes 
in mtaranianasa, offers tarpana to gods, gives water and 
sraddha and pindas to his ancestors with the mantras (Va™ 
110 21-24) The fruit of this rite is the inexhausSe 2S

(on the south). At each of these three there is a sraddha. 
Then the pilgrim goes to the Phalgutlrtha, which is the bast 
of all (Gaya) ttrthas. The pilgrim performs tarpana and 
sraddha with pindas on Phalgu. This Sraddha at Phalgu results 
in muJdt for the performer and also for those for whose benefit 
it is performed (muktir-bhavati kartrnam pitfnam srsddbatah 
sada, Vayu 110. 13). It is stated that Phalgu is Adi-Gadadhaia 
himself m a fluid form. 1 * 00 By bath in Phalgu and seeing 
Gadadhara a man saves himself, ten ancestors and ten descend' 
ants. Then he worships Gadadhara by a bath with paiicamrta 
after bowing lsB(1 « to Yasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradynmna, 
Aniraddha, Vjsnu, Sridbara. On the 2nd day of the Pauca- 
tlrthi rites (i. e. 4th day from entering Gaya) the pilgrim should 
repair to Dharmaranya which is so-called because Dharma per- 
formed a sacrifice there. Then the pilgrim should bathe in the 
Matangavapl (which is situated in Dharmaranya), then he 
should perform tarpana, sraddha and pindadana at the well 
called BrahmatJrtha and also in the space between Brabma- 
tirtha and Brabmayupa; then bow to Brahma and Dhaim- 
esvara 15M He should bow to the Mahabodhi tree (i. e. the 
sacred pippala) and perform sraddha also underneath it. Agni 
115. 34-37 and Uaradiya (uifcara) 45. 101 refer to these tlrfchas, 
On the third day of the Pancatlrthl rites (i. e. on 5th day from 
entering Gaya) the pilgrim should bathe in Brahmasaras and 
nerform sraddha with pindas between the Brabroakupa 
and the Y5pa (sacrificial post) raised by Brahma when he 
Soimed a sacrifice. By this sraddha the pilgrim saves 
his pitrs. 1 *" He should go r ound the B rah ma-yupa and bow

to Brahma. There are mango trees near Gopraoara establish- 
ed by Brahma. By watering a mango with water from the 
Brahmasaras the pitrs attain moksa. ■ Here follows the verse 
( 'eko munih' &o. ) quoted above ( n 1493 ). Then a bah should 
be offered to Yama and Dharmaraja, then to the two dogs 
of Yama, then he should offer a bali to crows and then bathe 
(in Brahmasaras). This is briefly a summary, of Vayu 111 30- 
4Q. Some of these details are mentioned by Agni 115. 34-40 and 
"Naradtya (uttara) 46. Then on the 4th day of the Panca- 
tlrthl rites (i. e. 6th day from entrance into Gaya, ) the pilgrim 
should take an ordinary bath in the Phalgu and should then 
perf ram araddnas at the several padas on Gayasiras which is 
neat Phalguttitha. Gayasiras extends from KrauficapSda up to 
Phalgutlrtha. Sraddha offered here (on Gayasiras) becomes 
inexhaustible. 1503 Here Adi-Gadadhara abides in the form of 
Visnupada. By performing a sraddha with pindas on Visnu- 
pada ( which is a footprint on a slab deemed to be of Visnu ) 
the pilgrim saves one thousand families and takes them and 
himself to the blissful, inexhaustible and never-ending world of 
Visnu. Then Vayu 111. 47-56 deal with the rewards of 
sraddhas performed at Rudrapada, Brahmapada and 14 other 
padas expressly named by it. 1504 'For whomsoever by name a 
pilgrim offers a pipda on Gayasiras, that man, if in hell, goes to 
heaven and if in heaven he secures moksa.' 

On the 5th day of the Pancattrtm" rites (i. e. the 7th day 
from entering Gaya), the pilgrim should bathe in the sacred 
place called Gadalola.^s By performing sraddha with pindas 
at Gadalola he takes his pitrs and himself to the world of 
Brahma. Then at the A ksayavata he should perform a sraddha

Aksayavata and worship it with a mantra and also bow to 
worship Prapitamaha. Agni 115. 69-73 and Naradlya (uttara) 
chap. 47 aiso refer to these.' ' • 

The Tristhalisetu (p 368} remarks that the above are the 

fixed rites for seven days in Gays, that other tlrthas may be 

visited according to one's convenience if one stays in Goya for 

half a month or a month ; that the sraddba at the Pretasila is to 

he the first and that at the Aksayavata is to be performed at the 

end, 1507 and that although there is variation between the order in 

which tlrthas are to be visited on the several days according to 

the Vayupnraua, the AgnjpurSna and other puranas, yet as the 

Vayupursna is most detailed as regards Gaya rites, the order 

therein should be followed and that one not knowing the order 

may visit the tlrthas in any order isos exoept Pretasila and 

Aksayavata. Gayayatra, chapter 112 of the Vayupurana, refers 

to king Gaya who performed a yajna and who got two boons, 

one about the restoration of the Gaya brahmanas to favour and 

the other that Gayapurl be named after him and who then went 

to Visnuloka, Then it narrates the story of king Vis&U (verses 

7-15) who being sonless performed pindadiina on GayasJrsa and 

thereby saved his three ancestors, got a son and also himself 

went to heaven. Then another story is told (verses 16-20) of a 

deceased person, Who was in the condition of a .prOa, offering 

ontSxth of his property, to a trader and asking him to perform

six Gay§s confer mukti (by worship and pindadana at them)* 
viz. Gayagaja, GaySditya, Gayatrl (tlrtha), Gadadhara, Gaya 
and Gayasiras. 1505 " 

The Agnipurana (chap 116. 1-34) has a long list of tirthas 
at Gaya that is quoted by the Tristballsetu pp, 376-378, which 
are passed over here. 

Though the number of tirthas at Gaya is very large, the 
majority of pilgrims do not visit them all. Visits to three 
places are absolutely necessary for every pilgrim to Gaya, viz. 
Phalgu. river, Visnupada and Aksayavata, at all of which 
worship has to be done with milk, water, flowers, sandalwood 
paste, tStnbula, lighted lamp and pindas to ancestors have to 
be offered. The Visnupada temple is built over the footprint of 
Visnu on the rock to the west of the river Phalgu The old 
town of Gaya was built Tound Visnupada and it is the largest 
and most important temple in Gaya. The footprint (about 16 
inches in Iengtb) deemed to be God Visna's is inside an octa- 
gonal basin plated with silver. Pilgrims of all castes (except 
untouchables) surround the basin and cast their offerings in- 
side the basin, though for a substantial payment the priests 
clear out all people, shut the door for a minute or two and 
allow a very orthodox or a rich person to make bis offerings 
without being disturbed by anyone else There are 45 vels 
(or sacred places) at which the leisured pilgrim may offer 
pmdasm the Gayafrsetra which extends from about five miles 
to the north-west of Old Gaya town to about 7 miles south of it 
Though the ancient Buddhist works and Fa Hien and Hiouen

or about the two hills Ramasila and Pretoria (ride Bengal 
District Gazetteers, vol 13 for GayS p. 66) They are regarded 
as inferior in status to the regular Gayawals. 

One important question on which there is great divergence 
of vieVs amtog the medieval digests is about the ancestors to 
whom srSdu'ha is to' be offered at Gaya, In the Vayu and other 
Puranas it is frequently said that he who performs" srSddha at 
Gaya becomes free from the debt due to the pitrs 1511 or that 
what is offered to the pitrs at Gays, Dharmaprstha, Brahma- 
saras, or on the Gayaslrsa and under the imperishable Vata tree 
becomes inexhaustible. In most of these passages the plural of 
the word 'pitr' is used. Therefore it follows that sraddha is to be 
offered in GayS to three paternal ancestors. And on account of 
a verse attributed to Gautama, 1512 the three male maternal an- 
cestors also are to be offered sraddha. The difference arises with

IV] Ancestors for whom Gava-sraddha is offered 669' 

reference to the wives of these six male paternal and paternal 
ancestors. The Agnipurana proposes an option (115 10) that 
ZLtas in Gayasraddha are nine or twelve. When they are 
tobenine.theiraddhais for three paternal ancestors, three 
male ancestors of the mother and the wives of the latter three 
male ancestors, while there is a separate sraddha for the mother 
paternal grand-mother and paternal great-grandmother. If 
there are to be twelve devatas in Gayasraddha, then all the 
wives of the paternal ancestors and of maternal ancestors 
would be included in one sraddha. Apararka allowed an 
option (asinAgni)inGaya-sraddha. 1 ^ According to the 
Smrtyarthasara 1514 and Hemadri the Anvastaka-sraddha and 
Gayasraddha for the paternal ancestors and that for the wives 
of these (i. e. mother, paternal grandmother &c.) must always 
be separate, but the sraddha for the mother's paternal ancestors 
and their wives should be one (and therefore the devatas will be 
nine). Yatna (verse 80) appears to hold that the mother, 
paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother are 
always to be associated with their respective husbands in 
sraddha. Some held that the devatas of Gayasraddha were 
only six viz the three male paternal ancestors and three male 
maternal ancestors. 1515 The Tri. S ultimately remarks that 
the usage of the country should be the deciding principle The 
Prajapati-smrti (183-184) has some rather contradictory views 
as to when there would be 12 or 9 or 6 devatas in a sraddha. 
When there are twelve devatas, the sankcdpa at the Pretasila- 
sraddha which is the model of all the sraddhas at the other 
sacred spots in Gaya (with suitable modifications) will be as 
noted below. 1516 

It should be noted that there are certain special charac- 
teristics of Gayasraddha. There is no tonsure (Vayu 83. 18

not other brahmanas, however learned they may be ; one should 
not consider the family or character or learning of Gays 
brahmanas (vide p. 579 above and note 1313). But it has to be 
remembered that Nar&yanabhatta 1517 did not accept this for a]] 
srsddhas t Gays, but only as to the sraddha under the Aisaya. 
vata, since the Vayu (111. 79-80) again refera under Aksaya- 
vata to the worship of Gays brahmanas and since following the 
maxim of 'caturdhikarana* laid down in Jai. Ill 1 26-27 the 
later specific provision narrows down the wide words used in 
the earlier passage. At Gays one could offer pinda to oneself 
but without sesame. 1518 The Tri S. (p 350) observes (relying 
on Vayu) that when a man offers a pinda to laimself, it should 
be in the hands of the image of Janardana on Bhasmakuta" 5 ' 
and that the pilgrim to Gays can offer a pinda to himself only 
when it is certain that he has no son or other adhtlarm for 
offering sraddha. Further, any one related or unrelated, could 
offer a pinda 152 ° to anybody, as laid down in Vayu '"Whether 
it is one's own son or the son of another (who offers), in 
whosesoever name a pinda is let fall at GayS, that man attains 
everlasting Brahma It is desired that anyone may offer a 
pinda to anybody after uttering that person's name and goto 
and the latter reaches the highest goal '

paddhati) published in Bengali characters. Then I consulted two 
ms3. viz the Gaya-sraddha-paddhati of Raghunatha son of 
Msdhava (D. O. ms. Ho. 93 of 1891-95) and the Gay&sraddha-vidhi 
of Vaoaspati (D. G No 245 of 1887-9] ). The procedure in the 
Tirthayatra-tattva of Raghunandaaa is set out here' briefly with- 
out actually citing in full the Vayupurana passages which it 
quotes profusely. Raghunandana appears to follow the TJrtha- 
ointamani closely as some of the notes will show. After the 
pilgrim enters Gaya he should first make an appropriate 
sankalpa 1531 for a bath in Phalgu, take the clay from the river, 
apply it to his body and bathe Then he should perform tarpana 1522 
to the twelve male and female ancestors (specified in note 1516 
above) Then he should declare a sankalpa that he would per- 
form Gayasraddha with the words 'Om ! adyetyadi Gayatirtha- 
prapti-nimittaka-sraddhamaham karisye'. Then, he should per- 
form a parvana-iraddha (described above pp. 485-505) excepting 
the avShana and arghya rites If the pilgrim be unable to per- 
form all the details of sraddha, he may offer only pindas. Then 
on the same day he should go to the Pretasila which adjoins 
the west bank of the river Phalgu and is to the north of Gaya 
and perform sraddha there as follows : he should perform the 
purification of the ground, sit down on it, perform acamana, face 
the south, wear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, recite the 
verses (Vayu 110 10-12 'Kavyavalo...graddhenanenasasvatIm), 
contemplate on his pitrs, perform pranayama, sprinkle water on 
the materials for sraddha after remembering Pundarlkaksa 
(Visnu), make the sankalpa (set out in note 1516). He should 
go through the whole procedure of sraddha up to the payment 
of daksina to brahmanas. After this he should sit to the south 
of the altar (where he performed the sraddha), should wear the 
sacred thread in the apammja form, face the south, place on the 
ground three kusas and after reciting the mantra ( Vayu 110. 
10-13 ) should make an invocation once in the form of offering 
an aiijalt of water mixed with sesame, then honour the father 
withparfi/o (water for washing the feet ), recite the two verses

offer one pinda made of one handful of barley flour mixed with 
Sesame, Mas, ghee, curds, water and honey to all the twelve 
devatas ( ancestors ) together. Then follows what is called 
Sogaiikarma, which is as follows. Nineteen spots for pinda? 
should be made (each to the south of the preceding) and 
should be smeared with pancagavya one after another; than he 
should spread over eaohkusas with their tips to the south, 
should invoke on the kusias the persons intended with the 
mantras { Vayu 110. 30-32 ' asmat-kule mrfca... tilodakaih '), 
should worship them by offering sandalwood paste and the rest, 
( and if he is performing the rite of sodasl on a spot saored to 
a specific deity then worship that deity also with an appropriate 
mantra ), should then offer onoe as before an afljcdi of water 
mixed with sesame - and offer pindas beginning from the first 
spot, each pinda being offered after reciting each of the 19 
mantras ( Vayu 110. 34-55, omitting 110.44 'asipatra o', 110. 4fi 
' anekayatana-samsthah ye ntta o ', and treating 52-53 as one 
mantra and 54-55 as one mantra) 15226 . He should offer 19 pindas 

1522 a It should be noted that om is to be recited before each verse 
intended as mantra here and below. 

1522 b, TheTIr C. (pp 290-292) slightly differs. It does incite 
Vayu 110, 46 and treats the three verses (Vayu 110 51-53 ) as one mantra 
It is difficnlt to understand why the writers of digests did not say that the 
sraddhasodasi should be performed with only 18 mantras from out of the 21 or 
22 verses with option to the reciter. Where the mantras exceed line nnabx 
reoulrea, Javmvai X. 5 14 states 'arprS g WTO f**^ CTfmftmwfWia;.' 
Earfamandana reads the five verses (51-55) somewhat differently from 
,be printed Vayuporana, thongh the sense is not much affected. ■ 



IV] Baghunaivdana's procedure of GayH-sraddha 673 

of the eke already stated and made of the material already 
mentioned with the sacred thread in the apasavya form. Raghu- 
nandana explains that although there are nineteen pindas still 
this is called sraddhasodasl as a technical term. 1553 It would be 
noticed that all the mantras refer to males in the words 'ye', 'te', 
'tebhyah'. So thiB is 'Purivsodasi.' There is a ' stri-sodasi ' also 
which only involves changing the words of the mantras in 
the masculine to words in the feminine gender as indicated in 
the Vayupurana itself. 1Mt Otherwise there is no difference 
between the two ( pumso&asi and strlsodasl ). The note below 
states the mode in which both males and females are to be 
invoked and gratified. 

Water should be sprinkled over all pindas three times with 
a vessel full of water mixed with sesame. The mantras repeated 
at the time aTe quoted below in the note. 1 '^ Then he prostrates 
himself on the ground and should dismiss (send away) them 
(the parsons invoked) with the words 'O father and others I 
forgive me.' Then wearing the sacred thread in the savya form, 
he should sip water (perform acamana) and recite with his face 
to the east the two mantras ("Vayu 110. 59-60 'saksinah santu * 
and 'agatosou Gayam 1 ). If a pilgrim is unable to carry out 
all tins lengthy procedure, he should at least offer pindas on 
Pretasila, fay making a sankalpa (like the one in note 1516 
saying 'pindadsnam' for sraddham'). He should wear the 
sacred thread in the apasavya mode and repeat the verses in 
Vayu (UO. 10-12 and 110. 59-60) and should perform according 
to ha aura Ha various items such as drawing lines on the 
altar meant for placing pindas, spreading kusas, sprinklimr

Then the pilgrim should descend from the hill (PretasiR) 
to the'ground below and should bathe in the deep poo] well- 
known as Ramatlrtha 1S2S (which is in the form d! Probhasn- 
hrada) at the meeting place of the great river (Phalgu) with the 
Prabhasa hill after making a sankalpa (as given in the foot- 
note) and after repeating the mantra ' janmantarasatam ' 
(Vayu 108 18). He should then perform tarpana and perform 
sraddha or (if unable to offer sraddha) offer only pindns accord- 
ing to the procedure of his own grhyasutra. He should offer 
as done in the Pretasila sraddha twelve pindas to the father 
and the others, the single inexhaustible pinda and the sodnsi- 
pwdas Tf he cannot go through all these,' he may perform any 
one of them. Then he should make a sankalpa ana should offer

When a pilgrim performs this bath, sraddha andpindadanahfe

IV] Gaya-baddhas on Slid and 3rd days 6^5 

The sraddha performed here is believed to be performed on the 
altar of Brahma (i. e. where Brahma performed his Asvamedha). 
Then he should with the face to the -south throw on Pretapax- 
vata barley grains mixed with sesame with the mantra *ye keoit' 
(Vayu 110 63 q both by Tir. O. p. 297 and by Raghunandana) 
and offer an anjali of water mixed with sesame with the mantra 
•a-brahma' (Vayu 110.64)." 28 

On the third day after entering Gaya, come the rites of 
Paficatirthl described above,(pp. 663-666). The pilgrim bathes«» 
in the Uttaramanasa with the mantra 'uttaTe manase 
snanam' (Vayu 111. 2-3). He should offer one afijali with the 
verses (Vayu 110. 20-21) and perform sraddha. After this 
sraddha he sits to the south of TJttara-manasa, spreads kusas 
with tips towards the south, offers water with sesame and offers 
to all together one pinda of one handful of barley flour mixed 
with sesame, kusas, honey, curds and water Then he bows 
to and worships the Sun's image on Uttaramanasa with the 
mantra 'namostu bhanave' (Vayu 111 5). Then he repairs to 
Daksinamanasa in silence and there takes a bath in TJdlcI 
tirtha, in Kanakhala and then in Daksinamanasa with the 
mantra (Vayu 111 9-10) and then performs salutation and 
worship to Daksinarka, then makes a bow to Mauntrka, then 
goes to Phalgu tirtha situated to the east of Gadadhara and 
takes a bath and performs tarpana and sraddha there ; then he 
worships Pitamaha (with Vayu 111. 19), visits Gadadhara and 
worships (with Vayu 111.21), then again goes to the five tlrthas, 
at each of which he bathes and performs tarpana Then he 
bathes the image of- Gadadhara with pancamrta. Raghu- 
nandana notes that the bathing of Gadadhara with pancamrta 
is obligatory, while the rest may be done according to one's 
ability. This finishes the rites of paficatlrthl. 

The various tlrthas to be visited after Pancatirthi have 
been mentioned above It is not necessary to repeat them here. 
The special mantras from the Vayupurana cited by Raghu- 

1528 It may be stated once for all that there is a sanfcalpa appropriate 
to each bath, that a bath id a sacred place is followed by tarpana, that 
sraddha is performed as on PrctastlS wrth all details beginning from 
invocation and ending with making the gods bear witness Therefore these 
items will not be repeated hereafter and only the special provisions in each- 
case will be pointed out ' J __

nandana will alone be specified here. After bath and sraddlm 
at Matangavapl, the pilgrim should go to Matangesa to the 
north of Matangavapl and ieoite Vayu 111. 25 (pramanam 
devatah santu &c ). When pouring water at the root of the 
mango tree established by Brahma the pilgrim repeats Vayn 
111. 36 (amram brahma-saTodbhutam &o.). When bowing to 
Brahma, the mantra is Vayu 111. 34 (namo brahmane &c). 
The bali to Yaina is offered with Vayu 111. 38 (Yamaraja- 
dharmarajau &c). The bali to the two dogs is to be given with 
the mantra (Vayu 111. 39) and that to the crows with Vayu 
111^ 40 (Aindra-varuna-vayavya &o ). As regards the padas 
the pilgrim should begin with Rudrapada and perform sraddha 
there and then proceed to Visnnpada and worship Visnu with five 
upacaras 1530 with the mantra 'Idam Visnur-vi oakrame'fftg.I. 
22. 17). To the south of the vedl of Visnupada he should perform 
the sraddhasodasi (described above pp 672-673) up to Vayu 110. 
60 (anrnosham-rnatrayat). About an ascetic, vide above p. 655* 

Then Raghunandana briefly touches upon the sraddhas to 
be performed at the several padas and remarks that the last 
sraddha at the padas is that at Kasyapapada. He prescribes 
Vayu 113. 76 as the mantra for bath in Gadalola-tlrtha. Thsu 
he states that the sraddha at the Aksayavata is to be performed 
on the north side of the Vata near its bottom. He prescribes 
Vayu 111. 82-83 ( ekarnave &c ) as the mantras for bowing to 
the Aksayavata Further, he speaks of sraddhas to be performed 
at several sub-tlrthas, such as Gayatri, SarasvatI, Visalg, the 
hermitage of Bharata, Mundaprstha. Then he prescribes that 
the pilgrim should cross the Vaitaranl (situated to the east of 
the DevanadI which is near Bhasmakuta) with the mantra 
(Vayu 105. 44, yasau Vaitaranl nama &c ). After referring to 
several other tlrthas such as Gopracara, Ghrtakulya, Madhu- 
kulyS, Raghunandana recommends that the pilgrim should 
Visit Pandusila (which is in Campakavana near Pitamaha) and 
perform sraddha there He notes that the four rivers and streams 
called Ghrtakulya, Madhukulya, Devika and MahanadI 
(Phalgu) are called Madhusrava when they meet the SilS (Vayu

112.30) and a bath, tarpana and sraddha thereon yield immense 
results. Then ate mentioned several other tirthas such as 
Dasasvaraedha, Matangapada, Mafcha-fcnnda (near Udyanta 
parvata), Gayakuta. Raghunandana winds up by providing 
that on Bhasmakuta the pilgrim should place with his right 
hand in the hand of Janardana a pinda mixed with curds ( but 
without sesame ) and on doing so recite five verses (Vayu 108. 
86-90, 1532 'esa pindo maya' &c). Then Raghunandana quotes 
"sixteen verses about Matrsodasi (which do not occur in "Vayu- 
purana and are passed over here), 

"We have to distinguish between Gayaksetra, Gaya, and 
Gayasiras or Gayaslrsa. The Vayu, Agni and Naradlya all 
assert that Gayaksetra is five krosas 1533 (in extent) and Gaya- 
siras is one krosa. It had become the fashion to speak of famous 
tirthas like KasI and Prayaga as pancakrosa. But so far as the 
VSyupurana is concerned the Gayaksetra is about 13 miles in 
length from Pretasila to Mahabodhi tree as shown above Gaya 
is said to be two krosas and a half in extent in all directions 
from Mundaprstha 153 *. Gayasiras is smaller than Gaya and is 
identified with Phalgutirtha (vide note 1499). Gaya and 
Gayaslsa (Fan for Gayasiraa) are well known to ancient 
Buddhist texts (Mahavagga I 21. 1 in S. B. E. XIII p. 136, 
Anguttaranikaya, text vol IV. p. 303). Vide n. 1510 

Four of the most important and holy tirthas have been 
dealt with at some length so far. It is not possible in the space 
allotted to the motion on tirthas to pursue the same procedure 
as regards other famous tirthas. It is proposed to devote a few 
pages to each of half a dozen or more tirthas and then to give 
a somewhat comprehensive list of tirthas with a few references 
m the case of each. But before proceeding further reference 
must be made to certain popular groupings of tirthas There 
is a group of seven cities that are deemed to be very holy and

CHAPTER XV 

KURUKSETRA ASTD SOME OTHER FAMOUS 
TIRTHAS 

KURUKSETRA (25 miles east of Ambala) b averv 

quity. In the Eg TO da X.33.4 there fe a reference to a king 
Kurusravana.son of Trasadasyu.iKS The Atharva-veda men! 
bom a Kauravya husband (probably a king) who had a talk 
With h JS wife «» In the times of the Brahmanas Kuruksetrahad 
become a very holy land. The Sat. Br. (IV. 1.5. 13) narrates 
the legend that the gods performed a sacrifice in Kuruksetra 
and at first excluded the two Asvins from any share in it 
(S. B. E vol 36 p. 375). The Maitrayanl Samhita (H. 1. 4., devS 
vai sattramSsata Kuruksetre) and the Tai. Br. (V. 1. 1., deva vai 
sattram-Ssata teaam Kuruksetram vedir-SsIfc) also say that the 
Gods performed asattra in Kuruksetra. The idea underlying 
these passage? appears to be this. The Vedic people of the 
Brahmana period held yaffias to be thedharmajDar excellence, 
as stated in B.g. X. 90. 16 (yajfiena yajnam-ayajanta devastam 
dhatmani pratharaanyasan). Kuruksetra was the centre of 
Vedic culture in the Brahmana period and sacrifices must haw 
been performed there on a large scale. Hence it was called 
dharmaksetra and as gods were supposed to have attained their 
position by what men believed to be dharma (ijajfia, tapas &e.) 
it is stated that gods performed sattras in Kuiuksetra. The 
same Brahmana mentions a Kauravya king Bahlika Pratipiya 
(XII 9. 3. 3, S. B, B. vol. 44 p. 369). The Tai. Br. (t S. 4. 1) 
informs us that the Kuru-Paficalas went towards the east in 
winter (iihra) and to the west in summer which was the worst 
season. The references in the Ait. Br. are far more instructive. 
The legend about Kavasa in which SarasvatI helps the saga 
has already been referred to above (p. 559 n. 1254). The Ait. Br. 
(8. 1 or H 19) calls that place, where SarasvatI came rushing, 
•Parisaraka'. In another place the Ait. Br. tells us that in its 
time Nyagrodha (Ficus India) was called Nyubja in Kuru-

IV ] Ancient references to KuruKsetra 681 - 

ksetra. 1548 Elsewhere the Ait. Br. speaks of the countries of 
the Kurus and Paficalas together with the Vasa-Uslnaras (38. 
3=VHL 14). The Tai £.. narrates ml that the gods performed- 
a sattra and Kuruksetra was their altar (for the sattra). The 
southern side of that Vedi (i. e. Kuruksetra) was" Khandava, the 
northern side was Turghna, the hinder part was ParSnah, and 
the country of Maru (desert) was the .rubbish pit. This shows 
that Khandava, Turghna and Parinah were horder parts of 
Kuruksetra and the Mara district was somewhat away from 
Kuruksetra. The Srantasutras of Asv. XII 6, Latyayana X. 
15 ft and Katyayana KK 34 6 5 ff closely follow Tandya and 
other Brahman as and mention several holy places at which 
parts of the SaTasvata sattraa were performed such as Plaksa 
Prasravana where Sarasvatt starts, the Yaitandhava-hrada of 
Sarasvati, the tract called PaTinah in Kuruksetra, Yamuna 
flowing through the country of Karapacava and the country of 
TriplaksaTaharaD a. 

In the.Chandogya Upanisad (J. 10. 1 ff) occurs the story of 
Usasti Cakrayana who, when the Kuru country was struck by' 
hailstorms, lived with his very young wife in Ibhyagrama and 
went begging for food. 

The Nirukta (H.1Q) explains that 1M3 Devapi and Santanu 
mentioned in Rgveda X. 98. 5 ana 7 were historical persons 
and were brothers, sons of p»stisena, a king of Kuru. Panini 
(IV. 1. 151 and IT. 1 173) explains the formation of the word 
Kauravya from -'Kuru', the first in the sense of 'apatya', the 
second in the sense of 'king,' 1SH

to have asked of Indra the boon that the territory he ploughed 
might be 'Dharmafcsetra' (domain of righteousness) and that 
those who may bathe or die there may reap a rich harvest of 
merit ls49 . The -war between Kurus and Pandavas was fought 
there. It is spoken of as 'Dharmaksetra' in the opening verse 
of the Bhagavad-glta. Kurujangala is said to be a very fit 
country for sraddha in Yayu (77. 93) and Kiinna IL 20. 33 and 
37. 36-37. In the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen 
Thsang speaks of the country, the capital of which was Sthan- 
vlsvara (modern Thanesar which is the heart of Kuruksetra) as 
the 'land of religious merit' (Beal's B. B. W. W. vol. I p. 184). 

The extent of Kuruksatra is said to be five yojanas in 
radius (in Yanaparva . and the YamanaPurana) ass0 . A some- 
what corrupt verse occurs in the Mahabharata and some 
puranas Kil about the limits of Kuruksetra viz. the territory 
between Tarantu and Karantuka and between Macakruka 
(image of a yaksa) and the Bama-hradas (pools made by Para- 
surama) — this is Kuruksetra, Samantapancaka and the nor- 
thern vedi of Brahma, The result is that Kuruksetra is referr- 
ed to Under various names viz. Brahmasaras, Bamahrada, 
Samantapancaka, Yinasana, SannihatI (vide T. Pr. p. 463), 
For the boundaries of Kuruksetra, vide Cunningham's A S. B. 
of India, vol. XIV pp 86-106 where he notes that Kuruksetra 
was 30 miles to the south of Ambala and 40 miles to the north 
of Panipat. In the remote past Kuruksetra was the centre of

all the activities and the culture of the Vedic people. Gradually 
the Vedic people spread towards the east and south and the 
country "between the Ganges and Jumna and later on Videha 
(or Mithila) became the centres of Indian culture. 

For reasons of space it is not possible to dwell at length on 
the greatness and sanctity of Kuruksetra as described in the 
Mahabharata and the Puranas Vanaparva 83 starts by say- 
ing that all beings that are in Kuruksetra are freed from all 
sins and that he also who always says 'I shall go to Kuru- 
ksetra, and I shall reside in Kuruksetra' is freed from sins 1552 . 
'In this world there is no place holier than this. Even the 
particles of dust driven from Kuraksetra by the wind take a 
great sinner to the highest goal' ISB Even the Ganges is com- 
pared to Kuruksetra (vide note 1334 'Kuraksetrasama Ganga*). 
The Naradiya avers 1SH that planets, constellations and stars 
are subject to the danger of falling down (from the sky) in 
course of time, but in the case of those that die in Kuruksetra 
there is no, falling on the earth again (i e. they would not be 
horn again ), 

It is a remarkable fact that though the Vanaparva in 
chap 83 enumerates several Mrfchas on the Sarasvatt and in 
Kumksetra, they do not at .all tally with the Mrthas mentmned

which Kuru stayed as an ascetic. AG (pp. 334-335 ) 
remarks that the lake is 3546 feet long east to west and 
1900 feet wide north to south. The Vamanapurana (22. 
50-55) describes it at some length and says that it was half 
a yojana in extent. Cakratlrtha (mentioned by Vamanapurana 
42. 5, 57. 89 and Bl. 3) is popularly supposed to be the place 
where Krsna took up the discus for attacking Bhlsma. Vyasas- 
thali 1555 (named in Vanaparva 84 96, Waradlya, uttarardha 
65. 83 and Padma I 26. 90-91) is the same as modern Basthali, 
17 miles to the south-west of Thanes ar where Vyasa resolved 
•to 'die on the loss of his son. Asthipura ( Padma, Adi 
27. 62) is on the west of Thanesar and south of Aujasa- 
ghat where the bodies of the warriors killed in the Great 
Bharata war were cremated. Cunningham in Archaeological 
Survey Reports of India vol. IX p. 219 states that Cakratlrtha 
is the same as Asthipura and that in Alberuni's time it was the 
most famous shrine in Kuruksetra. Prthudaka on th3 Saras- 
vati is very highly spoken of in Vanaparva 83. 142-149. 
'They say 1556 that Kuruksetra is holy, that SarasvatI is holier 
than Kuruksetra, that the sacred spots (on SarasvatI) are holier 
than the river SarasvatI and that Prthudaka is holier than all 
the other tlrthas on SarasvatI. There is no tlrtha that is better 
than Prthudaka'. The Salyaparva 1557 remarks that whoever, while 
intently engaged in repeating holy texts, abandons his life at 
Prthudaka on the northern bank of the SarasvatI would not be 
troubled by death next day (i. e. he would be free from birth 
and death) The Vamanapurana (39. 20 and 23) calls it Brahma- 
yonitlrtha. Pithudaka is modern Pehova in the Karnal Dist- 
rict in Panjab, 14 miles to the west of Thanesar. Vide E. I.

built at Prtbudaka. 

The Vamanapurana (34. 3 ff) and Natadiya (uttarardha 65. 
4-7} enumerate seven forests existing in Kuruksetra as very 
holy and as destroyers of all sins, viz. KSmyaka, Aditivana, 
VySsavana, Phalaklvana, Suryavana, Madhuvana and Sita- 
vana. Vide A. S. R. for India, vol. 14 pp. 90-91 for the vanas. 
In the Salyaparva (chap. 38) it is said that the world is encom- 
passed by seven Sarasvatls, then they are enumerated and their 
locations are specified viz, Suprabha (in Puskara, where 
Brahma engaged in a great sacrifice remembered her, verse 13), 
Kaficanaksl (in the Naimisa forest, v. 19), Visals (invoked by 
Gaya in the Gaya country, verses 20-21), ManoramS (in

by Vasistha in Kuruksetra, verses 27-28), Vimaloda (when 
Brahma again performed ayajSa in the Himalaya). In the

to rest on firm ground. It is stated in the Anguttaranikaya 
(1 167 ekam samayam ayasma Mahakaccano Madburayam' 
viharati Gundavane) and Majjhima (H. 84 same words) that 
Mahakaccayana, a famous disciple of Buddha, assiduously 
preached in Mathura the principles of his Master. Megas 
thenes appears to have known Mathura and its connection with 
Heracles 1558 (Hari-Krsna ? ). The word 'Mathura' (meaning a 
resident of Mathura, or horn in or coming from Mathura) 
occurs in Jaimini's Purva-mlmansa-sutra. 1559 Though Panini's 
sutras do nbt expressly mention Mathura, the latter is included 
in the Varanadi-gana (Pan. IV. 2. 82), Panini is, however, 
aware of Vasudeva and Arjuna (IV. 3. 98), the Andhaka and 
Visni elans of Yadavas to which Krsna helonged (IV. 1.114) 
and probably knew the name Govinda (HI. 1. 138 and varfcika 
"gavi ca vindeh safqiiayam'). Mathura is several times mention- 
ed by the Mahabhasya of Patafijali who 156D in a famous passage 
refers to dramatic representations, paintings and stories which 
depict the destruction of Kamsa by Vasudeva. He also cites a 
quarter of a verse about the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva as 
a well-known past event. Whether the town Saurya mentioned 
in the Mahabhasya on Vartika 2 on Panini H. 4.7 (Sauryam 
ca Ketavata oa Saurya-Ketavate) is the same as Mathura is 
doubtful, even though the TJttaradhyayanasutra speaks of 
Mathura as Sauryapura (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 112). The Adiparva 
(221. 46) indicates that Mathura was famed for excellent cows 

1558. Vide McCnndle's ' Megasthenes and Arrian' p. 201 -where it is 
said that Heracles was held in special honour by the Saurasenoi tribe 
(Surasena) which possessed two large cities, Mathura and Kleisobora 
(Krsnapura? ), while Ptolemy calls it "Modoura of the gods' (vide Mc-

ill those days. When Haihsa and Dimbhaka, brave command- 
ers of Jarasandba, drowned themselves in the Jumna and when 
Jarasandha sorrowfully went to Magadha Krsna says 'we shall 
again joyfully reside in Mathura' (Sabhsparva 14. 41-45). 
Ultimately Krsna is said to have left Mathura owing to the 
constant attacks of Jarasandha and established the Yadavas in 
Dv5rakg«* 1 (Sabhaparva, 14. 49-50 and 67). The Biahma- 
purana, on the other hand, states that the Vrsnis and Andha- 
kas on the advice of Krsna left Mathura through the fear of 
Kalayavana. Tide also Vi. V. 33. 8-15. The Vayu (88. 185) 
states that Satrughna, the brother of Bama, killed the demon 
Lavana, son of Madhu and established Mathura in Madhuvana 
while the Ramayana (Uttara-kanda 70. 6-9) informs us that 
Slatrughna took twelve years to make Mathura a fine aaa pros- 
perous city. . In the Ghata-jataka (Fausboll, vol IV. pp. 79-89 
No. 454) Mathura is called Uttara Madhura (to distinguish it 
from. Madhura of the Fandyas in the south) and the story of 
Kamsa and Vasudeva is narrated, which differs in some 
material points from the MahSbharata and the Furanas In the 
Raghuvamsa XV.28it is mentioned as Madhura and as founded 
by Satrughna. Hiouen Thsang states that in Mathura

IV] Inscriptions on Mathura 689 

Inscriptions of suoh Kusana rulers as Kaniska, Huviska and 
others relating to Mathura have been published of which the 
following may ba mentioned: Inscription on a Naga image at 
Mathura of 'Maharaja-rajatiraja Kanikkha' in samvat 8 (E T. vol. 
17. p. 10) M63 ; the Mathura pedestal Inscription of Kaniska in 
the 14th year (E. 1 vol. 19 p. 96); inscription on the pedestal of 
the image of a seated Bodbisattva at Mathura in the reign of 
Huviska in sai'nvat 33 (E L vol. 8 pp. 181-182) ; Inscription of 
a king Vasu (rest of the name lost) of the year 74 (E. I. vol. 9 
p. 241) and of the time of Sondasa (E. X vol. 9 p. 246) ; seven 
Brahml inscriptions from Mathura and its vicinity (E.I. vol. 
24 pp. 194-210) There is further an interesting inscription 
recording the dedication of a stone slab in the temple of 
Nagendra Dadhikama by Nandibala and other sons of some 
aotor (Sailalaka) brothers of Mathura (E. L vol. L at p. 390). 
Erom the Visnu-purana VL 8. 31 it follows that an image of Hari 
had been installed in Mathura before that purana was composed. 
The Yayupurana" 64 informs us in a prophetic vein that seven 
Naga kings will rule over Mathura, Prayaga, Saketa and 
Magadha before the Guptas. Alberuni's India (vol. n. p. 147) 
states that Mafaura (Mathura) is crowded with brahmanas." 

From the above brief historical sketch it would appear 
that Mathura was, five or six centuries before Christ, a flourish- 
ing city where the epic Hinduism prevailed, that later on 
Buddhism and Jainism dominated it, that there must have been 
a revival of Hinduism under the Naga and Gupta emperors, that 
in the 7th century A. D„ when Hiouen Thsang wrote, Hinduism 
and Buddhism were equally prominent and that in the 11th 
century A. D. it was completely dominated by the Brahmanic 
iaith.

For want of spaoe only a few verses about Mathura will be 
set oat here. The Padma (Sdikhanda 29. 46-47) says 'Yamuna 
gives moksa when united with MathurS; Yamuna gives 
rise to great merit in Mathura and when united to Mathura it 
bestows devotion to Visnu*. In the VarahapurSna (153. 8, 11) 
Visnu says 'There is no place either in the nether regions or 
on the earth or in mid air as dear to me as Mathura. Mathura 
is a famous fcsetra of mine that confers mufti; no place is to 
me higher than it. It is my birth-place and it is lovely, oom- 
mendable and dear to me'. The Padma says 'Mathuraka is 
a name extremely dear to Visnu'. The Harivamsa contains a 
fine description of Mathura, one verse from which maybe 
quoted here 'Mathura is the hump (L e. the most eminent spot) 
of Madbyadesa, it is simply the abode o[ the goddess of wealth, 
it is the horn (i. e. the most prominent part) of the earth, there 
is nothing like it and it is endowed with abundant wealth 
and agricultural produce \ 1566 

The tract round about Mathura is said to be ZO yojanas 
in extent and the oity of Mathura was in its midst *» The 
Varahapurana and the NSradiya (uttaraidha) chapters 79-80 
mention numerous tlrthas in and about Mathura. It is not 
possible to enumerate them here. A. few important ones will be

jy] Vanas and other holy places 691 

Khadira, MahSvana, Lohajangha, Bilva, Bhandira and 
Vrndavana. There are also 24 upavanas enumerated by Growse 
on 'Mathura' (p. 76) which are not mentioned by the Puranas 
but only by later works. Vrndavana B8 was to the north-west . 
of Mathura on the Yamuna and was five yojanas in extent 
(Visnupurana V. 6. 28-40, Naradiya, uttarardha 80. 6, 8 and 
77). It was the scene of Krsna's adventures and love-making 
The Padma IV. 69 9 speaks of it as a portion of Vaikuntha on 
the earth. The Matsya (13. 38) identifies Radha in Vrndavana 
as Devi Daksayanl. 1569 In Kalidasa's day it had great fame. In 
Raghuvamsa VI, while describing Susena of the Nlpa family, 
king of Surasena, Vrndavana is said to be no less charming 
than Caitraratha, the park of Kubera (verse 50). Then 
there is the Govaidhana 1S70 hill, which Krsna lifted up on. his 
little finger to afford shelter for seven days to the cowherds 
and their cattle against the heavy rains sent down by Indra 
(VismipuTana V. 11. 15-25). It is stated in the Varahapurana 
(164 1) that Govardhana is about two yojanas from Mathura 
to its west. This appears to be tolerably correct as at present 
it is 18 miles from Vrndavana. The Kurma (1. 14 18) says that 
the very ancient king Prfchu performed austerities here. The 
details given in the Hari-vamsa and the Puranas are sometimes 
confused and misleading. For example, in the Harivamsa 
(ViSDuparva 13. 3) it is stated that Talavana is to the north of 
Govardhana on the Yamuna, while it is south-east of Govar- 
dhana Kalidssa refers to the caverns of Govardhana (Raghu- 
vamsa 6. 51). Gokula is the same as Vraja or Mahavana, where

1569. Dey (p, 42) regards the identity of the modern Vrndavana 
which is only 6 miles from Mathura (in the opposite direction toGokala) 
with the ancient Vrndavana described in the Puranas as extremely doubtfnl 
on several groundsj the most cogent being that ancient Vrndavana and 
Mathura appear to have been situated on opposite sides of the Yamuna", 
while modern Vrndavana and Mathura are on the same side of the river 
But the references he gives for this last statement viz Visnupurana 5 18 33 
and BhggavatapuranaX. 39. 34 do not in my opinion bear out what he says. 
The Naradiya (II. SO 6-7) appears to say that Vrndavana is near 
Govardhana and along the Yamuna and NandigrSma

Krsna was brought up in his early childhood by Hand-gopa 
who removed Ms habitation from Qofcula to Vmdavana out of 
fear of what Kamsa might do. The great Vaisnarite saint 
Caitanya visited Vmdavana (Caitanya-carifcamrta canto 19 and 
mb. Act of the drama Caitanyacandrodaya, both by Kavikarna- 
pfira or Paramanandadasa). In the 16th century Ymdavana 
became a centre of Caitanya's bhakti movement owing to th8 
strenuous efforts and learned writings of the Goseaikns of 
Vmdavana, particularly Sanatana, Rupa and JIva. Vide Prof, 
S, K, De's * Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' (1942) pp. 
83-133. Vallabhacarya, who was a contemporary of Caitanya 
founded new Gokula, one mile to the south of MahSvana in 
imitation of the ancient Gokula, Caitanya and Vallabhacarya 
met at Vmdavana (vide Manilal C. Parekh'a work on 
Vallabhacarya p. 161). The old temples of Mathura met the 
same fate at the orders of Aurangzeb as the templeB of 
Banaras. 15 ' 1 

The Sabblparva (319. 33-25) narrates that Jarasandha 
threw his mace from Girivraja (Rajgir in Bihar, the ancient 
capital of Magadha) and it fell in Mathura at the distance 
of 99 yojanas before Krsna and the place where it fell was 
thence called GadavasSna. I have not come across this name 
anywhere else. 

Growse describes in chap. IX pp. WS. the temples of 
Vmdavana and in chap. 21 Govardhana, Barsan, the birth- 
piceof Radha,andSrandgaon. Vide also 'Picturesque India

vol H pp. 99-144, R. D Banerji's 'History of Orissa* (in two 
volumes, 1930), Gazetteer on Purl, vol. XX pp. 409-413. 

There are four most important tlrthas in Orissa, viz. 
Bhuvanesvara (or Cakratirtha), Jagannatha (or Sankha-ksetra), 
Konarka (or Padma-fcsetra), Yajpura or Jajpur (Gadaksetra). 
The first two are still held in high esteem, while the last two 
are altogether neglected. 

Among the Pur3nas, Purushottama-tlrtha is extensively 
dealt with in the Brahma (ohap. 41-70, about 1600 verses), in 
the Brhannaradiya (uttarardha ohap. 52-61, 825 verses). 
Among digests, the Tirtha-cintamani of Vacaspati that devotes 
nearly one-third of the work to Purusottama-tirtba (pp. 53- 
175) and that quotes about 800 verses from the Brahmapurana 
on Purusottama, Raghunandana's Purusottama-tattva (which 
is brief and mostly based on the Brahmapurana) and the 
TIrthaprakasa (pp. 561-594) may be mentioned. It is worthy 
of note that the Kalpataru (composed about 1110-1120 A. D ) 
does not describe Purusofctama-tlrfcha in its Tfrthakanda 
though it speaks of a few little known tlrthas like Lohareala' 
Stutasvamin and Kokamukha. ' 

Raghunandana in his Purusottama-tattva quotes a verse«« 
(winch as i printed is corrupt) from the Rgveda that from 
the context appears to be addressed to some evil spirit fcfaft J« 
and means 'O evil spirit with a wicked looking chin far thJ- 
art -difficult to be killed)! Have recourse to if l£-S 'wood 
m the sea j that has .no connection with human beings anTgo 
to distant lands with it'. Then he states that the AtWa- 
veda has a similar verse. Pr obably following SayanJs inle r - 

first verse is rea Iy Re, x 1SS 3 otA _ <.. _ ••"■■" p aos;. The 



&U Binary b/ Dhannaiastra [%\. 

pretation, Baghunandana connects this ftgveda verse with 
Purusottama, the image of which is>made of wood. 

It would be proper to Bet out as briefly as possible the 

story of Jagannatha contained in the Brahmapurana. In 

Bharatavarsa there is a country called Ondra situated on the 

shores of the southern ocean, which extendB northwards from 

the sea up to Viraja-mandala 1S73 {chap. 28. 1-3), In that 

country there is a holy place, destroyer of sum and bestower 

of muJdi, surrounded on all sides by sand and ten yojanas in 

extent (chap. 48>. 13-14). There is the famous shrine of Puiuso- 

ttama in the country of Utkala the whole of which is very holy 

owing to the favour of the all-pervading Jagannatha (chap, 42. 

35-37). Men who reside in Utkala are blessed like gods since 

Purusottama resides there. Chapters 48 and 44 narrate the story 

of Indradyumna who ruled at Avanti (Ujjayini) inMalava 

(modern Malva). He was a very pious, learned and good king 

who after reading all Vedas, sastras, epics, pnianas and 

Dharmasastras came to the conclusion that VSsudeva was the 

highest Deity, started from his oapital UjjayinI with a vast 

army, servants, priests and artisans and came to the shores of 

the southern sea, saw the ksetra of VSsudeva, ten yojanas 

in breadth and five yojanas in length and encamped there.

jyi Story of Indradyilmna 695 

Indradyumna (where the king bathed at the end of his Asva- 
medha) will be known by the king's name, that whoever took a 
bath once in it would go to Indraloka, and that whoever offered 
pindas on the bank of the pool would save 21 ancestors of his 
family. Then the king established the three images in the 
temple built by him. 1575 The Skandapurana contains a 
Purasottamamahatmya in a sub-section called TJtkalsu-khanda 
in its section Vaisn&va-khanda, where the story of Indra- 
dynmna is given with some variations. 

Stripping this story of the supernatural, it appears 
probable that the holy place Purusottama was called Nllacala 
in very ancient times, that Krsna worship was introduced from 
Northern India at that place, and that three images of wood were 
established in comparatively early times. It may be stated here 
that in the Maitrayanl TTpanisad 1576 an Indradyumna is named 
among a host of cakravartins. The KurmapuTana (H. 35. 27) 
makes a brief and colourless reference to Purusottama (tlrtbam 
Narayanasyanyat-namna tu Purusottamam). Rajendralal 
Mitra ('Antiquities of Orissa') surmises that there were 
three periods in the history of the Purusottama-ksetra, viz. 
early Hindu period, the Buddhist period and the Vaisnava 
period (after the 5th century A. D. when Buddhism began to 
wane). He notices that from about the 7th century A D. consi- 
derable temple records on palm leaves exist, but that the temple 
records f ot the Buddhist period are untrustworthy (p. 104) and 
that there are indications that Purl was probably a place of 
Buddhist sanctuary (p. 107). The indications of the existence 



1575. Vide Hunter's Onssa vol. I, pp. 89-94 for a somewhat differ- 
ent account based on Kapilasamhita, the most important points of which are 
that Visnu shows to Indradyumna as His image a Jog of wood thrown up by 
the ocean, that the images were being fashioned by the divine carpenter, 
that it tias ordered that no one was to see tbem till they were ready and that 
in spite of this, the queen insisted on seeing them when they had been' 
chiselled only op to the waist and when only stems stood in the place of the 
arms for the images of Krsna and Balarama. while the image of Subbadra 
had no arms at all. The present images are to this day in the same condi- 
tion. The images are described by Rajendralal Mitra in •Antiquities of' 
Onssa' II. pp 122-123. The story of 3*3^ occurs in STRifhrJKpT, STtTCrJ 
52 41-93,53-57. 58.1-21, 60-61. <srejfr agrees very closely with the.

Subbadra and Balarama which are hardly found anywhere else 
and which correspond to the three peculiarities of Buddhism 
viz, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of

IV 5 Temple of Jagannatha 697 

temple is situated at the distance of about seven furlongs from 
the sea shore and stands on a mound about 20 feet above the 
level of the surrounding ground, the mound being dignified by 
being called Nilagiri (the blue hill ). There is a large gate-way 
on each side of the enclosure, that on the east being the most 
magnificent On each side of the entrance there is a colossal 
crouching lion and hence the door-way is called simha-dvara 
( lion gate ). 

There are certain peculiar features of the great shrine of 
Jagannatha In the first place, in the court of Jagannatha and 
outside the Lion Gate no distinction of caste 1578 is observed 
Jagannatha is the god of all people. The second special feature 
is that the holy rice cooked as offering to Jagannatha is regard- 
ed as so sanctified that all barriers of caste are transcended, so 
much so that a Purl pTiest will receive the holy food even from 
a low caste Hindu. The feeling is that cooked rice when once 
placed before Jagannatha never ceases to be pure. Hence the 
MaJiaprasada is dried, is taken to all parts of India and at the 
periodical sraddhas among Vaisnavas a grain of this holy rice 
is invariably put on the cake as the most sacred article that can 
be offered to the Manes (vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa*, 
vol. n p 199). The third special feature of Jagannatha is the 
car festival (rathayatra) which is the most important of the 24 
high »»« festivals at Purl. The festival is described at length 
by Hunter in his 'Orissa', vol 1 pp. 131-134 The car festival 
starts on the 2nd day of the bright half of Asadha. The car of ( 
Jagannatha is about 45 feet in height, 35 feet square and is 
supported on 16 wheels of 7 feet diameter with 16 spokes and 
has Garuda as a crest ; the 2nd car is that of Subhadra, which 
is a little smaller than Jagannatha's car, resting on 12 wheels 
with 12 spokes in each and having a padma (lotus) as a crest 
the 3rd car is that of Balarama resting on 14 wheels with 1 4 
spokes in each wheel and has Hanuman for crest. The cars 
are drawn by pilgrims and hired labourers from the temple to 



157S Hunter ,n -Onssa' (vol. r. pp 135-136) notes that only 
21 classes and castes (including Christians and Mahomedans) are excluded 
they being mostly fiesb-eating and an.mal-Iife destroying castes Even the 
washerman and the potter whom Hunter includes in the list are allowed to 
enter the outer court.

the country-lionse of Jagannatha (which is about two miles 
away) amidst the shouts and emotional songs of thousands of 
pilgrims. Owing to the references in English literature to the 
car of Jagannatha it is supposed by many that pilgrims used to 
throw themselves before the ear in a religious frenzy and were 
killed. But there is hardly any truth in these suppositions. 
There might have been a few accidental deaths. Hunter in 
'Orissa' (vol. X pp. 133-34) scouts this idea of suicide under the 
car and Bajendralal observes (in 'Antiquities of Orissa', rol. E 
p 93) 'No Indian divinity has a more unenviable notoriety in 
English Literature than Jagannatha. It is certain, neverthe- 
less, that human conception has never realized a more innocent 
and gentle divinity than Jagannatha and the tenets of his 
votaries are the very reverse of sanguinary or revolting. Never 
was opprobrium more unjustly oast on an inoffensive object 
than in this instance and none merited it less*. On the 10th 
day of the bright half begins the return of the car from the 
country liouse. 

According to Bajendralal Mifcra the oldest temple in Pur! 
is that of Alabukesvara built by LalStendu Kesarl (628-677 
A.D.), the builder of the tower of Bhuvanesvara; the next 
oldest is Markandesvara and next comes the S™« e jf

kings built magnificent temples at BhuvaneSvara (ancient" 
Ekamra), KonSrka and Purl, which are the finest surviving speci- 
mens of North Indian Hindu Architecture. Mitra ( 'Antiquities ' 
of Orissa ' voL H. pp. 109-110 ) and Hunter ( ' Orissa ' vol. I pp. 
100-102 ) note that Ananga-bhlma wanted to eclipse the grand 
tower of Bhuvanesvara and renovated the temple of Jagannatha 
in take 1119 ( i. e. 1198 AD). 1580 

The temple of Jagannatha has an army of attendants 
They are divided into 36 orders and 97 classes. At the head 
was the Ba3a of Khurdha who called himself the ' sweeper of 
Jagannatha ' ( vide Hunter's ' Orissa ', vol I p 128 ). 

As in Banaras, so here also there are five important 
tirthas, 15sl viz. the pool of Markandeya, the Vata tree ( identi- 
fied with Krsna ), Balarama, the sea and Ihdradyumna pool 
A few words may db said here about each. The story of 
Markandeya is narrated in Brahmapurana, chapters 52-56 and 
in Nrsimha-purana 10.21 ff (briefly). In chap. 56. 7&-73 
Visnu asks Markandeya to build a temple of Siva to the north 
of Jagannatha and to construct a sacred pool which thence- 
forward was to become known as ' Markandeya's pool *. The 
Brahmapurana provides that the pilgrim should bathe in 
Markandeya's pool, dip his head thrice, utter a mantra ( chap. 
57. 3-4 ), then he should perform tarpana, go to the temple of 
Siva (called Markandeyesvara ) and worship him with the 
Mulamantra 1582 viz. ' Om namah Srvaya ', then with another 
mantra called Aghora and a Fauranic mantra. The pilgrim 
should, after a bath in Markandeya's pool and visit to the 
temple of Siva, repair to the sacred Vata, circum-ambulate it

noted that the Brahmapurana 15717 expressly states that 
the Tata is Visnu Himself in that form ( nygrodhakrtikam 
Visnum pranipatya ). The Vata is also styled Kalpavrksa 
{ Brahma 57. 12, 60. 18 ). The pilgrim should bow to Garuda 
standing in front of Krsna and then worship Krsna, Sankarsana 
and Subhadra with mantras. The mantras for Sankarsana are 
verses 22-23 of Brahmapurana chap. 57 and that for SubhadrS 
is chap. 57. 58 158 * The mantra to be used in the worship of 
Krsna is either of 12 syllables (om namo bhagavate Vasudevaya) 
or of eight syllables ( om namo Narayanaya ). BrahmapuraDa 
chap. 57 werses 42-51 specify the various rewards of seeing 
Krsna with devotion and wind up by promising moksa lss A 
bath in the sea at Pari is always commendable, but particularly 
on the Full Moon day (Brahma 60.10). Brahma chap. 62 
deals at length with the bath in the sea ( the whole of it except 
one verse being quoted by TIr. C. pp. 126-128 ). The Indra- 
dyumna pool has been mentioned above (pp. 694-95). The 
mlarim has to bathe in the Ihdradyumna pool, perform 
tarlam for gods, sages and pars and offer pmdas to h» 
ancestors (chap 63. 2-5),

eandrodaya 1587 it is styled Gundica at the very beginning. It 
appears that Gundica is the summer house of Jagannatha 
about two miles from the great Temple. The word is probably 
derived fromgitn^t, which means a thick log of wood in Bengali 
and TTriya { vide Mitra's ' Antiquities of Orissa \ vol. II. pp. 
138-139 ) and has reference to the legend of a log of wood that 
Indradyumna found floating in the sea. 

It may be noted that religious suicide at Purusottama is 
referred to in Brahmapurana- 158S 'those who give up their body 
(life) in Purusottama-ksetra after mounting up the Vata tree or 
do so between the Vata and the ocean reach without doubt 
moksa. A. man abandoning life, either intentionally or 
unintentionally, either on his way to Purusottama or in the 
cemetery or in the country house ( of Jagannatha ) or in the 
streets ( of Jagannatha ) or even anywhere else there secures 
moksa. Therefore men desiring moksa should by all means 
give up life at that holy place '.

The great Vaisnava saint, Caitanya, settled permanently 

at Purl in 1515 A. D. at the age of thirty and spent eighteen 

years there till 1533 ( when he died ). He appears to have 

made a great impression on the Gajapati king Prataparudra- 

deva, ruler of Orissa (1497-1540 A. D,), In the drama Caitanya- 

candrodaya of Kavikarnapfira the king is shown to be so anxious 

for meeting the saint that he declares that he would die if the 

gracious glance of the saint did not fall on him. 1999 This 

should be attributed to the inveterate habit of gross exaggeia- 

tion rampant in most Sanskrit writers, particularly amongst 

devotees and followers of great saints. Caitanya came to bo 

worshipped along with Visnu as a deity in Pari and Orissa (vide 

Hunter's ' Orissa ' vol. I. P. 109 ). Ka^fcarnapura in his drama 

( 8th Act ) makes Sarvabhanma say that there is no distinction 

between God Jagannatha and Caitanya the i only drfenmce 

being that JagannStha is 'dlrubrahma' (J^"*"" 

in a wooden image) and Caitanya is 'narabrabma (Godhea 

in human form). 1591 The CaitanyacantSmrta (a poem) ot

NARMADA" 

Next to the Ganges the most sacred rivers of India are the 
Narmada and the GodavarT. A few words about each of these 
may be said here. 

An express reference to the Narmada has not so far been 
traced in the Vedic Literature. The Satapatha Br. (XII 9 3. 1) 
refers to one Revottaras who was a Patava Gakra and sthapati 
(a chief) and whom the Srfijayas expelled (SBE vol. 44 
p.269) is ». Reva is another name for Narmada "« and it is 
possible to say that Revottaras was named after Reva A 
vartika on Fan. IV. 2. 87 derives the word Mahismat (as the 
name of a country) from 'Mahisa*. This is generally identified 
with Mahismati (on the Narmada). So the name Narmada 
was probably known to the author of the Vartikas (about the 
middle of the 4th century B. C ) The Raghuvarhsa VI 43 
speaks of Mahismati as the capital of Anupa on the bank 
of the Reva (i e. Iff armada). 

The Narmada is frequently mentioned in the Mahabharata 
and some of the Puranas. The Matsya (chapters 186-194 554 
verses), Kurma (Uttarardha, chapters 40-42 verses 189) Padma 
Adikhanda (chap 13-23, 739 verses, most of which are the same 
as m the Matsya) deal with greatness of Narmada and the 
tirthas thereon «fa. The Matsya (194.45) and Padma (Adi- 
khanda a .44) state that from the place where the Narmada 
falls into the sea up to the Amara-kantaka mountain (where it 
rises) there are ten crores of sacred places, while the Agni- 
purana(ll3 2) and Kurma H. 40. 13 raise the numbertfeo 
crores and 60 thousand The Naradlya ( uttarardha chap 77)

says (verse 1) that there are 400 principal tirthas on both banks 
of the Narmada, but from Amara-kantaka three orores and a half 
(verses 4 and 27-28). 1S9S The Vanaparva (in chap 188 103 
and cha'p. 222.24) mentions the Narmada along with the Goda- 
varl and other rivers of the south In the same parva (chap. 
89. 1-3) it is stated that the holy Narmada is in the Anarta 
country 1596 , that it is endowed with pnyahgu creepers and 
mango groves, that it has strings of Vanlra fruit, that it flows 
to the west and that all the holy places in the three worlds 
come foT a hath to the Narmada. The Matsya and Padraa 
declare 1597 that the Ganges is holy in Kanakhala, the Saras- 
vatl in Kuruksetra, hut the Narmada is holy everywhere whether 
in a village or in a forest and that the Narmada purifies the 
sinner by its very sight while the waters of the Sarasvatt do 
so by three baths (on three days), of the Yamuna (by baths) in 
seven days and of the Ganges by a single bath The Visnn- 
dharmasutra (85.8) in enumerating a list of tlrthas that are 
eminently fit for sraddha includes the banks of the Nannada 
throughout the whole length among them. The Narmada is 
said 1598 to have started from the body of Rudra which is a poe- 
tic way of saying that itrisesfrom Amarakantakathatissa.d to 
be the abode of God Mahesvara and his spouse (Matsya 188 91).

that the river Narmada has a course of complete 100 yojanas 
and its breadth is two yojanas 1600 . Prof. K. V. Rangaswami 
Aiyangar seizes upon the length of 100 yojanas and says (on 
p. 199 note 4 of his edition of Kalpataru on Tlrtha in G. O. S.) 
that the Matsya is very accurate, since the length of the 
Narmada is now found to t>9 about 800 miles. But he forgets 
that the breadth is said to be two yojanas (i. e. 16 miles on the 
scale for a yojana adopted by him). It is not shown how and 
where (except at the mouth if at all) the Narmada is 16 miles in 
breadth in its long course. Both Matsya and Kurma state that 
the Narmada is (rises) from Amarakantaka which is to the 
western side of the country of Kalinga. 1601 

The Visnupuiana provides that if a man repeats day and 
night and whenever he has to go inside a dark place the mantra 
'Salutation to NaTmadS in the morning 1 salutation to Narmada 
at night' O Narmada 1 salutation to you; save me from 
poisonous serpents' 1602 he has no danger from serpents. 

It is stated in the Kurma and the Matsya that a man who 
commits suicide by entering fire or water or by fasting (on some 
of the tirthas on the Narmada or on Amarakantaka) does not 
return (to this samsara). 1603 

The Narmada is mentioned as Namados by Ptolemy (p. 102). 
One of the earliest inscriptional references to it occurs in the 
Eran stone pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in 165 of Gupta 
era i. e. 484-85 A. D. Vide C. 1. 1, vol. HI at p. 89. 

Several rivers are mentioned as falling into the Narmada 
such as Kapila (on the south bank, Matsya 186. 40, Padma I 
13. 35), Visalya (Matsya 186. 46 = Padma B. 13. 35-39) Erandl 
(Matsya 191. 42-43, Padma 1. 18. 44), Iksu-nadI (Matsya 191 49

Many sub-tlrthas are enumerated, out of which two or three may 
be - mentioned here. One is Mahesvara-tlrtha (i.e. Omkara) 
from where Rudra is said to have burnt down with an arrow 
the three cities of Banasura (Matsya 188. 2 ft, Padma 1 15 2 ft*), 
Sukla-tlrtha (highly praised in Matsya 193. 3 ff about which it 
is said that the rajarst Canakya ms attained perfection there), 
Bhrgutlrtha (at the very 160! sight of which a man becomes free 
from sia, a bath in which leads to heaven and death at which 
ensures non-return to scahsaia ), the Jamadagnya-tlrtha (where 
the N armada 1607 falls into the sea and where Lord Janardana 
secured perfection ). The mountain Amarakantaka is a tlrtha 
tliat dispels all sins including brShmana-murder and it is one 
yojana all round in extent ( Matsya 189. 89, 98 ). The most 
important place on the Naraiada is, however, MahismatI, about 
the exact location of which scholars have differed. The general 
consensus of opinion is that MahismatI is to be identified with 
Omkara Mandhata, an island in the Narmada about iO miles 
south of Indore. It has a long history. Moggaliputta Tissa is 
said in Buddhist works to have sent missionaries to several 
countries in the reign of Asoka ( about 347 B 0. ), one of which 
was sent to Mahisamandala. Dr. Meet in his paper *Mabisa- 
mandala and MahismatI • (in J. R. A. S. for 1910 pp 435-447) 
assigns cogent reasons for identifying Mahisamandala and 
MahismatI. MahismatI was well-known to the Mahabhasya, *»

No mention of Godavan has so far been found in the Vedic 
Literature. In Buddhist works there are traditions about 
B&varl, who was a purohita of Mahakosala and then of Fasenadi, 
who resided in Assaka's territory in the vicinity of Alaka on 
the Godavarl and who is said to have sent several disciples to 
Buddha at Sravasti (vide Suttanipata, S. B. E. vol. X part 2 
pp. 184 and 187). The Vnrtika 'Sankhyaya nadl-godavarl- 
bhyam ca* on Pan. V. 4 75, expressly mentions Godavarl and 
has m view 'Saptagodavara'. The two Epics and Puranas 
contain numerous references to it. The Vanaparva 1609 mentions 
it as a holy river in the south, abounding in gardens and full of 
water and resorted to by hermits performing austerities. The 
Aranyakanda of the Ramayana (13.13 and 21) speaks of the 
country well-known as 'Pancavati* frequented by heids of deer 
which is near the Godavarl and about two yojanas from Agas- 
tya's hermitage. It is in the Brahmapurana that the Godavarl 
and the subsidiary tJrthas on it have been lauded at great 
length in chapters 70-175. The Tlrthasara ( a part of Ursimha- 
prasada) quotes about 60 verses from chapters 89 91 106 107

how Gautama brought the Ganges from the matted hair of Siva 
to Brahmagiri where he had his hermitage and how GaneSa 
helped in the task hy means of anise. The Naradapurana 
(uttarardha 73) narrates that no rain fell for 13 years while 
Gautama practised tapas, that owing to famine all sages came 
to Gautama's hermitage, that he brought Ganga to his hermi- 
tage, that he sowed ssli grains in the morning and reaped the

they have to be passed over from considerations of space. A 
few words must, however, be said about Nasik, Govardbana, 
Pancavatl and Janasthana, Nasik must have existed at least 
200 years before Christ. An Inscription on one piDar of the 
railing at BnaTbut stupa ( about 200 B. O. ) records the gift of 
Goraksita of Nasik, the wife of Vasuka. 161s This is the earliest 
certain historical reference to Nasik discovered so far. 
The Mahabbasya 1617 speaks of Nasikya as a city. The Vayu- 
purana (45.130) mentions Nasikya as a country. The Nasik 
Inscriptions in the Pandulena caves ( Bombay Gazetteer 
vol. 16 pp. 544-639 and B. L vol. VBT pp. 59-96 edited by 
Senart) establish that Nasik was a prosperous place in the 
centuries before and after Christ. Ptolemy (about 150 A. D.) 
mentions Nasika (Ptolemy p. 156). It is not possible for rea- 
sons of space to go into the detailed history of Nasik, its bath- 
ing places and pools, its temples, pilgrimages and rites of 
worship. For these one may consult the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. 
16 (for Nasik District). That volume states that there are about 
60 temples in Nasik (pp, 503-51&) and 16 in Pancavatl and one 
the left bank of the Godavari (pp. 512 ff). But hardly any 
really old temple has survived. In 1680 A D. twenty-five 
temples at Nasik were destroyed by the Deccan Viceroy of 
Aurangzeb Almost all the large temples that adorn Nasik 
were built during the times of the Peshwas of Poona (1750- 
1818). Three temples are specially worthy of mention, viz. the 
the Rsmji temple in Pancavatl and Naro Shankar's temple 
(or Bell temple) on the left bank of the Godavari near the first 
crossing and that of Sundara-nSiayana in Aditwar Petb at

a half of tlrthas that exist in the three worlds come for a bath 
in the Ganga when Jupiter is in Leo and that bathing in the 
BhaglrathI ( every day ) for sixty thousand years ( is equal ) to 
bathing only once in the Godavarl when Jupiter is in the

when a man repairs to the sacred Godavarl in simhastlta year, 
takes a bath and offers tarpana (and sraddha) to his pitrs the 
latter go to heaven if they are in hell and they attain final

KaficI is one of the seven holy cities of India ( vide p. 678 
n. 1535 above ) and one of the most ancient towns in southern 
India If we rely on the tradition recorded by Hiouen Thsang who 
stayed in KaficI about 640 A D. it would follow that Buddha 
frequented the region around Kanclpura and that KaficI had a 
stTipa about 100 feet high built by Asokaraja ( Beal's B. B. 
W. W. voj. n. p. 230 ). Hiouen Thsang informs us that KaficI 
was 30 h ( or about 5^ miles ) in circuit, that in his day there 
were eighty Deva temples and that there were many heretics 
called Nirgranthas ( Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. 3L pp. 228-239 ). 
The next important datum is the mention of Kaficl-puraka 
(resident of Kanclpura) in the Mahabhasya on Vartika 26 to

of the town of KancI where Manimekhalai ultimately attained 
to enlightenment ( vide S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar's ' Mani-

District) devotes pp. 415-482 to Pandharpur. This sacred 
place cannot claim very great antiquity. On the materials so 
far available it is difficult to decide when the shrine of Vithoba 
was "established, but there is sufficient evidence to enable one 
to say that it was certainly in existence in the middle of the 
thirteenth century A. D. 1626 The Padmapurana (Uttara-khanda 
176. 56-58) mentions the image of Vitthala Visnu on the 
bank of the Bhlmarathl.which has only two arms and is called 
Bindu-madhava. The difficulty is about the date of this part 
of the Padmapurana. In my opinion it is a late addition and 
cannot be placed earlier than about 1000 A. D. The modern 
town of Pandharpur lies along the right bank of the Bhlma 
river. The chief temple in P.andharpur is that of Vithoba in 
the centre of that part of the town which is considered holy. 
The Bombay Gazetteer vol." 20 describes at some length (pp. 
417-424) the main temple of Vithoba and its adjoining parts. 
Behind the temple of Vithoba is the temple of Kakhumal, the 
consort of Vithoba. There is a large staff of priests and 
attendants in the temple of Vithoba, the chief of whom are 
those called Badves (who are the most numerous body of the 
staff and who once claimed to be owners of the temple, but who 
are now held to be the trustees and guardians of the temple pro- 
perty and of the god's jewels under a scheme of management 
framed by the High Court of Bombay). 1627 Except the Badves all

the High Court declared that the Badnes are not owners of the temple, idol 
and property and that they are the chief priests, managers, overseers and 
guardians of the idol, the temple and the property belonging thereto and 
that they are bound to keep order and to bid the SevSdhaits perform the 
duties which belong hereditarily to those priests. In Sakharam Bhimajt 
Benare and others versus Gangaram Babaji Badve and others. Printed 
Judgments of the Bombay High Court for 1S96 p. 614, the position set ont 
above was accepted by both sides and a scheme of management -was framed 
by the High Conrt (pp. 649-651) which provided for the creation of a 
Vithoba Fund, for the appointment of a committee of management con- 
sisting of five Badves to be elected every year, for the keeping of accounts 
by the Badves, and for the auditing of these accounts by aDevasthan com- 
mittee and declared that any cash offering exceeding Rs. 500 was not to be 
appropriated by the Badves for their own use, but was to b2 expended 
for ornaments for the image and to be added to the Vithoba fund, if 
not so required.

other attendants are called sevadhans and they are of various 
grades, viss. the pujSrts ( who take the principal part in the 
worship of the God), Benans 16M (who repeat mantras and hymns 
at different services), paricarafcas (who being in a large silver 
dish the water with which the pujari washes the image of the 
God and brings the lamp for waving it hafore the image at the 
evening and night services), hwtdas (who sings generally five 
verses in honour of the god at the morning, evening and night 
services), the dmgrev (who hold a mirror before the God at the 
early morning service after the god has been dressed and before 
the lights are waved), the dwtes (the torch-bearers) who 
hold a lighted torch when the last night ceremonies are over and 
carry the slippers of the god in torch-light processions three 
times a year on the Full Moon days of Asadha and Kartika and 
on the Dam a night), the dange (who stands with a silver or gold- 
plated mace outside the ante-chamber at the morning, evening 
and night services). The goddess Bafchumal has only one set 
of priests known as UtpUls, of whom there are over a hundred 
families.

IV] Yttkoba Image at Pandliarpur 715 

Kantak, the writer of the note on Pandharpur in the Bombay 
Gazetteer vol. 20, Temarks (p. 424) : "The dress and ornament 
of the image belong to a (time) little later than the Guptas, 
probably not later than the 5th or 6th century after Christ. 
As far as is known no other existing Vaisnava temple in India 
has an image of Visnu like the Pandharpur image, but there 
are two similar images of the third century after Christ in the 

Udayagiri brahmanioal caves near Ehilsa Like the Pan- - 

dharpur image these are both standing figures with arms akimbo 
and hands resting on the hips and a conch and discus in the 
hands ". Formerly pilgrims used to embrace the image and 
also touched the feet of the image. But since about 1873 the 
feet alone are allowed to be touched. 

The Bombay Gazetteer (vol. 20 p. 431, note 2) states that 
the image of Yithoba was removed to various places at diffe- 
rent times to save it from sacrilege by fanatic Moslem invaders 
and rulers. About 500 yards east of Vithoba's temple in the 
bed of the Bhlma river is the temple of PuDdlik, one of the 
most favourite places of worship in Pandharpur. This last 
temple is not that of a god. It only marks the spot where 
Pundlik, a great devotee of VitthaJ, spent his last days and died. 
Pundlifc was probably a brahmana from Pandharpur, originally 
an undutiful son who ill-treated his parents, but who later 
repented on seeing the dutiful cobbler Bohidas, changed his 
ways and became a very dutiful son, so much so that tradition 
says that god Vithoba came to visit him. Vitbobs and Pundlik 
have become so much coupled together that all pilgrims before 
beginning to dine and on other occasions shout the crv 
PundaUkavaradeHariVitthar«*>. The Bora. G vol 20 (pp 
432-434) describes the temple of Pundlik and narrates the' 
traditional story about him

JSftff a f d oontwwndal questions arise, in 
Ration to VitboWs tempi* at Pandharpur; vfc the date when 
the image of Vithoba was installed in the temple at Pandharpur, 
whether the present image is an old one or a statute, uhat 
the ancient name of Pandharpur was, the derivabon of tho 
word Vitthal\ As regards the first question itmay be stated 
that there is not enough evidence to establish with certainty 
the time when the image was established 163 » But some of She 
items of evidence may be briefly set out here. In I A. vol, 14 
pp. 68-75 Prof. K B. Pathak published an inscription on a copper- 
plate found at Bendigere (about eleven miles south-east from 
Belgaum), the inscription being dated in iate 1171 {1249 AD), 
in which Pandharpur is called Paundarlkaksefora on the BiUma- 
rathl (at p. 74) and Vithoba is called Visnu and which records 
the grant of a village in Venugrama district (Belgaum) to a 
number of brahmanas by a minister of Ysdava king Krsna (or 
Kanhara in the inscription) in the presence of god Visnu (p. 74) 
i. e. before the image of Visnu or Vitthala. Dr. R. G Bhandarfcar 
in.'Yaisnavism, Saivism&e', (p. 88) and in ' History of the 
Decean' (2nd ed. p. 115-6) refers to ~an inscription on stone 
dated softs 1192 (1270 A. D.) in Pandharpur itself, in which 
. BhSnu, son of Kesava, is represented as having performed the 
AptorySma sacrifice in Pandurangapura 'on account of which 
' crowds and Vitthala were greatly pleased'. There is another 
earlier inscription in the temple of Vithoba on throe sides of a 
stofie beam in a sopg beyond the mandapa (porch) of Ifi pillars, 
- the script being DevanSgarl and the language being partly 
Sanskrit and partly Oanarese. It was issued in saLa 1159 (1237 
A.D) byHoysala king Somesvara and records tho grant of 
an agrahara to God Vitthaladeva who resides in a great village

made the heart of sage (mum) Punlarlka expand (with devotion). 
Vide Bom. G. vol. '20 pp. 419-420 and pp. 4-6 of Mr Khare's 
monograph' (on medieval references). The Mysore Archaeo- 
logical Survey Report for 1929 (pp. 197-210) publishes a copper- 
plate inscription issued by the Rastrakata king Avidheya 
which records a grant of Pandaranga-palli and four other 
villages situated to the east of Mahadeva hill to a brahmana 
named Jayad-vittha. This grant was confirmed about 820 A. D. 
by Rastrakata king Sarvarasa (i. e. Amoghavarsa I). The 
editor Dr. Krishna is of opinion that the date of the inscription 
must be 516 A D. {ibid, p 203). Therefore the important con- 
clusion follows that Pandharpur was known to Oanarese people 
as Pandavage and was also called Pandarangapalli. This in- 
scription does not expressly refer to god Vitthala, but the 
donee's name Jayad-vittha contains the part Vittha which is 
mo3t probably an early form of Yitthala. 

In a work called 'Vitthalabhusana* 1631 by one Gopalacarya 
about eleven verses are quoted from Hemadri on Tlrtha which 
are quoted below 1632 . Briefly they state • an excellent tlrfcha ex-

the whole ksetra resides there. It is three times holier than 
Puskara, six and ten times holier than KedSTa and VarSnasl 
respectively. Pundarika practised severe austerities at the 
end of Dvaparayuga in the 28th Kalpa and always devotedly

his devotion to his parents, Krsna who wields a stick for 
driving cows, who has bracelets rendered bright by (the colour)

Caitanya's visit and 'Sri Yallabhacharya * by Manilal 0. 
Farekh (pp. 56-59 ) for Vallabhacarya's visit. 

It has been already shown from the Bombay Gazetteer that 

there is a tradition about the image having been removed several 

times and brought baok. On pp. 16-35 of his work Mr. Share 

cites various passages from medieval writers in Sanskrit, 

MaTathi and Canarese and comes to the conclusion that -the 

present image is not only not the ancient one but that it was 

not there in the 17th century, since the characteristics of the 

present image do not tally with the description contained in 

the poems of saint Tukaram. I do not agree with his conclusions. 

He has overlooked several weighty considerations. He has 

relied upon inferences drawn from the presence of Af zulkhan 

and the bigoted emperor Aurangzeb in the Deccan. I have cited 

above (pp. 63S, 69B) references to the demolition oE Uorth Indian 

temples and images on the orders of Aurangzeb, but Mr. Ehara 

has been unable to show any direct reference to the demolition 

of the temple or the image of Vithoba on the orders of any 

Moslem king or officer. 1631 We cannot rely on mere inferences 

or not properly authenticated letters or verses. Besides, the 

present image is so much worn that unless one very carefully 

1634, It may, however, be stated that there is some evidence that 
efforts were made to demolish the temple of Vithoba by some Moslem king of 
Bidar and that the Badves ( the guardians of the Pandhan temple } fearing 
destruction of the image removed it and concealed it somewhere else. 
In a Maratbi work called ' HejKl^ePlri.^MI ir&f » by Mr. Narayan Krishna 
Gadre ( 1905 ) p 168 verses are cited from a life { completed in sake 1667 
i e 1745 A D ) of one Changa Mudhesa ( who died in sake 1427 i e 1505 
A.D.) written by his descendant Shamji Gosavi Vaiijarkhede (who was 
lltb in descent from Changa Mudhesa) The Marathi verses are:

that Changadeva thought that the mosqne should be demolished and a new

image of Vitthal at Pandbarpur and that at Tui]apnr. The letter is not

of evidence.

the faota that the arms are akimbo, that there is no dhoti 
(dtgarhbard), and mentions the existence of a stkya, a stick, also 
a girdle. and ornaments. Lastly,, Mr. Khare does not attach 
sufficient importance to two facts, one being that about 1873 two 
Gosavis damaged the image which was later re-installed and 
pilgrims were forbidden from embracing it. It is quite 
possible that some of the features already indistinct were lost in 
these happenings (vide Bom. G. vol. 20 p. 430 ). Besides, for 
hundreds of years the image , has been washed with paficamrta 
,(milk, curds, ghee, honey and sugar) and water at least once 
every day and sometimes several times a day. It is not difficult 
to imagine that the characteristic marks became blurred by 
these continual baths. 

Some other matters require to be dealt with. The image 
is variously called viz. PSnduranga, Pandhari, Vitthal, 
Vitthalanatha and Vithoba. 

Visnu assumes iu Prakrit the forms Vinhu, Vinnu, Venhu, 

Vetha and others. In Oanarese Visnu becomes Bitti.Bittiga, 

Vitta &c. The changes in names do not necessarily follow 

the rules laid down in Prakrit or Oanarese grammars, which 

rules themselves are often based on meagre data and Mr. A. K. 

Priyolkar in his learned paper on 'Bhagat Namdeo of the Sikhs' 

in the Journal of the University of Bombay vol. VH part 2 

(1938) points out (p. 24) that in the Sdi Granth of the Sikhs, in 

the hymns of Namdeo, God is addressed as 'Bithal' or 'Bithalu' 

(p. 24), that, in the Gujarati poems of Narsinh Mehta and 

Mirabai, God is addressed as Vitthala (p 35) and Vitthala is 

employed by these saints meaning only Visnu and not the 

deity at Pandharpur. The learned Kaslnatha Upadhyaya 

author of Vitthala-rn-mantrasara-bhasya, derives the word 

Vitthala as ( Vtt+tha+la) 163S . 

As regards the name of the ksetra it appears that origi- 
nally it was called in Oanarese Pandarage, of which Pandu- 
rangais a sa nskriti Z ed form. When Pundlik, the devotee of 
Vrtthal became famous the sacred place came to be called

Some people think that the image of Vithoba is really 
Buddhist or Jain. There is hardly any evidence for this. When 
such Marathi poets and saints as EkanStha, and TukarSm speak 
of Vithobs as Bauddbavatara they have Visnu in mind," 37 
whose 9th avatara was Buddha according to the Furanas and

adopt towards holy places and'pilgnmages will be briefly dealt 
with at the end of the next chapter on the list of tirthas.

CHAPTER XVI - - 

r - - 

LIST OF TIRTHAS 

This is merely a list of tlrthas from the point of view of 
Dharmasastra and not a treatise on the Ancient Geography 
of India. The result is that many countries and towns that 
have no importance or claims as tlrfchas have been, altogether 
omitted. Bauddha and Jain -works on tlrthas have only rarely 
been referred to Many of the Puranas enumerate the moun- 
tains and rivers of diipas and wxrsas other than those of 
Jambudvlpa and Bharata-varsa such as Harivarsa, Ramyaka- 
varsa, Krauficadvlpa, Salmalidvlpa, but they have been exclud- 
ed from this list. The Brahmapurana ( chap. 26 verses 8-83 ) 
contains a string of over 520 tlrthas without hardly any 
certain indication of their location and the Bhismaparva in 
chap. 9 mentions about 160 rivers with practically no indication 
about their location in mo.st cases Similarly, the Garuda (L 81. 
1-31) enumerates about 200 and Padma j(-Vl 129) contains 108 
tlrtha names. In Banaras alone I have, listed about 350 sub- 
tlrthas. But there are about -1500 shrines and. temples in 
BanaTas alone. These have not. been included. Each great 
tlrtha has numerous sub-tlrthas as in the Varaha-purana under 
Mathura, in Brahma-purana under Gautami, in Vayu-purgna 
under Gays. Through sheer wearineBs or inadvertence some 
of these must have been left out by -me and some were left 
out purposely on account of the absence of any importance 
Besides, several tlrthas that are regarded as sacred by modern 
people are not so treated in the Epics or puranas" and are not 
even mentioned in them; many of these have been omitted in 
this lurt Our authorities are often very vague about the 
location or extent of tlrthas Moreover, a number of -tlrthas

in support of my views. It would look ungrateful to find fault 
with the work of Day; but it must be said that he relies too 
much on rathor old and antiquated authorities and has not 
cast^ his not over a wide area. Often times he mentions no 
original authorities (vjde, for example, CakratTrtha on p. 43). 
Ho is very vague in his references. He hardly ever cites the 
number of the verse on which he relies and often omits to 
specify oven the part or section of the work relied upon. For 
example, at p. 13 as regards Avanti he mentions Panini IV: 176, 
which should bo IV. 1. 176. Further, he has omitted several 
woll-known tlrthas (e. g. Dasasvamedhika). He is sometimes 
wrong in what ho says. On p. 54 he states that Kiskindhs- 
kanda 43 refers to Devadaruvana as a proper name, but there 
the context {'lodhrapadmaka-sandesu devad&cuvanesu oa v in 
vorso 15) shows that what is meant is 'forests of Deodar trees'). 
On p. 73 ho says Bharatavarsa was' first 'called Haimavata- 
varSa, but tho passage of the Lingapurana (I 4d. 7) on which 
ho Telies {idam haimavatam varsamBhsratam n5ma visrutam) 
does not bear that out. There is no reference to a prior account 
hero and all that is meant is that Bharatavarsa is connected 
with Himavat, as a previous passage (I 47. 33 Himadrer- 
daksinam varsam BharatSya nyavedayat) expressly states that 
Bharatavarsa is to the south of Himalaya. t ^™yM 
SarasvatI is called BaimavaU, but that does not mean that 
HaimavatI was the name of SarasvatI infar-oS ages It simply 
moanslha Ut 'rises inHimavat range.' Only a comparison of

Raja-taranginl and his memoir on the Ancient ..Geography >of 
Kashmir published separately (and also embodied in the 2nd 
volume of the translation of Kalhana's work). All the names 
of tlrthas are transliterated 'into the English alphabet .and 
arranged according to the English mode of spelling. . For the 
Mahabharata references are given to the oblong Bombay 
edition and by citing names of parvdns, but in the case of jbhe 
Ramayana Roman figures I to VII are employed for the Bala, 
Ayodhya, Aranya, Kiskindha, Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara 
kandas respectively. For the Ramayana I have used the 
edition brought out by the Madras Law Journal Press in 193S. 
Among Puranas the Anandasrama editions of the Agni, 
Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Matsya, Vayu and Padma have been 
relied upon and as to the rest of the MahSpuianas the Venkate- 
svara Press editions have been used (except in the case > of ,the 
Nrasimhapurana of which the edition ofi Messrs. Gopal 
Narayan & Co. and the Bhagavatapurana, of which the 
JTirnayasagara edition of the bare text have been referred to). 
The Skandapurana has been a source of great trouble and 
labour. Owing to the limited time at my disposal I have not 
been able to digest thoroughly the ninety thousandi and odd 
verses of that purana, though I have very carefully gone into 
the Kasfthanda and some other khandas. Besides, there are 
two separate recensions of the Skanda and large portions of it 
appear to be apocryphal and later additions. The seven big 
sections of the_ Skanda viz Mahesvarakhanda, Vaisnava 
Brahma, Kasl, Avantya, Fggara, Prabhasa are indicated by 
Roman figures from I to VH and the sub-sections by Arabic 
figures. Some of these sub-sections have further sub-divisions 
into Purvardha and Utfcarardha. 

I have made endeavours to locate the tlrthas as far as 

SiiiT "PS" ha 7 J"" dTaWn UP0D in several cases 
for locating the tlrthas and for their antiquities and history

Mata'. This makes no sense. PsrSvaratata would mean 
'the shore of the sea*. "What is really meant is that Devi is 
styled or worshipped as Para on the bank of the -Para river 
(Para Paratate mata). He does not compare the readings of 
the several printed editions of the five puranas. BesideB, the 
information furnished is very meagre. If the whole' had been 

'printed in a compact form far more information could have 

cv been c given in the same number of pages. 

In some places I have indicated the rewards promised for 
bathing in the tlrthas ; but I have not done so in every case. 
The puranas promise one or more of 'the following rewards viz, 
the same merit as the performance of Asvamedha or Ygjapeya 
or other solemn Vedic sacrifices or reaching the highest worlds 
such as those of Brahma, Visnu or Siva, the destruction of the 
^gravest sins such as brahmaua murder, the same merit as 
arises From gifts of a thousand cows &c. 

Many of the doubts and difficulties about the identification 
of several tlrthas can, if at all, be solved only by means of 
actual journeys to various places and investigations on the 
spot. That is a task which would require for its proper accom- 
plishment a team of workers. A single individual can hardly 
' attempt such a task with his own resources. 

This list will, it is hoped, be of some use in elucidating "• 
several problems such as the questions about the relative anti- 
quity of the puranas, the dates of several Sanskrit works which 
mention'the tlrthas and the questions about borrowing on the 
paTt of purabas among themselves and from the Mahabharata.

three miles from Kodinar is sur- 
rounded by tbe xaios of a temple 
which popular Hindu belief declares 
to be tbe original Dvaraka, where 
Kitaarcsided and whence transferred 
himself to Dvaraka in Okhamandala. 
Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. VIII. 
(on Katbiawar) pp. 518-520 for 
Kodinar and p 552forMiilaDvarakI. 
It was fonnded by Krsna (with Rai- 
vataka as a park and Gomanta as a 
hill) owing to constant invasions and 
harassment by JarSsandba; it was 
two yojanas long and one yojana 
broad. Vide Sabhaparva 14. 49-55. 
The Var. (149. 7-8) makes it 10 yoja- 
nas long and 5 broad Vide p 68S 
above under Matbura. B (14. 54-56) 
says that the Vrsnis and Andbakas 
left Matbura through fear of Kalay- 
avana, took counsel with Krsna, ran 
to Kusastbali and bnilt up Dvaraka: 
Vi V. 23. 13-15. B 196 13-15 say 
that Krsna begged of the ocean a 
strip of twelve yojanas, built Dvaraka 
wiib large parks, mansions and 
strong walls and established the 
people of Matbura there. When 
Krsna passed away, the city was 
flooded by the sea and swept away, 
as stated in a prophetic vein by 
Mansala-parva 6.23-24 and 7. 41-42. 
B 210. 55 and 212,9. Vide also Vi. 
V, 33 9 (the whole of Dvaraka except 
Krsna's palace was swept by tbe sea) 
and BV IV. 129. 44 (except Rnkmi- 
ni's palace). It is called the capital of 
Anarta (Udyoga 7. 6) and was first 
called Knsasthalt (Sabha 14, 50) 
Vide M C9.9=P. V. 23. 10, B, 7.29- 
32 and Ag 273. 12 (Kusasthali being 
the earlier name of the capital). The 
present Dvaraka is near Okh* in 
Kathiawar. The Hanvamsa II (Visnu- 
parva) chapters 58 and 98 deal with 
the founding of Dvaraka Some an- 
cient Jain works like the Uttaradhy. 
ayanasutra (SBE. vol. 45 p.115) men- 
tion Dvaraka and Raivataka park 



(Girnar). - The JItabss also refer to 
Dvarafca. VjdeDr.B C. Law's work 
on 'India as described in early texts of 
Buddhism and Jainism' pp. 102,239. 
The Frabhasakbanda of the SK has 
a sub-section on Dvaraka in 44 chap- 
ters and over 2000 verses for the 
glorification of Dvaraka. It says 'the 
reward that is secured by (pilgri- 
mage to) VaranasT, Kuruksetra and 
Narmada can be secured at Dvaraka 
in half a twinkle (4. 52)*; "Pilgri- 
mage to Dvaraka Is the 4tb means 
of mukli. Man secures mukti by 
acquiring correct knowledge about 
Brahman or by dying at Frayaga or 
by mere bstb in Gomati: near Krsna" 
(SK. VII. 4. 4. 97-98 ). The BV. 
( Krsnajanmakhanda, Uttatardha 
chap, 103) has a hyperbolical descrip- 
tion of the creation of Dvaraka, 
, which is said to 'have been one 
hundred yojanas in extent. There 
is a work called Dvaraka-pattalaka 
compiled by Binabayt (the only 
Ms. of which is the one at B O. K I. 
in Poona) which has been published 
by Dr. J B. Chaudhun (1940). The 
Ms is dated samvat 1574 (1518 
A. D ). It summarises tbe Dvaraka- 
mahatmya in SK. A pilgrim on reach- 
ing Dvaraka first worships Ganes, 
then Balarama and then Krsna; bo 
visits Rukmint's temple on the 8th, 
9th or 14th Uthi, then visits Cakra- 
tTrtba, then Dvaraka Gangs, then 
Sankhoddhara, then bathes in the 
Gomati. The temple of Dvaraka- 
aatba is on the north bank of the 
Gomati creek. The main temple has 
five stories, is about 100 feet 
high from the ground and is sur- 
mounted by a conical spire rising 
to about 150 feet. Vide Dr. A. D. 
Pnsalkar's paper in the Dr. B. C. 
Law presentation volume I pp. 218

Dvaraka:

vol I p. 197, where Hionen Thsang 
states that men of the five Indies 
call it the Gate of Ganga and that 
hundreds and thousands of people 
gather to bathe and wash. I do not 
agree with Cunningham (A G. p. 
353 ) that Haridvara is a compara- 
tively modern name, since Albernni 
mentions only Gangadvara Both 
SK IV and P IV mention Haridvara 
and it cannot be said that they both 
are later than Albernni ( i. e 1030 
A D. ). Probably Gangadvara was 
a more popular name in the 11th

KasmTra-mandala — The ancient name 
seems to have been Kas'mTra. The 
Mbb (vol II p. 119) on Pan III. 2 
114 employs this form (abbijanasi 
Devadatta Kasmlran gamisyamah) 
Kasmira as the name of a country 
occurs in the Swdhvadigana 
(Pan. IV. 3. 93). In KM the 
country is called Kas'mTra in many 
verses such as 5, 11, 43, 50, but 
sometimes Kas'mira also Later 
works also like H. C 14 45 employ 
the form Kasmira, the Vik (18 
1 and 18) uses the form Kasmira. 
NM (292-93) derives the name from 
ka meaning water ( kam van Harms 
yasmad-desad-asmad-apHkrtam I Kas-

bhav isyati II) Ptolemy speaks of it as 
Kaspeiria and states that the country

' by the head waters of the VitastS 
and to the minor slopes of moun- 
tams that surround' it. Hjouen 
, Thsang (BeaVs E RWW vol 1. 
p 148) states that "Kasmira kingdom 
is about 7000 h (one /.being equal 
to about 5| miles), that as the 
country ,s protected by a dragon it 
bas always assumed superiority 
among neighbouring people, that 
they love learning and are well 
instructed and that ( p. 149 ) the 
country was once a dragon lake and 
that afterwards it became dry ' 
The words ofHiouen Thsang refer 
to an ancient legend according to 
which Kashmir was originally a lake 
(called Sattsaras) 6 yojanas long and 
3 yojanas wide and later became 
Satides'a (NM 64-66), mat Uma 
herself is the country of Kasmira 
(NM31), that the divine Vilasta 
rising m the Himalayas is like the 
simanta (line parting the hair) of 
this holy land (NM 45) The 
legend runs that Visnn conferred a 
' boon on Vasoki-naga who prayed to 
Visnu when Garuda began to devour 
all nagas that he should stay in the 
Satldesa along with the other nagas, 
that no enemy would kill any naga 
(NM 105-107) and that Nila was made 
king of nagas ta the Satideb'a ( NM 
110 ). The residence of Nila is the 
famous fountain near the village of 
Vernag in the Shahabad patgana. 
A certain demon called Jalodbhava 
grew in the Sati lake and killed men 
(NM 111-123 and Vara. 81 30-33 ) 
Nua approached the sage Kasyapa 
the father of all Nagas, at whose 
intercession Visnu asked Anantanaga 
to pierce the hills and make the 
lake dry and then killed the demon 
Jalodbhava (R 125) ThenVmu 
asked the Nagas to live in peace and 
harmony with men Sati became the

small as a gram of sesamum which 
is not a tirtha and has not a naga

(vol II p 354) Abul Tazl notes 
that there were in his day 45 shrines

Brahma and 22 of Durga and that 
in 700 places there were graicn 
images of snakes which were

- this. It is possible that when the 
Sarasvat! became dried and only a 
marshy bed was left it was called 
Saravati, bat that in the haes of the 
Amarakos'a,' Saravati is probably the 
river Saravati which falls into the 
sea near Honavar ( North Kanara 
District) on which are the famous 
Gcrsappa falls. In the Raghvivaissa

Sarayu— (r ) Rg IV. 30 18, V. 33. 9. 
X 64 9 (SarasvatT, Sarayu and

In all. these places the word is 
Saraju, while in classical Sanskrit 
it is Sarayu or Sarayu (M 22. 19, 
VI 45 94, N II. 75. 71, Raghuvamsa. 
15 95 and 100). M. 121 16-17 and

Ayodhya was situated on the Sarayu 

' (Ram 'II. 49. 15) Sarayu rises from 
Himalaya ( Va 45 94, M 114. 21 ) 

' According to Pan VI, 4 174 (Dandi-

called Sarava (Kas'ika says 'Sarayvam 
bhavam saravam udakam '") In the 
Cullavagga (SBE vol XX p 302} it 
is one of the five great rivers of 
India and in ' Questions of Milinda ' 
(SBE vol 35 p 171 ) it is one of ten 
great rivers, but in both places it 
is written as Sarabhu. Vide T P pp

CONCLUDING REMARKS ON TIETHAS 

At the end of this long list of tlrthas a few words, as 
promised on p. 722 above, must be said about the attitude that 
we Indians of the 20th century should adopt towards the moun- 
tains, rivers and other holy places in Bharata. Modern secular 
education and the prevailing economic conditions, stresses and 
trends leave hardly any loom for moral and spiritual uplift. 
We are surrounded on all sides by anxiety, want, misery, 
hardness of heart and crime. Therefore, the endeavour of all 
those who have the good of our country at heart must be to 
cherish all such institutions as tend to lift the mind out of 
narrowness and to make it concentrate for sometime at least 
on noble thoughts and aspirations and on detachment from the 
all-engrossing pursuit of money. Pilgrimage is one of such 
institutions. Those who have faith in pilgrimages as enabling 
a pilgrim to attain heaven, to collect merit and reach release 
from samsara should give pilgrimages a new orientation, 
should see that their chanty is not wasted on indolent, ignor- 
ant and vicious priests, should improve the methods of worship 
at holy places in such a way as will satisfy all hygiemc 
requirements. The priestly class at holy places should remem- 
ber that in the coming generations they are toy to find 
their occupation gone, unless they improve themselves, unless 
SvtrlSbeTess IS norant and indolent than they are at 

as modern secular education spreads. ™ ™ w magcs to

IV] Concluding remarks on tftlhas 827 

of one parb of Bharata are bound up with the destinies of all 
others, Erequent visits to distant places in Bharata, mixing up 
among people of other parts and understanding their peculiar 
good points, needs and failings is absolutely necessary if we are to 
keep our freedom. India is thrice blest in the mountain ranges of 
theHimalaya.which contains the highest peaks in the world and 
js full of laTge and life-giving rivers and of numerous shrineB 
associated with the names of the greatest sages and heroes of 
antiquity. Every Indian who is proud of the great religious and 
spiritual heritage of our country must make it a point to devote 
some part of his time to frequenting holy mountains, rivers and 
other places of pilgrimage. When we see even from a distance 
the purity, the whiteness and the serenity of the snow-capped 
peaks of the Himalaya, the play of delicate and exquisite hues 
and tints of blue, mauve, and pink when the sun begins to shine 
on them, a sense of wonder, joy and elevation comes upon us. 
The glorious view of a peak like Kinohinjunga, which is an 
unforgettable experience, lifts up the whole life of the onlooker 
to a higher plane for long. Similarly, the sight of the holy 
Ganges at night or at sunrise in Haridvara or on the majestic 
Ghats in Banaras surely empties our minds of meanness and 
for the moment at least fills our hearts with a sense of nature's 
beauty and with purity, and brings us in tune with the Infi- 
nite. I may state here that the talk of the conquest of Everest 
in which some members of European expeditions indulge jars 
on my ears. This great peak has so far vanquished (physically) 
all those who attempted the conquest § But in a figurative 
sense Everest and other high peaks have been for ages conquer- 
ing the hearts of men. Even the members of these expeditions 
will admit that Everest and its brethren have drawn men to 
themselves from all parts of the world, made them give up 
their usual uneventful and placid activities, have evoked in 
those who attempt the climbing of these giants unbelievable 
courage, endurance, resourcefulness and self-abnegation and 
have been instrumental in exhibiting to the world what un- 
known powers the human spirit possesses. Therefore, these silent 
but awe-inspiring peaks should bB looked upon as teachers 
of mankind and not as material things to be conquered and 
dealt with by human beings as they please 



§ While these pages were passing through the Press, news was broad- 
cast on the i cry morning of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II that 
Shcrpa Tensing Norisay and Mr Edmund Hillary, two members of Col. Hunt's 
British Expedition, had successfully climbed to the top of Mount Everest,

APPENDIX— of long Sanskrit Passages 

Page 118 Note 267. On pp. 117-118 above reference has 
been made to the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those that 
had been converted to Christianity or Islam by force or fraud or 
even voluntarily. Wot only was there re-admission of those that 
were oonverted, but non-Hindus, such as Yavanas, Kiratas, 
Safcas, were absorbed into the Hindu fold and were induced 
to adopt the practices of Hindus (such as sraddhas and gifts to 
brShmanas) Vide Santiparva chap. 65. 13-21 quoted above in 
note 830 (p. 364). A Greek ambassador of king Antalikita 
(Antialkidas) named Heliodora, son of Diya (Dion), was accre- 
dited to the court of king Bhagabhadra, called himself Bhaga- 
vata and raised a column in honour of Vasudeva in the 2nd 
century B. C. (JBAS 1909, pp. 1053 and 1087 and JBBBAS 
vol. 33 p 104). Usavadata, son of Dlnlka and son-in-law of 
Ksatrapa Nahapana, is described in one of the Nasik inscrip- 
tions (No. 14a in K I vol. Vm at p. 85) as a iaka, but made 
very extensive donations to brShmanas at Broach, Prabhasa 
and other places. Part of one of his inscriptions is cited on 
p 710 note 1618 above. Though the name Usavadata (Bsabha-

The text of the sirsn'g^ra here printed is based on three mss. from 
the Deccan College collection ( now at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, 
Poona), viz. No. 216 of 1879-80 copied in samvat 1539 ( 1482 A D. ), 
No. 196 of 1884-1887 copied in samvat 1578 (1521 A D.) and No 85 of 
1895-1902 copied in samvat 1780. All these mss. contain the bhjtya of 
Hanhara, which ascribes the work to f^sTt^"^ In the first ms the 
commentary on the first three verses is wanting. I intended at Brst to give 
explanations in Sanskrit of these verses (as p 308 will indicate) but 
owing to considerations of space I omitted the Sanskrit explanations.
