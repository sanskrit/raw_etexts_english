## XCI

*To Sister Christine*

HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM  
READING, LONDON.

*26th April '96*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

How are things going on with you? I am all safe and sound here in
England. Going to begin work from May fourth. How is Mrs. Funkey
\[Funke\]?

Give them all my Love. Write me all about yourself and Mrs. Funkey when
you have time. Address me at 63 St., George's Road, S.W. London.

Where is Krip. \[Swami Kripananda\]? What is he doing now? Has he been
able to get up any classes yet? Has his temper gone down?

Give them all my love — and \[to\] Miss Hamilton and to all my friends
and to the Rabbi \[Grossman of Detroit\].

Yours ever with love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA
