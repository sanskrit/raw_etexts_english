title = "Southwest monsoons in kAvya"

+++
The life line of bhArata, the southwest monsoon wind, appears to have
been an object of attention of the Hindu poets over the ages.

One example presented by vidyAkara, whose author remains unknown to me,
goes thus:  
vAti vyasta-lava\~Nga-lodhra-lavalI-ku\~njaH kara\~nja-drumAn Adhunvann
upabhukta mukta muralA toyormi-mAlA-jaDaH |  
svairaM dakShiNa-sindhu-kUla-kadalI-kachChopakaNThodbhavaH
kAverI-taTa-tADi-tADana-taTatkArottaro mArutaH ||

While the smooth and delicate alliterative effects of this verse are not
easily rendered from the devabhASha, one may roughly see it thus:  
The southwest monsoon wind blowing from the waves of the ocean of the
muralA land (northern Kerala) which,  it has tasted and abandoned,
 shakes up the trees of clove, Symplocos racemosa, star fruit and
Millettia pinnata beans. The wind born in the southern sea slopes with
banana groves blows at will rustling and beating the palms on the banks
of the kAverI.

Several poets resort to evoking shR^i\~NgAra as the primary rasa as they
describe the southwest monsoon winds. One example is a poem of unknown
authorship recorded by vidyAkara:  
bhuktvA chiraM dakShiNa-dig-vadhUm imAM vihAya tasyA bhayataH shanaiH
shanaiH |  
sa-gandha-sArAdi-kR^itA\~Nga-bhUShaNaH prayAty udIchIM dayitAm ivAnilaH
||

Here the southwest monsoon wind is described as having the southern
direction as a wife whom he has enjoyed for long. He then silently
steals away from her with his body laden with the perfumes of the south
to the northern direction which is like his lover (dayitA).

Yet other poets work the classification of women of the subcontinent
typical of the kAmashAstra into this expression of the shR^i\~NgAra
rasa. Two of the most famous of these are of the bauddha vasukalpa and
the shaiva shrIkaNTha-shiva.  
vasukalpa’s verse:  
andhrI-nIrandhra-pIna-stana-taTa-luThanAyAsamanda-prachArAsh
chArUn-nullAsayanto draviDa-vara-vadhU-hAri-dhammilla-bhArAn |  
jighrantaH siMhalInAM mukha-kamala-malaM keralInAM kapolaM chuMbanto
vAnti mandaM malaya-parimalA vAyavo dAkShiNAtyAH ||

It states that the fragrance bearing winds blowing from the south roll
and slow down after striking the surfaces of the firm and closely set
breasts of the andhra girls, then they delight among heavy flower-decked
hairdo of the wives of the Tamil country, then they smell the fresheners
in the lotus mouths of the girls of shrI lankA and finally kiss the
cheeks of the girls of kerala.

shrIkaNTha’s verse:  
kAntA-karShaNa-lola-kerala-vadhU-dhammilla-mallI-rajash chaurAsh
choDa-nitambinI-stana-taTe niShpandatAm AgatAH |  
revA-shIkara-dhAriNo .andhra-murala-strI-mAna-mudrAbhidaH vAtA vAnti
navIna-kokila-vadhU-hU\~NkAra-vAchAlitAH ||

Here the southwest monsoon winds are described as stealing the jamine
pollen from the hairdo of the kerala wifes which have been loosened by
the pulling by their paramours. Then the winds grow motionless upon
colliding with the breasts of the women of the Tamil country endowed
with good hips. Then they are said to bear the streams of water from the
revA peak and remove the self-consciousness of the women of the andhra
and murala countries, shrieking like a young female cuckoo.

All these are good examples of tropes working shR^i\~NgAra into the
description seasonal and weather patterns, a common theme in Hindu
poetry though they could offend the western-conditioned modern Indian
mind.
