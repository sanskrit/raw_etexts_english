## THE HYMN OF CREATION

(A translation of the *Nâsadiya-Sukta*, Rig-Veda, X. 129.)

Existence was not then, nor non-existence,  
The world was not, the sky beyond was neither.  
What covered the mist? Of whom was that?  
What was in the depths of darkness thick?

Death was not then, nor immortality,  
The night was neither separate from day,  
But motionless did *That* vibrate  
Alone, with Its own glory one —  
Beyond *That* nothing did exist.

At first in darkness hidden darkness lay,  
Undistinguished as one mass of water,  
Then *That* which lay in void thus covered  
A glory did put forth by *Tapah*!

First desire rose, the primal seed of mind,  
(The sages have seen all this in their hearts  
Sifting existence from non-existence.)  
Its rays above, below and sideways spread.

Creative then became the glory,  
With self-sustaining principle below.  
And Creative Energy above.

Who knew the way? Who there declared  
Whence this arose? Projection whence?  
For after this projection came the gods.  
Who therefore knew indeed, came out this whence?

This projection whence arose,  
Whether held or whether not,  
He the ruler in the supreme sky, of this  
He, O Sharman! knows, or knows not  
                                            He perchance!
