<p class="Page-Break">॥ Shri Hari॥</p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Shabari</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the time of Treta age, Varnashram Dharma is well recognized, in the forest, at many places, the hermitages of the sages are established. With the smoke of the Yagyas, performed by the ascetics, all the directions of pious land of Tapa are covered and the sky is explicating with the Veds chantings. In those days, in Dandakaranya forest, there lived a woman of Bhil Tribe, endowed with devotion and love to God, bereft of husband and son; whose name was Shabari.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, Shabari visited Matang Rishi for Darshan. She got great pleasure by the sight of the saint and she thought that if she could serve such great saints, my redemption is not a difficult matter. But at the same time the idea came to her mind that she was a low-born, how would he accept the service of such a mean woman? At last, she resolved that if my direct service was not accepted, let it be so, I will serve in a hidden way. She got a small cottage set up at a distance from the hermitages of the saints and nursing her livlihood on the roots and fruits of the forest, she began to serve secretly. She used to sweep the path early in the morning, on which the saints passed on to take their bath, removing pebbles or thorns completely on the way. In addition to it, she piled up dry woods near the hermitages before the dawn. Shabari was confident that kind saints would certainly pity her for this service. Seeing the grifty and thorny path smooth without any pebble or thorn, the sages were very much surprised and ordered their pupils to find out who was there to sweep the pathway and stacking the dry woods. The obedient pupils kept watch in the night and, in the wee hours of the night Shabari was caught with the bundle of woods placing there. Shabari got afraid very much. The pupils presented her before the sage Matang and said—‘Maharaj! We have caught the culprit who swept the path and placed the dry woods daily.’ Hearing the version of his pupils, the sage asked the frightened Shabari—‘Who are you? Why do you sweep the pathway and pile up the dry woods daily?’ Trembling with fear the devotee Shabari said very humbly having saluted—‘O Lord! <span class="char-style-override-6">m</span>y name is Shabari, unfortunately, I am born in a low family; I live in this very forest and sanctify myself with the vision of the austere sages like you. Considering myself unworthy for other services, I am given to such type of services. Lord! I am not worthy of your service. Kindly, pardon me for my fault.’ The kind-hearted sage Matang, hearing heart-touching and true words of Shabari, ordered to his disciples—‘She is very fortunate, let her live in a hut outside of the hermitage and arrange food material for her properly.’ Hearing the kind words of the sage, Shabari saluted with folded hands and said—‘O the merciful! I am living on the roots and fruits of the forest. Your food materials I want as this will be a blessing on me and I will be fulfilled. Neither I am fond of opulence nor this unsubstantial world is dear to me. ‘O the friend of the poor! <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>indly, give me such a blessing as it may result in salvation.’ Hearing the most humble and devotional words of Shabari, having pondered over for a little while, the sage, Matang said to her very affectionately—‘O the auspicious! <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>tay here fearlessly, and go on muttering the name of the Lord.’ By the mercy of the sage, wearing bark robes and matted hair, Shabari began to live in the hermitage concentrating her mind to the worship of the Lord. Other sages disliked it. They conveyed to sage Matang that he had provided room to the mean and low caste Shabari in the hermitage, to share meal with you is a far-fetched affair, even we would not like to talk to you. Matang, the Knower of essential nature of devotion, did not care for these words at all. He knew this fact that all of them were in illusion. They have no knowledge of Shabari’s identity, she is not only a lady of low caste rather, she is a God- devotee, a higher spirit. How one can be a wise one if he does not give due regard to a lowly born God-devotee? How could the sage, Matang disdain that Shabari, in whose heart Ram took delight? He did not think of his disrespect and he continued to develop Shabari’s devotion by his sermons.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, a long time passed engaged in the practice of adoration of God. The sage, Matang willed to give up his body, the pupils felt very much distressed to hear this. Shabari began to wail in distress and lamentation. The preceptor’s departure to the heaven became unbearable to her. She said—‘Lord! Don’t proceed alone, this maidservant is also ready to accompany you.’ Seeing the downcast, the destitute with folded hands, Shabari in front, the sage Matang said—‘O virtuous lady! Forget this lamentation; Lord Shri Ramchandra is in Chitrakoot at present. He is sure to visit here. You will be able to have His vision with your own eyes apparently. He is the manifestation of Narayan Himself. His very sight would lead to your salvation. Affectionate to devotees, the Lord, when visits your hut, by giving him warm reception in all respects, you should make your life fulfilled. Till then, stay here, muttering the name of Shri Ram.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having given assurance to Shabari in this way, the sage left for his divine abode. On the other hand, Shabari absorbed herself so deeply in the meditation of the Lord, that she had no mind for any other thing. Living her life, on roots and fruits, Shabari began to wait for the auspicious visit of Lord Shri Ram. As the time passes, the craving for sight of Lord Shri Ram waxed on. Just inferring from any sort of sound, she used to come out running and with intense curiosity, she asks each and every tree, creepers, leaves, flowers and fruits, birds and animals—‘Now, how far is Shri Ram yet, when will He reach here?’ In the morning she says that the Lord will reach here by evening. In the evening she again says that at any cost He will visit here tomorrow in the morning. Sometimes she goes out of the hut and sometimes, she comes in. Again and again she sweeps the path and removes the pebbles and thorns, worrying lest Ram’s feet should be hurt. She always gets her hut ready by plastering the ground with cow-dung and cow-urine. She makes squared raised platform of the mud and dung daily new one. Sometimes she startles to stand up and goes out and thinks that the Lord would have come outside. She keeps safe the fruits of the forest which seem to be the most tasty and sweet, with great fondness for her Lord Ram. In the hastiness of the Lord’s auspicious view she became as if mad. The sound of the dry leaves falling on the earth, creates suspicion in her of the approaching sound of the footsteps of her beloved Ram and she runs away towards it. Thus, all the twenty four hours her mind remain anchored in the Lord Ram, but Ram did not come. Once, the sage children said—‘Shabari! Your Ram is coming.’ It was more than enough. Having placed the jujube tree fruits and other fruits in her courtyard, she rushed up to fetch water from the pond. In the intoxication of love she was unconscious of her own body. One of the sages was coming back after taking his holy bath. Shabari got him touched unknowingly. The sage got enraged, He said—‘What a wicked lady! She insults us knowingly.’ Being engrossed in her thoughts she heard nothing and went away to the pond. The sage also went to take a bath again. As soon as, he entered the water to take bath, the water of the pond got infected with the worms and its colour turned to red like blood. Even then, he could not realise that it was the effect of the God-devotee—Shabari’s insult. On the otherside, Shabari had not <br/>yet reached with the holy water, when the Lord Shri Ram was seen from quite a distance asking—‘Where is My Shabari?’ Although, all the sages were confident that the Lord would visit them certainly; so also it was their presumption that He would visit them first. But when compassionate to the poors, Lord Shri Ramchandra began to enquire of the Shabari’s hut instead of visiting them, the arrogant sages, proud of their austerity, got amazed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Experiencing such a great grace of the Lord Shri Ram to herself with the great rapturous enthusiasm, being very emotional, Shabari moved ahead before them to receive and welcome the Lord Ram.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In ‘Bhaktmal’ it is described as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आगू चले राम, आई आगू लेन सबरीहू,</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">चरण परन धाई वे मिलनेको धाये हैं।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गिरी दण्डहीसी, भुजदण्डसों उठाय लीन्हीं,</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">फिरिकै गिरी सो, पुनि भुज पसराये हैं॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रेम-दशा कही नहीं जात, ‘रघुराज’ दोऊ,</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तन मन बचनकी सुधि बिसराये हैं।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भले आप मिले मोहिं भली मिली तो हूँ यह,</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कहत दुहुनके भकारे भरि आये हैं॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तनुको सँभारि करि ताको मिली बार-बार</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बारिज-बिलोचननि प्रेमबारि ढारिकै।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">करको पकरि तासु ताहिकी कुटीको चले,</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">‘रघुराज’ राम मुनिमण्डल बिसारिकै॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पुनि पुनि पूछै प्रभु तेरी कुटि केती दूरि</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जामें हौं बसौंगो औध-आनँदलौ बारिकै।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कौशलाते मिथिलाते कमला-निवासहूँते</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पायो मैं सनेह-सुख तोहींको निहारिकै॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Ram moved ahead. Shabari came forward to receive him. Running ahead, Shabari fell flat on the Lord Ram’s feet. The Lord lifted her with His arms. He had stretched His arms to lift her when again she fell down. The affectionate condition of the both, Ram and Shabari is difficult to be described in words. They have forgotten their body, mind and speech and their own existence at all in their excess of love and affection. The both express their gratitude to each other on this meeting and while expressing, their throat is choked and they began to shed tears of love and joy. Then, holding her hands, the Lord moves towards her hut, ignoring the sages and their hermitages. Again and again He asks her the distance of her hut where they would stay in pleasure and delight. He says that He gets more delight and comfort in her hut than He gets in <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>ausal or Mithila or even in Goddess <span class="char-style-override-6">k</span>amala’s abode. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, stating so Lord Shri Ram with Lakshman reached Shabari’s hermitage.*</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-7">* Though, Shabari was low born, she had already acquired some celebrity for her pity and devotion, hence the poet has choosen to all her abode a hermitage. This can easily serve an illustration of the catholicity of the great Hindu religion, which though rigid in social matters, does not fail to give proper recognition to individual merit and value.</span></p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सबरी देखि राम गृहँ आए।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मुनि के बचन समुझि जियँ भाए॥</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सबरी परी चरन लपटाई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रेम मगन मुख बचन न आवा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पुनि पुनि पद सरोज सिर नावा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Shriramcharitmanas 3/33/3—5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Shabari saw that Shri Ram had called at her hermitage, she recalled the words of (her Guru) sage Matanga and was glad at heart. With lotus-like eyes, long arms, tuft of matted hair adorning their head like a crown and garlands of wild flowers adorning their breast, the two brothers looked most charming—the one dark of hue and the other fair; Shabari fell prostrate and embraced their feet. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Today, Shabari’s joy has no bound. Being mad in love she began to dance. By clapping with her hands, she got so much absorbed in dancing that she had no care of her covering upper garment even, was completely oblivious of her body. Just seeing Shabari sunk in the ocean of joy, Lord was very glad and smiling he glanced towards Lakshman. Then, laughing Lakshman said with sobriety—‘Shabari! <span class="char-style-override-6">w</span>ill you go on dancing only? Just see! <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>ince how long Sri Ram has been standing, will you not offer Him seat and welcome Him?’ These words brought her in consciousness as then—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तौ दृष्ट्वा तु सदा सिद्धा समुत्थाय कृताञ्जलि:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पादौ जग्राह रामस्य लक्ष्मणस्य च धीमत:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पाद्यमाचमनीयं च सर्वं प्रादाद् यथाविधि।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तामुवाच ततो राम: श्रमणीं धर्मसंस्थिताम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Val. Ramayan, 3/74/6-7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rising respectfully with joined palms on seeing the two princes, Shabari (who had attained perfection through Yoga or abstraction) for her part presently clasped the feet of Shri Ram and the prudent Lakshman and offered to her honoured guests with due ceremony water to bathe their feet and rinse their mouth with and every other form of hospitality. Shri Ram then spoke as follows to the aforesaid ascetic woman, who was intent upon virtue:</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सादर जल लै चरन पखारे।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पुनि सुंदर आसन बैठारे॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Shriramcharitmanas 3/33/10)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘She brought water and reverently washed their feet and then seated them with honour.’ Lord Shri Ram began to ask that devoted Shabari—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कच्चित्ते निर्जिता विघ्ना: कच्चित्ते वर्धते तप:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कच्चित्ते नियत: कोप आहारश्च तपोधने॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कच्चित्ते नियमा: प्राप्ता: कच्चित्ते मनस: सुखम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कच्चित्ते गुरुशुश्रूषा सफला चारुभाषिणि॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Val. Ramayan, 3/74/8-9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘“Have all impediments to the practice of your austerities been thoroughly overcome by you? Is your asceticism steadily growing? Has anger been fully controlled by you as well as your diet, O lady ! with asceticism alone as your wealth? Are all your religious vows fully observed and has satisfaction come to your mind? Has your attendance on your preceptor borne fruit, O lady of pleasing speech?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of the Lord Shri Ram, the old  ascetic woman recognised as respectable among the accomplished male ascetics, said—‘Lord! Kindly don’t put me to shame by addressing me ‘perfect, proficient, ascetics etc. Today, I have got my life successful only by your vision.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अद्य प्राप्ता तप:सिद्धिस्तव संदर्शनान्मया।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अद्य मे सफलं जन्म गुरवश्च सुपूजिता:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अद्य मे सफलं तप्तं स्वर्गश्चैव भविष्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">त्वयि देववरे राम पूजिते पुरुषर्षभ॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Val. Ramayan, 3/74/11-12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Lord! Today has the fruition of my austerities been attained by me through your blessed sight. Today my birth as a human being has borne fruit and my elders have been duly adored. My asceticism too has become fruitful today and the highest heaven too will definitely fall to my lot, now that you, the foremost of gods, have been worshipped by me, O Ram, the flower of humanity.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shabari could speak no more. Her throat choked in the overwhelming love. Keeping quiet for a while, she again uttered—‘Lord! The collected rootlets and fruits in your honour are still lying to serve you. Lord! Kindly, fulfil my desires to accept those fruits of the helpless like me.’ Saying, thus, Shabari began to offer the fruits collected since long, to the Lord and the Lord—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to his promise of the Gita, He began to partake of these fruits offered with love, praising again and again. </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तदहं भक्त्युपहृतमश्नामि प्रयतात्मन:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(9/26)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whosoever offers with love a Leaf, a flower, a fruit or even water, I appear in person before that disinterested devotee of sinless mind and delightfully partake of that article offered by him/her with love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In Padma Puran, Lord Vyasji has said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">फलानि च सुपक्वानि मूलानि मधुराणि च।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्वयमास्वाद्य माधुर्यं परीक्ष्य परिभक्ष्य च॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पश्चान्निवेदयामास राघवाभ्यां दृढव्रता।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">फलान्यास्वाद्य काकुत्स्थस्तस्यै मुक्तिं परां ददौ॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shabari began to serve these ripe wild roots and fruits after testing herself, to the Lord.* She gave to the Lord only those fruits which she found the sweetest. Having relished the fruits the Lord also granted her the <span class="char-style-override-6">s</span>upreme abode.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English para-style-override-4">* From the lines of Valmiki Ramayan it seems that Shabari did not belong to a low caste, only her name was Shabari. Bhils are called Shabar also. On this basis possibly, the people began to call her Bhilani. Shabari was an austere. She had acquired a high status in austerity. That is why the Lord has addressed her with so many titles like ‘Shramani, Dharmsansthita, Siddha, Siddha Sammata, Tapasi etc. Apart from this, it is also not possible that she had offered the Lord then tasted fruits. The description of Padmpuran must have the sense that ‘when she brought the fruits, she used to test other fruit of that tree. She would have stored the fruits of only better trees.’ This sense seems to be more appropriate. </p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">Really, love is not guided by any rule, but the Lord Shri Ram’s life is based on the moral dignity, so it is proper to take its sense in this way, but those who explain it as out of love, are also quite appreciable.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कंद मूल फल सुरस अति दिए राम कहुँ आनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रेम सहित प्रभु खाए बारंबार बखानि॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, by the great grace of devotee-affectionate Lord Shri Ram, being well satisfied with the accomplishment of her inner desires, Shabari got immese joy. Then, with folded hands she said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पानि जोरि आगें भइ ठाढ़ी।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Shriramcharitmanas 3/34/1-2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Folding her hands she stood before Him; as she gazed upon the Lord, her devotion grew yet more and more ardent. ‘How can I extol You, lowest, in descent and the dullest of wit as I am? A woman is the lowest of those who rank as the lowest of the low. Of them again I am the most dull-headed, O Destroyer of sins.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘O good lady! Now, I tell you the nine forms of Devotion; please, listen attentively and cherish them in your mind. The first in order is association of the saints, the second is marked by a fondness for the episodes of my sports. Humble service of the lotus feet of one’s preceptor is the third form of Devotion, while the fourth form of Devotion consists in singing My glory with guileless heart. Muttering My name with unwavering faith constitutes the fifth form of adoration revealed in the Veds. The sixth variety consists in the practice of self-control and virtue, desisting from manifold activities and ever persuing the course of conduct prescribed for saints. He who practises the seventh type, sees the world full of Me without distinction and reckons the saints as even greater than Myself. He who cultivates the eighth type of Devotion remains contented with whatever he gets and never thinks of detecting others faults even in dream. The ninth form of Devotion demands that one should be guileless and straight in one’s dealings with everybody and should, in the heart, cherish implicit faith in Me without either exultation or depression. Whoever possesses any one of these nine forms of Devotion, be a man or woman or any other creature—sentient or insentient, is most dear to Me, O good lady. As for yourself, you are blessed with unflinching devotion of all these types. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, after sketching the forms of Devotion the Lord provides Shabari His Supreme Abode.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘The state which is hardly won by the Yogis, is within your easy reach today.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same time, most of the saints and Munis in Dandak Van reached there at the hermitage of Shabari. Maryadapurushottam, the Lord Shri Ram and Lakshman standing up welcomed the saints and asked their well being. All gave the same answer— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">त्वद्दर्शनाद् रघुश्रेष्ठ जाता: स्मो निर्भया वयम्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the best of Raghu’s! We have become fearless by Your vision.’ Lord! We are the big offenders. We humiliated the great saint like Matang due to this great devotee Shabari. The great devotee Shabari is highly blessed, who is so fortunate to get the visit of Narayan at her hut? We committed a great mistake. Thus, all the saints began to pray to the Lord expressing their repentence. It opened the eyes of sages who were proud of their knowledge residing in Dandakvan.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the Brahman ladies of Braj violated the orders of their husbands, reaching directly in the service of the Supreme Being Shri Krishna and thus, they had set the example of their great devotion, the Brahmans considered it very ill first, but in the last when they realised, they expressed their repentance and cursing to themselves— </p>

Undoubtedly the Lord’s divine potency spells even the Yogis of repute. Being the preceptors of people, we are called Brahmans, but we missed our own welfare (Devotion to the Lord).’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Well! Realising the repenting sentiments of the saints and sages, Shri Lakshmanji said to them— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अहो धन्यतमा यूयं तपोव्रतपरायणा:।</p>

You have made your abodes in the forest with the attitude of detachment, having given up all the worldly sensuous pleasures. This world of animate and inanimate beings is holding on to righteousness by your influence only.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sages felt a little consolation by such words, in the meantime one of the sages said—‘O affectionate to the shelter seekers! Why is the water of this holy and charming pond being infected with the worms and why has it turned to red like blood?’ Smiling Lakshmanji said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मतङ्गमुनिविद्वेषाद् रामभक्तावमानत:।</p>

The only way to bring it back to the original shape is that Shabari should touch it once again.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the permission of the Lord, Shabari entered the pond and the water turned limpid as before. This is the glory of the devotees. Being pleased, the Lord again asked Shabari to ask for any boon. Shabari said— </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Of Lowest, indescent and dullest of wit as I am, even then, I am having Your vision in person, it is the fruit of Your common grace; yet this is my longing that my unwavering devotion to You may remain forever!’ The Lord, smiling said—‘Be it so!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shabari willed and sought permission of the Lord to abandon her earthily body, the Lord granted her wish. Just before the saints, Shabari departed for the supreme Divine abode having left the physical body here, and applausive sounds began to resound in all the directions. </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘By displaying Gopi-like love for Lord Krishna, Mirabai set an example in the Kaliyug. She sang the glory of her beloved in an unrestrained and fearless way; The wicked, considering these singings as immoral, made attempts to kill her. She drank the poison offered to her, like nectar even then she remained unscathed. Miraji cutting asunder the fetters of family and public slander, worshipped Lord Girdhar by the beat of drum feeling ashamed of none. The wickeds, considering it as immoral, made attempts to kill her. She remained unscathed, and drank the poison like nectar. She proclaimed her devotion by beat of drum without any shame. Thus, She sang the glory of her beloved in an unrestrained and fearless way.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Who does not know the name of Mirabai? That gem among the devotees, the Rajput lovely woman, whose matchless fables of devotion are sung even today by millions of people to attain the Devotion to God and they attain it doing so, numberless men and women are swayed away in the holy current of the sentiment of love for God by singing the holy stanzas full of love, by following the excellent moral character of that goddess, memorable in the morning the devotees loving the Lords Devotion are gratified to get the sight of blue-cloud-lotus face of Shyamsunder, because the Lord is not pleased so much by the sing in the praise of His own merits as much He is pleased by the sing praising the glory, virtues and merits of His devotees. Therefore, this mean writer also wants to be fulfilled in his life by singing a bit glory of living embodiment of divine love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To glorify the Indian womenfolk, dedicated to Devotion, Mirabai was born in a village Kuraki in Marwad about the Samvat 1558. Her father’s name was Rathaur Shri Ratan Singhji. Mira was the only daughter of her parents. She had been brought up with great fondling and endearment. Her mental propensites and sentiments were bent towards the God since her childhood. One day, a Sadhu visited her house. He had a very lovely idol of the Lord. Requesting him, Mira took that idol. Handing over the idol to Mira, the Sadhu said to her—‘This is God, His name is Girdharlalji. Worship Him daily with love and devotion.’ The simple and soft-hearted girl Mira, began to worship the God devotedly. Mira was ten years old than, but throughout the day, she used to remain engaged in bathing, offering sandal paste and flowers, food and performing Arati to that idol she had memorized the stanza of Surdasji which she always used to sing before the Lord again and again.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जो विधना निज वश करि पाऊँ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तो सब कहो होय सखि मेरो, अपनी साध पुराऊँ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">लोचन रोम-रोम प्रति माँगौं, पुनि पुनि त्रास दिखाऊँ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">इकटक रहै पलक नहिं लागे, पद्धति नई चलाऊँ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कहा करौं छबि-राशि श्यामघन, लोचन द्वै न अघाऊँ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ये ते पर ये निमिष ‘सूर’ सुनु यह दुख काहि सुनाऊँ॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘If I could have the control over the Lord of destiny, I would fulfil all my longings making Him my own. I would ask Him to remain before my eye sight so that I might stare at Him without a wink by frightening Him again and again and thus, I would start a new system. What should I do, my both of the eyes remain always thirsty of seeing that dark cloudy heap of beauty. Surdas says that whom should she express this agony of her heart? While singing this stanza many times, Mira used to be unconscious perhaps she might be visioning Shyamsunder—a mass of beauty.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By this time, Mira, herself, began to compose the stanzas. When she sang the self-composed stanzas before the Lord in melodious voice, the stream of love as if flowed. Love in hearts of the audience, men and women surged up. In this way, five years passed in the profound flow of powerful divine loveful feelings. In the Samvat 1573, Mira’s wedding with Bhojraj, the eldest son of Maharana Sangaji in the Sisodia dynasty of Chittaur, was ceremonised. On the occasion of marriage ceremony, a wonderful incidence occured. The embodiment of Krishna-love, Mira got seated her Girdharlalji in the canopy even before the ceremony and while going round the sacred fire with the prince Bhojraj, she took round with Girdharlalji also. Mira thought that she was married with the Lord also that day.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira’s mother was acquainted with this happening. She said to Mira—‘Daughter! What this role have you played?’ Smiling Mira said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">माई म्हाँने सुपनेमें बरी गोपाल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राती पीती चुनड़ी ओढ़ी मेहँदी हाथ रसाल॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">काँई औरको बरूँ भाँवरी म्हाँके जगजंजाल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीराके प्रभु गिरधर नागर करो सगाई हाल॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O mother! Gopal married me in dream. In the night I wore the wedding saree and decorated my hands with myrtle paste. My consciousness instructed me not to choose anyone else who remains always entangled in the worldly affairs and who is mortal. Mira’s Lord is Girdhar Nagar and make haste to marry with Him, who is eternal.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mother was highly delighted to see this Mira’s strange Devotional sentiment to the Lord. When all her female friends came to know this, they asked her the reason of going round the sacred fire with <span class="char-style-override-6">g</span>irdharlalji, making joke. Mira said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ऐसे बरको के बरूँ जो जन्मैं और मर जाय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बर बरिये गोपालजी म्हारौ चुड़लो अमर हो जाय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Why to choose such a husband who is born and dies, why not to choose Gopalji who is immortal and thus, my happy state of wifehood will also be immortal.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Parents gifted a lot of wealth in dowry to their dearest heart, Mira; but they saw Mira’s face gloomy; then, the mother asked—‘Daughter! What do you want? Take away whatever you want.’ Mira said to her mother—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दे री माई अब म्हाँको गिरधरलाल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्यारे चरणकी आन करतिहौं, और न दे मणि लाल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नातो सागो परिवारो सारो, मन लगे मानो काल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीराके प्रभु गिरधर नागर, छबि लखि भई निहाल॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O my mother! If you want to give me something, give my deity, Girdharlal. Don’t give me gems and jewels, I pray to your feet to provide me the service of His feet. All the kith and kin, all the relatives and family members are as if Kal (Yama) to me. Girdhar Nagar is the only Lord of Mira. I feel fulfilled to see His beauty.’ What is more needed to a devotee except one’s deity? The mother got the throne of Girdharlalji placed in the palanquin of Mira very gladly. The prince Bhojraj came to the capital with the newly wedded bride. In every home the auspicious congratulatory words began to be exchanged. The mother-in-law felt overjoyed to see her beautiful and meritorious daughter-in-law. According to the family customs, the preparation for the worship of family deity was made, but Mira said—‘I will adore only Girdharlalji and none else.’ The mother-in-law got extremely annoyed, she uttered a few harsh and sweet sentences also to Mira, but Mira remained firm to her vow. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Among the Rajputs, the worship of Gauri is in custom every year. The small girls and the married women perform the ‘Gauri-worship’ with keen eagerness for being blessed with handsome and virtuous bridegrooms and immortality of husband. Mira was also asked for the ‘Gauri-worship’. Mira refused point blank. The entire gynaecium got annoyed of Mira. The mother-in-law and husband’s sister Udabai tried their best to persuade Mira; but she was not convinced. She said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ना म्हें पूजा गौरज्याजी ना पूजा अनदेव।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">म्हें पूजा रणछोरजी सासु थे काँई जाणो भेव॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I will worship neither Gauri nor any other god or goddess, O my mother-in-law! How will you  know this mistery? I would worship only ‘Ranchhodji (Shri Krishna).’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mother-in-law became very angry. The fellow-female friends also said to Mira—‘Sister! This is the worship for the life of your husband; everyone ought to do it.’ Mira answered—‘Sisters! My husband is immortal one, who is suspicious of the immortality of her husband, should worship other one in place of Girdharlalji.’ Those, who understood the profoundity of these words were blessed; but most of the women took it otherwise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing this devotion of Mira towards the Lord, first, Bhojraj became a bit angry; but in the end he was very much pleased and impressed with the pure devotion of simple-hearted Mira towards Lord. He got a separate temple of Shri Ranchhodji built for Mira. The prince Bhojraj was a courageous and brave young man of literary taste. He was feeling a great pleasure and dignified by the stanzas composed by Mira. Whenever he saw Mira’s moon-like face titillated with love, his mind got attracted to Mira. When Mira, having composed new stanzas sang before her husband in person, the prince used to be overjoyed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Although Mira considered only Girdharlalji as her real husband and spent her most of the time in His service; but she never allowed any opportunity to worldly husband Bhojrajji to let him be annoyed. By her simple and good nature she kept always happy through her selfless spirit of service. It is said that after some time by the permission of Mira, the prince had organised the second marriage. This wedding made Mira very happy. She was always in contraction that she could not fulfil her husband’s desire. Now, seeing her husband satisfied with the second queen and considering the possibility of her full time engagement in the service of her real husband—the Supreme Lord, Mira felt overly delighted. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira began to spend her whole time in the muttering and reverential sing and in the association of saints. Some times, she wept due to pangs of separation, sometimes she used to laugh having His vision in meditation, sometimes she danced in love; she had forgotten the hunger-thirst. Continuous for a number of days, she remained lying in meditation of love without eating and drinking. If anybody happened to come to persuade her, she talked only about the love of Krishna. No other matter appealed her liking. Her body became feeble, the family members thought that she was ill, the physicians were consulted, even her father came with a physician from Marwad. Mira said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हे री मैं तो राम दिवानी, मेरो दरद न जाणे कोय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सूली ऊपर सेज हमारी, किस बिध सोणा होय॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गगन मँडलपै सेज पियाकी, किस बिध मिलणा होय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">घायलकी गति घायल जाने, कि जिन लाई होय॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जौहर की गति जौहरि जाने, कि जिन जौहर होय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दरदकी मारी बन बन डोलूँ बैद मिल्या नहिं कोय॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीराकी प्रभु पीर मिटै जब बैद साँवलिया होय।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O friend! I am mad of Lord Ram, none knows my anguish. My bedding lies on the point of pike, how can I sleep? My husband’s bed lies in the canopy of space, how to meet? Only the wounded can realise the pain of wounded one or else he who has dealt the blow. It is only the jeweller who knows the reality of gems and jewels or who owns the jewel. Being afflicted with pain, I roam about the forests, but no physician could be available. Mira will get rid of the pain when Shyamsundar Himself, is the physician.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The physicians treated. But how was it possible for these poor physician to treat the patient mad in divine love. Afflicted with the pain of separation from Shyam, Mira sang the following stanza— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नातो नावको जी म्हाँसू तनक न तोडॺो जाय। टेक।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पाना ज्यूँ पीली पड़ी रे, लोग कहें पिंडरोग।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">My relationship has been established with the Name of the Lord which is impossible for me to break off. My body has become pale on account of His separation and the people take it as the disease of body. To meet the Lord Ram, I observed fasts secretly, the fools and insane called in the physicians and holding my hands they showed my nerves, the ignorant physician doesn’t know the real cause. Really, there is the pang of separation in my heart. All the physicians should go back to their homes. Don’t try to treat me. As a matter of fact, I am suffering from the disease of separation. Why do you give me the medicine? I have been reduced to skeleton. My flesh has waned. Bangle reached the throat. My finger ring slips to the upper part of the hand. The papaiya croaks intermittently, but never takes the name of its beloved. If the separated one overhears it, she shall give up her life. I have become restless in His separation. For a moment I go to the temple and the next moment, I  come in the courtyard and for the moment, I remain stood standstill. In this way, I am wandering in the <br/>pain of wound but none feels and knows my pain. Having taken out my heart, I put it outside for the crow to carry it to the place, where my Lord resides and it should eat it before Him. At present, I like nothing but only His name. So O my Lord! Grace this afflicted Mira with Your vision.’ What a craving! What a zeal! How pleasant is the longing!! This is what compels God to come under her spell; This is what compels Him to be sold. This is the price what Mira paid to purchase Him. Mira has said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गोबिन्द लीन्यो मोल, माई मैं गोबिन्द लीन्यो मोल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कोई कहै सस्तो कोई कहै महँगो लीन्यो तराजू तोल॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Anyone whose conscience of mind like beetle gets engrossed into the taste of the flower-corn juice of Shyamsundar’s lotus feet, how can he or she be charmed by the other objects? One, who got the glimpse of that outstanding appearance even in the dream, in whose heart the seed of that pious love got germinated even a little, who tasted that sweet nectar of love even unknowingly, can never cast his/her look towards the enjoyments of this world. </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the Lord! Make Mira Your true maidservant. To Get me released from the bonds of the false worldly activities. I am being robbed of my wisdom despite the best use of my talented power. O Ram! I am helpless and in the condition of dying, so, O the Lord! Rush up and rush up. Daily I hear the moral sermons and I remain always frightened from evil thinking of mind, I always serve the Sadhus and remain absorbed in the meditation, remembering You. Lead Your maidservant Mira on the path of Devotion and make me Your true maidservant.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the marriage, ten years passed in the sway of Devotion. In the Samvat 1583 the prince Bhojraj passed away. Maharana Sangaji also died. The younger brother of Mira’s husband, Vikramajit was enthroned. Mira was not shocked at all by the pain of her husband’s death, on account of her devotion to the Lord. Her association with the saints and exalted souls went on increasing, Mira’s upsurge of Devotion went on waxing by leaps and bounds. Rana Vikramajit disliked Mira’s way of living, visits of the Sadhus—Vaishnavas in the palace freely without any check and the reverential sing all the twenty-four hours. He felt sore. He tried his best to persuade Mira. Champa and Chameli, two maidservants were engaged for this purpose; Rana’s sister, Udabai also remained persuading Mira, but Mira did not deviate the least from her routine. First, Mira told the persuading female friends her resolve very humbly but at last she said in clear words</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘O the female friends! listen, I won’t listen to anyone. Since, you are wise and close to me, so I express my mind and my inner feelings before you. I want to take the pleasure of Lord’s association in the company of saints and hermits thus, I want to keep myself away from the worldly people. I am ready to sacrifice my body and wealth, everything and I am ready to sacrifice my head even, I can tolerate the scolding of anyone, as my mind is anchored in God. Mira’s Lord is only Girdhar Nagar and I want to live in the shelter of true preceptor.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The female friends said—‘Miraji! You love the God, do love. There is no objection here at all but ignoring the family dignity, to live in the company of Sadhus day and night and dancing and singing is not advisable. The king Maharana is much displeased with it.’ Mira said— </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘If Sisodia is annoyed, what harm he can assail against me? I will sing the Lord’s merits. If Ranaji is enraged, he may turn me out of his state, but if my Lord Hari is enraged I have no place to go anywhere. Where will I go then? I don’t care for the public slander, I am fearless to wander in devotion of the Lord. By remembering the name of the Lord, I will cross the ocean of the world. Mira is in the shelter of cloudy coloured Girdhar and I am strongly clung to the lotus feet of Girdhar.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a firm determination is! What a firm faith in the Lord is! What a fearlessness is! What a wonderful sacrifice! Uda and the maidservants had come to persuade her, seeing the pure devotional love of Mira, their minds also were directed towards the same side. They were also coloured with the deep colour of devotional love. At last, Rana sent a cup of poison in the name of nectarial offering. Just hearing the name of nectar, Mira quaffed it with great love. The Lord showed His beneficence and the poison turned into nectar. She remained unscathed. What an affection for a devotee! What is impossible to the Lord’s grace? </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘By the Lord’s grace, even the poison turns into nectar, the foe becomes friend, ocean turns like the cow hoof and the fire cools.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being overwhelmed by love Mira sang—</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीरा प्रभु गिरधर भजिबेको, सन्तचरण लिपटानी॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I knew that Ranaji administered me poison. That Lord whose name remains on my tongue, distinguished the milk and water. Until the gold is not assayed—nothing can be said about its purity. Hiding my family, I am a helpless woman all alone. By mind and body I have sold myself to the Lord. Mira clings to the feet of saints to remember and mutter the Lord’s name.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">‘पग बाँध घुँघरु मीरा नाची रे’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Mira began to dance wearing the small round bells around the ankles.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The maidservants gave this news to Ranaji. He was wonder-struck. In the Kaliyug wherefrom did this new Prahlad appear?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira’s whole time began to pass in muttering and reverential sing. There was no trace of sleep and hunger, no care of the body. Throughout the day, she wept and used to sing.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">घड़ी एक नहिं आवड़ै, तुम दरशण बिन मोय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तुम हो मेरे प्राणजी, कैसे जीवण होय॥</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">घायल-सी घूमत फिरूँ रे, मेरा दरद न जाणे कोय॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दिवस तो खाय गमाइया रे, रैण गमाई सोय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्राण गमाया झूरताँ रे, नैण गमाया रोय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Not a single moment passes without your view. You are my soul, how this life is possible? Rice does not give any relish, the sleep has gone far away from me, the pain of separation always afflicts me. I remain wandering about like a wounded one, none knows my agony. I passed the day time in eating and passed the night in sleep. I lost my heart by craving and lost the eyes by weeping.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira used to dance before the Lord as if intoxicated, having closed the door of the temple in the night. It seemed as if the Lord having appeared, were talking to her. Various types of gossips started in the palace. The female friends said—‘Mira! You are a young pretty lady, whom do you wait for throughout the day? Who is he for whom do you sob? Being intoxicated by emotion, Mira said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दरस बिन दूखन लागे नैन।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जबसे तुम बिछुरे मेरे प्रभुजी, कबहुँ न पायो चैन॥</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बिरह बिथा कासूँ कहूँ सजनी, वह गई करवत नैन।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीराके प्रभु कब रे मिलोगे, दुख मेटन सुख दैन॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘My eyes aching for the glimpse of the Lord. Since  You left me, I have been remaining restless. My breast heaves at your name but it seems to be very soothing. I remain watching the path constantly without wink. The night has become as of six months for me. O the friend! Whom should I speak the pangs of separation? I feel as if the saw is being applied to my eyes. O the Lord! When will You be kind to meet Mira to allay her pain and bestow her pleasure?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The maidservant tried to coax her—‘‘O Sister! What you say is no doubt, right, but by doing so your family is being disgraced.” Mira said—‘What should I do? It is beyond my control.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आली री, मेरे नैनन बान पड़ी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">चित्त चढ़ी मेरे माधुरी मूरत, उर बिच आनु अड़ी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कबकी ठाढ़ी पंथ निहारूँ, अपने भवन खड़ी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीरा गिरधर हाथ बिकानी, लोक कहैं बिगड़ी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O my female friends! My eyes have got accustomed to watch his sweet face, that pleasing image has won my heart, it has hung up in the heart. I have been waiting watching His way standing since long at my house. Mira says that she has been sold in His hands and the world declares her as if corrupt.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a holy emotion is! But everyone has one’s own interpretation according to one’s own wit. This is the nature of the man to blame others according to his own evil thoughts. Some told tales to Ranaji, they convinced him that Mira’s character had been corrupted. Throughout the day, she weeps like a separated woman and in the midnight the sound of the voice of someone else is heard in her palace. Probably, certainly there is something wrong.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this, Rana got enraged fiercely. That very day, in the night, with the naked sword in his hand, he went into the palace of Mira. The doors were closed. The voice of some male person was heard to Rana also from the palace; it is doubtful to say whether it was the result of Ranas firm resolve or it was the frolicsome play of the Lord. However, Rana got the doors opened abruptly. What he finds, that Mira is sitting plunged in Love. There is none else. Bringing Mira to consciousness Rana asked—‘Tell me who was here with you?’ Mira promptly answered—‘Who could be here other one except that dandy Girdharlalji? If there is any other one in the universe should come in front.’ Rana had no capability to understand its secret. He searched out the whole palace very carefully, but no one could be traced out. Then, being ashamed he returned back. Mira sang the hymn— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राणाजी! मैं साँवरे रंग राची।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सज सिणगार पद बाँध घूँघरू, लोक लाज तजि नाची॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गयी कुमति लहि साधुकी संगति, भक्ति रूप भइ साँची।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गाय गाय हरि के गुण निसिदिन, काल-ब्याल तें बाँची॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">उन बिनु सब जग खारो लागत और बात सब काँची।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीराके प्रभु गिरधर नागर, भक्ति रसीली जाँची॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Ranaji! I have got myself moulded as Girdharilal. Being well decorated, wearing the trinkets around the ankles, not feeling abashed I danced. The evil ideas were washed away. I am cherishing the association of Sadhus; I have become devotion personified. Having sung the virtues of the Lord Hari, day and night, I escaped myself from the serpent of death. Without Him, the entire world seems to be bitter and all other matters seem to be false. I have already tasted the taste of Devotion, Mira says that Mira’s Lord, Girdhar Nagar is the only reality who is well tested?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">She sang an other stanza—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बसो मेरे नैननमें नँदलाल॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मोहनी मूरति साँवरि सूरति, नैणा बने बिसाल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अधर-सुधारस मुरली राजत, उर बैजन्ती-माल॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">छुद्र घंटिका कटि-तट सोभित, नूपुर सबद रसाल।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीरा प्रभु संतन सुखदाई, भगत बछल गोपाल॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Mira prays to the Lord to inhabit in her eyes. She is fond of seeing the charming appearance of the Lord in the colour of dark cloud shape, and His big eyes, the flute suiting His lips and the Vaijayanti wreath on His bosom, His waist adorned with small bells and its sound soothing to the ears very pleasant. Mira says that O Lord of Mira, you are the giver of joy to the saints. O Gopal! You are very affectionate towards Your devotees.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The nectarial words of Mira did have no impact on the sensuous gloomy mind of Rana overwhelmed by delusion. Rana returned back. Mira began to talk out about the Lord fearlessly as usual having no care of the public slander and family dignity. One day, a hyporcrite Sadhu came to Mira and said—‘Girdharlalji has sent me to you and he has ordered me to make sex with you.’ Mira said—‘All right! This is very good. First take your meals.’ Mira served him food with due respect and placing the bedstead before the group of the saints, she said—‘Maharaj! Do come.’ That evil-minded Sadhu came to her close and said secretly—‘Is the physical union of male and female possible in this way before so many persons?’ Mira said—‘Maharaj! What is that solitary place where my Girdharlal is not present? Wherever I cast my look, I find Him standing there. And again this body is the dwelling place of so many gods. The Moon, Sun, and the Stars are the witness of our every action. The angels of Yamraj remain constantly on watch, taking the round everywhere to maintain the account. When, all of them will see in such a situation, why do you feel shame only from the group of these Sadhus?’ When Mira replied loudly before all, then he felt ashamed. The people began to curse him. His infatuation was over. He fell on the feet of Mira and begged for pardon for his sin and asked the means of salvation. Mira said with great love—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मन रे परसि हरिके चरण॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुभग सीतल कँवल कोमल त्रिबिध ज्वाला-हरण।</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दासि मीरा लाल गिरधर अगम तारण तरण॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira says—‘O the mind! Touch the feet of the Lord. The feet of the Lord are soft and cool like the lotus flower and seizing all the three types of afflictions. Prahlad got the status of Indra by touching these feet. Those feet of the Lord initiated Dhruv to remain firm in his conviction taking him under His shelter. These feet assumed the entire universe with His nails and hair. Gautam’s wife got deliverance by touching those feet. Those feet subdued the ‘Kali Nag’ and made the frolicsome activities with the Gopis. ‘Those feet’ uplifting of Gobardhan mountain on His fingers shaded Gokul and thus, <br/>humiliated the arrogance of Indra. The maid Mira says that  Girdhari’s feet is the only means to get salvation.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira again said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राम नाम रस पीजै, मनुआँ राम नाम रस पीजै।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तज कुसंग सत्संग बैठ नित, हरि-चर्चा सुन लीजै॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">काम क्रोध मद लोभ मोहकूँ, बहा चित्तसे दीजै।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीराके प्रभु गिरधर नागर ताहिके रंगमें भीजै॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O mind! Drink the juice of Lord Ram’s name, O the mind! Taste this juice of Ram’s Name. Always live in the company of saints, leaving the company of evil  persons and listen to the sportive plays of the Lord. Sweep the emotions of passion, anger, arrogance, greed and infatuation out of your mind. Mira says that it is only Girdhar Nagar whose attachment will lead you to salvation.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira’s divine sermons changed pseudo-Sadhu into a true Sadhu. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that once, the Emperor Akabar taking Tansen with him, had visited Mira in the guise of a Vaishnav and being impressed by her wonderful  devotion, he had gone back, having gifted a very valuable garland to Ranchhodji. It also became a talk of the people. Being furious, Rana sent a small basket placing a black she-cobra in it in the name of Shaligramji’s idol for Mira’s destruction. Just hearing Shaligram’s name Mira’s eyes were filled with tears. She opened the covering of the basket with a great excitement; there she finds a very beautiful idol of Shri Shaligramji in reality and also there was a very charming garland of pleasant flowers. Mira began to dance getting the view of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मीरा मगन भई हरिके गुण गाय॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">साँप पिटारा राणा भेज्या, मीरा हाथ दिया जाय।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न्हाय-धोय जब देखन लागी, सालिगराम गयी पाय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Mira became overjoyed to sing the merits of the Lord. Rana had sent a basket of serpent, as a present in Mira’s hands. Mira performed her ablutions and <br/>put her hands in it, it was turned into an idol of Saligram.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘The Lord was always the protector of Mira, He used to remove her obstacles. She roams about in ecstatic mood arising out of deep love. She dedicated herself to girdhar.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ranaji tried to deviate Mira by so many other means also, but Mira did not deviate the least. When Rana began to torture Mira excessively, Mira wrote a letter to Gosai Tulasidasji—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्वस्तिश्री तुलसी गुण-भूषण दूषण हरण गोसाँई।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘May you be the happy. O the ornament of virtues, the remover of sorrows Tulasi! Again and again I salute you, now, remove my agony. All the dear ones of my household ever create trouble. While singing the reverential sing and going on in the association of Sadhus and saints, they are causing great distress to me. From the childhood I have made Girdhar my friend. The bonds of attachment have grown too strong for me now to break. You are like my mother and father and you are the source of pleasure for the devotees of the Lord. Kindly, write down in detail what would be proper for me at this moment.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswamiji Maharaj sent a hymn in reply of the letter—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जाके प्रिय न राम-बैदेही।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Despite being very close, the company of the person who has no love for Ram and Sita, must be shunned like a dire enemy. Prahlad defied his father, Vibhishan deserted his brother, Bharat forsook his mother, Bali disowned his preceptor. Nay the Gopis left their husbands for the sake of their love to the Lord Krishna and the behaviour of them all was a source of happiness and a blessing to the world at large. Whatsoever close and friend he may be, but not at the cost of  the love to Ram. Love to Ram should be the only cause of affinity to anyone. What is the use of antimony if it makes blind? What is more to say? Who generates love for Ram, deserves to be adored and he is dearer than life itself. He is beneficient in all respects.’ This is the creed of Tulasidas.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After reading this letter Mira decided to go to Vrindaban having abandoned her palace.* Ranaji was very happy with this news, but Udaji and Mira’s other beloved female friends felt very gloomy. They tried to check Mira, then Mira answered—</p>

With love and devotion I want to sing songs to Him. I will cling to the feet of the Lord. I will now make an instrument of this body. On it, I shall chant the melodies of Your name.

Be compassionate to me hurriedly. I am after all Your maidservant. My eyes are aching and are pining for a sight of Thee. My breaths are not flowing in regular course.

<p class="TEXT-English">The true devotees compel the Lord. Being compelled, the Lord had to come to Mira. Mira was charmed to see that outstanding beauty. Dancing she began to sing—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Mira sings—‘Today, I happened to see Girdhari. His face was charming. He was looking as if Cupid. His glance was unique. He was playing on flute in the bowers.

I wish that He should always remain in the core of my heart, day and night and even after trying to drive Him out. I sacrifice myself physically and mentaly on His lovely appearance.

I didn’t care for the family dignity and the comments of others. I lost my public shame, sitting in the company of the saints. Having torn the wedding ‘Chunari’ into two parts, I covered my body with a blanket. I put off all the garments of gem, pearls and jewels and wore the garland of wild flowers in the neck. I nourished the creeper of love watering it with my tears. Now, that creeper of love has spread and born, is the fruit of joy itself. I churned the milk with great love and took out the butter and anyone can drink the leavings butter-milk. I was born for Devotion but the world made my heart weep.

<p class="TEXT-English">Mira prays to the Lord—‘O Shyam! Girdharilalji! Take me in Your service. If I remain in Your service, I will plant the garden, and daily I will get <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>our vision In the bowers of Vrindaban I shall sing <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>our exploits.

The Lord blessed with His vision to Mira in the midnight on the river bank of love.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, Miraji visited Jiva Goswamiji, the great devotee pupil of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Vrindaban. Gosaiji conveyed the message from the inside that he does not meet the ladies. Then, Mira replied—‘Maharaj! In Vrindaban there was only one male person till today and He was Nandnandan and all others were ladies, today, you, too, have appeared as a male person.’ Hearing the mysterious answer of Mira, Maharaj came out bare-footed and met Mira with great love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Many of the poems of Mira indicate that Mira was the female pupil of the great devotee Raidasji; but one of the hymns also reveals  that Mira was the Vaishnavi of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu religious sect and probably, she had made Jiva Goswamiji as her preceptor. It may be possible she might have been intiated twice by the both at two times. The stanza of her prayer to Shri Chaitanya is as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अब तौ हरी नाम लौ लागी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सब जगको यह माखन-चोरा, नाम धरॺो बैरागी॥</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गौर-कृष्णकी दासी मीरा, रसना कृष्ण बसै॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Now, I am absorbed in repeating Hari name. This butter-thief of the world Shri Krishna assumed the name ‘Vairagi’ (detached). Where that charming Mohan left His flute, and where he got himself separated from all the Gopikas. Mohan got His head tonsured and tied the rope in His waist, and wore the cap on His head. It is the same Shyam Kishore whose legs were tied by Yashoda on account of butter. Shyam Kishore became ‘Nav-Gaura’ whose other name is Chaitanya. He wore loin cloth and displays as dressed in Pitambara. Mira says that she is the maidservant of Gour-Krishna and He always remains on her tongue.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Staying for some days at Vrindaban, Mira left for Dwarka and began to pass her time in the worship and reverential sing of Lord Shri Ranchhod. It is said that once, Ranaji had gone to Dwarka from Chittaur to call her back. After Mira’s departure, the disturbances and choas had started in Chittaur. The people coaxed Rana that he had disgraced a God-devotee like Mira and it is its result. So, having begged pardon from Mira, Rana wanted to take her back. But Mira did not agree to go back at any cost. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mira said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Ramaiya! I am totally soaked in Your colour. The husbands of other ones live abroad and they have their conversation through the letters but my dearest one resides in my heart and remains in my touch day and night. O my female friends! In the attractive garments, I go behind the bushes. There in the bushes my dearest Mohan meets me and I embrace Him in my arms. All my other female friends are intoxicated in the passion of their lovers but I am intoxicated even without drinking toxic. I take the drink from the distillery of love and remain intoxicated day and night. The regular lamp of His memory lightens and my mental concentration is the wick of the lamp and with the oil of the Devotion to the eternal, this lamp lightens day and night constantly. I hint the Lord Hari to come to His house from my parents house. Mira has her sole faith in Girdhar and her mind remains always concentrated to His feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Coming to the temple of Dwarikadhishji and being passionate in His love, Miraji began to sing— </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that near about 1630 Sambat, Mira had merged into the Lord. Mira had composed many volumes, which are not available at present. Mira’s reverential songs are popular. Whosoever sings or listens to them, becomes obsessed in the dvine love. Having taken birth in this world, Mira glorified and made India, the Hindu caste and the entire Lady-folk, sanctified and blessed.</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(Nabhaji)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Having given up the love for the mortal husband, she anchored herself to the feet of Lord Krishna. She sundered all fetters of the worldly attachment like breaking a straw. Blessed is the pious family Kanthdya and her father Parashuramji, who gave birth to her. It is well known that deserting her home, she made her permanent stay at Vrindaban. Saints were praising her non-attachment and love for God. Remaining detached from the taste of worldly comforts like vomitting, she never desired to get this human body again. Even in evil Kaliyuga, Karmaiti lived a spotless life.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The person who is charmed by the sweet image of Nandnandan dark coloured Mohan, becomes indifferent to the world and all the pleasures and comforts of this world appear insipid to him. Out of them even the comforts that separate from the Lord, appear to be poisonous. If the objects of the world are helpful in the Devotion to the Lord, if they are the worship materials of the dear Shyam, then they are acceptable and there is a great pleasure to have those objects because they are used in the adoration of the dearest Lord’s Lotus-feet. But the objects that are hindrance in the Lord’s love, are not at all required to be present. That is why the devotees either consider the whole world as the objects of the worship materials of the Lord or considering them an obstacle, give them up at all. In both cases the attachment to the worldly objects is to be given up. If there are somewhere the objects, they never remain as the objects of enjoyments. When the devotee surrenders himself completely to the feet of the Lord, where is the question of any object remains as the object of enjoyment for him? He, himself, belongs to the Lord and his all the belongings are the belongings of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Certainly anything that cannot be useful for or dear to God or that proves to be an obstruction in the surrender to the Lord, is always considered worth sacrificing. Keeping in mind the same, Karmaiti had made the long journey to Vrindaban forsaking paternal and in-laws houses.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is a place, named Khandela in Jaipur. There ruled the Sekhavat Sardar. Pt. Parashuramji was the family priest of the Khandela state. Karmaitibai was the virtuous daughter of the same fortunate Parashuramji. According to prenatal impressions, since childhood Karmaiti’s mind was devoted to Lord Krishna. Constantly she chanted Krishna’s name regularly and in any lonely place meditating on Shri Krishna, she used to call <br/>‘O the Lord! O the Lord!! While in the meditation tears flowed from her eyes. Her body used to get horripilated. In the passion of love, she laughed sometimes and sometimes she wept and sometimes she began to sing reverential sing in high pitch of melodious voice. All the family members and neighbouring persons were highly delighted to see the artless divine love of this small child. With the passage of time, Karmaiti grew to a marriageable age. The parents began to search out any worthy suitor. But the discussion of her marriage did not suit her mind. On account of shyness she said nothing before her parents but the talk about this matter seemed like poison to her. Unwillingly, she was married by the will of her father, but she had already surrendered herself to the Lord even before the marriage; nay, rather to say in the previous birth. How could she tolerate the right of any other one, on the possession of the Lord? She always used to meditate on the Lord of the Divine state of love, the constant novel, the young prince of everlasting beauty, Satchidanand of dark colour whom she had already choosen. Some days passed in this way, but one day, her in-laws came to take her away. She came to know that the members of the house, where she was married, did not have faith in God. They are against the Vaishnavas and saints. She would not get the opportunity of the service of Thakurji, and she would be bound to attach her mind and body to the worldly enjoyments. She got restless to think all about it and she began to weep to herself, remembering the Lord. She said—‘Lord! It is You only to save me from this distress. Will Your maidservant be compelled to become the maid of sensuousness? Will you not guide me any such means as I may mark my forehead with the holy dust of Braj reaching there?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the house, the parents are busy in the preparation to send off their daughter to her husband’s house, on the other side, Karmaiti’s mind is engrossed in her own otherwise thought. Being tired, all slept but Karmaiti is busy in making the above prayer to the Lord. All of a sudden, there was a thought in her mind that it was quite worthless and foolishness to live in the sensuous attachment of this world that deviates the mankind from the Lord forever. So, whatever may come, it is propitious for me in all respects to detach myself from all the worldly affairs. With this bent of mind, Karmaiti left her home around midnight and went out all alone ripping through the darkness fearlessly passing through the tranquility. Those, who go out being mad for that dearest of heart, have no fear at all. Karmaiti had never gone out of the house alone in the past, but she is running today in the mid of night forgetting everything. There is none with her. If there is anyone with her, that is the Lord Shyamsunder, the friend of devotees forever who has the only duty to protect the shelter-seeking devotees remaining with them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee Nabhaji describes— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आधी निसि निकसी यों बसी हिये मूरति सो,</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पूरन सनेह तनु-सुधि विसराई है।</p>

<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बहु दुरगन्ध सों सुगन्ध लों सराही है॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘In the mid of night, she left the house for the sake of that’ Image of the Lord’ which was deeply rooted in her heart. In the madness of His love she has forgotten the care of her body. In the morning, when it came to the knowledge of all, the parents got badly worried. They made all possible efforts to search her out from place to place. People ran towards all the directions, they searched her everywhere but she  hid herself in the skeleton of the camel. She escaped herself from the foul smell of the worldly objects and preferred the obnoxious smell considering it fragrant.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mad after the love of the Lord, Karmaiti is on her way passing through the darkness. She has no sense who is she and where is she going?</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दिसि अरु बिदिसि पंथ नहिं सूझा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">को मैं चलेउँ कहाँ नहिं बूझा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Shriramcharitmanas 3/9/6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘She has no consciousness of the path, quarters or intermediate directions, she does not know who I am and where I am going.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">She went on running only. It is not known how much distance she had covered in the night. The morning set in, but she is still running forgetting her hunger and thirst. On the other side, when Karmaiti’s mother did not find her daughter in the house in the morning, weeping she went to her husband Parashuram and told him this sad news. Parashuram was greatly shocked, first because of his daughter’s affection and secondly because of the public slander. Although he was confident that his daughter had gone somewhere on account of her detachment from the worldly objects and attachment to the divine love to the Lord; he was afraid of the public slander and meaningless false blames on his holy faithful daughter. He went to his client king being very much restless with these thoughts. Expressing sympathy to his grieved priest, the king sent his riders all around to search her. The two horse-riders went on that way also, on which Karmaiti was going on. From a distance, the hoof of the horse was heard by Karmaiti and then, she came to her senses, she guessed that certainly those riders were running after her but the question was where to hide herself. Neither there was any cave of the mountain nor was there any trace of trees. It was the open field like desert. At last, an idea came to her mind. There was lying a dead camel just nearby. The jackals and vultures had taken out the flesh of the camel, tearing out its stomach. His stomach had turned like a den. Karmaiti hid herself without thinking anything into the foul smelling skeleton of the camel. The riders did not look that side. They could not even halt there due to the excess of foul smell. For Karmaiti the foul smell of the worldly objects had become so unbearable that she ignored this foul smell of the skeleton to escape herself or for mad in love that devotee child, that foul smell turned into sweet fragrance by the grace of the Lord. By whose grace the fire had become cool and the poison had turned to nectar, It was not amazing to turn the foul smell to fragrance by His grace? For the continuous three days, Karmaiti remained there in the stomach of the camel in the meditation of dear Shyam. On the fourth day, she came out from there. At a short distance ahead, she got a company. After reaching Haridwar, first she took bath in the holy Bhagirathi; then, going on her way, she reached Vrindaban, place of the dark complexioned Krishna’s frolicsome activities. Those days, Vrindaban was the centre of the truly detached Vaishnav Sadhus. There used to be the crowd of the only mad God-devotees coming from all around and that is why that place was a very holy place and this is the reason of the devotees attraction to this place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching Vrindaban, Karmaiti felt as if drowned into the ocean of bliss. She began to live at Brahmakunda in the forest. Due to the break in boundary of Love-ocean, her life began to float into the constant great flow of love. Whence Parashuram could not find out her location, he reached Vrindaban in her search. How could Karmaiti be found out even in Vrindaban? Really, she was not any well known devotee to show her mimetic performance of devout love before the world. She remained lying alone in the forest absorbed in the love of Her dearest Lord. One day, climbing on a tree Parashuram saw a female dispassionate at Brahmakund. Immediately getting down, he at once, rushed up there. Reaching there he finds Karmaiti sitting there absorbed in meditation in the form of a female Sadhu. There is the glow of soft and cool lustre of the devotion on her face. There is the constant flow of the tears of love from her eyes. Parashuram got over-powered by the exultation and sorrow to see this condition of his daughter. There was sorrow to see her physical condition but a great exultation on her divine love. He was feeling blessed to be the father of such a devotee-goddess.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Many hours of Parashuram passed sitting there. He practically lost his consciousness to see her condition, but Karmaiti did not come to her senses. Ultimately, Parashuram brought her into senses by shaking her and asked her with earnest request to return back home and meditate and worship there and  Karmaiti said—‘Father! Is there anyone who has returned back after coming here? And as regards myself, I have already lost myself drowned in the ocean of love of my loving diety, I am already dead in spite of being physically alive. How will this corpse stand up from this place? Reaching home, you mutter the name of Shri Krishna alongwith my mother. There is no enjoyment in all the three worlds like this.’ While singing the praises of the Lord, Karmaiti fainted in the passion of love. The Brahmana Parashuram awakened her, cursing the worldly life and having made the promise to mutter and sing in the praise of Shri Krishna, returned therefrom for his house weeping. Having conveyed the news of his daughter to his wife after reaching home, he said to her—‘O the Brahman lady! You are blessed in the real sense that such an issue has been born of your womb. Today our clan got glorified and blessed.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the king heard this news, he also started for Vrindaban to have a glance of Karmaiti. After reaching Vrindaban, the king saw Karmaiti’s condition as deeply absorbed in love of the Lord. The king’s head bowed down devotedly at the feet of Karmaiti spontaneously. The king importuned to get a cottage built, but Karmaiti went on refusing. At last, on the insistence of the king, Karmaiti did not create any obstacle in getting the cottage built. The king got a hermitage built. It is heard that the ruins of Karmaiti’s hermitage are still remaining.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Karmaitibai lived with a spirit of renunciation. Her mind always remained passionate to get the vision of Shri Krishna in person. There remained always rainy season in her eyes. In this way, remaining absorbed in dire penance, at last, this ascetic goddess left for divine abode by givng up this body.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Janabai</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Love is dear to God; He becomes his own who likes Him sincere-heartedly. Caste, knowledge, talent, wealth and prosperity, nothing is desirable in the love of Lord. Either male or female, a scholar or a fool, a king or destitute, a Brahman or a pariah, whosoever remembers Him with love, attains Him. The devotee Janabai was the maidservant in the house of the reputed devotee Shri Namdevji. Sweeping the rooms, cleanse the utensils, clothes and fetch the water etc., and all the domestic chores was her duty. Just as Divine sage Naradji in his previous birth had become the dearest one of the Lord by serving the sages and seers, in the same way the seed of love for God germinated in simple heart of Janabai, by the impact of the discussions and discourses of the Lord and congregational gathering taking place in the house of the foremost devotee Shri Namdevji. The love to the Name of the Lord developed in her mind. Anyone can never forget him or her whom he or she loves from the core of the heart. In the same way, Janabai also was remembering constantly the Lord-name. As by degrees her repeatings of the Lord-name increased, correspondingly, her sins began to burn out and the novel plant of love began to flourish and a strong tree and its roots began to spread all around.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the Ekadashi day, the groups of devotees have gathered in the house of Namdevji and wakefulness on the religious occasion in the night is going on. All are engrossed in the muttering and reverential sing of the Lord’s name. Some are singing, some play on the drum, some cymbal and some clap their palms. The devotees are overwhelmed in love, none has care for his body and mind, someone dances, someone sings and some are shedding tears and someone is laughing as if intoxicated. None thinks of how long the night has passed. Janabai, too, is staggering standing in the corner intoxicated by divine love. Thus, the jocund night spreading the immense joy passed very soon. The dawn set in. The people went away to their residences. Janabai also went to her home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the arrival at home, Janabai lay down a little. The hangover of love had not lost completely yet. She remained lying down in the same condition. The sun has risen. Janabai got up and was perturbed to see the sun-rise. She thought that she was too late. Her master would have felt great inconvenience for sweeping of the house and cleaning the utensils. Washed her hands and face, she, at once, started for her workplace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was too late. Being perturbed, Janabai got herself engaged in finishing the hand-work hurriedly. But the work is not finished in hurry and worry. On the other hand, the delay in one work makes the system disturbed and it causes delay in all the works to be done. Here, also it happened so, she has to sweep the house, to clean the utensils, to fetch the water and to wash the clothes and so on.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having finished some work, she reached the bank of the river, Chandrabhaga to wash the clothes. She had hardly started to wash the clothes, then a very important work came to her memory, which would cause a great trouble to Namdevji if it had not been done at once, she walked to her lord’s house. On the way, abruptly, a stranger old woman said very affectionately to Jana, catching the corner of her Saree—‘Bai Jana! <span class="char-style-override-6">w</span>hy are you running so perturbed in this way? What is so important work?’ Jana told her frankly about the work. The old woman said in loving voice—‘Don’t worry. Go and complete your household work, and in this period, I just wash your clothes.’ Janabai said—‘No mother! <span class="char-style-override-6">d</span>on’t take trouble for me, I just come back.’ Smiling the old woman answered—‘I will feel no trouble in this work; it is very easy for me to do any job, I am used of doing all sorts of work always. I am in practice of doing the works. Even then, if your conscience does not allow you, you may help me sometime.’ Janabai was in hurry to reach the home; On the other side there was the affectionate sentiment in the words of the old woman. She could speak nothing and praising the helping attitude of the old woman to herself, she went away. How was it known to her that the old woman was not a common woman rather than she was the mother of the universe, Sachchidanandmayi Jagajjanani itself in person.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The old woman washed the clothes in no time. Along with the clothes, actions of the wearing person and its bearer also were washed away. After a while, Janabai came back. She felt very much obliged to see the cloths already washed. She said to the old woman—‘Mother! I caused you a great trouble today. The helping mothers like you are just like the Almighty God.’ Jana! You are misunderstanding. This old woman is not like God but the Goddess Mother of the universe appeared in the guise of an old woman.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The old woman said smiling—‘Janabai! I didn’t feel the least trouble, was it any difficult work? Take your these clothes, I, now, go away.’ Saying so, the old woman went away therefrom. Jana had been overwhelmed with the great affection of the old woman. She could not feel even that the old woman was going away. Jana began to collect the clothes, but in the meantime the thought came to her mind—‘This old lady has done such a favour to me by her help, at least let me ask her name and address, so that I may visit her and render her my services.’ The old woman had gone just a little before. Jana looked all around, ran towards the way, searched about all around but the old woman could not be traced out, and how was it possible also?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being disappointed, Jana came back to the river bank and reached Namdev’s residence with the clothes from there. Saint Jana’s mind was restless for the old lady. While going, God knows what spell had she cast which Jana could not understand at all. This is the fact also. This sorceress was really very apt. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was the time of the association of saints. The group of saints was gathering. Reaching there, Jana started relating her condition to Namdevji. While speaking, Jana’s throat got choked. Having heard the entire occurrence, the devotee Namdevji came to know the sportive activity of the frolicsome Actor and he absorbed himself in divine love while admiring in his mind itself the affection of the Lord towards His devotee. Then, he said—‘Jana! <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>ou are the most fortunate; The Lord has bestowed upon you a great grace—She was not a common old woman; He was the Narayan Himself in the guise of the old woman, who had come uncalled for to share your work out of love.’ Just hearing this, Janabai began to weep in love and began to curse herself for causing trouble to the Lord. The whole group of the saints became horripilated with joy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that Janabai’s love to the Lord, later on, had strengthened much and the Lord used to oblige her by showing her His appearance from time to time. While grinding with a hand-mill, she used to sing the ‘Rhythm’ in the love of the Lord. While singing when she lost her sense overwhelmed by love, the Lord, Himself, grinded in her place and used to feel happy hearing Jana’s Rhythms. The Maharashtrian poets ‘grinded the hand-mill with Jana’ this hymn used to sing so. In the Maharashtra state Janabai holds a very dignified status.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Be it man, woman or one lacking the characteristics of both, or, for the matter of that, any living being whatsoever of the animate or inanimate world––he who adores Me with all his being, giving up all guile, is supremely dear to Me.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has been said by the God (Shri Krishna) in the Gita—</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(9/32)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Arjun! Women, Vaishyas, Shudras and those born of sinful species, whosoever, come to My shelter, attain the highest good. The Lord is pleased only by Love. He never cares for the caste, wealth and prosperity, knowledge, talent etc., or any other thing. Anyone, free from all sorts of infatuation, surrenders oneself to the feet of the Lord, the Lord becomes his own. He wants the true sentiment of the heart; the profound love of the innerself. He is sold there by Himself where these objects are found.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1200 years back, Rabia was born in a poor Muslim family in the city named Basara in Turkistan. Rabia was his fourth daughter. Rabia’s mother had died in even her childhood. Her father also passed away when Rabia was only twelve years old leaving her as orphan. Rabia was leading her life in great hardships. Once, it was a fierce famine in the country, which separated her from her sisters also. Some wicked one sold Rabia to any rich man by coaxing her. The rich man was of selfish and cruel nature. The slave Rabia purchased by paying money, began to be tortured in many ways. Abusing and beating was very common. It is but natural for those, intoxicated by sensuous passion. Being distressed by the hardships, Rabia used to express her sorrow weeping before God silently in secluded place. In the universe except the Lord, there was none to console her. Who one else except the Helper of the helpless could be there to console that poor orphan?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being perplexed by the torture of the master, one day, Rabia escaped away to get rid of the master; but the God’s will was somewhat otherwise. After going a little while, she fell down by tripping her foot against something and as a result her right hand got fractured. This was her misfortune one after another. After the awful darkness of the night of the new moon there occurs the sunrise of the fortnight. After the limit of the bad days, the good days happen to come. Being nervous from this new calamity, Rabia fell to weep and taking the shelter of the only supporter of the destitutes, the Lord, she said—‘O my kind-hearted master! I have been suffering since birth, the orphan girl, deprived of mother and father. I was passing my life anyhow like a prisoner, my hand also got fractured. Will you not be pleased with me? Tell me my Lord! Why are you displeased with me?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia’s pathetic words passing through the space, reached that divine world and reached the heart of the Lord entering through His divine ears. Rabia heard the divine voice; as if the Lord Himself were saying—‘Daughter! Don’t worry. Your all the worries will be over soon. Your glory will spread over the whole earth. Even the gods will respect you. The true pathetic prayer gets response at once.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the divine voice, her joys had no bound. She now became fully hopeful and courageous. She thought—‘If the Lord is pleased with me and gifting me His grace, then, what is difficult to bear the sufferings like the touch of the delicate flowers with joyous heart?’ Forgetting the pain of her fractured hand, Rabia came back to her master’s house gladly. But since today her life took a turn. In spite of remaining busy in her work,  her mind remained attached to the feet of the Lord. She began to pray remaining awakened throughout the night. Due to divine adoration, her lustre waxed. One day, in the midnight, Rabia was offering prayer in the pathetic tone sitting on her knees in her lonely room. By the inspiration of God, at the same time, her master also got awakened from the sleep. He heard very sweet and pitious voice. Instantly getting up and guessing it Rabia’s voice, he came to the gate of Rabia’s room. From the back of the curtain he saw that there was divine light in the room. Rabia is praying without wink. He heard Rabia’s words—‘O my Master! Now, I want to obey You only, but what should I do, I don’t find myself able to do that much what I want? I am a purchased slave? I don’t find time from the chores of slavery.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord of the poor people heard her prayer and by His inspiration, the house-master’s mind changed that very moment. He got amazed to see the beautiful lustrous and glorious face of Rabia and hearing devotional pathetic prayer. He came near Rabia slowly and slowly. He saw the divine glow on the Rabia’s face of devotional sentiment and on her shining forehead. The same divine glow was as if spreading the light in the whole house. He got frightened and astonished to see this sight. He thought that he had done a great injustice—he had committed a great sin to enslave such a pious and adorable goddess. It is my duty to serve such a devotee goddess of the Lord. A great reverence developed in his mind for Rabia. He said in a very humble way— ‘Goddess! I was unable to recognise you till now. By the grace of the Lord, today I came to realise your value. Now, you need not serve me. Stay in my house comfortably. Now I will serve you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia said—‘Master! I don’t want to take your service, You gave me food to eat for so many days, keeping me in your house; I am very much obliged to you, now, kindly free me to go anywhere else so that I may sing in praise of God happily sitting at any secluded place.’ The master granted the prayer of Rabia. Now, Rabia began to pass her whole time in the meditation and reverential sing. The ocean of love began to splash in her heart. There remained no trace of the worldly attachment at all. Rabia surrendered her entire life completely at the feet of love itself—God. Ponder over some sermonical occurences of Rabia’s life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, Rabia was sitting sad. One of the visitors of her vision asked—‘Why do you look sad today?’ Rabia answered—‘Today in the morning my mind had been diverted towards the heaven, friend of my innerself has rebuked me for this. That is why I am sad as why was my unstable mind had diverted towards otherside forgetting my friend.’ Rabia adored the Lord as her friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, Rabia was seriously ill. One Sadhak named Sufian, visited her. Seeing Rabia’s condition of disease, Sufian was very much shocked; but due to hesitation he could say nothing. Then, Rabia said to him—‘Brother! If you want to say something, speak.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sufian said—‘Devi! Pray to the Lord and the Lord will certainly cure you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Smiling Rabia answered—‘Sufian! Do you not know on whose hint disease is caused? Is it not by divine dispensation?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sufian—‘Yes, ‘What happens without His will?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia—‘If it is so, then how are you telling me to pray to Him to get rid of this disease against His will? Is it proper for a beloved to act against His will, who is my great friend and whose every dispensation is love?’ What an appreciating surrender is!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sufian asked—‘Do you want to eat something?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia—‘You know it very well, I wanted to eat dates. I have been living here for ten years, there is no want of dates here, but till now, I have not tasted a single date, I am the maidservant of that Lord. Where is the question of a subservient’s desire? Whatever I desire, if that is against my Lord’s will, that is completely worth abandoning for me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, the Saint Hussain Basari asked Rabia—‘Do you want to marry?’ Rabia answered—‘Marriage is ceremonised with body, but where is body with me? I surrendered this body along with my mind and heart to the hands of the Lord, now, this body is under His control and it has been engaged in His purpose. How and with whom should I marry?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia had dedicated her everything to the hands of the Lord. She had nothing with her to consider or to say it her ‘own’ except the Lord. Once, Hussain Basari asked—‘Devi! How did you attain such a high spiritual evolution?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia—‘I have got it, having lost all that what I had been endowed with.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hussain—‘Have you ever seen that God whom you worship?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia—How would I worship if I had not seen? But it is impossible to string Him in words. He is immeasurable. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the course of discussion, one day, Hussain Basari began to say to Rabia—‘In the divine world if  mind is deviated from the Lord even for a moment, I will weep and wail so bitterly that gods will pity me.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia said—‘It is a very good thing, but why is it not practised here in this world? If it happens here in this world, only then it is possible in the next world.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia loved everyone, she was kind to all whether sinner or ascetic. One day, a man asked Rabia—‘Is’nt that you consider the demon like sin as your enemy?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia said—‘Due to being obsessed with love of God, neither I bore enmity with anyone, nor had I to quarrel with anybody. By divine grace, I have no enemy at all.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, some people went to Rabia. Rabia asked one of them—‘Brother! Why do you serve God?’ He said—‘To get rid of the terrible pain of the hell.’ On the same question to the second one, he said—‘The heaven is the most pleasant place, there are different types of objects for enjoyment and unlimited joy, and to get that joy, I am devoted to the Lord.’ Rabia said—‘They are the ignorant devotees who adore the Lord out of fear or greed. It is better than at least, not to do it, but suppose, if there had been neither heaven nor hell both, would you have worshipped the Lord? The true devotee does not worship the Lord to fulfil his desire, either in this world or in the next world, that is performed not for any desire of this world or the next world.’ It is motiveless. What an ideal picture of the Devotion is!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once, a rich man went to Rabia with a bag of money along with Hussain Basari and he requested to accept the money. Rabia said—‘In this world those who talk ill of the Lord, are not even deprived of the food by the supreme Lord in annoyance; then why is He going to be miser for His servant? Since the moment, I have realised His such greatness, I have even no lurking desire to get anything. Well! Tell me what will I do with this money?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same way, once a rich man, seeing Rabia in the old and tattered clothes, said—‘O the female austere! If you permit, your this servant is ready to free you from this poverty.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia—‘I feel very much ashamed to demand anything from anyone to eradicate the worldly poverty when entire universe is the kingdom of the Lord, then, why to demand anything from anyone leaving that Lord? If I need, I will take myself from the Hands of the Lord.’ What a wonderful dependence? </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once a man said seeing the broken pot and torn bedding of Rabia—‘Goddess! I have got close relations with so many rich persons, if you permit I should bring the necessary items for you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia—‘You are committing a great blunder; none of them is my food-giver, He, who infuses life in true sense, has forgotten the poors due to their poverty? Does He remember the rich only because of their riches?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sometimes Rabia used to call very loudly obsessed with divine love. The people began to ask her—‘Why do you cry loudly sometimes without any disease or distress?’ Rabia answered—‘I don’t have any external disease which the worldly people may realise. I have the internal disease, which is beyond the control of any Vaidya or Hakim. My this disease can be cured only by the vision of the enchanting face of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rabia’s mind always remained engrossed in the meditation of the Lord, She passed her time in the contemplation of the Lord day and night. Once, Rabia prayed to the Lord—‘O my Master! It is You only all in all for me, I want nothing but You. O Lord! Burn me to ashes in the fire of hell, if I worship you out of the fear of hell Close the gate of the heaven forever, if I serve You in the greed of heaven, and if I worship You only for Your sake, then, oblige me by blessing me with the vision of Your beautiful bright form.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The remaining life of Rabia passed in a very high devotional state. She remained overwhelmed with bliss by watching the outstanding splendour of her Supreme friend all around. One day, in the night, so long as the moon light remained diffusing, Rabia was absorbed in the delight of the gleam’ of any other divine creation inside her hut. In the meanwhile, an acquanited lady called Rabia absorbed in meditation from the outside of the hut; ‘Rabia! Come out and see how beautiful the night is! At that time, the sea waves of that beauty were rising in her heart, in comparison to which the entire beauty of the universe is not equal to even a drop of that ocean. She said—‘Just see entering my heart once, what a unique beauty transcending, the beauty of the world is!’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In Hijary year 135, Rabia abandoned this mortal body anchoring her mind in the Lord.</p>
