## CLXXXIII

*To Sister Christine*

6, PLACE DES ETATS-UNIS, PARIS

*23rd August 1900*

DEAR CHRISTINE,

What is the matter with you? Are you ill? Unhappy? What makes you
silent? I had only one little note from you in all this time.

I am getting a bit nervous about you — not much. Otherwise I am enjoying
this city. Did Mrs. A. P. Huntington write you?

I am well — keeping well as far as it is possible with me.

With love,  
VIVEKANANDA
