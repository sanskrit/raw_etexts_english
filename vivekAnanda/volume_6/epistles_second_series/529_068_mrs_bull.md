## LXVIII

54 WEST 33rd STREET, NEW YORK,  
*June, 1895*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I have just arrived home. The trip did me good, and I enjoyed the
country and the hills, and especially Mr. Leggett's country-house in New
York State. Poor Landsberg has gone from this house. Neither has he left
one his address. May the Lord bless Landsberg wherever he goes! He is
one of the few sincere souls I have had the privilege in this life to
come across.

All is for good. All conjunctions are for subsequent disjunction. I hope
I shall be perfectly able to work alone. The less help from men, the
more from the Lord! Just now I received a letter from an Englishman in
London who had lived in India in the Himalayas with two of my brethren.
He asks me to come to London.

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
