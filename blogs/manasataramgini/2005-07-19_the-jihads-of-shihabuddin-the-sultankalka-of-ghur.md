title = "The Jihads of Shihabuddin, the Sultankalka ofxa0Ghur"

+++
Around 1140, the Islamized Turko-Mongol chiefs of the Shansabanid tribe
occupied Ghor in Afghanistan. Initially it was a vassal of the Ghaznavid
Sultans, but around 1130 it came into conflict with them, after one of
the leading Shansabanid nobles was murdered by the Ghaznavid Sultan,
Bahram. A ferocious war ensued between the Sultans of Ghor and Ghazni,
till Alla-ud-din Ghori invaded Ghazni with his entire cavalry and
wrested it from Bahram. Alla-ud-din sacked the Indian spoils that Mahmud
had placed there, massacred the city’s population in a 7-day killing
spree and subsequently burnt it down. The next Ghaznavid Sultan, Khushro
Maliq was driven out of Afghanistan by a coalition of Oghuz Turks and
the Ghorids in 1157, and the Oghuz took Ghazni. The sons of Alla-ud-din,
Ghiyas-ud-din Mu’azz-ud-din Ghori and Shihab-ud-din Muhammad Ghori
defeated the Oghuz and annexed Ghazni in 1174. Ghiyas-ud-din, crowned
himself Sultan, and appointed his brother Sultankalka. Shihab-ud-din was
assigned the task of extending the kingdom to the East and he naturally
gravitated towards India. 13 bloody campaigns that ravaged Northern
India followed:  
· Early in 1175 he invaded Punjab and sacked and burned Uch…(1)  
· In 1178 he advanced south and marched towards Gujarat, but here the
Indians acted quickly and rallying under the western chAlukya king
MUlarAja II routed the Islamic forces completely forcing him to
retreat…(2)  
· In 1179 Ghori sent a message to PrithivirAja chAhamAna to make common
cause with him against the Chalukyas. Prithivaraj however, wisely
disregarding his foolish minister, kadambavAsa’s advise to make a common
cause with Ghori, preemptively attacked NaDDula and reconquered it from
the Moslems.  
· Shihab recovered in 1180 and invaded Sindh and ravaged the population
carrying away much loot…(3)  
· Then Shihabuddin Muhammad, quickly followed it up in 1181 and 1184
with two invasions of Lavapura (Lahore) accompanied with much
slaughter…(4+5)  
· In 1186 he invaded the Ghaznavid-occupied Punjab and defeated the
Sultan Khushro Maliq and wrested Punjab…(6)  
· 1188 The Ghur Sultankalka invaded the ChAhamAna kingdom and sacked the
fort of Tabarhindah killing the Hindu male populace and raping the
women. Hindu refugees flocked around Delhi alarming the ChAhamAnas…(7)  
· 1191 PrithivirAj advanced to meet Shihabuddin’s raid and routed him in
the great battle of Tarai. While the Muslims suffered a crushing defeat,
the Indians failed to butcher them to man and allowed Shihab to get away
unharmed. He fled back to Central Asia leaving Punjab completely
undefended…(8)  
· 1191 PrithivirAj attacked Tabarhindah and took it back from the
Muslims. Here the biggest mistake of the Hindus was not to reconquer and
arm Punjab suitably.  
· 1192 Shihab returned and sacked Tabarhindah again. This was followed
by the second battle of Tarai, the ChAhamAna army was crushed and
Prithiviraj was captured and brutally tortured to death…(9)  
· 1192 the Ghur Sultankalka made a second trust towards Ajayamerupura
(Ajmer) and sacked it smashing Hindu temples and a Hindu university in
course of this invasion. The Hindus captured in this expedition caused
slave prices to fall to a few Dirhams in the Muslim markets…(10)  
· 1193 The sultankalka invaded Kannauj and slew the GAhadwala king
Jayachandra. He followed this up with an invasion of vArANsipura
slaughtering Hindus with great savagery and desecrating the holy
city…(11+12)

After this, his viceroy Kutub-ud-din (also his lover?) and the Turkish
adventurer Ikhtiyaruddin Khalji furthered the violence of Islam in the
land of Hind. Meanwhile Shihab’s brother died in Ghazna and he crowned
himself Sultan and immediately launched himself into another Jihad on
the infidels of Hindustan in 1206. The exact course of this campaign is
not clear. While on the North-western reaches of the Sindhu, he was
ambushed by the Khokar chiefs and shot down by an arrow…(13). Thus ended
the carrier of the Moslem brigand who brought misery to the whole of
northern India through his 13 invasions.
