common parent and thereby potential rivals due to lower gene-sharing
that real sibs.

bhrAtR^ivya- a rival. Bears a connection with the word bhrAta, meaning
brother. Members of the same brotherhood may have intense competition
for lebensraum. Eg. duryodhana and yuddhiShThira

ari- a rival. Could also mean, in-laws or the exogamous community with
