## CIX

THE MATH, BELUR,  
*6th July, 1901*.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

Things come to me by fits — today I am in a fit of writing. The first
thing to do is, therefore, to pen a few lines to you. I am known to be
nervous, I worry much; but it seems, dear Christine, you are not far
behind in that trick. One of our poets says, "Even the mountains will
fly, the fire will be cold, yet the heart of the great will never
change." I am small, very, but I know you are great, and my faith is
always in your true heart. *I worry about everything except you*. I have
dedicated you to the Mother. She is your shield, your guide. No harm can
reach you — nothing hold you down a minute. I know it.

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
