## XLVII

*To Miss Emma Thursby*

CHICAGO

541 DEARBORN AVENUE

*17 January 1895*

DEAR MISS THURSBY,

I am very sorry to learn about the passing on of Mr. Thorp.[1](#fn1)
Mrs. Bull must have felt it deeply. Still he has passed on after a good
and useful life. All is for the best.

I have been lecturing every day to a class in Mrs. Adams's[2](#fn2)
rooms at the Auditorium. Today I also lecture there and in the Evening
to a class of Miss Josephine Locke's[3](#fn3) at the Plaza Hotel.

Have you seen Mrs. Peake[4](#fn4) in New York? She is lecturing to a
class at Mrs. Guernsey's.

Miss Locke is as kind as usual. She is enamoured of Mrs. Peake as are
many of Miss Locke's friends, you will be glad to learn.

Mrs. Peake has made a very favourable impression on Chicago. So she does
wherever she goes.

Mrs. Adams invited me to an organ concert in the Auditorium. She is so
good and kind to me. Lord bless her.

I have not seen Mr. Young, nor, I am afraid, \[will\] I have time to see
\[him,\] as I start for New York on Friday next.

I will hear him once in New York.

I was so busy here these two weeks.

I have got a new scarlet coat but can get no orange here.

Ever with blessings,

Your brother,  
VIVEKANANDA
