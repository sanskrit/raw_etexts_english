## KALI THE MOTHER

  The stars are blotted out,  
                       The clouds are covering clouds,  
         It is darkness vibrant, sonant.  
                 In the roaring, whirling wind  
             Are the souls of a million lunatics  
                         Just loose from the prison-house,  
        Wrenching trees by the roots,  
               Sweeping all from the path.  
     The sea has joined the fray,  
                     And swirls up mountain-waves,  
 To reach the pitchy sky.  
      The flash of lurid light

Reveals on every side  
                   A thousand, thousand shades  
             Of Death begrimed and black —  
                      Scattering plagues and sorrows,  
Dancing mad with joy,  
        Come, Mother, come!  
For Terror is Thy name,  
        Death is in Thy breath,  
And every shaking step  
             Destroys a world for e'er.  
            Thou "Time", the All-Destroyer!  
           Come, O Mother, come!  
Who dares misery love,  
               And hug the form of Death,  
        Dance in Destruction's dance,  
             To him the Mother comes.
