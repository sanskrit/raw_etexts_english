## LXXVIII

*To Sister Christine*

228 W. 39TH STREET  
NEW YORK

*December 24, 1895*

DEAR CHRISTINA —

Merry Christmas and happy New Year to you. I am going today to the
country. I return in 10 days.

About the tour through Detroit — I will fix it later on. I am afraid if
I go just now, everything here will fall to pieces.

I will come anyway, but I am afraid it will be later than I expected.

My love to Mrs. Phelps, Mrs. Phunkey \[Funke\] and all our friends and
Christmas greetings.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Kripananda sends his greetings too.

V.
