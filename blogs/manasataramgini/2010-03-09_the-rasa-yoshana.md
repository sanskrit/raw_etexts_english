The rasAyana texts developing in the bhairava-srotas of the
shaiva-shAsana furnish a remarkable myth about the extraction of mercury
in the darada country. One instance of this myth is found in the
Anandakanda:  
Anandakanda 1.1.53cd-1.1.62ab

Having bathed after her first menstruation, a good looking maiden with
auspicious features, clad in clean garments, wearing garlands, smeared
with perfumes, well-adorned and abstaining from sexual activities mounts
a good horse.

Having first worshipped the lord of the gaNa-s, bhairava and preceptor
at the inception one meditates on rasendra-bhairava in the mercury
situated in the \[mercurial\] well

tadAnIm Aharet-tatu kumArI saMjighR^ikShayA |

At that instance, from the midst of the mercurial well, the Hg seized
with the desire to grab the maiden, springs forth and rushes after her.

pashyech-ChIghraM tato gachChet na punaH pR^iShTham IkShayet |  
eShA yojana-mAtrA kumArI hayasAdhanA || 57

On seeing the Hg, without looking behind again, quickly the maiden rides
away on her horse for the distance of a yojana.

After reaching a yojana (in her pursuit) the Hg rapidly subsides into
the mercurial well. While making the return it gets trapped into
hollows. Having become pure the rasa-deshika takes possession of that
mercury.

The alchemical master by means of tantric insights knows that due its
weight the Hg fell from the mouth of fire in the country known as darada
and was absorbed by the earth.

pArado gR^ihyate devi doSha-hInas sa uchyate |

Having cast that ore (see below) into the retort assembled for
distillation, O goddess he obtains the Hg that said to be free from
impurities.

evam eva tatra tatra siddha-vidyAdharais sadA || 61  
nikShepitaH pAradendro vidyate devi siddhidaH || 62ab 

O goddess, verily, wherever the lordly mercury is thus extracted by the
siddha-vidyAdhara-s it is known to be the granter of success.

Though wrapped in a mythical form the tale gives an important insight
into the geographical source of mercury for the Hindu tAntrika-s. It is
well-known that despite the fame of rasAyana in India, mercury is
extremely rare and the modern Indian government issued a statement that
it possesses no workable mercurial deposits after commissioning an
exploration for the same in the 1960-70s. This fact has been exploited
by the white sinophilists to claim that rasAyana came to India from the
chIna-s. However, we have the evidence of the chIna-s themselves that
their daoistic mercurial chemistry was influenced by the bhArata-s. So
the big question was where did the Hindus get their mercury from? The
above narrative refers to the source of mercury known to the tAntrika-s
to be the darada-desha. A similar narrative is also found in the
rasendrachUDAmaNI suggesting that it was a persistent theme. Now kalhaNa
in describing the conquests of the great kArkoTaka emperor lalitAditya
mentions that the darada country lies to the north of the kambhoja-s of
the upper Punjab, the Tibetans and tukhAra-s. The descriptions of
uttarApatha in the purANa-s also generally match with this location of
the darada-s. This is also confirmed by the location the tukhAra-s
described by the chIna scholar/spy Xuanzang. This, is consistent with
the darada-s lying in what is today Tajikistan. A relatively obscure
fact is that Tajikistan contains a rather rich deposit of
antimony-mercury (in some cases also with gold) that the Russian
geologists had established to be of hydrothermal origin. Several
features of the above tAntrika myth might fit such a deposit: Firstly,
the wells mentioned in the account could correspond to the hydrothermal
springs that are central to the deposition of elemental mercury from
such ore accumulations. Secondly, the geothermal conditions could also
achieve sufficiently high temperatures for the normally stable cinnabar
and metacinnabar (sulfides of mercury) to partially dissociate releasing
mercury. Thirdly the hydrothermal conditions also allow two means of
mercury transport from greater depth to the surface â€“ namely as dry
vapor or as aqueous Hg0. This is transport is what is alluded to as the
leaping of the mercury from the well when the maiden rides by. The
falling of Hg due to its weight from the mouth of agni is again an
allusion to the deposition of liquid elemental mercury following
transport from a hydrothermal system.

Finally, what does the horse-riding mercury-magnet-maiden mean? Is it
just a myth or a cryptic allusion to an alchemical process we fail to
understand?
