BELUR MATH,  
DIST. HOWRAH,  
*14th February, 1901*.

MY DEAR JOE (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)

I am ever so glad to hear that Bois is coming to Calcutta. Send him
immediately to the Math. I will be here. If possible I will keep him
here for a few days and then let him go again to Nepal.

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.
