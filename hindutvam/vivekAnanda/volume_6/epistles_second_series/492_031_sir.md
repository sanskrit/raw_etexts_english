## XXXI [1](#fn1)

(*Translated from [Bengali](b6045e6031.pdf)* )

GHAZIPUR,  
*2nd April, 1890*.

DEAR SIR,

Where shall I get that renunciation you speak of in your advice to me?
It is for the sake of that very thing that I am out a tramp through the
earth. If ever I get this true renunciation, I shall let you know; and
if you get anything of the kind, please remember me as a partner
thereof. 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,
    xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written
    to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose
    profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These
    letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a
    time when, after his Master's passing away, Swamiji was leading a
    wandering monk's life. In the early days he used to sign his name as
    Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in
    all these pages for easy comprehension.
