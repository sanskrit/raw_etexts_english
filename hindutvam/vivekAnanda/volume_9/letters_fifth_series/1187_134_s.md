## CXXXIV

*To Swami Swarupananda, editor of* Prabuddha Bharata, *Mayavati*

\[*March 1899*\]

MY DEAR S\[WARUPANANDA\],

I have no objection whether Mrs. Sevier's name goes on top or mine or
anybody else's; the prospectus ought to go in the name of the Seviers,
mustering my name also if necessary. I send you a [few
lines](../../volume_5/writings_prose_and_poems/the_advaita_ashrama_himalayas.htm)
for your consideration in the prospectus. The rest are all right.

I will soon send the draft deed.

V.
