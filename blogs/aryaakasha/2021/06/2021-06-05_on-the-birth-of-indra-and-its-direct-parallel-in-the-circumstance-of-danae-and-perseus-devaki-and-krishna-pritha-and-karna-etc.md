The exercise of the sincere reconstruction of the archaic Indo-European
mythology is an art. Its major formulations, have become fragmentary –
and it is only via the re-alignment of several spheres that we are able
to more truly glimpse what our more distant ancestors believed.

However, this is not an entirely abstract pursuit – it has tangible
relevancy and saliency also for the understanding of the rather more
recently congealed mythoi of the descendant Indo-European peoples, as
well. We provide the structures which facilitate the interpretation, and
chart the developed course, for these younger faiths from far more
ancient foundations. And in so doing, we shed light upon quandaries
which have conflicted minds for centuries when considered only in
isolation.

So it is with RV IV 18 – well, certain lines therein, at any rate.

We shan’t look at the full Hymnal, nor at the grand scoping mythology of
Indra from whence it hails. But rather at one feature in particular
contained therein – which is also a shared feature of the ‘origin
stories’ of both Perseus and Krishna, as well as Karna. And, I should
therefore surmise, presents quite a strong candidate for a feature of
the more archaic Proto-Indo-European mythology of the Striker/Thunderer
deific.

That is the notion that this deific, as part of His early circumstances,
is set adrift upon the waters – as the result of some circumstance in
which His Mother is ‘shamed’.

We see this most clearly via the origins of Perseus, wherein Perseus’
Mother (Danae – a name which, itself, is suitably ‘watery’ via
etymology) is first imprisoned in order to prevent the conception of
such a powerful figure (a Son of Zeus, as it turns out), and then when
this fails … both mother and child are set adrift upon the storm-tossed
waters by their would-be captor, as he fears the consequences of killing
them directly himself.

In the case of Krishna, similar events transpire. A female with a
certain meaningful name (Devaki – ‘Celestial’ or ‘Divine’, and Herself
identified as a resonacy of Aditi … the Wife of the Sky Father and
Mother of Indra in Vedic perspective) is imprisoned in order to prevent
the conception of a youth Who shall set things back to rights. The
Father here is Vasudeva – a name with clear resonancy with the Sky
Father deific when we consider both the meaning of ‘Vasu’ (‘Light’) and
the identities of many of \*the\* Vasus elsewhere in Vedic
understanding. And, once again, once the conception has been brought to
fruition, the infant Krishna is set adrift upon the waters of a nearby
river, in a storm.

And then there is Karna – Son of the Sun (Surya), by the Mother Pritha
(a clear resonancy of Prithvi (‘Earth’), even despite ‘Pritha’
ostensibly meaning ‘Hand’), set adrift upon a river due to the
self-perceived shame of the young mother at the out-of-wedlock pregnancy
which has thusly occurred.

Yet how does this pertain to Lord Indra ? Well, read on …

Now before we proceed further, I should note that we shall \*not\* be
going into significant depth about these various figures just
aforementioned. Interested parties are directed to my earlier work:
‘Perseus , Krishna , Karna – Three Perspectives Upon The Origin Myth Of
The Indo-European Striker/Thunderer’.

With that out of the way … the relevant lines of RV IV 18, Griffith
translation:

“5 Deeming him a reproach, his mother hid him, Indra, endowed with all
heroic valour.Then up he sprang himself, assumed his vesture, and
filled, as soon as born, the earth and heaven.  
6 With lively motion onward flow these waters, the Holy Ones, shouting,
as ’twere, together.  
Ask them to. tell thee what the floods are saying, what girdling rock
the waters burst asunder.  
7 Are they addressing him with words of welcome? Will the floods take on
them the shame of Indra?  
With his great thunderbolt my Son hath slaughtered Vṛtra, and set these
rivers free to wander.  
8 I cast thee from me, mine,—thy youthful mother: thee, mine own
offspring, Kusava hath swallowed.  
To him, mine infant, were the waters gracious. Indra, my Son, rose up in
conquering vigour.  
9 Thou art mine own, O Maghavan, whom Vyaṁsa struck to the ground and
smote thy jaws in pieces.  
But, smitten through, the mastery thou wonnest, and with thy bolt the
Dāsa’s head thou crushedst.  
10 The Heifer hath brought forth the Strong, the Mighty, the
unconquerable Bull, the furious Indra.  
The Mother left her unlicked Calf to wander, seeking himself, the path
that he would follow.”

The Jamison-Brereton translation may make things somewhat clearer –
although I am not entirely sure, some of the time, how they have chosen
to assign some of the ‘speakers’ for various verses elsewhere:

“5. \[Narrator:\] Thinking him somehow a disgrace, his mother
concealedIndra, who overflowed with heroic strength.  
But he stood up on his own, clothing himself in a cloak. He filled the  
two world-halves as he was being born.  
6. \[Indra:\] These (waters) flow, babbling, like truthful women
together  
shouting their witness.  
Ask them! What is this they are saying? What rock, what barrier are
the  
waters battering?  
7. \[Indra’s Mother:\] What did they say as invitations to him? Do the
waters  
intend to take on Indra’s disgrace?  
It was my son who set loose these rivers, after having smashed Vr̥tra
with  
his great murderous weapon.  
8. \[Various voices of the waters:\] It was not because of me that the
young  
woman cast you aside. It was not because of me that Kuṣavā (Evil  
Birth) swallowed you.  
But it was certainly because of me that the waters would show mercy  
to the child. It was certainly because of me that Indra stood up with  
his might.  
9. \[Indra’s Mother:\] It was not because of me that the cobra, having  
pierced you down, smashed apart his jaws (to swallow) you, o  
bounteous one.  
Then, (though) pierced down, having gotten the upper hand, you utterly  
crushed the head of the Dāsa with your murderous weapon.  
10. \[Narrator:\] The heifer gave birth to the sturdy, powerfully
charging,  
unassailable bull, the brawny Indra.  
The unlicked calf—his mother impelled him to wander, seeking by  
himself a way for himself”

Now, straightaway we have the clear elements of the typology.

The Mother of Indra is forced to set the infant Indra out upon the
waters due to some perceived ‘disgrace’ which has been incurred by Her.

This Mother, entirely unsurprisingly, is referred to as a Cow – logical
because, of course, the Son is a Bull (as was and is the Father).

The Son is set to ‘wandering’ following the circumstances of His Birth
and Exile – in a similar manner to particular great heroes of myth
aforementioned.

Before eventually, as the result of a combat against a Demon-Dragon to
be found proximate to said Waters , finding the means to engage in a
successful Homecoming.

Now, of course, various details of this fundamental account are altered
in various presentations subsequent thereto.

For example, Herakles is indeed exposed by His Mother, Alcmene … but not
set out upon the Waters. The situation \*may\* be dimly recalled in the
name of Herakles’ stepfather, Amphitryon, although more usually his name
is understood to mean something not notably compatible with notions of
“amphibious”, even though the same root is involved. Karna does not,
unless I am incompletely informed, have a duel with a demon-dragon of
the waters (although \*does\* wield a particular arrow which has
serpentine power). Other derivations and incomplete renditions no doubt
abound.

But that is the nature of a core myth which has evidently been repeated
and re-loka-lized so very often over the preceding five or six millennia
or so. It is, of course, going to have had some elements emphasized or
de-emphasized down across the ensuing span of time and space. Hence why
we must make use of so many tellings, across so many individual
Indo-European spheres, in order to approximately triangulate what the
more original, archaic forms of these narratives ought surely to have
resembled more closely.

The utility of this approach is that, with a primary Vedic expression of
this element to the myth in question identified, my earlier suppositions
around Perseus, Karna, and Krishna representing ‘expressions’ of the
Indo-European Striker/Thunderer deific are therefore rendered more
plausible as the inexorable result.

This is not to discount the value of the later renditions of this myth,
of course – they have validity and viability, too, as far more than
‘mere literature’. We might also postulate that various of the
differences were quite intentional – placed there, and \*kept\* there,
between different versions of the myth for ritual or other understanding
purpose. It would certainly not do to attempt to ‘collapse’ the entire
spanning sphere of Indo-European diversity down to a single figure or
figures as the result of such probing!

Yet nevertheless – the mutually interrelating, mutually supporting
character of these narratives helps us significantly when it comes to
understanding otherwise obscure elements (like RV IV 18 5-8, etc.) which
have previously caused significant difficulty for researchers.

It would be tempting to attempt to read this development in light of
other elements we know about the Story of Indra – whether the ‘disgrace’
mentioned, the ‘Shame of Indra’, is the same as the Brahmahatya sin
incurred as the result of the slaying of Trisiras, for example; thus
situating this ‘birth’ as actually more of a ‘re-birth’ from the stalk
of a reed in the similar manner as the Armenian version of the telling.

But for now, it is enough.
