title = "trika’s parA-devI in saundaryalaharI"

+++
R had asked me if trika’s devI is encoded in the saundaryalaharI. Just
as how the kubjikA-mata’s yAmala is encoded in the SL, likewise the
anuttara lineage’s trikA devI is also encoded in the saundaryalaharI.
The verse is SL15  
sharaj-jyotsnA shubhrAM shashi-yuta jaTA-jUTa makuTAM  
vara-trAsa-trANa sphaTika-guTikA pustakakarAm |  
sakR^in-natvA natvA katham-iva satAM sannidadhate  
madhu-kShIra-drAkShA-madhurima-dhurINAH phaNitayaH ||  
In our tradition we take the reading guTika (akShamAla) against
lakShmIdhara’s ghaTika or cup/pitcher.

In this form she is linked to the glorious lipi-bhairavI who is the
manifestation of the great mAlinI in the shrI-kula system.  
\[As an aside, the very sight of the akShara-s of lipi-bhairavI are
enough to inspire even the fading mind- is there any doubt that our
co-ethnic AdyanAtha achieved total tattvAvesha with her vidyA\]
