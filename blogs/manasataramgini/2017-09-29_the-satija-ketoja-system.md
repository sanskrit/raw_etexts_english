title = "The Satija-Ketoja system"

+++
Satija and Ketoja discovered an interesting dynamical system in course
of the study of the Schrödinger equation for one electron in a two
dimensional periodic lattice on a uniform magnetic ﬁeld. While this
equation and its variants have several uses in physics, that is not our
concern here. Rather, we shall purely focus on the neglected
mathematical aspects of the Satija-Ketoja system in a form completely
removed from its connections to quantum mechanics. To our knowledge,
some of this has never been explicitly discussed. The Satija-Ketoja map
is two dimensional map with a strikingly simple definition:

![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{1}{x\_n-E+2\\sigma\\cos(2\\pi\\theta\_n)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx_n-E%2B2%5Csigma%5Ccos%282%5Cpi%5Ctheta_n%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=\\dfrac{1}{x_n-E+2\\sigma\\cos(2\\pi\\theta_n)}")

![\\theta\_{n+1}=(\\theta\_n+\\omega) \\mod
1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%28%5Ctheta_n%2B%5Comega%29+%5Cmod+1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_{n+1}=(\\theta_n+\\omega) \\mod 1")

Unless stated otherwise for all the experiments described here we
recursively perform the above mapping for 100,000 iterations. Here, the
parameter
![E](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "E")
stems from the eigenvalue of the underlying Schrödinger equation. It may
be taken as 0 or for the purposes of the experiments shown here as 0.1 –
it is not of much consequence for our purpose. For the first experiment
(Figure 1) we set the parameter
![\\omega=e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%3De&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega=e"), i.e. 2.718281828.
![\\theta\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_n") the angle variable of the map changes by increments of size
![\\omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega"). However, since we are taking modulo 1 of the value, our
![\\theta\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_n") axis is bounded between 0 and 1 and effectively projects
the map on the surface of a cylinder of unit circumference. The
parameter
![\\sigma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sigma") is then made to vary between .1 to 2. We find that as
![\\sigma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sigma") changes the map generates an attractor, whose “core” evolves
from a simple closed curve (on the said cylinder; .1, .25); to a curve
with one break (.5), to one with break and a separate branch (.75), to a
strange attractor at
![\\sigma=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sigma=1"). For
![\\sigma\>1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma%3E1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sigma\>1") attractor becomes a many branched curve with trails of
points (1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2).

In our next experiment (Figure 2) with the S-K system we keep
![\\sigma=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sigma=1") and set
![\\omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega") to the following values:
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") (Golden Ratio),
![\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{2}"),
![\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{3}"),
![\\sqrt\[3\]{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%5B3%5D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt[3]{2}"),
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e"),
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi"),
![\\sqrt{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{10}"),
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{22}{7}"),
![\\tfrac{355}{113}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B355%7D%7B113%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{355}{113}"). The first 7 are irrational while the last two are
rational and the well-known 1st and 3rd convergents of the continuous
fraction expressions for
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi").

Another way of visualizing this attractor is in a
![\\theta\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_n")-independent manner by plotting
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") and
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}") (Figure 3) for the same values of
![\\sigma](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sigma") as above. This reveals the strange attractor structure in a
rectangular hyperbolic framework. This latter framework comes from form
of the definition of
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}") which involves a reciprocal relation with
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n")

We notice that for all irrational values both these representations
define complicated attractors. In the case of the
![x\_n-\\theta\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n-%5Ctheta_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n-\\theta_n") plots they are either of the form of a many branched
curve with point trails or a strange attractor similar to that seen with
![e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "e") in
our first experiment. However, the two rational
![\\omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega") values produce “sparse” attractors of the form of a small
number of attracting points. The closer the rational number is to the
irrational number it approximates the denser is its attractor and the
degree to which it recapitulates the structure of the irrational
attractor (compare
![\\tfrac{22}{7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{22}{7}") to
![\\tfrac{355}{113}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctfrac%7B355%7D%7B113%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\tfrac{355}{113}") and both to
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi")). However, two relatively close irrationals (e.g.
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi") and
![\\sqrt{10}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B10%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{10}")) have no particular similarity in their attractors.

While the modulo operator confines
![\\theta\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta_{n+1}") to a cylinder of unit circumference, the hyperbolic
framework for
![x\_{n+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}") in principle makes it unbounded allowing to take a value
between ![-\\infty
:\\infty](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Cinfty+%3A%5Cinfty&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"-\\infty :\\infty"). In the above plots we used all
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") within the range -4:4. But what is the entire range covered by
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n")? To see that simply we plot all
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") values obtained for each
![\\omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega") in the above experiment (Figure 4).

This plot reveals a striking feature: For irrational
![\\omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega") values
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") can explore a very wide range with rare values that are huge in
magnitude. However, for rational values
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") remains bounded in a relatively small range. For example, using
![\\omega=e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%3De&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\omega=e"), in our next experiment
![92.7\\%](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=92.7%5C%25&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"92.7\\%") fall within the range -4:4. It has a mean of 0.00551 and a
median of 0.0326 but a large standard deviation of 102.38 and can
explore values ranging from -14899.84 to 13963.58. Figure 5 shows part
of this peculiar distribution.

5: the blue curve is the below Cauchy distribution

This distribution is approximately symmetrical about 0 but has a paucity
of values in the range from -0.5 : .5. Instead, it shows two peaks on
either side of that zone of suppression. If we discount that central
zone of suppression it shows an informal fit to a Poisson-Cauchy
distribution (today simply called Cauchy) with a location of 0 and a
scale-factor ![\\gamma \\approx
.6](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cgamma+%5Capprox+.6&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\gamma \\approx .6"). Thus, such a Cauchy distribution would be:

![f(x)=\\dfrac{\\gamma}{\\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\gamma^2+x^2}\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cgamma%7D%7B%5Cpi%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cgamma%5E2%2Bx%5E2%7D%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f(x)=\\dfrac{\\gamma}{\\pi}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\gamma^2+x^2}\\right)")

Indeed, certain properties of our distribution are captured quite well
by this Cauchy distribution. For example, for the above run of the S-K
system we compare probabilities for different values being reached with
Cauchy distribution:  
S-K system                             Cauchy distribution  
![p(|x\_n|\>100)=0.00253](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%7Cx_n%7C%3E100%29%3D0.00253&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p(|x_n|\>100)=0.00253")    
![p(|x|\>100)=0.00381](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%7Cx%7C%3E100%29%3D0.00381&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p(|x|\>100)=0.00381")  
![p(|x\_n|\>500)=0.00058](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%7Cx_n%7C%3E500%29%3D0.00058&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p(|x_n|\>500)=0.00058")    
![p(|x|\>500)=0.000763](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%7Cx%7C%3E500%29%3D0.000763&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p(|x|\>500)=0.000763")  
![p(|x\_n|\>1000)=0.00031](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%7Cx_n%7C%3E1000%29%3D0.00031&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p(|x_n|\>1000)=0.00031")  
![p(|x|\>1000)=0.000381](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28%7Cx%7C%3E1000%29%3D0.000381&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"p(|x|\>1000)=0.000381")

This suggests that the S-K system
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") values appear to have a “pathological” or “fat-tailed”
distribution that violates the central limit theorem.

This resemblance of the Cauchy distribution has a connection to a hidden
fractal structure in the S-K system. For this experiment we continue
with the above run of the S-K system with
![w=e](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3De&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"w=e"). In order unveil the fractal we have to perform the following
Fourier transform. We treat the successive
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") values as a time series. Thus, ![x\_1, x\_2,
x\_3...x\_T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C+x_2%2C+x_3...x_T&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_1, x_2, x_3...x_T") are values happening at time
![t=1,2,3...T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t%3D1%2C2%2C3...T&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"t=1,2,3...T"). We then define a frequency
![k=\\tfrac{1}{12}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B12%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"k=\\tfrac{1}{12}"). Then for Tth
![x\_T](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_T&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_T") we can define the Fourier transform as:

![s(k,T)=\\displaystyle \\sum\_{n=1}^T x\_n
e^{2\\pi.k.n.i}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28k%2CT%29%3D%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5ET+x_n+e%5E%7B2%5Cpi.k.n.i%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"s(k,T)=\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^T x_n e^{2\\pi.k.n.i}"), where
![i=\\sqrt{-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D%5Csqrt%7B-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"i=\\sqrt{-1}")

Thus, for each
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") we get a complex number
![x+iy](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Biy&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x+iy") which can then be plotted to visualize the “walk” of the S-K
system. In figure 6 we successively do it for 169, 625, 2500 and 4900
successive
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") values.

[![satija\_05](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/satija_051.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/satija_051.png)Figure

We observe that each of these numbers of steps captures a different
scale. However, the walk has a qualitatively similar form across all
scales establishing its fractality. We observe that in each case the
walk has a large number of minuscule steps and a small number of huge
saltations that are orders of magnitude larger than the minuscule steps
and dominate the image. This pattern is indeed similar to what Benoit
Mandelbrot defined as Cauchy flights, i.e. random walks where the steps
follow a Cauchy distribution. This pattern is very different from what
one would get from a Gaussian distribution of the steps. In the S-K
system walks, if one discounts the suppression close to 0, the central
events are more common and the infrequent events are extreme like in the
classic Cauchy distribution.

Such distributions are what N.N. Taleb emphasizes in the context of the
behaviors of financial markets. We have been attracted to them as
potential analogical models (and perhaps eventually a real models) for
various biological phenomena: 1) The movement of nucleic acid-binding
proteins on DNA or long RNAs when measured with respect to their
position along the nucleic acid polymer could display such saltations
when they are transferred to distant sites by polymer looping. 2) We
also believe that such saltations might capture evolutionary
explorations of a certain morphospace. The morphological diversification
usually is around certain fixed “types” or central tendencies but there
are rare events, which are more extreme that allow entry into a highly
disparate part of the morphospace. This might give the pattern
biological diversity we observe: many related species with small
differences but a rather large gap between one such cluster and another
such cluster of related species. At the higher level this is the reason
why taxonomic units like phyla of animals or families of plants look
meaningful. 3) Finally, it might capture extreme consequences of certain
rare events such as the origin of certain highly destructive species
like Homo. This last pattern is also an analogy to understand the
consequences of rare but extreme historical events.

For another such unusual distribution one look at [our earlier article
on the Hindu square
root](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/10/21/chaos-in-the-iterative-hindu-square-root-method-of-the-ga%e1%b9%87aka-raja/).
