## RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE)

FRIDAY, *July 5, 1895*.

Until you are ready to change any minute, you can never see the truth;
but you must hold fast and be steady in the search for truth. . . .

Chârvâkas, a very ancient sect in India, were rank materialists. They
have died out now, and most of their books are lost. They claimed that
the soul, being the product of the body and its forces, died with it;
that there was no proof of its further existence. They denied
inferential knowledge accepting only perception by the senses.

\*    \*    \*

Samâdhi is when the Divine and human are in one, or it is "bringing
sameness". . . .

Materialism says, the voice of freedom is a delusion. Idealism says, the
voice that tells of bondage is delusion. Vedanta says, you are free and
not free at the same time — never free on the earthly plane, but ever
free on the spiritual.

Be beyond both freedom and bondage.

We are Shiva, we are immortal knowledge beyond the senses.

Infinite power is back of everyone; pray to Mother, and it will come to
you.

"O Mother, giver of Vâk (eloquence), Thou self-existent, come as the Vak
upon my-lips," (Hindu invocation).

"That Mother whose voice is in the thunder, come Thou in me! Kali, Thou
time eternal, Thou force irresistible, Shakti, Power!"
