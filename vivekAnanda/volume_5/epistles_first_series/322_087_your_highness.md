## LXXXVII

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH DIST.,  
*November* (?)*, 1898*.

YOUR HIGHNESS, (Maharaja of Khetri.)

Very glad to learn that you and the Kumar are enjoying good health As
for me, my heart has become very weak. Change, I do not think, will do
me any good, as for the last 14 years I do not remember to have stopped
at one place for 3 months at a stretch. On the other hand if by some
chance I can live for months in one place, I hope it will do me good. I
do not mind this. However, I feel that my work in this life is done.
Through good and evil, pain and pleasure, my life-boat has been dragged
on. The one great lesson I was taught is that life is misery, nothing
but misery. Mother knows what is best. Each one of us is in the hands of
Karma; it works itself out — and no nay. There is only one element in
life which is worth having at any cost, and it is love. Love immense and
infinite, broad as the sky and deep as the ocean — this is the one great
gain in life. Blessed is he who gets it.

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
