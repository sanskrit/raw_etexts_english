<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Noble man</p>
<p class="Text">A richman got a temple constructed. He appointed a priest to worship in the temple. To meet the expenses of the temple transferred in the name of the tample much of land, fields and gardens. He made such an arrangement that if any hungry, poor, afflicted or Sadhus and saints happen to come there, they may stay there four to five days and the remaining of the Lord’s oblation may be provided to them as food from the temple. Now, he needed such a man who might manage the property of the temple and may look after the working of the temple smoothly.</p>
<p class="Text">A number of persons came to that rich man. They were well acquainted that if they got the work of the temple-management, they would get a handsome salary. But the rich person turned all of them back. He said to all who came—‘I want a noble man, I will select him in my own way.’</p>
<p class="Text">Most of the people began to abuse that rich man in their ownself, Some of them called him mad. But the rich person did not pay attention to anyone’s comment. When the curtain of the temple was removed and the door opened, the people started coming for the sight of the Lord; in that duration, the rich man sitting on the roof of his house used to mark the visitors coming to the temple silently.</p>
<p class="Text">One day a man came to the temple for the sight of the Lord. His clothes were filthy and tattered. He did not look even well educated by appearance. When he began to go back after taking the view of the Lord, the rich man called that person near him and said—‘Will you agree to have the control of the management of this temple?’</p>
<p class="Text">That man was astonished. He said—‘I am not so much educated. How will I be able to manage the control of such a big temple?’</p>
<p class="Text">The rich man said—‘I don’t want a very learned person. I want to appoint a noble man as the manager of this temple.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then man said—‘Why did you consider me only as noble man out of so many persons?’</p>
<p class="Text">The rich man said—‘I know that you are a noble man. On the pathway of the temple a piece of brick had been left dug in the ground and one of its corner was pointed upward the ground. I was marking it for several days that by the point of that piece of brick people collided against. People fell down, stumbled and rising up went away. You did not stumble against that piece of brick; but you tried to root it out only to see it. I was watching that you took away spade demanding it from my labourer, You dug it out and made the land there as plain surface also.’ The man said—‘It does not count much. It is the duty of everyone to remove away the pebble, bricks, thorns of the path that may cause a man to collide against.’</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="02.jpg" class="frame-1" src="image/02_fmt.png"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text"> The rich man said—‘Those, who know their duty and fulfil it are called noble men.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">That man became the manager of the temple.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">The true wood-cutter</p>
<p class="Text">Mangal was extremely simple and truthful. He was very poor. He cut the wood in the forest throughout the day and in the evening he went to the market with the bundle of the wood he had cut the whole day. Whatever the money he got by selling the wood for which having purchased flour, salt etc., he returned home. He was fully contented with the earning of his labour. One day, Mangal went to the forest to cut the wood. He climbed on a tree on the bank of a river to cut the dry branch of the tree. While cutting the tree his axe became loose and came out of the wood and fell down into the river. Mangal came down from the tree. He took a dip several times in the river; but he did not find his axe. Mangal sat down on the bank of the river holding his head with his both hands. Tears began to flow from his eyes. He had no money to buy another axe. How he would pull on himself and his family without the axe was a great worry of his mind. This worry was making him restless.</p>
<p class="Text">The forest God took pity on him. He appeared in the disguised form of a child and said—‘Brother! Why are you weeping?’<span class="char-style-override-2"></span></p>
<p class="Text">Mangal saluted him and said—‘My axe fell down into the river. How will I, now, cut the wood and how will I feed my children?’</p>
<p class="Text">The god said—‘Don’t weep! Just I take out your axe from the river!</p>
<p class="Text">The god took a dip into the water and came out with golden axe. He said—‘Take this your axe.’</p>
<p class="Text">Raising his head Mangal saw and said—‘This axe is of any big man. I am a poor man. Wherefrom will I get gold to make the axe? This is the golden axe.’</p>
<p class="Text">The god took another dip the second time and taking out the silver axe he began to give it to Mangal. Mangal said—‘Maharaj! I am unlucky. You took great trouble for me; but my axe could not be found out. My axe is of an ordinary steel.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having taken a dip the third time the God took out the iron axe of Mangal. He thanked the God and took up his axe. The god was pleased with the truthfulness and honesty of Mangal. He said—‘I am pleased with your truthfulness. Take away these both hatchets also.’</p>
<p class="Text">Mangal became rich to get the two axes of gold and silver. Now, he stopped going to the forest to cut the wood. His neighbourer, Ghurahu asked Mangal—‘Why don’t you go, now to cut the wood?’ Mangal was a simpleton, told him everything clearly. The greedy Ghurahu went to the same forest with his axe in the greed of the golden and silver axe. He began to cut the wood of the same tree. Knowingly he dropped his axe into the river and coming down beneath the tree he began to weep.</p>
<p class="Text">The forest-god again appeared to punish Ghurahu for his greed. Having asked Ghurahu and after taking a dip into the river he took out the golden axe. Just to see the golden axe Ghurahu came to shout—This is my axe! </p>
<p class="Text">The forest-God said—‘You tell a lie, this is not your axe! The God threw out that axe into the water and he disappeared. Due to greed Ghurahu lost his own axe also. Weeping and repenting he returned home.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">The greedy King</p>
<p class="Text">In Europe, there is a country named Yunan. In the ancient time in Yunan there ruled a king, named Midas. The king Midas was very greedy. Nothing of the world was dear to him except his daughter and it was gold only dearest to him. Even in his sleep he used to dream of amassing the gold.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the king Midas was counting the gold coins and bricks of gold sitting in his treasury. Suddenly any divine messenger came there. He said to the king—‘Midas! You are very rich.’</p>
<p class="Text">Midas answered with faded face—‘How am I rich? I have nothing but only this much gold.’ The divine messenger said—‘Are you not contented even with so much gold? How much gold do you want?’</p>
<p class="Text">The king said—‘I want that the object I touch should turn to gold.’</p>
<p class="Text">The divine messenger laughed and said—‘All right! Tomorrow in the morning whatever the object you touch will turn to gold.’</p>
<p class="Text">That day, in the night the king Midas could not sleep. The next day, early in the morning he got up. He put his hand on a chair, that turned to gold. He touched a table, that also turned to gold. The king Midas began to spring and dance in joy, Like a mad, running away he went to his garden and began to touch the trees. He touched flowers, leaves, branches and earthen flower pots. All turned to gold. All began to glitter. Midas had no bound of gold in his possession.</p>
<p class="Text">Midas was tired by running and jumping. Yet he was unaware of the fact that his garments had become very heavy because of turning to gold. He was thirsty and hungry also. Coming back from the garden he sat on a chair of gold. A servant brought food and water and placed it before him. But just the moment, Midas touched his meal, the whole meat turned to gold. He took up the glass to drink water, and the water turned to gold. Before Midas the rice of gold, the breads of gold, the potatoes of gold etc., were placed and he was hungry and thirsty. By chewing the gold he could not appease his hunger.</p>
<p class="Text">Midas burst into tears. At the same moment his daughter came there playing. To see her father weeping climbing in the lap of her father she began to wipe away his tears. Midas clasped his daughter to his bosom. But his daughter was no where there. In the lap of Midas his daughter’s idol of gold was so heavy that he could not even bear it in his lap. The poor Midas began to weep beating his head again and again. Now, the divine messenger felt pity at him. He again appeared. Just to see him Midas fell down on his feet and began to make prayer beseeching—‘Please, take back your boon.’</p>
<p class="Text">The divine messenger asked—‘Midas! don’t you want, now, gold? Tell me whether a glass of water is more important or gold? Whether a loaf of bread is better or gold?’</p>
<p class="Text">Midas said with folded hands—‘I don’t want gold. No work of a man is stopped in the absence of gold; but a man cannot live without a piece of bread and a glass of water. Now, I will not run after gold in greed.’</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="04.jpg" class="frame-1" src="image/04_fmt.png"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The divine messenger gave him a bowl of water and said—‘Spray it on every object.’ Midas sprayed that water on his daughter, on the table, chair, meal, water and the trees of the garden. All the objects changed in their original form as they were earlier.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Don’t Do any Work without Consideration</p>
<p class="Text">A farmer had reared a mongoose. The mongoose was very clever and faithful to his master. One day, the farmer had gone somewhere. The farmer’s wife had made her son asleep after suckling him and leaving the mongoose there she went away to the well to fetch water with rope and pitcher.</p>
<p class="Text">After the departure of the farmer’s wife a black cobra came out of its hole. The child had been laid down on the ground on a sheet of cloth and the snake was coming towards the child. The mongoose saw it and fell upon the serpent. He cut the snake into pieces and went at the gate to watch the arrival of the farmer’s wife.</p>
<p class="Text">The farmer’s wife returned with the pitcher full of water. To see the mouth of the mongoose smeared with blood she thought that the mongoose had cut down her child. On account of shock and anger she threw down the pitcher on the mongoose. The poor mongoose died due to being crushed.<span class="char-style-override-3"></span></p>
<p class="Text">That woman ran into the house. She saw that her child was enjoying a sound sleep and a black serpent was lying cut into pieces. The woman came to realise her mistake. She again ran back to the mongoose and taking the dead mongoose up in her lap she began to weep. Now, what was the benefit of her weeping? That is why it has been said—</p>

<p class="Text">‘Anyone who does anything without the prior thinking, repents later on. First of all he causes his own loss and he becomes ridiculous in the world.’</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">The fruit of mercy</p>
<p class="Text">The Emperor Subuktgeen was very poor in the beginning. He was a common soldier. One day, he had gone to the forest for hunting with his gun riding on the horse. That day, he had to make a long race and face a great harassment. After going far away a deer with her younger was seen to him. Subuktgeen sped up his horse after her.</p>
<p class="Text">On account of fear the she-deer hid herself in a bush running away there; but the small youngone of the deer was left behind. Subuktgeen caught the youngone of the deer and having tied its legs he loaded it on the horse back. Even after a long search when he did not find that she-deer, he returned with her youngone.<span class="char-style-override-2"></span></p>
<p class="Text">The she-deer saw that the hunter was taking away the youngone of the she-deer having got it tied. In the attachment of her youngone she came out of the bush and began to run after very fast behind Subuktgeen’s horse. After covering a long distance Subuktgeen saw behind. He was astonished to see the she-deer running after him and he took pity at her. Having untied the legs of her youngone he got it down the horse. The she-deer ran away being very happy with her youngone.<span class="char-style-override-3"></span></p>
<p class="Text">That day, coming back home when Subuktgeen went to asleep he saw a dream in the night. Any divine messenger was saying to him—‘Subuktgeen! Being pleased with your kindness shown to the poor she-deer the Almighty God has enlisted your name in the list of the Emperors. You will become Emperor one day.’</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="06.jpg" class="frame-3" src="image/06_fmt.png"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Subuktgeen’s dream proved to be true. He became an Emperor later on. It was the fruit of his mercy shown to the she-deer. The Lord is sure to be pleased with him who shows mercy to the living beings.<span class="char-style-override-2"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Father and son</p>
<p class="Text">A young father was sitting having his son in his lap. A crow coming flying from somewhere sat on the tiled roof of his house before his eyes. The son asked his father—‘What is this?’</p>
<p class="Text">Father—‘A crow it is’.</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="07.jpg" class="frame-2" src="image/07_fmt.jpeg"/></span> </p>

<p class="Text">The son asked again and again ‘What is this?’</p>
<p class="Text">The father answered again and again ‘This is a crow’.</p>
<p class="Text">In the due course of time the son grew up and the father became old. One day, the father was sitting on a mat. Somebody came to meet his son. The father asked—‘Who has come?’</p>
<p class="Text">The son told him his name. After some time some other one came and the father again asked—This time being irritated the son said—‘Why don’t you remain lying silently? You have nothing to do. Who came? Who went away? Why do you remain jabbering throughout the day?’<span class="char-style-override-2"></span></p>
<p class="Text">The father took a long breath. He held his head with his hands. In a very lamenting tone he began to say slowly and slowly—‘Now, you loose your temper when I ask you only once and you asked me hundred times the same—‘What is this?’ I never chid you. I told you times without number—‘This is a crow’. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Such boys disgracing their parents are considered to be very bad. Always keep it in Your mind—‘How much the mother and father have suffered in bringing you up and what a great affection have they given to you?’<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">Datadeen used to relate stories daily in the evening before going to bed. One day, he said to Gopal—‘Son! never forget one thing that God is omnipresent.’</p>
<p class="Text">Looking here and there Gopal asked—‘Father! God is omnipresent but He is not visible to me anywhere.’</p>
<p class="Text">Datadeen said—‘We cannot see the God; but He is All-pervading and He remains watchful to our every action.’</p>
<p class="Text">Gopal learnt the words of his father by heart. After some days famine broke out. Nothing was produced in the fields of Datadeen. One day, he went out of the village with his son in the dead darkness of the night. He wanted to bring home a bundle of grain crop by stealing it from the field of other one. Asking Gopal to remain on the border of the field he said—‘Remain watching all around, if any one comes towards here or see it, you should inform it to me.’</p>
<p class="Text">As soon as Datadeen sat in the field to reap the grain-crop, Gopal said—‘Father! Stop! Datadeen asked—‘Why; is there anyone watching me?’</p>
<p class="Text">Gopal—‘Yes, someone is watching’.</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="08.jpg" class="frame-2" src="image/08_fmt.jpeg"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">Datadeen came out of the field on the border. He looked all around. When none was visible there, he asked his son—‘Where? Who watches?’</p>
<p class="Text">Gopal—‘It is you who had told me that God is All-pervading and watches everyone’s action. Will He not see you reaping the field?’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Datadeen was ashamed to hear his son’s words. Giving up the idea of stealing, he came back home.’<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Friend’s advice</p>
<p class="Text">No doubt, Durgadas was a rich farmer; but he was very lazy. Neither he went to watch his field nor thrashing floor. He had no idea of his cows and female buffaloes and neither he cared for the household objects of his house. He left every thing on his servants. The domestic arrangement of his house became worse due to his laziness and mismanagement. He began to suffer loss from his farming. He had no sufficient earning even from his milk and butter.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the friend of Durgadas, Harishchand came to his house. Harishchand marked the domestic condition of Durgadas’s family. He understood that the lazy Durgadas would not give up his nature by persuation. So, He said to Durgadas to do his good—‘Friend! I am feeling very much tortured to see your miserable condition. I know a very simple and easy way to remove your poverty.’</p>
<p class="Text">Durgadas—‘Please, tell me that means. I will follow it certainly.’</p>
<p class="Text">Harishchand—‘A white swan residing on the ‘Mansarowar’ comes on the earth before the birds open their eyes in the morning. He returns back two hours after the sun-rise. It is not known when and where he will come; but he who gets its view does not suffer from any lack at all?</p>
<p class="Text">Durgadas—‘Whatever it may be but I will at any cost view his sight.’</p>
<p class="Text">Harishchand went away. Durgadas got very early in the morning. He went out of the house and went the thrashing floor in search of the swan.There he saw that a man was picking up the wheat of his heap to mix it in his wheat-heap. He felt ashamed to see Durgadas and began to beg his pardon.</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="010.jpg" class="frame-1" src="image/010_fmt.png"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">He came back home from the thrashing floor and went to the cow-shade. The watchman there was pouring down the milk having milked his cow into the jug of his wife. Durgadas rebuked him. After breakfast at home he again went out of the house in search of the swan and went to his field. He saw that the labourers had yet not come to his field. He stopped there. When the labourers came late he made its complain to them for coming late. Thus, wherever he went he found his loss was checked.</p>
<p class="Text">In search of the white swan Durgadas began to get up early in the morning daily and began to move. Now, his servants began to work properly. The committance of theft at his place stopped. Previously he used to remain unhealthy, now his health also improved. The field from which he got ten maunds of grain, now he began to get twenty five maunds from the same field. From the cow-shade abundance of milk began to be available to him. </p>
<p class="Text">One day, again Harishchand, the friend of Durgadas came to his house. Durgadas said—‘Friend! The white swan could not be visible to me till now; but remaining engaged in its search proved very profitable to me.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Harishchand laughed and said—‘To do labour is the white swan. The feathers of labour are always white. Those, who depend on their servants instead of doing the labour themselves suffer from loss and he who, himself, does labour and who himself manages the supervision of his servants, enjoys property and honour.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">The vision of Heaven</p>
<p class="Text">Lakshminarayan was a very simpleton boy. He asked his grand mother to relate story daily before going to bed. The grandmother used to narrate him the tales of the abode of serpent demons in one of the regions below the earth, nether world, the world of demigods, the world of moon, the sun-world etc. One day the grandmother related him the description of the heaven in such a beautiful way that Lakshminarayan became obstinate to see the heaven.</p>
<p class="Text">The grandmother persuaded him excessively that living being can not see the heaven; but Lakshminarayan began to weep. In the course of weeping he went to asleep. In the dream he saw that the lustrous gods standing besides him are saying—‘Child! To see the heaven you have to pay. You go to see the circus, you purchase the ticket, isn’t it? To see the heaven also you will have to pay the money similarly.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the course of dream even Lakshminarayan began to think that he would demand money from his grandmother. But the god said—‘In the heaven your money is not in vogue. Here, the money of good and noble deeds is in vogue. Well, keep this tiny box with you. When you do any noble deed one rupee will automatically come in this box and when you commit any evil deed, one rupee will be vanished from it. When this tiny box is full with the rupees, you will be able to see the heaven.’</p>
<p class="Text">When Lakshminarayan got up from sleep, he saw a tiny box near his pillow in reality. He was very much delighted to get the tiny box. That day, his grand mother gave him one paisa. He went out of the house with the paisa. A diseased beggar began to demand paise of him. Lakshminarayan wanted to run away without giving him the paise, in the meanwhile he saw his teacher coming on the way. His teacher used to praise the generous boys very much. To see him Lakshminarayan gave away the paisa to the beggar. The teacher patted on his back and praised him.</p>
<p class="Text">Having come back home Lakshminarayan opened that tiny box; but it was empty. It shocked Lakshminarayan much. While weeping he slept away. In the dream the same gods were visible to him and they said—‘You had given the paise to get the praise from the teacher. Now,  why do you weep? In the hope of any gain if any noble deed is done, is simply a business, that is not the noble deed at all.’</p>
<p class="Text">The next day, his grand mother gave him the paise of two annas. With those paise he purchased two oranges going to the market. His friend, Motilal was ill. While coming back from the market he went away to his friend’s house to see him. The doctor had visited his house for his treatment. Having given the medicine the doctor said to Motilal’s mother—‘Give him today the juice of orange.’ Motilal’s mother was very poor. She began to weep and said—‘I pull on my life on wages. Due to the illness of the son I could not go on duty for many days. I have not a single paise to buy the orange.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Lakshminarayan gave both the oranges to Motilal’s mother. She began to bless Lakshminarayan. Coming back home when Lakshminarayan opened the tiny box, two rupees were glittering in that box.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, Lakshminarayan was busy in his game. His younger sister came there and began to pick up the toys. Lakshminarayan checked her. When she did not agree, he beat her. The poor girl began to weep. When he opened the tiny box this time, he found that many rupees of his collected rupees had vanished. Now, he repented extremely. He resolved never to do any bad deed in future.</p>
<p class="Text">The nature of a man is shaped according to his action. He who commits wrong, his nature becomes bad. Then, he gets joy in doing evil deed. He who does noble deeds, his nature is transformed virtuous. He feels ill to do any evil deed. Lakshminarayan did noble deeds first in greed of rupees. By and by it became his nature to do noble deeds. By doing noble deeds his tiny box was filled with rupees. He was delighted in the hope to see the heaven, he reached his garden with that tiny box.</p>
<p class="Text">Lakshminarayan saw that an old hermit was weeping sitting in the garden. He went to the hermit running and said—‘Baba! Why are you weeping?’</p>
<p class="Text">The hermit said—‘Son! Like the same tiny box what is in your hand, was with me. After the labour of several days I had made that tiny box full of rupees. I was very hopeful to see the heaven with those rupees; but today while bathing in the Gangaji, that tiny box fell down into the river.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lakshminarayan said—‘Baba! Don’t weep my tiny box is also full, take it.’ The hermit said—‘You made it full with hard labour, you will feel grief in giving it away to me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Lakshminarayan said—‘I will not at all be sorry. I am still a boy. I don’t know how long I will have to live alive. I can collect so many tiny boxes full of rupees. You have grown up old. It is in the womb of future whether you will be able to fill the next tiny box or not. So, take my tiny box.’</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="09.jpg" class="frame-1" src="image/09_fmt.png"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">Taking the tiny box the hermit touched his hand on the eyes of Lakshminarayan. Lakshminarayan’s eyes closed. The heaven began to be visible to him—Such a beautiful heaven that his grand mother’s description was not the right description of even one corner of the real heaven.</p>
<p class="Text">When Lakshminarayan opened his eyes, in place of that hermit the same god, seen in his dream was standing before him in apparent form. The god said—‘Son! The heaven becomes the abode of those who do noble deeds. If you continue doing the noble deeds in the same way as you have been doing, you will reach the heaven one day.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">Having uttered so the god disappeared.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">The Greatest Virtuous Soul</p>
<p class="Text">Kashi is famous since ancient time. That is the old centre of Sanskrit-learning. That is famous by the name of the city of ‘Vishvanathji’ or ‘Vishvapuri’. There is a very ancient temple of ‘Vishvanathji’. One day; the priest of Vishvanathji saw a dream that the Lord Vishvanath was asking him to call a meeting of the learned persons and righteous souls in the temple. Just the next day, in the morning the priest got it announced in the whole city. </p>
<p class="Text">All the scholars of Kashi, the Sadhu, saints and other religious souls and charity-donators also came there in the temple after taking bath in the Ganga. All offered water to Vishvanathji, went round the deity clockwise and stood in the assembly-hall or outside. There was a great rush of the people in the temple that day. When the assembly became full of the visitors the priest of the temple put up his dream before all. All began to pray ‘Shankarji’ making the loudation of ‘Har Har Mahadeo’.</p>
<p class="Text">When the ceremonial adoration of the Lord of waving light was finished; the sound of drum and bells stopped and all had finished their prayer, everyone saw a sudden bright illumination in the temple. A gold-leaf was lying there near the idol of the Lord Vishvanathji, which was inset with costly gems and diamonds. The glittering of the gems was illuminating the temple. The Priest picked that gold-leaf in which was written in the letters of diamond—‘This is the gift of Vishvanathji to the foremost kind man  and virtuous soul.’</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="011.jpg" class="frame-4" src="image/011_fmt.jpeg"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">The Priest was of great sacrificing nature and a true God-devotee. He showed this gold-leaf to all of them. He said—‘On every monday, the meeting of the learned persons will be held here. This gold-leaf will be awarded to him who succeeds in proving himself the foremost virtuous soul and the best merciful person’.</p>
<p class="Text">This news spread all around the country. From far and wide the devotees of hard penance, relinquishers, observes of fast, charity-donators began to reach there. A Brahman had observed ‘Chandrayanvrat’ for a number of months. He came there to get that gold-leaf. But when that gold-leaf was awarded to him, it turned to soil just when it reached in his hands, its glitter vanished. Being ashamed of he returned back that gold-leaf. But just as it reached the hands of the priest, it again changed into gold and the gems and diamonds began to glitter.</p>
<p class="Text">A Babuji had got constructed many schools and ran several voluntary service homes. By the practice of his charity donations he had spent almost his entire wealth. He always donated to many institutions. His name was published in the newspapers. He also came to take that gold-leaf but it turned to earth even reaching in his hands also. The priest said to him—‘You seem to be donator in the interest of your own status, dignity, repute etc. The donation made in the interest of name and fame is not the true charity donation.’</p>
<p class="Text">Similarly a number of persons came but none could get the gold-leaf. It turned into the earth just reaching in the hands of others. A number of months passed. Most of the people began to perform the act of charity and nobility just near the temple of the Lord Vishwanathji in the greed of getting that gold-leaf. But even they could not get that gold-leaf.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, an old farmer came for the venerable sight of the Lord Vishwanathji. He was a rural peasant. His clothes were dirty and tattered. He had come only for the sight of the Lord. He had some flour of parched grain tied in his clothes and a tattered blanket. Near the temple the people were distributing the clothes and puri-sweet among the poor people; but a leper was groaning lying at a distance from the temple. He was unable to even rise up. His whole body was wounded. He was hungry, but nobody paid heed to him. The old farmer felt pity at the leper. He gave him his flour of parched grain to eat and wrapped him with his blanket. He came to the temple from there for the view of the image.</p>
<p class="Text">The Priest of the temple had now made this rule to put that gold-leaf in the hand of each and every visitor of the temple who visited on monday. When the old farmer came out of the temple after viewing the sight of Vishvanathji, the priest put the gold-leaf in his hand. Just reaching his hands the gems set in the golden letter began to glitter with double brightness. Everyone began to praise the old farmer. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">The Priest said—‘The Lord Vishwanathji has awarded you this gold-leaf. He is the foremost virtuous soul who is free from greed, who has the sentiment of pity for the destitutes, who donates in charity without any selfish motive and serves the agonised persons.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">A merchant was giving honey to his customer. The pot of the honey slipped from the hands of the merchant suddenly and fell down on the ground. A lot of honey spread away on the ground. The merchant lifted up so much honey as much he could; but some honey remained spread on the ground. </p>
<p class="Text">A good number of bees came and sat on the honey in the greed of the sweetness of the honey. They liked the sweet honey very much. They began to lick the honey hurriedly. They remained busy in licking the honey till they were satisfied fully.</p>
<p class="Text">When the bees were fully satisfied, they wanted to fly but their wings had clinged to the honey. As much they fluttered to fly so much their wings clinged. Their whole body used to be pasted with honey. </p>
<p class="Text">A good number of bees died rolling down in the honey. Some of them were writhing due to their wings clinged to the honey. But the other bees came there in the greed of the honey generally. They did not get themselves free from the greed of licking honey even to see the dead bees and the writhing bees. </p>
<p class="Text">To see the miserable condition and foolishness of the bees the merchant said—‘Those who become infatuated with the taste of the tongue are foolish like these bees. In the greed of a little pleasant taste of the tongue they damage their health, they writh to be the patient of disease and very soon they are taken away by the death.</p>

<p class="Text">Matadin had five sons—Shivram, Shivdas, Shivlal, Shivsahai and Shivpujan. All the five sons used to quarrel mutually. They began to wrangle on the triffling matters and scuffled together.</p>
<p class="Text">Matadin had become very much fed up with the quarrel of his sons. One day, he called them to him with the motive to persuade them. Beforehand he had made a small bundle of five dry thin twigs. He said to his sons—‘Anyone of you who breaks this bundle of these twigs, will get the reward of one rupee.’</p>
<p class="Text">All the five sons began to quarrel to break the bundle first. They were afraid of that if the next brother breaks the bundle first, he will get the reward. Matadin said—‘Let it be broken by the youngest brother Shivpujan first.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Shivpujan lifted up the bundle and began to use his force. He applied his great strength by pressing the teeth and shutting and opening his eyes repeatedly. Sweat appeared on his forehead; but the twigs of the bundle could not be broken. He gave the bundle to Shivsahai. He also used his force but could not break it. Thus, all the sons tested their strength turn by turn; but none of them could succeed in breaking the bundle of the twigs.</p>
<p class="Text">Matadin untied the bundle and gave each one a single twig separately to break. This time everyone broke the twig at once. Now, Matadin said—‘What you saw! So long as these twigs were united, none of you could break it but when they were separated you broke it easily. In the same way, if you remain quarreling together and remain separate, the others will cause you trouble and oppress you but if you remain united, none will dare to oppose you.’</p>

<p class="Text">There lived a farmer in a village. His name was Sher Singh. Sher Singh was dreadful and arrogant like a lion. He used to be vindictive on the triffling matters and came to quarrel. He did not talk to the villagers in an appropriate manner. Neither he visited anyone’s house nor saluted anyone. The other farmers of the village also didn’t talk to him considering him as an arrogant.</p>
<p class="Text">Another farmer, named Dayaram came there and settled in that village. He was very simple and a noble man. He talked to everyone meekly. He used to help everyone by anyway to some extent. All the farmers gave him due respect and used to seek his counsel in their individual affairs.</p>
<p class="Text">The farmers of the village said to Dayaram—‘Brother Dayaram! Never try to visit Sher Singh’s house. Always maintain distance from him. He is very quarrelsome.’</p>
<p class="Text">Smiling Dayaram said—‘If Sher Singh happens to quarrel with me, I will kill him.”</p>
<p class="Text">The other farmers also burst to laughter. They knew that Dayaram was very kind. To kill anyone was a far fetched affair he could not even abuse anyone. But somebody conveyed this news to Sher Singh. Sher Singh grew red in anger. Since that very day he began to try to find out any cause to quarrel with Dayaram. He set his bullock free in the field of Dayaram. The bullock grazed more than enough portion of his field; but Dayaram simply drove away the bullock from his field silently. </p>
<p class="Text">Sher Singh broke out the drain of water going into the field of Dayaram. The water began to overflow. Dayaram came and repaired the drain silently. In the same way Sher Singh always remained causing harm to Dayaram but Dayaram didn’t allow him any opportunity to quarrel.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, any relative of Dayaram sent very sweet musk melon to him from Lucknow. Dayaram sent one musk melon to each and every farmer’s house; but Sher Singh didn’t accept his musk melon saying that—‘I am not a street-beggar; I don’t accept the charity donation of anyone. </p>
<p class="Text">The rainy season set in. Sher Singh was coming from an other village with a bullock-cart full of grain. His cart got entangled into the mud of drain. Sher Singh’s bullocks were weak. They could not pull out the cart from the mud. When this news spread in the village, all the villagers said—‘Sher Singh is very wicked. Let him remain in the drain throughout the night.’</p>
<p class="Text">But Dayaram set out towards the drain with his strong bullocks. The other villagers checked him and said—‘Dayaram! Sher Singh has caused you great harm. You used to say that if he quarreled with you, you would kill him. Then, why do you go to help him?’</p>
<p class="Text">Dayaram said—‘Really, I will kill him today. You will watch him tomorrow in the morning.’</p>
<p class="Text">When Sher Singh saw Dayaram coming with his bullocks he said in vanity—‘Go back with your bullocks. I don’t want anyone’s support.’</p>
<p class="Text">Dayaram said—‘If you want you may abuse me or beat me, at present you are in trouble. Your cart is entrapped and the night is about to set in. I cannot agree to you at present.</p>

If someone is saying something and without listening to him if anyone starts speaking, he will also be called a foolish. Anyone who abuses someone without any fault or without any shortcoming or demerit and blames him is also a great fool.

<p class="Text">There lived a rich man in a village. His name was Bhairomal. Bhairomal was a big landlord. He had appointed many servants and labourers. Bhairomal was very lazy and slow. He never went to watch his fields. He used to get his work done through his servants.</p>
<p class="Text">The servants and labourers did their duty very carelessly. They did the work on the field a little and they passed their rest time at their homes; either they wandered about or passed the time in gossip. The fields were neither  ploughed nor watered properly and nor fertilizers were given to the crops properly. Even the sufficient seeds were not sowed upto the mark and the useless and unwanted grass was never rooted out. It resulted that the production began to decrease gradually. After some time Bhairomal began to be poor.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same village there was another farmer, named Ram Prasad. He had no field. He did farming in some of the fields taken from Bhairomal; but no doubt, he was very laborious. He went to the field himself with the labourers. His fields were ploughed and watered properly. Sufficient fertilizer was given to the crops. The unwanted grass was rooted out and the fields were sowed also timely. His family members also worked in the field. There was a good production in his fields. Even after paying off revenue tax and other expenses he used to save sufficient grain. After some time Ram Prasad became rich. </p>
<p class="Text">Now, Bhairomal became very poor, when he fell into the debt of heavy loan of the money-lenders he felt need to sell his fields. Getting this news Ram Prasad came to his house and said—‘I have heard that you want to sell your fields. Please, sell your fields to me. I will not pay you less value than others.’<span class="char-style-override-3"></span></p>
<p class="Text">Bhairomal asked in astonishment—‘Brother Ram Prasad! I had so much field, yet I am indebted; but how have you earned so much? You made farming in some of my own fields only. You have to pay the revenue of the fields also and pull on your family also. Who gave you money to purchase my field?’ </p>
<p class="Text">Ram Prasad said—‘None gave me money. I have collected the money by selling the production of the land. There is one difference between your farming and my farming. You ask your servants and labourers etc., all. ‘Go-go’ to get your work done, due to this your property also went away. First, being self-prepared before my servants and labourers I call them ‘Come on’ to do the work with me. So the property comes to me.’</p>

Once, in the winter season the fowler went into the forest early in the morning. That day, he didn’t get any bird. Moving about from one forest to another his whole day passed. He had gone away so far in the forest that he could not return home that day. On the spread of the darkness he sat down under a tree to pass the night. </p>
<p class="Text">That day, it had rained in the day. It had hailed. It was chilly cold. The cold was at its climax. The fowler had no clothes. The sharp wind began to blow. The fowler began to shiver with cold badly. His teeth began to chatter due to cold.</p>
<p class="Text">A pigeon had his nest in the tree in which he lived with she-pigeon there under which the fowler was sitting. To see the miserable condition of the fowler the pigeon said to his beloved she pigeon—‘Although he is our enemy; but he is our guest here today. It is our moral duty to serve him. Just now, the night has started. The cold will increase more in the night. If he has to pass the night in the same condition he will die of cold. We will be sinner of his death. Let us find out some way to protect him from cold.</p>
<p class="Text">The pigeon and she pigeon dropped their nest on the ground. They brought some more straws also by holding in their beaks and dropped it there. Then, the she pigeon flew away and from a distant place she brought a piece of burning wood in her beak. She dropped that burning wood on the heap of the straw. The straws began to burn. Collecting more woods from round about the fowler dropped them also in the fire. His cold was removed.</p>
<p class="Text">The fawler was hungry of the whole day. Now, he began to see round about in the light of the fire so that if he might get anything he might appease his hunger by eating that. His throat was going dry due to hunger. When the she-pigeon saw his such condition she said to the pigeon—‘The guest is apparent next form of the Lord. His all the noble deeds are destroyed from whose house the guest goes away hungry. This fowler is our guest to-day and he is hungry. We have nothing to appease his hunger, I just jump into this burning fire so that he may appease his hunger to eat my meat.’ <span class="char-style-override-2"></span></p>
<p class="Text">Having uttered so the she pigeon jumped into the fire from the tree. The pigeon said to himself—‘How will the hunger of the guest be appeased with a little meat of the pigeon? I will also give him my meat jumping into the fire.’ The pigeon also jumped into the fire.</p>

Just when the farmer went away home after sowing seeds and using plank over it in his field, so many bands of birds came to his field and sat there and began to pick out the sowed seeds by scrapping in the field and ate it. The farmer was tired of flying the birds. The birds ate up a lot of his seeds. The poor had to sow the seeds again in the field after ploughing it again.</p>
<p class="Text">This time the farmer brought a large net. He spread the net on the whole field. A number of birds came in the field to pick the grain with the beak and were entrapped into the net. A crane was also entrapped.</p>
<p class="Text">When the farmer began to catch the entrapped birds of the net the crane said—‘Please, be graceful to me. I have not assailed you any harm. I am neither hen nor heron and nor any bird to pick your seed. I am a crane. I eat up the insects that cause loss to the farming. Release me.</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="023.jpg" class="frame-11" src="image/023_fmt.jpeg"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">The farmer was terribly angry. He said—‘What you say may be right but you have been trapped today with the same birds which usually pick my seeds. You are also with them. You are also their companion. If you have accompanied them you should also suffer with them.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">A man is known by the company he keeps. Those who live with the bad fellows and does not do any wrong even then get the punishment certainly. Due to coming with the harmful birds, the crane was also trapped.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-26">The Lesson of the Crane</p>
<p class="Text">A couple of Crane lived there in a field near a village. Their eggs were also there. The eggs grew and the youngones came out of them timely. But till the youngones could grow up worth flying the crops of the field was ripe. The Cranes were much worried. Before the farmer comes to reap his crops they should fly away with their youngones from there but the youngones could not fly. The Crane said to youngones—‘In our absence if any one comes near the field, you will keep his words in your memory listening to it.</p>
<p class="Text">One day when the Crane came to his children in the evening with the fodder the children, said—‘Today, the farmer had come. He remained moving round the field. He gazed at the field standing at some spots of the field. He said—‘Now, the field is worth reaping. Today, I will say to the villagers reaching home that they should get my crops reaped.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Crane said—‘Don’t be afraid of. The field will not be reaped yet very soon. There is delay in getting the field reaped.’</p>
<p class="Text">After many days when the Crane came to his youngones in the evening, the youngones were very much perturbed. They began to say—‘Now, we should not make any delay at all in leaving this field. Today, the farmer had come again. He was saying that the villagers were very selfish. They don’t manage at all to get my crops reaped. Tomorrow, I will get the crops of my field reaped by sending my brothers.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Crane sat near his youngones being carefree and said—‘Yet the field is not to be reaped. You will be able to fly properly within two to four days. There is no need to fear now.’</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="026.jpg" class="frame-4" src="image/026_fmt.jpeg"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">Many days passed. The youngones of the Crane had began to fly now and had become fearless. One day, in the evening they began to say to the Crane—‘This farmer frightens us uselessly. His field will not be reaped. He had come even today and he was saying—‘My brothers don’t listen to me. They make excuses. The grain of my crop is now falling down being dried. Tomorrow early in the morning, I will come and reap the crops.’</p>
<p class="Text">Being disturbed the Crane, said—‘Let us move from here. Make haste. It is not yet dark. Let us fly to somewhere else. The field will be reaped tomorrow certainly.’</p>
<p class="Text">The children said—‘Why? This time the crop will be reaped, how is it so?’</p>
<p class="Text">The Crane said—‘So long as the farmer was dependant on the villagers and his brothers, there was no hope of the crop to be reaped. Anyone who depends on others for his work, does not get his work done. But when he becomes ready to do himself, his work is not detained. When the farmer himself is ready to reap his crop, it is certain that it will be reaped.’<span class="char-style-override-2"></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-27">The Return of Beneficence</p>
<p class="Text">Once, a big and thick thorn pricked into the leg of a lion. The lion tried his best to pull it out but the thorn could not be pulled out. He reached a shepherd walking lamely. The shepherd got frightened very much to see the lion coming towards him. But he knew it well that if he tried to run awy, the lion would catch him only in two leaps. There was no tree also there that the shephard might climb on it. Finding out no other way, the shepherd remained sitting there silently.</p>
<p class="Text">The lion neither roared nor growled. He came before the shepherd and sat down and stretched his leg before the shephard.</p>
<p class="Image"><span><img alt="025.jpg" class="frame-2" src="image/025_fmt.jpeg"/></span> </p>
<p class="Text">The shepherd came to understand that the lion wanted his support. He pulled out the thorn from the lion’s feet. As the lion had come in the same way he went back towards the forest.</p>
<p class="Text">After some day there was a theft at the king’s palace. Some people said to the king falsely due to hostility that the shepherd was the thief. It was he who had committed the theft. The shepherd was arrested. The stolen goods could not be traced out in his house. The king thought that he had hidden the goods of theft somehere. So, he placed an order to throw the shepherd alive before a lion.</p>
<p class="Text">By chance, the same lion from whose feet the shephard had pulled out the thorn was caught to kill him. When the shepherd was left before the lion, the lion recognised him. He came and sat down near the shepherd and began to wag the tail like a dog.</p>
<p class="Text">The king was very much surprised. On query when he came to know the obligation of the lion with the shepherd, he released the shepherd.</p>

He used to frighten everyone. Thus, he enjoyed a very good comfortable life. He used to graze everyone’s field. Everyone got frightened to see him. He said that he was the king of the forest. He had become very fat and plump. He rebuked the beasts of the forest and overawed everyone. One day, it was the moonlit night. It pleased the donkey very much. He went to the field and began to graze. The caretakers ran away being frightened. Any donkey brayed somewhere. He also raised his ears.</p>
<p class="Text">He also began to bray raising his mouth upward. His disguise was disclosed before everyone. The caretakers raised their bamboo-sticks and beat the donkey severely. He who deceives others, gets the same result what the donkey suffered.</p>

He used to take away the edible objects. The householders were not grieved with this, but they were fed up with the disturbances that he created.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the master of the house said—‘Having trapped this monkey, I will send him somewhere outside.’ He got an earthen cooking put of narrow mouth bought and having dropped some parched gram in it he buried it in the ground. Only the mouth of the earthen pot was open. Everyone went away from there.</p>
<p class="Text">The monkey came in the house. He remained springing here and there for sometime. When he saw the gram in the buried earthen pot coming near the earthen pot he sat there. He dropped his hand into the earthen pot to take out the gram and filled the gram in his fist. The mouth of the earthen pot was narrow. His twisted fist could not be pulled out. The monkey began to use his full potency to take out his fists and began to spring. He cried and sprang, but due to greed he did not leave the gram of the fist.</p>

While sharing it equally they quarrelled. One of them was blaming the other one that her piece of bread was bigger and the other one was saying that her piece of bread was not bigger.</p>
<p class="Text">When they failed in the mutually sharing properly, they went to a monkey. They chose the monkey their judge. The monkey got a balance brought and put the both pieces of the bread separately on the separate steel pan of the balance.

<p class="Text">There lived a lion and a tiger in any forest. Commonly, the lion was very strong; but he had grown old. He could not run fast now. The tiger was fat and vigorous. In spite of it the tiger remained afraid of the lion and maintained friendship with him, because despite being old the lion was undoubtedly some stronger than the tiger.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, for many days, the lion and the tiger both didn’t get any prey. The both were very hungry. They saw a small deer grazing close to them. The tiger said to the lion—‘I just catch the deer. You, please sit down on that drain so that the deer may not hide himself running away in the drain.’</p>
<p class="Text">The lion sat down on the drain. The tiger caught the deer running after him and killed him. But the deer was very small. It could appease the hunger of only one of them. The both were hungry. So, the both were tempted. The tiger began to say—‘I alone have killed the deer, so only I will eat.’</p>
<p class="Text">The lion said—‘I am the king of the forest. It is only I to eat the deer. You can run fast, run away to catch another prey.’</p>

<p class="Text">Once, a rabbit was boasting—‘I bounce quite  long bounds. None in the world can run faster than I.’</p>
<p class="Text">There was lying a tortoise. The tortoise said—‘Brother! You run very fast, it is doubtless; but none should be arrogant. Pride brings shame.’</p>
<p class="Text">The rabbit said—‘This is not my false praise. What is wrong to describe the true quality? You creep like an insect, that is why you feel jealous to hear my quality.’</p>

<p class="Text">The tortoise pointed out toward a tree which was situated far away from there and said—‘All right! Let us run to that tree, he who reaches there first will be winner.’</p>
<p class="Text">The rabbit thought that the poor tortoise would creep on slowly and slowly. So, I should start from here when the tortoise has to cover only the distance of four hands to reach the tree, even then, I will bounce bounds and reach there earlier than he. He said to the tortoise—‘You are very slow. You will move slowly and slolwy, start at once. I just come after a while.’</p>

<p class="Text">A very good story is mentioned in the Puran. There was a tank in a forest. The animals and beasts of that forest used to come to that tank to drink water. One day, a hunter came to the tank. Having washed his hands and mouth in the tank, he drank water there. The hunter was very tired. He thought—‘It is sure that the animals of the forest will come to this tank to drink water. I will get the hunting here very easily.’ He climbed on the wood-apple tree near the tank and sat on it.</p>
<p class="Text">A she-deer came there to drink water in the tank. The hunter stretched his bow and arrow to hunt the she-deer. The she-deer came to see the hunter stretching his bow and arrow. She said—‘Brother hunter! I know that I cannot escape myself now from your arrow, but show mercy to me. My two youngones would be waiting for me on the way. Leave me for a while. I promise of that after milking my youngones and handing over them to my friend, she-deer, I will come back to you.’</p>
<p class="Text">The hunter laughed. He could not believe that the she-deer would come again to him to sacrifice her life. But he thought—‘When she assures in such a way, she should be left. If my luck favours I will get another hunting.’ He let the she-deer go away.</p>
<p class="Text">After sometime, a black beautiful deer of long horns came there to drink water. When the hunter stretched his bow and arrow to hunt him, the deer happened to see him and said—‘Brother hunter! It got too late to meet my she-deer and youngones. They must be feeling disturbed. Let me go there and meet them and console them. I certainly come back to you. At present be kind enough to let me go away.’</p>
<p class="Text">The hunter was very much irritated. He was very hungry. But he let the deer go away so because if his luck did not favour him and compelled him to remain hungry. He would remain hungry that day also.</p>
<p class="Text">The she-deer went to her youngones. She milked her children, fondled them. Then, she narrated the entire event to her friend, she-deer. She wanted to handover her youngones to her. In the meanwhile the deer also reached there. He also loved his youngones. The youngones were not ready to  be separated from their parents. At last, yielding to their obstinacy the deer and she-deer allowed them also their company.</p>
<p class="Text">Reaching the tank the deer said to the hunter—‘Brother hunter! Now we have already come. Now, you can hunt us with your arrow and appease your hunger with our meat.’</p>
<p class="Text">The hunter was very much amazed to see the deer and she-deer. He came down from the tree and said—‘Just mark! How truthful these deers are despite being animals! Being free from the greed and attachment of their lives they have come to me to keep the truth. In spite of being a human being how mean and sinner I am that I kill the innocent animals to appease my hunger and to earn some money. Now, I will never kill any animal.’</p>
