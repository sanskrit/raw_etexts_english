A:So,ekAdashI should not be observed if it is ‘viddha'(mixed with
dashami/similar stuff)?  
B:Difference of opinion between smArtas and vaiShNavas.vaiShNavas look
for shuddha ekAdashI,smArtas do not.  
A:What exactly is there to discount the other sides’ opinion?Say,a
smArta discounting a vaiShNava opinion or vice versa?Basically how would
a smArta view vaiShNava citations or…  
B:The citations contradict,so sampradAya wins. It’s simple. IMO it’s a
difference in focus.  
A:Could you explain?  
B:vaiShNava focus is for pAraNa on dvadashi…Making sure dvAdashi is
there when fast is broken.  
A:smArta focus is on fasting during majority of ekadashi.Neither is
wrong per se…Personally I think thesmArta is more correct on
balance,since focus should be on fast and not breaking it on subsequent
tithi.
