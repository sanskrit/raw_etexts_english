## CLXX

*To Swami Abhedananda*

770 OAK STREET  
SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.  
C/O DR. LOGAN, M.D.  
\[*May 19, 1900?*\]

MY DEAR ABHEDANANDA

I am very, very glad to hear about the new home of the Vedanta Society.
As things stand, I will have to come to New York direct from here —
without stoppage — but it will be two or three weeks yet, I am afraid.
Things are coming up so fast that I can not but change my plans and stop
a few more days.

I am trying my best to get one of you for a flying visit to this Coast —
it is a great country for Vedanta.

Get all my books and clothes etc., in your home. I am coming soon. My
love to Mrs. Crane. Is she still living on beef-steak and hot water?
Miss \[Sarah Ellen\] Waldo and Mrs. Coulston[1](#fn1) write about the
publication of a new edition of *Karma-Yoga*. I have written to Miss
Waldo all about it. The money in hand from the sale of books ought to be
spent, of course.

Do you see my books and clothes all safe there? They were with Mrs. Bull
in Boston.

With all love,  
VIVEKANANDA

1.  [^](#fn1_1)Mrs. Mary B. Coulston was secretary, in 1898, and later
    treasurer, in 1899, while serving on the executive committee of the
    New York Vedanta Society, founded by Swami Vivekananda in 1894. She
    was given the name of Brahmacharini Sevaputa by Swami Abhedananda,
    who, on April 2, 1899, gave her the Brahmacharya vows with five
    others, including Gurudasa (Swami Atulananda).
