§ 1. Chronological Notes.

A necessary complement to a critical study of the Mahabharata is an
intensive study of the commentaries of the Mahabharata, of which there is


[ABORI 17. 185-202).

EPIC STUDIES


quite a large number preserved still, mostly in manuscript form. Among
the scholiasts who have written commentaries on the Mahabharata~~either
on the whole, or only on selected parts of the Great Epic— are : ( 1 ) Ananta-
bhatta, (2) Arjunamisra, (3) Anaiida, (4) Caturbhuja(misra), (5) Jaga-
disacakravartin, (6) Devabodha, (7) Nilakajifha, (8) Mahanandapuroa,
(9) Yajha-Narayapa, (10) Ratnagarbha, (11) Ramakimkara, (12) Rama-
krsua, (13) Ramanuja, (14) Lak^maija, (15) Varada, (16) V^iraja, (17)
Vidyasagara, (18) Vimalabodha, (19) Samkaracarya, (20) Srinivasa, (21),
Sarvajna-Narayaloa, and (22) Sr§tidhara. Very little is at present known
about these commentators : only very few of them have been, so far, pub-
lished. The only collective study made of these commentaries is by Holtz-
MANN in Das Mahdhhdrata, VoL 3, p. 67 ff., and that was in 1897, that
is, nearly forty years ago. The material at his disposal was very scanty,
and so are his notes.

But the study of these commentaries must be now taken up more seri-
ously, not so much for the sake of the explanations contained in the com-
mentaries — though even the glosses of a commentator like Devabodha are
extremely important — ^as for the readings and pafhantaras recorded in them ;
because, most of £186} the commentaries are older — some very much older
—than our manuscripts ; and therefore the documentation of these readings
by the commentators takes us back a stalge further in our investigation of
the history of the epic.

The usefulness of these commentaries is, however, considerably dimini-
shed by the fact that we know next to nothing about these commentators
themselves. In*particular, we lack information about their dates, which are
not easy to fix in Indian literature. Even if the dates cannot be determined,
it would be a great help if we could fix their relative chronology. An at-
tempt is made in the following pages to fix, to start with, the relative
chronology of some of the more important Mahabharata commentators.

A fixed point in the exegetical literature centering round the Mbh. is
furnished by Nilakaptha, who until lately was considered, at least in India,
as the most trustworthy guide for the exposition of the Great Epic, and
about whose date there is not much doubt. The available personal data
about him has been put together by Wilhelm Printz in the biographical note
on Mlakaiptha appended to his Berlin dissertation entitled Bhd^aworter in
Nilakantha's Bhdratabhdvadipa und in anderen Smskriihommentmen.^
Nilakaajtha'. according to his own statements, was a Mahara§>tra Brahmin
of the Gautama Gotra, with the surname Caturdhara (modem Chaudhari),
eldest son of Govinda Suri and Phullambika, residing at Kurparagmma
(modem Kopargaon) on the Godavari. ISRlakantha wrote his commentary

cularly p. 70 f.

on the Mbh. ahd on the Gaoesagjta (a section of the GaBiesapuraoa) in
Benares, in the last quarter of the seventeenth century,^ the latter (Gaioesa-
^tia) being composed in a.d. 1694.®

In the beginning of his commentary on the Mbh. Nllakantha
tells us that before writing his commentary, the Bharaiabhdvadipfi, he had
compared many {bahun) copies of the Mbh., collect-£l87}-ed together from
different parts of India (vibhinnadesydn) in order to ascertain the correct
reading {pat ham agryam) and also consulted older commentaries.'^ We ac-
cordingly find that he frequently mentions variant readings and “ additional ”
passages found in the versions consulted by him, and he cites the explana-
tions given by older scholiasts information, scanty though it be, of im-
mense interest and value for the history of the received text.

(z) Devabodha and Sarvajna-N drdyana.

In marked contrast to Nilakaajtha stands Devabodha, whom I regard
as probably the oldest and therefore the most important commentator of the
Mbh. He is extremely reticent about himself atid his predecessors, but is
cited or mentioned by several commentators, who must therefore have lived
after him. ^ One of such successors of Devabodha was Sarvajha-Narayana.
Sarvajha’s Bhdr atari haprakdsa has fortunately been preserved, though it is
not definitely known whether his commentary on all the eighteen parvans of
the Mbh. is now available. His commentary on the Virata and the Udyoga
has already been published by Mahadeva Shastri Bakre." The Bombay
Government MSS. Collection (No. 180 of 1891-95) contains a fragment of
his commentary on the Adi, comprising merely the first adhyaya with the
beginning of the second ; while the Madras Government Collection (No. 2169)
contains another fragment which lacks the beginning. In the colophon of
the latter MS., Sarvajha is styled paramahamsar-parivrdjakdcdrya ; he was
therefore a sarhnyasin.

Now Sarvajna explicitly refers to Devabodha in the beginning of his
commentary on the Udyoga :

1 He was apparently a protege of Anupasiihha, who was a contemporary of
Shah Jahan.

® The year of composition is given as Sarhvat 1750, The name of the com-
mentary is Gaj^patibhdvadipikd, Cf. the name of his Mbh. commentary, Bharata-
bhdvadlpa ; see next note.

£ 188 } This stanza is curiously enough not found in the commentary
of Sarvajiia as printed in the GujaiatS Press edition of the Udyoga, but
occurs in both the MSS. of the work in the Bombay Government Collection
(deposited at the Institute), bearing Nos. 33 of A 1879-80 and 168 of
1884-87 respectively. The priority of Devabodha is, however, independ-
ently established by another direct reference to Devabodha in the body of
the published commentary itself, to which my attention was recently drawn
by my friend and colleague Professor Sushil Kumar De of Dacca Univer-
sity, who is editing the Udyoga for the Institute. In Sarvajna’s comment
on B|. 5. 96. 41 (on p. 327 of the Gujarati Printing Press edition), we find ;

This quotation can unfortunately not be verified ; for in the very old
Bengal Asiatic Society’s palm-leaf MS. (No. 3399) of the unpublished com-
mentary on the Udyoga by Devabodha the corresponding folio is missing I
But there is no reason to doubt its authenticity.

This establishes Devabodha’s priority to Sarvajna. We therefore get

Series 1 : D 0 v a b o dh a—S ar v a j n a

Now this Sarvajna-Narayaha must be identical — ^as has indeed been
assumed by Jolly,^ Buhler,^ Holtzmann,^ and others-''’— with the Sarvajfia-
Narayaina (also called Narayana-Sarvajfia) the author of the Manvarthavrtti
or Manvarthanibandha, a £189} well-known commentary on the Manusmrti,
published by V. N. Mandlik.® The assumed identity of the two commen-
tators at present rests, it is true, merely on the identity of the names, but
can scarcely be regarded on that account as doubtful. It is hardly conceiv-
able that there were two different Sarvajha-Naiayanas, both commentators
of well-known works on Dharmasastra like the Mahabharata and the
Manusmrti.

The date of Sarvajna has been fixed on the basis of certain quotations.^

^ This important passage was verified by me in a MS. of Sarvajha's com-
mentary deposited at the Institute, namely, Bombay Government Collection No. 33
of A 1879-80 (fol. 194^).

Buhler cautiously remarks that Sarvajna-Narayaiua ‘'cannot have written
later than in the last half of the fourteenth century/’^ but the recent resear-
ches of Kane tend to show that Sarvajna flourished between a.d. 1100 and
1300.^

(zf) Arjimamisra.^

Both Devabodha and Sarvajna are mentioned and cited several times by
the Bengali commentator Arjunamisra, the manner in which Arjunamisra
refers to Devabodha suggesting that in his time Devabodha’s commentary
possessed an established reputation. These references are as follows :

(a) In the foreword to his scholium (Bombay Govt. Coll. No. 30 of
A 1879-80 = Dai of the Critical Edition), Arjuna pays homage to his prede-
cessors, citing by name several of them. Devabodha, he mentions with
special reverence, whose commentary (among others) he had carefully
studied before writing his own commentary on the Mbh.:

Worth noting is the fact that in the long series of names of Bharata-
caryas cited by Arjuna at the beginning of the above extract, the
first four names Vyasa and Vai§almpayana, Devabodha £190} and Sarv^ajna
have been recited in the correct order of precedence and chronology, a point
to which we shall return in the sequel.

(b) Arjuna mentions the Acaryas again in the list of his (immediate
and remote) “Gurus’', placing this time Devabodha at the head of the list,
which ends with the name of his father, who (as we know from other sources)
was a well-known reciter {pdthakaY of the Mbh.

JIRPm ^ 5^^ WT II

(c) In the short introduction which prefaces his conunentary on the
Virata,-’ Arjuna twice mentions Devabodha, once to give expression to the
high esteem in which Arjuna holds him and again to record his gratefulness
to his illustrious predecessor :

(d) Finally, while commenting on 1. 143. 34 (a difficult stanza, giving
a fanciful derivation of the name Ghatotkaca), Arjuna mentions two read-
ings which had both won the approval of Devabodha :

(sic) 1 ^

These two readings are in fact mentioned by Devabodha : vide fol. 37^
of the Baroda MS. of Devabodha's commentary on the Adi.

The above extracts taken together indisputably prove that Arjunamisra
was posterior to both Devabodha and Sarvajna-Narayaiia. Adding the name
of Arjunamisra to Series 1, we get

Series 2: D ev a^b o dha — Sarvajna — Arjunamisra,

Some faint light on the question of the age of Arjunamisra is thrown by
a dated MS. of Arjuna's commentary listed by the late M. M. Haraprasada
Sastri in his Notices of Sanskrit MSS., Second £191} Series, Vol. I (Cal-
cutta 1900), p. 298 (MS. No. 295). The late Mahamahopadhyaya reported
that it was a carefully written palm-leaf MS. of Arjuna’s commentary on the
Mokiadharma, called Moksadharmdrthadlpikd written in archaic Bengali
characters and belonging, apparently, to Babu Saradaprasanna Ghose of
Kelomal, Tamluk. The MS- gave the date of writing as Saka 1456 (ca.
A.D. 1534).®

I may here draw attention to some stanzas added by the copyist, which
are to the eiffect that already at the time when the copy was made, correct
MSS. of Arjuna’s commentary were a rarity even in Bengal, the home of the
commentator, which can only be explained by assuming, as pointed out
already by Mahadeva Shastri Bakre that there was a considerable interval
of time between the two. The stanzas I am ref ei ring to are :

%5iT srsjuiwft

The date iSaka 1456 (ca. a. d. 1534) is then the lower limit of the age of
Axjuna, but the date of Arjuna, if we rely on the information vouchsafed by
the copyist, must be long prior to A. d. 1534.

(Hi) Nilaka^tha.

We return to NHakaibtha, who is the next great Mbh. commentator, and
who cites or mentions Devabodha, Sarvajfia-Naray^ and Arjunamisra, not

parvan, Introduction, p. 6.

indeed in the introduction to his commentary on the Mbh., where he mentions
a number of his ‘‘ Gurus ”, but elsewhere in the course of his well-known
scholium. Here are the references.

(a) While commenting on 1. 158. 14, a stanza with numerous variants,
Nilakajitha cites an old variant of the entire stanza, mentioning Devabodha
in that connection.

iT ^V- fr ^ ^ 1

1% m ii

[192} 5JI^: I '■

it is worthy of note that Nilakantha regards the variants as ancient,
owing to its having been explained by ” Devabodha and others ”. He must
therefore consider Devabodha as an ancient authority.

What N51akai.itha regards as ancient is of course a matter for specula-
tion. Nevertheless I do not think that Nilakajntha would have used the word
pTdctna in connection with Devabodha unless the interval between them was
at least three or four centuries.

In passir'g it may be mentioned that this reference to Devabodha by
Nilakaintha is yet another instance of the practice of mentioning names of
Acaryas honoris causa (pujMham)," because the reading cited by Nila-
kaotha is probably not that of Devabodha at all, who to judge by the lem-
mata in his commentary must have had before him a stanza differing from
the corresponding stanza of the Critical Ekiition merely in reading sakundh
for kutitapdli of the Critical Edition (1. 158. 14). The third pada of the
stanza as cited by Nilakahtha is certainly the reading of the T G version,
found otherwise only in three conflated N MSS., and in a fourth one written
in the margin ; while the last pada was found by me only in four MSS. (Kg
Ba M 3 . 5 ) of my critical apparatus, one of them (B 3 ) having as a matter of
fact the reading of our text in the margin ! It is therefore most improbable
that Devabodha had commented on the particular variant version cited by
Nllakaptha, and it is really doubtful to me whether Nilkaajtha had at all
Devabodha’ s commentary before him. Devabodha is referred to by Nila-
kaiptha merely as one of the ancient Acaryas.

(b) While commenting on B. 7. 82. 2, Nilakamtha notices a variant
interpretation of madhuparkika given by Devabodha :

(c) NSlakaiotha’s reference to Sarvajna will be found in his comment
on B. 5 . 40. 10 (Gujarati Printing Press ed., p. 131) :

and afeain in the same adhyaya, a few stanzas further on (B. 5. 40. 26),
we find ;

I JIRFPir: I I

^ BTit arrai^einJ: I

A reference to Sarvajna's commentary printed in the same work
(p. 131 f.) will show that all these explanations do as a matter of fact occur
in the commentary of Sarvajha, while they are not met with in any of the
three other commentaries printed there.

(d) For Nilakaotha’s mention of Arjunamisra, I may draw attention tc
Nilakajptha’s comment on B. 3. 291. 70, a stanza at the end of the Ramo
pakhyana, where he mentions various explanations of the word jdruthya,
among them the one given by Arjunamisra, whom he mentions by name :

These various extracts establi^ the posteriority of Nilakaajtha to Deva-
bodha, Sarvajha-Narayana and Arjunamisra. Adding Nilakantha to
Series 2, we get

Series 3 : Devabodh a — S ar v a j n a —

Ar junamisr a — N ilakaritha.

It will be remembered that as each member of this series of four names
clearly cites one or more of his predecessors, this is a chronological sequence
whose correctness is absolutely incontrovertible.

( iv ) Vimalabodha.

There is moreover a subsidiary series connected with a Mbh. commen-
tator called Vimalabodha,^ to which we shall now turn our attention.

It will be recalled that in the excerpts given above from the commentary
of Arjunamisra, the commentator twice mentions Vimalabodha in close proxi-
mity to Devabodha. Therefore it is evident that Arjunamisra is posterior
to Vimalabodha, whose commentary (tika) variously known as Durghafartha-
prakdsim £194} or Vi^amasloki has fortunately been preserved. In the intro-
duction to this unpublished commentary, a copy of which is to be found in
the Bombay Government Collection (No. 84 of 1869-70), while speaking of
his predecessors, Vimalabodha says (fol. 1) :

II

Again while giving the etymologies of the name of the Suta, Loma- (or
Roma-)har§a|ija, Vimalabodha observes (fol. 2) ;

See Holtzmann, op. cit. vol. Z, p. 72.



EPIC STUDIES V


271


Undoubtedly the Devasvamin mentioned in the first excerpt is the same
as the Devabodha (who in the colophons of his commentary is styled parama-
hmhsa-pmvrdjakdcdrya) in the second. Incidentally it may be pointed out
that the etymology of Loma- (or Roma-)har§aipa mentioned by Vimalabodha
is actually to be found in Devabodha’s scholium. In the Baroda MS.
(11372) of the unpubli^ed commentary of Devabodha, we read (fol. 3 b,
line If.):

^fTT i ,

which substantially agrees with the excerpt in the commentary of Vimala-
bodh^.

Since Arjunamisra mentions Vimalabodha, and Vimalabodha cites Deva-
bodha, we get a subsidiary series, namely.

Series 4 : Devabodh a — V im\alabodh a — A rjunamisra.

Thus far we have been treading on solid ground and the correctness of
Series 1-4 is, as far as I can judge, absolutely unimpeachable.

In trying to combine Series 3 and 4, however, there arises the difficulty
that no cross reference has hitherto been found in the works of Vimalabodha
on the one hand and Sarvajna-Narayana on the other. Their relative chrono-
logical position is, therefore, a matter for speculation. It is possible, how-
ever, to combine the two series tentotivelyf on the equivocal testimony of
Arjunamisra, which we shall proceed to examine more closely.

£195} In one of the lists of the Acaryas cited by Arjunamisra, we have
the sequence , Veda-Vyasa, Vaisaiiipayana, Devabodha, Vimalabodha,
Sarvajna-Narayaipa, San^cjilya Madhava. Here the first two pairs, as was
pointed out above, have been named in the correct chronological order, the
earlier author being placed first, in conformity with the rule governing the
sequence of the members of a Dvandva compound (P. 2.2.34 Va. ). Deva-
bodha is, as we have seen, prior to Vimalabodha as surely as Vyasa, the
reputed author of the Great Epic, is prior to Vaisaimpayana. Further in
both lists the father of Arjunami!§ra is mentioned last. These facts suggest
the surmise that the whole series is arranged in the strict chronological
sequence. If this surmise be correct, then Sarvajna-NaiayaTja would be
posterior to Vimalabodha, and we get, tentatively, the sequence : Vimala-
bodha — Sarvajfia.

It may, however, be noted that such names are often found arranged on
the diametrically opposite principle of uttaroitmaganyastva, i.e., naming the
more important persons later, which is however not admissible in the parti-
cular instance ; or even a;rranged on no principle at all ; or at least on some
principle which it is difficult for us to comprehend. In fact a subsequent
enumeration of these same Acaryas by the same Arjunamisra is in partial
conflict with the earlier list ! There the sequence (already given above) is



272


EPIC STUDIES


Devabodha, Vimalabodha, Saiidilya Madhava, Niarayaina-Sarvajfla. Here
Sarvajna-Narayana has been placed after isandilya Madhava, while in the
former list he is placed bepre them ! This irregularity apart, the lists tally
with each other.

It is not, however, impossible to resolve this contradiction and harmonize
the data. There is a notable difference between the two lists. The first one
is in prose, the ^ond is an anu^ubh stanza. I am disposed to attach more
importance to the sequence of the prose enumeration, and to regard the change
of sequence in the other as due to the exigencies of metre. The first again
is a formal expression of homage {namaskriyd) , where the principle of prior-
ity has been, it seems, rigidly observed ; on the other hand, the second is
merely a collective metrical list of the author’s “ Gurus,” where the considera-
tion of rank and precedence did {196} not perhaps prevail so much. I may
also point out tliat the first list is in the form of a Dvandva compound, while
in the second the persons have been all independently mentioned. If these
considerations have any value, then we may postulate, at least tentatively,
another series.

Series 5 : D ev Ub o dk a — V imalabod h a —

Sarv a jn a — A r fun a—N xlakantha,

where the relative position of Vimalabodha and Sarvajna alone is open to
doubt.

Of these five commentators, as was mentioned above, Sarvajna could not
have lived later than the latter half of the fourteenth century and flourished
probably between a. d, 1100 and 1300 ; while Arjunami^ra lived some time
prior to a. d. 1534.^ Moreover, if the position assigned in Series 5 to
Sarvajna be correct, then both Devabodha and Vimalabodha must have lived
long prior to A. D. 1300.^

§ 2. What was Devabodha’s Version of the Mahabharata Like ?

The only commentary of the Mahabharata completely printed so far is

1 Since the above was written, two efforts have been made to fix the date of
Arjunamisra. Mr. Jogendra Chandra Ghosh (Indian Culture, Vol. I, p. 706 ff.),
working on the data supplied by certain ancient pedigrees preserved in Bengal,
arrives at the date ca. a.d. 1300 for Arjunamilra ; but it may be pointed out that
the method of fixing precise dates on the basis of pedigrees alone never gives entirely
reliable results. On the other hand, Mr. P. K. Code of the Bhandarkar Institute
(Indian Culture, Vol. 2, p. 141 ff.), relying on his identification of the &tya-Khana,
who was a patron of Arjunamisra (see Sir f. J. Modi Commemoration Volume,
p. 566), argues for a date between a.d. 1450 and a.d. 15(K), There is thus a
difference of about 200 years between the two computations. But the matter is still
sub judice, and more li^t on the questicm may be expected from further investiga-
tion of the questicMi which is being carried on by these two sdiolars.

the Bhdratabhdvadtpa by Nilakantha. The Gujarati Printing Press of Bom-
bay has done, however, inestimable service to the cause of Mahabharata
studies by publishing other commentaries at least on the Virata and Udyoga,
edited by Mahadeva Shastri £197} Bakre. The Vinataparvan Volume
(published in 1915) contains, besides (1) the Bhdmtabhdvadipa, the com-
mentaries of (2) Arjunamisra, (3) Caturbhuja, (4) Vimalabodha, (5)
Ramakr§i:ia, (6) Sarvajha-Narayana and (7) Vadiraja, as also a commentary
called (8) the Vi^amapadavivarma of unknown authorship. The Udyoga-
parvan Volume (published in 1920) includes, on the other hand, besides (1)
the Bhdratabhdmdipa, the commentaries of (2) Arjunami§ra, (3) Vimala-
bodha, (4) Sarvajha-Narayaina and (5) Vadiraja.^ A commentary more
important than any of these and one more neglected still is the Jndnadlpikd
of Devabodha. Until recently nothing was in fact known about Devabodha
or his commentary on the Mahabharata save what is contained in perfunctory
notices of Sanskrit MSS., which has been summarized in Holtzman's meri-
torious work Das Mahdbhdrata (Vol. 3, section 14, para 3, p. 70 f.). A
selection of Devabodha’s readings and glosses was for the first time published
by me in che critical notes of the Adiparvan Volume.^

I have shown in the previous section that Devabodha is indubitably
earlier than Nllakaipta, Arjunamisra, Satvajna-Narayana or even Vimala-
bodha, and is therefore in all probability the earliest commentator of the
Mahabharata hitherto known. It is therefore needless to add that the com-
mentary is most valuable and its evidence, both positive and negative, of
supreme importance for the constitution of the text.

The MS. of the commentary (which is unaccompanied by the epic text)
utilized by me for the Adi belongs to the Baroda Central Library (Sanskrit
Section) and was kindly placed at my disposal by Dr. Benoytosh Bhatta-
CHARYA, Director of the Oriental Institute of Baroda, to whom my sincere
thanks are due for the kind loan.^ This paper MS. which bears the identifi-
cation No. 11372, contains the commentary on Adi only and is written
in £198} Devanagaii characters of about the seventeenth century. The bulk
of the MS. is in a fair state of preservation, though in many places the text
is extremely corrupt. In our MS. the name of the commentary is given as
Jndnadlpikd ; but, according to HOLTZMANN {op, cit. Vol. 3, p. 71), it is also
known as Mahdhhdrata-tdtparyafikd or tdtparyadlpikd. MSS. of this com-
mentary a‘re rare, and no complete copy has yet been found.


1 Vadiraja's cammentary on the Sabha has been published by Prof. P. P.
Subrahmanya Sastri as an Appendix to his edition of the Sabha according t e
Southern recension (Madras 1932). For Vadiraja^s date see further below (pp. 20i-

EPIC STUDIES


In the colophon the author is described as paramahamsa-parivrdjaka.
He must therefore have belonged to an order of Sairiinyasins. The name of
his Guru is given as Satyabodha. This is all the personal data we have at
present about Devabodha.

The Jndnadtpikd is a concise flka, that is, a running commentary para-
phrasing the difficult words of the epic text and occasionally explaining the
gist or purport { tat par y a) of the original. The extent of the text of the
commentary on the Adi is given at the end of our MS. as 1,400 granthas.

The homage which Arjuna pays to Devabodha in the Introduction to his
scholium is by no means a matter of mere form. Arjuna appears to have
made a very close study indeed of the scholium of Devabodha, and based his
own commaitary, on the Adi at least, largely on that of his predecessor. He
has copied very large portions of Devabodha’s commentary, sometimes ver-
batim, sometimes in extracts. Moreover, even when the commentators differ,
the influence of Devabodha is plainly discernible. In fact, Arjuna’s Artha-
dtpikd may be considered, as I have remarked elsewhere,^ as a revised and
enlarged edition of Devabodha's Jndnadlpikd. Unlike the commentary of
Nllakaiotha, that of Devabodha is unaccompanied by the epic text. The
question, therefore, naturally arises what was Devabodha’s text like ?

When we read the commentary along with any of the old printed edi-
tions of the Mahabharata, like the Calcutta or the Bombay or the Kumbha-
fconam editions, we are at once struck by the singular disparity between the
text and the commentary. Not only does Devabodha's commentary contain
many words or expressions which do not occur at all in the Vulgate, but it
also cites, at times, verses or stanzas which read differently in the
£199} Vulgate, One also comes across passages and even adhyayas of the
Vulgate on which one expects some comment but which are left wholly un-
commented by Devabodha.

The Southern recension may be categorically ignored in our search for
the protot)q)e of Devabodha’s commentary, as this comtnentator does not
know even ?i single one of the many passages peculiar to the Southern recen-
sion. He further does not show the typical Southern transposition of the
Sakuntala and Yayiati episodes, nor the characteristic position of the prose
genealogical axihyaya (called puruvamSdnuh^tam) , after the chapter con-
taining the eulogy of the epic (JShdrataprasamsd) ,

The vulgate (with the Bengali) may likewise be excluded. It agrees
with Devabodha’s text up to a certain point ; but the divergences, which are
numerous, remain inexplicable. There remain then only the garada and the
“ K ” versiems. And with them, the version of Devabodha does, as a matter
of fact, show very close aflSnity.

It is worthy of note that Devabodha has no commentary on any of the

six adhyiayas of the Vulgate which are completely missing in the Sarada and
the K MSS. and which have also been completely omitted in the Critical Edi-
tion of the Adi. They are the following adhyiayas of the Vulgate : (i) adhy.
22 (duplicate description of the ocean) ; (ii) adhy. 24 (Aruna is appointed
charioteer of the Sun, an evident digression and interpolation) ; (iii) adhy.
116 (birth of Dubl^a : a fairy tale of questionable authenticity) ; (iv)
adhy, 139 (an absurd chapter describing further exploits of the Pans^Javas
and containing a reference to Yavana kings) ; (v) adhy, 140 (Kanikanati) ;
and finally, (vi) adhy. 149 (Paijdavas’ crossing the Ganges, a passage of
doubtful value).

But on principle, we cannot attach very great importance to such omis-
sions, as a commentator is apt to skip in the Mahabharata any adyhaya which
he thinks too simple to need any comment. This explanation will apply to
most of the omissions mentioned above, but will not hold good in the case of
the Kanikaniti an adhy. of 140 stanzas, which has evoked lengthy comments
from both Arjunamijsra and Nilakantha ; we expect some comment on this
adhyaya by a commentator like Devabodha.

{200} Much more important from our point of view is an addition
characteristic of the Kasmiri version,. This version adds at the very end of
the Adi a supplementary (and entirely superfluous) adhyaya, which contains
merely a variant version of the well-known Purapic tale of Svetaki s sacrifice,
occurring earlier in the course of this very parvan, and which was known to
K§emendra. Curiously enough the king who is called i§vetaki in the first
version is here called Svetaketu ! That the version of Devabodha contained
this interpolated (supplementary) adhyaya is proved by the concluding
remark of Devabodha on this adhyaya (fol. 48) :

^ 1

This remark, as I have pointed out elsewhere, will not apply to any ver-
sion which did not have the supplementary adhyaya containing the story of
gvetaketu, which in fact is peculiar to the §arada and the K versions. These
facts demonstrate that the version of Devabodha agrees with the Sara^ and
K versions with respect to both addition and omission of whole adhyayas.

The conclusion regarding the affinity between the two versions is fortified
by many minor agreements in point of shorter passages and even readings of
individual stanza^s.

For example, Devabodha has no comment on any portion of the Brahma-
Ga|Qie§a episode (40 stanzas in thq Vulgate), which is missing in its entirety
only in the Kasmiii and the Bengali versions. Again, for 1. 105. 4-7 of the
Critical Edition the Vulgate substitutes a lengthy passage of 56 lines, which
is entirely ignored in the commentary of Devabodha, who on the other hand
cites 7^^ (a line not known to the Vulgate), in exact agreement with the



276 EPIC STUDIES

Sarada and K versions (besides the Southern recension), but in direct oppo-
siticai to the Bengali and the Devaniagari versions. In connection with the
omission of. adhy. 139-140 of the Vulgate mentioned above, the iSarada and
K versions omit the first 19 stanzas of the following adhyiaya (namely, adhy.
141 of the Vulgate) . In conformity with that, the first 19 stanzas of adhy.
141 are ignored completely in the scholium of Devabodha. It may be noted
that the omission of adhy. 130-140 together with the first 19 stanzas of adhy.
141 of the Vulgate £201} makes an aggregate and continuous omission of 1.39
(=27 + 93-f-19) stanzas of the Vulgate, a not inconaderable portion of the
text. Likewise there is no commentary on nearly 70 stanzas of adhy. 128
and 129 of the Vulgate, which ate omitted only in the Sarada-K group and
the Critical Eldition.

This affinity is further borne out by agreements as regards minor read-
ings too numerous to mention.

These considerations make it, in my opinion, perfectly clear that the
version of Devabodha is closely allied to the Sarada and K versions.

Though the isarada version and what I have called the “ K ” version run
for the most part parallel to each other, there are in fact minor discrepancies
between the MSS. of these versions, which indicate different sources. But as,
on the one hand, we have for the Adi a solitary MS. (6i) of the genuine
iSarada (or Kasmiri) version, and on the other hand we do not know the
provenance of the Devanagari MSS. which I have denoted by the symbol
“K” (on account of their affinity to the version of Ka4mir), it is at this
stage not easy to explain these discrepancies between i^iarada and K. It would
be also premature to say whether Devabodha’s version was more akin to
Sarada or the K version.

I may, however, draw attention to one instance which suggests to my
mind and affinity with K rather than with the Sarada version. In 1. 68. 72
the text reading is asatyavacam nary ah (nom. plu.), “women (are) perfidi-
ous,” a general statement. Only Kj.j Bj (m as in text) have, on the other
hand, asatyavacane ’ndrye (voc. sing.), “0 thou perfidious (and) dishonour-
able (woman) ! ” Ko ,4 appear to have corrupt forms of the same. The
vocative appears to be, therefore, peculiar to the K version, which differs here
from the Sarada, and which latter has the nom. plu. as in all other MSS.
Now in agreemait with K, Devabodha has amrye = vakre ! One instance of
an agreement like this is, I will readily admit, wholly inadequate to prove the
point. It can only give an indication and may perchance give wrong
indication. The question may, therefore, be left over for future investigation.
