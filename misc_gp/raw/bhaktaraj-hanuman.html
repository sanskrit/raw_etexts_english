<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रनवउँ पवनकुमार खल बन पावक ग्यान घन।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जासु हृदय आगार बसहिं राम सर चाप धर॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Salutation to the son of wind-god, who is as it were, fire to forest of the wicked, an embodiment of wisdom and whose heart is the abode of Lord Ram wielding a bow and arrows.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Shankar was gracing a superior peak of Kailash mountain along with chaste Bhagawati. Under the dense shadow of banyan tree, his white body like camphor was brightening with the scattered matted hair of brown colour on his body. In his hand there was a rosary of Rudraksh beads, in the neck garland of snakes and infront, ‘Nandi’ was sitting. His hosts and attendants were busy in different types of amusing activities at some distance from his seat. Due to the presence of moon and nectarial current of the holy Ganga on his head, the unbearable traverse blaze of his third eye was calm. The ashes-smeared forehead seemed to be very charming.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Suddenly, chanting ‘Ram-Ram’ he broke his trance. The chaste goddess Sati saw that Lord Shankar was staring at her with an unique idea. She stood before Him and began to pray with folded hands very humbly—“My Lord! What service should I render you at present? Do you have any desire to express? Your facial appearance does indicate so.” Lord Shankar said—‘Dear beloved! <span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>oday, in my mind, an auspicious thought is taking shape. I am thinking that My Lord, in whose memory I remain engrossed day and night regularly and repeating His name, I am getting puffed up with joy and remembering His real form, I go into a trance, forgetting everything, the same my God, the same my Lord is incarnating in this human world. All the gods are desireous to avail an opportunity for rendering their services to Him by incarnating simultaneously. Then, why should I alone, remain deprived of this golden opportunity? I, too, should go there and rendering my services to Him, I should fulfil my yearning of the ages long and make my life fruitful.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing these words of Lord Shankar, the chaste Sati could not decide at once that, what was proper and what improper. There were two considerations in her mind at that time. The first was that her husband’s wish must be accomplished and the second was that there must not be his separation from her. After pondering something, she said—‘My Lord! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>our resolution is appreciable, just as I want to remain always in the service of my deity—yourself, similarly you too, want to offer your services to your deity. But being afraid of your separation, I don’t know how unsteady my heart is going to be. Be kind enough to grant me such a devotion as I may feel happy in your happiness, pleasures and my mind may be diverted to consider accordingly. There is one thing more, this time, the incarnation of God is to kill Ravan, who is your great devotee, he has sacrificed even his heads having cut them off, in your worship. In such a situation, how can you assist in killing him?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Shankar began to laugh. He said—‘Goddess! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou are quite simpleton. There is no question of separation here. I will serve Him having incarnated with my one form and remaining in the other form, I will live with you and show you the frolicsome plays of God and from time to time going there, I will offer my prayer and adoration to Him. As regards your second anxiety, it is no matter as Ravan has worshipped me devotedly, at the same time, he has neglected my one aspect also. You do know it very well that I live in eleven forms. When he had adored me offering his ten heads, he had disregarded one form of mine. Now, I can fight against him in that very form and simultaneously, I can render my services to my deity also. I have determined to incarnate from the womb of Anjana through wind-God. Now, I hope, your worry should be no more; the chaste Bhagawati got delighted.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a nymph in Amaravati of Indra named Punjikasthal. One day, she happened to commit a vice, as a result she had to be born on the earth in the form of she-monkey.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After a great prayer, the sage who cursed her, had favoured her that she might change her guise and assume herself in any form whenever and whatever she liked. It was she to decide about her form whether she wanted to guise in she-monkey form and when to remain in the human form. The Lord of the monkeys Keshari adopted her as his wife. She was exquisitely beautiful and Keshari loved her very much.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, both of them disguised in human form, were strolling on the peaks of Sumeru. It was breezing. By a light gust, the border of her Sari soared up. Anjana felt as if someone was touching her. Controlling her garments, she stood aside. Scolding, she said—‘Who is such an impudent who wants to violate my chastity to my husband. My deity-husband is present with me and someone wants to ruin my fidelity to my husband! I will just now burn him to ashes with my curse.’ It seemed to her as if Vayudev was saying—‘Goddess! I have not defiled your chastity. O Goddess! Such a son will be born to you, who will be equal in might as myself, none will stand before him in prowess and intelligence. I will protect him and he will be devotee of God.’ Then, Anjana and Keshari went to their place. Lord Shankar’s aspect entered the womb of Anjana through her ear.*</p>

<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-9">(The body which is devoted to Ram, is respected and honoured by great men therefore, having abandoned the image of Rudra, out of great love for and Lord Ram, Lord Shankar became a monkey—Hanuman. Knowing well the service to Ram being very delicious, having presumed it so, He became an attendant from vitality and the Lord Shankar shifted Himself from Hara to ‘Hanuman’).</span><span class="char-style-override-10"> </span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was the month of ‘Chaitra Shukla 15’* and the day Tuesday, when Lord Shankar incarnated in the form of a monkey. Anjana and Keshari were overjoyed. Like the moon of ‘Shuklapaksh’ (moon-lit fortnight of a month) growing day by day, the child began to be brought up with concentrated mind. If Anjana went anywhere, she clung him to her bosom, Keshari sprang up having seated the child on his back and seeing his infant jocund, he used to be delighted himself.</p>
<p class="Footnotes"><span class="char-style-override-9">* </span><span class="char-style-override-11">Some are of the opinion that Hanuman’s date of birth is ‘Kartik Krishna 14 or ‘Kartik Shukla 15’.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, Anjana went somewhere to bring frugivore, leaving the child alone at the home. Keshari was already out of the house. The child was all alone in the house and he was feeling appetite. He glanced at here and there, but found nothing. At last, his sight fell upon ‘Sun’. It was morning. He considered it a very red delightful fruit and it would be useful to eat and play both. The child tried to reach to the Sun. The wind had already given him power to fly or it may be interpreted in another way as what is there to be amazed in Lord Shankar’s display of frolicsome activities.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This child began to fly in the sky. The gods, demons, demigods etc., were amazed to see him. Even the wind itself got suspicious. My this small child is rushing towards the ‘Sun’. By the bitterly pungent rays of the midday-sun, he might be burnt. He collected coolness from the Himalaya and the Malayachal hills and began to follow his son. The ‘Sun’ too glanced at it. This outstanding characteristic of the child could not remain hidden before his divine sight. A number of specualations came to his mind. The Sun saw Lord Shankar himself, in the guise of a child monkey coming to me. This also could not remain secret to him that the child was born by the blessings of wind-god who was like his father and he, himself was coming to protect the child. The solar god cooled his rays and touching with his delicate hands he was patting his younger brother affectionately or he began to welcome warmly seeing Lord Shankar—‘the father of the world, approaching to him.’ That child reached the solar chariot and began to amuse with him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was eclipse that day. Keeping in mind the opportune moment, Rahu came to eclipse the sun. He saw that a child was sitting on the solar-chariot. First, Rahu did not care, he pounced upon the sun like as before. But when he was caught by the hard clutches of the child, he got afraid and ran away escaping himself. He directly went to Lord Indra, the god of gods. Reaching there he urged to Lord Indra—‘O the king of gods! You have given me right to eclipse the sun. Have you shifted this right to any other one also?’ Lord Indra could not understand the mystery. Rebuking Rahu, He sent Rahu again. Seeing Rahu for the second time, the child came to remember his appetite. He thought that it was an appropriate object to eat. Sufficient enough! <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>e pounced upon Rahu. Rahu got afraid with the glow of the child and began to call-out Indra to protect him. Lord Indra rushed riding His Airawata to protect him. Just seeing Airawata, the child released Rahu and considering it a delicious fruit, he rushed to catch it. Now being frightened, Lord Indra threw His thunderbolt at him and the child’s left chin (Hanu) cracked. Being fallen on the mountain and wounded, the child began to tumble about.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having lifted the child, Vayudev took him into a cave. He got furious at Indra and he seized his own movement. Due to the wind being motionless, all turned to wood-like. In all the three worlds, none could move. The breath of all stopped. All the gods got perplexed. Indra rushed to Brahma. At the same moment the ‘Brahma’ came into the cave of the hill and touching by his hand to the child, He made him alive. The child stood up happily. Vayudev became very happy and he infused life throughout all the worlds. Lord Brahma said to the gods that this is not a common child. He has appeared only to get the works done in favour of gods, so, it is proper for all the gods to grant him boons. Lord Indra said—‘Since, my thunderbolt has broken his chin, hence, from today he will be called by the name of Hanuman and I grant him the boon that my thunderbolt will not work upon him and he will remain unscatched before it.’ The sun said—‘I bestow the hundredth portion of my glow upon him. By my power, he will be able to change his image and whenever he longs on to learn and study the Sastras, I will make him study all the Sastras. He will be a great eloquent.’ Varun granted him boon to remain fearless from water and his noose. The other gods like Kuber etc., also made Hanuman to remain fearless from their side. Vishwakarma granted him boon to remain unaffected and not to be killed by the divine ammunitions made by him and Lord Brahma, besides imparting him the knowledge of Brahma, blessing him with long life. He freed him from the ‘Brahmastra’ and ‘Brahmapash’ also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While departing, Lord Brahma said to Vayudev—‘Your son will be valiant beyond limit, disguiser of form according to his will and swifter like mind, His movement will be unhampered, His repute will be immortal and in the battle between Ram and Ravan, he will be assistant to Ram and his great beloved.’ Thus, all the gods went to their respective abode having granted boons to Hanuman. Hearing all this, the immense joy what Anjana and Keshari felt, is beyond description at all.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the childhood, Hanuman was very naughty. First of all, he was a monkey, the next to it, he was a child and the third one, along with it, was such a great power he had been granted by the gods! There was already the aspect of the Rudra (Shankar) in him and he used to hang the throne-seats of the sages on the trees having lifted them, poured down the water of their water pots with a spout and used to tear off their lion-cloth. Sometimes, he played sitting in laps of one or another and abruptly scratching his beard, used to run away. Nobody could check him forcibly, all were helpless. He grew up, the time of schooling approached but his restiveness remained as usual. Anjana and Keshari were very much worried. They did adopt the way whatever could be possible to restrain him, but Hanuman could not be brought round. They prayed to the sages—‘Be kind to favour us, only then, he can be brought round.’ All sages having thought over the matter very seriously that he is extremely proud of his strength and vitality and if he forgets his capacity, then everything will be set aright. They cursed Hanuman—‘Forget your prowess. When anybody reminds you of your prowess and repute, you will come to your real one as it is, after recollecting your vitality.’ Hanumanji forgot his total power.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the time of his education came upon. The king of monkeys, Keshari sent him to the Sun to study the Vedas having done the proper sacrament. Hanuman studied there all the Vedas and all the six branches of Vedas. There was no question for him to study the Vedas, he was the manifestation of Lord Shankar himself; even though to protect the religious tradition and tradition sanctity, he studied all the knowledge and science. Within a very short time he came back to his parents. The parents were highly joyous to see their son well versed of the knowledge by the solar grace.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Ram had already incarnated. Lord Shankar usually used to visit Ayodhya to view his frolicsome sports as a child and stayed there at Ayodhya. Someday disguising as an astrologer, he used to read the trait of His palm and the other day blessed Him diguising as a beggar. When Lord Ram, began to come out of the palace to play, one day a juggler happened to come. He had a very handsome dancer-monkey with him. Playing upon the ‘Damaru’ (tabor) he occured to reach the gate of the royal palace. A number of boys gathered there. Lord Ram along with his brothers also came upon. This monkey was not a common monkey at all, it was Lord Shiv himself, having appeared in the form of Hanuman with a certain motive to please his deity Lord Ram. He was both, a dancer and caused to dance also. Why was for all this, it was only to view the pleasing sporting of his Lord, to play with him and for His merriment.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ultimately, God was charmed. Having seen the dance of the monkey, all began to return, but the Lord stood still. He began to say—I insist to take this monkey. How could the obstinacy of the Prince be resolved? The king Dasharath ordered the juggler to handover the monkey to the Prince—Shyamasundar at any amount whatever he wanted in return. Really, it was not the amount for which the juggler had come, he had intentionally come to dedicate himself to the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Ram took over the monkey in his own hands. Till then he was causing himself to dance and now, God became the owner to make him dance, and he, himself, became the dancer. The craving of ages long was fulfilled, he began to dance being overpowered by joy, all were absorbed in seeing the dance of the monkey and the juggler disappeared. God knows, whether the juggler merged into the monkey or having his work completed, he went away to Kailash.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this form, Hanuman remained attending and offering his services to Ram and amusing Him. When Vishwamitra came to take away Ram and Lakshman with him, God, then, having called him in at a lonely place persuaded him. He said—‘Hanuman! You are my close friend from the core and corner of my heart, my any sportive activity is not hidden to you. In the coming days later on, I will kill Ravan. At that time I will require a good number of monkeys. Ravan has got Vali associated with himself. Khar-Dusan, Trishira, Shurpanakha are there in the Dandak Van; Maricha, Subahu, Tadaka are in my neighbourhood, their net has spread all around. Meeting to Sabari, you go to the Rishyamuk mountain and there, make friendship with Sugriv. By and by making the way clear, I will reach there and you will ensure Sugriv meet me there and marshal an army of the monkeys. Then after killing Ravan, the purpose of incarnation will be fulfilled.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though, Hanuman was not willing to leave the Lord, yet he accepted His instructions reverently, and repeating His name, he set out for the Rishyamuk mountain.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-3-2">(2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being afraid of Bali, Sugriv, along with his attending ministers lived at the Rishyamuk mountain, those days. Hanuman was also with them. Generally, Sugriv used to remain frightened as any one close to Bali might not attack him on his persuation; because Bali, himself, could not come there due to a curse. One day, he was going through a political discussion with his ministers and his near and dear Hanuman sitting there together. All of a sudden, his sight was attracted towards Pampasar. He saw that two armed men were standing there. Their motive is not clear exactly but they seem to be in search of someone. Sugriv got suspicious to see their manners, gallant body, their arms and ammunitions and so also their garment made of bark and their matted hair. He asked Hanuman—‘Brother! find out, who are these two brave persons? If they belong to enemy side, let us move away from here and if they are disheartened and they too, are also in need of help, let us befriend them and let us be helpful to each other to attain the respective goal. Find out their motive disguised as a celibate. Then, inform me by indication whatever the matter is.’ Hanuman obeyed his order.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the advice of Sugriv, Hanuman went to them disguised in the form of a Brahman. After the formal and befitting salutation and welcome, he asked them about their introduction admiring the both. He said—‘Seeing your arms and ammunitions and your well-built body, it appears that you are brave persons. Watching your soft feet, it seems that you are the resident of any royal palace and you have never got to live in the forest or on any mountain. Seeing your outer appearance, it can be assumed merely that you are the seer youths; but it is uncertain at all. Your facial glow indicates clearly that you are not common men, rather super-natural. Are you anyone out of the three gods? Probably, lest it might be so are you apparantly ‘Nar-Naryan’ in person? I am in a fix of suspicion. A great attraction in you is attracting me towards yourself and my mind is getting fascinated by your splendour and gracefulness, you seem to be the most affectionate to me. I have ever been with you, my heart hints it again and again, kindly, remove the veil of my suspicion.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Ram was listening to the words of Hanuman smiling mildly. Looking towards Lakshman, he said—‘This Brahman is very wise. His expression speaks that he has studied the Vedas minutely from the beginning to the end. There is not a single mistake in his speech. There is no symptom at all in his feature that indicates his foul motive. He is worthy of being the noble minister of any king. The style of his pronunciation and didactic policy both are sound and impressive.’ By Ram’s indication, Lakshman said—‘O the Brahman-god! We are the sons of King Dasharath, the king of Ayodhya. To obey his order we have come here in the forest for fourteen years. Here, some demon has kidnapped Sita, the daughter of Janaka. We are loitering here and there in her search. Now, you introduce yourself.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hardly, Lakshman had finished his version than Hanuman’s form changed. He fell down on the feet of Lord Ram in his monkey form. There was an inner-conflict in his mind at that time that he had come before the Lord in disguise, this was a type of deception, that is why He did not talk to me. I failed to recognise Him, so he also did not recognise me. I asked his introduction, he also asked my introduction then. This is all the result of my diplomacy, I am guilty, contemplating in this way, tears streamed forth from his eyes. He began to lay down on the feet of the Lord. Lifting him up, the Lord embraced him to his bosom.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman said—‘My Lord! I am a beast, a very common being. It may be possible for me to forget you and to commit any great blunder before you, but how did you forget me? I have been waiting for you since long, staying here with Sugriv, obeying your order.’ Even Sugriv is in a great affliction. I have kept him solaced referring your introduction to him. You only, are his sole resort. Now, accept him reaching there and having removed the dark clouds of his calamities, avail his services? Being puffed up with joy, Hanuman got both the brothers seated on his shoulders and took them to Sugriv.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The friendship between Ram and Sugriv was established. Installing fire as a witness they established friendship-relation. Bali was killed and Sugriv became the king of monkeys. During the four months of rainy seasons, Lord Ram and Lakshman were residing on the Pravarshana hill. Indulging in sense pleasures, Sugriv forgot Ram’s cause. But how could Hanuman forget it? Several times he tried to set his mind right, but Sugriv paid no heed. He indulged in sensuality. When Lakshman marked Sugriv is neglecting, he got infuriated. Till now, Tara was propitiating him, in the meantime, a large troop of monkeys and bears, called in by Hanuman, occured to reach. Lakshman got pleased with Sugriv to see this endeavour. Sugriv came to Lord Ram and begged pardon for his deliquency. After discussing and describing the national and international regions to be traced, Sugriv began to send the monkeys-troops in search of Sita. At least this was known about Sita that Ravan had taken away towards the Southern direction, but the motive behind sending the monkeys to all the directions was to unite and gather more monkeys and if Ravan had kept Sita anywhere else, then her whereabouts would also be found out. Sugriv commanded, one who returns without having found out the definite places within a month, will have to face the severe punishment. All went to their respective directions.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To search out in the Southern direction was an uphill task. Hence, the distinctive gallant monkeys were deputed there. Jamavant, Hanuman, Angad, Nal, Nil etc., were called and admonished the gravity of the affair. In his mind, there was created confidence at that time that these braves would put through their work successfully at any cost and specially for Hanuman, nothing was impossible. He said affectionately and with great love clearly—‘Hanuman! You have the same speed in the water, on the plain and in the sky, everywhere. There is none in the space or heaven who may interrupt your speed. Just like your father, you are integrated with speed, force, glow and swiftness. You do know everything, nothing more lies to be explained to you. Your job does not end only to come back having watched the place merely, but your responsibility lies in finding out Sita also. I have full confidence in you that you will come back only after finding out Sita.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Listening to Sugriv, Lord Ram called Hanuman. Lord Ram did know it beforehand, but the version of Sugriv sharpened his memory. He said to Hanuman—‘Hanuman! I am sure, you will be successful in fulfilling my objective. Take this my ring, seeing it, Sita will believe in your identity that you are the messenger sent by Ram.’ He gave his message also to deliver it to Sita. Having touched His feet, Hanuman and others set out from there.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman, Jambavan, Angad etc., got tired of searching out. They became oppressed with appetite and thirst. There was no trace of water, they did not get any view of fruits for a number of days. The entire responsibility came upon Hanuman. Having climbed on the peak of the terrible mountain, he saw, some greenary very near. Some beautiful birds, sprinkling water with their wings came to his sight. It was an assumption in the mind that there might exist any beautiful garden and pond. He moved towards it along with all. After approaching there, they came to know that it was a cave through which they were passing out. Holding the hands of each other and repeating the name of Lord Sri Ram, they entered the cave. It was really a wonderful attractive cave. There was nectarial water in the fountains. There were the trees like gold and on the trees very delicious fruits laden. Seeking permission from the female ascetic there, all appeased their hunger and thirst and recovered their vitality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the query of the female ascetic, Hanumanji related the entire story and expressed his will that it would be better if they should go out of it as soon as possible. The female ascetic said—‘Brother! After reaching here none returns back safely alive. This is the place to practise penance without any interruption, if the people go on returning from here, the penance may be interrupted. But since you have made me hear the story of Lord Ram; so by the power of penance, I am taking you out from here. I, too, have to go to the Pravarsn hill to have vision of Lord Ram. Well, now all of you, close your eyes.’ The monkeys and the bears closed their eyes with their palms. Only after a moment they saw that they were standing on a high mountain beside the sea-shore. Seeking permission from Hanuman, the female ascetic went away to have the vision of Lord Ram.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Angad said—‘Brother! Now, one month passed but neither we could find out any trace of Janaki, nor could we approach the places where we had to reach as directed. Now, on reaching back, Sugriv is sure to kill me. Hence, staying here, I will practise penance. Please, all of you go away.’ Hanuman said—‘Prince! Why are you losing courage untimely? Sugriv is very much affectionate to you. You have been making your best efforts whole-heartedly to get the Lord Ram’s objective achieved. It is because of entering the cave we are late. He will definitely pardon us and make you the king. Don’t be worried. Lord Ram is very kind-hearted, He will always protect you. Let us make our efforts to the best of our capacities to implement His order. If you are envious to Sugriv, if you are restless on account of his becoming the king and you want to escape yourself staying here, it is impossible at all. Having shirked from Ram’s affair, it may be you hide yourself anywhere, but you cannot escape yourself from the arrows of Lakshman. When it is certain that you cannot escap yourself without completing his affair, it is then, better to go to Him, whatever He instructs, it will be done so accordingly.’ After hearing these words of Hanuman, Angad did give up his resolve to remain alive; but instead of going back to Sugriv, he considered it better to give up his life by remaining on fast there. All began to keep on fast following Angad. The talks about Ram started.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the same moment, Sampati happened to appear there. Through him, the whereabouts of Sita was found, all the monkeys and bears gathered at the sea-shore. Now it was being discussed, that who could go across the sea. On the powerful speech of Angad, all mentioned their capacity and their inability to cross the sea. Angad, too, said—‘Any how I can cross the sea, but whether I will be able to come back, is doubtful.’ Jambavan paid him due respect by addressing him, ‘The royal Prince’ and opposed his going across. He, himself, expressed his incapacity for going across due to his old age. Hanumanji remained quiet till now. Sitting in  a corner he was listening to their different versions. Angad had got disappointed. After getting the address of Sita, the delightfulness that had spread among the monkeys, was no more visible anywhere. Addressing Angad, Jambavan said—‘Nothing is there to be disappointed. To go crossing the sea, not only the vigour but immence astuteness is also needed. For this objective Lord Shankar himself has incarnated. Now the destruction of demons is obvious.’ Glancing towards Hanuman, he said—‘Hanuman! why are you keeping quiet? It is only Ram’s cause for which you are born to fulfil. O the son of wind! Like your father, you can cross the sea in a moment. You have an exquisite talent. You are the treasure of discrimination and wisdom. Possessing such an extraordinary prowess and capacity in yourself, how are you sitting silently?’ Jambavan related the narrative of Hanuman’s birth, the god’s boons and the story of sage’s curse and reminded him that he could do whatever he liked.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman remained engrossed constantly in the memory of the Lord. He was always oblivious of himself and his prowess. Just listening to Jambavan it seemed to him that he had immense power. He realised the infinite grace of the Lord and that His entire strength was his own strengtrh. His body got enlarged and became like the Sumeru mountain. He roared and said—‘What is this sea but nothing, I can cross hundreds of seas like this with the blessing of God. If I fail to find Sita in Lanka, I will search out her in each and every corner, from the heaven to the abode of Brahma, I will bring having uprooted Trikuta mountain along with Lanka; I will kill Ravan. There is no such power that may create any hindrance in my way while performing Lord’s cause.’ Hearing the roar of Hanuman, the entire troop of monkeys began to rejoice. Jambavan said—‘Hanuman! You can do everything; but at present; there is no need to do all this. Your job at present, is only to come back having traced Sita.’ All of us will march for Lanka with Ram, the demons will be liberated with the arrows of the Lord, it will enhance the glory of Ram and all of us will rejoice.’ Just hearing the words of Jambavan, Hanuman sprang upon the peak of a very high mountain. With the blow of his feet, even the big mountain ridges and peaks began to sink being cracked. With the hurt of his tail a number of trees began to float in the sky, the flowers in bunches being detached from the branches of the trees were showering on Hanuman in such a way as if they were worshipping him. The gods made applausive shouts; the sages recited hymns containing prayers for peace, the wind asisted, and Hanuman sprang up to cross the sea. Remembering God, He assured all monkeys and told them that I am feeling great enthusiasm, happiness and so also boundless grace of Lord. I will come back very soon having completed the work; be not nervous all of you, and with the acclamation of Lord’s name he set out. Being affected by his speed many trees began to fly with him. The clouds in groups with the hard touch of his body being scattered, began to drop the cool water on his body as a tribute. The wind-born Sri Hanuman kept on going in a very swift speed through the sky-route without casting his sight to any other direction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sea thought that the forefathers of the Lord Ram, had brought my existence in this form; he had never paid their debt by doing any good to them. Lest Lord Ram may think that there may be the connivance of sea in the kidnapping of Sita; because Ravan lives under me by the way. I am the moat of his fort, if I, at this moment, welcome his messenger and if I may find out any means for his rest, probably I may be saved of this stigma. He said to Mainak—‘Mainak! give a warm welcome to Ram’s messenger.’ Mainak appeared above the sea guised in a huge form. Hanuman misunderstood it a hinderance. He was hardly going to push it into the nethermost world with the blow of his leg than disguised as human being, Mainak stood upon its peak and prayed him—‘Hanuman! you are the son of my helper wind-god. When the Lord Indra was cutting down the feathers of the mountains with his thunderbolt, it was the assistance of your father that I entered the sea and then I could save myself. I want to provide you relaxation, being relaxed from your tiredness for a while, then you may go. Lord Ram’s cause is cause of the entire world. Isn’t it? To assist His messenger is to assist the entire world. I hope, you will grant my prayer.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman gave an affectionate touch to Mainak with his own hands and said—‘Mainak! <span class="char-style-override-7">y</span>ou have a great affection for me. You are worthy of adoration like my father. I must obey your command; but at this time I am going to fulfill Ram’s cause. My mind and heart is restless for doing His work. If I halt my body to take rest, it may be possible that my heart may reach Lanka leaving the body here. At present, I cannot stay even for a moment, kindly excuse me.’ Continuing his speed Hanuman moved ahead saying this much.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The gods thought that besides prowess, Hanuman’s wisdom also had been put to test several times; but whether he has the astuteness of coming back safely from the surroundings of the demons or not, should be tested. They sent Nagamata Surasa, the daughter of Daksha, the wife of Kashyap and mother of snake to test Hanuman. She stood as barrier on the way of Hanuman and began to say—Fortunately, I have got my food today by chance, I will eat up to the full of my appetite. First, Hanuman said only this much—‘I am busy in Ram’s cause. Let me fulfill it first, then, you may eat me up. I am not the least afraid of death.’ But when she rejected his request, then, Hanumant asked her to open her mouth and expand it. As much she expanded her mouth, Hanuman enlarged his body just double to it. When she made her mouth of one thousand Kilometres (one hundred yojana), assuming a very small form, he entered her mouth and came out then. Seeing the sharp wit of Hanuman, Surasa was very much pleased and having blessed him for success, she bade him farewell.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mother of Rahu, Singhika lived there in the sea. When the shadow of the being flying over the sea, fell upon the water, she caught the shadow and the flyer, being compelled, fell down into the sea-water. Thus, she had caused many ruins. With Hanuman too, she played the same trick. Feeling his own speed to be checked, Hanuman cast his look downward, and recognised the she-demon. Well, How Could she resist Hanuman? A light blow put an end to her life and Hanuman without any obstacle, reached the next shore across the sea. There was a beautiful orchard. Green trees, fragrant flowers, the chirping of birds and the humming sound of black bees were forcibly attracting the mind. But Hanuman did not take even notice of them. He jumped upon a high hillock of the mountain. He made up his mind to set the camp there as it was a very suitable place. There is sufficient fruits-roots, availibility of water for the monkeys and the most favourable thing was that the whole Lanka was clearly visible from there. Hanuman got himself acquainted with many things about Lanka. Presuming the inaccessibility of the fort, he decided to know inch by inch about it. It is also my duty to fulfil this task, besides searching out Sita.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was impossible to enter the city of Lanka with such a huge body and to mark minutely everything there; So by the use of Anima Siddhi (accomplishent of the occult powers of a Yogi), he turned himself into a small one and invoking the name of the Lord, he reached the gate of Lanka. The presiding goddess of Lanka city—Lankini, noticed him hiding himself entering in the evening. She got greatly suspicious. Approaching Hanuman she reprimanded him—‘Do you want to commit theft?’ Hanuman gave a light blow of the fist on her back and she fell down on the ground with a bang, spitting out blood. Recovering herself, she said—‘Go, I have recognised you.’ The Lord Brahma had foretold me earlier that—‘When, by the assault of monkey, your condition becomes so, then be assured that the end of Ravan is nearing him.’ Hanuman went inside. Having taken enterance in Lanka, he observed the mode of living and bedrooms etc., of the demons. He also watched their armoury, council-house, cantonment etc. He explored from corner to corner in the gynaeceum of the king of demons, Ravan. He saw Mandodari etc., women also; but no trace of Sita was found. He got worried. He felt disgusted to himself. ‘He began to argue to himself lest he might have transgressed the morality. It is against the morality to see the woman other than his own wife. I had not committed such a sin till now. Today it was a great transgression done by me.’ He fell into a great perplexedness. Just, the next moment, another thought came to his mind. By then, it was the remembering of Lord Ram that removed his worry and his mind had become placid and he had reached a conclusion. He thought—‘No doubt, I did see the other women, but didn’t glance with an evil eye. I glanced at them because of its being necessary and there was no evil motive at all and I have not the least morbid feeling in the mind. The virtuous and vicious conduct depends on our mind and my mind is well in order. Where could I search out Sita? The woman cannot be searched among the she-dears, but she was to be searched out among the women only. I have searched out with a pure mind only, so I am not at fault at all. Hanuman tried to search out at other places also. On going ahead, he saw a small cottage. In that cottage, name of Ram was inscribed at various places which were visible clearly even in the night in the shining light of the jewels. In the small beds the basil plants, saffron and fragrant flowers had been planted. In front of that holy cottage there was a small temple of the Lord and there were the paintings of the weapons of Lord. Hanuman was amazed to see such an improbable place in Lanka. He was delighted, too.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was early in the morning. Having got up, Vibhishan had begun to mutter ‘Ram-Ram’. Hanuman became confident that he was some saint undoubtedly. He determined to meet him. Disguised in the form of a <span class="char-style-override-7">b</span>rahmin, Hanuman sounded ‘Ram-Ram’. Vibhishan, at once, came out. Both the devotees of the Lord embraced each other. The both were obsessed with love and joy. Apparently, the Lord was being viewed in the heart of Vibhishan to Hanuman and Vibhishan was considering Hanuman as if the Lord incarnate. The both got acquainted with each other. Hanuman had nothing to say about his ownself but to say everything about the Lord. He mentioned the cause of his coming there by narrating the virtuous and holy character of the Lord and the story of Sita’s kidnapping. Vibhishan said—Dear Hanuman! I live here so carefully and in the difficult situations just like the poor tongue in the midst of teeth. Will the Lord ever own me, even such a helpless one? Endowed as I am with demoniac form. No Sadhana is possible by me, My heart cherishes no love for Lord’s feet. How should I hope that I will meet the Lord? But meeting to you, now I am confident in my mind that one can never meet a saint without Sri Ram’s grace. It is only His kind grace that you have visited my cottage. Certainly, the visit of a saint is the indication of the Lord’s attainment. Hanuman said—‘Vibhishan! Our Lord is a very kind-hearted always He has been showering His bliss on the poors and downtrodden. You do talk of yourself. As regards myself, of which noble family do I belong to? Merely a monkey, naughty and without any Sadhana! To do good to others is far away from me, If anyone utters even my name in the morning, he remains deprived of meal for the whole day. Friend Vibhishan! I am such a mean, even then, the Lord has favoured me with His kindness. Those who, even after knowing His greatness, don’t repeat His name, keep on going astray, how would they not remain always distressed?’ By recollecting the virtues of Lord Ram, Hanuman’s heart was filled with joy. His eyes were filled with the tears of love. There was a good deal of discussion between Vibhishan and Hanuman. On the basis of the clue given by Vibhishan, Hanuman went to Asoka Vana.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mother Sita was sitting under the Ashok tree. Her body had became emaciated, the sign of her wifehood was mere a braid, her hair had become matted. She remained always absorbed in muttering the Lord’s name and she was dwelling on the Lord’s frolicsome activities and His merits in her mind. From a distance, Hanuman mentally saluted her and climbed upon a tree and sat on it. Ravan came and tried to coax Sita; then, threatened; but returned back being influenced by her firmness, her sanctity, her concentrated devotion to Ram and her chastity. A number of she-demons began to persuade Sita to be favourable to Ravan. These activities caused great pain to Sita. Due to not getting any trace of Ram, she apprehended some misfortune to Ram, it seemed that she would not like to be alive. Relating the narrative of her dream, Trijata began to console and soothe her and many of the she-demons went away from there. Trijata, too, went away after sometime.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing Sita terribly agonised, Hanuman related different topics from Ram’s birth, his marriage, banishment to the forest, kidnapping of Sita etc., from beginning, sitting on the tree and at last disclosed that he had come there as messenger sent by Him. Sita felt greatly solaced hearing these nectarial words of Hanuman, but just the next moment her heart got shivered also with another suspicion. She thought lest it should be the demoniac illusion. Hanuman smelt the inner feeling of Sita. He said—‘Mother! I quoth on oath of the compassionate Lord Ram’s feet that I am the attendant of Ram. He has disclosed an internal secret to me to take you in faith. When you were in the forest with Him, and Jayant had attacked on you, disguising himself in the form of a crow, the Lord had used the arrow (Ishikastra) and he got no shelter anywhere in all the three worlds. Your ring which you had given Him to give to the boatman (Kewat) and which Lord Ram had put on in his own finger, has been given to me by Him evidently for you to believe in me. Hence, believe me, I touch your feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Really, Hanuman’s heart was guileless and he gave the genuine proof also. So, Sita got confident and believed in him, she called Hanuman to come down and was in rapture having the ring with her. She felt so much delighted to receive the message of Lord Ram, as if she had got her dear and beloved Ram himself in person. She said to Hanuman—‘Hanuman! <span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>oday, you have done a great good to me. Now; how much grieved would have He felt if He had heard about my death when thinking that Ram had forgotten me or any harm had been assailed to Him, I had died?’ He would have felt agonised due to me. Hanuman! Does He ever remember me? Will it be possible for me to view Him ever? Will He immediately rescue me? While expressing her inner feelings, being too much emotional, her voice was choked, tears came in her eyes, she could not utter a word. Hanuman said—‘Mother! Why are you getting so much distressed? It is difficult for me to describe in words, how much is Ram restless for your sake? Casting His glance at the earth He says—‘Mother earth! Your dear daughter has suffered much due to me. Are you annoyed due to this that you are not providing the way to inter you to me?’ He happens to say to see the blossoming flowers and buds—‘Lakshman! Pluck them; I will entwine them to the hair of Sita.’ Mother! His separation-agony is beyond description. He always remembers you and forgets Himself.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman again said—Mother! Addressing you, He has said—‘Beloved! In your presence all those objects, which were used to delight me, are proving to be painful today. The beautiful sprouting leaves of the trees seem to be burning fire to me. The moon is scorching like the mid-day sun of the summer and the small rain drops which were like nectar earlier, seem to be burning oil. Cool and fragrant breezing air are now causing me pain like breath of the poisonous snakes. If I could express my this flurry and mental agony before anybody, I could feel in my heart a bit relief and relaxed! But what and whom to express! Who is there to realise and understand this mental and inner state of mine? It is only my spirit that knows the secret of our mutual love and the union of each other’s spiritual souls and my soul and my heart remain always with you and never get detached even for a moment. It never separates from you.* But is it only sufficient to explain my extreme love which is beyond description? I will insist to say, not at all, never; but what more can be uttered?’</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold">................................॥</p>
<p class="Footnotes">The essence of love between you and me is known only to my heart and that my heart is with you always.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While relating this, Hanuman had gone very emotional. It appeared to Sita that it was Ram, Himself, speaking this apparently standing before her. She got absorbed in love and became oblivious of her own being. Solacing Sita, Hanuman said—‘Mother! Look towards the power, glory and prowess of the Lord. These mean and worthless demons cannot stay even for a moment against His arrows. Think that they are dead. The Lord did not have your trace otherwise he would have taken you away long before, having massacred the demons. All of us, the monkeys and bears will come with Him and kill the demons, knocking them down repeatedly and rejoicing, we will take you back to Ayodhya.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Mother! Have you forgotten the power of the Lord? Just as it comes to His notice, He will start at once with His soldiers from there, He will turn the sea motionless with His arrows and no demon will survive in Lanka. He will remove all the obstacles of His way, even if the gods, devils and the Yam (death) himself prove to create any hinderance, He will put an end to all. Mother! I say on oath that with your separation the Lord Ram is so much afflicted that it is beyond description. He will not delay a moment even. You, yourself, will see Him safe and well very soon. Sita said—Hanuman! Till now ten months have passed, only two months are left, if in such a short duration, the Lord did not rescue me, I would be deprived of His vision. I am still alive only to have His vision. If Vibhishan had not saved me with his humble prayer, Ravan would have killed me by now. While sharing her worry to Hanuman, Sita got perplexed, her voice choked, she could speak no more.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman said—‘Mother! I did say to you that the Lord would start at once just hearing my words. But what is the need for Him to come? It is today, I just cause you to get rid of this grief. Get yourself seated on my back, I will cross the sea with you sitting on my back. Just as fire carries away the oblations to the Lord Indra in no time, like the same, I just carry you away to the Lord Ram, seated on the Pravarshan hill at once. By the grace of God, it is not only you but I can carry on even Ravan along with his entire Lanka. Now, don’t delay, when I carry you away, no demon can follow me.’ Sita was overjoyed to hear the words of Hanuman. She said—‘Hanuman! Your body is very small, how are you daring to take me away?’ Hanuman revealed his large wrathful form to Sita. He enlarged himself as Sumeru mountain. He said to Sita—‘Goddess! Now, don’t delay. If you order, let me take away the whole Lanka having massacred all the demons. Make up your mind and reaching there make Ram and Lakshman happy.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janaki said—‘Hanuman! I have become well acquainted with your power and your prowess. Your splendour shines like wind and fire. You can take me away but it is not proper for me to go with you. I may faint because of your swift speed. I may fall down from your back. You will have to fight a terrible battle against the demons and you will have to face great hardships. As regards battle, God knows who will win, you or the demons. You can win even; but the glory will not go to the Lord in this way. My going this way people will think, whom Hanuman is taking away seated on his back. It may be for a moment only but it may create a sense of suspicion about my character in their mind.’ Showing some more reasons, Sita said—‘Due to my devotion to husband I cannot touch your body willingly. Ravan had touched my body, it was forcible, I was helpless, I could not prevent it?* I will go with Ram when He comes here and kills Ravan along with the demons and it will be deserving for Him.’ Hanuman paid due regard to the assertions of Sita. He praised her. Sita said—‘Son! Seeing your dedication and devotion, your faith in the Lord, and your prowess and manhood, I feel greatly contented. I bless you—‘May you be valiant, urbane, immortal and ever young! May God always bestow His love upon you!’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman got horripilated hearing—‘May God always bless you with His love!’ What more was required to him? This is the supreme attainment of life. He expressed his gratefulness to Sita stating the blessings of the mother infallible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After getting the vision of the mother, Hanuman thought that the battle between Sri Ram and Ravan was to be sure, but the fort was so strong, the forewalls were so protected and such unique instruments were fitted at its doors that it was not easy to win. Without breaking them, the way to our attack could not be opened. But how to break them, is a question before us. Well! I am evidently a monkey. I can pluck and eat the fruits, because now, the Lord’s object has been fulfilled. I can break some branches and leaves of the trees, because it is the only way to incite these wickeds. Hanuman determined it and being confirmed of his wit and prowess, the mother, too, granted him permission.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Several trees of the garden were uprooted and destroyed. The gardeners were compelled to run away. Thousands of demons were razed to dust. By single blow Akshaya Kumar was thrashed thoroughly and his bones were broken to pieces. Terror was caused in entire Lanka. First, Ravan himself, was coming to fight, but Meghnad checked him. He came upon, by the assaults of Hanuman his life was at stake. Being bewildered he used ‘Brahmapash’. Though by virtue of the boon granted by the Brahma, Hanuman was free from the ‘Brahmapash’ yet he thought not to violate the propriety of ‘Brahmapash’ and going to the assembly of Ravan he should narrate the glory of the Lord so that the demons might be frightened. He, himself, got bound by the ‘Brahmapash’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Meghanad took him to the royal assembly cheerfully. Upto reaching there, the bondage being loose, had detached from his body. Hanuman saw that in the royal assembly of Ravan, there were eminent gods, lokapals and the guardian deities of the ten regions of the world standing with folded hands. The sun-shine is mild, the wind-god is fanning and fire-god is waiting for the command. All are waiting for the hint of Ravan. Hanuman was standing fearlessly. Seeing him, such impolite, it is not known that thinking what, Ravan burst into laughter; but just the next moment, he remembered his son Akshay Kumar, already killed by Hanuman. He asked scoldingly ‘Who are you, on whose strength you have created such a havoc? Do you not know me? Just now I would teach you a lesson.’ Hanuman said in a very grave voice—‘Ravan! I am the messenger of that Lord Ram, who is the shelter of the entire nature, in His cap-a-pie crores of universes are created and ruined every moment, with His power, Brahma, Visn<span class="char-style-override-12">h</span>u, Mahesh—are busy in doing their duties, by His grace ‘Sheshanag’ is capable of holding the earth, and He has incarnated to punish the demons like you. Don’t you know Him? At the time of the bow-ceremony in Janaka’s court, the bow which could not be moved from its place by you, was broken like a straw by the Lord, have you forgotten Him? Don’t you know that One who all alone had massacred Khar, Dushan and Trishira along with fourteen thousand soldiers? Don’t you know the Lord, who killed Bali with one arrow, who kept you pressing under his armpit? Ravan! You can forget Him but He cannot forget you. You cannot escape yourself from the Lord in spite of forgetting Him, in whose absence, having disguised yourself and through deception, you have abducted His wife. I am the messenger of that Lord. Recognise me well. There is no delay now, by His arrows your Lanka will be deserted, and your these royal members will have no trace.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the bold speech of Hanuman, the demons began to tremble. They got frightened by their mind that as a result, they could not face Ram bravely in the battle field. The gods got delighted to themselves. Ravan disregarded Hanuman’s words. Hanuman said again—‘I have not committed any guilt if I have eaten fruits to appease my appetite. It is but my wont to break the trees and leaves. I have also assaulted the wicked to protect my life who have tried to kill me. It was the high handedness of your son, who have tried to captivate me, but I forgive them. Listen to me my single advice, and accept it. This my suggestion is in your favour. I say with love, humility and say in your interest from the core and corner of my heart truthfully, Brother Ravan! <span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>ime (spirit) does not spare anyone. It swallows the whole world but remains afraid of Him and remains under His control. Creating enmity with Him, you cannot escape yourself. Take Janaki and handover her; the Lord will forgive your guilt and forgive you. The Lord is very kind-hearted. He forgets all the guilts who takes refuge in Him and if he surrenders himself to Him. Concentrate your mind to his feet and enjoy uninterrupted sovereignty of Lanka. You belong to a high descent, you have wealth beyond the limit, you are a great learned person, and you have power more than enough, don’t be proud of your all these possessions, it is an ephemeral glory. Well! take the shelter under the Lord. I speak truthfully, I speak by oath that none can protect you if you go against Ram!’ So,—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘The net of Maya is thorny, better give up your vanity. Always repeat the name of Ram who is the ocean of grace.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Although, Hanuman gave very beneficial sermons, but they did not find favour with Ravan. Being irritated, Ravan ordered the demons to kill him. Vibhishan made an objection that it is quite unjust to kill the messenger. At last, it was decided to mutilate the parts of his body and Ravan ordered to burn his tail to ashes. The clothes began to be rolled around his tail. It was made wet with oil and fire was set to it. About ten to twenty demons took him around the city holding him under control, Hanuman considered it the most suitable time to ruin Lanka. The children began to laugh clapping their hands in approbation. He gave a blow with his tail and all the demons ran away to save their lives. Springing upon from one palace to another, he began to burn to ashes all the palaces. The wind helped him. The fire shared in the activity of his friend wind’s son, Lanka began to burn with flames rising high. Most of the instruments were ruined. The places to keep one in delusion were burnt to ashes. But the Lanka of gold was yet safe. Though in the whole city there was the cry of distress, all including their children, wives and old ones with their belonging, were running away to different directions, yet Lanka was shining even at the time of being burnt.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that in a dungeon of Lanka the god Shanaishchara Dev was kept confined. By the touch of Hanuman’s feet its round wall dashed down. After enquiry, Shanaishchar came to know everything from Hanuman and saw towards Lanka with leer. Except the Vibhishan’s house, the entire Lanka was burnt to ashes. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He showered boon on Hanuman and told that ruin of Lanka is very near and went away. Having released Sanaishchar Dev when Hanuman saw that entire Lanka is ruined, sensing no danger at all in rough and rugged path, he jumped in the sea and having bathed, came to Sita. Mother Sita gave a crest-jewel for the Lord and asked to pray for her deliverance as soon as possible. Having saluted her with due regard, Hanuman set out on his journey with a great roar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Jambavan, Angad etc., were waiting for Hanuman without eating and drinking standing on single foot. All presumed of his success just hearing his sound of joy and moving ahead, they embraced him. Eating and drinking and making Madhuvan deserted, all reached to the Lord Ram. Hanuman described in a great pathetic way the conditions of Sita. He told Ram about the prosperity of Lanka, the power and pelf of Ravan and gave Him each and every information. The Lord said—‘Hanuman! <span class="char-style-override-7">t</span>here is none so beneficent as you in the world. What should I give you in return? I am indebted to you, I am unable to see you face to face.’ Just hearing these words of the Lord, Hanuman, being restless, fell down on His feet and got overwhelmed with love. Having lifted him, the Lord Ram embraced him to His bosom and blessed him for his one pointed devotion. Lord Shankar’s desire was fulfilled, for which He had become Hanuman. The work was accomplished.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">This is the distinctive characteristic of Hanuman’s character that whosoever came in his contact, he got him reach in the contact of the Lord by some or other way. Vibhishan met him in Lanka, he was so much impressed by his contact and conversation that he favoured Hanuman in the open court assembly of Ravan and at last, he came in the shelter of Ram giving up Ravan. At the time when, the Lord declared his resolve to protect the refugee coming to His shelter inspite of Sugriv’s oppositions then, how much delighted he (Hanuman) was, is beyond description. Taking Angad with him, Hanuman sprang with a great zeal and went to Vibhishan first of all and led him to Lord Ram. His single and sole work is the Lord’s service and help to those who long on to surrender in the shelter of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ocean was bridged, the number of the hills Hanuman brought, cannot be counted. Even after the bridge was completed, he was coming with a mountain from north border. After going away some distance from Indraprasth, he came to know that the work of the bridge construction had been completed. He thought that there was no use of the mountain and so he put it there but that mountain was also not a common mountain. Its spirit having appeared, said to Hanuman—‘O outstanding devotee! What crime have I done that I am being deprived of the Lord-service, even after getting the touch of your lotus-hands? Don’t leave me here, put me in the feet of the Lord carrying me there, if there is no place on the earth, sink me into the sea, if I am not able to contribute my services to the Lord, it is not proper for me to remain alive then, what is the use of this life?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman said—‘O the king of mountain! You are worthy of being the best of mountains. Seeing your such a dedicated loyalty, I think to myself to carry you there; but it has been announced from the Lord side now not to bring any mountain. I am helpless. But I will pray to the Lord for your sake. I will convey it to you whatever His reaction and command is.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman went to the Lord. He expressed his prayer and truthfulness before the Lord. The Lord said—‘This mountain is quite dear to Me. You have provided him salvation. Go and tell him that I will engage him in my work having incarnated in the form of ‘Krishna’ in Dwapar age and lifting him on my finger for seven days I will protect the inhabitants of Vraja. Reaching Vrajabhumi, Hanuman conveyed the message of the Lord to Govardhan. By the grace of Hanuman, the mountain Govardhan became a great favourite to the Lord. He became the retinue of the frolicsome activities of the Lord.</p>

His head was in the lap of Sugriv; Angad and Hanuman were massaging his feet, His bow and quiver were kept side by side, Lakshman was watching the Lord sitting behind in the heroic posture, the Lord was titillating the arrow having it in his hands. Looking towards the moon the Lord asked—‘Brother! Tell me all of you applying your wit separately, how is this swarthiness in the moon?’ Sugriv, Vibhishan, Angad etc., explained its reason according to their feelings. In the last, Hanuman said—“My Lord! The moon is your attendant. It is you, whom he has offered his whole-hearted love. He always keeps you in his heart and you, too, live in his heart. It is enough; it is you visible in his heart in the form of Shyamasundar.” The Lord began to laugh, all were much delighted.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कह हनुमंत सुनहु प्रभु ससि तुम्हार प्रिय दास।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तव मूरति बिधु उर बसति, सोइ स्यामता अभास॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman got the vision of the Lord everywhere. What  is strange if he got the vision of the Lord in the moon?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Fierce battle was fought between Ram and Ravan. It is not hidden to the lovers of the Ramyan how many demons were slaughtered by Hanuman. From time to time he assisted Ram, Lakshman, Vibhishan, Jambavan all in the battle. While fighting with Meghanad, Lakshman was hurt with dreaded blow of Shaktivan, He fainted in the battle-field. Meghanad himself and his many soldiers brave like him, tried jointly to lift and take away Lakshman but they were not successful, they could not lift up Lakshman from the ground. Hanuman lifted him up very easily and brought him to Ram. Ram got shocked and grieved much to see Lakshman in the unconscious condition. Jambavan stated that in Lanka there lives an Ayurvedic Physician, named Sushena. If he could come right at this moment, Lakshman can be cured.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman started for Lanka at once. He thought that the Ayurvedic physician belonged to the enemy side, he might not come in the night probably, hence, why not to uproot his residential house and he did so. Having come amidst the Ram’s army, Susen attended Lakshman and advised that if the medicinal herbs available at the Dronachal mountain are brought before the sun-rise, Lakshman can be brought back to the life. Remembering the Lord, Hanuman set out for Dronachal. This news had already reached the ears of Ravan. In connivance with the demon Kalanemi, Ravan made such a trap of conspiracy as Hanuman’s most of the time might be wasted on the way and he might not come back there before sun-rise the next day. Disguised in the appearance of a sage, Kalanemi tried to keep Hanuman in illusion; but whose mirage could act upon the messenger of the controller of divine potency? By providence, Hanuman came to know the conspiracy and having given the death, as the Guru-dakshina of the spiritual guide to the illusory great sage, moved ahead.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman reached Dronachal. It was night. He could not recognise the herbs of medicine. Probably, the medical herb hid themselves. The word ‘delay’ was not in the dictionary of Hanuman; during the night he had to reach Lanka. He uprooted the entire Dronachal and set out to return. While coming, Ayodhya came to exist on his way. Seeing from a distance, Bharat presumed him to be any demon. He shot an arrow lightly. Just being shot, Hanuman fell down being fainted chanting—‘Ram-Ram’. Hearing the words ‘Ram-Ram’ from his mouth, Bharat rushed up to him and began to awake him making his best efforts. At last, he said—‘If I am a true devotee of Ram, this monkey must revive back to life at once.’ Hanuman became conscious and sat down. Hanuman related the entire story. Repenting greatly, Bharat condemned himself and asked Hanuman to make his journey being seated on his arrow. Hanuman rejected the offer very humbly and he reached Lanka carrying Dronachala. At that moment Ram was quite restless. Just after arrival of Hanuman, He embraced him to His bosom. Susena treated and Lakshman regained his health. Hanuman’s glory began to be related all around. Hanuman placed Susena and his house at its original place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was night. Hanuman was guarding. Ahiravan in the guise of Vibhishan came there. Hanuman called him and asked, ‘Brother! Where are you coming from at such a dead of night?’ He said—‘By the order of the Lord, I had gone to offer evening prayer, I got late in the return, He has called me immediately.’ All having gone asleep, Ahiravan happened to run away getting seated Ram and Lakshman on his shoulders. Is there anybody capable to kidnap the Lord? Lakshman never slept; when the God decides to highlight the glory of His devotee then He sports like a common man. Today, He had to spread the fame of Hanuman, He willingly made it possible for Ahiravan to carry Him on his shoulders.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next morning, the uproar was created among the whole of army. Sugriv, Jambavan, Vibhishan and all were perplexed and in a fix. Hanuman brought that event in their notice. Vibhishan said—‘It is the trick of Ahiravan, none else can disguise himself in my form.’ Hanuman said—‘He might be gallant beyond imagination, he might be residing in a secret place beyond visibility, I will reach there and having killed him, I will bring back my Lord.’ Hanuman set out on his journey. By providence, on the way, some such incidence occured, which established that Ahiravan has taken them away to the abode of serpent demons in one of the regions below the earth. Reaching there, Hanuman tried to enter the palace; but Makaradhwaj checked him. He said—‘Who are you? Don’t you know, I am the son of Mahavir Hanuman. If you like to enter secretly, it will be hard nut to crack for you.’ Hearing this, Hanuman got astonished, He said—‘Brother! I have no son at all; how and where did you come from?’ Makaradhwaj said—‘When you were taking bath in the sea after burning Lanka, a fish had drunk your perspiration. I was born of her womb.’ He asked him about the whereabouts of Ram and Lakshman. He said—‘I don’t know anything more but only this much is in my knowledge that my master is offering someone’s sacrifice. Nobody is permitted to go there. I will not allow you even.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">They fought, one better than the other, The greater son of the great father! At last, Hanuman tied him with his own tail and entered the temple with the touch of his feet only, the goddess sank into the ground and he stood at the place of the goddess, having spread out his mouth. The demons misunderstood that the goddess has appeared before them, being pleased. They worshipped more and more. The goddess of the day began to place in her mouth whatever the fruits, the garlands, grains, clothes etc., came. At the time of oblation, Ram and Lakshman were brought. In that duration, the demons mocked at them and teased them in different ways. They went on tolerating silently, did not make even the least protest. Ahiravan said—‘Now, all of you remember your protector!’ Smiling, the Lord said—‘Do care, lest your goddess should not swallow  up you all.’ He was hardly about to use his sword when Hanuman reached the Lord with a loud roar and having got them seated on both of his shoulders, he snatched away the sword from the hands of Ahiravan. Having massacred Ahiravan and other demon. Hanuman brought the Lord to the camp. All began to rejoice amidst the loud shout of merriment all around. All the directions were echoed with the applausive shouts of ‘Hanuman’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman remained engaged all along in Ram’s affair. Even now, he continues the same, but it relates to the battle time. Throughout the day, sometimes close to the Lord and sometimes away from Him, he used to fight war and in the night he massaged His feet. He used to hear His sermons on religion, knowledge and love. Not only sometimes but often, the Lord titillated His lotus palms on his body and his entire fatigue disappeared. When the Lord Ram used to get asleep, he used to sit at the gate by making the four walls of long baboon and kept watch throughout the night and again in the morning to fight in the battle field. If any uphill task was to be done, Jambavan, Sugriv, Angad—all took the shelter of Hanuman.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While fighting war against Ravan, Hanuman gave such a fist blow to Ravan that he fainted. Coming to consciousness, he praised Hanuman highly and accepted that he had never faced such a brave throughout his life. It was so as Lakshman had got fainted by the assault of Ravan. Like his son, Meghanad, Ravan also had thought to lift him away. He exercised his full power but he could not lift Lakshman. Seeing this, Hanuman ran there, inspite of his entire body having been pierced by the arrows of Ravan, he reached Lakshman’s close and gave a fist blow at Ravan. He brought Lakshman near Ram delicately like a flower. Clasping Hanuman to His bosom Ram said—‘Brother! You are the terror of terrible Yam. You have incarnated to protect the gods, then what does the faint mean for you?’ Just hearing the words of Ram, Lakshman sat up and went to the battle field again with the double enthusiasm. It was the true courage of Hanuman that such a calamity was averted in a moment.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ram was victorious. Now, who should go to Sita and convey her the message of victory? The Lord called Hanuman and said—‘Hanuman! Sita is too much affectionate towards you. It is only you to go there to convey her the message of victory. Enter Lanka only after seeking permission from Vibhishan and then, speak to Sita about the well-being of myself, Sugriv and Lakshman and tell her about the slaying of Ravan also.’ Hanuman entered Lanka. The demons of Lanka welcomed him warmly. The permission of Vibhishan was already in hand ! He reached close to Sita who was sitting under the Ashok tree in the ‘Ashok Vana’. After making reverential prostration to the feet of Sita, he related the entire event. Sita could speak nothing for a moment, she was overjoyed with emotion. Tears streamed forth from her eyes. Sita said—‘Son! I could speak nothing hearing such an exhilarating news. Don’t take it otherwise. Nothing can be more exhilarating than this good news for me. I am in a fix what to offer you in return. It is so because there is a tradition to bestow upon something to the messenger who relates the delightful news. But if I donate you the entire property and wealth of the three worlds or the whole prosperity, even then, it will not satisfy me. May the exclusive devotion to the Lord remain continuously in your heart and may I remain indebted to you forever. May Raghunathji keep blessing on you with His bliss and grace and may you remain keeping on the virtues and merits in your mind !</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With folded hands, Hanuman said—‘Mother ! Who is the other one in the world, except you to speak so affectionately and shower upon me the grace and affection whole heartedly? I may remain with the presence of the both—you and the Lord—in my mind, memory and heart forever and I may continue my being under aegis of His lotus hands; what is left more for you to give me? Favour me to order what service should I render you?’ Sitaji said—‘I am keen extremely to have the view of the Lord. The delay of a single moment even, makes me impatient.’ Hanuman, at once, set out from there and reached the Lord. He narrated Sita’s happiness, her keeness to meet and prayer to the Lord. The Lord ordered Vibhishan—‘Bring Sita.’</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Ram, with Sita, Lakshman, Sugriv, Vibhishan etc., returned Ayodhya by ‘Pushpak Viman’. At Prayag, He called Hanuman and said—‘Hanuman! Having visited Ayodhya, watch what is Bharat doing? In my separation he must be experiencing a moment like a decade. Convey him my news and come back to me with his information.’ Hanuman set out.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">None can imagine even how impatient Bharat was in Ayodhya for the Lord! Hanuman realised his condition, he was sitting on a mat of holy grass. There was the crown of the matted hair on his head, His body had reduced to a skeleton. Tears were flowing from his eyes and the chanting of ‘Ram-Ram’ was being made through his mouth without any break. He was so mentally absorbed that he did not even know that someone had come there. Interrupting his concentration, Hanuman, himself said—‘The same Lord Ram, whose separation has made you to lament so much, whose name and virtues are being muttered by you day and night, who is the protector of gods and sages, is arriving here safely along with mother Janaki and Lakshman.’ Bharat had hardly heard the words of Hanuman, than he felt transmission of new life in his body. Nectar overflowed over his whole body. Abruptly he stood up and clung Hanuman to his bosom. After knowing his acquaintance, his joy had no bound. He asked about Ram again and again and Hanuman, too, related again and again. Both were feeling infinite joy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bharat said—‘Brother! What should I give you, what is that worthy to give in return? To remain indebted to you is merely the source of pleasure for me.’ Hanuman bowed to his feet and praising his love very much, he said—‘The Lord Ram often keeps on talking about you. He narrates your virtues. He always repeats your name.’ Seeking permission from Bharat, Hanuman departed from there.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord was coronated. Gifts were distributed to all, the Lord, Himself, with his own hands bestowed valuable gems, diamonds, clothes, ornaments etc., to Sugriv, Vibhishan etc., But thinking something else, He gave nothing to Hanuman. All the assembly members were thinking to themselves why the Lord forgot Hanuman. The Lord kept quiet deliberately. The mother Sita was knowing the secret of the Lord’s frolicsome activity, but to impress the glory of Hanuman on others. She displayed another frolicesome activity. Having put off the diamond necklaces of Her own neck, she dressed up Hanuman. All began to praise the mother. Hanuman, too, accepted it with great love. But what was this new occurence that happened? The next moment people being amazed, began to look towards Hanuman. It so happened that Hanuman took up one bead of the gem of garland and used to break it into pieces and he stared at it minutely and threw it away. This action was being done by him in continuity. It is not known how many beads he broke and threw them away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Ram was smiling. Sita had become somewhat serious also. Bharat, Lakshman and Shatrughn were watching it in amazement, but the assembly members could not control themselves. They asked—‘Hanuman! What are you doing this? Don’t mix these valuable gems in the dust.’ Somebody uttered in a restrained voice—‘After all he is a monkey. How does he know the value of gems? It is expected from him to know its value, observing the annoyance of the majority, Hanuman said—‘Brothers! Why are you getting annoyed? I am testing the importance of these gems. There is an extraordinary shining in it. These gems can be sold at very higher price. It may be for one beyond the capacity to purchase it, it may enhance the beauty also after wearing; but the question arises whether all these things only are the symbol of majesty? No, not at all. Whatever I have understood the criterion of majesty, is that, the object which provides the image of the Lord in its heart, is the only significant object. I was searching out whether God is visible in the heart of these gems or not? I didn’t notice. Its glamour seemed to me gloomy. What concern have I got to do with it? What purpose of mine will it solve? These are to be broken and given up any day later or sooner, so I broke them and gave them up.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Listening to Hanuman, most of them came to know the secret of breaking the gems, but there were a few who were yet doubtful. They asked—‘Then, is there Ram in your heart? If He is present, show us and if not, why are you burdened with the load of heart?’ Hanuman said—‘Of course, there is God in my heart—He lies just as you see Him before you.’ He tore up his heart with his both hands and showed that Lord Ram, mother Janaki with His brothers were seated on the throne in His heart. All began to acclaim the glory of Hanuman. Having left the throne, the Lord embraced Hanuman and just with the touch of His body, Hanuman’s bosom became stronger than earlier. The secret, why the Lord did not give the gift to Hanuman, was realized by everyone. The mother Sita began to smile mildly.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Son like Hanuman and mother like Sita! The depth of affection between them is beyond description. Thousands of attendants and maid-servants were there to attend Sita; Only her hint was enough to get the work done; but even then, she was not satisfied. She thought to feed her dear son Hanuman the meal prepared with her own hands. She prepared several types of dishes, Hanuman sat to eat. How sweet and tasty the dish is if prepared with the hands of the mother! Hanuman began to eat. He did not know that how much he had eaten up, the whole kitchen was about to be emptied but yet Hanuman did not desist from consuming. The mother Sita was astonished with this activity of Hanuman. Being helpless, she committed to her memory the Lord, Ram. Sitaji saw that Lord Shankar himself in the guise of Hanuman is partaking of. At the time of deluge, who swallows up the entire world, who is the great annihilator of the Yam (death) even, how such Hanuman’s stomach could be filled with some dishes. She admired Hanuman. Bound by propriety, going behind Hanuman, she wrote on his head <span class="char-style-override-13">‘ॐ नम: शिवाय’</span> and then gave viands. Now, Hanuman got fully sated. Thus, the mother Sita herself, accepted Hanuman as Lord Shankar incarnate.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was only Hanuman who attended Lord Ram in all respects. He used to be so attentive in his work that there was no opportunity for others. Bharat, Shatrughn and Lakshman even, kept on craving for some service. At last, they thought of a plan. They chalked out such a timetable of the routine work where all the services of the Lord should be classified and the work should be allotted to them accordingly. There should be no room in the time-table for Hanuman. The plan was prepared and passed unanimously. The plan was put up before the Lord Ram through mother Sita. Seeing it, the Lord smiled. Showing it to Hanuman He asked him—‘Hanuman! Give your view. Do you like this plan of work division?’ Hanuman said—‘Lord! If there is unanimous consent and recommendation of the mother too, grant it and the service that remains left unattended in this time-table, should be allotted to me.’ The Lord told to others—‘Brother! Deliberate upon well and observe minutely.’ All went through and found no service left. All complied with Hanuman’s view. This planning was approved by the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman pointed out—‘Lord! The custom of the Royal court is to snap fingers when the Lord is yawning. Hence, let this work be allotted to me.’ All considered it a very common work and the Lord also approved it smiling. Bharat got wonder-struck to mark what a subtle sense of service Hanuman had.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it was in favour of Hanuman. He began to live with Lord like shadow while moving anywhere, eating, sleeping, always. When the Lord moved for somewhere, Hanuman walked ahead having his face backward. When the Lord fell asleep, standing at a little distance, he used to look intently the moon like face of the Lord. Some or the other had raised objection even, but Hanuman silenced them saying that the Lord might yawn at anytime as it is not known. The mother Sita also began to feel inconvenience in attending the Lord. Lakshman and Shatrughn also got perplexed. The Lord Ram used to burst into laughter. Ultimately, on the request of the great queen Sita, the Lord changed the new time-table and Hanuman began to attend continually as usual like in the past.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold">••••</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bharat, Shatrughn etc., all were of the opinion and it was the fact also, that the Lord Ram used to pour down His affection the most upon Hanuman. When they had to seek any opinion from the Lord, they got it sought through Hanuman. Hanuman, himself, asked different types of questions from the Lord and the mother Sita and got the ‘Tattvik’ knowledge about embodied being (Jiva) and ‘Shiv’ etc. The Lord Ram had delivered His sermons to him on ‘Tattvik’ knowledge many times and He had explained him the whole profoundity of Vedanta. The primary contexts of the ‘Adhyatm Ramyan’ are concerning to the same. Even in the ‘Brahmandapuran’ such a fable exists that the same sermons, what Lord has imparted to Arjun and Uddhav in His Sri Krishnaa’ incarnation, have been given to Anjani born Sri Hanuman in the reincarnation as Ram (Ram Avatar). Hanuman was the embodiment of knowledge, many contexts are the documentary proof of the above statement. It does not matter for the Lord Shankar. It is Shiv Himself there lies no question to be astonished.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sometimes, seeing Hanuman too much serviceful to Himself, the Lord used to say—‘Hanuman! you are my embodiment itself, what is the need to render so much service? You always remain carefree.’ Hanuman says—‘Lord! what you say is true, but by serving you, would I not remain your embodiment? Whether don’t I remain carefree while serving you? As regards my physical form, I am your attendant. This body belongs to you always and the proper utilisation of this body is to remain always engaged in attending you and your devotees. As regards my spirit, I am your part. Hence, it is worthwishing always to remain close to you and may not  separate from you. From the ‘Tattvik’ point of view, I am your embodiment itself. From this point of view what is to say and what is to listen?* The Lord used to be very much delighted hearing such words from Hanuman.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The horse of the Lord Ram’s ‘Ashwamedh-yagya’ (Vedic Horse-sacrifice) was released. Shatrughn, Pushkal, Laksminidhi etc., renowned braves were deputed for its protection, Hanuman, too, was with them. At several places, big battles were fought, what a great earnestness Hanuman showed, how bravely he fought the battle, all these can be known only after going through ‘Patalakhand’ of Padma Puran. Here, only some of the events are exhibited as a sample.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The battle was being fought against Subahu, the king of Chakrank city. Several warriors were killed, many were wounded, the last fight was going on between Subahu and Hanuman. The blow of one leg of Hanuman was thrashed on the chest of Subahu and he fell down fainted. In the faintness Subahu saw that he was in Ayodhya. The Lord Ram was performing a ‘Yagya’ on the bank of the ‘Sarayu’ river and creator of over crores of universes Brahma etc., were praying in His adoration. The sages as Narad etc., were singing reverential song in the praise of His virtues playing on lyre and timbreld and they were singing his glory being incarnate and seeing swarthy splendour of Ram’s face. Subahu got infatuated of Hanumanji and remained lying in the same condition for a long time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When he came to consciousness after faint, his ignorance had gone away. Having related the story of seer’s curse, he sang highly the glory and fame of Hanuman and mentioned that it was the touch of Hanuman’s feet that he had got the knowledge of Ram Tattva, now stop the war and let all of you march for Ayodhya with the articles of offering. Let us engage ourselves in attending the service in the Ram’s ‘Yagya’. Having adored Hanuman etc., they came to Ayodhya and Hanuman proceeded onward with the sacrificial horse.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the horse was stopped and tied by the King Viramani of Devapura, the devotee of Lord Shiv, a fierce battle was fought. Being pleased with the devotion and worship of Viramani, it was Lord Shankar, Himself, who fought in the war and Shatrughn, Pushkal etc., all the brave warriors got fainted and became dead like. It was only Hanuman who went on fighting. It was the display of Lord Shankar that He, Himself, was fighting with His devotee and the Lord on both the sides. On both the sides it was Lord Shankar, then how was it possible for either of the two to give in? In the harsh voice Hanuman said—‘I did know that Shankar is the devotee of Lord Ram; but now we got to know your devotion. We protect the horse to get ‘Ram-Yagya’ completed successfully and you are fighting war to create obstacle.’ Shankar said—‘Brother! You are right. How is it possible for me to be a devotee of the Lord?’ But I like and appreciate your versions. At least, you reminded me of the Lord’ but what should I do? I am bound by the devotion of Viramni. I am compelled to fight from his side.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Fierce battle was fought. With the blows of Hanuman, chariot of Shankar got broken. His arms became unproductive. His body became worn out. Nandi was preparing to escape away. Calling Hanuman, Shankar told—‘Brave! You and so also your devotion to God is praise-worthy. I am very much pleased to see your valour and dedication to the Almighty. I am ready to give you boons, which one cannot get by performing Yagya and penance. Ask for, whatever you like?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman said—‘Shankar! By the grace of the Lord, I have no longing for anything, yet you are pleased with me in the war, so I would like to solve my some purpose. Just see, in the war Pushakal has been killed, Shatrughn has fainted, the army men are lying in the battle field being wounded badly, protect them along with your hosts. I depart for Dronachal to bring herbs of medicine. If the gods oppose, probably, I may have to fight there against them also, little delay is possible; let not anything untowards happen with these braves.’ Shankar accepted and Hanuman started his journey.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching near Kshirasagar, Hanuman rolled up Dronachal with his tail. Having uprooted it, he was about to start when the gods, its protectors, attacked him; but they became helpless before Hanuman, they were wounded and ran away. Approaching Lord Indra, they reported him that a monkey was taking away Dronachal with him, and their weapons proved worthless before him and then being perturbed he reached Brihaspati, his dynasty preceptor. Giving the detail introduction of Hanuman, Brihaspati tried to console and please them. Indra said—‘Lord! <span class="char-style-override-7">i</span>f Hanuman takes away uprooting Dronachal, the gods surely will die because that is the only source of our lives. Find out some remedy that Hanuman’s purpose may be served on one hand and the herbs of medicine may also be saved safe on the other hand.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Brihaspati along with Indra and other gods approached Hanuman. They implored earnestly and humbly before him, got their offence excused, and bestowing boon that His desires be fulfilled, handed-over the life-saving-medicine to him. Hanuman reached the battle field with the medicine. The joyous applause for Hanuman began all around far and wide. He came to Pushkal with the medicine. Pushkal had already died, using the medicine he said—‘If I would be knowing only Lord Ram by mind, speech and action, obeying His command only and no other object but His form remains to be existing before my sight, may Pusakal be alive with this medicine!’ The moment head was joined with the body, Pusakal got revivified and rushed to fight with Shankar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman went to Shatrughn. Shatrughn was in faint and muttering—‘Ram-Ram’, ‘Raghunandan Raghunandan’ etc., and sometimes made delirious talks about His activities. [Using the medicines Hanuman said]<span class="char-style-override-14">1 </span>‘By the grace of the Lord if I am a celibate all my life and my celibacy has never been broken down, may Shatrughn be alive at once!’<span class="char-style-override-14">2</span> Shatrughn got up and saying ‘Where is Shiv, I will just kill Him’, rushed towards the battle field. Again the fierce battle broke out, Viramani got fainted; Shankar and Shatrughn began to fight, when Shatrughn got distressed with the arrows of Shankar, Hanuman said—‘Now, remember your elder brother, the work will be done.’ Shatrughn did so and Ram presented Himself there. It was then when Shankar prayed Him with great love and devotion and begged for pardon admitting His unrectifiable fault.</p>

Those who differenciate us, go to hell. Those who are your devotees, are My devotees also. My devotees also worship you devotedly.’* The Lord made all the dead and wounded warriors alive with His touch. The king Viramani, dedicated his entire belongings and became a great devotee of Ram. Hanuman moved ahead with the horse.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">When the Lord Ram began to bid farewell to all the monkeys and bears and the turn of Hanuman came, he then fell down on the feet of the Lord. He prayed to the Lord—‘Lord! I will remain at your feet only.’ The Lord consented. Well! The Lord never forsakes such a devotee. The last time of departing to His abode came. Then, Lord called Hanuman close to Him and said—‘Hanuman! Now, I am departing for my own abode; but you will not be grieved. You will have to complete this unfavourable work. Remaining here on this earth, propagate peace, love and wisdom among the people. When you remember me, I will appear before you. You will remain present there wherever My stories are narrated, My reverential song goes on, I am, at all, not separated from you. It is only My frolicsome activity.’ Hanuman with folded hands said—‘Lord! I will remain present there, wherever your story is sermonised, I will listen to it, going there. That will be only the source of my life.’ The Lord got delighted very much. In a similar reference the Lord Ram had said to Hanuman—‘Hanuman! In this world so long as My stories continue, your auspicious glory and meritorious doings and your being will continue. I cannot repay your debt whatever good you have done to me even if I sacrifice My life in return of one by one good done to me. I may not repay your debt in return of doing good to me is right also. Let not any such time come in your life when you may require the return of your doing good; because only in the days of hardships and sufferings one needs the return of what good he has done.’ The Lord summed up His frolicsome activities*, but His devotee Lord Shankar’s activitiy continued—<span class="char-style-override-13">‘राम ते अधिक राम कर दासा।’</span> The devotees of Ram are greater to Himself.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">After the Lord Ram’s departure to His divine abode, Hanuman’s sole business was the reverential singing and hearing of Lord’s name, His frolicsome activities and virtues. Wherever, there was association of holy persons, Hanuman used to be present there without fail. Staying with  Arshtishen sage at ‘Kimpurusavarsha’ generally he used to listen to the virtues of the Lord. When the three worlds as a whole remained intoxicated in the sentimental pleasure of the melody and celestial music of the Gandharvs, Hanuman experienced directly the frolicsome activities of the Lord Ram through extracted Lord Ram’s nectarial song. A number of ages passed but he did not miss the memory of Lord even for a moment. It was none and nothing but the Lord only who remained before his eyes. No one else came before him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the twenty-eighth Dvapar of ‘Vaivasvt Manvantar’ Lord Sri Krishna incarnated. Sri Krishna and the Lord Ram are the same and not distinct. How then was it possible for Him to live without His dearest devotee, Hanuman? He resolved to call Hanuman, but alongwith it, also some frolicsome activity should be displayed and Hanuman’s magnanimity should be emphasised. If some short-comings have creeped in the so-called His own, these should be eradicated. Just with the resolve of the Lord, Hanuman reached a garden near Dwaraka. Chanting Lord names, began to eat the fruits and break the branches. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Those days, the Lord had forcibly brought Parijat for the pleasure of Satyabhama. She was proud of being the greatest beloved of the Lord. None is parallel to my beauty. In the course of conversation one day, she said also—Was Sita more beautiful than I that you remained searching from one forest to another in her separation? The Lord kept mum. Chakra was also proud of itself that he had overpowered Indra’s thunderbolt. Garuda too, thought that it was he, whose assistance had made Sri Krishnaa to win over Indra. Lord Sri Krishnaa thought that the vanity of all the three must be subdued. It is not tolerable to me that being my devotee, they should be egotist. How admirable grace of Lord is!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord called in Garud and ordered him that a monkey had appeared in the garden of Dwaraka, he should capture him and bring before <span class="char-style-override-7">h</span>im. See, if you dare to catch him without any help, then go alone, otherwise, take army also with you.’ Garud thought to himself that first, the Lord is sending me to captivate a common monkey and secondly, He asks to go with the army, what a great insult it is for me! I will break that monkey into pieces. Going all alone, Garud saw that Hanuman was eating fruits having his back to his side and chanting ‘Ram-Ram’ in a very carefree mood. First he tried to take Hanuman away rebuking and reprimanding, but Hanuman did not budge an inch even. When Garud invaded first, Hanuman went on playing with him just like people are used to play with the small birds; but when Garud did not yield, having rolled up Garud in his tail, he pressed it bit tightly. He began to flutter. Mentioning the name of Lord Sri Krishna, he said that he had approached there by the order of Lord Krishna, He had called him, He is directly Naryan in person, follow me. Releasing Garud, Hanuman said—‘Brother! Though, there is no distinction between Ram and Krishna, both are the same, yet I am dedicated to Sitanath Sri Ram, I am partial towards him. Why should I go to Sri Krishna?’ Saying this as if Hanuman co-operated the Lord in his play.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yet Garud’s ego had not been subdued. He thought that if he had not been caught in his hold, he would have taken away Hanuman forcibly. Again he attacked. Pride makes one blind. Considering him the messenger of Sri Krishna, Hanuman did not assault him violently, but holding him with his hands mildly threw him towards the sea. After falling down into the sea, Garud lost the idea of all directions. He remained fluttering there for a long duration. When he remembered the Lord, then, he could visualize the light of Dwaraka and he came to Sri Krishna. Hearing all about, Sri Krishna laughed. In Garud’s mind the pride of swift flying yet continued. He thought that even the wind could not compete him in flying, though Hanuman might be stronger than I in prowess.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—‘Garud! This time, go and convey to him—‘Your deity Lord Sri Ram is calling you. Start soon.’ Bring him along with yourself. He will not react this time. He will welcome you warmly.’ Though Garud was afraid of going there, yet he went to show his power of flying, The Lord said to Satyabhama—‘Come on disguised in the form of Sita, Hanuman is coming.’ He addressed Chakra—‘watch attentively, let not anybody enter Dwaraka.’ ‘Sudarsan Chakra’ began to guard very carefully and Satyabhama being overpowerd with the pride of her beauty, came and sat on. The Lord Sri Krishna became Ramchandra, bearing the bow and arrow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This time, Garud dared not go near Hanuman. From a distance he said that the Lord Sri Ram was calling him right now. If possible accompany me, otherwise be seated on my shoulders, I will carry you. Hanuman said very gladly—‘How fortunate I am that the Lord has called me. You, proceed on, I am just coming.’ Garud thought what he was saying, having started after me, how long will he take to reach? But he was frightened. He dared not speak to Hanuman anything again. Without uttering even a word, he set out silently. He was thinking he will boast of his fast speed before Lord after reaching Dwaraka. Hanuman reached Dwaraka quite earlier than Garud. In the view of Hanuman it was not Dwaraka but it was Ayodhya. At the gate, Chakra said arrogantly—‘I will not allow you to go inside.’ Hanuman said—‘You are creating hinderence in viewing the Lord and he caught him and kept in his mouth. Visiting there in the palace, he saw that the Lord Ram was glorifying the royal throne. He did not get the view of Mother Sita. Prostrating with all the eight limbs of his body at the feet of the Lord, Hanuman asked—‘My Lord! Where is the reverent mother today? Who is she occupying her place? Who is this maid whom you have esteemed so much?’ Satyabhama got ashamed. Her arrogance of beauty was eradicated. The Lord said—‘Hanuman! Did anybody not check you? How did you reach here?’ Taking the Chakra out of his mouth, Hanuman put it before Him. Chakra had lost its lustre. When running fast and going out of breath, Garud reached, he saw that Hanuman was already present there. His head bowed down. Thus, the vanity of all the three was subdued by the Lord by virtue of Hanuman and deputed Hanuman at the eastern gate of Dwaraka for the protection of Puri.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Those days, the Pandavs were in the ‘Kamyak Van’. One day, flying in the air, a very big and fragrant flower came before Draupadi. Draupadi requested Bhim to bring more such flowers and he set out towards the direction from which the flower had come. Bhim was proud of his bravery and he never thought of the pros and cons before doing anything. Hanuman thought that Bhim was his own brother. There should not be egotism in his mind and at present there is a great danger towards he is proceeding, lest any harm should assail him. Hanuman lay down on the way and stretched his long tail. Bhim did not recognise Hanuman. He said—‘Monkey! Remove your tail, otherwise I will break it.’ Hanuman made himself like an afflicted and said—‘Brother! My tail is very long, you are young and strong, cross it or remove it.’ Bhim said, ‘Whatever long your tail may be, I would have crossed it like my brother Hanuman who had crossed the sea; but the God is dwelling in the body of everyone, so it is not righteous to cross over anybody. I, just, remove your tail.’ First, he used his one hand, but the tail did not move at all, then, he used both the hands, yet it remained unshakable. He began to sweat. He got tired, but could not remove the tail. Now, Bhim realized to mind. Just, the pride being subdued, he recognised Hanuman. He repented for his doing, begged for pardon. Hanuman, having clung to his bosom, narrated to him the story of the Lord Ram. On the great insistance of Bhim, Hanuman showed his awful form which had crossed the sea. Then, again, he returned to his small form and gave him many pieces of his advice. He said—‘Never be proud of anything from now onwards. If you permit, I may ruin the entire city of Hastinapur at once and kill all the sons of Dhritarashtra and bring Duryodhan having tied him. Whatever you say, I am ready to do. But you will never disclose our meeting to anyone, and if any calamity occurs, remember me.’ Bhimsen said—‘I am fortunate to have a patron by getting your support, it is only your support that can enable us to win the enemy.’ Hanuman said—‘Bhim! When, having intruded into the army of the enemy, you make war-roar, I too, will make similarly the same roar being present on the top of Arjun’s flag and hearing my roar, your enemy will be dead like.’ Hanuman embraced Bhim and disappeared from there. Going on the way guided by Hanuman, Bhim possessed the flower.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Hanuman was not the least egotist at all. In the life of Hanuman, egotism was never seen and that is why the Lord used Hanuman to do away with the egotism of His devotees generally. It is said that once, Arjun also had developed pride of his arrow-power. In the course of conversation, one day, he said to Sri Krishna—‘Why did you take so much trouble to get the bridge built on the sea during your incarnation in Ram’s form? I would have built the bridge with my arrows’. You gave trouble to the poor monkeys unnecessarily. ‘The Lord began to laugh, His laugh, itself, is the illusion to delude the people.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—‘Well, get a bridge built on a small portion of the sea with your arrows. I just tell you.’ Arjun completed it instantaneously.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord remembered Hanuman, he at once came upon. By the order of the Lord, he climbed up the bridge. Just as he climbed up, the bridge began to break with creaking, he came down. Arjun noticed the blood on the back of the Lord. After query it came to the notice that if the Lord had not used His back to support it, the bridge would have cracked down by Hanuman and Arjun would have been the victim of laughter. The Lord said—‘Such monkeys were there in a large number, how would they have crossed the bridge of arrows?’ Arjun came to understand the matter. His egotism was humbled.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the order of the Lord, Arjun worshipped Hanuman greatly and performed preparatly ritual of his Mantras*. Hanuman granted him boon—‘I will always help you and in the ensuing war, I will protect you being seated on your chariot.’ It is said that by the arrows of Arjun all the chariots fell down far away but by the arrow of anybody, Arjun’s chariot did not move backward an inch even. Once, it was Karn’s arrow that moved Arjun’s chariot a little back, as a matter of its result, Sri Krishna praised Karn highly. Arjun asked—‘Lord! My arrow moves back Karn’s chariot far behind, and his arrow has moved back my chariot a little behind, then, what is there to praise him?’ The Lord said—‘Arjun! Hanuman is sitting on your chariot, otherwise, your chariot would have burnt to ashes. In spite of Hanuman remaining seated on your chariot, it just moved back even a little, is the indication and symbol of Karn’s very great bravery.’ Arjun’s doubt was cleared. In the end of the great war, when Hanuman jumped down from the Arjun’s chariot, his chariot got burnt to ashes. It was the glory of Hanuman that Arjun fought so bravely.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Pradyumn, the son of Sri Krishna, had set out to conquer the world, ‘Ashwamedh-Yagya’ was about to be performed prerequisite in Dwarika and it was its background. Conquering the world, he reached Hiranmayakhand. At that time, Arjun was also accompanying him and Hanuman was present at the flag of his chariot. In Hiranmayakhand, there was a terrible war fought by Pradyumn against the progeny of Nal-Nil. Arjun was also fighting. The brave monkeys there dashed down Arjun’s and Pradyumn’s chariot having rolled up it with their tails. A fierce battle was fought, at last, Hanuman jumped down from the flag of the chariot, and wrapped up all the monkeys under his tail. When they came to know that it was Hanuman, all the inhabitants of the place worshipped Hanuman, Pradyumn and Arjun with great devotion and reverence. Several types of objects were presented in gift. From there again they set out for another direction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a great seer of Truth Hanuman was, is known through ‘Ramrahasya-Upanishad’. Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatkumar and Sanatan, all the four brothers learn the profoundity of ‘Ram-Mantras’ from him. Renowned sages and Prahlad are his pupils. It was Ram, Himself, who has explained to him the Tattva of the Upanishads, this is stated in ‘Muktikopanishad’ and in other different mythological scriptures, the character of Maruti has been described in detail. Here, some very important events of his life have been mentioned and written in brief.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Maruti has gone nowhere. It is here, he is present; even to-day, he is among us. It is only that we don’t recognise him. It is because of our not having devotion and reverence for him. The saints like Tulasidas etc., have come face to face with Maruti in the present era itself. Even now, there are such aspirants, who attain Lord Maruti. There are several ‘Mantrs’ and rites and rituals in the ‘Shastrs’ to attain him. By performing such rituals with devotion, we can view Maruti. By remembering him, our innerself becomes holy and pious and by his grace, god is attained.’</p>
