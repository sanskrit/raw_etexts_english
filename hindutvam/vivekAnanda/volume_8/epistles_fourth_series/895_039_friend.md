## XXXIX

*To Mr. Francis Leggett*

NEW YORK,  
*10th April, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND,

It is impossible to express my gratitude for your kindly inviting me to
your country seat \[Ridgely\]. I am involved in a mistake now and find
it impossible for me to come tomorrow. Tomorrow I have a class at Miss
Andrews' of 40 W. 9th Street. As I was given to understand by Miss
MacLeod that that class could be postponed, I was only too glad at the
prospect of joining the company tomorrow. But I find that Miss MacLeod
was mistaken and Miss Andrews came to tell me that she could not by any
means stop the class tomorrow or even give notice to the members, who
are about 50 or 60 in number.

In view of this I sincerely regret my inability and hope that Miss
MacLeod and Mrs. Sturges will understand that it is an unavoidable
circumstance, and not the will, that stands in the way of my taking
advantage of your kind invitation.

I shall only be too glad to come day after tomorrow, or any other day
this week, as it suits you.

Ever sincerely yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
