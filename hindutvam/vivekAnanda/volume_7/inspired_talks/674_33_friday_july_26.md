## RECORDED BY MISS S. E. WALDO (A DISCIPLE)

FRIDAY, *July 26, 1895*. (*Brihadâranyakopanishad*.)

Love all things only through and for the Self. Yâjnavalkya said to
Maitreyi, his wife, "Through the Atman we know all things." The Atman
can never be the object of knowledge, nor can the Knower be known. He
who knows he is the Atman, he is law unto himself. He knows he is the
universe and its creator. . . .

Perpetuating old myths in the form of allegories and giving them undue
importance fosters superstition and is really weakness. Truth must have
no compromise. Teach truth and make no apology for any superstition;
neither drag truth to the level of the listener.
