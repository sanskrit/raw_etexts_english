title = "The beginning of bhArgava tradition of bhUta-DAmara"

+++
The preliminary section of the bhUtaDAmaraM with the vajra-maNDala
mantras and the sarvAparasa prayoga appear to be a distinct module that
was acquired secondarily by current bhUtaDAmaraM. The beginning of the
core section of the ancestral bhArgava tradition of the bhUtaDAmaraM and
unmattabhairavaM that was obtained from nIlarudra begins with the
following rites and mantras. Their connections to the older atharvan
tradition is reasonably transparent.  

- The section begins by saying that one must proceed to procure
oShadhi-s (technically termed oShadhi grahaNa vidhi by the bhArgava-s
and a\~Ngirasas) for medical and ritual use only by applying the
appropriate mantra-s otherwise, instead of a bheShaja one merely gets a
pile of wood.  
- It advised that plants growing on termite nests, wells, at the base of
shady trees, on chariot roads, groves of gods or graveyards be avoided
for collection.  
- Plants that are damaged by fire, water or parasitic infestations,
unseasonally growing, or trampled to the ground should be avoided.
Plants should be collected only in the prescribed amount required for
the user.  
- One gets up in the morning and worships rudra surrounded by his hordes
of bhUta-s. Then with worshipful attitude to The god one set forth for
collection.  
- Going to the plant that one wishes to obtain one utters the spell:  

> OM vetAlAshca piShAchAshcha rAkShasAshcha sarIsR^ipA: |  
apa sarpantu te sarve vR^ikShAdasmAchChivAj\~nayA ||  
One thus invokes rudra to command the vetAla-s, pishAcha-s, rAkShasas
and reptiles to crawl away from the plant.  
Then one invokes the oShadhi with the following formula:  
OM namaste .amR^itasaMbhUte bala-vIrya-vivardhini |  
balamAyuShcha me dehi pApAnme trAhi dUrataH ||  
The herbs, the descendents of soma, are asked to provide strength,
fertility and long life and remove pApa-s

Then thinking of the mAyA and pratya\~ngirA bIja-s one utters the
following incantation:  

> yena tvAM khanate brahmA yena tvAM khanate bhR^igu | yena indro.atha
varuNo yena tvAM upachakrame | tenAhaM khaniShyAmi mantra pUtena pANinA
||  
mA te pAte mAnipAti mA te tejo.anyathAbhavet |  
atraiva tiShTha kalyANi mama kAryakarI bhava ||  
OM hrIM kShrauM svAhA | anena mUlikAM chedayet ||

Thus, as bhR^igu and brahman priest had dug herbs, as indra and varuNa
had incised herbs thus purifying with mantras one collects the good
herbs for the achievement of ones tasks.

The regular vashIkaraNa herbs are said to be: apAmArga, gorochana (a
lump of taurine from cow’s gall bladder), daNDotpala roots,
shvetAparajita roots, indivAra lotus roots, banyan fig roots.
vishvAmitra is said to have expounded the vashikaraNa chapter of the
tantra.

An interesting receipe is given for destruction of lice and mites: The
viDa\~Nga and gandhotpala plants are extracted using gomutra. Then the
extract is heated and colloidized with castor oil. This preparation is
applied on the hair to destroy external parasites.

For alopecia the following is recommended: The hair is first treated
with an extract of the javA flower in gomUtra. Then turmeric treated
with alkali is mixed with equal amount of powder of the maricha root.
Then the mixture is extracted with hot oil. The extract is mixed with
the juice of the bimba flower and the resultant paste is applied on the
head.

It also gives a long version of the mahiShamardini formula used for
agni-stambhana prayoga:  

> OM hrIM mahiShamardini laha laha hala hala kaTha kaTha stambhaya
stambhaya agniM svAhA ||
