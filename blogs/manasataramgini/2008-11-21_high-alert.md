Between Oct 19th to Oct 25th the last six arrows were used up. We had
repulsed he grAhin but were attacked by other weapons. Now we were
without weapons. Till the evening of Oct 15th we held an upper hand. A
mishap then appears to have given them a chance to attack with the
grAhin again. We had a faint hint of the grAhin. On 13th there was again
a hint of an attack but we gained an upper hand. Today a much larger
force was sent and it was confirmed that the grAhin was back. Unlike in
the past we were absolutely lacking in one great astra-s. Anything could
happen.
