A number of idols have been routinely used by my family in various
upAsanas. A few are detailed below:

The rudra family: The wooden kumAra on the left is our patron deity, the
deity of the clan and the protector deity. The idol is routinely
installed on the trienniel skanda yAga performed as per the atharvaNa
krama ordained by gopatha. The central idol is the bronze idol of uma
and rudra that has been worshiped for a long time now by my clansmen for
various festivals and receives regular rudrArchana. The vinAyaka on the
right with the ceremonial a\~Nkusha, stone lamps and gajadIpa is
ceremonially bathed and deployed in several sAdhanas including the
regular chaturti-vrata. Receives regular atharvashIrasArchana.

The sarasvati-series: The one on the left is the bR^ihad nIlA-sarasvatI,
also known as bhaiShajya sarasvatI- worshipped by the secret offerings
known as vAmadevya made as per the atharvaNa krama. It is a protector
idol of the clan and the tassle of atharvanic bird feathers hang on the
idol. One on the right is the viri\~nchI-preyasyA, also worshipped as
mahAsarasvatI.

The lakShmInArAyaNa pair: used for worship with the mantra viShNumAya,
the sahasranAma vidhi and nArAyanArchana. The saura maNDala is used for
the saura prayogas. Of course the other maNDala and its details remain
secret.
