I am excluding the Durgotsava-s here,since they are purANAntargata from
here,and are temporary. But amongst shAkta AgAmas,I really am not able
to think of any one that is specifically meant for parArthArchanA. I
know there are many shrines embodying
shrIvidyA,[old](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/rajitas-account-of-shrividyas-imprint-on-the-topography-of-himachal/)
and new,but the AgAma as such presupposes worship at home. Even AgAmas
devoted to parArthArchanA like pA\~ncharAtra,vaikhAnasa and siddhAnta
are [evolutes of
systems](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2009/01/11/some-aspects-of-vaikhanasa-iconic-worship-and-their-parallels/)
that presupposed home worship. Even early shaiva siddhAnta did not
really have much of parArtha-archanA,but a few texts do know of temples
for exclusively a sAdhakaâ€™s purposes,so initiates would want to make
sure that no one else knows the shrine/not allow non-initiates in the
shrine.

(Note:I am not questioning the legitimacy of those devI temples).
