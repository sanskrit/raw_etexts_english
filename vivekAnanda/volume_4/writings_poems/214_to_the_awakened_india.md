## TO THE AWAKENED INDIA

(Written to *Prabuddha Bharata* or *Awakened India*, in August 1898,
when the journal was transferred from Madras to Almora Himalayas, into
the hands of the Brotherhood founded by Swami Vivekananda.)

Once more awake!  
For sleep it was, not death, to bring thee life  
Anew, and rest to lotus-eyes for visions  
Daring yet. The world in need awaits, O Truth!  
No death for thee!

Resume thy march,  
With gentle feet that would not break the  
Peaceful rest even of the roadside dust  
That lies so low. Yet strong and steady,  
Blissful, bold, and free. Awakener, ever  
Forward! Speak thy stirring words.

Thy home is gone,  
Where loving hearts had brought thee up and  
Watched with joy thy growth. But Fate is strong —  
This is the law — all things come back to the source  
They sprung, their strength to renew.

Then start afresh  
From the land of thy birth, where vast cloud-belted  
Snows do bless and put their strength in thee,  
For working wonders new. The heavenly  
River tune thy voice to her own immortal song;  
Deodar shades give thee eternal peace.

And all above,  
Himala's daughter Umâ, gentle, pure,  
The Mother that resides in all as Power  
And Life, who works all works and  
Makes of One the world, whose mercy  
Opens the gate to Truth and shows  
The One in All, give thee untiring  
Strength, which is Infinite Love.

They bless thee all,  
The seers great, whom age nor clime  
Can claim their own, the fathers of the  
Race, who felt the heart of Truth the same,  
And bravely taught to man ill-voiced or  
Well. Their servant, thou hast got  
The secret — 'tis but One.

Then speak, O Love!  
Before thy gentle voice serene, behold how  
Visions melt and fold on fold of dreams  
Departs to void, till Truth and Truth alone  
In all its glory shines —

And tell the world —  
Awake, arise, and dream no more!  
This is the land of dreams, where Karma  
Weaves unthreaded garlands with our thoughts  
Of flowers sweet or noxious, and none  
Has root or stem, being born in naught, which  
The softest breath of Truth drives back to  
Primal nothingness. Be bold, and face  
The Truth! Be one with it! Let visions cease,  
Or, if you cannot, dream but truer dreams,  
Which are Eternal Love and Service Free.
