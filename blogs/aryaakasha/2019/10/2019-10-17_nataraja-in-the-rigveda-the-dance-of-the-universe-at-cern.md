The Shiva Nataraja Murti at CERN in Switzerland. I‚Äôve written about the
general characteristics and iconography of the Nataraja Aspect before,
but I had this particular statue in mind in light of a RigVedic verse we
were working with over the weekend.

Now, the Nataraja at CERN is done in a style which has been particularly
prominent, historically, in South India; and I have previously pointed
towards the form as demonstrating the manner in which South Indian
Hinduism has re-emphasized and re-introduced elements to the
Indo-European mythoreligious complex that have lain somewhat more
dormant elsewhere (although never entirely extinguished ‚Äì but the
association of Odin with Dance and the performing arts is ‚Ä¶ not as
strong in the minds of many as it might otherwise be, to take but one
example).

This is also something I have done in response and riposte to the
various people ‚Äì including some rather well-known names ‚Äì who go out of
their way to attempt to insist that the Puranic and subsequent forms and
functions of Shiva are somehow non-Indo-European. Because it just isn‚Äôt
true.

And the underlying \*unity\*, \*harmony\* of this much more recent image
and representation, with the RigVedic verses which I‚Äôll get on to in a
moment ‚Ä¶ well, it goes further to illustrate this principle. As well as,
funnily enough, providing \*additional\* grounds for the Murti‚Äôs
metaphorical salience at CERN üòÄ

RV I 164 :

‚Äú12 They call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed, of
twelve forms, wealthy in watery store.  
These others say that he, God with far-seeing eyes, is mounted on the
lower seven-wheeled, six-spoked car.  
13 Upon this five-spoked wheel revolving ever all living creatures rest
and are dependent.  
Its axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient time remains
unbroken.‚Äù

Now, as ever, the Vedic verses lose something quite considerable in
translation. Yet what we see here is but a small slice of a cosmological
Hymnal, in which is contained something of a ‚Äòroad-map‚Äô of the universe
\[I say ‚Äúroad-map‚Äù, because whereas a map is a map, a road-map also
shows a journey, a function, a \*progressing\* with its unfurling as we
go\].

At the center of the illustration in these verses is what we might,
perhaps, think of as an Axis Mundi, a Pillar (or Sacrificial Post) about
which all other forms, happenings, and emanation of the fabric of the
world(s) is contingent .

These radiatings are elucidated in poetic terms in these lines as well
as others; and include both Time \[a strongly Shaivite as well as Shakta
concept P And one of the potential interpretations around the Number
Twelve ‚Äì the Number Six also bearing this conceptry ‚Ä¶ Three Worlds,
times Two for Night-Day Cycles, and the Over and Under Up/Down sides of
each\], and what is inherent in Space, in Matter, in Energy. \[the
number Seven referring frequently to Piety, to Faith, to the conduits to
the Divine, as prime forces within and running through this universe of
ours. For instance, the Seven Tongues of Agni, the Seven Voices with
which Brihaspati and Vak Sing in Chorus, the Seven Rivers, the Seven
Sages, and so forth\]

And what do we find around this central pillar? Five Limbs, Five Hands
and Feet (well, four hands and one foot, akin to spokes of the Great
Wheel, seen in the Circle of Fire that is the Universe and its Energy
and Time (Time as Fire .. within which we burn) ‚Ä¶ the other Foot forming
the base of the pillar) . And what do \*these\* represent? Well, in this
Vedic verse, the Five Elements (PanchaBhuta) which make up almost All
and Everything.

To return to that Central Pillar also ‚Äì particularly in light of the
‚Äònave‚Äô element, the concept of Rta as Cord or Thread or Pillar running
through the Universe from Above and Beyond, from AdiParaShakti ‚Äì in this
case, ‚Äúunbroken‚Äù; we again find elements that shall turn up in later
Shaivite (and Shakta) depictions, theology. Consider these points from
earlier in the hymnal:

‚Äú7 Let him who knoweth presently declare it, this lovely Bird‚Äôs securely
founded station.  
Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and, wearing his vesture, with
their foot have drunk the water.  
8 The Mother gave the Sire his share of Order: with thought, at first,
she wedded him in spirit.‚Äù

We see clearly, the concept of the Ganga descending to Shiva‚Äôs Hair from
the Upplands beyond and above the Universe, and thence emanating out in
nourishment to the broader, wider world. We see also, the relationship
between Shiva & Shakti ‚Äì Brihaspati and Vak, in Vedic terms, but also
the elements of the famed DeviSukta of the Xth Mandala which I have
written about at some length for #NavRatri this year, inter alia. Vak,
in a certain sense, also meaning Divine Thought-Form, and both this and
Spirit referring to the interaction of Prakriti & Purusha .

I could go on at further length, but this shall do for now.

Contained within the iconographic depictions of the NatarajaMurti are
the natural developments and elaborations upon these foundations from
Vedic Verse.

Contained within these Vedic verses are observations and elucidations of
the fundamental nature and cosmological principles of the Universe.

You know ‚Ä¶ that thing which CERN is quite big upon ‚Äì running a particle
accelerator‚Äôs a rather interesting ‚Äòring of energy‚Äô approach, as well üòõ
(the foot connecting with what is under it being the place and position
of ignorance between the ends where we start from in the course of our
journeying of discovery; and which is beaten down upon in the
progressive dancing of the universe-in-motion, also)
