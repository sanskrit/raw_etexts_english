title = "The sarvAtman hymn to viShNu"

+++
The sarvAtmAn hymn to viShNu shows some variations between recensions
and traditions but form accepted amongst smArtas has 40 core shlokas
corresponding to Mbh 12.47.23-63. This an extremely important hymn of
viShNu, comparable to the hymn to rudra by the goat-faced dakSha. The
R^iShi of sarvAtmaka mahAvaiShNava stotra is given as bhagavAn vyAsa,
the Chandas is anuShTubh, the devAtA is sarvAtmaka mahA-viShNu.

Its importance lies in the fact that it might represent one of the
earliest post-vedic compositions to viShNu, within an early vaiShNava
lineage that was strongly affiliated with vedic ritualism. An important
point to note is that the critical version of the hymn shared by all
recensions and practiced by smArtas does not have any mention of the
avatAra-s or the vAsudeva-centric elements of sAttvata that contributed
to pA\~nchAratra. So its original composition was possibly outside of
these streams and was latter swallowed into the sAttvata context (as
much of the vaiShNava material in the mahAbhArata belongs to the early
sAttvata tradition). We suspect that there were 3 streams of early
vaiShNavism: 2 associated with the kR^iShNa yajurvedins: 1) The
taittirIyas, of which the vaikhAnasa branch gave rise to an early
vaiShNava system. 2) the kaTHas who possibly incorporated an early
avatAra model centered on yaGYa-varaha (viShNu smR^iti, viShNu-dharma
and viShNu-dharmottara eventually emerged from this school). 3) The
sAttvata-s who promulagated the chatur-vyUha system and developed other
aspects of the avatAra concept centered on kR^iShNa. This was the
precursor of the later pA\~ncharAtra. It is possible, but not certain,
that this school might have had association with a shukla-yajurvedic
shAkha called ekAyana. This school was strong in Mathura and interacted
with the early shaivas and kaumAra-s, who also have a presence in the
mahAbhArata. In later history all these three schools extensively
exchanged concepts, espcially in terms of the avatAra concept.

The famous concept that in the bright fortnight the soma cup of the moon
is drained by the deva, whereas in the dark fortnight by the manes is
expressed here. The vedic idea of soma as rAja of the brAhmaNas is
repeated.

Here we find an identification of viShNu as the agnichayana: the
bR^ihad-uktha is the collection of 80 triR^ichas recited in the final
part of the agnichayana. ” you are the fire, the great sacrificial
ritual is the reference to the agnichayana”

viShNu is identified with the 3 vedic recitation, the 10 half oblations
and the 7 thread from which the sacrifice is woven. Typically this is
taken to mean 7 main Chandas: gAyatri, uShNik, anuStubh, triShTubh,
jagati, bR^ihati and pankti or the 7 vyAhR^iti calls.

yaH suparNo yajurnAma Chando gAtras trivR^ichChirAH |

This idea, extensively developed in the ritual of the pA\~ncharAtra
tantras, is the construction of the body of viShNu by vedic mantras:
suparNa yajushes are his name, the Chandas the body, the trivR^it the
head, the bR^ihat and rathanthara sAmans his body. The specific
identification with yajur hymns is an aspect seen in vaikhAnasas and
some pA\~ncharAtric texts. This makes one wonder if the sarvAtman was
actually a production of the early vaikhAnasas, who were one of the
first of the more “vedically oriented” vaiShNavas. This is supported by
the five-fold manifestation of viShNu mentioned below, which is an
important tenet of [vaikhAnasa
thought](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/02/note-on-vaikhanasa-tradition.html).

viShNu is called the R^iShi in the satra with the 1000-fold pouring in
which the world was generated and equated to the famous vedic golden
bird “hirANya pakShaM shakunaM”.

viShNu is identified with sAMkhya thought. viShNu is called the 17th
entity of sAMkhya, enveloped the 16 attributes. Based on the commentary
of nIlakaNTha one might suggest that the 17th is the puruSha, while the
16 are prakR^iti + her evolutes (possibly 5 bhUta-s, 5 karmendriya and 5
GYAnendriyas)

viShNu is identified with yoga here–explicitly yoga is describe as the
control of breath (prANAyAma) and withdrawal from sense-inputs.

viShNu is depicted as sleeping as an infant on the ekArNava after
devouring the universe and creating the pralaya. This form is recalled
in pA\~ncharAtra and is encountered by mArkaNDeya.
