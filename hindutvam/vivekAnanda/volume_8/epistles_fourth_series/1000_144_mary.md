## CXLIV

*To Miss Mary Hale*

RIDGELY MANOR,  
*3rd October, 1899*.

MY DEAR MARY,

Thanks for your very kind words. I am much better now and growing so
every day. Mrs. Bull and her daughter are expected today or tomorrow. We
hope thus to have another spell of good time — you are having yours all
the time, of course. I am glad you are going to Philadelphia, but not so
much now as then — when the millionaire was on the horizon. With all
love,

Ever your affectionate brother,

VIVEKANANDA.
