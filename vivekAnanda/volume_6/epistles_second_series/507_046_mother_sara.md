## XLVI

HOTEL BELLE VUE,  
BEACON STREET, BOSTON  
*19th September, '94*.

DEAR MOTHER SARA, (Mrs. Ole Bull)

I did not forget you at all. You do not think I will be ever as
ungrateful as that! You did not give me your address, still I have been
getting news about you from Landsberg through Miss Phillips. Perhaps you
have seen the memorial and address sent to me from Madras. I sent some
to be sent to you at Landsberg's.

A Hindu son never lends to his mother, but the mother has every right
over the son and so the son in the mother. I am very much offended at
your offering to repay me the nasty few dollars. I can never repay my
debts to you.

I am at present lecturing in several places in Boston. What I want is to
get a place where I can sit down and write down my thoughts. I have had
enough of speaking; now I want to write. I think I will have to go to
New York for it. Mrs. Guernsey was so kind to me, and she is ever
willing to help me. I think I will go to her and sit down and write my
book.

Yours ever affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Kindly write me whether the Guernseys have returned to town or are
still in Fishkill. — V.
