## CXCV

*Letter of Introduction*

GAUHATI

*April 17, 1901*

I have great pleasure in certifying the great amiability and helpfulness
of the brothers Shivakanta and Lakshmikanta, Pandas of Shri Kamakhya
Peetham.

They are men who help most and are satisfied with the least.

I can unhesitatingly recommend them to the Hindu public visiting this
most holy shrine.
