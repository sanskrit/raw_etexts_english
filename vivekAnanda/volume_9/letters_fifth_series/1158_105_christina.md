## CV

*To Sister Christine*

DARJEELING,  
\[RETURN ADDRESS: ALAMBAZAR MATH, CALCUTTA\]

*16th March 1897*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Many, many thanks for the photograph and the poem. I never saw anything
half as beautiful. The work I had to do to reach Calcutta from Ceylon
was so immense that I could not earlier acknowledge your precious gift.
The work has broken me down completely, and I have got "diabetes", an
incurable disease, which must carry me off — at least in a few years.

I am now writing to you from Darjeeling, the nearest hill station to
Calcutta, with a climate as cool as London. It has revived me a bit. If
I live, I will come to America next year or so.

How are things going on with you all? How are Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\] and
Mrs. Phelps?

Are you laying by a few dollars whenever you can? That is very
important.

I am in a hurry for the mail. You will be glad to know that the Indian
people have, as it were, risen in a mass to honour me. I am the idol of
the day. Mr. Goodwin is going to publish in book form all the addresses
given to me and the speeches in reply. The demonstrations all over have
been simply unique.

Yours with all love,  
VIVEKANANDA.
