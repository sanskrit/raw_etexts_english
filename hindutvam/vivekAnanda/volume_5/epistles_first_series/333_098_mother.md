## XCVIII

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH DIST., BENGAL,  
*2nd February, 1901*.

MY DEAR MOTHER, (Mrs. Ole Bull)

Several days ago I received your letter and a cheque for Rs. 150
included. I will tear up this one, as the three previous cheques I have
handed over to my cousin.

Joe is here, and I have seen her twice; she is busy visiting. Mrs.
Sevier is expected here soon *en route* to England. I expected to go to
England with her, but as it now turns out, I must go on a long
pilgrimage with my mother.

My health suffers the moment I touch Bengal; anyhow, I don't much mind
it now; I am going on well and so do things about me.

  
Glad to learn about Margot's success, but, says Joe, it is not
financially paying; there is the rub. Mere continuance is of little
value, and it is a far cry from London to Calcutta. Well, Mother knows.
Everybody is praising Margot's *Kali the Mother*; but alas! they can't
get a book to buy; the booksellers are too indifferent to promote the
sale of the book.

That this new century may find you and yours in splendid health and
equipment for a yet greater future is and always has been the prayer of
your son.

VIVEKANANDA.
