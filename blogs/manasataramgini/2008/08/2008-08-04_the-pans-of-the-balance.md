We had long ago said that he had attained eko-mAnuSha AnandaH, but he
was not happy. He remained vigorous in the quest of new wealth and new
glory. The gifts of viShNupatni mattered to him above all. He welcomed
her to his house with his efforts, but behind shrI came the hideous
jyeShThA. He and family were seized by jyeShThA. Unlike his most
illustrious ancestors, the smoke from whose fire altars reached the
skies, he had no mantra-s. So he could not keep alakShmI away when she
came and his Ananda was ended. The wanderer somasharman said “all is
transient” and moved on bearing the kapAla in his hand.

The other shreShTha arrived full of expectation. He looked at
somasharman and lectured at some length. Then he declared, surely this
somasharman must be a goner. Could there be someone so singularly
interested in the obscure – obscure organisms, obscure molecules and
obscure texts, that to in a “dead language”. Surely this somasharman is
an obscurantist\! Leaving the shreShTha without any reaction he wandered
on, with his kapAla. He passed the bower where he and his good friend of
yore, rati-vallabha-paNDita had rejoiced in the halcyon days. He said to
himself again “all is transient”, rati-vallabha is gone. Just then he
saw mR^iganayanikA pass by riding a gardabha. As she passed him she
turned not to look at him, but shouted: “let it be known to Doldrum that
Dildrum still lives.”
