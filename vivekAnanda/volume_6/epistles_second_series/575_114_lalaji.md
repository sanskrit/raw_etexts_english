## CXIV

39 VICTORIA STREET,  
LONDON S.W.,  
*21st November, 1896*.

DEAR LALAJI, (Lala Badri Sah)

I reach Madras about the 7th of January; after a few days in the plains
I intend to come up to Almora.

I have three English friends with me. Two of them, Mr. and Mrs. Sevier,
are going to settle in Almora. They are my disciples, you know, and they
are going to build the Goliath for me in the Himalayas. It was for that
reason I asked you to look for some suitable site. We want a whole hill,
with a view of the snow-range, all to ourselves. It would of course take
time to fix on the site and complete the building. In the meanwhile will
you kindly engage a small bungalow for my friends? The bungalow ought to
accommodate three persons. I do not require a large one. A small one
would do for the present. My friends will live in this bungalow in
Almora and then go about looking for a site and building.

You need not reply to this letter, as before your reply will reach me, I
shall be on my way to India. I will write to you from Madras as soon as
I reach there.

With love and blessings to you all, 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.
