Yes, we know it’s not Thursday … but it IS J.R.R. Tolkien’s Birthday !
So, upon this occasion of Tolkien-Jayanti , here’s something we prepared
earlier looking at a rather … surprising underpinning Indo-European
characterization to the figure of Gandalf :

IT IS THURSDAY – JUPITER’S DAY – THEREFORE, BRIHASPATI

Now, some among ye are presumably looking a bit in askance at this …
because that’s Gandalf. Except … bear with me here …

First up, Gandalf is, rather strongly and directly, based on Odin. I’m
pretty sure Tolkien went a bit further and made the representation
*explicit*. But even leaving this aside, consider some of the further
similarities: Síðhöttr \[‘Wide Hat\[ed\]’\], Síðskeggr \[‘Long
Beard\[ed\]’\], Váfuðr and Gangleri \[‘Wanderer’\], Göndlir
\[‘Wand-bearer’, ‘Staff-carryer’ – same root as Gand-alf’s actual
name\], Hroptr and Sviðurr \[‘Wise One’\]; the One in the dark-blue
head-covering Who turns up where unexpected and most needed.

And Odin, as we demonstrated rather resoundingly in the course of the
GHOST DIVISION series, is Brihaspati. Or, to phrase “Brihaspati” in Old
Norse … Galdraföðr.

Yet what … nearly had me falling out of my seat, were the following
lines from the translation of a certain RigVedic Hymnal:

“2 He who with might bowed down the things that should be bowed, and in
his fury rent the holds of Śambara:  
Who overthrew what shook not, Brahmaṇaspati,—he made his way within the
mountain stored with wealth.  
3 That was a great deed for the Godliest of the Gods: strong things were
loosened and the firmly fixed gave way.  
He drave the kine forth and cleft Vala through by prayer, dispelled the
darkness and displayed the light of heaven.  
4 The well with mouth of stone that poured a flood of meath, which
Brahmaṇaspati hath opened with his might—  
All they who see the light have drunk their fill thereat: together they
have made the watery fount flow forth.  
5 Ancient will be those creatures, whatsoe’er they be; with moons, with
autumns, doors unclose themselves to you.  
Effortless they pass on to perfect this and that, appointed works which
Brahmaṇaspati ordained.  
6 They who with much endeavour searching round obtained the Paṇis’
noblest treasure hidden in the cave,—  
Those sages, having marked the falsehoods, turned them back whence they
had come, and sought again to enter in.”

Now, I am not going to do an in-depth commentary upon all the allusions
and meanings of those lines – either in English or in Sanskrit.

Only note that a ‘surface portion’ what is effectively being described
there is Brihaspati’s successful vanquishing of ancient and even
downright *demonic* evils in forts, dungeons, and (a) cave(s) –
including one Dragon, thence liberating and redistributing its lost,
ill-gotten, pilfered, glittering hoard.

And there are futher similarities, too – all those lines pertaining to
the re-flowing of waters, the attainment and piling up of wealth, the
restoration of ancient ways and proper conduct (especially in songs),
the bringing of joy and happiness with His arrival, and the citation
elsewhere in the hymn for the Solar Rays of His Beneficence causing the
plants to grow … well …

“The King beneath the mountains,  
The King of carven stone,  
The lord of silver fountains  
Shall come into his own!

His crown shall be upholden,  
His harp shall be restrung,  
His halls shall echo golden  
To songs of yore re-sung.

The woods shall wave on mountains  
And grass beneath the sun;  
His wealth shall flow in fountains  
And the rivers golden run.

The streams shall run in gladness,  
The lakes shall shine and burn,  
All sorrow fail and sadness  
At the Mountain-king’s return!”

But the part from the aforementioned RigVedic Hymnal that always gets me
is this line:  
” with moons, with autumns, doors unclose themselves to you.”

After all, how is it that the Lonely Mountain is gained access to?
Moon-Runes, on the Last Moon of Autumn, which provide the unlocking of
the door. The Granting of the Boon of Insight – especially as applies
language and word-games – is Brihaspati’s to make use of and to bestow.
\[note: I’m not seriously proposing that either a) that’s how that line
is to be fully interpreted; nor b) that Tolkien was *intentionally and
consciously* running off ancient Vedic scripture in its construction. I
just find it a pretty extraordinary ‘lining up’\]

Although one of the more subtle points of close coterminity betwixt
Brihaspati and Gandalf, is also one of the seriously important –
Brihaspati is hailed as bringing, as selecting, sending, empowering,
Heroes.

And if you think about it … as mighty as Gandalf most assuredly is
(whether Grey or White) – His grandest contribution to the legendarium
of Tolkien in some ways, has tended to be in *exactly* that.

Of course, you *may* be wondering about the RPG – it’s certainly a bit
of a furtherance of Gandalf’s well-known proclivity for pyrotechnics. A
weapon forged by Elves. *Soviet* Elves!

This, too, has a certain level of Indo-European mythological precedency:
the chief weapon of Brihaspati is often reckoned to be the Bow \[also
occasionally the Spear\] ; the arrows of which are most certainly
impressively armour-piercing. And, dependent upon the war-head in
question \[yes, Divine Arrows have quite a variable payload in that
particular regard – hence the various “-Astra” weapons of just such
various natures\], quite likely explosive upon detonative contact with
the foe.

Anyway, while Sir Anthony Hopkins has done a pretty decent job
portraying Odin in a recent filmic trilogy \[and Liam Neeson, star of
the entire genre of films known as “Liam Neeson Kills People”, as well
as being a rather decent Jedi, has been Zeus for at least two
franchises\] … I think that there is a pretty decent argument to be made
for Sir Ian McKellen to retain *this* particular role in some
hypothetical #NAS film.
