title = "Indo-Aryans of the Middle East"

+++
The Indo-Aryans of the second millenium Middle East have been a topic of
continuing interest highlighted beginning with the works of Johannes
Friedrich in 1929. Subsequently, Mironov and PE Dumont have also
expanded upon this subject. These studies are of key importance to the
Aryan problem, which may be briefly described as the question of time
and place of origin of the Indo-Aryan languages of India and its
speakers. In my opinion the traces of Indo-Aryan in the Middle East are
indisputable; however, it is clear that only words and no complete
Indo-Aryan language surives in these regions.The chief traces of IA in
the Middle-East are the famous horse training manual of Kikkuli the
Mitannian in the land of the Hittites, the Hittite-Mitanni treaty, and
various texts from Syria, Nuzi and Mitanni documents. From the
Indo-Aryan names of the royalty and the presence in the specialized
horse-training manual it is suggestive that the Indo-Aryan population
was relatively restricted to a mobile equestrian elite. The words
appears to be a superstrate on the Hurrian (an old Asiatic language of
possible Caucasian affinities) the language of the original people of
Syria and the main consitituents of the Mitanni Kingdom.

- deities directly mentioned: mitra, varuNa, nAsatya-s, indra
(Hittite-Mitanni treaty), lord of vasukhanni (mine of wealth?)  
- deities inferred from personal names: svardAta (suvar= dyaus), indrota
(indra), vAyava (vAyu), vasudAta (vasu-s); viryasoma (soma).  
- Horse/chariot-related names: vR^iddhAshva, tviShratha, vArdhAshva,
ashvasani, yuga, vartana, marya  
- Numbers: aika, tera, pancha, satta, nava  
-colors: pingar\[l\]a, babhru, par\[l\]ita  
- vira/shUra-based names: vIrasena, vIrya, vIryasoma vIryavAja, vIryashUra, vIrajana, avashUra, kal\[r\]mashUra, kShemashUra.  
- vAja-based names: viryavAja, sattavAja, vAjin, mativAja.  
- R^ita based names: artadhAman, artamna, artamAnya.

It is clear from whatever evidence we have that the Indo-Aryan speakers
bringing this superstrate to the middle east: 

- 1) were speakers of a language close to the vedic language. 
- 2) Followed an IE religion close to vedic 
- 3) were a heroic/military group rather than traders or pure ritualist priest (as against warrior-priests), as suggested by the numerous vAja, vIra/shUra based names. 
- 4) Were highly equestrian in disposition (The Hittite ascendency can be directly linked to adoption of IA horse training techniques like that of Kikkuli. Modern day experiments of Kikkuliâ€™s method show that it is an effective 7 month training program for war-horses).

These traces of IA are very important because they form the only clearly
attested archaeological evidence for an Indo-Aryan language prior to the
Brahmi inscriptions in India. Clearly, the form of IA language in these
texts is closer to Vedic rather than the earliest Brahmi inscriptions,
providing evidence that a language close to Vedic was spoken as a
regular language outside of ritual context around 1600-1200 BCE. Western
Indologists interpret these traces of IA as a certain sign that the Rig
Veda must be contemporaneous. They also see this is a certain sign that
from the Central Asian homeland the vedic invasion of outer Asia took
place in various directions with one branch reaching the middle east and
only imposing itself as a superstrate, whereas in India, in the milieu
of the dead Indus civilization, a branch was able to establish itself as
the principal language of North India.

The Indo-centric authors argue that Middle Eastern IA phenomenon
represents a symmetric westward outflow of IA warriors from an IVC
locale. This mirrored the movements of IA within India where the
archaeologically attested main population movements were from West to
east with shift towards Eastern IVC sites and finally to the
Ganga-Yamuna doab, and towards the South-West and South to sites in
Gujarat and beyond. The correct model remains unclear to me, though I am
actually quite willing to accept a secondary dispersal from India,
chiefly driven by kShatriyas. I also strongly suspect that this movement
of Aryans to the middle east (from wherever it started) was critical in
introducing Indo-Aryan philosophical and mathematical concepts of the
Upanishadic era to Egypt and eventually Greece.
