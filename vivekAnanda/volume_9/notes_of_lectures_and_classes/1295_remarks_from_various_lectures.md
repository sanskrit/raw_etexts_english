## REMARKS FROM VARIOUS LECTURES

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 6, pp. 209-10.)

*\[Mr. Frank Rhodehamel's random lecture notes, most of which seem to
pertain to chapter two of the Bhagavad-Gitâ\]*

"Spirituality can never be attained until materiality is gone."

The first discourse in the Gita can be taken allegorically.

"The Vedas only teach of things in nature, only teach of nature."

We are always letting sentiment usurp the place of duty, and flattering
ourselves that we are acting in response to true love.

We must get beyond emotionalism if we would be able to renounce. Emotion
belongs to the animals. They are creatures of emotion entirely.

It is not sacrifice of a high order to die for one's young. The animals
do that, and just as readily as any human mother ever did. It is no sign
of real love to do that; merely blind emotion.

We are forever trying to make our weakness look like strength, our
sentiment like love, our cowardice like courage, etc.

Say to your soul in regard to vanities, weaknesses, etc., "This does not
befit thee. This does not befit thee".
