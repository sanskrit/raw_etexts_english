## LXXIII

*To Sister Christine*

228 W. 39TH STREET  
\[NEW YORK\]

*8th Dec. '95*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am once more on American Soil and have taken lodgings at 228 W. 39,
where I begin work from Monday next. Sometime after Christmas I intend
to make a tour through Detroit and Chicago.

I do not care for public lecturings at all — and do not think I shall
have any more public lectures charging admission. If you will see Mrs.
Phelps and others of our friends and arrange some classes (strictly on
nonpayment basis), it will facilitate things a good deal.

Write at your earliest opportunity and give Mrs. Phunkey \[Funke\] and
all our friends my deepest love and gratitude.

Yours ever in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Kripananda is over full of praise of you and Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\]
and sends his loving regards for you.
