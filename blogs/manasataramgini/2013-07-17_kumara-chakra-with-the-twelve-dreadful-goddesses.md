title = "kumAra chakra with the twelve dreadful goddesses"

+++
The account of the mantra practice of these kaumAra goddesses was
originally intended as part of the great skanda vrata. Given that that
might take a while to complete, and that these goddess might be
worshiped in other rites in different contexts, it is separately
described here.

The worship of kumAra in the circle of twelve dreadful goddesses might
be done as part of pediatric pacifications or for victory in battles.
The great kumAra is invoked in the middle of a circle of these goddess.
First the oblations are made to kumAra, followed by those to the twelve
goddesses.

He makes at least one oblation with the following offerings to kumAra:  
milk, curds, bean-rice, cakes, sesame seeds, ground mung beans, red
kidney beans, sweet syrup, cooked goat/sheep meat, beer and fruit jam.

If he desires to perform the rite for medical reasons he uses the
mantra:  
vyAdhiM hara mahAbAho mahAbhaya-vinAshana |  
prasanno deva-senAni vikalaM trAhi rogiNaM huM phaT svAhA ||

If he desires victory against his foes he offers with:  
OM shatrUn jahi kuru kuru kushalaM\! aghorAya mahAghorAya nejameShAya
namo huM khaT phaT mR^it svAhA ||

He visualizes kumAra with 6 head and 12 arms holding the usual weapons.
In the pediatric ritual he visualizes the one face as being that of a
goat.
