spectrum formed by the first 200 zeros on the critical line of the
Riemann zeta function: The Re(s)=.5 while the lines of the spectrum
above are the values of Im(s) producing the zeros. These values were
obtained from Odlyzko’s[ table of
zeroes](http://www.dtc.umn.edu/%7Eodlyzko/zeta_tables/index.html).

Many years ago when we were still not seized by the grAhI, we sat beside
a pond in which the then arrogant sachiva of the third hero was raging
like an untamed bull. Since he was a mathematician had held placed some
books on the shore, which he lent to me to glance at. I was far from
being a mathematician but it introduced me to few 1-dimensional
distributions or spectra that greatly fascinated me:  
1\) the prime distribution; 2) the distributions of zeros on the
critical line of the Riemann Zeta function; 3) the distribution of
eigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix.

There was something primal about these spectra–some thing hidden that
fascinates a layman and mathematician alike. All this suddenly struck a
new chord again, when ekanetra told me of Wigner’s conjecture that the
distribution of real spectral lines in the nuclear orbitals could be
explained as the eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix.

It brought up the fundamental question: Is the hidden Hermitian matrix
or operator behind all these something profound, or semi-trivial like
the normal distribution or the power-law in the nature of things.
