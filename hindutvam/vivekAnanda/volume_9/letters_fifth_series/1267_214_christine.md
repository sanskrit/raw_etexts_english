*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR, DIST. HOWRAH,

*23rd January 1902*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

By this time you must have settled your plans. Don't worry, however, on
my account. I only want to see you rested and well rested, wherever you
be.

Excuse this rather long delay in writing. Owing to various reasons I
could not, but \[was\] mentally sending you good wishes all along.

Miss \[Josephine\] MacLeod has arrived with her Japanese friends: Mr.
Okakura \[Kakuzo\], a professor of art, and Mr. Hori, a Brahmachârin.
The latter has come to India to study Sanskrit and English. The former
came to see India, the Motherland of Japanese culture and art. Well,
Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull and Nivedita are also expected in a few days. As it
seems now, this whole party is going to Japan — minus Nivedita. She
remains here to work.

Now, I am going to try my hand in Japan and, if possible, in China. Oh,
how I wish you were coming with Nivedita to make one of the party to
Japan! Yet, do not put yourself to unnecessary trouble for that. There
is Japan, and there is the U.S., after all, where we meet. You will only
break yourself in trying to "hustle up". No Hurry, No Worry. I am rather
anxious in not hearing from you for weeks. I pray you are not ill,
anyway.

To Mother have I given you over. She protects Her own, ever and ever, I
have no fear.

With all love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.
