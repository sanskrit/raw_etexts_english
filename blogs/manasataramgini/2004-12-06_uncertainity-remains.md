Seeing that our foes had not fired the expected salvos, we were growing
curious like the legendary cat. There was a heated discussion amongst
our staff whether to counter-attack or lie and wait. While we had gained
an advantage on front \#3, a counter-attack could prove costly, as our
resources had run out. Towards night I could not bear the wait and
ordered a cautious counter-attack. The hostile forces behaved unusually.
At first they put up a strong fight and then retreated into inaccessible
terrain. We stopped pursuing at the point, for even a victory could
prove empty and costly. It is possible they are hiding something and
have a plan to strike us unexpectedly. Today again we sent a
reconnaisance force to probe their actions. They retreated quickly after
a brief encounter. We have now decided to wait and watch though we are
not certain of their ploys in battle.
