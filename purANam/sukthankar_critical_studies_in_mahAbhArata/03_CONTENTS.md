FOREWORD^


An elaborate introduction containing a comprehensive account of the
manuscript material as also a detailed discussion of the principled Of Maha-
bharata textual criticism will be published with the last fascicule of the
Adiparvan. The following cursory remarks are intended merely to guide the
reader meanwhile through the labyrinth of a very complicated' apparatus
criticus.


GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

In the Mahabharata manuscript tradition, perhaps as much as in any
literary tradition, the textual critic is faced with a bewildering profusion of
versions as well as an amazing mixture of versions. Divers elements have
been working from the earliest times in favour of the development of different
types, on the one hand : on the other hand, there were not wanting elements
that operated against the evolution of sharply differentiated types. To un-
derstand the phenomenon of this luxuriant growth and indiscriminate fusion
of versions, one must appreciate clearly certain details of historical moment,
certain special factors in the transmission of the Mahabharata — traits which
distinguish our work from every other known text except the Ri^ayana and
possibly the Homeric epopees. Notwithstanding the fact that we know so
little that is certain and definite about the early history of the text, we may,
it seems to me, with confidence assume that after its composition the great
epic was for centuries handed down (in differing forms and sizes) from bard
to bard merely by word of mouth. It is moreover extremely probable that
even after the te'xt had been written down, large portions of it, especially
such portions as were popular, continued to be committed to memory, by
itinerant raconteurs for purposes of recitation. It is further easy to believe
that no great care was lavished on the text by these custodians of the tradi-
tion to guard it against partial corruption and elaboration or against ar-
bitrary emendation and normalization : to reproduce the received text with
any great precision would be neither attempted by these bards nor required
of them. It was then inevitable that the protean oral tradition should in
one form or another react on the written tradition and vice versa. One im-
portant and necessary consequence of such antecedents as these is the im-
possibility of retracing all extant versions to any fixed and authentic arche-
type ; since some of the modern editions could not but be descendants of
fluctuating oral versions reduced to writing in some distant past, indepen-
dently of each other, at different epochs and in different circumstances. In

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MANUSCRIPTS
AND THEIR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP

An important advance made in the classification of the manuscripts
is the separation of archetype K (which represents Devanagari transcripts
of the Kasmiri or North-western version) from other so-called Devanagari
versions. The affinity of K is documented by the? following agreements :

1. 1. 2* : K { except Ki ) Du the rest ( inclusive of Ki )

1. 1. 8 ; K ; Vi the rest ^ or

1. 1. 49^ : K Vi Bi m ; the rest or

1. 1. 51* : K Vi the rest

1. 1. 192^^ : K ( except Ke ) the rest ( inch Kc )

1. 2. 23* : K ( except Ki.e) mm; the rest ( incl. Ki.q )

1. 2. 76^ : K ( Ks missing ) N 2 f; the rest

Only Ko 1 represent archetype K in a comparatively pure form. Next
to these in purity stands Kg ; while K 3.6 are nothing but misch-codices, K 3
being conflated with the vulgate and K 4 .^ with some Southern version (cf.
1. 1. 26 and 22*, 25*). Ko i contains a text which is shorter and more archaic
      than either the Bangali or the £ 5 } vulgate.'' It is worthy of note that while
      these two manuscripts (K'o.i) have more readings in common with manus-
      cripts of the Southern recension than either of the two latter groups, yet
      they contain not a single “ additional " line which could be considered as a
      characteristic Southern interpolation. — ^Vi stands, as is to be expected, nearest
      to the Bangali version, but it is noteworthy that in a few cases and K
      agree in opposition to all other manuscripts, where it is impossible to consider
      the agreement as purely accidental (cf. 1. 1. 8 , 49'U . — The BangMi version
      is slightly superior to the “vulgate," in so far that it is not interpolated quite
      so heavily as the latter. Bangali omits (like K) not only the Brahma-Gaaiesa
      episode in the first adhyiaya, but (unlike K) also the’ short dialogfle between
      Paraiurama and his ancestors in the second, both unquestionably spurious
      and both found in the “vulgate." Occasionally Bangiali manuscripts agree
      with Southern manuscripts in opposition to K and the “ vulgate (cf. 1 . I.
      22^, 42^). In these cases I have adopted as authentic the concordant read-
      ings of the Bangali and Southern manuscripts in preference to those of K.
      Bangali alone has in a few; cases preserved the correct reading as compared
      with all the other manuscripts (cf. 1. 1. 62^). — Closely connected with the
      Bangali is the version of Arjunami^ra. It not only agrees with the Bangali
      in the omission of the Brahma-Gaijesa episode and of the dialogue mentioned

above, but it shares with the Bangali quite a number of isolated readings
against all other; manuscripts. The (epic) text in the Arjunamisra codices
is frequently contaminated from the “ vulgate ” and has to be corrected with
the help of Arjunamisra’s commentary (cf. 1. 1. 17^, 22^). — Ratnagarbha’s
text is eclectic, standing palpably under the influence of the Southern recension
(cf. 24*, 25*, 27*). — Nilakaintha’s version (which may conveniently be styled
the “vulgate’’) presents a smooth text, with an inconsiderable amount of
Southern element. It may be noted that in rare cases the Bombay edition
(of Ganpat Krsnaji) contains readings which have’ no manuscript support at
all or have at best very weak manuscript support. — Next we have the mixed
Devanagari group represented by misch-codices of small trustworthiness

and of no special value for critical purposes. contain a very large num-

ber of old readings in common with manuscripts of the K group, but D 14
shows at the same time some Southern readings and some unique readings
not found elsewhere (cf. 1 . 1 . 50^, 63'’'^ ; 2 . lOV^). D 9.32 palpably under
the influence of the Southern tradition. — Telugu manuscripts have been placed
in the Southern recension, but they belong in a sense to both recensions ; they
are eclectic on no recognizable principles. — It is difficult to define precisely
the' relationship between the Grantha and the Malayalam versions, which are
very closely allied ; each of them exhibits nevertheless certain features not
found in the other (cf. 1 . 1 . 184"^). On the whole* the Grantha version pro-
duces the impression of being less interpolated and more archaic than the
other. This version has two sub-groups, G^^^ and » numerous cross-
agreements between the two sub-groups show that our manuscripts are con-
flated. G 7 does not belong to dther of these groups ; in point of fact, it is
a misch-codex contaminated! from the Northern tradition and closely allied
to T^ (cf. 1. 1. 63, 64), — often stands in antagonism to M 2 - 4 , sometimes
agreeing with manuscripts of the Northern recension (cf. 1. 1. 32^"^, 4P^, 7P,
128"). The Southern recension, as already remarked, agrees with archetype
K more closely than with any other Northern version.

£ 6 } The Southern version of the first two adhyayas is on the whole shorter
than the “ vulgate ” ; but the shortest version of these two adhyayas is
that preserved by Ko.t, Ko being probably even shorter than K^. The' naive
Brahma-Gnpesa episode, the longest as well as the most obvious interpolation
in the text of the' “ vulgate ”, has been relegated to the Appendix (cf. 1. 1. 26,
53, 60, 62, 64). Its spuriousness has now been placed beyond the domain
of sane criticism through its absence in Ko.a B Da D, In the South-
ern manuscripts (and in some conflated Devanagari manuscripts) Brahma
alone is introduced ; in these there is no talk of Gane^a, who is unquestionably
a late Northern intruder. The yaddsrausam section is also evidently an in-
terpolation, but a considerably older one. Being merely a string of stanzas
summarizing some of the most important incidents and episodes of the epic,
it lent itself easily to being further interpolated by revisers who wanted to



FOREWORD

supply the omissions and thus make the summary as complete as possible.
To present the oldest form of this section now recoverable, I have deemed
it sufficient to accept as genuine only such stanzas as are found verbatim in
both the recensions. Here again Ko.j have the fewest interpolations. The
table of contents” in the second adhyiaya is preserved in two versions, a
longer and a shorter. Ko.i S (except G 7 ) have the' shorter version, which
has been adopted in the constituted text as the authentic one.

Since I have not been able to discover any traces of “ secondary interrela-
tionship” between archetypes K and S, I consider the agreement between
these two archetypes as “primitive”, that is depending upon their primitive
connection through the Ur-Mahabharata. This concord is a factor of supreme
importance for the reconstruction of the text. The originality of the agree-
ment is established, in my opinion, by the following considerations. The con-
cordant readings of K and S repre?sent as often as not a lectio difficilior' (cf.
1 . 1. 19^, 94'^ 158^). Frequently such a reading best explains the other vari-
ants (cf. 1. 1. 1 . 14^0- Furthermore the “additional” stanzas which are

found in the “ vulgate* ” but are missing in K and S have all the appearance
of being interpolations, lengthening and weakening the text (cf. 19*, 29*, 35*-
38) ; the same remark applies to the additional stanzas that are found in
    the Southerrs recension but are missing in K and the “vulgate*” (cf. 21*,
    22*, 27*). The high position of K seems confirmed by its being the shortest
    of the known versions.


THE CONSTITUTED TEXT

In preparing the constituted text of the first two adhyiayas, I have endea-
voured to balance the eclecticism advocated in certain matters with a rigid
conservatism insisted on in others. I have been most averse to reject or cor-
rect the readings of good manuscripts. Interpretation has throughout been
given precedence over emendation ; in the first two adhyayas, no emendation
seemed absolutely necessary, nor any absolutely certain. Solecisms, when
shewn to be original by a clear agreement on this point between (what ap-
peared to be) independent versions, have been allowed to stand uncorrected
(cf. 1. 1. 5.^, 170'0. As a general rule, preference is given to a reading which
best suggests how other readings might have arisen. When such a reading
was not available the choice fell upon one which is common to (what prima
facie appeared to be) more or less independent versions and which is support-
ed by intrinsic probability ; the presumption of originality in such cases is fre-
quently confirmed by a lack of definite agreement between the dis-£ 7 }-cordant
versions. Occasionally one comes across variants where the matter is identical
but thei wording of a large part or of the whole of the line is differeint ; one
and the same primitive reading cannot in these cases account for the diver-
gence. In the presence of such alternatives, neither of which can have come
from the other and which have equal Extrinsic support and equal intrinsic



FOREWORD


merit, the criteria mentioned above fail to give a (positive result. A particular
instance of the variation contemplated here is that of a puzzling form of a
cross-agreement between the Northern and Southern versions ; when, for in-
stance, some Kasmiri and Malayalam manuscripts agree in opposition to say,
Bangali and Grantha (cf. 1. 1. 60^). In such cases, I have, owing to the
much greater correctness of the K version, mostly adopted, as stopgaps, the
readings of Ko.i, the manuscripts which present the archetype K in a rela-
tively pure form.

I have given in the constituted text whatever in each case appeared to
be supported by the balance of probabilities, indicating all the important ele-
ments — lines, phrases, significant words and word-parts —of the text that are
less than certain by a wavy line printed below them. Insignificant differences
of spelling (e.g. Naimisa-Naimi^^) are ignored for this purpose.

Doubt which cannot be resolved by a consideration of the documentary
or intrinsic probability, entailing the use of the wavy line, arises in the follow-
ing cases : (a) when the transmitted readings appe*ar to be corrupt and no
satisfactory emendation can be suggested ; (b) when there are several read-
ings of equal merit ; in paiticular where the Northern and the Southern reces-
sions offer twb different readings of equal value ; lastly (c) when the evidence
pro et contra of documentary’' and intrinsic probability is equally balanced.

As regards interpolations, the additional lines are so ingeniously fashion-
ed and cunningly fitted in, that in any given case the intrinsic evidence is
generally inconclusive. In other words, if we leave out of account the docu-
mentary evidence, no convincing proof can in general be brought forward to
establish either the originality or the spuriousness of the added lines. We
cannot, however, entirely ignore the e'vidence of tradition. Everything points
to the fact that what the epic has suffered from is inflation and elaboration,
and not depletion or curtailment. On principle, therefore, lines that are/ pecu-
liar to one recension, having nothing whatsoever corresponding to them, at the
same point, in the other recension, are to be/ viewed with grave suspicion.
Unless there is overwhelming evidence to prove their originality, they should
be treated as spurious ; because, the probability of error is far greater in ad-
mitting as authentic such one-recension lines on insufficient evidence of ori-
ginality (fcKjjth recensions being placed on an equal footing and treated with
impartiality) than in rejecting them on insufficient evidence of spuriousness.
It may be added that the presumption of unauthenticity is frequently confirm-
ed by the fact that in the recension in which such lines do occur, they are
found inserted' in different manuscripts (or different versions) at different
points of the text.


I am greatly indebted to Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Chief of Aundh,
for uniform kindn’ess and courtesy ; but still more for the absolute confidence he is
pleased to repoise in me. I must also record my thanks, for help of various kinds, to

my colleagues on the Mahabharata £8} Editorial Board : Prof. Vaijnath K. Rajvade,
M.A, ; Mr. Vishwanath P. Vaidya, bar-at-daw ; Prof. I>r. R. Zimmermann, S.J.,
PH.D. ; Prof. Dr. V. G. Paranjpe, m.a., d.litt. ; and Mr. N. B. Utgikar, m.a.
But I desire to make a special mention of my indebtedness to Mr. Vaidya and to
Rev. Fr. Zimmermann, whose advice and ready help have accompanied my labours
from the time I first accepted the responsibilities of the work. Nothing has en-
couraged me more in this arduous and fascinating task than the unwavering interest
with which they have followed it. In connection with the help the Editorial Board
has' received from collaborators outside the Institute, I have to record the indebted-
ness of the Bolard to : Pandit Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya, m.a.,. Principal of the
Visvabharati, Bolpur ; Rajaguru Pandit Hemraj, Ehrector of Public Instruction,
Nepal ; M. R. Ry. Sambamurti Row, Honorlary Secretary, Palace Library, Tanjore ;
and Prof. K. Rama Pisharoti, m.a.. Principal of the Sanskrit College, Trippunit-
tura. Cochin. These gentlemen have been good enough to supply the Institute with
carefully prepared collations of manuscripts which are in their charge or which were
kindly procnjced for the purpose by them. The Nirnaya Sagar Pres's has rendered
ungrudgingly every assistance in carrying out the typographical anangements which
appeared to me best suited for the purposes of the work. The illustration accom-
panying this fascicule is prepared from a w'ater-cdjlour painting kindly supplied by
the Chief of Aundh.


In conclusion, I may be permitted to remark that the renown of the
Bharatavar^a; of its Princes and its People, is for all time inseparably linked
with the' Mahabharata, which is, in more senses than one the greatest epic the
world has produced. It must be manifest to anyone who bestows a thought
on the' subject that the monumental work of preparing the first critical edition
of this colossal encyclopaedia of ancient India could be carried on and com-
pleted by the young Institute by which it has been undertaken only if it can
count upon substantial aid from other sources and upon co-operation on a
much wider scale'. If the Princes and the People of India were to associate
themselves with this imposing enterprise, they would indeed be supporting
a national work. On behalf of the Institute which I represent, I appeal to
all true Indians to ally themselves with the Institute in supporting the publi-
cation of a work which is in a unique manner bound up with the history of
the Indian pePple and the prestige of Indian scholarship.

POSTCRIPT

Since the manuscript of this fascicule was sent to the press, I was able
to make arrangements for securing collations of Sarada and! Nepali manuscripts
of the Adiparvan. These collations will be published later. Here it may just
be' remarked that the collations so far received wholly support the constituted
text, especially as regards the interpolated stanzas, proving the correctness of
the method adopted in setting the text.
