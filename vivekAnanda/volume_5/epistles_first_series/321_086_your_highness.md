## LXXXVI

MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH DIST., BENGAL,  
*26th October, 1898*.

YOUR HIGHNESS, (Maharaja of Khetri.)

I am very very anxious about your health. I had a great desire to look
in on my way down, but my health failed completely, and I had to run
down in all haste. There is some disturbance with my heart, I am afraid.

However I am very anxious to know about your health. If you like I will
come over to Khetri to see you. I am praying day and night for your
welfare. Do not lose heart if anything befalls, the "Mother" is your
protection. Write me all about yourself. . . . How is the Kumar Saheb?

With all love and everlasting blessings,

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
