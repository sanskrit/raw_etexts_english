title = "bhAskara and differential calculus"

It is fair to state that bhAskara provides a clear description of the
concept of the differential. This can be seen in his treatise siddhAnta
shiromaNi (chapter gaNitAdhyAya; section gatisphuTiprakaraNa). He
clearly states that this is a formalization of the approximate formulae
given by the earlier AchArya brahmagupta.

He defines two quantities: 1) sthulagati (roughly speed) that is defines
as ratio of the distance travelled by a object to the time taken for
that.  
  
2\) sukShmagati or tatkAlikI gati. This the one used to define velocity
of an object. It defined as the value obtained by taking the time
duration to be an infinitesmal, which is given the technical term
pratikshaNaM. This is evident from the formula he gives for the
calculation of the sine tables because he is assuming the tatkAlikI gati
of sin(x) to be cos(x)
