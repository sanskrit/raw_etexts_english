+++
The birth anniversary of the dark hero of the yadus dawned. We decided
to  
recall his awful deeds in course of his momentous life that overlapped
with the tumult taking place in the bhArata realms.  
\-The yadu was born to vasudeva and devakI, who were imprisoned by
kaMsa, devakI’s brother.The tyrant kaMsa had been told that devakI’s 8th
son will kill him one day.  
\-devakI’s eighth son was born on a rohiNI aShtTami, and was spirited
away by vasudeva to his cowherd friend nanda’s abode. Instead he brought
back nanda’s daughter to replace his son.  
\-kR^iShNa devakIputra’s possible escape still worried kaMsa so he sent
a demoness putanA to slay devakIputra. But kR^iShNa slew pUtana
instead.  
\-kR^iShNa then still a child slew effortlessly demons such as
triNavarta, aghAsura and dhenuka. -kR^iShNa then subdued the nAga chief
kaliya on the banks of the yamuna.  
\-kR^iShNa’s brother balabhadra, son of rohiNi and vasudeva slew the
demon pralamba.  
\-devakIputra then killed the agents of kaMsa like shankachuda, ariSTa,
keshi and vyoma.  
\-then kR^iShNa and balarAma proceeded to the court of kaMsa, at
akrUra’s invitation.  
\-then the brother advanced to the capital of kaMsa, mathura, and were
pitted against the wrestlers chANUra and muShTika, whom they promptly
slew.  
\-then kR^iShna killed kaMsa by suddenly attacking him and restored
ugrasena on the throne In course of his varied career the mighty bowman
vAsudeva killed a number of powerful adversaries of the yadus. He
successively destroyed, after killing kaMsa, kAlayavana, naraka the king
of pragjyotiSha and his general mura, paundraka the false vAsudeva,
jarAsandha via pANDava bhima, shishupAla during the rAjasUya of
yuddhiShThira, shalva the great invader, dantavakra and vidhuratha.
