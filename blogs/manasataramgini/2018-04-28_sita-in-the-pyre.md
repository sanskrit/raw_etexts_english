title = "Sītā in the pyre"

+++
It was quiet, early Saturday evening. Vidrum, Jukuta, Sharvamanyu and
Lootika were hanging out on the parkway of Somakhya’s house. They had
assembled there for some curricular preparation on differentiation.
Somakhya and Lootika had covered the chain rule and the differentiation
of product functions. Buoyed up the lessons their classmate-students
felt that they could sally forth for the impending tests with
confidence. But Somakhya put the damper on them: “Differentiation is the
easy part and one can rake up the marks on the exam like
[Gandulkar](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/12/06/of-lives-of-men-of-times-of-men-iii/)
smashing sixes off the Rainbow Republic bowlers. The real challenges
will come with the rising balls of integration.”

Lootika amplified the matter like an accompanying musician: “If you
think you have mastered math, remember this tale in  Greek tradition: it
was said that there was a mortal named Stentor who could yell with the
voice of many men in unison. But once he attempted to contest with the
god Hermes on hearing whose loud yell he died. Thus, when the
integration section opens you may come up against some Hermesian howlers
that our classmate Hemaling spends all day integrating.”  
Somakhya: “In any case we will cover that tomorrow along with some
vectors.”

Vidrum flipping through the news and messages on his tablet chimed in:
“I see some very disturbing news. A city man, Durjoy, has been
arrested on the charges of trying to arrange aid to the socialist
terrorists who have been trapped as part of the ongoing operation in
Gondipura. Our classmate Manjukeshi who was supposedly taking
preparatory lessons from him at that time has also been taken into
custody\!”  
Sharvamanyu: “Good job by the security forces.”  
Jukuta checking out the news herself: “That is really sad. Was this
Durjoy the senior student from the St. Stephens institution? He would
come to hangout outside our school and was quite good to me in those
days. I do not know if was really involved in anti-national activities.
But it is ridiculous on their part to arrest Manjukeshi. I believe she
should be innocent.”  
Lootika: “I think he was a lout. One day he accosted me outside school
but I scampered away on my bike in fear, thinking he might be an acolyte
of
[Shonit](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2015/11/19/the-autumn-days/)
who had harassed me and my sisters in our former school. But Sharva got
some interesting “stones”, from him, which he apparently found in
Gondipura and gifted them to me. They turned out to be the fossil eggs
and an ungual of the peculiar sauropod dinosaur Isisaurus ”  
Sh: “Remember, he was always trying to seduce girls from our school. He
left those fossils with me during an inter-school athletics event and
never took them back. Then I gave them to you knowing you might find
them interesting. Why do you think he was in Gondipura? I am sure it was
not for dinosaur-hunting.”  
Lootika: “Of course, now all that makes sense. I’d add Manjukeshi may
not be innocent either.”  
Vidrum: “Why do you think so? She is a nice girl. I know she was just
taking classes from that Durjoy.”  
Somakhya: “Vidrum, have you forgotten [the day you first introduced her
to us](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/07/28/nalika-s/). She
did strike us as a fighter for social justice. After all let’s not
forget she used assemble for these lessons of ours whole of last
semester. Until., well…I guess let it be.”  
Jukuta: “I never really understood why she stopped coming. Somakhya
don’t kill me for this, but she simply told me that Lootika was a
horrible person. She added that despite being a girl, she was
perpetuating gender stereotypes and horrible casteism. I tried to tell
her that even though in school I had more than one tiff with Lootika, we
are now grown up and in college and need to accept that she is truly
brighter than all the girls in our class. She cut me off saying that I
was either with her or with Lootika.”  
Lootika: “But Jukuta you have not stopped on playing on both sides,
right? Let me remind you we are under no obligation to have you here for
these lessons.”  
Vidrum: “Calm\! Let us not get into one of those silly fights of you
girls.”  
Sharvamanyu: “I think it began with that article on the Rāmāyaṇa, which
Manjukeshi authored for the college magazine, where she accused emperor
Rāma of being a male chauvinist and a casteist. We castigated her for
that and she got angry with Lootika for not supporting her silliness.”

Jukuta: “I did read that article. I don’t know much about the Ramāyaṇ,
but if that incident of letting Sītā burn is in the book it does sound
awful, like a dowry death by burning, you see. Lootika, I know you and
your sisters are the only girls who know these things written by
Brahmins in Sanskrit. Is it really there in the book?”  
Lootika: “Jukuta, before anything else you must pronounce the Rāmāyaṇa
correctly – repeat after me. When my parents first told me the tale,
they left out this part. But then, when I read it myself, in order to
narrate it to my sister Vrishchika, I encountered it right there in the
original. I must confess I read that part with some tension, as to what
was going to happen, and even surprise. It did not feel right to me then
and I asked my mother about it. She gave me the explanation that Rāma
was an avatāra of the god Viṣṇu and that the avātāra ended the moment he
performed the superhuman task of killing the rakṣas-lord. Thus, beyond
that point he behaved like an ordinary human and the act must be
understood in that light. I then asked my father about it. He said that
when Sītā was abducted by Rāvaṇa, the real Sītā was taken away by the
gods and replaced by a māyā Sītā. As per his interpretation, at the time
of the fire ordeal, the god Agni incinerated the māyā Sītā and returned
the real Sītā to Rāma. So clearly, that incident was seen as bit unusual
and rather than accept it without a question, people have come up with
different explanations for it.”

Jukuta: “But Lootika at the bottom-line would that still not be
misogynistic, as Manjukeshi had written?”  
Lootika: “See, such words are neologisms, which make little sense in the
context of old tradition. As a biologist I have learned not be fall prey
to such emotionalistic constructs but coldly look at the hard realities
on the ground. The sexes are always pitted in an inter-sexual conflict
for maximizing their fitness. At same time, as we are eukaryotes, sex is
institutionalized in us starting with the duplication into two paralogs
of the ancient protein RecA and the HORMA protein acquired from bacteria
more than 2.7 billion years ago. Like all other sexually reproducing
organisms, we cannot make more copies of ourselves without the other
sex. Hence, the games played by the players in this conflict should not
be given any moralistic judgment. That said, if you read the original
text, there is hardly anything of the kind the puerile Manjukeshi read
in it. In fact, it can be read as not disallowing the option of her kind
of unregulated sexuality: after all Rāma tells Sītā is that she can
chose any other mate she wants. So she is offered unfettered agency in
the sexual domain and it is she who chooses to remain in the union with
Rāma by proving her chastity via undergoing the ordeal by fire.
Moreover, you see her not caving in but giving a dignified and firm
public defense of her character when it was attacked and this you can
take from a brāhmaṇī who has actually read the text in the original
language.”  
Sharvamanyu: “Look at it from Rāma’s perspective too. There was a direct
affront on his manliness as a warrior in the abduction of Sītā and he
avenged it squarely. However, no man likes to be in doubt of his
paternity or risk providing for his enemies’ offspring. Therefore, he
had very natural reasons to be uneasy in accepting his wife who had been
taken into his enemy’s custody for a while…”  
Somakhya: “See, this discussion we are having here is one of the reasons
for epic’s author to craft such a tale. Even though the Rāmāyaṇa, unlike
our national epic the great Bhārata, is one of ideals, it has all these
elements that bring out the grey shades of real life. If it were not for
these, people would have had difficulty in having a discourse on dharma
of the type as we are just having. When it comes to the knotted
questions of dharma there are no black and white answers but only a
difficult navigation though the shades in the grey zone. Incidents like
this provide the framework for thinking about that path. But then the
great bhārgava does not put things in the epic without a deeper
metaphor, which only some grasp.”  
Vidrum: “What is that deeper metaphor that you are alluding to? Does
such exist in this particular incident?”  
Somakhya: “It does. But I’d let this spidery girl expound it if she
wishes as it concerns her ancestors.”

Lootika: “It was something I actually learned from Somakhya and that was
when I came to a final understanding of the incident. Everything in the
itihāsa of Valmīki is a reflection of deep elements of śruti. He has
done so in order that people like you Vidrum and Jukuta can access the
mysteries of religion that might be otherwise inaccessible. First,
remember that the princess Sītā born of the furrow in earth is
transparently the humanized form of the ancient goddess of agriculture,
who was praised by my ancestor Vāmadeva Gautama in the mantra:

arvācī subhage bhava sīte vandāmahe tvā |  
yathā naḥ subhagāsasi yathā naḥ suphalāsasi || RV 4.57.6

Be auspicious O Sītā, come come close to us. We worship you,  
such that you confer us a good share \[of things\] confer the good
fruits \[of agriculture\].

Second, my ancient clansmen, the Gotama-s, were the purohita-s of the
Videgha-s, the clan of the Janaka-s to which Sītā of the Rāmāyaṇa
belonged. Evidently, they transmitted the cult of Sītā to these kings.
The brāhmaṇa on the Sāmidheni-s, the chants by which the fire is aroused
in the śrauta rite, preserves an anachronistic ancient legend of one of
the founders of my clan, Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, and his patron the founder of
the Videha-s, Videgha Māthava. In that tale, it is said, alluding to the
Eastward migration of the Indo-Aryans, that the land the Videgha-s
eventually occupied was initially rich in water but difficult to
cultivate and habit. But when Gotama uttered an incantation, the god
Agni is said to have burst forth from Videgha Māthava’s mouth and burnt
the land of the Sadānīra river making it habitable. It is this ancient
legend that receives an epic reflection in the form of Sītā’s
purification by the fire, representing that new land of the Videha-s and
Kosala-s, along with the Gotama-s, to the east of the Kuru-Pāñchala,
becoming fit for habitation and the furrow of agriculture. Rāma who is
the earthly manifestation of the great Indra then receives that Sītā,
even as my ancestor Vāmadeva says in his incantation:  
indraḥ sītāṃ ni gṛhṇātu |  
May Indra set his hold on Sītā (set down the furrow).”  
Somakhya: “More generally, it might be seen as representing the
agricultural practice of burning leftover plant material after winter
(the grip of Vṛtra whose reflection in the epic is Rāvaņa) to get the
fields ready for agriculture in spring under the fertilizing effect of
Indra.”  
Vidrum: “Interesting, but I guess such arcana might be beyond the lay
user of the epics who might be satisfied with the social debate you
brought up earlier.”  
Lootika: “Of course this is mostly for the those who uphold the deeper
language of tradition but we are just giving you a flavor of how
overloaded the language of myth can be.”

Jukuta: “But what would you say about the killing of Jambukumār, the
śūdra saint, by Śri Rām? Is that not very casteist?”  
Sharvamanyu: “Who the hell is this Jambukumār? Never come across such in
the Rāmāyaṇa.”  
Lootika: “I believe she is referring to Śambuka.”  
Vidrum: “That is a tough one. What would you guys say.?  
Somakhya: “Again, not reading the original but going by the words of
these social justice types can give you a wrong impression. Of course,
it is a long story and we could sit here arguing both sides. for a
while, like all these thorny points in the epic. Would you really like a
story without such shades of grey, the tensions they create and the
emotions they arouse? On the other hand there are at least three
messages here. First, this Śambuka was a śūdra alright but he was not
saint. He was aiming to ascend to and conquer the world of the gods,
like the demon Rauhiṇa; hence, it was imperative that their
representative on earth Rāmacandra Aikṣvākava nip such attempts in the
bud. Remember that in the early days with the Ārya-s settled in the
subcontinent of the Jambudvipa what was meant by śūdra was some kind of
enemy of the Ārya-s. Overtime they were defeated and absorbed into Ārya
society. This leads to the second message – it is actually one
reflecting this social accommodation and change. The text clearly
states: bhaviṣyac chūdra-yonyāṃ hi tapaścaryā kalau yuge || It presents
a doctrine that successively over the four yuga-s each varṇa acquired
the capacity to do tapas. Now this Śambuka was doing it out of turn in
the previous yuga and hence he was punished for breaking the rules.
However, in a positive message it indicates that in our yuga the śūdra
has this option and the incident merely refers to the tensions of a
bygone era. Thus, in the typical futuristic format of the purāṇa-s, the
text is presenting this change in social reality vis-a-vis the śūdra
against the background of the previous antagonism. Third, it delivers
the message of conservatism for social change. Rapid social change by
accommodation of those from without the fold presents dangers. Such
elements are represented by Śambuka, who wish to emulate Ārya practices,
not for good purposes, but for conquering the daiva realm. Hence, such
revolutionary tendencies have to be suppressed in favor more gradual
accommodation over the yuga.”

Jukuta: “Your uncompromisingly conservative outlook amazes me.”  
Lootika: “You may appreciate it more as you age, though part of it is in
the genes and we cannot do much about it. But whether you like our
message or not remember that a love for facile, feel-good messages might
turn you into a Durjoy, a Shonit or a Samikaran, who in the end might do
more harm than good to society.”  
Sharvamanyu: “And now Jukuta I hope you don’t bring up the issues of
animal rights in the incident of the killing of Vālin.”  
Jukuta: “Who is Vālin?”  
Lootika: “The next time we assemble at my house I’ll gift you a
bāla-Rāmāyaṇa. I really think you need to be reading it more than any
of this curricular stuff.”
