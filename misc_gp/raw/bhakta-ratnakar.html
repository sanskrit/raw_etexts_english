<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Devotee-Madhavdasji</p>
<p class="Text">Madhavdasji was a Kanyakubj Brahman. In his householder life, he earned a lot of wealth and property. He was an eminent scholar and a righteous devotee. When his devoted wife departed for the heaven, abruptly the sentiment of dispassion from this world was created in his heart. Considering this world unsubstantial, he abandoned his house and family and set out for Jagannathpuri. Reaching there, he remained lying on the beach of the sea at a secluded place and remained absorbed in the Lord’s meditation. He absorbed his mind in the Lord so deeply that he became unconscious of taking even food and water. Such is the effect of love. Thus, a number of days in his meditation passed without meal and water; then, the kind-hearted Lord Jagannathji could not bear to see him thus, remaining hungry. He, at once, commanded Subhadraji to reach His devotee, Madhav, herself, with the richest meal placed in the golden salver. On the Lord’s command Subhadraji reached Madhavdasji with the rich items of food well placed in a golden salver. On reaching there, She found Madhav absorbed in meditation so deeply that he was unaware of even Her arrival there. She saw that he was absorbed in the meditation of the Lord’s charming image; so thinking it improper to interrupt his meditation She, too, came back having placed the salver there. When Madhavdasji came to consciousness from his deep meditation, he began to shed the tears of joy to see the golden salver with rich items of food realizing it the Lord’s grace. He offered food to his deity, took the food himself and placed the salver aside; and again got himself absorbed in the meditation.</p>
<p class="Text">On the otherside, when the Lord’s shutter was opened, the priests created a great fuss not to get the golden salver. The searchout was started to be made throughout Puri. In the course of search the flat golden salver was found lying with Madhavdasji. Enough it was, considering Madhavdasji a thief, he was being lashed. Madhavdasji endured the suffering smiling. In the night the priests saw the horrible dream. The Lord said in the dream—‘I took the entire injury of Madhav on My ownself, now, I will ruin you completely, otherwise, go and falling down on his feet get yourselves pardoned for your crime.’ The poor Pandas reached Madhavdasji running fast and fell down on his feet. Madhavdasji, at once, pardoned them and made them fearless. Forgiveness and kind-heartedness of the devotees is but natural.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, Madhavdasji reached such a state of emotion in love that whenever he visited the temple to get the Lord’s sight, he used to remain gazing the Lord’s idol without a wink. After the visit was over, he used to be invisible to the priests remaining stood there in the state of being absorbed.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, he happened to suffer from dysentery. He went far away on the sea-shore, there he grew so feeble that he found himself unable to stand and sit properly. In such a condition Jagannathji, Himself, began to attend him in his service. When Madhavdasji came to his consciousness, he, at once, recognised and became confident that it was the Lord, Himself. Having come to know this, he hastely caught His feet and began to say in very humble words of his pathetic emotion—‘Lord! Why did you take so much trouble for such a mean person like me? And in addition to this You are omnipotent. Why did You not use Your Power in giving me relief from sorrow, why did You Yourself take so much trouble? The Lord began to state—‘Madhav! I am unable to bear the suffering of My devotees, I don’t find any other one better than I, myself, worthy of their service. That is why, I, Myself, served you. You are well known with the fact that whatever is allotted by destiny, is blotted out only after suffering through—this is the rule made by Myself, why should I, Myself, break it? So, I get my devotees suffer their lot according to their fate by serving them and <span class="char-style-override-3">‘योऽसौ विश्वम्भरो देव: स भक्तान् किमुपेक्षते’</span> God is the sustainer of the whole universe, how He can ignore His devotees.‘What is allotted to My devotees by the Lord Brahma they are expected to suffer their lot’. Having uttered thus, the Lord disappeared. On the other side, Madhavji, too, became free from all afflictions.</p>
<p class="Text">These events bewildered the people. Now, the glory of Madhavdasji began to spread far and wide. The people began to come round him. It is the most objectionable for a devotee to remain surrounded by the people of the worldly interest. It struck his mind that he should now become a mad. Well, now he began to move about here and there as a mad making the sound of ‘Hari’. One day, he reached the door of a woman and begged for alms. At that time that woman was busy in sweeping her kitchen; getting agitated she threw the sweeping cloth mixed with clay on his face. Being very much pleased he took away that sweeping cloth at his dwelling. Having washed it cleanly and got it dried and made its wick he lighted it in the temple reaching there, as a result of which as by degrees the illumination of the wick began to spread in the temple so by the degrees the illumination of knowledge started growing in the temple of her heart. Even to the extent that woman became a great devotee in the last and began to remain immersed day and night in the Lord’s meditation.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, a great scholar of scriptures making a bid for world conquest by the discussions of the ‘Shastras’ came to Jagannathpuri to debate on the scriptures to hear the fame of Madhavji and was obstinate to make a discussion with Madhavdasji on Shastras. The devotees think that discussions on ‘Shastras’  are worthless . Madhavdasji did his best to avoid discussion on Shastras but how could the Pandit agree? At last, Madhavdas signed a sheet of paper to write on it—‘Panditji was victorious against Madhavdasji’. Panditji was puffed with joy on this conquest. At once, he started for Kashi. Having called the meeting of scholars there he began to describe about his conquest and began to show that certificate to the people. When the learned men saw they found there written as ‘Panditji was defeated and Madhav won’. Then Panditji got enraged. He returned immediately to Jagannathpuri. There he abused Madhavdasji without any restraint and said—‘He who is defeated in the discussion of ‘Shastras’ should take round of the town having mounted on the donkey duly pasted his face with black colour.’ Madhavdasji tried his best to persuade him but why should he agree? On getting interval the Lord in the disguised form of Madhavdasji reached there for the discussion about the ‘Shastras’ with Panditji and in the full open assembly defeated badly. At last, according to his stipulation, having coloured his face with black colour and got him mounted on an ass made him tour about in the town taking about one to two hundred boys along with scattering dust. When Madhavdasji heard of this situation, he rushed up and holding the Lord’s feet begged Him to forgive Panditji for his offence. The Lord disappeared immediately. Having got Panditji mounted down from the ass-back, begged him for pardon, pacified his anger. Blessed is the devotee’s endurance and kind-heartedness!</p>
<p class="Text">It was once when Madhavdasji was on his journey to Braj. On the way, a lady took him away to feed. The lady fed him with great love. At this end, Shyamsunderji began to eat food sitting beside him. The lady began to weep to see the tender form of the Lord and asked Madhavdasji—‘Lord! Who is that hard-hearted mother who sent such a handsome child with you?’ Turning his neck when Madhavdasji saw, he found that Shyamsunderji was taking food. Enough! He forgot his consciousness and praising the lady, he began to take her round. Having praised her devotional emotion and luck he departed from there. </p>
<p class="Text">There are several such examples of Madhavdasji’s character which cannot be described here due to the fear of being lengthy.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">‘Chant victory of the devotee and the Lord!’<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Devotee-Vimaltirth</p>
<p class="Text">Pt. Vimaltirth was a devout Brahman. He was a man of high character and of a pious family. Three times Sandhya (morning, noon and day-break), sacrifice with medicinal herbs and butter offered in fire (Agnihotra), self-study of Vedas and the contemplation of the spiritual truth etc., were as if the natural duty of his each and every family member. All the family members were endowed with the virtuous merits of truth, non-violence, forgiveness, mercy, modesty, non-stealing, renunciation and contentment etc., in the form of parental-property. In spite of all these merits the sentiment of devotion to the Lord as it should be, was not so accordingly. Pt. Vimaltirth was a peerless gem of this family. His mother had already died when he was a child. In his maternal house there was the scarcity of children, so his maximum time passed with his maternal mother from the very beginning of childhood. After his mother’s death his maternal mother did not agree to leave him at all, he lived with her. His maternal father, Pt. Niranjanji too, was a great learned and noble person. He got the lesson of good conduct from him and an expert teacher of the same village taught him. He was exceptionally sharp-witted. The bent of mind towards knowledge according to the family tradition was already in him. So, his teacher had not to take much pain in teaching him. He used to learn the books so easily as anyone learnt the lesson which had already been learnt by him before hand. His sacred-thread ceremony had already been got performed by his maternal father, so he observed ‘Sandhya’ (Prayer) all the three times. He made obeisance to his elders daily in the morning, obeyed their good commands conscientiously without illogical mind in turn became affectionate to all in the natural way.</p>
<p class="Text">Vimalji’s maternal mother, Sunanda Devi was a great devotee. She served her husband with the sense of Supreme Lord and besides this she had devoted her life in the service of Supreme husband, even the husband of husband, the Supreme Lord. She had firm faith in the Lord and His auspicious dispensation and so she used to remain ever cheerful in every situation. Having got such a virtuous wife, Pt. Niranjanji felt himself a blessed one. Sunanda Devi did the entire domestic chores conscientiously. But here, her feeling used to be—‘This is the Lord’s house, I have been allotted the responsibility of its service. So long as this work is on my shoulders, it is to be done properly with care. Keeping this view in her mind, she did all the chores; but she had neither in her the sense of mineness nor any attachment in the house, in the objects of the house, in the works and in the fruit of her actions. Her entire feeling of mineness and attachment had been concentrated to her God, Lord Narayan. So, whatever she did, she did her all actions for the pleasure of her Lord Shri Narayan considering His work only. By doing so she got a special joy in doing her work. There is also a pleasure in performing the works with dutiful mind, but here is not that pleasure what is in the works done for the sake of her beloved Lord’s pleasure. There is no bore at all in it, there is the experience of a peculiar taste which elates with joy and delights the lover at every step and he remains busy in doing the Lord’s work with ever new and novel zeal in natural way having dedicated his life; but the unparalleled taste of joy what he experiences in doing such a performance, its cause is not the action or its fruit, its cause is the concentrated attachment and oneness with the Lord. The Lord is not pleased with that work and wants to engage him in any other work to leave the previous work, the same pleasure will be felt by him in doing the next work also what he felt in doing the first work. Sunanda had the same sentiment of relation with her family members and she managed and did all her domestic duties with the same sentiment. Now, Sunanda loved Vimal, deprived of mother, pouring down the entire nectar of her wholehearted affection with the same feeling and brought up him thinking that he is worthy of service which has been allotted to her by the dearest Supreme  Lord. His maternal mother had a great attachment with him but this attachment was not so because Vimal was the son of her daughter but it was so because he was a charming and beautiful tree of the fruits of the Lord’s garden, who had been committed to her charge to bring up him. The maternal mother’s pure and pious affection had an indelible impact on Vimal and Vimal’s thoughts also went on developing respectively day by day like the good sense of his maternal mother. The devotedness to the Lord, the faith and devotion in the Lord and the sweet and stainless sentiment of auspicious divine acts awakened in him. He used to feel charmed to see again and again his maternal mother’s service of the Lord’s idol. He also intended to do the Lord’s service. At last, to see his true and keen desire  his maternal mother got a very beautiful Lord Narayan’s idol brought for him also by the Lord’s inspiration and Vimal  in accordence with maternal mother’s advice, began to worship the Lord with his devoted mind. </p>
<p class="Text">In the stainless lineage of Vimaltirth, each and everything was pious and stainless. The family was lacking something in the Lord’s devotion and that was also thus compensated. He who is humble and meek along with rituals, knowledge and the thought of spiritual truth, doubtlessly attains the Lord’s devotion, the supreme fruit of knowledge and truth. But where the rituals, knowledge and the reasoning of spiritual truth are egotism and vanity creating there is always downfall as the result. Basically, the rituals, the knowledge and the thoughts that, instead of leading towards the divinity, polute the innerself with the filth of vanity, are either evil deeds, ignorance or evil thoughts only. In the Vimaltirth’s family besides the rituals, knowledge and the thoughts of spiritual truth there was innate modesty and humblenes also and as a result it was essential as the creation of love and interest in the Lord. The result of virtuous deeds is always auspicious and the most auspicious is the Lord’s devotion only. By the company of the maternal mother, Sunanda there was the manifestation of the pious fruit of Vimaltirth’s stainless lineage. The maternal father and the maternal mother ceremonised the marriage of Vimaltirth with Sunayanadevi of saintly nature belonging to a pious family according to the holy Vedic rules with great enthusiasm. The daughterinlaw gifted with high characteristics came in the family. The old Sunanda’s physical energy had almost decayed, so Sunayana took the responsibility of the domestic chores and the maternal mother’s work of Thakurji’s worship on her  own shoulders. Now, the mother began to give her entire time in the Lord’s rememberance. Niranjan Pandit, too, had grown old. But his nature was most appreciating. He anchored his mind in the Lord. After some time the old couple died naturally without any disease while remembering the Lord. Usually, Vimal and Sunayana always remained engaged in the service of maternal father and the maternal mother but the virtuous couple didn’t take service lying on the bed even when diseased. Now, it was Vimaltirth who became the master of that house. The wife-husband had a deep love with each other; the both were of a very pious moral character. The both were dedicated to the Lord’s devotion. Vimal worshipped his deity regularly with great love and Sunayanadevi worshipped the Lord given by the maternal mother Sunanda. There were separate Thakurji of the wife and husband to say but the both took much pleasure in the service of Thakurji. The both remained always engaged in giving comforts to their own Lord’s as if making competition. The both had knowledge and devotion and they had the pure sentiment of service. </p>
<p class="Text">Vimaltirth had three elder brothers. They too, were of a very good nature and devoted to the auspicious deeds. The youngest brother Vimal, was now officiating their maternal uncle in one sense. There was a strong bond of mutual love and affection among them. Love decays due to selfishness; but their self-interest was of strange category. They considered their self-interest in doing special good in giving comforts and serving one-another. As regards self-denial, it was as if their paternal property. Where there is sacrifice there is love naturally and where there is love, there is abundance of recess for the presence and flourish of joy and delight. So, both the families were thus quite happy. They were two only outwardly. Basically they were one practically. </p>
<p class="Text">There was dispassion already in the mind of Vimaltirth. Gradually, it began to grow more and more. By the Lord’s grace his wife proved supporting to it. As if there was the competition of dispassion and devotion between the both. Such a pure envy is created in the mind only by the Lord’s grace. In this envy there remains race to leave each other behind and go ahead, no doubt, but there remains no attitude in the mind to restrain or to cast down each other. But reverse to it there is the feeling of pleasure in supporting each other. The energy is invested not in knocking down but in pushing up each other. This is the proper use of energy. </p>
<p class="Text">Ultimately, their indifference to the world grew and the both began to remain immersed in the Lord’s meditation. One day, the Lord became graceful and blessed Sunayanadevi with His vision and the very day, having departed from this body she reached the Lord’s Supreme abode on the Lord’s command. Vimaltirth felt a great pleasure due to this. In the competition, the wife proved winner. She was ahead in getting the Lord’s glimpse. This was the matter of great joy for Vimaltirthji. In such a holy race the looser experiences such a supernatural delight on the victory of the winner, which the selfish men of the world cannot even imagine.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, Vimaltirthji dedicated himself absolutely in the practice of spiritual exercise. Going to the forest he began to live in a secluded place and forgetting entire knowledge and intelligence he began to remain absorbed constantly in the Lord’s meditation. By and by his craving of the Lord’s sight waxed and one day this craving reached such a climax that the delay of even a moment became unbearable to him. Just like an extremely thirsty person who becomes restless and starts writhing for a single drop of water and cannot bear the delay of a single moment, similarly when a devotee reaches the similar condition for God’s vision, the delay of a single moment becomes unbearable to the Lord also at that time and having dismissed His entire majesty,  prosperity He obliges the devotee having appeared before the meek human being. Like the  divine tree Kalpataru fulfilling all the desires of His devotees the Lord Shri Narayan appeared before Vimaltirth to gratify him. He remained gazing that peculiar charming appearance without a wink. After a long delay he could gather the energy to move and speak. Then, being overwhelmed with joy he became flat to the Lord’s feet and began to wash His lotus feet with the tears of love. Having lifted him with arms the Lord embraced him to His heart very affectionately and having gifted him His exclusive devotion made him pious forever. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Applaud victory of the devotee and His Lord!<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Devotee-Mahesh Mandal</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(1)</p>
<p class="Text">Famine broke out throughout the country, there is hue and cry all around; the East Bengal is badly famine-stricken. The people are dying due to starvation. The event is related to that period. Mahesh belonged to Mandal caste, the mean lower-caste wretched. After the hard labour of the whole day he got some wages that he brought home, he maintained himself as well as his wife, son and daughter all four with that earning. He had no capital and land at all. Mahesh was the devotee of the Goddess Bhagawati, he used to repeat ‘Durga’, ‘Durga’ the whole day and night. He had a firm faith in the Goddess Durga. Mahesh never forgot to repeat the name of the goddess ‘Durga’ whatever the hardships or the horrible calamity might occur. It was famine all over the country, at such a time how could he get any work? The members of Mahesh’s family pulled on anyhow with the half of their belly-ful and sometimes they had to go on complete fast. Today was the day after two days fast; Mahesh earned six annas paise hardly anyhow. He purchased two kg. of rice from the market and reached the river bank to cross it. On the river, bank he happened to see Khepu Maharaj.</p>
<p class="Text">Khepu was the astrologer of the village. Roaming about here and there he used to foretell the result of the calendar (Panchangfal) and someone’s horoscope. On the occasion of ‘Durgapuja’ (the worship of the Goddess Durga) he portrayed the idol etc. Thus, whatever work he got he used to earn some paise by doing that work. Neither he could do any work of physical labour nor there was any fixed income. There was  cry of distress in the whole country due to famine. At such a time of calamity who would give him paise? Khepu was standing on the river bank in the pensive mood with the faded face. To see the faded face of the Brahman, Mahesh asked him—‘Are you quite well with your family?’ Khepu answered—‘What should I tell? The mother Goddess Durga has given me only ill-luck to suffer. I didn’t get even alms anywhere. Three days passed in hunger, none of my family members ate anything. On reaching home I will get all the members of my family fcing imminent death. I am sinking in this worry.’ Mahesh said—‘Who is another one except Durga to protect at the time of calamity? It is she who gives us to eat and it is she who doesn’t give anything. Our job is only to weep before the mother Durga. By crying before her the alms is sure to be got.’ Khepu said Brother! This faith has shattered. Don’t you see that I am drowning in the sea of sorrow? Now enough! The life is at the edge of death. Tell me how to sustain faith?’</p>
<p class="Text">To hear the condemnation of the mother Durga, Mahesha’s eyes were filled with tears. Mahesh said—‘Do take it, the mother Durga has sent your alms through my hands. Please, don’t weep.’ Having handed over the whole rice and pulse to Khepu, Mahesh moved towards his home cheerfully. Mahesh was considering himself as if grateful to give away the grain to Khepu. He thought—‘Today is ‘Ekadashi’. Throughout my life I never observed the vow of Ekadashi. It was ‘Dashami’ (the tenth day of the fortnight) yesterday. I ate nothing. Today passed in fast. The fast is  observed completely. If the Lord favours, it will be the break of fast tomorrow on the ‘Dwadashi’, (the twelvth day of the fortnight) positively. A single day fast will not kill me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, absorbed in thought Mahesh reached home. Just to see Mahesh his wife said coming before him—‘Make haste to give me rice so that I may prepare the rice. Probably, the child will not be saved today. He is unconscious since long due to appetite. Give me the rice, I should cook it and you should look after him. Mahesh said—‘Remembering the name of Durga drop the water into the mouth of the child. By the grace of the mother Goddess this water will prove nectar for him. The children of Khepu Maharajji are hungry for three days. If they had not got to eat today, they would have died certainly. I had two kg. of rice, I have given it to him.’ The wife of Mahesh said—‘If you had given him half and would have brought the rest half, I would have given the a handful of boiled rice to the children. The three years old child is lying unconscious without food for two days. What will happen now, it is the Goddess Durga to know.’</p>
<p class="Text">Mahesh said—‘If the mother Kali saves, who is there to kill? He will certainly survive and if the last time has approached then the separation of life is but right. The entire family of Khepu is going on hungry for three days. First, that family needs to be saved. It will happen  what is allotted to my fate.’</p>
<p class="Text">This is called sacrifice. If a man of crores donates one lakh rupees in charity only for name sake, there is no sacrifice. Neither he suffered any suffering in donation nor he could remain deprived of getting its return. His name was published in the newspapers; the title was awarded by the government and the prestige of his building enhanced more. In reality, that is sacrifice which causes hardship to self, so that is more significant. So, the Shastras state that half of the morsel is great fruitful what is given only from the morsel of the mouth. In comparison to that the charity of lakh and crores has no meaning. The sacrifice of Mahesh is much appreciable. He didn’t give only half of his mouthful, not only the full mouthful but whatever he gave was much more than anything. Own infant son is hungry for two days—he is lying unconscious due to hunger. Mahesh gave the meal of his son’s mouth to save the life of Khepu’s those children who were hungry since three days. Mahesh thought—‘My children are hungry for two days but they are hungry since three days, first, they are in more need., Mahesh is grieved for the Khepu’s children more than the grief of his own children. It is not even so that Mahesh gave the rice due to any pressure unwillingly or with displeasure. He gave happily and came home in cheerful mood and even to see his own child under the jaws of death, the cheerfulness of his action did not decrease. How blessed one!</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(2)</p>
<p class="Text">The Supreme Lord, Himself, bears the responsibility of the welfare of those who have faith in God, who know to sacrifice in the name of the Lord, who remain grateful to the Lord in joy and sorrow both in the favourable or adverse situations considering it the Lord’s blessings, considering it an auspicious, who feel gratified, who smile to see the auspicious and cheerful appearance of the Lord even in their most miserable conditions allotted by the God who cannot be deviated from their faith in the God by any hardship of life, who remember the Lord smiling cheerfully wholeheartedly with truthful mind and devotion in all the conditions on the Lord’s justice. The Lord shoulders the entire burden of such devotees. It is true—the eternal truth. We, the unfortunate men suffer sorrow after sorrow due to the lack of faith and  remain deprived of the Lord’s graceful rain. Well!</p>
<p class="Text">In the neighbourhood of Mahesh there lived a middle class householder, named Gopal Bhaumik. There was no cemented wall between their houses. Gopal and his wife both got bewildered to hear the conversation what was going on between Mahesh and his wife. Gopal said to his wife—‘It seems as if he were apparently Mahesh already. Well, who is there any such man who can go to this extent in sacrifice? As is Mahesh so is his wife exactly. Even to see the dying child, neither she expressed her rage before her husband nor any harsh word came out of her mouth. The cooked food is ready in our kitchen. Let us call them to share and make our lives blessed to serve these devotee wife and husband.</p>
<p class="Text">Gopal’s wife, Uma along with her husband reached the hut of Mahesh with the earthen cooking pots of pulse, rice and vegetables. Gopal had the bowl of milk and three to four dozens of bananas in his hands.  When they reached before Mahesh with so much items of food, Mahesh was wonderstruck to see these items and he said in surprise—‘Why this? I hadn’t expressed my desire. Without any reason why have you come to give so many items of food to such a mean man like me? Gopal said with tears in his eyes—‘Who is the mean person? We have come here with reverence and love to offer food to the apparent Mahesh, our deity. The good opportunity of service what we availed, here also it is only your company, which is the cause. I am your neighbour.’</p>
<p class="Text">Mahesh said—‘Please, offer this food to any worthy one who deserves, you will enjoy the fruit of virtuous deed.’ With tears in his eyes and with some excitement Gopal said—‘I have brought these objects having called the name of goddess Durga. If you return it I will come to conclude that there is no fruit of the name of ‘Durga’, the name ‘Durga’ is false. </p>
<p class="Text">To hear the name of ‘Durga’ false is unbearable to Mahesh. Now, he could not check himself and shouting loudly ‘Durga’, ‘Durga’ along with his wife and children he sat to eat. Sitting just before him Gopal and his wife began to serve them food with great reverence. Getting the divine offering of mother Durga, Mahesh said—‘It was my great luck that Khepu Maharaj happened to meet me today. If he had not met, we would have to satisfy ourselves with simply some boiled rice. Today, Annpurna, herself, is feeding us the divine offering. Today I have viewed the sight of Annapurna. The mother Annapurna wanted to feed us milk and rice with her own hands, so, she diverted my mind to give away the whole rice to Khepu.’</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(3)</p>
<p class="Text">Mahesh pulled on his life by begging and he served his guests also only with that earning. The people took disadvantage of his uprightness. They caused him to work the whole day and paid him scanty of wages. Mahesh didn’t make any objection. If anyone called Mahesh anytime for work, Mahesh at once went there and did his work considering it the service of mother Durga.’ His tongue never missed the name of ‘Durga’. The mother ‘Durga’ also always looked after him and he used to get the adequate money to pull on his livelihood.</p>
<p class="Text">It was the last day of ‘Vaishakh’ (April-May). In the evening hour a Brahman Goswami visited the small  hut of Mahesh as a guest. The appearance of the Brahman was handsome like the unmelted gold. The effulgence was spreading from his body. At that time Mahesh was not present at his hut. Mahesh’s wife conveyed this message to his neighbour Gopal Bhaumik’s house. A number of the village men reached there and they requested the guest Brahman to stay at Gopal’s house or at any other’s house and they said—‘Mahesh is very poor. There is no room in his hut. Here, you will have to sleep in the earthen courtyard; it will cause you trouble, so, Please, accompany us’.</p>
<p class="Text">The Brahman god said—‘I have come here only—Whatever the master of this house gives me, I will accept that but I will go nowhere at anyother’s house.’</p>
<p class="Text">To see the Brahman not agreeing at any cost, the people began to say otherwise in many ways. Someone said—‘He is not a Brahman.’ Someone said—‘He would be the Brahman of the pariahs.’ Someone remarked—‘Sparing the houses of Brahmans and Kayasthas he has stayed at the pariah’s house, this very thing indicates his mentality.’ Cursing in this way all went away.</p>
<p class="Text">In the meantime Mahesh happened to reach, he welcomed the guest with due respect and devotion; he made obeisance. Mahesh had nothing at all in his hut. He went to his neighbourers for the service of his guest. The neighbourers were already irritated. None of them gave him anything and said—‘Bring him here, then, I will give you.’ The poor Mahesh being helpless getting no other way went to the neighbouring village named Madhukhali. There was a big shopkeeper there named Chandranath Shah who was the devotee of Mahesh. To hear the guest’s visit from the mouth of Mahesh he sent abundance of food materials having loaded it on the heads of twenty men with Mahesh and he, himself, also accompanied him.</p>
<p class="Text">Mr. Goswamiji began to explain ‘Shrimadbhagawat’. His explaination was very attractive and worth appreciating. It was already erudite, there was flowing the stream of the divine love in his speech. To observe this those who had cursed earlier began to come and fall on his feet and began to beg for pardon. When his sermon was over after the midnight having offered the food to the Lord, Goswami took the food himself and distributed the divine offering to all. The morning set in the same joy. Just it is found that there is no trace of Goswamiji anywhere. The people made their best effort to search him out but he could not be traced out anywhere. Then, it was confirmed that being graceful to Mahesh the Lord, Himself, had visited disguised in the form of Goswami.</p>
<p class="Text">It was the day of ‘Maghi Purnima’ (the full moonlit night of the month January). The congregational singing was going on in the house of Gopal. In the meanwhile Mahesh reached there and shedding the tears of joy dancing there he began to chant the Lord’s Name very loudly. His whole body was horripilating. Chandranath Saha began to shout ‘blessed, blessed!’ Three prostitutes came and applied the dust of Mahesh’s feet on their heads.</p>
<p class="Text">Mahesh began to say—‘Just see, Nitai and Nimayi’, the both brothers are standing in the courtyard of the congregational singing. Here, they are Radha-Krishna. Shiv-Durga are standing here! Well, it is today the most  auspicious day to die.’ Mahesh said to his wife—‘Bring the mattock and dig the pit and spray water in it.’ The woman did accordingly. Lying down in the pit Mahesh said—‘Make me listen the name ‘Jai Durga’. Noise was created all around. The people gathered there. They saw that there were tears in the eyes of Mahesh, his body was thrilling, The voice of the name of ‘Durga’ was coming out of his mouth and he was smiling mildly. Surrounding him all began to enchant congregational singing. Thus, while listening to the name Mahesh’s soul departed from this worldly body. Even in the Kali age the unobtainable desired death occured.</p>

<p class="Text">That Supreme Lord whose glory is sung by all the four Vedas, who doesn’t come in the meditation of the Yogis, is under the spell of the milkmaids. The loving milkmaids tie Him in the bond of their love. He comes entreating to these milkmaids and the matured wise men say that He doesn’t meet. What a great virtuous deed of these cowmaids was! The bliss what the milkmaids attained is unobtainable even to the Brahma etc. Who can count the auspicious deeds of these innocent milkmaids who made the Lord play-made Him play with inner delight and the outer delight both. The Lord blessed them with the inner joy. They who dedicated and sacrificed their entire for Shri Krishna who forgot their husbands, sons, home everything for Him; for whom the wealth, dignity, honour and kin all became like poison, fulfilled to get Him in the secluded place. Hari was there in their innerself, Hari was there outside, it was Hari who had enclosed them inside Himself.</p>
<p class="Text">There is a holy place of pilgrimage named Panchabati near Nasik. It was here where Mangal was born in an Ahir family in a very common village about two hundred years ago from today. The mother and father of Mangal were farmers of a very common status. There were two bullocks and four to five cows in his house. The father did the work of farming, the mother looked after the cows, churned the curd after curdling milk, took out cream and prepared  ghee and then sold it in the village and in the area. Mangal was the only fondling son of the Ahir-couple. Who was there anyone who remained deprived of fascination to see Mangal’s black curled baby hair, his broad eyes, his charming face and his fascinating look? Whosoever saw him got bewitched. Whosoever passed by that side did not move ahead without looking him to the content of his heart. Mangal became the the source of amusement for the women of the whole village. They visited Mangal’s house on any pretext—someone came on the pretext of litting lamp, some on the pretext of demanding rennet for churning milk and someone on the pretext of reminding any forgotten matter. To see Mangal none’s heart was contented, all of them wanted Mangal to remain continuing the pupil of their eye.</p>
<p class="Text">Thousands of years ago we have caused Kanhaiya to play in our lap, That pleasure is rooted in our hearts and with the sacraments of birth after birth wherever we go, wherever we live at the very place there our soul wriths, our heart pines there are different kinds of emotions in our heart. This is the reason if any handsome child happens to be visible ‘the memory of our handsome dearest becomes fresh and our mind happens to go away in any other world, in the other memories of the past; it may be even for a moment. The same past memories came to swell in the milkmaids of the village—the same Nandrani, the same Nandlal came before the eyes. </p>
<p class="Text">The mother is churning the curd; Mangal has mounted on her back and holding her neck with his small arms he has clinged to her neck. This delight can be experienced by any mother-hearted only. Mangal was already naughty and notorious. Escaping from the mother’s eyes he used to eat the upper portion of the curd or to distribute the collected cream among his friends was very favourite to him. The mother took his all such mischiefs with great fondling and endearment and she didn’t say a single word to him so that it might not hurt the heart of her fondling child the least.</p>
<p class="Text">It was the ‘Janmashtami’ night. There was a great festive at Mangal’s house. The men and women of that village and surrounding area had gathered there. The swing adorned with a seat was set. On it the charming idol of Shyamsunder was placed. The mother was pulling the silken rope slowly and slowly and was singing—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मेरी अँखियनके भूषन गिरिधारी। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बलि बलि जाउँ छबीली छबि पर </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अति आनंद सुखकारी॥</p>
<p class="SHLOK">परम उदार चतुर चिंतामणि </p>
<p class="SHLOK">दरस परस दुखहारी। </p>

<p class="SHLOK">कहा बरनौं गुनगाथ नाथ के </p>
<p class="SHLOK">श्रीबिट्ठल हृदय बिहारी॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘O the jewel of my eyes, Girdhari! Your beautiful appearance is so charming and delightful that I sacrifice myself for the sake of Your love again and again. O Chintamani; You are so clever and merciful that Your sight and touch removes away all the sorrows. Your glory is boundless and You think the offering of a few basil leaves as Your great service. The women of Gokul sing in Your praise that You protected them uplifting the big mountain. There are no words to praise, the virtues of the Lord Bitthal abiding in the heart.’</p>
<p class="Text">The mother is singing, Mangal is gazing that charming without wink, He is unable to understand what is all this going on. But in his mind and soul a divine thrill is dancing. He is seeing all this with an inquisitive and delightful view and dancing. It came to be midnight. The most fondling of Deoki incarnated in the heart of each and every being. There is joy spreading all around. Mangal’s joy has no bound. He asks his mother again and again—‘Mother! What are all these and for what purpose?’ The mother comes to kiss her child with tears of joy in her eyes and says in the choking voice—‘Lalla! Today the most charming of all the three worlds Shri Gopal Krishna has visited our house,’ ‘How is He mother?’ ‘What should I say how He is? He is extremely handsome, most pleasing the dearest One! If you happen to see Him once you cannot leave Him, you will remain accompanying Him day and night, you will forget to eat and drink and you will forget me even.’ This night of today proved to be great mysterious for Mangal. He remained absorbed in thought throughout the night—‘How is He who if sighted once, can never be left, How is He whom to attain once everything is forgotten?’ </p>
<p class="Text">The next day, when Mangal went out with his cows to graze them, the words uttered in the night were assailing about in his mind. Again and again the same thought was haunting his mind—who is that companion to get whom the hunger and thirst of the life is pacified forever? Mangal’s heart, today was craving to meet his dearest friend. He left the cows to graze. He remained playing with the calves for sometime. Dark, jet black, white, round all cows went away, the calves also went far away after them. When Mangal saw the accumulation of rain clouds today, his heart happened to exhilarate, when he saw the fields full of greenery spread long, his heart upsurged with emotions. When He saw the row of cranes flying in the sky and wanted—‘I too, should fly with them’. He saw the overflowing and strutting rivers and wanted ‘I too, could join their currents and would go ‘somewhere’. Every particle of the world was giving him an unique indication today—a particular indication was there, which he was unable to understand even to understand it and even not understanding it he was understanding.</p>
<p class="Text">It does not require the perfect sensibility and the knowledge of scriptures to follow the path leading to the Lord, neither there is needed the critical analysis of the serious secrets of knowledge and realization; and its research nor there is need of the analysis of the essential truths. There is the need of only the whole-hearted dedication. Such a condition occurs one day in the life of every human being, when he listens to the indication of the Lord clearly. This indication is for the sake of every creature—the living being as a whole. But most of the beings turn a deaf ear even to hear this inner voice and remain engrossed in the luxurious and sensuousness of the world. There are only a few so lucky who having sacrificed their lives dedicate themselves, this world and thereafter world to the Lord’s feet. Such one’s life becomes overwhelmed with Lord Hari. Their all actions what they perform are offered to Shri Krishna. They eat-drink, they sleep and rise, they sit and stand, they laugh and play whatever they do, it is for the love of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">And the Lord’s mystery, His love, His frolicsome activities are realized in the past by making effort to know them. It is the Lord, Himself who makes His devotees realize all this and more than this the other secret mysteries and the true realization is basically only then, when the Lord, Himself, having incarnated in the land of our heart makes us realize—when He echoes each and every matter of His own. All our doubts are cleared, all our questions are solved, all the riddles are unveiled only in His single sweet smile, single mild laughter. The motion of life flows towards the feet of Shri Krishna with the spontaneous flow like the flow of Ganga; the entire world sinks in the great ocean of joy. There remains no existence of any other object except the love of Shri Krishna. Having blessed the devotee with the delight of His embrace, the Lord cools his each and ever\y part of the body. He willy nilly lifts up him in His lap and wipes off his tears with His yellow garment. Casting His look of love He consoles him. Such is His frolicsome activity. A number of devotees lives as its witness. Even today such experience is not difficult.</p>
<p class="Text">What a strange is His love! If we cast our look towards Him once, He runs towards us lacs of times and becomes the customer of our love. If any one fells into His grip only once, He surrenders himself to Him forever; He adopts him forever whom He touches only once. That great lover, the God is wandering about here and there for the sake of love. He is begging the alms of love from each and everyone from door to door. We snub Him; even then that stern  lover comes again and again to us having no consideration of our disregard and reproach and says—‘O the being! Purchase me forever for a drop of love. I will accept your slavery. </p>
<p class="Text">But what an unfortunate man is! Our sight never goes towards the  love begging of this peculiar guest at all. We are afraid of being under spell if our eye sight was attracted towards there only once. Mangal’s innersight turned towards Him, it may be only once and He became Mangal’s close friend forever. Throughout the day only His apperance, in the night only His dream, it seemed so as if someone were saying placing the hands on his back—‘Look towards Me, talk to Me, utter something!’ Mangal, having the experience of this touch, fainted in a divine bliss. When he slept in the night he felt that someone was sitting on his bedrest, placing my head in His lap He is showering the sparkling of His mild smile on me-sometimes, He laughs and sometimes sings slowly and slowly. Sometimes entangling His tender fingers into the hair of my head He fondles me, sometimes kisses my eyes and tickles my cheeks. Mangal fails to understand whose dramatic plays are these. But he knew it that He has a friend who accompanies me day and night.</p>
<p class="Text">Mangal began to observe the sportive display of the Lord of frolicsome activities. In the night he took the half sleep and the rest half he remained awakened. It seemed so as if someone very dearest to him were titillating his consciousness, In the morning when he got up, the experience of that horripilation remained continuing. Having untied the cows when he took them away to the forest to graze them, he felt as if his companion was accompanying him. Sometimes He is singing, sometimes He is dancing, sometimes He gets displeased in love, sometimes clinging to the neck He expressed the feelings of His mind and sometime He becomes visible and sometimes invisible. Having placed the flute on His red lips, red like ripaned fruit.  It is not known what He is singing in different tunes and to hear His song the animates and inanimates of all the three worlds are charmed. Playing on His flute moving with the gait of the catastrophe like a passionate elephant when He throws out His playful sight, the whole earth sinks into the sweet honey.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, Mangal felt a supernatural joy while grazing the cows. He got the sight of different plays of the Lord in the forest. Now, his close affinity developed with the cows and calves. He saw in the forest that Shri Krishna was kissing any calf lifting up in His lap and sometimes he saw Him playing His flute mildly having placed it on His lower lip taking the support of the cow-back with His left hand. Raising their ears the cows are gazing at Him without wink of eye and being charmed they are listening to the tune of the flute. When the flute is played on the band of bullocks and cows and the deers of the forest become unmoved as delineated having lost the sense of their existence without having chewed the mouthful keeping it in the same position as it is in the mouth, having raised their ears, closed their eyes as if in sleep. With the divine scent of the garlands of flowers the entire earth is covered, the inanimates have become animate, the animates as inanimates. Mangal saw all these exploits apparently and saw it overwhelmed with charm!</p>
<p class="Text">It is the occurence of a day. It was getting sun-set. The sun was moving Westward. Watching the evening time Mangal was returning home with his cows. Then what he sees that his beloved friend is also coming back with him. His eyes were getting overwhelmed with the intoxication in emotion. The dust created by the hoofs of the cows has clotted on His face and hairs, so His face is looking pale like the ripe jujube tree fruit, there is the garland of tender sprouts in His neck, walking swinging to and fro like the lord elephant, a wonderful lustre is spreading on His tender cheeks by the brilliance of His golden ear rings. Today, Mangal failed to control himself. He wanted that he should engulf this strange appearance. So, he moved forward and tried to take that charming Mohan of all the three worlds in the bond of his embrace. But .............!!</p>
<p class="Text">What varities of the sportive displays of that divine player are! If you don’t pay heed to Him, He knocks at the door again and again, disturbs the whole day and night, neither He let us sleep nor let us eat. But when one moves towards Him with the cry of heart’s distress, that tricky hides it is not known where and hides in such a way as He becomes out of trace; becomes missing. To meet and after meeting separation and by separating again and again to show His glimpse for a moment and again to hide Himself, this hide and seek is His peculiarity. He will appear in a moment and again He will be hidden in the next moment. He will meet open-heartedly and in a moment only He will escape away. Neither it becomes possible to hold Him nor is it possible to give Him up. Since the births after births we have been gazing His appearance but our heart remained yet uncontented.</p>
<p class="Text">Between the meeting and separation the stream of discipline remained going on facing the gusto. The display of meeting had been over, now the scene of separation was about to start. This separation, too, is not less pleasant in anyway than the meeting. Everything of the dearest one is dear. His meeting is also dear and His separation is also dear. What is dearer whether meeting or separation, who should tell it. As the rainy season sets in it rains, there is lightening in the sky, there is roar of the clouds, there is the gust of wind, the flowers bloom and the birds start chirping in the excess of joy, similarly just like the same on getting the sight of the dearest Lord’s appearance, there is the rain of tears from the eyes in the profound joy, there comes the mild smile on the lips, the bud of the heart comes to blossom, the head starts shaking with the gust of delight, it starts the roaring of that dearest friend’s name every moment and the ecstacy of love drenches completely in the praise of the Lord’s virtues. The meeting and separation both are the means of the Lord’s meeting. The experience of this bliss is neither to the man of action nor to the man without action, neither to the savant nor to the mendicant. It is beyond the approach of the Vedas even, this is beyond the reach of Brahma; it is ever effulgent near the man of aesthetic sense. This is the ultimate end of spiritual practice, this is the climax of the frolicsome activity of love. This is the Yogic practice of the Yogis, this is the accomplishment of the devotee’s devotion, this the perfect celiberation of love of the lovers. </p>
<p class="Text">Now, Mangal’s condition began to appear some strange. It is only the experienced one who can know the sorrow of separation after meeting. Now, Mangal was in a position neither he could weep nor could he laugh. There was joy in the memory of meeting and sorrow of separation. Such waves were rising in his heart that it was useless to remain alive without that Dearest Lord. He took no interest in doing any work. Neither he felt hunger nor sleep. He remained weeping day and night, while weeping he came to guffaw sometimes. Strange was his condition of a mad. People were unable to understand what the matter was. The father thought that his son had gone mad so there should be his treatment. The Ayurvedic and Unani doctors were consulted. But the disease was beyond treatment.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">‘मीराकी प्रभु पीर मिटै जब </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बैद साँवलियो होय।’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Mira says that she can be cured only when the Lord, Himself is the physician.’</p>
<p class="Text">Mangal himself set out in search of his physician. Such is the condition of the lovers. The condition of the man whose heart is pierced by the sharp arrow of love, becomes like the condition of a lunatic. Any discussion of the world doesn’t look pleasant to him. In spite of making efforts he cannot speak. His whole body becomes thrilled. The rays of love-flow emerging from his whole body spread over pure luminosity of love. The whole atmosphere is changed into love. In the obsession of love he weeps again and again, sometimes laughs, and sometime starts singing loudly and dancing shamelessly. Mangal’s mother was following to some extent this divine insanity of Mangal. She had marked the gradual change in Mangal’s behaviour since the night of Janmashthami. She was fully contented with this Mangal’s condition. She knew it well that she is the mother of a son in true sense whose son is devoted to the Lord Hari’s feet. She appreciates her luck and bowing down her head to the Lord’s feet she always prays to the Lord only—‘O Lord! don’t leave this child now, in this way having kindled the fire of love in his heart; now, make him His own completely; I submit him to your feet gladly. Now, do accept him.’</p>
<p class="Text">But the Lord had accepted him already beforehand. He is not a common hunter. It is never possible that His aim should miss. Whosoever he may be, at whom He shot His arrow of love, he was robbed of. The painful condition of the wounded is known to the wounded one only or it is known to that hunter who assaults hiding himself in different places; sometimes he causes the minor hurt and sometimes he causes fatal wound. As the deer in whose body the arrow is pierced writhes, the devotees of the Lord also run through the same condition. He pierces His arrow into the heart directly and leaves the arrow as it is. The Sadhak goes to the  lane of love to amuse himself, to look squarely in the eyes but on reaching there he loses instead of gaining. He attains the condition of sucking the heated sugarcane, neither he can suck nor can he leave sucking. Having been wounded he remains roaming about here and there. He suffers through a peculiar type of pain; neither medicine nor prayer nothing works there.</p>
<p class="Text">There is a small temple on the bank of Godawari in the forest. There is the couple idols of Shri Radha-Krishna. There is the dense forest of basil plants-stretched far and wide. The wild trees and creepers are adding to the charm of the place more. The peacocks and wild animals have made the wood explicit. The floating flowers of the forest on the tranquiled and stilled waves of Godawari appear as if the Goddess of the forest has offered the handful of flowers to the lord Suryanarayan (Sun). The soft and tender rays of the rising sun are playing dalliantly in the entire forest zone and on the heart-land of Godawari. Sitting on the bank of Godawari in the forest of basil leaves, Mangal is calling the Lord of his heart with a look of helplessness with choking throat. While making prayer constantly he is fainted and falls down there. In the state of faint Mangal got a spell (Mantra) of six letters <span class="char-style-override-3">‘ॐ राधायै स्वाहा’</span> (Om Radhayai Swaha) from a saint of divine physique. The ‘Mantra’ reached his heart entering through his ears and in the land of his heart, by the consciousness of the Mantra it began to undulate like the electric current. It seemed to Mangal that in the divine letters of cool electric this ‘Mantra’ emanated in his heart in the same way as the moon of the full moonlit night in the pacific blue sky. When Mangal came to his consciousness that pious great saint was not there but that ‘Mantra’ was still bellowing in his heart like an electric wave as it is as the then in the consciousness. Mangal was charmed to see this divine frolicsome activity of this Mantra. From his whole body the tender rays of the ‘Mantra’s’ secret were blooming and he was sinking in the ocean of bliss internally and outwardly both. While openning his eyes he saw the charming image of Radha-Krishna and while closing the eyes he saw the pleasant sportive display of the same couple idols in his heart. It remained continuing the same sweet frolic of the ‘Mantra’ in the natural way in his consciousness, breaths spontaneously without any effort. For a number of years he remained sunk in the same trance of love. He was oblivious of his body and home. Whatever the inhabitants of the interior portion of the forest brought and fed him he used to eat it and whatever they made him drink he drank it.</p>
<p class="Text">It is the midnight of ‘Sharadi Purnima’ (the full moonlit night of the winter). Today Mangal is over enthusiastic. He wreathed the garland of wild flowers; made the garland of the ‘Tulasi-cluster’ (cluster of the basil plant). He made Krishna and Radha wear it with love. He washed their feet with his tears and began to gaze them with unwinking eye. In the course of his look his sight was fixed, his eye-lids came to be stable; then what he sees that the heart of Shri Radharani opens, just like the lotus blossoms by the touch of sun-rays, Having lifted up Mangal Radharani hides him in her heart and the Lord standing there showers His mild smiles. Mangal is not in the existence there, he has dedicated his entire to the feet of his life-breath, the Lord, the ever friend of his life and his gift has been accepted perfectly. A raised platform is errected there near the temple where Mangal used to sit in the basil forest. The people call it the platform of Mangaldas.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Thakur Megh Singh</p>
<p class="Text">Thakur Megh Singh was the holder of an estate. His estate was not so big but it was not very small either. He had a good income. Thakur Saheb was not very learned from letters point of view, but he was learned with practical point of view. That is the knowledge that leads the man to the right path. The knowledge leading the man to the evil course compels to burn in the fierce fire of hell, due to which this life is ruined by falling into the dreadful storm of arrogance, lust, anger, greed, infatuation etc; that is the apparent ignorance, false knowledge. It is a must to escape from such unowledge. Thakur Megh Singh was safe from such knowledge. His knowledge had illuminated his life from all sides so his all actions were perfromed keeping in view the supreme goal of the human life.</p>
<p class="Text">All were pleased with his sustenance of the subjects and justice. His each and every decision used to be full of compassion with the view of the general interest of the public and affectionate to the subjects. He had not to face any difficulty even in the greatest sacrifice. Due to his firm faith in the dispensation of the Lord he was neither agitated nor he felt dismay and agitation, doubtelessly it proves faith in the Lord. Thakur Saheb remained always cheerful and happy. To remember the Lord had become the life-breath of his life. Daily regularly he got up early in the morning one hour before the sun-rise and just getting up he meditated upon the Lord. Then after answering the call of nature and taking bath he performed ‘Sandhya’, muttered the Japa of ‘Gayatri’, hymned ‘Gita’ and ‘Vishnusahstranama’ and he got himself engaged then in chanting the Lord’s name.</p>
<p class="Text">At the time of muttering also his mental concentration continued already. At the mid of the day his worship was over. Then, having got the visitors and guests served food, he took the meal himself in the form of offerings of the Lord. There after he went to the court to manage his estate affairs and very wisely, tactfully and patiently he controlled all the royal affairs and settled the disputed matters. Even in that period his mind remained remembering constantly the Lord. He did all the works remembering the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">All kinds of human beings are present there in this world. The pious life routine and saintly nature of Thakur Saheb became the cause of someone’s jealousy and hostility. Due to the crookedness of heart overpowered by ignorance the view point changes. Then, he begins to see bad in good, devil in God, immoral in moral and false in truth. On the damage of wisdom the damage of action is but natural. A servant of Thakur Saheb became the victim of the same opposite nature. He was ‘Charan’ by caste and Bhairundan was his name. He was the most reliable man of Thakur Saheb and there was no fault in his behaviour in the past also; but by any divine evil consequence his mind went astray and turning to be hostile in his mind he began to think of killing Thakur Saheb. One day, it got late in the court for Thakur Saheb. It was the first watch of night. It was the dark fortnight. It had spread darkness all around outside. At that time Thakur Saheb came out and moved towards his residence a bit afar Bhairundan was accompanying him. His evil mind dominated, Bhairundan unseathed his dagger, his hands trembled first; but by the drive of sin being again attentive he made an attack on his master of saintly nature in the darkness. But God’s will was otherwise, at the same moment a bull happened to come running from the front. Thakur did move onward and one of the horns of the  bull struck the chest of Bhairundan. He fell down on the ground with the dagger; his hand had turned back so the dagger knocked at his nose. The front portion of the nose was cut off. Bhairundan cried. It took a moment in this occurence. Thakur Saheb was just close to him. Having heard his cry he turned back. The bull had moved forward. He lifted up Bhairundan lying on the ground. He had become unconscious by the wound of the horn and the pain of his nose. Thakur Saheb got the servants called upon from the female apartment. Having lifted up Bhairundan they took him away to the female apartment. Outside in the assembly house he was laid down on a cot. The lamp had been brought till then. He saw the blood-shed dagger in his clutch and his nose was bleeding. His fist was so tight that the dagger did not fall out. Thakur got astonished to see this sight. This was the presumption in his mind that he had been knocked down by the bull but he was unaware of the mystery of the cutting off his nose and the dagger in his clutch. Although he had marked Bhairundan assaulting him in the darkness but instead of involving himself in the worry to know this secret he began to make effort to make him conscious. He took out the dagger having opened his fist. He washed his nose; pasted lime on it. He applied some ointment on his chest and having poured down water on his head, he began to fan himself. There was no other one there except the family servants so, the thakur’s wife, too, had reached there. She also began to fan. By this service and treatment Bhairundan came to his consciousness internally very soon; but due to the excess pain of the chest his eyes did not open; he remained lying as it was. On the otherside the wife of Thakur initiated a topic and in this it had happened as follows—</p>
<p class="Text">Thakurain (the wife of Thakur)—Charanji’s chest was hurt with the horn of the bull, this is the matter of mishappening; but why had he already taken the dagger in his hand? Was it not so that he wanted to assault you? </p>
<p class="Text">Thakur Saheb had seen Bhairundan attacking on him; but his saintly mind did not make any doubt. He thought that he would have taken the dagger in his hand to protect him. There was nothing in his mind as such till now; but his wife’s question awakened his mind to an extent; but why would the doubt he created in the pious mind free from doubt? He said-</p>
<p class="Text">‘Isn’t it that you have gone mad? Bhairundan is my most reliable companion. ‘Will he use his dagger on my neck?’, To have such doubt in mind even is a sin. Probably he might have taken the dagger in his hand for my protection.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thakurain (his wife)—What was there need to protect you? It appeals to my sinful mind only that there was evil intention in Charan’s mind, but it was the God who protected you.</p>
<p class="Text">Thakur—See, in my opinion you should not think so. To create doubt about anyone is sin. And after all you know it very well that whatever we get to pass through in this world, all is done in our Shri Gopalji’s guidance and according to His dispensation. He is great well-wisher so His dispensation is also auspicious. If that dagger had worked that would have also happened according to His auspicious dispensation. It was ineffective, it was also His auspicious rule. As I understand, the wound what Bhairundan suffered, there is also hidden his good, why would he try to kill me? If he did so, certainly there would have been some action of the previous birth responsible for this inspiration that would have stimulated him to do so. If suppose, it is also not so and in reality any ill will has come to his mind then, according to the auspicious rule of the auspicious  Lord, he has atoned it by this injury. Whatever the fierce hell he would have to suffer in future, that he has suffered with this minor injury. As regards myself, I am fully confident that the Lord does always good to all. I pray to my Lord pitiably—‘O the Lord of mercy! Bhairundan is the most reliable to me. If my mind is clear from the ill-will of anyone or to do any ill of any other or of him, he may be free from pain or if any ill-will has come to his mind that should also be rooted out. If this occurence is the fruit of his any sin, O Lord! That should be caused to me to suffer and his mental and physical tribulation and its cause should also be destroyed.’</p>
<p class="Text">While making prayer in this way, the stream of tears began to flow from the eyes of Thakur Saheb. To see his condition and being impressed by his pious sentiments his wife’s heart also melted. Weeping she also made prayer to the Lord—‘Lord! The doubt about Charanji what was created in my mind forgive me for this sin and free Charanji from pain at once.’</p>
<p class="Text">Bhairundan was conscious internally already. He  heard all the words of conversation—As he was listening to it so was his mind changing and he was repenting for his doing. His heart was purified with the fire of repentance. Then, when Thakur Saheb made prayer to the Lord his heart became completely pious and in a moment the pain of his chest disappeared. He opened his eyes and rising up he lay down in the feet of Thakur Saheb. In this course of time Thakur Saheb had sunk into the nectar-ocean of the joy of the Lord’s meditation. He was oblivious of outside. His wife was also unconscious in emotion. Charan remanied lying in the feet of the both for sometime. When Thakur and his wife became outwardly conscious by the Lord’s motivation they found Bhairundan washing their feet with his tears lying in their feet. Thakur lifted him up and embraced him to his heart.</p>
<p class="Text">Bhairundan getting himself released said weeping—‘Lord! it is only I, the vilest sinner who can be compared to a great sinner like me. My master! don’t touch a sinner like me. I, the worm of hell, the most wicked had moved to kill you to see evil in you. The Lord was very graceful to me that the God, disguised in the form of a bull came and saved you from my foul attack. Not only He saved you but He gave me a good lesson by cutting off my nose and saved me and saved in such a way that He rooted out the tree of my sin. This is all the miracle of your saintly nature and your love to the God. I am burning in the fire of repentance. I want its proper punishment. Only then, I will be contented.’</p>
<p class="Text">Smiling Thakur Saheb said—‘Bhairundan! Don’t worry the least, You are now more dearer to me than even before as you were my most favourite. Your this conduct has developed my faith in the Lord more. So, I feel much obliged and indebted to you. Whatever the instrument may be if it develops the faith in the Lord and increases, that instrument may not be beautiful in appearance even but that is the most appreciating superior and adorable. You proved instrument to this purpose. So, you are my best well-wisher friend. You want punishment, it is good. I give you punishment, not to your body only but I punish your body, mind and speech all the three. If you want it you will accept it gladly also. Yes, if you accept it you will make me more indebted. The punishment what I give you is—you should always serve all the beings with the sentiment of considering them the form of God not causing any harm to anybody by your body, by your speech. You should never speak any harsh word to anybody and you should be pleasure-giving to all by your truthful, beneficial, modest and moderate speech and be the source of pleasure to all by the chanting of divine congregational singing of the Lord’s name and attributes and having thrown out the hostility, hypocrisy, lust, anger, greed, dismay and the poison of the worldly thoughts remain absorbed in doing good to all always by the nectar stream of love, simplicity, truthfulness, cheerfulness, contentment and regular Lord’s contemplation and go on doing all these for the sake of the Lord’s pleasure only. This is the staff which is the insignia of a recluse. He who adopts them, is the real recluse. Having assumed these three staff, the insignia of a recluse become a Sanyasi forever. I will be highly grateful to you.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Thakur Saheb’s contemplation of the Lord remained unbroken during the happening of all these. Bhairundan’s life entirely changed and by the company and behaviour of Thakur Meghsinghji and having attained the highest saintliness he became the thiest forever. </p>
<p class="Text">Thakur Meghsingh had the only Prince—Sajjan Singh. He was sixteen years old. He was the store of amiability, beauty and virtues. Only three moths had passed of his wedding. It was the Lord’s dispensation that he fell down from the horse-back one day and it was a serious injury in his head. He became unconscious for a while but after a little time he came to his consciousness. The best possible treatment was given but his condition did not improve. Thus, by and by his wound increased and its poison spread in his whole body. Now, all were sure that Sajjan Singh’s life would not be saved. It could not remain hidden to Sajjan Singh also. His face was faded to some extent. Thakur Megh Singh was reciting ‘Vishnusahashtranam’, sitting inside. To see his faded face he said laughing—‘Son! Why is your face faded? Now yet, you are my son, you are the lord of my estate, you are entitled as my Prince. This all has been done only by the auspicious rule of your Gopalji. Now, you are going to be His apparent son by His auspicious rule only. Now, you will attain the position of Prince and you will be rightful of the Divine estate. My son! This is the time of pleasure. Depart happily, convey my salutation to the auspicious Lord. Convey to Him this also—‘Is there any consideration under pending for the transfer of Megh Singh in Your abode? I am not in hurry, because I have to continue in service always; wherever He deputes me but it must be as such that I am in Your service, this should always remain in my mind.’ </p>
<p class="Text">‘Son! The entire meeting and separation of this world happens on the indication of that frolicsome Lord’s sportive display and happen for our good. He who is acquainted with this fact feels grieved neither in the sorrow nor in the separation from comforts and joy. He always feels ever contented, continuous peace, continuous delight in all the circumstances in all the meetings and separations, in all the joys and sorrows. It was the auspicious signal of the Lord that you were born here and only by auspicious signal of the Lord you are departing from this world to get the blessed dust of that auspicious Lord’s feet. Don’t have any doubt about it. He who remains in a fix goes to the downfall. He who has faith, devotion and love, goes away to the Lord’s abode smiling. Keep on holding the love and devotion firmly, don’t allow the faith to deviate the least. Having departed from here and reaching there you will attain that boundless eternal bliss before which all the objects of comforts here in this world will seem to be trivial. As there is the question of your wife, the princess queen, don’t have any worry for her. She is a chaste lady. Having passed her life saintly here, she too, will attain the position of the maid servant of Shri Gopalji’s feet in His divine abode along with you. Son! it is only the sensuous thoughts that are the cause of downfall, and again in the lustful life of wife-husband there is only the life of sexuality. The love is created in the direct gate-way of the hell. So, that is the certain cause of downfall. The Lord is graceful enough to free the princess queen from the service and attachment of hell gates. She is completely God-devotee and of saintly nature, that is why this grace has fallen on her. She will pass the ascetic life and at the ripe time she will join you in the divine abode. Your mother has already firm faith in the Lord’s auspicious rule. She always finds good only everywhere. Son! Go on your journey comfortably. Depart smiling yourself and making others smile. When all are confident that you will be countless times in better comfortable position there than here,  in spite of the remorse of your separation due to true love all of them will get the highest pleasure. But they will be confident only then when you depart smiling with firm faith.’</p>
<p class="Text">These true words of Thakur left a very emphatic impact on Sajjan Singh. His whole face got illuminated with the soft stainless brilliance of the divine delight. The mild smile spread on his lips; his mental concentration was fixed to the charming idol of the Lord Gopalji and his mouth began to pronounce the Lord’s name. Just at once the the truth orifice of the head having burst his soul departed and reached the Supreme abode of Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Thakur, Thakurain (his wife) and the princess queen, all were present there. But all were happy as if they were bidding farewell to their any most intimate dear one on the auspicious journey for the place of bliss wholeheartedly delightfully with the exhilarated heart.</p>
<p class="Text">Thakur, Thakurain (his wife) and the princess queen—all the three completed their span of life with greater detachment. They coloured their lives in the Lord’s colour especially and at last, at the appropriate time being detached from this transient mortal world they set out for the Lord’s Supreme abode forever.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Thakur Kishan Singh</p>
<p class="Text">Garabdesar was a reverent spot in Bikaner estate. The devotee Kishan Singhji was the Thakur of that very place. About sixtyfive years back he expired. Thakur Saheb was the dedicated devotee of Shri Muralidharji. It is popular among the people that everyday after his prayer and worship the gold weighing one and quarter of Masha used to be got to him from the Lord and he used to donate that gold to the Brahmans in charity daily. There is the mark of gold on the lower lip of the up to date idol. One day, the lady Thakur (Thakurain) kept the gold with her being obstinate, thereafter, the gold was not got from the idol. There are several such sayings among the people to be heard regarding him. Some of them are being stated before the readers. It is possible that the modern scientists may not rely on it, but those who are God-devotee cannot  remain deprived of the exuberance of devotion and love by its word to word to be created in their heart; because as much the devotees know and understand the Lord’s glory so much is not understood by others. Thus— </p>
<p class="Text">Thakur Saheb gave much more value to the Lord’s oath; even to this extent when the men of wicked nature had tried to deceive him by making him to take the Lord’s oath.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, some thieves had persuaded him to take the Lord’s oath that—‘Thakur Saheb! We are taking away the camels, if you disclose it to anyone it is the Lord’s oath to you. Thakur Saheb didn’t disclose it to anyone, but having made the camels run the whole night, the thieves came back again near to the same village in the morning. In the morning the thieves asked—‘What is the name of this village?’ To hear ‘Garabdesar’ from them they were greatly astonished and due to the fear of being caught, they ran away leaving the camels there. </p>
<p class="Text">It was one year when it had rained all around Garabdesar everywhere, but there was not even a drop of rain there. Then the Thakur Saheb said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सो कोसाँ बिजली खिंवें, यामें कूण सँदेह।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">किसनाकी तृसना मिटै, जो आँगन बरसे मेह॥</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord at once, paid attention to his prayer. At the very time the clouds of rain covered the sky and it rained heavily.</p>
<p class="Text">Despite being the holder of the estate; Thakur Saheb kept in sheath the wooden sword only always. Once, a sneaking fellow said to the king of Bikaner—‘What will the Thakur of Garab be of any use at the time as he always keeps the wooden sword with him?’ At this on the occasion of Dusehara festival, when all the estate-holders were present, the Maharaja Saheb (the king) ordered every estate-holder to show his sword to raise it up raising any issue. All of them unsheathed their swords, but Thakur Saheb got so much frightened that his whole body began to tremble and he began to pray to the Lord to himself,—‘O Lord! today, Kishan’s prestige is in Your hand; and with fear in mind he unsheathed his sword; but the moment when his sword was unsheathed, the eyes of all, present there in the royal assembly dazzled with the brilliance of the sword. Then the Maharaja (king) cursed and humiliated that backbiter badly. To see this, Thakur Saheb uttered only this—‘They had given the correct information but the God has proved them false. They are not at fault at all.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Once, Thakur Saheb was going somewhere with Maharaja Saheb (the great king) on any journey. On the way when it was the time of his worship covering his body with clothes Thakur Saheb began to worship the Lord in his mind on the back of the horse. In the worship he was preparing to offer the curd in food to the Lord, in the meanwhile Maharaja Saheb’s (the king) sight fell upon there. Maharaja Saheb (the king) said calling him twice and thrice, ‘Kishan Singh! are you sleeping? Thakur Saheb was absorbed in his worship. He did not listen to the call of the king. So, being irritated he made his horse reach near his horse and pulling out his cloth he threw it away. Then again when the king cast his sight there, he felt much astonished; because, there was the curd spread on the horse and the saddle all. He asked Thakur Saheb,—‘Kishan Singh! What is this?’ Thakur Saheb remained silent for a while but on the king’s more insistence he told him clearly—‘Maharaj! I was offering curd in the food of the Lord in my mental worship, but on drawing the cloth by you I came to startle. By the sudden shaking the curd of my mind fell down. The same curd seems to be apparent by the frolic of the Lord.’ To hear this, being exhilarated Maharaja Saheb (the great king) said—‘Better you go home and worship the Lord.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Once, after getting late in the payment of the arrear of the government revenue being displeased the great king said very clearly—‘Kishan Singh! This is not right, the government revenue should be deposited timely.’ The words suddenly came out of Thakur Saheb’s mouth—‘Please, wait till Deepawali, I will make the worship of Deepawali only after the deposit of the government revenue.’ Having said in this way Thakur Saheb returned home. But the money could not be managed timely. Just on the day of Deepawali till evening anyhow he managed the money from the different sources. At the exact time of worship, anyone came from the inside of the house to call him, but without making the adoration he mounted on his horse with the money and having covered the journey of sixty miles he reached Bikaner till the morning. To see him in the palace Maharaja Saheb (the king) asked him—‘Kishan Singh! It was yesterday when you were to go, what is the matter?’ Why didn’t you go? Were you physically well in the night, was it so?’ To hear the words of Maharaja Saheb (the king) Thakur Saheb said—‘O the sustainer! I am directly reaching here just from my village to deposit the money. I was not at all present here yesterday; there would have some other one’s words in your mind.’</p>
<p class="Text">To hear his words Maharaja Saheb (the king) said—‘What do you say that you have just come to deposit the money? You had already deposited the money yesterday.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thakur Saheb answered—‘No, my sustainer! I was already present in my village yesterday. What is it that you say?’ At last, the king showed him the money deposited in the cash book as well as his signature. Thakur Saheb’s eyes were filled with the tears of love and only the word what came out of his mouth—‘No, doubt, this signature is exactly like mine.’ Thakur Saheb got thrilled to understand the frolic of his Lord. The king of Bikaner, too, got charmed to see the glory of the devotee and affection of the Lord. Having returned Thakur Saheb got the temple of Muralidharji built which is enhancing his glory till today.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">True Vaishnav Devotee-Gudar Baba</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(1)</p>
<p class="Text">This event is related to the ‘Kumbh’ of Vikram-Samvat 1781. On this holy occasion lakhs of dispassionate householder pilgrims from the different states of India are gathered in the foremost holy place of pilgrimage, Prayag to take the holy bath. Swami Somanathacharya, Shankaracharya of ‘Shringeri-math’ and other ‘Vaishnavacharya’ along with their hundreds of followers have taken up abode on the sandy bank of ‘Triveni’. A number of kings, arristrocats, Seth Sahukar (capitalists and money-lenders), learned men-Brahmans and other religious minded Hindus are residing there in ‘Kumbh’. Some of the congregational singing groups of the expert artists in Music of the jester class have also visited there. By showing the miracle of their arts with their skill in music they are making the devotee pilgrims experience the supernatural joy. All around they are in discussion and they are being appreciated very much.</p>
<p class="Text">It is the ‘Magh-Krishna Trayodasi (the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of January). The congregational singing of the ‘Kam-Kautikis’ (jestrers) is going on. There is the rush of the visitors there. They are charming all with their dance and music. Their especiality is that they sing only the devotional songs related to the Lord. There are included some newly married couples also in their group, they have also sung and danced with them; because within the year after their wedding there is the tradition in South for the bride and bridegrooms of that place married during the year to share that dancing and singing.</p>
<p class="Text">All presented their own skilfulness in art and music. Now, this is the turn of the famous saintly and ascetic Smt. Gunmanjari Devi, the master in music. The reverent female ascetic is famous for her penance and expertness in music. She has already performed the rituals of many ‘Krichh-Chandrayan’. She remains depended on eating some fruits only. It is she whose congregational singing is about to be displayed. On this occasion, ‘Shringeri Mathadhish’ Swami Somnathacharyaji has also been invited with due respect and he is present. Tapaswaniji (the female ascetic) appeared on the stage. Her sweet melodious voice began to undulate in the sky romping and rollicking with the air. With the metrical order the earth began to dance with gliding feet. Stillness spread over all around. Her tune and melody assimilated as if the mind of all. All of a sudden the clouds swelled in the sky. The lightening began to thunder. First, it was the month of January, the winter season, and then secondly, the rain. The cold increased. The concentration and rapt attention was disturbed. All began to look restless and became eager to go away. At this time the chief of the Shringeri Monastery said making attentive to all—‘Don’t be impatient, this raining cloud is not the natural cloud but it is the creation of the melodious musical tone of the female ascetic’s voice, So, it is momentary.</p>
<p class="Text">To hear Swamiji’s announcement the audience became alert; then it happened a wonderful miracle. A pretty and charming lady was seen coming like the lightening coming out of the clouds in the sky and in a moment she joined that musical society on the earth in the twinkling of an eye. She began to dance joining that female ascetic. By her music and dance the minds of all began to wander about in the world of the supernatural joy. They began to stare intently; it became pin drop silence. There was nothing heard except the twinkling of anklets and music in the metrical order of those goddesses, For a while this supernatural delight remained covering the whole atmosphere. Then, the musical song was over and the  nymphs became invisible flying in the depth of sky in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p class="Text">Thereafter, the sermon of Shri Shankaracharya Swami started. He said—‘All of you saw the nymph. Everyone saw her coming down from the sky and enjoyed fully her music and dance. Did you understand the cause? Its main reason is that all of you have become sinless by taking bath in the auspicious ‘Triveni’ on this holy festival. Only then you could get the view of that goddess of the subtle divine world otherwise it was not possible. In this dark period of ‘Kaliyuga’ due to the excess of grossness in the human being by nature they don’t get the view of the divine beings. So, due to especial reason this is an uncommon occurence. We have got the humanity from divinity. Our ancestors came upon earth from the divine world and again went there. The root place of us, the Indians is the heaven only. We have also come from there like our ancestors and our destination is there. For this cause only, the Vedic rituals are ceremonised according to the vedic rules. The divine powers are there in those rituals. Having developed by the ceremony of the rituals, they enter the doer unprecedently and at the last time he is drawn to the world above. This is generally the distinctive superiority of the Indian Aryan race. Beyond this the highest religion of the living being as a whole is the highest goal, the salvation where there is the absence of all the sorrows, there is the freedom from birth and death, there is the freedom from the bond of this world. This is called the divine religion. Its supreme goal is the Lord only. The Vedic functions are the supplement of this especial religion. As the aims of the general morality-rituals-Yagya is divinity; likewise the supreme goal of this righteousness is the spiritual truth. To attain the state of the Lord is the Supreme goal of the living being as a whole. As the heaven is the field of gods, similarly the abode of the Supreme Lord is the unvanquished country of the spiritual truth, There is fear of downfall in the heaven, there is not the perfect immortality; but the supreme divine beyond the three basic qualities of human nature (as Sattva, Raj, Tam) free from place and time the Lord’s abode is the state free from fear. It is stationary immutable and eternal. That is the perfect immortality. But it is rarely available because that is beyond the speech, mind and sight. The Lord’s next word in the form of Brahma is overt in the world. The same Brahma is infusing life to the entire creation by His omnipresent blissful internal locomotive power. That is ‘Ram-Nam’ (Ram’s Name). The Almighty ‘Om’ is also an aspect of the same absolute truth. But this is the right of entitled only and the ‘Ram-Nam’ is the right of all. The living being as a whole has the right of its muttering. As the ‘Om’ being means is the productive of the realization of the absolute truth, Brahma, similarly ‘Ram-Nam’ is the nourishing of the Spiritual truth causing the contentment of the devotion of the Supreme Lord. So, the muttering of ‘Ram-Nam’ should be practised by all. In the ‘Kaliyuga’ it is the highest and the easiest means to cross the ocean of mundane existence and the infallible divine ‘Mantra’ free from do’s and dont’s of the Kalpataru (Divine tree), the seed and fruit both.</p>
<p class="Text">‘On this occasion it seems necessary to point out some religious rules of the bath also. On the day of the bath having got up early in the morning one hour before the sun-rise remembering the Lord’s name and being free from the purification of the daily routine the common bath should be taken. There after the daily routine of ‘Sandhya’ etc. Pronouncing the ‘Ram’s Name’ with the sentiment of innerself the departure for the bath should be made with the members of the individual groups peacefuly. Then, reaching the bank having made obeisance to the ‘Triveni’ and having accepted her holy water reverently on the head, it is proper to enter the water then. Silence should be observed that day. By doing so, there is the intact accomplishment of that righteous deed. If anyone is unable to observe it the whole day and night, it is proper to maintain keeping silence at least in the duration of the bath. Silence creates its conviction and protects the righteous deed; it makes our instinct introvert and in the innerself there is the induction of Sattva. By the contribution of holy water the purity that is created, enters the subtle body cleaning this pulp body and washes away its impurity also. It develops the Sattva and destroys the Tamas. The actions in which the rays of the illumination of Sattva and permeats are called the righteous deeds and the places where these qualities are found are called pilgrimiges and holy places. Their performance and staying at holy places purifies the innerself and the man becomes worthy of attaining the self-enlightenment. It is essential for all of you to know one thing more. After taking bath in this holy water when you go to your own homes, Wash your feet yourself, don’t get it washed by some otherone because it decays the fruit of the virtuous deeds. There having got the fire-sacrifice performed and made the brahmans take food satisfy them whole-heartedly with the donation and honour. Thus, in this way your bath-ritual will be completed.</p>
<p class="Text">In the meanwhile a Sadhu came and stood there and began to say—‘I am very hungry. Is there any virtuous person among you who may feed me to my fill?’ All were amazed to hear his words that—‘Did he not get food to satisfy his appetite in this such a big function!’ All of them came to say—‘Whatever and how much food material you want tell us so that it may be presented before you for your food.’ To hear the Sadhu said—‘What should I eat more, whatever I eat that will go out of the body in the form of faeces and urine. If you are interested to satisfy me with food, I will eat nothing; all of you should please, offer me the ‘Ram-Nam’ (Ram’s Name) pronounced by you at the time of bath on this occasion. The hunger of my stomach will be satisfied fully only by that much. Tell me, will you satisfy the hunger of the Sadhu’s stomach?’ All were taken aback to hear the demand of his begging, none was in a position to speak anything. When the silence spread all around, Swami Somnathacharyaji then said—‘Well Baba! I offer you my ‘Ram-Nam’. To hear his resolve by and by all others also began to say—‘I, too, offer, I, too, offer.’ To hear the resolve of all that Sadhu said—‘Well! now, my appetite is well satisfied. By your this great charity there was not the least loss of your that especial virtuous deed, but it waxed. May ‘Ram-Nam’ do your good!’</p>
<p class="Text">Thereafter all departed for their camps after the chanting of Rama-Rama.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(2)</p>
<p class="Text">It is the full dark night of January (Magha Amawasya) today. It is the big festive of bathing on the bank of Triveni. The pilgrims of all the four classes of births and of all the four stages of life have gathered there. Both the groups of detached Vaishnavas, the austeres and with a staff as his insignia are present with their elegance. All appear to be generous, peaceful, kind-hearted and devoted. There is the lustre and brilliance on the faces of all. Those days, the ancestors of ‘Ramanandiya Viraktas’ (the renounced followers of Ramanand) the renounced pious followers of ‘Shree community’ (Shree Sampradaya) were called auster ‘Vaishnava’ (who maintained the tuft of hair) and (who had no tuft of hair) ‘Sanyasi Dandi’ were called Vaishnava. The both groups are performing a auspicious deed of taking bath with mutual love. There is a great rush on the bank because the rush consists of all the catagorties of pilgrims. Generally, all appear to be noble, civilized and devoted. There is reverence to religion in the hearts of all. None gives push to any other one; all give way to other one with respect. On account of arrogance no one trespasses the path of any other one and tries to go ahead. All try to escape from the path of the women and all have the attitude in their mind and sentiment in their heart to help others. In the midst of such a big crowd no mean creating choas and disturbance is visible. All are taking bath happily remaining alert in the protection of virtuous deed. They are doing charity to the Pandas. They, too, accept whatever anyone offers to them with devotion, blessing them without any opposition. They are very attentive to provide comfort to the pilgrims and their clients.</p>
<p class="Text">In the meanwhile an unique scene is seen in the current of the Triveni. All began to watch towards that side without wink of eye in the inquisitiveness. A beautiful object like a lotus or rose came to be visible in the current of the river. Floating on the current it came to stop at a place on the current and became fixed there. All were astonished to see it as what is this? If it is a plucked flower then why did it stop floating and that too in the current of the water? That should float, why did it stop in the current? All are busy in the different imaginary presumptions in solving this problem of the mystery. It has attracted the attention of everyone, the eyes of all are fixed at it. In the meanwhile, Vijai Pal Rashtrakut, the feudal chieftain of the Vidarbh country got his large boat brought and boating on it he moved towards the current where the object like flower was present. Reaching there he saw some otherwise sight, That symbolic object like flower was a beautiful most charming girl. She was not more than seven or eight years old. Mr. Rashtrakut took her in his lap having lifted her up and turned the boat towards the bank. The public began to see towards the boat eagerly. When the boat reached the bank the rush of the people swelled. Suddenly, all began to gaze at the child. Someone said—‘She has frozen with cold, warm her with fire.’ Someone said—‘She has drunk excess of water, get her revolved on the potter’s wheel.’ She was warmed with fire also, the Potter’s wheel was also brought. When the people got bent upon to cause her to rise on the wheel, that lass prohibited them by indication. Now, to revolve on the wheel was stopped. A Brahman who was worshipping on the bank, took away there the sacred water of the Lord Shalgram’s feet. The girl drank it. Thereafter Vijai Pal Rashtrakut took away her to his camp and offered her to the lap of the queen.</p>
<p class="Text">The Rashtrakut-couple had no issue. So, he was very much pleased considering the gift of the Triveni. They tried their best but she neither ate anything nor drank water and nor did she utter any word. Well, she began to indicate with hand something, but none could understand it. The queen called Rashtrakut and showed him her indication. First, he, too, could understand nothing. But suddenly there came its mystery to some extent in his mind to understand by the Lord’s grace. He came to understand that she was indicating to take her away to any great soul. Well, he took away her to the monastery chief of Shringeri Swami Somanathacharya and related her narrative to him. The girl said to Swamiji in the Sanskrit language—‘Call any virtuous Vaishnava.’ Swamiji said—‘I, myself, am also the Vaishnava.’ Then, that girl said—‘No doubt, you are Vaishnava but you have yet not been perfect Vaishnava.’ Swamiji thought that she meant the especial outward marks like the mark of Sandal paste on the forehead etc., which are generally done by the austere (detached) Vaishnavas. So, he asked his someone witty disciple to bring any superior ascetic Vaishnava from the group, He went with palanquin to the Vaishnava community and conveyed to them Swamiji’s command. To hear this some Vaishnava great souls became eager to go. Then, the messenger Swami said—‘There is only a single palanquin here. Anyone whom you want to get seated, get him seated and the other holy souls can walk on foot.’ It was done so, many Vaishnavas started and came to Swami Somanathacharya, He offered them seat to sit with due respect and acquainted them with the introduction of the girl.</p>
<p class="Text">That unique girl asked for a bowl and Shalgram idol. Swamiji got his own Shalgram and the silver bowl of the councillor available. The girl got the ‘Gangajal’ (Water of the Ganga) filled in the bowl and dropped the Lord Shalgram into it. For the test of the true ‘Vaishnava’ she fixed the test that by whose peeping into the bowl Shalgramji comes up on the level of the water from the bottom he is the true Vaishnava.</p>
<p class="Text">All were requested to look into the bowl. All peeped into but the Shalgramji didn’t leave the bottom. Then, Swamiji, himself, went and looked into the bowl. By his peeping Shalgramji left the bottom and came up in the middle of the bowl water. But He didn’t come up the top level of the water. The chief of the Shringeri Math gave instruction to some of his learned and intelligent disciples that they should investigate among the rest Vaishnavas and getting them distinguished very carefully they should bring the true Vaishnava. </p>
<p class="Text">The ‘Dandi Mahatmas’ approached all the Vaishnava communities; but they failed to find out any Vaishnava or there was none such in their eyes. Yes, in a corner they found a Gudar Baba. On whose upper part of the face there was no mark of Vaishnava. Neither he appeared to be any austere or detached Vaishnava and nor Dandi, he was an unique Mahatma of unsystematic type. A hunchbacked stick, a torn and tattered Gudari and a broken ‘Tummi’—‘all these were the objects what he had with him. The disciples of Swamiji requested him and informed him about their preceptor’s command. Gudar Baba said indifferently—‘Baba! What will you do taking away me with you? Where should I go? Your Swamiji is in search of a Vaishnava, there are so many Vaishnavas available, take them away. Why do you disturb me? I am merely a poor beggar.’ The attendants of Swamiji said—‘Whosoever had visited there none of them could pass the test of the true Vaishnavism, none of them could prove himself to be a true Vaishnava. So, our reverent preceptor has sent us in the search of a hidden real Vaishnavas. So, Please, prove our effort true and take trouble to accompany us.’ Gudar Baba said—‘I don’t know what your Swamiji has said! What is that distinctive quality of a Vaishnava in me? Why are you roaming about uselessly? Go and search out anywhere else. Don’t waste your time here.’ Even then, they requested but Babaji remained resolute and did not budge an inch even. Those Dandi Mahatmas also pursued doggedly as if it is the prey underhand. They said—‘Now, whom should we remain searching out and where? It is you only, Please, be graceful, we will again make you reach here. If you don’t accompany us so easily, we will carry you forcibly devotedly. By anyway we want to take you away there. We are being inspired by our inner consciousness. Now, Please, don’t delay more.’ To see their insistence of love Gudar Baba said—‘Well! then what should I do, You don’t agree, you are bent upon.’ Having uttered so he rose up and accompanied them.</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(3)</p>
<p class="Text">Gudar Baba came there. The chief of Shringeri Math welcomed him with love, he left his seat and stood to receive him. All the members of Vaishnava group got astonished to see him that it is he such a Vaishnava who has been called! Some came to the extent to say—‘Those who brought were fed up and brought anyone whosoever could be available and anyhow maintained the gravity of the preceptor’s command. Well they brought someone and obeyed the command anyhow, but that Swami was also especially good.’ What a regard he has given honour as to an ‘Acharya’!’ In this way different kinds of remarks began to be made.</p>
<p class="Text">With due respect the disciples of Swamiji took away Gudar Baba to that bowl in which Shalgramji had been placed. But Babaji closed his eyes. Then, the prayer was made to him to open his eyes and look into the bowl. Anyhow after great insistence he opened his eyes and cast his look towards the bowl. Just when he saw, the Lord Shalgram came up the upper level of water. The sound of ‘Blessed-Blessed’ and ‘Jai-Jai’ resounded all around. The people began to say—‘He is the true Vaishnava’. The invaluable diamond was discovered in the garbage; he proved to be the true Vaishnava, whose Vaishnavism was beyond anyone’s imagination. Who can recognise such free from subtle desire expecting nothing frothright and indigent?</p>

<p class="Text">Then, that girl moved ahead to take the sacred water of the feet of that true Vaishnava devotee. But that strange Mahatma was not to agree so easily, He said—‘No, No, what is this all?’ At that time that girl said in the great pitious emotional tone—‘Lord! I am the goddess Vaishnavi. I had come here with the purpose of taking bath in the Triveni. But by the mistake of touchability I lost my power. That power will again come to me if I get the sacred water of your feet and I will depart for my world. That is why I am begging for your grace. The great and virtuous men are generous and kind-hearted. They share the grief of others. Please, show your mercy to my wretched condition and allow me to take the sacred water of your feet. </p>
<p class="Text">All were full of pity and astonished to hear her pathetic speech. Babaji said—‘Well, tell me, will you allow me also to accompany me to your world?’ The girl said—‘Yes, certainly, that is only for the men like you. You must stay there doubtlessly. This earth of the Kali age is not worthy of you. But the Lord! At least put off this tattered garment and keep your stick aside. Remain in the only loin cloth of banana and then accompany.’ But why was he to do so? He said—‘No, No, I will move with all these.’ What to do, being helpless she said—‘Well, as you wish; take these objects also with you.’</p>
<p class="Text">Baba gave away the sacred water of his feet. At once, the power of the goddess awakened and the agility to fly was created in her. She raised to the air way and said to Gudar baba,—‘Well, give me the hold of your stick? Baba gave her the hold of the hunchbacked portion of his stick and flew away with her. The people remained gazing this unique sight with wonder.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">A Child-Devotee</p>
<p class="Text">There lived an old saint in Vrindabandham. Only the creepers of the trees were his food materials. The constant movement in Kunjban was only his routine. Always remaining absorbed in the divine taste of the Lord, remaining oblivious of the body and remainging always drenching his cheeks with the spontaneous overflow of tears was his nature. There was a great attraction in him. Wherever he sat, the surrounding animals and birds surrounded him. Sometimes the calf rolled down in his feet and sometimes the pair of birds sat down on his hands. He fondled them, loved them and talked with them. ‘Go, graze-pick, now, I go.’ saying so he bade them farewell having uttered thus, and in the natural intoxicated state went away. By the permission of my preceptor I went there and prayed to him to accept me in his service. At that time the great man was strolling under a tree. A keen fragrance was spreading there; although there was no tree or flower. I was amazed to see that happening. The Mahatma paid his attention to my prayer. He said—‘Well, come, the friend of the last days. Stay here, do service whatever you may do. Here, there is no service at all now. But mind it that the dearest Lord may not be missed. Remain always chanting ‘Ram-Ram’. This is my service. Listen, what are the sparrows singing? ‘Repeat ‘Rama’, repeat ‘Ram’ My heart began to leap to hear these words of nectar. In the meantime the flute-tune was heard from somewhere. And then, the colour of intoxication what overpowered me is beyond my capacity to describe. That one the stealer of the cowmaid’s garments abducted my direct and indirect knowledge, meditation and concentration. I said—‘You robbed my entire property already and what was left with me that is my heart. If you stole that heart also from me by showing Your appearance, I would be free from every self-possession’. The Baba said—‘Ah! Why don’t you cast your look towards that distant rows of trees; it is there where the same Lord Krishna having the position with three bends of body is playing on His flute. Oh! what a spectacle of nature! loveliness in eyes and sweetness in the lower lip!’ My sight turned towards there. Just seeing that sight my heart, having come out, began to surge in the ocean of that splendour. I came to forget my own existence there. Then, what happened is not known to me. When I came to the consciousness I found that Mahatmaji was lifting  me up holding my hands and saying—‘My child! Repeat ‘Ram-Ram’ it is getting delay.’ I placed my head in the feet of Babaji. I said—‘It is the common saying of the people that service provides fruit. Here, I did not offer my service, I had come here only with the craving of service but without any effort I got dry fruits to eat to the best of my satisfaction by your grace.’ Baba said—‘Rise, let us move to the bank of Yamuna. There, hard service will be taken from you’. I came to be exhilarated and reached the bank of Yamuna along with Babaji. Sitting on a corner there Babaji said—‘Just see, this body has become much worn-out. I will change this body and transmigrate into another birth. You should not be worried. When the cloth is old, it is proper to change it then. I will not go to the Vaikuntha. I will take a new birth. Just I tell you where I will be born. After one year you will come there. The marks what are on my arms and my navel will be there on that body also; you can recognise to see these marks’. I got stunned to hear his words.’ Baba said again—‘When you meet me in the form of an infant, you will pronounce this ‘Mantra’ (spell) of thirteen letters—<span class="char-style-override-3">‘श्रीराम जय राम जय जय राम’</span> ‘Shri Ram, Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram’ for my sake—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">श्रियं रामं जयं रामं द्विर्जयं राममीरयेत्।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">त्रयोदशाक्षरो मन्त्रः सर्वसिद्धिकरः स्मृतः॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram’ remember this Mantra of thirteen letters which fulfils all the purposes.’</p>
<p class="Text">I committed this ‘Mantra’ to my memory. Then Babaji abandoned this body very easily. He refused to go to the Vaikuntha with the Lord’s messengers and having mounted on the astral plane departed for the ‘moon world’. The Lord’s messengers were amazed to see this. One of them said—<span class="char-style-override-3">‘संतकी मौज, मुक्ति निरादर भक्ति लुभाने।’</span> ‘It is the saint’s will to be attracted to the devotion instead of liberation.’ ‘When the Lord, Himself runs after him what will be the use of Vaikuntha for him?’ The second messenger said-Thus, busy in such a conversation they went back with that divine plane. By the grace of Babaji I saw all these occurences happening before my own eye-sight and became entitled of hearing the speech of the divine beings. Then, having committed to my memory carefully the ‘Mantra’ as instructed by Babaji and having performed the cremation rites of Babaji I set out for Kashi. Reaching there I narrated the entire occurence to my reverent ‘Guruji’ (Preceptor). He was very much pleased to hear this and he blessed in abundance. After one year Maharaj again gave permission to go to the village of the address according to the direction of Baba and know about the infant’. I also wanted this. I set out. I reached that village. I came to know that such a charming and modest baby was born in a particular house that he did not weep even to suck milk. I presumed that suck a baby could be only a great soul. I reached there. I sat at the gate. A girl came from the inside with the alms. I said—‘The renunciant take the cooked food and don’t accept the food material to cook and eat.’ She felt a great pleasure to hear this—She entered the house. She came out again with water, and having washed my feet, she took me inside the house. Having provided me with a beautiful seat she made me take the food with great love. When I came out after taking meal I sat on a square wood. Then, the same girl came with the infant in her lap. To see the marks on the body I came to recognise. Making obeisance in my mind I took the baby in my lap. At that time I felt a great joy. I pronounced the ‘mantra’ of thirteen letters. The infant began to stare at me. It gave me the unprecedented contentment. After fondling the baby for a while I again  shifted the child into the lap of the girl. That child remained looking towards me constantly till then. What should I narrate my condition? Neither it was being possible to move away nor to sidetrack. When that girl went away inside the house with the child, I stood from there and took up a posture under the ‘Chaldal’ tree on a pond out of the village. The next day, I came back to Kashi. I narrated the whole story of the child to Shri Guru Maharaj and got the infallible blessing. </p>
<p class="Text">After four years I was again commanded to go there. I had already curiosity in my mind; there was the need of permission only. I, at once, set off. While departing Shri Guru Maharaj gave advice, ‘This time you will stay there in the village having got a hut built and see the frolicsome activities of the saint child.’ I was very much pleased with this command. Reaching that village I began to live there in a hut. Daily after bath and meditation I reached the door of the child, played with the child and after taking begging I used to come back. One day, it occured an unprecedented happening. The child had two sisters-Bela and Chameli. Bela had a pet parrot. It were the days of winter. Below the square platform of Mahavirji Bela was amusing the child. The parrot was also there in a cage. I reached there at the same time. I attracted the child’s attention towards me by the pronunciation of the Mantra. The grave child recited a stanza full of fundamental truth in the profound words. In the proportion as he was going on saying in the clear words in the same proportion the parrot. Bela and I, myself went on repeating it as the spell bound—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">बिलसत कमल पर इक प्रान॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कौन सर सों कमल उपजा कहाँ छिति परमान। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कवन भँवरा जलज जोहै परखि लेह सुजान॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">शेष कार्य अशेष कारण परे आतम आन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">संत सदगुरु दया होतहि सहज प्रगटत ज्ञान॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is only the man of realization who can know source of the soul; the lotus on which it enjoys the  rapture. They are only the person; of knowledge who are well acquainted with the supreme knowledge and absolute truth and that can be acquired by a true preceptor and a saint in true sense.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thereafter the parrot, having come out of the cage sat on the arm of the child. That wonderful child got it seated in the palm of his hand holding it and having risen up singing ‘Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram’ began to dance. The anklet and girdle began to create musical sound. Bela saw that the brother had gone tired of dancing; she, too, having lifted him in her lap began to dance singing the same ‘Mantra’. I, also could not check myself. Taking the child from her lap I got him mounted on my shoulders and I also began to dance singing the same ‘Mantra’. The pleasure what I got in that song cannot be imagined even by an Emperor. In the meanwhile the people of the surroundings happened to gather there being attracted and the child got down from shoulder. He got the parrot go inside the cage and sat squat. Bela was also sitting silently and I, too, sat down observing silence thinking of the mystery of the frolic seriously. The visitors remained gazing with lingering look. In that atmosphere of stillness none could dare to ask any one anything. Slowly and slowly learning the lesson of peace all of them engaged themselves in their own business. I remained controlling my mental condition with the support of wisdom. On making the retrospection of the entire occurence, I came to conclude that all the frolicsome activities had happened by the influence of the child devotees power of consciousness. Due to being acquainted with the mystery I was not at all astonished by this wonderful frolic but the doubt was created in Bela’s mind and she got afraid. It was determined in her mind that her brother had been overpowered by any god. He asked me to support her mind—‘Swamiji, just see! How innocent is my brother, still he stammers while speaking, he is yet not literate, but suddenly he began to hymn the stanzas about Vishnu like a learned old ancestor. How wonderful it is, which is beyond presumption, that is what happened. Probably, the ghost of any learned one had overpowered his mind for a while. He made us all to dance. Now, he is free from the influence of the ghost. Just see, he is sitting very silently as if nothing has happened. I asked that goddess—‘What did you experience joy or sorrow in this song and dance?’ She said—‘Boundless joy as can never be possible’. I said to her—‘When you have felt joy, know it then that he was not under the influence of any ghost; it was the Lord under whose influence he was; because ghost causes sorrow and the Lord causes delight. The God is omnipresent. He is present in your heart, in my heart and in the heart of all beings, it is He who performs the frolicsome activities; we are puppet of His hand. The same God protects us. Then, what is the matter of fear?’ It came to the understanding of Bela, she became pleased. I warned her not to discuss this event to anyone; but to enjoy it by remembering it in the mind, here, lies your welfare.’ She went home with the child and I also came back to my hut with the alms. </p>
<p class="Text">As the Lord’s childish activities are joy giving, similarly the child-frolics of the saints are in any way not less joy giving; because it is a great mistake to create any kind of difference between the Lord and His devotees.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">Nanhu Bhagat</p>
<p class="Text">There is a place, named Serwaghat at the distance of eight miles in the East from Shri Ayodhyadham on the bank of Saryuji, it is here where is the hermitage of Shringi Rishi; which is recognised as the sixteenth holy place of pilgrimage under Ayodhya. The devotee about whom I want to discuss here, his birth place is in any village located in the surroundings of this very place. I forget the name of the village. This devotee used to graze the cows. Till the revolt of 1857 the ‘Ramlila’ used to be organised at the hermitage of Shringi Rishi. So, he was fortunate to get the opportunity of visiting the fair on the festive of ‘Ramlila’ for a number of years in his childhood while grazing the cows on the bank of Sarayu river. When the demonstration of ‘Ramlila’ used to be closed, leaving the cows to graze in the wide cattle ground, these cowherd boy devotees used to meditate Shri Ram-Lakshman having closed their eyes for a number of hours sitting in any secluded place.</p>
<p class="Text">The people called the ‘Bhaktji’ (devotee) by the name of ‘Nanhu Bhagat’. He was ‘Ahir’ by caste. When the tumult of revolt broke out, this poor devotee, having run away from Faizabad district began to live in a sheded house of the village, named Gopiyapar of Basti district. His mother was alive for the time being but his father had died in his childhood. It was the village Gopiyapar where his marriage had been ceremonised. His wife was also a dedicated devotee. He was the owner of fourteen Bighas of land. This was the source of his livelihood. A few children were born but they passed away early. So, this was only the couple who lived and depended on the farming only to pull on their lives. If any hermit or saint happened to visit their hut, they served him reverently. They used to listen to ‘Shrimadbhagawat’ once in a year. Since my childhood I had been oberving him lean and thin of long body and the man of strong bones. The lady devotee had gone blind, so the farming was got done by the ploughman. The rosary beed of Tulasi (basil plant) used to be constantly counted in their hands. The couple’s method of counting the muttering of ‘Ram-Nam’ was strange. They didn’t know at all about the counting of lakhs and crores. They were not literate at all; they used to have one Kg. of pulse grain or peas and one rosary was completed, they picked up one grain and placed it in the next pot. In this way, when all the grains of one Kg. were finished, the devotee said—‘O the lady devotee! My one Kg. has been completed.’<span class="char-style-override-5">1</span> On the otherside the lady devotee also said in the competition—‘Devotee! It is you who is my Lord, but I repeat the name of your Lord also; see, my one Kg. has also completed’.<span class="char-style-override-5">2</span> </p>
<p class="xfootnote">1. Lady devotee! my one Kg. has been completed.</p>
<p class="xfootnote">2. You are my lord; but I repeat your God's name. Well, my one Kg. also completed.</p>
<p class="Text">In this way; the both passed their lives very joyfully. In due course of time, by the company of a very proved saint their condition raised very high. It had become natural for them to get the apparent sight of the Lord moment after moment. On the death of the lady devotee, the devotee donated the capital of seven hundred rupees and the grain and the bullocks what were in his house to the cowshed. He gave the field-production on share and taking the grain weighing one quarter of Kg. from that daily easily he began to pull on his life with that. Now, it was his only job to repeat the Lord’s Name being free from the pair of opposites. He narrated me many occurences out of which one or two events I write here.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, Bhaktji (the devotee) was offering sacred water to the sun after offering water to the ‘Tulasi’ and ‘Peepal’; but just on closing eyes being devoid of the outer knowledge he sees that the whole world has been illuminated. He remained absorbed in the same condition for a long time. When the lady devotee approaching him awakened, smiling again and again he described that indescribable scene to the best of his capacity what he could in his own village dialect. Thereafter for many years on the ‘Suryardh-donation’ time he remained seeing in the same way. To see his such behaviour the villagers had began to call him mad. Bhagatji also became mad silently, he didn’t prefer to be deprived of this joy by showing himself to be clever.</p>
<p class="Text">After some days at the night time in the month of December-January, the emotion of love raised in his mind and he began to gabble—‘Dada! You would be possessing only a single black blanket and in this cold you would be grazing the cows in Vrindaban, you would be shivering from cold badly. O the Lord of meek! Should I cover your body with my quilt?’ Shedding tears again and again he remained praying. It was about One O’ clock in the night he came to sleep, then what he sees that the Lord Krishna having manifested in a child form said—‘Devotee! O devotee! I feel cold.’ The devotee said—‘Who is Jagdeo? (a neighbouring boy)?’ Then, the Lord said—‘O! Till this moment you were calling Me with tears in your eyes and now you say—‘Jagdeo! Jagdeo! ‘Now, I go away.’ Now, the devotee came to his consciousness, he rose up and ran after—‘Who is! Dada! The Lord of meek! The Lord of meek!’</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever it may be, after shedding tears Bhagatji reposed on his cot. He was repenting closing his eyes when from inside the quilt the stars began to be visible to him as if there were no covering of the quilt or the thatch of the house. After a while such a bright illumination surging big waves came to be visible to him that had no beginning and end. Surging in the same Bhagatji reached Saket. There he got the apparent sight of his deity Shri Rama, Shri Lakshman, Hanuman etc., all. Then, having saluted prostrating his  body he asked the question—‘Maharaj! Where is the Prince Bharat?’ Just then, Bharatji also appeared before his sight. (Here, there are so many such matters to describe but there is neither time nor space) After some time he got inspected the place in the same world to make his abode. His most reverent a great soul and the place of the secret preceptor of the writer of these lines was also shown to him. Thus, the devotee’s feelings became apparent to him. The next day, the humble one came to me running and related his whole story to me. In my evil mind the thought of his being mad began to be strengthened. That humble old remained narrating his story saying ‘Maharaj! Maharaj!’ And I remained smiling considering him a blockheaded mad. What a great meanness of mine it was! Now, I feel a great remorse to think of it. The next day, in the night Bhaktaji again began to express his same feeling of that winter and grazing the cows with tears in his eyes before his ‘Dinanath’ (the Lord of meeks). In the twinkling of an eye a boy began to rebuke Bhagatji showing His flute again and again—‘O the fool! You disclosed all the matters to............ him. Now, to you .............. ‘ On this scolding the poor Bhagatji showing his good sense for me, made pleading to that boy with flute very meekly for my sake.</p>
<p class="Text">The next day, the humble Bhagatji who was really a friend of my father, came with the support of a stick and began to say to me in a secluded place—‘O the child of a Brahman! You should not do any such act, which is against God’s pleasure. Well, just tell me why did you consider me mad? If you had not faith why did you make the artificial talk to me? Could I ever be angry with you?’ Now, I came to tremble with fear. that ‘I did not only insult a God-devotee but what a great hypocrat am I?’ Thus, repenting I went to a great soul with Bhagatji, narrated my story to him, To hear all that the saintly soul assured me.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the humble Bhagatji was going home by the Western path of the Jungle Kathar in the night. On the way, a very defamed bull who killed the men in the night, came to reach him on the way bellowing. He found no way and began to say to the Lord—‘Ah, Dinanath! (the Lord of meek) Ah; Dinanath!! This big bull will kill me today. It is You, who will be blamed here that Nanhu was the God devotee and the bull killed him and he became a ghost’. In the meantime what Bhagatji sees that a very handsome twelve years old child having placed his hand on back of the bull, twisting his tail and driving the bull before the devotee, is moving towards the other side. For a while Bhagatji was nonplussed, but soon he came to understand that the Lord was responsible for all this occurence. With great love making obeisance, smiling, weeping, dancing he came to his hut.</p>
<p class="Text">A few years passed when this simple lover devotee, having abandoned this mortal body like a renounced saint departed for the Supreme abode.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">Devotee-Uddhavaramji Brahmachari</p>
<p class="Text">The devotee Uddhavaramji was born in the Badaun district. He was dispassionate since his birth. He considered all the worldly objects as straw and having the feeling of the insubstantiality of this world in his mind, he always remained sad to see the beings badly involved in it. His elder brother was a great God-devotee. It is prevalent that he had got the apparent sight of the Lord several times. In his very childhood the seed of Shri Krishna’s devotion had germinated in his heart to hear the loud chanting of divine names and the praise of the Lord’s virtues and slowly and slowly he had developed the detachment from the world. Once, his elder brother went to Haridwar to take bath on the bank of the holy Bhagawati Bhagirathi. His body was horripilated merely by the touch of the water of the holy Ganga. At the same time his heart was enlightened with the divine light and affectionate to the devotee and blissful Lord Shri Krishna, having appeared before him, blessed him with the idol of Shalgram as a gesture of His mercy. On returning home he narrated this story to Uddhavaramji and he got that idol demanded from him. Daily he worshipped that idol according to the religious rules which gave him great peace. Once, his heart was enlightened with knowledge and the desire was created in him to visit the places of the Lord’s frolicsome activities. Then, there was a command to him in his dream to go to Shribadrikashram and there he would get the sight of Shri Krishnanand Brahmchari and he should accept him as his preceptor.</p>
<p class="Text">According to the Lord’s command he reached Badrikashram. Thus, getting the beautiful glimpse of Shribadarikashram being overwhelmed by love he fainted and fell down on the ground. At the same time by luck Shri Krishnanandji came there with the craving of the Lord’s sight. Overpowered by love his mind was attracted towards Uddhavaramji in the natural way to see him and having lifted him he embraced him to his heart thus, he became conscious. To see the feature—his garments and appearance his dream became fresh in his memory and he fell down on the feet of the great soul and made him his preceptor. Swamiji initiated him ‘Mantra’ (spell) just to hear which he fainted to be overwhelmed by emotion of joy and fell down on the ground. After some days he came home in Badayun with his preceptor. He stayed there with his preceptor for some time; then on his command he went away to ‘Shirpur’ (a place in Bombay Province). There being absorbed in the regular service of his preceptor and in the worship of ‘Mahadeo’, named Pataleshwar he began to pass his time. After some time his preceptor went away to a place famous by the name of Bimbaleshwar situated on the bank of Narmada. It shocked him very much; but considering it the Lord’s will he accepted it reverentially and he began to pass his whole time in worship of the Lord and in the service of Shri Pataleshwar.</p>
<p class="Text">Once he developed an ardent loving for the direct vision of Lord Shiva. He used to worship the idol of Shiva in the temple of Shri Pataleshwar.  But today he became specially impatient to have the vision of Shiva.  He, going before the before the Shiva’s idol began to pray ‘O Lord! What is that fault committed by me as a result of which still I am deprived of Your sight? Lord! as I have heard that you are highly kind-hearted, then, why don’t you shower your grace on me? It is true that I am downfallen, but my Lord! You are called the purifier of the downfallens. It is right that I am unable to worship you according to the ordained religious rules, but my Lord! An epithet of ‘Ashutosh’ i.e., You are to be easily pleased. You are to shower Your grace without any reason. Then, O Lord! Why don’t you bless me with Your sight. Lord! Show your mercy to me. Why have You kept this servant deprived of the gain of Your sight till now? While uttering so being overpowered by the emotion of love he began to weep bitterly before the image of Shri Chandrasekhar. Just hearing the call of the devotee the affectionate to His devotee, the Lord having appeared apparently, embraced the devotee to His heart. To see the Lord present before his eyes, his eyes were filled with tears of love and his throat choked. He tried to pray hymn to the Lord; but due to deeply immersed in the emotion of love he could not pray. When the Lord Chandramauli placed His boonful hand on his head, he offered his prayer to the Lord in many ways. It pleased the Lord excessively and He asked him to demand the boon. But he who has already realized the worthlessness of the world, why will he care for the pleasures of this world? What can be that particular prosperity for which there can be any desire in the mind of the man before whom the Lord of all the three worlds Himself, is standing? At last on the Lord’s insistence he said—‘O the affectionate to the meeks! It is only Your graceful look that removes the entire anguish and sorrows. You have blessed me with Your sight showing mercy to me, now, I have no desire remaining with me. But if it is Your will and You are pleased with me then be graceful to me to grant me boon that my deep love and devotion may be established in Your feet forever and my soul may merge into You’ Having granted the prayer of the devotee the Lord Shankar said—‘Be it so’! The soul of Shri Uddhavaramji departed from this body before the Lord and merged into the Suprme being.</p>

<p class="Text">The foremost devotee Swami Haridas was the devotee having steadfastness in God. He was a Sanadhya Brahman and contemporary to the Emperor Akabar. It is said that from the very childhood the blackbee of his mind had got entangled in drinking the flower juice of Shyam Sundar’s fresh cloudy like lotus face. He who gets the taste of the least joy of the Lord Hari’s nectar begins to feel indifferent from all the worldly comforts, enjoyments and all the worldly tastes and pleasures begin to seem tasteless to him. Swamiji was a great relinquisher, detached and and lover, due to being unable to check the strong overflow of devotion he had began to live at Vrindaban, the holy place of Shyamsundar’s frolics, having left his own birth place and considering the most charming of all the three world the Lord Shri Krishna, the constellation of love as the dearest of heart he used to think of himself His ever female friend.</p>
<p class="Text">It is said that his whole time passed in the meditation of the Lord’s daily exploits. His all the life routines as eating-drinking, sleeping-rising, singing-playing used to be performed with the captivating loving Lord Krishna, time to time charming appearance of the Lord used to be before his divine eye-sight. He, sometimes, made prayer to the Lord, sometimes played with Him, sometimes made amusement with Him; sometimes served Him, sometimes ate with Him, sometimes appeased Him to sing and play music, sometimes started dancing and sometimes being overwhelmed by the emotion of love he used to be unconscious outwardly. There are the rare Lord’s devotees who reach such a condition of the highest joy. </p>
<p class="Text">One day, one of his disciples brought a grand phial of scent to gift him as present. At that time Swamiji Maharaj was in the rapturous state on the bank of Yamuna. The devotee gave the phial in his hand. He also took it in his emotional state. It is said that at that time he was enjoying the colourful Holi with Brajkishore (Krishna) absorbed in the meditation and the Lord, Himself was rubbing Gulal on his body. Just getting the scent phial Swamiji poured down it on the Lord’s body. In the eyes of the disciple that scent fell down in the sand on the ground. It caused some displeasure to his mind. After sometime when Swamiji came to his physical consciousness being aware of the disciple’s mental vexation he began to say—‘Well brother! Just go and see the sight of Shri Behariji’ He, at once, went into the temple. The fragrance of the scent was spreading in the whole temple and all the limbs of Bihariji’s body were drenched with the scent. Then, his eyes were opened; he developed his full faith in the devotion of Swamiji and returning from there he fell down on his feet. His gift of scent proved worthful.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, an emotional person approached Swamiji to become his disciple and he presented an invaluable diamond in gift to him. Swamiji came to know the fact that he had a great attachment with this diamond. So long as the attachment and great love continues with any worldly object there cannot be established the true love with that ‘Sanware’ (Lord Krishna) the Supreme of the dearest among the dearest ones. Thinking so he said—‘Go, and throw away this diamond into the Yamunaji at once.’ According to the command of Swamiji he threw out the diamond into the flow of the Yamunaji undoubtedly, but this diamond remained haunting his mind and he felt some mental vexation also for throwing away the invaluable diamond in this way. Having come to know his mind Swamiji began to think that still his attachment with the stone could not go out of his mind; so, holding his hand he took him away to a forest and to show him the lump of the diamonds he began to say—‘Brother! If you have love with these stones you may take out as many diamonds as you like, but mind it that all these objects are the great obstacle in the attainment of the Lord’s love. When there is attachment with worldly enjoyments, how is the love possible in the Lord? These worldly objects are as if the plunderers on the way of the Lord’s attainment—‘So long as you remain indulged in the worldly affairs, neither your mind will be concentrated unshakably to the worry-freeing Shri Hari’s lotus-feet and nor can you be fulfilled to drink the nectar of the ocean of Supreme bliss. So, if you want to attain the Lord Hari, who protects us from the fears of the world; detach your mind from the stone-like diamonds that rob us of our true happiness.’</p>
<p class="Text">To see this wonderful scene and to hear the sermons of Swamiji his mind was completely detached from the sensual objects of the world and he surrendered unconditionally to him. Considering him deserving Swamiji initiated him and made him grateful to guide him the easy way of spiritual practice.</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji Maharaj was well experienced of music and quite expert in it. The famous master of music Tansen, the courtier of Akabar was his disciple. Being charmed by Tansen’s art of music one day, Akabar asked him the name of his Guru (teacher) and when Tansen said—‘My preceptor is God-devotee Swami Haridasji and he lives at Vrindavana’, Akabar expressed his desire to meet him. Tansen said—‘Your majesty! It is impossible to call him here; because he doesn’t have the least care of wealth and honour; if you have the desire, you, yourself, move there.’ Akabar went to the hut of Swamiji along with Tansen. At that time Swamiji was reciting the stanza of a poem being overwhelmed by love before the Lord. Akabar was amazed to hear it. Then, Tansen recited a stanza and knowingly he committed mistake at one or two places in the tune and metre. Then, Swamiji Maharaj, himself, began to sing the same stanza. To hear the stanza the consciousness of all was filled with the Lord’s love. Akabar wished to gift a lot to Swamiji, but the detached Haridasji accepted nothing. Akabar came back to Delhi with Tansen. One day, Akabar again got Tansen to sing the same stanza; but he didn’t get that pleasure Then, the Emperor said to Tansen—‘That day, it had given a great pleasure to hear the stanza; but today why didn’t it give the joy of that day?’ Tansen said—‘O the sustainer of the country! How can I get that taste? Swamiji was making the Lord of all the three worlds listen the stanza being under the sway of the Lord’s love and I am singing to appease the emperor of Delhi. This is its main reason.’ The emperor also considered it right to think so. </p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji has composed many stanzas also. There are many stanzas related to the plays of Shri Radhe-Krishna composed by him. Those stanzas are called ‘Kelimala’, He has composed many poems on doctrine also. In his stanzas there seems some mistakes also concerning to prosody, but the stream of love and devotion that flows in them all the mistakes are washed away. In the form of music his stanzas are perfect. The name of his sect is ‘Tatti Sampradaya’. The famous relinquishers, lover and proved saints have already glorified that sect. One stanza of his warning is as follows—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">हरिके नामको आलस क्यों।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">करत है रे काल फिरत सर साँधै। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">हीरा बहुत जवाहिर संचे, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कहा भयो हस्ती दर बाँधै॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">देर कुबेर कछू नहिं जानत, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">चढ़ो फिरत है काँधै। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कह हरिदास कछू न चलत जब, </p>
<p class="SHLOK">आवत अन्तकी आँधै॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Why to be lazy in remembering the Lord’s name? The death is moving fast stretching the arrow in the bow. The jeweller saves the diamond very carefully but what is its use and what is the use of keeping the elephant on the door. The death knows nothing like the immense wealth which you save so confidently. Haridas says that when the last time of death comes nothing goes with you. The soul goes alone leaving after the entire wealth and property’.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">Thakur Uddharndutt</p>
<p class="Text">In the last of the fifteenth century there was a very rich town named Saptgram situated on the bank of Saraswati river under Hugali District. A very wealthy businessman, named Shrikardutt began to live coming there. Shrikardutt was was a famous Vaisya belonging to the Shandilya clan. He had become a great reverential to the inhabitants of that place due to his generosity, kind-heartedness and righteousness. He left no stone unturned in helping the hungry, orphans and afflicted persons. His wife, Bhadravati was also amiable, bearing moral character, husband-devotee, kind-hearted and righteous. From the womb of this Bhadravati devi the great God-devotee Shri Uddharandutt was born in Shak 1403. In due course of time he was imparted education. After his father’s death it was Uddharandutt who became the heir of his entire property. At the same time Uddharandutt purchased some land and having inhabitted it, he named it Uddharanpur on his name which is present even today near ‘Katve’. Similar to his father the son also proved to be beneficant, bearing moral conduct and God-devotee. On account of his kind-heartedness the then Nawab of Bengal Sultan Hussain Shah gave him great respect.</p>
<p class="Text">It was then when the most favourite of the Lord Chaitanyadeo, Shri Nityanandji was giving the nectar of sermons on Lord’s name in Bengal, Thakur Uddharandutt, having taken initiation of Hari’s Name from him became absorbed in love and having made his son, Shri Niwas the owner of his entire immeasurable property, set off for Somnath Puri and began to live there comfortably getting propitiatory of ‘Shri Mahaprabhu’ (the Great God). Having shifted from there to Shri Brindavanadham he began to live there. There is such a popular saying that being pleased with his devotion the most adorable ‘Mahavidya’ ‘Shaktiswarupini’ Goddess Durga used to bless him with her apparent sight from time to time. One of some events of his life which is full of devotion is being mentioned here.</p>
<p class="Text">The women of Bengal used to wear bangle of conch shell in their hands. There these bangles are called ‘Shankha’ and its sellers are called ‘Shankhari’. One day any ‘Shankhari’ came to the village Saptgram to sell the ‘Shankha’. While moving about on the bank of Saraswati river a twelve years old girl came to him and said—‘Make me wear the ‘Shankha’. When the ‘Shankhari’ having made her wear the ‘Shankha’ demanded the price she said—‘At present I am going to take bath, I have no money with me, you, go to Uddharandutt ask him—‘I have made your daughter wear the bangles (Shankha), Please pay me its price! The Shankhari said—‘If he doesn’t believe in my words, how will I get its price?’ The girl said—‘You, will tell him that due to having no money with her, she has asked to say at the uddharandutt’s house that five golden coins are lying in the Western side row of the room of the East direction; he should give them. In case, you don’t get the price even then, you will come here and get back your ‘Shankha’ from me.’ The Shankhari felt assured. The girl went away towards the river and the Shankhari moved towards the house of Uddharandutt. Reaching there when he asked for the Price, uddharandutt said—‘I have no daughter at all, then, whom did you make the ‘Shankha’ wear?’ To hear this the Shankhari said about the five golden coins. Uddharandutt went inside the house and found that actually five golden coins had been placed at the mentioned place. To see the coins he got amazed as where did these golden coins come from? In case, anyone placed it by mistake then how did it come to the knowledge of any unknown person? Doubtlessly, there is some divine frolic. Just at once coming out of the house Uddharandutt asked the Shankhari—‘Can you show me that girl? He answered—‘Yes, my lord! Accompany me to the bank of the Saraswati river, she has gone there to take bath.’ Uddharandutt accompanied the Shankhari. But neither on the bank of Saraswati river nor on the way that girl was visible. Shankhari began to weep to think of his this behaviour with an honourable man with the fear of punishment. In the meanwhile the Shankhari and Uddharandutt and the other ones present there saw that two hands came up the water of the Saraswati river, both the hands had two Shankha. Shankhari got a confidence to see this. Uddharandutt, too fell down on his feet experiencing the grace of the ‘Mother’ on him and said—‘Brother Shankhari! Really, you are the most fortunate, you are the real worthy son of your mother, today, the mother goddess, herself, came to you and wore the bangles. Uddharandutt bade farewell to the Shankhari after giving him a number of golden coins. Such kinds of so many tales concerning to the direct experience of the Lord’s grace to Uddharandutt are heard.</p>
<p class="Text">Uddharandutt was jeweller by caste. Having toured about with Shri Nityanandji in most of the parts of Bengal he had made the publicity of the most mysterious ‘Vaishnavadharma’. Compassion on the living creatures, interest in the Lord’s Name and ‘Vaishnava’ service were the subject matters of his publicity.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, in the age of fiftyseven years in 1460 shaka he died in Vrindavana. Even today, near ‘Banshibat’ Shri Uddharandutt’s famous tomb-temple is situated and every year thousands of travellers consider themselves most fortunate to offer a handful of flowers on the temple of his tomb with reverence.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-15">Devotee-Devaji Pujari</p>
<p class="Text">Near Udaipur there is a temple of ‘Shri Rupchaturbhuj Swami.’  Devaji Panda was the priest in that temple. He was not very learned but made the Lord’s adoration in the prescribed way with love and devotion. He had firm faith in the Lord, which is the most necessary means for the devotion. By his practice of Lord’s worship the darkness of his ignorance had been frittered away. </p>
<p class="Text">It was one day when the king of Udaipur visited the temple after the first watch of the night. The ceremonial adoration of the God in the night before sleep had already been performed. The Lord had gone to relax. Having rocked the Lord to sleep Devaji having taken off the garland of flower from the neck of the Lord, had put it on his head and having closed the inner curtain of the temple he was coming out—at the same time Maharana reached there. To see Maharana on the gate suddenly Devaji being perturbed entered the temple and began to search out the garland of the Lord to offer him to wear. That day, there was not any other garland, so to appease Maharana that he might not get annoyed, he took off the garland of flower from his head and dropped it in the neck of Maharana. There was no time to think and discuss. All the hairs of Devaji’s head had grown white and the hairs were long. One or two white hairs of his head being clinged to the garland came to the neck of Maharana. To see the hairs Rana passed a taunting remark—‘Pujariji (the priest)! It seems that all the hairs of the Lord have grown white.’ Devaji finding no way to answer said in haste fearing—‘Your majesty! All the hairs of Thakurji have grown white. Rana came to laugh at this answer of Pujariji (the priest). Side by side he got annoyed also in his mind with Pujariji. He said in serious mood—‘Tomorrow, I myself, will come in the morning and see,’ Having uttered so he went away back. </p>
<p class="Text">Devaji did say in haste so, but he was worried very much. In the morning Rana will come and not to get the white hair of the Lord what will be in his mood is not known. It came to the mind of Devaji—‘The Lord is eternal ever navel, tender and ever young; His dark curly hairs always remain adding to the charm of His body, whose least charming and sweet smile brightens the whole world and the whole world is charmed to see his ever flourishing youthful dark body as the limit of charm and beauty, the chief of beauty Goddess Lakshmi constantly remains absorbed in whose service, where will this old age come from in that Lord ever embellished with the divine blooming youth? How will His hairs be white? Swinging in realm of thought in this way the old priest of the Lord, devotee Devaji came to be very restless.</p>
<p class="Text">Sleep took flight from the eyes of Devaji, he was already without food. The tears overflowed from his eyes. Devaji said—‘My Lord! Such words came out of my mouth abruptly. You are ever navel and young. How can be possible Your white hair? But in the morning when Rana comes and finds Your hair black, what will be the condition of Your this servant? In the eyes of Rana this priest will be proved completely false speaking. I have neither devotion nor reverence in me. I only pull on my sinful life by offering You Tulasi, Chandan merely. I don’t worship you but worship my belly only; but the people call me Your priest. When in the morning getting my words false Maharana will reproach me openly before all, the people will only criticise me what a great fool I am! Is it possible that the hair of the Lord and of an idol even can be white? Some will address me as the most coward and some will say—‘O! If the God had been so true or affectionate to His devotees; Would He not protect this poor priest by proving his words true? It is said that He had come out bursting the pillar to keep the words of Prahlad. To protect the shame of Draupadi her Sari had become endless. To save Radharani from the infamy the water had been got brought in the earthen pot of hundreds of holes by her. Then, what is it an uphill task to change His hair white?’ Different words from different mouths. Lord! How will Your this offender, hypocrat priest show his face at that time? And what will he answer to all? But Lord! How should I please and pray to you to become old Babaji with white hair by accepting the old age to keep my words? So, do what pleases You.’</p>
<p class="Text">Having uttered so Devaji burst into tears. In such a way the night passed in wailing and crying and calling the God. The whole world was asleep. None heard the pathetic call of Deva. It was only Deva’ who was awakened and Deva’s God who always remains awakened and listens to the secrets of anyone’s heart. Affectionate to His servants, the protector of those seeking shelter to Him, the Lord heard the most heart-touching call of His priest Devaji. How would He ignore it as He is the lord of orphanes, the supporter of distressed ones, the friend of those fallen into calamity, the supporter of the destitute, the wealth to the poor and the only shelter to the orphans? To keep the words of the devotee the Lord acted a sportive display. All the hair of the four armed Lord grew white: How auspicious! </p>
<p class="Text">Having finished the work of routine bath, trembling with fear Devaji opened the inner door of the temple. His heart was throbbing with fear. Just opening the door he saw—‘All the hair of benedictory and divine tree of the grace, the Lord’s idol have grown white.’ Now the condition of Deva’s heart is strange—‘is it dream or reality! To see this immense grace and the affectionate feeling to the helpless of the ocean of compassion, being overwhelmed by love and mad in rapture Deva lost his outer consciousness. Being senseless he fell down on the ground and reached the divine world and being charmed began to take the taste of the nectar of the intoxicating flower juice of the Lord’s Lotus-feet. He remained lying in the same condition for a long time. It is not known in this outer senseless condition what other delightful enjoyment and the peculiar rapture beyond the world he enjoyed and how much he experienced!</p>
<p class="Text">After a long time Deva’s trance was broken. His both the eyes were raining the cool tears of love and rapture. In the meantime Maharana reached to testify. To see Devaji weeping in restlessness he thought that, ‘no doubt, he did say in the night but he is weeping due to fear now. In the meantime his eye-sight fell on the Lord’s idol, just to see Rana got drowned in the ocean of wonder—‘all the hairs of Shyamsunder were brightening like the white silver. Maharana could not believe it. He thought—‘The Priest has pasted some white hair to bring it from anywhere.’ Rana thought to test it and at once, he rooted out one hair of the Lord’s head forcibly with his own hand. Rana saw, ‘while rooting out the hair the idol felt as if pain and the contraction arose on his nose. Not only this but the drop of blood also came out of the head while rooting out the hair and it fell down on the garments of Rana. Just seeing Rana fainted and fell down on the ground.</p>
<p class="Text">By the end of complete first watch Maharana came to his consciousness. Holding Devaji’s feet he said—‘Lord! I am a great fool, faithless and dull-witted. I have committed a great crime. The devotees are of forgiving nature as I have heard. Kindly, pardon me for my crime—‘protect me.’ Uttering so he began to wash the feet of Devaji with his tears. Having lifted him up Deva embraced Maharana to his heart—‘said in choking voice—‘This is all the Lord’s grace. I, uneducated backward was engaged in the service of the stmoach only. The Lord’s worship was only nominal. But how kind-hearted is my Lord that He was pleased with my false worship and to keep the words of a worthless like me He created the strange white hair on the ever young tender idol. What should I forgive-I, myself am a great culprit. King! I had committed a crime against you as well as the Lord, both by telling a lie. But He is so affectionate to the poor that not paying attention to the grief of the offender He is enchanted on his meekness.’ Rana and Deva both were weeping to remember the Lord’s gracefulness.</p>
<p class="Text">Just after this occurence the order was placed that in future after having been enthroned any one of the Rana dynasty will not be allowed to enter the temple. He will be authorised to enter the temple only till he is the prince.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-16">Devotee-King Jaimallsinghji</p>
<p class="Text">The king Jaimallsinghji was the king of Medata. He was a big diplomat, of moral conduct, of saintly nature,  and firm determined God-devotee. Although he performed all the royal affairs remembering the Lord, yet he worshipped and meditated God in seclusion regularly in the morning till the first and half watch of the day. None was allowed to meet him in this period to do for any, even most urgent piece of work. He remained sunk in the ocean of rapture of the Lord’s worship in such a way that his meditation was not interrupted by any outer hindrance. At that time his inner and outer sights both were united and became one and before that sight there remained only Shyam Sunder’s unique charming appearance of all the three worlds. If by luck anyone happened to see his overwhelming love and stability in meditation he was forcibly attracted towards the Lord’s love. In this regular daily adoration certainly many obstacles were faced. Several matters of royal affair came to be handled but Jaimall did not deviate from his resolve.</p>
<p class="Text">The matter of Jaimall’s this resolve spread all around far and wide. A muslim Nawab used to remain hostile to Jaimall due to his greed, jealousy and perversity.  He was in the search of an opportunity to torment him. When he came to know about his resolve, one day in the morning time he came to Medata with his big army and surrounded the capital from all sides. The people informed the royal court about it. It was the strict order of the king not to wage any war against anyone without his permission, so the minister of the state sent the information in the palace; but none could approach the king Jaimall at that time. Ultimately the royal mother could not check herself. By the fear of the destruction of the kingdom the royal mother gathered the courage to approach her son in his cell. Reaching there she saw—Jaimall is sitting absorbed in deep meditation; he is quite unaware of the outer knowledge, the tears of love are shedding from his eyes and amidst this he happens to laugh the laughter of a unique rapture. An unparallel bright  light of lustre is spreading on his face. The royal mother first stopped for a while but with the possibility of the son’s harm she said—‘Son! The enemy has attacked, some way should be found out.’ Jaimall’s consciousness was anchored in the charming appearance of the Lord. Nothing was heard to him. When even after three to four calls there was no response, the mother shook Jaimall’s body with her hands. After the interruption of his meditation Jaimall opened his eyes in amazement. He felt a great vexation in his mind but to see the gloomy face of his mother standing before his eyes his sentiment changed at once and he made obeisance to his mother. The mother gave him the news of the enemy’s attack but Jaimall had no time at this time to hear about any other matter except the Lord’s meditation. He wanted to persuade his mother meekly but his sense organs were being attracted forcibly towards the Lord’s appearance, who to persuade? Jaimall could utter no word and his meditation started. The mother said again, then from the mouth of the devotee Jaimall who had full faith in God only the word came out—‘The Lord always does all good.’ Thereafter his eyes were closed. Far beyond the feeling of joy-sorrow, loss-gain and victory-defeat he entered the sphere of the most charming love of the eternal bliss. The triffling storm of the world could not shake the solid firm Himalayan peak of his mind. Being disappointed the mother returned with heavy mind.</p>
<p class="Text">The war trumpet sounded; the army of the enemy began to enter the city facing no hindrance. Now bearing the responsibility who is affectionate to His devotee and safeguards the interest of His devotee, the Supreme Lord could not now check Himself. In the disguised form Virendra to cause all the three worlds tremble, Shyam Sunder, well armed suddenly appeared amidst the large army of the enemy Maharaj Raghuraj Singhji writes—</p>

With the sword in His hand as if the death for the death He reached there where there was a big army, Like lightening He is assaulting the force of the enemy with His brightening sword. Raghuraj says that the Lord Krishna, the son of Vasudeo has appeared to fight the battle to protect the dignity and prestige of His foremost devotee.’</p>
<p class="Text">Brahma and the lord Yama creates and annihilates the creation on whose command, before that Supreme Lord what was the value of the petty Muslim army? In no time all tumbled down on the ground. Their merits proved fruitful today in every way. Being slayed by the hand of the Lord they attained the highest riches. The enemy Nawab having been wounded fell down on the ground. Within moment having served the purpose and having tied the horse in the stable the horse-rider disappeared.</p>
<p class="Text">On this side Jaimallji’s adoration was over. At once, he got his horse brought. What he sees that his horse is feeling tired, his body is getting wet with sweat and he is panting. The king asked—‘Who had mounted on this horse?’ But none gave any answer; really, none knew this secret at all. In the meantime the people came running and informed—‘The army of the enemy is lying dead.’ The king was astonished very much. Having forgotten about the horse he reached out of the city at once. There he finds the  heap of dead bodies and the opponent Nawab is lying wounded. Jaimall went to him and after the formal salutation with love he began to ask him about the war. He said with folded hands—‘Your majesty! Who is that exceedingly strong of wheatish image and of unique foremost charming appearance in your force? All alone he annihilated my entire army and injured me too, and knocked me down. Oh! What a peerless charming appearance he has! Since, I saw that youth, fascinating the minds of all the three worlds, my consciousness is getting restless to see Him again.’ Now, Jaimall came to understand that all this was the frolicsome activity of my Lord. His whole body got thrilled with joy. He said with the choked voice—‘Brother! You are blessed one, your good fortune will be appreciated by the Brahma even. Ah! my eyes are pining for that slight dark winsome, really, you are blessed one that you got His sight so easily.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Now, his whole hostile sentiment vanished. Jaimall made him reach his destination with due honour and comfort. Reaching there he, too, with his entire family members became the great devotee of the Lord.</p>
