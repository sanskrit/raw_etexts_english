title = "The culmination of the tAntrika education of an AtharvaNa"

+++
After having changed his yaj\~nopavIta, the dvija who has studied the
shruti of the bhR^igu-s and the a\~Ngiras goes to the preceptor to
unlock the great secret of the tantra. He recites the triShaptIya which
is the foundation of all bIja-s and in the morning recites the sUkta of
the maitrAvaruNi beginning with “prAtar agniM pratar indraM…”. He then
invokes the uShA-s as ordained in the tradition of the atharvan-s and
performs an Achamana. Then he invokes rAtrI. Having done this he
prepares for the worship of the glorious kubjIshana who is in the
embrace of mahA-prachaNDa-kubjikA-pratya\~NgirA with the highly secret
mantra known as the raudra-atharvashiras, the hidden secret crest of
nIlarudra, only passed by the anugraha of shiva to the student. He who
knows this mantra is considered the master of the atharvan lore. His
preceptor then unfolds before him the two supreme chakra-s known as the
mahA-kubjIshAna maNDala, which is more complex in its construction than
even the shrI-chakra, and the mahA-pratya\~NgirA chakra.

Then the preceptor asks him to recite the kubjikA sUkta:  
shanno devI…abhi sravantu naH ||

kubjikA parameShThinI vAgdevI brahma-saMshritA |  
yayaiva sasR^ije ghoraM tayaiva shAntir astu naH ||  
idaM yat parameShThinaM mano vAM brahma-saMshritam |  
yenaiva sasR^ije ghoraM tenaiva shAntir astu naH ||  
imAni yAni pa\~nchendriyAni manaH ShaShThAni me hR^idi brahmaNa
saMshR^itAni |  
yaireva sasR^ije ghoraM taireva shAntir astu naH ||  
aShTAviMshAni shivAni shagmAni saha yogaM bhajantu me |  
yogaM prapadye kShemaM cha kShemaM prapadye yogaM cha namo
.ahorAtrAbhyAm astu ||

Then he goes to the karNamoTa tree, the kula vR^ikSha, and recites the
mAdhavI vidyA to worship kubjikA there in:  
madhuman mUlaM madhumad agramAsAM madhuman madhyaM vIrudhAM babhUva |  
madhumat parNaM madhumat puShpamAsAm madhoH saMbhaktA amR^itaM ghR^itam
annaM duhutAM kubjikAtmakam ||

Then he focuses on his breath and invokes viShNu there in and kubjikA
emerging as the power of his mAyA:  
ajapA vaiShNavI mAyA japyena sAjitA parA |  
kubjikA brahmavidyA sA yA vedair upagIyate ||  
anAkhyeyam idaM guhyaM yogI-kesha-samaM nibham |  
haMsasya gativistAraM bhukti-mukti-phala-pradam ||

Then he perceives his oneness with indra, viShNu, prajApati and the
whole universe and utters:  
tvam indras tvaM mahendras tvaM lokas tvaM prajApatiH |  
tubhyaM yaj\~no vijAyate tubhyaM juhvati juhvatas taved viShNo bahudhA
vIryANi ||  
Then the preceptor gives him the two kUTa-s and decodes them for him:  
prAneshaH sugrIvaH saMvartako vaikuNTho dharA tridhAtur vahnir vyApako
mahAvidyeshvarI saMyutam | This is the kUTa of kubjIshAna.  
sahajaH paramAtmA nR^isiMhaM kAlarudraM khaDgI sha\~NkaraM vahnivarNaM
chAMuNDA tUrya-svara-bhUShitaM nAda-bindu-yutam | This is the kUTa of
mahApratya\~NgirA.

Then he gives him the mantra weapon with which he battles abhichAra:  
chakShuSho hete manaso hete brahmaNo hete tapasash-cha hete ||  
He also gives him the brahmaNa parimara mantra for the same purpose.  
Then he gives him the para-kAya-praveshaNa mantra of the bhR^igu-s:  
taM tvA prapadye taM tvA pravishAmi sarvaguH sarva-puruShaH sarvAtmA
sarva-tanUH saha yanme .asti tena ||  
If appropriately initiated he can even animate a dreadful vetAla with
this mantra.  
Then he gives him the mantra of atharvaNa-bhadra-kAlI:  
kAlI karAlI cha manojavA cha sulohitA yA cha sudhUmravarNA |  
sphuli\~NginI vishvaruchI cha devI lelAyamAnA ||

Then he gives him the pUrNa-dIkSha with all the pratya\~NgirA mantra-s
at pinnacle including the 9-syllabled mantra siddhilakShmI and the deva
nyAsa.

\[While not imparted to brAhmaNa-s today, the final dIkSha in this
series technically is the cremation ground ritual along with the dUtI.
One should impart to the dUtI the secret nyAsa and take a war drum and
go to the shmashAna. There with the crematory fire one makes oblations
to pratya\~NgirA with atharvanic mantra-s. Then facing west he and the
dUtI draw the pratya\~NgirA bhairava-chakra of the 8 special bhairava-s
of this system, with avicephalic and therocephalic forms. In the middle
they install pratya\~NgirA and then enjoying the high rati of maithuna
they invoke the great goddess with her secret mantra with the 4 special
bhakti-s. Then he recites pratya\~NgirA sUkta. With this he becomes the
master of the pratya\~NgirA lore — even if dhUmAvatI or bagalAmukhI were
deployed against him he will back-hurl them.\]
