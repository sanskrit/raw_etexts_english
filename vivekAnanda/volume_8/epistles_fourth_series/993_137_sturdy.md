## CXXXVII

*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

PORT SAID,  
*14th July, 1899*.

MY DEAR STURDY,

I got your letter all right just now. I have one from M. Nobel of Paris
too. Miss Noble has several from America.

M. Nobel writes to me to defer my visit to him at Paris to some other
date, from London, as he will have to be away for a long time. As you
know sure, I shall not have many friends staying now in London, and Miss
MacLeod is so desirous I should come. A stay in England under these
circumstances is not advisable. Moreover, I do not have much life left.
At least I must go on with that supposition. I mean, if anything has to
be done in America, it is high time we bring our scattered influence in
America to a head — if not organise regularly. Then I shall be free to
return to England in a few months and work with a will till I return to
India.

I think you are absolutely wanted to gather up, as it were, the American
work. If you can, therefore, you ought to come over with me. Turiyananda
is with me. Saradananda's brother is going to Boston. . . . In case you
cannot come to America, I ought to go, ought I not?

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.
