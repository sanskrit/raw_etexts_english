READING, ENGLAND,  
*24th Sept., '95.*

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I have not done any visible work as yet except helping Mr. Sturdy in
studying Sanskrit. ... Mr. Sturdy wants me to bring over a monk from
India from amongst my brethren to help him when I am away in America. I
have written to India for one. . . . So far it is all right. I am
waiting for the next wave. "Avoid not and seek not — wait for what the
Lord sends", is my motto. . . . I am a slow writer, but the heart is
full of gratitude. 

Yours with best wishes,

VIVEKANANDA.
