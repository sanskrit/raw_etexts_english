Proto-Indo-European Neb(h) – Moist/Cloudy

This gives us “Nebula”, “Nabhas”, “Nebel”, “Nifl”  
Terms for Clouds, Mists, Waters-Of-The-Skies  
And “Njola” – ‘Night/Darkness’ in Old Norse.

It may also underlie “Neptune” – although  
many argue that “Nepots” \[‘Descendant –  
like Nephew or Nepotism\] is more accurate.

I suspect that it may be *both*: Neb & Nepots  
For Neptune/Poseidon, Ouranos, Varuna –  
These are all forms of the Sky Father.

And we know that for the early Indo-Europeans  
The Sea Is Also Sky, The Sky Is Also Sea  
This understanding being retained  
In various Vedic Hymnals –  
Varuna is Sovereign of the Sea  
And yet is in the Sky, near Celestial Waters

“Neptune” therefore, is Lord of Heavenly Waters  
The Sky Father, myth-remembered, to Lord of Sea.  
And “Nepots”, as Water “Descends” from the Sky  
As Rains into Rivers, and Rivers into the Sea
