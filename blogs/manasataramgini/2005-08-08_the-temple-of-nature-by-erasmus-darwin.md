The grandfather of Charles wrote the following poem, which might be
considered one of the foundational verses of evolutionary biology:

Organic life beneath the shoreless waves  
Was born and nurs’d in ocean’s pearly caves;  
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,  
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;  
These, as successive generations bloom,  
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume;  
Whence countless groups of vegetation spring,  
And breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.

One may compare this with the hymns of gR^itsamada shaunahotra shaunaka
bhArgava:

sa īṃ vṛṣājanayat tāsu garbhaṃ sa īṃ siśurdhayati taṃ rihanti |   
so apāṃ napād-anabhimlātavarṇo .anyasyeveha tanvā viveṣa || 

Of great fertility, he has generated himself as a germ in those
\[waters\]; he is their infant; he sucks the \[waters\]; the \[waters\]
moisten him; apAm napAt of the waters of unfading color has entered here
in a new body.  
**  
yo apsvā sucinā daivyena ṛtāvājasra urviyā vibhāti |   
vayā idanyā bhuvanānyasya pra jāyante vīrudhaśca prajābhiḥ || 

All other beings are, as it were, branches of him, who, truthful,
eternal, and vast, shines amid the waters with pure and divine
(radiance); and the shrubs, with their products, are born (of him).

He who is in waters with his own pure splendour spreads forth widely as
per the eternal law of nature; The various beings of this world have
emerged as descendents of his, the plants with all their descendents
have also descended from him.**
