title = "Kasar Gavlis"

+++
Near Baramati lived a band of Kasar Gavlis, who sold their curds and
milk in brass pots. One day they were visited by viShUchikA. They all
died as a result. The vacuum was filled by a roving band of Maharatta
tribals called the Bhosles. The Bhosles also took to breeding the
gavlisâ€™ cattle and trading milk and curd. They then were called the
Gavlis. The original gavlis worshiped a horned buffalo deity called
mhasobA. The incoming Bhosles too started worshiping mhasobA there
after. Dotting the whole Pune district and its surrounding are buffalo
breeding settlements and associated mhasobA shrines. Also seen are
shrines of vAghobA, khandobA, dhulobA, jyotibA, mhaskobA, birobA and
various AyIs or female deities.
