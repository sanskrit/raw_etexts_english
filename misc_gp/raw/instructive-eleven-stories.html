<p class="Title-Page---Book-Name">Introduction</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Our readers are well acquainted with most revered Shri Jayadayal Goyandka. This book contains eleven instructive stories written by him. Although people who are after  the technique of story-writing may get disappointed (and of  course they are not composed for such people), yet those  householders or strivers who want their upliftment here or hereafter, or who are on  the path to their ultimate object, may find the best possible advice and ideals in this book. I expect everybody to draw benefit from these stories.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">The Safeguard of One’s Best Interests</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Gita 9.22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>‘</span>The devotees, however, who, solely loving Me, constantly think of Me and worship Me in a disinterested spirit, to those ever united in thought with Me, I bring full security and personally attend to their needs.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some people who interpret this verse entirely in a disinterested and detached fashion think it worthwhile only to devote themselves to the remembrance of God taking refuge in Him, to the utter neglect of their mundane existense. In this connection they quote the following parable—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once there was a Brahman who regularly recited the Gita, was a devotee of God and lived the life of detachment. He would spend all his time in reciting the Gita times without number with understanding, practising Jap of the Divine Name and meditating on His Manifest aspect. God was his only refuge. He did not care for his meals, far less to speak of earning his livelihood. His parents had already departed to the other world. He had two brothers. All the three were married. He was the eldest and the other two were younger to him. The two younger brothers afforded to meet the entire household expenses by functioning as family priests. One day the two younger brothers said to the eldest one—‘It would be better if you could find some time for earning your livelihood’. The eldest brother said—‘When God, the sustainer of the universe, who supports one and all, is present at every place and at all times, it is merely childish to be fretful about earning one’s livelihood. The Lord has taken upon Himself the responsibility of safeguarding one’s best interests and needs by proclaiming in verse 22 of chapter IX of the Gita which runs as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So, my brothers, it would be in the fitness of things if we leave ourselves to His will. Right from Brahma upto the lowest forms of creatures as well as the minutest atoms are all supported by Him. Moreover, He is avowed to safeguard the best interests and needs of those who taking refuge in Him constantly reflect on Him. It would be better for us to devote ourselves exclusively to the study and teachings of the Gita and practise only the remembrance of and meditation on God with due reverence and devotion.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The two brothers said—‘Dear brother, you are right indeed but God won’t provide for one sitting idle at home without making efforts to earn one’s bread.’ ‘The Providence can provide for one even if one sits idle at home provided one has reverence for and trust in Him’—replied the eldest one confidently. Both the younger ones got a little irritated and said—‘O brother, it is always easy to talk of lofty ideals. The fact is that the household expenses are met with the little earning we are able to make. You remain lying reciting the holy verses and indulge in lofty talks. You little know what a lot of trouble we have to undertake to make a little earning. You will be able to appreciate the difficulty only when you begin to live apart and run the household yourself. Then shall we see how you manage the affairs’. The eldest one patiently replied—‘Dear brothers, if you deem it proper, I shall not feel any displeasure. Let me live apart. I do not want to be a burden on anyone. God knows best how He is going to provide me.’ At this the two brothers spoke in a decisive tone—‘All right, only tomorrowwe shall make a partition as per our shares.’ ‘You may do as you think proper. I have nothing to demur about. My agreement lies with yours’—said the eldest one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day the two brothers partitioned, whatever property and other belongings they had, into three parts. For his share the Brahman devotee got a mud-built house, a little cash, a few ordinary clothes and ornaments and some cooking utensils etc. One third of the families they visited as priests were also apportioned to him as his share. But such was the mentality of their customers that if some family priest visited their house he was offered something as charity but none cared for the priest who stayed at home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus as per partition the three brothers began to live separately, the Brahman devotee addressed his wife thus—‘Whatever has been apportioned to us by my brothers is quite justifiable but we should henceforth take every care that we resort to God and none else. We should not pay visit to any house in order to ask for something nor should we accept anything even when it is offered to us. God Himself safeguards the best interests and needs of people and it is He who will safeguard ours. For the present we shall manage with whatever has been apportioned to us by my brothers as our share’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman’s wife was a devotee of God and was devoutly faithful to her husband. She accepted her husband’s proposal with due reverence. She thought to herself—‘We have already something to provide us with for the present. When the resources exhaust my husband himself will arrange for things in the way he deems proper.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman devotee would get up at 4 O’clock and go to a tank a mile away from the city and there he would attend the call of nature and wash himself. Then after offering the morning prayers he would offer mental worship, tell the beads, meditate on God and thereafter would recite the whole of the Gita with due devotion concentrating on its meaning and after returning home at eleven would take food and perform other duties. Having taken his food he would again returning to the same tank at 1 O’clock in the noon time, practise Jap, meditation and self-study. Again at 4 p.m. after easing and bathing himself he used to offer the evening prayers. After that having performed mental worship he would reverentially study the holy scriptures. After the sunset he practised the Japof the Divine Nameand meditatedon His aspect. Finally returning home after 8 p.m. he would take his supper and go to bed at 10. At the time of both meals his virtuous wife would take her meals, only after feeding her husband. She considered it her supreme duty to make salutations to her husband daily to offer the best attendance on him, to abide by his bidding and to meditate on God and chant His divine names. Thus the couple pulled on together. Daily expenses had, of course, to be borne by them. After some time the little money they had was spent up. The wife informed her husband that all the money was spent up. The husband enquired of her if the clothings and ornaments too were used up to which the wife gave a negative reply. Now the Brahman’s wife argued to herself that her husband meant to pull on for the present by selling off the clothings and ornaments. So she began to manage the household by disposing of them one by one. But how long could the clothings and the ornaments last. A time came when she had no more of them to dispose of. Then one day his wife informed him that there were no more of ornaments and clothings left in the house. The husband said—‘Worry not. Still we have the utensils and the house as well.’ This made the Brahman’s wife think that her husband consented to manage the household by selling the utensils and the house as well. Without any demur she sold out the house and the two shifted to another rented house. This enabled them to pull on for some time more. Then they sold off the utensils but these could not fetch much money. At last they had nothing left except a ‘saree’ for the Brahman’s wife to wrap herself in and a ‘Dhoti’ and a large napkin for the use of the revered Brahman. One morning at 4 O’clock when the revered Brahman was proceeding to the forest, with folded hands the Brahman’s wife very politely spoke to him thus— ‘My husband, we have nothing left with us now. You are left only with this holy book of yours—the Gita, your Dhoti and the napkin whereas only one saree is left for my use. There is no foodgrain in the house for cooking food this day. Whatever we had, exhausted yesterday.’ The Brahman gave no answer to this and made his way to the forest as usual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the routined manner the Brahman went to the tank and after easing and bathing himself he performed the morning worship and practised the Jap of Gayatri (a divine formula). Subsequently when he was reverently reciting the Gita he came across the following verse which he prized much—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Gita 9.22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That day as the learned Brahman was reciting the verse he thought to himself and argued thus—‘This verse does not seem to containtheutterance of the Lord, probably it is an interpolation. Had it been the utterance of the Lord Himself, would not the Lord ensure my well-being ? I totally depend on Him but to this day He has shown me no favour at all’. Analysing thus he obliterated the verse and barring this one, began to recite the Gita as usual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Noticing such a sentiment of the revered Brahman, the ruler of the hearts of entire creation, ever ready to fulfil the desires of His devotees, at once disguised as a pupil and riding a horse reached the Brahman’s house and approaching his wife and placing before her a large plate filled with sweetmeats asked the whereabouts of the preceptor. The Brahman’s wife said—‘A mile away from home, there is a tank where he goes everyday for performing the daily rituals and returns at about eleven. It is ten now and he is expected to be back in an hour. <span>Who are you and what for have you brought these sweets</span> ?’ <span>‘I am the disciple of the revered Brahman and have</span> brought these sweets to make an offering to my revered preceptor and your goodself, please accept these’, replied the disciple. The Brahman’s wife said—‘The learned Brahman entertains no disciple nor does he accept things offered by others. I have been instructed by him not to accept any offering made by others. So I cannot accept anything offered by others, please take it back.’ The disciple said—‘I quite agree with what you say. True it is that he does not entertain any disciple. He has niether accepted nor will accept anyone as his disciple. But I enjoy his special favour, that is why he has accepted me as a disciple. I want to assure you that I am his only disciple.’ ‘I know full well that he never made any disciple. How then can I take it for granted that you are his disciple. Whatever be the fact, in no circumstance I am going to accept these sweets. You may offer them to the learned Brahman when he returns’— said the Brahman’s wife. ‘Well, I leave this plate right here and the horse also tied nearby. I shall come back again to see the learned Brahman’—said the disciple. At this the Brahman’s wife replied—‘You may take this plate back with you and bring it again when he comes back. In no circumstance shall I keep it without his consent’. But the Lord was no ordinary human being. He walked away leaving the plate at its place. When he was departing the Brahman’s wife said—‘But leave with me your name and address so that on his return the plate containing sweets may be sent back to your house’. The disciple asserted—‘I am known to him and I enjoy his special favour; He has no disciple other than myself. Please tell him that the same disciple of his whom he had disfigured this morning, had come. This will be sufficient to remind him of me.’ Saying so the Lord walked away.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">An hour later when the learned Brahman returned from the forest and entered the house he took notice of the plate full of sweets. A little agitated the Brahman sternly asked— ‘Whence have these sweets come? Who brought them and why have these been accepted?’ With folded hands the Brahman’s wife politely replied—‘My master, I haven’t wilfully accepted them. A disciple presumptuously did so. He said he had brought them as offerings for the preceptor. Even though I did not accept them, he left them here in spite of my resentment.’ The Brahman said—‘You aren’t unaware of the fact that neither have I ever made any disciple nor do I do so on principle’. ‘That’s true indeed. I too did not fail to tell him that neither you have ever made any disciple nor you do so on principle nor will ever make any in future. Taking my statement to be correct he stated that he knew it well that his preceptor did not make any disciple except him. He asserted that he was your only disciple and that you had shown him special favour. That was why you had entertained him as your disciple and assured me that whatever he had stated was true. In spite of all that I only said that I never heard of your accepting him as a disciple. I told him that in no way could I keep that present without your consent still he kept it here and walked away.’ The Brahman remarked—‘At least you should have asked for his whereabouts so that the things belonging to him should be returned to his house’. The Brahman’s wife said—‘I did ask him for it and to my querry he replied that his preceptor knew him. He added that only that morning you had disfigured him and you could not quite dismiss him from your memory so soon. He requested me to tell you that the offering was made by your only disciple whose face was disfigured by you that morning. Saying so he went away and while departing reminded me that the plate containing sweets was being left here, his horse was tied nearby and that he would turn up afterwards to see you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this the Brahman felt horripilation and extremely gladdened he spoke thus—‘O wife, blessed you are for He was none else but God incarnate. You are fortunate to have a perception of Him. I lack in faith and am unfortunate that is why He did not grant me His vision. I did not observe fast even for a day and having lost all patience obliterated the very utterance of the Lord. The Gita has directly emanated from the lips of the Lord and an effort to obliterate it amounts to distorting the face of the Divine Being. Today while reciting the Gita when I came across the verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (<span>I</span>X.22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I felt dubious about the utterance of the Lord and thought that if those were the words of the Lord, He must have looked after my well-being—so this must be an interpolation. Arguing that way I effaced it. I am indeed the vilest sinner lacking in faith. Had I an atom of patience within me, I should never have done such a vile act. The supremely compassionate Lord is already safeguarding our well-being. And He did arrive as soon as we were left penniless. For the offence of disfigurement I was deprived of His perception. You are pure at heart, a devotee of undivided mind and a devoutly faithful wife. So He granted you His perception. No, I shall not enjoy the peace of mind till He turns up’. Later on when he looked out he was surprized to find the horse loaded. He at once unloaded the horse and having carried the bundle inside began to examine it. It was filled with precious stones worth lakhs of rupees. Seeing this the Brahman began to repent for his evil doing. He was again overwhelmed with joy and began to recite rhythmically the following verse from the Bhagawat—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहो वकी यं स्तनकालकूटं जिघांसयापाययदप्यसाध्वी।</p>
<p class="Shlok">लेभे गतिं धात्र्युचितां ततोऽन्यंकंवा दयालुं शरणं व्रजेम॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (3. 2. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(How wonderful it is that the vilest Putana who weaned Krishna with her breast smeared with the deadliest poison in order to put an end to the life of śri Kr̥ṣṇa, merited an end worthy of a good mother (by the grace of the Lord). Why then should we forsaking refuge, in such a compassionate Lord, seek shelter with others).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Fie to me who have stained myself by falsely blaming the Lord who is so affectionate to the poor, the sanctifier of the sinner, the sustainer and the fosterer of all and the Lord of the universe. I am only the minion of pelf. If truly I were the minion of the Lord why should I have catered for fooding and clothing and why should the Lord have to come up with this treasure of precious gems ? Had I the true knowledge of the true aspect and mystries of the Lord, had I true love of Him, had I been rid of the lust for money, why should He delude me by offering these precious stones?’ While saying so the Brahman was overwhelmed with excessive joy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As it was getting very late the Brahman’s wife requested him to take food—the God’s gift. The learned Brahman said that as the Lord had promised, he would partake of it only after His arrival. Evening drew on but the Lord did not turn up. Then the Brahman’s wife requested him to take food— the divine gift. But the learned Brahman was too firm to be shaken from his resolve, he mechanically repeated the reply made earlier. When it was ten in the night—the time to go to bed and the Lord did not turn up, once again the Brahman’s wife requested him to take food—the divine gift. But the revered Brahman would not and so both fell asleep without taking anything at all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was 11 in the night. Knocking at the door someone called out in a very sweet voice—‘O preceptor’s wife, please open the door’. The Brahman couple were still far from getting any sleep at all. Hearing the sweet voice and the endearing address, the Brahman’s wife started up and being overwhelmed with joy said—‘O husband ! see your Lord has come up at last’. The Brahman immediately rushed forward and flung open the door and fell in obeisance at the feet of the Lord. The Lord taking him up into His arms hugged him to His bosom. At that time the Brahman’s condition was too strange to be described. He felt horripilation through the whole of his body, tears rolled down in torrents from his eyes and his voice was choked with excessive joy. Still anyhow he composed himself and spoke—‘O Lord, I have been only a minion of pelf. It is because of your supremely compassionate nature that you have taken pity on a wretched person like me. If my motive and conduct were to be taken into account, I should not even as much get a place in the hell, far less to speak of having your perception. I tried to bring infamy to a blameless and sublime person like You. A person vile like myself full of lust for money would be far to seek. It was for the sake of money that I worshipped You. That is why You offered me these jewels for my satisfaction. I am too much motivated by desires that was why I thought You to be the caretaker of worldly welfare, otherwise I should have craved for my spiritual well-being. Those who with a desireless heart surrender themselves to You alone, do not even aspire for this spiritual well-being, but notwithstanding that, You safeguard their best interests and needs. I was too unfortunate to be devoid of such reverence, love, faith and self-surrender to make exclusive self-surrender to Supreme Being like You.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> The Lord said—‘You are not to blame in this matter. You had surrendered yourself exclusively to Me. The delay in My arrival was caused on account of My faulty nature. <span>But how is it that you haven’t taken your meal till now</span> ?’ <span>The learned Brahman replied</span>—‘When you had left the word that you would turn up to see me, how could I take food prior to your arrival ? Be pleased to take food first, we too, shall partake of the remainder afterwards.’ ‘Nay, we all shall dine together’—said the Lord. Then the Brahman’s wife getting a hint from the Lord, offered food to both of them. The revered Brahman overwhelmed with love took his share of food. Having dined the Lord spoke—‘Ask for whatever you desire, nothing is unattainable by you.’ The Brahman said—‘When You have arrived here <span>in person,</span> <span>does </span><span>anything</span><span> remain to be </span><span>aspired</span><span> for even now</span> ? My Lord, my only desire is that my heart should be rid of even the desire for my spiritual well-being and that I should have true and exclusive loveof You.’ Saying—‘Be it so’ the Lord disappeared. Subsequently the Brahman’s wife also took her share of food.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the other side such was the state of affairs that since the time the two younger brothers had sought separation from the eldest one, they became unhappy and grew miserably poorer and poorer. Such was their plight that they did not get anything even by borrowing or begging. When the news came to their ears that their brother had become so rich that his doors were always crowded with beggars, they also approached their brother. Seeing that his brothers had arrived, the learned Brahman who was a great devotee embraced them and enquired after their welfare. In reply they said—‘How could we ever afford to be happy after being separated from a gentleman like you ? We dare not show our faces to you. It is kind of you to take pity on us and entertain us with love.’ The eldest one said—‘No, brother, do not talk like that. The three of us are real brothers born of the same womb. The fact is that we can never be separated. It was merely an unavoidable event. We should live cordially together as ever before. Who could be more affectionate well-wisher in this world other than one’s real brother? Instead of being ashamed and repentant you should try to live with accord as before. My brothers, the credit of amassing this wealth you are beholding, does not accrue to me. All this is the glory of the Lord. The Lord by all means safeguards the well-being of each and everyone who takes refuge in Him alone. Just as a child confiding himself to the care of his parents moves about fearlessly and the parents naturally have to provide with all his needs in the same way, nay, even in a better way the Lord undertakes the work of upbringing and safeguarding those dependent on Him. He goes beyond that and even surrenders himself to Him. So having full faith in whatever has been said in this verse (quoted below) you should meditate on God alone and devote yourselves to the study and teaching of the Gita regularly trying to understand its connotative and denotative meaning—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जना: पर्युपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (9. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Since then, the two brothers began to stay with their eldest brother and under his advice began to practise Jap, meditation and the recitation of the Gita in a routined way and within a short time through the adoration of God, attained God-realization by the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How far this story is true is not known, but from this story we must draw the moral that after taking refuge in God, He safeguards one’s best interests and needs. So placing full reliance on this fact, we too, should try to surrender ourselves to God. The best thing is to meditate on God with a desireless mind regularly and at all times. One should try to develop disinterested and true love of God without aspiring for one’s spiritual well-being. But if one ever aspires for one’s well-being one should aspire for true spiritual well-being. The realization of what remains unrealized is termed as ‘Yoga’ and the safeguard of what has already been achieved is termed as ‘Kshema’. What is meant by the term ‘Spiritual well-being’ is that God safeguards what has already been achieved in the field of spiritual practice and contributes to what remains unachieved <span>in one’s effort towards God-realization. Such is the a</span>ssurance given by the Lord. Knowing this and placing one’s full trust in it one should surrender oneself to God and rid oneself of all fears and should not contemplate over anything except the contemplation of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Those who worship God for the purpose of material well-being and the safeguard of worldly interests are decidedly superior to those who do not adore God; for the seekers of worldly objects and the sufferers have been described by Him as noble and virtuous—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘उदारा: सर्व एवैते’ </span>(Gita 7.18). ‘All these are noble devotees’ but the man of wisdom and the devotee of undivided mind and disinterested spirit has verily been described by Him as His ownself because the man of wisdom having a desireless mind, has God alone as his ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So it is desirable for us to become disinterested and enlightened devotees of undivided mind, for such a devotee is extremely dear to the Lord. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां ज्ञानी नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रियो हि ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Gita 7. 17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Of these the best is the man of wisdom, constantly established in identity with Me and possessed of exclusive devotion. For, extremely dear I am to the wise man and he is extremely dear to Me.<span></span></p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="char-style-override-8">(Implication of a verse of the Gita)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A Brahman, poor though he was, was fully contented, virtuous and learned. His wife who was very faithfully devoted to her husband was learned, possessed of knowledge inessence and was liberated in her mundane existence. The ruler of that country was also possessed of knowledge in essence and was an exalted soul free from his mundane existence. The Brahman’s wife one day thought to herself that her revered husband was endowed with contentment, virtues and learning and as such he was undoubtedly worthy of attaining salvation. But if he came in contact with the king, he too could be possessed of knowledge in essence and be liberated in his mundane existence. Arguing to herself in that way she requested her husband thus—‘O revered husband, we are passing through great straits these days, it is difficult for us to make both ends meet and we have no source of income. People say that the ruler of this country is very saintly and a great soul liberated in his mundane existence and he greets and entertains the Brahmans in a respectful manner and is very generous. If you could meet him but once he would, possibly, entertain you in a befitting manner and needless it is to remind you that according to the scriptural ordinances whatever the king offers without asking is nectarean to a Brahman.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The learned Brahman said—“That’s right but I think it undesirable on my part to accept gratuity from anyone for my subsistence, even if it is had without asking, unless I earn his gratitude by doing him some good. So, I will refrain from doing that even though I am starved to death.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You are a learned man and you can earn the king’s gratitude by exhorting him in a befitting manner’, said the Brahman’s wife.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This suggestion appealed to the learned Brahman a little but he did not feel inspired to approach the king. At last, on repeated requests from his wife the Brahman gave in and reached the king’s court. The learned Brahman was well known throughout the kingdom for his good qualities and virtuous conduct. The king greeted the learned Brahman warmly. After making enquiries about his welfare, the king sent for a large number of gold coins and presented them to the learned Brahman. Refusing to accept them the learned Brahman said—‘O king, I know you are very generous but I have made it a rule not to accept money from anyone, even if it is offered without asking, unless I earn his gratitude by doing him some good. If you entrust me some work and if I am able to do it to your satisfaction, in that case whatever you offer will be accepted by me. The king said—‘Very well, you are a virtuous and scholarly Brahman. I would like to listen from you the real meaning of the Gita. Be pleased to explain to me clearly the meaning as well as the purport of the sixteenth verse of chapter XII of the Gita.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At first the learned Brahman recited the verse and then went on to explain it—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनपेक्ष: शुचिर्दक्ष उदासीनो गतव्यथ:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वारम्भपरित्यागी यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who craves for nothing, who is both internally and externally pure, is clever and impartial and has risen against all distractions, who renounces the feeling of doership in all undertakings—that devotee is dear to Me.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After that he proceeded to give a detailed explanation of the verse as follows— He who does not entertain even the least desire, craving or hidden bias for anything, who is satiated and has absolutely no concern with any object is spoken of as ‘Anapeksha’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He whose inner senses are absolutely pure, whose external behaviours are pure, impartial and free from all agitations, whose very sight, touch, speech and conversation lend purity to others, is spoken of as truly pure—‘Shuchi’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The accomplishing of the object for which human body has been vouchsafed to us, i.e., the realization of God is man’s true cleverness. He who realizes his object is called clever (Daksha).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who while giving evidence in a court of law or while acting as an arbitrator does not show any favour out of regard for a kinsman, relative or friend—always remains unbiased, is spoken of as impartial (Udasin).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He whose mind does not give way to any grief or cause of grief in other words who is not grieved at heart by any anxiety, sorrow or grief, is spoken of as unperturbed (Gatavyathah).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who does nothing at all of his own accord but becomes only a puppet in the hands of ‘Prarabdha’ does nothing at all with a selfish motive, is contented with whatever he gets, who has given up the feeling of doership in all activities impulsed by ‘Prarabdha’, untainted internally or externally by egoism, is spoken of as ‘Sarvarambha-parityagi’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the learned Brahman had concluded the above detailed explanation the king modestly said to the Brahman—learned sir, you have given a good explanation. Your comments are based on sound arguments and supported by the scriptures, still I have reason to believe that in spite of giving such a beautiful explanation of the verse, you are unaware of its practical aspect. The learned Brahman spoke—‘Had I not been aware of its secret meaning how could I have explained it so elaborately. I have learnt by rote all the fifty two commentaries on the Gita. Still if you are aware of any further secret meaning you are requested to explain it yourself.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Instead of saying anything in reply the king very modestly said—‘O learned Brahman, I am quite satisfied with the beautiful explanation, based on the scriptures, that you have given. I am greatly obliged to you. So please accept the presents I have offered you.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The learned Brahman said—‘O king, there is actually no cause for satisfaction when you say that I am unaware of the secret meaning. The satisfaction is only verbal. So long as you aren’t truly satisfied I do not intend to accept anything, whatsoever, from you.’ In spite of repeated requests from the king the learned Brahman returned home without accepting the present. On the other side the king called for a trusted spy and said—‘The revered Brahman is very selfless, virtuous and self-respecting scholar. You follow him in his foot step and find out how he behaves at his house and what sort of conversation takes place there and then inform me about it.’ At the order of the king the spy followed him and marked the behaviour and conversation of all the members of his family.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On returning home being asked by his wife the learned Brahman told her the detailed account of the happenings at the court. The wife modestly and lovingly said—‘O husband, whatever the king has said seems to be proper. You shouldn’t have taken ill of it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: (displaying a little anger and agitation). O! You too are supporting the king’s statement.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: It is you who often say that a just cause must be supported.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: (a little more agitatedly in order to prevail on her at once). Is the king’s statement justifiable when he says that my explanation is beautiful but I do not know its secret meaning?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Please excuse me. The king’s observations are quite correct for it is easy to explain a verse but it is very difficult to know its true and hidden meaning.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: How is it so?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: In the same way as the gramophone record, which is set on the machine, plays the music but is unable to know its secrets.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: Do you mean to compare me to a gramophone ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: What difference could there be between the gramophone and the man who commends and exhorts others in a beautiful manner but does not live upto his own ideals ? Do you live upto the ideals you talked of, while explaining the verse to the king ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: Why not? Where do you find me lacking ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife:  Please listen to my humble submission unagitatedly. Pray, explain again to me each word of the verse. What do you understand by the term ‘Anapeksha’ ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: He, who does not entertain any desire, craving or bias for anything and has no concern with anything, is unconcerned (Anapeksha).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Is this term truly applicable to you ? </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: Why not? I entertain no desire, craving or bias for anything whatsoever. It was on your insistence that I went to the king and in spite of repeated requests from the king I did not accept anything from him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Very well, I take it as true that you went there on my insistence. It is your favour on me, I suppose. But tell me what does the term ‘Shuchi’ imply?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: He whose inner senses are quite pure, whose external behaviour is also pure, impartial and free from agitation, whose sight, speech, touch and conversation  purify even others, is spoken of as ‘Shuchi’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife:<span>Are you internally and externally pure like that</span> ? Do people get purified by your sight, touch, speech and conversation? Are your inner senses free from all taints? Is your external behaviour free from agitation, pure and unbiased? If it is so how did the feeling of anger and agitation arise in your mind and why did you utter words expressive of your ego to the king ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: (Perplexed) well, I admit I lack that quality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Now, how did you explain the word ‘Daksha’ (clever) ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: The realization of the object for which human form has been vouchsafed to man i.e., realization of God is the true cleverness of man. He who achieves his object only he is said to be clever (Daksha).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Is it then that you have realized the great object for which you came to this world ? Have you achieved the Supreme Abode ? If not, there is hardly anything to demur at the king’s observation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: You are right. I am lacking in this respect also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: What do you mean by the term ‘Udasin’?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: He who, while giving evidence in the court, sitting in judgment or working in the capacity of an arbitrator, makes no allowance for the members of his family, friend or kinsman out of attachment, malice, greed, infatuation or fear and remains unbiased and impartial in each and every circumstance, is spoken of as unconcerned (Udasin).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Then, are you impartial? Did you not plead your own points before the king ? Did you think seriously over the king’s observation that you did not know the secret meaning of the verse ? If not, why is the king’s observation not valid ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: (Confessing his own drawback with a pure and upright mind) You are right to tell the truth. You have opened my eyes today. I very much lack the quality of being impartial. Often in debates, I do not desist from pleading my own standpoint too far in spite of knowing that my arguments hold no water.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: And what does the term ‘Gatavyathah’ imply ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: He who does not grieve even when confronted with the greatest sorrow or even at the presentation of a cause of sorrow, whose inner senses do not give way to any grief, anxiety or sorrow is spoken of as ‘Gatavyathah’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Don’t you grieve at heart for anything at all ? If you do not, why were you so much agitated and grieved at the king’s remarks and subsequently on my supporting the king’s statement ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: You are right indeed, I do not possess this quality in the least. When things go against my expectations, I not only feel grieved at every step but fear, agitation, envy, sorrow and such other evils make their way into my mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: How do you interpret the term ‘Sarvarambhaparityagi’ ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: One who has given up all activities internal or external impulsed by desire and does only that which is impulsed by Prarabdha and does nothing with a selfish motive, who is satiated with whatever he gets unasked, who has renounced the feeling of doership in all actions impulsed by Prarabdha—such a renouncer of actions, internal or external, is spoken of as ‘Sarvarambhaparityagi’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: An excellent exposition indeed! But tell me whether you have renounced all actions, internal or external. Do your inner senses not entertain any worldly desire ? If not, why should you nurse so much of ego, notwithstanding that you are performing all actions only externally ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: True it is that I am totally devoid of this quality. All my shortcomings have been brought home to me. It is true that I revelled only in giving literal explanations and remained unaware of its secret import. Now the true meaning is being revealed to me gradually. Now I intend to become a recluse renouncing all— internally and externally, so please give your consent to my resolve—saying this the learned Brahman, renouncing all, finally resolved to proceed from his house on his spiritual quest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: (Imploringly) I, too, want to follow suit and accompany you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman: I do not want to keep any sort of botheration for me, far less to speak of allowing a woman to stay with me.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wife: Please do not consider me to be a burden on you. I shall put no hindrance in your spiritual practice. My intention, in sending you to the king today, was surely not of procuring money. I made money only a means to an end. My only intention was that you should attain the principal object of life. The king is verily possessed of the knowledge of Truth, and is a great soul liberated in his mundane existence. You too are the knower of duties, virtuous, a renouncer of actions, contented and learned as well. By virtue of your contact and association with the kingwho is possessed of the knowledge of Truth you will certainly be able even to attain God-realization. Such was my intention in sending you to the king. Now if you are pleased to allow me, I would like to accompany you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brahman<span>—</span>(expressing his gratitude) Now I stand correct. Your presence will not be of any disadvantage to me. You alone are a true benefactor and friend to me. In fact the truest friends are they who help their kinsmen attain God-realization. Come along, there too you will rather be helpful to me in God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thereafter the couple renouncing all, went out of their house never to return. Thither the king’s spy, who had heard their conversation and witnessed the occurrences, went to the king and precisely reported to him the whole affair. The king who had already handed over the charge of the state and the royal treasury etc., to the prince, after receiving the report of the spy and renouncing his state, started from there. On the way he came across the Brahman couple coming towards him from the opposite direction. The king joyfully exclaimed, ‘O revered Brahman, now, I see, you have understood the secret meaning of the verse of the Gita.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The learned Brahman modestly replied—‘I haven’t understood it yet, but am fairly on my way to understand it.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Theking too, accompanied them. Then the three retiring to a solitary and sacred place settled down there. The king and the Brahman’s wife were verily great souls, and possessed the knowledge of Truth and were liberated in their mundane existence. By virtue of his association with them the learned Brahman also succeeded in attaining God-realization.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Disinterestedness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Both Ramu and Gopal were the inhabitants of the same village. Both of them were Kahar by caste. Gopal did the work of scouring utensils and sweeping etc., at the house of the Peshkar (reader) to the chief Divan of the king of Ichchhanagari. Gopal was elder to Ramu and was related to him as cousin. Ramu’s father was a man who was looked upon with respect by the village-people. Though Ramu was born in a Kahar family, he was sharp-witted and the noble qualities were inherently predominant in him. The qualities of head and heart such as adoration of God, humility, contentment and disinterestedness etc., had also developed in him. Besides he wore a princely beauty on his face. All the people of the village loved him. Even at the early age of fifteen, besides good learning he had acquired a number of virtues from Pandit Rama Kant, a virtuous, elderly and scholarly person, who was devoted to God and exercised self-control and who after giving up the high post of teachership in the city had voluntarily and in a selfless spirit taken upon himself the task of educating the children of the village.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rampura, the village where Ramu lived, was not far from the capital of Ichchhanagari. One day early in the morning, after taking bath he left his home and reached Ichchhanagari by the day-dawn. After making a long search he found out Gopal’s house and soon after getting there suddenlyclasped his feet by hands. Gopal had left his bed just then. He was astonished to find Ramu so unexpectedly and began to look into his face with the mingled feeling of joy and surprize. ‘Brother, how fortunate you are!’ said Ramu holding his feet by the hand. ‘O brother, it’s good indeed that you have come here. Is it all well at the village ? Brother though you are, why is it that you are holding my feet by the hand’—said Gopal at one breath, drawing himself aback.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Brother, I have no words to describe your greatness. But you are fortunate indeed’—added Ramu very delightfully.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Brother, I am a member of your own family as you own me. But look at my work, I am simply a menial servant who scours utensils at the house of the Peshkar to the Divan of the king. How can a man like me be fortunate?’ asked Gopal with curiosity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Well, this is the reason why you are fortunate. You know our king is a great man. He is a devotee of undivided mind, a man of wisdom and an exalted soul having communion with God’—said Ramu still clinging to the feet of Gopal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘But that makes little difference. These qualities are possessed by the king and not by me. I am devoid of all the virtues’—said Gopal trying to free his legs from his grab.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In words soaked in endearment and regard Ramu said— ‘Is it not an exceptional thing to get an employment at the house of the Peshkar to the Divan of the king who is such a liberated soul. I should regard it an achievement of my life if I am fortunate enough to get such a job, rather I should be fortunate if I get a chance even to serve you’—saying this he began to look into his face.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Gopal was greatly impressed with Ramu’s words. He said— ‘Brother, the Peshkar is already in need of a man—he was telling me so. Since you have come all the way and want some job, I shall arrange for one this day.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ramu began to work at the house of the Peshkar with due dedication. On the completion of one month when he refused to accept money sent to him through Gopal, the Peshkar called him to his presence and said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">You work round the clock with great vigour, reverence, love and devotion. You do twice as much work as was done by the previous servant. No other servant does so much of work, still you did not ask for any wages last month; to me it is very humiliating, indeed. I think ten rupees a month is quite a meagre amount. So, now I would like to fix your monthly wages a little higher at your will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ramu’s joy knew no bounds. After all he had been fortunate enough to stay with the Peshkar to the Divan of the king, possessing a number of pious, noble and divine qualities. That is why, giving up egoism, infatuation, lust and selfishness with a heart full of great reverence and devotion, he was rendering his duties disinterestedly. The Peshkar was indeed greatly satisfied with his work. Hearing the words of the Peshkar, very meekly he replied—‘Surely enough the cause of my refusal was not that the wages were meagre.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Peshkar was astonished to hear this. He could not, for a time, believe Ramu’s words. He asked—‘Why is it then that you put in so much of labour ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is well known to you that the king is a man of great sublimity. He is a Yogi, a man of wisdom, a devoted and a great soul as well. You are the Peshkar to the Divan. It is a matter of pride for me that I have got this opportunity of serving you. Can wages be any way better than this?’ replied Ramu bowing his head.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The king is indeed much the same as you have described, but as for me, I am only a common man. I lack all the qualities with which he is endowed. What benefit do you derive by serving me?’ asked the Peshkar eagerly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘After all you are the Peshkar of his Divan. Am I not lucky enough to get an opportunity to serve great men like you. Far less to speak of God’s service, it is a matter of great luck even to avail the opportunity of serving the servants, of His servants, nay, even the servants of those servants because with their association sometimes one may have the auspicious perception of the great men—having extreme devotion to God. In the same way by serving you I may sometimes have the auspicious sight of Divanji who lives in close contact with the king who is devoted to God’—said Ramu straightforwardly what was at his heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It’s not rare to have a look at the Divan, I can make you have a look at him only tomorrow’—the Peshkar was enchanted by the pious sentiments of Ramu. He said—‘The Divan comes to the court at eight in the morning and I also reach there by that time. You should come there at about nine with a glass of tea as well as some water. And as for your wages, I want to remit to your house any amount you desire’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I need no money. The household expenditure is already managed. I should be satisfied by having a look at Divanji.’ Ramu evaded accepting money on one or the other polite pretexts. The Peshkar was gazing at Ramu. His heart was full of praise for his good disposition.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seated on a cushioned plank and reclining on a bolster the Divan cast a look at the door. A handsome unfamiliar young man with a glass in his hand was looking at him with unwinking eyes as if he were spell-bound, as if someone were having a perception of God himself. The Divan looked at him time and again but found him unwinking. With unsatiable eyes he was only looking at the Divan.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Who is this man and why is he standing there?’—the Divan asked the Peshkar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Sir, he is your humble servant. I couldn’t take tea before coming here, so he has brought it here’—replied the Peshkar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Then take your tea first’—said the Divan.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Peshkar took tea and busied himself with his work. But the Divan was already enamoured of extremely yearning and attractively endearing looks of Ramu. He could not help himself cast a glance at Ramu. Having cleaned and washed the pots of tea, Ramu swept the place. Then he applied himself to rubbing off the shoes of the Divan. Nevertheless he stole a look, inspired with deep love and reverence, at Divanji.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Unasked this lad does all his duties with love and zeal and that too, so swiftly and efficiently. How much do you pay him ?’—the Divan enquired of the Peshkar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Sir....he does a lot of work and that too, very efficiently but accepts nothing for his services’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Taken aback he called Ramu to him and asked—‘Will you tell me why you go on working so cheerfully without charging anything ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Simply for the sake of your vision, sir. My luck has favoured me only today’, said Ramu in a suppressed tone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘What is there special in me ?’ being tempted the Divan asked Ramu.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Divanji, you already know that our king is a profoundly great man. He is a Yogi, a man of wisdom, a devotee and a free soul as well. You are the Divan of so pious a king. To have your perception is no trifling thing. Only very fortunate people get the opportunity of having your perception’, said Ramu affectionately and meekly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘If you have such sentiments for me, you would better stay with me.’ The Divan was now under the spell of love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ramu was taken aback. Very delightfully he said—‘I shall regard myself very fortunate by getting a chance to live at your revered feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Well, I want to keep this man in my service’, said the Divan turning to the Peshkar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You may gladly do so’—consented the Peshkar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You have served me for a long time. Usually, no servant does his duties with such dedication and zeal as you have been doing. But you did not accept any wages till now and this pricks my conscience too much. If not as wages, you must accept something as reward. I can arrange to send to your house at least two to four hundred rupees or whatever amount you desire’—said the Divan very affectionately.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The members of my family are in a position to manage the household, sir. I hardly need any money’—replied Ramu like a devotee full of reverence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘If you don’t want to send money you may send any other thing which you like. I am much obliged to you for your services, I want to do something in return’—insisted Divanji.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Don’t put me to shame by saying so. The service that I render to you, is my greatest reward because you are Divan to a great man and a great servant of the country. For me even your perception was hard to achieve. By providing me an opportunity to serve your goodself, you have earned my gratitude for ever. If my fortune favours, I may probably get a chance to have the perception of the king while I am under your service’—Ramu opened out his heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘As far the perception of the king is concerned, I can manage for the same only tomorrow. I reach there at eleven and the king arrives there at one. On Tuesdays I keep fast and tomorrow is the day of my fasting. You know, I go there without taking anything and fruits are sent to me there. You may come there with my meal of fruits. But mind, you have to consent to send some money to your house’—insisted the Divan.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I am ever indebted to you, sir, I do not want money.’ Ramu bowed down his head in gratitude.</p>
<p class="Uwach"> ***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king’s eyes fell on Ramu who was immersed in an ocean of joy. He noticed the peculiar joy he was in. With unwinking eyes he was looking at the king and was rejoicing. The king was by no means unaware of this, so he asked the Divan who he was and why he was standing there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Sir, he is one of your humble servants. As it is Tuesday today he has brought fruit for my meal’—said the Divan. ‘Then you must take your meal consisting of fruits first’, ordered the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Divan took his meal consisting of fruits at a separate place and after returning from there resumed his work. After cleaning the defiled pots, Ramu set himself to the task of cleaning the shoes of the Divan and the king. Meanwhile, stealing a look at the king at intervals, he was getting enwrapped in a rapturous state. He was rather spell-bound. The king too did not fail to take notice of the state of mind he was in.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘This lad seems to be very active. How much is he paid for his wages ?’—The king enquired of the Divan.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Your majesty, he does his work with great application actuated by love but does not accept any wages’, replied the Divan.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king was much surprized. He called Ramu to his presence and asked—‘How is it that you work so cheerfully and so zealously without taking any wages?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Your majesty, how do you say that? It was by his (Divan’s) grace that I am rendered extremely gratified by having the perception of a supremely great man like you. I am fortunate indeed that I have been blessed with the perception of an esteemed personality like you.’ Ramu was extremely delighted.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘What makes you feel that you have achieved the highest goal of your life ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Your goodness is a great man. The perception of a Yogi, a man of wisdom, a devotee and a high souled person like you, is very rare and is availed of by very fortunate men alone. By having the perception of your lordship I am profoundly gratified. My life’s purpose has been achieved today. By your majesty’s grace I have attained blessedness today’, said Ramu clasping the king’s feet by his hand.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘If you so desire you may stay with me for ever.’ The king was already impressed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It is a matter of great pleasure for me. There can be nothing better to be aspired for by me.’ Ramu bowed down at the feet of the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Let this lad remain with me’, the king said to the Divan. Affection welled up in his heart. The Divan nodded his head in submission.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I am quite satisfied with your services but neither you accept money nor arrange to send any thing to your house. Tell me what you desire. I want to see your desire fulfilled’—said the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘When your majesty is satisfied with this minion, nothing remains unachieved by me. I need no money at all’—said Ramu in reply.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I am thankful to you. You will have to accept something for my satisfaction’—the king insisted again.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Please do not put me to shame by saying that. All physical possessions seem to me to be quite insignificant in comparison with the service of your honour. I require <span>nothing more. In spite of this if you insist on, you will</span> have to grant me whatever I desire for’—said Ramu in a sweet tone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You shall certainly get whatever you desire’. The king had resolved to offer the whole of his territory if he desired so.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I wish I should stay with you for ever. Your majesty should not separate me from you, even for a moment’. Ramu lay prostrate at the feet of the king with his heart full of exceeding reverence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It is hardly a thing to be asked for. You already stay with me for a very long time. You should demand something else.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘But, I desire this much, nothing more.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I have no objection. You are at liberty to stay with me.’</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘In the bedroom behind me in the night. How is it ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Your majesty has permitted me to stay with you all the time’—at once replied Ramu with folded hands.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Come along’—said the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king then said to the queen—‘You had no son so I have brought him here to serve you as your son.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Verywell’, saidthe queen and cast a glance at Ramu’s face. Seeing his charming face a tear drop of love trickled down from her eyes. Sentiments of affection rose up in her heart. Ramu also looked spell bound at the queen’s face as if he were her own child.</p>
<p class="Uwach">    ***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>‘So far, I have been looking after those affairs but</span> now onwards all the papers will be signed by him and his signature shall be deemed as good as mine’, the king said to the Divan for he was quite satisfied with Ramu’s spirit of service. Ramu was not only sharp-witted but also served the king with devotedness and was ready to imbibe in himself his virtues spontaneously. So within a short period of time he had acquired profound capabilities. Of course, he was not deprived of the advantages of education.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Divan received the royal mandate with due deference and in pursuance of the order, the papers were now being signed by Ramu.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some time passed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I have no issue. I want to instal you as the crown prince’, the king said to Ramu. Now the king had begun to look upon him with paternal love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Your majesty should not put me to shame. I cannot cease serving you. The kingship is far inferior to the great benefit I am deriving’, replied Ramu like a son devoted to his parents.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king accepted the suggestion made by him and made him manage the affairs of the state under his directions.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I am only a humble servant of yours and whatever I have attained, has been attained by me through your grace’, said Ramu enfolding the Divan’s feet with his hands.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘No, no, you are the representative of the king. You are the future successor to the throne. Do not put me to shame by acting this way’. The perplexed Divan any how succeeded in making Ramu sit on the throne. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Peshkar had come to the court in connection with some work. ‘I am only to serve your revered feet as a slave. All this could be achieved by me through your grace’, said Ramu holding the Peshkar’s feet in his hands and with a view to make the Peshkar sit on the throne began to drag him towards himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The helpless Peshkar had come up there on some purpose. With a great difficulty making Ramu sit on the throne, he returned to his own seat.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He got down from the throne and rushed to the old servant of the Peshkar who happened to be there and said, ‘It is due to your grace that I could get this throne, come and occupy this.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I cannot dare sit on the throne in the presence of the Divan and the Peshkar. Please do not put me to shame’, saying this the servant sank to the ground. He had come up there on some business. Ramu was not the least tainted by pride.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">You are the very image of modesty. You are not the least affected by conceit and lust. From the lowest employee to the highest officials—all are very much happy with you. You seem to possess an unparalleled capability of holding the reins of administration. So you should act upon my advice and accept kingship. Now I want to retire into seclusion. The king put forth this proposal before Ramu.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Your majesty has already granted me the boon of always and at all times remaining at your revered feet, how then would you be able to separate me from you even for a while ? I cherish no desire for the crown. Do not put me to shame by saying all this. I cannot remain aloof from you even for a while. I cannot afford to accept the kingship and for this act of mine I would like to tender my heartiest apology to you’, Ramu conveyed his decision to the king in words full of modesty, love and firmness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Then consent to accept the crown while staying with me’—the king had no alternative, except to revise his decision.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now Ramu, staying with the king, began to look after the affairs of the state.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This fabulous story, relating to Ramu Kahar, has been quoted here as a parable. It should be interpreted in the following manner with regard to esoteric knowledge. The Sadhaka proceeding along the path of God-realization is represented here by Ramu Kahar. Gopal the servant of the Peshkar should be considered to represent the servant, nay, the servant of His servant’s servant. The Peshkar should be taken to represent the servant of God’s servants and the king of Ichchhanagari should be taken to represent God himself. Devotion, knowledge and Yoga etc., the virtuous qualities of the king should be taken to represent the divine attributes and His glory. The wife of the king i.e., the queen should be taken to represent the goddess incarnate, symbolizing the Divine Power. The refusal to accept anything such as wages and even kingship, should be taken to represent renunciation of selfishness—consistent with disinterestedness, and his reverence, dedication and his polite treatment should be taken to be the ideal decorum. The kingship is symbolic of salvation and staying all the time with the king, should be considered to be the token of the intensely true love of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">From this parable we should infer the precept that after giving up egotism, lust, infatuation and selfishness, and having association with servants of God’s servants and rendering them the best of our services in a disinterested spirit, we should act upon the behests of the Lord with reverence, devotion and humility and even without cherishing the desire for deliverance, living in communion with God with a disinterested love for Him and ceaselessly meditating on Him, we should lay emphasis on rendering service.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Invaluable is the Divine Name</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While describing the glory of the Divine Name in his work ‘The Ramacharit Manas’, Goswami Tulasidas goes to the extent of declaring that in Kali Yuga the divine names are the only means to salvation. The vilest sinners like Ganika and Ajamil, attained liberation through the glory of the Divine Name. Shri Hanuman subordinated Lord Shri Ram to himself through the glory of the Name. Simply by placing this name at the tip of the tongue, there is a radiant light within and without. So great is the glory of the Name that even the Lord Himself is unable to describe it. <span class="char-style-override-9">‘</span><span class="char-style-override-9">राम न सक</span><span class="char-style-override-9">हिं</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> नाम गुन गाई</span><span class="char-style-override-9">’</span> (Lord Ram Himself cannot adequately describe the glory of the Name). Through the power of this very Name, Lord Shiv grants deliverance to every creature at Kashi. The Shrimad Bhagawat, the Mahabharat and other scriptures as well, are replete with allusions describing the glory of the Name. But why is it that concrete results of the Divine Name, as has been <span>described in those books</span>, is not experienced in actual life ?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Many gentlemen raise doubt by putting forward such arguments. A valid answer to the questions raised as to why concrete results are not visible, is the lack of reverence in the Name itself. The truth is that the Divine Name is more glorious than its description in the scriptures. Infinite is the glory of the Name. The description of the glory in the scriptures are simply the outpourings of great souls who were actually benefitted by the Name. Just as glory of God as well as the association with the noble souls transcends all description, in the same way the glory of the Name beggars all description and the truth is that our lack of faith and reverence in the Divine Name is the consequence of our ignorance about reality, secret, virtues and glory etc., of the Divine Name. Sometimes it is for the lack of reverence at all, on the other hand that men are deprived of its true benefit. Infinite is the glory of the Name indeed. No earthly possession can stand a match for the Divine Name. To make an effort to compare the Divine Name with the insensate and transitory objects of the world is nothing but the display of one’s own ignorance.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">A Parable on the Glory of the Divine Name</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a devotee of a very high order and a great soul devoted to Divine Name. One of his disciples also stayed with him. Once when the high-souled man had gone out somewhere, a man came to his cottage and enquired where the Mahatma was. The disciple told him that the Mahatma had gone out on some business and requested to tell him his purpose. The stranger said, ‘How could my son who is seriously ill, possibly be restored to health? In the absence of the Mahatma could you please suggest some device ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The disciple replied—‘Of course there is a very easy device. Please write down the name ‘Ram’ three times and pouring water on the writing make him drink the water thus poured. He will be restored to health simply through this ‘device.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The stranger went home. The next day in a very cheerful mood the man came to the cottage of the Mahatma. The Mahatma was present there at the time. Falling prostrate at his feet, with folded hands and in all humility he said—‘O Mahatma, your disciple seems to be an accomplished man. I came here only yesterday. You had gone out to some place. Only this disciple of yours was present. Since you were absent I asked him to tell me some device of curing the illness of my son. At my request he suggested me to write the name ‘Ram’ three times and after pouring water over it make my son drink the water thus poured. After reaching home I acted upon his advice and it is a matter of great surprise and pleasure that by using this device he at once left the bed as if he had no illness at all.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this the Mahatma became angry with the disciple and pretending to be angry in the interest of the disciple said—‘O fool, for such an ordinary illness you made him use the name ‘Ram’ three times. You are quite ignorant about the glory of the Divine Name. Even by pronouncing the name once, recurring innumerable sins are burnt and he is freed from bondage of birth and death. The man also attains the Supreme State. You do not deserve to stay in the hermitage. So you may go wherever you like.’ This brought tears in the eyes of the disciple and he implored his preceptor again and again for forgiveness. The saints are definitely soft like butter from within and outwardly also he softened and pardoned his fault.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the Mahatma took out, from somewhere, a beautiful and brightly shining stone and placing it in the hand of the disciple said—‘Go to the town and find out how much price can it fetch. Beware ! you haven’t to sell it for any price whatsoever. You have only to get its price ascertained. Noting down how much money is being offered for it by various people, you have to come back.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The disciple started towards the market place with the stone. At first he came across a woman who sold vegetables. He took out the stone and showed it to her and asked her what she could pay at the most for it. Seeing the beauty and brightness of the stone the female vegetable-seller thought to herself that it could be a good plaything for the children. She said—‘I can give you a ‘seer’ or so of potatoes or raw radishes or any leafy vegetables that you happen to choose in exchange for it ?’ ‘I do not mean to sell it’ saying so when the disciple walked ahead he came across a merchant. He enquired of the business man how much he could pay for that stone. The business man thought to himself for a while that the stone was, of course, very bright and beautiful and that it could be used in measuring gold and silver. So he said that he could pay one rupee for it. Refusing to sell it when the disciple went farther he arrived at the shop of a goldsmith. Examining the stone the goldsmith argued to himself that it was indeed a very useful thing for him for it could be split up into many pieces to have a number of topaz. So he said he could pay for it rupees one thousand at the most.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Saying ‘I am not to sell it’ when the disciple hopefully went still farther, he came upon a jeweller’s shop. When he took leave of his preceptor before starting on his errand he did not even dare to make a querry at the jeweller’s shop but the upward trend in the price offered for the stone had made him bold enough to do so. Obviously there was a change in his outlook now. His initial concept that it was an ordinary shining stone was now totally falsified. Showing it to the jeweller he expressed the desire to know his estimate of it. On close examination the jeweller found that it was a diamond and bade one lakh rupees for its price. Of course, it was not for sale. So giving him the same reply he approached the best of the jewellers. They all examined it jointly and valued five crore rupees as its price. Then the disciple approached the king who, having greeted him, warmly summoned all the prominent jewellers and asked them to ascertain its accurate value. After making consultations with one another they expressed their amazement and said—‘Your majesty, we have never before come across such a priceless jewel. So, it is beyond us to fix its price. In our humble estimate even if you part with the whole of your territory you cannot adequately pay its price.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king asked the disciple how he came across such an invaluable jewel. In reply he informed the king that it was given to him by his preceptor for the purpose of ascertaining its price but added that he was not permitted to sell it. The king very politely said—‘It is more valuable than even my kingdom. If your preceptor desires to sell it, I shall gladly part with my kingdom to get it in exchange. Better you consult the revered saint.’ He was acknowledged by everyone to be a saint of a high order. So everyone bade his disciple a respectful send off.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Returning to the Mahatma the disciple narrated the whole story and in the end suggested that since the king was ready to part with the whole of his kingdom to pay its price, in his humble opinion he must sell it off. The Mahatma said—‘Even the kingdom cannot adequately pay its price. So far nobody bade its price corresponding to its value.’ The disciple exclaimed in surprize that no price offered for it could be greater in value than the kingdom. Then the Mahatma asked—‘Is anything made of iron, available here?’ The disciple replied—‘Yes sir, some travellers are staying in the hermitage. They have many utensils made of iron such as tongs, pincers and iron plates (for baking chapatis) etc., if you so desire, I should bring some of them to you.’ The Mahatma bade him do so.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The disciple brought in a number of utensils made of iron. No sooner did the Mahatma bring them in contact with the stone than they turned into pure gold in the twinkling of an eye. The disciple was astonished to see this. Being astonished he asked—‘It seems to be something quite extraordinary. What could it be, my preceptor ?’ The Mahatma replied that it was the philosopher’s stone whose touch alone converts iron into gold. Now you yourself tell me what should be its price. The disciple said—‘In this world gold is regarded as the most precious thing but even that value is transmitted to it through this stone, how then could its exact value be determined ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Mahatma said—‘The Divine Name is more valuable than even the philosopher’s stone for the latter is a lifeless thing and through it we can get only lifeless things but not God who is the embodiment of Knowledge, Truth and Bliss. So it is unwise to draw any sort of comparison between the Divine Name and any earthly possession whatsoever. A man bent upon drawing such a comparison is no way less foolish than the man who would sell the philosopher’s stone in exchange for potatoes or raw radishes weighing a seer or so. Just as without knowing a philosopher’s stone as such, the man possessing it ever remains poor in spite of possessing it, so also the man who does not know the importance of the Divine Name ever remains poorer in respect of love divine and adoration. You do not know the glory of the Divine Name, its true aspect and secrets that is why, you prescribed the use of the name ‘Ram’ thrice for the treatment of an ordinary ailment. The name which is capable of destroying the most horrible feast of birth and death, to use the same for curing an ordinary ailment displays your sheer ignorance. It was with the view to dispel your ignorance that I sent you with the philosopher’s stone. Hearing these exhortations the disciple clearly knew the glory of the Divine Name and repeatedly asked for the forgiveness of his fault.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The story teaches us that if a person does not know the effect of the philosopher’s stone, he is likely to sell it only for a few rupees due to his ignorance. Had the Mahatma instructed him to sell the stone for a reasonable price, he would have sold it at the most for five to seven seers of potatoes or for a rupee or so and he would have supposed this much of price as adequate. Likewise, the persons who are unaware of the secret effects of the Divine Name, make an abuse of it by trying to procure money, wife and progeny through it.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Secrets of the Divine Name</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is beyond all doubts that the Divine Name wields such big power as can root out the sins completely. The saying <span class="char-style-override-7">‘नाम अखिल अघपुंज नसावन’</span>(The Divine Name is capable of destroying mountains of sins) contains a great deal of truth in it but men ignorant of its secret powers, make an abuse of it. They hold the belief that as the Divine Name wields a great power, they are free to commit sins for the present just to wash them off afterwards by reciting the Divine Name. In this way they allow themselves to be caught in the mire of sins. They fail to observe that if their suppositions were right, the repetition of the Divine Name would, instead of destroying sins, increase them all the more, for in that case all people will be led away to commit sins at their own free will so that the number of sins committed in future will be far greater than the number committed at present. Just as a person who commits a theft after putting on the police uniform, is entitled to greater punishment than ordinary thieves, in the same way a man who commits sins under the shield of Divine Name, is entitled to greater punishment, for his sins become terribly ineffaceable and one could be exonerated from them only through undergoing the due punishment for such sins. To commit sins under the shield of the Divine Name, is one of the ten types of blasphemies committed in respect of the Divine Name. The following verse describes the ten errors committed in respect of the divine names—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सन्निन्दासति नामवैभवकथा श्रीशेषयोर्भेदधी-</p>
<p class="Shlok">रश्रद्धा श्रुतिशास्त्रदैशिकगिरां नाम्न्यर्थवादभ्रम:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नामास्तीति निषिद्धवृत्तिविहितत्यागौ हि धर्मान्तरै:</p>
<p class="Shlok">साम्यं नामजपे शिवस्य च हरेर्नामापराधा दश॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1—Censure of virtuous souls devoted to the remembrance of and meditation on God. 2—The description of the glory of Name among those who are devoid of faith and reverence in the Divine Name. 3—Making discrimination between the names and aspects of Lord Shiv and Lord Vishnu. 4—6—Lack of faith in the excellence of Divine Name as described in the Vedas and the scriptures or as enunciated by one’s preceptor. 7—Apprehension that the glory of Divine Name is nothing but false praise. 8-9—Indulgence in prohibited acts and non-performance of the duties enjoined by the scriptures on the strength of Nam-Jap. 10—To treat Nam-Jap at par with other religious duties and rites (Such as gift of a cow to Brahmin or bathing in the Ganges).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The secret to the Divine Name is not revealed to those who practise the Jap of Divine Name without avoiding these ten impious acts.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The inarticulate repetition of the Divine Name is hundred times better than the articulate repetition through tongue and in ease that mental repetition of the Divine Name performed with love and reverence, yields infinitely good results and again if it is practised in a secret manner disinterestedly, it enables one to attain God-realization speedily. One should take resort to the Divine Name only after acquiring a thorough knowledge of this mystery.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Reality of the Divine Name</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Essentially there is no difference between the name and the person bearing that name. In spite of their apparent differences they are inseparably one and the same. In the Gita the Lord says—<span class="char-style-override-10">‘यज्ञानां जपयज्ञोऽस्मि’</span><span class="char-style-override-7"> </span>(X.25). ‘Among the Yajnas I am the Yajna known as Jap’ that is to say that other Yajnas are means to His realization but the Yajna known as Jap, is His very Self. He who bears this in mind and rightly understands it, never fails to remember the Divine Name even for a moment.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">The Attributes of the Divine Name</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who repeats with reverence the Divine Name constantly and at all times, becomes an ocean of virtuous qualities. Just as unfathomable water is contained in an ocean, so also such a person is endowed with innumerable virtues. This implies that the Name is like a seed. Just as when a seed is sown, it sprouts up into a seedling and in due course the same seed bears leaves and fruits and attains the stately height of a full grown tree, likewise a man, practising Jap, develops all the virtues in him as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">To this end one should endeavour to understand the virtues, glory, reality and mystery of the Divine Name. Such understanding is sure to arouse in one, profound reverence for the divine names and the Jap, thus performed with faith and reverence, instantaneously yields the best fruit. So, in order to develop profound reverence for the divine names we should try to have association with the virtuous souls. In case such association is not available, one ought to contemplate on scriptures containing the description of the reality, mystery, virtues, glory and such reference as are capable of arousing love and reverence in one’s heart. By practising Jap that way, one is inspired with love and reverence for the Divine Name and one may be able to perceive clearly the results of Jap practised strictly in accordance with the descriptions in the scriptures.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Motive: The Predominant Factor in God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this world motive is more predominant than action itself. Even a menial and small action with higher motive can be helpful in attaining salvation and even the superior action impelled by a baser motive may cast one in the infernal regions. For example, if one performs Jap, penance, Yajna, meditation and rituals, offers prayers and hymns or studies the religious books with devotion, in order to cause others harm or ruination, the doer has to descend to the inferno in consequence of his action. The actions mentioned above, such as the performance of rituals etc., in the prescribed manner are meritorious deeds in themselves, yet being prompted by Tamasic motive, cause the doers descend into the wombs of lower creatures or fall into lower regions after death. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जघन्यगुणवृत्तिस्था अधो गच्छन्ति तामसा:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Gita 14.18)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘While those of the Tamasic temperament rooted in error, sloth and sleep etc., descend into the wombs of lower creatures or fall into infernal regions.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When these actions are performed with the desire for getting wife, money and progeny etc., or for recovery from some disease, then the motive being Rajasic, one attains the middle state. The sum and substance is that with whatever motive a man is inspired to do an action, the fruit of the action is invariably in accordance with the same motive. When those very actions mentioned above are performed for duty’s <span>sake with disinterested devotion and for God-realization,</span> these very acts bring about the purification of the inner senses and ultimate realization of God. Thus the same action on account of a change of motive may yield one the excellent, the middle and the lower fruit. An action, considered to be menial in itself, may help one attain salvation if one has a higher motive behind it. For example bringing up of children and educating them as parents and teachers, to remove their excreta, to perform surgical works as a doctor, to carry about faggots for providing fuel, the purchasing and selling of articles in a justifiable manner, to work and serve as menial servant, so much so that even to remove the night-soil for the purpose of sanitation which are looked down upon as menial work—even if all these are done in a disinterested and loving spirit, considering them as one’s duty, these can serve as means to God-realization and subsequent to the purification of the inner self caused thereby and when these actions are motivated by desire, these become the source of earning money only and paving way for rebirth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that Bhilani (Sabari—a woman of denizen tribe) used to sweep the paths, clean and remove the filth and thorns from them and gathering wood in the forest would keep them near the hermitage of the Rishis and sages. These may appear to be menial type of work but since she did them with a disinterested spirit considering them to be her duty, so far having a good motive, she attained God-realization— subsequent to the purification of her inner senses.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A story occuring in the Padmapuran runs as follows—When the Brahman named Narottam approached Tuladhar, a Vaishya by caste, he was busy dealing with his customers. So he said—‘I am not free at present. This rush of customers will continue for three hours after sunset. If you cannot wait so long, go to noble Adrohak. The secret of how you caused the death of a stork and why your ‘Dhoti’ has ceased to dry up in the sky, will be revealed to you forthwith.’ The Lord who was accompanying Narottam in the guise of a Brahman said—‘Let us go to the house of Adrohak.’ When they proceeded towards the house of Adrohak, Narottam enquired of him on the way how Tuladhar had come to know that he had caused a stork to die. The Lord told him that in buying and selling, his dealings with everyone are always truthful, honest and impartial that was how he had the knowledge of all the three times (the present, the past and the future). It was for this reason that the Lord stayed at his house in the guise of a Brahman and at the end of his life Tuladhar, the Vaishya, seated in a chariot car with the Lord ascended to His Supreme Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the point for us to consider is that though the actions of Tuladhar Vaishya, concerning the buying and selling of drugs, are apparently not of a high order yet on account of his selflessness, truthfulness, honesty and unbiased dealings, the same actions became so ennobling that these made him capable of attaining the supreme state. This goes to prove that one’s motive is predominant and not one’s action. So it is desirable for us that whenever we undertake a work, we should do it with an excellent motive. When the lowest action can be helpful in the attainment of the supreme state, the results must be excellent beyond all doubts if the best of motive and the best of actions go hand in hand. To press this point farther, a story is being narrated below—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once there was a devotee of God who practised spiritual discipline. Staying under the shade of a Peepal tree he performed remembrance and meditation, recited the Gita with devotion, served the hermits and the sages, performed penance and observed fasts. Once the sage Narad arrived there. The Sadhaka served him whole-heartedly. Thereafter when Naradji was about to depart, he enquired of him as to where he was going. Naradji told him that he was going to visit the Lord in His Celestial Abode. He bowed his head at the feet of Narad and with folded hands eagerly but in all humility asked him if he would enquire of the Lord on his behalf as to when he would grant him His perception. Naradji said—‘Why not ? I shall ask him and convey to you His reply.’ Saying this Naradji left that place and singing the praises of God and reciting the divine names, reached the Celestial Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord asked—‘Where do you come from, Narad?’ ‘One of your devotees, sitting under a tree, is lost in remembrance of and meditation on you and is performing penance for your sake. For the present, I come from thither. O Lord, his sense of service, adoration, meditation and penance are all praiseworthy. He has asked You through me as to when he would be blessed with Your perception’. The Lord said—‘Narad, better do not ask Me that’. This made Narad more curious. He said—‘Why not, my Lord ?’ At this the Lord said—‘If he continued performing remembrance and meditation, service and attendance and penance that way, the vision is likely to be much delayed. It will take him as many years as there are leaves in that Peepal tree, in case he continues his practice that way.’ Naradji was stunned to hear the answer, he was much surprized and he said—‘But, my Lord, he is performing service to sages, Jap and meditation and penance <span>etc., very devoutly. What should be the cause of such delay</span> ?’ The Lord said—‘Narad, you are unaware of the secret thereof. Please convey to him whatever I have said.’ Then Naradji further conversed with the Lord on various subjects like adoration, love, knowledge and dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Coming back from there, Naradji approached the devotee sitting under the tree. As soon as he saw Naradji he fell at his feet and very impatiently asked him—‘Revered sir, was I too a subject of conversation there ?’ Naradji’s heart softened to hear the impatient querry and he said—‘No doubt you were the subject of conversation there but I feel hesitation to report the matter to you.’ The devotee said— ‘Why such a hesitation ? Did the Lord give a blank reply? Shall I not have His perception in this life? Do tell me whatever be my fate. Please do not hesitate for it won’t disappoint me at all.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On his repeated and persistent requests Naradji narrated to him the whole matter precisely and said—‘The Lord has finally sent these words for you that if you practise spiritual discipline this way it will take you as many years to attain His perception as there are leaves on this Peepal tree.’ Hearing this, the devotee was amazed and enraptured as he was, he exclaimed joyfully—‘Will a vile man like me be blessed with the perception of the Lord. Did these words come out of the lips of the Lord Himself ? How fortunate I am ? I am decidedly going to have the perception of the Lord. That’s all. It does not matter when.’ Hearing that he would have the perception of the Lord, the devotee’s joy knew no bounds. His feeling changed altogether. With surfeiting joy and the heart soaked in love, he began to sing the praise of divine attributes and the divine names and began to dance as if he were insane. He was so deeply immersed in the ocean of love and joy that he lost consciousness of himself. Now there could be no delay. The Lord revealed Himself then and there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Naradji was stricken dumb when he came to have a look at the Lord. He spurted out—‘Lord, you said he would have your auspicious perception after as many years as there are leaves on this tree. But nothing to talk of years, within a couple of hours, you have revealed yourself.’ The Lord said—‘The state of affairs was different then, but now things have undergone a change. Don’t you remember I told you that you were unaware of the secret behind it.’ Naradji requested the Lord to tell him what the secret behind it was. The Lord said—‘At that time action was predominant in his practise but at present the motive is predominant. The service to sages, fasting, observing religious discipline, performing of penance and the recitation of the Gita, the association with noble souls, self-study, remembrance and meditation as a means of My worship are, to be sure, the best of actions but so long as these are not compatible with exclusive devotion, delay is but natural. When the devotee, in a state of self-forgetfulness under the spell of exclusive love for Me, is totally engrossed in remembrance of and reflection on Me, then the vision cannot be delayed even for a moment. Just notice the rare and pious sentiments of love in him. At that time though his actions were excellent, such a motive was wanting in him. That is why I had remarked that he would have My perception after as many years as there are leaves on this tree.’ Hearing of this secret Naradji was overwhelmed with love. Overpowered by noble sentiments he lost all consciousness of his own self and singing the divine names and his attributes indulged in a violent dance. The Lord Himself avows so—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (Gita 4. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Howsoever men approach Me, even so do I seek them.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus having been transported into divine ecstasy and love and having been lost in that intense emotional state for sometime, when the three became externally conscious they indulged themselves in a loving conversation. Thereafter the Lord, seated in the chariot car with that devotee, departed to His Supreme Abode and Naradji singing the praises of the divine attribute started towards his destination.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">From this story we should derive the moral that of all the actions the adoration of God is the best and if this adoration is consistent with the disinterested and exclusive love, God- realization is not the least delayed. Therefore, as stated above, excellent actions such as remembrance and meditation should be performed constantly in a disinterested spirit with exclusive love of God.<span></span></p>

The feeling of pride, suppressed hitherto, was clearly visible on his face.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Whoever is brave enough to dare Arjun, the bravest of the brave, to a fight can catch hold of the horse or he must present himself at the appointed time with presents at the Ashwamedh Yajna to be performed by emperor Yudhishthir’ ..... these were the words engraved on the gold plate suspended on the horse’s head. The horse, <span>leading the multitude, was moving gallantly onwards</span> followed by Arjun, the bravest of the brave, along with his large army of armed soldiers marching ahead.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">None dared to cast a free glance at the horse. On their way, ubiquitous welcome was accorded them by kings and emperors they were confronted with and who accepted subordination of emperor Yudhishthir. During its course, the horse reached the city of Mahishmati.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Praveer’s father Neeladhwaj, the king of Mahishmati, felt shudder at the very name of Arjun. He considered it wise not to detain the horse. The brave lady, Junhadevi was, however, disgusted to hear this sad news. She accounted for this act of her husband as cowardice and she tried many ways to inspire him to be ready to accept Arjun’s challenge for war for the fulfilment of his duties as a Kshatriya but Neeladhwaj did not budge an inch from his resolve.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being disappointed with her husband, Junhadevi approached her son Praveer, the devotee, who was as dear to her as her own life and encouraging him to implant himself in the battle-field for safeguarding the honour, she spoke to him thus—‘My son, you are dearer to me than my life, nevertheless, I expect you to defend the country, the race and self prestige. Arjun’s large army and the Ashwamedh horse are offering a challenge to your duties— as a Kshatriya, to your bravery, your sovereignty and your <span>pride in your country. I desire he should not be allowed</span> to go from here maddened with victory. Rise to the occasion; rise at once. By catching the hold of Ashwamedh horse, compel Arjun to retreat from here at the spur of moment. By the shower of your arrows, let not his four-winged army maddened with victories, stay here for a moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Mother, do you mean to challenge Arjun charioted by śri Kr̥ṣṇa....?’ Astonished Praveer had hardly uttered these words when his mother roared out like Durga—‘Yes, the same Arjun. Speak so if you want a moment’s time to ponder over. I myself will break through the large army in order to have a combat with Arjun. I shall suppose I never gave birth to a son.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I shall abide by your orders, mother. Right now,  proceed to the inner parts of the palace.’ Being appeased with Praveer’s words the mother made her way to the inner parts of the palace and Praveer on his part sent a letter to Arjun saying that he was detaining his horse and also offered him a challenge to meet him on the battle-field.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The messenger came back with a reply. Brave Praveer went through its contents which were as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O brave man, I was pleased to go through the contents of your letter that was befitting a Kshatriya. So being much pleased I would like to thank you for that. But you are yet a small child. It is not advisable for you to relinquish the enjoyments of life and feel inspired to enter into the jaws of death’. Praveer at once wrote the reply ‘O bravest of the brave, it is unbecoming of you to use the language of a coward. If you do not mean to fight you may go back. I shall not set the horse free at any cost’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The result was that with the approach of morning the battle started. A sanguine battle was fought. Arjun was bewildered by the shower of sharp arrows of Praveer, the devotee. He asked Pradyumna to shower arrows at Praveer without making any consideration of his tender age. But Pradyumna at once remarked— ‘Like you, Praveer too, is a dear devotee of my father. So when I am reminded of his devotion, my hands lose their firmness and I find myself unable to fight with full vigour.’ Then came forward the most powerful Bhim. But on account of power divinely bestowed on Praveer who had taken refuge in the revered feet of the Lord, Bhim found himself helpless. Seeing this condition of Bhim, Arjun angrily hurled Agneyastra (the fire producing missile) but the terrible flames of fire died out by the rain like shower of arrows shot by Praveer. Likewise the terrible and poisonous arrows which were shot by Arjun to pierce through Praveer’s head, also proved ineffectual. Prince Praveer perplexed and defeated Arjun and his army.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjun’s face, which shone brightly by the reflection of bravery, was overwhelmed by the darkness of sorrow. Meanwhile Praveer approached Arjun and said—‘O Arjun, the bravest of the brave, did you let loose the Ashwamedh horse by the dint of such a power ? I tell you frankly that if you have no love for your life then you can again come into the battle-field tomorrow or you should return home with pleasure and do come here with presents on the day. I shall perform Ashwamedh Yajna with this horse. You cannot gain victory over me without the help of Lord śri Kr̥ṣṇa. If you entertain the desire of defeating me, go and call śri Kr̥ṣṇa. I too, shall be gratified to have His vision.’ For a few moments Praveer was lost in meditation on the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>Praveer’s words</span>, however, pierced through Arjun’s heart like arrows. Now he realized his own mistake of boasting before the Lord. Being perplexed he prayed to the Lord thus—‘O Hari, O Govind, O Supreme Deity; O Narain, excuse me for my uncalled for utterances. You are omniscient, omnipotent and the Lord of all. Come without any delay and help me.’ Hearing Arjun’s pitiable call, the Lord, the destroyer of all the fears of His devotees, appeared there at once as if He were hiding Himself so far, somewhere nearby.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing the Lord, Arjun fell prostrate at His feet. When the Lord turned his looks, he found Praveer too, lying prostrate in obeisance to the Lord. The Lord greeted both Arjun and Praveer. Praveer was overjoyed. Out of ecstasy he said—‘I am gratified to have your vision today.’ Then he addressed these words to Arjun—‘O Partha, I am thankful to you as well. Through your grace I have got the opportunity of having the sweet and enchanting perception of the Lord capable of purifying the three worlds. Let us now retire to our respective camps. Tomorrow we shall fight in the presence of the Lord.’ Then both retired to their respective camps.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing Praveer, Junhadevi hugged him to her bosom and said—‘My son, I am going to offer adoration to Goddess Bhagirathi for the sake of your victory. Praveer’s brave hearted and devout wife, Madan Manjari, expressing her joy said—‘I too shall pray to Lord Kr̥ṣṇa for your victory by winning His favour through my devotion.’ Praveer too was lost meditating on the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Midnight passed thither Madan Manjari, the wife of Praveer, entered the army encampment where everyone was asleep. She had a long unsheathed sword in her hand. As a guard, Lord Shankar stood with trident in his hand. He enquired of Madan Manjari the purpose of her visit to the camp in that hour of midnight with the bare sword in her hand.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Without hesitation Madan Manjari spoke the truth saying that she was Praveer’s wife and wanted to approach Lord śri Kr̥ṣṇa for the protection of her husband’s life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It is not possible. The Lord is asleep. So you should return’—said Lord Shankar.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘If it is so this head must lie at your feet just now’—saying this she raised up the sword.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Curing his own introduction Lord Shankar said—‘I am much pleased with you and am going to Kailas. The sooner I depart from here the earlier my responsibility will cease.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When she approached the gate of the camp of śri Kr̥ṣṇa, the guard at the gate rebuked her and asked her the cause of presenting herself there. Madan Manjari modestly gave this gate-keeper the same reply—‘The daughter-in-law of emperor Neeladhwaj wants to make an approach to the revered feet of Lord śri Kr̥ṣṇa in order to beg for the safety of the life of her beloved husband.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Be gone from here. The Lord is now enjoying His sleep’—said the guard at the gate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Madan Manjari raised the sword and said—‘If you do not allow me to approach the Lord, I shall presently cut off my head and offer it at your feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The guard caught Madan Manjari by the hand but she found that He was none else but Madan Mohan, Shyam Sundar, Lord śri Kr̥ṣṇa<span>—</span>the Lord of the three worlds, for whose sake she had come over there at the risk of her own life. She lay prostrate at the feet of the Lord. After a while she said—‘O Lord, you are all-pervading but I can’t help saying that with the day-dawn the battle between my husband and Arjun—the archer, will start. You are at the beck and call of Arjun and with your help nothing is impossible for him. So I beg of you the protection of him who is my life-breath.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Offering her His Kaumod mace and the thousand forked round wheel called ‘Sudarshan Chakra’, affectionate to His devotees the compassionate Lord said—‘So long as Praveer retains these with him none will be able to kill him in the battle-field.’ Madan Manjari bowed at the feet of the Lord and quickly returning from there, handed the weapons to her husband. She also reported to him what the Lord had said.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the other hand Junhadevi appeased Goddess Ganga and prayed to her to make a request to Shiv to fight on Praveer’s side with the trident in his hand. As soon as Ashutosh heard the request of Shri Ganga he said—‘Arjun is accompanied by śri Kr̥ṣṇa and it is not possible for me to enter the battle-field against him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the morning when Arjun approached his friend śri Kr̥ṣṇa, he found Him worried with His head cast down in anxiety. As soon as He saw Arjun, He said—‘My friend, being satisfied with the devotion of Praveer’s wife, I have offered her both of My weapons and so long as those weapons are with him, you can’t do him any harm. My presence always stands in the way of achievement of your pious aspirations.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord’s words aroused Bhim’s anger and he said—‘You ought to have granted the boons after due deliberation. You are here to protect us, or to add to our miseries.’ But inducing Bhim to control his tongue with unassumed faith, Arjun in a submissive tone said to the Lord—‘Why do you say so, my Lord? I firmly believe that my welfare lies hidden in each activity of yours. The act of offering weapons also involves some interest of mine. I rest, completely assured. You are the summum bonum of my life. It was none else but you who have inspired me to perform this religious undertaking of Yajna and have also given assurance for its unobstructed accomplishment. You should do as you deem proper.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord śri Kr̥ṣṇa was silent. He was concerned about Arjun who relied on Him. He was unable to speak out. Arjun again said—‘Lord, the day is about to dawn. The time for battle is fast approaching. What have You to say, now ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—‘Let us go to Lord Shankar. He can think out some device’. Both of them approached Lord Shankar. There śri Kr̥ṣṇa said—‘Being enchanted with the devotion of Praveer’s wife I offered, for the sake of her husband, My Kaumod mace and the disc, too. So long as they are with Praveer nobody will be able to kill him on the battle-field. We have come to your goodself to know the device by which Arjun can gain victory under such circumstances’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shri Shankarasked Him how in spite of being omniscient He granted her the boon. Kr̥ṣṇa replied that just as He (Shri Shankar) being enchanted with her devotion, left for Kailas in the night, in the same way her devotion prompted Him (śri Kr̥ṣṇa) to grant the boon.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Shankar spoke softly—‘I, too, am in a precarious position. Being pleased with the adoration of Praveer’s mother Junha, Shri Gangaji is insisting that I should fight against Arjun with my trident. Here is your insistence for something else. So I have decided not to fight for either party in the battle-field’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In words expressive of utter disappointment the Lord said to Arjun—‘Well Arjun, I had My access only upto Him and He has given a blank refusal. What should be done now ?’ Arjun replied— ‘Revered sir, I do not understand what to do. I know only this much that whatever you will do will certainly be in my interest. Well, the time for battle is drawing nearer’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord thought for a while and then accompanied by Arjun, He approached Goddess Uma. There He narrated to her the pledge of Yudhishthir to perform Ashwamedh Yajna, the obstruction caused by Praveer and also the fact of His granting the boon and the offering of the two weapons and requesting for the victory of Arjun. He told her that if she came to the battle-field in the form of a lady endowed with bewitching beauty and took back the weapons from him then both of us should be free from all anxieties. Goddess Uma said—‘Be it so’. This was what śri Kr̥ṣṇa aimed at. So he returned with Arjun.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Arjun reached the battle-field he found Praveer waiting with his large army to fight with him. When the battle was yet to start, Praveer beheld a youthful lady, endowed with matchless charms, in the sky just in front of his eyes. He could not imagine that such incredible charm could ever exist in this world. The Lord’s potential power (Maya) which is capable of doing things beyond imagination, aroused infatuation in the mind of Praveer who was a devotee and exercised control over his senses and like a voluptuous and lustful man he began to pine for the love of the goddess. Such is the glory of the divine potency (Maya).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The exceedingly beautiful goddess said—‘Talks of love in the battle-field seem to be the ejaculations of a mad person. If you really mean to win my love you must cast away your weapons.’ Overpowered by infatuation Praveer lost his wits at the moment. He cast away the two weapons given by śri Kr̥ṣṇa. She took them up and soon disappeared. The curtain of illusion was now drawn aside and when Praveer came to himself he began to repent and said to himself that he had quite ruined himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At last he came to the conclusion that it must be the work of the Lord Himself. With loving resentment he said to the Lord—‘O Lord, why did <span class="char-style-override-11">Y</span>ou pose to offer me the weapons when You had the intention of taking them back with the help of Your divine potency?’ In reply to it the Lord said—‘My favourite dear Praveer, I did not take back the weapons. If my intentions were to keep them with Me why should I have given them to you ?’ Praveer retorted—‘My Lord, if it is so, it is not proper for you to help Arjun. I too, regard You dearer than my life. My devotion for you is in no way less than that of Arjun ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing praveer’s words Arjun said—‘O Lord, I have invited You to help me in the battle-field. If Praveer finds himself lacking in power he should set the horse free.’ Praveer angrily remarked— ‘I did not catch hold of the <span>horse only to set it free.’ Soon there was a shower of</span> arrows from both sides. The sky was overshadowed by multitudinous sharp arrows. Notwithstanding that, Arjun found himself helpless. He was on the verge of his defeat.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—‘Arjun, see you Praveer’s superiority. In spite of My help he is fairly on his way to give you a defeat.’ Ceaselessly showering arrows Arjun said—‘My Lord, that is why I have called for Your help. With Your grace I am soon going to defeat him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjun shot sharp arrows but Praveer intercepted them midway. Each and every weapon Arjun hurled was destroyed by Praveer but finally Praveer was defeated by Arjun that day.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Praveer angrily remarked that he regarded it the victory of the Lord not that of Arjun and that he would look upon him as a brave person only when Arjun could defeat him without the help of the Lord. Arjun said that since he had called for His help why should he deprive himself of it and added that if he did not want to fight he might retreat.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing Arjun’s words Praveer at once said—‘O Lord, everyone has his claim over you then how is it that You show favour in the battle-field ?’ It was at this moment that he noticed smile on Lord’s face—a smile that could entice the entire world. Finding Him in favourable mood Praveer at once dragged Him from Arjun’s chariot and made Him sit in his own. The Lord took the reins in His hand. With a highly inflated notion of pride Praveer said—‘Arjun, you are now at liberty to fight to your heart’s content. Now either you have to flee for your life or lay down your life in the battle-field ?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Instead of giving any reply to Praveer, Arjun said to the Lord—‘O Lord, I can’t sustain life without You. Please come to my chariot. It was I who called You’. At this the Lord ascended Arjun’s chariot and took charge of the horses’ reins.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dejectedly Praveer said—‘O Lord, would that You were my charioteer at least through one battle!’ Then he told Arjun that he would see his valour that day. Very cautiously Arjun started showering sharp-pointed arrows. But Praveer was no ordinary warrior. Arjun was bewildered when he came face to face with Praveer. Meanwhile the Lord spoke—‘You aren’t able to gain victory in spite of My help’. Hurling a terrible fire-producing missile Arjun said— ‘Revered sir, please wait a bit, I am soon going to give him a defeat.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But all in vain. By the use of missiles Praveer was no doubt defeated but he rebuked Arjun and said—‘Those who gain victory by other’s support are not reckoned as brave. You have little valour in you to defeat me without the help of the Lord’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then he said to the Lord—‘Both of us claim you to be ours. Give up working as a charioteer to Arjun and look at our warfare impartially. Then only you will see for yourself which of us is a true warrior. And Arjun too will bear the brunt of fighting’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord began to laugh. Praveer, the devotee, finding the Lord in a favourable mood, once again dragged him from the chariot of Arjun and tied Him to a palm tree. Then he said to Arjun—‘Arjun, now you are at liberty to show your bravery. Now you shall get from me the real taste of fighting.’ But looking pathetically at the Lord, Arjun said—‘My Lord, did I send for You to be a passive observer ? In the assembly of Kauravas even the bravest of the warriors could not make You a captive. How then do you stand tied here ? I am perplexed. Make haste my Lord and take charge of the reins of my chariot.’ The Lord having incredible power, the recitation of whose Name even once can break all the worldly bonds, stands tied with the love-string of His devotee! But on the other hand the devotee too is at par with the Lord. His pitiable cry is attracting the Lord. Hearing his pitiable appeal He broke the strings that tied Him and took His seat in Arjun’s chariot, and began to drive it. The Lord is in a precarious position now. In the mutual emulation of His loving devotees, He has become Love incarnate and is indulging Himself in unimaginable divine play.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Praveer could not help himself. He again said to the Lord—‘O Lord, it is surprizing indeed that You could not remain impartial even for a short while and look patiently at Your two devotees fighting and displaying their gallantry. But You are at liberty to do as You wish’. Then he addressed these words to Arjun—‘You have not a fibre of what goes by the name of bravery. It is highly undesirable to try to defeat a warrior in the battle-field by the dint of others.’ And being driven to anger he shot innumerable sharp arrows and hurled divine missiles that bewildered Arjun and made the whole of his army so sorely wounded that it had to disperse. Here too it was the divine play that was at work.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Expressing his sense of wonder at this the Lord said— ‘If such is your condition in fighting single handed with Praveer, poor would be your performance if you had to fight with other warriors ?’ At the spur of the moment Arjun reminding <span>his army men—ready to flee away, of</span> the glorious state attained by brave Kshatriyas who die in the battle-field and appealing to their high sense of self-prestige encouraged them to continue the battle. The large army of Arjun once again fought tooth and nail with Praveer’s army. Arjun too, started shooting arrows in an unprecedented manner. The two parties were using their force for victory. Thus through many ups and downs Praveer was finally defeated that day and Arjun stood victorious.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But Praveer, the warrior, was not the least concerned. He again rebuked Arjun saying—‘Arjun, please try to be truly brave. If you were to fight without the help of śri Kr̥ṣṇa even your life should be at stake’. Then he said to the Lord—‘O Lord, I, too, am one of your devotees. But till now You have been making a discrimination between both of us. Why do You do so ? You are the greatest object of my hope, My Lord’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord burst into a smile—Considering Him to be favourable to him, Praveer at once dragged Him and again tied Him tightly to a palm tree nearby and said—‘O Lord, promise this time that You will witness the battle unconcernedly without displaying any favour to either party.’ The Lord smiled to express His implicit consent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Without any loss of time Praveer jumped off and ascended his chariot and placing an arrow on his bow said—‘O Parth, now you should escape for your life or lie at rest here in the battle-field.’ The Lord was now bound with His pledge. Tied though the Lord was, He was smiling as if He were feeling pleasure in His helplessness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But Arjun was intently looking at the Lord. He said—‘O God, You are enjoying Your divine play and here I am, struggling for my life. I have become impatient. While fighting with the Kauravas You had made a pledge not to wield weapons for my sake but You broke Your vow for the sake of Your devotee. The life of the same Arjun, Your dearest devotee, is in danger. So please break Your vow and rush for my rescue.’ At once the Lord revealed Himself in the chariot of Arjun. He was smiling as usual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being confused Praveer said—‘My Lord, what did You do ? Broken Your own vow !’ The Lord retorted—‘I made no pledge at all.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Displaying loving anger, Praveer, the devotee said—‘O Lord, if You Yourself tell a lie what would be the fate of the world. You promised You will witness the battle unconcernedly but You have again come back and seated Yourself in Arjun’s chariot.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—‘Please, show your resentment to one who made such a promise.’ When Praveer cast a glance at the palm tree he found the Lord still tied to it. He cast a glance first at Arjun’s chariot and then at the palm tree. The same Lord had assumed double forms. Then Praveer said to Arjun—‘You are very fortunate and fortunate are your parents for whose sake the Lord had to assume double forms.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now Praveer began to look intently at the Lord tied to the palm tree. The tide of love, lying hidden in his heart, revealed itself and rose up. He was in a state of self forgetfulness. The constantly renovating, perennial and supernal beauty of the Lord that conjures the hearts of gods and sages also, cast such an unimaginable spell on the heart of Praveer that he lost all his consciousness of the world. He was immersed in the ocean of nectareal beauty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just then the Lord said to Arjun—‘Off with the head of Praveer’. Arjun said—‘Praveer is yet lost in meditation on You. It will be against all ethics to kill him at such a time.’ At once the Lord said—‘Who can dare kill Praveer, My devotee, face to face in the battle-field ? I so desire that My devotee should attain My Supreme Abode while he is yet lost in meditation on Me. I ordain you to kill him. You will be exonerated from the sin of killing.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjun shot a very sharp rare weapon of the shape of the crescent moon which cut off Praveer’s head and caused it to roll up to the feet of the Lord. A very transparent light emerged from it which entered the most pious and auspicious body of the Lord. With the passing away of Praveer the rest of his army fled away. There was gloom throughout the city known as Mahishmati.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing of Praveer’s death his father began to lament and the mother crying over her son’s bereavement but taking pride in his sacrifice as a brave man and the immortal place he had merited in the other world as a devotee and a brave man, said—‘Having been severed by the arrows of Arjun, O son! you have attained the Supreme Abode of the Lord and I have proved myself, as the worthy mother of a Kshatriya lad. Blessed is my birth.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Meanwhile the Lord arrived there. He said to Junhadevi who was mourning for her dead son—‘You need not worry. If you want I can bring Praveer back to life.’ Junhadevi said—‘Who would like to be reborn after embracing death before You, but we, the husband and wife desire to attain the same blessed state which was granted to our son.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Uttering ‘Be it so’ the Lord said—‘Now emperor Neeladhwaj should see Arjun off with due deference and should attend the Ashwamedh Yajna of emperor Yudhishthir at the appointed time with presents to offer him’. And with these words the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">According to the behest of the Lord Neeladhwaj extended a warm farewell to Arjun and was lost in the chanting of the Divine Name. Madan Manjari who was faithfully devoted to her husband, having burnt herself alive with her dead husband, attained the Supreme Abode of the Lord.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">The World: A Garden</p>
<p class="Shlok">कुरङ्गमातङ्गपतङ्गभृङ्गमीना हता: पञ्चभिरेव पञ्च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एक:प्रमादी स कथं न हन्यते य: सेवते पञ्चभिरेव पञ्च॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The deer, the elephant, the moth, the bee and the fish— all these five, being deluded by one of the sense organs are doomed to death. Why should then the negligent person who enjoys the sense objects with all the five sense organs, be not doomed.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So it is desirable of a man to control his mind and the sense organs and to divert them towards God. There is a parable relating to this subject—There was a universal monarch. Once he got it proclaimed that he would designate the man crown-prince who would have a look at him the next day. The garden in which he had his residence would be open for all and sundry, so any body could make an access to him. The entrance would be free for all. Every man would be allowed two hours’ time for walking through the garden. None would be allowed to stay there for more than two hours. Half a minute’s time would suffice for making an approach to him, after one had entered the garden, for there were a number of smooth and convenient passages. As such the person who would be able to have a look at him within the allotted time, would be designated as the crown-prince and he who would dally in the garden all the time, would be turned out of the garden after the expiry of two hours’ time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This proclamation was made public throughout the empire. So, without any delay people began to enter into the garden unceasingly soon after it was morning. The manager had his residence at the very entrance of the garden. The manager would issue a ticket to anyone who sought entrance i<span>nto the garden and would keep the counterfoil with him. In this way people began to enter the garden with their tickets. After entering the garden some people began to roam about in the garden breathing in the sweet smell of different varieties of jasmine, pandanus and the roses and enjoy the cool, gentle and fragrant morning breeze. Some went ahead and plucking the dry fruits and the sweet fruits began to eat them. Others went still farther and began to enjoy circus, theatre, cinema, the zoo and other interesting shows and feats and to have a look at a variety of gold and silver coins and heaps of jewels and to enjoy the sight of a number of strange things not seen by them ever before. Still others went farther onwards and lying down on the soft bed of flowers started billing and cooing with the fair sex and a few went ahead of them and began to enjoy the songs on gramophones and radio sets. Thus being engrossed in luxuries and enjoyments of the garden they were deprived of the opportunity of having a look at the king and fondly thought that it was beyond their capacity to have a look at the king. From amongst them only one person who was endowed with dispassion and whose mind and senses were under his control, despising all these luxuries and delicacies of taste and dandiness, could make an access to the king and it was he who was designated crown-prince by his majesty,the emperor.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A number of guards deputed by the Manager took round of the garden. They took back tickets from those who had finished their allotted time and turned them out of the garden. But the gentleman who loitered about inhaling fragrance of the flowers would request them to let him stay for sometime more. But since the guards were deputed for the purpose nobody could stay even for a minute longer. The guards would push such men and turn them out of the garden by force. Those who were plucking the dry fruits and the ripe fruits and enjoying them would request them to stay there for a few minutes more so that they might pack up the dry and the sweet fruits they had already plucked. The guards retorted—‘Nobody can take any thing from here. Whatever you have eaten up was your share of it’. Saying so they seized the bundles from them and pushed them out of the garden. Many of them had tied money, mohars and jewels into bundles. The guards enquired of them what was inside the bundle and why they had made bundles of it. They replied that the bundles contained money, Mohars and jewels and they intended to carry those with them. The guard began to hit them with staff and said—‘Foolish persons, these were meant only to be seen by you. None can take away even a pice from here.’ They felt grief in parting with the bundles but there was no way out. They were compelled to leave them there. Those who were philandering with the fair sex were not ready to go out at any cost but how could anyone stay there against the rules ! As soon as the allotted time was over they too were turned out of the garden by the stroke of staff. And those who were listening to the gramophone and the radio were unmindful of the time thus spent over it. The guards examined their tickets and asked them to leave the place for the allotted time was over. The listeners desired at least to be allowed to hear the whole of the song that was being played on.<span> But the guards blatantly replied that as their allotted time was over, they could not stay there even for a moment. Saying so and beating them up with staff the guards forcibly turned them also out of the garden.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is a concocted story designed to convey certain morals. This parable should be interpreted in the manner stated below—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">The universal monarch in the story is none else but God and this world is His garden. The proclamations of the emperor are the Scriptures comprising of the Holy Vedas and Smritis. The two hours’ time allowed for going round the garden, is symbolic of man’s life-span. The fact that there is no hindrance in one’s having perception of the king is the proclamation that God-realization is open to all (or attainable by all) without any discrimination. The attainment of the post of the crown-prince is the attainment of supreme benediction. To finish the journey in half a minute to one’s destination by walking along smooth and convenient paths, is the realization of God in six months through the easy and excellent means like love of God and such other means. The manager is none else but Dharmraj—the god of death. The issuing of tickets is the allotment of life-spans. The retaining of the counterfoils of tickets is to maintain one’s life’s account. The entrance into the garden and exit from it represent the act of taking birth and departure from the world. The act of men’s going round the garden here, inhaling the sweet fragrance of flowers soon after their entrance into the garden, represents the men who waste their time enjoying the sweet smell of wreathes of flowers, scents, essence and lavenders etc., on account of being led away by the organ of smelling. The act of enjoying the dry and the sweet fruits represents the act of men who waste their time in enjoying dainties of food on account of being deluded by the organ of tasting. Men enjoying shows and feats etc., in the garden represent the men who waste their invaluable time here in enjoying the sight of the transient, impermanent and wonderful objects of this world on account of being overpowered by their sense of sight. Men philandering with the fair sex lying on the bed of flowers in the garden represent the men who, being overpowered by their sense of touch, endanger their lives in enjoying through touch, the transient and ephemeral objects worth being enjoyed through touching. The act of listening to gramophone and radios etc., in the garden represents the act of men wasting the precious time of their lives in listening to sensational talks overpowered by the organ of hearing. The disappointment, caused by being deprived of having the king’s perception, represents the negligence of the Sadhak on the path of God-realization caused by the lack of necessary faith in the field of spiritual practice. The man endowed with dispassion and exercising control over his mind and senses who straightway makes an approach to the king is here the Sadhak of the highest order worthy of attaining God-realization—the best of all achievements. The perception of the king in the garden represents God-realization and the post of the crown- prince represents the attainment of the supreme state. The guards appointed by Manager who take round of the garden are in this world the messengers of Dharmraj. The expiry of the validity of tickets marks the end of one’s life-span here. The act of turning men out of the garden symbolizes the act of entrusting men in the custody of the god of death. The act of making bundles of money and fruit in the garden is symbolic of man’s acquisitiveness for money etc., displayed even at the approach of death on account of ignorance and infatuation. Guards’ action of beating with the staff, pushing and turning men out of the garden against their wish is symbolic of escorting of men to the kingdom of the god of death by his messengers against man’s wish by using force and torturing them. The prohibition imposed on taking away with one’s money, fruits and dry fruits or anything, represents the fact that one has to depart from this world leaving behind money, wife, husband, progeny, and other worldly objects, for none could ever carry with him any worldly object or aught of anything nor can these be carried away in future. So withdrawing one’s mind and senses from these transient and short-lived objects and the sense enjoyments one should dedicate them to God.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">God Bestows in a Miraculous Way</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You may at your will continue to recite the Gita all day long and try to mould your life in accordance with the teachings of the Gita but at least you must pay a little attention to the task of earning your livelihood’—said one of the younger brothers to the eldest one. The eldest brother applied himself to the task of devotionally reciting the Gita all the time for he had heard that it was better to recite even one chapter of the Gita comprehending its meaning and purport than to recite the whole of it in a mechanical way and that to mould one’s life on its pattern was the best thing one could do. There are certain verses in the Gita by moulding one’s life in accordance with which one could attain blessedness. Of the four brothers it was the eldest who was fond of the Gita. He was trying to mould his life in accordance with verse seventeenth of the twelfth chapter. Even after hearing the above remark of his younger brother, he kept silent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Like us you, too, shall have to make some efforts to earn some money’—remarked another brother who was also younger to him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘How long shall we earn to feed you ?’—the third one endorsed his statement. ‘It is better that you separate yourself from us’—said the first younger brother in excitement.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It’s indeed very difficult for us to pull on with you’, exclaimed still another younger brother in a harsh tone.</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ्क्षति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">शुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्य: स मे प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Quoting the above verse the eldest one replied in a serious tone—Dear brother, this is one of the verses of the Gita. Here the Lord says to Arjun—‘He who neither rejoices nor hates, nor grieves, nor desires, who renounces both good and evil and is full of devotion to Me is dear to Me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While the brother devoted to the recitation of the Gita had not finished his say the third one interrupted and raising the pitch of his voice said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Keep your exhortations with you and seek partition this very day.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I shall neither rejoice nor grieve if you stand by your decision to separate me through partition’—replied the <span>eldest one, devoted to the study of the Gita. ‘Neither</span> I abhor nor cherish the desire for partition. The man freed from rejoicing, grief, desire and hatred is dear to the Lord. So, you are at liberty to do as you deem proper.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘He cannot be restored to his wits unless he is made to live separately. He wants to pass his days comfortably, luxuriously indulging only in the task of sermonizing others’—the first younger brother frankly conveyed his decision.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘For a long time we have managed for his upkeep. We are now fed up’—another younger brother supported the statement of the other, too.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Would that I have to live in the joint family any longer I shall have to cook food for all the three’—cried out from inside the house the shrew (rough natured) wife of the brother devoted to the study of the Gita. ‘Let all the three seek partition. I don’t mind.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘He, who does not rejoice even when he is in an agreeable circumstance, is dear to the Lord.’ The brother devoted to the study of the Gita tried to persuade his wife— ‘You must not speak like that. Moreover, this is decidedly not an agreeable situation, for the Lord had provided an opportunity to serve so many of them (while living in the joint family). It was indeed a matter of great luck for you so you ought to be grateful to the Lord for this.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘These ornaments, clothings, utensils and money have fallen to your share and this small house too has been apportioned to you for your lodging’—saying this the three brothers put the few things that had fallen to his share, before him. All the brothers were excited and the bitter words uttered contemptuously by their sister-in-law had added fuel to the fire.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Lord’s desire is supreme’—replied the brother devoted to the study of the Gita without being agitated in the least. His face as usual had a look of peace and cheerfulness. There was not a streak of anxiety on his face.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘So you are still sitting unconcernedly. How long will things go on like that ?’ taunted his wife. <span class="char-style-override-7">‘न काङ</span><span class="char-style-override-7">्</span><span class="char-style-override-7">क्षति’</span> ‘He who has no desire is dear to Me’ and I have no desire for money for the Lord says ‘He who has no desire is dear to Me’ was the reply.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘How shall we manage when the money is exhausted?’ She hurled another question. <span class="char-style-override-7">‘न शोचति’</span><span class="char-style-override-7"> </span>‘He who is without grief’ was the axiomatic reply. ‘He who is without grief is dear to the Lord so I grieve not for my upkeep’. His wife was rendered speechless.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>‘I have no money with me now. What should I do</span> ?’—the wife asked her husband with anxiety.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">‘न काङ</span><span class="char-style-override-7">्</span><span class="char-style-override-7">क्षति’</span> ‘He who has no desire’—she got invariably the same answer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘No ornament is left on the body’—complained the said wife again after a few days. ‘All of them have been sold off in order to fill the bellies, it is the time now for you to find some way out.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">‘न शोचति’ </span>‘He who has no grie<span>f</span>’—again she received the same curt reply. The wife was disappointed and helpless.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Now we have nothing left with us’—thus began the wife with tears in her eyes. ‘Our house has already been disposed of. The house we live in is a rented one. I have managed to cook food by borrowing utensils from others. Except for a few articles of clothing for both of us nothing remains with us now—neither money, nor clothes, nor ornaments, nor utensils by selling which we can support ourselves. Now you must look out for some work’—insisted the wife hopefully.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">‘न काङ</span><span class="char-style-override-7">्</span><span class="char-style-override-7">क्षति’</span> ‘He who cherishes no desire’—she got the usual answer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘But how will the household be managed ?’ said she impatiently wiping her tears.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">‘न शोचति’</span> ‘He who grieves not is dear to the Lord’—saying this he lapsed into silence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You have a very strange mind, indeed’—said the wife irritably. ‘I cherished the hope that you would do something when things came to naught. But here I am too sick of repeatedly hearing all this— <span class="char-style-override-7">‘न शोचति’ ‘न काङ्क्षति’</span> meaning that the Lord is favourably disposed to one who neither cherishes a desire nor grieves.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The man devoted to the study of the Gita began thus—‘Owife, believe or not but it is a fact. After attending the call of nature when I went to the river bank this morning. I found the stream apparently dry on the surface but there was an undercurrent of water underneath. As I was making a pit on the bank in order to get water, I came upon a large cauldron full of precious gems and gold coins. I wasat once reminded of Lord’s utterance—‘He who does not rejoice on attaining his desired object is dear to Me’—so even at the sight of that treasure of precious gems, I did not rejoice at all. The Lord says—He who does not hate either—so I did not even throw it out of its place. I had no desire for it so, burying it again as before, I came back. I am not at all grieved at having renounced that treasure of precious gems. Thus by the grace of God I neither rejoiced nor hated, neither grieved nor repented. True it is that I did not bring it home all the same. I do not even cherish the desire to keep it with me or should anyone go and bring it for me; for the Lord says—‘the relinquisher of good and evil actions is dear to Me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The wife got annoyed and said—‘You may not cherish such a desire but I do.’ At this the learned Brahman suggested that she should not.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Well, here we have a black cobra !’—cried one of the thieves with an alarm. The man devoted to the study of the Gita is, to be sure, very cunning. He must have sensed that we have broken into his house. That is why he indulged himself in such misleading talks and in order that we might be bitten by the serpent, he has cheated us by declaring that the large basket contained diamonds and emeralds’—whispered another thief.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘His wife, too, is no less cunning’—remarked the third one. ‘The devils have joined hands to outwit us. In fact they had the evil design to put an end to our lives.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>‘</span><span>Why</span> <span>shouldn’t</span> <span>we</span> <span>pay</span> <span>them</span> <span>back</span> <span>in</span> <span>their</span> <span>own </span> coins<span>?’</span> suggested the fourth one. ‘The basket containing the serpent should be hurled into their cottage so that his mannerism of saying <span class="char-style-override-7">‘न शोचति’ ‘न काङ</span><span class="char-style-override-7">्</span><span class="char-style-override-7">क्षति’</span>—‘He who does not grieve.’ ‘He who does not desire’ should come to an end for ever.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As it was when the thieves had entered the house of the Brahman he was telling her about the large basket and the thieves having overheard their conversation had gone to the river bank with the desire to get the riches but when they unearthed the basket and opened the mouth of the basket a fearful black serpent rushed out hissing. The conversation among the thieves, as narrated above, took place on that occasion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All of them consented to the proposal of the fourth thief. Having closed the mouth of the large basket the thieves held it up on their shoulders. Breathing hard they came upto the house of the man devoted to the study of the Gita. Having made a hole into the thatched roof the three of them withdrew themselves from the spot. The fourth one, having overturned the basket at the mouth of the hole, made good his escape. The wife of the learned Brahman woke up to hear the sound produced by the rain of precious stones and gold coins from above. She exclaimed in amazement—‘There is super abundance by the grace of Providence. The Lord has poured in precious stones through the thatched roof.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You must not be puffed up’was the natural outburst of the learned Brahman.‘He who does not rejoice at having attained the desired object is dear to the Lord.’</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘We beg to be excused’—approaching him one day the three brothers said to him shamefacedly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I do not hate anyone. After all you are my brothers. Do not lower me in my own eyes’—the man devoted to the study of the Gita said very affably.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As they uttered the word ‘brother’ from their lips they felt their throats would be choked up, overwhelmed as they were with emotions. They never anticipated to get this sort of affectionate response from their eldest brother. One of them said—‘Ever since partition was made we have been always put to losses. The goddess of wealth and prosperity has altogether stopped visiting our house. We are now burdened with debt. On account of abject poverty we are compelled to lead an accursed and degraded life in the society.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O brother, our lives have become burdensome’—said one of the younger brothers.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The third brother exclaimed—‘We were feeling shy in approaching you. Adversity has compelled us to come to you.’ Again the first younger brother said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You are our uterine brother.’ ‘You are pious indeed. Out of generosity you give a lot of money to the poor everyday. After all we are younger to you so please excuse us’—implored another one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘You may take these gold coins’. The wife of the man devoted to the study of Gita melted to hear the pathetic appeal. She brought some precious stones and gold coins and said—‘There is abundance in my house by the grace of God. He will give us even more.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘God will give us again’—You ought not cherish such a desire;’ reprimanded the Brahman drawing his wife’s attention.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I pray for forgiveness of my fault’. The wife confessed her mistake.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Please allow us to live jointly with you’—prayed one of the younger brothers.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Yes, it would be very kind of you’—insisted another.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By your graciousness we shall be freed from debts and shall get rid of all troubles’—the third one also entreated.</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ्क्षति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">शुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्य: स मे प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> The learned Brahman repeated the above verse which he treasured much. Then he said—‘I have neither any objection nor rejoicing if you want me to join with you again. I shall not grieve if you again ask me to live separately and neither shall I hate you, for the man who relinquishes all—rejoicing, grief, hate, desire and all the good and evil actions is considered to be a true devotee of the Lord.’</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘With your arrival and through your grace our house as well as all the household articles that were pawned, have been redeemed. We are now free from all debts. We are leading a happy life’—said one of the four brothers one day when all the four brothers gathered at one place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The goddess of prosperity has been very merciful to us’—said another brother.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Singing the same verse of the Gita <span class="char-style-override-7">‘यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि’</span>—the wife of the learned Brahman devoted to the study of the Gita, approaching them said—‘Food is ready. Please come along.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Getting ready to have his meal the third younger brother said—‘Like our brother and sister-in-law we too, shall regularly recite the Gita.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘We shall mould our lives according to the teachings of the Gita’—said the youngest one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘In that case our house will become the temple of the Lord’—said another from amongst the younger brothers.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Let it be so by the grace of the Lord’—smilingly blurted the eldest one who was devoted to the study of the Gita.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">This story is written for a devotee who follows the path of renunciation but it can also be good for a man who practises path of action. Thus this verse of Gita is an ideal for every devotee practising Yoga of action.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Farming of the Supreme Bliss</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Dear friend, what could possibly be the purpose of your coming here from so far off a place?’ asked the Punjabi fellow after greeting him, for he thought that there must be some definite purpose of his coming all the way from Rajputana to Punjab.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> ‘We are drought-stricken these days. People are in a sad plight on account of the heavy shortage of food grains and so many people are miserably dying of starvation. Being afflicted I have come to you along with my family.’ The Vaishya from Rajputana narrated the true facts to his friend. He was delighted to see the heaps of grains lying with the friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It’s good that you have come here. Treat this house to be as your own and feel at home here’, replied the Vaishya’s friend very affably.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Well, you have heaps of food grains in your house, but in our state food grains are available only to the few fortunate people at present. There is quarrelling and snatching even for a handful of corns. I am indeed very much pleased to see thousand of maunds of wheat heaped up in your house and have felt sigh of relief.’ The Vaishya presented the true picture.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘By divine grace there is no dearth of foodgrain here and it is no matter of surprize indeed for there is no lack of food grains for anyone who would come up here. Moreover, you are my friend so, whatever you find here by all means belongs to you. It’s well you have come here’, said the friend who was a skilled and experienced farmer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Certainly the things belonging to you are as good as mine as you say, but I would like to know how you managed to have such a vast store of foodgrains’ asked the Vaishya in amazement.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Agriculture is our family occupation. It is the glory of that farming’, the agriculturist friend tried to satisfy his curiosity, ‘If you, too, take to farming you shall also have such heaps of foodgrains.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘That’s a very good suggestion indeed.’ I, too, shall take up farming. But I have no experience of it. I have but a thousand rupees with me. Will this much be sufficient to start with?’ asked the Vaishya.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘An investment of one thousand rupees is in no way insufficient. With this much of investment you can start with fairly well. I shall extend my full co-operation to you’, the farmer sympathetically told his Vaishya friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I am quite ignorant in the matter. You can proceed with the work in the way you deem proper’, replied the Vaishya handing over his entire capital to the cultivator.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘See! all the grains of wheat have gone to the dust. Every grain of wheat has split up and wasted away’, remarked the Vaishya quite dispairingly. He had never interfered with the plannings of his friend—the Punjabi agriculturist. With the money offered by his friend he had arranged for the purchase of seeds and got the field ploughed and the seeds sown. But the unskilled Vaishya was worried to notice all that. Hardly a couple of days had passed when he went to the field, dug up the seeds and began to examine them. He found many of the seeds sprouting which made him feel that all his money was a waste. Extremely shocked at this, he remarked to his friend what has been stated above.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The seeds have started sprouting. You need not worry at all. The seeds are showing a good prospect. You aren’t aware of it’, the agriculturist friend hopefully assured the Vaishya.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I see no prospect of profit in spite of the investment of money and labour. I am much concerned about it’, the Vaishya opened out the anxiety at his heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘In the beginning it is always like that, worry not. You are going to have a good harvest’, replied the agriculturist friend very affably.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vaishya remained silent, for nothing else could he do.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Nothing but grass is visible through the whole of the field. Alas ! I have been put to a great loss. All my money has been a waste’. After the lapse of sometime the Vaishya again complained to the agriculturist friend. The plants of wheat, as tall as the length of a span, were taken for grass by him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being dismayed by the report, the agriculturist went to the field where he was much pleased to see the rich harvest.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Hey! your crop is definitely superior to all those in the neighbouring fields’, the agriculturist friend tried to allay the doubts of his disheartened friend. ‘Take it from me that you are going to have heaps of wheat in the near future. But be on guard, the plants do not get dried up. Water is vital to these tender plants so you must ensure its earliest supply. For irrigating them you must soon get a well sunk and at the same time fence the plants round with thorny bushes lest the animals should enter the field and eat them up. You will have to guard the field with due care.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I shall literally act upon every word of your suggestion’, said the Vaishya and did as he was asked to do. Getting a well sunk, he irrigated the field properly and by the grace of God the clouds too, poured in water at intervals. Now the plants started growing up steadily.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The weeds that have grown up in between the plants should be got removed altogether or they shall impede the growth of the plants’—thus advised the agriculturist affectionately after visiting his field one day.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Not a single weed will be allowed to remain there’, at once answered the Vaishya spiritedly.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The plants have borne ears but the grains are unripe yet’, the Vaishya said to his agriculturist friend after wiping the sweat on his forehead. He had come from the field running and was breathing hard. As per advice of his friend he had left no trace of weeds and grass in the field. His labour was unparalleled undoubtedly; the plants had borne ears but even after being examined after a long interval, he found them all unripe. Being ignorant about farming the poor fellow was rather confused. He thought that besides his money, his hard toiling and sweating were going to be rendered fruitless. He put forth the few ears, that he had brought with him, before the agriculturist.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The grains of your wheat are quite sturdy. These will ripen forthwith. Now there will be no delay. Don’t lose patience. Don’t take things otherwise. You will have high heaps of wheat and straw, piled up into your house’, the agriculturist told the Vaishya joyfully, ‘But at such a time birds often hang about filling our ears with sweet music, yet they eat up all the grains so the crops should be well guarded against them. The field being unguarded,the birds will utterly destroy the crops’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I am so grateful to you. My joy knows no bounds. I am the owner of a large heap of wheat now’, the Vaishya joyfully uttered these words to express his gratitude to the agriculturist.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It is the result of the divine grace and your hard labour as well. Instead of being attracted by the chirping of birds, you were sincerely devoted to the task of warding them off. You did your farming with great application.’ The agriculturist meant to give the credit to the Vaishya friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Vaishya bowed in token of gratitude. His face was ashine with joy.</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">The above story has been narrated as a parable. In the field of spiritual knowledge it can be interpreted in the manner suggested below. The drought-stricken Vaishya should be taken to represent the eager Sadhak trying to achieve happiness. The craving for foodgrains caused by the abysmal hunger of the Vaishya should be taken to represent the Sadhak’s desire for true happiness caused in consequence of worldly hardships. The agriculturist friend of the Vaishya symbolizes a great soul or a saint. The departure of Vaishya from Rajputana to the Punjab is as good as man’s departure from his house to the hermitage of a great soul. Vaishya’s narration of his own misfortune after approaching his friend, is much the same as the narration of the hardships felt by the eager Sadhak in his spiritual practice. The handing over of the entire capital by the Vaishya to his friend is as good as the act of dedicating the remaining part of life, by the Sadhak, at the revered feet of the Mahatma. The expenditure incurred on the advice of his friend is much the same as the utilization of time in accordance with the direction of the Mahatma. The arrangement of land and seed made by the agriculturist should be taken to represent the instructions given by the Mahatma regarding proper use of time. The giving up of personal comforts for the sake of farming should be regarded as the act of giving up the existing worldly enjoyments for the sake of supreme happiness. The sowing of seeds in the field should be thought of as the inculcation of the fundamental divine principles of practice into the mind of the sadhak by the Mahatma. In case of farming, the grief caused by the misunderstanding risen at the time of sprouting of seeds, should be considered to represent the disappointment caused during the spiritual practice and the mental agony arising from it. The taking of small plants of wheat for grass is much the same as the act of the sadhak regarding his practice ineffectual even though he makes steady progress in his spiritual practice. The fence should be supposed to represent the control over mind and senses. The protecting of field from animals is much the same as the preservation of spiritual knowledge being wasted away during one’s contact with worldly men. The continuous irrigation of field is symbolic of concentration on the divine aspect consistent with the remembrance of the divine glory and attributes. The timely fall of rains, as a matter of course, should be taken to represent the effortless availing of the opportunity of association with the great souls and the capacity for sustained meditation.The removal of all the weeds beside the wheat plants, represents the act of doing away with vices and evils from one’s heart. The bearing of ears by the plants should be regarded as steady concentration on God and the sweet songs of birds, hanging about for the purpose of pecking at the corns,symbolizes the adulation of the sadhak by selfish men. The warding off of birds for the protection of crops should be taken to represent the indifference of men indulging in glorification and praise of the sadhak as well as in the extolling the sadhak for the maturity of his practice and the heaping up of wheat after it has been reaped after ripening,should be considered to represent as the symbol of the realization of God, the embodiment of Supreme Bliss subsequent to emancipation from all worldly sorrows.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">Equanimity is Vital and Partiality Fatal</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In a certain village of Rajputana there lived an extremely poor Vaishya (a man of business class). Once it so happened that the village fell under the clutch of a terrible drought. People began to die of starvation. The poor Vaishya also fell a prey to miserable plight. For some time somehow or the other he tried to make his both ends meet. At last finding himself helpless to support his family he set out from the village after arranging, with a great difficulty, a little provision for the upkeep of his family for a few days. In his boyhood days he had a mate whom he had sworn as his brother. Now this man had his business in Assam. He was quite well-to-do. His business was at its brisk. The poor Vaishya was reminded of him and recalling to his memory the saying as it goes—‘A true friend has a hundred times greater affection in times of misery’ he anyhow managed to reach Assam. Arriving at the place where his friend carried on his business, he called on his friend. He was very confident that his friend would naturally welcome him under his roof and that he would be able to pass his hard days comfortably. His friend did greet him but instead of feeling happy at his arrival, feelings of irritation and burdensomeness were slightly visible on his friend’s face. However, the poor Vaishya was stricken with grief. Narrating the whole story briefly, in a very pathetic tone he begged for shelter. He said—‘Your sister-in-law and her children are being starved, it will be proper to send them some money this day. Moreover, I too, should be provided some job so as to enable me to pass these hard days as well as to enable me to send some money to my children every month.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Taking in a deep breath the moneyed friend said—‘Dear brother, You are right indeed. I ought to offer you some help at present. But neither I have much earning these days to be in a position to offer you some help nor I have any job to provide you with. Our total income from house rent, business and from the interest on capital investments, ranges from forty to fifty thousand rupees only. It is not hidden from you how hard the present times are. Still one has to spend money in order to maintain his status in the society. I have got my family, clerks and stewards too. It’s difficult to pull on with all that. Well, how can I support you and your family under these circumstances ? I am sorry for you but I must tell you plainly that I shall not be able to give you any help at present. You must find some other way out.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The poor Vaishya became sad and said—‘I am not familiar with anyone here and have come all the way counting on your help only. Moreover, you aren’t going to spend much on my account. I shall pull on well, if for the present, fifty rupees are sent to Rajputana and if I get some work by which I may earn fifty to sixty rupees as wages. I shall have to spend some of it to meet my personal expenses and the rest will be sent for children’s sake. This much of expense will not be burdensome to you whereas your annual income ranges over fifty thousand rupees. Moreover, I want to earn my wages.’ While saying this tears welled up in his eyes. He was obviously, much agonized to hear the words of his friend. The rich friend looked at his face but he felt no pity for his friend. Again with feigned politeness he repeated the earlier reply—‘Dear brother, what you say is true indeed. But I am helpless. You will have to find some other way out. Of course, you can stay here for a couple of days till you do not manage to get some job. You can eat and drink at my house. But at present you should ease and wash yourself. The food must be ready by now’. Having said this the rich friend busied himself with his own business. The poor Vaishya dwelling on various thoughts enjoyed himself in answering the call of nature and bathing himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The rich friend was cold and by nature miserly but his wife excelled him in these aspects. She did not like anyone visiting their house. Out of courtesy the husband was at times patient enough to go through the botherations of entertaining the guests but the wife would go to the extent of admonishing even her husband. Courtesy demanded that the intimate friend of one’s childhood who visited one’s house must be entertained. So he went in and said to his wife—‘After long a sworn brother of mine has come all the way from Rajputana. He is to be fed. We should entertain him with due respect by offering him the best dishes, we can. He is not only a friend but guest also.’ The great tradition of entertaining one’s guest was not unknown to him so in order to prevent his wife from being irritated, he appealed to her on that ground but even that argument fell flat on her. She burst out—‘Let these friends and guests of yours go to hell. I have developed eye-sore blowing up the oven all the time. These troublesome people come up uninvited everyday— today it is a friend, tomorrow a guest, and the day after a businessman. I am quite fed up with this sort of housekeeping. I am not going to do all that. Please, make some other arrangement.’ Shyly the husband spoke in a low voice— ‘Hey, speak softly. He is standing outside. In case he overhears, he will be much grieved.’ She flared up and retorted—‘It will be all for good, we shall get riddance earlier’. The husband flattering her a little said in a persuasive tone—‘Well, look I have already told him that I have no work for him and that he should find some other way out. He will be off within a couple of days so we shall do well to entertain him according to our status only these few days.’ The wife acceeded to his request and cooked food but still she was unhappy at heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When meals were ready the rich man led his poor guest inside the house. Then his wife suggested him to let his guest first take his food for it was one’s duty to feed one’s guest first and added that he might take his food afterwards. The husband acceeded to her request and fed his guest to his heart’s content. The food consisted of rice-milk sweetened with sugar, puris, curd and many dishes of cooked vegetables but the feeling of warmth and sweet accord was absent from the faces of the hosts. The feelings of coldness and gloom were evident there. It seemed as if they were caught in an unpleasant situation and they had to go through all the formalities unwillingly. The poor fellow did take his food but was unhappy to notice the expression on their faces. In love alone lies true happiness. After taking his food when the poor fellow went out to urinate, the house-wife hurriedly served food for her husband. It consisted of many dishes which were kept concealed from the guest. After making water when the poor fellow came in to wash his hands, unintentionally and very naturally his eyes caught sight of the plate in which his friend was served food. He noticed that it contained pudding of almond. There was a bowl containing the cream of rice-milk and another containing the cream of curd. There were well baked thin chapatis swollen to their full capacity and anointed with fresh butter.There were many dishes of cooked vegetables such as cauliflower and parvar and many kinds of pickles also were there. Noticing all that it became obvious to him that it was on account of this partiality that his rich friend was asked to dine separately. The apparent partiality heightened his despair all the more and having washed his hands he went out of the house without any demur.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the night set in,his rich friend asked his wife— <span>‘</span>Where should we make a bed for the guest?’‘On my hea<span>d</span>! Is it a thing to be asked ? It can be made at any convenient place. Of course, he is not going to sleep inside the house I believe’, blurted the wife irritatedly. The husband said—‘All right, he will sleep on the cushioned planks outside, but the place abounds with mosquitoes. The poor fellow won’t have a sleep’. She flared up at once—‘I have only one mosquito curtain. Either you use it yourself or stretch it over the head of the guest’. He was not unfamiliar with his wife’s temperament. Considering that it was not worth while prolonging the discussion he came out and asked his guest—‘Better you sleep here. The bed is furnished with cushions and pillows. You will find this place quite comfortable’. The poor fellow politely accepted the offer. The rich man went in to sleep there. It was summer season. Mosquitoes were not far to seek. The cushions and the pillows were replete with bugs. As soon as he lay down they filed out in rows and besieged him. He spent the whole night picking out the bugs and warding off the mosquitoes. The poor fellow could not enjoy sound sleep even for a short while.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day he went out of the house and reached the market place. As soon as he reached the crossing, he came across a familiar person of his own village. He too happened to look at him. Poor though he was, he was large-hearted. No sooner did he see him than he ran upto him and affably and joyfully asked him—‘Dear sir, when did you come here? You did not even send me any information. You must have been put to a lot of trouble. Had I been informed, I would have received you at the station. Even after arriving here you did not take the trouble of sending me any message at all. Please tell me where you are staying. Please accompany me to my house. I shall bring in your luggage afterwards. I am lucky enough to have come across you. It is very difficult indeed to find loving persons of one’s locality in a far off place like this.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing his words soaked in true love the poor man’s heart melted. He was greatly consoled by the meeting and he felt like the drowning man who catches at a straw. He narrated to him at length the circumstances which had compelled him to come over there and told him that as for his luggage he had only a Dhoti, a large napkin and a Lota (a jug like pot) which were lying at the house of the rich man. The poor but gentle man said—‘He is, of course, a rich man. But if you regard me as your own, you should better stay at your own house. Feel at home in my humble residence and be contented with the simple food that is cooked here. I am a retailer dealing in miscellaneous articles. I earn two rupees a day. I am all alone. If you stay at mine both of us will cease to feel lonely. If we put in double labour, we shall make double earning or even more. Hard work and sincerity are required. The harder the labour the greater the prosperity. You will undoubtedly be able to send at least fifty rupees to your family every month. We shall try even for more. Don’t be nervous. God must be kind to poor people like us. I have already a balance of rupees fifty and you can send them home right now.’ Saying this he led him to his house. It was a mud walled small house covered with tin but was neat and clean. In the exterior part of the house there was a small shop. Soon after reaching home he took out fifty rupees and without any delay he sent the money by Money Order. The joy and sense of relief, which the helpless drought-stricken man felt at the time, is beyond all description. Then the poor shopkeeper went to the rich man’s house and brought to his house all the belongings of the poor man.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On returning home he said to his wife—‘A gentleman of our locality has arrived. He is an acquaintance of mine. Please prepare food for him’. Being pleased at this the virtuous lady said—‘It is a matter of great pleasure indeed that a gentleman from our locality has arrived at our house today. We are fortunate indeed that God has given us this rare opportunity’. With great love she cooked the food. Rice was cheap those days. Coarse rice was boiled, commonly available leafy vegetables were cooked, coarse chapatis made of the mixed flour of gram and barley and whey too. The house-wife fed both of them observing decorum and without making any sort of distinction or showing any partiality rather she served food to the guest attending on him with greater care, warmth and insistence. On that day he felt greater satiety and pleasure in taking food. The pleasure one derives from taking coarse bread served with love can hardly be derived from dainty dishes. After taking their meals both of them began to look after the affairs of the shop.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At night the poor shopkeeper laid an old cot, woven with ‘Mooj’ strings, which he had bought for three rupees, for his poor guest to sleep on. He spread sacks made of Jute on the cot. To protect him from mosquitoes his wife stretched her thin old head-cover of muslin supported on four splinters of bamboo. The drought-stricken man had no sound sleep the previous night. As soon as he lay down on the cot, he fell fast asleep. He slept soundly for the whole night. All his weariness had gone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Only after a few days, one day the drought-stricken man happened to meet his rich friend on the way. The rich friend courteously asked—‘Have you sought out some work for yourself anywhere ? Where are you putting up now ? Is there adequate arrangement for fooding there?’ He replied—‘Of course a good arrangement has been made. I am putting up at the house of a certain shopkeeper of our locality; the husband and wife are indeed very gentle. I have been given equal partnership in the shop. He sent home rupees fifty the very day. As for fooding he has assured me that in future all of us shall dine together in the house. At least rupees fifty will be sent every month for children’s sake. The arrangement for fooding is also very excellent. I feel great satisfaction by taking nectarean food at their house, so excellent, affectionate and impartial behaviour is extended to me by them that I cannot forget it throughout my life. Hearing these things from him, the rich man’s pride was, however, humbled a little, for there was no exaggeration in the statement. He was not unaware of his own dealings, so there was nothing to be contended; still an idea struck his mind. He was too proud of excellently delicious food being cooked at his house and his house being tastefully furnished with cushion and pillows and chandeliers. Could he ever find these things in the house of the poor man?—he thought to himself. In order to uphold his sense of superiority and with a view to censuring the poor shopkeeper, he said—‘What could you have possibly got there for your food—only coarse rice and coarse bread, vegetables made by cooking cheap leafy things and ground to lie on or some tattered cot at the most. What else could one expect to find in the house of a pauper? You have relinquished delicious food and well-furnished house of mine and gone there. Now you must be repenting for this folly at your heart.’ Smilingly he said—‘Dear sir, you are very rich but for your own sake. Surely you own a house well-furnished with cushions, pillows and chandeliers but to me all these were poisonous. True it is that delicious food is cooked at your house but I have nothing to do with it. I could enjoy neither the comfort of eating nor of sleeping. I was quite fed up with the mosquitoes and bugs. I couldn’t have a wink of sleep that night. I am extremely satisfied with the Mooj-woven cot, bedding of sacks and the curtain made by the tattered head-cover to enable me to have a sound sleep at night. As for food, to tell you the truth, it is excellently delicious. The satisfaction—that I derive from the coarse rice, unanointed bread and vegetables made by cooking leafy things at the house of poor shopkeeper, is hard to find elsewhere. The food offered by you was like a poison but the food offered by him is nectarean to me. You regarded me as a burden upon you. My arrival was troublesome for you, partiality overwhelmed you. Equanimity is vital and partiality fatal—this is what the saints say repeatedly. That is why your delicious dishes containing dry fruits and sweets were like poison to me and even the coarse food offered by the poor shopkeeper is nectarean to me on account of their sense of impartiality. Not only this much the treatment accorded by them is also nectareal. You have a balance of lakhs of rupees and your earnings, too, are not less than that. Besides, you are a sworn brother of mine since childhood nevertheless, neither you agreed to send some money to my hunger-stricken children nor you provided me with some job by which I could earn rupees fifty or so. Whereas the poor shopkeeper being only acquainted with me and in consideration of the fact that we belong to the same village, provided me shelter in spite of his own poverty; managed to send rupees fifty without any delay and made me an equal partner in his business. Well, how can I ever forget his generosity ? Whatever he did for me he did not do it with a view to earn my gratitude, it was all prompted by true love and sense of duty. He does not aim at obliging me rather himself feels grateful to me for having provided me comfort and rejoices at his own blessedness. His wife also shares similar sentiments. That is why their faces are always radiant with joy on account of having exhilaration and hopefulness at heart.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The rich friend enquired of him as to where he had noticed partiality in his house and how is it that there is no partiality in shopkeeper’s house. He replied—‘Surely I was served delicious dishes at your house but as a sort they were poisonous to me. I believe you have not forgotten thatinspite of being a guest. I was asked to dine separately. After taking my food I went out to urinate and when I came back to wash my hands,I noticed the pudding of almonds,butter, thin chapatis, rice-milk, cream of curd and vegetables made by cauli-flower and ‘Parvar’ and pickles etc., were served to you. These things were surely not served to me. Though I am not fond of eating these things, I was grieved to notice that sort of partiality being observed . I believe those things were especially meant to be served to you. That is why your virtuous wife, on the pretext of feeding the guest first, intended to feed you separately. Was it not possible that both of us were served food at the same time? It should have involved only a little more of expense. You, too, did not scrutinize the proposal but readily accepted the proposal of your wife. Is it not reproachable that you treated your sworn brother like that? It was for this reason that the food served by you was as good as poison to me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just look at the treatment accorded to me there. The manis too poor himself but his wife, in an unbiased manner, served food to both of us simultaneously with great love <span>and pleasure whatever she had for food in her house—</span>coarse rice, coarse bread, vegetables made by leaves and whey also. At night they laid a cot, the only cot in the house on which they themselves slept, for me to sleep on. I was provided with sacks for my bedding and his wife stretched her head-cover to serve the purpose of a mosquito-curtain to protect me from nuisance caused by mosquitoes. Such selfless love and equitable treatment of her affected me deeply and it is surely an experience not commonly shared by others. This is why I find nothing but nectar there and recalling to my memory the treatment accorded to me, I rejoice at it and feel exuberance again and again. The rich man making a false pretext said—‘I remain sick very often. I am gradually developing the loss of appetite too, my physician has advised me to take these things.’ At this he remarked—‘In the first place in case of loss of appetite one is not advised to take such things but taking that for granted what should have been the harm if those things were served to me as well?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The richman was rendered nonplussed. He began to repent at heart for his biased treatment and lack of warmth andshamefacedlycast down his head, and went away from there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">It is a fabulous instructive story. From this story we should derive the moral that we ought to treat everyone with love and politeness. We should observe equity in eating and drinking. It does not, however, mean that men should dine with men professing an alien faith and belonging to different race. It only aims to convey that in case of men professing different faith or belonging to different race one should provide such food to everyone, whosoever he might be, with warmth, politeness and respect in a befitting manner and in accordance with the scriptural injunctions. The food that has been prepared for one’s own self should be served to others without making any sort of discrimination and one should take one’s food after feeding others. One’s intentions should be above board and one should not give way to partiality in one’s mind.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">God is Just and Merciful</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Men of different creeds who believe in the existence of God as the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, as sustainer of the world and supremely compassionate, acknowledge that God is just as well as compassionate. The fact is that He is neither exclusively just nor exclusively compassionate. The two qualities co-exist in him at their climax concurrently and in His dealings with creatures the two attributes are at play simultaneously. In this regard some people raise the doubt as to how the two attributes— justice and compassion could co-exist under the sway of his merciful trait. If a judge sitting on the bench does not award punishment to the real culprit deserving punishment or awards him lesser punishment than he deserves, does this act not adversely affect his judgment, or in case he awards the strictest punishment, does his sense of mercy not remain quite ineffectua<span>l</span>? Similarly, dispensations by God also may be affected one’s not bearing justice and mercy simultaneously. Similarly, dispensations by God may be just devoid of Mercy or may be full of Mercy but not devoid of justice.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not an easy job to remove such a doubt. For a man like myself it is but childish to deal at length with the divine attributes or to make comments on them but an humble effort is being made here with a view to extol the divine attributes as well as for the sake of my own amusement. The fact is that man-made laws can never stand at par with the divine laws. Even if a man does not make laws for vested interests, he is certainly affected by circumstances and environment. He cannot be quite unerring in his efforts to probe into future. Errors are likely to creep in on account of infatuation or for some other reason but as regards God there is hardly any chance of error being made. Moreover, God being the inexhaustible treasure of compassion, justice and benevolence the divine laws are also impregnated with mercy, justice and benevolence. The truth is that man who conceives of the world a reality and is devoid of selflessness cannot frame laws displaying his profound sense of justice, mercy and large-heartedness. God, who is motiveless in all respect, friend to all, the supreme being having an ocean of <span>compassion at heart—whose compassion, friendliness,</span> love and affection and such other virtues are abysmally deep, can frame such laws but such a thing is beyond the capacity of the common man. Hence although man-made laws can hardly stand in comparison with the divine laws nevertheless compassion and impartiality may be found to co-exist in man as well. To prove this some examples are being given below—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A businessman named Ram Lal had a sum of two thousand rupees outstanding against Narain Prasad who was Kayasth by caste. Narain Prasad was a truthful and honest man but his entire business went to the walls, for the calamities, that overtook him, were many. All the belongings of his house-hold, so much so that even those ornaments of his wife which were sacred to her, were sold out and he had to take up a small job of forty rupees a month. With this meagre income he was hardly able to support his large family but more could hardly be expected at a time when there was so much of unemployment everywhere. Ram Lal demanded his money times and again but in no way could Narain Prasad afford to pay back the money. Ram Lal filed a suit in the court against him. The judge who was hearing the case was very noble, well versed in laws, a dispenser of justice and merciful also. Presenting himself before the judge he said—‘My Lord, it is true that I owe rupees two thousand to Ram Lal and though I have honest intentions to pay back the money, yet at present I am in very straitened circumstances, I haven’t even a shell in my house, neither I own any property. You can, to your full satisfaction, ascertain this through your own sources. I work on a job of forty rupees a month; my family including the children consists of as many as eight members and with great difficulty we are able to make both ends meet. Still I will pay off Mr. Ram Lal’s debt in annual instalments of rupees two hundred in face of all sorts of hardships. Not with standing that if Mr. Ram Lal insists on sending me to the jail and if you pronounce the sentence of imprisonment, I shall gladly go to the prison but shall not declare myself insolvent, although in that case my family will undoubtedly have to face terrible hardships. Your lordship may do as you deem proper.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the truthful account narrated by Narain Prasad, the judge was satisfied and he said—‘Well, you reconcile yourself with your money-lender. In view of your pitiable condition he ought to condescend to your proposal. Narain Prasad tried his best to explain his position and entreated him again and again but Ram Lal would not yield to his request. So the case was put up before the court and it was proved on evidence that Narain Prasad owed rupees two thousand to Ram Lal. The judge made a querry and found that the facts, narrated by Narain Prasad about himself, were true in toto. Ram Lal himself admitted the veracity of his statement. So in spite of Ram Lal’s objections, the judge passed a decree of rupees two thousand against Narain Prasad to be paid in annual instalments of rupees two hundred as desired by him. Noticing the mercifulness of the judge Narain Prasad was extremely delighted. Does it evince from the judgment that the judge was unjust or biased? Should this action of the judge be regarded as warped by bribe? Why should this not be regarded as an act of mercy? As it is, mercy and justice co-exist in this case. If worldly laws can be so nobly inspired, can the divine mercy and justice be held in contempt in case God passes a decree in favour of His devotee in accordance with his desire?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now please go through the following two examples of criminal cases—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Govind Ram and Ram Prasad lived in the same street. They often entered into arguments with each other. There is every chance of a discussion leading to a quarrel. One day during mutual discussions, it so happened that Ram Prasad flew into rage on hearing an argument that was against his concept. In anger man often loses his discrimination, eventually he dealt Govind Ram a few severe blows. Govind Ram filed a criminal suit against him. As soon as Ram Prasad came to know about it he presented himself before the magistrate and truthfully narrated to him what had happened. He said—‘We were having discussions on some religious matter and Govind Ram’s action of reproaching me was justifiable. But I took very ill of it. I could not control my anger that is why I committed the offence unadvisedly. I am entirely responsible for the fault. I am quite repentant of what I did. Now I am ready to abide by your orders.’ The magistrate said—‘Well I can’t do anything in the matter. You go to Govind Ram and ask for his forgiveness. He can forgive you if he  desires so. This is the easiest way out for you.’ On the suggestion of the magistrate Ram Prasad went to the house of Govind Ram and falling at his feet and confessing his own offence begged for his pardon saying that since he had taken refuge in his revered feet he would have to pardon him in spite of his guilt. Hearing his pathetic appeal and marking the true sense of repentance at his heart, Govind Ram yielded to his request and put in an application for the withdrawal of his case. The magistrate granted the application and honourably acquitted Ram Prasad. Can anyone dare say that on this case any injustice was done either by the <span>magistrate</span><span> or Govind Ram or they failed to show Mercy</span> ? Once upon a time on account of committing offence against Ambarish, the devotee, even Lord Vishnu had to direct sage Durbasa to seek shelter with him and when he got there it was Ambarish who saved his life by offering prayers to the disc. In this case also the sense of justice and mercy were at work simultaneously.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In a certain village there lived a good natured and virtuous man named Shiv Ram. In the same village there lived a dacoit also. Shiv Ram sometimes heard from him the adventures of robberies committed by him. Bad association often leads to dire consequences. One day Shiv Ram was tempted. Greed had polluted his wits so, without considering the pros and cons he robbed off three thousand rupees from the house of a householder named Nand Ram. Those who resisted were beaten with cudgels for self-defence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When he reached home with the booty, he narrated to his wife the story at length. Shiv Ram’s wife was a very virtuous lady who was shocked to hear of her husband’s  deed. She bowed at the feet of her husband and suggested to him what should be his duty and requested him to return the money without any delay. Shiv was indeed a nice man. He was far from being a professional dacoit. It was bad company that had polluted his wits. On the suggestion of his wife, like the flame of a lamp he could clearly see through his crime. On being hinted by his wife he at once went to the collector’s residence with the money and placing the money and the ornaments before him and surrendering himself to him implored thus—‘I have done a great crime. I was prompted by greed which polluted my wits. I unjustly oppressed poor Nand Ram and committed such a heinous crime as was never done by any of my fore-fathers. My guilt admits of no excuse but since I have surrendered myself to you, please protect me. I promise not to commit such a grave crime in future.’ The <span>collector was convinced with what Shiv</span> Ram said. He thought to himself that if Shiv Ram had bad intention he would <span>not have presented himself before the collector with the</span> booty. Detaining him there he sent for Nand Ram through the police. Just at the time when Nand Ram was thinking of going to lodge a report with the police, a constable approached him and told him that the person who had committed the robbery in his house was present at the collector’s bungalow with the looted property and that the collector had summoned him without delay. Nand Ram was much pleased to hear about the recovery of the lost property. He at once accompanied the policeman to the collector’s bungalow. Seeing him Shiv Ram held his feet by the hands and shedding tears begged for forgiveness. Nand Ram would not listen to his appeal and threatened <span>that he would spare no effort to see him behind the bars. Eventually the matter was referred to the court. On being</span> cross examined by the collector he frankly repeated what he had stated at the bungalow. At this the collector enquired of Nand Ram what he had to say about the conduct of Shiv Ram. Nand Ram had to acknowledge that he knew him and that he belonged to a noble family and he must have been led astray on account of living in the company of dacoits. But he insisted that he must be punished otherwise he would again commit such a crime. The collector was a kind hearted person. He was very much influenced by his uprightness and truthfulness so, after giving him a warning for future, acquitted <span>him. Should the collector,</span><span> showing mercy that way, be </span>considered as unjust. Likewise, when a man seeks refuge in God with a truthful and upright mind, He grants him salvation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">An objection may be raised in this regard that all the instances cited here, pertain to petty offences. In a murder case even if the parties are reconciled the judge hearing the case has no discretionary power to acquit the criminal of the charge and in case he does so, he is sure to be regarded as unjust. Before an answer to this question is given, it will be proper to keep in mind that a murder or the killing of men is committed with three different motives—for a justful cause, unintentionally and intentionally in an unfair manner. The murder committed for a justful cause is hardly ever reckoned a murder as such. The murder committeddisinterestedly for the sake of safeguarding one’s supreme duties, for public welfare, for the cause of justice or for self defence is not treated as cognizable offence. The judge awarding capital punishment to the culprit for his guilt or the executer of death sentence are not regarded as criminals. The truth is that the person using weapon against a robber for the protection of his money and life is considered to be worthy of a reward. Recently a Bengali young lady killed a young man who had entered her house with an ill motive. She was arrested but the court, praising her action, acquitted her. In man-made laws, however, there is a chance, in some cases at least, of a law-abiding person to be misapprehended as a criminal deserving punishment. But there is no scope for such a mistake being committed by one who has eyes on all sides.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The second type of murder is one which is committed unintentionally. The culprit in such a murder case is certainly regarded as guilty because it is on account of his imprudence that the murder is committed but the culprit in such a case is often acquitted of the charge if he fights out his case properly or at the most is awarded a commuted punishment for want of proper pleading.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The third type of murder is one which is prompted by anger, greed or enmity and is committed intentionally. The culprit of such a murder cannot be acquitted by the court under the existing laws of the land, in case his guilt is proved.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The instances of the first one, have already been cited earlier, one may come across many more of this type. Once Heera Lal Agrawal, a tyrant, was killed by a Nepalee youth named Khadg Bahadur who was awarded light punishment for his guilt but on the appeal of the people the viceroy condoned his punishment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">An instance of the second type of murder is being given hereunder—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A young Rajput named Ram Singh who lived in a village of Rajputana was practising shooting in a forest at the foot of a hill. His friend Sajan Singh was standing nearby. As he was going to press the trigger, he noticed a man coming from the opposite direction. No sooner did he turn his hand to one side to save the man than the trigger got pressed and the bullet pierced through the heart of Sajan Singh standing nearby. He fell down with a thud. Ram Singh stood senseless. The police arrived and Ram Singh was arrested on the charge of murder. He was already shocked at the death of his friend at his hands, the criminal proceedings now added to his grief. The poor fellow was in a miserable condition. The matter came for hearing in the court. Truthfully narrating the whole event and expressing his regret Ram Singh begged for forgiveness. The magistrate enquired of the members of Sajan Singh’s family to tell him frankly if they at all doubted the intentions of Ram Singh and asked them what their opinion was about the confession of his negligence. They said—‘We too, believe as he has stated that he had hardly any intention of killing Sajan Singh. Moreover, he was on friendly terms with Sajan Singh. We were also present at the spot at the time. But since Sajan Singh lost his life on account of Ram <span>singh’s negligence he must be punished.’ The judge, being</span> convinced of his honest intention and truthfulness, giving him a warning for future, honourably acquitted him of the charge of murder. Who can dare say this judge wasunjust ? If justice and mercy can find their play simultaneously in the actions of men, what wonder if God ignoring the demand of justice, grants forgiveness to the man who surrenders himself to Him?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This reminds me of an anecdote in which an extremely pious person had to undergo punishment for a fault committed by him unintentionally. The incident is connected with the life history of emperor Dasharath by whose hands was killed Shravan Kumar who was profoundly devoted to his parents. In the context of this chronicle, questions are often raised as to how could it be taken for granted that one’s faults done unintentionally are forgiven when the fault committed unintentionally by Dasharath was not forgiven? The answer to this question, along with the historical background of the event, is as under—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One night king Dasharath went to a forest for hunting wild animals. At one place he heard a sound like that of the trumpetting of an elephant coming from the river side and shot a pointed arrow aiming at the sound. At once he heard evidently someone groan and say these words—‘Who has struck an innocent ascetic like me without any <span>faul</span><span>t</span><span>? What harm have I done to be killed in this manne</span><span>r</span>? Who will attend on my aged parents now ? Who will feed them and offer them water to drink?’ Hearing these pathetic words Dasharath was deeply shocked at heart. In a state of confusion when he rushed to the river bank he found an ascetic with long matted hair, lying on the ground soaked in blood. When Dasharath begged forgiveness the sage said—‘My blind parents are thirsty; I came here to fetch water for them when you shot an arrow at the sound produced by filling the pitcher with water. My parents will be waiting for me. Go to them and tell them what has happened. Try to appease them lest they should curse you. Pull out the arrow from my body for I am feeling acute pain. The great sin of killing a Brahman will not be ascribed to you for my name is Shravan Kumar and I am a Vaishya by caste.’ Then Dasharathji pulled out the arrow struck into his body and no sooner did he pull out the arrow than Shravan lay dead. The king approached Shravan’s parents with water. They were waiting for their son’s arrival. As soon as they heard the footsteps they enquired of the comer the reason for the delay. Telling them his name and address very humbly Dasharath narrated to them the whole story and prayed to them to drink water. The old couple fainted for a while but when they were restored to sense they proceeded saying thus—‘O King, had you not approached us personally to inform us about your evil deed your head would have been torn into thousand pieces. You did the evil deed unintentionally otherwise the whole of the Raghu race would have utterly been ruined. Now lead us to where our son lies.’ Dasharath led the two to that place. Soon after touching the dead body they fell to the ground and started lamenting very pathetically. While dying the sorrowing sage said—‘Dasharath, as I am dying now on account of my son’s bereavement, so shall you too, die on account of your son’s bereavement.’ Saying so they also departed to the other world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Afterwards the king performed a sacrifice in consequence of which the king begot four sons—Ram, Lakshman, Bharat and Shatrughn. Shri Ram was later exiled and this separation from his son caused the death of the king. This chronicle is contained in the Ramayan composed by Valmiki (please consult 2. 63). This bears out the fact that the king did get punishment but it was quite inconsiderable. His sons departed to the forest but were not separated for ever, as it was in the case of Shravan. In my humble opinion if Dasharath had taken greater pains, even this much of punishment would have been waived off. Noticing the king’s grave concern, Shravan had on his part forgiven the king and directed him to his parents to console them. Likewise, if the favour of Shravan’s parents also could have been gained, Dasharath would have succeeded in seeking their forgiveness also. His gains were only in proportion to his efforts. Making effort to obtain forgiveness is verily a kind of atonement. Could it be that king Dasharath had offered special prayer, God willing, he would have inspired Shravan’s parents with piety and compassion and make them forgive him. Could it be so, the blamelessness of the divine justice would have been proved beyond all doubts. The truth is that whatever sin a man commits, man can attain forgiveness for the same without undergoing the punishment for it by taking refuge in God and making proper atonement for it. Not only by undergoing punishment but also by making atonement and resorting to such other means, redemption of sins can be sought, for atonement is also a way of suffering the consequence of one’s sins.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So far as the third type of murder, committed with evil intentions, is concerned, the present legal set up does not, however, admit of allowance of mercy and as such no instance of this type can be cited to bring home to the readers the true aspect of divine compassion, but everyone will have to acknowledge this much that the aim of a king, truly justful and having the welfare of his subjects at heart, in framing penal laws as well as in making provisions for punishment to the wrong-doers in accordance with it, is to show mercy to the offenders. By awarding punishment to the offenders a just ruler aims at educating the offenders and bringing about a reform in them; he does not aim at persecuting someone out of envy or putting an end to one’s life without substantial ground. An intentional murder is committed by one who is instigated by enmity and vindictiveness. Notwithstanding all that, a just king can never be a match for the Lord. The divine law is fully inspired with compassion, friendliness and common good. We cannot even imagine of it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The divine decrees are a sort of taxation. The administration of the divine law ultimately aims at the well-being of both the complainant and the offender and this is its remarkable feature. According to the sacred ordinances of the supremely compassionate Lord, the sinner who making a confession of his sins with a pure heart takes a vow never to commit the sin in future and taking refuge in the Lord, makes a total self-surrender at His revered feet with a pure mind and gladly accepts His strictest biddings, His severest ordinances and each of His decrees; and regards them to be His rewards, moreover, instead of imploring for forgiveness of his sins, takes pleasure in undergoing the punishment awarded to him—to such a devotee taking refuge in God and making total self-surrender to Him with an upright mind, besides exonarating him from all his sins, the Lord grants riddance from all fears. This upholds the truth that the compassionate Lord is just. To save a devotee, having such motive from undergoing any sort of punishment, is the just and merciful rule of the kingdom of God. That is why mercy and justice co-exist in God. In the Gita the Lord firmly declares—</p>
