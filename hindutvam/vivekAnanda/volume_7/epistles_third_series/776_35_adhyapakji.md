63 ST. GEORGE'S ROAD,  
LONDON, S.W.  
*16th May, 1896*.

DEAR ADHYAPAKJI, (Prof. John Henry Wright. The letter was written on the
death of his daughter, aged 16.)

Last mail brought the very very sad news of the blow that has fallen on
you.

This is the world my brother — this illusion of Mâyâ — the Lord alone is
true. The forms are evanescent; but the spirit, being in the Lord and of
the Lord, is immortal and omnipresent. All that we ever had are round us
this minute, for the spirit can neither come nor go, it only changes its
plane of manifestation.

You are strong and pure and so is Mrs. Wright, and I am sure that the
Divine in you has arisen and thrown away the lie and delusion that there
can be death for anyone.

"He who sees in this world of manifoldness that one support of
everything, in the midst of a world of unconsciousness that one eternal
consciousness, in this evanescent world that one eternal and
unchangeable, unto him belongs eternal peace."

May the peace of the Lord descend upon you and yours in abundance is the
prayer of 

Your ever loving friend,

VIVEKANANDA.
