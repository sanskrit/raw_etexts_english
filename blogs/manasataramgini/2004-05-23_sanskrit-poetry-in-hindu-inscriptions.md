Dr. BC Chabra provides several examples of exemplary Sanskrit poetry in
Hindu inscriptions. I shall provide a few of these as illustrations:

श्री चन्द्रगुप्तस्य महेन्द्र कल्पः कुमारगुप्तस्तनयः समग्राम् |   
ररक्ष साध्वीम् इव धर्मपत्नीं वीर्याग्रहस्तैर् उपगुह्य भूमिं ||

The verse is in the triShTubh meter with 44 syllables 4\*11.

“kumAragupta the son of the illustrious chandragupta, endowed like the
great indra, protected the land even as his wedded wife embraced in his
valiant hands.”

upaguhya – embracing (could also mean hiding/covering/spanning)

कुर्वन्तु कीर्तन शतानि रणाङ्गणेषु मथ्नन्तु वैरिनिकरं धनम् उत्सृजन्तु ।  
कालान्तरे तद् अखिलं प्रबलान्धकार नृत्योपमं कविजनैर् अनिबध्यमानम् ॥

They may perform hundreds of famous acts, on the battle-fields they may
churn the enemy masses, they may donate wealth,  
but with the passage of time all these deeds will be like a dance
performed in overpowering darkness;  
unless they are limitlessly praised by the poet-folks.

This is from the Koni (near Khutaghat Dam, Ratanpur, Chhattisgarh) stone
inscription from circa 1148-49 CE during the reign of king pR^ithivideva
of the ratnapura kalachuri clan. The author kAshala was the quintessence
of the erudite kShatriya before the horror years of Indian history. He
declares himself as being a warrior, poet, veterinary physician of
elephants and philosopher. Ironically nothing is known of him but for
this inscription- in a sense he was a poet immortalizing himself.

The meter here is an unusual meter of classical Sanskrit called the
vasantatilaka meter, which is typified by 14+14+14+14 syllabic pattern
in the verse.

raNA\~ngaNeShu=on the battle fields; mathnantu= to churn \[imperative
3rd person plural\]; vairi-nikaraM=enemy masses. This is a common usage
sanskrit accounts of battle, and is also encountered in tamil. It is
good example of how a pan-Indian phraseology that spread to local
languages in the classical period.

dhanam utsR^ijantu: This phrase may have a double-meaning on purpose- 1)
meaning those who become famous by donating wealth or 2) those who
become famous by renouncing their wealth. utsR^ijati may be interpreted
as renouncing wealth.
