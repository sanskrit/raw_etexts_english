There are certain strange events or what they call the déjà vu that give
you an eerie feeling. In course of a conversation on the transmission of
tAntrika lineages between different parts of bhAratavarSha with R, she
was mentioning the links on her maternal side that she had dug up
recently. The connection to my medieval coethnic samarapu\~Ngava
dIkShita and its symmetry with respect to my larger clan was rather
surprising. So it may not be out of place to discuss this great clan of
mantravAdin-s among my coethnics. A genealogy up to certain point of the
northern branch was produced by the historian madhava-kR^iShNa-sharman.
Unfortunately, at this stage I cannot produce a complete genealogy of
the southern branch.

In the drAviDa country on the bank of the Pennar river in the
Paanampalli village, south of Shivakanchi, in an agrahAraM associated
with the hastigirinAtha temple, lived a family of notable shrauta
ritualists and saMskR^ita authors. They belonged to the Atreya gotra of
vipra shyAvAshva and were chaturvedin-s. Their family deity was the
viShNu standing atop the seven hills. One of the foremost amongst them
was the ritualist samarapu\~Ngava dIkShita who had performed multiple
soma yAga-s and written a few works. His son was tirumala, and his son
was shrIniketana dIkShita were also somayAjin-s. The latter’s son was
shrInivAsa dIkShita, who after performing several somayAga-s in the
drAviDa country had also acquired some knowledge of tAntrika lore. He
then headed to the northern country and reached the jAlandhara pITha
around 1575 CE even as the Mogol tyrant Akbar was prosecuting his bloody
Jihad in Rajasthan. In the central part of the country rAnI durgAvatI
and her son vIra-nArAyaNa had been killed after a heroic struggle
against the Moslems and the last great patrons of the saiddhAntika
shaiva-s had come to an end with that. The bundela-s were still
defending the Hindu banner from their forest outpost at Orcha locked in
a death-struggle with the army of Islam. But even in these trying times
Hindus boldly moved from one part of bhArata to another as a part of
their tIrtha circuits. The main driving force for shrInivAsa was to
visit jAlandhara pItha as it was one of the greatest tAntrika kShetra-s
after the oDDiyAna pITha, which had already been lost to the turuShka-s.

There he encountered a powerful tAntrika from the pa\~nchanada named
AchArya sundara deshikendra who was a learned exponent of the kula path.
After having mastered a vast body of tantric mantra-s shrInivAsa was
finally given dIkSha in the kAdi shrIvidyA and the trika mantra-s by
sundara deshikendra under the dIkSha name vidyAnandanAtha. Giving
shrInivAsa a shrIchakra he asked him to settle in vArANasI and expound
the tantra-s of the kAmeshvarI. While vArANasI was reeling under the
charge of the turuShka-s, sundara is supposed to have predicted that it
will be revived by the time shrInivAsa reached the city. Indeed
remarkable events were unfolding in the background. The Mogol tyrant was
undergoing a remarkable transformation \[read about it as detailed by
[shrI sarvesha tivArI](http://bharatendu.com/)\] and he had elevated the
Hindu toDaramalla to handle the finances of his Ulus. The city that
toDaramalla bestowed his attention was vArANsI, which he renovated and
made the center of his scheme of reviving Hindu scholarship. He
attracted numerous learned brAhmaNa-s to the city to participate in the
production of an enormous medical and chemical encyclopedia among
others. Having reached the city in 1581 CE, shrInivAsa wrote a
definitive commentary on the hallowed nityAShoDashikArNava named the
artharatnAvalI. He also composed a mantra manual on the worship of shiva
titled the shivArchana-chandrika.

His son named jagannivAsa was sought by rAma shAha, the rAjpUt ruler of
Chanderi. rAma shAha was the son of madhukara shAha and had fought the
Moslems in many battles before finally seizing Chanderi after defeating
the forces of the Mogol tyrant Akbar, which were lead by the Jihadis Ali
Quli Khan and Jam Quli Khan. rAma shAha appointed the young jagannivAsa
as his preceptor and tutor for the clan. But shortly thereafter an
internecine fight broke out in the bundela clan – vIrasiMha the other
son of madhukara shAha killed Abu Fazl who had been sent to conquer
Bundelkand by Akbar and strengthened himself in the old bundela capital
of Orcha. This resulted in a conflict between rAma shAha and vIra sIMha,
when Jahangir interceded and had rAma shAha captured and imprisoned in
Delhi. At this time jagannivAsa moved with rAma shAha’s grandson bhArata
shAha. In 1608 rAma shAha and Jahangir signed a truce in return for the
former giving the latter troops. Upon his release rAma shAha moved to
the province of Bar where he declared himself rAjan. Subsequently, in
1612 the warlike bhArata shAha succeeded rAma shAha. In 1616 he moved on
Chanderi and captured it to found the second bundela dynasty. Here
jagannivAsa helped with designing new forts which were built in
Talbehat, Haraspur and Golakot the ruins of all of which are in the
vicinity of Gwalior and some irrigation works. Additionally, jagannivAsa
also helped in training bhArata shAha’s son devI siMha along with his
own sons shivAnanda, janArdana and chakrapANi. This devI siMha then
studied along with shivAnanda as both of them shared great interest in a
wide range of topics such as medicine, astronomy, saMskR^ita literature,
tantra-s and dharmashAstra-s. When devI siMha ascended the throne of
Chanderi at the young age of 16, he and shivAnanda started indulging
extensively in their intellectual pursuits. The rAjan was initiated into
kAdi shrIvidyA by shivAnanda.

Under the patronage of devI siMha, shivAnanda started composing a
variety of which include:  
1\) vaidyaratnA: A work on Ayurveda with an auto-commentary.  
2\) tithi-nirNaya, bAlaviveka and mUhUrta-ratna: works on time-keeping  
3\) vyavahAra-nirNaya and AchAra-sindhu: dharma-shAstra works  
4\) saMpkShepa-prAyashchitta: a work on penances and atonements.  
5\) mahAbhArata subhAShita saMgraha: didactic material from the
mahAbhArata.  
6\) kArakakosha, taddhita kosha, samAsa kosha, strI-pratyaya kosha and
sImha siddhAnta dIpikA: all grammatical works  
7\) several stotra-s to various deities including an encoded shrIkula
tAntrika stotra titled the tripurA stotra.  
8\) mahAvidyAlaharI: A tAntrika poetic collection.  
Under his guidance his patron devI siMha also wrote a medico-tAntric
volume titled the siMha-siddhAnta-sudhAnidhi.  
9\) Finally he composed his magnum opus the siMha-siddhAnta-sindhu. This
is beyond doubt the greatest tantric compendium ever composed in the
medieval period and illustrates the enormous scholarship of this great
brAhmaNa. The work is definitely more comprehensive than the shArada
tilaka, prapa\~nchasAra, shrIvidyArNava, mantra-mahodadhi,
mantra-prakAsha, prapa\~nchasAra-saMgraha, bR^ihat-tantra-sAra and
purashcharyArNava. It is the true course to be followed by a high-level
smArta tantric ritualist – in 92 taraMga-s spanning 35310 sholka-s. It
covers pA\~ncharAtra as well as shaiva mantra-shAstra and aims to cover
all manner of mantra-s. Of the texts he quotes some apparently lost
texts are of interest:  
\*guha-kalpa: kaumAra rituals; \*rituals of the parishiShTha-s of the
Chandoga-s; \*sautramaNi-tantra; \*ShaDanvaya mahAratna: a trika-kaula
work; \*lakShmIkulArNava: a shrIkula text with vaiShNava orientation; \*
A R^igvedic parishiShTha of the bahvR^icha-s.

His citations show his encyclopedic knowledge of siddhAnta tantra-s
including some archaic ones like nishvAsa saMhitA (pAshupata elements of
it), kAlottara, pi\~NgalAmata and mohachUDottara. It is also clear that
he had access to the pichumata (i.e. the real brahma-yAmala rather than
the text followed by the paNTAram-s of the Tamil country),
viShNu-yAmala, devI-yAmala, bhairava-yAmala and jayadratha yAmala texts.
He also shows knowledge of the Kashmirian hAdividyA based shrIchakra
ritual manual termed the lalitArchana-chandrikA. Another text of
interest that he cites in the context of the kapAlavrata is the
somasiddhAnta. It is believed that such a kApAlika text might still be
extant in vArANasI through the grape-vine and manuscript catalogs but I
have no confirmation for this. He also repeatedly cites a tantra called
the mAlinIvijaya, but from the citation it is clear that what is meant
is that more precisely called the mAlinIvijayottara. An unreferenced
mention of seven crore vidyA-s and mantra-s (I guess) might be derived
from the tantra-sadbhAva, but then some other tantra could also mention
this figure. One of the kaula texts cited by him is the tantra termed
kulamUlAvatara which is cited by various authors from the
va\~Nga/kali\~Nga, drAviDa and kAshI suggesting that it was a popular
text. The haMsapArameshvara cited by shivAnanda is enigmatic. Based on
citations by the Kashmirian pA\~ncharAtrika-s people have claimed that
it is a vaiShNava tantra. However, it is cited on multiple occasions by
shaiva authorities in the Kashmirian world and shivAnanda’s context
favors a shaiva interpretation. So it is not clear if there were
different haMsapArameshvara-s of both the shaiva and vaiShNava variety.

His vaiShNava tantra citations include the hayashIrSha saMhitA showing
that this text was indeed more widely distributed than many people have
thought. Interestingly his nR^isiMha kalpa appears to have been likely
the overlapping or similar to the nR^isiMha section of the “A\~ngirasa”
kalpa of the atharvan-s from the kalI\~Nga country.

As the Mogol invasion of Bundelkhand progressed shivAnanda moved to the
court of anUpa-siMha of Bikaner along with his brother janArdana and
their sons. This anUpa siMha, who was a great collector and preserver of
manuscripts, gave them the grant of two villages and settled them there.
But shivAnanda’s son shrIniketana settled in court of the rAja of
Jaipur, the astronomer. When in Bikaner we find that shivAnanda composed
two shrIvidyA manuals titled:  
10\) lalitArchana-kaumudi  
11\) lalitArchana-dIpikA  
12\) A manual of kArtavIrya and dAttAtreya prayoga-s known as the
kArtavIrya-vidhi-ratna.  
13\) saparyAkramadarpaNa-stotra of unknown contents.  
His brother janArdana composed:  
1\) A worship manual for the lay votary in Hindi for the worship of
viShNu and lakShmI: the lakshMInArAyaN-pujA-sAr.  
2\) An erotic work titled the shR^i\~NgAra shataka.  
3\) His own mantra-shAstra manual though shorter than that of his
brother’s titled the mantra-chandrikA.  
4\) mahAlakshMI-stutI.  
The last notable scholar in this North Indian branch of the clan that I
have been able to trace is narasiMha-lAl who composed:  
1\) A mantra manual for durgA worship: durgArchana paddhati  
2\) A nitya-naimittika karma manual  
3\) sundarI-gopAla paddhatI on the syncretic shrIvidyA combined with the
gopi-jana-vallabha mantra system of the late pA\~ncharAtrika-s.  
Other works by this illustrious clan of tAntrika-s like one on
construction of an astrolabe by bhairavanAtha, TIkA-s on parAshara’s
astronomy and the yantramAlikA by paramasukha are found scattered over
North India.
