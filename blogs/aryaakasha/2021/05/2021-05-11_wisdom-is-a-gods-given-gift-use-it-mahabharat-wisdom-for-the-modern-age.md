A maxim from the Mahabharat that somebody had posted, in response to the
rather obvious question of why devotees attending the Kumbh Mela had not
emerged unscathed from the Covid-19 community superspreading there:

न देवा दण्डमादाय रक्षन्ति पशुपालवत् ।  
यं हि रक्षितुमिच्छन्ति बुद्ध्या संयोजयन्ति तम्॥

“Gods do not brandish a cane,  
Minding men like sheep  
They bless with some wisdom sane  
Whom they wish to keep”

\[the Ganguli translation instead phrases it rather less poetically as –

“The gods do not protect men, taking up clubs in their hands after the
manner of herdsmen; unto those, however, they wish to protect, they
grant intelligence.”\]

\[in case it is wondered what the actual source for this is – it is Book
5 \[Udyoga Parva\], section 35, line 51\]

Now this is not, of course, entirely true – there are most definitely
cases of the miraculous Divine Interventions wherein subtly or with
flashy pyrotechnics and fulminating Voice of Thunder, the pious devotee
has been quite directly protected from harm .. or, for that matter,
guided directly to do the right and the righteous thing .

I have no doubt of that. I have directly witnessed it to occur, and been
quite the grateful beneficiary thereof.

Yet I nevertheless do think that that Mahabharat-sourced maxim is quite
a useful one for our current times and the circumstances prevalent
especially in countries other than the one I am lucky enough to be
sitting here writing this within.

A properly pious devotee does not do deliberately and \*unnecessarily\*
risk-laden things simply because he or she feels confident that their
zeal shall see them protected from consequence. That is foolhardiness
and likely to embroil not only the devotee but also others around them
in unnecessary perilous circumstance. It may similarly elicit the
unnecessary expenditure of resources and effort to get them back out of
it again.

Rather – a properly pious devotee respects their value … and makes
astute use of the Gods-given qualities which they have been invested
with, in pursuit of the necessary enduring victory.

Which, of course, is not to be taken as a statement against the
undertaking of \*necessary\* risks, hardship and perils – quite the
contrary. A properly pious devotee may bear these with both bravery and
understanding, and takes them as tangible acts of Will.

However, precisely inherent in that quality of ‘wisdom’ imparted to the
devotee (and the Sanskrit term used in the verse is ‘Buddhi’ – which we
might translate also as ‘awareness’, ‘sagacity’) is some measure of
discernment as to just which is which.

Which circumstances are ‘unnecessary’ risks versus ‘necessary’ ones.

It is easy to lose sight of this distinction, especially when passions
are swept up and fervor spreads with fever-pitch.

That would be a mistake – for while it is true that Faith is Bricks … it
is \*Knowledge\* and \*Wisdom\* which are the Mortar.

And as applies the contemporary circumstances – the needless waste of
pious life is held out in the Shruti Itself to be just exactly that: not
a pious action in and of itself, but as Devi Vak Herself puts it: it
“does not make for the heavenly world” \[variant translation: “\[it is
not\] conducive to the world”\].
