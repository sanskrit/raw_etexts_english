THE MATH,  
*15th May, 1901*.

MY DEAR SWARUP (ÂNANDA),

Your letter from Naini Tal is quite exciting. I have just returned from
my tour through East Bengal and Assam. As usual I am quite tired and
broken down.

If some real good comes out of a visit to H. H. of Baroda I am ready to
come over, otherwise I don't want to undergo the expense and exertion of
the long journey. Think it well over and make inquiries, and write me if
you still think it would be best for the Cause for me to come to see H.
H. . . .

Yours with love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
