I just decided to record this note even though I did not complete the
earlier one on the PBU. Upon reading my note on the PBU (as it currently
stands), ekanetra made an inquiry regarding the atharvashiras
upaniShad(ASU), which alludes to the ancient pAshupata vrata. ekanetra
correctly noticed that at the heart of the ASU is the R^ik on which the
bR^ihat sAman is composed. He wondered if this might have a connection
with the sAman-s songs recited by the kApAlika-s as per the testimony of
the sarva-siddhAnta viveka. Currently two versions of this famous
pAshupata upaniShad are known, namely one preserved by the medieval
commentator nArAyaNa and another by the commentator sha\~NkarAnanda. But
there is third version that has been much ignored. This is the version
found in sections 2.17-18 of the li\~Nga purANaM. This provides
evidence, independent of these medieval commentators, that this
upaniShad was indeed prevalent amongst the pAshupata-s. This paurANika
version also preserves the R^igvedic mantra on which the bR^ihat is
sung, suggesting that it was an integral part of the original mAheshvara
system of the atharvashiras.
