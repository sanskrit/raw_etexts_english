## XXI [1](#fn1)

(*Translated from [Bengali](b6030e6021.pdf)* )

GHAZIPUR,  
*14th Feb., 1890.*

DEAR SIR,

In my note of yesterday I perhaps forgot to ask you to return brother
Sharat's letter. Please send it. I have heard from brother Gangadhar. He
is now in Rambag Samadhi, Srinagar, Kashmir. I am greatly suffering from
lumbago.

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Rakhal and Subodh have come to Vrindaban after visiting Omkar,
Girnar, Abu, Bombay, and Dwarka.

1.  [^](#txt1)Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,
    xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written
    to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose
    profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These
    letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a
    time when, after his Master's passing away, Swamiji was leading a
    wandering monk's life. In the early days he used to sign his name as
    Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in
    all these pages for easy comprehension.
