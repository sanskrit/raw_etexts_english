## CIX

*To Lala Badri Sah of Almora*

DARJEELING

*7th April '97*.

DEAR LALAJEE,

Just received your kind invitation through telegram. Perhaps you have
already heard that I have been attacked by "Diabetes", a fell disease.

That unsettled all our plans, and I had to run up to Darjeeling, it
being very cool and very good for the disease.

I have felt much better since, and the doctors therefore do not want me
to move about, as that brings about a relapse. If my present state of
health continues for a month or two, I think I will be in a condition to
come down to the plains and come to Almora to see you all. I am very
sorry that I have caused you a good deal of trouble, but you see it
could not be helped — the body was not under my control.

With all love to yourself and other friends in Almora.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA
