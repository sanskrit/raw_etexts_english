(Note:This is not against the Swacch Bharat program or against
technologies for public sanitation,etc)

By reducing the component of cleanliness to only just toilets,clean
public,etc,one is likely to miss out the other dimensions of śuci.

Just what does this term śauca mean?

śauca means purity at not just the individual level,but at a particular
environment and communal and familial level.It is not just physical
purity(avoidance of bacteria),but of the surroundings,the body,the
sukṣma dēha and the general atmosphere around.

And this is not really separable from our deities(that śloka *apavitraḥ
pavitrō vāsarvāvasthāṃ gatō’pi vā । yaḥ smarētpuṇḍarīkākṣaṃ sa
bāhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ ॥* comes to my mind). And it does make sense.
Purity and the deva,who is the very embodiment of an āgāmika(deva
specific or smārta) temple,are inseparable. It is only with keeping
Nārāyaṇa at the centre,as noted in that verse,does one realize the
fullest import of what śuci means,and not through secularized
stuff,which runs contrary to Hindu frameworks and ideologies).
