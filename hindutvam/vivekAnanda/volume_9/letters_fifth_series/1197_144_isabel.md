## CXLIV

*To Miss Isabelle McKindley*

RIDGELY MANOR  
STONE RIDGE, N.Y.

*31st August '99*

MY DEAR ISABEL —

Many thanks for your kind note. I will be so, so glad to see you. Miss
M'cLeod \[MacLeod\] is going to write you to stop a day and a night here
on your way to the West.

My love to the holy family in Chicago, and hope surely to be able to
come West and have great fun.

So you are in Greenacre at last. Is this the first year you have been
there? How do you like the place? \[You have\] seen Miss Farmer, of
course. Kindly convey her my kindest regards and to all the rest of my
friends there.

Ever yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA
