## CXCIV

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH DIST., BENGAL,  
\[*April 4, 1901*\]

DEAR CHRISTINE,

The subsequent proceedings have been so much interesting; and the
interest has been growing so rapidly of late, that one could scarcely
utter a word.[1](#fn1)

I am glad to learn of Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull's sweet letter to you; she is an
angel. You are peaceful and happy — good. I am growing towards it too.

I am en route to Chandranath on pilgrimage.

I have been anxiously awaiting a letter from you, and it seemed it would
never come.

 

I am sure to be happy — can't help thinking so. After so much struggle,
the result must come. Things take their own course; it is I who am to
brighten up, I find. And I am trying my best. And you can help me by
writing nice letters now and then; will you?

Margot \[Sister Nivedita\] is doing splendid work in England with Mrs.
Bull's backing. Things are going on nicely.

I am sleeping better and the general health is not bad.

With everlasting love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.

P.S. Please enquire of Miss \[Sarah Ellen\] Waldo about the publication
of *Karma* and *Jnâna Yogas* and write.

1.  [^](#fn1_1)As there was no known communication between Swami
    Vivekananda and Christine during the first quarter of 1901, perhaps
    the Swami was referring to the fact that he was then on pilgrimage
    to East Bengal, with a large party, and was too busy to write to
    anyone during this period.
