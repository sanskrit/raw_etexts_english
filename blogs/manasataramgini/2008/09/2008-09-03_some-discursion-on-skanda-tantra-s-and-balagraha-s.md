Over the years we have been collecting several observations on the
kaumAra sect, its texts and evolution on this site. While all this would
be worth synthesizing, that would need much greater effort. We identify
3 basic phases in the development of mantra-mArga kaumAra shAsana: 1)
The earliest phase appearing in the late vedic period characterized by
the celebrated nejameSha mantra of the R^igveda khila, the skanda yAga
and dhUrta-bali of the AV and YV traditions, and the ShaShThI sUkta of
the maitrAyaNIya tradition. 2) The middle phase comprising of the origin
of the early tantric system of the kaumAra shAsana and its development
through the gupta period and beyond. This is an extended phase with
texts like the ShaNmukha kalpa at the earlier end, skanda-sadbhAva in
the middle and subrahmaNya kalpa in the later end. 3) The symbiosis with
the Urdhvasrotas of the shaiva shAsana, a phase which was mainly
prevalent in South India. We have evidence and reasons to believe that
the phase 2 of the evolution of mantra-mArga kaumAra shAsana had
considerable role in fertilizing or providing seeds for the development
of several other streams, such as the shaiva shAsana and the tAntrIka
stream in the nAstIka realm. In this context three main points of
interest emerge:  
1\) The absorption and integration of the early kaumAra elements into:
1.1) bhUta tantras of the shaiva realm, 1.2) the system of deities in
kaula streams like those of the pashchimAMnAya and 1.3) the vaiShNava
pA\~ncharAtra tantra-s as the deity viShvaksena.  
2\) The absorption of kaumAra elements into the bauddha shAsana (we had
earlier given a brief illustration of this using the mantra-s and
maNDala-s of the ma\~njushrI mUla kalpa). This parallels the earlier
absorption of kumAra as the bauddha “missionary” amongst the deva-s
beginning from the janavasabha sutta of the dIghanikhAya of the Pali
canon. Of particular interest in the current context is also the early
development of the deity vajrakumAra in the nAstIka realm. His original
association appears to be with the mahAyoga tantra-s of the bauddha-s,
but he seems to have been marginalized with the ascendancy of the
yogottara and yoginI-tantra-s amongst them. We have some evidence that
Indian mantravAdin-s translated his prayoga-s into chIna-bhAShA in the
early 700s of CE and these were extensively used in abhichAra-s of the
nAstIka-s. One such text the vajrakumAra tantra in Chinese translation
of the original Sanskrit is of great importance. This Chinese text in
many places even fails to add the ‘vajra-‘ prefix and simply calls him
kumAra and uses derivative of kaumAra mantra-s. A critical rite is
prescribed on a day in the kArttika mAsa to vajrakumAra just as in the
case of kumAra. vajrakumAra’s AvaraNa devata-s include a notable
collection of pishAchI-s who are avicephalous or therocephalous just
like the skandamAtR^i-s in the AvaraNa of kArttikeya. One of the
attendants of vajrakumAra is a roguish devI called rematI who sits a
seat of a flayed skin of a child and is the ruler of the diseases of
children. Thus, she is an ortholog of the revatI of the kaumAra
tantra-s. The shakti of vajrakumAra is dIptachakrA-devI who is very
similar in all features to devasenA. Interestingly, vajrakumAra is
called the great son and the japa mAlA used in his rite is made of
rudrAkSha-s with 6 faces. Thus, it is very clear that the bauddha
vajrakumAra tantra-s, like key parts of the ma\~njushrI mUla kalpa arose
as adaptations of kaumAra works, even as the yoginI tantra-s of the
nAstIka-s are derived from their shaiva counterparts. Likewise the early
development of the deity mahAmAyUrI also appears to have been fertilized
by kaumAra elements pertaining to his shakti ShaShThI.

3\) The kaumAra shAsana’s development from the beginning was closely
linked to pediatrics in traditional hindu medicine. The link to
childbirth and diseases of children is seen in the late vedic layer.
E.g.: 1) the nejameSha mantra of the RV khila (child birth); 2) the
formulae for relief from kumAra graha-s in pAraskAra gR^ihyasUtra
(1.16.24); It continues in the mahAbhArata: 3) The extensive discussion
of kumAra graha-s in the vana parvan narrative of the skandopAkhyAna
(Vulgate 3.229); 4) skanda- graha-s and mAtR^i-s in the shalya parvan
(Vulgate 7.44-46); finally we also see an inheritance of these elements
by the nAstIka-s followers of the nirgrantha in the tale of his
nativity: 5) jaina kalpasUtra (2.22 onwards). Here, the nirgrantha’s
followers, in a typical anti-brahminical rant, state how originally the
nirgrantha was an embryo in the womb of his biological mother devAnandA,
a brAhmaNa woman of the jAlandharAyaNa gotra. But because nirgrantha
tIrthaMkara-s are never born in brahminical wombs indra, but in
ikShvAku, yAdava or at least a rich kShatriya families, indra summoned
hariNegameShin, the commander-in-chief of the deva armies, and asked him
to transfer the embryo of the nagna to a kShatriya womb. The commander
of the gods flew to bhArata-varSha like a comet and on the 83rd day
after conception extracted the embryo out of devAnandA’s womb when the
moon was in uttara-phalguni. He then removed the “brahminical atoms” of
he embryo and replaced them with “clean atoms” he had collected on the
way. Then he transferred the embryo of the future vardhamAna to the womb
of his surrogate mother trishalA a kShatriya (See picture above). He
then took the embryo in her womb and placed in that of devAnandA and
flying thousands of yojana-s in each leap he reached indra’s abode to
inform him of the successful transfer. The jaina neminAtha charita (NC
7) provides a comparable narrative of how harinaigameShin gave kR^iShNa
a son via satyabhAmA upon his extensive propitiation.

These jaina narratives strikingly parallel the implication of nejameSha
mantra-s of the RV-khila and their associated rituals in different vedic
traditions:

*nejameSha parA pata suputraH punar A pata |  
asyai me putrakAmAyai garbham A dhehI yaH pumAn ||  
yathA iyam pR^ithivI mahyy uttAnA garbham Adadhe |  
evam tam garbham Adhehi dashame mAsi sUtave ||  
viSNosh shraiSThyena rUpeNa asyAm nAryAm gavInyAm |  
pumAmsam putram Adhehi dashame mAsi sUtave ||*  
O nejameSha fly away and fly back bringing a good son to my wife here,
who desires a son, give an embryo, a male one.  
Just as the wide earth stretched out conceives the embryo, so give that
embryo that is born in the tenth month.  
Place a male child, with viShNu’s great form, to be born in the tenth
month into the womb of this woman.

In R^igvedic tradition (AshvalAyana and shAkhAyana) they are used in the
rite of simnatonnayana. In the taittirIyaka tradition of the yajur veda
they are deployed by the male before having sex with his wife if they
desire a son (Apastamba gR^ihya 8.13). In the maitrAyaNIya and kaTha
traditions of the yajurveda these mantra-s are deployed in the putrakAma
rites. If a man desires a son then for a whole year he performs the
ShaDAhutaM or the 6 fold oblations to nejameSha at the beginning of each
lunar pakSha using these mantra-s and 6 ghee oblations. If this fails,
then he performs the rite of the naijameSha sthAlIpAka by making a
sthAlIpAka and offering it to the god just as in the ShaDAhutaM ritual.

In traditional Hindu medicine pediatrics is sometimes termed k\[a\]umAra
tantra. This leads question as to whether the eponymy with the tantra-s
of the kaumAra shAsana is merely incidental or if there is a genuine
connection. A clear link to the kaumAra system is present in the
classical medical saMhitA of sushruta in the uttara tantra section.
Another major early medical work, the kAshyapa tantra, as we have shown
before, also incorporates a large amount of kaumAra material. An
examination of the uttara tantra of sushruta is of considerable interest
in this regard: chapters 27-37 of the uttara tantra are called kumAra
tantra. Chapter 27 of the uttara tantra provides an overview of the
graha-s. They are listed as: 1) skanda 2) skandApasmAra 3) shakunI 4)
revatI 5) pUtanA 6) andhapUtanA 7) shItapUtanA 8) mukhamaNDikA and 9)
naigameSha. The prescriptions for countering their effects in UT
27.18-21 are predominantly dependent on mantra-s and rituals, suggesting
a link to a tantric tradition. The subsequent chapters take this up in
greater detail: Chapter 28 deals with the seizure by skanda. In addition
to medications using different oShadhi-s, we observe that 28.8
prescribes offering of a bell and a skanda bali of a good kukkuTa. Then
having had nocturnal baths on 3 nights on the 4th there is a treatment
with rice and barley. A daily skanda homa is prescribed to be performed
by the pediatrician (28.9-14): The fire is lit using the gAyatrI and
vyAhR^iti-s and oblations are made to skanda using the following
anuShTubh mantras:  
*tapasAM tejasaM chaiva yashasaM vapuShAM tatha |  
vidhAtA yo.avyayo devaH sa te skandaH prasIdatu ||  
graha-senApatir-devo devasenApatir-vibhuH |  
devasenA-ripuharaH pAtu tvAM bhagavAN guhaH || + svAhA  
deva-devasya mahataH pAvakasya cha yaH sutaH |  
ga\~NgomA-kR^ittikAnAM cha sa te sharma prayachChatu ||+svAhA  
raktamAlyAmbaraH shrImAn rakta-chandanabhUShitaH |  
raktadivya-vapur-devaH pAtu tvAM krau\~nchasUdanaH ||+svAhA*

The chapter 29 deals with skandApasmAra and identifies this seizure with
viShAkha. Other a series of drugs a naivedyam of meat, blood and rice
offering under a banyan tree and a bath at a cross-road are recommended.
The mantra used in the ritual is given as:  
*skandApasmAra-saMj\~no yaH skandasya dayitaH sakhA |  
viShAkha-saMj\~nshcha shisho shivo.astu vikR^itAnanaH ||*  
Likewise both drugs and mantra-s are prescribed for all other seizures
in the subsequent chapters.  
E.g. mukhamaNDikA mantra:  
* ala\~NkR^itA rUpavatI subhagA kAmarUpiNI |  
goShTha-madhyAlayaratA pAtu tvAM mukhamaNDikA ||*  
The goddess is conceived as being in the middle of a cowshed, which is
incidentally the site for her for bali.  
E.g. naigameSha mantra:  
* ajAnanash-chalAkShibhrUH kAmarUpI mahAyashAH |  
bAlaM bAla-pitA devo naigameSho.abhirakShatu ||*  
His bali is made under a banyan tree on a ShaShThi day.

The concluding chapter of the kumAra tantra section of sushruta contains
the tale of kumAra saMbhavaM similar to that in the vana parvan of the
mahAbhArata to explain graha-s. They are described as being generated by
the kR^ittikA-s, umA, agni and rudra to protect the new-born kumAra in
the sharavana even though he was protected by his own tejas. There of
course seems to be an interpolation (UT 37.10) where the author tries to
reconcile the benevolent and roguish tendencies of skanda in a clumsy
way.

In charaka (shArIra sthAna, chapter 8) too we find a mantra to
kArttikeya that is whispered into the ear of the woman in the context of
protecting the child at birth:  
* kShitir-jalaM viyat-tejo vAyur-viShNuH prajApatiH |  
sagarbhAM tvAM sadA pAntu vaishalyaM cha dishantu te ||  
prasUShva tvam avikliShTamavikliShTA shubhAnane |  
kArttikeyad-dyutiM putraM kArttikeyAbhi-rakShitam |*|

But hardly any graha material or mantra-s pertaining to them is found in
charaka. In fact charaka’s chapter is paralleled to a large extent by
sushruta’s own shArIra sthAna chapter 10, where graha-s are mentioned
only in passing and a reference is made to the uttara tantra for further
details. The classics of Ayurveda do contain several invocations and
recommendations for mantra prayoga-s (much to the delight of modern
“rationalists” who are keen to show Ayurveda as rubbish). Yet, when
one scans even the uttara tantra alone for mantra prayoga-s one finds
that they are relatively low with the exception of two sections, namely
the kumAra tantra and the bhutavidyA (which is clearly related to the
bhUta tantra-s of the paschima srotas of the shaiva tantra-s). These
observations would suggest that though there was a general practice to
invoke skanda in the context of child birth (seen in the even earlier
vedic elements or charaka’s single mantra), the kumAra tantra is a
special mantra- and ritual- rich accretion to the Hindu medical
tradition.

The much latter aShTA\~Nga saMgraha of vAgbhaTa the son of simhagupta,
the last of the big three in Hindu medicine (i.e. it clearly comes after
charaka and sushruta because it recognizes several elements of
full-blown bauddha mantra-shAstra like mahAmAyUrI, AryAparNashabarI and
AryAparAjitA) also preserves similar mantra material in its kaumAra
tantra in the uttarasthAna. In fact the aShTA\~nga saMgraha provides
much more old material in this regard than the kumAra tantra of
sushruta, including certain graha-s who are not mentioned in sushruta
but definitely existed even before: for example, the shva-graha
(uttarasthAna 6.26). This kerberomorphic graha already appears in the
mantra used in the pAraskAra gR^ihya sUtra on occasion of a kumAra
affliction. While the aShTA\~Nga saMgraha has a greater proclivity
towards mantra prayoga that charaka or sushruta (for example it even
alludes to a shAstA mantra but does not give it in sUtra sthAna 3.119),
two of the most mantra-rich sections of this text are the kaumAra tantra
and bhUta vidyA sections of the uttara sthAna. The aShTA\~Nga saMgraha
not only preserves what is found in sushruta’s kumAra tantra but much
more additional old kaumAra mantra-s and rituals. We also find that such
kaumAra material independently occurs in the other ancient medical
treatise the kAshyapa tantra. All the above observations taken together,
it is less likely that this well-developed material was built up by the
kAshyapa tantra and the aShTA\~nga saMgraha from a core represented by
the sushruta saMhitA. Instead, it is likely that sushruta, KT and the
aShTA\~Nga saMgraha were drawing from a common source containing such
material. This source we believe were the texts of the early kaumAra
tantra of the kaumAra shAsana (beginning of phase 2 in the above note
evolutionary scheme for the kaumAra shAsana).

In support of this we shall in the future present an analysis of 3 texts
namely, the aShTA\~Nga saMgraha, fragments of a text that appears to be
a lost kaumAra tantra and a much later kaumAra tantra from the drAviDa
country.
