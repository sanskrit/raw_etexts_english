It is thus that Ananda-bhairava along with his shakti Ananda-bhairavI is
meditated upon and invoked in the shrI-kula system at the time of the
offering of the scents and flowers (smArta practice) or kula-dravya (old
kaula practice). The point of note here is that Ananda-bhairavI is
explicitly identified with sudhA-devI, the ambrosial goddess and offers
a clear parallel to parA of trika and its evolutes and amR^ita-shrI of
the netra-tantra system. This is an indicator of one of the primary
facets of the devI and also that of rudra in the ancestral tantrika
system. Those who are conversant with both the vaidika and tantrika
mantra-shAstra would of course recognize the even earlier precursor of
this tantrika imagery as springing from an even earlier vaidika
substratum.
