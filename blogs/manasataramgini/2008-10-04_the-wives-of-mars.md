In our earlier discussion we had argued based on structural homologies
the marut-s of the vedic system are “para-skanda”. We speculated that
kumAra himself descends from a para-vedic Indo-Iranian system, which
contained an ancestral version of the deity, who in that system was the
homolog of the marut-s of the vedic system. This para-vedic skanda was
laterally transferred to the vedic system in the late vedic period of
India. This transfer most probably occurred by an independent
Indo-Iranian invasion from the Northwest frontiers of India, prior to
the historical Iranian invasions of the Achaemenids, Sakas and
Kushana-s. By developing this line of argument further we accepted the
possible proto-Indo-European (probably excluding Hittite) origin of the
deity. In this light we are reasonably comfortable with the homology of
Mars and the Maruts: Given that the older Italic form Mars is Mavors,
their proto-IE ancestor can be accepted as \*Mawort. The only
philological problem that does bother us a little is the vR^iddhi of the
initial vowel in the Italic branch.

There are a few other interesting features that more tenuously connect
these deities and skanda in a tangled network, which we did not discuss
in our earlier exposition of this topic. One of these is the issue of
the wives of Mars. The only more archaic data in this regard comes from
the Roman author Aulus Gellius in his book Noctes Atticae (13.23.2). In
describing “deva-patni” pairs he mentions that he has collected such
pairs from the “libri sacerdotum populi Romani” (i.e. ritual texts of
the Romans) and “plerisque antiquis orationibus” (i.e. ma\~NgalAcharaNa
equivalents found in the beginnings or ends of ancient orations). Two
wives of Mars are mentioned in the phrases: Moles Martis and Nerienemque
Martis /Nerio Martis. These dual names parallel the homologous
Indo-Aryan system, where the name of the goddess is mentioned before the
god (e.g. umA-maheshvara or Italic Maia Volcani). Both these wives have
interesting etymologies: Moles means the throngs or army like senA in
saMskR^ita. She might have been synonymized or syncretized with Bellona
(meaning war) who is also later depicted as the wife or sister of Mars.
Nerio or Neriene was later identified with and syncretized with Minerva.
But her name may be derived from the PIE root \*ner, which in one
direction gives rise to forms like nara or nR^imNa in Sanskrit. It might
also mean valor in this context or warlike nature. In the Indic world
senA or devasenA the wife of skanda and the army of the gods, a term
specifically associated with the marut-s or the rudra-s might be seen as
parallels.

Finally, we may also take a look at one of the most archaic Latin chants
recited in a sacrificial ritual of Mars that has survived to date – the
Carmen Arvale. The translation of this Carmen is really not perfect
because: 1) it is in old Latin and 2) Modern White translators, cut off
from their heathen roots, miss certain nuances. It was recited by the
Arval priest – the emperor of Rome was by default an Arval priest. It
was probably during the ritual of Mars during the Ambarvalia rite in
May. In this chant, along with Mars, two other sets of deities who had
become obscure even in Roman times are invoked:  
Carmen Arvale without the triplicated or pentaplicated elements:  
*enos Lases iuvate* \[Invocation of the deities called Lares; note the
Latin verb iuvate \[=aid/support\] in the imperative form comparable to
the imperatives found in Sanskrit mantra-s\]  
*neve lue rue Marmar sins incurrere in pleoris* \[invocation of Mars\]  
* satur fu, fere Mars, limen sali, sta berber* \[The term satur fu
appear to be a functional analog of the Sanskrit act of tarpaNa; verbal
root tR^ip. Thus, it may be seen as a tarpaNa of Mars\]  
*semunis alterni advocapit conctos* \[Here the deities called the
Semones are invoked\]  
*enos Marmor iuvato* \[Mars is called for help again\]  
* triumpe\! *\[victory: the analog of the Sanskrit invocation jaya\!\]

These two sets of plural deities the Lares and Semones are troops of
gods who accompany Mars and thus appear to be cognates of the marut-s in
the plural sense. The Semones are etymological connected to fallen
seeds. This might parallel the fertilizing seed of rudra which was the
source of skanda.
