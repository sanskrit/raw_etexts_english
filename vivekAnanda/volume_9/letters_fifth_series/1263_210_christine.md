*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, P.O. BELUR, HOWRAH

*27th November 1901*.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

It is almost sure, I did not write any letter to you that week in which
\[I\] made that infamous blunder. As I wrote you two letters a few days
previously, it is not at all probable that I wrote you another. Then
Miss \[Josephine\] MacLeod \[would have\] sent the letter back. I must
have written only one letter that week to Miss MacLeod, giving her my
reasons for not going to Japan; and somehow it so happened that the hand
wrote the most familiar name on the envelope. So you need not expect any
letter of yours back from Japan, as there was none; and if there were,
you shall have it.

I am just under another spell of catarrh and asthma. Yesterday a cyclone
blew over the place, and several trees and a bit of the roof are
damaged. It is gloomy yet and cold. You know it is almost impossible to
write with the asthma on. So *au revoir* \[good-bye\].

VIVEKANANDA.
