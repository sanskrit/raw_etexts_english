title = "Australian entomofauna and arachnofauna"

+++
R and Marc had returned after long and were having a chat along with
Sharada even though we should have been doing work. After all we are
very like the Hindu kings who squandered their days in bhoga even when
the turuShka blizzard was blowing around them. We had many things to
talk-(1) The mysteries of genetic relatedness of European, Indian and
Central Asian populations and their implications for much earlier human
migrations- like the clash between H.sapiens and H.neanderthalis. (2)
The niHshvAsa-tantra and the tantric discussion of R^ichIka and
mata\~Nga (3) The synthesis of various alkaloids and the effects of DMT
and other active amines. (4) The entomofauna and arachnofauna of
Australia. R had spent an year and half studying these in the earlier
days and was well familiar with them. She had a collection of
documentaries on them some of which provide striking illustrations of
some examples touched upon by T.Eisner in his book.
