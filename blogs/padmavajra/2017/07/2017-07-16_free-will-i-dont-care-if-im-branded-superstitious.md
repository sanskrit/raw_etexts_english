There is no free will. Even in the attainment of good things or bad.

avatārāṇyanekāni hyajasya paramātmanaḥ/jīvānāṃ karmaphalado graharūpī
janārdanaḥ//

अवताराण्यनेकानि ह्यजस्य परमात्मनः\|  
जीवानां कर्मफलदो ग्रहरूपी जनार्दनः\|\|

\[Indeed,the unborn paramātmā has had many avatāras. Janārdana in the
form of grahas(graharūpī) grants the karmaphala of living beings.\]

Basically,whatever little will you have is also coloured by your past
karmas. Your svābhāva which influences how you respond to whatever
situations you get and the impressions your receive in your formative
phases –they too are a result of your prārabdha karma. What can possibly
be changed to make this better in long run is your attitude towards what
you receive and how you manage with the cards you have been dealt with.
