## CXLIX

*To Sister Christine*

RIDGELY MANOR,

*30th October 1899*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

Did you not get my last letter? I am very anxious to know how you are.
Write a line to tell me you are in very good health.

I am afraid the previous one was misdirected, so I send this c/o Mrs.
Funkey \[Funke\].

Do write soon. I am thinking of Battle Creek food.[1](#fn1) Baby insists
on that. Do you think it will do me any good? Write soon.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS — Where is this Battle Creek? Is it near Detroit? I am seriously
thinking of giving it a trial. I am not bad, but unfit for any exertion,
even for a walk. This sort of life is no good to live. I \[will\] try
Battle Creek, and if that fails, get out quick.

V.

Write me about Battle Creek.

V.

1.  [^](#fn1_1)Battle Creek is a city in Central Michigan, United
    States, famous for its Health Centre, which was known since 1876 as
    Battle Creek Sanitarium. Under the direction of John Harvey Kellogg
    (1876 – 1943), the Sanitarium experimented with health foods, which
    became the main industry of the city.
