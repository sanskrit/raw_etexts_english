<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Preface</p>
<p class="Text">The great venerable, Shri Jaydayalji Goyandka, the founder of Gita Press had been proceeding ahead on the spiritual path since his childhood, he laid down the foundation of Gita Press for the purpose of preaching the Gita. Here, there was the arrangement to make the Gita, the Ramayan and other spiritual literature available at the lowest price to the common people. He started to hold the assembly of the religious congregation under the 'Banyan tree at Swargashrama' where an atmosphere of dispassion prevails on the bank of the Ganga generally  for three to four months. He made his best efforts for the purpose of diverting the public mind towards the Lord. He remained preaching the spiritual thoughts touring about different places.</p>
<p class="Text">Such a great man thought of such a unique idea to emancipate the man at the edge of death by making him listen the Lord's name and Gitaji etc. Not only the man at the edge of death but he also who relates the Lord's name and Gitaji may be emancipated. In this way he thought of the way for the common people to enjoy the booty of the emancipation. For this purpose he established Govind Bhawan at Kolkata and Gita Press at Gorakhpur etc., the 'Param Sewa Samiti' and there he encouraged the people for the supreme service and thus, emancipated a number of people. To free a man from the cycle of rebirth and death, he made several kinds of efforts in his life time and it is his inspiration that such works are being done even today. On different occasions he gave sermons on the glory and influence of the supreme service particularly. He threw light on what treatment should be given to a diseased man on the death bed. Having collected his sermons related to the above mentioned subjects they have been included in this present book. The sensuous enjoyments and the comforts of the body are to disincline the man from the attainment of the Lord. The sensual enjoyments and the comforts of the body are in the end very painful and a great hindrance in the Lord's achievement. In the 'Kaliyuga' 'Naam-Jap' (muttering of the Lord's name) is the best means, the sermons on these subjects have also been included in this book.</p>
<p class="Text">Reverent Swami Ramsukhdasji Maharaj has been a great helper in this work of Shri Goyandkaji.</p>
<p class="Text">Some sermons by Swamiji on the efficacy of muttering of divine name and on highest service have been included in this book.</p>
<p class="Text">The sentiments of these saints may be conveyed to the readers together at a place—The efforts have been made with this point of view.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The readers should go through this book with attentive mind and should inspire their votaries to read this book. The study of this book will uplift our lives, I expect so.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Supreme Service*</p>
<p class="xfootnote"><span class="char-style-override-2">* Discourses Jyeshtha Shukla 1, Tuesday, Sambat 2001, Dt. 23.5.1944, morning, Batabriksha, Rishikesh.</span></p>
<p class="Text">On one side there is service only and the second is the supreme selfless service bestowing emancipation on the server and the served both on the other side, to give free food and clothes, to cause the physical comforts and to sacrifice body, mind-wealth for the worldly comforts in the interest of others is called service. But the supreme service is to do the highest good of the served by sacrificing one's own body-mind and wealth. To provide livelihood to a particular one is the worldly service. To help them who are devoted and dedicated in achieving the divinity, by making their reach close to the Lord is spiritual service. If anyone is on death-bed and he desires to listen to Gita that anyone should relate to him and you reached him and made him listen to the verses of Gita, this is called the supreme service. The highest holy service is when he may not need any other service for his redemption. You served one lakh of men, gave them money and medicine, fed them on one side and on the other side if you offered the supreme service to a single one only, this service of a single one is more valuable than the service of those one lakh men. You set him free from the several births in future. You protected him from the numberless births. The ocean of death is infront. The Lord has stated in the Gita—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्य सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Gita 9/2)</p>
<p class="Text">'This knowledge of (both the Nirguna and Saguna aspects of Divinity) is a sovereign science, a sovereign secret, supremely holy, most excellent directly enjoyable, attended with virtue, very easy to practice and imperishable'.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, the Lord says with promise. Doubt was created in Arjun's mind if this is the most excellent directly enjoyable, attended with virtue and very easy to practise then why is not followed by all? Then, the Lord said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अश्रद्दधानाः पुरुषा धर्मस्यास्य परन्तप। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अप्राप्य मां निवर्तन्ते मृत्युसंसारवर्त्मनि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Gita 9/3)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, people having no faith in this Dharma, failing to reach Me, continue to revolve in the path of the world of birth and death'.</p>
<p class="Text">As there is the ocean of water so is the ocean of Death. As there are uncountable particles of water so are the uncountable numbers of death in future so long as the salvation is not attained. If you could do the redemption of a single one, that is the Supreme Service. In its comparison does not stand the lifelong service of the crores of people. If you avail any such opportunity—the man to die wants that his future may not be spoiled such service must be practised. If he is the devotee of the Lord 'Shiv' he must be got worn the 'Rudraksha Mala' in his neck and he must make listen to the loud chanting of the name and the praise of the attributes of Lord 'Shiv' and if he is the devotee of Lord 'Vishnu' make him listen the name of the Lord Narayan and the chanting in the praise of His attributes, give him the basil leaf and the water of Gangaji. He should be made remember the Lord's name in the last moment of his life. Let the portrait of the Lord be placed before his eyes. There should be the picture of the Lord's before his eyes and chanting loudly of God's name should continue before him, if so it is certain that his innerself will remember the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Do your best to do the supreme service. Make prayer to the Lord. For this purpose if you have to go to hell even, accept it. That hell will also be better than heaven for you. There is a narrative prevalent—Any devotee was passing by the side of the hell, some were heard to be crying and yelling. He asked the courtiers of the Lord—'What is this'? The courtiers said—'Maharaj! This is the world of the Lord Yama; here the souls are suffering from the tortures of the Lord Yama'. Well, stop the aeroplane and lead me there near it. When he reached there the sufferers said—'We are feeling peace and pleasure by your appearance and air touching you. All the weapons of Yama are growing to be blunt; the tortures of the Lord Yama have lessened, and so, this is our prayer to you to stay here as long as it is possible. He stayed there. The courtiers said—'Maharaj! Proceed onwards'. He answered— 'It is here I will stay'. The courtiers said—'Your destination is the Vaikuntha'. He said—'Go and convey the message to the Lord that if there may be any possibility of their accomodation also then I should go there otherwise I will stay here'. Having asked it come here the courtiers went away there. And on this side when he started the congregational singing of the Lord, the Lord appeared there. He emancipated all. It should be considered the greatest luck if the opportunity favours to provide the supreme service of this type.</p>
<p class="Text">Provide the book of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita, Bhagawata,</span> and <span class="char-style-override-3">Ramayana</span> free of cost or on lower rate. Always hear or relate the narratives of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita, Ramayana,</span> and <span class="char-style-override-3">Shrimadbhagwata.</span> Preach somehow or other by any way. Invest your money, time and energy in this work and engage your mind, wealth and men in this work of God. He who publicizes the Lord among others is the greatest devotee of the Lord. The Lord says—'O Arjun! Neither there is nor will be there in future as favourite and dear to Me as he who publicizes the conversation between you and Me in the world.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">न च तस्मान्मनुष्येषु कश्चिन्मे प्रियकृत्तमः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भविता न च मे तस्मादन्यः प्रियतरो भुवि ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Gita 18/69)</p>
<p class="Text">'Among men there is none who does Me more loving service than he; nor shall anyone be dearer to Me in the entire world then he'</p>
<p class="Text">Kabir was a devotee as well as his son was also a devotee. Kabir used to say to his son that the grown up woman is like mother, the young woman like a younger sister and if she is more younger she is like daughter. </p>
<p class="Text">One day, Kabir said to his son—'Son! Now I will arrange your marriage.</p>
<p class="Text">Kamal said—'To whom will you marry me whether with mother, sister or daughter? It has been stated also</p>
<p class="SHLOK">'आधा भक्त कबीर था, पूरा भक्त कमाल।' </p>
<p class="Text">'Kabir was only half a devotee, the perfect devotee was Kamal.'</p>
<p class="Text">Raidas was the devotee of the Lord, he was Harijan by caste. His daughter was also the devotee. Someone visited Raidas's house to get the view of the Lord. Raidas said to his daughter—'Daughter! Make him drink the 'Gangajal' (water of the Ganga), he will get the sight of the Lord. She took away the water used for colouring the leather having filled it in the jug. He did not drink that water because of being used for colouring the leather; but an other devotee who had faith and love drank that water and he got the apparent sight of the Lord, he began to dance and sing. Some water had fallen down on his clothes. Squeezing that cloth in the water the people began to drink that water, whosoever drank it got the view of the Lord. Later on that devotee came to realize his mistake and went to Raidas again. Raidas said—'That water went away to 'Multan' (the place now is in Pakistan)  now it is not to come back again. That girl went away to her husband's house. Her husband's house was at Multan'.</p>
<p class="Text">This human body, the pious land of India, Aryavarta—Specially Uttarakhand and more over, the bank of Bhagwati Ganga, the seat of its sand, the water of Ganga is available to drink and bathe. There is no other more secluded and pious place than this. You cannot get such opportunity at your own residence. There is no other shade better in comparison to the shade of the banyan tree which remains warm in winter and cool in summer. <span class="char-style-override-3">'Sanatan Dharma'</span> is the most ancient. Even having got such an opportunity to be born in such a blessed Country, time and caste if our redemption is not done then, Tulasidasji says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जो न तरै भव सागर नर समाज अस पाइ। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सो कृत निंदक मंदमति आत्माहन गति जाइ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Shriramcharitmanas, Uttar. 44) </p>
<p class="Text">'The man who, though equipped with all these resources fails to cross the ocean of metempsychosis is ungrateful and dull-witted and meets the fate of a self-murderer.'</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सो परत्र दुख पावइ सिर धुनि धुनि पछिताइ। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कालहि कर्महि ईस्वरहि मिथ्या दोस लगाइ।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Shriramcharitmanas, Uttar. 43)</p>
<p class="Text">'He suffers torture in the other world and beats his head in remorse wrongly, attributing the blame to Time, Fate and God.'</p>
<p class="Text">There is none and nothing except the only one—'Vigyananandghan Brahma' consciousness and bliss solidified, the Supreme Brahma). Completely negate the existence of body and the world, as if they have no existence at all. There is all around bliss and bliss and remain absorbed in that 'Vigyananandghan Brahma'. The perfect bliss, boundless joy. Such type of concentration is the meditation of the attributeless formless Brahma. The form what is realized is quite unique from the form of the meditation.</p>
<p class="Text">That is the highest service to relate the spiritual matters related to God to the man who is just to breathe last even a little practice of selfless act saves one from the terrible fear of birth and death.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">No discussion of that man at the Yamraj's abode at all*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 14.4.1941, Morning, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">There should be the constant overflow of zeal and enthusiasm in the mind. If the Lord is so much graceful, it is not difficult to concentrate the mind in Him. It is the most significant grace of the Lord that he blessed us with this human body and our birth on the pious land of India and we are fortunate to get the bank of Bhagirathi River. And more and above than this is that we were born in the <span class="char-style-override-3">'Sanatan Dharma'</span>—which is considered the origin of all. And in addition this most sacred place besides it, this is the 'Kaliyuga' (one of the four epochs) which requires the least spiritual discipline to attain the Supreme Being, and talking about the Lord and all these things are got only by the Lord's grace.</p>
<p class="Text">If this scene is remembered even after going home, the waves of renunciation are but natural to rise. Here  Sattivika sentiment and renunciation is natural. This is the 'Ganga', whose mere view makes our innerself pure and Sattvika and what a great merit is earned if we bathe in it and drink its water. In the Shastras it has been mentioned even to the extent for the holy Gangaji that a man is purified by the visit to the Gangaji and in the end he attains the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shankaracharyaji states—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">भगवद‍्गीता किंचिदधीता </p>
<p class="SHLOK">गंगाजललवकणिका पीता। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सकृदपि यस्य मुरारिसमर्चा </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्य यमः किं कुरुते चर्चा॥</p>
<p class="Text">"Can the Lord Yama even think to discuss about the man who has only gone through the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> with a bird eye view, who has taken only a drop of 'Gangajala' (the water of Gangaji),who has worshiped the Lord Shri Krishna only once?'</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The man, who reads the Gita with a bird eye view only, and uses the drop of 'Gangajal' (the water of Gangaji) cannot be discussed even in the world of Yama, his soul is purified. This is the tradition here among us that when the man dies, he is made to listen the Gitaji, he is given the basil leaf and 'Gangajal' (the water of Gangaji) to drink. We are present here on the bank of Ganga—this is the obligation of 'Bhagirathi' (Ganga) only and the grace of the Lord is already. He who is blessed with the grace of the Lord is blessed by all. We should contemplate with the mind of detachment. When the word 'Bliss' is sounded again and again a unique tranquility of mind we feel at that time. This is the unequal wonderful grace of the Lord. Before the meditation our instincts are pacified. Only a little concentration of mind in the meditation increases our mental peace to overflow, the Supreme Being who is in the changeless form, manifests. At that time we feel and experience a unique tranquility. Before this the principle of Gitaji is being explained to you. In reality the principle of Gitaji is known to the Lord only. This is the ocean of knowledge and devotion, it is profound-bottomless, and he who takes dip into it forgets his own-self and he becomes <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> personified. The Ganga of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> is for the highest good of the inner soul, only by adopting a single verse of the Ganga of Gita our salvation can be possible. A single verse of the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> is sufficient for the Lord's attainment. We can call <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> even more valuable than Ganga. He who bathes in the Ganga emancipates only himself, but he who bathes in the Ganga of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> can emancipate others also.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Benevolence of the both—the hearer and the reciter*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 31.5.1943, Morning, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">Man should try to die while muttering divine name or meditating on God. Such death is superior to the death in Kashi even. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Gita 8/5)</p>
<p class="Text">'He, who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state; there is no doubt about it.'</p>
<p class="Text">Lord! I am not worthy of Your apparent sight. O Lord! Bless me with your remembrance at the time of death. Negotiate this deal with God in the return of all auspicious deeds of the whole life if possible. Nothing should be demanded from the Lord, but if it is necessary then demand this. Bali at the time of death demands—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जेहिं जोनि जन्मौं कर्म बस तहँ राम पद अनुरागऊँ॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Now, my Lord! Look upon me with compassion and grant me the boon that I ask; in whatever species of life it may be my fate to be born, I may continue to love Shri Ram's (your) feet.' What a great sacrifice of self-interest; that is why the Lord Shri Ram blessed His Supreme Abode to Bali.</p>
<p class="Text">Go and make the brothers and sisters who are to die, listen to the Lord's Name at the last moment of their death. If the soul of the man at the edge of the death departs from his body remembering the Lord's name due to hearing that Name, his purpose of crossing the world sea is accomplished, the work of the brother to relate is done. This condition of death of the last time is even more valuable than to die in Kashi. This death is superior to even at seven religious holy places (Ayodhya, Mathura, Mayapuri (from Kankhal to Lakshman Jhula), Kashi, Kanchi, Ujjain, and Dwarikaupri). The man who dies in Kashi gets deliverance only when he has suffered the punishment of his sins, there is the period of thirty six thousand years to suffer the punishment of his sins. But he, who departs from this body remembering the Lord's Name, appearance, attributes, glory, influence, essence and mystery, is liberated at once. He gets the just emancipation. Whether he dies at any ignoble place instead to die in Kashi.</p>
<p class="Text">This is not the matter of any concession or relaxation but this is the common Divine law—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Gita 8/6)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun! Thinking of whatever entity one leaves the body at the time of death, that and that alone one attains, being ever absorbed in its thought.'</p>
<p class="Text">If one remembers the dog at the time of death, he gets the birth of a dog, if he remembers donkey, he is going to be born as a donkey. Similarly, he who remembers the God attains God.</p>
<p class="Text">The allopathic medicine generally contains the impure objects, which make us of Tamasika mentality. At the time of the death the man who has Tamasika mentality, becomes either a tree or mountain. It is better to use the indigenous, pure and pious herbal medicine than to use the allopathic medicines. If he is to remain alive he will be cured with the herbal medicines of a physician also. The loud chanting of the Lord's Name before the man who is at the point of death should be done so that there might be the highest good of his soul.</p>
<p class="Text">Bhishmaji is lying on the bed of arrows he desires water; Arjun produced the 'Gangajal' (the water of Gangaji) by shooting his arrow. Bhishmaji was the son of Ganga; only that water was worthy for him. At the last moment of life if the 'Gangajal' (the water of Gangaji) is given to drink, the mind and wisdom become pure and the inner-self is purified. There is created the sense of Divinity in him.</p>
<p class="Text">Pronounce the Lord's Name by your speech, when the speech goes tired, mutter with breath and concentrate your mind to the Lord. Bow before the Lord with head and hands. Salvation is done only by remembering the Lord's Name. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is pleased with anyone of the devotional song, meditation and the chanting of the Lord's name. In the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> the lords has stated—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘यज्ञानां जपयज्ञोऽस्मि’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 10/25) 'Among sacrifices, I am the sacrifice of Japa (muttering of sacred formulas).'</p>
<p class="Text">If the death is close, try to sing the devotional song, meditation on the Lord and mutter the sacred formulas. If it is the time of other one's death and he gets the chance to make him listen the Lord's name, it is a matter of great pleasure. To feed others and if needed, the spirit of self-sacrifice is the sentiment of very high category.</p>
<p class="Text"><span class="char-style-override-4">‘त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 12/12) 'Peace immediately follows from renunciation.' As higher is the sacrifice so high he is spiritually evolved.</p>
<p class="Text">If it is the oracle—'Who is the one whose deliverance should be done? If it is asked to me, I will say—'O the lord! Leaving me only do the good of anyone whosoever he may be.' If everyone repeats the same there will be good of all. But if all of us repeat of self well-being only, then, God will ask to decide and name the single one. If unanimously it is not decided the Lord will disappear.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">He, who wants the spiritual welfare of others leaving the matter of self welfare, gets the chance to distribute ever the free food of salvation. To get release means to get rest. Really, we should demand for other's service. Let us remain distributing free food ever; it may be for self to remain on fast. This fast gives us the maximum peace, this is the supernatural joy.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">'Shri Bhagwan said—Arjun, you grieve over those who should not be grieved for and yet speak like the learned, wise men do not sorrow over the dead or the living'.</p>
<p class="Text">So many such brothers also come here so that they may get rid of their worry to hear the sermons to come here. All are sunk into worry. They do hear the virtuous words but don't follow. The deer graze green grass in the woods, but they are unaware that the lion will kill them to come suddenly. Similarly, in the same way we enjoy the sensual pleasures, but it is not known to us that the death will attack and kill us suddenly.</p>
<p class="Text">Nowadays, the children of young age generally die in more numbers, anyone may die at any time without the consideration of age group. Those who have already died, have passed away; those who are alive, have also to die, there is no way to escape from death.</p>
<p class="Text">If anyone in the family dies there should not be worry and mourning. Let it not be mourned at all. The same sermon was given by the Lord Shri Krishna to Arjun that—'You grieved for those who ought not to be grieved, you grieve over the family members. That is not to be grieved over'.</p>
<p class="Text">If anyone passes away in the family the outsiders come to visit, the visitors have to bear great troubles in their journey. If death occurs in anyone's family the visitors should be requested not to pay their visit through the letter that what was to happen that had already happened. They should not take the trouble of their journey.</p>
<p class="Text">Every brother, sister and mother should try to understand and should bring it in practice after understanding that the religious congregation should be organized in the grief of the family. When Abhimanyu died, the sages came and gave sermon to the king Yudhisthir that Abhimanyu did not deserve mourning. He who commits suicide deserves to be grieved.</p>
<p class="Text">The land here is the pious land of pilgrimage, Mayapuri, if anyone dies here, he should not be mourned. It is much better if the congregational singing of the Lord's name and His attributes continues at the time of death. There is a fable in <span class="char-style-override-3">'Vishnu Puran'</span>—'The Lord Yamaraj is instructing his messengers not to go to that dead where the congregational singing is going on.'</p>
<p class="Text">Near the person who is on the verge of death there should be recitation of the verses of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>, religious congregation should be held there and there should be the chanting of the Lord's name. if the basil leaf and 'Gangajala' is given to drink, the messengers of Yama cannot come there at all definitely.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">‘गङ्गाजललवकणिका पीता।’</p>
<p class="Text">'Where there is so, that man can never go to the abode of Yama of Yamaraj even. The Lord has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/5)</p>
<p class="Text">'He who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state; there is no doubt about it'.</p>
<p class="Text">This land itself near the bank of the Ganga is benedictory. Through Arjun making him the medium the Lord has given the sermon to the whole world. This is the matter of regret that the purpose why we were born in this world as human could not be fulfilled. The time passed is not to come back again. The rest period of life should be used for this purpose. If we failed to attain the deliverance even after getting the human life when will we get it again? Deliverance means to be free from fear, remorse etc. to be free from the cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p class="Text">There is no reason of anguish by anyway. Bali died, Tara began to mourn. The Lord gave her sermon and then, she came to get knowledge and her grief vanished. When Tara got knowledge, she demanded the boon of devotion from the Lord. We should learn the lesson that if anyone dies in the family, one should not grieved over. The Lord states this in the Gitaji that to have grief for the soul is not proper—</p>

<p class="Text">The soul is neither born nor dies, the soul is eternal, unborn, constant.It is immutable. This soul is eternal, even when the body perishes the soul  doesn't perish.</p>
<p class="Text">Why should there be grief for the body also? The Lord says—</p>

<p class="Text">'Arjun, before birth beings are not manifest to our human senses; at death they return to the un-manifest again. They are manifest only in the interim between birth and death. What occasion, then, for lamentation?</p>
<p class="Text">As anyone is bestowed the kingdom of India in the dream and deprived of that kingdom begins to weep when he gets up from sleep, the same case is here. It is inevitable that the body will perish. Why should be the lamentation for that what is perishable?</p>
<p class="Text">This is the doctrine of fools that the soul is born and dies. If suppose, their principle is accepted, even according to their principle also it is proved that they who are born must die thus, on the ground of any principle or by any way to grieve is not appropriate. </p>
<p class="Text">If it is said that we weep in the lamentation because the soul separates from the body, that is also not needed to be grieved. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि। </p>

<p class="Text">'If this is your argument that you lament on the separation of the soul from the body that is also not logical because—As a man shedding worn out garments, takes other new ones, likewise, the embodied soul, casting off worn out bodies, enters into others that are new.'</p>
<p class="Text">If you argue that this sermon was for Arjun, where there were present the old, young etc., the men of all the categories. The fact is that he who has reached the expiry of the duration of his life, is old. Even the old garment having been washed by the washerman looks like new one; but it is the washerman who knows what the old are and what are new garments. Likewise the Lord knows everyone, who is new and who is old. He says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">वेदाहं समतीतानि वर्तमानानि चार्जुन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भविष्याणि च भूतानि मां तु वेद न कश्चन ॥</p>

<p class="Text">'Arjun! I know all beings, past as well as present, nay, even those that are yet to come; but none, devoid of faith and devotion, knows Me.'</p>
<p class="Text">Those who have finished their age are old. The span of life variates from individual to individual. The durability of the garments also variates as five years, two years and some one year. If anyone asks that at the time of putting off the old garment and putting on the new garment there is a sort of gratification who feel gratified? They are the men of matured mind and understanding who feel delighted and not a child. A child does weep while changing the garment. But the mother does not care for his tears at all. Similarly the Lord does not care for us and He changes the old dirty body to the new body. The wise and sensible men don't weep at any one's death. The Lord has stated—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति॥</p>

<p class="Text">'Just as boyhood, youth and old age are attributed to the soul through this body, even so it attains another body. The wise man does not get deluded about this.'</p>
<p class="Text">This is what we have to understand that if anybody dies in the family and we weep at his demise; this is our foolishness. If anyone weeps he betrays his foolishness. We should weep for the Lord, this is the sermon of the saints.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">केशव केशव कूकिये न कूकिये असार।</p>
<p class="Text">'O Keshava! O Lord! O Hari! Let us weep in this way. Let us never weep for this transient world. The people weep for this worthless world, but there is no gain to weep for this ephemeral world.'</p>
<p class="Text">On the visit of the sage Durvasa, Draupadi made the call to the Lord and the Lord at once appeared. It is beneficial to weep for the Lord. We should weep for the object that may give us peace.</p>
<p class="Text">The soul is eternal but this body is mortal, so we should never grieve over. From devotion point of view it should be understood that if anyone of the family members passed away why to lament for him? You reside here in the 'Gita Bhawan', you deposit money here to me and get back your money at the time of departure. If I feel sorrow, it will be my stupidity. Similarly, the Lord sent the boy to me for protection, the Lord again takes him back. It will be our stupidity if we weep for that boy; As we keep with us the object belonging to someone else smilingly, to return if back smilingly is honesty. How can we keep object belonging to other. This is the humanity that we return the object belonging to other delightfully otherwise we would be disgraced and we would be obliged to return the object. At the God's abode there is better arrangement for him. If we weep then God would say that how he can be my devotee. If he had been my devotee he would have willed as I willed. None can die without God's will. The real devotee is he who does not anguish or tell sorrow on what has been done by God. Thinking equiably we should remian happy.</p>
<p class="Text">From the point of view of Karmayoga let us think. Somebody is born and he died. Think over what is the cause we weep because we brought him up for sixteen years, spent money and he expired. We should think that we were indebted to him. He passed away by getting his debt cleared off. We were his debtors, now we have paid off his debt. Now we are free of his debt. We should feel happy being free of debt and we should pray to God to free us from debts of all others and free me of my sins by awarding punishment. Bhishma Pitamaha prays that whatever my sins are, may bring sufferings in this body.</p>
<p class="Text">From the angle of dispassion we should not grieve. We sit in the train. During the journey many passengers board the train.  If anyone goes away, we feel happy rush has became less. Likewise our home is a compartment of the Railway train. If somebody dies, than it is good. What is the matter to grieve over. We assumed their as our son or as our grandson then we feel sorrow. In the world day and night boys go on dying. As we inculcate the sense of mineness with them as the son nd grandson, therefore, we lament. Thinking on these lives every mother, brother or sister should not grieve over.</p>
<p class="Text">The root cause of sorrow is only the sense of mineness. We show our attachment that he is my brother, she is my wife; but the attachment should be linked with what is the truth, which may not cause us weep. The absolute truth is the Supreme Being; the perishable is this object of world. If anyone loves God he will have not to weep. If the attachment was established with the Lord there cannot be separation from Him at any cost. It is only the Lord worthy of love, so having detached our mind from all the objects we should love the Lord only. The love to the Lord alone is called the exclusive devotion. There is no need of anyone. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">ज्ञातुं द्रष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च परंतप॥</p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Baishakh Krishna 11, Samvat 1993, Year 1936 Evening, Tibadi, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">If any spiritual discipline you may be able to put into practice or not it does not matter but you should never give up meditation on God. The Lord removes all the obstacles. Concentration of mind in the God removes away all the outer and inner hurdles—determine it in your mind. Whatever the form that reflects on the serene of your mind at the last moment of death determines the same form for your next birth. So, make the practice to remember the Lord at the time of your death before hand. Make the excess of practice to mutter the Lord's Name. By the concentration of mind to the Lord the cheerfulness and peace remain continued. At the time of muttering divine names the ill conduct, lust, anger etc., don't come near.</p>
<p class="Text">Meditation is the prime part of devotion. The Lord says—'He, who remembers Me constantly, the responsibility of his well-being is on My shoulder. The Shastras state that the particles of dust can be counted but how many times this living being will be born cannot be counted. It is not known how many times this soul became Indra and Brahma. The remembrance of the Lord is the support for a man drowning in the ocean of the world. Never leave the hold of this rope of meditation whether we may again get the human body or not. Who knows whether such opportunity will be again got or not. Leave even the most important work for the cause of meditation, but never spurn the meditation of the Lord. We should not depend on future to get such a chance in the next birth. How can it be decided about what form we will get in the next birth. So, leaving all the works do this work first.</p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 15.12.1959, Ramdham, Chitrakuta.</p>
<p class="Text">1. The pleasure is experienced at the time of enjoyment of the worldly enjoyments but its result is very painful.</p>
<p class="Text">2. The progress of others if creates the feeling of jealousy and sorrow later on, that is called anguish.</p>
<p class="Text">3. First the man enjoys the comforts of life in the beginning but when he gets sorrow later on, he weeps day and night.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—Even though accepting the Lord the excellent man does not concentrate his mind to the Lord, what is the reason?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—There is lack of faith and belief, and no other cause comes to mind. To have faith in the Lord as well as in the Gitaji, love in the Lord should be developed.</p>
<p class="Text">4. The renunciation from the world can also be possible by the company of the virtuous persons, religious congregations and the study of Shastras, by creating love in the Lord and feeling of suffering in the worldly sensual enjoyments.</p>
<p class="Text">5. There is nothing in the world like God at all, if this Faith develops in the mind, love in the Lord will be created. As much value to love the Lord gives so much value is given by none. There is no bound of the virtuous qualities in the Lord. If we think of His charm, nobility, attributes, influence, glory, compassion, generosity, kind- heartedness, etc., these so many virtues we will find nowhere else. If this faith and conviction develops in us it is sure that the love to the Lord will be created in.</p>
<p class="Text">6. The act of Lord's dealing is also wonderful. Even the enemies are amazed at this behavior. </p>
<p class="Text">7. If we become confident, feel determined that none is our such well-wisher as the Lord, our love in the Lord would develop.</p>
<p class="Text">8. By the muttering and chanting of the Lord's Name or by meditating Him our love in the Lord is generated.</p>

<p class="Text">9. The happiness and peace what is there in the Lord's feet is nowhere in any one or in any object, if this confidence and faith is rooted in us, we may begin to love God.</p>
<p class="Text">I have left myself totally for every concern to the Lord's will and I am happy in every eventuality. If we get free from self-desire and accept the Lord's will as our own will, then, there is no doubt in our well being. If you gave priority to self-will, you felt great sorrow. By merging self-desire into the Lord's will, our function is over, whatever happens there is only happiness and joy.</p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Shri Sukhadevji Agrawal, Trustee, Gita Press, has abandoned his body in the presence of Sethji in Chitrakuta.</p>
<p class="Text"> Answer—Think in your mind that you are going to the Supreme Abode of the Lord and I have to do nothing. Be firm determined that there is no doubt in my redemption.</p>
<p class="Text">This is for all of you that you should assure the man whose death is over his head that his salvation is sure without the least doubt. He, who departs from this body, remembering and chanting the Lord's Name, singing congregational singing in His praise or hearing the same is sure to attain deliverance.</p>
<p class="Text">For those living beings who are alive it is advisable that they should chant the devotional song, they should meditate the Lord, they should follow the advice of the Gita and saints more and there is no doubt in their salvation.</p>
<p class="Text">If any exalted soul only sights the dead-body of anyone, he goes away directly to the Lord from that world where he had gone.</p>
<p class="Text">Make the man of death-bed listen the words related to the spiritual knowledge, devotion, congregational singing so long as he is in sense, when he has lost his consciousness then chant loudly divine names.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—While performing the worldly actions why is the Lord forgotten?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—If this world is realized as dream, there will be no attachment in this world. Take this world as the frolicsome activities of the Lord in the path of devotion. The attachment what we have developed with our body of this world, money, wife-son etc. is the root cause of downfall, it should be rooted out.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The concentration of mind in the sensuous objects means to think of the worldly enjoyments is very harmful, and likewise if the contemplation of the Lord begins to start it is very beneficent.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">Even the foulest of all sinners gets salvation by seeking shelter to the Lord, this is the super natural influence of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord plays in the dust of 'Yashoda's' courtyard, every particle of this dust has the deliverance-giving power only on account of its touch to the Lord's feet. This is the supernatural divine influence of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Influence of the great souls is likewise. Wherever they stayed that place became the holy place of Pilgrimage, where the husband-devotee chaste woman halted, that place also become the holy place of Pilgrimage. As for example, there is the temple of 'Annsuiyaji' at the distance of eleven miles from here, Annsuiyaji is considered to be the foremost among the husband devotees. On death in Ayodhya, Mathura and Vrindavan there is salvation.</p>
<p class="Text">While making any transaction at that time remember the Lord Ramchandraji, you can be a big gainer. It should not be said that I have been a big gainer.</p>
<p class="Text">He, who departs from this body remembering the Lord, chanting the congregational singing and hearing Lord's Name, and loud chanting of divine names saluting the Lord, is blessed with the emancipation.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">He, who departs from this body muttering the Lord's Name, hearing the fables and Gitaji etc., attains the deliverance.

<p class="Text">To serve the destitute,sorphans, poor, and helpless is the service. To make the dying man listen to the Lord's Name and to publicize <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> is the highest service. The Lord says for the preacher of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">न च तस्मान्मनुष्येषु कश्चिन्ये प्रियकृत्तमः। </p>

<p class="Text">'Among the men there is none who does Me a more loving service than he; nor shall anyone be dearer to Me in the entire world than he.'</p>
<p class="Text">We should remain completely quiet for four hours. One should do so to whom it suits one who engages in spiritual discipline he should do so. The sleeping time during night should be converted into spiritual discipline. In the night while going to sleep one should indulge in repeating the Lord's Name, meditation and contemplation of His frolic activities etc.</p>
<p class="Text">Increase your practice of spiritual discipline every time day by day. Introspect it each and every hour whether it waxes or not, if not increased then let us find out why did it not increase? The Lord says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम्। </p>

<p class="Text">'Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the supreme Lord of all the world, and the disinterested friend of all beings, My devotee attains peace.'</p>
<p class="Text">If any diseased person comes in your contact then serve him intensely with the body, mind and wealth. Treat him God or think the presence of the Lord in him because the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities is only the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">He, who serves all other beings with unselfish motive for the welfare of others doesn't have fear of anything. For instance, offer your service fearlessly to the patient of T.B., cholera and plague etc., the volunteer need not fear of anything. I have done such works with great enthusiasm, and nothing happened to me. Whatever work is done with unselfish motive that is always benedictory.</p>
<p class="Text">At every foot of the verse of Gitaji there is some mystery. If studying <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> one lives it in his life he gets salvation then what is to say, about him he can do the highest good to others also. The Lord has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन। </p>

<p class="Text">By acting upon this verse the deliverance becomes possible very soon. Its fruit is received even in the life-time.</p>
<p class="Text">Your right is to work only but never to the fruit thereof. To give the fruit is the matter of the Lord's jurisdiction. The 'right' should be taken in the sense that I have no right. If the right is claimed only the fruit of the work as it is will be received.</p>
<p class="Text">According to the view of the Lord Rama he has no right of the sovereignty for fourteen years. Bharatji says that he has no right. Here, the sacrifice of the both is praiseworthy. This is the sentiment of unselfishness. Bharat controlled the royal affairs but did not enjoy the royal comforts.</p>
<p class="Text">After the cow is given in charity to the Brahman, she can be served but her milk cannot be consumed. Similarly, our right is to work only, we have no right in its fruit. If any good work is done that should be done well without claiming the right of fruit.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord says—'Do not be the cause of the fruit of action, if you become the cause of the fruit of action, you will have to suffer and you will be devoid of the emancipation. The deliverance is achieved only when you are free from the desire of fruit. Neither it should be uttered by the speech that I have done this noble deed nor nurse any egoistic feeling in the mind. The work should be done without the attachment of fruit. Neither should be there the egotism, attachment nor lurking desire, nor intense desire but not to have at all any contact with it. As the fruit of virtuous and noble deed is the heaven but from the heaven he will have to come back again to this mortal world. It could not make him to get rid of the life and death. By performing actions for my sake, you get salvation.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">You should not have your inclination to remain away from action also. The action should be free from the sense mineness and attachment etc.<span></span></p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 24.12.1959, Ramdham, Chitrakuta.</p>
<p class="Text">We heard more in the association of saints but there came no change in our mentality, without the change of mentality the striver doesn't evolve much.</p>
<p class="Text">There should be the feeling in the mind to serve and do good to all, it leads to progress soon.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—How will be the constant adoration of God?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—The constant adoration can be possible by the association of that person who has love in the Lord or who always adores God.</p>
<p class="Text">There is nothing more and higher than the muttering of the Lord's Name. When the muttering of the Lord's Name becomes the source of immerse joy and divine bliss, the muttering of Name will never go out of mind. There is nothing superior to the Lord's Name. This is stated by the Shastras and saints, so it should be accepted. As we sacrifice our neck to the hands of the advocate having given our signature to him, we give him money also due to our compelling need and get recommended also.  A great virtuous saint does not even charge money from you, and gives you medicine to be free from the bond of life and death, so having faith in him the work should be started.</p>
<p class="Text">As having faith in the doctor we act upon his advice, likewise having so much faith in the Lord if we are seeking shelter to the Lord our purpose will be served. The boat of our life will cross the ocean of the world if we develop only so much faith in the Lord as much faith we have in the physician or an advocate. There is lack of our faith and acceptance.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>

<p class="Text">'He, who sees Me (the Universal Self) present in all beings and all beings in Me, never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him.'</p>
<p class="Text">As there remains sky in the clouds, there is no such place equal to even a particle in it which is empty of sky; similarly the Lord is present in this world. We should do what the Lord commands; the residue responsibility rests with the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">The peace and happiness of the man who mutters the Lord's Name will continue in the natural way. If you feel the absence of peace and joy it means the muttering is not being practiced as it should be. When the muttering starts being performed in the natural way, the peace and happiness will begin to be felt automatically. Unless the muttering of the Lord's Name does not take the shape of nature, there remains the lack of peace and happiness.</p>
<p class="Text">Agree to my only these words that what I say that is perfectly true based on my own experience that the Lord's Name is the superior most. By muttering the Lord's Name, the memory of the Lord's Name and appearance remains fresh in the natural way.</p>
<p class="Text">What the Lord, the great souls and Shastras state are true to say already their words should be taken true and advantage should be taken. We do believe the physician and advocate, then we should have more faith in the Lord, Mahatma and Shastras.</p>
<p class="Text">It is doubtful whether the medicine of physician will prove successful in saving our life or not, but by following the words of the Mahatma's there remains no trace of the disease of recurring life and death.</p>
<p class="Text">The complete fruit of muttering the Lord's Name is received by that devotee who mutters with love and devotion and selfless motive. As the breath remains in function automatically without any effort, similarly the muttering of the Lord's Name should remain in the process of continuing. The muttering of the Lord's Name with love and devotion without any motive of self-interest is very valuable.</p>
<p class="Text">The entire earning of your life is on one side of the balance and the Lord's Name is on the next side of the balance. The side of the Lord's Name will be heavier. Even if you may have the deposit of even a crore of rupees but it will not go with you, will be of no use for you but the Lord's Name will liberate you from the circle of life and death, it will do your highest good.</p>
<p class="Text">At the time of death if the Lord's Name is remembered even without love and devotion it gets you redemption. This is the special grace of the Lord. He may be the foulest sinner, but he will get the salvation if he keeps remembering the Lord at the time of death.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">At the time of death if it is heard the sound of the birds and animals, it should be removed away. No roar should be made. Remove away the dog and sparrows from there. If any bird or animals appeared in your memory you will be born in the same form in the next birth. So the birds, animals and the objects of the bad category should be removed away from the place of the dying man.<span></span></p>

Take the round of the whole Earth once or make the pronunciation of the Lord's Name only once, what is the need to wander about? We should make such a journey that we may not need to make the journey of this world again. If it arrives the time of death determine it that there is no doubt in my salvation. Each and every of all the objects are worth providing salvation—as pronounce the Lord's Name once. Gitaji, 'Gangajala' (water of Ganga), Kashi, the company of great souls all are deliverance giving.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">He whose house has caught fire does not take sleep. If fire breaks out at any one's house, he shouts loudly, 'Extinguish, extinguish the fire', the same is the case of old age, death, now, there is no time, do the work hastily otherwise the house will burn to ashes, he who comes to see the house on fire, does not hear any other word. Your age is passing away. This is what the house on fire is. Time is the real money, it is getting wasted uselessly. The waste of time is like the house on fire. You only slept and wasted your time uselessly in the condemnation of others. To spend the time in the worldly enjoyments, heedlessness, laziness and vices—all these four are to set fire in your house. Without having extinguished the fire, he does not take rest. These who sleep in this way, have set fire in their house. They who consider time invaluable never waste their time. Taking the shelter of the Lord's grace the practice of adoration—meditation should be exercised more and more. First it restrains egoism and secondly the Lord's mercy helps. By making efforts His mercy blooms. Endeavour should not be left on destiny. Let the fruit be left on destiny. This is the mercy of the Lord that we should make efforts. It is false only to call—'Mercy-Mercy'. Efforts should be made to know the glory of the Lord, His mystery, and the essence of the truth from the exalted souls and the Shastras. His glory and His capacity is so great that our emancipation can be made possible within a moment and His mystery can be made known to us.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text para-style-override-5">To say this is not a new topic, the same a few subject-matter to harp on the same theme already stated. Panditji had said to introduce any new topic, the subject matter is old already, if it is acted upon it is new from this point of view. Talks regarding God should be talked about again and again. They are ever new. It is meant to say what a man should do in his life, if the attention is given on this point, it will come out that mostly the people are doing wrong. That what is to be achieved in the human life, having abandoned the efforts to attain it, to make busy oneself in the other immaterial work is a mistake, and all are committing this mistake. All the possessions of those who die remain lying here in this world. Each and every particle which was claimed as one's own on death it goes to the possession of other one. The man who dies with latent desires generally becomes a goblin. He sees before his eyes that his possessions are being owned by others. His grief goes beyond limit. He remains grieved. He goes to the hell and suffers again and again.<span></span></p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 13.3.1942, Night,  Sahebganj, Gorakhpur.</p>
<p class="Text">We should consider our time priceless. Still we don't understand the value of time. The people differ from individual to individual in giving value to the time according to his own wit or mind. We should take support of the great intellectual's wisdom. A mason gives value to his time comparing it to his wages, what is his wages of the whole day. If he gets eight annas as the wages of his whole day work he thinks eight annas as the value of the day, he does not want to make worthless talk even for an hour. There are doctors etc. they give more value to the time the patient is serious, we request the doctor to stay the whole night with the patient, then, the doctor says—'I will charge fifty rupees of the whole night'. They also give the value of their time as rupees fifty. Similarly there is any advocate. He also understands the value of his time. You talked to him for an hour. He sent the bill of rupees thirty two as his fees. He understood rupees thirty two as the value of his time. The barristers give value to their time even more than they. But if it is considered with the spiritual point of view that all of them are fools who sell their time. Even he, who gets the monthly salary of twenty five thousands is in loss. He also does not understand the value the time. If the value of one day is fixed rupees one Lakh, that is also less. The time cannot be valued with money. What is the utility of rupees? You get only comforts, in place of the value of time the whole kingdom of India is given, that is also nothing before it. If suppose, I died the next day, even then the enjoyment of the kingship was only of one day. To think the whole kingdom as its value, that is also insufficient. To understand heaven as its value, that is also underestimation because it is stated in the <span class="char-style-override-3">Ramayana</span>—</p>

<p class="Text">He who passes his time in the enjoyments of the world has been condemned by all the Shastras. It should be well thought where the time to be invested. Our time should be invested in the works of the highest category. It should not be invested for the sovereignty, heaven and even for the three worlds. This invaluable time is not for them. Suppose, you got the rule of all the three worlds after the whole day labour and the next day, your death is fixed then, who will enjoy the kingship of all the three worlds? If you pass your time for this kingship, you commit a blunder. The time should be passed in the work that may prove worthful to pass the time, which fruit is everlasting and perfect. Leave that work atonce then and there of which fruit is imperfect. What is the perfect-imperfect?</p>
<p class="Text">Imperfect—You enjoyed the sensuous objects of the world till today could you be satisfied? No, our desires are never fulfilled and we remain craving for more pleasures.</p>

<p class="Text">As the earthen pot when it becomes full with water there remains no space to fill it with water. In the same way, when our heart is filled with joy and remains no room for more. All of us can avail that joy, here is the right of human beings as a whole, even the greatest sinner the greatest fool is entitled. Even one is to die today he has also the right. Time was not under your control and even then, if you came to be sensible, there is chance. The Supreme Lord can be attained in a single minute. As in any cave there is the darkness for thousand of years, the whole cave can be illuminated in a moment, the darkness will not claim that it has been remaining here for long. How do you illumine in a moment? Likewise a vilest sinner can have the oppurtunity of being redeemed by God. There is room even for a block headed.

<p class="Text">'This knowledge (of both the Nirguna and Saguna aspects of Divinity) is a sovereign science, a sovereign secret, supremely holy, most excellent, directly enjoyable attended with virtue, very easy to practice and imperishable.'</p>
<p class="Text">If it is so, then why don't you attain the Lord? There is lack of faith—you continue to revolve in the ocean of death not attaining God.</p>
<p class="Text">Why did the Lord say this—'Not attaining Me you revolve? As the son of a king has birthright of the kingship. But if he goes against the command of the king, instead of getting the empire he will be sent to jail. Here, the Supreme Lord is the king, as the prince has the birthright of the throne, likewise we also have the birthright in the attainment of the Lord, if we fail to attain the Lord it is the matter of grief for us.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord gave us sufficient opportunity to attain Him, in our whole life yet we did not attain the Lord in our whole life. Now, at the Last time even if we remember the Lord, our purpose will be served.</p>
<p class="Text">It will be great shocking if we failed to attain the Lord. We have been blessed with the human body. We should reach the Lord by making our best efforts.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—If any one succeeded in attaining the Lord, did he make the proper use of time?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Yes! He has made the proper use of time a little; because the self-deliverance can be possible in a very short time. If this fact comes to our understanding, then we may pass our time being bent upon. He, who does this, does not emancipate only himself but he can emancipate the whole world. This human body possesses such power.</p>
<p class="Text">You may say it was not done so till now. It is right, but there is no restriction to do so, positively it can be done. The Lord didn't give any such statement that it could not be done more in future.</p>
<p class="Text">The enlightened souls born till now made the highest good of thousand and lacs, but there may be any man even more than they. Until we did the redemption of the living beings as a whole, then what did we do? This should be our aim.</p>
<p class="Text">We should develop such ability in us that only by our sight, touch the highest good of the people may be done. This is the proper use of our time only a little.</p>
<p class="Text">The same is the rule of Lord Shankarji also—He, who dies in Kashi attains salvation, but we should do so that if anyone dies anywhere all should attain salvation. Nothing is impossible. Even the animals make impossible as possible, and for us what is difficult. There is an instance—There was a bird, who laid her eggs on the sea shore, the sea set the eggs afloat with its waves. Then, all the birds jointly threw out the water of the sea with their beaks and made the sea empty of water and took out their eggs from the sea. My words are not so impossible even. It is more possible. This should be kept in mind that our salvation should be after the salvation of all only.</p>
<p class="Text">With such a motive in the mind the work should be started. Have it on trial. What is the difference between the diamond and glass? If it pierces into the 'Iron' (an instrument of iron) then it is diamond and if broken that is glass. The gold never burns to ashes and the diamond doesn't break. In the same way leave that what perishes. Our time should be passed to attain what is eternal. How is the gold recognized? For this it is the touchstone, burn it in fire, if it does not lessen than it is gold—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः। </p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 2/16)</p>
<p class="Text">'The unreal has no existence, and the real never ceases to be; the reality of both has thus been perceived by the seers of Truth.'</p>
<p class="Text">That what is not stable is false, that what is Real never ceases to be. So, our time should be passed only in that work what is right. Not even a single moment should be wasted in the work what is false. It should not be at all wasted in the inadvertence. The time should not be passed in the enjoyments also. Our time should pass in the spiritual truth.</p>

<p class="Text">The practice of Karmayoga once commenced is never lost and it does not lead to contrary result. Even a little practice of this selfless action frees from the terrible fear. A little adoration, meditation in the last days of life gives deliverance. Even the selfless feelings of the last days of life with growth do the highest good to us.</p>
<p class="Text">With the blessing of human body the Lord has provided us opportunity to attain Him. On the unnecessarily  wastage of it also He again favours us with the opportunity in the last time of our life. If we remember Him even then We can achieve salvation. But being confident we should not depend on only the last time. What is surety whether the Lord or His name will come to our remembrance or not at that time due to our sufferings?</p>
<p class="Text">By predominance of adoration one develops such habit that adoration starts automatically. Due to the previous practice he is engaged in the spiritual exercise and gets the perfect accomplishment.</p>

<p class="Text">As one cannot count the number of drops in the ocean and is incapable to tell, similarly, this world is the ocean of deaths. How many times are we to be born and die, cannot be counted and said. The embodied soul has been wandering about coming here and again he is ready to depart. There is no end of the cycle of this world for an individual soul. Only the attainment of the Lord is to get rid of this worldly circle. In future there is so heavy sorrow we do not believe in it. The saints and great souls don't weep but they repent like weeping about what will be their condition in future? The Lord is also stating to revolve in the cycle of this world remaining devoid of the Supreme goal of salvation. Was there any possibility of attainment? Un-obtainable is not prohibited. In reality man has the birthright of attaining the Lord. As a prince has birthright on the throne, similarly, the mankind as a whole has the birthright to attain the Lord. But this fool spurns it outright. The Lord places His hand on our head and we remove it. The king deprives his worthless son from the right of kingship unwillingly.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord says that this condition is in want of our faith. That faith can be created to know the Lord's glory and His attributes otherwise there is a great misery. The vital air stays in the body that has the nine gates, this is a wonder. What is there strange if the vital air goes out of it?

What will you do with this money? You may have five thousand rupees with you, even then you will eat the same quantity of food what you will eat even after possessing five crores of rupees, and can you use the money for yourself? All are departing leaving the money here, the same condition will be mine also. So we should do such work that we may be happy forever. This can be got in this human body. That is the perfect bliss, which can never be destroyed. That everlasting happiness can be attained in this body only. That human body is availed to us then why is delay? That which gives us momentary peace, whose vision is not worthful, we have become its slave and that whose vision may do our the highest good we have not a single minute for that. What is the reason? Foolishness. Whose is the labour behind the honey which is used by the world? The labour of the honey-bees. That is only the labour of the bees but its use is made by the others. Similarly, we collect the money, we do the labour but that will be used by others. So, we should try for such joy that may be everlasting.</p>
<p class="Text">The real happiness is the Supreme Being. He is the eternal object. The worldly joys are merely the glittering of that real reflection, what is the use to catch it? The worldly enjoyment are not lasting by any means. The form of the Lord is like the Sun, that is needed to be possessed. There lies the great opportunity in this human body, there is no other class of birth better than the human being and there is no better time then the Kaliyuga. Even after the penance of ten thousand years in the 'Satyayuga' the work what was not accomplished, can be fulfilled in a moment today. This is the Lord's grace. If we observe minutely on the basis of principle all the other religions are incomplete, this our 'Sanatana Dharama' is eternal without beginning. Out of other religions some are  two thousand years old the others are four thousand years old. We are fortunate to be born in this 'Sanatan Dharam' and even then, is the delay proper? We have knowledge of some letters also, from time to time the religious congregations are also on the spiritual topics, yet if we fail to attain deliverance we will be bound to weep. To blame the destiny in failing to attain the Lord is quite false because the Lord's attainment depends on our efforts, the effort depends upon divine grace that Lord's grace is already attained to us. The Lord's mercy points out  that the Lord will verily be attained. Bharataji Maharaj is stating—</p>

<p class="Text">If the Lord considers our sins also, is our emancipation possible even in the crores of years? But the Lord does not take account of our sins, He forgets it all. The second point is that the omens are propitious to Bharatji, his right arm throbs. Our omens are that we are born in superior religion, noble country noble race these are the good signs, and even then why should we not have conviction that the Lord will meet us. If you argue that we have the worry of livelihood, it is foolishness. Even the dogs live a life, they have neither any business nor any commission agency nor any brokerage, yet they are alive anyhow. We are capable to speak even, can do everything. Yet why is there worry for it? This is a very triffling matter what the worry of life is even? Having this consideration in our mind if we engage ourselves in the spiritual exercise to attain the Lord it will not take much time to attain the Lord. The moment we die what is there in this world all will remain here. Our father and grand fathers went away, there are lacs of rupees in our possession, what benefit can it give to them? The same condition is waiting for us also. It needs our attention to draw that there are countless living beings. Dogs, donkeys, insets, flies all are in the circle. There is only way to get rid of this cycle in 'Kaliyuga' is in the attainment of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">The moths are burning in the lamp, the other moths also come to fall down into it, the men are also running in the same condition, they are entangled with the enjoyments, the results are also apparent before the eyes. What a foolishness it is to spend the human life in the insignificant dirty objects and at last to become the victim of death but on the other side what happiness is! Whether to burn in fire or cut into pieces but no shortage in happiness at all. 'Even though the body is slain, the soul is not'.</p>

<p class="Text">The soul is never born nor it ever dies, nor does it become on being born, for it is unborn, eternal, everlasting and primeval, so we should remain dedicated to the devotion of the Lord. Even then, why is the practice of devotion not made earnestly? There is no faith.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—How should the faith be created?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Resort to spiritual discipline when the reward is visible there then faith automatically develops.</p>
<p class="Text">A man can remember the Lord all the time. There is no love in the Lord? Why is no love? There is no faith, we must have faith. A Farmer mixes the grain into the earth only because of faith. In the same way, we should shun the worldly joy and make efforts for real joy. The objects of worldly enjoyments are the form of sorrow only.</p>

<p class="Text">It may be anyway of spiritual exercise but the muttering of the Lord's Name and the remembrance of the Lord's form is must, whether it is practised by the speech or by breath. The contemplation is made by the mind, add your wit more in it. There is the existence of the Lord, it does not require even a single penny to accept it. Make such a firm conviction in our mind that it may continue longer. With your wisdom accept the existence of the Supreme Being. There should be faith in your mind with devotion and reverence, this is called devotion. We should remember God with mind as we have accepted Him according to our intellect, there should be also the muttering of his name by speech. The Lord's remembrance and the muttering of his Name should remain continuing and for this purpose whole-hearted effort should be made to the best capacity. The death should the accepted as inevitable but to remember the lord at any cost. It is must to die but if the death is met remembering the lord's name what is better than this? Make prayer to the lord that the muttering of the lord's name may be possible at the time of death. Whether blessed with his sight or not but the muttering of His Name and the remembrance of His form with love and devotion may remain continuing, make this prayer and demand this boon from the Lord. Though it is a desire it is so holy and prime that it may bless deliverance. It may be that their body is abandoned even today but our soul should depart from the body remembering the lord's Name. The death may be caused at any mean place instead of the Bank of the Ganga river. But your remembrance must remain continuing forever. Make prayer to the Lord—'O Lord' be graceful to help me in achieving it. This is the principle This is the spiritual discipline. This is the gist of all disciplines. Considering it as the principle observe it. If there remains any lack even in the practice of spiritual exercise, this will fulfill the gap. But if this doctrine lacks there is neither any supporter nor any means. Here on this point the Lord guarantees—</p>

If there is made the constant and regular practice then at the time of death also the Lord will be remembered in the natural way.

By performing the action thinking of the Lord in the mind there is no question of any evil deed to be committed. All the sins of the past and future will be destroyed.

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-18">Several births we have passed through*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Ashadh Krishna 8, Wednesday, Samvat 2001 (year 1944), Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">Today a talk of striking spiritual benefit is related to you. To err is but natural for him who is in the path of the Lord's attainment, who is absorbed in the practice of spiritual exercise. Man is ignorant, in the ignorance fault is natural to be possible. Whatever are the principles the accreditations, the doctrines or the different opinions all are illusion creating and at the same time deliverance providing also the one is different from the other, thus it is doubt creating and if we shape our conduct having faith in single one and act accordingly, we may get salvation. You are given the very important matter of fact it is needed to understand. The mentality to earn the money, that mentality should be given up instead of this mentality our mentality should be to attain the Lord. Our intention should be sincere and then, if there is any error in the practice, the Lord of His own will forgive us. The Lord manages it Himself. We need not worry. Our intention should not be insincere. To attain the Lord is our sincere intention. And then amidst it, if the importance is given to the honour, praise, repute and physical comports, it is the fault of the intention. Whenever the honour and dignity is awarded if should not be welcomed even if the Lord may be annoyed. If you give honour to this it means that spiritual practice is not to attain the Lord but it is for the cause of honour and repute; because when the honour and repute is got, the man is puffed up with joy and he forgets the Lord. That is an obstacle in the attainment of the Lord—Considering it so it should be neglected. That what is hurdle in the Lord's attainment should be kicked out. If there is the spiritual practice for the Lord's attainment, the gold, charming lady, repute honour will not obstruct us. If the spiritual practice is not respected it means our intention is not of the high category. The hypocrites charm others to make the false show of devotion-meditation and start getting themselves worshipped and served. When he starts accepting the worship he becomes the slave of worship and not the servant of the Lord. He who surrenders himself under the control of his wife is the servant of his wife and not the servant of the Lord. If he had been the slave of the Lord he would have defied them. Many seekers make the practice of deep meditation to sit at any open place to show others and when they are in any solitary place the rosary sometimes falls down from their hand and sometimes they fall asleep, because there is none to see him and outside in the open place he makes the practice only to show others. The Lord doesn't come there because he is a cheater. The Lord keeps Himself far away from such persons. If anyone is fond of the Lord from the inner self and it is getting delay in the Lord's arrival. There should be sorrow in the inner self why the Lord didn't come till then, what is the matter? O Lord! Practically If you don't come, what condition will be mine, I will be dead. No one else is my supporter except you. Such sentiment should be in the mind.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever worship and meditation is done is done—the Lord is not attained by such words of satisfaction. If our time is not passing properly then the effort should be made to pass the time properly. When the teeth decay, the face becomes wrinkled, it becomes difficult to walk, to sit and stand what will be then improvement in us? At present have you the time under your hands? It is not sure when the death may attack. When we may depart from this ocean of the world. If the death arrives will you  ask her to come the next day instead of today? Who will listen to you? Then, the property also will be left here with your body. No relation with anyone will, then, remain. The contact with the family even will be no more then. Only the vital air, sense organs, mind and reason—these are only that will go with you. Having left this gross body here you will depart through the subtle body. In your whole life you should get only that wealth with which you may purchase the Lord. If the God is not achieved in this life, the capital will remain with you already, it means the capital of your devotional song and meditation, the muttering what you have practised will remain in balance already. In the next birth you will be born as a man who has strayed from the 'Yoga-Path' and then you will attain the salvation. It is difficult to attain the Lord in any other class of birth. The human class of birth will be got only when you go astray from Yoga-Path. The Lord is asking Arjun—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अयतिः श्रद्धयोपेतो योगाच्चलितमानसः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अप्राप्य योगसंसिद्धिं कां गतिं कृष्ण गच्छति ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 6/37)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun said: Krishna, what becomes of the aspirant who, though endowed with faith, has not been able to subdue his passions, and whose mind is, therefore, diverted from Yoga (at the time of death), and who thus fails to reach perfection in 'Yoga' (God-realization)?'</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord answers—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">पार्थ नैवेह नामुत्र विनाशस्तस्य विद्यते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">न हि कल्याणकृत्कश्चिद‍्दुर्गतिं तात गच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 6/40)</p>
<p class="Text">'Shri Bhagawan Said—Dear Arjun, there is no fall for him either here or hereafter. For none who strives for self-redemption. (i.e., God-realization) ever meets with evil destiny'.</p>
<p class="Text">The doer of virtuous works never meets with evil destiny. After Death instead of going to the heaven he is born in the abode of 'Yogis' this is also not an easy job, even among the lacs there are rare one or two who are such. The enlightened men are called 'Yogi', having taken birth there he also starts practising the same conduct of the 'Yogis', and then, he succeeds in attainting the Lord. That is only the real wealth by the power of which he is born in the family of the 'Yogi'. That is the spiritual exercise practiced with good intention. If you pass this life with pious mind and wisdom the Lord will be attained in next birth. In this very birth there will be gain of fifteen annas then there will be no rebirth onward.</p>
<p class="Text">The purity of sense organ should be maintained. What is the purity of the eyes? To see the mothers and sisters with sacred eyes. Consider women which are elder to you as your mother and if similar to your age consider her as your sister. To view Lord in all is the special purity of our eyes.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">वासुदेवः सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 7/19)</p>
<p class="Text">'In the very last of all births the enlightened person worships Me, realizing that all this is God, such a great soul is very rare, indeed'.</p>
<p class="Text">In the very last of all births the enlightened person attains My state. But the pious soul who considers that Vasudeva is omnipresent is very rare. We have all already passed through a number of births. If we succeed to attain the Lord in this very birth, this will be our last birth. If we assume all as forms of God, and we serve all considering them the form of God then, our hands may become pious. Our ears are purified by hearing the talks of Lord's attributes, glory and love. Our ears are defiled by hearing worldly talks. By collecting the vices if we take them along with us, we will be recorded like phonogram (Tape recorder). We should have the higher sentiment like <span class="char-style-override-4">वासुदेव: सर्वमिति</span> 'Vasudeva is All.' None should be abused. By abusing anyone, by reproach, by false speech our tongue is defiled. These impressions accompany us after death. If by tongue the self-study of the Lord's Name, His attributes are practised our tongue is highly purified and if so we will get redemption in this very birth. </p>
<p class="Text">If our sense-organs are purified here in this world, the salvation will be possible here, otherwise the Lord will be attained in the next birth. If we filled our tongue with the filth and dirt we will have to fall into hell. We will get such species of birth where the attainment of the Lord will become impossible. Our effort should be so sincere and fast that we may attain the Lord in this very birth. Whatever capabilities we have all should be invested in the attainment of the Lord otherwise we will have to repent a lot. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सो परत्र दुःख पावइ सिर धुनि धुनि पछिताइ। </p>

<p class="Text">'He suffers torture in the other world and beats his head in remorse, wrongly attributing the blame to Time, Fate and God'.</p>
<p class="Text">Having the consideration of all this in mind we should not leave any stone unturned to attain the Lord. This is in our great interest, it should never be left. There is no other interest better than this. You remain roaming about because you could not get perfect joy. When the man is satisfied perfectly with that joy, nothing appeals to his nature. When he gets saturated with that bliss he need nothing if the whole body is cut into pieces, if it is burnt to ashes but the condition of the joy will remain continuing as it is. This is the test.</p>

We have already neglected it, so we remain deprived of <span class="char-style-override-4">कर्तुं सुसुखं</span>. 'It is very easy to do'. He may be the vilest inner but he turns to be pious very soon. The Lord says—</p>

<p class="Text">'He who has mastered his senses, is exclusively devoted to his practice and is full of faith, attains Knowledge; having had the revelation of Truth, he immediately attains Supreme peace in the form of God-realization.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord himself has given the clues of his attainment at many places. There is not the reason of delay. You say that number of years of your practice of spiritual discipline passed but you could achieve no object. You may call my words a lie, in reality you did not make practice. If you want valuable object you effort should also be valuable. You consider it difficult but the Lord says that it is very easy to do. The fruit is also apparent, it is not so that you do it today and you will get its fruit in the next birth.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम्। </p>

<p class="Text">'The knowledge (of both the Nirgun and Sagun aspects of divinity) is a sovereign science, a sovereign secret, Supremely holy, most excellent, directly enjoyable, attended with virtue, very easy to practise and imperishable'.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord says to Arjun—'You are the dearest to Me, so I tell you. Otherwise what was the need to the Lord? One may be the vilest sinner, as the soap cleans the most dirty cloths, similarly such is the power in the knowledge that purifies the sinners. The result also comes before the eyes as the food satisfies the appetite, the water quenches the thirst. The appetite and thirst are satisfied once but again the need is created, but this is imperishable. For this, no hard labour is required also. If you consider it hard, it is your foolishness. Having faith in the words of God we should engage ourselves in spiritual practice and should determine that either we would attain God or die forsaking life-breath. </p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. Ashadh Shukla 2, Samvat 2001 (Year 1944), Noon, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">All the beautiful and charming bodies are to be reduced to ashes or dust one day. If the death comes today it will perish to ashes today. No one will even touch those ashes. Whatever the flesh and bones are in the body all will burn to ashes, nothing will remain of use. So, so long as it is not burnt to ashes maximum use of it should be made. Now it can be used for the best work. There are thousands of times when this body has been burnt to ashes, and this body is also to face the same result. Such a handsome and valuable body which is to be burnt to ashes cannot be got even after paying one lakh of rupees. What a foolishness it is not to take work from it after death it becomes worthless, nobody will keep it even in the house. So the body must be used in the practice of much work. This is intelligence. We hire the motor for the whole day. We paid its fare, now make its maximum use. He who does not use it is a fool. As there is coal in a field, and that field was taken for one year contract, now, as much coal is taken out of it that is ours because we will lose our right after one year. Similarly, so long as this body is in existence there should be its maximum utilization. Here, also it is very valuable to practise the adoration, meditation and religious congregation. Even the gem has no value as compared to them, so the benefit should be taken from this body. Take such benefit that you may be happy forever. At present we are burning day and night. As the smaller patty (Pakaura) simmers in the boiling oil, similarly we remain burning, this sorrow, worry, fear anguish should be given up forever. The Lord has blessed us with wisdom, intelligence, discrimination and knowledge, we should take advantage of these. We are feeling grieved excursively, we should be completely bereft of this sorrow and that can be possible only in human body. That what became past passed away, the coming sorrow should be negated and that can be possible only in the human body. Foolishness is the mother of sorrow, the foolishness is due to ignorance and the ignorance in destroyed by knowledge and knowledge comes from the purity of inner-self. So, we should make the practice of devotional song, meditation and association with great souls. So that our inner self may be purified. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>—</p>

<p class="Text">At the time of death or after the death this should be managed. Whether he is young or old, his death is worth appreciating if he dies in this way hearing the chant of divine name. As Bhishmji abandoned his body on the bank of Gangaji. This is a matter of great joy. </p>
<p class="Text">At the time of death in the outer efforts this is the best effort to make the dying man listen either the chanting of the Lord's name or Gitaji. If he himself has anchored himself in God or His name or Gitaji, it is quite benedictory. His purpose is accomplished if any one dies hearing the Name of Narayan.</p>

God knows what will be the Time of death, so we should always contemplate upon the Lord. May our life pass away but the Lord should not be forgotten. If has been stated in the Gitaji for the constant adoration and meditation of the Lord.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः॥</p>

<p class="Text">'Arjun, whosoever always and constantly thinks of Me with undivided mind, to that Yogi ever absorbed in Me I am easily attainable.'</p>
<p class="Text">By the regular and constant thinking of the Lord, the Lord is easily attainable. If the God is attained the life is fulfilled. The first point is that there is no certainty of the life of the body, if the body was departed without the adoration and meditation of the Lord, it is not known what can be the limit of downfall. The Lord has stated in Gitaji—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(8/6)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, thinking of whatever entity one leaves the body at the time of death, that and that alone one attains, being ever absorbed in its thought.'</p>
<p class="Text">If at the time of death animal comes in my memory, it is the animal what will be the class of birth as Jada Bharat Muni was born as a deer. The last time is not known, so don't allow any opportunity so that any other object may come to your mind. </p>
<p class="Text">One person named Gokul Chand was ill, he died today. He had the articles of worth twenty-five or thirty thousands rupees and some cash with him, the police took him away. While alive If he had invested that money in any noble work what a noble deed of welfare would have been done. Everyone has to face the same situation, so long as the death is away, you should complete the work what is to be done.</p>
<p class="Text">This money and this body both are to be divorced from you. Union is sure to result in disunion, then why to keep possession over them. You have none as your own except the Lord. Wife, son etc., are to abandon you. It is better for you to give them up beforechand. You may do your best but nothing will go with you. Even this body is not to accompany you. Death is inevitable in spite of your best efforts this body is not to survive. So this body and property must be used for best work, so long as you have right, maximum advantage should be taken. This is called wisdom. As Gokulchand went away. In the same way you may not have to repent, you may not have to weep in the end. Only remember God alone nothing else. Keep the Lord in your remembrance considering the Lord's grace on you, never forget the Lord, keep Him in memory  and then your purpose is accomplished. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/5) </p>
<p class="Text">"He who departs from the body, thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state, there is no doubt about it;</p>
<p class="Text">So, the constant worship of the Lord should be made, it is not known when the death may come. We are touring about in the jocund company. If the cholera breaks out it will take six to twelve hours only that you will pass away. This is our condition you cannot check that you don't want cholera. As the rats move about, suddenly the cat catches it in clutch, similarly, the death is at watch. It will catch you abruptly. So we should always keep death in our mind. Narayan Swami says only to remind us of this fact</p>
<p class="SHLOK">दो बातनको भूल मत जो चाहत कल्यान। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नारायण इक मौतको दूजे श्रीभगवान॥</p>
<p class="Text">'If you are interested in your salvation don't forget the two realities, the first one death and the second is almighty Lord.'</p>
<p class="Text">By keeping in memory the death first no sin is committed and the Lord always remains in our mind. If you fail to do the virtuous deeds, it matters little, at last don't commit any sin and remain remembering the Lord, then, there is no doubt in your redemption. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सुत दारा और लक्ष्मी पापीके भी होय। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">संत मिलन अरु हरि भजन दुर्लभ जगमें दोय॥</p>
<p class="Text">They are the sinners also who remain well off with son, wife and wealth but the company of the saints and the chanting of the Lord's Bhajan are the two things what are rarely obtainable in this world. The crop of the Lord's devotion is getting deserted, it maintains its greenery by the communion of the saints. So company of saints must be done.</p>
<p class="Text">If these two principles of action are observed by you it is well and good, if not possible this then do observe only one remember the Lord constantly at every moment It can serve your all purposes. Maharshi Patanjali, says—the muttering of the Lord's Name and the meditation of the Lord's form should be performed by doing so all the obstacles are removed. The Lord states in the Gitaji—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते मामनन्यभाक्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">साधुरेव स मन्तव्यः सम्यग्व्यवसितो हि सः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(9/30) </p>
<p class="Text">'Even if the vilest sinner worships Me with exclusive devotion, he should be reckoned a saint, for he has rightly resolved. (He is positive in his belief that there is nothing like devoted worship of God) Tulasidasaji also states in <span class="char-style-override-3">Ramayana</span>—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जबहिं नाम हिरदे धरॺो भयो पापको नास। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मानो चिनगी अग्नि की परी पुरानी घास॥</p>
<p class="Text">'The moment anyone remembers the Lord's Name from his inner self with full faith his all the sins are washed away just as the spark of fire if falls down into the heap of dry grass, burns the entire into ashes.'</p>
<p class="Text">To think of the Lord constantly enables us to attain the Lord with guarantee. In the end it is verily certain, it may be possible earlier even. We do chant his name. The chanting should be with love. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">केशव केशव कूकिये न कूकिये असार। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रात दिवस के कूकते कबहुँ तो सुने पुकार॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Make the chanting of the Lord's Name (Keshava) devotedly with love but we should not chant trash. By the chanting of day and night it is sure that there will be a moment when it will be heard to the Lord.'</p>
<p class="Text">This was common what I said, now something special is stated here—</p>
<p class="Text">Reaching home we should give that treatment of love to all. There is only one thing and that is the sacrifice of selfishness. The Love is created by the sacrifice of selfishness is such a quality that attracts everyone. This is the charming spell, it has the supernatural power to take others under sway. By the sacrifice of self interest there is the natural creation of love. We should learn it by heart, it provides us the supernatural benefit. So long as you remain attached with enjoyments and comforts your liberation can never be possible. So long as you desire for enjoyment and comfort you will remain far away from the Lord. You could not attain the Supreme Being till today. The desire of the enjoyment and comfort is its root cause. These only are the obstacles in attainment of the Lord. These are the hindrance in the spiritual practice. Due to this, there is lack in love only due to this. So, if there is the need of the Lord's attainment, you will have to give up these. The mind is single whether you fix it on God or engage it in the worldly enjoyments.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कबिरा मन तो एक है भावे जहाँ लगाय। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भावै हरिकी भक्ति कर भावै विषय गमाय॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Kabiradasji states that we have single mind, it is our function to concentrate it wherever we like, either to engage it in the devotion of the Lord or to the worldly enjoyments, it is our lookout.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatsoever it may be, the mind must be concentrated to the Lord. It is a must.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मन फुरना से रहित कर जौने वििध से होय। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">चाहे भक्ति चाहे ज्ञानसे चाहे योगसे खोय॥</p>
<p class="Text">Make your mind free from the thought of the worldly affairs by any means whatever may be possible for you, whether it is by the means of devotion or knowledge or by Yoga practice.</p>
<p class="Text">"The Yoga practice or the path of knowledge, the both are very difficult in the present time. So, it is advised to adopt the path of devotion. One should become mad in the love of the Lord and then experience the ecstatic state. The Lacs of times more joy and pleasure is felt in the renunciation then that of the worldly enjoyments and prosperity. When you grow higher, the indifference to the world created in the mind, then, the joy is multiplied. When the mind is concentrated in the deep meditation of the Lord, the category of that joy is quite different and what to talk of that happiness when the Lord is attained. The Lord's attainment is not even difficult the Lord says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 7/14)</p>
<p class="Text">'For, this most wonderful Maya (veil) of mine, consisting of the three Gunas (modes of Nature) is extremely difficult to break through; those, however, who constantly adore me alone, are able to cross it.'</p>
<p class="Text">So, leaving even the most urgent works we should do only that for which we are blessed with this body. There was no work in this World which we did not do but remained deprived of the Lord till now, this work is to be completed. Having got the human body to concentrate the mind in the sensual objects is our foolishness. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नर तनु पाइ बिषयँ मन देहीं। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पलटि सुधा ते सठ बिष लेहीं॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Shriramcharitmanas, Uttar.</span> 44/2)</p>
<p class="Text">'The fools who devote their mind to the pleasures of sense even after attaining human birth take poison in exchange for nectar.' </p>
<p class="Text">The Supreme Lord is nectar, the pleasures of the senses are poison. By taking poison one dies only once but by taking the poison of sensuous pleasures he remains revolving in the cycle of death and birth again and again. So, the nectar of the Lord should be taken. This is the main point. After departing from here and reaching home after taking the bath, the Sandhya, the recitation of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> and meditation of the Lord should be practised daily without any break, and the mental adoration of the Lord should be performed. Either Sakar or Nirakar form of God any one should be meditated. In the morning and in the evening both the times the Lord's name should be muttered along with meditation of God and always keeping the Lord in the mind the worldly duties should be done. Adoration and meditation should become our diet. It should be determined in the mind to worship and mediate the Lord, even at the cost of life. For the meditation the morning and evening are the most appropriate times. If the picture of this banyan tree Satsanga Swargashrama is visualized in the mind the feeling of renunciation can be created in the inner self. The chanting of the devotional song and meditation of the Lord should be performed with great love and devotion. If a man sings the devotional song being overwhelmed with love the Lord is pleased. Similarly the muttering of 'Gayatri' and 'Sandhya' should be performed with love but their mind moves about somewhere else, so you are not attaining the Lord. </p>
<p class="Text">The 'Sun' is the manifest God. We should feel the same peace and joy from the sight of the sun as from the sight of God. It requires nothing to do but it requires only to change our sentiment and mentality. The Philosopher's stone is lying there at the home and we have formed a false idea that it is merely a stone, so we are starving. Any pious soul saw this stone and said—'you can make the whole world rich' and he asked—'what is this?' He said—'This is a stone. I prepare sauce by crushing with it'. The Mahatma said—I don't take it as stone, it is the philosopher's stone, if you have iron in your house bring it. He brings, the Mahatma made the touch of that iron with the stone and that iron turned to gold. Now, will he use it for crushing to prepare sauce? He had been suffering from poverty for so many days, it was merely his foolishness only. The same case is with us the Lord is present inside us, but we don't accept it. If any Mahatma comes and brings it in your understanding our purpose will be served. In the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>, the Lord states—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मत्तः स्मृतिर्ज्ञानमपोहनं च। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">वेदैश्च सर्वैरहमेव वेद्यो </p>
<p class="SHLOK">वेदान्तकृद्वेदविदेव चाहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(15/15)</p>
<p class="Text">'It is I who remain seated in the hearts of all creatures as the inner controller of all; and it is I who am the source of memory, knowledge, and the ratiocinative faculty. </p>
<p class="Text">Again, I am the only object worth knowing through the Vedas' I alone am the origin of Vedanta and Knower of the Vedas, too.'</p>
<p class="Text">There is Knowledge in your heart, what is this? This is the form of the Lord. We should follow the practice of devotional song and meditation regularly and with great reverence Ignoring the lacs of works we should do this work on the priority basis.</p>
<p class="Text">The devotees of the Lord sometimes laugh and sometimes weep, and sometimes they dance. When the devotees think of the mercy and of the Lord and His attributes and glory he laughs. When he looks towards his sins he weeps. The devotees feel it—Lord! I am the vilest sinner, can my salvation also be possible? Everyone is successful in gaining his object at the door of the Lord. It is not so that the Lord emancipates only them who are His lovers, He is the friend of all the meeks, the purifier of all the down fallen. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord proves himself just who regards him as just and not kind for him He is only just. The purpose of the man who thinks that the Lord is already just but kind also, is served at once very soon. There should be our understating that the Lord is full of mercy and then, our worry, fear, grief stay no longer. We should always chant the Lord's name. Sometimes we should feel delighted to realize the Lord's attributes, glory, and mystery. We should be gay to get the bird's eye view of the Lord's mercy, how compassionate is the Lord to me.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जाकर कृपा राम की होई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तापर कृपा करै सब कोई॥</p>
<p class="Text">'All are compassionate to him who is graced by Lord's mercy.'</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the joy or sorrow we are experiencing or experience, that is full of the Lord's mercy, so always look forward to the Lord's compassion. Whatever befalls unwillingly or by the will of others, that is divine offering and award of the Lord, who always remains intoxicated in love of the Lord, kicks out the entire prosperity of the world. We should have our goal to become such that our sight and speech may do the highest good to the people. We should have such a sentiment. Our salvation is not a big question. We should always make our mind for the redemption of all and Sundry. How many times we became Indra but we could not attain the Lord till now. So leaving everything aside we should remember the Lord. This is the root of all kinds of spiritual practice. If it is not possible then, repeat the Lord's Name only. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम राम जपते रहो जब लगि घटमें प्रान। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कबहुँ तो दीनदयालके भनक परैगी कान॥</p>
<p class="Text">Remain repeating the Lord's Name so long as there is life in you. It is dead sure there will be a moment when your words will reach the ears of the Lord! Well! What is an other work to do in the whole day and night. So long as there is vital air in the body, this is what is to be done.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">काल भजन्ता आज भज आज भजन्ता अब। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पलमें परलय होयगी बहुरि भजेगा कब॥</p>
<p class="Text">'What you propose for the tomorrow to remember the Lord's Name, do it today and what is proposed for today do it at once. Never postpone it for future. If suppose, there is annihilation to-day then when will you get the time to remember the Lord's Name.'</p>
<p class="Text">With the consideration of these facts in your mind the Lord's name should be repeated constantly determine in your mind to mutter Lord's name by your speech, His meditation in your mind and determine the existence of the Supreme. Being by your intellect. When you reach this conviction that the Lord is omnipresent, then no sin will be committed by you. As here is the rule of the government, we cannot speak against her. The government is not even such a power but the Supreme Being is omnipresent and omnipotent. So, we should always contemplate on the Lord every moment. We should look the vision of the Lord everywhere always every moment. I have told you the gist. </p>
<p class="Text">While listening to the sermon it should be heard with the attentive mind that the words of the sermon are to be brought in practice and are to be propagated after hearing propagate it and then see how beneficial it is. </p>
<p class="Text">Reaching home always go through the spiritual books. One should read and other should hear. It should be propagated among your friends in the city.  It should be publicised in the schools and the libraries. By doing so you may progress in a small period. Such opportunity is not available to you again and again. First, it is very difficult to get human body, because there are uncounted creatures, The Lord will provide them also the opportunity. Human body is not easily obtainable and even the more unobtainable is the company of the enlightened souls. It is very difficult to reach them. If anyhow, they are got even, it is difficult to distinguish them. The time is passing very fast, one and half hour passed only in no time. Kabirdasji has Stated—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कबिरा नौबत आपनी दिन दस लेहु बजाइ। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यह पुर पट्टन यह गली बहुरि न देखहु आइ॥ </p>
<p class="SHLOK">आज काल की पाँच दिन जंगल होगा बास। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">ऊपर ऊपर हल फिरै ढोर चरेंगे घास॥</p>
<p class="SHLOK"> मरोगे मर जाओगे कोई न लेगा नाम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">उज्जड़ जाय बसाओगे छोड़ बसंता गाम॥</p>
<p class="Text">Kabirdasji says that this life is short lived. In that short span of life you may do whatever you like but this village, this town or this place where you are born will be invisible to you again. After this life of a few days you will abide in the forest. The plough will turn over land where body is cremated and the animals will graze grass. It is certain you will die one day and everyone will forget you, none will remember even your name and thus, having left this world of your enjoyments you will reside in forest!</p>
<p class="Text">You will abide in the forest, people will take you to the cremation ground and burn you to ashes.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">हाड़ जलै ज्यूँ लाकड़ी केस जले ज्यूँ घास।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सब जग जलता देख कर भया कबीर उदास॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Your bones will burn just as the woods burn in the fire and your hair will burn as the dry grass viewing all the people burning, Kabir felt melancholy'</p>

<p class="SHLOK">दो पाटनके बीचमें साबत बचा न कोय॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Viewing the grinding mill whirling Kabir wept. Between the two mill-stones none survives.'</p>
<p class="Text">The time wheel is running. The death is inevitable. Everyone is passing away serial wise. You are also in this que. Now, where is left the time? See towards your age, what is the guarantee of life-time? </p>
<p class="Text">Now, beating of drum resounds to march. Make yourself ready to depart from this world. <span class="char-style-override-4">अब कूच नगारा बजता है, चलनेकी फिकर करो बाबा!</span>  As you are ready to start for your village, similarly you should be always ready to leave this world. Be ready to purchase the ticket of your journey. What is this to purchase the ticked and remain prepared that is to attain the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Having blessed with such a valuable human body the Lord says—<span class="char-style-override-4">मां भजस्व।</span> Remember Me, 'repeat My Name.' Even after spending a lac of money you cannot survive even a single minute more. Your lac of works will remain pending. When the messengers of the Lord Yama reach they will not wait. The police constables come with warrant, they can give you time by taking the bribe, but there is no meaning of the bribe, in such a condition then, we should remain alert. In the 'terrible Kaliyuga' there is no other way like the Lord's devotion. For the devotion of the Lord there in no other way but to remember Him, so never forget him. The Lord is always with us, think him so or in the formless concept he is omnipresent, He is in each and every particle and He appears by virtue of his love. The easy way of love is the muttering of the Lord's name, the meditation of his image and the association of the noble men, if all these three are there then it is very good. Even the single one of these three can also serve our purpose.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord States—</p>

<p class="Text">'Therefore, fix your mind on Me, and establish your intellect in Me alone; Thereafter you will abide solely in Me, There is no doubt about it.'</p>
<p class="Text">We should make it clear in our mind that making Arjun as medium the Lord has given sermon of the Gitaji for us—each and everyone. The gist of the sermon of gita is to love all without any selfish motive. Tulasidasji states—There are only two who love selflessly, the first one is the Lord and the second one is the dear and loving devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">हेतु रहित जग जुग उपकारी। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तुम्ह तुम्हार सेवक असुरारी॥ </p>

<p class="Text">'You two are the only selfless benefactors in this world—Yourself and your servant, O Destroyer of the demons, everyone else in this world has his own interest to serve; no one thinks of other's highest (Spiritual) interests even in a dream, O Lord'.</p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Shriramcharitmanas, Kishkindha.</span> 12/2)</p>
<p class="Text">'Gods, men and sages, all as a rule have some selfish motive behind their love.'</p>
<p class="Text">Keeping all this in our mind we should love everyone with unselfish motive. Then, you will come to glitter. As a Chaste woman attains the Lord by serving her husband, similarly we will also attain the Lord by service of the common public with unselfish motive. </p>
<p class="Text">One may be the fool of the highest category and the vilest sinner but he can also attain the Lord. If we have faith in the Gitaji, in the Mahatmas (great souls), We should constantly contemplate the Lord every moment. The redemption of even the vilest sinner can be possible even today. There is only one condition, he should remember the Lord from today till his death. </p>
<p class="Text">Only by communion with great souls, one can get emancipation. For this God says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्ये त्वेवमजानन्तः श्रुत्वान्येभ्य उपासते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तेऽपि चातितरन्त्येव मृत्युं श्रुतिपरायणाः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 13/25)</p>
<p class="Text">'Other dull-witted persons, however, not knowing thus, worship even as they have heard from others (i.e. the knower's of truth) and even they who are thus devoted to what they have heard, are able to cross the ocean of mundane existence in the shape of death.'</p>
<p class="Text">Discipline of knowledge, (Gyanayoga), Yoga of meditation (Dhyanayoga), Discipline of action (Karmayoga) are verily the cause of our deliverance, but the dull-witted persons also shape their conduct and practice accordingly as they have heard from others (the knower's of truth) are able to attain God-hood. Thus, our salvation becomes possible by remembering the Lord's Name only also. Even the vilest sinner gets Divinity by attending the assembly of great souls. Tulasidasji says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तात स्वर्ग अपबर्ग सुख धरिअ तुला एक अंग। </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-21">The dispassion from the world and love to the Lord*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Morning, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">The renunciation here is but natural. It is much beneficial here if the matter of renunciation is dealt with by the renunciant. I have to translate only the Words uttered by the Lord and Mahatmas (exalted souls). The topic of the love and devotion to the Lord is very profound, from where to bring the love? If it is sold anywhere then, I should bring it therefrom.  </p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रेम न बाड़ी नीपजे प्रेम न हाट बिकाय।</p>
<p class="Text">'The love is neither produced in the field nor is it sold in the market.' </p>
<p class="Text">It is only the Lord on number one who knows the essence of love. The second number is of the devotees of the Lord who know it, but they also cannot express it in words. This subject is like <span class="char-style-override-4">‘मुकास्वादनवत्’.</span> 'The taste for the dumb is inexpressible.' </p>
<p class="Text">The renunciation in the world and love to the Lord  are a very good thing to say. In the present time we have love to the world and detachment from the Lord—this is quite reverse. What should be done? Every point of the version should be reversed. After the detachment from the world indifference to the world automatically results. By the love to the Lord, the mediation to the Lord goes on automatically. Here, the feeling of renunciation should be originated without any effort. Here, the woods, mountains and Gangaji these three are only visible. This is a holy place and here it is seclusion also. For the meditation this is an appropriate place. As if devotion, knowledge and renunciation were raining here. If our life is ended here is the state of meditation it means we have crossed the ocean of life and death. If the opportunity of death is got, then, one should be intoxicated in meditation of the Supreme Lord. Then, this life may depart. At that time if hue and cry in created, it will lead to hell.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/5)</p>
<p class="Text">'He who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state; there is no doubt about it.'</p>
<p class="Text">Learn it by heart the sense of this verse. Even the vilest sinner, mean, atheist all get deliverance, Remember the Lord if there is any indication as hiccup, belch  sneeze or any other indication of death and remain waiting for the death every moment. Markandeya Muni worshipped the Lord Shiv. When the Lord Yama reached with the noose. Mankandeyaji at once caught the hold of the Stone phallus of the Lord Shiv. The Lord Yama went back empty handed being shy. We have the last resort of Hari's Name. 'When you are disappointed seek shelter to the Lord. Draupadi remembered the Lord at the time when she was being undressed forcibly in the open assembly the Lord protected her. Remember the Lord always in your mind. The Lord follows the devotee's approach that the Lord also remembers him always who remembers the Lord always. Make the practice of remembering the Lord every moment, it will enhance the renunciation and if the renunciation is enhanced the practice will also increase without any effort. It is very easy to mutter the Lord's name. The practice is in your hands. Mutter the Lord's name with your tongue. Breathing is constant, mutter the lord's Name through this. The breathing continues till death, so it is mostly possible in the natural way to remember the Lord's Name at the time of death. The muttering of Name through breath is the easiest means. Indifference to the world is natural when there is renunciation. To detach the inner self and mind from the world is called 'Uparati'. The Lord has stated—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘असङ्गशस्त्रेण दृढेन छित्त्वा’</span> The roots of the world tree are well rooted and firm. So, to cut it the weapon should also be strong. What is to cut the world? To forget the world. What is to forget? To remain quite detached with the world. If there is complete indifference from the world there is the perfect peace then. In the state of meditation the perfect peace is the first step.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मनः संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्परः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 6/14)</p>
<p class="Text">'Firm in the Vow of complete chastity and fearless, keeping himself perfectly calm and with the mind held in restraint and fixed on Me, the vigilant Yogi should sit absorbed in Me.'</p>
<p class="Text">Holding the trunk straight and steady remaining firm if one is seated on such a place then one gets naturally absorbed in meditation. If you die thinking of this world you will be forced to take rebirth in this world. Jadbharat was the ascetic of the highest category, but at the moment of death deer came to his memory and so he had to take the next birth as a deer. There is the sudden arrival of death keeping this in your mind remember the Lord always. The intoxication of renunciation is super natural, it is not like the passionate intoxication. You will experience it when you get it. If you want to be addicted of intoxication, then be addicted of the intoxication of the renunciation, this is Sattvika, it distracts from the world and it helps in the automatic meditation of the Lord.</p>

<p class="Text">By the muttering of Name the object Named comes to our memory and by the memory of the Name our Purpose is served. In a moment means by remembering in the end of life we get the deliverance. How nice it is if our redemption becomes possible by remembering only one Name. On one side as man finished his whole property by spending it in the performance of Yagyas, Charity, donation etc., and on the other side the second man remembered Shri Hari's Name in the end of life at the time of death, out of the both the man who remembered the Lord's Name in the end of his life is much better; because he who has done the noble deeds of charity donation etc., takes the birth again in this transient world when the capital of his auspicious deeds gets exhausted.

May I have the exclusive love in You, If love is not possible, may I contemplate You at least, so we should remain absorbed is the contemplation of the Lord always. Even while we are in movement. The Name is helpful to remember the Lord; so at least in twenty four hours with the 21,600 (Twenty-one thousand six hundreds) breaths what we take in the twenty-four hours of day and night according to the beads of rosary we should mutter the Lord's Name at least twenth-one thousand six hundreds on beads 'Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare. Hare Krishna hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare' and we should think over and start it from today. Even on this land of this world he who engages himself in worship and spiritual discipline for the Lord is entitled of the highest fruit. Here, the charity should be donated to the poor, destitute and the orphans who are deserving. In the ' Yagyas' the 'Jap Yagya' (sacrifice by repeating name) in adoration) is at the top, so we should mutter name. To give due welcome to saints, the study of the 'Shastras' should continue to be practised day and night. This is the work of the highest category. In the past the people who used to come here performed only the virtuous deeds. The time passed, is passed away. We should now, make our future bright and delightful.

<p class="Text">So, several very important topics had been discussed in the night. If a man believes that his redemption will be there at the time of death—this is the superficial presumption. That is what is the solid base should be practised to Remember the Lord constantly every moment. </p>
<p class="Text">In the end if the man dies thinking of the Lord, the deliverance becomes possible, this is right—</p>

<p class="Text">But what is the proof with you that you will remember the Lord when you depart from this body at the time of death is it dead sure? If the faith is perfect there is no need of the proof of any Shastras or reasons. The Lord gave the proof of Shashtra—</p>

<p class="Text">By quoting the proof of the Vedas' Smritis the Lord assured to make Arjun confident. It is right that if any one thinks of the Lord at the time of death he gets deliverance. There should be the strength of any support in the hands of man. In the last time first there is the priority of the 'Sapta Puri' (holy places). If there  remains the stay, there the salvation will be attained. This is the glory of the place. If you depend on it, this is one of the ways.  </p>
<p class="Text">Likewise the muttering of the Lord's Name and the meditation of his form—this is also very powerful prop. Only that man who remains constantly absorbed in worshipping God can say confidently that there is no doubt about his deliverance because the Lord says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः।</p>

<p class="Text">Whosoever makes such spiritual efforts he attains God earlier his death, the Lord is attained to him too earlier. To remember the Lord always and constantly—this is the solid base. The emancipating Lord reaches there first, there is no need to wait for the last time.</p>
<p class="Text">There must be some strength of any kind. The second is the residence at any holy place of Pilgrimage. There are some who live at Braj and some live at Kashi. This is their resolve to die there only and not to go anywhere else to leave that place—this is seeking shelter to the Pilgrimage. This is solid. </p>
<p class="Text">One is seeking shelter to the Yoga—as to go in deep meditation comes to his knowledge. When there comes the death he should sit in deep meditation. A Yogi has the strength of his Yogic practice.</p>
<p class="Text">There should be strength of Yoga, Pilgrimage or the Lord's remembrance. As there is the force of remembrance there should be the force of the mental memory of the Lord's name that is also very good. The Lord says—</p>

<p class="Text">If there is the knowledge of the Lord's integral being the knowledge of integral being is as vapour, cloud smoke, water and ice are all forms of water similarly Adhidevas Adhibhutas and Adhiyagya etc., are all forms of God let the wisdom be anchored into the Supreme Being. If he comes to know the absolute Truth with his mind and wisdom it can never be diverted. That is the state of spiritual discipline not of perfection, but whenever he dies at any time, there will be his deliverance. His mind and wisdom has merged into Him. </p>
<p class="Text">If it is not so even, if he has come to realize the identity of the Supreme Being in his mind with his knowledge well, this is the stage of earlier just before the attainment. That what has rooted in our mind can never go out of our mind. As anyone being meditates the Lord's attributed form, he tastes the sap of this form, he cannot give it up. As the Gopikas could never forget the Lord's form even though they wish to forget.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who has already tasted the nectar of the Lord's attributed form can never divert himself from that joy even if his neck is cut. This is a great strength constantly thinking of whatever entity one lives his life that will come in his mind at the time of his death it is dead sure, this is the rule. He who thinks of the Lord only, he will see the sight of the Lord only in his dream. If even in his mental disorder he would speak about the Lord only. Tulasidasji States the glory of Name—</p>

<p class="Text">Such a Yogi has the strong force of Yogic practice. It has closed all the gates of sense organs and has established the mind in the cavity of the heart and has drawn the life breath to the head, and then has uttered the one Indestructible Brahma, OM.

<p class="Text">Here is the priority to the meditation of the Lord and muttering of His Name. Out of the above mentioned two verses there may not be the practice according to the first verse but even if the state according to the second verse is maintained, then also our purpose will be served. But in place of the second verse, if the condition is maintained according to the first verse only, then without  the remembrance of the Lord at the time of death there is no more gain. If you may practice the muttering and meditation of the Lord even escaping from the Yogic practice, this is a great strength with you and if you have this strength that is much better. </p>
<p class="Text">The second number is the Satsang, the association of the great souls. First there is the scarcity of the great souls in this world. The population of this country is supposed to be about forty crores of men. As I understand even forty seers of truth may be any how hardly available out of them it is also more than sufficient, If such exalted souls are even present but we are unable to distinguish them. If they dwell in the forest they are out of our reach. Out of forty crores probably, thirty nine crores would be householders, there would be renunciants near about one crore in number. There may be probably one great soul out of the crores. We get its glimpse from the Gitaji also— </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मनुष्याणां सहस्त्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 7/3)</p>
<p class="Text">'Hardly one among thousands of men strives to realize Me; of those striving Yogis, again, some rare one (devoting himself exclusively to Me) knows Me in reality.'</p>
<p class="Text">By this justification it is presumed that hardly one among the crores knows the Supreme Being. One among thousands makes efforts to attain the Supreme Lord. The rest run after money—eat, drink and be merry. They are to be born among the eighty four lakhs of the class of births. We have already taken lakhs and crores of births in each class of birth. Now, this cycle should be stopped at all. The cycle stops—in this human body and not in other class of birth. And even being bestowed with the human body if we passed our life like a dog in merely, eating, sleeping etc., then the scriptures would call fie upon us. Calamity after calamity is falling upon us even then, we don't try to check them. We weep when the sorrow visits us. It has become our nature to weep. Then, remain revolving in cycle of eighty four lakhs of classes of births.</p>
<p class="Text">But the question is how to know the exalted soul? By the grace of the Lord or if the enlightened souls want to make us known then we can know. Through reverence and faith we can know. If we pray to the Lord, He may serve our purpose. </p>
<p class="Text">Question—What is the criteria that we have already come to know the truth and mystery of the great soul? </p>
<p class="Text">Answer—He who comes to know the truth and secret of God and knows the essence of love, He is never devoid of love. One who knows the essence of meditation, never gives up meditation. Similarly he who comes to know the essence of the great soul never turns back from the great soul.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—He may not leave but if the great soul leaves him?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—No, this is the vow of the three—Dharma (religion), Mahatma and the God—whosoever holds them fast, then they never abandon him. This is also what the Shastra states—all the near and dear, kith and kins part away having left on the cremation ground but it is the Dharama (righteousness) only that accompanies. </p>
<p class="Text">Question—Does the God not accompany?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Why should the Lord go there the Lord, Himself, embracing him, already takes him away to His supreme abode first of all. It is his corpse that goes to the cremation ground. </p>
<p class="Text">Question—Does the Lord, Himself come to take away or send his courtiers? </p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Both are the possibilities, Sometimes He, Himself comes and sometimes He sends His courtiers. The messengers are called Courtiers. The intense lover who purchases the Lord with his love, the Lord, Himself comes there. If there is the support of meditation, then the messengers come. </p>
<p class="Text">Does the Lord Yama, himself also come? He does come, He, himself came in the case of Satyavana. Generally, his messengers come.</p>
<p class="Text">Similarly, they are the messengers of the Lord who come for them who are the strivers. The Lord, Himself, comes for these who are the liberated persons. He who realizes the enlightened well. Is never separated from the saint, By due to destiny, physically he may separate but internally there is no separation. The union through the inner self is the real union. If I have love for you, you may be thousands of miles far away even then you are very close to me. If there is no love, the discourse is going on, I am sitting just close, but they sleep. In the journey of Pilgrimage, the stranger is sitting near you, though being just beside you, still he is far away. This is what I told you about the glory of a great saint's association. </p>
<p class="Text">There is no doubt for his salvation who has the support of any one strength. We should get our purpose served on the base of any power before hand.  Whether it is by joining the company of saints, by Yoga or by love we can meet the God even before death.</p>
<p class="Text">Even though residing in the holy place of pilgrimage one abandons the place, why? If he leaves the pilgrimage. It means he didn't understand at all the value and secret of the holy place. In the similar way if anyone leaves the company of a saint he didn't understand the essence of the saint. If he gives up divine love it means he didn't understand the essence of that love. There is only one thing that is common everywhere in every case. If he knew the secret and essence he could not leave it. Can the greedy of money leave the money? If he is a saint, a renounced person he can ignore money. How can he who has love for money, give up money?	</p>
<p class="Text">It should be marked why Arjun kills Pitamah Bhishma and his family priest Dronacharya with his arrows, it is so because this is the command of the Lord Krishna. Even though obeying the command of Lord, Arjun has no lack of reverence for Bhishma in his mind. Having shot his arrow at Bhishma he bows at his feet. Bhishma said—'Bring the pillow.' The Kauravas etc., bring the pillows of velvet. Bhishma said—'Bring the pillow deserving me.' And looked towards Arjun. Having shot his arrow at his head Arjun lifted up his head. Bhishma got pleased and said to Arjun—'Blessed are you! If you had not provided me the pillow of such kind I would have cursed you.'</p>
<p class="Text">Then, Bhishma asked for water. All ran to him with the pot of fragrant water. Bhishma said—'This water is not suitable for me.' Arjun shot the arrow into the earth. The Gangaji came out breaking through the earth and the 'Gangajal' (water of the Ganga) began to fall into his mouth. Bhishmaji got sated.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-24">The Lord fulfils the desire of His Devotees*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. Jyeshth Shukla 5, Samvat 2002, Morning, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—This is stated in the <span class="char-style-override-3">Ramayana</span>—'Lord Ram always served the interest of His servants.' Was Angadaji not the servant of the Lord that He sent Angadaji from Ayodhya instead of keeping him with himself?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—The Lord always does serve the interest of His devotees. There must have been some subtle desire in him. The Lord is omniscient, He knows the mind of every one, Thinking to himself some lurking desire in him only He would have sent him to Kishkindha. Angad was not at all any burden on the Lord. Angad had his fonding for the position of prince, he had some attraction toward that side. The Lord always does right. The Lord had no shop of his own at Kishkindha to run that He would send him there. In the <span class="char-style-override-3">Valmiki Ramayana,</span> Ramaji asked—'Who can kill Lavanasura?' Shatrughnaji said—'I can kill him' the Lord sent him and made him the king of that place. The Lord knows each and everything. What he does he does it right. Similarly Sitaji Said—'I will view the sight of the sages going to the forest.' The Lord sent her with Lakshman for ever to the forest within a short time. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is omniscient. So, just knowing the inner desire the Lord fulfils it. Angad wanted to live in Kishkindha, so he had sent him there such a motive should be understood. </p>
<p class="Text">If Angada could not live without the Lord he would have requested him again. He had already the right of prayer. So, it seems that he was interested to live in Kishkindha. Whatever dispensation for some one God accords, that is good for him. 	</p>
<p class="Text">Let us take advantage from the Gitaji. Let the Gitaji circulate through the whole being. As Hanumanji got engrossed the every pore of his body with Rama's Name and got pervaded his entire being with Shri Rama's Name. Similarly the Gitaji should pervade our entire being also. There is no other scriputure like Gitaji at all. The Lord has stated in Gitaji— </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(8/5) </p>
<p class="Text">One who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains my state, there is no doubt about it!</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/7)</p>
<p class="Text">'Therefore, Arjun, think of Me at all times and fight, with mind and reason thus set on Me, you will doubtless come to Me.'</p>
<p class="Text">We should adopt the same in our case also. We should perform all our action remembering the Lord. In the tenth Skandha of '<span class="char-style-override-3">Bhagwata'</span> the reference has come—'The Gopies always remembered the Lord. They never forgot him even for a moment. Being compelled the Lord had to say—'No other devotee is so dear to Me like the Gopi.' He who sets his reason on Me he attains Me. He who dies thinking of Me only at the last time of death attains My state.</p>
<p class="Text">The death is inevitable but uncertain. It is not known when it may come. While journeying when may we fall on the railway line below the train to be crushed? What is certain when may we die by heart attack? So, when you think of the Lord every moment and mutter His name constantly you will be able to remember Him at the last moment of death also. By remembering his Name it is certain that we will attain the Lord's abode. If we are sure that we will be able to remember the Lord's Name at the time of death, it is not possible without practice. That what remains always in your memory, the same remains in your mind even at the time of death. The joy what we experience in the memory of the Lord cannot be possible in the worldly objects. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नर तनु पाइ बिषय मन देहीं। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">पलटि सुधा ते सठ बिष लेहीं॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Shriramcharitmanas, Uttar.</span> 44/2)</p>
<p class="Text">'The fools who devote their mind to the pleasures of sense even after attaining human birth take poison in exchange for nectar.'</p>
<p class="Text">We should rely on this chaupai of Tulasidasji. The fool who devotes his mind to the pleasures of senses, takes only poison in exchange for nectar. Where on one scale of balance the contemplation of the Lord and on the next scale worldly enjoyments. It is just like the comparison of an oilman to the king Bhoj. Where on one side Rama and on the other side prattling. Giving up one who is love personified and nectar itself who applies his mind to the pleasures of sense which are poison themselves, is a fool and takes poison in exchange for nectar.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">ताहि कबहुँ भल कहइ न कोई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">गुंजा ग्रहइ परस मनि खोई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Shriramcharitmanas, Uttar.</span> 44/3)</p>
<p class="Text">'None will ever speak well of him who picks up a peppercorn throwing away the philosopher's stone.' </p>
<p class="Text">The peppercorn glitters, the philosopher's stone looks mere stone. If both the objects are put before a child. He will prefer the peppercorn. Likewise those men are also like the children who demand peppercorn instead of philosopher's stone. The secret of the joy in the performing of adoration and meditation what is known by him only who remains in practice of it, the others don't' know this. What should we understand. The gods who drink nectar? They are only the gods who know it. Similar is this nectar.</p>
<p class="Text">If any one complains that there is no delight in the Lord's Name, so the mind does not get any interest there. It means he understands nothing.  Place an ant on small lump of the sugar. If it does' not taste it, it will not get any taste. Like the same we don't take interest in the Lord's Name, so we don't feel its joy also. We should lead a renounced life. We should know about renunciation. If we ask any prostitute about the renunciation what will she answer?</p>
<p class="Text">We should take the great souls as God. The saints have been stated to be assumed as God because whatever sermon they give to us that is all for our welfare. If that saint or the virtuous man is not true, the God will correct our mind. There is injustice here in this world but not so in the realm of God. If we consider others as God then we will get deliverance. We should depend on the Lord. We should weep to sit in a solitary place—O the Lord! If I am at fault correct me. If I am in the darkness set me right. Whatever the effort I make that is all for Your sake. I know nothing, it is only You who know. Relying on the Lord we should pray with the voice choked with emotion, and then to have faith in whatever command is received. At last I tell you a panacea to behave in practice according to the inspiration we get from the Lord by His prayer and if we act upon that inspiration our deliverance can be possible. What is to be achieved by the advice of a mortal man?   </p>
<p class="Text">Now, I tell you about the duty of a great soul. If an inquisitive person assumes him as God, Then that saint should oppose it strongly. If he does not perform his actions according to the ordains of Shastras, if he doesn't say so it means he cheats the others. This is the duty of a great soul that he should make his best efforts to check it. By doing so he will not be a culprit before the Lord. If he encourages and gets himself revered, he is not a great man. </p>
<p class="Text">I have been doing this work giving discourses for the last forty eight years. When I was  twenty years old. I had started this work since then. If you bring this in your practice in your practical life my labour will prove fruitful, What has been uttered to you that is logical and based on Shastras. If anyone assumes an enlightened soul as God, the saint must check it. If he doesn't check then he drags himself as well as his disciple both to fall into a pit. Those who have shown improper devotion have repented also. So, if anyone develops the feeling of divinity for any saint then it is the duty of saint himself to check him. If you consider me God and I encourage you it will give a very bad result. If I Check him how can he fall into a deep pit?</p>
<p class="Text">Question—If any one doesn't allow to accept </p>
<p class="Text">himself a Mahatma, a great soul how will we get deliverance?  </p>
<p class="Text">Answer—If anyone asks me to deposit his money even without any interest, it is better for me not to deposit his money. There lies my appreciation. If I deposit his money with me this is very bad. </p>
<p class="Text">To consider the self superior is the symbol of downfall. Reverance for him is dismissed automatically who gets himself worshipped. If we serve our mother-father and the preceptor and if they forbid, our regard to them increases more, it has a very good impact on others also. This is sacrifice. As much this sacrifice leaves the impact nothing has its so much impact, as much the sentiment of sacrifice one has so much superior he is. There should be the sacrifice of money, the sacrifice of luxuries and comports, the sacrifice of honour and repute and praise all these should be sacrificed. We talk of sacrifice for others but if we don't have the sentiment of self-sacrifice. As much superior he is. If I give only sermon to others to sacrifice honour, praise repute etc., and the others find its naught in me, they will develop hatred for me. Nowadays an orator has no impact on his audience because he lacks those qualifies himself what he advises for others.</p>
<p class="Text">I just usually quote only some instances from the legends of the devotees and some of the words uttered by Lord.  If I follow them in my own life that will be advantageous to me, if other one else also follows it he will be benefited. If I boast that I am such a great man, I possess those high virtues, none will accept me a great soul man. Self-praise should never be made, it does not have any impact on others. </p>
<p class="Text">Question—Should a woman pronounce 'Omkar OM' or not?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—A woman should never worship or pronounce 'Omkar' (OM) and the spell that includes 'OM' is also prohibited for women in the scriptures.  I only request for not to be pronounced. If anyone does not care for my request, I have no interest. Here, I have neither any personal gain nor any loss. This is the simply a humble advice. It depends on her whether she agrees to me or not. The 'Vedic Mantras' are restricted for women. That restriction is not applicable for the 'Purans, and the books of History. It has been stated so on the basis of versions of the renowned learned person, As regards the 'History-Puran' there the women's right is not limited only to listen, even to read them is the right for all.</p>
<p class="Text">Once, a number of saints had gathered here at Rishikesh. I am a very common man, Malaviyaji was of the opinion that the women can listen and read the Puranic literature. Karapatraji Maharaj said that they could only hear but not read—on enquiry with me I replied that 'Both the things are stated in the Shastras..'</p>
<p class="Text">Somewhere here and there it is also stated that it is only Dandi Swami entitled of the muttering of 'Omkara' (OM) 'Rama-Nama' is equally important as 'Omkara'. The door of deliverance is open for us, why should we resist on the muttering of 'Omkara'? I do say that as the Muslims calling loudly the name, 'Allah-Allah,' if they repeat being overwhelmed with love, they will also get the same fruit. </p>
<p class="Text">Tulasidasji was the devotee of 'Rama-Nama'. He said the glory of Ram's Name stands at the top. By writing '<span class="char-style-override-3">Shri Ramacharita Manasa</span>' he declared Rama's Name' as the boat to cross the ocean of the world. Suradasji said—'Krishna's Name is the Supreme. 'Dhruva' will say that <span class="char-style-override-3">'OM namo Bhagawate Vasudevaya'</span> is the supreme. The Muslims will say the 'Allah' is the supreme. As water can be called by the different names as ' Jala' 'Aap', 'Nira', Water or 'Pani' by different persons, whatever the name is given. But in reality it will be the water only all word have the meaning 'water'. Likewise the Supreme Lord' is called by different names but by whatever 'Name' one repeats, the deliverance can be achieved. </p>
<p class="Text">The child expresses the letters 'Bu', the mother understands it and makes him drink the milk. Similarly in the same way if we mutter the Name of Rama instead of not Pronouncing OM (Omkara), Why will we not be emancipated? We will get deliverance surely. </p>

<p class="Text">We should have faith in God. Then there is no force in the world that may harm you.</p>

<p class="Text">Even on the path the great soul treads he will move destroying the sins of all. We are purified only by the look of the great soul.</p>
<p class="Text">It should be apparently understood that you made anyone listen the Lord's Name going there and he died while hearing then his birth proved fruitful. </p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 28.12.1963, Govind Bhawan, Kolkata.</p>
<p class="Text">While in meditation no other thought except the contemplation of the Lord should assail our mind, make prayer to the Lord—'Lord! Why are you delaying in blessing me with your sight? You are the friend of meek and I am a meek, If you try to see my blemishes there is no stand for me anywhere.' Call the Lord with the pathetic emotion—O Lord! He, Hari! The Lord is specially attentive to hear our piteous call.  </p>
<p class="Text">Remain confident that the Lord reaches at once on our call if it is whole-heartedly. The Lord can bless with his sight only by his special grace. The Lord is verily graceful. Man is free in the meditation of the Lord.   </p>
<p class="Text">The whole atmosphere is purified by the virtue of Loud chanting of divine names and all the hurdles take flight from there. </p>
<p class="Text">The physical comforts and our attachment with the world is a great obstacle in the Lord's attainment. We should establish our love to the Lord, such a joy is possible nowhere. Our attachment to this world is fearful and leads to transmigration. Remove this infatuation of the world with discrimination and Satsanga. The worship of the Lord, meditation, the study of the holy books these are the most valuable spiritual practice.</p>
<p class="Text">The service of afflicted persons with unselfish motive, self-restraint and the renunciation from the world are very necessary in the practice of spiritual exercise by attaining the state of renunciation the position of self-restraint automatically becomes the part of our nature. </p>

<p class="Text">One story came to my mind just. A saint asked a Seth to make adoration of the Lord. The Seth gave the reply that he had no spare time. On the advice of the saint the Seth made the rule to remember the lord at time of his bathing. At the time of death he was bathed and the Lord's Name came to his memory and he got deliverance. So the Lord should be remembered every moment. There is neither labour nor any expenditure. That time of bath proved useful for him, nothing is more useful than the rememberance of the Lord'.</p>
<p class="Text">Here is the notable point that if the sound of any dog, crow or any animal or bird is being heard in the house at the time of death of someone they should be removed away from there. No worldly matter should be talked with the dying man. If his concentration of mind would be devoted to the Lord and we started talking about the worldly affairs his rebirth is more probable. The dying man should be made to remember the Lord and no talk relating to the worldly affairs should be made with him. </p>
<p class="Text">The dying man may be the sinner of any category but if he could be able to remember the Lord's Name at the time of his death, it is certain that he will attains his redemption, there is no doubt about it. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord can be attained at any moment of the twenty four hours. Five things are needed to be given up by him for this purpose—food, water, sleep, faeces and urine and two things are needed to be adopted the muttering of the Lord's Name and his meditation.</p>
<p class="Text">At the time of death if the mind is attracted towards the sound of the birds and animals the rebirth is a must, so, at the time of anyone's death the sound of any bird and animal should be restricted to be heard by the dying man.</p>
<p class="Text">If the barking of dog is heard by the dying man, he also takes the next birth in the class of birth of a dog, he may be the striver of the highest category, it does not matter. So, remain cautious and effort should be made that the man may have the memory of the Lord at the time of his death.</p>

<p class="Text">Principal incarnations are of Lord Shri Rama and Lord Shri Krishna Among all the incarnations of the God. The 'Asan' (seat) is required before the mediation. The Lord has said for the Asan (Seat)—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">शुचौ देशे प्रतिष्ठाप्य स्थिरमासनमात्मनः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नात्युच्छ्रितं नातिनीचं चैलाजिनकुशोत्तरम्॥</p>

<p class="Text">'Having firmly placed his seat in spot which is free from dirt and other impurities with the sacred Kush grass, a deerskin and a cloth spread thereon, one upon the other (Kush below, deerskin in the middle and the cloth uppermost) neither very high nor very low.'</p>
<p class="Text">What will be holier place than this? The solitary place and the sand of Gangaji is very pious. The seat should be prepared with Kush, deerskin and cloth, all these three together that even cannot be superior to the sand of Gangaji. Now, the question arises why did the Lord not suggest the seat of the only sand of Gangaji? The reality is that it is not easily accessible to all. This seat of sand is very pious, there is simplicity in it and the atoms here have power to make the mind concentrated in the meditation. Now, to sit down firmly—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘समं कायशिरोग्रीवं’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 6/13).' 'Holding the trunk, head and neck straight.

<p class="Text">Question—Whether the meditation of the Lord should be performed in the space or in the heart? </p>
<p class="Text">Answer—As it suits you.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—Whether the meditation should be practised of Sakar or Nirakar?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Meditate the 'Sakar' considering Him as all pervasive in attributeless form. As there is the moon of full lit-night in the Sky. Equally like the sky there is the formless existence of the Lord, and there is his attributed form also like moon. Whether you concentrate your mind in sky of the heart or in the space of Brahma. Sakar and Nirakar both are the same. They are not two separate entities. The single one has two forms. Now, concentrate your mind to such Supreme Lord. The lotus face of the Lord is compared to the moon.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—In the attributed form should we meditate on Vishnu or Rama?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—In whom your inclination is that is the best for you. Simile of Moon is verily there that is why Chandra word is affixed to Lord Rama and Lord Krishna that is why 'Das' word is not affixed as Krishnadas.</p>

<p class="Text">The striver, having firmly placed his seat in a spot which is sacred and secluded with the sacred Kush Grass should sit in any Posture 'Swastika', 'Siddha' or 'Padmasana' (lotus posture in Yoga with the right foot folded and placed on the left thigh and left foot folded to rest on the right thigh) straight comfortably and distracting his sense organs from the sensual objects having sacrificed all the worldly desires should be free from spurt. He should call his deity with the pious inner self combined with renunciation being free from laziness. When the Lord appears in the state of meditation the inner self is thrilled with joy, tranquility and illuminated with the light of knowledge and appears the great brilliance spread in the whole sphere of the globe apparently when the eyes are closed. Where there is peace there is no distraction and where there is the glow of knowledge the sleep and lethargy cannot reach there. We should have the firm conviction that the Lord appears on the Prayer and worship in the state of meditation. There is no problem also in the meditation of the attributed form of the deity. If you argue that to meditate the visible form is easy, how can the unseen object be meditated? Well! But on the basis of the words of the saints, sages and Shashtras and on the basis of the charming pictures of the deity also meditation can be practised. So, it is proper for striver to call his deity the Lord having closed his eyes and in case the Lord doesn't come on the common call, than, by chanting and praying the Lord's Name by hymning His attributes and by singing in His praises and by reciting the divine hymns and verses in His praise the Lord should be called again and again with love and devotion pathetic emotion and choking throat and having hope of His arrival and waiting for Him—this chaupai should be pronounced—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">एक बात मैं पूँछहु तोही। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कारन कवन बिसारेहु मोही॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Lord! I ask you only one thing as what was the cause that you forgot me?'</p>
<p class="Text">Then, there should be the belief in us that the Lord, our deity is standing apparently in front of us just at the distance of about two feet in the sky. There after viewing the sight of that divine image from his feet to head this chaupai should be read—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाथ सकल साधन मैं हीना। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कीन्हीं कृपा जानि जन दीना॥</p>
<p class="Text">'O Lord! I am bereft of all the means, you have graced me with your mercy considering me your humble servant, means I did not engage in any spiritual discipline that might prove to be support for me. To have your vision even in the meditation, but you have blessed me with Your sight in the meditation only to consider me a meek person. 'Thus' on the arrival of the Lord the striver starts his conversation; with the Lord in the state of meditation. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—'Lord' why do you take so much time in Your manifestation even in the state of my meditation? Why don't You appear just at my call? Why do You tantalize me so much?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—Your great interest lies in tantalizing you? </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—What is my interest in tantalization? I don't understand. I do think my interest is in only Your manifestation.</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—The delay in arrival is more beneficial. There is created impatience in separation, there is the keen desire, the arrival at that moment gives more joy. As there in excess of appetite the food taken at that moment gives the taste of nectar. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhaka—It is right, but the excess of delay may disappoint the Sadhaka and he may discontinue his meditation also. </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—If he is so faithless to Me and he may leave his meditation being fed up due to the delay in My arrival, then what is the use of blessing him with My sight?</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhaka—Well, but by Your appearance his interest in You will increase and his practice of spiritual exercise will wax also, so it is proper for You to appear at his single call.</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—It is proper what I think and I do only what is proper.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Lord! I should agree to the same what You speak, but this mind is very notorious; that does not allow to agree. What You say only that is right, but it seems pleasant to me that You should appear at once When I call you now, tell me what is that call that may move You to reach at a single call?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—When the Sadhak pines for Me only like the Gopis due to separation I may reach then and there or having love and faith in Me when being restless in eagerness like Draupadi and Gajendra (Elephant leader) and he calls Me, I may reach. Or I may come for him also who remembers Me like Prahlad without any selfish motive.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—What is this Your habit to reach after creating restlessness causing separation? Why do You torture by giving pangs of separation? </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—The restlessness created by separation is the state of the higher category. To pine for in separation increases the intensity of love and then at that time the devotee cannot bear the pain of the separation of even a single moment. He attains My state forever. After the first meeting he never abandons Me. As Bharat remained restless for fourteen years due to separation, then he never left My company.   </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—When You have any work before Yourself to get it done by someone, You often deputed only Lakshman and Shatrughna to get it done and not to Bharat; what is the secret behind it?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—Bharat could not tolerate the pangs of My separation due to the excess of deep love. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Then, how did he tolerate the separation of fourteen years?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—He had to suffer the sorrow of <span class="char-style-override-6">m</span>y separation to be bound by My command and that very separation deepened the love so much that he never separated from Me since then. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—What was the interest of Bharat in that separation that <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>ou thought in <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>our mind? </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—By the separation of fourteen years he came to realize and know the essence of meeting and separation. He began to feel the separation of a minute like the separation of an age. If it had not happened so how would he have been attracted towards Me so much?</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—The restlessness of separation can even cause disappointment also?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—I have already told you what is the need to bless such men with My sight?</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Then what should such men do for having <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>our vision?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—Whatsoever way may be he should develop love and devotion in Me, he should make such an effort.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Is <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>our sight not possible without love and devotion?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—Yes, it is not possible, this is the propriety. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhaka—Can <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>ou not relax this rule? </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—If this relaxation is endowed with one and not to other, it is embued with inequity, All cannot be relaxed. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Is such a relaxation in <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>our rule ever possible?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—Yes, such a relaxation in My rule is reserved for the last time at the time of death. At that time while dying without love and devotion even he can attain Me only to remember Me. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Then, why is this special relaxation even for him also?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—His life span is going to end. He is departing having abandoned this body forever. So, Under the special consideration he has been exempted specially from this rule. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—No doubt, it is proper that he has been given the special opportunity of this relaxation for the last moment of life. But in the last time while dying our mind, reason, and sense organs don't remain under self-control; so  is not under self-capacity to remember <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>ou at that time of death.  </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—For this purpose the practice should be made to think of Me constantly always. He who makes such practice is sure to think of Me at the time of death also.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—I have longing that I should always remain remembering <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>ou every moment and I make effort also but the flickering and insolent mind makes me helpless and my all efforts fail before it, what is the way to adopt for this purpose?</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—Wherever your mind goes, it should be diverted from there to Me by coaxing with love again and again or thinking of Me Omnipresent. I should be contemplated there wherever the mind goes.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—I have heard this, read it and I understand it also; but at that time this device goes beyond my mind, so I cannot remember <span class="char-style-override-6">y</span>ou.</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—You have formed this bad habit due to your attachment and for the annihilation of attachment and to improve your habit you should have communion with great souls and the practice of repeating of 'Name' should be done.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—This can be done to some extent and it is also beneficial; but unfortunately it is also not done by me always this is my ill luck.</p>
<p class="Text">Lord—There is no question of ill luck in this matter, it is you who lack in practice.</p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Lord! Are the adoration and company of the saintly men possible by the efforts? I have heard that the company of the pious men is got as the result of our stored auspicious deeds in the past only. </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—By Seeking <span class="char-style-override-6">m</span>y shelter as well as the shelter of the saints whatever the effort is made for the practice of <span class="char-style-override-6">m</span>y worship becomes successful, it is dead sure. Undoubtedly, the bad company and the worldly attachments and accumulated impressions create hindrance; but by the hard practice the obstacles are removed and by the gradual progress in the spiritual practice there is the enhancement of love and devotion and then the obstacles and hurdles cannot even reach near. Destiny only causes us enjoy the fruits of the actions done by us in the previous births that cannot create any disturbance in performance of new auspicious deeds. Whatever the hindrance is created that is the weakness of the striver. Without the stored auspicious deeds even by the effort with love and devotion by the help of the Lord's grace the company of pious saints can be got. </p>
<p class="Text">Sadhak—Lord! Several persons try to commune with great souls but when it is not obstained they blame their fate. Is it right? </p>
<p class="Text">Lord—It is right, but there can be misconception also in this case. There comes slackness in the spiritual practice. Even after best efforts as required if the religious congregation does not become possible it can be admitted so, but in this case instead of blaming the fate. We should condemn the lack of love and devotion what is there in us; by love and devotion of new destiny is marked and association with saintly persons can be available.  </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-29">The Importance of the Lord's Remembrance at the last moment of death*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 1.6.1941, Morning, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">This land of ours is very pious. Even within the range of hundreds of miles such a pious land will not be available, even reaching home if you may think of this land you may develop renunciation. This is Mayapuri. By abandoning the body here. We become free from rebirth in this world. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/5)</p>
<p class="Text">'He who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state; there is no doubt about it.'</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states that if anyone could not get liberation even after attaining this human body, there must be salvation of this man at least at the time of death anyhow. So the Lord has made this rule that if one could think of Me (the Lord) alone at the time of death by any way, he will attain Me (the Lord).</p>
<p class="Text">The criminal who is sentenced to death by the government, the government also fulfils his last desire at the time when he is hanged to death. So, the Lord also made the special rule for the dying man that he attains 'Me' if he thinks of Me alone at the time of death, there is no doubt about it. The Lord has not made this rule only to attain 'Him' but this rule is applicable to all.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/6) </p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, thinking of whatever entity one leaves the body at the time of death, that and that alone one attains, being ever absorbed in its thought.'</p>
<p class="Text">At the time of death whatever entity of living being one thinks of at the time of death, he will attain the entity of that conscious being, but if the entity of inanimate object came to his thought, he attains the life of ant-mouse etc., living in the house, but if he thinks of the Lord he attains the Lord. That is why the lord states</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/7)</p>
<p class="Text">'Therefore, Arjun, think of me at all times and fight. With mind and reason thus set on Me, you will doubtless come to Me.</p>
<p class="Text">Set mind and reason on Me, What is the meaning of to setting on mind?—Always to think of the Lord. What is to set on with reason—be firm of the Lord's existence with the reason. By such practice it is certain to think of the Lord at the time death.</p>
<p class="Text">Now <span class="char-style-override-4">िनयतात्मभि:</span> (<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/2) by those of steadfast mind' comes in discourse. With all attributes manifested form, formless without attributes, with attributes formless all these three are the Lord Shri Krishna. Here discussion is of the meditation of Lord Shri Krishna with attributes and form integrated with formless, because by the 'Mama' word here means the description of the entire integral form. The Lord states it is I the 'Adhiyagya' Set on Me with Mind and reason.</p>
<p class="Text">How I am known by the men of steadfast mind this is told below—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अभ्यासयोगयुक्तेन चेतसा नान्यगामिना। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">परमं पुरुषं दिव्यं याति पार्थानुचिन्तयन्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/8) </p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, he who with his mind disciplined through Yoga in the form of practice of meditation and thinking of nothing else, is constantly engaged in contemplation of God, attains the supremely effulgent divine Purush (God).'</p>
<p class="SHLOK">ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/13) </p>
<p class="Text">"He who leaves the body and departs uttering the one indestructible Brahma, OM, and dwelling on Me in My absolute aspect, reaches the Supreme goal."</p>
<p class="Text">Now the question arises that it is very difficult to do so at the time of death, this can also be done only by the men of steadfast mind. The Lord here states the way for the practice as uttered in the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> chapter 8, verses 14—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, whosoever always and constantly thinks of Me with undivided mind, to that Yogi ever absorbed in Me I am easily attainable.' </p>
<p class="Text">The spiritual practice of the formless with attributes and the formless without attributes both are difficult but the discipline for the manifested form with attributes is easy. </p>
<p class="Text">Like Arjun if we sleep we should sleep with the Lord in the mind, while eating we should have the Lord with us, As the mind flies away somewhere else and we continue eating, let not the mind go anywhere else and let us always think of the God. The destiny will continue pulling on our body but the mind should be concentrated to the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Not to tell the formless Brahma without attribute and with attribute these two are difficult to be obtained by the practice of spiritual exercise I told you the easy way of the spiritual exercise, the mind of everyone is attracted towards the easy one.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is beyond time and the worlds of Brahma etc., are conditional by time so they are transient.</p>
<p class="Text">To attain the Lord is the perfect accomplishment, the highest goal. Now the Lord states the speciality of his attainment—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोकाः पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/16)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, all the worlds from Brahmaloka (the heavenly realm of the creator, Brahma) downwards are liable to birth and rebirth. But O son of Kunti, on attaining Me there is no rebirth. (for, while I am beyond Time, regions like Brahmloka, being conditioned by time, are transitory)</p>
<p class="Text">It is insignificant to talk of others, even those who have already reached the region of Brahma take rebirth and come back to this world. But those who have attained the Supreme Lord don't take rebirth.</p>
<p class="Text">Now, the Lord states that why do they come back again from the region of Brahma, because all the world from Brahmloka downward are conditioned by time and thus transitory—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सहस्त्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद् ब्रह्मणो विदु:।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">रात्रिं युगसहस्त्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/17)</p>
<p class="Text">'Those Yogis who know from realization Brahma's day as covering a thousand Mahayagas, and so his night as extending to another thousand Mahayagas, know the reality about Time.'</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अव्यक्ताद‍्व्यक्तयः सर्वाः प्रभवन्त्यहरागमे। </p>

<p class="Text">'All embodied beings emanate from the Unmanifest (i.e., Brahma's subtle body) at the coming of the Comic day; at cosmic nightfall they merge into the same subtle body of Brahma, known as the unmanifest.'</p>
<p class="Text">According to the measurement 'Kaliyuga' is the period of 4,32,000 years. The double of 'Kali age is 'Dwapar' and the triple and four times of the 'Kaliyug' more are the 'Treta' and 'Satyayug'. On the completion of these four Yugas one thousand times is equal to one day of Brahma and the night also covers the same period of time. </p>
<p class="Text">The beginning of the Brahma's one day is the cosmic day. The end of the Brahmas one day is the cosmic night. From the unmanifest body of Brahma, in the beginning of his day it is the Brahma who creates all beings. As the potter makes the earthen pots. The efficient and the material both causes is Brahma. The cause of Brahma also is the Supreme Being. When the night of Brahma (Cosmic night come) falls all the beings are merged into Brahma. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भूतग्रामः स एवायं भूत्वा भूत्वा प्रलीयते। </p>

<p class="Text">'Arjun, This multitude of beings, being born again and again, is dissolved under compulsion of its nature at the coming of the cosmic night, and rises again the commencement of the Cosmic day.'</p>
<p class="Text">This multitude of beings born again and merged, born  again and merged, so the word 'Bhutwa' has been used twice. It continues again and again, he who fails to attain Me remains revolving in this cycle. It is implicit to make effort to attain the Lord. </p>

<p class="Text">There was a very rich seth (Merchant) in Bengal. A milk maid came to him. The sun was just about to set. She said—“Give me paise.” His accountant asked her to wait for a while. The milkmaid said—I have no time to wait. 'The accountant said—'Wait a little.' She again said—'The sun is going to set there is no more time. I have no time. That milkmaid said thrice. 'The Seth got her paid the money and at the same moment having cleared her account he started to go away and said—'There is no time. Our sun is going to set'. The Seth was impressed by this simple sermon of the milkmaid and by taking refuge in God became the great devotee of the Lord. The same is our condition also, where is the time? The Lord states—</p>

<p class="Text">'Therefore having obtained this joyless and transient human life, constantly worship me.' </p>
<p class="Text">The human body is very rare; but evidently it is perishable and joyless, not depending on time and not indulging in worldly enjoyments which appear to be joyful due to our ignorance, adore Me constantly. How the worship is to be done it is stated—</p>

<p class="Text">Concentrate your all the sense organs to the Lord. Dedicate yourself entirely to the Lord. The Lord states—'You shall come to Me certainly'. If anyone complains where is the time? Whatever the time is remaining that should be dedicated to the Lord. Past time wasted in worldly pleasures whatever is left now should be invested in divine worship. That man is the blessed one who offers his whole remaining time to the Lord, means he should pass his time in the adoration and meditation of the Lord, it is he only who knows the value of time. Any saint has stated—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">आये थे कछु लाभ को खोय चले सब मूल। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">फिर जाओगे सेठ पास पले पड़ेगी धूल॥</p>
<p class="Text">'We are born in this world in the human body to achieve some profit but at the time of departure from here We come to know that we have lost even the capital. When you reach the Seth (Lord) to seek something you will get dust.'</p>
<p class="Text">Will we again be able to obtain this human body? If you don't spend your time in the right way what will you answer to the Lord later on after death? So, dedicate your remaining time to the Lord, pass your time in the worship and contemplation of the Lord.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">पाया परम पद हाथ से जात </p>

<p class="Text">'The span of life what we had obtained from the Lord to attain the supreme abode, we have lost most of the time. Now, we should handover at last the remaining time to the hands of the Lord.'</p>
<p class="Text">There was a rich man. He lent one hundred rupees to someone for the purpose of his business and instructed him not to spend from the capital. He spent seventyfive rupees out of the one hundred rupees which was the capital, now, only twenty five rupees were remaining with him. Then, his mates said—'The lord is very kind. Go before him with whatever is remaining with you. He said—'I have no courage to face, Sethji, please, you also accompany me.' They were kind- hearted they accompanied him. He narrated the true situation before Sethji, he expressed his regret and hesitation. Then, Sethji forgave him. Exactly in the same way, the span of life what we have obtained from the Lord we have lost most of the time. Even now we should handover the remaining age of our life to the hands of the Lord, means if we pass the remaining age of our life in the worship and meditation of the Lord, our purpose will be served. The saints also give their recommendation to the Lord in favour of the true man; but those who still hide the fact, try to deceive, who say only fifteen is balance though twenty five are remaining they are not heard. If ninety nine rupees were spent and even a single rupee is remaining, hand over the same one rupee honestly. If you commit theft even there, your purpose can never be served. The human life is invaluable. This is the version of any devotee—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">हाथ उठाके कहत हूँ कहौं बजाऊँ ढोल। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">श्वासा खाली जात है तीन लोक का मोल॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Raising my hands with the beat of drum I am telling. The breath which is equal to the value of the empire of three worlds is going waste.'</p>
<p class="Text">'Each and every breath has the value of the empires of the three worlds in the universe. If in the last breath even one could remember the Lord, he will attain Him.'</p>

<p class="Text">'He who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death attains my state; there is no doubt about it.'</p>
<p class="Text">The value of all the three worlds has no meaning before that single moment which is more valuable than this also. It does not require a year, a month, a day, an hour even only in a moment the Lord can be attained. After seeking-shelter to the Lord exclusively don't think of your least right on anyone. Forgetting your own self for ever seek shelter to the Lord, it means be established in the Lord so that the mind may not peep anywhere else, only the memory of the Lord may become the base of your life, the very moment the Lord may be attained.</p>
<p class="Text">Such is the rule of the Lord that even if a single second is remaining with you at the time of death, the life is about to depart from the body, enough! You can get the deliverance at the very second. How? By the remembrance of the Lord or by muttering His Name. The Lord is extremely kind-hearted there is a great relaxation at the door of the Lord, Even the kings gives some concession to the culprit who is to be hanged; he will be hanged, it is a must undoubtedly, he will be hanged, but his desire will be fulfilled if it is worth fulfilling. But the Lord states that the last desire must be fulfilled at any cost.</p>
<p class="Text">One is the vilest sinner, at the last time whatever and whosoever may be, he gets deliverance just the moment he remembers the Lord, It is such a big concession. This is only for the sinners, what is the need for a righteous person? The Lord thinks that he will die now it is not known after how many lakhs and crores of births he will again get the human body. The Lord is very kind-hearted; He provides chance at the last time. At that time all the crimes are pardonable; you will attain the Supreme goal if you depart from this body thinking of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">What importance have you given to the time? If you waste your time in earning money it means you are in delusion. Even if you pass your time in maintaining your body, sustaining your family, it is also foolishness. Just think on one side there is money and on the next side the Lord. What you got in maintaining the body, you just increased two kg. of earth only. The sustenance of the wife and son—O the idiot! The whole world is your own family, this is your great foolishness at all. Where the material progress and where there is the Lord in comparison. Having lost the Lord he who spends his time in such a way, Tulasidasji states for him—</p>

<p class="Text">'None will ever speak well of him who picks up a peppercorn throwing away the philosopher's stone.'</p>
<p class="Text">The peppercorn does not cost even single paisa. At the cost of the Lord you invest your time in the sense pleasure. Fool! The peppercorn looks only charming but its price in nothing not even a penny. The philosophers' stone is stone in look but its price can purchase the whole world. The peppercorn glitters red, but its mouth is black. The sense pleasures appear charming and pleasant. On the enjoyment of the worldly sensual objects, the face is darkened in the last. If you don't remember and chant the Lord's Name you will fall down into the pit of hell after death. The Lord is nectar apparently, Be immortal by attaining the Lord. Then again you will not take birth and face death. If ignoring such a Lord you take the poison of worldly enjoyments you will remain revolving in the cycle of birth and death forever.</p>

<p class="Text">'The fools who devote their mind to the pleasures of sense even after attaining human birth take poison in exchange for nectar.'</p>
<p class="Text">Such as man is a fool. It is obvious, To remain thinking of the worldly enjoyments is to take poison. The contemplation and the viewing of the Lord is nectar. The joy what is there in the contemplation of the Lord, is not available even in the empire of all the three worlds.</p>
<p class="Text">The poison of the sense objects is like the poison mixed with jaggery or hidden in the sweet meat ball. Duryodhan had given the ball like sweet meat mixed with poison to Bhima, He ate it gladly, when he fainted, Duryodhan having wrapped him in the creepers and leaves threw away into the sea. Floating away in the sea he happened to reach the world of serpents, there by snakes' bite the poison of his body became ineffective. Being in senses, he came back home. Bhima got such a chance then he was saved otherwise he would have died. He ate the ball of sweet meat in deception but we are eating by open challenge. The Shastras and saints are clearly stating, they are declaring it openly that that this is the poison. If Bhima had been informed would he have taken the sweetmeat? So, we should pass our time in the adoration and mediation of the Lord. The joy of adoration and meditation is apparent; it is not so as the fruit of the offering of the oblation to the ancestors or charity donation which is got in the next world. Bhartrihari has stated—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अजानन् दाहार्तिं पतति शलभः तीव्रदहने </p>

<p class="Text">The Brahman asked—Deva! You described about the 'Mahayagya' the offering in the name of the deceased father. Now explain to me what should be done by the son when his father is yet alive, What is that duty by performing which a wise son can attain the highest good in the birth after births? Please, explain all about it in detail diligently. </p>
<p class="Text">Shri Bhagawan said—O the foremost Brahman! The father should be worshipped considering him like god and maintain affection to him like a son. His command should never be violated even in the mind. The son who treats very well to his diseased father and serves him, becomes worthy of everlasting heavenly life and he is always worshipped by the gods. Even when the father is at the edge of death and the symptoms of death are visible in him even then by worshipping him the son become like the gods. For the deliverance of the father by keeping fast according to the rules of the religious treaties with the particular motive of his highest good what are the gains that I describe now. Listen! The fruit of noble deeds what is got after the performance of one thousand 'Ashwamedha Yagya' and one hundred 'Rajsuya Yagya' the same fruit is got by keeping fast for the sake of the father. If the same fast is kept at any holy place of the pilgrimage the fruit what is got, is crores of times more than the fruits of the both 'Yogyas'. That noble person who dies in the water of Gangaji, never again drinks the milk of his mother but he becomes free from the birth and death. He who dies willingly living in Kashi merges in Me after enjoying the fruit of his desires. </p>

<p class="Text">'The Supreme goal of life what a sage who faithfully observed celibacy from the sacred thread ceremony till death attains, the same Supreme position which is attained by him who abandons his body in the seven currents of the river Brahmaputra.' Particularly, he who abandons his body in the last days of his life taking shelter of the north bank of 'Sone' river according to the divine rules, attains My state. The man who dies inside a house his body is tied with the number of bonds as are there the knots in the thatches of the house. He becomes free from one knot after one year and accordingly one by one he becomes free from all the bonds year after year. The son and the relatives remain looking at helplessly, nobody proves helpful to him to get him rid of the bonds. The man who dies on the mountain, in the forest, at inaccessible place or deserted place meets the evil destiny. He has to take his rebirth in the class of birth of the insects and worms etc. The dead man whose funeral ceremony is performed on the second day of his death, remains lying in the 'Kumbhipak-hell' for sixty thousand years. The man who leaves his body in the down fallen condition after touching the untouchable passes his long existence in the hell and than he is born in the lowest class of birth. By the fruits of noble deeds or by performing the auspicious deeds all the men of this mortal world attain the entity that and that alone whatever the entity they think of at the time of death.</p>
<p class="Text">After the death of the father the vigorous son who carries his body on his shoulder, gets the fruit of <span class="char-style-override-3">'Ashwamedha Yagya'</span> at every step. It is the duty of a son that having placed the dead body on the Pyre Chanting the 'Mantras' (Spells) according to the ordains of the Shastras he should first set fire into his mouth, and there after he should burn his whole body. At that time he should utter thus—“I burn the body-organs and this corpse of my that father who was combined with greed and attachment and overwhelmed with sin and virtues; may the divine world be attained to him' thus having burnt the body, the son should pass some days in the wait for the accumulation of his bones and then at the due time having collected the bones, on the tenth day after taking bath. he should give up the wet clothes, and then, on the eleventh day the learned person should perform the ceremony of 'Ekadashah' offering and for the nourishment of the body of the dead, he should feed one Brahman and donate the clothes, wooden seat and wooden sandals etc., according to the rules of the Shastras. There are all sixteen offerings to the deceased that have been recognized on the fourth day of the 'Dashah' (tenth day after the death) to be performed (Chaturthah; to be performed) after the three fortnights, Traipakshik or 'Shardhamasik' to be performed within six months (Unkshan masik) and to be performed within a year (Unabdik) offering and in addition to it twelve more offerings are there of every month to be performed for the deceased. There are all sixteen offerings to the deceased that have been recognized—If these sixteen offering are not perfomed for the dead person to the best of his capacity with love, devotion, he gets established as an evil spirit, He does not get released from the species of this evil spirit even hundreds of 'Shraddha' are performed for him. After one year the learned person should perform the offering to the deceased named, 'Sapindikarana' with 'Parvana' method.</p>

<p class="Text">'Even only one time the congregational singing of the Lord Krishna's Name if performed whether it has been done with devotion and love or unwillingly, liberates the human being whoever be may be.'</p>
<p class="Text">Question—I have been making efforts for a number of years, visited a number of saints, toured about at the holy places of pilgrimages, practised the rituals and practised different kinds of austereties, but my wicked mind does not come under control by any means. The statement of the saints and Shastras is that without the restrained mind the Lord cannot be attained. It is without any dispute that without the attainment of the Lord this life is worthless. I have lost my courage, I will be unable to attain the Lord despite my intense desire, is there any solution of my problem? Will the Lord accept me—a man of unstable mind showering his grace upon me?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—If there is sincere eagerness and efforts are made with tenacity it is not impossible to control the mind. There are so many ways to restrain the mind, by adopting which the mind can be controlled certainly, but in this life of Kaliyuga there is nowhere peace in the mind. The human mind remains surrounded with different kinds of mental and physical ailments, so it is very difficult to absorb the mind in the practice of spiritual exercises that control the mind. It is also difficult to develop the firm faith and true devotion due to different kinds of obstacles in spite of whole hearted effort to absorb oneself in the spiritual exercise. </p>
<p class="Text">Question—Is there any way possible to make the human life fruitful?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Yes, why not? There is such a good way which can be easily practised and adopted by all and Sundry even from a Brahman to a low caste person from highly learned to stark-fool, men and women both, anyone of moral conduct or immoral person. This is the way to repeat the Lord's Name by speech constantly. One may be in any situation or condition by muttering of the Lord's Name with its natural merits can fulfill his ambition and it causes him to attain the Lord at last. In the other practices there is need of the self control and purity. The practice gives the fruit according the feeling and attitude, but it is not so in the muttering of the Lord's Name, if His Name is remembered with any intention that leads to the highest good only. </p>

<p class="Text">'No more effort is needed in repeating the Lord's Name, it is only to move the tongue. The Vedas and Purans have been stating the gain of repeating the Lord's Name is indescribable in words because it is beyond limit and unique. The repeating of the Lord's Name cannot be compared with any religion, austerity, accomplishment and knowledge, discipline, meditation. 'Premlata' says that those are blessed ones who believe that name is all and all and it is the Supreme.  Even the fate line of the wicked deeds is removed away by repeating the Lord's Name impossible becomes possible. The Name repeated with any intention bestows blessedness in all the ten directions. The bad is turned to good by repeating the Name. The death that devours everyone in the world becomes like sustaining mother by the influence of the Name. 'Premalata' says that those saints are blessed ones who love to repeat the Name. Crores of hurdles run away to hear the sound of the Lord's Name. The fire becomes cool, the poison becomes health giving by the influence of the Lord's Name. The enemies become friend and the lion, boar and scorpions get afraid of him who always remains counting on the beads of rosary the Lord's Name. The Lord Ram always remains in protection with his bow and arrow, Lord Shiv with trident, Brahma with his staff, Vishnu with discus and Narayan with his mace remain always ready to protect from the enemies of the devotee who mutters the Lord's Name. 'Premalata' says that Hanumanji fulfils all the desires whatever he wants. Sitaji blesses him with meal and Goddess Durga gives him her shelter. The glory of the 'Name' is so influential that the demons-gods, ghosts-demigods, animals-birds all the beings of the world forget their discrimination and get overwhelmed by compassion and mercy. 'Pramalata' says that they are the fools who even though getting this unobtainable human body fail to repeat the Lord's Name. The Lord's illusory potency consisting of three modes of nature is making  the whole world dancing to its tune. He is the creator and the destroyer both this is the Lords's Maya that creates this world sustains and then annihilates it. That very Maya vanishes by the repetition of names. Even minds of the savants and saints are deviated in a moment by her. This Maya fondles as children, sages, saints, enlightened ones who repeat divine names. Even the Lord Rama hesitates to and feels unable to describe the efficacy of Name's glory. By repeating the 'Name' the downtrodden are purified and attains the divinity without making any effort. Yavana attained supreme abode. Even the hunter attained the Supreme Divine state—They are the blessed in this world who sing the Name and praise the attributes of 'Siyarama'. The more you repeat the Lord's Name the More joy you will experience in the last. He who does not follow this advice due to his worldly attachment will repent later on. If you don't' repeat the name of 'Sita and Rama' you would be kicked and knocked only and in the end getting tied by the messengers of Lord Yama you will be dragged away there. So, now don't delay and start repeating the name of 'Siyaram'. Don't care for the slander of the world and dignity of the family and the relations with the relatives. Develop your love in the Lord leaving the cowardice and guilt, don't waste this valuable human body worthlessly. You daily read and hear about the glory of the Name of 'Sita-Rama' by so many means, then, why don't' you repeat their 'Names' constantly much more instead of making excuses? Why do you deviate from the path of worship and why don't you proceed onward on the path of adoration? 'Premalata' advises us to run fast on the path of adoring Siya and Rama?</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-33">Do that what pleases the Lord*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 2.8.1959, Govind Bhawan, Kolkata.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—What is the primary remedy of the disease of birth and death?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—To repeat the Lord's Name selflessly and his contemplation. Whatsoever may happen but there should be no worry or botheration in the mind. We should ever remain cheerful taking every dispensation of God as benedictory. We should pray to the God with pathetic tearful eyes. If tears do not flow we should pray piteously. No nervousness can be created in the mind if we depend on the support of the Lord's mercy. You should adopt whatever you read in your life firmly on the support of the Lord's grace and with the self-will power you posses. To bring yourself in such a condition you should invest your full strength obstinately. Your all the efforts should be made for the love of the Lord and to attain Him. In our disease we should recognise God's mercy. Disease is serious and you feel excess of pain it should be considered that the Lord wants to purify you very soon. Effort should be made to remember the Lord every moment when you feel the intense Pain. Make prayer to the Lord that your love to the Lord may continue even if there is the intensity of pain in my body.</p>
<p class="Text">It takes not so much time for the purity of inner self by repeating the Lord's Name, by performing the action with unselfish motive and doing the selfless service. If the unselfish motive is added to the journey of the holy places of pilgrimages, keeping Vow, communion with saints, 'Yagya' charity donation, service etc. Its capability is multiplied. A Little practice of unselfishness bestows us deliverance from the world. Unselfish motive has a heavy weight. If there is the feeling of selfishness in your inner self that is a stigma. </p>
<p class="Text">If any destitute and helpless lying on the road is got admitted in a hospital it is a work of God. Even the insignificant work becomes very meritorious if there is the higher motive.   </p>
<p class="Text">To make the dying man listen the Lord's Name, the turn is fixed among the persons, he is more gainer specially in whose turn, the dying man passed away, and the others, too, are also gainer. The Lord has given exemption of one minute for the death. Even the vilest sinner attains the Supreme goal if he remembers the 'Lord's Name at the time of death.</p>
<p class="Text">The work of Gita press is not unremunerative work, but this is the practice of Spiritual exercise. Consider all the works of Gita Press as the ladder of spirituality.</p>
<p class="Text">The Publicity of the books of Gita Press is also the supreme service. All the works are service but if it is done with the selfless motive this is the supreme service. The publicity of Gitaji, the publicity of the books, to make the dying man listen the Divine Name, to deliver discourse—all these are the works of the highest service.</p>
<p class="Text">Here, according to your views there is the difference between the service and the highest service but for me all the woks of service are the highest service.</p>
<p class="Text">All the works what we do that is for the sake of Lord. So, the works that don't please the Lord, means the evil deeds should not be done by us. The work which pleases the Lord is the work to be done for the sake of the Lord. Work for which there is the command of God, it is God's work. The work which is not Lord's command is not at all the work of God, that should not be done. For example—Wenching, anger, greed etc. To follow the rules made by the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> committee is also the Lord's work. Being free from attachment and aversion man can attain his supreme goal, so long as there is our attachment and aversion, our redemption is not possible .</p>
<p class="Text">We should nurse a desire for God only and should not have our own desire at all. Not to have any desire is the unselfish motive. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is not appearing, because we have desire for the worldly objects in our mind, so it is getting late in the Lord's arrival.  </p>
<p class="Text">Our sense of mineness should remain confined only for the Lord, to extend our attachment to others is blemish, We should serve others because for this there is the Lord's command. </p>
<p class="Text">We should shape ourselves according to the dictation given in the verses from thirteen to nineteen in the chapter twelve of the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>. Because the Lord states—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय:।’ </span>'He who is My devotee is dear to Me.'</p>
<p class="Text">By the selfless action, the muttering of Lord's Name and by the contemplation of the Lord our sins are wiped away. By repeating the Lord's Name We get rid of the sins and by meditation our distraction is Vanished and by the Lord's grace the Veil is removed away. </p>
<p class="Text">In the path of devotion more emphasis has been given on the Lord's remembrance. The Lord states that—'He who thinks of Me constantly I am easily attainable to him.'</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/14)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, whosoever always and constantly thinks of Me with undivided mind, to that Yogi ever absorbed in Me I am easily attainable.'</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states this practice easy and it is easy apparently also. When the Lord comes to our memory at that time also we feel cheerful. In its reward also we are happy. To remember the Lord's Name with any intention is good but if we remember with love and devotion that is much more valuable. Tulasidas has given as much emphasis on repeating the 'Name' so much emphasis he has not given on remembrance. In <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>, the Lord has stated that the muttering of name is his own form and said—'Among the 'Yagyas' I am the 'Japa Yagya.' To remember the Lord's Name and His form has been given more importance in the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> and <span class="char-style-override-3">Ramayana</span>.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—What name should be repeated?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—The striver should repeat the same 'name' to which he has devotion. There are several names of the Lord. In the 'Kaliyuga', this spell consisting sixteen letters is more special—</p>
<p class="Text">'Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram Hare Hare Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare.'</p>
<p class="Text">The muttering of this spell can be performed at any time whether in the pure or impure condition both. If this spell is muttered three and half crores of times with selfless motive it is especially more beneficent. Selflessness is sentiment and repeating name is action, if the selfless motive is included with muttering, the muttering becomes much superior and special. It is what I say that the God is attained by the muttering only. In the spell of sixteen letters Rama Krishna and Hari all the three names of God are included. </p>
<p class="Text">Since the Lord is the destroyer of the sins so His Name is 'Hari'. The word 'Krishna' means—the real bliss. What the meaning is derived from the root of the word that indicates formless God. Rama means—that enshrines everyone is 'Rama' or in whom the Yogis take delight in embodiment of existence, consciousness and bliss is 'Rama'.</p>
<p class="Text">Hari, Rama, Krishna—these three were born in all the three ages, They were only 'Sachchidanandaghana' embodiment of existence consciousness and Bliss. The memory of the form of the Lord's Name is very Important. Renunciation is supporter in this. The path of selfless action, the path of meditation etc., are the independent spiritual disciplines. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states—'He who thinks of Me always and constantly with undivided mind ever absorbed in Me, I am easily attainable to him.'</p>

<p class="SHLOK">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते। </p>

<p class="Text">As a collie bears the burden of the load likewise I bear his burden. I protect the seeker to the extent he has reached and what is yet not attained to him I get him attained, The Lord states—</p>

<p class="Text">'In order to shower My grace on them, I. dwelling in their heart, dispel their darkness born of ignorance by the shining lamp of wisdom.'</p>
<p class="Text">I impart knowledge to them who constantly and always think of Me and repeat My Name Means I emancipate them. The Lord should always and constantly be remembered at every time. When going to bed in the night we should sleep thinking Him. By doing so the night time becomes the spiritual practice. While sleeping awakened, sitting-standing every moment if we think of the God, our salvation is certain. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states in the 'Gitaji—'Thinking of whatever the entity one leaves the body at the time of death, that and that alone. One attains, being ever absorbed in its thought, As when he leaves the body at the time of death if he is absorbed in thought of a dog, cat etc. He will attain that and that only. He who thinks of Me only being ever absorbed in My thought at the time of death and abandons his body will attain Me only. Death is certain when it will visit it is not known, so the Lord should always remain in your memory.  </p>

<p class="Text">'Therefore, Arjun, thinks of Me at all times and fight with mind and reason thus set on Me, you will doubtless come to me.'</p>
<p class="Text">One should mutter and remember only the Name of his deity whom he worships with love and devotion because all are the Names and forms of the same Lord, that very should be considered the Supreme—</p>
<p class="Text">At the present time the religious books are available at such a cheap price and the religious congregation is also easily available, so the advantage should be taken now. Such a situation cannot continue for a long time. </p>
<p class="Text">Four hundred years back when Tulasidasji, Kabirdasji, Mirabai etc., were born, at that time a number of persons had been redeemed by them. Such a time has again come. Its advantage should be taken, otherwise you will have to repent more and more. Keeping this view in your mind serve your purpose as soon as possible. At such a time you are fortunate to get the human body. </p>
<p class="Text">To blame others for the self fault is a sin other's errors should neither be heard, nor noticed and nor propagated. The sense organ which you use in finding fault at others or to see and hear the others fault will itself become faulty. Those who discuss the sins of others, share their vices. One's own faults and others merits should be viewed.</p>
<p class="Text">In whose company we develop the divine property, and anchor our mind in God. That man should be considered that he is the man of divine property. If the characteristics of demoniac property assail us, he should be given up considering him like poison. There is one among lakhs such a person who has been able to attain his Supreme goal. Such one is not found even in thousands.</p>
<p class="Text">They whose company may cultivate noble feelings are the noble persons. It he is the devotee of the Lord, his sight will remind us of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">The orator should be such one who himself acts upon his version and then he asks others to do so, such one leaves his impact on others, He who preaches sermons for others but does not live them in his own practical life has no impact on others. </p>
<p class="Text">Where there is selfishness no merit is there at all. After the approach of selfishness merits run away, it means he is not a great soul. Where there is sensuousness and enjoyments there too, the great soul is not available. The men of noble merits remains intoxicated with knowledge, devotion and renunciation. The men of higher category never boast of their superiorly, they feel shame if others appreciate them as great men.  </p>
<p class="Text">To concentrate mind the divine worship should be done. By the experience of which adoration Prahlad says—'Father, see this fire has gone cool.' </p>
<p class="Text">What is the remedy? Repeating the Rama's Name is the remedy. A striver must pay his attention to the three points. He who is not ready to sacrifice his entire for the Lord and His love and who has no burning craving in his heart for the Lord, how is he a devotee? If a single member of the family forms the bad habits the entire family is defamed. If a single man of the society is deformed the whole society is defamed. If the devotee develops bad habits then he defames God. God does not keep any relation with him.</p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 1.5.1941, Samvat 1998, Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">To clean the faeces and urine of the man on death bed is a higher service. But this is a far fetched affair, even to make a dying man listen the Lord's Name is getting difficult. The Lord has stated—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 8/5)</p>
<p class="Text">'He who departs from the body thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state; there is no doubt about it.'</p>
<p class="Text">In this verse the Lord has made it clear that 'He who abandons this body thinking of Me alone, attains My state, there is no doubt about it' What are the words for a man who has even doubt here also?</p>
<p class="Text">To relate and make the dying man hear the Lord's Name and his attributes is much better than to give the spiritual sermons to four hundred men; Because even if a single man could attain his supreme goal by listening to the Lord's Name then my purpose was served. From the angle of knowledge all are the same soul, if the soul of anybody could get deliverance, it was the deliverance-of one's own; because that is also our own soul.</p>
<p class="Text">Any man alone cannot make the dying man listen the Lord's name day and night it is not known whose turn may prove such worthful. By chanting the Lord's Name for the other one's own adoration of God occurs and the other also gets the opportunity of listening to it. Someone is ill, someone is dying, to serve him is very excellent. It is the most benedictory deed to make him hear the Lord's Name and Gitaji.</p>
<p class="Text">You are reciting the verses of the Gitaji, chanting Rama's Name, Narayana's Name before the dying man to make him listen, in the meantime while listening he died, he attained the Lord but what was gain to the narrator? The Lord says—'Arjun! He who recites the verses of <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> for My devotees to listen will attain My state through his devotion. Thus, he doing so is My most favorite, such a dear to Me never was born ever nor would be in future, this is the utterance of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">A certain person has been indulging in spiritual discipline for fifty years, if his redemption lies in hearing the Lord's name by my effort to make him listen, along with him we also got emancipated the fruit of reciting the Name was also achieved.  </p>
<p class="Text">Our birth in the human body is for self emancipation. If there was no self-redemption but I did the highest welfare of others it was the self-redemption. He who fasting himself provides meals to others, is higher than he who appeases his own hunger. If we prove worthful to send thousands of men to the Vaikuntha and if we, ourselves, have to go to the hell, it is much higher than self attainment of the Vaikuntha, reaching the hell the highest good of the beings lying in the hell should be done. By doing so the status of the Lord will be got; because the Lord's work is to emancipate the souls and if he provides deliverance to the souls it means he is doing the work of the God and he is God. Such is the glory of telling the Lord's Name to a dying man. The worship of even twenty years cannot be fruitful so much as by making to listen the Lord's Name for five minutes to a dying man.  </p>
<p class="Text">After pondering over this matter it is concluded that leaving all the works this work should be done on the priority basis and to do so is higher and the best, it is even more than devotional song and communion with great souls. This is the highest, even more than salvation. Its glory is at the top. There lies the salvation of the dying man who passed away hearing the Lord's Name, and the one who makes him listen the Lord's Name, <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita </span>delivers him and does self-redemption also. This work carries the highest value, the effort should be made to reach out such an opportunity like a greedy man. To consider it the most valuable, the work to tell <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> and the Lord's Name to the dying man should be done. </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-35">Deliverance by repeating the Lord's Name to be heard by the dying man*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 22.5.1957, Morning 8:15 a.m., Batabriksha, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">To hear the news of the man who is on the verge of death, at once, the arrangement for loudly chanting divine names should be done. Everyone gets this last moment at the time of death for his emancipation, if you want to avail the opportunity of such a moment, join the loudly chanting of divine names going on near the dying man. All of them who have joined to chant the congregational chanting became entitled of deliverance. When any person who abets the murder is sentenced to death because of abeting the  murderer, Why will the deliverance not be possible for joining the group of the congregational singers to make the dying person listen? Go there and sit doggedly to let the dying man listen the Lord's Name. To spare time for this purpose is the most important matter.</p>
<p class="Text">For this purpose leave the adoration, meditation and religious congregation, leave even your most urgent piece of work, leave the other objects. This is the matter of first priority. At the time the fire having broken out, to run to extinguish the fire is the worldly gain, but to manage for the deliverance of the dying man is the spiritual gain. If you try to make to listen the Lord's Name to five persons who are at the edge of death and you succeed at a single place even then you are in gain. </p>
<p class="Text">(1) If the dying man is desirous to hear the Lord's name and the family members are agreed to make the dying man listen the congregational singing and Lord's Name—this is the number one work. </p>
<p class="Text">(2) When the dying man is out of senses, but the family members want to let the dying man hear the Lord's Name—this is number second. </p>
<p class="Text">(3) The dying man is interested to hear the Lord's Name but the family members don't want, even then if you make him hear the Lord's Name— this is the third number.</p>
<p class="Text">(4) The dying man does not want to hear the Lord's Name but the family members want to make him hear—this is number fourth.</p>
<p class="Text">You can go to this extent, but in the case none is interested for this then there is no way. If anyone approaches you to go and repeat the Lord's Name so that the Name of the Lord might reach the dying man's ears then you should think that there is the Lord's call for you.</p>
<p class="Text">The emotional men coming from the distant places consider Gita Press a pilgrimage. In reality this is not the holy place of pilgrimage, but for the devoted persons this proves to be beneficial according their emotional feeling. It is the emotional intention which is primary. As a matter of fact Gita Press belongs to the lord whether any one agrees or not, so here liberal and generous treatment should be given to the visitors and four points should be kept in mind love, politeness, sacrifice and to be free of arrogance.  </p>

<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. Ashadh Shukla 13, Samvat 2001 (Year 1944), Gorakhpur.</p>
<p class="Text">Man can take the benefit as much as he wants, it has no limit at all.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—Is profit more than salvation possible?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—Yes, it is possible. Till a single embodied being is there till then we can reap profit. The redemption of one's soul is not the end of evolution. Neither there is the end of our downfall nor progress. There is the end of uplift when all get salvation. </p>
<p class="Text">The noble sentiment never gives the bad result. So, the noble sentiment be inculcated in the mind. Namadevaji  saw the image of God even in a dog and its result was not bad. The sensual desires of the mind are the cause of downfall and not the taking everyone as God. </p>
<p class="Text">Prahalad thought of the Lord in the pillar, the Lord appeared. This is the fruit of the good sentiment. Despite having no self capacity to cause the other attain the Lord if the Lord makes us the instrument to cause the other attain the Supreme Being we should not deny. The Lord said—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘निमित्तमात्रं भव सव्यसाचिन्’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 11/33) 'Be you only an instrument Arjun.'</p>
<p class="Text">Man should not overestimate himself that he can do salvation to anyone. He who cherishes the feeling of arrogance that he can cause any other one to attain the Lord, he cannot do so, if one considers himself unable to cause anybody's emancipation, if any other one attributes him the merit that he can get the Lord attained to him, anyone can make in this way him the instrument he is free. If the Lord makes us instrument that I make you instrument for others to attain 'Me' then we should not deny.</p>
<p class="Text">The second notable point is that if the Lord does not use us as instrument then we ownself should become the instrument for this purpose and we should think that it is the Lord who has made us instrument. If the Lord says I did not give you this right' then you should say. You didn't give but I took it by force. As anyone is very close to death and he wants to hear the devotional song and the meditation by making you the instrument or he does not call us you yourself should be aggressive to say that should I make you hear the congregational singing? Should I tell you Gitaji? If he says, Yes make to hear me,' there you should become the instrument. In this way you devised four or five places and even a single man got deliverance, it means your life is fulfilled. The human body was attained to you for the deliverance of the life. You could not do self-welfare but you did good to other then it should not be remorseful to think that you're remained deprived of self-deliverance.</p>
<p class="Text">If anyone says that you have the capacity to do the emancipation then don't accept it. If anyone asks you 'Have you power to make anyone attain the Lord? Then, you should say—'No', I have no power, it is only the God by whose grace it can be possible.</p>
<p class="Text">If anybody asks you 'How should I be worthy of attaining  the Lord?' You should advise him seeking shelter to the Lord. How is seeking shelter to the God? Tell him clearly the ways to seek shelter. It is becoming the instrument. Don't be instrument thinking one self as capable. </p>
<p class="Text">If he makes you the cause of his deliverance, let him speak so, don't pay heed to it. Don't be puffed up with joy to hear his words of obligation to you. Someone appreciates and other calls you bad names don't listen to the both. </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-38">The treatments at the Time of Death </p>
<p class="Text">The family members of the dying man happen to do some such performances in the pretext of improving his spiritual evolution, which cause great pain to the dying man. So the following points need special attention—</p>
<p class="Text">(1) If the diseased is on the 2nd or third floor of the building there is no need to bring him down on the ground floor in this situation.</p>
<p class="Text">(2) If he is lying on the cot let him be remained there in the same condition.</p>
<p class="Text">(3) If there is any consideration of his death at the cot is not benedictory and the need is realized to bring him down on the ground from the bed then, with presumption let him be brought down from the cot two or four days before the death and let him be laid down on the sand spread on the ground. The sand should be so soft that it should not prick to his body. The presumption of the time of death should be made on the basis of the doctor's advice or symptoms of the body of the dying man or seeking from the old and experienced persons. If the diseased person is cured there is no objection to let him laid down on the cot again, if he dies earlier before the presumption there is no loss, but he has been saved from the suffering and pain what he feels laying him down on  the ground at the time of death,  two or four days before if the diseased one himself presumes his death, he should himself ask to get him brought down from the cot and let him be laid down on the ground. </p>
<p class="Text">(4) In such a case there is no need to bathe him before the death, it increases his suffering uselessly. If the faeces and urine are needed to be cleaned, slowly and slowly it should be cleaned very softly with the wet towels or cloth.   </p>
<p class="Text">(5) In such a condition to provide him 'Gangajala' (the water of Ganga) and Tulasi (basil leaf) is very good, but if he feels pain in swallowing up, Tulsi leaf, then having crushed Tulasi leaf (basil-leaf) and having mixed it with the water of Gangaji he should be made to drink. Not more than about 10-15 milimetre water should be given to him at one time. After ten to fifteen minutes that may be given again, the Gangajala (the water of the Ganga) should not be old and tasteless, first it should be tasted by self and then it should be given to the diseased person. That is what gives ill smell or what is bitter in taste should not be given. The fresh water of the Gangaji should be made available from anywhere. There is no question of purity or impurity or touchability in the 'Gangajal' (water of Gangaji). If the diseased has closed his mouth, nothing should be given to him.</p>
<p class="Text">(6) To sit near the diseased person the family affairs should not be narrated uselessly and the worldly affairs should not be reminded to him. The mother, wife, husband, son and any kith or kin should not express his or her sorrow to sit near him. By all means every type of service that is pleasant to his mind should be offered to him. </p>
<p class="Text">(7) Such allophatic medicines or any medicine which is mixed with impure objects, should not be given to him.</p>
<p class="Text">(8) So long as he is conscious he should be made to hear the recitation of Shri Gitaji with its meaning. When he becomes unconscious it is proper to repeat the Lord's Name near him. If there is no one to read the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita,</span> then from the beforehand let him be listened the Lord's Name. </p>
<p class="Text">(9) If the diseased person is the devotee of the God with form or formless then to the devotee of the 'Sakara' should be sighted the image or idol of the Lord with attributes and his glory should be related and if he is a lover of formless God then revolving the word bliss again and again the adjectives of the formless God should be caused to hear him such as pure, knowledge personified consciousness itself unborn immortal 'Sat', 'Chit', 'Nitya', 'Aja' etc. </p>
<p class="Text">(10) If he is to be taken away to Kashi or any other holy places of the pilgrimages, he should be asked. If he has longing. There remains no doubt about him to, reach there, there is the consent of the doctors and there is the capability to bear the expenses, then only he should be taken away there.</p>
<p class="Text">(11) Even after the death, the news should not be given to any one at least till fifteen or twenty minutes. Remain going on chanting the congregational singing of the Lord's Name so that the atmosphere there may remain Sattvic. There should not be cry of weeping as the wailing of that time is not good for the deceased soul. </p>
<p class="Text">(12) If the family members are wise they should not weep and the others should also not going there try to cause them weep through their words of sympathy only.</p>
<p class="Text">(13) The mourning symbol should be kept only for Twelve days.</p>
<p class="Text">(14) The death of the sons and daughters below the age of Twelve years should not be mourned at all.</p>
<p class="Text">(15) No condolence meeting should be held for the deceased but the meeting should be assembled for the carefulness of the self. This should be kept in mind that in the similar way I will also die one day.</p>
<p class="Text">(16) Never mourn at the death of the man who has become free from the cycle of birth and death while alive, to mourn at his death is his insult.</p>

It is our duty to remove this darkness of ignorance. We have not to attain the Lord in any other way than this. The Lord is always already attained to us we have to realize that God is attained. We have not to attain the unattained. That absolute truth and ocean of bliss Supreme Being is always and ever attained to all. To have such firm determination in the mind is to attain the Lord. After such a determination in mind the attainment of the perfect peace and Supreme state become apparent forever. If it is not so then there is lack of his faith.  </p>

Nobody dies by hearing <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>. That he was made to listen <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita </span>and now he will die. Remove this apprehension of mind, throw out this suspicion of mind from the house. Throwaway this weakness out of the country; make the practice of the Lord's adoration all of you should engage yourself in this performance. </p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-41">To make to listen the Lord's Name is the best work*</p>
<p class="writer">(Swami Ramsukh Dasji Maharaj)</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 10.8.2002, Afternoon 3:30, Gita Bhawan, Swargashrama, Rishikesh.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—We want the knowledge about the supreme service. Sethji had delivered in his sermons a lot for supreme service and used to encourage with the enthusiastic words to cause to hear the Lord's name to the dying man. Let us come to know something about the highest service from your mouth also, this is our humble prayer. </p>
<p class="Text">Answer—If anyone is dying, Sethji used to go there leaving the religious congregation even and Sethji has already said also to go there leaving all the works to cause him to listen to Lord's Name! He is departing for ever, first tell him the Lord's Name, leave the gathering of great souls, leave every work for his sake make him listen the Lord's Name, there used to be such utterance of Sethji.</p>
<p class="Text">Sethji has constituted 'Param Sewa Samiti' in Kolkata. The members of that society go, and serve the diseased person there where someone is ailing, they make him hear the Lord's Name, chant loudly God's names there, it is the fixed turn of two hours for the members. Here, also fix your turn, males for the males and if any females is ill the females should fix their turn, go there and chant the congregational singing for her to listen for two hours turn wise, chant the Lord's Name for her to listen, serve her. The service rendered to any diseased person is a great glorious work that is the service of the Lord, The Lord wants service, so serve the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—If he doesn't want to listen, then?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Create interest in listening God's name or <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—If he asks not to chant loudly but to speak mildly?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Then speak slowly and slowly but make him listen divine names.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—The man at the edge of death no doubt, wants to hear but if his family members and the men of neighborhood check it then what should we do?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Let them go on saying to stop, but you must make him listen.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—Should we not care for the words of the family members at that time?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Should not be cared for. If anyone reproaches, listen to but don't speak to him anything. Make him listen the Lord's Name, perform congregational singing, don't pay heed to the family members, if the dying man is interested, make him listen at all cost with great enthusiasm. If the family members disgrace you, insult you tolerate everything. Remain silent, don't speak to them. But you must make him, listen the Lord's Name. If anyone says—'What do you do this? You should say—'Brother, he wants to listen the Lord's Name, so, we are making him listen.</p>
<p class="Text">Listener—If any doctor makes objection why are you creating noise? But he is eager to listen then we should not care for the doctor's objection?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—When the doctor is there your tone should be low. When the doctor goes away then be loud. I have such an experience. It was the case of Gopaldas' mother in Kolkata, I at once, reached there on call. I heard someone saying 'Here is no policeman, otherwise he would have arrested him, he is making a noise near the man who is a patient. I realized that they did not want to listen about the Lord. I became silent. When they went away I again  started chanting and made him hear the Lord's Name, If the dying man is interested to hear the Lord's Name. You must make him listen. This is a good work, make a few to hear, he will come to remember the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Audience—Also to him who hears?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Yes, this is a very big noble deed, to remind the dying man Lord's Name is a great auspicious deed, he is departing from this world. Sethji used to leave the religious congregation to reach there.</p>
<p class="Text">Listener—Maharajji! Anyone used to go to 'Satsanga', but at the last stage of life his mind  gets disturbed, the disease overpowers him, if he denies to hear due to the deformation of his mind, should he cause to be heard the Lord's Name or not?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Go on repeating 'Rama Rama Rama' <span class="char-style-override-4">राम राम राम राम....</span> sitting near him, remain singing devotional song, it is also effective. We want his salvation, Now, if he does not hear, what can anyone do? You should chant the Lord's Name for him to hear, our job is to develop his devotion to the Lord by any means.</p>
<p class="Text">Listener—Maharaj! No doubt, the dying man denied to hear but the other lovers of 'Satsanga' are sitting near. Some of them are repeating 'Rama Rama' they are not repeating the name to make him hear. Will it prove beneficial to him?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Yes, it will prove beneficial. The messengers of Yama don't come there where the Lord's Name is being repeated. At the last time of Ajamil's Life due to the pronunciation of 'Narayana's Name, the messengers of Yama standing there had to bear the beating with the hands of the Lord's courtiers, so the messengers of Yama don't come there. Make him hear with great zeal. </p>
<p class="Text">Listener—Maharajji! Any person who used to go to 'Satsanga' asks his family members or the his friends—'Now, whatever I am saying that I am saying in the conscious state applying my mind and reason that if in my ailing condition my mind fails and if I stop you to repeat the Lord's Name, even then you so go on repeating the Name for me to listen, should they repeat the Name for him to listen to?</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—Yes, his intention is right and clear. He has love and devotion to the Lord's Name, you must make him hear.</p>
<p class="Text">Listener—Maharajji! Sometimes it occurs such mishapening that the dead man needs to be detained for the whole night, there the persons who go to make him hear divine names lack in zeal and so that the people in big number should go there to repeat the Lord's Name to be heard, there is found lack of zeal.</p>
<p class="Text">Swamiji—The enthusiasm should be inculcated, it should be maintained. He must be got heard the Name. The lover of  'Satsanga', the contemporary of Sethji was Mohanlalji Patawari who used to say—'If there is none in the night to repeat the Lord's Name to make anyone listen, enroll my name for that period. Tell me the time to chant the Lord's Name for anyone to hear when there is no one available. He had such a zeal in him. Previously it was more in practice to repeat the Lord's Name for the dying man to cause to hear, but it is not found so in the people now a days. Swami Shri Sharananandji said—'Here, in Gita Bhawan, Swargashrama there is the arrangement for death and also for the 'Satsanga' ( the sermons of Sethji). The dying man is made to hear the Lord's Name. such an arrangement is not everywhere for a dying man.</p>
<p class="Text">Engage yourself and persuade others also to engage themselves, don't invest your time anywhere else, invest it only in the Lord.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">शतं विहाय भोक्तव्यं सहस्रं स्नानमाचरेत्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">लक्षं विहाय दातव्यं कोटिं त्यक्त्वा हरिं स्मरेत्॥</p>
<p class="Text">Leaving crores of works engage yourself in the divine adoration, leaving thousands of work take bath, leaving lakhs of works make charity donation, leaving hundred of works take meals.</p>
<p class="Text">Make the dying man remember the Lord's Name, if the crores of works suffer let them suffer but repeat the Lord's Name to make him hear. This is the superior most job. If any other work suffers let it suffer, don't care for it. <span class="char-style-override-4">‘हरिस्मृति: सर्वविपद‍‍‍्िवमोक्षणम्’</span> 'The memory of the Lord destroys all the miseries.

<p class="writer">(Swami Ramsukhdasji Maharaj)</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Discourse, Dt. 3.10.1996, Afternoon 3:30, Fogla Ashrama, Vrindavan.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord's Name is unique. Its glory is boundless and unlimited. Goswami Tulasidasji Maharaj has discussed about the Lord and His Name both in a wonderful way in nine couplets in the context of 'Salutations to and the glory of the Name. He has gone to the extent to say that the Name is more valuable than Ramji even. In 'Ramcharitmanas' he has described in detail-</p>
<p class="SHLOK">राम एक तापस तिय तारी। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नाम कोटि खल कुमति सुधारी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Shriramcharitmanas, Bal.</span> 24/3)</p>
<p class="Text">'Shri Rama Himself redeemed a single woman (Ahilya), the wife of an ascetic, While his Name corrected the perversity of crores of wicked souls.' </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Shri Rama redeemed a single woman, wife of an ascetic, the wife of an ascetic is the half portion of the ascetic, being a wife of an ascetic already pious; she was not at all any fallen woman. His 'Name' has corrected the error of crores of wickeds and sinner souls, their wicked minds improved, their thoughts and wisdom improved again Goswamiji went  to the extent in the continuation of his statement—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">कहौं कहाँ लगि नाम बड़ाई। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रामु न सकहिं नाम गुन गाई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-3">Shriramcharitmanas, Bal.</span> 26/4)</p>
<p class="Text">'I have no words to depict the glory of the 'Name; not even Rama can adequately glorify it'.</p>
<p class="Text">Even the power of the Lord gets exhausted while singing the glory of His Name, the Lord is infinite so also His Name is infinite, how should I end the endless? The glory of the name is beyond limit. You must have heard the episode of Ajamil, there Parikshit got perplexed how would so much heap of sorrow of the hell be removed? The ocean of sorrow will be crossed by the virtue of the Lord's Name. Gentlemen! Just the moment you hear the glory of the Lord's Name. Absorb your mind in the Lord's Name only, he who becomes absorbed in the Lord's name to hear the glory of the Name, heard the glory of the Lord's Name, otherwise, he did not listen.</p>
<p class="Text">For example, we make any complain to the government but the action is not taken on the complain, then we say that action was not taken. In the same way, those who don't engage themselves in repeating the Name earnestly even after hearing the glory of the Name, did not hear the glory of the Name, no action was taken there. The glory of the Name is realized by repeating the Name, only by listening the meagre interest is created, but by repeating the Name we experience it and it is not possible by hearing only. Well enough!. Just when you hear the glory of the Name, engage yourself earnestly in repeating the Lord's Name constantly. As the round ball of sweet- meat looks good in look; but it is how much tasty it is we know while consuming it is not so in the mere look. Likewise by the practice of repeating the Name its glory is known.</p>
<p class="Text">There is a Sanskrit book named—Bhagawannam Kaumadi ! The glory of the Name has been very well sung in it. Here in this book there in the reference of the special opportunity that if any sudden calamity befalls or death approaches and to get rid of this misery is difficult, if the Name of the Lord is remembered at that time for that time the value of Name is much, because at that time all our instincts gather together, stop functioning and he becomes supportless, Ajamil has no support, he has no way to protect himself, in such a helpless condition, He called his son by his name 'Narayan'. Such a story is heard about Ajamil that a saint had visited the city named Kanyakubjanagar (the present name is Kannauj). The saint asked some persons there—'Brother! Is there any family in this village of a noble person who is the devotee of God and noble thoughts? Where I may pass my night? The persons there cut a joke with him that Ajamil was a great devotee in that village. The saint was of simple nature, believing their words he sat down at the gate of Ajamil outside in his wait. Ajamil came and asked him 'Maharaj! What is your motive to come here? The saint said—'Brother! I have come here to hear your name. There were sitting a few persons here. They told me that Ajamila was a great devotee; so I have come here to hear your name.'</p>
<p class="Text">Ajamil thought to himself that the saint was misguided and he reached there in deception. He said clearly—'Maharaj! No doubt, I am a Brahman, but my manner of eating and drinking all are lower graded and mean. I am a mean and fallen down, today you visited here, share my meal.' The Maharaj said—'Brother! I will not accept your meal. By eating the grain of such a fallen down I will also become mean and fallen down, so I will not eat. Ajamil made earnest request—'Anyhow please agree to me. I may arrange somewhere even to get your food cooked with purity. The saint said—'If you agree to me what I say, I can accept your request.' Ajamil said—'I will accept your advice but you tell to worship God, it will not be possible by me. I remain loaded with the works of domestic affairs, I don't get time. If you ask me to sit with rosary and take divine Name, it will not be possible by me. I am a householder, I have wife and sons. I have to pull on the family.' The saint said—'Do one thing only that you will name your son 'Narayan' who is to be born. He accepted this condition. There was the sentiment in the mind of the saint to liberate him and the deliverance was possible by the Lord's Name. By the grace of the saint the name 'Narayan given by the saint was the name of his son. There remains the great affection in the heart of the mother-father for their youngest son, so he would call his name with his whole-hearted affection. At the time of death Ajamil had no support, no helper, no protector. He called only the name of his son—'Narayan! Narayan! Narayan! This was the name of only four letters. Four courtiers came upon. At the time of death, Lord's Name has its special glory. Having been disappointed from all sides if the Lord's Name is remembered only once our purpose is served.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">जब लग गज अपनो बल बरत्यो </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नेक सरॺो नहिं काम। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">निर्बल है बल राम पुकारॺो </p>
<p class="SHLOK">आयो आधे नाम॥</p>
<p class="Text">'So long as the celebrated elephant used his own power he failed in his protection. But being helpless when he called the Name of the Lord he could take only half of the Name of the Lord Rama, God appeased and protected him.'</p>
<p class="Text">Just the moment 'Rama' was pronounced all his instincts were concentrated to the Lord exclusively having been diverted from all the sides. <span class="char-style-override-4">‘एक भरोसो एक बल एक आस बिस्वास।’</span></p>
<p class="Text">'Only single support, only single Power, and only single hope and faith. With this exclusive feeling the elephant developed such feeling.'</p>
<p class="Text">In Ajamil's mind while calling 'Narayan' the sense is of his son, but his protection is made by the Lord, Narayan, he pronounced 'Narayan' at the last time of his death. Man is blessed with the human body only for self-deliverance. <span class="char-style-override-4">‘एहि तन कर फल बिषय न भाई।’</span> 'Brother! You have got this human body not to enjoy the worldly objects but for your deliverance.' The worldly enjoyments are short lived. So, repeat the Lord's Name and practice the exercise of devotional song in the praise of the Lord throughout your life make yourself engaged totally in your effort to attain the Supreme Being. Don't waste this human body in earning money and enjoying the worldly enjoyments because this human body is to attain the Supreme Being. Among the eighty four lakhs classes of births it is only the human body which is entitled of the Lord's attainment. Even the gods are deprived of this right what is allotted to mankind Having attained such a rare human body it is better to engage ourselves in divine adoration. <span class="char-style-override-4">‘अनित्यमसुखं लोकमिमं प्राप्य भजस्व माम्’</span> 'Having spared yourself from the short lived enjoyments and pleasures of this world think of Me only and only alone.' This worldly pleasure is ephemeral, there is no joy here, having got this human body adore Me and think of Me only and always sing My praise, this human body is to serve this purpose, so absorb yourself in the Lord the whole day and night. When Ajamil heard the glory of the Name from the mouth of the Lord's courtiers, he left his wife, son and home and set out for Haridwar and reaching there he absorbed himself in repeating the Lord's Name. This is called the impact of hearing. After such performance the Lord is not unobtainable at all By the pronunciation of 'Name' only the messengers of Yama ran away. I have heard such more examples, recently even in the period of my remaining alive these—occurrences have taken place, messengers of Yama came to carry away someone, he called the Lord's Name abruptly being restless and the messengers of Yama ran away. Whoever saw the messengers of Yama, he called God's name and the messengers ran away. By repeating God's name there is protection with rememberance of God's name who have been liberated there may be hundreds of men.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">चहुँ जुग चहुँ श्रुति नाम प्रभाऊ। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कलि बिसेष नहिं आन उपाऊ॥</p>
<p class="Text">In the Kaliyuga the glory of the 'name' is especially significant. In all the four ages and in all the Vedas the glory and influence of Name has been described but in Kaliyuga the Name is more valuable. There is no other way in the Kaliyuga. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has stated—<span class="char-style-override-4">नाम्नामकारि बहुधा निजसर्वशक्तिः तत्रार्पिता नियमितः स्मरणे न कालः।'</span> 'Just in the beginning of Kaliyuga the Lord empowered the 'Name' with his entire power, He did not have any binding of rule in remembering the Lord's Name. Everyone is free to remember. His Name anytime with morning, noon, evening, night or day time. Everyone is free to repeat Lord's Name any time in the twenty four hours. There is no restriction for any one of any caste and creed, he may be a Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra, woman, man learned, illiterate, Hindu, Muslim, Christian anyone.</p>
<p class="Text">If the Lord's Name is remembered with the whole-hearted emotion and concentration of mind, it is more valuable. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">गुप्त अकाम निरन्तर ध्यानसहित सानन्द।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">आदरयुक्त सबसे तुरत पाये परमानन्द॥</p>
<p class="Text">'It any remembers the Lord secretly, without any selfish motive, constantly and, with concentration, with joy and with a great reverence, he at once attains the Supreme Bliss.' </p>
<p class="Text">These six points together have their prompt effect in giving gain especially. The value of Name decreases when it is propagated what he remembers the Lord's Name for so many times, the people should know that he mutters the Lord's Name, he is the lover of the Lord's Name, if such intention is there in the mind the value of Name deceases, the muttering of the Name should be performed with unselfish motive. One who repeats God's name for his daughter's marriage, or to get a lot of wealth he sells the Lord's Name. The Lord's Name should be repeated unselfishly. His Name should be remembered only for the pleasure of the Lord and it should be repeated constantly. It is not proper to repeat the Lord's Name for some time and then leave it and again repeated for some time and then left it again. As the mothers cook food and if they burn the fire of the kitchens for ten to fifteen minutes and then, they leave for half and hour and they again lit the fire of the kitchen after ten minutes and then again leave it, by this practice the day will pass away but the meals will not be cooked. If they cook in continuation the food will be prepared very soon. Similarly the Lord's Name should be repeated constantly. The Lord's Name should be remembered every moment even while eating drinking, sleeping awaking, walking-moving, sitting-standing every time.  </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रामनाम निशदिन रहे आठों पहर अखंड। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">रामदास उस संतका नाम न छोड़े संग॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Lord's Name should be repeated daily all the twenty-four hours without break. If here is anyone who repeats the Lord's Name in such a way. 'Ramadasji' says that the company of that saint the name does not discard.'</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Ramaji never leaves him who does not leave the muttering of His Name, Ramji accompanies him always. So long as any one remembers the Lord's Name when he is conscious, and is in his senses in the last at the time of death if he becomes unconscious like the dry wood, the Lord's says—'then, I remember him at that time'. So long as he remains conscious he does not leave to remember My Name, the Lord says—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span> 4/11)</p>
<p class="Text">'Arjun, howsoever men seek Me, even so do I approach them'. He is unconscious he remembered the Lord when he was conscious, now he became unconscious, the Lord is never unconscious. The Lord grants him his desired fruit. The Name is omnipotent; His glory is boundless and unlimited, such is this Lord's Name! And in the age of Kali specially there is the special glory. This is the holy place of Vrindavan, there is the special gain by the muttering of Name in His abode. </p>
<p class="Text">As we do farming, where there is the fertile land, the production is much higher, likewise this place which is the holy place of pilgrimage. This is Lord's abode.</p>
<p class="Text">This is Vrindavan, if we adore God here, it has the special spiritual importance. If the sin is committed here its result is very dreadful. Where there is the good land there are also the grass, plants, and thorny trees like Acacia trees of big thorns. The pious land is fruitful to all. As one sows so shall he reap. So, one should remain very cautious at the holy places of pilgrimage and cautiously make the practice of divine worship. The sins committed at the holy place become thunderbolt. Make the chanting of divine names at the places of pilgrimage very cautiously. At such pious places we should repeat the Lord's Name, visit the Lord's idols and hear the fables relating to the Lord. </p>

<p class="Text">'With their mind fixed on Me, and their lives surrendered to Me.' If seeking shelter to the Lord only, if seeking shelter to His Name only all the purposes will be served, all the purposes are served only to remember the Lord's Name. One may be illiterate knowing nothing even then the Lord's Name serves his all purposes. </p>
<p class="SHLOK">चारों वेद ठिठोर के अन्त कहोगे राम।</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सो रज्जब पहले कहो इतने में ही काम॥</p>
<p class="Text">'Having examined all the four Vedas at last it is the Name of Rama only that will serve your Supreme goal. So it is better to remember that Lord Rama earlier and your all the purposes will be served.'</p>
<p class="Text">Be absorbed in repeating the Lord's Name day and night always,. Here, it is the Lord's grace that the Lord's name is being preached and the publicity is being made here. A number of brothers and sisters remember the Lord's Name here. Here, they remain muttering the Lord's Name having the bag of rosary with them. This is the highly sacred place; this is the land of the Lord's frolicsome activities this is an extraordinary divine place. To reach here at this place and to adore the Lord through the devotional song has a special significance, to hear fables of the Lord has also a great importance. This place provides power, energy and prowess. Gentlemen! He who remembers the Lord's Name has no anxiety for any other object. With great zeal and enthusiasm remain repeating the Lord's Name. The Lord's Name should give you sweet relish and should be dear to you.</p>
<p class="Text">Gentlemen brothers-sisters! Demand from the Lord but the worldly objects are not worth demanding, it is the talks relating to Lord are to the demanded. O Lord! May your Name be sweet to us. May your Name be interesting to us! May Your Name be dear to us! May we not forget your Name! O Lord! May I be absorbed in Your Name! This is worth demanding. No other objects need to be demanded from the Lord at all. Demand love from the Lord, the knowledge is not to be demanded. May we be absorbed in the Lord's contemplation, May the Lord's Name be dear to us, May His abode be dear us, May His fables be dear to our ears! May the Ganga and Yamuna also be dear to us because of being related to the Lord! All those objects that are related to the Lord are the deliverance providing. You heard the episode of Ajamila. Listen to my one prayer or more. If any being is just nearing death, sit there and make him listen the Lord's Name. It may be any living being but the human being has his special importance. Anyone whether a child, old or young if he is at the stage of death, any one diseased, healthy whosoever the may be if he is at the stage of death make him listen the Lord's Name at the time of his death. If has its own glory. He attains his supreme goal by making him hear the Lord's Name. What a glorious deed it is to feed a starving man all that food which was only sufficient to appease his own hunger! This human body is blessed to us only to attain the Supreme Being, if anyone resounds the ears of dying man with the Lord's Name at the time of his death, his self deliverance can be possible. </p>

This is your son, grandson, grand grandson your son-in-law has reached—never remind him these all. Only relate him the Lord's Name—Rama Rama  Rama Rama <span class="char-style-override-4">राम राम राम राम....</span> Please, listen to with attention!

The Lord waits till the last moment that you might think of Him and you night remember His Name and your emancipation might be done, this exemption is only at the last time of death and you may avail this exemption only once. The Man dies only once and not twice at all. But the opportunity to make the dying man listen the Lord's Name can be available to you several times. If anyone is to die let him be heard the Lord's Name by you. The listener will attain his supreme goal free of cost. By doing so the Lord is impressed that I am almighty Lord is capable to do anything but I do not make effort from My side for the deliverance of the people. On the other hand this poor very nominal in power in spite of being a human being tries to liberate others that there might be the highest good of others' considering it my ideal I should follow it and do so. But if I don't do so at least I should try to do the redemption of the Listener. God makes the effort of the man's successful who makes other one listen the Lord's Name. It came to your mind. By doing so the Lord is impressed that he has no capacity, he is not omniscient, not omnipotent, not supremely compassionate and I am all powerful the most compassionate and Omniscient, in spite of being less powerful and less competent he relates the Lord's Name to others for their deliverance. If he liberates other  I will emancipate him at least. By doing so it has a great impact on the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">This  is unique that there is such a committee in Kolkata. The residents of Kolkata know it. There is a society named 'Govind Bhawan' consisting of several members. The members of the committee here have the objective that if there is anyone ill anywhere, let it be informed to the members of the committee, the men of the society reach there and they make him hear the Lord's Name by repeating, His Name fondly all twenty-fours as their turn wise duty of two hours, To repeat the Lord's Name to be heard all twenty-four hours and donate their services for getting nothing, such is the objective of that society. They don't take even water but make the dying man listen the Lord's Name; such is that society. Mohanlaji Patwari was such among them who expressed his strong will to chant the Lord's Name to make the dying man listen from 12 O'clock to 2 O'clock in the night which used to be difficult time for others. </p>
<p class="Text">He used to say that there were several instances before his sight when the man at the stage of death had departed from this body, Those members of the society repeat the Lord's Name all twenty-four hours for that dying man to listen the Name and the soul departs from this body at any time during the twenty-four hours and for that purpose of chanting he who remains very enthusiastic the Lord awards him opportunity. So, how to make the deliverance of everyone possible? For this purpose repeat the Lord's Name to cause him hear. Here is the reference of Karnwas—A dog ran after a cat and he scratched the cat to catch it. My fellow disciple took away that cat on the bank of the Ganga and remained relating the Lord's name, and in the mean time while relating the cat died, then he set afloat away the cat in the Gangaji. When any living being (creature) dies cow, buffalo, sheep, goat, dog, donkey, and you make it listen the Lord's Name, the messengers of Yama don't come there. Such a reference is found in <span class="char-style-override-3">Vishnupuran</span>, in the sixth Sakandh of <span class="char-style-override-3">Bhagawat </span>and also in the <span class="char-style-override-3">Kashikhand</span> of <span class="char-style-override-3">Skandhpuran</span>. The Lord Yama instructs his messengers not to approach that place where the Lord's Name is being repeated, there will be insult, such is his command. So, make him hear the Lord's Name loudly to anyone who is just to depart from this body whosoever there may be anyone. This is very simple.</p>

What an excellence comes to him who remembers the Lord's Name! In the Kaliyuga, the 'Name' Has its typical glory.

<p class="Text">Naradaji asked for the boon of 'Rama's name to be the supreme from the Lord, so the glory of Ram's name has its special significance. The persons who remembered Rama's Name became great souls (Mahatma) and eminent saints, strange change came in them. Gentlemen! Engage yourself in the devotion of the Lord's Name. How easy, simple and accessible is the Name—Rama! There was one Kothariji in Kolkata, he was old, he happened to suffer from the paralysis attack, so he could not speak. I went to him even then, he uttered 'Rama-Rama' to see me. Even in the condition of paralysis attack if the Rama's Name is uttered, then, how easy and accessible is Rama's Name! In paralysis the tongue then gets stuck. Then one cannot speak even then Rama Name is uttered so much easy and simple it. It is so much glorious! So, every man should be devoted to utter Rama's name always. If it suits you then mutter 'Hare Rama, Hare Rama <span class="char-style-override-4">‘हरे राम हरे राम....’</span> or <span class="char-style-override-4">‘नम: शिवाय’</span> mutter<span class="char-style-override-4"> </span>'Namah Shivaya' Whatever different names of God engage yourself in pronouncing any one name of the Lord. What is dear to you in what you have faith with love and devotion. This is the opportunity for you to remember the Lord's Name, it is not known when this body may perish. <span class="char-style-override-4">‘मारहि काल अचान चपेट की होइ घरीकमें राखकी ढेरी।’</span> 'Death is inevitable. There is the sudden attack of death and within a moment this body perishes to the heap of ashes.' Death is but sure, so till there is breath in your body, till these eyes are twinkling, till you are in motion, engage yourself in the Lord's devotion. Will you dig the well, when the house has caught the fire and burnt to ashes? Now, what is the use to dig the well for? So, remember the Lord's Name beforehand pass your whole time day and night in the Lord's love. Lord's Name does not come to the memory of a sinner. If the Lord's name comes to your mind then think that it is  the Lord's special grace. The king of vulture Jatayu also says to the Lord—</p>

<p class="Text">Such is the glory of the Name. If you were unaware of it previously then be aware now. The founder, the patron, the director of Gita Press was Shri Jaydayalji Goyandaka. He has mentioned at three or four places—as much gain I achieved from the Lord's Name so much gain I could get nowhere except the Gitaji. The Lord's Name and Gitaji proves the most beneficent to him. We should also mutter the Lord's Name and study the <span class="char-style-override-3">Gita</span>. He said openly and clearly—“The gain what I achieved so much from the Lord's Name which is impossible for me to describe in words. You would have already read in 'Tattva Chintamani'.

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-43">The glory of the Lord's Name in Shrimad Bhagawat Mahapurana</p>
<p class="Text-Black">(Ajamil's Episode)</p>
<p class="Text">The King (Parikshit) said—the Path of Nivritti (cessation from worldly activity, has been duly delineated by your revered self, following which final beatitude (in the form of non-return to this world) is attained along with Brahma (the creator) when He (Brahma) has been reached by gradual stages (Such as the attainment of the abode of the fire-god). (1) And the path characterized by worldly activity has also been described (by you in book iii), (Venerable) sage—the path which has for its goal (the attainment of) heavenly and other sense—delights (the product of the three Gunas) and which leads to repeated embodiment through the (same Gunas (for the enjoyment of such pleasures)  in the case of the Jivas on whom Prakriti has not ceased her hold. (2) The various regions of hell which are symbolic of unrighteousness, have also been depicted by you. And so has been told at length (by you in book IV) the story of the first Manvantara, over which presided (the Manu called) Swayambhuva (Son of Brahma, the self-born) and so the posterity of Praiyavrata and Uttanapad as well as the story of (both) these kings. You have also narrated how the almightily Lord brought in to existence the (seven) Dwipas (the principal division of Earth's Surface) and (as many) oceans, as well as the mountains, and  rivers, gardens and trees, the disposition of the terrestrial globe—with (special) reference to its divisions of, their distinctive character and extent and (likewise) of the luminaries and the Subterranean regions (3—5). Now be pleased to explain to me, o highly blessed one, how a man in this world can (manage to) escape from hell, full of various horrible tortures. (6)</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shuka replied—If a man does not atone during his very lifetime and in the proper way (as laid down in the scriptures such as Manusmriti) for sins committed (by him) with his mind, speech and hands (body), he inevitably and actually goes after death to the infernal regions, that have already been described by me to you, and which are provided with means of severe torments. (7) Therefore, with a body not (Yel) incapacitated (for penance), one should take prompt measures here, even before death, for the atonement of one's sins, after weighting the gravity and lightness of the crime, just as a physician who knows the cause of maladies would adopt prompt remedies before it is too late, duly considering the seriousness or mildness of a complaint. (8) </p>
<p class="Text">The king said—Since a man, though knowing a sin to be hurtful to his self on the testimony of what is actually seen and heard by him, repeats it (even after atoning for it) having lost control (over his self), how could there be (any) atonement (for his sins) under the circumstances (so long as the sinful propensity is there? (9) Now he is absolved from a sin and now he does it again. Such being the case, I account (all) atonement fruitless like the bath of an elephant (which throws dust on it body immediately after it has washed itself. (10)</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shuka replied—Indeed the counter action of a (sinful) act through (another) action (by way of penance is not accepted as radical since there is every possibility of a man's falling back into sin even after the process of expiation has been undergone, so long as he is identified with the body), the ignorant those identified with the body alone being qualified for it (the expiatory process). Self knowledge (alone) is (therefore) the (true) atonement for it is knowledge alone which eradicates ignorance, the root of sin). (11) Maladies do not actually attack him who eats only wholesome food. In the same way, he who practises self-discipline, O King gradually becomes qualified for blessedness (final beatitude). (12) Through concentration of mind, continence, Subjugation of the mind and control of the external Indriyas (the senses of perception and the organs of action), charity, truthfulness and purity (of body and mind, the vows of non-violence etc. And sacred observances (such as the muttering of prayers) the wise, who are conversant with (the spirit of) Dharma (righteousness) and full of reverence are able to get rid of even the vilest sin committed through body, speech and mind just as fire destroys a (whole) thicket of bamboos. (13-14) A few (rarely blessed) souls, who are devoted to Lord Vasudeva destroy their sins completely (with their very roots in the form of ignorance) through mere devotion even as the sun destroys mist in its entirety. (15) Indeed a sinner, O king, is not purified so well through asceticism and other (expiatory) proceses as the one who had dedicated his (very) life to Shri Krishna through the constant service of His devotees. (16) For in this world the path (of devotion) is the best of all, in that it is full of bliss because it has no fear from any quarter. On the Path Tread pious (desireless souls who are amiably (kindly) disposed towards all and devoted to Bhagavan Narayan. (17) All Sorts of atonements done fail to purity in a thorough way, O Parikshit, him who has turned his face away from Bhagavan Narayan, even as (a number of) rivers (combined) cannot purify a jar of wine. (18) They who have (but) once in their life fixed on the lotus feet of Lord Shri Krshna their mind, that has conceived an attachment for his excellences never behold even in a dream Yama (the god of retribution) and his servants, carrying a noose (in their hand) since they have actually done (all) atonement. (19) </p>
<p class="Text">Parikshit! Further, as an illustration on this point, the learned narrate the following old legend, in which there occurs a conversation between the messengers of Lord Vishnu and Yama, (Now) hear it from me. (20) In (the city of) Kanyakubja (the modern name Kannauj) there lived a certain Brahman, Ajamil by name, who had kept a maid servant (a woman of the servant class) and polluted by intercourse cohabitation) with that Shudra woman, had cast to the winds (all) pious conduct (enjoined on a Brahman householder). (21) Making a reproachful living by robbery, gambling, cheating and theft and (thus) maintaining his family, the impious fellow tortured (put to death) living beings (and supported his family on their flesh when food could not be got by other means). (22) As he thus maintained (his) existence, fondling the (many) offspring of that Shudra woman, O king, a considerable period, equivalent to eighty eight years of his life, rolled by. (23) The old man had ten sons (by that woman: he who was the youngest of them, Narayan by name, was yet a child and was (therefore) greatly loved by his parents. (24) Having fastened his heart on that sweetly lisping infant, the old fellow felt extremely delighted while watching its sports. (25) Feeding it while (himself) taking his meals or chewing anything (by way of refreshment), and giving it water to drink while (himself) drinking it, bound as he was by (ties of) love to the child, the silly man did not perceive (the hour of) death, which had (now) arrived. (26)</p>
<p class="Text">Thus continuing, the fool thought of his juvenile son named Narayan, when the hour of death (actually) arrived. (27) Beholding three most terrible male figures with dry faces and hair standing on end, that had come to take him, noose in his hand. Ajamil, (greatly) agitated in mind, called by name his son, Named Narayan. Who was busy with (his) playthings away at (some) distance (from him), in a loud and lengthened tone. (28-29) Hearing the loud utterances of Shri Hari's (blessed name by the dying man (Ajamil), who was calling (though unconsciously) the name of their Master (Bhagawan Narayan), O great King, His attendants rushed to the spot (there) all of a sudden. (30) The messengers of Lord Vishnu stopped by force the servants of Yama, that were (at that moment) tearing (the subtle body) of Ajamil, who had kept a maid-servant. (31) (thus) forbidden, the servants of Yama said to them, Who are you that (thus) interfere with the authority of Yama (the deity presiding over righteousness)? (32) Whose representative are you or whence have you come, and wherefore do you forbid his being taken away (by us)? Are you (some) gods or demigods or some foremost Siddhas (a class of demi-gods endowed with mystic powers by their very birth)? (33) With eyes resembling the petals of lotus and clad in yellow silk, you are all adorned with a diadem, a pair of ear-rings and a shining wreath of lotuses (34) Besides, you are all in the bloom of youth and all possessed of four lovely arms and graced with a bow, quiver, sword, mace, conch, discuss and lutus. (35) Driving away the darkness of the quarters and overshadowing (all) other (material) lights by your splendour, what for do you hinder us, the servants of Yama (the protector of virtue)? (36) Shri Shuka continued—Parikshit! In reply to the aforesaid questions asked by those messengers of Yama, the servants of Lord Vasudeva heartily laughed and addressed the following (words) to them in a voice (deep) as the rumbling of clouds. (37)</p>
<p class="Text">The messengers of Vasudeva (Vishnu) said—If you are really servants of Yama (the deity presiding over righteousness). (Please) tell us the true character of virtue and also tell us the means of ascertaining it. (38) How is punishment meted out and who is intended to be its object? Are all the doers subject to punishment or (only) some (doers of the human species? (39)</p>
<p class="Text">The messengers of Yama replied—Dharma (righteousness) is (that which is) enjoined by the Veda and the reverse of it (that which is forbidden by the Veda is Adhrama (unrigheousness). And we have heard (from Yama and others) that the Veda is Bhagavan Narayan Himself (from whom it has emanated) and self-born (in the sense that it flows from His nostrils by way of respiration without any conscious effort on His Part) (40) It is by Narayan that all these existences (living beings) made up of (the three modes of Prakriti, viz.,) <span class="char-style-override-3">Sattva, Rajas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-3">Tamas</span>, are duly evolved in his own being with (their distinctive) Qualities, denominations, activities and forms. (41) The sun, the fire, the sky, the air, the indriyas (The senses of perception and the organs of action) the moon, Time, the morning and evening, twilights day and night, the (four) quarters, water, the earth Time and Dharma (the god of piety) these indeed are the witnesses of (the good and evil actions of) unrighteousness as ascertained by the evidence of a Jiva (an embodied soul). (42) These are determined to be a fit occassion for punishment. And all doers (without distinction deserve punishment in consideration of their (sinful) actions. (43) For good as well as evil deeds are capable of being done by men given to action, O sinless ones, in as much as they are (ever) associated with the three Gunas (modes of prakriti) and no one invested with a body can help doing action (with one's mind, speech or body) (44) He alone by whom a virtuous or sinful act was perfomed in this world reaps in the other world the fruit of it in the same manner and to the same extent it was actually done. (45) Just as in this world, O jewels among gods there are found three varieties of living beings (viz., those living a life of ease, Those dragging a miserable existence and those who are partly happy and partly miserable or again those who are tranquil by nature, those who are ferocious and those who are dull,or, according to a third classification, those who are pious by temperament, those who are vicious by nature and those who are of a mixed temperament and as this heterogeneity can not be explained except by assuring that the said three types of beings severally performed meritorious, sinful and mixed deeds in the past?), so from the diversity (in the proportion) of the three Gunas (manifested in the form of virtuous, sinful and mixed types of actions on the part of men in this world) it is inferred that they will reap the three corresponding types of fruit (in the form of happiness misery and a mixture of both) in another life. (46) (Again) just as a current period of time indicates the characteristics of the past as well as the future rounds of the same period so the current life (of a man) is illustrative of the merits and the sins of the past as well as of the future incarnations. (47) (Our Master) the Omniscient Yama who is (another) Brahma (as it were clearly perceives (while) at his (own) capital (Simyamani) by his very mind the former state of existence including the record of virtuous and sinful deeds) of a departed soul and reflects with his mind on his future ( destiny) too. (48) (Even) as a man in sleep (the dream state) treats as his self the body revealed in the dream alone and not the one existing before the dream state nor that which will follow the dream state, so the ignorant Jiva (too) identifies it self with its existing psycho physical organism (the one revealed by the past actions) alone and has no knowledge of the one preceding it nor of the succeeding one, having lost all memory of its past incarnation. (49) The Jiva, itself constituting the seventeenth principle (over and above the sixteen constitutents of the subtle body, with which it stands identified, viz, the ten indriyas, the mind the fire objects of senses, viz., the subtle elements) discharges its own functions of grasping things, locomotion and so on) with the five organs of actions, perceives the five objects of senses with the five senses of perception and experiences with the sixteenth (viz., the mind) the threefold objects of the senses of the perception, the organs of action and the mind all alone. (50) The well known subtle body, consisting of (the aforesaid) sixteen parts and a product of the three Gunas is beginningless and exceedingly  tenacious, subjects the Jiva again and again to transmigration, which is a source of joy and sorrow, fear and affliction (51) The ignorant Jiva (wich stands identified with a body and) that has not subdued the five senses of perception and the mind is prompted (by that subtle body) to fall back upon action, though unwilling (to do so), and veiling itself with a network of Karma even as a silk worm wraps itself in a cocoon, stands bewildered (finding no way out of it). (52) Indeed none remains actionless at anytime even for an instant: for everyone is forcibly impelled by attachment etc., (born of the three Gunas—Sattva, Rajas and Tamasa and) resulting from the impressions of past actions—to do action against his will (53) Having found an occasion in the form Merit or sin resulting from one's past actions a psycho-physical organism (consisting of a gross and a subtle body) actually moulds itself either after the womb (the mother's body) or after the seed (the body of the father) according to the irresistible tendencies of the Jiva (occupying it) (54) thus degradation of the soul (in the shape of loss of its blissful character and its being reduced to a wretched state as a result of identifying itself with a psycho physical organism) has been due to its association with Prakriti (Matter) (And) the degeneration ceases before long through devotion to God (and by no other means). (55) </p>
<p class="Text">Gods! You already know that this fellow (Ajamil) Was indeed endowed with learning (the knowledge of the Vedas and other scriptures) a (vertitable) abode of amiabiltiy, good conduct and virtues (like forgiveness) had taken a vow of worship, prayer and so on and controlled his senses, was gentle (and) truthful well versed in sacred formulas and pure (in habits) (56) (Nay) he worshipped the sacred five (viz., pouring oblations into it) and served his preceptor strangers (calling at his house) and elders, was a friend to all living bengs, free from egotism, pious, taciturn and uncavilling (by nature) (57) One day, this Brahman went to the woods in obedience to his father's command and as he returned therefrom taking fruits, flowers, wood for the sacrificial fire and Kush grass, he saw (on the way) a (most) profligate Shudra who was almost libidinous and shameless fellow, drunk with liquor, sporting with a harlot of the same class who was not only (similarly) drunk, with her eyes swinging through intoxication but stood by his side in a half naked condition (with the knot of her loin cloth loosened and (also) singing and joking with her (58—60). Seeing her folded in the arm of that Shudra, which was painted with unguents exciting lust this man (Ajamil) was inspired with extravagant passion and succumbed to (the darts of) love all at once (61) Though controlling his mind by recourse to reason with all his firmness and by dint of his learning, he could not compose it, agitated as it was with love. (62) Possessed by the devil of love excited by (the sight of) that (lewd) woman, and (thus) deprived of reason and thinking of her alone with his mind he actually deviated from his duty (neglected all his sacred obligations). (63) With the entire fortune of his father (at his disposal) he indulged  her alone through carnal pleasures delightful to her mind so that she might be pleased (with him). (64) The sinful fellow, whose judgment had been crippled by the side glance of that lewd woman, abandoned before long his own wedded wife, a Brahman girl, still in the prime of youth and bestowed on him (by her father) in view of his noble (pedigree) (65) (Having spent on her all the fortune of his father) this stupid fellow brought money from here and there by fair and foul mens and maintained the family (progeny) of this woman, who was (soon) the mother of many children. (66) Because this fellow who having violated (the injunctions of the scriptures, acted according to his own will and was (therefore) censured by (all) worthy men led a sinful life an lived for a long time in an impure state; eating the food polluted by the touch of a harlot, we shall accordingly take  this sinner, who has done no atonement (for his crimes so far) to the presence of Yama (who wields the rod of punishment), where he will be purified through punishment (67-78).</p>
<p class="Text">The messengers of Lord Vishnu expound the <span class="char-style-override-3">Bhagawata Dharma</span> (the cult of Devotion) and Ajamil ascends to the Lord's Supreme abode.</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shuka went on Having thus heard on (duly) followed the dissertation of the messengers of Yama, the aforesaid messengers of the Lord, who were masters of the moral science, now replied to them (as follows)—O king (Parikshit!). (1)</p>
<p class="Text">The messengers of Vishnu said—Oh, what a pity that unrighteousness should penetrate the court of the knower's of Dharma (the secret of virtue) Where punishment is unnecessarily inflicted by those very knowers of Dharma on sinless people who do not deserve any punishment! (2) If inequity appears in (the heart of) those who are  protectors (like a father) and teachers of the people and are beneficent and evenminded (to all), whom shall the people resort to for protection? (3) Whatever a superior man does, that very thing the common (ignorant) man (also) does. The people (at large) follow that which the former sets up as a standard (to be followed) (4) Like a brute, the common man himself has no knowledge of righteousness or unrighteousness and (generally) sleeps at ease (over this question), resting his head on the lap (utterly depending on the wisdom) of another (his ruler or preceptor) (5) how can it be worthy of the latter, if he is full of compassion and deserves the confidence of (all) living beings, to seek to harm the unwary world that has thrown itself entirely at his mercy, reposing (full) trust on him? (6)</p>
<p class="Text">This man has actually done atonement (not only for the sins of this life but) even for sins committed (by him) through millions of lives (in the past) in that he uttered, though in a helpless state, the name of Shri Hari, which (apart from its being the highest atonement for past sins is a (direct) means to the attainment of (Supreme) felicity (the final beatitude). (7) The atonement for (all) the sins of this (erstwhile) sinner must have been made by the mere semblance of the four-syllabled name of the Lord 'Narayan' while exclaiming (calling his son in the word) 'Narayan, come (here!) (8) The articulation of a names of Lord Vishnu—That is the only thorough atonement for the sins of all classes of sinners, be he a thief, a drinker (of spirituous liquor) one guiltily of treachery to a friend, a Brahman slayer, one sharing the bed of a preceptor's wife, a slayer of a woman, a king, one's own parent or a cow and whatever other (types of) sinners there may be for thereby (by the utterance of the Lord's name) the Lord's (own) mind is directed towards the uttered (Who is thenceforward  remembered by him as His protege). (9-10) </p>
<p class="Text">A sinner is not purified to that extent (so thoroughly) through fasting and other processes of expiation recommended by the expositors of the Veda (Manu and others) as he is by words standing as names for Shri Hari, articulated (merely with the tongue); for the utterance of such words puts him in mind of the (divine) attributes of the glorious Lord and thus qualifies the man for final beatitude by drawing him towards the Lord, the Bestower of Liberation, unlike the other forms of expiation, which exhaust themselves in wiping out the sins). (11) For, the process of expiation is not complete if one's mind runs back to evil ways even after the said process has been gone through. Therefore, in the case of those seeking the eradication of their (stock of) sinful Karma the uttering of the praises of Shri Hari is the only remedy; for the same undoubtedly purifies the mind. (12) </p>
<p class="Text">Therefore, O the messengers of Yama! Do not take, by a wrong path (the path of the sinners), (the soul of) this man, who has done atonement for all (his) sins in that he articulated the Lord's name in full (while as a matter of fact, it wipes out one's sins even when uttered in part) and at a time when he was about to die (When there was no possibility of his reverting to the path of sin and there by incurring any more sin, for one can not ordinarily be expected to take the Lord's name precisely at the moment of death). (13)</p>
<p class="Text">The learned recognize the articulation of a name of Lord Vishnu as capable of eradicating all one's sins even when it is intended to denote someone else, or when it is uttered jestingly in love and not jeeringly) or as an interjection in the midst of a song or out of (seeming) disrespect (but not real); for disrespect actually shown to the Lord or a Jeer flung at them constitutes in itself an unpardonable sin) (14) A man who articulates the word 'Hari' (or for) that matter, any other name of the Lord even) involuntarily (without any conscious effort on his part when fallen down, stumbled, bitten (by a snake or any other poisonous creature) heated (by fever etc.), injured (by a blow) or when he has broken a limb no longer deserves (to suffer) torment (in hell). (15) Arduous and easy processes of expiation have been thoughtfully prescribed by the great sages (law givers) in the case of (comparatively) great and small sins. (16) Those sins are (certainly) got rid of by the said processes of expiation such as austere penance, charity and Jap (muttering of prayers) but not the Kernal (vestiges in the form of impressions) of those sins, which is (also) traceable to the unrighteous acts. Those impressions too are obliterated through the service of (devotion to) the Lord feet. (17) Any name of the Lord excellent renown, which is distinctly pronounced (by a man)—(whether) knowing (with the consciousness that it wipes out all one's sins or unknowingly (without such knowledge)—destroys a man's sins (as surely) as a fire consumes the fuel (under all circumstances, no matter whether it has been kindled by a man who know its burning  properties or by an innocent child who is unaware of the burning capacity). (18) Just as a medicine passing the highest potency is sure to produce the salutary effect even on one who is unaware of its efficacy, though taken by chance so does the Lord's* name (which is a holy as any sacred text or formula) reveal its efficacy (in the shape of wiping out all one's sins) even in the case of him who is unaware of it, when uttered by him (even) casually.

<p class="xfootnote">Yet the God devotee beings should not be more serious about the destruction of the sins; they should be more serious for the firmness to their devotional love and the gradual increase in their love to the Lord's feet.

As much their selflessness grows so much the perfection of the Name will go on revealing, and experienced.</p>
<p class="xfootnote">A number of logicians are of the opinion on the basis of their reasoning that the glory of the Name is not so factual, that is merely eulogism. Though this mentality is formed in his mind after all that even a drop of wine is sufficient for the down fall of a man, but this confidence does not develop in min Merely a single name of the Lord is highly beneficent.

<p class="Text">Shri Shuka resumed—Having thus expounded in a well-reasoned and conclusive way to cult of devotion to the Lord (with particular reference to the marvellous efficacy of the Divine (Name), O king (Parikshit) and extricated the said Brahman (Ajamil) from the noose of Yama (the god of punishment), the messengers of Lord Vishnu secured his release from (the grip of) death. (20) Thus, foiled in controversy (by the Lord's own messengers), the messengers of Yama returned to the presence of Yama (their master) and faithfully reported everything to king Yama, O subduer of foes. (21) </p>
<p class="Text">Disentangled from the noose (of Yama) and rid of fear. The Brahman (Ajamil again became healthy and pious as before) and delighted with their sight, bowed his head to the servants of Lord Vishnu. (22) Perceiving him eager to speak, the servants of Lord Vishnu (the Supreme Person) suddenly disappeared at that (very) spot, even as he looked on. O sinless one Parikshit. (23) Here Ajamil heard an exposition of the pure cult of devotion from the messengers of the Lord and the path of worldly activities which is a product of the three Gunas as depicted in the Vedas through the servants of Yama. Ajamil too now soon conceived devotion to the Lord as a result of hearing the glories of Shri Hari (the Destroyer of sins) and great was his repetance as he recollected his (past) sins. (24-25) (He said to himself) I am a great slave of the senses. Oh, it was the worst tragedy for me, who forfeited my Brahmanhood by giving birth to son through a Shudra maidservant. (26) Fie upon my wicked self condemned by (all) saintly men, the blot of my race, who kept an unchaste wench given to drinking, having abandoned a faithful wife who was yet very young. (27) Oh, my aged parents who were without a protector and no other relation (such as a son) and were much afflicted (because of me), were forthwith deserted by my ungrateful self as by a vile man. (28) As such I will surely fall into a most dreadful hell, where lustful men, who have violated Dharma (righteousness) suffer tortures inflicted by Yama. (29) </p>
<p class="Text">'Was (all) this wonder seen by me in a dream or with my own eyes here (in waking life)? Where have they now gone, who proceeded to tear me (my life) from my body, noose in hand? (30) Again, where have those four angelic, persons gone who were (so) good-looking and got me released while I was being taken to the infernal regions (situated below the earth) fastened with noose. (31) Though I have been so accursed (in my present birth), yet I must have earned (in my pervious lives) some extraordinary merit which blessed me with the sight of those foremost gods as a result of which my mind is so calm and cheerful (today). (32) I am a debauchee and quite unpious fellow. Otherwise my tongue was not fit to utter the fascinating name of Lord Vishnu—In case I had not done some virtuous deed in previous birth at a time when I was at the verge of death. (33) The two stood poles asunder—myself, a wicked swindler, lost to (all) shame, who violated his Brahmanhood, and the other (most) auspicious name of the Lord 'Narayan'. (34) Having controlled my mind, Indriyas (the senses of perception as well as the organs of action) and breath, I shall as such so endeavour that I may not drown myself in the blinding gloom of transmigration again. (35) Having got rid of mundance existence—so well known (in the shape of ties of attachment to son, wife, house ands so on) and resulting from ignorance (manifested in the form of self-identification with the body etc.), and from the craving for the gratification of senses and activity (in the shape of endeavour to procure such gratification)—benevolent to all living beings, free from craving for the pleasures of sense, friendly and compassionate (to all) and with (my) mind fully controlled, I shall redeem myself, completely dominated as I am by the Lord's Maya (deluding potency) in the shape of woman by whom my wretched self has indeed been fully toyed with even as an animal kept for pleasure. (36-37) Giving up the sense of 'I' and 'mine' in relation serverally to the body and whatever is connected with it, and with my thought fixed on the real substance (the Spirit), I shall devote my mind to the almighty Lord when it has been purified by chanting His names and praises and other ways of devotion (such as hearing His praises and remembering Him). (38)</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shuka began again—Having thus conceived a thorough aversion to the pleasures of sense, thanks to a moment association' with the pious servants of Lord Vishnu, and throwing of all fetters (in the shape of affection for his mistress and children), Ajamil retired to Gangadwar (the sacred spot where the holy ganga descends into  the plains, and which is now known by the name of Hari Kshetra or Haridwara). (39)  Sitting down at the holy place (an eternal abode of the Lord) and be-taking himself to the path of Yoga, he withdrew all his senses (from the objects and merged them in the mind and merged the mind into the intellect then dissociating the intellect from sense objects through concentration of the self and devoted it to the supreme Brahma who is realization itself. (41) When his intellect was (thus) irrevocably was fixed on the aforesaid Brahma (trancending Prakriti) comprising three Gunas, fixed on the aforesaid Brahma, he held in front of him the same (angelic persons and recognizing them, as seen—before, bowed his head to them. (42) Having quitted his (earthly) body at that sacred place (Gangadwara) on the bank of the (holy) Ganga (immediately) after their sight, he forthwith assumed a (divine) body similar to the form of the Lord's attendants. (43) Mounting the aerial car made of gold the Brahmana (Ajamila) ascended with those attendants of Lord Vishnu (the Supreme person) through the sky, to the (Divine) realm (known by the name Vaikuntha where resides the Spouse of Shri (the goddess of beauty and prosperity) (44)</p>
<p class="Text">In this way that Brahman, who, consequent on his having kept a woman of the menial class had transgressed all his sacred duties and broken his vows of (of fidelity to his wife and so on) and who had not ony fallen (from his Brahmanhood) due to his reprehensible conduct but was going to be cast to hell (by the servants of Yama) was at once completely freed (from the noose of Yama) by uttering the Divine Name. (45) For those seeking liberation there is nothing more efficacious in cutting the root of sin (in the form of identification with the body) than chanting the Name and glories of Lord Vishnu (whose feet purify those who resort to them). Thanks to the chanting of His names the mind does not (ordinarily) get attached to (sinful) actions again, whereas it remains tainted with Rajas and Tanasa (Even) after purificatory processes other than this have been gone through. (46)</p>
<p class="Text">He who, full of reverence hears this legend which is a most profound secret (of the scriptures) and is capable of destroying (all) one's sins, as well as he who repeats it with devotion (after hearing it) never goes to hell nor dare the servants of Yama look at him. However accursed (sinful) he may have been, such as mortal is adored (hereafter) in Vaikuntha (the realm of Lord Vishnu). (47-48) </p>
<p class="Text">Even (a great sinner like) Ajamil, who uttered, while dying (in a helpless state without reverence) the name of Shri Hari and that too in its Secondary application as denoting his son, ascended to the Lord's (divine) Abode! What wonder, then, if one who pronounces it with reverence should attain to His abode? (49)</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading">A dialogue between Yama and his messengers</p>
<p class="Text">The king Parikshit said—what did the god yama under whose sway over all this creation is and whose authority was thus obstructed, say in reply to his servants who had been foiled by the messengers of Lord Vishnu—on hearing their report? (1) (such) Supersession of the authority of the glorious Yama at the hands of another was never heard of before, O (holy) sage! (and) none other than you can resolve the doubt which will arise in the popular mind on this point; that is my conviction.(2) </p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shuka replied—The messengers of Yama whose efforts were interrupted by the attendants of the Lord, O King, submitted to their master, Yama, the ruler of the (city of) Samyamani (as follows) (3) </p>
<p class="Text">The messengers of Yama said—How many in the world are the rulers of human beings performing actions of three kinds Virtuous, sinful and of a mixed type)—rulers who are responsible for the manifestation (dispensation) of their fruit? (4) If there be in the world many a ruler wielding the rod of punishment, who would suffer death and who would enjoy immortality or heavenly bliss. Management would not be equitable. (5) This would result in a complete deadlock. If there be plurality of rulers in this world for the vast number of men engaged in action, their authority will exist only merely in name. Such authority would be only secondary Like that enjoyed by tributary chiefs. (6) We assume that you are the one supreme Lord and ruler of all living beings—capable of distinguishing the merit and sins of man and wielding the rod of punishment (7) Such as you are, your authority stands superseded and no longer prevails in the world today, as is evidenced by the fact that your command was set at naught by four wonderful angelic persons. (8) They forcibly released  a sinner who was being taken by us under your order to the infernal regions, cutting the noose. (9) We are keen to know the particulars about them from you, if you deem it good for us. It was very strange that the moment the word Narayan; was uttered by Ajamil they hastened in saying 'Do not be afraid'. Fear not. (10)</p>
<p class="Text">Shri Shuka continued—thus interrogated the celebrated god Yama, the controller of living beings, was delighted and replied to his messengers, contemplating on the lotus feet of Shri Hari. (11)</p>
<p class="Text">Yama said—The Supreme Lord of the mobile and immobile creation is other than me. It is by him that the whole universe stands pervaded on all sides as a piece of cloth by its warp and woof. (Nay) it is from His part Manifestations (Brahma, Vishnu and Shiv) that the evolution, maintenance and dissolution of this universe proceed and the creation is subject to his control even as a bullock tied with a string passed through its nostrils is controlled by the man holding the string. (12) Just as a farmer ties (his) oxen with tethers to a big cord, He binds men with different denominations (Brahmans, Kshatriyas and so on) as enjoined by the Vedas; and bound by strong ties in the shape of class names and obligations, the aforesaid men meticulously bear offerings to Him. (13) Myself, the mighty Indra, Nirriti, Varuna, The moon-god, the god to fire, Lord Shiv, the god of air, the sun god, Brahma (the creator) the sons of Aditi, the Vishwedwas, the (eight) Vasus, and (the groups of gods called) the Sadhyas, the (forty-nine) Marutas (wind gods), the (eleven) Rudras along with the Siddhas, the creators the world like (the sage) Bhrigu, the rulers (adored) of gods and others too who are untainted with Rajas and Tamasa and in whom Sattva predominates have no knowledge of His intention—dominated as they are by His Maya (deluding potency)—much less those other than these. (14-15) Even as colours (the objects of sight) cannot perceive the faculty of vision, which reveals them, the Jivas cannot grasp or reach with (their) senses of perception, mind or organs of action nor with (their/intellect or speech Him who is the seer of all living beings, though dwelling in their very heart. (16) Charming messengers of the above mentioned Shri Hari, the Supreme person, the absolute and transcendent Lord, the controller of Maya (Prakriti), generally go about in this world endowed as they are with a form, virtues and disposition similar to those of their (Divine) Master. (17) Those most wonderful servants of Lord Vishnu, Who are adored by the gods even and whose forms cannot be easily perceived (by earthly beings) protect mortals devoted to the Lord from enemies as well from myself (Death), fire, from everyone else. (18) </p>
<p class="Text">As a matter of fact, neither seers nor even gods nor the foremost Siddha can precisely know ( the secret of) virtue (as) expounded by the Lord Himself, how, then, can the demons, human beings, Vidyadharas (celestial artistes Charanas (heaventy bards) and others know it? (19) Brahma (the self-born), the sage narada, Lord Shiva, the sage Santkumar, Lord Kapil, Swayambhu Manu, Prahlad, kind Janaka, Bhishma, the demon king Bali, the sages Shuka and myself (Yama) these twelve (alone) know (the essence of Dharma as taught by the Lord—secret pure and difficult to understand—by knowing which one enjoys immortality, the final beatitude. (20-21) To develop loving attachment to the Lord through the utterance of His Name and so on—this alone has been declared to be the paramount duty of (all men in this world. (22) Realize, my boys, the glory of uttering the name of Shri Hari, by which alone (pronounced) unintentionally once only) even a vile sinner like Ajamil was liberated from the noose of death. (23) To celebrate duly the virtues and exploits of the Lord and to chant His name—this much is not needed for merely wiping out the sins of men! For even the most sinful Ajamil attained liberation by simply calling his son at the pitch of his voice as Narayan while on the verge of death (When neither his body nor his mind was in sound condition) (24) Alas! The average learned man whose thought is focussed on (the teachings) of the three Vedas, full of sweet and attractive encomiums generally does not realize the aforesaid glory of the Divine Name, and remains engaged in grand sacrificial undertakings. (25) </p>
<p class="Text">Pondering thus, the wise indeed resort with an undivided mind to the practices (the chanting of the Divine Name and so on) making for loving Devotion to the Lord possessing infinite virtues. They do not merit punishment at my hands. Firstly they never commits sins and even if a sin is ever committed by them, the utterance of the name of Lord obliterates it, the utterance of the Name of Lord obliterates them. (26) the sacred stories of those pious souls who regard all with the same eye and have taken refuge in the Lord are constantly sung even by the gods and Siddhas. Never approach such men, protected as they are by mace of Shri Hari. Neither we nor the time-spirit has the power to punish them. (27) Bring those impious men who are averse to the joy inhering in the honey like sweetness of the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu—incessantly tasted by flocks of noblest swans in the form of ascetics of the highest order, who have nothing to call their own and who are connoisseurs of sweetness and have given their heart to the delights of home life which lead one to hell, (28) (Further) bring those wicked fellows whose tongue neither recounts the virtues nor utters the name of the Lord, whose mind never contemplates on His lotus-feet and whose head does not bow even once to Shri krshna, and who have never rendered (any) service to the Lord Vishnu. (29) Ah, may that most ancient person Bhagawan Narayan, put up with the offence committed, through the instrumentally of our messengers, by ourselves, His ignorant servants, Who Crave His forgiveness with joined palms, for forgiveness (alone) becomes the greatest of the great, Hail to the all pervading Supreme Person. (30) </p>
<p class="Text">(Shri Shuka Continues)—Therefore, O Parikshit! Know the chanting of the names and praises of Lord Vishnu as a source of blessing to the (whole) world and the complete atonement for the greatest sins. (31) The mind is not purified so well through fasting and other means as through devotion easily engendered in the heart of those who repeatedly hear or narrate the accounts of the extraordinary exploits of Shri Hari. (32) He who enjoys like a bee the sweetness of Shri/Shri Krishna lotus-feet, delights no more in the enjoyments brought forth by Maya (Prakriti). Once, they have been given up by him as conducive to suffering. The other man consequently who is buffeted by desires takes to action (alone in the shape of an expiatory process) in order to atone for his sin—action which leads only to sin again. (33) </p>
<p class="Text">Parikshit! When the messengers of Yama heard from his Master's (Yama own mouth the greatness of the Lord, depicted by their master thus, and realized it their wonder had no limit. Since then believing on Yama's words, afraid of men depending on the immortal Lord (Vishnu) they shuddered even to look at them from that moment. (34) O dear Parikshit! Dwelling on (the summit of) Mount Malaya and worshipping Shri Hari the glorious age Agastya, Narrated (to me) this secret legend.
