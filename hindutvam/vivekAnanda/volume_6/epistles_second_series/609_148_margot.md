## CXLVIII

RIDGELY.  
*1st Nov., 1899.*

DEAR MARGOT, (Margaret E. Noble or Sister Nivedita)

. . . It seems there is a gloom over your mind. Never mind, nothing is
to last for ever. Anyhow life is not eternal. I am so, so thankful for
it. Suffering is the lot of the world's best and bravest — yet, for
aeons yet — till things are righted; if possible, here — at least it is
a discipline which breaks the dream. In my sane moments I rejoice for my
sufferings. Some one must suffer here; — I am glad it is I, amongst
others of nature's sacrifices.

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA.
