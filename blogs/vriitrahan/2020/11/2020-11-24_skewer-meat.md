yat-what, te-your, gātrād pacyamānād – from limb being cooked, agninā –
by fire, abhi – upon, śūlam – spit/spike, nihatasya – of smitten,
avadhāvati – dropping down, mā – not, tad – that, bhūmyām – on earth, ā
śriṣat – let it scatter, mā – not, tṛṇeṣu – in grasses, devebhyaḥ – to
the gods, tad – that, uśadbhyaḥ – desiring, rātam – bestowing, astu –
let it be

“That \[thing\] which drops down from your limb being cooked by the
fire, \[you who is\] impaled upon the skewer. Do not let it scatter on
the earth, not in the grasses. Let it be given to the desiring Gods.”

Here, we see the meat of the limb of the horse cut up for sacrifice was
being cooked on a śūla (a skewer/spit) and later offered to the Gods,
before being consumed. This along with a reference of skewered meat in
the Mahābhārata tells us that skewer roasted meat, now commonly called
as kabab by the islamicized, was known and oft consumed back then.
