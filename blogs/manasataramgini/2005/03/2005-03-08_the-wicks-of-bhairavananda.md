title = "The wicks of bhairavAnanda"

+++
Having worshipped krodhabhairava and offered his arghya to
shikhAshekhara, bhairavAnanda obtained the four wicks of atyendrajAla.
These wicks he handed over to the 4 seekers of wealth. This tale is all
only too well known to all our compatriots.

Now there is another one. somAkhya had visited the 3: ishAnashiva,
vimalashambhu and ugratANDavadeva. They gave somAkhya the wick of
jha\~NkArabhairava. somAkhya carrying that wick wandered widely for many
years on the hills such as hanumat parvata, pAShaNDa parvata, durgA
parvata, umA parvata and vetAla parvata. During these wanderings the
only voice he heard was that of a talking goose. Finally after
descending from the parvatas and suffering intensely in his travels he
was walking along the plains of vimAnasthala when his wick suddenly
dropped. somAkhya vigorously dug at the spot and obtained a load of
copper. Carrying this copper with difficutly he placed at a shed in his
dwelling. Then he visited vimalashambhu and asked what he may do with
the copper. vimalashambhu answered: Perform yoga, you may be able make
use of the copper.
