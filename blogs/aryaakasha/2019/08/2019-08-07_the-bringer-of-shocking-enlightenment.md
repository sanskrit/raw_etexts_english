Vishnu-posting? On a Wednesday? ON MY WALL?? It’s more likely than you
think!

“You can run on for a long time \[…\] Sooner or later God’ll cut you
down” – Johnny Cash, ‘God’s Gonna Cut You Down’

“The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities
of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men;  
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will  
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness –  
For he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children;

And I will strike down upon thee with Great Vengeance and Fuuurious
Anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers  
And you will know My Name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
thee”  
– Ezekiel 25:17; The Gospel According to Taranis of Tino.

‘VidyuDabhi’, the name of Parashurama’s Mighty Axe, is another one of
those excellent Sanskrit Divine Weapon names that is … difficult to
succinctly render into English. Dabhi connotes the sense of ‘giving’ or
‘bestowing’, but ‘Vidyu’ occupies a curious interposition between
‘Vidya’ (as in ‘Wisdom’, ‘Revelation’, ‘Insight’ – you can see the “Vid”
particle, related to ‘Seeing’, quite clearly there); and ‘Vidyut’ …
which means \*Lightning\* \[As well as, more literally, the quality of
emitting light; and, for that matter, ‘electrifying’, or bearing a
charge\]. I have tried to emanate this dual sense of the term, which
helps to convey the force of revelation that hits one as a thunderbolt,
in my rendering of “Shocking Enlightenment”. There is also, for good
measure, a ‘Yudh’ in there as well. In all cases, a veer-y excellent and
apt weapon for the Lord of the Howling of the Storm!

The Tale of the bearer of this severely excellent axe, Parashurama, is a
fascinating one – and not least because it speaks of an Avatar of Vishnu
\[hence my posting on a Wednesday\], Who is amongst the foremost
Devotees of Lord Shiva \[hence why He was given one of Shiva’s Axes; and
also my posting on a Wednesday\], and Who is a Brahmin by Birth … Who
wages a genocidal campaign of extirpation against the Kshatriyas of this
world after an unvirtuous member of the latter caste wrongs His mortal
father.

To me, Parashurama has represented a singular truth: that the mind and
soul and might of a Brahmin, especially when angered, is truly one of
the mightiest and most terrific forces in the triuniverse. Capable of
the most incredible feats and otherwise, erstwile impossible deeds,
should he or she be sufficiently motivated to put their mind, body, and
being to it.

To quote the warning words of Markandeya to Yudhisthra in the
Mahabharat:

“Being immortal I have many a time beheld and otherwise ascertained the
courses of the world. \[…\] NEVER do thou humiliate a Brahmana, for a
Brahmana, if angry, may by his vow destroy the three worlds.”

Now, it is also necessary at this point to address the fact that the
weapon in question is an Axe. Which, in addition to being one of the
favoured weapons of Rudra \[and thusly, wielded also by Shiva’s
Emanations of VeeraBhadra, KaalBhairav; as well as Shiva’s ‘other half’,
the awe-inspiringly martially proficient Goddess Durga\] … is also what
we have taken to referring to as a ‘Roudran Theological Argument’.

You see, at several places within the relevant corpuses and canon of
Hindu mythoreligion, an axe-wound rather decisively settles the vexed
matter of just who is superior to whom, and puts to an end such
egregious instances of impious or otherwise iniquitable conduct that
might yet be occurring.

In the case of KaalBhairav, it is the Decapitation of Brahma with just
such an Axe which brings to an end the latter’s pretense of being an
equal to, or greater than, in either case, an usurper of Lord Shiva’s
cosmic throne and portfolio of responsibilities. In an older account, it
is Rudra’s employment of the eloquence of the Axe that excoriates Brahma
for another sin. And in the course of the Vayu Purana \[as also related
via the Vishnu Purana, interestingly enough\], we see the Axe wielded by
VeeraBhadra, against the Horse-Sacrifice of Daksha, and also thence
against Brahma’s descendant, who had been engaged not only in the
conduct that, per other Puranic accounts, lead to the Death of Lady
Sati, but in these instances \*also\* entailed the exaltation of Vishnu
as being of supremacy over Shiva whilst almost totally excluding the
latter from the pious veneration that was His Noble & Lordly Due.

Asal Uttar, also the name of one of the most famous battles between
India and Pakistan, means something akin to ‘Decisive Answer’, or
‘Proper Response’. To these situations of escalated impiety and moral
degradation, the “Enlightenment” promised and thence delivered via the
Axe, was just such an Enunciation.

A ‘Doom’, in the older Germanic sense – a Judgement, a Sentence upon
Them.

The utilization of the Axe in just such a manner is also implicitly #NAS
– although in a display of perhaps unexpected restraint, there is
Ancient Viking Wisdom suggesting that it is not \*always\* the Argument
of First Resort, whether in law-courts or in the relevant Icelandic
equivalent to Parliament.

From the Vatnsdaela Saga, Powers Translation:

‘Jokul: “It seems to me that never before has any man ever spoken at the
Assembly who has been hit in the face with an Axe”

Thorstein: “While that may be true Jokul, I think we should continue to
search for other solutions to this problem.”‘

To quote, in closing, my favourite lines from the aforementioned Puranic
account \[H.H. Wilson translated rendering\]:

“Vírabhadra said, ‘I am not a god, nor an Áditya; nor am I come hither
for enjoyment, nor curious to behold the chiefs of the divinities: know
that I am come to destroy the sacrifice of Daksha, and that I am called
Vírabhadra, the issue of the wrath of Rudra. Bhadrakálí also, who has
sprung from the anger of Deví, is sent here by the god of gods to
destroy this rite. Take refuge, king of kings, with him who is the lord
of Umá; for better is the anger of Rudra than the blessings of other
gods.'”

Also, Johnny Cash again:

“Well, you may throw your rock and hide your hand  
Workin’ in the dark against your fellow man  
But as sure as God made black \[काल\] and white \[गौर\]  
What’s down in the dark will be brought to the light  
\[…\]  
Sooner or later God’ll cut you down”

जय परशुराम

Jai Sri Rudra !!!
