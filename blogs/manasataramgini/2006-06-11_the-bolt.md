The news reached us that rakShohA agni had cleared 3 of the vR^itra and
nirR^iti had gone back her way. We thought the clouds were clearing. But
Fourier’s man, who was feared as shUravarman, got the news too. Never
had he been intimidated thus or his men faced such uchChATana-s. He
accordingly released the deadly “crane arrow”. Never was balance between
life and death so clear.

Past mid-night we faced the terror of the crane. Never had anything been
so directly threatening in our existence. As yudhiShThira said when yama
visit yonder man we think he is not for us, but when he comes your own
way we experience his real fear.
