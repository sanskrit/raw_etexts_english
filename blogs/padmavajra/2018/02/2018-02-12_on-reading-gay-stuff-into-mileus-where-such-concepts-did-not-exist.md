This is not to say men who were attracted to men did not exist. They
have existed since at least the dawn of agriculture in humankind.The
definition of gay=attracted to men(and a community that defined itself
like that) arose in only the 1920s-1930s Anglo-European world. Before
that,there were people attracted to men in the US who would fuck
straight men(or as the slang went, ‘trade’). Then people who had
feminine mannerisms,and dressed such. Men who fucked other men. None of
them came under that modern ‘gay’ label(as defining oneself/having an
identity based on the sex one is attracted to). I am basing this on my
reading of Foucault and George Chancey’s *Gay New York:Gender,Urban
Culture and the making of the Gay male world 1890-1940.*

Secondly,I would find it grossly wrong to elevate a engendered in a
situation like that-Would you endorse buying someone as your
property,cutting off his balls and using him as your toy for sexual
satisfaction?That’s essentially how the relationship began. There are
better gay icons/icons with ambiguous sexuality in the past to look
forward to,like Walt Whitman,etc.
