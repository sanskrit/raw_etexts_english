title = "Notes on miscellaneous brāhmaṇa passages from the Yajurveda"

+++
The upasthāna ritual is performed to let the sacrificial fire remain in
residence after the primary oblations are complete. In the triple-fire
śrauta rite this is done at the āhavanīya altar with several
incantations specified in the saṃhitā-s of the Yajurveda, e.g.
Taittirīya-Saṃhitā 1.5.5. Among those incantations the following is
recited:

indhānās tvā śataṃ himā dyumantaḥ samidhīmahi ।  
vayasvanto vasyaskṛtaṃ yaśasvanto yaśaskṛtaṃ ॥  
suvīrāso adābhyam agne sapatna-dambhanaṃ varṣiṣṭhe adhi nāke ॥

Kindling you, may we kindle \[you\] in luster through a hundred snows
\[winters\].  
The strong one the maker of strength, the famous one the maker of
fame.  
With good heroes, the undeceived, O Agni, the deceiver of foes in the
highest heaven.

The Taittirīya-Saṃhitā furnishes the following brāhmaṇa passage for the
above mantra-s (In TS 1.5.7):

indhānās tvā śataṃ himā ity āha । śatāyuḥ puruṣaḥ śatendriya
āyuṣyevendriye prati tiṣṭhati । eṣā vai sūrmī karṇakāvatī । etayā ha
sma vai devā asurāṇāṃ śatatarhāṃ stṛṃhanti । yad etayā samidham ā
dadhāti vajram evaitac chataghīṃ yajamāno bhrātṛvyāya pra harati stṛtyā
achaṃbaṭkāram ।

He recites: “may we kindle \[you\] through a hundred snows \[winters\]”.
He lives a hundred years and has a hundred senses. Verily he is stable
in life and senses. This is a red-hot tube with cutting edges. By this
indeed the deva-s have struck hundreds of piercings on the asura-s. When
he takes up the fire-stick with this \[incantation\], the ritualist
hurls the śataghnī like the vajra for his enemy’s overthrow without
fail.

The text is notable in being, what to our knowledge, the earliest
mention and description of the weapon frequently encountered in the
itihāsa-s and purāṇa-s and also found in the Arthaśāstra of Viṣṇugupta
Cāṇakya. The weapon is described as being a sūrmī, which tradition holds
to be a red-hot hollow cylinder. It is described as being karṇakāvati,
i.e. with prongs or cutting edges. As its name goes, śataghnī, and from
the description of the attack by the deva-s on the asura-s in this
brāhmaṇa, it is clear that it was intended to be a weapon of “mass
destruction”. Thus, it is reminiscent of what the braḥmaṇa-s are
described as having deployed on the Egyptian Herakles by Flavius
Philostratus in his biography of Apollonius of Tyna. It is in this
context that he says that if Alexander had penetrated beyond the Vipāśā
river he might have not been able to take the fort of Indians even if he
had 10000 Achilles-es and 30000 Ajax-es with him. Given that the
itihāsa-s mention it as being used as a mechanical device for the
defense of forts it is likely that it was indeed some form a siege
engine of the early Arya-s.

For the same incantation the Maitrāyaṇī-Saṃhitā (in MS 1.5.2.8) gives a
rather different explanation:

manor ha vai daśa jāyā āsan । daśaputrā । navaputrā । aṣṭaputrā ।
saptaputrā । ṣaṭputrā । pañcaputrā । catuṣputrā । triputrā । dviputrā ।
ekaputrā । ye nava āsan tān eka upasamakrāmat । ye aṣṭau tān dvau । ye
sapta tān trayaḥ । ye ṣaṭ tān catvāraḥ । atha vai pañca eva pañca āsan ।
tā imāḥ pañca । daśata imān pañca nirabhajan । yad eva kiṃ ca manoḥ svam
āsīt । tasmāt te vai manum eva upādhāvan । manau anāthanta । tebhya etāḥ
samidhaḥ prāyacchat । tābhir vai te tān nirādahan । tābhir enān
parābhāvayan । parā pāpmānaṃ bhātṛvyaṃ bhāvayati ya evaṃ vidvān etāḥ
samidha ādadhāti ।

Manu indeed had 10 wives. \[Respectively,\] with 10 sons, with 9 sons,
with 8 sons, with 7 sons, with 6 sons, with 5 sons, with 4 sons, with 3
sons, with 2 sons, with 1 son. The 1 son \[of the wife with 1\] joined
with the 9 sons \[of the wife with 9\]; Those of the she with 2 sons
with those of she with 8 sons; 3 sons with 7 sons; 4 sons with 6 sons.
The 5 \[of she with\] 5 remained that. They were just 5. The 10s (i.e.
50) dispossessed these 5. Now Manu had some \[possession\] of his own.
Therefore, those \[5\] indeed ran to Manu himself. The sought protection
in Manu. He gave each these fire-sticks. With those \[fire-sticks\] the
\[5 sons\] indeed burnt up those \[50\]. They defeated those \[50\]. He
who knows this and offers the fire-sticks defeats his evil enemies.

This brāhmaṇa is notable for more than one thing: We know that the
Hindus were aware of the formula for the sum of natural numbers
![1..n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1..n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"1..n") from the famous citation of the sage Śākapūṇi in the Bṛhaddevatā
regarding the hidden Āgneya ṛk-s associated with the “jātavedase
sunavāma…” sūkta (Ṛgveda 1.99). There he gives the sum of
1+2+3…+1000=500500. This brāhmaṇa gives the derivation of the formula
for the sum of such a series cryptically and is reminiscent of how Carl
Gauss said he computed such a sum as kid. Both brāhmaṇa-s from the two
YV saṃhitā-s importantly play on the power of the word śata (100) in the
incantation. Once Manu gives his 5 dispossessed sons the samidh-s they
are said to have beaten their 50 rival half-brothers. How does this come
about? Again it seems to rely on an arithmetic symbolism. When he gave
them the samidh-s, as the TS states that samidh makes you śatendriya.
Thus, it seems to imply that the 5 become ![5\\times 100 \>
50](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=5%5Ctimes+100+%3E+50&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"5\\times 100 \> 50") thereby beating their half brothers.

That apart it also provides a clue regarding the origin of the story
formula of the Mahābharata. We have remarked several times before that
when old history was composed it was poured in the bottles of
preexisting myth and thereby took their shape. Thus, when we encounter
formulaic numbers like 100 (Kaurava-s) and 5 (Pāṇḍava-s) one is
immediately alerted to the use of a preexisting mythic frame. Indeed,
such a formula related to the count and the differentiation of the
Pāṇḍu-s extends beyond the Indo-Iranian horizon. In the Secret
History of the Chingizid Mongols we hear the tale of their legendary
ancestress Alan Qo’a bearing 5 sons. Notably, there too 2 of her sons
are of different father from the from other 3. A birth through a divine
non-human father is implied for 3 of them (all 5 in the case of the
Pāṇḍu-s). Further, Alan Qo’a specifically instructs her 5 sons to
be united despite their being half-brothers. So there is a hint of the
need of unity in face of conflict fraternal conflict. These motifs echo
what are seen far away in time and space in the Mahābhārata of the
Hindus. Hence, we were curious as to whether we might find earlier
echoes of the Mahābhārata story formula in earlier Indo-Āryan tradition.
We believe that the above brāhmaṇa is indeed the “essentialized” motif
of fraternal conflict featuring the number of 5 against 50 that became 5
versus ![50 \\times
2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=50+%5Ctimes+2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"50 \\times 2") in the Mahābhārata where the party of 5 prevailed in the
end despite being initially dispossessed as in this case.

Now we move on to an entirely different theme from a brāhmaṇa passage
from the Kapiṣṭhala-kaṭha-Saṃhita 35.8.

sā eṣā anuṣṭup । tasyāḥ saptākṣaram ekam pādam aṣṭākṣarāṇi trīṇi । teṣāṃ
saptānāṃ yāni trīṇi tāny aṣṭāv upayanti । tany ekādaśa । sā triṣṭup ।
yāni catvāri tāny aṣṭāv upayanti । tāni dvādaśa । sā jagatī । yāny
aṣṭau sā gāyatrī ।parā pāpmānaṃ bhātṛvyaṃ bhāvayati ya evaṃ vidvān
etāḥ samidha ādadhāti ।

There was this Anuṣṭubh. 1 of its feet had 7 syllables, the
\[remaining\] 3 had 8. Of the \[foot\] which had 7, 3 of them went to
the 8. That made 11. This was the Triṣṭubh. The \[remaining\] which were
4 \[of that foot\] went to the 8. That made 12. This was the Jagatī. The
\[remaining\] feet which had 8 \[syllables became\] the Gāyatrī
(Kapiṣṭala-kaṭha-saṃhitā 35.8).

The model being proposed here is something comparable to what we see in
evolution of nucleic acid and protein sequences. The original Anuṣṭubh
is conceived thus:  
![--------|--------](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=--------%7C--------&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"--------|--------")  
![--------|-------](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=--------%7C-------&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"--------|-------")

There is fission and fusion with deletion shown by \[\]:  
![--------|---\[----\] \\; \\rightarrow\\;
-----------](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=--------%7C---%5B----%5D+%5C%3B+%5Crightarrow%5C%3B+-----------&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"--------|---[----] \\; \\rightarrow\\; -----------") (1 foot of
Triṣṭubh) or  
![--------|\[---\]---- \\; \\rightarrow\\;
------------](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=--------%7C%5B---%5D----+%5C%3B+%5Crightarrow%5C%3B+------------&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"--------|[---]---- \\; \\rightarrow\\; ------------") (1 foot of
Jagatī)

What remains is:  
![--------|--------](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=--------%7C--------&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"--------|--------")  
![--------](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=--------&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"--------") (Gāyatrī)

Of course, no surviving regular Anuṣṭubh from the earliest Vedic
tradition has a 7-syllabled final foot. So is this merely a case of
brāhmaṇa numerology or does it reflect some early development in
prosody? Now the existence of a basic 8-syllabled unit is something
mentioned early in Vedic tradition e.g. by Kurusuti Kāṇva:

vācam aṣṭāpadīm ahaṃ navasraktim ṛtaspṛśam ।  
indrāt pari tanvam mame ॥ (RV8.076.12)

An eight-\[syllable\]-footed, nine-cornered utterance, touching Ṛta  
I have measured out its body from Indra.

Being a Gāyatrī with 3 feet of
![8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "8")
syllables each, the ṛk is testimony for what it states. Further, what is
the “nonagonal” form of the utterance? The sūkta in question is composed
as sets of tṛca-s of Gāyatrī-s. Thus each tṛca has ![3 \\times
3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3+%5Ctimes+3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"3 \\times 3") 8-syllabled feet giving us the navasrakti structure the
ṛṣi mentions. Thus, we can be sure that 8 was definitely a
recognized unit of the foot from early one. Further, the very term pāda
as a metrical foot has a Iranian cognate
pa![\\delta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\delta")a used in the same sense. Further, πούς (poús) as used by
Aristophanes suggests that this was indeed the originally the Greek
cognate of the Vedic pāda. Thus a comparable metric foot was recognized
early in Indo-European. By comparing Sanskrit, Avestan and Greek, Martin
West proposed that there are reconstructible proto-feet of Indo-European
prosody with 8 syllables and other versions of them with 6 and 7
syllables. If this were true then the brāhmaṇa might be recalling or
reconstructing an origin mechanism wherein the shortened 7-syllabled
element fragments and merges with adjacent 8-syllabled feet to give rise
to the Triṣṭubh and Jagatī.

In any case this irregular hypothetical Anuṣṭubh is not the standard
Anuṣṭubh of Sanskrit which since the earliest Vedic record came to be
of ![4 \\times
8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%5Ctimes+8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"4 \\times 8") syllables. Indeed, this form of the Anuṣṭubh was the
basis of a child’s mathematical problem presented by Bhāskara-II in his
Līlāvatīː

samānām ardha-tulyānām viṣamāṇām pṛthak pṛthak ।  
vṛttānām vada me saṃkhyām anuṣṭubh-chandasi drutam ॥

Tell me quickly what are the counts of the variations of Anuṣṭubh meter
with:  
(i) same \[configuration of feet\]  
(ii) half-equivalent \[feet\]  
(iii) dissimilar \[feet\]

Each syllable can take a short (0) or a long state (1) . If every foot
has the same configuration of 0,1 then we only have to look for
combinations of one 8-footed element. If it has half-equivalent feet the
two ![2 \\times
8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2+%5Ctimes+8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2 \\times 8") syllable configurations are the same. But we have remove
all instances where all 4 feet are same for a strict definition. Now if
all feet are dissimilar then we have 32 syllables available but we have
to remove all those where either all or a pair of feet are the same.
Thus we get the answers as:  
(i)
![2^8=256](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E8%3D256&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^8=256")  
(ii) ![2^{16}-2^8=
65536-256=65280](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B16%7D-2%5E8%3D+65536-256%3D65280&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^{16}-2^8= 65536-256=65280")  
(iii)
![2^{32}-2^{16}=4294967296-65536=4294901760](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D-2%5E%7B16%7D%3D4294967296-65536%3D4294901760&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"2^{32}-2^{16}=4294967296-65536=4294901760")

Interestingly, these numbers make an appearance in modern computing e.g.
as in 16-bit and 32 bit computing and the largest 32 bit number.
