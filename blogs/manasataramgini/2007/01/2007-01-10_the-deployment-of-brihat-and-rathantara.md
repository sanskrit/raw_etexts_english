title = "The deployment of bR^ihat and rathantara"

+++
The ancient bhArgava ushanA kAvya has declared how the bR^ihat and
rathantara are to be deployed for attacking the bhrAtR^ivya-s. When
dispatched the two sAmans assumes the form of a chakra of brahman and
proceed to slay the foe even as the deva-s had imbued a chakra with the
force of indra’s vajra to overthrow the dAnavas. At the same time it
protects the yajamAna.  
The ritualist first sings the rathantara and makes a soma offering to
indra who is glorified by the sAman. Then he utters the formula ” namo
mAtre pR^ithivyai rathantara mA mA hiMsIH ||”  
Then he sings the bR^ihat and offers soma and utters the mantra: ” divaM
pitaraM upashraye bR^ihan mA mA hiMsIH ||”  
Then he recites both and utters the deadly formula: “prANair amuShya
prANAn vR^i\~NkShva |  
takShena takShaNIyasAyur asya prANAn vR^i\~NkShva | kruddha enaM manunyA
daNDena jahi | dhanur enaM AtatyeShvA vidhya ||”  
With that the brahman of the sAmans issues forth as a deadly astra in
pursuit of the foe. The jaiminIya declares “bR^ihad-rathantarayor
evainaM mukhe .apidadhAti | yaM dveShTi taM purA saMvatsarAt prANo
jahAti |”
