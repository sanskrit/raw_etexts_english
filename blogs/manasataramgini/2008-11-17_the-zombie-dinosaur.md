was extraordinarily excited about a toy dinosaur, perhaps even more so
than his kids :-). R was much less impressed and felt it was not worth
the pelf and complained about anatomy of the limbs, the skin, the tongue
and the battery. Marc and R have always been connoisseurs of peculiar
toys, under excuse of educating their descendents, and have been my
window into such things. They were sometime back excited about some game
called Spore in which they were making a really extraordinary
cyber-menagerie – only sadly it did not install my aging system. Then
they were telling of the interesting-sounding pleasure island they
discovered in navyarkapura – a shop called Evolution. Now it was this
toy dinosaur called Pleo. I have seen a few dinosaur robots before and
they were awfully disgusting; the tautology is required. But this beast
was supposedly different – it is a full-fledged robotic dinosaur with a
reasonable behavioral range –an agent perhaps not yet autonomous. To see
what all this excitement was about I did some scouting, heard a talk by
its inventor Caleb Chung, and saw a few videos. I was pretty impressed –
the world of zombies seems even closer on us than I thought. Most
importantly its behavior appears to be “open-source” so it leaves the
door open for fairly complex memetic evolution.
