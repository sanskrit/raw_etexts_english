The Mogol tyrant Akbar gave the old tradition stemming from the mankha
and yamoghaNTha-s of yore an unexpected revival when it had nearly died
under the depredations of the rAkShasa-mata. In the later phase of his
career post 1579 CE the once ardent Ghazi started losing his faith in
the cult of marUnmatta and started turning to a more Hindu way of
thought. He commissioned illustrated versions of various Hindu texts
since he had a problem with reading and writing. One such is the famous
rAmAyaNa (The Freer rAmAyaNa, now preserved in the Smithsonian
collection). While painted by both Hindu and Mohammedan artists, it
shows a marked Abrahamistic influence throughout â€“ notice the lack of
the yaj\~nopavIta-s for kShatriya-s and brAhmaNa-s and the horned
demons. Several key figures are painted in the image of Akbar himself.
