## CLXXXIII

*To Miss Mary Hale*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,  
*11th July, 1900*.

MY DEAR DEVOTED SISTER,

I was glad to get your note as also to learn that you were going to
Greenacre. Hope you will have much profit. I have been much censured by
everyone for cutting off my long hair. I am sorry. You forced me to do
it.

I had been to Detroit and came back yesterday. Trying as soon as
possible to go to France, thence to India. Very little news here; the
work is closed. I am taking regularly my meals and sleeping — that is
all.

Ever faithful and loving brother,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. Write to the girls to send my mails, if any, at Chicago.

V.
