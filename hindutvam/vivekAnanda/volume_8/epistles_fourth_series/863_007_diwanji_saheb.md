ELLAPA BALARAM'S HOUSE,  
C/O. THAKORE OF LIMDI,  
NEUTRAL LINE, POONA,  
*15th June, 1892*.

DEAR DIWANJI SAHEB, (Shri Haridas Viharidas Desai)

It is a long time since I heard from you. I hope I have not offended you
anyway. I came down with the Thakore Saheb of Mahabaleshwar, and I am
living here with him. I would remain here a week or more and then
proceed to Rameshwaram via Hyderabad.

Perhaps by this time every hitch has been removed from your way in
Junagad; at least I hope so. I am very anxious to learn about your
health, especially that sprain, you know.

I saw your friend the Surti tutor to the Prince of Bhavnagar. He is a
perfect gentleman. It was quite a privilege to make his acquaintance; he
is so good and noble-natured a man.

My sincerest greetings to your noble-minded brothers and to our friends
there. Kindly send to Mr. Nabhubhai my earnest good wishes in your
letter home. I hope you would gratify me by a speedy reply.

With my sincerest respects and gratitude and prayers for you and yours,
I remain,

Yours faithfully,  
VIVEKANANDA.
