+++
The Geser Khan Epic of the Turko-Mongols is one of the last frontiers of
comparative mythology that remains unexplored in terms of its potential
to provide insights into the archaic structure of Eurasian mythology. It
is the only surviving Eurasian epic that in its size and scope compares
with the mahAbhArata of the Indo-Aryans.

The epic\* beings with the lines:  
  
*When Khan Hormazda Tengri was a swaddled child, *  
*In the very beginning, when the thousand white gods*  
*were being rocked in the warmth of their cradles,*  
*Ten thousand white tenger were raised by Mother Ekhe Yuuren Ibii.  
When fifty-five tengri were born from the Milky Way,*  
*When many rich tenger began in the evening time,*  
*A thousand gods and protector spirits and ten thousand tenger were
supported by*  
*Grandmother Manzan Gurme Toodei with her silver cup.*  
  
The point of interest to be noted here is the principal protagonist of
the epic is the great deity Hormazada. He is clearly a derivative of the
Iranian deity Ahura Mazda, the cognate of the Indo-Aryan varuNa (asura
medhira). This suggests that development of the main epic structure
occured after the first contact of the Altaic tribes of Central Asia
with the Iranian branch of Indo-Europeans. While there is definitely
older purely, Altaic and Eurasiatic material in the Epic there its
development in current form did have the Iranian influences. Linguistic
evidence strongly suggests that the early Altaic words for pastoralism
are of Indo-Iranian origin, suggesting that these cultural infusions may
have had a common source. The Iranians of the proto-Kushana and Shaka
lineages were amongst the earliest to interact with the archaic Huns
during the meteoric rise of the first Hun Khaâ€™Khan of all Mongolia,
Motun Tegin. The history of Motun Tegin documents the role of the
Iranian tribes in introducing the Mongols to effective horse-borne
pastoralism. This was soon followed by the crushing defeat of the Shakas
and the Kushans on the steppes and their eventual eviction by the
archaic Huns.

While the possibility of even earlier interaction between the Altaic
tribes and the Indo-Aryans is suggested by the transfer of the Altaic
goddess Umai to the Indo-Aryans (as umA, the wife of rudra, earlier
known as ambikA and pR^ishNi), the exact contributions of this
interaction cannot be confidently assessed.
