Some mentalities like the one mentioned in [this section(page 71 of the
PDF
document)](http://estudantedavedanta.net/laghu-yoga-vasishta-english-translation.pdf#page=71)
of the Laghu Yoga Vasiṣṭha set in stably only when the vāsanās
favourable to generating that state of mind set in. They can be
generated in various ways,like:

-   This meditation on [various parts of the body(pages 44 to 50 of the
    document)](http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/know-see.pdf#page=44)(after
    completing the preliminaries to do that sort of meditation) in the
    Nāstika Theravāda tradition
-   Bhagavad Nāmasmaraṇa(after leading a life with moderation and
    control in senses)(uninterrupted rememberance/repitition of the
    names of various deities like Viṣṇu,Kṛṣṇa,Śiva,etc). In this
    light,the advice of Rūpa Gosvāmīn in the Upadeśāmṛta is
    helpful(quoting from Prabhupada’s translation)



vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ

jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam

etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ

sarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt

A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind’s demands,
the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is
qualified to make disciples all over the world.

atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca  
prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ  
jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca  
ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati

One’s devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the
following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting
more funds than required; (2) overendeavoring for mundane things that
are very difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane
subject matters; (4) Practicing the scriptural rules and regulations
only for the sake of following them and not for the sake of spiritual
advancement, or rejecting the rules and regulations of the scriptures
and working independently or whimsically; (5) associating with
worldly-minded persons who are not interested indevotionalism; and (6)
being greedy for mundane achievements.

utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt

tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt

saṅga-tyāgāt sato vṛtteḥ

ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati

There are six principles favorable to the execution of pure devotional
service: (1) being enthusiastic, (2) endeavoring with confidence, (3)
being patient, (4) acting according to regulative principles \[such
as[śravaṇaṁ](https://sanskritdictionary.org/sravanam)[kīrtanaṁ](https://sanskritdictionary.org/kirtanam)viṣṇoḥ[smaraṇam](https://sanskritdictionary.org/smaranam)**\[**SB7.5.23\]—hearing,
chanting and
remembering[Kṛṣṇa](https://sanskritdictionary.org/krsna)\], (5)
abandoning the association of nondevotees, and (6) following in the
footsteps of the previous ācāryas. These six principles undoubtedly
assure the complete success of pure devotional service.

Of course in the course of practicing devotional service as mentioned
above,that vāsanā automatically sets in as a consequence of the bhava
towards the deity.

So,insights like these are of a ‘yogic’ class,and do not remain
stable/hardly arise in one who is not inclined to any form of
yoga(hence,the reason you don’t find many anatomy students/professors
becoming renunciants),and have to be cultivated and strengthened as we
practice yoga.
