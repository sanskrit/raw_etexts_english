EP1GRAPHIA INDICA YOLUME XYIII   
No, L-KONDANAGUBU GRMT OP IKDBAVAEMAK. 
By PEOFESSOB B. HULTZSCH, PH.D.;HALLE (SAALE). 
Ink impressionsof this inscription were sent to me by Eao Bahadur EL Krishna Sastri, &long with the following descriptionof the original plates: 
"This set of five copper-plates was received from Pendyala Subrahmanya Sastri, National College, Masnlipatam, through the President,District Board, Godavari, in June 1921. Theplates are held together bya circular ring- rivetted into the hack of a circular aeal, on the countersunk surface of which are cut, in relief, a crescent, the word sri-TyigadliETi, and an expandinglotus-flower of sixpetals, The plates bear writingon eightfaces in all, the first send last plates having writing only on their inner sides, and have no raised rims. Theymeasure about 1" in breadth, and a little less than 2'' in height The ring-holeis bored at a distance of about \" from the left margin of the plates and measures about f in diameter. The ring has a diameter of about 4", and the seal is a little more than 2" in diameter. The plutes, witk the ring and seal, weigh 100 tolas. The ring was cut in this office,"1 
The writing on the platesis on the whole in a state of very good preservation. Thealphabet resembles that of other early Eastern Chalukya inscriptions* The secondary forms of i and I are not always clearly distinguished. The JihviimuMya occurs in j/aR* kaichid* (1. 30). A final form of m is frequently used;one of t is found in prftdat (1, 18) and vaset (1. 34), one of ft in raja[r*]$fc?n (L 26), and one of I in -Sol (four times in 1. 28 1, and once in 1. 37), 
The language of the inscriptionis Sanskrit prose ;but three verses of VSdarVyssa are quotedin lines 31-35. The Telugu plural -Bdl occurs four times in line 28 f.,and once, in line 37. Lingual jfis used also in Ohalnlcy^nSm (L 6), -ytt$roa& (1. 16), and in the Telugu village name VelleTcU (L 29), The Telugur occurs in the two village-names Oherupuru (1. 20) andlrrato[r] (L 22). The vowel n after consonants is generally expressed bythe syllable n. After r consonants (except sibilants) are doubled, and dh is doubled before yin maddhyS (1, 21)* In -vahha-tfhalasya (L9 f.) s is elided before stL In line 28 the group jis employed instead of jft in vififapanaya and afijapti (for ftjfiapti). In line 21 the adjective nw[5*jrin seems to be used in the sens$ of'lying, situated.1 
The inscription records the grantof the villageof Konda^agBru to the BrShmanaOhendigarman by the Maharaja Indravarman, sumamed sri-Tysgadh6im,si.e.'the(celestial) cow in liberality,' who was a son of the Maharaja Visknttvardhaaa $nd a grandson of the Maharaja KIrtivatman, and who belongedto the familyof the CMJukyafl, The donor's father, Vishnuvardhana, has to be identified with VishnTivardhana I, the founder of the 
[The inscription has been reviewed in the JSpigrwphicd Reportfor 1922 j App. A, No. 2, and p. 96, Ed,] Tlie &ime surname forms the legend OB the seal of ibis giant which is reproduced on the back o! FUte of thfl I, infra.
1P1GEAPHIA IND10A. [Tor. XVIII.  
Chalukya dynasty^ who is known to haV "been the younger son of the Western Chatakya Kng Eirtiyarm.au I. Cop&eqtiently, Indravarpaan must be the actual name of the younger eon of Vishnn-vardhana I, who Is called Indra-Bliattaraka or Indraraja In the inscrip 
of Mi successors, and who, according to later' tradition, reigned only for seven days.1 The grant seems to have been jnade at the requestof a chief named Kondivarman, and the executor of the gr^nt seems to have been Indravarman's eldest son, who likewise bore the name Indravarmam. From other inscriptions we know only of a single son of Indra-Bhat$araka &T IndrarSja, who succeeded to the tJirQ&e ajs Yish^uvardhana II. 
Line 28 i. contains four signatures o'f witnesses of the grant, each of which consists of the name of some village, followed, by the word Sol. In the opinion of Rao Bahadur Krishna Sastri, &5l (for Bdyaht) is the Telngu pluralof Soya. In the Ghendalftr plates of A.D. 673, Bdya occurs five times, and is once replaced by the Sanskrit word v&stuvya,*a resident, inha bitant.'2 The sarpB must be the meaning of the word Bdya in a grant of Vishrxuvardhana II, where a large number of donees are mentioned by name and are stated to have been Soyas, t.e. *residents,'of certain villages.* In the Cfeendalui* plates of AD, 6-73- the actual names of' the $qnees are omxtte4 andihe expression'resident of such and such. a village'is employed in the place of the donee*s proper name.

The MaMraja Iiubavarman, whose other name was Tyagadhenu (1. 16 1), adorned tlie family of the Oha^nkyaB (1. 6 1) ;was a grandson of he Maharaja Klrtivarmnn (L 7 f.) ; ami iros a son of the Maharaja VislinTivardliana^ (11. 8-10). He granted the village11 of Kondana gttra (1. 18) to ChendlSarman (L 25), son of Vishnusarman of the Bharadvaja gotra (I 23 f.) and grsadsoH of Burgasarman, (also) called lpralHCr]-Boya5 of the Vajasangya cliarana {1X21-23). The Txmndaries of the Tillage, granted were: in the North, Hujumailru ; in tho Xaat^ ^gtmaru ; in the South, Clxerupiiru ; and in the West, Irbba[l]i (11. 18-21), 
The grant seems to have been made at the instance of a chief named KondivarmPDu whoed to the family of Aryyahii(?) and at whose request the Maharaja's (t?t& IndravarmaiiV) son, who, (like his father), "bore the name Indravarman, was appointed executor (jwtpti) f iMs (grant).^ Line 28 1 seems to contain the names of four witnesses of the grant, preceded

No. 2. BAHUB PLATES OF NRIPATTTWGAVAKMAN. 
BY PROFESSOR B. HULTZSCH, PnJX; HALLE (SAALE). 
As stated by M. Julien Vinson, this inscriptionis engraved on five copper-plates whicla were discovered by M. Jules Delafon2 in 1879*at a depth of about one metre, in the middle of a structure of bricks, at six metres south of the pagoda of Batinr, an important locality on the south of Pondichenyj from which it is* 28* 5 kilometres distant.' The plates are now preserved in the Biblioth&qne Nationale, Paris. They measure about 91*5 millimetres in height, 2o]'9 mm.
in. breadth, and 4t"l mm. in thickness, and weigh altogether 3106 grammes.There is the usual ring-tiole, 13*5 mm. in diameter, at a distance of 9-10 mm. from the left margin of each plate; but the ring which must have been originally passed through the holes and borne the royal seal, has not been recovered.*It had surely been broken long ago ;for the first side of the third plate and the second side of the second one are in worse condition than the other sides. They were no doubt on the outside of the set. This allows us to conclude that the document has been buried with carelessness or in impatienthate.' I am deriving all %ese details from M. Vinson's article* Le college de Bahour au IXesiecle,'3 in wHich he fumis^ed a tentative transcript and translation of the inscription. Tears ago I had published a few remarks on it,4 based on a transcript which had been prepared by a Tamil pandit and suppliedto me by M. Delafon, Thin transcript has "been recently printedin full, with some additional remarks, by Rao Bahadur Krishna Sa&tri.5 The historical importance of the record now induces me to re-edit it from a set of photographs which M. Vinson had been good enough to send me in 1 91) 5, The photo graphs are not quite perfect and distinct, but nearly everydetail of the text can be made out from them with certainty. 
The languages of the inscription are Sanskrit and Tamil, and the alphabets are Grantha and Tamil, respectively. There are 32 Sanskrit verses (11. 1-45 and 74-7?) ;the rest of the text is in Tamil prose (11. 45-74 and 78 f.). Grantha letters are occasionally used also in the Tamil portion (Nri, 1. 45; rmma, 1. 46; brahmadeya, L 50; uidya&tha,11. 51,71; vidyabhoga, 11. 52, 71 1 ; ha, and vy avaste($fh,ai) 9 1. 72; sarvvapariha, brahma. and datti, L 73; Uditodaya and <i, 1. 78; Nripatumga,1. 79), and the Tamil syllable raA occurs in a Sanskrit verse (1. 34), while the purely Tamil name Nilaitangiis written in Grantha letters (Nilait&&g*3ti, L 30). In the Sanskrit portion, the secondary form of I is not distinguished from that of i, nor that of ri from that of m, nor p from v. In the Tamil portion, the lengthof initial e and & is not marked in Sri (L 72) and ddai (L 69). The secondary forms of f, e, o are the same as those of i, e, o. The length of the vowel t is marked in 'ur, Vagur^JTrattur,Ortw% #Sr, and jpwrfi; but the mu of immunrurum (I, 50) does not differ in shape from mw, and from the lu of ~palun~ (I 68). 
1 The names of the 64 shareholders are not specified, but the latter are alluded to by the pronoun ete,*these,* implies that they were assembled in the king's presence when he made the grant. For similar instances of tl nse of the pronounetad see above, Vol. IX, p. 59, note 6. The unnamed donees perhaps consisted of the chief donee Chendisaraan and his relatives, and of the four persons who were mentioned as witnesses of th grant in line 28 f. 
2 To the same gentleman we owe the discovery of the Kasakugi plates of Nandivarman (S, L L, YoL 113 No. 73).

All these defect^ "spellsare well kn^fiom, many other T*mii w^riptiw.? They were not intended to ipplyactual differences of- pronunciation, but we oafc due to t' imperfect developmentof the old Tamil alphabet. In my transcript, 5. hs-ve, Aewfojie,   
stifrated the long Ypwefe wherevW they- are required.In. the Sanscrit portion, a -fiatf of m is frequently employed (11. 11, 12, 13, etc.). Virama is expressed by*i<l dash after n (11. 10, 29 (?), 35 (?), 40, 41), but seems to be omitted generallyafter final t (11. 4, o, ^b, W,30 45) 'where I have tacitly suppliedit. Superscribedr has the same shapeas Virama, bat is represented bya pointin mrfrbJiau, (L 16); and -jpflrwafafcM (* 32).. In the Tamil portion, VirSma is expressed onlyin. two instances.: bya vertical. dash in tan ,(1. .48), and by a point (8tt#0 in n (L 50). In the Sanskrit portion,the. end of averse is marked indiscriminately by various signs of punctuation, consistingof one or more of five different elements (|, \\, .:, ,, 0), but which i; have in everycase replaced by the usual mark (||). The end of the first half of a verse is marked by a horizontal line (~) onlyin. five,instances (11. 33, 15, .17, 20, 30). At the end of the two Tamil passages, two other signs of punctuationare employed,wia. :||0 (1. J74) and :ln (1. 79). 
The orthography;of the Sanskrit portioncalls for a few. remarks. Tamil pronunciation is responsible for the forms. Tantivarmman (11- 14,1 8) for D^niwarr^n^an, and rebha (J. 33) for repAa, and agatha(l, 37^is. meant for agadfeo. The group ksh is. replaced by tth in rctratsha (1. 9 f.), tshmapalo,-^'. 14 f.)< -difyitthayS, Q. 17)-, and Latshmir~ (I. 20). The Santlhi. rules are disregarded in pSlav&t^bh&miib (1, 15), Jcritavan^sastra" (1. 4&), svarggo,m^vimanetna (1, 13), and labdham=vidya- (1. 35). Visarga is dropped, not only, as 'optionally permitted,in <*tSju tthiti- (I. 3) and d&sa.sthanasya (1. 44), but also in va sriyam- (1. 1) and rSjii-a sri (11,, 21, 42). Consonants .are doubled after r, with four, exceptions (Sri-l>ha,rtus=,1. 3,. wirfMbhatt, 1. 1C,, and Dfc8[r*]./ai'r*;'a$a ,1. 36,).2 Double t is. simplified before in, datv& (1. 39) and tatva (I. 45). The Tamil of the grant portionis on the whole correct. The only mistak.es. in it are (1.49) for pakkatii>wmf natti andm$w,ifra (1. 53) for natii. and wjfwMca, vifainda (1. 66) for. fimam (1, 67) for &rumt vypvastet/um (I. 72 f.) for vywasthaiyumi and a few other alipa in two last lines of the inscription, The genitive .affix in is joined. to ellai,'a boundaay,' without Soadhi in ellatin (11. 58, 63, 64 f., 65, 66), and its final is doubled before the conjunctive affix vm in eZkMgjjMm (11. 58, 59, 60? 61). Similarly, the pastrelative participle dyi$ais spelt 3fina (L 62). For the past gerund Sy we have ayi (1. 7'2, and twice in 1. 73), which is an archaic form; meyi (1. 68) for mey, 'to graze \ av.&Nelvayipfa'klca'm (L 59 f.) for NekSygpdlcJcam. 
The metres of the Sanskrit portion are : Drutavilambita (verses 1, 7), Vafiimtatilakft (15, 31), Arya (32), and Anushtubh .(3-6, '8-14, 16-30). Th.e metre of Teree 2 is Praharahinl ; but its fourth Pada is Anushtubh, and in each of the two first Padas the tenth and, eleveth' syllables of the Praharshiol metpre are missing. I, am unable to correct and translate this vers* in a satisfactory manner. 
The Tamil portion of the'inscription records a grant of three villages, and the Sanskrit, portion precedingit professesto be a eulogy (yraiasti,1. 45) celebrating the donor. Th'o Tamil and the Sanskrit versions supplement and corroborate each other, and have both to be considered together. The grant was made,jux the eighth year (11.46, 51) of the reign, of king (to) Tijaya-Hjipatuagavarinan (L 45 f.), or simply Nyipattifcgavarmen (1. 74 f.), ITripatiinga (11,24, 25, 32), or Tngavarman-(1..42>,v who boasted of the- title 'lord of -the three world*'' OL 22 1, 41 i), Verses 2-16.con.tein the following genealogical account of this king; IVom the lotos-flower arising from Vishnu's navel was produced Brahma ; from him, Angiras 5 from him, Bnhaspatijfromfern,.

king of several inscriptionsof tlie Pallava kings of Ksflchi. Next we are told tHat from family of Pallavacarose a group (of kings) commencing witK Viaiala and KbfLk&nlka'(verse 7), and that,*after Vimala, etc., had gone to heaven'(verse 8), there was DarftivaimarL (vei*se 9), whose son was ITandivarman (verse 12). As I have suggested drt a forrtier occasion,1 tie *group (of kings) commencing with Yimala and Kon&ani&a'?which is gaxcdwiched between the mythical kiiig Pallava and thfe historical kiitg Danti^arman, probably owes its niention to* the desire of claiming fot the tetter connection with the WeStern GAagi Sings, whose ancestor is believed to have been Koiikani.2 Tlte queen of Nandivartritoj S&okiia; by time; was borit in the B&s&trakGta family (verse 13) and bore to him the donor of this* graiiV ifripgtiliiigsL (verse 15). Of him verse 16 t&Hs ris that he supplied a 3?andy& king,wto'se pi-opdr naine itf n6t disclosed, with an army, and that he defeated softie enemies, wHo are not specified eitlie'r, on th8 further b&nk t> the ArieMit river. The name of this river must be a Sansferitized form of Arisil, a branch of the' EavM whidb enters the sea at Kgraikkal (Kafitaf).13 -" it ittxf be

According to the Tamil portion, tEe grant was made at the requestof Vesali-pSraraiyan (1. 46), i.e.* the greatchief of Vesali.' The Sanskrit portion supplieshis proper nam6, Mr tanda (L 27 f.)> and his surname, Hilaitangi6(1. 30), and c$lls him, with a* play on his name Martanda, the sun of the Vesali family* (1. 27 f.). From other inscriptions we leam that Vesa* lippadi was the name of a province,of which Vagtir-niMjxLj i.e. the country round Bahur, formed a subdivision.7 Evidently Marfenda was a' heredilkry chief of this province. HeClaimed descent from' thfc family of Kum (11. 279 31 f., 43), the mytMMT s&cGSb&r of the heroes 
f the Mahabharata. At his own request (1L 32, 46 f!.)',lie' hM deceived three villages in his wn province (rashtra) from king ISTripatunga (verse 21). This probably means nothing "but that his sovereign accorded him permission to give away these three villages, and explains two 
apparently conflicting statements, viz. that, in verses 23> 269 and 29, Martanda is represented as tie actual donor, while, in verse 3 1, K"iipatugavarmaBclaims the merit of having made the grant himself. 
The executor (ajftapti in Sanskrit, 1L 32, 39, and 41, or ahatti in Tamil, 1. 47) of the grant was TTttamagila (1. 41), the minister (mantrin) of king TungaYarman (1. 42), i.e. of Nripa- , t*mga. He had the title Videlvidugii-BIadnpatti-Tamila-peraraiysn (1. 47), i.e.*the great 
ehief of the Tamilians ,of Videlvidugu-Kadupatti,' As K&dupattiis a synonym of Pallava,8 Uttamasila's title suggeststhat Videlvi^gn^ i>& *the crashing thunderbolt,' was a surname of the Pallava king Nripatunga, The sana$ word Tidelvid)igu seems to have been a surname of his iatlier Nandivarman. For an inscription of kiiig Vijaya-lSfandivikram.aTar.man and of Msfeudatory, the Bana chief Vikramadit^at Timvallam9 records the grant of a village namedTidelvidugu-Vikkii^maditta-chatui^ediinapgal^in. The first member of this compound wcml

must refer to Nripatanga'sfather Nandivarmaa,1 and the second one to the Bana chief Vxkra maditya. The executor (atiatti) of the Tirnvallam grant wasKa4upatti-Tamiia-pera[rai]ya which may be taken as a title either of UttamaIla himself, or of another minister who preceded him in office daring the reign of Nandivarman. 
The recipients of the grant were the residents of a'seat of learning'(vidyS-stli&na) or college, at VSgfir (11. 51 f., 71j see also 11. 35, 37 f., 38 f., and 44 of the Sanskritportion), i.e BaMr, where the plates were discovered by M. Delafon. As M. Vinson remarks,* the modern form looks like a learned corruption, deriving the ancient name VSgnr from the Sanskrit Ishu ' an arm,' instead of the Tamil vagu, beauiy.' The grant was to be a vidyMdga (11, 52 71 f )' i.e. a scarce of revenue for the promotion oflearning. This is perhaps the earliest case on record of a university scholarship or educational endowment. 
As in the Leyden plates (a scholarly transcript, translation, and analysis of which still remain a desideratum),the official routine observed in this grant was as follows The three Tillages having been granted to the Vagttr college, an order (tirwugam, 1. 54) communicating this fact and callmg for a report (arai^l^, 11. 53, 55, 56) was issued to the headmen of Kilveli IT"?64U' (^fuMi7ioJ1 of the district) of Arava-aa-du' (1. 48). Having read the order, the headmen of the #, reverently placedit on their heads and circumambulated the limits of the> villages granted. .Lane 40 of the Sanskrit portion suggests that, as in the case of the Leyden pkte hey were accompanied by an elephant whose hoofprints marked the boundaries on wluch^ra^dstonesandplantedmilk.bush(11.53, 55).

M. Vinson1 lias consulted a local map and tells us that, besides Vaguu (Bahnr), two of tliese village-names survive to'tlae present day: KiriiMnpattiis now represented 'by Kirimaoa bskkam, 6 kilometres north-east of Bahnr, and Yilangattangaduvannrts perhapsconnected with Kactuvanur, 5 kilometres west of Bahfir. I hope nay Brahinin irknds in Madras will find &n opportunityfor making enquiries on the spot, and will succeed in identifying a few more of the village-names which are registeredin the detailed descriptionof the boundaries of the   
grant. 
In verse 30 we are told that the Sanskrit \y*r&&a,sti, which forms the first portionof ihe inscription, was composed by Kagaya, a servant of the Vagftr college. At the end of the whole document, its writer informs us of his name and parentagein a Sanskrit verse (32) and in Tamil prose , (1. 78 1). He was a goldsmith (suvarnakrit or, in Tamil, tatian), named Mfipa tunga (11. 77, 79),"::-evidentlyafter his sovereign, a hereditary servant of the Pallava family, the son of Madevi-perundattaii, and the grandsonof Uditodaya-perund^ttan of EJ!- Paisaram toear Kacbchipedu (Conjeeveram). The name, or rather the title, of his father means 'the great goldsmith (by appointment)to the chief queen.' Similarly, the name of his grandfather would mean* the grea^ goldsmith (by appointment)to (king) Uditfldaya,' and Uditsdaya (L 78) or TJditSdita (1. 76) may have been a surname of one of the immediate predecessorsof king NripatungavariEan,TJditodita is actually known to have teen one of the fctLmerous birudas of Eajasimba, an earlier Pallava king of Kanchl.2 From this kingit be supposedto have descended to one of the predecessorsof Nripatungavaraian.

(Vishnu's) navel arose a lotus-flower, the germ of all. From this (flower) the self-horn (Brahma) was produced* 
(Verse 3.) From this four-mouthed lord of the world, Angiras was horn, (and) from the latter, Brihaspati, the minister of Sakra (Itidra), the splitter of .(the demon) Vala. (Verse 4.) Fiom him was born Samyu; from him, he who was named Bharadv&ja ;frotta him, the great archer Drona, whose valour equalled that of Sakra in battle. (Verse 5.) From this Ditma was produced, it is said, by a portionof Pinakixt (Siva) the long-armed Asvatthaman, who was skilled in all fights. 
(Verse 6.) From this Asvatthaman was bom a king named Pallava, who ruled the kiiigs , residing in the nine continents, together with the ploughmen. 
(Verse 7.) From his family arose a group (of kings) commencing with Vimala and Koiikanika, which was bowed to by the wives of enemies; which imposed commands even on other rulers of men; which was much beloved ; (and) which continually shouted 'victory*' 
(Verse 8 f.) Then, after Vimala, etc., having enjoyed by their own valour the earth girt by the four oceans, had gone to heaven on aerial cars, there was the long-armed (king) Dantiv&rni&t>, who resembled Purandara (Indra), showed firm devotion to Mura's foe (Vishnu), (and) was bowed to by the diadems of the rulers of the earth. 
(Verse 10.) By rulingthe earth according toir ght even in the Kali age, and by showering gifts, (this) ruler of men shone like a rsia-cloud. 
(Verse 11.) He dispatched arrows, furnishing (them) with provisionsfor (their)visit of thfc nether world under the guise of (the blood of those of his) enemies who were not (already) con fined* in his own prisons.1 
(Verse 12.) From Dsntivarm&o. was born that long-armed NandiTarmaa who subdued the earth unaided in battle. 
(Verse 13.) Just as Lakshml (is the consort)of Mura's foe (Vishnu), (the wife) of Nsndivarmfcn was the slender queen named Sank ha, who was bom in the B5gfrr&kuar 
family. 
(Verse 14.) Full of patiencelike the earth, beloved by ttae people like a mother, the queea named Sankha shone as if she were the embodied fortune of the king. 
(Verse 15*) By her who possessed intelligence, beauty, arts, etc., was born the virtuous Nripatungadeva* the lord of the three worlds, noble by birth* resembling the rising sun in splendour, (and) victorious in fights with arrows. 
(Verse 16.) Resembling fire, this king, by whose favour the Pan4ya tad obtained am army formerly, burnt a confederation of enemies in a battle on the further bank of the AricMt 
(river). 
(Verse 17.) Even in his youth (this) lord of the world (was) renowned (by the name) of INTyipatunga (i.e. 'the high one among rulers of men'), (He was) renowned not only on earth, (but) even in the other (world), like Rama* 
(Verse 18.) Provided by this king with benefits (was) Mart&nda of the family oi Vesali,* a descendant of the familyof Kuru, (and) intent on (affording) refuge to (his) subjects. (Verse 19.) A& ornament to the world like the moon, (and) resembling the ocean in. pro fundity, etc., (this) ruler of men (became) the resort of the people by protecting the peoples as if (he were) the sun.

(This casket was bronght to my notice in the year 1917, when I was Superintendent of tlie Archaeological Survey,Frontier Circle, Peshawar, by Khan Sahib Mian WasI U<UImt myAssistant. On inquiry 1 learnt that its exact find-spot was unknown, but tlmt it WK given as a present by a villager to one of the sons of the Nawab of Landi Yarghazo, while he wa Tahsildar of Eurratn. The casket is now in the possessionof his younger brother, a Htnduiit of the Edwardes College, Peshawar, froni whom I tried to acquireit for the local Muslim,of which I was the ex-officio Curator; but I could not succeed until the moment of mydeparture from JPeshawar in January, 1919. 
The casket is made of copper and measures 18" in height. Ite bae i square und ii attached to the drum by means of a fillet and grove joint. The hafmikS in of the ooiivoritonal shape ard loosely threaded on to a central shaft, also of copper, 
The casket is almost perfect in every detail and has the appearance of * mluiaturo $tup* with its harmixti and umbrellas. (PL I, a.) 
The relics which the dasket was meant to enshrine are no longer traceable. Likewise, a* 1 have observed already, the exact find-spot of the casket is unknown, Neither could I, owintf to the unsettled state of the Kurram valley, visit the spot and obtain toy local information. 
The inscriptiou on the casket consists of four lines of Khar58hthT Mript punctured in^heoase of the Kanishka casket from Shah-jVkl-dherl, on the four sklen of i te Hquiuv The writingcovers a space of 4fx2" on each side and seems to fee m fairly good pn toi, exceptas regards the lowermost line on two of the sides, which, unforiuniLlv disappeared altogether.

from the Malia-pariiairvft^a-Cliaitya of the Buddha, it is easyto see how much importance tho Buddhists attached to the same, It is for this reason that I remarked above thai the monument in which the presentcasket was enshrined must have been coxumiwcd in olden daysas one of the chief placesof worship. 
Let us now see if the places and persons mentioned in the inscription afford any duoto the identity of the monument. The only names available for this purpose an* (1) Tannm/a* ia-putrasa,i.e. the son of VarmayaSas, (2) Enubhtimi-rana, i.e. the king of RuubhUmi, and (3) Ucliarsaaa, which I take to be the name of an individual. - Who thin VarmayaiiaH wan and where he reigned as, undoubtedly, he seems to have been a king1 have not k^n able to ascertain from the materials at my command. On the other hand, Ucharfiana or tlttaranrna, if supposingI am rightin my equation, though not a historical personage, yot HOOWIH omwhatcapable of identification. In the itineraryof the Buddhist pilgrim Hinen Thnang it in naid : "About sixty H south-west from Mangkil city and on the east side of a great river wan the topeerected by Uttarasena, king of this -country,to enclose his share of th n.liH of tho Bu,ddhafs body, and near this was the tope which that king built to mark the wpot at which lu large white elephant bearingthe preciousrelics had suddenly died and become a rook."1 
Commenting on this passage Matters remarks : There does not room to fa any mention either of Udyana or of Uttarasena in the Yarious accounts given in the varioun NirvRpa treatises of the division of the Buddha'i relics. But other authorities relate how a tomato elephant named* tto-fo (or Mafca) bearing reKcs of Buddha died suddenly on the way, wtw afterwards reborn as a human, creature and became .an Arhat with an enorniouH apwtilwfl Major Deane identifies the monument mentioned by Hiuen Theang with tlm jvnmiiw of a ttopa which are said still to exist between the Tillages of Ghaligai and ShaxikanJar on ilw, Swut river in what used to be the ancient kingdom of Udy&na. It may be asked, howmr ho^' inasmuch aa the casket is reputed to have come from Kurram, it could be awictHiitod with any monument in the Swat valley, which lies in quite the opposite direction and in a different r^ion This objection can be met, in my opinion, by the fact that, as 1 have otomid at th vwvinherentimpossibility,if we were to snppo* that tlui obj^t l^S?^T^ PkC?f ^rigi31' t0^lo ality Whew ^ntwMy c.o o

No. 4. KANTAKUMARI INSCRIPTION OF VIRA-RAJENDRA-DEYA. BY THE LAM T. A, GOPIKATHA RAO, M.A., 
The village of Kanyakumari, as everyone knows, is situated in the extreme south of India and is a very ancient place of great reputation.It was known to early Greek writers under the names of JKomarta Akron, or Cape Jomaria, as Ptolemy calls it, or simply Komarei., as described by the author of the P&riylus. The latter says :"After Bakare occurs the mountain Pyrrhos (or the Red) towards the south, near another district of the country called Paralia (where the pearl-fisheries are which belongto king Pandion), and a city of the name of Kolkhoi ..... Next to this is another place called Komar, where is the Cape of the same name and a haven. Those who wish to consecrate the closing partof their lives to religion come hither and bathe and engage themselves to celibacy- This is also done by women ;since it is related that the goddess once on a time resided at the place and bathed/'1 Paralia mentioned in this extract is the name of the river Paraliyaru, which! waters a portionof S. Travancore and emptiesitself into the Kulitturai river. I have shown elsewhere^that the land watered by the Parajiyaru was the country belongingto the powerful dynastyof Ay kings, who had their capital at Kottaru, which is mentioned by Ptolemy under the" name of' Kotiara Metropolis' andc Kottara*by Pliny* Prom time immemorial, the Pandyas were the guardians of Kanyakumariand the temple in it ; one of their distinguishing titles being Kanni-kavalan, the guardian of Eanni (i.e. Kanyakumari). 
The templeof the goddess Kanyakumari is situated on the very brink of the Indian Ocean. Oppositeto the central shrine is a mandapa locally known as the manimandapa, which contains six cylindrical stone pillars covered with writing in Grantha (11. 1 to 419) and Tamil (11. 420 to 444) characters. Kanyakumari was visited by the Madras Government Epigraphistin 1896, when an attempt was made by his staff to obtain a mechanical copy of the inscriptions contained on these pillars, but the task was given up as impossible.I tried to copythe inscription in 1910 ; the result was not at all satisfactory. Since then I have visited the place more than once; every time I saw the inscription on the pillars, which is qlearly legible in some places, but more or less completely worn out in others, I was impelled to make a fresh attempt to copy it; and what was to be the last, a serious and determined effort to secure a good impression of the writing on all the pillars, was made in 1916. The first and foremost difficulty experienced by all up till then was that of removing the thick crust of oil and dirt which from a long time past had accumulated on the pillars. This was completely removed after one or two unsuccessfal attempts, and the inscription was found in some places defaced, being corroded by the action of tbe sea-air. Though these parts did not appear legibly on the impression,it was still possible with great difficulty to read the writing on those parts directly from the stone. After straining every nerve to obtain a set of good estampages, with lamp in hand, letter by letter, word by word, the record was decipheredfrom, the original jatone itself. Tbe success is largely due to the indomitable perseverance of my Pandit, Mr. V. Srinivasa Sastri, Smritivi^ftrada ; h and I worked at the epigraph, on the spot, for nearly one month. Most of the verses employ rhymes (jpras&$) 9 which also came in handy by suggesting conjectural readings which in almost all the cases proved, upon reference to the original stone inscription,to be quite correct. Thus then the text was at last nearly com* pleteJy recovered from the worn surface of the pillars. 
The inscription may fitly be called the"Chola-vamga-prasasti*"It is extremely important for the history of the Cholas as it contains many pieces of information hitherto unknown to history. As I think that it is not rightto defer the publicationof this very important document

As has been already remarked, the six pillars are covered with, writing from tho ion fo tho bottom. At first I conceived that the writing went round the pillar in a Kpira! ; but on rlos >r examination ife was discovered that each pillar consisted of two aeciionn, wie 011 the back ftuie and another on. the front.

The true fact seems tc hare been remembered bythe composerof the Tiruvalanga^a document It lias been stated elsewhere that Tanjapuri must have been seized from the Mufctaraiyars, the vassals of the Pallavas, by Vijayakya.3 The son of Vijayalaya was Adityavarmaii alias Kodan4arama. In the village of Tondaraanad near Kalabasti there is a temple of the Chsla period* One of its inscriptions belongingto the 34th yearof the reign of Madiraikoxida, Parakesarivannan, i.e. Parantaka I, calls the temple by the name Kodandtaramelvara aliat Aditye^vara. Mr. Venkayya in his Annual Report on Epigraphyfor the year 190 5, wrote about it thus:"Ho. 318 of 1904 mentions the Mag's son srl-Eodandaramaii while No* 347 of 1904 refers to prince Ksdandan. Even at the present day Kadandaa is a familiar abbreviation of Ksdandararnag, and we may therefore supposethat both Nos. 818 and 347 of 1904 refer to the same prince, who was the son of Parantaka I. In the same village of Tonda manad is another inscription of Parantaka I, dated in Ms 34th year (about A.D. 939), which. mentions the temple of KfldandarameSvara alias Adityesvara. It is not impossible that this temple was called after the ChOla prince ESdandaramaa, If this surmise proves correct, it maybe concluded from the other name Adityeivara given to the To$damaiiad temple that K$dandavaman was the surname either of the king'seldest son Bajaditya or of his second son GandarSditya."4Subsequently, while reviewing No, 286 of the Collectioii of the Madras Epigraphist for. the year 1906, fonnd ia Tirumalpnram which stated that the village of SijEiyaryur had been granted as a devadan and as a brahmadeyain the 21st year of Tondaimanajprur-tunjina-Udaijar, Mr. Venkayya changed his opiiuon and said that Tori{Jai manaiEur-tunjiga-lTdaiyar,i.e.* the lord who died at Tondaima^ajrur/ must refer to Aditya I, that To3p4^i^5rr6r is probably Toodamaaad Bear "Kalahasti in the Nortb Areot District which in a record of Parantaka I found at the place,is called I0ndaim!npi%rur5

We shall see presently that he conquered&l*o Ijara or Ceylonas reportedin the Tiruvalangadu grant.4 
The Kanyakmnari inscriptionstates that Parantafca caused his armyto cross the sea and conquer Simhala ; by killing the lords of Simhala and subjagatingth countryhe obtained the surname Simbalantaka. As it is stated that it was otyly his army that crossed the sea we have to infer that Parantaka I himself did not lead the army to Simha{a, but, entrustingthe invasion to his generals, stopped on the mainland. He ia further stated to have constructed several agraharaslike ViranSrSyaijapura and granted them for the enjoymentof Brakmanas, This Viranarayaijapara seems to be the same m the modemKafctuma^narfcoyil, a suburb of Gangaikondiasajapuram which was the native placeof the great Srivaitthnara Sch&ryas Nathamunigaland Tamunarya alias AjavandSr, 
The eon of Parantaka (I) was Armdama. To Arindama was born a SOE named ParlEtftka (II). Anticipatingtrouble from this valiant king, the Pa^y^ kingfled acro6$ the Mountains, evidentlyto the Kgrala country. Parantaka II fought several battles and imprisoned a largo number of kings.

Kaliiiga and VimSendra1; and to bring the water of tHe Ganges filled in pots carried on the heads of the conquered kings. The latfcer statement regardingthe conquest of Eajendra-Cholaof the countries as far as the Granges is in close agreement with that found in the Tirrrvalaftgadii grant. In both the records it is distinctly mentioned that Rajendia-Ohala alias Madhnrantaka himself did not proceed fc gainst the northern kings and did not. extend iiis arms as far as the Granges by leading the army in person, bat got the credit of having * taken the Gangs river'(Qangai-koncja) by the victories achieved by Ids generals.2 Ttte 
inscription states further . that he sent his army across the sea to the Kataha country-and set fire t<> it* and that there was nothing impossible for this monarch to achieve. This sing, "Madhorantaka (that IB, Rajndra-Gh6la I), had three sons, named (respectively) Eajadhiraja, Bajendra-deva and VIra-BSjendra-deva. Of these, Rajadhiraja was the eldest. For the first time we have the very explicit statement in the inscription tinder notice that Bajeudra-Chola had three sons.4 Up till now the relationship existing between RajSndm-ClioIa and the three brothers, Rajadhiraja, Rajendra-deva and Vira-Rajendra-deva, was vaguely 
conjectured. 
The Kanyakumari inscription states that Rajadhiraja destroyed the city of Ralyanapura and conquered the lord of that place, Ahavamalla. These facts are -well known to students of Indian history by the inscriptions of this king. Kalyanapura was the capitalof the Chalukyas and Ahavamalla was the Chalukya contemporary of Rajadhiraja. 
After the death of Rajadhiraja, his next younger brother Rajendra-deva ascended the throne, and the latter in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother VIraR5,ien.drE-deva. He killed the Mannata (ICarnata ?) kings in the battle at Ku^al-sanganaa. This king, Valla bhavallabha, took possessionof Vengi and Kalinga,6 left uncared fot by his elder brothers and consequently overrun by enemies ; Tlra-Rajendra, who is known, also by the names Karikala and Vira-ChQla, set up several dharma-tiasanas (thafc is, engraved deejls of grants). Hepresented an invaluable ruby, known as trailokya-sara, to the god Dabhra-Sabhapati (the 
god of Chidambaram), and it was set up m the crown of that god. He established anumber of agraharasin the Chela, Tundira, Pandya, Gangavati and Kuluta countries andcolonised them with forty thousand Brahmayas well-versed in the Vedas. From the other inscriptions of this monarch we know that he won a victory over the Chalukya Ahavamalla at Kudalsangama and Koppa and captured all the treasures belongingto his opponent, as also

his women. The fact of his presenting the god Sabhapati with a jewel is quite new. That he established a number of agraharasdoes not appearto be a mere boast; we have area BOW several of them, such as Vsrarajamangalam, Vlrachtflapuram,etc. 
The TamiJ portionof the inscription begins afresh with the phrase 8va$ti Sri and states that the king BSjakesarivarman Vlra-Bajendra, who bore the liruda* and surname**1 Mahai^jadhirSja, RSjSSraya, BSja-Bajendra, Vlra-Chola, KarikIla*Cbt5l% etc., seems to have made a grant of land to the temple of Kanya-Pi^ariylr (Bhagamtf) at Ktxmari (i.e. Eanyafcumari). This portionof the inscription is damaged and cannot be easily deciphered. 
On the whole the Kanyakumari inscription is a valuable document for the construction of the historyof the Chola dynasty. With the Anbil grant,3 the Leiden groat,* the Tiruv&Inft gadu grant* and the Kanyakumari inscription, the four most important document^ the luatory ckf the Chojas could be written completely and satisfactorily. The Tamil works JKatingat tupparani, etc. may also be of great interest in the study of Chflla history. 
The followiogtable gives the genealogy of tlie Cholas as fouud in the Kanyakumari msoriptiou ;ad the genealogies derived from the Tamil works, the Vtfoama-SCfaf^uto, tho and the Sankara-Svlan-uls, are also added for purposes of c'ompariwou.

Putting together the statements of the two sets of literary evidences, I think it is possible for us to infer that the king who presentedto the Srlrangam temple a golden serpent conch must be identical with Rajain alien dra. Since the K&lingattupparani, etc*, place him before Vira-RajencLra, the findingof Dr. Hultzscli receives further strength. It is quite likely that he was made a yuvaraja with the title Rajakesari, that, ^ken his father and uncle were engaged in war with the Chalukyas, he was administering the kingdom in the capacity of the yuvar&ja, but that he died befoie his father and therefore never ascended the throne, As a consequence, when Vlra-Rajendra ascended the throne, in regular succession to Baje^dra-dSva, lie also called himself a Rajakesari.   
The Kanyakumari inscription, which traces the descent of the Ch5las down to Vira-'Rajen* dra, is silent about Kajamahendra, his immediate predecessor. This silence about him is significant and corroborates further the hypothesisof Dr, Htiltzsch.

A set of ink-impressions of this inscription"was sent to me by Rao Bahadur EC. Sastri, who tad received the original platesfor examination3 from Mr* M. Ramabrishnal M.A., Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras. Tke inscriptionis engrared on three obj copper-plates, the second of which bears writing on both sides. The margins of the : inscribed sides are only very slightly raised into rims. The plates measure S" in hei The two first are 7" in breadth^ while the third is cut on the right margin and hence"tae^s only 6-f". The plates are strung on a ring which is 2f" in diameter, and which is pai through a hole of about -|"in diameter. The two ends of the ring are fixed in the base < circular seal of about I%f in diameter which -bears, in relief, the legend tSri-S&rvvasiddhi, wii crescent at the top and an expanded lotus-flower of nine petals at the bottom. The weight the plates, with zing and seal, is 70 tolas,- 
The writing is in a tolerably good state of preservation ; but some aTcsharas, anusva and vowel-marks are indistinct, and at the endr of the first five lines of the third plate, two three letters are lost. The alphabet resembles that of -other early Eastern Chalukya gra: A final form of t occurs in -vasakat (1. 1) and vaset (L 24). The syllable r% is used in Telugu proper names Gfanderw (11. 9 f% aaad 10), Vanneru <? 1Q) Ntduparu (1, 18 f.)i N^ularu (1. 11).

The period of the reign of VishnuvardMnst III (A. D. 709 746)1 would suit this identifica tion. A close connection between both dynasties might be gathered also from the fact that th* panegyrical descriptions of kingsin the Eastern Chalnkya grants remind of those of some Pailavi grants.3

No. 7. ] VAPPAGHOSHATATA GRANT OF JATAlfAGAr   
somewhat nnsuccessfal attemptto translate and annotate the plate, which bears the subscri tion: "R. Mittro, Asiatic Society, 6th December 1854,'* and to which Mr. Greig has prefis the note"Translation of a Copper Plate found in the Indigo Estate at MalKa1 by one of 1 
James Smith's villagers, and presented to me by that gentlemanin January 1855." It consists of a single rectangular plate of copper, slightly irregular in shape, abo 7| in. in width and 5| in, in height* with a circular seal about 3 in. in diameter soldered the properleft side* The seal, which is very much worn, shews traces of an uprightfern* figure, apparently Lakshml, with either one or two elephants performingthe kumbh&bhishe over her, while in the exeigue below there are the remains of a now illegible inscription. Tplate itself, which is inscribed on one side only,is io very good preservation, exceptfor a era running down it, which has been repaired by a small rivet. T\vo or fchi*ee letters at the end L 14 and a whole line of writing immediately following the latter have been deliberate erased. The characters, which have been picked out comparatively recently with whpaint, are of a well-formed upright Gupta type, apparently of the latter half of the sixth ce tury, and average in height a little less than J in. In most respects they are archaic enon| to justify an ascriptionto the fifth century; but the forms of the initial i (iti, L 11) and t bipartite y (passim), make the latter date more probable. The conjunctnasals and consonai are used in preference to the simple consonants with preceding anusv&ra (e.g. *sambh8ga-9 L J F" and b are confused (e.g. -scimbatsare, 1. 2, AudiimvartlJca-], 1. 3, but sa-vrahmach&rine, Lvrahmananarh, L 8, etc.). Internal a is denoted either by a doubly waving line curving upwartowards the right from the top of the shaft (cf. the Sfch and 18th syllables of 1. ]), or by a she upward tick at the right corner of the top'(cf. the 14th syllableof L 1), or by a downward lo from the right corner of the top (cf. the 15th syllable of L 2). Interna! is represented uaual by a waving line similar to the first type of a but in the oppositedirection (e.g. the 18 syllable of L 2), rarely by a perpendicular tick on the left corner of the top ^svamine^ L * Internal o is made with the waving e combined with either the ticked or the downwailooped a. The curve of internal I is sometimes single (e.g. &*, L 2, -sZmd, L 9), sometim double (e.g. gramZna-, 1. 14). The angularity of the base of the tJi (d&$yath=eti, 1. 7) is nol worthy;so also is the combination of the syllable U with a following danda, in which the curvn line denotingi is carried around the t and upwards to the right of it, terminating there in email horizoutal lick on a level with the top of the t (see11. 4, 7, 13), a peculiarity which seei to have been affected by Eastern scribes, as we find it again even as late as the TalchSr plai of Gayada-TungadSra (Bee Nagendranath Vasu's Archwol. Survey of Mayuralhanja, plate to fa p. 154. and /. A*. Soc. Bang., Vol, SET, 1916, No. 6, pi 4, last line). The cursive ryain Suryl(L "3) is also significant* The language is Sanskrit prose, becoming in partsloose and almc dialectal. As already remarked band t? are confused. Lexically we may note the words aJcskayai dharman (1. 6) ; ganginika (1. 9 bis), the modern ganyina, which possibly may be used here as common noun meaning "dry river-bed"(see above, Vol. XTT, p. 66,n. 3, smd p. 78, n. 5), b more probably is the name of a particular river (see below) ; and tamra-patta (11. 8, 11, 13, Hi which here, instead of its primary meaning of"copper-plate"( as above, Vol. VII, pp. 87, 98, Vol. VIII, pp. 152, 157-59), signifies an estate granted under a warrant engraved on copper-plate.2 
The object of the document is to specify the bounds of a certain village named Vappghdshavata granted to the Brahmarir Bhatta Brahmavlra Svamin by the Samanta Narayarbfaadra, and is dated in the reign (the word qualifyingthe samvattLra is unfortunately efface

of Mug JayanSga, who was at the time residingin Karnasuvtonafca, arid who, to judge from Ms title of 'Mbkfr&jSthMj'a, must have b&m a ruler of considerable importance. The docu ment was drawn up in accordance with Naraya^abhad'tfa's instructions by his commissioned (vyamMrin) Stirjrasena* On the principles of this administrative hierarchy the 6tudefet mayprofitably compare the observations of Mr. Badhagovinda Basak in his paper on the Dam5darpnrPlate (above, Vol. XV, pp. 116 ff). 
Of JayaBaga we know nothing from other sources. But Mr. John Allan has suggested to me thai he may be the same as the king whose coins, described in his Catalogue of the Coins of the Gupta Dynasties (Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum), pp. Ixi, civ., cvi, ficcdii, 150-51, and pL xsiv, bear oja the obverse the abbreviated name Jaya and on the reverse a seated Lakghml with an elephant sprinklingher. This connection seems highly probable. In any case, the present document furnishes an importantfact concerning the early history of Karaasuytirna, which, token in connection with the Nidhanpur grant of Bhaskaravannan (above, Vol. XII, p. 65), supplies material for interesting speculation. 
The names of places mentioned, besides Kar^asuvar^iaka (L 1), are the Audumvarlka*vislxaya (L 3); the villages of Vappaghoshavata (1. 6), Kutkuta-grftma (11. 8, 14), and Axnala* pautika-grama (L 10) ; G-anginika (L 9, bis), literally"river,1 ' which here is perhaps used as a proper name ; the Sarshapa-yanaka or"mustard-channel" (1. 10); -and the pool of Vak&ata Eumalika (1L 13-14). On the geographical positionof Karjiasuvarriaka, the ancient capital of the kingdom of the same name, see T, Waiters, On Yuan Qhwang, Vol. II, p, 191-93, and BL Beveridge, The Site of Karna Suvarna, in J. A. 8, JB., 1893. pp. 315 f., the latter of whomidentifies it with Eafigamati, near Hnrshidabad, which is said to have been formerly known as Ka^stea or KinsOna, a name which phonetically corresponds perfectly to Ea^asuvarnaka, through an intermediate Prakrit .form Kpnnasonnaa.1 On the other names I am indebted to Mr. S. .K. Chatt^rji, M. A., D, Lit., for the following observations. The Gaftginika seems to be the river Jalangl, a branch of the Ganges or Padm& which unites with the Bhagirathl ne$r Kadiya, the classical Navadvipa. The Bengali poet Bharatachandra Ifcaya (c- 1740 A.D,) in his Anmadarmafyala (pp. 136 and 151 of Mnktararaa Vidyavaglsa's edition, Calcutta, 1857) speak$ of the ancestors of the Rajas of Nadia as living in the parganah of Bagw&n (Bagioftn) at a village called Andalija :"Ganga herself i.e. the Bhigirathl to the west, to the east the Gttginl- there is the village of BadagacM ; opposite to it, on the other side of the nver, Is Anduliyf In the Survey map of the Nadia Diaijriet Bagwgn is a village in the Mehcrrpnr sub-division, and closejo it, on the two sides of the Jalftngj, are the villages of Ba^gaehi ( Bnigachee' J) and Anduliya ( Andooleeay>), as stated by Bharatachandra. It ueems likely that this river Jalaigi is the Gangimka of the present record. North of B&gwn at sotoe distance from the Jalangi,fs an important village named Ginganl, which may -possibly presagethe name of the Ganginika. Eivers in the plains often change their courses- None of the othei place-names can be located. But it ^ay be noted that VappaghSshavata fyapp* is the B*yh &*,*latter/' and gUsha-vata= -dwelling of herdsmen") would be a m likely village^name Souther Mnhifln*a and Nadia, where there was much cattle-breedmg.

The subjoined two inscriptions. are engraved on the south wall of the Siva temple , & village situated on the north bank of the Kaveri in the Mayavaram taluk of the Tanjore district. This temple is one on which the Saiva saint Sundaramftrti-NSyanar of the 8th century has composed hymns. Though the preservation of the records is not good, there are enough traces left in them to make out the inscriptions almost completely. It would have been certainly much better if they had not suffered damage.I am editing theinscriptions from impressions secured duringthe field season of 1921-22 by Mr. A. S. Eamanathier of the office of tire Assistant Archaeological Superintendent for Epigraphy, Madras, and registered as Wos. 534 and 535 of Appendix B of the Annual Report on Epigraphy for thatyear, where, however the 
importanceof these metrical records has not been noted.' The two inscription^ are dated in the reign of Kul6ttunga-Ch6|a. The kin* bears no : but to judge from the characters employed, the records appear to be distinguishing epithets 
of the fame of Zulottunga^ who reigned from A.D. 1070 to 1119. The 46 and 38 high regml years 
given to the kuig m these records also point to the same conclusion. As wiU b. shown below the znsmptxons are of great.value to student, of Tamil Hterafare as they almost fii the fame of one 01 the most important works on Tamil Prosody

Yappamngalakkarigaiis generally"believed to l)e a mucli earlier work. IB. discussing tlie date of Chvl&mawi, one of tlie five smaller Jcavyas of Tamil, the late Mr, C. W. Damodaram Pillai wrote the following:l 
** Several stanzas from the Ghnlamani have been cited as examples in the Y&pparungala* virutti and in the commentary2 written in the interval between Sa-ka 200 and 300 by Gnnasagara on the YapparungalaJcJcarigaiof Anmdasagara which was based on Yapparungal avirutti. As it is known from the introductory verse of the Cbulamani that that work was composed during the reign of Vijayaraja who ruled from the cityof Karvetinagar in Chslaman dalam and as that city was earlier than Urandai, the work must be not less than 1,500 years old." 
It is not possibleto ascertain whence Mr. Damodaram Pillai obtained the date"between Saka 200 and 300"for Gunasagara's commentary and what his authority was for the state ment that"Karvetinagarin Solamandalam was earlier than Urandai (i.e. TJraiyur)." There are literary evidences to show that Uraiyur in the Trichinopolydistrict and Kavirippum pattinam in the Shiyali taluk of the Tanjoredistrict were the capitals of the Cholas prior fe> Tanjore. But there is none so far to the effect that Karvetinagar was even a famous city. Neither was this situated in Gh5la-mandalam. Evidences, both literary and epigraphical, would point to Karvetinagar having been included in Tondai-mandalam. We shall discuss the upper limit of Gunasagara's age after citing the opinionof Pandit M. Eaghava Aiyangar on the date of Yapparungalakkarigai. Writing on the age of Mandalapnrusfca, the author of the Tamil Nigantfu, he says that"there are ample reasons that -confirm that Amritasagara could not have lived before the 10th century A.D."3 and it is prettycertain that he must have with him materials to provehis point. These are the only two definite pronouncements that we know of regardingthe date of Yapparnngalakkarigai,besides the statement of Mr. Narasimhacharya which will be referred to later on. 
It is interestingto note here the account preservedin the Tamil literature respecting Amudasagaraand his work* From the invocatory stanza of his work it is learnt that the author was a Jain, for it is addressed to the Arhat under the shade of the A5ka tree4. Gunasagara, the Jain commentator on YapparungalakMrigaiyhas the following say on the name of the work and the method adoptedin its composition: 
"Like the Prakrit grammar P&littiyam and Pingalam otherwise called OhTiandopisitamJ* this work (i.e. Yapparungalakkarigai)is made of Karigai*verses ;and like the Karnataka Ghhandas GunaJcanhiya, each stanza is addressed to a female and is concise. It cites 
examples like the Mahesvara- Y&ppul ;like the SeyyntturaiJckdvaiof Tamil music ; like the VargaTckZvai*of the Ashtakas in the Vedas and like the NitaJca-titoJcas of the Rupa,Zatara, it gives the commencing portionsof the verses cited as examples. As the Nirutta

The word "Karigai means beauty, woman, the metre called EaUalaiTdcaJlM^ai and the work on prosody known as Tapparunffala&kariffai.It is here used in the sense of the last. According to the Amar*, KBriki means Vritti. In Sanskrit it means the corciae statement in verse of any certain doctrine. 
' Though this work is not now extant, stray stanzas from it are foand quoted by Gunasagara himself in hit commentary, e.g. see his comment on v. 17.

the aboT* extracts the chief pointsto be noted are : 
1. That the yy,<mffir patttila, does not name the four communities mentioned in it as professing Christianity or any other religion;it simply implies- that there resided four communities dbaely allied to each other by similarity ofinterests, namely, trade, eta 
2. That the ManigrSmam community is not peculiarto the Malabar Coast alone and that it was found in the interior also, as evidenced by the Tiruvellajai inscription. 3. That Hindu institutions were placed under their px'oteqtion^ which would, mot lag possible if they belonged to the Christian community1;and 
4. That it is simply the name ol a certain corporation or community, p>*&a?ps engagedin trading, like the Valanjiyars,as Mr. Venkayya suggested. 
The Rev. Mr. Peet opined,as alreadyreferred to, that the Manigramakk5rswere originally Christians find that a sorcerer, Manikkavachakar, onTerted them to Hinduism. It i& laard to believe that the conservative Hindus, who, in thes& daya of free thomg-kt wfus^ t$ take back even converted Hindus into Hinduism, would in those ancient times have consented to take wholesale communities of entirelyalien religionists into their fold. Again,it is iwH known, that

If Manigr&m&tfar in the Tiruvellami instiriptiom, were to "be taken as the name of a Christian trading community of the Malabar Coast, how was it possible for N&rftyanaix Acheha;g, who, fewa Ms name, may certainly be taken to be a Hiwlu a*nd mot at all a Christian, to belong**** the Christian

"However little credit we may be disposedto giveto the story about the conversion of the king of Ceylon, or to the identification of that king with, the Gothakabhaya of the MaTiavamia^ I see no reason for hesitating to believe the Indian tradition that Manikkavasagar visited Malabar and reconverted two families of Christians to Hinduism* The desceiidents of those families, who are still known as Manigramakars, are not admitted to full privileges as caste Hindus. Some traditions place the reconversion as having occurred itbout A. D. 270, If that date be at all nearly correct, the Malabar Church must be considerablyolder. So far as I can appreciate the value of the arguments from the history of Tamil literature, there seem to be good independentreasons for believing that Manikkavasagar may have lived in the third century. Some authors even place him about the beginning of the second century.1 If he reallylived so early, his relation with the Church in Malabar would confirm the belief in its apostolic origin." 
Evidently the name Sanghamitra, occurring in the Hahavafasa, could not belong to the Jain or Hindu community ;but since he is called a Tamil heretic therein, we must take Mmto be a Mahayanist, who, to the Hlnayanist,is a heretic. There is nothing againsthis being a Tamil Buddhist, but it is impossibleto identify him with a Tamil Hindu, as "was attempted by Mr. K. G. Sesha Ayyar. The descriptionof Safighamitra as "versed in the teachings concern ing the exorcism of spirits and so forth" clearly evidences bis mastery of the Bauddlia Tantrism and never pointsto a Hindu. Manikkavasakar refers to Varaguna-Pandya twice in his TiruGfacJiirr(*wibala~kk6vai and this Varaguna is the same as the Vara.guna-Maharfl.ja who was crowned in A, D. 86 2; and I have long ago arrived at the conclusion that Manikkavasakar lived in the first half of the 10th century.8 
No Tamil work dealing with the life, of MSnikkavasakar states that he went to the West Coast of the Madras Presidency. They are uniform in asserting that he went to Tirupperttn dujai, or the modern Avadaiyark5yil, in thp eastern partof the Presidency, He must have gone to purchasehorses brought down from Pegu and other placesin the east places which were familiar to the Tamils. It is only when the Arabs came to the West Coast in mediaeval times that horses were imported from Arabia. Till then the chief sources of the supply of horses must have been the Eastern Archipelago and Burma.

BY THE LATE PAKDIT V. NATESA AlYAR, B.A., M.R.A.S. 
The villageof GSpalpnr is situated some three miles to the south-east of Bheraghat popularly known as4 The Marble Rocks/ in the JnbbulporeDistrict ; it lies on the right bank of the Narmada. The village contains only a few scattered houses: owing to its secluded position the placeis seldom visited by travellers or tourists. Sir Alexander Cunningham, the pioneer archaeologist, however, seems to have visited the spotin the winter of 1874; for in one of his reports he gives an account of an inscribed stone tablet of the Chgdi dynasty which, he says, was discovered there previously by Professor Hall.8 It was this fact alone which induced me to explore the place while I was encampedat Bheraghat some eight years ago. Although, unfortunately, the inscription in question could no longer be traced, I was lucky enough 1o discover within a fortified enclosure, which, I learnt, was then in the occupationof a certain. ,named Vindhya-sftri,five elegantly carved stone imagesof the medieval period.

other copper-plates1 of a similar nature had, however, been fotmd in the Faridpur district in 1891 and 1892 and been purchased for the Asiatic Societyof Bengal by Dr. Hoextale. These, after various vicissitudes, were taken in hand1 by Mr, Pargiter and publishedin the 'Indian Antiquary of July, 1910, in a veiy able and critical toticle. The publication of these plates necessitated reconsideration of Mi1 . Banerji's propositions-9 which he did in an article published in the J. A. 8- B., June, 1911. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Pargiter published an article in the August, 1911 number of the J. A. 8. J?., which was based on the first article of Mr. Banerji and was evidently written before Mr. Pargiter had occasion to see Mr. Banerji's second article. In it, Mr. Pargiter very ably defended the genuineness of the Faridpur plates and published a revised reading of the GlmgrSMlti plate, which went a long way towards clearingit from the aspersionof ambiguity and unintelligibility cast on it by Mr. Banerji* Mr, Pargiter also showed, by discussing the paleographyof the grant, that it was not spurious, but a per* fectly genuine one. Mr. Banerji answered this article in his paper entitled"Four forged grants from Faridpur"in J. A. 8. J?,, Dec., 1914, but had no better success than before in maintaining his ground, tThe recent discovery of five plates from the village of Damodarpur in the Dinajpur district of Bengal, and their publication by Prof. B. G. Basak in the Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XV, must perhaps induce Mr. Banerji now to reconsider his decision, as these plates' bear close family resemblance to the Faridpur plates both as regards palaeography and documentary form. In this article I shall not only try to furnish additional reasons, if any are at all required,for the recognition of the Faridpur platesas genuine, but also hope to identify the Maharajadhir&ja Samachara-dgva as one of the kings who took the place of the Guptas in Eastern India towards the end of the 6th Century A. D. It will be seen that in. the presentationof the text and translation also, I have been able to improve upon Mr. Pargiter's reading "6f the plate in several important points. 
I refrain from givingthe usual descriptionof the plates,its orthography, etc., since these have been completely dealt with by Messrs. Banerji and Pargiter, but proceed at once to give the text which I have read from the original plate, now in the Dacca Museum. Before doing so, I give, in brief, the contents of the inscription.It refers itself to the 14th year of the reign of a hitherto unknown emperor Samachara-deva who is styled MaharajadhirSja. In that year, Jlvadatta was the viceroy or governorin MavyavaksSikS, which appears to have been the Divisional head-quarters. The District Officer in the district of Varaka-mandala approved by Jlvadatta was Pavittroka. The latter was assisted in his administration by a District Court presided over by the Judge Damuka. The affairs' of the village or locality to which thia refers, were in the joint care of a number of Elders (VisMya-Mahattar&ty, of whom six are mentioned as in the second plate of DharmmSditya (Ind. Ant:, July, 1910 p. 200). Other men of experiencein the village had also a sayin village affairs. These represented the villagers and like the Panchayets of the present day, transacted the ordinary civil and criminal affairs of the village. 
Supratika Sv&mi, a Brahman, approachedthe District Court presided over by Damuka as well as the Elders* and meb, of experience of the locality and appliedfor a pieceof waste land of that locality for settling himself on it- The Elders and the men of experience decided to give Mm the piece of land free of any consideration, and after authorising KSfiava, RTayaniga and

(Liues 12 17*) Wherefore, the above-enumerated Elders and others who were skilled in Law, receivingthis petition and calling to mind (the following ttoka'):* The land which is full of pits and which is infested with wild beasts, is unpx^ofitaTble to the king "both as regards, revenue and religious merit. That land, if made capable of being used, does bring revenue and merit to the king himself'; and having decided'Let it be given to this Brahmana' and having recognised (i.e. constituted) the Karanikas Naya-Naga, Kesava and others as the repre sentatives of the public1 and having separatedthe three hulya sowing areas2 of land previously granted away by a copper-plate, (the aforesaid gentlemen)established the land that remained in "Vyaghra-choraka by the issue of a copper-plate,after the demarcation of boundaries, as being (henceforward)in the possessionof this Supratlka Sv^mL 
(Lines 18 20.) And the boundary indications are these : On the east, the goblin haunted Parkkafcti tree; on the south, the Vidyadhara Jotika3; on the west, the corner of Chandra varmman's fort; on the north, the boundary of the village Gftpndra-eh5raba. 
(Linos 20 23.) And here applythe verses : The grantor of land delights in heaven for sixty thousand years.

Whoever takes away land granted by himself or others becomes wormin his own ordure and rots there along with his ancestors.

Now, I proposeto discuss the various issues raised by the inscinption. The first pointis the determination of the identity of Sam&chsra-deva, 
Mr. Pargiter has pointed out that even if the grant were spurious, no forger would be so foolish as to date it in the reign of a king who never existed (J. A, S. JBM August, 1911, p. 499), We can adthxce gtronger proofsof his existence, I refer to the two gold coins-, described as * Uncertain' on pp. 120 and 122 of the Catalogue of tVnW, L M. CM Vol. I, and illustrated as NOB, 11 and 18 on Plate XVI. They are both of gold (considerably alloyed with silver). One 
of them, of the Rajalila type, was found near Muhamnmclpnr in the Jessore distiict of Bengal along with a gold coin of Saftnka, and another gold coin of the light-weight"Imitation Gupta'1 type, as well as Bilver coins of Chandra- Gupta, Skonda-Gupta and Kumara-Gupta (Allan, Cata logue of Qupta Cains, IntrocL, Sec, 171, and /, J, 8. B., 1852, Plate XII), The provenance of the other coin in unknown. It is of the .common Archer Type of Gupta coins. The king's name occurs below the right arm, of the king, A letter occurs between the feet of'the king which Dr. Smith recogninecias Oha. The reverse legend is recognised as Narendra-Vmata with some hesita tion* Of the Rajnlila coin, he read the name of the king on tlie obverse as Tamadha written in characters of the close of the sixth century A, D, and the reverse legend as Nar^ndradltya. Mr. Allan, in his Catalogue of Gupta Coins, attributes the* Archer Type*coin to a period earlitT than that of Sa$iika (Intro,, p. LXI), and, from the supplanting of the Garuda Standard of the Guptas by the Bull Standard on thin coin, surmises that the coin was of a devout Sawa, The 
1 Mr. Pargitor explains fadavdran as referees or arbitrators. The word is composed of two section* f fada and, ?$ra; the former means the chief, the head; and the latter means the common populace, the public. Hence th Meaning-* the chief men of the people*

Hue's, name lie reads hesitatingly (Sec. 165)as Saha or Samdcha or Yamacha, and thus wants to connect It with the Eajalila coin OB which he reads the king's name a^s Yam&cha. The reverse lee/end lie reads on both the coins as Narendraditya. 
In the Arcl&ological Survey Reportfor 1913-14, Mr. R, D6 Bauerji discusses these two coins again. He observes that the name of the king on the obverse of both the ooixis is the same, viz. YamS. The reverse legend is read as Narendravinata. 
A careful studyof the two coins will convince any scholar that the name of the king ia the same on both the coins and it cannot be read as anything else than Samaska (**wn^0and the reading is confirmed when we come to know of a contemporary king Samaehara-tleva by name, whose capper-plate inscription was discovered not far from the find-spotof one of these coins (the Eajalila coin) and the lettering of whose name, as written on his copper-plate, closely agrees to the lett&ring on these cows. The coins may therefore be assigned to Samachftra* deva of the Ghugrahati plate and they furnish proofs, hitherto wanting, of his existence and reign and of the genuinenessof the Qiuigrahati plate.

These methods of marking 8 appear to he indiscriminate. 
To the rightof the kwg appears a standard surmounted "by a bull. The Bull Standard wo aid indicate that the king was a devout Saiva and belonged to a line different from the Gupta line so long predominant.

(2) Samachara must, on palseographic grounds ,be placed earlier than Sasaiika in chrono logy ;also because there Is no placefor Samachara In chronology after Sa&inka* whose immediate successors in Eastern India were rirst Harsha and then Aclityji-Sena and his descendants. 
(3) He was a devout Saiva. The cuiitinuance of the Bull Symbol by Stisanka, as well as ike facts (a) that the Rajalila coin was found with a coin of Sasaiika, (6) that Sasanka^s lineage and parentage have netfer yet been satisfactorily established, maSce it almost certain that Samaehara was a predecessorof SasSnka In tlie kingdom of Gaudaand of tiie same lineage, 
perhaps Ms father. 
(4) The Rajalila coin may be later than the other coin, as it shows a distinctly greatei* change from the almost conventional typeof the latter. 
Two other kingsstand connected with Samachara-deva, viz. Maharajtidhiraja Oharmtna dityaand Maharajadhiraja Gflpa- Chandra of the Faridpur plates published by Isir. Purgiter, In order, therefore, to losate the positionof these kingsin the chronology of tiie country,it is necessary to clear tip,if possible, some doubtful pointsixl the chronologyof the Gupta kings and their successors duringthe sixth century A.D. The publication by Prof. Basak of the five plates of the Gupta kings Kumara- G-upta, Budha- Gupta and Bhana (P)-Grupta (Above, Vol. XV., No. 7) has givenall students into rested, the opportunityof rediscussing the matter. 
The evidence of the Bharsar hoard (Allan, Q-uptA Coins, Intro., li), in which coins of Bamudra-Qupta, Chandra-Gupta II, Kumara- Gupta I, Skanda- Gupta and Prakasaditya were found buried together, made possible the natural deduction that Prakasaciitya succeeded Skanda-Guptaand the hoard was buried in Prukasaditya's reign. No one has yet succeeded in solving the problem who this Prakasaditya was, and the purityof gold in his gold coins has been a puzzle.It may be now: acceptedthat Kumara-Gupta II was the SOIL and successor of Skanda- Guptaand so we must see if he cam be connected with the coins bearing the legend Prakasaditya. These coins are all o the* horseman'type and the letter which signifies the kind's name on the obverse has been taken to be an otherwise inexplicable Bu (Allan, pp. 135^36, Plate XXII, Nos, 1-6), I think,- however, that this readingwill have to, be revised. The letter on coin No. 1 is almost certainly Ku9the matra, or the top horizontal line being very prominent, though unfortunately mixed upwith a band hanging from the saddle of the horse, On coins Nos. 3 and 4, -this letter is indistinct, while on coins 2 and 6 the letter certainly look like TU. The letter on coin No. 5 has been made in one stroke, thus^tj and it is hardly possible to read it as . This, I think, will have to be taken as KM, and the letters on Nos. 2 and 6 also as Ku,9 executed as badly as the horse and the horseman on the coins are. 
Several scholars have attemptedto identifythis Kumara-Gupta with Kum,ra-Gupta, the son and successor of Narasimha- Gupta, and to thrust in the reignsof Nara and Pura between G.E. 148467 A.D., the last known date of Skanda-Gupta, and G.E. 154=473 A.D., the first known date of Kumara-Oupta. By this arrangement, Budha and Bhanu are to be placed after Pura, Nara and Kumara, This is a rather risky proposal There is no certainty that 467 A.D. is the last date of Skanda. Similarly 473 A.D, may not be the first fate of 
umara. If these two date approach, each other by even one year, Pura and Kara have barely four years left between them. The find of coins, which, presupposestheir currency in a locality, is more or lens a sure measure of the importance and Duration of the reign of kings represented by them and the extent of their kingdom. The British Museum Catalogue describes 12 coins and the Indian Museum Catalogue6 coins of Nara ;4 and 3 coins respectively of Pura are described in the British Museum Catalogue and in the Lucknow Museum Catalogue.I have seen a num ber of coins of Nara in the Nahar Collections of Calcutta and in the collection of the Vanglya Sahitya Parishajb of Calcutta, Some more coins of "Nara are to be found in the possession of Eai M-ritynnjay Chondhnri Bahadur of JRangpur.

Pura and- Kara were undoubtedlysuccesHora to the G'npfci throne, at a time which, wehare yet to determine, with very much diminished power and territory. Their coins have beer* found exclusivelyin Eastern India and it is hardly reasonable to place a real emperor like Budlia after Pura and.Nara who were perhaps only kings of Eastern India. 
Karasimha-Gupta Baladityais generally credited with standing against Mihiratula inMagadha. The claims of BO other Baladitya have yet been substantiated. Mihirakula cannot be put earlier than* the beginningof the sixth century A.D. ami the proposition to pixt Baladitya between circa 470 and 473 A,D. makers him precede Mihiralcula by half-a-centuiy. 
IVom the Haraha inscription (Above,Vol. XIV, No. 5), Sarvvtxvarmman and his sonArautivarmman's date can be putas 5(50 A.D. onwards. Tu the Deo- Bamark inscription .of Jiyita-Supta, the Paramefvara Baladityais spokenof as preceding Sarvvavtirniman and Avanfci varmman. Sarrvavarinman, the father of Avautivarmman, WSIH the immediate predecessor of the latter, and the presumptionis thai Baladitya also preeoded Sitrvvsivarinman closely, gay, by not more than a generation. Thjfits in. well if liulfulitya's date is ciroit 530 A, t>. But Baladitya becomes too far off from Barvvavnrnnuan if lio i,s put at 470 A.D. 
Again, the history of the founding of the Nalancla nioiuiHttn-y, as rei^ordcd: by Yuan Chwanjj Li evidently rather confused. But the ineniion of Budha-Gupla as a predoceswor of Baladitva. is significant, and is, in my opinion,iu true chrouolojjicjalor'ilur.

From, the acknowledgment about the same time of "fcte suzerainty ,of the Guptas in the eastern parts of the country (modern Central Provinces) by the Parihrjaka Maharajas .and. Maharajas of Uchchakalpaj Prof. Basak has -been led to suppose (J5p. TwdL, XV, 7, p. 125) that Btianu-Gupta was the victor in the battle in which G5paraja was killed. But I -do not think that the supposition is reasonable. The following facts should be considered : 
(i) Goparaja who appears to ha^e been a powerful ally of Bhanu-Gupta was killed in the battle, 
(ii) If Bhanu-Gupta were victorious, the fact would certainly have been mentioned. Victory lay on the other side, hence the silence and the consolation of some high-sounding adjectives. 
(it*) Bhanu-Gupta had evidently lost his former power; for, had he still been the suzerain,, the fact would have been mentioned; and the loss of power can only result from defeat iu battle in such a situation. 
(iv) The suzerainty of TOramaria is acknowledged by Dhanya-Vishnu, king of Eran, while some years previously he and his elder brother M&tji--Vishnu had acknowledged Bndha-Gupta as the suzerain.1 
From these it Appears to be clear that th# contest between Bhanu-Gupta and the aggres sive Toramana took placein Era# abo,ut 1.91 G,E.=310 A.D., and that the battle resulted in the Gupta Emperor being worsted and having to cede Mal-wa to the invader, Bhanu-Gupta was probably killed in action, as was his faithful ally Gfrparaja, and also perhaps Matri Vishnu ; or, if Bh^nu-Gupta survived, he is not likely to have survived long. 
Thus from Skanda-Gupta to Bhanu-Gupta we have an unbroken line of succession, Where, then, is the place for Pura-Guptaof the Bhittari seal and his line ? Mr, Allan and others have assumed that duringthe latter days of Skanda-Gupta, Pura-Gupta, his brother or half-brother, revolted and established an independent principality (Allan, .Intro., See. 62). Butwhere was this principality? We find Budha-Gupta implicitly obeyed from Malwa to Paundra vardhana. Where is the placein which Pura-Gupta or his successors were obeyed? 
Prof. Basak wrote (Ep. Ind.9 XV, p. 120) :"But with our present stock of knowledge, it is not very easy to indicate the place where the branch line headed by Pura-Gupta may have ruled ; ,........... It may be believed that the rulers of the stronger branch may, by courtesy and in good-will, have suffered the other branch to rule somewhere in the eastern portion of the Gupta empire, perhapsin south Bihar.11 
Such courtesy to a branch whose originwa"S in revolt would be, to say the least, impolitic. The truth seems to be that Pura-Gupta was a child of four or five1 when Kumara-GuptaI died and Skanda-Guptasucceeded him on the throne, and that the child was brought up in the harem,? as his name signifies. When the last king Bhanu-Gupta of the main line died, possibly without leaving anya uccessor, this Gupta prince, the grand-uncleof the last two kings, who mustp.ow have reached an age of &t least 60 years, was called to fill the vacant throne. If subsequent researches prove my inference to be correct, a tragedylike the crowningof Pura-Guptahas seldom happenedin history. 
Prim-Gupta cannot have reigned for more ibaa a few years and the accession of his son BfarasiiiiharGupta Baladitya may be dated in 196 G.E.:=5i5 A.D. Mihirakula may have succeeded his father at Sabala about this time. 
'We know from Yuan, Chvvang that Mihirakula invaded the kingdom,of B&laditya, who is called king of lf&g&4k$i, In the war that ensued Mihirakula seems to have been taken

prisoner and condemned to death, but was saved from death bytlie intervention of the mother of Baladitya (VatsadevI). This contest may be dated about 525-530 A.D.1 
I leave out of discussion the positionof Yasfldharman and Vishuu-vardhana in chrono logy as it has hardly nuy bearing on the present scheme. 
UTacasiinha-Gupta Baladitya did not probably long survive his victory over Mihirakula, and the accession of the next king Kumara-Gupta III may be dated in G-.E. 213=532 A.D. The last Damodarpur plateis dated in 214 G.E. and it was issued during the reign of a Gupta whose name "uas been broken away. I have reasons to thiuk that he was Kumara-Gupta III Prof. Basak supposesthat only two letters have been broken a\vay and lost;but the letter ra, the last letter of Kumara, which is simply a perpendicular stroke, does not occupy muchspace, and further discoveries will, I think, show that the Gupta king rulingin the Bast in 2U G.E. =533 A.D. was Kumara-Gupta III, son of Baladitya. 
On the testimony of the Kalighat hoard2 which contained coins of Baladitya, Kumara Gupta III, Chandra-Gupta III and Vislirua (Gupta ?)-Ckandraditya>we may take the successor of Kumara-Gupta II as Chandra-Gupta III, who appearsto have been succeeded by one whose name began with Vishnu and whose title was Chandraditya.3 We cannot Bay definitely who this Vishnu was. But there cannot be any doubt that he was . of the imperial Gupta line, as the Garuda standard on his coins would signify. 
For the remaining period,until the first established date of Sasafcka in 600 A,D*, Eastern India was ruled, as Mr. Pargiter has demonstrated, by the emperors Dharmaditya, &6paChandraand Samachara. It has been already pointed out that Samachara was a devotee of Siva; and it does not seem an impossible conjecture that all these kings were related to one another and formed a dynasty that took the placeof the Guptasin Eastern India. 
TOPOGBAPHY. 
As already pointed out, Varaka-maiidala was the name of the distract. 
About the position of Varaka-mandala I am in substantial agreement with Mr. Pargiter and I tl^ink that he is rightin thinking that Varendra or Varendrt is derived from the same root. The word V&raJca means obstructing, opposing; ma tidala means a collection of small areas. So the word Varaka-wiandala should be taken to mean, an area of land consistingof smaller. amis lying between and separating rivers; Varaka may also be taken in the sense of 'the deltaic land that obstruats and alters the current of a river1; Varaka-mandala would then be a group of deltaic areas. Anyway, Va-aka-mandala would be the district round Kotalipa45 in the presentdistrict of Faridpur, almost in the heart of what was anciently known as Vanga, 
Kotalipada is at present a Parganah in the district of Faridpar. The old settlement was in and about the old mud fort there, in the vicinityof which the Ghugrahati plate of Samachara-deva was found. A number of gold coins of the Gupta emperors have been found outside the western par or embankment of the fort. 
1 Prof. H. Koyehandhari's objections to identify Namsiiutia-Gnpta Baladitya with the conqueror of Mihirakula do not appear to be very sound (J. A. 8. JB., Vol. XVII, p. 315). Even allowing that Yuan Chwang's statements regard ing Baladitya's predecessors are historically accurate, Tathagata is not stated to be t}\e father of Baladitya nor Budha of Tathigata, and there is no mention of immediate succession. Baladitya's son is Ixamara-G'ipta. Yuan Chwaug gives Ms name as Vajra ; hut evidently this is a pot name or a, family name* and not the royal name* Sec Allan, Intro,, Sec. 166-169 and pagos 137-146.

Kotalipa^a is at present surrounded on all sides by big marshes;it is inconceivable that any saue man could think of *royal settlement in sucli a water-logged area. Bat the big fort is there, and brick constructions very often come up unexpectedly from low water-logged places, As correctly surmised by some scholars, the low level of Kot-alipidla appears to be the* effect of subsidence due to earthquake. We find a new town NiwyavakSfiika springing up during the reign of Uharmmaditya which does not seem to have existed in the third year of the same king, The presumptionis that, about the fifth or sixth year of the reign of Dharmmftditya, owini* to an earthquake, marshes be?g*m to form round Kotallpada which had been a flourishing royat settlement for the past two centuries and a half, and necessity was felt for shifting the gubernatorial head-quarters to some new and safer .site on more settled land* Kotallpada continued as a- district head-quarters, but the value of its land decreased so much that we find almost a whole village,\vliu-.jt is described as having long lain fallow, given away to a Brahmin for uo consideration, 
Where was Hayyavakasfci,, the new Divisional hearl-quarteis ? !NSgadeva had his head quarters at Nuvyiivak&sika, whi >h from the very name appeal's to have "b^en a recently founded town during the reigmof Dha-rrnraaditya, in the interval between the plates A and Bpublished by Mr. Pargiter. 
AvalcSsa means an opening, an aperture, and its derivative avaMsifea may very veil mean a kh&l, a canal, and the whole name Navyavakasika would mean, the place provided with a new cunal. There is a placecalled Sabhar fin the Dacca district which contains imposingruins of a traditional king called Harisehandra. Numerous gold coins of the' Imitation Gupta$ type have been found exclusively from S&bhar* The Dacca Museum cabinet possesses eight such coins from Sabhar. Tlie place contains a fort, 250 yards by 190 yardsin area. A water course breaks ofE from the river Baiigsai about two miles above the place where the fort stands and after running throughthe eastern partof the site 'of the old town, turns to the west ani re-enters the river just below tbe southern face of the fort. The canal, which is undoubtedly in part artificial, is locally called Katagaaga' the dugout river '. The ruins of the royal palaces and templesare situated on the south-east comer of this enclosure, outside the Katagaaga. This old site appearsto answer to the name Navyavakl&ka verywell. The discovery of' Imitation Gupta*goldcoins throughoutthis site distinguishesit from any other aid site in Eastern Bengal and also shows that its foundation goes back to the time we are discussing 
It would thus appearthat tbe ruins at Sabhlr may be identified with Navyavakasika. Tin word Sa&fcffr, a corruptionof Sambhara, means fullness, wealth, affluence. A visit to the site will convince anyonethat it was a well-planned city of very greataffluence surrounded by an artificial water-course. The latter might have been the cause of its name Navyivakasika, while its subsequent opulence and splendour earned for it the name of Sambhara" Wealth and plenty materialised," 
It is easy to provethat Kotalip5dais the older of the two ancient sites. Below we shall show that tbe fort at Kotalipadadates from a period previousto the Ghxptes, but the, discoveryof the gold coins of the Gupta emperors exclusively from this site and onlycoins of the* Imitation Gupta'tvpe, which were undoubtedly much later currency, from Sabhar tends to show tuat the discovered at Kotalipadaor the 'Imitation Gupta'coins from Sabhar. ^*>* 
former aito is the more ancient of the two. It is needless to notice in detail the gold. article in the Numismatic Supplementto the J. A. 8. B. It may only be stated

No. 12. JODHPUH INSCRIPTION OF PRATIHAEA BAUKA; V. S. 894. Br R. 0. MAJUMJUR, MJL, PH.D., DACCA. 
This inscription was first edited, without any translation and facsimile, by MunsMDeviprasad of Jodhpur in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society^ 1894, pp.1 ff. I re-edit it fit the fiuggestion of, and from an estaxnpage kindly suppliedto* me by Professor D, R. Bbandar* kar. The stone which bears this inscription was discovered about 1892, in the wall surrounding the city of Jodhpnr, but, as Professor Bhandarkar suggests,it was probably brought there from Mandor, five miles to the north of the city.1 
The inscriptionconsists of twenty-two lines of writing which cover a spaceof about 2;-10^ broad by 2'~1|" high.It is generallyin a good state of preservation, although some letters have peeled off here and there. The engraving is remarkably excellent, The size of the letters is between f"and f. The characters are of the type used in the inscriptionsof the Imperial Pratlhara dynasty, but the following peculiarities may be noted ; 
The triangleat the light lower end of JcK is represented by a simple wedge. Both the forms of n illustrated in Butler's Chart' (V, 24. II, III,) are used. JVis formed by a distinct loop, as in the Dighwa-Dubaull plate2. The forms of -bh and s resemble those of the Fehoa Prasasti3 and are different from those used in the Gwalior inscription of BhsjaI4. 
The languageis Sanskrit ; and excepting the benedictory formula**Orfi namo VishnavS^ at the beginning, and the date and the engraver's name at the end, the inscriptionis written in verse. As Munshi Deviprasad remarks, "the language offers some serious blunders.** Thus we have dhwiam and varidaj&min v. 8, where the anusvara stands for the final n* Similar errors also occur in Y. 27. Tyajya for tyaktva, stambhya for skmibliitva, and prahatvS for prahatya occur in 11. 17 and 15, respectively. Other Instances will be noticed in their proper places ;but it,' appearsthat the write* was influenced by the idioms of the Prakrit language, which, as the Ohabiyala inscription of Kakkuka5 shows, was also used in official documents, about this period. As regards orthography we have to noticse (1) the regular use of the proper sign for the letter 6; (2) the use of upadhm&nlya before p (e.g. in vak**payadin L 1) ; (3) the doub ling of $ in placeof visarga (e.g* in yatas*=sarga in 1. 1) ; (4) the use of the guttural nasal in stead of anusv&ra before ^(e.y. in -wzrirfa" in L 2) ; (5) doublingof k and t in conjunction with, a following r (e.g. in -vikkrain&nvit&n and "bhr&ttra in L 2) ; (6) the doubling of' consonants after r (e.g. in 4argg&91. 1) ;but note the use of single v and y after- r (&$.in pfrdttJiftryatig 
in 1. 3 'and ^r-virachitam in 1. 19) ;and (7) the use of ttri for M (in JesJiattfiyS in 1L 3 and 4)\ 
The inscription records in the last five verses (27 to 31) the military exploits of a Frst!* hSra chief called Bauka and gives in vv. 4 to 26 an account of the dynasty, to "which he belonged. The eulogy of Bauka as described in the record seems to suggest that Bauka must have been away on a career of conquest when his kingdom was attacked by a confedera* cy of kings. His own partisans were unable to stand the fight and brok& into' disOKbx1,wheu B&uka suddenly appeared on the scene, rallied his men and gained a -complete vidt6ry.

Bftuka Kakkuka 
The GhatiyalS Inscriptionsof the Pratihaia Kakkuka, dated in the Vikrama year 018,* confirm the above genealogy, although in two cases the rames are slightly modified such as Sillnka for Siluka, and Bhilluka for Bhilladitya. As these inscriptions trace only the direct line of descent, they omit the names of tie three brothers of Bajjila and of the brother of Tata but add a new name to th dynastic list, mzn that of Kakkaka, the eon of Kakka and Dnrlabhadevi. Kakkuka was thus a step-brotherof Bauka. 
The foundation of th dynasty is thus ascribed to a Brahman who married two wives from two different castes. This is ?ery interesting from a social point of view.3 His sons are credited with the conquest of Ms^LcJayyapura (modem Mandor) where, as already observed the atone must hare been originally put up. The graadson of one of them fixed his capital at the city of !Ce4antaka9 which, as Munshl Deviprasad remarks, is possibly represented bythe town Herta in M&rwar4. Shortlyafter this the military ardour of the family gives way to a 
mamas Durkbh&devi and Kakkuka are taken from the Qt&atiya|i i&scriptkmg.

religious one, and tfce next king Tata spent his last days in a hermitage. His three successors seein, no doubt, to have "been powerful rulers, but his example was followed by the ,next two kings who spentthe last partof their lives on the banks of the Gauges. Kakkft, tlie successor of the last of them, is described to have fought with the peopleof B.engal (Gauda) in distant Monghyr, and the full significanceof this will be explained later on. His successor Bauka who is the hero of the inscription, defeated a king named MayOra. 
The date of the inscription has givenrise to much discussion. Manshi Deviprasad who originally edited the inscription read the figuresas 940 but Kielhorn held that there is only one numeral figure, which is 4 and read the whole as Samvat 4.1 Professor D. R. Bhandarkar8 reads the date as Sam 894. He reads the letter following Sam as vra and takes it to be a sign for 8. 
As regardsKielhorn's view I entirely agree with Professor D. R Bhandarkar that what the former reads as vva is more like vra and that the sign which he reads as t denotes the cipher for 9. There is also undoubtedly much force in the learned Professor's contention "that there can be no questionthat ma also is a sign for some integer and that it may be taken as equivalent to 8," althoughas he himself admits, vra has never been so far found to represent the integer 8. Apart from the argumentsadvanced by him, there is one consideration which is decidedly in favour of his view, and seems to me to be fatal to Munshi Deviprasad'scontention. If the date of the record be 940 Samvat, as the latter holds, Bauka must be looked upon as a younger brother and successor of Kakkuka. It is, therefore, inconceivable that his name should have been omitted from, the dynasticlist of our inscription which retains the names of collateral kinws of earlier generations. On the other hand, as Kakkuka's inscriptions do nob refer to any collateral kingat all, it cannot be a matter of surprise that Bauka's name is not mentioned therein. On the whole, therefore, I am inclined to think that Bauka was the earlier prince and that the date of the inscriptionis Samvat 894 or 837 A.D. as read by Professor Bhandarkar. 
The historical Importanceof the inscriptionis very great*It gives us a line of chiefs extending over twelve generations. Taking twenty-five ym,rs as average for each generation the total reign-periodof the dynasty would be about 300 years.3 
As the dates of Kakknka and Bauka, representingthe twelfth generationof kings, are respectively 861 and 837 A. D., Harichandra, the founder of the dynasty may be placed at about 550 A. I). The Imperial Pratlhara dynasty, however, cannot be traced back beyond the beginning of the eighth century A. D.* So far, therefore, as the available evidence goes, Harichandra must be looked upon as the earliest Pratlhara chief. The verse 5 of our iiiscrip

8 Dr. Ifoerule remarks : "The fcwo half-brothers Kakkuka and Bauka formed the twelfth get7cration of the Parihar dynasty. This fact, r.fc the usual rate of twenty yearsfor n reigti, will place Harichandra, the founder of the dynasty, at about &10 A. D." (J. R. A. S. 1906, p. tt8). Dr. Hoernle here overlooks the difference between reign aud generation. A consideration of the duration of the well known historical dynasties would show that the average duration of a generation unay he fairly taken to be at least 25 years. Thus 
(i) Eight generationsof Paia kings from Dharmapala to MaMpaia, I ruled for considerably more than 20$ years. 
(H) Seven generationsof Chalukya kings from Kirttivarmiwa I to Kirttivarmau II ruled for mor than 180 years. 
(iii) Nino generationsof Kashtrnkuta kings from Dantldnrga to IndrarSja IV ruled for more than 229 years, 
(iv) Nine $onerntions of Pratlhara lings from Yatsaraja to Trilochanapala ruled for more tbaa 344 
years. 
These give 27, 26f 25, and 257 years respectively for the averageduration of a generatxoB.

of inscriptions* of; tiiis^ dynasty which have all been fbund- within* itfe ares,1 bufcafeo fcom the express mention in the GhatiySjS Inscriptions, that/ Ka&kuka ruled over Q-arj^mtrS^ (v. 16). The inscriptional&o thrown some lightas tb the period: when this provincewas^ being: gradually occupied by the dynasty. Verses 9 a/ndf 10 tell us that the four sons- of Hari*- chandra built a huge rampart round' the fort of Mandavyapura which wa& gained "by own proivess (nija-bJiuj-&rjjite:)t Mandavyapura is evidently Mandor, the ancient capitalof war, near Jodhpur.3 It is evident* therefore, that the (Jurjams under- Harichandra and hia SODS had occupied the province^ known after them, and proceeded up to M'andbr, before the1 end of the sixth century A. D. 
The period was indeed a suitable one for such conquest. After the downfall of the HoitL lived empires of Mihirakula and Yas5dharman, northern India must have presented^ffevour-* able field for the struggleof nations.- The Gtarjaras, who probably entered India albng with 
or shortly after the Hunas, found a favourable opportunity to press forward till they advanced as far as the Jbdhpur state. Their further advance was checked by the prowess of JPrabhakara vardhana and his son,, and they were therefore obliged to establish themselves in the province which was subsequently named after them. Harichandra must have been the leader, ( or at least one of the principal leaders, of this advanced section of the Gurjaras.;in any case his dynasty was ultimately able' to establish its supremacy over tbe entire, clan. This seems to- be the only reasonable inference from the circumstances stated above, and I do not know of anyr thing which contradicts this view. 
Inscriptions testify to the existence of a line of feudatory Gurjara chiefs rulingat. Broach,* The earliest date of the third chief of'this dyua&tyis 629 A. D. Allowing fifty years fbr the two generationsthat preceded him, we get the date c. 580 A, D, for the Samanta D&dda^ who founded the line. The date correspondsso very well with that of Dadda, the youngest son of Harichandra, that the identityof the two may be at once presumed.It has-been already sag gested, on general grounds,that the Broach line was feudatory to the main line of! the Oarjaras further north,5 But no link, connectingthe two, has been hitherto obtained, The proposed identification would not only supply such a link but would also explain why the Gurjara inscriptions record that Dadda I was of the race of Qurjara King& (Gfurj^ra^nnyta^ uarrwfa) although he and his descendants are referred to as S&mantas or feudatories It further closely fits in with the theory of the Gurjara invasion dealt with above. It wouldappear that after Harichandra had carved a principality for himself in GurjaratrS and the neighbouring country, the nomadic habits of the tribe led them further south- till they conquered a fair 
portion of tSta. ^e necessityof preserving their own against the rising power of ih& Chalur fcya*r probablyled to the foundation of a feudafcory. state in the southern province under Dadda* the younger brother of the ruling king Eajjila. Instances like these are furnished by/ the history of the Ghalukyasand- the Bashtrakfttas. 
The Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang visited' a Gurjara kingdom which was about 300' miles north of Yalabhi or Suratk6 It is a noticeable fact that Grurjaratraor the country round about Mandor exactly answers to this description. As Harichandra's dynasty waff certainly rulingin th# locality at the time of the pilgrim's visit, we are justified in identifying

No. 12.] JODHPDE INSCRIPTION OF PEATIHAEA BATJKA ;V. S. 894.   
The GurjaraPratzluira line founded by Harichandra thus established itself in Rajputana and fought successfully against the royal houses of Thaneswar and BSdarai; For about two hundred yeans they mljd in splendour over the greater part of Rajputana hut the Arab invasion of about 725 A.D. brought about a decline. The Nausarl plates of the Gujarat Clialukya Pulake^iraja, dated in October, A.D. 788, tell us that the Gurjaras were destroyed by an inva sion of the Tajikas or Arabs, apparently shortly before that time.1 
It seems very likely that the Arab invasions referred to in the Nauawri plates were those undertaken by the officers of Junaid, the general of Khalif Hasham (724-743 A.D.). Biladuri gives a short account of these expeditions and mentions, among other tilings, that Junaid sent his officers to Marruacl Maxidal, Barus and other places and conquered Bailauian and Jurz.8 There can be no doubt that Marmad is the same as Marn-m,da which is referred to 111 the Ghatiyala inscriptionof Kakkuka and includes Jaisalmer and part of Jodhpnr State/5 Barns is undoubtedly1 Broach and Maudal probably denotes Mandor. It is now a well-known fact that Jurz was the Arabic corruption of Gurjara, and Bail ain an probably refers to the circle of slates mentioned in our inscriptionas Valla-manda la. It would thus appear that the Arab army under Juntil d conquered the mum Gurjara states in the north as well as the feudatory .state of Broach in the south* 
This catastrophe must have taken placeat the beginning of the second quarter of the eighth century A.D* According to Biladuri the Arab expeditions wore arranged by Junaid during the Caliphateo Hasham who ruled from 724 to 743 A.D. According to Elliot Junaid was succeeded by Tarnin abottt 726 A.I).4 Evidently this last date is far from being definitely known and we may therefore conclude that the expeditions were undertaker, shortly after 724 A.D. The Nausaii plates show, however, that the expeditions referred to in them took place -between 781 and 738 A.D. For, according to the Balsar plates,5Avanijanasraya-Pulakesi rja did not come to the throne till the year 731 A.D., and as he himself takes the credit of having repelled the Arabs from Nausarf, the event must be dated after that year. 
The Ohalukya prince Ayanijana^raya-PulakesirSja, who successfully resisted the Arabs, probably took advantage of this opportunity to wrest the Lata province from the Gurjara king dom. The decline uf the Gurjara power thus brought about by the Arab invasion in the north and the Clialukya aggression in the aonth favoured the growth of a rival Pratihura dynasty which was ultimately destined to play the imperialrftle in India, The origin of this dynasty is described in verses 4 and 7 of the Grwalior praSa&tiof Bh$ja published below. It records that N&gabhata, the first king, defeated the Mlechchhas, and after him ruled las two nephews Kakkuka and Devaraja. Vatsar&ja, the son of the latter, became a very powerful king and wrested the empire from the famous Bhandi clan. Now, our inscriptiontells us that Biluka who was tjbte protector* of Valla-ma^ala (a circle of kingdoms) defeated Bhattika Devaraja (v. 19), AB Devaraja of the Imperial Pratlhara dynasty was the father of Vatsaraja whose known date is 783-4 A.D., Le probably flourished about tlie middle of the eighth century A.D. Siluka, accordingto our scheme of chronology must also have been ruling about the same time and the identityof the two kings called Devaraja may be at once presumed* A careful study of the two inscriptions seems to show that Nagabhata, the founder of the Imperial Pratlharus, successfullyresisted the Arab invasions which proved so disastrous to the other Pratlhara line* His successors were not slow to take advantage of this favourable situation, and Ddvaraja entered into a contest for supremacy with Siluka* He was defeated by the latter.

TretS-tirtha (v. 20) and Bhuakfipa (v. 27) cannot be identified. But Ganga-dvara (v. 23) and Mudgagiri (v. 24)are well known names denoting respectively Haridvar and Monghyr.

(Verse 28). What other king bat Bauka, while his authority over other kings was destroyed, bis own younger brothers and ministers had left him and his army on all sides wasseized with terror, could, unaided, stand firm like a pillar, and, leaving the horse-back and standing on the ground unperturbed, sword in hand, pierce the enemy through and through, causing thereby a terrible burial ground in that battlefield ? 
(Verse 29). After having dispersed the recent gathering of the newly formed confedera tion, and killed Maytira, Bauka, the lion among men, killed the army which was supporting waves of swords. 
(Verse 3o). Whose mind would not now be filled with terror on remembering the house of dead made by Bauka's sword, which ere long was put in confusion bythe enemy'shost the house of dead which was made by the arms, thighs, legs and other limbs, rent in twain, with oozing as well as bloodless cavities, together with the entrails hung above, and which was full of 
jackals ? 
(Verse 31). Verily, when Bauka was dancingin the battle-field, placinghis feet on the very entrails and other partsof the dead bodies, the frightened men (enemies) who were like deer, became quiet as it were with strain tishiha, tishtha1. This indeed was very strange !

No. 13, -TEE GWALIOR PBASASTI OF THE GURJARA-PRATIHARA KING BHOJA. 
By R. 0. MAJDMDAB, M.A., PH.D.; DACCA. 
The stone which bears this inscription was discovered in 1896, about half a mile west of Gwalior town, at Sagar Tal in the Gird-Gwalior district. It contains 17 lines of writing cohering a spaceof about 3' 4|" broad by 1' 2" high. The first twelve lines are incised with great care and neatness and the letters are so distinct and beautiful that they can be read without hesitation even from a distance. The remaining lines, for some unaccountable reasons 
are not so distinctly engraved, but can be read, without any great difficulty, especially from the reverse side of the estampage. . The whole inscription is thus .clearly legible except two letters at the end of line 5 where the stone surface is damaged. 
It was first edited by Pandit Hirananda in the Arch. Surv. Report for 1903-4 (pp 277-285), with a facsimile Plate. Then, in March 1905 Dr. Kielbora gave a ghort account of the inscription in Nacliric.Mm von dor Koniglidien Oeselkchafi dsr Wittentchaften ai Qot ttngen (pp. 300-304) without any reference to the first edition. I re-edit the inscription from fresh impressions kindly procured for me by Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar, M.A. My exotue in taking up. the subject again, is that, in my opinion, the great historical importance of the record requires further scrutiny and comment. I follow the previous Editors as" far as posaible but give my independent opinion only in cases where I feol it necessary to do so. The language of the inscription is Sanskrit, and exceptthe benedictory formula oA nam VuTwve at the beginning,it is throughout composed in metrical form. The author nhowg himself to be well versed in the best form of tho Kavya stylo, and kin ohiwto digniBod TOM*make one sincerely regret that no further production from lu able pen ha been preserved for whicli

Of these, NSgabhafa I defeated a Mlechctilia army (v. 4), and DevarSja is said to hare defeated a host of tings (v. 5). His son "Vatsar&ja, a famous king, forcibly wrested the 
empire from the BhaiHii clan (vv. 6-7) and Nagatohata Hdefeated C&akrayttdha and also con quered kings of the Anartta* Turushka* MSlava9 !Tatsaf Matsya and other countries (TV. 8-11). BIx5ja also called Mihira, is said to have defeated Ms powerful enemies and verses 16-26 describe his greatnessin general terms. 
The chronology of the kings mentioned in this inscription may be fixed with a tolerable degree of certainty. We have the dates 756-7 AJX for Nagabhata I, 783-4 A.D.J for Vatsaraja, 815 A.D. for Kagabhata II, and dates ranging from 843 to 881 A.D. for Bhdja. Again, welearn from a Jaina book, the PrabhavaJca-cJiarita, that king NSgSvaloka of Knyakubja, the grand-father of Bhoja died in 890 Vikrama-Samvat, and this NSgavalOka ha* been dorre^tly identified with Nagabh&Ca H.i Thus the first three kings of the genealogical table fpay be placed between 725 and 775 A.D., and the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh kings may be taken to have ascended the throne respectivelyat about 775, 800, 833 and 840 A.D. 
Before the discovery of this inscription, our knowledge of the Gurjara-Pratlhra kings, whoplayed such an important part in Indian history, was very limited and inaccurate. Although the late A. M. T. Jackson, M.A., I.C.S., and Prof. Bhandarkar^ laid the true foundation of our knowledge about the Gurjara-Pratlh&ra history, a complete understanding of the subject, in all its bearings, was impossible, in consequence of the view held by Dr, Fleet, Dr. Kielhora and others, that the homonymous kings referred to in the copper-plateslived earlier than, and were thus different from, those mentioned in the stone inscriptions. It was the discovery of this inscription that finally settled the question and facilitated the proper treatment of the Q-urjara Pratlhara history.8 Dr. V. A. Smith has clearly pointed out,* that the express mention of the family name of the kings in this inscription helps us to definitely assign the royal dynasty of Kanauj to the Grurjara-Pratlhira clan. 
The rise and growth of the great Gurjara empire, which played such a conspicuous part in Indian polity in the ninth century AJX, is clearly traced by our inscription. The names of the early kings of the dynasty, recorded in inscriptions, such as the Daulatpura copper-plate of BhOjadSva,5 Dighwi Dubauli plate of MahSndrapSla6 and the Bengal Asiatic Society's copper 
plate of Vin&yakapala7 are but a mere string of names without any details such as are to be found in the present inscription. This invests our record with particular importance, and the data it furnishes may be justly said to have revealed an altogether new chapterof Indian history. 
The founder of the royal line is named Hagatohata, a name not yet found in any other record of the family. He is said to have defeated the MlScTichha army, and the manner in which this solitary fact is mentioned with regard to hitsij seems to show that it was looked upon

as of great importancein the historyof the family. Now the locality of 
and the period when he flourished may be gathered from a piwwigishi th Jaina The passage has been noticed by various scholars, and the .following reawrku of Dr. Fleet aav be taken to represent the earlier views regardingits interpretation.* A pattwkg in the J| Earivaihta of Jinasgna tells us that that work was finished in &aka- Ruthvat 705 784 A.D., when there were reignin^-in various directions dntormtned with town named Vardharoanapura, which a to be identified with modern WnghwAp m th division of Kathiawar, in the north, IndrSyudha; in the mrntfa, 6rttliabha in th Vatsaraja, kingof Avanti (Ujjain) ; and in the wett, Vai-Ehft or Jyawr|Ii f i '& the Sauryas."^ This seems to have been the accepted view till 1002 wtum Prof. D E darkar gave a somewhat different interpretation of it. He tnumtfttod tfei hit' follows :- In the east, the illustrious king of Avanti;m the wit Mg 7*1^1*1 the tenitory of the Sanryas, the victorious nd bntve VwAb*."* Quito rw% Pnrf D Bhandarkar hs drawn my attention to a passage m u possession*, which runs as follows :

incursions against TJjjain, and if we remember that this is from the pen of an Arab historian, it must be looked uponas a tacit admission that the Arabs failed in their expedition against Ujiain. It is also significant, that the Nausarl plates1 do not include the king of Avantl in the list of those that were defeated by the Arabs. Further, Biladuri himself admits that Junaid's successor was feeble, and, in his days, the Miisnlmans retted from several partsof India and left some of their possessions. 
Thus all the available evidence shows tbat Nagabhata I established the greatnessof his family by his triumphant success over the Arabs." The Hns5t platesof the Chabamana feudatory Bhartrivatjdlha II3 records a grantthat was made at Broach, in the increasing reign of victory of the glorious NSgavaldka, in the year 756 A.D. Prof. D. E. Bhandarkar3 upheldtha view that this NagavalOka is no other than Nagabhata I, and Dr. Sten Konow* has acceptedit. It would then follow that he re-established the Pratlhara sovereigntyover Broach which the family of Jodhpur must have lost during the Arab expeditions, A reminiscence of Naga bhata's struggle with the neighbouring powers seems to .have been preservedin the Ragholi plates of Jayavardhana II, a king of the Saila dynasty, ruling over part of the Central Pro vinces. We are told that Ppithuvar,dhana3 a king of the family, who probablyruled about the middle of the eighth century AJX, conquered the country of the Qurjaras.5 
We have seen above, in connection with the Jodhpur inscription of the Pratlhara Bauka, how, as an indirect result of the Jflechohha invasion, the suzeraintyhitherto enjoyed by the dynasty of Harichandra passedinto the family of Nagabhata. It would appearthat shortly after 725 A.D., when the Arab invaders seemed to have carried away everything before themt and, in particular, defeated the Pratlhara clan who had been rulingin Rajputana for about two centuries, Nagabhata gained successes over the Mlechchha forces and established his supremacy over the clan. The struggle which thus began between the two Pratlhara families was long and tedious. &iluka, the king of the Eajputana family, succeeded in regaining hia territory after defeating one Devaraja, probablythe nephew of Nagabhata I. Vatsaraja, the son and successor of Dertiraja, however, continued the struggle and gave the final blow to the totter ing rival power. The empire over which it had ruled for well-nigh two hundred years then finally passedinto the hands of the family of Nagabhata* 
The data furnished by onr inscription, supplemented by a few other known facts, enable ua to sketch a brief history of the empire tbat was thus founded by Vatsaraja. Verses 6 and 7 describe his mighty prowess and splendour, and mention, inlparticfular, that he had subdued the whole world. This statement, allowing for the natural exaggerationof the Prasasti writers, cannot be said to be altogether inaccurate, inasmuch as it is prettycertain that Vatsaraja had conquered the lord of Gau4& and was thus probably master of by far the greater p&rtof Northern India. This state of prosperity, however, did not continue long. The Biahtrafcuta king Dhruva inflicted a crushing defeat upon him, overran his territoryas far as the Gaugea

III1 and one inscription specifically refers to the defeat inflicted upon K&gabliata Tbytiie same king, and Ms triumphant march to the Himalayas2, It would thus appear that the Gurjara empire so laboriouslyrebuilt by Nagabhat-aII once more fell beneath the crushing blows of the hereditaryfoes of Ms family. There are reasons to believe that this was broughtabout by a confederacy between the two chief enemies of the Ghirjaras,vis. the Palas of Bengal and the B>Sshtrakt|jas of the south. For the same inscription that records the defeat of Fagabhata II in the hands of G5vinda III also mentions the fact that DharrnapSla and Chakrayudha visited or submitted to the last named king of their own accord8. 
The victoryof the Bashtrakutas, although by no means final and decisive, was no doubt disastrous to the Gurjaras. The provinceof Malwa passed into the hands of the Eashtrakuta, and Andhra, Vidarbha and Kalinga also possibly shared the same fate. The Pratlharas, however, did not cease to give trouble to the Eashtraktitas, for we are told in the inscription of the feudatory chief Karkaraja of Gujarat,that the Eashtrakuta king had"caused his arm to become an excellent door-bar of the country of the lord of the Gurjaras."4 
But ere long the political situation changed. The Eashtrakutas themselves were torn asunder by internal dissensions, Karkar&jaof Lata, the son and successor of IndrarSja, was expelled by his youngerbrother in 812 A.D., and what was worse still, the revolutionary movement, thus set on foot, afterwards developed into an attempt to prevent the accession of AmdghavarshaI.5 
This unexpected embroglioin the EUshtraktita affairs left the Palas and the Gurjaraa free to fight among themselves. It appearsthat NSgabha^a retained his hold upon Kanauj 
1 Cfa Rodhanpur plates,v, 15 (above, Vol. VI, p. 244), and the NUgund ins., v. 5 (ibid, p. 102). Two passages in the Baroda plates of Karkaraja also seem to refer to the conflict between Nagabhata and the Bashtra. k-utafl. Thus it is said with reference to Isdraraja, the "brother of Govinda III, and the founder of the Gujarat branch o the BashtraMtas ;

I& Ant.t Vol. XII, p. 160. 
As it is explicitly stated that, Indraraja was placed on the throne of Lata by Govrada III, this defeat of the Gtnnaras must have taken place during his reign.It was thus different from the expedition undertaken by Dhruva against Vatsaraja* and the word SMnos, distinguishesit from the campaign of Govinda III referred to in the Badhanpnr plate or the Nllgxmd inscription. Thai the opponent of Indraraja was most likely Nagabhata himself who is represented in the above passageas enteringinto some alliance, protectiveor defensive, if not offensive, with the mc^ammant^ of tbe south against Govinda III and actually preparedfor war (cf. Fleet's remarks, Hid, p. 158). This ftilly confirms what I have suggested above on the strengthof the eighth verse of our inscription, The other passagerefers to KarkarSjaas follows :*

fir. V. A. Smith identified theff< Lord of Gurjaras*' in the above passage with Vatsaraja (J, JB. A*$,t 1909, p 252). But thi$ is untenable. As Govinda died about 814 A.D., it must be maintained that the Gurjara chief against whom he employoA bis nephew in 812-3 A, D. could not be any other than Nagabhata who is specifically 
mentioned a being defeated by him (see 1 n* 2 below). As Nagabhata defeated Vangapati,the phrase** Gaud-endra **m%ht well apply to hiBij and the Buchkala inscription (above, Yol, IX. p,

No. 14. PATTATTALMANGALAM GRANT OF NANDIVARMAN. BY K. V. SUBBAHMANYA AlYER, B.A., OoTACAMUNB. 
In October 1922, when I was in charge of the office of the Assistant Archaeological Superin tendent for Epigraphy, Madras, Mr. P. V. Jagadisa Aiyar obtained the following set of copper plates from Mr. Em. St. Sivananda Pillai of Kumbakonam and sent it to me for examination, As I had soon after to go away to Ootacamund, I left the plates to be noticed by Mr. Venkoba Rao in the Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1922-23. The set is marked as No. 5 Appendix A in the Report for that year and finds a short notice in Part II which will be referred to in the sequel. I edit the inscription on the plates with the help of one set of impressions kindly placed at my disposal by M. R. Ry. Rao Bahadur H. Krishna Sastri. Recently an article entitled"the Kot. rangudi platesof Nandivarman II"has appeared in thp Mythic Society Journal, Vol. XIV, pp. 125 to 129, under the editorshipof Mr, T, N. Subramaniam. There the discoveryof the plates has been described in detail, 
The set consists of five plates of which the first and last are engraved only on their inner sides. They were originally strung together on a ring bearing a massive seal, 3 inches in diameter. The emblems and legend on the seal are so badly obliterated that they cannot be made out. A cou chant ifoull is all that could be faintly seen. The ring had been cut when the plates reached me and it is not known when and by whom it was cut. The plates measure nearly 10* by 3|* and the ring-hole, b'ored at the left margin, is f*in diameter. The five plates with the ring and seal weigh 320 tolas and the plates alone weigh 175 tolas. 
The inscription on the platesis neatly executed and is in good preservation. The only places where some damage is done to letters are at the commencement of lines 7 and 8 of 116, lines 1 and 2 of Ilia, lines 5 and 6 of III6 and line 8 of IV6. It has been found possible to restore with certainty all the damaged portions exceptthat in line 1 of Ilia. The reading of the damaged portion in line 6 of III6 is tentative. As is usual with most of. the copper-plate charters of South India, this inscription consists of two parts of which the first is in Sanskrit poetry (eleven verses in all) written in <3xaut1ia characters and runs from line 1 -to line 22, where the second part in Tamil prose commences and runs to the end i.e., line 60. The few Grantha letters and words employed in the Tamil portion are sama, sarmw-pariharam and brahmade (L 37), haram (L 38), brahmade ( 1. 42), gauta (11. 43 and 45), #y* and Jcra (1. 43), bhatta (11. 44 and 45), jatva (1. 44), Hira^ya (11. 44 and 48), Agni&armma and gdtra (L 47), de (L 48), armma (II 45, -53, 56, 57, and 58) and &i-JDo#$ (i. 60). 
A few alphabetical peculiarities deserve notice : The symbol for secondary? (long)is a con cave curve with a commencing loop engraved on the top of the consonant, while in the case of i (short), this loop is absent. The three letters mu, pu and lu are almost similar in shape, but can be well distinguished on close examination : while the u symbol of mu is written Immediately below the horizontal line, it is engraved at the end of a vertical downward stroke drawn from the right end of the horizontal in the case of pu* Though lu is formed like pu, it 
is distinguished by having a small indenture at the right end of the horizontal stroke. Two forms of ya occur of which one is a semi-circle with two upward arms on the right side, white 
the other is a simple loop twice wound round. The shapeof w is almost that of a triangle with its base at bottom. La has not got the usual convex curve on the right aide ; it has only an angle. The rlpha*is invariably marked in this epigraph and in most gases the pulli also* 
The Tamil tandfoi rules have to account for the change o< I into y in p&r&r-lmJima, (I 42). But it m^y be pointed out that the same change noticed in the word vity^appattSv occixrring" before JLlapp&kJca (L 27), in valiyar occurring before ma#at (1. 31) and in

states that it must belongto the reignof Nandivarman III. I consider this conclusion of Msto be quite untenable. I would at the outset point out that the Taij.dantottam plates which are supposed to have been issued in the reignof NandiVarman III should correctly be attributed to his grandfather Nandivarman II Pallavamalla. According to the Ta^dantottam plates the king bore the surname Ekadhira1 and this was the surname of Nandivarman Pallavamalla as is clear from the fact that the grant made in the Ka^akudi plates was constituted into a new village under the name Ekadhiramangalam2 which should have been so termed after the king's surname Ekadhlra. The second pointto note is that the Nandivarman of our plates was the successor of Hiranyavarman as was the Nandivarman. of the Ka6akudi and the Tandantottam plates. The third ground, which is much stronger than all, is furnished in the Vaiku^tha Perumal temple inscriptions3explaining the sculptures representing the events that took place immediately after the death of Parame6varavarman II leadingto the accession of andivar man Pallavamalla. It says : 
After the death of ParameSvaravarman II, a deputation consistingof the Matras, the Mulaprakritis ^ndtheghatakayar waited on Hira^tyavarma-Maliaraja and represented the fact that the country was without a ruler and requested him to grant them a sovereign. Thereupon king Hiranyavarman sent for the chief potentates (Jculamallar) and enquired which among them would accept the sovereignty.All of them refusing, he asked his sons Somalia, Raxiamalla, Saigrarnamalla and Pallavamalla. Pallavamalla humbly offered to go, but king Hiraiiyavarman was at first unwillingto risk his son, who was then only twelve yearsof age,in such a perilous undertaking. But Hiranyavarman was soon persuaded by Daranikoaju^apS&ar to givehis consent. Receivingthe weapons presented to him both by his father and DaraiTiikoaidapo^ar, Pallavamalla proceededto KSficMpuram, crossing on his way several hills, rivers and forests. Hearing of his approach a certain Pallavadi-Araiyar came* with a large force, and placed him on an elephant's back and returned to the city where he was received by the feudatory chiefs, the memfbers of the merchants* guild, the mulaprakritis, and KS^akka-Miittaraiyar. He was then crowned king under the name Nandivarman and with the insigniaof VidLelvi^ugu, Samudraghdsha, Khatvanga-dhwja and Vrtshabha-lMchhana by the ministers, the feudatories^ the ghatakayar and the ubJiaiya-gana. 
The above facts show that Nandivarman Pallavamalla's accession to the throne took place without any bloodshed, the whole country being instrumental in getting him as their sovereign. Thds fact does also find expressionin the KaSaku^i plates which state that he Was chosen by the subjects.4 The statement that Nandivarman was quite young (i.e., 12 yearsof age according to the Vaiku^tha-Perumal temple inscription) when he became the ruler of the Pallava dominions is correctly reflected in the present grant wldch states of him *rnr*T Trftraft *p*f W*A further pointin favour of our view is that Nandivarman Pallavamalla bore the surname

The objectof the inscription is, as stated already,to register the grantof certain lands in the vicinityof a village situated in JLrvala-ku;;am, a sub-division oi &5}a-n&}u, constituted into a new village under the name Pattattalmangalamto a number of Biahmans who are introduced by the collective term ^algw-narpappar.It is worthy of mote that in the Tagdantofitam plates also, the donees are similarly styled.1 Two possible modes of interpreting the term nafyw-naf papparhavebeen given by Mr. Krishna Sastri*viz.,"the good Brahmins of Nalgfir"and"the poor good Brahmins.5 'Since in two instances the donees have been so styled,it, does pot scorn probable that Nalgiir means a village of that name* Accordingly, we m^y adopt the second interpretation- The grant must have been made on their request which was conveyed to the king by the chief of Mangala-nau,. and this is perhapsclear from the Sanskrit portion which, tat eg fqwpft ^Hra 3ff ~^F|*If Nalgiir were a village,it might have been mentioned in the Sanskrit por tion also. It is to be noted that most of the donees were highly learned men being Kramavits, Sha<Jan.gavits and Trivedins. Since the villages in JLrvala-kuggam are- mostly fount! in the Negapatam taluk of the Tanjore district, we have to look for PattattaJmOiiagalaimin that same 
taluk. Arvalam is at presentcalled 'Alivalam. AlambSkkaxa, of which VijayanalluJlaR was a native, has already been identified by me with the villageof th$t name in tfaa Triohinopoly District, 12 miles from LalgudU op. the road to Ariyalur.3Mangala-n&d,ii was a sub-division of Arumolideva-valanadu and in it was situated the villageof Mafigalam now called Mangah* It is needless to saythat Kachchippedu mentioned in the record is identical with Conjeoveram and Aimpanaichcheriia Aimbuijaichcheri,, a quarter of it. 
We may here add a short note on some of the important words occurring in this inscription. As"ami"means**to beat"and"olai" "a (written) palm-leaf," we may take the compound "apaiy-tila'?* (1.32)4to meanC the draft whose contents had to be proclaimed by beat of tom-tom," Tirumugam (L 33 f .) is only the Tamil form of the Sanskrit word irimuMtwcca sacred order, a royal writ." Kottagdram (L 35) seems to be the Tamil adaptation of the Sanskrit gfohthH grihaua cow- pen, kraal"it is sometimes? employed in the seme of a king's residence, palace. Jfaarti (L 38) k a wonl which is largely met with in Tamil inscriptions e.g., mawrupa$u> ma$rum kanrum$y*patum> etc, As such, its meaning deserves to be noted. In Puyam 34, occurs the phrase iraiti-niftiya ayan-falai* manram which, According to the commentator, means"the extensively spacious common grouud (podiyil) with the long iratti tree standing 6n it.'* Marippalavin"in the jack-tree standing on the common ground (podiyil)"occurs in Puram 128. 
; Again, we meet with thi* word in the 
phrase pMai-mudur~manran~1eande in Puram 220, In all these cases, the commentator takes the word manru or marram in the sense of"a common meeting groundn(podwifam m. podiyil), A distinction is, however, made between ^podiyil and manram in Tirumiirogarruppaijai, one of the ten Tamil idylls known as Pattuppattu.* N^chchinarkkigiyar takes the word fadiyil to m^n an af^aZam,~which, by the way, we may WDM*:, is am)t^er tepn used in iworiptioiw and tlia word manmm he explainsas"the space under a tatee in the uoiddle of yiJHg^ wl^eye' ftll pooplo meet (QruKhu na$uv8y~ellarum imMum mmtta$i).n JVom the veferenoea quoted low*, it will be plain that manram refers to the place where the village assembly met to tmnsaot ito bufiinoHg and that this was under a (big) tree (which afioided them shade), Epigmphical are not wanting to support the fact that in the assembly grounds th^m wew ferejs and that '^wmmm& had been ma4e to have them washed and swept clean.

as stated already, and it Is after thia title that the father of tW vn^mver of the grant must have been called Videlvldugu-Pallava-perunaaehchaih1 
It fc noteworthythat the Sjftapti of our inscription, vt., Xlappak'bi (AlambSkka)' Vijaiyanaflulaft figuresin an inscriptionof Pallaratilaka-NamHvnrman found at Tinivdlarai in the Trichinopoly district.* This chiefs younger brother, Kambau Araiyan hy nmnf\ figure* as the constructor of a bigwell in the same placeas recorded in an wcription of 'Pniliivaiilaka^Oanti* vatnian.3 It is now beyond question from the prcwnt grant that tfnw kin/** Pnllavat-iluka'Nandi* varman and Pallavatilaka-Dantivarman, in "whone inHmption fij;nrtk the two brothers Vijayanallulaii and Kamban.

Thus it become clour thai. fh*> t*rm raltnwtihtka was not the surname of any particular kingof the Palluva line whirh WIIH lalr on tulopted as a title by his successors. In editing the*Tiruveflajai well inscription4 I waa inrlim*d f o follow the late Mr. Venkayyain considering the successors of Dantivurman a tH^tHigSHg to th^ family of Pallavatilaka, that being almost the special designation then known to hr* uf Dantivurman as indicated in the Triplioane inscriptionof that king.5 The pmsent grant ht>W8 that clmrtor* writers did not mean anydistinction between Pallamkula and Pallw&atilttkrtkittu. lli^nvfon^ in case we meet with inscriptionsof Nandivarman or Dantivarman with the word PniluviiUhika or Pallava tilakakula prefixedto their names, we have to distinguish the king from tlum** who lx>re wimilar names, by other evidences than what is furnished by the mere title Puthnwtitaktt. In this connection, it may be pointed out that A^iga} Qarjicjarj Mft^ambfivai, who figum* a donor in a record of the early Cho}a king EajakSsarivarman (Aditya 1) and who in Htntwi to h< the queen of Pallavatilaka-Nandivarman6,cannot be the queen of Pallavamalla, for Idilyn I mid Hallava malla, are sepa ated by over a century; in all probabilityli iniii linvi* bwn t.hw queen of Pal'avamalla's grandsjgp Nandivarman III. 
As has been noted, the present inscriptionis dated in thn flint yi*ar of th kiri^n reign, In my Historical Sketches7,I gave my consideration to the quotum win*iti!T or not Nandi varman Pallavamalla could have reigned for a long tim, unurpisr m ho WIIH than known to be, and taking only into view the several conquests he effected and thu tiruo of riil^ of hm contem poraries, I arrived at the conclusion that he should be credited with a king puriodlolarule. Thin conclusion is now made certain by a study of the Vaikuatfm-Pwuttijtl Uboi cpigmph and the present copper-plate grant according to both of which the princw wn* qwitw' young />. 12 years of age, when he became king and by the fact of the prenent wwsripfcion tunng dated in the 61st year.

U.J PATTATTALMANGALAM GRANT OF NANDIVARMAN.   
'(Verse 1). Hail ! Prosperity ! Let that :body of the husband of $n ,(ie., Vishnu), which is resplendent with the Jcaustubha jewel on its chest and which with a hundred mar&Tc&ta-llk arms is lying on the ocean, resembling a collection of clouds lustrous with -the interspersed lightning and settling on the waters of the ocean to imbibe (its) water, grant you welfare. 
(V. 2), That which is the highest place of salvation, is immutable, is omnipresent, is con templated on by yogis and that which the Brahmans excessivelyextol always with firm wisdom and with the chanting of the Vedas, which though itself undivided, assumes three differentiations 'by adopting the three qualities in order to accomplish (the work of) protection, destruction and creation may that all-pervading object protect you. 
(V. 3). From the navel-lotus of Narakari (i.e. Vishnu) was born Brahma;from him was (born) Angiras ;from him Devaguru (i.e., Brihaspati) ; from him (came) Samyu the best of sages ; from his son Bharadvaja (was born) Drojja who was renowned as an archer in the battle-field ; from him, (came) Drauiji (i.e., A^vatthaman) who was of irresistable great power, and from him came Pall&va, 
(V. 4). Lakshmi and the Goddess of Earth having attained the status of consorts to the -kings of this family they could not be appropriated by the assemblage of (other) kings. (Vv. 5 and 6). In this dynasty of kings, whose family vow was the accumulation of fame by giving largesses to suitors after having made the wealth their own by conquering all enemy kings^ after the illustrious Vlrakftrcfaa and others had gone to Heaven after having enjoyed the sea-girt earth for a long time, there came $Wr^yavar:oqi$;p, the foremost of rulers and then Nandi varman, whose gloriousfeet were rubbed against by the diadems of all kings. (V. 7). This king of renowned prowess, whose foot-stool was the. crown of prostrate kings, ruled his,kiiigd,om,0v0jDL'"wMle yqnpg, after having killed his enemies and conquered the king dom single-handed'With his unsheathed sword scintilatingin his hand. 
(v. 8)- The* entire world was rid of its darkness by * his fame with ^hich all the quarters were whitened; arid the sun and the moon were (only) useful for awakening (i.e. 9 opening) the lotus and lily ponds respectively. 
(V. 9), At his gatethere await without (getting) opportunity (to enter) the Vallabh.as ? the KalaMiras, the KeraJ^s, the PajjwJ.yas, the Ch6J.as, the Tulus, the Ko&ka^as and others desirous of obtaining admission to serve (him). 
(V. 10). The servant of this '(king) ,who was the storehouse of austerities and virtue, who was. heroic, highly distinguished, . respected by the good, whose wealth was honour, whose spread ing fame envelopedthe interior of all the quarters, and in whom, who was the relative of the world, the name MaAgalar50htra-bhartyi (the lord of the district called Mafigala-rashtra) became -wdl-kaown, gave to a concourse of Brahmans (their) desired object, having repeatedly 
petitioned; b,e ,kwg- 
(V. 11). May this gift of the ruler of the country of Ma&gala, the ..subordinate of the Pal* lava Idngj^ta^jd^alo^asthe Earth, the Ocean, the Moon .and the Sun (exist). (LL 22 to 32). In tfce sixty-first year of (the reign of) king Vijaiya^Nandivikrama varman, the following order to the residents (of Arvala-kujjam) was issued at the request of ^t the oompaa&d (atyatti) of IjTijaiyapalMlan of t Alappals;am :

No. 15, BOCK INSCRIPTION OF STAMIBHATA FROM DEQGARBL 125   
No. 15. DEOGARH ROCK INSCRIPTION OF SVAMIBHATA. BY DATA RAM SAHNI, RAI BAHADUB, M.A. 
The antiquities of Deogarfa. situated about 22 miles from Lalitpurin tlie district of Jhausi are described in Drf Fiihrer's Monumental Antiquities and Inscriptionsin the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, pp. 119-121 and 333, Mr. P, 0. Mukherjee's Report on the Antiquities in the District of Lalitpur and General Cunningham's Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. 2t, 
pp. 100-110. The ancient fort at Deogarh is designated Luachchhagira in the Deogarh pillar inscription of Bh5]adeva of Kanauj, Vik. Samvat 9191 while the Deogarh rock inscription of Kirtivarmaa of the [Vik.] year 1154 givesit the name of KirttigiriL2 
This inscriptionis engraved on a much-worn rock-cut flight of steps which led down on the south side of the Deogarh Fort to the water of the river BetwS, which encloses it on three sides. This flight of stepsis locally known as the Nahar or Nar Ghat! and possesses as many as eleven niches all contemporaneous with the Gh5t some of which still contain their images. The panel occurring at the topof the Ghat, with which we are here concerned, contains a row of nine seated figures which represent, beginning from the left : (1) A male figure holding a 111& between both hands, probably Vlrabhacba, (2) Brahtnl with three faces, (3) M&h8vari seated on a lion and holding Ga^eSa in her left hand, (4) KaumSri on her peacock^ (5) Vaishnavl on the Garu<Ja> (6) VgraM, (7) Indra^tf* (8) four-armed Chamu^a, seated oil a human corpse and (d) two-armed Ganapati. 
The inscription under descriptionis engraved immediately above this panel of the divine Mothers. The inscribed surface is 1' 11" wide and 1' 1" in. height. The inscription consists of seven lines and is in a fairly goodcondition of preservation though six letters in the begin ning of the first line and a few letters in the beginningof each of lines 5 7 are mutilated. The characters which belong to what Dr. Buhler styles the*< acute-angled alphabetMof Northern India, are closelyallied to the alphabetin which the Bddh-Gaya inscription of Mahanaman of the Gupta year 269s,the Prafasti41 of the templeof Lakha Marwjal at Madiha in Jaunear Bawar Farganaof the Dehra Dun District, the Benares inscription of Pantha6 and several other documents are written. The striking peculiarities of this alphabet are the highly ornamental kdnas and m&trSs and these are fully shared by the epigraph under discus sion. Dr. Buhler assigns the Lakha Ma$4&l praiasti^to about the end of the 6th century A.D, In my paper on the Benares inscription of Pantha referred to above I assigned that 
document erroneouslyto the beginningof the 8th century AJD, In realityit must be as early as the other inscriptions referred to. This is obvious, besides other considerations, from the use of the archaic form of y consistingof the loop and two vertical lines. This form of y is also used throughout in the present inscription, and I feel no hesitation in assigningit to the 8th century A.D, The language of the document is Sanskrit and except for the opening words 6m namafy at the beginningof line 1, the inscriptionis in verse throughout. In the matter of spelling 
and sandhi, only one or two irregalarities are observable in our inscription. One of these is the use of frdptdn***trida4ainstead of prdptdms*tridaain line 5. Similarly although the doubling of consonants in contact with r after vowels is quite regular, ihe form JcJcramSgata (1. 4) in the beginning df the third quarterof v. 4 is objectionable,as the consonant Jc concerned

m. 16.-A KALACHTJRI STONE INSCBIFTIOH FROM KASIA, Br DATA KAM SAHNI, EAI BAHADUR, ALA. 
The stone slab on which this inscriptionis engraved, was dfcoovereti by Mr. A, C* L. in 1875-76 at the Buddhist ruins near Kasia which has since been proved by nucxmuwr* tions to representin all probability the ancient site of Kulimagam whero Gautama Buddha, breathed his last or entered Mahaparin%rv$na* The exaofc pot whi ihifl ducovary wm made was on the south side of the door- way of the brick shrine in which the large hlatikobom imnge ol 
the Buddha at the moment of Ms enlightenment, locally known M the M&th& Klart wm ly enshrined. This shrine turns out to be the chapel of a monastery of the 1 1th or 12fch A.D,/ and not an independenti templeas Mr, Carlleyla piwumsbly ixnaginacl. Thin WAS excavated by Pt. Hirananda Sastri in 1911 and 1912.* An the innoriptioa which forma the subject of this paper, was found in this monument, it neem* to me likely that doemniTOfe recorded its erection. The loss of the latter portion of the inscriptionto be rafernd 'to later on is, therefore, much to be regretted. 
The slab is the blue stone of GayS of the same kind an thm tutorial ol Hit statue, referred to above and must, likewise, have been brought fount that District and and set up in the building where it has been recovered.

the first 29 stanzas indicating the metre of each, and the number of the line of the inscription in which each verse ends or would have ended had the document been better preserved. As to the metres of these stanzas, I agreeto Professor Kielhorn's list, exceptin regard to the 28th verse, "where he doubtfully makes the metre Vamtiattha, though it is more probablyMaths-* 
ddhat&ythe space being just enough for 44 syllables and the scheme of the extant last pada a& read by me being that of the Eathdddhata metre. 
In respectof its contents the document is divisible into three portions, namely, (1) the invocations of deities (vv. 1-5), (2) the mythical and legendary portionof the genealogy (vv. 6-12), and (3) the historical portion. In connection with verses 4 and 5 it is interesting to observe that the two Hand! verses of the Buddhist drama, the"Nagananda ", also invoke the Buddha under the epithets of Jina and Munindra, the appellationsin our inscription being TatJiagata and Hunzndra, In connection with the second section, it Js to be observed that in v. 8 the marriage of Budha with IIS, the daughter of Manu, is also mentioned though it is over looked in Prof* Kielhorn's resume. It is also noteworthy that while the Kahla plate inscription of SodlhadSva1 of another branch of the Kalachuri dynasty mentions Kritavlrya after Haihaya the Harivamsa has as many as seven kings between Haihaya and Kritavtrya.* The names of these seven kings are (1) Dharman^tra, (2) Kartta, (3) Sahanja, (4) Mahishman, (5) BhadraSrSnya, (6) Durddama and (?) Kanaka* 
The historical portionof the genealogy begins with'v, 18 and embraces the rest of the preserved portion of the document. The founder of the branch of the Kalachturl dynasty represented by the present epigraph was Saiikaragana as was Lakshma^a-rfija of the other branch referred to in the preceding paragraph. My text of the Kasia inscription elucidates twoor three obscure pointsin the summary of Prof. Kielhorn, and furnishes the names of one or two other kings which are omitted by him. In the first place Prof. Kielhom was doubtful about the relationship of the third king Lakshmana (I) (v. 16) to his predecessor Ifannarlja. My reading of the verse clearly makes him a son of Nanna-raja. The same remark applies to the next king Siva-r&ja (I) (v. 18) who must have been a son to Lakshmana (I)* Again Prof. Kielhorn's summary makes Bajaputra (v- 20) the son of Bhimata (I) mentioned in v. 19. It now appears that the term rGjaputra is only a title of Lakshmana (II) aiot mentioned in Prof. Kielhorn'a jiotes, who was in all probability the son of Bhunafca. The last Icing* (v. 27) mentioned in the extant portion of the record is Bhimata (II), son of Kanehana probably the wife of LakshmaiaarSja II or of another king whose name may have disappeared in Y, 26- It is impossible^to ascertain whether the inscription was set up in the time of this prince (Bhimata II) or whether the missing portion contained the names of one or more other princes, Nor la it possible, for the same reason, to say what the object of the inscription was. 
The only place mentioned in the epigraphis Saivaya8(verse 17) to which Lakahmaga resorted after having entered a fort whose name is missing. The verse mentioned above describes it as a mountainous district (tiikhari-vishayath) which was the residence of Sifoi the son of TTsmara. Prof. Kielhorn proposed to identify this locality with Seweya, situated a few miles south or south-east of Kasia. I have nothing to say againat this suggestion, for the place must have been situated somewhere in the vicinity of Kasia where the inscription has been found, though it must be observed that the village Seweya, which I personally mnpected, is situated on perfectly level ground and not iu a mountainous region- In an interesting article on the 8horJcot inscription of the year 83* Dr. Togel has discussed the history of the jSibi tribe

Om ! Salutation to tlie Self-controlled,1 salutation to the Buddha ! 
Verse 1. May the eternal vision of Siva, who destroys the threefold2 fear of (mundane) exist ence, protect (us or you,the vision) which is subtle and unique^ which is luminous after having cut asunder the knot of dense and extensive darkness by the sword of knowledge which is hostile to the assembly of the entire multitude of all the sense-organs ; which shines in various super- human aspects such a$ the manifest, etc., and which gladdens* .......... 
V, 2* May Sarikara defend you for a long time, (Sankara) who is engaged in coaxing entreaties befitting the occasion on seeing Pa-rvatl averse (to him) on account of anger through jealousy due to his salutation to Sandhya \ (and) who (Sankara) at that very moment obtains the pleasure of a violent embrace (given) by her (Parvatl) frightened (by the Kailasa mountain being lifted up) by the two migVty arms of Ravana).3 
V. 8, May Tara, the mistress of the three worlds, extend enjoyments to youf (Tara) who bears her body ,(wMch is Beautified) by the law of the Buddha in this way : (her) form (is) an embodiment of piety ; (her) mind (is) replete with the sentiment of mercy ; (her) intellect (is) cleat ; (her) eyes (are) beautiful with love for the merit of friendship (and her) hands ar disposed in a peaceful posture. 
V. 4. Tictorious is the Buddha, the ascetic, whose intellect Is bright on account of the absence of partiality for (the three) qualities and desires of varipus kinds, who having curbed the triumphant joy of Mara was extolled by the groups of Siddhas.- 
V. :5. 1^hos seeing the highest bliss in the welfare of the sentient beings has perforated good action^ of various kinds for the sake of the needy even at the cost of his own life, which (actions) ^re eulogised in stories ; (and) who, having assumed by (his) power of yCga very many incarnatio|ts in the world, was always the sole (repository)4 of mercy such m the lord of sages. 
V. 6." That GodTishnu (BhagavSn) the Destroyer of Demons, who is the root cause of the worlds and the sole supportin the processes of dissolution and maintenance, created Brahman in the beginning. And by hiin (Brahman)- who is the store-house of the art of skill in the creation

2 Here, too, Prof. Kielhorn'g query about this king; being the son of Lakshmana should be deleted. 8 Aturva was a descendant of Bliyign.

One of these women secreted her embryo in her thigh* Hence the child that was born was called Aurva.

5 This name is not noticed by Prof. Kielhorn. 
6 The name of tbe king in this verse has disappeared in the missing portion of the stanza. * Prof. Kielhorn's summary here reads<4 her son Lakshmanaraja (II) ". The first word of the stanza is, however* most probably tasmat*

How lie succeeded in bringing out the "shapes of the letters accurately *^ 1 think, dm* to the little knowledge of drawing which he possessed and to his intelligence.

some cases he has to ascend a y&pa by a ladder, touch the mortar-shaped top-piece made of wheaten dough, rise by the measure of his head over the post and descend after performing certain rites Our pillar could nerve such a purpose very welt But here we should remember that Vajapeya is one of the .several Bftnm Mcrifire* which kings or Brihma^s have to offer beforecelebrating the RSjawy* and the BrihatpMtoava. Why should a sacrifice select a thing connected with a rite which is after ail a minor one aa compared to the principal Fo/Ca and write a large inscription on it giving the names of very high officials mteh as this pillar bears ? Jo solve such a question satisfactorily one would like to explore the site where the pillar was unearthed and see if any vestiges of some other sacrifice or itacritirftn are to be found there, 
The asvooiation of a rrwnrvoir or tank (Htrfcbandh) might suggest thispillar to be an ordinary tank-pillar, such as we ee erected in the midat of tanks in the Central Provinces or elsewhere. But then, we have to remember that such columns are generally of stone. Besides, there would be no reason why auch an important record should be incised on it mostly to remain hidden under water* Another likelihood may be that it was a jaja&tmfaha or column of victory, but there too, looking at th* positionof the personage rswponsiblefor its setting upand of the officers connected with him, it will be quite rwusonabl* to expect a more permanent and dignified material than an ordinary 6tyt r**f which the pillar islrnade. The other alternative would be that it was a dhmjmtamfah^ ojr a flagstaff connected with sonrf temple for, that may be made1 of stone or wood* circular* nixtMtt* or eight- sided and shaped Eke a ftum&ta (pot) at the middle or at the beginning.Its height varies according to its nature. The emblem (wShma] of the god to whom it ii dedicated i to be put cm it together with the banner cloth (dAw/a*pfa), Such an assumption would naturally the existence of tome structure close by and until we find any traces of it w* are not in a positionte* call the pillar a dH^mtm^M* Whether it is a post connected with the V&j&ftfytt or similar ritos or a Mwj&itamhka, the fact remains that it is a unique find yt made in India. 
The writtof cut thi* pillar vary resemble* that* of the Nlsik cave iwotiptions,8 Leav ing aside other aymbols the one (or kki is particularly noteworthy.

It ife not quite patent how a document issuedto^a private person found its wayjntothe treasniy of the^ temple of Ranganathasvamin at Srlrangam. Perhapsthe donor, a Srlvaish- ^ava, was a native of Snrangam, and he may have either deposited the copper-platesin the temple treasury for safe custodyor have presentedthe village"with its original deed of gift to the god Eanganatha. As regards the donee, nothing can be said definitely, as no distinguishing family names are affixed to his name; to which of the aeh&ry a-purusKafamilies he "belonged is 
no* easy to Ascertain, 
At the end of the document it is stated that the composerof the inscriptionis SabhSpati and the engraver Mallanacbarya, tha son of Viranacharya. 
The names of places, etc., which occur in the document are : Uyyagondacholendra-valS* nldu, [Trravjarar, Tirumihachchtr, E^akudi, Karkaktai, Pelaikndi and the rivers Kavri, VitSutanaja and N"attv5kkaL Of these Uyyagondacholendra-valanaduis the same as TTyyakfco^dlacltola-valana^n, an ancient division of the Chflla days, Tiruvarflr is a 'town of great importancefor the large Siva temple situated in it;it is in the Negapatam Taluk of the Tanjore^ District, Tirumihachchur, same as Tirumlyaeliclitir, a place whose praises are sung by the Saiya saints Tiru-Jnanasamhandha and Appar, is situated in the Nannilain Taluk, The river KSvM is too well known to need any comment. The NattavSkkal is the same as the NitfcSrs which runs through the Nannilam Taluk and the French territory of EaraikkSL Tbe river VirSntanaju seems to be the same as the Vlragalagaru, which runs through the IfSyavarara Taluk and disembogues south of Tranquebar.

For instance, vv, 1-28 of A.-Miml with those of the Conjeeverara Plates of KyishnadSvaraya edited in Vol. XHI, pp. 126*129. Yv. 9-11 found in A are omitted in B. Therefore vv. 1-8 of B agree ^itli 
YJ. 1-8 d A, and vv. 9-24 of B with vv. 12-23 of A. Since the genealogical 'portion of the maonptioiis A and B have been printed in the -Epigraphia Indica more than onoe, they are omitted in the transcriptB of the texts given below,

It was divided into thirty-two shares and distributed among Brah marias who had different gdtras, sutras and d&khas. The namea of the Brahmanas, however, are not given as prooiised. One share each was given to the gods Vishnu aud Siva in the village; and the ^ana-engraver Mallanacharya gets, as usual, one share for his work.

This inscription also is engraved on a aet of three plates, of which the first side of the first and the second side of the third plates are left unengraved j the rims of the platesare raised, The writing is very well preserved. This set also, like the other set A above, htis a ring and seal. The plates are not numbered. 
The alphabet in which the record is engraved is Nandinagari,, and the languages Sanskrit and Tamil; the earlier portion, describing the genealogy, the praises of the donor and the donee &&d the village granted, is in the Sanskrit language, while the latter portion describing the boundaries, etc., of the village granted,is in Tamil, The sign-manual, $rf VirupSksha, at the end of the document is written m the Telugu-KaunacJa alphabet. Theorthographical peculiarities of this epigraphare almost the same AS those of the other. In addition to those alreadydetailed under A, this inscription introduces visargasin a numberof places whei^ they a* superfluous, and in these instances they are marked off in the transcript by round brackets. The engraver has done his business iu a rather slovenly manner, allowing- many omissions and errors to occur in the document. 
The inscription belongsto the reign of Kpishttadeva-MaHftrgya and is dated Saka 1450 which corresponded to the cyclic year Ssrvajit.

The village of Hull, anciently termed Puli, lies in circa long. 75 14', lat. 15 47V about five miles east-hy-north of Satmdatti, the chief town of the Parasgad Taluk of the BelgaumDistrict. It was formerly a town of considerable importance, and was one of the"Eighteen Agraharas"(Dynasties of the Kan. Distr., p. 443n.), as some of its inscriptions testify. IKHe Archasological Survey of Western India .- Report of the First Season's Operations (1874), pp. 12-14, Dr. Burgess has given an account of its' chief architectural remains,- and in 188S the late Dr. Meet made a survey of its epigraphic records, as a result of which a number of ink impressions were prepared for him, which are now in the possession of the Trustees of the- Bnteh Hneenm.8 Of this collection the texts published below are the most important Their provenance is as follows : 
A (a vira-gal), of A.D. 985, from the north of the BhlmSsvara or Andba-kMyara temple. 
B (Jain), of A.D. 1044-45 a^d 1145, from the temple of Virabhadra C (Vaishnava), of A.D. 1082, from the same temple D (of the cult of Harihara), of A.D. 1097, from the same temple.

pa, or"Siddhappa of the Tank," stands OB. the eastern side of tke tank marked in Survey No. 694, towards the north-east of the village. It is of sandstone, of the Dravidian order, -containing a shrine with linga, walled mantapa^ and porch (now in rains). The Virakta mafcha is (or was) a building in the north-eastern partof the village, which served for lodg ing ascetics. 
The Elliot Collection (Royal Asiatic Society's copy) contains transcriptsof nine of these inscriptions : D. is given in vol. 1, foL 233a, B. ib., foL 284b, E1 . ib., foL 307a, GL ib., fol: 306b H. ib., fol. 412a, I. in vol. 2, fol. 374b, J. ib., foL 374b, K. ib., fol. 375a, and M. ib., foL lla. Ag usual, these transcripts leave much to be desired. 
A. OP THE REIGN OP TAILA II : SAKA 907. 
The following inscriptionis incised npon a black atone which was found to the north of the iBhlmSsvara or Andhakesvara temple, on the west bank qf the Akkatangera-bhavi,in Survey No. 693. The slab was set in a base, and was 5 ft. 2 in. in height and 2 ft. 1 in. broad. It was ja viva-gal, or hero's monument, a-nd in accordance with the usual practice was divided into horizontal compartments, four containing sculptures and three writing. Of the sculpturesI have been unable to obtain particulars. The first compartmentof the writing ( about 5f"high) contains 11. 1-4, the second (about 3f*high)11. 5-9, the third (about 2f'high)11 10-11 The inscriptionis fairly well preserved, and is in good Kanarese script, with letters between |" and |" in height. The special form of y noted above, Vol. XII, p. 336, seems to occur in bhanfay**, 1. 3. The language is Old Kanarese : 11. 1-4 are in prose, and then come three verses. The forms are those of a transitional period: thus we find the short accusative and genitive, the locative in -ol (11. 5-8, 10), and the verbal forms irdan (1. 5), ildan (1. 7), aandar (1. 4), beside the archaic verbal forms antoran (1. 5) and Mdidon (1. 8). The word eltu& apparently the original of the later ettu, seems to occur in bhandiy-eltam,1. 3. The I i not preserved, exceptin negalda (11. 8-9). 
The record is of the usual type of vtra-gal. It announces that on a certain: date Dadda payya, a pergade or official in the service of Sotahanayya, made a raid upon Puli, whereupon Kendara Keta, Bjevitta, and Tambada Keta attacked his party, slew the leader, his horse, and three of his men, and died the death of heroes. Verses 1-2 (11. 5-9) eulogise Kendara Kfcta; 
the mutilated and obscure verse 3 mentions a certain Kendara Marasimga as dying heroically in battle. 
The date of this record is : Saka 907 expired, the cyclic year PSrthiva 5the full moon of Chaitra; Budhavara, or Wednesday (11. 1-2). These details are slightly irregular:the titki CJhaitra sukla 15 of the given year correspondedto Monday, 9 March, A,D. 085, on which day it ended about 16 h. 47 m. after mean sunrise, and it cannot have been connected with *tke Wednesday.1 
The only place mentioned is Pfili, i.e. Hull (L 2).

This record is carved on a "black stone set upright in the ground against the outside of the western face of the Vlrabhadra temple (see above). The stone when found was* 4 ft. 7 in, high and 1 ft. 8 in. wide. The upper coiopartment, which was rounded on the top, contained sculptures, m$n in the centre, a squatting Jina facing to the front, with a cow and calf on the proper right and a scimitar on the left, while above these was the sun (to left) and moon.

and in 1, 3 from T^ in. to f in., after wliiclh. it increases gradually to "between Jin. to in. It is a fairly good typeof tiie script used in the middle of the 12th century A.D. (see below). The language is throughout Old Kanarese, verse and prose, with the exceptionof the introduc tory Sanskrit verse. The I is not preserved: instead we findTJ in elgeyam (I 12), pogalut* (L 13), podalda (1. 16), ndlke (1. 16), pelu (1. 20), pel (1. 54), and on the other hand r in erdda (1. 6) and negardda (11. 12, 18). On the instrumental artthiye (L 14) see above, Vol. XIV, p-27, n. 9. Of some lexical interest are the words chatta-samaya (1. 9), (?)ayavana (1, 9), Urtikad** amka~p"ala"ka (1. 14), and adda-chinna (11. 35, 49). 
The record is a double one, .containing two endowments, the first of which is dated in Saka 966 and the second in Saka 1067. It was actually written in its present form in the latter year, as is proved by the absence of comminatory formulae and the character of the script. The first part refers itself to the reign of Ahavamalla (S5msvara I) in 11. 3-5, and then proceedsto celebrate in verse his feudatory Kaladiya Bolagadi (or Bodsgadi), the governor of a Maety six district, wT hose son Payimma married Hammikabbe and by her had two daughters, Bhagenabbe and Lachchal or LachcMyabbe. Lachchale married a governorof the Kundi Three-thousand, and was a generous benefactress of religion (11. 5-15), After some verses in praise of Puli and the thousand Brahman burgesses of that town (11. 15-20) comes a prose statement that these burgesses sold to Lachchiyabbe an estate, on which she constructed a Jain sanctuary, assigning certain lands for the maintenance thereof, and appointingas trustee Balachandra-Bhattarakadeva (11. 20-37). Then begins the second document (11. 37-54), which announces that in the reign of Jagadekamalla (II) a local pergade named ISTemana or Wemayya, having purchased some land from the burgesses of Puli, made a farther endowment to the same sanctuary for the maintenance of the ascetics residing in it, th.e trustee being a certain Rsmacliandrad&va. This Nemana was a great-grandson of the above-mentioned Lachchiyabbe, Ids pedigree being as follows :

The document then ends somewhat abruptly, without any concluding formulae This record, being twofold, contains two dates. The first is given on 11. 20-22 as : Saka 966 expired, the cyclic year Tarana, PushyaSuddha 10, Adivara (Sunday), the uttarayana* samkranti. Thesef details have been recently examined by Mr. A. Venkatasubbiah in Swne $aka, Dates in Inscriptions, p. 129, who remarks as follows :"Tarana by the northern hrai-solar system=. 966=A.D. 1042. In this year,su. 10 of the lunar month Pushya ended at 44 gK 21 jp. after mean sunrise on 24th December, on which day, the Makara-sankranti occurred at 14 gK. 38 jp* after meap. sunrise according to the SQrya- Siddhanta.

TRANSLATION, 
(Verse 1.) Victorious be the teachingof the Lord of the Three Worlds, enjoined by the Ji&as, wliich bears the infallible token of the blessed and supremely profound doctrine of alter natives ! 
(Lines 3-5.) When the victorious reign of hail ! the asylum of the whole world, favourite of Fortune and Earth, great Emperor, supreme Lord, supreme Master, ornament of Satyasraya*s race, embellishment of the CMlukyas, king Ahavamalla, was advancing in a course of successively increasing prosperity, (to endure) as long as moon, sun, and stars : (L* 5.) One who finds his sustenance at his lotus-feet 
(V. 2.) Uprooting High-rising foes, spreading abroad his fame as far as the walls of the sky quarters, Kaladiya Bol^adi perfectly (?) protected the JSTmety-six by the might of bis arm. (V. 3.) To the renowned Hamr^ikabbe,the distinguished wife of his son the cultured prince PSyimma, a peerof Sita, wer^ bom BMgenabbe and Lacheliale. (V. 4.) In the chatia-samaya? of agreeable persons, in the feeding of Brahman house holders, IB (the supply of) measured spoons3 to distinguished ascetics, in {furnishing) fire-places with rows of maidens, indeed, the four churches4straightway were delighted with affection : who are equal to LachcMyabbarasi on the earth with its stock of living and lifeless things ? (V. 5.) While illustrious eulogists are active over the whole earth, the world with joy praises for excellence of beauty, eminent generosity,distinction of race, and sincere devotion to the Jinas* feet LaehchaiadeYl, the exceedingly high-born wife of the Umkad^arhka-pala'ka of Kftndi.* 
1 Read JZalafavallifferiya, 
2 TMs phrase is obscure. It seems most probaMe that chatta is to be taken as a derivative of Sanskrit $%at (cf . Tamil tott&-v&rggam). Six s&maya* (schools of religion or philosophy) are often mentioned. The Saivaa recog-> iiiae as orthodox the Bhairava, Varna, Kalamnklia, Mahavrata, Pasapata, and Saiva samayas, and as unorthodox the Lokayatas, Buddhists, Jains, Mimamsakas, Pancharatras, and Bhattacliaryas. Another group is : Buddhists, Jains, Bhairavas, Kallinnkhas,, Lokayafcas, and Sftnyavadins. Six Vaidic samayas are recognised, mz. Saiva, TowhwaTO, Sakta, Saara, Ganapata, and Kaumara ; and there are six Vedantic samayas, viz. Kapila, Kanada, Fatawfala, Akshapada or Nyaya, Vaiyfisa, and Jaiminlya. The Vaishnavas admit 6 samayas as orthodox, tns. those of Sankara, Yadava Hisra, Bamanuja, Madhva, Bhaskara, and Hiranyagarbha 
8 The reading here is certain, but the division and sense are not. J[yavana is a rare Atharva-vedic word eiplftined aststirring-spoon"; but here it seems to have another meaning. 
4 The four tamaya* are the Mahesvaras, Vaislmavas, Buddhists, and Jains. 
* I can only conjecture that limJea is connected with lem%at "servant," and that aihfca is used in the snie of *wftr,1'ef. amtoaMfa) ; the phraae would then mean something like"Commander of the military forces of *'[Se foot-note 6. p. 174, above Ed.]

(V. 6.) Pfili, which is indeed a site of conspicuous charm, appears with, the aspectof a beauty-spot uponthe county of Belyaias which is radiant like the lotus-face of that fair lady the ocean-girdledearth.

0. OE THE REIGN OP VIERAMADITYA VI: THE 7TH TEAR. 
This inscription is on a black stone built into the western wall inside the templeof Vlrabhadra, at its north-western comer. The stone itself was 4 ft. 11 in. high and 2 ft..2| in. broad. On the upper compartment, which was rounded, were the following sculptures : in the centre a standing figure of Vishnu, facingfull front ;to the proper right of this, a kneeling Garu4a, facing half towards Vishnu and half towards the front; to the left of Vishnu, a cow with calf; above these, the sun (on left) and moon (on right). There may hare been some other derails concealed under the coating of chunam uponthe stone. Under this is the inscribed area, 3 ft. 3 in. high and 2 ft, 2|in. wide. The character is Kanarese of the period, a fine ornamental hand with a tendency towards flourishes. The letters, which are generally well preserved, are from f in. to T\ in, high. -The language, with the exception of the formal Sanskrit verses 1, 12, and 13,is Old Kanarese, Initial p is preserved. Tie archaic Z remains in negaUar (1. 22) and negalda, (L 23), where the vowel before it is metrically short; on this point I may refer to my observations above, Vol. XIII, p. 327. On the other hamd^is changed to Z in alidamge (L 15), bilgum (I 17), ISlpadav* (1. 26). The doubled in SJ&ndillya, for Sinijilya, (I. 21), is worth" notice : cf. Paiini VIII. iv. 47, Siddh$nta~ kaumwdt 48, 
The record, after referring itself in 11, 2-5 to the reign of TribhuvanamaUa (Vikramlditya VI), gives in 1L 5-11 details of an endowment, consistingof certain land*, which were purchased by Kisuv&yara Bavikimayya-WSyaka, a distinguished member of the Huixlred Brahman burgesses of Raviyanegeri (a subdivision of the Thousand burgeases of Pftli), for the upkeep of a temple of Vishnu which he had built. After some hortatory matter in prose (1L 11-14) md verse (11. 1547) the author proceeds to celebrate in verse Bejvala, Pflli, the Thousand Brahmans of Pftli, the Hundred of Raviyanaggri forming a part of them, the family of the donor, and the latter personally (11.17-30).

(Verse 1.) Victorious is the manifested Boar-form of Vishnu that stirs up the ocean aac holds the earth at rest upon the tip of his uplifted right tusk, 
(Lines 2-4.) When the victorious reign of hail 1 the asylum of the whole world, favourite of Fortune and Earth, great Emperor, supreme Lord, supreme Master, ornament of race, embellishment of the Ch&lnkyas, king Vribhuvammalla, was advancing in a course of successively increasing prosperity, (to endure) as long as moon, sun, and stars : 
(LI. 4-5.) on the uttar&yana-sariikranti of the 7th year of the Ghaliikya-Vikrama era* the cyclic year Dnndubbi : 
(LI, 5-11.) the Thousand, headed by the mayor, of the Agrahara of Pali, who practise the major and minor disciplines, scriptural study, spiritual concentration, observance of the vow of silence, prayer, oblation, and absorption,1 for the purpose of fostering the religious practice of (the temple of) the god Karayana constructed by KisuvSyara BaYikimayyB NSyaka, for the restoration of outworn (buildings) and (renewal of) broken and burst (masonry) belonging to the god,for foaths9 perfumes, incense, lights, and oblations, for the personal enjoy ment (of the god}, and for the choultry, Bavikimayya-NEyaka made over to the god Narayans six mattar at the Bhatfcas* Lake (and) one maitar of gravel soil (?) at the Stonemasons' Tank* for which he had arranged the purchase with pouring of water and gift of m-mey from the Hundred of RaviyanagSri . 
(LI. 11-11.) So the Thousand shall protectthis pious foundation as a tarva-namasya holding. To those who protect it shall accrue T.he meiit of making the great gifts at the holy places of Benares, Knrnkshetra, Arghyatirtha, Prayaga, and Gaya ; knowing this to be so, the Thousand shall protectit for the continuous increase of religion as long as moon, sua, and stars 
endure. 
(V, 2.) To him who protects (the foundation) duly as it was given by him (who established it) shall befall the fulfilment of the objects o his desire. To him who appropriates and destroys it shall accrue the guiltof downright cold-blooded slaughterof Bra,hmans,Goravass herds of kine, and women;he shall fall into (degraded) forms of rebirth. 
(V. 3.) The county of Belvala is the face of the ocean-girt Earth. Like a beauty spot thereon is the town of Pflli, overspread with loveliness;a home of sages there is in this excellent town. 
(V. 4.) The Thousand (of Puli) are noble Brahmans possessing boundless virtues, active in works of kindness and beneficence, practising the major and minor disciplines, scriptural study, and other duties, far removed from all sin, 
(V. 5.) Among them, the Hundred of Raviyanageri, who are eminent in the lore of the VSdas and devoted to the six practices,3 have displayedto an exalted degree exceedinglybrilliant glory on earth.

3X_OF THE HEIGHT OF VIKBAMADITYA VI: SAKA 1019 
- This document is cut upona slab of black stone that was found built into the outside of the northern or front face of the templeof Vlrabhadra, on the western side of the door. The stone is 3 ft. 10|in. above the ground, and 2 ft. in width. It has a rounded top, with the following sculptures in the uppermost compartment: in the centre Vishnu1 standing, and fac ing full front; to his proper right successively, beginning from him, Nandi, a priest .behind Nandi standing facing Vishnu, and two kneeling worshipperslikewise facingthe god ; to the god's left, successively a kneeling Garu^a (half turned towards Vishnu and half ttf front), a cow wrfli calf, and a scimitar; above all "these are the sun (on right) and moon (on left) Below iihis is the inscribed area, measuring 2 ft. 10| in. in height and 1 ft. 11 in. in breadth. It is on the whole well preserved.^-The character is good Kanarese, but of a type about a century later than the alleged date of the record (aka 1019) ; it may be a genuinelater copy of the original grant, but in estimatingIts authenticity we must note also the irregularity of the date* The letters in lines 1-4 are about in. high ; then they begin to increase in height, and from line 6 cmward are on the average about fin. The letter fi in rishi (1. 13)is apparently re presented by a modified ri. The special cursive form of t? (above, Vol. XII, pp. 335, n 1 and 337) appears 39 times, as far as the text is legible. The language, exceptin lines 1-2 (verses 1-3, followed by the formula namo Jtfarayanaya), which are in Sanskrit, is Kanarese, verging on the medieval dialect. The archaic I is always changed to I (m&lJceyin,1. 15; mftlpar, 1. 22; hala, 11. 35, 51-53; aUdhavh[ge] 9 1. 58 ; b$lg[um]9 L 60). F is changed sporadicallyto b (Irajad**, 1. 13; dibyam, 1. 23; Iya\tf\patamuifh9 1. 25 ; difya-, L 32; drabya-, 1. 37), The npadhm&mya is falsely written in Aputita- (1. 33), for tpfatfftcu The consonant t is doubled before y in atty&yata- (1. 18) and atiyarhta- (I. 20) ;cf , above, on IBBCT. C. Initial a ig written y& (1.* 36). In the prose parts final m before a vowel is 
y changed to v, and initial p becomes h in Mia (11. 35, 51-53), hasug* G1 ' 35, 51), (1. 36) fcx*IaIK (1. 38), hannwhdu (II 39, 43), hSrivhge (1. 55), horege (ib.), (ib.), Jwnnaih (1. 56 f.), while it remains in pajeda, pa^a, paifuvana, patfuvalu. As TOgwds flerion, we find an accusative plural in final -a three times (-padaihgala,11, 37, 39, 42), and a corresponding adverb (-purwaJca, 11. 42, 50) ; that this is the genuine medieval form, and not a mere slip, is suggested by the adverb tcutotata (L 22) and the dative n$yakarhga (L 16), wh0re &a vocaEo ending is guaranteed by the metre. There are a few words of lexiisal interest, rigiit -]*lira>^ ^^^by w* a ^nd U of tlie hweriptfan and the figure of mndi to the proper

such as udgr&hakar, I 9 (spelt udvLgrahaJcarvi), "studying successfully"(cl the Sinlialese ugannava,"to learn "), and the technical terms karuva, 11. 39, 43 (from karma ?), ata, II. 52-3, (P) 1* 54, and hottalit, 1. 55. 
The record, after three introductory verses, refers itself to the reign of Tritalravanamalla (Vikramaditya VI)9 and then launches out into verse in praise of Kuntala, Belvala, Puli, the Thousand Mahajanas of Piili, and the Hundred of Kalasavalligeri (11 1-13). Among the last named was a distinguished Brahman family, the Ajjavas, belonging to the AtrSya gfitra; to this stock belonged S6bhana:Hyaka9 who begot by Muddikavve Nakimayya (ETakarasa or Nakiyanna). Nakimayya begot by j$~agikavve Nanimeya, Ramadeva,, and Mahadeva (written Mahadeva for the sake of metre), and rebuilt a temple of Vishnu in Puli (11. 13-23). Then follow specificationsof various purchases of land acquired by NSkimayya from the Hundred of Baviyanageri, Kalasavalligeri, and .GrhaiSasagSri, and from the Thousand of Pnli (11. 23-53) .. Two minor endowments (11. 53-57) and a hortatory stanza (11. 58-60) conclude the document. 
The date of the record is stated, on 11. 23-25 as : Saka 1019 (expired), the cyclic year Ifivara; Pushya suddha 5, Adityavara (Sunday), the uttaray ana-8aitihr&nti,the vyatlpata, or ydga in which the declination of sun and moon are identical* This date again is irregular. Pusiiya suddha 5 of the given year corresponded to Saturday, December 12, AJX 1O97 ; it began about 53 m. after mean sunrise on the preceding Friday, and ended about 34 m. after mean sunrise on the Saturday. It could not be connected with the uttarayana-samkranti, which occurred 10 K 45 m. after mean sunrise on Thursday, 24 December twelve days after it. 
The places mentioned, besides Puli and the ttrthas in 1, 58, are Zuntala (1. 4), BelTala (L 5), Kalasayalligeri (11. .12, 37, 38), Baviyanageri (11. 34, 53), ahaisisageri (1/40), Konalageri (? 1. 50), Kattiyageri (1. 52), and some minor localities;see above.

The first grant begins by referring itself to the reignof Tribhuvanamalla (VikramSditya VI) and then states that a general and minister, who was also Steward of the Royal Kitchen, by name Anantapalarasa, had a son-in-law, Lakkarasa, a general who administered Belvala and Puligore ;and this Lakkarasa, with the authority of Anantapalarasa, commissioned a certain Sifcgsrasa to assign one share in the proceedsof fines leyied in Pflli to the treasuryof the gad Amdhasura, a form of Siva (11. 2-7). This was accordingly done, under the auspicesof the Acbarya Tatpurusha, a diaciple of JfianaSakti ; this JfianaSakti was a distinguished dmne aod scholar, to whom king Bhnvanaikamalla (Somesvara H) paid particularreverence, IB connec tion with which a fine templeof Siva (probablythat bearingthe name of Andlpsura,with wJnoh the present series of grantsis concerned) was built (11. 748). Then comes, a-*- - supplement to this grant, a record of two endowments of Andhasura. The first (1 with verses praising the town of Pflli and its mayor (fir-o^a), a scion of the named Maiigalarnava, who seems to have won some renown in the wars againsttjie i and Claras, and is stated to hare settled 1,000 BrShmans on an estate granted by

himself ; after this come verses in praise of the Thousand, who are said to have built a stately temple of Andhasura (probably that already mentioned). Then follows another supplement (0. 36-38), chronicling a donation of land by four persons. 
The second main division of the record (11. 40-47) announces gifts of land to Andhasura from the above-mentioned JfiSnas'akti (11. 40-44) and the Thousand (11. 44-47). Next comes a third paragraph (11. 47-52) announcingthe gift of some land to the god by the Hundred of Kalasavalli gSri, the Thousand of Pali, and a certain Kalidevayya-Sefcti. Last comes an unfinished paragraph, added long after the preceding, to chronicle a grant by the guild of weavers to the Achlrya Vamasakti for the expenses of the establishment (11. 53-56). 
Corresponding to its composite character, our inscription contains four dates The first of these is given on 13. 7-8 as : the 29th year of the Chalukya-Vikrama era, the cyclic year Tarana Pushya addha 10, Brihaspativara (Thursday) ; the uttarayana-samkrant*.

Ine tithi Poshya guddha 10 corresponded properly to Wednesday, 28 December, A D 1104 on which it ended about 18 h. 25 m. after mean sunrise, i.e. about 12.25 P.M., so that the con-' section with the following Thursday is not far wrong.

This is an inscription on the upper partof a black stone -found standing in the mandapa on the southern side of the entrance Into the adytum of the temple of Kere-Siddhappa. The lower paii of the stone, with the Inscription from 1. 31 onwards, has been broken away and lost. What remains. Is 3 ft. S| in. high and 1 ft. 8| in, wide. It has a rounded top, on which are sculptures, ufc. in the centre a linga ; to the proper right of this, a squatting figure, possibly Siva or a YSgl ; to the left of the linga, a cow with calf; over the cow, a scimitar; above these, the sun (to right of lingo) and moon (to left). The inscribed area below this is 2 ft. 2| in. high and 1 ft. 8| In, broad. Tlie character is good Kanareae of the period, with letters about |In. high; which, however, become smaller as the inscription goes on. The cursive v occurs in ryatip&tadalu, I, 26.

The date of this record is given on 11. 24-26 as : Saka 1029 (expired), the cyclic year Sarvajit ; Pushya uddha 12, Budhavara (Wednesday) ;the uttarftyaQa-savtihrSnti.

removed by Mm into the porch of another temple which stands a few yards to the north of the BhlmSlvara, and for which the villagers had no certain name, though they inclined to. call it the TarakesVara. The stone is 6 ft. 2 in. high (not reckoningthe tenon at its base) ;its breadth is 1 ft. 9 in, at the first line of writing, and 2 ft. 1 in. at the base. The basis in which it ori ginally stood has been lost. It is divided into seven compartments,four containing sculptures and the intermediate three the text. . The uppermost compartment, which is rounded at the top9 lias in the centre a linga in a shrine;on the proper rightof this is GangSa seated and facing iull front, with a worshipperat his rightknee.

The record itself is of a type common on monuments of the kind. It begins by referring itself to tie 82nd year of the Ciaalukya-Vikrama era9 i.e. of the reignof Vikramaditya VI, and thea relates in prosethat a certain Torapara Butayya carried off cows belongingto Piili,. and thereupon Gangara Bosi (Bosiga)and his messmate and comrade Peyuv* Malli (Malliga) made a brave attemptto recover them, in which they perished. Each of these heroes has a verse devoted to his praise. 
The Torapasare mentioned as enemies of the Hundred-and-four Mahajanas of B5ri in an in scription of Ron of Saka 1102 which is also being published by me in this Journal. It styles the latter Tofapa-kulstiitakawwn. -Apparently they were a race of bandits. 
The date of the inscriptionis given on 11. 1-2 as : the 32nd year of the ChaJ.ukya-Vikrama era, the cyclic year Sarvajit ; Sravana "bahula 5, Vaddavara (Saturday). This is regular.

Ho OF THE REIGN OF VIKBAMA'DITYA VI 
This is a fragment of a Jain record. It is cut on the upper part of a uiack stone which* was found lyingin the courtyard of the Panchalinga temple, and was placed by Dr. Fleet for secu rity in the sablia-mandapa of the sanctuary. The lower part of the slab was lost. The remainder was 2 ft. 7^ in. high and 2 ft. 8 in. broad. The topmost compartment, which was rounded, contained sculptures, viz. in the centre a squatting Jina (Parvanatha ?) facingfull front, with a canopy of inflated cobras' hoods over his head, in a shrine, and having below him a pedestal with a floral device and on each side of it a lion; to his proper right a cow and calf; to his left a scimitar; above him, to the left, the sun and moon. The inscribed area beneath this is 1 ft. 4 in. high and 2 ft. 7J in. broad. The character is good Kanarese, with letters of about | in. high. The language is Sanskrit (verses 1-4 and 6) and Old Kanarese (verses 5, 7-17 and prose). As regards the latter, we may note that I is not found;it appearsas I (pogalvinam 1. 4, podalda,1. 10, pogalut**,1. 20) andr (ndrppajanie, 1. 9, norppcufe, 11. 10, 11, negardda, 1. 18). The words jagadalam, 1. 17, liriikad^amka, 1. 19 (see above, on inscr. B., 1. 14), and kal-vesarii 1. 21 may be noticed. 
The records after the usual Jain prelude, extols in poetrythe Ga^iadhara Sudharman, Bathiibalin, the famous Jain divine of the Kandtm-G-ana of the Yspaniya-Sangha, Subha chandra and Maunideva, of the same Gana, and Maghanandin (11. 1-5).1 Then it refers itself in prose to the reign of Tribhuvanamalladeva (Vikramaditya VI), whom it lauds in verse (11* 6-9), thence proceedingto extol in verse Knntaja, possibly Belvala, and Ptli with its Thousand Mahajanas (11; 9-15).It next gives the titles of an otherwise unknown raja named Pitta, who afcyled himself" Lord of Kolala, best of cities"(11. 15-17J, and adds in verse that he had four sons, Perma, Bijja or Bijjala9 KTrtti, and Gorma, and a daughter, Mailaladevi ; Bijjala slew certain kings, and had some relations (a lacuna prevents us from -knowing what they were) with king Jayasimha of the Gurjarashtra, possibly the Paramara Jayasimha of Matws, who 'flourished about 1055 A.D. (11. 19-20). A mutilated verse speaksof Rvakanirma<Ji as sister of king ICanhara, comparing to her SiriySdevi as sister of somebodyelse (1. 20). We then learn that Bijjala built a Jain sanctuary, which possibly may be the Panchalinga, and appa r&utly that he or somebody else granted to it a place named Pergummi(P). The rest is lost. 
The reference to Bevakanirmadi and- Kanhara is interesting. Kanhara is the Eashtra kuta Krishna III, and Revakanirmacli was his elder sisterjshe married the G-anga Satyavakya Butnga H9 who succeeded between 933 and 940 A-.D.3 This fact, and the titles"Gaogeya of tke Gangas"and"lord of K^lalapura,"indicate that Pitta was a scion of the Ganga family, 
The places mentioned, besides Puli, are Kuntala (1. 9), Kolalapura, i.e. Kolhapur3(1. 16) , the G-urjarashtra, -i.e. Gajarat (1. 19), Belvala (1. 22), .Pergummi (*.), and MSnikya-tlrttha (1. 24). 
1 Bahutoalin is well known. MagbaUamUn and Subhacbaudra may conceivably be the same as the divine.; so named who are mentioned in Inscr. Sraoana J9^o/a, Nos. 404, 48, 45-9, 59,64-5, 144, and J. -4., Vol. XIV p. 82. A Maunada Bbattara is mentioned in Inscr. Srav. Belgola, No. 6..

The inscription runs along the bottom of the beam, covering an area 2 in. high and 6 ft. 2| in. broad. The character is Kanarese, of about the same date as Nos.

The objeqt of the inscriptionis to celebrate the beautyof the archway above mentioned, on the beam of which it is engraved. We learn that the archway was constructed at the instance of Jnstaa^akti, whom we have already encountered in Nos. E. and I. above. The third verse praises the virtues of Marttanqla, who may possibly have been a disciple of this sage ; his connection with the work is not clear, but conceivably he may have caused the inscriptionto be added some time after the construction of the archway.

This inscriptionis engravedon a Hack stone which was found on the road outside the house known as the Viraktermatha, and was placet byDr. Fleet for securityin the sabhu-manjapa of the Pafichalioga temple. The heightof the stone is 5 ft. 2 in. and the width 1 ft. 9|in. The rounded top bears sculptures, via. in the centre a standing Vishnu, facingfull front; to his proper right, a kneeling Garuda facingfull front;to the left of Vishnu, a cow with calf ;over them, the SUE (to left) and moon (to right). Under this is an inscribed area, 3 ft. 5 in, high and 1 ft. 8i in, wide. The character is fairly good Kanarese of the period, well preserved. The average height of the letters is about |in. The language is Old Kanarese, verging on the medieval dialect in the prose, with two openingstanzas and a final verse in Sanskrit. The upadJmSnlya appears*in 7ishnuk*p,1. 2. The I is not preserved: we find nnegarda,1. 11, and on the other hand elgeyol, 1*25, Mia, 1. 393and bilgum,1. 47. The treatment of initial p fluctuates : we have it changed in the proseto h in Tiala hasugey* ,1. 39, hittilalu 1. 43, Jiarada-, 1.43, Jiannondam, I 44, while in other cases it is preserved. On the genitive sUa-&sJitara (I. 19; the same in inscr. M., 1. 25) see my note in Journ. R. Asiat. 800,, 1918, p.105. 
The record refers itself in II, 4-6 to the reignof the Kalachurya kingTriblitivanamalla deva (Bijjaia), and then proceeds to singin verse the praises of Poll, the Thousand Mahajanas thereof, and the Hundred of Siveyageri forming partof them (11. 6-12) ;and it celebrates the excellences of a familyin the latter parish, givingthe following pedigree (11. 12-33): Malapayya, ' of 
KSlimayya, m. Eeviyakka 
Dasiraja, m. Olajale and Bhagale 
Mahadeva Maiayya 
We then learn that on the given date Dasiraja restored the decayed templeof Kesava (Vish^n) of Eagarakhandi, reconsecrated it, and bought from the Thousand of Pnli some land which lie assignedfor its maintenance (11. 33 ff.). 
The date of this record is given on 11. 33-34 as : Saka 1084 (expired), the cyclic year ChiiraWhlnu ; Pushya hahula 2, SSmavara (Honda/) ;the iittarayantt-samkranti, This is nearly but not quite regular The given tithi coraesponded to Tuesday, 25 December, A..B. 1162 ; it began ahout 13 h. 18 m. after mean sunrise n the preceding Monday, and ended about 12. h, 58 m. after mean sunrise on the Tuesday, with which it was properlyconnected. The uttarH yana-samlrmititook place about 6 h. 18 m. after mean sunrise on the Tuesday, while the tithi bfthula 2 was still current.

TRANSLATION, 
(Verse 1 : identical with verse 1 of inscriptionC. above.) 
(V. 2.) Vishnu is in the waters, Vishnu is on laud, Vishnu is on the mountain-top, Vishnu is on the multitude of lines of fire : the whole universe is- composed of Vishnu. (Lines 4-6.) When the victorious reignof hail ! the asylum of the whole world, favourite of Fortune and Earth, lord of Kal&mjiana, best of cities, attended by the sound of (jamaruga drums and (other) musical instruments, the Ka|.acliurya Empqroy, strongof arm, Tribb.iivanamalladevaf was advancing in a Course of successively increasing prosperity, (to endure) as long as moon, sun, and stars : 
(V. 3.) With a profusionof delightful pleasances, with the company of all _the gods with men skilled in renowned familiarity with the lore of the Eik, Yajus, Sanaa* and Atharvana Vedas, with the blest Kottaja well, with ponds, not to speak of companies of fair women, (and) an unbroken line of flower-gardens,Pttli in truth possesses a charming aspect. 
(V. 4) What men on earth are such as to bear comparison with the renown of these Thousand, who in sooth resemble the Sun in brilliance, Indra in majesty, CMnakya in policy, Manu in beautiful conduct, the ocean in profundity,the great Golden Mountain in firmness ? (Line 11.) In that (town),*** 
(V. R) While the earth lauds them by sayingthat each of them,^if oneconsiders,^is omniscient in the illustrious lore of the VSdas, the Hundred in the blest SiveyagSriare verily 
distinguished. 
(L. 12.) Among them, 
(V. 6.) A leader of the Bharadvaja race, beautiful of conduct, discreet, a lord of speech, a bee to the lotus-feet of Kamsa's foe [Krishna], generous,the noble sheriff H^apayya was eminent. 
(V. 7.) To this noble man was bom (a son)like in form to the dear son of the lady Fortune : who is peer to the greatminister Kajimayya, renowned in the circuit of the earth ? (V. 8.) His excellent high-bornwife BSviyakka, a mine of propriety, may be said to surpass Slta, Arundhati, and Ratlin eminence, virtue, (and) renown : who does not praise (Tier) in these terms ? 
(V. 9.) To this couple was born a lover of the VSdanta, a votary of Ananta, by name the blest Bssiraja ; he is exalted, renowned in glory,like the San. 
(V. 10.) His conduct is a basic rule for worthy saints, his learning a festal ornament for the Goddess of Speech, his fame a festoon of flowering creeping-plantsfor the ladies of the regions of space, MB power (like) the gold which agreeable and cultured men h*ve laid in deposit1: heace what other men are such as to comparewith the sheriff DSsirSja, a crowd of good qualities, a celestial tree of noble fortune ? 
(V. 11.) Inborn truthfulness, the generousvirtues of his Jineage, conpnitel a#^da tum of good qualities, natural instinct for propriety, the religious pra#tie*sof his race, beautiful conduct, bis own life devoted to the benefit of friends, the congenital aten4ant triad of powers of counsel being his, who are superior to the blest D&sirSjaP 
(V. 12.) Do any even observe religious vows like the lady Olajaje, Pfsi's high-born wife, who is like Eati in form, like Bharati in graceof speech, lifce4ifaa *ftrfch ffl steadiness f 
* This seems to mean that his power is like the propertyof Brahmans, In that it was not liable to by advene occupation or UalMIftBi (&arada,.Smriti L 81, JBri************ix" l^aBdH), andtbet it comid notbe taken from him (tfarada~s xviii. 49) ; or that it enabled him to acquire boundless worlds, like tbe gift 01 property to Brahmans (JLpa*tamba*dh&rma*iitrQ II. x. 6, 1). ^t

(V. 13.) Is she fully equalledthe high, degreeof beauty of Lakshml born from the churningof Hie Milk Ocean, the greatnessof wifely devotion, presentin Gauri, (and) the series of gracesof speechof the charming lady Yak, who on this earth now are peerto DasirSja's beloved BaSgale ? 
(L. 27.) Their eons : 
(V. 14.) Fortune abode with great delightin his house ; the lady Vak adorned with magnificenceresided in his mouth; his goodly fame completelyfilled (every place) from Setu to the great SnowyMountains : hence was DSsiraja's son lord Mahadeya,1 that gem-mine of nobility, an ordinary man ? 
(V. 15.) Like Dhruva2 in* firmness, like the Lotus-born (Brahman) in eloquence, like the comely Madhava, in his form, like the Sun in bounty, like the Jar-born (Agastya) in right conduct, like the ocean in profundity, when one considers what men are equal to the sheriff Disirsja's son Majayya P 
(LI. 33-34) On Monday, the 2nd of the dark fortnightof Pusiiya in the cyclic year OhitrabhSnu, the 1084th (year)of the blessed aka era, on the holy lunar day of the 
, 
(LL 34-42.) As the temple of Keava of Nagarakhancli was falling into decay, the sheriff BasirSja, having restored the decayed parts and reconsecrated itf adored with(offering of) money the divinelyblest lotus-feet of the Thousand Mahajanas, headed by the mayor, of the great acfr&Mra of Puli and for the restoration of (broken, burst, and decayed (masonry oj the temple)of ihat godand for the regular oblations, Qhaitra-pavitra rites,8perpetual lamps, and stipendfor the officiating priest, purchased and grantedsix mattar within the waste-land hasuge of Kokkuligeri, on the west of Kattiyageri, on the north of the field of Galatige, (and) on the east of (the sanctuary of) the Chikkanikas' god, on which is to be paid an ag-u-vana at the rate of one p&na on each mattar* 
(LL 42-46.) Haying again adored the Thousand with (offering of) gold, they purchased and granted,to the same god a dwelling one cubit in width and eleven in length in the meyya sthala north of KalaiavalligSri, east of the traders' house at the backyard of the town house, as a sarva-namasya holding. So the Thousand shall religiously protect this monastery and field in respect of any minor claims to possession that may arise. 
(V. 16.) Eealise this with conviction : the great sinner who comes to overthrow thia pious foundation will inevitably sink to levels of (degraded) rebirth, together with his race; so to the king who cheerfully guards it in due wise 'shall accrue increase of vitality, most brilliant fortune, stainless fame, luck, welfare, happiness.

The record, after preliminariesof the usual sort, eulogises Pflli, its Thousand Mah&janas, and the Hundred of Siveyageri (11. 4-13). It then givesin 11. 13-31 the pedigree of the same family which figures in inscription L. ahove, but with some more details : putting the two together, we have the genealogy :

Two vigorous vei-ses then introduce king Bijjala (11. 31-34). Next comes prose referring the record to his reign and giving him full regal titles2(11. 34-37), followed by tho date (11. 37-38) and details of some lands purchased and granted by Dasiraja for the upkeep of the Nagara-Bhavi and some other local establishments and for the expensesof the worship of the Agasty^svara temple (11. 38 ff.). 
The date, given on 11. 37-38, is identical with that of inscription L. 
The places mentioned are, besides PtLli, giveyageri (1. 13), KslSmjana (1. 35 : see above, on inscr. L.), ITsga-vSvi (1. 39), Kattiyageri (L 41), Hsgarakhamdi (L 41 : see on inscr.

Y<ram4ageri (i.e. Eramda-geri,the "street of the oatoivoll plants ") seems to be another of the parishesof Puli.

miles to the north of Malrwa Railway Station on the Bengal and North-Western Baiiway, and made over to the Maharaja of Majhauli. At my visit to this village, I did not notice any other antiquities of specialinterest. The village itself is, however, situated on a large ancient mound and the size of bricks unearthed "by the villagers averages 11" x 9" x 2". 
The plates are inscribed on one side only and measure Uf by IQf* and 14f" "by XQf7, respectively. The edges of the plates are fashioned into rims the maximum height of wlich is |". Both the plates were originally soldered on a circular ring passing through the upper part of Plate II and the lower part of Plate I, Plate I is loose on account of a small piece having broken away from the ring-hole. The seal is now attached to Plate II and is of the usual G-ahadavala type. The only orthographical peculiaritiesin the record that deserve special 
mention are the use of j for yin parjantafy (1. 18) and jatha (I. 25) and the confusion of s and s and of v and 6. A for ya in viskthaam (1. 30) is an evident mistake or aPrakritism. The form utakeritam in 1, 36 evidently stands for utktrnnam or the causal utMritam. There are many other mistakes of spelling in the inscription and they have all been corrected in the text. 
The inscriptionconsists of 36 lines, of which 19 are engraved on Plate I and the remaining 17 on Plate II. The wbole of the document is in an excellent state of preservation. The characters are Nagarl. The language is metrical Sanskrit in the first eleven and last eleven lines which contain respectively the usual genealogy of the G-a"Jaa4ava"la kings of Kanauj and the imprecatory and benedictory verses. The remaining fourteen lilies as well as part of the last or 36th line are in Sanskrit prose and represent the formal historical portionof the document. 
The inscription records that on Tuesday1 the Bih tithi of the bright half of Jyeshtha of [V,]S. 1176 (A.D. 1119-20) after bathing in the Ganges at his camp-residence (yna~vasa) at the village of MamdaliS, belonging to Alamvimahapura, the "Gahadavala king Qovindachandra grantedthe village of VadagrSma2 in the Al&pa district to a Brahmana named Tultaieha-3 Sarman. This Brahmana belongedto the "Vachchha (Skt, Vatsa)-grora of Bronayanashacja. The fourth syllable of this latter name is not decipherable, but it is not impossible that it* was the name of a town or village or of some muni to whom (a branch of Ed.) the Fatsa-</otfra owed its origin. If this assumptionis correct, we may without hesitation identifythis locality with the villageat which the plates were found and which is still called Bon Buzurg, or the Holy D3n. It is interestingto note here a legend which describes a small cultivated area in the neighbourhoodof this village as Dr5na-ka*ghar or DrSnar-ka-garh,that is the residence or citadel of Dr5na, the preceptorof the Kaurava and Pandava princes.It is stated by the villagers that Drdna resided at this place and was on one occasion transported to Lanka to prescribe medicine for Vibhlshana, brother of Bavana, The storyis not worth much, bat it shows atlea'st that the local pandits already recognizein the name Ddn a corruption of Drdna, probably a remnant of the original long name of the place. 
At the time of issuing the grant, the king GOvindachandra was encampedat a village named Majhdalia, which was situated in AlamvimahSpura. The latter was probablythe name of the district in which the village in question was situated, and it is evident that the village stood somewhere on the banks of the Ganges.I am as yet unable to identifyeither of these places. The village granted was ap#a&a-*5-Va4agrftniawhich I interpretas Vadagrama together with its outlying hamlet and its corners: This village was situated in the district (paMala) of Alapa,

No 24 CHHATAEPUB COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTION OF GOVINDACHANDRA DEVA OF KAJSTAUJ-: [VIKRAMA]-SAMVAf 1177. BY DATA EAM SAHNI, M.A., RAI BAHADUR. 
The copper-plates on which this inscriptionis engraved are two in number. They were forwardedto the Director- General of Archaeologyin India by tne District Magistrate of Cawn pore with the following information about the circumstances that led to their discorery :" The plates were discovered on or about the 5th July, 1920, by one Chhatiyan Chamg-r when digging the foundations for a hut. Local rumour has it that he found with it jewellery and gold orna ments, but of this I have no corroboration. No one has claimed the plafces or any knowledge of their 'antecedents- The site was the village of Chfcatarpur near Sheorajpur, a small town, lying on the Grand Trunk Road, 21 miles north-west of Cawnpore. Sheorajpur was formerly a place of some importance: the seat of the Rajasof Chandel family. Chhatarpnr itself contains a very oldjfcemple of Khereshwar2 Mahadeo which ,is regarded with the greatest veneration." The plates were in a much corroded state when they reached the office of the Director- General of Archaeologyin India, who had them thoroughlycleaned and sent to me for publication in thi Journal. 
.Both ttie plates on which this inscriptionis engraved, are rectangnUr in shape, each measuring l'-3|" by 10*. Their edges are turned upwards,thus fawning a rim, -|" high, on all sides. The plates are held together by a stout circular ring of copper which passes through two holes cut in the bottom of plate I, and the top of plate II, respectively. To the ringis attached, as is frequently the case with such plates, a heavy seal of the king bearing the inscription gwmad-Govindachdndradevah with a figweof Garuda above it and a conch below it. The plates, the ring and the seal are in a perfectstate of preservation, except one corner of plate II and- another of plate I, which are slightly damaged;but we find no loss of the inscription out this account. The epigraph, which consists of thirty-two lines, is engraved on the inner side of each of the two plates, the number of lines on each plate being sixteen. The characters are Na garl and the language is Sanskrit throughout. In respectof orthography, "* e observe the same peculiarities as in other inscriptions of this king. The letter ba is everywhere written as v& and the palatals' as the dental sibilant, though occasionallyit has its own proper sign, especially in 
1 This word means a icrilje, i.e.*one who has to do with documents'(Parana). Mr. Y. E. Gnpte has kindljy drawn my attention to the fact that certain families among1 the Chandraseniya KSyastha Prabtms (a class of Writers in the Deccati) to this day hear the snrname of Karnika (Sansktit fcaranifca). Tbe Prabims referred to are supposed to have migrated from the district of Oucih in the United Provinces.

The first ten lines and a half are in verse and contain, as ,in other coppers-plate inscriptions of this dynasty, the genealogy of the king "beginning from Cliandradeva, while the nine lines at the end (11. 24-32) are taken up by seven benedictory and imprecatory verses quoted from the Mah&bh&rata. The rest of the insciiption, i.e., from the middle of line -11 to line 24, and the latter portionof line 32, is devoted to the formal subject matter of the epigraph. The object cff. the document is to record the fact that king Govindach.andradeva9 son of the illustrious 
Madanapaiadeva, son of the illustrious CtiandradSva, after bathing with the water of the Ganges at VSr&nasi on the occasion of the fulls moon of K&rtika iu the [Vikrama]-Samvat year 1177, after having duly propitiated the sacred4texts, divinities, etc., and adored the Sun, Mahadeva and "VHsudeva, gave away, "by this charter, the villageof Sasaimaua in the K6ti district, clearly defined by its four boundaries, together with what is above and below it, to the Brahman, the illustrious SSliulasarman, the son of the illustrious Thahkura Lahula, and the grandson of Avasthl-rS-Malhe whose pravaras are Angirasa, Barhaspatya and Bharadvaja, and who belongs to the Bharadvaja-g^ira. The king further commands the residents of the aforesaid village to continue regularly to pay all the taxes to the donee. The document was written by th.e Karayika Thakkura Sridhara. 
Tlie name of the village, whose grantis recorded in this inscription, was Sasaimaua. The locality, where the two copper-plates were unearthed, was, as mentioned above, the village of Chliatarpurnear Sheorajpur in Cawnpore district. I Ghhatarpur is really the place where the donee of the grant actually resided, then the village of Sasaimaua muat have been situated some where in its neighbourhood.I have referred to a large scale map of the Cawnpore district, but have failed to discern any village of this precise name. I have, ^however,received a copy of a letter from the District Magistrate to the address of the Diiector-General of Archeology im India, which states that there is a village of the name of Sisamau, which now forms part of the Cawnpore City. This village answers very nearlyto the ancient village Sasaimaua. The District Magistrateis unable to throw any light on the ancient district of Ko"ti.

*, a villageclose to the Phirangipuram Railway Station in the Guntur District' He describes them as follows : 
"Five plates with raised rims. The first and the last have writing on their inner sides only. The plates measure 9J* by 4J*. They are held together by a circular copper ring which mea sures 5f*in diameter and 2" in thickness. The ends of the ringare fixed into the bottom ol a seal whose base is "fashioned into a lotus of eight petals. The seal, which is circular, measures Sf"in diameter and bears, within a countersunk surface, the figureof a running boar facing the proper left, with a chaun in front of it. Below the boar is the legend ^ri-Trilhuv(zn[dmyc[u^a in old Telugu characters, and below it a lotus flower of eight petals spread out, with the sun and an anku$a to the right, and the crescent of the moon to the left. The ring had not yet been cut when the plates were received from the Collector of Guntur. The plates and seal together weigh 410 tolas." 
The writing cm the platesis in a state of good preservation, with the exception of portions of plate iv, 6. The alphabet is Telugu, and the language is Sanskrit prose, interspersed with 19| Sanskrit verses. The descriptionof the boundaries of two fields in lines 59-63 is in a mixture of Sanskrit and Telugu.1 The writer seems to have possesseda very superficial knowledge of the former language. As the notes on the text will show, he has committed an inordinate number of mistakes and omissions in copying the historical introduction from the records of his office. I shall not waste space and time by lengthy remarks on the orthography of this document. The upadhmdmya is represented by the Telugu symbol f in line 8, and by p at the beginningof line 67. The Sanskrit word rdshtra is speltraltra and raltra in line 48. 
The inscription on the plates records a grantof land by the Eastern Qaalukya king Am marftja II, and opens with a historical account of his ancestors which is nearly identical with the one givenin the Maliyapun<Ji grant. As I have already discussed this genealogical portion elsewhere,2 1 need note here only the corruptverse 1 (line 11), according to which it remains doubtful whether the reign of Vijayaditya II, surnamed Narendramrigaraja, was believed to have lasted either 48 or only 40 years.3 
Verses 9-15 seem to have been composed by a Brahmana named BlmttagiugMja (1. 73) and do not reflect much credit on this panegyrist as a grammarian and poet. Verse 9 states that Amma II was the son of Bhima (II), the grandson (in reality, the great-grandson)of BMma (I), and the great-grandson (in reality, the grandson of the grandson)of Vikrama&ka. The same verse alludes to the attack made by Vallabha, i.e. the Eashtrakuta king Kpshna II,4 on Bhima I. It impliesthat Bhima I bore the surname ^itasiddM,6 *wad that Vikramanka (i.e. Vikramaditya I) had received the dignityof heir- apparent, but did not ascend the throne.8 Verse 13 informs us tiiat Amma II was eight years old when he was anointed to the dignityof heir-apparent, and that he was twelve years old at the time of his coronation. From other grants the exact date of the last is known to have been Friday, 5th December, A.D. 945, in the twelfth yearof his 
age.' 
The regnal year of Amma II in which the grant recorded in the Vemalurpadu plates was made, is not specifiedin them. On the day of a winter-solstice (uttarayaq,a, I 5% the

king gave an agraMra (II 45 and 57) or many (L 71) to a Brahmana named Musiya (11. 39 and 51) or MusiyanaSarman (L 56), whose lather seem to have enjoyed the complimentary title of Maharaja (L 39 if.)* whose grandfathers name was Gtaipgamayya (L 41 1>, and who be longed to the Bharadvaja-g^m (11. 42 and 56)* The king did this at the request of Dnr&arSja, the great-grandsonof PS[n<J.a]ra&g.a (L 43 f.). Durgaraja seems to have been the royal superin tendent of the district (raya~vuhay-Sdhy<J!k$ik&>1. 53) or feudatory chief of the province1 of Karma-rasfctra (I 48) "and to have eommunicated the king's decision to the inhabitants of this district and to the donee himself, who is addressed in the second person (tvam) in lines 39 and 61. Durgaraja may be meant also bye the famous chief of the camp' who was the executor (wjfiapti) of this grant (L 72). From the king's own words, which are quoted in line 44 f., we may conclude that the donee, Musiya, was Durgaraja's minister (mantrin). Both Durgaraja and Ms great-grandfather, the general Fandaringa, are well knowm from other inscriptions.2 
The object of the grant were two fields which had been cut off from the two villages of (11. 52 and 59) and A?4*ki (L 54) in the district of Karma-rasMra (L 48). This district must have correspondedto portions of the Ongole Taluk of the NFellore District. For, it included the villageof Chendaltr In this taluk8 and the two villages of Dharmapuiram and Kalvakuru in the Addanki Division of the Ongole Taluk.4 Andeki (L 54) is perhaps an old form of the name of Addanki itself. In the absence of local maps I am unable to trace the foil*? villages which formed the boundaries of the subjoined grant (11. 57-59) The two villages of Karamcitedu (L 55) and Va&giparu (I. 73) where the recipient and the composerof the grant resided, respectively, are mentioned in a grant of Narendramiigaraja in the slightly different forms of Karanchedu and VangipayjjH..5 On sheet 3 of the Madras Presidency Map published by the Madras Survey in 1892, I find*Karanchedu/ 10 miles west by south of Bapafia ; a-nd 
Vangiparpi may be the same as Vaigipuram m the Bapatla Taluk/ which b*rclera on th Addanki Division. On the same map I notice*Nutulapad/ about 15 miles west of Bapatla. This is perhapsidentical with the village of Nutulapajia in Karma-rashtra.7

The copper-plates, which are being edited here for the first time,9 were originally lying with my brother, the late Professor Shridhar Ranxkrishna Bhandarkar, Elphinstone College^ Bombay, They were originally discovered, so I was told by Mm, at Sa&jSn in the TliaijtS District; Bombay Presidency, and were- forwarded to him for decipherment "by a Pare!

inlet but professes to be a mere copyof a copper-plate charter of his, prepared about the middle of the 12th century AJX 
The plates are three in number, each about 18J* long and 10f*broad. The edges of them all are fashioned slightly thicker, so as to serve as rims for\the protectionof writing. The record Is inscribed on the inner side of the first and third plates and on both sides of the second. The plates are strung together by a stout elliptical ring of about 4f" and 3$" in diameter and of about |";in thickness, passing throughholes on one side of each plate. The ring was intact when the plates were examined* The ends of the ring are soldered into a roughly square seal* which measures If^in height and breadth, and ^ears, in relief, on a counter- sunk surface, as the principal figure, an image of Garu4a> on a lotus seat facingfull front, with his prominent beak nose and holding a snake in each hand. Two discs are seen above the ears of Garuda, but it is difficult to say what they represent. On Garada's proper right, there is a representation of Gaijapati in the upper corner, and lower down an indistinct chauri and a lamp. OnMs lefts near the top is some goddess, standing in front of an animal (perhaps a lion) and holding a ladle in her right hand ; below her is a ohaun, and, near the bottom, a Swastika.* Beneath the central figure are in relief the letters : $Timad~Amdgh&varshadevasya. 
The engravingis clear and on the whole well-executed, but the record is full of inaccuracies due chiefly to the incorrect draft written by the scribe on the plates. The character agree fully with those of other Rashtrakufca records of the period. The langtaag is Sanskrit throughout. Excepting the introductory" 0m Svasti," the inscriptionis in verse down to line 5*7 (Third Plate). 
As regards metrology attention may be drawn to verses 23 and 39* The metre of these is Mattfi bhavikndita, which is not found in classical literature.2 It is not noticed in the Sutras of Pingala* Vfittaratnakara or Chhandfaiaftjari, but is described in the Chhandomanjan-paritiishta as *a bka-ran-man g4a-gas*tray8^a-yatir*M$^'As regards orthography I might say that (1) v is almost invariably written for 6; (2) a consonant is invariably doubled after r, in the case of y, n, ts *m, dl, n, p, A, and also v when not followed by y (of. nirvyapSfahati*in I 7), bmt not- always in the case of grand j (ct Earahafa^vinirggata in L 60 and y&!rjjan& in 1, 20, but w- *Aaya-wnwotoinl.

of Ms paper that"the genealogy was concocted gome time after the date which is recorded in this inscription, and has not been copied from a genuine copper-plate chatter of Amoghavarsha I.'* The same view he sets forth more clearly at the end of that paper."Stating distinctly what I have indicated above/' says he,"I consider it possible that lines 1-59 of this inscription really were based on a copper-plate charter;at the same time, I feel certain that, if such was the case,, the transcribers have taken so great liberties with the original as to deprivethis*copy*of the value of an authentic document." The present plates, however, eDable us to decide howfat Kielhorn's opinion is correct. A comparison of lines 1-14 of the Konnui Inscription with the genealogical portion of these plates leaves no doubt as to the lines 1-59 of the former being copied on stone from a genuine charter of Amoghavarsha I, as the concluding partof it informs us. But what about the glaring blunders in the genealogy which Kielhorn has detected in the Konnur Inscription ? How did they arise ? In the first place,in our platesalso the father of Govinda I is called Prichchhakaiaja, as the same verse occurs in both the records. Prichchhakaraja may be a new name not known from previous Rashtrakuta grants, but that does not mean that it ig a fabrication* And, as a matter of fact, it rliay be another name of Indraraja who is mentioned as the father of Govinda I in the fragmentary Ellora Da&avatara cave temple inscription.1 Again, Kielhorn says that the Konnur Inscription makes Prabhutavarsha (-Govinda II) a son of his younger brother Dharavarshasand consequently Prabhutavarsha (-Govinda III) not a nephew but a son of the former. This discrepancy, flagrant though it appears, can be easily explained away by the mention of the fact that Dharavarsha-sutas of the inscriptionis a misreadingof the transcribers for the correct wording Dkarauarskas=tatas,such as that supplied by our grant, Then, again, Kielhora tells us that in the Kongaur epigraph Karkaraja IJscalled Karkara, an apparently later form of the name. Here, also, the transcribers must have read Karkleara-prabhufa wrongly in placeof KarJckardt prabhufy as appearsin our grant. And it can scarcely be disputed that Karkkarat is precisely the same word as Karkkaraja. This name occurs in v. 4 of the Konnui record* which, however, begins with Imdr-dvampala-sutenadhari'til instead of dhanus-saanutsarita bkubkrita mahl as in our plates. This discrepancyalone is of a serious character aa it makes Indra not a son but father of Karkkaraja. It is, however, possible to get over this difficulty by taking Imdr-avampala-sutena as a bahuvnhi compound. In this connection we have to bear in mind the fact that of all the verses common to the Konnur Inscription and OUT charter* this is the only stanza where one whole line is entirelydifferent. Was it deliberately composed and inserted or is it an example of sheer carelessness ? If the introductory portionof the former is compared to that of the latter, it will be seen that the former, as it were of set purpose, wants to bring the genealogical account into the narrowest possible compass.This is quite clear from the fact that verses 12 and 27 of our charter, which are the same as verses 8 and 9 of the Konnur Inscription, are connected with each other in the latter record by the two words : ,tasya autah. It is not impossible that the transcribers are responsiblefor this abridgement as th<iir main object must be to give in full only those details that relate to the grant proper and curtail them rigorously in all other respects. And it is not inconceivable that in their zeal to epitomize the genealogy they may have coined the line Imdr-avampata sutena dhdriyi, which if we take it to be a tahuvrihi compound, can he made to yield the sense that Indra was the son of Karkkaraja, and can thus make one verse serve the purpose of two,

the prosperous Jagattungadeva. It records that in the Saka year 793 when Am5ghavarsha was staying at Manyakteta, his capital, he granted to four Brahnaans the villageof Jhari yaUika from the Twenty-four- village Group adjacent to Samjana for the purpose of maintain ing the bali, charu, vaisvadeoa, agnihstra and attihitarpaqa sacrifices. The donees are all Brahmans of the Bahvrieha-^Ma. Two of them, namely, (1) Narasimha-Dlkshita, son of Gola Shadangavid and grandson of Savikuvara, and (SJJRakshaditya-Kramavid, son of Govinda-Bhatta and grandson of Bhatta, were of the Bharadvaja-.^m. The third, Trivikrama-Shadangavid, aon of Vishnu- Bhatta, grandson of Davadi-Gahiyasahasa, belongedto the Vaddamukha-y&w ; and the fourth and last, Kesava-Gahiyasahasa, son of Govaditya-Bhatta and grandsonof Hari-Bhatta, was of the Vatsa-gdtra. They all hailed from the same district, namely, Karahada. They were probably the Karhada Brahmans. 
Having thus disposed of the formal part of the grant, we shall now see what historical in formation can be gleaned from the introductory metrical portion, which sets forth -the genealogy. After the introductory Om, it opens with the well-known invocatory verse with which most of the Rashtrakuta records begin. The next verse is in praiseof Vlra-Narayana, by whom is here to be understood not only the god Narayana, the originator of the Rashtrakuta family, but also Amoghavarsha, the Rashtrakuta king, the donor of the grant, who bore that epithet. In verse 3 we are told that in the line of the Yadus there was a king Govinda, eon of Priohchhaka 
raja. This Govinda is, of course, Govinda I of the Rashtrakuta dynasty of Manyakheta-. He was succeeded by Karkka, on whom nothing but conventional praise is bestowed in vv. 4-6. Verse 7 says that after him came Indraraja, who married the daughter of a Chalukya king at Khetaka by the Rakshasa form of marriage. This clearly shows that the Rashtra ku$ae, in the time of Indraraja, came first into hostile contact with the Chalukyas not of the Dekkan but of Gujarat, for the seat of this Chalukya power is mentioned as Khetaka, the same as Kair in North Gujarat. These Chalukyas must, therefore, be the Gujarat branch of the maindynasty ruling at Badami. In this connection is worth noting the Introli-ChharolI (in Surat) copper-plate grant of Kakka, dated gaka 679=A.D. 757.* This record inentions-(l) aRashtrakuta prince named Karkka, (2) his son, Dhruva, (3) hia son, Govinda, and (4) his son, Kaikka II, with whose name are coupled the titles MaharajadUraja, Paramttvara and Parama bliattaraJca, One feels exceedingly tempted to say that the third and fourth of these princes are identical with their namesakes who preceded Indraraja, fatiier of Dantidurga. One is, however, confronted with the difficulty that whereas under this supposition we have the date gaka 679 for Karkka, we have Saka 675 for his grandson, Dantidurga, supplied by his Satnangadh charter. This difficulty, however, is not insuperable, because there are reasons to doubt the genuine ness of this last record. That the portion of it relating to the details of the village granted has been tampered with was pointed out long ago by Dr. Meet when he edited the inscrip tion.* And the authenticity of the record as a whole has recently been called in question by Dr. V. S. Sukthankar on pateographic grounds." Thus the date furnished by the Samangadkgrant 1% not above doubt, and the identification just pointed out may hold good. We maythus toke it that before the time of Dantidurga his predecessors were occupying South Gujarat. 
'Verse 8 tells us that Indraraja was succeeded by Dantidurga, of whom the next verse says that when in Ujjain the various Kshatriyas performed the ceremony, namely, the Great Orrft o* Hiranyagarbha, he made the Gurjara and other lords his door-keepers (fratikdra). 
verse evidently means in the first place that Dantidurga either performed, himself or took a 1 R Kielhotii's Lii of Inscriptions of Southern India, No. 54.

prominent partin this Hira^yagarbha ceremony in Ujjain. And this receives confirmation from a stanza ^occurringin the Da^avatara cave temple inscription at Eiiora.1 This inscription gives MahSraja-Sarira as another name apparently for Dantidurga, and claims that in that very Ujjain, in order to enjoy a diversion with other princes, he instituted a maM-dana worthyof 
kings, and poutedall kinds of wealth and precious stones on the supplicants. There can, therefore, be no doubt that Dantidurga had gone to Ujjain and performed the Hixa^yagarbha ceremony, Secondly, verse 9 of out grant also implies that at Ujjain was then ruling a Otirjara dynasty called Pratlhara* There can be little doubt that this must be the Piatihttai dynasty,that became supreriie after seizing the throne of Mahodaya. We know for certain fw>ni epigraphic records that their capital became MahSdaya or Kanauj from the time of Bhoja I onwards. But we did not know with certitude where they were actually ruling before they became rulers of Kanauj. And it was a mere surmise when some scholars thought that it was BMlmal or Bhinmal in South Rajputana.2 Our grant, however, enables us now to say definitely that their original seat of power was Ujjain,It also enables us to interpret ptoperly the third lini of the stanza so often quoted from the Jaina Hwivam&a of Jinasena. We can have no doubt now as to the correctness of Dr. Fleet's translation,3 which makes Vatsaiaja kingof Avanti; This Vatsaraja,, of course, is the Vatsaraja of the ImperialPratihara dynasty, and the Jaitm Hcuriv&mia may be regarded as strengtheningthe inference that the Pratiharas were estab lished at Ujjain and. not Bhilmai before they transferred their capital to Kanauj. Danti durga was succeeded by SubliatuAga Vallabha (v. 10) ,that is, Krishipa I, who is re presented to have seized the Chaiukya sovereignty.- He was followed by Prabhiktavarslia, 'that is, Gdirinda II, and the latter by Dharavarslia, that is, Dferuva (v. 12). -Verse 13 contains BO historical information, but the verse following says that.Dhruva anatcbed away the royal parasols of the kingof Gauga as he was fleeing between the Ganges and the Jumna. This 6an4a Mag, who would be a contemporary of Dhruva, is either Dharmapala or his father Gropalaj of the PHa dynasty. From the inscriptionsof this family, however, Gopala does not seem to have been in any way a powerful prince ; and we must, therefore, suppose that Dhar mapala was the Gau$a prince defeated by Dhruva. But the curious thing about this victoryis that he was defeated not in his own country but outside.* Does this not show that the Oang* prince had goneoutside his dominions, perhaps,to helpthe kingof Kanauj ? This agrees witk the fact, mentioned in the Baroda plates, that Dhxuva seized the territory between the Gauge* and the Jumna and thus added the emblems of the two rivers to his imperial insignia* This territory certainly coincides with the Kanauj kingdom, and what appearsto have happened is that when, after defeating Vatsaraja, Dhruva was pressinghis victories northwards, the Gaiuja king must have made common cause with the Kanauj sovereign,butthat9when the Eishtrakiifa prince inflicted a crushing defeat on the' latter, he beganto purwe the former and encountered him before he was able to reach his dominions. Verse 15 says that Dhruva's feme, which hai already spreadas far as the extremities of the earth, now extended to the heavens, implying that he died. The next verse furnishes Nirapama as an epithetof Dkruva, and telis us that, a* soon as Ms BOH Govinda III was crowned king, he re-instated some of the feudatories in t^eir 
own principalities, and, apparently againstthe wishes of his councillors, in particular, related the G-suiga prince, who, as we know from the records, was imprisoned by his father. This move

wa^a]^ disaffection among the vassal kings who tad transferred their allegiance from Mm to another overlord (v. 17), This is evidentlya reference to his contending, immediately after Ms accession, againsta confederacyof twelve kings led by Stambha, who can 
be no other than Ms elder brother Kanavaloka-Kambhadeva.1 This opposition, however, he quickly put down. But the Ganga, whom he L*d released, refused to pay the fine imposed on him and had to be putin fetters again (v* 18), 
Verses 19-20 contain nothing but conventional praise of Govinda III, but the second of these supplies for Mm 'a new epithet Tribhuvanadhavala, not known from previousrecords. From v, 21 "begins the description of his expeditionof conquestin the north. He appearsfirst to liave encountered and defeated Nagab&ata and Ghandragupta. Who the second of these princes was it is not difficult to say. The only princeof that name who can be a con temporary of Govinda III is Chandragupta .of the K56ala country ruling at Sripura or Sirpur in the Central Provinces.2 The name of the familyto which he belonged was Pandava, but there can be no doubt that it was one of the paramount dynastiesof the eighth and ninth - centuries. As regards Nagabhata* the other prince vanquished by Govinda III, there can be no question that he pertained to the Imperial Pratlhara family and was the son of Vatsaraja, king of Avantl, referred to above. His victorious march in the north, as verse 23 tells us, continued till Mshorses drank and elephants plunged themselves into the spring waters of the Himalayas. Andit was here that two more princes, XXharma and ChakrSyudha, seem to have offered him their submission. This verse winds up by saying that he thus resembled the Himalayas in Mrti or fame, and, therefore, came to be known as Klrtin5rayaria, which, we know, was another epithet of Govinda III Of the two kings who submitted to him as he approached the Himalayas, Dharma has been recognised to be Dharmapala of the Pala dynasty, andChakrayudha to be the prince of the same name who obtained the sovereignty of Kanauj through Dharmapala.3 
From the Himalayas Govinda III returned to the Narmada ; and, turning to the easttfhe along the bank of the river, conquering the Malava, KSsiala, Kalinga, Vanga, Pabalaand O^raka countries (v. 24), and in this connection we are informed of another title that he bow, gamely, Vikrama, Making his enemies submissive, he followed the' other m part of the

Veise 29 makes mention of the two titles which were borne by GSvinda HI, namely, Pra febtttavarsha and Jagatttifiga ; and the two verses following inform us that from this encamp ment in the Vindhyas he afterwards set out to attack and humble the Draviqb kings. Whothese Dravida kin'gs were is made clear in verse 32, and it appearsthat in this expeditionto the south he vanquishedthe Keraja3 Pa^dya, Chaulika (Choja) and Pallava* With these are also coupled in the same verse the rulers of Kalinga and Magadha and the (jurjara to show that he was rightfully styled Vikrama, Then we are told that, presumablyin this excursion, he chained and put to death certain G-anga princes who had become disaffected (v. 33). They apparently do not include the Ganga ruler referred to in verse 18 above, and probably belongedto more than one Ganga family. Which these were exactly it is difficult to say. One of these was certainly the Western Ganga dynasty ruling over the Gangavaxji province, and the other is probably what is called the Ganga-Pallava family.1 The second half of verse 33 informs us that he made his camp ground free of dust through the lords of mawfalM by compensating them if they were friendly and by subjecting them to forced labour if they were otherwise, such as the Vengiruler was* This fact is also mentioned in the Radhanpur charter of that king. Where this camp is to be is not certain, *but it seems to be Helapura of the next verse, a place from where he is repre sented to have enforced the obedience of the king of Lanka (Ceylon) and his minister. As a result of this obedience he seems to have received two statues apparentlyof Ravaija/ its most ancient and traditional ruler, which he, however, transferred to KancM, and put up as two oolunms of 
fame before the templeof Siva. Where can this Helapurabe located? Accordingto the Eadhaa pur grant* he was then encamped either on or near the Tungabhadra, Can this Halapurabe thus Velapura or Bfllui8 in the Hassan District of the MysoreState 
Verses 35-36 speak of the death of Govinda III and the accession of Ms SOB, Amdglmvaraha* to sovereignty. The subsequentfour verses inform us that just when Amoghavsrsha

was the family deityof at least one branch of the SilanSra race* It is possible Amoghavarsha made a gift of his finger as 'bali to Mahalakahml of 
to avert some calamity which threatened his kingdom.Verse 48 compares Mmto a Gupta kingin pointof generosity and decides in favour of the former. The Gupta prince was no doubt traditionally handed down as a donor, but he had stigmatizedhis carfeer by killinghis own brother^ seizing the latter's kingdom and queen, and wresting heavy sums from her. Amdghavarsha, on the other hand* pantedneither for kingdom nor for self, and freely gave themaway several times* The latter point reminds us of the PraSnottararatnamaUka* the DigambaraJaina copies of which inform us that the work was composed by Amoghavarsha**after he hadabdicated the throne in consequenceof the growthof the ascetic spirit in him."1 And it is quite possible that the figureof a royal ascetic found in a natural cavern2 at Badami may represent this Amoghavarsha, But this was nothing more than a surmise, as the other copiesof the work omitted all mention of the BashtrakSta sovereign. But our plates now clearly show that Amogha varaha abdicated his throne, not once but more than once, before Saka 793 (=A.D. 871), the date of the charter^ when, however, he was carrying on his kingly duties. This shows that a king could in ancient times temporarily resign his sovereignty and enjoy the life of a hermit or ascetic. Butwho was the Gupta prinoe who was noted for his liberality up till the 9th century and who sinks into insignificancy by comparison with" Amoghavarsha ? The'Gatha-saptaiati of Hala who is ascribed to the beginning of the sixth century3 and the Vasavadatta of Subandhu who has been placed in the century butat its closes for the first time speakof a king called Vikramaditya renowned for his gen^osity, Aad it has been suspected that this Vikramaditya is either Chandra gupta II or Skandagupta., both of the Imperial Gupta dynasty.4 Of the formej, there is no record to lead us even to surmise that i^e ousted his brother aiyl usurped the throne. In the case of Skandagupta, however, the Bhftafl! Pillar Inscription says that when his father (Kumaragiipta I) died, the sovereignty of the femily was tottering but that he put down his enemies and thereafter vent to see his mother Jurt a$ Krishnadid DevakI, The ^efe^ence to Ejishga *od Dv*Jtt indi cates that this was a femily feud and tkat his enemies jn the present oase we^e his kfeamen.* Weftlso further that Sfemdagupta had a brother nam$d GhatStka.chagupta who was in charge 
trf the Era^ district vhen Kw&fagupta I was alive.6 A seal of Ghat&tkaohagupte was also found in BasSrh (a*efeitf Vai&aii)? which was fte seat o| the Tuvwaja during the Gupta rule. It appeara probable tiiat there w^s a fyatticidal war between Ghat5tkachagupta and Skandagupta in which the former w^s kQled aod the throne sekedby the latter. |t may not, therefore, be mueaBonable to hold that Skandagupta-Vikramaditya was the Gupta king alluded to in our chatter vat comparison to Amoghavaisha,

(Vs. 4-6). Then came lord Karkar&t, who bore an expansivechest with the rays of the Kaustizbha jewel throbbing like Meru which bears golden slope spreadall over with lustre emit ting from the morning sun ; full of fear for whom were constantly the minds of the enemies, proclaimers of whose fame were (their) words, bent at whose feet we?e (their) feeads, and lost ,in whose lustre was (their) glory ; by whom possessing the power of Prithu the moM (the domi 
nions, the earth) was widened, the bhubhrits (the kings, the mountains) were pushed back by the bow, and by whom of great Sjas (might, splendour) and of pratapa (valour, scorching heat) was. dispelled the darkness, namely, the enemies. 
(V.. 7). Then (came) Indraraja, who in the (marriage) hall, namely, Kfaetaka, seized ia battle the daughter of the Chaiukya king by the rakghasa (form of) marriage. (V. 8). Then flourished on the earth king Dantidurga^ the chief of his family3 who smote hosts of elephants and humbled the circle of proud kings from the Himalayas down to the Emit of the Sgtu, 
(V. 9). By whom kings such as the Gurjara lord and others weice mad^ door-keepera when in Ujjayinl the (Great Gift called) Hiranya-garbha was completed by the Kshatriyas,1 (V. 10). Then in the battle field which proveda (place) of choice marriage, S-utbhatuAga^ Yallabha listlessly and forcibly wrested away the Fortune of the Chalukya family, bearing the garland, namely, the waving Palidhvajas.* 
(V. 11). Though elevated by means of incontestable throne and chowries, possessedof a white umbreHa and enjoying a kingdom without any rival, AkSlavarslia, who destroyed Mng& andl ehieftains, was a royal sage, a doer of unending holy acts*. 
(V. 12). Then Prabhatavarsl^ became (king),, and thereafter DfaarSvarslaa, by which king was rained down, as it were, a shower with arrows on the battle field* 
(V. 13). That (low) deep sound of whose drum is, as it were, the satiated Death belching out* (who is) intoxicated with potations of tasteful liquor, namely, the slightly warm blood from the enemies9 heads cut off by his sword in battles and (who is) (now) with stomach filled to the throat. 
(V* 14). Who aeked the white umbrellas, the sporting lotuses of the Lakshml (Goddess of Sovereignty), ef the Gauda king, as he was $eei&g between the Ganges and the Jumna,. (V* 15), Whose fame, white as the rays of the moon, having pervadedto the end of th.e earth @n aU sides, (amd) having as it were uninterruptedly crossed to the other shore of the ocean in the shape of numbers of moving conches, hundreds of pearls, ^apJiara fish, and waves with n(ianifold foaon, reached iieaven under tlie semblance o| the necklaces and elephantsof the gods, the heavenly river, and the dkartarasUra (swan).

(Y- 1TX Quickly fighting in battle and capturing all his wicked vassals like great bulls, extremely uncontrollable and fierce, that had snapped (his noose) but had those of other iorda cast over them, and releasing them when thir spirit $f defection ended, he, with his hearfc softened, harboured them as the ocean does the submarine fire.

(V. 18). By whom when the ungrateful Ganga was disaffected in consequence of fleeing away from, the fine ordered by him, that villain, who had been freed from fetters on the feet, had (now) fetters put round his neck. 
(V. 19). Who was the illustrious Mandhatii, another viceroy of the Creator, in as much as he with his lotus-like feet touched by the matora-shaped crowns of the lords of the earth, exerted himself to protect the earth, which had as the essence of (her) royalty the line of the Rasfatra kutas, which was charming in consequence of beautiful women, and towns and villages that were delightful, extensive and possessed of gardens, and which had for (her) girdle the ocean yesounding clearly with (its) expansive waters. 
(V. 20). Who, deafening the intervals between all the quarters with the noise of the deep sounding drums, the sound of which was as loud as that of a new cloud, and with (his) (Lhakkti** "kahalas, and the loud tnryas sounding shrill, is death to the busy time of the enemies of Tribhu vana-dliavala- 
(V. 21). Who, moreover, being an unbearable store of lustre, was the Sun himself gone into the Uttar-dya^a (the north; the northern partof the elliptic), bringing his pada (feet ; rays) to gtretch on the murdhans (heads ; tops)of bhubhrits (kings ; mountains), being of auspicious rise, covering the intervals between all the quarters with his lustre, getting at every stepincrease of pratapa (valour ; heat), having an anurakta (devoted ; red) matydala (feudatories ; disc) and 
being paimakar-anandita (gladdened by the hand of the goddess of sovereignty; gladdening the assemblageof lotuses). 
(V- 22). Carrying away in battles the fair and unshakable fame of kings Nagabiiata and Gb^mdragupta,, he, intent upon the acquisitionof fame, uprooted,like rfoKcorn, other kings, in their own dominions, who had become destitute of all fortitude, and afterwards re-instated them in their own places. 
{V. 23). The water of the springsof the Himalaya mountains was drunk by whose horses and plunged into by whose elephants, the thunder was redoubled in (its) caverns by the turya musical instruments of (whose) ablutions, (and)to whom, the great one, those (kings) Dliarma and Ghakr&yudtoia surrendered of themselves. He thus bore resemblance to the fame of Himalaya,, and was consequently mrti-N&r&ya^a. 
(V. 24). Who returned from there, (thinking) that it was now the work of the ministerial servants, and following againthe bank of the Narmada as if (followinghis own) prowess, and acquiring the MHIava country along with the K6sala, the Kalinga, the Vanga,* theDafcala, and the Oclraka, that Vikrama himself made his servants enjoy them.

(V 27) At the time of whose birth it was foretold by astrologers that'beingirresistible he would enjoy the earth bounded by the Himalayas and the Setu, and girdled by the oeean ; (V 28)"Of the warriors, (his) enemies, those that were bound down in battle by Amogha- ^arsha would be released, but, if disaffected, there would be release from fetters only by being ashes^^ ^Prab]llltavarsha, as he satisfied the desires of those that were his own.

(V. 31)* By whose mere setting out, the clear undivided earth shakes, being shabbily covered by the instruments of his valour. Lakshmi too moves away, displeased, from^the breasts of the enemies who hate him intensely,like a creeper pulled out by the wind. It is not the dust that has flown away to the quarters, but the loom that extended the fame of his enemies. 
(V. 32), He terrified the Kerala, Pa^4ya and Ghaulika kings, caused the sprouting Pallava to wither, was the afflictor who caused the Kalinga and the Magadfca to sit and fast themselves to death,1 was destruction to the valour of the head of the thundering Gurjjaras (and thus) behaved (like Rama), enemy of Lanka;2 (and as he) got its unimpeachableorders carried out assiduously, he was Vikrama of laudable valour. 
(V. 33). The Gangas, who became disaffected through baseness, were bound down with fetters and met with death. The lords of ma^alas, who were friendly, made his camp ground along with the enclosure, free of dust by wage, but the lord of Veiiigi and others by unpaid labour. 
(V. 34). By whom having forcibly by (his chastising) rod controlled, like dumb and deaf persons, the king and the prime-minister, ruined through laziness in working for their good, (and) having brought to Helapura from Laihka two statues of its lord, these, having afterwards proceeded to KificM, were established there in the temple of Siva like two columns of fame. 
(V 35)."(My) fame has occupiedthe three worlds, and my unique son is able to bear the burden of his world/* so (thinking) he made his life fruitful through various religiousacts."For doing what should I stay in this (world) ?'*so saying Anupama followed (his) fame, while going to the lofty palace, namely, heaven, to which spotless fame and holymerit formed the 
steps* 
(V. 36). In order to protect the fame (along with the subjects) of the ancestors in his worthy family, and of his pleasing relatives, who were the Vallabhas of the peoples, and who were nowliving in -the form of (their) good fame which filled up the world, and in order (thus) to destroy the fiinfulness of Kali, there rules the prosperous Amfigliavarslia, sitting on the lion-throne, the exterminator of enemies, whose deeds are praised by the wise. 
(V* 37). In front of the palace of whom, the destroyerof the impurityof Kali, (as in front of that) of India, sounds incessantly the deep rumbling sound of loud-sounding $iakk& and other (infltntmenta), soaring Ugh with, the import :"there is no other lord of the earth like this one, able to protect the humble, to conquer enemies at the front of the battle, to make gifts to supplicants, and maintain the truthfulness of custom.95 
(V* 38). Seeing that j*ew kingdom which consisted of sixteen principalities but (seeing also) the king, the might of whose righteousness was profuse and ennobling, the crooked, deceitful Kali, distressed that it was the beginning of the Kyita Age, fleeing and penetrating, into the interior, distracted the fetMaiories, the ministers, and his relatives, who were made his own. 
(V. 39). Giving deceit-fid counsel through false oaths, they were independent of (their) lord. Of their own accord killing the appointed officers who were worthy, all seized for themselves. *Another's wife is a daughter or sister/~stich distinction there was none, as among the beasts. Tha KaH Age becoming thus supreme, good behaviour became extinct through sinful living.

(possessed of heat ; possessedof valour) (temporarily)ceases to be, for that length of time only do the vijihmas (the dismal ones ; the crooked ones) rise. 
(V* 41). Following guru and budha (the two planets of those names ;. elders and wise men), the lord, the sun of the Rattas, taking, again,his rise through the greatnessof the rising moun tain, namely, Arya PgLtSIamalla, and overpowering the unruly circle of tejasvins (luminaries ; men of fiery spirit), again, purifies the world alone, 
(V. 42). The soul is the king ; the mind is his minister ; the group of senses is again that circle of feudatories accordingto the political science ; and speech, &c., are the servants conform ing to the prescribedrules. Presiding over his place, namely, the body, he (the soul) is able to enjoy, independently,his own vishaya (kingdom ; worldly objects). When that enjoyer is subject to samnipata (a kind of fever, collision), they all perish. 
(V. 43). Who, having, with rage, destroyed the sedition- mongers that were so by regular succession from their own ancestors as does a medicine diseases, wind clouds, fire dry fuel, and the sun darkness, (and) having (thus) destroyed by fame as by moon-light the darkness of Kali from both the beginning and extremity'of the earth, he shone by the beauty of the royal parasol, white like the moon.

From the mandala (feudatories) struck by whose da$4& (chastising rod) pearls cameto his palace like fruit from a tree (struck by a stick), (and) to his palace came a host of elephants, like a herd of boars, from the forest, with mandala (temples) struck by da<$$a (stick). With the bodies consumed by the fierce fire of whose anger the enemies were reduced to ashes ; (as) others, 
with bodies favoured on account of their falling at his feet, attained to prosperity. (V. 45). Whose order the alien kings incessantly place on their head as a chapiet.

Overpoweringall the bhubhrits (kings ; mountains) with his tejas (prowess, heat) over whom is he not a very ina (king ; Sun) ?

At whose gate the lords of the hostile territories are put to trouble by relays of door-keepers, being made to sit outside, while waiting for the propertime of (his) assembly-hall, and where, when they perceive that they will not obtain back their own bevy of courtezans and group of elephants, covered with choice gems and pearls, which have gone into his possession, they droop down. 
(V. 47). That son of JimutakatK gave away his own body in order to protecta serpent ; Sibi, again, to a hawk to save a dove ; (and) Dadhicha to (his) supplicator. But they, we are told, gratified each a single individual, (whereas) the illustrious Vira-Narayana presented Msleft finger to Mah5-Lakshmi for the pacificationof a calamityto the (whole) people. 
(T. 48). That donor, in the Kali Age, who was of the Gupta lineage, having killed (his) brother, we are told, seized (his) kingdomand queen, (and) thereafter the wretch caused her to write down one lac, one crore (in the document). But he, who gave away morethan once his own kingdom, insignificant (to him), (saying):5 of what account are the external objects % was bashful even when the fame (had spread) that the ornament of the exalted Rashtrakutas was the (real) doiaor* 
(V. 49). While AmSghavarsha, whose cluster of powerful enemies are bitten by the fangs of the terrible jaw of the snake, namely, the sword in his hand, is the ruler of the earth, no (adverse) times characterised by calamities to husbandry, plagues and famines can set their foot in the Hemanta, Si^ira, Vasanta, Grishma, Va,rsha and Sarat seasons,

(V. 51). Those kings are, indeed, worthy of respect who were of the past and whose charity is to be maintained by us and others. The (kingsof the) present were wicked and had been destroyed. Those who are to be besought for (the maintenance of) our charity are kingsof the future. 
(V. 52). What consideration can there be for that unstable kingdom which is enjoyed by some through valour, passed over by some to others, and given up again by some others ? By the great a charity alone should be maintained for fame*

No. 27. KOPPARAM PLATES OF PULAKESIN II. 
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.P. ;HALLE 
Iuk4nipressionsof these copper-plates were sent to me by Rao Bahadur Krishna Sastri, who had received them from the late Mr. K. V. Lakshmana Rao, M.A., Telugu Encyclopaedia Office, Egmore, Madras. The plates had been found near Kopparam in the Narasaraopet Taluk of the Guntur District* For a descriptionof them, and for remarks on their alphabet and lan guage, see Mr. Lakshmana Rao's valuable article in the Annals of the BhandarJcar Institute, Vol. IV, p. 43 S.3 I now re- edit the inscription because I believe that I am able to improve a few of his readings and renderings. The composer of the text knew so little Sanskrit that in some places it is difficult to divine what he really wanted to express. 
The inscription records a grant made, by the Maharaja Satyasraya Pulakesi-Prithivi vallablia4(line 6 i), the"dear grandson"(1. 5) of the Maharaja Klrtwanna-PyitMvivalla bka of the Ghaltikya family (1. 4). As stated by Mr. Lakshmana Rao (loc. ci.,p. 43), priya pautra must be a stupiderror for priya-putra,"the dear son." For we know from trustworthy documents that PulakSSin II was not the grandson, but the son of Xlrtivarman I. 
The donee was a Brahmaija of the ^asidilyayana-^ra and the JLpastamba-swtf/a, whoresided &t MKigamilr (L 10)* The grant consisted of a field of eight hundred (nwartanas of land) in the village of Irbuli in (the district of) Karma-rash4ra (L 11). The field lay to the south of 1 For the expression bk&mi-chcfafaidra-nyayena, see Ind. Ant. 9 1922, pp. 77-9.

and to the north of Virpayu (L 12). For Karma-rashtffa, see above, Vol. XV,p. 250. Mr. Lakshmana Bao (loc. cit., p. 49) identifies Kondav[e]rupur with Kondavldu, and Virparu with Vipparla, both in the Narasaraopet Taluk of the Guntur District, and Mugamurwith MungamuT in the Kandukur Taluk of the Nellore District. In line 10 we are introduced to a great warrior named PjitMviduvaraJa whom Mr. Laksh mana Eao (lac, eft,, p. 46 f.) identifies with Satyasraya Dhruvaraja Indravarman of the Goaplates of &aka 532.1 I venture to propose another identification. If we connect the participle W[w*]pr<wfatt3 (1. 8) with ajfaptih (1. 14) and with its Prakrit form aiy&li* (1. 10), we are driven to consider the words -rafyaaya Pritkiiriduvarajam^aqatti (1. 9 f.) a mistake which would not be without parallelsin this incorrect text for -rajyasya Pritkimduvarajasy^Hapti^. Now,tvvaraja. is a Dravidian tadbhava of yuvaraja* If we contrast the title Prithiviyuvaraja,"the heir-apparent of the earth," with Prithivivallabha,"the husband of the earth," which was the title of Klrtivarman I and Pulakesin II; and as it is stated in line 9 f. that Prithiviyuvaraja had"secured the kingdom to the lineage of his son," it seems that Prithiviyuvaraja can be safely identified with Viah^uvardliana I, the younger brother of PulakSsin II and the founder of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty.It follows further that Visfe^uvardbana I continued to be dependent on Pulakesin II in the twenty-first year of the latter's reign (text line 13). Prom the Satara plates we already knew that he held the office of Yuvaraja in the eighth year (of Pulakesin II).* In a grant of A.D. 632, which was the 18th year of his own reign,6 and in the Timmapuramplates,6 Vishnuvardhana I already bears the title of Maharaja. 
The words 7allabha-sama[ksh]-aVa*tite (1. 8) may have to be corrected into Vallabhe samateh-- Vallabha (i.e. Pulakesin II) being present in persoru" The mysterious words marnta Kali.Manim . 8Va-bahuna (1. 8 f.) may be compared with Kaliyuga-khala mrmathanaitt*] . . .charitai^ in the Satara plates of Vishnuvardhana I, and may be corrected accordingly into maths Kali-khalanam .... sva-bahuna,"by his arm. .

POSTSCRIPT 
BY ROBERT SEWELL, LC.3. (RETIRED). 
At Dr. Hultzsch's request I have examined the date of the Chaiukya inscription published on pp. 43 to 54 of Part I, Vol. VI of the Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute which is stated to belong to"the year twenty-one of increasing victory"of a Chaiukya sovereign who is perhapsidentical with Pukke&in II. 
The details of the given date are"Thursday the mah&navami day in the month Karttika." It is not stated whether this 9th day was in the light or dark fortnight, but in the absence of this information it is reasonable to assume that the 9th day of the month was -meant, or more accurately the day on which at sunrise the 9th ukla titki of Karttika was current. If the inscription belongsto the reign of PulakeSin II it must l^ave been composedabout AJX 629 or 630, or thereabouts.

According to Cowell and Thornta (Translation of the JfrrfXacftorifa, p. 266), "the word malkarit* to denote a ma&ara-shaped forehead ornament." 
This was the iarounte surname of PnkkeAin II, See Fleet's Dyn. ofthe Kan. DiaMeU, sec. ed.f p. 351, *[See footnote 9 on the preceding page^Ed,]*[See footnote II on the preceding page. Ed.] ' The bracketed words are supplied from lism 8 and 10,
No. 27.] KOPPARAM PLATES OF PULAKESIN II. 261   
Calculation for a date of that period must be made either by the mean-system computation of the First Arya-SiddMnta, or of the Brahma-Siddhanta, which latter was compiled in A.D. 628* By either of these the 9th Sukla titki of Karttika fell in A.D. .628 on a Wednesday. In A.D. 629 it fell on Sunday by the First Arya-SiddMnta and on Monday by the Brahma-Siddhanta. In A.D. 630 it fell on Saturday by both authorities. But in A.D. 631 it fell on Thursday, by both these Siddhantas, and that Thursday corresponded to October 10 A.D. 631. This last satisfies the requirementsof the case if, in the practice of those days, the 9th 6ukla titU of Karttika marked a mahanavann day. I regret that I am unable to give an opinion on this point. The modern maJianavami day is, I understand, the day corresponding to the 9th 6nHa tithi in the month JUvina. 
If the day in question was actually Thursday October 10 A.D. 631, it makes the king's accession to have taken place on or after October 11 A.D, 610, seeing that it belongs to his 21st regnal year. 
As regardsthis date it must be noted that Fleet (Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts, p. 23) stated that Pulake&in IPs accession must* have taken place66early inSaka 532 (A.D, 610-1)" that R. G. Bhandarkar fixed it as in $aka 533, Le. A.D, 610 or 611, according as the $aka year was treated as current or expired (Early History of the Dekkan, p. 38) ; and that Professor Jouveau-Dubreuil (Ancient History of the Deccan, p. Ill) givesit as in A.D, 609* Fleet's fixture slightlyconflicts with the date October 11 A.D. 610, since the year $aka 532 began on March 19 in that year.

The stone on which this inscriptionis incised measures IT by 144", and it is now in the Lahore Musram. There is some uncertaintyabout ita provenance. Cunningham originally stated2 that it had been discovered by Dr. Bellew at ShahbazgarhL Similarly Mr. Hargreayes 
writes in a letter dated Simla---- December 1913 : **In connection with the Gandhira 10th 
sculptures I had occasion to look up references to the very well-known and frequently quoted Takht-i-Bahi inscription, and to my surprisefind tliat there is no absolute certaintyit emanates from Tt*kht-i-Babi at all, it may very well come from ShahbazgarhL" 
Liater on Cunningham speaks about the record as hailing from Takht-i-Bahl9 without mentioning his previousnote on the subjects and since that time the epigraph has always been spoken of as thee Takht-i-Bahl'inscription, 
Both placesare situated in the same neighbourhood, Shahbazgarhi 6| miles east and Takht-i-Bahi about 8 miles north-west of Mardan in YusufzaL 
According to the Editor of Tritbner's Record, June I873?Dr. Bellew had left the stone at Hoti Mardan*' in Dr. Johnson's compound.Several years afterwards, in 1870, he authorised

Dr. Leitner io take away anything he might have left at Hoti Mardan. Dr. Leitner, after personal inspection, got the stone carried down to Lahore by bullock-cart, and there got the inscription both lithographed and photographed. The discovery of the stone therefore belongs to Dr, Bel It w, that of the inscriptionto Dr. Leitner." 
A rubbingof the inscription was forwarded by Dr. Leitner to Professor Dowson who save 5 aoiitt of it in TMner's Eecord of June 1871.

Persian, i.e., the result was probablya Toiced sound. The KharSshthl sign itself seems to be derived from v and not from j>, by adding an upward stroke to the right. A similar stroke is found in the KhardshthI documents discovered in. Chinese Turkistan, where we sometimes find the letter which is usuallytransliterated st provided with a perpendicular, rising from the right end of the cross-bar. Of. plate XCII in Sir Aurel Stein's Ancient Kkotan, where Messrs. Boyer, Eapson and Senart read the akskara as sth in sthishyadi,1. 9. I am, therefore, inclined to think that vh, i.e., an aspirated voiced spirant, was the sound meant, and it would probably be more correct to transliterate vh. I do not think, however, that we can be certain about the pronunciation, and, for practical reasons, I preferto write /. 
. I may further draw attention to the compound letters tsa in sanibatfarae,I, 2, and rjhin erjhana, 1. 5. 
With regardto orthography and phonology we may note the changeof intervocalic $to y in maharayasa, 1. 1; puyae,11. 5 and 6;the softeningof intervocalic t to d in madu, 1. 5; pidu, 1. 6;the changeof v to b after an anusv&ra in sambat^arae^L 2; of ts to t$ in the same word ; of shy to * in isa, 1. 2, and of sr to sh in shadhadana, 1. 4. Such changes are, ftfl ia well known, of frequentoccurrence in Indian Khar5shthl inscriptions. 
In spite of all the care that has been bestowed on the reading and interpretation of the epigraph, several pointsare still far from being finallysettled. Dr. Thomas has, therefore, rendered a real service to scholars in preparingthe new facsimile plate published together with this article. 
The first Hue can be read with perfect certainty and has never presented any serious difficulty. Dowson read the second akshara of the king's name *w. instead of du, but a com parison with du in madu 1. 5, pidu,1. 6, conclusively shows that the letter is du. The third akshara has usually been rendered as pha, but I have already given my reasons for transli terating fa. We must accordingly read : maharayasa Gudufarasavasha 20-4-1-1, (duringthe reign) of the Maharaja Guchifara, in the 26 year. Yasha is also used in the Kaldarra inscrip tion of the year 113 and the Skarah Dheri epigraphof the year 399, while the Machai record of the year 8'l JaavasH, which is probablyintended in the other dates as well. There is not, however, any trace of an e-matrS. No certain inference can be drawn from the use of varsha instead of samvatsara iri these instances ;the word may have been chosen in our record in order to distinguish between the two dates in 11. 1 and 2, or in order to indicate ,that the year used in the first one began with the rains. 
Cunningham and Dowson identified Gudufara with the king G-ondopharesof Christian tradition, and this identification has been generally accepted and may be considered as pertam The date of 1. 1 has, further, always been interpreted .to mean that the inscription belongs to tHe 26th year of the reignof King Gudufara. Epigraphiats will, however, agree with me thai we are only informed that it was issued during Gudufara's reign, while the yearcan just as well be referred to some era whichmay have been introduced by some of Gudufara's predecessor*If we compare the datingof Br&hml inscriptionsof the Kushana period, we mightbe mclraed to think that the latter was the cue.

Senart .and Boyerrod and explainedthis word as meaning" du eomput continu ","in the continuous There cannot, however, be anydoubt that Dr. Thomas2 was right in reading The traces of the letters visible in the impressions and the plates make this reading Moreover, the use of ts for Sanskrit ts in this very word seems to be quite in inscriptions. Thus we find samvattarayS in the Taxila copper-plate of the year 76, in the Mount Ban] inscription of the year 102 and in the Paja record of the year 111. Similarly mmmtmrS is the usual form in the Khar5shthi documents from Eastern Turkistan. In the Sue Mr plate we have samvatsare, but the upper partof the compound is misshaped, Professor Franke41 reads sajhvachiare and Mr. Majumdar5 samvachcJrfiare. The Hiddaof the year 28 and the Ara inscriptionof the year 41, finally, have sambaUarae. writingts is no doubt meant to render the current pronunciation of the compound ts. Prakrit representativeof ancient ts is chchh, which only differs from t$ in being It ia probable that the form ti is due to the linguistic tendency of the north-western which the Indo-Skythians adopted. 
The compound occurs in the KharQshtM manuscript of the Dhammapada, where M*it iwf in ahitsai, A4 8; bhamtu3 "B 34; bMt&di Cvo 3 and mat/ana Cxviii vo 2* The last words correspond to Sanskrit bhetsyati and matsy&nam, respectively, where t has a origin as in t&lkvatfara. In ahitiaf and bhamet^u a t seems to have been inserted a and $ with a consequent change of s to There IB nowhere any trace of the which comes in in the common Prakrit form. 
There are indications which seem to show that the absence of aspirationin similar com is an old feature of north-western vernaculars. For we find pacha for pafoha in the version of the Asdka inscriptions. On the other hand, paicho, afterwards, in might lead as to the conclusion that we are faced with a phonetic tendency in tint of the IndoSkythians. 
Tfce of t to 6 in sa&batfaraS is perhapsto be explained as a result of the influeuce of ^fcilo-Skythiaasiitetratum.For not only do we find 6 for*v after an anwvora in the manuscriptof the DJiammapada, where api and wa become m and va, respectively, ftWTcnrols, but KmdJa, respectively, after an anusvOra* But in ancient Khotanl 6 fre corresponds to Sanskrit V| not only in loanwords such as bra, Sanskrit rt&s, but also such as 61*1, Sanskrit vitoa.

No. 28.] SO-CALLED TAKHT-KBAHX INSCRIPTION OF THE YEAB 103* 265   
The first word in 1. 3 was read pamchame by the two French scholars, who also agreed in reading the ensuing sign or signs as pa, which, according to M. Senart, is the signof the figure 5* I cannot acceptthis reading and interpretation. 
The first akshara is much damaged, and there are several strokes which are probably the result of the uee to which the stone lias been put* There cannot, however, be any doubt, that it is a jpa. I cannot se any trace of an anusvara 9 but there are some strokes at the bottom? which, may be the remnants of an u~m$tr& or of a post-consonanticr- The second letter consists 
o a vertical, bent towards the left at the top, and a distinct cross-bar. If the latter is accidental we would think of dha, and if the curvature at the topis due to accident or oversight, we would hare tha, I haye alreadyin another connexion1 suggestedto read prathamS, and I still think that reading the most likely one, though pradhame would also be possible. 
What M* Senart read as the symbol for 5 I read as di 1, It is, as is well known, the uuvariable custom in Kbar6shthl to use the symbols for 4 and I when the number fire is given in figures, and not in words. And it would be very extraordinary to find a notation of the kind suggested by M, Senart. 
The ensuingaksJiaras were for the first time read by M. Boyer, and Ms transliteration ifa is certainly cowect, though both letters are damaged, and it is possible that ise is the reading intended* Ifa and He ar of frequent occurrence in Ktar5shtto inscriptionsin India and Eastern Turkistan, and the meaning is clear ; they render Sanskrit asmin and atra. M. Boyer thinks that isa,cs with s instead of * as in M&gadhl," is Sanskrit esha, bufc that explanation cannot be rigbt? esha being nothing else than the nominative singular, and the change of s or sfa to s not being a feature of the vernacular, S can only be an old sh or the representative of an old shy. In the Shahfoazgayhi version of the Agdka icscriptioBS we repeatedlyfind forms such as a<ralb'hi$amti) Sanskrit arabMshyanti? and in the Khar5shthl manuscript of the Dhara mapada i is frequentlythe representativeof Sanskrit shy,3 Isa would accordingly be the regular representativeof a female oblique form from the base i, and it is possible that the theme ithya has developed a stereotype locative adverb ishye* At all events, the base must l3e the pronoun which we find in id-am. 
After im M. Boyer read ehhunami samana, and M. Senart * . , pa.de. . * . Khunami would of course suit the 'context very well, but samana could not represent Skr. dramana, as M, Boyer thinks, the only possible forms of that word in the dialect being Samana and shamuna* 
Now there cannot, I think, be any doubt that the two last afoharas of the passageare pachTie* The traces of both letters are quite distinct, and pa lias also been recognized by M. Senart The new platewill show that chh is also beyonddoubt. PachM can scarcely be anything else than Sanskrit pakshS, pakshe, or, perhaps, pathyS, salutary, suitable^ auspicious^ here used to characterize the day or the moment when the inscription was issued. 
There accordingly only remain two aksharas between Ma and paohhe, and so far as I can see the extant traces are more in favour of ding than of eJihune, though it is impossibleto be 
quite certain* 
I accordingly read the second data as follows : sambatiaraS tisatimae 1 100 111 Vefalchasa tnasasa divase p[ratha]mS di 1 isa [dine] pachhe,in the hundred and third year 1U3, ou the first day d. 1 of the month Vaisikha, on this jpa&s/ta-day, or,oti this auspicious day. 
The interpretationof the word pachhe is difficult. If we were justified in explainingit as corresponding to Sanskrit pathye, we should be able to prove conclusively that the date of 
i S. S.A. W.9 1916, p. 801. 
a See Johansson, Actes du 8 eongrfa international des orientalises II, iii, pp. 129 and 189, where, Iiowever, use of s has not been explained. 
s See Konow, Festschrift WMiwh* p. 93*EPIGBAPHIA INDfCA. [7oi,.   
ou is the first and not the fifth Vaiaakha. That date was auaptcious because wasto te the Buddha's birthday. Tradition placed that event on the full-moon day and the Takht-i-Bahi inscription would accordingly show that the months in Tndiawere p^^ju/asit can be provedto have been the case whenepigraphs dated in the Kanishka era were drawn up. 
ftnd in the KbaresWh! records from Central Asia there are two different ateharas ^h **- e 
There is, however, one grave objection to this interpretation. In the Asoka inscriptions usually both transliterated cM, one with, the other without a cross-bar below the head. Thelatter one is usually stated to be the only one occurring in later Indian KharOshthl inscriptions. That statement is not, however, correct. We find the cross-bar form m inscription J on the Uathura Lion capital, where we must read palichhina, Sanskrit pariohehhinna,instead of Btthler's palithtgna. Now an examination of the Kh#r5shfchl manuscript of the DJMmmapad*shows that the cross-bar form representsold ehh and also &hh derived from thy, while the other form stands for Sanskrit Ttth and should probably be transliterated Icsh and not dhh. It is this form which is used in pachhe, and it, therefore, seems necessaryto explainthis word as Sanskrit pakikS Of pakshS.I would therefore suggestto explaindine pachhe ^as dine pakshe, on (this) jM&%a-day, and assnme that the day is designatedin such a wayin order to mark it as the irst day of a, pafolia, though the paMias are not usually saextiioited in ]hai'5shthl inscriptions. 
Then follow five letters which M. Boyerread lelasami'sa, while M. Senart could notnmfee out more than the two last onea. M. Boyer a^s that the e-stroke' of the first letter is, perhaps, only a flaw in the stone, and it seems to me that &uch is, evidently the case. I,, there fore, read lalasamisa, the genitive of balasami, which corresponds to Sanskrit lalasvami-n. The final so, is quite distinct, and I, therefore, do not venture to follow Dr. Thomas^ who1 thinks that we ought probablyto read mira as in 1. 4. 
$. Boyer saw in ~bela.sa.misa the name of the. donor. It seems to me that such can scarcely fee &$ a*se, the donor being mentioned in 1. 4," sind. I, therefore, think tha,t balasam^sa should bewith the opening word of 1. 4. 
The last four aJcskaras of 1. 3 were read g'Syanasa by the two French scholars, but only M. Boyer tried to translate this word. He took gdyana to correspondto Sanskrit gQyQna, acarriage drawn by oxen, a cart in general, and drew the final s# to 1. 4. I think, however, tha*the extent traces show that Dr. Thomas was right3 in reading b$yanasct aa in 1. 4. I only differ 
froia Mm in transliterating the nasal as the cerebral n in accordance with my remarks.' Yol. XIV, pp. 181 ff. 
,which is also used together with the name Mira in 1. 4, cannot be an Indian word*M. Boyer sees in Mira Bsyana the Iranian name Mi3poj3ova^s,and this explanation in probably ri(&t, but it does not help us to understand the word boyana itself. It BQems to 
contaiu . too* toy and a termination ana. The latter is no doubt the well-known suffix ana,vudi foraB adjectives fi-om nouns (as in Khotanl balysani, belonging to the Buddha neW 4mparticiples from verbal bases. The base 1^ can be e witht raman fto^, to save, if we remember that *j between vowels has become and jw|?a.J

Sere M. Senart read pa . . aa, but M. Boyer was certainly rightin reading par[f]varu. At first sight one is inclined to read parovara, which might "be explained as a compound of para and ovara. Ovara would have to be taken as identical with ovaraJca, cell, which occurs in several Brahmi inscriptions.1 Parovara might mean"the predominant cell ". This explanation cannot, however, be upheld. An ovara for ovaraka does not occur in any other record, and even dvaralca, itself is never met with in Khardshthi inscriptions. I think that M. Boyer is rightin thinking that tie apparentcross-bar of the first r of par[f]vara is accidental, and that there are tz^acen of an i across the left extremity of the upper portionof the aksJia-ra. 
The word parivara, Sanskrit pariv&ra, occurs in many ancient records, M Boyer took it together with, the final sa of 1. 3 and explained sa~parivaraas an adjective characterizing goyana, the whole meaning"a cart together with as covering". He is fully aware of the difficulty arising from the nature of the donation, which would hardly justify the engravingof an inscription. He thinks, however, that the object of the epigraph may have been to honour the piin-ce mentioned in 1, 5 more than to record the gift. Or else, the cart may have been of great value, and the donation accordinglyof ^special merit. In this connexion, he draws attention to a passage in the Divyavad&na^ where we read y&nam d&nam dada.ti riddhip&davipaJcapr&tila* Wiasamvartantyam, he givesa cart, a gift leading to the acquisition of the result of the state of supernatural power. This explanation is very ingenious, but I fear that it is too ingenious, and if D*. Thomas* reading boyanasa in L 3 is accepted, we shall have to look out for another ex 
planation* 
The meaningc *covering (of a carriage)"is well attested for the .word parivara, but it is never met with in ancient inscriptions. In Brahmi inscriptions we find saparivara, e.g., in the Nasik inscriptions Nos. 8 and 9, and in his edition of them M. Senart remarks3:uIt is, i think, too precise to translate saparivara by' with his family*. If such were his intention, the engraver would rather have used special names of kinship or some generic word, as jdii", which occurs elsewhere. Parivyra may, together with the family or even excluding it, apply to companionsof the donor, fellow-workers or caste-partners." The original meaning of the word seems to be"covering>f,"surrounding", and it actually has this meaning in some passages in classical literature, but more frequentlyit must be translated by some word meaning surroundings, train, suite. This meaning does not, however, seem to give any sense in our inscription, and it may perhaps be of interest to famine other instances of its use in KharOshthi records. 
The oldest KharOshthi inscription where it occurs is the Mathura Lion capital. We ax^e there Informed of the fact that the chief queenof the Mahakshatrapa Eajula puts up some relics of the Buddha, together with some of her relatives, the ateura and the hfirakaparivara. Here ateura, correspondsto Sanskrit antahpura, the inner court, the female apartment of the palace and those who live in it. The horakas are the officials who are called hommurta, in the Manikiala inscription, and hdramurta is a"Saka"rendering of Sanskrit danapati.* Now it should be remembered that parivrita is used in the Satapatha-Br&kmatya (2.6.1.20) and elsewhere to denote a place enclosed with walls and used for worship, and hdrakaparivara might accordingly mean '* the enclosed hall of the hdrakas" and further "the horaka-department '*, a meaning which would he very appropriatein our passage, where the word is used in connexion with antahpura* which has a similar sense. 
The next time we find the wor&parivara in a Kharflshtbl inscriptionis in the record under discussion. The& follows the Sue Vihar copper-plateof the year 11, duringthe reignof Kanishka,

of which we have BOW a good reproductionin the excellent edition by Mr. N. 6. Maiizmdar** The third line of this record, where the word parivara occurs, cannot be read with absolute cer- ;and I shall not, in this place, tryto show how I arrive at my reading of the whale of it We that a yathi, a staff? has been raised (in memory) of tke friar NSgadatta, and that the Balanandi, the wife of a householder, and the mother of Balaja, makes a present of an awtparivara, which in my opinion can hardly mean anything else than a subsequent enclosing through a wall for the purpose of building up the shaft in which the staff was placed. The word pariv&ra again occurs in the Manikiala inscription, where we read that the Lala erects a stOpa, together with some other persons and the whole parivftra : elm parivarSna sadha. Here we may translate"together with the whole retinue" but the original meaning of parivara can very well be the same as in the Mathura Lion capital

read ya, by M, Boyer, has a distinct vertical, rising from the left hand termination, and looks like ta. The following akshara cannot, I think, be sa, but seems to be dhi, though it is different, from the dha in shadhadana. With every reserve I would therefore read saputadhi. But then 
the following aJcshara cannot be anything else than ta, though it looks more like a ra. The upper stroke is sloping upwards and not horizontal as in TO. Moreover, there are traces of an upward stroke at the left termination of the letter, which has become somewhat indistinct as a consequenceof the followingletter having been engraved across it. That last akshara is quite misshaped, and it seems necessary to infer that it has not been engravedbefore the ensuing ahshara. 'It seems as if it had originally been overlooked and waa subsequently added, after the omission had been detected. There was not then sufficient spacefor the proper shape of the akshara, and its upper part was engraved above the other letters and across the precedingta. "We have a similar letter at the very end of the Zeda inscription, where the last word is no doubt Samghamitramjasa. I therefore read the aksJiara as sa and the whole^compotuad as saputadhitasa. 
The remaining portion of 1. 4 does not present any difficulty, and both M. Senart and M. Boyer agree in reading Miraboyanasa. I have no hesitation in^accepting this reading, only substituting na for their na. Mira is, as stated by M. Boyer,the Iranian TULithra, and it is of interest to note that tr has become r as in Ancient Khotanl. 
The first three akshara$ of 1. 5 were read ejhshuna by M. Boyer, while M. Senart only read the first and third letters. The second aksJiara is certainly a compound, and the upper part Is clearly jh. The curved line across the lower vertical is ihe usual signof a r preceding the consonant, and such is evidently its significance in our inscriptionas well. A compound 
jTis"h is in itself very unlikely and has never been met with in anyKhardshthi record, while rjh also occurs in the Zeda inscription. The loop below the akshara looks like an u-m&tra and it would be natural to read erjhuna,1 If we bear in mind, however, that the usual way of denoting a r forming the first partof a compound in later Kharoshthl inscriptions is to add a loop at the bottom, it is perhaps possibleto consider our compound as an intermediate form and to read erjhana and, finally, the reading erjhana might also be possible. Of. my remarks to the word shadhadana, 1. 4. At all events, there cannot be any <}oubt that we have to do with an nn-Indian word. 
The letter j& is seldom used in Indian inscriptions. "Where it occurs in KharOslithl records, it seems to represent a voiced z, just as is the case in the KharQshthl documents from Eastern Turkistan, where s is commonly softened between vowels so that we find dajha for d&sa^ divajha for divasa. The letter is found in the Zeda inscription, where marjhaJca, L 2, is evidently identical with Khotanl malysalvi* ;in the Maaikiala inscription, where we must read XLartiyasa majhe divase 20, with the same softening of s between vowels as in the Turkistan documents, and in the Ara inscription, where Vayheshka correspondsto Brahml Vftsishha. This name is evidently derived from the Iranian base vaza, strength, vigour. Similarly jh is used for z in the coin-legends of Zoilos. 
The sound s nad long ago become obsolete ia Indian languages, and considerable difficulty was experienced when it had to be expressed in foreign words. The form Vasishka shows that it *was occasionally written as s, and later on j became the representative of 2?, as, e.g., ia the coin-legends of Zeionises. If IZusuhtka, which occurs in the Taxila copper-plateof Patika and on the Mathnra Lion capital,is the same word as kujulain the name of the first Kusli&na ruler, we here have s and j in the same word as different attemptsat renderingthe voiced s.

270 EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. [VOL. XVIII.   
A fourth attempt was made in the records of Ysamotika and Ms successors, viz., by means of the compound ysl;and this same device became the rule in Ancient Khotani. 
Erjkana accordingly represents an attemptat rendering the sounds of erzana or erisctna, tnd there can be no doubt that in this form we have to see the same word which, occurs in Ancient Khotanl as alysanai, eysaihnai, which is used to render Sanskrit kumara. The I before the voiced s in this word, as also in malysaki, is certainly a later development in Khotanf, which, on the whole, agrees with Old Iranian in usingr for I throughout.. 
M. Boyer, who read ejhsbuna, saw in this word the name of a prince and thought that this name was an Iraruan compound containingtzad as its first part. But no similar name is known to exist, and in my opinion, my explanation of the word is absolutely certain. 
If now erjharta belongsto the language which I have called Khotani, it would be natural to infer that the individual characterized as erjhana, i.e., Jcum&ra, belonged to the tube or tribe* who used that form of speech. His name must be contained in the fourth and fifth aksharas of 1. 5, which M. Senart read as kapa, while M. Boyer, who admitted that the firs* aJcshara looks like fa, suggested to read [bhu]pa. There cannot be any question about the nature of the first letter. It is fo, and it is so clearly cut that we have no right to correct it The second akshara is certainly pa, but underneath there are distinct traces bf an akshara which I have formerly" suggested to read as in or sha. It now seems to mo that it must be 
read M *&a, there being distinct traces of a vertical below the semi-circle, ..,of the letter sha. I fell think that thie tephn cannot be anybody else than the Kushana prince whose name written in many different ways, TcadpUses and Jcadaphes in Greek letters, and fewa, toplud

of the name ^.2/a=Azes, characterizing the year as belongingto an era established by In my edition of that inscriptionI have mentioned1 the reasons which have been urged by various scholars againstthis interpretation, and so far as I can see theyare still as cogent as they were ten years ago,If ayasa were the name of a king, the inscription would necessarily fall within his reign. The absence of everytitle is, however, so extraordinarythat it is almost impossible that the word can be the came of a ruler, Professor Rapson,it is true, asks2..us to remember"that the inscription belongs to a peoplethat knew not Azes. His family had been deposed and deprivedof all royal attributes. The throne of Takshasila had passed from the Sukas and Pahlavas to the Kushanas. Azes could scarcely have been furnished with his wonted title,4 Great King of Kings ', in this inscription, without prejudiceto the house then actually reigning." Are we to believe, then, that the people who did not know Azes still used name in connexion with the era current in the district ? 
There is another reason which, in my opinion, makes it impossibleto ascribe the establish ment of the era to Azes : that theory makes it necessaryto separate one of the Rhardshth* inscriptions, the Taxila plateof Patika, which is dated in the same way as the other epigraphs, from the rest and construct a special era for it That has also, as is well known, been done by several scholars. Sir John Marshall has, consistently with his interpretation of the Taxila silver scroll, explainedthe words maharayasa mahamtasa Mogasain the Taxila plate as indicating the ruler who established the era used in the record. Professor Bapson thinks3 that this era"may possibly mark the establishment of the new kingdomin Seistan, Mithiudates I c. 150 B.C, If so, the date of 
after its incorporationinto the Parthian empire by 
the inscription would be o. 72 B.C., a year which may well have fallen in the reign of Maues." He further shows that the theory accordingto which Mithradates I conquered North Western India is based on a misunderstandingof a statement of Orosius and goes ou to remark ;"The invasion of India must be ascribed not to the Part-Man emperors, but to their former feudatories in eastern Iran;not to the reignof Mithradates I, but to a period after the reign of Mithradates II (i.e., after 88 B.C.), when the powerof Parthia had declined and kingdoms once subordinate had become independent." M. Foucher4 holds a similar view, but seems inclined to refer the date of the Taxila plateto the Parthian era of 248 B.C., supposing the figure for hundred to have been suppressed,so that 78 would stand for 178 and 'correspond to 70 B.C. 
I cannot accept any of these theories : Sir John's not because a proper name in the genitive in connexion with the date in ancient records invariably denotes the ruler in whose reign the inscription was executed, and the other ones because I do not think that we have any indica tion of the use of foreigneras in India in ancient times, at least not in private document^ and most Kharsshth! inscriptions are of that nature. I quite agree with M. Foucher, who discusses the supposeduse of the Seleukidan era in some Khar5shthl epigraphs and, after mentioning the well-known dated coin of Platon, goes on to say5;"Just as much as the use*of the Greek reckoning seems to us to be on its place on an essentiallyofficial and governmental piece like the Platon coin, justas difficult would it seem to us to justifyit in the case of a private ex-voto, emanating from a simple indigenousdonator." Patika can hardly be supposed to have used an old era belongingto the dynasty from which the invaders of India, the ancestors of his own suzerain, had made themselves independent. Even if we were to admit the possibility of omitted hundreds in these dates, what I do not think we are justified to do, the only natural inference from the general state of thingsin the Indian borderlands in the first

century B.C., would be that the era used in the Patika plate was instituted in commemorationof the conquestof India by the dynasty to which Moga belonged, or of its emancipation from dependance on the Parthian overlords. In other words, the initial point of the era cannot fall before 88 B.C. 
The date of the Patika plate can, as is well known, be broadly fixed with reference to the Amshini votive tablet of the year 72, during the reign of the Mahakshatrapa Sfldasa. Professor Bapson, it is true, gives1 -42 as the date of that epigraph. He seems to be unaware of the fact that Professor Liiders has proved2 that the symbol used in the Ssdasa inscription, something like a St. Andrew's cross, must be read as 70 and not as 40. So far as I can see, no otter scholar has accepted Professor Rapson's reading, and so long as he has not shown that Professor Lfiders* convincing arguments are inconclusive, we can safely adhere to the prevailing opinion. 
I agree with most other scholars in referring the date of the S<5dasa record to the Vikrama ei*. It accordingly corresponds to 15 A.D- In that year Sodasa was Mahakshatrapa. In the inscriptions on the Mathura Lion capital Sudasa, i.e., Sodasa, is mentioned as Kshntrapa whole hia father Bajola is characterized as Mahakshatrapa. The Lion capital must accordingly be older than the Amflhini tablet, how much older we cannot say. Sir John Marshall has hewn* that Rajula was probably ruling about the beginning of the Christian era, and we can date the Lion capital between, say,1 and 10 A.D.

records should be referred to one and the same era, so that there are, accordingly, 25 years between the Patika plate and the so-called Takht-i-Bahl inscription, or, in other words, between Moga and Gndnfara. 
Snch an interval is about what we would expect, consideringttie fact that only the Idng or Mugs known as Azes and Azdlises seem to intervene between them. The reason why this infer ence has never been drawn is probably that Cunningham's dictum, that the inscriptionis dated in the 26th yearof the reign of Gudufara, has never been challenged.I have already stated above that a comparison of other ancient records necessarily leads us to the conclusion that the Gudufara inscription is dated in the year 26 of some era which may or may not coincide with his individual reign. And if it is admitted that Moga was still reigning about 17 B.C. or perhaps even later, and that we have absolutely no real reason for referring the Gudufara date to the Vikraraa era, we are inevitably led to the conclusion that the year 26 refers to an era established by some of Gudufara's predecessors, and in that case there cannot be the question of any other ruler than Azes. If, therefore, we refer the Patika date and the Gudufara date to the same era, it will be seen that the era which I think commemorates the accession of Azes logins one yearbefore the Patika date. But then his record hails from Taxila, while the so called Takht-i-Bahl inscription only informs us of the fact that, 25 years later, the rule of another dynasty had extended its sway as far eastward as Takht-i-Bahi or Shahblsgarhi The conquest of Taxila did not take placein the first year of the Parthian era. 
There is nothing inconsistent in this supposition. The Saka conqueststarted from Seistan, reached the Indus country and thence extended over Taxila and Gandhara. The Parthian dynasty, to which Gudufara belonged, came from the west through the Kabul country.It found a Saka era in use in the conquered territories, and the use of this era had become so firmly established that a subjectof Gudufara, 26 yearsafter the establishment of Parthian rule, thought it necessary to record the date of his epigraph, not only in the Parthian era, but also in the old Saka reckoning. 
Nor can we wonder at the absence of any later reference to the Parthian era. The dynasty founded by Azes waa short-lived. After Gudufara's reignit was replaced by the KushS^as, the successors of the Sakas, in the Kabul country and in Taxila, and the second Kushana ruler, Vima Kadphises, reconquered"India ",* A, the Indus country and probably ako Kathia war and Central India, and I still think that that event was commemorated through^the institution of the Saka era, as stated in the K&laMct&ryakathanakaJ*In other wprds^the Saka era commemorates the final re-establishment of Indo-Skythiaurule after the intemiptioncaused by the Parthian conquest, and it is a revival of the Saka era introduced after the first Saka con quest of India. In this way it also becomes intelligible why Chinese sources speakof Vima Kadphises' conquest as a re-conquest. 
I agree with Messrs. Poucher and Rapson that the first Saka conquest must be subsequent to the demise of Mithradates II in 88 B.C. The subsequent weakening of Parthian power made it possible for the Sakas of Seistan to assert fcheir independence, and the strengtheningof their power resulting from the immigrationof new Saka hordes led to an expansionof their realm into the Indus country. We do not know who the first Saka conqueror was. We only know the name of the Saka ruler or rulers Manes, Moga, and we have seen that Moga was still ralmg 25 years before the Gndufara inscription. 
It has been customary to speakof several mien intervening between Moga and Gtndu&n, one or two bearing the name Azes and one or two called Arises. Opinions Differm to the nationality of this or- these rulers. Some scholars think that they were Parthians, others that the, were Sakas. I have never been able to understand why it should be necessaryto assume

the existence of more tiian erne ruler AzesrAzilises. As pointed out by Dr. Thomas,1 Azes is a short form of Azilises. And if we compare the coin legends, we are, I think, led to tlie conclu sion that Azes and Azilises are one and the same person. When we find coins with the legends

Nor do I think that there can be any doubt about the nationality of this ruler : lie was a Parthian and not a Saka king. That follows, in my opinion, from the coin-legends showing the names of Spalirises, Spalahora and Spalagadames. In the first place we have the coins of SpaK rises, the king's brother, with the legends basileds adelphou Spalirisou on the obverse and maharajabhrata dhramiasa Spaliri$a$a on the reverse. Then we find Spalirises associated with AIM, with the legends basileds megaton SpaUrisou on the obverse and maharafasa mahataJcam 4yaa on^thereverse. Here Azes is associated with Spalirises, but he has not yet assumed the taperial title.

, 28.] SO-CALLED TAKHT-I-BAHI INSCRIPTION' OP THE YEAR 103. 275   
The best' known of the Saba rulers 'is Moga, who was still on the throne in the year 78 of the old Saka era. If it is granted that the establishment of that' era must be subsequent to tlie year 88 B.C., the year 78 cannot be earlier than 10 or 9 B.C. The Patika plate mention ing it is dated on the fifth Panemos* From the use of the Macedonian name we can infer that the year began, as in the Macedonian calendar, with the month Dios, i.e., it was Kartfakadi, The month Panemos corresponds to June. If the beginning of -the era coincided with October 88 and the years were currentj the earliest possible date for the Patika plate would be June, 10 B.C., and if the years wex*e elapsed, June, 9 B-C* It is not, however, probable that the era was established before one or two years after the demise of Mithradates II* On the other hand, some time was required for Patifca, who in the year 78 was not even a Kshatrapa, to acquire the rank of Mahakshatrapa, and further for 5dafia, who was Kshatrapa when Patika was Mahakshatrapa9 to be promoted to Mahakshatrapa, a position which he held in 15 A.D. We can, therefore, with some confidence, state that the last ten years before the beginning of our era must be the period when the Patika plate was engraved. 
Now I have tried to show that a aew, Parthian, era had been established one year before tlie date of the Patika plate, by Azes, the first Parthian conqueror of the Kabul country and Western Panjab, and that the so-called Takht-i-Bahi inscriptionis dated in the 26th yearof tliat era. That would take us to the time 16-20 A,D., which would be a very likely date for Gndufara, who is generally assumed to have come on the throne in 19 A.D. 
Gudufara is, as I have already mentioned, certainlyidentical. with the King Gondophares who, according to Christian tradition, summoned, the apostle Thomas to his court. This tradition is not, however, of much use for chronological purposes. In the first place, the name of the kiog is not mentioned before, the third or fourth century A.D., and, in the second, the whole tradition cannot prove anything more, than that the name of the KingGudufara had become known in the Christian east about the time of Christ's death or of the first Christian mission, 
We do not know how long Gudufara's rule lasted. We leant from the PanjtSr inscripr tion that a Kushana-Maharaja (Gushana, maJiaraya) had come into power in the year 122, i.e., 19 years after the date of our inscription, and from the Taxila silver scroll that this same Kusha^ia had assumed the -imperial titles maMraja rajatir&ja devaputra14 years later, in the year 136. If the so-called Takht-i- Bail inscription belongsto one of Gudufara's first years, he cannot, accordingly, ham held undisputed sway for more than about twenty years, aad we do not know anything which militates against snob an assumption, 
With regard to the ruler mentioned in the Paujtar and Taxiia recordsopinions^differ, hut all scholars are agreed that it is the same ruler who is mentioned in both Inscriptions. From a consideration of the find-plaeeeof the two epigraphs we can infer that he had, between the years 122 and 186, extended his sway eastwards, and the increase of his power consequent on this extension is illustrated in the higher, titles used in the Taxila scroll But both find-plaoes full within the territory which the Chinese called Kipin,1 and which, accordingto them, was con quered by Kadphises I, while India", which was subdued by Kadphises II, must be located outside of Kipin. 
In full agreement with this state of thingsSir John Marshall* has shown goodreasons for Identifying the Kushana-Maharaja of these records with Kujfila- Kadphises, and I am more convinced than ever that he is right, thoughthe prevailing opinion seems to b that Vima Kadphises is the ruler mentioned. 
1Of. X!f. Ind., XIV, pp. 290 ft* / * $Q276 EPIGBAPHIA INDIOA. [Voi, XVIII.   
We know from the Hou ffan-shu, the annals of the Later Hans, Oh. 118, foL II70 that the M^fwu of Kuei-shuang, Kiu-tsiu-k'io, i*en Kujula Kadphises,after conquering four other M-hou$, established himself as wang (king) and used the dynastic title"King of Kuei-slmang '% i.e., Kushana King, that he invaded An-si (Parthia), seized the territory of Kaof11 (Kabul), annihilated P*u-ta and Kipin, and that all these territories formed his empire. He became eighty years old, and was succeeded by his son Yen-Kao-chen, i.e.yVima Kadphises, who**again"conquered India, where he appointeda generalto rule as his viceroy. 
The Sou &an~$hu cover the period beginning with 24 A.D. Knjfila Kadphises*consolida* tion of the Knshana empire accordinglyfalls after that date. Before then he can only have been a petty hi*hou or a young prince. But afterwards he gradually became king (wang) and king of Kuei-shuang. 
It will be seen that all these details point to the conclusion that the Kushana-MaharSja was Kujftla and not Vima Kadphises. The latter ruler does not seem to have resided in India, He ruled through a viceroy, and in my opinion this viceroy is the Soter Megas, whose"coins are found in extraordinary abundance, and over a wide stretch of country extending from Pesh&war to MathunL These facts pointto a great power and 9, long reign, and are much in favour of the suppositionthat we must look for Soter Megas amongst the most importantof the kings and satraps known to us, as it is very improbable that such a great potentate would be nameless and unknown except from these coins. The style of the coins, which are in copper only, and the absence of square forms point to a period about the Kushaga conquest, so that Soter Megas was probablya contemporary of one of the two Kadphises." 
<c Certain types almost invariably exhibit in the field the Khar5shthl akshara vi,"1 and I agree with Cunningham that this vi may possibly be the initial of the king's name, though Mr. Whitehead does not acceptthis view. If it is correct, we would have a clear indication of Vima Kadyhises beingthe suzerain on whose behalf the Soter Megas coins were issued. 
Mr. Whitehead thinks it possible that these coins were strnck by more than one ruler. I think that he is right, and that the Soter Megas coinage covers the period from the accession of Vima Kadphisesto the installation of Kanishka. Sir John Marshall is no doubt right in assuming2 an interval between the reigns of KadphisesII and Kanishka, but we have no
information about the Kishana rulers who held sway at headquarters after the denu.se of VimaKadphises. 
Moreover the designation Kush&na-Mahar&ja is more easily understandable, without the addition of any personal name, in the case of the ruler who first introduced it, than with his sue* cessor, and if Vima Kadphises was the king who introduced the later Saka era, as I think wemust infer from a comparisonof Chinese tradition and the K&laTcacTi&ryakatliancilta, he cannot be the Kusha$a-Maharaja of the Panjtar and Taxila records* We can only think of Kujul$, Kadphises. 
It has been urged against this that the Taxila scroll shows a monogram %t which is characteristic <?f the coins of Vima Kadphises. Sir John Marshall has, however, drawn attention to the fact that the same monogram also occurs on the coins of his predecessor, and I may add that it is likewise met with on coins of Zeionises. Professor Rapson3 objects that the coins in question&t bear the name not of Kujnla Kadphises, but of Kujula Kara Kadphises,, who was probably another member of the dynasty .... Kujula Kara Kadphisesseems to have succeeded the Satrap Zeionises in the kingdom of Pushkalavatl, and he may have been contemporary with Vim$ Kadphises.'1

being myself a numismatist I feel some hesitation in differing from a scholar whose knowledge of Indian coins is probably at the present time unsurpassed. I cannot, however, help thinking that numismatists are too much inclined to construct different rulers at the hand of different coin-types. Just as I have not been able to convince myselfof the existence of more than one Azes, in the same way I fail to see that the; variety in the titles used by Kujfila Kadphises makes it necessary to assume the existence of more than one ruler of that name. Wemust not forget that Chinese tradition assigns a long periodto his reign* 
Kupla Kara Kadphises cannot have been a pettychief or a subordinate ruler like the BLsliatrapa Zeionises, He is designated as maharaya rayatiraya and maharaya rayaraya devaputra* Similar titles, viz,, maharaja mahata and maharaja rajatirajaare met with on coins which bear the name of Kuyula Kapha, and I do not think that it can reasonablybe doixbted that Kujlla Kadphises and Kujnla Kara Kadphisesare one and the same person. Sir John Marshall1 found at Sirkap a coin showing, on the obverse, the bust of Hermaeus with a corrupt Greek legend, and, on the reverse, a Khar5shhi legendof which we can at least read jula feara. Here Kujftla Kara's name occurs on a coin showing the bust of Hermaeus, and tlitis his identity with Kadphises I becomes still more probable. We do not know the etymo logical meaning of the word kujula* I may add that I do not any more think it likely that it is a Turki word.3 We have no certain traces of Turkish in the languageor titulature of the Indo-Skythians* The title yavuga, which has often been stated to be an adaptationof the Tnrki yalgu, has not been etymologically explained, and it is perhaps more probable that it is originally an Iranian word which has been taken over by the Turks than that the opposite Bhiould be the case. 
I therefore identify Kujftla Kara Kadphiseswith Kujula Kadphises and cannot admit that ttife use of the monogram in question on the Taxila silver scroll can be urged against the view that the Kushana king mentioned in the inscriptionis Kujftla Kadphises. 
There is still another reason which strongly speaksin favour of this identification: Yima Kadphises is never, in his coin-legends, designatedas a Kuslxina, and nobody would, I think", a priori be inclined to identify him with the Gwshana-maharaja of the Panjtar inscription and tlie maharaja rajatiraja^ devaputra KhusMna of the Taxila silver scroll,if it were not for the common theory that the Saka era was established by Kanishka 
I do not overlook the fact that Sir John Marshall has found some coins at Sirkap which seem to show the legend maharajasa rajatirajasa Khushana&a yavuga$aywhile the obverse bears the head of a KushSna king, resembling that of Vima Kadphises.Sir John* is inclined to ascribe these coins to Vima Kadphises and writes :" The epithet Tavuga (-Turkish jabgou)IB found on coins of Kujula Kadphises, and is supposedto have been replaced by the title matomj* rajatiraja after the conquestof India. The simultaneous use, however, of the two terms in one and the same legend appears to indicate that the prevalent view regardingthe meaningand use of this title is not wholly correct." He is not, it should- be noted, certain about the assignation of these coins to Vima Kadphises, and, in my opinion, the use of the title Khushana yamga goes a long way towards provingthat they should be assignedto Kujula Kadphises. The legend informs us of the fact that he who was then the maharaja rajatiraja had risen to that exalted position from the rank of a Khushana yavuga, and I cannot help thinkingthat there is a touch, of justifiable pridein the wording of the legend.

the coins in question manifestly come from the Kabul valley, we must supposethat they the ordinary currency of the Kushanas at the time when the invasion took place and that they were introduced into Takshagila as large numbers of Sassanian coins were brought into the coun try of the lower Indus from Iran bythe Hunas of the fifth century A.D. It is, therefore, by no means impossiblethat Kujftla Kadphises may have been not later than, but contemporary with, Gondophames ; and there is no reason to doubt the statement of the Chinese writers that it wasnot Kujnla Kadphises, but his son and successor, Vima Kadphises, who extended the dominions of the Kushanas from the Kabul valleyto N.-W. India." 
I quite agree with Professor Rapsonthat the bulk of Kujflla Kadphises'coins may have been struck in the Kabul valley, but in other respects I differ from him toto coelo. The Chinese sources do not, as we have already seen, tell us that Vima Kadphises, and not Kujfila Kadphises, conquered N.-W. India. They state that the latter invaded An-si (Partlua), conquered Kao-fu (Kabul), P'u-ta (probablythe country about Ghazni) and Ki-pin. But -we know that Ki-pin comprised partsof the Panjah, i.e., JS.-W. India,2 and the "India "con quered by Vima Kadphises cannot he identified with N.-W. India. 
In snch circumstances it seems to me that the Sirkapcoins must be ascribed to Kujnla, andnot to Vima Kadphisea. Coins of the known typesof the former were found in the samelocality, but no corns of Vima Kadphises or of Soter Megas.It cannot be objectedthat Ku.jIaKadphises' bust does not occur on any of the coins which can, with certainty, be ascribed to him. Professor Rapson has giventhe explanationof this fact : these coins were struck in the Kabul valley, and it was only after the conquest of TakshaSila that KujSla Kadphises introduced his bust on his coins, probablyin direct imitation of Gondopharnes. 
It is of interest to note that the form KhusJia^a occurringin the Sirkap legendsis also foundon some coins of Kujula Kadphises with the legend Khushanasa yavuasa Kuyulu Kaphsasasaehad hramathitasa, and some of these coins were found together with the new typeat Sirkap, with the legend KJmsha^aga yavugasa Kuyula Kasasa. 
Bo far &e I can see, the cumulative weight of all these indications makes it necessary to ascribe the silver coins found at Sirkap, with a head"resembling"that of Vima Kadphises, to Kujnla Kadphises and to infer that they were struck during his rule at Taxila, in imitation of tlie practice adhered to by his predecessors. 
Now I have tried to show above that the date of the Qudufara inscription must fall bet-ween 16 and 26 A.D. Nineteen years later, i.e., between 35 and 45, the Kushana ruler of the Panj tar record had assumed the title Maliaraja, and 33 years later, i.e., between 49 and 59, he uses the imperial titles Maharaja rajatiraja divaputra.If the ruler in question was Kujnla Kad phises, he had already a distinguished career behind him when, he began his conquestof theParthian empire. He had succeeded some other ruler as yavuga, and he had subjected four

other yavugas to his rule. He cannot have been quite a young man. If we assume that lie was about 40 years old at the time of the Panjjtar inscription, his death must have taken place between 75 and 85 A.D., and it will be seen that the establishment of the Saka era,, which I ascribe to his son and successor, falls within that period. On the other hand, he can hardly have been an old man when he started on his eventful career. We know from Chinese sources* that that happened after 24 A,D. We can infer, with some confidence, that he was born shortly before or shortly after the beginningof our era, and as h died an octogenarian,that would take us to the same time as 1 have come to above. I am unable to see how Vima Kadphises can possibly be pressedinto the period between Gudufara and the establishment of the Saka era,1 and the theory that that reckoning was introduced by Virna KadpMses is the only explanation, which is not merely based on general chronologicalconsiderations but derived from definite statements in Chinese and Indian literature, and I have not seen any serious grounds 
urged against it. 
In such circumstances my identification of the prince {erjJiana) Kapsha mentioned in 1. 5 of the Gudufara inscription with Kujftla Kadphisesreceives considerable support. He is not dis* tingmshed by any title which would lead us to infer that he was a ruling prince* He is not even styled yavuga, but simplycharacterised as erjha-na,i.6 M kum&ra. We would naturally infer that "he had not yet risen to the rank of yavuya, and at all events, that his conquest of the other ytt'cugas had not yet taken place. He may have been a young man, of say twenty yearss and if lie were born about the beginningof the Christian era, the date of the Oudufara in* scription -would correspond to c. 2O A.D. 
I do not think that it is possible to arrive at more definite results at the hand of the mate rials themselves, without any hypothetical interpretationof their test. I believe, however, that there is one indication in one of the ancient KharOshthl records which may some day lead ns to 
an absolutely certain conclusion about the initial pointof the era, I refer to the word ayas in the Taxila scroll inscription. 
I have stated above that I think it impossibleto explainthis ayasa as the genitive of the name Aya, Azes. But then ayasa must be connected with a&hadasa masasa, and the only question is why ifce month is characterized as aya. Aya might, of course, correspond to Sanskrit ftrya, and Professor Jacobi has mentioned the possibility that the month may have been called 
Aryan because the Indian and not the Macedonian month is mentioned* It will, however* be seen from a comparison of the elates of the Gudufara, the Paja,the Kaldarra and the PanjtSr inscriptions, that the use of the Indian and not the Macedonian names of the months was a common feature at the time wken the Tasila silver scroll was inscribed. I therefore still 
think, as 1 thought when I publishedthe record, that ayasa correspondsto Sanskrit ftdyasya. It should Toe 'remembered that adya does not become ajjain any Prakrit dialect, and that the change of dy to yy is attested through uyy&na,Sanskrit udyana^ which is met with both ia P&li and in tlie Shahbtegayhi version of the As5ka edicts. 
"When the month Ashadha is designatedas the"first"Ashadha, that does_not, of course, mean that Ashadha was the first month of the year, but that there were two Ashaclhas in that particular year. Can this information help us to settle the question about the precise date of the record ? 
The reply would, of course, be in the negative,if we had to do with the ancient Indian. calendar of the Jydtisha, according to which there was an intercalated Ashadha every five years, I have, however, already drawn attention to the fact that the calendar used in the old Kharfcshthl inscriptions is not purely Indian but contains foreign, Greco-Macedonian, elements. In other

words, we have to do with the initial stagesof that development which finally led to the recasting of Indian astronomy and the Indian calendar on purely scientific lines. The question then arises whether we should not be justified in applying the methods of the Siddhantas to the date of the Taxila silver scroll It is true that the Siddhantas are later than the inscription. According to Dr. Thibaut,1 the S&rya- Siddhanta and pome other Siddhantas are probably at least some centuries older than 500 A.D., but not .necessarily more than two or three centuries older. But then it should be borne in mind that the Sfddkttota* are the result of a long development and not the first laying down of scientific astronomical principles. It is, therefore, not excluded that their methods can be used for a still older period. The question is not so much what the general Indian astronomer knew about calendar matters in the first century A.D., as what the Indo-Skythian successors of the Greek princes hadlearnt from their predecessors and how they had arranged their Greco-Indian calendar. I do not myself understand anything about astronomy, and I cannot, therefore, form anindependent opinion. I have, however, submitted the question to my friend the Dutch scholar Dr. W. B. van Wijk, who has been good enough to calculate which years between A.D. 50 and 80 had an intercalated Ashadlha according to the Siddh&ntas. He has informed me that such was the case in the years 52 and 71 A.D., and Mr. Sewell has accepted this result. Of these two dates only the former one is possible. For, if Sam. 136 corresponded to 71 AJX, the 5th Panemos 78, the date of Patika plate, would correspond to 13 A.D., only twoyears before the Sodasa inscription, and two years are not sufficient for covering the events falling between the two records. The year 52, on the other hand, excellentlysuits the facts as we know them. If it should prove to be right, the date of the Gudufara inscription wouldcorrespond to 10 March 19 A.D., i.e., about 60 years before the beginning of the Sakaera, andif Kapsha, i,e,, Kujjula Kadphises, were then twenty years old he would have been bora in 1 B.C. The year 103 would have begun in October 18, and the accession of Axes, if the figure 26 refers to an era instituted by him, would fall in the year 9-8 B.C., wherewith it is impossible to know whether the use of the term varsha for*yearfpointsto a year beginning with the rains and not with the autumn. 
If this result is accepted, it would become possible to give the dates corresponding to those occurring in other Khar&sbth! records of the older series. The Patika plateof the 5th Panemos V8= June 6 B.C. ; the Machai inscription of the year 81=4-3 B.C. ; the Mount Banj inscription of the year 102=18-19 A.D.;the Paja inscription of the 15th Sravana 111=23 June 27 A.D. ; theKaldarra inscription of the 20th Sravana 113 = 5 July29 A.D. ; the Panj tar inscription of the 1st Sravana 122=7 June 38 A.D.;the Taxila silver scroll of the 15th of the first Asha 4ha 136 = 17 May 52 A.D. the Dewai inscription of the 8th VaisHkha 200=24 March 116 A.D. ; the Loiiyan Taugai inscription of the 27th PrSshthapada 318=27 August 234; the JamSlgarhi 
inscription of the 1st Aspaiu (?) 359 =September 276 A.D.;the Hashtnagar inscription of the 5th Proshthapada 384=7 June 300 A.D.; the Skarah pherl inscription of the 10th (or 20th) Isha^ha 399=28 April or 8 May 815 A.D.3 
I give these identifications with every reserve. Future research may make it necessary to fix the initial point of the era some few years later than I have done, but the relative chronology is, I think, certain. The new arrangement also removes a great difficulty which has been felt by everybody who has studied the history of the Xndo-Skythians : the many different eras supposed to be used side by side in their records. The late Dr. Fleet consistently maintained that all the dates of Indo-Skythian records should be referred to the Vikrama era, which he held to be introduced bv Kanishka. I do not think that anybody holds that view at the present date.

It is extraordinary how tenacious this idea of suppressed centuries is. I quite tl dictum of the late Dr. Fleets : There is, in fact, no sound reason for thinking that thi in*, tional method of recording, dates was used in ancient times in any temfcory m Mvway within the scopeof our inquiry," The results of referring the Khatfehthi with 
years higher than 300 to the Maurya era are, moreover, jostas fatal as if we'uae the reckoning. We would have to date the Loriyan Tangai statue in the year 3 B.C. and the Hashtnagar pedestal in 63 A.D. Now paleography seems to be in discredit at the but still I think most scholars would experience some difficulty in ascribing the epigraph to an earlier date than the Gudufara and Paja inscriptions. M. thinks that the epoch of the Loriyan Tangai stopa is late, and according to him, the second century A.D. The point d'appui for this dating is the Kaidshka reign, lit supposes to begin about 78 A.D. If now the accession of Kanishka took place 50 years after that date,4 the Loriyan Tangai $t$pa must he referred to the third century, m I clone above. M , Foueher, it is true, places the inscribed statues from and Rajar (Hashtnagar) before Kanishka, but it seems to me that Ms reason, the of the foldings of the garments, is^ far from being convincing.If an older image ww aid had to be replaced by a new statue, the Gandhara artiste of a later period were not "backward in imitating ancient models' than the Indian craftsmen of the statues without heads and hands are,it would seem, not the very best for chronological conclusions* 
Moreover, it would .seem to be a necessary preliminaryto the reawafeeaing f the of a Maurya era to show that the strong reasons cannot be accepted which the field in order to show that the whole idea of such an era is without^ any it would have been well to try to explain the curious fact that there is not the to any such era in the numerous epigraphsof the great Mauxya emperorAldim.

foundation for the belief in its existence than there would be if somebody were to suggest that an era was instituted to commemorate the conquest of India by Alexander. The only objection against referring the high dates in KharOshthl inscriptionsto the old Saka era of which. I can think, is that it seems difficult to understand why it was not replaced by the Kanishka era* But then we have the analogy of the Ghidufara inscription, which shows that the old em had gained such a firm footing in Yusufzai that it survived the introduction of a new, Parthian era. There are, on the whole, no traces of Kanishka and Ms successors in Ytisufzai proper. The capital was no more Pushkalavat! or Shahbazgarhl, Those districts", and the country further to the north, where the Gandhara school of art had had a richer development than anywhere else, were no more in the centre of political activity. Peshawar, on the high road to the stronghold of the Kushanas in BadakshSn,1 had become the most important city in the west, and the route from Taxila to Peshawar did not lead through Ynsufzai, That country had been reduced to be an out-of-the-way territory, where Buddhist civilization and art remained, but .where political vicissitudes were of little importance. No wonder that the indigenous donors and sculptors went on using the old era, tin disturbed by the accession oi Kaxjishka.

They are oblong in shape and haee four faces of writingin all, the .first and the last beiag blank on the outer sides. They hare no rims worth the name ; still the writing is in good preservation.

The knob is about 1|" long and is a miniature representation of the kalasika seen on the top of the broad umbrella nsed in the South Indian temples. The plates are a little drawn out in tie side margins and have therefore slightly rounded corners. They measure about 8" in breadth and 8i' in height. The weight of the set is 72 tolas. The plates weqe found in a village called Antirigsm in, the Purbakhanda division of the Ohatrapur taluk, not far from Jauguda, in a, tield while ploughing." 
The language of all the records is Sanskrit written in the Nagari character influenced by the Oriya style more conspicuously in charter K than the three others which closely resemble one another not only in characters, but in the phraseology used in them' All the records as usual are divided into three portions, the first and the third -in verse, the former recordingthe invocations to the family god and the genealogy of the king and the latter benedictions and imprecations quoted from religious books, while the second or the 
middle portion in prose deals with the business in hand. There is also a HttEe prose at the end of the records giving the names of the messenger, the writer, the engraver and the seal-affiser The first portion being composed by a learned man of the court once for all daring the currency of a reign, is always ornate and so it is. in the present grants. The second is usually full of mistakes, as business respects neither rhetoric nor grammar and goes straight to the point, even admitting forms like 8vamisya, Sarmisya, Agnfhotrisya, so long as the sense is not obscured, Imprecations^being mere quotations from Dharaa-Sastras are pure formalities of 
the age, given little care in point of accuracy, though in well written records they receive as much attention as the other parts of the records. In oar records there is ample evidence o* the carelessness with which quotations have been entered. In. some cases the verses are incom 
plete, m others they.lave been mutilated and strung together in a new form, for instance, see J where a verse occurs as, follows :-^* 
which gives a jumble of mis-spellings and misjoinders. 
As regards the peculiarities in writing a full description has been given by Dr. Kielhornin his article on the Orissa plates of Vidyadharabhanja, re-edited by him in Yol. IX, pp. 271 ff in this Journal. His remarks almost wholly apply to the plates H, I and J, and need not be repeated The plates K are more modern than the other three and exhibit more prominently the Ojiya style of writing, the chief characteristic of which is the rounding of the straight or angular por tions into a curve. The plates H, I and J will show that the top lines of letters are not straight but slightly curved, furnishing each letter with a sort of a horn. In K the form of ^gets trans' formed into Q, a ^ into,a ^ into q and so on. These are really Oriya letters. Of course Oriya characters are no other than Nagari letters witli the inevitable rounding resulting from 
an iron stylus playing on palm leaves, which would be torn if straightlines were drawn on, tnem. As u matter of fact the slanting limbs of 'the letters in all these four reoord3 are too pro- minent to require any mention. I would not therefore dilate any further on this point. I shall now proceed to the contents of the records and the historical data they giye tu,.

H grants a village named Ratanga1 in the Vasudevakhanija-vishaya to a number of Aginli5- trins belonging to the Kausika- and VatBa-#Wr#*. The plate I grants a village named Hack chha4&g^anisb of the MachM4&khanda to another donee of the Vatsya-#otfra. These t-vro records do not give either the residence of the donees or the place whence their forefathers came, nor do the;/ state the occasion on which they were granted. They state as usual that the gifts ivere made for increasing the religious merits of the king's father, mother and self. They do not refer to any date whatsoever, but simply saythat they were issued at the king's own ortler and written by the Minister for peace and war, in the case of H by SavarSja and in the case of I by Ktifoera. Both were incited by a goldsmith (akskasatika) named Durgadeva. The seal in Hwas affixed by Mamma, apparentlya short form of Mahamaya (the queen) and in I a lady, named Jacbchhika of the noble family. The messenger for H was Bhatta Sumangala, bur the name of that in I is not legible* 
The charter J was issued by Maharaja VidyMharabhafijadeva, surnamed Amoghakalasa? 8on of Silabhanjadeva, grandson of Digbtianjadeva and great-grandsonof Banabhafijadeva* It was issuer! from the ancestral capital Vanjulvaka and records the grantof a Tillage named MtilamEohhada (?>.., Machhada proper)situated in the MachhSdakhanda-vishaya to Bhatta Ptarandara, an emigrant from ManmSna, situated in the district Tadisama-vishaya in 
Vsrebdhi2 fprovince). In this case as in the previous two, the gift was made for increasing the religions merit of the donor and his parents and bears no date. The record was composed by Stambh*), the Minister for peace and war, and incised by the goldsmith KtunSrachandra, and the seal was affixed by Trikalinga-MahSdevi, on the record being apparently presented by the Prime Minister Bhatta Kesavsdeva. One ChScMka is recorded as the vargulika which appears to be an alternative term for dutaka or messenger.8 All these names occur in plate F except the last, with a medley of offices, which throw a doubt on its genuineness, bat thiw is susceptible of being explained,as would appearlater on* The last charter K was issued in t&ef 3rd year (of the king's reign) on the llth day of the bright fortnight of theKSrtika month (known also as Prabsdhim IlkadaSl), the day on which Vishnu awakes from his four months* sleep, granting the village Komyana of VodS-vishaya to the astrologer Jagadhara-Sarman, resi dent of Pattavadaptaka, situated in the district of Kontaravanga-vishaya, emigrant from VapablmmJL situated in the middle of TMh&ra-vishaya by Yasalbtoanjadeva, eon of Bya bhafija XI, who was son of "VJrabliafija, wbo was son of Bayabhafija I, who was son of the Bajadhiraja Devabhanja, styled SamaBta-Khinjali-dti'Sdhipatior lord of the whole Khifijali country, which connects him with the family headed by SilabhanjadSva, from whom the kings referred to in the precedingthree (H, I, J) records, were descended. Though KhinjaE is not mentioned in the three foregoingrecords in hand, it finds a mention in A, B and C. In the latter there is a mention of Ubhaya-KhiiajaU-mandala which shows that the Khinjali was divided into two mandalas or divisions, though owned by the same king. The records, howerer, do not; show how D^vabhanja, the original ancestor of Yagabhanja'8 family, was connected with the 
parental stock to which all the kings mentioned in plates A to J appearto belong. From these eleyen4 records of the Bhanja family the followingtentative genealogy5 may be made out ; *[E. B.

Similarly H1A Is a rock, but with bhanja added, it makes its wearer *the breaker of rocks'. Sana is "battle, but a kingis no battle;he is Ranabhanja, the <conqueror in battle*. Dis are the 4 or 10 quarters. Obviously the king cannot be dis^ but i* is a great compliment to him to be called Digbhanja,the'victor of all the quarters'. There is only one name in that line which appearsto be self-sufficient without the bhaftju and that is VIdyadharabhanja found in two plates (F and J) where in each case the last letter ra is absent which, however, is supplied by the seal attached to the charter F, By the way I may here note that the king had the title of'AtnGghakalafia ', which was conjee barally read by Dr. Kielhorn as DbarmmakalaSa, owing to an over-engravingin the part where the epithet occurred. It was natural for him to read it as such, on the analogyof Kalayanakalasaattached to the name of Netribhanja, especially as the last letter looked like double *i, which was apparently meant for 0&. Dr. Kielhorn has clearly shown that plates F are palimpsests, but what is most curious is that the alterations are most prominentin the names o the donor, bis title and his ministers. Plates J shosv that the Prime Minister was Bhatta Keavadeva> who presented the charter to the queen for affixing the royal seal, and that the composerof the charter was Btamblia, the Minister for peace and war, in whose office it appearsthat such records used to be prepared. In plates F the offices are reversed, whereby KSSava becomes Minister for peace and war, while Stambha becomes the Mantri.1 The alterations were so carelessly made that Khambha (the popular form of Stambha) continued to be shown as Minister for peace and war and; as such the writer of the charter. This led Dr. Kielhorn to supposethat Stambha and Khambha were different names, occupyingthe offices of Mantri and Scwdhi-vigrahika respec tively, while Kesava was put down as a messenger, in view of the fact that BO messenger was mentioned in the record. 
My view of the matter is that the record F was originally prepared duringthe reignof a short-lived king, the immediate successor of SilabhaBja II, but it could not be issued before his death. At this stage Vidyadhara, the youngerbrother of the deceased, was installed, not without a coup d'ttat, which broughtthe Minister for peace and war to prominence causingthe superses sion of the Prime Minister Kesava by Stambha for the time being. The accession of Vidyadhara to the throne must have been an occasion for munificent gifts and apparentlythe charter $ was issued in hot haste, with necessary corrections, thoughnot very carefully carried out as * Oar record J wh:ch has no signs of being tamperedwith at all reads as follows at the end :

This would also ueroiint for the peculiar name Vidyadhiira as Silabhanja IPs successor, wlio should have been m the ordinary course named as Digbhanja III, (who should be no other than the deceased cider brother of Vidyadharain the present case),I feel this is rather a wild conjecture, bat until evidence to the contrary is available, there is nothing strange about it. In Orissa the 
<astraic custom of continuingancestral names1 has survived even up to the present d&y. Foriiista-ufe, the Raja of Batnra is either a Sfldhalndeva or a Tribhuvanadeva and I have personally biown three generations, Sir SttdhaludSva, his son Tribhuvanadeva and hijs grandson Sildhaladgya i.jm. In Pal Lalii-5, situated between Bamra and Keonjhar,the Raja is either"Pat Gaufishvara PIP or ''Pat Muni Pal". In the Bhanja family the recurring names appear to have been four* :^.. Sila, Dig, Satru and Rana, and each has had a repetition according to the inscriptions found. There is nothing to prevent the discovery of a third name-sake of any or all of thorn. 
There are a number of geographical names in the records which have been yet found, but no serious attempt was ever made to identify tlieni. Iu an appendix to this article I have tried to identify not only places mentioned in the four records in hand, about which. 1 I,a-ve added a special note in the end, "but also those mentioned in charters previously edited.

the mountainous high lands," These are natural divisions which must have, existed, as they do to-day, during the Bhanja rule, and the word"ubhaya"meaning* both' found in the records in connection with Ktdfijali not only justifiesits use, but affords a clue for the identifica tion of the country. Local chroniclers also supportthe fact that Keonjhar was ruled by the Bhanja Rajas. Hunter's Gazetteer1plainly records :"Keonjhar State originally formed part of Morbhanj, but about 200 years ago, the tribes of this part, findingit a great hardship to travel through the perilous forests of Morbhanj to obtain justice from their prince, separated themselves and set up the brother of the Morbhanj Rajaas their independentruler/* That is   
to say, Keonjhar separated from the parental stock less than 300 years ago and was part or the Mayurabhanja State where many of the Bhanja inscriptions were incised. The records shW that there were about three capitals of the Bhanja kings,either co existing or at different periods of their rule. D. and E., the oldest records as noted before, give Khijingga or Khijjinga as the residence of the king, This is identical with the present Khiching to the west of Baripada, the present head-quartersof the MayurabhaiajaState* It still contains numerous ancient remains about which Eai Sahib Nagendra Nath Tasu re marks :"The superior workmanship of these has indeed been a startling discoveryfor us. The faces of the goddesses beam with radiant smiles which .seem to be a realization on" stone o the best dreams of poets and artists. The smiles look as fresh and soft as newly-blown buds and illustrate that motherly grace which is a pure Indian conception and is quite distinct from what we find in the Italian, painter's Madonna." 2 A., B. and C. refer to Dhritipura as the old capital which ia untraceable. !% G., H., I. and J. were issued from Vafijulvaka and as the villages mentioned in them are all found in the Ganjam district, it is perhaps not unfair to conclude that Yanjulvaka was also' situated within that district. The name connotes a superabundanceof cane plants, for which the Ganja.m district is noted. The last record, K., mentions no capitalait all. In spite of the extensive area occupied by the Bhanja family and its branches, it, however, appears that they were not the "sovereignlords of the country theyruled. The original an cestor of the family appears to have been an officer of some China, or Hiudu republic, as Ms title Ganadanda indicates. The title was apparentlya short form of Qan(idan$a-n&yaT(aor* fiono danda-pala$ the former being equivalent to a Minister and the latter to an officer in charge of tlie maintenance of the army.3 There are numerous instances of ministers or army officers becoming kings, whenever they found the administration over them weak* Traditions of a strong member of the democracy usurpingthe powerof government and finally becoming king are not wanting in the Orissa Janapddasas thepolitical ^communities were called in olden days of which the Athmallik State is an excellent example.It was ruled by eight representa tives of the people by turns, which gave it the name of Athamallika (thetract ruled by eight). It is not very far away from Mayftrabhanja. What wonder that Vlrabhadra and his descen dants should have seen their opportunity and become the sole masteis of their .politik^l community. Judging from the titles of the inBcriptional kingsof this line, however, it does not appear that they ever attained to paramount sovereignty, and as such they must have become the HantjaUkas of the MahaksSala kings, firstly of the Ssmavamsis of Viniiapura (Binka) and later on, of -the Haihayas of Eatanpur,both of whom bore the title of Trika lingadhipati or"Lord of the Trikalingas/' which, apparently, included the Orissa Tributary Mahals. The omission, in the grants,of references to any sovereign power, however, indicates that the Bhanjas enjoyed much extended powers and were at anyrate semi-independent chiefs,

There is no record of any conquest made by them, tbo eulogistic epithetof 
added to the name of YagaWmfija being ambiguous.It may mean' the conquerorof JagadSka rnalta'or 'the one warrior and conquerorin the world '^ It, however, seems that the ESme of the Bfaanja dynasty were connected with the Southern Jaipur instead of the Northern Jaipur of Eajputana,to which local chroniclers connect them, in the wake of all Rajputs, who consider it an honour to link themselves with the country regardedas the true home^ol the Kshatriyas. The Jaipur Zamindar, formerly a Raja, who still holds an estate covering about ten thousand square miles, relates that the predecessorsof his family belongedto SilSvamfe,* and we know from the Buguda3 and Saganka's charters* that the family of Sllddbhavas or SailOdbhaTas (bornof rock or hill) were ruling on that side about the 7th *century A.D, It sent out its scions to different partsof the country, one of whom settled in the Vmdhyas in the Central Provinces and conquered many countries round about, as reTealed by the Bagholi plates,5 the only record yet found about that branch. Another adventurer, apparently, settled in MaytrabhaSja. The date of the advent of the Mayfirabhanja conqueror, as related in local chronicles OX, 1,300 years ago),6verywell fits in with the^dates of the 
imcriptional Siladbhavas, and the family has more than one Bhanja named after Sila. In fact, the oldest ancestor found in the inscriptionis named Silabhanja. Distinguished Indian families usually seek for supernatural origins. As is well known, Rajputs claim descent direct from the Sun or the Moon. This may look edifying, but they have pushedthe matter 80 far as ta make it ridiculous. Some trace their origin from au inanimate object or an animal of any kind whatsoever, because such an origin implies some miraculous power.It mystifies the real origin which lurks beneath it and which might cause a blush in its bare nakedness. Here is, for instance, the originof the SilQdbhayas as recorded in the Buguda7 platesof Madhava Tarman :"There was a personage named Pulindasena, famous amongst the people of Kalinga. He, although endowed with many excellent qualities, did not covet sovereignty for himself, but rather worshipped Brahma in order that the god might create a fit ruler of the land. And Brahma granted his wish and created out of a rock the lord Silfldbhava, who became the founder of a distinguished family." Laid bare, the story would show that the dwellers of the local mountains or rock produced a personyL who became the ruler and as such the founder of a dynasty. In editing the Bagholi platesI have shown how SailavarixSa wsa patronymic and how the metronymic of the same family was Gangavam^a. The dynasty was thus the outcome of a mountaineer husband and a river-born wife (the sacred Ganges), which was delicately turned into a compliment, when describing the local river SalimS on whosobank KdBgeda, the capital of their kings, was situated.7 * c On its banks covered with flowers 
of excellent trees," said the eulogist,"poolsof water have formed resembling the river of gods (GfaAgi), which issued from the sky and the streams of whose waters are split- and dashed out side by masses of rocks.*'8 Bereft of the allegory, this would signify that a brave mountaineer of 0rissa married a QrangavamM lady and their son became the founder of a new dynasty. Byasimilar procesB the A^davamSa family waa evolved from a pea-hen's egg. A scion of the SaQavaiha left his parental home and went to the country where peacocks (Maylira) abounded, which gave to the people of that locality the appropriate name of Mayftrikas,9 as foundia the Eijim stoneinscription of Jagapaladdva. He defeated them and thus Tbecama the Mayflrabhanja (breaker of Mayfrras) and in due course married a Mgynrki, a local lady, whose

Postscript. 
It was after I had Rent my article to the Government Bpigraphist on 6th May 1923 "that I received a letter from Mr. McLeod Smith, Dewan of Mayurabhanja State, dated 21st May 1923, in which, besides giving certain local information in replyto my queries, he was good enough to add that in 1916 a copper-plate grant was found at Khandadeuli in Pargang Khanta Pir of tie Bamanghati sub-division, and was publishedin the 4th volume of the Journal ofthe Bihar and, Orissa Research Society which I had not consulted at all. This led to a research which brought to ligM as many as three other grants3 of the Bhanja family, published byMr. B* 0. Maaumda* in Vol. II of the Journal, and a genealogyof the same dynastyas given by Mr. E. D. Banerji in the 3rd volume of the same Journal. Had these been before me when I. was drafting the above article, the discussion in it would have assumed a somewhat different form, but it is now too late to recast it. I would, therefore, note here the salient pointsafter inserting new names of kingsin the genealogicaltable on page286 above, and some geographical names 
in the Appendix, which deals with identification, of places. For facility of reference letters L.? M, K.,0. and P. have been givento these records as follows :

(awaiting publication). 
Only two records, M. and 0., give new names of kings ;M. gives Kanakabhanja,son of Durjayabhanja, who was son of SolanabhaSja. They belongedto the Bhanja^branchruling at 
Bandit and were possibly connected with SatrubhanjaII and his son BanabhanjaII of A., R5 C., L., N, and P. The Plate 0. gives Narendrabhanja,son of Ppthvlbhanja,son of Ba^Waanja I, son of Kottabhanja, descended from Vlrabhadra, the original ancestor of the Bhanjas. 
In dealing with Plate M,, Mr. Mazumdar has given a lengthydiscussion on the dates of fche Bhanja grantsin general, and has come to the following conclusions : 
(1) The presentchiefs of Mayurabhanja and KeonjliarStates have no connection with the 
inscriptional Bhanjas. 
(2) There were several offshoots of the early Bhanjas, of whichone ruled at Baudh and had under its sway the Baudh and Kimidi tracts duringthe times of gatnibhanjaII. These split up during the reignof his son Ranabhanja II, who remained a feudatoryat Baudh, while a descendant of KetribhanjadSvaestablished a new line of rulers at KimidL 
(3) Kanakabhanjaflourished about 1475 A.D, His line was independentof EanabhaSja II,

Mr. B. D. Banerji, reviewingMr. Mazumdar's discussion, declared the date assigned to KaBakabhanja as absolutely impossible on pateographical grounds.' We cannot,' he said, 'admit the existence of. a Rauabhanja in 1200 A,D., because the Ba$abhanja of the 'Banian ghati grant1 was livingin the third quarterof the llth century, according to Mr. Mazumdar, and palaeography shows that KanabhaSja (II), son of Satrubhanja (II),is earlier thau Rana bhanja (I), son of Digbhanja (I). Mr. Banerji would place Kaiiakabhanja in the beginning of the 12th century A.D.' 
It -would thus appear that the Bhanja chronology still remains a subject of great contro versy, but, althoughI do not find sufficient reasons in supportof Mr. Mazumdar's theory dissociating the presentfamilies of Mayurabhanja and Keonjhar States from the mscriptional Bhanjas by relegating their originto an adventurer of Rajputana,I agree with him as regards the date of Ranabhanja II, about the end of the 12th century A.D., until Mr. R. D. Banerji establishes his contention, for which he says he is ready. Kaiiakabhanja may or may not have been very far removed from RanabhaSja II;but the mere fact that Kanakabhanja's two ancestors only are mentioned in Plate M. does not warrant the conclusion that his grandfather was not connected with the Bhanjas known to have been previously ruling at Baudh, Jt is true that the Bhanja family sent out several offshoots and they became rulers of different tracts, but .at present there is nothing to show that Kanakabhanja's line was a distinct one and supplanted Ranabhanja IPs. Again, the adoption of the Kasyapa-g^ra in placeof the old fcAndaja'or egg-born is no proofof disparityin view of the accepted rule thatfi he who has 110 gdtra belongs to the Kasyapa-$3ra.' K^nakabhanja belonged to a much later date than his original ancestor. He must ha^e noticed the contempt with which the origin from an egg musthave been looked upon in his time, The easiest thing for him or his immediate predecessors was, therefore, to relegate themselves to the sage Kasyapa, to which nobody could raise an objection. 
By a misreading of the word Kfcumjali as Khiiidioi or Khinjini Mr. Mazumdar was led to identify it with Khimidi aud consequently to the conclusion that a branch of the Bhanja family held sway there. In essence he is not veryfar from the truth, in that a branch belonging to the line of Netribhanja did rule in the Ganjani District, the eastern portionof which wascertainly under the Bhanja sway,as a number of villages granted were situated in the GumsSr,Aska and Chatrapur taluks to which Kimidi in the same district adjoius towards the west, Kimidi may or may not have been included in the Bhanja dominions, but it was certainly not of such an importance as to have induced the kings to adopt the title ofc Lords of Kirnicii5 Thetitle* Lords of both the Khinjalis (Keonjhar)'was an ancient one, and all the branches of the" Bhanja family appear to have taken pridein calling themselves as such, irrespective of whether they continued to be rulers of that tract or not, 
.With due deference to the learned MahamahSpadhyaya Haraprasad Sastri, M.A., CJ.E,, whohas edited the charter O., which he calls; Khandadeuli inscriptionof UanabhanjadSva/ I mayperhaps be permitted to state that his descriptivetitle is inaccurate. The grant should havebeen described as one of Narendrabhanjadeva, who was the real grantor and not his grandfather Eanabhanjad.eva. The latter comes in merely as one of the several ancestors of the donor. The? text reads :3

804 BPIGBAPHIA INDIOA, [Yoi.XVIII, No. 30. THE MWGIB PLATE OF DEVAPALADEVA : SAMVAT 33, BY LIONEL D. BABNETT.   
This charter was first publishedin the year 1788, in Vol. I of the Asiatic^ Researches, p. 123 it where a lithographic reproduction and an attemptat translation. were presented. About that time the plate disappeared. In 1892 the late Professor Kielhorn republishedthe text with a corrected translation in the Indian Antiquary,Vol. XXI, p. 254 ff,, on the basis of the edition in the AsiaticJc Researches ; as will be seen, h^ accomplished the task with his wonted skill and success. But no trace of the original plate could be found. 
Recently, while repairs were being made in Kenwood House, a dirty and discoloured metal plate inscribed with Indian characters was found hidden away between a beam and the roof. It was broughtto me for identification, and I at once recognisedit as the long-lost charter of Devapaladeva. Then Mr. Plenderleith, of the Science Laboratory attached to the British Museum, came to my aid and skilfully removed the accumulated grime and rust of many gene rations, so that it is now restored to its original condition, a fine and almost perfectly preserved specimen of medieval Indian metal- work. It seemed desirable to publish a photographic facsimile with 'an emended transcriptionof the text, and I have been permittedto do this by the kindness of the EightHonourable the Earl of Iveagh, GLC.V.O,, Senior Trustee of the Kenwood Estate. 
The plate is of thick copper, measuring 18|inches in height and 13| inches in width. Onthe top of it is soldered a sealr 6|inches high and at the base 7| inches wide ; in the central panel of this is the well-known Sarnath device, the dharma-ckaJcra with two antelopes at the sides, under which is the royal name, $rl-Devapaladevasya.It is in excellent preservation: with the exception of a very few unimportant syllables, the characters are as cleanly cut as wheii the plate 
came from tEe engraver's hand. The script is typicalof the region and date ; the letters are about & of an inch in height*It is needless to treat of the contents, as theyare fully discussed IB Kielhorn's paper. 
The main partof this document, scil. from the beginningto hart/a iti, L 46, is duplicated in 11. 1-42 of the Nalanda plate publishedin Ep. Ind., Vol. XVII, p. 310 fit. The divergences are few and slight, and I have onlynoticed the more important,

No. 31. TEKKALI PLATES OF DANARNAVA'S SON INDRAVARMAN. BY E: H0i/rzscH> PH.D. ;HALLE 
Ink-impressions of this inscription6 were kindly made over to toe by Rao Bahadur H. Krishna Sastri. The plates belong to Sri L. N. Deb, Esq., Tubraj of Tekkali in the Ganjam District 
of the Madras Presidency. These are"three copper-plates,each measuring about 5" i*x breadth and 2f*in height, and strung on a ring of the same metal. The first plateis in scribed only on the Inner face, and the third plate bears only one line of writing on the outer face The plates do not appearto have tad raised runs. The ringis 3* in diameter and is ixed in a circular weal measuring*in diameter, on which is engraved the worn figure of a standing bull with raised hump, facing the properleft. The three plates, with ring and seal, weigh60 tolas.'* 
The siting on the platesis in a state of very good preservation. The alphabet resembles that of other early grantsof the Gangas of Kalinga. The letters ur and * have the same shape as in tte majority of them, while in one of the grantsof Indravarman7 the ?r closely resem bles the ?r. The jihvamuUya is employedin line 18, and the upadhmaniyafive times. A final form of m occurs in line 27. The group <a! is written correctlyin line 10, but is expressed by w in lines 3 and 81. In line 30 occur the numerical symbol 100 and the two decimal figures 5 and 4. The language of the inscriptionis on the whole very correct Sanskrit prose, with three verses'sung by Vyasa ', quotedin lines 26-20. Line ^contains a few Dravidian words (amba-achchi-pfyi). 
The date of this inscription (1. 30 is the year 100 54=154 ; i.e. the first of the three figuies is expressed by the numerical symbolc 100 ', and the two remaining figures are decimals. This fresh dote induced me tore-examine the yearof theChicacole platesof Devendravarman, son of CkUjariiava, which I had originally read as 100 80 3. Kielhorn noted already that the middle figure is certainly not the numerical symbol80 ', but the decimal'8 . The third figureof tbe 
resemble the usuaHorm of'3'5 but, to the date is recorded also in words, it nm** ear- , be meant for '8'. Bflhler solved this little problemin a very ingenious manner by explaining

The day of the same grant consists of the decimal figure'2'followed tv a cipher /0)=20. If we now re-examine the date of the Purle plates of Indravarman, son t f Mnarnava,' the year turns out to be (not 100 40 9, but) 100 37=137, and the day 2O =20; awl the year of one of the Chicacole plates of Indravarman is not 100 40 6,3 but 100 38=138'ad its day is lOh (still expressed by a numerical symbol). If we go back to the other Cmratole plates of Indravarman,* we nd that both the second figure of the year and the first

The executor (ajna) of this grant was the Mahamahattara Haiiflarman (1. 29 f.). The donee was a Brahmana named Skanda6arman (L 17), who lived at GarakliSnna (1. 15). The royal donor was Danarnava-'s son, the Kalinga king Indravarnoan of the Gfiftga family, who issued this edict from his residence of Kalinganagara. He seems to have made the grant for the spiritual merit of his mother Achcliip6ti (1. 14). The grant was made at an eclipse of the sun (1. 15) in the year 154 (of the Ganga era) (1. 30). It consisted of a field at the vittaga of Turiganna (1. 11) or Tungana (L 21) in the district of RttpyavatS (1. 11). 
I am unable to identify either the village grantedor its boundaries (11. 18-22), But the Rfipyavatl-w's&az/a (1. 11) may be connected with the [Rujpavarttani-wAaya1 which con tained the village of Sellada. For, accordingto Mr. G. Bamadas,3 this village belongsto the Tekkali Taluk, and the subjoined grantis preservedat Tekkali.

No. 32. TEKKALI PLATES OF RAJENDRAVARMAN'S SON DEVENDRAVARMAN, 
By E. HULTZSCH, Ps.D. ; HALLE (SAALE). 
These plates belong to Sri Gopinath Deb, Esq., Second Prince of Tekkali in t&$ fiaijaim District of the Madras Presidency. Ink-impressionsof them were kindly forwarded to me by Rao Bahadur H. Krishna Sastri. These are"three copper-plates, each measuring about 6^" high and 2f"broad, and strung on a ring of the same metal. The first plate bears writing only on the inner face. All the inscribed faces appear to have had raised rims, which are now worn out. The ringis about 3Jf' in diameter and is fixed in a circular seal measuring1J*in diameter 
The seal is much damaged and broken on one side. It bears the figureof a seated bHf facing the proper left. Below the bull is a lotus, of which only three petals are now visible* The three plates, with ring and seal, weigh85 tolas." 
The writing on the platesis fairly well preserved and distinct, except where it has been-wil fully tampered with by some person who erased and changed certain topographical andper&onal names which the inscription must have contained originally. The alphabet closely resemble* that of the Alamaiida platesof the year 304s The language is very barbarous Sanskrit prose, with two equally faultyverses*sung by VySsa'3 which are quotedin lines 24-27* 
The inscription4 records the grantof a village by the worshipperof the god Gdkar^a-svatain (L 5} on the Mahindra mountain (1. 2 f.) and the ornament of the spotless family of the G-angas, the Maharaja Devindravarman, who was the son of the JfaMr5/aBajindravaa>- man (11. 12-14). He addressed this edict from his residence of KalMgaaaagara (L 2) to the ryota inhabiting a village whose name has been later on erased and replaced by the wc*rd N^J/^M in Nagari characters (L 14). The name of the district in which this village wa& included has also been tampered with, but may have been originally [RUjpavarttant5 The name of the Brih ma^a donee seems to have been erased, but he was apparentlya*good poet*(su-kam) and the som of a'grent doorkeeper'(maMpratihara, L 17).

Line 28 1 contains the date of the inscription.If the compound [iata]-mayS is explained as a clerical error for tato-trayi,it may be translated by :"In the year three~fctmdred and. tin of tte kingdom of growing victory of the Ganga race.'9 Devendravarman, whose subjoined grantis dated in the year 310, might then have been a second son and successor of that Ittjendravaiman whose first son, Anantavarman, issued the Alama^da -plates of the year 304. 1 Tlie two names of the writer (1. 30) and of the goldsmith (akshaSalin) who engraved, the edict (1. 31) remain doubtful and suspicious. 
It will be seen that at presentthis whole document is of very small practicalvalue. But I am publishingit with the hope that, in the light of future discoveries, it may still proveof some use in unravelling the tangled web of the Ganga genealogy and chronology.

ii, 0, where some letters near the end have become illegible. The alphabet resembles that of the Chendalui platesof (the grantor's lather) Sarvaloka&raya (Mangiyuvaraja).1 A final form of m occurs in lines 19, 21, 23, 28 and 30. In Chalikya (1. 4) and yugala (L 7),I is replaced by 19 which letter is also employed in the Telugu genitive Bsla (11 16, 19). The Telugu letter r is used in lines 9, 12 and 14. The language is Sanskrit prose, with four verses quoted on plate iii, a. The Telugu word pow,cgoing,3occurs in the descriptionof the boundaries of the grant 
(L 17), 
The inscription on the platesrecords a gift of land by the Maharaja Sakalalokasraya Jayasimka-VaHabha (L 81), who was the son of the Maharaja Sarvaldk&Sraya (1. 51) and the grandsonof the Maharaja ishnnvardhana who adorned the family of the CfcalLikyas'(L 4 I.)*' The Jayasimha of this grant must be identical with the Eastern Chalukya king JayasixhJia II, who is known to have been the eldest son and the successor of Sarvaloka^raya (Mangiyuvaraja) and the grandson of Vishnuvardhana (II) ; and the subjoined grant is the first of Jayasimha II which has hitherto come to light. 
In line 9 the king"commands all as follows : Be it known to you (that) by us ." This passage was probably copied from old office records and is left incomplete.It is repeated with modifications and completedin lines 12-17, where the king"commands as follows all ryotsin habiting the district (vishaya)of Karma-rashtra : (Be it known to you that)2 on the lull iKioon (titlu) ol Jyaislrtha, at the time of Samkranti, at the occasion of gifts of land (bhtimi-dana), at the request of Gobbadi, in the village named Penukapayu in Karma rashitra,s a field (Jcshetra) in the north-eastern direction of this village has been given (by us)*4 The limit of this field to the east (is) the Nidugatta-tataJca (tank) ; the limit to the south (is) the end of the Pusa-BSla-kshetra;5 the limit to the west (is) the road going to 
; the limit to the north (is) the limit of Maslialdia." 6 After a short lacuna at the end of line 17 the descriptionof the boundaries is continued ;but it is difficult to say whether it refers to the same field as before, or to another. This description ends with the words (L 20 1) :* To the east of the Tala~tataka3 in the southern half, a rice-field measuring four (nivartanqs ?) and ending in the east ;7 on the north-eastern side of the village (the field lies) between hills (I).* The fact that the king granted the field is then stated once more in the first person singular,cI gave away*(pradam, L 23). The inscription ends with the usual threats and imprecations in prose (1L 23-26) and in four verses (11. 26-31). Between the third and fourth verses (L 30) we are informed that the 'executor (ajnapti) of this grant was Niravadya SaJmlaI6kasraya^ This officer was evidently named after his sovereign's surname, Sakalalaka&raya (1. 8).^/The last portion of his title, gamu^in^ is pro bably connected with gamu^a* a tadbham of gramahuta ; ct above, Voi VII, p. 183. His actual name may have been Gobbadi (L 14). 
The descriptionof the donee, Era*rDr6na&arman (L 12),is sandwiched between the two versions olthe passage which records the king's order (1. 9 and L 12 fL)* He was a Brahma^ia ofVangipapu (L 9) and belongedto the Kaun$mya-0^ra, Taittirlya (cham^a) and ipa stamba~*mra (L 10). His father and grandfather were Deva^arman (1. 11) and Gunjadeva^arman" {L 10 respectively).

covered with thin forest vegetation. From here the place calledc< Danam-4ibba"1 ~* the treasure-mound'is readied by a gravelly foot-path running alongthe slope of the hill, which appears to liave Tbeen once providedwith stepsof ruhble stond Struggling two or three furlongs along tliis unwelcome path we come to the crown of the hillock and to the mound * Dhanam- dibba*on it. Here are found the remains of what looks like a BuddMsfc stupa consisting mostly of large- sized bricks and sometimes unhewn stone.3 On the southern side of the mound are seen also portionsof a- structure built of cut and dressed stone. The four rock cut wells on tlie south, and west sides of the mound, 4 to 5 feet square and 6 to ? feet deep, are of peculiar interest and seem to have been used once for storing water for the use of the occu pants of the Buddhist monastery, as the mound may prove to be when excavations are properly carried out. 
On the north wall of one of the wells on the western side of the mound measuring 5' 8| long by 5' 5|-* broad arid,?72" deep,is engravedin 6 lines the-Andhra inscription, edited below, in BrShml characters of about the 3rd century A.D. This inscription which was publishediu 1908 by Dr. Konow in Z. D. M* (?., Vol. LZII, p. 591 f. has been noticed as No. 1341 by Dr. 
Liiders in Ms List of Bra hmt Inscriptions in VoL 2, above! As remarked by Dr. Stan Konow in the Director- General of Archeology'a, Annual Survey JBejport for 1907-08, p. 225, this is the only lithic record hitherto discovered of the Andhra king Chadasata, who is already known to us from a number of coins found in the Kistna and the Godavari districts. My friend Mr. 0. B. Krishnaraa Acharlu, B.A., of the Madras Epigraphical Departmenthas alsospent^some hours with me in reading the inscription directly from the stone; and the text givenbelow is the joint productionof both of us. The accompanyingfacsimile plateis reproduced from an inked 
estompage prepared under my direct supervision. The inscription thns decipheredwill be seen to differ much from the publishedtext of Di\ Sten Konow, The object of the record, for instance, was not the establishment of the earth-dwelling (bhumi vesa)of an unnamed-minister (amoefta), but was the establishment of the gift (dhama)of a Xha&gu (rock-cutwell ?} bythe minister Sasa of Khaddavali the ancient form of the present Tillage name KodaYali3 
The name of the king occurs in 1. 3 as Cfcamdasati, the lingual 4 being possiblyalso read as a dental" <i But, it is to be noted that the longvertical stem which is requiredtodMingu^ha 
dental d (of. di in 1. 4) is missing here ; again fa may be comparedwith Kha m 1. 4. TtatomChadaMia* occurs clearly on one of the coins published by Eapson. S the f of tf is faintly seen and is practicallycertain. Possibly Mi is a Praknt

likely to have been tlie origin of the later Satakarni than the fanciful sata-karna 'the hundred eared.' 1 But Dr. Konow neither accepts sato, as an abbreviation of $ataJcarni nor does he read fcsvati). He prefers to have the name Chadasata (Chamdasata) without explaining the name-ending sata. 
The date of the record in 11. 3 and 4 has been read by Dr. Sten Konow as"savachare 10 3(?) he pa 3 diva dasame"whereas my reading is"mji vachhare 2* ma 1 he pa 2 di 1" The reading ma 1 after the regnal year is difficult to explain. If this were preceded by he, instead of being -followed by it, it would have yielded the meaning hemantam&sa 1, as we find in a very large number of similar dates coming from Northern India; but, he is required before pa ; for otherwise the latter could not be explained. Besides, the dated Southern Brahm! inscriptions as catalogued by Dr. Liiders in his List of BrShml Inscriptions give only the paksha of the season and in no case the month (masa) as the northern dates do. I can only suggest that in this record both the month and the paksha are given and the word he which is an abbreviation for the season hemanta is placed after ma 1 while it should have preceded it, and thus arrive at the prpbable interpretation of the date as"the first day of the second fortnight of the firsfe month <rf the winter-season,"If this interpretation is right, the '.details of the date woilld correspond to %l%rgatrsha, bahula prathams, somewhere in December 2lO AJX, the second year of CUmtiida-svati.

L. 3. Cham The anusvara is cleanly marked on the left top of the letter as in cl&aA in 1 1, After Chamdasatisa, Dr. Sten Konow read savachhare* But to me it appearsas if tJbert is space enough, for two letters between the sa of Ghamdasatim and mchhare. Perhaps word like raji lias to be read. There are no doubt traces of a* sa to justify the reading jura chhare.

The i mark of di runs into the bottom of ra of raji in line 3 above, thus making tibe latter look somewhat deformed and crooked unlike the other ra-letters in the inscription. 
The letter between dda and li is completely damaged and no traces are seen. It could have "been a ma or a va. As, however, the present village name Kodamli to which there is a wire reference here is spelt with a v, I would prefer takingthe damaged letter as M and not a ma.

No, 33. BETMA PLATES OF BHOJADEVA ; [TIKEAMA-] SAMVAT 1076. 
BY D. B.. DISKALKAR, M.A. ;BAJKOT. 
Though the name of tke Paramara king Bhsjaof Dhara is well known to scliolars, epi grapMcalrecords of Ms reignare rather rare. So far only two grantsof this king have been discovered ; one of Y. S. 1078 in Ujjain1 and the other of V. S. 1076 (Magha, su. di. 5)in Banswara2. The copper-plate grantdealt with here is thus the third known record8 of his reign 
The plates were discovered, about two years ago, bya peasant while ploughing his field near a village called Betma, sixteen miles to the west of Indore, in Central India. They subsequently came into- the possession of Mr. Manekchand Jati of Indore, who takes interest in antiquities. When I had been to Indore sometime agoI found them with him. Through the kindness of the late Bao Bahadur Dr. Prabhakar B. Bhandarkar, Home Member, Holkar State, and of Mr. K. K. Lele, Superintendent, Historical Department, Dhar, I have been able to edit the inscription here for the first time. 
The plates, which are two in number, are held together by two thick copper rings in the usual way. They measure 13 inches in length and 8finches in breadth, and are in anexcellent state of preservation. The inscribed side of the second plate bears at its bottom in a rectangular border a flying figureof Garada as is usuallyseen in the Paramara grants. The sign annual of the kingis affixed at the Snd of either plate. It is to be noted that in none of the known grants of Bhajadevathe name of the writer of the grantis given. 
The alphabet is Nagari of the llth century A.D. prevalentin Malwa, as known to us fromthe other records of the period, e.g. the Banswara plates of the same king. The consonant 3is expressed by q throughout. In fact, there is nothingto distinguish between the letters 
*T, V and if. U is wrongly replaced by ^r in ftWT (1. 1), *ftfow (L 14), (I 21) and m TO: (L 23). Similarly^ is wrongly replaced by SI in IJTO^ft (1- and in 3PR9T (1. 25). A consonant followingr is generally doubled, e.g.in ^fa (1- 1), 
0- 7), *rf; (L 9), fofipfcT 0- la), T|fasr*T (I. 19),etc. ^ at the end of a conjunct consonant is generally expressedin this inscription bythe full letter added below the first consonant (e.g. tra 11. 8, 14 and 15, dra L 5, bhra 11, 8, 9, gra 1. 9, etc.), and not by a stroke turned to the left as we generallyfind. The letter "kri in the two cases where it occurs (11, 1 and 16)is written imperfectly, the left portionof the letter fca being omitted. The document is drawn upin Sanskrit prose mixed with verses. 
Except'for the following four points, our grantis practically identical with the Banswaragrantof the same king issued in the s&me year: 
(1) Though the yearin both the grants is the same, the months are different. The Betmagrantis dated on the 15th day of the bright fortnightof the month Bhadrapada,while the Banswara grantis dated on the 5fch dayof the bright fortnight of the month Magha. It is to be seen, however, which is the earlier of the two grants.If we consider the year as beginning with the month Chaitra, the Betma grant may be the earlier one. If, however, the year

s Mr, K. N. Dikshit informs ine that another record of the reignof Bhoja dated Samvat 1091 (1Q34-& A,D,) has been traced on an image of Sarasvat! which has found its way to fche British Museum. I also find that the Tilafcwa<Ja plates of V. S. 1103 published by the late Mr. Kudalkar in the Proceedin$# oftie First Oriental Conference, Poona, most probably belongto therein of thia Bhoja, Due more copper-plate grant of Bhojadeva fca# recently been discovered at Ka!yan in the Naaik District.

began with the month. Karttika, as ia thg> present usagein Malwa and Gujarat, ttten it must be looked upon as the later of the two. We have reasons to hold that -the latter supposition iB correct for, as has been already pointed out by Prof. Kielhom,1 in the rant of * 
Bhojadeva of V. S. 1 078, ttie expression 
i.e. on the third day of th dark half of Magha in the year 1078, occurs m the middle of the grant and probably 'gives the date when the donation was made. At the end of the grant the date of its issue is givenas the 14th day of the brighthalf of the month Chaitra of Samvat* 
1078. If Magha of 1078 preceded Chaitra of 1078, the year must have commenced from some month previousto Magha and ended subsequent to Chaitra. We can, -therefore, 'assume that the Samvat year beganthen as now in the month of Karttika. The Banswara grant which is dated in the month Magha of V. S. 1076 (Jan. 1020 A.D.) is, therefore, earlier than the BetmS 
grant which is dated in the month Bhadrapadaof the same year, i.e. 1076 (Sept. 1020 A,D,j. (2) The occasions when the two grantsof Banswara and Beting,, were made are different, In the former grantit is givenas 3fff^wf%^^^f^vwhile in the latter it is given as Dr* Hultzsch, who edited the Banswara grant3,translated this'historiU 
cally important expressionas' the anniversary of the conquestof Komkana/ But it is to be noted that the period intervening between these two grants, which record almost an identical expression, is only seven months and ten days. Mr. D. R. Bhandarkar who edited the- -same grant3 I think gives a better translation of the expressionas"on the festival day (jparvani) 
in consequenceof the conquestof Komkana." The expressionin the Banswara grant means thafc ' Bhoia conquered Konkana* and thafc in the BetmS grant means perhaps* that he occupiedit.* In the Balagamve inscription4 of thfe time of the Chalukya Jayasimha, dated Saka 941 (Decem ber 1019 A.D.),it is stated that Jayasimha had'putto flight the confederacy of Milava \ From this we can conclude that ivthe- contest for power between -the Malwa Paramaras and the Decean Chalukyasthat was going on for years together, in the first quarter of the eleventh century AD.,both the parties were gAcceasful by iurns. Soon after his accession, Bhfrfa must have invaded the Decean to avenge th* execution of hia uncle Vakpati-M^Sja by the ChSlukya king Tailapa, and he probafclf succeeded in defeating and killing Tatlapa's successor, Vikramaditya Y.5 When Jayasimha <pame to th throne in 1015 A.D. he must have retaliated by inflicting a crushingdefeat on BhQja and his confederacy sometime before December 1019 A.D. Bhoja apparentlydid npt take longto recover. He invaded the territory of Jayasithha and conquered Konkana, in Janttary 1080 A.D., which was-finally annexed to his empire sometime before September1020 A*D. From the Miraj plates6 it seems that Bhoja could notjetain Ms possession for longas Jayasipiha reconquered Konkana before the year 1024 AD. (Saka 946) and took into his possession* the wealth of the Lords of the Seven Koakanas '. 
(3) The granteein the present inscriptionis a .Brahmana named Pandita Delha, son of Bhatta ThatthasiKa of the Kausika-gStfra with the three pravaras Aghamarsha$a, Visvlmitra and KauSika "and of the Madhyaadina-a*M. He hailed from Stli8,nvigvaraf but his anoe h^d come from the village VisalagrSma.

As regards the identification of the localities mentioned in the grant it is ttf be said that SthinVWvara is no doubt the Thanesar of modern times situated in the Karnal District of the Punjab, The Nyayapadra (subdivision) of the grant may be the town Napad in the Eaira Diatrict^a little to the south-west of Indore; (and. the gift village Nalatadaga is probably represented bythe modern Nlr (Nal)in the same district.

That officer oommimi- <satod the news of the discovery throughthe Executive Engineer, Poona District, to the Superintendent of the Archaeological Survey, Western Circle, who secured good impreesuwi of all of them.

No. 37. INSCBIPTION ON A VISHNU IMAGE FEOM DEOPANL 
BY K. N. DIKSHIT, M.A. 
This inscriptionof four lines occurs on the side of a stone image of Vislxnu, which was found 9 along with another partially broken and obliterated image of Durga, in the jungle close to the"1 IDeopani river (Sibsagar District, Assam) between the 26th and 27th miles on the Golaghat-Dimapur road. As the localityis frequented by wild elephants, to whom the present damaged condition of the images is due, the Vishnu image has been removed by me to Gauhati and deposited for safe custody in the rooms of the Kanirup Anusandhan Samiti. The place was visited by Dr. Bloch in 1904*05, who describes the image as follows in the Annual Report ofthe Eastern Circle :* The second or smaller image 2 feet 6 inches high is a standing Vishnu or Narayana with two hands only (the other two hands on the proper right have been lost) wearing the usual crown and having the r$vaisa mark on his breast. On the left outer face is an inscription in four lines, the end of which, is broken. The broken piece could not be found.* About the inscription, he further writes : 'The inscriptionconsists of three verses of Sanskrit poetry, evidently full of orthographical and grammatical blunders and for this reason difficult to read. The first two verses seem to be in honour of Siva and the third refers to the putting up of a statue of Narayana by some person whose name was on the missing pieceof stone. It is of no historical interest. Judging from the charac ters, it belongsto about the 12th century AJX? As Dr. Bloch's estimate of the age of the inscrip tion is rather wide of the mark, sufficient attention was not drawn to the importance of this image. The characters are similar to the inscriptionof Harjjara on a rock on the bank of the Brahma putra near Tezpur, which is dated in the year 510 of the Gupta Era. The present inscription can be safely attributed to the 9th century A.D. on palseographical grounds, and as the statue is the only ea?ly example of an inscribed image yet known in Upper Assam, it is a landmark in the history of Art in Assam. On grounds of style and execution, the image could easily have been ascribed to the late Gupta or early Pala periodin Bengal. Attention may be drawn to the thick lower lip, the expression of the face, the ear-ornament, the band around the crown, the Brahmanical thread 
and the elose-fitting garment,the style of the Gada and the Vanamala, and the Kaustubha and Srlvatsa symbols, which are all indications of an earlier age not far removed from the late Gupta period- It is worthy of note that the positionof Deopani is intermediate between Dimapur and Kasomsm Pathar where still exist the remains of the peculiar culture associated with the Kicharis IB the shape of monoliths described as*swoid-blade/c chess- man/*Y-shapedf and * buffalo-horneds columns.2T
330 EPIGRAPHIA INDIOA. [Vot. 2TIIL  
The characters are ^cute-argled and belong, to the Eastern variety prevalent in the ninth century A. D. over the larger portion of Northern India. 
The inscription, as was pointed out by the late Dr. Bloch long ago,is full of orthographical blunders and was apparently written very carelessly. A number of letters have been lost at the end of each line, except the fourth. Calculating on the basis of completing, the first two slokas, we find that at least 15 Betters must have been lost in the first line and 11 in the second. Owing to the incompleteness of the record and inaccuracyof the scribe, it is not possibleto. give a connected account of the contents of the inscription. The opening benedictory verse must bs taken as referring to Siva, as it mentions the serpent-girdle, bull emblem and the moon. The purport of the second verse, -which probably commences in the second line and ends in the third, is very obscure. The end of the last line seems to refer to a stone image of the divine Narayana.

Mr. K. V. Subralimanya Aiyar for many suggestions, and for the kind encouragement givento me in preparingthis paper. 
The slab on which the inscriptionis engravedmeasures 8' 2" by 2' 6". There are 49 lines of writing on it. The stone had been planed and ruled before the letters were engraved. Thewritiag, which has been well executed, is in a fairly goodstate of preservationthe averagesize of th letters being about 1 inch in height The characters used in the record are Grantha and Tamil They agree, on the whole, with those of the Tamil inscriptionsof the contemporary Ch5J kings on the mainland of South India. The following facts, however, are noteworthy. The jmgior vii&ma sign, which is generally not used in most of the Tamil inscriptionsin the South India of the medieval age,is here invariably indicated by a small vertical stroke, written over the letter, e a invali vanda (\. 1). The cmvwSra is generally written over the letter, at its top. The first five lines consist of a Sanskrit verse in the gardulaviJcrliita metre, and the rest of the inscription 
is in Tami* prose, where, however, "there is a great admixture of Sanskrit words._ In tV Sanskrit portion the rules of *m&i have not been observed in one place,i.e. Jra^tf-r* "r It MnLsting to note that, in the Tamil passage,the following old Sutfxalese word are used with Tamil inflexions in some cases :

65 years, and passed his 73rd birthday (tirunaksTiatram).1. It next mentions the building of ashrine for the Tooth. Relic of Buddka in the monastery of Uturolmula which was a part of the Abh.ayagiri-viliara by a General named Diva, at the command of the king. We are next intro duced to the royal preceptor Vyaricd Mugalan, who is described to have been well versed in all the sciences and scriptures, and who was a high dignitaryof 'the Buddhist Church in Ceylon at this period. This hierarch, as our inscription informs us, convened a meeting of the chief minis ters of the state, and inviting the Velaikksbpa forces to their presence, exhorted them to protect the temple of the Tooth. The Velaikkaras, who consisted of the three divisions of the Malia tantra, the Valafijiyar, and the Nagarattar, agreed to do so, and re-named the temple as Munru-kai'tiru- Velaikkaran-Daladay-perum-palU, and concerted the necessary arrangements for the protection of the shrine. They bound themselves not only to protect the temple, its lands, its serfs, property, etc., but also to keepit in proper repair and to do everything necessary for its proper maintenance. The inscriptionalso gives a list of the various tribes which formed the Vejaikkajas and ends with an imprecation on those who act against the rules laid downtherein. 
The account given in this inscription of king /i~Sanghabodhi Vijayabahu agrees in every detail with that given in the Mahavam&a of Vijayabahu I, So there is no doubt about the identity of the king mentioned in our record. The statement that he had to conquer many ene mies before he could establish his authority, is, no doubt, a reference to the long wars that he had to wage against the Clidla invaders and the petty chieftains of Ceylon who ruled in the south ern part of the island. Perhaps it might not be out olplace, in this connection, to give a brief ac count of the state of the country before the accession of Vijayabahu to the throne, and a short sketch of his career, as stated in the Mahavamta (Chapters LVIII to LX). At the beginning of the eleventh century, in the reign of Rajaraja I, the Cholas invaded Ceylon and annexed the -northern |>art of the island to their dominions, taking MaMnda V, the then king of Ceylon, as a prisoner, to the Chola country. From this time, up to the end of the reign of the Chola king AdMrajendra.- deva, Ceylon acknowledged the supremacy of the Cholas.2 During this period Ceylon was in a state of utter confusion. The Sinhalese princes, driven to the mountainous districts of the South, were always fighting amongst themselves, when the Cholas were not at their doors. When the country was in this distracted state, a young scion of the ancient Sinhalese royal family, namedXirti, raised the standard of war, and after a considerable amount of fighting, made himself the master of the Hdfcana country, the southern part of Ceylon, and assumed the title of Vijayabahu, when he was only seventeen years of age. After making his position secure in the principality of which he was the chief, he started on a campaign to rid the island of foreign domination. Thetime chosen by him for this enterprise was an opportune one. The campaign of Vijayabahu against the Cholas falls into the period immediately before the accession of Kuldttu&ga I to the 
* TirunalcsJiatram means the' sacred asterism.3It seems as if the Sinhalese kings of old celebrated a special festival annually, on the day of the constellation under which they were born. I am informed by Mr. K. V. Subhrahmanya Aiyar, Superintendent for Epigraphy, that such a custom still prevails in the royal family of ^ravancore, and that the princes of Travancore are named after the constellations under which they are born. The Mahavamta also gives instances in which persons were named after the constellation of their birth, e.g. Tishya and Pushya. [The/M a-naa or birth name of a Hindu child is given after the janma-*k*katra or the COM tellation of nativity. Ed.] 
*Inscriptions of Rajaraja I are found in Ceylon, and in one of the records of the Tanjore temple it is stated tkat the income of several villages in Ceylon was dedicated to that shrine. Rajendra-Chola I also says in his in Hcnptions that he conquered the whole island. Rajadhiraja I and Rajendradeva, the successors of Raiendra Chola I, both conducted campaigns in Ceylon, in which several princes of the island are said to have perished, *f S???.10!*f?*to * is al* *>nnd ^Poloanaxum No inscription, however, of anv o* Choja Adhira3ndrais found ou the island of Ceylon,

Choja throne. This was a periodof Civil War in the Chola country, and, consequently, tie Cholas were not able to send sufficient forces to JDeylon to quell the rising there againsttheir authority. In one of the inscriptionsof Kulottunga'at Tirukkajtikkunram,1 he says that he sent several expeditions to Ceylon, but does not mention any definite results gained by them. These were 
most probably,the armies which, accordingto the MaMvamSa, were sent by the Chola king to fight against Vijayabahu.After a long and protracted campaign, Vijayabahu succeeded in -driving the.Cholas out of Ceylon, and made himself the master of the whole island. 
During the Chola occupation, the Buddhist religion had suffered greatly. In fact, when Vijayabahu came to the throne, he found that there were no ordained monks in the island, who would help him in the work of reviving the religion pf the land. Therefore, he sent an embassy to the king of Aramana, requesting him to send properly ordained monks to Ceytyn. The king 
of Aramana at this time was Anuruddha, from whom Vijayabahureceived substantial support in his struggle against the Cholas. The Burmese king sent several properly. ordained monks to the island, and they revived the Buddhist Church in Ceylon, and helped Vijayabahuto restore Buddhism to its pristine glory and splendour.. Our inscription alludes to this event, and, moreover, states that he purified the sanghaof the three mkayas (fraternities), and gavethree tulabliaras to them. The Ceylonchronicles do not mention this fact, though they give a long account of the king's benefactions to the religious establishments, and his various works of 
public utility. 
The Commander-in-Chief Deva, who, at the instance of the king,built a shrinefor^theTooth Belie, is not known to us from other sources. The monastery of Uturolmula, within the pre cincts of which the Temple of the Tooth Belie was built,, and which was itself a partof the Abhayagiri vihara2 at Polonnaruva, must be the same as the monastery of UttarSla which was built TayMana,one of the predecessorsof Vijayabahu I, for his elder brother who had entered the priesthood.8 It is also stated in the Mahavamfa that the king entrusted the guardof the Tooth Belie to him. The Buddhist monk Mugalan, who took an active partin getting the co.nseat.of the VelaikMras to protect the temple,is not mentioned, so_far as I know, in anyof the Ceylon chronicles. 
The next pointto be discussed is, who these Vejaikkaras were, and what their position was in Ceylon,at the time when this inscription was setup. The Velaikkaras are mentioned in the MaMvamta as having formed a partof the army of the Sinhalese kingsof this period. It is stated that' towards the latter partof Vijayabahu's reign, there was a revolt of these troops, when he was making preparationsfor undertaking an expeditionto South India against the Chola king. This rising of the Vgjaikkaras was put down with considerable difficulty, and as a consequenceof it, the projected campaign against the Cholas had to be given up.* Later on, in the reignof Vijayabahu's grandson, GajabaHu II, they again figure in the historyof Ceyton^ There*, it is said, that Gajabahu's rival, FarSkramabahu I, tried tp win them over to his side A few years later, we find the Velaikkaras in alliance with the Kerajas and the peopleof Bofcina, rising in rebellion against the authorityof Parakramabahu I.' These accounts, coupled with the fact that their aid was considered effective for the protectionof one -of the most cherished national treasures of the Sinhalese people, go to provethat the Velaikkaras were, at this, period, & very powerful community.

Tie inscriptionsof the Ch5ja kings Kijaraja I and BSjgfcdra-ChoJa I, on the walls of the BfihadMvara temple at Tanjoie, make mention of sevefal V81aikkaxa regiments. The originof the word vetaikkafa has not yet been conclusively proved. Different scholars have given different interpretationsof the word* Dr, Hultzsch has rendered wlaikkdra-padaigalas* the troop of servants \l The late Bai Bahadur Venkayya was of opinion that it was a corruptionof the wordvelaikkara,, and comments as follows : "At any rate, the originof the term is obscure, and mustbe left to future research* It is possible they were no mercenaries in the Chola country at the beginningof the llth century. If a conjecture may be offered, I would say they were perhaps volunteers who enlisted themselves when the occasion (velai) for their services arose. In later times when their services were not requiredin the Tamil Country, they probably migrated to Ceylon, during the periodof interregnum, when there were frequent Chola invasions against the island. Eventually they probably developed into mercenaries."8 Mr. Krishna Sa&tri, in Ms remarks upon this inscription, saysof the Velaikkajas,"Whatever the Velaikkaras may have been in their religious creed, it is clear from what is stated in the inscription that they included all working classes, and were apparentlyof Indian origin who immigrated into Ceylon with the merchants whom they served."3 The late Mr. Gopinatha Rao's opinion as to who the Velaikkaras were was quite different from any of the views set forth above. He says that they were not mercenaries; but"persons who had pledgedthemselves to do certain duties, failing which, they would voluntarily undergo certain penalties, which, in most cases, was death/' He has quoted twopassages from Tamil literature, one from the commentary of Periyavichchapillai on Nammal var's Tirumoli which, explains the word pu-velaiMdra as"those who, when they see the king being without flower(-garlands) at the time when he ought to wear them, had vowed to stab them selves and die." ,The other extract is from the commentary of the ivavachanabhu$hanam, where the Vejaikkajas are said to be**the servants of the king who chastise those who prove traitorous to ,him."* 
In this inscription they are termed*the Velaikkajas of the three hands'(munru-kai)* In No. 602 of 1912, another inscription from Ceylon, munru*Jcai-tiru~velaikkdran appears as the sur name of a certain AdMkarana Saranan, and in No. 610 of the same year,also from Ceylon, munru Jcai is referred to as the name by which a particular community was known.5 In an inscriptionof the time of Kul6ttunga-Ch5ladeva? in the BhaktavatsaleSvara temple at ShermadevI, munyu-Tcai mahasenai are representedas protecting certain charitable endowments made to that temple.6 ATamil inscription a4 Bangui, in Mysore, too, refers to the Velaikkaras of the right hand/' It seems from our inscription as if the three divisions orc hands'to wMch the Velaikkaras were divided, consisted of the Mabatantra, the Valafijiyar, and the Nagarattar. Out of these terms, Mahatantra is not found elsewhere, and its sense is not clear. Probably it was used here with a Buddhist significance* The terms Valanjiyar and Nagarattar are of frequent use in the South Indian inscriptionsof this period. They are there represented to have been a wealthy and in fluential bodf of merchants. In Mr, Bice's Mysore Inscriptions there are three records from Ralligami, which refer to the corporationof merchants known as the Valanjiyar. In one of them the member^ are styled'*protectors of thd vwa-ba%Mfija rights."8 In the second they are called

banajigas, 1 whilst the third inscriptioncalls the members of the guild"the protectors of the mra ba^anja-dharma"* Two inscriptions from Shikarpur Taluq (Nos. 94 and 118), published in the Epigraphia Carnatica, Vol. VII,3 describe these merchants in great detail. An inscription has been found at JLnatdundava, a village near Polonnaruva, which begins with almost the same phrases as are used in describing the ValaEjIyar merchants in the Kanarese inscriptions from Mysore. This inscription being only a fragment, the word valanjiyar does not actually occur in it; but the phraseology used in it shows, beyond doubt, that it must have been a record of the same Corporation of Merchants.4 In the inscription No. 555 of the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1923, mention is made of thejValanjiyarof South Ceylon (Ten-Ilawgai-valanjiyar). They are there represented as making donations to a Vishnu temple*6 As regards the deriva tion of this word, the late Mr. Venkayya says :"In Kanarese banajiga is still used to denote a class of merchants. In Telugu the word balijaor balijiga has the same meaning. It is therefore probable that the words valanjiyam, valanjiyar, balanji, bananji, banajiga and balija are cognate, and derived from the Sanskrit variij."* The Nagarattars, who are mentioned in this inscription alongwith the Valanjiyars,, were also an influential community of merchants, who, at the time that we are speaking of, had their mercantile establishments not onlyall over South India and Ceylon, but also in Burma and other partsof Further India.7 The Nagarattars comprised within their ranks another class of merchants called the Nanadi&f, An inscription of Queen Lilavati of Ceylon, who reignedin the first decade of the 13th century, mentions the NanadesI merchants as having made some donations to an alms-house at Anuradhapura.8 As the Valanjiyars are said to have been the leaders (mudadai), of the Vejaikkara troops,it might be conjectured that the latter migratedto Ceylon with the Valanjiyar whom they served. The Valanjiyars and the Nagarattarsare at present represented by the Banajiga and Nagaratta communities of the Kanarese country.9 
The different sub-sects, into which the Velaikkaras were further divided, were the Valangai, Idangai, Sirudanam, Pillaigaldanam, Vadugar, Malaiyalar, Parivarakkondam, and others. Out of these Valangai and Idangaimean the 'Right hand' and the 'Left hand' castes respectively. From an early time the inhabitants of South India were thus divided. The Madras EpigrapJiioal Report for 19 13 contains the following interesting account as regardsthe origin of the Jdangai : "While in order to kill demons (that disturbed) the sacrifices of the sage Ka6yapa, we were made to appear from the agni-lku^da (i.e. the sacrificial fire pit), and while we were protecting the said sacrifice., Chakravartin Arindama honoured the officiating sage priests by carrying them in a car, and led them to a Brahinana Colony (newly founded by himself). On this occasion we were made to take our seats on the backside of the car and to carry the slippers and umbrellas of these sages. Eventually, with these Brahmana sages, we also were made to settle down in the villages of Timvellarai, etc. We received the clan name Idangai, because the sages (while they got down their cars) were supported by us ori their left side." In the same inscriptionit is said that there were ninety-eightsub-sects of the Idangai* Their insignia are given thus :"It is also understood that only those, who, duringtheir congregational meetingsto settle communal dis putes, display the insignia^.)of horn, bugle and parasol,shall belongto our class.

to recognise us now and hereafter, in public, must do so from our distinguishing symbols, the feather of the crane and the loose hanging hair."1 
The term Sirudanam appears in the Tanjore Inscriptionsof Rajaraja I and Rajendra-Cholas. I, as a title givento military officers. Among the regiments mentioned in the inscriptionsof the same place we find two named**Birudanattu-va$uga-Ttkavalar and jSirudanattu- Valangai Pelaikkara-ppadaigctt." The true significanceof this term has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Dr. Hultzsch explains the terms &irudanam and perudanam as the* small treasury* and the 'big treasury \ and personsso entitled as officers of the treasury, small or big.. Thetitles are sometimes explained as referring to the followers of the king during his minority and. majority. In all probability Airudanam and perudanam were purely honorary titles conferred on officers, as well as private individuals, according to the status held by them in official position. or in society.2 
The Vadugar (Northerners) might have been immigrants"from the Telugu Country. The* Malaiyalar, most probably, were settlers from the Malabar Coast. On the occasion of the rebellion of the people of Rohai^a against Parakramabahu 1^ as already mentioned, the Keralas took the aide of the insurgents. There are also other references to ihe Keraja soldiers in the Mahavamsa*The term Malaiyalar, therefore, must have been applied to the people foom the Kerala country. 
The inscriptionis silent as to the reason why the protection of the Velaikkaras was sought for the Tooth Relic. If this inscription was engraved only after the death of Vijayabahu I, it must have been owing to the state of anarchy which prevailed after that event. 
Out of the places mentioned in this record, Antiradhapura is the well-known capital of the ancient Sinhalese kings. Arumana has already been identified with Ramannadesa, i.e. Lower Burma. Pulanari, also called Vijayarajapura in the inscription, evidently after JKing". Vijayabahu 1, is the same as Poionnaruwa (Pulastipura3), and was the mediaeval Sinhalese Capital. In Chola inscriptions found in Ceylon this city is also called Jananathamangalam." TJiere are extensive ruins of the many monasteries, palaces and other public buildings with which it was adorned in the days of its splendour.

39.] THE JUFAGADS IHSOEIPTION OF   
No. 39,-THB JUNAGADH INSCRIPTION OF JIVADAMAN (I), 
BY E. D* BAHEBJI, M.A 
The inscription which is edited below for the first time, was discovered by some labour* the top of the dtadfll of Junagadh fort during the rainy season of 1919 Mr 7 Brol the then Chief Engineer of the Junagadh State, removed the stone slab on which it L wriM to the State Office building and, sending its inked impression, informed the Archaeological Survw Department of its discovery. It is now depositefl in the Bahadur 
Khan-ji Museum JunSffadk 
During my visit in the month of October of the same year I read' the inscription from the atom* ^nd took its estampages for publication; 
' 
The record is incised on a heavy slab of stone, the inscribed surface of which measures 31 inches by 10 inches. At present, it consists of two short lines mutilated 'both at the beginai? aad at the end. The first line begins with'the word fakatrapasya and ends with tlie numerical symbol fox 100. The second line begins with a proper name" and ends with the wdrd putra, The length of each of these two lines is 30" and the average height of the letters is S^V Judging, however, from their contents it would appear that originally these lines Wereconsiderably logger! The slab beating the inscription must have been used for building purposes. It was found witi its face turned downwards in the debris of an old structure. When I saw it in the State OjQ|ce at 
Junagadh, the letters were full of plaster or mortar made of powdered bricks (soorkhi) and lime* Possibly9 there were several other lines below, the second one which were mutilated when the stone was broken up to suit the requirements of the mason. 
The characters of the inscription are of the uaual type used in Western India in the second century A,D. and akin to the alphabet in which the Indhau inscriptions of Rudradaman I are written. The lower parts of lea and' ra curve to the left. The three verticals of /aare almost equal in.height and all instances of the subscript form of this letter are tripartite. Fa and the lower partof ma are rather triangular, Both the verticals' of pa we of equal height. In the only extant symbol of the palatal ia the pendant drops from the right 
half of the curve instead of from the left, while the angularity is not quite marked. In the letter aha the cross bar is joinedto the right vertical straightline and not to the left as usual in one case, i.e., in Jcshatrapasya, while in the other, *.&, in varshe, it seems to join both the verticals. 
The inscriptionis written in Sanskrit prose. The object of it, however, is not clear oa account of its mutilated state. The portion giving the date is unfortunately damaged and nothing is legible at the end of the fitst line, except the syinbol for 100. The record refers iteelf to the reign of JivadS.man whose exact rank cannot be now ascertained because the portion of the slab, where his titles were in all probability written, is now missing. That he was a Ijtshatrapa is certain- as that title is prefixed to his name* Two Jlvadamans are known to hrro had any connection with KathiSwar. The first princeof that name was the son,"of Dam&jada^WI and the grandson of Rudradaittan I who is known from his coins to have ruled in KSthiftwSar* from $he year 100 to 118 or 119 of the Sakaera,. The second princeof that name is StSiai J!vad&man> known to us from the coins of his son, Kshatrapa Rudrasii&haJI,',wlH> was ruling in$aka227 and seems to have succeeded to the'throna on the extinction of -the direct Descendants of CKSsH|jana or of the Mahakshatrapa Budrasiiiha ; On patepgra^Mo grounds, I am of opinionthat the inscription under examination pertain* to the ieiga*f -tie Mahakshattapa J^iradSmau L The' second line of this record, contains four prpef names : [Va]stradatta, VSstunaifidika,, VastuiSarmmaka and BSmaka, Tie last word of

the second line, if read as putra [9&m] would show that the first three persons were the sons of Kamaka. The inscription must have been incised to commemorate some pious act or the erection of some building by these three brothers.

HO. 40. PEBUNEYIL RECORD OF KULASEKHARA-KOYILADHIEARL BY A, S, RAMANATHA/AYYATt, B.A,5 HABEAS 
This inscriptionIs engraved on a slab set up in the western prdMra of the Vishrin temple at PertraayH, a suburb of GhanganacJaeri which is a taluk-centre in the Kottayam Division of the Travancore State. It is in clear-cut and well-preserved Vattejuttu characters, which can, -from purely palseographical considerations, be assignedto the llth century A.D. or thereabouts. The language of the record is Tamil, sprinkled with a few dialectical peculiarities of the West 
Coast e.g. 9 irunn-aruli (1 15), aruliydr (1. 23), olla (L 41), vannu (I 58), and a$ilckumad**Qlifin5m 
(U. 61-63). 
The record which is dated in the 8th: year opposite the 2nd year of the reign of a certain king named Kulaseldbiara-Koyiladliikarigal, presumably of the Ghera dynasty, does not give the exact Kollam year but mentions simply the vague astronomical detail that Jupiter was ia Karkataka. But this defect, as will be proved below, is mended by two other inscriptions secured from Quilon2 and Tiruvalur*, both of which are also in the Travancprfe State. The date portions in these two -inscriptions run thus :

Of these, the latter is dated in the year opposite the 2nd year of the reignof pPeruma} when Jupiterstood in Makara, and the first-epigraph, which is dated on the 9th of ChiAgam m th^ Kollam year 278 (=August 1102 A,D.) when Jupiter stood in to "have been issued in the reignof Iramar-Tiruvadi K6yikdhikarigal=%%< ravartigaj in the second year oppositeto the year padi ,the second partof of the possible readingnora. Jupiter, which was in Makara in the 2nd-f Ifit year'0f lit reign of Kula&ekhara-pPerumal accordingto the Tiruvalur record, would have on to Karkataka six years later. This was actually the planet's positionin the 2nd4*&th ft KulaSekhara-Koyiladhikarigalas recorded in the Peruneyil inscription. the kings Kula&ekhara-pPerumal and Kulafiekhara-Kojdkdhikarigal mentioned in epigraphs appearto be identical. Again,it is clear that two years later, ic., in the year, Jupiter would be occupyingthe Kanya-ra&. In the regnal yearof Chakravartigal which has been read as 2nd+llth in the Quilon actually in Kawi (Kanya).This proves beyond doubt that the three to in the epigraphs from Tiruvalur, Quilon and Peruneyil are Identical, and it also ;tht king Kulafiekhara may have ascended the Chera throne between the_ 
Karkataka of the Kollam year 265, i.e., between January and July1090 AJX The title Koyiladhikari assumed by the kingdeserves some notion 
*a temple'or'a palace' and adkikdri is accontroUer.' It is, possible that the ft* palace was left in the hands of an important officer, sometimes the young crown-prince who was consequentlycalled the Koyiladhikari, and so Dr. Gundert has

of the other title Koyiladhikari which would indicate a subordinate position to Ramar-Tiruva$iy appears to be inconsistent. Ramar-Tiruvadi to whom Kula6ekhara was the Koyiladhikari (or Agent-in-chief) may be taken to refer to god RameSvara of the Quilon temple,* Tiruvadi'being a respectful term appliedalike to gods, kings, queens and saints*1 Or again,- Ramar-Tiruva<Ji Koyiladhikarigal may be taken as the proper name of the king and Kula&ekhara as his xegal title. If, however, Ramar-Tiruva^i represents a senior king whose Koyiladhikari was Kula&ekhara at that time, then we have to understand that though the latter has styled himself as an independent kingin the more northern localities in the 4th and 9th years of his reign, he acknowledged a suzerain in Ramar-Tiruva<Ji in the somewhat* later Quilon epigraph. Future researches alone can decide this point one way or the other;but it looks probable*that Kula* fiekhara of the three records was a Chera or Cochin king and that Quilon was his southern outpost where in the palacecalled Panaingavu3 he had encamped on the 9th Chingam of Kollam 27Q* It may be noted that the Cochin rajas even now style themselves as Koyiladhikarigalin docu ments pertainingto the landed propertyof temples, their full title being*Peruzaba^appu Qai gadhara Yira-KSrala Tirukkoyiladhikariga]'.* 
The king of this record oeing assignedto the end of the Hth century AJX, he must be different from KulaSekhara, the author of the Mvkundamala (a devotional poem considered to be the work of the Vaish^ava royal-saint Kula6ekhara-Alvar), and the patron of the author of the four yamaka- kavyas*entitled the Yudkishthiravijaya, the Tripuradahana, the auriJca~ th5daya and the Nalodaya, and from another Kula6ekhara, the royal author of the two Sanskrit dramas, the Tapatuamvaraw* and the Svbhadradhanafijaya, and of the undiscovered prose works the ASckaryamafijan6. 
The object of toe record was to state that the king who was seated in (the hall called) Ne<Ji yata]i ($ his capital t) in company mth the pjrsidents of the four assemblies and (the president .of } Tirukkunjappolai, issued, after due consultation with his ministers, an order granting 
the annual income of 40 Mam of paddy and the tax (?) called arandai from the village of Peruneydal for the expensesof feeding certain Brahmaiis and for expounding the Mahabharata in that temple. The recipientsof the gift were tie ur (i.e. the members of the village assembly) and the poduval (i.e. officers supervising charitable endowments). This order was conveyed by RimaB-TSyan of Kamakka^appalli and NSraya^an^Narayaria^ of Ka4ambana<Ju to the Jwdipati (headmen or chieftains) -of the two villagesof Kapalimafigalam and Muttflju, who thereupon met in the temple of Peruneydal and, agreeing to refrain from collecting the arandai in obedience to the royal mandate, had this stipulation engraved on a slab of stone and got it 0et up in the temple compound. 
The record is important in that it gives us, though perhaps imperfectly, a glimpse into the official routine of the 12th century kKe^a where, more than in any other place^ temple adminis tration was entirely in the hands of ySgams* (corporations),, which were wielding in dependent power in matters pertainingto temple politics, and which were presided over by the long.

Neciiyataii accordiiigto the Keraldtpatti was one of the four assembly halls in tlie capital town, where the councils (ydgams) elected their kings (raJcsha-purushas)tinder the leadershipof their presidents called the Taliyadirimar or Taliyalvaiis1. It is not apparent why the royal writ relating to the Peruneyil temple emanated from the Necjiyatali Assembly Hall instead of from   
the Merra]i representing Mulikkalam, which might be expectedto have exercised its jurisdic* tion over Peruneydal, as it had done in the case of the Tmivaijva^diir and Tirukkakkarai temples. 
Pati or hitjtip&ti is the term which has been appliedto chieftains in the Kottayam plates8 of Sthaiiu-Bavi Punnaittalai*ppati .and Pulaikkudi-ppati, wiio were pettychieftains con trolling restricted areas. Deiavalis or officers in chargeof dS&as or villages would be their equals in status. Arandai3 which literally meanscmisery ', here appearsto signify some kind of tax in money or in kind leviable by the villageofficers on behalf of the king. 
Of the places named in the record* Ea<Jamban4u4 'and Ilandurutti are the localities from where the taliyadiris or presidentsof the Necjiyataji assembly are said to have been selected. Kapalimangalam and Kamakkanappalji are mentioned in the Tiruvalla plates5 and Muttiiju* may be the same as the modern Muttupi in the Tiruvalla taluk. Tirukku&jappula seems to be identical with the village of the same name near Karttigaippai|i (Quilon DEI.) and belonging to the E4appa]U chief.7 
Neciiyataii and Mejjaii8occurringin several other records at Tirukkakkara! may, in all' probability, refer to these two assemblies in addition to being .specific villages answering to these names. 
1 Tali means*a temple'but here refera to the meeting halls (within temples ?) where certain assemblies Compare v. 69 of the SuJcasande/a of Lakshmldilsa (circa 12th cent. A.D*) where the Chra capital Mahodayapura, has been described as having talis, presided over by all-powerful presidents:

No. 41. THE GABAVAPADU GRANT OF GANAPATIDEVA ; &AKA 1182. By C. E. KRISHNAMACHABLU, B.A., OOTACAMUND. 
This grant is engraved on three copper-plates which were forwarded to the Assistant Archaeological Superintendentfor Epigraphy, Southern Circle, Madras, in the year 1916, byM. E. Ry. M. Ramakrishnakavi, M.A., late of the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras, who had obtained them on loan from M. R. Ry. T. Achyuta Rao Pantulu, M.A., DeputyInspector of Schools. No definite information as to their discoveryis available. Their contents have been reviewed in the Madras Epigraphical Reportfor the year 1916- 17.* Theplates have since been acquiredfor the Madras Museum and deposited there. 
The plates are oblongin shape and are held together by a copper ring, the ends of which are rivetted into the back of a circular seal. They measure 91" by 5f*and are about $" in thick ness. . The ring and the seal have a diameter cf 3" and 2" respectively. The ring had not been cut when the plates came upfor examination. They contain four faces of writing in all, the first and the last plates being engraved on their inner sides only. The entire set with, ring and seal weighs 274 tolas. On the seal, on a counter-sunk surface, are engraved in relief (1) the symbols of the Crescent and the Sun at the top ; below these (2) a boar* facing the proper left wi& -a -dagger pkced mits front with the point upwards, and (8) a cow facing the proper left at

This inscription is tlie second copper-plate record, hitherto fotm$, of the Kakatiya dynasty. The one already discovered also belongs to the time of King Grasgiapatl and is published in the Nellore Inscriptions. l It is dated in the Saka year 1176 corresponding to the cyclic year JLnanda and is thus six years earlier than the grant under notice, 
In verses 1 to 6 are praised in order Vighnaraja (i.e., Vinayaka), Varaha, SarasvatI,* the moon-crest of Sambhu, the Lord of Ambika (i.e., Siva), and Vishnu* Verse 7 gives the description of the Lotus coming out of the navel of Vishnu from which was born tBe four faced Brahma (verse 8). Verses 9 and 10 state that from his eye came JLditya (i.e+. Sun) and from him came Mazm who was a king that regulated the castes (varnas) and (their) duties (dharmas) etc. The genealogy from Aditya given in tie record is as follows : 
Aditya. 
i 
Manu. 
KaHkala-Cliola. 
! 
Durjjaya. 
Prola. 
Kudra. Mahideva, 
Ga^apatideva. 
KalikSla-Cliola is stated to have gone to the BaksM^apatlia in the course of a hunting expedition (verse 11). Alighting there upon a famous town called* Kakati* he pitched Ms extensive camp near it (verse 12). King 3>-arjjaya who had the epithet Ra^a-durjayQ? (invin* cible in war) was the next notable member of this family by whom the line of the Kakati Mugs was first established (verse 13). Then is mentioned (verse 14) King Prola i.e., Prola II according to the genealogyof the Motupalli record of Gariapatideva.4 His son was Rtidra (verse 15) who was succeeded by his younger brother Ma&adeva whose elephants made a breach in the ramparts of the residence of the Sevuutia (king)5(verse 16). His son was King Ganapatideva whose

a A Copper-plate grant of about the 7th century A.D. (No, 6 of Appendix A to the Spigra&foeal M^on tot 1916-17) mentions Maharaja Ra^a-durjaya as the founder of the familyto which king Ppthivi-Mahizaja of <& record belonged, He belonged to the Kaiya-pa-go^m.It may be recalled here that KankaJa.Gh.6la *y*d ttw descendants claimed to belong to this gotra and that the long inscription at Malkapnmm refers to the KAfcottyaa 
Burjava-K^hatriyas ( AT^m^caZReport OT 1916-17, page 122, para, 32). 
**JB[p. Ind., VoL XH, page 189. Prof. Hultzsch remarks here that 'the first king of this dynasty, Brdla I is not mentioned in any other Kakatlya inscription/ It may, however, be noted that he is the earlier of tte two *Pr61as' mentioned in No. 107 of the Madras EpisraphicaJColtecfcion for 1902. Fmm No. 204 of 1905 it is seen that Prola H had two other sons, v&., Harihara and Ganapati, not generally known. Of these Oanapafci |McobaHy died at an early age. 
This must be the Devagiri Yadava king BMHama who reigned from A.B. 1187 to 1191 or Jaitogi I who reigned from A.B. 1191 to 1210 (Bom. Oaz.9 Volume I, Part 2, page 519), Mahad^a^ latest jear wrold |>e AJ). 1197 or 1198.2 T S

exploits were great (verse 17). His minister was Devaraja1 wlio was famed for Ms wide charities (verse 18). He had four sons through his wife Lakshmi; they were respectively called Rama, Tikka,3 Maincliaya and Betaya (verse 19). In the Sakayear 1182, correspond ing to the cyclic year Randra, in the month Chaitra, on the day of the Solar eclipse in tke dark fortnigflit,. Tikka, the second of the said four sons, grantedthe villageof Garavapa<Ju as an agrahara, to fifty Brahmans of several gotras* learned in the Vedas (verses 20 and 21), The date, according to the late Dewan Bahadur L. D. Swamikannu Pillai's Ephemeris,corre sponds to Monday (not givenin the inscription) April 12, A.D. 1260. On this day there was a Solar eclipse as stated in the inscription, 
The statement that Karikala-Chola fixed his capital at Kakati in Dakshi^apatha IB not found in any other known record of this dynasty, though Kalikala (or Karikala)-Cholaas an ancestor of the family is mentioned in some. In a few records, however,* Kakati'is referred to as a place with which its early members were connected. An unpublished epigraph4 refers to Kakati as the*family city*(kulapura)of this dynasty. Another such epigraph5 refers itself to kingfiGaijapatideva of Kakatiyyapura.' 
A chief named Kakartya Ghujdyana is mentioned in an unpublished copper-plate grant* belonging to about A,D. 945 as a subordinate of the Eastern Chalukya king Amma II 7 The family to which the chief belonged is called Samantavoddi The epithetcKakartya % which is evidently a variant of'Kakatya, must, therefore, refer to a place to which the chief belonged. It is thus almost certain thate Kakati*was an ancient place and the family name Kakati, ELakatya, Kaketa or Kakatiya was based upon the origiriSl connection of its members with a town of that name and not upon the worshipof any family deityas suggested by Kumarasvamin8 [Burnell quoted by Fleet. Ed.]the learned commentator of the PratSparudriya.. If the latter 
1 Devaraja was not the only minister of the Jongfor we are told that a certain Sivadevayya was Ms Chief Minister (Lives of Tdugu Poets by Viresalingam, Old Edition, page 36) who was looked upon as no less than a god. Sivadevayya must have been identical with the great Saiva teacher Vifive^vara-Siva-Desika, the pontiff of the Gajajd maika and the raja-guruof three Mags among whom was King Ga^apati (JSpigraphical Report for 1917, page 123)* 
'The commander Tikka feas to be distinguished from his two oontempo^xiesof this name mz.9 (i) the great poet Tikfcana who wrote the latter fifteen parvas of the Telugu MaMbJi arcda and who is stated to have gone as an ambassador to the Court of Ga^apati from long Mantanasiddhi of Nellilra (Nellore) whose minister he was and (ii) the warrior Tikka, the cousin of the poet, who was the commander of the armies of Mamimasiddhi. Siddha, the father of the last was n^iiuster under king Tikka, the father of Mantunadddhi (Ztra.o/ Tdu&t Poets, pages 33 to 39). The name Tikka, it may l>e noted, is a contracted form of 'Tiruk-KaJatti* a Prakrit form ofc Sn-Kalahajstf.' The name was taken after that of tlie popular god Sri-KaJahastfsvara at Kalahasti, Chittoor District, Madras Presidency, See Nellwe /w*cftjp fion*, A- 7, G, 45, Q, 60, etc. 
8 Though verse 20 of the inscriptionstates that the village was grantedto'fifty' Brahmanis, actually only forty niae Brahmans received shares. The fiftieth share was grantedto Vallabha of S:rlkakolanu viz., Srikakujam in the Dhri taluk of the Kistna district. This is the god of the place who IB known also by the name*Srikaku}esvara* and has beea popular from early times (see Madras EpigraphicalCollection lor 3893, Nos. 136-172). While making grant* of agraharas it was customary for ancient kings to provide shares for the local deities and for the Vedasv chiefly JJik and Yau'us (ribove, Vol. XVI, p. 253, text line 273 and p. 263). The first eleven recipients of shares arc of the 
YflBka-^m which is very rarely met with in these days. Yaska, the- author of the Nintfrta, was of this gdlra* His patronymic is Paingim the Anukramayii of the ItreyWafcM (Weber Indiscfo Sfadien, I 71, n; 3396; Vedic Index by Maodonell and Keith, VoLII, page 23). The^MuniYaska is mentioned in the Ah^yma-SrautQwirG (Utiat&rdfM) along with Vadhiila, Manna, Mauka, ^rkarakfihi, Saishti, Savarni, Salafikayana, Jaimri Daivantyayana, most of whom were founders of gdtm

were tlie case (Jho deity would have been invoked or praised at least in a few of the innumerable records of tins family. And even if there was such a deity known or familiar to the commentator it must have been called so after the placefi Kakati.'1 There are many instances of the presicU ing goddess Durga of a village beingcalled after the village.2 
Kanker, the head- quartersof the state of that name, situated immediately to the north of the Bastar State in the Central Provinces was formerly called Kakera, Kakaira and Kakaraya.s Since epigraphs refer to Kakati as a yura (i.e., city) as noticed above, it is very likely that Kanker, as suggested by its ancient names, was identical with KakatL The forms* Kakati* *Kakatya/ etc. might have, in local pronunciation, taken the forms Kakera (<?/. the form Kaketa). The connection of the Kakati kings with Kalikala-Chola, wlio is well-known to South Indian history as a king of about the 6th century A,D., and the story that he fixed lis capital at the town of Kakati and the appearance, in the adjoining state of Bastar, of an early (Jaka 983) Ch$la Chief Chamdraditya-Maharaja4 who calls himself, like the Kakatlyas, a descendant of Karikala Chola, point to the possibilityof the said identity. The advent, again, of Annamaraja, the brother of Kakti (i.e. Kakati) Prataparudra into Bastar, the present ruling familyof which is Kakatlya though curiously enough SomavamSi must have been only a return to the inherited family territory lying here or such territory reconquered and recovered now.5 
Among the boundaries of the gift village no village or town is mentioned to help us in its identification. There are villagesof the name *Garapadu*in the Guntnr and the SatteuapalJe taluks of the Guntur district and in the Nuzvid taluk of the Kistna district. From the reported fact of the discoveryof the plates near Ellore in the latter district it may have to be identified with the villageof Garapadu in the Nuzvid taluk.6

From the navel of this (Vishnu) who desired to create the world there appeared a lotus* which did not depend upon the Sun for its awakening (i.e., blossoming) and which did not depend upon the splendoursof tjhe moon-light for its sleep (i.e., closure). 
(V. 8). From that lotus arose the Self-torn (Brahma) simultaneously determining the four quarters with -the four faces beatitiful -like itself (i.e., the lotus) and even so (i.e., simultane ously) revealing the four Vedas with thejr branches (anffas).
