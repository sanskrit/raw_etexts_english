Americans are particularly interested in knowing about a person’s race,
just as we might be curious about a person’s varNa or jAti. In any
paper-work, be it of small or big importance, the American officialdom
demands to known your race. Indians living in the mlechCha-desha often
have a profound difficulty with this matter because despite comprising a
1/6 th of humanity they do not have a race to describe them. The common
categories imposed by the Americans are white, black, Native American,
Asian, and “Pacific Islanders”. Of these the first 4 can be called valid
races, whereas the 5th is too vague and would qualify as a race if they
had monophyletic Melanasians and Papuans and their closest sister groups
as the only valid members of that category. It is often frustrating that
an Indian just does not have a choice. Today a paper was published by
Rosenberg et al in the free wannabe tabloid studying the Indian
populations using a sample of Indians living in the US. The conclusions
are not unexpected but worth reiterating nevertheless:  
1\) Indians are a distinct population. When you do K-means type
clustering with K=7 using a panel of autosomal genetic variation at 729
microsatellite and 471 insertion/deletion polymorphisms we see the
following populations of the world fall out as clusters:  
1\) “Blacks/Africans”: Bantus, Bushmen, Pygmies included  
2\) Whites: Europeans and Middle Easterners included.  
3\) Indians: from Kashmir to Tamil Nad, Gujarat to Bengal all major
varNa populations included.  
4\) Mongoloids (Asians): Chinese Han, Japanese, Mongols, Koreans,
Indo-Chinese and Yakuts included.  
5\) Papuans and Melanasians.  
6\) Native Americans from North and South America.  
7\) The Kalash.  
Baring the Kalash, who are a uniquely isolated population, the remaining
categories are pretty reasonable racial categories which correspond to
what American have on their forms. So the point is clear we need a race
for ourselves.

Of course TSPians, Nepalese, Lankans and Afghans might vehemently object
to this race being called Indian because it might shake their very
claims to distinctness. But it is better they accept the truth staring
on them that they are just fragments of the whole and move on with it.
Many TSPians, like Sindhis, Baloch and Pathans are bit of neither here
nor there, with some Western admixture.

Another result strengthened from this study is that Indians are
definitely closer to Europeans and Middle Easterners than to Mongoloids.
Thus, all those Indians being forced to describe themselves as Asians on
American forms are being made to mis-report their genetic affinities by
wrongly grouping them with a more divergent group. On the whole this
supports the well known idea of a Caucasian higher-order cluster which
is divided into two main branches: Western Caucasoids a.k.a Whites and
Eastern Caucasoids, who should be called Indians.

However, the most important find is that Indians from the length and
breadth of India are closer to each other than Europeans or Mongoloids
are amongst themselves. There, is very little correlation between
geography and allele distribution in Indian varNa population, because of
they pretty closely related to each other throughout the country. This
means we have every reason to remain one country, united by our genes
and original dharma. If anything, the only thing that can fragment
Indians is not their genetic divergence but Abrahamistic memetic
infections like Islam and Christianity.

The picture emerging from Rosenberg et al’s work.

Note that there are some populations that are genuinely weird. The
Hazaras represent a Mongol population that came with Chingiz Kha’Khans
conquering army and got isolated in Afghanistan to this date. Now they
have lost their power and status and are being mercilessly hunted by the
Pathans there. That apart, both around 700 years of isolation from the
larger Mongol population and admixture with local groups has resulted in
them occupying a position sort of in the “middle of nowhere”. A similar
position is seen is seen for the Uighur Turks- they are overall slightly
closer to Caucasoids than Mongoloids. But end up largely in the “Middle
of Nowhere” due pull from both sides. This shows that they are a product
of the ancient Caucasoid substratum (Tocharian speakers?) being subsumed
under the Turko-Mongol expansion. In this context it is interesting to
note the politically incorrect point that the Uighurs showed the highest
cultural development and complexity amongst the early Turkic expansions.

The Kalash are group of Indo-Iranians, most probably occupying a
intermediate position between the Indo-Aryans and Iranians who got
isolated for perhaps several millenniums in the highlands of
Afghanistan. The Burusho is another isolated Afghan population like the
Kalash but speak an isolate language. These two groups generally group
with the Caucasoids, but their isolation has diverged them from any
specific group of Caucasoids and they just hang close to the base. The
Parsis are a relatively recent immigrant group showing a similar
phenomenon. But their grouping with Indians with at least 75% bootstrap
support suggest that even they have mixed with local Indian populations
after arriving. The “Western Indians” or groups from modern TSP exhibit
the typical properties of boundary-zone populations- that is admixture
with the adjacent group. In this case it is the Western Caucasoids or
the “Whites”. Thus they lie apart as a group away from core Indians.
