On the shuklapakSha prathamI of the month of phAlguna in the year
nandana, 5113 of the kaliyuga, a shvetaketu-putra was sighted by us .625
muhUrta-s after sunset. The shikhin was in the quarter of awful nirR^iti
to the south of both the sun and moon and due to its low altitude needed
a binoculars to sight it. Both the moon and the comet where in our
nakShatra. Yet it was pretty bright and and its magnitude by comparison
with the sliver of the prathamI moon could be placed as around .25 or
so. Thus, we would place it among our memorable shikhin-s: Hale-Bopp,
Hayakutake and Halley, which was the first ever we saw in our lives. The
moon was a like the sword of rudra with comet above its southern horn
with a prominent tail and bright nucleus.
