Indra, is the Indo-Aryan version of the preeminent deity of the
ancestral Indo-European pantheon. In the Vedic texts we see remnants of
what might have been an ancient tripartation of this deity, as manifest
on the earth, in the atmosphere and in the heavens. In the first realm
he is manifest a warrior who inspires men in battle and comes to the aid
of his ārya worshipers who offer him rituals – in this form he is
typically called Indra or Maghavan or Vṛtrahan. In his atmospheric form
he is Parjanya, who abundantly pours down life-giving rain. In his
celestial manifestation in the high heavens he is Dyaus. Already in the
Ṛgveda, the earliest surviving Indo-Aryan text, under the name Indra
he comprehensively encompasses all three functions. Yet, the old memory
of tripartation is still seen as both Parjanya and Dyaus are retained as
distinct devatā-s with specific functions in the atmospheric and
celestial domains. By the time of the Mahābhārata, Parjanya has already
mostly merged into Indra and lost his distinctness and Dyaus is only
faintly remembered within the ogdoad of Vasu-s \[incarnated on earth as
the pitāmaha Bhīṣma\]. In the rest of the Indo-European world we see a
similar consolidation of the ancestral tripartation into a single
figure, but in each case a different strand of original triad is chosen
for consolidation. In the Greek and Roman world we have the cognate
deities Zeus and Iuppiter (Ius+piter being father), where both are
cognates of Dyaus. In the Baltic and Slavic world we have Perkunas and
Perun, both of which are cognates of Parjanya. In Lithuania, the name of
the place featuring the great shrine of Perkunas with a holy oak tree
from pre-Christian times was Perkūnija – a cognate of Parjanya. However,
in Lithuania the cognate of Indra continued to survive as Indraja, the
name of the deity of the planet Jupiter. In the Indosphere and among the
Kalasha we see the consolidation under Indra.

While Indra is the preeminent deity of the ancient Vedic rituals, in the
later period his prominence was challenged by sects centered on other
deities like Prajāpati (Brahmā), Bṛhaspati, Rudra, Viṣṇu and Kumāra.
This challenge becomes visible first in the latter Vedic texts,
especially the brāhmaṇa-s (including their terminal upaniṣad-s) and
becomes rather ubiquitous in the epics and the purāṇa-s. Such challenges
to the preeminence of the Indra-like deity are also seen in other
branches of the Indo-European world: In the Iranosphere Ahura Mazda, a
cognate of the Indian Varuṇa, takes over as the supreme deity. In the
Germanic world Odin, belonging to the Rudra-class of deities takes over
while also subsuming few elements of Varuṇa in his persona. While the
Veda-s abound in mantra-s to Indra, they are allusive in nature. Hence,
unlike the deities who became prominent later, some of legendary
materials, similar to those encountered in the purāṇa-s for deities like
Rudra, Viṣṇu and Kumāra, have been forgotten. Yet, the Rāmāyaṇa and
Mahābhārata still retain some memory of the system in which Indra is
preeminent and consequently preserve some such legendary material of
interest. Indeed, such material seems to have been known to the
aitihāsika-s, as suggested by the specific reference to them by
Skandasvāmin, the old commentator of the Ṛgveda. One such is the
description of Indra’s realm to Yudhiṣṭhira and his brothers by the sage
Nārada. On account of it being one of those pieces from the great epic
plainly retaining the ancient preeminence of Indra we present it below
in full (Mbh 2.7.1-26ab):

śakrasya tu sabhā divyā bhāsvarā karmabhir jitā |  
svayaṃ śakreṇa kauravya nirmita+arka-samaprabhā ||

Indeed, the divine and radiant assembly hall of Śakra was achieved by
his own deeds. O Kauravya, with splendor like that of the sun, it was
built by Śakra himself.

rituals and acts of valor. Bṛhaspati and Śukra had gone there together\!

O king, many other self-restrained souls, firmly observant of ritual
vows, Bhṛgu and the seven sages \[go forth\] upon recitation of mantra-s
\[to Indra\] by means of their moon-shaped flying machines, which are
beautiful as moons. O King, this assembly hall of Indra, the
Puṣkaramālinī was \[thus\] seen by me (i.e. Nārada).

Notes  
1\) The motif of an assembly hall of the great Indra-like deity is
likely an ancestral Indo-European one. We encounter it in the Germanic
world in the form Valhalla of Odin or Bilskirnir of Thor; both are
described as celestial halls of enormous size. The meaning of the latter
is lightning-streak, which relates it directly to the hall of Indra.
Just as Indra’s hall endowed with several chambers (veśman), the
Bilskirnir is said to have 540 rooms (a number related to the precession
of earth’s axis), where he is said to hold court with his wife the
goddess Sif (parallel to Indrāṇī). Just like Indra’s realm, Odin vast
hall the Valhalla is said to welcome extraordinary individuals (not the
common dead) who proceed there due their valor in battle. Indeed
memorial stones depicting the ascent of fallen heroes to Valhalla of the
Indra-realm, with beckoning Valkyries or Aparas-es are seen respectively
in the Nordic and Indic world. The Valhalla, like Indra’s hall, is said
have divine trees (Glasir and Læraðr are named in particular) and is
said to be shining and golden comparable to the above account. In the
Greek world too Zeus is said to have an assembly hall in the heavens
where all the gods meet with Zeus at the head, much like what is
described in the case of Indra’s hall (e.g. Illiad 20.5).

2\) The Indra-sabhā is not just seen as a hall but is conceived more
like a cuboidal space station which can freely move about in space. It
also receives traffic of arriving and departing space-crafts which are
said to bear the visiting sages. Thus, it is conception is a truly
celestial and “futuristic” one relative to the Greek and Germanic
versions which seem more static. This illustrates a less-appreciated
point: space travel has long existed in human thought, well before the
first operational space-crafts were sent up. Thus, it is the continuity
with epic visions such as these, which might be seen as the archetypal
inspiration for human flight and space voyages.

3\) Marut-s figure prominently among the gods mentioned in this account.
While the Marut-s had faded in prominence by the time core Mahābharata,
this account clearly preserves the older Vedic system with the troops of
Marut-s as the primary companions of Indra, especially in his battles
with the demons. Importantly, this account uses the term gṛhamedhin,
i.e. Marut-s as the recipients of the offerings in the gṛhamedha which
is part of the larger sākamedha rite, the autumnal ritual in the yearly
cāturmāsya cycle. Most other Vedic deities are listed with the exception
of Yama, Varuṇa, Prajāpati, Viṣṇu, and perhaps Rudra. These were perhaps
consciously omitted by the composer or the redactor of the text because:
1) the first three of these are described as having their own celestial
realms that are described later. 2) Viṣṇu, and Rudra were probably left
out because with their rise in the late Vedic and Epic period their
votaries did not want to see them as being secondary to Indra. However,
it is uncertain if Sthāṇu in the above list stands for Rudra or someone
else. Whatever the case, the above narrative is emphatic in placing
Indra as the supreme deity using terminology parallel to the Rathantara
Sāman of the Vedic ritual: “īśānaṃ sarvalokasya vajriṇaṃ samupāsate”.

4\) The goddess Indrāṇī is identified with Śrī and Lakṣmī following an
ancient pattern. Indra is also said to be accompanied by other goddesses
such as the personified modesty, fame, and majesty, and Śraddhā, Medhā
and Sarasvatī, who are like the Muses in Zeus court. There are also
Gandharva-s and Apsara-s who provide music, dance and comedy in the
court. This music in the sabhā seems to have been an ancient feature for
it is paralleled by comparable music in the court of Zeus in the
Olympian realm. For example we have Pindar describe it thus:  
*Golden lyre, possession and advocate of Apollo*  
*and the Muses with their violet hair,*  
*the dance step which begins the festivity hear you,*  
*and singers obey your signals*  
*when you quiver and fashion the preludes*  
*of the proems that begin the dance.*  
*You quench even the pointed lightning \[of Zeus\]*  
*with its ever-flowing fire. On his scepter*  
*the eagle of Zeus sleeps*. \[Translation by K. A. Morgan\]

5\) A long list of sages and sage-kings, although anachronistic,
stretching from the ancient Vedic patriarchs to the authors of the
Rāmāyaṇa are all provided as a list. This is to illustrate the point
that extraordinary individuals upon death attain the Indra realm, where
they engage in his direct worship as they had done formerly in their
earthly fire and soma rituals. This is further emphasized by pointing
out that the normally antipodal Bṛhaspati and Śukra are seen together
worshiping Indra in line with their Vedic persona, where both sages are
composers of mantra-s to Indra.

6\) Several terms specifically refer to the Vedic rituals where Indra
reigns supreme. Some of these represent celestial entities and
phenomena: The 27 fires represent the 27 Nakṣatra-s of the Vedic
ecliptic: the deities corresponding to these receive offerings in the
ritual known as the Nakṣatreṣṭi. Then there are the graha-s, which
represent both the cups in which soma is offered to the gods and the
planets. Specifically the pair of cups used in the great soma ritual are
mentioned: Śukra and Manthin. These two cups commemorate a cunning trick
by which the Deva-s overthrew Śanda and Marka, two partisans of the
Asura-s and Rakṣa-s, who tried to steal the Soma. Also mentioned are the
stobha-s, which are magical vocalizations of the Sāman chants (au ho vā,
iḍā etc).
