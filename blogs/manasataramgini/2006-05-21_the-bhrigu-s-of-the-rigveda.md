title = "The bhR^igu-s of thexa0R^igveda"

+++
From the accounts of vedic tradition the bhR^igu-s were the foremost of
the R^iShi-s. It appears that they were the founders of the fire ritual
which is at the heart of the vedic religion. They are not authors of
many mantra-s of the R^ig veda, though their surrogate clan, the
shaunahotra-s, have a maNDala to themselves (RV2). Nevertheless, bhR^igu
or the bhR^igu-s are mentioned 27 times by name in the RV. A single
ancient member of the main-line bhR^igu clan ushanA kAvya, the grandson
bhR^igu, through his son kavi bhArgava, is mentioned by that name in 15
times in the RV. Another much latter main-line bhR^igu, jamadagni, is
mentioned as contemporary by two of the great RV R^iShis, vishvAmitra
(who was an ally jamadgni) and vasiShTha. He is mentioned 9 times in the
RV. Other bhR^igus are fleetingly mentioned by name, like apnavAna (at
least 2 times) and aurva, and, like ushanA kAvya are clearly historical
figures even for most of the RV composers.

bhR^igu/s are mentioned by name by most major clans of the RV from all
three dvija varNas:  
13 times by the other ancient brahminical clan the A\~Ngirasa from whom
most mainstream brahmins descended. 3 times by vasiShTha-s. 3 times by
vishvAmitra-s. 2 times by kShatriya hymn composers. 2 times the by
ancient vaishya sages vatsapri and bhAlandana. 1 time by atri-s. 1 time
by the shaunahotra-s 1 time by the later bhR^igu-s. bhR^igu may also be
refered to by his generic name atharvan. The name atharvan in used 14
times in the RV. Seven (7) of these occurences are directly used in the
sense of bhR^igu/s in connection to their ancient kindling of fire or
ancient sacrifice. 4 occurences are in the sense of a contemporary
atharvan priest performing a rite.

Many important themes emerge by examining the hymns mentioning bhR^igu-s
in the RV:  
1\) A persistant motif which appears to be common knowledge amongst the
vedic composers is that of mAtarishvAn (vAyu) bearing agni to
bhR^igu-s.  
2\) agni is often discovered by the bhR^igu-s hidden cave or is brought
to them from a hidden cave by mAtarishvAn.  
3\) The bhR^igu-s are associated with the kindling of fire and the two
births of agni, one of which appears to be within water. The fire within
water is also a major theme with other bhR^igu sages like aurva. Several
bhR^igu-s have fiery names: bhR^igu= cognate of fiery, phleugai etc;
aurva- the fire in water; jamadagni- the feeder of fire.  
4\) The bhR^igu-s make a car for the gods.

The observation that most clans mention bhR^igu-s as the promulgator of
the fire rite, suggests that they were ancient predecessors of the vedic
rite. This is well-supported by the subheShaja hymn and the sAmidhenI
rite. However, this role might have even been performed by the later
bhR^igu-s as the term ‘gR^iNAna’ (gR^iNAti=teach) is used 5 times with
jamadagni bhArgava, suggesting he proclaimed the fire rite to many even
in his period.
