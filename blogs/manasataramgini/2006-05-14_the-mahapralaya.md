The Hindu kingdom of Mataram in Yavadvipa, associated with the famous
tantra of the vajramaNDala, came to an end in 1006. It was take to its
peak by the rAjan named: makuTa-vamsha-vardhana ishAna kula-sUrya. Due
to the recent revival of the volcano that ended Mataram, I was reminded
of this and also the need to look more deeply into this tantra (some of
whose mantras were recovered on golden plates inscribed in a ruined
Indonesian temple) when the chance arises . The inscription on the
Calcutta stone states that in 928 shaka (1006 CE) there was a tremendous
mahApralaya and a strike of fire which ended the kingdom of Mataram. The
whole of the yavadvIpa is said to have become a kShira sAgara. It was
described as corresponding to the end of the kalpa described in the
Hindu texts. The kShira sAgara is most likely to be a description of the
[tephra (volcanic
ash)](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/tephra.html) that was
spewed all over by the volcanic eruption of Merapi. In a recent
conversation with the two JSs I learnt that a tephral layer has been
recovered in Indonesia with the charcoal from it C14 dated to between
900-1100 CE. This must definitely mark the kShira-sAgara created by
mahApralaya of Merapi in 1006 CE that ended the Hindu kingdom of Central
Java.
