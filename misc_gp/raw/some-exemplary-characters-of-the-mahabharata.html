<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—The Embodiment of Knowledge</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the modern times many unfounded presumptions are made regarding Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Some people hold that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was not a historical personage. Some say that there had been a man named Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa a few thousand years ago but he was only an extraordinary human being. But the aspect of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as we find in Bhagavadg¶tŒ is the aspect of true knowledge. Such personage had never been in this world. Some opine that several personages known as K¾¦Äa have been there. K¾¦Äa of BhŒgavata was different from that of MahŒbhŒrata. Not only this, some say even to the extent that K¾¦Äa of V¾ndŒvana was someone else, the other K¾¦Äa was of MathurŒ and the third K¾¦Äa was of DwŒrakŒ. In this article an attempt will be made on the authority of MahŒbhŒrata to show that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa of the MahŒbhŒrata and that of BhŒgavata were the same—the integral whole and the Supreme Being. The aspect that has been described in the G¶tŒ is His real aspect and the allusions made at different places in the MahŒbhŒrata go to prove this fact.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Like <span class="char-style-override-5">BhŒgavata</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> also upholds the fact that the controller of the world, the god of gods and the master of the entire universe Lord NŒrŒyaÄa had descended upon the earth as Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa (<span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata,  di Parva,</span> chapter 64). In the <span class="char-style-override-5">RŒjasµuya YajÛa</span> performed by <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> Yudhi¦¢hira, the celestial sage NŒrada along with other great <span class="char-style-override-5">Mahar¦is</span> arrived there to see the grand YajÛa. Finding Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa  present in the canopied hall along with other kings, he is reminded of the fact that Lord NŒrŒyaÄa had manifested himself upon the earth (<span class="char-style-override-5">SabhŒ Parva</span> 36.12) and mentally dwells upon lotus eyed Ýr¶ Hari. Later on when the question cropped up in the assembly as to who amongst the honourable guests should be adored first, the high souled Bh¶¦ma, the eldest among the members of the Kuru race and bravest of the brave, declared that he considered Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa the Supreme to be adored first and began to speak highly of His glory in the crowded assembly. He begins thus—VŒsudeva himself is the cause of creation and dissolution of the world of created beings consisting of animate and inanimate objects. VŒsudeva alone is the unmanifest nature, the invariable creator and the Lord of the entire created beings and hence He is supremely worthy of adoration.” The celestial sage NŒrada also supports the proposal (<span class="char-style-override-5">SabhŒ Parva</span> 39.8). Further, the gods shower flowers from the sky on Sahadeva who seconded the proposal and the voice without form echoed the words ‘Well said!’ ‘Well said!’ in praise of him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We do not find a direct description of childhood activities of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>. The reason is that such activities have no bearing to the main episode of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>. Of course in the <span class="char-style-override-5">HarivaÅÜa Parva</span> which is an epilogue to the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> this deficiency has been made good. Nevertheless we find here and there in the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> itself reference to such activities of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa made by its various characters. Opposing the aforesaid proposal of grandfather Bh¶¦ma, ÝiÜupŒla, the king of Chedi, who was an antagonist of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa since his birth and who had become all the more envious of him  since after the abduction of RukmiÄ¶, mentions the events of His childhood—the event of the killing of PµutanŒ, BakŒsura, Kes¶, V¾¦Œsura and KaÅsa, the overturning of the cart and the lifting up of the Gobardhana mountain etc. (<span class="char-style-override-5">SabhŒ Parva</span> 4. 7—11). Although he refers to these events with a view to censure Him, he admittedly accepts their veracity. The description of the superhuman activities of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa given by an enemy not only reveals the super natural character of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, but also provides ample reason to reconsider their opinion to those who regard the Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> as different from that of the <span class="char-style-override-5">BhŒgavata</span>. Well, in that context ÝiÜupŒla spoke very ill of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as well as Bh¶¦ma PitŒmaha who praised Him. But Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa put up with all his transgressions bravely. But when He found that he would not be pacified despite the persuasions by the courtiers He invoked His discus called SudarÜana (<span class="char-style-override-5">SabhŒ Parva</span> 45. 21) and with that sharp edged discus beheaded him in the presence of all. All the people present in the assembly at that time noticed that a large orb of effulgent light came out of ÝiÜupŒla’s body and having made obeisance to universally adored Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa entered into His Being. This unnatural incident not only bears the proof of the divinity of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa but also gives evident proof of the fact that however great a sinner might be, attains salvation (the merger of the individual soul with the Oversoul) in case he is killed by the divine hands and is forever merged with the aspect of the divine being. This is verily His matchless grace. Even through killing He redeems the embodied beings. So there is nothing uncommon if he plays into the hands of those who love Him like <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Draupad¶ is insulted by Du¬ÜŒsana she feeling altogether helpless raises a cry for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and addresses him by such names as—‘Beloved of the Gop¶s’, ‘The saviour of Vraja and other like names. This further goes to prove that the Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa of V¾ndŒvana and that of MathurŒ were not different personages. So, hearing the pathetic call of Draupad¶ the compassionate KeÜava comes running from DwŒrakŒ and hiding Himself as <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> behind her clothes saves the modesty of Draupad¶ (<span class="char-style-override-5">SabhŒ Parva</span> 67. 45–49). Can a human being rescue his dear one sitting in a far off place in such a miraculous way?’</p>
<p class="Numbers">(3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having lost their all in the game of dice the righteous <span class="char-style-override-5">PaÄÎavas</span> were undergoing the hardships of banishment. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa also arrived at the place. Meanwhile the great ascetic MŒrkaÄÎeya blessed with a long lease of life, came up there of his own accord and during the course of conversation related to them the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Telling them his experiences of the period of dissolution he says—“the wonderous child whom I saw lying on a banyan leaf in the unfathomable depth of water was none else than K¾¦Äa, relative of yours. By virtue of the boon granted by Him my memory remains ever unfailing and I have been blessed with a long life span extending for thousands of years and also death at my will.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once sent by Duryodhana with the intention of causing harm to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> the irascible great sage DurvŒsŒ accompanied by ten thousand disciples guested with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>. Now by the grace of Sun-god Yudhi¦¢hira had obtained such a miraculous pot that the  little foodgrain cooked in it could be sufficient to feed any number of guests to their heart’s content. But this could be done only so long as Draupad¶ would not take her meals. Through Duryodhana’s conspiracyDurvŒsŒ arrived at a time when Draupad¶ had taken her meal after feeding all others. The pious Yudhi¦¢hira who was by nature hospitable to the guests invited the congregation of the sages to dine and they went to the bank of the river GaÆgŒ to bathe and to perform their daily rituals. Unable to find any means to feed thousands of <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span>, Draupad¶ was greatly worried at that critical moment. In her heart she remembered Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, her well-wisher and kinsman and He came running to her without any loss of time. As soon as He came He said that He was terribly hungry and demanded something to eat without delay. Draupad¶ related to Him the whole story. She said she had just finished her meal and there is nothing left in that pot. Turning a deaf ear to what she said He spoke thus “Where is the pot? Please bring it to me. Let me have a look at it.” Draupad¶ brought the pot to him. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa noticed that a vegetable leaf was sticking at the neck of the pot. Putting it into His mouth He said—“Let the Lord, the universal soul and enjoyer of sacrifices be satisfied with this vegetable leaf.” Then He asked Sahadevaj¶ to go and get the host of sages for dinner. Reaching the bank of river GaÆgŒ, Sahadevaj¶ found none of them there. Now it so happened that when the Lord, having put the vegetable leaf into His mouth was pronouncing His resolve, the sages standing in the water were reciting <span class="char-style-override-6">‘अघमर्षण’</span><span class="char-style-override-5">‘Mantra</span> of the mid day<span class="char-style-override-5">SandhyŒ</span>. All of them felt that their bellies had become suddenly loaded with food upto the very throat. Then they were very much frightened to visualize that the food cooked at the house of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> would be a waste and they stealthily fled away from there presupposing that the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> would be angry on that account. He knew what had happened to him at the house of Ambar¶¦a and ever since that incident, had become afraid of the Lord’s devotees. Not finding them there Sahadeva returned. Thus Ýr¶ Hari, well disposed to those taking shelter in Him, saved those who took refuge in Him. Hail to such a love for the devotees. Such episode of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa reveals that he was vested with godhood and was all pervasive.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">SaÛjaya was the minister of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and his favourite too. As an envoy of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> he goes to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> at Upaplavya and after returning from there delivers their message to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra. In that context describing the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa he observes—“If Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa so desires He can reduce the entire world to ashes simply by His resolve but the entire world together cannot reduce Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to ashes.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Where there is truth there is righteousness; where there is modesty and hesitancy and straightforwardness there is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and where there is Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, there is victory. Through His divine potency He runs the wheel of time, the wheel of the world and the wheel of millennium. He is verily the Lord of Time, Death and the universe consisting of animate and inanimate objects. The great ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i</span> VedavyŒsa, the author of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>  was also present there at that time. Approving of the assertion of SaÛjaya, he says—“O king, whatever SaÛjaya has said is quite true. He truly knows the aspect of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the controller of MŒyŒ, the ancient Being and indweller of all. If you will listen to what he says with undivided mind he will rid you of the fear of the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa arrives in the assembly of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span>with the truce proposal of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> many celestial sages and great ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦is</span> present themselves there in order to listen to the divine and prudent speech of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and listen to His divine speech as if they were spellbound. When Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa finishes his holy speech the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦is</span> one by one support the proposal and try to bring Duryodhana round and simultaneously describe the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. They tell him that Lord NŒrŒyaÄa, the creator of the entire universe, the master of all and the passive observer of the good and evil actions of all, has manifested himself as Ýr¶  K¾¦Äa but sincedoom was looming large on Duryodhan’s head, he did not pay heed to the salutary speech of those great souls, rather being irritated with Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa began to think of some device to imprison him. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa came to know of his craftiness, Scolding him in the presence of all He said—“O wretch, thou thinkest I am all alone unassisted by anyone and that is why thou desirest to overpower me and capture me. But little dost thou know that all the Andhakas, the V¾¦Äis and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> are present here and  dityas, Rudras, Vasus and all the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦is</span> too are present here. Saying so K¾¦Äa laughed heartily. At that very moment BrahmŒ and other gods effulgent like the lightning became visible in His limbs. Their bodies were of the size of a thumb and they were letting off sparks of fire. On the forehead of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was seated BrahmŒ, on his chest, Rudra and on his arms were seated Indra and other guardians of different universes. Not only these but also Agni,  dityas, SŒdhyas, Vasus, AÜvin¶kumŒras, MarudgaÄa, Yak¦as, Kinnaras, Gandharvas and others were present there. From the right arm of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa emanated Arjuna holding the <span class="char-style-override-5">GŒÄÎ¶va</span> and from the left emanated BalarŒma holding the plough as his weapon. Yudhi¦¢hira, Bh¶masena, Nakula, Sahadeva, Pradyumna and the YŒdavas belonging to Andhaka and V¾¦Äi race emanated from the back and stood before Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa nicely equipped with their respective arms. In His arms were bedecked the conch, the disc, the mace and the lotus, the bow called <span class="char-style-override-5">ÝŒrÆga</span> and sword. From His eyes, nostrils and ears came out terrible flames and from the pores of His body streamed forth rays like that of the sun.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Seeing this ferocious form of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa all the kings who were present there began to tremble out of fear and they shut their eyes. Only DroÄa the preceptor, grandfather Bh¶¦ma, Vidura, the great soul SaÛjaya and the great ascetics, ¤Ri¦is, rich in austerities remained seated there unmoved. The Lord had bestowed on them the divine eye. At that instant the gods began to blow trumpets and shower flowers from the sky. At the request of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra the Lord granted the divine eye to him also. He was wonder-struck to look at that divine form. After a little while the Lord withdrew that divine form and at once left the assembly hall (Udyoga Parva 131.1–24). <br/>Do we require any better proof of his Godhood?</p>
<p class="Numbers">(5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In <span class="char-style-override-5">Ýr¶mad Bhagavadg¶tŒ</span> occurring in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Bh¶¦ma Parva</span> we find elaborate descriptions of the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. There he explains to Arjuna very clearly with his own mouth that He is birthless and deathless Lord of all beings. At times He takes birth for the protection of the virtuous and the extirpation of the evil-doers (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 4. 6–8). He further explains that he who knows His divine birth and activities, is freed from transmigration (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 4.9) This shows that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was not an ordinary man like us who are subject to repeated births and deaths. How can one be freed from the rotation of birth and death through knowing the birth of one who himself is subject to birth and death over and over again? He goes on to explain that He is the source of the entire creation and in Him again it dissolves and there is nothing else besides Him (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 7. 6-7). He very clearly explains to Arjuna that veiled by His divine potency He keeps His divinity hidden from others and that is why the ignorant fail to recognize Him and take the unborn and imperishable supreme spirit to be subject to birth and death. Even when Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in His divine form was present on the earth many men like KaÅsa, JarŒsandha, ÝiÜupŒla, Duryodhana and such others existed here who looking Him for an ordinary person often slighted Him. So there is nothing surprising if in His absence the people of the present age hold high or low opinions about Him and put forward unsound reasonings in reference to Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To enable Arjuna perceive His limitless glory, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa out of compassion reveals to him His cosmic form. Arjuna saw the effulgence of a thousand suns bursting forth from His body (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.12). Arjuna beheld within His body gods, <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦is</span> and host of different beings (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.15). He is endowed with numerous arms, bellies, mouths and eyes and having innumerable forms on all sides. Neither His beginning nor middle nor even His end could be seen (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.16). Arjuna also beheld, Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa, KarÄa etc., the principal warriors on the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaurava</span> side are crushed under His terrible jaws (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span>II.4) and all  the  realms being swallowed through His mouth (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.30). Seeing this terrible form of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa Arjuna driven with fear starts singing hymns to God and craves forgiveness for the treatment of his own parity accorded to Him thinking Him only to be a friend. (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.41-42, 44) Noticing Arjuna frightened the Lord withdraws His form of Time spirit (all devouring) and again manifests Himself to Arjuna in the form of ÝyŒmasundara (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.51). Thus the Lord made Arjuna witness that He who is present before him all the time in the form of ÝyŒmasundara capable of attracting the three worlds, is verily the universe itself and keeping Himself unattached from it, causes its creation and destruction and through devotion to Him, He can be known in essence, can be seen and even realized (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.54). So in the end the Lord exhorts Arjuna thus—You should meditate on Me alone, love Me, adore Me and practise My remembrance and relinquishing all other shelters, take refuge in Me (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 18. 65-66).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the last gospel of the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span>. The real aspect of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the same as has found expression in the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span>. He is beyond the world (the perishable matter) superior even to the imperishable soul and the integral whole and the Supreme Person (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 15.18). Such an aspect of Him stands to reason only by taking refuge in Him alone. So to know Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa we have to take refuge in Him (being devoid of pride of wisdom). By taking refuge in Him like Arjuna, He himself will let you know His true aspect. Then uniting our voice with that of Arjuna we shall exclaim—O Lord, through your grace, I have been rid of ignorance. Your true aspect is now clear to me and I will carry out your bidding without any scruple (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 18.73). Hereafter all my undertakings will be guided by the Lord. Though engaged in all sorts of activities actually we will be doing nothing. This is freedom from the bondage of actions as propounded in the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span>. For such people alone has the Lord said that even having slaughtered all these creatures he does not really slay (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 18.17). They simply become an instrument in the hands of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Grandfather Bh¶¦ma, the grand old man of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaurava</span> race was such an instrument in the hands of the Lord. Being pierced through his vital organs with arrows showered by Arjuna he lay on the bed of arrows and was awaiting for the sun to move towards the northern hemisphere, in order to give up his mortal frame of his will. When the war came to an end and Yudhi¦¢hira had been coronated, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa along with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> went to battlefield of Kuruk¦etra with a view to make them listen to the holy exhortations from the mouth of Bh¶¦ma. Noticing Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s arrival Bh¶¦ma was filled with great delight and with inordinate love began to sing His praises. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa also spoke very highly of him and said—“After your giving up the mortal frame and departing to the other world, the entire knowledge shall be lost to the world.” He prayed him to exhort the knowledge to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma said—“My Lord, my mind is tormented with the pain caused by the arrows. Every limb is aching and my intellectual powers have ebbed away. I feel acute burning sensation in the vital parts and my speech is faltering. In such a state how shall I be able to impart instructions. I have lost even the sense of directions. I am sustaining my life-breath only on the score of strength lent by you. So my master, excuse me and be good to instruct the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> yourself. For you alone are the source of all the scriptures. Little to speak of others even B¾haspati (the preceptor of gods) shall feel hesitation in speaking before you. Just as a disciple cannot arrogate himself to take upon him the task of instructing others in the presence of his preceptor, so also man like myself cannot instruct others in your presence (<span class="char-style-override-5">ÝŒnti Parva</span> 3.13). At this Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa blessed that thenceforth he would neither remorse, nor feel senselessness nor burning sensation nor pain, nor shall he be tormented by hunger and thirst. Through My grace, enlightenment shall dawn upon you unsolicited and your intellect shall ever be established in <span class="char-style-override-5">Sattva</span> Mode.” VyŒsa and many other great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦is</span> were present there on that occasion. All of them adored Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa by reciting the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vedic Mantras</span> and hymns and flowers were rained from the sky. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Next day Bh¶¦ma started giving sermons. Through the grace of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa his burning sensation, stupor, tiresomeness, remorse and pain were simultaneously eradicated. He regained the power of mind and speech. Then wonderfully enough he exhorted continuously for a number of days on such important subjects as the duties enjoined on men of different castes and stages in life, the duties of a king, the duties of critical times, the duties of attaining salvation, the duties pertaining to religious rites performed for the deceased, the duties pertaining to the offering of charities and such other topics. At last when the sun actually moved to the northern hemisphere, the high souled Bh¶¦ma establishing himself in <span class="char-style-override-5">Yoga</span> gave up his mortal frame in the presence of Lord K¾¦Äa. At that moment the gods blew trumpets and flowers were strewn from above. The <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> performed his obsequies in the prescribed way.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, having installed <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> as the king of HastinŒpura, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa returned to DwŒrakŒ. On the way He happened to meet the highly glorious <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> named UttaÆka. Hearing from the mouth of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa about the exterminating of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> he flew into great rage. He said­—“O Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> were your relatives and favourite too. Even though wielding power you failed to protect them. You did not dissuade them from fighting by exercising your power. So I must curse you.” Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa  said­—Nobody can slight me by virtue of his austerities, so you must control your anger. I know that you are an ascetic and devoted to your preceptor so I do not desire to set your austerities at naught. Thereafter Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa took pity on him and said—“I alone am the creator and destroyer of the entire created beings. Whenever change of <span class="char-style-override-5">Yuga</span> takes place, I manifest Myself in different species for the good of the common people and for the establishment of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> on a firm footing. When I body Myself forth in a certain species I behave in accordance with the norms of that species. This time I am born as a man, so I behave like a human being. As a man I craved the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> for peace and threatened them with dire consequences but on account of infatuation they turned a deaf ear to Me and that was why all of them were killed. But through fighting they all have attained heavenly state after death (<span class="char-style-override-5"> Üwamedhika Parva</span> 54.15—21). Then at the request of <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> UttaÆka He revealed His Cosmic Form to him and then returned to DwŒrakŒ.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(8)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Likewise of UttaÆka’s wrath Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa had also to become the victim of GŒndhŒr¶’s wrath. At the end of the war in order to perform the funeral of his kinsmen and to offer them water (sacred to the deceased) king Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra had gone to the battlefield of Kuruk¦etra accompanied by the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> GŒndhŒr¶, Kunt¶, Draupad¶ and other female members of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kuru</span> race. There they saw the corpses of sons, brothers, fathers and husbands lying on the ground and birds of prey and carnivorous  animals snatching flesh from their bodies and eating them. Seeing that heart-rending sight the ladies of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kuru</span> race loudly lamenting over their death fell on the ground and raised a piteous cry. The chaste GŒndhŒr¶ devoted to her husband, could not control her grief and fell down senseless. After a short while when she regained her senses she cast an angry look at Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and spoke thus—‘Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, you could if you sincerely desired, prevent this terrible slaughter of mankind. But in spite of your capabilities you would not do so. So on the score of the merit I have earned through the service of my husband I invoke this curse on you that just as you have ignored the doom of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> so also you shall be the cause of inviting the doom of your own kinsmen. In the thirty sixth year from now the ministers of your own race and your sons shall meet their doom and while roaming in the forest unattended by anyone you shall be killed in an ordinary manner and people will not be able even to know about it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If K¾¦Äa had so desired He could have rendered the curse ineffective. But the extirpation of the <span class="char-style-override-5">YŒdavas</span> was what He himself desired. Through the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>war His object of lightening the burden upon the earth was mainly achieved. Now through causing the extirpation of the <span class="char-style-override-5">YŒdavas</span>, the partially unfinished task would be over. But so long as He lived upon the earth none could venture to inflict any harm to the <span class="char-style-override-5">YŒdavas</span>. So making GŒndhŒr¶’s curse the chief cause, He thought it worthwhile to bring about the destruction of His own kinsmen through mutual conflicts. That was why paying due regard to the supernal powers GŒndhŒr¶ acquired by her through dedication to her husband, He gladly took the curse upon Him (<span class="char-style-override-5">Str¶ Parva</span> 25.48–50) and when due time came He got the entire <span class="char-style-override-5">YŒdava</span> race killed in mutual conflicts.</p>
<p class="Numbers">(9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The object of His incarnation having thus been achieved the Lord decided to depart to His supreme abode and for the truthful execution of GŒndhŒr¶’s curse He having controlled His senses, speech and mind was lost in the state of <span class="char-style-override-5">SamŒdhi</span> (unperturbed sustained meditation). Meanwhile through His own motivation a cruel hunter named JarŒ came up there. Mistaking  Him for a deer, he shot an arrow at the sole of one of his feet while He was lying motionless in the state of <span class="char-style-override-5">SamŒdhi.</span> When he approached nearer and realized his mistake, out of fright he held both the feet of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa into his hands. Having consoled him K¾¦Äa left for His celestial abode filling the earth andsky with an amazing brilliance. On that occasion Indra, AÜwin¶kumŒras, <span class="char-style-override-5">Rudras, dityas, Vasus, ViÜvedevas,</span> the sages, the accomplished souls, the fairies and the chief <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span>—all came to escort Him (<span class="char-style-override-5">Mausala Parva</span> 4.23—26). Thus delighting to His own devotees with His all purifying activities directed towards universal good and granting redemption to the wicked on the pretext of extirpating them ended His plays as divine incarnate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thither, when the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> learnt about the extirpation of the YŒdava race and the departure of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to His supreme abode, they were much grieved. They too having installed their grand-son Par¶k¦it, the son of Abhimanyu, on the throne and having deputed Yuyutsu, the son of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra as his caretaker, proceeded towards the HimŒlayas. Having crossed the HimŒlayas, they proceeded towards the mountain called Meru. Meanwhile Draupad¶, Sahadeva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bh¶ma having completed the span of their life one by one dropped down dead. Only <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> Yudhi¦¢hira accompanied by a dog proceeded onwards and arrived at the celestial abode in his mortal frame. There he took bath in the GaÆgŒ, the river of gods, and having given up the mortal human form assumed a divine aspect. In that divine form he arrived at the supreme abode of the Lord. There he beheld Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as consciousness solidified. His weapons such as the Disc and others having assumed divine human form were attending on Him. The valiant and splendrous Arjuna was also in attendance on Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Such is the real aspect of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and such is sweet fruit of developing guileless love of the revered feet of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa through surrender to Him. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is eternal. Even now He offers love to His devotees by granting them His vision and by indulging in playful pranks with them. If we so desire we can be freed from fears forever by taking refuge in His revered feet capable of granting freedom from all fears. Hail to Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äacandraj¶.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Bh¶¦ma—The Great Soul</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bh¶¦ma, the great soul, was the son of King ÝŒntanu, a descendant of the well-known lineage of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kurus</span>. It was goddess GaÆgŒ who begot him. From amongst the gods known as the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vasus </span>it was the ninth Vasu called Dyau who descended upon the earth in the form of Bh¶¦ma in consequence of the curse invoked by the great ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i</span> Vasi¦¢ha. Even as a boy he studied the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vedas</span> along with their corollaries and also learnt through repeated practies the use of divine weapons. While practising the use of weapons once he intercepted the flow of the Ganges with his arrows. In his childhood he was called as Devavrata.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day sage King ÝŒntanu was strolling in the forest. Suddenly his eyes caught sight of a beautiful woman named Satyavat¶, the daughter of the king of <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaivartas</span> and was fascinated towards her. Though Satyavat¶ was verily a princess she was brought up in the house of <span class="char-style-override-5">KaivartarŒja</span>. The condition which her father, the king of <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaivartas</span> put before the king for wooing her, was that the son born of her would be entitled to the kingdom. The king would not accept such a condition but he could not quite dismiss the girl from his mind. He remained melancholy obsessed with the anxiety to get her. When Devavrata came to know the cause of king’s sadness, he himself approached her father the king of <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaivartas </span>and begged for the girl’s hand for his father’s sake. Expressing his agreement to the condition stipulated by him, he took a pledge in the presence of all that the son born to her would be sole heir apparent. But <span class="char-style-override-5">KaivartarŒja</span> would not be satisfied with this much. He thought to himself that Bh¶¦ma’s words would not turn false but the son born to him could be a claimant for the throne. Wise Devavrata did not fail to understand his intention. He at once took another terrible pledge that he would observe celibacy through the whole of his life. Hearing this terrible pledge of adolescent Bh¶¦ma, the gods showered flowers and since then people began to call him by the name Bh¶¦ma (the terrible). Bh¶¦ma escorted Satyavat¶ to his father and entrusted her to him. On hearing the arduous task done by Bh¶¦ma King ÝŒntanu was much pleased and he granted his son the boon of death only at his will.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, in the early years of his life Bh¶¦ma set the example of supreme sacrifice before the world by fulfilling the desire of his father. For the sake of fulfilling a trivial desire of his father he unhesitatingly sacrificed the state for whose sake a sanguinary battle was fought in his own presence only after the gap of a generation or two by his own sons and grand sons. Women and wealth for whose sake there has been so much of bloodshed in the history of the world and a number of states lost their existence, were relinquished by him forever like a grass blade  and thus he acted like a great dispassionate soul. Hail to such a devotion to one’s father!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King ÝŒntanu had two sons born of Satyavat¶’s womb. The name of the elder one was CitrŒÆgada and that of the younger one was Vicitrav¶rya. CitrŒÆgada had hardly entered the threshold of youth when King ÝŒntanu passed away from this world. CitrŒÆgada ascended the throne but soon he was killed in the battle fought with the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span>. Vicitrav¶rya was yet a boy, so he began to look after the affairs of the state under the guardianship of Bh¶¦ma. As years rolled by Bh¶¦ma became concerned about the marriage of Vicitrav¶rya. During those days the <span class="char-style-override-5">SvayaÅvara</span> of the three daughters of the king of Kashi was going to be held. Riding a chariot Bh¶¦ma reached Kashi all by himself. In order to be wedded to his brother, he forcibly abducted the three daughters of the king of Kashi, seated them into his chariot and started towards HastinŒpura. Subsequently all the kings who had gathered there for taking part in the <span class="char-style-override-5">SvayaÅvara</span> rushed at him but their efforts were of no avail. Single handed (though he was), he defeated all of them, and escorting them home handed them over to Vicitrav¶rya. This was the first occasion when the world came to know of his matchless might and skill in the use of weapons.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Of the three daughters of KaÜirŒja who were forcibly taken away by Bh¶¦ma, the eldest called AmbŒ had chosen king ÝŒlva as her husband from the core of her heart. When Bh¶¦ma came to know this he sent her to ÝŒlva and married the remaining two to Vicitrav¶rya. But Vicitrav¶rya did not live long. So after his marriage he became a prey to tuberculosis and left this mortal world. He had no issue and so the question of the lineage of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kurus</span> was at stake. Bh¶¦ma could easily take up the reigns of the state into his hands, if he had so desired. The subjects were verily in his favour. He had now no impediment of any sort in marrying himself but even the greatest persuasion or exigence could not shake him from his solemn pledge. Repeating the solemn pledge made to Satyavat¶’s father he had once asserted—“I can renounce not only the domain of the three spheres, and the heavenly state of BrahmŒ alone but also salvation; but cannot renounce pledge of truth at any cost. Let the five elements give up their inherent properties, let the moon give up his attribute, nay even <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> might deviate from the path of righteousness yet I cannot even dream of forsaking my solemn pledge. Such should be the fulfilment of one’s solemn pledge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now it so happened that ÝŒlva refused to accept AmbŒ. She rolled like pendulum in between. Shamefacedly she could not return even to her father’s place. Holding Bh¶¦ma responsible for her plight she started cursing him from the core of her heart and began to devise plans to avenge him. On the advice of her grandfather (mother’s father) she took refuge in ParaÜurŒma, the son of Jamadagni, and related to him the cause of her grief. It was through ParaÜurŒma that Bh¶¦ma had learnt the use of divine weapons. He called Bh¶¦ma to Kuruk¦etra and said to him—“By overpowering her and touching her you have polluted the girl, so ÝŒlva has refused to accept her. So now you will have to marry her ceremoniously. Bh¶¦ma did not accept his suggestion. He said—this girl told me that she had already given her heart to ÝŒlva. How could then I keep her with me? How can a religious minded person marry one who has given her heart away to someone other than himself? Now ParaÜurŒma burnt with rage as it were. He said—“Bh¶¦ma, little do you know that not less than twenty one times, I have rendered the earth rid of the <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriyas.</span>” “Bh¶¦ma was not yet born” responded Bh¶¦ma. Hearing such a rude reply he challenged Bh¶¦ma to a duel. Bh¶¦ma accepted the challenge and consequently a fierce battle was fought between the preceptor and the disciple. The battle continued for twenty three days but none of them was ready to accept defeat. At last the gods and the sages intervened and brought the rivalry to an end. Thus even by defying the proposal of ParaÜurŒma, he adhered to the truth and through his matchless prowess he put to rout ParaÜurŒma, the matchless archer. It was an example of culmination of bravery and being scrupulously true to one’s promise.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the battle of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> it was Bh¶¦ma alone who was the best warrior on the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas’</span> side. That was why the great honour of being the first commander was bestowed on none but him. Being the grandfather of both the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> he had equal affection and sympathy for both of them and he cherished the desire for the welfare of both of them although he knew that <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and justice were on the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas’</span> side. He had greater sympathy for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> and cherished the desire for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas’</span> victory in his heart. Still in spite of his bias for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> he never granted them any concession on the battlefield and tried to defeat them even at the cost of his life. Out of eighteen days the battle lasted, Bh¶¦ma worked as the commander of <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaurava</span> army for no less than ten days and during that period he slaughtered a large part of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎava</span> armies. Being old he displayed such uncommon valour that in spite of His pledge of not taking up arms Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa had to take up arms twice and face him in order to defend Arjuna. Once finding Arjuna helpless He rushed towards him with disc in His hand and on another occasion He dared Bh¶¦ma with the whip in His hand and thus while saving the life of a devotee and enhancing the glory of the other through His double sided love of His devotees. At last when the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> came to realize that so long as Bh¶¦ma was alive it is impossible to get victory over the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span>, they desired to know from their own grandfather how he could possibly be killed and taking pity on them he revealed the method. He told them that ÝikhaÄÎ¶ the son of Drupada was born a female still though his sex has been transformed, he treated him as a woman and so he could not take up arms against him. He added that in case he would come up before him for a fight, he wouldn’t take up arms against him and at such a moment Arjuna could kill him. Can there be any better example of valour as well as the observance of duties assigned to the <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriyas</span> than this?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having received fatal wounds when Bh¶¦ma fell on the ground, every pore of his body was pierced with arrows. He lay down supported by the arrows. His body did not touch the earth. At that time the sun had been in the southern hemisphere. Death during such a period is considered ominous, so he remained lying with his body supported on the arrows waiting for a change of the movement of the sun towards the other hemisphere for death was at his will by virtue of the boon granted to him by his father. On that eventful day battle came to an end with the fall of Bh¶¦ma. The <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> as well as the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> stood in attention around Bh¶¦ma. The whole of Bh¶¦ma’s body was lying balanced on the arrows. Only his head was swinging downwards. He demanded some sort of support for it. People brought supremely excellent pillows and put them before him but he spurned them. Then he addressed these words to Arjuna—“My son, you do know the <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> of the <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriyas.</span> You arrange for a pillow that may grace me.” Arjuna at once guessed what the bravest of the brave meant. Only a brave person can understand the secret meaning of the hint given by another brave man. He struck arrows which raised his head and supported it. For the treatment of Bh¶¦maj¶  Duryodhana called for royal physicians who were expert in pulling out arrows. Grandfather Bh¶sma sent all of them back with due respect. Being blessed with the state befitting a brave person he considered it insulting to undergo treatment. Everyone was wonder-struck to notice his supreme devotion to <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and extraordinary courage. Even in that state he tried his best for a cease fire and establishing peace between the two sides but he could not be successful in his efforts. Such was the outcome of divine will and none could avert it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The throat of Bh¶¦maj¶ was continuously becoming dry. Due to intolerable pain caused by arrows, He felt burning sensation through the whole of his body. He asked for water. People presented to him stiff necked jars full of cool and fragrant water. Bh¶¦maj¶ refused to accept it. He said—“I would no more enjoy the delicacies enjoyed by the worldly people and hitherto enjoyed by me, for now I am lying on the bed of arrows.” Then he called Arjuna to his presence and said—“My son, you alone can provide me water.” Saying “as you please” Arjuna took out a brilliantly shining arrow from his quiver  and associating it with the divine weapon called ‘<span class="char-style-override-5">Parjanya</span>’ struck it against the ground adjacent to Bh¶¦ma. At once witnessed by all the people, spurted from the earth a celestial stream of water directly fell into the mouth of Bh¶¦maj¶. Bh¶¦maj¶’s thirst was fully quenched with that nectarine  water and he highly praised this act of Arjuna. Since then he denied to himself food and water and so long as he lived  he not only underwent the unendurable pain caused by the arrows but also continued to suffer the pangs of thirst and hunger. Thus he displayed forbearance and power of endurance at its climax. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Noble minded Bh¶¦ma was not only ideally devoted to his parents, scrupulously true to his pledge and exemplary warrior but also possessed profound knowledge of the scriptures, knowledge in essence of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and God and was a notable devotee. Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa himself was full of praise for his profound knowledge. He went to the extent of acclaiming that after his passing away all knowledge shall be enveloped in obscurity and none but he was competent enough to alleviate the doubts that would arise in matters of doubtful nature. Through the inspiration and powers  conferred on him by Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa he exhorted Yudhi¦¢hira continuously for many days on such important subjects as the duties enjoined on men of different castes and stages in life, as the duties of a king, the duties meant for crisis period, the duties for attaining salvation, the duties pertaining to offerings made to the manes, the duties with regard to offering of charities, the duties meant for the womenfolk etc. These exhortations are compiled in the cantos entitled <span class="char-style-override-5">ÝŒntiparva</span> and <span class="char-style-override-5">AnuÜŒsanaparva</span> of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>. It was the work of none else but Bh¶¦ma to alleviate the doubts of Yudhi¦¢hira who was born of an aspect of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma </span>and the very embodiment of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma,</span> relating to duties enjoined on everyone. The great sages like VyŒsa and others had gathered to listen to his exhortations.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Those days very few people possessed such a fair knowledge of the glory and excellence of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as was possessed by Bh¶¦maj¶. Many times he had described the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and Duryodhana. On the occasion of the RŒjasµuya YajÛa while trying to prove the worthiness of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to be adored first, he had described His glory in the crowded assembly hall and established that He was God incarnate. When Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa holding the discus in His hand ran on behalf of Arjuna, he thought it praiseworthy to be killed by His hands and so he invoked Him in order to adore Him by means of weapons. The Vi¦ÄusahasranŒma containing a thousand names of Lord Vi¦Äu narrated by Bh¶¦ma to Yudhi¦¢hira reflects his devotion and knowledge of divinity. Even now that Stotra is held in high esteem by the devotees. Like the G¶tŒ, the Upani¦ads and the Brahmasµutras, Lord ÝaÆkarŒcŒrya has also written a detailed commentary on it. It was the result of his devotion that Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa blessed him by presenting Himself in person at the time of his death. With whatever angle of vision we examine the character of Bh¶¦ma–devotion, knowledge or righteous conduct, we find him an ideal person. Great men talented like Bh¶¦ma are rarely to be found in the history of the world. Though Bh¶¦ma himself died heirless, the Hindus belonging to the three VarÄas(BrŒhmaÄas, K¦atriyas and VaiÜyas) while offering water sacred to their Manes offer him also water. No Indian has received such an honour. That is why the entire world even now calls him by the name ‘Grandfather’. The heirlessness of Bh¶¦ma is really a matter of envy for persons having even many sons.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Yudhi¦¢hira—The Pious One</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Like Bh¶¦ma king Yudhi¦¢hira was also a very high soul. He was born of a fraction of <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span>. He was an embodiment of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span>. That is why people call him <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span>—He was possessed of a number of divine qualities such as forbearance, steadfastness, endurance, humility, compassion and an unshakable love etc. Even in his childhood he had gained great popularity through his modesty, good conduct and thoughtful nature. When he was quite young his father PŒÄÎu, a great soul, left for his celestial abode. Since then he would regard his senior uncle Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra as his father and developed a great respect for him and never disobeyed him. But Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra being crooked by nature began to nurse a grudge against him on account of repeatedly hearing the praises for his good qualities. His son Duryodhana hatched the desire that if somehow the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> left HastinŒpura for some time he should usurp their hereditary rights in their absence and become the virtual king. He gave such a suggestion to his blind and impudent father so as to veer round to his view. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra summoned the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> and proposed that they should go to VŒraÄŒvata to visit the fair. Regarding it as his order they did not raise any objection and in all submission went to VŒraÄŒvata along with their mother Kunt¶. In order to burn them alive Duryodhana had got built over there a house made of lac. They were asked to stay in it. With the help of uncle Vidura, they could somehow manage to escape from there to save their lives and took shelter in a forest. Subsequently the sons of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra taking them to be dead, secretly took  the reigns of HastinŒpura in their hands.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Later on, on the occasion of Draupad¶’s <span class="char-style-override-5">SvayaÅvara</span> when the secret about the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> came to light, the sons of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra came to know that the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were still alive. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra sent message through Vidura and called the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> to him and in order to settle the dispute between his sons and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>, proposed to them to accept half of the territory and settle themselves in KhŒÄÎavaprastha. Yudhi¦¢hira regarding it as his order accepted this proposal as well and he started living at KhŒÄÎavaprastha along with his brothers. There he got built for himself a separate capital which was named as Indraprastha. There he performed <span class="char-style-override-5">RŒjasµuya YajÛa</span> which was attended by a number of kings who offered him valuable presents and acknowledged him as their emperor.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But the sons of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra would not let them live peacefully even there. Duryodhana grew jealous oftheir prosperity. Having built a large central hall he invited the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> for gambling. Though knowing that the gambling is an evil but regarding it as the order of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, Yudhi¦¢hira accepted his invitation and by the deceitful tricks of Duryodhana’s maternal uncle Ýakuni, lost his all; the worse of all this was that the chief queen Draupad¶ had to suffer great humiliation in the crowded hall. Still the feelings of Yudhi¦¢hira for Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra did not undergo any change. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra too was good enough to restore them their territory and all the money and sent them back to Indraprastha. But Duryodhana could not tolerate all this. He induced Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and obtained his consent to call the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> through a messenger and this time the game of dice should be played once again on the condition of ‘banishment.’ Yudhi¦¢hira had once seen the evil consequences of gambling and was in the know of their intention still he could not overlook the order of his senior uncle and breaking his journey midway returned to him. This time too it was Yudhi¦¢hira who lost the game and consequently giving up his all he with his brothers and chief queen Draupad¶ was obliged to go to the forest on exile for twelve years and to live incognito for a year. As an obligation to fulfil the duty of obedience to father he silently suffered all that came his way. Hail to such a devotion to one’s father!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King Yudhi¦¢hira was tolerant and very cautious about the discharge of his duties. He could bear to suffer any loss but the lapse in <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> was unbearable to him. For the first time in gambling when he lost his four brothers, his own self and even Draupad¶ and the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> started humiliating Draupad¶ in the crowded hall, he did not utter a word for he stood duty-bound, he endured everything without a murmur. Even an ordinary person cannot bear to see his wife suffering atrocities in that way. It was out of fear for him, his brothers dared not speak a word and could not give vent to their suppressed feelings. Had they so desired they could have stopped the inhuman atrocities by use of force but considering the fact that DharmarŒja had lost Draupad¶ at stake by his own sweet will they remained silent. The selfsame Draupad¶ the casting of an evil look at whom could be ground enough for one to be deprived of one’s life, was now being reduced to a pitiable condition in their very presence and the mockery of the situation was that they could not even oppose it. Yudhi¦¢hira was aware of the fact that he was deceitfully defeated by Ýakuni still he did not think it proper to give up <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> at his will. Putting up with all odds he did not give up the cause of truth and duty. A better example of one’s love of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and tolerance can hardly be found in the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> having lost the stake for the second time proceeded towards the forest, the inhabitantsof HastinŒpura felt very unhappy. They began to curse the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and givinguptheirhearth and home a considerable number of citizens followed them with a view to accompany them to the forest. Even then <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> did not utter a word against the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and with great effort persuaded all of them to return. Still a number of <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> followed them against their wish. At that moment <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> was a little concerned as to how he would manage to provide food to so many <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> who followed him. He was a little concerned about his own troubles but he could not bear to see others in trouble. However he became successful in obtaining through worship from Sun-god such a pot as would make even a little food cooked in it inexhaustible. During his stay in the forest he would first feed the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> who guested and then himself took food. Even while himself experiencing the inconveniences of the forest life he did not fail to accord due hospitality to guests. Being attracted to him by his love of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> which found expression in that sort of behaviour, the great sages would come to stay with him during his exile and would perform <span class="char-style-override-5">YajÛa</span> and other sorts of religious observances.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King Yudhi¦¢hira was popularly known as <span class="char-style-override-5">AjŒtaÜatru</span> (a man having no enemy at all). In fact he was not unfriendly to anyone. He ever entertained good-will even for those who bore hostility to him. In his view even the enemies deserved service and sympathy. <br/>To do good to the evil-doers is an important mark <br/>of a saint.</p>
<p class="Shlok">उमा संत कइ इहइ बड़ाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मंद करत जो करइ भलाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O UmŒ, the greatness of a saint lies in the fact that he does good even to the evil-doers.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This saying of GoswŒm¶ Tulas¶dŒsa is fully exemplified in the character of king Yudhi¦¢hira. Once it so happened that when the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were staying in Dvaitavana, Duryodhana accompanied by ministers, brothers, the ladies of the apartment, a large army reached the forest with a vile view to make the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> envious of his glory. There he arrived at the pool to play in the waters on whose bank lived Yudhi¦¢hira in a cottage made for himself. Now this pool was already encircled by the demi-gods. Duryodhana entered into a conflict with them. In no time a very terrible and horripilant battle started between them. However the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas </span>(the demi-gods) came out victorious. They took under their custody not only Duryodhana but his queens also. When king Yudhi¦¢hira came to know about it he ordered his brothers to get king Duryodhana liberated by force. “Taking it for granted that they are hostile to us, they are undoubtedly in trouble” said he. “At present it is our solemn duty to help them out dismissing from our minds their evil doings. Hostile though they are, they are undoubtedly our kith and kin. How can we tolerate seeing them ill-treated byothers.” In no time Arjuna overpowered <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span> by showering arrows and freed  Duryodhana as well as his brothers and queens from their captivity. Having come to know about the conspiracy designed by Duryodhana, it was Indra the presiding deity, who had intentionally deputed the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span> to make Duryodhana captive and bring him there. They were wonder-struck to see the large heartedness of king Yudhi¦¢hira. Blessed be the state of having no enemy. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once upon a time leaving behind Draupad¶ alone in the hermitage the<span class="char-style-override-5"> PŒÄÎavas</span> went into the forest. Soon Jayadratha the king of Sindhu, and brother-in-law of Duryodhana came up there. Seeing the matchless grace and beauty of Draupad¶ an evil desire arose in his heart. He put forth his sinful intention before Draupad¶ but she scornfully turned down his proposal. Then he forcibly dragged Draupad¶ and hurling her into the chariot made off with her. Later on, when the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> came to know of his misconduct they chased him and   before long seized him. It took the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> no time to destroy his army completely. Sinful Jayadratha being afraid let Draupad¶ step down from his chariot and himself ran away for his life. Bh¶masena ran after him and having captured him before long, presented him before <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span>. In consideration of the fact that he was a relative <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> took pity on him and let him go and thus showed an extraordinary sense of forgiveness and compassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King Yudhi¦¢hira was not only a profound scholar and well-versed in ethics and <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> but also had excellent sense of equanimity. Once in the forest where the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> dwelt a deer was trying to remove the itching sensation of his horns by rubbing them against the churning wood with its string, belonging to a <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> which were suspended on a tree. The wooden churner got stuck into his horns. The deer ran away with it. Finding it difficult to perform <span class="char-style-override-5">Agnihotra</span> (offering oblations to the fire) the Brahmin approached the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> and prayed them to bring back the wooden churner. <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> Yudhi¦¢hira with his four brothers ran after the deer but in the twinkling of an eye, it disappeared from their sight. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were very much tired besides being overpowered with thirst. At the behest of <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span>, Nakula went out in search of water. Not far away from there he came upon a beautiful pool. Advancing towards it no sooner did he bend down to drink water then he heard an oracle—“First answer my questions then you may drink water.” But Nakula was overpowered with thirst. He paid no heed to that oracle. As a result, as soon as he drank water he lay down dead. Then <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> sent Sahadeva, Arjuna and Bh¶masena one by one but all the three met the same fate. At last <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> himself arrived at the pool. He too heard similar warning and noticed his four brothers lying motionless on the ground. Meanwhile he spied a huge <span class="char-style-override-5">Yak¦a</span> (a demi-god). He told Yudhi¦¢hira that his brothers were reduced to such a miserable condition only on account of drinking water without answering my questions and warned that he would be doomed if he also tried to act in an unsightful manner. Yudhi¦¢hira expressed his consent to answer his questions. Yudhi¦¢hira  befittingly answered to the satisfaction of <span class="char-style-override-5">Yak¦a</span> all the questions asked by him. Being pleased with his answers the <span class="char-style-override-5">Yak¦a</span> said—“O King, I shall revive anyone of your brothers, you want to be revived. <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> expressed the desire that he wanted to see Nakula alive. On being interrogated about his choice he said—“My father had two wives—Kunt¶ and MŒdr¶. The two are equal in my eyes. I wish that each of them should have one son. I’am the son of Kunt¶ and am alive so I desire that one of MŒdr¶’s sons should also remain alive. That is why I have expressed my preference for Nakula instead of Bh¶ma or Arjuna.” This divine play was enacted by <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> embodied in order to test the wisdom and Yudhi¦¢hira’s dedication to <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span>. He was much pleased on noticing such a marvellous sense of equanimity displayed by Yudhi¦¢hira and having revealed his identity to him revived all of his four brothers. <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> further said—“It was I who took  away the wooden churner belonging to the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span>. Here it is you can take it.” Having approached the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa,</span> Yudhi¦¢hira returned him the wooden churner.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yudhi¦¢hira was not only a man of virtuous conduct but also modest. He was very skilled in shaping his behaviour appropriate to the occasion. He was always conscious in offering due respect to elderly people. He did not fail to observe social decorum even in the most strained circumstances. Prior to the breaking out of the battle of <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> when the two armies stood facing each other ready to fight, he entered the enemy forces and made obeisance to grandfather Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa and K¾pŒcŒrya, the preceptors and maternal uncle Ýalya and craved for their blessings. All of these elderly people were very glad at his humility and behaviour worthy of cultured people and from the core of their hearts wished for his victory. All the four persons expressed regret for fighting  under compulsion on behalf of <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> who were unjust, and considered it as their weakness. This ideal behaviour of Yudhi¦¢hira was approved by Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As far as the truthfulness of Yudhi¦¢hira is concerned it was universally acknowledged. He would never resort to falsehood for fear or greed. It was the fruit of his truthfulness that the wheels of his chariot always rolled on a little above the ground. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He uttered a lie only once during his life time. On thepretext of the death of AÜvatthŒmŒ, the elephant, he falsely declared before DroÄŒcŒrya that AÜvatthŒmŒ (the son of DroÄa was dead). On account of this deviation from truth made only once during his life time the wheels of his chariot started rolling on in close proximity to the ground and he was obliged to have a look at the scene—pseudo-hell though for a moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Marvellous was the Yudhi¦¢hira’s magnanimity. When the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> became adamant not to return their territory he agreed to remain contented even if only five villages were released in his favour and sent the message to Duryodhana through Lord K¾¦Äa that he could refrain from fighting if he accepted their proposal of transferring of  five villages to them. But Duryodhana refused to give them in measure to the point of needle-bit of land. Consequently they were forced to fight. Further, when Duryodhana’s entire army having been utterly destroyed and he himself sought shelter in a tank, Yudhi¦¢hira arrived at the tank and challenging him for the last time to a duel said—“You can enter into a combat with anyone of your choice. In case you come out victorious in the duel with any of us you will be entitled to the entire territory.” Who else can dare offer to make such a proposal? It was the work of a high souled personage like Yudhi¦¢hira to put such a proposal before  Duryodhana to combat with whom in the mace-fight even Bh¶ma who was the strongest of all the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎava</span>s, hesitated. At last it was decided that he would enter into combat with Bh¶masena and he was killed by Bh¶masena.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Moreover at the end of the war when Yudhi¦¢hira being coronated to the kingdom when Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and GŒndhŒr¶ began to live with him, he treated them in such a nice way that they forgot the bereavement of their own sons. They afforded them  such comforts as could not be provided with even by their own sons. He sought their advice in managing the affairs of the state and would find out time to serve them. His mother Kunt¶, empress Draupad¶ with her daughters-in-law served GŒndhŒr¶, the revered lady. He was always on the alert that no such occurrence should take place in their presence as might arise in their hearts sorrow for their deceased sons. Yudhi¦¢hira became much grieved when towards the end of their lives they decided to dwell in forest. He himself became ready to follow them to the forest. With great difficulty VyŒsaj¶ tried to bring him round only then he agreed to send Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and GŒndhŒr¶ to the forest. Nevertheless Kunt¶ Dev¶ did follow her husband’s brother and his wife to the  forest, lived in their company till the end attending on them and breathed her last with them also. Before leaving for the forest Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra desired to perform for the last time in the prescribed manner <span class="char-style-override-5">ÝrŒddha</span> ceremony in favour of his dead sons and other relatives and also desired to give away unlimited charities to the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> for their sake. When Yudhi¦¢hira learnt about his desire he sent words through Viduraj¶ alongwith Arjuna that his all including his life were at his disposal. He made necessary arrangements to enable him to spend money more liberally than he desired. Under such circumstances Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra very ceremoneously performed <span class="char-style-override-5">ÝrŒddha</span> for the sake of his relatives and gave away charities to the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> to the satisfaction of his heart. At the orders of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, Yudhi¦¢hira literally let the money flow from the royal treasury like a river. Those who were ordered to be given hundred were given a thousand. When Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and GŒndhŒr¶ set out for the forest the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> alongwith their queens went a long way to see them off. It was the work of none else but of an exalted soul like Yudhi¦¢hira to try his best to provide the amenities of life till the very end and entertain in his heart such firm love for the selfsame Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra on whose account he had to pass through a number of trying circumstances; on whose account he was deprived of his hereditary rights and had to undergo the hardships  of banishment more than once and again in whose presence Draupad¶ the paragon of chastity and devotedness to her husbands, was humiliated in the crowded assembly hall by his sons and was reduced to abject poverty; who refrained from givinghim even five villages which resulted in such a terrible massacre of a number of men on both sides. The example of entertaining such good-will even for one’s enemy is rarely to be found in the history of the world. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Still extraordinary was king Yudhi¦¢hira’s affection and love for those taking refuge in him. He was greatly shocked to hear about the departure of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to His supreme abode and the extermination of the <span class="char-style-override-5">YŒdavas</span>. He began to reflect that the happiness of kingly life was of little avail to him nay, meaningless is even to sustain this life since Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa who was his own kith and kin and well-wisher and by whose grace he had achieved everything, had departed from the world. Let alone the consideration of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa who was the very life-breath and the be-all and end-all of the life of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> who were totally dependent on him in every matter, he was so deeply shocked at the extermination of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> that instead of rejoicing at the victory and the installation as the king that giving up his all he decided to proceed to the forest. With great difficulty and through hard persuasion could Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the great sage VyŒsa and others succeed in making him agreeable for the coronation. Bh¶¦ma <span class="char-style-override-5">PitŒmaha</span> also tried to remove his remorse by exhorting him on matters relating to <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and he did rule his kingdom on receiving the counsel of Bh¶¦ma but the feeling of remorse that aroused in his heart due to assassination of his  kith and kin could never be totally done away with. And now on having heard the news of the departure of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa to his supreme abode he firmly decided to go to the forest. Enthroning Par¶k¦it, the grand son of Arjuna and deputing K¾pŒcŒrya and Yuyutsu, the son of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra as his caretakers and taking with him his four brothers and Draupad¶ set out from HastinŒpura. Going around many countries with the aim of circumambulating the earth (a kind of religious rite) he crossed the Himalayas and made his way towards the mountain called Meru. On the way Draupad¶ and his four brothers dropped down  dead one by one. Not caring for their fall Yudhi¦¢hira proceeded on and on. Meanwhile Indra, the presiding deity seated in his chariot came to receive him and asked to ascend the chariot. Yudhi¦¢hira demurred taking seat in the chariot bereaved as he was for his brothers and the virtuous lady Draupad¶ who regarded him as her life-breath. He consented to ascend chariot only when Indra assured him that they had already arrived at the celestial regions before him. But he had with him a dog too who had been accompanying ever since he started on the journey. Yudhi¦¢hira desired that the dog too should accompany him onwards. When Indra objected to it he frankly told him that he was not ready to enter the celestial regions leaving behind his faithful dog. This dog was none else but <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> himself who was accompanying Yudhi¦¢hira in order to test him. Noticing this matchless affectionateness of Yudhi¦¢hira for those taking shelter with him he revealed himself in his proper form and making Yudhi¦¢hira sit in the chariot in the company of Indra and other gods and celestial sages entered the upper regions. On that occasion celestial sage NŒrada said these words in his praise—“Before Yudhi¦¢hira none is said to have ascended the celestial abode with his physical frame.” Ascending up Yudhi¦¢hira looked upon the stars and planets as realms belonging to different gods. Still he said to Indra, the presiding deity, only this much—“Take me to that realm where I should find my brothers and Dev¶ Draupad¶ for I shall find peace there and there alone. Of what avail is the celestial abode to me where I may not find my brothers?” Hail to such a love for one’s brothers!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Farther on he happened to come across the sights of hell created through illusion by Indra, the presiding deity and there he heard the sound of moaning and groaning of his bretheren. He also heard people say—“Sire, stop for a while your stay here relieves us of the tortures of hell.” Then he stopped there and to the angel who lead him to that place he said—“I must stop here. Since the creatures living here feel happy by my stay here, then this hell to me is far better than the celestial abode. Hail to such compassionateness!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Soon the sight disappeared and Indra and other gods arrived there. All of them were very glad at the expression of such sentiments. They said to him—“Falsely you assured DroÄŒcŒrya of his son’s death. The sights of hell shown to you were also illusory. All your brothers have arrived in the celestial realms.” Thereafter Yudhi¦¢hira entered the supreme abode of the Lord and there he had vision of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in His same form in which he would see Him previously in this mortal world. There he saw Arjuna also attending on the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He also came across Draupad¶ and his brothers at other places. At last he merged himself with his father the embodied <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span>. Thus Yudhi¦¢hira attained supreme state by virtue of observance of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So marvellous was the impact of Yudhi¦¢hira’s piety that the place he visited was permeated with piety. At the time when the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were living incognito in the palace of king VirŒ¢a the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> tried to trace him out. In that context grandfather Bh¶¦ma who knew the glory of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> told them that the generality of the men where Yudhi¦¢hira would be staying, must be generous in giving away charities, sweet tongued, exercising control over sense-organs and modest by nature. They would be freed from such evils as spite, arrogance, envy etc. That placewill ever be echoing with the recitation of the <span class="char-style-override-5">VedicMantras, YajÛas</span> would be performed, the place would be having rain fall at the proper time, that place would have abundance of grains and riches and free from fear of all sorts and natural calamities and the cows would be stout and innumerable. Moreover as has been narrated above even the dwellers of hell enjoyed peace and happiness in their association with him, King Nahu¦a who had to take birth in the family of pythons on account of the curse of the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> Agastya and who had in that very form caught hold of Bh¶ma in his clutches sought emancipation from that form through the <span class="char-style-override-5">DarÜana</span> of and a conversation with Yudhi¦¢hira and attained the celestial regions thereafter. The more we study the character of king Yudhi¦¢hira and dwell upon it the more pious shall we become.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Arjuna—The Bravest of the Brave</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjuna was the very incarnation of <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> named Nara. He was a great devotee of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and also His friend and lover and a good instrument in his hand. In the battle of <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>, by making him His instrument the Lord had slain many great warriors and in this way He relieved the earth of its burden—the supreme goal of His manifestation. On the occasion of revealing His Form Universal, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa has acknowledged this saying—“These enemies of yours already stand slain by me. You have to be only an instrument in slaying them” (XI.33). Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa has accepted him as a friend and  devotee by acclaiming in the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> itself—“You are my friend and devotee too. You are extremely dear to Me and so on. He, whom the Lord Himself accepts as his friend and beloved one and declares him as such, requires no further proof of his devotion. In the concluding part of the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span>, while promising—“I shall carry out your bidding” Arjuna himself pledged to be an instrument of the Lord and a careful study of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> confirms the fact that he is very particular about fulfilling his promise till the end. The <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> further bears out the fact that he looked upon Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as his friend and regarded Him as his equal. Arjuna and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa lived together for many months at various places and on such occasions it was but natural for them to sit, to walk, to eat and drink and to lie and sleep together and as such there was no scope for the observance of formalities in their mutual behaviour. They made frank dealings with each other, there was intimate cordiality between them and they had free access to the inner apartment of each other’s palaces where they stayed and moved together and no privacy was observed by them in respect of each other. The sort of love they had for each other is reported by SaÛjaya at the time of delivering the message of <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra. When the battle had not yet started SaÛjaya went to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in Upaplavya with the message of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span>. The informal state in which he found Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna is reported to the king thus—“Sire, to deliver the message to Arjuna, I entered the inner apartment, access to which place was forbidden even to Abhimanyu, Nakula and Sahadeva. There I saw K¾¦Äa stretching his legs in the lap of Arjuna and Arjuna stretching his in the lap of Draupad¶ and SatyabhŒmŒ.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">  When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> repaired to the forest as per terms of gambling, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa visited them. On this occasion He refers to his own identification with Arjuna and affirms—“I am solely yours and you are solely Mine. Those, whom you regard as your own, are Mine and those whom, I regard as Mine, are yours. He, who envies you, envies Me and he who envies Me, envies you and he, who loves you, loves Me. You are Nara and I am NŒrŒyaÄa. I am identified with you even so you are identified with Me. We are not at variance with each other. We are essentially one.” Many events in <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> reveal to us how dearly Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa loved Arjuna and what great intimacy existed between them. During the period of exile when Arjuna reached PrabhŒsak¦etra in connection with the pilgrimage, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa on hearing of him soon leaves DwŒrakŒ for PrabhŒsak¦etra in order to meet him and having brought him from there to mount Raivataka, spends many days there in his company. From the mount Raivataka the two come to DwŒrakŒ where Arjuna stays for many days in the palace of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as his favourite guest and at night both sleep together. There when he comes to know that Arjuna wants to marry His sister SubhadrŒ, he consents to it without being asked and also tells him the device of abducting her by force. Not only this much he gives him His chariot and His weapon as well. When BalarŒmaj¶ opposes this he persuades him and obtains his consent to it and it is at DwŒrakŒ that the marriage of SubhadrŒ is solemnized. Again in the context of the great fire at KhŒÄÎava, Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa prays to Indra for the boon of ever increasing friendship with Arjuna. In that very context we find another example of great intimacy between Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna. A demon named Mayawas trying to escape from the terrible fire that had blazed forth in the forest of KhŒÄÎava. The Fire-god in his divine manifestation was chasing him in order to burn him to ashes. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa too with His discus rushed to help Fire-god kill him. Finding no means of escape he took shelter with Arjuna who granted him <span class="char-style-override-5">‘AbhayadŒna’</span> (freedom from all fears). Now Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa withdrew His discus and Fire-god ceased chasing him. The life of Maya, the demon, was saved. Maya, the demon, wanted to render Arjuna some service in return for his kindness. Arjuna said that he would be duly served only if he served Ýr¶  K¾¦Äa. Maya, the demon, was a skilled architect. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa got a very beautiful assembly hall built by him for emperor Yudhi¦¢hira. Thus Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna always tried to do things that were pleasing to each other.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa loved Arjuna so also Arjuna considered him as his dearest kinsman and well-wisher. That was why he preferred, alone Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa without arms as his helper to His army consisting of a thousand million soldiers. When choice is to be made between the Lord and His bounteous gifts the true devotee leaving aside His gifts, chooses the Lord Himself. Being overwhelmed with the feeling of love, Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa consented to be his charioteer on the battlefield. Entrusting also the reigns of the chariot of his life to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Arjuna freed himself from anxiety forever. Now the responsibility of Arjuna’s protection and victory was shifted on the shoulders of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the omnipotent Lord. It is His pledge that if one meditates on with undivided mind and leaves all matters of concern to Him, He takes upon Himself the task of looking after one’s best interests and needs. One may test the veracity of such a pledge by surrendering himself to Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How fine it was. Now the entire responsibility of helping Arjuna to come out victorious and protecting him from terribly powerful warriors like Bh¶¦ma came on the shoulders of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Nevertheless it was presupposed that the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> would come out victorious for <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> was on their side i.e, their cause was just. K¾¦Äa is always on the side of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and where there is K¾¦Äa, there is victory—this is a perpetual truth. To make Arjuna invoke RaÄacaÄÎ¶, the goddess of war, just before the beginning of war and sing hymns to her in order to gain her favour in defeating the enemies and to crave for her blessings after having the vision of her manifest form, to remove his delusion through the teachings of the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> and granting him the vision of the Cosmic Form; to rush at Bh¶¦ma for protecting the life of Arjuna, helpless as he was in   defending himself against the shower of arrows upon him by Bh¶¦ma in the first instance with the wheel and in the second instance, with a lash in His hand to the utter neglect of the pledge that He would not lift weapons during the battle; to endure against his chest the evil effect of Vai¦ÄavŒstra hurled by Bhagadatta the all devastating weapon, to save Arjuna from the serpent mouthed arrow hurled by KarÄa by pressing the chariot hard under His feet and to keep in order Arjuna’s chariot which was almost burnt by the impact of the arrows, through His firm resolve these and such others were the divine sports of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa which he performed for safeguarding the best interests and needs of Arjuna.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nine days had passed but the battle between Bh¶¦ma and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> had not ended. Still Bh¶¦ma’s military prowess was not on the decline. Daily he was killing thousands of warriors of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎava </span>army. The <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were in a fix how to gain victory over him. In a pathetic tone Yudhi¦¢hira narrated the whole circumstances to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa who was at the helm of all affairs. Whatever Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said in order to console him, reveals His extraordinary love for Arjuna. At the same time it also reveals that he held Arjuna in a very high esteem. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa spoke thus: <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span>, you need not worry at all, You feel that victory will be ensured with the slaying of Bh¶¦ma. I can by Myself put an end to his life. Your brother Arjuna is my friend, kinsman and disciple as well, if needed I am ready to cut the flesh of my body for his sake and he too can give up his life for My sake. In Upaplavya Arjuna had taken vow in the presence of all to kill Bh¶¦ma and I have to see that it is not broken. I must do whatever Arjuna asks Me to do. Moreover, it is not at all difficult for Arjuna to kill Bh¶¦ma. O king, if Arjuna makes up his mind, he can perform even an impossible task. If all the gods accompanied by giants and demons stand against Arjuna in the battlefield, Arjuna can defeat them all, far less to speak of Bh¶¦ma alone. It is true that nothing is impossible for one who is protected and helped by the Lord who is capable of doing and undoing as well as averting the destiny.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Tormented with the bereavement of his son Abhimanyu and holding Jayadratha mainly responsible for Abhimanyu’s death overwhelmed with emotions Arjuna makes a pledge of killing Jayadratha before the sunset and at the same time he also pledges that in case he failed to do so by the next evening he would fling himself into fire. According to the words of the Lord viz., “I safeguard the best interests and needs of My devotees the responsibility of the fulfilment of Arjuna’s pledge falls on the shoulders of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Arjuna was carefree as he exclusively depended on Lord K¾¦Äa. On the other side, however, no efforts were spared to safeguard the life of Jayadratha. The same day Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa awoke at midnight and calling to him, DŒruka the charioteer, said—“DŒruka, wife, friends, brothers and kinsmen—none of these is dearer to Me than Arjuna, I cannot bear the sight of the world bereft of Arjuna even for a moment. Such a thing will never happen. Only tomorrow the world will get a proof of my friendship with Arjuna. He who is envious of him envies Me also. He, who is favourable to him, is favourable to Me also. Grasp it fully well that Arjuna is half of my body. I believe, tomorrow Arjuna will be successful in killing any of the warriors he chooses to kill.” What doubt could there be in the victory of one to whom the Lord, favourably disposed to His friends, is so favourably inclined. The next day Arjuna fulfilled his promise by killing Jayadratha through the device suggested by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and the world stood witness to the fact that Arjuna was not the least harmed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">KarÄa was envious of Arjuna since the very beginning. Both were at daggers drawn with each other. Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa thought that after the death of Bh¶¦ma the greatest danger to the life of Arjuna was only from KarÄa. He had an unfailable and powerful missile bestowed to him by Indra which he kept reserved for being used against Arjuna. Being in possession of that divine power he considered Arjuna’s life at his mercy. It could be used only once. To deprive KarÄa of that miraculous power, the Lord made Gha¢otkaca, the son of Bh¶masena, fight with him. He displayed such a marvellous valour that the life of KarÄa seemed to be at stake. Unable to endure his strokes and finding no way out KarÄa had to use the powerful missile given by Indra, against Gha¢otkaca and it put an end to his life. The event of the death of Gha¢otkaca enveloped the encampments of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎava</span> army with a gloom. Tears burst out from every eye. But Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was much pleased at this event. He began to dance with joy. Embracing Arjuna he patted him on his back and made repeated outcry. Arjuna enquired of Him about the cause of His untimely joy for he knew that no activity of the Lord was unmotived. Whatever Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said in reply, reveals His limitless love for Arjuna. He said—O Arjuna, today is, of course, the day of great rejoicing  for Me. If you want to know the reason, listen to Me. You think it was KarÄa who killed Gha¢otkaca, but I say that on account of the missile given by Indra, made ineffective, it is rather Gha¢otkaca who has killed KarÄa. Now you can consider KarÄa as good as dead. No man had the power to stand against KarÄa as long as he wielded that missile. He further said: “It was for your welfare that I got JarŒsandha, ÝiÜupŒla and others slain one by one. Had they not been slain earlier they would have posed a grave threat now. Having enmity with us they would surely have sided with the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and with the support of Duryodhana, they would have conquerred the entire earth. I have manifested myself only to kill such people as are enemies of gods.” It was in this very context that he said to SŒtyaki­—“Everyone on the side of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> advised KarÄa not to use the missile against anyone else except Arjuna. He too had it in his mind all the time but it was I who would put him in a dilemma. That is why he could not use the missile against Arjuna. O SŒtyaki, “The idea that this missile is nothing but the death itself for Arjuna–haunted in my mind and I had to spend sleepless nights. Having been used against Gha¢otkaca this day, it has been rendered of no further use now I think that Arjuna is free from the jaws of death. I regard the safeguarding of Arjuna’s life more significant than safeguarding the lives of my own parents and relatives like you; nay even My own life. Bereft of Arjuna, I do not aspire for anything whatsoever, be it rarer though than even the kingship of the three worlds. As much I am puffed up with joy as though Arjuna has gained a new lease of life. That is why I deputed Gha¢otkaca to enter into a combat with KarÄa this night. None but he could overpower KarÄa.” These words of the Lord reveal how dearly He loved Arjuna and how careful He was about his safeguard. The best interests of the man who makes himself an instrument of the Lord whosoever he may be is safeguarded in this way by the Lord and he is protected by Him from all sorts of harms. Foolish must be the men who, forsaking the resort to the Lord who is so affectionately disposed to His  devotees, seek shelter in others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Driven to anger by the slaying of DroÄŒcŒrya, valiant AÜwatthŒmŒ used gneyŒstra (the weapon causing fire) against the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>. As soon as it was shot, showers of arrows hailed down from above and fire spread on all sides. Followed by an Ak¦auhiÄ¶ army (A mixed unit of army composed of 21,870 chariots as many elephants, 65,610 horses and 1,09,350 fort) Arjuna alone was pitched against AÜwatthŒmŒ, terribly hit by that weapon his army was so badly scorched and burnt that it was driven out of extinction but the bodies of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna were not the least affected. AÜwatthŒmŒ was amazed and worried as to how the two great souls could afford to be unaffected. Casting away the bow from his hand he jumped off the chariot and left the battlefield crying out; ‘Fie! Fie!’ Meanwhile he came across VyŒsaj¶. He made obeisance to him and asked him how it was that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna were not the least affected by that all devastating weapon. VyŒsaj¶ said—“Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the manifestation of the <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> named ‘NŒrŒyaÄa’ and Arjuna is the manifestation of the <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> named ‘Nara’ and is as glorious as ‘NŒrŒyaÄa’ himself. These two ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦is</span> manifest themselves age after age to keep people within the proper limits of righteousness. Hearing these words of VyŒsaj¶, AÜwatthŒmŒ’s doubts were removed and he developed an esteem for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna. These words of VyŒsaj¶ go to prove the identification of Arjuna and Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As it was, Arjuna was the favourite of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa but he enjoyed the inordinate grace of Lord ÝaÆkara as well. During the battle when he was wrecking havoc on the opposite army he always noticed a sublime person like fire ablaze, always moving in front of chariot. In fact it was He who was destroying the enemy forces but people wrongly credited Arjuna for the work. He was  invested with a three forked lance (Trident) and was refulgent like the sun. During the conversation with VyŒsaj¶, he told Arjuna that he was none else but ÝaÆkara himself. There is nothing to wonder at if others bestow their grace on one who enjoys the favour of Lord K¾¦Äa—<span class="char-style-override-7">‘‘जा पर कृपा राम कै होई। ता पर कृपा करहिं सब कोई॥’’</span>(He who enjoys the favour of Lord RŒma virtually receives the favour of all.)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides being a great devotee and favourite of the Lord, Arjuna had many other virtues also. It was but natural; just as shafts of light accompany the sun, so also other divine virtues concord with adoration of the Lord. He was patient, brave, compassionate, tender-hearted, true to his vows and exercised control over his senses. He had in him inborn divine qualities. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa has affirmed this in the G¶tŒ saying—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘‘सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि’</span>’.At the time of his birth a oracle spoke—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Kunt¶, this child will grow to be as valiant as KŒrtav¶rya Arjuna and Lord ÝaÆkara and shall enhance your prestige by becoming unconquerable like Indra. Just as Vi¦Äu had pleased his mother Aditi, in the same way he will provide you joy.” This voice was not only heard by Kunt¶ but by all. The sages, the gods and all living beings were pleased to hear this. Trumpets were blown from above and flowers were strown. In this way his divinity was evident since his very birth. When he grew up the task of teaching him, his brothers and Duryodhana etc., the sons of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra was first entrusted to K¾pŒcŒrya and then to DroÄŒcŒrya. KarÄa commonly known as <span class="char-style-override-5">Sµutaputra</span> (the son of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Sµuta</span>) also received his education along with Arjuna. Of all the disciples of DroÄŒcŒrya Arjuna alone surpassed all in the field of education, physical power, effortfulness, swiftness and adroitness and in the exercise of all types of weapons. He served DroÄŒcŒrya whole heartedly. Being pleased with his service, devotedness and intelligence, one day DroÄŒcŒrya said to him—“I shall see that no man in the world stands a match for you in archery.” Can the firm resolve of an accomplished preceptor like DroÄŒcŒrya ever remain unfulfilled?” Arjuna indeed turned out as the best archer in the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎava</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaurava</span> princes completed practice in the exercise of weapons and the occasion for paying the fee to the preceptor cropped up, DroÄa, the preceptor, said to them—“Make Drupada, the king of PŒÛcŒla, a captive in the battlefield and bring him here—this would be the best fee that you can possibly pay me.” All of them cheerfully agreed to carry out the orders of their preceptor and having equipped themselves with proper arms and riding is chariot invaded the capital of king Drupada. When they reached there the king of PŒÛcŒla accompanied by his brothers encountered them. At first the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> had made an attack on him all by themselves but were obliged to retreat after being defeated by the king of PŒÛcŒla. Lastly Arjuna accompanied by Nakula and Sahadeva attacked king Drupada. In the twinkling of an eye Arjuna overpowered king Drupada and making him a captive escorted him to DroÄŒcŒrya. This event earned Arjuna a universal recognition of his valour.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having come to know about the <span class="char-style-override-5">SwayaÅvara</span> of Draupad¶ the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were on their way to the capital of Drupada from EkacakrŒ. On the way they had an encounter with the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span>. With his skill in the use of weapons, Arjuna fully overpowered  the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span> and made their king AÆgŒraparÄa (Citraratha) their captive. At last they came to be on friendly terms with each other. In the <span class="char-style-override-5">SwayaÅvara</span> of Draupad¶ Arjuna, to the surprise of all performed the task which none of the kings present in the <span class="char-style-override-5">SwayaÅvara</span> could do. Duryodhana, ÝŒlva, ÝiÜupŒla, JarŒsandha, Ýalya and other valiant kings and princes tried to take up the bow and draw its string but all of them failed. But in no time did Arjuna take up the bow, drew up the string and in the twinkling of an eye pierced the target through. At that time Arjuna had disguised himself as a <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa.</span> Taking him as a BrŒhmaÄa all the kings joined together to overcome him. But they could not do even the least harm to either Arjuna or Bh¶ma. At that time Arjuna was engaged in bow fight with KarÄa and Bh¶ma was engaged to Ýalya in the mace fight. But the rival combatents had to suffer defeat at the hands of Arjuna and Bh¶ma.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the event of the great conflagration at KhŒÄÎava also Arjuna had displayed marvellous prowess. When with the help of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna the Fire-god set the KhŒÄÎava forest on fire, being severely oppressed with the great heat the gods approached their king Indra. Then at the command of Indra the clouds joined together and started pouring torrential rain in order to put out the terrible fire. With the miraculous power of his weapon, Arjuna intercepted the torrents mid-way in the sky and did not let them come upon the earth. Indra too retaliated by hurling sharp arrows at Arjuna. Then a fierce battle was fought between the two sides. Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna conjointly with the help of the discus and sharp arrows, played havoc on the army of gods. At that time Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa revealed Himself as ‘Death incarnate.’  The gods and demons both were wonder struck to see His power. At last the oracle addressing Indra, said—“By no means can you defeat Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna in the battle. They are the very manifestation of Nara and ‘NŒrŒyaÄa. Limitless is their power and valour. They are unconquerable by one and all. You must depart from here along with all the gods, for your honour lies in this alone.” Hearing the oracle, the king of gods retreated with his army and in no time did the fire consume the entire forest. Being pleased with Arjuna the Fire-god bestowed on Arjuna miraculous weapons. Indra too, being pleased with his skill in the use of weapons, promised to give him weapons at the opportune time and at the request of Fire-god, VaruÄa the water-god bestowed on him an inexhaustible quiver, the <span class="char-style-override-5">GŒÄÎ¶va</span> bow and a chariot invested with banner that was imprinted with the auspicious symbol of monkey even before the battle started.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> having lost second time in the game of dice began to dwell in the forest, (one day) <span class="char-style-override-5">Mahar¦i</span> VedavyŒsa came to them and escorting Yudhi¦¢hira in seclusion explained to him that Arjuna the constant companion of NŒrŒyaÄa was none else than the great ascetic ‘Nara’. None can overpower him. He is the manifestation of Acyuta. By the dint of his penance and valour he is capable of having the vision of gods. So direct him to Lord ÝaÆkara, Indra the king of gods, VaruÄa, Kubera and to <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span>  for the sake of acquiring the knowledge of weapons. Having received weapons from them he will display great valour, and will restore to you your lost kingdom. Acting on the advice of VedavyŒsaj¶ and having initiated Arjuna into the knowledge of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantras</span> imparted by him, Yudhi¦¢hira sent Arjuna to mount Indrak¶la to have a vision of Indra. On reaching there he had the vision of Indra in the form of an ascetic. Indra tempted him with the allurement of the engagement of heavenly enjoyments and glories but rejecting all, he insisted on him only to impart him the knowledge of weapons. Indra said—“At first you should have the vision of Lord ÝaÆkara through performing penance. Having been blessed with His vision you should come to heaven, then I shall bestow on you all the divine weapons.” Arjuna had undoubtedly the sense of dedication to purpose. He was lost in a severe penance. Being pleased with his penance Lord ÝaÆkara manifested Himself before him in the form of a Bh¶la (a tribe of denizens). A dispute arose between the two over a pig which resulted in a fight. Through his adroitness in the use of weapons he earned the favour of Lord ÝaÆkara. He spoke—“O Arjuna, I am pleased at your efficient discharge of the task. There is no <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriya</span> as endurant and brave as you. In sublimity and power you are my equal. You are the ever existing ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i.</span> I bestow on you divine knowledge. You shall be able to win over the gods even.” Thereafter granting him His vision along with His consort PŒrvat¶  Lord ÝaÆkara trained him thoroughly in the use of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÜupata</span> weapon. Thus having  earned the favour of MahŒdeva the supreme among gods he was making up his mind to have an access to heaven, when VaruÄa, Kubera, Yama, and DevarŒja—the guardians of all the four quarters, presented themselves there. There Yama, VaruÄa and Kubera bestowed on him weapons called <span class="char-style-override-5">DaÄÎa, PŒÜa</span> and <span class="char-style-override-5">AntardhŒna</span> and Indra promised him to give weapons on his coming to heaven and the knowledge of archery also. After this seated in chariot sent by Indra, Arjuna went to Heaven and staying there for five years received the training into the use of divine weapons and simultaneously acquired from Citrasena—the knowledge of music as well. After receiving the knowledge when Arjuna became skilled in the use of all sorts of weapons Indra asked him to slay the demons called NivŒtakavaca. They lived at an inaccessible place under the waters. They were supposed to be thirty million in number. Even the gods could not overcome them. Arjuna all by himself managed to slay them all. Besides this, while returning he had a fight with the demons named KŒlakeya and Pauloma and put an end to their lives too. Thus having done the things desired by Indra and staying in his city called Indrapur¶ for some time more Arjuna returned to his brothers.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On returning from heaven while living in forest and even while staying at VirŒ¢anagara incognito Arjuna displayed marvellous valour. In the forest he fought with the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span> in order to set Duryodhana and others free from bondage, a reference to which has been made earlier in the context of drawing a character sketch of Yudhi¦¢hira. When the period of twelve years of exile came to an end and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were staying with VirŒ¢a for fulfilling the term of living one year incognito, Duryodhana invaded VirŒ¢anagara with the motive of tracing them out. He was accompanied by Bh¶¦ma, KarÄa, K¾pa, AÜwatthŒmŒ and other chief warriors. They made their way home gathering round as many as sixty thousand cows of king VirŒ¢a. Then Uttara, the son of king VirŒ¢a with Arjuna (disguised as B¾hannalŒ) as his charioteer went to intercept their advancement. Uttara’s hair stood on an end when he looked  at the large army of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and jumping out of the chariot he took to his heels. Then B¾hannalŒ (Arjuna) tried to catch  hold of him and brought him round and making him his charioteer, himself began to fight, one by one he defeated KarÄa, K¾pŒcŒrya, DroÄa, AÜwatthŒmŒ and Duryodhana and made Bh¶¦ma loose his sense. Then Bh¶¦ma, Duryodhana, KarÄa, Du¬ÜŒsana, ViviÅÜati, DroÄŒcŒrya, AÜwatthŒmŒ and K¾pŒcŒrya all these chief warriors jointly rushed at Arjuna and they surrounded him from all sides but Arjuna swayed them by the showers of his arrows. Lastly he brought out the missile called <span class="char-style-override-5">Sammohana</span> (the hypnotizing weapon) which rendered all the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaurava</span> warriors senseless and let the weapons fall off their hands. Had Arjuna so desired he would have killed them all at such a time but he was above all such petty considerations. When they came to sense as advised by Bh¶¦ma, they thought it desirable to return leaving the cows behind. Trumpeting his victory Arjuna returned to the city. Thus Arjuna paid off many times the debt of one who provided him shelter by saving not only his cows but his prestige also. Blessed be such a faithfulness to one’s master.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjuna was decidedly one of the important characters of <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>. He was also the chief commander of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎava</span> army. It was he whose charioteership was accepted by Lord K¾¦Äa and it was he again who faced invincible warriors like Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa, KarÄa and AÜwatthŒmŒ in battle. All of them accepted his supremacy. The valour and skill in use of weapons which he displayed on the day Jayadratha was killed was worthy of him alone. Learning of his pledge that day the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> had made Jayadratha stand behind the legions of their army. Making his way through large legions of army consisting of elephantry, cavalry, soldiery and charioteers, Arjuna was steadily advancing towards his goal with firm dedication and indomitable zeal. Thousands of warriors and elephants and horses had fallen victim to his infallible arrows. He would bring destruction of soldiers falling within the circumference of two miles from his chariot. In the meantime evening shadows began to fall. His horses were greatly tormented on account of the arrows that had pierced their bodies and were extremely tired on account of excessive work-load. Hunger and thirst was oppressing them all the more. Arjuna asked Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—“Please let loose the horses and pull out the arrows. Meanwhile I shall manage to check these <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> from advancing.” Saying so Arjuna jumped off the chariot and exercising great care took up the bow and firmly stood at one place. Knowing this to be the golden opportunity for overpowering him the warriors on the opposite side all at once surrounded him on all sides and enveloped him with arrows and a variety of weapons but obstructing their force with his weapons enveloped all of them instead with his arrows. Meanwhile Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa informed Arjuna that the horses were oppressed with great thirst but there was no pool nearby. At this Arjuna breaking the earth through with his divine weapons created a beautiful pool of water as was suitable for the horses to drink at. Besides he raised the structure of a house with the help of his arrows over it. Noticing this miraculous valour of Arjuna, the <span class="char-style-override-5">Siddhas</span> (the accomplished ones) bards and the soldiers were struck with great amazement and began to applaud him. The greatest wonder was that though Arjuna was fighting afoot, even the greatest of warriors failed to force him to retreat. Meanwhile Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa swiftly pulling out the arrows from the horses’ bodies bathed them, rubbed them and made them drink  water and eat grass and making them lie down on the ground again yoked them to the chariot. When Arjuna approached Jayadratha he was attacked by a group of eight warriors and Duryodhana in order to save his brother-in-law garrisoned him from all sides but encountering them all Arjuna kept on marching ahead. Nobody dared stop his forceful penetration. By the grace of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa he, however, made Jayadratha the prey to his adamantine arrow by the sunset and according to the directions of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa he however, cut off his head with such a skill that his head crossed the borders of Kuruk¦etra and fell into the lap of his father. Thus with the help of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, Arjuna fulfilled his pledge by killing Jayadratha before the sunset.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjuna was not only a matchless archer and a valiant fighter unchallenged in the world, but also was pre-eminently true to his words and a virtuous and righteous man who exercised control over his senses. During the time the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> ruled over Indraprastha one day some bandits made off with the cows belonging to a <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa.</span> The <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> came to them and cried out for their help. Arjuna heard the pitiable cry of the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> and promised him to bring back his cows. But his arms were lying in the room where his elder brother, emperor Yudhi¦¢hira, was sitting in seclusion with Draupad¶. It was previously agreed upon by the five brothers that while Draupad¶ was in seclusion with any of the five brothers if anyone of them ventured to enter the room, he would have to spend twelve years in the forest practising continence. Arjuna was in a great dilemma. If he did not protect the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> cows, he would infringe the duties of a <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriya</span> and in case he entered the room for taking out the arms for their sake, he would violate the concord. At last Arjuna decided to violate the concord in order to save the cows of the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span>. He argued to himself. “It is my solemn duty to protect the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> cows and to punish the wrong-doers, however severe be the atonement for the violation of the concord or even if it entails the risk to my life, for the fulfilment of duties is more important than even to save my life.” Blessed be the devotedness to one’s duty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjuna entered the room of Yudhi¦¢hira unnoticed, and took out the arms and having chased the bandits without any loss of time, brought back the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> cows. After returning from there he asked for his elder brother’s permission to go to the forest for atonement. Yudhi¦¢hira explained to him–“There is no error if a younger brother happens to come in at a time when the elder one is sitting beside his wife. If there is any error at all it concerns me alone and I readily excuse it. Moreover, that you violated the concord and it was only for the sake of discharging your duty; therefore, you needn’t go to the forest.” Here was an opportunity for Arjuna to escape from the obligation of the atonement. Had there been any other man in Arjuna’s place, he would not have missed such an opportunity. Now-a-days it is a common practice with the people to resort to law to save themselves from the clutches of law itself but on no pretext would Arjuna escape punishment. In spite of Yudhi¦¢hira’s express consent he thought it proper to abide by the code of conduct for the sake of upholding the cause of truthfulness and having received necessary instructions for dwelling in forest, started from there. Blessed be the adherence to one’s vows and dedication to the observance of code of conduct.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day while Arjuna was staying at Indrapur¶ and was acquiring the knowledge of the use of divine weapons and music, Indra sent UrvaÜ¶, the fairest of the fairies to Arjuna to attend on him. That day Indra had marked Arjuna gazing with unwinking eyes at UrvaÜ¶ in the assembly. UrvaÜ¶ was already enamoured of the handsome personality and accomplishments of Arjuna. Asked by Indra she went to Arjuna after embellishing herself in the most sophisticated manners. Seeing UrvaÜ¶ thus approaching him at night all by herself  casting away all sense of propriety, Arjuna stood still in amazement. Out of most modesty he shut his eyes and made obeisance to UrvaÜ¶ as if she were his mother. UrvaÜ¶ was stunned to see this. She did not expect Arjuna to behave that way. Frankly she gave vent to her lustful feelings. Now, Arjuna was immensely overweighted with the sense of shame. He  closed both of his ears with his hands and said—“What say you, mother? Undoubtedly you are as good as the wife of my preceptor. In that assembly of gods I did look at you intently but I had no evil thoughts in my heart. I was arguing to myself that you must be the mother of Puru race. That is why I looked at you so intently. Revered lady, you must not take it otherwise. In my eyes you are the eldest of all the elderly persons and the progenitor of my ancestors. Just as Kunt¶, MŒdr¶ and Ýac¶, the wife of Indra, are mothers to me so also being the progenitor of the Puru race, you are virtually my revered mother. I bow down at your revered feet to offer my salutations.” Now UrvaÜ¶ was highly enraged. She cursed him thus—“I came to you at the direction of Indra, driven as I was by lust but you have kicked at my loving heart so you will be obliged to live like a male dancer in the midst of women and you will be branded with the name ‘eunuch’ by the people. Arjuna cheerfully accepted the curse upon him but did not shun his duties. It was the work of none else than Arjuna to avoid an exceedingly beautiful lady like UrvaÜ¶ who had wilfully come to him all alone in seclusion. Blessed be such control of senses. When  Indra came to know about it he called for Arjuna, patted him on his back and said–“My son, blessed is your mother to have you for her son. In self-control you have  even surpassed the <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦is</span>. Don’t worry at all. The curse pronouned  by UrvaÜi will prove to be a boon for you. In the thirteenth year from now when you will have to remain incognito unidentified, this  curse will help you hide your identity from others. At the end of that period manliness will be restored to you. It is truly said–<span class="char-style-override-9">‘</span><span class="char-style-override-10">‘धर्मो रक्षति रक्षित:</span><span class="char-style-override-9">’’</span>(Whoever protects <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> stands protected by <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span>). When the period of remaining unidentified at VirŒ¢anagara, came to an end the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> revealed their identity to king VirŒ¢a and in token of his gratefulness he expressed his desire to marry his daughter UttarŒ KumŒr¶ to Arjuna. But Arjuna did not accept the offer. He said–“O king, I have lived long in the inner apartment of your palace and in isolation as well as in public, I have looked upon your daughter as my own. She too has confided in me as father. I have danced before her and know the art of music. So in spite of her love for me she has always looked upon me as her teacher. She is now grown up and I had to remain in her contact for a year. As such I accept her as my daughter-in-law so that you or anybody else should not grow suspicious about either of us.  Only by doing so, will our relations rise above all suspicion. “Everyone was full of praise for the pious sentiments of Arjuna and UttarŒ was married to Abhimanyu. Men like Arjuna alone, exercising self-control can keep themselves unstained and hatch no evil desire at heart even after living in close contact with a young lady.  Grown up boys and teachers for girls are advised to take a lesson from this exemplary behaviour. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">AÜwatthŒmŒ, having murdered the sons of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>, Dh¾¦¢adyumna and others while they were sleeping, went to the bank of the GaÆgŒ and sat there. Afterwards on hearing about the heinous crime committed by AÜwatthŒmŒ, Bh¶masena and Arjuna went out in search of him in order to avenge on him. Seeing Bh¶ma and Arjuna approaching, AÜwatthŒmŒ, much frightened and finding no means of escape, launched <span class="char-style-override-5">BrahmŒstra</span>. In no time such fire as breaks out at the times of chaos, blazed forth and began to spread on all sides. In order to extinguish the terrible fire Arjuna also revealed <span class="char-style-override-5">BrahmŒstra,</span> for the evil effects of <span class="char-style-override-5">BrahmŒstra </span>could be done away with the launching of <span class="char-style-override-5">BrahmŒstra</span> alone. When the two missiles collided against each other a terrible noise was produced, thousands of meteors shot out and all people were struck with horror on witnessing the terrible mishap. <span class="char-style-override-5">Devar¦i</span> NŒrada and the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> VyŒsa arrived there simultaneously and tried to pacify both the warriors. As advised by the two great men, Arjuna at once retracted the missile. He had hurled it simply to calm down the missile of AÜwatthŒmŒ. It was the peculiarity with the missile that it was very difficult to withdraw it all at once. Only a celibate could do so. Making due consideration of the arrival of the two great men AÜwatthŒmŒ also tried his best to withdraw it but being unchaste he could not do so. At last as directed by VyŒsaj¶ he directed the missile towards the womb of UttarŒ and as a result a dead child was born to her but Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa restored it to life. Thus in the character of Arjuna we find a strange combination of the two qualities namely valour, knowledge of divine weapons and control over senses.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Arjuna’s life was a divine one. The more we reflect on his character the more exemplary and instructive do we find it.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Kunt¶ Dev¶—An Ideal Lady</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Kunt¶ Dev¶ was an ideal lady. She was the mother of the high-souled <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄdavas</span> and father’s sister of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. She was Vasudeva’s own sister and was given in adoption to king Kuntibhoja. Since her birth people called her P¾thŒ but as she was brought up by king Kuntibhoja, she was popularly known as Kunt¶. Since her childhood she was good-natured, virtuous, self-controlled and a devotee. One day a highly sublime <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> came as a guest to king Kuntibhoja. The task of attending on him was entrusted to maiden Kunt¶. She had great devotion for the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> and took great interest in serving the guests. Shaking off her sloth and ego she devoted herself heart and soul to the service of the revered <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span>. She earned the pleasure of the revered <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> through serving him with a pure heart. The revered BrŒhmaÄa however, behaved in a queer manner. Sometimes he would turn up at an untimely hour and sometimes he did not turn up at all for days together and sometimes he demanded a thing which was hard to find but P¾thŒ would satisfy him by all means as if she had made preparations for the same beforehand. The <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> felt great satisfaction over her amiable nature, virtuous conduct and restrained manners. The service rendered by her to the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> during her childhood proved a benediction to her and it laid the foundation of self-control, virtuous conduct, self-sacrifice and a sense of service in her life. In her later life these qualities developed in her exceptionally.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sentiment of selfless service had developed in Kunt¶  since her childhood. She had spent full one year in serving the high-souled <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> with great dedication and promptness. She had completed the observance of sacred duty of service. The <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> could not scan any fault with her service. As a result he was very happy with her. He said to her­—“My daughter, I am much pleased at your dedicated service. Ask for any boon you desire.” Kunt¶ gave a befitting reply to the revered <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span>. This reply was quite befitting the <span class="char-style-override-5">BµuŒ</span> (father’s sister) of Ýr¶ k¾¦Äa and the would-be mother of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>. Kunt¶ said–“you and father both are happy with me and this much is enough for the fulfilment of all my desires. No more do I stand in need of the bestowal of boons.” The devotion to service with a spirit of unselfishness was indeed an extraordinory combination in a minor girl. The girls of our country ought to take a lesson from the ideal of selfless service of Kunt¶. Hospitality to guests has been the life-breath of our social life and the Indians would receive its training since their very childhood. The sincere and <span class="char-style-override-5">SŒttvika </span>service is one which is rendered cheerfully, without the feeling of burdensome uneasiness and with       no self-interest. Generally these two feelings are absent in services rendered these days. The service rendered cheerfully and without selfish motive becomes the supreme means of one’s spiritual well-being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence when Kunt¶ did not ask for any boon from the<span class="char-style-override-5"> BrŒhmaÄa,</span> the latter insisted her to accept from him the <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantra</span> capable of invoking gods. He had the desire to give Kunt¶ something or the other before his departure. This time she could not spurn the offer thinking that <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> may take her denial as his insult. Then he initiated her into the <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantras</span> occurring in the preliminary section of the <span class="char-style-override-5">AtharvaVeda</span>and said–“Whichever god you will invoke through these <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantras</span> that shall become subservient to you.” Saying these words the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> disappeared then and there. The <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> was none else than DurvŒsŒ the great sage who practised severe penance. Through the occult influence of these <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantras</span> she was blessed with sons like Yudhi¦¢hira, by virtue of the grace of gods like Dharma and others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Kunt¶ was married to king PŒÄÎu. He was a very righteous person. Once he unknowingly killed sage Kindama who was disguised as a deer. This incident aroused in his heart the feeling of great remorse and dispassion. Having renunciated everything he began to dwell in the forest. Kunt¶ was extremely devoted to her husband. Having subdued her senses and giving up sensual enjoyment, she became ready to live in the forest with her husband. She faithfully observed continence till the end of her life and lived a life of self restraint. When her husband left for his celestial abode, she willed to follow her husband leaving her children to the  care of  MŒdr¶ her younger co-wife. But MŒdr¶ opposed it. She said–“I am still quite young hence I shall follow my husband. Instead you should take care of my children.” Kunt¶ agreed to her proposal and till the end of her life paid greater care to her sons than her own. Our mothers and sisters should take lesson from Kunt¶’s life how one’s co-wife and her children should be treated by one. During her husband’s life time she treated MŒdr¶ like her own sister and after she burnt herself alive at the pyre of her husband, she entertained  the same feelings for her children as a pious lady should entertain. She had a great affection for Sahadeva and he too had a deep love for her.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Since the death of Kunt¶dev¶’s husband her life became a tale of continuous troubles. But she was very thoughtful and was endowed with forbearance. So she did not at all mind the troubles and did not deviate from the path of righteousness till the end. She patiently endured the atrocities inflicted by Duryodhana. She had a very tender and compassionate heart. She did not at all mind her own trouble but she could not bear to see others in trouble. After safely coming out of the house made of lac, she began to live in a city called EkacakrŒ, during those days the people of the place lived under the stress of a great horror. A demon named BakŒsura lived in the suburb of that city. The inhabitants of the city had to supply a cart load of foodgrain and two she-buffaloes for that demon everyday. The demon devoured the man too who took these things to him. The inhabitants had to do this work by turns. One day it was the turn of that house for sending a man to that demon, in which <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> had taken shelter as beggars. There rose a great hue and cry in the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> family. When Kunt¶ came to know of this fact, her heart was filled with great pity. She reflected thus–It will be a matter of great shame for us if in spite of our presence the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> has to undergo trouble. Besides he had provided us the shelter. We should repay his debt someway or the other. The failure to repay the debt of a benefactor on time, is verily a lapse from righteous conduct. Since we live in his house it is our duty to partake of their trouble. Reflecting that way Kunt¶ went to the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> house. She found <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> sitting with his wife and son. He said to his wife–“You belong to a noble family, are virtuous and mother of your children. I cannot send you to the demon in order to save my life.” Hearing the words of husband the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> wife said–“No, I myself shall go to him.The supreme duty of a wife is to do good to her husband even at the cost of her life. It is a matter of blessedness for a woman to  leave for the other-world prior to her husband. “It is just possible that demon may not kill me, considering as woman is not worth killing. Killing of the man is sure but a woman’s killing is doubtful so send me to him.” Hearing the pathetic conversation between father and mother the daughter said–“Well, according to custom both of you will abandon me one day or the other. Then why, don’t you save yourselves by abandoning me this day. People crave for children so that they might save them from trouble.” Hearing those words the parents began to weep. The daughter too could not help her tears. Seeing all of them weeping the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa’s</span> tiny son spurted out–“My father, my mother and sister, please don’t weep.” Then picking up a straw laughingly he said that he could kill the demon with its help. Then all burst into laughter. Kunt¶ had been seeing and hearing all this, she stepped forward and said–“Sire, you have but one son and one daughter. By the grace of God I have five sons. I shall send one of them to carry the demon’s food to him, don’t you worry. The revered <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> expressed reluctance to the proposal of Kunt¶dev¶. He said–“O revered one, your words behove you but I can’t allow my guest to be killed for my sake.” Then Kunt¶ explained to him that the son she would send to the demon was very powerful, accomplished in <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantras</span> and was puissant. One cannot cause any harm to him.” At this the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄa</span> agreed. Then Kunt¶ deputed Bh¶ma for the job and sent him to the demon. Can any mother knowingly sacrifice in such a way her son who is the part and parcel of her life for other’s sake. Needless it is to say that this ideal sacrifice of Kunt¶ has left a desirable impression all over the world. Hence all must take a lesson from her life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Kunt¶’s devotion to truth was an ideal one. She did not resort to falsehood even while jesting, by mistake if some words escaped her mouth she tried her best to be true to them. Another example of such devotedness and truthfulness would not be available, however persistently though we might turn the pages of history. Having won Draupad¶ in <span class="char-style-override-5">SwayaÅvara</span> when Arjuna and Bh¶ma approached their mother and said–“Mother, we have  got this as alms today.” Without looking at what it was she said–“Let all the five brothers use it together.” When she came to know that they had brought a girl, she became much perplexed. She thought to herself that if she withdrew her words she would be committing a sin of falsehood and if she asked her sons to obey her words, the long established tradition would come to naught. The event of five brothers marrying one lady was unprecedented,  under such circumstances Kunt¶dev¶ could not decide what to do. She became perplexed. At last she asked for the opinion of Yudhi¦¢hira who advised her to stick to the truth. Later on when king Drupada protested against it VedavyŒsaj¶ related to them the story of Draupad¶’s previous birth and explained to them by virtue of the boon granted to her by ÝaÆkaraj¶ all the five brothers would marry the daughter of Drupada. Under the circumstances the daughter of Drupada was ceremoniously married to all the five brothers. Kunt¶dev¶’s dedication to truthfulness gained victory. The words that spurted out of her mouth conformed to what was destined to happen. Such a coincidence is not impossible provided truth is strictly adhered to.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From beginning to the end Kunt¶’s life was remarkable for self-denial, austerities and detachedness. During the period of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>’ banishment and even living incognito she lived separately at HastinŒpura and from there she sent to her sons message of strictly adhering to the duties pertaining to the <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriyas</span> through her nephew Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Quoting  the example of VidulŒ and SaÛjaya, she sent to them heart-touching words—“My sons, the occasion for which a <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atrŒÄ¶</span> gives birth to her sons has cropped up. Do not put to shame the milk that you suckled from my breast.” Even during the period of <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> war she stayed there and after the end of the war when Yudhi¦¢hira, the pious one, was enthroned and she was blessed with the status of mother queen <span class="char-style-override-5">(RŒjamŒtŒ)</span> she took upon herself the duty of serving her husband’s brother and his wife who were bereaved of their sons and ridding herself of malice and arrogance, began to spend her time attending on them. Moreover, when they proceeded towards the forest with the consent of Yudhi¦¢hira, she silently followed them. In spite of all persuasions made by Yudhi¦¢hira and others she did not deviate from her firm determination. After a life time period of troubles and miseries when the days of happiness dawned on her, it was the work of a pious lady like Kunt¶ to deny herself the worldly enjoyments and to accept for herself at her own free will the life of renunciation, austerities and service. The example of making such sacrifice for the same brother of her husband and his wife from whom she got nothing but troubles, insult and atrocities for herself, her sons and their wives, is hard to find in the world. Our mothers and sisters should take lesson from the matchless spirit of sacrifice of Kunt¶dev¶.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">While Kunt¶dev¶ was proceeding towards the forest, Bh¶masena tried to bring home to her saying–“Mother, if this was to be done by you why did you make us indulge in such an orgy of bloodshed? Why did you bring us to the city after the death of our father who was a forest dweller?” What Kunt¶dev¶ said in reply at the time is worth being borne in mind. She said—“Dear son, I inspired you to fight simply that you might not sit idly in a cowardly manner, might not lead despicable life by giving up the ultimate goal befitting the K¦atriyas and that you may not be deprived, for ever, of your just rights; I did not do so for the sake of my own happiness. I do not cherish the desire for enjoying kingly life. Now through practising austerities, I want to attain the realms attained by my husband. So attending on my husband’s brother and his wife I mean to spend the rest of my life observing austerities. You should return home cheerfully and perseveringly looking after the comforts of your subjects, try to provide happiness to the members of your family.” Thus consoling her sons Kunt¶dev¶ sallied for the forest in the company of her husband’s brother and his wife living with them in their service till the end of their life and finally gave up her mortal frame like Yog¶s by entering into the forest-fire with them. Ideal ladies like Kunt¶dev¶ are rarely to be found in the history of the world.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Dev¶ Draupad¶</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dev¶ Draupad¶ was the daughter of Drupada, the king of PŒÛcŒla, but she was not born of a womb. She emanated as it were, from a sacrificial altar. She possessed unparalleled charm and grace. No contemporary woman upon the earth possessed such charm as she, such fragrance as is wafted by freshly blooming lotuses, exhaled from her body and spread about two miles around her. At the time of her birth there was an oracle–“This gem among the ladies has taken birth for the fulfilment of gods’ plan and extirpating the K¦atriyas from the face of the earth. She will be the cause of a great terror to the Kauravas.” Dark complexioned as she was people called her K¾¦ÄŒ (having dark coloured skin). By virtue of the boon granted to her in her previous birth, She had five husbands in the present birth. In spite of the fact that she was won by Arjuna alone at the SwayaÅvara, all the five brothers wedded her according to the behest of Kunt¶.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Draupad¶ was ardently devoted to the Lord and supremely faithful to her husbands. She had unflinching love for the revered feet of Lord K¾¦Äa. She considered Him not only as a saviour, well-wisher and claimed Him to be her supreme kinsman but also had profound faith in His omnipotence and omnipresence. In the assembly of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> when Du¬ÜŒsana tried to strip her off her clothes in order to derobe her and none of the courtiers dared oppose the inhuman atrocity, she finding no way out to save herself piteously cried for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa’s help thus–</p>
<p class="Shlok">गोविन्द द्वारकावासिन् कृष्ण गोपीजनप्रिय॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">कौरवै: परिभूतां मां किं न जानासि केशव।</p>
<p class="Shlok">हे नाथ हे रमानाथ व्रजनाथार्त्तिनाशन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कौरवार्णवमग्नां मामुद्धरस्व जनार्दन॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">कृष्ण कृष्ण महायोगिन् विश्वात्मन् विश्वभावन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रपन्नां पाहि गोविन्द कुरुमध्येऽवसीदतीम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata, SabhŒ</span>. 68. 41–43)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O Govind, who dwelleth in DwŒrakŒ, O K¾¦Äa, the beloved of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gop¶s,</span> O KeÜava, are you not aware of the fact that I am being humiliated by the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O universal Lord, the consort of RamŒ,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O saviour of Vraja and destroyer of all suffering,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Lord creator of the universe,</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O JanŒrdana, save me from flaundering in the ocean of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas’</span> tyranny.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">O Govinda, save me who have taken refuge in you and who has fallen into the clutches of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas.</span>”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord listens to the piteous outcry of a sincere heart without any delay. At that time Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was staying at DwŒrakŒ. From there He rushed upto her andhiding Himself in the form of Dharma in her garments saved her modesty. By the grace of God the length of Draupad¶’s saree increased times without number. The more Du¬ÜŒsana pulled at it, the longer it grew. In no time a heap of clothes was visible there. The mighty arms of the most powerful Du¬ÜŒsana lost their vigour but the other end of the saree was not yet accessible. All who were present in the assembly witnessed this miraculousoutcome of devotion to the Lord and feminine Chastity. At last Du¬ÜŒsana defeatedly and shamefacedly sat down. The Lord who is ever well-disposed to His devotees saved the modesty of His devotee. Hail to such favourableness to the devotees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While the PŒÄÎavas along with Draupad¶ were staying in the forest called <span class="char-style-override-5">KŒmyaka,</span> one day it so happened that at the instance of Duryodhana the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> DurvŒsŒ accompanied by a host of his disciples numbering ten thousand approached the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>. On purpose did Duryodhana send him to them, when having finished their meals all of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were relaxing themselves. For the purpose of entertaining the guests properly, king Yudhi¦¢hira had obtained through solicitation of sun-god, such a magic pot that even scanty food cooked in it became inexhaustible. But the condition was that this magic power could remain effective only so long as Draupad¶ would not finish her meals. Yudhi¦¢hira invited him to a dinner along with the host of his disciples. Subsequently DurvŒsŒj¶ accompanied by all went to the bank of the GaÆgŒ for bathing and performing other daily rituals.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When DurvŒsŒj¶ went about a host of ten thousand disciples followed him and it seemed as if a whole university escorted him. All of them had of course been invited by DharmarŒja to have their meals and the ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i</span> had expressed his consent but nobody took notice of the fact that Draupad¶ had already finished her meal and so food could not be provided to them even through the effect of the pot provided by sun-god, Draupad¶ was greatly worried. She thought to herself that if the <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> returns unfed, he won’t refrain from invoking a curse. He was known throughout the world for his wrathful nature. When Draupad¶ was unable to find a solution she remembered Lord K¾¦Äa who relieves His devotees from all fears, from the core of her heart and in order to relieve her from the present crisis prayed Him thus–</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“O K¾¦Äa, O large armed Sr¶ K¾¦Äa, O son of Devak¶, O imperishable Lord, O remover of troubles of the grief- stricken people who lie prostrate at your revered feet, O Lord of the universe, You alone are the Supreme Soul pervading the entire universe. The creation and dissolution of the universe is but a playful act of your hand. O God, you are indestructible. O GopŒla, the protector of those taking refuge in you. You are the saviour of the entire created beings—the most transcendental, Supreme Being. You are the motive force behind all mental propensities and the blissful state of the spirit. I make obeisance to Thee. O Infinite, worthy of adoration of all and bestower of boons, hasten to save those helpless devotees who are unable to find anyone but You to help them. O Eternal Being, the propensities of mind and vital powers miserably fail to make access to You. O Supreme Being, the passive witness of all, I surrender myself to you. O Lord!You who are favourably disposed to those taking refuge in you, be kind to save me from harm. O dark complexioned Lord, having bodily complexion like that of blue lotuses and eyes slightly reddish like the core of lotuses. O K¾¦Äa adorned with gem called Kaustubha and apparelled in yellow garment, you are the most transcendental, effulgent, all pervading and the Over-soul. Men endowed with knowledge call You alone the eternal seed of the entire creation and the perennial source of all the divine attributes. So long as you are there to protect me there can be no cause of fear even if all the calamities befall me. Just as you saved me on a previous occasion in the assembly from the clutches of Du¬ÜŒsana so also be kind enough now to help us out of the present predicament.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The innerself of everyone verily stands revealed to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He arrived there without any loss of time. It seemed as if Draupad¶ was vivified at the sight of Him—as if a drowning man had caught at a straw. Draupad¶ summarily related to Him the whole matter. Displaying His impatience Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa said–“We shall talk about other matters afterwards. First let me have something to eat. I am extremely hungry. You can hardly imagine what a long distance I had to cover in arriving here and how desperately exhausted I am.” Draupad¶ was mortified with shame. She stammered out–“My Lord, I have just finished my meal. Little is left in that cooking pot now.” “Let me atleast have a glance at the cooking pot” said Ýr¶ k¾¦Äa. K¾¦ÄŒ (Draupad¶) brought out the pot. When Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa took up the pot and examined it, he found a piece of leafy vegetable sticking at its neck. Putting the same into His mouth He said–“Let the Lord of the entire universe and the enjoyer of offerings made at the sacrificial altar be appeased with this piece of leafy vegetable. Subsequently he said to Sahadeva–“Brother, now go to fetch the respectable sages to have their dinner. When Sahadeva reached the bank of the river GaÆgŒ he found none of them there. What had exactly happened was that while Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was putting the leafy vegetable into His mouth and pronouncing His resolve, the great sages standing in the water were sanctifying themselves. All of a sudden such a feeling arose in their mind that their bellies were full upto the neck with victual. They looked at each other as if to ask–“What can we possibly eat there at the cottage of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas?</span> DurvŒsŒ saw wisdom in escaping away from there unnoticed for he knew it well that the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were devoted to God and ever since the untoward happenings that took place at the house of Ambar¶¦a he had begun to entertain great fright for the Lord’s devotees. Eventually all of them fled away from there. Sahadeva received the information of their escapade from the ascetics who dwelt there and after returning from there he narrated the matter to DharmarŒja. Thus through Draupad¶’s devotion to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, an imminent danger to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> was averted. Through His arrival Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa saved them from the wrath of DurvŒsŒ and thus he displayed His affectionateness to  those who make self surrender to Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa along with SatyabhŒmŒ, the revered lady,  paid a visit to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in the forest. During her conversation with Draupad¶ SatyabhŒmŒ said to her–“Sister, I dare ask you a question. I find that your gallant and mighty husbands are always reconciled to you. What is the reason behind it? Are you in the know of some magic formula or medicine or have you won over their hearts through <span class="char-style-override-5">Japa,</span> penance, fasting, your learning, through offering oblations to the fire? Could you suggest some device to me as well through which I can win over the heart of ÝyŒmasundara? Draupad¶, the revered lady, said–“Sister, I wonder why in spite of being the chief queen and beloved wife of ÝyŒmasundara, you speak like that. The ladies who are pious and exclusively devoted to their husbands refrain from such magic formulae in the same way as one keeps away from snakes and scorpions. Can one’s husband be ever subjugated through  magic formulae? Only the ignorant and wretch ladies resort to such methods in order to entice their husbands. By doing so they not only harm themselves but also harm their husbands. One should always keep oneself aloof from such women.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Subsequently she explained to her how she conducted herself in order to seek the pleasure of her husbands. Giving up the sense of self-esteem, lust and anger I with due care render service to all the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> and the womenfolk of their family. I guard myself against spite and keeping my mind under control I surrender myself to the will of my husbands only with a view to serve them. I refrain from using bitter words. I do not stand in an uncivil manner. I do not cast a glance at evil things nor do I ever sit at an undesirable place, avoid the least nearness to those having evil character. But for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> I cherish for none else—be he a celestial being, a man, a demigod, young, affluent or handsome. I take food only after feeding my husbands, take bath only after they have taken theirs and sit down only after they take their seats. Whenever my husbands return home I stand up to show my respect and offer them seat and water. I scour and clean well all the utensils, prepare sweet dishes, offer meals on time and remain active all the time. I pay heed to the preservation of grains in the house and keep my house clean by sweeping and dusting it. I do not scorn at anyone during conversation with him and avoid the least contact with women of undesirable character and shaking off sloth ever try to conduct myself in a way pleasing to my husbands. I avoid frequently standing at the gate nor do I stay longer at an open place or a place where rubbish is heaped. I always practise truthfulness in speech and devote myself to the service of my husbands. I don’t like at all to live all alone without my husband. When my husband stays away from home on account of some domestic piece of work I stop the use of flowers and sandal-paste and spend my time in observing religious rites and keeping fast. I abstain from using such things as are not eaten, drunk or used by my husbands. I totally observe the injunctions of the scriptures prescribed for the ladies. I always try to bedeck myself with the clothes and cosmetics that are available and take precaution only to do that which is agreeable to my husbands.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I observe each and every household duty instructed to  me by my revered mother-in-law. I virtually observe with due care day and night all the duties prescribed for me relating to the giving away of charities, offering worship and oblations to the manes, preparing of sweet dishes on festive occasions and the extending of warm welcome to the respectable persons etc. At all times I adhere to modest behaviour and regulated life. In my opinion the perpetual duty of women is only to remain under the control of their husbands for they are verily their deities. I never cherish a life better than those of my husbands, never eat better food, never put on better clothes and ornaments than those worn by my husbands, never enter into conflict with my revered mother-in-lawandever exercise self-control. I, as a rule, get up earlier than my husbands and remain dedicated to the service of my elders. I regularly serve my mother-in-law by providing her food, water and clothes. In respect of garments, ornaments and food etc., I never aspire for anything special and different from my mother-in-law. Formerly king Yudhi¦¢hira had as many maid servants as ten thousand and I literally knew their names, features and clothes etc., and I also took due notice of what they  did and what they did not. At the time when staying at Indraprastha king Yudhi¦¢hira carried on his administrative work, one lakh horses and equal number of elephants rode behind him. The work of counting them and the managing of their affairs was conducted by none else but me and it was I who had to pay heed to their requirements. Again it was I who looked after the work of all the servants including the milkmen and shepherds employed in the inner apartment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I unassisted by anyone else would maintain the accounts of the king’s income, expenditure and savings. Shifting the entire household duties on my shoulders, the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> dedicated themselves to the offering of worship and greeting those who visited the house or departed from it. And I having given up all comforts looked after them. I alone knew about the inexhaustible treasure that belonged to them. Undergoing the pain of hunger and thirst I dedicated myself day and night to the service of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span> Those days, days and nights had lost their distinction for me. I would be the first to rise and the last to go to bed. O SatyabhŒmŒ, this is the method I know of, for seeking conciliation with one’s husband. We should take a lesson from the life of Draupad¶ as to how an ideal house-wife should conduct herself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Wonderful latending of effulgence befitting character of Dev¶ Draupad¶. She was very intelligent and endowed with learning. Extraordinary was her sense of selfless sacrifice. Her supreme dedication to her husbands was acknowledged by one and all. Catching hold of her hair when wicked Du¬ÜŒsana dragged her to the assembly hall, she tried to intimidate him by saying that he would become the subject of her husband’s wrath, rebuked the courtiers and admonished the respectable elderly persons like DroÄa, Bh¶¦ma and Vidura for remaining passive onlookers. She incited them and appealed to them in the name of justice and asked them in the name of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> if king Yudhi¦¢hira had any right to put her at stake after he had lost his own self at the stake. All the courtiers were rendered speechless. None dared answer Draupad¶’s question. At last rose VikarÄa, the brother of Duryodhana, from his seat and made an appeal to everyone to answer Draupad¶’s question and entreated them to break silence. He expressed his own view- point saying that firstly, Draupad¶ was verily the wife of all the five brothers, hence Yudhi¦¢hira had not the sole right to put Draupad¶ at stake. Secondly, he put Draupad¶ at stake after he had lost his own self at the stake and therefore, it should be regarded as an improper action done by him. On hearing the view-point of VikarÄa, Vidura seconded it and some other courtiers praised him. But KarÄa rebuked him and made him sit down. In spite of being humiliated and dragged in such a way to the assembly hall packed to the capacity Draupad¶ did gain a moral victory. Her wit was predominant. Nobody dared oppose her views. At last at the suggestion of Vidura, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra scolded Duryodhana and in order to please her inspired Draupad¶ to ask for a boon. Draupad¶ merely expressed the desire that her five husbands should be freed from slavery. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra lovingly insisted her to ask for  something more. Whatever Draupad¶ said in reply at that time was entirely befitting a woman like Draupad¶ alone. What she said clearly shows  her greedlessness and love of duty <span class="char-style-override-5">(Dharma)</span>. She said, Sire, it is not proper to entertain much greed. Besides, I don’t crave at all for anything else. My husbands themselves are capable enough. Now as they stand free from servility they will be in a position to manage everything themselves. Thus through her wit and chastity she could be able to secure freedom for her husbands from servility.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Draupad¶ could never quite dismiss from her mind the fact that she was dragged to the assembly hall crowded with people by wicked Du¬ÜŒsana by her same long and black hair which had of late been drenched with holy water sanctified through the recitation of <span class="char-style-override-5">Mantras.</span> The fire of that unprecedented humiliation kept burning at her heart all the time. That was why whenever the proposal for making peace with the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> came to her knowledge, she did nothing but oppose it and ever reminding them of the humiliation meted out to her by the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> inspired her husbands to fight. At last when it was finally decided ultimately to make an effort to bring the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> round and consequently when Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was ready to proceed  towards HastinŒpura with peace proposal from the side of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> even at that moment she could not dismiss from her mind the incident and taking her long hair into her hand she said to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa—“O Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, it is good that you are going there for a peace accord. But do not fail to keep in view my hair.” She went on to say–“It matters little if the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> do not cherish the desire to fight; my old father accompanied by his gallant sons shall combat with the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and my five sons including Abhimanyu shall wage war against them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">In the KŒmyaka forest when Jayadratha was trying to take Draupad¶ away by force, she pushed him so hard that he fell down on the ground like a cut down tree. But instantly he stood erect and forcibly dragging her into the chariot started from there. Later on, when Bh¶ma and Arjuna seized and brought him home and thrashed him soundly she, out of mercy, made him set at liberty. Thus we see that Draupad¶ not only became cross but also possessed a sense of forgiveness. The sublimity of her chaste life was unique. Whoever tried to molest or seduce her was deprived of his life. Duryodhana, Du¬ÜŒsana, KarÄa, Jayadratha, K¶caka and others had to meet such a fate. Who should not be doomed by the heart-rending shrieks of a chaste woman undergoing tortures? The root cause of the extermination of the Kauravas in the battle of MahŒbhŒrata was undoubtedly the humiliation of Draupad¶ who was faithfully devoted to her husbands. <span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">GŒndhŒr¶—Paragon of Chastity</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">GŒndhŒr¶ occupies a high place among the chaste ladies of the world. She was the daughter of Subala, the king of GŒndhŒra and sister of Ýakuni. When she was yet a virgin she obtained through inordinate adoration of Lord ÝaÆkara the boon of having one hundred sons. Ever since she came to know that she was going to be married to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra who was blind she bandaged both of her eyes. She thought to herself that since her husband was not blessed with eyesight she could not arrogate to herself the right of enjoying the sights of the world. From that day till the very end of her life she stuck to her firm resolve. Such an example of denying oneself sense enjoyments for the  sake of husband can hardly be found in the history of the world. Such a self-denial and dispassion of her was marvellous  and something rare for the world. She was always submissive to her husband. Soon after coming to her father-in-law’s house through her character and virtues she cast a spell on her husband and all the members of his family. Blessed be one’s love for one’s husband.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">GŒndhŒr¶, the revered lady, was as intrepid and justice-loving as she was exclusively devoted to her husband. She always stood for truth, ethical values and <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and would never side with injustice. She entertained in her heart much grief for the ill-treatment accorded to Draupad¶ by her own sons in the crowded assembly hall. She was not happy with her sons over the matter. She became much grieved when her husband, king Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra induced by his sons summoned the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> for the second time to play the game of dice protesting against gambling she said to her revered husband—My Lord, no sooner did Duryodhana see the light of the day than he started crying and howling like a jackal that was why profoundly learned Viduraj¶ had instantaneously suggested to give up such a son. Whenever I am reminded of that prediction I assume he shall prove himself to be the cause of the extirpation of the lineage of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kurus</span>. Therefore, my most respected husband, do not hurl others into misfortunes on account of your own fault. Do not say ditto to what these impudent stupid people say. Do not make yourself the cause of the utter destruction of this lineage of ours. Do not pull down a bridge which is intact. The fire that lies extinguished shall blaze up again. The <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> are calm and are free from malice and animosity. It won’t be proper to arouse their anger at this moment. Aware though you are of all these things, I take an opportunity to remind you. An ill-witted person remains unaffected by the injunctions of the scriptures. It is improper that in spite of your old age you behave like a child. At present you must not disown the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> who are sons to you. Take care that being aggrieved they may not seek separation from you. It is but proper to abandon Duryodhana who is a slur upon the family. This is the evil consequence of disregarding due to infatuation the advice given at that time by Viduraj¶. Keep your reasoning power alive through unperturbedness, righteousness and by acting upon the wholesome advice of your ministers. Abstain from the negligence of duty. Acting without forethoughts will prove to be of great trouble to you. Kingly prosperity possessed by a wretch person causes his doom. These words of GŒndhŒr¶ abundantly reflect her righteousness, moral values and impartiality. She would caution Duryodhana against his evil doings and rebuke him for his overbearance and draw before him horrible pictures of terrible future consequences of his immoral activities. But his doom was looming large over his head which would not let him heed these salutary advices aiming at his own well-being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Lord K¾¦Äa himself arrived at HastinŒpura as the envoy of <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas </span>and he too failed in His attempt to persuade Duryodhana, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra called GŒndhŒr¶ to his presence and said to her—“Now it is time for you to bring your son round. He pays heed to none of us.” Hearing these words GŒndhŒr¶ said—“O King, you are overwhelmed by infatuation for your son. So (in this regard) you are to be held mainly responsible for the fault. Knowing the fact that Duryodhana is a great sinner, you have hitherto been guided by his wits. Duryodhana is fully enmeshed by lust, anger and greed. You will not be able to even by the use of force, keep himself away from this path. Without considering the pros and cons you handed over the reigns of administration of the state in the hands of your son who is villaineous, ignorant, ill-companioned and greedy and now you are experiencing its evil consequences. You have constantly been ignoring the rift that is cropping up in your own family. By such an act of yours, you are making yourself ridiculous in the eyes of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>. Will any wise man ever resort to punishment to his own kith and kin in case a catastrophe could be averted through persuasion and allurement?” How frank, unbiased, beneficient, moral, ethical and sincere this assertion of GŒndhŒr¶ was!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After that she called for her son and started exhorting him. She spoke thus—“Dear son, listen to what I say. Act upon the advice given to you by your father, Bh¶¦maj¶, DroÄŒcŒrya, K¾pŒcŒrya and Viduraj¶. If you settle your dispute with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>, take it for granted, that you will hereby render a great service to the grand father Bh¶¦ma, your father, me and all your well-wishers such as DroÄŒcŒrya and others as well. The attaining of kingship, safeguarding it and the enjoying of kingly glory—all are beyond human control. Only the man who has control over his senses can defend his kingdom. Lust and greed undoubtedly deprive one of one’s wealth. The entire world can be conquered through the conquest of these two enemies. Just as an uncontrollable horse causes the death of his unwise charioteer on the way, so also the unsubdued senses are cause enough for bringing about the doom of a human being. Thus prosperity stays  longer with one who exercises control over his senses and who undertakes all of his activities after fore- thought. Dear son, whatever advice has been given to you by grand father Bh¶¦ma and your preceptor DroÄŒcŒrya is quite sound. In fact Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna cannot be overcome by anybody. So you are advised to take refuge in Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and His pleasure will ensure the well-being of both sides. Dear child, battling does not ensure one’s well-being since it does not secure <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> or material prosperity; it can’t provide us happiness. If you as well as ministers want to enjoy the happiness of kingship you must give the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> their due share. The act of banishing the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> for thirteen years is another big crime done to them. Now alleviate the crime by making peace with them. O dear one, in this world none can become wealthy through greed. So give up your greed and settle the matter with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span>. How wholesome and heart-touching exhortation it was! It reveals the fact that GŒndhŒr¶ was endowed with learning and she also knew the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These noble teachings of GŒndhŒr¶ had little effect on wicked Duryodhana. He did not give up his obstinacy. The result was that preparations for war began on both sides and killing and fighting took place in the battlefield of Kuruk¦etra continuously for eighteen days. During the period of war Duryodhana would pray her everyday saying—“Mother, I am going to have a terse fight with my enemies. Be good enough to bless me so that I may become victorious. GŒndhŒr¶ possessed the sublimity of the lady who looks upon her husband as her deity and if she at all blessed her son her words would not have become futile. But how could she dare bless him? She knew well that Duryodhana was an oppressor and kingly glory can never stay with a tyrant. That was why everytime he approached her she would repeat these words—My son, where there is <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> there is victory. If you desire to become victorious do resort to <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and refrain from what is unrighteous.” She never nursed any partiality for Duryodhana. But when the news came to her ears that all of her hundred sons were killed, her overwhelming grief aroused her wrath and she intended to invoke curse on the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span> Lord VedavyŒsa could verily know what was at other’s heart. When VedavyŒsa came to know about her intention he approached her and offered her consolation and restrained her from her evil desire. The <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> too were present there at the time. Sensing the disgust at her heart Yudhi¦¢hira approached her and reproaching his own self the moment he tried to fall at her feet, GŒndhŒr¶’s wrathful glance penetrated through the bandage and fell on the nails of king Yudhi¦¢hira. It caused at once his lovely reddish nails turn black. Noticing this his brothers too began to hide themselves here and there out of fright. Noticing them in such a hesitant mood, GŒndhŒr¶’s temper cooled down and she consoled the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> like a mother. The above mentioned incident reveals to us the matchless sublimity GŒndhŒr¶ was endowed with by virtue of her single-minded devotion to her husband. Finally Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa had to become the victim of her wrath. To put it in other words, it was none else but indweller Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa who saved the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> from her wrath by changing her mind and making Himself the object of her fury and curse. When revered GŒndhŒr¶ went to Kuruk¦etra and looked at the heart rending scenes of the battlefield she could not help control her sorrow. She became wrathful and spoke to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa thus­—“O K¾¦Äa, the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> and the Kauravas have surely been doomed on account of their hostility. But how it is that in spite of your capabilities you did not care for the interest of your kith and kin. You had a number of servants and a large army as well. You could, if you  would prevail on both of them and could bring them round through your skill of speech but knowingly you did not mind the destruction of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas.</span> So you must now bear the consequence of your neglect. On the score of merits that I have earned through the service of my husband, I hereby curse you that as you wilfully neglected the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> fighting with one another so also you shall be responsible for the killing of your own kith and kin and you yourself shall be killed with none nearby to protect you. Just as these ladies belonging to the race of Bharata are piteously lamenting so also shall the ladies of your family weep and wail the death of their friends and relatives.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing these harsh words of GŒndhŒr¶ large-hearted Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa smiled and said—“I was aware of the fact that things would take such a course. By invoking the curse you have simply foretold what was already destined to happen. Undoubtedly the extermination of <span class="char-style-override-5">V¾¦Äi</span> race will take place on account of divine wrath. Its extermination will be caused by none else but me. Far less to speak of men even the gods and the demons are not capable of bringing about its extermination. So the men belonging to the <span class="char-style-override-5">Yadu</span>-race shall cause their own destruction through mutual conflicts.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">After the coronation of Yudhi¦¢hira the revered GŒndhŒr¶ stayed with him for some time but subsequently went to the forest in order to live with her husband and having lived there the life of an ascetic, and like ascetics burnt herself alive along with her husband in the forest-fire and attained the realms of Kubera along with her husband. Thus GŒndhŒr¶ who was exclusively devoted to her husband having served her husband in the world, got an opportunity to live in close proximity to and served her husband which is the ultimate object of a lady exclusively devoted to her husband. Every lady exclusively devoted to her husband should reflect on the character of GŒndhŒr¶ and should take lesson from it.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Viduraj¶—A Great Soul</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viduraj¶, a great soul, was the very incarnation of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma.</span> Due to the curse of ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i </span>MŒÄÎavya he had to take birth as a <span class="char-style-override-5">Ýµudra</span> (in a low caste family). He was born of the maid servant of king Vicitrav¶rya. Thus he could be reckoned in one way as the real brother of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and PŒÄÎu. He was very intelligent, virtuous, versed in moral and religious duties and was a scholar and devotee. On account of these qualities he commanded a great respect among people. He was very frank and fearless and offered good advice to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and others. As it was, he was the minister of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra. Soon after his birth Duryodhana had started braying. There were many ill omens predicting impending catastrophes. Noting all these things he as well as some other Brahmans said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘‘</span>This son of yours shall be the cause of the ruination of your own family. Hence it would be proper to abandon him. If he remains alive you will have to suffer. The scriptures have ordained that for the sake of a family, a person, for the sake of a village, a family, for the sake of the country, a village and for the sake of one’s soul the entire earth should  be abandoned.” But out of infatuation for his son he did not act upon the advice of Viduraj¶. As a consequence he had to suffer throughout his life on account of Duryodhana and had to see the ruination of his own race during his very life. One who is not mindful of salutary advice of great souls has to suffer misery.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Duryodhana began to torment the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> naturally Vidura’s sympathies went in favour of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas;</span> firstly because they were fatherless and secondly because they were righteous persons. Directly and indirectly he helped and offered them protection. A pious soul has natural sympathies for the righteous people and Vidura was righteousness incarnate. He knew that in spite of all the calamities the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> will come out victorious in the end (wherever is righteousness, there is victory). He also knew that the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were blessed with a long life and as such they could not be killed by anyone. So when in a crafty move, Duryodhana made Bh¶masena take poisonous food and hurled him into the water of GaÆgŒ, and on not returning of Bh¶masena, his mother Kunt¶ not only became worried but anticipated an untoward happening through Duryodhana. Viduraj¶ came to Kunt¶ and advised her thus—“It would be proper to keep silence at present, suspecting Duryodhana in this matter may entail danger. He will rather get more irritated by this and it may invite troubles to your other sons also. Bh¶masena cannot die. He will come back soon. Kunt¶ accepted his prudent advice. His words proved true, for after a few days Bh¶ma did return hale and hearty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was Viduraj¶ who had told the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> the device of escaping unharmed from the house made of lac. Besides being versed in ethics he was a linguist too. When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were going to VaraÄŒvat, he informed them of the impending danger by sending to Yudhi¦¢hira a note written in a dialect known to <span class="char-style-override-5">Malecchas</span> and also hinted to them how they could escape. Besides this he had deputed beforehand a man to dig a tunnel for escaping from the house made of lac and the man built an underground  passage leading to the forest. Setting fire to the house made of lac the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> along with their mother Kunt¶ came out unharmed through that passage. In order to take them across the GaÆgŒ Viduraj¶ had already deputed a sailor with a boat, with the help of that boat they went across the river GaÆgŒ. Viduraj¶ saved the lives of <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> through his wits and tactful device and also took precaution to keep it a secret from Duryodhana and others. Duryodhana thought that the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> with their mother Kunt¶ must have been reduced to ashes. Physical power and the power of weapons alone do not serve our purpose in every situation. Prudence is also necessary for self protection. Vidura, a great soul, had not only a profound knowledge of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and the scriptures but was the treasure-house of ethics also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as Vidura had sympathy and love for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> so also he had affection and tender feelings for his elder brother Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and his sons. He always looked after their interest and would offer them good counsel <span class="char-style-override-6">‘हितं मनोहारि च दुर्लभं वच:’</span> rare are such words as are salutery and as well as pleasant—according to this maxim, in spite of being veracious and wholesome whatever Viduraj¶ said seemed to be bitter to Duryodhana and others. Duryodhana and his associates were always dissatisfied with him. But without caring a fig for their displeasure he always solicited their welfare and made unwearied effort to divert Duryodhana from evil ways. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra although dominated as he was by his evil-minded son, could not always act upon Vidura’s advice and consequently had to suffer, still he trusted him much. He considered him as intelligent, far-sighted and his best well-wisher and generally he would not be undertaking any work without consulting him. In matters concerning the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> especially he did not fail to consult him for he knew that in regard to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> his opinion will be unbiased.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When evil minded Duryodhana, instigated by his maternal uncle, Ýakuni, approached his father Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra with the proposal for gambling with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> he called Viduraj¶ as usual for taking his advice in the matter. When his father did not accede to his request he tried to intimidate him on the pretext of giving up his life but he firmly told him that without seeking the advice of Viduraj¶ he could not allow him to gamble. Hearing of the sinful proposal of Duryodhana, Viduraj¶ felt that <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaliyuga</span> was fast approaching. He bluntly opposed the proposal and explained to his elder brother thus—“By gambling the feeling of malice and antagonism will grow between your sons and your nephews and neither of the two will be benefited. So it will not be proper to arrange for gambling. Their welfare lies in not having a gambling. Admiring Viduraj¶ and also his sound opinion Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra tried his best to induce Duryodhana but he was not prepared to yield at all. He was bent upon slighting the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> by defeating them in gambling. He was unable to bear their illimitable prosperity. When Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra felt that Duryodhana was not going to yield any way he consented to his proposal and sent none else than Viduraj¶ to call for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> from Indraprastha. Though Viduraj¶ took ill of it, he however did not deem it proper to disobey his elder brother.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On approaching the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> Viduraj¶ told them the whole story. Knowing that gambling was undesirable, Yudhi¦¢hira, in obedience to his father Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, accepted the proposal of Duryodhana. Even while the gambling was on enumerating the evils of gambling Viduraj¶ said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra—“Be cautious even now. Avoid saying ditto to whatever Duryodhana says and save your race from destruction. Do not make the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> turn hostile by being malicious to them.” When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> had gone to the forest Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra became anxious and felt a burning sensation in his heart. He called in Vidura and poured out to him the feelings at his heart and desired to know from him as to how he should conduct himself to ensure the contentment of his subjects and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> may not get angry thus cause no harm to us. At this Viduraj¶ explained to him thus—“O king, riches, <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and sensual enjoyments—all these goals of life are achieved through <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> alone. <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> is the foundation of kingdoms, so establishing yourself in <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> you should safeguard the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> as well as your sons. Ill-advised by Ýakuni, your sons have brought <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> to ridicule in the assembly packed to the capacity. It is quite immoral as they have perfidiously defeated the truthful Yudhi¦¢hira in gambling and usurped his all. In my opinion it can be atoned in one way only through which your son can get deliverance from sin and censure and gain prestige. The way is that whatever has been usurped from the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> should be restored to them forthwith. An emperor ought to be contented with his own ends, he must not aspire for usurping others’ rights’ The method I have advised you to follow will remove the blemish on you, discordance among brothers will cease to grow and there will not be violation of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> (duties). If your sons have the least merit to their credit, this work must be finished the sooner it is possible. If out of fondness you shirk from doing so, the whole of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kuru-race</span> will be doomed. If your son Duryodhana readily agrees to it then it is well and good otherwise putting malevolent Duryodhana who is a blot on the fair name of the family, into prison, enthrone Yudhi¦¢hira in his place for the good of your family and the people. Yudhi¦¢hira has neither attachment nor spite for anyone, so he should rule in righteous manner. Du¬ÜŒsana should ask for forgiveness from Bh¶masena and Draupad¶ before the whole assembly. Needless it is to say more, you will attain blessedness by doing so.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This counsel of Viduraj¶ was sound, wholesome and was full of righteousness and intrepidity. But just as a man on the verge of death finds it irksome to take medicines so also Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra did not approve of the counsel of Viduraj¶. He got irritated with him and said—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘‘</span>Vidura, no more I need your services. You may stay here or go away at your will. Time and again I here found you showing your partiality for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span> How can I abandon my sons for their sake?” Viduraj¶ now felt that the destruction of the Kuru race was inevitable, so without any demur he left the place and sitting in a chariot went to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in the <span class="char-style-override-5">KŒmyaka</span> forest. On reaching there he told the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> the reason for leaving HastinŒpura and during course of talks he told them something very significant. When Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra  came to know that Viduraj¶ had gone to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas </span>he felt repentant. He thought to himself that benefited by the assistance and the sound advice of Viduraj¶ the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> would grow more powerful, so he lost no time in sending for Viduraj¶ through SaÛjaya. Viduraj¶ was completely free from attachment and malice. He was not the least displeased with Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra just as he had left HastinŒpura by the order of his elder brother so also he returned to him after receiving his orders to that effect. On reaching there he said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra—In my eyes your sons and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> are alike but finding the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> helpless, sympathy and desire for helping them arises in my heart as a matter of course. I bear no malice against your sons,” and such was indeed the state of affairs. Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra also expressed his regret for his indecent behaviour. Now staying with Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, Viduraj¶ began to serve him as usual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra had to spend sleepless nights, then he sent for Viduraj¶ in the night and asked him how he could enjoy the peace of mind. On that occasion Viduraj¶ exhorted Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra regarding <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and moral duties and his beautiful exhortations are included in eight chapters numbering 33 to 40 of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Udyogaparva.</span> This exhortation has its own value, is worth being studied and pondered over.<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* It has been published by us without any abridgement on pages 486 to 509 of the first book of abridged MahŒbhŒrata.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra was not satiated by the exhortations of Viduraj¶, He wanted to hear more of it from his mouth. He (Viduraj¶)   said—“O king, whatever I had to tell you has already been told. Now SanatsujŒta, the son of BrahmŒj¶, who is the eternal ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i</span> will initiate you in the essence of all true knowledge. It is not my privilege to do so for I was born of the womb of a <span class="char-style-override-5">Ýµudra</span> (a woman of low caste). Having said so he presently recalled to his memory SanatsujŒta who without any delay presented himself there. While answering to the querries made by Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra, SanatsujŒta described<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span> at length the aspect of God and the method of Divine vision. Thus Viduraj¶ not only instructed Dh¾tarŒs¢ra on the subjects of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and moral duties but also by making the supreme <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> SanatsujŒta exhort him on the subject of what is called the essence of all true knowledge, cleared the path of his redemption. Whatever efforts were made by Viduraj¶ for Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and his sons all were directed towards their well-being. The very life of great souls is dedicated to the welfare of others. Though Viduraj¶ himself possessed the essence of all true knowledge, having been born a <span class="char-style-override-5">Ýµudra</span> he refrained from exhorting it to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra himself and in this way he maintained the eternal tradition of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and by his own precedent he set before the world an example that however learned a person may be, he must uphold the great traditions of the scriptures.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* The exhortation made by SanatsujŒta have been compiled under the title Sunatsujat¶ya covering six chapters from 41 to 46 of the Udyogaparva. Its translation has been published by us without any abridgement on pages 509 to 520 in the first book of the Concise MahŒbhŒrata published by us.

<p class="TEXT-English">Viduraj¶ was not only a scholar and seer of truth but he was also an exclusive devotee of God. He had unswerving love for the revered feet of the Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa also had a great regard for him. When he went to HastinŒpura as the messenger of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> after meeting with Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and visiting the courtiers he directly went to Viduraj¶’s house to be his guest. Then he met with His aunt (father’s sister) Kunt¶, besides this when he paid a visit to Duryodhana, being his relative he was invited by him (Duryodhana) to take food but he denied it outright and again came to the house of Vidura. Many respectable persons such as Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa, K¾pa, BŒhl¶ka and others turned up there to call on Him and all of them requested him to take food at their houses but Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, showing due regards to them sent them off, and on that day, having fed the <span class="char-style-override-5">BrŒhmaÄas</span> before He dined at Viduraj¶’s house. By this incident one can easily guess that Viduraj¶ had a great love for  Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. The following declaration of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is popular with the people:</p>
<p class="Shlok">पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तदहं भक्त्युपहृतमश्नामि प्रयतात्मन:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> IX. 26)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whoever offers to Me with love a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even water, I appear in person before that disinterested devotee of purified intellect and delightfully partake of that article offered by him with love.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Great preparations for welcome not inspired with love and  the royal pomp and show cannot attract Lord K¾¦Äa but even the coarse and dry food if offered with love is enough to appease Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After taking food Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa even stayed for the night at Vidura’s house. The whole night passed in conversation. In the morning when the daily rituals were gone through Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa went to the assembly of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas.</span> When Duryodhana audaciously intended to make K¾¦Äa captive there and put him in prison, Viduraj¶ unfolded to him the power and greatness of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and told him that He is the manifestation of supremely absolute Lord and warned that if he dared humiliate him, he would cause his own ruin like moths that burn themselves into fire. After that when Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa revealed his Form universal, being stricken with fear everyone shut his eyes, only DroÄŒcŒrya, Bh¶¦ma, Vidura, SaÛjaya and the <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦is</span> who were present there could have that vision for the Lord had bestowed upon them the Divine eye. Soon after withdrawing this marvellous divine play Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa made his way to Upaplavya whence he had come. Viduraj¶ along with other people went upto some distance to see Him off and after taking leave of him returned home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa came back without success in his mission, preparations for war began on both sides. With large armies comprising eighteen <span class="char-style-override-5">Ak¦auhin¶,</span> both sides gathered in the battlefield of Kuruk¦etra, but even that large army was slain like grass cut to pieces in eighteen days. King Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra was stricken with grief as all his hundred sons and his grand sons were slain in the battlefield. At that time expounding the inevitability of death Viduraj¶ told Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra that those who die fighting in the battlefield attain a very blessed state in the other world and as such their death should not be mourned. He further said—“everytime a creature takes birth he establishes contact with different men and after death those relationships vanish away like dreams. In consideration of this fact also it is not wise to mourn for the dead relatives. Moreover all the events of union and bereavement which are the cause of one’s joys and sorrows are the outcome of one’s own good or evil doings and all the creatures must reap the consequences of their good or evil deed.” Then Viduraj¶ threw light on the ephemeral, unsubstantial and changeable nature of the world, the pain one has to undergo at the time of births and deaths, the imprudence of human beings, equality of all in the eyes of death, the importance of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and explained at length how man can get rid of  the worldly sorrows.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">After the coronation of Yudhi¦¢hira, when Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra stayed with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> Viduraj¶ also stayed with Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and discoursed matters pertaining to <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma.</span> When Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and GŒndhŒr¶ decided to leave that place and go to the forest, he too accompanied them. Going there he took vow of practising a severe penance. Denying food to himself he began to live in the solitary forest all by himself. Seldom were people visible in that uninhabited forest. After sometime when Yudhi¦¢hira along with all the members of his family and the army as well, paid a visit to their uncle and aunt and mother Kunt¶, not finding Viduraj¶ there enquired of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra about him. Meanwhile Viduraj¶ was sighted at a short distance. He was wearing long matted hair on his head, was holding a piece of stone in his mouth and was all naked. All over his body stained with dust as it was, veins were visible. Layer of dirt had settled all over his body. Having cast a look at the hermitage he began to return. Yudhi¦¢hira rushed after him in order to meet him, and loudly introducing himself to him by name called him out again and again. On reaching the dense part of the forest, Viduraj¶ stood steadily reclining himself against a tree. Yudhi¦¢hira found Viduraj¶ reduced to a mere skeleton. He could be recognised only with great difficulty. Yudhi¦¢hira went up to him and offered him worship. Having attained the state of trance he looked at Yudhi¦¢hira with unwinking eyes. With the power of <span class="char-style-override-5">Yoga</span> he entered into the body of Yudhi¦¢hira merging his limbs, senses and the vital airs with those of Yudhi¦¢hira. Viduraj¶’s body kept standing lifeless against that tree. Having led a virtuous life Viduraj¶ the embodiment of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> in the end entered into the body of Yudhi¦¢hiraj¶, <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma </span>in person<span class="char-style-override-5">.</span> Glory to the <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma.</span><span class="char-style-override-12"></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">SaÛjaya—The Honourable Minister</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">SaÛjaya was the minister of king Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra. He was a <span class="char-style-override-5">Sµuta</span> by caste. He was very loyal, intelligent and had a profound knowledge of <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> and ethics. He was truthful as well as intrepid. He offered sound advice to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and sometimes he uttered words which sounded bitter but were conducive to his well-being. He did not abandon his companionship with Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra till the end. He was the favourite of the great sage VedavyŒsa and a lover of Arjuna and Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. He strongly protested against the atrocities of Duryodhana and did not fail to rebuke even Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra in case he consented to his actions. When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> lost the stake in gambling for the second time and started living in the forest, bitterly criticizing the ill-treatment of Duryodhana to the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> he said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra–“O king, the utter destruction of your entire family is but inevitable, nay even the innocent subject of yours won’t survive. Grandfather Bh¶¦ma, DroÄŒcŒrya and Viduraj¶ repeatedly forbade your sons, still that shameless Duryodhana, having called righteous Draupad¶, the dear wife of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> into the assembly hall, insulted her. As the evil times approach nearer man’s wits become polluted. Even injustice seems to be just. Your sons have given open invitation to a fierce war by insulting in the crowded assembly hall beautiful Draupad¶ who is not born of a womb, is devoted to her husbands and had emerged from sacrificial altar. None but Duryodhana could do such a despicable act. Can even the most fearless minister make such disparaging but veracious remarks on a prince in the very presence of a monarch? Even the scriptures have observed—<span class="char-style-override-6">‘‘अप्रियस्य च पथ्यस्य श्रोता वक्ता च दुर्लभ:’’. </span>The hearer and the speaker of even beneficial word if they are unpleasant are found rare. Admitting that SaÛjaya was right, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra admitted his own weakness on account of which he could not prevent Duryodhana from perpetrating that atrocious action.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">SaÛjaya was a votary of peace and believed in persuasion. He tried his best to prevent the war and admonished both the sides by drawing their attention to the evil consequences of the war and the rift between them. <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> agreed but Duryodhana spurned the proposal of peace insultingly. Thus war became inevitable. It was predestined. Amongst <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> generally Bh¶¦ma, DroÄa, Vidura and SaÛjaya had a common opinion because all were votaries of righteousness and had in their hearts sympathy for the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span> All the four never hesitated to say the truth not caring for the displeasure of Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and his sons. Moreover truth is generally bitter.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On being sent to Upaplavya by Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra for holding peace talks with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> on his behalf, SaÛjaya approached them and sincerely praising them advised them to abstain from fighting. He said that neither <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma</span> nor material prosperity could be achieved through war. Settling the dispute through negotiation is the best means for establishing peace and king Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra too aspires for peace alone and not war. Being the favourite of both Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna, he profoundly believed that the matter pressed upon by him will not be avoided. As for Arjuna he went on to declare that Arjuna could offer even his life for him if he were asked to do so. This goes to prove that SaÛjaya had undivided love for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna. Yudhi¦¢hira very lovingly expressed his agreement with what SaÛjaya said but as far as the settlement of the dispute was concerned he put the condition that the kingdom of Indraprastha be restored to him. Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa also supported the proposal of the <span class="char-style-override-5">DharmarŒja</span> and SaÛjaya returned to HastinŒpura with the message from Yudhi¦¢hira. Approaching Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra he at first scolded him severely in a lonely place and subsequently in the presence of all conveyed to him the message of Yudhi¦¢hira and described to him the sort of preparations they were making for war and elaborately described the power of the warriors on the side of the PŒÄÎavas. Simultaneously establishing  the identification of one with the other told them how inseparably united Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna were with each other. He said that when he called on Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna both of them were present in the inner apartment. Entrance into the room they were in at the moment, was forbidden even to Abhimanyu, Nakula and Sahadeva. On reaching there he found that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa had placed His both legs on the lap of Arjuna and Arjuna’s legs were extended to the lap of Draupad¶ and SatyabhŒmŒ. This description given by SaÛjaya not only proves the identification of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna but also goes to prove that SaÛjaya had undivided love for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna. The place which was forbidden even for Abhimanyu, Nakula and Sahadeva and where Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna were sitting in privacy in informal way with their chief queens, was acceeded to without any hindrance by SaÛjaya who uninterruptedly took part in their private consultations also. These things show that in his dealings with Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna he was quite frank and informal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides being the lover of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa SaÛjaya possessed true knowledge of His divine aspect. Later on while describing to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra the glory of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in the presence of the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> VedavyŒsa, revered GŒndhŒr¶ and the high souled Viduraj¶, he referred to Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa as the Lord of all the realms. At this Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra asked him how he could know that Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa is the very embodiment of God whereas he failed to recognize him as such. While replying to this question SaÛjaya admitted in the presence of VedavyŒsa that he could recognize Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa in the true sense only through the eye of knowledge and but for such knowledge none could know Him in this way. He added that <span class="char-style-override-8">‘‘</span>I never resort to hypocrisy nor practise any pretentious <span class="char-style-override-5">Dharma;</span> moreover, my inner senses stand purified through the practice of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Yoga</span> of meditation.” Then VedavyŒsa himself praising SaÛjaya said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra—He possesses sound knowledge of the aspect of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the eternal Being, so if you listen to him he will rid you of the great fear of death.” There can be no better proof of the fact that SaÛjaya was endowed with learning. At this Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra lovingly asked SaÛjaya to let him know the path which might lead even him to the true knowledge of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and which may enable him to attain Supreme State. SaÛjaya explained to him thus—“Nobody can attain Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa without subduing the senses and senses can be overpowered only through renunciation. Knowledge can be acquired only through avoiding three things—negligence of duty, violence and worldly enjoyments. The supreme state can be attained only through abstaining from all the three. In the end SaÛjaya made a fine exposition to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra of some of the divine names of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa. This shows that SaÛjaya was well- versed in the scriptures as well.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When preparations for war had already been made on both sides and the two armies were pitched on the battlefield of Kuruk¦etra, VedavyŒsa while bestowing upon SaÛjaya the divine eye said to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra—“O King, this SaÛjaya will relate to you the happenings on the battlefield. Nothing on the entire battlefield shall lie hidden from his view. He will be invested with the divine eye and will become omniscient. He shall be able to visualize things seen and unseen, the occurrences during the day or night nay, even the inner thoughts shall stand revealed to him. Further more the weapons will not slay him, he won’t feel tiresomeness in spite of strenuous work and will be able to come out of the battlefield unharmed.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Well, since then SaÛjaya came to be invested with the divine eye by the grace of Lord VedavyŒsa. Sitting at one place he could view all the occurrences on the battlefield as if he were perceiving them with his own eyes and accurately described them to Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra. Sitting at one place he could know that on the battlefield of Kuruk¦etra extending for miles where eighteen Ak¦auhiÄ¶ army (one <span class="char-style-override-5">Ak¦auhiÄ¶ </span>consisting of infantry numbering 109350, cavalry numbering 65610, elephantry numbering 21870 and chariots numbering 21870) was engaged in fighting among themselves he could know that at a particular time which warrior was fighting and with whom, which weapons and how many times are being used by him and on whom they are being used, how often does he change his different feats and how many times, with what adroitness he saves himself from enemies’ attacks and what the particulars of his features are and what steed he is riding. He heard with his own ears the exhortations as contained in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Bhagavadg¶tŒ</span> given to Arjuna by Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ </span>18. 74-75). Not only did he listen to it, he observed as if he were seeing with his own eyes the facial expressions, the feelings that found expression on His face as well as His aspect as it was while exhorting Arjuna. Far less to speak of it when Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa revealed to Arjuna His cosmic aspect SaÛjaya too witnessed it in the same way as Arjuna did see it though this aspect was not seen by anyone before and about which the Lord himself declares thus in chapter XI verse 48­—I cannot be seen in this form by anyone else than you either through the study of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vedas</span> or of rituals or again through gifts, actions or austere penances.” Later on withdrawing His universal form the Lord showed Arjuna His four-armed form as Lord himself tells is exceedingly difficult to be perceived even by gods about which He has stated in verse 53 of chapter XI of the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> that neither through penance, gift or even rituals can this form be seen; still that rare form was beheld by the most blessed SaÛjaya although he was sitting in HastinŒpura. In the same context the Lord further explained to Arjuna that this form  could be seen only through single-minded devotion (<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 11.54). From this one can easily infer that SaÛjaya had an innate single-minded devotion to the Lord so that he could see that divine form. Even after hearing the recitation of the <span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> the memory of that form became a source of supreme delight to SaÛjaya. He himself describes that blissful state thus— </p>
<p class="Shlok">राजन्संस्मृत्य संस्मृत्य संवादमिममद्भुतम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">केशवार्जुनयो: पुण्यं हृष्यामि च मुहुर्मुहु:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">तच्च संस्मृत्य संस्मृत्य रूपमत्यद्भुतं हरे:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विस्मयो मे महान्‍राजन्हृष्यामि च पुन: पुन:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 18. 76-77)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Hearing over and over that sacred and mystic conversation between Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and Arjuna, O king! I rejoice again and yet again.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Remembering also again and again that most wonderful form of Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, great is my wonder and I rejoice over and over again.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This shows that the love and reverence he had for Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa was rational for he knew His true glory. Declaring their victory prior to the beginning of the actual fighting he predicted that—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत्र योगेश्वर: कृष्णो यत्र पार्थो धनुर्धर:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्र श्रीर्विजयो भूतिर्ध्रुवानीतिर्मतिर्मम॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-5">G¶tŒ</span> 18 .78)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Wherever there is Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa, the Lord of Yoga and wherever there is Arjuna, the wielder of the GŒÄÎ¶va bow, goodness, victory, glory and unfailing righteousness are there, such is my conviction.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">After the end of the war having stayed with Yudhi¦¢hira for sometime, Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and GŒndhŒr¶ proceeded towards the forest. SaÛjaya too followed them. There too he served his master in the best way and when he as well as GŒndhŒr¶ and Kunt¶ were surrounded on all sides by forest fire as directed by them he left their company and arrived at the hermitage to inform the sages that they had given up their mortal frame and thence proceeded toward the HimŒlayas. Thus the life of SaÛjaya was not an ordinary one. The lesson that we can draw from his life is that of whatever carte a man may be he can elevate himself to a high degree in his life through divine grace.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">VedavyŒsa—The Divine Being</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">VedavyŒsa, esteemed as <span class="char-style-override-5">BhagavŒn</span> to indicate his divinity, was the son of a great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> called ParŒÜara. He was born of the womb of Satyavat¶, the foster daughter of the king of <span class="char-style-override-5">Kaivartas</span>. VyŒsaj¶ was an exalted person endowed with supernatural powers. He was a great messenger of God born with a mission. Finding people losing their power of retention he compiled the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vedas</span> into four major heads—the <span class="char-style-override-5">¤Rgveda,</span> the <span class="char-style-override-5">Yajurveda,</span> the <span class="char-style-override-5">SŒmaveda</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-5">Atharvaveda</span> and taught these compilations to his disciples—one each. Each compilation was further divided into a number of heads and subheads. In this way through his efforts the Vedic literature received exhaustive treatment. The term VyŒsa means expansion and since the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vedas </span>were expanded through his efforts, he was verily called VedavyŒsa. He was born in an island and was dark complexioned so people called him K¾¦Äa DvaipŒyana also. On account of living in Badar¶vana he was given the name BŒdarŒyaÄa as well. All the eighteen <span class="char-style-override-5">PurŒÄas</span> (myths) including <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> were composed by him. In order to bring home to the people the essence of all knowledge contained in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Upani¦ads,</span> He devised <span class="char-style-override-5">Brahmasµutras</span> on which different <span class="char-style-override-5">AcŒryas</span> have attempted different expositions and propounded varied opinions of their own. A treatise entitled <span class="char-style-override-5">VyŒsa Sm¾ti,</span> whose authorship is attributed to him is also available. Thus the Hindu culture and the Indian literature is highly indebted to him. VyŒsaj¶ is called the chief exponent of the <span class="char-style-override-5">SanŒtanaDharma</span> (duties) laid down in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Vedas,</span> the scriptures and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PurŒÄas.</span> The Hindu race will ever remain highly indebted to him. So long as the Hindu race and Indian culture are not extinct the name of VyŒsaj¶ will remain immortal in the history. He can safely be called the beacon light and teacher to the world. That is why he enjoys the honour of being called <span class="char-style-override-5">Jagadguru</span> (which literally means the teacher  born to teach the world). On every <span class="char-style-override-5">Guru PµurÄimŒ,</span> a date which falls in second half of the month of <span class="char-style-override-5"> ¦ŒÎha</span> in the Hindu calendar (and which is auspicious to the worship of ones preceptor) every Hindu householder, who has faith in God, worships him. On account of him, the world is privileged to possess an unparalleled gem, the <span class="char-style-override-5">Bhagavadg¶tŒ,</span> containing the immortal teachings of Lord Ýr¶ K¾¦Äa and by inlaying the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> with this superb gem he placed them within the easy reach of the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">VedavyŒsa, the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i,</span> can see through all the times—the present, the past and the future. He can explore the heart of each and every man and can instantly reach any place at his will. Soon after his birth, having obtained the permission of his mother, he made his way to forest to perform austerities there. While departing he said to his mother that whenever she felt his absence, she should recall him to her mind and in no time she would find him by her side. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having escaped from the house built of lac through the device suggested by Viduraj¶, when the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas </span>began to live in the city called EkacakrŒ during that period VyŒsaj¶ visited them and in the context of his conversation told them the story of Draupad¶’s previous birth and assured them that the girl was pre-destined to be their wife. Hearing this the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were much pleased to go to PŒÛcŒla to take part in the <span class="char-style-override-5">SwayaÅvara</span> of Draupad¶. On reaching there Arjuna won Draupad¶ by fulfilling the conditions of the <span class="char-style-override-5">SwayaÅvara</span> and as desired by Kunt¶ the five brothers wanted to woo her. But king Drupada raised an objection to it. Meanwhile, VyŒsaj¶ arrived there and narrated to Drupada the story of Draupad¶’s previous birth and thus made him agree to marry his daughter to all the five brothers.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When emperor Yudhi¦¢hira was performing the <span class="char-style-override-5">RŒjasµuyaYajÛa</span> at Indraprastha, VedavyŒsa arrived there with the host of his discipies to take part in the <span class="char-style-override-5">YajÛa.</span> When the <span class="char-style-override-5">YajÛa</span> came to an end VedavyŒsaj¶ went to Yudhi¦¢hira to take leave of him. During the course of his conversation with him he said that after thirteen years since then the <span class="char-style-override-5">K¦atriyas</span> would be completely annihilated and you would be instrumental in it due to the fault of Duryodhana.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Duryodhana was not satisfied even after usurping their all and sending the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in exile for a period as long as twelve years. He began to devise plans for killing the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> while they were staying in the forest. In collusion with his maternal uncle Ýakuni, KarÄa and Du¬ÜŒsana he made plans  for attacking the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in a hidden manner and all of them having equipped themselves with arms and divine weapons and riding on their chariots started towards the forest. VyŒsaj¶ came to know about this plot through his divine eye and without any loss of time approached them and diverted them from the evil deed. In order to bring round Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra he went to him and said—“It is not a good thing that having defeated the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in gambling you have sent them to the forest. It will not yield good result. Remain careful if you cherish your own welfare and that of your sons. What a pity that evil- minded Duryodhana wants to kill the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> in order to usurp the throne. I warn you to check your overfondled son from doing such misdeed. He would better peacefully stay at home. If he tries to attempt at the lives of the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> he himself shall be deprived of his own life. If you do not eschew the hostile thoughts of your son, things may take a serious turn. In my opinion Duryodhana should go to the forest all by himself and stay with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span> Through the association with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> evil thoughts may be replaced by loving ones. But it is not so easy an affair, to transform one’s innate tendencies. If you want to protect the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and safeguard their lives, ask your sons to reconcile themselves with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span>” VyŒsaj¶ added—“The great ¤<span class="char-style-override-5">R¦i</span> Maitreya is due to arrive here very soon. He will exhort your sons to seek reconciliation with the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas.</span> You should act upon his advice without applying your mind to it. If you do not act upon his advice he will be angry and curse you.” But wicked Duryodhana did not act upon Maitreya’s advice and as such he had to become the target of his rage. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Not only VyŒsaj¶ could see through all the three times but also was endowed with unimaginable capabilities. When the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> were living in the forest, one day he approached them and imparted to Arjuna through Yudhi¦¢hira <span class="char-style-override-5">Sm¾tividyŒ</span> (the knowledge of remembrance) which made him capable of having the vision of God. Moreover, he bestowed SaÛjaya the Divine eye through which he could not only know the happenings of the battlefield but enabled him to see the cosmic form and the Divine four-armed form of the Lord as well. Besides he got the opportunity to hear the meritorious teachings of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Bhagavadg¶tŒ</span> which none but Arjuna had heard. When the Divine eye which endowed SaÛjaya with so many capabilities, it is difficult to imagine what would be the capabilities of VyŒsaj¶ himself who bestowed him the Divine eye. He was after all the partial manifestation of Lord NŒrŒyaÄa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day when Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra and GŒndhŒr¶ were living in the forest Yudhi¦¢hira with his family went to pay a visit to them. VyŒsaj¶ arrived there and finding that they were not till then rid of the sorrow caused by the bereavement of their sons and also finding GŒndhŒr¶ grieving over the separation of her sons, he told Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra to ask for a boon. Emperor Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra expressed the desire to know as to what could be the ultimate fate of their friends and kinsmen who had laid down their lives in the battle of <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span> and at the same time he requested VedavyŒsa to enable him to have a look at them. VyŒsaj¶ acceeded to his request and said to GŒndhŒr¶—“Tonight all of you shall see your departed relations in such an aspect as though they had awakened from sleep. Having performed their daily rituals in the evening, as desired by VyŒsaj¶, everyone gathered on the bank of the GaÆgŒ, entering into the sacred water of the GaÆgŒ, VyŒsaj¶ made a call for the warriors on the side of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas,</span> who had died in the war. Just then emerging from the water was heard such a tumultuous noise as was heard in the battle of Kuruk¦etra when the armies of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Kauravas</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-5">PŒÄÎavas</span> had gathered there. Then keeping Bh¶¦ma and DroÄa in the forefront, all the kings and princes who had died like warriors fighting, soon emerged from the waters. The warriors were wearing the same dress as they wore in the battlefield and their banners and vehicles were also the same in their minutest details. They were clothed in glorious garments and were wearing superb garlands. All of them were wearing brilliant ear-rings and their bodies were ashine with a celestial glow. Everyone looked as if he were rid of hostility, pride, anger and envy. Then <span class="char-style-override-5">Gandharvas</span> (the demigods) were singing their praises and the bards were offering them prayers. At that time VyŒsaj¶ bestowed Dh¾tarŒ¦¢ra the divine eye so that he could behold them well. That sight was strange, unimaginable and exhilarating. Everyone looked at the sight with unwinking eyes. Then all the warriors who had gathered there renouncing all their anger and hostilities, met with their relatives respectively. In this way the cordial meeting of the loving souls continued through the whole night. Then all of them entered into the water of the BhŒg¶rath¶ in the same manner as they had come out and departed to their respective celestial abodes. On that occasion addressing the ladies, whose husbands had laid down their lives fighting in the battlefield, he said­—“Those of you who want to attain the realms where your husbands are, should take a dip in the water of the GaÆgŒ.” Hearing him many a woman entered the water and casting aside their mortal frame reached the abode of their husbands. Just as putting on glorious garments and ornaments their husbands had appeared there so also putting on glorious garments and ornaments and seated in chariots, they reached at their destination.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Hither, when king Janamejaya heard about the marvellous incident his heart was filled with great curiosity and he himself desired to have a look at his dead father king Par¶k¦it. VyŒsaj¶ was already present there with a view to fulfil the desire of the king. He at once invoked king Par¶k¦it to appear in person. Janamejaya gave a bath to his father at the time when he himself took bath at the end of the <span class="char-style-override-5">YajÛa</span> and thereafter Par¶k¦it departed from there. Thus we see that the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i</span> VedavyŒsa was a super human and a powerful personality. I conclude this chapter by bowing low at revered feet of the great <span class="char-style-override-5">¤R¦i,</span> the author of the <span class="char-style-override-5">MahŒbhŒrata</span>.<span class="char-style-override-13" xml:lang="en-GB"></span></p>
