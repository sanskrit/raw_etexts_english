On Pītāmbara Siddhāntavāgīśa’s life:Gleanings from his own works

Pītāmbara Siddhāntavāgīśa,the most famous exponent of the Kāmarūpa
school of Dharmaśāstra is,in the tradition of many Sanskrit
authors,quite rectinent on his personal life. However he mentions the
following details

-   Dāyakaumudī:He was born at a place in the Southern part of the
    Lauhitya(Brahmaputra)
-   He was in a large part taught by his father(the benedictory verse of
    the Śrāddhakaumudī)
-   He was a smārta devotee of Nārāyaṇa and pays obeisances to
    Śiva,Durgā and Sūrya also. This last bit can be gleaned from the
    Daśakarmakaumudī where the term ‘śrīvāsudevamārādhya…’ is used.
-   He mentions in the end of his Śuddhikaumudī that he accomplished
    this work in 1534 śakābda(1612 CE)
-   In the colophon to his Grahaṇakaumudī he mentions that he was
    patronized by Lakṣmīnārāyaṇa of Kāmarūpa.

Siddhāntavāgīśa’s life:Gleanings from other sources

-   Bṛhatrājavaṃśāvalī states that Cilārāya the brother of Naranārāyaṇa
    brought Puruṣottama Vidyāvāgīśa(the author of the grammatical work
    Ratnamālā) and Pītāmbara from Gauḍa
-   He was also said to be a court poet of Naranārāyaṇa and probably
    served in the court of Balinārāyaṇa as well.
-   Maṇgaladair Buranji introduces him as the Dīkṣāguru of the king of
    Daraṇga,who donated a large amount of property in his province and
    his descendants still live there.
-   Nagendranath Vasu in his Social History of Kamarupa states that his
    kaumudīs were followed by the kings,citing the
    Bṛhatrājavaṃśāvalī,which noted that those who violated the rules and
    regulations of society as laid down for the various varṇas and
    āśramas of human society and life by Jagadguru Pītāmbara
    Siddhāntavāgīśa were punished by the king.

Some other works of his that are unpublished amongst digests are

is a part of Durgotsavakaumudī:oral communication). He also is credited
with writing commentaries on Vācaspati Miśra’s
Dvaitanirṇaya(Dvaitanirṇayadīpikā) and on the tantric digest
Śāradātīlaka(Guḍārthaprakāśikā). Very few of his works have been
published in print.
