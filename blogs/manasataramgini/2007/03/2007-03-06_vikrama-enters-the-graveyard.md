\-kShemendra

(1) kShemendra had studied with abhinavagupta the great kula/krama/trika
tantric and was evidently very familiar with the graveyard rituals of
shrIkula and kAlikula. He subsequently went over to the pA\~ncharAtra
school of tantric vaiShNavism. I suspect the vIrendra-s here refer to
the performers of vIrasAdhana (even as it does in the
lalitA-sahasranAmam- mahAvIrendra tanayA) invoking yogini-s in the
shmashAna. This vIrasAdhana is clearly mentioned in the brahma yAmala
whose other elements may color this poem.  
(2) Even bhaTTa somadeva uses a similar simile in his kathA-sarit-sAgara
which implies this comparison was there in the original
vetAla-pa\~nchaviMshati. Of course, both kShemendra and somadeva, with
the connections with trika and kula tantrism, would have seen the
comparison as appropriate.  
(3) In the mahAshmashAna dIkSha given in the brahma-yAmala we notice
invocation of rAkShasas headed by rAvaNa and pishAchas in the AvarNas
around bhairava holding the sword. This is also consistent with the rite
in the niHshvAsa-tattva tantra. Evidently this practice was well known
amongst the kashmirian kula tantrics.  
(4) It is peculiar that the women dance a tANDya dance, but this
reference to the sky-clad women dancing the shmashAna is clearly
inspired by the kula ritual with the kulA\~NganA-s described in the
jayadratha-yAmala. The shrIkula tantrics following jayaratha mention
that the ritual intercourse with the kulA\~NganA is preceded by her
harShaNa into an ecstatic state.  
(5) The use of the word chakreshvarI is again a clear allusion to the
kula ritual sanctioned by the pichumata of the pichu-maNDala performed
in the shmashAna, where the great goddess manifests as kulavidyA, the
chakreshvarI.
