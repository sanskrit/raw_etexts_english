## TO AN EARLY VIOLET

(Written to a Western lady-disciple from New York, 6th January 1896.)

What though thy bed be frozen earth,  
        Thy cloak the chilling blast;  
What though no mate to cheer thy path,  
        Thy sky with gloom o'ercast;

What though if love itself doth fail,  
        Thy fragrance strewed in vain;  
What though if bad o'er good prevail,  
        And vice o'er virtue reign:

Change not thy nature, gentle bloom,  
        Thou violet, sweet and pure,  
But ever pour thy sweet perfume  
        Unasked, unstinted, sure!
