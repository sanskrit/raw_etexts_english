## CCVI

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,

*14th October 1901*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

Just now came a letter from Mrs. Bull, but none from you, as I expected
one this mail.

Mrs. Bull writes, "I wrote Christina recently to ask her if she were to
be free in case the opportunity opened for her to go to the East. I send
you her reply".

I went through several times your letter to Mrs. Bull. It surely was
horrible; and you have been all this time hiding the real state of
affairs from me and posing great cheerfulness!!

You will be a precious fool to lose the opportunity if such comes and is
offered by Mrs. Bull. You will only have to take a year's leave. The
rest will all be arranged by Mrs. Bull, including, I am sure, all your
anxiety for those you will have to leave behind in Detroit.

You have been good, too good to be human, and you are so, still. But it
is no use making oneself unnecessarily miserable. "Mother's will",
surely, if the chance comes; and it has got to come, I know.

I would not write you about my health; for after all this hide and seek,
even though it was for my good, I think you have not much of a right to
know the truth about my health.

But to some things you have eternal rights, and amongst others, to my
eternal love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
