<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Preface</p>
<p class="Text">Love is a divine emotion. By this unique emotion of love the devotees have made the Lord under their sway, it was then only the Lord had to say—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘अहं भक्त पराधीन।’</span> ‘I am under the sway of My devotees. Basically, it is the selfless dedication of My devotees to Me—their exclusive and the deepest love is the most favourite to Me. This love establishes the supernatural oneness between the Lord and devotees. The emotion of love is much higher and superior to all the other servantly and friendly attitudes of devotion etc. Here, looking different even in identity the Lord and the devotee both come to be one. This is the unique oneness of love.</p>
<p class="Text">In the present book the very valuable ideas and thoughts of Shri Jayadayalji Goyandka have been expressed by himself about how to attain the love to the Lord, its excellent glory, faith and devotion and the importance of unselfish motive and the needful means of self-welfare and to fulfilment of human life. Through the thirteen articles of this book this great and spiritually exalted man has inspired for the proper practice of spiritual exercise for the purpose of the detachment from the world and love and devotion to the Lord in a very easy and easily intelligible language. The sermons given by the reverent Shri Goyandakaji are being published here in the form of articles. All the articles are very worthful for the seekers to attain the Lord by developing the emotion of love to the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">It is expected that all the loving readers, the inquisitive and devotee gentlemen will take more advantage by pondering over and careful study and will oblige us by motivating their acquainted persons and lovers also to take advantage from this book.	<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Exceptional Oneness in Love</p>
<p class="Shlok">मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु। </p>
<p class="Shlok">मामेवैष्यसि सत्यं ते प्रतिजाने प्रियोऽसि मे॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वधर्मान्यरित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज। </p>
<p class="Shlok">अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुचः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 18/65-66)</p>
<p class="Text">The above verses said by Lord Krishna are full of highest passion—</p>
<p class="Text">‘Give your mind to Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and bow to Me. Doing so, you will come to Me alone, I truly promise you; for you are exceptionally dear to Me.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Resigning all your duties to Me, the All-powerful and All-supporting Lord, take refuge in Me alone. I shall absolve you of all sins, worry not.’</p>
<p class="Text">Can there be anything greater than this? The scriptures are endless. It was not only Arjuna the highest devotee, the past is rich of the devotees even superior to him. In <span class="char-style-override-5">‘Shrimadbhagwat’ </span>the Lord Himself states—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘ता मन्मनस्का मत्प्राणा:’</span> (10/46/4)</p>
<p class="Text">None knows the spiritual truth so much as the Gopis know. The Lord said to Arjuna—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘मन्मना भव’</span>. ‘Give your mind to Me.’ But the Gopis were already so as they were completely devoted to Him.</p>
<p class="Text">If anyone gives advice to any early-riser who already gets up before Sun-rise surely he will laugh that he does not know at all. So, the Lord cannot give such sermons to the Gopis. The Gopis were of much higher category than Arjuna. It cannot be uttered so before him who is an exclusive devotee of the Lord that ‘I truly promise you and assure you.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord said to Arjuna—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘मां शुच:’</span>. ‘Worry not.’ I shall absolve you of all sins. If he knows the Lord’s nature, how could he come to worry? The devotees of the higher rank don’t want forgiveness for their sins. They don’t even say—‘You are of a great forgiving disposition, you are a compassionate’. You don’t mind even the demerits of your servants. They remain satisfied with their sufferings for their sin. Arjuna did accept the exemption.</p>
<p class="Text">There is a very valuable lesson for us in <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>–We are not even equal to Arjuna also. We want salvation also and want to remain free from worry too. But those who are the devotee of higher category don’t say to the Lord of the “forgiving disposition and merciful.” Why should we call Him even friendly to the meek and humble? It is they to speak so who have any selfish expectation from Him. They are the flatterers who call Him merciful. We don’t say so and we are not eager for His mercy also. You are the shelterer of the destitute, orphans and afflicted ones, show your mercy to them. If a millionaire comes to you and you offer him two rupees as gift, he will say “give it to any poor.” Where there is the love of higher category, there is no meaning of any feeling, all the mental attitudes of different kinds of feeling are removed; there remains neither the discrimination of superior and inferior, nor servantly attitude, nor the affectionate attitude and not the amorous sentiment. There is no sentiment of husband or sentiment of paramaour at all, then how amorous love is possible there? The Lord is husband and I am His devoted wife’–no such feeling also, not even the friendly attitude is there. This is not describable. There is no question of non-identity at all there. Though they look two outwardly but in real sense they are one. As there are two hands and when they are joined together they become one. Which of them is bigger or smaller? It is a matter of mind to think—Whether they are one or two? Despite being two they are one. But here, even being one they are apparently two. Despite being two they are one according to the philosophy of Vedanta. In love they seemingly two are identical.</p>
<p class="Text">In such a highest category of love there is a unique love even more than Vedanta, there is a supernatural love of the same category—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थितः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/31)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Yogi who is steadfast in union with Me as dwelling in all beings as their very Self, abides in Me, no matter what he does.’</p>
<p class="Text">To be steadfast in union with the Lord is oneness and whatever activities he performs with God, is the difference of identity. So, both the identity and non-identity came in the example. To be established in the union with the Lord and to sing the devotional song is an unique worship. There is not pronounced ‘the Lord’ because there is oneness. The love, lover and the object of love all the three are one. There, they both are the lovers and they both are objects of love. In the view of either of the both is lover and the next is the object of love. This is the climax of oneness. There the matter of virtues and merging in the form is left far away. As the servants and attendants of a king remain outside.</p>
<p class="Text">The Gopis have the feeling of sweetness (the sentiment of conjugal love) in the Lord. This is what is mentioned above is the matter of the highest category, there the Gopis are on watch. There is nothing like influence and virtues; and where there is the love based on glory and virtues, there he thinks that the Lord is not important but His virtues and glory are important only. To love on the ground of merits is inferior even to the husband’s devotion. He doesn’t love because of the virtues. Whatsoever he may be, our job is only to love. Where there comes the reference of perfect love, there like two hands, they don’t love each other due to any quality; similarly there is no difference between the Lord and His lover also. There is no specialty in the Lord. There all three become one. The Lord, Devotion and devotee–all the three become one. Such a situation is created there.</p>
<p class="Text">So much has been said but yet insufficient not equal to even a single penny has been said. In reality the thoughts regarding love are like an ocean and whatever came to mind that is like a drop in the ocean and whatever was expressed in words that are merely an atom. If it is described throughout the life, that cannot complete the full drop even.</p>
<p class="Text">As a matter of fact, may our life pass in this discussion! Neither there is need of the Lord’s attainment and nor anything else. Our life should pass only in this way, that is enough. Don’t desire to meet, and for salvation and for the favourable circumstances. Although it is good, but think that this spiritual discipline is better. The accomplishment will be attained automatically. But to make the practice of spiritual exercise having the accomplishment its only goal, it will be delay. Leaving the aim of accomplishment  aside if you remain devoted to the practice, the accomplishment will be attained earlier very soon.</p>
<p class="Text">Instead of the desire to attain the Lord go on treading on the path without the desire to attain the Lord, the Lord will be attained soon. If even this desire is also not cherished it is much better.</p>
<p class="Text">If our discussion starts to continue of the highest form, the God will not go from there even after forcing Him to go out. Lest the rule should be passed that the Lord’s entry is prohibited here, He may come here when the discussion is over.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord comes to hesitation there. The devotee gets victory over the Lord. This is the real means to get victory.</p>
<p class="Text">Lord and devotee—these words apply here. There hereafter in the sight of the both each other they both are Lord and they both are devotee. That is the supernatural talk. That is an effort only before the meeting with the Lord. The meeting of Rama and Bharat can be taken for example. Tulsidasji states that ‘it cannot be described in words’. Rama and Bharat meet each other, but that is not the union like such. How excellent that meeting is, when it is the Lord who meets the Lord. The effort of the devotee is to develop progressively the exhilaration in the Lord’s heart and the Lord’s effort is to develop gradually exhilaration in the devotee’s heart. This meeting of the both is extraordinary and unique than the meeting of joining two hands. At that time all the limbs of the body assume the embodiment of love. The lovers, limbs and effort, all assimilate in love. They merge to oneness. To present the picture of this union by speech is quite impossible.</p>
<p class="Text">The entire body, limbs and efforts all merge to love. There does not remain love. The Lord and the devotee both identity themselves, they also lose their own identity, they are not at all different. Our love is inanimate, but that love is  conscious one. There the lovers are personifications of love. There is neither the sense of lover and love. There is only one love, that is pure love, it is the love only that is the Lord and love is the devotee and there is only love and love. There are three only in numbers.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord’s effort is only for the devotee’s exhilaration and the devotee’s effort is for the Lord’s exhilaration, but reaching there later on also the explanation of love and joy comes to end, there remains no separate explanation of the Lord and the devotee also, all merge to a single one. Whatever we may want we can say for understanding. There is no union of Vedanta here, that is the path of knowledge and there is the priority of that only. Here lies the priority to love. None can explain about its fruit. Only he, who attains it can realize. ‘Can know’—It is also only to say, basically, it can also not be expressed. What does he know? Indeed he verily becomes. What does he become? It can be known when he so becomes.</p>
<p class="Text">What is its means? The means is only what we are doing. As in the sweetness–devotion of the Lord there is the exhilarating power of Shri Radhikaji,  she is to cause embodiment of bliss, Brahma in the manifest form of Shri Krishna dance through exhilaration. The devotion in exhilaration is separate one and the loving devotion is the separate one because of giving bliss to the Lord, Shri Radhikaji was the blissful power and the Lord was the power of love. Whereas the Lord gives pleasure to Shri Radhikaji, ‘He is the blissful power there and Shri Radhikaji is loving power.'</p>
<p class="Text">The followers of Gaudiya sect say–‘by the union of the both only there is the incarnation of Gaurang Mahaprabhu. The identification of the both cannot be explained on the basis of the characteristics of their union. There is no characteristic, of virtue, then how to explain. There is only the pure love in totality. The Lord, Himself, is only love and it is the love only what is the Lord. Radhikaji is Krishna and Krishna is Radhikaji.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">This condition of oneness is the highest. He, who has achieved this climax, has to do nothing. The condition of his body cannot be expressed through words. The Sun does not appear in the mirror but it is his reflection that appears. In our view his body becomes personification of love complete. Just as the mirror starts glittering by the sunlight, similarly, he becomes apparently the embodiment of love. If anyone moves about with the musk with him, its fragrance diffuses all around; its fragrance may not be experienced only by him whose nose is defective. In the same way when he moves anywhere he walks scattering the love. It is said–When Gaurang Mahaprabhu walked on the path, the entire path used to be suffused with love. The people used to be overwhelmed with love to see the condition of his body intoxicated in love. Such a lover is the conglomeration of love. Only to see him, to touch him the people are overwhelmed with love. Such is the supernatural state of such men.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">The glory of devotees</p>
<p class="Text">The devotees of the Lord are considered greater than the Lord even to some extent; because for the attainment of the Lord the association of His devotees, conduct according to their command, meditation, seeking shelter and service—these five are the main means; but it is difficult to bring all these five in practice in favour of the Lord. These can be practised in favour of the devotees very easily, the fruit of the both is the same. As any chaste woman can attain the Supreme Being by the practice of all these five means in here practical life with her husband with unselfish motive, likewise the spiritual aspirant can attain the Supreme Being by using these five for the true devotee of the Lord. </p>
<p class="Text">(a)	What is the difficulty in utilizing these five means in respect of God and what is the easiness in respect of a devotee, it should be understood. </p>
<p class="Text">1. The seeker does not get the company of the Lord but the company of His devotee can be got.</p>
<p class="Text">2.	The Lord’s direct command cannot be achieved; these are the rules of the religious treatise only which have to be followed; by the command of the Lord’s devotees we can act upon accordingly and can shape up our conduct according to it. The difference of opinion in the religious treaties also can be made clear through the devotees.</p>
<p class="Text">(b) If we assume the mental impulses as the command of God, there are various impulses at a time. Through devotees only we can get their veracity. </p>
<p class="Text">3. There is no virtual photograph of the Lord’s images. So, while meditating the Lord in the mind such a doubt may be created that whether that is the actual form of the Lord or not. But the apparently visible living form of the devotee can be meditated doubtlessly. </p>
<p class="Text">4.	Apparently seeking shelter to the Lord is not possible but is possible in the case of His devotee.</p>
<p class="Text">5.	The service also may be given to the idols of the Lord (although according to the mentality and thinking of the seeker, no doubt, that is already the Lord) yet the striver has the sentiment of the symbolic or representing attitude only in the idols; there remains no sentiment of apparent view, but the seeker can offer his services to the apparent visible form of the devotee. Thus the true devotee of God is superior to God.</p>
<p class="Shlok">मोरें मन प्रभु अस बिस्वासा। </p>
<p class="Shlok">राम ते अधिक राम कर दासा॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘It is the firm conviction of my mind that Rama’s servant is more than Rama, Himself.’It has been described only the characteristics of a devotee in principle. But the devotees have the complete restriction for the use of the rest three out of five as regards the meditation, service and seeking shelter except the company and to emulate his conduct. They always insist to serve the Lord, to meditate the Lord only and seeking His shelter only and their narrative is true also, though only their service serves the purpose but they restrain to maintain the propriety of the scriptures. Why don’t they restrain for the company and emulation of conduct accordingly? This is their mercy and by doing so the dignity of the religious treatise is also not affected by any way. The company can never be objectionable at all, in the emulation of conduct there lies the good of the seeker while maintaining the dignity of the religious treaties. That is why they don’t restrain for the company and conduct. If thinking of himself perfect anyone agrees that—‘There is no self loss at all in getting three practised for him; because I am a accomplished one, these seekers will at least get the benefit, so they should be allowed to do so–then it should be considered that the man thinking of himself to be perfect is yet ignorant and full of darkness. Basically he is not fulfilled one.</p>
<p class="Text">In taking the service there is the decay of penance, devotion, glory, reverence and virility. Out of them the glory means the dignity and repute in the world may decay even of the perfect one. By getting the service done the penance does decay. By going the portion of the spiritual aspirants devotion to the servant by and by his devotion decays. </p>
<p class="Text">In the eye of the unworthy servant, the reverence for the striver decays if servant is called again and again for service. The reverence decays only when the server or the served is undeserving.</p>
<p class="Text">If the server is deserving it is gain there. It is he who is considered worthy of service who may remain free from the least arrogance to be created in the mind on getting the service, rather there is great pleasure in the service, where it may start thrilling in the body and the flow of tears from the eyes. The service should be rendered without any pressure on mind with the enthusiasm of service, the interest and selflessness may go on growing progressively day by day and only that service should be rendered that may be favorable to the mind of the served. Contrary to it he who gives the service suitable to his own mind considering it a burden or labour, is not worthy of service. A devotee even in the condition of his ailment and physical suffering, does not command for his service that may prove burden to others.</p>
<p class="Text">The higher love to the devotee should be approved then when even the salvation may be neglected before the love of devotee. If the devotee says—‘Brother! Engage yourself in the devotion to the Lord, it will provide you salvation.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">Then, in the reply that lover seeker should think only this and say–‘I have no love in you, I am eager of salvation, that is why you are telling me the way to salvation. Where is love there until I am free from the desire of salvation? The devotees are at beck and call of such a loving seeker who remains ready even to sacrifice the desire of the Lord’s attainment wholeheartedly with the true spirit of mind. They both are in such a deep love that while talking in seclusion that striver does not care even for the call of the Lord if He, Himself comes and calls from the outside, he says—‘Why have you visited here to create disturbance in our conversation at this scheduled place?’ Although in that scheduled place it is the discussion about the Lord only going on but he is free from the care of attaining the Lord. Even the Lord likes such an indifferent but loving devotees and remains desirous how he should desire to meet Him. But that aspirant absorbed in love doesn’t care at all by any way. If even the Lord disguised in the form of his lover comes to meet him and he comes to know it, begins to curse even taking it a treachery and realizing the break of his resolve like the husband devotee Vrinda. The devotees wait upon of the beck and call of such lovers only. The seeker who loves his devotee to attain the Lord, the devotees make efforts for his deliverance only but they don’t stand at his beck and call. As the husband remains perfectly satisfied with his that chaste wife also who serves husband considering it her duty for the attainment of the Lord and he loves her definitely; but he does not become a slave to her. But the woman who is completely dedicated to her husband’s love only for the sake of love and doesn’t care for the God even; her husband always remains in her subservience.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">The significance of reverent faith and unselfish motive in God-realization</p>
<p class="Text">All the highest virtues are sentimental. The top among them are the unselfish motive, and feeling of love, the supreme reverent fatih. These are the best and the highest sentiments. The mercy is also a sentiment, the feeling of equanimity is also a sentiment, the tranquility is also a feeling. Each and every noble sentiment is conducive to salvation. The reverent faith is of the highest category sentiment in God or the supreme being and the great man or the exalted soul, it changes the condition. But even after the repeated emphasis on faith and reverence these are not created. Its reason does not come to the mind why is the emotion of faith and reverence not created in our mind? Although the people want to have faith and reverence by their mind and thought but yet such faith does not become possible in practice. Doubtlessly it comes to our understanding by the pleas that if we have to develop faith and devotion to the either of the two–the Supreme Being or the great soul, then we should see virtues in them. By observing virtues in them the devotion is multiplied and the reverse decreases the faith and devotion. Besides this in the purity of inner-sense develops the devotion. To purify the inner-sense the virtuous deeds according to the ordains of the Shastras should be done with the unselfish motive. The Japa (muttering of the Lord’s name), penance, charity, service, the visit of pilgrimage, keeping vows etc., all these noble deeds as mentioned in the Shastras if they are adopted in the conduct and practised in the practical life with unselfish motive, the inner sense is purified. By the practice of devotion to the Lord with unselfish motive also our inner organ is purified very soon. The people perform the virtuous deeds also according to the sense of their minds also, and they have the selfless motive also to the best possible extent but some of our brothers even don’t understand the essence of selfless motive and perform the Lord’s devotion with the selfish motive, they fail to perform even the Lord’s devotion also and even the virtuous deeds are also not done by them but in other words the noble deeds are completely given up by them which proves to be the cause of their downfall. It should not be so. There should be thorough improvement in this, suppose any member of your family suffer from a disease, there should be celebration of the <span class="char-style-override-5">‘Gayatripurshcharan’</span> or common religious ritual without any selfish motive. This religious ritual should be performed selflessly or to be performed for the purification of the inner sense with the purpose to attain the Supreme Being, not for the disease to be cured. The religious ritual celebrated thus, leaves its effect of great importance. Such religious ceremonies should be performed by self from time to time or get it performed, it may be occasional or only at sometimes. For the redemption of the soul ‘Japa’ (muttering of Lord’s name) and the recitation of the hymns of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> etc., should be performed. By doing so our innerorgan is purified. This is the best method.</p>
<p class="Text">The desire of honour, praise and repute is very petty, by doing the action with selfish motive, our innersense can never be purified even though remaining doing births after births. The Lord’s devotion practised with selfish motive is useful to some extent if there is love and devotion.</p>
<p class="Text">By the company of faithful the faith develops. ‘The faith is more valuable than any other thing’ by such a thought also there is enhancement in the faith. ‘The Lord is the most reverent to us and the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> is the words uttered by the Lord Himself, this is His command–Such devotion should be there in the mind. The devotion to a great soul depends on the sincerity of the obedience of his command. This is the touchstone of devotion. The sermons, the principles of the Lord are owned by him who has devotion and faith in the Lord. He acts upon according to the mind, attitude, indication, inspiration and the command of the Lord. The disobedience of His command is utterly impossible by him at any cost. The command is a farfetched affair, even His indication is enough for him, he directs his whole life only according to His indications. Similarly, if anyone’s devotion is developed for any exalted soul, the principles of that holy soul become the principles of the devoted one’s own life. All the actions of the devoted man’s life are performed according to reverent’s mental attitude and indications. Whenever the Lord incarnates the actions of the devotees who recognize Him are performed according to the indications of the Lord. As a puppet dances on the indication of the stage manager.</p>
<p class="Text">Once Baldeoji saw that all the cowherds and calves were looking in the form of Krishna. He asked the Lord–‘What is the matter?’, He said—‘Brahmaji has kept all the cow-herds and calves hidden to put me on test. So, it is I wandering about in their forms. Baldeoji came to understand that secret. Likewise the Gopis understood the feelings and mind of the Lord. They acted upon his indications, they visualized the Lord only everywhere in all the objects. All the activities of the Lord were the sportive display for them. His all the activities were the source of joy for them. That was the actual sportive display. We also see the dramatic episodes on the life of Krishna, there our feelings are not of high category and the dramatic episodes also not played according to the classical methods. So, no more benefit can be taken from them. We should remain seeing the frolicsome activities what Shri Ramachandraji played having incarnated. His character what has been sketched in the Ramayan apparently before our sight remembering His those activities in mind as the Lord departed for the woods, visited the hermitages of the sages and doing the frolicsome activities in such a way. That is specially beneficent to us.</p>
<p class="Text">In the world whosoever the great souls are in fact their whole character and actions are the frolicsome activities only. If we observe them with this view our devotion can increase. When our devotion is developed to the Lord and our thoughts and feelings become of superior category, the sense of each and every verse of Gita seems wonderful to us. Such a devoted one realizes the sight of Vasudev and Vasudev only everywhere and in every object – </p>
<p class="Shlok">बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते। </p>
<p class="Shlok">वासुदेवः सर्वमिति स महात्मा सदुर्लभः॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘In the very last of all births the enlightened person worships Me realizing that all this is God. Such a great soul is very rare, indeed.’</p>
<p class="Text">It means that in the very last of all births all this is God. Thus, knowing he who adores the God and worships the Lord, such a great soul is very rare and of a very high category. He perceives the form of God only everywhere and in every object. In the each and every object as a whole he gets the apparent view of the Lord. The man who knows the Tattva of water sees only water and water in the clouds, ice and air etc., he doesn’t see any other object in them except water. Similarly, he who has already realized the absolute truth about the Supreme Being, sees the whole world as the form of the Supreme Being. When the entire world is the form of the Supreme Lord and so, all the actions and functions of this world are the frolicsome activities of the Supreme Lord. He who takes this world with this view, how can the Lord be separated from him? The Lord has stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/30)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He who sees Me (the universal self) present in all beings, and all beings in Me, never loses sight of Me, nor do I ever lose sight of him.’ As an enlightened one sees the clouds in the sky and the sky in the clouds, the existence of the sky is never erased from his mind. It is the sky only that takes the form of water being changed into the form of air and luster and then water, clouds, ice, hailstones and rain drops, all are the origin of sky, it means it is the sky only that looks in all these changed forms. He who comes to know this essence of sky sees only the sky how it can be hidden to him? Take the Lord in the place of sky then only God will be visible everywhere. The sky is already inanimate, so those who want to see sky, it is not visible to them. But the Lord is Super consciousness, so we call Him ‘Bhagwan’—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/11)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Arjuna, howsoever men seek Me, even so do I approach them.’</p>
<p class="Text">The man who sees the Lord everywhere as omnipresent, the Lord cannot be hidden to him, contrary to it He always remains seeing him. This is the highest type of worship. For such a devotee the Lord states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थितः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/31)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Yogi who is established in union with Me, and worship Me as dwelling in all beings as their very self, abides in Me, no matter what he does.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, he who is established in union with Me and worships Me and realizes Me dwelling in all beings everywhere, such a realization is taking delight in Me. In his mind there is no existence of any other object except Mine at all. For the practice of spiritual exercise, this is the practice of the highest category and this is the natural state of a perfect one. He who being overwhelmed with such an emotion makes it his practice for every time, for him the embodiment of truth knowledge and blis formless without attributes the Supreme Being having transformed Himself to the manifested form with the attributes remains always apparently visible to him, Prahlad had reached such a state. He used to realize the form and existence of God everywhere. The same was the condition of the Gopis also. Such enlightenment and the realization of the formless absolute truth, the Supreme Being without attributes comes by the devotion—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानम्’</span> ‘Enlightenment comes by devotion.’ After the enlightenment the perfect peace of mind is attained very soon—</p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 4/39)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Having had the revelation of Truth, he immediately attains the Supreme peace in the form of God realization.’</p>
<p class="Text">Similarly He who comes to realize the mystery and truth of the great soul, begins to see all the activities of the saint as the sportive display and he too, becomes a great soul doing everything in his life according to the great soul’s will. The feels of the great soul become his feelings.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the feelings and experiences of the illumined soul’s mind and heart are and whatever is uttered by his speech are the scriptures, the other men also follow the same conduct what the holy and virtuous man behaves in his own practical life. Whatever is approved by such a pious soul becomes the ideal and religious rule of conduct for the people—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 3/21)</p>
<p class="Text">‘For, whatever a great man does also that very thing other men also do; whatever standard he sets up, the generality of men follow the same.’</p>
<p class="Text">In the beginning of the creation whatever was commanded by the unbegotten Brahma is famous by the name of the Vedas. The sages whosoever realized the hymns of Vedas, were considered the sages of high rank—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘मन्त्रद्रष्टारो ऋषय:’</span>, ‘They were considered the seer who were the seers of Vedic chantings. They, who realized the sense of the ‘Vedic Mantras’ were seers. Whatever the feelings of the seers heart have been expressed by their speech they are called scriptures and also they are ‘Smriti’. As the <span class="char-style-override-5">‘Bhagwat Gita’</span> is the <span class="char-style-override-5">‘Bhagwat Smriti’</span>. Here in this book there has been the development of the Lord’s feelings of heart apparently through the speech. The Lord has given the sermons of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> by making Arjuna the cause. <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> is the expression of the Lord’s heart. So, that is the Lord’s heart. Since it has been expressed by the means of speech, so it is called the Lord’s verbal image of the Lord also. So, thinking the sermons of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> as our deity, if we worship it, our redemption can be possible. There remains not the least doubt in our salvation if we shape our life according to the Lord’s sermon, command and purpose. Even by assuming a single verse of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> with the understanding of its sense in our life, we can attain deliverance. There are several such verses which even a single foot has such a powerful capacity that we can attain the Lord according to it, but there should be faith and devotion in this. If we have faith and devotion we cannot go against it. Regularly novel thoughts and feelings are created in our mind. The meaning and sense of the verses of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> come to glitter and the supernaturality in it illuminates over mind. With the gradual enhancement of our devotion our emotion also enhances enhancement of our devotion our emotion also enhances with the same speed and when the emotion comes to develop, the seeker cannot be separated from this. By the gradual enhancement of the emotion, the supreme faith is established. He begins to see the apparent view of the Lord in all the beings everywhere. Already the Lord is omnipresent, it is the lack of our faith due to which He is not visible to us. The great soul looks to us like a common man till we don’t recognize him. When we regard him a great soul the very moment our attitude to him is changed.</p>
<p class="Text">The same is in the case with the Lord also. In the Treta age when Hanumanji saw the Lord Rama and Lakshman for the first time, he found some peculiarity in Him, but due to being in human incarnation he was looking like a man. Hanumanji asked and the Lord replied him. During of conversation with the Lord the feelings of Hanumanji completely changed in a moment.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Shri Krishna was acting the role of a child. Brahmaji got deluded seeing the childish activities of Shri Krishnaji. By the Lord’s grace when the delusion of Brahmaji was removed, the same Brahmaji began to see the Lord Shri Krishna in another form.</p>
<p class="Text">The sage Uttank had formed his opinion about the Lord Shri Krishna that He was a great influential personality. He was unaware of the fact that He was the Supreme Lord. When he became ready to curse the Lord, the Lord Himself introduced to him and gave him the glimpse of His universal self, the very moment the sage Uttank’s feelings changed. He came to realize that He was the apparent Supreme Being. The Lord, Himself said—‘I appear in the manifested form of god or a demi God etc. At present I have incarnated in manifested form of a human being. Since you don’t know Me so you became ready to curse Me. Please don’t curse Me because your curse will not be effective on Me and reverse to it your penance in the form of Guru service will be destroyed. Only for its protection I have disclosed My secret before you that I am apparent, the Supreme Being and having manifested in the form of human being I am acting the sportive display. Even then when he did not rely on Him, the Lord made him believe by showing him the form of His Universal self. Sometimes the Lord does so also. Then, whether the God will not appear for him who is devoted to the Lord, who wants to realize Him then for whom will He appear?</p>
<p class="Text">At the time of incarnation, the form and appearance what was of Shri Krishna, was just like a human being. In appearance, there was nothing unique in Him in the comparison to a man. There was nothing supernatural in Him. His hands feet and physical appearance everything was similar to that of a common man. He played like other children in His childhood. That is why His frolicsome activities brought even Brahmaji to delusion. When Brahmaji realized His form and potency, his attitude at once changed.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">In the same way the devotion develops in them to see the influence of the exalted souls as well as of the Lord and their virtuous qualities and due to devotion and faith, their merits and influence become visible to us. By the company of the faithful faith is created then by supreme faith the perfect peace and the Lord is attained.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Service, Japa, meditation, love and restlessness</p>
<p class="Text">The scriptures have stated the selfless service and selfless prayer as the means of Lord’s attainment. There is not so much selfishness in the man who serves with unselfish motive and begs for the alms of service, makes prayer—‘O Lord! Provide me opportunity of service; as much selfishness in demanding the Lord’s sight. If anyone requests me that I should make him get the Lord’s sight here lies his selfishness. It is so because he wants the Lord’s sight for free. He, who provides him the Lord’s sight did serve him. If the opportunity of rendering service is get the giver of such opportunity obliges us with his obligation. Labour is also required in giving service, so the attitude of selflessness is more in service than getting the free sight of the Lord. These feelings are full of essence. People’s minds are covered with darkness. They see that he is a very noble man, he is requesting for the Lord’s sight. It is right that he is praying to get the Lord’s sight and the other is begging for service. If anyone comes to me and says—‘Get me to view the God and the other who asks for the job of service to me the man who requests for service seems better than the former.</p>
<p class="Text">Here, this is the matter to think over—There are the two short comings in the first one, because he wants to get the sight of the Lord free and secondly he asks to get him provided the Lord’s sight. He has no reverence at all. Really, he doesn’t want to view the Lord’s sight. If anyone says to desire for the Lord’s sight and to be eager for the service–between the both to desire for the Lord is a higher and more important, then he is quite ignorant of the essence of service because he wants to meet the Lord without singing the devotional song free without any adoration. The attainment of the Lord is very difficult for them who think the devotional song unremunerative job and only labour for nothing.</p>
<p class="Text">They who have no faith and devotion as well as interest in the devotional song, really they don’t sing the devotional song, actually, they are not theist.</p>
<p class="Text">He, who makes the practice of devotional song but feels it the laborious work then it should be considered that he has secondary devotion and love in the adoration, he lacks in remembrance. When he remembers he starts his practice also but here, he does not feel any labour and does not feel any pleasure also. He thinks that if the Lord is attained only by the little practice of devotional song it is much better. His practice of devotional song is not significant; because he has only the ordinary love, interest and devotion in the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">He, whom the devotional song is dear and his interest is there, never wants to leave its practice. If he forgets, on his forgetfulness he repents, in such a condition it should be considered that he has some special interest and devotion in the devotional songs. While singing the devotional song in the praise of the Lord, the singer of the devotional song enjoys peace and feels pleasure and he wants his devotional song to be remained continuing forever, even then sometimes the mistake is but—natural. In such a situation the love, interest and devotion in the Lord is the main. Even more than this is that he becomes so much addicted of worship by singing the songs in praise of the Lord that it is never missed by him and if missed he feels a great restlessness in his mind. He cannot tolerate the mistake and becomes very sad. In such a condition it is presumed that he has a great devotion, keen interest and deep love in the God or in other words it can be said that it is presumed keen or like exclusive. And more ahead than this is that, it is impossible for him to commit any mistake. Really, for him the devotional song in praise of the Lord and His meditation is more important than even the Lord. On one side the goal is to attain the Lord and on the other side the devotional song and meditation is to be left, in such a case he prefers devotional song and meditation, whether the Lord is attained or not. He has profound love, devotion and keen interest in the Lord. Even superior to him is that seeker who cannot leave the ‘Japa’ (muttering of Lord’s name) and meditation of the Lord instead of it he can sacrifice his life. The divorce of devotional song and meditation is unbearable, but the sacrifice of life is bearable. When such an striver becomes unable to bear the relaxation of even a single moment, the Lord has to appear, then because his interest, love and devotion in the Lord is at the top of intensity. At the time when the intense desire is created in the devotional song and meditation or his remembrance becomes intense, the Lord cannot check Himself without meeting him. He can approach him in a moment. This is the best last moment for the attainment of the Supreme Being. When such a restlessness is created the last moment of departing from the body occurs. It is at all impossible to forget the Lord. Not only the great restlessness in the forgetfulness of the Lord, but he cannot survive without the devotional song, contemplation, remembrance and meditation of the Lord; the devotional song, remembrance and contemplation is the breath of his life, even dearer than life. As the breathing continues in the natural way, no pain is felt, but it is painful to check the breath. Similarly, the devotional song and contemplation of the Lord in the natural way is like the natural breathing, no effort is needed to perform it. Such a man gives more importance to the contemplation and devotional song in His praise than even the Lord, for such a man the Lord cannot check Himself, He appears in a moment.</p>
<p class="Text">We generally mutter the Lord’s name, meditate on His form, that is not important. Our mind is generally not concentrated at all, but we mutter the Lord’s name like a forced service, there are some who feel it a labour and there are some who do it like taking the medicine unwillingly, who are bound to take the medicine they also sing the devotional song in compulsion. Actually, that is not the devotional song at all, that is not the muttering of the Lord’s name. if we remember the Lord’s name or sing in His praise to cure ourselves from the disease of birth and death and for the purpose of our sins to be destroyed, then the love and devotion etc. in the Lord is secondary. In-spite of it the devotional song in His praise, His contemplation and the muttering of His name has the capacity to get the Lord attained. So, we should develop love in the Lord, sing devotional song in His praise, contemplate Him and mutter His name with the motive to attain the Lord. ‘Bhajan’ word has a wide meaning. The congregational singing and the muttering of Lord’s name is called devotional song (Bhajan). We sing the virtues of Hari in His praise which is called ‘Hariyash’, that is also called devotional song (Bhajan).</p>
<p class="Text">There is the device for the ‘Japa’ (muttering of Lord’s name) also. First, we don’t know the device at all. The emotion and attitude is more important than device by which the ‘Japa’ (muttering) itself goes on carrying importance. On one hand we make the ‘Jap’ (muttering) important and on the next hand ‘Japa’ (muttering) itself becomes valuable. Our effort to make it valuable is very slow. We perform the muttering by the pronunciation, that muttering in which it is not pronounced but muttered in the mind is better than this ‘Japa’ or muttering, it is not audible to others but only the shaking of lips is visible to others. Our tongue also moves and our lips also move but it is heard to the self very slowly and slowly, but it is not heard to others. If any one very close to us gives his ears very close to the mouth, probably it may be heard also to him; that is called ‘Upanshu Jap’.  Even in comparison to this that ‘Japa’ (muttering) is superior in which even the lips don’t move, the ‘Japa’ (muttering) remains being performed only by the tongue inside and the ‘Japa’ (muttering) performed with the throat only even better than this, it is related to our life force and breath. The practice of ‘Japa’ (muttering) by taking the breath is more important than the ‘Japa’ (muttering) practiced by tongue. And even superior to this also is the muttering in mind only.</p>
<p class="Text">There are many kinds of the ‘Mental Japa’. First, when we are in the state of asleep, on very minute observation in the ear like ticking sound of the watch and according to the pulse-rate that word is heard and we relate it with the Name, it means ‘Rama’, ‘Shiv’ or any other name whosoever is our deity we connect the relation of His name with it. Now, as how many times the word is heard so many times the Lord’s name is connected with it. Later on the sound of the Lord’s name is experienced by him apparently. Thus, the ‘Japa’ (muttering) remains related to the mind only. If the mind is absent the name will not be heard. In the same way the ‘Japa’ (muttering) is practiced by the pulse also. In the ‘Patanjali’s text on Yoga’ it has been stated that the ‘Shushumna Nari’ is present from the heart to the brain. Being concentrated in the heart by meditation this vein looks moving. By the special concentration to the mind, eyebrow and throat that vein is visible by making its speed fast it becomes visible clearly. This is also a type of ‘Mental Japa’. As in case anyone is the worshipper of ‘Rama’s’ name and having written ‘Ra’ and ‘Ma’ on the wall he is reading it again and again, he is watching ‘Ra’ and ‘Ma’ with the sight of mind, he is contemplating the ‘Name’ with his concentrated mind, that is the muttering by mind. Whosoever the deity is–as someone meditates only the Lord Rama; mutters only Rama’s name and remains seeing it having written the name of Lord Rama on his forehead with the sandal paste or having written it on his crown. This is even much better.</p>
<p class="Text">He, who is the worshipper of Absolute truth, the Supreme Being without form and attribute and he does not worship ‘Sakar’ (the manifested form with attributes) by him the words indicating the formless Supreme Being–as <span class="char-style-override-6">ॐ</span> (Om), ‘Tat,’ ’Sat’, ‘Anant’ (eternal), ‘Sama’ etc., is remembered by the resolve of his mind. So many matters remain revolving in our memory; they are resolved and cannot be expressed by the speech. He doesn’t say at all so in this way that it comes to the memory of his mind, it is contemplated by him or he remembers them. Thus, the repeated memory of the Lord’s name in the mind is the remembrance by mind. By remembering the Lord by mind in this way he who neither tells anyone, nor makes known to anyone, neither gives any indication nor discloses it before others, but does it with secret mind, this is even more good. Thus, by remembering the ‘Name’ secretly in his mind he remembers the Named also along with His name. As the worshipper of Lord Rama’s name on His lotus face, on His checks, on his head, on His forehead, near His ears–all around everywhere he remains seeing the Lord Rama and goes on muttering His name also in his mind and also remains looking Lord Rama’s lotus face. Thus, both of these are going on together. The ‘Japa’ (muttering) and meditation both are in process jointly. As on the lotus face of Lord Rama the word ‘Rama’, Rama is written with the paste of sandal, he, himself, is remembering it, remembering it in his mind and looking His lotus face also. His feeling is that the Lord closes His eyes, that is also the pronunciation of Lord’s name and while opening and while closing even the pronunciation of Lord’s name is also being made, as if the Lord’s eyes also were pronouncing ‘Rama-Rama’. When the Lord speaks or laughs even then there is the pronunciation of Lord’s name. Thus, the muttering and meditation both are being done together. If there is anyone, the worshipper of Absolute truth then he should take it in this way—In our body each and every nerve is working in natural way, it should be connected with muttering, and it should be realized that the muttering is being performed in the natural way and it is being realized by the mind. This is also the muttering by mind.</p>
<p class="Text">All the pores of the body are thrilled with joy, so they have bloomed as if the pronunciation of ‘Rama’s’ name is being made by each and every hair of the body, the consciousness is feeling delighted. By the Lord’s grace as if by every root of the hair the pronunciation of Lord’s name is being made. When there is thrilling in the body, the roots of the hairs open; it appears so in the mind as if by each and every hair of the body it were being pronounced ‘Rama-Rama’. Such a realization in the mind is ‘the muttering of mind’ of the higher category. After doing such muttering to keep it secret is of greater importance. Here there are interest and love together. The faith and devotion—both of these are verily there. Because, without faith and devotion it is not even possible at all to be done so. Even without love it is not possible. So, also it is difficult to say here that if the adoration is made with love and devotion even its category can be higher. Such a condition occurs with love and devotion only. When such a condition is created by devotion, love, interest and attachment, he attains such a perfect peace and immense joy that is beyond limit. This joy and peace is got due to love and devotion only. This is the ‘Japa’ (muttering) of higher category. Here also, so long as there is the feeling of doership, there is lack. The absence of the feeling of doership in the doer is more important than that even because by such a man free from the sense of ‘I’ the ‘Japa’ (muttering) is done in the natural way without effort. The ‘Jap’ (muttering) practised in the natural way without effort is more important. When such a ‘Japa’ (muttering) begins to be practised in natural way constantly and regularly, no mistake of even a moment is possible then and when the ‘Japa’ (muttering) starts being practised  constantly, the Lord then appears only by the influence of the ‘Japa’ (muttering) because along with his muttering there is the remembrance of the form also there. Whether he is the worshipper of the Lord of the manifested form with attributes or of the supreme consciousness without any form and attributes who take interest in this ‘Japa’ (muttering) gets relish in it, feels delighted and a great joy considers this natural Japa of the Lord’s name with love more important thus his sight, and he only wants that such a ‘Japa’ (muttering) may remain continuing forever.</p>
<p class="Text">By the flaw or lapse in the continuity the need is created. But when there is no such lack in continuity then how a desire crops up as it is continually going on. In other words so long as there is the feeling of doership there is craving. When then is no slackness of continuity, how will the need be created, that is already continuing. This craving is also of very higher category. There is no blemish in this desire. Later on their craving also does not exist. When it comes in usual practice, there remains no possibility of any flaw, it continues, then why should the craving exist? Desire is created in some lack, or in fear lest it should be extinct. There is neither any fear nor any scarcity. So, there is no reason of the creation of desire. When God is standing before our eyes then there is no desire to meet the Lord. Became when the Lord is already attained, there is no reason to cherish the desire to meet him, but there is an apprehension that the God may not disappear, may not be hidden. Then there is a desire that the same situation may continue. He who has such a feeling who is apparently enjoying such a joy in remembering the Lord’s name, how can it be given up by him? There is no reason at all to be given up. The Lord, himself, is blessing us with His vision but he can disappear in the middle while giving the sight, that is beyond our capacity, but the ‘Japa’ (muttering) what is being practised by us cannot be given up in the same way as we cannot survive when our breathing is stopped. This is our life and even more then our life. He whom the devotional song in the praise of the Lord appears more valuable than his life even can sacrifice his life but cannot leave remembering the Lord’s name. Similarly the same happens in the restlessness of separation. The restlessness at separation means in the restlessness of the Lord’s separation in it meditation has its priority. In the first method there is the provision of the Japa also and meditation also and in the separation also there are the both Japa and meditation, but in the first by the regular practice of ‘Japa’ the meditation accrues, so, there is the priority of the muttering of the Name. But in separation by the power of meditation the Lord’s name also remains fresh in our mind. While muttering the Lord’s name excessively if our mind in concentrated to meditation, then after meditation the restlessness of separation can also be possible. There are separate methods for all the practices differently; there is no single method applicable to all.</p>
<p class="Text">How to meditate upon God for this purpore there is the method of meditation. Suppose, any one is the devotee of the Lord Rama and he is in practice of meditating upon the Lord Rama. The method is being explained. The Lord is standing in front of him. The devotee first concentrated his mind to the Lord’s feet having concentrated his mind he got charmed that the Lord’s feet were very charming and tender and even in the feet the fingers of the feet were extra ordinary charming the light of the nails were gleaming more distinctly. Thus Lord Rama’a feet are tender, charming, brightening, and attractive. Similarly are His both calf of leg, knees, and thigh. He has wrapped His body with ‘Pitamber’ (yellow cloth). The Pitamber (yellow cloth) is extremely shining on His body. His waist is slender. His navel is like lotus, there are three folds on His belly. The garland of flowers is looking graceful. He is wearing the garland of pearls and jewels also. The Lord has two arms. His right hand is assuming arrow and there is bow in His left hand which string is hanging on his shoulder. On His back there is quiver fully equipped with arrows which is called case of arrows. The Lord’s chest is broad. The arms are long touching His knees, His arm is corpulent in the upper part and thin in the lower part, it looks very handsome as if any prince of Sixteen years, such is the age of the Lord. As if the Lord were moving about in the guise of a prince in the garden of Janakpur. His finger is adorned with ring and hand with bracelet, His neck is very attractive. His chin is shining and His lips are glittering like red gem. The rows of His teeth are shining like the rows of white pearls; He is smiling as if His face were blossomed like the rose flower. His speech is very sweet, serene, soft meaningful, pleasing and attracting the mind and dear like nectar to the ears. A very pleasant scented smell is spreading from His body and by the touch of His body is thrilled. His view is very pleasant to the eyes. His nose is an extraordinary beautiful and His cheeks are very shining and his glimpse is of rosy color. He is wearing in the ears the bejewelled golden ear-rings of the crocodile shape. His ears are very beautiful and His both the eyes are open as if the two lotus flowers are bloomed. His eye brows are very charming and his forehead is shining. The numberless merits of his forgiveness, mercy, Peace, equanimity, contentment, simplicity, knowledge and renunciation etc., are developing outside through His eyes and His mouth is completely bloomed, the hair on head are shining brightly. There is a crown of gold studded with gems on his head. Perceiving Him so whatever his merits and virtues are in Him are appearing apparently. Being established in the sky the Lord is showering the rain of His noble virtues through His eyes on us. He is pouring down the stock of his noble virtues and the ocean of His virtues in our hearts. Those noble virtues are developing and spreading in the whole wide world through his eyes and we too are getting obsessed in the ocean of his virtues. We are getting charmed to see such a lovely and charming appearance of the Lord. The charm of his appearance is even more than the charm of cupid, even the charm of crores of cupids together cannot compare to the charm of his appearance, such beautiful appearance of the Lord is attracting as if the Lord were enchanting us, Lord’s sight touch, speech conversation, contemplation—all these are like nectar, source of joy, lovely and delicious, we are enjoying the supernatural taste and getting charmed. But such a concentration is at times, this is a general thing. Even higher than this is the constant memory of the lord’s unworldly influence along with, His charming appearance in the meditation. The memory of the characters should be there. The merits are already connected with the character. As the Lord is acting any frolicsome activity. He is trying to do any play of any kind. Having visited the hermitages of the sages the Lord in talking to them, that is what is softness, sweetness in this speech and what is super naturality in his behavior that is full of compassion, full of love. His visit to them is only for their interest He has nothing any Self-interest. His visit is only for their love for their devotion and for the good of the beings of the world only. From time to time such realization and at the particular time if such memory remains continuing, then this is the common meditation of the Lord. The meditation what is even more than thus is the meditation made often, there remains constant. There is no possibility of flaw there. If any mistake ever committed, he becomes completely restless, he fails to bear it while moving anywhere while sitting standing, eating-drinking evey moment his mind remains concentrated and any solitary place the mind is specially concentrated to the Lord and at the rest time the mental concentration to the Lord remains in general. This is the prime meditation of the Lord. But when it comes to advance stage the meditation of the Lord always remains equal in the mind. Whether he meditates on the Lord-sitting in any solitary place or while in movement or eating-drinking sitting standing any moment the charming image of the Lord does not detach from his heart at all. As for example, the image of Lord Krishna never goes away from the heart of the Gopis. There is the exclusive devotion, exclusive love exclusive mental concentration, and exclusive contemplation exclusive remembrance when we reach the more advance stage then even this stage the devotee is so much absorbed and charmed with the meditation that he never gets detached. Then he doesn’t meditate upon God, automatically the mind remains concentrated in the meditation, he cannot avoid it, it is beyond his capacity to leave it. Such a meditation remains being practised in the natural way automatically. Then, at that time he considers that meditation is more important than the apparent view of the Lord even. He doesn’t have the longing that the Lord should appear before him apparently. In reality, he gives the most priority to his meditation. He remains charmed with his meditation at all times. He has no exigency if the Lord is interested He may come and favour him with His sight. Between both of them who has deep love, who gives more importance to love will have greater need, He will be bound to come. What is the need to a devotee? Similar is the restlessness of separation but it is another line. In the restlessness of separation the practice of meditation is the same but he wants the direct vision of the God, he feels excessively restless in the absence of his sight. As the husband of the lady of blooming youth is in distant country and she feels restless also from time to time in the separation of her husband of  and weeps also. Such restlessness is general. In the restlessness of the Lord’s separation the mind can never take rest even for a moment as was the restless condition of Bharataji in the separation of the Lord, when such condition reached the climax—</p>
<p class="Shlok">राम बिरह सागर महँ भरत मगन मन होत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">बिप्र रूप धरि पवन सुत आइ गयउ जनु पोत॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Uttarakanda</span> 1-A)</p>
<p class="Text">‘While Bharat’s mind was thus sinking in the ocean of Separation from Shri Rama, the son of the wind-god Shri Hanumanji disguised as a Brahman, came like a bark to his rescue? And he informed him that the Lord Shri Rama was approaching near along with Lakshmanji and Sitaji. At that time Bharatji’s joy surpassed even the joy of that thirsty man who is made to drink the nectar. The joy what a writhing fish gets when it is dropped into the water, Bharatji felt even greater joy then that of the fish. These examples don’t conform him really there is no other example that may be compared to him.</p>
<p class="Text">When the Lord Krishna disappeared, the Gopis being excessively restless in the separation remained searching out him in the forest. This is the restlessness of superior grade. When the restlessness reached to its climax and they were about to dip, then the Lord appeared. In the restlessness of the Lord’s separation when the mind may not take rest at all, then there is no interest of taking meal, sleep in the night nothing may appeal to the mind, eating and drinking nothing may satisfy the mind, no other object except the Lord only may not be pleasant to the mind, in such a condition the lord cannot cheek himself He appears at once, first, the common meditation was explained then later on for such a meditation no extra effort is required, its practice remains continuing automatically, that is the higher category of meditation. Till now the restlessness in separation and impatience in love, the both were on equal scale. From here the line of the both changed.</p>
<p class="Text">The lover was overwhelmed by the charm of the Joy and wants only meditation, he does not want God and the restless one in separation wants the apparent view of the Lord. If the God doesn’t appear, He cannot bear it. In the separation the restlessness is overpowering and in the love the joy is overpowering. Everywhere there are set examples for these. As in the obsession of love there are Prahlad, Sutikshna. In the ‘Ramayan’ written by Tulasidas the form and feature what has been described, according to that he became ecstatic in the meditation of the Lord, Rama. Even on the arrival of Rama he did not want to detach his mind from the meditation of God. He is valuing the meditation greater than the vision of the Lord Rama. As Surdasji says—‘Make me blind again so that your meditation only may remain continuing and I want nothing. As Prahlad remained intoxicated in, muttering and meditation of the Lord, he doesn’t pray to the Lord for His approach even. Those who are getting charmed in the Lord’s love and meditation peace and bliss, don’t have desire even of the vision of Lord. The Lord, Himself visits uncalled.</p>
<p class="Text">The path of restlessness in the separation is as the path of Bharatji. He is so much restless in separation that he cannot survive until the Lord approaches him. The Gopis are so much restless in separation that they cannot remain alive until the Lord comes. The Lord reached on the occasion of Rukmini’s wedding ceremony and brought her seated in the chariot. If he had not reached, Rukmini would have sacrifised her life being restless excessively due to separation. The Goddess Sita is so much restless in the ‘Ashokvatika’ of Ravan that if the Lord had not reached there she could not have remained alive. In the same way wherever the reference of restlessness comes these matters should be understood well.</p>
<p class="Text">Similarly, the man who is overwhelmed with joy and charmed, there the Lord’s meditation appears to him more beneficial than his ‘Darshan’ (view). In reality the Lord’s apparent manifested appearance is much higher than his meditation, but at that time he remains so much absorbed in meditation of the Lord, and considers the meditation so higher and remains so much confident that as he is fond of the Lord so the Lord is also of me. He cannot approach the God but the God can approach him is doubtless what is the need for him to call Him? He is bound to come himself where there is love.</p>
<p class="Text">Till now I have narrated about the Lord’s love and narrated something about the restlessness of His separation also. Now something is being said about the craving to meet the Lord also—</p>
<p class="Text">In meeting God the muttering of Lord’s name and the meditation on His form are the direct means, similarly, the eagerness to attain him is not less in any way but it can be said that this is better than those. As by the adoration, by meditation, by association with great souls the love in the Lord deepens, similarly, by the desire to meet the Lord also and our love to the Lord grows more and more and by the love in the God only, our desire to meet Him is created, this is reciprocal. As by dispassion in the heart, the practice of the spiritual discipline becomes fast, and by the fast practice of spiritual discipline the feeling of renunciation is created, similarly by the fast practice of spiritual discipline the Love is developed in God and with development of love in God, the spiritual discipline gets momentum. If we say that the ‘Japa’ and meditation are not needed as much as the desire to meet the Lord is needed, eagerness is needed, but if there is the eagerness to meet the Lord, the adoration and meditation will be practised naturally. So it can be said that there should be intense desire to meet the lord. The intensity of eagerness to meet the Lord is the main means to attain the Lord. There is one the common wish to attain the Lord, the second is the secondary wish and the third one is the intense longing to attain the Lord. Thus, there are different kinds of longings Nowadays most of the people remain very much fond of the worldly objects of enjoyment like gold, and charming ladies, honour, praise, fame, dignity, reputation, physical comforts and to enjoy the sensual enjoyments is on prionty and the desire to meet the Lord is secondany. Because a number of men so think that to meet the Lord is very difficult. So they are getting disappointed. There are so many who are atheist, they have no faith in God and think that there is no existence of God, Neither He has even been attained nor can be attained in future, all such discussions are worthless, they can never cherish such desire. Those who are atheist have no faith in His existence why will they wish to meet the Lord? And those who believe in God that there is the existence of God but they think that they are incapable and they are weak and those who have faith in the God. He can be attained but they feel themselves helpless due to lack of spiritual discipline, they are weak and due to this they become disappointed, but here, they are at fault. Why should we look towards ourselves? We should be attentive towards the Lord, towards the vow of the Lord we should see the Lord’s disposition. He who sees towards the Lord’s and believes in him is never disappointed. As Bharatji says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन अवगुन प्रभु मान न काऊ। </p>
<p class="Shlok">दीन बंधु अति मदुल सुभाऊ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 7/1/6)</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The Lord never minds the errors of his devotees, His nature is very kind. He is friendly to the humble only being confident of his such nature Bharatji has such sense and confidence that God will be attained to him. Even when a longing to the extent grows that he cannot survive without meeting the Lord It should be so in the love of the God that the God’s separation may be unbearable even for a moment and it may become difficult to remain alive. When such a condition is created it is called deeper intensity. When the desire to meet comes to the climax of intensity the lord appears at the very moment and he cannot stop. If the Lord does not appear for moment, the life cannot survive. There should be the intensity to meet the Lord, the Lord cannot delay at all He may come even when there is the deeper intensity of desire  but if the intensity reaches its climax he cannot stay even for a moment. Thus, I narrated you the intensity of restlessness.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Profound secret</p>
<p class="Text">There are two kinds of great souls—one who follows the path of salvation through devotion and the other one is he who follows the path of knowledge leading to beatitude. Those who have realized the absolute truth, the Supreme Being, Brahma are omnipresent like Sachchidanand (the Supreme Being). As the Supreme Being Brahma can appear in the manifested form everywhere at the same time exactly in the same way they can also manifest themselves. </p>
<p class="Shlok">हरि व्यापक सर्वत्र समाना। </p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रेम तें प्रगट होहिं मैं जाना॥</p>
<p class="Text">'The Lord is omnipresent. As I know he appears everywhere everytime subject to love.'</p>
<p class="Text">Those who believe and know this principle well, for them the Lord Himself appears in the same form of Shiv, Rama etc., whatever form of the Lord they want to see like the Shiv, Rama in the form of that great soul also. The followers of the path of devotion, the great souls also are same in the union with the Lord even though they look apart from the Lord. The creator of the living beings—the Supreme Bing with form and attributes appears in the manifested form of a exalted soul before that devotee. The Lord fulfils the duty of the devotee. There are several such instances The Lord serves the purpose in the disguised form of a barber etc. To hear such instances the devotee feels sometimes exhilarated and sometime the thought comes to his mind that the Lord had to do such a work.</p>
<p class="Text">The same spiritual truth about the both has been stated whether he realises the formless supreme consciousness without attributes or he who has attained the lord endowed with form and attributes. So many such matters related to the spiritual truth are not found in the books. The question is how many such matters will be there in the books? There is no end of such subject matters? Such feelings and sentiments, which are created in the minds of the great souls according to the time and place, who should write them and what should be the limit for them to write? The both who have accomplished the realization of the Absolute Truth either by following the path of worship of the formless supreme Brahma leading to the beatitude through knowledge or who have followed the path of salvation through the devotion of the Lord with form and attributes, attain the same state in the last. First, devotee realizes God in accordance of his views who worships God in His Form with attributes he realizes God in form of attributes and who worships the attributeless or formless God, he realizes the attributeless form. The ultimate fruit of all forms of worship is the same but it is nit describable</p>
<p class="Text">The fruit of the worship of ‘Nirgun’ is the attainment of the perfect Supreme Being, Brahma and the negativity of the world in its entirety in all the three times—present past and future. This is the doctrine of world being never born. This is its last fruit.</p>
<p class="Text">The fruit of the worship of ‘Sagun’ (with form and attributes)—is the direct vision of the most beloved worshipped deity. Here achievement of the fruit is according to the worship in terms of diversity.</p>
<p class="Text">Where is one and the same fruit of both the types of worshippers, there is some strange than unity and diversity that cannot be expressed by any way.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who has attained the Lord by following any path has no selfish motive at all there is not even the scent of the desire of honour, praise, repute and goodwill due to the absense of egoism. There remains the behaviour of equanimity—there is the equality in real sense. The honour, and dishonour, condemnation and appreciation, friend and foe earth and gold all are tested equally on the same standard of equality by all the ways. The characteristics of the men who have realized God through the path of devotion have been mentioned in the 12th chapter of Gitaji, in the 14th chapter there are the characteristics of great souls who have risen above the three gunas in the second and the sixth chapters there are mentioned the characteristics of the perfect beings who have realized God through Karmayoga and in the fifth chapter the chactaristics of those who have realized the truth through Gyanayoga. All have been tested on the touchstone of equality. So such men are free even from the scent of honour, fame and good will. They never desire adoration of their pictures even when they are alive or dead. If any exalted soul has such desire then he is not a great soul in the real sense.</p>
<p class="Text">This is the matter of serious observation—those who have realized the existence, consciousness and bliss solidified God through the worship of attributesles and formless God, there is no egoistic feeling in them. Then how can there be any wish in them? In view of those who have realized the Absolute Brahma, Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Shiv etc., all such incarnations are His own. Somewhere here and there the enlightened souls have even said that ‘It is I to shine so brightly in the form of the Sun etc.’ This is the utterance of an enlightened soul considering himself as Brahma. He neither wants to get his body to be worshipped, nor his name or form nor he wants to leave any such impression on his followers that He should be worshipped after his death. Whatever the fame of the names and forms of Rama, Krishna etc., is he thinks the fame of his own self. If Lord Rama is glorified anywhere, he considers it his own glory. If anyone is being condemned he thinks that it is he who is being condemned. But he remains completely untainted from this condemnation or praise this is stated only to be understood, it is stated for the inquisitive only. There is no meditation of the great soul separate from that of Brahma. If the worshipper of the attributeless God meditates upon the great soul as apart from Brahma, it means he does not understand the Tattva of that exalted soul. The renown of the Brahma is his own renown.</p>
<p class="Text">From the devotion point of view God and the realized great soul are like water and ice, it means that the both are of the same essence. As ice, water, cloud and fog all are the same, only one element. Whether ‘Nirgun’ or ‘Sagun’ the both are the same Lord only. If the follower of ‘Sagun’ criticizes ‘Nirgun’, he criticizes only the same Lord or Supreme Being. All aspects of God are in its entirety as integral Brahma. If anyone worships that devotee or glorifies him he feels shame with the view of devotion, He feels that worship and honour a blemish for himself. He feels and ponders over ‘How is this worship to me in presence of the Lord? Indeed, I am being insulted, it is better for me to be killed, because there is none more handsome than the Lord, there is none more influential than He. He is the ocean of virtues. Even the combined virtues of all devotees are only a drop of that ocean. How charming is the name of my deity! The body of our deity is supernatural. The devotee—the exalted soul condsiders the worship of his character, form or his virtues blemish for himself. He leaves the same impact on others also. If anyone worships him gives him more honour and importance, he treats him a fool or child only. Actually such a pious soul always remains without any blot on him, but we are stigmatizing him, we don’t really realize his glory.</p>
<p class="Text">This will not be available in the books. The followers of the great souls till today have often exaggerated the glory of their reverent great souls. Really, they could not understand the essential truth of the great souls.</p>
<p class="Text">Actually, the great souls cannot admit that by adoring their body, virtues, influence etc., would lead to their redemption. There is no sense of ego. If anyone thinks so himself, he is not really a great soul. If any such instance comes in view anywhere then it should be realized that it is beyond our understanding. If we test it on the touchstone of logic then no great soul will prove. The activities and behaviors are verily illusory. The real fact cannot come to the mind of the men in delusion. We cannot prove it by outer behaviour and action. In a drama, the actor imitates only the same role of the character what he has to play on the stage. According to the acting of the role he has to weep somewhere and laugh somewhere and sometimes he has to show his anger also. If we think that really he is angry, it is not right. Suppose, the father is acting the role of the minister and the son is in the role of the king, the king is expressing his anger on the minister, but that anger is expressed for the minister and not for the father. In reality there is nothing like anger even there is merely the sportive display. In the same way, all the actions and behaviours are performed according to the angles of circumstances. The Lord Rama wails in lamentation. Sitaji weeps in lamentation. Bharatji is overjoyed to meet Hanumanji. Vedavyasji is running after his son, he expresses his grief, but where is the room for anguish and attachment there? <span class="char-style-override-4">‘तत्र को मोह: क: शोक:’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-5">Isha.</span> 7) So, decision cannot be taken on the basis of the actions’.  He who would be a fraudulent fellow can do the best possible good deed to show. But such great souls having already realized the spiritual truth, are completely free from attachment and aversion. Although in the practical behaviour such activation are done but inwardly to think ill of anyone cannot be possible even by an ordinary spiritual seeker. </p>
<p class="Text">As the mother is annoyed with her child but that is only momentary, like-wise the anger of the spiritual aspirant is momentary, not lasting. The anger of the strivers is like the line drawn on the surface of water which goes on being effaced. The anger of the common men is like the line made on sand which is removed by the gust of wind.</p>
<p class="Text">The anger of the mean person is like the indelible mark on the stone or on the iron. The mean persons remain hostile even based on the hostility of their parent and grandfather, But the anger of the great soul is like the line drawn in the sky. As to make the line in the sky it is only the hand that moves what is visible but no line is formed in the sky at all.</p>
<p class="Text">The great souls always remain cheerful-there is the natural cheerfulness. To weep is the mimetic performance in accordance with the circumstances. The inequality appears in practical behaviour.</p>
<p class="Text">This inequality is also very important. But it is of two kinds from the attitude of liberality and due to the propriety. The inequality of liberal mind is understood by the people as to give seat to other passenger in the compartment of train or in car, to give the objects of lower quality to the persons of close relation and to give objects of higher quality to others. There is more concession for the other families in comparison to one’s own family, it is partiality but we count it in generosity. When there is the more concession of others then for our ownselves, we treat him as renunciant, generous, noble. This similarity is deliverance providing to the persons devoted to the Lord and glory providing to the great souls.</p>
<p class="Text">As regards propriety, the inequality is not inequality in real sense, that is the justice in fact, but a selfish man takes it as inequality or partiality. There are so many such events as come to our knowledge. There is a past event—Some years ago at the time of famine in Rajputana the relief was being given with the money collected by the members of the religious congregation. The grain was being sold at the cheap rate. The businessman there were going in loss. On this issue the residents of Churu were divided into two parties. The gentlemen who were serving wrote to me that they were in a fix what to do because, one party was agitating. I wrote—Try your best to satisfy the both. There is the question of only money. Give the cereals to the shop-keepers also at a bit cheaper rate in comparison to the common public. They said that the shopkeepers take it as a sin to do so. They want that this work should be stopped. At last, it was decided to stop such work creating the feeling of attraction and repulsion. By doing so it would prove to be beneficent, but if it is creating the feeling of attachment and aversion there, if it is not done, that is not   causing any harm. When the work was almost stopped, some of my friends, and others attending the religious discourses wrote—You are afraid of reproach and don’t pay your attention to the good of the thousands. Suppose, the shop continues, no doubt, the others abuse yet there is a binding to stand with any one party. We cannot remain indifferent. In the Last world war the other countries sharing the war asked Turkey not to allow her to remain neutral and ask her it either to favour the Germans or to fight against. In such a situation if Turkey is to fight thus despite maintaining equality it may have to fight.</p>
<p class="Text">The second instance is that in our clan there are two groups. It is essential to stand with any one either of the two, It is must to quit either of the two. Thus, by the behavior according to the propriety, the people take it as the partial behavior they imagine there attachment and aversion. The great souls are hundreds of miles away from the attraction and repulsion. But the other common people whose interest suffers see it through the eyes of attachment and aversion. There comes before me the complicated cases to get them settled. The justice is favoured. But he who suffers he loss of money, blames for partiality. The dispenser of justice does not appear good to him. He by whom the self interest is killed becomes his enemy.</p>
<p class="Text">The discrimination made due to the generosity doesn’t prick to our mind, but the people misunderstand even the equanimity as discrimination if it is based on ethics. There are some places where the discrimination based on ethics or policy is accepted as equanimity. As when we receive the telegrama of mother’s illness, at that time there remains no equality with the telegrama given on some man’s illness. There is discrimination in practice but there is equality. It is justice there. As much we are indebted to our mother so much she has right on me. The other brothers don’t have that right on us, the dissimilarity remains but it is equality. </p>
<p class="Text">As a matter of fact there is only the feeling of equanimity in the heart of great souls whether the people praise or condemn the equality of behaviour. What is the loss or gain to the great soul here?</p>
<p class="Text">The gentlemen coming here to attend the religious congregation think as if they were doing good to that great soul, they generally say that ‘I was about to come day before yesterday but due to some urgent piece of work I could not come.’ Why do they indicate so? If he didn’t come what was the loss of that saint?</p>
<p class="Text">There is an instance a king ordered his subjects to loot the treasury. The people gathered there and began to loot the treasury. A man could not go there for two days. On the third day, he said to the cashier—‘I could not come for two days, please, excuse me.’ The cashier says—‘It was better that you did not come, if you had come, you also would have added to the rush.’ You have not come to do some good to me.</p>
<p class="Text">In the same way, anyone says—‘Mahatmaji! I come to attend your discourses daily.’ Mahatmaji says—‘It is your great kindness.’ He understands that the Mahatmaji will be very much pleased with him for attending his discourses. It is a matter of consideration whether the people go to attend the religious congregation for their own gain or to please the Mahatma.</p>
<p class="Text">People work for thirty days. Whether they get salary or not? They will remain gainer so many days they do their duty. We imagine that our attendance will provide fame and glory to the Mahatma. What will be our gain by such imagination? We don’t say it openly but we realize it in our mind. If we approach any noble soul for his virtuous company, we should not have this opinion in our mind we are obliging him. This is the reason why we suffer from the more gain. We have this opinion in our mind that they are eager of honour, and repute; that is why we give such clarifications. Otherwise we would not say so. The noble men laugh at our ignorance for uttering such words. Our visit there indicates our shallow mentality-mean mentality that is why we are not fully benefitted. As much big pot we have with us so much Gangajal we can bring for us. With however noble sentiment we may approach them there is a potentiality of developing a more noble sentiment If our feeling is very pious and higher, our redemption is possible immediately. Suppose we have to fill in an earthen pot, if we drop a little water regularly in it, it will take a long time to fill it. It we bring water from the tap it will be filled in a single day and if we take the pot on the bank of the Ganga, it can be filled at once.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">In reality if there is really any great soul, we can take the same advantage by his company what we can take from the company of the Lord. By the company of the servants of the servants of great soul we can get our desired fruit. The same profit what we can get by the apparent view of the Lord. We can take the same profit by approaching any great soul only once.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">The spiritual striver’s attitude towards the great soul and love to the Lord</p>
<p class="Text">In reality, there are a very few such great souls who know God in reality. Hardly there is one among the lakhs and crores The Lord Himself says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये। </p>
<p class="Shlok">यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 7/3)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Hardly one among thousands of men strives to realize Me, of those striving Yogis, again, some rare one, devoting himself exclusively to Me know Me in reality.’ </p>
<p class="Text">The great soul knows God in reality is the only one great soul in real sense. The traits and virtues of great soul are available in the scriptures in abundance. As it is stated in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> in brief—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्रः करुण एव च। </p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः समदुःखसुखः क्षमी॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">सन्तुष्टः सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढ़निश्चयः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 12/13-14)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He who is free from all malice towards all beings, friendly and compassionate and, rid of the feelings of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ balanced in joy and sorrow, forgiving by nature, ever contented and mentally united with Me nay, who has subdued his mind, senses and body, has a firm resolve and has surrendered his mind and reason to Me—that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, the true devotee of God who is free from malice towards anyone and is friendly and compassionate to all free from selfish motive as God is selfless friend of all beings so is the great soul. He is balanced in the both, joy and sorrow. He remains Free from the attachment of wife son and body and egotism—the feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. He is of forgiving nature—he never suffers from the feeling of revenge at all howsoever anyone may cause him loss, or harm. He remains always cheerful being united with the Lord. He is of firm resolve and self restraint and he has surrerdered himself with mind and reason to the Lord. That is why the Lord said to Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय। </p>
<p class="Shlok">निवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 12/8)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Arjuna therefore, fix your mind on Me, and establish your intellect in Me alone; thereafter you will abide solely in Me. There is no doubt about it.’</p>
<p class="Text">This is the spiritual discipline and the characteristies of the perfect being have been mentioned above in the 13th and 14th verses twelfth chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>. Thus, the devotee devoted exclusively to the Lord with his mind and reason attains the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Hardly one among the lakhs and cores of men strives to realize the Lord and someone rare of those striving Yogis is really a great soul who knows the truth. First the great souls in the real sense are rare in the world and they are approachable only to the most fortunate men or as the fruit of their selfless actions done by them in the past. Those actions provide their fruit here., because the fruit of the unselfish deeds is to free from the bond of birth and death. It has been stated in <span class="char-style-override-5">Ramayana</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">पुन्य पुंज बिनु मिलहिं न संता।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्संगति संसृति कर अंता॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘The actions with selfish motive melt away after providing their fruit. The saints and great souls cannot be approachable to the persons of selfish actions The company of such great souls frees us completely from the realm of birth and death. First it is very difficult to find them but anyhow if they are approached, nothing is impossible. But when in case we succeed in meeting them it is difficult at the first instance to recognize them and know them because in the world all the men are similar in look, there is not any external mark of identification to distinguish that he is the true great soul and even there may be any such identification possible then, so many other false and fraudulent saints will stand in row. Really, if we get such true exalted soul by chance and we may know them and recognize them then its fruit will be infallible. Infallible means their company never proves worthless.</p>
<p class="Text">The doubt is created in the mind if such a great soul becomes available anyhow there how to take maximum advantage from him? There is no such example to explain it, because whatever the worldly examples are quoted, they are scanty. Then what is the solution?</p>
<p class="Text">If anyone happens to get the philosopher’s stone, what is his duty?  If the gainer of the philosopher’s stone is just and intelligent, he will try to make the whole world rich by transforming the iron into gold with that stone otherwise he is fool why will he leave anyone poor? There can be given as the second example—Suppose, a criminal suit regarding a very serious offence was filed against anyone. The judge in whose court the suit was filed, was his close friend by chance. Due to this he became over confident to win the case by the God’s mercy—as the case has come under the juirisdiction of our intimate pretend, this is the one sided judgment in his favour—whether he was the culprit or not. The judge is kind and just of the highest category. As the Lord is dispenser of justice also and kind also, similarly, the great souls are also just and kind both. The accused thinks that the honorable judge is his great will-wisher, he is close to him and very intimate to him. Whatever the judgment is given by him that will be certainly in his own interest directly. He became sure that the decision would go in his favour it was dead sure. Likewise if we happen to get a great soul we should determine it at that very moment that our redemption is sure. Undoubtedly there will be salvation because the great soul is always a just judge and side by side he is our intimate friend also.</p>
<p class="Text">A businessman had filed a suit against a money borrower for rupees one thousand. The judge ordered the money borrower to return the loan of his one thousand rupees. The rich man was very much pleased and said that there should be such a judge. The judge is his close friend so he was not expecting justice from him, but really he gave a very good decision.</p>
<p class="Text">After the announcement of the judgment the money borrower said that he did well to give the just decision, but he had no money of one thousand rupees to pay him. You are well acquainted with my poor condition. It is better for you if you yourself manage for one thousand rupee. The judge admitted it and said that his money would be made available at his house you need not beg from anyone. The honourable judge reminded him that he had started a business on his advice in his partnership and there was the profit of two thousand rupees in that business out of which rupees one thousand was his share and the rest one thousand was his own share. Now, he will get his money timely, so don’t worry.</p>
<p class="Text">He said—‘when I came to know that my case was in your court I had became carefree. Thus, that honourable judge paid off his money. After getting his rupees the money lender said—‘Where to find such a judge? I had already made up my mind that he is your friend and would dismiss my suit.’ Thus, he made the opposite party also in his favour. The dispute was also settled and the three united together with love. The Lord’s devotion is also such and the devotion of the great soul is also equally like same. This is merely an example, but basically, there is no example in the whole world about the Supreme Lord and a great soul. Where to bring from and how to explain? We should take only a portion from this that if any great soul is got anyway then we should think that we are fulfilled as regards the spiritual discipline, that will be practised in the natural way without any effort by his grace, there is no difficulty in the spiritual exercise. But the God is attained by virtue of spiritual practice and that constant adoration and meditation will ensue automatically by the grace of great soul. There should be firm faith in the mind about the attainment of the Lord. We are simply the instrument. The ways to achieve the Lord will be followed automatically, there is no question of doubt here.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord, Himself, bears the responsibility of welfare and the great souls too and they use us simply as an instrument. The Lord states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 9/22)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The devotees, however, who solely loving Me, constantly think of Me, and worship Me in a disinterested spirit, to those ever united in thought with Me, I bring full security and personally look after all their needs.’</p>
<p class="Text">The attainment of the unobtained is called Yoga and the security of the attained is called ‘safeguarding’. The Lord states. ‘It is I who fulfill the want in the spiritual practice and I bring full security also, I don’t let it be destroyed.’ If the Lord fulfils then what was there left? The same is in the case of perfect beings also.</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्ये त्वेवमजानन्तः श्रुत्वान्येभ्य उपासते। </p>

<p class="Text"> ‘Other dull-witted persons, however, not knowing thus, worship even as they have heard from others (i.e., the knower’s of truth); and even they who are thus devoted to what they have heard, are able to cross the ocean of mundane existence in the shape of death.’</p>
<p class="Text">The other’s who do not know anything about Yogas of meditation, knowledge, Bhaktiyoga, Karmayoga and have very little knowledge their duty is that they should be devoted to what they have heard but they too approaching the great souls and listening to their discourses and engage in the disciplines by hearing them, cross the ocean by remaining devoted to what they have heard. To be devoted to hearing means to listen with the concentrated mind and having heard it to bring it in practice. It we are confident that our purpose is served by listening to them and then after bringing it in practice in our own life then it will require no extra effort for its practice but it will be automatically practised. The great souls never utter any such thing that will be impracticable and if he says anything impracticable then how is he a Mahatma? Because a true great soul is well acquainted with the capacity and ability of the person and the Lord also knows. The work is allotted to anyone only according to his capacity. The Lord is already well acquainted with our vitality talent and capacity about our nature and energy. So the Lord neither expects more from any one than his capacity nor He commands otherwise to do so. Whatever we possess that is bestowed upon us as the Lord’s gift, nothing is hidden there. Whatever He has blessed you for this attainment He wants to return beck to Him and He gives us concession also for what has been spent by us but we must return what is remaining with us. If we have come to realize it and we fully depend on it then, who will be that fool to leave the Lord who is available to us at such a cheap price? Philosopher’s stone cannot be got to us even after the payment of cores of rupees and if that philosopher’s stone is available to us only on the payment of pennies then the people will rush up to it and the Lord is even more valuable than the Philosopher’s stone, there is no expenditure of an even penny. What really do we have to spend? </p>
<p class="Text">Now the question arises what will be our condition when we have got any great soul and how long will it take to attain the Lord? The answer is that there is no fixed time, the feeling is prime. If we change our bent of mind in a minute, it will take only a minute to attain the Lord and if it is changed is a moment it will take only a moment.</p>
<p class="Text">What is the touch stone to test the change of feeling and attitude? About the touchstone this has already been mentioned earlier in the judgment of the judge-as anyone’s case on the court of his intimate judge, he doesn’t have fear from the judge because the judge is his intimate friend, at the very time he became confident that he would be winner. He would win the case as his case was in the jurisdiction of his friend, his work was almost done and the similar should be our attitude to get a great soul also that he is my closest friend and my case is in his hand, now my victory is sure. Only with the vision of that soul is our victory. We should have the understanding in our mind that everything is under his power it is the attainment of the Lord only is our degree. We should keep it in our mind that the attainment of the Lord is in his hard. As he is a judge, he will allot us some spiritual exercise to be practised for the attainment of the Lord, what is our loss there? If we need reason he will give us reason, if we need strength he will give us strength and he himself provide us the object whatever we need. We are simply an instrument. Doubtlessly, the Lord is attained to us. What is delay here? The delay is only to hear the judgment. There should be eagerness in our mind for the judgment to be given as early as possible. The Judge assured the money lender that the money would be received to him at his house, he should go home. Isn’t it that you are pleased? He says in the pleasant mood—‘Yes, I am highly pleased and he intimated the borrower also about where was the money, he should take it from there and pay it off. He had not to spend the money also from his own pocket. He had no money also with him to give. The money lender got justice and the money borrower got rid of the debt. How to get out of the debt means to get rid of this mortal world.</p>
<p class="Text">I had to settle a dispute of my maternal brother in a ‘Panchayat’. He said to me—‘You are close to me and you have to conduct the ‘Panchayat.’ There is no difference in the money whether it is yours or mine, so give your decision as may please the opposite party, here lies your dignity. His behavior was beyond my expectation. I asked the claimant–‘Tell me honestly what money are you to get?’ He put up his claim of the money. I asked him repeatedly—‘Is it the proper amount? Are you telling me the exact amount or not? He said—‘I am telling what the exact amount is.’ I asked him to receive the amount at this very time. He said that he had no hope of such a decision. He said that he was expecting only the half of the amount of his claim as his decision. I said—‘This is your money, why should it be given only half of your money, I will give you the full amount’. He was pleased beyond expectation and my brother who was to give the money his joy had no bound. He said—‘Bhaiji (brother)! You have done a very good Judgement.’ This feeling that the decision was given by asking we to give something more is the sentiment of very high category. It does not take time in his Lord’s attainment. This event what I have told you has happened in my personal life.</p>
<p class="Text">If we surrender ourselves with our body, mind and the entire possession to the God-realized Mahatma (saint) and nothing is kept with us as ours, ‘the deliverance will be attained to us at the same time, because the binding is only of the sense of ‘I’ness’ and ‘mineness.’ When the sense of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ is gone, no bondage remains. The entire should be surrendered gladly. For the arbitrator there may be some hesitation when the money-giver has some attachment in money and he wants the judgement through him. Here the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ is money, if he has some lack in fully surrendering the sense of ‘I’ and mine than the great soul has same hesitation.</p>
<p class="Text">From whom to get the tax there arises no question from that who possess no goods of tax. There are several persons to go, what do the men of octroi post realize from them? They only ask—‘What is with you? They answer—‘Nothing’. It is only ‘I’ alone.’</p>
<p class="Text">Even the government cannot charge form them who have nothing in the whole world and here after in the next world even the lord Yama cannot take any tax.</p>
<p class="Text">By the vision of the great soul, he derives progressively every moment gain and the joy he is beyond himself in his joy. He remains gazing towards his attitude for any indication to him. Although, he becomes entitled of his salvation even without any indication, but if he gets any indication from his side then that indication is spiritual practice for him, if the Lord is attained by that spiritual exercise it is the matter of great importance. The lord is already prepared to meet without any spiritual exercise, as a matter of fact he gets some spiritual exercise practised by the man. If there is any indication to him that is very good for him. Let us remain ready every moment for the entire self dedication and wait for the command all the time If the inspiration is created then let us think that blessed we are today? I got such inspiration to do this work where is there in our luck to get inspiration? The person making practice of spiritual exercise remains moving around the great soul so that he may take real advantage if he gets any command even for the other one. As the Lord directed to Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तमेव शरणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्प्रसादात्परां शान्तिं स्थानं प्राप्यसि शाश्वतम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 18/62)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Take refuge in Him alone, with all your being, Arjuna. By His mere grace you shall attain Supreme peace and the Eternal state.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord gave this instruction to Arjuna, but we should take it for our own self, that is verily for us only, the Lord has used Arjuna as an instrument only to tell <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> for the whole word, that is for all in all we are included. The command may be for Arjuna but if we have faith and devotion we can take the same advantage what Arjuna took. If Arjuna failed to live it in his life, and we live in our life, Arjuna might not attain the Lord but we are sure to attain Him. The Lord has given this direction to Arjuna, so it is not possible for Arjuna to remain deprived of this benefit. The Lord has stated also—‘If you don’t follow My instructions you will fall down, With the ethical point of view this is correct. But Arjuna is the Lord’s devotee and a devotee never goes to down fall because, the Lord Himself admits it—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘भक्तोऽसि मे सखा चेति’</span> your are my devotee, My friend,’ and He has stated even this—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘न मे भक्त: प्रणश्यति’</span> ‘You are My devotee and my devotee never meets downfall’. So, there is no question of Arjuna’s downfall by any way at all, so using the word <span class="char-style-override-4">‘यदि’ </span>‘if’ the Lord states—‘If being overpowered by your egotism, you don’t follow my advice, then you will go to down fall.’ In not following the advice there in no other reason—it is only the egotism and that is very bad. Where there is egoism, there is sense of mineness where ‘I’ is ‘mine’ is there and the sense of mine is given up along with the egotism. The Lord utters—‘If you have only the feeling of egotism there can be downfall. There is no other reason of downfall. To use ‘If’ only means that Arjuna would not follow the Lord’s advice it is not so but ‘if’ he didn’t follow, simply means the ethics expressed by the Lord and fear shown by Him. In this fear, there is hidden this sense also lest Arjuna should follow the path of not acting upon His directions. It was not at all possible that Arjuna would follow the path of disobedience, he had unequaivocally said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्धा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाच्युत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">स्थितोऽस्मि गतसन्देहः करिष्ये वचनं तव॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 18/73)</p>
<p class="Text">Arjuna said: ‘Krishna, by your grace my delusion has gone and I have gained wisdom. I am free of all doubt, I will do your bidding.’ He began to act on his indication and he started dancing to His tune. Only this used to be the view of Arjuna that whatever the Lord said, only that was valuable whatever the Lord wants only this is valuable. He does only what the Lord wants. There is nothing separate as his own will except the Lord’s will.</p>
<p class="Text">To view the sight of the great soul, to listen to his speech, to converse with him, his contemplation or his contact with any organ-contact with mind, reason is only the source of progressive delight and joy. The joy what we get there in the company of the great man is immense, Joy is beyond limit. All the instances of the world are worthless before it. The Gopis had love in the Lord. So, for them the meeting with the Lord by any pretext was more valuable than any other object of the world. The same was the position of pious women. Krishna and Baladevji got the message conveyed to them that they were hungry. When they came to know it, they, themselves reached there with the meals where Krishna and Balaramaji were present and paid no heed to anyone. The husband of a woman locked her in the house as how she would go. That woman was the first to reach there Later on when her husband unlocked the house he saw that her dead body was lying in the house, she was breathless. Her soul had already reached the Lord. She was getting charmed to see the Lord again and again.</p>
<p class="Text">When the Lord Shri Krishnaji went back to His house passing through the woods the Gopi’s remained waiting at their gates to get His glimpse. Having got His view they used to be so much charmed that they lost the sense of their ownselves due to love, overjoy and happiness. In their view it was the attainment of the Lord only, it might not be so in other’s view. Thousands and lakhs of men saw the Lord but that was not the case with others what was there in the Gopis. They had the conviction of God’s attainment. This was their sentiment so, this feeling was never missing from their hearts. When sometimes their meeting with the Lord failed, one female friend said to another female friend—‘The Lord Shri Krishna is abiding in my heart, He does not appear before my sight or there should be created any such situation that I may forget Him, then may get mental rest or He should appear before my eyes.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">मैं आशिक तेरे नामका,</p>
<p class="Shlok">बिन मिले सब्र नहीं होता।</p>
<p class="Text">‘I am lover of your name without meeting you, I lose any patience.’</p>
<p class="Text">If we become such a lover of the Lord, then Lord will be bound to meet the devotees. In the <span class="char-style-override-5">Ramayana</span> written by Tulasidasji Vibhishanji says to Hanumanji—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अब मोहि भा भरोस हनुमंता। </p>
<p class="Shlok">बिनु हरिकृपा मिलहिं नहिं संता॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘I am now sure that without the Lord’s grace one cannot meet a great soul.’ This is the Lord’s boundless grace on me that I have got this great opportunity to meet you and the fruit of your visit is the meeting with the Lord. Now it has become certain that the Lord will be attained. If this sentiment is inculcated in our heart that the great souls are attained by the Lord’s grace only that grace falls on a man upto that level as he visualizes on him. It we make up our mind that grace is full than it is full. The symptom of the perfect grace is that the Lord is also attained along with the attainment of the great soul. The meeting with the Lord is also the fruit of his full grace or it may be said in other words that this is the embodiment of his whole-hearted grace. It is beyond our capacity to give up the flood of that joy. If we come to realize the feelings of the great souls or we come to understand his indication then if we remained deprived of the practice accordingly or we deny it, this is beyond our capacity. His indication will compel us to act accordingly; it will itself get the work done. There is such a joy that we cannot check ourselves, even the other cannot check us. It is not our capacity not to incline towards it or to check ourselves from doing accordingly. The Lord Shri Ramachandraji was devoted to his father, Dasharath, that devotion was due to His reverence of father and not because of his feeling of a great soul. The devotion to the great soul is of higher grade. The Lord Shri Ramachandra, did not even consider Dasharath as God or any great soul, He treated him only as his father. In the Valmiki Ramayana the Lord said to Kausalya very clearly that it was beyond his capacity to disobey his father’s command. If my father asked me to go the woods and I should disobey his command, it is not possible for me. Kaikeyi says—‘I asked for my granted boon from your father now he is hesitating to banish you’. In the <span class="char-style-override-5">Ramayana</span> written by Tulasidas, it has been stated that the Lord Rama said—‘Mother, what is hesitation there? Here lies my interest by all the ways. First this is the order of the father and here is your consent and in the woods the opportunity to enjoy the company of sages and seers and the most prime is that my dearest brother, Bharat will get the throne. This is the matter of great fortune to me I will not get such an opportunity in future again. If I miss this chance, I will be counted the chief among the fools. To obey My father’s order I can jump into the flaming fire, I can take poison, as regards going to the forest that is quite immaterial. To say to obey the command is a blot. The question to say ‘No’ does not even arise.’ Such was the devotion in the obedience of the father’s commond. On the realization of the great soul there is more devotion than this and on the thinking of the supreme Lord our devotion is of the category even higher than then this, Just when the devotion is created in our heart, the very time there should be the attainment of the Lord. It is the lack of devotion only the main cause. Just when we believe a Mahatma as a Mahatma in our mind. There should be the attainment of the Lord. Otherwise we lack In faith and devotion, we lack in sagacity. There are two kinds of devotion—with selfish motive and with the selfless motive. The devotion with selfish motive is not of higher category, the desire is also due to unwise mind. Due to this there is the possibility of delay; there is no delay in God-realization in the devotion with unselfish motive. The devotee of spiritual exercise comes to realize God in reality by the Lord’s grace. Love is the source of Lord’s appearance. Shivji Maharaj says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">हरि व्यापक सर्वत्र समाना। </p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रेम तें प्रगट होहिं मैं जाना॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Lord is omnipresent, but He is revealed only by love, I am well acquainted with this fact.’ </p>
<p class="Text">After knowing the great soul as a great soul by his indication he dances to his tune smilingly. If the example of the monkey or any Juggler is given that does not apply here, because the monkey dances, no doubt, but he doesn’t feel pleasure. If I give the example of a puppet that also does not apply, because the puppet also dances only on the direction of the stage master; but that is  an inanimate, there is no mind and reason in it, so the question of joy and pleasure doesn’t arise at all. There is no such example in the worldly objects through which this situation may be explained. He who has attained that state is the only example. The Lord remains hidden from such matchless loving devotees for their interest—to intensify their eagerness and longing when their devotion and love and restlessness reaches the climax, He cannot remain hidden from them. The Lord may be anywhere but the devotees search Him out. When Lord appears in the disguised form of female friend, the female friends distinguish Him that He is not a female friend but male-friend. Those who have realized the spiritual truth, who enjoy His company, who have the experience of his form, the Lord cannot remain hidden from them The Lord states.</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/30)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He who sees Me (the Universal Self) present in all beings, and all beings existing in Me, never lost to Me nor do I ever lose sight of him.’ Whatever he does his all the actions are dedicated to Me. The Lord has stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थितः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/31)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Yogi who is established in union with Me, and worships Me as dwelling in all beings as their very self, abides in Me, no matter what he does.’ </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">In his eyes there is nothing in the world but the Lord only He cannot be separated from the Lord even for a moment, and nor does the Lord ever lose sight of him because—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘तद्विस्मरणे परम व्याकुलता’</span>—In the absence of his rememberance of the Lord his restlessness reaches the climax state. But the restlessness should be in separation but is never separation there. The separation is possible only in the period of spiritual discipline but that separation is also more pleasant than the joy in a contact. In the state of separation the mind always remains anchored to the lover; he cannot be forgotten at all. If by chance, one forgets his lover any time his mind becomes quite perturbed, This is the matter related to the restlessness of separation. Where there is apparent union what is there to say. When there is the apparent sight of the Lord whether it is in any form of Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, that is all the same, his wonder has no limit whereas I and where the Lord. What am I seeing? The Lord is joining me. In such a situation the joy has no bound. But when he comes to realize in reality then the eulogy, the prayer, worship, fear, shame, honour have no meaning there. It the praise or prayer is visible anywhere it means there is some lack in knowing the Lord in reality prayer is made in the state of spiritual practice. When there in the perfect realization of the Lord. Who should extoll and whom to extoll then? Eulogy is the praise of virtues. Eulogy is a type of flattery. There who should flatter and to whom and for what? Prayer means to beg something from the Lord. When there is nothing remaining then what should be begged for? Where there is want there is demand. When we consideer ourselves as superior and inferior there is the honour, welcome and respect, where there is identity who should give honours and welcome and to whom? The fear is there where there is the possibility of some harm There is no trace of any harm at all; then why fear? Shame is there where there is a non-identity, the feeling of other. There is no question of shame with one’s ownself. All such feelings are away. The devotee and the Lord are two only outwardly but basically they are one.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">The way to attain the Lord in a moment—the glory of the association with great souls</p>
<p class="Text">This is related to the time, when the Lord Shri Ramachandraji Maharaj returned from woods and entered Ayodhya. The reverence of people to the Lord Rama is imitable. To see their reverence and devotion at that time the Lord’s words in praise is beyond description. The Lord is returning to Ayodhya by the aerial Pushpak and He is guiding the monkeys that Ayodhya is his motherland and this is providing the supreme abode to that who reside here, Man is liberated from the bond of this mortal world by taking bath in the ‘Sarayu’ river. In the praise of  Ayodhya the Lord is saying to the monkeys—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जद्यपि सब बैकुंठ बखाना। </p>
<p class="Shlok">बेद पुरान बिदित जगु जाना॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">अवधपुरी सम प्रिय नहिं सोऊ। </p>
<p class="Shlok">यह प्रसंग जानइ कोउ कोऊ॥</p>
<p class="Text"> ‘Although all Vedas and people have extolled Vaikuntha (My divine Abode) but that is not so dear to Me as much as Ayodhya is dear only some rare soul knows the secret.’ It is so because the residents of Ayodhya have supernatural love for me. Those residing in Audh are dearest to me.</p>
<p class="Text">The Secret is that love of the residents of Audh is greater than the love of those dwelling in Vaikuntha. There whose I get more love is dearer to me. The Lord is drawn by love only. The lord came and met Bharat, Shatrughna, sages and the Gurus and elders. At that time people came there running to get the sight of the Lord. To see that situation, The Lord thought they had reached here having detached themselves from all only to meet Me, only for My love. How to meet everyone with My single body? So the Lord Himself appeared in countless forms and met each and everyone—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अमित रूप प्रगटे तेहि काला। </p>
<p class="Shlok">जथाजोग मिले सबहिं कृपाला॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Seeing all the people impatient in their love to meet the Lord, He forthwith appeared in countless forms and in this way the gracious Lord met everybody in an appropriate manner.’ ‘As one deserves has two meanings—First, those who were younger to him, came and fell on the feet of the Lord and the Lord having lifted them embraced them to his heart and then who were elder to the Lord, the Lord touched their feet and those who were contemporary to him like friend etc., the Lord met embracing them to his heart. Then the Lord met every one as he deserved. The Lord met the elders with reverence, the contemporary with love and the younger with affection Thus, He met everybody properly. Its another meaning is—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जिन्ह कें रही भावना जैसी। </p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रभु मूरति तिन्ह देखी तैसी॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Lord met each and everyone and whom he met, found him according to his feelings as he wanted to see His form.’ The Lord emancipated all in a moment meeting them. The Lord Shankar says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अमित रूप प्रगटे तेहि काला। </p>
<p class="Shlok">जथाजोग मिले सबहिं कृपाला॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘In a moment the Lord greeted them all; Uma, this was a mystery which none could comprehend.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is meeting everybody; he whom He is meeting, is realizing that it is he only whom, He is meeting his joys have no bound. He becomes wonder-stuck to think that on one side the Lord, so great and on the otherside ‘I’ so common and so lower to Him and the Lord is meeting me! The Lord is meeting such a petty person like me without any cause! Because he is not deserving and if the Lord is attained without being worthy of it, certainly that will be the matter of surprise for him and his joy will go beyond of the limit that the lord met me first of all. The people think—‘What is that love, devotion and emotion in me that the Lord met, I am so a mean. Shankarji says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उमा दारु जोषित की नाईं। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सबहि नचावत रामु गोसाईं॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Uma, as the stage manager makes the puppet dance according to his wish, in the same way the Lord has made a puppet of the whole world to dance on his direction. All the beings of the whole world are puppets and it is the Lord who makes them dance.’</p>
<p class="Text">If we do understand the mystery of this single couplet, the very time, the Lord should be attained. Because, if the Lord makes everyone dance then, we are also included among all. We should become the puppet of the Lord. Let us handover our string to his hand to make us dance. How happy we are to dance on the indication of the Lord a stage manager to make us dance! Our body is changed our life is changed. We should accept that what Shivji said that is true. All are the puppets in the hand of the Lord and he is the stage manager to make us dance. If we live it in our life then our purpose of the Lord’s attainment is served that the Lord is present in all beings and we also are with all.’</p>
<p class="Text">Let us hand over the rein of our life to the Lord’s hand. As Arjuna had handed over his to the hands of Lord Shri Krishna similarly like the same we should also hand over the long rein of the horses of our organs and the chariot of our body to the hands of the Lord. Let us dedicate our entire to the Lord and then, this mundane existence is crossed over.</p>
<p class="Text">The next notable point is that the Lord is doing pastimes and is sporting. This world is the play ground of the Lord. Whatever is happening in the world let us understand it the sportive display of the Lord. Let us take it as the frolicsome activities of the Lord. If we are pleased to see this drama, even then we may be liberated from this mortal world. The people go to visit cinema, then their eyesight and time is wasted the money is wasted we learn evils. This and hereafter the next world, both are destroyed. That is a false show merely, but the Lord is playing the true show. If we remain cheerful to consider it a cinema, our object is accomplished. Whatever is happening that is the sportive display of the Lord. Accept it as the play of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">If the son died, think that is the play of the Lord and the son was born then also that is His sport. If you suffer the loss of one thousand rupees remain happy considering it the sportive display of the Lord and when you are in the profit of one thousand rupees consider it also his sportive display. If your body suffers from any disease that is also his show and if cured that is also the same sportive display. Whatever is being done in this world, to see it if you remain being charmed with it considering it simply the sportive display of the Lord, even then your life boat has crossed the ocean of  the mundane existence. Thus understanding the meaning of each and every couplet of the <span class="char-style-override-5">‘Ramayana’</span> and understanding the sense of each and every verse of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> if you bring it in the practice of your life then it is the sure way of your deliverance. Taking it so in our mind we havo to live it in our Life, we have to develop faith, just mark the emotional sentiment of the citizens of Ayodhya when the Lord is returning from the woods, they are very much enthusiastic in their hearts to think that they will get the glimpse of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">If such a zeal remains in our heart similarly then where is delay? There was zeal and enthusiasm in the heart of Sutikshna that Lord would be visioned to him. ‘Today, I will see the sight of the Lord’s lotus face apparently so he got the Lord’s view doubtlessly, because he had firm  faith in his mind likewise, let us also develop such a faith in our heart that the Lord will meet us today and let us wait to meet the Lord. There is a story—</p>
<p class="Text">There was a prostitute named Pingala, once, she was waiting for her customer but no man turned up. At 12 O’clock in the mid of night it came to her mind that ‘as I am waiting for my customer to earn money just like the same if I had waited for the Lord, he would have come certainly.’ Her mind changed. When her mind changed she left that evil profession for ever and became excessively eager for the Lord. She began to wait for the Lord and then the Lord came and by His vision He liberated her.</p>
<p class="Text">Whosoever he may be, The Lord has no consideration of anyone’s errors, neither he minds of his conduct nor of his caste and nor of his condition and age, what was the age of Dhruva and Prahlad, he met them also. If we are bent upon to attain the Lord even now the same rule prevails. There was a girl who was such a fool, so dull-witted in her childhood that when she got annoyed, she used to weep and dash her head to the wall. Her family members kept her under lock. Her family members made her studied the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>. Now, the members of her husband’s family are so happy to get her as if they have got a gem. Just think of this miracle. Now she can well explain the meaning of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>, the subject of the verse, from the subject the verse its meaning, from the verse the subject, from the meaning the verse, from the verse its meaning and sense, from the number the verse and its meaning—as she can explain, hardly there would be anyone among you who can explain so. Thus, this can be possible so even by a dull-witted girl after practice; then the Lord can be attained very soon by the practice, what is there any strange. The Lord, Himself admits it in <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्यचेताः सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यशः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं सुलभः पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिनः॥</p>

<p class="Text">‘Arjuna, whosever always and constantly thinks of Me with undivided Mind to that Yogi ever absorbed in Me, I am easily attainable.’</p>
<p class="Text">Here the word ‘Yogi’ means the devotee, for such a devotee I am easily attainable. The Lord has stated only one condition for us that is to think of the Lord always and constantly with undivided mind. For practising it there is no expenditure of even a penny. There is neither labour nor any investment of time. By having faith in the words of the Lord, the Lord is easily attainable to him. What is our investment in inculcating faith? ‘To accept’ means ‘faith’.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever has been stated in the<span class="char-style-override-5"> Gita</span> that is true word by word. It is enough for us only to accept it in our mind because who is more important than the Lord in whose contemplation we should pass our time? If we accept it by our mind we will be at least free from the worthless contemplation of the past whole life. This is verily sure gain. We must have the confidence in our mind that the Lord will be attained one day it is sure. This is the Lord’s resolve—‘I am easily attainable.’ Then why should we keep doubt in our mind? The words of a great soul also can never be untrue, that is also worth believing. If we don’t have faith in the words of the Lord then whose words are to be believed upon? The <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> is an epitome of all the scriptures. At least, we must have faith in the words of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>. Enough it is, it requires only faith and nothing other is needed. We lack in faith only. </p>
<p class="Text">If we develop our faith in only one verse of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> it means we have crossed the ocean of mundane existence and there are hundreds of such verses in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> like if we develop our faith only in a single couplet and a single chaupai of <span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanas</span>, what a fine it is!</p>
<p class="Text">I tell you about the ordains of scriptures. If anyone lives to it I am confident that his aim may be gained. I do pray and if anyone live it in his life, I express my obligation also, I am indebted to you. I go to the extent to say that simple minded fellow has approached us for the highest good. Until his highest good is done I am indebted to him. For the fulfillment of his objective if he should be made to listen the words of the Lord and he should live them in his life, he may get salvation or the Lord showers His special grace upon him then his purpose may be served. The Lord has no scarcity of anything.</p>
<p class="Text">All the citizens of Ayodhya approached, it is not so that all were the great souls of high category. All kinds of men live in a city. But the Lord provided salvation by His vision to all and sundry without any consideration of deserving and non-deserving or worthless at all, He met in a moment all and sundry without having any distinction in his mind, if the Lord wishes he may do the highest good of the whole world within a moment. This is not strange for Him. Let us have such a conviction in our mind that Lord’s power and capacity is beyond limit. Let us make up our mind to realize that whatever influence is in this world that is all the influence of the supreme Lord. There is none except him who has any influence.</p>
<p class="Text"> It can be explained to you by logic, by quoting the scriptures that whatever happens in the world, whatever knowledge is in the savants, whatever the lustre is in the lusterous men, whatever the wit in the wise men. That all belongs to the supreme God. Whatever the light is in the sun and moon, whatever the power is in wind, whatever the radience in the fire is that is all of the Lord. Whatever the glory, brilliance, energy, knowledge are, all these manifestatioons of the Lord. The Lord states very clearly.</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसंभवम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 10/41)</p>
<p class="Text">Every such being as is glorious, brilliant and powerful, know that to be a part manifestation of my glory.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states that all such things as are glorious, brilliant and powerful in the world that are only a part manifestation of His glory. In the whole world wherever either in India, America etc., any country of the world there is electricity, anywhere where we are getting the light or using the fan from the electricity, the electricity is being used in running the machines, in the speech, in air conditioning, making ice, freezing or taking the work of fire from the electricity, the radio is broadcasting the engine is working that is all only a part of the power of electricity because there is no end of electricity in the whole world.</p>
<p class="Text">Besides this if we make any invention we may make thousands of inventions, even then the electricity is limited, but the Lord’s influence is unlimited. The Lord is stating to us that as apparently there is the power of electricity only in  running all their instruments in the same way every such being as is glorious, brilliant and powerful in the world all as combined is merely a part manifestation of the Lord’s glory. It can he understood rationaly by the example of the electricity also. The<span class="char-style-override-5"> Gita</span> itself is the version of the Lord then why does it take so long time in the Lord’s attainment? It we develop such a firm fath in us that this is all the Lords influence then, there will be no delay. The scriptures state that the Lord can make possible what is even impossible. If even the Lord is not able to do then who can do?</p>
<p class="Text">By knowing the Lord’s influence also we can cross the ocean of this material world. The Lord’s mercy has no limit. The Lord’s mercy is much more than our imagination and beyond our understanding. We think that Lord’s mercy is usual and common. It should be our understanding that the Lord’s grace showers on the deserving one. But He becomes graceful to the undeserving also if the deserving  not be there. But His mercy extends to those also who are unworthy even. If this truth comes to your mind and if we are unworthy even then our deliverance is possible.</p>
<p class="Text">Putna is going to the Lord. She is neither deserving nor undeserving. She is the reverse. Disguised in the deceitful form she is going to give poison to the Lord. Her conduct is fraudulent her inward motive is deceitful. It such a motive is with any creature it is hateful and if it is with the Lord that is even more hateful than that, but the Lord emancipated her also while she was undeserving and entirely unworthy. There is nothing like deserving and undeserving before the Lord. It is we the human beings who suffer loss by our mental discrimination of deserving and undeserving and remain deprived of the gain. If we don’t apply our wit and depend ourrelves on the Lord’s will, we will cross the ocean of this mortal world.</p>
<p class="Text">We should make it our principle that in the shelter of the Lord any body whether deserving, not deserving or unworthy or well-deserving gets deliverance. As the fire burns every object in the same way the Lord’s worship and meditation and glory destroys all the sins. Really we don’t understand it. If this is our belief that the Lord’s worship and his glory destroys only the part of our sins, then according to our thinking only part of our sins will be destroyed because we have given the importance to His worship and glory only to this extent. So it is effective for us only to that extent. Thus Lord states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।</p>
<p class="Text">‘Arjuna however men seek me even so do I approach them, for all men follow my path every way.’ If we take the meaning of the word ‘Yatha’ as type or kind it is also right and if we mean it as sense or emotion that is also right. By taking its meaning as ‘kind’ the sense is that if any one thinks of the Lord the Lord also meditates on him in the same way. How ever man worships the Lord even so does He adores him. In the ‘<span class="char-style-override-5">Shantiparva</span> of <span class="char-style-override-5">Mahabharata</span>’ a fable occurs—</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Krishna was trying to persuade Yudhishthir. Vedavyas also tried and the other sages and seers tried to persuade him but the feeling of renunciation had overpowered Yudhishthir’s consciousness so much, his mind had detached so much that. Having left everything and having handed over the sovereignty to Bhimsen I will depart for the woods and reaching there I will pass my life in the spiritual exercise, muttering the Lord’s name, prayer and meditation and in the practice of penance. This was his firm determination he had made up his mind.</p>
<p class="Text">One day, the Lord had stayed in the palace of Arjuna. There the Lord was absorbed in His Morning meditation Yudhishthir came to meet the Lord. He saw that the Lord was absorbed in meditation, when the meditation was over Maharaj Yudhishthir asked—whom were you meditating? If it is not the matter of secret and worth telling and if you think me deserving then tell me who was that one whom you were meditating?’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord said—‘Yudhishthir! Bhishmapitamah is thinking of Me laying on the bed of arrows, so I am meditating upon him, Here, what the Lord pointedout is ‘However anyone seeks the Lord even so does He approach him. And again said that he would go to him. He is the sun of seriptures and wants to set in. If you have to ask anything ask it to Bhishma. There is no other one in the world like Bhishma who knows the truth and mystery of the scriptures. The Lord along with Yudhishthir and other Pandavas went to Bhishma. Reaching there the Lord began to say to Bhishma—‘These Pandavas have come to you, give them teachings.’ Bhishma said ‘Maharaj! I am helpless. My whole body has been wounded with the arrows. As the fountain falls through the mountain, just like the same my body is bleeding. I am feeling the severe pain in the whole body. I have no energy to speak, it is better if you give the sermons. They should also listen and I too.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord touched the body of Bhishma Just by the touch the pain of whole body and his restlessness were gone. His mind and reason became quite fresh. Then the Lord said—‘Now, you are physically fit and mentally fit with fresh reasoning power.’ Bhishmaji said—‘By your grace I am quite well even then this is my prayer to you that it is you to give the sermon, this is my longing to listen from you. But the Lord said—‘It is my wish that you should speak. I want to get uttered by you.’ Bhishmaji then said—‘Well! Maharaj, as is your will’ then Bhishmaji began to say.</p>
<p class="Text">Yudhishthirji considered the Lord as The friend of Arjuna and to Bhishma as a great soul of the supreme rank.—so, Lord paised him highly to develop his more reverence in him, first He dereloped his reverence and having developed his full  devotion in him, he ordered Bhishmaji—‘Give your teachings.’ The words listened from him for whom there is reverence leave a great impression. The Lord had already said earlier and Vedvyasji too had persuaded but all proved ineffective. So the Lord selected Bhishma to persuade. First, he praised Bhishmaji excessively which developed a great reverence and devotion in the heart of Yudhishthir and He gave strength, talent, lustre and knowledge and His blessing to Bhishmaji. Bhishmaji remaind lying on the arrow bed for fifty eight days. Eight days had passed away Bhishmaji made his speech for the rest fifty days remaining lying on the bed of arrows. Yudhishthir’s mind changed and agreed for his coronation. Whatever the work the Lord wanted to do, He used anyone as His instrument. The work should be done; the instrument may be anyone, what is our concern with it? The Lord, Himself has said us in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्तः श्रद्धयार्चितमिच्छति। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्य तस्याचलां श्रद्धां तामेव विदधाम्यहम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 7/21)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Whatever celestial form a devotee (craving for some worldly object) chooses to worship with reverence, I stabilize the faith of that particular devotee in that very form.’ This is the policy of the Lord that the devotees of celestial form attain to that celestial form, the votaries of the deceased attain to their manes, the worshippers of the ghosts and evil spirits attain to the ghosts and evil spirits and the devotees of mine attained to Me—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यान्ति देवव्रता देवान् पितॄन्यान्ति पितृव्रताः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">भूतानि यान्ति भूतेज्या यान्ति मद्याजिनोऽपि माम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 9/25)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Those who are votaries of gods go to gods, these who are votaries of manes reach the manes; those who adore the spirits, reach the spirts and those who worship Me, come to Me alone.’</p>
<p class="Text">And He adds later on this also—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम्। </p>
<p class="Shlok">देवान्देवयजो यान्ति मद्भक्ता यान्ति मामपि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 7/23)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The fruit gained by these people of small understanding, however, is perishable. The worshippers of gods attain the gods; whereas My devotees, however, they worship Me eventually come to Me and Me alone.’</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever celestial form a devotee chooses to worship with reverence, I stablize the faith of that particular devotee in that very form. According to his faith and devotion whatever worldly desires he hopes from that god he gets  his desire is fulfilled as verily ordained by My self, but that fool doesn’t understand, so instead of My worship he worships them.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord used his own same policy in practice. Mahatma Gandhiji had praised highly the glory of Rama’s Name. He used to say—‘Whatever support is to me that is only Rama’s Name. My all the works start with Rama’s Name. Rama’s Name is at the top of all. As a man cannot remain alive without taking breath, similarly I cannot remain alive without Rama’s Name.’ What a firm faith he had! We always say to the devotees of Gandhiji that—‘Just mark, what a great worshipper of Rama’s Name is Gandhiji! We should also imitate Gandhiji and worship like him. If having faith and devotion in Gandhiji they also worship the Rama’s Name, They are devoted to that work and become gainer then our purpose should not be that you should mutter Rama’s Name only according to our devotion. We are not to achieve any heroism. My principle is that one should mutter the Lord’s Name by anyway. The muslim fellows should redeem themselves by repeating the names of Allah, Khuda, Vishmilla so that reforming themselves they may liberate themselves. That is a matter of great pleasure for us; they should develop their faith in their own deity. ‘Quran Sarif’ is the holiest and the supreme religious book for them. Mahammad Sahib is their preceptor and the prophet. His sermon is to mutter Allah, Vishmilla. For them this is number one, this is the matter of great pleasure that any how there should be their highest good by chanting names of the Lord Allah, Vishmilla, God all these are names of God, There should be the muttering and chanting of the Lord’s Name. This is the Principle of the Lord that ‘whatever celestial form a devotee chooses (craving for some worldly objects) to worship with reverence I stabilize the faith of that particular devotee in that very form.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, we too, should stabilize their faith to that great soul which they choose to worship and bring them on the right path. Whatever that Mahatma (the realized soul) says and whatever the lacuna is there we should fulfill it, if they worship with selfish motive you should advise to them to worship without any self-interest with the selfless motive and then your ultimate goal is achieved. The selfless feeling is beneficent. Only be free from desires. If anyone, worships even the god’s, with unselfish motive, their lies his highest good. The selfless sentiment is always beneveolent to us. This is the greatness of the Lord that He Himself did not give the sermons, but He got them uttered through Bhishma and developed His reverence in Bhishma. The Lord had to serve His purpose only. His purpose was only that Yudhishthir should sit on the throne and get himself coronated, and this purpose was served. When Arjuna’s mind got detached from the war, the Lord’s purpose was to engage Arjuna in the war. The purpose of telling <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> was only this. For <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> and for the war Lord’s purpose was to use Arjuna as instrument. The Lord, Himself says—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘निमित्तमात्रं भव सव्यसाचिन्।</span> ‘These warriors stand already slain by me, be you only an instrument, Arjuna.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Arjuna turned away from the war only because of love and attachment for the family. The Lord again engaged him in fighting the war. By giving the sermons of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> He made the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> an instrument because He had to do good of the world through <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>. If today, there had not been the existence of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> how would have been the good of the world in this way?</p>
<p class="Text">It is the will of the Lord; He may use anyone as an instrument. If you say that the Lord is just, so He liberates only those who deserve deliverance. This is true, but this is to be implied elsewhere and not in the matter of deliverance. To be just is a very good quality but compassion has its special importance. Compassion’s flood has its overflow. Where there is the flood of love, the propriety doesn’t stand there. Where there is the flood of Lord’s compassion, to think of morality and justice, there is foolishness. The ethics has no meaning there. Here, the rule and policy should not be implied. Where there is the flood of love there remains nothing like ethics and policy. The propriety is meaningless there—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न लाज तीन लोक की न वेद को कह्यो करै, </p>
<p class="Shlok">न शंक भूत प्रेत की न देव यक्ष ते डरै।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुने न कान और की द्रसे न और इच्छना,</p>
<p class="Shlok">कहे न मुख और बात यह भक्ति-प्रेम-लच्छना॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘When the man is charmed with love-devotion, and becomes fascinated, by it, he crosses the boundary of public slander and the shame and propriety of the three worlds whatever people say but he rises above the ordains of Vedas, scriptures. To obey them is out of his control. He is not afraid of spirits, gods, devils and demons and nor does he remain suspicious of them. He raves only about the Lord’s love and doesn’t pay heed to others. He listens attentively topics related to God and to other affairs he does not care. His attention is not diverted towards the world what people say. Neither he cherishes any desire in his mind, nor he utters any other thing from his mouth, and nor he listens to any other word from others by his ears. These are the symptoms of love and devotion. There is no room for the lover to decorum in the matter of love. Where there is propriety in love? When the Lord opens the treasure of compassion, whosoever may come dashing he is fulfulled? Heaven and beatitude are nothing in comparison to ‘Satsanga’ (company of great souls). If the Lord wills what is impossible for Him to do? As making Arjuna the instrument, He produced such a religious volume like <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>, similarly to whomsoever he may think so, making him His instrument He may display another greater book then even <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>. If the Lord so wish, making the magazine <span class="char-style-override-5">Kalyana</span> as instrument He may bring redemption of the whole world. If there is the will of the Lord they may make Gita Press or create another press for the highest wellbeing of all the beings. There are a number of presses in the world, there are a number of men, a number of magazines, making anyone of them as His instrument He may do the highest good to all. Whatever the Lord wants He may do it making anyone as His instruement. It is not proper to say that why does Lord do the highest good to all without any reason? You cannot ask the reason, why did the Lord sermonized; <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> making Arjuna only as His instrument? The Lord made Arjuna His instrument and if He wants He can make anyone as instrument in place of Arjuna. The Lord had to produce this Gita for the wellbeing of the human beings. If the Lord has to do anything for the sake of the world the Lord can make anyone as instrument. In making any one an instrument, the main purpose is the supreme wellbeing of the beings of the world. From time to time the Lord usually makes such arrangements. Sometimes He, Himself, incarnates sometimes He sends any man as His messenger giving him His authority from His supreme abode and sometimes authorizes any human being of this world on His own behalf. He may give His right to anyone when He prefers. If he wants He may give even the higher position then Brahma even to a mosquito and make Brahmaji even lower then a mosquito. Nothing is strange and impossible for the Lord. Why doesn’t he do? It is His pleasure, why does He do so? It is also His pleasure. Who are we to argue about it? We have no right to argue? A moment of Satsanga, (communion with saints) which enables the highest good to the thousands of beings, that is superior to beatitude. If on one side there is only one’s own deliverance and on other side his company provides deliverance to the millions of men, in that situation it is proper without thinking of self-deliverance one should give opportunity of deliverance to the millions of men. Along with it our deliverance is already there. The communion with great souls or God is even more beneficial than emancipation. Such commmunion whether it is of the God, of great souls. The Lord is the great soul of the great souls. The glory of the communion of the great souls what has been praised includes the lord as well. The Lord, Himself is the member of the company of great souls. His holy company is superior to the company of even the Yogi (who has realized the truth) and the devotees. Lord utters about devotees superior to Himself. For fun sake or out of compassion He may say.</p>
<p class="Shlok">मोरें मन प्रभु अस बिस्वासा। </p>

<p class="Text para-style-override-5">‘It is the firm conviction of my mind—that Rama’s devotees are greater than Shri Rama, Himself. Lord Rama is the ocean and the wise saints are like the rain clouds and while Shri Hari is the sandal tree and the saints represent the winds that spread its perfume.’<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">At once gain after heart-melting</p>
<p class="Text">Whenever anyone’s heart melts towards anybody at that time he attains the same condition as that of melted shellac or lac. In the melted shellac whatever colour is dropped down it becomes of the same colour. If that shellac is not melted it remains almost unaffected by anything whatever is dropped on it. Similarly when one’s heart is melted, it bears the colour very impressive.</p>
<p class="Text">We have to colour to ourselves in the colour of Hari. By the Lord’s grace if anybody’s heart becomes restless, there may be a great change in his life. Now the question arises how will the heart melt in this way?</p>
<p class="Text">Its solution is to remember with the pathetic emotion or love the character of those men whose hearts have melted in the restlessness of the lord’s separation. By doing so our heart melts completely and by seeing their character with pathetic emotion, the heart melts even in the restlessness of separation. As for example, there are the characters of Shri Ramachandraji and Bharatji specially, when the scene of their meeting of each other comes before our eye-sight, automatically tears start falling our eyes. When there comes the reference of Shrawan Kumar, devoted to his parent, our heart melts completely. On the occasion of the Lord Shri Ramachandraji’s departure for the woods, the pathetic emotion being intense, melts our heart. The reference of Rukmaniji’s wailing in the separation of Lord and the reference of Gopi’s weeping in the separation of Lord’s melt our heart. When there occurs the reference of the meeting of Sudama and Lord Shri Krishna, the reference of their love and the occasion of Sutikshana and Lord Rama’s meeting melt our heart—whenever these occurrences come before our mind, our heart melts. There are so many such occurrences of devotion and pity in the scriptures like <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita, Ramayan, Bhagawat </span>etc., the religious volumes, we should remember them. The frolicsome activities of Rama and Bharataji should he remembered by us. The first meeting of Bharataji full of pathetic emotion with the Lord Rama in the wood and his second meeting with the Lord Rama when He returned to Ayodhya from the forest—there both meetings are of very high elation. At that time it appears as if Bharatji’s heart was excessively melted—restless with pathetic emotions. If by recollecting that scene if a man becomes emotional likewise, it leaves a very good impact on our mind. When Hanumanji reached Bharatji, describing that occasion Tulasidasji says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">राम बिरह सागर महँ भरत मगन मन होत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">बिप्र रूप धरि पवनसुत आइ गयउ जनु पोत॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 7/1-A)</p>
<p class="Text">‘While Bharat mind was thus sinking in the ocean of separation from Shri Rama, the son of the wind-god, disguised as Brahman, came like a bark to his rescue’ Thus, in this way Hanumanji Maharaj became the form of bark there to rescue the life of Bharataji The intensity of Bharataji’s restlessness of that time is as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बैठे देखि कुसासन जटा मुकुट कृस गात। </p>
<p class="Shlok">राम राम रघुपति जपत स्रवत नयन जलजात॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 7/1-B)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He found Bharat seated on a mat of Kush grass, emaciated in body with a coil of matted hair for a crown and the words, ‘Rama, Rama, Raghupati’ on his lips, his lotus eyes streaming forth tears.’ To see such a condition Hanumanji was overcharmed and every hair on his body stood erect. Hanumanji said—‘He whose name you are repeating on your lips, whose name you are constantly muttering, that Raghunathji along with Sitaji and Lakshmanaji has reached here. Just hearing this much Bharatji came to such a position as if his life were secured. Then, Bharatji asks Hanumanji—‘Brother who are you?’ This is a very good sentiment such emotional sentiments need to be read, heard and learnt from the books and when the occurrences are related, it may create the emotional feelings in the heart and the heart may melt and when the heart being melted, it begins to flow the stream of tears from the eyes. The character of Bharatji is matchless so from time to time the character of Bharatji should be read and listened.’ When our mind is overpowered with emotion and sentiments imbued in our heart are stabilized forever. So, having stabilized the love and devotion for the lord in our heart, body and every root of hair, we should weep for the lord with the pathetic emotion from time to time, we should feel restless so that our life may change. There should be eagerness for this. But it is usually found that we lack in such eagerness. If such a keenness grows in Narayana that is called keenness in real sense—</p>
<p class="Shlok">लगन लगन सब कोइ कहे लगन कहावे सोय। </p>
<p class="Shlok">नारायण वा लगन में तन मन दीजे खोय॥</p>
<p class="Text">There should be the true eagerness. When we forget ourselves, when there remains no sense of our body and mind in the devotion of Narayan, that is called the true devotion. We should make prayer in praise of the Lord and remain weeping pathetically before the Lord sinking in the ocean of Lord love’ O Lord! O Hari! O Govind! O Vasudeva! it is you only for my support I without you, have no other support. Lord! I have neither knowledge, nor devotion nor renunciation and nor love even. I have nothing of them. I am seeking shelter in you and that is also only in words. Lord! I wail seeking shelter in you wholeheartedly but this mind is fickle. It does not come in control. So, showing pity to me, lead to take me in Your shelter, You Yourself. Thus, with such a feeling of pity weep before the Lord, make prayer then this is the supreme sentiment.’ </p>
<p class="Text">In the devotional song if the chanting of the Lord’s name is practical, in the similar systematic musical tone it seems so pleasant that the desire is created in the mind that the congregational singing should remain continuing forever. In such a congregational singing we get the pure and supernatural taste, which is very helpful in the attainment of the Lord. It multiplies our love in the Lord, purifies our inner sense, there is gain and gain only. So we should remain organizing congregational singing in this way from time to time. While busy in congregational singing there should be such a feeling in the mind that Lord is here in the manifested form. The Lord heard the call of the devotee and reached there. We should think in the mind that the God has really come there and remaining in the sky He was showering the virtues on all. The Lord is the treasure of virtues, His each and every virtue is boundless and beyond limit. Forgiveness, kindness, peace, knowledge, detachment equanimity, contentment and love etc., all the virtuous qualities are very important. Lord is the ocean of mercy, the mass of love, If the ocean is poured down on anyone all-around him only the water will be visible to him. Just like the same as if the Lord has poured down the ocean of his grace on us and we are absorbed completely in his grace. Our mind, our reason, our organs of this body—each and every root of the hair of our body is fully overwhelmed with his grace. To get the image of that grace our joy has no bound. At that time it comes to our mind only that we had never imagined that the God is so kind-hearted. Let us be free from all worries to realize that kind-heartedness of the Lord and become obsessed in ecstasy and then we should be attentive towards love. Love is greater than even mercy. Just think—mark how much love is the Lord bestowing on us really, we are not worthy of it at all, even then the Lord is raining boundless mercy on me who is unworthy, undeserving and worthless </p>
<p class="Text">It is not so that the lord’s grace and love is reserved only for those who are worthy, He showers his mercy on the undeserving and unworthy men also, because, if he can shower His grace to such a man like me then, it is a matter of farfetched affair to doubt about his grace on them who are worthy. Let us think of in this light that neither I have knowledge nor love and nor devotion, there is nothing in me. In spite of being in such lower position I am considered worthy of His grace, this is a great strange. Having thought of our demerits, our errors, our sins, our vices, we should weep before the Lord open heartedly just like a young child who weeps bitterly on the delay of his mother’s arrival and when the mother reaches he tries to take long breath to get out of breath, the mother lifts up him in her lap and clings him to her bosom. Similarly, the lord lifts him up to reach there and clings to his heart. As the Lord Rama had lifted up Bharatji and had embraced him to His chest. Likewise lord Rama clings his devotee to his heart. The vow of the Lord and His nature is supernatural. If it may come to our mind and understanding our joy will be beyond the limit of our heart. The Lord’s nature, influence and His emotion all are supernatural. By turning our mind towards them, our joy pleasure, delight and peace are beyond limit. The idea comes to mind. ‘Oh’ whereas I so mean and negligible! And whereas as lord, the supreme! How can be relation between him and me? But the Lord is very kind-hearted and lover, so He maintains the contact. We had already forgotten the lord but he did not miss us. By remembering the lord and to see His form, virtues we should remain being charmed. If anyone is intoxicated to recollect His name the lord can do his highest good very soon by appearing before him. There can be the highest welfare of living beings by the recollection of Lord’s name and his form and if there is reverence, love and devotion also with it then it is excellent. The lord is ever omnipresent. Because of being very minute He is not visible to us but those who have subtle and purified intellect, He is visible to them. Keeping all these points in mind we should also shape ourselves accordingly Lord’s drama is very strange. That is completely full of love and joy. We should see the ethics and righteousness in every role of Lord’s character and besides it we should see His noble merits and His glory also. We should realize the Truth and the mystery also, we should feel charmed to see His unlimited influence and glory, to remember this frolicsome activities which are full of unlimited attributes. At the time when the lord, Shri Ramachandraji was killing Bali. He manifested His form and appeared before him. What is the condition of Bali at that time, when he saw towards Rama then—</p>
<p class="Shlok">हृदयँ प्रीति मुख बचन कठोरा। </p>

<p class="Text">‘Although his heart was full of love, the words on his lips were harsh; looking towards Shri Rama he said—‘Even though my lord, you descended on earth for upholding righteousness, You have killed me hiding as a hunter would kill a wild beast. I your enemy and Sugriva, your dear friend! For what fault did you take my life, my lord? Bali adores Rama as equal-minded but here; he blames him and asks Him—‘O Lord! am I your enemy and Sugriva is your friend? I want to know’ For what fault did you take my life, my Lord’ Vali’s words are harsh towards  Lord Rama, then the Lord answers according to his question—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनुज बधू भगिनी सुत नारी। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सुनु सठ कन्या सम ए चारी॥ </p>

<p class="Text">The harsh words what Bali had said to the Lord that He should be impartial, but you are not impartial—He incarnates for upholding the righteousness’ but he had challenged the Lord for His partial action. With his aforesaid words. Hearing the roar of Sugriva when Bali advanced, his wife Tara said to him clasping his feet with her hands—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुनु पति जिन्हहि मिलेउ सुग्रीवा। </p>
<p class="Shlok">ते द्वौ बंधु तेज बल सींवा॥ </p>

<p class="Text">‘Listen, my lord: the two brothers with whom Sugriva has concluded an alliance are of immense majesty and might. They are no other then Shri Rama and Lakshmana are the sons of king Dasharatha (the lord of <span class="char-style-override-9">k</span>osala) who can conquer Death himself on the field of battle.’</p>
<p class="Text">Bali too came to understand and said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कह बाली सुनु भीरु प्रिय समदरसी रघुनाथ। </p>
<p class="Shlok">जौं कदाचि मोहि मारहिं तौ पुनि होउँ सनाथ॥</p>

<p class="Text">‘Said Vali, Listen my timid darling ‘Shri Raghunath looks upon all with equanimity. Even if He kills me, I will attain His divine abode and have Him as my eternal Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">So, I am in gain from all sides having uttered Vali rushed up and closed with Sugriva. For him there is no discrimination between him and me while the Lord remained listening  at last Vali says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुनहु राम स्वामी सन चल न चातुरी मोरि। </p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रभु अजहूँ मैं पापी अंतकाल गति तोरि॥</p>

<p class="Text">‘Listen, Rama! My shrewdness cannot avail against my master upholding righteousness. But my Lord am a sinner yet even though I have found shelter in you at the hour of my death?’ </p>
<p class="Text">At the hour of my death when you are present still am I a sinner?  Hearing these words Lord Rama’s heart melted rather it watered thoroughly.  The result was that hearing those tender words of Bali, He touched his head with His hand.</p>
<p class="Text">Likewise our heart should melt on just hearing his tender words, Lord stroked His hand on His head.  Previously his speech was harsh, now it became quite tender.  His feelings  of his heart were good and now they became more purified.  Hearing Lord’s word, sentiments of his heart were enlightened. Bali also became thoroughly watered and Lord also got likewise watered.  What is that tender speech?  Vali says—</p>
<p class="Text">In this couplet the pathetic sentiment and emotion of love is overflowing. Here, the emotion of Bali’s heart turned into the sentiment of speech. First the harsh words he said—‘Are you descended on earth for uplifting the righteousness, but is it righteousness that you have killed me as a hunter would kill a wild beast, is it the justice? Sugriva  is your dear friend and am I your enemy?’—this was the harsh speech. Then, he asked—‘For what fault did you take my life my lord?’ although, Vali has not made such harsh speech in ‘<span class="char-style-override-5">Ramacharitamanasa</span>’, but in the ‘<span class="char-style-override-5">Valmiki Ramayana</span>’ he has made the arrogant speech  and more harsh speech than this. If we go through the dialogue there in ‘<span class="char-style-override-5">Valmiki Ramayana</span>’ there Bali says—‘O Rama! Those belonging to the monkey race are not at all violent. It would have been proper for you to kill me if I had been violent to the other living beings and the second point is that you killed me hiding yourself.’ If you were bent upon to kill me, then roaring you should have come face to face giving me a challenge you should have killed me. If you had been on front before me I would have sent. You to the world of Yama. One thing more I ask you that when the people will ask you in the open assembly, ‘How did you kill me?’ At that time what will be your answer? You killed me doing the favour of Sugriva, because Ravana has abducted your Sita and you want to get her released with the support of Sugriva. It you had told me earlier that Ravana had abducted your wife and asked me to bring her, I would have, presented her even along with Ravana before you.’ On such an arrogant speech the Lord Shri Rama said—‘O Vali! The gods are moving about in this mortal world, you don’t know this truth, that is why you are blaming an innocent one like me. To hear these mysterious secret words Vali came to understand and admitted his fault these are the references of <span class="char-style-override-5">Valmiki Ramayana</span>. The reference of <span class="char-style-override-5">Ramayana</span> written by Tulasidasji is as follows—To hear the words of Vali, Rama stroked Vali’s head with his tender hands the Lord Rama said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुनत राम अति कोमल बानी। </p>
<p class="Shlok">बालि सीस परसेउ निज पानी॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">अचल करौं तनु राखहु प्राना। </p>

<p class="Text">‘When Shri Rama heard the most tender words of Vali, He stroked his head with his hand—I make your body immortal; you may keep up your life said Vali—‘Listen’ O ocean of mercy sages: continue their efforts (For Realization) during successive births; but at the last moment they fail to utter the name ‘Rama’. It means that even after the continuous efforts during these successive births the sages fail to vision you then, how can I get your view? If in place of<span class="char-style-override-4"> ‘कहि’</span> (Kahi) <span class="char-style-override-4">‘कहीं’</span> (Kahin) is replaced its meaning will be changed as the lord does not come anywhere at the time of death. But this does not seem to a suitable meaning the lord does come—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘अंत रामकहि’</span>—At the time of death one who departs from the body remembering the lord’s name ‘Rama-Rama’ never returns to this mortal world. Such is the glory of Your Name. Not only this he adds more—</p>

<p class="Text">‘But he, on the strength of whose name Lord Shankar bestows immorality on all alike, has appeared in a visible form before my very eyes! Shall I ever get such a golden opportunity again? ‘Lord! even then you are telling me to make me immortal. Lord! who will be such a fool to plant the thorny acacia tree cutting down the ‘Kalpabriksha’ celestial tree (a tree which fulfils all desires) in its place. In his house? Lord, now I have the only prayer to you—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जेहिं जोनि जन्मौं कर्म बस तहँ राम पद अनुरागऊँ॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘In whatever species of life it may be my fate to be born, I may continue to love ‘Shri Rama’ (your) feet, this is the boon that I ask.’ ‘This son of mine Angada by name, is my equal in training and strength. Therefore, accept him, my master; and holding him by the arm, O lord of gods and men, treat him as your servant.’ Thus saying in this way he abandoned his body, He didn’t feel the least pain. As the elephant king does not remain aware of falling own the garland of his neck, similarly he gave up his life and the lord sent him to his supreme Abode. This was the prayer of Bali that in whatever species of life it might be his fate to be born. He might continue to love ‘Shri Rama’s feet. It is much higher from his side to say so and from the Lord side it was proper to do so. Thus, in the fable of the Lord the ethics and righteousness whatever is found there, need to be observed by us. The ethics is that when he asked, ‘What fault was mine that you killed me as a hunter would kill a beast. The Lord gave him answer that he was a great sinner so he killed him. This is the matter of righteousness and ethics both.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">When he said that he had killed him hiding from behind as a hunter would kill a beast and thus saying so he blames the Lord. The Lord gave its answer in this way—‘O wretch! Mean! You knew that your brother had taken refuge under the might of my arms; and yet in your vile arrogance you sought to kill Sugriva.’ Here, there is the matter of righteousness and ethics. This is not limited to the righteousness and ethics only that is full of merits also. If every  is observed carefully we find full love there. It means that here there is full love and compassion. Lord’s treatment is always compassionate and affectionate to anyone whosoever he may be. his behavior is without any attachment and of superior category. That includes all the noble merits and his glory. As regards virtues He stroked Bali’s head with his hand, and told him that He might make him immortal here. There is his glory and influence also. No man can grant life to anyone, if is only the lord who can do so. This is his influence. Although he had demanded the boon that in whatever species of life it might be his fate to be born he might continue to love Shri Rama’s feet. Even then the Lord sent Vali to his supreme Abode. This is what is his power and influence. It is beyond our capacity to send anyone to his supreme abode. The Lord can send anybody wherever he wants,. The lord can make impossible possible. He is omnipotent. The Lord blessed him with more gain then his demand. That also reveals his glory.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">Introduction of Lord’s Mercy</p>
<p class="Text">All of us—each and every human being of this world should bring progressive uplift in his conduct and behavior. The improvement of the behavior depends on the feelings of the heart. By the improvement of the sentiments and inner feelings there comes the natural change of the highest category in the outer behavior. There comes the improvement in the inner feelings and sentiment by the lord’s grace. The Lord already showers his grace on all and sundry. Then what is the reason that the gain attained by the Lord’s grace doesn’t look before us? Its main reason is that we don’t acknowledge the Lord’s grace on us. The reason of not accepting the Lord’s grace is the impurity of our heart and ignorance. These world go by seeking shelter to the Lord. ‘Whatever is happening that is all in the knowledge of the Lord, to admit it and have faith in it seeking-shelter to the Lord. What is happening without anybody’s desire is done by the Lord himself and what is being done by the other’s will is being got done by the Lord Himself through other. What is being done or got done by others is for our purification? Whatever is enjoyed allotted by our destiny, that much is purified at least. How to understand this subject? It is the most appropriate that we should think it the sportive display of the Lord or we should accept it as the reward offered by the Lord. In reality it is the Lord’s dispensation of our actions, but if we want to get much more benefit, we can be benefitted more by our significant attitude. To think the Lord’s grace in every action is the lofty attitude. By such understanding in mind the fruit of the Lord’s grace appears before us quite apparently whatever we undergo the destined to us without anybody’s desire or according to other’s will is the dispensation of the Lord and is full of compassion. So, we can take it as the reward of the Lord bestowed upon us. By accepting it the Lord’s reward there is the progressive increase of delight and peace in our inner sense. This delight and peace is Sattvic. Thus, let us remain obsessed in ecstasy and delighted in our inner sense every moment. Whatever is happening that is merely the playful activities of The Lord. All the objects are the Lord’s form. All the movements made by them is the sportive display of the Lord. In the path of devotion this is the highest sentiment. By chance as fated one happens to suffer from any disease, really, that is the result of his sinful deed and that is according to the divine law. The award given by the Lord doing always justice is auspicious to us by causing us to suffer the fruit of our sin the Lord wants to purify us; here also we should see the Lord’s grace. How to see here the Lord’s grace? At the time when we suffer from any disease this thought comes to our mind that this is the result of our past sins. A little sin results in great painful suffering. O otherwise, how would to the wandering in the eighty four lakhs of births be completed? The actions performed in the human birth give us their result of the actions of other species any birth give us even no result; because all other classes of birth are for undergoing destiny. So such a feeling should be created in our heart that we will never commit any sin. Such a sentiment is created in our inner organ only by the Lord’s grace. So, while suffering the result of sin the Lord’s grace should be there in our mind. Besides from this the Lord’s special grace is that we remember the Lord in sorrow. What a great mercy of the Lord is this! When we remember the Lord our sins are destroyed. Is there any means or practice to remember the Lord? To remember the Lord itself is the practice or way. Besides this in suffering from sorrow our spirit of endurance develops, the feeling of dispassion is created in our inner organ and many other gains like such appear in our mind. Thus, by seeing the Lord’s grace in sorrow we are the direct gainers.</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, by accepting all the happenings of the world as the display of the Lord when we feel delighted, there can remain no trace of anger, sorrow and fear at all. Anger is the creation of ignorance, we feel anger due to the action done by others against our mind. Let us accept it as the dispensation of the Lord. The Lord is acting the play, He is warning us to which extent we have progressed spiritually. He is making us acquainted with our condition, than there is no question of anger. This is the kind of a part of seeking-shelter to the Lord. The second important point is that if we use our knowledge, wealth, the vitality of our body, wit or any prowess whatever is within the right direction we will be worthy of confidence and the lord will grant us specially these properties. The Lord has blessed us with all these properties to attain Him and not to misuse them. Our misuse may probably cause us the result that we may be deprived of the right and power in future what God has given us. We take the sanction of pistol license from the Government, and if we start misusing the pistol then, will the Government again Issue us the licence? No, the Government will not issue but seize our license. Similarly, the right what this human body avails for the attainment, the Lord has given us this right for the redemption, because it is only the human body by which the salvation can be possible and not with any other body. If even getting this human being class of birth we don’t use it properly then on which basis, what will be the ground for his enthusiasm to grant us human body again? We are misusing our reason, talent prowess—the energy of work and self-confidence which are helpful in the Lords attainment. To engage our physical organs and sense organs in the worldly enjoyments we are misusing them. What is misuse? We spend money to purchase the objects of sensuous enjoyments, this is how we are misusing it, and we invest our mind, wit and energy in prurience, this is also the misuse. We are doing the deeds of more downfall then even this—we are assailing harm to others in anger, even by using money we are hurting others; we are using our body anyone also is doing harm to others; we are assailing harm to others by our intelligence, physical power also. By the senses also we are hurting others To do so is great sinful act. This is the misuse of God-gifted power. If we invest our same energy in the welfare of others in the Lord’s devotion the Lord can do our highest good even in this very body of human birth. So we should obey the Lord’s command particularly on priority basis.</p>
<p class="Text">The activities happening according to other’s will or God’s will are not under our control. Here in this respect we are completely helpless. All the works to be done willingly should be done carefully with unselfish motive according to the Lord’s command. When the Lord is playing his frolicsome activities and we are observing, His all the activities as His sportive display. We should also make our all efforts as the Lord’s stage-activity means it should be taken as the Lord’s sportive display. When our efforts begin to be performed according to the Lord’s will that is the form of divine play. In the incarnation period of Krishna the Lord acted His sportive display with the cowherd boys. All the cowherd boys did everything on the direction of the Lord Krishna according to his will. When the lord taking the Gopis with him making the play of dance cum song in His dramatic episode, the gopies danced and sang with the Lord according to his attitude. They were included in these frolicsome activities. Similarly, if all our natural activities and natural efforts begin to be done according to the Lord’s sportive display, we act upon the Lord’s will and command, our efforts, too, then our performances also can be considered as the Lord’s sportive display.</p>
<p class="Text">It should be in our mind that this world is the stage of the Lord’s frolic some activities, all of us are the actors of this world stage. It means we are the actors joining His dramatic episode. The Lord related <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> to Arjuna. The <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> is the apparent form of the Lord, the rhetoric literary speech of the lord is the verbal image of God that is the expression of the lord’s inner feelings, so, that is the Lord’s heart. As the Vedas are considered the breath of the Brahma, similarly is the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> the breaths of the apparent Dignified supreme Lord Shri Krishna So the preaching and publicity of <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> pleases the Lord much so much pleasure He gets from no other object. The Lord states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">य इमं परमं गुह्यं मद्भक्तेष्वभिधास्यति। </p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्तिं मयि परां कृत्वा मामेवैष्यत्यसंशयः॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">न च तस्मान्मनुष्येषु कश्चिन्मे प्रियकृत्तमः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">भविता न च मे तस्मादन्यः प्रियतरो भुवि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita </span>18/68-69)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He who, offering the highest love to me, preaches the most profound gospel of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita </span>among My devotees, shall come to Me alone; there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Among men there is none who does Me a more loving service than he; nor shall anyone be dearer to Me in the entire world than he.’ </p>
<p class="Text">This work (the preaching) is especially being done by ‘Gita Press’. All of us even being included in this pious job those who are not taking benefit from it should take special benefit. That especial benefit is that our co-workers should be given credit. Those holding high posts should consider themselves as a servant despite holding high post. A servant is the servant of all for the work of the Lord. As the great souls see all beings as the God Himself. Only they have been accepted as the exclusive devotees of the Lord. Lord Shri Rama states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सो अनन्य जाकें असि मति न टरइ हनुमंत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">मैं सेवक सचराचर रूप स्वामि भगवंत॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 4/3)</p>
<p class="Text">And he alone, Hanuman, is exclusively devoted to me who is steadfast in his conviction that he is the servant and that the Lord manifested in the form of the whole world animate and inanimate creation is the manifestation of the Lord his master. Being comprehended with such a feeling in heart we should serve all the beings with selfless motive. If there is any error, make our self responsible for this and say that this is our fault because we are already one among them and if is something good, then say that this work was done with his support as the supreme Lord Rama says before Vasishthaji—that the victory I got in the battle is due to these monkeys. The credit goes to them. The monkeys became the bark of the ocean of the battle. The Lord was also included there. Its meaning comes out that it was the victory of the Lord; but he gives credit of the victory to them. It is not a lie also. They were all included already, but it does not suit at all to say that my victory was the result of my power and influence. They were only the instrument. The great souls never say that they are exalted souls, and whatever is the gain to others is the result of his influence. If any saint boasts so he will never be regarded as a perfect saint. He will be considered Maha-Tama (‘Great-Dark’) means great ignorant. So we should imitate only those who were the great souls. In their utterances there should not be even the scent of honour and praise for them. Honour, Praise, repute or desire of position all these are selfish motive. There should not be the least selfish desire in the heart. Our sentiment is unselfish but we do nothing. That is also of no gain. In reality without the performance of action there can never be the consummation of actionlessness. So we should do the work with great zeal but along with it we should do the work remembering the Lord and considering it the Lord’s command. Our all  efforts should be made as the spiritual practice. We should act according to the Lord’s will, that is the spiritual practice of higher category. If our action is according to his indication, according to his command, that is the spiritual practice of higher category. Whatever the Lord has stated in the scriptures or conveyed through the seers, that is the Lord’s command and remains making us conscious also through our inner sense from time to time, that is the noble deed. This is the Lord’s inspiration. Sometimes by coursing inspiration to his devotees. He gets it unuttered from his devotee’s mouth. With this thinking in our mind our conduct and behavior should be according to his command or inspiration.</p>
<p class="Text">Whatever the sentiment has been related in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>, imbibing that sentiment if we start making our efforts accordingly that is to act upon the Lord’s will. We should think in our mind that this is the Lord’s will. By thinking so, the Lord can express his will joining his will with our will. But who are they whom He tells? The Lord tells this to those devotees who want to follow the Lord’s will by combining His own will to their will. So our efforts should he according to the Lord’s will, being sure on each step what is the Lord’s will? What does the Lord want at this time? What should I do that the God will be pleased? By such practice there remains the memory of the Lord fresh in our heart and along with this there is the obedience of His command also.</p>
<p class="Text">‘Seeking-shelter’ means by detaching ourselves perfectly from the love in body, wife-son-riches etc., to concentrate our mind in the love of the Lord only. There should be the felling in our mind that in reality we have no other as our own in this world except the Lord. There is no other one than the lord whom I can say my own. It is only the Lord who is our kith and kin and everything for us, only he is serving our interest by all me means. He is our greatest well-wisher, greatest lover the highest kind-hearted, He is Omniscient; He is always ready to support us for our perfect good as soon as it is possible. The Lord is ready with vitality, intelligence and wisdom, knowledge and spiritual-prowess which are helpful in His attainment to grant us. He is not granting them to us to think us undeserving, but He makes efforts to make us worthy. Whatever the least worthiness in us is that is the Lord’s gift to us. As the mother-father remain interested in the development of their offsprings they support him by all means according to his capacity for his progress. Sometimes they don’t give him to think that their child will waste the wealth so there is his interest in not giving him. Equally in the same way, the Lord is even greater well wisher than the parents and remains always trying to bring improvement in us for our deliverance. We should be confident that if the Lord is so kind-hearted and so eager for our redemption then, where is the place for doubt in our deliverance. If we were not worthy the Lord would have not made us human beings there are other countless beings in other species of life. </p>
<p class="Text">Through His especial grace to us He has provided us this human body. As Tulasidasji has stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कबहुँक करि करुना नर देही। </p>
<p class="Shlok">देत ईस बिनु हेतु सनेही॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 7/44/6)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Rarely does God, who loves the Jiva without any self-interest graciously bestow on it a human form which is a veritable raft whereby it can cross the ocean of mundane existence.’ By revolving in the realm of eighty four lakh of the classes of births when Jiva is oppressively afflicted the Lord comes to feel pity on it. That Lord bestowing grace without any self-interest, loving all beings bestows on it a human form for our emancipation. The Lord has no selfish interest from us. Having got such a rare human body if we invest our time in the intoxication, in the enjoyment of worldly sensuous objects or in the evil deeds, then, we misuse the power given by Him. To do so is a great foolishness. Having it in our consideration instead of misusing it ever we should make its proper use. We should use this human body and power for that very purpose for which the Lord has bestowed it upon us. This is our greatest duty. To fulfill it is the second kind of seeking shelter to the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The third point is that being charmed in the Lord’s love we should continue the chanting of the Lord’s Name and meditating upon His form and continue self-study. We should always remain listening to episodes of the love devotion, faith, knowledge and dispassion of the Lord and continue uttering it and should never forget the Lord even for a moment Let us remain muttering His name either by speech or by breaths and remain meditating upon His form in the mind. Thus, remembering the Lord every moment. We should continue realizing the vision of the Lord. We should always keep our mind concentrated in remembering the Lord’s virtues, glory, frolicsome activities and His form and while thinking we should remain being charmed. To meditate the Lord in mind is to catch him with mind. To hymn His attributes and chant His Name by speech is to catch Him with speech and to establize Him in the heart by wisdom is to catch the Lord with the wisdom. Thus, we should always remain holding the Lord. Remaining absorbed in His love We should always continue developing our love in the Lord progressively. This is to catch the Lord with our heart. Thus never to leave the Lord from the hold of our heart, mind and wisdom is the third kind of seeking shelter to the Lord. If we make such practice our soul having been refined can attain the salvation very soon.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">The attainment of supreme peace by knowing the Lord—selfless friend to all beings</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Krishna states that—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 5/29)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the supreme Lord of all the worlds, and the disinterested friend of all beings, My devotee attains peace.</p>
<p class="Text">Here the word ‘Peace (Shanti) denotes emancipation and liberation which is called the Supreme state Brahma, The abode of eternal peace. The same has been related here by the name of ‘Shanti’ (the Supreme peace) The attainment of the Lord or the attainment of the Supreme bliss and the attainment of peace, all are the same in meaning.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is the ocean of mercy and the great lover without any interest. To know the Lord in this way is to know the Lord as the disinterested friend of all beings. Likewise His devotees too are disinterested lover and kind-hearted. Sketching the characteristics of the devotees Lord Shri Krishna states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्रः करुण एव च। </p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः समदुःखसुखः क्षमी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 12/13)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He who is free from malice towards all beings, friendly and compassionate, and free from the feelings of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, balanced in joy and sorrow, forgiving by nature—ever contented and mentally united with me nay, who has firm resolve and who has subdued his mind and reason to me—that devotee of mine is dear to Me.’</p>
<p class="Text">The dear devotees of the Lord are compassionate and friendly to all beings without the prejudiced mind. Mother, who loves her child, has attachment and selfish motive; but the lord’s devotees love all beings without the feeling of infatuation and attachment. They are free from the feeling of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. They have the pure love and pure compassion for all the beings. The word ‘Nirmam’ means here free from the sense of mine. The kindness of a cow for her calf and a mother’s for her child is on account of their sense of mineness for them but the devotees are free from the sense of mine. They are free from even the ego of ‘I am free from the sense of mine.’ So, being free from the feelings of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ they remain balanced in joy and serrow and are forgiving by nature. If anyone commits any offence they are not repulsive to take any revenge. These all are the feelings of selfless friendliness. When the Lord Rama gave the sermon like nectar to the citizens of Ayodhya, the residents of Ayodhya said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वारथ मीत सकल जग माहीं। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सपनेहुँ प्रभु परमारथ नाहीं॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">हेतु रहित जग जुग उपकारी। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तुम्ह तुम्हार सेवक असुरारी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 7/47/6-5)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Everyone else in this world has his own interest to serve; no one thinks of other’s spiritual interests even in a dream. You are the only disinterested benefactors in this world—yourself and your servants, O destroyer of the demons!’ Those who are great souls, are the disinterested benefactors by all means—by their body, mind and wealth. They do the good to others by adopting any way as may serve their interest. There remains ne cause for the Lord, He is verily the disinterested friend to all, but he also who has known this reality, becomes the selfless, friend, to all beings like the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">You are being related about the Lord’s disinterested friendliness. Whatever is happening that is the Lord’s will only. If this in reality comes to our mind, we can remain cheerful all the time. All the occurrences of the world are well planned. Suppose, it is raining then we should not desire that it should not be raining, if it is not raining then we should not desire that it should rain; because the Lord does only what is right and proper. Our desire cannot even cause the rain or stop raining, so it is worthless to desire it. You may say that it doesn’t rain when there is need of rain and it rains when it is not needed. The country that requires rain remains devoid of rain and it rains in the country which does not need rain-fall, it is right. This is your outlook. You think that the paddy that was sown requires rain, but you are micro, you paid your attention to only one side that there is the need of rain. Your mind is only on one side you look from the angle that if it rains the production will be much better. But if the Lord does not want the crop or paddy to grow, how will it rain? You cannot know ‘where is the paddy to be produced and where not?’ The Lord awards dispensation according to the actions of the ‘Jiva’ (beings). We have not to interfere in the Lord’s dispensation. If the mother beats her child and other one interferes her that she should not beat him as he weeps, is the child dearer to you and he is not dear to his mother? If you do who will support you? Mind it that the child is not so dear to you as dear he is to his mother who beats him, your love is only to a show. If the child is pleased at a time he will say that he favours me; but the interest of the child doesn’t lie there, the interest of the child is there in the beating of his mother. Why does the mother beat him? You didn’t understand it by thinking it seriously. The child is a rascal he beats other boys without any fault, he abuses. The mother persuades him but he does not care for his mother’s words. So, the mother beats him. Why does she beat, to make him to give up the bad habits. The mother doesn’t have the feeling of hostility against the child. Similarly, the Lord causes us suffering in our own interest to the extent the Lord thinks in our interest even the mother cannot go to that extent to think of child’s interest. There is the infatuation, ignorance and selfishness also in the mother’s mind. But in the Lord there is not even the scent of self-interest. His all the efforts and actions are in our interest we should remain always cheerful to see the lord’s dispensation for us. Whatever the occurrences are happening that is all the Lord’s sportive display. If this reality comes to our understanding, our cheerfulness may grow so much day by day that it will be difficult for us even to control it. In each and every atom only the Lord’s grace will be visible to us. The Lord’s grace and efforts somewhere comes to our understanding but sometimes it remains beyond our approach. When we fail to know and understand his decision by accepting it as the Lord’s will we come to understand it later on.</p>
<p class="Text">There were two real brothers. One of them was atheist and the other theist. The atheist one said—‘Your God did not do it right. He granted small fruits in the big trees as for example mango, jambu fruit, pipal, banyan etc., and watermelon and pumpkin etc., in the small trees. In the mean time one mango fell down on his head being detached from the tree. It would have been about quarter and half of one seer in weight, it caused a light hurt to his head He who was sitting near him said—‘Brother! If it had been of five seers in weight your head would have broken.’ The next brother said—Yes, brother, your God was quite right to do so, now, I have come to know the reality.’ By getting the hurt on one’s own self the Lord’s grace and efforts came to his understanding the atheist became theist. It should be well known in the mind that no mistake is possible by the Lord. Whatever the Lord does, He does it after well consideration. Whatever the God has given us, the objects whatever and how many he has given to us, that is all for our emancipation. This is sufficient and nothing extra is needed. If the Lord had thought of need he would have given us more.</p>
<p class="Text">Neither there is the need of wealth, nor son, nor wife and nor prosperity for God’s attainment whatever has been given to us by the Lord is sufficient in quantity. Really, so much was also not needed, but having his confidence in you the Lord gave you more than enough. Now, it is your duty to invest it in the Lord’s work Invest money for the Lord’s cause. Spend your money in the works of the highest welfare of peeple. Don’t be extravagant in your own personal life. This is your shop, think of it the Lord’s shop and not your own and invest money in the shop for the business purpose only what is needed for it, spend the rest of the Lords money in the works of the Lord. Use the space of the house only needed for you and the rest portion of the house or any other house belonging to you should be used in the interest of the public because, this house doesn’t belong to you, this is the Lord’s house. You think that this is your own house those who live here in this house in the forms of mice making hole in it think that this is their house. The birds having made their nest in this live here thinking that this is their house, the sparrow has made her nest in this house, she thinks of this house as her own, the wasps have made hives they think that this house is theirs the ants who live in it think that this is their house, but whose house is this? In reality this house does not belong to anyone.</p>
<p class="Shlok">'न घर तेरा न घर मेरा,</p>
<p class="Shlok">चिड़िया रैन-बसेरा है।'</p>
<p class="Text">‘This house of this world neither belongs to you nor to me. This is a night-shelter.’ As the birds come and make their nests on branch of a tree and live there, similarly this is a shelter of a short time for you. So in this short period of your right the work of the Lords attainment should be completed soon. As it may be used for the Lord’s attainment, it should be provided to other’s use for divine worship or communian with saints. Whatever wisdom you have, it should be engaged in the attainment of the Lord. The mystery and truth of the Supreme Being should be realized by our mind and wit. The work of wisdom is to realize and know by using our wisdom we should know the attributes and influence of the Lord. Use your tongue in the congregational singing of the Lord’s name and praise use your ears in listening to the Lord’s attributes, glory mystery and truth and the Lord’s Name—form and character. Use your eyes in seeing the Lord’s favorite’s mythological scriptures and books—in reading those books which consist of subjects of meditation, detachment and devotion and which are helpful in the Lord’s attainment; concentrate your mind to the Lord’s meditation Engage your hands in the service of all beings considering them as the forms of God. Thus, make the proper use of all the body and sense organs that is why the Lord has endowed on us all these properties. If the money is lost one should not worry, because you didn’t invest the money given to you by the Lord in the right work, so the Lord took it back. The second point is that this money was a hindrance in the Lord’s achievement. The Lord had given you this money for the redemption of the soul and you spent it in the worldly enjoyments, so this money proved hurdle for you. You were much persuaded through the scriptures and saints also, but you didn’t pay heed to anyone then, lord got it back. It has happened in your interest. You did not use it properly, you misused it, so the lord has saved you from the sin.</p>
<p class="Text">The worldly enjoyments and the sinful deeds, both are obstacle in deliverance. The Lord blessed you with a son to give him the teachings of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> to give the lessons of remembering the lord’s name, as someone teaches parrot and starling and teaches them to repeat the Lord’s name—‘Narayan Narayan or Hare Rama Hare Rama.’ If even the birds are taught then, whether your son is not even like birds. The children should be taught to repeat the Lord’s name. The spiritual matters should be made listen to their ears. He should be given lesson of only such subjects that your son may become the devotee of the Lord, here lies even your highest good as well as your son’s highest good also and along with it there is the highest good of other beings also. You don’t give him this noble lesson and your son is growing insolent day by day. He does not worth doing works he does what should not be done, this is impertinence, this is heedlessness. If your son becomes rogue, it will be harmful for you in future. There may not be created any disturbance in your spiritual discipline of the present and future so the Lord killed him, called him to his abode. There lies your interest; you don’t understand this fact so much as much the Lord understands it. So, you should not use your reason here. Whatever the Lord did that was good.</p>
<p class="Text">Man should minimize his needs, it makes his salvation possible very soon and when the Lord minimizes his needs, no doubt there is also lies his highest good but it takes time. You are the owner of a great wealth, utilize that wealth in the interest of others and spend less in your own livelihood this is the path that will lead you to your welfare. If you do otherwise then it is the reverse path. If you spend money in evil deeds or in causing harm to others, or you spend it in fulfilling your sexual desires and in the intoxication, its result is always sin. To save you from the sin the Lord destroyed your wealth. As the moths rush on the electric light and as a result they die. They fall on the lantern and lamp also and die. Then you think how to save their life, you adopt many means but they don’t stop coming and falling on it thus, they remain dying. Thinking thus, you put out the lamp, switch off the light and thus, they are saved; the moths dislike your action very much; because the moths think that they are enjoying pleasure and who created disturbance. Although the man who puts out the lamp and makes the switch off, serves their interest. Saves their life even then the moths don’t understand it. Similarly we don’t understand like the moths. The Lord destroys the heap of the worldly enjoyments—money, Gold,  ladies, touch, appearance and sap, scent—in our interest only, otherwise we would have entangled ourselves in these and would have died. The Lord marked it that he got himself entangled into the objects of material enjoyments and worldly comports badly and still he is going in indulging. We began to misuse them so the Lord did well to do so.</p>
<p class="Text">It is best for us to hand over the God-gifted objects to the God Himself. Because the Lord has given us freedom to handover, so we should think. Lord! You provided me all the possible objects but I am not worthy of it so, I surrender all your given objects to you. This is honesty. This leads to his redemption very soon. To invest in the Lord’s work, to withdraw the ownership from it is to return to the Lord. As she is my wife, this is my house, this in my money, this is my body—here is the attachment or affinity. We don’t have the affinity with whole world, there is not the sense of mineness. We don’t feel sorrow if any object with which we have no affinity is destroyed by if the object which we think that is my own, if it is destroyed we feel shattered. Surrender those some objects also to the Lord which you think as your own and have great attachment with them. Whose house is this? It belongs to God and not to you. Whom do you, yourself, belong to? To the Lord. Whose wife is this? She is of the Lord, whose property is this? the Lord’s property. A few objects to which you are attached, if you withdraw your attachment from these, then in the absence of such attachment you may get deliverance simultaneously. As there is a bubble in the sea, it has got it’s relation is to that space only where it is present from the rest it is free. This world is also like an ocean, we are detached from the whole world, there is a limited place where we are attached. The Lord has already removed you from the rest. This ia s great graceful favour of the Lord that he has seized your right of the world, now your right is limited to a very limited place that is on your body. Things related to this body are body and mind which you have misunderstood as your own. How big and broad is the ocean and how big is the bubble think that the bubble is like a pearl and the sea is boundless. So take the world a bottomless sea. You are liberated from the world whether  anyone remains alive or dies, whether it occurs the Cosmic dissolution, there is no worry to anyone for this limited to a little space you created your attachment with the pearl of bubble. The Lord snatched the attachment of the whole world from you, mow there a very little hurdle in your deliverance now, kindly remove that hurdle of attachment also. And think that you got deliverance.</p>
<p class="Text">It is you only who are responsible for your bond. The Lord is graceful to you that He detached you from your attachments. At least this was the Lord’s grace on you. Now, it is your job to oblige yourself. Pray to the Lord—‘Lord! It was your great blessing on me that you did a very good work to free me from attachments. As my attachment is limited to a limit, that also I myself, detach, there after dedicate yourself as well as the objects to which you think as your own belonging to the Lord. Include them in the creation. All that what we see in this world and the objects on which we claim our right belongs to the Lord. We are equal-minded whether a son is born or a daughte is born in any family. If anyone comes late we ask him. Why are you late today? He answers, ‘A girl was born in my family and I became busy. It is right, brother, she has got her own destiny to pull on. When a girl comes to this world she has her own fate with her we give him such sermon. Someone says—‘I was not present for a week. My son had died’. Then I tell him nothing matters. Your company with him was destined only for this short period. We become the saint as there were saints and sages. He has such a firm faith in his mind that there is neither his son nor his daughter. He is free from worry, anguish, sorrow and joy. There is nothing our own in this world. How we have the feeling of equanimity for all beings. Where is our inequality? It is there where we have attachment. Throughout the day it goes on happening favourable or disfavourable. In favourable happening we feel pleasure in unfavourable we feel pain. We remain suffering from the emotion of joy, anguish, love, hatred throughout the day. It was the grace of the Lord that He kept us deprived of the attachment to the whole world otherwise we would have faced the difficulty beyond imagination. Now your attachment has been confined to a limit only, detach your affinity from there. The moment you got detached from the worldly objects, you would be a great soul, you would be the enlightened one. Those who are called Sadhus leave their house. He sacrificed everything, he became free from all the attachments, he should get salvation. That Sadhu first left his house but his attachment to the house and other family members subsisted, he could not give up his attachment to them, he left the house and became a Sadhu. If any one of the village visited him, he asked him do you know that particular man?’ He said—‘Yes, I know’—He says then, ‘He is my son. Whether all are well.’ Then the visitor says—‘Yes, all are well and happy there were three brothers one of them died and there are the rest two remaining.’ How did one die? ‘The robbers came and having killed him they took away his entire wealth. They committed serious; did henious crime.’ Still he has attachment that he regard his own home, his money and sons. He became Sadhu having left all. He departed from his house, but he went away with attachment and infatuation with the family and house. If you have left everything then, why do you recollect it? You filled your body with more attachment than even that having collected it from there. The visitor asked—‘Where do you live here?’ I live in hermitage. He came to his hermitage. Is it your hermitage? Yes, this hut is getting dilapidated. Yes, brother, it is getting dilapidated, you are kind-hearted, if you think it proper, get it renovated. He said—‘I don’t have money.’ ‘Well, then, try to get it constructed by any rich man’. ‘He said—‘Well, Babaji, if I could get opportunity, I will talk.’ Then, who is there to take trouble of renovation? The people brought alms for the Sadhu, ‘Brother! What have you brought?’ Today it was the day of the annual offering in the name of the deceased relatives, so I have brought ‘Halwa-puri’ you did very well the Halwa (of flour mixed with ghee, sugar) is very tasty. Your some brother used to come with you. He was a great lover. Nowadays he doesn’t come with alms to give me.’ Well Maharaj! If he meets me I will tell him. ‘He brought the alms both the times.’ Nowadays, I have become physically weak, sometimes, I feel some need of milk also, but I don’t have money. ‘Well maharaj! If possible I myself, will bring it.’ Now, this attachment was transferred from the sons to those who serve. The same attachment what was for the home had come to the hermitage and the attachment of his family members came to his body. Our own body should survive well, let the whole world die. Whether you live in a narrow sphere or in a broad sphere the ‘sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ both are the cause of bond. If the scope in broader, there is more attachment and if the scope is narrow there will be less attachment, but the bond remains in both the situations everywhere. The emancipation of the man of the much affluence is very difficult if he has attachment. In the same way the redemption of the kings and Emperors is even more difficult than that of the men of rich prosperity. The salvation of the man who has limited attachment is easy. But so long as there is the feeling of ‘I’ and mine in this body the liberation is difficult—infatuation in body and longings, the peace is far away from him and there is no question of deliverance.’</p>
<p class="Text">The sense is that the outer sacrifice is good but so long as there is the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ and there is attachment in the worldly objects, and the body and, there is desire in the mind, perfect peace is far away from him. Where there is the abandonment all these, there is peace and peace only.</p>
<p class="Shlok">विहाय कामान् यः सर्वान् पुमांश्चरति निःस्पृहः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः स शान्तिमधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 2/71)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He who has given up all desires, and moves free from attachment, egoism and thirst for enjoyment, attains peace.’ </p>
<p class="Text">When the everything of own self is surrendered to the Lord, the peace is attained then. In a few things you have the infatuation, egoism, attachment, desires—you should give them up means surrender them all to the Lord. If you could do so, it means the supreme Lord was attained to you at that very time.’ How to recognize it? To recognize it is very clear. Where you have egoism and attachment you feel pleasure and anguish in gain and loss respectively. In your neighbourhood or in the market there are so many shops, some incur Loss and some earn profit. Do you know it what was profit and loss to whom this year? If he comes and lells you about his profit or loss do you feel delight and anguish?  You don’t feel. Similarly whatever gain or loss is there in your shop, then it remain balanced, it means the entire has already been surrendered to the Lord. This is the obvious proof—it is the criteria. As in another part of your town a son was born or a daughter was born in another family, someone died in any family and the news reached you. Has it any effect on you? Nothing. Similarly if any one dies in your family, it should also have the same effect on your mind. If you think that this is your responsibility that if one dies you have to get the shroud provided for him, if there is any birth you are to get the maid nurse called because this is your duty. In your house or in your neighborhood there lives someone and there is no male member in the family, someone dies in the family, will you not lift the body, whether it is your duty or not? Equally like the same if anyone dies in the neighbouring family it is your moral duty to perform his funeral rites similarly if anyone dies in your own family take him to the cremation ground and burn him. What is difference in both the cases? There is no restriction in burning the dead body. If it is needed to call a doctor for the neighboring family, call the doctor, if it is needed in your own family, then also call the doctor, but you should not feel any difference between the both loss because that had already been surrendered to the Lord beforehand, you handed it over to the Lord, that also became the Lord’s belonging. Both were in the same position, so the feeling should be equal for the both. It should be understood that here all have already been surrendered to the Lord whatever is happening consider it the Lord’s frolicsome display we should remain more cheerful. Whatever the work is going on we should remain overjoyed to see it.</p>
<p class="Text">If fire broke out in anyone’s house, even then should we be happy? No, in such a situation it is your duty to extinguish the fire and this is the moral duty of the wise men to persuade and console them who weeps for this due to their ignorance. But if you rejoice going there, well very well! Whether it will give joy or sorrow to the man whose house has caught fire. Did you extinguish the fire or set his heart on fire? In such a condition it becomes your duty to extinguish the fire if the fire has broken out in any one’s house. The fire broke out outwardly but you are burning his inner sense by expressing your joy. The matter of joy is neither to enjoy nor to speak. The savants and saints remain always cheerful. Do they get it proclaimed on the beat of drum? You should go on remaining cheerful to see the frolicsome activities of the Lord, but the outer behaviour should be according to the command of the Lord only. It should be the utmost effort to give comfort and pleasure to others. The joy and sorrow of the ignorant persons who are affected by joy and sorrow should be shared. He who is happy in the happiness of others and grieved with the grief of others, is the real devotee of the Lord. Here the sense is that there is an inner feeling and another is the outer behaviour. In the inner sense let us remain aways very cheerful considering all the happenings of the world as frolicsome display of the Lord. There should never come any diminution in our cheerfulness and as regards the outer behaviour we should do such as may give happiness to others by any way possible. There is no effect on us if the whole world be burnt to ashes, but if the others are afflicted with grief we should not cause grief to them rather they should be comforted and consoled. Whatever is being done by the Lord is always in the interest of all beings. If any doctor is operating a child and the child is crying, the child should be admonished that the operation is in his interest; it will give a good result to him. He should not weep. Similarly in other case, if someone’s child has died he should think that is the result of his fate, he should not weep for this. What is gain from worry? The Lord’s dispensation  is always auspicious, there also lies his welfare though he does not understand it. All the actions from the Lords side are the source of joy and joy only, that joy is visible to devotee, it is not visible to everyone—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदृच्छालाभसंतुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">समः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 4/22)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Karmyogi, who is contented with whatever is got unsought, is free from jealousy and has transcended all pairs of opposites like joy and grief and is equipoised in success and failure, is not bound by his action.’</p>
<p class="Shlok">संतुष्टः सततं योगी यतात्मा दृढनिश्चयः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्तः स मे प्रियः॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 12/14)</p>
<p class="Text"> The Lord states—‘The Yogi means the devotee of the Lord, ever contented and mentally united with Me, nay, who has subdued his mind, senses and body, has a firm resolve, and has surrendered his mind and reason to Me—that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.’ In his mind and reason he has a firm resolve and in accordance to his firm resolve he contemplates the Lord, he is mentally united with the Lord and sees Him everywhere. First he perceives the Lord’s grace everywhere. The Lord states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 5/29)</p>
<p class="Text"> ‘Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the supreme Lord of all the world, and the disinterested friend of all beings. My devotee attains peace.’ </p>
<p class="Text">So we should see the Lord’s grace on all the beings. God’s mercy inheres in all actions and objects. The devotee remains seeing the Lord’s grace, he remains ever cheerful to see His grace. Ever seeing the Lord’s grace he is so much overjoyed that his body begins to horripilate, tears begin to flow from his eyes. And then the Lord becomes visible to him everywhere—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">The mystery of Lord’s Mercy and Love</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord appears before the sight of that devotee at once, who has intense love or the Supreme devotion for the Lord or who has the keen desire or intense eagerness to meet Him. This is proper and just also. The Lord is bound to appear before the sight of such devotees. The Lord, Himself has stated in eleventh chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> (11/54) with the single minded devotion I can be seen in this form (with four arms), O valiant Arjuna. When the single minded devotion develops in the mind for the Lord, the exclusive love, only the pure love for the Lord develops in the heart. By reaching such a climax of love and devotion the intense desire to meet the Lord is created in the mind. When the desire to meet the Lord becomes intense there is created the earnestness in the spiritual practice and eagerness is created. Then the Lord appears at the very time. But without the exclusive love and keen desire also the Lord favours with his sight. Such men who have the supreme reverence and exclusive love for the Lord and intense desire and eagerness to meet the Lord are worthy of the Lord’s sight but what is that condition when the Lord showers his grace on him also who is unworthy of his sight even? The acceptance that the Lord showers His mercy and love without any motive and He is selfless friendly to all beings—On the ground of this acceptance even the unworthy men are also blessed with His sight. The Lord graces with His sight to him who is confident that the Lord is extremely kind-hearted and graces his sight to the unworthily also. To show mercy to the worthy one is verily justice no doubt. In such a situation how to liberate the sinners? If even a sinner also comes to realize that the Lord is kind then even the vilest sinner becomes entitled of Lord’s sight and such a confidence may develop in his mind that the Lord ignores the errors of His servants. By His grace even the unworthily gets the vision of His form.</p>
<p class="Text">‘The Lord is selfless friendly to all beings’—its firm resolve itself is the indicative that even the sinners attain the Lord’s sight. By the firm conviction in the mind that the Lord is kind-hearted and liberal, howsoever that man may be, the Lord does not look towards his faults at all. As a mother is the supremely kind hearted and she does not look the fault of her child, she only loves him. The same outlook about the Lord also is very important, because the Lord is of very tender nature, He is the embodiment of mercy and love and He is the ocean of mercy and love, the Lord is extremely compassionate etc., and He showers his compassion and love to all beings unmotivated. Such a recognition is very beneficial. The Lord knows it that he has such a faith in him, so He should change Himself accordingly for him. In the Gita the Lord Himself has stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">'ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।'</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 4/11)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Arjuna, howsoever men seek Me, even so do I approach them.’</p>
<p class="Text">But contrary to it if anyone commits sin on the pretext of the Lord’s compassion, that sin becomes impenetrable and that sin is never destroyed. By the above mentioned conviction the sins of the past are destroyed, but in future no sin of any kind should he committed. For this purpose he should read the Lord’s words in the books again and again, he should listen them from the mouths of the great souls and should ponder over them with reverence. In the Gita the Lord has stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 5/29)</p>

<p class="Text">‘Uma there is no such friend as Shri Rama in this world—neither a preceptor, nor father, nor mother, nor brother, nor master.’</p>
<p class="Text">Listen to such references again and again and remember the Lord’s Nature as how kind and lover is the Lord! As there in the world someone is excessively kind-hearted. A selfish man takes improper advantage of his kindness, similarly we should take advantage from the Lord. So accept the Lord in  the same spirit. In reality, the Lord is of such nature. The Lord is so compassionate that He cannot bear the grief of his votary, cannot bear to see it. The Lord’s heart is extremely tender. Bharataji Maharaj says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन अवगुन प्रभु मान न काऊ। </p>
<p class="Shlok">दीन बंधु अति मृदुल सुभाऊ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 7/1/6)</p>
<p class="Text"> ‘But, being a friend of the humble and most tender-hearted Lord never takes into account the faults of His devotees.’</p>
<p class="Text">What a high spirit of emotion is there in the talks of Bharatji! He says—‘Lord! If you take into account my faults, there is no way of my deliverance for hundred crores of epochs, but you don’t mind my faults at all—this is only the prop for me! Your nature is so tender that you cannot bear to see your devotees in trouble. You are the friend of the meek and humble. Whatever feelings of impatience, humbleness, and pity are there in the inner sense of man, have their great importance. Those who have such emotions in their heart, are worthy of the Lord’s grace. Even the vilest sinner becomes worthy of the Lord’s grace, it means that undeserving becomes deserving. As anyone has such an attitude for anybody in his mind, he is very kind-hearted, he is very generous, then, the man who has such a feeling in his heart takes maximum advantage from that man of generous character. That man of liberal nature thinks that he has so much confidence in him he has such a high opinion about him so he should return in the same coin. Thus, his heart is changed, and for him even less kind and liberal man becomes more kind and more liberal. The Lord is liberal in reality. Thus, he who has the firm faith in the Lord that God is so kind-hearted, so graceful and then the man thinking of the Lord as the Supreme, becomes worthy of His grace. The Lord in fact is of the same mind. We are lacking in availing of Him. We do say that the Lord is very kind-hearted and at the same time we know it also that despite being kind-hearted He is in favour of justice. When we think that being compassionate, the Lord does justice and thus we are benefited only according to his rule of justice. We understand it that this is the Policy of the Lord. No doubt, this is His policy but before the love this principle does not stay. So, he who thinks that the Lord is kind-hearted, a great lover there the Lord overlooks His principle for such devotee. The Lord is the store  house of mercy and love. By thinking of the Lord as kind-hearted man takes the maximum benefit of His compassion. He should realize that he is not worthy by any way but the Lord liberates him also who is undeserving and unworthy. Thus, there is a special concession in the Lord’s abode there is a special law. This is also a system. He who has such recognition and who has firm faith regarding this matter, can take the special benefit. Those who worship Him by chanting the devotional song or making practice of the spiritual discipline if they take benefit that is quite justified because the Lord is excessively kind-hearted that he, Himself floats away in the flood of compassion and mercy. When his heart is moved with emotion of compassion, the Lord does not still care for the rule of justice and ethics. According to ethical rules he does not deserve the lord’s mercy but the Lord does not do so. The Lord is master of all who is to check Him? The demon lady like putana who had come to suckle poison to the Lord, the Lord emancipated even her also. Now, it should be thought how kind-hearted the Lord is! Putana had not thought even in her imagination that she would attain salvation. The Lord has the consideration in the mind that who has come in His contact must get deliverance. Thus, he who knows the Lord and his nature takes more benefit from him.</p>
<p class="Text">The same position is in the case of love. He who comes to know that the Lord bestows his love without any motive and there is abundance of love in him, in such a situation if the love of the whole world is collected together that is not equal even to a drop of the ocean of His love. The Lord is such a lover He pays the value of love so much as cannot be paid by any other one, and none cannot give that such regard as He gives. I don’t have love but this is my conviction that the Lord values love very much. I think that he who loves the Lord even a little, the Lord becomes his subservient in return. Whosoever has this recognition, that much price of love the Lord pays, cannot be paid so much value by any other one in the world. That man loves only the lord and none else. Only having known this the exclusive and pure love for the Lord develops in anyone’s heart he attains God. So it should be in our mind that it is the Lord only the sole lover. He loves without any cause. He has no Self-interest at all. It is the Lord’s nature to love. He who having such a faith and loves the Lord exclusively obtains its benefit positively. And who knows this does take its benefit those who in reality have love in the lord are above appreciation.</p>
<p class="Text">Question—What is the difference between knowing and believing?</p>
<p class="Text">Answer—First, there is belief or faith and then comes knowledge to us. First accept it or agree to it that the Lord is such a lover and there is no lover superior or even equal to Him in this world. Who has the least love in the Lord, the Lord stands at his beck and call being compelled by His nature, The Lord gives the unexpected price of a bit of love, none gives so high price. There is none in the world who may pay such a high price of the love—it is the Lord only such a payer. The love of worldly people is not even equal to one percent of love of God. In other word, the worldly love is meaningless. When such a firm faith develops in the mind, only than there is such recognition. Such firm faith transforms into knowledge later on. At the time of the knowledge of the nature of the Supreme Lord, such an immense joy and peace is attained that has no bound. At the time of such belief for the Lord, it seems to him (who has realized) that he was quite unaware of the fact that the Lord is such and did not even believe so. He takes it in this way that it is the grace of the great souls who guided such a way, the scriptures are very graceful that such truth could be available in the scriptures to read and he feels overjoyed. He gets ever more joy than the joy he gets when he receives any hidden wealth. Wealth is a very trivial thing but for a greedy man that is the most precious. That is why the wealth is given as example. Such recognition is formed by devotion and by faith. Such a faith develops by hearing, by reading by the purification of inner organ and by the Lords grace.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is graceful to all. He who realizes in his heart that the Lord is graceful to all, becomes worthly—he becomes worthy of Lord’s grace. The Lord is especially graceful to him. The Lord is the supreme lover, the foremost kind-hearted, the lover and graceful without any cause, to shower mercy and to love is His nature. As sun’s nature is to give light and heat, similarly is the nature of the Lord that he is compassionate and loves without any cause. He who has such recognition about the sun, takes more advantage from the sun. In the same way who has such acceptance in his mind about the Lord takes the special benefit from the Lord. He knows that there is nowhere such a bright light as in the sun and there is the excess of heat in the sun light. It he needs warmth he takes it from the sunlight. Similarly a devoted takes benefit from the Lord and seeks His shelter. The Lord is extremely kind-hearted, a great lover and disinterested He showers without begging. Really, where is the question for asking such kindness Such is the nature of the saints and the great souls whose love is to serve and do good to all the beings. As is the nature of saints so noble, saintly and holy, so is the Lord’s nature even more than that of those.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who is not saintly, he lacks in merits but the others have faith in him they accept him a great soul wholeheartedly, for them he is an exalted soul only in true sense; because he thinks that they regard him as great soul, at that time he should practice the same great soul’s behavior with them. In their eyes he is a great soul, they should be gainer according to their faith and devotion thus, he who is not a great soul who has shortcomings but lives a superior saintly life for others. But the lord is in reality even the great soul of the great souls and the supreme most-In reality whatever image of the Lord one forms in his mind, the Lord approaches him in the same image and he becomes deserving. The belief is such to that undeserving, it makes as the deserving. The unworthy becomes worthy. The feeling and sentiment what is there in his mind of the being, transforms the undeserving to deserving. of anyone is not reliable, but I rely on him thinking in my mind that he is reliable then even that unreliable man becomes reliable to me on the support of my mental recognition; because he tries to improve himself and becomes reliable. If even he does not improve but he shows himself improved at least before me, because he understands that I rely on him, he believes me reliable so he should be reliable to me. And as regards the Lord, He is most reliable, there is no lackness in him at all.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is definitely attainable to His lover, but where is the love in me? But I feel that Lord will not mind my faults, I have definitely shortcomings in me but the Lord does not see my weaknesses; what is that he marks that how much is his faith in him. How is his belief in him. So our faith in respect of the Lord should be made more firm.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is the most kind-hearted and He is extremely graceful to us. In this reference there is a story* which is in brief as follows—</p>
<p class="Text">A Kshatriya boy’s devotion and reverent sentiment of high category developed in his heart for the king of that country after the death of his parents due to their teaching to him and he did not feel the least worry or anguish in his mind, because he saw all the actions of the king were in his own interest. The king’s, courtiers and senior officials also came to know it, as a result with their consent; the king made him the prince of the state which was beyond his imagination.</p>
<p class="Text">By this example we should understand who is the king? The king is the Supreme Lord. And the boy? The man who believes that the Lord is very kind-hearted and a great lover without any cause, He showers his mercy and love even on them who don’t deserve. The courtiers who were the members of his cabinet among whom there was a teacher also, all of them are the exclusive devotees of the Lord and those who were his class-fellows are the well-wishers and friends of this world. His preceptors are his mother-father who are the great souls who usually remain giving good teachings. They say that the majesty king means the Lord is very kind-hearted and great lover, He shows His compassion and love without any  motive. Now let us take lesson from this example that as that boy had no presumption that he would be coronated as a prince, he had not imagined even in his dream that the king would award him the position of the prince, similarly he who believes that the Lord is graceful to him and loves him deeply who is graceful and lover without selfish motive, the result of which is that he attains the position of prince means he attains the Supreme Lord. The attainment of Supreme state is to have the attainment of the state of prince. It means that it is even beyond imaginations that this is the fruit of such firm acceptance there the context is to have conviction and to have faith in the mind, that I am undeserving, really, I don’t deserve by anyway but the Lord is so kind-hearted that He does the highest good to him even who is undeserving. How much his  conviction is about the Lord. That conviction got him such benefit which was beyond the imagination. The topic had started by what conviction how does an undeserving or unworthy man become  entitled of the Lord’s attainment? He always remains cheerful by holding such view that the Lord is so kind to me, He is so graceful to me, the Lord is so kind-hearted, such a great lover. To remain being charmed moment after moment and to be cheerful with this firm conviction in mind this sentiment makes him worthy of attaining the Lord. This is about firm belief. That Kshatriya boy had no knowledge, this was his presumption on the basis of the precepts he had from his mother-father. So, like that boy we should also have the same sentiment in our mind to hear the sermons of the saints that the Lord is such-the Lord is such and have faith in him in reality that is the truth and if we develop such belief for the Lord in our heart we too become worthy similarly, we can become there is nothing strange about it. What did we spend from our pocket? Such faith about the Lord imbibed in our mind makes even the unworthy worthy. To look forward the Lord’s grace on us again and again to become cheerful and with the understanding that the Lord is loving without any selfish motive. To be cheerful after hearing so and accepting it to be cheerful is only the matter of devotion and love. As is the reverent faith so is the fruit. There comes the saying in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Ramacharitamanasa</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तात स्वर्ग अपबर्ग सुख धरिअ तुला एक अंग। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तूल न ताहि सकल मिलि जो सुख लव सतसंग॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 5/4)</p>
<p class="Text">‘In one scale of the balance, my dear, put together the delight of heaven and the bliss of final beatitude; but they will all be outweighed (placed in the other pan of the scale) by a moment’s joy derived from communion with saints.’</p>
<p class="Text">How is that company of great souls? ‘Sat’ means the company of Supreme Being is Satsanga of the first category and the second category is the company of the great souls who have already realized God. That is also mostly like the first one; but there should be faith and devotion in those great souls and there should be the conviction in the mind that their company is superior to salvation. He, who has such a faith, gets such a peace and happiness which has no limit only by their vision and he is charmed to see every activity of that exalted soul. All his activities appear to him like the frolicsome activities and he remains going on charmed every moment to see it. All the activities of Lord Krishna appeared as plays to the Gopis similarly all actions of the great soul appear to the reverent being as pastimes. He is overwhelmed with the charm so much that it takes only a moment for him to realize the spiritual truth and attain the Supreme Being, he concludes in his mind that there is none in this world like the perfect soul.</p>
<p class="Text">When Garuda was over powered by infatuation and he was going to take the sermons Lord Shiv happened to meet him on the way. Lord Shiv said to him, ‘I am going with an urgent piece of work, you should go and approach ‘Kakabhushundi’ he is very proficient. Garudaji had faith in the words of Shivji and he reached the hermitage of Kakabhushundi and just reaching there he felt such a peace, such a joy, such a happiness that had no limit. At that time Kakabhushundiji asked him—‘You have visited me, what is your purpose that I should fulfil?’ Garudaji said—‘The purpose why I visited you was accomplished only by your sight—it was done merely by visiting your hermitage.’ Now please, relate me the Lord’s story.’ It proves that Garudaji had developed a great devotion to hear the words of Shivji and it was the influence of that devotion that the purpose for which he had visited was accomplished in a moment merely by the sight of Kakabhushundiji. It proves that our emancipation is attained in a moment. Garudaji’s infatuation had disappeared. Kakabhushundiji was the great soul of the highest rank and Shivji’s words proved beneficial. The faith developed in him. By the creation of faith his purpose was fulfilled in a moment. But without faith his purpose would have been never served. As Lord Shiv said to his wife Sati–‘Ramachandraji is apparent Supreme Being, but she did not believe and she went to test him. The result of her test was that she had to sacrifice her life in the ‘Yagya’ of Prajapati. Garudaji had his confidence in the words of Shivaji so it took only a moment in his salvation, so it is the faith only what is main. Shivaji had told to Sati also that He was apparently God and had told to Garudaji also that Kakabhushundi was a great soul. Shri Ramachandraji was already the great soul of great souls apparently Maryada Purushottam the apparent Supreme Brahma and God Himself. So, it should he kept in mind that the faith is prime and belief with devotion is faith. That whatever the nature of the faith verily man is that. In the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>, Lord Shri Krishna had stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्धः स एव सः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 17/3)</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">‘The faith of all men conforms to their mental disposition, Arjuna. Faith constitutes a man; whatever nature of his faith, verily he is that’. So, having firm faith in the love and grace of the Lord we should take more advantage.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">The usefulness of Human-body</p>
<p class="Text">Having full faith and conviction in the words of the Lord as well as the saints we should make whole-hearted efforts accordingly. Then, there is no question of delay in our deliverance. About the demoniac property and its result the Lord has stated in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">दम्भो दर्पोऽभिमानश्च क्रोधः पारुष्यमेव च। </p>
<p class="Shlok">अज्ञानं चाभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम्॥ </p>

<p class="Text">‘Hypocrisy, arrogance, pride and anger, harshness and ignorance too—these are the marks of him, who is born with demoniac properties.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Failing to reach Me, Arjuna these stupid persons are born life after life in demoniac wombs and then verily sink down to still lower planes.’</p>
<p class="Text">It means to say that such these sinners are born in demoniac wombs in the animal, birds, insect, moth species life after life and having remained deprived of Me they verily sink down to still lower planes—the hades like ‘Raurava’ ‘Mahararaurava’ ‘Kumbhipaka’ etc. So, if we believe in these words then how is it possible that the vices and misconducts of demoniac wombs can approach us and how can we bear to see them? As for example, we go to the market and if there is any market of demoniac objects—meat, wine etc. then we leave that path from a distance; we leave that way also that leads to the market of eggs fish etc. To eat them is the matter of farfetched affair. We don’t touch them. We consider sin even to touch them. Equally like that if a man gives up the evil deeds—To tell a lie, to commit theft to drink wine, to eat meat etc., all the sinful acts from a distance, these vices cannot even touch them. As the darkness cannot exist before the sun, similarly no mark of demoniac property can reach near the divine property.</p>
<p class="Text">Likewise, the demerits and ill feelings of the heart lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, attachment and aversion etc. cannot enter the man of divine property. For this also the Lord states—Desire anger and greed—all these are three direct gateway of the Hell—they are the doors of lower planes. They lead us to hell. They bring about the downfall of the soul. Shun all these three.</p>
<p class="Text">The sex leads us to the gate of hell through winching and anger leads to the hell through violence greed leads to the hell through lie, deceit and dishonesty. All these lead us to hades. Having faith in the words of the Lord. Thus, when a man comes to know that such vile deeds will lead him to hell, why will he give them an opportunity? Evil thoughts and evil deeds etc., are the sinful acts. So, let us have faith in the words of scriptures that sin-vices-bad addictions are very bad—we should give them up completely at all. Besides this let us give up laziness, heedlessness, sins, demerits, bad conduct and the enjoyments and luxurie also. Due to not shunning them, the sins are created later on in future. Such precepts are available to us in the form of sermons in the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita, Bhagavat, Mahabharata </span>and other scriptures. Having faith in them we should determine it in our mind that these are harmful to us and thinking so we should give up them. It requires a single minute only. Think over in a minute that ‘whatever was done till now, I washed it away by taking bath in the Ganga and in future it will not be repeated. When you already took bath in the Ganga all the sins of the past, all the vices—all burnt to ashes. In future I have not to go on this path, not to do so at all, the sins of the past have been washed away then this Yagya was completed. The practice of such a spiritual exercise is called. ‘Yagya’. In the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span>, the Lord has stated—</p>
<p class="Shlok">गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">यज्ञायाचरतः कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 4/23)</p>
<p class="Text">‘All his actions melt away, who is free from attachment, who has no identification with the Body and does not claim it as his own, whose mind is established in the knowledge of self and who works merely for the sake of sacrifice.’ </p>
<p class="Text">By such spiritual practice all the inauspicious and sinful deeds of the past and present are destroyed—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘समग्रं प्रविलीयते’</span> (all his actions melt away) and the striver begins to practise the spiritual exercise to attain the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who surrenders his noble deeds to the Lord, is not caused to suffer the result of his bad deeds also by the Lord. He who says—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘श्रीकृष्णार्पणामस्तु’</span> (O Lord! whatever the sacrifices and the charities I have performed, I hereby surrender them all to you. ‘It requires only this much time. If we surrender the entire noble and auspicious done in this birth before births in the past to the Lord. God pardons all our sins. It involves no time. Thus whatever the sacred deeds, in all our births we have done, offer them all in a moment. Thus, what virtuous deeds in the form of Yagyas, charity or penance, we offer to God, In a moment the Lord sets us free from the bondage, virtuous and sins simultaneously.’ The Lord himself has stated In the <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> (9/27)—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत्करोषि यदश्नासि यज्जुहोषि ददासि यत्।</p>

When the account of our actions is cleared off means we got deliverance, how easy it is! To offer all the righteous actions done by us in the last thousands of births of the past to the Lord is the work of a moment. In a moment, offer your all the righteous acts of the past birth, you will be freed from the bonds of both the actions whether virtuous or sinful forever. These are the Lord’s utterances not mine. Tell me what time was spent in redemption. If a man comes to know this Mystery and realize the truth and thus, sacrifice the fruit of his virtuous actions, he will be bestowed with the fruit of his sacrifice.</p>
<p class="Text">The sacrifice of the fruits of actions is superior to the Lord’s meditation, because we get peace by renunciation—the supreme peace is attained—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानाकर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 12/12)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Meditation on God is superior to knowledge, and renunciation of the fruit of actions is even superior to meditation; for peace immediately follows from renunciation.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, we should offer our all actions to the Lord. We should sacrifice the fruits of our actions. Only in renunciation of the fruits there is our salvation. He, who has realized this truth, attains the Supreme Being, free from sins. The fruits of the actions should be renunciated inwardly. Suppose any one of us is burdened with the debt of one lakh of rupees and he has to pay it to many money-lenders. He has the capital of only twenty five thousand rupees, then he hands over his entire capital to the government or the money-lenders and he declares that ‘I surrender this capital whatever I have with me, please, adjust your loans with this capital. This is the law that if anyone declares himself bankrupt and he honestly deposits the capital whatever is in his possession to the government account and then the government sets him free from the loans of one lakh of rupees even with his twenty five thousand rupees. The government gives the decision that he has become bankrupt, so those who have claim, will get fourth part of their claim. </p>
<p class="Text">But in the court of the Lord there is another law regarding this. His law is to surrender his entire capital whatever he has, to the court of the Lord. He does not declare His dear devotee as bankrupt. He fulfills the demand of the claimants completing the shortage of His devotee’s amount from his own capital and thus, fulfilling the demand of the money-lenders He will bid them farewell and He will set him free from his debt. </p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is repeating it again and again offer your entire to Me, then it will be My responsibility to free you of the bonds of the fruits of your virtuous and sinful actions.’ The virtuous actions are the fetters of gold and the vile actions of sin are the fetters of iron. It means that the doer of the pious deeds goes to the heaven and the committer of sin goes to hell. The man who makes the sacrifice of heaven with this sentiment that ‘I offer my all the virtuous actions to the Lord’ then the Lord says, ‘When he offered his all the virtuous actions to the Lord’ as result of which if I (the Lord) give him only what is the fruit of his actions, then what he got by offering it to Me it can be got anywhere else, The Lord asks him who  surrenders to the Lord—‘How much is the debt on you?’ He says ‘My Lord! I am in debt of one lakh of rupees and at present I have the capital of only twenty five thousands of rupees.’ Then, the Lord says ‘go and make merry.’ It means to say that the Lord frees him of all the loans, so because there is no scarcity of anything in the treasury of the Lord. When seeking shelter to the Lord, he begs him to pay off his loans, the Lord pays it off and frees him completely from the debts. Such is the Lord’s sentiment. The Lord is so kind-hearted that only by seeking shelter to him the ocean of mundane is crossed. This is the easiest way to cross the ocean of this mortal world. </p>
<p class="Text">If anyone is desirous of his deliverance even today, he should offer his entire, to the Lord and be carefree having offered. Then, he may try to liberate the whole world. Our duty is not only self-redemption we should emancipate all beings. All are suffering from grief <span class="char-style-override-4">‘त्राहि माम्, त्राहि माम्’</span> ‘crying for protection, emancipate all. The question arises how will the deliverance of all be possible? The answer is—as will be self-deliverance so will be the deliverance of all ones. We attain deliverance by performing actions for God’s sake thus, all will be emancipated. We should do our best to set such example as may inspire others to do actions for God’s sake, so that all may attain deliverance. If we shape our conduct accordingly, our speech will have impact on others. They will also start doing accordingly and there will be the highest good of all. The man who is of such sacrificing nature, leaves his impression on others. There should be such sentiment in the heart as all may become God-devotee. All mey be liberated. All may be attained to the Lord. What goes from our pocket? This is a very high sentiment. Here is no expenditure at all. The result is so fruitful that he accomplishes the highest good and by his endeavour the others are also emancipated. In the same way, our effort should always be for the sake of the Lord.’ The supreme Lord is present in all the beings and the service of all beings is the service of the Lord.’ If our service comes in practice with this sentiment our joy will have no bound. If the Lord appears here in the manifested form and the opportunity to serve him may be available, then what will be the limit of our joy, it cannot be imagined, it will be beyond limit if we remain serving the Lord the whole day then what is the limit of our joy, such opportunity is available by very good luck. Such opportunity was available to Lakshmanji for fourteen years by good fortune.</p>
<p class="Text">Lakshmanji goes to his mother and says to her, ‘Mother! The Lord Rama is departing for the wood and the mother Sita is also going along with him. It is my heartiest desire also to accompany Him for their service.’ In the reply the Mother says—‘While Rama along with Sita is departing for the wood then, what is your work here? Son! This is only my sermon and command to you that you should serve Rama considering Him as your father and serve Sita considering Her as your mother.’ Oh! What a marvellous sermon the mother is giving! Not only this, she says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तुम्हरेहिं भाग रामु बन जाहीं। </p>
<p class="Shlok">दूसर हेतु तात कछु नाहीं॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Shri Ramacharitamanasa</span> 2/75/3)</p>
<p class="Text">“It is due to your good fortune that Rama is proceeding to the forest there is no other reason for doing so, my boy.”</p>
<p class="Text">What a good luck you have got? You have got an opportunity to serve Rama. Some are of the opinion that it is Manthara; the sole cause behind Rama’s exile. Kaikeyi is also a reason but they are mere instrumental. The reality is that it was a turn of good luck in your favour.’ Here there were many to serve and you were deprived of much more service and there you have the great opportunity of the service of the Lord Rama and mother Sita. Such an opportunity is almost unobtainable as the feeling of the service of the Lord Rama and mother Sita came to your mind, I also feel myself highly fortunate. I also feel proud of my mother hood—</p>

<p class="Text">‘That woman alone can be said to have borne a male issue, whose son is a devotee of Rama otherwise she had better remain issueless for she who deems herself fortrunate in having a son who is not a devotee of Rama has yeaned in vain. She borne a child like cows and buffalos. A barren woman is superior to her. How the mother Sumitra bids her son farewell with her blessing! She says—‘Son! This is my bidding as well as sermon that reaching the forest offer your services devotedly to the Lord Rama and mother Sita.’</p>
<p class="Text">If we assume all as the manifestation of God then, our service to all the beings will be the service of the Lord. By such service if we get peace, joy and happiness, it is quite right. If we don’t find peace joy and happiness in the service of other, it means that we do not assume them as God. Till now we assume that he is a man, that is animal, this is a bird etc., but if we all are endowed with feeling in our mind that the Lord is Himself in all the beings and if we serve anyone means we serve the Lord, then our sentiment will be changed and we will see the Lord in everyone. The Lord has visited our house as a guest and we are serving him meal. Suppose, you are going on your way and a cow happens to come before you then you should think that the Lord is standing in the form of a cow; if you see any tree, think that the Lord has assumed His form as tree.’ Thus in every object when we will see the Lord, we will always get supernatural joy and happiness in our heart and mind. Our sentiment will be changed, our life will be changed.</p>
<p class="Text">By the change of our sentiment, our all actions get changed. This is a personal experience; I have seen it with my own eyes. It relates to past days that there was a gentlemen named Mukund Pandey. A few years back I used to live in Kanpur Kothi in Swargashrama, which is situated adjoining the ‘Rani ki Kothi’. I used to stay there for many years. He had come to meet me. He was a very loving and sentimental person. We had never met before. This was our first meeting. We had come in contact with each other through letters. One day, I was just proceeding towards the ‘Banyan tree’ for the purpose of giving discourse. Coming out of the building at about 8’O clock. Pandeyji was coming in front of me. There was a servant with him who had a bundle of bedding and he also had some articles or objects in his hand. I presumed that the man was going towards the Kothi, probably he might be any lover of religious congregation and coming to visit me. I asked him—‘Where are you coming from, what is your introduction, where are you going to?’ Instead of answering lovingly he answered me indifferently—‘I am going to Jayadayalji’ It was not known to him that it was I, who was Jayadayal by name, he began to proceed ahead. There were many others also with me. They indicated him that it is he whose name is jaydayal. I myself, asking him and without seeing towards me he is proceeding towards the Kothi. When the others hinted him that it is he to whom you are going to meet, he threw away what he had in his hand and stretched himself flat. He said—‘I could not recognize that you yourself are Jayadayalji. It was you to whom I was going.’ So long as he did not recognize me, he was going ignoring me like other common people and when he came to know me that he was going to meet me his feelings changed.’ Similarly we treat all others as animal, bird, man as they appear outwardly, this is our feeling. Our mentality is changed. When we would begin to think that the Supreme Being whom we have to attain is present in all the beings the very moment our feelings will be changed. I related this event so because his mind and thought changed in a moment. Tears began to flow from his eyes. </p>
<p class="Text">This is to be understood well that this is our sentiment and inner feeling which is the main. Till now the feelings what we have in our mind is that he is a man, that is animal and that is bird, tree and cow and if our mind is changed about them Ah! This is the Supreme Lord had manifested Himself in different forms of all the beings; our attitude will be changed in a moment. Then our peace and joy will have no bound. This is what I and others have personally withnessed.</p>
<p class="Text">Think of changing your sentiment that the Lord, whom we are craving for, is present in all the beings apparently. This is the defect of our eye-sight that we are seeing this world coloured in different colours. It we put on the spectacles of green colour on our eyes, the whole world will look to us green, but in reality  the world is not of the green colour that is of different colours. It looks green because of the spectacles of green colour. Exactly like the same our heart is convinced with the artificial spectacles of the world and we are to be free from that false spectacles. When we put off that spectacles the real form of the Lord will be visible to us. It will look as it is if we put the spectacles of the Lord’s colour on our heart, the whole world will start looking in the Lords colour. This spectacles of the Lord’s colour is the true spectacles. In fact, the Lord is present in all beings. The Gita states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते। </p>
<p class="Shlok">वासुदेवः सर्वमिति स महात्मा सदुर्लभः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 7/19)</p>
<p class="Text">‘In the very last of all births the enlightened person worships me, realizing that all this is God. Such a great soul is very rare, indeed.’</p>
<p class="Text">After suffering eighty lakhs of species in several births, we have got this human body as the last birth aftermanifold births. The other meaning is that we have practising spiritual discipline from many births but we could not develop in any one the sentiment of God. Now the Lord states that while engaged in spiritual discipline who worships Me as God in all beings and he realizes that all is God and He is rare great soul amongst all great souls. In very last of all the births this human birth has been attained. So after this last birth there should be no birth again. This human birth is the means to end all future births because it is the human birth only in which the man can accomplish his ultimate goal.</p>
<p class="Text">Fortunately, all of us are present in the human body. For us this human body is the last of all the births and this birth is capable to end all the successive births of future. It is the end when there is the realization that all is God. We would not spend any penny nor a single paisa, how to appreciate this sentiment! Such a great soul is very rare to realize this <span class="char-style-override-4">‘स महात्मा सुदुर्लभ:’</span> Neither time, nor labour, is heeded Only sentiment is to be inculcated then we are obstinate that we would not inculcate such sentiment. What is the objection to accept to what is true? These are the words of the Lord the Lord’s words can never be false. The Lord, Himself states—‘Whatever is visible that is all it is ‘I’, it should be admitted—it should be accepted that what the Lord states, that is right. ‘All this is God’—he who worships in this way he who admits it whole heartedly is a great soul and he who doesn’t worship, likewise is the worldly being, why should me be in the category of worldly beings? Why should we not be counted in the category of great souls? The Lord states—‘Whatever is there in this world is my form.’ By accepting this truth the life of the man who has accepted it, is changed completely. You may test it by accepting it, making sure this in your mind you may test it. Here, nothing is required for you to do, you have to change only your sentiments, your feelings and your mind and with the change of thoughts whatever the evils are in your mind burn to ashes and it takes only a moment to attain the lord. We have to do nothing.</p>
<p class="Text">The <span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> is full of such most valuable sermons by accepting even one of them we attain salvation. Nothing is required to do to repeat the Lord’s Name, to meditate or to worship to make obeisance, to dedicate in devotion—nothing of all these. If only we accept the words of the Lord, we admit them as the truth, our aim is accomplished. The Lord states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 5/29)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Having known me in reality the disinterested friend of all brings, My devotee attains peace.’</p>
<p class="Text">What goes from your pocket to believe such words of the Lord that the Lord is the disinterested friend of all beings. If the Lord, Himself is not the selfless friend then, who is that such true friend who loves without any cause, who is graceful without any motive? If anyone does not accept it, it means he is a great fool; he is a carper, he is ungrateful, because the Lord blessed us with this human body without cause. The Lord is a great lover without any cause and motive, a selfless friend of us. We were distressed going round through eighty four lakh species of life, showing pity on us the Lord blessed us with human body, what a great mercy of the Lord is on us! Even then, if we don’t accept him as our selfless friend, we are ungrateful at all. Tulasidasji states—</p>
<p class="Shlok">आकर चारि लाख चौरासी। </p>
<p class="Shlok">जोनि भ्रमत यह जिव अबिनासी॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">फिरत सदा माया कर प्रेरा। </p>
<p class="Shlok">काल कर्म सुभाव गुन घेरा॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘This immortal soul going round through eighty four lakh species of life, falling under four broad divisions, driven by Maya (My deluding potency) and encompassed by Time, destiny, Nature and phenomenal existence.’</p>
<p class="Text">‘Akar’ means classes of birth. There are four broad divisions of the beings—Swedaja, Andaja, Udbhija and Jarayuja. Born of sweat are Swedaja and born of eggs or Andaja as birds, ants etc. Born of earth are Udbhija as tree, termite etc. Born of placenta are human beings and animals etc. The embodied being is encompassed by Time, Destiny, Nature and modes of Nature. Driven by Maya going round through eighty-four lakhs of species of life by divine grace it is blessed with a human body. The Lord has stated in Gita—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ईश्वरः सर्वभूतानां हृद्देशेऽर्जुन तिष्ठति। </p>
<p class="Shlok">भ्रामयन्सर्वभूतानि यन्त्रारूढानि मायया॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 18/61)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Arjuna, God abides in the heart of all beings, causing them to revolve, according to their Karma by His illusive power ‘Maya’, as though mounted an a machine (the body).’ To get deliverance from this successive births the Lord has stated in the Gita—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तमेव शरणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत। </p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्प्रसादात्परां शान्तिं स्थानं प्राप्स्यसि शाश्वतम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 18/62)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Take refuge in him in alone with all your being, Arjuna. By His mere grace you shall attain supreme peace and the eternal state.’</p>
<p class="Text">But in (<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 5/29) He states—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति’</span> having known. Me in reality the disinterested friend of all beings, My devotee attains peace.’ To accept these Lord’s words—<span class="char-style-override-4">‘सुहृदं सर्वभूतानाम्’</span> the disinterested friend of all beings nothing extra labour is required, not to adore God, not to think of the Lord in meditation, not to perform actions with selfless motive. The Lord bestows his grace and love on us without cause. This is evident. We should practise it in our practical life.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord bestows His grace on the soul revolving in the eighty-four lakh species and blessed it with human body—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कबहुँक करि करुना नर देही। </p>
<p class="Shlok">देत ईस बिनु हेतु सनेही॥</p>

<p class="Text">‘Rarely does God, who loves the Jiva without any self interest, graciously bestow on it a human form.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord is an unique lover of all beings—His compassion begins to shower without any cause. The Lord is the most affectionate to all—He is a lover without any interest. He is a lover without motive. He is kind-hearted. He who loves Him without any self-interest, who is compassionate, is called a disinterested friend. The Lord is full of compassion and pity. The Lord is friendly to all beings who being melted with pity bestows on soul a human form. We were distressed while revolving in eighty-four lakh of species, so the Lord bestowed on us the human body graciously with love. If the Lord had made us animal instead of human being, or had made us birds, who squeak only, we would have also squeaked like the birds. Are the animals and birds in a position to find out any way so that may also become human being and may be included among them? Actually, we should regard God compassionate and kind-hearted without any self-interest. The animals and birds may not realize him so but we are the human beings. The Lord has bestowed on us his special grace and blessed us with a human body. This human body is difficult even for Gods to attain—</p>

<p class="Text">‘It is by good fortune that you have secured a human body, which as declared by all scriptures, that it is difficult even for the Gods to attain.’ Having got fortunately that human body, if we are not devoted to God, if we don’t sing the devotional song in the Lord’s praise, if we don’t meditate the Lord and not serve Him. At least, we should not be completely wretched. Because, we should at least consider the Lord as selfless friend who always does our good. We should think how kind-hearted Lord is who has bestowed his grace on us, who has provided us opportunity. The Lord made us available the holy country. the pious time, the high. Caste, the best religion and noble company also.</p>
<p class="Text">This Swargashrama is the central land of uttarakhand, it is famous by the name of ‘Mayapuri’ This Mayapuri is spread from Kanakhal to Lakshmanajhula. It is stated that he who dies here and who attends religious congregation here, attain salvation. This bank of the Ganga is Uttarakhand. This is ‘Mayapuri’ as well as the bank of Ganga too. What can be any other superior land than this? The land is superior and the time is also superior. Because the ‘Kali age’  has been described as the best one. It has been stated in <span class="char-style-override-5">Vishnupurana</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत् कृते दशभिर्वर्षैस्त्रेतायां हायनेन तत्। </p>

<p class="Text">‘The ultimate goal what is accomplished by the practice of spiritual exercise for ten years in ‘Satyayuga’, one year in ‘Treta’ and one month in ‘Dwapara’, is achieved in a single day, in ‘Kaliyuga’, How easy it is!</p>
<p class="Text">The age of Kali is the mine of vices, but there a special quality in this age that by the worship and devotion of the Lord the salvalion is attained very soon. We have got the oppornunity of Kaliyuga. Now, it is our duty to dedicate overselves to God’s devotion. Tulasidasji says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कलिजुग सम जुग आन नहिं जौं नर कर बिस्वास। </p>

<p class="Text">‘No other age can compare with the Kali age provided a man has faith (in its virtue) for, in this age one can easily cross the ocean of transmigration simply by singing Shri Rama’a holy praises.’ </p>
<p class="Text">So, we are fortunate to get the most suitable age also. We were born in the human class of birth and especially in India which has been considered the holiest on the earth.</p>

<p class="Text">‘Manuji states that the men of the whole earth used to learn the spiritual teachings from India. We are born on the pious land of that India. The highest ‘Dharma’ is so because there are Koles and Kirats (of lower castes) also in India. And in India there are a number of them who are the followers of other religion. ‘Vedic Sanatan’ is the ‘Dharma’ here ‘Sanatan Dharma’ means the ‘Dharma’ that continues from time immemorial. That which remains forever, so this is called ‘Sanatan (Eternal)’. The Dharma, which remains in existence forever, is called our Vaidik Dharma is since ever and will remains forever in which we are born. All Dharmas as are prevalent in the world today are of modern age,  none is eternal, the prime book of Islamic religion is ‘Quran Sarif’ as approved by Islam and its prophet is ‘Hazarat Mohammad,’ just think over seriously how long passed of his origin, it is only fourteen thousand and four hundred years. Before fourteen thousand and sixty-hundred years there was neither Quran sarif nor ‘Hazarat Mohammad’ in the world. The religion of ‘Isha’ (Christ) which we call Christian, that originated only one thousand and nine hundred fifty-five years ago. Before this period there was neither Christ nor Christianity in the world. So, there was nothing like such in the ancient past. They are now crores in number, today the Muslims also are crores in number, but before 200 years, there was not their name even. ‘Gautama Buddha’ was born. The ‘Baudh Dharma’, is after his name. Before 3000 year ago he was also nowhere. The followers of Budhism are also in crores in number.’</p>
<p class="Text">This our ‘Sanatan Dharma’ is since ever. This ‘Sanatan Dharma’ has been continuing since the origin of the world. We were born in such a religion, this is also the Lord’ grace. In such atmosphere and condition we assembled here at such a holy place of pilgrimage to attain the Lord. This is also the Lord’s grace.</p>
<p class="Text">Equipped with all such privileges; still if we fail to attain God then it is a matter of great shame for us. Tulasidasji says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जो न तरै भव सागर नर समाज अस पाइ। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सो कृत निंदक मंदमति आत्माहन गति जाइ॥</p>

<p class="Text">‘The man who, though equipped with all these resources, fails to cross the ocean of metempsychosis is ungrateful and dull-witted and meets the fate of a suicider.’</p>
<p class="Text">Keeping all these points in mind we should accomplish that purpose soon for which this human body is blessed to us. There is no certainty even of a single moment that when the death may attack suddenly and kill us. There is no such guarantee written on copper-plate against the death, there is no such power with us even that on the arrival of the Yama messengers we may postpone for the next day and say I have no time today. They will forcibly bind us and take away.</p>
<p class="Text">If there is any warrant of arrest issued by the court there is a possibility of release by giving bribe or any other way but when there is the warrant of the Yama of death, there is no excuse there is no possibility at all to escape. When will the death come, is not known, it will come abruptly. We will come to know on its arrival. So, we should remain prepared having completed our work before hand, because so long as the death is away from us, and the old age is far away to come, you are physically fit, complete your work beforehand for which you have come in this world in the form of mankind.</p>
<p class="Text">We revolved in the eighty four lakh species. No class of birth was left, no world was left. We wandered about in all the worlds but the Supreme Lord could not be attained. If  we had attained the Lord, there would have been no need to revolve. This human class of birth, this human body has been gifted to us only to attain that goal, which could not be attained by us till now. So it should be our motive to attain it. What will be the use of wife, sons, riches for us, what will be the use of this body? What will this family be useful for us? What will be the use of prosperity and house? The Lord has enriched us of all these to help other beings.</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord states that—‘Do your best to attain Me by doing good to other beings.’ All these object what we have got, are to attain the Lord. If we misuse it, then our condition will be miserable doubtlessly. The Lord was very gracious to us that He bestowed on us this human body, He provided us opportunity. At least we should realize such a kind-hearted as kind-hearted. By thinking Him kind hearted our purpose is served, but we don’t accept Him as kind-hearted even. We became so ungrateful, that is why we came to this miserable condition. So attention should be given seriously to the Lord’s mercy. What a great graceful is the Lord, His grace is boundless. It is the Lord’s grace that enbles us to attain the Lord. We have to become only the instrument for the practice of spiritual discipline. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The Lord states to Arjuna—this entire army has already been slain by Me, you, be only an instrument. Well, be ready to fight this war. It will be propagated only that it is Arjuna who has slain. What is harm to you to be an instrument Suppose, you don’t become the instrument but brother, I am sure to do this work at all. They have to die and they will die ultimately. I will use someone else as an instrument. The Lord thus bestows the glory on Arjuna. In the same way, it is the Lord’s grace only to our work. That grace of the Lord uses us only as instrument. By virtue of the spiritual discipline only God would be attained; but we have to become the instrument for that spiritual exercise. This practice will be started automatically by the Lord’s Grace. It should be accepted by us. The Lord states that they are alive only seemingly but actually, they are dead. You kill these dead ones. Similarly, we should know the Lord’s supreme grace and all the works are to be done by His grace. If we prove ourselves only instrumental, we will take the benefit of His grace. He who has the faith in the Lord’s grace will take its benefit. The Lord is bent upon doing the highest good of the people, who becomes His instrument will be in gain and who does’t become instrument will remain deprived of.<span></span></p>

<p class="Text">Several methods of God-realization have been stated in the scriptures but even among them there is one which in very easy in practice and during the period of practice as well as end on the accomplishment of the goal, there is joy and joy only. In the practice period of the other kinds of such disciplines there at first is hardship  and in the end there is joy but in the practice of this spiritual discipline there is joy in the both stages. There would be joy and cheerfulness every moment. In other spiritual disciplines there is some hardships but in this discipline there is no hardship at all. There are many who may not probably practise spiritual discipline which is a bit hard but there should be no denial in making this practice of that spiritual exercise which involves no hardship at all; because here, there is the experience of joy and peace both. In this discipline there is one thing also particular that none feels sated and he is never fed up in this practice. A man does make effort for the worldly enjoyments, but after the enjoyment by the body and sense-organs he become fully sated and he feels fed up. As after taking the food to the full of stomach the desire to eat even the delicious food remains no more. The same is the case about the enjoyment of the other worldly object, because all these are the common joys. But the joy what we get in the practice of this discipline that is supernatural joy and instead of waning, it goes on waxing progressively in this discipline. In such a situation if anyone refuses to engage in the discipline then what is the remedy? </p>
<p class="Text">This practice is very easy, according to the ordain of the scriptures and also very logical. In this exercise of spiritual practice we should remain always cheerful and ecstatic. This is the Lord’s great grace on us; our redemption is sure, do not have the least doubt. Remember the Lord always in your mind and remain always cheerful. Get yourself enraptured in remembrance. The joy and happiness is the form of the Lord. Remember any form of the Lord because all are the forms of the same Lord. Either remembers your own deity or any other form of the God as—Narayan, Ramachandra, Shiv, Krishna and formless Absolute-Truth etc. If anyone says that exactly true pleasure is not felt in remembering the Lord, if he does not relish joy let it be so but the scriptures describe him the solidified Bliss only. So, it is proved that in rememberance of the Lord there is Bliss and Bliss only. There is only the joy and joy and nothing except this. </p>
<p class="Text">Not to feel bliss is mere your assumption. If the seeker only develops his faith that There is ever joy in remembering the God, he is sure to realize it later on there is no doubt about it. There lies our salvation in faith only. God is the ocean of mercy and compassion. ‘The Lord’s memory is the source of joy,’ it would make us overjoyed if this sentiment is accepted in our mind, as the God is the embodiment of mercy. There is room for all the good things in his kind-heartedness. This spiritual practice will do our redemption doubtlessly, because the Lord’s grace is boundless. There is no limit to it.</p>
<p class="Text">Think of the Lord with his form, and His episodes relating to His attributes, glory, mystery and truth and remain charmed by these. Remain over whelmed only by his charm to see his appearance and form. The Lord is the ocean of bliss. Keep yourself always drawned in the joy and happiness. Don’t come out of it, remain sinking in his form, because Lord is the next form of joy. If you remain always sinking in this bliss only, doubtlessly, you will attain joy. If your mind does not feel so, don’t care for it. Remain drowned in the ocean of joy only. If you cannot do so, remain thinking that there is only joy and joy in this practice of spiritual exercise and its result, there is nothing except joy. Not only this much, there is no place to any other thing except joy.</p>
<p class="Text">It is great grace of the Lord. If the Lord had not granted our birth in the human womb, then what could we have done? What was our force on Him? What could we do if he had made us trees grown on the mountains? But this is the boundless grace of the Lord on us that He bestowed upon us the human life, then why should we not be charmed in the Lord’s memory? We were born in Aryavart, which is the land of spiritualism. The land of other countries is the land of worldly enjoyments. This is only the land of spiritualism where we were born. What an appreciable matter it is! What could we do if we were born on the land of any other country, and on the other hand besides this, this bank of Gangaji and this opportunity for talks about the Lord on its sands when such things are available here jointly together even then can there be any possibility of doubt in our highest welfare? Our highest good is positive,’ what is the objection in accepting it? Our highest good is certain,” but it is difficult if anyone utters thus, then consider over it seriously where is that difficulty? The Lord is the ocean of mercy. Will it have any diminution for the water of the sea as how many pots are filled with water and taken out? It is never possible. The man who has firm faith in his mind that ‘his salvation is inevitable’, is beyond doubt in attaining his ultimate good, his such good is certain without the least doubt. But when he is in a fix whether his highest good is possible or not, take it his redemption definitely doubtful. </p>
<p class="Text">The lord is graceful to all beings without any self-interest. Even then, we should pray to the Lord—‘O God! I am worthless at all by all the means. Make me Your instrument for whatever you want to get done. What is there in me to do anything and whatever is possible by me, that is merely the result of your grace.’</p>
<p class="Text">The man who wants to please anyone, praises him, extols his virtuous merits highly. Our purpose is  not to please anyone, we have to praise the Lord only. So, it is the Lord only whom we should pray and sing in His Praise. While hymning to the Lord we should not care whether we have love or not, but the prayer and chanting in His praise must be made. Have faith and confidence in the Lord that despite the lack of love by me, the God is bound to love me and Lord will love also doubtlessly. If anyone says that he has confidence on any other one—suppose on me, then if anyone has confidence in me, I will surely give him what he wants when it will be my utmost effort that he may not lose his confidence in me and having this consideration in my mind I will fulfill his demand. If it is found so among the men then if you pray to the Lord even though you have no love, will the God not be bound to love you? He must be compelled to love, there is no doubt about it. Why only this much, the God will have to support you by all the means and He will support because who is another one to support you except Him? It is not only so much, He will make you feel by giving you more love than your expectation. His love to you will be so intense that cannot check Himself but to meet you. The Lord is such compassionate. Now the question is if the God is so kind-hearted and affectionate then why doesn’t He meet us soon? Be confident that whatever delay is being made in the meeting with the Lord that is for the sake of your good only. There is no doubt about it. In the delay of your meeting with God your restlessness goes on increasing. It is beyond the man’s capacity to guess the Lord’s mercy in reality. What mercy of the Lord comes to his mind, His mercy in reality is manifold than his expectation. Not only this, man cannot even presume how much is. His kind-heartedness. You cannot get the joy in worldly objects of enjoyment so mach as much in the experience of His grace.</p>
<p class="Text">If you do not feel any cheerfulness in your inner-sense,  let it be not so, you only make a sincere imagination that your mind is full of delight then that your resolve will prove true—</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम्। </p>
<p class="Shlok">उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/27)</p>
<p class="Text">‘For to the Yogi whose mind is perfectly serene, who is sinless, whose passion is subdued, and who is identified with Brahma, the embodiment of truth. Knowledge and Bliss, Supreme happiness comes as a matter of course.’ And—</p>
<p class="Shlok">युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी विगतकल्मषः। </p>
<p class="Shlok">सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तं सुखमश्नुते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(<span class="char-style-override-5">Gita</span> 6/28)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The sinless Yogi, thus uniting his Self constantly with God, easily enjoys the eternal bliss of oneness with Brahma.’ </p>
<p class="Text">There is no room for doubt in the enjoyment of joy in the period of the spiritual practice and Supreme happiness in the consequence. These are the apparent words of Lord Krishna. The Lord’s words can never be untrue. Make the spiritual practice in the practical life and put its truth on test. When you would relish this joy, no idea of other practice will come to your mind. You should remain so much charmed in rapture that your mind may be free from any worry. What is the need of worry after seeking Sheller to the Lord? After seeking shelter to the Lord the worry cannot come near you at all. In ecstasy man forgets even the care of his life and death. He remains always overwhelmed with joy. At that time he has neither concern to life nor death. He doesn’t at all have any desire of life and death. There is negation of the worldly desires of any kind. When the man reaches this state of happiness, the Lord, Himself, looks after him. What is there base for this? The base is the Lord’s love and His grace. What is more reliable support than this? Whose support is there for a child? It is his mother only for his support. If the child weeps for milk, and the mother at once suckles him milk. Sometimes It may be delayed from the mother’s side, but can the Lord make such delay? And if there is any delay from the God’s side it should be understood that there is our good in the delay.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-5">The Lord is omniscient. He only knows where is our true welfare, so having firm reliance on Him be free from worry at all. As a dumb is overjoyed to eat the sugar candy, similarly to think of the Lord’s grace we should be absorbed in it and nothing other should be brought in our thought. Be happy in what the God wills even if the Lord pushes you into the pit, you should have no objection against His decision. Remain happy with His decision. Make publicity of that spiritual discipline of joy to the best of your capacity with full force so that as its result all the others may continue remaining charmed with that joy. The devotee practising spiritual exercises should be so overwhelmed with charm that if anyone even makes him seated in the fire at that time he may not even feel the heat of fire. The question may arise that in such a condition there is the possibility of the modification in mind, but there is no reason at all of such modification to be created. If any modification is created there will be only foolishness as its reason. So everyone should continue this practice always according to his capacity and remain being charmed realizing the Lord’s grace. As much time he gives in this discipline so much joy he will feel and as a result he will attain the Supreme bliss, there is no doubt about it.<span></span></p>
