(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 1, p. 436.)

\[*Detroit Evening News*, March 21, 1894\]

Curiosity, says our Hindoo visitor, is the most conspicuous trait of the
American people, but he added that it is the way to knowledge. This has

Yankee character, and perhaps the Hindoo's comment was an echo of what
he had heard the Englishmen in India say of the "Yankee."
