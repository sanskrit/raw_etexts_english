title = "A brief note on animal heads, Celtic human sacrifice, and Indo-Europeanxa0tradition"

+++
Our illustrious ancestor Dadhyaṅc Ātharvaṇa is supposed to have
possessed privileged knowledge from the great Indra that even the twin
gods, the Aśvin-s, sought to get it from him. However, speaking out this
secret knowledge would have cost him his head as that was the condition
under which Indra had imparted it to him. Hence, they surgically fitted
him with a horse’s head so that he could convey it to him. The great Ṛṣi
Kakṣīvān, the son of Dīrghatamas, the founder of the Gotama clan,
alluded to this act of the Aśvin-s in a mantra in the Ṛgveda thus:

tad vāṃ narā sanaye daṃsa ugram  
āviṣ kṛṇomi tanyatur na vṛṣṭim |  
dadhyaṅ ha yan madhv ātharvaṇo vām  
aśvasya śīrṣṇā pra yad īm uvāca || RV 1.116.12

O manly twins, that awful wonder-act of yours \[done\] for gain,  
I make widely known, as thunder \[announces\] rain,  
indeed Dadhyaṅc Ātharvaṇa spoke to you two  
that which is “honey” through the head of a horse.

In Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa 14.1.1.25 it is stated that the privileged
knowledge possessed by Dadhyaṅc Ātharvaṇa concerns the Pravargya ritual
by which the Soma-yāga is made “whole”. The Pravargya ritual again
refers to a severed head, that of Makha, Viṣṇu, or Rudra in different
brāhmaṇa-s, which is represented by the central implement of the
ritual, the Gharma pot. The Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa 14.1.4.13 further
elaborates this Madhu-vidyā and it is presented as the high teaching of
the upaniṣat in 14.5.5 (i.e. the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣat).

This mythic nucleus serves as a locus for further elaboration in later
Hindu tradition. The Purāṇa-s incorporate the frame of the Pravargya
myth into a narrative to explain how the horse-headed Viṣṇu came into
being. His head is described as being severed, even as it was in one
of the Pravargya legend, and was then replaced with that of horse. This
horse-headed Viṣṇu is then able to slay a horse-headed asura, who had
invulnerability from everyone else, except another with a horse’s head.

Interestingly, Russian archaeologists claimed that such a chimeric form,
a man with a horse’s head, was found in a kurgan of the Potapovka
culture \[A sister of the more famous Sintashta culture\] near the
Samara Bend on the Volga steppes – a place close the original homeland
of the Aryans. However, subsequent dating showed that the human and
horse skeletons belong to different ages and the superimposition of two
separate burials human and horse at the same site separated by several
hundreds of years had accidentally created the impression of a chimera.

Archaeological chimeras have nevertheless re-emerged recently. An Iron
Age site from Dorset, UK has provided extensive evidence for chimeric
creations by Britonic Celts. These include chimeras between horses and
cows as well as burial of multiple heads of sacrificed animals. It is
uncertain if these were purely Celtic innovations or have earlier
Indo-European precedents. The human sacrifice at the site seems to have
placed the human remains on various animals remains with a
correspondence of the parts.

This is reminiscent of aspects of the funerary custom of our ancient
Ātharvaṇa ancestors (Kauśika-sūtra 80-89): cremation of the human along
with a sacrificed animal. An animal, typically a cow, is sacrificed and
its parts are cut up carefully and placed on the corresponding parts of
the Ātharvaṇa’s body along with all the ritual implements he had used
while alive, smeared with goat butter. His right hand is made to hold a
staff. The text specifies that in the case of a kṣatriya his bow is
placed instead. Thereafter, it being a cremation, the equivalence
diverges. The pyre is then lit using the fires in which he had made
offerings during his life and an invocation of Yama is made, followed by
the mantra honoring the ancient Aṅgiras-es and Bhṛgu-s. Once he has
burned his remains are collected sprinkled with milk and collected in an
urn mixed with scented powders and unguents. Then the urn with the
remains or just the remains are buried and a śmaśāna is piled over it. A
version of a similar cremation is narrated in the Greek epic by
Agamemnon’s ghost to Achilles about his own funeral:

*The daughters of the “Old Man of the Sea” stood around your
\[Achilles\] corpse lamenting bitterly. They wrapped your body in an
imperishable shroud. And the nine Muses chanted your dirge, responding
each to each in their sweet voices. There was not a single Argive to be
seen without tears in his eyes, so moving was the clear song of the
Muse. Immortal gods and mortal men, we mourned for you, seventeen days
and nights, and on the eighteenth we delivered you to the flames,
sacrificing herds of fattened sheep and spiral-horned cattle round you.
You were burnt clothed as a god, drowned in unguents and sweet honey,
and a host of Achaean heroes streamed past your pyre as you burned,
warriors and charioteers, making a vast noise. And at dawn, Achilles,
when Hephaestus’ fires had eaten you, we gathered up your whitened ash
and bone, and steeped them in oil and unmixed wine. Your mother gave us
a gold two-handled urn, saying it was the gift of Dionysus, and crafted
by far-famed Hephaestus himself. There your ashes lie, my glorious
Achilles, mixed with the bones of the dead Patroclus, Menoetius’ son,
but separated from those of Antilochus, who next to dead Patroclus you
loved most among your comrades. And on a headland thrusting into the
wide Hellespont we, the great host of Argive spearmen, heaped a vast
flawless mound above them, so it might be seen far out to sea by men who
live now and those to come.*

The Greek account is notable in several ways: The parallels to the
Atharvan version (and more generally the Vaidika version) is apparent.
The use of sweet honey is interesting for the Atharvanic injunction for
a kṣatriya’s corpse is: “madhūtsiktena kṣatriyasyāvasiñcati” (A stream
of honey is poured over the kṣatriya’s); thus, Achilles was being given
a kṣatriya’s funeral. Eating of Achilles by the fires of Hephaestus may
be compared with the phrase of the corpse-eating Agni Kravyāda in the
Veda. The Kurgan custom of the steppes is also retained by the Greeks
who pile a Kurgan for Achilles, even as described in the Atharvan and
Ṛgvedic Kurgan burial.

Irrespective of whether the chimeras and sacrificed animal heads at the
Celtic site had any earlier Indo-European connection, we find references
to both such animal heads and the chimeras in the Vedic ritual.

In the soma ritual at the base of the altar heads of five animals,
including humans, are laid as a foundation. This is described thus in
the brāhmaṇa section of the Taittirīya-saṃhitā thus:

prajāpatir agnim asṛjata |  
Prajāpati emitted Agni.

so ‘smāt sṛṣṭaḥ prāṅ prādaravat tasmā aśvam praty āsyat |  
He (Agni) \[when\] emitted ran away east from him (Prajāpati); he
(Prajāpati) hurled a horse at him (Agni).

sa dakṣiṇāvartata tasmai vṛṣṇim praty āsyat |  
He (Agni) turned to the south; he (Prajāpati) hurled a ram at him
(Agni).

sa pratyaṅṅ āvartata tasmā ṛṣabham praty āsyat |  
He (Agni) turned to the west; he (Prajāpati) hurled a bull at him
(Agni).

sa udaṅṅ āvartata tasmai bastam praty āsyat |  
He (Agni) turned to the north; he (Prajāpati) hurled a goat at him
(Agni).

sa ūrdhvo ‘dravat tasmai puruṣam praty āsyat |  
He (Agni) fled upwards; he (Prajāpati) hurled a man at him (Agni).

yat paśu-śīrṣāṇy upadadhāti sarvata evainam avarudhya cinute |  
Thus, he (the ritual specialist: adhvaryu) places the animal-heads,
enclosing them all around, he piles \[the altar\].

etā vai prāṇa-bhṛtaś cakṣuṣmatīr iṣṭakā yat paśu-śīrṣāṇi |  
These, the animal-heads, truly life-supporting \[and\] possessed of
sight are the bricks (i.e. of the ritual’s foundation).

yat paśu-śīrṣāṇy upadadhāti tābhir eva yajamāno ‘muṣmin loke prāṇity
atho tābhir evāsmā ime lokāḥ pra bhānti |  
Because he places the animal-heads, the ritualist lives (breathes) by
means of them in that \[other\] world; also indeed these worlds shine
forth for him by them (the heads).

mṛdābhilipyopa dadhāti medhyatvāya |  
Having smeared them (the heads) with mud for ritual purity, he places
them down.

paśur vā eṣa yad agnir annam paśava eṣa khalu vā agnir yat paśuśīrṣāṇi
|  
Agni, indeed is \[embodied in\] an animal; animals are food; verily the
animal-heads are this Agni.

yaṃ kāmayeta kanīyo ‘syānnam syād iti saṃtarāṃ tasya paśuśīrṣāṇy upa
dadhyāt kanīya evāsyānnam bhavati |  
If he perhaps wishes that: ‘May his food be less’, he should lay his
animals-heads more closely together; verily his food becomes less.

yaṃ kāmayeta samāvad asyānnaṁ syād iti madhyatas tasyopa dadhyāt
samāvad evāsyānnam bhavati |  
If he perhaps wishes that: ‘May his food remain the same’, he should lay
his animals-heads medium \[spacing apart\]; verily his food remains the
same.

yaṃ kāmayeta bhūyo ‘syānnaṁ syād ity anteṣu tasya vyudūhyopa dadhyād
antata evāsmā annam ava runddhe bhūyo ‘syānnam bhavati ||  
If he perhaps wishes that: ‘May his food be more’, he should lay his
animal-heads widely-separated at the ends of the pit; verily by
enclosing the food his food becomes more.

Thus, the different animal-heads being placed at the base of the soma
ritual altar are reminiscent of the multiple heads of different animals
found at the Celtic site. While in many modern performances clay or
golden heads might be used, it is clear that in the earlier ritual
actual heads were used. As for the human head it is apparent that it was
not obtained by human sacrifice in the core śrauta tradition. Āpastamba
clarifies that the corpse of a Kṣatriya or Vaiśya who has been slain in
warfare by an arrow or struck dead by lightning is purchased for 7 or 21
units of cash and the head is severed at the time of the sale. The
Kaṭha-s clarify that a dead man’s head is bought for 21 units of cash
at a cemetery and severed from the corpse at the time of purchase.

Finally, coming to the issue of chimeric animals in the veda, we might
cite the famous verse of Vāmadeva Gautama on the embodiment of Sanskrit
language as chimeric animal:

catvāri śṛṅgā trayo asya pādā  
dve śīrṣe sapta hastāso asya |  
tridhā baddho vṛṣabho roravīti  
maho devo martyāṃ ā viveśa || RV 4.58.3

Four horns, his feet are three,  
his heads are two, his hands seven;  
bound thrice the bull roars,  
the great god has entered into the mortals.

The god Agni enters the mortals as the Sanskrit language comprised of:  
4 four horns: nominals, verbs, preverbs and particles.  
3 feet: the 3 accents of the old language.  
2 heads: the vocalized word and the inner word associated with the first
person experience of meaning.  
7 hands: the 7 cases  
3 bonds: The articulations in the lungs, throat and head that express
the language in spoke form.

We shall be elaborating on this and its significance to the performance
of ritual in a separate story.
