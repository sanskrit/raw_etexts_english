1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*17th March, 1900*.

DEAR MOTHER (Mrs. Leggett.),

I had a letter from Joe asking me to send my signature on four slips of
paper, so that Mr. Leggett may put my money in the bank for me. As I
cannot possibly reach her in time, I send the slips to you.

I am getting better in health and doing financially something. I am
quite satisfied. I am not at all sorry that more people did not respond
to your call. I knew they would not. But I am eternally thankful to you
for all your kindness. May all blessings follow you and yours for ever.

It is better that my mail be sent to 1231 Pine Street, C/o the Home of
Truth. For though I be moving about, that place is a permanent
establishment, and the people there are very kind to me.

I am so glad to learn that you are very well now. Mrs. Melton has left
Los Angeles — I am informed by Mrs. Blodgett. Has she gone to New York?
Dr. and Mrs. Hiller came back to San Francisco day before yesterday.
They declare themselves very much helped by Mrs. Melton. Mrs. Hiller
expects to get completely cured in a short time.

I had a number of lectures here already and in Oakland. The Oakland
lectures paid well. The first week in San Francisco was not paying, this
week is. Hope the next week will pay also. I am so glad to hear the nice
arrangement made by Mr. Leggett for the Vedanta Society. He is so good.

With all love, 

Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Do you know anything about Turiyananda? Has he got completely
cured? 

V.
