title = "saMmelana song of the vIra"

+++
It was the saMmelana of the holders of the kapAla  
in the great shmashAna of kollagiri, in quest of mahAnaya.  
We were reclined in the haze of the pyres;  
the embrace of our dUtI fanning the inner fires;  
the fire of the kulayAga leaping to accept the mahAhuti.  
The songs of the melApaka and the signs of the yoginI;  
aroused the visions of the ten: first the panther;  
lion, jackal, monkey and bear, one after the other;  
woman, eagle, crocodile, elephant, and horse thereafter.  
In the shmashAna we call kaMkAlI, O raNachaNDI;  
O mistress of the eighteen yantra-s, O trishUlinI.  
We partake of this great gaNachakra celebration,  
conjoined with the dUtI attaining heightened cognition.  
Pride incarnate of the great bhairava, buster of the triple-planets  
The wielder of the great scimitar, in the crematorium manifests.  
Beating our resounding Damaru we experience her great passage;  
through the neural kulapatha, splitting triple-points of bondage.  
In the great nocturnal conjunction with the kulA\~NganA  
we visualize in her pleasure-giving yoni, the r-blUM bIja.  
Verily he who succeeds in joining kphreM with rblUM;  
meditating on her slaying raktabIja dons the armor of huM.  
Thus, he may step for battle, fearless, to fight bhrAtR^ivya-s,  
intending to offer them in the great saMgrAma as nara-balI-s.
