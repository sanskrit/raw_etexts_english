title = "avyakta origin mythology"

+++
The two tantric upaniShads, avyakta and nR^isiMha-tApini are clear in
their pA\~ncharAtra affinities. Yet the saMkhya origin mythology of the
avyakta is a pretty remarkable piece that is worth considering, for it
is a rather distinctive expression of earliest stages of the universe.
While in general concepts is similar to the thoughts expressed in other
pA\~ncharatra sAMkhya origin mythologies, such as the lakShmi-tantra, it
different in the details. Of course it does not go into the details of
the ta\~nmAtras and their ontology like the account in the viShNu
purANa, but its clarification of the early events in just two paragraphs
is useful.

In the past there was neither the heavens, nor the mid-regions nor the
earth. There was only an entity of the form of light, which was without
a source nor end, it was neither an atomic particle nor a continous
mass, it had not distinct form, yet had a certain distinctness, it was
unknowable, yet of the was of the form of information, it was endowed
with the “blissful” consciousness.

That one entity without a second then produced a pair, one ‘yellow’ and
the other ‘red’.  
The one which was red becme that form known as the puruSha.  
The one which was yellow became that form mAyA.  
The two united.  
Thus their generative power was satisfied.  
It expanded.  
It \[thus\] became the glowing \[golden\] egg (hirANyagarbha).  
It underwent further evolution.  
From that emerged parameShTin.

- The word for evolution in the sAMkhya ontology, pariNamana is clearly
used.  
- The first paragraph and the first portion of the second roughly maps
to the philosophical account of origin mythology provided by the
nAsadIya sUktaM or the R^igveda. The second half of the second paragraph
corresponds to the hirANyagarbha sUktaM of the R^igveda. From these
ancient starting points it is interesting to note that the Hindus
developed several accounts of the origin of the universe each differing
somewhat in their details. Examples of such are seen the bR^igu smR^iti,
the manu smR^iti, and the later tantric texts. So these ideas have hoary
continuity in the Hindu world and should be considered the result of
endogenous speculation on such topics.
