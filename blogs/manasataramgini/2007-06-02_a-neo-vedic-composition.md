title = "A neo-vedic composition?"

R was giving me ride when we observed some sight that greatly reminded
us of a shared juvenile experience, that filled us with much fuzzy
nostalgia. At that moment R asked me if anybody could compose vedic
mantra-s again or sUkta-s. I asked what the criteria where and we seemed
to agree- they should resemble the original sUkta-s or yajushes and
should follow vedic grammar and should have correct vedic svaras. They
should be in genuine Chandas, adhere to the vedic lexical statistics and
deities. Evidently, even though later upaniShad-s have been couched in
vedic language over the ages they clear differ from the original. Nor do
the purANa-s even superficially attempt revival of the vedic form of
expression. Even though the vedic composers themselves saw their works
as kAvya, the later day classical kAvya is clearly distinguished from
its vedic precursors. So much so that the later day commentators and
stylists explicitly exclude the vedic kAvya from the classical kAvya.
Yet at some point vedic style composition was prevalent and at least had
one representative outside the Indian zone in the form of the avesta of
the Iranians. There is pANini, whose grammar describes the vedic
language, and by including the unpublished sUtra-s of the ArSha pATha
one could theoretically arrive at vedic composition. Yet we see hard any
such attempts to imitate to shruti.

But the muni informed me that there was one possible example. These are
the details I could gather:  
\-In 1917 a brAhmaNa named gajAnana sharma aka daivarAta from gokarNa, a
student of the great saMskR^ita savant kAvyakaNTha gaNapati shAstrI,
composed a set of 50 sUkta-s encompassing 448 R^ik-s.  
\-He said to have spontaneously composed this while performing
tapasya.  
\-The majority are in the jagati Chandas, followed by triShtubh, then
anuShTubh and finally a small set of gAyatrI-s.  
\-The primary devatA-s of his composition are agni, indra, sarasvatI,
savitA, bR^ihaspati, ApaH, vAyu, rudra, aditi and soma. He also has some
compositions on puruSha and other resembling the philosophical works
like the nAsadIya sUktaM.  
\-The R^iks are marked with svara-s and the composer also created a pada
pATha as seen in the traditional saMhitA-s

Unfortunately, copy of this was in the Telugu script and the gentleman
with a copy of this was my only source of obtaining the information. I
could not analyze it myself to determine if it met all other lexical and
grammatical criteria of a vedic composition. Nevertheless, from what I
could see it did seem a work worth considering as a candidate for the
neo-vedic genre. If only somebody printed a copy of it in the nAgarI
scriptâ€¦

gaNapati shAstrI was a great paNDita himself with a profound
understanding of the veda and he composed more modern veda inspired
compositions in saMskR^ita like the indra sahasranAmam to indra, indrANI
saptashati, gItAmAlA to various vedic deities, and indra gItamu in
telugu imitating a vedic praise of indra. It is clear that he was one of
those rare individuals who had a genuine grasp of the vedic thought and
action. Some people have the action to perform the shrauta ritual and
others the inspiration of the vedic mind. A true knower of the veda
understands both.
