## VIVE KANANDA LEAVES

——

HE TELLS SOMETHING

ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF HINDOO LABORERS.

Swami Vive Kananda repaid the admiration of his lady acquaintances by
writing verses, at the same time religious and semi-sentimental,
yesterday afternoon.[1](#fn1) He departed this morning for Ada, O.
\[Ohio\].

In a conversation concerning the material condition of the Hindu
workingmen, the learned monk said that the poor lived on porridge alone.
The laborer ate a breakfast of porridge, went off to his daily toil and
returned in the evening to another breakfast of porridge and called it
dinner. In most of the provinces the farmers were so poor that they
could not afford to eat any of the wheat raised. A day laborer on a farm
received only 12 pence a day, but a dollar in India brought 10 times as
much as it would in this country. Cotton was raised, but its fiber was
so short it had to be woven by hand, and even then it was necessary to
import American and Egyptian cotton to mix with it.
