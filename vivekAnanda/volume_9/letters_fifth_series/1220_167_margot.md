## CLXVII

*To Sister Nivedita*

770 OAK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

*18th May 1900*.

DEAR MARGOT,

Enclosed find the letter of introduction to Mrs. Huntington. She can, if
she likes, make your school a fact with one stroke of her pen. May
Mother make her do it!

I am afraid I will have to go direct to New York, as by that time the
Hales will be off. I cannot start for two weeks at least yet. Give the
Hales my love.

With love and blessings,

Yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.

P.S. I received your letter, including Yum's \[Miss Josephine
MacLeod's\].

V.
