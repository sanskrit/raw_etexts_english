Having had a major struggle with the forces of fate, and having been
reduced to the condition of Jx in a certain sense, and having dropped
the proverbial last wick of bhairavAnanda he was wandering around with
the wheel spinning on his head. They wanted that most tasty fruit that
grew atop the nR^i trees. But unfortunately for them they did not know
how to nurture such trees. Hence they spoiled their sapling quite badly
and there was no great success in getting the fruit. There was that talk
between the urvan of the tree and varuNa much like talk between the
urvan of the cow and Ahura Mazda. Hopefully varuNa answers the treeâ€™s
call. In the mean time as he wandered at the brink of the desert and the
khANDava jungle. At this point he wondered what if anything may save
him. He was asked to perform the pAshupata vrata. If pashupati wishes he
may be saved the itinerant pAshupata told. Thus, he lapsed into the
pAshupata yoga state.
