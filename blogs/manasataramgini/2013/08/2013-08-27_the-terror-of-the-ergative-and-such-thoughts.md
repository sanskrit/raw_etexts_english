title = "The terror of the ergative and such thoughts"

+++
In our youth we were confronted with the prospect of learning two New
Indo-Aryan languages, namely Hindi and Marathi. All around us were
native speakers of the latter language. Several of them were
multilingual and knew Hindi to different degrees and other languages
such as English or Sanskrit. But except for the well-educated most had
learned their languages instinctively. Not surprisingly, the teachers
who were supposed to teach us these NIA languages felt that there was
really no need for teaching grammar – it was something you acquired
naturally, they claimed, by just reading the pieces in the textbooks.
The lessons started with the nAgarI script. We were king when this began
because we already knew this script by way of the devabhAShA. Then there
was vocabulary. This too we fathomed due to the generic bhAratIya
vocabulary being relatively similar across tongues. However, we soon
realized that the going was not easy because, despite what the teachers
claimed, we really had to understand the grammatical logic of these
languages if we were to construct real sentences in them. So we began
our own grammatical analysis of these languages, which was fraught with
much tentativeness, in order to gain control over them. We soon realized
that the verbs took endings that were determined by the gender, number
and honorific state of the agent. It then dawned on us as to why our
chAchAjI-admiring teacher had torn into our essay for writing sentences
such as: neharUjI bolA: ham svatantra hUn | rather than: neharUjI bole:
ham svatantra honge\! However, the going soon got worse rather than
better as we hit the stone wall of the ergative in Hindi and Marathi. It
was as though we were the Inca troops of Atahualpa being blasted out of
existence by the mlechCha-s in the battle of Cajamarca. We had pulled
the plug badly enough that we were facing a premature existential crisis
in our educational career. At this point our mother interceded and asked
us to comparatively reanalyze the grammar of these species of NIA based
on a book she gave us. The book had an interesting sounding term called
the “ergative”, which meant that the verb ending took the
gender/number/honorific state of the object rather than the agent. Thus,
we realized that: neharUjI ne chiTTI likhe the | was wrong and it was
neharUjI ne chiTTI likhI thI | Thus, we plodded along and soon excavated
further complications such as the “ko” modifier, the use of “se” in the
instrumental and the ablative senses and why Marathi formed sentences
such as: tu tyAlA kiti paise diles | etc. Armed with these new
realizations we eventually gained a nominal understanding of NIA; at
least enough for us to pass in Hindi in what was termed the First Class.
Ironically, we fancied ourselves as being about as English as the
English themselves, but did worse in it in the final test than in
Hindi\! This left us feeling good about our understanding of NIA, but it
was not without it being seared into our cerebral recesses so as to
return periodically in the form of haunting dreams of sitting in the
Hindi examination hall\! We had wondered then as to why Hindi and
Marathi had the ergative but did not have even an inkling of an answer.
We asked kauNDinyA, who claimed Hindi to be like her mother-tongue, but
she had no explanation either. But my exposition of the bizarreness of
the ergative stuck somewhere in her head.

Many many years later, kauNDinyA told us that she was soaking herself in
elegant Hindi prose and much enjoying it, as though it was the scented
rice flavored with the pickle of Sanskrit. She asked us to read some of
the pieces she was reading, some Rahula Samkrityayana or HP Dvivedi or
some author I forgot on harisiMha nAlvA who took the war against the
marUnmatta-s right into Afghanistan. However, unlike her, we came off
worse from the readings in Hindi because that very night we woke up in
sweat from a dream of a dreadful Hindi examination in which we had
regressed to the state prior to our realization of the ergative – we did
not sleep for the rest of the night. No more Hindi literature, we told
ourselves. So when kauNDinyA asked us how we felt about her recommended
readings we confessed our predicament. At this point she asked us: “How
do you think the ergative came into existence when saMskR^ita does not
have it?” Suddenly, we had a flash of insight. We realized that it after
all did evolve in a proximal sense from saMskR^ita’s
instrumental-coupled past participle.

In classical Sanskrit a common use of the past participle is as an
adjective:  
mayA bhuktaM bhojanaM ruchiram AsIt ||  
The food eaten by me was tasty.  
mayA dR^iShTA lUtikA uttamA.asti ||  
The spider seen by me is splendid.

Note that in these constructions the agent is in the instrumental case,
while the past participle is being used as an adjective for the object.
Being an adjective in Sanskrit it takes the endings as per the gender,
number and case of the noun it describes. This use is clearly in the
passive sense as the so called object of the sentence is in the
nominative case. One can also use past participles in an active sense:  
chaShakaM gR^ihItvA rAmo .api maireyaM pItaH ||  
Having taken the chalice rAma then drank the maireya.

Thus, in this active form the past participle behaves has though it is
an adjective for the agent (rAma in this sentence). The same sense is
also conveyed in the manner of the earlier sentences if the participle
is used in a passive sense. i.e.  
rAmeNApi maireyaM pItam ||  
Here again the past participle takes the form of an adjective for
maireya, a neuter singular noun in the nominative.

Such past participle constructions form part of a well-known riddle:  
hato hanUmatArAmaH sItA harSham upAgatA |  
rudanti rAkShasAH sarve hA hA rAmo hato hataH ||

A naïve reader would be puzzled by this because it would read contrary
to what is known:  
rAma was killed by hanumAn; sItA attained delight; all the rAkShasa-s
are crying: Ha\! Ha\! rAma was killed, was killed\!  
Note the use of the past participles here: hataH | rAmaH| hanUmatA ||
Here hataH is used in the passive sense with rAma in the nominative and
hanUmat in the instrumental with hataH taking the ending after rAma.
sItA | harSham | upAgatA || Here the past participle is upAgatA used in
the active sense hence it takes the ending after sItA, with harSham
(masculine singular) becoming accusative to denote its object-hood. In
the final foot of the shloka we have: rAmo hataH || (duplicated for
effect). Here rAma is in the nominative with hataH taking the same
ending but there is no agent specified. This type of usage where the
agent has been omitted (being obvious) is similar to the equivalent
passive construction in a language like English. Finally the answer to
the puzzle lies in writing it as:

hato hanUmatA.ArAmaH sItA harSham upAgatA |  
rudanti rAkShasAH sarve hA hA .ArAmo hato hataH ||  
hanUman destroyed the grove (ArAmaH, masculine singular, i.e.
ashokavana), sItA was delighted; All the rAkShasa-s are crying: Ha\!
Ha\! The grove was destroyed\! Was destroyed\!

Now coming to NIA languages like Hindi we can construct a sentence
like:  
dArvin ne patrikA likhI thI |  
Darwin had written a paper.  
The equivalent in the devavAnI would be:  
dArviNA patrikA likhitA ||  
A paper was written by Darwin.

It is the latter construct that gave birth to the ergative in several
NIA languages such as Hindi, Marathi, and several others. The
conservation of the “ne” particle across Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi,
Marwadi and the like showed that it was in all likelihood derived from
the instrumental ending of the agent coupled to the passive participle
in Sanskrit, even though in NIA it is used in the active sense. This
realization for us was like discovering a new homology among proteins,
with the accompanying realization of the evolutionary path and
uncovering of biological functions. Of course many others have done that
before us, and reams have evidently been written on the IA ergative.
However, our self-discovery of this was for us a triumph over the trauma
of the childhood trauma of the ergative.

Now why this kind of formation has emerged in the first place? The
Sanskrit construction is clearly logical and non-ergative passive but in
the NIA languages its derivative is ergative. This is no longer passive
and it does not correspond to the original active forms seen in Sanskrit
which were described above. Rather via the ergative it imitates the
Sanskrit use of the participle in an adjectival sense with respect to
the agent’s “object”. The ergative is rare in Indo-European and unlikely
to have been there in Proto-Indo-European (PIE). It is also absent to
our knowledge in Dravidian which is the other major language family of
India. So it was not acquired by contact with Dravidian. In IE the
ergative is primarily seen in the more vulgar dialects of Indo-Aryan and
Iranian (where it is much less common). However, it should be noted that
it is present in several Caucasian languages like Georgian, Circassian
and Chechen. It is also present in the mysterious isolate language
Burushaski from the Northwest of jaMdudvIpa and apparently in several
versions of Tibetan. We suspect that the original Indus languages also
used the ergative. Thus, it was probably present among the languages
close to the original Indo-Iranian homeland and also on the path of the
Indo-Aryans and the Iranians (at least part of them) to their later
lands of settlement. This trail of ergative users probably influenced
the Indo-Aryan and Iranian languages on the way to their final
destinations. In particular, in India the influence appears to have
resulted in Sanskrit first evolving a passive past participle formation
that could mirror the ergative without compromising the ancestral
non-ergative IE formations. This constraint was possibly strong in the
elite version of the language (i.e. Sanskrit; also Avestan on the
Iranian side). This was probably less so in the more vulgar forms of
Middle Indo-Aryan leading to ergativity creeping into Indo-Aryan in its
full-fledged form albeit via formations inherited from Sanskrit.
Interestingly, Sumerian and Hurrian also apparently display some
ergativity, but its absence in PIE argues against the “Anatolian theory”
of PIE, which in any case has several serious problems.
