## CXV

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7274e6115.pdf)* )

C/O E. T STURDY, ESQ.,  
HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING  
*1896*.

DEAR—

... Can anything be done unless everybody exerts himself to his utmost?
"उद्योगिनं पुरुषसिंहमुपैति लक्ष्मीः" etc.— "It is the man of action, the
lion-heart, that the Goddess of Wealth resorts to." No need of looking
behind. FORWARD! We want infinite energy, infinite zeal, infinite
courage, and infinite patience, then only will great things be achieved.
. . .

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
