title = "A brief summary of the state of early Indian history"

For a moment let us set archaeology aside and examine what textual
evidence is available for the dates in early Hindu history.

Generally people accept the following relative chronology:  
\-Early/middle layers of the R^igveda, parts of the atharva veda.  
\-Latest R^igveda, core atharva veda, core yajur veda  
\-Events of the rAmAyaNa  
\-vedAnga jyotiSha, core events of mahAbhArata, late vedic material  
\-systematization of vedic saMhitas, shrauta rituals, janamejayaâ€™s
conquest of takshashila  
\-first purANas composed, end of vedic composition  
\-brahminical sutra literature begins  
\-pANini, kaNAda  
\-buddha  
Other assumptions that generally may be accepted:  
\-based on their content it appears that the brAhmaNas/upaniShats were
composed starting from the circum-rAmAyaNa period right down to the
sutra period.  
\-many hindu texts are layered and mix compositions of different ages.  
\-Most of the records are pUru-centric, followed by ikshvAku, yadu,
videha/kanyukubja. There were significant areas of Indo-Aryans who did
not belong to this basic extended core. These included, for example
haihaya yadus, some anu kingdoms, bR^ihadrathas, kAshis, pragjyotiShas.

Main inference that may be drawn regarding dates:  
\-In my examination both the epics while having several astronomical
allusions represent mixed tradition. Hence it is obvious that one gets
widely conflicting dates.

\-However, the itihAsa and purANa tradition have memory of a very long
standing series of monarchs amidst many Indo-Aryan dynasties: 80-95
generations from the start to the bhArata war. These lists are largely
consistent across various purANas and epics, hence the lists of this
size could not have been simply concocted. Hence, even with a
conservative estimate about 1700 years had elapsed since the bhArata war
to the start of Indian memory.

\-In my opinion the best way of obtaining historical dates is by using
astronomical data. We get one such anchor point in the form a series of
hymns from the yajurvedic and and atharva vedic corpus in the form of
the kR^ittika at 0 hr on Spring equinox. This constellation is very
closely linked to some very basic vedic rituals and hence it is very
contrived to imagine it as being a reminiscence. Also by the time of the
vedAnga jyotiSha a change had occured in the 0hr and this was
recognized. There are allusions to an earlier equinotical point in the
rohiNi nakshatra. These facts have been known for more than 100 years
now and its plain foolishness on the part of detractors to wish them
away. If one were to believe them the Indo-Aryans only reminisced of the
past but never composed anything regarding the present.

\-From these observations one can calculate the sheet anchor kR^ittika
date as being \~2200BC, that is the core yajur/atharvan period. The core
yajur brAhmaNa portions were clearly after this period and contain
mentions of kings corresponding to the bhArata war era, like
vichitravIrya, dhR^itarAshTra and janamejaya. So the bhArata war was
well after 2200BC. And based on the earlier astronomical allusions in
the R^ig and brahminical genealogies the early phase of the R^ig can be
placed around 3100 BC. Considering that some of the early kings in the
purANic king lists such as mandhAtA, trasadasyu, purukutsa, mudgala,
bhR^imyashva and vishvAmitra span a part of the early R^igvedic period
one may fix the bhArata war era as definitely occurring after 2000BC and
probably even after 1500 BC. The most plausible dates being between
1500-1000 BC. This also matches the paurANic testimony of the bhArata
war relative to the nanda regime.

\-If the Indus valley civilization had shown clear Hindu (Indo-Aryan)
characteristics then one may have safely assumed that all this history
played out entirely in Greater India, with a pre-R^igvedic, pre-IVC
Indo-European invasion of India. However, this is not exactly the case
and hence one is left with the invasion and Aryanization during the IVC
as the best option.

\-IVC archaeology is not really in an advanced state and hence not much
can be made of the details from the existing information.

\-So after all New Ayodhya, New Kanyakubja may not be far fetched.
