There has been much abuzz in our maNDala on the genetic support for
Aryan invasion and allied issues of racial differentiation of human
populations. In this regard, most of us in the know, now clearly see
that the thing called the Aryan invasion is about the origins of the
IEanâ€™s of India and there is little doubt that IEans originated outside
India. The more interesting issue is the matter of racial relationships.
In this regard it is clear that the massive autosomal data is going to
bear on us in many ways. All of us in our maNDala obviously turn to the
now famous Shriver et al paper from Human Genomics last year. It is just
a sample of things that can be done. Below is the plot they generated of
the first and second principle components of their data of 11,555 SNPs
from 12 different human populations:  
1\) Upper Caste Hindus 2) Lower Caste Hindus /(I need to see how good
their definitions are)  
3\) Spanish  
4\) Japanese  
5\) Altaians (Mongolic people of Central Asian Altai of Russia)  
6\) Chinese  
7\) Mbuti- the pygmies of Zaire, Africa.  
8\) Burunge- A Tanzanian tribe speaking an Afro-Asiatic/Semitic language
of the southern branch  
9\) Mende- A West African (Sierra Leone) tribe of Niger-Congo (Bantuoid)
speaker. Their leader Kisimi Kamala invented a script for their language
in the 1800s.  
10\) Quechua- The south American Andean people, the Inca peoples  
11\) Nahua- A native American people found in Mexico and central
America  
12\) Nasioi- a Papuan tribe from the island of Bougainville

What the plot shows is that distinct clusters are formed:  
1\) The Quechua and Nahua are thoroughly mixed with not much
differentiation between them.  
2\) The Chinese, Japanese and Altaians form a clear cluster with
noticeable overlap, though there is some differentiation in their
populations.  
3\) The Spanish, Upper and Lower Caste Indians form a close cluster
approximately comparable to the Chinese, Japanese and Altaians in
clustering.  
4\) The 3 Africans form three distinct clusters with no overlap but are
generally closer to each other than anyone else.  
5\) The Papuans lie all on their own.

Thus the racial definition from physical anthropology is partly
reproducible through molecular results, but there are issue missed byt
it:  
1\) The Hindu-Spanish cluster is apparently congruent with the Caucasian
physical type.  
2\) The Chinese-Japanese-Altaian cluster is congruent with the Mongoloid
physical type.  
3\) The Native American cluster is indicative of a Native American
physical type that was previously linked to Mongoloid in physical
classification, but given their long isolation are likely to indeed be
distinctive.  
4\) The Blacks are a more diverse group than many imagine. In fact the
distinct African groups have had a long history of diversification
through isolation.

Of course the isolation of Papuans is not a matter of surprise. Further
developments of such studies are going to be of greatest importance in
understanding recent human biodiversity and evolution, and probably
provide information complementary and beyond those inferred from
uniparental markers.

Now in terms of linguistics, it appears that in Africa the divergence of
the major groups also corresponded to the break up of the languages
families like Niger-Congo, Afro-Asiatic and the like. So is it possible
that the diversification of the Mongoloid cluster in Asia corresponds to
the divergence of Sino-Burman, Altaic and Japanese? Finally the issue of
Indo-European and Caucasian diversification comes up. Here is where the
future data will be of most interest to address the IE and Aryan
invasion issues.
