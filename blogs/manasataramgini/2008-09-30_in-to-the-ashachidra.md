The chakra of the yuga had turned,  
Life by five saMvatsara-s had onward moved,  
Does AyuvR^iddhi also mean yama has closer approached.

The past seems partly forgotten and partly telescoped,  
Impelled by the mindâ€™s diktat we had ahead foraged,  
In saying so had we the stochasticity of neurotransmission ignored?

From place to place like kApAlika we had wandered,  
Like a toad we had from nook to nook we had saltated,  
Like indra the realms we had conquered.

But lay in the hazy future, we wondered,  
For indeed vasiShTha said no man has the future cognized\!
