## ON THE BRAHMO SAMAJ

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 1, p. 215.)

\[*Iowa State Register*, December 1, 1893\]

Before he left the city \[Des Moines, Iowa\], Vive Kananda took occasion
to say a warm word of praise for the Bramo-Somaj \[*sic*\], the work it
is doing in India, especially for the women, and of its representative
in this country. The visit of Vive Kananda, stirring as it did the
intellectual centers of the city to their depths and starting a lively
religious discussion, prepared the way for the present visitor
\[Nagarkar\] from the Orient and heightened public interest in whatever
he might have to say.
