## CLXIII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

1719 TURK STREET,  
SAN FRANCISCO,  
*12th March, 1900*.

MY DEAR DHIRA MATA,

Your letter from Cambridge came yesterday. Now I have got a fixed
address, 1719 Turk Street, San Francisco. Hope you will have time to pen
a few lines in reply to this. I had a manuscript account sent me by you.
I sent it back as you desired; besides that, I had no other accounts. It
is all right.

I had a nice letter from Miss Souter from London. She expects to have
Mr. . . . to dine with her.

So glad to hear of Margot's success. I have given her over to you, and
am sure you will take care of her. I will be here a few weeks more and
then go East. I am only waiting for the warm season.

I have not been at all successful financially here, but am not in want.
Anyway, things will go on as usual with me, I am sure; and if they
don't, what then?

I am perfectly resigned. I had a letter from the Math; they had the
Utsava yesterday. I do not intend to go by the Pacific. Don't care where
I go, and when. Now perfectly resigned; Mother knows; a great change,
peacefulness is coming on me. Mother, I know, will see to it. I die a
Sannyasin. You have been more than mother to me and mine. All love, all
blessings be yours for ever, is the constant prayer of

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Kindly tell Mrs. Leggett that my address for some weeks now will be,
1719 Turk Street, San Francisco. 

V.
