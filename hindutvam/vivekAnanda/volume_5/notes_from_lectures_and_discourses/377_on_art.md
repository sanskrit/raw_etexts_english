## ON ART

The secret of Greek Art is its imitation of nature even to the minutest
details; whereas the secret of Indian Art is to represent the ideal. The
energy of the Greek painter is spent in perhaps painting a piece of
flesh, and he is so successful that a dog is deluded into taking it to
be a real bit of meat and so goes to bite it. Now, what glory is there
in merely imitating nature? Why not place an actual bit of flesh before
the dog?

The Indian tendency, on the other hand, to represent the ideal, the
supersensual, has become degraded into painting grotesque images. Now,
true Art can be compared to a lily which springs from the ground, takes
its nourishment from the ground, is in touch with the ground, and yet is
quite high above it. So Art must be in touch with nature — and wherever
that touch is gone, Art degenerates — yet it must be above nature.

Art is — representing the beautiful. There must be Art in everything.

The difference between architecture and building is that the former
expresses an idea, while the latter is merely a structure built on
economical principles. The value of matter depends solely on its
capacities of expressing *ideas*.

The artistic faculty was highly developed in our Lord Shri Ramakrishna,
and he used to say that without this faculty none can be truly
spiritual.
