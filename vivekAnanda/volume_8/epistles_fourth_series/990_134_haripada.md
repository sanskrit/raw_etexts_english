## CXXXIV

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8414e8134.pdf)* )

*To Shri Haripada Mitra*

LAHORE,  
*16th October, 1898*.

MY DEAR HARIPADA,

In Kashmir my health has completely broken down, and I have not
witnessed the Durga-Puja for the last nine years; so I am starting for
Calcutta. I have for the present given up the plan of going to America.
I think I shall have plenty of time to go to Karachi during the winter.

My brother-disciple Saradananda will send Rs. 50/- from Lahore to
Karachi. Don't yield to sorrow — everything is in God's hands. Certainly
I won't go anywhere this year without meeting all of you. My blessings
to all.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
