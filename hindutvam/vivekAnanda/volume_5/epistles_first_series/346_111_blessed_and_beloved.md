## CXI

THE MATH, BELUR,  
HOWRAH,  
*29th August, 1901*.

BLESSED AND BELOVED (Shri M. N. Banerji.)

I am getting better, though still very weak. . . . The present
disturbance is simply nervous. Anyhow I am getting better every day.

I am so much beholden to mother (Holy Mother — Shri Sarada Devi) for her
kind proposal, only I am told by everybody in the Math that Nilambar
Babu's place and the whole of the village of Belur at that becomes very
malarious this month and the next. Then the rent is so extravagant. I
would therefore advise mother to take a little house in Calcutta if she
decides to come. I may in all probability go and live there, as it is
not good for me to catch malaria over and above the present prostration.
I have not asked the opinion of Saradananda or Brahmananda yet. Both are
in Calcutta. Calcutta is healthier these two months and very much less
expensive.

After all, let her do as she is guided by the Lord. We can only suggest
and may be entirely wrong.

If she selects Nilambar's house for residence, do first arrange the rent
etc. beforehand. "Mother" knows best. That is all I know too.

With all love and blessings,

Ever yours in the Lord,

VIVEKANANDA.
