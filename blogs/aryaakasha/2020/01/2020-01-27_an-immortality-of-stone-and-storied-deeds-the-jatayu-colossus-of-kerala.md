I have often maintained that India is a place wherein the past – and
here, I mean the folk-memory inherent in Mythic recollections and
retellings – is not merely ‘remembered’, nor ‘commemorated’ … but
actively re-immanentized into the living present. This is one reason why
it has still-living, still-vibrant Indo-European mytho-religious
tradition.

Now, what we see here is a small part of that. I say “small” – it’s a
physically *huge* sculpture, that’s about sixty meters in length. And it
represents the figure of Jatayu, from the Ramayana.

According to popular versions of this myth, Jatayu – a heroic avian
creature – had attempted to intervene in Ravana’s abduction of Rama’s
Wife Sita, and was cut-down by the demon emperor, maimed, and crashed to
earth near this site in Kerala.

Before dying from his wounds (note the rather large and
prominent-via-its-absence missing wing), Jatayu managed to croak out a
warning to Rama & Laxman of what had happened when they came across him
while searching for the missing Sita; as well as informing the Divine
Brothers that Ravana’s flight-path had headed South toward Lanka.

Now, all of that is pretty powerful stuff; but what makes it *resonant*
is not simply that somebody has taken the time and the care to construct
a downright megalithic monument to the moment in roughly the site where
the Mythic event is often held to have taken place. That would be
remembrant, and commemorant, true. But why it is *salient*, is that the
statue bears with it a set of values – moral enjoinment, ethos,
inspiration, and instruction.

To quote from the officially sanctioned English translation of the poem
that is written upon it:

“Stand atop this hill for a while in contemplation  
Here is where Jatayu fell  
Trying to block with his talons and beak  
The alien gnome who seized in deceit  
The priceless pearl of a daughter  
Born to the plough-furrow of dear Earth  
And fleeing to another coast.  
He who believes to be his right  
To possess even the celestial nymphs he covets

This is where the enemy’s sword  
Chopped Jatayu’s wing.  
The spot that accepted that flowing blood stream  
Like a sobbing mother accepting her martyred son.  
The spot received that bird  
Flapping its single wing  
Descending like a flag on the mast  
Of this country’s pride

Doesn’t this wind that blows here  
Sing that tale?  
Doesn’t every sand grain here  
Recall that Saga?

As we stand on this hill  
with heads bowed  
In the memory of that bird  
Who sacrificed himself as a flower offering  
We indeed churn immortality from death.”

Now, it does not take an in-depth knowledge of the Ramayana to feel
something when reading these lines. Although it is interesting to note
that the conclusion is, in fact, more broadly resonant – both with a
performative element common to regular Hindu worship practices \[the
giving of a flower in the direction of the Divine\]; and also to the
action of Shiva at the Churning of the Sea of Milk, wherein He
successfully derives the Amrit \[‘Mrit’, like ‘Mort’, meaning ‘Death’ –
‘A-‘ being the opposite of .. so “Immortality” elixir\] after first
suffering the Halahala \[poison of death\] as an act of self-sacrifice.
\[There is also, perhaps, a point of resonancy with the RigVedic
accounts of a certain other bird bringing Soma for the augmentation of
the fight against Evil; but more upon that, perhaps, some other time\]

I also found myself recalling the wise words of Shiva … in the Havamal –

“Cattle Die and Kinsmen Die  
Thyself Too Soon Must Die  
But One Thing Never, I Ween, Will Die  
Fair Fame Of One Who Has Earned”

“Cattle Die and Kinsmen Die  
Thyself Too Soon Must Die  
But One Thing Never, I Ween, Will Die  
The Doom \[‘Judgement’/’Renown’/’Reputation’/’Accordment of Honour’\] On
Each One Dead”

So, to bring it back to both the present and the plinth of this mighty
bird’s monumental remembrance-stone – what we have here is an
immortality ensured not merely through megalithic carving (although that
certainly also helps – albeit subject to what we might, perhaps, term
the Ozymandias corollary); but rather, supported via the *active*
connotation of commemoration (which is, after all, remembering
*together*), and the saliency of the moral example to be found and
thence lived even by the ordinary devotee.

Now in terms of what those values are – the official statement
emphasizes three elements. The first being the general concepts of
“chivalry and valour”. The second, that this is a reminder of an earlier
state wherein Man and Animals – that is to say, the natural world, the
environment, and the non-human creatures who are more of same – lived in
greater harmony. And the third, “a towering tribute to women’s safety
and honour”. Which, insofar as it entails the direct intervention when
some scoundrel is seeking to undermine such through criminal acts or
other indignity, is also what is entailed by “chivalry”; and, as applies
“valour”, one supposes can be extended out in a broader sense to
encompass interventions to assist and uplift people of whichever gender.

All three are, of course, concepts which are in general decline in the
modern age. Which is partially why it is so incredibly vital to go back
– both to the Past, but also to Myth – in order to actively *refresh*
ourselves, and to re-immanentize these core, cherished values back out
into the world around us today.

And this, too, is why it is so decent that monuments like this are made,
even in the current era. Although I am not quite sure, even leaving
aside the size, how frequent official state-sanctioned Indo-European
mytho-poetic masonry is made outside of India today.
