## AN UNTITLED POEM ON SHRI RAMAKRISHNA

(*Complete Works* (Bengali edition), VI, p. 256.)

सामाख्याद्यैर्गीतिसुमधुरैर्मेघगम्भीरघोषैः  
यज्ञध्वानध्वनितगगननैर्ब्राह्मणैर्ज्ञातवेदैः।  
वेदान्ताख्यैः सुविहितमखोद्भिन्नमोहान्धकारैः  
स्तुतो गीतो य इह सततं नं भजे रामकृष्णम्॥

He who was praised by the Brâhmanas, those knowers of the Vedas who made
the sky reverberate with the sacred sounds of the sacrifice and caused
the darkness of delusion to vanish through well-performed rituals and
the knowledge known as Vedanta — he whose greatness was sung in the
sweet chants of the Sâma-Veda etc., with voices thundering like clouds
(In Indian mythology clouds can cause both thunder and lightning.) — to
that Shri Ramakrishna, I offer my eternal worship.
