Due to multiple requests we decided to entirely redo and update our
previous note on the subject. The whole thing was re-encoded using
Unicode which hopefully allows cross-platform usability. The text is
provided as a pdf. Yes, I am aware that a lot is freely available on the
topic, but much of it, in our humble opinion, is confusingly presented.
