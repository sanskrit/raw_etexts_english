This thing came to my mind after reading a commentary on the nArAyaNIyam
of bhaTTathiri.

The statements such as these(that shiva is superior to hari or vice
versa,or statements like hari is subordinate/stories verses claiming
that vaiShNava nAmas/mantras,etc are the *sole* means to liberation in
this yuga should be seen as arthavAda). And what is this purpose of the
arthavAda?To stimulate single minded upAsanA of that deity(similar are
the functions of paurANika kathAs that glorify a deity at the cost of
other deities/by putting down other deities)

Now there are three types of arthavAda that are known in shAstra. They
are:

1.  bhutArthavAda:Wherin the existing/real attributes are stated in an
    exaggerated manner. E.g:Statements like ‘this medicine’s efficacy
    can revive even a dead man’ are only meant to drive home the point
    that this medicine is *really,very* good.
2.  guNavAda:Narrating attributes that are not/may not be really
    present,but might be feasible E.g:Statements like ‘[Have a salt
    restricted diet for prevention of heart
    disease](https://twitter.com/fioraesoterica/status/1079088709532700672)‘
3.  viruddhavAda:To narrate imaginary attributes that are neither
    present by nature,and are contradictory to valid pramANas,and are
    illogical.Therefore statements in purANas like ‘goptA viShNu
    tamomUrtiH vyApAreNa tu sAttvikaH’,’tadadhIno harI sAkShAt’,(viShNu
    is saturated with tamoguna but sAttvika by action),(viShNu is the
    servant of hari),then similar statements regarding bhagavatI have
    been made only to evoke greater interest in devotion to shiva or
    [bhagavatI amongst their respective
    literature](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/11/the-second-attempt-of-kama/).
    Or iconography showing shiva as a corpse ridden by tArA or
    dakShinakAlikA could also fall in that same category:As a feature of
    mantrashAstra meant to increase the focus on devI primarily and to
    emphasize her primacy in their scheme of things.

A similar analogy from mimAMsashAstra can be made regarding the
statements on when to perform agnihotra:’udite juhoti’ and ‘anudite
juhoti’. In the discussion on the importance of the pre-sunrise
period,the post-sunrise period has been censured,and similarly during
the discussion on the post-sunrise period,the pre-sunrise period has
been condemned. One on the basis of this should not stop performing the
ritual or perform it only once a day or vice versa,as it would result in
the dosha of contrariness,let alone the dosha of not performing
nityakarma. Hence,the conclusion of the shAstraj\~nas has been that both
have to be performed(as per the instructions received in the
perceptorial line of ritualists),and it is not that one performs the
sacrifice only once a day and condemns the ones who do it at other times
too as inferior. Similarly by this logic the putting up of a
deity(sometimes even at the cost of others) does not really mean
denigration of other devatAs.
