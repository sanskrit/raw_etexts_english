Just as we were about to deploy rakShoha-agni the kulu\~ncha action of
the ari destroyed our prayoga. We were briefly surprised but took
another route via shUlinI and indra-vajrabAhu. Then realizing that the
ari would launch a mid-night attack we deployed karNa-pishAchinI. The
first karNa-pishAchinI prayoga went through. The second one, which was
more important appeared to first go through but was smashed by the ari
counter-attack. So we then risked an attack and the 3rd kp prayoga was
deployed. This appeared to go through. Then there was an audacious
pre-dawn attack. Kp was called upon to feed even this time. Managing the
thing was stressful though. Time alone would tell if they really worked.
ari-s returned to attempt the stambhana and mAraNa; at least temporarily
we averted them.
