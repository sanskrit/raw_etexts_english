## LXIX

*To Sister Christine*

19 WEST 38TH STREET

*9th August '95*

DEAR CHRISTINA,

You must be enjoying the beautiful weather very much. Here, it is
extremely hot but it does not worry me much. I had a pleasant journey
from Thousand Islands to New York; and though the Engine was derailed, I
did not know anything of it, being asleep all the time. Miss Waldo went
out of the train at Albany. I did not see her off as I was asleep. I
have not heard anything from her yet. Hope to hear soon. Dr. \[L. L.
Wight\] and Miss \[Ruth\] Ellis must have gone home by this time.

We gave them a telepathic message but Miss Ellis has not got it sure,
else she would write.

I am making preparations for my departure.

I came in time for one of the meetings here and had another one last
evening — going to have one more this evening and almost every evening
till I go over.

What is Mrs. Funkey \[Mary Caroline Funke\] doing, and Miss \[Mary
Elizabeth\] Dutcher? Do you go to meditate on the mountain as usual? Did
you hear from Kripananda?

Write to me as soon as you can — I am so anxious to hear from you.

Ever yours with blessings and love,

VIVEKANANDA

P.S. My love and blessings to Mrs. Funkey and Miss Dutcher.

V.
