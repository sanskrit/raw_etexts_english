There are three main aspects of the decline of Śaiva siddhānta tāntrika
systems and confining it to mainly the Tamil lands



1.  Loss of patronage in the North due to Muslim invasions+active
    iconoclasm by them.The last rulers who could do this(patronage) to
    some extent in the North would be the family in which Rani Durgavati
    married in.
2.  When Vijayanagara came to power,it elevated the Telugu smārta-s and
    disenfranchised the Ādiśaivas(replacing them with Telugu brāhmaṇas).
3.  After the very brief revival it enjoyed due to people like Arumuga
    Navalar,it became a tool in the hands of Dravidianist ideologues who
    distorted it out of it contexts.

However,the works of Sekkizhar,and the works of Sundarar and Nambiyandar
Nambi ensured that the system survived in the popular devotional
consciousness in those lands even after their patronage declined.
