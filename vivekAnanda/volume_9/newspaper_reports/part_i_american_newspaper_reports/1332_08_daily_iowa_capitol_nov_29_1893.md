## REINCARNATION

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 1, p. 206-7.)

\[*Daily Iowa Capitol*, November 29, 1893\]

Swami Vivekananda last night talked of reincarnation. (Of which there is
no verbatim transcript available.) It is based, he contended, on the
fact that there never has been a new creation; that creation has existed
coevally with God from all eternity. Departed souls find bodies to
inhabit either better or worse than their former tenement, according as
they made them fit for one or the other. The lecturer will speak again
on Thanksgiving evening at the same place on the manners and customs of
India.
