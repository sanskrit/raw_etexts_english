The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute was founded in
1915. The first verse of the Mahabharata was written by Sir R. G.
      Bhandarkar on 1st April 1919 while inaugurating the work of the
      Institute on the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata. On 4th August
      1925 Dr. V. S. Sukthankar took charge of this work as its General
      Editor and reorganized it on a sound basis. For the subsequent 17 years
      he worked on it with an eagle eye and mature scholarship bringing
      international honour to himself and to the Institute. In 1940, the
      British Academy, London, put its seal of approval on Dr. Sukthan-
      kar’s work on this edition. On the 4th January 1943, the Institute
      conferred on Dr. Sukthankar a Distinguished Services Medal in
      recognition of his unique services to the Institute as the helmsman of
      its work on the Mahhbharata on the occasion of its Silver Jubilee
      celebrations. On 5th January 1943, Dr. Sukthankar read his state-
      ment on the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata before the delegates
      for the Silver Jubilee celebrations and other audience in the Tata Hall
      of the Institute. This statement has proved to be his last testament
      more valuable than Aristotle’s will as it is a national testament. I
      quote from it a few sentences which contain Dr. Sukthankar’s mes-
      sage about the Mahabharata : —

“ The part of the Epic critically dealt with so far is, I imagine, in bulk
about four times as great as the Greek Epics, Iliad and Odyssey put together
and one and a half times as our Riamayaipa.”

“ All good work costs money now-a-daiys ! Good manuscripts cost
money. Good printing costs money. Good editors cost money.”

“ Amid the deepest strands that are woven in the thread of our civili-
zation there is more than one that is drawn originally from Bharatavarsa
and from Sanskrit literature and well in the centre of this vast mass of lite-
rature, there stands this deathless traditional book of divine inspiration, un
approachable and far removed from possibilities of human constitution.”

“ We must therefore grasp this great book with both hands and face it
squarely. Then we shall recognise that it is our past which has prolonged
itself into the present. We are it : I mean the real We ! Shall we be guilty
of strangling our own soul ? Never ! ”

These stirring words were read out by Dr. Sukthankar on the
evening of the 5th of January and within a fortnight he pa?s^ away
after a brief illness on the evening of 21st January 1943 ! Truth is
stranger than fiction !!

Such in brief is the outline of Dr. Sukthankar’s association with
the Institute’s Critical Edition of the Great Epic, which he aptly styled
as “ the Content of our Collective Unconscious ” and in which he

finally merged his being after spending every moment of his conscious
life in revising his type-script of the last of his lectures on the Maha-
bharata he was to deliver before the University of Bombay on the
following day !

In striking him down within sight of his chosen goal, Death
pierced the base of consciousness, cutting at the very joint of body and
mind. No preparation for the end, no inspiring last words, were pos-
sible. Yet, those of us who knew Sukthankar intimately cannot
doubt that the sentiments of Valiant would also have been his own had
he received the summons of an approaching end to life’s journey.
“ Though with great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not repent
me of all the trouble. My sword I give to him that shall succeed me
in the pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it.
My marks and sccirs I carry with me, to be a witness for me, that I
have fought His battles Who will be my Rewarder.” This memorial
volume represents the sword, the keen splendid-tempered image of his
intellect, that he bequeathed to him that has the courage and skill to
wield it. If there be such a person, undaunted by the forces of dark-
ness, let him grasp firm the hilt and smite on.

Side by side with his text-critical work on the Mahabharata
Dr. Sukthankar kept on studying its content and inner meaning and
for that purpose studied many books on Philosophy and Religion.
WTrile I was editing the Review oi Philosophy mid Religion between
1930 and 1937, 1 received numerous books on these subjects for review.
Dr. Sukthankar seemed very much interested in many of them and
he actually ordered some of them for his own library. I was first under
the impression that Dr. Sukthankar perused these books with a view
to get a little diversion to his mind after his fatiguing work on the text
of the Mahabharata day after day for years without rest. I was how-
ever thoroughly surprised when he disclosed to me his scheme of lec-
tures on the Mahabharata which he finally prepared for being deli-
vered before the University of Bombay and before completing which
he took our final leave with a “ Forget-me-not ” emphasis ! The
mystical vein noticed by the audience in those lectures was mainly due
to the psychological changes gradually brought about in the mind
of the great Savant during the ten years prior to these lectures.

The idea of bringing out a Memorial Edition of Dr. Sukthan-
kar’s published writings was first discussed by myself and my learned
friends Dr. S. M. Katre and Prof. D. D. Kosambi with Dr. Mrs.
Malinibai B. Sukthankar, m.b.b.s. and the sons of Dr. Sukthankar
immediately after Dr. Sukthankar’s demise. With the substantial
support iMTomised by the Sukthankar family a Memorial Edition



Committee was formed with Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, B.A.
the Raja Saheb of Aundh as its Chairman and Diwan-Bahadur K. M.
jHAVERi, M.A., LL.B., j.p. as its Vice-Chairman. With the assured
support of these two great friends of Dr. Sukthankar and with the
guaranteed voluntary co-operation of my esteemed friends Dr. Katre
and Prof. Kosambi, it was easy for me to secure the support of the
innumerable friends of Dr. Sukthankar all over India and outside
for the work of the Memorial Edition as will be seen from the Person-
nel of the Memorial Edition Committee which accompanies this Pre-
face. A printed Appeal was subsequently issued by me on behalf of
the Committee and circulated among scholars and institutions inter-
ested in the Memorial Edition. The response to this appeal from the
numerous friends and admirers of Dr. Sukthankar was extremely
encouraging and the First Volume of the Memorial Edition that is
being presented to the public today is a visible embodiment of this
spontaneous response and a permanent Souvenir of the good will left
behind by an Indian scholar who sacrificed himself on the altar of the
Mahabhiarata.

The valuable and scholarly contents of the present volume speak
for themselves and will continue to speak with greater resonance as
years pass by. As observed by Prof. Edgerton they are the product
of Dr. Sukthankar’s knowledge and experience (Jmnam Savijm-
nam) and his native ability which made reputation in three Continents.
Dr. Sukthankar’s literary life was a life of planned action, in which
every detail was scrupulously worked out and revised many times
before it saw the light of the day. Every page of the Critical Edition
of the Mahabharata and the Critical Epic Studies that are being
presented to the scholars to-day under one cover bear the stamp of his
scholarship and fully illustrate the common adage : — “ If a thing is
worth doing, it is worth doing well ”. His Prolegomena to the Adi-
parvan of the Mahabharata, the bed-rock of the Mah&bharata Textual
Criticism, was much in demand since its publication. It is being pub-
lished separately for the first time in the present volume along with
the other Epic Studies of Dr. Sukthankar and thus brought within
the means of individual research scholars through the favour of the
authorities of the B. O. R. Institute. I feel confident that this First
Volume of Dr. Sukthankar Memorial Edition will stimulate the
study of the Indian Textual Criticism on which the attentioa of Indian
scholars has been now focussed by Dr. Katre’s able Introduction to
Indian Textual Criticism (1940), which owes much to Dr. Sukthan-
kar’s inspiration and guidance.

It now remains for me to record my feelings of gratitude for the
unstinted co-operation I have received frojn several friends and learned

bodies in bringing out this iFirst Volume of the V. S. Sukthankar
Memorial Edition. My cordial thanks are due to the authorities of
the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, many of whom are mem-
bers of the Memorial Edition Committee, for their kind permission to
include in the present volume the Prolegomena and other Introduc-
tions to the Critical Edition of the Mahcbhdrata as also Dr. SUK-
thankar’s Epic Studies published in the Annals of the Institute.
Special thanks are due to Principal J. R. Gharpure, b.a., ll.b., the
Chairman of the Executive Board and Dr. R. N. Dandekar, m.a.,
PH.D., the Secretary of the Institute who is also the Editor of the
Annals, for their uniform courtesy and kindness in securing the above
permission. To Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, m.a., ph.d., the present General
Editor of the Mahiabharata, I am particularly thankful for keeping at
my disposal a copy of Epic Studies No. VI which he found in Dr.
Sukthankar’s office papers at the Institute. This copy duly revised
by Dr. Sukthankar in his, own hand has been incorporated in the
present volume. Evidently Dr. Sukthankar had an intention to re-
vise all his Epic Studies in course of time and then publish them in
their final form after the completion of his work on the Great Epic.
Providence, however, decreed otherwise ! As regards the other contri-
butions of Dr. Sukthankar included in the present volume I tender
my most grateful thanks —

(1) To the authorities of the K. R. Cama Oriental Institute,
Bombay, and the Editorial Board of Sir J. J. Modi Volume for p)er-
mission to include Dr. Sukthankar’s paper on “ Arjunamisra ” in
this Edition.

(2) To Mr. B. T. Anklesaria, m.a. the Hon. Secretary of the
K. R. Cama Institute for drawing my attention to the two p>apers of
Dr. Sukthankar viz. (i) Arjunamisra and (ii) An Excursion on the
Periphery of Indological Research and in securing the necessary per-
mission of the authorities of his Institute for their inclusion in the
present Edition. Mr. Anklesaria had collaborated with Dr. Suk-
thankar for a niunber of years in connection with his work for the
Cama Institute and his hearty co-opjeration in this work by the free
supply of the press-copies of the two papjers of Dr. Sukthankar men-
tioned above deserves my best thanks.

(3) *To the Editors of the Festchrift Prof. P. V. Kane and Dr.
R. N. Sardesai, L.C.P.S., Proprietor, Oriental Book Agency, Poona,
its publisher, for pjermission to include Dr. Sukthankar's |)ap)er on
“ RamopD&khyana ” in this Volume.

(4) To the authcarities of the Deccan College Post-graduate and
Research Institute, Poona and in particular Dr. S, M- Katre, m,a.,



PREFACE is

PH.D. its present Director and Editor of their Bulletin for their permis-
sion to include Dr. Sukthankar’s paper on “ Epic Question I — ^Did
Indra assume the form of a Swan ? ” in this Volume.

(5) To the Editors of Feschrift Dr. F. W. Thomas and its
publisher Mr. M. N. Kulkarni, the Manager of the Kamatak FHib-
lishing House, Bombay for their permission to publish Dr. Sukthan-
kar’s paper on “ RamSyana and Nalopakhyana ” in this Volume.

(6) To the authorities, Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society for permission to include Epic Studies I ; ‘ Some Text-Critical
Notes ’ in this Volume.

Every scholar who came into personal contact with Dr. Sukthan-
KAR knows quite well how he loved not only the substantial contents
of any scholarly publication but also its scientific and dignified presen-
tation. He believed in the identity of Truth, Beauty and Dignity in
the publication of all scholarly work worth the name. The volumes
of the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata are a visible embodiment
of Dr. Sukthankar’s ideal in this respect. A good edition according
to Dr. Sukthankar must be good both within and without, and we
have tried to make the present Memorial Edition as good as possible
within the' means at our disposal. But good Editions cost money, said
Dr. Sukthankar in his last public statement and the credit of achiev-
ing any goodness in the present Memorial Edition must go to those
donors, subscribers and contributors who have contributed their mite
towards this Edition out of sheer love and appreciation for the national
work of the departed scholar as will be seen from the list of these
contributors (vide Appendix). Space forbids me to thank all these
contributors individually. I shall however, be failing in my duty if I
do not indicate here the generosity of the following contributors but for
whose spontaneous response it would have been impossible for the
Memorial Edition Committee to proceed with the work of the Edi-
tion : —

Rs. 650 — Dr. Mrs. Malinibai B. Sukthankar, m.b.b.s. and other
members of the Sukthankar family, Bombay.

Rs. 150 — University of Bombay. *

Rs. 100 — Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, b.a.. Raja Saheb
of Aundh, Aundh.

Rs. 100 — ^Right Hon’ble Dr. M. R. Jayakar, Bombay. *

Rs. 100 — ^B. J. Wadia, M.A., ll.b., Vice-Chancellor, University of
Bombay, Bombay.

Rs. lOd— Sir Chunilal B. Mehta, kt., j.p. and Lady Tapibm C.
Mehta, Bombay.

On the completion of the Memorial Edition it is proposed to



publish a full report of the work of the Committee where all contri-
butions and donations will be specified in detail.

I started my work in connection with the Sukthankar Memorial
Edition with the assured initial support of Dr. Mrs. Malinibai B.
Sukthankar and other members of the Sukthankar family. This
support was further strengthened by the formation of a representative
Memorial Edition Committee consisting of numerous friends and
admirers of Dr. Sukthankar in different parts of India and outside.
This support, encouraging as it was for an inexperienced man like
myself, made me confident enough about the success of this enterprise
but I became absolutely fearless in my work when the two great friends
of Dr. Sukthankar, I mean Shrimant Raja Saheb of Aundh and
Dewan Bahadur K. M. Jhaveri agreed to guide me in this work as
the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Memorial Edition Commit-
tee respectively. Their high regard for our National Epic and its Epic
Editor Dr. Sukthankar has been responsible in no small way for the
publication of the Epic Studies of Dr. Sukthankar appearing today
in the form of the First Volume of the Sukthankar Memorial Edition.
On 5th January 1943, Dr. Sukthankar referred to the Rajasaheb of
Aundh in the following glowing terms : —

“ If you want me to point out just one man who is responsible for origi-
nating and furthering the project (of the MahSbharata) he is sitting in front
of you, I mean Shrimant Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, the Raja of Aundh.”

We are fortunate in having in our midst today, the first anniver-
sary of Dr. Sukthankar’s demise, this very enlightened Rajasaheb,
now in the 76th year to guide all our literary projects with undaunted
zeal and optimism. I cannot adequately thank the Rajasaheb and
other friends for their spontaneous and active co-operation in the work
of this Edition.

I began my work in connection with the Memorial Edition with
the guaranteed collaboration of my personal friends Dr. S. M. Katre,
M.A., PH.D. and Phrof. D. D. Kosambi, m.a. These friends have ful-
filled their guarantee to the very letter as they have been responsible
for the entire editing of the First Volume and all credit for the careful
and accurate editing of the Volume goes to them. During their per-
sonal contact with Dr. Sukthankar they knew perfectly well what
good editing meant according to Dr. Sxucthankar’s highly critical
standards and consequently the good editing of the present Volume
owes everything to them as they have carried out at great inconve-
nience to themselves all the arduous work of seeing the Volume
through the press. Though these friends have done all this labour of
love out of their high sense of appreciation and respect for the work

of Dr. SuKTHANKAR and though they are the members of the Memo-
rial Committee, I take this opportunity of thanking them most cordi-
ally for their disinterested service to Indole^ in helping the Memorial
Edition Committee to bring out the present Volume in the best pos-
sible form and get up.

Dr. SUKTHANKAR was connected with the University of Bombay
in several capacities for more than two decades. His cordial relations
with all the authorities of the University are evident not only from
the grant sanctioned by the Syndicate towards the costs of this Edition
but by the personal generosity of the Vice-Chancellor, the Registrar,
the Deputy Registrar, the Librarian and many other office-bearers of
the University. I am deeply touched by their prompt and spontaneous
l esponse to my appeal regarding this Edition and I convey to all these
friends of Dr. Sukthankar at the premier academic body of the pro-
vince the grateful thanks of the Memorial Committee for their sincere
appreciation of the work of the Committee.

In concluding this preface I must record the valuable services
rendered to the Memorial Edition by Mr. M. N. Kulkarni, the
enterprising Manager of the Karntak Publishing House, Bombay,
but for whose high regard for Dr. Sukthankar and spontaneous co-
operation on the very day this scheme was discussed we would not
have dreamt of undertaking this Edition at a time when the extra-
ordinary high cost of printing and the scarcity of paper had chilled
all academic enterprises in this country. Like my esteemed friends
Dr. Katre and Prof. Kosambi, Mr. Kulkarni has fulfilled his guaran-
tee also to the letter by publishing this First Volume of the Memorial
Edition most promptly and efficiently and thus kept up the high
traditions of his Publishing House for excellent printing and typo-
graphy, which are absolutely essential for good editing according to
the standards of Dr. Sukthankar.

In presenting this firet volume of the Sukthankar jMemorial Edi-
tion to-day, the first anniversary of Dr. Sukthankar’s lamented de-
mise, the Memorial Committee has completed half of its promised
work. Though I am thankful to all my colleagues on th* Memorial
Committee for their continuous co-operation so far, I must reserve my
final thanks to them to a future date when the Second Volume of this
Edition is completed and presented to the public. ^
