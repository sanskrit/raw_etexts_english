GHAZIPUR,  
*13th Feb., 1890.*

DEAR SIR,

I am in anxiety to hear of your illness. I am also having some sort of a
pain in the loins which, being aggravated of late, gives much trouble.
For two days I could not go out to meet Babaji, and so a man came from
him to inquire about me. For this reason, I go today. I shall convey
your countless compliments. "Fire comes out" that is, a wonderful
devotion to Guru and resignation are revealed; and such amazing
endurance and humility I have never seen. Whatever good things I may
come by, sure, you have your share in them. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Letters i - iv, vi - xiv, xvi - xxii, xxiv - xxvi, xxix,
    xxxi - xxxiii and cxxiv are translated from Bengali letters written
    to Pramadadas Mitra of Varanasi, an orthodox Hindu, for whose
    profound erudition and piety Swamiji had the highest regard. These
    letters are most interesting being written (except the last) at a
    time when, after his Master's passing away, Swamiji was leading a
    wandering monk's life. In the early days he used to sign his name as
    Narendranath, though his now famous name, Vivekananda, is printed in
    all these pages for easy comprehension.
