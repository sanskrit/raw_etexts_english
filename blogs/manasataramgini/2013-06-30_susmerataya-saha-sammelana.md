Holding a trident he arrived at the great smashANa at the foot of
kollagiri from the subterranean temple of nR^isiMha where he had
practiced the mantra of the adhomukha. It was in the midst of a storm:
the trees in the cemetery shook as though they had been struck by the
fist of the great ape vAlin. The shadows of their moving branches made
the spectacle look like the dance of the great karAlA holding severed
heads and diverse weapons in her hands. The clatter of the rain and the
occasional hail was like the drumming of the gaNa-s during the tANDava
of sharva. As each strike of lighting was followed by the great roar of
parjanya he uttered the vaShaT call. He proceeded to the shrine housing
the kShetrapAla upon which the great karAlA, also known as chaNDAkhyA,
looked upon. Seated at his chosen corner he silently witness a corpse
being consumed by the fierce kravyAda, with hissing and crackling noises
even as the long bones and skull exploded in the fury of yamavaha. In
his mind he was intoning the ancient bahurUpI mantra of the southern
face even as he turned the beads of his rudrAkSha rosary. Some time
after the anti-meridian hour the sky cleared completely revealing the
silver soma cup of the heaven. There was a rustling noise and shadows
indicated a new presence. The silence of the night was interrupted by
some voices. He heard the familiar voice of an Apastambin ritualist who
was negotiating with the cemetery guard for a fresh human head to place
beneath the chiti for his impending agnichayana. As the guard was thus
distracted in his duties, someone else slipped into to the smashANa. He
could tell that this was someone very different from the dancing shadow
and the enlivening scents of a female unguents though she hid herself
behind a karNamoTa tree. Raising his arm he showed the Chomma of the
bull-horns. She responded with the Chomma of the lion-claw, which he
picked up via the shadow cast in the shrine’s courtyard. He then
displayed the Chomma of the ghost. She responded with that of the of the
great reptile. He then showed the Chomma of eagle and she that of the
many-formed rudra. Finally they both simultaneous displayed that of the
“conjunct-churner”. She then came out into the open: He was shocked as
though he had come face to face to chAmuNDA herself, even as the breeze
blew her flowing locks in all direction revealing a skull in place of
the face. She laughed and raised her mask revealing her beautiful face
beneath.

*He called out:* “O susmeratA come forth we have been waiting for you
hoping to attain siddhi. Why did you come thus masked ?”  
*susmeratA:* “Wandering from the draviDadesha we arrived here and felt
that the the cemetery guard might block out way. Hence, we planned to
get in by either behaving like an unmatta-strI or frightening him with
that mask of ours. But to our luck we ran into an old acquaintance, the
Apastambin named mAra somayAjin, who in the path of the secret shaiva
shAstra was a student of our own teacher vijayA\~NkA from the karNATa
country who conquers like sarasvatI.”  
*He said:* “Indeed, you need to conceal yourself. What would people
think and say if they saw a respectable brAhmaNa girl, the daughter of a
great vaiyAkaraNa uddyotana, wandering thus in the midst of taverns and
cemeteries, when she should be tending the fire at her hearth. O conduit
of siddhi, we seek the 11-fold kaula path and its foundation of
bhairava-s.”  
*susmeratA:* “O vIra first reveal your former course in full.”  
*He said:* “We come from anahilapattana and are among the few who
attained complete siddhi of the practice of the kArttikeya mantra-s that
hardly anyone achieves. We then proceeded to study the oceanic shAstra
of the yoginI-s in the realms of kashmIra. There we dreamt that we
should proceed from towards the south and that you would come from the
draviDa country to take us on the path of attaining the state of a
vidyAdhara. O susumeratA, mistress of the saMmelana, we seek the yoga of
klinnAnvaya.”  
*susmeratA:* “We shall first embark on the 8-fold path which form the
base of the great throne of klinnA.”

There after she began revealing him the 8-fold mantra paths of:
niShkala-svachChanda, sakala-svachChanda, bahurUpa-bhairava, aghorIsha,
the vyAdhibhakSha-bhairava, chandragarbha-bhairava, vij˜nAnabhairava,
tumburu, and amR^iteshavara. For an year he practiced the mantra-s
devoted to constant purashcaraNa and the offering of agni-kriyA-s on the
specified days. There after susmeratA summoned him one darsha night and
said the test for your mantra attainment is will be via a mantra
contest. He on the path of the vidyAdhara should not be afraid of one.
She took out her rAvaNahasta and played the following song:

*“Bent on delighting in siddha-bhoga  
the vidyAdhara-s pour surabhi’s ghR^ita  
into the fire of the great klinnA’s trikoNa.*

In the space known as the kha-vyoman,  
though the space is within vyoma-vyApin,  
the vidyAdhara worships the wild vyoma-loman.

I am the one in the midst of the yoginI-jAla,  
exhibiting the high magic of the shambara,  
the sole sun blazing in the mayUkha-chakra.

I dance along with wild band of hR^illekhA and kledinI,  
with nandA, madanAturA and the restive kShobhanI,  
then with the glorious nira\~njanA and rAgavatI

With khekalA and the bewitching madanAvatI,  
ecstatically with drAvinI, speedily with vegavatI,  
I am the great rudra of the churning\!”

He felt an uncontrollable force tearing him apart. He felt lifted of the
ground and hurled as though he was shambara being hurled by maghavan
from atop his mountain fort. Coursing in the sky he flew like a
vidyAdhara passing over the many hued lands of the triangle of southern
jambudvIpa, occasionally bypassing a vulture and other times a flock of
waterfowl. Finally, he landed in an unfamiliar port town. He saw some
sights he had seen in the port near his own home town of anahilapattana
but this was an entirely different place. It seemed to be in the chera
country. Some vaNjia-s were offloading merchandize from Africa whereas
others were loading commodities to set out to Egypt or Iran. He wondered
how he would make his way here and why he had landed there in the first
place.
