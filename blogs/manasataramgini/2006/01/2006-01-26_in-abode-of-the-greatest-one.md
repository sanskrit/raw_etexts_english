indra is greater than all\!

vishvAmitro ha vA indrasya priyaM dhAmopjagAma shastreNa cha

vishvAmitra indeed went to the dear abode of indra due to his vedic
compositions and rites.

taM hendra uvAcha vishvAmitra varaM vR^iNIShveti |  
To him indra said, “vishvAmitra, choose a boon”.

sa hovAcha vishvAmitras tvAM eva vijAIyAM iti |  
vishvAmitra said: “let me know you”.

dvitIyaM iti | tvAm eveti | tR^itIyaM iti | tvAM eveti |  
i: \[choose\] the second time. v: You only. i: \[choose\] the third
time. v: “You only”

taM hendra uvacha mahAMshcha mahatI chAsmi |  
To him indra said: “I am the great (male) and the great (female)”

devashcha devI chAsmi |  
I am the god and the goddess

brahma cha brAhmaNI chAsmIti |  
I am \[the\] brahma power \[male\] the female brahma power.

tata u ha vishvAmitro vijiGYAsAM eva chakre |  
vishvAmitra verily still worked to know more.

taM hendra uvAcaitad vA ahaM asmi yad etad avochaM yad vA R^iShe .ato
bhUyo.atapAs tadeva tat syAd yad ahaM iti |

To him indra said: “I am that which I have said but what is more, he who
does no tapas may \[know what I am\].

tad vA indro vyAhR^itIr Uche tA upA.a.aptA Asanniti |  
Then indeed did indra proclaim the vyAhR^itis. They sufficed for him.

Indeed the chant of the vyAhR^itis is : bhur-bhuva-svarom |  
They fully describe the universe. Hence the shruti states: “yó víshvasya
pratimaánam babhuúva”- the universe is the image of indra.
