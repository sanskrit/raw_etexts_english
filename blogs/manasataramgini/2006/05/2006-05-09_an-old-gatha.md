title = "An old gAtha"

During the train journey we talked about ancient gAtha-s going back to
the PIE period. Some of these are clear cut sayings that were probably
present from the earliest days of the Indo-European crown group. An
early American scholar pointed the presence of an archaic Indo-European
maxim that occurs in classical Latin as: “quos deus pedere vult dementat
prius“. In the mahAbhArata (repeatedly) and the rAmAyaNa a similar
statement occurs as a gAtha:  
“yasmai devAH prayachChanti puruShAya parAbhavam |   
buddhiM tasyA .apakarShanti so vAchInAni pashyati || “  
For which ever man the deva-s prepare the overthrow, they take away his
mind, and he sees things inverted.  
  
The implications of this Indo-European unity are not perceived by modern
European and surprisingly even most modern Hindus. I place the idea that
this is because the modern Hindu mind was de-Indo-Europeanized by
colonization by the de-Indo-Europeanized Christian European.
