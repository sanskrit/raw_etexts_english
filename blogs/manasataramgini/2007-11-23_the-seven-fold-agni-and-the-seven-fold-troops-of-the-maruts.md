title = "The seven-fold agni and the seven-fold troops of thexa0maruts"

+++
In the agnichayana/agniShToma the following sequence of rituals are
performed:  
1)At the yajamAna’s gArhapatya the oblations to prajApati vishvakarman
are made.  
2)The adhvaryu carries forth the fire in the eastern direction
(agni-praNayana)  
3)The adhvarAhUti-s are performed in the fire established in the new
AhavanIya altar.

In course of \#2 the adhvaryu and hotar recite their yajushes and R^iks,
while the prastotA sings the sAman-s. In the agnichayana the
maitrAvaruNa additional chants the war-like aprathirathaM to indra.

The fire is laid in the new AhavanIya with a long yajurvedic chant
(KYV-TS 4.6.5), in course of which the connection between agni and the
bhR^igu-s, the first fire sacrificers is remembered:

agne prehi prathamo devayatAM chakShur devAnAm uta martyAnAm |
iyakShamANA bhR^igubhiH sajoShAH suvar yantu yajamAnAH svasti ||  
O agni, advance, first of deva-sacrificers, eye of the deva-s and
mortals; advancing in unison with the bhR^igu-s, let the sacrificers
attain light and well-being.

Then savitA is then invoked and the early a\~Ngiras ritualist kaNva is
also remembered:

tAm savitur vareNyasya chitrAm AhaM vR^iNe sumatiM vishvajanyAm | yAm
asya kaNvo aduhat prapInAm sahasradhArAm | payasA mahIM gAm ||  
That excellent, many-formed, all-encompassing pleasantness of savitA, I
choose; that mighty well-endowed cow of his which kaNva milked, with a
thousand stream of milk.

The final part of this recitation is that of the heptads of agni and the
marut-s.  
agni is first invoked, being described as a series of 7 heptads:

sapta te agne samidhaH sapta jihvAH saptarShayaH sapta dhAma priyANi |
  
sapta hotrAH saptadhA tvA yajanti sapta yonIr A pR^iNasvA ghR^itena ||  
That is: 1) 7 fuel sticks; 2) 7 tongues of agni; 3) 7 R^iShi-s; 4) 7
dear abodes of agni; 5) 7 oblations; 6) the 7-fold worship of agni 7)
the seven sources of agni, which are filled with ghee.

Of course this association of 7 with agni is often encountered right
from the RV itself.

Then 5 sets of seven fold maruts are invoked and asked to come to the
sacrifice of the ritualist and aid him:

This is one of the few places in the veda where the marut-s are
explicitly named. List 1 and 2 are again invoked in the KYV-TS in
1.8.13, in the same order, in rite of the mounting of the quarters in
the rAjasUya ritual. It is of interest to note that two of these names
are those of the seizing vinAyaka-s of the vinAyaka shAnti: mita and
saMmita. Thus, the link between the vinAyaka and the vedic sons of rudra
may be established (first proposed by the great savant Pandurang Kane).

The number 7 is associated with the marut-s from the earliest vedic
period down to the classical Hindu lore, as seen in the RV itself:  
RV 5.52.17: Here the maruts are said be 7\*7 (sapta me sapta)  
RV 8.28.5: Here the maruts are described as being 7-fold, bearing 7
spears and 7 glories.  
RV 10.13.5:Here the maruts are again said to be 7 fold.  
Additionally RV 8.92.20 might have an oblique reference to the 7-fold
troops of the maruts in the phrase: “saptá saMsádaH”.

In both the KYV and SYV the association is reiterated in many ways:  
In SYV-mAdhyamdina 9.32 (\~KYV-TS 1.8.9) the maruts are said to win 7
domestic animals with the aid of the 7-syllabled mantra.  
In SYV-M 25.4 (\~T.S 5.7.21) the seventh rib of the ashvamedha horse is
offered to the marut-s.  
In many yajurvedic ritual injunctions the maruts are made offerings on 7
kapAla-s.  
In KYV-TS 2.2.5, 2.2.11, 2.3.1, 5.4.7 it is stated that the marut-s are
made offerings on 7 kapAla-s because they comprise of 7 gaNa-s.

Despite all these allusions the choice of 5 lists of 7 each is a bit
puzzling, given that none of the above explicitly mention 5\*7. The only
possible mention is seen in RV 10.55.3:  
A rodasI apR^iNAdota madhyaM pa\~ncha devAn R^itushaH sapta-sapta |  
chatustriMshatA purudhA vi chaShTe sarUpeNa jyotiShA vivratena ||  
This is from a sUkta describing the universal form of indra, and is one
of those cryptic sUkta-s filled with hidden astronomical allusions. The
essential sense of the first hemistich of the above mantra may be
approximated thus: “He(indra filled the two hemispheres of the universe
and all that is contained within them, encompassing the 5-fold gods in
the 7 (or 7\*7) fold orders.” This appears to be a possible allusion to
indra’s companions the marut-s ordered thus, but this sUktaM being so
confounding one cannot be sure. There is a number 34 mentioned in the
second hemistich (=35-1), which is traditionally interpreted in this
context to mean 27 nakShatra-s+sun+moon+5 visible planets.

Finally, it should be mentioned that the “7” connection of the marut-s
is also seen in their successor and paralogous deity, skanda. We had
earlier discussed in our [note on the marut-s being being
“para-skanda”](http://manollasa.blogspot.com/2007/07/maruts-as-para-skanda-and-other.html),
how kumAra was made commander of the seven-fold troops of maruts. This
connection is further seen in ancient triannual rite to kumAra, known as
the dhUrta-homa and bali (the sacrifice to the roguish skanda) preserved
in the bodhAyana tradition. The recommended date for its performance is
the shukla-saptami of phalguna month. Again, in an invocatory verse used
in this rite kumAra is described as born on the the seventh day and
being a manifestation of the seventh moon phase. These points further
strengthen the connection between the marut-s and kumAra: before the
more popular ShaShTi connection over took the kaumAra tradition there
was a parallel tradition that connected him to saptami-s, consistent
with the 7-fold nature of the marut-s.
