In mahAbharata the fiercest fighting takes place on the 14th day and
vyAsa excels himself in the description of this awe-inspiring conflict
on the kuru field. After the killing of jayadratha by arjuna during the
evening solar eclipse the rage spilled over and rather than stopping at
sundown the battle raged through the night. One of the great battles of
the night was that between karNa and ghaTotkacha after the latter had
beheaded alaMbuSha. Finally, karNa slew ghaTotkacha with the shakti
given to him by indra in return for his kavacha and kuNDala-s.
