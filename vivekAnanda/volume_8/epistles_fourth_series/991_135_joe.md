## CXXXV

*To Miss Josephine MacLeod*

57 RAM KANTA BOSE STREET,  
CALCUTTA,  
*12th November, 1898*.

MY DEAR JOE,

I have invited a few friends to dinner tomorrow, Sunday. . . .

We expect you at tea. Everything will be ready then.

Shri Mother is going this morning to see the new Math. I am also going
there. Today at 6 p.m. Nivedita is going to preside. If you feel like
it, and Mrs. Bull strong, do come.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
