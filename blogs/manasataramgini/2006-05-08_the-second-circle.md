We had sought she who dwells in the midst of the kiri chakra. Our
AchArya’s AchArya the one learned in the great atharvan lore with all
its parishiShTha-s, kalpa-s brAhmaNa and upaniShads retired to live in
the most picturesque land south of lATa pradesha, with forests largely
inhabited by niShAda tribes. There on the banks of the Damanganga river
he settled down with the forest providing him the quietude and oShadhI-s
for his rites. We decided after the great battle of tIkShNa jvara to
proceed to the sylvan slopes of Damanganga to spend time in tapasya and
acquisition of the vidyAs of the goat-headed one and she who dwells in
the midst of the kiri chakra. We got into the train that bore us on the
long journey and then we used a ratha to reach the silent Ashrama on the
banks of the Damanganga to go with our acts. The setting was most
splendid. We found that path through which ShaShThinAtha and his wife
AryamekhalA had traversed the regions infested with fierce kirATas and
bhilla-s to reach the shores skirting the sahayAdrI’s. There we went to
the ancient kumAra gR^iha, we as the sun was reaching the western peg.
The pleasant breezes were blowing from the west and we sat by the
chaitya. The amaraugha of his includes rudra, himavat’s pretty daughter,
agni and ga\~Nga. The mAnavaugha began with vishvAmitra and haimavatI,
passing through, brahmAskanda, through ShaShThinAtha and AryamekhalA.
From him to saMbhadra and divyamekhalA. Then the mAnavaugha split into
the ogha of the adhoretas who moved along the paschima mayUkha and
pUrNagiri pITha and ogha of the Urdhvaretas that dwelt in prAchya
mayUkha and then moved to kumAra tapovana. We joined the adhoretasas,
being of this world.

As we were seated there we saw the amaraugha before our eyes- it was
like an immense flash of ullAsa. The amaraugha entered our mind. We then
beheld the immense chaturashra: The great mantras stirred the rasArNava
like the deva-s and the daityas stirring the ocean with mandhAra:  
oM namo bhagavate rudrAya skandAya huM phaT |  
oM namo haimvatyai vishAkhAya huM phaT |  
oM raM namo jAtavedase shAkhAya huM phaT |  
oM namo jAhnavyai nejameshAya huM phaT |  
oM namo nandikeshvarAya |

Then the deva chakra emerged by the grace of the amaraugha. It was the
supreme mantra chakra endowed with 24 spokes as it turned.

Then we saw the devI chakra of the great goddesses led by the most
splendid chatushpathaniketA, ketakI, bR^ihadambAlikA, the dolphin-faced
shishumAramukhI, lohamekhalA and the terrifying ghostly goddess
vetAlajananI. Then we saw the bitch-headed saramA and her companions
including lohitAyanI.

The word of the amaraugha flashed through us. We saw in urdhva-trikoNa:

oM hrAM hrIM hrUM hraiM hrauM hraH sharavanabhavAya ShaNmukhAya
shaktidharAya shikhivAhanAya kumArAya raktavarNAya kukkuTadhvajAya oM

kaM phaT ||

We went atop the hill reciting the mantra-s of bhadrashAkha: We
experienced the whole spectrum and beyond. It was high truth realized
through the vidyA of the gauhasphAnda. Then only mantra that came
naturally was the ShaDakShari. At one moment we saw without any effort
all the immense pleasures of the saMgama of the tikShNa-tripatha
strI-chUDAmaNi and  
the prathama-sundarI of the divyaugha. It was all within us- the second
circle had been completed. Then we were burnt by the fires which were
the torments of raurava and the hardships of tapasya. We enjoyed the
highest foods and then we were performing tapasya eating grass and
leaves. We saw the rahasya bindu in the middle– the glimpse of the
mahAvidyA, the priyaM dhAman of the deva-s.
