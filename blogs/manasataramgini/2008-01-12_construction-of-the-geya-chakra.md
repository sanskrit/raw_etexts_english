The geya-chakra of saMgIta-yoginI

Very few good specimens of the geya-chakra of shrI-vidyA are currently
available. There are a few historical yantras of shyAmalA available and
they are often inaccurately drawn. However, I happened to obtain access
to see some pristine forms that were prepared in vArANasi and nepAl.
These versions clearly indicate the symmetries and the geometric ideas
involved. As per the tradition of the mantra-mahodadhi of the medieval
tantric mahidhara, we also have evidence that the yantra of
sa\~NgIta-yoginI was congruent to that of mAta\~NgI in the
dasha-mahAvidyA series.

Like the shrI-chakra the geya-chakra encodes the Golden ratio rather
extensively, even if more directly: It has an innermost golden triangle
of the shrIchakra type which makes contact with the inner pentagon of a
pentagonal star polygon. This star polygon of course encodes the Golden
ratio in the construction of its sides with respect to the pentagon in
which it is inscribed. The pentacle in turn is inscribed within a circle
which in turn is bounded by an aSTha-dala padma and a ShoDasha-dala
padma. They are all enclosed within a square bhUpUra. The entire
construction as shown above can be achieved using a compass and
straight-edge. Such a construction was performed using C.a.R. to
generate this ideal representation of the yantra.
