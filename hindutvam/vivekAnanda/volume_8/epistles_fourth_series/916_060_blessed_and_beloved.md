R.M.S. "BRITANNIC"

BLESSED AND BELOVED (Mr. E. T. Sturdy),

So far the journey has been very beautiful. The purser has been very
kind to me and gave me a cabin to myself. The only difficulty is the
food — meat, meat, meat. Today they have promised to give me some
vegetables.

We are standing at anchor now. The fog is too thick to allow the ship to
proceed. So I take this opportunity to write a few letters.

It is a queer fog almost impenetrable though the sun is shining bright
and cheerful. Kiss baby for me; and with love and blessings for you and
Mrs. Sturdy, 

I remain, Yours,

VIVEKANANDA.

  
PS. Kindly convey my love to Miss Müller. I left the night shirt at
Avenue Road. So I shall have to do without any until the trunk is
brought out of the hold.
