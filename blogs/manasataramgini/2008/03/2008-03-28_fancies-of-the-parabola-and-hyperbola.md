Many revolutions-of-the-sun ago we were seeking a device that could
construct a parabola. We made a discovery in this connection that is
exceedingly elementary Euclid for mathematicians, but for us it was an
insight-giving philosophical revelation. A parabola can be made thus:1)
Draw a line L1;  
2\) Take a point P on it;  
3\) Draw perpendicular line P1 through P;  
4\) Take a random fixed point F, which will be the focus of the future
parabola;  
5\) Draw the segment FP;  
6\) Draw the perpendicular bisector line P2 of segment FP;  
7\) Mark the point Q where P2 intersects P1;  
8\) Track the locus of Q as P moves on P1, i.e. the locus of the
intersection of the perpendicular bisector P2 of FP with P1 as P moves
on L1;  
This locus is a parabola with focus at F. All the lines P2 are tangents
of this parabola.

We can obtain the equation of the parabola thus:  
Place origin O (0,0) at the minimum of the parabola;  
Then the focus F is at (0,a);  
Because P2 is the perpendicular bisector of FP we can show that the
equation of line L1 is y=-a using similarity of triangles;  
Coordinates of the point on the generated locus are Q(x,y);  
Hence, P(x,-a);  
By bhuja-koTi-karNa-nyAya: FQ^2=PQ^2; hence,
(x-0)^2+(y-a)^2=(x-x)^2+(y+a)^2;  
Thus we have y=x^2/(4\*a) as the equation of the parabola (or proof that
the locus of Q is a parabola).

We then found that if you repeat the above procedure with a circle C1 in
place of line L1, and a radial line P1 in place of the P1 of the above
example we get a hyperbola:
