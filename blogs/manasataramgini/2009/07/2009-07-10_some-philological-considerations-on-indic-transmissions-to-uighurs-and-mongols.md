title = "Some philological considerations on Indic transmissions to Uighurs and Mongols"

+++
The vaiShNava had brought my attention to a fragment of a text on vArAhI
sAdhana of the brAhmaNa shrIdhara that was transmitted to both the
Uighurs and the Chingizid Mongols. It described the yoginI-s in the
AvaraNa of eka-virA vajravArAhI. It presented a number of interesting
philological features that lead us to the study in greater detail of the
material collected by Shogaito in his analysis of Uighur and Mongolian
vocabularies:

|            |               |             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Sanskrit   | Uighur        | Mongolian   |
| chakravegA | cakira-a-vigi | cagr-a-bigi |
| khaNDarohA | kanta-roxi    | khaNDarohi  |
| mahAvIryA  | maxa-viry-a   | mahA-biry-a |
| suvirA     | suviri        | subiri      |

Other words:

|            |            |           |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Sanskrit   | Uighur     | Mongolian |
| chitra     | chitri     | citiri    |
| brAhmaNa   | biraman    | biraman   |
| kalpa      | kalp       | galb      |
| preta      | prit/pirit | birit     |
| shloka     | shlok      | silüg     |
| vajra      | vcir       | vcir      |
| virupAkSha | virupakshi | virubagsi |

Then we have the names of various deities:

|             |             |             |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Sanskrit    | Uighur      | Mongolian   |
| mahAdeva    | maxadivi    | maqadivi    |
| Aditya      | aditya      | naran (Mon) |
| soma        | soma        | saran (Mon) |
| bR^ihaspati | barxasuvadi | briqasbadi  |
| vaishravaNa | bishaman    | bisman      |
| buddha      | burxan      | purghan     |
| garuDa      | garudi      | garudi      |
| asura       | asuri       | asuri       |
| gandharva   | gandarvi    | gandarwi    |
| mahAsena    | maxaseni    | maqasini    |

E.g. of an Uighur text with recognizable words of Sanskrit origin (from
an inscription near Beijing from the reign of Toghun Temür):  
abitalI shaki-munili sarva-vitñeli  
akshobili vcirapaninïN besh ugush mantalï  
akshobi: akShobhya; sarvavitñe: sarvavij\~nA; shaki-muni: shAkya-muni;
mantal: maNDala; vchirapani: vajrapAni

One systematic rule concerning the endings appears to result in
Sanskrit\>Uighur: a\>i. Shogaito observers that this is not the case
with other Altaic languages like Mongolian if they directly acquire a
word from Sanskrit or via a Tibetan intermediary. Interestingly, when
Tocharian (an Indo-European language that geographically overlapped with
Uighur before the destruction and absorption of the Indo-Europeans by
the Turkic peoples) absorbs a word from Sanskrit we observe an a\>e at
the terminal. Likewise when Tocharian absorbs a Sanskrit word as an
“inanimate” gender it elides the terminal:  
e.g. shAriputra\>shAriputre; pAramitA\> pAramit;  
Thus, it appears that Uighur initially acquired its Sanskrit loans from
Tocharian as the Turks over ran the Indo-Europeans (of mummy fame).
However, it continued to retain the Tocharian type terminal
transformations, which explains the transformation of the Sanskrit words
that were subsequently absorbed by Uighur. The endings in Mongolian in
turn indicate that it subsequently acquired several already transformed
Sanskrit loans from Uighur.
