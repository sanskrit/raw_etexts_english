title = "Some comments of on the vyapohana stava and its pantheon"

+++
The vyapohana stava is an important saiddhAntika purificatory
incantation. It may be compared with other works composed by deshika-s
of the Urdhvasrotas such as: 1) the vyomavApistava of the Kashmirian
commentator bhaTTa rAmakANTha-II; 2) the shiva-pUjA-stava of
j\~nAnashambhu, a scholar from the Tamil country who worked in Kashi; 3)
the pa\~nchAvarNa-stava by the illustrious aghorashiva of the Tamil
country; 4) the ananta-vijaya-maNDala-stava of rAjA bhojadeva paramAra.
While those stava-s are of clearly human composition, the vyapohana
presents itself as a scriptural text of divine origin only retold by
human agents.

The sUta said: I will now narrate the auspicious vyapohana-stava which
confers all success. And having heard it from the mouth of nandin it was
expounded by the great kumAra to vyAsa. From him indeed it was
respectfully received by me \[the sUta\].

\[The sUta here is transmitting information from vyAsa as is typical of
purANa-s. However, as the post-vaidika shaiva tradition was expanding it
gradually began absorbing the kaumAra tradition within it in large part
in a subordinate position (However, in south India, especially the Tamil
country, the kaumAra tradition while colored by the saiddhAntika shaiva
tradition still retained much independence). In course of the absorption
of the kaumAra-mata kumAra was often placed as a intermediary who
transmitted the shaiva shAstra-s. In the early skanda-purANa, which is
primarily a shaiva text, shiva mostly does not act by himself, rather
using his agents to act on his behalf. In this kumAra is an agent of
rudra who acts repeatedly on his behalf. The other notable agent of
shiva is his famous gaNa nandin who is also often shown acting on his
behalf. Importantly, he is also presented as a major transmitter of
shaiva shAstra-s. Thus, kumAra and nandin, the major transmitters of
shaiva lore, are here placed before vyAsa and the sUta stressing the
point that this inheres from the core shaiva tradition.

\[Like several saiddhAntika shaiva AvaraNa stava-s, this one too begins
with the worship of the innermost maNDala and proceeds outwards. The
innermost deity here is sadAshiva with 5 heads, 10 arms and 15 eyes. As
is typical of the saiddhAntika tradition, he is seated in padmAsana on
top of all. A superb representation of such a sadAshiva from the Vanga
country, as expounded in the saiddhAntika tantra-s, might be seen in the
University Museum of U Penn. Despite the progressive establishment of
many levels of rudra ectypes in shaiva tradition, passing through the
early pAshupata-s, lakula-s, kAlAmukha-s and finally to the
saiddhAntika-s, his organic link to the old vaidika rudra remains clear
by the use of the ancient epithets bhava and sharva. Indeed, this is
made clear by the deshika-s, j\~nAnashambhu and the great-great grandson
of trilochanashiva, where they term the preferred form of sadAshiva
worshiped by them as rudrasadAshiva. Tradition informs us that in this
form he is visualized as holding the following in the ten hands: 1)
trishUla (trident); 2) khatvA\~Nga (skull-topped brand); 3) shakti
(spear); 4) varada-mudra; 5) abhayamudra; 6) indIvara (lotus); 7) ahi
(snake); 8) Damaru (dumbbell drum); 9) pomegranate; 10) akShasUtra
(rosary). His praise here begins with the ancient pa\~nchAkSharI mantra,
which also has its beginnings in the shatarudrIya of the yajurveda. The
worship of each deity in this stava concludes with the verb vyapoh in
imperative mood applied to pApa, meaning remove the sins of the
worshiper\]

pa\~ncha-mUrtayaH:  
IshAnaH puruShash-chaiva aghoraH sadya eva cha |  
vAmadevash cha bhagavAn pApam Ashu vyapohatu ||

\[The pa\~nchabrahma-s or the five face mantra-s, as a group, come from
the early layer of the shaiva tradition recorded in the late vaidika
period and used by shaiva-s ever since. They are central to the
pAshupata tradition practice and the five sections of the pAshupata
sUtra-s have been identified with these mantra-s. They stand for the
faces of sadAshiva or the rudra repesenting each of the five faces. The
saiddhAntika tradition holds that their tantra-s were narrated by the
upward face or the IshAna face, hence their appellation Urdhavasrotas.
Keeping with this, we have the list here begin with IshAna and then go
around east-south-west-north. This is an interesting departure from the
common brahmabha\~Ngi sequence of the saiddhAntika texts (e.g parAkhya
tantra) of ishAna-tatpuruSha-aghora-vAmadeva-sadyojAta or its reverse
seen in the veda and tantra-s like kiraNa and mR^igendra. In the
saiddhAntika tradition these five faces are shown as IshAna (quartz ),
sadyojAta (conch-white), vAmdeva (red), aghora (black), and tatpuruSha
(yellow). If they are visualized as faces of sadAshiva then that of
IshAna is shown as a boy, that of tatpuruSha as a young man, that of
aghora as a fierce one with a prominent mustache, that of vAmadeva as a
seductive woman, and that of sadyojAta as a great king. If they are
visualized as separate rudra-s then several distinct prescriptions are
given: In the mata\~NgapArameshvara tantra they are visualized with 4
heads and 4 arms during mantra-practice. If idols are made then they
have 4 heads and 8 arms with gems embedded in them. In the Chera
country, the deshika ravi in his prayogama\~njarI recommends visualizing
the 4 directional rudra-s thus – sadyojAta 4 heads, 4 arms; vAmadeva as
a goddess with 4 heads and 4 hands; aghora with 4 heads with fangs and 8
arms; tatpuruSha as yogin with 1 head and 4 arms; Ishana just like
sadAshiva with 5 heads and 10 arms. In the bhairava-srotas (svachChanda
tantra) they are all visualized with 5 heads and 10 arms around
svachChanda-bhairava with 5 heads and 18 hands. The manual from the
Kashmira country by kShemarAja, student of abhinavagupta states that
these rudra-s should be depicted as holding varada, abhaya, a sword,
shield, a lasso, a hook, arrows, a pinAka bow,a severed head and the
khaTvA\~Nga.\]

\[The vidyeshvara-s are rudra-s who represent the apotheosis of the
shaiva mantra-s. In a sense this directly represents a key feature of
the tAntrika mantra-mArga inherited from a stream of the mImAMsa
tradition where there and no extra-natural deities. Rather, the deities
are the mantra-s themselves. Hence, these vidyA-s have been deified as 8
distinct deities, the vidyeshvara-s, who are depicted thus: ananta
(golden); sUkShma (fiery); shivottama (black); ekanetra (bee-colored);
ekarudra (white); trimUrti (grey); shrIkaNTha (red); shikhaNDin (light
pink). In this system they occupy the circuit of the maNDala around the
pa\~nchabrahma-s in the 8 cardinal directions. The vidyeshvara-s are
depicted as 2 armed, 8 armed or 10 armed. The saiddhAntika manual from
Nepal pratiShTha-lakShaNa-sAra-samuchchaya states that the 8 armed
vidyesha-s are shown with 4 heads and if two armed they grip a spear and
a trident in the crooks of their elbows. The commonly preserved readings
appear to drop the names in brackets of ekarudra and shikhaNDin probably
because of the unfamiliarity of the later paurANika transmitters with
the intricacies of saiddhAntika tradition.\]

\[It seems that in the iconography of the earlier saiddhAntika tantra-s
sadAshiva was an ekavIra depicted without the accompanying shakti. But
in the pa\~nchAvarNa stava of aghorashiva we find the shakti very much
in place. However, her visualization is not described there as it seem
the unity of the shakti with sadAshiva is emphasized this way.
Interestingly, in this stava she receives a longer praise than
sadAshiva. This, points to the parallel saiddhAntika stream where she
played a major role, reminiscent of what was seen in the development of
the bhairava- and vAma- srotAMsi. She is praised with her usual epithets
from paurANika legend and also described as the mother of the four fold
kumAra-s starting with naigameya. This rather archaic feature is
reiterated in this text (see below). Moreover, she is also described as
the mother of nandin, gaNesha and the deva-s. She is identified with
prakR^iti and its 23 evolutes as described in the sAMkhya tradition.
This is in opposition to the saiddhAntika situation where 36 tattva-s
are believed to exist. Thus, this seems to represent a paurANika
“smArtization” of the saiddhAntika shaiva position.\]
