The terrifying AshugaruDa is a dinosaurine deity of the AkAsha bhairava
tradition that includes other dinosaurine deities like [pakShirAja
sharabha](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/arimaspas-dinosaurs-griffins-and.html)
and
[AkAshabhairava](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/oldest-archaeological-signs-of-ritual.html).
One of the vidyA-s of this devatA involve the deployment of the
R^igvedic mantras (RV 10.178) in a tantric context and this is known as
the veda mantrokta Ashu-garuDA vidyA.

The sAdhaka invokes AshugaruDa into the yantra with the mantra:

OM shrIM svasti nas-trAkShyo ariShTanemyom ||

Then he performs homa with the following mantras:  
The R^iShi is sha\~Nkara, the Chandas is triShTubh, the devata is ashu
tArkShya.  
tyamU Shu vAjinaM deva jUtaM sahAvAnaM tarutAraM rathAnAm | yaM hUM  
ariShTanemiM pR^itanAjam AshuM svastaye tArkShyam ihA huvema ||

sahasrasAH shatasA asya raMhir nasmA varante yuvatiM na sharyAm ||

Ashu-garuDa is meditated as having a reddish complexion, with a
yellowish face, with a crest with black plumes on the head, reddish
brown eyes, with two horns above the eyes and having sharp talons and
fangs. He is seen as displaying great fury and pervading the universe
with a dreadful blaze emanating from his body like that corresponding to
the end of the kalpa.

The original deity Ashu-garuDa seems to have had his origins in the
ancient garuDa tantra-s of the pUrva srotas and was absorbed by the
siddhAnta tantra-s of the Urdhva srotas in the dadhIchi saMhitA along
with sharabha and AkAsha bhairava.
