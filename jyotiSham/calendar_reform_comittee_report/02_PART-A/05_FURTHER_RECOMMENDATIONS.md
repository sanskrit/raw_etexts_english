(10) Steps should be taken to compile an "Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac" by the Government of India, showing in advance, the positions of the sun, the moon, planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar-both civil and religious prepared according to the above recommendations should be included in that publication every year. 



A permanent Standing Committee to be called the Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac Committee may be constituted for this purpose and attached to a scientific department of the Government of India. 



(11) Steps should be taken to establish a National Astronomical Observatory at a suitable place, provided with modern equipment, apparatus and time-service. 



We hope that the Government of India would make early arrangements for implementation of our recommendations. For this purpose the date 21st March, 1956 A.D., which is Caitra 1, 1878 Saka seems to be the most suitable time for introduction of the reformed calendar throughout India.
