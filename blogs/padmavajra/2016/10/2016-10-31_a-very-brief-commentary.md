So,I found [this article](http://archive.is/DzYyo) by Garga Chatterjee a
year ago,and he reshared this again a few
[days](http://archive.is/aOE6X) ago.



My two cents:



-   Delinking devī from a movement that is meant to protect Hindu
    samāja,no matter how defective it is at its present stage is of no
    sense.
-   It is clear that the author only uses Devī as a prop to write
    against those who are the best wishers of the guard of Hindu society
    against aggressions.
-   It would have been a lot better if She was invoked more frequently
    all over India. The festival is already becoming secularized more
    [day by day](http://archive.is/yu9iy),and not many seem to be
    noticing it yet. Or thought over the loss to Hindu tradition the
    ‘secularization’ can bring about.
