title = "The drinking of soma in svarga"

+++
Briefly we were awarded the freedom by the grace of the great indra, who
is greater than all (vishvasmAd indra uttaraH). We scored two great
victories against the dasyus and brought back booty even as our empire
was under fierce assaults. Verily indra bore us aid as we locked in
combat with two dasyus and we overthrew them after the vajra entered our
weapons and shattered theirs. We also made a strong thrust against the
third front to bring the fort within striking distance. The spear of
skanda relieved us from the pUtanA grAhi and we were placed in the midst
of our rejoicing bands. We quaffed soma effused with thickened sweet
milk, ate choice spreads and delighted in svarga as dyutAna in the days
of yore. But we were told, like for yayAti, the elevation to svargo
lokaH was not a permanent feature and we could be sent back to the midst
of the rAkshasIs anytime. But then all have stated that one should enjoy
svarga when you can. We looked forward to the performance of the great
dhUrta kalpa with the 6th day of the moon to please the senAni.

We were asked to consider two things: 1) For the past 5 days before
today swarms of crows filled the trees in our vicinity at might and
swirled around making an enormous racket. 2) We were asked to meditate
upon the killing of the demon, the giant bhImaratha by viShNu.
