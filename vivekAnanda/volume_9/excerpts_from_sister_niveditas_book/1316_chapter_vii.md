## CHAPTER VII

LIFE AT SRINAGAR

PLACE: Srinagar.

TIME: June 22 to July 15, 1898.

In the mornings we still had long talks as before — some-times it would
be the different religious periods through which Kashmir had passed, or
the morality of Buddhism, or the history of Shiva-worship, or perhaps
the position of Srinagar under Kanishka.

Once he was talking with one of us about Buddhism, and he suddenly said,
"The fact is, Buddhism tried to do, in the time of Ashoka, what the
world never was ready for till now!" He referred to the federalization
of religions. It was a wonderful picture, this, of the religious
imperialism of Ashoka, broken down time and again by successive waves of
Christianity and Mohammedanism, each claiming exclusive rights over the
conscience of mankind and finally to seem to have a possibility, within
measurable distance of time, today!

Another time the talk was of Genghis, or Chenghis, Khan, the conqueror
from Central Asia. "You hear people talk of him as a vulgar aggressor",
he cried passionately, "but that is not true! They are never greedy or
vulgar, these great souls! He was inspired with the thought of unity,
and he wanted to unify his world. Yes, Napoleon was cast in the same
mould. And another, Alexander. Only those three, or perhaps one soul
manifesting itself in three different conquests!" And then he passed on
to speak of that one soul whom he believed to have come again and again
in religion, charged with the divine impulse to bring about the unity of
man in God.

At this time the transfer of the *Prabuddha Bharata* from Madras to the
newly established Ashrama at Mayavati was much in all our thoughts. The
Swami had always had a special love for this paper, as the beautiful
name he had given it indicated. He had always been eager too for the
establishment of organs of his own. The value of the journal in the
education of modern India was perfectly evident to him, and he felt that
his master's message and mode of thought required to be spread by this
means as well as by preaching and by work. Day after day, therefore, he
would dream about the future of his papers, as about the work in its
various centres. Day after day he would talk of the forthcoming first
number under the new editorship of Swami Swarupananda. And one afternoon
he brought to us, as we sat together, a paper on which he said he had
"tried to write a letter, but it would come this way!" . . . \[*Vide*

JUNE 26.

The Master was longing to leave us all and go away into some place of
quiet, alone. But we, not knowing this, insisted on accompanying him to
the Coloured Springs, called "Kshir Bhavâni", or "Milk of the Mother".
It was said to be the first time that Christian or Mohammedan had ever
landed there, and we can never be thankful enough for the glimpse we had
of it since afterwards it was to become the most sacred of all names to
us. . . .

JUNE 29.

Another day we went off quietly by ourselves and visited the
Takt-i-Suleiman, a little temple very massively built on the summit of a
small mountain two or three thousand feet high. It was peaceful and
beautiful, and the famous Floating Gardens could be seen below us for
miles around. The Takt-i-Suleiman was one of the great illustrations of
the Swami's argument when he would take up the subject of the Hindu love
of nature as shown in the choice of sites for temples and architectural
monuments. As he had declared, in London, that the saints lived on the
hill-tops in order to enjoy the scenery, so now he pointed out — citing
one example after another — that our Indian people always consecrated
places of peculiar beauty and importance by making there their altars of
worship. And there was no denying that the little Takt, crowning the
hill that dominated the whole valley, was a case in point.

Many lovely fragments of those days come into mind, as:

Therefore, Tulasi, take thou care to live with  
all, for who can tell where, or in what garb,  
the Lord Himself may next come to thee?  
One God is hidden in all these, the Torturer  
of all, the Awakener of all, the Reservoir  
of all being, the One who is bereft of all  
qualities.  
There the sun does not shine, nor the moon,  
nor the stars.

There was the story of how Râvana was advised to take the form of Râma
in order to cheat Sitâ. He answered, "Have I not thought of it? But in
order to take a man's form you must meditate on him; and Rama is the
Lord Himself; so when I meditate on him, even the position of Brahmâ
becomes a mere straw. How, then, could I think of a woman?"

"And so", commented the Swami, "even in the commonest or most criminal
life, there are these glimpses". It was ever thus. He was constantly
interpreting human life as the expression of God, never insisting on the
heinousness or wickedness of the act or a character.

"In that which is dark night to the rest of the world, there the man of
self-control is awake. That which is life to the rest of the world is
sleep to him."

Speaking of Thomas à Kempis one day, and of how he himself used to
wander as a Sannyâsin with the Gitâ and the *Imitation* as his whole
library, one word, he said, came back to him, inseparably associated
with the name of the Western monk:

Silence! ye teachers of the world, and silence!  
ye prophets! Speak Thou alone, O Lord, unto my soul!

Again:

The soft Shirisha flower can bear the weight of  
humming bees, but not of birds —  
So Umâ, don't you go and make Tapasyâ!  
Come, Uma, come! delight and idol of my soul!  
Be seated, Mother, on the lotus of my heart,  
And let me take a long, long look at you.  
From my birth up, I am gazing,  
Mother, at your face —  
Know you suffering what trouble,  
and pain?  
Be seated, therefore, Blessed One,  
on the lotus of my heart,  
And dwell there for evermore.

Every now and then there would be long talks about the Gita — "that
wonderful poem, without one note in it of weakness or unmanliness." He
said one day that it was absurd to complain that knowledge was not given
to women or to Shudras. For the whole gist of the Upanishads was
contained in the Gita. Without it, indeed, they could hardly be
understood; and women and all castes could read the Mahâbhârata.

JULY 4.

With great fun and secrecy the Swami and his one non-American disciple
prepared to celebrate the Fourth of July. A regret had been expressed in
his hearing that we had no American flag with which to welcome the other
members of the party to breakfast on their national festival; and late
on the afternoon of the third, he brought a Pundit Durzey \[Brahmin
tailor\] in great excitement, explaining that this man would be glad to
imitate it if he were told how. The stars and stripes were very crudely
represented, I fear, on the piece of cotton that was nailed with
branches of evergreens to the head of the dining—room—boat when the
Americans stepped on board for early tea on Independence Day! But the
Swami had postponed a journey in order to be present at the little
festival, and he himself contributed a poem to the addresses that were
now read aloud by way of greeting. . . . \[*Vide* ["To the Fourth of
July"](../../volume_5/writings_prose_and_poems/to_the_fourth_of_july.htm),

JULY 5.

That evening someone pained him by counting the cherry-stones left on
her plate, to see when she would be married. He somehow took the play in
earnest and came the following morning surcharged with passion for the
ideal renunciation.

JULY 6.

"These shadows of home and marriage cross even *my* mind now and then!"
he cried, with that tender desire to make himself one with the sinner
that he so often showed. But it was across oceans of scorn for those who
would glorify the householder that he sought on this occasion to preach
the religious life. "Is it so easy", he exclaimed, "to be Janaka? To sit
on a throne absolutely unattached? Caring nothing for wealth or fame,
for wife or child? One after another in the West has told me that he had
reached this. But I could only say, 'Such great men are not born in
India'!"

And then he turned to the other side.

"Never forget", he said to one of his hearers, "to say to yourself, and
to teach to your children: as is the difference between a firefly and
the blazing sun, between the infinite ocean and a little pond, between a
mustard-seed and the mountain of Meru, such is the difference between
the householder and the Sannyasin!"

"Everything is fraught with fear: Renunciation alone is fearless."

"Blessed be even the fraudulent Sâdhus, and those who have failed to
carry out their vows, inasmuch as they also have witnessed to the ideal
and so are in some degree the cause of the success of others!"

"Let us never, never, forget our ideal!"

At such moments he would identify himself entirely with the thought he
sought to demonstrate, and in the same sense in which a law of nature
might be deemed cruel or arrogant, his exposition might have those
qualities. Sitting and listening, we felt ourselves brought face to face
with the invisible and absolute.

All this was on our return to Srinagar from the real Fourth of July
celebration, which had been a visit to Dahl Lake. . . .

At nine o'clock on the evening of the following Sunday, July the 10th,
the first two \[Dhira Mata and Jaya\] came back unexpectedly, and
presently, from many different sources, we gathered the news that the
Master had gone to Amarnath by the Sonamarg route and would return
another way. He had started out penniless, but that could give no
concern to his friends, in a Hindu native state. . . .

JULY 15.

What were we setting out for? We were just moving to go down the river
on Friday, and it was close on five in the afternoon when the servants
recognized some of their friends in the distance, and word was brought
that the Swami's boat was coming towards us.

An hour later he was with us, saying how pleasant it was to be back. The
summer had been unusually hot and certain glaciers had given way,
rendering the Sonamarg route to Amarnath impracticable. This fact had
caused his return.

But from this moment dated the first of three great increments of joy
and realization that we saw in him during our months in Kashmir. It was
almost as if we could verify for ourselves the truth of that saying of
his Guru: "There is indeed a certain ignorance. It has been placed there
by my Holy Mother that her work may be done. But it is only like a film
of tissue paper. It might be rent at any moment".
