## CCIV

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR,  
DIST. HOWRAH, BENGAL,

*25th September 1901*.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

I could not write you last mail, excusez \[excuse\]. But I have been
expecting one from you for a long time. Hope one will come this mail.

I am just thinking of going over to Japan, as Miss \[Josephine\] MacLeod
is so insistent. Perhaps something will be done; who knows?

From Japan, of course, a peep into America seems inevitable.

Not much news of Mrs. \[Ole\] Bull or Margot \[Sister Nivedita\]. Margot
is rested, well, and strong. She will come to India some day, perhaps. I
am soon expecting Mrs. \[Charlotte\] Sevier though. Her work is needing
her. Her beautiful home in the Himalayan forests is a temptation,
especially now when a huge tiger is roaming in her compound and killed a
horse, a buffalo, and her pair of mastiffs in broad daylight; a number
of bears \[are\] playing havoc with her vegetable garden; and lots of
porcupines \[are\] doing mischief everywhere!!! She went out of the way
to buy land in a forest — she and her husband liked it so much.

There is not much to write this week. Words only tire one, except one
which is inexhaustible, infinite.

So, goodbye till next week.

Ever with love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA.

PS — Just now comes a telegram from Miss MacLeod and a letter also. She
is so insistent that I am thinking of going over to Japan. In that case,
we cross over to America this winter, and thence to England.

Yours,  
V.
