This manner of the calendar reform exactly fits in with the work on Dharmaśāstra. We have only to understand the words Caitra etc. and Aśvini etc. to be equivalent to Sāyana Caitra etc. and Sayana Aśvini etc. These, the people will find given in our calendar. Thus the present works on Dharmaśāstra even without any change will continue to serve our purpose for all time to come. Any other way of reforming the calendar will require the changes in the works on Dharmaśāstra themselves and we have no power to do the same because the people do suppose that we have no qualifications sufficient to change the Dharmaśāstras but we can suggest the new and the rational interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras as given above 



The real problem before us is to stop the moving back of the seasons through the months Caitra, Vaisakha etc., in such a manner that will fit in with the present Dharmaśāstra. We can only give a new interpretation or meaning to the words Caitra, Vaisākha etc., and Aśvini, Bharani etc., used in the Dharmaśāstras. From this stand point our resolutions in our first meeting still stand unimpeached. I shall now explain what I say. 



To stop the moving back of the seasons through the months Caitra etc. we must make the months move back with equal motion. That means that the months must correspond to or be pegged on the seasonal year and not on the sidereal year as at present. Therefore our resolutions to adopt the seasonal year for the pancānga is quite correct. All corollaries of this proposition must be correct and must be accepted. The corollary is that as at the time of Caitri Purnimā the moon will not be near the fixed star Citrā and similarly in Visakhā etc., the places where the moon will be under such circumstances must be given some other names and we should name them Sāyana Citra, Sāyana Viśākhā etc. We adopt these names being convinced that when the Dharmaśāstras name Castra, Vaiśākha etc., and Aśvini, Bharami etc., they really mean Sāyana Caitra, Sāyana Vaisakha etc, and Sayana Aścini, Sayana Bharani etc. The works on Dharma śāstras came into existence before the precession of equinoxes was discovered. The astronomical works written before Muñjāla, had no idea of the precession of equinoxes. At that time the writers on Dharma śāstra and astronomy thought that the seasonal year and the sidereal year were the same and as they had to regulate the religious functions according to the seasons they must have meant by Caitra, Vaisakha etc., the Sāyana Caitra, Sayana Vaiśākha and by Aśvini, Bharani etc., the Sāyana Aśvini, the Sayana Bharani etc. That the Dharmaśāstra and the Vedas regard only the seasonal year as the year, is clear from the statement in the Satapatha Brāhmana "44 Sht: Fagfaf 4[at: wala NGHI” (The seasons is the year. The year can stand only by the help of the seasons). In view of this statement it is clear that we will do real justice to the Dharmaśāstras if we understand by Caitra etc. the Sāyano: Caitra and by Aśvini etc. the Sayana Aśvini . etc. If we do not approve of the adjective Sāyana we may apply the adjective 'Cala' which is more expressive. We have to accept this interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras as the corollary of our proposition that we must accept the seasonal year for our calendar. 



Now I shall consider the objections raised by the Pañcānga Sodhana Pariṣad of Calcutta. The objections are stated in the following sentences. “Our religious festivals and observances were observed during all this period and no difficulty was experienced in any time. We are confident that in future also we shall experience no difficulty by this gradual shifting of the V. E. point. For this purpose if any attempt is made artificially to stop further receding back of the equinoxes, as appears to have been proposed by the Calendar Reform Committee, it will no doubt be completely opposed to our sastric tradition as well as to science". 



e V. E. Door to stop ve been 



in no doub 



This discloses complete ignorance of the history of our calendar system. In the beginning when our ancestors found that the V. E. had shifted back they changed the beginning of the year from one nakṣatra to another behind it, for example, they changed the beginning of the year from Myga to Rohini, from Rohini to Krttékā, from Krttikā to Dhaniṣthā, from Dhaniṣthā to Śravana and from Sravana again to Aśvini. These changes required corresponding changes in the Dharmaśāstras also. These were the times when the Dharmaśāstra had not become stationary as it has become at present. Our ancestors, therefore, could make necessary changes in Dharmaśāstra also. It was therefore that our ancestors, as the memorandum says, found no difficulty in observing the religious festivals. But now we actually find the difficulty because Dharmaśāstra has become stationary. Take the case of Vaiśākha Buddha Trtiyā or Akṣaya Trtiyā. In this festival we have to offer to a Brāhman an earthen pot for cooling drinking water. At present we get very hot summer on Akṣaya Trtiya and there fore the ceremony is the proper one at that time. In REPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITTEE 



19: 



future however, we shall have rainy season on Vaisakha Suddha Tyttyā after about 2000 years. Will this ceremony be proper at that time? We shall have to perform it at least on Caitra Suddha. Totīyā. This shows that if we stick to the sidereal year we shall then have to change the Dharmaśāstra from time to time. Are the objectors willing to accept such a position? They do not appear to be, because they are staunch followers of the Sastras and they want to follow them literally. The late S. B. Dixit has cited in his famous book some other examples like that of Akṣaya Trtiya (see pages 420 to 423), and in fact, we are very unwilling to perform our present functions in any season other than that in which we are at present performing them. The Sastras also as shown above really regard the round of the seasons as the year. It is because our śāstras regarded the seasons as equivalent to the year, and that our ancestors shifted several times, the beginning of the year from one nakṣatra to another, and they added intercalary months from time to time. Are we even now to follow this crude method of adjusting the year to the seasons or to adopt a more scientific method of gradually changing the beginning of the zodiac in conformity with the actual movements in the heaven? 



It is objected that the śāstras do not require all religious functions to be observed in the seasonal months. The objectors give example of Jonmāṣtami and say that we need not bother whether it is in rainy season or not. This is not true. We all suppose that the Lord Krṣna was born in rainy season and that he was taken from Mathura to Gokul through the flooded Yamuna. We would not like his birth day to be celebrated in the cold seasons. Though the Sastras require Rohini Nakṣatra on the birth day of the Lord Krṣna, we would rather accept his birth day in the rainy season with Sāyana or Cala Rohini on that day. Similarly about Vaiśākhi Purnima, Śrāvani Purnimā, Maghi Purnimā, Sarasvati Pūjā, mentioned in the memorandum, we do like to celebrate them in the seasons in which they are at present being celebrated and on days on which we shall have Sāyana or Cala Viśākhā, Sravana, Maghā, etc. nakṣatras. By adopting Sāyana or Cala nakṣatras, we will avoid the necessity of two systems, one sidereal and other tropical. suggested by the objectors and which will be too confusing to the public. The adoption of two systems will give rise to difficulties in Dharmaśāstra. It will give rise to questions about the system according to which particular ceremonies are to be performed, and different pandits will give different solutions to these questions. Thus there will be all confusion. On the contrary by adopting Sāyana or Cala nakṣatra for all ceremonies and Sayana months, we avoid all confusion and create certainty. 



The evidence in favour of seasonal months is so strong that the objectors make the following statement in favour of them. “In early Vedic times the sacrifices were performed in seasonal months. So all the Vedic festivals should no doubt be observed in the seasonal months.” But the objectors say, "But we do not agree that all other festivals which developed after the Vedic period, are required to be observed in the seasonal months." This objection cannot stand because there is no ground to suppose that the Dharmaśāstra with the object of making a change accepted the sidereal year in place of the seasonal year. 



It may be said that the names Caitra, Vaisakha etc. prove that the Dharmaśāstras accepted the sidereal year in place of the seasonal year. But this reasoning is refuted by the fact that they changed the beginning of the year from one nakṣatra to another to keep agreement with the seasons. Therefore the conclusion is that even the names Caitra, Vaiśākha etc. in Dharmaśāstra implied particular seasons. Here I will cite the authority of the famous work Dharmasindhu which plans to give decisions without citing authority. 



The work says, TATTW #TATUTATHATTI got of 771:1 Herre a faiforegrafia fetare : 1 amatet arrest 



सारणं प्रशस्तम्। 



Translation : Every two months from Caitra constitute lunar seasons beginning from Vasanta. However when there is intercalary month the lunar season consists of something less than 90 days. It is proper to mention the lunar season in all the ceremonies ordained by fa and afa. 



This means that whenever there is the word Caitra it implies the season Vasanta. This was no doubt the condition when the name Caitrādi first came into existence. But now Caitra comes in hot season (th). The late S. B. Dixit' also says : 



"चैववैशाख है वसंताचे मास हो परिभाषा सर्व पन्थात दिसून येते. ती स्थापित झाल्यावर पुष्कल कालामें ऋत्वारंभ मागें पाला, म्हणून काही ग्रन्थात मौन मेष है मास म्हणजे फाल्गुन-चैत्र में मास वसंताचे अशी परिभाषा पाली. व तीप्रमाणे कांहीं पञ्चांगात हल्ली ऋतु लिहितात. सांप्रत माघ-फाल्गुनांत वसंत होतो. तरी देखील चैत्र-वैशाख वसंत ऋतु ह्या परिभाषेचे प्रावल्य आहेच." 



Translation: The technical language that Caitra and Vaiśākha are the months of Vasanta is found in all works. Long time after it was established, the beginning of the seasons receded back. Therefore in some works we find the technical language that the Mina and Meṣa i.e. phālguna and Caitra are the months of Vasanta, and in some pañcāngas seasons are written according to that. At present Vasanta comes in the months of Magha and Phalguna. Even then the technical language that Caitra and Vaiśākha is Vasanta predominates,

All this shows that even when the names Castra, Vaiśākha etc. were used they meant a particular season also and that the season implied. has been changing. The resolutions of our Committee in our first meeting amount to this that Caitra and Vaiśākha hereafter shall always mean the Griṣma (hot season) etc. The memorandum of the objectors says that in the Dharmaśāstra seasons or seasonal months are not mentioned. To this my reply is as follows : 



In the Dharmaśāstra that enjoins the particular ceremony there may be no mention of seasons or Seasonal months. But the names of the months Caitra, Vaiśākha etc. are always there, and the names of the months implies particular season as shown above. Therefore the words Phalguna and Caitra in Dharma śāstra always imply the Vasanta season and Vaisakha always implies the hot seasons. This is the interpreta- . tion that we have to give to these names. By these names they always meant the particular seasons. We can give effect to the real meaning of these names only by supposing that Caitra means Sāyana Caitra, Vaiśākha means Sāyana Vaiśākha etc. 



I have already suggested above that it is confusing to accept the seasonal year for some ceremony and sidereal year for other. It is better to hold that even the words Caitra, Vaiśākha etc. imply the particular seasons and to take the seasonal year and seasonal months for all ceremonies. 



The memorandum raises objections on the grounds of the scientific terminology, Indian tradition and lexicography. This ground vanishes if we say that our names are really Sāyana Caitra, Sāyana Vaiśākha and Sāyana or Cala Aśvini, Sāyana or Cala Bharani, 



etc., and if we say that these names express the real meaning of Caitra, etc. and Aśvini etc. used in 



Dharmaśāstras. 



India is the country of blind orthodoxy. Whenever any improvement is proposed the people suppose that they will be drowned in the torrent of improvements, and they oppose the improvement blindly. Any person who wants to introduce the improvement has to be firm and should not give way to such resistance. Signatories of the memorandum are persons who would resist any improvement. Now they would resist the improvement in the calendar and if they become successful they would then resist the necessary improvements in the Dharmaśāstra also. We should not take account of such people and we should take care that we make no abrupt change that would disturb the passions of the people. It is therefore that we have resolved that we should accept 23° 15' ayanārśa instead of 0° ayanāṁśa as proposed by some enthusiastic reformers. By this I refer to the memo randum submitted by Yeshwant Pradhan, Krishnaram Valgi Bhat and Dattatraya K. Sule who have proposed that we should take 0° as ayanāṁśa. 



In conclusion I submit that we have rightly chosen in our first meeting not to make any changes in the works of Dharmaśāstra but to give them correct inter pretation and to make such changes in the calendar as will suit the calendar to that correct interpretation of the Dharmaśāstras. But unfortunately this decision has not been adhered to fully. Nirayana nakṣatras have been accepted for the calendar. This makes a change in the Dharmaśāstra necessary. Therefore now I suggest the alternative course suggested in my dissenting note.
