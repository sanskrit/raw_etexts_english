title = "nIlarudra sUkta (upaniShat)"

+++
nIlarudra is part of the AV-paippalAda saMhitA (sUkta 3 of kANDa 14). It
is also considered an upaniShad of the early pAshupata-s equivalent to
the shvetAshvatara of the kR^iShNa yajurveda. In the now lost shrauta
traditions of the atharvaN-s the brahmA recited the sUkta mentally,
standing beside the yajamAna, when the fifth layer of the altar for the
soma ritual was completed. In the much later tAntrika tradition it is
held that the bhArgava transmission of the jayA-tantra and
unmatta-bhairava sUtra-s of the vAma srotas are emanations of the core
nIlarudra mantra-s. In atharvaNa vidhAna prayoga, nIlarudra can be
combined with the rudra mantra-s of the uchChuShma kalpa for each of the
viniyoga-s. A person who is not of the bhArgava clan, or uninitiated
into the atharvaNa shruti needs to undergo a second atharvanic upanayana
to perform prayoga-s with these mantra-s. However, if one desires to
study it as an upaniShad as part of his shaiva study he may do so as is.

To my knowledge the published versions of the paippalAda text and the
nIlarudra lack svara-s. An Orissan recitation prepared during a
veda-pArAyaNa organized by the kumbhaghoNaM (aka kA\~Nchi) maTha of the
sha\~Nkara tradition also lacked svara-s and had peculiarities of the
eastern dialect. The published versions which we have seen also have
certain inaccuracies. Hence, as part of our preservation of atharvavedic
material we prepared a version with accents and its supporting
recitation. The udAtta-s are marked in red and the rest of the svara-s
use the usual AV notation deployed in the transmission of the vulgate AV
text (not the Kashmirian paippalAda). At some later time we might
attempt to discuss some interesting aspect of vedic (and early IE)
accents that come up as result of the study of this text.
