There are some interesting elements in the apabhraMsha dohA-s of saraha
discovered by Haraprasada Shastri and Rahula Samkrityayana. These add to
the enormously paradoxical nature of the dohA-kosha of saraha, again
pointing to the enormous debt of the tAthAgata-s to the kaula systems
emerging among the shaiva-s. Let us look at the following:  
akkhara-vaNNo parama-guNa-rahio  
bhaNai Na jANai e mai kahiao |  
so paramesaru kAsu kahijjai  
suraa kumArI jima paDivajjai ||

Bereft of sound, color, or the fundamental guNa-s, it cannot be spoken
about or known, so I (i.e. saraha) say.  
How can the parameshvara be described? Like a girl’s first experience of
an orgasm.

Two terms are of note here: 1) This dohA has a rather shaiva ring to it.
It goes rather against all primary bauddha concepts to consider the
entity beyond the guNa-s who cannot be described or known to be
parameshvara. However, this parameshvara can be interpreted within the
bauddha framework of a yogin, such as saraha, as representing a heruka
deity such as buddhakapAla, hevajra or the chakrasaMvara. But the
specific term parameshvara clearly indicates that this doha was acquired
without much or any modification from a shaiva source. From iconographic
and hagiographic sources its clear that sarahapAda, the euphemistic
mahAbrAhmaNa, took on the emblems of the kApAlika type. We also know
that the bauddha yogin-s frequented the same great shmashAna-s and
pITha-s as those used by the shaiva practitioners of the pAshupata mata,
the bhairava srotas, the kula-prakriyA. It was probably in such
kShetra-s, the bauddha yogin-s acquired doha-s, along with elements of
the charyAgIti-s composed by kaula nAtha-s (e.g. the doha-s of the kaula
nAtha-s collected by H.P. Dwivedi). 2) The sexual allegory used in doha
is suggestive of the performance of maithuna as per the shaiva kaula
ritual. In the kaula ritual the pleasurable activities are aimed at
satiating the deities residing in the organs with the ultimately
non-dual consciousness being experienced via maithuna, where yogin and
the dUtI’s consciousness are one.

Nau aNu Nau paramANu vichintaje  
aNavara a bhAvahi phurai surattaje |  
bhaNai saraha bhanti eta vimattaje

Don’t think it’s the atoms or the fundamental particles; it is the
unending orgiastic delight that pervades existence.  
saraha says that such \[i.e. atomic\] false thinking is madness; arrey
\! low-born one understand the ultimate reality.

The alliterative effects of saraha are at high point in this dohA. A
point of interest is his attack on atomism, which in some ways resembles
the attack on atomism by the advaita vedAntin-s. Who are the atomists he
is attacking? The atomic ideas could come from nyAya, vaisheShika or
even sAMkhya, but the view the particles are fundamental is central to
the former two. Given the evidence that shaiva-s, especially those of
the atimArga (e.g. the
[kAlAmukha](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/23/kalamukhas-ii/))
and to a degree the
[saiddhAntika-s](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/08/02/a-pashupata-inscription-and-some-thought-on-the-history-of-nyaya-vaisheshika/)
were followers of the atomic doctrine, we suspect that this attack is
directed towards their theories of existence.

paNDia saala sattha vakkhANai  
dehahiM buddha vasanta na jANai |  
avaNAgamana Na teNa vikhaNDia  
tovi Nilajja bhaNai hauM paNDia ||  
The pundit expounds the entire shAstra not knowing that the buddha
dwells within his body.  
\[The cycles of \] coming and going are not shattered by that means but
he shamelessly says: “I am a pundit”.

This is not an attack on the Astika brAhmaNa paNDita-s but his own
fellow nAstika paNDita-s who taught at the centers like nAlandA and
varendrI. In some ways this is reminiscent of a text termed the bhaja
govindaM composed by the shaMkarAdvaitin-s of south India influenced by
the dattAtreyan ascetic tradition. There the paNinian rules are
condemned. The bhaja govindaM is wrongly attributed to AdishaMkara, who
unlike the spirit expressed in the text strongly emphasized scholarly
tradition. The anti-scholastic tendencies rose among the siddha-s’
compositions (like that of sarahapAda) and diffused among the various
ascetic groups before eventually even infecting the medieval
shaMkarAdvaita tradition – however, unlike saraha they expressed their
anti-scholastic thoughts in elegant Sanskrit.Importantly, the very
survival of these doha-s was due their incorporation into the scholarly
tradition of the nAstika-s – the doha-s of saraha are preserved as a
part of a Sanskrit commentarial tradition represented by the
dohA-kosha-pa\~njikA. We also know that saraha himself contributed to
the scholastic tradition via his commentaries on the yoginI tantra-s
such as the buddhakapala tantraM. This is in line with the tAntrika work
of other dohA composers, like kR^iShNAcharya’s commentary on the hevajra
tantra. This raises the question as to what is the relationship between
the tantra commentators and the dohA composers – have they been
synonymized even as shaMkara was made the author of the bhaja govindaM
and the tAntrika texts like the saundaryalaharI or the prapa\~nchasAra?
The case of the nAstika AchArya-s appears to be very different from that
of the vedAntAchArya – the former do really belong inside the nAstika
yoginI tantra tradition. The anti-scholasticism of these AchArya-s
appears to reflect their expression after the attainment of the sahaja
state in which the other devices seem empty.

Avanta Na dIssai janta Nahi achChanta Na muNiai |  
Nittara\~Nga paramesuru Nikkala\~Nka dhAhijjai ||  
You don’t see it coming nor going, you don’t know it when it is there;  
parameshvara is without waves, blemishless and \[as though\] washed
clean.

This is dohA is notable again because of its use of the shaiva term
parameshvara as in the one mentioned above. The interesting point here
is the use of the term “Nittara\~Nga”, i.e. without waves – this might
be considered along side the idea expressed in the shaiva kaula systems
that the body of shiva (the parameshvara) is the “sky of consciousness”
in which like in the ocean the universe emerges and ends through the
conjunction and disjunction of waves which are the shakti-s (this is
clearly expounded in the virUpAkSha pa\~nchAshika). This dohA instead
seems to insist on the converse trying to present the parameshvara as
being free from such waves.

Avai jAi Na chChaDDai tAvahu |  
kahiM apuvvA vilAsiNi pAvahu ||  
If you do not renounce the coming and going how can you attain the
incomparable vilAsinI ?

This verse is particular interesting because it mentions the attainment
of vilAsinI. We suspect that this is not just a casual name for the
yoginI attained upon renunciation of the saMsAra cycle, but is likely to
represent a specific reference to the erotic kaula deity
[vilAsinI](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/upasana-of-the-1112-vilasini-s/).
The vilAsinI-kula system is closely shared by both the Astika-s and
nAstika-s. In the nAstika world we encounter the goddess in the
vajra-vilAsinI-stotra of the Acharya vibhUtichandra who extensively
transmitted his tAntrika lore to the Tibetans after the destruction of
the Indian universities by the Moslems. The tAthAgata-s have also
incorporated the worship of vilAsinI taught by the early kaula siddha
shabara in a vajrified form in the guhya-vajra-vilAsinI sAdhana.
