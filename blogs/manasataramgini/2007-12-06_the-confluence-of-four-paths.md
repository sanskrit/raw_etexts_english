The vaiShNava during his perambulations in Central Asia had noted two
texts with collection of Mongol “mantra-s”:  
1\) iruegel maghataghal : a collection of ritual formulae and hymns.  
2)Altan erike by Arya paNDita who lived among the Khalkha branch of the
Mongols.

In course of their study he uncovered a deity named guejir kuengker
tengri, whom he brought to my attention. This deity was described as the
deity who provides fodder for herds and also food for men. The Mongolian
scholars Heissig, Poppe (“Zum Feuerkultus bei den Mongolen” and
“Mongolische Volksdichtung mit deutscher Ubersetzung”) and Partanen
(“A description of Buriat Shamanism”) have all noted this deity appear
also under the name maqa galan Darqan Guejir tengri as the special deity
of horned cattle. A remarkable hymn composed to the deity has survived
in the Mongol ritual collection:

*Great maqA gAlan Darqan Guejir tengri,*  
*Eldest brother of the ninety-nine tengri,*  
*Who arose through the blessing of Qormusta Tengri,*  
*At the command of the holy teacher Buddha,*  
*You who have a glorious cast-iron shield,*  
*you who have a beautiful colored throne,*  
*you who have a great golden hammer,*  
*you who have a great silver anvil,*  
*you maqA gAlan Darqan Guejir tengri, I worship,*  
*Deign to come here on your blue-grey horse,*  
*you who determines all things,*  
*Deign to come here on your black horse,*  
*For the sake of my child’s life and spirit,*  
*For the sake of life and spirit of the four kinds of livestock,*  
*That live in the steppe, I ask you.*

What is remarkable here is that one sees 4 religious layers:  
1\) The Iranian Zarathushtrian cult of Ahura-Mazdha is the basis for the
deity named Qormusta Tengri.  
2\) Darqan Guejir tengri himself is an archetypal Altaic deity of the
steppes, a smith god, who wielded a hammer and an anvil. He appears to
have been the patron deity of Jelme, one of the great generals of
Chingiz Kha’khan  
3\) He is identified as maqA gAlan which is the Hindu element in the
mix: mahakAla, who as the archetypal rudra-pashupati is a bucolic
lord.  
4\) There is the nAstIka element seen in the form of the holy teacher
buddha who is placed in a supreme position under the Lamaistic
influence.

As we have discussed
[before](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/10/23/the-fire-hymns-of-the-mongols/),
the early interaction between the Iranian tribes on the steppes with the
Mongols was critical for the rise of the latter. It was during this
process the first amalgamation of the cult of Ahura Mazda and the Altaic
religion took place. It probably began during the first great Hun
Khaganate when its founder Motun Tegin was a hostage of the Iranian
tribe of the Kushanas. Subsequently the Hepthalite Huns were a part of
the confederation of second great Hun Khaganate of the Juan-Juan. One
Hepthalite Hun coin from Afghanistan shows a fire altar with Ahura
Mazdha. These two Hun Khaghanates were recognized as the precursors of
the Chingizid Mongols, suggesting that the Iranian influence of the
Ahura Mazda cult was an early element.
