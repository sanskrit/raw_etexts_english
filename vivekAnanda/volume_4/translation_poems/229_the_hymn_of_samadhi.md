## THE HYMN OF SAMADHI

(*Rendered from [Bengali](6208.pdf)* )

Lo! The sun is not, nor the comely moon,  
All light extinct; in the great void of space  
Floats shadow-like the image-universe.

In the void of mind involute, there floats  
The fleeting universe, rises and floats,  
Sinks again, ceaseless, in the current "I".

Slowly, slowly, the shadow-multitude  
Entered the primal womb, and flowed ceaseless,  
The only current, the "I am", "I am".

Lo! 'Tis stopped, ev'n that current flows no more,  
Void merged into void — beyond speech and mind!  
Whose heart understands, he verily does.
