Rajarshi Nandy:

> The Chandogya Upanishad mentions this incident. The boy came to
> Gauthama  
> Rishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked him for his gotra. The boy
> goes back  
> to his mother and finds out that his mother is not aware of who the
> father  
> was. The boy comes back and says the same to Rishi Guathama, who says
> that  
> he shall teach the boy as the boy belongs to the gotra of truth, and
> thus by  
> default is a Brahmana.
>
> “Thereupon the boy went to Gautama and asked to be accepted as a
> student.  
> ‘Of what family are you, my lad?’ inquired the sage. Satyakama
> replied: ‘I  
> asked my mother what my family name was, and she answered: “I do not
> know.  
> In my youth I was a servant and worked in many places. I do not know
> who was  
> your father. I am Jabala, and you are Satyakama. Call yourself
> Satyakama  
> Jabala!” I am therefore Satyakama Jabala, sir.’ Then said the sage:
> ‘None  
> but a true Brahmin would have spoken thus. Go and fetch fuel, for I
> will  
> teach you. You have not swerved from the truth.'” (Chandogya
> Upanishad  
> 4:4:3,4)
>
> So that is one sure shot, explicit case, where a Rishi shows that the
> tag  
> Brahmin is more by action than by birth.

Ajit Krishnan:

> This is a popular misconception. Satyakama asks his mother this  
> question upfront. The mother does not know her child’s gotra. Why?
> In  
> olden days, women married young, and did not ask questions such as  
> “Who are you? What is your gotra?” to their husband. (In some areas,  
> this is still taboo today.) Over time, the gotra would be repeated  
> during various samskara’s, she would naturally remember it. The  
> conclusion here is that her husband, whom she served with devotion,  
> died young.
>
> The seers were tri-kAla-darshi-s. Gautama knew of his boy’s pedigree  
> before asking him the question. After hearing his answer, he says “A  
> non-brahmin could not have said this . . . you have not swerved from  
> the truth”. “satyam” is explained as “brAhmaNa-jAti-dharma”.
>
> First, you have a jAti-brAhmaNa who desires to go to a preceptor, on  
> his own, during childhood. He then answers the preceptor’s question  
> truthfully, in his mother’s own words, without embellishment. This
> is  
> a very rare set of events. Of course the acharyA sees the worthy  
> student in front of him.

Rajarshi Nandy:

> I do not agree to this analysis of the incident.

Ajit Krishnan:
