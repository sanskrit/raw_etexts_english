GHAZIPUR,  
*14th Feb*.*,1890*.

MY DEAR GUPTA (Swami Sadananda),

I hope you are doing well. Do your own spiritual exercises, and knowing
yourself to be the humblest servant of all, serve them. Those with whom
you are staying are such that even I am not worthy to call myself their
humblest servant and take the dust of their feet. Knowing this, serve
them and have devotion for them. Don't be angry even if they abuse or
even hurt you grievously. Never mix with women. Try to be hardy little
by little, and gradually accustom yourself to maintaining the body out
of the proceeds of begging. Whoever takes the name of Ramakrishna, know
him to be your Guru. Everyone can play the role of a master, but it is
very difficult to be a servant. Specially you should follow Shashi. Know
it for certain that without steady devotion for the Guru and unflinching
patience and perseverance, nothing is to be achieved. You must have
strict morality. Deviate an inch from this, and you are gone forever.

Yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.
