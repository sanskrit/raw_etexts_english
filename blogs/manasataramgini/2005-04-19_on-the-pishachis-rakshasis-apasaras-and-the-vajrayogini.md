We had in our long wanderings encountered many a pishAchi, rAkSasi and
apsarA. What we were fated to have we knew not. We were locked in the
embrace of the the vajrayoginI. We sunk into the ultimate intoxication
of her ApInavakshAbyaH and gazed at her urUbhyaH with our third eye
which was open in midst of the kR^iShNa rAtrI, even as mahAkAla danced
the tANDava on our shikhA. She split herself into three forms and
provided us pleasure in the midst of the kAlarAtrI and the yuddhachakra.
We now hold on to her before the uncovering of the pishAchi’s face
hoping that she might possess the nagara-pishAchi herself.
