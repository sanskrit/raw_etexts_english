title = "naming of the initiates as per the classic siddhAntaxa0tantras"

+++
The siddhAnta tantrics receive their names as per a fixed procedure:
After the student receives mantra dIkSha from the preceptor, s/he is
taken to the central kumbha in which shiva has been invoked earlier.
Then, the student casts flowers which s/he is holding in his hand on the
kumbha. His name prefix is chosen based on a name or attribute of the
pa\~nchabrahma mUrti in whose direction the flowers fall. Top:IshAna,
West: sadyojAta, East: tatpuruSha, South: aghora; North: vAmadeva.

If the student is a brAhmaNa he receives the suffix shiva (e.g.
varma-shiva, aghora-shiva, IshAna-shiva etc), if he is a kShatriya its
is deva (e.g. bhoja-deva, trilochana-deva, ishAna-deva etc.), if he is a
vaishya or shUdra a suffix of gaNa is added (e.g mUrtigaNa, shaMkara
gaNa etc.). If the student is a woman then she receives and additional
suffix shakti (e.g .tryaMbakadevashakti).
