Contrary to many popular notions that are perpetuated by Hollywood and
the public, the Germanic people (Of which Vikings are but a subgroup)
were not an anarchic people composed wholly of warriors or grunting
savages in poorly constructed huts, who held strong notions of liberty
and equality, with 1-1 ratios of men and women in the shieldwall.

Our ancestors lived in a stable and intricate social hierarchy with
clearly defined obligations and duties for each rung of the latter you
might find yourself inhabiting. This would include the notion of
hereditary castes in a Tripartite structure that will be instantly
familiar to scholars of Dumézil or our brothers in other faiths such as
Hinduism. We are going to review the Rígsþula and the writings of
Tacitus to bring to light some of the ancient beliefs and structure of
Germanic society.

We must first start with the Rígsþula – The lay of Rig – and the God
that starts off the entire poem. As the Rígsþula describes him:

*Once walked, ’tis said, the green ways along,*  
*mighty and ancient, a god most glorious;*  
*strong and vigorous, striding, Rig.*

The tales ancient roots can be seen in the name of the eponymous Deity.
Rig is a God that is otherwise unattested to (And later we’ll talk about
who he might be) and can therefore be considered the be a pseudonym or a
title for a more familiar deity. The word Rig is an old one and roughly
means “Lord, King”. The term is identical to the Irish “Rig – King” and
cognate to the the Sanskrit “Rajah”, the Gaulish “Rix” and the Latin
“Rex” all meaning the same thing: Sovereign or King. The term is
thought to derive from the the Proto-Indo-European “\*h₃rēǵs* – *to
straighten, to order, to rule*” *and as we will see, that is precisely
what Rig intends to do with the race of Man.

*Ever on he went in the middle of the way,*  
*till he came to a house with a door on its posts*  
*He entered straight; there was fire on the floor*  
*and a hoary couple sitting by the hearth,*  
*Great-grandfather and mother in ancient guise.*

*Great-grandmother fetched a coarse-baked loaf,*  
*all heavy and thick and crammed with husk:*  
*she bore it forth in the middle of the dish,*  
*with broth in a bowl, and laid the board.*

Here we can see the first house visited by Rig, it is a simple dwelling
inhabited by simple people of meager means. The occupants are called the
Great-Grandparents, and this can be taken to mean that the visit
happened long ago, perhaps even out of living memory. These simple
people live in a house and possess tools and agriculture, but the
house’s door is closed (Denoting perhaps, an unwillingness to entertain
guests. Perhaps out of a lack of charitableness or simple poverty) and
the food is rough and coarse.

![thrall](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/thrall.jpg?w=287&h=440)

*Thence Rig uprose, prepared to rest;*  
*well he knew how to give them counsel*  
*he laid him down in the middle of the bed*  
*and the home-folk twain upon either side.*  
*Thus he tarried three nights together,*  
*then on he strode in the middle of the road*  
*while thrice three moons were gliding by.*

*Great-grandmother bore a swarthy boy;*  
*with water they sprinkled him, called him Thrall.*  
*Forthwith he grew and well he throve,*  
*bur tough were his hands with wrinkled skin,*  
*with knuckles knotty and fingers thick;*  
*his face was ugly, his back was humpy,*  
*his heels were long.*  
*Straightway ‘gan he to prove his strength,*  
*with bast a-binding loads a-making,*  
*he bore home faggots the livelong day.*

Here we see that spends some time in the bed of the couple, impregnates
the wife and nine months later she gives birth to a son. (We can perhaps
ascribe such actions to the whims of Deities, for as any good husband
can attest, its not a common practice for guests to sleep with your
wife) The son is Swarthy, dark and black in coloring, ugly and strangely
shapen. He nonetheless possess great physical strength and is set to
simple menial work carrying bundles of sticks (the old use of Faggots is
used here, lest our more modern comrades get quite confused indeed).

This occupation should come as no surprise to anyone, For the sons name
is emblematic of his Function. Thrall is a Norse word meaning “Slave”,
the lowest and poorest of all social classes, those not even in
possession of themselves. Thralls black and ugly appearance can be seen
in relation to Germanic society, for most Thralls would have been
foreigners and quite physically distinct from the others in their
society.

*There came to the dwellings a wandering maid,*  
*with wayworn feet, and sunburned arms,*  
*with down-bent nose,- the Bond-maid named.*

*She sat her down in the middle of the floor;*  
*beside her sat the son of the house:*  
*they chatted and whispered, their bed preparing*  
*Thrall and Bond-maid — the long day through.*

As Thrall matures he is soon matched with a partner of his own social
rank and the two are married together. The two of them interact with
each other happily enough, they “Chat and Whisper” and prepare to go to
bed.

*Joyous lived they and reared their children.*  
*Thus they called them: Brawler, Cowherd,*  
*Boor and Horsefly, Lewd and Lustful,*  
*Stout and Stumpy, Sluggard, Swarthy,*  
*Lout and Leggy. They fashioned fences,*  
*they dunged the meadows, swine they herded,*  
*goats they tended and turf they dug.*

*Daughters were there, — Loggy and Cloggy,*  
*Lumpy-leggy, and Eagle-nose,*  
*Whiner, Bondwoman, Oaken-peggy,*  
*Tatter-coat and the Crane-shanked maid.*  
*Thence are come the generations of thralls.*

The children of the union inherit the social ranking of their parents
and their own physical attributes. It is important here to note the
moral attributes that the children inherit from their parents, various
they are violent, annoying and stupid, lustful and complainers. They are
in effect, not very good people and what we might today refer to as “Low
Class”.

The journey of Rig is however, just begun and he is obviously
unsatisfied with the results of the son he produced with
Great-Grandmother. He soon goes to another house inhabited by the next
generation and the process repeats itself.

*Ever on went Rig the straight roads along*  
*till he came to a dwelling with door unclosed;*  
*he entered straight; there was fire in the floor;*  
*Grandfather and Grandmother owned the house.*

*The home-folk sat there hard a-working;*  
*by them stood on the floor a box;*  
*hewed the husband wood for a warp-beam;*  
*trim his beard and the locks o’er his brow,*  
*but mean and scanty the shirt he wore.*

![karl](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/karl.jpg?w=676)

We can see here that the house of the Grandparents is very different
than the previous generation, the occupants are hard workers with a
cottage industry, they are well groomed but still not wealthy but the
door to their house is open inviting guests. Like the previous house,
Rig sleeps among the couple and nine months later a son is born to them.

*A child had Grandmother, Karl they called him,*  
*and sprinkled with water and swathed in linen,*  
*rosy and ruddy, with sparkling eyes.*  
*He grew and throve, and forthwith ‘gan he*  
*to break in oxen, to shape the harrow,*  
*to build him houses and barns to raise him,*  
*to fashion carts and follow the plough.*

The child born to the union is very different from the last, this one is
of a ruddy (reddish pink) color with bright colored eyes that sparkle.
His name is also emblematic of his occupation, for a Karl is Norse for a
Freeman. He owns a farm and provides for his own household, he likely is
also a part time warrior to defend his holdings and raid that of others
with his Lord. Karl likewise is matched with a woman of equal social
rank, and the two are happily married.

*Then home they drove with a key-hung maiden*  
*in goat-skin kirtle, named Daughter-in-Law.*  
*They wed her to Karl in her bridal linen:*  
*the twain jade ready, their wealth a-sharing,*  
*kept house together, and joyous lived.*

*Children reared they thus they called them:*  
*Youth and Hero, Thane, Smith, Yeoman,*  
*Broad-limb, Peasant, Sheaf-beard, Neighbor,*  
*Farmer, Speaker and Stubbly-beard.*

*By other names were the daughters called:*  
*Dame, Bride, Lady, Gay, and Gaudy,*  
*Maid, Wife, Woman, Bashful, Slender.*  
*Thence are come the kindreds of Karls.*

Again we must speak of the manner in which the two live. Unlike the last
couple, Karl and his wife are partners in their home, they share their
wealth and live happily. The children of the union inherit their moral
qualities and are respectable members of their communities, one of them,
Hero, is even celebrated.

However Rig has proven to be a very discerning deity for he still
considers this union to not be quite good enough for him. He continues
on to the last house where Mother and Father live to reenact the same
course of events.

*Still on went Rig the straight roads along*  
*till he came to a hall whose gates looked south.*  
*Pushed was the door to, a ring in the post set:*  
*he forthwith entered the rush-strewn room.*  
*Each other eyeing, the home-folk sat there —*  
*Father and Mother, — twirling their fingers.*  
*There was the husband, string a-twining,*  
*shafting arrows and shaping bows:*  
*and there was the wife o’er her fair arms wondering,*  
*smoothing her linen, stretching her sleeves.*  
*A high-peaked coif and a breast-brooch wore she,*  
*trailing robes and a blue-tinged sark.*  
*Her brow was brighter, her breast was fairer,*  
*her throat was whiter than driven snow.*

![jarl](https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/jarl.jpg?w=676)

Now this house is very different from the others that Rig has visited,
for this house is populated by a man who is not engaging in any real
work at all. Husband is shafting arrows and shaping bows, showing his
chief pursuits are warfare and the hunt. His wife is clothed in fine
garments and she is beautiful to behold. The house is notably properly
built and open to all guests in a display that cannot be misunderstood.
Rig again sleeps with the woman and produces a son that is born nine
months later.

*A son had Mother, in silk they wrapped him,*  
*With water they sprinkled him, Jarl he was*  
*Blond was his hair, and bright his cheeks*  
*Grim as a snake’s were his glowing eyes*

*To grow in the house did Jarl begin*  
*Shields he brandished, and bow-strings wound*  
*Bows he shot, and shafts he fashioned*  
*Arrows he loosened, and lances wielded*  
*Horses he rode, and hounds unleashed*  
*Swords he handled, and sounds he swam*

The son is born born and he is named Jarl (Lord). His appearance belies
the prototypical Norse standard, with blonde hair and fair skin, his
eyes glow with radiance and intelligence and he has a grim and stern
look to him. Jarls chief occupations concern skills with weapons,
hunting and athletics. He is obviously quite wealthy.

This is apparently pleasing to Rig for he visits no more houses and sets
off to meet his son. Unlike the other children, Rig claims this son as
his own (very important in Germanic tradition, for it gives Jarl a soul
to inherit from his Father) and gives him advice for his life, which
Jarl proceeds to do.

*Straight from the grove came striding Rig*  
*Rig came striding, and runes he taught him*  
*By his name he called him, as son he claimed him*  
*And bade him seize his ancestral fields*  
*His ancestral fields, the ancient homes*

*Forward he rode through the forest dark*  
*O’er the frosty crags, till a hall he found*  
*His spear he shook, his shield he brandished*  
*His horse he spurred, with his sword he hewed*  
*Wars he raised, and reddened the field*  
*Warriors slew he, and land he won*

Jarl is advised by the God to claim his ancestral lands at the point of
a sword to kill the men occupying it and claim it for his own Othala.
The term here is an important one, Othala. It means a sacred inheritance
passed down from your ancestors, and can be used to describe heirlooms,
land, or even physical features. Notably Jarl is also taught knowledge
of the Runes, imparting onto him magical and academic knowledge that the
others do not possess, showing that Jarl is no simple brute but is also
a learned man.

In the next installment to this post, we will look into the identities
of Rig and his nature, The writings of Tacitus and the character of
Mannus, Jarl’s son Kon, and the historical nobility of the Germanic
people.
