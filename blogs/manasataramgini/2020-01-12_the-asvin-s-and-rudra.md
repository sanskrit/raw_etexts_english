title = "The Aśvin-s andxa0Rudra"

+++
The twin Aśvin-s and Rudra are both Indo-Aryan reflexes of two
deity-classes which can be reconstructed as likely being present in the
Proto-Indo-European religion. Both are likely to have even deeper roots
going back to even earlier religious traditions across a wide swath of
humanity. Indeed, the divine twins feature even outside the IE
religions. At the face of it it is not obvious if these two deity
classes show any special links. For example, with Rudra as a focus we
can use the Ṛgveda to sample his association with other deities. One
proxy for association can be how often Rudra is mentioned with another
deity in the same pāda or hemistich of a ṛk. Below is a table showing
his co-occurrences by this metric.

***Table 1. The association of various Devatā-s with Rudra in the RV***

| **Devatā** | **\#** |
| :--------- | -----: |
| Marut-s    |     21 |
| Vasu-s     |     18 |
| Āditya-s   |     13 |
| Agni       |     10 |
| Ṛbhu-s     |      7 |
| Indra      |      6 |
| Aśvin-s    |      6 |
| Soma       |      6 |
| Varuṇa     |      5 |
| Mitra      |      5 |
| Bhaga      |      5 |
| Puṣaṇ      |      4 |
| Viṣṇu      |      3 |
| Bṛhaspati  |      2 |
| Sarasvatī  |      2 |
| Tvaṣṭṛ     |      2 |
| Aryaman    |      1 |
| Savitṛ     |      1 |
| Aditi      |      1 |
| Vāyu       |      1 |

Not surprisingly, he is most closely associated with his sons the
Marut-s who are often referred to as the plurality of Rudra-s. The other
close associations come from the fact that the Rudra-s are mentioned as
a group of gods along side to two other big groups of gods: the Vasu-s
and the Āditya-s. He further shows notable associations with one of the
archetypal deities of the Vasu-group, Agni with who he shares a duality.
Beyond that his mentions along with the Aśvin-s is no more frequent than
with Soma, Indra or the Ṛbhu-s (the divine craftsmen whose masters are
said to be the Rudra-s: RV 8.7.12). That said a closer look reveals a
deeper link between Rudra and the Aśvin-s.

uta tyā me raudrāv arcimantā  
nāsatyāv indra gūrtaye yajadhyai |  
manuṣvad vṛktabarhiṣe rarāṇā  
mandū hitaprayasā vikṣu yajyū || RV 10.61.15

Also these two sons of Rudra, the Nāsatya-s \[worshiped\] with ṛk-s, are
to be welcomed and made offerings by me, O Indra. The two who are
liberal to him, who as Manu \[had done, invites them\] to the woven
grass (the twisted barhiṣ in the vedi), the delightful \[twins\] for
whom pleasing offerings are made, the twins who seek the ritual among
the people.

Here the ṛṣi Kakṣīvān calls the Aśvin-s the sons of Rudra in a manner
similar to the Marut-s. Further, this sūkta mentions our ancient
ancestor Cyavāna as the one who had measured out the vedi for the for
the Aśvin-s. Cyavāna is mentioned in tradition as the one who instituted
the rite where soma is offered to the Aśvin-s. Indeed, in the above ṛk
it appears that Kakṣīvān seeks Indra permission for the same as there
are indications from later narratives that Indra was not entirely on
board with that. In any case, what is important for our current
discussion is the relatively unambiguous link of the Aśvin-s and Rudra
in this ṛk.

This is not the only instance the Aśvin-s are called Rudra-s or the
son-s or Rudra. Indeed, we encounter another such example elsewhere in
the RV:

tāv id doṣā tā uṣasi śubhas  
patī tā yāman rudravartanī |  
mā no martāya ripave vājinī-  
vasū paro rudrāv ati khyatam || RV 8.22.14

Just these two in the evening, these two auspicious lords at dawn, the
two who follow the tracks of Rudra in the course. Don’t look over and
beyond us to a roguish mortal, O Rudra-s with booty-bearing mares.

In this ṛk of Sobhari Kāṇva, they are not just called Rudra-s but also
specific described as Rudravartanī. This word is of considerable
interest in regard to this connection between these deities. It belongs
to class of compounds of the form “x+vartani” that are found throughout
the RV and used for different deities. The word vartani means wheel
(typically of the chariot) or track of the chariot wheel. Thus,
x+vartani compounds are usually interpreted as bahuvrīhi-s. Below we
list all the instances of such compounds in the RV along with the gods
they denote and the number of occurrences of each case:

  - **Rudravartani**
      - Aśvin-s, 4
  - **Hiraṇyavartani**
      - Aśvin-s, 6
      - Sarasvatī, 1
      - river goddess, 1
  - **Raghuvartani**
      - Aśvin-s, 1
      - Soma, 1
  - **Ghṛtavartani**
      - Aśvin-s, 1
  - **Vṛjinvartani**
      - Agni, 1
  - **Kṛṣṇavartani**
      - Agni, 1
  - **Gāyatravartani**
      - Indrāgnī, 1
  - **Dvivartani**
      - Agni, 1

It is immediately apparent that this class of compounds are special
descriptors of the Aśvin-s for 12 of the 19 occurrences of them are used
for the Aśvin-s. This is likely a special allusion related to the
oft-mentioned speeding tricycle (tri-cakra) chariot of these gods.
However, it should be noted that such compounds, while most frequently
used for the Aśvin-s are not limited to them; e.g. Hiraṇya-vartani is
use for at least 2-3 distinct deities (river goddess Sindhu could be a
cryptic allusion to Sarasvatī). Some of the usages, such as
Hiraṇya-vartani or Raghu-vartani can be simply interpreted as the ones
with the golden wheels or one with swift wheels and appear to apply to
other deities than the Aśvin-s. Indeed, a related term “Hiraṇya-cakra”
is used for the actual Rudra-s, i.e. Marut-s (e.g. RV 1.88.5) or for
that matter Hiraṇya-ratha used for Indra (e.g. RV 1.30.16). Further,
some might be even typical of other deities: e.g. Kṛṣṇa-vartani (with
black tracks: alluding to the smoke) and Vṛjina-vartani (with curving
tracks, alluding to the flames) are apt for Agni for whom they are used.
The form dvi-vartana used Agni is simply indicative of two tracks left
behind by the two chariot wheels.

However, of all these Rudra-vartani is specifically used only for the
Aśvin-s on multiple occasions and by multiple composers. This suggests
that this term has a special connection with the Aśvin-s. Drawing the
cue from the more frequent Hiraṇya-vartani, also used for the Aśvin-s,
Rudra-vartani has been tradition interpreted as either Rudra= ruddy or
Rudra = fierce. Thus, the compound is understood as the Aśvin-s with
ruddy tracks, or those with fierce tracks — perhaps as an allusion to
their speeding chariot that is frequently seen in the RV, or as those
who go along terrifying paths. Entirely, independently of our
investigations, we learned that this line of reasoning was first
explored in detail by the great patriot Aurobindo Ghose. But the key is
the observation that this term is specific to the Aśvin-s. Rudra is not
used in the sense of “ruddy” elsewhere in the corpus. “Fierce or
terrible tracks” would have implied the form raudra-vartani, which we do
not ever encounter in this corpus. Further, ruddy horses or chariots are
described by terms like aruṇayugbhir aśvaiḥ (RV 6.65.2) and fierce
chariots by terms like tveṣa-ratha for the Marut-s (RV 5.61.13; also
perhaps a personal name of a Mitanni ruler among the Indo-Aryans of West
Asia). Indeed, the ferocity of the Marut-s’ chariots with ruddy horses
are alluded to elsewhere too (e.g. RV 1.88.2) but the term Rudravartani
is never applied to them even if it might be natural in this sense.

Thus, taken together with the instances where the Aśvin-s are called
Rudra-s or the sons of Rudra (see above and also below) we conclude that
Rudra-vartanī specifically indicates the association of the twins with
Rudra and means “the two who follow the track of Rudra”. After we
reached this conclusion, a search revealed that such a translation had
been independently conceived by the German indologist Hermann Oldenberg.
Notably, this link to Rudra is further strengthened by another instance
where they are called both Rudra-s and Hiraṇyavartanī:

ā no ratnāni bibhratāv  
aśvinā gacchataṃ yuvam |  
rudrā hiraṇyavartanī  
juṣāṇā vājinīvasū  
mādhvī mama śrutaṃ havam || RV 5.75.3  
Bearing treasures to us, Aśvins, come here, you two, O Rudra-s with
golden wheels, with booty-bearing mares, being pleased, the holders of
the honey-lore, hear my invocation.

We believe there are many dimensions to this connection:  
1\) The ancient name of the Aśvin-s is Divo Napatā. The twin sons of
Dyaus. This is an equivalent of the name of their Greek cognates the
Dioskouroi (the national deities of the Spartans), meaning the youths of
Zeus (the cognate of Dyaus; Skt Divaḥ Kumārau) or their Lithuanian
cognates Dievo Suneliai (Sons of Dieva = Dyaus). Now Dyaus on occasion
is identified with Asura Rudra in the RV:

tvam agne rudro asuro maho divaḥ (RV 2.1.6)  
You, O Agni, are Rudra the Asura of heaven (Dyaus)

yathā rudrasya sūnavo divo  
vaśanty asurasya vedhasaḥ | (RV 8.20.17)  
It shall be \[just\] as they wish, the sons of Rudra, the Asura of
heaven (Dyaus) are the wise ones.

And like in this case too:  
indrota tubhyaṃ tad dive tad rudrāya svayaśase | (RV 1.129.3)  
Indra, this is for you and that heaven (Dyaus), for that self-glorious
Rudra.

The above indicate that there was an early Vedic tradition that
identified Rudra with Dyaus, in which sense he was also seen as the
father of world by the Bharadvāja-s (RV 6.49.10). This, together with
the appellation Divo Napātā for the Aśvin-s, hints a parallel Vedic
tradition which saw them as deities in the Rudra-class associated with
the leader of that class Rudra, the great Asura of Dyaus. Their “Raudra
nature” is clearly brought out in the ṛk RV 10.93.7: uta no rudrā cin
mṛḻatām aśvinā : Also, though being Rudra-s, may the Aśvin-s be
merciful. This plea for mercy to them is comparable to that typically
made to Rudra or the Marut-s. Consistent with this, they share their
medical prowess with Rudra (as physicians of the gods) and even more
tellingly also their knowledge of poisons with Rudra (RV 1.117.16: where
they either kill the brood of Viṣvāc with poison or destroy the poison
associated with the brood of Viṣvāc). Thus, across the RV, composers
from different clans occasionally saw the Aśvin-s as Rudra-s or Rudra’s
sons and allude to their Rudrian properties.

2\) One of the notable aspects differentiating the early Atharvaṇ
tradition from the RV tradition with regard to Rudra is the use of the
twin appellation Bhavā-Śarvā for the deity in the former. These names of
Rudra also persist in the ādhvaryava tradition preserved in the
Yajurveda-s but the twinning is less prominent relative the AV
tradition. Notably, in the celebrated Mṛgāreṣṭi ritual the AV tradition
features a sūkta to the twin Bhavā-Śarvā whereas in its place the KYV
tradition has ṛk-s to the Aśvin-s. Notably, in the incantations for the
Śūlagava ox sacrifice laid out in the Śāṅkhāyana-śrautasūtra
(4.20.1-2), Bhavā-Śarvā are called the sons of Mahādeva.

tasya te dhanur hṛdayam mana iṣavaś cakṣur visargas tam tvā tathā veda
namas te astu somas tvā avatu mā mā hiṃsīḥ | yāv araṇye patayantau vṛkau
jambavantau iva | mahādevasya putrābhyām bhava-śarvābhyām namaḥ ||

The heart is your bow, the mind is your arrow, the eye is your shooting.
Thus we know you. Obeisance to you. May Soma protect him and may you
never ever harm me. The two who roam around in the forest like wolves
with jaws wide open; obeisance to the two sons of Mahādeva, Bhava and
Śarva.

This points to two parallel streams within the early Vedic tradition
which featured Rudra in singular form (apart from the plurality of the
Rudra-class) as seen in the RV or in twin form of Bhavā-Śarvā as seen in
the AV and the Śāṅkhāyana-śrautasūtra (as the twin sons of Rudra). This
suggests that the Rudra-class had an ancient intrinsic twin nature
shared with the Aśvin-s which lingers in the Bhavā-Śarvā dyad. Notably,
even in Greek tradition the deity of the Rudra-class, Apollo is born
with twin (albeit female), Artemis. While the RV Aśvin-s are identical
twins in character, sometimes, in the IE world one sees some
differentiation of the the twins with one of them associated with
healing and animal-husbandry and the other with warfare. For example,
among the Yavana-s, one of the pair, Castor is a horse-trainer while the
other one Polydeuces is a boxer. A similar differentiation is perhaps
reflected in the twin Rudra-s, with the name Bhava indicating welfare
and health, and the and Śarva meaning and archer and indicating the
warrior nature of the second twin. Thus, it is likely that Bhava and
Śarva were part of the parallel Vedic tradition where they played the
role of the Aśvin-s as twin Rudra-s.

3\) A later reflex of this twinning in the Rudra-class appears to have
emerged via developments in the form of the Kaumāra tradition emerging
in the Indo-Iranian borderlands. There we see the dual form of the god
Kumāra as Skanda-Viśākha. This dyad is earliest attested in the
Atharvavedīya-Skanda-yāga from the AV-pariśiṣṭha-s and has a prolonged
presence in the Hindu tradition. The grammarian Patañjali mentions metal
images of Rudra along with the Skanda-Viśākha dyad in the Mauryan age
(\~322-185 BCE). The persistence of this tradition is illustrated by a
much later attestation of this dyad, evidently drawn from a now lost
early tradition, seen in the Kālikā-purāṇa with a predominantly East
Indian locus:

dahano ‘pi tathā kāle prāpte gaṅgodare svayam |  
retaḥ saṅkrāmayāmāsa śāṃbhavaṃ svarṇa-sannibham ||  
Agni himself, in due course of time, transmitted the semen of Rudra,
which shone like gold, to the womb of Gaṅgā.

sā tena retasā devī sarva-lakṣaṇa-saṃyutaṃ |  
pūrṇa-kāle ‘tha suṣuve putra-yugmaṃ manoharam ||  
Then by that semen the goddess, upon completion of pregnancy, gave birth
to charming twin sons endowed with all \[good\] features.

ekaḥ skando viśākhākhyo dvitīyaś cāru-rūpa-dhṛk |  
śakti-dvaya-dharau dvau tau tejaḥ kānti-vivardhitau|| KP 46.82-84  
The first was Skanda and the second bearing a beautiful form was known
as Viśākha. The two held a spear each and two shone with their radiance.

Thus, we see Rudra siring the twin Kaumāra deities Skanda and Viśākha
who are described as bearing spears much like the depiction of the
spear-bearing Dioscuri in the yavana tradition. Interestingly, their
beauty is specifically described much like that of the Aśvin-s in Vedic
tradition. Further, the Kālikā-purāṇa recommends the worship of this
dual Kaumāra form for the ṣaṣṭhī night:

rātrau skanda-viśākhasya kṛtvā piṣṭa-putrikām |  
pujayec chatrunāśāya durgāyāḥ prīyate tathā || KP 60.50  
In the night having made images of Skanda and Viśākha from flour one
should worship them for the destruction of enemies and for pleasing
Durgā.

In archaeological terms we find depictions of the Skanda-Viśākha dyad on
Kuṣāṇa coins and also Kuṣāṇa age images from a lost Kaumāra shrine from
the holy city Mathura (now housed in the collections of the Mathura
museum). What is notable about their numismatic appearances is their
resemblance to the twin gods on Greek Dioscuri coins. Thus, like
Bhava-Śarva in a parallel Vedic tradition, Skanda-Viśākha are likely
developments of the ancient Raudra twins in a Para-Vedic tradition that
then entered the Indo-Aryan mainstream.

4\) Finally, it is plausible that the term Rudravartanī and the
association of the Aśvin-s with Rudra have an astronomical significance.
In the classic nakṣatra system that developed by the time of the AV and
the YV the Aśvin-s are associated with the constellation of Aśvayujau
which corresponds to part of Aries. However, the obvious constellation
that resembles the divine twins is Gemini, which was recognized as the
Dioscuri in the Greek tradition. While it was termed the constellation
of Aditi, the ārya-s too recognized the dual nature of the asterism
Punarvasu made up two stars Castor and Pollux — it is occasionally used
in dual like: punarvasū nakṣatram aditir devatā ||. Early on we see the
recognition of the twin nature in the statement that Aditi is two-headed
in the Yajurveda (Taittirīya Saṃhitā in 1.2.4; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
3.2.4.16). Ironically, Pāṇini reinforces the dual nature with the sūtra:
chandasi punarvasvor ekavacanam || PAA 1.2.61. In the Veda Punarvasu
might be \[optionally take a\] singular declension. The grammarians
clarify that this is limited to the Veda while in common speech it is
always dual indicating its twin nature. The only direct allusion to the
asterism in RV (along with Revati) appears to be in RV 10.19.1 (by our
ancestor Cyavāna), which associates it with Agni and Soma in a cryptic
hymn whose actual meaning has been hard to discern. However, a potential
connection is seen in RV 10.39.11 where the Aśvin-s are called
Rudravartanī and explicitly linked Aditi — pairing that is otherwise
rather unusual:

na taṃ rājānāv adite kutaś cana  
nāṃho aśnoti duritaṃ nakir bhayam |  
yam aśvinā suhavā rudravartanī  
purorathaṃ kṛṇuthaḥ patnyā saha || RV 10.39.11  
From nowhere troubles nor evil nor fear reach him, along with his wife,
for whom you two kings and Aditi prepare a chariot to be in the
forefront. O Aśvins, you who are easy to invoke, follow the track of
Rudra.

We take this to mean that the Aśvin-s here are associated with Aditi and
thereby the asterism of Punarvasu. Now, Punarvasu rises after the
constellation of Rudra, i.e. Ārdra (corresponding to Sirius and the
proximal bright stars of Canis Major). Thus, we can see the twins
literally following the track of Rudra in the sky.
