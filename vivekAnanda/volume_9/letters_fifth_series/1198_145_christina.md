## CXLV

*To Sister Christine*

RIDGELY MANOR,

*20th September 1899*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

I am much better, thank you. Hitherto, excepting three days, there has
not been any wet weather to speak of here. Miss \[Margaret\] Noble came
yesterday, and we are having a jolly good time. I am very, very sorry to
say I am growing fat again. That is bad. I will eat less and grow thin
once more.

You are again at work — so do I find — only with a little variation of
the old occupation. Better rest than mere idling. Do you like my new
poem? (*Vide [Complete Works](../../volume_4/writings_poems/peace.htm)*
, IV for the text of the poem "Peace" enclosed in this letter.) Miss
Noble thinks it is nice. But that is her way with everything I do. So
you also say. I will now send my writings to missionary papers to get a
fierce criticism.

With all love to you and Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\],

Ever yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
