title = "The first three squareable Lunes"

For the sake of some readers we shall first define a lune: A lune is a
concave closed region bounded by two circular arcs respectively with
radii
![r\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r_1") and
![r\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r_2") and distance between their centers as
![d](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "d"),
where ![r\_1 \\geq
r\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_1+%5Cgeq+r_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r_1 \\geq r_2"). This region looks like a digit of the moon (hence lune
or what Hindus call the indukalā) or the illuminated fraction of a star
or planetary body eclipsed by another. The formula for the area of the
lune is complicated but has a nice symmetry to it:

![A\_l=r\_2^2
\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{r\_1^2-r\_2^2-d^2}{2dr\_2}\\right)-r\_1^2\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{r\_1^2-r\_2^2+d^2}{2dr\_1}\\right)+\\\\\[5pt\]
\\dfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\left(d+r\_1+r\_2\\right)\\left(d-r\_1+r\_2\\right)\\left(d+r\_1-r\_2\\right)\\left(-d+r\_1+r\_2\\right)}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_l%3Dr_2%5E2+%5Ccos%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7Br_1%5E2-r_2%5E2-d%5E2%7D%7B2dr_2%7D%5Cright%29-r_1%5E2%5Ccos%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7Br_1%5E2-r_2%5E2%2Bd%5E2%7D%7B2dr_1%7D%5Cright%29%2B%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cleft%28d%2Br_1%2Br_2%5Cright%29%5Cleft%28d-r_1%2Br_2%5Cright%29%5Cleft%28d%2Br_1-r_2%5Cright%29%5Cleft%28-d%2Br_1%2Br_2%5Cright%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_l=r_2^2 \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{r_1^2-r_2^2-d^2}{2dr_2}\\right)-r_1^2\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{r_1^2-r_2^2+d^2}{2dr_1}\\right)+\\\\[5pt] \\dfrac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\left(d+r_1+r_2\\right)\\left(d-r_1+r_2\\right)\\left(d+r_1-r_2\\right)\\left(-d+r_1+r_2\\right)}")

One notices from the formula that the first two terms with inverse
cosine functions can give rise to transcendental numbers, like fractions
of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi"). Due to the subtraction at certain angles these can potentially
cancel each other out leaving the 3rd term which is in principle
geometrically constructable. This suggests that the quadrature of at
least some lunes should be possible in principle.

At some point during our school years, shortly after acquiring some
elementary geometrical insights, we learned of this problem of the
squaring of lunes – we quickly performed for ourselves the construction
of the lunes specified by a rectangle and
![\\dfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{1}{4}")th square lune and proved their quadrature (simple
problems). A few years later we successfully conquered the trapezium
lune and proved its quadrature for ourselves as part of a study of some
Hindu mathematics. The third squareable lune is conceptually similar but
its conventional compass and straight-edge construction needs one to
construct a segment of length
![\\dfrac{\\sqrt{11}+\\sqrt{3}}{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B11%7D%2B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{\\sqrt{11}+\\sqrt{3}}{2}"). While relatively easy, this was
practically cumbersome given the usual paper-size we used those days for
our physical compass/ruler constructions. It was then that we read of
Proclus mentioning yavana-s using a “cheat” for this purpose. But a
comparable “cheat” is rather natural to Hindus due their geometry being
dependent on the raśmi; hence we use here.

The remaining two squareable lunes were apparently first proved to be so
by Euler (though it is also attributed to some others). To construct
them exactly with a compass and straight-edge would need one to
construct lengths which are expressed as ratios of grisly multiple
nested radicals and we have never attempted to do so nor figured out a
way using other curves. Likewise, the deep reasons for the very
existence of only these five and no more squareable lunes remained
beyond us. Baffled by all this any fancies we might have had of pursuing
mathematics as a mode of living came to an end. It showed us that there
are kinds of insight and understanding pertaining to mathematical
expression that are not easy or even possible for a human with a limited
mental capacity to acquire as a part of his regular course of existence.
Aristotle informs us regarding the yavana Hippocrates, who achieved the
initial lune quadratures, that he was so immersed in his geometry that
he was pretty much lost in his regular life: a stark reminder of the
blurring of the boundaries between mathematical virtuosity and
dysfunctionality. This was something we could appreciate despite lacking
that virtuosity.

Yet, what we did learn regarding the lunes was rather fascinating and
reminded us of experiments with other curves whose area becomes
independent of
![\\pi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\pi"), like a type of lemniscate we described earlier. The
construction of the classic
![\\dfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{1}{4}")th square lune is part of some yantra-s such as the
bhūtavijaya and the Hindu re-appropriation of Mañjughoṣa. We have also
seen an intriguing figure termed the śṛṣṭi-yantra contemplated upon by
sādhaka-s in the school of the kaula practitioner Haṃsamiṭṭhu from
Gujarat, which includes the first two and possibly the third squareable
lune. We have not seen any textual precedence for this. We place here
the construction of the first three squareable lunes.

**The four lunes specified by a rectangle and the
![\\dfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{1}{4}")th square lune**

![lune\_tetrad](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/lune_tetrad.png?w=640)  
Figure 1

1\) Draw a rectangle ABCD inside a circle (Figure 1). Every rectangle by
definition is a cyclic quadrilateral; hence it will be circumscribed in
a circle.  
2\) Draw semicircles on each side of the rectangle. Four lunes are
defined by the region between the circumcircle of ABCD and the four
semicircles on its sides (Figure 1).  
3\) The sum of the area of the 4 lunes is equal to that of the rectangle
ABCD used to define them.  
4\) While we could use the above area formula to prove this, it is
visually much easier to use the construction: let
![\\overline{AB}=a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%3Da&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}=a");
![\\overline{BC}=b](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D%3Db&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BC}=b"); let radius of the circumcircle of the rectangle
ABCD be ![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r").  
5\) The area a given lune
(![A\_l](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_l&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_l")) in the construction can be visualized as the difference of the
area of the semicircle with diameter as one of the sides of the
rectangle ABCD
(![A\_s](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_s&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_s")) and the area of the circular segment or cap
(![A\_{cp}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bcp%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{cp}")) of the circumcircle of rectangle ABCD delimited by the cord
which is one of the sides of the said rectangle. Thus
![A\_l=A\_s-A\_{cp}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_l%3DA_s-A_%7Bcp%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_l=A_s-A_{cp}").  
6\) For the 4 lunes we get two pairs of semicircles, each pair
corresponding to one of the pairs of congruent sides of the rectangle.
Thus, the total area
(![A\_{ts}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bts%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{ts}")) bounded by the four semicircles forming the 4 lunes is the
sum of the areas of the circles having the two adjacent sides of the
rectangle as their diameters: ![A\_{ts}=\\pi
\\left(\\left(\\dfrac{a}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\dfrac{b}{2}\\right)^2\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bts%7D%3D%5Cpi+%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7Ba%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%2B%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7Bb%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%5E2%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{ts}=\\pi \\left(\\left(\\dfrac{a}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\dfrac{b}{2}\\right)^2\\right)").  
7\) Now a right angle inscribed in a circle defines a semicircle.
Therefore the diagonals of the rectangle are diameters of its
circumcircle;
![\\overline{AC}=\\overline{BD}=2r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAC%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BBD%7D%3D2r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AC}=\\overline{BD}=2r"). By the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya
![a^2+b^2=4r^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2%2Bb%5E2%3D4r%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a^2+b^2=4r^2")

8\) ![\\therefore A\_{ts}=\\pi \\left(\\dfrac{a^2+b^2}{4}\\right)=\\pi
r^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+A_%7Bts%7D%3D%5Cpi+%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5E2%2Bb%5E2%7D%7B4%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Cpi+r%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\therefore A_{ts}=\\pi \\left(\\dfrac{a^2+b^2}{4}\\right)=\\pi r^2")  
9\) The total area of the four caps of the circumcircle
(![A\_{tcp}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Btcp%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{tcp}")) defined by the rectangle ABCD can be seen from the
construction as being: ![A\_{tcp}=A(circumcircle)-A(rectangle ABCD)=\\pi
r^2-ab](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Btcp%7D%3DA%28circumcircle%29-A%28rectangle+ABCD%29%3D%5Cpi+r%5E2-ab&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{tcp}=A(circumcircle)-A(rectangle ABCD)=\\pi r^2-ab").  
10\) Thus we can get the total area of the four lunes
(![A\_{tl}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Btl%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{tl}")) to complete the proof: ![A\_{tl}=A\_{ts}-A\_{tcp}=\\pi
r^2-(\\pi
r^2-ab)=ab](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Btl%7D%3DA_%7Bts%7D-A_%7Btcp%7D%3D%5Cpi+r%5E2-%28%5Cpi+r%5E2-ab%29%3Dab&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{tl}=A_{ts}-A_{tcp}=\\pi r^2-(\\pi r^2-ab)=ab")

![lune1by4](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/lune1by4.png?w=640)  
Figure 2

From the above construction (Figure 1) it is also clear that for any
right triangle inscribed in a circle the two lunes formed by the
circumcircle and semicircles on the two orthogonal sides of the triangle
have a total area equal to that of the right triangle. A special case of
the above construction leads to the first squareable single lune (Figure
2): If the two adjacent sides of the rectangle ABCD were equal then it
becomes a square (Figure 2). Then the 4 lunes will have equal area and
the area of each of these lunes will
![\\dfrac{1}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{1}{4}") that of square (from Figure 2):  
![\\therefore A\_l=\\dfrac{1}{4}A(ABCD)=A(\\triangle
OBC)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+A_l%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7DA%28ABCD%29%3DA%28%5Ctriangle+OBC%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\therefore A_l=\\dfrac{1}{4}A(ABCD)=A(\\triangle OBC)")  
As can be seen from Figure 2 this lune can be easily constructed by the
intersection of the circumcircle of square ABCD and semicircle erected
on the hypotenuse of the quarter square ![\\triangle
OBC](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+OBC&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle OBC").

**The squareable trapezium lune**

![lune\_trapezium](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/lune_trapezium.png?w=640)  
Figure 3

1\) Take point A at origin (Figure 3). Draw a point
![Y\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_1") at distance 1 unit above it along the y-axis. Draw point
![Y\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_2") at distance 3 units below it along the y-axis.  
2\) Obtain the midpoint of
![Y\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_1") and
![Y\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_2") (the arithmetic mean operation), namely
![Y\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_3"). Draw a semicircle with
![\\overline{Y\_1Y\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BY_1Y_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{Y_1Y_2}") as diameter and
![Y\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_3") as center. Draw a perpendicular to
![\\overline{Y\_1Y\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BY_1Y_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{Y_1Y_2}") at point A to cut the semicircle at point B. By
geometric mean theorem
![\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{3}")  
3\) Bisect
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}") to obtain point P. With P as center and radius .5 cut
arcs on either side on
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}") to obtain points Q and R. draw perpendiculars to
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}") at points Q and R.  
4\) With points A and B as centers and radius 1 cut the above
perpendiculars drawn at points Q and R to obtain points C and D. Join
points A, B, C, D to obtain isoceles trapezium ABCD with sides
![\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{3},
\\overline{BC}=\\overline{CD}=\\overline{DA}=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%2C+%5Coverline%7BBC%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BCD%7D%3D%5Coverline%7BDA%7D%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{3}, \\overline{BC}=\\overline{CD}=\\overline{DA}=1").  
5\) By definition every isoceles trapezium is a cyclic quadrilateral.
Obtain its circumcenter by drawing perpendicular bisectors any two sides
and finding their point of concurrency, point E. With point E as center
draw the circumcircle of ABCD. This will be the smaller circle bounding
the desired lune.  
6\) Draw a line perpendicular to
![\\overline{BC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BC}") at point B. With radius
![\\overline{BE}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBE%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BE}"), i.e. same as circumcircle of ABCD, and center as B
cut the the above perpendicular line to obtain point F (thus this
perpendicular line with henceforth be
![\\overleftrightarrow{BF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BBF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

obtain
![\\overleftrightarrow{CF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BCF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{CF}"). Thus, ![\\triangle
CBF](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+CBF&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle CBF") is a right triangle. Extend
![\\overline{BC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BC}") as
![\\overleftrightarrow{BC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BBC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{BC}"). With B as center and radius
![\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

![\\overleftrightarrow{BC}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BBC%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{BC}") to get point H. Through point H draw a line
parallel to
![\\overleftrightarrow{CF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BCF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

![\\overleftrightarrow{BF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BBF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{BF}") at point I.  
7\) Using
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}") as the base and radius
![\\overline{BI}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BBI%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{BI}") construct isoceles ![\\triangle
ABJ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ABJ&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle ABJ"). With point J as center draw a circle passing through
points A and B. This will be the larger circle of the lune; thus we now
have the second squareable lune (Figure 3).

Here again rather than use the area formula we can use the construction
and some simpler formulae to establish its quadrature. From the
construction (Figure 3) we can establish the following:  
1\) Area of isoceles trapezium ABCD is
![A(ABCD)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28ABCD%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A(ABCD)").  
2\) The area of cap of the bigger circle on side AB is
(![A\_{cp1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bcp1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{cp1}"))  
3\) The three caps
(![A\_{cp2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bcp2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{cp2}")) of the smaller circle on sides BC, CD and DA are equal
because by construction they subtend congruent angles.  
4\) The area of the lune is:
![A(ABCD)+3A\_{cp2}-A\_{cp1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28ABCD%29%2B3A_%7Bcp2%7D-A_%7Bcp1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A(ABCD)+3A_{cp2}-A_{cp1}")  
5\) The area of a cap of a circle with radius
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r"),
where the cord defining the cap subtends an angle
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta") at the center is ![\\dfrac{r^2}{2}\\left(\\theta-\\sin

"\\dfrac{r^2}{2}\\left(\\theta-\\sin \\left(\\theta \\right)\\right)").

![\\therefore A\_l=A(ABCD)+3\\dfrac{r\_2^2}{2}\\left(\\theta\_2-\\sin

"\\therefore A_l=A(ABCD)+3\\dfrac{r_2^2}{2}\\left(\\theta_2-\\sin \\left(\\theta_2 \\right)\\right)-\\dfrac{r_1^2}{2}\\left(\\theta_1-\\sin \\left(\\theta_1 \\right)\\right)")  
6\) From our construction ![\\triangle BEC \\cong \\triangle CED \\cong

AJB](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+BEC+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle+CED+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle+DEA+%5Csim+%5Ctriangle+AJB&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle BEC \\cong \\triangle CED \\cong \\triangle DEA \\sim \\triangle AJB").
Thus ![\\angle AJB = \\theta\_1 \\cong \\angle BEC \\cong \\angle CED

Thus, the area of our lune is the same as the isoceles trapezium used in
its construction.

Now what is the area of this trapezium. Since it is a cyclic
quadrilateral, we can use Brahmagupta’s theorem to find its area:  
![A(ABCD)=\\\\\[5pt\]
\\dfrac{1}{4}\\sqrt{(-a+b+c+d)(a-b+c+d)(a+b-c+d)(a+b+c-d)}\\\\\[5pt\]
a=\\sqrt{3};\\; b=c=d=1\\\\\[5pt\] \\therefore
A(ABCD)=A\_l=\\dfrac{(1+\\sqrt{3})^{3/2}\\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{3}}}{4} \\approx
1.27](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28ABCD%29%3D%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D%5Csqrt%7B%28-a%2Bb%2Bc%2Bd%29%28a-b%2Bc%2Bd%29%28a%2Bb-c%2Bd%29%28a%2Bb%2Bc-d%29%7D%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+a%3D%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%3B%5C%3B+b%3Dc%3Dd%3D1%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+A%28ABCD%29%3DA_l%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%281%2B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%5Csqrt%7B3-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7D%7B4%7D+%5Capprox+1.27&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

Interestingly, the third term in the area of the lune formula provided
in the beginning of the article has resemblance to the Brahmagupta
formula. As the two ‘curved’ terms in the area formula cancel out the
third term essentially becomes equal to the area of of the trapezium.

Now we can get the radius of the smaller circle
![r\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r_2") of the lune because it is the circumcircle of trapezium ABCD
using Parameśvara’s theorem:  
![r\_2=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{(ab+cd)(ac+bd)(ad+bc)}}{4A(ABCD)}\\\\\[5pt\]
=\\dfrac{(1+\\sqrt{3})^{3/2}}{4} \\times
\\dfrac{4}{(1+\\sqrt{3})^{3/2}\\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{3}}}=\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{3}}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Csqrt%7B%28ab%2Bcd%29%28ac%2Bbd%29%28ad%2Bbc%29%7D%7D%7B4A%28ABCD%29%7D%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%281%2B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%7D%7B4%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cdfrac%7B4%7D%7B%281%2B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E%7B3%2F2%7D%5Csqrt%7B3-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B3-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

Now the angle subtended by a cord of length
![a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "a") at
the center of a circle with radius
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r")
is:  
![\\theta=

Taking cord

"\\overline{BC}") and radius
![r\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

![\\theta=2\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3-\\sqrt{3}}}{2}\\right)\\approx

From the construction this is the inner angle ![\\angle

**The squareable trapezium-triangle difference lune**

![lune3\_concave](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/lune3_concave.png?w=640)  
Figure 4

1\) Take a point A and draw point
![Y\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_1") 1 unit above it along the y-axis (Figure 4). Draw point
![Y\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_2") 2 units below it along the y-axis. Find their midpoint
![Y\_3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_3&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Y_3") (arithmetic mean operation) and draw a semicircle with
![\\overline{Y\_1Y\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BY_1Y_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{Y_1Y_2}") as its diameter. Draw a perpendicular at point A
to
![\\overleftrightarrow{Y\_1Y\_2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7BY_1Y_2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{Y_1Y_2}") which cuts the semicircle at point B.
Thus by the geometric mean theorem
![\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}=\\sqrt{2}").  
2\) Draw the perpendicular bisector of
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}"), which we will call
![\\overleftrightarrow{g}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7Bg%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{g}"). Here is where the special trick comes in
which we shall describe in terms of using a rajju and śaṅku. Mark off a
length of
![\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{3}") from a śaṅku tied on the rajju. This length can be easily
constructed as described above using the geometric mean theorem. Move
that śaṅku along
![\\overleftrightarrow{g}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7Bg%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{g}") keeping the opposite end of the rajju to one
on which the
![\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{3}") has been marked taut. When it passes through point A, peg
the rajju to point A and also to
![\\overleftrightarrow{g}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7Bg%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{g}"). This point on
![\\overleftrightarrow{g}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7Bg%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{g}") is D.  
3\) Using the marked end of the rajju draw a circle of radius
![\\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{3}") with point D as center. With point B as center and radius
![\\overline{AB}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BAB%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{AB}") draw an arc to cut this circle. Thus we get point C.  
4\) Reflect point C about
![\\overleftrightarrow{g}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverleftrightarrow%7Bg%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overleftrightarrow{g}") to get point E. Thus we get an isoceles
trapezium ABCE. Draw the perpendicular bisectors of two of the sides of
ABCE and obtain their point of concurrency J, the circumcenter of ABCE.
With J as center draw the circumcircle of ABCE which will be the outer
arc of the desired lune.  
5\) Similarly, find point K the circumcenter of ![\\triangle
CDE](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+CDE&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle CDE") and draw its circumcircle. This gives us the inner arc
thereby completing the construction of the desired lune.

From the construction (Figure 4) we can reconstitute the area of the
lune thus:  
![A\_l=A(ABCE)+A\_{cp}(AE)+A\_{cp}(AB)+A\_{cp}(BC)\\\\
-(A(CDE)+A\_{cp}(CD)+A\_{cp}(DE))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_l%3DA%28ABCE%29%2BA_%7Bcp%7D%28AE%29%2BA_%7Bcp%7D%28AB%29%2BA_%7Bcp%7D%28BC%29%5C%5C+-%28A%28CDE%29%2BA_%7Bcp%7D%28CD%29%2BA_%7Bcp%7D%28DE%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_l=A(ABCE)+A_{cp}(AE)+A_{cp}(AB)+A_{cp}(BC)\\\\ -(A(CDE)+A_{cp}(CD)+A_{cp}(DE))")  
Now from the construction (Figure 4) we can see that:  
![\\triangle ABJ \\cong \\triangle BCJ \\cong \\triangle AEJ \\sim
\\triangle CDK \\cong \\triangle DEK \\\\ \\therefore
A\_{cp}(AE)=A\_{cp}(AB)=A\_{cp}(BC)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+ABJ+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle+BCJ+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle+AEJ+%5Csim+%5Ctriangle+CDK+%5Ccong+%5Ctriangle+DEK+%5C%5C+%5Ctherefore+A_%7Bcp%7D%28AE%29%3DA_%7Bcp%7D%28AB%29%3DA_%7Bcp%7D%28BC%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle ABJ \\cong \\triangle BCJ \\cong \\triangle AEJ \\sim \\triangle CDK \\cong \\triangle DEK \\\\ \\therefore A_{cp}(AE)=A_{cp}(AB)=A_{cp}(BC)")  
and  
![A\_{cp}(CD)=A\_{cp}(DE)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bcp%7D%28CD%29%3DA_%7Bcp%7D%28DE%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A_{cp}(CD)=A_{cp}(DE)")  
If the length of the cord defining the cap is a and the angle subtended
by it is
![\\theta](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta") then we get the area of the cap to be:  
![A\_{cp}=\\dfrac{a^2}{8}\\dfrac{(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta))}{\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}\\\\\[5pt\]
\\therefore A\_l=A(ABCE) + 3 \\times
\\dfrac{(\\sqrt{2})^2}{8}\\dfrac{(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta))}{\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}
-A(CDE) \\\\ - 2 \\times
\\dfrac{(\\sqrt{3})^2}{8}\\dfrac{(\\theta-\\sin(\\theta))}{\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}
=A(ABCE)-A(CDE)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bcp%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7Ba%5E2%7D%7B8%7D%5Cdfrac%7B%28%5Ctheta-%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%29%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28%5Ctheta%2F2%29%7D%5C%5C%5B5pt%5D+%5Ctherefore+A_l%3DA%28ABCE%29+%2B+3+%5Ctimes+%5Cdfrac%7B%28%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%29%5E2%7D%7B8%7D%5Cdfrac%7B%28%5Ctheta-%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%29%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28%5Ctheta%2F2%29%7D+-A%28CDE%29+%5C%5C+-+2+%5Ctimes+%5Cdfrac%7B%28%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E2%7D%7B8%7D%5Cdfrac%7B%28%5Ctheta-%5Csin%28%5Ctheta%29%29%7D%7B%5Csin%5E2%28%5Ctheta%2F2%29%7D+%3DA%28ABCE%29-A%28CDE%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0

Now from the construction it clear that:
![A(ABCE)-A(CDE)=A(ABCDE)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28ABCE%29-A%28CDE%29%3DA%28ABCDE%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"A(ABCE)-A(CDE)=A(ABCDE)"), which is the area of the concave pentagon
ABCDE.

To find the actual area of this polygon and lune we need to do some more
geometry. From the construction it is apparent that:  
![\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle ABD \\therefore

Let ![\\overline{AD}=x \\; \\therefore

\\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}+x}=\\dfrac{x}{\\sqrt{2}} \\; \\therefore

Again from the construction we get:

The difference of the above areas is the area of the concave pentagon
ABCDE, which is the same as that of the lune, and shows the lune to be
squareable. Thus:

1.3576

One can also do the tedious calculation of the circumcircles using
Parameśvara’s theorem to get the outer angle of the lune as:
![161.12^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=161.12%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"161.12^o") and the inner angle as
![107.72^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=107.72%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"107.72^o"). These lunes briefly teased the ancients with the hope of
squaring the circle but it was merely a mirage.
