Continuing from my [previous
post](https://padmavajrablog.wordpress.com/2019/08/26/the-backdrop-to-purushottamashri-nilamadhava-a-very-brief-note/):A
likely template for how puruShottama was historically worshipped(when He
was the four-armed nIlamAdhava) can be found inserted in the
Purushottama Mahatmya of the nArada purANa. The rite mainly centres on
the deity of the aShTAkShari(8-syllabled) mantra of nArAyaNa,along with
shrI,puShTi(as a\~Ngas),vyUhas and avatAras invoked mostly in the
kavacha and nyAsa and the worshipper considering himself as one with
nArAyaNa,and then AvAhana,madhuparka,AchamanIya and other upAchAras
until the sending off the deity with various paurANika mantras.



Now to the main part of this article:This article will now describe the
evidences available from ritual and from other textual sources as to why
the wooden deity of jagannAtha was originally narasiMha.

### Ritual evidence

1.  In the navakalevara ceremony:The main deity to which the whole
    ceremony and pratiShThA is done to is nR^isiMha with profuse usage
    of the mighty anustubh in both its parts:pratiShThA and vanayAga.The
    vanayAga also features homas etc with not just the anustubh,but with
    the very long pAtAla nR^siMha(is this that famed sahasrAkShari of
    nR^isiMha)?,one of the longest AgAmika mantras I have seen. The
    mantras and nyAsas that specify the deity as jagannAtha,baladeva and
    subhadrA are added later and at the very end:Indicating their later
    characteristic in the ritual
2.  The original chalanti pratimA of jagannAtha is that post which is
    known as sudarshana these days. And it still performs this function
    on certain special occasions. There are two features that support
    the nR^isiMha identification.
    1.  General iconology: sudarshana figures in general,on their
        reverse,have nR^isiMha inscribed(a specimen is linked
        [herewith](https://imgur.com/JtQGVjU)). Hence nR^isiMha could
        easily(and with the ambiguity of a post as a chalanti pratimA)
        be reinterpreted as sudarshana
    2.  In the Puri temple, the chalanti pratimA of sudarshana Himself
        is nR^isiMha(implying a continuity with the identification of
        the earlier deity as nR^isiMha and by extension,the original
        wooden deity of jagannAtha).

### Textual evidence

1.  The puruShottama mAhAtmya of the skanda purANa notes that when
    brahmA consecrated the images with the mantrarAja,the wooden deities
    vanished and in their place appeared the furious narasiMha. brahmA
    then advises indradyumna to worship Him with the narasiMha anustubh.
    indradyumna then has a vision of [yoga-narasiMha with
    lakShmI](https://imgur.com/6vIYfXD) on His lap on 32-petalled
    lotus,with the serpent anantasesha(saMkarShaNa) forming the umbrella
    with His hoods.
2.  Older Odia sources in manuscript form by the deula-karanas of the
    Puri temple(one called the rAjabhoga is being referred to here) also
    corraborate a ritual practice of balabhadra being worshipped with
    the vAsudeva mantra(although presumably with the shaiva shrIkaNThAdi
    nyAsa,Iâ€™m not sure about this aspect),jagannAtha with the narasiMha
    anushtubh mantrarAja,and subhadrA with the bhuvaneshvarI
    ekAkSharI(single syllabled mantra). So this was the most likely
    practice before the second half of the 15th century in some
    circles(and presumably the ones who did the pUjA rituals of the Puri
    temple,if not the general public by that era),that jagannAtha was
    considered as narasiMha. By the time Gajapati Purushottamadeva(2nd
    half of 15th century) authored the gopAlArchanAvidhi,this manual
    treats jagannAtha as kR^iShNa gopijanavallabha,and no more as
    nR^isiMha.
