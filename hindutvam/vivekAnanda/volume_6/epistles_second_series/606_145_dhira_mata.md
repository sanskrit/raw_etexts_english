## CXLV

BAIDYANATH, DEOGHAR,  
*29th Dec., 1898*.

MY DEAR DHIRA MATA, (Mrs. Ole Bull)

You know already my inability to accompany you. I cannot gather strength
enough to accompany you. The cold in the lungs continues, and that is
just what makes me unfit for travel. On the whole I hope to improve
here.

I find my cousin has been all these years cultivating her mind with a
will, and she knows all that the Bengali literature can give her, and
that is a good deal, especially of metaphysics. She has already learnt
to sign her name in English and the Roman alphabet. It is now real brain
work to teach her, and therefore I have desisted. I am trying simply to
idle away my time and force myself to take rest.

Ere this I had only love for you, but recent development proves that you
are appointed by the Mother to watch over my life; hence, faith has been
added to love! As regards me and my work, I hold henceforth that you are
inspired, and I will gladly shake off all responsibilities from my
shoulder and abide by what the Mother ordains through you.

Hoping soon to join you in Europe or America, I remain, 

Ever your loving son,

VIVEKANANDA.
