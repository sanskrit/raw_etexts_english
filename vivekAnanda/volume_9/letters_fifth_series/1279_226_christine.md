## CCXXVI

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR, DIST. HOWRAH,

*15th June 1902*.

DEAR CHRISTINE,

Just now received your note. I am quite easy in my mind so long \[as\]
you live with Mrs. \[Charlotte\] Sevier at Mayavati. You know, anxiety
is one thing I must avoid to recover. I will be very anxious if you are
in Calcutta, at Baghbazar. I am slowly recovering. Stay with Mrs. Sevier
as long as you can. Don't come down with Margot \[Sister Nivedita\].

With love,  
VIVEKANANDA.
