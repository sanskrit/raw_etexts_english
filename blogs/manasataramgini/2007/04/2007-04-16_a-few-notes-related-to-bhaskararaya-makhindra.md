+++
We had earlier reconstructed a narrative on the illustrious bhAskararAya
makhIndra’s life using raghunAtha paNDita edition of the great man’s
biography by jagannAtha paNDita. jagannAtha paNDita’s clan hailed not
far from where we spent a good part of life and our mind wandered to
those regions. We have always felt a special feeling on entering the two
temples of the dreadful vinAyaka associated with them \[In the battle of
dashAnta we received aid from ekadanta and our prayoga bore full
fruit\]. raghunAtha paNDita states that there are 5 commentaries on the
lalitA sahasranAmam in vogue: 1) that of vimarShAnanda-nAtha the
disciple of vimalAnanda-nAtha. 2) that of vidyAraNya yati the student of
anantAraNya. 3) nArAyaNa bhaTTa’s commentary. 4) That of a certain
sha\~Nkara. 5) The saubhAgya bhAskara of bhAskararAya.

His biography is clear in stating that shiva-datta shukla, the
madhyandina brAhmaNa from Surat conferred on him pUrNAbhisheka-  
shivadatta shukla-charaNaasAdita pUrNAbhiSheka-sAmrAjyaH |
