<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">An Illustrative Story</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Containing Certain suggestions to be experimented by housewives for their redemption—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a joint family comprising a couple and their five sons and two daughters. The sons had already got married. Four of them had their children too. Both the daughters were unmarried. The youngest son got married only recently. His wife was not still brought from her father’s house. Thus, there were seven ladies in the family inclusive of the two daughters. Had they sincerely desired they could have efficiently carried on the domestic chores without any botheration but they were verily not on good terms with one another. They were jealous of one another and desisted from performing the household duties. Each of them desired to do the least of work and to relax as much as she could. Every now and then they exchanged hot words with one another. An atmosphere of disquietude and mutual conflict reigned over the house. In such an atmosphere the wife of the youngest son also came from her father’s place to this house. She belonged to a noble family. She was taught good manners since her childhood. She was embarrassed to find herself in such a tense atmosphere. One day she burst into tears when she found her sister-in-law and their mother-in-law quarrelling among themselves and began to offer silent prayers to God thus—O Lord, did you send me to this house only to witness all this. I know not what evil deeds had I done in my previous birth that I have been destined by you to be wedded in this family. I can’t stay here even for a day. I resent this day and night quarrel. While weeping she dozed. She distinctly heard someone consoling her with encouraging words—Dear daughter, don’t be nervous. You have been sent to this house only to set things aright. A girl like you was the need of the family.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The youngest daughter-in-law felt much comforted to hear these words. Her nervousness ceased to exist. She mentally drew up a plan of her role. She wanted to get at the main cause of the conflict. She came to know that the wives of her husband’s elder brothers, her mother-in-law as well as her husband’s sisters had made a settlement regarding division of work. The daughters-in-law would cook food by turn and the mother-in-law and the husband’s sisters would help them from outside. Turns were fixed for other domestic work as well but if by chance some one got ill, the other daughters-in-law found out some excuses not to discharge the duties of the sick one. They would charge her with making false excuses and raise many sorts of protests. Another cause of quarrel was that whenever some victuals were brought into the house from outside they would try to get the lion’s share of the best that was brought in. This would become the cause of discord among them and things would take such a turn that they started calling one another names. Sometimes they would fight over trifles. Sometimes if the son of one of the brothers fought with the other’s son, a scene would be created and their mothers would exchange hot words between them. Being an eye witness to all this the youngest daughter-in-law was much grieved. Then she heard the divine behest. She began to think of finding a means to end the quarrel. She thought God had given her that way, a good chance to render service. One day unnoticed by other she approached the wife of her husband’s eldest brother. It was her turn to cook food on that day. She said to her—“O sister, I am the youngest of all of you. It does not look proper that you cook food when I am there. Moreover you have to look after your children. No other work is allotted to me. What a nice arrangement would it be if you let me work on your turn? I shall feel so much obliged to you.” At first the elder one expressed her unwillingness for long and then said, “Dear bride, these are the days when you should eat freely and dress elegantly. You can blow up the oven after you are a bit grown up. Relax yourself for sometime and enjoy the life of a householder. All this you will have to do afterwards.” The youngest daughter-in-law said—“O elder sister, don’t disappoint me this way I fall at your feet. These are days for me to do something. If you make me a tenderling from now I shall turn out good for nothing afterwards. Surely I must have committed some mistake for which I am being deprived of my right” saying this she began to weep. Now the elder sister couldn’t put her off any longer. She allowed her to work on her turn. Thus, through prayer and persuasion she got, one by one the permission of all of the wives of her husband’s elder brothers to let her work on their turn. After taking charge of the entire work she became so pleased as if she had obtained a treasure. Every morning very cheerfully she would cook food for all and took her food after she would feed them all. Instead of feeling tiresomeness in doing so rather she felt very happy. Day after day she began to perform her duties with greater zeal. She would cook delicious dishes with swiftness. Very quickly she would prepare a number of dishes. Even if some guests paid visit to the house she was not excited. She fed them too with love for she thought it beneficial to do so. Noticing her strange dedication and sense of service everyone had a word of praise for her. One day her mother-in-law came to her and spoke thus—Darling, why did you do so? Why did you take everyone’s work on your shoulder. She replied very meekly—Revered mother, my parents have taught me that this body is sure to go to the dust some day so it should be harnessed as much as possible to the service of others. This alone is the best way it can be utilized. Service is the greatest  wealth. So my request to you too is that you should always encourage me to do this sort of work. The mother-in-law was amazed to hear such an answer. She supposed her to be some goddess for no human being could entertain such noble sentiments.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day the father-in-law brought home a number of sarees. He gave twelve sarees to each of the daughters-in-law for a year’s use. The youngest daughter-in-law took out two sarees from her own share and approaching the eldest sister-in-law meekly said to her—O sister, my father gave me a number of sarees when I left home. I can very well pull on with those sarees. Be kind to me and have these two sarees for your use. This will afford me a great pleasure and I shall be much grateful to you. The elder sister-in-law evaded this way and that but noticing her repeated insistence she had to accede to her request. Similarly through repeated requests she gave two sarees to each of her other sisters-in-law and mother-in-law as well and gave one saree to each of her husband’s sisters. This liberal dispensation of hers  also left a lasting impression on everyone’s heart. When the mother asked she said—Mother, I require your help and co-operation in this work as well. Like body itself these garments etc., are also ephemeral. Amassing of such things is an impediment to the attainment of spiritual welfare. On account of delusion, attachment etc., one gets entangled in these during one’s life time and if one remains engrossed in them even at the time of death one is obliged to be reborn in the species such as ghosts etc. So the best utilization of such things is in the service of others. Otherwise these are decayed after sometime, getting such an answer from her the mother-in-law was extremely happy and began to praise her very highly. During these few years the family grew richer. Father-in-law provided each of his daughters-in-law six ornaments which he had got made. The youngest daughter-in-law divided her share of ornaments also among her sisters-in-law and her husband’s sisters, leaving none for herself. On being interrogated she only said that “she had already many ornaments given by her father. Those are enough for herself.” Thus, through her saintly conduct, generosity she won a place of respect in everyone’s heart. All were highly pleased with her.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day finding a suitable opportunity she requested her oldest sister-in-law to allow her to cook the supper. She said—“When I am there, it is matter of great shame for me that you should put yourself to cooking.” When she was so speaking their mother-in-law came up there. With great eagerness she enquired of her eldest daughter-in-law what for she was insisting her. It was then that she came to know that the youngest daughter-in-law wanted to take upon herself the duty of cooking the supper as well. When she came to know that her youngest daughter-in-law was going to take upon herself the duty of cooking the supper also, she laughed and said—You must beware of this youngest sister-in-law of yours. She wants to deprive you of things that are of real benefit to you. Unable to follow the import of mother-in-law’s utterance the eldest daughter-in-law said—“Why do you say so mother-in-law? This youngest daughter-in-law of yours is saintly. She is by all means praiseworthy. How do you say such things for her? The mother-in-law said—“You do not follow me. By rendering service to us by providing us bodily comfort and supplying us garments and ornaments she is depriving us of our merits and spiritual wealth in turn which are helpful to us in seeking redemption. Can there be any deprivation worse than this? She told me the other day that through rendering service to others one’s inner senses stand purified and subsequently one becomes capable of achieving benediction. She also told me that by serving with a pure heart the members of one’s family in the kitchen one can attain spiritual welfare in a year. So O daughter-in-law, I intend to undertake the evening duties myself. I too have to attain spiritual welfare why should I after all be deprived of it.” The words uttered by the mother-in-law became an eye-opener to all. Now everyone was anxious about her own welfare. Whereas all of them used to shirk work and rather they felt easy and comfortable on their turns having taken by the younger daughter-in-law. Now contrary to it all of them took back their turn of cooking meal in the morning from the younger daughter in law. Whereas only a few days ago there was quarrel over work but now all of them began to discharge their respective duties with great zeal and interest. The plan of the youngest daughter-in-law got success.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the youngest daughter-in-law realised that none of them was willing to hand over the charge of the kitchen to her. She thought out another way to render them service. She thought to herself that the daily consumption of wheat flour in the family was about eight to ten seers which is totally purchased from the market. How good it would be if she got up early and ground the wheat herself. It would be profitable in many ways. The flour that is purchased from the market is made from old and worm-eaten wheat. It is mixed with particles of soil. Moreover, the flour that is ground in the mills is sapless and is harmful for health. My elder sisters-in-law of course have taken back the kitchen work from me. Now I should take up this job for my spiritual welfare. She immediately put forward the proposal before her husband. Arrangement for wheat was made at once. Purchase of flour from the market was stopped. In day time the youngest daughter-in-law set apart the strained wheat and the next morning having washed her face she started grinding the wheat. She was hale and hearty and her heart was full of zeal. She was in the habit of doing sustained work. In no time she could grind eight to ten seers of wheat. When the mother-in-law came to know about it she rushed to the youngest daughter-in-law and said—Daughter, have you devised a new method for spiritual welfare?” In choking voice she said—Mother, the elder sisters-in-law have taken back the work of cooking food. So I had to find out this new method for spiritual welfare. It involves more physical labour. So whereas by discharging duties in the kitchen one could attain spiritual welfare in a year, that can now be attained in six months through grinding wheat. Moreover it is doubly beneficial. Besides attaining spiritual welfare, sound health is also gained and further the body gets energy and stamina and it remains immune from diseases. Thus, pregnant women can have easy delivery and without unnecessary delay. The members of the family get a supply of pure flour which has favourable effect on their mind and health as well. For these reasons this work is quite beneficial to me. I hope you will endorse this work of mine.” Now the mother-in-law began to look upon her daughter-in-law as her preceptor. Whatever she uttered it seemed significant to her. She looked upon all her endeavours as sublime and herself tried to follow her footsteps. Whereas the daughter-in-law had began her work of grinding the corn in the morning at six on the very first day, the mother-in-law applied herself to the task at five the next day. To follow suit her other daughters-in-law started the work at four. Thus, whereas they all shirked work now gradually developed spirit of competition for engaging themselves in work. Each of them now wanted to discharge the greatest part of work. This was another success of the youngest daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the youngest daughter-in-law took upon herself the work of cleaning rooms and drawing water from the well. The servant would come in the morning to clean the rooms and draw water but she was through these jobs prior to his arrival. The mother-in-law further asked her what aim she had before her in doing these jobs. The daughter-in-law replied in a very sweet voice. Mother, by disclosing the secret of all those things, I get deprived of service. So I do not reveal the secret to you. Pray excuse me this immodesty of mine. The mother-in-law said—No more shall I interfere with your plan only explain to me the spiritual mystery of this work. The daughter-in-law said—“O mother-in-law, whereas by discharging duties in the kitchen one attains spiritual welfare in one year and by grinding flour in six months, one can attain it through drawing water in three months only for this work is harder than any of these works. It involves greater labour and trouble and risk of life as well. Soon mother-in-law also started sharing the work. Both had combined in it. When other daughters-in-law noticed this they said to their mother-in-law. You are now old enough to draw water from the well so you should not undertake this work. At this the mother-in-law said—“Do I not need my spiritual welfare? Rather being old I must try to attain it without the least delay.” Then it so happened that all the other daughters-in-law began to co-operate in the work. The youngest daughter-in-law took upon herself the task of scouring the utensils. Mother-in-law objected to it She said—this work will spoil your clothes and ornaments will undergo wear and tear. Whereas you will save rupees five as wages paid to the servant you will be losing rupees ten instead. At this the daughter-in-law said I take it for granted that doing so the monetary loss will be greater than the savings. But even though my clothes get spoiled, the fact is that harder and inferior the work is from the worldly point of view, the nobler and  more conducive it is to one’s spiritual welfare. I believe that through scouring utensils I shall be able to attain redemption in two months. And if God ever provides an opportunity to remove the urine and excreta of a patient the salvation can surely be attained only in a month. Certainly the feelings nourished by us should be the noblest—the feeling of complete selflessness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the words uttered by the daughter-in-law became gospel truth for the mother-in-law. She too started helping her in the scouring of utensils. The other daughters-in-law objected to it. She said—At least I can scour the pots used by my sons. Due to being old I have the greatest claim over the means of spiritual welfare. So your request in this regard cannot be conceded to. Consequently all the daughters-in-law employed themselves to the task whole heartedly. All the tasks were now being performed with great zeal. The turn of work assigned to each member was no more in practice. Whosoever got a chance readily applied herself to the task. Mutual love and goodwill were established among themselves. The house which had become the haunt of chaos and confusion now became the abode of abiding peace and happiness. Those who laughed at the sight of the ladies of the house quarrelling and fighting were astonished to look at their ideal behaviour. Citizens paid visit to that house to have a look at their behaviour. The ideal behaviour of the ladies did not fail to influence the gents much. They too had become lazy at the instance of the ladies. Noticing their ideal conduct they too became dutiful. Whereas the work at the shop remained in arrears it had now dwindled making the staff surplus. Whereas so far all of them shirked work now dashed forward to perform  jobs meant for others. Whereas at first they quarrelled to damn themselves to hell now they would quarrel for spiritual well-being. Needless it is to say that the good outcome was the result of the noble thoughts, goodwill and sincere efforts of the youngest daughter-in-law. Just as only one fish purifies the water of the entire pond so also a pious soul brings about the welfare of not only all the members of the family but also of a whole Mohalla, village nay even a city. Such is the marvellous effect of association of good people. All ladies—mothers and sisters ought to take lesson from this parable and take a vow of rendering service to others in a disinterested spirit and thus, seek welfare of their souls. Such a service soon paves the way for speedy salvation.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">King Gopāla Singha’s Singular Faith in God—Short History of His Ancestors</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The incident relates approximately to the year 775 of Vikram Saṁvat. One young man of Kṣatriya race was going to Purī along with his wife in order to visit the Jagannātha Temple. The wife was pregnant. Means of transport such as motor and trains etc., were not yet introduced, so they were going on the pilgrimage on foot. At night when they reached the village named Lau which falls under the police station Kotulpur, they knocked at the door of a householder in order to take rest there. The householder greeted him in such a way as if he were his very old friend and they were expectantly waiting for them till late in the night. The same night the wife of the Kṣatriya youth gave birth to a lovely child. This very child later on became the founder of the Malla state and that was why he was called ‘ di Malla’ (the originator of the Malla dynasty). The family in which he took his birth was the family of the Kṣatriyas. Malla was the title of the family. So the title they assumed was Malla and their territory was known as ‘Mallabhumi’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Only three days after the birth of the child its father left to Jagannathapuri where he died. Twenty days after the child’s mother also passed away in the very village Lau. Therefore, the host couple, the inhabitants of the village Lau, brought up the new born child. He was named Raghunātha. The economic condition of the child’s foster father was not sound. So in his boyhood days Raghunātha was sent to the village school conducted by PaṇÎita Manohara PaÛcānana who lived in the same village and Raghunātha began to graze his cows in lieu of the tuition fee. Raghunātha possessed sharp intellect and noticing this everyone predicted that he would grow up to be a promising lad. In a short time he completed his education at the school.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day Raghunātha went to the fields to tend the cows of PaṇÎita PaÛcānana but as he did not return by the noon so PaṇÎitajī was much worried. He went out in search of him. After a long search PaṇÎitajī found him sleeping being tired under a banyan tree. The sunrays piercing through the leaves fell on his face. Near his head sat a large serpent with his hood spread out like a coronet to protect him from the sunrays. PaṇÎitajī was astonished to see this and he at once concluded that he could not be an ordinary man rather he is some great man. After sometime the snake crawled away and PaṇÎita PaÛcānana returned home with Raghunātha.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Sometime after the passing away of the ruler of the village called Lau, it was Raghunātha who was verily made the ruler of that place. It was since then that Malla dynasty came into existence. When Raghunātha died his son Jaimalla acceded the throne. Having conquered Pradyumnapura he shifted his capital from village Lau to that place. In Pradyumnapura one king was succeeded by another. Khadgamalla was the twelfth among the dynasty of Malla rulers who having conquered it assigned it its present name Khadgapura. Jagat Malla happened to be the nineteenth ruler of this dynasty who founded a new capital in a forest nearby. He named it Viṣṇupura after the name of his family deity and began to live there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">The Bravery and Vaiṣṇavite Qualities of Malla Hambīra</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Centuries passed by, one king succeeded another. Every one tried in his own way to bring about an improvement in the capital. When King Akbar acceded the throne of Delhi, it was Malla Hambīra who ruled over Mallabhumi (the territory ruled by the Malla kings). Among the Malla rulers Malla Hambīra held the most prominent place. He was as learned and an efficient administrator as he was courageous. He got built two fortresses to defend the capital from Muslim invaders.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">During the reign of this very brave Hambīra the Pa¢hāna general Dāud Khān made an attack on Viṣṇupura. Horrible battle was fought. The Malla army fought the battle with the utmost valour and consequently being defeated Dāud Khān had to flee away. So numerous were the casualties suffered by the Pa¢hāna army in this battle that the battlefield was strewn all over with slain heads. That is why this place is known as MuṇÎamalaghata (the river side abounding with slain heads). This place is at present situated at the bank of a river at a distance of three miles from Viṣṇupura. Ruins of the fortress can still be seen there. (Many years ago a canon was unearthed on account of the soil being washed away by flood water. The same canon is at present preserved in front of premises of the criminal court of Vishnupura).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Brave Hambīra was a great warrior and a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. Since the reign of brave Hambīra the monarchs of Malla dynasty got themselves initiated in the Vaiṣṇavite discipline and began to spend as much money as they pleased for popularizing the Vaiṣṇavite discipline. In his early life the brave king Hambīra had not much knowledge of the Vaiṣṇavite discipline. Once śrī Jīva Goswāmī, śrī Kavirāja Kr̥ṣṇadāsa and other Vaiṣṇavas arranged to send a number of volumes pertaining to Vaiṣṇava cult loading them on three to four bullockcarts from Vrindaban to the territory of the Gaudas alongwith three Vaiṣṇavas named cārya śrīnivāsa, Narottama Dāsa and śyāmānanda. The route was very long. The three Goswāmīs were proceeding onwards facing the odds and ends of the journey. On the way when they went past Raghunathapur Maliada and reached Gopalapur they let loose the bullocks and began to relax themselves. Soon they fell fast asleep. Then the soldiers of the Vishnupura state mistaking them to be loaded with valuables escorted slowly those carts to Vishnupura.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On awakening when the Goswāmīs found the bullockcarts and the books missing they were much perplexed. So much so were they perplexed that śrīnivāsa putting on untidy clothes began to wander from village to village like a mad man in search of the lost volumes. Two of the Goswāmīs being disappointed returned to Vrindaban but śrīnivāsa wandering about from forest to forest and village to village arrived at the village called Devali at a distance of four miles from Vishnupur. There he met the gentleman named śrīkr̥ṣṇa Vallabha Cakravartī. śrī Cakravartī during his conversation with him came to know about the incident in details. He consoled śrīnivāsa saying—Don’t worry about them. Our king is very kind and righteous. When he will be properly reported about the incident he will arrange for their recovery.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Subsequently one day śrī Cakravarti along with śrīnivāsa went into the court of the king. When they reached the court śrīmadbhāgavata was being recited ceremoniously with religious fervour. The verses were being recited by Vyāsa Cakravartī the royal priest. He was expounding the verses occurring in RāsapaÛcādhyāyī but they were not being expounded in a proper way. So a discussion took place between him and cārya śrīnivāsa. The audience as well as the king politely begged śrī śrīnivāsa to recite and interpret the verses. śrīnivāsa was rendered helpless. He had to recite the verses. He started reciting verses and began to expound each verse in such a sweet and convincing tone that the audience was spell-bound. The king, the ministers and the courtiers—all were delighted to listen to his recitation. The king most devoutly complimented śrīnivāsa and placing the dust of his feet on his forehead desired to know his introduction. śrīnivāsa not only gave him his own introduction but also explained why he had paid a visit to the court.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On hearing what cārya śrīnivāsa had said the king became repentant of his own ill doing and with palms joined together said—Sire, it was indeed very fortunate for us to retain your books along with the carts otherwise it would have been impossible for us to avail ourselves of this visit of yours. I am blessed indeed to have a glimpse of your esteemed feet. My family and all the city folk are blessed. Now forgive the sinful act of me who am a mean fellow. All your volumes are intact. You can take them and award such punishment for my sin as you deem proper. Saying these words the king lay down at the feet of śrīnivāsa. cārya śrīnivāsa’s heart was filled with pity. He consoled the king and later on the third day of the dark fortnight of the month of ṣāÎha he initiated him in the divine formula—śrī Rādhā Kr̥ṣṇa. Since then the rulers of the Mallabhumi used to get themselves initiated in the Vaiṣṇavite cult.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The brave king Hambīra was a devout Vaisṇavite. On the request of the king, cārya śrīnivāsa remained in Vishnupur for sometime. After sometime king went to Vrindaban accompanied by preceptor śrīnivāsa and visiting all the places of pilgrimage there returned to the capital. After returning from Vrindaban the king started decorating the capital in accordance with the usages of the Vaiṣṇavite cult. He incurred a lot of expenditure in building four tanks called Yamunā, Kālindī, śyāmākua and RādhākuṇÎa. The two villages situated in the suburban areas of Vishnupur were renamed as Mathura and Dwaraka. Noticing all these things the poets and sages assigned Vishnupur a new name—‘Gupta Vrindaban’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king got carved by famous sculptors the image on the pattern of Kālā Cānda’ (the black moon) or the dark complexioned Kr̥ṣṇa and amid great rejoicings got it installed. He could not build the temple of ‘Kālācānda Deva’ as designed by him but it was later on built by his worthy son, Raghunātha Siṁha. This ‘Kālācānda temple stands even today. According to the inscription on the temple, this temple was built in 1656 A.D.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">After the death of brave Hambīra his son Raghunātha acceded the throne. Like his father he too was courageous, expert in warfare and intelligent. śāhaśujā, the Nawab of Rajmahal, having summoned Raghunātha into his court on some pretext made him his captive. At last in order to test his bravery and courage the Nawab after making him sit on a ill-tempered horse asked him to ride upto a certain place and then come back. The horse was too haughty but keeping him under control with great adroitness he made it run back to the starting point. This pleased the Nawab so much that he set Raghunātha at liberty and made friendship with him. The Nawab bestowed on him the title ‘Siṁha’ as a mark of respect. Since then ‘Siṁha’ became the family title of the kings of Malla dynasty. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Taking leave of the Nawab, king Raghunātha Siṁha set out for Vishnupur. He went on and on and reached a village. He was an orthodox Vaiṣṇavite and would dine at the house none else but that of a Brāhmaṇa and would not even drink water without first sipping the <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Caraṇodaka’</span> with basil leaves. Finding out the house of a Brāhmaṇa named Dharaṇīdhara he guested at his house. Dharaṇī was extremely poor still he duly entertained him at his house. He entertained Raghunātha with whatever was available and offered him food. In spite of his poverty the Brāhmaṇa was very devout. He neither did any unjust work nor ever told a lie. In that Brāhmaṇa’s house there was an idol of śrī Rādhākr̥ṣṇa and it was named Madana mohana. The king was spell-bound to have a look at the unique appearance of Madana mohana never seen before. He proposed to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> to let him have Madana mohana in exchange for ten thousand rupees. The Brāhmaṇa burst into tears at the very thought he would have to part with Madana mohana for the sake of money. Continuously weeping like a small boy the Brāhmaṇa refused to part with Madana mohana even though he paid any price for it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While sleeping in the temple at night Raghunātha in his dream received injunctions of the Lord. Accordingly he quietly took up Madana mohanajī into his arms and wrapping Him in a sheet he went out of the house. His hands, feet as well as heart were trembling. The king had never done such a thing in his life, that was why his entire body was shaking. He was dazed but after all that was the order of his own deity. Stealthely closing the doors of the house he started from there. After two or three days he reached Vishnupur. After telling the queen all about Madanamohanajī with due deference he placed śrī Madanamohanajī in a corner of the interior apartments of his palace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dharaṇīdhara, the Brāhmaṇa, got up in the morning and went out to pick up flowers as usual. On returning when he opened the doors of the temple he was surprised to find that neither śrī Madanamohanajī nor king Raghunātha was there. The Brāhmaṇa was much grieved and began to lament loudly. He became sure that it was none else but Raghunātha who had made off with Madanamohanajī. Having thought this, the grief-stricken Brahmaṇa, as he was, went out of the house in search of Raghunātha and Madanamohanajī wandering about at many places. Dharaṇīdhara, the Brāhmaṇa, at last reached Vishnupur one day. There he went around from door to door for about a month but Madanamohanajī was not to be found anywhere. Then having made up his mind to give up his own life he reached the river bank. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There an old woman stopped him from throwing himself into the river and knowing from him the detailed account said—“Mind, you won’t reveal to anybody. The ruler of this land has brought the idol of some deity from somewhere and has hidden it at some secret place in the interior apartments of the palace. Go there and find out whether it is your Madanamohanajī or not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Brāhmaṇa was much pleased to get the clue from the old woman and presented himself in the king’s court. The king did not fail to recognize the Brāhmaṇa and greeting him with reverence and devoutness duly entertained him and made offer to give him money and gems or anything he desired. With tears in his eyes the Brāhmaṇa said­—“O king, I am indeed poor and want to remain as such. What shall I gain by acquiring money and wealth? Of what use are these things to me? You have brought here my Lord Madanamohana. Please return it to me. I entreat you with supplication. I yearn to see my Lord with my own eyes. Please let me have a vision of my Lord once.” The king was in a fix. Seeing no way out the king requested him to stay there for a few days and assured him to let him have His vision after three days. The Brāhmaṇa was much delighted to hear the king’s words and raising both hands upwards blessed the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One night the Brāhmaṇa saw in his dream that Madanamohana was patting his head. He said—“I am pleased with your devotion. You need not worry yourself and return home. The ruler of this state is also devoted to Me. He has developed indifference for the state affairs for My sake. I am bound by his devotion and so I must stay here. But I shall regularly pay a visit to your house and you will get an opportunity to have my vision everyday. I shall place the thorns of tamarind flowers on the throne for the deity. By finding them there you will be convinced that I visit your place everyday.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> When it was morning the king himself went to invite the Brāhmaṇa and with humility said to the Brāhmaṇa—“O Brāhmaṇa, do not take ill of my doings. Be kind to come to my house. I shall let you have the <span class="char-style-override-6">Darśana</span> of Madanamohanajī. And then you may do whatever you deem proper.” On hearing the words of the king, Dharaṇīdhara was puffed up with joy. He walked in the footsteps of king Raghunātha. Going to the inner apartment of the palace Dharaṇīdhara had the <span class="char-style-override-6">Darśana</span> of Madanamohanajī and no sooner did he have His Darśana than he lost his senses and was rendered speechless. Tears streamed down from his eyes and they rendered his entire chest wet. He gazed at the Lord with unwinking eyes. The icon of Lord Madanamohana was very attractive and was exquisitely adorned. After bringing Madanamohanajī to Vishnupur king Raghunātha Siṁha forsaking all his duties remained with him as a rule and adorned him with different embellishments in various ways. The Brāhmaṇa in astonishment looked on and on at the idol of the Lord. His eyes were unwinking. Then for a long time he devoutly made obeisance and chanted hymns.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king repeatedly prayed, fell at his feet and with palms joined urged him to stay at Vishnupur. He offered him land, to build a house for him, so much so that he desired even to entrust to him the work of offering worship and adoring Lord Madanamohana but the Brāhmaṇa would not consent to stay at Vishnupur at any cost. With joined palms he saluted the Lord many times and recalling to his mind the injunction of the Lord received in the dream he proceeded from there leaving the Lord behind in Vishnupur and casting a yearning look at the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once on the ceremonial occasion of Rathayātrā even after yoking hundreds of horses and elephants and despite offering prayers with reverence and devoutness, the chariot of śrī Madanamohanajī did not budge an inch. The reason was that an old woman who was coming from Wirasim to have the Darśana of Rathayātrā was fagged out and fell on the way. <br/>The chariot would not move without granting her the Darśana. Only when she was brought in a palanquin, the chariot did move on.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Forced labour by King Gopāla Siṁha</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the lapse of a few generations Gopāla Siṁha who belonged to the holy lineage of this very Raghunātha, succeeded to the throne in 1712. He was a thorough Vaiṣṇavite. He would practise <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa</span> of the divine names at every hour of day and night. He remained unconcerned with the state affairs and with rosary in his hand for the purpose of repeating the divine names he would hold conversation with the devotees on religious topics and would study the volumes dealing with Vaiṣṇavite cult. If he happened to come across a Vaiṣṇava sage or monk he would bring him to the court and very devoutly entertain them and serve them. King Gopāla Siṁha who was verily a devotee had bestowed on the Vaiṣṇavas a lot of land free of tax. Their successors are still enjoying that bestowed land.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once the king passed orders that every employee of the state will be duty bound to repeat the divine name ‘Hari’ at least once at the fixed time everyday. He who would not do so would be punished. Consequently all bought rosaries and began to tell the beads everyday. After some time the maid servants and the ladies of the inner apartment also began to tell the beads everyday. Subsequently one day the king passed orders that every citizen of the capital will have to tell the beads everyday. The old, the young boys, girls and women—all will have to tell at least one round of the beads of the rosary everyday without fail. Since the orders were passed by the king everyone had to tell the beads willy-nilly. Everyone had to be at his or her beads at least once daily. There was no chance of evading the order on this or that pretext for the king had deputed a number of spies to ascertain this and the king himself at times in disguise went about to keep watch. There was of course no ban of time. One had to be at one’s beads at any time during the day for no restriction was placed with regard to time. If people desired to take food and the food was not yet cooked or if there was some delay in serving the food people would at once sit outside the kitchen with a rosary and start counting the beads. This act of king Gopāla Siṁha was certainly very praiseworthy. One’s true benefactor and friend is one who directs him to God.</p>
<p class="Shlok">तुलसी सो सब भाँति परम हित पूज्य प्रान तें प्यारो।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जाते होय सनेह रामपद एतो मतो हमारो॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is my considered opinion that he alone is one’s supreme benefactor in everyway he alone is worthy of honour and dearer than even one’s life who directs one to the revered feet of the Lord—says Tulasī.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This act was as if holding one by the neck and making one drink the nectar still it aroused indignation among some people and they termed it as the forced labour by Gopāla Siṁha which later on became an adage. This adage is popular even now in the neighbourhood of Bankura and Vishnupur. In case one does not get good wages or profit even after working earnestly one ironically refers to the work as Gopāla’s Begāra. If some one shirks work his master refers to his work as Gopāla’s Begāra (work done without due return).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">Invasion at Vishnupur and Mass Chanting of Divine Name</span><span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bhāṣkara PaṇÎita, the Marā¢hā general was seeking an opportunity of invading the Malla territory but he did not dare attack in view of the strength of the Malla armies and their skill in war-fare. But having come to know of the indifference of Gopāla Siṁha towards the management of the state affairs and thinking it to be an opportune time for making an attack, he attacked the state of Malla king with a very huge army. The Malla king, Gopāla Siṁha, little knew about this invasion. Nobody was conscious of the event. The Marā¢hā army arrived at Mundamalaghat and took its position. There was a fortress on which cannons were arrayed. According to the old warfare the enemies had to bring this fortress under control before entering the territory ruled by the Malla king or they had to accept their defeat and retreat. The Marā¢hā soldiers had arrived at Vishnupur after plundering many villages of Murshidabad, Dhaca and the state ruled by Malla kings.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was noon time then but at the command of the general, a troop of soldiers rushed forward and reached near the fortress. But it was greatly dismayed to see a number of cannons arrayed on the fortress walls and its advance became very slow. It was fortunate for the Marā¢hā general that no soldier was present inside the fort at the time. The soldiers present in the fort moved about at their own free will otherwise Bhāskara PaṇÎita would have to accept his defeat then and there. The Marā¢hā soldiers made an advance. Meanwhile one of the gunners deputed in the fort saw him. He at once entered the fort and started firing the cannons. Hearing the sound caused by explosion other soldiers of the Malla state rushed in and started firing the cannons. Gun powder began to explode profusely from the mouths of the cannons and the Marā¢hā soldiers started falling dead one after the other. There were only fifteen soldiers present in the fort at that time. They noticed that the Marā¢hā soldiers had drawn nearer they did not come within the easy range of the cannons. Then they started firing the guns and one of them ran and informed their general about the developments.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On getting the information of the invasion by the Marā¢hā general Bhāṣkara PaṇÎita, king Gopāla Siṁha sent a troop of soldiers towards Mundamalaghat. A terrible battle was fought. The Malla army was not large enough but it began to fight without caring for the loss of lives. A number of Marā¢hā soldiers were killed but they were at last successful in capturing the fort. Then the rest of Malla army retreated and returned to the court.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being pleased with the victory in the battle Bhāṣkara PaṇÎita advanced with his army towards Vishnupur. But as night drew on, the general ordered the army to encamp by the roadside though they were still midway. The place where Bhāṣkara PaṇÎita had ordered the encampment lies about the place where the criminal and civil courts of Vishnupur are situated now that is why this place is even now called Marā¢hāÎāngā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The army men present in the fortress rushed to give informations to the king. On knowing that the Marā¢hās are advancing towards the chief city, the king ordered his subjects to take shelter inside the fortress with their money and valuables as well as the members of their families. The public was horrified. All took shelter in the fortified place with whatever they possessed along with their children. Some people not caring for their money and valuable possessions ran inside the fort only to save their lives.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On hearing the news of the defeat of his army king Gopāla Siṁha despondently thought that there was no way out. He then faithfully advised all the men present in the fort to resort to the chanting of the divine name Hari. Though even at that moment the number of the trained armymen present in the fort was no less than forty thousand and it was not an easy job for the Marā¢hā general to defeat them, yet the king did not take into account this thing. He started chanting the divine names alongwith the citizens of the capital. The fortress resounded with chorus of the name of Hari. The tired armymen of Bhāskara PaṇÎita began to take rest at night.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But the general of the Malla army was not at rest. There was also a Santhālī army in the state they were very trustworthy and courageous. They were deputed on all sides to guard the inner apartment. Malla generals made solemn pledge to that they won’t allow Marā¢hā advance even a single feet towards the fort even at the cost of their lives. With that purpose in view without waiting for the king’s orders troops of armymen were deputed on all sides of the fort for the sake of defence of freedom of the Malla territory and during the whole night the big cannons were fed with gun powder to make them ready for action. The stock of riches was hidden at secret places in the regal palace. The king was not in the know of all these precautions, he was only loudly chanting the name Hari alongwith the subjects in the fort.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As soon as it was morning the Malla armies started shelling with their cannons. The Marā¢hā army faced them. The Marā¢hā soldiers tried to cross the ditch round the fort in order to launch an attack on the fort but as there was proper arrangement for supply of water into the trenches through large tanks, the water in the trenches was flowing forcefully like the water of a river in spate so they found it difficult to cross it. Having arrayed the cannons on the fortress thousands of soldiers were lying in wait. The strong iron gate of the fort was closed. This convinced the Marā¢hās that a large army was definitely present in the fort. But they had grown covetous on account of the conquest of many lands. Moreover their ego had also inflated. They were puissant and courageous warriors too. How could they then accept defeat  at the hands of Malla army? With great difficulty they could anyhow cross the trench and gave an alarm for battle by firing the guns. When the Malla soldiers noticed the Marā¢hā soldiers crossing the trenches they started shelling with their cannons simultaneously and at the same time started firing with guns. The Marā¢hā soldiers had to suffer casualties on account <br/>of shelling with cannons and firing with guns and their dead bodies began floating in the water of the trenches. Not a single soldier of the troop of the Marā¢hā soldiers which had descended into the water earlier, survived. The Marā¢hā general commanded another troop to descend into the water but only a few soldiers were able to cross the water and all of them were killed before they could approach the <br/>gate. Thus the Marā¢hā general attempted thrice but thrice he failed. The Marā¢hā soldiers continually sustained casualties.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King Gopāla Siṁha was even now chanting the divine name Hari inside the fort. All were distressed and in a heart melting tone were chanting the sacred name of the Lord wholeheartedly. They were completely unaware of the happenings of the battle. Common people were passing their time inside the fort under the stress of terror. People were hearing the sound produced by cannons and guns but they did not know about the outcome of the battle. It seemed as if verily a stream of devotion inspired with a pathetic call for mercy had steamed forth. Auspicious was the outcome of the prayer offered enmasse. The ocean of causeless divine grace streamed forth profusely and it began taking its due course.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">Shelling with Cannons by Madanamohanajī and Victory Over the Enemies</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being engaged in continuous fighting both the armies got tired. Having crossed the trenches the Marā¢hā soldiers entered into the forest to take rest. Meanwhile the Malla soldiers got an opportunity to furnish their cannons with gun powder and new troops of soldiers began to pour into the fort. To their surprise the Malla soldiers suddenly noticed a rider coming out of the royal palace and rushing forward with such a speed that the dust raised by the hoofs of the horse was spread all over so that it was not clearly visible who the rider was. Suddenly the Dal Mādal cannons began to thunder and soon started shelling the forest areas where the Marā¢hās were relaxing themselves like countless raindrops during the rains and consequently countless Marā¢hā soldiers were falling dead. In the twinkling of an eye half of Bhāskara PaṇÎita’s army was doomed to death. Finding himself helpless the Marā¢hā general accepted his defeat and with rest of the army he began to retreat. Finding an opportune time the Malla soldiers came out of the fort and making them the target of their attack violently chased them. The Marā¢hā army was disorganized and the soldiers ran hither and thither to save their lives. The Marā¢hā general, Bhāskara PaṇÎita alongwith some of the soldiers hid himself in the forest but they could not find the way out in the forest. After wandering for a number of days and hiding themselves they fled away to a place called Candrakona in the district of Medinipur. Thus the soldiers of the Mallabhumi humbled the pride of the invincible Marā¢hās.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As regards the operation of the Dal Mādal cannons the general belief is that it was śrī Madanamohanajī, the Lord, who himself had operated  them. Being satisfied with the prayers offered by the king the Lord himself rushed to operate them in order to save Vishnupur from the enemies. Consequently the Marā¢hās being defeated fled away whereas the Malla soldiers were bubbling with joy. The soldiers began to march freely on the roads of Vishnupur, the capital and the citizens began to offer presents of various <br/>kinds to the soldiers. This is a burning example of the marvellous outcome of the belief in the Divine Being and of his being well-disposed to those who are His humble servant.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-7">Proper Administration of the State during the Reign of Gopāla Siṁha</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A French tourist named Abirenyal visited Vishnupur during the rule of king Gopāla Siṁha. After making a tour of the Malla state he highly praised the arrangements for the defence of the state, the straight behaviour of the common people and their sense of hospitability to their guests. He writes that none could usurp the money, valuable possessions and the freedom of the people of Mallabhumi. There were no cases of theft or robbery in the state. If a foreigner ever visited the Malla state the king took on his shoulder the responsibility of his protection and himself bore the expenses needed for guesting him. As a rule an assistant was deputed to remain with the foreigner. He would escort him to the places in the state he preferred to visit. None had to spend even a paisa for this. The people of the state never committed acts of violence nor did they harm anyone. All were so upright and so scrupulous about the fulfilment of their duties that if anyone ever got a bag containing money he would deposit it with the king and the king would announce on all sides at the beat of drums that the person who had lost his bag of money could take it from him. Such was the pattern of administration  during the reign of Gopāla Siṁha.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the death of Gopāla Siṁha his son Caitanya Siṁha succeeded the throne. Like his own father he was an orthodox Vaishnavite and was dedicated to the exposition of <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span>, recitation of religious books and the chanting of the Divine Name round the clock and was greatly devoted to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇas</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that the idol of śrī Madanamohanajī which is now installed in the temple of śrī Madanamohana at Bagh Bazar in Calcutta is the very idol which was brought to Vishnupur from the house of Dharaṇīdhara, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> and which was continuously worshipped by king Raghunātha Siṁha, Gopāla Siṁha and others.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" xml:lang="en-US">Conclusion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The popular belief in regard to the ‘Dal-Mādal’ cannons of Gopāla Siṁha, the king of Vishnupur, is that when the hostile enemies laid siege to Vishnupur on all sides and the soldiers deputed in the fortress became disappointed, it was Lord Madanamohana who balancing the Dal-Mādal cannons on both side of a steed came out of the fort and emitting shells on the hostile enemies began to move around revolving fire. The shells volleying from the cannons exterminated a large part of the enemy forces and those who survived fled away. Then the Lord rode back into the fort and unloading the cannons from the back of the horse at the tank called Lalbandha, Himself entered His own temple.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The general of the enemy forces was much astonished and he began to wonder how many of such cavaliers would there be with them when only one of them was capable enough to defeat their army. Terrified as he was, he along with his own counsellor and following the horse and arriving at the temple of Gopāla Siṁha, the king of Vishnupur, surrendered themselves to him. They fell at the feet of the king and asked for his forgiveness. King Gopāla Siṁha asked—“What sort of guilt are you talking about?” At this the general of the enemy forces related in detail how it came to be and how only one of his cavaliers a brave warrior, by shelling utterly destroyed his army and defeated them. He expressed his astonishment at the number of such brave persons in his army. King Gopāla Siṁha said—“We have no such cavalier on our side who would balancing the cannons on a horse back take part in the battle.” “It is an incident witnessed by all” said the general. Both the cannons are lying on either side of Lalbandh and the horse can be seen at the gate  in the premises of the temple and as far the rider is concerned, I myself have seen him entering the canopied hall.” The king was much surprised to hear this.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Both of them went from there to the canopied hall and when the general of the enemy forces looked at the large idol he at once exclaimed—“It was none else but He” when king Gopāla Siṁha examined the apparel he found it was wet with sweat. Shedding tears with a heart full of pity, king Gopāla Siṁha said—“I am indeed too much covetous of the state. For this insignificant work of mine you had to take the trouble of going into the battlefield. Consoling the general of the army and sending him off with due respect he said—“Indeed blessed you are for you have had seen the Lord in embodied form. The miracle you have witnessed is only the divine sport of the Lord Madanamohana who is ocean of compassion and well disposed to his servants and those taking refuge in Him.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One of the two cannons can be seen even now near the Lalbandh tank outside the rampart built around and it is said that the other one lies hidden under the bagh. These two cannons were named ‘Dal Mādal’. Only God knows whether these two cannons were already available in the state or were they brought by the Lord himself but the cannon which is still found is twelve and a half feet long. Its circumference at the base is about eight feet and it is about one foot at the mouth. The examination of the cannon reveals the fact that there was no device available at the time for moulding such a large cannon besides the metal of which it is made is quite smooth and extraordinary as if it were made of some alloy. Though centuries have passed yet it has not been the least rusted. Another strange thing is how the two cannons so heavy were loaded on the back of the horse and how they could be operated. This makes one believe that those cannons were brought by the Lord himself. Nothing is impossible for the Lord. He can make even the impossible, possible. What is the fact only God knows.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The logicians say that it is merely a flight of fancy. It is mere foolishness to think of getting victory over the hostile forces merely by chanting the divine names and the belief that the Lord defeated the enemies by operating the cannons is quite illogical. Moreover it is clearly a violation of one’s duty to chant divine names <span class="char-style-override-6">en masse</span> at a time when enemy forces have drawn so near.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">From the point of view of duty, things stand crystal clear. Those who do not faithfully trust on God and take a false resort to the divine name and desist from their duty on account of fear or on the pretext of chanting the name try to hide their feebleness, their work is certainly foolish and undesirable and their negligence of duty becomes quite obvious and eventually their attempts turn out fruitless but as regards those who are endowed with living faith, it is neither a fantasy nor whimsicality nor even undesirability. For them it is a sterling truth. A number of such instances are found in the ancient as well as the latest books where Lord himself has done what His devotees were to do. Barbareek had declared that it was the discus of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa which was at work in the battlefield. It was for the sake of Jaimalla that  the Lord fought with his enemy and defeated him. There are other stories which also uphold this truth. According to the declaration made by the Lord in the Gītā that He brings full security and personally attends to the needs of His devotees, it is but natural for Him to do so. What is required is utter dependence based on full faith. Mahātmā Gāndhī was certainly an intelligent man. He also writes at one place—I would like to say, without any hesitation that the divine name Rāma sung collectively in a chorus wields greater power, than military force and is many times more effective than that. Still for the common people what is safe and desirable is that one should constantly remembering God discharge all his duties with promptness. It involves both faith in God and performance of duty as well. Those who are endowed with faith should make their faith stronger and more firm through the study of this historical incident.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Dedication of Actions to God and the Secret of Divine Compassion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If relating all living beings, objects, actions and the propensities of mind with God, a practicant carries on his spiritual practice his heart will be filled with zeal, equanimity, cheerfulness and peace and remembrance of God all the time. By doing so supreme love and reverence for God is developed and God can be realized easily. Whatever exists belongs to God; I too belong to Him, God permeates everyone and everything (<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> 18.46). Therefore to serve everyone is to serve God. Whatever I am doing is being done by divine inspiration and for the sake of God alone; God is supreme beloved and supreme benefactor—entertaining such thoughts at heart the practicant will never feel dejected while discharging domestic duties or the duties at the shop or the duties pertaining to a religious body. If these duties are regarded as divine and himself as His servant, then his zeal, cheerfulness, and composure go on increasing day after day. If there is no increase in them one should seriously think over as to what could be the cause behind it. On reflecting he will come to the realization that reverence and faith are lacking. In order to remove these deficiencies the practicant ought to take refuge in God and he should pray to God piteously and should try to realize virtues, glory, truth and secret of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The work of preaching <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> is obviously a work done for His sake, there is not the least doubt about it.

<p class="TEXT-English">To perform divine work or to carryout His behests is nothing but service to the Lord Himself. In fact one is sure to attain happiness and composure if such a work is done by deeming it as a service to the Lord. If such feelings are not aroused one should conclude that one did not take it as service to God. If a man taking a great soul as such obeys his commands assuming them as his service his heart brims over with joy. Then there is nothing to feel surprised at if one attains ecstatic joy and peace in rendering service to God. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a person undertaking the work of popularizing the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> is not endowed with remembrance of God, happiness, zeal, love and peace he must try to find the cause thereof and if one finds out some deficiency one should try to remove it by taking resort to the divine grace. The divine compassion is boundless for everyone without exception and we are deprived of the bliss and peace simply because we fail to realize even one hundredth part of it. But notwithstanding that it does not come into our realization, we should ever assume that divine compassion is there for us. By practising this way it may come within our realization later on.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To bring home this fact of divine compassion a parable is being narrated here. It is as follows—A <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy was studying in a degree college aided and managed by a state. His parents would always instruct him thus—“the king of this state is a scholar of a high order. He is <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> and a highsouled man. He is selflessly loving and merciful to all and he is inordinately kind to us.” If we pass away you should not be worried for the king is more kind to you than us. In this respect he had full faith in the advice given by parents. In due course of time his parents breathed their last but the boy did not grieve. His classmates asked him—“How is it that no mark of grief is visible on your face although your parents are dead? Who will bring you up now? The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy said—“Why should I grieve? For our honourable king is there who has greater love and mercy for me than even my parents. The king is a devotee of high order and a realized soul. I depend on him alone.” Knowing the fact that the boy had such an inordinate love and reverence for the king the principal was highly amazed. The principal was the member of the state council. One day when the meeting of the council was being held he too was present there. On that day the king said—“Tell me if there are orphaned boys in the state. If there are any they ought to be brought up by the state.” Many members of the council suggested the name of the same <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy. At this the king with the consent of all arranged for proper food for the boy from the state exchequer and ordered that his mud built house should be rebuilt with bricks. As far as his education was concerned it was already being provided free by the state.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After sometime when the king’s men were pulling down his house in order to build it anew, the classmates of that <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy rushed to him to inform that his house was being demolished by the king’s men. The boy was much pleased to hear this and exclaimed—“How gracious is the king to me!. I suppose he is going to build my house anew after pulling down the old one.” The head teacher was much astonished to hear his statement and began to reflect thus—“What a firm faith does this child have!  How unshakable is his reverence for the king!”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When for the second time the head teacher took part in meeting of the council, the king proposed saying—“I have become old. I have no issue. Whom should I make the crown prince then? Who could be deserving for the post of the crown prince?” At this the head master told him that the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy excels all in virtues, conduct, learning and nature. He was loyal and had boundless reverence for you. This statement of the headmaster was supported by other members as well unanimously he was declared to be the crown prince by the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The next day the king’s minister and some other high officials went to the house of that <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy. Seeing all of them approaching he complimented them and asked them if he could be of any service to them. The officials said that the king was indeed very gracious to him. The boy told them that he was already aware of this fact that the king had been gracious to him and that was why all of them were gracious to him. The officials said that they were his humble servants and were desirous of his grace. The boy said—“Do not put me to shame by saying so. The fact is that I am your humble servant. I know it well that His Majesty is very kind to me.” The officials said—He is even more gracious than you imagine him to be. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy asked—Has the king arranged for my marriage? Not only has your marriage been arranged extreme grace goes even beyond that— replied the officials. The boy further asked—“Has the king given me a few villages as rent free grant?” The  officials said—“It is too insignificant. You can’t even imagine how gracious he is to you.” At this the boy requested them to tell in what respect he was gracious to him. They told him that the king had made him the crown prince and as such they craved for his kind favour.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On being interrogated by the boy if it was a fact they said that it was. Then he was much surprised for he could not even imagine that the king would be gracious to such an extent. The king, however, designated only the boy as crown-prince. But our universal Lord has the post of crown-prince for everyone of us. He shapes everyone in His own image. God is such a Lord. He who has given you human form reserves crown princeship for you. It will be your foolishness to spurn it. Such is the divine grace that we are drenched with the showers of love and bliss. Now if you cover yourself under the umbrella you are depriving yourselves from that blessedness. The loss of faith or disbelief is termed as lack of reverence. This has been referred to here as shielding oneself under the umbrella. We must entertain living faith that there is abundant divine grace upon us. God cherishes deep love for us. If you desire to shake hands with him you won’t find Him far, he will appear to you even eager to embrace you—what is expected of you is firm belief, you ought to entertain reverence in your heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Spiritually the symbolism involved in the parable should be interpreted thus—the king who is a great soul endowed with learning symbolizes none but God. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya</span> boy is symbolic of the practicant endowed with reverence. The parents symbolise the God-realized souls who sermonize. The classmates represent the co-practicants. The arrangement for the fooding of the boy represents in the worldly sense as availability of favourable circumstances and the act of demolishing the house should be taken to represent the onslaught of unfavourable circumstances and the looking upon by the boy of both the circumstances as the king’s undertakings directed to the well being should be taken to represent the fact of remaining pleased at all events when one regards every thing as a divine dispensation directed to one’s welfare. The dependence of the boy on the king taking him to be friendly disposed to him and his reverence and trust he placed in the king should be taken to represent the practice of total self surrender to God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this parable we should derive the inference that the divine compassion for us is actually far greater than what we assume it to be. We cannot conceive of the compassion He has for us. If we realize that compassion, we can also experience such bliss and rapture which would cross all limits and this would naturally transport us to the state of self-forgetfulness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So whatever falls to our lot, be it sought for by us, unwillingly thrust upon us or thrust upon by others we should regard it as the divine dispensation directed to our welfare regarding all our actions as being performed for God’s sake and reflecting on God thus all the time we should remain in a blissful state.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Through the practice of such devotion to the Lord the practicant’s heart is filled with delight; he feels horripilation and tears roll down his eyes; his heart is filled with delights, his tongue is cloyed with joy and voice gets choked. But when through continuous practice a man reaches absolute perfection—attains God-realization then he transcends the state of amazement, joy and happiness and attains the state of blessedness and ecstatic joy. Just as when we fry a ‘Kacaurī’ in a cauldron it tosses about and makes a special type of movement so long as it remains uncooked but its movement becomes less frequent than before when it starts frying but when it is fully fried it ceases to move and becomes static so also so long as the practicant’s practice remains immature he is activated by amusements derived from the practice <br/>and he feels thrilling sensation, tears roll down his eyes and his throat gets choked but when the practice attains maturity the effervescent joy and other impurities gradually cool down and when it reaches the climax of maturity the impurities such as amusement, joy and happiness being cured, the practicant enjoys abiding peace and having constantly fixed in mind with God attains the Supreme Being who is the embodiment of Bliss and Peace.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">The Secret of Charity</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In giving donation what counts is the selfless motive of the donor and not the price or number of objects given away. To gift a thing disinterestedly to a deserving person—one who needs that thing and not expecting any return, is the best charity. To offer food to a hungry man and water to a thirsty man in a selfless spirit is <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> charity. A story is told about saint śrī Ekanāthajī that once he was going to śrī Rāmeśvaram from Prayāga carrying water by means of Kāvara to offer it to the Deity. On the way he noticed at one place an ass writhing due to thirst for want of water. He took pity on him and made him drink a little water. It helped the ass regain his senses to some extent. Then he made him drink the whole of it at short interval. The ass got up and went his way. His fellow travellers argued to themselves that the water collected at Triveṇī (the confluence of the three rivers) was simply a waste and the aim of the pilgrimage remained unfulfilled. Then Ekanāthajī laughingly said—“Bretheren, you hear times and again that God pervades all created beings still you think like an insane person. My adoration here has reached śrī Rāmeśvaram. Lord śaṅkara has verily accepted my offering of water.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is a story of a money lender who was always devoted to performing <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛas</span> etc. So liberally did he give donations that even he was not left with anything to support himself. Then his wife said, “In the neighbouring villages lives a rich man who buys merits. So go to him and bring some money by selling some of your merits so that we might pull on any how. Reluctantly he agreed to go there on account of the repeated requests of his wife. His wife baked four Capātīs and gave them to him to be eaten on the way. He set out and approached the city where the rich man lived. There was a tank at the place. Thereafter attending the call of nature and bathing himself when he sat down to eat, a bitch came up there. She had littered in the forest. She and her young ones had nothing to eat for the last three days. On account of heavy rains she could not go to the city leaving her young ones behind. Seeing the hungry bitch he offered one of the Capātīs to her. She ate up the Capātī. Then he gave her another Capātī which too was eaten by her. Thus he gave all the four Capātīs to the bitch one by one. The bitch appeased her hunger by eating the four Capātīs. Thus having forgone his food he approached the rich man. Approaching him he told his intention of selling his merits. The rich man said that he should come in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the wife of the rich man was inordinately devoted to her husband. He asked his wife, “A man has come up who wants to sell his merits. So tell me which of his merits is the best one worth being purchased.” The wife said—Only that merit is worth being purchased which he has earned this day by feeding the hungry bitch with the four Capātīs while he was sitting on the bank of the tank for that is the best of all the merits earned by him during his life. Saying ‘Alright’ the rich man came out.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The man came to the rich man on the appointed time and said—“Which of my merits would you like to purchase?” The rich man said—“I want to go in for the same <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> that you have earned today. I haven’t performed any <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> today. Certainly I didn’t have money. How then could I have performed <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> said the man. At this the rich man said—“I want to purchase the same merit that you have earned by offering the four Capātīs to the bitch while sitting on the bank of the tank today.” The man asked—“How could you know about it when there was no one around?” The rich man said—“My wife is exclusively devoted to me and it was she who told me all about it.” Then the man said—“Very well, you may take the desired merit. But tell me what price you are going to pay for it.” The rich man said—“I shall give you pearls and diamonds equal in weight to the Capātīs.” The man consented to it and as agreed upon by him and making four Capātīs roughly equal in weight to his Capātīs, put them on one of the scales and put pearls and diamonds etc., on the other but in spite of putting a number of them, the scale containing the Capātīs  did not rise from the ground. At this the rich man said—“Bring to me more bags containing jewels”. When the man noticed this miraculous effect of his merit he told the rich man that he would not sell out this merit. Just then the rich man said—‘As you please.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thereafter the man left that place and gathering some pebbles and pieces of glass at the bank of the same tank where he had fed the bitch with Capātīs and tying them up in a piece of cloth returned home. On reaching home  he handed over the small bundle to his wife saying that they would open the bundle after taking meal. Saying so he went out. The wife however, desired to see its contents. When she opened the bundle she found in it diamonds, emeralds and rubies etc., shining brightly. She was much pleased. After sometime the businessman came home. She asked—From where did you get so many diamonds and emeralds? The businessman said—“Why are you jesting?” The wife said—Surely I am not jesting. I have opened the bundle and seen with my own eyes. It is full of innumerable precious diamonds and emeralds. The money-lender said—“Fetch it here and let me see it. She brought the bundle, opened it and put it before him. He was astonished to look at them. He considered it to be the effect of that meritorious work. Then he narrated in detail what had happened during his travel.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is intended to convey to the readers is that the donation given to a distressed person who is in dire necessity of it, multiplies innumerable times. By the grace of God even pebbles and pieces of stones turn into diamonds and emaralds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, charities given to the destitute, the distressed and sick men are highly remunerative. It is good to offer even a handful of gram to people adversely affected by such calamities as flood, drought or earthquakes etc. The sacrimonious bestowing of gold, ornaments and <span class="char-style-override-6">Tulādāna</span> (the giving away of grains, fruits and clothes etc., equal in weight to one’s weight of the body) is not so much merit-giving as the meagre gifts bestowed in times of catastrophes. So everyone ought to serve the orphans, the crippled and the lame, sorrow-stricken people and the widows etc. To bestow gifts on the undeserving people is <span class="char-style-override-6">Tāmasika</span>. The bestowing of gifts to earn fame and honour is <span class="char-style-override-6">Rājasika</span> for these bring about fall in life. Honour and self-esteem may be found pleasing for the time being but ultimately they do cause decline. The desire for honour and praise must be given up but if censure is the lot, it should be considered favourable. śrī Kabīradāsa puts it thus—</p>
<p class="Shlok">निन्दक नियरें राखिये, आँगन कुटी छवाय।</p>
<p class="Shlok">बिन पानी साबुन बिना, निरमल करै सुभाय॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“We should seek proximity of those who scan our actions. A cottage should be built for them in the very courtyard for they purify our conduct even without using soap and water.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For our benediction censure is preferable to honour and praise. For a spiritual seeker honour and praise are but sweet poison and censure and dishonour are nectarine. So the fault-finders should be looked upon with respect but no blameable sinful act should be done. Evils and evil conduct entail great danger. So these must be dismissed from the mind altogether. One should reveal one’s evils and conceal one’s virtues. These days men conceal all their evils and declare themselves as the ocean of virtues although they have none. This straightway leads them to hell. Hence the desire for honour and fame must be discarded from the heart altogether. If we enjoy popularity in the world without deserving it, it means we are doomed. God distances Himself from such men as aspire for fame, honour and recognition for such aspirations lead them to downfall. Self- esteem and praise should be regarded as horrible as the horrible hell and honour and goodwill should be regarded as offensive night-soil. Such are the injunctions of the saints.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It should be borne in mind that the charity bestowed on deserving man is beneficial to both of them whereas the charity given to the undeserving man is harmful to both the donor and the donee. Just as a boat made of stone sinks alongwith those sitting in it, in the same way the undeserving donee enters the hell alongwith the donor.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One thing more should be borne in mind in connection with the bestowing of gifts. A rupee given away as a gift by a poor man is more significant than lakhs of rupees bestowed as gift by a rich man for the gift of even a rupee involves a great sacrifice on the part of a poor man. Justice is verily dispensed by the Lord. Had it not been so the poor would not have attained salvation. There is a story pertaining to this subject. As certain king set out on a pilgrimage with his subjects. On the way they found a man lying naked and shivering with cold. One of the people accompanying the king was a Jā¢a by caste. He offered one of the two <span class="char-style-override-6">Dhotīs</span> (loose lower garment usually worn in India by males) to the naked man which helped to save his life. The Jā¢a had now only one <span class="char-style-override-6">Dhotī</span> to wear. When they went ahead they found the sunshine quite unbearable but they noticed all along the way the clouds were offering them shade. The king thought that it was by virtue of his merits that the clouds were offering them shade along the way. Thereafter they stayed at a certain place in a forest. When they left the place a certain sage asked—“O king, do you know by whose virtue have the clouds been yielding shade all along the way?” The king could not answer decisively. Then the sage said—“All of you leave this place one by one. The man on whose stepping forward the clouds keep offering shade must be considered the meritorious man by the virtue of whose merit this unusual phenomenon is taking place.” At first the king left that place and then the subjects followed suit one by one but the clouds remained where they were. Then the king enquired as to who is left behind, the attendants found that a Jāta was lying asleep there. They awakened him and brought him before the king and then the clouds also began to move along with him. Then the sage said—It is indeed the effect of the merits of this meritorious person. The king enquired of him what meritorious deed he had done. On being repeatedly asked he said—I haven’t done any meritorious work but certainly on the way I had offered one of my <span class="char-style-override-6">Dhotīs</span> to the naked man who was freezing with cold.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At this the sage said to the king—You donate large amount of money but as you are very wealthy person so your sacrifice can’t be equal to the sacrifice made by one who gave away one of his two <span class="char-style-override-6">Dhotīs</span>. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Thus, after fully grasping the secret underlying the donation one should give such donations.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Riddance from Egotism and Mineness through Knowledge and Devotion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The greater wealth a man possesses, the larger family he keeps, the greater is his bondage. Suppose a man owns hundreds of factories and mines, hundreds of industrial concerns and shops and has a large family as well but if one of his factories or mines catches fire or if a concern fails on account of heavy losses suffered by a factory or if a kith and kin or one’e wife or son dies or if one suffers a loss of twenty lakhs of rupees on account of some firm becoming insolvent or if a factory or a building is requisitioned by the government—any of these events is distressing to him due to his sense of mineness in the assets. Apprehensive of such event the poor fellow feels burning sensation due to worries day and night. But if a man possesses nothing, what loss would he suffer? The less one has the less is his loss. For example if there is a sage, sage in the true sense, and has a <span class="char-style-override-6">KamaṇÎalu,</span> a cottage built of straw, a few sheets to lie on or to wrap himself with and if someone makes off with his <span class="char-style-override-6">KamaṇÎalu</span> or clothings he gets these things from someone else. If the cottage is reduced to ashes he takes shelter elsewhere. He is not so much worried about these things. But those who have amassed enough of wealth, have greater sense of mineness with the assets they possess and the greater the attachment the greater is the sorrow at their loss.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In case there is no possessive spirit neither the man rolling in riches nor the man who has scanty wealth has a cause to be sad. But in case the wealth possessed is enormous the chance for attachment is also greater. Nevertheless king Janaka, Aśwapati and others in spite of owning enormous wealth and their magnificent kingly state always remained happy for they had no feeling of attachment at all. They were never grieved even at the loss of property etc. Really speaking egotism and ‘My’ ness is the root cause of every sorrow. Hence one should give up egotism and ‘My’ness for one’s blood relations, assets and one’s own body.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Identification with individual body as I am a human being, I am a sage, I am a householder, I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa,</span> I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Kṣatriya,</span> I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Vaiśya</span>­—is egotism whereas the myness with the body which finds expression in such statements as—she is my wife; he is my son, this is my property, this is my cottage, this is my <span class="char-style-override-6">KamaṇÎalu,</span> this is my deer-skin and so on is termed as myness. Feelings of both sorts are awefully prejudicial to the interest of a practicant and as such, such feelings must be discarded. Simultaneously with the extermination of such feelings, the sense of pure ego as it is strictly termed is also annihilated eventually. According to great aphorism as ‘I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span>’ which indicates ‘I ness’ in <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Brahma’</span> is pure ego. According to the doctrine of non-dualism to entertain such feeling is an excellent practice one can undertake but acknowledging it as an excellent practice we do not consider every one eligible to undertake its practice and that is why we do not advise everyone to undertake its practice. Only he is entitled to undertake its practice who is really devoid of egoism in the body and who has established himself in <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma.</span> So long as one is centred in the body, it is difficult to undertake such practice and to attain the supreme state through it. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्लेशोऽधिकतरस्तेषामव्यक्तासक्तचेतसाम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अव्यक्ता हि गतिर्दु:खं देहवद्भिरवाप्यते॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> XIII 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Of course the strain is greater for those who have their mind attached to the unmanifest, for identification with the unmanifest is attained with difficulty by those who are centred in the body.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Brahmabhµuta’</span> or say one who is identified in <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma,</span> such practice is an easy one. Such men can easily attain <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma.</span> The Lord Himself declares—</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम्॥ </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“For to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogīs</span> whose mind is perfectly serene, who is sinless, whose passion is subdued and who is identified with <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma,</span> the embodiment of truth, knowledge and Bliss supreme happiness comes as a matter of course. The sinless <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> thus uniting his self constantly with God easily enjoys the eternal Bliss of oneness with <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the next verse God describes the meditation practised by one seeking identity with God—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शन:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> VI. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> who is united in thought with the all pervading infinite consciousness and sees unity everywhere, beholds the Self present in all beings, and all beings as assumed in the Self.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The practicant practising meditation has to pass through two stages one being assumed one and the other, the real one. In the assumed state the practicant sometimes seeks identity with God and sometimes he is centred in the body. But when one truly identifies oneself with God one is never centred in the body. He constantly remains identified with <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma.</span> The following verse is a criterian.</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मौपम्येन सर्वत्र समं पश्यति योऽर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुखं वा यदि वा दु:खं स योगी परमो मत:॥ </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, he who looks on all as one, on the analogy of his own self, and looks upon the joy and sorrows of all with a similar eye—such <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> is deemed the highest of all.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whoever stands true to this trial, whoever passes this test attains the eternal bliss. This fact has been referred in verse (VI. 28) of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> quoted above. After attaining absolute perfection, man should look to the touchstone provided in verses 24 and 25 of chapter XIV of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā.</span></p>
<p class="Shlok">समदु:खसुख: स्वस्थ: समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चन:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“He who is ever established in the self, takes woe and joy alike, regards a clod of earth, a stone and a piece of gold as equal in value, is possessed of wisdom, receives the pleasant as well as the unpleasant in the same spirit and views censure and praise alike. He who is indifferent to honour and ignominy, is alike to the cause of a friend as well as to that of an enemy, and has renounced the sense of doership in all under-takings, is said to have risen above the three <span class="char-style-override-6">Guṇas.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The inherent marks of a God-realized soul stated above are the means worth being resorted to by a practicant so keeping these in view the practicant should undertake his practice by establishing himself in the final state of a God-realized soul, and should be made to cultivate those marks in himself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-8">‘अहं ब्रह्मास्मि’ </span>(I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span>) is also a means to that end. The feeling behind the expression is I have no relation with my physical body. Identification with the body and the myness in things and beings related to the body, is a mere phantom or dream. I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma,</span> the embodiment of knowledge and Bliss; I have no relation with this body and the world and thus developing the feeling of identity with the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span>—the embodiment  of knowledge and Bliss and entertain such thoughts that there is nothing except Him and the total obliteration of the body and the world from the mind—is what is termed as non-dualistic practice. Such thoughts should be entertained all the time during such practice.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When there is complete absence of egotism in one’s body and absence of myness in objects relating to one’s body no doer or agent remains existent in the body and with the dislodgement of doership the sense of attraction and aversion cease to exist and wishes and desires etc., lose their existence and according to verses 24 and 25 of chapter XIV of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> referred to above one attains an attitude of complete equanimity in feelings of joy and sorrow in objects like gold and earth and in dualities like honour and ignominy, censure and praise which are caused by others. In that event one does not entertain such feelings as <span class="char-style-override-8">‘अहं ब्रह्मास्मि’ </span>(I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span>—the Absolute) for one verily is transformed into <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> (the Absolute) and from viewpoint of <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> there is no body and world. Then the question of mutual relationship does not arise. In that state, relationships cease to exist or in other words all relationships stand completely severed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In discipline of knowledge the pure ego as is denoted in great sentences like ‘I am <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span>’ eventually goes away, then one ceases to have myness for everything and such a man realizes God—the embodiment of truth, Consciousness and Bliss. The Lord Himself tells thus—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ब्रह्मभूत: प्रसन्नात्मा न शोचति न काङ्क्षति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सम: सर्वेषु भूतेषु मद्भक्तिं लभते पराम्॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या मामभिजानाति यावान्यश्चास्मि तत्त्वत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ततो मां तत्त्वतो ज्ञात्वा विशते तदनन्तरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> XVIII. 54-55)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Established in identity with <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> (who is truth, consciousness and Bliss solidified) and cheerful in mind, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāṅkhyayogī</span> no longer grieves nor craves for anything. The same to all Beings, such a <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> attains supreme devotion to Me. Through that supreme devotion he comes to know Me in reality, what and how great I am and thereby knowing Me in essence forthwith enters into My Being.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Alongwith egotism his feeling of myness too is eradicated. At first when identification with God is sought one does hatch ego in himself viz., he is not the body (matter) but that he is beyond the three evolutes of Nature, formless and ever the supreme spirit—knowledge and Bliss solidified that is he ceases identifying himself with the body and begins to identify himself with the Supreme Being. But later on when through the practice stated above he attains the supreme knowledge known as <span class="char-style-override-6">Parā Bhakti</span> then he merges with <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Giving up egotism and mineness a practicant practising <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga</span> of Devotion should pursue his practice. I am the body and the kinsmen and assets related to the body are mine—such pride is detrimental to the practice. Man must not be the least proud of his caste, his status in society, his stage in life, his family, intelligence, strength, virtues and character etc. To arrogate oneself thus—I am a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span>, I belong to a high caste, am learned, am a sage, am a devotee endowed with learning, am a great soul, am intelligent, virtuous and have righteous conduct, have a large family, my wife is exclusively faithful to me, my son is devoted to his parents, I own big factories, a number of houses, none is so rich, strong and virtuous as I, none has righteous conduct and excellence like me—is a great impediment to the practice and entails great risk as well.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides these the egotism and mineness of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> type are also given up in the long run. To claim that ‘I am a devotee or a spiritual practicant’ is ego of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> type. In following line from the <span class="char-style-override-6">Rāmacaritamānasa</span> is an example of this type—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अस अभिमान जाइ जनि भोरे।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मैं सेवक रघुपति पति मोरे॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Such pride as Raghupati (Lord Rāma) is my master and I am His humble servant, should not even inadvertently depart from my mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same way—“I belong to the Lord and He is exclusively mine” is mineness of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> type. This type of <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika </span>egotism and mineness disappears in the long run. So a practicant should not entertain even such a feeling of pride as—“I am a spiritual practicant and a devotee of the Lord but as people call him a devotee, a great soul, a righteous person, so should he conform himself to the same standard of conduct as is expected of him by the people. And this was what Yudhiṣ¢hira had said in reply to <span class="char-style-override-6">Yakṣa’s</span> question. After he had precisely answered all the questions asked by <span class="char-style-override-6">Yakṣa,</span> the <span class="char-style-override-6">Yakṣa</span> asked him—“O king why do you want Nakula to come back in life in preference to Bhīmasena and Arjuna who are so powerful?” At this Yudhiṣ¢hira said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">धर्मशील: सदा राजा इति मां मानवा विदु:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वधर्मान्न चलिष्यामि नकुलो यक्ष जीवतु॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata vana</span>. 313. 130)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O <span class="char-style-override-6">Yakṣa,</span> as for me people always hold the opinion that king Yudhiṣ¢hira is a righteous person so I shall not deviate from the path of <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span>. Let my brother Nakula come back to life.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">My father had two wives—Kuntī and Mādrī. I being Kuntī’s son, am alive and if Mādrī’s son Nakula is revived then each of them shall have a son. I wish to be impartial to both of them for it is my <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span> to be so.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So a practicant should entertain such feelings that he is neither a devotee nor a practicant of high order, he is simply trying to be so. People do regard him as such but in fact he has many drawbacks. He should try to conform to the ideal before him. He should entertain such thoughts that “I am the servant of His servant.” I am a servant in mere name. He cannot arrogate himself even to be His minion, Hanumānjī expresses his sentiments accordingly—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकु मैं मंद मोहबस कुटिल हृदय अग्यान।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पुनि प्रभु मोहि बिसारेउ दीनबंधु भगवान॥</p>

<p class="Shlok">जानउँ नहिं कछु भजन उपाई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">सेवक सुत पति मातु भरोसें।</p>
<p class="Shlok">रहइ असोच बनइ प्रभु पोसें॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Rāmacaritamānasa Kiṣ.</span> 2. 1-2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the first place I am dull-witted and deluded, wicked at heart and ignorant, to crown all my master who is benefactor of the humble and is no other than the almighty Lord Himself, has forgotten me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Although, my Lord, I have many faults let not the servant be cast into oblivion by the master. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Jīva</span> (embodiment) O Lord, is deluded by your <span class="char-style-override-6">Māyā</span> and can be redeemed only by your grace. On top of it I swear by the Hero of Raghu’s line, I know neither adoration nor any other means (of pleasing you). A servant depends on the master and child on its mother and both remain free from anxiety for a master needs must take care of his servant.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Hanumānjī meets Bharata the latter asks him—</p>
<p class="Shlok"><span>को तुम्ह तात कहाँ ते आए।</span> </p>
<p class="Shlok">मोहि परम प्रिय बचन सुनाए॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Who are you, my beloved friend and whence have you come? You have given me a most pleasing news.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then Hanumānjī replies thus—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मारुत सुत मैं कपि हनुमाना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नामु मोर सुनु कृपानिधाना॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">दीनबंधु  रघुपति कर किंकर।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">RāmacaritamānasaUttara.</span> 1. 4-5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am the son of wind-god a monkey, Hanumān is my name. I am a humble servant of śrī Rāma (the Lord of Raghus) the benefactor of the meek.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So one should reflect thus—“I would be fortunate enough if I am counted even as a humble servant of Lord’s servants. That is to say that Hanumānjī is verily the Lord’s servant and it would be very fortunate of me if I am reckoned only as his servant far less of being counted as the Lord’s servant. But in fact I am undeserving; I am simply trying to be one. I feel ashamed at being hailed as a devotee’’ such are the thoughts entertained by the devotee but his outward behaviour conforms to the opinion held of him by the people. He supposes that he has to enact as an actor strictly according to the opinion people hold about him and this he has to do for the sake of winning the pleasure of the Lord but certainly he must not be the least proud of being a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya,</span> a <span class="char-style-override-6">Vaiśya,</span> a sage, a householder, a virtuous and saintly person, a devotee, a man endowed with excellence and so on and so forth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am a devotee but a certain person is not so”—if one entertains such feelings of self-assertion, it proves to be a hindrance in one’s spiritual practice. God is solely my master and I am his only servant—instead of entertaining such a thought one should conceive that God is the sustainer of all and He is the universal Lord and as such He is my Lord as well. It is still better if one entertains the thought that everyone is the Lord Himself or He pervades everyone so the service rendered to all is the service rendered to God.</p>
<p class="Shlok">सो अनन्य जाकें असि मति न टरइ हनुमंत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मैं सेवक सचराचर रूप स्वामि भगवंत॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Rāmacaritamānasa Kiṣ.</span> 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“And he alone is exclusively devoted to Me, who is steadfast in his conviction that he is the servant and the Lord, manifested in the form of the whole animate and inanimate creation is his master.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such a feeling that—I am everybody’s servant, I am insignificant, everyone is my master, I am merely the dust of their feet—is an excellent one and by entertaining such a feeling even the <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> form of egotism vanishes in due course of time. One realizes that one is non-existent, it is God alone that exists He becomes oblivious of himself. Only the awareness of God remains existent—egotism and mineness cease to exist altogether and subsequently all of his activities are automatically performed through His promptings. His actions become instrumental. Just as a wire puller makes his puppets dance at his sweet will so also all his activities are motivated by God. A puppet is certainly devoid of inner senses but in spite of being vested with inner senses the devotee acts like a wooden puppet. As against the puppets, he being especially vested with mind and intellect, through his mind he reflects on God and in his intelligence there is a firm conviction regarding the omnipresence of God. This alone is true devotion and this alone is true self surrender to God. Just as the puppet remains unaffected by its victory or defeat so also should a practicant remain unaffected by the fruit of any sort of practice. He should surrender to God not only all his actions and their fruit but should also surrender his own self. The Lord declares in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> thus—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये तु सर्वाणि कर्माणि मयि संन्यस्य मत्परा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्येनैव योगेन मां ध्यायन्त उपासते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेषामहं समुद्धर्ता मृत्युसंसारसागरात्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भवामि नचिरात्पार्थ मय्यावेशितचेतसाम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> XII. 6-7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“On the other hand, those depending exclusively on Me, and surrendering all actions to Me worship Me (God with attributes), constantly meditating on Me with single-minded devotion, these Arjuna, I speedily deliver from the ocean of birth and death their mind being fixed on Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such a devotee notwithstanding that he performs all his  duties renounces the sense of doership and by the grace of God realizes him—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वकर्माण्यपि सदा कुर्वाणो मद्‍व्यपाश्रय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मत्प्रसादादवाप्नोति शाश्वतं पदमव्ययम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> XVIII. 56)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-6">Karmayogī,</span> however, depends on Me attains by My grace the eternal, imperishable state even though performing all actions.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa exhorts Arjuna to follow that example—</p>
<p class="Shlok">चेतसा सर्वकर्माणि मयि संन्यस्य मत्पर:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">बुद्धियोगमुपाश्रित्य मच्चित्त: सततं भव॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gīta</span> XVIII. 57)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Mentally resigning all your duties to Me and taking recourse to <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga</span> in the form of even-mindedness, be solely devoted to Me and constantly give your mind to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through constant practice in the aforesaid manner man takes complete refuge in God and then the sense of egotism and mineness ceases to exist altogether and he attains God and then according to verse 13 and 14 of chapter XII of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> he verily becomes God’s devotee endowed with knowledge.</p>
<p class="Shlok">अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्र: करुण एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहङ्कार: समदु:खसुख: क्षमी॥</p>

<p class="Shlok">मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who is free from malice towards all beings, friendly and compassionate, rid of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, balanced in joy and sorrow, forgiving by nature, ever contented and mentally united with Me, nay, who has subdued his mind, senses and body, has a firm resolve, and he surrendered his mind and reason to Me—that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the touchstone for testing the God-realized soul. In this way a devotee practising spiritual practice perceives God in the embodied form with his eyes and through purified intellect having received the knowledge in essence, of the Absolute merges into His being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even the Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञातुं द्रष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च परंतप॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">मत्कर्मकृन्मत्परमो मद्भक्त: सङ्गवर्जित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्वैर: सर्वभूतेषु य: स मामेति पाण्डव॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> XI. 54-55)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Through single-minded devotion however, I can be seen in this form (with four-arms) nay, known in essence and even entered into, O valiant Arjuna.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Arjuna, he who performs all duties for My sake, depends on me, is devoted to Me has no attachment and is free from malice towards all beings, reaches Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus while taking recourse to the path of knowledge, conceiving oneself as supreme viz., that one is the embodiment of the integral <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> and while taking recourse to the path of devotion and conceiving that one is the servant, the servant of the servant, a humble minion and the dust under the feet, nay only the dross. Thus even thinking the lowest of oneself one has to exterminate the sense of ego in both cases. At first one has to annihilate the ego in respect of worldly objects such as one’s country, caste, status in the society and stage in life etc., subsequently the pure ego born of claiming oneself to be a devotee or a spiritual aspirant, is shaken off. On the path of knowledge all sorts of egoism is removed through the knowledge in essence whereas on the path of devotion all sorts of ego is removed by the grace of God. Through the practice of either of these practices when the sense of egotism and mineness ceases to exist, his actions take place without any agent, therefore they are mere gestures of action not actions. Then actions become inaction. And both types of practicants attain God. The ultimate fruit of either of them is invariably the same. Please, consult verses 54 and 55 of Chapter XVIII and verses 54 and 55 of Chapter XI of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But his outward conduct conforms to the conduct of a <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> aspirant of a high order. From the worldly point of view whatever he is—a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahmacāri,</span> a sage or a householder—his mimicry of these is always excellent. There is no inherent evil in him. He never puts his masquerading to shame. To illustrate this a short story is being given below.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a masquerader. He wore faces with the utmost care and skill and would not let the slightest discrepancy creep in. One day he approached the king and with a view to get reward from him he enquired as to what sort of mimicry he would like to witness. “You should bring before me the mimicry of a lion” replied the king. The mimic said humbly, “Please do not ask me to bring before you the mimicry of a lion. This mimicry is indeed very terrible. When I shall appear in the guise of a lion I shall try to imitate the nature of a lion and I won’t allow any drawback or inefficiency on my part. I would not put it to shame. If by chance I commit some offence for the sincere performance of my masquerade, you should  be good enough to condone it.” The king said, very well. The offence committed by you for the sake of your art shall be pardoned. Bring before me the mimicry of a lion.” This news spread throughout the city. As a result all the citizens became alert.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Next day guising himself as a lion roaring and thundering he crossed the market place and reached the king’s court. The citizens and the courtiers rendered dumb, looked at him in amazement but one of the king’s young sons proud of being a prince, thrust a twig in lion’s rectum. Then the lion struck the prince exactly in the manner of a lion with his front legs which resulted in the death of the prince. The lion roared and went back.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The members of the royal family and the courtiers were much grieved and excited at the death of the prince. The next day the mimic too presented himself undisguised. He expressed his intense grief and humbly spoke thus—“O king, this was the reason why I requested you not to ask me to present before you the mimicry of a lion. It is a grievous fault on my part that I inadvertantly became the cause of the prince’s death. Now I do stand before you simply as a mimic. Now you may reproach me and punish me as much as you wish. But at that time I was playing the role of a lion and was trying to behave like a lion. Now tell me how can a lion bear a twig being thrust into his rectum? I never make my mimicry an object of mockery. If I make a mockery of my mimicry, I can neither be successful in my mimicry nor shall I live honourably. I am a worshipper of God. By His grace I get success in my mimicry and I come  out victorious. The king was listening to all this. But his heart was full of extreme grief and excitement yet being bound by his own words the king could do nothing. The mimic asked—O King, is there any other mimicry that you wish to be presented before you? At this the minister who was grieved at the death of the prince, said—bring here the mimicry of sage śukadevajī, the great soul. The mimic went away and after a fortnight appeared in the guise of a great soul endowed with rare scholarship like that of śrī śukadevajī and seated himself on a sandy mound in the northern outskirt of the city. Soon words went about the city that a high souled man endowed with great learning is sitting on the sandy mound. On receiving this news crowd gathered there to have a look at him. When the minister heard this news he said to the king.” O king as far as I can guess it is that very mimic who has appeared in such a guise. I was greatly shocked at the death of the prince and the grief persists till now with this purpose in view I had asked him to bring to us the mimicry of śukadevajī. It is very difficult indeed to mimic him. If this mimicry of him is put to ridicule he can be awarded punishment. So accompany me to have his <span class="char-style-override-6">Darśana</span> so that we may distract him from his mimicry by tempting him.” After this conversation both approached the place. The king and his minister saluted him and placed at his feet bags full of gems and gold coins. Taking the least notice of the bags at once he rose up from his seat and made his way towards the forest. The minister followed him. When they arrived at a lonely place the minister whispered into his ear—I know very well that you are a mimic and you have appeared in the guise of śukadevaji. Those bags contain money worth lakhs of rupees. So insist that you should accept all that money. Both of us will share the money by halves afterwards. The mimic who had appeared in the guise of a <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> turned a deaf ear to him and went into the forest displaying unconcernedness. Then the king and the minister returned to the city.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Two days later that mimic came to the regal palace again and said—“O king, how did you like the mimicry of śukadevajī? “Very well” said the king. Then the mimic further asked—“Which mimicry should I display now? A barber who was devoted to the king was sitting nearby. He reflected that it was he who had murdered the prince. Its a great crime and he must be duly punished.” Reflecting thus he said—“Display the mimicry of a lady exclusively devoted to her husband.” The king and his minister also assented to it. The mimic gladly accepted the proposal and went home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After a few days he noticed a dead body floating on the surface of a river and approaching the river bank he carried it home. Dressing it up as if it were her husband and embelishing himself with all the sixteen types of bedecking disguised himself in the form of a lady exclusively devoted to her husband and preparing a decorated bier for her husband amid great rejoicings and trumpeting of musical instruments took out a procession to march towards the funeral ground. This news at once spread throughout the city, thousands of men and women accompanied the dead body to the funeral ground. When the minister heard this news, he said to the king—“He is the same mimic who is now masquerading himself as a <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Satī’</span>. I am going there to see personally that he is burnt alive.” Having said so the minister reached the funeral ground accompanied by several men by piling up one hundred maunds of wood he got a pyre prepared. The pious lady seated herself on the pyre with the dead body of her husband in her lap. The pyre was set on fire on all sides. At that moment a violent storm set in. On account of the storm the minister, the men accompanying him and all the city folk fled away from there. The storm was followed by torrential rains. It rained so heavily that the burning flames of the pyre were extinguished. Then the mimic came down the pyre descending on that side which had not yet caught fire and then once again he set fire to the pyre on all sides. Then he made his way to home. The fire burnt up the dead body. The next day when the king and the minister went up to visit the place they found there nothing but the ashes and the remains of the dead body.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Only a few days after he came to the royal palace undisguised and said—“O king, how did you find the mimicry of <span class="char-style-override-6">Satī</span>. The king said—“All right.” Then the king enquired how he could afford to remain alive. He replied—O king, I take precaution that my mimicry is not ridiculed so God protects me from harm. I have been in the heaven where I met with your father and grandfather. Their beards, moustaches and nails had grown large. I asked them whether they were all well and wanted to know from them if they were facing any trouble there. I enquired if they had any message to be conveyed to the king. Their reply was that they were all well there but they were troubled on account of the absence of a barber and wished that a barber should be sent to them. Hearing this the king said to the same barber—“You go there and serve them.” The minister said to the barber—“Just as this man went to the celestial abode in the same manner you must leave for the celestial abode tomorrow.” Then the barber said to the mimic aside “Why do you intend to get me killed?” The mimic replied—“It was you who wished undesirable things for me and asked me to present the mimicry of a <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Satī’</span> with a view to put an end to my life. That is why I am sending you forthwith, whosoever tries to harm others, invites harm to himself.” The barber said—“I take refuge in you save me from this catastrophe.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the mimic came to the King’s court faithfully narrated the whole story, from beginning to end, to the minister in the presence of the king and said—“I do not allow my mimicry to become a subject of ridicule. That is why God protects me in every possible way. When after setting fire to the pyre you came back for fear of storm and rain; torrential rains set in which extinguished the fire and I was saved. Nobody returns after entering the celestial abode, it was by the divine grace that I was saved. This poor barber should be spared.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At this the king said to him—“I am well  pleased with your mimicry. Whatever was destined has taken place. You should not grieve for it” saying so the king gladly offered thousands of rupees to the mimic. Having received the money he left for his home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Firstly this story teaches us the moral that whatever be our stage in life and whatever be our status in society we must not put our mimicry (part) to ridicule. He who plays his part well is protected by God in every possible way just as He offered protection to the mimic. Secondly we draw the lesson that we should never think ill of others for we may be backfired in the same way as the barber. (it is to be concluded).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus through the above exposition that high souled men act as in a drama for the welfare of the common people. They shape their conduct exactly in the same way as it ought to be for a man of particular caste and stage in life in which people consider him to be stationed. They reveal their true aspect to none else than the intimate ones. But those who claim themselves to be scholars, great souls, <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogīs</span>, great men or competent persons, are not so. In fact they are arrogant and hypocrites who hanker after honour, fame, prestige and their own service. Those who are really great do not, either for the sake of gold and women or for the sake of enhancing their honour, praise and prestige, cause others to have reverence for them for they have no self interest at all with both things done and things not done. They are completely rid of selfish motives. The Lord tells us in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> III. 18)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In this world the greatsouled has no use whatsoever for things done or for things not done nor has he selfish dependence of any kind on any creature.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">So for the sake of God-realization men should try to rid themselves of egotism and sense of myness either through the practice of the Yoga of knowledge or the Yoga of devotion.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">Devoted to the Welfare of All Beings</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are many paths of God-realization. The devotion to the welfare of all beings is imperative whichever path one resorts to. God abides in each and every being so to render service to any being and to afford him happiness, is verily an excellent service to God. Whatever thing a being needs at any place, God seeks his worship through that very thing. In that worship if there is no other motive than love of God—through that very selfless service one can attain God easily. Tulasīdāsajī has aptly said—</p>
<p class="Shlok"><span>परहित बस जिनके</span> <span>मन माहीं।</span></p>
<p class="Shlok">तिन कहुँ जग दुर्लभ कछु नाहीं॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Nothing in this world remains unattainable by those who have others’ welfare at heart.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has been said in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Skanda Purāṇa</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">परोपकरणं येषां जागर्ति हृदये सताम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नश्यन्ति विपदस्तेषां सम्पद: स्यु: पदे पदे॥</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Kāsī</span> 6.4-5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“All the adversities of those noble persons fritter away who nurse benevolence at heart. Such purity as is attained through performing benevolent acts, can neither be attained through ablutions in the holy places nor through bestowing profuse charities nor even through austere austerities.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Far less to speak of anything else, one can attain even God through performing benevolent acts in a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="Shlok">लभन्ते ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृषय: क्षीणकल्मषा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">छिन्नद्वैधा यतात्मान: सर्वभूतहिते रता:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The seers whose sins have been wiped out, whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, whose disciplined mind is firmly established in God and who are devoted to the welfare of all beings, attain <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> who is all Peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> This upholds the truth that the <span class="char-style-override-6">¤Rṣis</span> of stainless mind and endowed with the characteristics stated above, attained <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> who is all peace, by keeping themselves devoted to the welfare of all beings. So it is imperative on the part of man to render selfless service to grief-stricken orphaned and pitiable men that is one should dedicate oneself to the task of removing the grief of and rendering service to those who are grief-stricken and suffering from want, with one’s body mind and money. Blessed are the magnanimous persons who have dedicated their lives and their all to the service of the poor and the grief-stricken, the orphaned and the diseased. There is a beautiful story bearing on the subject.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was an exalted <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> who was endowed with dispassion and knowledge. He was possessed of all the marks described in the verse of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> quoted above. The greatest of the kings and emperors and the humblest poor people visited him. On the basis of this very verse he sermonized the people who came to him. He would emphasize the fact that God can be realized through disinterestedly affording comforts to the grief-stricken and afflicted people.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day it so happened that the ruler of that city paid a visit to that <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>. Bowing at the feet of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> the king asked—“Can God be realized even in such an age as this one? And if He can be realized what would be the easiest method for God-realization. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> replied—“God abides in all beings so God can be realized through enthusiastically rendering service in a selfless spirit to all beings. And beatitude can be attained speedily if from among them service is rendered to those who are grief-stricken, orphaned and pitiable. After listening to these exhortations the king returned to his place and from that day started rendering service to all creatures especially those who were grief-stricken and pitiable.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the expiry of a year the king one day approached the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> and submitted that though he had been following his advice for a year, he could not attain God yet. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“O king, have patience and keep yourself actively engaged in serving others in a selfless spirit particularly the grief-stricken people. Through regular practice your inner senses shall stand purified and God-realization will be attained. Hearing this the king returned home and started serving the grief-stricken more devotedly than ever before.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Practising thus another year passed but God was not realised. Then the king again approached the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> and asked him thus—Sire, as directed by you the observance of rendering service is still going on. As advised by you I have dedicated myself to serving others with my body, mind and money. A major part of the royal treasure has already been spent on acts of benevolence and yet no sign of God-realization is visible to me. At this the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā </span>said—Have firm faith, do not have the least doubt in your mind. God-realization is inevitable. You are certainly rendering service to the destitute and the grief-stricken people in a proper way and with a sincere motive but you have neither been able to render such service as ought to be done nor have you been able to serve such grief-stricken orphaned and sick people who are deserving. But you are sure to attain that standard one day or the other through continued practice performed with supreme zeal and reverence. Therefore apply with full dedication your subdued mind, intellect and senses to the task of serving the grief-stricken people in a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Listening to the nectarine words of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> the king was much pleased and having returned home and as advised by the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> began to serve again with a great zeal especially the destitute, the grief-stricken, the poor and the orphaned.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same city there lived a grief-stricken and helpless widow who supported herself and her only quite young child of five years by selling in the city the faggot band she brought from the forest. Whatever she earned was hardly enough to make their both ends meet and so she could not save even a single pice. One day when she was going to the forest with her child she noticed on the way a rich man’s son playing with top, the merry go round and other toys and urged his mother to get them for him. On hearing the child’s demand the mother said—My child, I am poor and have no money. Whatever I get by selling faggot is hardly enough to support us. How can I buy toys for you?” The innocent boy was unable to apprehend the terms ‘rich’ and ‘poor’. He simply insisted on getting the toys. He started crying and laid himself down. Any how the mother picked him up in her arms and brought him home. She tried her best to persuade him but he did not yield. That was why she could not go to the forest that day to fetch faggots and consequently both had to go without food for the whole day. The child did not give up his insistence and remained sobbing and being distressed by the child’s agony the mother kept on shedding tears. Really she did not have any money to fulfil her child’s insistent demand. It was midnight and silence prevailed everywhere. Every one was sleeping. In a corner of the hut the mother and her child were all in tears. Loud was the pitch of the child’s cries and the palace was not far away from there. The cries reached the ears of the king who lay asleep in his palace. The king startled to hear the piteous cry, got up and began to look round. The king called for the chief guard and said—“Well, some grief-stricken pitiable person is heard crying. Hurry up to that person console the person and bring the person to me.” The chief guard at once approached her and asked her to accompany him for the king had sent for her. Sighting the chief guard, the helpless woman who sold faggot began to tremble with fear and said—“Sir, this child is quite young and so he is weeping. Let this offence be condoned.” The chief guard consoled her saying that she need not fear rather she should accompany him for the king had called her out of pity. But the helpless woman was not free of fear. She thought that the king’s sleep must have been disturbed on account of her child’s weeping and so he would punish her but since the king had called for her and there was no way out she must go and she made her way to the king. She did stop weeping after hearing the words of the chief guard but she continued trembling and her sobbing child followed her.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Both reached the palace escorted by the chief guard. Seeing that pitiable sight the king consoling the mortified woman advised her not to be afraid. He told her that he wanted to know why the child was weeping. She said—“Your Majesty, I bring faggots from the forest and sell them and thus support myself and this child. Today when I was going to bring wood from the forest he became perverse to see a rich man’s child playing with top, merry-go round and other toys and obstinately insisted on my bringing for him toys of the same type. That is why I could not go to bring wood today and so he is all the more irritated on account of hunger. Though it is already mid night he goes on weeping all the time. I tried my best to pacify him but he is quite a child devoid of sensibility, so nothing can be done in the matter.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king sent for vegetables, <span class="char-style-override-6">Purīs</span> and sweets from inside the palace and offering them to her promised to send for the toys soon. The widowed mother tried repeatedly to feed the child but the obstinate child would not eat anything for his demand was not fulfilled. How could the mother partake without feeding her son? Then the king said to the chief guard—“Go to the market at once and manage to get a basketful of toys demanded by the boy from wherever they are available. The dutiful chief guard went atonce to the house of the shopkeeper who sold toys, woke him up and asked him to open the shop without delay and supply him a basketful of toys. The order of the king was obeyed and instantly a basketful of toys were supplied. The chief guard paid the reasonable price and bringing the basket placed it before the king. The king handed over all the toys to the boy. Taking as many of them as he could hold in his hands, the boy began to smile and dance. Seeing the boy happy the mother’s joy also knew no bounds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thereafter the king satiated both of them by providing them enough of food and handed over the remaining victuals and toys to the child’s mother. Both the mother and the son returned to their hut all agog, With the king’s permission the chief guard also returned to his place. It was at that moment that the king had the vision of God who is the embodiment of knowledge and Bliss and boundless was the rapture and tranquillity that he felt at the moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When it was morning the king approached the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> and making obeisance to him related the happenings from the beginning to the end. Then the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā </span>said—“O king, you have served a number of persons and spent a lot of money on act of benevolence but the service you have been able to render this day was never rendered by you before. Hearing the words of <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span> the king was extremely pleased and returned home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While the king was narrating his own story an extremely poor village hawker who had come from a distance of four miles from the city, was also seated there in the presence of <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span>. He listened to the incident with great interest and said to <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span>—“Can a poor man like me too be able to attain God?  “Why not? For God there is no distinction between the rich and  the poor. What counts with Him is one’s sentiment. Once there was a keen competition between king Chole and a poor Brahmin named Viṣṇudāsa as to who would have the vision of God first on the score of his devotion and poor Viṣṇudāsa finally came out victorious and it was the poor <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> who was blessed with the vision of God first, ‘said the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this the hawker requested the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> to tell him at length who the king Chole was, who was the poor Viṣṇudāsa, how they entered into competition and how it was that the Lord granted the poor <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> His vision prior to the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—Long before there was a great emperor named Chole in Kāṁcīpurī. All the states subjugated by him were also known by the same name when king Chole ruled over the earth there none was pauper, grief-stricken, sick person and none indulged in sinful acts. He had performed countless <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛas</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once upon a time king Chole visited a pilgrimage centre called ‘Anantashayana’ where the universal lord śrī Viṣṇu lies reclining on bed constituted of the serpent king  diśeṣa. There he offered in the prescribed manner the adoration to the divine idol of śrī Viṣṇu. He worshipped the Lord with flowers of gold, gems and pearls and lay prostrate before the idol in salutation. Immediately after Viṣṇudāsa a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> by caste and resident of Kāṁcī Nagarī with basil leaves and water in his hand came there to worship the Lord. That Brahmin sage while reciting <span class="char-style-override-6">Viṣṇusµukta</span> bathed the supreme Lord and adored Him sacramentally with the crowns of basil and basil leaves. The basil leaves covered the offerings of gems made by the king earlier. Seeing this the king flew into rage and said—“O Viṣṇudāsa, I had worshipped the Lord with gold and gems and it really looked very graceful. But you covered them all by offering basil leaves all over. Why did you do so? “You appear to be very foolish. Little do you know the devotion of Lord Viṣṇu. That is why you are trying to cover the exquisite decorative offerings with leaves. I am greatly astonished at such a behaviour of yours.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viṣṇudāsa—O king, little do you know about Lord’s devotion. You are simply proud of your emperorship. Tell me how often uptil now you have observed fasts prescribed for the devotees of Lord Viṣṇu.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king exclaimed—O Brāhmaṇa, if being proud of your devotion for Lord Viṣṇu, you are talking that way, tell me how intense your devotion for Lord Viṣṇu is. You are poor and a pauper. I am sure you have neither performed <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> and gave charities etc., for the sake of Lord Viṣṇu nor ever raised a temple anywhere before. How do you feel proud under such circumstances. Well let all the esteemed <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇas</span> who are present here listen to my bet with open ears. We shall see which of us is blessed with the vision of Lord Viṣṇu first, this will help everyone know which of us has greater devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having said so king Chole went to his royal palace. Making the great seer Mudgal his chief priest he started the sacraments of the Viṣṇu <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> which was attended by a group of <span class="char-style-override-6">¤Rṣis</span>. A lot of corn was used up and charities were bestowed on the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇas</span> with a free hand.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the other hand Viṣṇudāsa preferred to stay in the Lord’s temple and observed continuous fast abiding by the code of conduct prescribed in the śāstras for the gratification of Lord Viṣṇu. Observing fasts as usual in the months of <span class="char-style-override-6">Māgha </span>and <span class="char-style-override-6">Kārtika,</span> taking due care of the garden of basil shrubs, observing fast on the eleventh day of each fortnight (according to the Hindu calendar) and the <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa</span> of the devine formula namely.<span class="char-style-override-9">‘ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय’</span> containing twelve letters and the worship of śrī Viṣṇu with sixteen articles commonly used in worship along with ceremonious rejoicings of dance and song—this was his routine. These were the observances which he followed every day without exception. He reflected on śrī Viṣṇu even while walking, eating and sleeping. He was equalminded and he looked upon Lord Viṣṇu present in very being. He performed ceremonial closing of the fast and observed the special rituals regularly meant to be held in the months of <span class="char-style-override-6">Māgha</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Kārtika</span> with a view to gratify Lord Viṣṇu.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, both—king Chole and Viṣṇudāsa started adoring Lord Viṣṇu in a competitive spirit both stuck fast to their observances and the senses and the actions of both of them were dedicated to God alone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day it so happened that the food cooked by Viṣṇudāsa after the performance of daily ritual was stolen by someone. Nobody espied the man who stole it. Though his food was stolen, Viṣṇudāsa did not cook food again for by doing so he would not have got time to offer his evening prayers and there was the fear of a lapse in his daily rituals The next day when after cooking food at the usual hours, he went to make offerings of it to Lord Viṣṇu someone came up and took away the whole of the cooked food. Thus for seven consecutive days someone would come and deprive him of his victuals. Viṣṇudāsa was greatly astonished at the incident. He began to reflect thus— who could it be who stole away his cooked food? I have resolved to live as a monk in this area and as such I cannot give up this place. If I engage myself in cooking again there will be lapse on  my part in the worship. I do not eat till I do not make an offering of all the dishes to śrī Viṣṇu. If I go without food how shall I be able to keep myself alive till the end of this religious observance. So I should protect the cooked food well today.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reflecting thus, Viṣṇudāsa having cooked the food stood somewhere nearby unnoticed by others. Meanwhile there came into his sight a pariah who was ready to take away his food. The whole of his body was emaciated with hunger, helplessness was visible at his face and nothing except bones and skin was to be found all over his body. Seeing him the heart of Viṣṇudāsa, the gentle <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa,</span> was filled with compassion. He said to him—“Stop, stop my brother. Why do you take after all this unseasoned  plain food? At least take this purified butter. Seeing the great <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> approaching him with these words the pariah hurriedly ran away from there and fainting with fright fell down there. Viṣṇudāsa atonce approached him and out of compassion began to fan him with the help of his clothing. After that when he got up he beheld to his astonishment that he was not a pariah but was the very embodiment of the supreme deity vested with the conch, the discus and the mace. He had yellow robe round his waist. He was four-armed, on his bosom there was the mark of <span class="char-style-override-6">śrīvatsa</span> and the head gracefully decorated with diadem. His body was handsomely dark complexioned and His bosom looked exquisitely beautiful on account of the gleaming gem called <span class="char-style-override-6">Kaustubha</span> worn on the bosom. He was so invested with <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> propensities such as horripilation and shedding tears at the sight of his own Lord standing before him manifestedly that he forgot to sing hymns and to make salutations to Him. At that time arrived there gods like Indra etc., and the ¤<span class="char-style-override-6">Rṣis</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Maharṣis</span> also arrived there, Lord Viṣṇu clasped Viṣṇudāsa to his bosom and blessing him with form like that of Himself He left for Vaikuṇ¢ha  abode. <br/>Then initiated in <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> king Chole sighted Viṣṇudāsa seated in an aerial vehicle proceeding towards the abode of Lord Viṣṇu. The king immediately calling His preceptor sage Mudgal told him that the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> in competition with whom I had performed <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span>, charity and other rituals is going to Vaikuṇ¢ha abode even before me assuming the form of Lord Viṣṇu. I being perfectly initiated in this <span class="char-style-override-6">VaiṣṇavaYajÛa</span> performed sacrifice and fulfilled the wishes of <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇas </span>through charity but till now Lord Viṣṇu did not become propitious to me and this <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> has been blessed with Divine vision through his devotion alone. Therefore it seems that God does not get pleased through charity and <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛas</span>. Devotion alone is the principal means to Divine Vision.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having been initiated in the performance of <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛas</span> since his childhood, King chole would keep himself engaged in the same task that is why he had no issue. So he coronated his own nephew to the throne. Then he went to the shed where <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛas</span> were performed and standing near the sacrificial altar and addressing śrī Viṣṇu he loudly spoke the undernoted words three times—O Lord Viṣṇu offer me your unswerving devotion through mind, tongue and body.” Saying so he hurled himself into the fire. As soon as the king jumped into the fire. Lord śrī Viṣṇu appeared and embracing him seated him in a chariot. Then investing him His own form the great God left with him and other gods for His celestial abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On hearing the incident the heart of the hawker was filled with great delight and he was encouraged to ask the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> how a pauper like him could attain God speedily. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—knowing living being as pervaded by God, you ought to serve them through your actions according to Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa’s injunctions in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत: प्रवृत्तिर्भूतानां येन सर्वमिदं ततम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok"><span>स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानव:॥</span> </p>
<p class="TXT-Right"><span class="char-style-override-10">(18.46)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Man attains the highest perfection (the supreme God) through his own natural duties; from whom the tide of creation has streamed forth and by whom all the universe is pervaded.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having been exhorted by <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span> the hawker returned to his village and began to perform practice according to his direction. He earned two rupees per day by working as a vendor. With one and a half rupees he supported himself and his family and spent the rest in the service of the grieving orphans, helpless distressed and hungry people. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When three years passed thus rendering service to others but no sign of God-realization was visible, he approached the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā </span>once again and said—<span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī,</span> I earn two rupees each day I spent one and a half rupee in supporting myself and spent eight annas in the service of the grief-stricken people. But no preliminary sign of God-realization is visible in me. Kindly tell me now what I should do to attain God-realization at the earliest. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā </span>said—Whatever you do is all right. You should go on rendering with greater zeal, cheerfulness and faith, service especially to the poor, the destitute, the grief-stricken and the sick regarding them as the very image of God. Saying ‘very well’ the hawker, returned home and again engaged himself in serving the grief-stricken people with greater zeal as per directions of <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same city there lived a wood seller under a thatched roof tied up with his own hands. He supported himself with difficulty by selling dry wood brought from the forest. One day it so happened that as he could not gather wood at the edge he went deep into the forest as such he returned home late. When he came back with the wood it was noon. On account of extreme heat of the summer he got soaked in perspiration. He was yet at a distance of one mile from the city when he began to feel nausea and he fainted and fell down. The bundle of wood fell off his head on one side and he became senseless.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Meanwhile that pedlar started towards the city with his saleable articles arranged in a shallow dish. On the way when he saw the wood cutter lying senseless his heart melted with pity. The pedlar had boiled gram and sufficient water with him. At once he sprinkled a little water on his face, dropped a little water into his mouth and began to fan him with the skirt of clothing. This helped him regain senses a little and he opened his eyes. When he came round and sat up he helped him on to shady place, offered him sufficient quantity of boiled grams to eat realizing his utter poverty, grief and hunger and made him drink water. He was very much sated and he related his own sad tale from beginning to the end. Out of his gratification for the pedlar he began to sing his praise. At this the pedlar said—“O dear, only God is worthy of praise what I did was prompted by God. I am simply an instrument. If you pray at all you ought to pray to God. Tell me if I can be of any more service to you. I am at your service. The wood cutter said—“Now I have regained strength. I am not the least unwell now. Help me lift this bundle on to my head so that I may proceed towards the city.” The pedlar helped him lift his bundle on to his head and wood cutter made his way towards the city.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then as soon as the pedlar with the shallow broad plate and the water container was about to start towards the city God manifested Himself. At the vision of the manifest divinity he began to feel horripilation over his body and he started shedding tears. At that moment his rapture and composure were beyond all measure. Then the Lord said to him—“I am satisfied with the services you have rendered to the poor and the grief-stricken people. Now ask for any boon. The pedlar said—“You have gratified me by granting me your vision. There is nothing beyond that to be asked for.” When the Lord insisted again and again he said—Let me always have singular and unadulterated love of you.” At this the Lord said—“Be it so” and then He disappeared.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The pedlar lost in the rapturous love came to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> and falling prostrate at his revered feet told him from beginning to the end what had happened. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“The service you rendered to the utterly poor grief-stricken helpless wood-cutter by making him eat gram and drink water was indeed excellent. This service of yours was apparently far better than any other done before. The pedlar felt joy all over to hear the words of <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span> and after making salutations to him returned home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">From this story we should draw the lesson that if there is some delay in God-realization even while we are engaged in rendering service to the grief-stricken and helpless creatures, we should not lose patience rather knowing everyone pervaded by God should remain actively engaged in serving others with great reverence, faith, humility and love in a disinterested spirit. Service rendered with love and reverence regarding everyone as the image of God and performed disinterestedly, becomes a spiritual practice of high order. So while resorting to this practice such propensities should be gradually developed. How much better it is if both the sentiments—God abiding in all being and disinterestedness are preserved but if even one of them remains alive it can be helpful in God-realization. So regarding every being as pervaded by the Supreme and Absolute Brahma, we should actively engage enthusiastically ourselves in rendering service and benevolence to all.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">The Effect of King Cakraveṇa’s Dispassionateness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I have not come across the story of king Cakraveṇa in any book but it has come down to us as folk lore. I do not know for certain whether this legend is factual or fictitious. Whatever be its source we must derive lesson from it. The story runs as under—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once there was a king named Cakraveṇa. He was endowed with virtues and good conduct, piety, truthfulness, self-reliance, nature to hard work, selflessness, dispassionateness, knowledge, devotion, sublimity and was a God-realized high soul and practising austerities. Considering the money of the state as profane he did not utilize it himself or for his wife. Whatever tax was realized from the public was totally spent for the welfare of the common people. He managed the affairs of the state disinterestedly and unegoistically and devoted himself to it heart and soul. He had great hold on the public. As in the kingship of Rāma, none was unhappy in his kingdom. All the people were happy in every respect.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For his subsistence he depended on his own farming. Instead of bulls the queen herself would drag the plough whereas the king would sow the seeds. They used to farm sugarcane, cotton, grain, fruit and vegetables. They would support themselves with the corn produced by them in their fields. They would wear clothes woven by themselves from the cotton produced in their fields, would eat jaggery from the sugar-cane and fed themselves with the grams, fruit and vegetables produced in their fields. His wife had no ornaments for he refrained from using the public money for getting ornaments and with the produce in the field he could hardly manage to feed and clothe themselves in a simple way. Besides farming he certainly did find time to devote to state affairs. His life was like that of a farmer leading a simple and pious life. Except for the six hours of sleep he spent all his time only in the adoration of God, doing good to others, managing state affairs and agriculture. He had love, compassion and impartiality for all the beings alike. Knowing all beings as God he served everyone with disinterestedness and love, he performed all the work related to his own self with his own hands and would not let servants or state employees do it. Getting rid of the feelings of ego and attachment, he performed every duty with zeal and patience.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day a very large fair was held in the country where king Cakraveṇa had his residence. People from different states gathered in the fair in very large number. People usually came to have a glimpse of the king and the queen but the crowd of visitors was a bit larger on account of the fair being held. Those who visited the king were mainly males whereas those who visited the queen were mostly females. One day a number of ladies belonging to the affluent business class families adorned with jewelleries and silken clothes and surrounded with a number of maid servants approached the queen to have her vision. Those ladies said—“O queen, even our working class women do not like to wear such clothes as you are wearing. Just look, how fashionable clothes and ornaments our maids are wearing. You must put on clothes and ornaments better than ours. Just as these maid servants are ours so are we the maid servants of our queen. Your husband is a great emperor, if you give him a little hint he will provide you with clothes and ornaments better than ours. You are certainly our mistress and we are much shocked to see you in such garments. We want to see you wearing such garments as are appropriate for the empress of an emperor. Having spoken these words and leaving their impression on her they went away. The queen was greatly affected by what they had said. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When the emperor came at night the queen related to him all that had happened and when the day dawned she humbly related to the king what the affluent ladies of the business class families had said and urged him to send for costly garments and precious ornaments for her. The king replied—“How can I get them for you? Far less to speak of using public money (for my sake) I refrain from touching it with my hands for it pollutes the intellect.” The queen too was a pious lady of a high order but the ladies adorned with clothes and jewellery had a far-reaching effect on her so the queen said—I am not concerned with all that. You are the emperor and I am your chief queen. You will have to do me the favour of providing valuable garments and ornaments befitting a chief queen.” Being inspired by the love of his wife the king began to reflect thus—In spite of the queen’s repeated insistence I cannot, at any cost, use the public money for personal end. But I am an emperor and I can, of course, levy tax on the wicked, tyrant and powerful, monarchs.” After making such deliberation the king summoned the minister in charge of external affairs and those states which were under his subjugation and said—you go to Rāvaṇa, the demon king, and tell him that you have come on behalf of king Cakraveṇa and  he sent you to receive one and a quarter maund of gold from him as tax.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As ordered by the emperor the minister, accompanied by some men and seated in a chariot reached the sea shore and then crossing the sea in a ship reached the other shore and entered into Laṅkā and presenting himself in the court delivered the message of the emperor with great politeness and courtesy. On hearing the message Rāvaṇa laughed and spoke to the courtiers thus—Just see, the world is not yet devoid of such foolish kings as hope to realize tax from a great and autonomous emperor as I who collects tax from all—the ¤<span class="char-style-override-6">Rṣis,</span> the gods and demons and others. He wanted to make the messenger of king Cakraveṇa a captive but at the request of the courtiers he let him go. Then the messenger left the court of Rāvaṇa and came to the sea shore.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Afterwards when Rāvaṇa went to Mandodarī in the palace, he laughed and jested saying—there is some king named Cakraveṇa in India. Today one of his messengers came to my court and asked me to give him one and a quarter maund of gold as tax. I could not help my laughter at this. Look, such foolish men are still alive in this world as expect to exact tax from me who levies tax on everyone. I wanted to make his messenger captive but being urged by the courtiers I let him go. Expressing her grief over the incident Mandodarī said—“O master, you have done something most undesirable. I know Cakraveṇa is a pious and truthful king. His discus is ever in motion. He who defies his orders, is subjected to harm. You must have sought reconciliation before sending the messenger away. Try to know his whereabouts and seek reconcilement with him even now, otherwise we may have to undergo unimaginable harm. Rāvaṇa said—“How cowardly you are. You are afraid of even ordinary human kings. I care not a fig for it.” She said—I shall show you the influence of king Cakraveṇa, only tomorrow morning.” When it was morning Mandodarī went with the king on the roof where she everyday fed the pigeons with corn. Many pigeons would come there to peck at the grains. While offering grains to the pigeons Mandodarī said to the pigeons—take heed. In the name of king Rāvaṇa I forbid you to peck at the grains.” But they went on pecking. Then the queen said to the king—“Look, all of them continued pecking at the grains even before you and even after being forbidden in your name.” Rāvaṇa said—“Nonsense, these birds are but too ignorant.” Mandodarī said—“Now look at the influence of king Cakraveṇa and then she addressed the birds thus—Take heed, I ask you in the holy name of Cakraveṇa not to peck at the grains. Hearing this the birds simultaneously stopped pecking at the grains. One of those pigeons was deaf. He was unable to hear anything at all. As soon as he picked up the grain into its beak the neck of the pigeon was severed and fell on the ground. The queen said to Rāvaṇa—Look, being forbidden in the holy name of Cakraveṇa all stopped pecking at the grains. Only a deaf pigeon picked up a grain consequently it was beheaded by the discus of king Cakraveṇa. Then the queen said to the birds—“I withdraw the  prohibition imposed in the holy name of Cakraveṇa now start pecking.” At once the birds started pecking at the grains. The queen further said—In the name of king who is standing before you I ask you not to peck at the grains! But none paid heed to it in spite of the fact that the king was standing in person before them and they went on pecking at the grains. At this Mandodarī said to Rāvaṇa—“Well, you do not hold any influence at all on these birds but think of the influence king Cakraveṇa wields. In spite of his absence what influence does he wield.” Rāvaṇa said—It seems you have your own maneuvering behind it for such things are beyond the understanding of those poor birds.” Saying this and making evasive reply Rāvaṇa went away to his court.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thither, the minister of king Cakraveṇa prepared a replica of Laṅkā with the help of a thick compound made by mixing collyrium-like black mud at the sea shore and with water and levelling the ground at the sea shore. By dropping the loose mud a little he gave shape to the rampart, the towers and gates etc. Towers were formed on all sides on the parapet and inside the fortification wall were displayed the capital of Laṅkā and the important buildings of the city in diminutive form. After the careful formation of these things once again he went to the court of Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa was astonished to see him and said to him—“Well, why have you come over here again?” He replied—“I want to show you a wonderful feat. Please be good enough to accompany me to the sea shore.” Rāvaṇa was filled with curiosity to have a look at the wonderful feat. Accompanied by some of his courtiers he arrived at the sea shore, where the minister had set up an artificial Laṅkā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He asked Rāvaṇa—“Well, is it exactly the imitation of your Laṅkā? Rāvaṇa looked at his artistic work and said—“All right, but was it alone for this purpose that you brought me here? ‘No’, no, said the minister. ‘I am going to show you a marvellous feat through this replica of Laṅkā. Don’t you clearly see the parapet, the gate, the turrets and the towers  on the eastern side of Laṅkā, “I see them,” replied Rāvaṇa. The minister said—“Now I am going to raze in the holy name of king Cakraveṇa, the towers built on the eastern gate of Laṅkā. Now watch the towers on the eastern gate of your Laṅkā falling simultaneously. Saying this the minister solemnly recalling the name of king Cakraveṇa, let the towers raised on the eastern gate of the Laṅkā of his own creation fall.<br/>Simultaneously with their fall, were seen falling the towers of the real Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa was wonder-stricken to see this. Then the messenger said—“Now I am going to raze all the four towers on all sides on the gate of the eastern parapet of my Laṅkā and you will notice the towers of your own Laṅkā being razed to the ground simultaneously. Saying  this he pulled down the towers on the gate of the eastern parapet of the earthen Laṅkā, after recalling the holy name of Cakraveṇa and with them smashed into pieces the towers raised on the eastern gate of the real Laṅkā. Rāvaṇa was dismayed to see this and he was reminded of the words of Mandodarī.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the minister of king Cakraveṇa said—“O king, even if you refuse to offer one and a quarter maund of gold as ‘tax’, king Cakraveṇa willn’t be obliged to enter into battle with you. The discus of his influence keeps on revolving all the time. I alone am capable enough of destroying your Laṅkā. I am going to destroy your Laṅkā out of existence just now with a single blow of my hand. You may defend it if you can. If you want to save Laṅkā please give a maund and a quarter of gold as tax for there is no way out except this. Rāvaṇa thought—In my very presence the towers and all the four turrets on the eastern gate which were made of metals and were strong enough have fallen down. If he wields such powers, it is but a child’s play to destroy the whole of Laṅkā. Thinking so he consented to offer a maund and a quarter of gold as tax and said to the minister—come along. I will give you a maund and a quarter of gold. Then he sent him off with the desired quantity of gold.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The minister returned to the king with the gold. Approaching the king and the queen he put the gold before them and said—As desired by you I have obtained from Rāvaṇa a maund and a quarter of gold as tax. When the king wanted to know how he could manage to get the gold he narrated to him the whole story from beginning to the end. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The queen was too amazed to learn about the incident and she was much impressed with it. She asked the king how it had happened. The king said—“Through self-reliance and industry we carry on farming and thereby support ourselves and spend a life of self-denial disowning the sense of doership and disinterestedly spend the public money for the common good and do not even touch the public money. It is certainly the outcome of all this.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing these words the queen changed her mind. The queen said—My lord, I won’t put on valuable garments and jewellery. I shall lead as usual the same austere life. I shall not bring about any change at all. Through the evil association of the affluent ladies of the business class people my mind had deviated from the path of self-denial, dispassion and righteousness but now I am shorn off the influence of that evil association. I beseech your forgiveness for the undesirable insistence made on you, kindly excuse my fault and send back the gold.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king granted her prayer and said to the minister—“By the grace of God she is shorn off the evil influence of bad association. Now take back the gold to the place from where you  brought it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the orders of the king the minister without any delay again approached Rāvaṇa, the king of Laṅkā in his court and spoke thus—“King Cakraveṇa has sent back gold of yours. By the grace of God the desire for wearing valuable garments and ornaments that arose in the heart of his wife, has since now subsided he now no more stands in need of this gold.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing this Rāvaṇa was all the more impressed with the self-denial of Cakraveṇa. Keeping back the gold he bade farewell to the minister with inordinate regards. After returning from there he narrated to the king and the queen in detail how he returned the gold. On hearing from the minister the king and the queen were extremely happy. King Cakraveṇa had his influence on all—the <span class="char-style-override-6">Yakṣas,</span> the demons, gods, men, <span class="char-style-override-6">¤Rṣis,</span> sages, animals and birds alike. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this story we should derive the lesson that every man and woman should try to earn his or her livelihood in an unmotived way according to one’s status in society and stage in life, and through just and honest means. It is undesirable on one’s part even to support oneself by depending on others. Even if we are able to avail ourselves the opportunity of eating dry fruit and sweets by spending the money obtained through dishonest, deceitful and unscrupulous means they prove themselves venomous to us. But if we are able to get only a handful of grams to eat purchased with the money earned through just and pious means, it is nectarine to us. Except in the case of sickness and emergency we should accustom ourselves to do all our personal work as far as possible with our own hands in spite of the fact that servants, attendants, wife, sons, pupils and others are available for the job so that dependence on others could be avoided. It is rather shameful to depend on others for subsistence for such men who seek beatitude.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Moreover, knowing time as invaluable we should not waste even a moment. Remembering God at all times we should engage ourselves in doing good to others and in performing duties for our upkeep. Except for six hours of sleep we should not waste even a moment nor should we misuse it. Human life is very invaluable so no moment of it should be allowed to pass unutilized. We should keep on doing that very work which our intellect supposed to be the best.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">Keeping in view the fact that bad association even though for a short while proves harmful to us, we should not have association even for a moment even unknowingly with the atheist, the vile, the neglectful, those seeking sexual enjoyments, the sinful, the worthless, the indolent, the parasites, those fond of wearing precious garments and ornaments, those fond of sports and feats and addicted to intoxicants and those indulging in evil pastimes etc, be they male or female and ridding ourselves from neglectfulness, indolence, sleep, fear, excitement, attachment, malice and indulgence in evil propensities etc., we should spend ourlife time only in the remembrance, and meditation, self-study and association with the good and dispassion, self-denial, self-control and disinterestedness and knowing all the created beings as the image of God and getting rid of attachment and egotism we should render service to one and all with mind and body and should cherish causeless compassion and love equally for all.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Invaluable Instructions for Making Life a Success </p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> 13.8)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of this world and the next and also absence of egotism pondering again and again on the pains and evils inherent in birth, death, old age and disease.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A story is devised here to bring home to the readers the purport of the above verse—King Viṣvaksena of Avantikāpurī was extremely devout. There was abundance of wealth and grains in his kingdom. His subjects were under his control. He did not lack anything at all but he had no issue. He used to pay a visit to a great soul who was virtuous, had a good conduct and was endowed with dispassion and rendered him service.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day the high souled man asked—“You have been coming to me since long, what could possibly be the reason of your frequent visits.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viṣvaksena said—I don’t lack anything. There is abundance of wealth and grains in my kingdom. But the only thing I lack is a male issue. Be gracious enough to tell me the means by which I should get an excellent son.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great soul said—“You can perform the Viṣṇu <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> for the purpose. If God deems proper he will bless you with a son.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As advised by the great soul king Viṣvaksena sacrimoniously performed the Viṣṇu <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span>. His wife conceived as a result of taking the remaining part of offerings at the <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> and after ten months she gave birth to a son. This child was very lovely and was intelligent. It seemed as if he had fallen from <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga</span> during his previous birth. At his birth the king performed all the rites prescribed by the <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstras</span> such as <span class="char-style-override-6">Jātakarma</span> etc., and named him ‘Janārdana.’ When Janārdana grew up a bit, a teacher  was deputed to impart him preliminary education at home. Being sharp witted Janārdana soon acquired efficiency in the acquisition of knowledge. He became a good scholar of Sanskrit and other languages. He was full of affection for other boys. Neither he quarrelled with anyone nor called them names. He was simple and righteous by nature and was endowed with virtues, good conduct and intelligence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day when king Viṣvaksena visited the great soul he took his son also with him. The king made obeisance to the great soul. Noticing this the son also complimented in the same way.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king said—“O great soul, as a result of the religious observance suggested by you I have been blessed with this son only through your good grace. So be good enough to instruct him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great soul spoke—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of this world and the next, and also absence of egotism, pondering again and again on the pains and evils inherent in birth, death, old age and disease.” And having watched the gestures and postures of the boy he said that the boy appeared to be a man detracted from God-realization in the previous birth and so he might become in future an exalted soul endowed with dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing his words the king returned home and calling his wife, the ministers and the attendants in seclusion told them everything and instructed them that at all times the boy should be allowed to live a comfortable and luxurious life and should be provided with excellent dishes and fashionable things. He should always be kept aloof from matters relating to devotion, knowledge and renunciation. Adequate precautions should be taken lest something should be the cause of arousing the sense of devotion, discrimination and dispassion in him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Every arrangement was made in accordance with the king’s behest but Janārdana’s inner conscience was replete with hereditary traits of the previous birth and no check could be imposed on them. Besides the teachings of the great soul had left considerable impression on his mind. Janārdana did play with other boys of his age but he was neither ever enticed by games nor by luxuries and comforts. Whenever he went out on tour he was always accompanied by Vidyāsāgara, the king’s minister, who was verily briefed by the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Janārdana became eighteen years old he was married and he began to live with his wife. After sometime she conceived. When the time of delivery was at hand the lady had to undergo much pain during the day. The following night she gave birth to a son. And as it was, Janārdana was with his wife at the time and he was very much bewildered to notice the pangs at the time of delivery. Seeing the infant coming out of the womb with placenta and excreta he became much repentant and with this, inherently arose in his heart the feeling of dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When it was morning the ministers arrived. All the inmates of the royal palace also gathered. Everyone expressed concern over the pangs that Janārdana’s wife had to experience during the night. They called in the physicians for consultation. The physicians said that though in fact the child had to suffer a lot there was no cause to worry.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then Janārdana asked Vidyāsāgara—“How is it that the infant cried so much and experienced such excruciating pain?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara said—In the prenatal stage all the exits remain closed and when the infant comes out of the womb he has to undergo at a time a lot of trouble.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Why do placenta and excreta exist there?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—These remain there even while it is in the womb.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Then it must be very troublesome to remain in the womb, I suppose.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—Undoubtedly it is so. The trouble of staying in the womb is quite terrible indeed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Why after all there is so much of trouble in the womb?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—It can be ascribed to the sins of the previous births.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—What do you mean by ‘previous births’?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—The human form in which he existed prior to the present birth is known as ‘previous birth.’ In that form he had committed some sin and in consequence of it, the infant had to suffer so much.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—How do you define the term ‘sin’?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—All the activities prohibited by the <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstra</span> such as telling lies, duplicity, thieving, having sexual intercourse with others’ wives, the indulgence in eating meat and drinking wine, and torturing others etc., are called sins.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—What goes by the name <span class="char-style-override-6">‘śāstra’</span>?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—The religious books such as the Vedas, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Upaniṣads,</span> the ancient lore etc., are known as <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstra</span>. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Are these books available in our home?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—No, they are not.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Then send for them for I would like to go through them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara, the minister kept mum. He made no reply to it. Hearing these words of the minister Janārdana became rather sad. Visualizing the pains undergone in the womb and at the time of birth he began to ruminate thus, “Ah! What a pity.” His delightful and smiling face suddenly faded. The dark shadows of sorrow were clearly visible on his face. Noticing this the king asked—“O Honourable minister, why does the prince look sullen?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara said—He is a bit repentant on account of the birth of a child.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king said—“The child’s birth should certainly make him happy.” Then the king asked the prince—“Why do you look sad?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The prince said—Nothing unusual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king Viṣvaksena asked the minister to escort the prince on a pleasant outing and take him round the gardens and orchards in order he may feel pleasure. Vidyāsāgara carried out his orders. In a beautiful coach with charming horses yoked to it, the minister took the prince to the garden for an outing. As he reached the outskirts of the city he chanced to see a leper with decaying fingers and toes. The fingers of that leper had fallen off his feet, ears, nose and eyes were deformed and he was walking with faltering steps.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana asked—“What is it, revered minister?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He is a leper’, replied Vidyāsāgara.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—What has brought about such a plight? </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—It is outcome of great sins committed in the past.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Can I too be subjected to such a plight?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—For God’s sake let not such a thing happen to  a meritorious person like you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—I suppose you mean that there is a possibility.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—O prince, only such a man as is a great sinner suffers from such a disease. Nothing can be foretold about you. But this much is certain that if you have committed great sins in the past, you can also be subjected to such a plight.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Please send for such books for my reading as may contain the description of the consequences of various dire sins. I told you so on a previous occasion. Please send for them as early as possible now.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—Such books can be sent for if your father consents.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Meanwhile he came across another man whose entire body was covered with wrinkles. Hair had grown white, parts of his body were gnarled and was dim-sighted. His waist was bent dropping his burden on a stick he walked along like a hunch backed man, his hands and legs were trembling and was much troubled on account of repeated cough and cold. Seeing him the prince asked Vidyāsāgara who he was.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—“He is ninety year old man.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—“Shall I too be reduced to such a miserable state when I shall be ninety.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—“May you live long, O prince. When a man grows old everyone is invariably reduced to such a state.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It caused a grave concern in the heart of Janārdana when he came to know that he too might be reduced to that state. Thus after seeing men suffering from disease and old age the prince lost the high expectations he cherished in his heart regarding good health and good physique.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Later on while on his way back he passed by the funeral ground, He found a dead body burning there and another dead body being carried to the cremation ground by men saying, only the name Rāma is true and some men following them mourning for the dead.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The prince enquired—“What sort of place is this?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—“It is a cremation ground.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—“What is being done here?” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—“Whoever is dead is burnt here.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—What sort of procession is  coming this way? And why are the men walking with the procession weeping?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—It seems that some young person has expired and the members of his family are carrying his dead body. The persons mourning appear to be his father, brothers and the members of his family.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—What is death and what is called a dead body?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—The departure of mind, senses and life breath from the body is called death and when a body becomes lifeless it is called a dead body which is brought here by the members of the family and burnt here and then they return home.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Why then do they mourn?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—It seems all of them loved the man dearly. Now the man is departing from them forever so the members grieved by his bereavement are weeping.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Do we too shall be obliged to die?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—O prince, don’t say so. May God grant you a life of a hundred years.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—It matters little for we are destined to die one day or the other.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—O prince, all are destined to die one day or the other. Death is inevitable for all who are born.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing the words of the minister the prince became thoughtful.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After going ahead he came across a great soul who was endowed with dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The prince asked—Who is this man?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—He is a great soul who has attained liberation in his mortal frame and is endowed with dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Who is called a great soul, who is endowed with dispassion and is said to have attained salvation in his mundane existence?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—Those who have attained beatitude through the practice of remembrance and meditation. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—What does the term beatitude signify?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—The supreme peace and the rapturous state obtained through the practice of discretion, dispassion, meditation and remembrance etc., is known as beatitude and the man who has attained beatitude is called a great soul who has attained liberation even in his mundane existence. He attains eternal identification with God and never comes back to this unsubstantial world so conspicuously marked with birth and death. In fact only the birth of such a person in this world is blessed one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—Well revered minister, can I too not become such a man?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—Why not. Whoever desires from the core of his heart, can become so. But you are yet a boy and you should better enjoy the worldly enjoyments. Such things can be sought afterwards.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing these words prince Janārdana was greatly overwhelmed and the thought of attaining beatitude at the earliest began to haunt his mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—“Can a man not die during his youth? Just now you told me that the young man had expired and his dead body is being carried away in that procession.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—A man can die in his young age. Due to some dire sins of previous birth one dies in his young age.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana—“Is there any guarantee that I would not die in my young age?”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Vidyāsāgara—“There can be no such guarantee. Destiny is the main cause in one’s death.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He returned home. Finding streaks of unconcernedness grow more obvious than before on his son’s face king Viṣvaksena’s mind was filled with anxiety. Finding the condition of the prince unchanged even on the third day Viṣvaksena asked the minister—I always find the prince’s face faded. No ray of cheerfulness is visible on his face what could be the cause of such a state? Vidyāsāgara—O king, nothing can be predicted. This state of the prince has been continuing ever since he begot a child three days ago.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king said to the minister once again—“Attract him as much as you can towards the pleasantries, luxuries and worldly enjoyments. Taking his friends into confidence, take him to places where dramatic performances and sports are held and also to the places where spectacular things are displayed. Provide him delicious dishes of various kinds sweets and dry fruit. Make him see beautiful and picturesque scenes and sights. Sprinkle on his head scents and perfumed oils, attract his heart towards merry making by making arrangements for dance and concert.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The minister arranged for everything according to the behest of the king but all in vain. No worldly thing now appeared to have any charm for the prince. All worldly objects seemed to him to be transitory, yielding pain and quite sapless. Through the developing of dispassion in worldly enjoyments they now appeared to him to be repulsive. To indulge in worldly enjoyments seemed to the prince to be full of great harassment. Scent and flower, scented oils seemed to him as offensive as urine. Bed strewn with flowers, flowers and wreathes as well as sandal were as resentful to him as are wet clothes to one suffering from cough and cold. The recital of <span class="char-style-override-6">Vīṇā</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Sitāra</span> and listening to them were as jarring to his ears as a clamour, dramatic performances, sports, feats and spectacular things now seemed to him to be unwarranted. Fruit, dry fruit and sweets of the best sort now tasted to him as undesirable and tasteless as these are to a patient suffering from fever. On account of developing inordinate dispassion in body and physical enjoyments, no worldly object seemed to him to be pleasure giving. He had lost all charms in each and every object.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Noticing unusually full of anxiety and unconcernedness, the king said—I have been noticing moroseness and anxiety on your face ever since you begot a child three days ago. What is the reason of such a state of mind? Why is this moroseness and anxiety on such an occasion of delight and rejoicing?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana said—Father, whatever you have said is quite reasonable and veracious. When the child came out of the womb, I was much grieved and astonished to see it taking birth along with placenta and excreta and to hear his painful cry and I insistently asked the minister why it was so. The minister explained to me that he had to undergo the trouble in consequence of his past sins. Hearing this from him I was full of anxious thoughts that in case I shall commit sins in the form of telling lies, duplicity, thieving, violence and indulgence in eating meat and drinking wine etc. I too shall be obliged to stay in the womb and undergo the pain of being born.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">King Viṣvaksena said—“It’s all false and mere flight of fancy. There is no birth after death. Then he reprovingly asked the minister—“Well, was it you who have told him all this?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The minister trembled and said—“your majesty, it was I indeed who said this.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana began to say—“By your order the minister escorted me out of the city for a walk. It was then that I saw a leper on the way. Seeing him I became sad and on being enquired he explained to me that one suffers from such a disease on account of the past sins.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king spoke—There is nothing as sin. It is the outcome of the fancy of such foolish persons as this minister. The leper you saw was born as such and shall remain as such. He stands no match for you. You were born as you are now and shall not be subject to any change.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the king angrily told the minister—“I feel pity for your poor wits. Why did you delude my boy?” The minister said—Your majesty, I explained to him as per my knowledge of the subject. Janārdana continued—Then I met a very sorrowful old man on the way I never saw such a man before. When I tried to know from the minister about him he told me that he was an old man. When a man becomes old everyone reaches such a state.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king said—“No, it is never like that. Those who are old are ever the same and those who are young remain so.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then he angrily asked the minister—“Were you deputed to impart all these instructions?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The minister said—“On being enquired by the prince things were explained according to my humble knowledge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king said—“Fie upon such knowledge of yours. Are such things worth being told to young boys?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then Janārdana began to say—“Thereafter as we were returning after the walk, we saw a number of men burning a dead body and men surrounding the dead on all sides. Meanwhile I noticed a procession coming that way from the city. Four men were holding something up on their shoulders, some men were crying <span class="char-style-override-6">“Rāma Nāma Satya Hai”</span> (only the Divine Name is true) and some men who walked behind them were crying all the time. I was dismayed to see all this. When I enquired of the minister he told me that some young man had died. The members of his family are bringing him to the cremation ground and those crying seem to be the father, brothers and other members of the family of the deceased. They are weeping on account of his bereavement. Ever since I saw that sight I have constantly been pondering over death. I suppose I too shall meet the same fate when I am dead.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viṣvaksena said—“You shouldn’t pay any heed to what this foolish minister says. A young man can never die. Whatever he has told you is merely the outcome of his foolish wits.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the king said to his minister—“Was it proper for you to delude my son this way. You have simply deceived me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With folded hands Vidyāsāgara said—“Your majesty, on being asked I told him what I thought to be proper at that time?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana said—“On our way back when we entered the city we came across a man wearing ochre coloured clothes. On being asked the minister said that he was a great soul endowed with dispassion and having attained beatitude in his mortal frame. He has attained beatitude through remembrance, meditation, association with the great souls and study of the scripture so he enjoys the supreme peace and ecstacy all the time. He shall attain the supreme abode of the Lord and will not be reborn in this world, fraught with pain. Since then I have been musing over the question whether I would become such a man. On making querry I came to know that all these things are written in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedas,</span> the scriptures, the histories and the myths. So I asked the minister to send for those books but he replied that he could send for them only with your permission. So father, send for those books for me at an early date.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viṣvaksena said—“Dear son, those books are not worth being gone through by you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the king said to the minister—“It seems you have poisoned my son’s wits by telling him the names of these books. It is the consequence of your teachings that this tender-hearted handsome prince having developed dispassion for all worldly enjoyments in such a tender age, is lost all the time in reflecting on enlightenment and dispassion. The result of the purpose of your appointment has been reverse. You are not worth remaining in my service any longer. you can go at your own freewill; go wherever you like.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">With folded hands Vidyāsāgara said—Your majesty, all this is the outcome of my poor understanding. I tried to reply to the querries of the prince as earnestly as I could as per my knowledge and I do crave for your forgiveness for all this.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Viṣvaksena said—“I damn such an understanding of yours. You have nipped my dreams in the bud. I no more need your services.” Saying this he dismissed him from the post of minister.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana said—“Why do you do that, father? There is no fault of the minister in this matter. Whatever he said was only proper and that too was told by him in response to my querry. I do not possess enlightenment, dispassion and devotion in the minutest degree. But I do aspire to attain enlightenment, renunciation and devotion so that I too may seek redemption of my soul by becoming a great soul through seeking salvation while in the mortal existence. Blessed are those people who having developed dispassion from the world and through spending their lifetime in remembrance, meditation, association with the great souls, and the study of scriptures have sought beatitude for the soul. Please bless me so that having developed dispassion for body and the world, my mind should constantly and at all times dwell on God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At this king Viṣvaksena persuaded him in every possible way to divert him from his determination but all his arguments fell flat on him for the prince was a practicant who had fallen from the path of <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga</span> and the teachings of the minister too had exercised a great influence on his mind. The prince was obsessed with dispassion and completely ridding himself of egotism and attachment and remaining indifferent from the world began to spend his lifetime in seeking God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After sometime when he developed ardent dispassion and indifference, he became inherently quite indifferent to state affairs and approached the great soul from whom he had heard the following verse in his childhood—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> 13.8)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The meaning of this verse was clearly imprinted on his mind. He expressed to the great soul his desire for devotion, enlightenment and dispassion. Then thegreat soul consoled him and initiated him to the knowledge of devotion, knowledge and dispassion.</p>
<p class="Shlok">असक्तिरनभिष्वङ्ग: पुत्रदारगृहादिषु। </p>
<p class="Shlok">नित्यं च समचित्तत्वमिष्टानिष्टोपपत्तिषु॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">मयि चानन्ययोगेन भक्तिरव्यभिचारिणी।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विविक्तदेशसेवित्वमरतिर्जनसंसदि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">अध्यात्मज्ञाननित्यत्वं तत्त्वज्ञानार्थदर्शनम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> 13. 9—11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here the Lord means to say that on account of man’s close association with his wife, son, home, body and wealth etc., he is closely and unusually attached to them. Even after developing dispassion for sense enjoyments such as sound etc., the hidden feeling of attachment to them persists. So one should completely rid himself of attachment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The term <span class="char-style-override-11">‘अनभिष्वङ्ग’</span> means the absence of mineness. It is on account of this mineness that man develops close association with his wife, son etc. That is why he himself feels happy or sad in their happiness and grief, in their profit and loss respectively. The absence of attachment can be achieved only through the absence of mineness so man should develop absence of mineness in all such objects.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Contact with agreeable person, actions, events and objects and the disappearance of what is disagreeable is welcome to all. Similarly the disappearance of what is agreeable and contact with what is disagreeable is unwelcome. The absence of joy and grief etc., on coming in contact with what is agreeable or disagreeable that is the cessation of attachment, lust and joy etc., while coming in contact with what is agreeable and the disappearance of what is disagreeable and the absence of malice, grief, fear, anger etc., in the absence of what is agreeable and coming into contact with what is agreeable that is remaining unmoved, even-tempered and equipoised under all circumstances—this is what is meant by ‘equipoise of mind’ both in favourable and unfavourable circumstances.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Ananyayoga</span> means getting exclusively united with God as the highest of all beings and as one’s sole Lord, worth resorting  to the supreme goal, the highest refuge, one’s father, mother, brother and friend, the greatest benefactor, the nearest relation and everything and treating nobody else as one’s own—cultivating  steady, consummate and unadulterated love for God conceived of as above and practising constant remembrance of God and meditation on Him is what is meant by unflinching devotion to Him through ‘exclusive devotion.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The man who practises such a devotion, ceases to have any trace of selfishness or egotism in him and he no longer claims anything belonging to this world as his own. He is connected with the world only through God, he ceases to have any direct relation with any body. He views everything as belonging to God, and is constantly engaged in meditating on God in a disinterested spirit whatever he does, he does it only for the sake of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A spiritual practicant should reside in a secluded and lonely place such as a temple or a seat of austerity, the bank of a holy river like Gaṅgā, a sacred woodland, a mountain cave etc., which is free from bustle and noise and is uninhabited by others which when used as a residence, evokes no objection and causes no vexation to other which is free from dirt, refuse, pebbles and thorns which has lovely natural surroundings, which has a salubrious climate and a holy atmosphere which is free from infectious diseases and is not infested with carnivorous animals and which is free from violence and is surcharged with <span class="char-style-override-6">Sāttvika</span> vibrations is called <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Viviktadeśa’</span> and residing in such a place with the object of carrying on practices for self-realization is what is referred to here <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Viviktadeśasevitvam’</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A practicant must not take enjoyment in the company of men steeped in errors and attached to worldly enjoyments. Here the term <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Janasaṁsadi’</span> refers to the multitude of such worldly men as are <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Pramādī’</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Viṣayāsakta’</span>. Regarding the association with such men as positive hindrance in spiritual life is what is meant by finding no enjoyment in the company of men. Association with saints, exalted souls and aspirants on the other hand is helpful in spiritual practice and therefore <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Janasaṁsadi’</span> should not be taken to refer to such men.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The self is eternal, conscious, changeless and imperishable. All other objects which appear as perishable, material and subject to modification and change are non-self; the self has absolutely no relation with them. <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Adhyātma JÛānam’</span> or self-knowledge consists in thus realizing the truth of the Self through the scriptures and teaching of the preceptor. And conclusively determining this truth by the intellect and dwelling on it constantly and at all times with the mind is what is meant by fixity in self-knowledge. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The objects of true knowledge is the integral <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma </span>or God who is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss solidified for it is He who is realized through such knowledge. Constantly visualizing that transcendent reality as equally present everywhere is what is meant by seeing the object of true knowledge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Having thus, exhorted the prince, the great soul lapsed into silence. The prince, worthy as he was attained God, sooner by carrying on practices in accordance with the instruction of the great soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thither when the king awoke the next morning he came to know that the prince had given up the palace and gone somewhere the preceding night. A thorough search was made for him all round but he was not to be found anywhere. Then king Viṣvaksena was much grieved.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After sometime the king with a view to have his <span class="char-style-override-6">Darśana</span> approached the same great soul by whose religious performance the prince was born. The king  bowed in obeisance to the great soul and said—“The child I was blessed with through your grace, is missing for the last few days.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The great soul said—“Don’t you know that he has been staying with me for many days. He is constantly lost in the acquisition of knowledge and meditation on God. He has made his life a success I had foretold that this boy is a great soul of a high order endowed with dispassion and my prediction has turned into reality. O king, blessed is your life that you have begot such a son and blessed indeed is this son of yours.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hearing about the speedy and unexpected progress of the prince and seeing the state he has seen with his own eyes, the king was much astonished. The grief that arose in his heart on account of the prince’s giving up home, subsided. He now considered himself very fortunate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Next the king prayed to the great soul to enlighten him so that he may develop dispassion towards the body and the world. There upon the great soul cheerfully exhorted— </p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This verse denotes that complete absence of attachment for all the objects of enjoyment of this world and the next in the  form of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell which are relished by mind and the senses which though ignorantly regarded as source of delight, are really productive of sorrow and the complete absence of attachment for such enjoyments has been referred to here as <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam’ </span>that is cultivating dispassion towards the objects of enjoyments of this world and the next.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">‘Anahaṅkāra’</span> means complete absence of identification with the mind, intellect and the body which though other than the self are ignorantly regarded as the self. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The pangs of birth are no ordinary pangs. First of all the helpless <span class="char-style-override-6">Jīva </span>undergoes various forms of suffering for a considerable length of time in the womb of the mother. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Jīva</span> has to undergo the pangs of birth everytime it takes birth in the various forms of life. It has to undergo a lot of unbearable pains at the time of death also. One has to leave under compulsion the body and the home which one has regarded as one’s own for the whole life time. An idea of the agonies of death can be formed from the despondent looks and bodily sufferings of a dying person. The sufferings of the old age too are not negligible, the organs get enfeebled, the senses lose their power, the body  becomes worn out, the mind is ever tossed by longings of various kinds and one is rendered to a helpless condition. The hardships undergone in such a state are terrible. Even so the agonies of ailment too are extremely painful. The body gets emaciated, sufferings of various kinds become unbearable and one has to depend on others for so many things—the state of utter helplessness. These are the various forms of sufferings inherent in birth, death, old age and disease. To ponder again and again over the pains and evils inherent in birth, death, old age and disease and to reflect on them is to look upon them as full of sorrow. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Birth, death, old age and disease are undergone by <span class="char-style-override-6">Jīvas</span> as a result of their sins. Hence they are all full of evils. Hence constantly dwelling on this idea is what is meant by seeing evils in them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As a matter of fact with the exception of the conscious self there is nothing in the world which is free from these four evils. A house is built, this constitutes its birth, a part of it is broken, this constitutes its diseased condition, the broken part is repaired, the evil is remedied, the house becomes old, this represents its old age, it is now past repairs. Reaching the state of dilapidation it collapses, this represents its death. All things great and small must go through this process. Thus observing all objects of the world subject to birth, death, old age and disease one should cultivate dispassion towards them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being thus exhorted by the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā,</span> the king returned to his palace and began to practise the method preached by the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>. As a result the king developed extreme dispassion for his body and the world in a short time. Then the king approached the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> with the queen and said to him—“I have been greatly benefited through your exhortations. Now I desire to make Janārdana as the prince regent and spend the rest of my life on practising devotion and dispassion and acquiring knowledge”. At this <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span> called Janārdana and said to him—“Dear child, now take the reigns of administration of the state into your hands; for you there is no fear of any fall now. So now give leave to your father so that he might attain beatitude for himself through remembrance and meditation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Janārdana had already identified himself with God who is the embodiment of knowledge and Bliss. He began to manage the state affairs cheerfully as per order of his father. Now king Viṣvaksena alongwith his queen began to live in the association of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> and began to make sincere efforts to achieve the goal in accordance with the method taught by <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmājī</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day king Viṣvaksena having bowed at the feet of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> modestly and pathetically prayed to him—“O great soul, impart me such instructions in knowledge, devotion and dispassion so that I too may like Janārdana constantly and all the time stand identified with God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> instructed him in the same way as he had instructed Janārdana. On hearing the exhortations of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> both the king and the queen made spiritual practice with love reverence and great application as directed by him as a result both the king and the queen—attained God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">From this story we should take the lesson that like Janārdana we too should make our life a success through treading the path taught above by devoting the rest of our life to knowledge, dispassion, devotion, association with the great souls and the study of scriptures.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">The Easy Way of God-realization and the Secret and Influence of Love</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Mµuka CāṇÎāla rendered continuously loving service to his parents with reverence and devotion. By virtue of his rendering service with reverence and devotion, God Himself always stayed in his house in the guise of a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span>. As a result when the Mµuka CāṇÎāla departed for the Supreme Abode, he was accompanied to that place by his parents also. Far less to speak of it, the animals and insects that lived in his house also having assumed divine forms attained the Supreme Abode through his influence. What could be the influence at work behind all this? Surely it was the effect of the service rendered to the parents.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly there was a lady named śubhā, who would always render loving service to her husband with reverence and devotion through the influence of that service seated in a chariot she alongwith her husband departed to the Supreme Abode of the Lord. When the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> named Narottama witnessed all this he asked the Lord what the matter was. The Lord told him that Mµuka CāṇÎāla by virtue of his service to his parents and the lady named śubhā, by virtue of her service to her husband, are now departing for the Supreme Abode. That is why I dwell in houses of both of them assuming different forms. They have the knowledge of all the three times and they also know all about you. Thus he praised all the three things. There is an additional speciality about Mµuka CāṇÎāla. His house would swing into the air and did not touch the ground. The swinging of the house in the air and the knowledge of the three times—these are worldly accomplishments and something common a result of occult powers. But the fact that God Himself dwelt in his house and the departure of the animals and insects leaving his house to the Supreme Abode­—these are spiritual gains. It is valuable. We ought to pay greater attention to the real thing. The worldly accomplishments whether they are gained or not are not of much value. The Lord lifted the mount Gobardhana—it is a worldly accomplishment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a bridge was laid at <span class="char-style-override-6">Setubandh</span> Rāmeśwara large rocks were borne to the place by many monkeys such as Hanumān and others, but none assigned to them the name Giridhara (the upholder of mountain) but the name <span class="char-style-override-6">Giridhara</span> is assigned to the Lord. Usually great people are applauded. There is no speciality in it as the Lord was called Giridhara on account of holding a mount. Verily it was a worldly accomplishment. The Lord’s divine powers are as follows—to assume hundreds and thousands of forms, to bring about benediction to cows and mothers in the guise of calves and shepherd boys respectively. The Lord brought about benediction even to those who owned Him as their son. He is full of great compassion and limitless is His compassion. When Pµutanā having smeared her breasts with the deadliest of poison came to the Lord to make Him suck the poison owning Him as if He were her son (and she actually managed to do so) the Lord reflected thus—“She made me suck poison but wherein lies my duty? Verily My duty is to grant anyone salvation who approaches Me.” And the Lord did grant her redemption.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord śrī Rāmacandrajī granted redemption to all through the stream of the Sarayµu. The stream of the Sarayµu opened the way to redemption for all. He declared that whoever wanted to follow Him to His abode should bathe in the river Sarayµu and he would cross the ocean of worldly life whereas śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī by making all fight with one another with the help of grass known as <span class="char-style-override-6">Erakā</span> enabled them cross the worldly ocean. Lord śrī Rāmacandrajī granted redemption to all through the stream of Sarayµujī whereas śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī granted redemption to all by means of striking repeatedly with the help of the grass known as <span class="char-style-override-6">Erakā</span>. At the outset of the battle of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata</span> He took the pledge of not killing anyone on the battlefield for killing would ensure redemption. He displayed His prejudicial behaviour by bringing about redemption for the members of his family but denying it to those killed in the battle of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata</span> by getting them killed by others alone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Was there any motive behind it?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Aye, the reason is clear enough. Redemption must be sought for the family in which one is born.</p>
<p class="Shlok">कुलं पवित्रं जननी कृतार्था वसुन्धरा पुण्यवती च तेन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अपारसंवित्सुखसागरेऽस्मिँल्लीनं परे ब्रह्मणि यस्य चेत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Skand. Māhe. Kaumāra.</span> 55.140)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The verse means that hallowed is the clan through the association and the influence of association of that high souled man whose mind is merged in meditating upon the Absolute Reality who is the embodiment of knowledge, the ocean of bliss and whose bliss is boundless like the sea. And the mother who gives him birth certainly attains salvation. The ground where he rests his feet is hallowed. When such is the impact of the devotees it is but natural that God should excel them. God exhorts us to do good even to him who illtreats you. The Lord sets an example before us by granting redemption to Pµutanā. One may ask that if he granted redemption to Pµutanā who intended to poison Him what would He offer to Yaśodā who fed Him with nectar like milk? Deliverance is the highest thing He can bestow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, there is one thing greater than even deliverance.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is that?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God in his embodied form is such. Therefore God Himself dedicated his own self to Yaśodā. Through playing in her courtyard, through loving her affectionately as her own child and surrendering Himself to her the dust of her courtyard which we call earth was impregnated with benediction. The result was that whomsoever Yaśodā would give a handful of dust, attained deliverance or if someone took the dust by himself he too would attain deliverance for the dust is impregnated with divinity. Yaśodā would give away the gift of deliverance at all times—whoever approached her he attained benediction. Hence Yaśodā stands on a higher pedestal than He and her position is like that of śivajī in Kāśī. Anyone who visits Kāśī and expires there, is granted deliverance by śivajī. Such dispensation is indeed excellent. A story of depicting such magnanimity is often told.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> who was very generous at heart. This is a mere story and not a statement of facts but we are concerned only with the moral it conveys. Story though it is it contains an exemplary moral.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once upon a time an elephant approached Yamarāja (the god of death). Yamarāja began jesting with him and said—You do have a body like a mountain. How is it that you were tamed by a small creature like man.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The elephant said—Sire, little to speak of me even you can be subjugated by man and even God also. None but man is a creature who can entice even God. He can prevail upon you even. Where do I stand for him?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yamarāja said—O king among the elephants! but thousands of men come to me everyday.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The elephant said—Sire, those come here only after their death, as for me, I was under the control of a living man. Perhaps you haven’t come in contact with a living man. But if ever you came in contact with his species, it was Sāvitrī who won you over. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On hearing this Yamarāja asked his messengers to bring to him a living man. Those messengers arrived at the house of a <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> in the night. It was summer. He was lying on his cot on the floor of his three storeyed palatial building. Holding the four legs of the cot by their hands the angels flew off through the sky. As the angels flew off with him, he woke up. When he found himself lying on his cot and floating in the air, he wondered what a nightmare it is. He reflected that if he moved sideways he would fall down and meet his doom but he must see who it could be. When he projected his face and looked around he guessed the presence of messengers of Yama. He thought to himself—the angels of Yama take away men after their death but they are carrying me away although I am still alive could it be that I were dreaming. No, no, it can’t be a dream for I am awake and sitting erect. He further reflected—Could it be that my mind is obsessed with delusion? No, no, there is hardly any scope for delusion. Everything was realistic he concluded. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> asked the angels where they were carrying him. The angels replied that they were carrying him to Yama. At once an idea struck his mind. He took out from his pocket a pencil and a piece of paper and wrote a letter to Dharmarāja thus—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Let Yamarāja accept the compliments of Lord Hari conveyed hereby. I am sending this new steward. Please manage the affairs in accordance with his instructions”. And in the end wrote śrī Hari at the place where signature is usually affixed. Then he put it into his pocket. The angels of Yama brought him to the court in that very state. The court was not being held at that time. They put the cot down on the meeting place. Now it was morning. The morning hours having passed, the courtiers gathered. Yamarāja came in. He is known by two names—Yamarāja and Dharmarāja. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> presented to him the letter written by himself. By chance the letters of the note conformed to the writing of Hari and the signature at the end tallied with the signature of śrī Hari. No sooner did he go through the note than he got up at once and with palms joined requested him to be seated. Yamarāja made him sit on the plank and himself sat down at his feet. Now things were managed under the instructions of the steward. Now Sinners poured in. Citraguptajī was sitting nearby. Yamarāja wanted to know from Citragupta about a particular sinner as to who he was and what his case was. Citragupta emphatically replied that he was a <span class="char-style-override-6">Baniyā</span> (a man of business class).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Kāyastha who was enacting as a steward wanted to know what business he was carrying on Citragupta said that his conduct was full of falsehood, deceit, hoarding, dishonesty and was althrough sinful. Falsehood was predominant in all dealings of his life—buying, selling, eating and breakfasting.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The steward said—“Ay! one can resort to falsehood in buying and selling but how can one resort to it in eating and drinking?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—“Sir, these days foodgrains have been brought under control. If fine foodgrains are brought from other places there is fear of its being seized by the government. So the gentleman surely eats wheat and rice but declares that at present he eats mixed grains that is he eats cheap grain known as <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Bejhad’</span>. Thus they tell a lie. Hence eating and drinking also come within the purview of falsehood.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Kāyastha said—Well, what should be done in this case?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—Sir, he should be hurled into the horrible hell called <span class="char-style-override-6">Kumbhīpāka.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Kāyastha said—“Don’t you know?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—What?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Kāyastha said—Let him go to the supreme abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—Sir, he does not deserve to be sent there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Kāyastha said—“Don’t interfere. Let the work go on.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A milkmaid came there after sometime. About her Citragupta said—“Sir, this milkmaid was selling milk. The milk she sells makes children sick.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“How does it happen?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—She adulterates milk with arrowroot. She mixes water of the pond with the milk and the water being mixed with clay makes the children sick. Thus she has been doing a great sin. She cheats people. She does injustice to those children who are fed with milk. According to our convention we hurl such beings into hell called <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Raurava’.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“No, no, let her enter the Divine Abode. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—She too in the divine abode!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—Only you keep on witnessing. Anybody who comes here send him to divine abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After sometime a <span class="char-style-override-6">Kalawāra</span> (one who sells distilled liquors) came there.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Who is he?” said the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta replied that he was a <span class="char-style-override-6">Kalawāra.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“What are his antecedents?” enquired the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—“He had a still-house for distilling liquors. Your majesty knows well that the drinking of wine is much the same as the killing of a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span>. This fellow deals in wine day and night. He has publicized the use of liquors on a large scale. Thousands of men have been made impious on account of a widescale use of liquors. He deserves to be thrown in the hell known as Mahātāmisra.” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—Send him to the Supreme Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Will he too be allowed to enter the Supreme Abode?” exclaimed Citragupta.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whoever, comes here shall be sent to the Supreme Abode”, said the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span>. Then came up a butcher.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Who is he?” enquired the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta replied—“Your majesty, he runs a slaughter house. On an average he butchers thousand cows everyday. He has butchered lakhs nay crores of cows during his life time. Your majesty, he undoubtedly deserves to be hurled into Hell known as <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Mahāraurava’.</span> But your will is supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Let him also go to the Supreme Abode,” said the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said­—Your majesty does not make any deliberation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“You need not bother about it. Do not make any interrogation now. Let anyone who comes be sent to the Supreme Abode. Let a large queue be made.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then came a prostitute.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Citragupta said—Your majesty, she is a prostitute. She tempts a number of people to deviate from the path of <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Don’t speak anything. Let her directly go to the Supreme Abode, observed the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord noticed that there was a large queue of men seeking entrance into the Supreme Abode and the number of comers was still increasing. The Lord wondered why so many of them were seeking entrance into the Supreme Abode. Could it be that the practice of devotion had become as popular as it was with king Kīrtimān. On a second thought he concluded that the practice of devotion had not become more popular. It was the same as it was before. When his thoughts went to Yamaloka He visualized that the injustice prevailed there. Some <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> was occupying the chair there and it was he who was sending everyone to the Supreme Abode. The Lord ran upto Yamarāja. Noticing the presence of Lord everyone rose from his seat. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> also followed suit. Making the Lord sit on the plank all others sat on the ground.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Why is there so much of injustice in your realm, O Yamarāja?” asked the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Dharmarāja said—“Most revered one, this injustice started since you sent this new steward here. You can examine all the ledgers maintained before hand—you won’t find any instance of injustice.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Where is the new steward?” enquired the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Certainly he is sitting before you,” replied Yamarāja.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord enquired—“Where from hast thou come here and how did thou manage to do so?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“Your majesty is asking ‘how’ and ‘why’, it was You who sent me here.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord then enquired of Yamarāja—“How did you believe that he was sent by me?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here is Your letter, you can look at it Yourself, said Yamarāja. When the Lord looked at it he found it genuine.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord asked Yamarāja—“By whom has this letter been written?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It was written by Your goodself”, replied the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha.</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—I had never any meeting with you. How could then the letter be written?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“You dwell in everyone’s heart, my Lord. You Yourself have declared in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो-</p>
<p class="Shlok">मत्त: स्मृतिर्ज्ञानमपोहनं च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वेदैश्च सर्वैरहमेव वेद्यो-</p>
<p class="Shlok">वेदान्तकृद्वेदविदेव चाहम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XV.15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is I who remain seated in the heart of all creatures as the inner controller of all and it is I who am the source of memory, knowledge and the ratiocinative faculty. Again I am the only object worth knowing through the <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedas</span>. I alone am the father of <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedānta</span> and the knower of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedas</span> too.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was after knowledge had dawned upon my heart and memory and thoughts were at work that I could write such a letter. None but you were the source of inspiration, nevertheless you want to know who inspired me. The Lord said—It’s all right but why after all have you done all this? You have really done a great injustice by sending everyone who came here, to the Supreme Abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> spoke thus—“Your Majesty, I had anticipated that I wasn’t going to get this chair and rank forever. Hence I must do whatever I can, within the time at my disposal. I have made it a rule not to send anyone to the Hell, instead send them to the Supreme Abode.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“But you did injustice by sending the evil-doers to the Supreme Abode, protested the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“Supposing that I did injustice, you are at liberty to send them back. But mind before sending them back you will have to withdraw many verses from the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord asked why He will have to do so.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“You have stated that anyone who attains your Supreme Abode does not return to this world for your Supreme Abode has been spoken of as unmanifest, indestructible and the Supreme goal—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अव्यक्तोऽक्षर इत्युक्तस्तमाहु: परमां गतिम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यं प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> VIII. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“If anyone is forced to return from your Supreme Abode after attaining it, this verse will have to be withdrawn from Your <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“What a cunning fellow has come up!” remarked the Lord and asked who he was.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am a <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha”</span> was the reply.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—You are a <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> that is why you are so witty otherwise you couldn’t have managed to have so much of wit. Well, what is done cannot be undone. O Dharmarāja, I am now departing. You ought to perform your duties properly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yamarāja politely ascended. Thereafter when the Lord intended to depart therefrom, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> too became ready to start with him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord enquired, where he intended to go.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He replied that he intended to go wherever He would go.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord enquired, “why he intended to do so.” The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—You yourself have said to Arjuna in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—All the beings coming to <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahmaloka</span> are liable to return. But O son of Kuntī, on attaining Me there is no rebirth.</p>
<p class="Shlok">आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोका: पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> VIII. 16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The beings attaining the regions like <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahmaloka</span> are liable to return. One is obliged to return from here for it is lower region ruled by Yamarāja. But as I have realized you, I will not have to return. Having realized you I won’t have to return from here. If you compel me to return the veracity of the statement contained in this verse will be falsified.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord reluctantly asked him to accompany Him when the Lord was about to depart further asked Yamarāja to tell Him how this creature could make an access to that place. Then Yamarāja related to him the whole story.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Yamarāja said—Revered sir, one day it so happened that I started jesting with the elephant sitting on the opposite side. I taunted how did he come under the domination of a man although his body was huge like mountain. He remarked that even God as well as I could come under the domination of man. When I told him that men come to me almost everyday he remarked that they do come but they don’t come alive. At this out of fun I ordered the angels to bring a living man perhaps it were they who had brought that man. At this the Lord called for the angels and asked them if they had brought that man here.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The angels replied that it was they who had brought him to that place. Then in the presence of God, Yamarāja asked them why they did not inform me that they had brought him to that place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The angels said—“Revered sir, we did not get leave to inform you. He arrived, handed over a note to you. You stood up with palms joined together and offered him your seat and your office. All of us noticed this and thought to ourselves that he might be some acquaintance. There wasn’t any chance to inform you.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the elephant said—Respected sirs, didn’t I say that not only God but also you could be dominated by man. Weren’t both of you dominated—God as well as yourself? The Lord and Yamarāja both said—“Very well”. Thereafter when the Lord as well as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> were about to start the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“Well, be good enough to take with you this elephant also who is sitting with his trunk raised upward. Give revered Yamarāja his chair; I have no objection. I do not aspire for the chair of Yamarāja and the like.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord asked why he should take the elephant with Me.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> said—“He too has had your <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana.</span> Shall he remain confined to <span class="char-style-override-6">Yamaloka</span> even after having your <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana?”</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“Take him also with you.” Then the Lord instructed them to perform their duties as usual and dispense justice in accordance with ‘Law’. He also remarked that what was done could not be undone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If anyone happens to ask what sort of intellect a <span class="char-style-override-6">VaiÜya</span> possessed I must say that he is sharp witted. But I am certainly a <span class="char-style-override-6">VaiÜya</span> by caste. But if willy-nilly God grant me some rank I should also adopt the tactics of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha</span> I shouldn’t lag behind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Someone remarked that it was already conferred. It has not been bestowed yet but it can be had by the grace of God for by His grace God can raise a mosquito to the rank of the creator and reduce the creator as low as a mosquito. Tulasīdāsa puts the idea thus—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मसकहिं करइ बिरंचि प्रभु अजहि मसक ते हीन।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God wields such influence that He can reduce one to any state at his pleasure. None of us wields such powers. No miracle, no influence—nothing of the sort yet He can make one what He likes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the question is what method should be adopted to attain that greatness. There is a parable which can reveal the way. There was a devotee who was exclusively devoted to God and adored Him with body, mind, money and made a total surrender to God. Whatever he did with the spirit of self-surrender was done by him as if it were a duty to God. For when an action is performed as duty to God one is full of pleasure all the time and one is not fatigued. Laughingand dancing and joyfully did everything at all times as work of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How could he manage to work round the clock? Did he not go to bed?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Well, even in his dreams he found himself working as hard as he worked during the day. Thus he went on working round the clock. Such was the state of that devotee that God granted him His <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana</span> manifestedly and after granting him vision He asked him to seek any boon of his desire.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee said—My Lord, does any desire remain unfulfilled after having your <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana?</span> Is there anything superior to you? Why should I then ask for anything other than you?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“Whatever you say is all right. But do ask for something for My satisfaction. And ask only for the thing which appeals to you most.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee said—All right, “O Lord. Since you have thrown the responsibility upon me to seek the boon of my choice so I ask for universal redemption.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—Well, if I grant redemption to all who will suffer consequences of the evils? One can of course forego the merit and offer them all to Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa by saying <span class="char-style-override-11">‘‘श्रीकृष्णार्पणमस्तु’’</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span>by dedicating everything to the Lord. If we dedicate all our meritorious deeds to the Lord the outstanding balance will be ‘Nil’. But the consequences of our evil deeds can be wiped out only through making repentance or suffering their consequences or through spiritual discipline. How can one attain deliverance till the sins remain outstanding. Who else will suffer for his sins?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee said—Well, my Lord, Let me undergo the evil consequences of the sins committed by all; free them all. Inflict  punishment on me and let me undergo it. All the sins thus suffered by me will perish one day.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—Well you are my devotee, shall I instead of granting you boon make you undergo the evil consequence of  others’ sins?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee replied—“If what you say is correct, being so compassionate, ocean of compassion and supremely compassionate why don’t you be compassionate and grant redemption to all?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“That is impossible indeed.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee said—“Nothing is impossible, you presume it to be impossible but surely indeed you can make the impossible possible for you are the supreme Deity and the Oversoul. God is indeed so powerful, that He can make the impossible possible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“I will accept my defeat in my discussion  with you on this matter.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee said—“My Lord, it matters little if you accept your defeat. If this is beyond your powers, you should have persuaded me to ask for wife, progeny, money or deliverance. It wasn’t proper to say that I should ask for anything I desired. If it laybeyond your powers why did you say that way and if it lies within your power, you must grant whatever I have asked for.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“Well, I stand defeated and you have become victorious.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee said—“My Lord, of what avail is such a victory to me? I didn’t actually gain even a penny. Let the defeat be on my side. Everyone must be granted redemption. Such a victory is indeed meaningless as cannot bring  about the well-being of even a single person.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“Well, man attains benediction through My <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana,</span> touch, conversation with Me, reflecting on Me, the constant repetition of My names, meditation on Me, or having any other sort of contact with Me and I grant the same ability  and power to you. Beings can attain benediction through your <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana, </span>speech, touch, conversation, reflection on you and pronouncing your name as well. You may at your discretion grant redemption to as many as you desire. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee began to reflect thus—“Well I haven’t achieved my goal but I should accept whatever the Lord is pleased to give. If the Lord does not intend to grant redemption to all without discrimination, I must reconcile myself with whatever He is pleased to grant.” So he reconciled himself with whatever was granted by the Lord. This is only a parable.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Previously it was stated that none could be lucky enough to be granted such authority as was granted to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kāyastha.</span> But the time allotted to him was as short as three days. King Kīrtimān was, however, allotted more time than him and there is one post still vacant to get redemption for all till now. If someone could fill that post all of us might have attained redemption. Now the question is that who is eligible to such post. One who cherishes such feelings as were entertained by the devotee whose story I have narrated above can fill up that post. Only such men as entertain such feelings to that they should be made suffer the punishment for others’ sins and redemption should be granted to them who have a heart full of so much of generosity, such disinterestedness and such dispassion, are granted such authority. There can be hardly any scope for objection. If a man possessing such supreme mercy and good will is placed on a higher pedestal than even God himself for the glory of the devotees has been sung this—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मोरें मन प्रभु अस बिस्वासा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">राम ते अधिक राम कर दासा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Rāmacaritamānasa VII.</span> 120.16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such is the glory of the devotees. They are ever ready to strive for others’ well-being and to undergo the evil consequences of evil deeds done by others—not only of individual but of the entire world. How can God make His devotees suffer punishment? The idea was the fulfilment of his desire. Surely the Lord’s intention was not to let one undergo punishment. God’s intention is only to test others. He does so for the sake of testing others on the touchstone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the topic of love of God which was taken up at the very outset remains inconclusive. Although these things which have been discussed above, also fall within the preview of love of God. Now we are going to deal with inordinate love, Rādhikājī  stands supreme among the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs.</span> The sentiments of love she nourished are not to be found among the people of the present times. The outward show is there in abundance. But the true feeling of love which Rādhājī nourished remains unexplored.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The genuine feelings of love of śrī Rādhājī still remain a matter of conjecture. Five thousand years ago when Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī had incarnated himself, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> were there. Rādhikājī was there and Love incarnate was dancing afoot.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But question may be raised as to why it was dancing afoot in the embodied form then and has stopped doing so now. Our humble submission is that God had incarnated himself then but if He descends on earth the same position may be restored. Secondly, God alone had not incarnated himself even the devotees had incarnated. And What about the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs?</span> Some say that sages such as Bālkhilya and others had incarnated themselves as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs.</span> According to the opinion of someone they were the incarnation of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Ürutis</span> of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedas.</span> Some say that the devotees dwelling in the Supreme Abode of the Lord incarnated  themselves as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs.</span> In this way love incarnate danced afoot. Love, object of love and lover—all the three are invariably the same. It is love alone which assumes three forms. Considered from the Lord’s side the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> are the object of love and the Lord is the lover and in case of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs,</span> the Lord is the object of love and the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> are the lovers. And it is love that correlates them. Love is the strand that conjoins them. We must bear in mind that the three things existed there although love existed there in the abstract form of sentiment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At that time God had incarnated himself and His retinue had also descended upon the earth with Him. This story is often heard; it might owe its origin to some myth, I have not come across it; I have only heard it from others. The story runs thus— Once upon a time when (Kāmadeva) the cupid cast his spell on Nāradajī, he said to Kāmadeva—O Kāmadeva, you couldn’t spare even me. At least you must have spared me. The saying goes that even a witch spares one house. ‘But I don’t spare even one’ replied he.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nāradajī asked—Didn’t you ever come across a man who would conquer you?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He said—“I haven’t yet come across a man who could conquer  me. I have overpowered even śivaji, little to speak of a man like you. I can overpower even God. This tall talk of Kāmadeva was too much for Nāradajī. Nāradajī approached Lord Viṣṇu and said—“O Lord, don’t you often declare that you do not let anybody nurse pride?” Hearing this the Lord wanted to know from him what exactly the matter was.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nāradajī said—Kāmadeva is at present very much inflated with pride. He asserts that he is unconquerable in the world for he has overpowered śivajī and can overpower even God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“Well, Nārada, go and tell him that I will conquer him and try to know from him whether he would like to engage himself in a battle on the field or he would like to fight in a fortified place. If someone goes to a forest or retires into a cave and observes continence till the end of life, it means one is fighting in a fortified place and overpowering lust while living in the midst of womenfolk is the same as fighting on the battlefield. Nāradajī went and approached Kāmadeva and conveyed the message. Kāmadeva said—“None can conquer me even in a fortified place far less to speak of conquering me on the field”. Nāradajī conveyed Kāmadeva’s reaction to the Lord. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord said—“Nārada, go and tell him that during My incarnation as Kr̥ṣṇa I shall engage myself in a battle with him on the field and I will win. So he must beware.” Thus, the Lord cautioned Kāmadeva by sending this message to him through Nārada. Then having incarnated himself He married with sixteen thousand one hundred and eight queens. It is said that lakhs of sons were born to them and He had inordinate love for the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs.</span> Twofold love—<span class="char-style-override-6">Svakīyā</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Parakīyā</span> has been displayed there, for example the love of Rukmiṇī and others can be classified as <span class="char-style-override-6">Svakīyā</span> whereas the love of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> was <span class="char-style-override-6">Parakīyā</span>. They were the wives of other people and they nourished friendly love for the Lord. The type of love that a male cherishes for another female and in case of His own wives it was based on co-relationship. The love of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Svakīyā</span> type was represented by Rukmiṇījī and the <span class="char-style-override-6">Parakīyā </span>type was represented by śrī Rādhikājī. The chief among the first type were the eight chief queens and among the other group were the eight female friends. There were several thousands of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> and thousands of queens while sporting with these wives of other people He gave a proof of His chaste conduct. He humbled the pride of Kāmadeva. The appearance of lust in case of the Lord was not the least conceivable. He even exterminated lust from the hearts of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> and as far His own wives were concerned, He stayed with them unaffected by lust and even while co-existing with them lived a detached life like king Janaka who was a great soul endowed with learning and this way of life should be assumed as battle fought on the field with the cupid.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God himself came upon the earth with His retinue for he had to crush the pride of Kāmadeva. It was for the purpose of humbling the pride of Kāmadeva that the Lord incarnated himself and it was verily the incarnation of love all being the embodiments of love. The object before the Lord was that whatever divine plays or activities He was going to perform must be morally sound, sanctioned by <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span> and the scriptures pure and sanctified and sentiment of love is to be enhanced in a great degree.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It was for the purpose of promoting love that the Lord veiled Brahmājī, deluded his wits and Brahmājī stealthily took away the calves and the cowherd boys, subsequently the Lord assumed various forms. In His variegated aspects the Lord caused to flow such a stream of love that even animals were surfeited with love. Not only men but also the trees were steeped in love. In trees surfeiting love was visible in such phenomenon as the yielding of fruit without season and oozing of juice from them at the sight of the Lord. Such was the display of love that even the cows began to shed milk for the sake of the Lord who had assumed the aspect of a calf. There is hardly anything to be astonished at in such a phenomenon for God is Love Incarnate. If even the cows become affectionate for the sake of the Lord there is nothing to be astonished at, nay, they are even affectionate to the grown up calves—say two to four year old calves whom they had stopped feeding milk a year or two years ago. At the sight of this phenomenon Baladevajī was much surprised and said—“It is rather supernatural, it is unconventional, it is not inherent in nature. What could be the cause thereof? He began to reflect. He also observed the strange behaviour of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopas</span>—the cowherds—the son of one of them does some mischief, he approaches his son in order to punish him but when he approaches the son he bursts into laughter which makes him laugh too, his wrath vanishes altogether, he would take him into his arms and hug him, the feeling of anger would transform into feeling of affection. Noticing such strange phenomenon when Baladevajī  began to reflect and noticed the calves and the cowherd boys were Kr̥ṣṇa Himself. Then he asks the Lord what the matter was. The Lord explained to him since Brahmājī stealthily kidnapped away all the calves and the cowherd boys. He having assumed multitudinous forms was enacting the divine play. Only then he came to his wits.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Assuming various forms He played such a divine concert that love became the motive force for all those who lived there—the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopas,</span> the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs,</span> the cows and the calves—the same unadulterated love for all—the cowherds, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs,</span> the mothers of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopas</span> and the cows as well love imbued with friendliness  for the Gopas and the Gopīs and love marked with affectionateness for the mothers of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopas</span> as well as of the calves. A stream of love flowed as it were at that time and love overflowed its banks. At that time all the activities of the Lord were directed with a view to providing bliss to the loving souls granting blissfulness, enticing them prompting inordinate love and the only object before the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> was to seek pleasure of the Lord and enhancing their love of the Lord. Thus love incarnate danced about. The object before both of them was invariably the same. As for the Lord, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> were the object of love and in case of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> it was Lord who was the object of love. In fact all the three—love, lover and the object of love are essentially identical. The incarnation of Lord Kr̥ṣṇa was the incarnation of excelled love. Rādhikājī was the foremost among all the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> at that time. Rādhikājī far from being at par with Rukmiṇījī possessed higher excellence than her. Rukmiṇījī was the mistress of wealth and glory and she would dole out prosperity to all whereas Rādhikājī was the mistress of love and she doled out love to all. Rādhikājī was the embodiment of love—it was love that had incarnated itself as Rādhikājī and again it was love that had incarnated itself as śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. Things can be put this way also that śrī Kr̥ṣṇa is the very embodiment of the integral <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> the embodiment of Truth, Bliss and Knowledge whereas Rādhikājī was the embodiment of divine Bliss who afforded His excessive delight.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are two supreme powers—one that confers wealth and glory and the other that confers rapture. The supreme power that affords love to Him who bestows joy and love on the earth is known as <span class="char-style-override-6">‘ hlādinī śakti’</span> (enrapturing power). Thus the incarnation of Rādhājī was the incarnation of that enrapturing power. That was why love danced about in embodied form. At present even its glimpse is far to seek. Still whatever is often said to you in this  regard fails to adequately describe the reality.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The reality evades our intellect for we lack the desirable intellectual powers. Just as Tulasīdāsa confesses that being dull-witted he cannot portray the meeting between Bharata and Rāma for a musical instrument strung with chords made of <span class="char-style-override-6">‘GāÎara’ </span>(a kind of grass) fails to produce sonorous sound, so also the reality lies beyond the power of speech and one fails to have even a glimpse of it. The veracity of such an assertion is undisputable. Love which is often referred to as ‘unadulterated love’, ‘wholehearted love’ and ‘undivided love’ but the tendency of using such terms can safely be called as ‘playing on words’ (verbosity) but the fact is that it does not come within the grasp of intellect. The aspect of love of God as the embodiment of love or of both, incarnations of both—Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī, the very embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss and Rādhikājī the power that affords Him blissfulness, does not come within the purview of the intellect in the same way as ocean cannot be contained in a pitcher—the effort to confine the ocean into a pitcher is certainly foolish for it cannot be confined within a pitcher. The pity is that our intellects are not even so good containers as pitchers. Whatever is grasped by the intellect is not clearly understood. Far less to speak of its reproduction—that aspect of love cannot aptly be portrayed even through a well designed example, it is beyond the flight of fancy. Mind has not the capacity to aptly describe it either through devising a parable or giving examples. Whatever is worth knowing through intellect, can neither be explained through allegorical description or through exemplification. The nearest access though we may have, the subtlest picture though we may draw in our mind of the picturesque panorama, it will take one hours and hours to describe what one has perceived in a moment. The picture that we draw with our inward eye hardly takes a moment to draw almost the time we take in opening our eyelids but it takes one long to appreciate it. Tongue is of course not so powerful as the mind. If one takes a portrait of the Lord and tries to explain to the artist the points of beauty from head to foot including the beauty of His hands and feet, the artist realises within the twinkling of an eye he visualizes the picture but it will certainly take long if the details of that supernal beauty were verbally explained to him. Certainly it would take too much of time to make an exposition of a picture portrait painted on a piece of paper. One finds it oneself unable to explain the portrait for it is an extraordinary one. Then the question that baffles over mind is what we should do in the matter.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What we ought to do in this regard is to select the best portrait out of the lot of good ones that are available in the world or that one which appeals to our intellect most and concentrates on the divine aspect of Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī or the deity of one’s choice be Lord śiva or Lord śrī Rāma or Lord Viṣṇu makes little difference for the divine name, śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī has been referred to here only as an instance and meditate on Him on the basis of that portrait. The object of one’s meditation, however, should not be the portrait itself but one should try to visualize the aspect of śrī Kr̥ṣṇajī in analogy of the divine aspect portrayed therein for the portrait is nonsentient whereas the Lord is all consciousness in analogy of body and the soul that dwells therein. Suppose someone photographs me and puts the photograph before me one would obviously notice the difference between my photograph and me for I can speak, talk move about at my will, can make indications with the movement of eyes but that photograph of mine cannot do anything of this sort. Just as my photograph and I are dissimilar so are the portrait of the Lord and the Lord Himself dissimilar rather the dissimilarity in the latter one is too subtle.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now the question arises as to why the portrait of the Lord utterly fails to describe the reality. Suppose we are successful in drawing a realistic portrait of the Lord, the features are outlined properly but how can the gestures and postures, the qualities etc., be invested with the portrait, surely we would fail to do so. You can certainly photograph me embodied as I am but the portraits of the Lord that are available to us are surely not the photographs of the divine aspect of the embodiment of the Lord and that makes all the difference. Well, whenever we require assistance  in the matter the portrait is there to assist us but the things that are lacking in the portrait e.g., gestures and postures, love, qualities etc., we may resort to the words of great souls and the scriptures. We can take hints from them to vest our portrait with such qualities. Such is the divine aspect nay, it is all the more peculiar just as my body is devoid of consciousness but the soul that dwells within is all conscious—the body is the matter whereas the latter is the spirit. But the very form of the Lord is endowed with consciousness. He is the embodiment of consciousness. Not only the body but all the things. His divine form is vested with such as the weapons, garments, ornaments and the garlands etc., are all endowed with consciousness. Hence both differ very much from each other. The divine aspect meditated upon should be deemed to be vested with all these qualifications and should meditate upon that aspect all the time.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But if someone says—“Well, you have suggested to assume  that way but how can we attain perfection by turning our assumption into conviction?” Our humble suggestion is that a beginner should proceed in the following manner.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">When one perceives the portrait with one’s eyes, one should find oneself helpless in withdrawing one’s eyes from it. If God at His will conceals himself from view or disappears the matter is quite different but as far as possible one should be reluctant  to withdraw one’s eyes from it. The other thing is that one should look at it with unblinking eyes—continue to gaze at it. Thirdly one should suppose both he and the Lord are looking at each other and love is the main cause of this mutual exchange  of looks. Love is formless and love is after all love, efforts should be made to make that love unshakable through ocular perception i.e., one should constantly visualise the divine form and the divine form should be conceived as if looking at him. At such a moment the body is filled with cheerfulness, the heart with delight, the eyes are marked with gaiety and signs of horripilation suddenly begin to appear. At first when for the first time one feels He is approaching one should visualize that one is making obeisance to the Lord and the Lord in response to it is taking one up in His arms and embracing him just as Lord Rāma gathered Bharatajī up into His arms when revered Bharata went to Citrakµu¢a and fell at his feet. Likewise we can fall at the feet of Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa and visualize Him taking us up into His arms and embracing us. We fall at the feet of the Lord and He embraces us. We make obeisance at the revered feet of the Lord and He embraces us. In both instances touch followed the vision of the Lord. Communion took place only after touch. While holding communion one should feel astonishment at that state—a humble man like him standing in close proximity to the most sublime and reflecting again and again on the divine compassion, love and mercy one should be overwhelmed with blissfulness. For sometime during mutual communion one should be rendered speechless and then composing oneself one should resume the conversation as was the case with Sutīkṣṇajī. On noticing the presence of the Lord and being overwhelmed Sutīkṣṇajī fell at the revered feet of the Lord and was rendered speechless for quite a while. Subsequently he sang hymns to the Lord. Thus during his spiritual practice he offered prayer to God and then held conversation with the Lord—the same sort of conversation as we hold among ourselves. Having attained that state one should directly ask the Lord how is the vision attainable. The Lord would say that it is attainable through love. He should again ask Him how is that love attainable. He would reply that it is attainable through reverence. Likewise one should converse with Him in the way one pleases, of course, according to one’s impulse and sentiments and should conceive that the Lord himself in His divine form is answering the questions, His lips are stirring, He is speaking and answering the questions and we are hearing Him. Whatever is being heard is surely not being heard by our physical self. Both have a psychic entity. The perception, speech and talks are psychically conducted by the psychic entities of both. This—His vision, speech talk and the reflection on Him—all are supernatural. The fine fragrance that is emitted by Him is also unearthly. The fragrance that suffuse Him is nectar to the nose, His vision is like nectar to the eyes, his touch is like nectar to hands and other limbs, His words are nectarean to the ears. His vision, touch, speech, talk and fragrance etc., are all nectarean to the senses. Thus one should mentally perceive and meditate on Him everyday—once a day, twice a day or even five times a day. By carrying on spiritual practice in this way whatever is achieved at first is only mental. Through mental resolve or we may call it our sentiment and if this sentiment strengthens in due course of time it ceases to be a sentiment only—it becomes manifest.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-12">The Fruit of Faith in God’s Limitless Compassion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A story is often heard about the divine compassion. The story runs thus—There was a high souled man who was a recluse. Once he went to a householder’s house to ask for alms. At his door he called aloud ‘Nārāyaṇa Hari’. The householder was inside the house. He came out, with palms joined together  fell at his feet and began to weep. The great soul asked—“Why do you weep? The householder said—“Sire, there is none in the world so grief-stricken and impoverished as I. I can’t describe how poor and grieved I am.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The cause of my weeping is that you came to my house, called aloud ‘Nārāyaṇa Hari’ and thereby inspired me to give alms but needless it is to say that the members of my family are going without food for the last three days, there is utter lack of foodgrains in the house. The city folk helped me a lot, lent me money also. After all how long could the benevolent people support us so we are compelled to go without food for the last three days. There is none so poor, helpless, destitute and hunger-striken like us.” At this the great soul remarked—“None in the world is so rich as you are, you can make anyone wealthy at your will. You can make even a pauper rich and can make a destitute affluent by removing his poverty—such are your powers. The householder said that I have no such power, no such magic power, what you say I can’t follow. The householder said—Sire, you declare me to be the richest but I think myself to be the poorest of all—the most helpless man upon the earth but whatever you say is quite contrary to the facts. The great soul said—“Look, what is it that you have in your house here?” ‘A piece of stone for grinding with a muller,’ replied the housekeeper. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> picked up the muller and said—“What is it made of? “It is a piece of stone,” replied the housekeeper. The revered <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> argued that he did not regard it as a piece of stone. It is upto you to accept or deny it but I can make thousands of people swear that it is but a piece of stone, asserted the house-keeper.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“Am I to believe the statement of a thousand men or should I believe in what I see with my own eyes?” The householder said—“Sire, I am at a loss to understand what to do, defect seems to lie with your eyes. The householder enquired “Do you find it something else? Don’t you see this as stone? The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“The defect does not lie with my eye sight it lies with your eye sight. Have you ever heard the name of <span class="char-style-override-6">Pārasa</span> (the philosopher’s stone)?” “I have heard that name and have also heard its effect as well,” replied the householder. “What did you hear?” enquired the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>. I had heard that if iron is brought into contact with stone called <span class="char-style-override-6">Pārasa,</span> iron is transmuted into gold, said the householder. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said “It is that very thing. Have you any iron pot into your house?” The housekeeper replied “Yes sire, there are tongs, pincers, ladle, bucket and also the round iron plate for baking bread, Sire, I am a householder and there are a number of such ironwares, lying about”. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said, “Well, bring some ironwares.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The householder brought the ironwares. The great soul brought them in contact with the <span class="char-style-override-6">Pārasa</span> stone one by one and turned them into goldwares. Then the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“Now tell me whether it is an ordinary stone or the stone called <span class="char-style-override-6">Pārasa.”</span> The householder said—“Sire, it is undoubtedly the philosopher’s stone.” The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“If anyone supposes it to be an ordinary stone would you accept it?” “No, I won’t”—replied the householder. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“Now tell me if there is anyone in the world as rich as you are”. The householder said—“Surely there is none, sire.” The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“you can make thousands of men rich. You can make them even millionaire. Was this stone lying in your house or has it been brought in from somewhere?” The householder replied that it was not brought from outside it was lying in my own house. We were not aware of its worth and therefore we were grieving so far.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The same thing is applicable to the divine compassion like the stone in the householder’s house, God and His compassion are there already. But we do not recognize the divine compassion as such. And that is why we are tossing about. The householder wandered about for the sake of earning bread whereas we wander about in search of sensual pleasures for we fail to recognize the divine compassion that rains upon us. The divine compassion is there all the time whether one recognizes it or not. Through recognizing one knows it and through knowing one is transported to rapturous state leading to God-realization. At first we should imagine the boundless divine compassion is there and then if we recognize it as such we would take long strides towards the goal  and the goal stands achieved when our recognition leads to its true knowledge. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is a story that illustrates this, while some men were going from one village to another they were overtaken by heavy rains. The clouds were so thick that it was difficult for one to decipher one’s own hands. In the forest there was a rest house built by some rich man for people to stay at. To save themselves from the existing bad weather all of them took shelter in the rest house. The rest house consisted of a number of rooms. They seated themselves in different rooms but there was darkness. They shivered in the rooms for cold wind was blowing. All were shivering with cold but there was warmth in one of the rooms and the people who were there were not so much oppressed with cold. They wondered why it was warm there. The reason thereof was that some burning embers were lying in a corner of the room on which ash was settled. Being covered with the ash the embers were not noticeable to anyone. But the room was warm. Everyone tried to ascertain the cause of the warmth in the room. They wondered why that room alone was warm whereas all others were cold. There must be some reason behind this phenomenon. On making a search, fire covered with ash was found out and nearby lay many pieces of wood. Fuel was in abundance. People began to burn the fuel to light up the fire. As a result flames came out of the fire. People came in running. Someone said—“Dear brother, give me some embers please.” And when people asked what he would do with the fire he replied that he would cook food and would light the lamp to get light. Another gentleman came up and said—“Dear one, please give some embers to me also.” And when people asked what he would do with it he said that he was a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> who ritually offered oblations to the domestic fire and he performed <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> for the sake of a son so he needed some embers. People let him have them. Thereafter came up a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> who also demanded some embers for himself. When he was asked what he would do with the fire he said that he would offer oblations to fire-god for the sake of his redemption for the inner conscience of those who offer oblations in a selfless spirit to fire-god stand purified and God-realization is achieved. Then he too was given embers by the people and all of them began to perform their desired actions. Now the point worth considering is that even when there was no knowledge of the presence of fire the room was full of warmth. Admittedly this much was the advantage which people enjoyed even before the knowledge of the presence of fire in the room. The moment people got the knowledge of the presence of fire in the room they began to take more advantage of it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some regarded fire as god while some regarded it to be a material substance. Two types of powers are inherent in it—One of burning and the other of giving light. It is in analogy with the sun which too has the twin powers of burning and giving light. The moon, however, is endowed with only one power—the power of giving light. The burning power is not there for it is cool. The fire contains both the properties. Those who revered  it like a god attained spiritual welfare, those who cherished the desire for accomplishment attained accomplishment, those offering oblations in a motived way were blessed with son. Those <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇas </span>who wanted to be great souls, attained internal purity through performing A<span class="char-style-override-6">gnihotra</span> with a disinterested spirit. Similar approach can be made in respect of great souls, God and the Gaṅgā. People living in a place are indeed automatically benefited which is the abode of a great soul. It occurs in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata</span> that when king Yudhiṣ¢hira was staying at Virā¢anagara  it was Bhīṣma who declared in the assembly of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Kauravas</span> that the place where Yudhiṣ¢hira would be staying would never be affected by famine; the place would not be affected by epidemics and there would be no natural disasters. The people of the place where Yudhiṣ¢hira would be staying would have inclination for righteousness, they would be truthful and such a land would flourish in material welfare and righteousness as well. He predicted a lot of things, hearing these words the messengers said that all those things can be found in Virā¢anagara. This prompted Duryodhana to lay siege to Virā¢anagara. The thing worth noticing is what a great influence Yudhiṣ¢hira’s personality exercised. The land he lived in abounded with material prosperity and righteousness. Such a place was neither frequented by famine nor by epidemics. Though Yudhiṣ¢hira stayed in Virā¢anagara for a year but none attributed these auspiciousness to Yudhiṣ¢hira. Yet king Virā¢a as well as the inhabitants were benefited by Yudhiṣ¢hira’s presence there. |When the king Virā¢a came to know that those staying with him were none else but the <span class="char-style-override-6">PāṇÎavas</span> he took greater advantage of their presence. King Virā¢a proposed to marry his daughter Uttarā to Arjuna. But being the teacher of his daughter she was daughter to him and so he would not marry her but suggested that he could marry his daughter Uttarā to Abhimanyu. Similarly, the presence of a great soul is conducive to one’s goodness whether one knows the fact of his presence or does not know. It will be much beneficial if one knows the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> and recognizes him as such, merely recognizing him as such is of great benefit, through knowing him one develops reverence for him and his reverence is of great benefit to him even if it is with self-interest but if the reverence is unmotivated it is all the more beneficial to one. The same is applicable in case of devotion to God. One is benefited even if one adores the God without knowing His influence. We can take for example Ajāmila who had named his son Nārāyaṇa. At the time of death when the emissaries of Yama, (the god of death) came to escort him he twice called the name of his son—Nārāyaṇa. Ajāmila thought that he was calling out to his son. He was ignorant of the fact that his son’s name was the Divine Name and that through its mere articulation it is capable of redeeming all the sins and one is not compelled to enter the territory of Yama after the sins are redeemed. This was revealed to him when God’s emissaries arrived there. God’s emissaries drove away the emissaries of Yama and he was rescued. Then he went to Haradvāra and there he adored God which brought about his spiritual welfare. To sum up it can be said that adoration of God is beneficial even if it is carried on without knowing Him but if adoration is carried on knowing God as such it can be even more beneficial. Then if after knowing God one develops reverence for Him in that case greater benefit can be derived. Immeasurable will be the benefit if one reverences Him disinterestedly.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bearing in mind the things stated above uttering of the Divine Name should constantly be practised in a secret manner. The fact that the Divine Name is being repeated should not be revealed to anyone. The practice of <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa</span> should be carried on uninterruptedly. Let not the continuity break. Like śivajī the practice of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa </span>of the Divine Name and meditation on the divine aspect should be carried on without any interruption.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Innumerable are the Divine Names but that alone is the best of them all in which one has one’s faith, devotion and reverence. The Muslims can make a choice between Allāha and Khudā whereas the Hindus can make a choice among Oṁ, Rāma, Hari, Govinda, Vāsudeva and Nārāyaṇa etc., and should utter with reverence and devotion constantly practise the <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa</span> of that very name in which they have faith and reverence. If <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa</span> is carried on with a view to developing love of God or with a view to God-realization, it is as good a <span class="char-style-override-6">Japa</span> as one carried on disinterestedly. If it is carried on without a motive in good time one attains God-realization as a matter of course. So one should not cherish even the desire of God-realization in one’s heart. Such remembrance of God is invaluable. The divine aspect meditated upon should be as described below—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Supernatural is the beauty and elegance of the divine aspect. Such beauty and elegance is not to be found in the world. Even if that embodiment of beauty is compared with crores of Kāmadevas (Cupids) the comparison will not be a befitting one for he is matchless and par excellence. None is as excellent as He. Every comparison made, shall fail to describe Him. There is nothing in resemblance of Him with which He can be compared. He is so exceedingly graceful that if one even once gets a glimpse of His true aspect one should be transported into the state of complete self-forgetfulness, one should become oblivious of the world. One would forget the awareness of the world and even forget his own self. There would be no end to his ecstasy just as the bird called <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Cakora’</span> enamoured of the beauty of the full moon intently looks at it with unwinking eyes. The example of the bird called <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Cakora’</span> and the moon does not aptly describe Him for He is incomparable. After seeing with one’s eyes that inordinate beauty and charm and after having a glimpse of that lotus like face one should intend to drink in that ocean of beauty or to gaze and gaze at it with yearning eyes. One should look at it with such yearning eyes that one should become oblivious of himself—nothing but the consciousness of the divine aspect should remain existent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While meditating on God one should feel horripilation again and again and tears should roll from eyes, one should be amazed to think how a mean fellow like him is going to attain God-realization. One should feel boundless joy, enlightenment and peace while visualizing the divine aspect one should reflect on the divine plays (performed by manifest divinities). One should recall to one’s mind the characters of Lord Rāma and the character of Lord Kr̥ṣṇa or whichever deity is dear to one, whomsoever one regards as one’s favourite deity or for whom one has reverence in one’s heart. Seeing it again and again one should be overwhelmed or visualizing it mentally, should be totally absorbed in it. While mentally perceiving the divine plays one should concentrate one’s attention on the divine attributes.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One should recall to memory such attributes that ‘God is the supreme lover.’ He is inordinately compassionate and forgiving for infinite are the divine attributes. He is the ocean of such limitless attributes such as forgiveness, compassion, peace, contentment, simplicity, knowledge and dispassion etc. Our estimate and knowledge of Him is far behind its reality. Visualizing the divine attributes one should feel so enchanted as to reflect that God is so supremely compassionate as to be ready to bestow His love on me who am so mean and worthless. God is always ready to welcome us with open arms when the divine hands are over us, we do not lack anything at all why should we be worried? If one knows the secret of divine compassion and its truth then one should feel enchantment at every moment, feel joy all over and one should be endowed with such qualities as forbearance, serenity, courage and fearlessness. One should feel that one has taken refuge in God and taking shelter in Him one is seated in His very lap.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a boy after abusing and beating someone runs up to his mother and seeks shelter in her lap he finds himself well protected. But if the other boy approaches her and complains that her son had abused and beaten him the mother acts impartially, she enquires of her son if he had beaten him (the complainant). The son confesses the offence. Mother further asks her son why he had beaten him. The son replies that it was he who had struck him first, I simply retaliated. Then the mother lovingly asks the boy why he had beaten. He replies that he (the son) had abused him first, then she asks her son why he abused the boy. He gives no reply and remained silent and then the mother realizes that her own son was at fault. Then the mother slaps her son. Being slapped the son starts weeping. The boys who came to complain are pleased. They thought to themselves that it was good he was beaten and they had avenged on him. But the son under the veil of his mother’s saree though outwardly seemed to be weeping was happy at heart. He smiles for the mother’s beating was too mild. Had the boy retaliated he would be mortified. This is what is applicable in case of God as well.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God makes us suffer the evil consequence of our sins or in other words punishes us for our good for by making us suffer for our sins He sets us free from undergoing thousands of births we should otherwise be obliged to take in future. He grants us redemption. In the same way as the mother saved her son from being beaten by the boys who had turned up for the purpose, by giving two slaps to her own son. God thereby saves us from all sorts of sins that is from evil propensities, evil habits and evil conducts. Indulgence in sleep and negligence—all these pose severe consequences but He saves us from all of them only by putting a mild yoke on our shoulders, such as someone is diseased or falls sick, a boy dies or the house catches fire. No doubt this is punishment but it is quite mild. The creature attains spiritual welfare through this. God frees him from all sins. If all these unfavourable situations come up we should regard them as divine gifts which have been conferred on us through divine compassion. Whoever realises the truth of divine compassion remains smiling all the time. Whatever incidents may take place he looks upon it only as divine compassion. At first he has to believe that God is full of compassion for him and honour, praise and fame which appear nectarine are gradually disappearing. Those who are worried at this sight are fools; the sensible persons do not react like that. One should take it for granted that God is supremely compassionate to him. Remembering again and again with gratitude the divine compassion one should feel enchanted all the time. When Lord Rāmacandra returns from Lanka to Ayodhya, He assumes innumerable forms and meet everybody in an appropriate manner. Whomsoever He meets he feels amazed. He feels gratified with the idea that—“God had met me first of all. How lucky am I? What comparison between the Lord and me? How surprizing it is that the Lord of the three worlds comes to see first of all a humble person like me”. Such was their realization. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord śaṅkara says to goddess Umā—O Umā, just as the wire puller makes the wooden puppets dance at his will so also God makes everyone dance. He performs divine plays. If we regard that divine play as such, one easily crosses the ocean of existence. Every divine play, contains some divine dispensation. Every activity which is going on is divinely inspired. It is but folly if we do not recognize the divine compassion but if we believe that the divine compassion is there we may realize it later on. Then of course there would be no need of believing in it but in the beginning one has to believe and when the realization is there one feels boundless bliss. One feels the same forbearance, the same solemnity as well as the same fearlessness as arises in the heart of a child when he is seated in his mother’s lap.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What sort of fear haunts if one has sought lodgement in the lap of God. He becomes solemn as God himself is solemn. Let him have patience, let him develop love, let him have reverence for God. Then how he can think forsaking God and seeking shelter somewhere else. When one surrenders oneself to God, one easily crosses the sea of life and attains benediction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">No one would prefer to undergo the treatment of a physician who has no goodwill to his credit although he is intelligent, well read and is well-versed in Ayurvedic therapy. But people prefer to undergo the treatment of one who has acquired some experience through practice and treats his patients well although he may not be well qualified. Even if a little success is achieved it attracts the entire world. There was a boy in Anguli (Orisa) about whom there was a rumour that he had some herbal medicine and the patient whom he offers gets rid of his ailment. It was in fact a false rumour. Though there was no truth in it, it was just by chance that some people got well and a large crowd rushed to him. Thousands, nay lakhs of people approached him. High officials and rich men approached him for he had earned fame and was considered successful but had no knowledge of medical science. He was neither well-read nor a physician in the true sense. He offered a little medicine to some of the people and somehow they got well. The result was that His village-folk, city folk and other people rushed to him. Thousands of Indians nay lakhs of Indians approached there and began to entreating for the medicine saying—“Give me only a pinch of medicine.” There was a large gathering there. Unimaginable would be the state if the success were genuine. There is sure and real success in case of God. Same is the case with the high soul. One must take care that one should crave from God neither learning, nor intelligence, nor knowledge but should crave, only for real success. If God condescends to grant success there would be nothing but success on all sides. There would be no harm and no loss either.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A story is often heard. In Bikaner there was a man who belonged to the itinerant class of men. He used to sell Multānī soil. There were no railways in the olden days. He would load his goods on the back of bullocks and sell them in the market. Once loading the Multānī soil on the back of bullocks he set out for Delhi. As and when the Multānī soil was sold he would fill the empty space with sand. One wise man was going to Bikaner from Delhi. When He came across the itinerant man he asked him why he filled the empty place with sand. When the itinerant man asked him what he should do then he suggested that he should shift the entire load on the back of one of the bullocks and to let one of them be free from the load. He advised him not to torture the bull by overloading him. The itinerant man took the hint for he thought it to be an intelligent suggestion, such a suggestion was not given by anyone else. The itinerant man said—“Well, you deserve thanks. Wherefrom are you coming? He replied that he was coming from Delhi. The itinerant man enquired what sort of business he carried on in Delhi. He replied that he had a large scale business in Delhi. The itinerant man further asked how much money he had earned. He replied—“I did earn ten thousand rupees but I had to suffer loss, the money was all spent. Moreover I had to borrow money from the people of my village which is a burden on my head. My hopes are shattered and hiding my face from others I am fleeing away for my life.” He said—“Friend, no doubt you earned thousands of rupees but did not exercise your wits, your wits do not seem to be fruitful. Keep your wits to yourself. Had you been wise enough you would not become pauper, turn your back upon them. He gradually advanced and reached Delhi and unloaded the sand and the remaining Multānī soil at the house of a businessman. The entire Multānī soil was sold away in Delhi but the heap of sand stood there undisturbed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king of that place had fallen victim to a strange disease and the physician prescribed that he would get much relief if the sand of Rajaputana side was sent for, the king politely asked him where it could be found? The physician replied that it would be available far away and it would require three days to fetch it from there—a day would be spent in reaching there, another day in making arrangement and the third day for the return journey. A man informed the king that there was a heap of sand at the house of a certain businessman. The king said that if the sand was available there, there was no need to send for it from Bikaner and ordered his men to go and purchase it. The man approached the businessman and asked wherefrom he had brought the sand and the Multānī soil. He replied that the sand was brought all the way from Rajaputana and he would sell it at the same rate at which he had sold the Multānī soil. You can purchase as much quantity as you desire. Thus the sand was sold at the same rate at which the Multānī soil was sold. Then the group of the itinerant men spoke to him that if he had acted upon the advice of the man (he had met on the way) he would have been deprived of the profit. To sum up it can be said that one should not act upon the advice of a man whose wits fail to help one achieve one’s objectives in spite of the fact that such man is very intelligent and learned. If you apply your wits you shall be a loser. Take heed not to apply your wits. One should act upon the injunctions of the Lord, what is prescribed by the scriptures and what is advised by the great souls. Thus the benefit will be quite evident, but the moment we apply our wits there is gloom all-round. A story is being narrated here as an example. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a theist as well as an atheist. Both were sitting under a mango tree laden with many fruits. The theist said—“God never errs, He is ever far from erring. All His activities and His dispensations are all conducive to well-being of all. Of course there may be some delay but there is no injustice.” The atheist says—I want to say something. The theist nodded. Then the atheist said—God makes this tall and thick tree yield small fruit whereas He makes small plants yield large fruit. For example when the pumpkin becomes ripe it yields fruit weighing five or ten seers whereas He makes this big tree yield small fruit weighing fifty to two hundred grams each. It shows that God lacks intelligence. Meanwhile a mango fell from the tree and hit his head. The mango was a ripe one. The falling mango hit his head hard. The atheist pronounced the word ‘Rāma’ repeatedly to express his amazement. Now the theist ejaculated—Just imagine what would have been your condition if the fallen fruit weighed ten seers. It must have broken your skull. Well, God is not prone to commit errors. It is only foolishness to conceive of error in His activities.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">I want to reiterate one thing about the divine compassion. The divine compassion is thousand and million times greater than what we suppose it to be upon us. If you take this thing for granted you will enjoy such bliss and peace that you will become oblivious of yourselves and the world and will be lost in the remembrance of God and God alone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">You ought to have faith in God. You ought to have reverence in Him. Bear this thing in your mind and He will reveal Himself to you—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सोइ  जानइ  जेहि देहु जनाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जानत तुम्हहिं तुम्हइ होइ जाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">God reveals Himself to those who desire to know Him. And those who know Him in essence become Godlike. He can make one the resemblance of him. He lacks nothing. Nothing is impossible for him to do.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">To Whom You Associate, You become the Like of Him</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We often listen to very useful talks. The religious meetings are frequented by good speakers who invariably throw light on the subtle and secret matters and deal with subjects relating to knowledge, devotion, dispassion and good conduct. We should make deliberation why even after listening to these talks we remain uninfluenced and unchanged. Needless it is to say anything about the speakers, and needless it is to find fault with the listeners. The listeners are also good and the speakers are also good. Certainly everyone is free to express his inability and declare that he is neither competent nor worthy but he cannot do so in respect of others. Be he the speaker or listener he can of course, say such things for his own self. I am reminded of a story bearing on this subject. The tales do contain moral instructions but the stories do convey some moral lessons. Scriptural events are stories and folk lore are tales. The tale goes as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Once there was a king. A learned <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> visited him. He daily related to the king some stories. That way a number of years passed. One day the king said to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span>—“Sire, a number of years have elapsed since you started relating such stories. Today you related me a story, similar ones you daily relate to me. Resorting to this practice both of us have grown up old. But even today I am what I used to be many years ago. Three to four thousand rupees are spent for this purpose every year. This adversely affects the government treasury. Should this expenditure go waste or it should be of some benefit to me. Both of us waste our time besides the money that is spent for the purpose. Tell me why no spiritual elevation is there? I listen to what you say. You talk of dispassion, devotion, and knowledge but in spite of listening to you I neither became a devotee nor  an enlightened one, nor virtuous, nor a <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span>. Answer decisively within a month. If you fail to give the answer the recitation of <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Kathā’</span> will come to a close and the payment of your wages will be stopped, you will have to find out some other means to earning your livelihood. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> was stunned to hear this. The learned <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> began to reflect what reply he should give to the king. When the learned <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> was lost in anxious thoughts he met on the way a <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>—a great soul in the true sense. He practised dispassion and self-denial and had sense of renunciation at heart. He was indeed a great man of a very high order. Seeing the sadness on the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa’s</span> face he asked the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> what the matter with him was. The learned <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> said—“The fact is that I am going to lose my livelihood after a month. When the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> enquired the reason thereof he told him that he could not answer the question asked by the king. The question is “Why is it so that no trace of dispassion, knowledge and devotion is visible in him in spite of the fact that I preach to him daily on matters of knowledge, devotion and dispassion and he listens to me.” He has warned to stop the expenditure incurred by him in this respect in case I fail to answer his question satisfactorily. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“Why are you worried about it? I shall answer the question asked.” The learned <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> said—“I shall be rather loser if you answer the question. I mean it will be humiliating for me in the sense that I myself could not answer the question; it is answered by this sage. (They would say). The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“No, it won’t be humiliating for you. You should inform the king that it was an ordinary matter and even my disciples could answer the question and I shall become one. Since I shall appear as your disciple and answer the question it will not be against your interest, I suppose. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> accepted that such arrangement will not be prejudicial to his interest. The learned <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> approached the king the next day. The king then asked—Sire, are you ready to answer the question? The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> said—“Your Majesty, it is but an ordinary matter, I have a number of disciples and any one can answer the question. The king said—“I want the answer, it matters little whether you answer the question or your disciple. You can bring your disciple tomorrow, if you please.” The next day the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> approached the king with the sage and the sage following the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> like a disciple. The king asked him if he (the sage) was his disciple. He replied politely in the affirmative. The king enquired if he knew what his question was the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said—“Yes, I know it. Your question is why is it that although about thirty years have passed in listening to the discourses on the subjects of knowledge, dispassion and devotion, still it had no effect on you? The king said—“That’s it”. The disciple said—I can answer your question provided you hand over to me the entire power and authority for an hour and    instruct them to carry out my orders. Just after ascending the throne he ordered that the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> should be tied up with strings. He further ordered that the king too should be tied with strings. In compliance with the order the king was also tied. Both were at a loss to know what was being done to them. Then the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> that he had been telling the king legendary stories for a very long time and on its basis he should request the king to get the strings unfastened. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa </span>requested the king to get his strings unfastened but the king expressed his inability to do so. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa </span>said that in such a state he himself should do the job. The king said that as he himself was tied he could not unfasten him. Then he requested the king to get the work done through some other means but the king replied that he could not get him unfastened  for his order carried no weight and added that his orders are not carried out nor his hands were free to do the job. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said to the king that you have listened to the discourses from the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> for so many years, you request the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> to unfasten  you. <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> replied that he himself was bound. How can he unfasten him? Now the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> asks the king whether his question has been answered or not. The king replied that he did not follow him. He further asked—“Don’t you follow me, even now? How can one who is himself tied make others free? If you can’t break your own bondage how can you set others free?” The king said—“I do understand you now.” Then he asked the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> if he could follow what he had stated and whether he could make others free, when he himself was tied. And when he replied that he could not do so. <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> said to the king your Majesty, this <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa </span>certainly narrates to you, gives you discourses everyday, but he himself is under bondage. Though he himself is enmeshed in worldly coils and you expect him to set you free from bondage. Had the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> himself attained deliverance he could help you attain deliverance. One cannot attain deliverance only through narrating mythological stories. The parrots and the Mainās go on repeating ‘Rādhe Kr̥ṣṇa’. They do not understand why they repeat ‘Rādhe Kr̥ṣṇa’. When the cat comes up and tries to catch them instead of saying ‘Rādhe Kr̥ṣṇa’, as usual they talk like birds. The same is the case with the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span>. How can then the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> help you attain deliverance. A person who himself has lost attachment with the world can bring about a change in others and those who are attached to the world and crave for comforts, luxuries and enjoyments can never be able to bring about deliverance for others. Only such a person can do so who has developed keen dispassion from the world—a person of exalted soul who has developed not only dispassion but also unconcernedness and is possessed of the knowledge of the Supreme Being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who has freed himself from worldly bondages can of course, make others free. Some speakers suppose that they are supremely good and are free from all evils. They suppose that the hearers lack reverence, love, intelligence and ability and it is on account of this lack that they fail to get advantage. They feel that the hearers are lacking not they (the speakers). How strange it is because of this lack that they come to listen to them with eager heart? Taking that for granted it becomes imperative on the part of the speakers that they should set them right, not make excuses that is giving explanations to prove that they are quite innocent and the entire fault lies with the listeners. The listeners, on the other hand, plead that if they had not possessed faults why they should have come to listen to them. It is only for eradication of faults that they assemble. A speaker should regard it as his duty to eliminate the evils of his listeners for the listeners are supposedly ignorant. If the speaker is learned in the true sense the burden only lies on his shoulders, and not on the ignorant. They throw away their responsibility by saying that they are unwise and ignorant, they are indeed unworthy and they have come there and it lies with them to make them worthy. If you are incapable of creating worthiness in others why should you regard yourself as a preacher, educator and teacher? It is hard to say anything about others in this respect but as far as I am concerned I can definitely say that it does not lie within my power to make everyone worthy and dispel the darkness overshadowing them, to eliminate their sense of attachment and malice or make them worthy through exhorting them, instructing them and  delivering speeches. Hence neither I have the ability to sermonize or instruct nor have a prerogative to do so. So we declare that neither we have the capability nor worthiness nor even the deservedness neither on the score of caste nor stage in life nor state in society nor my capability. I declare I am unworthy for the job, I convey to you through my lips only what the scriptures say. I do believe that in our lives by acting upon them, we can spiritually attain and can get redemption. What is written in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> is Divine oration, surely these are not concocted talks. What is written in the <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstras</span> is the assertion of the <span class="char-style-override-6">¤Rṣis</span>. If we act upon the injunctions of the Lord and the ¤<span class="char-style-override-6">Rṣis</span>we can advance spiritually by bringing about improvement in us, attain redemption as well as some power inheres in a certain object and it is so dynamically effectual that it brings about an automatic improvement in everyone. It also depends to some extent on the reverence of the listeners. The listeners can be benefited through their reverence. It is not upto us (speakers) to do so. The credit goes to the listeners. I do not possess any greatness, miraculous power or capability so as to bring about an awakening in you by exerting my power or some other influence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Simple hearted are our womenfolk and so are our male people. Clever men such as we are, deceive them. Some cheat your money while some even attack your chastity; some as householders others as <span class="char-style-override-6">Sādhus</span> and still others introducing themselves as <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogīs,</span> devotees or sages deceive the innocent public especially our mothers and sisters. Under such state of affairs, our womenfolk, sisters as well as our male people should be very careful. These days there is a flow of speakers. They are slaves to wealth and woman and many of them are slave to honour, praise and prestige. Some declare themselves as <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Gurus’</span> and some not only proclaim themselves <span class="char-style-override-6">Gurus</span> but go to the extent of declaring themselves as <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhagavān</span> Himself. Thus some introduce themselves as God while others introduce themselves as supreme <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogīs</span> or sages. We know that there is something black at the bottom with these sober looking persons but we do not point it out for it is not rightful for us to do so. It does not behove us to find fault with others. We do know the fact but knowingly we do not point it out. Such is the state of affairs prevailing in the world at present. We should bear in mind that out of hundred of speakers hardly one turns out great man in the true sense but among the common people we find one out of lakhs and tens of millions of people. We have no right to say in respect of others that a certain person declares himself as <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> but he is not so; a certain  person poses to be a <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> but he is not so; a certain man assumes to be a realised soul but he is not such. We have not the right to say so in respect of others. But as regards my own self I must declare that I am incapable. If others suppose so in respect of me, they may get deceived. I declare that I am an ordinary man, I am neither a capable nor a qualified person to deserve such veneration. I simply explain in my own humble way what the great souls have stated and man can attain beatitude only through acting upon their advice. The motive force lies in what they have said not in me. I can but affirm that whatever is contained in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> has emanated from the lips of Lord Kr̥ṣṇa. In the <span class="char-style-override-6">Rāmāyaṇa</span> we come across the expressions of Tulasīdāsajī, in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata</span> we come across the expressions of Vedavyāsajī. There is no doubt in attaining redemption through following the advice of Vedavyāsajī, Tulasīdāsajī and Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. But if someone ignorantly supposes my physical frame as <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span> or imagine it to be a good devotee and starts serving and adoring it. Thus I become indebted to them but I cannot guarantee that they will attain blessedness for I do not think that they will attain beatitude through serving me. I rather believe they are under deception for I am an ordinary man, a common man.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Someone asked me as to who were the great souls. In this regard the fact is that if one can have reverence for a man suggested by me, then one should rather have reverence for me. If on my suggestion you are prepared to regard someone as <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā,</span> enlightened one or a <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī </span>that means that you are giving much weightage to my words—that is the point worth considering. The thing is that in this world whom we should regard as <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā </span>or enlightened one or a devotee; how should we get benefited? The first and the foremost thing is that of all the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmās</span> God is the supreme one and one should take refuge in Him. He can appear before us in manifest form or we may come across Him in the form of a <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>. Firstly God is the supreme Lord and the supreme <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>—He is the Supreme Being. Secondly <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhagavadgītā</span>—the divine song is itself the Supreme <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahātmā</span>. Just as the Sikhs regard <span class="char-style-override-6">Grantha Sāhaba</span> written by Nānaka Sāhaba as equal to God and regarding <span class="char-style-override-6">Grantha Sāhaba</span> as <span class="char-style-override-6">Guru</span> follow its mandates so also the <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhagavadgītā</span> is the book of the highest order. In my knowledge and belief it stands out uncomparable in the field of spiritual knowledge. I am not omniscient nor do I claim to have read all the <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstras,</span> but of all the <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstras</span> I have gone through I found the <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhagavadgītā</span> to be the best. There are a number of other good books such as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāgavata</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Rāmāyaṇa</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Mahābhārata</span>—all of them are good indeed. We can be greatly benefited by books, keeping this thing in view we try to publicise them. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—“O Arjuna, whosoever preaches in the world this dialogue  between Me and you i.e., the most profound gospel of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> there is none dearer to Me than he nor shall anyone be dearer to Me, on the entire globe than he.” Such was the declaration of the Lord. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā </span>has highly been glorified in verses 68 and 69 of the XVIII chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>. The Lord proclaims—“Whosoever teaches the profound gospel of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> among my devotees shall come to Me on the merit of his supreme devotion.” He goes on to proclaim—There is none who does Me more loving service than he nor shall anyone be dearer to Me on the entire globe than he. When I read this proclamation I developed a reverence and a faith in my mind that when the Lord Himself gives such a guarantee the matter ought to be pondered over with due attention. This is something transcendental, sublime and unrevealed secret. So far we have been dealing with subjects relating to the divinity, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstras</span>. He is verily the great soul whose association fills our mind with extreme dispassion. He whose association, whose vision, speech, touch and reflection  on whom, gives rise to dispassion should be supposed to be a man absolutely free from attachment. Just as when we sit in the sun-shine we feel great heat and then we realize how tremendously hot the sun is; only after sitting in the sun for five minutes we feel extremely hot from head to foot—the moment we reflect on the source of the heat we come to realize heat has come from the sun-god; when we sit near fire we feel comparatively less hot and when at Kedāranātha we tread the ice we become cold from head to foot the natural effect of the ice. So also if the <span class="char-style-override-6">DarÜana,</span> touch, speech, conversation and recollection makes one feel that the marks of a person who has transcended the modes of Nature and those of enlightened great souls as described in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>, are appearing in oneself, one should consider him to be a perfect soul. Those men whose association, sight, touch and speech displays the emergence of such a character as has been described from verses thirteenth till the end of the XII chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> as the marks of Lord’s devotees, should be regarded  as Lord’s devotees. This is the unfailing touchstone on which they can be tested. Those whose sight creates in our body, mind and intellect marks of divine disposition as have been described in the first three verses of chapter XVI of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>, should be regarded as men endowed with divine properties. Besides those men whose association, sight, speech and conversation give rise to demoniac properties in us i.e., lust, anger, infatuation,  egotism, attachment and envy, one should suppose that in spite of assuming human form apparently, they are in fact the embodiment of demons, otherwise why after all are we assuming this demoniac disposition? We are being affected by none else but them. Similarly if the sight, speech and conversation with someone helps develop the science of <span class="char-style-override-6">Yoga</span> in someone, one must suppose him to be a <span class="char-style-override-6">Yogī</span> in the true sense for the saying goes—Our companionship hues our character so one should adjudge others by the effect they exercise on us. This sort of test is unerring and the most reliable one. This verily reminds me of a story relating to the state of Bikaner in Rajasthan which runs thus—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a king in the state of Bikaner. When he was enthroned he called for all the elderly persons and all his kith and kin to his presence and said—“Sires, I want to ask you one thing. You should unhesitatingly answer my question in right way.” Though younger in age being the ruler of the state he is addressed in a respectful manner. Therefore people said “please ask us. “The king enquired thus—All of you are elderly persons, as you have witnessed the administration of at least three generations of rulers. You have also been witnessing my administration for the last ten years or so, previously my father was the ruler and prior to that you had witnessed the administration of my grandfather also. Of all the three whose administration do you think was excellent? Is it that of mine or of my father or my grandfather?” One of the elderly men replied—O king, you are indeed great man. We have no authority to give our verdict in this matter. It is beyond us to make assessment either of you or your father or grandfather. Of course, we can express our own impression and you can make your own estimate on its basis.” He added—I was only twenty years old when the reigns of administration were in the hands of your grandfather. And once when I was coming down a sandy cliff I heard a woman weep. I went up to her. She was a woman of <span class="char-style-override-6">VaiÜya</span> caste. She was loaded with ornaments valuing about ten thousand rupees. She was in tears and when I asked her the cause of weeping she told me that she was going for the first time from her mother’s place to her father-in-law’s house. She was in a bullock cart and goods worth thousands of rupees were loaded on the back of camels. She had a number of guards with her but suddenly a band of robbers comprising twenty of them came up and attacked them. All men on our side fled away and I too fled away but they plundered all the articles. She has come on this cliff for the safety of her life. When I asked her where her mother’s and father-in-law’s places were she told me the addresses. I was familiar with some of the men of her father-in-law’s house, so I lovingly consoled her and advised her not to worry. Regarding her as my own sister I escorted her to her father-in-law’s place. The members of that family were already making a search for her. They knew that the robbers had made good their escape after plundering the money but they did not know the whereabouts of the bride. When I approached them I told them that she was weeping on the cliff. On reaching home she burst into tears and narrated to father-in-law, mother-in-law and her husband her sad plight. All the valuable possessions were robbed and she had somehow escaped into the forest for her life. She told them that it was I who had protected her and brought her there and she had no words to praise him adequately. She requested them to gratify me before sending me off. At her instance the members of her father-in-law’s family proposed to offer me one thousand rupees for I had not only saved the life of their daughter-in-law but also saved their money. I pleaded that I did not render her service for the sake of reward rather I did so considering it to be my duty. I reflected that she being a human being, it was my duty to do so, my motive wasn’t to get a reward. They tried their best and insisted on my accepting at least five hundred or so. But I refused to accept even a penny. They were rendered helpless. Since I was adamant they could not persuade me to accept money. Thereafter I returned home. So long as your grandfather remained alive, I sustained such an attitude, when your grandfather passed away I was about fifty years of age. Then it occurred to me that it was a golden opportunity for me when I had come across that woman, I could easily have stripped her of all her ornaments valuing ten thousand rupees in the forest and I could have escaped. Those ten thousand would have doubled by now at the rate of eight annas as interest. Thus I could have gathered a lot of money. I was a loser on account of holding the flag of duty high. Of what use is the fulfilment of duty to me now. He thought If he had taken away the ornaments he would have become quite wealthy in that case. On deep reflection such thoughts though seemed to be wicked but due to attachment for money he began to analyse that he was in the wrong. Had he brought the money home he would have enjoyed the life and then addressing the present king he said that when his Majesty sat on the throne I was seventy and now he was approximately seventy five to eighty years old and his wife had died and now he felt regrets for what he had done. Had he brought the woman home he would have her as his wife in the old age and he would have remained affluent. He would have swallowed and digested the ornaments worth ten thousand rupees and he would have persuaded her to become his wife and would have enjoyed life. She would render her services to me and would make merriments and now when death is fast approaching me, this is the state of my mind. Such is the state in old age. His mind has undergone such changes during their regimes. He is incapable of deciding whose administration is better and of whose is inferior. I have narrated you the state of mind I am in, during your regime and also narrated the state of mind I was in, during the regimes of your father and grandfather. Now it is upto you to decide whose reign was good and whose was not so.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">What we mean to say is that one’s companionship leaves its indelible impression on everyone. The man who deals in coal must blacken his hands. If we enter in a coal mine our dress must be spoilt. I have come across a number of instances where this saying holds quite good. It is our well-tried experience that companionship inevitably leaves its impression. The influence which others exercise on us is the touchstone on which we can test others. The device advised by me is so infallible that one need not consult others for the purpose. <span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">The Glory of Truth</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There was a king who was truthful and pious. In his kingdom if someone brought for sale such articles as grains, cloths etc., and the commodity remained unsold till the evening the king used to purchase that commodity. This truthful avowal of the king was motivated for the sake of common good. So as soon as it was evening the king’s attendants would go round the city and if they found anyone sitting with his commodities unsold, they would purchase the commodity after consulting the seller and paying him the price to his satisfaction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day it so happened that Dharmarāja himself disguised as a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> came to the capital of the truthful and pious king with a wooden box filled with broken and useless things which were worth being thrown away and sat down in the market with a view to sell them. But who would purchase the rubbish? When darkness set in, the servants of the king began to take round of the city as usual. The commodities which were brought to the city for sale were all sold away. Only that <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> was there with his wooden box full. The king’s employees approached him and asked if his commodities could not be sold. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> replied that they could not be sold. The king’s employees further asked what commodity he had brought in the wooden box for sale and what price he demanded for it. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> replied that it was full of rubbish (the synonym of poverty) and that he demanded one thousand rupees for it. Hearing this the king’s servants laughed and said—“Who would purchase this rubbish which is worth nothing. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> said that if none would purchase it he would take it back to his house. The king’s servants rushed to the king and reported the matter to the king. The king said—“Let him not take back the commodity. Do purchase the commodity at the lowest possible price which may, of course, be acceptable to him.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The king’s men went to the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> and bade two hundred rupees as the price of the package but the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa </span>did not agree to accept anything less than one thousand. The king’s men offered to pay rupees five hundred but the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> refused to accept that much. Then some of the king’s men being irritated approached the king and said—“Your majesty, there is only rubbish in his package, it is worth nothing and he is not ready to sell it even for five hundred rupees. Under the circumstances it would be proper not to purchase his commodity.” The king said—“No, it is my truthful avowal. At no cost shall I give up the truth. So give the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa,</span> whatever he demands and purchase the commodity.” Hearing this the king’s men smiled at the king’s insistence and came back helplessly, they offered the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> one thousand rupees and took the package from him. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> left the place with the money and the king’s men brought the package to the king. The king got the box full of rubbish kept in the palace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At night when it was the time to go to bed an exceedingly beautiful woman adorned with beautiful garments and ornaments came out of the palace. Seeing the woman the king asked her who she was, why she had come and why she was leaving. The woman replied—“I am Lakṣmī, the goddess of prosperity. I have been residing all the time with you for you are a truthful and righteous king. But now since extreme poverty has found lodgement into your house and since Lakṣmī does not co-exist with extreme poverty, I am this day leaving your house forever. The king said—“As you please.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After a while when the king noticed a very good looking youth coming out of the palace gate he asked him who he was, why he had come there and whither he was going then. The handsome person replied—“My name is <span class="char-style-override-6">Dāna</span> (charity), I have been residing here with you all the time for you are truthful and righteous. Now I am going to the same place where Lakṣmī (prosperity) has gone for. Since Lakṣmī has departed you won’t be able to bestow charities.” “Very well,” said the king then.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thereafter another handsome person was seen coming out. The king asked him also who he was, why he had come and where he was intending to go. The man replied—“I am <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span>, I have been residing here all the time for you are truthful and righteous. But now since prosperity and charity have bidden good bye to this place, I too am departing for that place for without prosperity you won’t be able to perform <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span>. The king said—Very well.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then once again a young man appeared. The king asked him who he was, why he had come and where he was going. He said—“My name is <span class="char-style-override-6">YaÜa</span> (fame), I have been residing here with you all the time for you are truthful and righteous. But since prosperity, charity and <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span>—all have departed from your palace how can <span class="char-style-override-6">YaÜa</span> (fame) stay here? So I too am departing for the same place where all of them have gone. ‘That is right’, said the king.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then came out another good looking man. Seeing him the king put him the same question—“Who are you, why did you come here and where are you going? He replied—“My name is <span class="char-style-override-6">Satya</span> (truth), I have been staying hitherto with you for you are truthful and righteous but now since prosperity, charity, <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> and fame—all have departed from you, I too am going there.’ The king said—“It was for your sake that I gave up all of them. I never forsook you, so I won’t let you depart. It was for the sake of common good that I have taken a vow that I would purchase the commodity brought to my city for sale by someone and if that commodity remained unsold till the evening. Today came a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> to sell rubbish which was worth nothing but for the sake of my truthful vow that I purchased the rubbish from the seller <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa </span>after paying him a thousand rupees. Then Lakṣmī (prosperity) came to me and said that since dire poverty is lodged in my house she won’t stay here. That was why prosperity and others have departed from my house. Still I remain unshaken through your support.” Hearing this the truth said—“Since you have given up all of them for my sake I won’t depart from here. Saying this he again entered the palace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Only after a short while <span class="char-style-override-6">YaÜa</span> (fame) returned to the king. The  king asked—who he was and why he came there. He said—“I am none else but Fame. However charitable, wealthy and great performer of <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛas</span> one may be, one cannot earn real fame without being truthful. So I shall abide at the place where truth abides.” ‘Very well’, said the king. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then returned <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span>. The king asked him who he was and what for he had come there. He replied—“I am the self-same <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa,</span> I abide at the same place where truth abides. However charitable and wealthy one may be, <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> does not fulfil its purpose without truth. Since you have truthfulness with you, I shall stay at this very place.” The king said—“Very well.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then came back <span class="char-style-override-6">Dāna</span> (charitability). The king put the same question to him also—“Who are you and why have you come here?” “I am none else but <span class="char-style-override-6">‘Dāna’</span> you have truthfulness in you and I abide at the same place where truth abides for howsoever wealthy one may be one cannot become charitable without good-will. Since truth abides here I too shall abide at this place, replied he. The king said—“Very well.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After that came back Lakṣmī (prosperity). The king asked who she was and why she had come there. She said—“I am that very Lakṣmī. Truth abides here with you. Fame, <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Dāna </span>have come back to your palace and so have I. The king said—“O goddess, my house is filled with rubbish, how can you afford to live here? Lakṣmī said—“O king, after all I cannot afford to live  without truth? The king said—“As you please.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thereafter came Dharmarāja in the guise of the <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span>. The king asked who he was and for what purpose he had come there. Dharmarāja said—“I am the embodiment of <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span>. It was I who disguised as a <span class="char-style-override-6">Brāhmaṇa</span> gave you rubbish for one thousand rupees. By dint of truthfulness you have conquered  me who am <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span>. I have come to bless you. Tell me which of your objectives should I fulfil.” The king said—“Through your grace I do not stand in need of anything. Only let me enjoy your grace as ever.” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All desirable things abound in the place where Truth abides. One should not feel harrassed even if wealth, charitability, <span class="char-style-override-6">YajÛa</span> and fame are not present in the desired measure. If truth abides all these things will come back of their own accord unsolicited and in case they do not come back one is sure to attain beatitude. So a person desirous of attaining beatitude should in no case give up truth rather he ought to practise it firmly in life in a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Truth consists in truthfulness of speech and cultivation of virtues and good conduct. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सद्भावे साधुभावे च सदित्येतत्प्रयुज्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रशस्ते कर्मणि तथा सच्छब्द: पार्थ युज्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">यज्ञे तपसि दाने च स्थिति: सदिति चोच्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कर्म चैव तदर्थीयं सदित्येवाभिधीयते॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> XVII. 26-27)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The name of God ‘Sat’ is employed, O Pārtha, as an epithet of God for devoting His existence and of good sentiment as well as in the sense of praiseworthy acts. It is likewise employed in the sense of steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and charity and action for the sake of God is verily termed as ‘Sat.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Given below are the oft quoted lines of a poet—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">What a lofty idea in these verses uttered by Lord Kr̥ṣṇa!  Fix thy mind on Me,  worship Me alone, pay  obeisance to Me, be devoted to Me. By doing so you will come to Me. Give up dependence on all <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharmas,</span> take shelter in Me alone, I will free you from all sins. Grieve not.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Can there be a better and higher thing? <span class="char-style-override-6">śāstras</span> are endlessly voluminous. It is not so that Arjuna was the only best devotee. There have been greater devotees than him. The Lord in <span class="char-style-override-6">Bhāgavata</span> Himself says—<span class="char-style-override-9">‘ता मन्मनस्का मत्प्राणा:’</span><span class="char-style-override-8"> </span>(X. 46. 4). Nobody else knows the truth in reality as the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> know. The Lord  said to Arjuna—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘मन्मना भव’ ़ </span>But the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> were already so. If somebody advises a habitually early-riser to leave the bed before sunrise, the early-riser  will  laugh at him as he is unaware of the fact. So, the Lord cannot instruct <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> to fix their mind on Him. The <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> ranked much higher to Arjuna. One need not say to a man having strong faith—“I assure you, I promise you and so on.” The Lord said to Arjuna—<span class="char-style-override-9">‘मा शुच:’</span><span class="char-style-override-8">; </span>grieve not. I will free you from all sins. Ifhe were aware of the nature of the Lord there would have been no grief. The devotees of higher orders do not desire to be pardoned from the sins. They do not say even this much—you are very kind and merciful; you do not look to the faults of your servants. Such devotees feel satisfied only through undergoing the results thereof. So far as Arjuna is concerned, he did accept the pardon. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-6">Gītā</span> contains for us a teaching of very high order. We are no match to Arjuna. We desire salvation also as well as freedom from worries. But the devotees of high order do not address to the Lord as kind and forgiving. Why should they call him Dīnabandhu? Let them, who want something from Him, say so. Only the flatterers flatter him as kind. I do not say so nor do I seek his mercy. You are the protector of suffering, orphans and poors. Shower your mercy upon them. If a man of lacs is presented with a meagre amount of two rupees he will say—give it to some poor. Where there is a high grade love; where all sentiments reach a consummation point there can remain no distinction of big and small. Neither there can be a sentiment of servitude nor the parental affection nor even the conjugal relation. There can remain neither a bridal relation nor that of a paramour. Then how can there be conjugal sentiment? “The Lord is groom and I am his bride” this idea is also not there nor is there a relation of friendship. it is an indescribablestate. There is nothing like dual. They only appear two but actually not so. They are only one. For example there are two arms. When joined they become one. Who is bigger or smaller out of them? It is a matter of pondering whether they are two or one. Appearing two they are one and being one they appear as two. In <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedānta</span> (the identity of the devotee is merged in the Lord thus) they are physically one but here being one they appear two and being two they are one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Unlike Vedāntic identity there is unique type of oneness in the high order of love. It is always the selfsame divine love—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"><span class="char-style-override-10">(</span><span class="char-style-override-13">Gītā</span><span class="char-style-override-10"> VI. 31)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">They dwell in Him (God) that  is duality and through intense love inwardly they are one and that is unity . Thus both things are there. Adoration in the state of being established in oneness is a unique worship. There no Lord is addressed as there is oneness. Love, lover and beloved—all the three are one. There both are lovers and both are beloveds. In the eyes of one, one is lover and the other is beloved. It is the limit of non-differentiation. The things like <span class="char-style-override-6">Guṇa</span> and <span class="char-style-override-6">Swarµupa</span> are left far behind. Just as a ministerial staff of a king is left outside of the gate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> have conjugal sentiment towards the Lord but so far as the high order of love is concerned, the <span class="char-style-override-6">Gopīs</span> stand just like watch dogs. There the factors like glory and merit do not count at all. Where love depends upon the glory there the Lord is overshadowed by his glory and is substituted by his influence. If one loves on the ground of merit it is still lower than the love of a chaste woman. (The real lover) does not love because the other party is meritorious. Whatever and howsoever be the beloved, our job is only to love. In reference of the perfect love, it is like the two arms loving each other—the love not based on any merit. The same way there is no difference between the Lord and the devotee. There is no especiality in Lord as the three become one. The Lord, devotion and devotee all the three become one. Such a state is spontaneous. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So much has been said but it is all slightly better than nothing. As a matter of truth what is there to be said is just like an ocean. What mind thinks is like a drop and what is narrated by speech is just like only an atom. Even if one goes on narrating and  narrating throughout his life it could not amount to a droplet even.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is really required is to spend the life while talking of the Lord. Neither vision of the Lord is necessary nor anything else. The life must pass on this very line. One should not entertain a desire to meet Him or get salvation or favourable circumstances. Although it is good but the means should be accountedas better and higher than the meeting with Him. The stage of perfection will come of its own accord. But fixing it as the goal and practising discipline therefore, cause delay. Even if this idea is not there it will be still higher a thing. Even avoiding this if one tries to appreciate and understand in reality the perfection will be quick. If no desire is entertained to attain God and the journey on the road of love continues then the attainment of the Lord will be quicker. If riddance from this desire (of attaining God quicker) also is got rid of, it is still better.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If our spiritual discussion reaches a high pitch, God will not leave the  place even if pushed away. Beware, it may not be felt necessary to enact a law to forbid the Lord to visit the place on that occasion while the discussion is going on and allow him to enter only when the topic is over. The Lord somehow feels shy there and the devotee gets an upper hand. It is the real means of winning over the Lord. The Lord and the devotee these are the humanly words. There in realm of love both are Lord and devotees both in the eyes of each other. It is a strange thing, and an effort before the communion. For example about the meeting of Rāma and Bharata, Tulasīdāsa says—“It cannot be narrated through the speech! Rāma and Bharata meet but it is not such a meeting. God meets God. How wonderful is such a meeting! The activities of the devotee create ecstatic joy more and more in the heart of the Lord. So does the Lord attempt to increase the joy of the devotee. The communion of the two is entirely different and unearthly as compared to the embracing by the stretched arms. At that time all the limbs become personified Love. The embodied beings, body and the bodily efforts all become charged with Love; become one. To describe that meeting through speech is impossible.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Every limb of the body and all efforts are intermingled in the crucible of love. The love ceases to be there. The Lord and devotee both come under one and the same condition. They also do not stand distinct. The worldly love of ours is inert but the love there is sentient. There the lovers are overflowed with love. There is no <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharmī</span> and  <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharma</span>. There is only <span class="char-style-override-6">Dharmī</span> alone. It is the pure love. Love is God, love is devotee and love is also love. They are three only for name’s sake. The Lord tries to enhance the joy of the devotee and the devotee does everything for the joy and love of the lord. But there too in the advanced stage the joy and love; the Lord and devotee cease to be different and distinct. They become one—undifferentiated one, for our gross understanding  we may say anything whatsoever. Here it is not <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedāntic</span> non-duality. <span class="char-style-override-6">Vedānta</span> is the path of knowledge and knowledge is predominant there. Here love dominates. No body can forcast its result. Only he can understandwho realises it. ‘Can understand’ is only for the sake of saying. In reality even this much cannot be said. It is not a case of knowing but being. He becomes the same. What he becomes can be known only after becoming that.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What is the way for that? The way is what we are doing. For example, in the conjugal form of devotion śrī Rādhā is <span class="char-style-override-6">hlādinī śakti</span> (joy-promoting potency). She makes the blissful <span class="char-style-override-6">Brahma</span> Lord Kr̥ṣṇa dance out of joy. There are two types of devotion—blissful and loveful. śrī Rādhā provides joy to the Lord so she is the potency of bliss and so is the Lord potency of love. When the Lord becomes the source of joy to śrī Rādhā, there He is potency of joy and śrī Rādhā the potency of love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The people of <span class="char-style-override-6">Goudīya</span> cult hold that Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu was the outcome of the communion of the two. The oneness of the two cannot be explained through any characteristic marks. There is no sign, no characteristics, no qualities. Then what remains to be explained. Whatever is there is only the pure love. God is love and love is God. Rādhā herself is Kr̥ṣṇa and Kr̥ṣṇa Himself is Rādhā.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-3">This stage of oneness is the highest—supremely highest. One  who reaches this state, there remains nothing for him to do. How  his body is conditioned cannot be described. The sun does not enter the mirror. What comes is only the reflection. In our eyes his body is transformed into the Love itself. Just as the mirror becomes dazzling due to the sunlight in the sameway he becomes transmuted into the person of Love. If somebody proceeds with musk on her person, the atoms of its fragrance spread all over. Only a defective nostril may not perceive the fragrance. In the same way when such a person moves he showers and diffuses love. It is said that when Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu walked on the road then even the roads were charged with love. The condition of his body was something beyond narrating to see which people got merged into the love. Such a lover is just a heap of love. By visualising and touching him people used to become saturated with love. Such was his divine state.<span></span></p>
