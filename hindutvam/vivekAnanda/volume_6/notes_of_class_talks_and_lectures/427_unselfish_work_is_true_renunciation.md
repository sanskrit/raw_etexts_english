## UNSELFISH WORK IS TRUE RENUNCIATION

This world is not for cowards. Do not try to fly. Look not for success
or failure. Join yourself to the perfectly unselfish will and work on.
Know that the mind which is born to succeed joins itself to a determined
will and perseveres. You have the right to work, but do not become so
degenerate as to look for results. Work incessantly, but see something
behind the work. Even good deeds can find a man in great bondage.
Therefore be not bound by good deeds or by desire for name and fame.
Those who know this secret pass beyond this round of birth and death and
become immortal.

The ordinary Sannyâsin gives up the world, goes out, and thinks of God.
The real Sannyâsin lives in the world, but is not of it. Those who deny
themselves, live in the forest, and chew the cud of unsatisfied desires
are not true renouncers. Live in the midst of the battle of life. Anyone
can keep calm in a cave or when asleep. Stand in the whirl and madness
of action and reach the Centre. If you have found the Centre, you cannot
be moved.
