## CV

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7369e8105.pdf)* )

*To Sri Haripada Mitra*

SRINAGAR, KASHMIR,  
*1897*.

DEAR HARIPADA,

My health has been very bad for the last nine months, and the heat made
it still worse. So I have been wandering over the hills from place to
place. Now I am in Kashmir. I have travelled far and wide, but I have
never seen such a country. I shall soon leave for the Punjab and again
go to work. From Sadananda I have heard all the news about you and
continue to get it. I am sure to go to Karachi after visiting the
Punjab. So we shall meet in person there. 

With blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
