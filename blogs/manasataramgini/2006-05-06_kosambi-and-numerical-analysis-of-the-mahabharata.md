+++
Various kinds of numerical analysis on the mahAbhArata need to be
carried out. The pioneers in this were the two unlikeable characters DD
Kosambi and E Kulkarni. The former was definitely a very learned man,
with whom I share intellectual and some what ascetic inclinations.
Ironically, his father was the mahA-nAstIka who had converted to the
bauddha heresy and studied none other than the archaic parama-pAShaNDa
buddhaghoSha at great length. buddhaghoSha had called upon bauddha-s to
not to attend narrations or recitals of the AkhyAna-s like the
mahAbhArata and the rAmAyaNa. 

DD Kosambi had inherited many of the
tendencies of his father like being a Marxist who saw Indian history
through the delusions of the red-book, in addition to the bauddha
heresy. Yet as an intellectual and Sanskrit scholar he was way ahead of
the rest. We went to the same college, though I was not born when he
died. He was thrown out of that college, where he was a mathematics
lecturer, because his intellectual leanings did not go well with the
plebeians around him (I can fully well appreciate that given the kind of
students who attend this well-known college). 

I recall sitting in the
lecture hall where he used to teach, when I was reading his statistical
analysis of the mahAbhArata. It was a pioneering work for its time,
using distribution of upa-parvan length and syllable statistics to study
the concordance between the critical edition initiated by Sukthankar and
the parvasaMgraha section. The implications of this study, and a more
modern overview, need to be narrated at some point. 

In several ways
Damodar Kosambi was like Rahul Sankrityayan another Marxist historian–
both were genuine scholars whose intellectual breadth should be
appreciated. Both were however deluded simultaneously by the bauddha
heresy and the red-book of the bearded German. Thus, all their
scholarship took grotesque final shapes, though there is a lot of useful
primary data in their works. In this they differ from the empty pots
like Thapar and the other allied communist historians, including the
degraded brahmin Subrahmanyan.
