title = "The weakness of Russia"

+++
The recent string of Islamic attacks and the spineless Russian response
have shown that Russia has indeed lost its edge. In the case of India
one can easily see how it is really a weak country and not really
capable of standing up to the Americans. So when the Americans and the
West ask India to show restrain even when punched by the Mohammedans,
India obeys with nothing more than a mild protest. However, Russia has
nuclear weapons that can indeed seriously threaten the US, and it is
unlikely that the US can do much to Russia directly. Russia has the
resources to carry itself and it has proven itself in battle against the
superior and ruthless army of the Nazis. Despite this Russia has thus
far shown hardly any signs of acting decisively. To the contrary Putin
admitted that they were weak.
