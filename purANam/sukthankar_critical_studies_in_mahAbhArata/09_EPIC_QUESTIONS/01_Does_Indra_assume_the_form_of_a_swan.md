Mbh. (Crit. Ed.) 1. 57.21 : Msyartipeiia samkaralf. 

This is the second pada of a stanza occurring in the AdipaVvan which 
reads : 

bhagavm pujydte catra hdsyarupej^ta samkarah j 

svayatn eva grhitena Vasoh prltyd mohdtmanah || 

The Vulgate (1. 63. 21cd — ^22ab) differs from this only in so far that 
it reads the second quarter of the stanza as hmsarupena cesvamh. 

I have discussed the text-reading briefly in the Annals of the Bhandarkar 
Orientol Research Institute (vol. 16, p. 100 f.) and justified it, in my reply 
to the late Professor Winternitz, who in the course of a lengthy review^ of 
the Adiparvan had drawn attention to it, observing that as the reading was 
a lectio difficilior and was “ far from certain ” it requires a “ wavy line ” . 
While admitting that the reading adopted in the Critical Edition was a lec- 
tio difjicilioT I contended that sin<» the documentary evidence in its favour 
was complete, therefore it need not be regarded as uncertain and there was 
no need of a “wavy line.” There would have been no reason for me now 
to revert to it but for two facts. On the one hand, it has been again, inci- 
dentally, criticized^ by the late lamented Professor J. J. Meyer in his last 
publication, Trilogie dtindischer Mdchte u. Feste d. Vegetation? (Zurich- 
Leipzig 1937),— a thick opus with extremely rich and varied contents, en- 
livened as usual by the author’s spicy wit and trenchant style. On the other 
hand, the reading receives srfme confirmati(»i from a new and unexpected 
source. 

Meyer argues for the reading of the Vulgate, characterizing the hdsya- 
rupena of the Critical Edition as an astonishing (“ verwunderliche”) read- 
ing, and dismissing hdsya- as the stupid mistake of some scribe (“ein dum- 
mer Schreibfehler” ) . 

The context in which the Mbh. stanza occurs is as follows. The righteous 
king Uparicara Vasu, having laid down his arms, retired to the forest and

began, practising penance. Indra and the {2} other gods, apprehending trouble, 
appeared before him, and, dissuading him from continuing his fierce austeri- 
ties; induced him to return to his royal duties. He should rule the king- 
dom of Cedi as Indra’s special friend. As a mark of his favour, Indra pre- 
sented Vasu with various uncommon gifts, among them a crystalline aerial 
car {sphatikani vimanam) and a garland of unfading lotusesf (known as In- 
dramald) which would protect the king against the missiles of his enemies 
and bring him wealth and victory (vmjayantim) . But he gave him also a 
bamboo staff {vainavtm yasiim), which would protect the good {sistdndm 
pratipdlinim) and of course chastise the wicked. King Vasu brought home 
these precious gifts, according the wonderful staff full divine worsliip. That 
was how, we are told, the custom began of bringing from the forest, at a 
certain specified season, the staff, pole or tree, which was then set up, deco- 
rated with flowers, wreaths, flags, and with pilakas — whatever these latter 
are — and worshipped in due form. Here we find the stanza cited above, 
which says in effect that on this occasion Indra is worshipped, according to 
ancient rites, in a certain form assumed by the god of his own accord, out 
of love for Vasu Uparicara. 

What was this form ? Was it the form of a swan, as the Vulgate has 
it and as Meye.r argues ? That is the question . 

Before we try to answer this question, it would be well to examine the 
MS. evidence a little more closely than Meyer appears to have done. The 
important MS. reading (ignoring that of D^), as given in the Critical Edi- 
tion, may be jxit in the following synoptical form : 

N (except K^) hamsarupena 

samkarah (Br, Dn) cesvarah, 

Ki M ( = Text) hdsyarupena} ) 

T. G. Ya^tirupena Vdsavah. 

To this we may now add the important, newly discovered eight hun- 
dred years old Nepali MS. of the Adi (of which I have given full collations 
in ABORI, vol. 19, pp. 201 ff.), which agrees exactly with Ki M and there- 
fore supports the critical text in an unambiguous manner. 

Now let us see what Meyer has to say about these readings. Accord- 
ing to him (p, 5), the original cesvarah (found in the Vulgate) was mis- 
understood as referring to god Siva ; and, with a view to clarifying its mean- 
ing, it was deliberately changed by some scribe into samkarah, which latter 
is a well-known epithet of Siva. And further hdsyarupena of the Critical

Edition is, according to Meyer, as already £3} remarked, nothing more than 
the stupid blunder of some copyist for the original hamsarupena. 

It may be made perfectly clear once for all that at least as far as the 
Mababharata text is concerned, the time when one could juggle with read- 
ings of MSS and lay down the law ex cathedra as to what is the original, 
what is an emendation and what is a scribe’s mistake, is long past. It has 
now become a very much more serious and complicated matter, since the 
publication of the Critical Edition. To entitle anyone to a hearing, he must 
first of all show that he understands the critical appalratus and that he has 
studied the stemma codicum published, by me on p. xxx of the Prolego- 
mena of niy edition of the Adiparvan. 

Let us now go back to the MSS. There we find that samkarailt (of the 
Critical Edition) is documented by the whole of the Northern Recension (in- 
cluding the new Nepali MS.) and the Malayalam version, while cesvarah 
(championed by Meyer) is merely the reading of Br, Dn ! Now one would 
like to know why what Meyer considers the original reading (cesvarah) is 
found only in the most recent version represented by Nilakantha (end of the 
17th century) with the sporadic support of one aberrant Bengali MS. (B 5 ), 
while what he considers a recent emendation (sanikarah is found in still 
older versions represented by MSS. scattered all over India from Kashmir 
to Malabar and from Gujarat to Bengal, including the distant Nepal and 
excepting (in addition to the Vulgate) only the Tamil-Telugu zone, which 
latter has moreover a third and divergent reading (Vdsavah). How is it 
that only the Nilakantha version has preserved the correct reading, while 
all other— much older — versions of North India together with the entire Ma- 
layalam version from the South contain what Meyer regards as a corrup- 
tion ? If samkarah of all N and M MSS. be a corrupt reading, as Meyer 
maintains, then Nilakaittha could have got his cesvarah only by emendation, 
because I do not think that Nilakafr^tha had access to any really old Maha- 
bharata MSS., containing very original readings. In thousands of cases his 
text shows what can be proved, with absolute certainty, to be secondary, in- 
ferior, or corrupt readings. 

This inability on the part of Meyer to recognize in a patently simple 
case what is original and what is secondary shows that he had only very 
vague notions of the relationship between the different recensions, versions 
and manuscripts. And the ignorance of this relationship is absolutely fatal 
to any attempt to discriminate between original readings and emendations and 
scribes’ mistakes. You can never find out an original reading by selecting 
one which suits your purpose, or satisfies your aesthetic sense, or appeals to 
you in some other way, and then looking about for reasons in support of your 
a priori choice; because almost always “ good ” reasons can be found for 
nearly every reading. It is not a qu^tion of dialectic, but £4} of documenta-

tion. And no amount of tendentious arguing will refute the objective evi- 
dence of MSS. 

MSS. in this case clearly prove that the process of alteration has been 
the reverse of what is imagined by Meyer. Here, it is evident, cesv^ah 
has not been changed into samkarah for the sake of clarity, as Meyer main- 
tains ; but, on the other hand, samkarah has been very clearly changed into 
cesvarah — already rendered suspect by the expletive ca — ^perhaps, to avoid 
confusion, samkara being here not the nomen proprium of Siva, but an epithet 
meaning “beneficent, promoting welfare 

We can now turn to the other word of the pada, the more difficult of the 
two: was it hdsyarupena, hamsarupena or yastirupena? Meyer (p. 5) 
rightly rejects the last. It is correct as far as the sense goes ; but it can hardly 
be the original reading. Were it so, no scribe would think of deliberately 
changing it into the obscure and almost unintelligible hdsyarupena or hanisaru- 
pena, both of which are, moreover, graphically unrelated with the former. 
From what we know of scribes’ emendations they tend generally to simplify 
the text, not to complicate it. If that be so, then either hdsyarupena or ham- 
sarupena i^ the correct reading. Moreover y astir upena is confined (like Vd- 
small) ^ to T G, and does not receive any support even from M, which in in- 
numerable cases has preserved — in contradiction to the T G version — the origi- 
nal reading, which has been emended or simplified in T G.^ 

There remains, therefore, only the two alternatives — hdsyarupena given 
by Ki M with the new Nepali MS, and hamsarupeum supported by N (ex- 
cept Kj ) . ByJ the test of the agreement between independent versions,'^ hds- 
yarupena is clearly indicated as the original reading, since we have here an 
agreement between the independent versions of the extreme North and the 
extreme South, it being preferable to hamsarupena, supported only by the 
central sub-recension. It is, moreover, undoubtedly the lectio diffidlwr (as 
was rightly observed by Winternitz in the course of the review mentioned 
above), which accounts for its being surreptitiously ousted by the other. 
Both documentary and intrinsic probability are thus unquestionably in fa- 
vour of the reading hdsyarupena adopted in the Critical Edition. 

What indeed are we to understand by the hamsarupetpa of the Vulgate ? 
The word hamsa has a number of meanings. Monier Williams gives the 
following : 

£51 a goose, gander, swan, flamingo (or other aquatic bird); the soul or spirit 
(sometimes 'the Universal Soul or Supreme Spirit’, identified with Viraj, Narayaoa,

thors ; of one of the Moon’s horses ; of a mountain. 

Meyer (p. 6) has cited copious examples for the meanings of hmhsa 
as the sun, the sun-god, as Vii^inu and as Kr§iiia (son of Dharma). 

Unfortunately none of these fit in the case of Indra. Meyer (p. 6) 
found, however, a loophole in the meaning of hamsa as sungod”, and he sur- 
mised that perhaps the idea of this hamsarupa of Indra was to be dated back 
to the period when Indra was still recognized as a sun-god ! 

Nilakajitha, who has commented on this stanza, had naturally some diffi- 
culty in explaining this hamsarupa. According to him Indra was : hanisaru- 
pena yukto hamSarupt | tasya buddhisthasya rupasya visesariofh svayam eva 
etc. To Nilakaajtha the hamsa^iorm is present only in the mind (buddhistha) 
of the worshipper. To Meyer, on the other hand, who was a realist with a 
vengeance, this explanation naturally did not satisfy. According to him (p. 
4f.), Indra, who is ordinarily invisible to mortals, takes on the concrete form 
of a swan, so as to be visible to Vasu and his subjects. Meyer further found 
(p. 5) the aquatic bird admirably suited to the mirth and gaiety and the 
sportive games that accompany the ceremonial. 

Now which is the original and which is the emendation of these two 
readings ? The characteristic of a scribe’s emendation, as has been well said, 
is that it has all the appearance of improvement without its reality. Ours 
is a case in point, hiomsarupe^ is a phrase under which you can think all 
sorts of things, all equally vague ; but on closer inspection they prove to be 
uniformly inadequate. 

For why should Indra appear before Vasu, or the kings who followed in 
his footsteps, in the form of a swan of all things in the world, whether in a 
concrete shape before the eyes of his worshippers or in an abstract form 
in their minds ? He had assumed one form already : that of the ya^ti the 
staff. Meyer (p. 101) has himself established — ^absolutely incontrovertibly — 
that the tree or the pole or the staff which figures so prominently in the In- 
dramaha ceremony, was worshipped, if not by Vasu, at least by the people 
whom the writer of the Mahabharata account had in mind, as a symbol, {6} an 
image, or an incarnation of Indra himself, and not merely as a remembrance 
of a present from Indra to Vasu. As Meyer ha^ pointed out, the Puraqic 
writers, when speaking of the pde, refer to it unh^itatingly as Indra ” (or 
its synonyms “Sakra”, etc.) in such expressions as Sakr asthma or Indra-

r^pa 268, 6cd say in so many words that here is the god Indra himself, come 
to earth (bhumktha). 

And what a funny form to assume for the thousand-eyed god of gods, 
who had performed a hundred sacrifices, the wielder of the thunder-bolt, the 
destroyer of enemies’ forts, the killer of Vala (or Bala) and Vitra, and the 
hero of a thousand other wonderful exploits : the form of a bamboo staff, with 
wreaths and bells, flags and buntings hanging from it and with those curiously 
shaped pifakas, (sptne of which at any rate, according to Meyer 
(p. 96), were shaped like penies ! It was indeed a laughable form {hdsyaru- 
pa), calculated to provoke mirth and laughter. And this form, it must be 
borne in mind, was not given to Indra by any man ; such a thing would have 
been very likely resented by him. The great god, wishing to do good (iamka- 
ra) to Vasu, had assumed it himself {svayam eva grahitena) out of his great 
love for the high soul Uparicara Vasu {Vasoh prityd mahdtmanah). The 
jocular form — kriddvatdrarupa, as Devabodha^ puts it — assumed by the 
mighty god on this occasion caused great merriment ; and the feast was ac- 
cordingly celebrated with much laughter and gaiety, as described in the Bi*hat- 
samhita, the Vi§pudharmottara and other texts (Meyer, p. 103 f.). 

Thus both documentary probability and intrinsic considerations support 
the reading hdsyarupem ^amharah. This reading is therefore not so asto- 
nishing as Meyer seems to have thought ; but it is astonishing that 
Meyer who had with praiseworthy diligence extracted and trans- 
lated very lengthy passages from about a dozen original sources describing 
the ceremony in great detail, and not found anywhere (except in the Vul- 
gate) the remotest reference to Indra’s assuming the form of a ^wan or to his 
being represented as a swan, should have been so enamoured of the Vulgate 
leading, a reading which I am fully persuaded is nothing more than a scribe’s 
emendation in the archetype of the Central group. But perhaps even Meyer’s 
mistake is not so very astonishing : it is only an example of wishful think- 
ing. Does it not connect Indra with the sun (hamsa) {7} or at least with the 
sun-god ? And Meyer’s whole thesis (pp. 134-144) is that Indra was ori- 
ginally just not a rain-god or a thunder-god, but a sun-g)od, the vernal sun, 
the “ genius ” of fertility and vegetation, in fact, a phallic deity !
