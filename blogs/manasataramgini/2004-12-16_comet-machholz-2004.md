We finally saw comet Machholz 2004 today with my 20X75 binoculars. It
shone as fuzz ball in the southern sky, in the constellation of Eridanus
(The southern river; the celestial yamunA of the Hindus which leads to
the path of death). It was a little above the level of Sirius, the head
of shabala praised at the morning shuna shairya offering of the
pa\~nchavimsha brAhmaNa. I estimate its magnitude as around 4.5 and was
able to perceive a slight tail with the binoculars. It is supposed to
rise higher beyond Orion. I uttered the incantation of the dogs.

Marc took the above photo.
