## CLIV

*To Sister Christine*

21 WEST 34TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,

*21st November 1899*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINA,

Circumstances have so fallen that I have to start for California
tomorrow. It is for my physical benefit too; as the doctor says, I had
better be off where the severe winter of the North cannot reach.

Well, thus my plans are made and marred. Anyway — come over to Cambridge
when you feel like it. Mrs. Bull will only be too happy to do anything
for you she can.

I hope to stop in Detroit on my way back. The Lord's will — as we say.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.
