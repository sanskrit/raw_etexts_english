title = "USA and the Islamic powers: Recent events"

+++
A number of news items are of some interest in terms of the manufacture
of opinion, and the clash of civilizations between the Judaeo-Christian
west and Islam.  
Item 1: The visit of the Iranian president to the US and the Columbia
university. It is very interesting to note how the American media is in
frenzy over the recent antics of Ahmedinejad. Like any other true
believer in the monotheistic prophetic cult Ahmedinejad is a threat to
the world. But there are very many of them all over the world so is he
really that special or dangerous to merit the excitement. Let us note
the following facts:  
1\) Iran was not involved in 9/11  
2\) Iran was an arch enemy of the Taleban, the hosts of Osama and his
gang.  
3\) Iran has not carried out a terrorist strike on US soil and the last
major assault on the US interests was a long time ago using Hezbollah
proxies (Of course they are fomenting trouble for the Americans in Iraq
now, but it is the Americans who got into a hell-hole in the first
because of the being taken for a ride by the Neo-cons).  
4\) Iran is actually too weak to be a direct threat to the US, if the
rulers of the US exhibited common sense.

Yet they are making a big noise about Ahmedinejad yapping at Columbia
University or visiting New York.

In contrast, Pervez Musharraf was invited to New York and treated as a
guest of honor. He was invited to talk his nonsense at the same Columbia
University and also Cornell University (On September 26, 2006), another
famous school in New York. He was feted by the American rulers and media
as a great ally of the US.

Note the following facts now:  
1\) Musharraf was the primary supporter of the Taleban and gave them the
infra-structure to support al-Qaeda.  
2\) It was through his support that al-Qaeda carried out 9/11  
3\) He still hides Osama, Omar and their gang and is supporting the
resurgence of the Taleban in Afghanistan.  
4\) He has been involved in clandestine nuclear proliferation with North
Korea and was a patron of Xerox Khan.  
5\) Most major Islamic terrorist activities conducted against the US
trace back to Pakistani sources which are all orchestrated by
Musharraf.  
6\) While Ahmedinejad is an elected leader, Musharraf is a dictator who
deposed an elected leader. Not that this matters much to the rest of the
world, but US paints a picture of being the beacon of democracy
furthering various democratic causes the world over.

The US media largely praised Musharraf and no one protested against his
visit to the universities in any serious way.

As va\~Nga paNDIta said, the discerning person knows why this is so, and
how opinion is manufactured by the controllers of the American media
contrary to the facts. But it still remains comical on one hand and
tragic on the other to see the American people being fooled so
thoroughly to lose their lives and tax money due the patently delusive
propaganda that the Iran and Iraq posed threats to their lives. Even
more annoying is that Hindus seemed to be taken on this ride too, to act
contrary to their self-interests (vis-a-vis Mushy in particular).

Item 2: The recent events in Iraq have brought to fore the role of
American private armies, such the mercenaries of Blackwater and the
like. These armies of interest to the geopolitical observer. Some
probing shows that a frequent, if not the only constituent, of these
mercenary armies deployed by the US is the following kind of individual:
A macho leukotestate male, fired by ideals of Hollywood gunmen-supermen
on one side, and protestant Isaistic delusions on the other. In essence
he is a crusader a mirror-image of the Mujahideen standing firm in the
fight of the cross against the crescent. Secondly, since regular armies
could always be blamed for crimes against humanity, it is useful to
deploy these unaccountable warriors, especially when they are fired with
Isaistic fervor. Now, the scale of these Isaistic mercenary armies is
particular striking — the one currently in the news headed by a fanatic
Isaistic military-trained chieftain is supposed to have 20,000 men with
their own military base and assault aircraft. No sovereign nation will
allow such private armies, unless they are supported by the rulers. But
the important lesson for us to learn is the potential of such Isaistic
armies to cause harm to us heathens. We already know very well how the
“soft arm” of the leukosphere in the form of various Isaistic
activists- evangelists, priests, NGOs etc operate with impunity in India
converting Hindus and subverting the nation. These soft soldiers are
very likely to be backed-up by these private Isaistic armies of
“contractors”. I believe this is already in place with India, Nepal
and Tibet being major targets and will only increase in the future as
they become relatively jobless in Iraq.

This too va\~Nga paNDita had foreseen but the Hindus sleep on.
