Posted on behalf of Will Bordsen:

‚ÄúGwydion is the Welsh god of magic and wisdom, analogous to the Germanic
Odin and Greek Hermes. In addition to being the leader of the House of
Don, slayer of Pryderi (God of the year, mortality), father figure to
Llew (God of battle, light) and creator of Blodeuwedd (Goddess of
flowers, dawn)‚Ä¶.. he is the originator of April Fools Day üôÇ

Arianrhod (Goddess of the moon) had placed a curse on Llew which made
him unable to carry a weapon. To remove the curse, on the first of
April, Gwydion and Llew assumed the forms of traveling bards and visited
Arianrhod‚Äôs castle. Awhile after arriving, Gwydion conjured the illusion
of a powerful invading army that looked like it was there to invade the
castle. Panicked, Arianrhod casted a spell that gave each man at her
castle an enchanted weapon, thereby removing the curse she had placed on
Llew, who would become the most powerful warrior in the Welsh pantheon.

Hail Gwydion!‚Äù
