## CXXI

THE MATH,  
*21st April, 1902*.

DEAR JOE, (Miss Josephine MacLeod.)

It seems the plan of going to Japan seems to have come to nought. Mrs.
Bull is gone, you are going. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the
Japanese.

Sadananda has accompanied the Japanese to Nepal along with Kanai.
Christine could not start earlier, as Margot could not go till the end
of this month.

I am getting on splendidly, they say, but yet very weak and no water to
drink. Anyhow the chemical analysis shows a great improvement. The
swelling about the feet and the complaints have all disappeared.

Give my infinite love to Lady Betty and Mr. Leggett, to Alberta and
Holly — the baby has my blessings from before birth and will have for
ever.

How did you like Mayavati? Write me a line about it.

With everlasting love,

VIVEKANANDA.
