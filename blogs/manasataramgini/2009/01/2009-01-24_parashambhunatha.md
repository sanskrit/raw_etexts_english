The tradition holds that the triad ravi, shashi and shuchI are
respectively shown in their piNDa form as the bIja-s: haM, saM and raM.
They are combined with the great kulayoginI manifesting as chitparAMbA
and the bhairava manifest parashambhunAtha. Hence we get their mantra as
OM haM saM raM chitparAMbA-parashaMbhunAthAbhyAm namaH |  
Or in their elemental forms we have for the bhairava: h-s-rauM and for
the kulayoginI: s-h-rauM.  
In the middle of the chakra dwells the conjoined pair of chitparAMbA and
parashaMbhunAtha. Around them are the 32 emanations of parA devI seated
on the laps the 32 bhairava-s emanating from parashaMbhunAtha.
