## CXVII

14 GREYCOAT GARDENS,  
WESTMINSTER, LONDON S.W.,  
*3rd Dec., 1896.*

DEAR ALBERTA,

Herewith I enclose a letter of Mabel to Joe Joe to you. I have enjoyed
the news in it very much and so I am sure you will.

I am to start from here for India on the 16th and to take the steamer at
Naples. I will, therefore, be in Italy for some days and in Rome for
three or four days. I will be very happy to look in to say good-bye to
you.

Capt. and Mrs. Sevier from England are going to India with me, and they
will be with me in Italy of course. You saw them last summer.

I intend to return to the U.S. and to Europe thence in about a year.

With all love and blessings,

VIVEKANANDA.
