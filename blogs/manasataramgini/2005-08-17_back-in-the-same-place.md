We were set to return to the same battlefield where we had last year
fought one of the most disastrous battles of our existence. This
battlefield was worse than the pAShaNDa hill: there we had lost out
right, but here we had won the battle and the booty we took home was
poisoned. It gave us no pleasure to go there but we had to do our part
in the larger struggle. When we went to tthat field last time our mind
was filled with a desperate sense of anxiety over the war that was to be
fought. We had carefully planned every move, and everything went as per
plan except a strange event which was a actually the shakuna we had
missed at that time. Our mantras fired in unison and it looked as though
we were the winners. We did not know the monstrous consequences that
were waiting for us like a rakSha. The shachiva had seen something amiss
but failed to alert us sufficiently.

This time we go with no such anxiety of the outcome of the war or that
tense expectation of the unknown. We know everything now, and its all
about the despair arising from everything that we now know. We only go
there with the question how bad can it get? This time we are not even
taking steps to proctect the baggage train as we did last time. It is
just a charge with whatever few troops we can muster.
