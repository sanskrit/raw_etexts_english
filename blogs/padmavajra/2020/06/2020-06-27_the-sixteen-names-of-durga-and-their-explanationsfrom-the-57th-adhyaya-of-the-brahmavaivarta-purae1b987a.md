atha śoḍaśanāmnāṃ ca sarveṣāmīpsitaṃ varaṃ।  
brūhi vedavidāṃ śreṣṭhaṃ vedoktaṃ sarvasampatam॥  
  
O best of the ones learned in the vedas, please kindly state the
meanings of the sixteen names which bestow welfare upon all and are
mentioned in the veda.

kena vā pūjitā sadak dvitīye kena vā pūrā।  
tṛtīye vā catūrthe vā kena sarvatra pūjitā॥

Who was the first to worship Her?After that, who was the second, third
and fourth to worship Her?

nārāyaṇa uvāca

atha ṣoḍaśanāmnāṃ sa viṣṇuvedi cakāra saḥ।  
jñātvā punaḥ pṛccasi tvaṃ kathayāmi yathāgamam॥  
  
Nārāyaṇa said:Viṣṇu has already given the sixteen names in the vedas and
you are well aware of them. In spite of that you are asking me the
question again and I am now speaking what has been said in the śāstra.  

durgo daitye mahāvighne bhavabandhe ca karmaṇi।  
śoke duḥkhe ca narake yamadaṇḍe ca janmani॥  
mahābhaye’tiroge cāpyāśabdo hantṛvācakaḥ।  
etānhantyeva yā devī sā ḍurga parikīrtitā॥

The word ‘Durga’ stands for a daitya who was a great obstruction
representing worldly bondage,karmas,sorrows,hells,yama’s rod,
births,great dangers, disease and ‘a’ represents the killer of the same.
Therefore the one who destroys them all is famed as ‘Durgā’.

yaśasā tejasā rūpairnārāyaṇasamā guṇaiḥ।  
śaktirnārāyaṇasyeyaṃ ṭena nārāyaṇī smṛtā॥

In glory,lusture,beauty and qualities She is like Nārāyaṇa and She is
His śakti. Hence She is called Nārāyaṇī.

īśānaḥ sarvasiddharthe cāśabdo dātṛvācakaḥ।  
sarvasiddhipradātrī yā sā’pīśānā prakīrtitā॥

Īśāna is a word used for sarvasiddhi(all-accomplishment) and ‘ā’ stands
for its giver. Therefore the one who bestows sarvasiddhi is called
Īśānā.

sṛṣṭā māyā purā sṛṣṭau viṣṇunā paramātmanā।  
mohitaṃ māyayā viśvaṃ viṣṇumāyā prakīrtitā॥

In times of yore,Viṣnu created māyā,by means of which the whole universe
was deluded by Her. She is thus called Viṣnumāyā.

śive kalyāṇarūpā ca śivadā ca śivapriyā।  
priye dātari cāśabdo śivā tena prakīrtitā॥

She’s beloved of Śiva and is the form of Śiva’s auspiciousness and giver
of Śiva,hence She is called Śivā.

sadbuddhyadhiṣātṛdevī vidyamānā yuge yuge।  
pativratā suśīlā ca sā satī parikīrtitā॥

Every Yuga after Yuga,She’s the presiding deity of sad-buddhi(right
intelligence),She is a chaste lady and well-disposed,hence She is called
Satī.

yathā nityo hi bhagavān nityā bhagavatī tathā।  
svamāyayā tirobhūtā tatreśe prākṛte laye॥  
ābrahmastambaparyantaṃ sarvaṃ mithyaiva kṛtrimam।  
dūrgā satyasvarūpā sā prakṛtirbhagavānyathā॥  
siddhaiśvaryādikaṃ sarvaṃ yasyāmasti yuge yuge।  
saiddhādike bhago jñeyastena sā bhagavatī smṛtā॥

She is eternal like Viṣṇu,and merges into Him at the time of the
dissolution of the universe. Everything from a straw to Brahmā is
transient and artificial(in contrast). She is also of the nature of
Satya(truth) like Viṣṇu. ‘Bhaga’ denotes all siddhi and
aiśvarya(lordliness/wealth),and since She is of that nature,She is
called ‘Bhagavatī’.  

sarvānmokṣaṃ prāpayati janmamṛtyujarādikaṃ।  
carācarāśca viśvasthāñcharvāṇī tena kīrtitā॥

She gives mokṣa to all and is the cause of birth, death and old age of
all, hence She is called Śarvāṇī.

maṅgalaṃ mokṣavacanaṃ cāśabdo dātṛvācakaḥ।  
sarvānmokṣānyā dadādi saivasyātsarvamaṅgalā॥

The word ‘Maṇgala’ means auspiciousness and ‘ā’ stands for its giver.
Since she gives auspiciousness to all,She is called sarvamaṇgalā.

harṣe saṃpādi kalyāṇe maṅgalaṃ parikīrtitaṃ।  
tāndadāti ca sarvebhyastena sā sarvamaṅgalā॥

The word ‘Maṇgala’ means pleasures and auspiciousness which She bestows
upon all. Hence She is called Sarvamaṇgalā.

ambeti mātṛvacano vandane pūjate sadā।  
pūjitā vanditā yātā jagatāṃ tena sā’mbikā॥

The word Ambā means mother and is used for worship and adoration.
Hence,the Mother who is worshipped by all is called Ambikā.

viṣṇubhaktā viṣṇurūpā viṣṇoḥ śaktisvarūpiṇī।  
sṛṣṭau ca viṣṇunā sraṣṭā vaiṣṇavī tena kīrtitā॥

The devotees of Viṣṇu call Her Vaiṣṇavī because She is the form and
energy of Viṣṇu,and by Her is the whole universe is created.

gauraḥ pīte ca nirlipte pare brahmāṇi nirmale।  
tasyātmanaḥ śaktiriyaṃ gaurī ṭena prakīrtitā॥  
guruḥ śambhuśca sareveṣāṃ tasya śaktiḥ priyā sati।  
guruḥ kṛṣṇaśca tanmāyā gaurī tena prakīrtitā॥  
tithibhede parvabhede kalpabhede’nyabhedake।  
khyātau teṣu ca vikhyātā pārvatī tena kīrtitā॥  
mahotsavaviśeṣe ca parvatriti sukīrtitā।  
tasyādhidevī yā sā ca pārvatī parikīrtitā॥  
parvatasya sutā devī sāvirbhūtā ca parvate।  
parvatādhiṣṭhātṛdevī pārvatī tena kīrtitā॥

She is golden complexioned, clad in yellow garments, unattached and
spotless. Because She is the śakti of the Ātman She is called Gaurī.
She’s is tithibheda,kalpabheda,and one who causes the bhedas between
these tithes,kalpas and other bhedas. She is thus called Pārvatī. During
special celebrations, the word pavan is used, and since She is the
Goddess of all parvenus,She is called Pārvatī. She is also called
Pārvatī because She is the daughter of the mountain, appeared over the
(Himalaya) mountain, and is the Goddess of mountains.

The word ‘sanā’ is used for all times, and in expanded form,’tanī’ is
added to it. Since She is present in all times and all places,She is
called Sanātanī. O sage,I have explained the meanings of Her sixteen
names. I am now narrating the stories of Her as told in the vedas.
Listen to me!

prathame pūjitā sā ca kṛṣṇena paramātmanā।  
vṛndāvane ca sṛṣṭyādau goloke rāsamaṇḍale॥  
madhukaiṭabhabhītena brahmaṇā sā dvitīyate।  
tripurapraritenaiva tṛtiye ca tripurāriṇā॥  
bhraṣṭaśriyā mahendreṇa śāpāhurvāsasaḥ purā।  
caturthe pūjitā devī bhaktyā bhagavatī satī॥  
tadā munīndraiḥ siddhendrairdevaiśca munipuṅgavaiḥ।  
pūjitā sarvaviśveṣu samabhūtsarvataḥ sadā॥

In times of yore, at the beginning of creation and in the Rāsamaṇdala of
Goloka in Vṛndāvana,Kṛṣṇa adored Her. Secondly,Brahmā adored Her to get
relief from Madhu and Kaiṭabha. Thirdly,Śiva adored Her when He went to
war with Tripura. Fourthly,Indra adored Her after He was cursed by
Durvāsā,as a result of which He lost all riches and glory. Since
then,She has been popularly adored by all the sages,siddhas,Gods and
Ṛṣis everywhere.

The text after this then alludes to Suratha and Samādhi who adored the
Goddess,and one attained the position of Sāvarṇi manu while Samādhi
attained Goloka by Her grace.
