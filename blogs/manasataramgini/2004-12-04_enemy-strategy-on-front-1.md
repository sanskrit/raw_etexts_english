title = "Enemy strategy on frontxa0#1"

+++
The enemy forces did not strike on front \#1 as we had expected. Our
spies inform us that they have decided to instead pause futher
hostilities on front \#1 and instead resort to the Trojan horse
strategy. In our “Gaugamela”, which was in a month of blazing heat we
had fallen prey to that strategy and lost terribly. We, however, learnt
our lesson, even if it came at a high cost. We get the temptation to
attack but given our inability to hit the capital we have decided to
wait silently.
