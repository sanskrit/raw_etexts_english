## Mahābhārata
It is well-known that the Mahābhārata has come down to us in two recensions, 
the Northern and the Southern. The editors of the Poona Critical Edition (1933-70)1 of 
the epic determined, in the process of collating and isolating the archetype of the epic, 
that its Northern Recension (NR) constitutes in general what is called in textual 
scholarship the editio simplicior, the naive or the original text, and they created the 
Critical Edition (CE) from the irreducible archetype of the NR texts, the Śārada codex of 
the Kashmir region in the northwest of South Asia. They found likewise that the 
Southern Recension (SR) was generically an editio ornatio, an ornate text, a version 
made consciously and systematically: all hundred Kaurava brothers get named, all but a 
few with the pejorative du prefix; the 18 parvans of NR rise to 24 in the SR, with many 
insertions and transpositions of crucial episodes within parvans (those of Śakuntalā and 
Yayāti, for example, in the Ādiparvan); further, the SR is overlaid with a Brahmanical 
ideology, already incipient in the NR. 

Of even greater interest was their discovery that the Malayalam version of the SR 
texts was itself an editio simplicior, albeit of the SR-ornatio text: it was the shortest of the SR texts which included the Telugu-Grantha versions of the SR tradition. It also 
aligned itself with the Śārada version of the NR texts. This made no geographical sense, 
as was noticed forthrightly by V.S.Sukthankar, the life spirit behind the CE.2 Logically, 
when a text radiates over a wide area, the versions at the farthest belts of radiation tend to 
be at greatest variance with the founding text, more so, than those in the inner belts: we 
see this in the eastward radiation of the Śārada text, the first formation of Sukthankar’s γ- 
sub-recension (Sukthankar 1933: lxxiii; see below, Section A, for Sukthankar’s master 
chart of recensions and versions) and the North-Eastern versions in Nepali, Maithili, and 
Bengali scripts. By a similar logic for the southward radiation of the epic along the well 
traveled and traditional dakṣiṇāpatha as the transmission route,3 the Malayalam version, 
being at the outermost extent of the Mahābhārata radiation, should also be far more 
differentiated than those, like the Tamil (Grantha) and Telugu versions, in the intervening 
space. Yet it was the shortest of the Southern Recension texts, being to it what the 
Śārada codex was to the NR (Dandekar 1961 [XI]: xlix). More anomalously, the 
Malayalam version was also found to align itself regularly with the Śārada text, “a fact all 
the more impressive because M[alayalam], a Southern version, hails from the province at 
the opposite end of India from the province of Ś[ārada], a Northern version” (Sukthankar 
1933 [I]: lxxiv)—indeed, across the vast buffer zone of the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu 
version of the SR Mahābhārata tradition between itself and the Northern Recension 
texts. In fact, some of the grossest inflations of the text and thus possibly the latest are 
found to occur in the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu versions (see below). 
The preparation of the CE of the Mahābhārata was not contingent on solutions to 
these anomalies, so we have a consensus Critical Edition of the text, but I believe that the 
seeming anomalies right themselves out, opening thereby a way to a correct assessment 
of the textual history of the SR text of the epic and perhaps the Mahābhārata tradition 
itself, if we approach the entire problem from the perspective of Brahman migrations to 
the south, the irreducible human agency that brought Sanskrit texts—oral or literate—to 
peninsular India through the dakṣiṇāpatha. As we will see, all the Mahābhārata 
manuscripts that went to Poona [Pune] from peninsular India were from Brahman centers 
of learning, or facilities with intimate links to Brahman communities of the area. The 
textual history and transmission of the epic are thus inextricably intertwined with the 
Brahman migrations to the south. We will also see that the Mahābhārata passes on to 
non-Brahman groups in time, both in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, to form staples of the 
kūṭiyāṭṭam and kathakaḷi repertories in the former and that of the kūttu repertory in the 
latter, but there can be little doubt that its first migrations to South India were in Brahman 
hands. 

## Migrations
In on-going work,4 I show that two distinct waves of Brahmans arrived in the 
Tamil-Kerala country in the pre-modern period from the Vedic regions of Northern India, 
adhering to two separate śrauta praxises, the first wearing their traditional hair tuft-- 
kuṭumi in Tamil--in front and thus collectively known as Pūrvaśikhā, and the second, 
Aparaśikhā, wearing it toward the back, as a pony tail (See Illustrations A and B 
respectively).5 I address below the question if other Brahmans or Brahman groups 
arrived in the Tamil country for our historical period, 50 BCE to 1350 CE. We will see 
that only these two Brahmans groups can be linked to srautism, and thus to a Vedic 
home, extant or in epigraphy. Moreover, as we will see, between them, they exhaust all 
the Brahman groups of the area in Thurston (1909), our most important ethnographic 
source of Brahman groups. 

My specific thesis with respect to the Brahman migrations of the two groups and 
the epic is that what Sukthankar isolates as the Śārada text, his archetype for the epic and 
basis for the CE of Mahābhārata epic or a text very close to it, say *Śārada version, came 
to the Tamil country with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans by the beginnings of the Common 
Era (CE): these Brahmans with their fronted tuft are well attested in the Sangam poetry, 
ca. 50 BCE to 250 CE, and they created from the *Śārada text what has come down to us 
as SR in the first four or five centuries of CE. I will designate this *Pūrvaśikhā text of 
the SR of the Mahābhārata. This *Śārada text present in the Sangam Tamil country, 
being made in the first half of the millennium CE into the *Pūrvaśikhā SR text, supplied 
the knowledge of the epic displayed in the poetry of the Sangam anthologies, these 
perhaps being composed simultaneously with the *Pūrvaśikhā text, the basis perhaps 
even for a Sangam Era translation of the epic, Perutēvanār’s lost Pāratam.6 At the close 
of the Sangam period of Tamil history, brought about by the Kaḷabhra Interregnum, ca. 
4th to 7th CE, a far-reachingly disruptive moment in Tamil history, a branch of the 
Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans moved to the Malabar region of Kerala, later the historical 
Nambudiri Brahmans of Kerala, through the Palghat gaps, a travel route already in long 
use,7 with the *Pūrvaśikhā text, the text remaining there in relative isolation till 1920’s 
when summoned to Poona for the CE. Further, the *Pūrvaśikhā text remained behind in 
the Tamil country as well with the rump Pūrvaśikhā group, the historically Tamil- 
speaking Śōḻiya Brahmans, the formative Brahman component of the Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism in 
7-9th centuries CE and thus transfusing the Kṛṣṇa myths of the Mahābhārata, especially 
from its khila (or appendix) portions, the Harivaṃśa, into the emerging Vaiṣṇava Bhakti 
poetry. 

I will be designating this the Σ-text: it is still an SR text and is identical to the text 
that went to Malabar with the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās, but I have designated a Greek 
letter for it as it will host Sukthankar’s σ-text (see Section A below for Sukthankar’s 
master chart of the epic’s different recensions and script-based versions): the σ-text is an 
imaginary text he constructs from the evidence in the manuscripts that came to Poona for 
collation purposes. He sees that all Grantha-Telugu versions of the epic were of the SR 
mould, but unlike the Malayalam version of the SR with its allegiance to the *Śārada text 
of the NR tradition, the Grantha-Telugu texts’ allegiance lies with a longer, inflated 
version of NR, part of the γ-family of texts. The SR mould in this complex is my Σ-text, 
the *Pūrvaśikhā text resident in the Tamil country after the departure of the Nambudiri 
Pūrvaśikhās to Malabar through the Palghat gaps and finding itself hosting the arrival of 
the Aparaśikhā Brahmans and their NR σ-text. The SR-NR admixture seen in the 
Grantha-Telugu versions—an SR mould but with great infusions of métier, what comes 
to be called “excesses” of the SR text, from an NR text-- is one of the more direct proofs 
in support of the thesis advanced here: Sukthankar’s hypothetical σ-text, derived by him 
entirely from textual evidence of his manuscripts, is verified by the evidence from the 
 Brahman migrations. 

I would be suggesting that this text came with the second Brahman group of my 
study, beginning to arrive at the upper peninsular regions from 5th century CE onward, 
reaching the Tamil country proper in significant numbers by 8th CE. Their arrival in the 
Tamil country is one of the best documented instances of large scale migrations of people 
anywhere in pre-modern history. Elsewhere I characterize them as the Burton Stein 
Brahmans, after the historian’s path-breaking analysis of their pivotal role in the history 
Tamil Nadu from the pre-modern times to the modern period although his extreme stress 
on local autonomy, as a segmentary feature of the Cōḷa state, has been questioned and 
moderated (Karashima 1984; Champakalakshmi 2001).8 The Pallavas (4th to 10th 
centuries, CE), later the Cōḻas (10th-14th centuries CE) and the subsequent Pāṇṭiya and 
Nāyaka kingdoms, are their patrons, and they constitute the subject of the famous 
Pallava-Cōḷa Copper Plate epigraphy, with every immigrant’s name, the number of shares 
of the land granted to his family, his Veda śākha in the form of its sūtra, his gotra, his 
titles of Vedic learning, and in the most elaborate deeds, his place of domicile before 
arrival in the Tamil country recorded in copper plates that regularly turned up at the 
tilling of the paddy fields of the Tamil country throughout 20th century. The initial deeds 
show them settling in the north and north-east parts of the Tamil country, the 
Tonṭaimanṭalam area and its northern outskirts in the Vēnkata hills and what is southern 
Andhra Pradesh today, and later deeds, the Kaveri delta. Their places of domicile before 
arrival in the Tamil country are, in most cases, villages in southern Andhra Pradesh, but 
these Brahmans as a whole are traceable from their Śrauta Sūtra traditions ultimately to 
the Mathurā region of the Yamunā river (see below). And these show them to be 
following different śrauta traditions from those of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans. 
A stemma chart of the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata epic would look like this: 

- *Sārada Text (ca. 150 BCE) ¦ *Pūrvaśikhā Text (ca. 50 BCE-500 CE) 
- Nambudiri *Pūrvaśikhā text----------------*Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhā text (Σ-text)  
- (Malayalam version [500-1920’s CE]) ----*Suktankar’s σ-text , Tamil and Telugu versions (>500-1920’s CE) 

I seek below to correlate the above stemma chart of the SR, first with its putative 
agents, the Brahmans and their migrations to the peninsular region from their Vedic 
homelands, and secondly with the requisite paleography for the literate transcriptions of 
the texts. We will see that the findings presented here in terms of the relevant human 
agency and script substantially extend our current understanding of the rise of the 
Mahābhārata tradition. The communis opinio of our ideas about this may be reduced to 
what may be called the Hiltebeitel-Witzel model: the Hiltebeitel (2001; 2005) part of the 
model addressing issues relating to the literate redaction of the epic by a human agency, 
an inter- or trans-generational “committee of out of sorts Brahmans,” ca. 150 BCE and 
the Witzel (2005) half providing a possible venue for this textualization event in the 
reformist Hindu-Vedic kingdom, like the Śuṅga dynasty, promoting the Vedic traditions, 
possibly the core métier of the epic deriving from a Vedic event, the Ten King’s Battle 
referred to at ṚV 7.18.5-10; 33. 3, 5. The work presented here may be said to address the 
default conclusions from this model: can we characterize the Brahmanical redactorial 
agency with any historical precision? What script aided the redactorial process, and what 
might have been the physical manuscript aiding the textualization? Further, I address 
how this nascent text, what I have designated as *Śārada text, came to the south by the 
Sangam age serving as a template for the creation of the first SR text, the *Pūrvaśikhā 
text, thus explaining the anomalies of the textual history of the SR listed above from 
Sukthankar. 
In sum, then, a version of the epic close to the Śārada text, *Sarada text, leaves 
North India sometime after its redaction, ca.250-150 BCE, with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans 
in a *Southern Brāhmī script9, most likely the parent of the extant Grantha script, in palm 
leaf manuscript or birch bark.10 The SR of the epic is forged from this in the following 
half-millennium, reaching a final form by 500 CE, the *Pūrvaśikhā text, the Grantha 
script taking shape in the process, the palm leaves of South India with the iron stylus 
technology of writing serving the transcription. About this time, both the text and script 
go to the Malabar area of Kerala with one branch of the Pūrvaśikhā group which emerges 
in time as the historical Nambudiri group, and goes into seeming hibernation for the next 
1500 years till summoned to Poona for the preparation of the CE. This is the text that 
came to Poona in the 20th century, in the 1920’s, which the CE editors found to be the 
shortest version of the SR texts and thus anomalous. 
What has not been recognized is that the *Pūrvaśikhā text (the Σ-text in my 
designation; see below for more details) remains with the rump Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhā group 
in the Tamil country, playing a far more active role in the subsequent history of the 
peninsular region. It shapes the Āḻvār Vaiṣṇavism, emerging in the centuries following 
the Kaḷabhra Interregnum, all four Brahman Āḻvārs being by tradition Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās. 
It also hosts the σ-Aparaśikhā text as it arrives in the Tamil country ca. 8th century 
onward and shapes the subsequent textual history of the epic in the Tamil country, 
resulting in the Tamil and Telugu versions. I present these findings in the following 
sequence: 

- Section A sets forth the relevant details of the epic in its different recensions and 
versions. 
- Section B is concerned with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans under the following 
aspects: 
  - i. the origins of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, their śrauta traditions, and 
their migration southward. 
  - ii. their presence in the Sangam Tamil country and the creation of the 
*Pūrvaśikā text of the Mahābhārata. 
  - iii. the Kaḷabhra Interregnum and the dispersal of the Pūrvaśikhā 
group. 
  - iv. the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās and *Pūrvaśikhā text in the Malabar 
area of the emerging Kerala. 
  - v. the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās, the *Pūrvaśikhā text, and the Āḻvār 
Vaiṣṇavism. 
  - vi. the *Pūrvaśikhā text and the Poona Critical Edition 
- Section C examines the Aparaśikhā Brahmans and their bearing on the textual 
history of the Mahābhārata: 
  - i. the origins of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, their Śrauta traditions and their arrival in the Tamil country. 
  - ii. the Pallava period epigraphy about the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. 
  - iii. the Cōḷa period epigraphy about the Aparaśikhā Brahmans. 
  - iv. the emergence of the Aparaśikhā Śrīvaiṣṇavism in its Ācārya phase. 10 
  - v. the Tamil and Telugu versions of the Mahābhārata. 
  - vi. the Tamil and Telugu Mahābhārata and the Poona Critical Edition. 
- In Section D, I provide further proof for the above from the history of the Tamil- 
Malayalam paleography as has been constructed by I. Mahadevan (2003): 
    - i. Introduction and an over-view of Mahadevan’s findings 
    - ii. the Tamil Brāhmī script and its history 
    - iii. the Southern Brāhmī script and its history 
    - iv. the Brahmans, the epics and paleography
