**Introduction**  
Several sub-schools of the Taittirīya school of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda
possess their own collections of mantra-s distinct from their saṃhitā-s
known as the mantra-pāṭha-s. These include mantra-s that are often found
in other traditions but not in their own saṃhitā or brāhmaṇa.
Additionally, they also include some mantra-s which are unique to these
mantra-pāṭha-s. For example the famous Yajurvedic version of the
Śrīsūkta is found in the mantra-pāṭha of Bodhāyana. However, most
practitioners in South India do not correctly use the accents of this
sūkta and seem to be unaware that the KYV version of this sūkta occurs
in this text. The mantra-paṭha-s of the Āpastamba, Bodhāyana, Vaikhānasa
and Hiraṇyakeśin sub-schools have come down to us. The mantra-s in them
are typically deployed in gṛhya rituals directed by instructions from
their gṛhyasūtra-s. However, the Vaikhānasa-mantra-pāṭha is distinctive
in having a late terminal part that is used in the iconic worship of
Viṣṇu by the Vaikhānasa-s. The Hiraṇyakeśī-mantra-pāṭha has a
ṛk-saṃhitā as part of it and is used by the Hiraṇyakeśīn-s of
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu in their rituals to this date. In someways
this is reminiscent of the hautra-pariśiṣṭha of the Āpastamba-s that is
used by Yajurvedin-s to supplement the role normally performed by the
Ṛgvedin hotṛ.

Other than these mantra-pāṭha-s of the KYV, we also have comparable
supplementary mantra-collections among the Sāmavedin-s in their
Mantrabrāhmaṇa and the famous khila of the RV. Further, beyond the
Taittirīya school, the Kaṭha school, which was once widespread in the
northern parts of the subcontinent like Kashmir and the Panjab, had it
own mantra-paṭha that went along with their gṛhyasūtra, namely that of
Laugākṣi. While the original form of this mantra-paṭha does not survive
to my knowledge, a version of it with accretions of tāntrika and
paurānika material used in smārta practice by the brāhmaṇa-s of Kashmir
and some of their counterparts in Himachal Pradesh has come down to us.
This text was published by the Kashmirian brāhmaṇa-s Keśava Bhaṭṭa and
Kāśīnātha-śarman in the first half of the 1900s. I had earlier examined
a defective version of this text but thanks to the massive text-scanning
effort of the eGangotri Trust of the texts at the Kashmir Research
Institute, Srinagar we can now examine a better version of this text.

The melding of tāntrika and vaidika tradition found in this Kashmirian
text has a long history in Hindu tradition. Indeed, as we have pointed
out before\[footnote 1\], a small mantra-saṃhitā comparable to the
mantra-pāṭha-s is found preserved in the śākta-purāṇa, the Devī-purāṇa,
which might preserve a distinct vaidika tradition. Similarly, the
Āṅgirasakalpa of the Paippalāda school of the Atharvaveda preserves a
combined mantra-deployment of Paippalāda AV mantra-s along with
tāntrika-vidyā-s. With regard to the AV tradition one may also point to
the Tripurārṇava-tantra, an authoritative mūla-tantra of the Śrīkula
tradition. The
![20^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=20%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"20^{th}") taraṃga of this text preserves a combined tāntrika-vaidika
mantra-deployment for the Indramahotsva (the great festival of Indra)
which associates itself the AV. This association is likely genuine for
the AV is the one vaidika tradition that has clear injunctions for the
Indramahotsva in its pariśiṣṭha-s. This section of the
Tripurārṇava-tantra specifies several vaidika mantra-s that are to be
used in the worship of Indra and other deva-s, which are combined with
the worship of the Bhairava of the Śrīkula tradition under the tāntrika
scheme.

Our Kashmirian text associated with the Kaṭha school, like other
mantra-paṭha-s, has some unique Vedic material. One such is the
Bhadrasūkta which is the topic of this note. This sūkta of 22 ṛk-s is
to our knowledge not found in any other saṃhitā. It is mostly comprised
of regular jagati-s (12-12-12-12), with the last ṛk being a triṣṭubh
(11-11-11-11). There may be some hypermetrical verses like ṛk-17
(12-12-12-13). The sūkta has a form rather similar to the RV7.35 of
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi. Like that one it is a vaiśvadeva-sūkta, which
invokes the entire pantheon for luck or felicity. In RV7.35 the word for
luck or felicity is the indeclinable śam. In our sūkta the word bhadra
is used instead. It is used as an adjective that declines as the deity
being invoked with the dative pronoun naḥ (“for us”) being used just
like in RV7.35. Hence, in this sūkta we translate bhadra as auspicious
(or can be taken in the sense of the deity being luck-granting). This
word bhadra is also found in multiple ṛk-s of another famous
vaiśvadeva-sūkta, RV1.89 of Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, in an equivalent sense (ā
no bhadrāḥ; devānām bhadrā sumatir ṛjūyatāṃ; bhadraṃ karṇebhiḥ śṛṇuyāma
devā bhadram paśyemākṣabhir yajatrāḥ). More generally, the pattern of
the repetitions of bhadra is seen on multiple occasions in the RV albeit
not in vaiśvadeva-sūkta-s (e.g. RV8.62 of Pragātha Kāṇva) and also in
the AV saṃhitā-s. A ṛk of Sobhari Kāṇva (RV8.19.19) also uses the word
bhadra repeated in a sense similar to this sūkta:  
bhadro no agnir āhuto bhadrā rātiḥ subhaga bhadro adhvaraḥ | bhadrā uta
praśastayaḥ ||  
For us auspicious Agni when he is made an offering, the auspicious gift,
the auspicious ritual, you the giver of good luck, \[for us\] auspicious
hymns of praise.  
Another comparable word is svasti (“well-being”) used in a similar sense
by the Atri-s in their vaiśvadeva-sūkta, RV5.51.11-15 and also by Gotama
Rāhūgaṇa in RV1.89. Indeed, in the Kashmirian tradition the Bhadrasūkta
is used on conjunction with RV1.89 and RV5.51.11-15. This style
continues into the epic period where we observe Kausalyā confer a
blessing on Rāma using a comparable incantation with svasti ( in R2.25).

The pantheon of the Bhadrasūkta is entirely Vedic with no paurāṇika
features. This squarely places the sūkta within the classic vaidika
tradition and it was perhaps even originally attached to some now lost
saṃhitā. However, in ṛk-2 we encounter the god Prajāpati. He is not
found in the comparable RV7.35 or other core RV vaiśvadeva-sūkta-s. He
appears to have entered the Vedic tradition relatively late from a
para-Vedic tradition \[footnote 2\]. His position in the sūkta suggests
that he has not superseded the old aindra system as it happened in the
even later Vedic layers. In this regard his position is comparable to
that found the camaka-praśna of the Yajurveda tradition. This suggests
that the sūkta indeed belongs to a comparable relative temporal layer
and was a relatively late composition with the Vedic tradition, perhaps
consciously mirroring the RV7.35 and RV1.89. The final ṛk has the
refrain: “tanno mitro varuṇo mā mahantām aditiḥ sindhuḥ pṛthivī uta
dyauḥ” (Mitra and Varuṇa, Aditi, the river, the Earth and also Heaven
should grant this to us), which is characteristic of the Kutsa-s of the
RV (e.g. RV1.94). Kutsa also has a certain predilection for composing
low complexity sūkta-s, which is also seen rather plainly in this one.
Importantly, his two vaiśvadeva-sūkta-s, RV1.105 and RV1.106, have
characteristic low-complexity style with repetition. Notably, his sūkta
to the Sun (RV1.115) uses the word bhadra repeatedly as in this sūkta.
Together, these indicate that the composer of the Bhadrasūkta was a
member of the Kautsa clan.

Some notable features of the Bhadrasūkta are:

1\. Venas is implored to be ever-desirous (uśan…sadā) of the worshiper.
This furnishes a link between Venas and the later name of Venus in
Sanskrit tradition, Uśanas. Thus, it further strengthens the
identification of Venas with Venus and suggests an early IE origin for
this planetary name.

2\. Mātariśvan is explicitly identified with Vāyu in this sūkta. In the
RV Mātariśvan is often mentioned as bringing Agni to the Bhārgava-s and
humans at large (evidently from Vivasvat). In RV3.29.11 Viśvāmitra
clarifies this identification by stating: “mātariśvā yad amimīta mātari
vātasya sargo abhavat sarīmaṇi ||”: \[He is called\] Mātariśvan when he
measures out \[the space\] in his mother; he became the rush of the wind
in flowing out. Thus, we translate Mātariśvan as “he who grows in his
mother” meaning “he who grows in the world-womb.

3\. In ṛk-10 we seen an invocation of various physiological processes.
This is unique for a vaiśvadeva-sūkta and not seen in RV sūkta-s of this
type. In this regard it has a flavor more typical of the AV.

4\. In ṛk-s 12-14 we encounter a great diversity of devatā-dvandva-s,
which is unprecedented in any other vaiśvadeva-sūkta elsewhere in the
śruti.

The emended text of the sūkta is presented below with an approximate
translation.
