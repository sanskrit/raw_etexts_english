CHAPTER XIX 

DEVAYAJNA 

Devayajfla :— As stated in the Tai. Ar. quoted above ( p. 696 ) 
the Devayajfia was performed by offering fuel sticks into fire. 
According to the Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 13. 1, Baud. »" Dh. S. II. 6. 4 
and Gaut. V. 8-9, the Devayajfia consisted in offering into fire 
offerings ( of food or at least a fuel stick ) with * svaha ' uttered 
after the name of the deities in the dative case. Manu also 
( III. 70 ) looks upon homa as devayajfia. The devatas to whom 
homa or devayajfia was offered are different according to different 
grhya or dharma sutras. For example, Asv. gr. ( I. 2. 2 ) says 
that ' they are the deities of the Agnihotra ( i. e. Surya or Agni, 
and Prajapati ), Soma Vanaspati, Agni and Soma, Indra and 
Agni, Heaven and earth, Dhanvantari, Indra, the Visve Devas, 
Brahman *. According to Gaut. they are Agni, Dhanvantari, 
Visve Devas, Prajapati, Agni Svistakrt. Vide Manava-grhya 
II. 12. % where the deities are different from those in Asv. gr. and 
Gaut. In later smrtis a distinction is made between homa ( or 
devayajfia ) and devapujS. Yaj. in 1. 100 speaks of the worship 
of gods immediately after tarpana and then in I. 102 includes 
homa among the five yajfias. Manu II. 176 also makes this 
distinction. Medieval writers came to look upon Vaisvadeva 
as the devayajfia, while others held that homa to gods was 
different from Vaisvadeva. Vide Haradatta U8S on Ap. Dh. 8. 
L 4. 13. 1. According to Marlci and Harlta quoted in the 
Smrtimuktaphala ( Shnika p. 383 ) devapuja is performed after 
the morning homa or after brahmayajfia and tarpana IM7 in the 
noon. In medieval and modern times the anoient idea of homa

receded far into the back-ground and its place was taken by an 
elaborated procedure of devapuja ( worship of images kept in the 
house ). Some space must be devoted to the origin and develop- 
ment of this phase of religious practice. 

It is extremely doubtful whether images were generally 
worshipped in the anoient Vedic times. In the Rgveda and the 
other Vedas, there is worship of Agni, the Sun, Varuna and 
various other deities; but they were worshipped in the 
abstract, as powers and manifestations of the one Divine Person 
or as separate deities or funotions behind natural phenomena or 
cosmic processes. There are no doubt passages where the 
deities of the Egveda are spoken of as possessed of bodily 
attributes. A few verses may be cited in this connection. 
Indra is described in Eg. VIII. 17. 8 as ' tuvigrlva ' (with a 
powerful or thick neck ) and ' vapodara ' ( having big or 
capaoious belly) and 'subahu' (having well-shaped arms). 
Eg. VIIL 17. 5 speaks of the limbs and sides of Indra and prays 
Indra to taste honey with his tongue. In Eg. X. 96. 8 Indra is 
spoken as having dark green ( hari ) hair and beard and in X. 
105.7 again it is said that the hair on his chin are dark-green 
and his chin is never injured ( in battle ). ,M8 In Eg. II. 33. 5 
Eudra is said to be ' rdudara ' ( whose abdomen is soft ), 
' babhru ' ( of brown colour ) and ' susipra ' ( with a fine chin or 
nose ). The V&j. S. 16. 7 speaks of Rudra as having a dark-blue 
throat and red ( complexion ) and 16. 51 says he wears a skin 
( krtti ). In Eg. 1. 155. 6 Visnu is said to approach a battle 
with his huge body and as a youth ( * brhac-charlra * and 
'yuva'). In Eg. IIL 53. 6 Indra is asked to go home at once 
after drinking Somas, as he has a charming wife and delightful 
house. In Eg. X 26.7 god Fusan is said to shake his beard. In 
Eg. IV. 53.2 Savitr is said to put on a yellowish drapi ( armour ) 
and in Eg. I. 25. 13 Varuna is said to wear a golden drapi. It 
is not necessary to multiply examples. It is possible to argue 
that all these descriptions are poetic and metaphoric. But there 
are two passages of the Egveda that cause much more difficulty 
than the above. Eg. IV. 24. 10 asks * who will " M purchase this

my Indra for ten cows and might return it after he ( Indra ) has 
killed enemies ' ? Rg. VIII. 1.5 says 'O Indra! I shall not 
give thee for even a great price, not even for a hundred, a thou- 
sand or an aynta ( ten thousand ) '. It may be argued that here 
there is a reference to an image of Indra. But this is not con- 
vincing. It is equally possible to hold that these are hyperbolic 
or boastful statements of the great devotion of the worshipper to 
Indra and that there is no reference to an image of Indra. If 
we look at the Vedio cult described in the Br&hraanas where sacri- 
fices of butter, cakes and boiled rioe or other grain are offered 
to several deities in the fire, or animal and soma sacrifices 
are described at great length, it is clear that the ancient sages 
hardly ever thought of the worship of idols, but of deities in the 
abstract to whom they ascribed different functions and poetically 
represented them as being endowed like human beings with 
hands and feet and other limbs. It cannot be denied that here 
and there occur a few passages that suggest images as objects of 
worship. For example, in the Tai. Br. II. 6. 17 occurs the 
passage ' may the hotr priest worship the three goddesses, that are 
golden, that are endowed with beauty ( or ornaments ) that are 
great ones' &o. It looks as if golden images of the three goddesses 
are meant."* One can say without much fear of contradiction 
that the religious practices among the higher strata of the Vedio 
Aryans did not include the worship of images in the house or 
in temples. But we have hardly any literary materials for judg- 
ing what the religious practices of the lower or ignorant masses 
of Vedic India were. In Rg. VII. 21. 5 Vasistha prays to Indra 
' may the iiina-devaa not overwhelm our rta ' ( religious order or 
practices); similarly in Rg. X. 99. 3 the prayer is 'may he 
( Indra ) striking ( or killing ) the sisnadevas overcome them by 
his form or power '. Scholars are sharply divided in opinion 
about the meaning of the word ,MI ' sisnadeva '. Some hold that 
it denotes people who were worshippers of the phallus ( vide 
Vedio Index, vol. II. p. 332 ). Others hold that the word is 
used in a secondary or metaphorioal sense for those who are 
immersed in sexual gratification and do not recognize anything 
else (as worthy of pursuit ). Yaska in his Nirukta (IV. 19) quotes

Bg. VII. 21. 5 and explains that the word means 'those who do 
not observe rules of brahmacarya (celibacy)'. The preponderance 
of authority and evidence is in favour of the seoond view. In 
Bg. VII. 104. 14( = Atharva VIII. 4. 14), the poet pleads * if I be 
addicted to falsehood, O fire, or if I call upon the gods 
in vain (then you may injure me), but (not being so) why 
are you angry with me? May those whose speech is false 
incur slaughter at your hands'. Here 'anrta-devah' is practi- 
cally the same as 'drogha-vacah' in the fourth pada. In the 
Tai. Up. 1. 11. 2 we have the words ' matrdevo bhava, pitrdevo 
bhava ', where all that is meant is that ' one should be devoted 
to the parents'. Therefore 'sisna-deva' could hardly mean 
' those who worship phallus as god*. In Bg. mt X. 87. 2 Agni 
is invoked as follows ' with thy tongue reach the muradevas, in 
thy mouth envelope the eaters of raw flesh after cutting 
them into bits ' and in Bg. VII. 104. 24 Indra is called upon to 
kill male and female yatudhanas ( evil spirits or sorcerers ) and 
it is added ' may the muradevas perish bereft of their necks and 
may they not see the sun rising up from the horizon '. Yaska 
in commenting on Bg. X. 4. 4 explains 'mura' as 'mudha' 
( stupid ) 1,M . It is possible to take ' mura ' as meaning ' mortal • 
or ' perishable ' (since the root 'mr' assumes the form ' murlya' 
as in Bg. VII. 104. 15 ). From the above quotations it is clear 
that the Bgvedic poets knew of low people who practised 
witchcraft, who were muradevas ( i. e. either worshipped peri- 
shable objects or were stupid in their cult) and who were the 
enemies of the Aryans. There are also clear references to 
enemies who did not look upon Indra as God ( Bg. X. 27. 6, 
X48. 7, X.86. 1). 

Phallic emblems have been found in the ancient ruins at 
Mohenjo-daro (vide Sir John Marshall's work, vol. I. pp. 58-63 ). 
Except these finds the earliest known lifigas so far discovered do 
not go beyond the first century 6. 0. But centuries before 
Christ the worship of images had become widespread in India.

Isana, bis consort and bis son ' Jayanta ' ( the conqueror Skanda) 
are described, images of these three are worshipped. The Manava- 
grhya nH II. 15. 6 prescribes that if an image ( of wood, stone 
or metal ) were to be burnt down or to become reduced to powder 
(of itself) or falls (from its pedestal) or breaks into pieoes, or 
laughs, ormoves to anotberplace, the householder (in whose house 
it had been established ) should offer ten oblations into fire with 
certain Vedio verses. In the Baud. gr. II. 2. 13 when describing 
the ceremony of TJpaniskramana ( taking the infant ohild out 
of the house for the first time ) it is said that the father after 
performing homa goes out of the house, worships the images 
outside ( the house ), feeds the brahmanas, makes them 
pronounce benedictions and then brings back to the house the 
infant. "* s The Laugaksi grhya ( 18. 3 ) speaks of devatay atana 
( a temple ). Gaut. ( IX. 13-14 ) forbids a man from answering 
calls of nature in front of images or from stretching one's feet 
towards them and ( IX. 66 ) requires a man to circumambulate 
a temple ( devatayafcana ) that he may meet on his way. The 
San. gr. IV. 12. 15 does the same and uses the same word ( 8. B. 
E. vol. 29, p. 125 ) and in II. 6. 6 mentions a deva-kula ( god's 
house ). S.p. Dh. S. ( I. 11. 30. 28 ) has a similar rule. Manu 
( II. 176 ) directs the brahmacarin to worship images, requires a 
person to oircumambulate images that he may meet with when 
on a journey ( IV. 39 ), not to cross the shadow of images 
( IV. 130 ) and ordains that witnesses be sworn in the presence 
of the images of gods and brahmanas ( VIII. 87 ). Vide also 
Manu III. 117 and IX. 285. The Visnu Dh. S. ( 23. 34, 63. 27 ) 
mentions the images of gods ( devatSrcS ) and speaks of the 
worship of Bhagavat Vasudeva as an image. In Vasistha 
XL 31, Visnu Dh. S. 69. 7, 30. 15, 70 13, 91. 10 the word ' deva- 
tfiyatana ' or ' devayatana ' occurs. Unfortunately the dates of 
all these works are far from being certain. But no soholar will 
assign the Manava, Baudhayana and Saiikhyayana grhyasutras 
and the dharmasutras of Gautama and Apastamba to a later 
date than the 5th or 4th century B. C. Panini, whom no scholar 
will place later than 300 B. O. ( though there are some who

place him several centuries earlier ), teaches "'• that an image 
by attending on whioh a person maintains himself and which 
is not for sale has the same name as the god whose image it is 
e. g. an image is called Siva or Skanda when the worshipper 
makes his livelihood by attending on the image of Siva or 
Skanda (and appropriating the offerings placed before the image) 
which is not for sale. Pfinlni also teaches ( IV. 3. 98 ) that 
' Vfisudevaka ' is a person who is a votary of Vasudeva and 
Patanjali expressly says that Vasudeva was not a mere ksatriya, 
but that the word is the name of God. Patafijali comments on 
the former sutra and vouchsafes the very interesting information 
that the Mauryas who were greedy of gold established or 
manufactured images, to which this rule would not apply, but it 
would apply to the images of gods that were in Pafcanjali's day 
used for puja ( worship ). According to Patanjali the images 
manufactured by the Mauryas would be called Sivaka &c. 
Patanjali, while commenting on PSnini IV. 1. 54, gives as 
examples an image with a long or high nose. The Adiparva 
70. 49, Anusasana 10. 20-21, Asvamedhika 70. 16 speak of 
devat&yatanas ( temples ) and Bhlsma 112. 11 in speaking of 
terrible portents refers to images in temples trembling and 
shedding tears. Kharavela, king of Kalinga ( latter half of 
2nd century B. O. ) is said to have re-established an image of 
Jina carried away by Nandaraja and he is described as ' sarva- 
devayatana-sankhara-kSraka ' ( one who looked after the preser- 
vation and repair of all temples ). In Eau^ilya's Arthasastra 
II. 4 ( variously assigned to different dates from 300 B. C. to 
250 A D. ) it is stated that in the centre of the capital shrines 
of AparSjita, Apratihata, Jayanta, Vaijayanta and temples of 
Siva, Asvins, Vaisravana, LaksmI and of Madira ( wine ? ) 
should be erected. It follows from the above discussion that 
long before P&nini there had arisen professional men who made 
their livelihood by attending on images and that temples of 
deities must have existed even in the 4th or 5th century B. C. 

The question whether the worship of images and the erec- 
tion of temples spontaneously arose among the Vedio Aryans

Ch. XIX ] Bevayajfla-Origin of image worship 711 

or whether they derived the idea from some other race or 
sectarians has been very often discussed. There are three 
principal views, viz. (I) that the worship of images was derived 
from sudras and Dravidian tribes and absorbed in the brahma- 
nical cult ; (2) that the making of images was copied from the 
Buddhists; (3) that this practice was a natural and spontaneous 
growth. The second view is not very plausible. Images of 
Buddha were not made for a long time after his nirvava. He 
was only represented at first by symbols. If modern chrono- 
logy about Buddha's ministry is to be followed 1697 (he was 
born about 563 B. C. and died about 483 B. C. ), it is almost 
impossible to hold that images of gods originally came to be 
made in imitation of images or statues of Buddha, since, as we 
saw above, temples and images of gods had already become 
widespread throughout India in the 4th or 5th century B. 0. ,69e 
The first view is supported with arguments of some weight by 
Dr. Farquhar in J. R. A. S. for 1928 pp. 15-23. Fide also 
Dr. Charpentier in Indian Antiquary for 1927 pp. 89 ff. and 
130 ff. But I do not hold that the reasons for this view are con- 
vincing. There is no apparent reason why only about 400 B. G. 
image worship should have been copied from the sudras by the 
brahmanas. The sudra though given an inferior status had be- 
come a part of Indian Society at least a thousand years before 
400 B. C, as the Purusasukta shows. He had been serving the 
brahmanas for centuries before that date and brahmanas 
could in the times of the sutras partake of food cooked by him 
and could take sudra women in marriage. So, if the worship 
of images was a practice borrowed from the sudras, it should 
have prevailed at least a thousand years before 400 B. C. The 
fact that the devalaka brahmana (one who maintained himself 
by attending on images either for a salary or by appropriating 
what was placed before the image ) was not to be invited at a 
sraddha and had thus an inferior status ( Manu III. 152 ) is to 
be explained in a different way. The institution of worshippers 
of images had not an hoary antiquity behind it in the time of 



1697. See 'History of Buddhist thought' by Dr. E. J. Thomas (1933) 
for these dates. 

1698. Vide Mr. 0. C. Ganguly's paper 'the antiquity of the 
Buddha Image ' in Ostasiatische Zeitsohrift Noue Folge XIV, Heft 2/3, 
where he adduces rery weighty grounds for holding that the beginning 
of the cult of the worship of the image of Buddha lies somewhere 
between 150 B. C. to 50 B. C.

Menu, as that of priests officiating at th» srauta or grhya 
sacrifices had in his day ; besides such men must have neg- 
lected the principal duty of a brahmana ( viz. study of the 
Veda ) and so they were looked down upon. Even in the times 
of the Brahmanas the simple grhya sacrifices were being raised 
to the level of srauta rites, which were gradually becoming less 
and less frequent. The Ait. Br. (11. 8) prescribes that when a 
man takes up an offering to a deity and is about to say ' vasat ' 
he should contemplate upon that deity for whom the offering is 
meant."" This would naturally lead the worshipper to invest 
the deity with anthropomorphic attributes. The Nirukta devotes 
some space ( VII. 6-7 ) to the consideration of the question of the 
form of the deities referred to in the Vedio mantras" 00 Three 
views are propounded, viz. (1) they have an anthropomorphic 
form, (2) they have no anthromorphio form, (3) they may par- 
take of both characters, i. e. the deities though really non- 
anthropomorphio may assume various forms for carrying out 
some purpose or activity. This last view contains the doctrine 
of avataras. When Vedio sacrifices became less and less preva- 
lent owing to various causes (particularly because of the 
doctrine of ahithsa, the various upasanas and the philosophy of 
the Absolute set forth in the Upaniaads ), there arose the cult of 
the worship of images. Originally, it was not so universal or 
elaborate as it became in medieval and modern times. 

The literature on the subject of image-worship is vast. The 
principal topics are: the substances from which images are 
made, the prinoipal deities of which images ?were or are 
worshipped, the proportions of the various limbs in manufactur- 
ing images, the consecration of images and temples, the ritual 
of image worship. The subject of consecration of images and 
temples will be dealt with later on under the topio of Pratistha. 

In the Brhat-samhita of Varahamihira (chap. 58, where 
images of Rama, of Visnu with eight or four or two arms, of 
Baladeva, Ekanamsa, Samba, Brahma, Skanda, Siva, Girija as 
half of Siva's body, Buddha, Jina, the Sun, the Matrs, Yama, 
Varuna, Eubera are described); in the Matsyapurana chap.

Puja-prakasa devote considerable space to the subjeot of deva- 
puja ( image-worship ) in its various aspects, the last work 
containing 382 pages in print on this subject. A very conoise

714 History of Dharmaidstra I Oh. XIX 

The word ' devapQja ' ""' occurs in the Vartika on Panini 
1. 3, 25. The digests try to show that, just as yUga ( saorifice ) 
consists in giving up materials accompanied by a mantra with 
reference to a deity that is then principally in view, so puja 
also is yUga, as therein also there is giving up ( or dedication ) 
of materials to a deity. ,m 

The next question is ; who are entitled to perform devapuja. 
Men and women of all varnas and even the untouchables were 
to worship Visnu who incarnated himself as man-lion, accord- 
ing to the Nrsirhhapurana and Vrddha-Hatlta ,7 °* (VI. 6 and 
256 ). All the male members of a joint undivided family are to 
perform separately samdhya, brahmayajna and agnihotra (if 
they have consecrated the srauta and grhya fires ) but devapuja 
and vaisvadeva will be only one for the whole family. im Th e 
time for devapuja is after tarpana at noon and before vaisva- 
deva ; but some place it after vaisvadeva. According to Daksa 
II. 30-31 all devakarya ( duties and ceremonies in honour of 
gods ) must be performed in the first half of the day. 

One of the peculiar tenets of Hinduism is adJukara-bheda 
( difference in rights, duties, ceremonies and worship dependent 
on difference in intellectual, emotional and spiritual equipment). 
Not every one was capable of the same discipline and regimen. 
Image worship was not absolutely necessary for everybody and 
the ancient writers never thought that when they worshipped 
an image they were simply paying homage to a material object. 
They believed that they contemplated the One Supreme Spirit in 
the form of the image or symbol before them, which helped ordi- 
nary people to concentrate their mind on the Godhead to the 
exclusion of other external and engrossing objects and pursuits.

Oh. XIX ] Devayajfta- Image worship 715 

Acoording ,7 °* to Narada, the BhSgavata-purana XL 27. 9 and 
Vrddha-Harlta ( VI. 128-129 ) Hari is to be worshipped in 
water, in fire, in the heart, in the sun, on the altar, in brahmanas 
and in images. Satatapa 1707 says 'the gods of ordinary men 
are in water, those of the knowing are in heaven, of the ignorant 
and of those of small intelligence are in wood and clay ( i. e» 
images ) and of the yogin in his own self ( or heart )'. God is 
worshipped in fire by throwing oblations, in water by throwing 
flowers, in the heart by contemplation and in the orb of the sun 
by japa. 

The materials out of which images are to be made are 
precious stones, gold, silver, copper, brass, iron, stone, wood or 
clay. One made of precious stones was the best and the most 
inferior was that made of clay. The Bhagavata-purana ( XI, 
27. 12 ) says that images are eight-fold viz. made of stone, wood 
iron, sandal-wood or similar paste, drawn ( as a picture ), made 
of sand, of precious stones and lastly mental ,70s . The Matsya- 
purana ( 258. 20-21 ) adds ' lead and bronze * to the above eight 
of the Skanda. Vide also Vrddha-Harlta VIII. 120. Among 
stones the Salagrama stone (a black stone containing fossil 
ammonite found in the Gandakl river near a village called 
Salagrama ) and the stone from Dvaraka marked with a cakra 
(discus) are highly prized in the worship of Visnu. Vrddha-Harlta 
(VIII. 183-189) highly extols Salagrama-puja. It is stated by 
Vrddha-Harlta that only dvijas can worship Salagrama and not 
sudras. According to several purana passages quoted in the 
Pujaprakasa (pp. 20-21 ) even women and sQdras can perform

the worship of S&lagrSma 1TM , hut they should not touch it. 
Similarly they are not to worship lingas established in the past 
by sages &c. This worship of Salagrama is comparatively 
ancient. Samkaracarya in his commentary on the Vedantasutra 
speaks in several places of Salagrama l7 '° being worshipped 
as a symbol of Hari. Five kinds of stones were used in 
worship, viz. Bana-lingas from Narmada in Siva worship. 
Salagrama in Visnu worship, metallic stone in Durga 
worship, crystal for sun-worship and red stone in Ganesa 
worship. The Eajataranginl ( II. 131 and VII. 185 ) refers 
to the establishment of BSnalihgas 1VU of Siva in Kashmir 
taken from the Narmada, About the images to be worshipped 
in the house it is stated in the Matsyapurana ( 258. 22 ) that 
they should be in size as big as a part of the thumb up to 12 
angulas and not more ; but an image to be established in a 
temple should be up to sixteen aiigulas and not more or its 
proper height should be arrived at as follows : divide the height 
of the door into eight parts ; taking seven parts divide them into 
one-third and two-thirds ; the pedestal of the image should be 
one-third and the image should be two-thirds of the seven parts 
( i. e. # of seven-eighths of the height of the door ). Vide 
Matsyapur&na 258. 23-25. 

Among the gods popularly worshipped the principal ones 
are Visnu under various names and in various avataras, Siva 
in his various forms, Durga, Ganesa and the Sun. ,m The

In medieval and modern times Visnu has been deemed to 
have descended to earth ten times to preserve the world and its 
culture. A brief account of the development of this theory 
will not be out of place here. The ten well-known awt&ras are 
Matsya ( fish ), Kurma ( tortoise ), Varsha ( boar ), Narasirhha 
(man-lion), Vamana (dwarf), Parasurama, Rama, Krsna, Buddha 
and Kalkin. There are faint glimmerings of the theory of 
avataras and of these forms even in the earliest Vedio Literature. 
In Rg. VIII. 17. 13" IS it is said that Indra was the grandson of 
the sage Srcgavrsa. This may be interpreted as meaning that 
Indra was supposed to have descended on the earth in a 
human form. In Rg. IV. 26. 1 the sage Vamadeva exclaims 1714 
' I was Manu and I was also the Sun '. This is referred to in 
the Br. Up. I. 4. 10 and is often relied upon in support of the 
doctrine of the transmigration of souls. It may be capable of 
that interpretation, but if that is not accepted it will at least tend 
to support the proposition that the Vedic sage thought that the

Sun could be born on the earth aa a human being (i. e. there was 
an avatara of the Sun ). There is another sense in which this 
passage of the Rg and that of the Br. Up. are understood in the 
Vedantasutra I. 1. 30 viz. that Vamadeva had realized that his 
soul was non-different from the Supreme Soul, Brahma. The 
elements of the avatara of Matsya are probably suggested by 
the story of Manu who was saved from a flood by a great 
horned fish to whose horn Manu tied the rope of his ship when 
the flood rose. Vide Sat. Br. I. 8. 1. 1-6 ( S. B. E. vol. 12, 
pp. 216-218 )." 15 

The tortoise avatara was probably suggested by the legend 
that PrajSpati having assumed the form of a tortoise created 
living beings and that as the words Jcurma ( tortoise ) and 
kaiyapa mean the same object all creatures are said to be 
descended from ( or to belong to ) Kasyapa ( Sat. Br. VII. 5. 1. 
5, S. B. E. vol. 41, p. 390 )."" The peculiar exploit of the Boar 
incarnation, viz. raising up the earth from the bottom of the 
ocean, is alluded to in the 6at. Br. XIV. 1. 2. 11 ( S. B. E. 
vol. 44, p. 451 ) ' a boar called Emusa raised the earth up and 
he was her lord PrajSpati. ,im In the $g. Visnu is said to 
have pierced Varaha ( I. 61. 7 ) and that he being incited by 
Indra brings to the worshipper a hundred buffaloes, rice cooked 
in milk, and the boar ( called ) Emusa ( VIII. 77. 10 ). The Tai. 
5.r. X 1 refers to this myth. In the Kanaka S. VIII. 2 
PrajSpati is said to have become a boar and plunged in water. 
Vide also Tai. S. VII. 1. 5. 1 and Tai. Br. I. 1. 3. Some 
elements of the story of the destruction of Hiranyakasipu 
by Visnu in the man-lion form are supplied by the story of the 
slaughter of the demon Namuci by Indra at dawn with the 
foam of waters, since Indra had agreed with Namuci that ' he 
would not slay him by day or by night, with the dry or moist

or with the palm or with the fist, or with staff or bow &o.' 
(Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3. 1-4, S. B. E. vol. 44, pp. 222-223 ). Sat. 
Br. XII. 7. 3. 4 quotes Rg. VIII. 14. 13 which narrates that 
Indra out off the head of Namuoi with the foam of waters. 1718 
In the anoient Tamil work Silappadikaram (translated by 
Prof. V. B. Diksitar ) there is a reference to the Narasimha 
avatara. The special achievement of the dwarf incarnation, 
viz. the request of the dwarf for as much spaoe as would be 
covered by his three steps, has its counter-part in the Bgveda, 
where the principal exploits of Visnu are the taking of three steps 
and making the earth steady or fast." 19 Vide Sat. Br. I. 2. 5. 1 
for the Dwarf incarnation. In the ChSndogya Up. III. 17. 6 it 
is stated that the sage Ghora Angirasa imparted a certain 
instruction to Krsna, the son of Devakl. 1 ™ This may have 
supplied some part of the legends about Krsna in thu Great 
Epio and the Purfinas. 

We saw above that according to Patanjali Vasudeva was 
not a mere ksatriya but an incarnation of God. Patanjali 
quotes a quarter of a verse which speaks of Kamsa being killed 
by Vasudeva and refers to painted shows wherein the party 
of Vasudeva were dressed in blaok and of Kamsa in red ( vide 
Mahabhasya, vol. II. p. 36 and p. 119 ). Patafljali also speaks 
of Ugrasena as a member of the Andhaka clan and Visvaksent 
as a Vrani and of Baladeva also ( Mahabhasya, vol. II. p. 257 
on Panini IV. 1. 114 ) and of Satyabhama ( vol. I. p. Ill ) and 
Akrura ( vol. II. p. 295 ). So the main story of Krsna and 
persons connected with his ministry on earth as gathered from 
the Mahabharata, the Harivamsa &c. were known to Patanjali 
and to some extent also to Panini. The Besnagara Inscription 
of Heliodorus ( E. I. vol. X. Appendix p. 63 No. 669 ) shows 
that even Greeks became devotees of Visnu. The Eran Stone

Inscription ( vide Gupta Inscriptions p. 158 No. 36 ) refers to 
the Boar Incarnation. The BhSgavatapurSna II. 4. 18 declares 
that even KirStas, Hunas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pukkasas, Abhlras, 
Suhmas, Yavanas, Khasas and others and oven Binners, when 
they throw themselves on the mercy of Visnu as devotees, are 
purified. It may therefore be assumed that the theory of the 
avataras of Visnu ( whether ten or less or more ) had been 
prevalent some centuries before the Christian era. 

In the Mahabharata and the RamSyana it is frequently 
stated that Qod comes down to earth often for punishing the 
wioked, for the protection of the good and the establish' 
ment of dharma. mi In the Santiparva ( 339. 103-104 ) the 
avataras are stated to be ten and they are the same as now 
acoepfced except that Haihsa is mentioned instead of Buddha 
and Krsna is called Satvata. Among the Purapas also several 
do not mention Buddha as an avatara. The M&rkandeya ( 47. 7 ) 
speaks of Matsya, Kurma and Varaha incarnations and in 4* 
53-56 begins with Varaha and mentions Nrsimha, Vamana and 
Mathura ( i. e. Krsna ). The Matsya ( 47. 39-45 ) speaks of 
12 avatSras, some of which are different from the usual ones 
and verse 106 states that Bhrgu cursed Visnu to be born as a 
human being seven times, as he killed a woman, viz. his wife* 
The Matsya-purSna ( chap. 285. 6-7 ) mentions the well-known 
ten avataras inoluding Buddha and this passage is quoted by 
Apar&rka on p. 338. The Matsya-purana 47. 247 speaks of 
Buddha as the 9th ( avatara ). The Nrsirhha-purana chap. 36. 
the Agni-purfina chap. 2 to 16 and the Varaha-purana 4. 2 
enumerate the well-known ten avataras. The Vrddha-Harlta 
smrti 179 * ( X. 145-146 ) enumerates ten avataras, includes 
Hayagrlva in them (in place of Buddha) and expressly says that 
Buddha should not be worshipped. In the Ramayana (AyodhyS-

passage may be an interpolation. In the Bhagavatapurana 
there are three different lists of avataras at I. 3 ( where 22 
avataras occur in which Buddha, Kalkin, Vyasa, Balarama 
and Krena are separately enumerated ), II. 7 ( where besides 
the well-known avataras, Eapila, Dattatreya and others are 
mentioned ), and at VI. 8 Buddha and Kalkin are both 
mentioned in verse 17. m * The Krtyaratnakara ( pp. 159-160 ) 
quotes a passage from the Brahmapurana about a vrata on the 
7th of the bright half of Vaisakha where it is stated that Vi?nu 
as Buddha started the Sakyadharma and that on the 7th day of 
Vaisakha when the moon is in conjunction with the Pusya 
constellation, the image of Buddha should be bathed to the 
accompaniment of sayings of the Sakya and gifts of garments 
should be made to Sakya ascetics. The same work (pp. 247-248) 
quotes a pasBage of the Varahapurana on the observances of 
Buddha-dvadasI, when a golden image of Buddha was to be 
worshipped and given to a brahmana. In memoir No. 26 of the 
Archaeological Survey of India, it is stated ( p. 5 ) that in an 
inscription from South India of about the 7th oentury A. D. 
ooours a verse in a mutilated form in whioh Buddha is enume- 
rated among the ten avataras ( ...narasimhotha Vamanah Ramo 
Ramasca Krsnasca Buddhah Kalkl ca te dasa ). 1725 From the 
above discussion it follows that Buddha became in popular view 
an avatara of Visnu for the Hindus from about the 7th oentury 
A. D. Even about that time he was not universally so treated 
and orthodox writers like Kumarila ( who flourished somewhere 
about 650 to 750 A. D. ) did not admit that he was an avatara. 
In his TantravSrtika ( p. 195 on Jaimini I. 3. 4 ) Kumarilabhatfa 
says that the Sakya texts were promulgated by Buddha and 
others that had strayed from the path of the three Vedas and

that aoted contrary to the Vedas and asks I7M the question " what 
assurance is there that one, who, himself being a kqatriya, trans- 
gressed the dharma laid down for ksatriyas and betook himself 
to the profession of a religious teacher and accepted gifts, would 
impart instruction in dharma that would not lead to confusion? 
It has been said ' one should leave at a distance a person who 
does acts contrary to the other world. How can one who 
deceives himself confer benefit on another ' " ? The Brhatsarhhita 
of Varahamihira ( 60. 19 ) states the persons who are to hold 
the office of worshipper in the temples of several deities, viz. 
the Bhagavatas for Visnu, the Magas ( sakadvlplya brahmanas ) 
in temples of the Bun, dvijas smeared with ashes in Siva temples, 
those who know the group of raStrs in the temples of the Mother 
Goddesses, brahmanas in the temples of Brahma, Buddhists in 
the temples of Buddha who was good to all and whose mind 
was full of peace, naked ascetics in the temples of Jinas ; who- 
ever is a devotee of a particular god should worship that god 
according to the procedure prescribed in his own cult. 1727

Ksemendra ( about 1066 A. D. ) in his Dasavatara-carita and the 
Gltagovinda of Jayadeva ( about 1180-1200 A. D. ) speak of 
Buddha as an avatSra of Visnu. Therefore at least before or about 
the 10th century A. D. Buddha had come to be looked upon as an 
avatSra of Visnu throughout India. 1 ™ The total disappearance 
of Buddhism from India, the land of its birth, is a most striking 
phenomenon, which as stated by A. Schweitzer in ' Indian 
thought and its development ' ( tr. by Mrs. O. E. B. Russell, 
1935 ) p. 137, cannot be satisfactorily explained. Though 
Buddha did not accept the authority of the Vedas and of 
brahmanas, nor the existence of an individual soul nor the 
Supreme Soul, he believed in karma and punarjanma and in release 
from sar'nsara by renunciation and desirelessness. When his 
followers deified Buddha, when animal sacrifices had been almost 
stopped and his insistence on universal charity and kindliness 
and on self-restraint were universally accepted by the followers 
of the Yedic religion, Buddha came to be deemed an avatSra of 
Visnu, as the raison d'etre for a separate cult oeased and the 
decadence of morals among monks and nuns hastened the 
downfall of Buddhism, the finishing touohes being 'added by 
the Moslem invasions from about 1200 A. D. No one can affirm 
that persecution had anything to do with the disappearance of 
Buddhism from India. Though it cannot be said that there was 
no religious persecution whatever at any time in India, the 
evidenoe for persecution is very limited and such persecution if 
any as may have existed was as nothing compared to the perse- 
cution of Christians by other Christians and of Jews in all cen- 
turies and particularly in the 20th oentury by several so-called 
Christian powers. The few well-authenticated cases of large-scale 
persecutions are those of Sasanka who persecuted the Buddhists 
(vide Beal's •Records of the eastern world,' vol. I p. 212, vol. II. 
p. 42, 91, 118, 121), of Mihirakula, of a Pandya king (in the 11th

century ) who persecuted the Jainas. From Asoka downwards, 
kings and the civil power always extended a generous tolerance 
to all sects ( vide Asoka's Rock Edict No. 12 ). The father of 
the great emperor Harsa was a worshipper of the Sun, while 
Harsa's elder brother Rajyavardhana was a Buddhist and 
Harsa, though himself a Saiva, speaks of his brother with 
greater reverence than of his own father ( vide the Madhuban 
copperplate inscription in E. I. vol. VII p. 155 and I p. 67 ). 
Vide Barth's 'Religions of India* pp. 133-134, Farquhar's 
'Outlines of the Religious Literature of India' pp. 169, 175 for 
general religious tolerance in ancient India. 

Rama and Rrena were worshipped as avataras of Visnu at 
least several centuries before Christ. KalidSsa in the Raghu- 
varhsa ( XI. 22 ) and the Meghaduta indioates that he regarded 
Vamana as an avatara of Visnu as muoh as Rama was. Simi- 
larly the Varaha and Narasimha avataras are frequently spoken 
of in the Kadambarl. The Trimurti i. e. the conception of the 
triune combination of Brahma, Visnu and $iva into one God- 
head is also an ancient one. The Mahabharata ( Vanaparva ) 
gives expression to the idea that Prajapati creates the world in 
the form of Brahma, sustains it in the form of the great 
Purusa and annihilates it in the form of Rudra. Hopkins in 
his 'Epic Mythology* p. 231 holds that this is a solitary 
passage about Trimurti and is a late one and that the 
Mahabharata in general has no doctrine of Trimurti, but rather 
of the equality of Visnu and Siva. Kalidasa in his Raghuvarhsa 
(X. 16) and Kumarasambhava (II. 4)'™' breathes the same belief. 
The temples of Brahma are now very few and far between, the 
most well-known being that at Puskara ( Aimer). There is a 
temple of Brahma in the Idar State and another at Sadhi in the 
Padra Taluka of the Baroda State. The PadmapurSna ( Sratf- 
khanda 17 ) shows that the worship of Brahma had declined at 
that time owing, it is said, to the curse of Savitri. 

Siva worship appears to be the most ancient worship that 
is still prevalent. Sir John Marshall's work on Mohenjo-daro 
( vol. I. pp. 52-53 and plate XII No. 17 ) shows a figure that is 
most probably of Siva as a great yogin surrounded by the

elephant, the tiger, the rhinoceros and the buffalo ( as Siva is 
oalled Pasupati ). Vide also the Preface to vol. I. p. VI L At 
Mohenjo-daro the humped and short-horned bull is among the 
most prominent objects. Siva as half male and half female was 
worshipped long before Kalidasa (vide first verse of the Malavi- 
kagnimitra and Kumarasambhava VII. 28). Siva is often 
spoken of as Pancatunda ( with five faces ), the five aspects 
being respectively oalled Sadyojata, Vamadeva, Aghora, Tat- 
purusa and Isana ( vide Tai. Ar. X. 43-47, Visnudharmottara 
III. 48. 1 ). Though in later times the followers of Siva and 
Visnu abused each other, the Mahabharata and some of the 
Puranas exhibit a most tolerant spirit and say there is no 
difference between the two. 1780 Vide Vanaparva 39. 76 and 189. 
5-6, Santi 343. 132, Matsyapurana 52. 23. The 1000 names of 
Visnu are enumerated in Anusasanaparva 149. 14-120 and the 
1000 names of Siva in Anusasana 17 and Santi 285. 74 ff. 

About the images of the sun the Matsyapurana (11. 31 and 
33 ) enjoins that in painting pictures of the sun or in temples of 
the sun the feet of the sun are not to be drawn mi or shown. 

About Ganesa a few words have already been said 
( at pp. 213-216 ). Ganesa came to be worshipped even by the 
Jainas. Vide Acara-dinakara ( composed in saihvat 1468 ) 
published in the Kharataragaooha-granthamala ( part II, 1923 ), 
where on p. 210 there is the procedure of consecrating an image 
of Ganesa even for Jainas and 'Journal of Indian History', 
vol. 18 for 1939 p. 158 for different types of Ganesa figures one 
of which has 18 arms. For a figure of Ganesa with sweetmeats 
( of about 500 A. D. ) vide ' Ancient India ' by Oodrington ( Plate 
XXXIX). The Acaradinakara says that images of Ganesa 
may have two, four, six, nine, 18 or 108 arms. The Agnipurana 
chap. 71, the Mudgalapurana and Ganesapur&na deal with 
Ganesa worship, but their dates are uncertain. The Varaha- 
purana chap. 23 narrates a fantastic story of the birth of Ganesa. 
The Ganapatyatharvaslrsa ( Anan. ed. ) identifies Ganesa with 
supreme Brahma.* The worship of the images of planets is

comparatively ancient. Y&j. I. 296-298 prescribes that the 
images for the worship of the nine grahas ( planets ) viz. the 
Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu 
and Ketu ( the last two are the nodal points ) should be made 
respsctively of copper, crystal, red sandal-wood, gold ( for 
both Mercury and Jupiter ), silver, iron, lead and bronze. 
Yaj. then prescribes the details of the worship of the planets 
such as the olothes to be gifted, the flowers, incenses, offer* 
ings, and the mantras ( from the Vaj. S. ), the fual-sticks, 
the food, and the fee. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 297 quotes nine 
verses from the Matsyapurana, chap. 94, concerning the details 
of the images of the nine planets. 

About SarasvatI, the goddess of learning, so early a writer 
as Dandin ( not later than 600 A. D. ) says that she was 
4 sarvasuklS ' ( all white ). 

Another deity whose worship is very popular in the Deccan 
is Dattatreya. His worship cannot have originated later than 
the first centuries of the Christian era. In the Jabalopanisad, 
he is referred to as a paramaharhsa and there is an Upanisad 
named after him. Vanaparva 115, Anusasana 153, Santi 49. 36, 
say that he conferred boons on Kartavirya. Markandeyapurana 
( chap. 16-19 ) gives the story of his birth, calls him a yogin 
and asserts that he was offered wine and meat by his devotees 
( 19. 10-12 ). The Bhagavata IX 23. 23, Matsya 47. 242-246 
and other puranas also refer to him. In the Sisupalavadba of 
Magha he is spoken of as an avatara. 

The Visnudharmasutra"' 8 chap. 65 contains one of the 
earliest detailed description of devapuja ( of Vasudeva or 
Visnu). "After having well bathed and washed his hands 
and feet and performed acamana ( sipping of water ) he should 
worship Lord Vasudeva who is without beginning or end, 
before an idol or on the sacrificial ground. Having given 
animated form in his mind to Visnu with the mantra ' may the 
Asvins who possess life give thee life' (MaitrSyanl Sam.

a fan, a looking glass, an umbrella, a vehicle, a seat, all these 
objects he must announoe and place before God ( Visnu ) 
muttering the Gayatrl at the same time. After having thus 
worshipped Him, he must mutter the Purusasukta. After that 
he who desires to obtain eternal bliss should make oblations of 
clarified butter, while reciting the verses of the same hymn 
(Rg. X. 90)." The Baud. gr. parisesasutra II. 14 describes' 73 * the 
daily worship of Mahapurusa ( i. e. Visnu ). " A man after 
bathing should cowdung a pure and even spot and draw the 
image of Visnu, should offer whole grains of rice and flowers

words 'this kurca (bundle) of darbhas is made for the divine

the water poured therein, should then utter the Gayatrl mantra 
over it and should then turn it towards the sun with the syllable 
'om' till he desires (or till he is tired); from that water he 
offers water for washing the feet (padya) with Rg. I. 22. 18 
(trim pads &o); then after having put aside the stale flowers 
to the accompaniment of the vyahrtis, he should offer arghya 
with the verse Rg. I. 22. 17 (idarh Visnur) and should offer 
acamaniya with the verse 'divo v5 Visno' (Tai. S. I. 2. 13. 2); 
then he bathes the deity with the three verses Rg. X. 9. 1-3 
( apo hi stha &o ), with the four verses ' hiranya-varnah * (Tai. 
S. V. 6. 1. 1-2 ), with the anuvaka beginning with ' pavamanah 
suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. 1.4. 8) and with the mantra 'brahma 
jajnanam ' ( Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 2 ), with the VamadevI rk ( Rg. IV. 
26. 1 ), with the c yajuh-pavitra ' ( i. e. Tai. S. I. 2. 1 1 ). Then he 
satiates (the image of) the deity with water sprinkled round the 
deity keeping the right hand towards it and taking the twelve 
names (Kesava and others) with the vyahrtis; he offers a 
garment with the syllable ' om ', yajfiopavlta with the sacred 
Gayatrl, acamaniya with Rg. I. 22. 17, sandalwood paste with 
the verse ' gandhadvaram ' (Tai. Ar. X. 1), whole grains of 
rice ( aksata ) with the verse ' IravatI ' ( Rg. VII. 99. 3 ), flowers 
with Rg. I. 22. 20 (tad Visnoh), inoense (dhupa) with the 
Gayatrl, a lamp with the mantra 'uddlpyasva' (Tai. Ar. X. 1 ) 
and cooked food is offered with the formula 'devasya tva"; then 
he should offer flowers to the image repeating the twelve names 
of Visnu, associating with each name the verses from ' trlni 
pada* to 'sumrdlka bhavantu nah* (Tai. Br. II. 4.6). Then 
they laud him with verses derived from the Rgveda, Yajurveda, 
Samaveda or Atharvaveda in praise of Visnu; then he should 
bid good bye to the Purusa (i.e. Visnu) by uttering" 5 * the 
three vyahrtis ( in such formula as ' om bhuh purusamudvas- 
ayami ) and adding ' may the Lord, the Great Person, go away 
for ( my ) well-being, for conquest and for being seen again.'* 
In case the image is immovably fixed on a pedestal &o. the 
invocation to come and the bidding of good-bye are omitted. 
The Baud. grhya-sesasQtra (II. 17) contains theprooedure of the 
worship of Mahadeva ( Siva ). It is almost on the same lines 
as the worship of Visnu set out above with the difference that 
the names of Siva such as Mahadeva, Bhava, Rudra, Tryambaka

are substituted and some of the mantras are different. A few 
differences will be found in the text quoted below. It is stated 
therein that when the worship is of a Knga immovably fixed 
then there is no invocation to come and no bidding of 
good-bye. BM 

In the Pujaprakasa ( pp. 97-149 ) and other digests the 
methods of devapuja aooording to 6aunaka, Grhyapariaista, 
Rgvidhfina, Visnudharmottarapurana, Bhagavatapurana, the 
Narasimhapurana are set out in detail. But for want of spaoe 
they are all passed over. It will have been noticed from the 
passages of the Visnu Dh, S, and of Baudhayana cited above 
that devapuja contains certain items and stages in the whole 
procedure. These are called upaearaa ( ways of service ). They 
are usually stated to be sixteen. They are : Svahana, asana, 
padya, arghya, ficamanlya, snana, vastra, yajfiopavlta, anu- 
lepana or gandha, puapa, dhupa, dlpa, naivedya (or upa- 
hftra), namaskara, pradaksins and visarjana or udvftsana. 
In different works, the items differ. Some add bhusana ( orna- 
ment ) after yajfiopavlta and tambula ( or mukhavSsa ) after 
pradaksina or naivedya ( Vrddha-Harita VI. 31-32 andPujS- 
prakfisa, p. 98 ). Therefore some speak of 18 upac&ras. m * 
Some omit Svahana, add svagata ( welcome ) after asana, 
madhuparka after acamanlya, and some have stotra ( hymn of 
praise ) and pranSma ( bow ) as distinct upaearaa, while others

perform only ten out of these 16 upac&ras viz. from pftdya to 
naivedya ; if be cannot afford to offer even ten he may offer 
only five ( paficopaoSra-pujS ) viz. from gandha to naivedya ; if 
he has nothing he may perform with flowers alone all the 16 
upaoaras. When the image is immovably fixed on a pedestal 
there is no Svfthana and visarjana and so the items become 14 
or one may offer in their place only a handful of flowers with 
mantras. im Those who can repeat the Purusasukta (Rg. X. 90) 
should repeat one of its verses before offering eaoh of the 16 
upac&ras ( see Nrsimhapurfina 62. 9-13 ). Those who cannot 
repeat that hymn and women and sudras should simply say 
' Siv&ya namah ' or ' Visnave namah * ( adoration to Siva or 
Visnu ). Vrddha-Harlta ( XI. 81 ) specially recommends the 
worship of the child Krsna to women and of Hari to widows 
( XI. 208 ). 17M After each of snftna, vastra, yajnopavlta and 
naivedya, Soamana is to be offered as part of that upacSra m> 
(vide Nrsimhapurfina 62. 14). The names of some of these 
upac&ras occur even in the Asv. gr. ( IV. 7. 10 and IV. 8. 1 ) in 
* relation to the brfihmanas invited at sraddha such as fisana, 
arghya, gandha, m&lya (flowers), dhupa, dlpa and ficchadana (i.e. 
vastra ). Farquhar is not right when he says in his ' Outlines 
of the Religious literature of India ' p. 51 that the sixteen 
upacaraa ' are so distinct in character from the sacrificial cult 
as to betray alien origin-' When image-worship became general 
items offered to invited brahmanas were also offered to the 
image of gods. It was a case of extension and not of borrowing 
from an alien cult. 

A few words have to be said in connection with some of 
the 16 upac&ras. 

As regards the water to be employed in devapuja and rites 
for the Manes, the Visnu Dh. S. (66. 1) prescribes that it should 
not have been brought the night before ( but it must be drawn

that day ). The worshipper should not sit on an asana made of 
bamboo or stone, or of unsaorificial wood or on the bare ground, 
or on a seat made of grass or green leaves, but should sit on a 
woollen blanket or silken garment or deer-skin ( Pujaprakasa, 
p. 95 ). When offering arghya, in the vessel containing the 
water to be used for that purpose all or as many as one oan 
afford out of the following eight articles are to be mixed up, viz. 
curds, whole grains of rice, ends of kusa grass, milk, durva 
grass, honey, barley grains and white mustard seeds ( Matsya- 
purana 267. 2 quoted in the Pujaprakasa p. 3d). It is further said 
that arghya is offered to the image of Visnu by means of a 
conch in which water is mixed with sandalwood paste, flowers 
and whole grains of rice. In the water for aoamana are mixed 
cardamom, cloves, uiira grass and kakkola or as many of them 
as possible. The snana ( bath ) of images is effected with five 
materials called paftcamrta ( five ambrosial things ) viz. milk, 
curds, clarified butter, honey and sugar. 1M0 The image is to be 
bathed with these five in the order stated, so that sugar coming 
last removes all effects of oiliness. After these a bath with 
pure water follows. In the pancamrtasnana the following 
Vedic verses are repeated in order ; ' apyayasva ' (Rg. I. 91. 16), 
' dadhikravno ' ( Rg. IV. 39. 6 ), ' ghrtam mimikse ' ( Bg. II. 
3. 11 ), ' madhu vata ' ( Ug. I. 90. 6 ), ' svaduh pavasva ' ( Rg. 
IX. 85.6). It will be noticed that each of these mantras is 
suggestive of the material with regard to which it is uttered. 
No bath with water or these things is allowed when only a 
picture or a clay image is to be worshipped. If one cannot 
afford these, one may bathe the image with water in which the 
leaves of the basil plant ( tulasl ) are mixed up, as that plant 
is deemed to be the favourite of Visnu. The water used in 
the bath of the image of a God is regarded as very sacred 
and it is used for acamana by the worshipper and members 
of his family and friends and is called tlrtha ( it is also 
sprinkled over one's head ). IW As regards the unguents to be 
offered ( anulepana or gandha ) numerous rules are laid down

(vide Pujaprakasa pp. 39-41). The Visnu"** Dh. S. (66.2) 
says that unguents should be one or more out of san dalwood, pine 
tree paste, musk, camphor, saffron, nutmeg. If ornaments are 
offered, then gold and precious stones should be real and not 
imitation ones ( Visnu Dh. S. 66. 4 ). Very detailed rules are 
laid down about flowers. The Pujaprakasa ( pp. 42-49 ) waxes 
eloquent over the merit of offering basil leaves to Visnu and 
using the same wood in worship generally and also when no 
flowers are available. The Visnu Dh. S. m * ( 66. 5-9 ) prescribes 
that flowers emitting an overpowering smell or having no smell 
whatever are not to be used, nor flowers of thorny plants unless 
the flowers are white and sweetly fragrant ; that even Ted flowers 
suoh as saffron flowers and those that spring in ponds or lakes 
may be employed. There are grades in the merit derived from 
offering certain flowers, e. g. the Sm. C. I, pp. 201-202 and the 
Pujaprakasa p. 51 quote many verses of the NarasimhapurSna, 
some of which arrange vanamallika, campaka, asoka, vasantl, 
malatl, kunda &o. in an ascending order among flowers and 
the jatl flower is said to be the best of the flowers in the worship 
of Visnu. The same work ( p. 56 ) names durva and twentyfive 
flowers as favourites with Visnu. Vide Vrddba-Hanta VII. 
53-59 for the flowers that may be used in Visnu-puja and 
Vrddha Gautama p. 563. The flowers offered on a day are 
removed the next day by the worshipper when he is about to 
offer worship that day. Suoh flowers are called ' nirmalya ' and 
great virtue is attaohed to placing suoh flowers on one's head 
by way of homage to the deity worshipped ( vide Pujaprakasa, 
pp. 27 and 90 ). The Sm. G. ( I. p. 204 ) quotes a purftna to the 
effect 'He, whose heart contemplates the form of Visnu, on 
whose lips there is ever the name of Visnu, who partakes of the 
naivedya offered to Visnu and who places on his head the water 
in which the feet of an image of Visnu are washed and the 
nirmalya of Visnu, never falls off (from heaven).' The Madana- 
parijata ( p. 303 ) quotes passages from the Visnu-dharmottara 
about the flowers, that are not to be used in worship. In Siva 
worship the following flowers and leaves are in an ascending 
grade of worth ; viz. arka flowers, karavlra flowers, bilva leaves, 
flower of drona, leaves of apamarga, flower of kusa, saml leaves,

which is the best ( vide Pujaprakasa, p. 210 ). The Madana- 
parij&ta, p. 303 quotes from the Devlpurana verses whioh 
enumerate the flowers that are to be avoided in &iva worship. 
If no flowers are available, then a fruit may be offered or if no 
fruit is available then only leaves and lastly only white whole 
grains of rice or even water may be offered. m * Lamps are to 
be fed with ghee or in its absence with sesame oil. 174> Camphor 
is to be burnt before the image. There is a oeremony called 
aratrika ( waving lights round the image ) performed with 
several lights or pieces of camphor placed in a broad vessel 
which is held in both hands and waved round an image and 
over its head. Vide Pujaprakasa, pp. 75 and 87. For naivedya 
no food is to be offered whioh is declared unfit in the sastras for 
eating, nor the milk of a she-goat or she-buffalo though they are 
allowed for food, nor the meat of the five-nailed animals nor the 
flesh of the wild boar nor fish. The general rule is stated by the 
Ramayana as ' whatever food a man eats the same is the food to 
be offered to his deities *. Im The Sm. 0. ( I. p. 203 ) quotes the 
Padmapurana to the effect that naivedya should be offered in a 
vessel of gold, silver, bronze, copper or of day or in palasa 
leaves or on lotus leaf. The naivedya is offered with the formula 
set out below. mT Aooording to the Brahmapurana quoted by 
Apararka, pp. 153-154 and Pujaprakasa ( p. 82 ) the naivedya 
offered to Brahma, Visnu, Siva, the Sun, Devi, the Matrs, to 
goblins and evil spirits respectively is to be given to brahma- 
nas, Satvatas ( Bhagavatas ), those whose bodies are smeared 
with ashes, to Magas, to the Saktas, to women, to the poor. ms

One may also partake of the naivedya offered by oneself 
and the Smrtimuktaphala ( ahnika, p. 390 ) quotes Rg. 
L 151 5 in support. After naivedya, tambUla is to be offered to 
the God worshipped. In the ancient grhya and dharma sutras no 
mention is made of tambula or mukhavasa ( materials that will 
render the breath fragrant ). Tambula was probably introduoed 
some time before or about the beginning of the Christian era in 
South India and then spread northwards. Among the srnrtis, 
Samvarta 55 quoted in the Krtyaratnakara p. 560, Laghu-HSrlta 
( Auand. 39 ), Laghu-Asvalayana ( Anand. ) 1. 160-61 and 23. 
105, Ausanasa ( Jivananda, part I. p. 509 ) refer to the chewing 
of tambula after dinner. In the Raghuvarhsa VI. 64 Kalidasa 
describes betelnut plants surrounded by betel creepers. The 
KamasfUra L 4. 16 m * states that a person after performing the 
brushing of the teeth, consulting a looking glass and partaking 
of tambula for rendering his breath fragrant should set about 
his daily business. Vide also Kamasutra III. 4. 40, IV. 1. 36, 
V. 2. 21 and 24, VI. 1. 29, VI. 2. 8 for other references. In the 
Brhat-samhita of Varahamihira ( 77. 35-37 ) the virtues of 
tambula and its ingredients are described. In the Kadambarl 
( para 85 ) the royal palaoe is compared to the house of a dealer 
in betel leaves ( tambulika ) in which lavall, cloves, cardamom , 
kankola are stored. The Par. M. I. part 1. p. 434 quotes four 
verses from Vasis^ha ( not found in the printed Dharmasutra ) 
about the cutting off of the two ends of tambula leaves before 
eating them. In the Vratakhanda ( of Caturvargacintamani, 
vol. IL part I, p. 242 ) Hemadri quotes Ratnakosa to the effect 
that tambula means betel leaves, betel nut and chunam ; while 
' mukhavasa ' means these together with cardamom, camphor, 
kakkola berries, pieoes of copra and matulunga. The Nityaoara- 
paddhati mo (p. 549) quotes verses showing that tambula 
comprised nine ingredients viz. betel nut, betel leaves, chunam, 
camphor, cardamom, clove, kankola, copra, the matulunga fruit. 
In modern times pieces of almond, nutmeg fruit and bark 
thereof, saffron, oateohu are taken and matulunga is 
omitted. Thus the thirteen ingredients of tambula are

made up. The Afftangasamgraha" 81 of Vagbha^a also mentions 
the several ingredients of tambula inoluding the essence of the 
bark of the Khadira tree ( catechu ). In modern times tambula 
is said to be of 13 gwQas, either because it contains thirteen 
ingredients or because it effects thirteen good results, the last of 
whioh are set out in a subhasita quoted below. 

Pradakslna ( going round the image with the right hand 
always turned towards the image ) and namaskara constitute 
only one upacara ( item of worship ) according to many. The 
namaskara to the image is either astanga ( with eight limbs ) or 
paficanga ( with five limbs. ) The first occurs when a person 
prostrates himself on the ground in front of the image in such 
a way that the palms of his hands, his feet, his knees, his chest 
and forehead touch the ground and his mind, speech and eye 
are fixed on the image and the latter occurs when he prostrates 
himself with his hands, feet and head. 1752 There are other 
definitions of the astanga namaskara. These several parts of 
the worship of images have been judicially noticed in Ram 
brahma Chatter ji v. Kedar Nath 36 Calcutta Law Journal 478 at 
'p. 483 ( where the normal type of the continuous worship of an 
idol is described ) and Pramatha Nath Mullick v. Pradyumna 
Kumar Mullick 52 Cal. 809 at p. 815 ( P. 0. ). 

In modern times it is the practice to perform in homage to 
the sun twelve namaskaras or any multiple of twelve and 
repeat the following twelve names of the sun in the dative 
preoeded by ' om ' and followed by ' namah ' : Mitra, Ravi, 
Surya, Bhanu, Khaga, Pusan, Hiranyagarbha, Marloi, Aditya, 
Savitr, Arka and Bhaskara. There is another method of these 
namaskaras called Troakalpanamaskaras in which after ' om *

The Pujaprak&sa (pp. 166-188) mentions 32 apar&dhas 
( lapses ) whioh should be avoided while engaged in worship or 
while one is about to perform Visnupuja and the atonements 
for these. These 32 apar&dhas (offences) against proper etiquette 
for worship are referred to in the Varahapurana ( 130. 5 ), 

A passage from Baudh&yana about Siva worship has 
already been quoted and it has been stated that worship of the 
phallic emblem of Siva appears to have been current in the 
very ancient civilization brought to light by the finds dis- 
covered at Mohenjo-daro. Sir R. G. Bhandarkar in his ' Vai* 
snavism and Saivism' has shown how Budra is described as 
the supreme deity even in the Rg., how in the Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-11 
there are eleven anuvakas (called Budras) whioh contain a 
sublime eulogy of Budra (and also in Vfij. 8. 16) and how 
numerous Saiva sects and doctrines arose in course of time 
(p. 119 ff). Panini teaches the formation of BhavanI, SarvanI 
Budrfinl and MrdanI from the four names of Siva ( IV. 1. 59 ), 
In the sacrifice called Sulagava in the grhya sutras Budra is 
worshipped as the supreme deity. The Asv. gr. IV. 9.17 mentions 
twelve names of Budra and adds l7M (IV. 9.27-39) that all names 
In the world, all armies, all exalted things belong to him. Patau jali 
in his Mahabhasya (vol. II. pp.387-388) on Panini V. 2. 76 speaks 
of a 'Siva-bhagavata' ( a devotee of Siva). Ved&ntasutra IL 2. 37 
is . directed, aooording to Samkara, to the refutation of the 
Pasupata seot of Saivas. In the Santiparva 284. 121-124 the 
Pasupatas are said to be opposed to the dharmas of varna and 
asrama. The Kurmapurana'(purvardha, chap. 16) speaks of the

s&stras of the Saiva sects, of Kapalas, Nakulas ms (Lakulas?), 
Vamas, Bhairavas, Pasupatas as meant for deluding the world. 
The VarahapurSna (chap.70-71) is also directed against Pasupatas. 
The Pasupata brahmanas are stated in the Kadambarl to have 
surrounded the minister Sukanasa (para 90). Siva was worship- 
ped in the form of the linga or as an image. It is believed that 
14 crores of lihgas were established by Bana, an Asura devotee of 
Siva, in various spots and these are called Bana-lingas ( Nifcya- 
carapaddhati, p. 556 ) and the Bana-lingas ( white stones ) found 
in the Narmada, the Ganges and other holy rivers are only like 
them. In the Kadambarl ( para 130 ) Bana speaks of sand lingas 
on the Acchoda lake and in another place of a linga made of 
pure mother-o'pearl. The Kurmapurana ( purvardha chap. 26 ) 
describes the origin of Linga and its worship and the Vamana- 
purana 46 lauds the several holy places where ancient lihgas 
are established. The famous twelve Jyotir-lingas are; Omkara 
at MSndhata, Mahakala at UjjayinI (modern Ujjain), Tryambaka 
( near Nasik ), Dbrsnesvara at Elora, Naganatha ( towards the 
east of Ahmednagar ), Bhlma-Samkara ( at the souroe of the 
Bhlma river in the Sahyadri ), Kedara-natha in Garhwal, Vis- 
vesvara at Benares, Somanatha in Kathiawar, Vaidyanatha new 
Parali. Mallikarjuna on the Srlsaila, and Bamesvara in South 
India. Many of these are situated in central and western India 
near each other.

Mahesvara may be worshipped by means of the mantra of five

' om ' or by the mantra ' Isanah sarva-vidyanam ' ( Tai. Ar. 
X. 47 ), or by the Rudra mantras ( viz. Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-11 ) or by 
the mantra ' tryambakarh yajamahe ' ( Rg. VII. 59. 12 ). For a 
devotee of Siva, the wearing of a string of RudrSksa berries is 
necessary either on the hand, the arm, the neck or on the 
head. 17 " The Smrtimuktaphala ( fthnika p. 393 ) quotes verses 
from the Smrtiratna and the Ratnavali about the merit secured 
by bathing the linga with cow's milk, curds, clarified butter, 
boney, sugarcane juice, paflcagavya, water in which camphor 
and aguru are mixed up, and other substances. The 14th day 
of the dark half of a month has been sacred to Siva from 
ancient times. B&na in the Kadambarl ( para 54 ) refers to the 
fact that queen Vil&savatl went to worship Mahakala at 
UjjayinI on the 14th. 

The worship of Durga has prevailed from ancient times.'™ 
She is worshipped under various names and aspects. In the 
Tai. Ar. X. 18 Siva is said to be the husband of Ambika 
or Urns. In the Kena Upanisad ( III. 25 ) Uma HaimavatI 
is mentioned as imparting to Indra the knowledge of the 
Great Being. The various names of Durga are Uma, ParvatI, 
Devi, Ambika, Gauri, Candl or Oandika, Kali, Kumarl, 
Lalita &c. The Mahabharata ( Vir&taparva 6 and Bhlsma 23 ) 
contains two hymns addressed to Durga in whioh she is stated 
to be VindbyavasinI and fond of blood and wine, and in 
Vanaparva 39. 4 it is stated that UmS became a kiratl 
when Siva became a kirata to test the prowess of Arjuna. In 
the Kumar asambhava Kalidasa speaks of ParvatI, Uma, Aparna 
and derives the latter two words ( I. 26 and V. 28 ). Ysj. I. 290 
speaks of Ambika as the mother of VinSyaka. The Devl- 
mahfitmya in the MarkandeyapurSna ( chap. 81-93 ) is the 
principal sacred text of Durga worshippers in Northern India. 
E. I. vol. 9 p. 189 shows that about 625 A. D. Durga was 
invoked as a supreme goddess. Bana in his Kadambarl gives a 
graphic description of the temple of Candika and refers to offer* 
ings of blood made to her ( para 28 ), to her trident ( trisula ) 
and her slaughter of Mahisasura. The KrtyaratnSkara ( p. 351 ) 
quotes verses from the Devlpur&na that the 8th of the bright 
half of a month is sacred to Devi ( and particularly of Asvina ),

that a goat or a buffalo may be sacrificed for her.'"' These 
bloody rites are still continued in the Kali temple in Bengal 
and a few other shrines of Durga. In Bengal the worship of 
Durga in Asvina has been most popular. 17 * Baghunandana 
in his Durgareana-paddhati gives an elaborate description of 
the worship of Durga in Asvina. Durga is also worshipped 
as Sakti. The influence of Sakta worship has been great 
throughout India and will be briefly surveyed later on. 

In modern times devapuja differs considerably from the ritual 
of the ancient works of Visnu and BaudhSyana ; it also differs 
from province to province and caste to caste. A brief analysis 
of the devapuja practised by brahmanas in Western India is 
given below : Aoamana ; pranSy ama ; adoration to Mahaganapati 
and certain other deities; twelve names of Ganesa, hymn 
of praise to Ganesa, Gaurl, Visnu ; mention of the place and 
the time with astronomical details about the day, the 
naksatra &e. ; then the saihkalpa of performing devapuja 
with sixteen upacaras ; contemplation on Ganapati with 
Bg- II. 23. 1 ( gananam tva ) ; asanavidhi with an invocation 
to the earth ; nyasa ( mystical sanctification of the body ) of 
the sixteen verses of Bg- X. 90 on sixteen parts of the 
body ; invocation of the deities and the saored rivers in the 
water jar and offering sandalwood paste, flowers and whole 
grains of rice to the jar ; then invocation of the conch and bell 
in a similar way; sprinkling of oneself and the materials of 
worship with water accompanied by the mantra (' apavitrah 
pavitro va &o.' ) ; dhyana ( contemplation ) of Visnu, Siva, 
Ganesa, the sun's disc, Durga holding a bunch of flowers in 
one's folded hands ; then offering the sixteen upacaras enume- 
rated above to the accompaniment of the 16 verses of Bg. X. 90 
to one's favourite deity; final benediction. "" When several 
deities are worshipped, there are two methods in which the 
upacaras may be offered. One may offer the upacaras from 
avahaoa to namaskara to one deity or the principal deity and 
then the s:ime upacaras to the other deity or deities one after

another. This method is called kandanusamaya. The other method 
occurs when avahana is done for the several deities in order, 
then asana for all, then pfidya for all and so on up to namas- 
kara, This is called padarthanusamaya. This method is 
generally preferred. Vide the com. of Narsyana on As v. gr. I. 
24. 7, the com. on Katyayana-srauta I. 5. 9-11 for detailed 
explanations of these. 

From the early centuries of the Christian era the works on 
Tantra exercised a profound influence on the ritual of devapQja 
and several mystical postures of the hands and fingers suoh as 
the mudras and the nyasas began to occupy the minds of the 
worshippers."' 8 The Bhagavata-purana XI. 27. 7 says that 
devapuja is of three kinds viz. VaidikI, TantrikI and migra. The 
first and the third are for the three varnas and TantrikI for 
sudras.

CHAPTER XX 

VAISVADEVA 

Vaiivadeva.—{ offering of cooked food to all Gods ). 

Daksa ( II. 56 ) says that in the 5th part of the day a house- 
holder has to allow distribution of food according to his ability 
to the gods, Manes, men and even insects. Vaisvadeva is to be 
offered according to Satatapa ( quoted by Medhatithi on Manu 

V. 7 and by Apararka p. 142 ) in the grhya fire if one has 
preserved it, or in the ordinary fire. If no fire is available one 
may offer it even in water or on the bare ground. Laghu- 
Vyasa II. 52 says the same. 

Some medieval works like the Smrtyarthas&ra and the 
Par. M. ( I. part 1, p. 389 ) state that vaisvadeva really com- 
prises the three daily sacrifices viz. devayajna, bhutayajiia 
and pifcryajna. The rite is so called because in it sacrifice 
is offered to all the gods or because food is cooked therein for 
all the gods. ,m But in the anoient grhyasutras the three 
yajnas are kept distinct. In the Asv. gr. Ill, 1 the five daily 
sacrifices are enumerated, but only one, the brahmayajna, is 
thereafter described in detail and we have to understand that 
Vaisvadeva has already been dealt with under homa in Asv. 
gr I. 2. 1-2 and that I. 2. 3-10 is concerned with bhutayajiia or 
baliharana, out of which the 7th sutra contemplates an offering 
to'Visve-devas and sutra 10 an offering of cooked food to pitrs. 
The San. gr. II. 14 speaks of Vaisvadeva, while Gobhila gr. I. 4. 
1-15, Khadira gr. I. 5. 22-35 speak of baliharana only. Panini 

VI. 2. 39 teaches the acoent of 'ksullaka-vaisvadeva' (as a 
compound). Vaik. ,w * VI. 17 expressly says that devayajna 
is the homa to the gods offered with cooked food meant for all the 
gods. According to Gautama (V. 9) the deities of vaisvadeva 
are Agni, Dhanvantari, Visve-devas, Prajapati and Svistakrt 
(Agni). According" 65 to Manu (III. 84-86) the deities are Agni,

Soma, Agnlsoma, the Visve-devas, Dhanvantari, Kuhu, Anumati, 
Prajftpati, Dyavaprthivl, ( Agni ) Svistakrt. The Sah. gr. 
II. 14. 4 gives the names of ten deities that are slightly different 
from the list of Manu. According to Far. gr. II. 9 the deities 
are Brahma, Prajapati, Grbya, Kasyapa and Anumati ; while 
the Visnu Dh. S. 67. 1-3 ( quoted in the Gr. R. p. 278 ) states 
that Vaisvadeva is to be offered to Vasudeva, Samkarsana, 
Aniruddha, Purusa, Satya, Aoyuta, Agni, Soma, Mitra, Varuna, 
Indra, Indragni, Visve-devas, Prajapati, Anumati, Dhanvantari, 
Vastospati, ( Agni ) Svistakrt. Vide Bhar. gr. III. 12, Manava 
gr. II. 12. 1-2, K&thaka gr. 54, Vaik. III. 7 for other lists 
of deities in Vaisvadeva. It is on account of this divergence 
that digests like the Madanaparijata ( p. 317 ) say that Vaisva- 
deva is of two kinds, viz. what is common to all smrtis like 
that of Manu and secondly what is stated in one's own 
grhyasutra. The Sm. 0. ( I. p. 212 ) 1T " says the same. 

All ancient smrtis Bay that Vaisvadeva is to be performed 
twice, once in the morning and then in the evening. Vide Asv, 
gr. I. 2. 1, Vas. Dh. S. XL 3, Manu III. 121, Visnu Dh. S. 59. 13, 
Gobhila II. 34. But in later times it came to be performed 
only once in the morning and the safnkalpa includes both in one 
statement. nn The verses ' justo dam una ' ( Rg. V. 4. 5 ) and 
•ehyagna' (Rg. I. 76. 2) are used in invoking Agni, then the 
verse * catvari srnga ' ( Rg. IV. 58. 3 ) and several ordinary 
verses describing the characteristics of Agni are employed for 
the dhySna ( contemplation ) of Agni. From the food cooked 
for one's meal, a portion is taken out in another vessel, and 
oovered with clarified butter; it is then divided into three parts. 
Then one places one's left hand on one's heart and with the 
right hand takes up from one portion of the food morsels equal 
to a ripe myrobalan fruit, presses it with one's right thumb and 
offers it with the right band to Surya, Prajapati, Soma Vanaspati, 
Agnl-soma, Indrftgni, Dyavaprthivl, Dhanvantari, Indra, Visve 
Devas, Brahma. Then holy ashes are taken from the fire with 
the mantra ' ma nastoke ' ( Rg. I. 114. 8 ) and ashes are applied 
to the forehead, the throat, the navel, the right and left shoulders 
and the head with certain mantras and a concluding prayer is

offered to Agni to bestow intelligence, memory, fame &o. as 
set out below."'* 

Medieval digests like tbe Mit. ( on Yaj. 1. 103 ) discuss tbe 
question whether vaisvadeva is purusartha only ( i. e. recommend- 
ed to men for effecting some beneficent oonsequence to them) or 
whether it is purusartha as well as a rite for effeoting a 
sarhskara ( unseen or spiritual result ) of the food cooked. In 
the latter case food will be pradhana ( the principal matter ) 
and vaisvadeva will be secondary ; but in the former case ( i. e. 
if it were only purusartha ) food will be secondary and Vaisva- 
deva principal. Relying ,7M on Asv. gr. I. 2. 1 some say that 
vaisvadeva is meant as a samskara of food and relying on Asv. 
gr. III. 1. 1 and 4 others say that it is purusartha. The Mit. 
declares that vaisvadeva is purusartha only, as Manu ( II. 28 ) 
holds that the human body is rendered fit for spiritual know- 
ledge by the daily yajfias and by other sacrifices and that if 
vaisvadeva is not purusartha alone, each time food is cooked in 
the day (on account of the sudden advent of many guests) 
vaisvadeva would have to be performed several times in the 
day ; but Manu III. 108 forbids a fresh vaisvadeva in such a 
case. Sm. 0. ( I. p. 213 ) and Par. M. ( I. 1. p. 390 ) hold the 
same view. The SmrtyarthasSra p. 46 and Laghu-AsvalSyana 
1. 116 hold the view that vaisvadeva is both for the samsk&ra 
of the householder and also of the food. mo 

There was divergence of view on other questions viz. 
whether vaisvadeva was to be performed before sraddha or after 
it and whether food for vaisvadeva was to be separately cooked 
from that meant for sraddha. Apararka p. 462 sets out the 
conflicting views on the first question and says that for vaisva- 
deva there are three options, viz. it may be performed imme- 
diately after food is ready, or it may be offered after baliharana 
or it may be performed after sraddha is finished. The Madana-

pftrijata p. 320 and Brhat-Par&sara p. 156 hold thai; vaisvadeva 
must be performed before srftddha. Vide SmrtimuktSphala 
( Shnika pp. 406-407 ) also; on the other hand AnusSBana-parva 
( 97. 16-18 ) directs that on sr&ddha day, pitr-tarpana comes first, 
then offering of bali, and then vaisvadeva. The Madanaparijata 
p. 318 says that the food for the vaisvadeva must be separately 
cooked from what is meant for sraddha. In the case of a joint 
family of father and sons or of several brothers, the father alone 
performs vaisvadeva or the eldest brother ; but if the father or 
eldest brother is unable to do it himself, a son or younger brother 
may offer it at his bidding ( Laghu-Asvalayana 1. 117-119 ). 

The food to be offered should be sprinkled over with ghee 
or with curds or milk but not with oil or salt. Ap. Dh. S. mi 
II. 6. 15. 12-14 prescribes that there is to be no homa of JcsSra 
and lavaya ( vide note 723 above ) and also of food that is mixed 
up with inferior food ( like kulattha &c. ) ; but if one is com- 
pelled to offer inferior food in vaisvadeva ( owing to poverty 
&c. ) he should take some hot ashes from the gray a or ordinary 
fire towards the north of the fire and offer the food in the ashes. 
The Smrtyarthasara 1778 p. 47 states that cereals like gram and 
mfisa beans are not to be used in vaisvadeva food. Even when 
a man was not going to eat on a particular day he had to offer 
vaisvadeva ( Apararka p. 145 ). If he could afford no food, be 
waB to offer fruits, roots or even water. 1773 He who has no grhya 
fire may offer vaisvadeva food into the ordinary fire with only 
the vyShrtis and the rest may be left for crows. 

Ap. Dh. 8. ( II. 2. 3. 1 and 4 ) says that vaisvadeva food 
should be cooked by aryas ( persons of the twice-born classes ) 
that are purified ( by bathing &c. ), or sudras supervised by 
aryas may cook the food. 1 ™ Medieval writers remarked, as 
usual, that the latter rule about sudras being cooks applied only 
to another age. 1775 Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 2. 3. 10-11 ) further says

that when the food is ready i.e. cooked, the cook should announce 
while standing, to the owner of the house ' it is ready ' and the 
owner should reply ' it ( food ) is auspiciously ready, it is food 
that gives supremaoy ; may it not be lost. ' If no vaisvadeva 
is performed on any day, the householder had to fast the day 
and night ( Gobhila-smrti III. 120 ). Daksa II. 62 and Yama 
condemn to hell him who takes his own meal without offering 
vaisvadeva, when he is not himself in distress or difficulty. me 

It has been stated above (p.158) that the sudra was to offer all 
the five yajflas without Vedic or Pauranic mantras, but only with 
the word 'namah' and he was to use uncooked food for vaisvadeva. 
Vide Yaj. 1. 121 and the Mit. thereon and Ahnikaprakasa, p. 401. 

Baliharaya or BhutayajHa : — Here also there is some diver- 
gence between the ancient grhya-sutras and medieval and 
modern praotice. The Siv. gr. I. 2. 3-11 deals with this. The 
deities to whom ball ( or part of the food taken out when per- 
forming vaisvadeva) is offered are: to the same deities to whom 
the devayajfia is offered as stated above, to the waters, to herbs 
and trees, to the house, to the domestic deities, to the deities of 
the ground ( on which the house is built ), to Indra and Indra's 
men, to Yama and Yama's men, to Varuna and Varuna's men, 
to Soma and Soma's men ( these are offered in the several 
quarters xm ), to Brahman and Brahman's men in the middle, 
to the Visve-devas, to all day-walking beings, to the Raksases- 
towards the north ; svadha to the pitrs ( Manes )-with these 
words he should pour out the remnant of the food to the south, 
while wearing the sacred thread suspended over the right 
shoulder. Asv. adds that if baliharaya is performed by night 
then the words 'to all night-walking beings' are used instead 
of 'to all day- walking beings'. 

Gobhila gr. I. 4. 5-15, Par. gr. II. 9 and other grhya sutras, 
JLp. Dh. S. IL 2. 3. 15-11. 2. 4. 9, Gautama V. 10-15, differ con- 
siderably from the above in several respects. But for want of 
space no reference can be made to these differences. 

In bhutayajfia, bali is to be mB offered not into fire but on

with water, and then the bali is to be put down and water 
is poured on it thereafter. Vide Ap. Dh. 8. IL 2. 3. 15. The 
Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 4. 9. 5-6 ) prescribes that one should make 
all including dogs and candalas participators in the food 
cooked for vaisvadeva and adds the view of some (which 
he disapproves) that one should not give food to the un- 
deserving. 1779 Manu III. 87-93 says that after performing vais- 
vadeva one should offer balis in all directions to Indra, 
Yama, Varuna, Soma and their followers, a bali to Maruts on 
the door, to waters a bali in water, a bali to the trees in 
mortar and pestle, a bali to Sri on the top of the house, to 
Bhadrakall at the foot of the house, to Brahma and Vastospati 
in the midst of the house ; a bali may be thrown up in the sky to 
Visve Devas, to the day-walking beings ( when baliharana is 
done by day ) and to night-walking beings ( by night ) ; a bali 
should be offered to the prosperity of all on the first floor 17 " and 
all the remaining portion of the food for balis should be offered 
to the manes towards the south ; the householder should lightly 
( so that no dust will get mixed with it ) offer on the ground 
some food to dogs, to outcasts, to candalas, to those suffering 
from loathsome diseases (such as leprosy), to crows and insects. 
Yaj. I. 103 calls upon the householder to throw food to dogs, 
candalas and crows on the ground. 1781 

These directions to give food even to outcasts, dogs and 
birds were the outcome of the noble sentiment of universal 
kindliness and oharity, the idea that One Spirit pervades and 
illumines the meanest of creatures and binds all together. The 
San. gr. ( II. 14 ) ,7M winds up its vaisvadeva section with this 
fine exhortation "let him throw food to dogs, to svapaoas (eaters

the mantra says 'the fool gets food in vain* ( Rg. X. 117. 6 ). ' 
The MahabhSrata ( Vanaparva II. 59 ) says that offering food to 
dogs, svapaca3 and birds on the ground is known as vaisvadeva, 
whioh is performed in the morning and evening. The same 
verse occurs at Anusasanaparva 97. 22-23. Apararka p. 145 says 
that vaisvadeva comprises all actions from the offering into 
fire oblations of food up to the throwing of food to dogs and 
the like in the morning and the evening. 

In modern times the way in which balis are offered and 
their number are set out in the diagram below. The one drawn 
is for the morning baliharana. For the evening one the only 
change necessary would be to put ' agnaye svaha ' ( No. 1 ) in 
place of ' surySya svaha ' and ' naktam-caribhyah ' for ' diva- 
caribhyah * in No. 27. The word ' svaha ' is not repeated in the 
diagram after each name' 783 for the sake of space. Manu III. 121 
prescribes that bali is offered in the evening by the wife but 
without mantras ( i. e. she is not to repeat the mantras) ' Indraya 
svaha ' &c, but only to contemplate on the several deities.

Pitryqjila :— The word oocura in Rg. X. 16. 10, but its 
exact meaning is not certain. Pitryajfia may be performed in 
either of three ways as stated above ( on p. 700 ) viz. by tarpana 
( Manu III. 70 and 283 ), or by performing baliharana in which 
remnants of bali food are to be offered to the pitrs (Manu III. 91 
and Asv. gr. 1. 2. 11) or by performing sraddha daily with food on 
inviting at least one brahmana for dinner ( Manu III. 82-83 ). 
Sraddhas will be dealt with later and the other two ( tarpana 
and baliharana ) have already been dealt with. In this daily 
sraddha 178 * there is no offering of plndas ( balls of rice ) and 
the several strict rules and procedure of the parvaya sraddha 
do not apply.

NRYAJNA OR MANU$YA-YAJNA. 

NryajM or Manusyaryajrla : (Honouring guests). — Manu 
( III. 70 ) states that this consists in honouring guests. In the 
oldest hymns of the Rgveda fire is described as a guest in the 
house of the sacrifioer. In Rg. I. 73. 1 Agni is described as 
lying in a pleasant spot and pleased like a guest (syonaslr- 
atithir-na prlnfino). Vide Rg. V. 1. 8 ,785 and 9, V. 4. 5, 
VIL 42. 4 for fire being called atithi. In $g. IV. 4. 10 it is 
said of Agni 'you become the protector, the friend, of him who 
offers you hospitality in the usual (or proper) order.' Vide 
Eg. IV. 33. 7 and Tai. S. I. 2. 10. 1 for the word atithya. Athar- 
vaveda IX 6 is an eulogy of hospitality in which the various 
stages in the reception and feeding of a guest are metaphori- 
cally represented as the various actions performed in a sacri- 
fice. im The Tai. S. V. 2. 2. 4 refers to the fact that 'when a 
guest comes, hospitality in whioh ghee abounds, is offered to 
him * and it remarks that ' one who comes in a chariot and one 
who comes in a cart are the two most honoured among 
guests. ,OT ' The Tai. S. ( VI. 2. 1. 2 ) says ' hospitality is offered 
to all the followers acoompanied by whom a king comes*. Vide 
Ait. Br. II. 9 for almost the same words. The !§&n. Br. II. 9 
remarks IT88 ' when a man offers oblations at sunrise, he indeed 
offers hospitality to a great god who has started on a journey.' 
The Tai. Br. ( II. 1. 3 ) shows that a guest was honoured by 
having a lit lamp placed before him and then food was 
served to him." 89 The Ait. Br. (25.5) says that a guest

should not be refused in the evening. ,790 The Sat. Br. (II. 1.4. 2. 
S. B. E. vol. 12, p. 291) remarks that 'it would be unbecoming 
for a person to take food before men who are staying with 
him as guests have eaten '. The Satapatha shows that an ox or 
a goat was oooked for a guest, either a king or a br&hmana 
( III. 4. 1. 2 ). Vide also Ait. Br. 3. 4 for the offering of an ox or 
barren cow to a king or another deserving person coming as 
a guest. Yfij. 1. 109 also says that a big ox or a goat was to 
be kept apart for a guest learned in the Veda. But the Mit. 
and other ,7 *' medieval writers to whom fleBh-eating was an 
anathema and an unspeakable sin for a brahmana remark that 
an ox or a goat was to be understood as set apart for the guest 
to flatter him (with the words ' this ox is yours ') just as one 
says in humility ' all this house is yours ' and that the ox or 
goat was not meant to be given in gift or to be killed since it 
would be impossible to find an ox each time a srotriya guest 
came. The Ait Ar. I. 1. 1 remarks ' whoever is good and has 
attained eminence is a ( real ) guest, people do not treat with 
hospitality one who is undeserving. ,ms In the Tai. Up. ( 1. 11. 
2 ) one of the exhortations of the teacher to the pupil returning 
home is 'atithi-devo bhava' (honour guests). The same Upanisad 
says elsewhere ( III. 10. 1 ) " let him never turn away a stranger 
from his house, that is the rule. Therefore a man should by 
all means acquire much food, for people say ( to the guest ) 
' there is food ready for him. ' If he gives food amply, food is 
given to him amply". In the Katbopanisad 1783 (I. 7-9) it is 
said 'a brahmana entering a house as a guest is ( like ) fire. 
People offer this ( well-known ) appeasement to him. Oh, son of 
Vivasvat, offer him water ( to wash his feet ). If a brahmana 
guest stays in a man's house without food, he cuts off ( destroys) 
the hopes and expectations, ( fruits of ) the friendship ( of the 
good), the rewards of sacrifices and charitable acts, sons and 
cattle. ' Then Yama offered to bestow three boons on Naciketas 
as some penanoe for allowing Naciketas to remain without food

in his house for three days. The Nirukta 17 " IV. 5 in explaining 
Jig. V. 4. 5 ( justo damuna atithirdurona ) derives the word 
4 atithi' from the root 'at' to go and also from 'tifchi ' (day ) and 
'a' meaning 'comes' (from *i' with 'abhi'). Vide Maim III. 102 
for another derivation; also Parasara L 42 and Mark. 29. 2-9. 
Manu and others say that an atithi is so called because he does 
not stay for a whole tithi ( i. e. day ) and ' an atithi is a brahmana 
who stays for one night only as a guest. ' 

The honouring of guests comes after the offering of bali 
and Baud. gr. II. 9. 1-2, Vas. XL 6, Visnupurana III. 11. 55 
ordain that after baliharava the householder should wait in 
front of the yard of his house for as much time ns would be 
required for milking a cow or for a longer time at his desire 
for receiving guests. Others make it a definite time viz. one- 
eighth of a muhiirta (vide Mirk, purana 29. 24-25 quoted in 
Sm. 0. 1., p. 217 ). I7,s The Ap. Dh. S. contains a very elaborate 
treatment of honouring guests ( II. 3. 6. 3 to II. 4. 9. 6 ). Gaut. 
V. 36, Manu III. 102-103 and Yaj. 1. 107 and 111 state that he 
is called an atithi who belonging to a different village and 
intending to stay one night only arrives in the evening, that 
one who has already been invited for dinner is not an atithi 
properly so called, that a person who belongs to the same 
village or who is a friend or fellow-student is not an atithi, 
that one has to honour guests according to one's ability, that 
guests are to be preferred according to the order of varnas and 
that among the brahmanas, the srotriya and one who has com- 
pletely mastered (at least one) recension of the Veda Is to be 
preferred. Vas. Dh. S. XL 6 says that the worthiest are to be 
honoured first. Gaut. V. 39-42 and Manu III. 110-112 say 
that a ksatriya is not really an atithi to a brahmana nor 
are vaisyas nor sudras; but they add that, 179 ' if a ksatriya 
comes to a brahmana's house as a guest ( i. e. as a traveller 
who has no food with him and about the time of taking food ) 
be should be treated to a meal after brahmana guests take 
their food and valsya and sudra guests should be given food

by a brshmana householder along with his servants and thereby 
he should show his kindliness. Ap. Dh. S. II, 4. 9. 5 requires 
the householder to give food to all who oome at the end of the 
Vaisvadeva, even including cand&las, but it mentions the view 
of some that one need not give food to unworthy persons (vide 
note 1779 above ). Commentators like Haradatta explain that« 
in the oase of worthy guests, if the householder does not give 
food, though able, he incurs sin; but in the case of unworthy 
people he incurs no blemish by not giving, but if he gives 
to them also, he secures merit. Vrddha-Gautama (pp. 535-536) 
calls upon a householder to treat even a candala with consi- 
deration. Par&sara ( I. 40 ) and Satatapa went so f ar ,m as to 
say that even if a householder hates a visitor or the latter is a 
fool, the householder should give him food if he arrives at the 
time of meals. Santiparva 146. 5 says that even an enemy 
when he comes to one's house as a guest must be hospitably 
treated, as a tree does not remove its shade from one who 
approaches it to fell it. But Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 19, Manu 

IV. 213, Yaj. I. 162 are opposed to this and state that a guest 
who is at enmity with the host shall not eat his food, nor shall 
he eat the food of a host who accuses him or suspects him of a 
crime. Vrddha-HSrlta ( 8. 239-240 ) states the humane rule * if 
a traveller is a sudra or belongs to a pratiloma caste ( such as a 
candala) and comes to one's house tired and hungry, the 
householder should give him food; but if a heretic or a patita 
(one outcast for grave sins) comes in that condition, one 
should not give him cooked food, but only grain. Compare 
Manu IV. 30. Vrddha-Gautama ( chap. 6, p. 535 and chap. 12, 
p. 590, Jivananda part 2 ) says the same about a candala or 
svapaka being given cooked food. Baud. gr. II. 9. 21 enjoins 
welcome to all travellers including candalas. 

The guest is to be shown honour by going out to meet him t 
by offering him water to wash his feet, by giving him a seat, 
by lighting a lamp before him, by giving food and lodging, by 
personal attendance on him, by offering him a bed and by 
aocompanying him some distance when he departs. Vide Gaut. 

V. 29-34, 37, Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 7-15, Manu III. 99, 107 
and IV. 29, Daksa III. 5-8. Vanaparva 200. 22-25 and Anusasana 
2 highly extol hospitality. Anusasana 7. 6 says 'the host

should give his eye, mind and agreeable speech to the 
guest, he should personally attend on him and should accompany 
him when he (the guest) departs; this sacrifice demands 
these five fees'.'™ Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 4. 16-21) says that if 
a brahmana that has not studied the Veda or a ksatriya or 
a vaisya cornea as a guest to a brahmana, the latter should offer 
him a seat, water and food, but need not rise to receive him, 
that if a sudra comes as a guest to a brahmana, the latter should 
ask him to do some work, then give him food, but if he has 
none, he should send his slaves to bring it from the royal 
palace (or store-house). 179 * Haradatta makes the interesting 
remark that for honouring sudra visitors the king should set 
apart in each village some paddy or other corn. Gaut. V. 33, 
Manu III. 101 ( = Vanaparva II. 54 and Udyoga 36. 34), 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4. 13-14, Yaj. I. 107, Baud. gr. II. 9. 21-23 say 
that l,0 ° if a man has not the means to give food to all visitors 
he should at least offer them water, room and grass to lie down 
upon, and agreeable speech. If the householder is absent, his 
wife is to look after honouring guests. Gaut. ( V. 37-38 ) says 
that guests of the brahmana, ksatriya and vaisya castes should 
be respectively greeted with the words kuiala, anamaya and 
arogya and the sudra also with arogya. Vide Manu II. 127 
also and note 831 above. 

The motive of this injunction to honour guests was dear, 
viz. universal kindliness. Other motives were added by smrtis 
in order to emphasize the observance of this duty. The Ssh. gr. 
II. 17. 1 says " Even if a man constantly gathers grass ( i. e. 
maintains himself by collecting the grains that fall in a field 
when the crop is taken away ) and performs agnihotra, a brah- 
mana guest who stays in his house without receiving the 
honour ( due as a guest ) takes away the ( merit ) of all his good

works". ,80 ' Manu III. 100 says the same. Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 6 
says that by honouring guests one secures heaven and freedom 
from misfortune. 1808 Vide also Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 7. 16. One 
yerse quoted in numerous works like the Visnu Dh. 8. 67. 33, 
SSntiparva 191. 12, VisnupurSna III. 9. 15, MSrkandeya 29. 31, 
Brahmapurana 114. 36 is 'when a guest returns from the house 
of a person with his hope of getting food shattered, he (the guest) 
transfers his own sins to the householder and departs taking 
with him the householder's merit (punya)'. The Vayupurana 
,.(71. 74) and Brhat-Parasara ( Jivananda, part 2, p. 99) say that 
yogins and siddhas (those who have attained transcendant 
powers ) wander ever this earth in various forms for the benefit 
of men; therefore one should with folded hands welcome a 
guest.- If one is not able to feed many guests, then Baud. Dh. 
S. (II. 3. 15-18) declares that one should feed him who is 
endowed with superior qualities or who is the first to arrive or 
who is a irotriya. 

'Parfisara. (I. 46-47) says that the brahmacarin and the 
ascetic are the masters of food (i. e. their claim is the first); 
if one eats without giving to these one should perform the 
penance of candrayana. When a yati comes as a guest, one 
should give water in his hand, then food and then again water. 
The food becomes as big as Meru ( mountain ) and the water as 
the sea. Laghu-Visnu ( II. 12-14 ) highly eulogises a yogin as 
a guest and Daksa VII. 42-44 and Vrddha-HSrlta 8. 89 say 
that if a yati stays as a guest in a householder's house for a 
single night, the Matter's accumulated sins are destroyed and 
when a yati takes food at a man's house it is Visnu himself 
who is fed.' 803 

If after some guests have been fed another guest or a batch 
of guests arrives, then the householder should have food cooked

again, but in such a case no fresh vaisvadova and baliharana 
are necessary. Vide Manu III. 105 and 108. It has been 
already shown from the Satapatha that the householder is 
not to partake of meals before the guests, but rather after 
the guests. The Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 7. 3 states 180 * 'he who eats 
before his guest . eats .( destroys ) food, prosperity, progeny, 
cattle and merit of his own house '. Manu III. 114 ( = Visnu 
Dh. S. 67. 39 ) allows the householder to feed newly married 
girls ( his daughters or sisters ), unmarried girls, persons 
who are ill, and pregnant women even before guests; 
while Gautama V. 23 says that these should be fed at the 
same time as the guests. Manu III. 113, 116-118, Visnu Dh. S. 
67. 38-43, Yaj. 1. 105, 108, Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 10 ,' 805 Baud- 
Dh. S. II. 3. 19 say that one should feed one's friends, relatives 
and one's servants and then the householder and his wife 
should dine, that one should not stint one's servants and 
slaves ( who are to be fed daily with food ) in order to be able to 
feed guests, that he who eats before these ( guests, relatives, 
young women of the house, servants) will have his soul 
harassed by vultures after death, that he who cooks food for 
himself only swallows merely sin and that when he eats what 
remains after offering yajna to gods, beings, pitrs and guests, 
he really eats. Manu III. 285 ( = VanaparvaII.60) says that 
' vighasa is what is left after brahmanas and guests have 
partaken and amrta is what is left after being offered in sacrifice 
and one should always eat these.' Baud. Dh. S. (II. 3. 68 and 
21-22 ) says 1808 " all beings subsist on food, the Veda declares 

• food is life ' ; therefore food should be given, as food is the 
highest offering. One should not take food without giving it 
to others " and quotes two verses said to have been sung by 
food itself. It is on account of these sentiments that are 
ingrained even to-day in the minds of all Hindus that no Poor 
Law and no work-houses were required in India. This senti- 
ment undoubtedly leads to abuses, but what system is not

without abuses ? The Poor Law and work-houses have their 
own abuses and the general tax-payer has probably to pay 
more for relief to the poor, the destitute and unemployed in 
England than under the Indian system of feeding the poor 
voluntarily. 

Ap. Dh. S. (IL 4. 9. 2-4) says" 07 that when the guest 
departs, the host should accompany him to the place where his 
conveyance is drawn up and if he has no conveyance, then till 
the guest gives him leave to go or if the guest forgets to give 
leave, the host should turn back from the boundary. Vas. Dh. 
S. XI. 15 and Yaj. 1. 113 speak also of accompanying the guest 
till the boundary, and Apararka explains that the boundary 
may be that of the host's house site, or of his field or^ of the 
village according to the eminence of the guest. Sankha- 
Likhita 1808 prescribe that the host should accompany the guest 
till he reaohes a public garden or public hall, a prapa (place 
where water is distributed gratis ), a tank, a temple, a sacred 
(or big) tree (like the fig tree) or a river and then should go 
round the guest and say the words 'farewell till we see each 
other again. ' It is in accordance with this that in the fourth 
Act of the Sakuntala Kanva's pupil reminds his teacher that 
one should accompany one's dear relative up to some reservoir 
of water.

CHAPTER XXII 

BHOJANA 

Bhojana ( taking erne's meals ) : — Daksa ( II. 56 and 68 ) states 
that in the fifth 180 ' part of the day the householder should 
make according to his capacity the gods, pitrs, men and even 
lower animals (lit. insects) participators (in food) and after 
doing that, he should himself partake of the remainder of the 
food cooked. Thus he was to take his meals during one 
hour and a half after noon. Bhojana is one of the most important 
subjects treated of in Dharmasastra works and the greatest 
importance (next to rules about marriage) attaches to the 
numerous injunctions and taboos about food. The principal 
subjects to be dealt with under this head are : how many times 
food was to be taken; the kinds of foods and drinks allowed or 
forbidden; what causes food defilement; flesh-eating and drink- 
ing wine; whose food was to be eaten; etiquette and ceremonies 
before taking food, at the time of taking it and after taking it. 

Great importance was attached to purity of food from very 
ancient times. In the Chandogya Up. ( VII. 26. 2 ) occurs this 
passage * when there is purity of food, then the mind becomes 
pure, when the mind is pure then follows firm remembrance ( of 
the real Self), when the last is secured all knots (that bind the 
soul to the world ) are loosened. " 8I ° 

The several matters about bhojana found in the Vedic 
literature will be first briefly set out. From Rg. VI. 30. 3 it 

appears that food was taken, while sitting ( 'the mountains sank

down just as men sit down to take food ' ). 'A person was to 

take food 18 " only twice a day* says the Tai. Br. I. 4. 9. and 

the Sat. Br. II. 4. 2. 6. There were certain taboos about articles 

of food even in the earliest texts. Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 1 states that 

all red exudations (resins) of trees or the juice that oozes out 

from trees when they are cut ( with an axe &c. ) should not be 

eaten, since that colour is due to the ( sharing of ) brahmana- 

murder. Similarly the milk of the cow was not to be drunk for 

ten days afteT delivery (Tai Br. II. 1. 1, III. 1. 3). The Ait.Br. 6. 9 

states that one should not eat the food of a diksita ( one initiated 

for a Vedic sacrifice) till the performance of vapahoma by him. 

Rg. 1. 187 ( vv. 1-7 ) is a hymn in praise of food. The story of 

Usasti Cakrayana in the Ohandogya Up. shows that in a dire 

calamity when no food can be had, one may eat anything, 

even the remnants of another's food and the Vedantasutra 

(HI. 4. 28-31, sarvannanumatis-ca pranatyaye tad-darsanat ) is 

based on this episode in the Chandogya. In the Ait. Ar. 

V. 3. 3 ,8W it is stated that ' one who knows this ( i. e. the 

Mahavrata) should not recite these texts before one who knows 

it not nor dine with him nor should he take delight in his 

company. ' The sages are said in the Kausltaki Br. ( 12. 3 ) to 

have told Kavasa who sat in their midst that they would not 

eat with him as he was the son of a deist. The question about 

flesh-eating and drinking spirituous liquors will be dealt with 

in detail later. 

Manu V. 4 declared that death overtakes brahmanas on 
account of four causes, viz. absence of Vedic study, giving up 
the performance of proper duties and aotions, laziness and 
blemishes attaching to the food taken. The Gr. R. p. 347 quotes 
verses to the effect ' food is the filth of men, everything is 
centred in food, the evil deeds of men resort to their food. Who- 
ever eats the food of another partakes of that man's sin. ' There- 
fore elaborate regulations are laid down about everything 
relating to food. Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 1, Vas. Dh. S. XII. 18. 
Visnu Dh. S. 68. 40, Manu II. 5 say that one should face the 
east when taking food and the Visnu Dh. S. 68. 41 and Ap. Dh.

S. II. 8. 19. 1-2 allow a man to face the south, except when 
the diner's mother is alive. Manu II. 52 ( = Anusasanaparva 
104. 57) states 'one facing the east eats food which tends 
to long life, one facing the south eats food which 
leads to fame, one facing the west eats ( so as to produce ) 
wealth and one facing north partakes of truth.' This means 
that one who eats facing any one of these directions secures 
the benefit specified. The Vamanapurana and Visnupurana 
quoted in Gr. R. p. 312 disallow the south and west. One must 
take one's meals in private in a place screened from public 
view. The Sm. 0. quotes 1813 verses of Devala, Usanas and the 
Padmapurana to the effect ' one should take food in privacy, for 
one who does so is endowed with wealth and one who eats his 
meals in public becomes bereft of wealth; one should not eat in 
the sight of many ( who are themselves not eating) and many 
men should not eat before a single person who is only looking 
at them'. One may 1814 eat in the company of one's sons, 
younger brothers, dependents &c. Some writers went so far 
as 18 " to recommend that 'one should take one's food alone and 
not in the company of even one's relatives or other brahmanas, 
since who oan know the secret sins a person in whose company 
one eats is guilty of ' ? The conception underlying this unchari- 
table view was stated by Brhaspati to be that ' when several 
persons sit down to dinner in a continuous row, the sins one 
of them is guilty of attach to the others in the same row'. 
Even in modern times many persons in Northern India follow 
this view and it is a well-known proverb that nine bhayyas have 
ten hearths. The place where one takes one's food should 
be freshly cowdunged and pure. Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 5. 17. 6-8 ) 
says that one should not take one's food in a boat nor 
on' a wooden platform, but may do so on a pure floor. One 
was not to eat while seated on an elephant, or horse or camel

or in some conveyance, or in a cemetery or in a temple or 
on a bed or chair ; nor should one eat food placed on one's 
palm ( Brahmapurana quoted in Gr. B. p. 325 ). One should 
wash one's hands and feet before sitting down to take one's 
meal. Manu IV. 76 says ( = Anusasana 104. 61-62 and Atri 
in Jivananda, part 1, p. 9) that one should begin one's 
dinner while one's feet are wet, since that leads on to long 
life. Vyasa quoted in Sm. C. ( I. p. 221 ) prescribes that one 
should have five limbs wet at the time of taking food, viz. 
the hands, the feet and the mouth. ,816 All writers prescribe 
that one should observe silence or at least restraint of speech at 
the time of meals ( e. g. vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 7. 2, Lagbu-Harlta 
40 ). Vrddha-Manu quoted by the Sm. C. I. p. 223 wn requires 
complete silence till five morsels are taken and restraint in 
speeoh thereafter. Following the Vedic injunctions quoted 
above, Gaut. IX. 59, Baud. Dh. S. II. 7. 36, Manu II. 56, Sam- 
varta 12 and others say that a householder should take only two 
meals every day, should not eat food in tbe intervening period 
and that if he acts up to this advice he reaps the merit of a fast. 
Gobhila-smrti ( II. 33 ) says the same and adds I818 that the 
evening meal may be taken till one prahara and a half ( i. e. 
4$ hours ) after nightfall. One was not to eat very early in the 
morning nor at midnight nor at twilight ( Manu IV. 55 and 62 
and Visnu Dh. S. 68. 48 ). Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 8. 19. 10 ) allows 
partaking of roots and fruits between two meals. Below the 
vessel or plate or leaf from which one eats, one has to draw a 
figure with water or holy ashes. According to the Brahmapurana 
( quoted in Gr. R. p. 311 ) the mandalas ( figures ) for brahmanas, 
ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras should respectively be in the form 
of a square, a triangle, a circle and a crescent ; while according 
toSankha(in Sm. C. I., p. 221), Laghu-Satatapa 133, Atri 
( Jivananda chap. V. 1, p. 7 ) in the case of the sudra water is to

be sprinkled on the ground below his plate. The reasons for 
drawing a mandala are stated by these authorities to be that the 
Adityas, Vasus, Budras, Brahma and other gods partake of only 
that food which is offered after a mandala is made and that 
evil spirits and goblins carry away the flavour of the food 
when no mandala is made. The person taking his food should 
sit on a low wooden stool having four feet or on a seat made 
of wool or of the skin of a goat ( which latter is said to be 
the best by Ap. Dh. S. II. 8. 19. 1). One should not sit 
on a seat of oowdung cakes ( dried ), or of clay, or of the 'leaves 
of asvattha or palasa or arka plant or a seat made by joining 
two planks together or on a shattered one or partly burnt one or 
on one made fast with iron (nails). Vide Smrtyarthasara 
p. 69. The vessel or plate from which one is to eat is to be 
plaoed on the mandala drawn on the ground. The vessel from 
which to eat may be of gold, silver, copper, lotus or palasa 
leaves (vide Veda-Vyasa III. 67-68, Paithlnasi quoted in 
Ahnika-prakasa p. 467 ). A copper vessel is forbidden to house- 
holders who should use bell-metal (kamsya) vessel. Ap. Dh. 
S. ( II. 8. 19. 3 ) says that a copper plate with gold in the 
centre 18 " is recommended. But a bronze plate for eating from, 
tambula and a luxurious bath with oil &c, were not allowed to 
an ascetic, a brahmacarin and a widow. 18 * Harlta ( quoted by 
Sm. 0. I. p. 222 ) stated that one was not to eat in an iron or 
earthern vessel, but Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 5. 17. 9-12 ) ,M1 prescribes that 
an earthen vessel not used for cooking may be used as a plate 
for meals, but if it had been used for cooking food, then it may 
be used as a plate for food after being baked in fire, that an 
iron plate sooured with ashes is pure and even a wooden plate 
may be used provided it is thoroughly soraped from inside. Manu 
IV. 65 states that one should not eat from a broken vessel, but 
Paithlnasi remarks that there is nothing wrong in eating from 
a broken plate made of copper, silver, gold, conoh-shell, or 
stone. ,m Some smrtis forbade lotus or palasa leaves, but the

Ahnlka-prakasa p. 467 explains that this prohibition holds good 
only if the lotus plant grows on dry land ( and not in a pond 
or the like) or when the palasa is a young plant. Paithlnasi 
( in Sm. C. I. p. 222 ) presoribes that one who desires wealth 
should not eat on a plate made of the leaves of the vata, arka, 
asvattha, kumbhl, tinduka, kovidara and karanja trees. Vrddha- 
Harlta 8. 250-256 prescribes that the plate may be of gold, 
silver or bronze or any leaf allowed by sastras, that leaves of 
palasa and lotus are not to be used by householders but may be 
used by ascetics, forest hermits and in sraddhas and sets out 
leaves forbidden and allowed. Even now in modern times 
people prefer (particularly in oaste dinners and marriages) plan- 
tain leaves for dining or silver vessels for honoured guests and 
brahmanas at sr&ddha or use plates prepared from stitched 
leaves of various trees. Before sitting down to take one's food, 
one has to perform acamana ( twice ) outside the place where 
one is to eat and has to perform acamana after taking his 
meals. This practice was most ancient, as it is attested by the 
Chandogya Up. V. 2. 2 ,8M and the Br. Up. VI. 1. 14. The rule 
is laid down by Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 16. 9, ,8!W Manu II. 53, V. 138 
and others also. Vide Devala (quoted in the Smrtimukt&phala, 
fthnika, p. 418) for acamana outside the room for meals. When 
sitting down to eat a person must wear his saored thread in 
the upavlta form (Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1) and must also have an 
upper garment, 1885 but should not cover his head ( Manu IV. 45 
III. 238, Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4. 22-23 and II. 8. 19. 12). A darvi 
(ladle or spoon) is to be employed in serving ghee, oil, cooked 
food, all condiments, salt ( i. e. these should not be served by 
the bare hand ) but pot in giving water or uncooked food ( vide 
Sm. 0. 1, p. 223 quoting several smrtis). The householder may 
wear in his hand gold or jewel (ring &c.) at the time of meals. 
Gaut. IX. 59, Vas. Dh. S. III. 69, Manu II. 5-' -55 say that 
when food is brought to be served, the person about to eat it 
should greet it, should pay honour to it, show his delight at it 
and should not find fault with it. Vas. Dh. S. ( III. 69-71 )

says "he should honour food in the morning and evening by 
saying ' I like it \ by saying ' it was good for eating * in the 
case of food served in sraddhas and ' it was perfect ' as to food 
offered in abhyudayika rites 18 " (i. e. in marriage &c). Kulluka 
( on Manu IF. 54 ) and the Gr. R. ( p. 314 ) quote verses of the 
Adipurana ( Brahmapurana in Gr. R. ) to the effect that on 
seeing food one should fold one's hands and should bow to it 
saying ' may this always be ours * and that God Visnu himself 
said that whoever honours food honours him. After the 
food is served on the plate or dish, the eater should 
sprinkle water round it and say 'I sprinkle thee that 
art satya ( truth ) with rta ( right order ) * ( in the morn- 
ing ) and ' I sprinkle thee that art rta with satya ' ( in 
the evening ). 18M According to some he then offers to the right 
of the plate or dish on the ground a little of the food 
in his plate from the west towards the east to Dharmaraja 
( i. e. Yama ), Citragupta and pretas ( vide Bhavisyapurana 
quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 224 and Ahnikaprakasa p. 465 ).'"• 
Others say that these balls are offered to bhupati, bhuvanapati 
and bhUtanam pati, while in modern times they are offered 
to Citra, Citragupta, Yama, Yamaduta ( and some add a fifth 
'sarvebhyo bhutebhyah svaha). He should then sip a little water 
with the words ' thou art the seat of ambrosia ( amrtopastara- 
nam-asi ) and at the end of the meal the words used are ' thou 
art the cover of ambrosia ' ( amrtapidhanam-asi ). All this has 
been prescribed from very ancient times and has continued to 
this day. Yaj. 1. 106 calls this sipping of water aposana ( tak- 
ing in of water ) and its purpose is to make food beneficial like 
amrta ( nectar ) and to cover it as if with a garment. He then 
offers five morsels on which ghee is sprinkled to the five modes

of prSpa preoeded by the word ,x om ' and mt followed by 
' svaha '. These five pravMhutis are mentioned in the ChSndogya 
Up. V. 19-23, where prSnas are enumerated in the order pr8na» 
vyana, apana, saraana and udana. The Vedantasutra III. 3. 
40-41 explains that the Chandogya passage applies only when 
one sits down to dinner and not when one goes without it- 
Medieval digests quoting Brhat-Parasara added a sixth offering 
to Brahman after the pranahutis and this is done in modern 
times. While the ahutis to prfina are being offered complete 
silence ( absence of all sound including even 'hum') is to be 
observed. Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 7. 6 ) insists on complete silence 
throughout the meal and if one speaks, one has to mutter the 
words ' Om bhur bhuvah svar-om ' and then eat further on. 
Others allow speech after pranahutis for refusing food or condi- 
ments or for dharma. Vide Sm. M., ahnika p. 423 whioh 
quotes Sandilya that ' silence is not neoessary at meals for 
householders and one should show one's solicitude for those who 
dine with one by talking to them.' Saunaka quoted by Sm. C. I., 
p. 223, Vrddha-HSrlta 8. 263-265 dilate upon the different fingers 
of the hand that are to be employed in taking the five ahutis to 
the life breaths while the Bhojana-sutra says that according to 
Baudhayana all ahutis were to be offered with all the fingers- 
H&rlta quoted in the Sm. G. I. p. 226 states that marjcma, offering 
bali, worship and eating should be done with the tips of fingers. 
The plate or vessel is to be throughout kept on the ground at a 
sraddha dinner and the thumb and the next two fingers of the 
left hand may be used for holding the plate or plantain leaf in 
position, but if the house is full of people and it is likely that 
dust may be raised by their feet or by their clothes, then a 
person taking his meal may raise up his plate from the ground 
with his left hand after he has taken five morsels.' 8 * The

each morsel in bis mouth with all the fingers including the 
thumb,' 8 * 1 he is not to ware his hand. Various rules are laid 
down in the VisnupurSna ( III. 11. 83-84 ) and Brahmapurana 
( quoted in Gr. B. p. 224 ) as to the order in which various 
articles are to be eaten, viz. first sweet liquid food may be taken, 
then salted and sour, and then pungent and bitter, the last item 
should be milk and after that one should not take ourds ; a 
householder should always take food mixed with ghee. One is 
not to cut off portions of food or cakes, roots, bulbs, fruits or 
flesh with the teeth and then eat them ( Baud. Dh. S. IL 7. 10 ). 
Some smrtis presoribe that while taking each morsel one should 
say U8B ' Govinda '. At the time of eating, several postures are 
forbidden, viz. one should not stretch one's feet or place them 
on another seat ( a footstool &o.) nor should one have one's 
haunches and knees tied by a garment (Visnu Dh. S. 
68. 40) nor should one place one's hand on one's left 
foot, nor should one wear one's shoes or wooden sandals, nor 
should one come in contact with leather ( vide Sinrtimuktaphala, 
ahnika p. 425 ). Baud. Dh. S. ( I. 1. 21 ) states that among usages 
peculiar to the south were those of eating in the company 
of one whose upanayana had not been performed or of one's 
wife or taking stale food. But Baud, disapproved of these. 
Manu IV. 43, Visnu Dh. S. 68. 46 and Vas. Dh. S. XII. 31 I$M 
say that one should not eat together with one's wife and Vas> 
Dh. S. adds the reason that by so doing the child born has no 
strength as stated in the Sat. Br. X. 5. 2. 9. Kulluka and some 
other commentators on Manu IV. 43 hold that the prohibition 
relates to eating in the same dish with one's wife, while, as 
Medhatithi states, others hold that it applies also to eating with 
one's wife at the same time and place. The Sm. C. ( I. p. 227 ) 
and other digests quote a smrti verse which allows a brahmana 
to eat in the same dish with his brahmana wife and explain 
the verse as applying to a brahmana who is on a journey. The

?66 History of Dharmaiaslra [ Ch. XXII 

Smrtyarthas&ra (p. 69 ) says that one can eat in the same 
dish with one's wife at the time of marriage. The Mit. on 
Yaj. 1. 131 says the same. 

Various rules are laid down as to how much one is to eat. 
Two famous verses quoted by Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 13, Vas. Dh. S» 
VI. 20-21 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 7. 31-32 are ' an asoetio should 
eat eight morsels, 18 ** a forest hermit 16, a householder 32 and 
a Vedic student an unlimited number. One who has conse- 
crated the Vedio fires, a draught ox and a brahmacarin are able 
to perform their work by eating, they cannot perform work 
when they do not eat \ Wi Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 12 expressly 
direots that a householder should not stint himself as to food> 
so that he may be able to properly perform his work. Haradatta 
explains that the general rule laid down by Ap. Db. S. itself 
( II. 1. 1. 2 ) that one should take only two meals a day does 
not apply to one who has conseorated the Vedio fires. Baud. 
Dh. S. II. 7. 33-34 goes further 188 * and says that if a house- 
holder ( who is ahitUgni ) and a Vedio student practise austeri- 
ties by observing a fast they are guilty of sin, beoause they 
thereby cause oessation of agrdkotra to the life-breaths. But 
there is no sin if a fast is observed by these as a penance for 
some lapse. Sahara on Jaimini V. 1. 20 ( p. 1301 ) appears to 
favour the idea that an ahitagni may eat several 1887 times a day. 

One was to occupy the first seat in a row at a dinner only 
if specially requested to do so, but when thus seated on the first 
seat, one should not begin to eat food before others, but after 
them (Sankha quoted by AparSrka p. 150). While several 
br&hmanas are taking their meal in a continuous row, if one 
of them takes aoamana 1888 before the others, or gives the

remains of bis food to the pupil or gets up, the others should 
leave eating the food in their disbes and also get up and the 
br&hmana who thus prematurely gets up is called a brahmahd, 
( a murderer of a brahmana or brahmakantaka ). These rules 
are quoted in the Sm. C. ( I. p. 227 ), Or. R. p. 331, Srartimukta- 
pbala ( abnika p. 427 ). In order to avoid this awkward position 
various devices were employed. A pankti ( row of diners ) 
ceased to be a continuous line if two diners were separated 
from each other by fire, by ashes, by a pillar, a passage, or a 
door or by the ground being of a lower level. Apararka (p. 476 ) 
quotes Brhaspati that even if persons are seated in one row, but 
they are separated from each other by ( streaks of ) ashes and 
they do not touch each other, then there is no intermingling 
( i. e. persons of different castes also may sit in a row being 
separated by a streak of ashes &c. ). Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 17. 2 says 
that one should not sit down to dinner in the same row with 
undeserving persons (by reason of birth, character or learning ). 

At p. 100 above it has been stated how brahmanas 
following several occupations that were deemed low were not 
invited at sraddhas. Gaut. ,8J8a XV. 28-29, Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 2, 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 21-22, Vas. Dh. S. III. 19, Visnu 83. 2-21, 
Manu III. 184-186, Sankha (in verse) 14. 1-8, Anusasanaparva 
90, 34, the Vayu ( chap. 79 and 83, Anand. ed. ) and several 
other puranas contain long lists of those brahmanas who 
sanctify the company of diners when they sit down for dinner 
( they are pankti-pavanas ) and of those who defile the company 
of diners by their presence in the row of diners (they are pankti-

explained by the commentators. sqsHrft^i' or-fl-prir is one who chants, 
according to Haradatta, *udu tyam' (Bg. I. 50. 1. ) and ' citram' (Eg. L 
115. 1), which constitute a sSman of the TalavakSras, while the 
Chandogas bold it to be a different sffman ; MedhStithi on Manu III. 
185 says they are the sSmans called Jye^thadohas. The NKciketa fire 
is described in Tai. Br. III. 11. 7 and 8, and Kathopanif&d 1. 1. 17-18. 
Bg. I. 91. 6-8 contain the word 'madhu' at the beginning of each. 
So one who studies these three madhu verses may be called 'tri- 
madhu*. Or possibly there is a reference to the MadhuvidyS referred 
to in Sat Br. IV. 1. 5. 18 and Br. Up. II. 5. 16. According to Haradatta 
'Trisuparna' are either the three verses Bg.X. 114. 4-6 (ekah supar- 
nah &o. ) or the three anuv&kaa of the Tai. Ar. X. 48-50 ( brahmametn

dusakas). A panktipavana is one who knows the six angas 
of the Veda (vide note 775 above), who has studied the JyesthasS- 
man, who has kindled the Naciketa fire, who knows the three 
madhu verses, who has studied the texts called Trisuparna, who 
maintains the five fires (vide p. 679 above), who has taken the cere- 
monial bath after finishing vedic studies, who knows the Mantras 
and the Brahmana of his Veda, who has studied dharmasastra and 
who is the son of a woman married in the brahma form. Ap. Dh. 
8. adds ' one who has performed the four medhas ' ( Asvamedha, 
Sarvamedha, Purusamedha and Pitrmedha, according to 
Haradatta). Manu says that one who understands the mean- 
ing of the Veda, one who expounds the Veda, a brahmacarin, 
one who is a liberal donor (lit. one who gives a thousand oows), 
one who has reached the age of one hundred are all pankti- 
pavanos. Sankha states that one who is devoted to Yoga, one 
who regards gold and a clod of earth as equal, an ascetic given 
to contemplation are all panktipSvanas. AnusSsana 90. 34 and 
Vayu 83, 52-55 include those who study the bhasyas, those 
who are devoted to grammar, those who study the puranas 
among pahkti-pavanas. Among those who defile company 
are one suffering from leprosy, "a bald man, one who is guilty 
of adultery, who is the son of a brahmana following the profes- 
sion of arms (Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17. 21); those who engage in 
sots not fit for brahmanas, those who are cunning, those who 
have deficient or excessive limbs, those who have abandoned 
Veda, the sacred fires and their parents or gurus, those who 
subsist on food given by sudras (Sankha XIV. 2-4). Vide 
Apararka pp. 453-455 for quotations on those who defile 
company. 

When there was a row of diners, all were to be served the 
same food and no difference was to be made between one man and 
another and if a difference were made a penance was prescribed as 
if he had committed brahmana murder. ,8M If while dining one 
brahmana touches another, he should give up eating or after finish- 
ing bis meal he should mutter the Gsyatrl verse 108 times ( as 
penance). In modern times generally the eyes are touohed with 
water if this happens. If a diner touched a server who had 
a vessel containing food, the server should place the vessel con-

tsinlng food on the ground, should perform aeamana, the food 
in the vessel should have water sprinkled over it and then 
it may be served. One was not to eat or drink with the left 
hand. One should drink water at the time of meals with a 
drinking bowl or vessel, one should never drink water with the 
two hands joined together ( Ysj. I. 138), but when not eating 
food one may drink water with the bare right hand. After 
finishing one's meal one is to repeat the aposana ' amrtapidha- 
nam-asi ' and drink some water, wash one's hands, sip 
water twice and may lightly brush his teeth for removing 
particles of food, then sip water again and take tambula. 1 * 10 
Asvalayana ( in verse ) recommends 16 mouthfuls of water 
( gandusa ) for cleansing the mouth after dinner ( Ahn. Pr. 
p. 483 ). An ascetic, a Vedio student and a widow were not to 
partake of tambula. 

A person was not to eat everything in his plate ; he should 
leave some remnant lMI of food except of curds, honey, ghee, 
milk and saktu ( barley or barley flour ). What remains was to 
be given to one's wife, servant or slave ( Par. M. I. part 1, p. 
422 ). No one was to give the remnants of one's food to 
another nor to eat the remnants of another's food, except a ohild 
that might eat the remnants of the food of its parents and guru 
{vide Smrtimuktaphala, ahnika p. 431). Remnants of food 
were not to be given to a sudra unless he was one's dependent 
( Manu IV. 80, Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 25-26 ). Atri ( quoted in 
Sm. 0. I. p. 228 ) says that even on sipping water after dinner 
one remains impure till one's plate is removed, till the ground 
where the food was taken is cow-dunged, till after leaving his seat 
he moveB on the ground elsewhere. Vide also Ap. Dh. 8. II. 2 
4. 24. The plate of a brahmana may be removed by a brahmana 
( but not by any one else ) and the plates of the brahmanas invited 
at a sraddha repast were to be removed by the person who per- 
formed the sraddha or by his son or pupil, but not by one whose 
upanayana is not performed nor by the wife nor by any one 
else ( Laghu-Asvalayana 1. 165-166 ).

770 History of DharmaiSstra I Oh. XXII 

Most of the above rules may more or less be exemplified 
from the descriptions of the prooedure of eating set out in Baud. 
Db. S. II 7, from the Bhojanasutra of Katyayana for the 
followers of the white Yajurveda, from HSrlta quoted in the Gr. 
E. pp. 316-17 among the ancient writers and from the Smrtya- 
rthasara pp. 68-69 among the authors of digests. It is impossi- 
ble to set out any of them here for want of space, but an extract 
from the last work is given in the Appendix. 18 " 

There were certain rules about abstaining from food in the 

case of eclipses of the sun and the moon. They are set out in 

the Sm. 0. 1, pp. 228-329, the Smrtyarthasara (p. 69 ), Matsya- 

purana chap. 67, Apar&rka pp. 151, 427-430. During the period 

of eclipse one was not to eat anything. Not only so but for 4 

praharas ( i. e. 12 hours ) and 3 praharas ( i. e. 9 hours ) before 

the aotual eclipse of the sun and the moon respectively all 

are to avoid taking food, except children, very old men and 

persons who are ill. This rule was observed up till very recent 

times by roost people. When the eclipse begins one was to 

bathe and give gifts, perform tarpana or sraddha. Then one 

was to bathe after l8 * 2 the eclipse was over and take food. If 

the sun sets while still eclipsed, one should bathe the next day 

on seeing the sun and then take, food. If the moon rose eclipsed, 

one was not to eat anything during the day next to that on which 

the moon rises eclipsed. That these rules are ancient follows from 

the fact that some of them occur even in the Visnu Dh. S. An 

eclipse of the sun is desoribed even in the Rg.V.40.5-9 and it was 

supposed to be brought about by an asura. The Asura SvarbhSnu 

is said to have pierced the sun with darkness in the Eathaka S. 

XI. 5 and the Tai. S. IL 1. 2. 2; the Sfin. Br. 24. 3 and Tandya 

Br. ( IV. 5. 2, IV. 6. 13 ) speak of an eclipse. In the Atharva- 

veda 19. 9. 10 the Sun and Rahu are brought together. The 

Chandogya Up. VIII. 13. 1 states that the knowing self shakes 

off bis body when going to the world of Brahma like a horse 

shedding his hair or like the moon released from the mouth of 

Rahu. 

Visnu Dh. S. ( 68. 4-5 ) prescribes that a man was not to 
eat when a cow or a brahmana met with an accident or when 
the king was in distress ( or dead ).

The most elaborate rules are laid down about what food 
should or should not be eaten and from whom food may or may 
not be taken. These rules occur in most of the srartis. It 
would be impossible to do justice to all of them. The following 
smrtis deal with this matter at length. Gaut. 17, Ap. Db. S. I. 
5. 16. 17-1. 6. 19 ; Vas. Dh. S. 14, Manu VI. 207-223, Ysj. I. 
167-181. The Santiparva chapters 36 and 78, the Kurmapurana 

( uttarSrdha chap. 17 ), Padma ( Sdikhanda chap. 56 ), and several 

other puranas deal with this topic. Among the digests the Sm. 

C. II. pp. 418-429, the Gr. R. pp. 334-395, the Madanaparijata pp. 

337-343, the Smrtimukt&phala (Shnika pp. 433-451), the 

Ahnikaprakasa pp. 488-550 contain very exhaustive treatment. 

An attempt will be made to present the rules in an orderly 

manner. 

Apararka p. 241 quotes a passage from the Bhavisya- 
purana' 8 * 4 which states the various reasons for food being 
forbidden viz. jatidu§ta or svabhavadusta ( i. e. forbidden on 
aocount of its very nature ) such as garlic, leek, onion &o. ; 
kriyaduQta ( forbidden on account of certain actions done with 
reference to it ) such as oooked food served with the bare 
hand or seen by a patita ( outcast ), candalas, dogs &c, or 
because one in a row takes aoamana or rises before others ; 
kaladutfa ( forbidden because of the time that has elapsed or 
because of the inappropriateness of the time ) suoh as stale food 
or food eaten in eclipses or the milk of a oow before ten days 
have elapsed from delivery ; sathsargadutfa (spoilt by foul contact) 
such as what comes in contact with a dog or wine or garlic, or 
hair or insects &o. ; sahrllekha (what causes disgUBt to the mind) 
such as f seces &c. To those may be added rasadusta ( what 
has lost its flavour ) such as p&yasa or kslra on the same day ; 
partgrahadusta ( what is forbidden simply because it belongs to 
a particular individual such as patita). Apararka (p. 1157) 
says that oondemned food, partaking of which is an upapataka 
( a minor sin ), is of six kinds, viz. due to svabhava, kila, 
samparka (same as samsarga), kriya, bhava, and parigraha. 1 "*

juice whioh a man may feel to be forbidden to him because he 
believes it to be wine. According to Oaut. 17. 12 bhavadus^a 
means food offered with disrespect or which the eater comes to 
hate or becomes disgusted with. Haradatta on Gaut. 23. 23 
mentions fire of these varieties ( of AparSrka p. 1157 ) except 
bhavadusta."" 

Before proceeding further some remarks must be made 
about flesh-eating. In the Rg. frequent reference is made to 
the cooking of the flesh of the ox for offering to gods (particular- 
ly Indra ). For example, in Rg. X. 86. 14 Indra is made to 
say ' They cook for me 15 plus twenty oxen" ; vide Rg. X. 27. 2. 
In Rg. X. 91. 14 it is stated that for Agni were sacrificed 
horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows and rams. In Rg. VIII. 43. II 18 * 7 
Agni is Btyled ' one whose food is the ox and the barren cow. ' 
In Rg. X. 79. 6 it is suggested that the cow was cut up with a 
sword or axe. In the Rg. itself the cow is frequently called 
« aghnyS * ( vide Rg. 1. 164. 27 and 40, IV. 1. 6, V. 83. 8, VIII. 69. 
21, X. 87. 16 &c. ). The word 'aghnya' appears to mean 'one 
that does not deserve to be killed ' and the Nirukta (XI. 43 ) ,M8 
explains it in that way. It should be noted that that word 
occurs sometimes in apposition to ' dhenu * ( as in Rg. IV. 1.6, 
VIII. 69. 2 ). So it may be argued that in the times of the Rg. 
only barren oows if at all were killed for sacrifice or meat and 
oows yielding milk were held to be not fit for being killed. It 
is only in this way that one can explain the high praise 
bestowed on the cow in Rg. VI. 28. 1-8 and in Rg. VIIL 101. 
15 and 16 where the cow is described to be ' the mother of 
Rudras, the daughter of Vasus, the Bister of Adityas and the 
centre of nectar ' and the sage winds up by praying to the 
knowing man ' do not kill the cow, that is innocent and is 
Aditi herself. '"" In Rg. VIIL 101. 16. the cow is called 'devl'

Ch. XXII 1 Bhojana-sacredness of cow 773 

( goddesB ). It appears that the cow was being raised to the 
status of divinity and there was a great revulsion of feeling 
about the cow. The great usefulness of the oow and the oz 
for agricultural purposes, in the family economy and as means 
of exchange must have powerfully contributed to making the 
cow a divinity. In the grhya sutras ( like As v. I. 24. 25 ), Eg. 
VIII. 101. 15 is prescribed as the mantra when in the Madhu- 
parka ceremony the cow is let loose by the guest. The Artharva- 
veda ( XII. 4 ) fully reoognises the cult of the holiness of the 
cow. That the cow continued to be offered in sacrifices follows 
from several Br&hmana passages e. g. Tai. Br. III. 9. 8. In the 
Sat. Br. III. 1. 2. 21 it is stated that the great sage Yajnavalkya 
was wont to eat the meat of cows and oxen provided it was 
* arhsala MM0 ( tender ? ). The Ait. Br. ( 6. 8 ) ,M1 states that the 
horse, the or, the goat and ram are sacrificial animals while 
the kirhpurusa, gauramrga, gavaya, the camel and sarabha ( a 
mythical animal with eight feet ) were not sacrificial and their 
flesh should not be eaten. The Sat. Br. I. 2. 3. 9 contains a 
similar prohibition. The Sat. Br. XI. 7. 1. 3 declares that ' meat 
is the best kind of food. ' The work of Mr. L. L. Sundara Ram 
(Madras, 1927) on 'Cow Protection in India' oontains an 
exhaustive treatment of the subject from Vedic times and oites 
the attitude of other nations and religions towards cow-killing. 
The veneration for the cow has been so great that paficagavya 
prepared from the five substanoes due to the cow viz. her milk, 
ourds and ghee of her milk, her urine and dung mixed with 
water in which kusa blades had been placed was looked 
upon as ,m purification for many lapses. Yaj. III. 314 
mentions the ingredients of panoagavya. The Baud. gr. 
sesa-sutra ( II. 20 ) contains an elaborate note on the prepa- 
ration of paficagavya, the quantities of the five ingre- 
dients, the Vedio verses to be recited when preparing it.

Matsyapurana 267. 5-6 and other works contain similar rules. 
Par&sara prescribes that the urine, dung, milk, curds and ghee 
should be of cows the colours of which are respectively dark, 
white, copper-red, dark-red and brown or that all ingredients 
may be of a brown ( kapila ) cow. There is some difference 
of view about colours and also about the quantities. According 
to ParSsara urine, ghee, and water should be one part each, 
curds three parts, milk seven parts and oowdung as much as the 
thumb. Acoording to Atri. 299 dung, urine, ghee and milk 
were to be respectively 1, 2, 4 and 8 parts and curds also 8 
parts. When mixing the ingredients, urine is taken with the 
sacred GSyatrl, cowdung with ' gandhadvSram ' ( Tai. Ar. X. 1), 
milk with ' Spyayasva ' (Rg. I. 91. 16), curds with 'dadhikravno' 
( Rg. IV. 39. 6 ), ghee with ' tejosi sukram ' ( Vaj. S. 22. 1 ) and 
kusa water with ' devasyatvS* ( Ait. Br. 37. 3, Vaj. S. 22. 1 ). 
The paficagavya thus prepared is to be placed near the fire, then 
it is to be stirred to the accompaniment of ' Spo hi stha ( Rg. 
X 9. 1-3 ) and then the mantra ' ma nastoke ' ( Rg. 1. 111 8 ) 1b 
to be repeated over it, it may be then offered into fire with green 
darbhas not less than seven to the accompaniment of ' Ir&vatl ' 
( Rg. VII. 99. 3 ), ' idam Visnur ' ( Rg. I. 22. 17 ), ' ma nastoke ' 
(Rg. X. 114. 8), and the sarhvatl verse (Rg. X. 9. 4) and then the 
remainder is to be drunk by one who prepares it with the verse 
noted below. ,8!! The vessel in which the pancagavya is to be 
prepared must be of copper or gold or of palSsa or lotus leaves 
( Par. M. II. 1 p. 434 quoting Praj&pati ). Visnu Dh. 8. 54. 7 
and Atri 300 say that a sudra drinking paficagavya and a 
brfihmana drinking aura (liquor distilled from flour) are 
equally sinful and fall in hell. But Devala 61 and ParSsara 
XL 3 and 27 allow sudras ( and women ) to take paficagavya 
but without Vedio mantras. Therefore the digests like SQdra- 
kamalskara ( p. 42 ) say that a sudra can take paficagavya only 
as a prayas-citta (penance) for a sin and not otherwise. 
Paficagavya is also called brahmakurca. Atri 301 declares that 
the dung of a oow that eats unclean things is not to be employed 
for purification. A smrti passage deolares that he In whose 
house there is not even one cow with her oalf becomes devoid 
of all mangalas (auspioious things) and darkness does not

leave him. A cow was said to be holy in all limbs except her 
mouth (Medhatithi on Manu V. 128 quotes * gavo medhya 
mukhad-rte ' ) and so Manu V. 124 requires food smelt or licked 
by a cow to be purified. Manu XI. 79 says that if one sacrifices 
one's life in defence of brahmanas and cows one becomes free 
from the sin of even brahmana murder. Visnu Dh. 8. 16. 18 
deolares that even an untouchable ( bahya ) went to heaven by 
giving his life in defenoe of brahmanas, oows. women and 
children. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 3. 45 also. In Gaut. IX. 13-14 the 
cow is referred to as devata. As early as the 2nd oentury A.D. we 
have the collocation of the words * go-brahmanahita* (the welfare 
of cows and brahmanas) in an inscription of Rudradaman ( E. I. 
vol. VIII. p. 44 ). Vide Gupta inscriptions p. 89 ( for ' go- 
br&hmana-purogabbyah sarvaprajabhyah ). These words also 
ocour frequently in the Ramayana ( Balakanda 26. 5, Aranya 

23. 28 ) and in the Matsyapurana 104. 16. The Kapila ( brown) 
cow was said to be the most auspicious and meant for provi- 
ding milk for agnihotra and brahmanas, and the sudra who used 
its milk was deemed to go to hell (vide Vrddha-Gautama p. 568). 

In spite of the prevalence of animal sacrifices, there are 
already in the times of the Rg. traces of the conception that a 
devout offering of praise or of a fuel-stiok or of cooked food was 
as good as a more solemn sacrifice ( Rg. VIII. 19. 5, VIII. 

24. 20) and that oblations of food made to the accompaniment of 
heart-felt hymns become like bulls, oxen and cows in sacrifice."" 
These verses are quoted by the Asv. gr. S. (1. 1. 4) and explained 
( vide p. 677 above ). The Sat. Br. XI. 6. 1. 3 ,MS adumbrates the 
later doctrine that the eater of meat is eaten in the next birth 
by the animal killed. The OhSndogya Up. III. 17 regards that 
tapas, charity, straightforwardness, ahiinsa and speaking the 
truth are the fee ( of the symbolic sacrifice ). The same Up. 
( VIII. 15. 1 ) emphasizes that the wise man who has attained 
correct knowledge does not cause any injury to bhutas except in 
the case of sacred rites and reaches the world of brahma and 
does not return to safnsara. mt It appears that the causes that 
led on to the giving up of flesh at least by some people were

many, the foremost being the metaphysical conception that one 
Supreme Entity pervades the whole universe, that all life was 
one, and that even the meanest insect was a manifestation of 
the divine Essence and that philosophical truths would not 
dawn upon the man who was npt restrained, free from crude 
appetites and toad not universal kindliness and sympathy. 
Another motive for the insistence onahiihsa was probably the idea 
of defilement caused by eating flesh (vide note 1810 above about 
'ahSrasuddhi'). San^ha asks people to give up flesh, wine, onions 
and garlic because the body is built up on the food eaten. ,,ST The 
notion that the eater of flesh would be devoured by the eaten in 
the next birth*had nothing to do with the early" stages of the 
doctrine of ahifiua, though by Manu and others that notion was 
later on exploited to emphasize its importance. Further as the 
Aryans spread over middle, east and south India animal food be- 
came unnecessary owing to the climate and the abundance of corn 
and vegetables. Though opinions may differ as to the causes, it 
cannot be gainsaid that the phenomenon of the voluntary giving 
up of meat by vast populations in the continent of India, when 
their ancestors had been meat-eaters for ages, is unique in the 
history of the. whole world. IM * We shall find that even when the 
doctrines of karma and transmigration were in full swing, the 
taking of life for food and in sacrifice was allowed by all the 
ancient dharmasutras. Even the Ved&ntasutra ( III. 1. 25 ) does 
not admit that the killing of animals in sacrifice is impure. The 
Br. Up. whioh contains a full statement of the doctrine of 
transmigration ( VI. 2 ) recommends ( VI. 4. 18 ) to the man 
who desires that a learned son be born to him the cooking of a 
mess of the flesh of a bull or ox or of other flesh with rice and 
ghee. ,,w -Not only other animals, but even the cow, was on 
certain occasions killed according to the grhya and dharma 
sutras on several occasions e. g. (1) in sr&ddhas ( Ap. Dh. S. II. 
7. 16. 25 ), (2) for a distinguished guest in Madhuparka ( Asv. 
gr. I. 24. 22-26, Vas. Dh. S. IV. 8 ), (3) in the As^aks sr&ddha

influenced by the ideas of karma and transmigration.

the Sulagava sacrifice ( Asv. gr. IV. 9. 10 ). 

In th,e Dharmasutras numerous rules are given about 
the flesh of beasts and birds and about fishes. Gaut. 17. 27-31, 
Ap. Dh. 8. I. 5. 17. 35, Vas. Dh. 8. 14. 39-40, Yaj. 1. 177, Visnu 
Dh. 8. 51. 6, Sahkha (quoted by Apararka p. 1167), Rama- 
yana ( Kiakindha 17. 39 ), Markandeya-purana ( 35. 2-4 ) 
prescribe that one should avoid the flesh of all five-nailed 
animals except mo of porcupine, hare, svauidh ( a boar or hedge- 
hog ), iguana, rhinoceros and tortoise ( some of these works omit 
the rhinooeros ). Gautama adds that one should also avoid the 
flesh of all animals with two rows of teeth in the two jaws, of 
hairy animals, of hairless animals (like snakes), of village cooks 
and hogs and of cows and bulls. Ap. Dh. 8. I. 5. 17. 29-31 
first forbids the flesh of animals with one hoof only, of oamels, 
of gavaya ( Gayal ), of the village hog, of the sarabha and of 
cows, but adds the exception that the flesh of milch cows and 
of bulls may be eaten as the Vajasaneyaka deolares the flesh of 
these to be pure. Ap. Dh. 8. ( II. 2. 5. 15 ) forbids the use of 
flesh to a teacher of the Veda in the months from upQkarma to 
utsarjana. This shows that even brahmanas who alone would 
ordinarily be teachers could take meat in the other months of 
the year. Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 3. 11. 4 deolares that a student had not 
to observe anadhyaya if he ate stale food or uncooked flesh, 
Ap. Dh. 8. II. 3. 7. 4 says that if flesh was offered to a guest, the 
merit was equal to the performance of the Dvadasaha sacrifice. 
The Mahabhasya of Patanjali ( vol. III. p. 320 ) states that the 
precept ' a village cock or hog is not fit to be eaten leads to the 
inference that a town hog also is unfit food as meat.' Vas. 
Dh. 8. XI. 34 1MI goes so far as to say that if an ascetio does 
not partake of flesh when requested to do so in a sraddha or 
in a rite for the gods he falls into hell for numberless years. 
Gradually, however, a change came over the sentiments of 
the people. Megasthenes (p. 99) and Strabo (XVI. 1. 59) 
state that the first caste of philosophers which is divided into 
two sub-divisions, viz. Braohmanes and Sarmanes ( sramanas )

abstained from animal food and sexual intercourse ( probably 
as brahmac&rins) and that after living in this manner for 
37 years they began to live with less restraint and began to eat 
the flesh of animals, particularly of those that did not, assist 
man in his labour. The Great Emperor Asoka declares in his 
first Book Edict how originally thousands of animals were 
killed in the royal kitchens, how he then brought down the 
number to two peacocks and one deer daily and how he had 
resolved to discontinue the slaughter of even this limited 
ntimber thereafter. Vide also the 2nd and 4th Bock Edicts. 
In the fifth pillar edict ( Delhi-Topra ) the Emperor Asoka 
notes that when he had been twenty-six years on the throne 
he declared numerous animals ( such as parrots, maims, haihsas> 
cakravakas, tortoises, porcupines, fishes &c. ) to be avadhya 
( not to be killed ). The general rule as stated 1868 by Ap. Dh.. S. 
II. 2. 3. 12 and the Ramayana ( quoted above on p. 733 ) was 
that from that food that was either oooked or got ready for the 
daily meals of a householder, homa and bait were to be made. 
Ancient works spoke of meat offerings to gods and in madhu- 
parka and sraddha. Therefore some of the smrtis like those 
of Manu and Vasistha are in two minds about the use of 
flesh. Manu ( V. 27-44 ) at first contains a permission to kill 
animals only in madhuparka, in sacrifices 18 " and in rites for 
gods and manes and on no other ocoasion. Manu (V. 27 and 32) 
further says that no sin is incurred in flesh-eating when one's 
life is in danger ( owing to famine or disease ) and when a person 
partakes of the remnants of the flesh of an animal purchased by 
him or reared by him or flesh given by another out of what is 
prepared for offering to gods and manes. Yaj. 1. 179 is to the same 
effeot. Manu further clinches his exhortation not to eat animal 
food by ordaining that he who kills an animal except for the 
limited purposes stated above is himself killed for as many births 
as there are hair on the body of the slaughtered animal ( Visnu 
Dh. S. 51. 60 is also the same). Manu then goes on to declare 
( V. 40 and 44 = Visnu Dh. S. II. 63, 67 ) that herbs or plants, 
animals, trees ( of whioh sacrifioial posts are made ), lower 
animals, birds, that meet destruction for the sake of performing

sacrifices are born again in better forms ( of existence ) and. that 
himsa ( killing of or injury to sentient beings ) done according 
to the dictates of the Veda should be understood as no himsa™** 
since dharma shines forth from Veda alone. Though Vasistfia 
Dh. S. ( in 14. 39-40 ) allows the flesh of five five-nailed animals 
and of animals with one row of teeth ( except camels ) and also 
of certain birds and kinds of fish, yet in VI. 5-6 it takes up 
the same position as that of Manu viz. that himsa was allowed 
only in sacrifices &c. From V. 46-55 Manu takes up the 
position of total abstention from killing animals even in 
sacrifices ( they are the same as Visnu Dh. S. 51. 69-78 ). In 
one verse ( V. 48 which is the same as Vas, Dh. S. IV. 7 ) Manu 
says that no flesh can be had without killing living beings 
and killing such beings cannot lead to heaven; therefore 
one should give up flesh. Verses 53 and 56 are very important 
as they convey that the merit of him who performs a horse- 
sacrifice every year for a hundred years and of him who dpes 
not partake of flesh ( throughout life ) is equal and that the 
word mamsa (flesh) is derived by the wise (from 'mam' and 'sah') 
as meaning ' he whose flesh I eat to day will devour me in the 
next world or birth.' Yaj. 1. 181 is just like Manu V. 53. Manu 
winds up the whole discussion (in V. 56) by stating that natural 
appetites lead men on to eat flesh or to drink wine or to indulge 
in sexual gratification and there is no sin in indulging in 
these when they are allowed by the iastra in the case of certain 
persons and on certain occasions; but abstention In these 
matters ( even on occasions when they . are permitted by the 
s&stras) leads to great rewards. 18 " From these passages in 

1864. This position tbat injury done to animals or plants according 
to Vedlo precepts is do himsa is an anoient idea. The Mait. S. III. 9. 3 
has the words ( when a tree is to be cut off for making a, sacrificial jost 
tbe adhvaryu priest places a blade of darbha on the tree at the spot 
where it is to be cut and then addresses the axe) 'Oh, axe do not injure 
this tree ; the axe is indeed ( like ) a thunderbolt ; he screens the tree 
from the thunderbolt by placing the darbha in order to effect ahims'ff '

t80 History of Dharma&Mra [ Ch. XXII 

Manu, Visnu and Vas. it is clear that when the extant works 
attributed to these authors were composed, they themselves were 
staunoh upholders of ahiihsa, but that there were two classes of 
people in their days who were not opposed to flesh-eating, one 
class holding that killing animals only for purposes for which 
the Veda expressly sanctioned himsa was not improper and 
another class that indulged in flesh-eating without restrictions. 
That in spite of tbe individual predilections of the author of the 
Manusmrti, general usage was different even in Manu's day is 
indicated by the fact that in III. 227 Manu says that in sraddha 
the performer should get ready various kinds of food including 
flesh of tempting varieties. Yaj. I. 258-260 states how flesh of 
various animals when served in sraddha to the brahmanas invited 
tends to cause satisfaction to the Manes for long periods. Brhas- 
pati quoted by Sarvajria-Narayana explained Manu V. 27 as apari- 
samkhya i. e. Manu does not enjoin flesh-eating on the four 
occasions stated, but only permits it and forbids it on other 
occasions. ,8es Centuries were required before the views pro- 
pounded by Manu became predominant. Gradually large sec- 
tions of the population of India gave up flesh-eating and even 
those who did not regard it as forbidden to them rarely partook 
of it or did so in an apologetic way. The spread of Vaisnavism 
tended to wean people from flesh as required by the Bhagavata- 
purftna"" (VII. 15. 7-8) which is to the Vaisnavas what the 
Bible is to the Christians. In medieval and modern times all 
brahmanas avoid flesh ( except some brahmanas in northern and 
eastern India that hold that fish may be eaten ) ; so also do 
many vaisyas, particularly those who are Vaisnavas and even 
among sudras there are many who do not touch flesh and regard 
abstention from flesh as meritorious. From ancient times the 
ksatriyas have been meat-eaters. The Mababharata has in 
several places to say a great deal on flesh-eating. In the 
Vanaparva 50. 4 it is stated that the Pandava heroes killed with 
unpoisoned arrows deer and first offered venison to brahmanas 
and partook of it themselves. In Sabha 4. 1-2 king Yudhisthira 
on the opening of Mayasabha feasted ten thousand brahmanas 
with various delicacies inoluding the flesh of wild boars and

deer. Vanaparva 208. 11-12"" offers the consoling thought ( that 
is conveyed by the Rgveda itself ) that animals killed in sacri- 
fices to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras went to heaven 
and it narrates the story of king Rantideva in whose sacrifices 
two thousand animals and cows were killed every day. Anu- 
sasana 116. 8 contains the view that there is nothing so nourish- 
ing as meat for those who are wounded or weak or worried or 
who are given up to too much sexual gratification and those 
exhausted by long travel. Anusasana 116. 16-19 allows flesh 
of animals killed by hunting to ksatriyas. There are some 
passages where the Mahabharata contains the same sentiments 
as those of Manu e. g. Anusasana 115 highly praises abstention 
from meat and a few verses of this chapter (e. g. 115. 41-45, 48) 
are very similar to Manu's ( V. 27, 51 ). S&nkha quoted by 
Apararka p. 1167 allows the flesh of buffaloes, goats, rams, ruru 
deer, ordinary deer and spotted deer. HSrlta quoted in the Gr. 
E. p. 375 mentions the flesh of goats, rams, buffaloes, deer of 
various kinds ( ruru, prsata, nyanku, rksa ), rhinoceros, and 
large forest boars as permissible, while Devala quoted by the 
same forbids the flesh of cows, asses, camels, horses, elephants, 
lions, tigers, bears, iarabhas, snakes, boa constrictor, rats and 
mice, cats, mongoose, village hog, dog, jackal, animals of un- 
known species, cheettas, dark-faced apes, monkeys and human 
beings. Manu V. 51 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 51. 74 ) says that he who 
gives consent to the killing of an animal ( for food ), who outs 
off the limbs, who kills the animal, who sells or purchases meat, 
who cooks it, who serves meat and the eater of meat — these are 
all guilty of killing. Yama ( quoted in Ahn. Pr. p. 533 ) says 
that the eater is the greatest sinner out of these, as, if there were 
no eaters of meat, no one would kill animals for food. 

Gaut. 17. 29 and 34-35, Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 17. 32-34, Vas. Dh. 
S. 14. 48, Visnu Dh. S. 51. 29-31, Manu V. 11-14, Yaj. 1. 172-175 
contain long lists of birds the flesh of which was forbidden and 
of those the flesh of which was allowed. A few of these may 
be noted. All birds that subsist on raw flesh ( vultures &c. ), 
the cataka, parrot, hafnsa, all birds that dwell in a village ( such 
as pigeons), baka, birds that scratch dunghills for food are 
forbidden ; while wild cooks and peacocks were permitted. On 
Jaimini Y. 3. 26-28 Sahara quotes a Vedic text that one who has

constructed the fire altar (agnicit) should not eat the flesh of birds 
till tbe sacrifice be has embarked on is finished. 

About fish there is no unanimity. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 17. 36-37 
says ' among fish the ceta ( long-nosed crocodile ? ) is forbidden, 
so also are fish with snake-like heads, the makara, fish that 
subsist on dead flesh, fish that have strange forms ( such as 
those that have heads like men, or that look like elephants )•' 
Manu on the other hand regards fish-eating as the worst form 
of flesh-eating and forbids all fish ( V. 14-15 ), but then makes 
an exception (V. 16 ) in favour of fish called Pa^hlna and 
Rohita if used in rites for gods and Manes and fish called 
rajiva, lion-faoed fish and fish having scales. Vide Vas. Dh. S. 
14. 41-42, Gaut. 17. 36, Yaj. 1. 177-178 also. 

About milk several rules are stated in the smrtis. Gaut*

170 lay down that the milk of a cow that is sandhinl, 18M the 
calf of which is dead, that gives birth to twins and that has 
not passed ten days after delivery, from whose udders milk 
oozes of itself, is forbidden. The milk of sheep and she-buffaloes 
also is not to be used until the' lapse of ten days after delivery. 
The milk of ewes, of camels and of all animals with one hoof 
is altogether forbidden. The Mit. ( on Yaj. T. 170 ) notes that 
even the ourds and other products of such milk as is forbidden 
are alBO forbidden, but Visvarfipa thought that only the milk 
of a cow whose calf is dead, or who is sandhinl, or who has not 
passed ten days after delivery is forbidden and not curds and 
other products thereof. The milk of even a cow that feeds on 
impure food should not be used 1870 ( Visnu Dh. S. 51. 41 and 
Atri verse 301 ). In the VayupurSna even the milk of she 
buffaloes is forbidden. 18 " Baud. Dh. S. (L 5. 159-160) prescribes 
the penance called PrSjapatya for drinking forbidden milk of 
all animals ezoept the cow and a fast for three days for drink-

ing the milk of a cow when forbidden. Apastamba-ararti ( in 
verse) forbids the milk of a kapilQ cow to all except to 
brahmanas and the Bhavisyapurafca says that even a brahmana 
is to use only such portion of the milk of such a cow that 
remains after employing it in rites for gods." 78 The Brahma- 
purana says ' one should not partake of curds at night even if 
one is starting on a journey, but in madhuparka it may be 
used at night. Ill-luck dwells in fried grain by day and in 
curds and barley by night and in Kovidara and Kapittha ( trees 
or fruits ) at all times * ( quoted in Gr. R. p. 370 ). Manu IV, 75 
forbids the eating after sunset of all food in which sesame 
are mixed. 

Several herbs and vegetables have been forbidden from very 
ancient times. According to Ap. Dh. S. ( I. 5. 17. 25-27 ) all 
herbs from which liquors are distilled,' kalafija ( red garlic ), 
palandu (onions), pararlka ( dark garlic ) and whatever similar 
vegetables are not used by respectable people, should not be 
eaten ; and a brahmana text prescribes that ' kyaku ' (mush- 
rooms ) are forbidden. Gaut. 17. 32-33 forbids tender leaves (of 
trees ), kyaku, lasuna and the resins of trees and the red sap 
flowing from incisions made in the barks of trees, Vas. Dh. 8. 14. 
33 forbids the eating of laiuna, palandu, kyaku, grfijana (turnip), 
slesmataka, the resins of trees and red sap ( as in Gautama ). 
Manu V. 5-6 forbids lasuna, palandu, grfijana, mushrooms 
( kavaka ) and all herbs that spring from impure soil and 
manure, red resins and red sap ( as in Gautama ) and iefu 
( slesmataka ) fruit. Yaj. 1. 171 and 176 adds iigru and pres- 
cribes the penance of oandrayana for eating forbidden herbs 
and vegetables. The great difficulty is to find out the modern 
equivalents of some of the herbs and vegetables. According to 
a verse quoted in Gr. R. p. 356 from the Smrtimafijarl there are 
ten varieties of palandu of whioh grfijana im is one. Apararka 
p. 249 quotes passages from' the Brahmapurana forbidding 
various kinds of herbs and vegetables. Vide also Gr. R. pp.

vegetables tbat are forbidden. Tbe Mit. on Y&j. III. 290 quotes 
a sutra of Sumantu tbat lasuna and other vegetables are not 
forbidden to those who are ill, if they are prescribed by way of 
medicine.' 8 " About asafoetida ( hingu ) Haradatta on Oaut. 17. 
32 says ' it is doubtful whether it is a resin or is a sap flowing 
from Incisions, but even respeotable people partake of it and tbat 
camphor not being red nor a resin nor a sap may be eaten.' The 
Sm. 0. ( on sr&ddha p. 413 ) says that some smrtis forbid the use 
of hingu in sr&ddha, while tbe AdipurSna allows it and therefore 
there is an option. The Gr. R. p. 354 shows that tbe round alabu 
( gourd ) was forbidden. Vrddha-H&rlta VII. 113-119 mentions 
herbs, vegetables and fruits that are forbidden. Vide also the 
Smrtimuktaphala ( fthnika pp- 434-435 ) for quotations as to the 
names of several roots, fruits and vegetables that were fobid- 
den together with their South Indian names. 

Ap. Db. S. II. 8. 18. 2 forbids the use of dark grains ( like 
masa beans ) in sr&ddha. The Mah&bhasya says ' when it is 
declared that masa beans should not be eaten, they are not to be 
eaten even when other grains of corn are mixed up with tbem ' 
(vol. I. p. 127)."" The Gr. R. p. 359 quotes the Brahmapurana ,m 
forbidding the use of certain cereals generally such as rajamasa, 
sthulamudga ( called ' methl ' in Marathi ), masura &c. Sahkha- 
Likhita im quoted in Ahn. Pr. p. 394 allows the employment in 
offering to gods of all cereals, except kodrava, canaka ( gram ), 
masa, masura, kulattba and uddalaka. Vrddha-Harlta VII. 
110-111 also mentions tbe corns that are forbidden. 

Gaut. 17. 14-16, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 5. 17. 17-19, Vas. Dh. S. 14. 28-29 
and 37-33, Manu V. 10, 24-25, Y&j. 1. 167 prescribe tbat cooked 
food which has become sour by being kept for some time or by 
being mixed with something else should not be eaten nor should 
stale ( over which the day or night has passed ) food be eaten, 
nor food cooked twice ( with interval ) except curds and butter-

porridge, pulse cakes, those boiled in oil and rioe boiled in milk 
or when mixed with honey ; and that even stale food flavoured 
with ghee or curds or the remnant of food offered to the gods 
may be eaten. Manu V. 25, Vas. Dh. S. 14. 37-38, Ap. Dh. S. I. 
5. 17. 19 and Yaj. 1. 169 say that articles of wheat and yam 
flour and products of milk though stale and unmixed with ghee 
may be eaten by all dvijatis, provided they have not turned 
sour. 

The above long lists of forbidden vegetables, meat, milk 
furnish examples of food that is jatidusta or svabhavaduqfc 
The rules about not eating stale and sour food illustrate food 
that is kaladuqta. Any article of food which is mixed up with 
forbidden .things like palandu or is in contact with unclean 
substances or food in which hair or an insect is found or in which 
excreta or the limb or tail of a mouse is found, food touched 
by a woman in her monthly course or in which a bird ( like 
the crow ) has thrust its beak or food touched by a dog or smelt 
by a cow or food from a house in mourning or from a family in 
impurity due to birth should be avoided ( vide ilp. Dh. S. I. 5. 
16. 19-20 and 24-29, Manu IV. 207-209, 212, 217, Yaj. I. 
167-168 ). If a dog or an apapatra sees food which a man is 
eating or if a person when engaged in taking his meal sees a can- 
dala, a dog, a orow or a cock or a woman in her course, he should 
leave the food and get up. Manu (111.239*240) says that a candala, 
a village hog or a village cook or a dog, a menstruating woman 
and an impotent person should not be allowed to see brahmanas 
eating, whether in rites for gods or Manes, or at times of gifta. 
Katyayana says that if a brahmana hears the voice of a 
candala, a patita, or a woman in her oourse he should at once 
leave eating and if he eats even one morsel after hearing their 
voice he has to observe a fast for one day. 1878 The rules 
about not eating food from a house in mourning illustrate 
food that Is nimUtadusta ('.forbidden by reason of an 
occasion or chance reason ),' the other rules about food

forbidden because of contact with unclean things or with garlic 
&c. exemplify safiaargardusta ( forbidden because of contact ) 
and the rules about avoiding food seen by a dog &c. are 
examples of kriya-du^ta (forbidden on aooount of certain 
actions). The smrti writers were not devoid of practical 
common sense. Baud. Dh. S. IL 7. 7 says that if in a heap of 
cooked food, hair, bits of nails or skin or insects or dung of rats 
is seen, then a lump from that part where these are seen should 
be taken out and the rest should have water sprinkled over it 
and holy ashes should be scattered over it and water should be 
again sprinkled over it and brahmanas should then louldly 
deolare the food to be all right and it may be then used for 
serving. Vaik. ,879 IX. 15 contains a similar direction. Par5' 
sara VI. 71-74 says that cooked food (rice) amounting in 
quantity to one droya or one adhaka, 1880 if licked by a dog or by 
a orow or smelt by a cow or an ass, should not be thrown away, 
but should be purified and then used, and that the portion spoilt 
by touch &c. should be taken away from the whole mass, the 
rest should be sprinkled over with water in which a golden 
piece has been dipped and fire should be brought in contact with 
it ( by ignited darbha ) and brahmanas should recite Yedio texts 
over it and then it may be served. Vas. Dh. S. 14. 23 and 25-26, 
Y&j. 1. 189 and 191 contain similar rules. 18B1 

Food cooked only for oneself and not for offering to gods or 
guests should not be eaten ( Gaut. 17. 19, Manu IV. 213 ). This 
is called safhskara-dusta ( forbidden on account of the absence 
of purificatory rites ) by the Smrtyarthasara p. 68. The largest 
number of injunctions are concerned with parigrahadusta ( food 
which may be good in Itself but is forbidden beoause of its 
coming from the hands of or being owned by certain persons ), 
The following is a fairly comprehensive list of such persons 
compiled from Ap. Dh. S. 1. 6. 18. 16-33 and I. 6. 19. 1, Gaut. 15.18 
and 17. 17-18, Vas. Dh. S. 14. 2-11, Manu IV. 205-220, Y&j.

son of a punarbhu, a worker in hides, a potter, a spy, one who 
becomes an asoetio without following the rules laid down for 
that airama, a lunatio, one who has sat down at his debtor's 
house in dhanja. Manu IV. 222 presoribes a fast for three days 
if a brahmana partakes of the food of these unknowingly, but 
the kfcchra ( Pr&jSpatya ) for knowingly doing so. Baud. Dh. S, 
II. 3. 10 presoribes the japa of Rg. IX. 58 ( tarat sa mandl ) for 
eating the food of one from whom it should not have been 
taken. Manu XL 253 and Visnu Dh. S. 56. 6 do the same. 

The next question is whose food may be taken. Great fluc- 
tuations have occurred in the usages during the last two 
thousand years or more in this matter. Gaut. 17. 1 says ' a 
brahmana may eat at the houses of all dvijQtis ( the three higher 
varnas) who are well-known to be performing the peculiar 
duties of their var&a or airama* Gaut. 2. 41, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 
18-19, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 3. 25 allow a brahmacarin to beg for food 
at the houses of men of all varnas, except those who are 
apapatra and abhiiasta ( suspected of mahapatakas ). Ap. Dh. S- 
I. 6. 18. 9 first prescribes for a brahmana who has returned from 
bis teacher's house that he should not eat in the houses of the 
ksatriya and other varnas ( as a general rule ), then he gives the 
opinion of some that he may take food from members of all 
varnas except sudras, provided they abide by the rules for their 
varna. He also notices that even sudra's food may be eaten if 
he serves a dvijati in virtue of his duty to do so. Even Veda- 
VySsa III. 56 expressly declares that all dvijatis who know 
each other's families may partake of food at each other's 
houses. 188 * Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 2-12 raises the question as to 
whose food may be eaten and names several sages who differed 
in their views. Kanva said that one may eat the food of only 
him who wishes to give ( and so requests ), Eautsa thought that 
one may eat the food of him only who is holy ( punya ) ; 
VaraySyani said that one may accept from whoever is liberal 
enough to give ; Eka, Eunika, Kanva, Kutsa and Puskarasadi 
held that alms ( food ) offered by a pure man may be eaten ; 
V&rsyfiyani said what is offered by any body without asking 
may be accepted ; according to Harlta one should not acoept 
food whioh is offered after an express previous announcement 
'I shall give you such and such a kind of food. ' Apastamba's 
own view appears to have been ( I. 6. 19. 9-11 ) that one should 
acoept the food of him whose conduct is religious and who 

1884. xtfn i<nTtar$i9TOn fifarresj f*jR)Ri*i<ji: i ^"ror HI. 56. 



Ch. XXII ] Bhojana-whose food may be eaten 789 

desires to offer food, that one should not accept the food even of 
a righteous man if he Bhows even the slightest unwillingness to 
give and that whatever is offered unasked may be acoepted. 
These directions are rather vague. 

In modern times a person is more lax in taking food pre- 
pared with oil or ghee or milk. He may take suoh food from 
members of oertain castes other than his own. But ordinarily 
he would not take food cooked in water from any person belong- 
ing to another caste or even sub-division of the same oaste. In 
towns and cities there is a strong tendency to considerably 
relax these restrictions. We saw above that in the times of 
Gautama and Apastamba and others a brahmana was allowed 
to take food prepared in the houses of ksatriyas, vaisyas, and 
even sudras. Gradually this latitude came to be restricted and 
most of the sutras and early smrfcis restrict the liberty to take 
food from sudras by Baying that only from the following among 
sudras a brahmana can take cooked food, viz. one who cultivates 
the brahmana's field on the system of paying half of the crops to 
the latter, a family friend, one's cowherd, one's barber, one 
doing personal service i. e. a dasa ( vide Gaut. 17. 6, Manu IV. 
253, Visnu Dh. S. 57. 16, Yaj. I. 166, Angiras 120-121, Veda- 
Vyasa III. 55 and Parasara XL 21 ). Manu and Yaj. add that 
any sudra who declares to a brahmana that the former is going 
to be dependent on the latter and who declares what his actions 
have been and how he will serve the brahmana is also bhojyanna 
( one whose food may be eaten ). The Mit. quotes a sutra 
which includes the potter among these ( on Yaj. I. 166 ) 
and Devala also does so. 1885 It may be stated that Parasara 
(XL 22-24) gives peculiar meanings to the words dasa, napita, 
gopalaand ardhika. The general rule forbidding the food of 
sudras is stated by Vas. Dh. S. 14. 4, Manu IV. 211 and 223, 
Yaj. L 160. Angiras 121 says that he who takes cooked 
food from sudras other than the five excepted above has to 
undergo oandrayana penance. Atri ( 172-173 ) prescribes the 
same penance for'a dvija eating the food of a washerman, an 
aotor and a worker in bamboos and the penance of paraka for 
taking the food of or residing amongst aniyajas. Vas. Dh. S.

VI. 26-29, Angiras 69-70, Ap. ( verse ) 8. 9-11 severely condemn 
a brahmana partaking of food from sudras. Angiras 75, Ap. 
( verse ) VIII. 8-9 declare that a brahmana who is an agrdhotrin 
and yet does not desist from sudra food loses five viz. his self, 
his vedic lore and his three ( sacred fires ). Medhatithi on 
Mann V. 84 expressly states that the barber is touchable and 
bhojySnna ( whose food may be taken ). This shows that up to 
the 9th century A. D. the rules about taking food from even 
certain sudras had not become rigid in all provinces of India. 
Angiras 77-78. Ap. ( verse ) 8. 11-13 and Yama ( quoted in Gr. 
E. p. 334 ) declare that a brahmana may eat at a brShmana's at 
all times, at a ksatriya's only on parvans ( on full moon &c. ), at 
a vaisya's when the latter is initiated for a sacrifice, at a sudra's 
never and the food of the four varnas is respectively like nectar, 
milk, food and blood. ,8M Acoording to Manu IV. 223 a 
brahmana could take from a sudra uncooked food for a night, if 
he had no other means of subsistence. When exaotly brahmanas 
were forbidden to take food from ksatriyas or vaisy as it is difficult 
to say. In the Kalivarjya section all that is forbidden is taking 
food from the five sudras enumerated in Manu IV. 253. Gaut. 17. 1 
prescribes that fuel, water, fodder, roots, fruits, honey, protection, 
what is offered unasked, a bed, seat, shelter, conveyance, milk, 
curds, roasted grain, iafarl ( small fish ), priyangu ( millet ), a 
garland, meat of deer, vegetables must not be refused when offered 
by any one spontaneously. VaB. Dh. S. 14. 12, Manu IV. 50 are 
to the game effect. Angiras l887 quoted in Gr. B. p. 337 states 
that oow's milk, barley flour, oil, oil-cakes, cakes ( of flour ) may 
be taken from a sudra and eaten and whatever else is cooked in 
milk. Brhat-Parasara VI. says ' uncooked meat, ghee, honey 
and oils extracted from fruits, even if they are kept in a 
mlecchaa vessel, become pure the moment they are taken out of 
suoh vessel; similarly milk, curds, and ghee contained in 
vessels of abhlras are blameless and the vessels are pure as long 
as these articles are contained in them. I8,s Laghu-Satatapa 128

says that corn lying in the field or on the threshing floor, water 
drawn from wells and milk while still in the cow enclosures 
may he taken even from one whose food is forbidden. Even 
such later writers as Haradatfca stated that a brahmana may eat 
the food of the five sudras named by Manu IV. 253 in extreme 
distress only. 

Certain articles were not to be eaten at certain stages only. 
For example, a brahmacarin was not to partake of honey, meat, 
and ksara-lavana ( vide Ap. Dh. S. 1. 1. 4. 6, Manava gr. I. 1. 
12 ). But in danger of life he could eat even these ( vide 
Medhatithi on Manu V. 27 ). Similarly a forest hermit and 
an ascetic were forbidden many things ( which will be 
discussed later on ). A 5satriya was not to drink soma juice 
( vide p. 140 above ). 

There were rules about the persons who might be engaged 
to cook and serve food. As brahmanas could in very ancient 
times eat the food of all varnas including at least some sudras, 
no difficulty must have been felt. The Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 2. 3. 
1-6 ) prescribes that aryas ( i. e. the three varnas ) purified ( by a 
bath ) may prepare the food for vaisvadeva ; they should stop 
speaking, coughing or spitting with their faces turned towards 
the food that is being prepared and should touch water on touch- 
ing their hair, limbs or garment ; or sudras supervised by aryas 
may be the cooks. Ap. Dh. S. further requires that when sudras 
are cooks they should shave their hair and beard and pare their 
nails every day or on the 8th day or parva days and they must 
always bathe with thoir olothes on. Laghu-Asv. 1. 176 says that 
food should be cooked by one's wife, daughter-in-law, son, pupil, 
elderly relative, or one's acarya or by oneself. Apararka ( p. 
500 ) quotes a verse of Narayana that food must be served to a 
dvijati by a wife of the same caste ( if he bas wives of different 
castes ). 

Although numerous rules are laid down about the persons 
at whose house food may or may not be taken, the ideal placed 
before householders was that they should not as far as possible 
eat at the houses of others and should only do so if they are 
invited by a blameless person ( vide Gaut. 17. 8, Manu III. 104, 
Yaj. 1. 112 ). Manu III. 104 holds out the threat that those who 
constantly seek to subsist on the food given by others become 
after death the cattle of those who give them food. 

It is necessary to say a few words on drinking liquor 
( madyapana ). 



792 tiistory of Dharmasaatra [ Ch. XXII 

In the Ijlgveda a distinction is made between soma and sura 
( liquor ), the former being an intoxicating drink, but reserved 
for being offered ( as a sacred beverage ) to gods and to be drunk 
by the priests, while the latter seems to have been meant as a 
beverage for oommon men and not usually offered to gods. In 
Rg. VII. 86. 6 the sage 189 ' Vasisflia implores Varuna to 
recognize that a man does not commit sin by bis own urge or 
power, but that it is due to destiny or sura, anger, dice ( gambl- 
ing ) or heedlessness. In $g. VIII. %. 12 the sage exclaims that 
draughts of soma when quaffed by Indra create in his heart such 
tumult as those who are heavily intoxicated engage in when 
aura' is drunk. Kg. I. 116. 7 mentions among the deeds of 
Asvins this that they filled a hundred jars of sura from the hoof 
of their powerful horse which ( hoof ) was like karotara ( a 
strainer or leather-bag?). Bg. 1. 191. 10 refers to the leather-bag 
( of wine ) in the house of a vintner. In belauding bhojas 
( liberal men ) Rg. X. 107. 9 says that they won the inner 
draught of sura ( from their foes ). In Rg. X. 131. ,89 ° 4 and 5 
the Asvins are praised for having drunk surama ( sura mixed 
with soma) and helped Indra in his fight with the Asura 
Namuci. In the Atharvaveda IV. 34. 6 the reward for the per- 
former of sacrifices is said to be heaven in which there are lakes 
full of ghee and honey, and wherein liquor flows like water. 
In Atharvaveda 14. 1. 35-36 and 15. 9. 2-3 sura is referred to. 
The Vsj. S. 19. 7 distinguished between sura and soma ' thou art 
the powerful sura" and this is soma ; don't destroy me when thou 
enterest thy place \ In the Tai. ,8 " S. II. 5. 1 ff, the Sat. Br. 
L 6. 3 and V. 5. 4 there is a legend of Visvarupa, the son of 
Tvasfo which narrates how he had three heads, one of which 
was Boma-drinking, one wine-drinking and a third for eating

food, how Indra cut off the heads of Visvarupa, how Tvasfa 
heing furious at the slaughter of his Bon performed a soma 
sacrifice from which he excluded Indra, how Indra, though not 
invited, consumed all the soma that was in the tub, how the 
drinking of too much soma injured Indra and how the gods 
healed him by the isti called SautramanI ( for Sutraman, ' the 
good protector', Indra). This SautramanI sacrifice was per- 
formed for a priest who drank too much soma and therefore 
either began to vomit or had severe purging. Vide Katyayana 
sr. 19. 1. 4. It was also performed by him who had an enemy (Sat. 
Br. XII. 7. 3. 4 ). In this sacrifice a brahmana had to be hired 
for drinking the dregs of sura offered in it and if one was not 
found willing to do it the dregs were to be poured on an 
ant-hill.'" 8 How sura ( liquor ) was prepared is described in the 
Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3. 5 and in Katyayana sr. 19. 1. 20-27 ( vide S. 
B. E. vol. 44, p. 223 n. 2 which summarises the com. on Katya- 
yana ). In Jaimini III. 5. 14-15 there is a disoussion about the 
SautramanI sacrifice and Sahara quotes the passage of the Tai. 
Br. I. 8. 6 about hiring a brahmana for drinking the dregs of the 
sura offered in the sacrifice. The Sat. Br. contrasts soma and of 
sura by saying * soma is truth, prosperity, light and sura is 
untruth, misery, darkness ' ( V. 1. 5. 28 ). The Sat. Br. V. 5. 4. 
21 expresses dread 1B8S of mixing up the libations of soma and of 
sura together. The Kathaka Samhita XII. 12 contains the follow- 
ing interesting remark. " Therefore an elderly person or a 
youngster, the daughter-in-law and father-in-law drink liquor 
and remain babbling together ; foolishness ( or thoughtlessness ) 
is indeed sin ; therefore a brahmana does not drink sura with 
the thought ' otherwise ( if I drink it ) I may be affeoted by sin'; 
therefore this is for ksatriya ; one should say to a brahmana that 
sura, if drunk by a ksatriya, does not harm the latter." IM * This 
passage makes it dear that at the time of the Kanaka Samhita 
publio opinion had come to this stage that brahmanas had 
generally given up drinking sura. This passage read with the

Tai. Br. quoted above establishes that it had become difficult to 
find a brshmana willing to drink even the remnants of sura 
left after being offered in a saored Vedic rite like the Sautramanl. 
The above passage from the Kanaka is quoted by the Tantra- 
vartika on Jaimini 1.3. 7 (p. 210) and explained by it as 
referring to sldhu ( rum ) and liquor prepared from honey- 
Samkaracarya in his bhasya on the Vedantasutra III. 4. 31 
quotes 1895 this passage expressly from the Katbaka Sarhhita. In 
the Ait. Br. ( 37. 4 ) it is stated that when a king has undergone 
a solemn coronation ceremony the purohita places in his hand 
a vessel of sura. Asvapati, king of Kekaya, proudly declares 
in the Chandogya Up. V. 11. 5 to the learned brahmanas that 
came to him for the lore about Vaisvanara ' in my country 
there is no thief, no miser, no madyapa ( drinker of intoxicants ), 
none who has not kept the sacred fires, none who is not learned. 
no man of loose character; whence can there be a woman of 
loose character in my country ? ' In Chandogya V. 10. 9 one 
who drinks sura is enumerated among the five grave sinners. 

It is somewhat strange that in some of the grhya sutras it 
is stated that in the rites on Anvas^aka day when pindas are 
offered to the male ancestors, pindas are offered to the mother, 
paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother and also 
liquor is offered. For example, the Asv. gr. II. 5. 5 says that * to 
the wives ( of the ancestors ) are offered sura and the scum of 
boiled rice in addition ' ( to the pindas ). 1896 The Par. gr. ( III. 3 ) 
states ' also to the female ancestors he makes pinda offerings 
and pours for them liquor and water oblations into pits. ' The 
Kathaka gr. ( 65. 7-8 ) also prescribes that in the Anvastaka 
sura was to be sprinkled with a spoon about the pindas for 
women ancestors and the pindas were to be eaten by servants 
or by nisadas or may be thrown in fire or water or brahmanas 
may eat them. It is difficult to account for this. If a conjee. 
ture may be hazarded, it is possible that women drank ( perhaps 
secretly ) liquor even when their husbands had given up the 
practice owing to the force of public opinion or that in those 
days (before the grhya sutras) intercaste marriages being 
allowed, the women ancestors might have been ksatriya or

vaisya women and bo were not unfamiliar with drinking. Manu 
XI. 95 forbids drinking to brahmanas and Kulluka notes that 
there were commentators who held that the prohibition did not 
apply to brahmana women. Whatever the reasons for the above 
directions in the grhya sutras may be, they run counter to the 
prevailing sentiments, not only of the Kanaka Sam. and the 
Brahmana texts, but also to the unanimous prescriptions of the 
dharraasutras and smrtis. 

Gaut. II. 25, ,m Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 17. 21, Manu XI. 94 forbid 
all kinds of intoxicants to brahmanas at all stages of life. Ap. 
Dh. 8. I. 7. 21. 8, Vas. Dh. S. I. 20, Visnu Dh. S. 35. 1., Manu 
XI. 54, Yaj. III. 227 hold that drinking sura or madya is one 
of the grave sins ( mahapatakas ). In spite of this, the Baud. 
Dh. S. I. 2. 4 notes that among the five peculiar praotices of the 
brahmanas in the north was that of drinking rum and it 
condemns all the five practices. The verses of Manu ( XI, 
93-94 ) 1898 are frequently quoted in digests and commentaries 
' sura is the filthy refuse of food and sin indeed is called mala 
(filth); therefore, a brahmana, a rajanya, and a vaisya should not 
drink sura, which is of three kinds, viz. prepared from molasses ) 
from flour ( or ground grains ) and from flowers of the Madhuka 
tree ; brahmanas should not drink any one of these three. ' The 
interpretations put on these verses by Visvarupa on Yaj. 
( IIL 222 ), the Mit. on Yaj. III. 253, Apararka p. 1069 and 
others establish that the word ' sura ' primarily applies to paisti 
( liquor prepared from flour ) as Vedic usage in the Sautramaol 
saorifice and elsewhere shows, that paisti is forbidden to all 
brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas, that it is the drinking of 
paisti alone that constitutes a mahapataka, that all intoxicants 
are forbidden to brahmanas but liquors other than paisti such 
as those prepared from molasses or madhuka flowers are not 
forbidden to ksatriyas and vaisyas. In the Mahabharata 
( Udyogaparva 59. 5 ) both Vasudeva and Arjuna are described 
as intoxicated by drinking the liquor prepared from honey and

the Tanfcravfirtika tries 18 ' 9 to establish that there was nothing 
wrong in this as they were ksatriyas and as Manu XI. 93-94 
and Gaut. II. 25 are to be construed as stated above viz. all 
intoxicants are forbidden to brfihmanas and only paistl to 
ksatriyas and vaisyas. Intoxicants are not forbidden to sudras, 
though Vrddha-HSrfta ( IX. 277-278) declares that some desire 
that good sudras should abstain from sura also and that Manu 
says that even a sudra becomes patita by falsehood, by partak- 
ing of meat and intoxicants and by stealing another's wealth 
or wife. Another rule was that brahmac&rins, of whatever 
varna, had to abstain entirely from every kind of intoxicant 
( Ap. Dh. 8. I. 1. 2. 23, Manu II. 177, Yaj. I. 33 ). Visvarupa 
on Yftj. I. 33 refers to a passage from the Caraka-sSkhS which 
states that when Svetaketu suffered from a skin disease ( kilfisa ), 
the Asvins told him to take madhu ( honey or wine ) and meat 
as medicine, and when he asked how being a brahmacSrin he 
oould do so, they replied that a person must first save himself 
( from disease and death ) in all ways" 00 as a man can say ' I 
shall perform meritorious acts ' only if he lives. AparSrka quotes 
the Brahmapur&na and says that in the Kali age human sacrifice, 
Asvamedha sacrifice and intoxicating drinks were forbidden to 
the three varnas and to brahmanas in all yugas ( ages ). But 
this is opposed to history and tradition.' 901 The Mahabharata 
narrates ( Adiparva 76-77 ) the story of Sukra, his daughter 
Devay&nl and pupil Kaca and states that Sukra forbade for the 
first time brahmanas from drinking intoxicants and decla- 
red that, if any br&hmana drank sura thenceforward, he 
would be guilty of the grave sin of brahmana-murder. 190 * The

Ch. XXII ] Bhojanardrinking liquor 797 

Mausalaparva ( 1. 29-30 ) states that BalarSma prohibited the 
drinking of sura from the day the musala ( iron pestle ) for the 
destruction of the Yadavas was produced and directed that any 
breach of his order would be punished with impalement. The 
Santiparva ( 110. 22 ) declares that those men who always avoid 
honey and meat and intoxicants from their birth surmount all 
difficulties. Santiparva ( 34. 20 ) prescribes that, if a man 
drank liquor when in danger of life or through ignoranoe, he 
was to undergo upanayana again. Ace. to Visnu Dh. 8. 22. 
83-85 m3 intoxicants (madya) forbidden to brahmanas are of ten 
kinds viz. those prepared from madhuka flowers, from sugarcane 
juice, from fanka fruit (i. e. kapittha), from koli ( i. e. badara 
or jujube fruit ), from dates, from jack-fruit, from grape juioe, 
from honey, from maireya ( extracted from the blossoms of a 
plant ) and from cocoa-nut sap. Visnu ad ds that these ten kinds 
are not forbidden to ksatriyas and vaisyas. Fulastya quoted 
by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 253 and by Apararka p. 1075 states that 
sura ( distilled from rice flour) is different from the eleven 
kinds of madyas that he enumerates (practically the same 
as in Visnu). It may be stated that this sentiment against 
drinking is still very strong among brahmanas and drinking is 
still looked down upon by all castes, though, owing to contact 
with the West, some peop le ( even including a few brahmanas ) 
have come to regard it as a fashionable indulgence. 

Manu IX. 80 and Taj. I. 73 say that a wife who drinks 
liquor is to be abandoned (even if she be a sudra woman married 
to a brahmana ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 73 quotes a text ( of 
Parasara X. 26 and Vas. Dh. S. 21. 15 ) that half of the body of 
him whose wife drinks sura is guilty of grave sin 1 ' 04 ( on Yaj, 
III. 256 it is ascribed to Manu ). Vas. Dh. S. ( 21. 11 ) says that 
a brahmana wife who drinks sura is not allowed by the gods 
to reach the world of her husband ( after death ) and that she

wanders in this world as a leech in water or as an oyster." 05 
Yaj. III. 256 says the same and adds that such a wife becomes 
in her subsequent lives a bitch, a vulture or a pig in this 
world itself. 

Visvarupa ( on Yaj. I. 140 ) quotes a text that a vendor of 
liquors is to have a flagstaff at his shop to indicate that it is a 
liquor shop, that his shop was to be in the midst of the village 
and that he was not to sell sura to the antyajas except in times 
of distress ( i. e. in diseases &c. ). 1906 

Megasthenes ( p. 69 ) and Strabo ( XV. 1. 53 ) note that 
Indians did not drink wine except at sacrifices ( in the 4th 
century B. C. ). Gautama 23. 1, Maim XI. 90-91, Yaj. III. 253 
prescribe that if a person knowingly and frequently drinks 
sura i. e. pais^I, he can be purified only by death due to the 
pouring in his mouth of boiling sura or water or ghee or cow's 
urine or milk. Yaj. III. 254 prescribes another prayascitta 
( expiation ) also. Vas. Dh. S. 20. 19, Manu XL 146 and Yaj. 
III. 255 prescribe that if any one of the three varnas drinks 
sura through ignorance he becomes pure by undergoing the 
penance of Krcohra and by having his upanayana performed 
again. AparSrka ( p. 1070 ) quotes a smrti of Kumara that a 
child up to five years has to perform no penance for drinking 
any intoxicant, that after five but before upanayana the child's 
parents or other relative or friend has to undergo it viz. three 
krcchras. 1907 

Manu (VII. 47-52) enumerates in the case of kings ten 
vices springing from love of pleasure and eight vices produced 
by wrath and then states that among vices due to love of 
pleasure drinking, dice, women and hunting are the worst and 
that drinking is the most pernicious of all the vices of kings. 
Kautilya VIII. 3 agrees with this. Gaufc. XII. 38 and Yaj. II. 47 
declare that though sons and grandsons are bound to repay 
their ancestors' debt as a pious duty, they are not bound to pay

debts incurred for liquors, gambling &c. Among the articles 
that a brahmana is forbidden to sell even when he is forced to 
take to trade as a means of livelihood is liquor ( Manu X. 89 
and Yaj. III. 37 ). 

To return to the subject of bhojana. After finishing one's 
midday meal, a person was to chew tambula or mukhavasa ( des- 
cribed above p. 734) and it appears that in ancient times persons 
smoked also certain preparations made with fragrant herbs and 
medicaments ( and not tobacco which was then unknown ). For 
example, Bana describes in the Kadambarl ( para 15 ) that king 
Sudraka after his mid-day meal took in the smoke of fragrant drugs 
and then chewed tambula" 08 In the Caraka-samhita, sutra- 
sthana chap. 5, there is a description how a reed was to be smeared 
with pastes of sandalwood, nutmeg, cardamom and several 
other drugs and spices, how it was to be eight angulas long and 
as thick as one's thumb, how it was to be dried and the reed 
removed and then the dried portion was to be smoked. Vide 
Indian Antiquary vol. 40 pp. 37-40 for detailed information. 

The VisnupurSna III. 11. 94 remarks that after taking the 
mid-day meal one may do acts that would not cause exertion to 
the body. Daksa ( II. 68-69 ) says that after" 09 taking dinner 
one should sit at ease and allow the food to be digested and 
should read and listen to itihasa and puranas in the 6th and 7th 
parts of the day, and in the 8th part of the day the householder 
should look into his private worldly affairs and then perform 
the evening adoration ( sandhya ) outside the house. That the 
higher and middle classes of society attended in the afternoon 
the recitation of the Mahabharata ( the itihasa par excellence ) 
and the puranas in the 7th century follows from Bana's state- 
ment in the Kadambarl ( para 54 ) that even queen VilasavatI on 
hearing from the Mahabharata that the sonless do not reach 
heaven (which was recited in the temple of Mahakala at 
Ujjayinl) became' 110 extremely dejected and the fact that Bana

is said in the Harsacarita ( III ) to have listened after the midday 
meal to the recitation of the VayupurSna by the reader Sudrstf* 
Ysj. (1. 113-1H) directs that the rest of the day (till evening) 
should be spent in the company of sistas (learned and respecta- 
ble people ) and of dear relatives and then having performed 
the evening prayer and offered oblations into the three sacred 
fires ( if he has kept the three Vedio fires ) or into grhya fire, the 
householder should feed guests if they oome at night, then he 
should take his evening meal surrounded by (his children) 
and servants, should not eat too much in the evening and then 
go to sleep. Daksa ( II. 70-71 ) says that after evening he should 
perform homa, then take his meal, do other household work, 
then repeat some part of his Veda and sleep for two watches 
(six hours) and he should devote some time in the first and 
last watohes of the night to reciting the Veda already learnt. 

Numerous rules are laid down in the smrtis and digests 
about sleeping, viz. as to the position of the head, what kind of- 
bed to use, where to sleep and what texts to recite and so on 
Vide Gaut. II. 13 and IX 60, Manu IV. 57, 175-176, Yaj. 1. 136, 
VisnupurSna III. 11. 107-109 for some of these rules. Among 
the earliest works to give elaborate rules is the Visnu Dh. S. 
chap. 70, which is set out here. 'One should not sleep when 
one's feet are wet with water, nor should one have his head 
towards the north and west or lower ( than the other parts of 
the body ), nor should one sleep naked nor below a beam along 
its length nor in an uncovered place nor on a bed-stead of a 
pal&sa tree nor on one made of five kinds' 911 of wood nor on one 
made of trees split by an elephant nor on one made of wood 
burnt by lightning, nor on a broken bed-stead nor on one 
which is scorched, nor on a bed of trees watered with jars, nor 
in cemeteries nor in an unoccupied house, nor in a temple, nor 
in the midst of rash (or mischievous) persons, nor in the midst 
of women, nor above grain, nor in a stable of cows nor on the 
bed-stead of elderly persons nor over a fire or over an idol, nor 
before washing his hands or lips after meals, nor should one 
sleep by day nor in the twilight nor on ashes, nor on an unclean 
spot, nor on a wet spot nor on the top of a mountain/ Vide

Oh. XXII] Sleep 801 

Smrtyarthasara p. 70, Gr. B. pp. 397-399, Smrtimuktaphala 
(fthnika pp. 456-458), Ahnika-praka&a pp. 556-558 for further 
details. Some of them may he noted. One should bow to one's 
favourite deity and keep a bamboo staff near one's bed— says 
the Smrtyarthasara. The Smrtiratna says that one should not 
sleep on the same bed with a person suffering from an eye dis- 
ease or with one who is an epileptio or with one suffering from 
fever, leprosy, tuberculosis, asthma and hiccough. The Ratn&vali 
(quoted in Sm. M. fthnika p. 457) requires that one should 
place a jar full of water at the head of the bed-stead, reoite 
Vedio mantras for one's protection and mantras against poison 
and also the hymn to Night ( Rg. X. 127 ), remember the five 
ancient personages well-known as sound sleepers, 1 ' 18 viz. Agasti, 
Madhava, Mucakunda, Kapila and AstTka, salute Visnu and 
then go to sleep. Harlta (prose) quoted in Ahnikaprak&ssa p. 557 
oontains similar rules. Vrddha-Hftrlta (VIII. 309-310) says that 
an ascetic, a brahmaoftrl, a forest hermit and a widow should 
not sleep on a cot but on the ground covered over with a deer- 
skin or a blanket or with kusas. 

In connection with the subject of going to bed at night, a 
good deal is stated in the smrtis and digests about sexual inter- 
course between husband and wife. Some of these rules ( viz. 
about the proper days for intercourse ) have already been stated 
above(pp. 204-205). Gaut. V.l-2 and IX. 28-29, Ap.Dh. S. II. 1. 1. 
16-23 lay down that a householder is to approach his wife on the 
proper days or he may do so at any time exoept on forbidden days 
or when the wife desires it; he is not to have intercourse during 
day-time or when the wife is ill, nor when she is in her courses 
nor should he embrace her during that period. Ap. Dh. S. 
II. 1. 1. 19, Vas. 191 * Dh. S. XII. 24 and Yaj. L 81 refer to the boon 
conferred on women by Indra according to a legend narrated 
in the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. When Indra killed Visvariipa, son of 
Tvastr, he incurred the sin of brfthmana murder ; all beings 
loudly condemned him as * brahmahan ', and he went about the 
universe in search of sharers in his sin, of which one third was

taken by the earth (whioh secured the boon that when a pit Is 
dug it becomes filled up in a year), one-third by trees (that got 
the boon that even when pruned they would grow again and the 
exudation from trees is the part of brahmahatya that comes out 
of trees and the red resins exuded are therefore not to be eaten ) 
and one third by women, who got the boon that they would 
conceive only during their period ( of sixteen days ) after the 
recurring occurrence of menses and that they might indulge in 
intercourse till the time of delivery and in the case of whom 
the murder is manifested every month.' 914 Visnu Dh. S. ohap. 69 
puts all rules together, some of which are : A householder must 
avoid sexual intercourse after having been invited at a sraddha 
or having partaken of dinner at it or after having given a 
a sraddha dinner or after performing the initiatory ceremony 
of soma sacrifice; he must not have intercourse in a temple, in 
a cemetery, in an empty house or at the root of a tree, in the 
day time'*" or at twilight, or with a woman older than himself 
or with a pregnant woman or with one who has a limb too 
much or is defioient in a limb. Vide Visnupurana III. 11. 
110-123 for similar rules on the same topic. Most of the rules 
are eugenic or based on hygiene, though a few may be held 
to be only religious or superstitious. Gaut. IX. 26, Ap. Dh. S. 
II. 1. 1. 21-23 and II. 1. 2. 1, Manu IV. 4 and V. 144 say that 
after intercourse the husband and wife should take a bath or at 
least wash, sip water and sprinkle water over the body and 
should sleep on separate beds. Other writers stated different 
views." 16 

Rajasvala-dharmah. 

From the times of the Tai. S. rules have been laid down 
about the duties of a rajasvala (a woman in her monthly 
illness) and about how her husband and other people are to act

towards her. In the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. it is stated" 17 'One should 
not address a woman who has unolean clothes ( i. e. who is in 
her course) nor should one sit with her, one should not eat 
her food for she keeps emitting the oolour of brShmana murder; 
they say woman's food is unguent, therefore one should not 
accept unguent from her ; but anything else at will may be 
accepted*. The Tai. Br. III. 7. 1 states * Indeed half of this 
sacrifice is destroyed in the case of him whose wife beoomes un- 
touchable on the day on which the observances for a sacrifice 
commence (i. e. on the day previous to the performance); but 
the sacrificer should segregate her (in a different place or house) 
and offer the saorifice; by so doing he worships with a sacrifice 
that is entire (though the wife is absent).' 1918 The adhikarana 
in Jaimini ( III. 4. 18-19) is based on these texts; Sahara's 
bhasya quotes the passage of the Tai. S. and of the Tai. Br. and 
the conclusion established is that these rules, though occurring 
in the context of the new moon and full moon sacrifices, are 
not restricted to those sacrifices, but are to be observed by per- 
sons generally ( i. e. they are purugartha and not kratvartlia ). 
The Tai. S. II. 5. 1 contains thirteen directions about a rajasvala 
and declares what evil results follow from breaches of them. 
They are: there is to be no intercourse with her, nor in a forest 
( after she bathes ), nor when she is unwilling ( after bath ), she 
should not bathe during the three days, should not bathe with 
oil in those days, should not arrange her hair with a comb, 
should not apply collyrium to her eyes, should not brush her 
teeth, should not pare her nails, should not spin yarn, should 
not make ropes, should not drink water with a vessel made of 
palasa leaves or a vessel that is baked in fire (or is broken). 
The results of the breaches are respectively that the son ( born 
of her ) beoomes suspected or charged with grave sins, a thief, 
shy and not bold, destined to die in water, has a skin disease,

has a bald head and is feeble, is squint-eyed, has dark teeth, 
has bad nails, is impotent, is unrestrained ( or commits suicide 
by hanging), becomes a lunatic, or a dwarf. The Tai. S. further 
directs that she should observe these rules for three nights, 
should drink water with her hands joined together or with a 
plate that is not baked in fire. The Br. Up. VI. 4. 13 notes that a 
married woman in her courses should drink water from a vessel of 
bronze and should not wash her olothes, a sudra male or female 
should not touoh her; on the lapse of three nights she should 
bathe and she should be made to unhusk rice. Many of the 
sutras refer to the rules contained in the Tai. S. about the rajasvalcL 
( vide Ap. gr. 8. 12, ,m Hir. gr. I. 24. 7, Bhar. gr. I. 20, Baud, 
gr. 1. 7. 22-36, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 139 ). Vas. Dh. S. V. 7-9 con- 
tains the story of Indra and the boon given to women and also 
the rules about rajasvala ( adding that she should sleep on the 
ground, should not sleep by day, should not eat flesh, should 
not look at the planets, should not laugh ). When Vas. Dh. 8. 
V. 8. and Visnu Dh. 8. 51. 16 forbid the eating of the food of a 
rajasvala, what is meant is ( according to the Gr. R. and other 
digests ) that the food cooked for her or owned by her should not 
be eaten. Laghu-Harlta 38 prescribes that a rajasvala may eat 
food from her own hand used as a plate ; Vrddba-Harlfca ( XI. 
210-11 ) says the same and adds that if she be a widow, then 
she should not take food for three days and that one whose 
husband is living should have only one meal a day. Rajasvala 
women were also not to touoh one another. Visnu Dh S. (22. 
73-74) prescribes that if a rajasvala touches another rajasvala 
of lower varna she should observe a fast from that time till 
the fourth day when she takes the purificatory bath ; while if 
she touohes another rajasvala woman of the same varna or 
higher varna, she has to bathe and then take her food. More 
elaborate rules are laid down by Ahgiras 48 ( who prescribes 
paficagavya), Atri 279-283, Ap. (verse) VII. 20-22, Brhad-Yama 
IIL 64-68, Paraaara VII. 11-15. If a rajasvala is touched by 
a oandala or by any of the antyajas, or by a dog or crow, she 
has to be without food till she bathes on the 4th day ( Angiras 
47, Atri 277-279, Apastamba VII. 5-8). If a woman is suffer- 
ing from fever and becomes a rajasvala she is not to be bathed

on the 4th day to purify her ; her purification is to be effe oted 
by another healthy woman, who touches her and then herself 
bathes with her clothes on and this is done te n or twelve times 
and eaoh time there is sipping of water ; then the woman who 
is ill has her clothes removed and new ones put on and then 
gifts are made according to ability and she becomes pure 
( Usanas quoted in Mit. on Yaj. III. 20 ). Similar verses occur in 
Ahgiras 22-23. The same prooedure is followed where a male 
who is ill is touohed by a rajasvala or for some other cause he has 
to undergo the purification of a bath, viz. a healthy male touches 
him seven or ten times and bathes after eaoh touch, at the end 
of which the sickly person is to be declared to b e free from the 
impurity ( Angiras 21, ParSsara VII. 19-20 quoted in Mit. on 
Yaj. III. 20 ). If a rajasvala dies, then the corpse should be 
bathed with the five products of the cow (paficagavya), she 
should be covered with another garment and then should be 
oremated (a verse quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 20), while 
Angiras (42) said that the oorpse should be bathed after three 
days and then it should be oremated. The Mit- on Yaj. III. 20 
notes that, if a woman who usually has monthly periods, men- 
struates within seventeen days, then she has no impurity; if on 
the 18th, she becomes clean in one day, if on the 19th in two 
days and thereafter in three days. Vide Angiras 43, Apastamba 
(verse) VII. 2, Parasara VII. 16-17. 

So far we have desoribed the daily duties of common men, 
particularly of brahtnanas. Manu VII. 145-147, 151-154, 
216-226, Yaj. L 327-333 and Kaut. L 19 dilate upon the daily 
duties of the king. Kaut. divides day and night into eight 
parts eaoh and states that in the first part of the day the king 
should take measures for his protection and attend to income 
and expenditure, in the second he should look into the causes 
(or disputes) of the people of the oities and villages, in the 
third he should bathe, study or recite the Veda and take his 
meals, in the fourth he should receive revenue in gold and 
appoint (or examine) superintendents; in the fifth he should 
correspond with the council of ministers, and receive the secret 
news brought by his spies; in the sixth he may engage in what- 
ever amusements or sports he likes or in deliberation ( on state 
matters); in the seventh he should review elephants, horses, 
chariots and soldiers ; in the eighth he should oonsider with the 
help of his commander-in-chief plans of campaigns. When the 
day ends he should observe the evening prayer; in the first part 



806 History of Dharmaiastra [Ch. XXII 

of the night, he should see secret emissaries, in the second part 
of the night ho may bathe, revise his studies and take supper; in 
the third he should lie down after the burst of trumpets and 
sleep in the fourth and fifth ; in the 6th he should be awakened 
by the sound of trumpets, he should bring to his mind the 
dictates of sasfcra and the mode of oarrying them out; in the 
seventh he should deliberate and send out secret emissaries ; in 
the eighth he should receive, being aooompanied by his sacrifi- 
cial priests, Scarya and puroMta, benedictions and should see his 
physician, chief oook and astrologer and having circumambu- 
lated a cow with her oalf and a bull he should go to court. Or 
the king may divide the parts of day time and night time 
according to his capacity. Other smrtikaras differed here and 
there. KatySyana prescribed" 20 that the king should devote the 
three parts of the daytime ( divided into eight ) after the first 
part to judioial work and if he cannot personally do it, he 
should appoint a judge. Yaj. (1. 327-333) mostly follows (though 
concisely ) the routine sketohed by Kau^. The Manusmrti also 
hardly adds anything of importance to what we find in K&\i\. 
It is remarkable that in the Dasakumara-carita (ucchvasa VIII) 
the author closely following the words of Kautilya as to the 
engagements of the king during the eight parts of daytime 
and of night also puts in the mouth of the voluptuous jester 
Viharabhadra a parody of Kautilya's solemn dicta." 81 

As to the ahnika of vaisyas and sudras no special rules 
are laid down in the smrtis. They had to adjust the duties set 
out for brahmanas to their own case according to their 
circumstances. A vaisya belonged to the twice-born classes 
and he could do if he ohose almost every thing that a brahmana 
oould ( except officiating as a priest or teaching as a profession 
or receiving gifts). Vide pp. 154-164 for the disabilities and 
the few privileges of the sudra.

Upakarma or Upakaram means ' opening, starting or begin- 
ning* (upakrama as the Mit. on Yaj. 1, 142 says) and Utsarjana 
orUtsarga(in Asv. gr. III. 5. 13) means 'the cessation of 
Vedio studies for a certain period in the year. * Ap. gr. VIII. 1 
and Ap. Db, S. I. 3. 11. 2 employ the word ' samapana* for 
utsarjana. In former times these two rites were performed on 
different dates and in different months, but with the decline of 
vedio studies in medieval times they came to be performed one 
after another on the same day. In several sfttras the first of 
these two is spoken of as adhySyopakarapa (as in Asv. gr. Ill- 
5. 1.) or adhyayopakarma (in Par. gr. II. 10, Vas. Dh. S. 13. 1). 
In this case adhyaya means * study of the Veda' or it may mean 
Veda itself because it is studied ( pre-eminently ). Therefore the 
rite which signalises the opening of the session for Vedio Btudy 
in the year is itself oalled upakarma."" In Gaut. 16. 1 the 
rite of upakarma is called var^ika either because it took place 
in varsa (the rainy season ) or because it took place once a year 
(from ' varsa, a year). The Asv. gr. III. 5. 19 also states that 
this rite is oalled varsika. 

The time for upakarma is variously stated in the sutras. 
The Asv. gr. III. 5. 2-3 states 'when the herbs appear, 
when the moon is in conjunction with the constellation 
of Sravana, in the month of Sravana or on the 5th i(tithi) 
of Sravana when the moon is in the Ha sta naksatra. I he

Par. gr. II. 10 says' when the herbs appear, when the moon is 
in conjunction with Sravana on the full moon day in the month 
of Sravana or on the fifth of the month of Sravana when the 
moon is in Hasta. ' Gaut. 16. 1 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 1 require 
that it should be performed on the full moon day of Srtvana or 
Bhadrapada. The Khadira gr. (III. 2. 14-15) and Gobhila 
III. 3. 1 and 13 ordain that Upakarma should be performed on 
the full moon day of Bhadrapada or under the constellation of 
Hasta in that month or aooording to some on the full moon day 
of Sravana. The Baud. gr. III. 1. 2 prescribes that Upakarma 
may be done on the full moon day of Sravana or Asadha. The 
Hir. gr. (II. 18. 2, S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 241 ) says ' during the 
fortnight (at the end of whioh) the full moon of Sravana ocours, 
when the herbs have sprouted forth, the oeremony for the open- 
ing of the annual Veda study ( should be performed ) under the 
Hasta constellation or on the full moon day '. The Ap. Dh. S. 
1. 3. 9. 1 speaks only of the full moon day of Sravana as the time 
for the performance of the Upakarma rite. Manu. IV. 95 
prescribes the full moon of Sravana or Bhadrapada as the time 
for upakarma. Yaj. 1. 142 provides three times viz. on the full 
moon day of Sravana or on a day (in Sravana). when the-moon is 
in conjunction with the Sravana naksatra or on the 5th tithi of 
Sravana if the moon is in conjunction with Hasta. The 
Kurmapurana ( Uttarardha 14. 60-61 ) holds that Upakarma 
should be performed on the full moon day of either Sravana, 
Asadha or Bradrapada. In this rather bewildering variety 
of opinions commentators like the Mit. prescribed that one 
should follow one's grhyasutra." 8 * This means ( as stated by 
Medhatithi on Manu IV. 95 ) that the full moon of Bhadrapada 
being mentioned by Gobhila gr. and Ehadira gr. Chandogas 
( students of the Samaveda ) should perform upakarma on that 
day ; but as Ap. Dh. S, speaks only of the full moon of Sravana, 
the followers of the Krana Yajurveda should perform upakarma 
only that day. When there is no rain and so no herbs appear 
in Sravana or when that day is inauspicious owing to an 
eolipse or the like, Upakarma may be performed on the full 
moon day of Bhadrapada by those whose grhya sutra allows

the option of two months or on the fifth of the bright half of 
SrSvana. But if both days of the full moon in the two months 
are inauspicious, then Upakarma should be performed on the 
full moon of SrSvana. As the Baud. gr. refers to the full moon 
of Asadha, the followers of the Black Yajurveda may perform 
upakarma on Asadha full moon, if the full moon of SrSvana is 
not available. But the students of the Rgveda cannot do so, 
sinoe no sutra of the Rgveda speaks of Asadha as an optional 
month. Rgvedins have to prefer Sravana naksatra ( so that 
they may perform upakarma on the 14th or 15th of the bright 
half of Sravana ) ; the followers of the Yajurveda ( Sukla ) must 
perform it on the full moon day of Sravana when the moon is 
in Sravana naksatra, but if the moon is not so, then they have 
to prefer the full moon day. The students of the Taittirlya 
sakhfi also have to follow this last course. The followers of the 
Samaveda should prefer Hasta. Vide Sam. Fr. pp. 497-498, Sm. 
M. pp. 32-33, Nirn. pp. 114-120. Some interpreted Yaj. I. 142 
in such a way as to yield four times for upakarma, viz. the full 
moon of Sravana, the day in Sravana on which the moon is in 
conjunction with Sravana naksatra ( this may sometimes be the 
14th tithi of the bright half ), or on the 15th of the bright half 
of Sravana or on that day in Sravana when the moon is in 
Hasta. Why so muoh importance was attached to the month of 
Sravana and to the constellation of Sravana as the season for 
starting Veda study is obscure. It is possible that that month 
was originally chosen as owing to showers of rain it is 
pleasantly cool, there is more leisure and staying inside the 
house in that month for brahmanas than in other months of the 
year and then Nature is at its best. The month of SrSvana 
being fixed upon, the best day therein would be the full moon 
( Soma in another sense being the king of brShmanas ). If any 
other day in Sravana was to be chosen then the day on which 
the moon was in Hasta would be the best, which would 
ordinarily be the 5th of the bright half ( of Sravana ). As the 
PaurnamSsI of that month was called Sravanl owing to the 
moon's conjunction with the Sravana naksatra ( which conjunc- 
tion usually takes place on that day) the Sravana naksatra came 
to be associated with the starting of the annual session of Vedio 
studies. But that the Sravana naksatra by itself bad no direct 
connection with upakarma is clear from the fact that several 
sutras do not mention it at all. The Gobhila and Khadira gr, 
do not accept the full moon day of SrSvana ( but of Bhadrapada 
and the Hasta naksatra ) as the proper time for upakarma. 
h. d. 102 



810 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XXIII 

Oldenberg in his note on Sail. gr. IV. 5. 2 ' when the herbs 
appear, under the naksatra Hasta or Sravana ' ( S. B. E. vol. 29, 
p. 112 ) remarks ' the naksatra Sravana is evidently considered 
as particularly fit for this occasion because of its name contain- 
ing an allusion to iruti '. But this conjecture has no plausibi- 
lity. Hardly any ancient writer makes the suggestion that 
Sravana and Sruti are brought together on account of the root 
' sru '. The presiding deity of Hasta is Savitr. Owing to the 
supreme importance given to the Gayatrl verse ( of which 
Savitr is the deity ) and to the faot that Veda study begins with 
the recitation of the Gayatrl, the naksatra Hasta would be 
closely connected with the starting of Veda study. As a matter 
of fact the San. gr. IV. 5. 2 mentions Hasta first and then 
Sravana ; the Hir. gr. does not name the Sravana naksatra 
at all, but names Hasta in this connection ; while the Jtsv. 
gr., Par. gr. and several others mention both Sravana and 
Hasta. 

Upakarma is to be done in the morning. If for part of the 
day, the moon is in conjunction with Uttarasadha and then with 
Sravana that day is not to be chosen for upakarma, but the next 
day is to be chosen on which the moon is in conjunction with 
Sravana and Dhanistha. Later writers introduced further 
complications about the zodiacal sign ( raii ) in which the Sun 
would be at the time. Garga required that upakarma must be 
performed during the days when the Sun was in the sign of Leo 
by the followers of the Samaveda and by those who are to the 
north of the Narmada river. There is no upakarma in the 
intercalary month of Srftvana and Bhadrapada except for the 
followers of the Samaveda who must perform it in the inter- 
calary month. When upakarma is to be done for the first time 
after a boy's upanayana, the planets Jupiter and Venus must 
not be in the position of asta ( i. e. invisibility owing to their 
being too near the sun). 

Upakarma is to be done by brahmacSrins, by householders 
and also by vanaprasthas ( forest hermits ). The teaoher does 
it in the company of his pupils whether they be brahmacSrins or 
not and performs the homa in his own grhya fire, as the Par. 
gr. IL 10 says. Karka the com. of Par. gr. states that if the 
acarya has no pupils then he has no adhikara ( right or eligibi- 
lity ) to perform the upakarma in the grhya fire, while Harihara 
says that the praotioe of performing up&karma in the ordinary 



Ch. XXIII 1 Upakarma or upakarana 8il 

domestic fire in the company of a Veda student is based on no 
authority, but is a mere usage." 85 

The procedure of upakarma is set out as follows 1 '" in the 
Asv. gr. (III. 5. 4-12 ) : 'having sacrificed the two ajyabhaga$ utr 
( portions of clarified butter), he should offer oblations of ajya to 
the following deities, viz. Savitrl, Brahma, Sraddha, MedhS, 
Prajfia, Dharana (memory), Sadasaspati, Anuraati, Chandases 
(metres) and Rsis (sages). Then he sacrifices saktu (barley 
flour ) mixed with curds to the accompaniment of the following 
mantras ; the one verse ' I praise Agni, the purohita ' ( Rg. I. 
1. 1), IJM and 'the Kusumbhaka has said it* (Rg. 1. 191. 16), 'O 
bird, when crying announce welfare to us' (Rg. 11.43.3), 
* Sung by Jamadagni ' ( Rg. III. 62. 18 ), ' In thy abode the whole 
world rests ' ( Rg. IV. 58. 11 ), ' you ( Maruts ) that deserve sacri- 
fice, come to our sacrifice ' ( Rg. V. 87. 9 ), ' whosoever whether 
ours or a stranger (Rg. VI. 75. 19), 'look towards us, look in 
various directions' (Rg. VII. 101. 25 ), ' Come here, O Agni, the 
friend of the Maruts' ( Rg. VIII. 103. 14), 'O king, the oblation 
that is cooked for thee ' ( Rg. IX. 114. 4 ), — each time two verses ; 
the one verse ' one is our intention' (Rg. X. 191. 4); the one 
verse ' we choose that blessing and boon. ' When he is about to 
study the Veda he should, while the pupils ( i. e. those who are 
to be taught the Veda ) join him ( lit. take hold of him ), sacrifice

the ten mandates of the Rgvoda are repeated in making these oblations 
of barley mixed with curds. The verse ' taoobarayor-Kvrnlmahe ' is the 
last verse of the Bsskala recension of the Rgveda. Those who studied 
the Bffgkala slkhS were to reoite this last verse instead of Rg. I. 191. 4,

to those deities, 1 '" then offer an oblation to Agni Svistakrt and 
partake of the barley mixed with curds and then follows 
cleaning. mo Sitting down to the west of the fire on darbha 
grass, the ends of which are turned towards the east, he should 
dip darbha blades into a water pot, he ( the acarya ) should join 
his hands in the brahmanjali mi form and then recite ( together 
with his pupils, if any ) the following : the three vyahrtis pre- 
ceded by om, these and the Savitrl verse ( $g. III. 62. 10 ) he 
should repeat thrice and then the beginning of the Rgveda 
( either one hymn or an anuvaka ). 

In the other grhya sutras there is a good deal of divergence 
as to the mantras, the deities and the materials offered as obla- 
tions. Par. gr. II. 10 says that the two ajya portions are offered 
and then oblations of ajya are to be made to the earth and fire 
if the Rgveda is to be studied, to the Airy region and to Vayu 
if the Yajurveda, to the Heaven and the Sun if the Samaveda, 
to the quarters and the moon if the Atharvaveda and oblations 
are also offered to Brahma, to the Chandases ( metres ) in all 
cases, and to Prajapati, to the gods, to the Rsis, to Sraddha, to 
Medha, to Sadasaspati, to Anumati. Then Par, gr. ( II. 10 ) 
proceeds "with the verse ' Sadaspatim ' (Vaj. S. 32. 13=Rg. 
I. 18. 6 ) the teacher three times sacrifices fried grains. All 
( pupils ) should repeat the verse after him. After each oblation 
they should each time put on the fire three pieces of udumbara 
wood that are fresh branches with leaves, anointed with ghee, 
reciting the Savitrl. And the pupils should put on samidhs in 
the manner stated above ( Par. gr. II. 4 ). With the verse ' Sam 
no bhavantu ' ( Vaj. S. 9. 16 ) they should gulp down the fried 
grains without chewing them under the teeth. With the verse 
' dadhikravno ' ( Vaj. S. 23. 32 ) they should eat ourds. What- 
ever number of pupils he wishes to obtain so many sesame 

1929. ' Those deities '■— NsrSyaua explains that these words refer 
to the deities (SSvitri and others) enumerated above and the 20 
deities of the 20 verses ( at the beginning and end of the ten mandalat 
of the IJgveda ).

grains should the acarya sacrifice by means of a dice board ma 
with the Savitrl or with the anuvaka ( Vaj. S. 17. 80-86 ). After 
they ( the pupils ) have eaten (the remainder) the teacher should 
pronounce the word om and then repeat the Savitri three times 
and the beginnings of the adhyayas to the students who are 
seated facing the east. All repeat " may it be ours in 
comm on ; may it bless us in common ; may this Brahman be 
powerful with us together. Indra knows that through which 
and in which no hatred may spring up among us. " 

The Ap. gr. ( VIII. 1-2 ) is very brief and states that at the 
opening and concluding rites of Vedic study that Rsi who is 
indicated as the Itsi of the Kanda ( section of the Tai. S. ) to be 
studied is the deity to whom the rite belongs and in the second 
place Sadasaspati is the deity. Sudarsanacarya explains 19Si 
these two sutras at great length. Briefly what he means is : the 
commencement ( upakarma ) of the study of the whole Veda 
(Black Yajurveda) is to be done on the full moon day of Sravana, 
tarpana is to be done for nine B-sis and nine oblations of ajya 
are to be offered to these nine, the ninth being offered with the 
verse ' sadasaspatim * ( $g. I. 18. 6 = Ap. M. P. I. 9. 8 ). But 
when a Kanda is to be begun that is another upakarma and a 
homa is to be performed in respect of it also. 

Gradually many accretions were made to the simple upa- 
karma rite given in the Asv. gr. and other grhya sutras. In 
modern times upakarma is a most elaborate matter. That of 
Bgvedins may be briefly described here : After acamana, 
pranayama and reference to time and place, a sahkalpa is made

ration of the altar and fire ( as described before for homa in 
general ) ; then nine Shutis of clarified butter are made to the 
nine deities SSvitrl ( as in As v. gr. above), then offerings of 
barley flour mixed with curds are made to twenty deities with 
the first IMI and last verses of each of the ten mandalas of the 
Rgveda viz. to Agni, Aptrnasurya (plural), Agni, Sakunta, 
Agni, Mitravaruna ( dual ), Agni, Apah (waters), Agni, Maruts, 
Agni, Visve Devas, Agni, Indrasoma(dual), Indra, Agnamarutah, 
PavamSnasoma, Pavamanasoma, Agni, SamjnSna. Then the 
remains of barley and curds are offered to Agni Svistakrfc. 
Then the persons engaged in upakarma should partake of 
the remains of barley mixed with curds after repeating the verse 
' dadhikrivno ' ( Rg. IV. 39. 6 ). Then acamana and marjana are 
performed, then homa of a yajnopavlta in fire, then giving of 
yajnopavlta and daksin&s to brahmapas and wearing new 
yajftopavlta oneself ( whioh consists in its abhimantrana with 
the three verses ' apo hi stha ' Rg. X 9. 1-3 and several mantras 
beginning with ' hiranyavarn&h ', Tai. S. V. 6. 1. 1-2 and Tai. 
Br. I. i. 8 ), after symbolical nyasa ( deposit ) of omkara, Agni, 
Nagas, Soma, Pitrg, Prajapati, Viyu, SQrya and Visve Devas on 
the nine tardus ( strands ) of the yajnopavlta, then japa of ten 
G&yatrl verses for each of the yajnopavitas intended to be worn, 
then presenting the yajnopavlta to the Sun with the three verses 
' udyan-nadya ' ( B>g. I. 50. 11-13 ), clapping the hands thrice, 
then repeating the mantra ' yajnopavltam paramam &c. ' 
( vide /. n. 662 above ) and then putting on the yajnopavlta, 
then acamana, casting away the old yajnopavlta in water, 
pranSyama, then repeating three verses ' prthvl tvaya &c.\ then 
repeating the words ' Vidyudasi vidya me papmanam-rtat-

1935. The method of offering these oblations is first to mention 
the sage, the deity and metre of the verse and then to state the 
purpose of its employment in the rite, then to repeat the whole verse 
preceded by om and followed by svShS and then to put the oblation on to 

fire, e.g. wfl&fi* Wffrwr wif*^ wfirthnrr « g iwrtftwwqftftr^a f»f»-

and make others repeat ' om ', vyabrtis and Gayatrl thrice, then 
brahmayaj&a and then saying ' upakrfca vai vedah ' ( the study 
of the Vedas has been begun), then the Scary a finishes the rest of 
the rite such as prayasoitta, then all resolve to feed brahmanas 
and give daksina according to ability. The aoarya takes leave 
of the fire, bows to Visnu and sips water twioe. 

The grhyasutras prescribe a holiday ( anadhyaya ) after the 
performance of upakarma, though the duration varies. Par. gr. 
II. 10 prescribes that he should not Btudy the Veda for three 
days and nights and should not clip his nails or shave for that 
period and points out that some said that he should not clip 
nails or hair till the date of utsarjana ( i. e. for 5 months and a 
half). San. gr. IV. 5.17 ( =Manu IV. 119) prescribes an 
anadhyaya ( holiday ) for three nights on upakarma and utsarga. 
Gobhila gr. ( III. 3. 9 and 11 ) says that there is no study on the 
upakarma day performed on Hasta naksatra and that according 
to some teachers for three days before it and after it. The Bhar. 
gr. III. 8 enjoins that after upakarma there should be a holiday 
of three days or one day and for one month thereafter one should 
not study the Veda in the evening ( i. e. the first watch after 
sunset ). 

Utsarjana: — About the time of utsarjana also there was 
divergence of view. The Baud. gr. ( T. 5. 153 ) prescribes that it 
may be performed on the full moon day of Pausa or Magha. 
Asv.gr.(III.5.14) requires Veda study after upakarma for six 
months and so if the upakarma was performed ontbe new moon of 
Sravana the utsarjana according to it would be on the full moon 
of Magha ( vide III. 5. 20 also ). The Par. gr. II. 11 states that 
after having studied the Veda for five months and a half or for 
six months and a half they ( teacher and pupils ) should per- 
form utsarga (i. e. the rite of closing the course of Vedic study). 
These periods are only approximate, since Par. gr. II. 13 further 
on says that utsarjana should be performed in the month of 
Pausa when the moon is in the Rohinl naksatra ( i. e. about the 
eleventh of the bright half ) or in middle As^aka ( I. e. 8tb of 
the dark half of Pausa ). The Gobhila gr. III. 3. 14 says that 
utsarga is performed on the full moon of Taisa ( i. e. Pausa ), 
while the Khadira gr. III. 2. 24 says that having studied the 
Veda for four months and a half they close the session on the 
full moon day of Pausa. The San. gr. IV. 6. 1 holds that utsar-

utsarga takes place in Pausa on the Rohinl naksatra or on the 
8th of the dark half, while Manu ( IV. 95-96 ) says that after 
studying Veda for four months and a half from upakarma, utsarga 
should take place when the moon is in the Pusya naksatra 
thereafter or on the first day of the bright half of M&gha. The 
Manava gr. I. 4. 7 says that Veda study is stopped 4£ or 5 or 5£ 
months after upakarma. These several periods ( 41 months, or 
5£ months or 6| months ) and the various dates of utsarga in 
Pausa or Magha were due to the fact that upakarma may take 
place on the full moon day of ^ravana or -Bhadrapada ( or even 
Asadha) or on the 5th of the bright half of Sravana or on Hasta 
in Bhadrapada or Sravana. 

The Asv. gr. III. 5. 13 extends the procedure of upakarma 
to utsarga and adds ( III. 5. 20-22 ) that offerings of boiled 
rice are made to the same deities instead of clarified 
butter, then they take a bath and perform tarpana of those very 
deities and of acaryas, rsis and pitrs(as in brahmayajna )• 
NSrayana states that in utsarjana there is no eating (of 
barley"*' with curds) as there is in upakarma nor marjana. 
P*r. gr. II. 12 gives the prooedure of utsarjana as follows : "They 
( teacher and pupils ) should go to the brink of water ( a river 
&c. ) and offer oblations of water ( i. e. tarpana ) to the gods, to 
the metres, to the Vedas, rsis, the ancient teaohers, the Gandha- 
rvas, the other teaohers, the year with its divisions, the Pitrs, 
acaryas, their ( deceased ) relatives. After having rapidly recited 
the Savitrl four times, they should utter loudly ' we have stopped 
( Vedio study ). ' There is anadhyaya in utsarjana for the same 
period as on upakarma and they should then continue the repeti. 
tion ( of the Veda ) as before ". The Gobhila gr. III. 3. 15 says 
about utsarjana ' they go out of the village turning their faces 
to the east or north, they should approach water that is deeper 
than their waist, should bathe therein and should offer tarpana 
to the vedas, rsis and acaryas. ' A holiday was observed on 
the day of utsarjana for a day and half ( paksinl ) or three 
days after it ( Manu IV. 97, Ysj. 1. 144 ).

Ch. XXIII ] Utsarjana 817 

To give up Veda study for several months altogether was 
probably found undesirable. Therefore Manu IV. 98, Vas. Dh. 
S, 13. 6-7, Ausanasa ( p. 515 ) and others prescribe that after 
utsarjana the Vedas should be studied till the next upakarma 
during the bright fortnights of the remaining months and the 
Vedangas at one's will or in the dark fortnights. The Gobhila 
smrti III. 134 says that after Daksinayana ( sun's passage in 
the southern celestial hemisphere) for sit months one should not 
study the Upanisads andRahasyatexts. It appearsthat gradually 
the rite of utsarga in Pausa or Magha came to be discontinued. 
Astavakra 1W on Manavagrhya I. 5. 1 deplores that in his day 
hardly any one was found to celebrate utsarga on the day 
speoified by the sutrakara, that he was powerless to do anything 
or to upbraid any one but that he would only describe what the 
sastra prescribed. Similarly the Smrtyarthasara, after describing 
the procedure of utsarjana, remarks (p. 11 ) ' after studying 
the Veda for a year utsarjana may be performed on the day of 
upakarma or may not be so performed '. Gobhila-Srarti ( III. 
128-129, quoted in Sm. C. I p. 55 ) says ' when dvijas perform 
every year upakarma together with utsarjana according to the 
prescribed procedure, that results in the growth of the Vedas 
( Vedic study ). Whatever act is performed even in sport by 
brahraanas whose vedas have not grown stale, that act becomes 
successful.' Vide San. gr. IV. 5. 16 to the same effect. It is on 
account of this idea that in the sankalpa the expression ' yata- 
yamatanirasena ' ( by removing staleness ) occurs. In modern 
times utsarjana is performed on the same day as upakarma, but 
precedes the latter. These two together being generally per- 
formed in Sravana either on the full moon or on Sravana 
naksatra or on the 5th of the bright half of Sravana are 
designated by the word Sravanl. 

The modern utsarjana of Rgvedins may be briefly described 
here : after Scamana, putting on a pavitra ( a loop or ring ) of 
darbhas (on the finger called anaraika), pranayama, mentioning 
the time and place, a sankalpa ( as set out above ) is made ; then 
pafioagavya is taken in by all ; then the worship of Ganapati, then 
preparation of an altar for utsarjana homa is made, fire is invited 
with the verses 'jus^o damuna' (Rg. V. 4. 5) and 'ehyagna* (Rg. I.

of veda has been stopped ) ; then clarified butter is offered into 
fire by way of prayaaoitta with the verses ' ayascagne * ( Ap. M. 
P. 1. 5. 18 ), * ato deva, ' ( $g. I. 22. 16 ), ' idam visnur ' ( $g. I.

' purusa-sammito ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 11 ), ' yatJpakatrS ' ( Rg. X.

holy rivers; then he should honour Agni with the four verses 
' Agne tvam no ' ( Rg. V. 24. 1-4 ) and offer the upamras of

from the homa fire with the mantra ' manastoke ' ( Rg. I. 114. 8 ) 
and apply the ashes to his forehead, throat, navel, right and left 
arms and head ; then pray Agni to bestow sraddha ( faith ) (

CHAPTER XXIV 

MINOR GRHYA AND OTHER RITES 

The grhyasutras speak of certain other rites performed on 
certain fixed days in the year. Most of them have ceased to be 
performed in modern times, though vestiges of some of them 
appear even now. Gautama ( VIII. 19 ) enumerates the seven 
pakayajaasarhsthas among his forty sarhskaras. Out of these 
seven pakayajfias, astaka, parvana and sraddha will bo dealt 
with under sraddha later on. The seven haviryajnas and the 
seven somasarhsthas will be treated of in the note on Srauta. A 
few of the other rites are briefly described below. 

Parvava sthalipaka:— ' Among the seven pakayajnasarhsthas 
mentioned by Gaut. (VIII. 19) is the parvana sthalipaka. When 
a person is married and returns to his house after marriage he 
causes the newly married bride to sacrifice a mess of cooked 
food. The wife husks the rice grains of which that sthalipaka 
is prepared. She cooks the mess, sprinkles Tijija on it, takes it 
from the fire. Then he sacrifices to the deities of the Vedic 
Darsa-Purnamasa and then to Agni Svistakrt, With the 
remnants of the cooked food he feeds a learned brahmana and 
makeB the present of a bull to that brahmana. From that time 
the householder constantly sacrifices on the days of the full 
moon and of the new moon a similar mess of cooked food 
sacred to Agni. In the case of one who has not kindled the 
three Vedic fires, the sthalipaka is meant for Agni (it is Agneya). 
In the case of an householder who keeps the three Vedic fires 
the sthalipaka at Full moon is Agnlsoralya and Aindra or 
Mahendra or Aindragna on the New moon day ( Khadira gr. 
II. %. 1-3, Asv. Sr. I. 3. 8-12 ). Both the householder and his 
wife fast on the days of the full and new moon or they eat only 
once in the morning on those days ( Ap. Dh. S. II. 1. 1. 4-5, 
Asv. gj. 1. 10. 2 ). This is briefly the parvana sthalipaka. It is 
begun on the first full moon day after marriage and is conti- 
nued throughout the lives of the husband and wife. In the 
sthallp&kas performed throughout life on the full moon and 
new moon there is no daksina ( of a bull)."* 9 Vide for details

skara-kaustubha pp. 823 ff and Samskaraprakasa pp. 904-906 
among later digests. 

Caitrl: — According to Haradatta on Gaut. VIII. 19 the 
caitrl rite is the same as sulagava, known as Isanabali to the 
students of the Apastamba sutra (Ap. gr. 19, 13 ff.) and this rite 
called Caitrl was performed on the full moon day of the month 
of Caitra. In the San. gr. IV. 19 it is said that this rite takes 
place on the full moon day of Caitra and there is a brief des- 
cription of it which is rather obscure ( vide S. B. E. vol. 29, 
p. 132 ). The Vaik. IV. 8 describes it as follows : On the full 
moon day of Caitra the house is cleaned and decorated ; the 
husband and wife deck themselves in new garments ( lower and 
upper ) and with flowers etc. ; after two aghSras'" are made in 
fire and rice is oooked in a vessel for the deities, offerings are 
made of clarified butter, with the mantras ' grlsmo hemanta ' 
(Tai. S. V. 7. 2. 4 ) ' urnam me piiryatam, * ' sriye jatah ' ( Rg. 
IX. 94. 4 ), * Vaisnavam ' ( Tai. S. I. 2, 13. 3 ) and having offered 
oblations of boiled rice mixed with ghee to Madhu, 1941 Madhava, 
Sukra, Suci,Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, Urja.Sahas, Sahasya.Tapas, 
Tapasya, to the deities of Rtus, to herbs, to the lords of herbs, to 
Sri ( goddess of wealth ), to the lord of Sri, to Visnu ; having 
worshipped to the west of the fire the goddess Sri and the god 
Sripati whose face is turned eastwards, he announces the 
havis ( sacrificial food ) and having served to the recitation of 
the hymn to anna ( food ) the brahmanas with cooked caitrya 
food he should himself eat in the company of his sapindas. 

Sitayajfta ( sacrifice to ploughed land ) : — In the Gobhila gr. 
IV. 4. 27 there 1918 is a brief description of the sacrifice performed 
at the time of ploughing by one who kept the smarta or aupasana 
fire : ' on an auspicious constellation he should cook a mess of 
sacrificial food and should offer oblations to the following 
deities, viz. Indra, Maruts, Parjanya ( rains ), Asani ( thunder- 
bolt ), Bhaga. And he should also offer ( clarified butter ) to 
Sltft, Asa, Aradft, Anagha.' In Par. gr. II. 17 this rite is des- 

1940. For SghSras see note 489 above. 

1941. Madhu to Tapasya are the ancient twelve names of the 
months of the year mentioned in Tai. S. I. 4. 14. 1, VBj. S. VII. 30.

oribed in greater detail. But for want of space it is not set out 
here. The Par. gr. in II. 13 speaks of a different rite to be 
performed at the time of taking out the plough and using it 
for ploughing. 

firavani or tiravanakarma and Sarpabali :— Asv. gr. II. 1. 1-15, 
Par. gr. II. 14, Gobhila gr. III. 7. 1-23, San. gr.IV. 15, Bhar. gr. 
II. 1, Ap. gr. 18. 5-12 and others describe these two rites which 
are performed on the full moon day of Sravana, whether the 
moon be in conjunction with the constellation of Sravana or not. 
Asv. gr. desoribes it as follows : " M " Having filled a new jar 
with the flour of unbroken grains of barley he places it on a 
new sikya ( an arrangement of strings for holding pots etc. ) 
along with a spoon for making offerings ( bait ). Having got 
ready fried barley grains he smears"** half of them with 
clarified butter. At sunset he prepares a mess of cooked food 
and a cake on one potsherd and offers oblations (of cooked food) 
with the four verses * Agni I lead us to wealth by a good 
path &c.' ( Rg. 1. 189. 1-4 ) verse by verse and offers with one 
band the cake prepared on one potsherd with the mantra ' to the 
constant one, the Earth demon, svaha.' The cake should have 
been completely submerged in clarified butter or its top may 
be visible ; with the verse ' Agni, do not hand us over to evil ' 
(Rg.I.189.5) he sacrifices over the entire cake the clarified butter 
in which the cake had been submerged. Reciting the verse 'may 
the steeds bring bliss to us in our invocations * ( Rg. VII. 38. 7 ) 
he sacrifices into the fire the fried grains with his joined 
hands."*' He should give the other ( not smeared with clarified 
butter) fried grains to his people (sons &c.). Out of the jar he fills 
the spoon with barley flour, goes out of the house with his face 
towards the east, pours down water on a pure spot and offers 
sacrifice with the mantra ' to the divine "" hosts of snakes, 

1043. Vide appendix for tbe text. 

1944. ' smears '-NSrSyarja explains that this should be done in the 
day and what follows is to be done after sunset. 

1945. ' joined bands '-When the sacriflcer joins his hands the 
applying of butter ( upastarana ) and the putting of butter over the 
havis are done by another person. 

1946. The words W"T%*^»7: fmrr may mean ' the serpents and 
the divine hosts.' In the 6at. Br. (S. B. B. vol. 44, pp. 367-368) ' Sar- 
pavidyff and DevajanavidyS ' are separate subjeots of study. But as 
tbe rite is for propitiating the serpents, it is better to take the words to 
mean 'serpents that are a divine host.'

svaha ' and makes an obeisance to them with joined hands in 
the words ' the serpents that are terrestrial, 1947 that are aerial, 
that are celestial, that dwell in the several directions — to them 
I have brought this bait; to them I make ready this ball. 
Having gone round the bali with the right hand turned towards 
it, he sits down to the west of the bali ( and reoites the mantra ) 
' thou art a serpent ; thou art the lord of serpents that creep ; 
by food thou protectest men and by a cake the serpents, 
by sacrifice the gods, me who am in thee ( i. e. who seek thy 
favour and protection ) may not the serpents who also are in 
thee do any harm ; I give over the Dhruva ( spoon ) to thee.' 
Then with the words ' firm one, I give over this one, this one 
to thee * he gives his people ( son, unmarried daughter, wife ) 
one by one. With the words ' O firm one, I give myself over 
to thee ' he gives himself over at the end. Let no one pass 
between the sacrificer ( and the bali ) up till the rite of giving 
in charge ( paridsna ). mg ' To the divine hosts of serpents 
svaha '-with these words let him offer a bali in the evening 
and in the morning till Pratyavarohana. Some count the days 
till Pratyavarohana m9 ( from Sravana full moon ) and offer 
the same number of balis on that very day ( on which the 
sravana rite takes place )." The San. gr. IV. 15 has a similar 
ceremony called Sravanakarma ; however it practically con- 
tains nothing beyond rules about the bali to serpents and it is 
worthy of note that some of the 16 upacaras associated with 
honouring a guest and with devapvja are employed ( in it and 
in Ap. gr. &c. ) for honouring the serpents viz. offering a comb, 
unguents, flowers, thread ( vastra ), collyrium, mirror. The 
Par. gr. II. 14 is more elaborate as to sarpabcdi and the deities 
to whom the oblations of cooked food are offered are ' Visnu , 
Sravana ( naksatra ), the Full moon day of Sravana and 
the rainy season.' In Pfir. gr. also, a comb, ointment, collyrium, 
garlands are offered to the serpents. Ap. gr. 18. 5-12, Hir. gr. 
II. 16 ( S. B. E. vol. 30, pp. 237-239 ), Gobhila gr. III. 7. 1-23,

Oh. XXIV ] Minor Orhya and other Rites 823 

Bhar. gr. II. 1, Baud. gr. III. 10, Manava gr. II. 16 and others 
contain similar elaborate rules about sarpabali, the Hir. gr. 
and Ap. gr. requiring that the flowers used should be of the 
kiih&ulca tree. It appears that when the husband was absent 
the wife was to offer the bali during the four months. The 
Manava gr. II. 16. 6 adds that even the sudra wife of a brahmana 
should silently offer the bali after washing her hands. Vide 
San. gr. IV. 15. 20 also for the wife doing it silently. 

Serpent worship arose from the fears entertained about the 
deadly effects of snake- bites. The serpent cult is very ancient 
as the quotation from the Tai. S. cited above shows. Vide also 
AtharvavedaVIII.7.23 and XI. 9.16and24. In the Atharvaveda 
(VIII. 14. 14-16) the well known names of some mythical serpents 
viz. Taksaka, Dhrtarastra and Air&vata occur. The dangers 
from snakes must have intensified in the rainy season when 
serpents sought shelter in human habitations owing to vast 
areas being flooded and in search of their prey, viz. mice and 
frogs &c. Therefore the rite of offering a bali to serpents was 
performed on the full moon day of Sravana and a bali was 
offered every day to serpents for four months till the full moon 
of Margaslrsa on which day took place the Pratyavarohana 
( re-descent ) i. e. discarding the use of cots for sleeping on and 
using the ground for that purpose. Fergusson in his famous 
work 'Tree and Serpent worship* (1868) traces serpent worship 
in the nations of antiquity, such as in Egypt, Judea, Greece &c. 
In the Mahabharata nagas figure very frequently. Vide Adi. 
35 and 123. 71, Udyoga 103,9-16; Anusasana 150. 41 (where 
the names of seven nagas that support the earth such as Vasuki, 
Ananta &c. are specified ). In Anusasana 14. 55 Siva is said 
to have snakes on his body like yajflopavita. The purSnas are 
full of the stories of nagas. Serpent worship continues to this 
day particularly in South India, but now serpents are worship- 
ped on the 5th of the bright half of Sravana instead of on the 
full moon day of Sravana as in the times of the sutras. This 
day is now called NagapancamI and some account of it will be 
given later on under vratas. India possesses more varieties 
of serpents than any single country in the world and the toll 
of life taken by snake bites is very heavy as compared with 
any other country. 

In certain medieval digests like the Samskara-kaustubha 
( p. 122 ) a rite called Nagabali is described. It is performed on 
Sinlvall (a day on which the moon is seen, but there is am&v&sya 



824 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XXIV 

thereafter) or full moon day or on the 5th or on the 9th when 
the moon is in Aslesa (of which serpents are the presiding 
deity). Its object is two-fold viz. to expiate the sin of 
having killed a snake or snakes and to remove the obstacle to 
progeny ( supposed to arise from the wrath of serpents killed 
by a person ). In this a figure of a serpent is made of the flour 
of rice or wheat or sesame which is then placed in a surpa 
( winnowing basket ), then it is worshipped with the 16 upacaras 
( described above ) and a bali of payasa (rice-milk) is offered 
to it; then after washing the hands and feet and sipping water a 
homa is performed with ordinary fire ( but there is no svis^akrt 
offering); an oblation of clarified butter is offered with om 
and all the three vyahrtis into the mouth of the serpent figure 
and the rest of the ajya is sprinkled on its body, the serpent is 
praised with the mantras quoted above from Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3 
and certain Purana verses are repeated and the figure is thrown 
into the fire ; then impurity (asauca) is observed by the saorificer 
and his wife for three days or one day ; then eight brahmanas 
are invited, they are supposed to stand in the place of the burnt 
effigy and upacaras are offered to them, they are fed and gifts are 
given to them ; then a golden image of a serpent is put into 
the kalasa ( water-pot ) and prayer is offered to it, and the golden 
image or its value or a cow is gifted to a brahmana. 

The Par. gr. ( II. 15 ) describes a rite called Indrayajfia on 
the full moon day of Prosthapada ( i. e. BhSdrapada ). It is 
briefly as follows : Having cooked payasa ( rice cooked in 
milk ) for Indra 1950 and cakes and having placed ( four ) cakes 
round the fire, and having offered the two ajyabhagas he offers 
the milk rice to Indra ; he offers the ajya oblations to Indra, 
IndranI ( Indra's wife ), Aja Ekapad, Ahirbudhnya and to the 
Prosthapadas ; he offers milk-rice to Indra ; after he has eaten 
( a portion of the sacrificial food ) he offers a bali to the Maruts ; 
for Sruti says ( Sat. Br. IV. 5. 2. 16 ) ' the maruts are the eaters 
of ahuta ' ; mi the bali ( to Maruts ) is offered on leaves of the 



1950. «rs£ says ' $nrmmTf|nrnr **rtf& srnt 5?wreri.' WRTTg^

Asvattha tree, because there is a Vedic passage ( Sat. Br. IV. 3. 
3. 6 ) ' the Maruts stayed in the Asvattha tree. ' He offers the 
ball with the passage * Sukra-jyotir * ( Vaj. S. 17. 80-85 ) mantra 
by mantra and with the mantra called umukha which latter is 
to be revolved in the mind only (and not to be uttered loudly ). 
for the sruti says 'these are their names' IMB (Sat. Br. IX. 3. 
1. 26 ). He repeats the mantra ' Indram daivlr ' ( Vaj. S. 17. 86 ) ; 
then follows the feeding of a brahmana. 

The Kausika sutra ( 140 ) describes the prooedure of a 
festival in honour of Indra for kings. It is begun on the 
eighth day in the bright half of Bhadrapada or Asvina in 
which a banner is raised on Sravana naksatra. Yaj. I. 147 
declares a holiday for one day on the day on which the banner in 
honour of Indra is raised and when it is taken down. Apararka 
( p. 190 ) quotes Garga to the effect that the banner is raised by 
the king on the 12th of the bright half of Bhadrapada when the 
moon is in conjunction either with Uttarasadha, Sravana or

Indramaha ) was started by Uparioara Vasu. It is stated there- 
in that when that king was prevailed upon by Indra to desist 
from being a hermit in a forest and to rule over the country 
called Cedi, Indra gave him a bamboo staff as an affectionate 
gift and in honour of Indra the king planted it in the earth and 
since that time when the year ended a bamboo staff was raised 
by kings ( and also other humbler persons ) and next day it was 
decked with baskets full of fragrant substances and ornaments, 
and garlands were suspended from it. It is possible that the 
raising of a bamboo staff on the first day of Caitra every year 
in the Deooan and other places is reminiscent of this ancient 
festival in honour of Indra. The Brhatsamhita (chap. 43) describes 
the origin of the Indramaha festival and devotes over sixty 
verses to the elucidation of the method of celebrating it. Visnu 
gave to Indra a flag-staff to frighten asuras ; in verse 8 
it refers to Uparicara Vasu as the originator of the Indra 
festival, states on what auspioious conjunctions a carpenter 
and an astrologer should go to a forest and gives directions 
as to the tree to be selected ( Arjuna tree being the best ) ; 
then the tree is to be felled the next day and brought to the 
capital by the king on the eighth of the bright half of Bhradra- 
pada with a retinue of citizens, ministers and brahmanas ; the 
oity should be deoorated with fine patakas ( flags ) and toranas 
( festival arches ) ; on the 11th there was to be a vigil, the 
trunk of the tree should be pared and chiselled and it should 
be placed on a yantra ( a meohanioal oontrivance to raise it up ), 
homa is to be offered ; then it is to be raised up erect on the 
12th of the bright half of Bhadrapada when the moon is in 
Sravana naksatra or even without that being so ; five or seven 
wooden figures ( called sakrakumSrls ) are also to be placed 
near it ( to enhanoe the charm of the staff ) and two smaller 
staffs (one | and the other $ of the length of the principal 
staff) are also to be raised called Nanda and Upananda; 
another staff also is to be raised as Indra's mother; the 
staff was to be decked with several ornaments, baskets 
were to be hung round the staff, each one above the other 
and smaller in size, on the 4th day (from 12th tithi) 
verses in praise are to be recited and on the 5th day ( from 
the 12th i. e. on 1st of the dark half ) the staff is to be bidden 
farewell to. 

Aivayuji :— Gaut. VIII. 19 mentions AsvayujI among the 
■even P&kayajlas as included in his 40 sarhsksras. 



Oh. XXIV ] Minor Grhya and other Bites 827 

The Asv. gr. II. 2.^-3 describes"'* the rite as follows : * on 
the full moon day of Asvayuja ( i. e. Asvina ) the AsvayujI rite 
( is performed ). Having adorned the house, having bathed and 
put on clean ( white ) garments, they should take out a mess of 
oooked food for Pasupati and should offer it with the formula 
' to Pasupati, to Siva, to Sarhkara, to Prsataka, Bvaha.' He 
should saorifice with his joined hands a mixture of milk and 
clarified butter with the formula ' may what is deficient in me 
be made complete ( or full ) ; may what is complete not deterio- 
rate in me. To Prsataka, svaha.' 

The San. gr. ( IV. 16 ) requires that in this rite oblations of 
clarified butter should be offered to Asvins, to the two stars of 
Asvayuj naksatra, to the full moon of Asvina; to Sarad 
( autumn ) and to Pasupati and the mixture of milk and ajya is 
offered with the hymn Rg. VI. 28 ( a gavo agman ) and that on 
that night the oalves are allowed to join their mothers. 
Par. gr. II. 16 calls this rite Prsatakah, but it prescribes the 
cooking of payasa ( milk-rice ) for Indra and offerings of that 
mixture with curds, honey and ghee are made to Indra, IndranI, 
the Asvins, to the full moon of Asvina and Sarad ( autumn ). 
The Gobhila gr. III. 8. 1 also calls this rite Prsataka and it 
adds the tying to the arms &c. of amulets made of lac together 
with all sorts of herbs for the sake of prosperity. Vide also 
Khadira gr. III. 3. 1-5, Vaik. IV. 9 for this rite. 

In most of the grhyasutras another rite called Agrayana is 
described immediately after AsvayujI. Haradatta on Gaut. 
VIII. 19 explains that in the AsvayujI rite mentioned by Gaut. 
both the AsvayujI described above from Asv. gr. and Agrayana 
are included. Agrayana is also called ' Navayajna ' in Gobhila- 
smrti ( in verse III. 103 ) and Navasasyestf in Manu IV. 27.

NBrSyana explains that 'they' mean the aaorifioer and hia sons and other 
male descendants ( who touch him ). The word 'ni-rttpya' means that on 
the mess of cooked food, the two operations of nirvSpa (taking out a por- 
tion from the whole with the mantra <rgvtnfr WT ^i O ntmffi ) and proksana 
are to be performed and that the reat of the mess is to be eaten by the 
aaorifioer and his family, gnaw means ' milk mixed with clarified 
butter '. This is taken out with the truva ladle. There is an offering to 
Sviftakrt Agni of the mess and of pifStaka. qi t Qm U HI. 3. 3 says

Agrayana isti is prescribed in the Asv. srauta sutra II. 
9 and other srauta sutras for those who have consecrated 
the three vedic fires ( i e. Shit&gnis ). According to Narfi- 
yana an ahitSgni is to perform this agrayana saorifice of 
fresh corn acoording to the srauta sutra, but in case of 
difficulties he may do so in accordance with Asv. gr. II. 
2. i in the Treta fires and that one who has not conse- 
crated the three fires may offer the sacrifice in the iaia 
( i e. aupasana ) fire. This agrayana rite is required even 
by the srauta sutra as to crops of rice, barley and syamaka m * 
only and no one was to make use of fresh corn of these 
three kinds without offering this sacrifice, but there was no 
restriction as to the use of other kinds of corn or as to vege- 
tables &c. The word Agrayana is explained as mt ' that rite 
in which fresh fruits are first offered to gods ' or ' that rite in 
which fresh corn is first offered or eaten '. The deities of the 
srauta Agrayana are three, viz. IndrSgnl (or Agnlndrau), 
Visvedevas, DySvaprthivI (heaven and earth), but in the 
grhya Agrayana, Agni Svistakrt is added as the fourth ( San. 
gr. III. 8. 1, Ap. gr. 19. 7 ). Asv. gr. ( II. 2. 4-5 ) gives a very 
brief description 'united ,MT with the seasons, united with the 
manners, united with Indra and Agni, svahS; united. ..with 
Visvedevas, Bvaha; united. ..with Heaven and earth, svaha'- 
with these formulas a mess of cooked food is offered at the 
Agrayana by one who has set up the srauta fires; also by one 
who has not set up the srauta fires, (the same offerings are 
made ) in the domestio ( grhya ) fire. Ap. gr. 19. ( 6-7 ) also is

concise '(Now follows the description of) -5.gr ayana for one 
who has not set up the srauta fires. Having prepared a mess 
of cooked food with fresh corn, he offers oblations to the deities 
of the ( Srauta) Agrayana with Svis^akrt ( Agni ) as the fourth, 
he fills his mouth with grains of rice, swallows them, takes 
aoamana and having rolled up a lump of rice ( from the mess of 
cooked rioe) he throws it up on to the top of the dwelling with 
the next yajus ( Ap. M. P. II. 18. 1 ).' 

This rite is also desoribed in Sail. gr. III. 8, Par. gr. III. 1, 
Gobhila gr. IIL 8. 9-24, Kh&dira gr. III. 3. 6-15, Vaik. IV. 2, 
MSnava gr. II. 3. 9-14 &c. 

There is one peculiarity in Vaik, viz. that it connects the 
Pitrs also with this rite. According to Manava gr. the Agra- 
yana is performed on a parva day in Vasanta ( spring ) with 
fresh barley that is (then) harvested and with rice in sarad 
( autumn ). 

Vaik. VI. 19 prescribes the prayasoitta of padakrcchra or 
a fast for using first fruits without performing Agrayana rite. 

In modern times some vestige of this Navayajfla ( sacrifice 
of first fruits ) still remains. The full moon day of Asvina is 
still called in the Deccan 'navyacl paurnima' and a few ears 
of growing crops are picked up, are woven with flowers and 
tastefully arranged and the whole is suspended from the 
entrance door or its lintel. 

Agrahayatfi : — This is one of the seven pakayajfias men- 
tioned by Gautama ( VIII. 19 ) among his forty samskaras. 

The full moon day of Marga&rsa is called AgrahSyanI; 
the rite m8 performed on that day is also called by the same 
name on acoount of association with it. Pratyavarohana is a rite 
performed to signalise the giving up of the use of cots and high 
couches, recommended from the full moon of Sravana for fear 
of snakes ( as in San. gr. IV. 15. 22 ). Some describe two rites 
separately, one on the full moon day of Margaslrsa and another 
called Pratyavarohana on the first night of Hemanta (vide 
Ap. gr. 19. 3-5 and 8-12 ). There is some divergence as to the time 
and the exact procedure of this rite. Some (like. Asv. gr. II. 3. 1-2) 
hold that it may be performed on the 14th day of the bright

half or the full moon day of M&rgaslrsa. Others restrict it 
to the full moon day. Very elaborate descriptions are given in 
Par. gr. III. 2, Gobbila gr. III. 9. 1-23. As this rite has entirely 
gone out of vogue a brief description from the Siv. gr. alone is 
appended 1 '" here. " Having again ( after Asvayujl ) renovated 
the house with plaster ( of paint or cow-dung ) and by levelling 
( the floor ), they should offer after sunset oblations of payasa 
(milk-rice) with the mantras 'strike aside, 18 ' O white one, 
with thy foot, with the front and baok portions of the foot these 
seven women ( daughters ) of Varuna and all ( females ) that 
belong to the tribes of the king ( of serpents ). Inside the house 
of the white one the serpent did not kill any thing, adoration 
to the white one, the son of VidSrva, svfiha. ' Here no oblation 
is offered to ( Agni ) Svistakrt. While gazing fixedly at the fire 
he repeats in a low voice ' may there be no harm to us from 
the progeny 1 " 1 of Prajapati. ' He should think in his mind of 
Hemanta ( winter ) saying ' be auspicious and well-disposed 
towards us. ' To the west of the fire a well-spread layer of grass 
should be prepared ; he should sit down on it and having recited 
in a low voioe ' Be blissful, O Earth ' ( ftg. L 22. 15 ) he should 
lie down on that layer with his people ( sons &c. ) with the 
head towards the east and face turned towards the north. The 
others may lie down according as space permits or each should 
,lie down one after another, the elder one before the one next to 
him in years. Those ( of the sacrificer's sons &o. ) who know 
the mantras should murmur them (Pvg. I. 22. 15 and the mantras 
referred to in sutra 12 below ). Getting up from the layer they 
should three times recite the mantra ' from that place may the 
gods proteot us ' ( Rg. I. 22. 16 ) ; the same verse ( they should 
repeat ) a fourth time turning their faces to the south, to the 
west and the north. 1968 Having gathered together they should

S vasty ayana 1 " 3 mantras, cook food and feed the brahmanas and 
make the latter pronounce auspioious words. " In the Pali work 
called Anguttara-nikaya there is a section called Paccoro-

is described. Vide Anguttara vol. V. ( ed. by Hardy ) p. 233

AgrahayanI has been described also in Khadira gr. III. 3. 
1-26, Gobhila gr. III. 9, Manava gr. II. 7. 1-5, Bhar. gr. II. 2, 
Ap. gr. 19. 3-5, Kanaka gr. 60. 1 ff„ Kausika sutra 24. 24-36 
Hir. gr. II. 17. 1 ( where Matrdatta says that AgrahayanI is 
also styled Pratyavarohana ). Baud. gr. II. 10 speaks of a rite 
called Pratyavarohana to be performed at the beginning of each 
of the six rtus ( seasons ) and the intercalary month ( if any ). 
This is a different rite. 

£ulagava or Iianabali : — This was originally an offering of 
the flesh of an ox to Siva. There was some difference of opinion 
as to the time. Asv. gr. IV. 9. 2 states that it was to be perform* 
ed in Sarad ( autumn ) or in Vasanta (spring) under the constel- 
lation of Ardra. The Baud. gr. II. 7. 1-3 Bays that every year 
it was to be performed on the full moon day of Margaslrsa or 
on the Ardra naksatra 1 "* in that month or whenever cattle 
suffer from some pest or disease. The Kathaka gr. (52. 2-3) 
declares that the Sulagava may be performed from various 
desires in sarad or vasanta and that according to some acaryas 
there is no restriction as to season. The Bhar. gr. IL 8 and Hir. 
gr. IL 8. 2 say that it may be performed in the bright half of a 
month and on an auspioious naksatra.

spit ( or pointed rod ) i. e. Siva who is called Sfllin and that this 
sacrifice is offered to Rudra Sulin with the ox as a sacrificial 
animal. Haradatta explains that here the ox is marked with 
the rod ( of Siva ). 

This rite is most elaborately described in Asv: gr. IV. 9, 
Baud. gr. II. 7, Hir. gr. II. 8-9, Bhar. gr. II, 8-10, Par. gr. III. 8. 
It appears that even in the times of the grhya sutras there were 
many who did not like the rite of ox-flesh. The Baud. gr. (II. 7. 
26-27) says ,,M that if a person cannot seoure an ox he may 
sacrifice with a goat or ram or he may cook a mess of cooked 
food for Isana and with that he does everything that is to be done 
by means of an ox. The commentator Devapala on Kathaka im 
gr. 52. 1 says that only a goat is offered and the bull is let off as 
the people are opposed to the idea of the sacrifice of an ox. 

As this rite has totally gone out of practice only a brief 
description of it from the Mfinava grhya 1 " 8 ( which is the 
briefest of all on this rite ) is given here. ' Sfllagava is to be 
performed in Sarad for ( propitiating ) Budra. In the north-east 
of the village and not near it ( it is to be performed ) at night 
and there is to be a sacrificial post, not chiselled ( into an 
octagonal Bhape as in other sacrifices ), in the midst of oxen. 
Before the ( final offering ) to Agni Svistakrfc (i. e. after perform- 
ing the usual homa with boiled rice up to this point ) he should 
fill eight vessels made of leaves with blood and offer them in 
the principal quarters and the intermediate quarters with the 
eight anuvakas ( Tai. S. IV. 5. 1 ff. and Vaj. S. 16th adhyaya ) 
beginning with ' adoration to thee, O Budra, who are Manyu 
( wrath ). ' He should not bring the uncooked offerings into the 
village. He should bury into the ground the rest ( of the animal 
offered) and its skin also. Some ScSryas say that in the 
pakayajlas in which animals are sacrificed there is no saori- 
fioial post. '

Vastu-pratiQtha :— ( construction and occupation of a new 
house ). 

The Asv. gr. II. 7-9, ah. gr. III. 2-4, Par. gr. III. i, 
Ap. gr. 17. 1-13, Khadira gr. IV. 2. 6-22 and other grhya works 
deal with the matter of building a new house. Asv. gr. ( II. 7 ) 
says that one who intends to build a house should first 
examine the ground, which must be non-salinous, which should 
have herbs and trees, much kusa and virarja grass growing on 
it; that one should dig out thorny plants and plants having 
milky juice with their roots and remove them and also certain 
other plants like apamarga, tilvaka, etc. He should select a 
spot whero the waters coming together from all sides to the 
centre of it flow round the resting place having the latter on 
their right side and then are discharged off to the east without 
noise. Such a spot possesses all auspicious qualities. He should 
( Asv. gr. II. 8 ) also dig a pit knee-deep in the ground to be 
examined and then fill the pit again with the earth taken out. 
If the earth taken out fills the entire pit and some earth remains, 
then the plot is excellent for building a house on ; if all the 
earth dug out just fills the pit, it is of middle quality ; if the 
earth is not enough to fill the pit the plot is to be rejected. 
Another method is to fill the pit with water and leave it there 
through the night. If in the morning there is water in the pit 
the ground is excellent ; if it is moist only, the ground is of 
middle quality ; if it is found dry in the morning the plot is to 
be rejeoted. The three dvijatis should respectively select white, 
red and yellow ground as a site for their house. The plot should 
be square or reotangular and the owner should draw a thousand 
furrows on it. ' With a 6aml or udumbara branch be sprinkles 
the ground with water, going thrice round it with his right hand 
towards it and recites the Santatlya hymn. im He does this 
thrice pouring out water without interruption with the three 
verses ' apo hi stfia ' ( Rg. X. 9. 1-3 ). Under the divisions of 
the bamboo which rests on the chief posts he should have the 
single rooms constructed. Into the pits in which the posts are 
to stand he should have an avaka and the water plant called 
slpals put down. Having put the plant into the pit in which 
the middle post is to stand he should spread on it east-ward 
pointed and north-ward pointed kusa grass and should sprinkle

15) commence with the word •dam* and also have the same word 
several times.

on the kusas water into which rioe and barley have been thrown 
with the words ' to the steady one, the earth demon, svaha.' 
He should when the middle post is being erected repeat over it 
the two verses ' stand here &c.' and ' to thee the young child 
may come &o.' Over the bamboo staff when it is placed on the 
middle post he recites the hemistich ' rightly asoend the post 
&c* On four stones on which durva grass has been spread 
he should establish the water barrel with the words ' arise on 
the earth ' or with the verse ' the arangara sounds &c.' He then 
Bhould pour water into it with the verse ' hither may king 
Varuna come &c.' He then appeases it as follows : he puts 
gold into water in which rice and barley have been put and 
with that water he sprinkles it three times, going round it 
with bis right turned towards it with the Santatlya hymn. 
This he does three times pouring water without interruption 
with the three verses ' apo hi s^ha ' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). In the middle 
of the house he should cook a mess of food, saorifioe from it 
with the four verses ' VSstospate prati * ( Jig. VII. 54, 1-3 and 
VII. 55. 1 ) verse by verse, ,m should oook food which should 
be given to the brahmanas to eat, whom he should cause to say 
' lucky is the ground.' 

The Matsyapurana ( ohap. 252-257 ) deals at length with 
Vastusastra, the construction of a house of various dimensions, 
its posts, the timber to be employed, the rites to be performed 
when laying the foundation and at later stages, the rite for 
Vastusanti ( propitiatory rite for averting evil ). 

The Matsyapurana ,WI (256. 10-11) states that a vastu- 
yajSa has to be performed five times in relation to a house, viz. 
when laying down the foundation ( lit. using the measuring 
line), when fixing the first post, when raising the first door 
frame, when entering the house (grhapravesa) and when vastu- 
santi is to be performed (for averting evil or on seeing portents). 
It briefly describes Vastuyajfia as follows (chap. 256. 5-9): 
On an auspicious day and moment, the stone should be laid 
over jewels and all seeds; similarly the post is to be worshipped 
at the hands of four brahmanas ; the priest who should wear 



1970. The hymn %. VII. 54 has only three verses but four obla- 
tions are directed. Therefore the 4th oblation is to be offered with $g. 
VII. 55. 1 which also is addressed to VXstos pati.

white garments should be master of the Veda and should be 
accompanied by the artizans, should fix the post that is washed 
with water mixed with all herbs (or herbs called sarvausadhi) 
and covered with many whole rice and decked with clothes and 
ornaments to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras and the 
tunes of auspicious musio; he should perform a homa with 
honey and clarified butter and should repeat the mantra ' vasto- 
spate prati' ( Rg. VII, 54. 1); then the owner should feed brah- 
manas with a dish of rice-milk. The Matsyapurana notes that 
the foundation should be laid in the north-east corner and the 
first post fixed in the south-east. The Matsyapurana (chap. 268) 
decribes the procedure of V&stusanti and remarks ( verses 33-35 ) 
that it should be performed when beginning the oonstruotion 
of a temple or a house or a publio park or when entering a 
town or one's house for the first time for averting all evil and 
it should also be performed every year in one's house. In that 
rite he should make the brahmanas repeat the Raksoghna hymn 
and a hymn to Pavamana Soma ( one from Rg. IX. or IX. 1 ). 

In modern times the ceremony of entering a newly built 
house is an important one, is an extensive affair and marked by 
great Mat. A very auspicious day is required for this ceremony 
and numerous astrological considerations enter into the choosing 
of a proper day. The ceremony of an entranoe is preceded on 
the same day or on the previous day by a vastusanti (propitiatory 
rite) of which grahamakha (a rite for propitiating the planets) 
forms a part and the usual rites of worship of Ganesa and the 
like ( mentioned at pp. 213-218 ) have also to be performed. A 
few salient features are mentioned here. A mandala is drawn 
divided into 81 squares, 62 devataa are invoked to be present in 
the mandala, then a homa is offered to the nine planets with 28 
oblations of fuel sticks, sesame and ajya to each planet and 
oblations are offered to other deities, the performer and his wife 
have holy water sprinkled over their heads from auspicious 
jars, the house is surrounded thrice with thread beginning from 
the east to the accompaniment of Raksoghna (Rg. IV. 4. 1-15 
or X. 87. 1-25) and Pavamana (Rg. IX. 1. 1-10) mantras and 
round the house water is continuously poured in a stream from 
a jar with the same two hymns. A pit is dug in the south-east 
corner of the house which is cowdunged, worshipped with flowers 
and sandalwood paste and a baked brick box containing seven 
kinds of corn, moss, flowers &c. is lowered into it and the pit is 
filled up. Then the house is entered to the accompaniment

of music by the owner who is accompanied by his wife, sons and 
brahmanas and who holds in his folded hands an auspicious jar 
filled with water and having fresh sprouts, durva grass thereon 
and marked with sandalwood paste and flowers and covered 
with cloth. The svasti hymn (vide note 1963 above ) and the 
hymn beginning with ' kranikradat ' ($g. II. 42. 1-3) are recited 
and the auspioious jar is put down on a heap of corn. Then 
the brahmanas perform punyahavaoana ( vide note 503 above ), 
they are honoured and utter ' may the house be lucky \ dinner is 
given to the brahmanas who pronounce benedictions, and the 
owner then takes hiB meal with his friends. im

CHAPTER XXV 

DANA (Gifts) 

Manu ( I. 86 ) and others state that in the four yugas ( ages ) 
viz. Krta, TretS, Dvapara and Kali, the principal aspeots of 
religious life were respectively tapas, metaphysical knowledge, 
sacrifices, im and gifts. Manu ( III. 78 ) eulogiseB the stage of 
householder as the most worthy because all men in the other 
asramas are cherished and fed with ( Yedic ) knowledge ( as a 
teacher of Vedic students ) and with food by him. Yama speci- 
fies the characteristic features of the four asramas as follows : 
' quiescence is the dharma of ascetics, cessation from taking 
ordinary food that of forest hermits, dana (making gifts) that of 
householders and obedience ( or service ) that of brahmacarins.' 
Vide Daksa 1. 12-13 also for the peculiar outward characteristics 
of the four asramas. Therefore the subject of dana ( gifts or 
charity ) will now engage our attention. 

Gifts of various kinds and donors have been highly 
eulogised in the Rgveda. There are danastutis ( eulogies 
of gifts) in Rg. I. 125 (where the gifts made by king 
Svanaya son of Bhavayavya to Kakslv&t are praised 
and dana in general is eulogised in verses 5-7 ), 1. 126. 
1-5 ( where the same praise is continued ), V. 61 ( where 
Syavasva praises the donors Taranta, Purumllha and Ratha- 
vlti ), VI. 47. 22-25 ( praise of the donor Prastoka Sarfijaya ), 

VII. 18. 22-25 ( praise of the gifts made by Sudas Paijavana ), 

VIII. 5. 37-39 ( praise of KasuCaidya), VIII. 6. 46-48 (praise 
of Tirindira Parasavya ), VIII. 46. 21-24 ( praise of Kanlta ), 
VIII. 68. 14-19, X. 62. 8-11 (praise of Savarni). Among the 
objects gifted the most prominent are cows. In Rg. I. 126. 3 
Kakslvafc represents 1 ' 74 that he received sixty thousand cows

from Svanaya, along with ten chariots to each of which four 
bay horses were yoked and in which young girls were seated. 
In Bg. VIII. 5. 37 reference is made"" to the gifts of ten 
thousand cows and of 100 camels by Kasu Caidya. In Rg. 
V. 30. 12 a gift of 4000 cows to Babhru by the men of king 
Rnancaya is mentioned. Horses are also often described as 
objects of gift. e. g. Eg. V. 18. 5 ( gift of 50 horses ), VII. 16. 
10, VIII. 46. 22 ( gifts of 60000 horses, 2000 camels, 1000 bay 
mares and 10000 cows ); VIII. 68. 17. For gifts of camels vide 
Ttg. VIII. 5. 37, VIII. 46. 22. For gifts of young damsels vide 
$g. L 126. 3, VI. 27. 8, VII. 18. 22, VIII. 19. 36, VIII. 68. 17. 
The word ' vadhu ' used in all these passages cannot mean that 
the young girls were meant to be the wives of the donees, since 
in some of them the 'vadhus' gifted are as many as 10, 20 or even 
50. 1W * So they were maid servants or female slaves. Eg. X. 117 
contains an eulogy of the gift of food, the 6th verse of which is 
the basis of the later teaching of Manu III. 118, Visnu Dh. S. 
67. 43, Bhagavad-gltft 3. 13 and is as follows : 'the foolish man im 
( who does not share with others ) obtains food to no purpose ; I 
say the truth that it is really his destruction; he does not offer 
food to Aryaman ( i. e. to the gods) nor to his friend ( or guest ); 
one who takes food alone (without giving to others) partakes 
simply of sin. ' This injunction was most assiduously followed 
at all times in India. In the Chan. Up. IV. 1-2 it is stated that 
Janasruti Pautrayana, a man of faith and very charitable, had 
erected everywhere shelters in order to feed at all times 
all people that came from all quarters. Kg. X. 107 (of 
11 verses) is an apotheosis of daksina (gift or saorificial fee 
which generally consisted of a cow or cows ), which word is 
repeated several times in almost every verse. Verses 2, 7 and 8 
are very interesting 'Those who make gifts of daksina (cows or 
fee) stand high in heaven, those who make gifts of horses stand 
in the world of the Sun, donors of gold secure immortality 
(beoome gods), those who give garments inorease the duration 
of their life. Gifts endow ( the donor) with horses, cows, the

moon (silver? ), gold, food which is the life of us and the know- 
ing (donor) makes gifts of his armour. Donors do not die ( they 
reach immortality in heaven), they do not go down to a low 
goal, they are not harmed, nor do they suffer pain ; daksina 
renders unto these donors this whole world and also heaven '. 
Rg. VI. 47. 23 mentions that from Divodasa gifts of ten horses, 
ten boxes ( i. e. chariots or boxes of gold ), ten garments, in 
addition to dinners and ten lumps of gold were received. 1 ' 78 \ 

It appears that although in the Rg. gifts of horses are 
spoken of as next in importance to gifts of cows, popular 
sentiment changed very early. In the Paundarika sacrifice 
the fee was a thousand horses and in the Jyotistoma one 
cow and one horse ( Sahara on Jaimini III. 4. 28 ). The 
Tai. S. II. 3. 12. 1 says " 79 ' Varuna indeed seizes him ( i. e. he 
suffers from dropsy ) who accepts the gift of a horse and that 
one should offer to Varuna as many offerings prepared on 
four potsherds as the horses accepted.' Jaimini ( III. 4. 28-31 ) 
establishes two propositions in connection with this that the 
isti to Varuna is to be performed when the gift of a horse or 
horses is accepted in a Vedic saorifice and that the isti is to be 
performed by the donor ( and not by the acoeptor). The Kathaka 
Sam. XII. 6 also recommends that the horse should not be 
accepted as a gift, as it has two rows of teeth. In the Tai. Br. 
II. 2. 5 reference is made to the gift of gold, clothes, a cow, a 
horse, a human being, a bedstead and several other objects and 
their presiding deities are said to be Agni, Soma, Indra, Varuna, 
Prajapati &o. The Tai. S. II. 2. 6. 3 says * he who accepts 
an animal with two rows of teeth, such as a horse or a human 
being, ( thereby ) secures ( to himself ) a portion of alman (self) ; 
he should offer a mess cooked on twelve potsherds to Vaisva- 
nara.' Manu X. 89 forbids the sale of the horse and other 
animals with unoloven hoofs ; but the Pehoa inscription from 
Garibnath temple shows that brahmanas engaged in the sale 
of horses and that a tax agreed to be levied from vendors and 
purchasers was made into a permanent fund for temples 
and priests ( vide E. I. vol. I. p. 186 ). Gaut. 19. 16 men- 
tions the horse among objeots that are gifted by way of

penance for gins. The San. Br. ( 25. 14 ) says " ,0 that he who 
after promising to gift all, does not giro all, is reduced to 
falling into a deep pit or is killed. The Ait. Br. ( 30. 9 ) 
enjoins 1MI that one should not accept a gift rejected by the 
priests and if one accepts it it should be given over to 
one's enemy. 

The Sat. Br. ( II. 2. 10. 6 ) says ' there are two kinds of 
devas, the gods ( heavenly ) and the human gods viz. brahmanas 
who have studied the Veda and mastered it ; sacrifice is divided 
between these two, i. e. oblations go to the gods and the fee to 
the learned brahmanas who are the human gods. These two 
kinds of gods when gratified place him { the sacrificer ) in 
nectar ( or in the celestial world ).* mt The Tai. 8. VI. 1. 6. 3 
states that ' it is indeed tapas when " 8S a man makes a gift of 
what he owns.' We saw above ( note 11) how the Br. Up. V. 2. 3 
inculcates the three virtues of self-restraint, charity ( dam ) 
and compassion. In the Ait. Br. 39. 6 ,m it is stated that the 
king when anointed should make gifts of gold, fields and cattle. 
But it appears from the story of Visvakarman Bhauvana 
narrated in the Ait. Br. (39. 7 ) and also in the Sat. Br. ( XIII. 
7. 1. 13-15 ) that when he desired to make a gift of the earth 
to his priest Easyapa as sacrifioial fee the earth appeared and 
sang a verse ' no mortal must give me away as a gift; O 
Visvakarman Bhauvana, you desired to give me away ; I shall 
plunge into the midst of water, so that this your promise to 
Easyapa is fruitless.' It seems however that gifts of villages 
had oome to be made very early. The Chan. Up. IV. 2. 4-5 
narrates how Janasruti desirous of learning the samvarga lore

chariot to which mules were yoked, his own daughter ( as a

known as Raikvaparna villages in the country of Mahavrsa, 
where Raikva lived. 

The literature on dana is of enormous extent. Apart from 
casual references in the other parvans of the Mahabharata, the 
major portion of the Anusasana parva is devoted to the various 
aspects of dana. The Puranas, particularly Agni (chap. 208-215 
& 217 ), Matsya ( chap. 82-91 and 274-289 ) and Varaha 
( chap. 99-111 ), contain numerous verses on dana. There are 
digests specially devoted to the topic of dana, the most extensive 
and important being Hemadri's Danakhanda (of the Caturvarga- 
ointamani), DanakriyakaumudI of Govindananda, the Dana- 
mayukha of Nllakantha, the Danavakyavali of VidySpati, 
the Danasagara of Ballalasena and the Danaprakasa of Mitra- 
misra. Only a brief summary of the topics dealt with in all 
these is attempted below. 

Wbat constitutes gift ( dana ) according to the sSstra has 
been discussed from very anoient times. There is a distinction 
between yaga, homa and dana. The first is constituted by 
abandoning something that belongs to one, intending it for a 
deity and accompanying it with Vedic mantras ; homa is throw- 
ing into fire something belonging to oneself over which one 
abandons one's ownership and which (thing) is intended for a 
deity ; dana consists in the cessation of one's ownership over a 
thing and creating the ownership of another over that thing and 
this last oocurs when the other accepts the thing, which 
acceptance may be mental or vocal or physical; vide 
Sahara on Jaimini IV. 2. 28 (quoted above in note 1703), 
VII. 1. 5, IX. 4. 32 and the Mit. on Yaj. II. 27. 1985 The Mit. 
explains that physical acceptance may be effected in various 
ways such as by actually reoeiving the thing in one's hand, by 
simply touching it and quotes a smrti which illustrates this 
'one should give (and the donee may accept) a deer skin (by 
touching it ) on the hairy side, a cow by its tail, an elephant by

its trunk, a horse by its mane, a female slave by ( touching) her 
head '. The Mit. adds that as it is impossible to accept a field 
physically (except by enjoying its fruits) its acceptance is 
effected by some enjoyment, however small, of its produce. 
The Visnudharmotfcara quoted in DSnakriyakaumudI p. 7 gives 
more examples of the method of acceptance. Vide Brhat- 
ParSsara ( chap. VIII. p. 242 ) for copious illustrations of the 
way in which a gift is to be accepted according to the nature of 
the thing given. The word ' pratigraha ' has a technioal 
meaning in Dharmasastra. Medhatithi on Manu IV. 5 says "" 
'merely taking a thing (from another) does not constitute 
pratigraha (as understood in Dharmasastra). The latter word 
is applicable only to a particular kind of acceptance viz. when 
a person accepts what is given by the donor with the idea that 
he ( the donor ) will derive from that act some unseen spiritual 
result ( adrsta or punya ) and when in making the gift a vedio 
mantra is repeated. When one gives alms, no mantra ( such as 
'devasya tvfi') is repeated and hence that is not the dana spoken 
of by sastra, nor does any one apply the word pratigraha to the 
acceptance of an artiole given through affection to a friend or 
a servant. ' When such a word as vidy&dana ( gift of learning 
to a pupil ) is used, the word dana is employed there in a figura- 
tive sense only; otherwise the teacher will have to give a 
daksina to the pupil, whereas it is the pupil who may give a 
daksina to the teacher. When some gift is made to an image, 
the word dana in that case is also used in a seoondary sense, as 
the image cannot accept the gift. Therefore Devala defines 
dana (of the iastric kind)" 87 as 'that is described as dana 
when wealth is given according to sastrio rites so as to reach a 
receiver who is a fit recipient as defined in the sastra. What 
is given to a worthy person without an eye to any particular 
object ( to be achieved by such gift ) but solely with the idea of 
doing one's duty, that is called dharmadftna'. The Dftna- 
raayukha p. 3 explains that the definition of dana given by

Devala applies to the best kind of dana (called sattvika) and not 
to dana in general. If a gift is sent to a person, but it is lost 
while on its way or it is stolen and never reaches the donee, 
then there is no acceptance and so no complete dana and the 
donor cannot reap the reward of dana in such a case. 

There are six angas ( constituent elements ) of dana, as stated 
by Devala, I988 viz. the donor, the donee, sraddha ( charitable 
attitude ), the subject of gift which must have been acquired by 
the donor in a proper way, a proper time and a proper place. 
The first four are clearly indioated in Manu IV. 226-227. 
These six will have to be dealt with one after another. 

One important word that deserves consideration in the sub- 
ject of dana is itfapurta. That word has a high antiquity. It 
occurs in the Rgveda and the sense seems to be 'the cumulative 
spiritual result or merit due to a man's performance of sacri- 
fices and oharitable acts '. Rg. X. 14. 8 is addressed to one 
recently "" dead ' may you join the pitrs, may you be united 
with Yama, and with your iqtapurta in the highest heaven*. 
The word, though employed in the singular ( probably as a 
samahara-dvandva compound ), oonsists of two parts, ista ( what 
is sacrificed ) and purta ( what is filled ). In the Atharvaveda 
also the word occurs •' may the istapurta of our ancestors save us 
( from our enemy ) ; I seize yonder ( man or enemy ) with divine 
wrath* ( II. 12. 4 ). Vide also Atharvaveda III. 29. 1. Some- 
times the two components are employed separately or in the 
dual when compounded. The Tai. S. V. 7. 7. 1-3 has the inter- 
esting observation ,M0 ' when he comes by the Devayana paths, 
then make ye his istapurta manifest to him ; whatever sacrifice 
was offered, whatever was handed over, whatever was given 
and the daksina offered, may Agni present in all actions 
place all that in heaven among the gods for us.' The Tai. 
Br. II. 5. 5 says 199> ' may Is^a and purta last for endless

years; having sacrificed with an offering that is ever-lasting, 
a man ascended to the highest and ever-lasting world ' and 
Tai. Br. III. 9. 14 remarks " the brahmana should sing ' you 
made gifts, you performed sacrifices, you cooked food ( for 
serving to others ).' Indeed istapurta belongs to a brahmana ; he 
makes him ( the king ) prosper by istSpurfca." The Vaj. S. 
XV. 54 says ' O fire, may you be awake ( or kindled ), may 
you be watchful for us ; join with istapurta ( the sacrificer ) and 
him with his istapurta.' The Ka^hopanisad I. 1. 8 states that 
when a brahmana guest is allowed to stay in a house without 
being served with food he destroys the istapurta, the issue and 
the cattle of the householder. The Mundaka Up. I. 2. 10 
condemns those who regard istapurta as the highest and do not 
hold that there is anything higher than that and states that 
the; have to come down to this world or to a lower world again 
after enjoying the blessings of Heaven. 

Apararka (p. 290) quotes the Mahabharata for defining 
ista and purta mt ' whatever is offered in the single fire ( i. e. 
grhya fire ) and what is offered in the three srauta fires and the 
gifts made inside the vedi ( in srauta sacrifices ) are called ista; 
while dedication of deep wells, oblong large wells and tanks, 
temples, distribution of food, and maintaining public gardens — 
these are called purta.' Apararka quotes Narada also ' Honour- 
ing a guest and performance of vaisvadeva constitute ista 
while the dedication of tanks, wells, temples, places for public 
distribution of food and gardens is called purta and also gifts 
made at the time of eclipses, or on the sun's passage in a 
zodiacal sign or on the 12th day of a month.' Hemadri ( Dana 
p. 20 ) quotes Sankba that nursing of those who are ill consti- 
tutes purta. Manu ( IV. 226-227 ) ordains ' one should always 
assiduously perform ista and purta, which when done with 
sraddha and with wealth justly acquired become inexhaustible. 
One should ever resort to danadharma ( that mode of dharma 
which consists in gifts ) which is either ista or purta, according

to one's means, after meeting a worthy person (as recipient ) and 
with a pleased attitude of mind.' 

Any one including women and sudras could make gifts. 
So much emphasis was laid on the duty to make gifts that 
Apararka quotes a verse "•' ' two persons should be drowned in 
water after tying round their neok a large stone, viz. a rich 
man not making gifts and a poor man who is not a tapasvin 
( who undergoes austerities or who is restrained )■' It is stated 
in Atri 46, Likhita 6 and other smrfcis that im ' Ista and purta 
are dharma common to all twice-born classes ; the sudra has 
authority to perform purta dharma, but not the Vaidika dharma 
( sacrifices etc. ).' According to Devala the donor should be 
free from incurable or disgusting diseases, be religious, chari- 
tably inclined, free from vices, pure and following a blameless 
profession for livelihood. Several smrtis note that it is a 
rare sight to see a man giving away in charity wealth earned 
by him. Veda-vyasa"* 5 ( IV. 60 ) says ' amongst a hundred 
men, one may be found to be brave, among thousands a learned 
man, among hundreds of thousands an orator, but a donor may 
or may not be found.' 

A good deal has already been said above (pp. 113-114) about 
the persons fit to be donees {patra) and an unfit one. A few more 
words may be added here. Daksa III. 17-18 states 'a gift 
made to one's parents, guru, friend, to a well conducted man, 
to one who has laid the donor under obligation, to the poor, 
the helpless, those endowed with special excellence, leads 
to rewards, while gifts made to rogues, to bards, to wrestlers, 
to those who devote time to bad lores, to gamblers and 
deceitful persons, to catas, to oaranas and thieves brings no

fruit ( or merit ). ,,M Manu 4. 193-200 ( = Visnu Db. S. 93. 
7-13 ) contains a list of persons to whom gifts should not be 
made, such as a brabroana who is like a cat or hypocrite or who 
does not know the veda. Brhad-Yama III. 34-38 enumerates 
those brahmanas who are unfit to be invited at a sraddha or 
to be donees such as lepers, those who suffer from incurable 
diseases, those who officiate at sacrifices for sudras, a devalaka 
and seller of Veda (teaching it with a prior stipulation for money) 
and in IV. 55-56 says that gifts made to brahmanas that are 
addicted to bad aotions, that are covetous, devoid of Veda study 
and sandhya performance, who have swerved from the vows 
proper ( for brahmanas ), who are wicked and who are immersed 
in pleasures of sense become fruitless. Vanaparva ( 200. 5-9 ) 
enumerates 16 futile gifts such as to one who left off the order 
of saihnyasa or of wealth acquired by unjust means &c. Almost 
the same verses occur in Brhat-Parasara ( VIII. pp. 241-242 ), 
which are quoted in Par. M. I, part 1, p. 188. Vide also Vrddha- 
Gautama (III. chap. pp. 508-509) for numerous futile gifts. It 
is one's duty to give food at the end of Vaisvadeva to all (vide 
note 1779 above) and the Visnudharmottara directs that as to gifts 
of food and clothing the only consideration is whether the donor 
is hungry or in need of olothes and not caste nor qualities. I9M * 
When on seeing a needy person the donor feels pleasure and 
indicates it by a smiling faoe, when he shows honour and is 
free from a feeling of ill-will or irritation (towards the sup- 
pliant), that is said to be sraddha, according to Devala. 1997 Manu 
IV. 235 says that he who gives a gift with honour and he who 
accepts it with honour both go to heaven, but if the reverse is 
the oase they go to hell. 

Numerous rules are laid down about the things that can 
be the subject of gifts (i. e. about deya). Whatever is in this

world a most; desirable thing and what one prizes most in one's 
house may be given to a man endowed with good qualities by a 
donor who desires inexhaustible (merit) from it— AnusSsana 
parva 59. 7.'* M According to Devala, that is a proper subject 
for a gift, which has been acquired by the donor himself without 
causing pain or loss to another or without worry or trouble to 
himself, whether it be small or valuable (or much ). ,M * It is 
not the extent of the gift that causes greater or lesser merit. 
Merit (pw&ya) of gifts depends upon the mental attitude, the 
capacity of the giver and the way in which the donor acquired 
his wealth. If a man 8000 were to give even the whole earth 
acquired by unjust means, or if he makes a gift without sraddha 
( as defined ) or to an unworthy person he would secure no 
prosperity (religious merit) thereby. On the other hand by 
making a gift of even a handful of vegetables with a heart full 
of sraddha and to a very worthy person, he may secure all 
prosperity. If one possessing a thousand makes a gift of 100 or 
one having ten makes a gift of one and another gives only 
water according to his ability, they all reap an equal reward. 

Among deya things, some are the best, some middling, some 
inferior. Food, 8001 curds, honey, protection, cow, land, gold, 
horse and elephant — gifts of these nine are said to be the best ; 
learning, house for shelter, domestic paraphernalia ( like oots ), 
medicine— -these four are said to be middling; shoes, swings, 
carts, umbrellas, vessels, seats, lamps, wood, fruits and what- 
ever is old and worn out and all other unspecified objects 
are inferior. YSj. ( I. 210-211 ) appears to have this difference 
in view when he says that a man, making a gift of land (capable

of yielding a crop or fruits), lamp, wood, garment, water (water- 
reservoir ), sesame, ghee, house for travellers, money for 
sotfcling a person as a married man ( or bringing about his 
marriage by finding a girl for him), gold, draught ox, is honour- 
ed in the heavenly world, while one who makes a gift of a 
house, corn ( of various kinds ), protection from danger, shoes, 
umbrella, flowers, unguents, conveyance ( ohariot &o. ), tree, 
a desired thing, a cot secures endless happiness. Gifts of three 
things are said to be superior to the gift of anything else and 
are styled 2002 atidana, viz. of cows, land and SarasvatI (vidya) 
according to Vas. Dh. S. 29. 19 and Brhaspati 18. Vas. Dh. S. 
29. 19, Manu 4. 233, Atri, 340, Yaj. I. 212 say that the gift of 
vidya is the best of all gifts such as those of water, food, cows, 
land, garments, sesame, gold and clarified butter. On the other 
hand Anusasana-parva ( 62. 2 ) and the Visnudharmottara 
( quoted by Apararka p. 369 ) say that the gift of land surpasses 
all other gifts. The Visnu Dh. S. 92. 1 says that the gift of 
protection from danger (abhayadana) is the highest. The gifts 
of certain objects were called mahadanas. These and a few other 
danas will be dealt with in some detail later on. 

Danas are divided into nitya ms ( called ajasrika by Devala), 
naimittika and kamya. Whatever is given everyday (such as 
food after Vaisvadeva &c. ) is nitya, what is given at certain 
specified times (such as on eclipses) or on account of doing 
certain acts (suoh as penance for lapses) is called naimittika. 
what is given through the desire of securing progeny, victory, 
prosperity, heaven or a wife is called kamya (as it springs from 
a desire). Dedication of a garden or of a well &c. is called 
dhruvadana (permanent gift) by Devala; while the Kurma- 
pur&na adds to the well-known three a fourth division called 
vimala ( pure ) defined by it as ' what is given to those who know 
brahma for securing the grace of God with a mind full of 
devotion.' Vas. Dh. S. 29. 1-15, Visnu Dh. S. 92 and Manu 
IV. 229-232 ( which are repeated in Vrddha-Gautama, chap. XL 
p. 586) and many of the puranas are eloquent over what

rewards a man reaps by making gifts of water, food, sesame &o. 
The Bhagavad-glta (17.20-22) divides danas into sSttvika, 
rajasa and tamasa and defines them as follows: When a gift is 
made because one feels it one's duty to make it and at a proper 
time and place and to a worthy person who will not return it, 
it is called sSttvika; when it is made with an expectation of 
the donee doing a good turn in return or with a view to secu- 
ring some reward therefrom and is given grudgingly, it is 
rajasa ; when a gift is made at an improper time or place and to 
an unworthy person and without showing honour to the reci- 
pient and with disrespect (or contempt), it is declared to be 
tamasa. 

Many texts emphasize a rule similar to that in the Bible 
' But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what 
thy right hand doeth, that thine alms may be in seoret'-Matthew 
VI. 3-4. Yogi-Ysjfiavalkya says 80 °* that the reward of 
making gifts secretly, possessing knowledge without being 
puffed up and engaging in japa without others seeing it is infi- 
nite. Devala says 'sacrifice, gift and study lose their power and 
perish by being declared to others, by boasting about them or 
by repenting of having done them. Therefore one should not 
without good reason (such as protecting a gift&c.) proclaim 
one's meritorious act.' 

Certain things when offered voluntarily by a person with 
his own hand must be aooepted and not spurned even by one 
who does not ordinarily accept gifts. Manu IV. 247-250, Ysj. 
I. 214-215, Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 19. 13-14, Visnu Dh. S. 57. 11 declare 
that kusas, vegetables (raw), milk, fish, fragrant substances, 
flowers, curds, clay, flesh, a bedstead, a seat, fried barley, 
water, precious stones, fuel-sticks, fruits and roots, honey, food 
offered without being asked ( except of the impotent, of prosti- 
tutes and of patita ) must not be spurned, but must be acoepted. 

Certain objects could not be donated either because one had 
no ownership over them or because the sages forbade suoh gifts. 
Jaimini ( VI. 7. 1-7 ) establishes several propositions, viz. that 
one can make a gift only of what one owns, that one cannot make

a gift of one's relatives (parents, sons and others) in the Visva- 
jit, that a sovereign cannot make a gift of the whole of hie 
kingdom, that horses cannot he gifted in that sacrifice as sruti 
forbids such a gift in that sacrifice, that a sudra who serves the 
sacrifioer merely as a duty cannot be given away and that what- 
ever is of the full ownership of a person at tbe time of giving 
the daksina can alone be gifted in the Visvajit sacrifice. 
Narada 200 ' (dattapradanika 4-5) forbids eight kinds of gifts 
viz. of what is handed over to a creditor by a debtor for delivery 
to a third person, what is borrowed for use ( such, as an ornament 
on a festive occasion ), a pledge, property jointly owned with 
others, a deposit, son and wife, one's entire property when one 
has children, what has been already promised to another man. 
Daksa III. 19-20 enumerates nine things as not proper subjects 
of gifts ( adding to NSrada's list ' a friend's wealth and gift 
through fear' and omitting 'what is already promised to another'). 
Yftj. II. 175 is of similar import. Apararka p. 779 quotes verses 
of Brhaspati and Katyayana to the same effect. Vide above 
( pp. 507-508 ) as to a man's power over his children. 

The texts took care to set limits to a man's generosity. After 
emphasizing in very eloquent language the obligation to share 
one's possessions, however meagre, with others, Veda-Vyasa 2006 
(IV. 30-31 ) inculcates the doctrine that charity begins at home. 
Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 10-12, Baud. Dh. S. II. 3. 19 ordain that one 
should not stint one's dependents (whom one is bound to main- 
tain), one's servants and slaves for distributing food to guests 
and others. Yaj. II. 175 prescribes that one should make gifts 
in such a way as not to cause detriment to one's family. 
Brhaspati* 007 explains this by saying that one may give away

wealth that is over and above what is required for maintaining 
one's family and for clothing and that the charity of one who 
disregards this rule is something that is sweet like honey at 
first but like poison in its effect. In this Brhaspati only echoes 
what Manu says (XI. 9-10) 'the charity of him who has wealth 
enough to make gifts to strangers, when his own people live a 
life of misery, is only a false imitation of dharma ( and not the 
true dharma), it is at first like honey but will taste like poison 
( later). Whatever a man does for his welfare in the next world 
by stinting those whom he is bound to maintain results in un- 
happiness to him while living and also after death*. The 
Anusasana parva ( 37. 2-3 ) declares that if one makes a gift 
stinting one's servants, he makes himself a sinner, even though 
one may say that one would give whatever any one begs for 
( compare Luke VI. 30 ' give to every man that asketh of thee ' ). 
Hemadri quotes 2008 Sivadharma to the effect that a man Bhould 
set apart three parts out of five from his acquisitions for him- 
self and his family and two parts for dharma, as life is 
evanescent. 

Certain things were forbidden to be accepted as gifts. The 
gift of animals with two rows of teeth was forbidden by sruti 
( vide Sahara on Jaitnini VI. 7. 4 quoted above ). Vas. Dh. S. 
13. 55 declares that a brahmana should not acoept the gift of 
weapons, poisonous substances and spirituous liquor. Manu 
IV. 188 states that a brahmana who is not learned should not 
accept the gift of gold, land, horses, cow, food, garment, Besame, 
clarified butter ; but if he accepts he is reduced to ashes ( i. e* 
perishes ) like wood. Hemadri ( Dana p. 57 ) quotes the Brahma- 
purana that a brahmana should not accept the gifts of ewes, 
horses, precious stones, an elephant, sesame and iron, and that 
one who accepts a gift of antelope skin or sesame would not be 
born again as a male and that if a person accepts the bedstead, 
ornaments and the clothes of one who is dead he would go 
to hell. 

As to the proper times for gifts, several rules are laid down. 
Apart from the daily duty to make gifts (Yaj. I. 203 ) gifts 
had to be made on special oooasions and if so made were more 
meritorious than the gifts made daily. Laghu-Satatapa (145-153)

says t00> that a gift must be made on the first day of each ayana 
( the sun's passage to the north or south ), at the beginning of 
Sadaslti and while an eclipse of the sun or moon is in progress 
and that the rewards of the gifts made on these occasions are 
inexhaustible. Vanaparva 200. 125 is to the same effect. A 
gift made on Amavasya imparts rewards a hundred times ( of 
the reward of making it on any ordinary day), a thousand times 
when made on the suppression of a tithi, a hundred thousand 
times when made on the equinootial day and a gift brings 
endless rewards when made on VyatlpSta. Samvarta (208-209) 
says that gifts made on the ayana day, equinoctial day, vyatl- 
pata, the suppression of a tithi and on the eclipses of the sun 
and moon, on new moon day, 12th day, samkranti (sun's passage 
into a zodiacal sign) becomes inexhaustible and these tithis are 
highly commended and so also Sunday for a bath, japa, noma, 
dinner to brahmanas, fast and gifts. 2010 Satfitapa ( 146) states 
that 16 ghatikas before and also after the moment when the sun 
enters a new zodiaoal sign is the holy time for gifts, while 
others give 30 ghatikas ( before and after ) for Karkataka 
(Cancer samkranti), 20 for Makara (Capricorn) and 105 for Tula 
(Balance) and Mesa (Aries). VisvarQpa on Yaj. 1.214-217 
states that the times specified as the proper ocoasions for sraddha 
are all of them the most appropriate times for making gifts. 
Vide Fraj&pati 25 and 28 and Atri 327 for similar rules. Sankha 
says that if amavasya falls on Monday, the 7th tithi on 
Sunday, 4th on Tuesday, 8th on Wednesday— these four are like

eclipses and so gifts made on these days yield infinite rewards 
( quoted by Hemadri, danakhanda p. 66 ). The Visnu Dh. S. 
chap. 89 deals with the rewards of the gifts of various articles 
made on the full moon days of the twelve months of the year. 
Anusasana chap. 61 speaks of danas on the 27 naksatras 
from krttika. 

The general rule was that gifts were not to be made at 
night. But there are several exceptions. Atri 327 states that 
a gift even at night is commended on the occasions of eclipses, 
marriages, samkrantis and the birth of a child. Devala 8011 
quoted in Par. M. I. part I, p. 194 has a similar verse and the 
Par. M. adds that only on the Cancer and Capricorn samkrantis 
are gifts allowed to be made at night. 

The above rules about the special occasions for gifts are 
amply borne out by epigraphic evidence. A few examples may 
be cited. A very large number of grants on copper and stone 
relate to gifts of lands and villages at the time of solar eclipses. 
For example, vide Tiwarkhed plate of Eastrakuta Nannaraja 
dated iake 553 (653 ? ) in E. I. vol. XI. p. 279, I. A. vol. VI, 
p. 73 ( in iake 534 i. e, 613 A. D. ), the grant of 30 nivartanas 
of land purchased for 30 gadyanakas of gold on a total eolipse 
of the sun in 754 A. D. in the time of Calukya Klrtivarman II 
( E. I. vol. III. p. 6 ), E. I. vol. III. p. 193 ( of iake 716 ), 
E. I. vol. IX, p. 100 ( in 660 A D. ). Grants on the occasion of a 
lunar eclipse are found in J. B. B. It. A. S. vol, 20, p. 135 
( Navsari plates of Eastrakuta Mahasamanatadhipati Karkaraja 
issued in iake 738, i. e. 817 A D. ), in E. I. vol. I. p. 341 (Patna 
Inscription of the time of Yadava Singhana dated sake 1128 i. e. 
1207 A.D.), E.I. vol. 19, p. 41, E.I. vol. 20, p.'125 (in safhvat 1108). 
Grants on ayana days may be seen in I. A. vol. 12, p. 193 
(Haddala plates of the Capa Mahasamantadhipati Dharanl-varaha 
issued in sake 836 ), the Safijan grant of Amoghavarsa dated 
iake 793 (Uttarayana-Mahaparvani). Grants on Samkrantis are 
found in E. I. vol. VIII. p. 182 ( Dhulia plate of Karkaraja 
dated 'iake 701), E. L vol. XII. p. 142 (in 1087 A D. ), 
E. I. vol. VIII. p. 159 ( in samvat 1207 ). It may be noted 
that not only on the sun's passage in a rasi, but even on 
Jupiter's passage in a rasi ( Taurus in this oase ) a grant was 
made as seen in Lucknow Museum plate of Klrtipala ( E. I. 
vol. VII, p. 93 in safiivat 1167 i. e. 1111 AD.). A village was

granted on Visuvasamkranti to a brahmana in honour of Buddha 
by Mahlpala I, a-king of Bengal (vide E. I. vol. XIV, p. 324). 
For grants on Aksaya Trtlya (3rd of the bright half of Vaisakha) 
vide E. I. vol. 14, p. 198 ( when 32 villages were granted to 500 
brahmanas in samvat 1156) and E. I. vol. VII. p. 98 (Lar 
plates of Govindacandra of Kanoj in samvat 1202 ). For a grant 
made on Mahakartikl (the full moon day of Kartika) vide E. I. 
vol. X, p. 75 ( which is a grant to several brahmanas for ena - 
bling them to offer bait, caru, vaiivadeva, agnihotra and the five 
mahuyajflas, in Kalacuri samvat 292 i e. about 540 A. D. ). 

The places ( deka) where gifts are to be made are also speci- 
fied in the smrtis, puranas and digests. Gifts E0,B made in the 
house yield ten times as much merit ( as when made elsewhere), 
a hundred times when made in a oowpen, a thousand times 
when made in sacred places ( firthas ) and an infinite number of 
times when made near an image (or linga) of Siva. The Skanda- 
purana s01J quoted by Hemadri ( dana p. 83) states that Benares, 
Kuruksetra, Prayaga, Puskara (Aimer), the banks of the Ganges 
and of the ocean, Naimisa forest, Amara-kantaka, Srlparvata, 
Mahakala (at Ujjayinl), Gokarna, Veda-parvata — these and 
the like are deolared to be holy places resorted to by gods and 
siddhas', all mountains, all rivers and the ocean are holy ; the 
habitations of cows, siddhas and sages are also holy; whatever 
is donated in these sacred places confers infinite reward. 

When making a gift of anything one has to pour water on 
the hand of the donee. Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 9-10 801 * states that all 
gifts are to be made with water exoept in the case of vedio 
sacrifices where they are to be made as directed by the vedic 
texts. Gautama V. 16 says the same. In the case of all gifts 
they are to be accompanied by a separate daksina. The Agni- 
purana M,s 211. 31 makes an exception in the case of gifts of

gold, silver, copper, husked rice, com, daily sraddha and daily 
devapuja ( which may be without daksina ). That daksina should 
consist pre-eminently of gold, but if gold itself is the article 
donated then the daksina may be of silver. In the case of very 
costly gifts like tulapurusa, the daksina may be one hundred or 
fifty or 25 or ten mskas or one-tenth of the price of the thing 
gifted or according to ability. 

Hemadri ( Dana pp. 96-97) and Danaraayukha (pp. 11-12 ) 
quote verses from the Visnudharmottara stating the presiding 
deities of the several articles that are donated ( such as Agni of 
gold, Prajapati of dasas, Rudra of cows &c. ) and adds that 
wherever no presiding deity is specifically named Visnu is the 
presiding deity. Those very verses are quoted as from the Kapila- 
pancaratra in the DanakriyakaumudI (p. 5). The Agnipurana 
( 209. 40-48 ) has similar verses. This notion is derived from the 
Brahmapas and Srautasutras which speak of Rudra as the pre- 
siding deity of the gifts of cows, Soma of garments, Prajapati of 
human beings and so on ( vide Tai. Br. II. 2. 5, Ap. Sr. 14. 11. 3 ). 

The general procedure of making gifts may be stated here 
once for all. The donor and the donee should have taken 
their bath and should wear two white garments each, the donor 
should wear a pavitra, perform acamana, should face the 
east, should wear the sacred thread in the upavlta form, 
be seated on a pure seat (of kusa &c- ) and seat the donee 
on a seat and make him face the north, then the donor should 
utter the name of the subject of gift, its presiding deity 
and the purpose for which he makes the gift, and say 

• I make a gift to you of such and such an article, * 
pour water on the donee's hand, and when the donee says 

* give * the donor should sprinkle water on the subject of gift 
and place it into the hand of the donee, who utters the syllable 
•om' and says 'svasti'. Then daksina is given to the donee.

have to be made as to the statement of the occasion, the reoeipt 
of the subject of gift &o. ( if it is land or a house, it cannot be 
received in the hand ; the donee simply walks round it or on it 
or enters it ). 

YSj. I. 133 prescribes that the king should daily make gifts 
to brahmanas learned in the Veda, of milch cows, gold, land, 
houses and the requisites of marriage ( i. e. maidens, expenses 
of marriage &o. ). This was nothing new that was prescribed 
by Yaj. It has been followed for ages by the kings. The 
Vanaparva 8017 186. 15 states that he who makes a gift of a 
maiden in the brahma form or of land enjoys bliss in the world 
of Indra. We find from the inscriptions of Usavadata so18 (pro- 
bably in the 1st oentury A. D.), son-in-law of Nahapana, at Karle 
and Nasik that he gave 3 lakbs of cows, 16 villages to gods and 
brahmanas, fed one lakh of brahmanas every year, got eight 
brahmanas married at his own expense at Prabhasa ( in 
Kathiawar ), built flights of steps on the river Barnasa, con- 
structed quadrangles, houses and halting places (pratiiraya) 
at Bharukaccha (modern Broach), Dasapura (in Malwa), 
Govardhana (Nasik) and Sorparaga (modern Sopara), con- 
structed wells and tanks ; kept free ferry boats over the rivers 
IbS, Parada, Damana, Tapl, Karabena, Dahanuka ( all between 
Thanaand Surat); established meeting halls and shelters for 
gratuitous distribution of water ; conferred 32000 oocoanut trees 
in Nanangola (modern Nargol) on the assembly of brahmanas 
of the Oaraka Sakha at Bamatlrtha in Sorparaga and three other 
places. He adds that he purchased from a brShmana for 
4000 karsapanas a field that originally belonged to the brahmana's 
father and made a grant of it for supplying food to the assembly

Oh. XXV ] DSnarfor settling brdhmaxuxs 857 

of monks coming from all quarters that dwelt in the cave 
constructed by him. This is certainly a formidable list of 
benefactions for one ruler. 

As to spending money for the marriages of brahmanas and 
settling them as householders, a few words may be said here. 
Daksa 80, » III. 32-33 says 'The merit of him, that establishes a 
brahmana who is without father or mother by performing his 
samskaras and by getting him married, is beyond reokoning' 
A man does not secure that bliss by observance of agnihotra or 
the performance of Agnistoma, which he seoures by establi- 
shing a brahmana in life'. Apararka (p. 377) quotes a long 
passage from the Kalikapurana about Naiveiika dana. Its 
purport is briefly as follows : ' The donor should choose eleven 
brahmanas of srotriya families ( devoted to the study of the 
Veda) and of good character and conduct, should build eleven 
houses for them, should get them married at his expense, should 
furnish the houses with stores of corn, with cattle and maid 
servants, beds, seats, vessels of clay and copper and other 
utensils for taking food and with garments ; and having thus 
furnished the houses, should settle the eleven brahmanas in the 
eleven houses and for their maintenance bestow upon each one 
hundred mvartanas of land or a hamlet, or half a village ; he 
should induce the brahmanas to be agnihotrins. By so doing 
he secures all the merit that is secured by the performance of 
sacrifices, vratas, various danas or pilgrimages to sacred places 
and enjoys in heaven all pleasures. A man who is unable to 
do as much as above may settle only one brahmana according to 
his means and he secures the same rewards '. In the Epigraphic 
records there are numerous instances of kings spending for the 
marriages of brahmanas. For example, the Aphsad Inscription 
of Adityasena ( vide G-upta Inscriptions No. 42, p. 203 ) speaks 
of gifts of agraharas on the marriages of one hundred brahmana 
girls to brahmanas. A copper-plate grant of the Silahara 
prince Gaudaraditya speaks of the king having got 16 brah- 
manas married at his expense and of having created endow- 
ments of three nivartanas for each for their maintenance at the 
time of their marriages (vide J. B. B. R. A. 8. vol. 13, p. 1, 
dated 1032 iake). As the brahmanas were supposed to lead a

life of comparative poverty, plain living and high thinking 
and aa they were the inheritors, preservers and transmitters of 
the saored literature of the country, as they also engaged in 
teaohing without stipulating for any fee, the State that had in 
those days no settled educational system as in modern times 
deemed it its duty to provide the resources which would enable 
the brShmanas to carry on their self-imposed task. Yaj. II. 185 
deolares that the king should set apart in his capital a place 
for the habitation of brShmanas learned in the Veda, should 
establish them there, should provide means of maintenance for 
them and then say to them 'follow your duties' (svadharma). 
Apararka quotes (p. 792) thereon from Brhaspati several verses 
that add 'the king should bestow on the brahman as who are 
learned and kindle the sacred fires (agnihotrins) houses and 
lands under his own edicts from which no taxes in the present 
or future would be levied. The brahmanas so settled should 
perform for the citizens their religious rites whether daily or to 
be performed on occasions or kamya or for averting evil omens 
or for the sake of prosperity and should give decisions in the 
cases of doubts. They should make rules and conventions for 
the whole village or for corporations and guilds and for reli- 
gious purposes. Those rules must be observed and when there 
is trouble caused by rogues and thieves all must join to put it 
down and that object must not be left to one person.' * 080 These 
prescriptions indicate what benefit was expected of the marriages 
and settlement of learned brahmanas. Kaut. II. 1 also pres- 
cribes that lands free from taxes and fines should be settled 
upon purohttas, srotriyas &c. There is nothing peculiar to 
India or to the caste system in this. Among the numerous 
oharitable purposes mentioned in the preamble to the Statute of 
Elizabeth (43 Eliz. chap. 4) which (preamble) is even now 
applicable in England ' the marriage of poor maids ' is one. 

The gift of land has been eulogized as the most meritorious 
of all gifts from ancient times. Vas. Dh. S. 29. 16 quoteB a 
verse whioh is found also in Brhaspati 7, Vismudharmottara

Mahabh&rata ( Anusasana 62. 19) and which says ' whatever mi 
sin a man may commit when in straitened circumstances, he 
is purified therefrom by making a gift of only as much land as 
is equal to gocarma'. Apararka (pp. 368, 370) quotes many 
verses from the Vi?nudharmottara, the Adityapurana, the 
MatsyapurSna on the high rewards reaped by the gift of land. 
The Vanaparva 80E2 ( 93. 78-79 ) declares ' whatever sins a king 
is guilty of in bringing the earth under his control, all those 
he gets rid of by performing sacrifices with munificent gifts ; 
by bestowing on brahmanas lands and cows in thousands, the 
king becomes free from all sins as the moon is freed from 
darkness' ( Rahu ). Anusasana 59. 5 voices the popular 
sentiment that ' gifts of gold, cows and land save even the 
wicked '.

maintain one man for a year '. Vide Apararka p. 1225 and HemSdri 
( Vratakhanda, part 1 pp. 52-53) for soveral definitions of gocarma. The 
word nivartana is very anciout. Kant. (II. chap. 20) says thai danda 
is equal to four aralnit, ten dandas are equal to one rajju and 3 raj jus are 
equal to a nivartana (so that a nivartana iB 30 dandas). The Baud. Dh. S. 
(III. 2. 2-4) speaks of a brahmana who maintains himself by cultivating 
six nivartanas of land. A field of 100 nivartanas is mentioned inNasik

following rules: ' when a king makes a gift of land or bestows

cloth or on a copper-plate marked at the top with his seal and 
write down thereon the names of his ancestors and of himself, 
the extent ( or measurements ) of what is gifted and set out the 
passages (from smrtis) that condemn the resumption of gifts'. 
Visvariipa the oldest extant commentator of Yaj. states that the 
edict or order should also bear the names or signatures of the royal 
officers such as ajna, dutaka, the name of the place where the 
king's army is encamped &c. and that the names of women 
( such as the queen mother or queen ) should be mentioned, and 
that verses stating the result of resuming gifts made by former 
kings should find place in the edict. Apararka (pp. 579-580) 
quotes long extracts from Brhaspati and Vyasa on the same 
subject. Brhaspati says that a royal edict recording a gift of 
land should be executed on a piece of cloth or on copper-plate, 
should state the place (of issue) and (the names of) the king's 
ancestors, that it should be stated to last till the sun and moon 
endure, that it was not to be resumed or taken back and was 
to be free from all future taxes and that it was to go on to the 
sons and grandsons from generation to generation (of the donee), 
it should state that heaven would be the reward of the donor and 
those that continued the gift, that the result of the resumption of 
the gift would be hell for 60,000 years to the resumer and it 
should bear the king's seal, the year, the month, the fortnight and 
day and should bear the signature of the superintendents (royal 
officers). Vyasa after stating these requisites adds that the 
edict should be addressed to brabmanas and other respectable 
people, to the king's officers, to all householders and to all 
others including medas and candalas, that it should state that 
the gift is made for securing merit for one's parents and 
one's self. 

The thousands of copper-plate grants and inscriptions on 
stone published so far show that these directions contained in 
Yaj., Br. and Vyasa have been followed to the letter from at 
least the 5th century onwards. In the earliest inscriptions verses 
about the merit of gifts and the sin of resumption do not ocour. 
For example, in Gupta Inscription No. 8 ( pp. 36 fif ) dated 88 of 
the Gupta Era ( i. e. 407-8 A. D. ) of Chandragupta II the only 
words ( in prose ) are ' whoever would cut off this charitable gift 
would be guilty of the five great sins'; similarly in the Gupta 
Inscription No. 5 (p. 32) dated Gupta era 93 the words are 
• whoever would destroy this charity now set on foot would be 
guilty of the murder of brahmanas and cows and of the five 



862 History of Dharmaidstra [ Ch. XXV 

sins that bring immediate punishment '. In the Inscriptions of 
the early Pallava king Sivaskandavarman also ( E. I. vol. I 
p. 7 ) such verses are not found. In the copper-plate grant of 
Skanda-gupfca (dated 146 Gupta year i. e. 465-66 A. D., Gupta 
Inscriptions' 08 * No. 16, p. 68 ) there is a verse on the point, but it 
is not one of those that are found in most inscriptions. 

In the earliest records verses lauding gifts and deprecating 
their resumption are few (one or two) but in later records their 
number increases. For example, in the copperplate of Maitraka 
Vyaghrasena (E. I. vol. XI, p. 221) there are only two verses and 
in the plates of Dhruvasena dated Gupta-Valabhi sarhvat 206 and 
210 respectively there are only two and three verses ( E. I. vol. 
XL pp. 107, 111 ), while there are 16 verses in an inscription of 
Yasahkarnadeva dated in Ealaouri samvat 823 ( E. I. vol. XII 
p. 205 ) and 15 verses in the copperplate grant of Cahamana 
Ratnapala dated in Vikrama samvat 1176 ( E. L vol. XI, pp. 
312-313 ). In most of the inscriptions containing these lauda- 
tory and imprecatory verses, they are cited as from Vy&sa or 
Manu or from smrti in general. In the Appendix ms a 
list of about forty such verses is given and in the footnotes 
it is pointed out wherever possible from what smrti or other 
source they are taken and a reference is made to some of the 
earliest inscriptions and grants where they occur. The 
references will show that these verses occur in inscriptions from 
all parts of India. Two of the most usual verses are : ' the 
earth was donated by many such kings as Sagara and others ; 
whatever king is lord of the earth at any particular time enjoys 
the reward ( merit ) of the gift of that land. The donor of land 
enjoys bliss in heaven for sixty thousand years and he who

some verses relating to gifts of lands in land grants. He deals with 
only seven verses and refers only to the PurBnas and the MahBbhSrata. 
In my notes ( in the appendix ) an attempt has been made to trace 
some of them to the smrtis. It is quite possible to traoe more of these 
verses in the smrtts if a more thorough search were made than I could 
find time to make.

destroys ( or resumes ) it or who abets the destruction dwells in 
hell for the same period.' In spite of such imprecations it 
appears that lands donated by former kings were sometimes 
confiscated by their successors. For example, in an inscription 
of IndrarSja III dated iake 836 it is stated that the king 
restored four hundred villages that had been confiscated by 
former kings ( E. I. vol. IX, p. 24 at p. 33 ' purvaprthvlpala- 
viluptani ) ; in the Talmanchi plates of Calukya Vikramaditya 
I ( dated 660 A. D. ) there is a recital that \he re-established the 
endowments of temples and brahmanas that had been lost in the 
three kingdoms' ( E. I. vol. IX. p. 100 ). The RajataranginI 
( V. 166-170 ) states that king Sarakaravarman ( in the first half 
of the 10th century ), the son of Avantivarman, deprived 
temples of all their properties for replenishing his treasury 
emptied by his vices. 80 ' 6 ParSsara ( XII. 51 ) says that the sin 
of resuming land already donated cannot be expiated even by 
performing a hundred Vajapeya sacrifices or by the gift of 
millions of cows. In the Khoh plates of Parivrajaka Maharaja 
Samksobha ( Gupta Inscriptions No. 25 p. 115 ) dated Gupta 
samvat 209 ( 028-529 A. D. ) there is a peculiar curse pronounced 
on him who would interfere with his gift ' him who would 
interfere with this gift I shall, though functioning in another 
body ( on aocount of rebirth ), consume ( bum ) with terrible 
ourses ( or impreoatory thoughts )'. Vide also Gupta Ins. No. 
23 p. 107 of G. S. 191. When a grant of a village or villages 
was made kings excepted therefrom grants already made in 
favour of shrines of gods and brahmanas. For example, in the 
Pikira Grant of Simhavarman ( E. I. VIII. p. 162 ) it is stated 
' this village is granted by us as a gift to brahmanas excepting 
the cultivated lands given as endowment to gods ' ( devabho- 
gahalavarjam ). In E. I. vol. X p. 88 ( of 697 iake ) the grant 
exoludes ' the portion already bestowed on gods and brahmanas ' 
( purvapratta-deva-brahma-daya-rahitah ). The grant of the 
village by the Candella king Paramardideva in sam. 1236 
expressly excludes five balas ( land measure ) of land granted to 
Buddha ( i. e. to a temple of Buddha then existing ). Vide E. I. 
XX. at p. 129. This shows that a Hindu king respected an 
endowment already made to a shtine of Buddha or to a 
monastery of Buddhists ( devasrl-buddha-satka-paiicahalam

( plates of Bhoja dated safit. 1079 where the expression ' deva- 
brahmana-bhuktivarjam ' occurs); E. I. vol. II p. 360 (sam- 
1162 ); E. 1. 14, p. 194 ( mm. 1150 ); E. I. vol. I, p. 85 at p. 88 
( G. S. 334 ). There are many instances where kings making 
grants of a field say that they purchased it from the owner 
and then bestowed it. For example, in E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 there 
is a grant by Kumaragupta ( G. S. 193 ) of this character and 
see p. 856 above where such a grant is referred to. Even in the 
most ancient grants what is granted is set out with great parti- 
cularity. A few examples will show this. In the Nasik Inscrip- 
tion No. 3 of Vasithlputa 8027 Siri-Pulumayi ( E. I. vol. 8 p. 65 ) 
the grant is in these words ' And to this village of S&malipada 
( Salmalipadra ) we grant the immunity belonging to monk's 
land, making it not to be entered by royal officers, not to be 
touched ( by any of them ), not to be dug for salt, not to be 
interfered with by the district police, ( in short ) to enjoy all 
kinds of immunities '. So also the Mayidavolu plates ,088 of the 
Pallava Sivaskandavarman state ( E. I. vol. VI, p. 87 ) ' to this 
village of Viripara we grant all the immunities enjoyed by the 
brahrnadeyas. Let it be free from digging for salt, free from 
being interfered with by the district police ( or officers ), free 
from supply of bullocks in succession, free from the entrance of 
soldiers, free from supply of boiled rice, water pots, cots and 
lodgings, with these and all other immunities prescribed ( by 
rules) regarding all brahmadeyas, we have caused it to be 
exempted*. In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 55, p. 235 (the 
Chammak copperplate of Pravarasena II ) B0M there are numerous 
words about the various taxes and exaotions remitted which it 
is difficult to understand at this distance of time, but some of

which, may be stated ' it was to be free from taxes, not to be 

entered by the regular soldiers, nor by catas, it was to be 

entirely free from all obligations of forced labour, it was to 
carry with it hidden treasure and all deposits. ' 

It is often stated in the grants that lands or villages are 
granted with the eight bhogas (vide B. I. vol. VI. at p. 97, the 
Gadag Ins. of Hoysala Vlra-Ballaja in iake 1114). The eight 
bhogas are enumerated in some of the inscriptions themselves. 
In the Srlsaila plates of Virupaksa (of iake 1388) they are 
stated to be nidhi ( treasure trove ), niksepa ( what is deposited on 
the land ), vari ( water), asman (stones, mines), aksinl ( actual 
privileges), agami (future profits), siddha (what is already 
brought under cultivation), sadhya (waste land that may in 
future be turned into cultivable land ). 80M In the times of the 
Marathas when lands or villages were granted it was usual to 
put in such words as ' jalataru-trna-kastha-pasana-nidhi-niksepa ' 
( water, trees, grass, wood, stones, treasure-trove and deposits). 
It has been decided by the modern Indian Courts that these 
words conferred on the grantee ownership in the soil itself and 
that in the absence of these words it is possible to hold that the 
grant was only of the royal share of the revenue and not of the 
soil itself. 80 * 1 

The question whether the king is the owner of all land in 
his kingdom has been discussed from very ancient times. 
Jaimini (VI. 7. 3) states the proposition that in the Visvajit 
sacrifice ( where the sacrificer has to donate everything that 
belongs to him ) even the emperor cannot make a gift of the 
whole earth of which he may be the ruler, since the earth is 
common to all ( to the sovereign as well as to those who cultivate

it and make use of it ). Sahara 80 '* elaborates this hy adding that 
others have as much right over the earth as the emperor, that 
the emperor is entitled to a share of crops produced from the 
earth as his since he protects them ; but that all other persons 
also walk on the earth, produce crops on it, get their sustenance 
from it and so they also have rights over the earth and therefore 
there is no difference between the emperor and other persons as 
to rights over the earth. This view is relied upon by the 
Vyavahararaayukha' 088 which says ' therefore it is said in the 
6th chapter of Jaimini that the whole earth oannot be given 
away by the emperor and a province by a feudatory chief. The 
ownership in the several villages and fields on the entire earth 
or in a province belongs to the holders of the land alone, while 
kings are entitled only to collect taxes. Therefore when kings 
now make what are technically called gifts of fields, no gift of 
land ( soil ) is effected thereby, but only provision is made for 
the maintenance of the donee (from the taxes which are 
alienated by the king). Where however houses and fields are 
purchased from the holders thereof ( by the king ) he has also 
ownership ( over the fields &c. ) in those cases and he in such 
cases secures the full merit of the gift of land ( if he makes a 
gift of such fields)'. These passages embody the important 
proposition that the state is not the owner of all lands, but is 
only entitled to levy taxes from the holders of land. 

There is another view also according to which the king was 
the owner of lands and the subjects were only occupants. This 
latter view, being more convenient and paying, has been adopted 
in modern times by the British Government in its policy and 
legislation ( e. g. vide section 37 of the Bombay Land Revenue 
Code, Bombay Act V. of 1879). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 318 
states ,0M that the words of Yaj. imply that the privileges of

Ch. XXV ] Dana-land grants 867 

making a gift of land or of a nibandha belonged only to the 
king and not to the governor of a provinoe or a district under 
the king. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 quotes a smrti 803 * 'land 
passes on the "happening of six circumstances viz. with the con- 
sent of one's village, of one's agnatic relations, of samantas, and 
of one's coparoeners and when accompanied with water and 
( daksina of ) gold ' and remarks that the consent of samantas 
( neighbours ) is only necessary as a safeguard against disputes 
about boundaries and that of the villagers is necessary for 
giving notice of the alienation to all. As the king is not men- 
tioned here, the king's consent does not appear to have been 
necessary for the gift of land by a private person. But it 
appears that the king's consent was sometimes sought for gifts 
by private persons and obtained e. g. in Gupta Ins. No. 31 p. 135 
Maharaja Sarvanatha ( G. S. 214 ) approves of a gift of two 
villages made to a person and his sons and grandsons in succes- 
sion for the worship of the goddess PistapurikadevI by a donee 
to whom they had been originally granted. 

On account of the great value attaohed to copper-plate 
grants as documents of title, there were great temptations to 
forge them. In the Madhuban copper-plate of Harsa ( E. I. vol, 
VII. p. 155 at p. 158 ) reference is made to a grant fabricated by 
a certain brahmana named Vamarathya about a village called 
Somakundaka. Manu IX 232 prescribes death as the penalty 
for fabricators of royal charters. Vide Fleet on ' Spurious 
Indian Records' in I. A. vol. 30, p. 201. 

From Manu and other smrtikaras it appears that so far as 
lands already brought under cultivation are concerned they 
appear to hold that the ownership of the land is in the culti- 
vators and the~king is only entitled to levy taxes for the 
protection he affords. In Manu VII. 130-132 it is stated 
'the king should take a fiftieth part of cattle and gold and a 
sixth, 8th or 12th part of the orops and a sixth part of trees, 
flesh, honey, ghee, perfumes, herbs, liquids, flowers, roots and 
fruits &o.' and in X 118 Manu allows the king to raise his 
demand in times of emergency to a fourth of the produce of 
land. Manu IX 44 states that a field belongs to him who 
uproots the stems of trees and shrubs from waste or unculti- 
vated land. Manu VIII. 39 provides that in anoient treasure-

868 History of LharmaiMra [ Ch. XXV 

trove found underneath the ground and in mines the king is 
entitled to a share because he affords protection and because he 
is lord of the earth. This militates against the view that the 
king is the owner of all lands, since, if that were so, Manu 
would have declared that the king took all the mines and 
treasure found in a cultivated field. In VIIL 243 Manu 
prescribes a fine for a oultivator not cultivating his field 
at the proper time or allowing the crops to be eaten up. But 
this would not make the king the owner, since the fine is 
imposed because the king is deprived of his share of taxes by 
the action of the cultivator. All these passages show that Manu 
held that the ownership of arable land was in the oultivator 
himself and the king was only entitled to demand a oertain share 
of the produce ( which is designated bhaga or kara as in Manu 
VII. 133). This is further supported by the conduct and praotioe 
of powerful but good kings who purchased lands from their 
holders when they wanted to donate lands already cultivated. 
It may be conceded that land that was waste or not cultivated by 
anybody was deemed to belong to the king. Manu (VII. 115-119) 
enjoins that the king should appoint a headman for a village 
and officers for ten, 20,100 and a thousand villages, that each of 
the preceding one was to report to the officer next above him 
about crimes and other matters, that the headman of a village 
was to take for his livelihood the perquisites ( such as food, fuel 
&c. ) that the king could daily demand from the villagers, and 
that the other officers were to be remunerated by grants of 
plots of land ( which when first granted must have been un- 
cultivated ). Kaut. II. 1 states that land prepared for cultiva- 
tion may be granted to cultivators who will pay a tax for life, 
that lands may be confiscated from those who do not cultivate 
them and may be given to others, that lands bestowed upon 
superintendents, accountants and similar persons as remunera- 
tion cannot be sold and mortgaged by them. For want of space 
this subjeot cannot be further pursued here. In modern times 
opinion has been sharply divided on the question whether the 
revenue from the land is in the nature of rent or is a tax. 
Baden Powell in 'Land Systems of British India' vol. I, 
pp. 240, 280 holds that land revenue is not rent but is a tax. In 
an elaborate judgment delivered by Sir Michael Westropp O. J. 
after exhaustively reviewing the original Sanskrit texts 
( pp. 30-39 ) and the works and reports of famous statesmen and 
writers such as Elphinstone, Munro, Mill and Wilson (pp. 39-53) 
the conclusion arrived at is stated to be that 'the proprietary

right of the sovereign derives no warrant from the anoient 
laws or institutions of the Hindus and is not recognized by 
modern Hindu lawyers as exclusive or incompatible with in- 
dividual ownership ' ( p. 53 ). :o! « 

The word agrahcira has been applied to the grant of lands or 
villages to brahmanas from very ancient times. It occurs 
frequently in the MahabhSrata e. g. Vanaparva 68. 4, Aarama- 
vasiparva 2. 2, 10. 41, 13. 11, 14. 14, 25. 5. Vide E. I. vol. I, p. 88 
(grant of the Valabhi king Dhruvasena III. in G. S. 334 i. e. 
653-654 A. D.) and in the Madhuban copper-plate of Harsa 
dated in the 25th year of his reign (i. e. 631, A. D., E. I. vol. I, 
p. 73 and VII at p. 158). 

Gifts of certain kinds are called Mahadanas. Aooording 
to the Agnipurana M3T (209. 23-24) the Mahadanas were ten, 
viz. gifts of gold, horses, sesame, elephants, maids, chariots, 
land, house, a bride, and a dark-brown ( kapild, ) cow. The 
Mahadanas are, however, usually enumerated as 16 in the 
puranas (vide Matsya, chap. 274-289, Agni. chap. 210, Linga- 
purSna II, chap. 28 fif). The sixteen mahadanas are: Tula- 
puruaa (weighing a person against gold or silver which is 
then distributed among brahmanas), Hiranyagarbha, Brah- 
m8nda, Kalpavrksa, Gosahasra, Kamadhenu ( or Hiranyakama- 
dhenu ), HiranySsva, Hiranyasvaratha (or simply Asvaratha), 
Hemahastiratha (or simply Hastiratha), Pancalaiigala, Dhara- 
dana(or Haimadharadana), Visvaoakra, Kalpalata (orMaha- 
kalpa- ), Saptasagara, Ratnadhenu, Mahabhutaghata. In the 
Lingapurana (Uttarardha, chap. 28 ff) the names are somewhat 
different. The names of these Mahadanas (of some at least) 
go back to centuries preoeding the Christian Era. The word 
'Mahadanani* occurs in the Mahabharata (Asramavasi-parva 
3. 31, 13. 15). In the Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela (2nd 
century B. C.) Kalpavrksa appears to be mentioned (E. I. 
vol XX, p. 79 ). Bana often refers to Mahadanas in general 
and Gosahasra in particular. mt It has already been shown (on

p. 856 ) how Usavadata made extensive gifts some of which fall 
under mahadanas. The Tulapurusa is very frequently spoken of 
in the Epighraphio records. The Cambay plates of the Rasfraku^a 
king Govinda IV (dated iake 852) state that the king was 
weighed against gold ( E. L vol. VII. p. 26 ). Vide also E. I. 
vol. XI p. 112 (in Dantivarma Ins. of iake 675), E. I. vol. IX, 
p. 24 ( Rastrakuta Indraraja III weighed against gold in iake 
836), E. I. vol. XI, p. 20 at p. 23 (Hematulft of Govindacandra 
mentioned in safa. 1186 ), E. L vol. XIV, p. 197 (dated sam. 1156, 
when 32 villages were given as daksinS after the two maha- 
danas of tulapurusa and gosahasra); E. I. vol. VII, p. 17 
( refers to tulapurusa of Krsnaraya of Vijayanagara in iake 1437). 
The tuladana is mentioned in the ancient Tamil work Silappadi- 
karam (vide p. 311 of Prof. Dikshitar's translation). .In E. I. 
vol. XII, atp.lOit is stated thatking Laksamanasena of Bengal 
granted a village as daksina when he performed the MahadSna 
called Hemasvaratha. The Sanjan plates of Amoghavarsa 
(dated iake 793) speak of the Hiranyagarbha mahadana per- 
formed by Danti-durga at UjjayinI (E. I. vol. XVIII, pp. 235, 238). 
In the Srlrahgam plates of Devaraya II of Vijayanagara dated 
sake 1350 it is stated that the prince gave a dinner to one lakh 
of br&hmanas at the holy place or Pray aga ( modern Allahabad) 
and on a lunar eclipse performed the Pafica-lahgala vrata 
(J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. XIII, p. 1 at p. 3 ). 

Brief notes will now be added for setting out the procedure 
of the mahadanaB. The Matsya-purana ( chap. 274-289 ) devotes 
about 400 verses to these. Aparfirka ( pp. 313-344 ) not only 
quotes almost all these verses of the Matsya-purana, but also 
adds further details from the Bhavisyottara-purana in certain 
cases. Hemadri ( DSnakhanda pp. 166-345 ) is far more elabo- 
rate and quotes ( in addition to the Matsya ) long passages from 
the Linga, Garuda and other puranas and from works on 
Tantra and the Agamas. The Danamayukha devotes pp. 86-151 
to the 16 mahadanas. The Matsyapurana ( 274. 11-12 ) states 
that the mahadanas were performed by suoh anoient heroes 
and kings as VSsudeva, Ambarlsa, Bhargava, Kartavlrya 
Arjuna, Rama, Prahlada, Prthu and Bbarata. It then gives 
general directions about the construction of the pandal (mandapa) 
required in making tbese mahadanas. The mandapa may be 
of various sizes, 16 aratnis ( one aratni being equal to 21 
angulas of the donor ) or 12 or 10 cubits ( one cubit being the 
length of the arm from the tip of the middle finger to the end 



Oh. XXV ] DmarTvJapuru^a 871 

of the elbow ), should have four doors and a vedi ( raised plat- 
form ) of seven or five cubits prepared with bricks, there was 
to be an arch on the vedi for holding the balance, it should 
have nine or five kundas mi ( pits in the ground for holding 
fire ) or one kunda, two auspicious water jars were to be placed 
at each door of the pandal, the tula was to have two posts and 
a cross beam of the same wood ( such as asvattha, bilva, palasa 
&c.) and was to be decked with golden ornaments. These 
details have to be passed over here for want of space. The rest 
of the procedure about tulSpurusa is briefly as follows ( Matsya, 
ohap. 274 ) : Priests knowing the four Vedas were to be placed 
on the four sides respectively ( viz. Rgvedins to the east, 
Yajurvedins to the south, Samavedins in the west and Athar- 
vanas in the north ). Then four homas were to be offered to 
Ganesa, the planets, the lokapalas, the eight Yasus, the Adityas, 
the Maruts, to Brahma, Visnu, Siva, the sun and the herbs and 
Vedio hymns referring to these were to be recited. 

At the end of the homa, the guru invokes with flowers and 
incense the lokapalas ( lords of the worlds or quarters ) with 
pauravika mantras, viz. Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna, 
Vayu, Soma, Isana, Ananta and Brahma. Then the donor should 
give golden ornaments, ear ornaments, golden chains, wrist- 
lets, rings, clothes to the priests and double ( what is given 
to each rtvik ) to the guru. Brahmanas should then recite the 
vedic hymn on santi ( propitiatary verses averting evil ). 80 * 
Then the donor again bathes and clad in white garments and 
wearing garlands of white flowers and having flowers in his 
folded hands invokes the balance that is supposed to be Govinda 
( Visnu ), and after per-ambulating the balance, he should step 

2039. There is a work oalled KundSrka by 6amkara, son of Nllaka- 
ntha, which in 15 stanzas succinctly gives all information about kuudas. 
They are of ten kinds, circular, lotus-like, crescent-shaped, yoni, trian- 
gular, quadrangular, pentangular to octagonal. The diagonal drawn 
from north-east to south-west may be one hasta, two hastas, four, 6 or 
eight according as the oblations to be offered are 1000 or more up to 
10,000 or from 10,000 up to a lakb, or from a lakh up to ten lakhs ( 4 
hastas ), from ten lakhs up to a crore ( six hastas ) and any number 
beyond a orore ( 8 hastas ). This extent is necessary for preventing the 
oblations from falling outside the kunda. Kundas of different forms 
were employed according to the rites performed. Vide HemSdri 
( dsna, pp. 125-134 ) for further details. 

2040. The hymn ' sam na indrSgnl ' Kg. VII 35. 1-15, in the first 13> 
verses of whioh the words 'sam nah ' occur at the commencement,

into one pan and in the other pan brShmanas should plaoe pure 
gold. Then the earth should be invoked and thereafter the 
donor should leave the balance and give half of the gold to 
the guru and the other half to the brShmanas, pouring water on 
their hands before doing so and he may also make grants of 
villages to the guru and other priests. Then he should honour 
brShmanas, other respectable people and the poor and helpless 
with gifts. One who performs this rite stays for innumerable 
years in the world of Visnu. The same procedure was applied 
to weighing a man against silver or camphor ( AparSrka 
p. 320, HemSdri, dSnakhanda p. 214). Apart from kings who got' 
themselves weighed against gold as shown above, lesser persons 
such as ministers sometimes indulged in this mahSdSna, as 
Candesvara, a minister of the Mithila kings, states with pride 
in his Vivadaratnakara ( vide H. D. vol. I, p. 370 ). 

Hiranyagarbha :— ( Matsya 275, LingapurSna II. 29 ). The 
preliminary prooedure about the pandal, the time, place, the 
materials, the punyShavSoana, the invocation of the lords of 
quarters is the same in this and the other mahadanas as in 
tulSpurusa. The donor should then bring forward a golden 
kunda ( basin or vessel ) 72 fingers high and 48 broad and 
having the shape of a muraja ( tabor ) but looking like the 
interior surface of a golden lotus ( with eight petals ). The 
golden vessel ( it is called Hiranyagarbha ) should be placed on 
a heap of sesame. Then the golden vessel is to be addressed 
with paurayika mantras, identifying it with Hiranyagarbha EMI 
( the Creator ). He should then enter the golden vessel, sit 
facing the north, hold in his hands golden images of Brahma 
and Dharmarftja and hold his head for five breaths between his 
knees ( to simulate the position of the foetus in the mother's 
womb ). The guru then repeats on the golden vessel the 
mantras of garbhadhana, pumsavana and slmantonnayana (and 
mentally revolves the other procedure of these); the guru 
thereafter makes the donor rise out of the golden vessel to the 
accompaniment of auspicious music Then the remaining 
twelve samskaras are 80 " performed symbolically on the donor, 

2041. Bg. X. 121. 1-10 is a hymn to Hiranyagarbha and begins 
' Htranyagarbhah samayartatSgre bbntasya jstah patir-eka Salt >. 

2042. HemSdii (dSna, pp. 230-231 ) quotes verses to the effeot that 
garbbAdSna is to be imitated by sprinkling the jniee of dUrvB in the 
right nostril of the donor, slmantonnayana by the presenoe of the 
fruit of udumbara ( as in that rite), annaprffsana by feeding brShmanas 
with plym (rioe cooked in milk ) and eo on. 



Oh. XXV ] JXna-Mahadanas 873 

who repeats the mantra to Hiranyagarbha and says ' formerly 
I was born from my mother but only as a mortal , now being 
born of you I shall assume a divine body.' Then the donor, 
seated on a golden seat, is bathed with the mantra 'devasya tva* 
( vide above note 653a ) and he distributes the golden vessel 
among the guru and other priests. 

Brahrriawja :— (Matsya 276). In this dana, two vessels (pans) 
of gold are to be prepared resembling the two halves of a 
hemisphere (to represent the dome of heaven above and the earth 
below ). The two halves are to be made of gold weighing from 
20 palas to a thousand according to the donor's ability and their 
length and breadth should be from 12 to 100 fingers ; the pans 
should have ( golden ) figures of the eight diggajas, the vedas 
and six angas, of the eight lokapalas and of brahma in the 
middle of them, of Siva, Visnu, the sun on their top, of UmS 
and Laksral, of Vasus, Adityas and Maruts inside ; the two 
should be covered with a silk garment and placed on a heap of 
sesame; eighteen kinds of corn should be arranged round them. 
Then in the eight quarters from the east golden images of 
Anantasayana ( Visnu lying on the snake ), Pradyumna, 
Prakrti, Samkarsana, the four vedas, Aniruddha, Agni, Vasudeva 
should be respectively arranged. Ten jara covered with cloth 
should be placed near ; gifts of ten cows with golden-tipped 
horns, with copper vessels (for milking them) and covered 
with garments should be made and gifts of sandals, umbrellas, 
seats, mirrors should be made and the golden pans ( called 
Brahmanda ) should be addressed in pauraqika verses and the 
gold should be distributed to the guru and priests ( 2 parts to the 
guru and one part to each of eight priests ). 

Kalpapadapa or Kalpavrksa . — ( Matsya 277, Linga II. 
chap. 33 ). A golden tree is to be manufactured with several 
fruits hanging down from it and with many ornaments and 
clothes. The gold may be from three palas to a thousand 
aooording to one's means. From half of the gold the Kalpa- 
padapa is to be prepared and placed on a heap ( prastha is a 
measure of 32 palas ) of jaggery, with images of Brahma, Visnu 
and Siva and the sun and five branches and the other four 
trees, Santana, Mandara, Parijataka and Haricandana are to 
be made each from \ of the one half of the gold taken and 
planted respectively in the east, south, west and north. Under 
the Kalpavrksa, figures (golden) of Kamadeva (the god of 
lore ) and his four wives are to be placed. Eight jars filled 



874 History of DharmaiSstra t Oh. XXV 

with water and covered with silk olotb and surrounded by 
lamps, ohowries, umbrellas are to be arranged and 18 dhanyas m< 
also; prayers are to be offered to the Kalpavrkaa to ferry the 
donor over the ocean of samsara ; then the kalpavrksa is to be 
donated to the guru and the other four trees 80u to four priests. 
Apar&rka ( p. 326 ) quotes Bhavisyottara to the effect that a 
sonless man or woman should make this mahadana. 

Oosahasra :— (Matsy a 278, Linga II. 38). The donor 
should subsist for three days or one day on milk alone and then 
the preliminary procedure of invoking lokapalas, punyahava- 
oana, homa etc. should be gone through. Then fragrant 
substances should be applied to the body of a bull made to stand 
on the altar and ten cows out of 1000 should be seleoted. They 
should be covered with clothes, have their horns gold-tipped 
and the hoofs tipped with silver and these cows should be 
brought inside the pandal and honoured. A golden image of 
Nandikesvara ( Siva's bull ) having golden bells round its neck, 
covered with silken oloth, scents and flowers, with horns gold- 
tipped, should be placed in the midst of the ten cows. The 
donor should bathe in water that is medioated with the herbs 
called sarvausadhi m< and with flowers in his folded hands 
invoke the cows with mantras expressing the greatness of cows 
and address the image of Nandikesvara as Dharma and should 
bestow the golden image of Nandl on the guru with two cows 
and donate one cow each to eight priests and to other brahmanas 
five or ten cows eaoh out of the remaining. The owner shoul d 
then subsist on milk alone for one day and should be continent 
that day. The donor would dwell in the world of Siva and 
would save his pitrs and maternal grand-father and other 
maternal ancestors. 

Kamadkenu :— ( Matsya 279, Linga II. 35 ). The figures of 
a oow and a oalf should be made from very pure gold, either 
one thousand or 500 or 250 palas in weight and one without 

2043. The following verse enumerates the 18 dhSnyas 'sTprrar-

The skin of a black antelope should be spread over the altar, 
thereon a prastha of jaggery should be kept and on it the golden 
cow should be placed being decked with jewels, surrounded by 
eight auspicious jars, fruits, eighteen kinds of grains, chowries, 
copper vessel, lamps, an umbrella, two silken garments, bells, 
neok ornaments &c. The donor should invoke the cow with 
paurayika mantras and then make a gift of the oow and calf to 
the guru. Hemadri ( danakhanda, pp. 265-274 ) quotes passages 
from the Matsya, Agni, and Linga puranas and from the 
KSmika and other works. 

Hirayyaiva : — ( Matsya 280 ). On the altar deer skin should 
be spread and sesame placed and a golden horse is to be made 
from gold of the same weight as in Kamadhenu and the donor 
is to invoke the image of the horse ( identified with the supreme 
God ) and the image is to be donated to the guru. Hemadri 
( danakhanda p. 278 ) adds that the horse figure is to have silver 
welded on in five places, 80 * 8 viz. the four feet and the mouth. 

Hirayyaivaratha: — ( Matsya 281 ). A golden chariot should 
be made with figures of seven or four horses, four wheels, a

umbrella, silken garments and cows according to one's means. 

Hemahastirathai — ( Matsya 282). A golden ohariot resem- 
bling a toy-oart should be made with four wheels, having figures 
of eight lokapalas, Brahma, Siva, the Sun, with Narayana, 
LaksmI and Pusti in the middle of it, on the fag-staff there 
should be an eagle and the figure of Ganesa on the end of the 
pole, there should be four golden elephants. Then it is to be 
invoked and donated. 

PaflcalMgalaka :— (Matsya 283). Five ploughshares should 
be made of some strong wood ( teak, sandal &c. ) and five of 
gold, ten fine oxen should be decked with gold on their horns 
and with pearls on their tails, silver on their hoofs and a gift of 
these and of land equal to one kharvata, kheta 80 * 7 or village or

a gift of one hundred or fifty nivartanas according to one's means 
should be made. A brahmana with his wife is to be honoured 
with golden chains, rings, silken garments, wristlets. 

Dharadana or Haimadharadana : — ( Matsya 284 ). A golden

Viivacakra : — ( Matsya 285 ). A wheel with 16 spokes and 
8 fellies should be made of gold, which may be in weight 
from 20 palas to a thousand palas according to one's means. On 
the first nave there should be the figure of Visnu in yoga 
posture, with the conch and cakra near him and the figures of

SaptaaSgaraka :— ( Matsya 287 ). Seven vessels ( kundas ) 
with a diagonal of either 10£ aiigulas ( pradesa ) or 21 aiigulas 
should he made from gold weighing from 7 palaa to a thousand 
palas according to one's means. The seven vessels should be 
respectively filled with salt, milk, clarified butter, jaggery, 
curds, sugar, holy water. In the several kundas golden images 
of Brahma, Visnu, Siva, the Sun, Indra, LaksmI and ParvatI 
should be dipped and all jewels should be thrown in them and 
all dhanyas should be arranged round them. A homa to Varuna 
should be performed and then the donor should invoke the 
seven oceans ( symbolized by the seven kundas ) and then they 
should be donated. 

Ratnadhenu : — ( Matsya 288 ). The figure of a cow is to be 
made of precious stones. 81 padmaraga ( ruby ) stones are to 
be placed in the mouth of that figure, a hundred pusparaga stones 
in the tip of her nose, a golden tilaka on her forehead, a hundred 
pearls in the eyes, a hundred pieces of coral on the two eyebrows, 
two pieces of mother-o'pearl represent the ears, there should be 
golden horns, and the head should be of one hundred diamond 
stones, with one hundred on her neck, one hundred sapphires 
on the back, a hundred lapis lazuli on the sides, crystal on the 
belly, a hundred saugandhika stones on the waist, hoofs of gold 
and tail of pearls and other parts of the cow's body are to be 
represented in a similar manner with various precious stones 
and the tongue with sugar and dung with jaggery, urine with 
ghee and a oalf is to be made with i of what is required for the 
cow and then both are donated. 

Mahabhutaghata .':— ( Matsya 289 ). A golden jar is to be set 
with precious stones with a diagonal of from 10£ aiigulas to 
100 aiigulas. It is to be filled with milk and clarified butter 
and on it figures of Brahma, Visnu and Siva are to be drawn 
as in the case of Kalparcksa, and the figures of the earth 
raised by the great boar, of Varuna on his conveyance of 
Makara, of Agni on a ram, of Vayu (on a deer), of Ganesa on 
a rat should be kept in the jar together with the figures of 
Itgveda having a rosary, Yajurveda holding a lotus, Sfimaveda 
holding a lute, Atharvaveda holding sruc and sruva ladles and 
Puranas ( the fifth veda ) holding a rosary and water jar. The 
golden jar then should be donated. 

Most of the smrtis highly extol the gift of a cow or cows. 
Manu IV. 231 states that the donor of a oow reaohes the world 



878 History of Dkarmaiaatra [ Ch; XXV 

of the Sun. Yaj. (I. 204-205 ), Agnipurana 210. 30 presoribe that 
when making a gift of a cow, she should have the horns and 
hoofs tipped with gold and silver respectively, she should be 
aooompanied with a bell metal vessel (for milking her) and she 
should be oovered with cloth, she should be mild in temper and 
the gift should be accompanied with a money payment and 
that whoever makes such a gift stays in heaven for as many 
years as there are hair on the cow's body. Vide Samvarta 
verses 71, 74-75 also. In the Anusasana-parva l0 " ( 51. 26-34 
and chapters 77, 78 and 81 ) there are frequent eulogies of cows. 
Anusasana 57. 28-29 are just like Yaj. I. 204-205. Anusasana 
(83. 17-18) explains that the cow is a constituent element of 
sacrifice, that the cow nourishes men ( with milk ), that their 
progeny ( the oxen ) are useful in agriculture and therefore cows 
deserve the highest praise. Apararka (p. 295-297) quotes 
numerous passages from the puranas eulogizing cows. Among 
cows kapila is the best for gift ( Anusasana 73. 42 and 77. 8 ). 
AnusSsana (77. lOff ) explains why the dark-brown cow (kapila) 
is the best. Yaj. I. 205 states that if the cow donated is kapila 
it saves (from sin) the donor's family up to seven generations 
(including himself ). Apararka p. 297 quotes Samvarta to the 
effect that the kapila cow is equal to ten ordinary cows. The 
Varahapurana chap. Ill deals with the gift of a kapila cow. The 
method of giving a cow is briefly as follows * 050 ( Hemadri, 
Danakhanda p. 451 ff, Danamayukha pp. 185-186): The cow 
is made to stand facing the east together with her oalf and is 
worshipped by the donor ( after having bathed and tied his 
top-knot) who sits near the tail and the donee Bits f aping

clarified butter in whiob a piece of gold is put. The tail of the 
cow is dipped into the butter and then taken out and placed into 
the right hand of the donee with the hair turned towards the east 
and also water, sesame and kusa grass are placed in the donee's 
right hand. The donor holds in his hand a vessel full of water 
from which he sprinkles water with paurmjika mantras, gives 
daksina and then the cow starts with the donee and the donor 
follows them a few steps and repeats certain verses eulogizing 
cows. The Agnipurana (210.34) speoially recommends that 
one who is at the door of death should make the gift of a cow 
( particularly a dark one ) who would enable him to oross the 
blazing river in the world of Yama called VaitaranI ( and henoe 
the cow is also called VaitaranI ).

attaoh special importance to the gift of a cow when she is just on 
the point of giving birth to a calf ( and therefore styled ' ubha- 
yatomukhl ) and the donor is said to stay in heaven as many 
years as the hair on the body of the cow and her calf. AparSrka 
(pp. 299-301 ) quotes a long prose extract from Cyavana on the 
procedure of this gift. When the head of the calf has appeared, 
the donor should say to the worthy donee ' accept this cow for 
conferring a favour on me and not because you desire this gift ' 
and repeat Rg. IV. 19. 6. Then taking hold of the cow with the 
formula ' ka idam kasma adat ' ( Atharvaveda III. 29. 7, As v. 
Sr. 5. 13, Ap. Sr. 14. 11. 2 ), the donor takes down the calf 
and recites in a loud voice Rg. IV. 27. 1 ('garbhe nu'). Then after 
kindling fire the donor repeats mantras addressed to the gods, 
pitrs, rivers, mountains, plants, seas, serpents, herbs respectively 
viz. Rg. I 139. 11, X 16. 12, X 75. 5, IX 75. 4, III. 8.

tiate the Earth with mantras ( addressed to the Earth ) viz. Rg. 
I. 112. 1, 1. 22. 13, 1. 185. 7, 1. 164. 41 ; the donor should offer

their benedictions in the terms of Rg. V. 51. 11 ('svasti no'). The 
gift of suoh a cow with the paraphernalia of gold or silver , 
fields, corn, clothes, salt and the like, sandal-wood, releases 
a man from the sins of eating or drinking forbidden food, 
brahmana murder, ineest &o. 

In imitation of the gift of the cow gifts of certain artioleswere 
made and they are also desoribed as dhenus. The Matsyapurana 
( chap. 82. 17-22 ) speaks of ten dhenus viz. of guda ( jaggery ), 
ghrta ( ghee ), tila ( sesame ), jala ( water ), kslra ( milk ), madhu 
( honey ), sarkara ( sugar ), dadhi (curds), rasa (other liquids) 
and godhenu ( cow itself ). It gives ( ohap. 82 ) a detailed des- 
cription of gudadhenu and adds that the liquid dhenus should be 
kept in jars and others should be in heaps, that the same 
procedure applies to all, and that some add suvarnadhenu, 
navanlta-dhenu (cow of butter) and ratnadhenu (cow of jewels). 
The Agnipurana ( 210. 11-12 ) enumerates the same ten dhenus. 
In the AnusSsana-parva 71. 39-41 the three dhenus of ghrta, tila 
and jala are mentioned. The Varahapurana ( chap. 99-110 ) 
describes in detail twelve dhenus, viz. all mentioned in the 
Matsya ( except ghrta and godhenu ) and navanlta, lavana 
( salt ), karpasa ( cotton ) and dhanya ( corn ). The procedure of 
all is more or less the same. Black antelope skin four cubits 
in length is to be spread on the ground that has been cowdunged 
and has darbhas strewn on it with the neck portion to the east 
( this represents the oow ) and a smaller skin is also spread ( to 
represent the calf ). If it is guda-dhenu it is made of 2 or 4 
bhftras ,0M and the calf is made with one fourth of that for the 
cow. Various articles such as conch shells, sugarcane pieces , 
pearls, ohowries, coral &o. are placed on the skin, to represent 
the various limbs of the cow, which is worshipped with dhupa 
( incense) and lamps and invoked with paurardka mantras. Then 
the articles are donated to a brahmana. Hemadri ( Dana, p. 
401 ) notes that according to the Padmapurana a single jar of 
liquids and one drona of solids constitute these dhenus, while 



2052. amr§> pp. 304-5 quotes n^rr 82. 17-22 and the following 
verses. Vide AparSrka p. 303 and Agnipnr&na 210. 17-18 from which the

Ob, XXV ] IMna-Dhenudam 88* 

the D&naviveka establishes that kumbha* " is equal to 1000 
palas and others hold that kumbha contains 512 palas. These 
several dhenus may be donated on eclipses, on the full moon 
days of Kartika and M&gha, on Yugadi days or when the 7th 
Uthi of a month falls on a Sunday and that the donor should 
subsist for three days on the substance to be donated, ApaT&rka 
pp. 303-313, Hemadri ( Dana. ) pp. 397-466, Danamayukha pp. 
172-184 dilate upon these dhenus, but all those details are 
passed over here for want of space. 

It appears that on account of the high merit associated with 
the gift of oows, donors sometimes passed old and weak 
cows on to donees. The Kathopanisad I. 1. 3 appears to contain 
a condemnation of such praotioes. 105 * " He who makes gifts of 
oows that simply drink water and eat grass, but yield no milk 
and do not possess strength ( to conceive and produce calves ) 
reaches those worlds called ' anandah ' (without delights)." The 
Mahabharata ( Anusasana 77. 5-6 ) echoes the very words of 
the Kathopanisad. In the Anusasana-parva 66. 53 80H it is said 
that one should not bestow on a brahmana a cow whioh is lean 
or is without her calf, which is barren and diseased, whioh is 
wanting in a limb or is exhausted. Hemadri (Dana, pp. 448-449) 
quotes this and other passages of similar import that state that 

2053. mv, stTOTT, cftr and *9fft are ancient measures of corn. 
Even Panini mentions some of these. Vide P5n. V. 1. 33 and V. 4. 110 
(for kh&ri), V. 1. 53 (for Sdhaka). Thf A p. Dh. S. II. 8. 20. 1 mentions 
drona. There was no unanimity as to their exact extent. AparKrka 
( p. 305 ), HemBdri ( Vratakhanda ) part I (p. 57), Par. M. II. parti, 
p. 141 quote versos ( the latter two say from Bhavisyapuraoa ) which 
give the following table: 2 <uys m jt^t^, 2 n^ffis = §ot, 4 533s = nw, 
4 shews = wre^Si 4 sniffs = rfH, 16 qfas - *rrtf. ParSdara VI. 70 says

equal to a khKrl and 20 dronas to a kumbha.

the man who makes a gift of such a useless cow enters into the 
darkness of hell. 

The Matsyapurana ( chap. 83. 92 ) speaks of ten kinds of 
danas called parvatadanas or merudanas, viz. of dhanya ( corn ), 
lavana ( salt ), guda ( jaggery ), hema ( gold ), tila ( sesame ), 
karpasa ( cotton ), ghrta ( ghee ), ratna ( preoious stones ), rajata 
( silver ), sarkara ( sugar ). The Agnipurana (210. 6-10) enume- 
rates these ten. Apararka (pp. 344-354) quotes all the chapters 
of the Matsya. Hemadri ( Dana, pp. 346-396 ) not only dilates 
upon these ten danas, but speaks of 12 of such danas from Saiva 
works like the Kalottara. These danas were called parvata, 
iatla or acala because the substances were heaped up like hills. 
The procedure in all of them is the same. A square platform 
inclined towards the north-east or east was to be prepared, 
smeared with cowdung and strewn with kusa grass. In the 
midst of it a heap was to be made to represent a mountain with 
smaller heaps to represent hills at the foot of the mountain. In 
the case of the mountain of dhanya, it is to be made with 1000 
or 500 or 300 drona measures of corn. Three trees of gold are 
to be planted on the middle of it and in the four directions lotus- 
like plants of pearls, gomeda and pusparaga, emeralds and 
sapphires, lapis lazuli respectively. Many more picturesque 
features such as gold and silver images of 81 gods are described 
in the Matsya. A guru and four priests are to be ohosen for 
homa and 13 ahutis are to be offered to each of the gods. In 
the gift of salt, from 1 to 16 dronas thereof are to be employed, 
in the gift of jaggery from 3 to 10 bharas, in that of gold from 
1 to 1000 palas, in that of sesame from 3 to 10 dronas, of karpasa 
from 5 to 20 bharas, of ghee from two kumbhas to 20, of ratnas 
from 200 pearls to 1000, with attendant hills of precious stones 
i of the pearls, of cotton from 20 palas to 10 thousand, of sugar 
from half a bhSra to 8 bharas. 

The smrtis, puranas and digests speak of the gifts of many 
animals such as of elephants, horses, buffaloes, of articles like 
clothes, deer-skins, umbrellas, shoes, which are all passed over 
here. But two or three of these many danas deserve notice. 
Apararka ( pp. 375-376 ) eztraots a long passage from the 
Bhavisyottara about constructing in the month of Oaitra a 
mandapa for the distribution of water to travellers in the midst 
of a city or in a waterless desert or near a temple. A brahman a 
was to be engaged for wages to distribute water and this was 
to be continued for four months or at least three fortnights, 



Oh. XXV 1 mnargifts of books 883 

Another important gift is that of manuscripts of the 
epios, dharmasSstras and puranas. Apararka (pp. 389-403) and 
Hemadri ( Dana, pp. 526-540 ) quote from the Bhavisyottara, 80 " 
Matsya and other puranas long extracts about the merit secured 
by making such gifts, the Matsya in particular also stating 
the number of verses in each of the 18 puranas. The Agnipurana 
also in speaking of the gifts of MSS. of puranas states 
the number of verses in each (chap. 273). The Bhavisya- 
purana states that books may be placed in a matha for the use of 
all people and that he who arranges for the reading of books 
in the temples of Siva, Visnu or the Sun reaps the merit of the 
gifts of cows, land and gold. E. I. vol. 18 p. 340 records a 
gift to a temple in which provision is made for the reading of 
the Mahabharata from a part of the income ( in Kerala in the 
11th century A. D. ). The Agnipurana 211. 61 eulogises also 
the gifts of the works called Siddhantas. 

In medieval and modern times gifts were and are made 
with a view to propitiate the planets. And this sentiment can 
be traced back to the days of the sutras. Gaut. 8057 XI. 15 
advises the king to perform the rites that experts in astrology 
and in portentous signs might indicate (as necessary) for 
averting evil consequences and states ( XI. 16 ) that according 
to some acaryas the welfare of the king depends upon the 
performance of such rites. The Asv. gr. (III. 12. 16) states 
that the purohita should direct the king to fight from the direc- 
tion or side on which the sun is or (if fighting at night) from 
the side on which Venus shines ( and not from a side opposite 
to them ). Yaj. (I. 295-308) deals with Grahasanti ( propitiation 
of planets). He states that he who desires prosperity, or the 
averting of calamities, or good rains, long life and health and 
also wants to harm his enemies by magic rites should perform 
a sacrifice; that the nine planets are the Sun, the Moon, Mars, 
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu ; that images

of the planets are to be made respectively of copper, crystal, 
red sandal-wood, gold (for both Mercury and Jupiter), silver, 
iron, lead and bell-metal or they may be drawn on a piece of 
cloth in these colours or may be painted in circles on the 
ground with colours ; that flowers and clothes may be offered to 
them of the respective colours described above ; fragrant sub- 
stances, incense of guggulu should be offered to them and 
oblations of cooked food may be made to them in fire with the 
following mantras respectively, viz. &g. I. 35. 2, Vaj. S. 9. 40, 
Rg. VIII. 44. 16, Vaj. S. 15. 54, Rg. II. 23. 15, Vsj. S. 19.75, 
$g. X. 9. 4, Vaj. S. 13. 20, $g- I. 6. 3. The fuel-sticks to be 
offered to the nine planets should respectively be of the following 
trees and plants: of arka plant, palSsa, khadira, ap&marga, 
pippala, undumbara, saml, durvB and kusa grass. 108 or 28 
samidhs of each of these should be thrown into the fire, they 
being anointed with honey, clarified butter, curds and milk. 
The foods on which the brahmanas are to be regaled at dinner 
in the grahayajfla are respectively rice mixed with jaggery, rice 
cooked in milk, havisya food (i. e. the food on which the 
ascetics live), corn that ripens in sixty days cooked in milk, 
curds, and rice, rice with clarified butter, rice mixed with 
crushed sesame, flesh ( with rice ), rice of various colours. The 
fee ( daksina ) to be paid should respectively be a milch oow, 
conch, a draught ox, gold, clothes, horse ( white ), dark cow, 
iron weapon, a goat. 'The rise and fall of kings depend upon 
the (aspects of) planets and the existenoe and destruction of 
the world depend upon planets; therefore the planets should be 
honoured the most ' — says Yaj. I. 308. 

The Matsya-purana mB in chap. 93 contains a detailed 
procedure of grahasanti and chapter 94. (1-9) desoribes how 
the images of the nine planets are to be represented. Vide 
Vaik. IV. 13 and also Baud. gr. aesa-sQtra I. 16 for a 
similar treatment. In modern times the dSnas ( articles 
donated) to propitiate the nine planets are those stated in the 

2058. The mantras of the nine planets slightly differ in the 
Matsya-jurana (93. 33-37) from those of Ysj. I. 300-301. Matsya 93, 
69-63 names the same daksinXs aa Ysj. and Aparffrka p. £75 quotes those 
reuses. All the nine verses of Matsya 94 are quoted by the Mit. on Tlj . 
I. 297-98. Tlj. probably meant to rely only on the Vsj. 8., but 
as some of the mantras ooour in the %., references to the latter hare 
been given.

Dharmasindhu 80M quoted below. The S. R. M. (pp. 123-164) 
contains a long.drawn procedure of Grahamakha, a rite to 
propitiate the planets. A Grahamakha is either nUya (on Visuva 
day, ayana day, birth naksatra), mimittika (to be performed 
on such oooasions as upanayana ) and kamya ( for removal of 
adversity &o. ) 

Apararka (pp. 365-366 on Yaj. I. 209) quotes a long passage 
from the Nandipurana about the founding of hospitals ( arogya- 
sala ) where medioines were supplied free to patients. * Since 
the four purusarthaa ( goals of life ) viz. dharma, artha, kama 
and moksa, depend upon health, he who provides for securing 
this may be said to have made gifts of everything.' The passage 
further states that a competent physician should be appointed. 
Hemadri (dana, pp. 893-95) quotes the same passage and another 
from the Skandapurana to the same effect. 

The smrtis prescribe that when a man accepts as a gift 
what he should not aocept, he incurs sin from which he becomes 
free by giving up the thing, by reciting certain vedio mantras, 
( like the Gayatrl ) and by tapas ( prayasoitta ). Vide Manu 
XL 193 ( = Visnu Dh. S. 54. 28 ). This sin is said to be due to 
'asat-pratigraha' which may arise either from the caste or 
aotions of the donor ( e. g. the donor may be a oandala or patita ) 
or from the time or place ( e. g. taking a gift in Kuruksetra or 
in an eclipse ) or from the objeot given ( such as a gift of wine 
or of an ewe, of the bed-stead of a deceased person or of the cow 
called •ubhayatomukhl*). Yaj. III. 289 and Manu XI. 194 
(= Visnu Dh. S. 54. 24) prescribe for asat-pratigraha the penance 
of staying in a cow-stable for one month subsisting on milk 
alone, observing complete celibaoy, repeating the Gayatrl 
mantra 3000 times every day. The donor, in the above oases, 
may incur no sin, but the donee does. The DanakriyakaumudI 
( pp. 84-85 ) quotes passages from several puranas condemning 
the acceptance of gifts on the Ganges and other saored rivers 
and places, and the gifts of elephants, horses, chariots, the beds

and seats used by the dead, black deer-skin, the cow called 
ubhayatomukhl. The Dsnaoandrika 8060 quotes the Padmapurana 
to the effect that a brahmana who is in great difficulty to main- 
tain himself may accept a gift on the banks of the Ganges and 
other sacred rivers, but should himself make a gift of the 
10th part of it and then he would incur no sin. 

We have already seen ( pp. 838-39 ) how even in the Rgveda 
various rewards are promised to those who make gifts of cows, 
horses, gold or clothes. The Tai. S.JI. 8. 4. 1 makes it a matter of 
give and take between gods and man ( dhehi me dadami te ni me 
dehi ni te dadhe ). The same sentiments and notions continued 
down to the latest ages and are re-inforced by further and very 
detailed promises of rewards for several kinds of gifts. Vas. 
Dh. S. 29. 2-27, Visnu Dh. S. 91-92, Samvarta verses 46-93 
may be read in this connection. 

A gift once completed by acceptance is irrevocable. Yaj. II. 
176 prescribes ' what is promised should be given and what has 
been donated should not be taken back '. Narada 10 ' 1 ( Datta- 
pradanika, verse 8 ) declares that the price of goods ( delivered ), 
wages, what is paid for pleasure ( derived from dancers &c. ), a 
gift made through affection, a gift made through gratitude ( for 
favours received ), money paid for a bride ( to her kinsmen ) and 
gifts for religious and spiritual purposes — these are given 
irrevocably. But a gift though promised was not complete and 
irrevocable in all cases. Gaut. V. 21 declares that a gift, 
though promised, need not be completed if the donee to whom 
it is promised is a person guilty of irreligious or improper 
conduct (such as visiting prostitutes). Manu VIII. 212 is 
similar in import. Katyayana states 2062 that if a man of his 
own free will promises a gift to a brahmana, but does not carry 
out that promise, he becomes a debtor ( to that brahmana ) in 
this world and the next. This means that a gift promised to a 
brahmana, though not completed by acceptance and delivery,

Gautama states ( V. 22 ) that the promises made by those 
who were carried away by rage or extreme joy or who were 
under a sense of dread or were ill or distressed or covetous or 
made by a minor ( under 16 ) or an extremely old man or by

amplifies this by stating 16 kinds of invalid gifts, viz. all 
those in Gautama ( except those due to joy and covetousnesB ) 
and also what is promised as a bribe, promises in jest, giving to 
a person mistaking him for another, gift induced by fraud or 
made by one who is not his own master, gift made to a man 
with the idea of getting something in return ( but who does not 
do so ), gift to a person who is unworthy, though he proclaimed 
himself to be worthy, and a gift for a purpose which is sinful. 
Katyayana ( quoted by Apararka p. 781 ) is just like NSrada 
and adds that if a man is in danger of life and promises the 
gift of all his wealth to whosoever may save him, he may resile 
from the promise. Apararka p. 782 quotes verses from Brhas- 
pati similar to Narada's. Manu VIII. 165 declares that a sale, 
mortgage or gift brought about by fraud, or every transaction 
in which a trick is played, may be set aside ( by the king ). 
Though a gift made by one who is ill or distressed ( arta ) is 
declared by Gautama to be revocable, Katyayana 2064 states an 
exception viz. that when a man whether in sound health or 
Buffering from a disease declares a gift for religious purposes 
and dies without completing it, then his son ( or other heir ) 
should be made to caray out that gift. This verse contains the 
germ of the idea of wills, since the mere declaration of the 
intention of a man to make a gift for religious purposes is here

made enforceable after his death. Apararka p. 782 conveys 
that the word ' son ' is only illustrative and that every heir 
taking the estate is liable to make good the promise of the 
deceased. 

In modern times a gift or beqnest for dharma without any 
qualifying expression is held to be too vague an indication of 
the donor's or testator's intention to constitute a valid gift to 
charity and is declared to be void for uncertainty. Vide 6 
Bom. 24, 14 Bom. 482, 17 Bom. 351, 23 Bom. 725, 735 (P. C). But 
this is opposed, as pointed out in 30 Mad. 340 at pp. 342-346, to 
the spirit of the ancient Hindu law. The word ' dharma ' when 
used in relation to gifts had a well-recognized meaning and not 
a vague uncertain one. It means ' ista ' and ' purta ' gifts 
according to Manu IV. 227. It appears that in 23 Bom. 725 
their Lordships of the Privy Council rested content with the 
meaning of the word given in Wilson's Dictionary, did not 
examine any original Sanskrit texts to find out the meaning of 
the word dharma used in connection with gifts and applied the 
principles laid down in such English cases as Morice v. The 
Bishop of Durham (9 Ves. 399 and 10 Ves. 522). But there is no 
reason why the charitable intention being quite clear the court 
as representing the king should not have by framing a scheme 
applied the property donated or bequeathed to one charitable 
purpose out of the several objects specified in the definition of 
purta on principles analogous to the dootrine of cy-prd$. tw

CHAPTER XXVI 

PRATISTHA AND UTSARGA 

Pratiqtha and Vtsarga (foundation of temples and dedica- 
tion of wells, tanks, parks &o. for the benefit of the public). 

The subjeot of gifts naturally leads on to the topics of 
pratitfte and utaarga. We saw above (p. 157 /. n. 370) how 
the construction of temples, wells and similar religious and 
charitable foundations and institutions was included under 
pfirtadharma and how sudras were entitled to perform such 
dharma. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 points 80 " out that women 
(and widows) were entitled to spend on purta objeots, though 
they were not authorized to perform ista dharma ( i. e. vedio 
sacrifices &c). Modern decisions have gone so far that a Hindu 
widow whose powers of alienating for secular purposes property 
inherited from her husband are very limited has been held to 
possess greater powers of alienation if the alienation be made 
for the spiritual benefit of her deceased husband and dedications 
by her of a small fraction of the property for the continuous 
benefit of the soul of the deceased owner have been upheld. 8067 
Such works of public utility have been highly recommended 
from very ancient times. Sahara ,0 ' 8 on Jaimini I. 3. 2 refers 
to the srarti rules about charitable objects which are based 
on such iruti passages as '0 Agni, who art anoient and a king, 
thou art to the man who desires to offer a sacrifice like prapa 
(shed where water is distributed to travellers) in a desert*. In

Rg. X. 107. 10 a puskarinl ( a tank ) is mentioned. The Visnu 
Dh. S. (chap. 91. 1-2) states ' one who digs a well ( for the public ) 
has ( the consequences of ) half his sins destroyed when the 
water has begun to flow forth ; one who dedicates a pond is 
forever happy ( free from thirst ) and attains the world of 
Varana.' Bapa in his Kadambarl ( para 44 ) 20M mentions that 
smrtis enjoined upon men the foundation (for public use) of halls, 
shelters, wells, prapas, gardens, temples, embankments, water 
wheels &e. Some sages went so far as to say that the reward of 
sacrifices is only heaven, but by purta ( consecration of temples, 
tanks and gardens) one secures release from mmsara} m This 
shows that charitable works for the use of the public or large 
sections of the publio came to be regarded as more meritorious 
than sacrifices the gifts in which benefited only brahmanas. 

From very ancient times the procedure of dedicating a well 
or tank to the public has been settled. Among the earliest is 
the one in the Sankhyayana gr. V. 2 (S. B. E. vol. 29 pp.134-135) 
whioh is as follows: Now about the censecration of ponds, wells 
and tanks. In the bright fortnight or on an auspicious tithi 
(day) having cooked a caru (boiled food) of barley in milk he 
(the donor) should saorifioe with the two verses 'tvam no 
agne* ( Rg. IV. 1. 4-5 ) and with the verses ' ava te hela ' ( Rg. I. 
24. 14), ' imam me varuna ' (Rg. 1. 25. 19), ' uduttamam Varuna * 
(Rg.1.24. 15), 'imam dhiyam' (Rg. VIII. 42.3) and with 
the words ' the domestic one, he who goes away from the house, 
the refreshing one, he who goes into the kennel, he who dwells 
in the kennel, he who comes out of it, the greedy one, the 
destroyer of enemies ' to the different directions beginning with 
the west ( VarunI, one over which Varuna presided ) from left 
to right. In the centre he makes oblations with milk with the 
verses 'visvatas caksuruta' ( Rg. X. 81. 3), 'idam Vision* 
( B,g. L 22. 17 ); he plunges into the water with the verse * yat 
kirn cedam Varuna * ( $g. VII. 89. 5 ). *°" A cow and a pair of

2071. Even in the e. g. ?g. in VII. 49. 3 (ylsffm rSjS varuijo ySti 
madhye ) Varuna is the lord of waters and therefore it ia appropriate 
that in dedioating wells and tanks to the public Varuna should be 
invoked in several verses.

clothes are the fee for this sacrifice. Then follows the feeding 
of brahman as. 

The Asv. gr. parisista IV. 9, Par. gr. parisista, Matsya- 
purana chap. 58, Agnipurana chap. 64 contain a more extensive 
prooedure about the dedication of wells and reservoirs of 
water. That in the Par. gr. parisista is briefly as mt follows : 
" In the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half, on 
an auspicious day, tithi, vara ( week day ), naksatra and karana 
the donor should cook cam saored to Varuna of barley, offer the 
two ajyabhagas and sacrifioe in fire ten oblations of clarified 
butter with the mantras, Rg. IV. 1. 4, IV. 1. 5, 1. 25. 19, 1. 24. 
11, Kat. sr. 25. 1. 11 ( ye te satarh Varuna ), ayasoagne ( Kat. 
sr. 25. 1. 11 ), Rg. I. 24. 15, Rg. I. 24. 8, Vaj. S. IV. 36, Vaj. S. 
VIII. 24. 8W He then sacrifices ( ten oblations ) of the mess of 
cooked food to Agni, Soma, Varuna, Yajna, Ugra, Bhlma, 
Satakratu ( Indra ), Vyustf ( prosperity ), Svarga ( Heaven ) and 
lastly to Agni Svistakrt ( with svaha at the end of each as in 
' agnaye svaha ' ). After partaking of the remains of the cooked 
food he should introduce aquatic animals ( like fishes and 
tortoises in the pond &c. ) and having bathed and decked a oow 
he should make the oow enter the reservoir, repeat the Purusa- 
sukta ( Bg. X. 90. 1-16 ) and donate that cow to the acarya and 
should also make presents to him of two ear-rings, clothes and 
of another oow as fee and give a dinner to brahmanas." Apararka 
( p. 413-414 ), the Nirnayasindhu and others add from the 
Bahvrca gr. parisis^a that when the oow enters the water, he 
Bhould repeat a mantra ' may you make this water holy : may 
the water alwayB be pure, holy and ambrosia-like ; while saving 
me ( from sin ) may you bathe in sacred water ; she crosses from 
region to region and also saves ( me and others ) '; and that the 
donor holds the end of the cow's tail, enters the water and brings 
her out in the north-east corner (of the reservoir). This prooedure

does not apply to the consecration of a well. In that oaae a 
cow is only made to go round the well. 

Gradually the prooedure prescribed in the puranas oame to 
have the upper hand so muoh so that AparSrka (p. 15 ) says 
that in pratistha the prooedure prescribed in the puranas has to 
be followed and no other. 207 * 

Apar&rka(pp. 409-414), Hemadri (Dana pp. 997-1029), 
DanakriySkaumudI ( pp. 160-181 ), Jalasayotsarga-tattva of 
Raghunandana, the Pratisthamayukha and Utsargamayukba of 
Nllakan^ha, Rajadharmakaustubha ( pp. 171-223 ) and several 
other works give a very comprehensive procedure of the con- 
secration of wells, ponds and tanks, based upon the grhya- 
parisistas, the puranas such as the Matsya chap. 58, the Tantras, 
PancarStra and other works. This.procedure is passed over here. 
The idea 8075 was that unless the reservoir was consecrated in the 
way prescribed its water was not holy and when consecrated it 
became holy. Pratistha generally means dedicating to the 
public with prescribed 8078 rites. Utsarga means * divesting one- 
self of ownership over a thing and dedicating it for the use of 
all.' There were four principal stages in the prooedure of 
pratistha; first the sankalpa, 8077 then the homa, then the utsarga 
( i. e. declaration that the thing has been dedicated ) and lastly 
the daksina and feeding of brahmanas. In Deosaran Bharthi v. 
Deoki Bharthi 3 Patna 842 it was said ( at p. 850 ) ' the essential 
ingredient that constitutes a gift whether of movable or of 
immovable property in the Hindu Law is the Sanknlpa and the 
Samarpava whereby the property is completely given away and 
the owner completely divests himself of the ownership in the

property '. In the case of temples, the proper word to use is 
pratisthft and not utsarga. 

There is a difference in the technioal meaning of dona and 
utsarga. In the former the donor gives up his ownership over 
a thing, makes another the owner of it and cannot thereafter 
use it nor has he any control over it. When a man makes an 
utsarga, he no doubt gives up his ownership, but be gives up the 
thing for the benefit of all ( as in the formula above be uses the 
word ' sarvabhutebhyah ' ) and so the opinion of most writers is 
that he oan as a member of the public make use of the thing 
dedicated by him, though there were a few authors who recom- 
mended that he should not do so. 2077a 

Reservoirs of water that are dug out by man are of four 
kinds, kupa, vapl, puskarinl and tadaga. 1078 Some of the works 
define kupa as a well that is from five to fifty cubits in length 
( if rectangular ) or in diameter ( if it is circular ). It has 
generally no flight of steps to reaoh the water. Vapl is a 
well with a flight of steps on all sides or on three or two aides 
or one side only and its mouth may be from 50 to 100 cubits ; a 
puskarinl is from 100 to 200 cubits in length or diameter and a 
tad&ga ( a tank ) is from 200 to 800 cubits. The Matsy apurana 
154. 512 states that a vapl is equal to ten kupas ( in merit ) and 
a hrada ( deep reservoir ) is equal to ten vapls ; a son is equal 
to ten hradas and a tree is equal to ten sons. Aooording 
to the Vasistba-samhita quoted by Baghunandana a puskarinl 
is up to 400 cubits and a tadaga is five times as much. At 
certain auspicious times only the conseoration of wells and 
tanks is to take place. 8079 

Trees have been highly prized in India at all times. They 
were useful in sacrifices for making the yupa ( the post to

which the sacrificial animal was tied ), for idhma ( samidhs 
which were thrown into fire ), for the several ladles like aruva, 
juhu etc. The Tai. Br. 1. 1. 3 speaks of seven holy trees. The 
Tai. S. III. 4. 8. 4 states that idhma ( samidhs ) should he of 
the nyagrodha, udumbara, asvattha and plaksa trees, as they 
are the abodes of Gandharvas and Apsarases. 8060 Besides trees 
with their verdant foliage looked beautiful and the leaves of 
some of them ( such as the mango tree ) are hung up even now 
in pandals and at entrances of houses as auspicious in marriage 
and other ceremonies. Hemadri cites a passage from the 
BrahmapurSna that the twigs and leaves of the Asvattha 
( the pipal tree ), udumbara, plaksa, cuta ( mango ) and nya- 
grodha are styled pancabhanga MB1 and are auspicious in all 
rites. The palasa tree was held to be so sacred that one was not 
to make seats, sandals or tooth brush from it or its branches 
and twigs ( Baud. Dh. S. II. 3. 25 ). Trees gave shelter against 
heat and also yielded flowers and fruits ( for worship of gods 
andpitrs). When felled their wood was useful in building 
houses, for making implements of husbandry and for producing 
heat and warmth. In his 7th Pillar Edict (of Delhi-Topra) 
Asoka mentions the oonstruotion of wells at a distance of 8 
krosas and the planting of banyan trees and mango groves 
( 0. 1. 1, vol. I pp. 134-135 ). The Mahabhasya ( vol. I. p. 14 ) 
quotes a portion of an ancient verse which conveys that if a 
person waters and tends mango trees, his pitrs feel extremely 
pleased. 80 " Manu IV. 39 and Yaj. 1. 133 require the snStaka to 
circumambulate well-known trees (like asvattha) if he meets 
them on the way. The Kadambarl also refers to this practice 
of worshipping trees, particularly by women desiring to have 
a son. 8083 The Mahabharata ( Anusasanaparva 58. 23-32) 
highly eulogizes plant life and divides plants into six kinds 
viz. vrksa ( tree ), lata ( creepers that cling to trees ), valll 
( creepers that spread on the ground ), gulma (bushes ), tvaksara

( trees whose bark is strong, while the inside is hollow, like 
bamboos ) and grass and adds that he who plants trees is saved 
( in a future existence ) by them just as sons do and that they 
should be tended like sons. 10 " The Visnu Dh.S.91.4 says the same 
thing. Hemadri (Dana pp. 1030-31) oites a long passage from 
the Padmapurana how by planting different trees and plants 
like asvattha, asoka, tamarind, pomegranate and others a man 
secures such rewards ( respectively ) as wealth, removal of 
sorrow, long life, a wife, &c. Vrddha-Gautaraa ( Jiv., part 2. 
p. 625) identifies the Asvattha tree with Sri Ersna. The 
Mahabharata ( Santi 69. 42) forbids even the felling of the 
leaves of trees like the asvattha that have a platform m * built 
for them ( caifcya ). Santiparva 184. 1-17 graphically describes 
how trees have life since they feel pain and pleasure and grow 
though cut. The Bhavisyapurana quoted in the Utsarga- 
mayukha ( p. 16 ) states ' he who plants either one asvattha or 
one picumarda or one nyagrodha or ten tamarind trees, or the 
three trees i. e. kapittha, bilva and amalaka or plants five 
mango trees would not see hell ( i. e. would not be condemned 
to hell for his sins ). 8086 The Matsyapurana ( chap. 270. 28-29 ) 
requires that to the east of the mcwfapa of a temple fruit-bear- 
ing trees should be planted, to the south trees that contain 
milky Bap, to the west a reservoir of water with lotuses therein 
should be constructed and to the noith a flower garden and 
sarala and tala trees. Vas. Dh.S. 19. 11-12 prescribes that no one 
should injure (i. e. cut) trees that yield fruits and flowers except 
only for purposes of cultivating the land ,087 ( and for sacrificial 
purposes, as laid down in Visnu Dh. S. 51. 63 ). The Visnu 
Dh. S. V. 55. 59 prescribes that the king should award the 
highest fine, the middling fine, or a fine of 100 karsapanas or of 
one karsapana respectively against those who wrongfully out 
a tree bearing fruit or a tree that bears flowers, or who out 
creepers and shrubs or grass. 

Hemadri ( Dana. pp. 1029-1055 ) deals at length with the 
planting of trees, the dedication of a garden and the merit

acquired by making gifts of various trees. The procedure of 
dedicating a garden is prescribed in San. gr. V. 3. Asv. gr. 
parisis^a IV. 10, the Matsyapurana 59, Agnipurana 70 and in 
many other works. It is modelled on the dedication of wells 
and tanks. The Matsyapurana expressly states that the 
procedure of the consecration of a tank is extended to the con- 
secration of everything, such as a prUsUda ( a large house or 
hall for public use), a garden &c, the only difference being that 
the mantras are different. 8089 The procedure in San. gr.*°" 
(V. 3) is: Having established the sacred fire in that garden 
and having cooked a mess of food, the donor should sacrifice 
with the words ( Visnave svaha, Indragnibhyam svaha, Visva- 
karmane svaha ) and with verses $g. III. 8. 6 ff. ( yan vo naro ), 
verse by verse. Then he reoites over the garden the verse Rg. 
III. 8. 11 ' vanaspate satavalso vi roha.' The fee for the sacri- 
fice is gold. 

Devata-pratistha — ( Conseoration of an image in a temple ). 

Though the dharmasutras speak as shown above of images 
and temples, it strikes one as somewhat strange that none of 
the prinoipal grhya and dharma-sutras contains any procedure 
of oonseorating an image in a temple, while in the puranas and 
some of the digests muoh space is devoted to the topic of devata- 
pratistha. The Matsyapurana in chap. 264 and the Agnipurana 
in chap. 60 and 66 deal with devatapratistha in general. There 
are special chapters in the puranas on the consecration of the 
image of Visnu or of Siva or the Linga. It would be impossible 
to deal in any detail with all this matter. The worship of god 
can be done in two ways, viz. without any outward symbol 
and with a symbol. The first is achieved by a prayer and 
offering oblations into fire ; the second by means of images. 
But even image worshippers are quite conscious that god is 
pure consciousness ( cit ), is one without a second, is without 
parts and without a physical body, and that the various images

in which he is thought as in-dwelling are so imagined for the 
benefit of worshippers.* * 

The worship of god through the medium of images is 
again two-fold, viz. done in one's house and in a public temple. 
The latter is, according to many works, the best and the 
oompletest, since it allows of the celebration of festivals and 
the performance of the varied items or modes of worship 
( upacara ). Private worship of idols in one's house has already 
been dealt with above ( pp. 726-736 ) under Devapuja. Now the 
worship of images in temples remains to be dealt with. The esta- 
blishment of images in temples is again of two kinds viz. calarca 
( where the image can be lifted up, moved to another place ) and 
sthirarca ( where the image is fixed on a pedestal or is not meant 
to be lifted up or moved ). The consecration of these two differs 
in certain details. 

Here numerous matters have to be considered. The principal 
matters to be attended to according to the Matsyapurana 
(264-66) are : the auspicious time for the consecration of an image, 
the erection of a mandapa to the east or north of the temple, 
the ereotion of a vedi therein, erection of four toranas ( arched 
gates ) for the mandapa, placing two auspicious jars at each of 
four gates filled with scented water and herbs and covered with 
mango leaves and white cloth, raising of banners all round the 
manfapa, worship of lokapalas ( guardian deities of quarters ), 
erecting another mandapa for bathing the image in, bringing the 
image and honouring the artizans, drawing lines on the image 
or linga with a golden needle to represent the lustre of eyes, the 
selection of a qualified sthapaka or acarya and of from eight 
to 32 other priests ( called murtipa ) ; taking the image or linga 
to the manfapa meant for bathing the image, bathing the image 
to the accompaniment of music with paficagavya mixture, with 
mrttika ( loose earth ), with holy ashes and water ; rendering it 
pure by repeating four mantras ( viz. samudrajyesthah, apo 
divyah, yasam raja and apo hi s^ba, which are respectively Rg. 
VII. 49. 1-3 and X. 9. 1 ); offering worship after the bath to 
the image with sandalwood paste and covering it with a 
garment ( with the verse ' abhi vastra ' Jig. IX. 97. 50 ), placing 
the image in a standing position with the mantra ' uttistha ' 
( Rg. I. 40. 1 ) ; placing the image in a chariot with the verses

and entering it in the mandapa with the verse 'ft krsnena' ( Rg. 
L 35. 2 ) ; placing the image on a bed on which kusa grass 
and flowers are strewn with the face { of the image ) towards 
the east ; plaoing a water jar ( called nidrakalasa ) having gold 
in it and a piece of cloth at the mouth towards the head of the 
image with the mantras ' apo devlr ' ( Tai. 8. VII. 3. 13. 1 ) and 
' apo asmftn ' ( Rg. X 17. 10 ) ; plaoing under the head of the 
image silken pillows, sprinkling honey and clarified butter, 
and worshipping with mustard with the verse ' fipyayasva ' 
( Rg. I. 91. 16 or IX. 31. 4 ) and ' ya te rudra ' ( Tai. S. IV. 5. 1. 
1 ) ; offering worship with sandalwood paste and flowers and 
tying a band ( pratisara ) on the right hand ( of the image ) with 
' barhaspatya ' mantra ; placing a parasol, chowrie, mirror, 
jewels, auspicious herbs, household utensils, fine vessels and 
seats by the side of the image with the verse ' abhi tva ' (Rg. 
VII. 32. 22 ) ; honouring the image with the presentation of 
various foods and condiments with the verse ' tryambakam 
yajamahe ' ( Rg. VII. 59. 12 ) ; placing four priests and four 
door-keepers in the four directions viz. a priest knowing Rgveda 
in the east and so on and each of the four priests is to repeat 
from his own Veda several hymns and verses e. g. the Rgvedin 
priest should recite Srlsukta (Rg. 1. 165), Pavamana hymn (from 
Rg. IX. 1 ), Santikadhyaya ( Rg. X. 16 ), then a hymn to Indra. 
Then the ftcarya is to perform homa towards the head of the 
image with Santika mantras and offer into the fire 1000 samidha 
( fuel sticks ) each of palSsa, udumbara, asvattha, apamarga and 
saml trees and then touoh the feet of the god ; preparing nine 
kundag each one oubit square and offering into them one 
thousand satnidhs each time on touching the navel, the chest 
and the head of the image ; remembering the eight forms 
(mflrti) of god viz. the earth, fire, the sacrifice, the sun, 
the water, wind, moon and akaia and offering homa to 
these with vaidika mantras ; plaoing auspicious jars near eaoh 
kunda; bathing the image at every watch and offering 
incense, food ( naivedya ), sandalwood paste ; offering ball to 
all beings, and dinner to brahmanas and persons of other 
castes at one's desire ; celebrating a festival at night with 
dances, song and music; this may go on from one day to 
seven days (it is called adhivasana); then the temple building 
is to be sprinkled over; finding out a place for the image either 
to the north or slightly to the north-east in the temple ; a stone 
in the form of a tortoise is to be placed on the temple floor ;

preparing a pindiks and bathing it with paficagavya with 
mantras; then raising the image with the mantra 'uttistfia' 
( Rg. I. 40. 1 ), bringing it in the inmost chamber of the temple 
and placing it on the ptyha (pedestal), offering it arghya water, 
padya water, madhuparka; then the nyasa (depositing) of eight 
kinds of jewels viz. diamond, pearl, lapis luzuli, oonoh, crystal, 
pusparaga, indranlla and nlla in the eight directions from the 
east, also of eight kinds of grains viz. wheat, barley, sesamei 
mudga, nlvara, syamaka, mustard and rioe and also eight 
fragrant things such as white and red sandal-wood, agaru, 
uslra &o. Nyasa of all these is to be made after repeating om 
and the pauraajika mantras ( with ' namo namah ' at end ) of the 
eight guardians (lokapalas) viz. Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, 
Varuna, Vayu, Soma, Isana and also of Brahma ( 9th ) and 
Ananta (10th); raising the image and fixing it in the scooped 
up portion of the pedestal with the mantra ' dhruvfi dyaur ' 
(Rg. X. 173. 4); plaoing one's hand on the head of the image 
and contemplating on the well-known form of the deity that is 
established, whether Visnu, Siva, Brahma, the Sun; repeating 
appropriate mantras (viz. those of Rudra, Visnu, Brahma, the 
Sun in the case of the respective gods whose image is establi- 
shed); establishing deities near the prinoipal image of the 
god's dependants (such as Nandl in the case of Siva); invoca- 
tion ( avahana ) of the prinoipal deity with its attendants with 
pauraijiha mantras ; bathing the image with curds, milk, clarified 
butter.honey and sugar and then with water in which flowers and 
scents are mixed up; repeating the following mantras again and 
again viz. 'yaj-j&grato duram-upaiti ' ( Vftj. S. 34. 1), 'tato virad- 
ajayata' (Vaj. S. 31. 5 ), ' sahasraslrsa ' (Rg. X. 90. 1), ' yenedam 
bhutam ' ( V&j. S. 34. 4 ), * na tv&vSm ' ( Rg. VII. 32. 23 ) ; touch- 
ing four times with water the feet, the waist and head ( of the 
image); giving gifts of olothes, ornaments &o. to the aoarya 
and to the poor, the blind and the distressed and to others 
that may be gathered to see; filling with sand any aperture in 
any direction in which the image appears to be unstable and 
performing propitiatory rites for the guardian of that quarter 
and making gifts suitable to each lokap&la; oelebrating a 
festival for three, five or seven days. 

The general procedure of consecrating an image has been 
given above at some length from the MatsyapurSna in order to 
convey some idea how in the first centuries of the Christian 
era the consecration of images was done. It will be noticed 



$66 History of DharmaiMra fOh.iXVl 

that mostly vedio mantras were employed though a few pau- 
ratjika mantras also ooour. In medieval digests like the Deva- 
prafcisthatattva other elements were added from Tantra works. 
Speoial attention may be drawn to the faot that in the above 
procedure the word pranapratistha does not ooour in the Matsya. 
Baghunandana ( in Devapratisthfitattva ) quotes Devlpurana to 
the effeot that pranapratistha is done after touching the oheeks 
of the image with the right band and that without this vivifica- 
tion a mere image does not attain to the position of a deity 
worthy of worship. In the Devapratistfiatattva, the Nirnaya- 
sindhu, the Rajadharma-kaustubha and other works the prana- 
pratistha is based on the 23rd chapter ( patala ) of the Sarada- 
tilaka ( verses 72-76 ). The mantra is given below. "•' 

The DevapratisthStattva ( p. 505 ) quotes the Hayaslrsapan- 
oaratra to the effect that generally a brahmana should officiate 
at the consecration of an image of Visnu, but a ksatriya can 
officiate for a vaisya or a sudra yajamana and a vaisya may do 
for a sudra yajamana, but a sudra cannot officiate. 

In the Matsyapurana, the Agnipurana, the NrsimhapurSna, 
the Nirnayasindhu and many other works there are descriptions 
of the oonsecration of the images of Vasudeva, of a linga and 
other deities, which are all passed over here for want of space. 
In these works following Tantrio praotioes three kinds of nyasas 
viz. Matrkanyasa, Tattvanyasa and Mantranyasa are referred to. 
The Matrkanyasa consists in repeating the letters of the alphabet 
from a ( inoluding ' am * and ' ah ' ) to 1 ( in the form of akaraya

namah svaha ) and offering an oblation in fire. The Tattva- 
nyasa consists in repeating ' Atmatattv&ya namah, svaha ' and 
the same formula as to Atmattvadhipati, Kriyasakti, Sivatattva 
(or Visnutattva ), Sivatattvadhipati, Icchasakti, Vidyatattva, 
Vidyatattvadhipati, Adharasakti. The Mantranyasa is aa 
follows : taking a mantra of oertain letters for a god ( e. g. one 
of 12 letters as in ' om namo bhagavate Vasudevaya ' ) one has to 
repeat each letter in the formula ' om omkaraya namah svaha '. 

The Dharmasindhu III ( purvardha ) sets forth a brief 
procedure of the consecration of images in which only one 
priest is required ( vide pp. 333-34 ). In modern times also the 
procedure of dovatapratistha contains numerous elements and 
is extremely long. 

The Vaikhanasa Smartasutra ( IV. 10-11 ) contains perhaps 
the earliest extant detailed description of the consecration of the 
image of Visnu. But it appears to have been mainly concerned 
with an image installed in private houses or with the worship 
of an image by one individual. It is briefly as follows : 10>t 
After the daily homa comes the daily worship of Visnu, which 
( worship ) comprehends in itself the worship of all gods. A 
brahmana passage ( Ait. Br. I. 1 ) says ' Agni is indeed the 
nethermost ( or the lowest ) among gods and Visnu the highest; 
between these two stand all the other deities '. Therefore hav- 
ing established in one's house the highest god Visnu the house- 
holder worships him at the end of the evening and morning 
homa. He should make an image of Visnu in length not more 
than six fingers; he should perform its consecration in the 
bright half ( of a month ) on an auspioious naksatra. Three 
days before he should prepare the space ( kunda ) of the grhya 
fire and perform the several rites of proksana, drawing lines as 
desoribed ( in Vaik. I. 9 ). Then he is to perform homa up to 
agharas ( as described above pp. 210-11 ). Then he performs the 
sacrifices to the limbs in the words * to the teeth, svaha : to 
the jaws, svahl ', and other oblations with the six mantras 
beginning with * ato deva ' (Rg. 1. 22. 16-21 ). Then he performs 
while repeating audibly the hymn to Purusa ( Rg. X. 90. 1-16 ) 
the opening of the eyes ( of the god Visnu ) with a golden 
needle. Having spread in a river or a pond or in a vessel filled 
with water cloth and kusa grass with the mantras beginning 
' ye te satam ' ( mentioned in Vaik. III. 17 ) he lays down ( the

image of ) the god on these with the head turned to the east and 
leaves the image there. On the second day after he bathes, he 
offers at night the ftgh&ra in the usual way ; he brings eight 
jars, fills them successively with paQcagavya, ghee, ourds, 
milk, water mixed with whole rice, water with fruits, water 
with kusa grass, water with jewels (pearls &o. ); worships 
the god, bathes the image with the ( contents of ) the ( eight ) 
jars successively with the following mantras : ' vasoh pavitram* 
(Vaj. S. I. 31 ), ' agna fiyahi', * ise tvorje tva,' ' sam no devlr,' MM 
'catvfiri srhga* (Rg. IV. 58. 3 ), 'somo dhenum* (Rg. I. 91. 26 ), 
'catvSri vak' ( Rg. 1. 164. 45 ), 'idam visnur ' ( Rg. 1. 22. 17 ) ; 
he further bathes the image with perfumed waters to the 
accompaniment of the mantras ' apo ' ( Rg. X 9. 1 ), ' hiranya- 
varn&h ' ( Tai. S. V. 6. 1. 1 ) and the pavamana section. He then 
makes to the north of the fire a vedi ( altar ) with rice, plaoes a 
seat on it, spreads cloth on it, places the god thereon and 
having deoked ( the image ) with clothes &o. worships the 
image. He has the benediction pronounced ( by the brahmanas ), 
he touches the pratisara ( a band or ribbon ) with the svasti 
hymn* 09 * and ties it ( on the right hand of the image ) with the 
mantra ' svastida visaspatir ' ( Rg. X 152. 2 ). He then lays 
the god down as before. After filling with purified clear water 
a jar that is not dark-coloured, he places it by the ( right ) side 
of the image, touches it with the syllable ' om ' and throws into 
it a bunch of kusa grass, whole rice, a piece of gold and a jewel 
(pearl ). Having meditated on the god who is really without 
parts as residing in his own heart and also in the clear water, 
as golden in splendour, as having red face, eyes, hands and 
feet, as wearing the irlvatsa mark and a yellow garment, as 
having ( in his hands ) the conoh and the disc, as of benign 
oountenanoe and as possessed of all parts ( i. e. oomplete ) he 
should bow before him. Having sprinkled water round the fire 
and having lauded the work of the hotr, he invokes the god by 
name in the southern pranidhi vessel in the words ' om bhuh 
purusam ' ( avahayami ) and performs invocations in the same 
way with vy&hrtis separately and together and of Narayana,

Visnu, Purusa, Satya, Aoyuta, Aniruddha, 6ri, Mahl. Having 
poured out the rice (for the sacrificial offering ) he sacrifices 
four times with ghee and with a hymn to Visnu, with the 
Purusasukta ( Rg. X. 90 ), with the mantras beginning with 
* ato devah ' ( Rg. I. 22. 16-21 ) and with the mantra ' medinl 
devl' ; he should then offer the mess of boiled rice sprinkled over 
with clarified butter after invoking the god's names (Kesava and 
11 others mentioned in Vaik. III. 13). On the following morning 
he bathes, placing the god in the standing position after uttering 
'om'; carries the image with the jar while muttering the 
sakuna hymn ( Rg. II. 42. 1-3 and II. 43. 1-3 ) in the north- 
western direction into his house or in a temple or in the 
agnihotra-shed ; placing down on the pedestal meant for the 
image jewels and gold he instals the image of Visnu saying ' I 
install Visnu ' while repeating a hymn to Visnu and the hymn 
to Purusa ( Rg. X. 90 ). He makes a nyUsa on the head, on the 
navel, on the feet and the chest of the image of the syllables 
svah, bhuvah and bhuh and om ; fixing his mind on the god 
with the mantra ' idam Visnur * ( Rg. L 22. 17 ) and taking with 
a bunch of kusa grass the clear water that has been already 
poured in the jar and that has already the iakti ( power personi- 
fied ) in it, he makes ( the water ) flow on the head of the image 
and performs the invocation with the words ' I invoke Visnu \ 
Having propitiated by worship as laid down in the sastric rules 
he presents the sacrificial food ( to the image ). 

In Vaik. IV. 12 the daily worship of Visnu is set out. 

The practice of attaching dancing girls to temples is of 
respectable antiquity. The origin of this practice appears to be 
analogous to the institution of Vestal virgins in Rome. The 
Rajatarangipl ( IV. 269 ) speaks of two dancing girls attached 
to a temple ( devagrhasrifce nartakyau ) who danced and sang 
at a place as it was the custom of their family, though the 
temple itself was buried underground. In the Vaghli (Ehandesh 
District) stone Inscription dated sake 991 (1069-70 A. D.) 
there is a grant of Govindaraja making provision for dancing 
and singing by damsels' 08 * ( vilasinl ). In the Inscription of the 
CahamSna king Jojaladeva dated saihvat 1147 ( 1090-91 A. D. ) 
the courtezans of all temples are said to have been ordered to 
oome in their best dress and celebrate a festival with music 
( E. I. vol. XI. 26 and 27 ) and the king records an imprecation

against all who might stop that praotioe. The Ittagi ( 20 miles 
east of Gadag) inscription dated 1112 A. D. records ( E. I. 
vol. XIII. p. 58 ) that a brahmana named Mahadeva donated 
houses for the retinue of dancing girls and other attendants of 
the gods at Iftagi. This praotioe of devadasis ( minor girls 
dedicated to the service of temples ) or. bhUvins ( whioh term is 
known in the southern parts of the Ratnagiri district ) was held 
by the modern Indian Courts to be immoral and whoever disposes 
of any person under the age of 18 years ( or obtains possession 
of any person ) with intent that such person shall at any age 
be employed or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit 
intercourse with any person or with knowledge that the person 
is likely to be employed or used for any suoh purpose at any 
age is liable to be prosecuted under Sec 372 and 373 of the 
Indian Penal Code ( as amended by Act 18 of 1924 ). mt In 
Bombay there is the Bombay Devadasis Protection Act 
( Bombay Act X of 1934 ) which declares the performance of 
ceremonies for dedicating an unmarried woman to an idol or 
temple illegal and renders the dedicator or abettor thereof 
liable to punishment ( one year's imprisonment or fine or both ). 

Punah-pratistha : — ( Re-conseoration of images in temples ). 
The BrahmapurSna quoted by the Devapratis^hatattva and the 
Nirnayasindhu says ' when an image is broken into two or is 
reduced to particles, is burnt, is removed from its pedestal, is 
insulted, has censed to be worshipped, is touched by beasts like 
donkeys or falls on impure ground or is worshipped with mantras 
of other deities or is rendered impure by the touch of outcasts 
and the like — in these ten contingencies, god oeases to indwell 
therein.' When an image is polluted by ( contact with ) the 
blood of a brahmana or by the touch of a corpse or the touch of 
a patita it should be re-oonsecrated. If an Image is broken in 
parts or reduced to particles it should be removed according to 
iSstric rules and another should be installed in its place. When

an image is broken or stolen a fast should be observed. If 
images of metal suoh as of copper are touched by thieves or 
candalas they should be purified in the same way in whioh 
polluted vessels of those metals are purified and then they should 
be re-consecrated. If an image properly consecrated has had no 
worship performed without pre-meditation (i.e. owing toforgetful- 
ness or neglect ) for one night or a month or two months or the 
image is touched by a sudra or a woman in her monthly illness, 
then the image should have water adhivasa ( placing in water ) 
performed on it and it should be bathed with water from a 
jar, then with paflcagavya, then it should be bathed with pure 
water from jars to the accompaniment of the hymn to Purusa 
( Bg. X. 90 ) repeated 8000 times, 800 times or 28 times, worship 
should be offered with sandal-wood paste and flowers, naivedya 
(food) of rice cooked with jaggery should be offered. This is the 
way in whioh the re-consecration is effected. 

Jiryoddhara ( rehabilitating old or dilapidated temples &c). 
This subject is closely connected with the preceding topic and is 
dealt with in the Agnipurana, chap. 67 and 103 ( about lingas); 
the Nirnayasindhu ( III. purvardha p. 353 ), the Dharmasindhu 
( III. purvardha p. 335 ) give an extensive procedure following 
the Agnipurana. This is done when the image in a temple or a 
linga is burnt, or reduoed to particles or is removed to another 
plaoe. The Agnipurana ( 103. 4 ) says that if an image or 
linga is carried off by the strong current of a river, it may be 
re-consecrated elsewhere aocording to the rites prescribed in the 
sastra. According to the Agnipurana 8087 ( 103. 21 ) a linga that 
is reputed to have been established by the asuras ( like Banfi- 
sura ) or famous sages or by gods or by those who were expert 
in Tantra should not be removed to another place, whether it be 
worn oat or broken, even after the performance of prescribed 
rites. The Agnipurana prescribes (chap. 67. 3-6) that an image 
of wood when extremely worn out may be burnt, one of stone 
may be thrown into water, one made of metal or of a jewel 
( pearl &c. ) should be thrown into very deep water or the sea 
after carrying it covered with cloth in a cart to the accompani- 
ment of musio and on the same day another of the same dimen- 
sions and substanoe should be installed after the purification of 
the image is effected. When the daily worship of an image

had been stopped of set purpose or when it is touched by sudras 
and the like, purification can be effected only by re-consecra- 
tion. Ee-oonsecration oan be done even in intercalary months 
or when Venus is too near the sun to be visible. When a temple 
or a well or a tank is breached or when a garden embankment 
or a publio hall is injured, one should offer four oblations of 
clarified butter with the four verses ' idam Visnur ' ( Eg. I. 
22.17 ), *ma nastoke* (Eg. 1. 114. 8), * Visnoh karmani' ( Eg. I. 
22. 19 ), ' padosya ' ( Eg. X 90. 3), and then a dinner may be 
given to brahmanas. 

The procedure of jirytoddhara is given at length in the 
Nirnayasindhu, the Dharmasindhu and other works. Vrddba- 
H&rlta IX 409-415 also deals with re-consecration. Sankha- 
Likhita quoted in the VivSda-ratnSkara and other works say that> 
when an image, a garden, a well, a bridge (over a moat or river), 
a flagstaff, a dam, a reservoir of water are breached, they should 
be repaired ( or raised ), re-consecrated and the person guilty of 
breach should be fined 800 panas. 8088 When worship was 
stopped, some authors prescribed re-consecration, while others 
prescribed only proksana as laid down in the Devapratistha- 
tattva ( p. 512 ) or Dharmasindhu ( III purvardha p. 334 ). 

The Kiradu ( Jodhpur ) Inscription of the time of king 
Bhlmadeva of Anahillapataka records that in plaoe of an image 
broken by Turuskas ( Moslems ) a new one was installed in 
aaihvat 1235 ( 1178-79 A. D. ) by the wife of Tejahpala, a sub- 
ordinate officer of tbe feudatory Cahamana Maharajaputra 
Madanabrahma ( vide E. I. vol. XX, Appendix p. 56 No. 381 ). 

Mathapratistha : — ( the founding of a monastery or a college 
for teachers and pupils. ) 

The founding of mathas appears to have been not very 
anoient. The Baud. Dh. S. ( III. 1. 16 ) in speaking of a 
householder who is an agnihotrin remarks ' after departing from 
his house he (the householder) stops at the extremity of the 
village, builds there a hut (ku{l), or a cottage hall (matha) 
and enters it'. Here matha does not appear to have any 
technical sense. In the lexicon of Amara a matha is defined 
as ' a plaoe where pupils ( and their teacher ) reside '. A temple

and a matha were both established from the same religious 
motive or sentiment, but they served different purposes. A 
temple was built principally for the purpose of prayer and 
worship. It also often provided for religious instruction, for 
the recitation of the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the 
puranas, for kirtans to the accompaniment of music. But these 
latter were only secondary purposes. In the case of the mathas 
they were primarily intended for the instruction of pupils or 
the laity by some great teacher in the tenets of a sect or in 
the doctrines of some philosophy or in some branch of learning 
such as grammar, mlmarhsa, astronomy and the like. In many 
cases shrines or temples are associated with or affiliated to the 
mathas, but the worship of a particular deity is not the primary 
object of mathas. Mathas among the followers of the Vedio 
religion probably owed their origin to the example of Buddhist 
monasteries ( vih&ras ) ,0 ". The foundation of mathas received 
a great fillip after the times of the oelebrated Advaita teacher, 
the great Sankaracarya, whom tradition credits with having 
established for the propagation of his system of Vedanta four 
mathas at Srngerl, Purl ( Qovardhanamatha ), Dvaraka ( Sarada- 
matha) and Badarl ( Jyotirmatha ). Vide E. C. vol. VI Sg. 
No. 11 ( an inscription dated 1652 A. D. ) where reference is 
made to a grant in Sriigapura, the dharmapltha established by 
Sankaracarya, to the famous matha at Srngerl for the worship 
of Mallikarjuna, Vidya-sankara-svamI and Saradamba. Other 
acaryas like Ramanuja and Madhva established their own 
mathas and the number of mathas is now legion. Originally a 
matha started by a sannyasin like the great Sankaracarya 
must have had no property, as ascetics were prohibited by the 
sastras from possessing property, except suoh articles of 
personal use as clothes, sandals, religious books on paim leaf 
or paper &c. Besides sannySsins were required not to stay 
long in one place. So people built shelters for them, in order 
to acoommodate them when they visited their town or village 
and these were probably originally called matha, which in 
its narrow sense means a place where an ascetio resides. 
In its wider sense it means an institution where a teacher 
presides and instructs several disciples in religious and ana- 
logous tenets, practices and dogmas. But gradually the zeal 
and devotion of the disciples and followers of the great

teachers endowed the mathas with considerable moveable 
and immoveable properties. The origin of mathas (spoken 
of as madams in South India ) has been lucidly set forth as 
follows in Sammantha Pandora v. Sellappa Chetti 2 Mad. 175 
at p. 179 ' a preoeptor of religious dootrine gathers around 
him a number of disciples whom he initiates into the parti* 
cular mysteries of the order and instructs in its religious 
tenets. Such of these disciples as intend to become religious 
teaohers renounce their connection with their family and 
all olaims to the family wealth and as it were affiliate 
themselves to the spiritual teacher whose sohool they have 
entered. Pious persons endow the schools with property which 
is vested in the preceptor for the time beiitg and a home for the 
school is created and a ma^am constituted. The property 
of the ma^tam does not descend to the disciples or elders in 
common; the preoeptor, the head of the institution, selects 
from among the affiliated disciples him whom he deems the 
most competent and in his own life-time instals the disciple so 
settled as his successor, not uncommonly with some ceremonies. 
After the death of the preceptor the disciple so chosen is ins- 
talled in the gaddi and takes by succession the property whioh 
has been held by his predecessor. The property is in fact 
attaohed to the office and passes by inheritance to no one who 
does not fill that office. It is in a certain sense trust property ; 
it is devoted to the maintenance of the establishment, but the 
superior has a large domain over it, and is not accountable 
for its management nor for the expenditure of the income, 
provided he does not apply it to any purpose other than 
what may fairly be regarded as in furtherance of the object 
of the institution. Aoting for the whole institution he may 
contract debts for purposes connected with his mattam and 
debts so contracted might be reoovered from the mattam 
property and would devolve as a liability on his successor to the 
extent of the assets received by him*. Vide also Oiyana Sambandha

Ch. XXVI 1 temples and Mathas $09" 

The head of a matha is called svSml, mathapati or matha- 
dhipati or mdhanta (usually written as mohunt in the Law 
Reports ). The head of the matha is usually appointed accord- 
ing to the custom and practice of each matha, generally in one 
of three ways, viz. (1) the head for the time seleots from among 
his disciples a fit one to sucoeed him, (2) the disciples elect one 
from among themselves to sucoeed on the demise of the head, 
(3) the ruling power or the original founder or his heirs appoint 
the head when there is a vaoanoy. 

That temples and mathas have throughout the oenturies 
been supplementary to each other, both ministering to the reli- 
gious and spiritual wants of the people can be shown by a few 
examples. It has been seen how Bana ( in the seventh century) 
refers to the recitation of the Mahabharata in the temple of 
Mahakala at Ujjayinl. The Rajataranginl ( V. 29 ) states how 
king Avantivarman of Kashmir appointed one Ramata Upa- 
dhy&ya to the post of expounder (vyakhyatrpadaka) of grammar 
in a temple ( about 900 A. D. ). The Agnipurfina 2101 enjoins that 
in a temple of Siva or Visnu or the Sun if any one reads a book 
he may thereby acquire ( the merit of ) the imparting of all 
knowledge. Some mathas on the other hand provided for 
instruction not only in spiritual knowledge but also in secular 
knowledge. In the Patna Inscription of the time of the YSdava 
king Singhana, we read that Cangadeva, the court astronomer 
and astrologer, established in sake 1128 ( 1207 A. D. ) a matha 
for the study of the Siddhsnta-siromani ( an astronomical 
work ) of Bhaskaracarya, the grandfather of Cangadeva ( E. I. 
vol. I. p. 338 ), the matha being endowed with lands and other 
sources of income by two feudatories of Singhana. Vide also 
E. 0. vol. VI. Sg. No. 11 referred to above ( p. 907 ) where in 
endowing the matha at Srngerl provision was made for the 
worship of Mallikarjuna and Saradamba. 

A passage quoted in the Danaoandrika from the Skanda- 
purftna states that a matha should be provided with cots and 
seats, should be tfa<*tohed with grass and provided with platforms 
and should be donated to brahmanas or asoetics at some auspi- 
cious time ; by so doing a man secures all his desires and if he 
has no worldly desires he seoures release ( from samscira ). im

910 History of Dharmaiastra { Oh. XXVI 

The word matba was sometimes used in the sense of a 
dharmasalS, a place provided for the temporary residence of 
travellers from distant parts. For example, the Rajatarahginl 
VI. 300 states that queen Didda oonstruoted ( about 972 A. D. ) 
a matha for the residence of the people from Madhyadesa, 
Lata and SaurSs^ra. 

Throughout India for many centuries there have been well- 
endowed temples and mathas. But how the rulers or the ancient 
and medieval courts of justice regulated the administration of 
these institutions or their funds or how they prevented or stop- 
ped maladministration or misappropriation is not dealt with 
exhaustively anywhere. 

In Oirijanund Datta Jha v. Sailajanund Daita Jha 23 Cal. 
645 it is observed as follows ( at p. 653 ) ' notwithstanding the 
existence of numerous richly endowed Hindu shrines all over 
India from the earliest times, the Hindu Law strictly so called 
is, as Sir T. Strange complains (see his Hindu Law, Ed. of 1839, 
vol.1, p. 32) meagre in its provisions relating to religious 
endowments, a fact which may perhaps be accounted for on the 
supposition that the high reputation for piety and purity of 
character justly enjoyed for the most part by the priestly classes 
of ancient India who had the management of the shrines was 
deemed a sufficient safeguard against breach of duty, so bb to 
render detailed rules of law to regulate their oonduot unneces- 
sary '. In the following some of the meagre material that can 
be gathered from Dharmasastra works and analogous writings 
is set out. Manu ( XI. 26 ) first appeals to the religious senti- 
ments of people by declaring that the wioked man who from 
greed seizes the property of gods or of brahraanas feeds in 
another world on the leavings of the food of vultures. Sahara 
remarks (on Jaimini 2102 IX. 1.9) that when it is said that a village 
or field belongs to a god, that is not a literal expression but 
used only in a seoondary sense. That is said to be owned by a 
person which one can use as one likes ; a field or a village can- 
not be used by a deity ; but the attendants on the god ( or 
temple ) are maintained out of what is donated to a temple or 
god. From this it follows that all those rules that apply to a gift 
to a human being do not apply to a property dedicated to an

idol. Medh&tithi 8, °* (onManu XI. 26 and II. 189) points 
out that images cannot be said to be owners in the 
literal sense, but only in a secondary or ideal sense, since 
the idol in a shrine cannot use the property at its will nor 
can it safeguard it and ownership consists in being able to 
use the thing owned as one desires and in being able to preserve 
it. In modern times courts in India have laid down that an 
idol is a juridical person capable of holding property, though 
from the vary nature of the oase the possession and management 
of the property rests with a manager or a trustee. A matha is 
in the same position as an idol. The rights of the idol or 
of the ma^ha can be safeguarded and vindicated in a court 
of law only by the manager or trustee of the temple 
or by the head ( called mohunt ) of the matha. 8 ' 05 Vide 
Bhupati Nath v. Ram Lai 37 Cal. 128 ( F. B. ) at pp. 145-153 
where Mr. Justice Mukerji examines at length passages of 
Sahara, Medhatithi, the Dayabhaga and its commentators to 
explain what is meant by a gift to an idol according to the 
notions of the Hindu writers. Manu and other smrtikaras 
lay down that it is part of the king's duty to prosecute and 
fine persons interfering with or destroying the property of 
temples. Yaj. II. 228 prescribes a fine of 40, 80 or 160 panas 
respectively for cutting off the twigs, principal branches of 
trees or the entire trees themselves that grow on built up 
platforms or in cemeteries or on boundaries or in holy places 
or near temples. Yaj. ( II. 240 and 295 ) prescribes the highest 
ammercement for fabricating a false edict or for tampering 
with royal edicts by inserting more or less than what is inten- 
ded to be granted by the king. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 186 says 
that the king should sedulously safeguard all rules made 
about the pastures for cows ( in a village ) or about the preser- 
vation of tanks and temples. Manu IX. 280 requires the king 
to pronounce the death sentence on those who break into a royal 
storehouse or an armoury or a temple and prescribes that the 
breaker of an image shall repair the whole damage and also pay 
a fine of five hundred panas. Kaut III. 9 prescribes punishment

912 Hittory of DharmaiMra [ Ch. XXVI 

for encroachment on temples. From the Kautfllya ,,M we 
know that kings appointed an officer called ' devatadhyakaa ' 
( Superintendent of temples ) and that when the king's treasury 
became empty it was part of the duty of that officer to bring 
together all the wealth of the temples in the forts and other 
parts of the country and the king could in an emergency use 
that wealth (and probably used to return it later when financial 
stringency ceased). Among matters called praklrnaka (mis- 
cellaneous ) of which the king was to take oognisanoe suo motu 
without anybody's complaint, Narada inoludes ( in verse 3 ) 
'abstraction of gifts* and 'gifts of villages and towns to 
brahraanas * (verse 2). According to the Sm. 0. among the topics 
called chalas* m were two viz. the destruction of a reservoir 
of drinking water and of a temple. Katy ayana states that mere 
wrongful possession for any length of time of women, of state 
property and of temple property would not confer ownership on 
anybody. These texts indioated that the Government of the 
day proteoted temple properties, tanks, wells and the like that 
were dedicated to the publio and exercised powers of superin- 
tendence and correction in matters affeoting them. Yaj. IL 
191 says that those who look after the business of guilds etc. 
in which many are interested should be students of the Veda, 
men of rectitude and free from greed. They are styled karya- 
cintaka by him. Brhaspati "° 8 quoted by Apararka says 
( p. 796 ) that these karyacintakas ( committee ) should consist of 
two, three or five persons and that if there be disagreement 
between the larger bodies and the committee the king should 
decide that dispute and should bring round to the proper path 
whoever might be in the wrong. It appears that from very 
ancient times ( 3rd or 2nd oentury B. 0. ) the committee in 
charge of religious foundations was called gos$hl and the

of s temple is called sthcLnapati (vide Srlrangam plates of Deva- 
r&ya II dated sake 1356 in E. I. vol. 18, p. 138). In the Sirpur 
Stone Inscription of MahSsivagupta ( about 8th or 9th century 
A. D. ) of Mahakosala provision is made for a portion of the 
property granted being heritable by the sons and grandsons 
of the donees only if they were worthy, kept up agnihotrai 
studied the six angas and had olean mouths and did not 
engage in service and further that if the heir did not possess 
these qualities or died without leaving a son &c, then 
another person, a relative with the requisite qualifications, 
oould be made the reoipient of that share, and he was to 
be elderly and learned and was to be chosen by mutual agree- 
ment and the king's express order was not to be necessary 
for his selection. " 10 Paithlnasi quoted by Apararka p. 746 
ordains that the king should not deprive temples and corpo- 
rations of their properties. A record from Malabar of the 
11th century A D. gives the details of temple administration 
in Kerala, that was in the hands of Yogam ( corporation ) 
wielding independent power (B. L vol. 18 p. 340). The 
Feshwa's Government at Poona often interfered when disputes 
arose about properties dedicated to shrines and tombs of saints 
between the managers of the temples or among the heirs of the 
saint to whom lands had been originally donated. For example, 
the Peshwa made an award in 1744 A. D. about the principal 
religious and charitable institution in the Decoan, viz. the 
Cninchvad Samsthan, whereby he set apart one half of all pro- 
perties bestowed on the shrine at that place for purely religious 
and oharitable purposes and distributed the other half between 
the manager and his kinsmen who were all descendants of the 
original founder, Shri Moraya Gosavi ( vide Chintaman v. Dhondo

Feshwa in 1777-78 A. D. about the Brahmanal Samsthan in the 
Satara Distriot ( vide Annaji v. Narayana 21 Bom. 536 ). This 
privilege of ancient rulers to redress grievances and correct 
abuses in the management of religious and charitable endow- 
ments devolved upon the British Government as laid down by 
the Privy Council in Rajah Muthu Ramlinga v. Perianayagum 
Pillai, L. R II. A. 209 at p. 232 'It is evident.. .that the British 
Qovernment, by virtue of its sovereign power, asserted as the 
former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit endow- 
ments of this kind and to prevent and redress abuses in their 
management '. The Indian Central and Provincial Legislatures 
have placed on the Statute book many Acts regulating religious 
and oharitable endowments. A list of the most important of 
these enactments is given below.* 111 

Property dedioated to a god is called ' devottara * ( the word 
being written as debutter in the Law Reports, particularly from 
Bengal). Vide Sham Charon Nandi v. Abhiram (?os«;amt,33Cal.511

the rights and liabilities of the trustees and the sevakas ( called 
Shebait in Bengal ), about their mismanagement of the temple 
properties and their removal and so forth. 

Among impartible things Manu ( IX. 219 ) included yoga- 
ksema. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 118-119 shows that several mean- 
ings were attached to that expression by various writers, but that

as tanks, gardens, and temples could not be partitioned by the 
sons and grandsons. In modern times also the same is the rule. 
Besides properties dedicated to temples and other religious and 
charitable purposes are generally inalienable, according to 
legislative enactments and judioial decisions, ,m except where 
an alienation is absolutely neoessary for the upkeep of the 
religious worship or for the benefit and preservation of the 
institution. 

A question arises whether, when a work of public utility is 
dedicated, the founder possesses any control over the thing 
dedicated and if so to what extent. The Vlramitrodaya ( on 
Vyavahara* 111 ) furnishea an answer to this question. The follow- 
ing is the gist of its argument keeping as close to the original 
as possible. When a man throws an oblation into fire, his owner- 
ship over the oblation comes to an end; but the oblation 
belongs to nobody. No human being has accepted it. Yet 
the sacrificer can prevent any one who wants to desecrate the 
offering by bringing it into contact with something impure from 
doing so and can see to it that the offering is reduced to ashes in 
the fire undisturbed. Similarly when a tank or a garden is 
dedicated to the public, the ownership of the founder in the thing 
is gone, but there is no other individual owner and no new 
ownership arises in any single person ; yet the founder can 
prevent a third person making himself owner of the thing 
dedicated to the public and it cannot be argued that the founder 
cannot interfere for protecting the thing and that there is no 
blame if he does not safeguard the assumption of ownership 
by a third person. The practice of respectable, people viz. the 
exercise of the right of preservation in the case of both ( i. e. in 
the oase of what is offered into the fire and what is dedicated 
to the public ) is based on this consideration. The sSstric injunc- 
tion about utsarga does not merely contemplate the divesting

of one's ownership and dedication to the public, but also that 
the thing dedioated be enjoyed by the public without inter- 
ference or encroaohment, just as in noma also one does not 
merely desire to throw an oblation into fire (and rest content with 
that) but one desires to see that the oblation is reduced to ashes 
and is not rendered impure. This shows that the founder of 
a temple or the builder of a tank or garden would always 
retain a power to preserve the thing dedioated. 

Questions as to whether a new image can be substituted 
by the trustee or the shebait of a temple or whether he can 
remove the image to another place do come before the courts. 
Vide Kali Kanta Chatterji v. Surendra 41 0. L. J. 128 ; Pra. 
matha Natha v. Pradyunma Kumar 30 0. W. N. 25 ( P. 0.) where 
the P. 0. laid down ( p. 33 ) that family idols are not merely 
movable chattels and that their destruction, degradation and 
injury are not within the power of the founder or other custo- 
dian for the time being ; vide Hart Baghunath v. Anant Bhikaji 
44 Bom. 466, where it was held that the manager of a public 
temple has no right to remove the image from the old temple 
and instal it in another new building, especially when the 
removal is objected to by a majority of the worshippers. 



. CHAPTER XXVII 

VANAPRASTHA ( forest hermit ) 

Vaikhanasa appears to have been the ancient name for 
Vanaprastha. In the AnukramanI one hundred Vaikbanasas 
are said to have been the seers of Rg. IX. 66 and a Vamra 
Vaikh&nasa is the seer of Rg. X. 99. The Tai. A. I. 23 connects 
the word Vaikhanasa with the nakhas of Prajapati ( ye nakhas 
te vaikhanasah ). 8IIS It appears that in ancient times there was 
some work called Vaikhanasa sastra which treated of the rules 
for forest hermits. Gaut. III. 2 uses the word Vaikhanasa for 
this asrama. Baud. Dh. S. II. 6. 19 defines a vanaprastha 21 " as 
one who follows the practices laid down in Vaikhanasa-sastra. 
Vrddha-Gautama ( chap. VIII, p. 564 ) appears to suggest that 
Vaikhanasas and Pancaratrikas were two schools of Vaisnavas, 
the former calling Visnu by the appellations of Purusa, Acyuta 
and Aniruddha, while the Panoaratrikas spoke of Visnu as 
having the four murtis or vyuhas viz. Vasudeva, Sankarsana, 
Pradyumna and Aniruddha. 2117 The Par. M. vol. I, part 2, p. 139 
after quoting Vas. Dh. S. 9. 11 ( sramanakenagnimadhaya ) 
remarks that Sramanaka is Vaikhanasa-sufcra that propounds 
the duties of tapasvina. KalidSsa in the SSkuntala speaks of 
the life led by the oharming Sakuntala in Kanva's hermitage 
as vaikhanasa vrata mt ( I. 27 ). Manu VI. 21 describes the 
Vanaprastha as abiding by the views ( mata ) of Vaikhanasa 
and Medh&tihi explains that Vaikhanasa is a sastra in which 
the duties of the forest hermit are expounded. The MahS-

bhSrata 811 * (Santi 20. 6 and 26.6) states that the view of the 
Vaikh&nasas is that it is better to have no desire for amassing 
wealth than to hanker after wealth. SankarScSrya on VedSnta- 
sutra III. 4. 20 speaks of the third aarama as vaikhanasa and 
as indicated by the word tapas used in Chan. Up, II. 23. 1. 

The word vanaprastha is according to the Mit. the same 
as vanaprastha, which means ' one who stays in a forest in a 
pre-eminent way ' ( by observing a striot code of life ). Kslra- 
svSrol derives it differently.'" 

The time for becoming a forest hermit arises in two ways. 
Aooording to the Jabalopanisad quoted above (p. 421) a man may 
become a vanaprastha immediately after the period of student- 
hood or after passing some years as an householder. Manu 
(VI. 2) indioates the age by saying ' when a householder sees his 
skin wrinkled and his hair growing white and sees the sons of his 
sons he may betake himself to the forest '. The commentators 
were divided in their opinions, some holding that all three con- 
ditions ( wrinkles, grey hair and seeing son 's sons ) must be 
fulfilled before one oould beoome a forest hermit, others held 
that only one of them need be fulfilled and others again said 
that these conditions are only indicative of the age viz. that a 
man must be old or over 50. Kulluka on Manu III. 50 quotes 
a smrti ' a man may resort to a forest after 50 '.

46. 9-16, Laghu-Visnu III, KurmapurSna ( uttarSrdha chap. 27 ) 
contain numerous rules about forest hermits. The prinoipal 
points are stated below with a few references : 

(1) One may go to a forest with one's wife or one may 
leave her in oharge of one's sons ( Manu VI. 3, Yaj. III. 45 ). 
The wife may accompany if she desires. Medhatithi notes that 
some explained that if the wife was young he may place her in 
oharge of the sons and that an old wife may accompany her 
husband.

(2) He takes with him to the forest his three Vedio fires 
and his grhya fire 81 " together with such sacrificial utensils as 
the ladles called true, sruva. Ordinarily the wife's oo-opera- 
tion is required in offering sacrifices, but when the wife is given 
in charge of the sons, her co-operation then is supposed to be 
dispensed with or it may be held that she has consented to all 
acts by agreeing to stay with the sons. On repairing to the 
forest he should perform the srauta sacrifices of new moon and 
full moon, the agrayaya isti, the calurmasyas, Turayana and Dak- 
sayana ( Manu VI. 4. 9-10, Yaj. III. 45 ). The sacrificial food 
was to be prepared from corn like nivara growing in the forest. 
It appears that acoording to some writers the forest hermit was 
to give up his srauta and grhya fires and kindle a new fire in 
accordance with rules laid down in the sramanaka ,,M ( i. e. the 
Vaikhanasa sutra) and offer sacrifices therein. Vide Gaut. 
III. 26, Ap. Dh. S. II. 9. 21. 20 and Vas. Dh. S. IX. 10. 2in 

2121. If he has followed the ardhsdhUna mode, then he has sepa- 
rate drauta and grhya fires ; but if he has followed the ' aarvSdhSna 
mode, then he has only srauta fires, which alone he takes with him. 
When a man consecrates the three srauta fires he may do so with half 
of his smSrta tire and keep the other half of the smarts fire. This is 
ardhsdhsna. If he does not keep the emSrto fire separate it is sarva"- 
dbana. Vide Ip. Sr. V. 4. 12-16, V. 7. 8 and Nirnayasindhu ( III 
pUrvBrdba, p. 370 ). If he has no srauta fires then he takes only the 
grhya fire. One who has no wife living can also become a forest 
hermit. Vide Mit. on Ysj. III. 45. DsksByana is a modification of the 
DarsapHrnamSsa sacrifice ( Ap. Sr. III. 17. 4 and 11, Adv. Sr. II. 14. 73. 
and com. on Est. Sr. I. 2. 11 ) and TurByana if an istyayana according 
to £s>. Sr. II. 14. 4-6 and a sattra according to Ap. XXIII. 14. 1. 

2122. MedhStithi on Manu VI. 9 states that the SrSmanaka fire is 
to be kindled by him only whose wife is dead or who becomes a forest 
hermit immediately after tbe close of the period of student-hood.

Ultimately he is to leave the keeping of fires by depositing the 
sacred fires in his own self aooording to the rules prescribed 
( in Vaikhanasa sutra ). Vide Manu VI. 25, Yaj. III. 45. 

(3) He has to give up all food that he used to partake of 
when he was in his village and also all household parapher- 
nalia ( cows, horses, beds &c. ) and subsist on flowers, fruits, 
roots and vegetables growing in the forest on land or in water or 
on corn fit for sages such as nlv&ra and sy&maka ( Manu VI. 5 
and 13, Gaut. III. 26 and 28 ). But he has to avoid partaking 
of honey, flesh, mushrooms growing on the ground, and the 
vegetables called Bhustrna, Sigruka, the Slesmataka fruit, 
though these are forest produce ( Manu VI. 14 ). Gautama 
allowed him as a last resort to partake of the flesh of animals 
killed by carnivorous beasts. Yaj. III. 54-55, Manu VI. 27-28 
allow him to beg for alms at the dwellings of other hermits or 
allow him to go to a village and bring by begging silently 
eight morsels of food. He can use salt prepared by himself 
only ( Manu VI. 12 ). 

(4) He has to perform the five daily sacrifices to gods, 
sages, Manes, men ( guests ) and to bhutas with food fit for 
ascetics or with fruits, roots and vegetables and give alms 
thereout ( Manu VI. 5 and 7, Gaut. III. 29-30, Yaj. III. 46 ). 

(5) He has to bathe thrice in the day, in the morning, 
at noon and in the evening ( Manu VI. 22 and 24, Yaj. III. 48, 
Vas. IX 9 ) ; while Manu VI. 6 appears to prescribe a bath 
twice a day only in the morning and in the evening. So there 
was an option. 

(6) He was to wear a deer-skin or a tattered garment ( i.e. 
one of bark or kusa grass or the like ) and allow his hair and 
nails to grow. Vide Manu VI 6, Gaut. III. 34, Vas. IX. 11. 

(7) He should be devoted to the study of the Veda and 
reoite it inaudibly ( Sp. Dh. S. II 9. 22. 9, Manu VI. 8, Yfij. 
III. 48 ). 

(8) He should live a life of complete continence, should 
be self-restrained, friendly (to all), collected in mind, ever 
liberal but never a recipient and be compassionate towards all 
beings ( Manu VI. 8, Yaj. III. 45 and 48 ). In view of Yaj. 
III. 45, Vas. IX 5 and Manu VI. 26, Kulluka seems ,IH to be

wrong in holding that if a forest hermit takes his wife with him 
he may cohabit with her at the prescribed times. 

(9) He is not to use corn growing on ploughed land in 
the forest even if the owner negleots to garner it nor is he to 
eat fruits and roots growing in villages ( Manu VI. 16 and 
Yaj. III. 46 ). 

(10) He may cook wild corn or he may eat only what 
becomes naturally ripe ( like fruits ) or he may pound between 
stones the grain to be used by him, or may employ his teeth 
only as mortar and he is not to employ ghee in bis cooking 
or religious rites but only the oil of wild fruits ( Manu VI. 17 
and Yaj. III. 49 ). 

(11) He is to eat only onoe either in the day in the 
4th part ( of the day divided into eight ) or at night or he may 
take food every alternate day or once after two or three days 
( Visnu Dh. S. 95. 5-6, Manu VI. 19 ). He may also follow 
the method of the penance of Candrayana ( stated in Manu 
XI. 216) or he may subsist on wild fruits, roots and flowers 
only ( Manu VI. 20-21, Yaj. III. 50 ) or may eat only once 
at the end of a fortnight ( according to one's ability ). He may 
reduce gradually the" quantity of food he takes, ultimately 
subsisting on water alone or on wind ( Ap. Dh. S. II. 9. 23. 2, 
Manu VI. 31 ). Vide Visnu Dh. S. 95. 7-12 also. 

(12) He may accumulate food materials only for a day 
or a month or a year ( but never for more than a year ) and 
should throw away his stored food material every year in the 
month of Asvina ( Manu VI. 15, Yaj. III. 47, Ap. Dh. S. II. 
9. 22. 24 )."" 

(13) He should practise severe austerities by standing 
in the midst of five fires ( 4 fires in the four directions and 
the blazing sun overhead ), by standing in the open in the rains, 
by wearing wet garments in winter (Manu VI. 23-34, Yaj. 
III. 52, Visnu Dh. S. 95. 2-4 ) and thus habituate his body to 
privations and mortifications. 

(14) He should gradually give up residing in a houee, 
but Bhould stay under a tree and subsist only on fruits and 
roots"' 6 (Manu VI. 25, Vas. IX. 11, Yaj. III. 54, Ap. Dh. S. 
II. 9. 21.20).

(15) At night he should sleep on the bare ground, should 
pass the day either sitting or moving about or in the practice 
of Yoga and should make no effort to enjoy the things that give 
pleasures ( Manu VI. 22 and 26, Yaj. III. 51 ). 

(16) He should study the various texts of the Upanisads 
for the purity of his body, for the inorease of his knowledge 
and ultimately for realising brahma ( Manu VI. 29-30). 

(17) If the forest hermit suffers from some incurable 
disease and cannot properly perform his duties or feels death 
to be near, he should start on the great journey (Mahapra- 
sthana) turning his faoe towards the north-east, subsisting on 
water and air only, till the body falls to rise no more ( Manu 
VI. 31, Yaj. III. 55). The Mit. and Apararka (p. 945) on 
Yftj. III. 55 quote a smrti ' a forest hermit may resort to the 
distant journey or may enter water or fire or may throw him- 
self from a precipioe *. ,m 

The Baud. Dh. S. III. 3 gives an intricate classification of 
vfinaprasthas. They are either pacamanakaa ( who take cooked or 
ripe food) or apocamanakos ( who do not oook their food ). Each 
of these two classes is again sub-divided into five. The five 
pacamanakaa are sarv&ranyakas, vaitusikas, those who subsist 
on fruits, roots and bulbous roots, those who subsist . on fruits 
only, those who subsist on vegetables only. Sarvaranyakas are 
of two kinds, viz. indravasiktaa ( who bring creepers, shrubs and 
cook them, offer agnihotra therewith and offer it to guests and 
eat the rest ) and reto-vasiktas ( who bring the flesh of animals 
killed by tigers, wolves or hawks and cook it and offer to 
Agni &o. ). The apacamanakas are five viz. unmajjakas ( who 
do not employ implements of iron or stone for holding food ), 
pravfttaiinah ( who eat food from their hands, without using 
any vessel ), mukhenadayinah ( who eat food with their mouth, 
without using their hands, as beasts do ), toyaharas (who subsist 
on water only ), vayubhaksah ( who observe total fast ). These 
are according to Baud, the ten dikqaa of Vaikh&nasas. Manu 
also ( VI. 29 ) calls the rules to be observed by forest hermits 
dlksas. 

Brhat-ParSsara ( chap. XL p. 290 ) speaks of four divisions 
of vftnaprasthas viz. VaikhSnasa, Udumbara, Valakhilya and

VanevasI; while Vaikh. VIII. V says that the vanaprasthas are 
either sapalnlka ( who stay with their wife ) or apatnlka and the 
first are of four varieties viz. Audumbara, Vairifioa, VSlakhilya 
and Phenapa. The Ramayana ( Aranya, chap. 10. 2-6 ) speaks 
of forest hermits under various designations suoh as the 
Valakhilyas, Asmakut^as &o. 

Any person of the three higher varnas oould beoome a 
vanaprastha, but a sudra oould not do so. Manu VI. 1 when 
starting the topic of vanaprasthas employs the word ' dvija '. 
In the Santiparva 21. 15 it is stated that a ksatriya after trans- 
ferring the kingdom to his son should subsist in a forest on 
wild food and follow the sravana soriptures."' 8 In the Asva- 
medhika-parva 35. 43 it is expressly stated that the order of 
vanaprasthas is meant for the three dmjQtis. tm The Mahabharata 
oites many examples of royal personages becoming vanapras- 
thas. Yayati after crowning his youngest and most dutiful son 
Puru as a king is said to have become a forest hermit (Adiparva 
86. 1 ) where he practised various austerities ( Adi. 86. 12-17 ) 
and ultimately ended his life by fasting ( Adi. 75. 58 ). In the 
Asramavasi-parva ( ohap. 19 ) the blind king Dhrtarastra is said 
to have become a forest hermit with his wife Gandharl who put 
on bark garments and deer-skin. The Par. M. ( I. part 2, p. 139 ) 
relying on Manu VI. 2, Yama and other sages states its view that 
men of the three varnas could become forest hermits. Women 
also could repair to the forest. The Mausala parva-(7. 74) states 
that when Krsna left the mortal body, Satyabhama and other 
queens of Krsna entered the forest having resolved to undergo 
severe austerities. The Adiparva ( 128. 12-13 ) narrates that 
on the death of Pandu, SatyavatI with her two daughters-in-law 
repaired to a forest for austerities and died (here. Vide also 
Sanfci 147. 10 ( for Mahaprasthana ) and Asramavasiparva. 37. 
27-28. Acoording to Vaik. VIII. 1 and Vamanapurana 14. 
117-118 a brahmana oould pass through all four asramas, a 
ksatriya through three ( he could not be a sannyasin ), a vaisya

through two (brahmacarya and gSrbastbya) and a sadra could 
resort to only one viz. the householder's mode of life. Vide the 
Btory of Sambuka referred to above (p. 119 ). 

The question whether ending one's life by starting on the 
Great Journey or by falling from a precipice is sinful exercised 
the minds of many writers on dharmasastra. The Dharmasastra 
writers generally condemn suicide or an attempt to commit 
suioide as a great sin. Par&sara ( IV. 1-2 ) states that if a man 
or woman hangB himself or herself through extreme pride or 
extreme rage or through affliction or fear he or she falls into 
hell for sixty thousand years."* Manu V. 89 says that no water 
is to be offered for the benefit of the souls of those who kill them- 
selves. The Adiparva ( 179. 20 ) declares that one who commits 
suioide does not reach blissful worlds. Vas. Dh. S. ( 23. 14-16 ) 
ordains " whoever kills himself becomes abhiiasta ( guilty of 
mortal sin) and his sapincjm have to perform no death rites 
for him ; a man becomes a killer of the self when he destroys 
himself by wood ( i. e. by fire ), water, clods and stones 
( i. e. by striking his head against a stone ), weapon, poison, or 
ropes ( i. e. by hanging ). They also quote a verse ' that dvija 
who through affection performs the last rites of a man who 
commits suicide must undergo the penance of Candrayana with 
Tapta-krcohra ". Vas. Dh. S. 23. 18 prescribes a prayascitta for 
merely resolving to kill oneself ( even when no attempt is 
made ). Yama ( 20-21 ) prescribes that when a person tries to 
do away with himself by suoh methods as hanging, if be dies, 
his body should be smeared with impure things and if he lives 
he should be fined two hundred pavas; his friends and sons 
should eaoh be fined one paw and then they should undergo the 
penance laid down in the sastra.* 1 * 1 

In spite of this general attitude, exceptions were made in 
the smrtis, the epics and puranas. When a man was guilty of 
brahmana murder, he was allowed to meet death at the hands of

downwards in fire (Manu "XI. 73, Yaj. III. 248 ). Similarly the 
drinker of spirituous liquor expiated his sin by taking boiling 
wine, water, ghee, cow's milk or urine and dying thereby 
( Manu XI. 90-91, Yaj. III. 253, Gaut. 23. 1, Vas. Dh. 8. 20. 22 ). 
Vide also Vas. Dh. 8. 13. 14, Gaut. 23. 1, Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 9. 25. 1-3 
and 6 for similar deadly penanoes for incest and for drinking 
liquor and for theft. The Ap.Dh.S. (1.10.28. 15-17) quotes Harlta 
who condemns such penances involving death.*'" At extremely 
holy places like Prayaga, the SarasvaM and Benares persons were 
allowed to kill themselves by drowning with the desire of 
securing release from samsara. The Salyaparva (39. 33-34) 
states ' whoever abandons his body at Prthudaka on the northern 
bank of the SarasvatI after repeating Vedic prayers would not 
be troubled by death thereafter '."** The Anusasanaparva ( 25. 
62-64 ) says that if a man knowing the Vedanta and under- 
standing the ephemeral nature of life abandons life in the holy 
Himalayas by fasting, he would reach the world of brahma. 
Vide also Vanaparva 85. 83 ( about suicides at Prayaga ). The 
Matsya-purana (186. 34-35) eulogises the peak of Amarakan^aka 
by stating ' whoever dies at Amarakan^aka by fire, poison, water 
or by fasting enjoys the pleasures ( described in verses 28-33 ). 
He who throws himself down (from the peaks of Amarakan^aka ) 
never returns ( to samsara ).' m * 

There are historioal examples of this practice supplied by 
Epigraphy. The Khairha plates of Yasahkarnadeva ( dated 
Ealacuri saihvat 823 i. e. 1073 A. D. ) narrate that king Gangeya 
obtained release along with his one hundred wives at the 
famous banyan tree of Prayaga ( E. I. vol. XII. p. 205 at p. 
211)."" King Dhangadeva of the Ohandella dynasty is said 
to have lived for more than 100 years and to have abandoned 
his body at Prayaga while contemplating on Rudra ( E. I. vol. 
I. p. 140 ). The Calukya king Sotnesvara after performing yoga

rites drowned himself in the Tuhgabhadra in 1068 A. D. ( E. 0. 
vol. II. Sk. 136). The Raghuvaihia VIII. 94 poetically describes 
how Aja in his old age when his health was shattered by disease 
resorted to fasting and drowned himself at the confluence of the 
holy rivers, the Ganges and the Sarayu, and immediately 
attained the position of a denizen of Heaven. 

Apart from suicide for purposes of penance or at holy places 
the smrtis allowed, as said above, a forest hermit to start on the 
great journey to meet death and also allowed in certain circum- 
stances death by entering fire, or by drowning or by fasting 
or by throwing oneself from a preoipice even for those who 
were not hermits. Gautama ( 14. 11 ) prescribes that no mour- 
ning need be observed for those who wilfully meet death by 
fasting, or by outting themselves off with a weapon, or by fire, 
or poison or water or by hanging or by falling from a preoipice. 
But Atri ( 218-219 ) states some exceptions viz. 'if one who is 
very old ( beyond 70 ), one who cannot observe the rules of 
bodily purification ( owing to extreme weakness &o. ), one who 
is so ill that no medical help can be given, kills himself by 
throwing himself from a precipioe or into fire or water or by 
fasting, mourning should be observed for him for three days and 
srSddha may be performed for him. 8IW Apararka ( p. 536 ) 
quotes texts of Brahmagarbha, Vivasvat and Gargya about an 
householder 'he who suffering from serious illness cannot live, 
or who is very old, who has no desire left for the pleasures of 
any of the senses and who has carried out his tasks may bring 
about his death at his pleasure by resorting to mahaprasth&na, 
by entering fire or water or by falling from a precipioe. By so 
doing he incurs no sin and his death is far better than tapas, 
and one should not desire to live vainly ( without being able to 
perform the duties laid down by the sSstra). ,,,T AparSrka 
( p. 877 ) and Par. M. ( I. part 2, p. 228 ) quote several verses 
from Adipurana about dying by fasting, by entering fire or 
deep water cr by falling from a precipice, or by gorng on mahs-

prasthana in the Himalayas or by abandoning life from the 
branch of the va^a tree at PraySga, the verses declaring that 
not only does such a man not incur sin but he attains the 
worlds of bliss. In the Raraayaua ( Aranya, chap. 9 ) Sara- 
bhanga is said to have entered fire. We find that the Mrccha- 
katfka ( I. 4 ) speaks of king Sudraka as having entered fire. 
In the Gupta Inscriptions No. 42, the great Emperor Kumara- 
gupta is said to have entered the fire of dried cowdung cakes. 
The editor remarks that there is necessarily no reference to the 
fact that the emperor voluntarily embraced death by fire. But 
it appears that there is no great propriety in the description 
if all that is meant is that the Emperor's dorpse was burnt 
with 'karlsa*. 

Some put forward a Vedio passage ' one who desires heaven 
should not (seek to) die before the appointed span of life is at 
an end (of itself)' as opposed to the permission for suicide 
given by the smrtis. MedhStithi on Manu VI. 32 ,IM quotes 
this Vedio text and explains it away by saying that if iruU 
intended to lay down an absolute prohibition against suicide 
in every case, it would have simply said ' one who desires 
heaven should not ( seek to ) die '. The V&j. S. ( 40. 3 ) contains 
a verse saying ' whoever destroy their self reach after death 
Asura worlds that are shrouded in blinding darkness', which 
really refers to persons ignorant of the correct knowledge of the 
Self. But this has been interpreted by many as referring to 
those guilty of suicide (atmahan). Vide Uttararamacarita IV, 
after verse 3 ut% and Br. Up. IV. 4. 11 for a verse similar to 
that in the Vaj. S. The Rajatarangiol (VI. 1411 ) refers to 
officers appointed by the king to superintend prSyopaveia 
( resolving on death by fasting ). 

Among Jains a similar rule prevailed. The Ratnakaranda- 
sravakacara ( chap. 5 ) of Samantabhadra ( about 2nd century 
A. D.) dilates on Sallekhana, which consists in abandoning the 
body for the accumulation of merit in calamities, famines,

extreme old age and incurable disease. m0 The Kalandrl 
(Sirohi State) Inscription reoords the suicide of a Jain con- 
gregation by fasting in samvat 1389 ( E. I. vol. XX., appendix 
p. 98 No. 691). 

From the aooount of the death of Kalanos the Indian 
gymnosophist at 73 given by Megasthenes (Mo Orindle p. 106) 
we can gather that the practice of religious suicide prevailed 
long before the 4th century B. 0. Strabo ( XV. 1. 4 ) states that 
with the ambassadors that came to Augustus Caesar from India 
also arrived an Indian gymnosophist who committed himself 
to the flames like Kalanos who exhibited the same -spectacle 
before Alexander. 

In the times of the puranas the method of starting on maha- 
prasthana and suicide by entering fire or falling from a preci- 
pice came to be forbidden and was included in Kalivarjya."" 

It will be noticed that some of the duties and regulations 
prescribed for vanaprasthas are practically the same as those 
for sannyasins. For example, the rules laid down in Manu 
VI. 25-29 for forest hermits are almost the same as those for 
parivrajakaa™ ( Manu VI. 38, 43, 44). The Ap. Dh, S. employs 
the same words twice in delineating the characteristics of both 
( II. 9. 21. 10 and 20). The order of hermits gradually leads on 
to or rather passes over into that of sannyasins. Both have to 
observe celibacy and restraint of senses, both have to regulate 
the intake and quality of food, both have to contemplate on the 
passages of the Upaniaads and strive for the knowledge of 
Brahman. There were no doubt some differences. The vana- 
prastha oould be aooompanied by his wife at least in the begin- 
ning, a sannyasin oould not be so. A vanaprastha had to keep 
fires, perform the daily and other yajfias at least in the begin- 
ning, the sannyftsin gave up his fires. The vanaprastha had to 
concentrate upon tapas, upon inuring himself to privations, 
severe austerities, and self-mortification, while the sannyasin

was concerned principally with samyama (restraint or quies- 
cence of senses) and contemplation of the highest Reality, as 
stated by SamkarScSrya on Vedantasutra III. 4. 20."** Owing 
to the great similarity and virtual fusion of the two asramas 
the stage of vanaprastha came to be gradually ignored and people 
passed from the householder's life directly to the life of 
sannyasa. Govindasv&ml on Baud. Dh. S. III. 3. 14-17 remarks 
that the acarya (Baudhayana) should be asked why he describes 
the two orders 'of vanaprastha and sannySsa as distinct. 11 ** In 
oourse of time no one probably beoame a vanaprastha and 
therefore having reoourse to the stage of vanaprastha came to 
be forbidden in the Eali age.' 1 "

CHAPTER XXVIII 

SANNYASA 

Sannyasa. — ( the order of ascetics ). That the Chan. Up. 
was well aware of the three asramas of student-hood, house- 
holder and forest hermit has been shown above ( p. 420 ). 
It is somewhat doubtful whether the Chan. Up. regarded 
sannyasa as the fourth and the last stage in a man's life when 
ideally planned. It merely states that ' one that holds fast by 
the realization of brahman attains immortality'. But it 
appears that a stage of the abandonment of worldly riches, a 
life of begging and contemplation of the Absolute and its reali- 
zation had been known to the earliest Upanisads like the 
BrhadSranyaka. Whether it was the fourth stage or whether it 
could be reached even in the stage of brahmaoarya or of a 
house-holder is left in doubt so far as the older Upanisads 
are concerned. The Jabalopanisad (4) has been quoted above 
( p. 421 ) to show that it gave an option either to regard sannyasa 
as the 4th stage in a man's life or to resort to it immediately 
after any of the first two airamas. 

In the Br. Up. (II. 4. 1 ) we see that Yajfiavalkya 8ue when 
about to become aparivrajaka (a wandering ascetic) tells his wife 
Maitreyl that he was going to leave home and that he wanted 
to divide whatever wealth he had between her and her co-wife 
Katyayanl. This shows that a parivrajaka had even then to 
leave home and wife and to give up all belongings. The same 
Upanisad in another place ( III. 5. 1 ) states ' those who realize 
Atman give up the hankering after progeny, possessions 
and heavenly worlds and praotise the beggar's mode of life ; 
therefore the brfihmana, having completely mastered (and so risen 
beyond ) mere learning, should seek to be like a child ( i. e. 
should not make a parade of his latent capacities or know- 
ledge ) and having completed ( gone beyond ) knowledge and

bdlya ( child-like behaviour ) he should attain to the position of 
a muni, and having risen beyond the stage of a muni or non- 
mum, should become a real brahmana ( one who has realized 
brahman ). Vide also Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 for similar words and 
sentiments. The Jabalopanisad (5) m7 declares that the ascetic 
( parivrat ) wears discoloured ( not white ) garments, has a 
tonsured head, has no possessions, is pure, hates ( or injures ) no 
one, begs for alms and thereby tends to attain non-difference 
from brahmafk In the Paramaharhsa, the Brahma, the Narada- 
parivrajaka, and the Sannyasa Upanisads numerous rules 
are laid down about sannyasa. But the antiquity and the 
authenticity of these Upanisads is extremely doubtful and 
therefore passing them over attention will be confined to the 
dharmasutras and other ancient smrtis.

( Uttarardha, ohap. 28 ), Agnipurana 161 and many other smrtis 
and puranas dilate upon the characteristics and duties of ascetics 
( yatidharma ). Some of the most salient features are set out 
below with a few references. 

(1) In order to qualify himself for sannyasa, a person 
had to perform a sacrifice to Prajapati in whioh whatever he had 
he distributed to priests and the poor and the helpless ( Manu 
VI. 38, Yaj. III. 56, Visnu Dh. S. 96. 1, Sankha VII. 1 ). m8 
TheYatidharmasangraha( p. 13 ) prescribes that the PrajSpatyesti 
should be performed by him who had kept the three vedio fires and 
the isti to Agni should be performed by others who kept only 
the grhya fire. The Jabalopanisad 4 adds that the sacrifice 
should be for Agni (and not for Prajapati as some hold ). The

Nrsimhapurana ( 60. 2-4 ) requires that before entering upon 
this order one should perform eight sr&ddhas. The Nrsimha- 
purana 58. 36 allows every one who is a vedio student to 
beoome an ascetic if his tongue, bis sexual emotions, his appe- 
tite for food and his speech are pure ( i. e. under strict control )• 
The eight sraddhas are daiva (to Vasus, Budras, Adit y as), area 
( to the ten sages viz. Marlci and others), divya (to Hiranya- 
garbha and Vairaja ), mSnusya ( to Sanaka, Sanandana and five 
others), bhautika (to five bhutas, prthvl &c. ),# paitrka (to 
Kavyavad fire, Soma, Aryaman, pitrs called Agnisvatta &o. ), 
matrsraddha ( to ten matrs such as Gaurl, Padma ), atmasraddha 
( to Paramatman ). Vide Yati-dh. p. 9 and Sm. M. p. 177. Manu 
is oaref ul to point out ( VI. 35-37 ) that a man should fix his 
mind on moksa after studying the Veda, procreating sons, 
performing sacrifices i. e. after discharging his debts to the 
sages, the pitrs and gods. Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 3-6 and 
Vaik. IX. 6 state that an householder who has no children or 
whose wife is dead or who has established his children in the 
path of dharma or who is over 70 may become an ascetic. 
Kautilya ( II. 1 ) prescribes that if a person embraces the order 
of asoetics without making proper provision for his wife and 
sons he shall be punished with the first ammeroement. "" He 
has to deposit his fires in himself and leave home (Manu 
VL 38 ). 

(2) After leaving home, wife, children and possessions, 
he should dwell outside the villages, should be homeless and 
stay under a tree or in an un-inhabited house wherever he may 
be when the sun sets and should always wander from place to 
place ; but he may remain in one place only in the rainy sea- 
son"* (Manu VI. 41, 43-44, Vas. Dh. S. X 12-15, Sankha 
VII. 6 ). Sankha ( quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 58 ) allows 
him to stay in one place only for two months in the rains, while 
Kanva says that he may stay one night in a village and five in 
a town ( except in the rains ). When he follows the rule of 
staying four or two months in one place, he should do so from 
the full moon of Asfidha or an ascetic may always stay on the 
banks of the Ganges.

(3) He should always wander alone without a com- 
panion*, as by so doing he will be free from attachments and the 
pangs of separation. Daksa (VII. 34-38 ) emphasizes this"* 1 
point very well ' the real ascetic always stays alone ; if two 
stay together, they form a pair; if three stay together they are 
like a village and if more (than three stay together) then it 
becomes like a town. An ascetic should not form a pair or a 
village or a town; by so doing he swerves from his dharma, 
sinoe ( if two or more stay together ) they begin to exchange 
news about the ruling prince, about the alms obtained and by 
olose oontaot sentiments of affection, jealousy or wickedness 
arise between them. Bad ascetics engage in many activities 
viz. expounding (testa) for seouring money or honour and also 
gathering pupils round them. There are only four proper 
actions for an ascetic and no fifth viz. contemplation, purity, 
begging, always staying alone'. Narada says 'there are sir 
acts which ascetios must do as if ordered by the king under the 
threat of a penalty viz. begging, japa, contemplation, bath 
( thrice daily ), purity and worship of Siva or Visnu ( quoted in 
Yati-dh. p. 62 and Sm. M. p. 188). m, » 

(4) He should be celibate, should always be devoted to 
contemplation and spiritual knowledge and should be un- 
attached to all objects of sense and pleasure ( Manu VI. 41 and 
49,GautIII. 11). 

(5) He should move about avoiding all trouble or injury 
to creatures, should make all creatures safe with him, should 
bear with indifference all disrespect, should entertain no anger 
towards him who is furious with him, should utter benedictions 
over him also who runs him down, should never utter an untruth 
( Manu VI. 40, 47-48, Yaj. III. 61, Gaut. III. 23 ). 

(6) He should neither kindle srauta fires nor grhya fire 
nor even ordinary fire for cooking food and should subsist on

a day, he should nob ordinarily stay in a village at night 
(exoept in the rains) but if he stays at all he should do so only 
for one night ( Gaut. III. 13 and 20, Manu VI. 43, 55 ). 

(8) He should beg alms from seven houses without 

selecting them beforehand ( Vas. Dh. S. X 7, Sankha VII. 3i 

Adi. 119. 12 * five or ten houses * ). Baud. Dh. S. ( II. 10. 57-58 ) 

prescribes that he should visit for alms the houses of brahmana 

householders of the Sallna and Yayavara types and should only 

wait for as much time as would be required for milking a cow. 

Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 69 quotes the view of others that an ascetic 

may take alms from persons of all varnas or food from only 

one among dvijatis ; Vas. X. 24 also says that he should beg 

of brahmanas only. The Vayupurana 1. 18. 17 prescribes that 

ascetics should not eat food belonging to one man ( but should 

eat food collected from several houses ), or flesh or honey 

should not accept amasrSddha ( i. e. sraddha with uncooked 

food ), should not use salt directly or by itself ( i. e. they may 

eat vegetables in oooking which salt has been used ). According 

to Usanas ( quoted in Sm. M. p. 200 and Yati-dh. pp. 74-75 ) 

food obtained by begging is of five kinds viz. madhukara 

( collecting food from any three, five or seven houses at random 

just as bees collect honey from any flowers), prakpratfita 

(when a request is made by devotees to take food at their 

houses even before the ascetic gets up from his bed ), ayacita 

( when invitation to take food at his house is given by a man 

before the ascetio starts on his begging round), tatkalika (the 

food that is announced by a brahmana the moment the ascetio 

approaches ), upapanna ( cooked food brought to the matha by 

devoted disciples or other people ). Vas. Dh. S. X. 31 says that 

a brahmana ascetio should avoid food at sudra houses and 

Apararka p. 963 explains this as implying that in the 

absence of brahmana houses an ascetio may beg for food from 

ksatriyas and vaisyas. In later times begging alms from 

persons of all castes was forbidden, being included among 

kalivarjya actions ('yates tu sarva-varnesu na bhiksacaranam 

kalau ' ). Vide Sm. M. p. 201. It was stated by Parasara and 

Kratu that no fault attaches to an ascetio if he being very 

old or very ill took food from a single person on a certain day 

or for several days or begged for food at the house of his song, 



Oh. XXVIII ] SannyHUa 935 

friends, teacher or brothers or wife ( vide Sm. M. p. 201, Yati- 
dh. p. 75 ). According to Parasara I. 51 and the Sutasamhita 
( Jfiana-yoga-khanda 4. 15-16) the first olaim on the food 
cooked in the house is that of an ascetic and a brahmaoarin 
and one has to perform the Candr&yana penance for taking 
one's meals without giving alms to them. In giving food to 
an asoetio first water is poured on his hand, then food is given 
and then again water is poured on his hand ( Parasara I. 53 
quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. V. 16 ). Vide Ap. Dh. S. II. 1. 4. 
10 and Yftj. 1. 107. 

(9) He should go out for begging when the smoke from 
kitchens has ceased to rise and when the noise of pestles has 
died down and the live ooals ( in the kitohen ) have been 
extinguished and the plates used for the dining ( by the house- 
holders ) have been kept aside i. e. he should beg food in the 
evening(ManuVI.56,Yaj.III.59,Vas.X.8,Sankha VII. 8). He 
should not take as alms honey or flesh ( Vas. X. 24). He should 
not endeavour to secure alms by the practice of predicting, 
interpreting portents and omens or by the praotioe of descri- 
bing the consequences indicated by them, nor by astrology 
nor by expounding the principles of a lore nor by casuistry 
( or discussion ) nor should he approaoh a house that is already 
besieged by hermits, brahmanas, birds and dogs, beggars or 
others ( Manu VI. 50-51 ). 

(10) He should not eat food to satiety, but should eat 
only as much as is necessary to keep body and soul together 
and should not feel delight when he gets substantial alms nor 
feel dejected when he gets little or nothing ( Manu VI. 57 and 
59, Vas. X 21,22 and 25, Yaj. III. 59 ). There is a famous 
verse ' an ascetic should take only eight morsels of food, a 
forest hermit 16, a householder 32 and a vedio student an unli- 
mited number ' ( Ap. Dh. S. II. 4. 9. 13, Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 68 ). 

(11) He should hoard nothing and he should own or 
possess nothing except his tattered garments, his water jar, 
begging bowl ( Manu VI. 43-44, Gaut. IIL 10, Vas. X. 6 ). 
Devala quoted by the Mit. on Yftj. III. 58 deolares that the 
asoetic should possess only a water-jar, a pavitra ( oloth for 
straining water ), pfidukfts, an Ssana and a kantha ( wallet for 
protection from extreme cold). The Mahabharata states that 
wearing ochre-coloured garments, shaving the head, and keeping 
a water jar and three staffs— these are only outward signs meant 



936 History of Dharmaiaatra [ Oh. XXVIII 

to secure food and do not lead to moksa ,1,,b (dialogue of Janaka 
and Sulabba). The Mahabhasya ( vol. I. p. 365 ) also deolares 
that a man is known to be a parivrajaka on seeing his three 
staffs. The Vayupurana I. 8 ( quoted by AparSrka pp. 949-950 ) 
lays down what he should possess. He should take a staff 
of bamboo the outward surface of which is intact, which is 
not formidable and which has the parvana ( the parts between 
the joints ) of equal length, whioh is surrounded by a rope of 
cow's tail hair four angulas in length and has three knots and 
which he holds in his right hand ; he should have a sikya 
( loop on whioh to carry his jar or other things ) made of kusa 
or ootton or hemp threads or strings and of the form of a lotus 
and six mustfs ( fists ) in length ; he should also have a water 
jar and a patra ( vessel or bowl for begging ); he may have a 
seat ( Ssana ) of wood square or round in size for sitting on or 
for washing his feet ; he should have a loin-cloth to cover his 
private parts and a kantha ( patched garment or wallet ) for 
protection against cold and he may have two pSdukSs (sandals). 
He should have only these and should not accumulate any- 
thing else. 

(12) He should wear garments only for covering his pri- 
vate parts and may wear such garments as were worn by others 
and are used by him after washing ( Gaut. IIL 17-18 ), while 
Ap. Dh. S. ( IL 9. 21. 11-12 ) states that he should wear clothes 
thrown away by others and that some say that he may be 
naked. Vas. ( X. 9-11 ) says that he should cover his body with 
a pieoe of cloth ( s5tf ) or with deer skin or with grass cut down 
for cows. Baud. Dh. S. II. 6. 24 requires that his garments 
should be ochre-coloured ( quoted by Aparftrka p. 962 ). 

(13) The begging bowl and the plate from which the 
ascetic eats should be made of clay or wood or of a gourd, or of 
bamboo whioh should be without holes and he should not use 
metal vessels ; and these vessels are to be cleaned, with water 
and scoured with cow's hair ( Manu VI. 53-54, Y&j. III. 60 and 
Laghu-Visnu IV. 29-30 ). 

(14) He should pare his nails, cut all his hair and beard 
( Manu VI. 52, Vas. Dh. S. X. 6 ) ; but Gaut. III. 21 appears to

allow him an option viz. be may tonsure the whole head or keep 
only a top-knot. 

(15) He. should sleep on raised ground (sthandiia), 
should feel no oonoern if he suffers from an illness, he should 
neither welcome death nor should he feel joy for continuing to 
live, but he should patiently wait till the time of death, as a 
servant waits till the time he is hired expires ( Manu 
VI. 43 and 46 ). 

(16) He should generally observe silence except when 
he repeats the Vedio texts learnt by him ( Manu VI. 43, Gaut. 
III. 16, Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 79, Ap. Db. S. II. 9. 31. 10 ) .»" 

(17) He should be tridaydi ( carrying three staffs ) 
according to Yaj. III. 58, while Manu VI. 52 simply says he 
should be dandi ( i. e. carrying a staff). The word danda is used 
in two senses, a staff of bamboo or restraint. Baud. Dh. S. II. 
10. 53 gives an option that he may be ekadarid* or a tridandl 
and also says that he should not cause harm to oreatures by 
speech, actions and mind (II. 6. 25). Manu XII. 10, which is the 
same as Daksa (VII. 30), declares that that man is called tridandl 
who has restraint over his speech, mind and body. Daksa 
makes certain apt remarks ' Even gods who pre eminently 
possess the sattvaguna are carried away by pleasures of sense ; 
what of men ? Therefore he who has given up his taste for 
pleasures should resort to danda ; others cannot do it as they 
will be carried away by pleasures. An ascetic is not called 
tridandl by carrying bamboo Btaffs; he is triJavdi who has the 
spiritual danda in him. Many people make their livelihood 
under the guise of ( carrying ) three dandas ' ( VII. 27-31, quoted 
by Apararka p. 953 ). Restraint of speech requires, that he 
should observe silenoe, restraint of aotion that he should cause 
injury to no oreature and restraint of mind that he should 
engage in pranayama and other yogio practices. Daksa him- 
self says ( I. 12-13 ) that the three staffs are the special out- 
ward sign of a yati as the girdle, deer-skin and staff are the out- 
ward signs of the vedic student or long nails and beard are 
indicia of the forest hermit. Laghu-Visnu IV. 12 says he may 
be ekadandl or tridandl. The Jlvanamuktiviveka (p. 154)

quotes verses to the effect 'he who wields the staff of the know- 
ledge of Reality is called ekadandi, while he"who~merely holds 
a stick in his hand without knowledge and eats everything ( or 
has all sorts of desires ) reaches terrible hells '• 

(18) He should recite the vedic texts referring to yajfias 
or gods or texts of a metaphysical character found in the 
VedSnta ( euoh as ' satyam jMnam-anantam brahraa ' in Tai. 
Up. 2. 1 ). Vide Manu VI. 83. 

(19) He should walk after ascertaining with his eye that 
the ground he treads is pure, should drink water after passing it 
through a piece of cloth ( in order to prevent ants &o. being 
taken in by him ), he should utter words purified by truth and 
should do what his conscience ( inner voice ) decides to be right 
or proper (Manu VI. 46, Sankha VII. 7, Visnu Dh. S. 96. 14-17). 

(20) In order to generate the feeling of vairagya ( desire- 
lessness ) and to curb his senses he should make his mind dwell 
upon the body as liable to disease and old age and as packed 
full of impurities ; and should revolve in his mind the transitory 
nature of all mundane things, the trouble one has to undergo in 
body and mind from conception to death, the incessant round of 
births and deaths (Manu VI. 76-77, Y&j. III. 63-64, Visnu 
Dh. S. 96. 25-42 ). 

(21) Truthfulness, not depriving another of his posses- 
sions or his due, absenoe of wrath ( even against one who 
harms), humility, purity ( of body and food &c. ), discrimina- 
tion, steadiness of mind ( in sorrow ), quiescence ( or restraint ) 
of mind, restraint of senses, knowledge ( of the self ), these are 
the dharma of all varnas ( or these constitute the essence of 
dharma ). And these have to be acquired most of all by the 
ascetic, since the outward signs, viz. the scanty clothing, the 
water jar &c. are not the real means of discharging the real 
duties of sannySsa, as anyone oan possess these outward signs. 
Vide Manu VI. 66, 92-94, Yfij. III. 65-66, Vas. X. 30, Baud. Dh. 
S. II. 10 55-56, Santi. 111. 13-14, Vftyupurana vol. I. 8. 176-178 
(ten characteristics, five called vratas and fire upavratas ). 

(22) He should endeavour (o purify his mind by pifiofi- 
yama and other practices of yoga and thereby enable himself 
gradually to realize the Absolute and secure final release 
( Manu VI. 70-75, 81, Yfij. III. 62, 64 ). 

In many works ascetios are divided into four classes. 
The Mababharata ( Anusasana 141. 89) says that ascetics are 



Ch. JtXVIlI ) tiannycisins-kinda of 9$9 

of four sorts, kutloaka, bahudaka, haihsa and paramahariisa, 
each later one being superior to each preceding one. 8 "** Vaik. 
VIII. 9, Laghu-Visnu IV. 14-23, Sufcasarhhita (MSnayogakhanda 
chap. 6), Bhiksukopanisad, Prajapati (quoted by Apsrarka p. 952) 
define these four. They do not all agree. The kutlcaka, as the 
name itself implies, is one who resorts to sannyasa in his own 
house or in a but erected by his sons, begs food of his sons and 
relatives, wears the top-knot, the sacred thread, has the three staffs, 
carries a water-jar and sfays in the same hut. The description 
of these four contained in Vaik., 8lw being probably among the 
oldest available, is set out here. The kutfcakas stay in the 
hermitages of sages like Gautama, Bharadvaja, Yajnavalkya 
and Harlta, take eight morsels of food every day, know the 
essence of the path of Yoga and hanker only after moksa (release). 
The bahudakas have three staffs, the water-jar and wear garments 
dyed with ochre, beg for food at seven houses of sage-like 
brahmanas or other well-conduoted men but avoid taking flesh, 
salt and stale food. The harhsas stay not more than one night 
in a village and not more than five nights in a town for alms or 
subsist on cow's urine or dung, or fast for a month or always 
perform the candrayana penance. Pitamaha quoted in Sm. M. 
( varnasrama p. 184 ) states that the harhsas carry only one 
danda, enter a village only for alms and otherwise stay under a 
tree or in a cave or on a river bank. 

The Paramahathsas always stay under a tree or in an unin- 
habited house or in a burial place and either wear a garment or 
are naked; they are beyond the pairs of dharma and adharma, 
truth and falsehood, purity and impurity. They treat all alike, 
they regard all as the Self, to them a clod of earth or gold is the 
same and they beg alms from persons of all varnas. The des- 
cription in the Bhiksukopanisad is almost in the same words

and also contains the words of the Jsb&lopanisad as to Parama- 
hathsas. It appears that long before the Ap. Dh. S. ( II. 9. 21. 
13-17 ) i. e. at least five or six centuries before Christ there 
were people who thought that an ascetic was beyond all vidhi 
( injunctions to do a thing ) and nisedha ( prohibition ), that he 
was above the ordinary rules about truthfulness or falsehood, 
that he should not care for pleasure or pain or for the study of 
the Vedas, or for this world or the next, he should simply seek 
to realize the Self, that when he realizes the Self all his sins, if 
any, would be liquidated thereby. Ap. combats these ideas by 
saying that such sentiments were opposed to the s&stras laying 
down rules about ascetics, that by realizing the Self, he cannot 
be free from the effects of what he does or the consequences of 
having a body. The sentiments which Ap. controverts arose 
from such passages as the one 11 " in the ;Br. Up. IV. 4. 23 'This 
is the eternal greatness of the man who realizes brahma that by 
the actions he does, he does not add to it or detract from it. 
Therefore one should only know the real nature of that great- 
ness ; he on knowing brahma is not affeoted by an evil action. ' 
In the Kausltaki Br. Up. III. 1 it is staled 81 " 'whoever 
realizes One ( the Supreme Spirit ), his worlds ( i. e. his position ) 
are not destroyed by any action of his, not even if he kills 
his parents, not even by theft nor by the murder of a learned 
brahmana. ' These words are not to be taken literally, they 
are merely a boastful utterance ( a praudhivSda ), they are 
really laudatory statements emphasizing the supreme value of 
the realization of brahman. Similarly the Chan. Up. IV. 14. 3 
says ' just as water does not stick to a lotus-leaf, so sinful 
actions do not cling to him who knows this '. In the same 
Upanisad ( V. 2. 1 ) we read ' to him who knows this, nothing 
becomes unfit as food. ' The Upanisads, however, generally 
lay great stress on moral virtues and emphasize that a high 
moral life is absolutely necessary for the seeker after spiritual 
truth. Vide Br. Up. IV. 4. 23, Chan. Up. III. 14. 1, Ka^ha Up.

I. 2. 23, 1. 3. 8-9 and 12. The position of the VedsntasStra ( in 
III. 4.27-31 ) is thai; the seeker after eternal truth must be 
endowed with restraint of senses and quiescence of mind and he 
cannot aot just as he pleases ( SabdaScatoSkamakaro ) and spurn 
all rules of morality. Sarhkaracarya on Vedanta-stltra II. 3. 48 
and other places makes this position perfectly clear. Visva- 
rupa on Yaj. III. 66 states that even ascetios of the parama- 
harhsa type are not allowed ( by Yaj. and other sages ) to behave 
as they please. Tbe Par. M. ( I. part 2, pp. 172-176 ) says that 
the paramabarhsa should have only one danda and argues that 
paramahamsas are of two kinds viz. vidvat ( those who have 
already realized brahman ) and vividisu ( those who are eager 
seekers after realization ) and relies on Br. Up. III. 5. 1 for the 
former and Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 and Jabalopanisad for the latter. 
YajQavalkya is an example of vidvat-sannyaaa, which leads to 
jivanmukti ( i. e. release even when the body still persists ), 
while the latter ( vividisS-sannyasa ) leads to release after the 
body is no more ( i. e. videha-mukti ). Vide JIvan-muktivi- 
veka p. 4 ff. 

The Jabalopanisad 8156 (6) describes the state of parama- 
hamsas at great length. Tbey are sages like Sarhvartaka, Aru- 
ni, Svetaketu, Durvasas, Rbhu, Nidagha, Jadabharata, 
Dattatreya, Raivataka ; they do not exhibit any visible signs 
of their order or any visible rules of conduct ; though they are 
really not mad they behave like one mad ; they go out for alms 
only for keeping body and soul together ; they are unaffected 
by acquisition or absence ( of alms ), they have no house but 
wander about and stay in a temple or on a heap of grass, on an 
ant-hill, or at the foot of a tree or on a river bank or in a cave, 
they have attachment for nothing, they are centred in 
contemplation of the One Spirit. According to Sutasihhita

( II. 6. 3-10 ) it is only hamsa and paramaharhaa that give up 
SikhS and the sacred thread. 

The Sannyasopanisad (13) adds two more varieties to the 
four enumerated above viz. ' turlyStlta ' and ' avadhuta * and 
defines them as follows : ' turly&tlta ' (one who is beyond the 
4th stage viz. of pararaahamsa ) eats only fruits in the way 
cows take food ( i. e. he does not hold them in his hands ), if he 
takes cooked food then only from three houses, he wears no 
cloth, his body only continues to live ( but he is not conscious 
of that fact ), he deals with his body as if it were dead. The 
avadhuta is beyond all restrictions, he takes food from all 
varnas except those who are charged with mortal sins or are 
patita ( outcasts ) and eats like an ajagara ( a boa constrictor ) 
i. e. lying down and opening only his mouth without any effort 
and is solely absorbed in the contemplation of the real 
nature of the Spirit. Medhatithi ,,,T ( on Manu VI. 33 ) is quite 
emphatio that sannySsa does not consist in defying all the 
rules of sfistra, but in giving up the sentiment of egoism and of 
possessiveness and that it is not true to say that for the sannyfi- 
sin all rules ( even of morality ) are non-existent. 

One important question on whioh opinion was sharply 
divided is whether sannySsa was allowed to all the three varnas 
or only to brShmanas. Those who held that it was allowed 
only to brShmanas argued as follows : In the Br. 8IM Up. IV. 4. 
22 we find the words ' this Self brShmanas seek to know by the 
study of the Veda ' ; similarly Br. Up. III. 5. 1 states ' after 
knowing this Self, brShmanas give up the hankering after 
progeny, wealth and heavenly worlds and practise begging ' 
and Mundaka I. 2. 12 ' closely examining the worlds that are 
the rewards of actions, a brShmana should oome to be disgusted 
&o.'. Here, the word ' brShmana ' being used, iruti indioates 
that brShmanas alone can be sannySsins. Manu ( VI. 38 )

begins his description of the 4th stage with the words ' a 
brahmana should leave his house and go into the world as a 
wanderer ' and winds up the chapter ( VI. 97 ) by saying ' I 
have declared this fourfold procedure in relation to brfihmanas '. 
Laghu-Visnu V. 13 emphatically states that the ascetic order is 
meant only for brahmanas and the other three asramas are 
meant for all dvijas. Those who assert that all the regenerate 
classes can resort to sannyasa hold that the word ' brahmana ' 
in the upanisads is used only as illustrative ( upalakqana ) and 
not in an exclusive sense and that a Sutrakara ( Katyayana ) 
expressly says 81W ' the three varnas after studying the Veda 
can pass through four asramas '. The Jabalopanisad (4) ordains 
' whether a man has fulfilled his vratas or not, whether he has 
performed samavartana ( the ceremonial bath after studying 
Veda ) or not, whether his fires ( Vedio ) have ceased or not he 
should resort to the wandering ascetic's life the very day on which 
he feels disgust with mundane affairs '. 816 ° It thus allows even a 
brahmacarl to become an ascetic ; a ksatriya and vaisya could 
be a brahmacarl. Yaj. III. 32 states that sannyasa is a means 
of purification ( of the mind ) in the case of twice-born olasses. 
Besides the only condition precedent mentioned by the Jaba- 
lopanisad for resorting to pravrajy a ( ascetic life ) is vairagya 
and whoever feels the latter is authorized to betake himself to 
that stage. Yaj. III. 61 while laying down the observances of 
ascetics employs the word ' dvijah * and not ' br&hmanah '. The 
Kurma-purana also says (Uttarardha 28. 2 ) that a dvija should 
become an ascetic. 

Both these opposing views are supported by the most 
famous authors. The first view that only brahmanas can be 
sannyasins is affirmed by the great Sarhkaracarya in his bhasya 
on Br. Up. III. 5. 1 and IV. 5. 15, It is most interesting and also

bhasya on Br. Up. III. 5. 1 first explains the views of bis guru, 
then enters the lists against bis great master and combats bis 
views with cogent arguments. Most of the medieval writers 
and works suob as Medhatithi on Manu ( VI. 97 ), the Mit., the 
Madanaparijafca ( pp. 365-373 ), the Smrfcimuktaphala ( Varna- 
srama p. 176 ) uphold the view that only brShmanas oan resort 
to the 4th asrama, while a few works like the Smrtioandrika 
( I. p. 65 ) support the second view. The position of Visva- 
rupa >UB ( on Yaj. III. 61 ) that only brahmanas oan resort to 
sannyasa causes great perplexity. Suresvara and Visvarupa 
are generally regarded as identical (vide H. D. vol. I. 
pp. 261-263 and Journal of the Andhra Historical Society for 
1931, vol. V, p. 187 ). But Suresvara holds the view that the 
word brahraana in the relevant texts is only illustrative. 
Therefore it follows that either Suresvara changes his views 
or that Suresvara and Visvarupa are not identical. Ananda- 
giri in his commentary on Suresvara's Vartika ( p. 759 ) cites 
passages from the Mahabharata ( Adi. 119) to establish that 
ksatriyas could resort to sannyasa. ,IM Santiparva (63. 
16-21 ) allows sannyasa to kings when their life is about to 
end. But the general words of Santi 62. 2 appear to be in confliot 
with this.'" 4 Kalidasa states that Raghu became a yati when 
he grew old, installed his son on the throne and stayed in a 
cottage outside the capital and draws a very poetio and striking 
picture of the contrast between the old king turned ascetic and 
the prince become king ( Baghu-vamsa VIII. 14 and 16 ). 

So far as the smrti texts and the medieval works are con- 
cerned a sudra could not become a sannyasin. The Santiparva 
( 63. 11-14 ) is quite dear that a sudra cannot be a bhiksu. It 
also ( 18. 32 )*"* informs us that in its day many ( probably

inoludlng sQdras) assumed the outward signs of the 4th asrama, 
got their heads tonsured and moved about in oohre-ooloured 
garments ( k&s&ya ) for securing alms and gifts. But there are 
clear indications that sudras did assume even in the times of 
anoient smrtis the ascetic's garb and mode of life. The Visnu 
Dh. S. V. 115 and Yaj. II. 241 ( as read by Visvarupa ) prescribe 
the fine of one hundred paws for one who gave a dinner to sadra 
ascetics in rites for gods and the manes. When the Asrama- 
vasika-parva 26. 33 states that Vidura was buried as an ascetic, 
the commentator Nllakantha remarks that this indicates that 
even sudras can follow the mode of the ascetic life. 81 "* 

It appears that even women oould in rare cases adopt the 
ascetic's life in ancient brahmanio times. The Mit. on Yaj. 

III. 58 quotes a sutra of Baud. ( sfcrlnam caike ) to the effect that 
according to some acaryas even women could adopt the ascetic 
mode of life. Patanjali in his Mahabhasya (vol. II. p. 100) 
speaks of a woman ascetic ( parivrajika ) named Sankara. Yama 
quoted in the Sm. 0. ( on vyavahara p. 254 ) declares ' neither in 
the Vedaa nor in the dharmasastras is pravrajyS enjoined for 
women ; ( procreation and care of ) progeny from a male of the 
same varna as herself is her proper dltarma, this is the establish- 
ed rule.* 8,6S The Sra. 0. gives in a far-fetched way absence of 
sexual intercourse as the meaning of pravrajya hero. Atri (136- 
137 ) lays down that six actions by women and sudras lead to 
sinfulness viz. japa, tapas ( austerities ), pravrajya ( asoetic's 
life), pilgrimages, endeavour to secure miraculous power by 
repeating spells, sole devotion to the worship of a goddess. 8 " 7 
In the drama called Malavikagnimitra Kalidasa describes the 
Pandita KausikI as wearing the garb of an ascetic (in I. 14). 
It must be said that the general trend of Hinduism is against 
women adopting the homeless or ascetic life. The Jatakas (e. g. 

IV. 392) rarely speak of candalas as adopting the homeless 
condition.

946 History of DharmaiMra [ Ch. XXVIII 

When "the question is asked whether sfldras or women could 
resort to sannyasa there is likely to be some confusion. The 
word ' sannyasa ' conveys two ideas : abandonment of all actions 
( kamya karma ) that spring from the desire to seoure some 
object or other and secondly, following a certain mode of life 
( asrama ) the outward signs of whioh are carrying a staff and 
the like and the entrance into which is preceded by the utterande 
of the praisa. The Jlvan-muktiviveka" 18 (p. 3) states thafc 
moksa ( amrtatva ) depends upon tyaga ( abandonment ) as stated 
in the Kaivalyopanisad (2) ' not by aotions, nor by progeny nor 
by wealth, but by tyaga some attained mok§a ' ( release )• 
For such abandonment even women and sodras are eligible! 
the best example of a woman giving up everything being 
that of Maitreyl, the wife of Yajfiavalkya, who plainly 
told the sage ( Br. Up. IV. 5. 3-4 ), ' what have I to do with 
that which will not make me immortal ( will not release me 
from samara ) ? ' The Bhagavad-glta ( 18. 2 ) also deolares 
that sannyasa means the giving up of actions springing from 
desires (to seoure oertain objects). The Jlvan-muktiviveka 
further states that by resorting to the asrama of sannyasa 
the mother and the wife of a sannyasin are supposed not to be 
born again as women ( but they may be born as men ). So 
women and sQdras may abandon all actions, though they 
could not adopt the peculiar ascetio mode of life with its out- 
ward symbols. According to Srlkara's bhfisya on Vedantasutra 
I. 3. 34 the order of sannyasa, the peouliar rules of which are 
reoommended by Vedio texts, is only for the three vainas, while 
mere nySsa ( abandonment of worldly pleasures and desires ) 
can be resorted to by women, sudras and mixed castes. 11 " 

Some espoused the view that sannyUsa was meant only for 
the blind, the cripple and the impotent, that is, for persons who 
possessed no eligibility ( adhikara ) for the performance of

Vedio rites. 6amkaracarya in his bhasya on V. S. III. 4. 20 
refutes the view that the passage of the Jabalopanisad (4) cited 
above relates to those who are not eligible for performing 
Vedio rites and establishes that that passage has in view 
the general prescription that there is a stage of life called 
parivrajya ( pannyasa ) meant for all that seek release from 
sam&ara. Suresvara in his Vfirtika on Samkara's Br. Up. bhasya 
( p. 1908 v. 1144 ) also refutes the view." 70 Medhatithi on 
Manu VL 36 rejects this view ( of some ) by saying that the 
blind or oripple cannot follow the rules and practices ( such as 
not staying in one village for more than one night ) just as 
they cannot perform Vedio rites and hence it could not have 
been intended by the srarfci writers that sannyasa was only for 
the blind and the oripple, nor can the impotent take to sannyasa 
as no upanayana is performed in their case. The Mit. on Yaj. 
III. 56 follows Medhatithi. The Sm. Mu. ( p. 173 ) and Yati-dh- 
( pp. 5-6 ) quote verses to the effeot that * the son of an apostate 
from sannyasa, one having bad nails or blaok teeth, one emaciated 
by phthisis, one devoid of a limb-these do not deserve to resort to 
sannyasa. Similarly those who are guilty of mortal sins or are 
suspected of them or are vratyas, those who have left the path of 
truth, purity, sacrifices, vratas, tapas, charity, study of the Veda 
and homa should not be allowed to take up the ascetic life '. 

One of the principal rules for a yati was that he was to 
leave wife and home and never to think of sexual matters or to 
revert to the life of a house-holder. Atri 8,T1 ( VIII. 16 and 
18 ) deolares ' I see no penance ( expiation ) for that twice-born 
man, who, after having resorted to the duties of a celibate 
( sannyasin ), falls off from that stage ; he is neither a dvija 
nor a sudra, his ohildren become candalas called Vidura '. 
Samkara on V.S. ( IIL 4. 42 ) explains that these words are only 
intended to emphasize the great effort required to remain celi- 
bate as a sannyisin and that expiations are as a matter of fact 
prescribed for &>bhiksu having sexual intercourse. Daksa VII. 
33 requires the king to brand on the forehead with the mark of

dog's foot and banish from the kingdom a person who after 
becoming a sannyasin does not abide by its rules ( of celibacy 
&c. ). It has been seen above that a man who falls away from 
the order of sannyasins became a slave of the king for life ( p. 
185). Atri requires a sannyasin not to stay even for a day in 
the place where live his father and mother, brother and sister, 
wife or son or daughter-in-law, his agnates or cognates or 
friends, or his daughter or her sons ( Sm. Mu. p. 206 ). 

Originally these injunctions about oomplete restraint and 
abandonment of sexual life and total lack of property were 
faithfully followed by ascetics. The great acarya Samkara was 
a celibate all his life, but he is said to have established four 
mathas&B stated above(p. 907) for the propagation of his doctrines 
and philosophy at Srngapura (modern Srngerl) and other plaoes. 
Pious devotees bestowed considerable donations on these mathas. 
In course of time these mathas went on increasing and huge 
properties came to be under the control of the pontiffs of these 
several mathas. There arose ten orders of advaita sannyasins 
alone tm viz. tlrtha, Ssrama, vana, aranya, giri, parvata, 
sagara, sarasvatl, bharatl and purl. These ten orders are said 
to be the pupils in succession of the four disciples of Samkara 
i. e. the first two of Padmapada, the next two of Hastamalaka, 
the next three of Trotaka ( or Totaka) and the last three of Sures - 
vara. The several mathas at Srngerl, KaficI, Kumbbakonam, 
Kudalgi, Sankesvara, Sivaganga have been quarrelling among 
themselves as to their jurisdictions* 178 and their rights 
to claim monetary payments from the people and to exercise 
spiritual authority in matters of expiations, excommunication 
&o. To support the olairas of the various mathas pedigrees of

teachers 8m and pupils appear to have been fabricated, no two 
of which agree in toto and in some of them Suresvara is said to 
have lived for 700 or 800 years. The disciples of Ramanuja 
and Madhva also have many mathas of their own. Vallabha- 
carya ( one of the great acaryas that interpreted the Vedanta- 
sutras ) and his disciples do not accept the order of sannySsa. 
Aocoiding to them in the Kali age sannyasa is forbidden for 
the seeker as it leads on to regret and worry tm " ( if its rules 
are to be strictly^observed) and that the parityaga (abandonment) 
that is the essenoe of sannyasa does not consist in resorting to 
the 4th asrama but in behaving in the way in which bhaktas 
( devotees) like Uddhava acted ( vide Bhagavata III. 4 ). Most 
of these mathas have large endowments or incomes which are 
spent in pomp and show ( e. g. keeping golden images and 
paraphernalia ). Very few of the heads are really learned even 
in ancient Sanskrit Literature in all its branches, they are 
impervious to modern tendencies and requirements, are obscu- 
rantists and generally oppose all ideas of reform. Only a very 
few mathas are presided over by persons "who have been celibate 
throughout their lives. Most of them originally were house- 
holders and then took to sannyasa. Besides the succession to 
the gadi is often a hole and corner affair. When the incumbent 
is about to die the influential and intriguing persons round him 
catch hold of some aspiring householder, make him a disoiple of 
the dying sannyasin and afterwards he is installed as the pontiff.

He retains his attachment to his former family and uses a good 
deal of the income for his relatives and friends. Real reform of 
the mathas oannot oome unless great improvements are made in 
selecting a suocessor. There must be several disciples, the 
selection must not be made on the incumbent's death-bed, 
representative bodies must have a voice in the selection. The 
heads of ascetic mathas bave often oome to the courts on ques- 
tions about dignity, jurisdiction and properties. For example, 
in 3 Moore's Indian Appeals p. 198 the Srngerl Pontiff claimed 
a declaration that he alone was entitled to proceed on the publio 
road in a palanquin crosswise and for an injunction restraining 
the Swami of the Lingayats from doing so ; in Madhusudan 
Parvat y. Shree Madhav Teertha, 33 Bom. 278, the Samkaracarya 
of the Sarada ma^ha at Dwarka sued for a declaration that tbe 
defendant was not entitled to tbe title and dignities of a 
Samkaracarya and that he was not entitled to call for or receive 
any offerings from people at Ahmedabad or other places in 
Gujarat either in bis assumed capacity of a Samkaraoarya or as 
a Samkaracarya of the Jyotir-ma^ha ( this olaim was also 
rejeoted on the grounds that the suit was not of a civil nature 
and that the offerings were voluntary ). 

In Vidua Shankara v. Vidya Narsimha, 51 Bom. 442 
( P. 0. ) the Privy Council had to deal with a pretty tangle of 
claims between four persons, the plaintiff and the defendant 
each claiming to be the lawful Samkaraoarya of Sankesbwar and 
Karvir matha and both having selected a disciple to succeed 
them. -These illustrations indicate how the world-renouncing 
ideal of oonduot set forth by the great Samkaracarya is honoured 
in modern times by those who swear by his name. They should 
lay to heart the words of the Jlvanmuktiviveka and the quota- 
tion in it from Medhatithi ( pp. 158-159 ) "" viz. * if an ascetio 
seoures a matha as a fixed plaoe of residenoe and thereon a 
sentiment of ownership arises in him his mind will be disturbed 
when loss or expansion of the matha takes plaoe ; therefore an 
ascetio should not possess a matha nor should he have vessels 
of gold or silver for his use nor should he gather pupils round

himself for securing service from them or in order that they 
may honour him, spread his fame, or bring money to him, but 
he may gather disciples only for removing their ignoranoe. * 

In J. R. A. S. for 1925 pp. 479-486 Dr. J. N. Farquhar 
contributes a very learned article on the organization of the 
sannyasins of the Vedanta. Therein he shows how Moslem 
armed fakirs molested and even killed Hindu ascetios, how 
Madhusudana SarasvatI approached the Emperor AJcbar, how 
failing to get complete redress he initiated ksatriyas and 
vaisyas into seven out of the ten orders of sannyasins and 
armed them, how these sannyasins fought against the moslem 
fakirs and also among themselves, how even non-brahmin 
women are initiated into the giri and puri orders and how in 
Northern India the pure monastic orders are those of tlrtha, 
asrama and sarasvatl. This innovation later on led to serious 
consequences. The sannyasins and fakirs infested the province 
of Bengal and their inoursions and depredations caused great 
alarm in the first days of tha British rule ( latter half of the 
18th century tm ). This shows how the rule of ahimsU, enjoined 
upon asoetios became perverted. Various estimates have been 
made about the number of persons in India professing to lead 
the ascetic life. They could easily have been 10 per oent of the 
population, particularly in Northern India. They generally 
led very indolent, parasitic and dissolute lives. There are 
however, reasons to believe that in recent times the number of 
go-called sannyasins is being substantially reduoed owing to 
several causes. There have been swarms of monks and nuns 
in Christian countries also. Before the suppression of the 
monasteries by Henry VIII in England about 400 years ago, the 
number of monks, nuns and persons dependent on them was 
enormously large. Vide ' English monks ' by Geoffrey Basker- 
ville, p. 285, ( f. n. 2 ) where the figures of monks and nuns 
in England, France and Spain at various periods are given. 

Aooording to both anoient and modern Hindu Law, when a 
man beoame a sannyasin, he became cut off from his family and 
lost all his rights to property, partition and inheritance in 
that family. Vas. Dh. S. 17. 52 lays down that those who resort 
to another asrama ( i. e. vanaprastha or sannyasa ) are excluded 

2176. Vide ' Sannyasi and Fakir raidera in Bengal ' by Bai Saheb 
Jamini Mohan Ghosh ( 1930 ) for a detailed and interesting account.

from their share (in the family property). 8177 This result, 
however, does not follow hy merely wearing the garments of a 
sannyasin, but in order that this result may follow a person 
must have performed the necessary ceremonies for entering the 
order of sannyasins. On the other hand whatever belongs to a 
sanny&sin such as his clothes, his sandals, his books would not 
devolve on his blood relations as heirs but will go to his 
spiritual heir ( viz. his pupil ). Vide Y&j. II. 137 and the Mit. 
thereon. These rules, however, do not apply to a sudra turning 
an ascetic. He does not become severed from his family by 
entering the order of asoetioism, unless a usage to that effect is 
established. Vide Somasundaram v. Vaithilinga, 40 Mad. 846 
( at p. 869 ), Harishchandra v. Atir Muhmud, 40 Gal. 545. 

The most serious inroad, however, on the ideal of sannyasa 
was made when people professing to be ascetics were allowed 
to have wives or concubines. The Vayupurana ( quoted in the 
Yati-dharmasangraha p. 108 ) invokes dire consequenoes on him 
who after becoming a sannyasin has sexual intercourse, viz. he 
beoomes a worm in ordure for 60,000 years, passes through the 
lives of a rat, a vulture, a dog, a donkey, a pig, a tree without 
flowers and fruit, a goblin and then he is born as a candala. 
The Rajataranginl ( III. 12 ) records*' 7 ' that when the queen of 
Meghavahana built a monastery she established in a portion of 
it ascetics who followed the rules of conduct laid down for 
their order and in the other portion asoetics, who were oondemn- 
able because of their acting like householders, together with 
their wives, sons, cattle and wealth. In the Presidenoy of 
Bombay several oases have come before the oourts about the 
rights of succession to Gharbhari Gosavis 817 ' ( i. e. ascetics who 
have a house and family ). Vide Gomin Rarribharti v. Mahant 
Surajbharti, 5 Bom. 682 ( where it was held that a Gosavi who 
succeeded as a disoiple to a mohunt did not forfeit his rights 
by subsequent marriage ), Balgir v. Dhondgir, 5 Bom. L. B. 114,

Ch. XXVIII 1 BannyUaa 953 

In the Gupta Inscriptions we have several records of a line of 
kings who were the feudatories of the imperial Guptas and who 
bear the appellation 'nrpati-parivrajaka' (kingly ascetics). Fleet 
thinks ( p. 95 n. 1 ) that the word means no more than what is 
oonveyed by suoh words as ' rajarsi ', but this is unconvincing. 
Their gotra was Bharadvaja and the founder is said to have 
been an incarnation of Eapila ( p. 115 ). It is likely that the 
founder, after being a king, ultimately became a sannyasin 
and his descendants ( in the fashion poetically described by 
Kalidasa ) also became ascetics after adorning the throne for 
some time. Hence they probably came to be called nrpati-pari- 
vrajakas. It is interesting to note that Vyasa quoted in Sm. M. 
( p. 176 ) and Yati-dh. (pp 2-3) forbade sannyasa in the Kali age , 
though he made an exception to this extent that as long as the 
division of society into varnas existed and as long as the Veda 
was studied so long sannyasa could be resorted to in the Kali 
age. ,,8 ° NSgesa in his VratyatSprayagcitta-nirnaya (p. 46 ) 
makes the curious statement that according to the Sannyasa- 
paddhati of Vyasa a wise brahmana should not resort to 
sannyasa when 4400 years of the Kali age will have expired 
(ie. after 1299 A. D.). 8181 This diotum was probably due 
not only to the difficulties of observing to the letter the oode of 
life sketched for sannyasina, but also to the fact that about 
1299, the whole of India was being harassed by Moslem inva- 
ders and adventurers who made the helpless sannyasins the 
first target for their fanatio zeal and persecution. The Nirnaya- 
sindhu ( III, purvardha, end ) quotes the above verse of Vyftsa 
and remarks that this prohibition of sannyasa is meant to 
apply to sannyasa with three dandas. 

The Baud. Dh. S. II. 10. 11-30, the Baud. gr. sesasatra IV. 
16, the Vaik. IX. 6-8 contain the procedure of becoming a 
sannyasin. That of the Baud. Dh. S. being probably the most

After haying out the hair on the head, the beard, the hair on the 
body, the nails, he makes ready three sticks, a loop of strings, 
(a pieoe of oloth as) a water strainer, a jar and a bowl. 
Having taken these he should go to the end of his village, or 
to the extremity of the boundary of his village, or the fire- 
hall ; he should partake of clarified butter, milk and curds 
( mixed together ) and should fast or drink water. Then he should 
reoite the vyahrtis separately preoeded by ' om ' and followed 
by the words ' I enter the Savitrl ' and by one pada of the 
sacred G&yatrl and then all together. 8188 Before sunset, he 
heaps fuel on the garhapatya fire ( if he has maintained Vedic 
fires ), brings the anvahSryapacana ( daksin&gni ) to the spot, 
takes the flaming ahavanlya fire out of the garhapatya, 
melts clarified butter on the garhapatya, cleanses it (with 
blades of kusa), takes four portions of the butter in the spoon 
called 'sruc' and offers in the Shavanlya fire on which fuel-sticks 
have been heaped a full oblation ( i. e. whole spoonful ) four 
times saying 'om svaha'. This is called Brahmanvadhana 
( putting fuel-sticks on fire for securing knowledge of brahman ). 
Then in the evening after agnihotra has been offered, he strews 
grass to the north of the garhapatya fire, plaoes on the grass 
sacrifioial vessels in pairs with the upper parts turned downwards, 
spreads darbha grass to the south of the ahavanlya fire on the 
seat meant for the brahma priest, covers it with blaok antelope 
skin and remains awake the whole of that night. Then he rises 
at the time ( muhurta ) sacred to Brahma and offers agnihotra 
in the early morning at the proper time. Then after covering 
the part of the altar called prs^hyft and bringing water he 
prepares an offering for Agni Vaisvanara cooked on twelve pot- 
sherds. That well-known is^i will be the last he will perform. 
Afterwards, he throws in the ahavanlya fire those sacrificial 
vessels wbioh are not made of stone or earth. And throwing the 
two aranis (the wooden logs by the friction of which fire was

all worldly ties, contempt of the world and all earthly riobes, a life of 
alums! and contemplation on and realization of the Absolute Brahman.

few repetitions and some matters that have already been dealt with.

produced for vedio rites ) into the garhapatya fire with the words 
' may you two be of one mind with us ' he ( mentally ) 
deposits the three fires in himself. Repeating the mantra ' yft 
te agne yajfiiya tanur ' ( Tai. 8. III. 4. 10. 5 ) he inhales the 
smell of the smoke of eaoh of the three fires thrice. Then 
standing within the sacrificial enclosure he says thrice in a low 
voice and thrice aloud the words * om bhuh, bhuvab svah. I 
have entered the order of sannyasa ( lit. I have abandoned ), I 
hare entered the order of sannyasa, I hare entered the order of 
sannyasa '. Lastly he pours out as much water as will fill his 
joined hands saying * I promise that no injury will proceed 
from me to any creature '. He must henceforward restrain his 
speeoh. He holds his staff saying ' thou art my friend, proteot 
me*. He takes the iikya (loop of strings) with the words 
' yadasya pare rajasah * ( Tai. S. IV. 2. 5. 2 ) ; he takes the oloth 
for straining water with the text ' yena devah pavitrena * ( Tai. 
Br. 1. 4.8 and Nirukta V.6); he takes the water jar reoiting 'yena 
deva jyotisordhvam* (Tai. S. V. 7. 2. 2); he takes the bowl 
after reoiting the seven vyahrtis. Taking with him the 
staffs, the loop of strings, the cloth as a water strainer, the 
water-pot and the bowl he goes to a place where water can 
be had, bathes, sips water and sprinkles himself ( performs 
marjana ) with the SurabhimatI 8,M verse ( dadhi-kravno, Bg. 
IV. 39. 6 ), with Ablinga verses, Varunl verses, Hiranyavarna 
verses (Tai. S. V. 6. 1. 1 = Atharvaveda I. 33. 1-4) and Pava- 
manl verses ( Bg. IX. 1 &e. ). While still in the water he 
performs sixteen pranayamas after ( mentally going over ) the 
Aghamarsana verses (Bg. X. 190. 1-3), comes out of the water on 
the bank, wrings his garments, puts on another pure ( washed ) 
garment, sips water, takes the oloth for straining water with 
the words ' om bhur bhuvab. svah ' and performs tarparux to the 
seven "" vyahrtis. He then fills his joined hands with water 
and performs tarpam to the Manes just in the same way as he 
did to the gods, then he worships the sun with the two verses 
* udu tyam * ( Bg. 1. 50. 1 ) and ' citram * ( Bg. L 115. 1 ). He 
then offers tarpam to the Atman ( self ) with * the syllable om is 
brahma', this light (the sun) that diffuses warmth is indeed

brabma; this which gives warmth is indeed the Veda; this 
indeed that sheds warmth is the ( proper ) objeot of knowledge ' ; 
then he worships the Atman with the words ' the Self is 
brahman, it is light '. Let him repeat the Gayatrl verse one 
thousand times or an unlimited number of times. Repeating 
' om bhfirbhuvah svah ' he takes up the water strainer ( cloth ) 
and fetohes water. Let him not thereafter perform Hcamana 
with water that has not been drawn up ( from a well ), which 
has not been strained 8188 and which has not been completely 
cleansed. Let him not wear thereafter whitegarments. He 
may carry one staff or three. He hag to keep the following 
vows : ahimsS ( abstaining from injury to any creature ), truth- 
fulness, not depriving others of any property of theirs, 
continence, and liberality. There are five minor vratas ( vows ) 
viz. absence of anger, waiting upon the guru, avoidance of care- 
lessness ( or rashness ), cleanliness, purity in food. Then follow 
rules as to begging for alms ( some of them are at pp. 933-934 
above ). When he returns from begging, he places the alms 
in a pure spot, washes his hands and feet and announces ( the 
alms ) first to the sun with the verses ' udu tyam * ( Bg. 1. 50. 1 ) 
and 'citram ' ( Rg. I. 115.1); he also announces the alms to 
brahman with the text ' brahma jajnanam ' ( Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 2 
= Atharvaveda IV. 1. 1 ). It is declared ( in Vedio texts ) that 
after the brahmadhana the sacred fires are contained in the 
sacrifioer himself ; his prana, apana, vyana, udana and samana 
represent the five fires garhapatya, anvahfiryapacana (daksi- 
nSgni ), ahavanlya, sabhya and avasathya. These five fires 
indeed abide in the Atman ; he, therefore, offers ( the oblations ) 
in the Atman only. This sacrifice offered in the soul, whioh is 
centred in and based on the Atman, leads the soul to bliss. 
Giving compassionately portions of the alms to oreatures and 
sprinkling the remainder with water, he should partake of it as 
if it were some medicine. After he has eaten and taken 
Soamana he worships the sun with the JyotismatI 2197 verse 
viz. ' ud vayam ' ( Rg. I. 50. 10 ) after inaudibly muttering the 

2186. Vide Manu VI. 46 for straining water. ' Liberality '—the 
aioetio has ex hypotheti no property, but his tytga may consist in imparting 
knowledge and giving his mss. or books to the needy.

two texts ' vfiii me Ssan ' ( Tai. S. V. 5. 9. 2 ) and ' nasoh pranah " 
(Tai. Ar. X. 72). Let him eat food given without asking, 
regarding which nothing has been settled beforehand and 
which comes to him by chance and so much only as is neces- 
sary to support life. 

Now they quote the following rules for the case where the 
teachers explain the Upanisad ' standing ( in the day ), keeping 
silence, sitting (at night) in the posture 8187 " of crossed legs, 
bathing thrice a day, he shall subsist entirely on rice grains, 
oil-cake, food from barley, sour milk and milk '. It is declared 
in Vedic texts ' on that occasion he shall keep strict silence and 
converse as much as is neoessary with the teachers deeply 
versed in the three vedas, with ascetics or other learned persons 
in the several Ssraraas, after pressing the teeth together, all the 
while contemplating on what he hears, but not in such a way 
as would cause a breach of his vow. He may keep only one of 
the rules out of the three viz. standing (in the day), rigid silence 
and sitting with crossed legs ( at night ) and not all together. 
Eight things do not cause him who is intent on vows as above to 
break his own vow viz. water, roots, clarified butter, milk, sacri- 
ficial food, the wish of a brahmana, an order of his guru, and 
medicine. Let him mutter the mantras in the evening and 
morning that are repeated in the Agnihotra. He should perform 
his evening sandhya adoration with mantras addressed to Varu- 
na 8188 and in the morning with those addressed to Mitra ( Rg. 
III. 59). It is declared in the Veda ' limited in number are the 
rk verses, the sUmans and the yajus formulae, but there is no limit 
to this that is brahma.' In this way (i. e. repeating om ) the ascetio 
may give up the rest of the Veda, but should stand firm by the 
root of the Veda (viz. om). The Veda is the tree and its root 
is pranava (om). He should meditate on 'om'. Prajapati 
has declared that pranava leads on to union with brahman. 
Let him cleanse the vessel of brahman with seven vyShrtis. 8,M

Among medieval works the Smrtyarthasara (pp. 96-97), 
the Sm. M. (pp. 177-182), the Yati-dh. (pp. 10-22), the 
Nirnaya-sindhu (III. Uttarardha pp. 628-632), the Dharma- 
sindhu give various detailed prooedures. Many of the medie- 
val works and manuals (paddhatis) on sanny&sa frequently 
refer to a work called Brahmanandl, which I have not been 
able to secure. The prooedure in the Dharmasindhu contains 
the following elements. Sannyasa is to be resorted to in the 
northward passage of the sun and for a man who is about to 
die even in the southward passage. He should find out a 
teacher possessed of the virtues of quiescence and note for three 
months the duties of ascetics in his company, should purify 
himself with japa of the saored Gayatrl, Rudra mantras and 
by Kusmanda homa (for which see Tai. Ar. II. 7 ). He should 
then make a sankalpa ,,M after reciting the place and time on 
a rikta tithi and should perform the prayascitta of catuhkrcchra 
by giving a cow or money for each as stated above (pp. 199-200). 
Then be should begin to perform on the 11th or 12th day 16 
sraddhas of himself and sapindlkarana. Then he is to perform 
eight sraddhas ( vide above p. 932 ) and tarpaya as a subordinate 
part ( anga ) of these eight sraddhas. On the day these eight 
sraddhas are performed or on the next day he should shave off 
the whole head after keeping six hairs out of his top-knot, pare 
his nails, then take his bath, then he is to donate to brfih- 
manas and his sons all his wealth except his wearing apparel 
and the materials for homa. The garments he is to wear should 
be dyed with red ohalk ; he should secure a bamboo staff as 
high as his head &o. and as thick as his finger and brought by 
a brahmana; that staff should be sprinkled over with water 
from a conch to the accompaniment of ' om ', the purusa hymn 
( Bg. X 90) and such names (of Visnu) as Kesava. He should 
also keep ready a water jar, a strip for his loins and a garment 
to cover his body and a wallet and padukas (sandals). He 
should declare his resolve (sankalpa) to become a parama- 
harhsa and perform the worship of Ganesa, punyahavSoana, 
worship of mother goddesses and Nandl-sraddha. He should 
then perform japa by saying ' namah ' to Brahma ( in the 
dative), Visnu, Eudra, Surya, Soma, Atman, Antaratman, 
Paramatman and also repeat the first padaa of eaoh of the four

Vedas. He should then eat three handfuls of barley flour with 
•ora' and touch his navel. He should then sip thrice olarified 
butter or water mixed with milk and curds repeating the 
mantras ' trivrd-asi \ * pravrd-asi ', 'vivrd-asi* (all three in 
Vaj. S. 15. 9 ) and then drink water with the mantra ' may the 
waters purify ' (Tai. Ar. 10. 23), then perform aoamana and 
declare his resolve to fast. Then comes Savitrlpravesa ( as in 
Baud, above); then he should kindle his grhya fire or if he 
has no grhya fire then he should bring domestio fire with the 
mantra 'prsfa divi' (Rg.VII. 5. 27) and kindle it with the 
three mantras 'tat savituh', 'tarn savituh' and ' visvani deva ' 
(Sg. III. 62. 10, Vaj. S- 17. 74, Rg. V. 82.5). Then comes 
brahmanvadhana before sunset (see above p. 954). He Bhould 
thereafter perform evening sandhya adoration, homa and 
vaisvadeva and keep awake the whole night near the fire. Then 
the next morning after the daily homa and Vaisvadeva he 
should offer a mess of cooked food to Agni or Vaisvanara and 
perform the homa to prSna and others, the purusasukta homa 
and Viraja homa. The Viraja homa is a lengthy performance 
and the prinoipal elements in it are : the offering of 40 oblations 
of each out of the three viz. fuel-stioks, boiled rice and clarified 
butter after repeating certain formulae such as ' may my five 
pranas be purified, may I be light ( illumination ) free from 
rajas ( the prinoiple of activity or obstruction ) and from evil, 
svaha ; this is for the prana and the rest, it is not mine.' In this 
way oblations are offered to five senses, the mind, buddhi, seed, 
thought and sankalpa, to the constituents of the body, to the 
several limbs of the body ( head, hands and feet &o. ), to purusa 
and others, to the five elements, to the five gunas of the elements, 
to the five kosas (sheaths) and several others. Then an oblation 
of ajya is made to Prajapati. Then he should recite the Purusa 
hymn ( Rg. X. 90 ) and the first sentenoes of the four Vedas, 
offer oblations to Agni Svistakrt, distribute gifts to students 
and others, he should burn his wooden utensils in his grhya 
fire if he has kept one and donate the metal vessels to his guru, 
then he should deposit the fire in himself by reciting ' ayam te 
yonih ' ( Rg. III. 29. 10 ) and ' ya te agne yajfiiya ' ( Tai. S. III. 
4. 10. 5 ) thrice and should face and take in the blaze and 
warmth of his grhya fire, should take a black antelope skin and 
leave his house. He should give blessings to his sons and other 
near relatives and bid good-bye to them with the words ' to me 
belongs no one nor do I belong to any one.' Then he should go to 
a reservoir of water, take in his folded hands water and offer it 



960 History of DharmaiSstra [ Ch. XXVIII 

to all gods with the hymn Rg. X. 103 (1-13). He should declare 
a resolve to resort to sannyasa for the realization of brahman 
and offer three handfuls of water in the reservoir. He should 
then discharge water into the reservoir from his joined hands 
saying ' I have given up the hankering for sons, wealth, worlds 
and for everything) may there be safety to all creatures from 
me, svaha.' Then he should again declare that he has abandoned 
everything, all pleasures, all sentiments of anger &c, all joys 
of flowers, scents, dancing and music, all duties of varna and 
Ssramas &c. ; he should also declare ' I shall not cause any 
injury to any creature in thought, word or by the body ; may 
all oreatures have no fear of me.' He should think of the sun 
and other gods as witnesses to this declaration and standing 
in navel-deep water should again perform the Savitrlpravesa 
and offer water in declaring ' I have risen beyond the desire for 
sons, worlds and wealth and shall practise begging.' 

After this comes the utterance of the prai§a ( the oall or 
direction ). In a low, moderate and loud voice the entrant 
should declare ' om, bhilh I have given up everything, om 

bhuvah, I have , om svah, I have , om bhur bhuvah 

svah, I have given up everything ' and should disoharge water 
in the reservoir of water with the words ' may there be no injury 
to all creatures from me, Bvaha.' He should pluck out the top- 
knot, take out his sacred thread and hold them in his hand and 
offer them in water with water with the words 'water is indeed all 
deities, I sacrifice ( the top-knot and sacred thread ) to all gods, 
svaha' and then he should send up a prayer to Vasudeva. Then 
he should remove his wearing apparel and walk five steps 
with his face to the north. Then the acarya should bow to the 
entrant and should hand over to the latter a piece of loin cloth 
and upper garment and a staff. The entrant should wear them 
and hold the staff with appropriate mantras and also a water 
jar and an asana ( a seat ). He should then hold a fuel-stick 
in his hand, bow to his guru, sit down in the eagle posture and 
make a request to the guru in the words 'Oh teaoher, who are like 
the Lord of the Universe to me, save me who am scorched by 
the fire of sarhsara and who am bitten by Death ; I have thrown

waited upon the guru with these words and placing his right knee 
on the ground, he should clasp the feet of his guru and should 
say ' teaob, Sir, brahma to me.' The guru should contemplate 
on bis soul as brahman, should recite over a conch full of water 
the sacred syllable ' om * twelve times, should pour the water 
from the oonch on bis disciple, should reoite the propitiatory 
verse * sam no mitrah ' ( Rg. I. 90. 9 ), then lay his hand on the 
head of the disciple, should recite the Purusa hymn (Rg. X. 90), 
should place his hand on the heart of the disciple and mutter 
the mantra 8 " 8 'I place thy heart in disciplined obedience to 
me,' the guru should then mutter in the right ear of the disciple 
the syllable ' om ' and should enlighten him about the signi- 
ficance of 'om' and of paftclkarana; 8 " 8 he should then impart to 
the disciple one of the four great Vedanta sentences ( mahavakya ) 
' prajnanam brahma' ( Ait. Up. III. 3 ), ' ay am-atma brahma' 
( Br. Up. II. 5. 19 ), * tat tvam-asi ' ( Chan. Up. VI. 8. 7 ), ' aham 
brahmasmi ' ( Br. Up. I. 4. 10) in acaordance with the tradition 
of his school and enlighten him about the meaning thereof. 
Then he should give to the disciple a name ending in tlrtha, 
asrama &o. according to the tradition of his order. Then the 
guru may bring about what is called paryankasauoa and give 
to the disciple the yogapatta. 

The paryanka-sauca ( purification by being seated on a stool 
&c. ) may be briefly described. On an auspicious day a house- 
holder seats the ascetic in front of him on a wooden stool or 
seat, places five heaps of earth to his left and also to his right 
and also pure water on both sides. Then the householder 
simultaneously washes the two knees of the ascetic with water 
and earth from the first heap of earth on the left. Then he 
should wash his own left hand with earth and water taken 
from the half of the first heap on the right and with the remain-

ing half of the first heap on the right he should wash both his 
hands seven times with the same water. With the seoond heap 
on the left he should wash simultaneously the two thighs 
( janghS ) of the asoetio four times and with one half of the 
seoond heap on the right he should wash his own left hand 
seven times and with the other half of the second heap ( on the 
right ) he should wash both bis hands four times. The ankle, the 
upper part of the foot and the lower park ( sole ) of the foot of 
the ascetio are respectively washed with the third, fourth and 
fifth heap on the left and his own left hand and both hands are 
washed a certain varying number of times with 3rd, 4th, 5th 
heaps on the right. 

The yogapafta ( lit. the cloth of yoga, union with Spirit ) 
is given in the following way : After the ascetic has under- 
gone paryankasauoa, he should cleanse his waist, wear a 
string round his waist and his loin cloth and cover his 
waist with a piece of oloth. He should then sit with his 
guru's permission on a high seat and should propound some 
VedSnta topic in the presenoe of the persons assembled. The 
asoetic guru should sprinkle on the head of his ascetio disciple 
water from a conch to the accompaniment of the Furusa hymn 
( Rg. X. 90 ), should honour him by offering clothes, sandalwood 
paste, flowers, incense, lamp and naivedya. He ( the guru ) 
should hold a piece of oloth over the head of the disoiple, reoite 
along with the other yatis the chapter called Visvarupa ( 11th 
chapter of the Bhagavadglta ) from the 15th verse to the 33rd 
verse. He should then give the name already determined upon 
to the disciple and say to him ' Henceforward you may admit to 
sarhnySsa one who is eligible for it, initiate him and give him the 
yogapa^ta.' Then the disciple bows to the yatis older than 
himself. Then the guru gives to the disoiple a waist-thread 
and a staff marked with five rmtdras and should offer his own 
salutation to the disoiple .aocording to the tradition of his 
order. Other ascetics and house-holders also should bow to 
the disciple, who should only repeat the word * Narayaoa,' 
should leave the high seat and seat his guru thereon, should 
bow to the guru according to the rules of the order and to the 
other ascetics. * IH

Oh. £XVIlt J SamnyUsa-for the dying 963 

The JabSlopanisad (5) sm allows samnyasa to those even 
who are suffering from disease and are about to die, all 
that is required being that they should deolare in words and 
resolve in their mind to enter the order of samnyasa. No exten- 
sive ceremonial is required. Angiras and Sumantu quoted in 
Sm. M. ( pp. 174 and 182 ) state ' when a man is shattered by 
old age or harassed by his enemies or is suffering from ( an 
incurable) disease he may resort to samnyasa by merely 
uttering the praisa ( vide above p. 960 ) and no further rites 
would be absolutely necessary. He should recite thrice in 
the morning, at noon and in the evening, ' I have given up 
everything (or entered upon samnyasa)* and further say 
* I forswear whatever aotion I may have done through ignorance, 
indolence or carelessness ; I shall cause no harm to creatures 
with my hands or feet, with my speech, body or mind ; may all 
creatures have no fear from me.' The Dharmasindhu ( III, 
uttar&rdha ) says that in this samnyasa for those at the door of 
death the absolutely essential elements are the resolve ( sarii- 
kalpa ), the uttering of the praisa and the giving of the promise 
of non-injury and the rest of the rites may or may not be 
performed according to circumstances. Even now such a 
samnyasa ( called aturasamnyasa ) is sometimes resorted to by 
religious-minded men in extremis, the only essentials gone 
through being safnkalpa (declaration of resolve), ksaura (tonsure 
of the head ), savitrlpravesa ( desoribed above at p. 954 ) and 
praisooo&ra ( utterance of praisa ). 

One question on whioh controversies have raged from 
very ancient times is whether an ascetio should give up his top- 
knot and sacred thread also. The Jabalopanisad tlH (5) states

that Atri asked Yajfiavalkya how a man who did not wear a 
yajfiopavlfca (when he became an ascetic) could still be a brah- 
mana and that the great sage replied that in the case of the 
ascetic the Self was his yajnopavlta and the same Upanisad (6) 
states that the paramabarhsa is to abandon in water the three 
dandas, the water-jar, the sikya, the begging bowl, the water- 
strainer, the topknot and yajnopavlta and should be a seeker 
after the Self. In the Arunika Up. (i) it is said "" that he 
should discharge his yajnopavlta on the earth or in water and 
that he should give up his sikha and the saored thread. Samkara 
in his bh&sya on Br. Up. III. 5. 1 sets out at some length the 
arguments and the authorities on both sides and ultimately 
gives it as his own view that the sacred thread and iikhU 
should be given up by the ascetic. VisvarGpa on Yaj. III. 66 
also discusses this matter and propounds the same view. On 
the other hand Vrddha-Harlta 8 " 8 VIII. 57 declares 'if an 
ascetio gives up the acts peculiar to brahmanas, viz. keeping a 
topknot and wearing a saored thread, he becomes a candala 
while alive and is born a dog after death. ' The Jlvanmukti- 
viveka ( p. 6 ff. ) and Far. M. I. part 2, p. 164 ff. discuss this 
point and arrive at the same conclusion as Samkara. The Mit. 
on Yaj. III. 58 gives an option. In modern times samnyasins 
give up these two. 

Some speoial rules are laid down about the ahvika ( daily 
rites ) of ascetics."" They have to perform sauca, brushing the 
teeth, bath,' just as house-holders have to do. Manu V. 137 
( a Vas. Dh. S. VI. 19, Visnu Dh. S. 60. 26, Sankha 16. 23-24 ) 
says that forest hermits and ascetics have respectively to per- 
form three and four times as much sauoa ( bodily purification ) 
as house-holders. As to food, it has already been seen (p. 935) that 
they are to eat only once and only eight morsels. Ascetics have 
to worship Purusottama ( i. e. Vasudeva with his four forms ), 
Vyfisa ( with his four pupils, Sumantu, Jaimini, Vaisampayana, 
Paila ), the Bhasyak&ra Samkara ( with his four pupils ) and so 
on. Certain rules are laid down for an asoetio as regards

giving and receiving honour or salutation. An ascetic should 
bow to gods and to older ascetics who aot according to the rules 
of their order, but should not offer namaskara to an house-holder 
even if the latter be well-conduoted. If another person bows to 
an ascetic, the latter should not pronounce any benediction but 
should only utter the word 8800 ' Narayana. ' When an ascetic 
( even one who has taken saihnyasa on his death-bed) dies, he is 
to be buried and not cremated. No mourning is to be observed 
for a yati when he dies ( Atri 97 ) and no sraddhas are 
to be offered on his death except the parvana on the 11th day 
after death ( vide Apararka p. 538 ). If an asoetio hears of the 
death of his son or any other relative, he does not become impure 
and has not to bathe but on hearing of bis mother's or father's 
death he has to bathe, though he observes no mourning' 800 * 

According to the theory of Dharmasastra, the king is not 
only the head of the oivil administration and the fountain of 
justice, but he is also the final controlling authority in preserv- 
ing religious and spiritual institutions, he is to see that people 
follow the dharma, to punish them for breaches of the religious 
and spiritual codes and to see to the administration to them of 
appropriate penances. In short, he is also the Defender of the 
Faith. Vide Gaut. XL 9-11, Vismi Dh. S. III. 2-3, Narada 
( praklrnaka ) verses 5-7, Yaj. I. 337 and 359, Atri 17-20, Manu 
VII. 13. But he regulated spiritual and religious matters not 
by his arbitrary authority but on the advice of his purohita and 
ministers and after taking the opinion of the assemblies 
(pariqad) of learned men. Whenever difficult questions arose 
about the validity of anything from the religious point of view 
or about penances for lapses, or about exoommunicating or 
outoasting a man the opinion of the assembly of learned men 
was sought. Therefore, detailed rules are laid down in the 
Dharmasutras and smrtis about the constitution. of pariqads. In 
modern times, the British Government being neutral in matters 
religious or ecclesiastical, the ascetic haads of the various ma^has 
have been in the* habit of assuming to themselves jurisdiction

over persons professing to follow their dogmas in ecclesiastical 
matters suoh as prescribing penances for lapses, settling disputes 
between castes, and deciding upon questions of outoasting. A 
few words must be said about the parisad* and about the claims 
of the SamkarficSryas ( the modern heads of ma^has ) to regulate 
religious matters affecting their followers. 

Among the oldest texts on this point is the one contained 
in the Tai. Up. 1. 11. viz. the exhortation of the teacher on the 
eve of the student's departure at the close of his studies." 01 ' If 
you have hereafter a doubt about any rite or about a oourse of 
conduct, you should behave in the way in which the brahmanas 
of -your place, who are thoughtful, intent (upon doing their duties), 
aot spontaneously ( without being urged by any one ), are not 
hard-hearted and have an eye only to dharma ( and not to Kama 
or arlha ) will behave. The same holds good about your conduct 
towards persons oharged (generally falsely) with sins or lapses'. 

The words ' sabha ' ( $g. X. 34. 6 ) and 'samiti' (Rg. X. 97.6) 
ooour even in the Rgveda but their exact significance is doubt- 
ful and the former word at least seems to bear the sense of 
' gambling hall ' in some passages. In the Upantaads, however, 
the words samiti and parisad assume a more definite sense, 
meaning ' an assembly of learned men in a particular locality '. 
The Chan. Up. V. 3.1 states that Sretaketu Aruneya uo ' repaired 
to the assembly (samiti) of the Paficalas (where Pravahana 
Jaivali put him five questions of a metaphysical and esoteric 
nature ). The Br. Up. VI. 2. 1 when narrating the same episode 
employs the word * parisad '. These passages establish that in 
the times of the Upanisads there were assemblies of learned 
men where intricate questions were disoussed. Gaut. 28. 46 
prescribes just as the Tai. Up. 1. 11 does that in matters about 
which there is no certain rule ( or there is doubt ) one should 
do what is commended by respectable persons not less than ten 
in number, who are clever in discussion and are above covetous- 
ness. M0! The Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 34 deolares that holidays other

than those Btated by him may be observed as settled by pariqads. 
The Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 41-45 prescribes " the relatives of a 
brahmac&rl who is guilty of sexual intercourse should empty 
a water pot in the parisad and the offender should confess ' I, 
so and so by name, am guilty of such and such a misdeed ' 
and that after the erring person has performed penance and 
when he has touched water, milk, ghee, honey and salt, 
the brahmanas should ask him ' have you performed the 
penance ? ' The other shall then reply ' yes ' ; then they shall 
admit him who has performed penance to all sacrificial rites 
making no difference between him and others."" 04 This clearly 
establishes that at least five centuries before the Christian era 
it was the privilege of the assembly of the learned brahmanas 
to administer penance to a sinner and then restore him to all 
rights of interdining and other social intercourse. Vas. Db. 
S. 1. 16 declares ' there is no doubt that whatever persons who 
have studied dharmasastra and the three Vedas expound as 
purifying themselves and others is the proper dharma.' Ap. Db. 
S. 1. 1. 1. 2 declares that the conventions of those that know 
dharma are the authoritative standard ( of conduct for ordinary 
men). When the smrtis declare that Veda, smrti and the usages 
of sisjas are the three sources of dharma (e. g. Vas. Dh. S. I. 4-5) 
they oonvey that sisjas can and should determine from time to 
time what is religious conduct. When Brhaspati enjoins that 
doubts about dharma should not be settled by blindly following 
the letter of sastras, but that logic and reasoning should be 
employed, he strikes the true note of the spirit of the ancient 
sages." 04 * Vide also Manu XII. 106 and Gaut. XI. 23-34 for 
the importance of tarka in settling matters of dharma. Manu 
XIL 108 states ' if one were to ask how one should act in 
matters of dharma on whioh no express rule is declared in this 
work, the reply is that in such cases what is declared to be 
a proper rule of conduct by respectable ( sista ) brahmanas 
would undoubtedly be the dharma.' Yaj. III. 300 requires that 
a person guilty of a Bin or lapse should declare it to an assem- 
bly of learned brahmanas and undergo such vrata ( penance and

observances ) as is approved of by the parisad. Samkarao&rya in 
his bbssya on Br. Up. IV. 3. 2 makes the very significant M0 * 
remark " it is therefore that in coming to a deoision on a subtle 
point of dharma, it is desirable to have a parisad working and 
a specially distinguished person is wanted ( to give the lead ) 
as stated in the rule ' a parisad should consist of not less than 
ten persons or of three or of one ( specially distinguished )'." 
These several authorities establish that for over 1500 years 
before the great Samkaracarya the parisad of learned brahmanas 
was the acknowledged authority for settling doubtful points of 
dharma and administering penanoes on lapses from proper 
conduct, and that Samkar&c&rya himself acknowledged this pri- 
vilege of the parisad. 

The next question is : what is the number of persons 
required to constitute a parisad for deoiding on doubtful points 
of dharma and what their qualifications should be. According 
to Gaut. 28. 46-47 a parisad should consist of at least ten M0 * 
persons viz. four, each of whom has mastered one Veda, three 
members who are respectively a ( perpetual ) student, a 
house-holder and a samnySsin and three more eaoh of whom has 
studied distinct dharmasastras. Vas. Dh. S. III. 20, Baud. 1. 1. 8, 
Par&sara VIII. 27 and Angiras declare that four persons each 
of whom has mastered one of the four Vedas, one who knows 
the MlmamsS, one who has studied the six subsidiary lores of 
the Veda, one who has studied dharmasastra and three persons 
who are a house-holder, a forest hermit and a sarhnyasin 
constitute a parisad of ten. Manu XII. Ill defines the ten as con- 
sisting of three masters of each of the three Vedas (excluding the 
Atharvaveda), one who has studied Logic, a student of MImamsft, 
a student of Nirukta, a master of dharmasastras and three 
members in eaoh of the first three asramas. Brbaspati 8807 
quoted in Far. M. II. 1 p. 218 deolares that a parisad may be 
constituted by seven or five persons sitting together who 
have studied the Vedas, their six subsidiary lores and 
dharmasastra and that such a parisad resembles a solemn

sacrifice. Vide also Angiras quoted by AparSrka p. 23 for 
seven or five men as 'constituting a parisad. Vas. Dh. S. III. 7, 
Yaj. 1.9, ManuXII.112, ParaSaraVIII.il state tbat at least 
four or three men should constitute a parisad, but they should be 
students of each of the four Vedas, should be agnihotrins and 
should have also studied dharmasastra. If even three cannot 
be found then even a single man can declare the dharma in case 
of doubt (Qaut. 28.48), but he must possess special qualifications. 
Gaut. 28. 48, Manu XII. 113 ( = Atri 143 ) require that he 
must be the best of brahmanas, a sis^a and a deep student of 
the Veda. Yaj. I. 9, Parasara VIII.' 13, Angiras 2 * 08 say that a 
single person who is the best among ascetics possessing know- 
ledge of the Self may form a parisad and declare what the pro- 
per rule is on a point of doubt. Though the texts permit in 
extreme cases a single man to declare dharma in case of doubt 
they give emphatic warning that this should not be done as far 
as possible. Baud. Dh. S. L 1. 13 observes** 09 'the way of dharma 
is very subtle and difficult to follow and it has many entrances 
( i. e. it appears different in different circumstances ) ; therefore 
a person though knowing much should not undertake single- 
banded to propound the proper course of conduct in case of 
doubt. ' The texts also emphasize that doubtful points of dharma 
are not to be decided by the votes of ignorant people, even if 
they muster in thousands. Manu XII. 114-115 ( =Baud. Dh. S. 
1. 1. 17 and 12=Vas. Dh. S. III. 5-6=Parasara VIII. 6 and 15) 
state ' Even if thousands of brahmanas who have observed no 
vrata and who have studied no Vedio mantras and who make 
their living merely by virtue of their caste come together they 
do not constitute & parisad. When suoh foolish persons deluded 
by ignorance and ignorant of dharma declare ( a penance for a 
sin) the sin is multiplied a hundred-fold and reaches the 
propounders. ' 

The Mit. on Yaj. III. 300 remarks that the number mention- 
ed as constituting a pariqad is not material, that all that is meant 
is that for lesser sins a small number of learned men oan

to the king ( and restore the sinner to his privileges ) but when 
the sin is grave, then the king and brahmanas must carefully 
examine the matter and then declare the penance. Parasara 
(VIII. 28-29) ordains 88 " ' brahmanas should declare penance 
for sins with the king's oonsent, that they Bhould not declare 
the expiation of sins by penance of their own motion and that 
if the king deoides to give prayasoitta without reference to 
brahmanas, the sin becomes increased a hundred-fold. ' It is 
the duty of the parisad to declare an appropriate penance when 
a man comes to it, declares his lapse and seeks to be freed from 
the taint and if the parisad knowing what the appropriate 
penanoe is refuses to administer it, they inour the same Bin as 
that committed by the man who approaches them. 8818 Parasara 
VIII. 2 prescribes that one should on being convinced of his 
having committed a sin at once repair to the assembly of 
learned men, should prostrate himself on tbe ground before 
them and request them to administer prayascitta ( expiation ). 
The Mit. on Taj. III. 300 quotes Parasara that the sinner should 
announce his sin after offering the present of a cow or a bull or 
the like to the parisad. 

It will be shown immediately below that these rules of tbe 
smrtis were observed to the letter by Hindu kings and learned 
brahmanas in medieval times. When the successors of Sarhkara- 
oarya began to interest themselves in the work done by the 
parisads for oenturies before the advent of the first Scarya cannot 
be ascertained. A large part of Northern India was under Moslem 
rule for about 500 years from about 1200 A. D. and a portion 
of the Deocan and a part of South India also were under Moslem 
rule for about three hundred years. Numerous documents have 
been published by the late Mr. Vishvanath K. Raj wade (a scholar

History, Marathi Philology and Marathi Literature ) and his 
friends. From these it appears that during the time of the 
Maratha domination learned brahmanas of holy places like 
Paithan, Nasik and Karad were consulted in religious matters 
by the king or his minister, that the holders of the ' gUdi* of 
Samkar&carya at Sankesvara and Earavlra and other seats 
were also rarely consulted in these matters and that it is only 
after the advent of the British rule that* 81 * the Samkaracaryas 
have begun to claim almost exolusive jurisdiction in ecclesiastic 
matters and in restoring men to their castes or excommunicat- 
ing them for lapses. It will be seen from passages quoted 
below that both the learned brahmanas at holy places like 
Karad and the ^arhkaraoaryas claim the exclusive right in these 
matters by reason of immemorial usage. 

In several works it is said that the pariqad must be consti- 
tuted by sisfcs ( vide Gaut. 28. 46 ). Sisfc is variously defined 
by some emrti works. The Baud. Mw Dh. S. ( I. 1. 5-6 ) says 
' Sisfas are those who are free from envy and pride, who keep 
only as much oorn as is measured by kumbhl ( vide p. Ill /. n. 
235 ), who are free from greed and from hypocrisy, arrogance, 
oovetousness, delusions and anger. Those are sis^as who have 
studied the Veda acoording to the prescribed method, together 
with its appendages ( viz. Itihasa and Puranas ), who know how 
to draw inferences fiom that and who tend to make people 
realize the teaohing of the Veda.' The Mahabhasya defines 
Biswas in almost the same words as Baud. Dh. S. 1. 1. 5. Vas. Dh. 
S. 1. 6 defines sis^a as one whose mind is free from desires.

derive the word sista and restrict it to Manu.the saven sages and 
other similar great sages, who in eaoh soon ( Manvantara or 
yuga ) settle the rules of conduct for succeeding ages. 

It is well-known that Shivaji, the great founder of the 
Maratha Empire, established a counoil of eight ministers, viz. 
Mukhya Pradhana, Amatya, Saoiva, Mantrl, Senapati, Pandita- 
rao, NySyadhlsa and Sumanta. 'The jurisdiction of the 
Panditarao extended over im all religious matters, he was to 
examine and decide disputes about dharma and adharma, he 
was to honour sistas ( respectable people ) on behalf of the 
king, was to make his signature expressing his approval of the 
writings ( decisions ) about acara, vyavahara and prayasoitfcas 
( made by learned brahmanas ). He was to superintend and 
oarry into immediate execution gifts, propitiatory rites (for the 
king).' This shows that even in matters of prayascitta 
( penance for lapses and sins ) the final control rested with the 
Panditarao, who used to send doubtful matters to learned 
brahmanas at holy places like Wai, Nasik, Earad for their 
opinions and accept them. There are letters which show that 
the Panditarao convened meetings of learned brahmanas and 
with their approval deolared prayascitta in the case of a 
brahmana who had been forcibly converted by Mahomedans 
and who was thereafter restored to caste. 

That sometimes the Pontiff of the Sankesvara matha was 
consulted even in disputes about rights to lands and villages 
follows from a decision contained in Rao Bahadur Vad's work 
pp. 203-210 ( of 1730 A. D. ). Here a dispute arose between 6rl- 
karacarya (to whom a village had been donated by king Rajarama) 
and his agnates, who, taking advantage of the fact that the gift- 
deed was made in the name of five persons including Srlkara- 
carya, put forward their claims to that village. This dispute 
was referred to the Sv&rol of Sankesvara and Karavira who 
deoided on the authority of Vijnanesvara, the Vyavaharama- 
yukha and the Danakamalakara that though the document was

that therefore he alone was the true owner. 

There are cases where the head of the Karavlra matha issued 
an order ( in sake 1644 i. e. 1722 A. D. ) asking people to dine 
with a brahmana whose wife had illicit connection with a gosavi 
and who had performed the neoessary prayascitta. ,817 

On the other hand in numerous instanoes the assembly of 
learned brahmanas was approached either by the Panditarao or by 
the interested parties themselves to declare the proper penance 
and restore the guilty party to his caste. m * Numerous docu- 
ments and letters showing the part played by the family of Qijre 
at Karad ( in the Satara District) in the matter of giviug deci- 
sions on questions of dharma-sastra hare been published by 
the late Mr. V. X. Rajvade. One Gangadhara Banganatha 
Kulkarni of Harsul M,8 » was foroibly converted by the 
Moslems ; then the Maratha king Sambhaji ordered his minister 
the Panditarao to restore him to his caste after giving him appro- 
priate prSyascitta and the Fanditarao called a meeting of 
learned brahmanas, looked into works like the Mitaksara and 
with the approval of the brahmanas administered prayascitta to 
him and sent him on a pilgrimage. There is a similar case in

laarned brshmanas of Karad about the prayasoitta to be admi- 
nistered to one Khandu Jadhav *"• who had been foroibly made 
by the Moslems to eat their food and in which he informs the 
brahmanas that a fee of two rupees should be taken from the 
man. It may be noted in passing that Raje Netaji Palkar who 
was one of the great commanders under Shivaji, the founder of 
the Maratha Empire, was made a moslem by the Mogul 
Emperor Aurangzeb and was subsequently taken baok into the 
Hindu fold hy Shivaji. In another document mo the learned 
brahmanas of Poona, 46 in number, write to the brahmanas of 
Karavlra about one Narasimha Bhafta Toro of Paithan who 
had engaged as a prieBfc in a Vedio sacrifice in which he had 
offered the effigy of an animal made of flour, who had therefore 
been made outcast and who was subsequently restored to the 
oaste after undergoing penance. 

The above brief account will show that for hundreds of 
years even before the first SamkarHc&rya flourished it was the 
privilege of the assembly of learned brShmanas to decide doubt- 
ful points of religious conduct and presoribe penanoes for 
lapses, that the same privilege continued undisturbed till the 
advent of the British rule, that rarely the heads of the manias, 
by virtue of their eminent position, their supposed detaohment 
from and renunciation of worldy affairs and their reputation as 
ascetics, were asked to deoide (following Yaj. I. 9 ) doubtful 
points of religious and theological importance, that it is only 
during the last few decades that such heads began to claim 
ezolusive jurisdiction in suoh matters. 

It is desirable in the interest of the solidarity of the several 
Hindu oastes and the rapid growth of progressive and advanoed 
views that matters of practices, penances and restoration to 
oaste should be in the hands of the bodies of learned men or the 
caste itself than in the hands of a single ascetio styling himself 
Samkaracarya, who often happens to know nothing of dharma- 
sastra and only puts his seal of approval on what interested 
persons that are round him say.

Oh. JCXVlII ] Sarknyaaa-aspects of 975 

After this review of the stage of samnyasa we see that 
asceticism presents several aspects viz. fasting or at least 
reducing the intake of food, abstention from meat and drink 
and pleasures of sense, total absence of sexual gratification and 
suppression of the sexual emotion, vow of silence, sleeping on - 
bare ground, nakedness or making use of minimum clothing, 
contempt for the world and its riohes. The Hindu Scriptures 
however do not enjoin self-infliction of pain or flagellation that 
was indulged in by monks in the early centuries of Christianity. 
Asoeticism in the several forms indioated above is a feature 
common to all religions. It is the fashion to assert that 
Indians" 81 have the highest regard for asoeticism and that the 
men whose memories they cherish as ideals of human oonduct 
are ascetics. This statement is only partially true. Christ also 
taught abandonment of worldly ties and the spurning of riches 
as the best for entering the Kingdom of Heaven ( vide 
Matthew 19. 21, Luke 14. 26 and 33, St. John 2. 15-16 ). It is 
only during the last three or four hundred years that Western 
peoples have given up much of what was thought for centuries 
to be the main teaching of Christ and regard successful men of 
aotion or politicians or men of martial exploits as their ideals 
and heroes. In India also martial glory has often raised men 
to the position of heroes or avataras, but only when they 
delivered their countrymen from the tyranny and persecution 
of evil men or foreigners. Parasur&ma, Efima and Krsna are 
avataras beoause they fought against tyranny and barbarity and 
not because they brought as large a slice of the earth under 
their domination as possible for purposes of exploitation or 
vainglory. Martial exploits for self-aggrandisement or for 
domination for domination's sake have never evoked great 
enthusiasm in India. Shivaji, the great hero of the Marathas, 
was paid almost divine honours even during his life-time not for 
his martial exploits, but for his having freed the Marathas and 
other peoples from Moslem tyranny, persecution, religious 
intolerance and fanaticism. 



2221, Vide ' Mystics, ascetics and saints of India ' ( 1903 ) by J. 0.

CHAPTER XXIX 

SRAUTA (VEDIC) SACRIFICES* 

Introductory 

A deep study of Vedio sacrifices is quite essential for the 
proper understanding of the Vedic Literature, for arriving at 
approximately oorreot statements about the chronology, the 
development and the stratification of the different portions of 
that Literature and for the influence that that Literature exerted 
on the four varnas and the casto-system, on the splitting up of 
the brahmanas themselves among several sub-castes !MS and on 
the institution of gotras and pravaras. Early European soholars 
generally paid scant attention to the deep study of the Vedio 
sacrifices and endeavoured to understand the meaning of the 
Vedas principally by reference to grammar, oomparative 
philology and the comparison of several passages containing 
the same word or words. Max MQller put forward a tentative 
soheme of ohronology based mostly on subjective considera- 
tions and prompted by the great prejudice felt by European 
scholars generally against admitting any great antiquity for 
the Vedas. Therefore the endeavour of most European soholars 
has been to show that the mantras could not have been composed 
before 1400 B. 0. It is beyond the scope of this work to enter 
into any discussion about the dates of the various seotions of the 
Vedio Literature. It must be here said, however, that I do not 
subscribe to the view that 1400 B. O. is the uppermost limit of 
the original composition of the Vedio hymns. The hymns may 
have been composed for aught we know several thousand years

before tbat date. Most of the Vedic Samhitas that we now 
have are arranged (except the Rgveda to some extent) definitely 
for the various aspects of the cult of the sacrifice and indicate a 
state of things when different priests were required for the 
sacrifices, who used mantras from the collections they had 
studied. 

For a thorough understanding of Vedic sacrifices, the 
several Veda Samhitas, the Brahmanas and the Srauta sutras 
must be carefully studied. Among works in English that are 
very helpful must be mentioned, Haug's translation ( with 
notes ) of the Aitareya B.-ahmana, Prof. Eggeling's translation 
of the Satapatha Brahmana with notes (3.B. E. vol. XII, XXVI, 
XLI, XL1II, XLIV ), Prof. Keith's ' Religion and Philosophy 
of the Veda and Upanisads \ translation of the Blaok Yajurveda 
( 2 voL in Harvard Oriental Series ) and of the Rgveda 
Brahmanas ( one volume in the same series ), Kunte's ' Vicis- 
situdes of Aryan civilization in India.' ( 1880 ) particularly 
pp. 167-232. Besides these Weber and Hillebrandt have written 
in German scholarly works on Vedic sacrifices; Caland and 
Henry published a very learned, exhaustive and methodical 
work in French on the Agnistoma (1906). In this connection 
the late Dr. S. V. Ketkar's labours and researches embodied in 
his Marathi Encyclopaedia ( vol. 2 and 5 ) are worthy of special 
consideration, since they furnish a much-needed corrective to 
the somewhat one-sided views of most European scholars that 
have written on Vedic Literature, though one is bound to differ 
from him in several matters.'" 3 The following pages are 
based principally on the original texts, though here and there 
the works of modern scholars have been availed of. 

In his Purvamlmamsasutra, Jaimini submits thousands of 
texts to the principles of mlmarhsa elaborated by him and 
arrives at definite conclusions on matters affecting the details 
of various sacrifices. An attempt has been made in these 
chapters on srauta to include many of his conclusions, a task, 
which so far as I know, has not been essayed by any modern 
writer on dharma or srauta up till now. 

2223. Prof. Dumont's 'L'Agnihotra' (1939) came into my hands 
when these pages were passing through the press. Hillebrandt's 'Das 
Altindisohe Neu-und Vollmondsopfer' (Jena, 1879) and 'Ritual- 
Jiitteratur Vedisohe Opfer und Zauber' (1897, in the Encyclopedia o£ 
Indo-Aryan Philology and Antiquities) deserredly enjoy a high 
reputation among works on tfrauta saorifioes.

97$ History erf bharmaiMtv [ Oh. XXIX 

The fundamental conceptions of Yajfla ( sacrifice ) go back 
to Indo-European 8M * antiquities though the traces are rather 
faint. But it is quite clear that the cult of the sacrifice had 
been much developed in the Indo-Iranian period. There is a 
very striking resemblance between the Vedic Agnistoma and 
the Homa ceremony of the Parsis ( vide Haug's Ait. Br. vol. I, 
Introduction p. 59 ff ). There are numerous words indicative 
of the cult of the sacrifice both in the Vedio language and in 
the ancient Parsi religious books. For example, words like 
athaTvan, Shuti, uktha, barhis, mantra, yajna, soma, savana, 
stoma, hotr do also occur in the ancient Parsi religious 
scriptures." 28 Though Vedic sacrifices are now very rarely 
performed ( except a few simple ones like the Darsa-purnamasa 
and the Caturmssyas ), they were in great vogue several 
centuries before the Christian era. Centuries after the advent 
and spread of Buddhism we learn from inscriptions and literary 
traditions that kings often performed the ancient solemn Vedio 
sacrifices and gloried in having done so. In the Harivarhsa 
(III. 2. 39-40), in the Malavikagnimitra ( Act V, which speaks 
of Rajasuya), in the Sunga Inscription from AyodhyS ( E. I. 
vol. XX. p. 54 ) Senapati Pusyamitra is said to have performed 
the Asvamedha (or Rajasuya). In the Hathigumpha Inscription 
( E. I. vol. XX. at p. 79 ) king Kharavela is extolled as having 
performed the Rajasuya. In the Bilsad stone Inscription of 
Kumaragupta dated in the Gupta year 96 ( i. e. 415-6 A. D. ) it 
is stated that his great ancestor Samudragupta performed the 
Asvamedha that had gone out of vogue for a long time 
( cirotsannasvamedhahartuh, in Gupta Inscriptions at p. 43 ). 
In the Pardi plates (of Cedi saih. 207 i. e. 456-7 A. D.) the Trai- 
kutaka king Dahrasena is described as the performer of 
Asvamedha ( E. I. vol. X. p. 53 ). The Plkira grant of Sirhha- 
varman ( E. I. vol. VIII. p. 162 ) describes the Pallayas as the 
performers of many Asvamedhas and another Pallava grant 
(in E. I vol. I p. 2 at p. 5 ) refers to the performance of 
Agnistoma, Vajapeya and Asvamedha. The Chammak plate of 
the Vakafaka king Pravarasena II ( Gupta Inscriptions No. 55

p. 236) speaks of Pravarasena I as the performer of many 
drauta sacrifices. 88 " 

The original worship of fire may have been individualistic 
as well as communal or tribal. The daily agnihotra was an 
individual affair; but as even simple istis like darsapurnamasa 
required four priests, and Soma sacrifices required 16 priests 
and costly preparations, these sacrifices partook more or less of 
a public or at least congregational character. It appears that 
as most brahmanas were poor and could not carry on even the 
daily agnihotra, which pinned them down practically to one 
place and did not allow them to move out of the village for 
securing their livelihood, even agnihotra must have been 
comparatively rare in early times. Such Vedic sentences as 
' one who has begot a son or sons and whose hair is still blaok 
should consecrate the Vedic fires ' (quoted by Sahara on Jaimini 
I. 3. 3 and cited on p. 350 above) establish that agnyfidhana was 
advised for brahmanas when they had reached middle age ( and 
not before ). The daily agnihotra required the maintenance of 
at least two cows, besides thousands of cow-dung cakes and 
fuel-sticks. For the maintenance of agnihotra and the perfor- 
mance of darsapurnamasa (in which four priests were employed) 
and the Caturmasyas ( where five priests were required ) the 
house-holder was required to be well-to-do. And the Soma 
sacrifices could be performed only by kings, nobles and the rich 
and by those who could collect large subscriptions. We find 
that kings while making grants often expressed that the object 
of the grants was to enable the brahmana donees to offer ball, 
and cam and to perform agnihotra. For example, in the Sarsavni 
plates of Buddhar&ja dated in Kataccuii sam. 361 i. e. 609-10 
A. D. the grant is made for bait, caru and agnihotra and in the 
Damodarpur plates (dated 413-14 and 447-48 A.D.) the grants are 
made for agnihotra and for the performance of the five daily 
yajnas." 87 During the centuries of Moslem domination no help 
from royalty could be expected and so the institution of Vedic 
sacrifices languished. In the last hundred years or so, solemn

980 History of DharmaiMra [ Oh. XXIX 

Vedio saorifioes have been performed only rarely. But, since 
many of the grhya ceremonies as set forth in the grhya sutras 
closely imitate the procedure of the Vedio fire cult and Vedio 
sacrifices formed the first and foremost manifestation of the 
sentiments of faith and worship in India, a work dealing with 
Dharmasastra cannot be said to have dealt with its subject 
completely and adequately if the treatment of Vedio sacrifices 
were left out altogether, the following bare outline is presented 
here, the more so as sacrifioes were the first dharmas according 
to Rg. X. 90. 16. 

The Srauta-sutras contain a very detailed, meticulously 
accurate and vivid description of the several sacrifices that 
were performed in anoient times. These works were manuals 
compiled for the practical purpose of giving directions to those 
who engaged in such sacrifices. They are based on ancient 
Brahmona texts, which they quote at every step, many 
individual sutras being couched in the very language of the 
Brahmanas, and on aotual practice and only bring together what 
was in vogue. The object of the following pages is not to 
present a thorough and detailed treatment of Vedio sacrifices, 
but only to indioate what the cult of the Vedio sacrifice was 
like and to furnish a brief description of some prominent sacri- 
fices. The treatment is mainly based on the Srautasufcras of 
As v., Ap., Kat., Baud., Satyasadha with occasional references 
to the Sarhhitas and Brahmanas. The several divergences 
among the sutras, the paddhatis and modern practice are not 
generally dwelt upon for the sake of saving space. One very 
useful work is a compilation called ' Srautapadarthanirvacana,' 
by Nageshwar Shastri published in the Benares Sanskrit series, 
though one of its drawbacks is that it gives no references 
to any texts. The Mlmarhsa-vidyalay a at Poona has prepared 
sets of all the utensils required in sacrifioes and has published 
an album containing piotures of utensils and maps of various 
altars required in Vedio sacrifices. The C&turmasyas, the 
Pasubandha, the Jyotisfama have been described in some detail, 
the darsapurnamasa has been dealt with in extenso, and other 
saorifioes have been only briefly touched upon in this work. 

We find that even in the remotest ages when the hymns of 
the Bgveda SamhitS were composed and compiled, the main 
features of the sacrificial system had been evolved. That there 
were three fires appears clear from Bg. II. 36. 4 ( where Agni 
is asked to sit down in three places ), 1 15. 4, V. 11. 2 ('men 



Oh XXIX ] irauta Sacnflces-in the Bgveda 981 

kindle Agni in three places ' ). The Gftrhapatya fire is express- 
ly named in Rg. L 15. 12. The three savanaa ( i. e. pressings of 
Soma in the morning, mid-day and evening) are mentioned in 
Rg. III. 28. 1 ( pratah-sava ), III. 28. 4 ( madhyandina savana ), 
III. 28. 5 ( trtlya Bavana ), III. 52. 5-6 and in IV. 12. 1 ( where 
it is said that the sacrifice gives food to Agni three times on all 
days ), IV. 33. 11. It may be affirmed that the Bkfceen priests 8888 
required in Soma sacrifices were probably well-known to the 
composers of the Rgveda hymns ; Rg. 1. 162. 5 mentions hotr, 
adhvaryu, agnimindha (agnit or agnldhra), grSvagrftbha 
( gravastut ), sarhsta ( prasastr or maitravaruna ), suvipra 
(brahma?); Rg. II. 1. 2 refers to hotr., potr., nes^r, agnit, 
prasastr ( maitravaruna ), adhvaryu, brahma ; Rg. II. 36 speaks 
of hotr, potr (v. 2 ), agnldhra ( v. 4 ), brahmana ( brahmanac- 
charhsin ) and prasastr ( v. 6 ). In Rg. II. 43. 2 we have udgffla. 
In Rg. III. 10. 4, IX 10. 7, X. 35. 10, X. 61. 1 seven hotrs are 
referred to and in Rg. II. 5. 2 the potr priest is spoken of as 
the 8th. The word ' purohita ' occurs very frequently ( Rg. 1. 1. 

I, I. 44. 10 and 12, III. 2. 8, IX. 66. 20, X 98. 7 ). The Rgveda 
names Atiratra ( VII. 103. 7 ), Trikadruka ( II. 22. 1, VIII. 13. 
18, VIII. 92. 21, X 14. 16 ). The yiipa ( the post to which the 
sacrificial animal was tied ) and its top called casala are 

2228. The sixteen priests ( rtvij ) are : sfar jbrra*"airS'5rr<n«fft vm-

brahma* and udgStt are the four principal ones and the three that 
follow each of them in the above enumeration are their assistants. 
The functions of the four principal priests aro referred to in Ijtg. X.71.11. 
In ljg. II. 43.1 wo have the singer of SSmans. In Agnihotra only adhvaryu 
is required, in the Agnysdheya, DardaparnamSsa and other iftis four 
priests are required viz. adhvaryu, agnldhra, hotr and brahman ; in the 
CsturmSsyas five are required viz., the four (of dardapHrnamSsa ) and 
the pratipasthstr ; in the animal sacrifices a sixth is addod viz., the 
maitrBvaruna. In Soma sacrifices all sixteen aro required. In the 
oUturraKsya called sakamedha the Sgnldhra is addressed as brahmaputra 
( vide Asv. Sr. II. 18. 18) and this may explain ?g. II. 43. 2 (cited on 
p. 27 above) where the word « brahmaputra ' occurs). Vide Tai. Br. 

II. 3. 6 and Baud. II. 3 for these provisions about the number of priests 
required. Some added a 17th priest called aadasya and Baud. II. 3 gavo 
him three assistants also, though the Sat. Br. X. 4. 2. 19 forbids the 
employment of a 17th priest. There aro other persons required in a 
sacrifice, such as the Samitr, tho oamasSdhvaryus, but they are not 
called rtvij. Vido Ap. XXII. 1. 3-6 for the Trikadruka called Jyotir, 
Gauh and Ayah.

mentioned in Rg. 1. 162. 6. Rg. III. 8 is full of the praise of 
the yupa. The person who killed the animal sacrificed ( the 
samitr ) is mentioned in Rg. 162. 10 and V. 43. 4. The Gharma 
(the pot of boiled milk required in the Pravargya rite or 
perhaps the Dadhigharma in the madhyandina savana) is 
mentioned in Rg. III. 53. 14, V. 30. 15, V. 43. 7. It was 
believed that the animal offered in a sacrifice went to heaven. 8 "* 
Fire for sacrifice was produced by attrition from two ararus 
( vide Rg. III. 29, 1-3, V. 9. 3, VI. 48. 5 ). The darvl ( Rg. V. 
6. 9 ), sruo ( Rg. IV. 12. 1, VI. 11. 5 ), juhu ( Rg. X. 21. 3 ) are 
mentioned in the Rg. Numerous verses in praise of gifts occur 
in the Rg, which have been pointed out above ( pp. 837-839 ). 
In Rg. III. 53. 3 there is a clear reference to the call or permis- 
sion sought by the hotr ( ahava ) and the response of the 
adhvaryu (pratigara). tm Rg. X. 114. 5 speaks of the twelve 
grahas ( cups) of Soma. In Rg. I. 28. 1-2 reference is made to 
the broad-bottomed stone (gravan) used for beating Soma 
stalks, the mortar in which Soma is pounded and the adhisavana 
( pressing ) board. In Rg. I. 20. 6, L 110. 3, I. 161. 1 and 
VIII. 82. 7 the wooden vessel called ' camasa ' used for drinking 
Soma is spoken of. The word ' avabhrtha ' ( concluding bath 
in a Soma sacrifice ) occurs in Rg. VIII. 93. 23. In Rg. X. 51. 
8-9 the words prayaja and anuyaja occur. The ten iprl 
hymns of the Rgveda indicate that at the time of their composi- 
tion the animal sacrifice had already some of the principal 
features that are seen in the srauta sutras. 

Some of the general rules applicable in all srauta rites 
may be stated once for all. Vide 5iv. sr. 1. 1. 8-22. Unless 
otherwise expressly stated, the sacrificer should always face 
the north, should sit down cross-legged, and the sacrificial mate- 
rials (like kusa grass &o.) should have their ends pointed to- 
wards the east. The sacred thread should be worn in all rites 
in the upavita form, except where the nivlta or praoInSvIta form 
is expressly ordained; wherever a limb (anga) is mentioned or 
no particular limb is mentioned, it is the right limb (hand* 
foot, finger) that is meant; wherever the word ' dadati'(he

gives ) is used the yajamana ( the sacrificer ) is the agent of 
tbe action. Eat. sr. I. 10. 12 states that the yajamana is the 
actual performer in the case of gifts or repeating texts where 
the word ' vacayati * oocurs in the sutras or in anva-rambhana, 
or in choosing a boon, in the case of observances ( such as 
truthfulness ), and in the case of measures ( i. e. when it is said 
that a thing should be of the height of a man, it is the sacri- 
ficer'a height that is meant ). When any rite is prescribed 
without expressly stating the performer, it is the hotr who does 
it and in the case of praya&cittas wherever the words ' juhoti ' 
and ' japati ' occur the brahmfi priest is the agent to do those 
latter acts. When the first pada of a rk is mentioned for being 
employed in any rite the whole verse is intended to be recited ; 
when the first words of a hymn are mentioned for being 
employed in a rite, but the words quoted in the sutra do not 
amount to a pada, the whole hymn is to be repeated in that 
rite ; wherever more than the first pada of a verse is mentioned, 
it is intended that three verses are to be recited ( that verse and 
the two following ). Japa, amantrana, abhimantrana, apyayana, 
upasthana and mantras that indicate the rite that is being 
performed are to be recited in a low voice ( uparftsu ). A special 
rule ( apavada or visesavidhi ) is stronger than a general rule 
( prasanga ). 

Other general propositions are : Yaga ( sacrifice ) is con- 
stituted by dravya ( material ), devata ( deity ) and tyaga and 
yaga means abandonment of dravya intending it for a deity ; 
homa means the offering of dravya in fire intending it for a 
deity. Yajatis ( sacrificial rites ) for which no express reward 
is declared E8SI by the texts are the anga ( subordinate part ) of 
the principal ySga. Mantras are of four categories viz. rk, 
yajus, saman and nigada ; !E38 rks are metrical ; a yajus has 
no restriction as to metre, but it is a complete sentenoe ( Kat. 
sr. I. 3. 2); a saman is sung; nigadas are praisas i. e. words 
addressed to another calling upon the latter to do a certain 
thing e. g. ' proksanlr-asadaya, sruoah sammrddhi * ( Kat. Sr. 

2281. «i3 H <m«j | f wdawtMf <i I VRxm- *ft. I- 2. 4; vide ^ffifa IV. 
4. 84 for a similar into. 

2232. The division into tk, yajus, and slman was made evon be- 
fore the JJk-samhita" was composed. For ik, vide Bg. X. 71. 11 and 
X. 90. 9, for yajus Bg. V. 62. 5 and X. 90. 9, for sSman %. VIII.

II. 6. 34 ). They are yajus, but they ore distinguished from 
ordinary yajus formulae by the fact that nigadas are uttered 
loudly, while ordinarily a yajus is recited in a low voice. 
Jaimini in II. 1. 38-45 brings out this distinction between 
ordinary yajus and nigada. Vide Jaimini II. 1. 35-37 for the 
definitions of rk, saman and yajus. Verses from the Rg. and 
Samaveda are recited loudly, all yajus are muttered in a low 
voice except asruta ( i. e. pissage3 like ' asrSvaya ' ), pratyS- 
eruta ( the response ' astu arausat ' ), pravara-mantra ( sgnir 
devo hota &o,, set out in note 1139 above ), sarhvada ( requests 
and permissions as in ' brahman, shall I sprinkle with water ' 
and ' yes, do sprinkle ' ), sam-praisa ( summons to do something 
as ' proksanlr-asadaya ). Loudness is of three kinds, high- 
pitched, middle-pitched and low-pitched. The SamidhenI verses 
are to be recited in a middle pitch, all mantras in the rites from 
anvadhana upto ajyabhaga in Jyotistoma and pratah-eavana 
are to be recited in a low pitch, while in all rites in darsapur- 
namasa the mantras are to be recited in a low pitch from ajya- 
bhaga to svistakrt. The rest of the mantras in daraapurna- 
mfisa after svistakrfc and in Trtlya Savana are to be recited 
in high pitch. Mantras that are being recited at the time 
of doing anything ( and produce the idea ' I shall do it * ) 
are to be recited first and then the act is to be begun ( e. g. 
cutting is to be done immediately on reciting ' ise tva * ). Vide 
Jaimini XII. 3. 25. An act is to be begun to be performed the 
moment the reciting of a mantra accompanying it is finished 
( Kat. I. 3. 5-7 ). Utkara is the spot where the dust of the Vedi 
is swept up and prariita is water kept in a vessel to the north 
of the ahavanlya after repeating a mantra over it. The sacrifi- 
cial ground where the fires are maintained is called vihara 
( Sahara on Jaimini XII. 2, 1 says ' vihara iti gSrhapatyadira- 
gnietretocyate viharanat ' ). The way for going to or coming 
from the vihara is between the prariita ( water ) and utkara in 
the case of istfs ( i. e. to the east of utkara and to the west of 
pranlta ) and between the utkara and the catv&la pit in other 
cases (Ap. sr.I. 1. 4-6, Kat. sr. 1.3.42-43). This path for 
going to the vihara is called tlrtba. The catv&la is a pit which 
is required only in soma and animal sacrifices. Many sacrificial 
utensils are required out of whioh the sruva ( which may be 
called the dipping spoon ) is made of khadira wood and is one 
aratni in length and has a mouth (or bowl) that is rounded and is 
as wide as the front joint of the thumb. The sruc (offering ladle) 
Is one oubit in length, has a bowl at one end of the shape and

upabhrt of asvattha and the dhruvft is made of vikankata

but those that are not directly oonneofced with noma are made 
of varana tree ; the sword called sphya is made of khadira 
( Eat. L 3. 31-39 ). The principal yajilapatraa ( or yajfiftyudhas 
as they are often called ) are given in the note below. 52 * 8

each is suitable or is prescribed by a special text. Vide also Jai.

time. The kapSlas (potsherds ) whatever their number form one pStra ; 
they are pieces broken from a jar. The pairs are : sphya (the wooden 
sword) and kapsla, then the dOrpa (made of split bamboo or of nada 
grass or of reed ) and agnibotra-havanl and so on. The com. on Est. 
II. 3. 8 says that whatever pstras may be required in the several 
rites are to be got ready and he enumerates many such pStras. 
The juho, upabhrt and dhruvS symbolically represent respectively 
the right arm, the left arm and the trunk of yajfia. Vide Sat. Br. 
I. 3. 2. 2. The number of kapSlas varies according to the rite that is 
performed and the antra of the performer. Besides the ten princi- 
pal ones enumerated above there are others that are required viz.

names and sizes of all these and other utensils and for directions on

final disposal of the yajfiapStras. Jaimini (XI. 3. 43-44 ) declares that 
though the yajfiapStras are set out in the 'sruti' texts when apeaking 
about paurnamSsi ifti, still they are to be made ready at agnySdheya 
and are to be kept throughout since that date till the sacriftcer's death 
and that their cremation with the sacrifioer's body is their final disposal

to the contrary) by the garhapatya fire, but the cooking of a havis 
may be done on either garhapatya or ahavanlya according to one's 
sutra. When the material is not specified, homa is performed with 
clarified butter and all homas are done in the ahavanlya when 
there is no express text and the juhu ladle is to be employed in 
offering homa ( Kfit 1. 8. 44-45 ). Those parts that are to be done 
with Rg. mantras are to be done by the hotr priest ( unless there 
be a special direction or reason to the contrary ), the adhvaryu 
does what is to be done with Yajurveda, the udgatr with Saraa- 
veda and the brahma priests with all the three Vedas m * ( vide 
Ait. Br. 25. 8 ). Brahmanas alone are to be priests ( Jai. XII. 
4. 42-47 ). The sacrificer's wife is seated south-west of the 
garhapatya fire and her face is turned towards the north-east 
( Zat. II. 7. 1 ). At the beginning of an istf or other rite five 
operations ( called bhusamskara ) are to be performed on the 
mound (khara) of the ahavanlya and also on that of the 
daksina fire viz. parisamuhana ( sweeping round with wet hand) 
thrice from the east to the north, smearing thrice with cowdung 
( gomaya-upalepana ), drawing with the wooden sword ( sphya ) 
three lines from south to north but towards the east ( i. e. the 
last is to be in the east ) or from east to west but towards the 
north, to remove the dust from those lines with the thumb and 
the ring finger, and sprinkling thrice with water (abhyuksana). 

Agnyadheya Em 
Gaut. ( VIII. 20-21 ) enumerates seven haviryajfias and 
seven somasafiisthas. Agnyadheya is the first of the seven 
haviryajflas. Agnyadheya is the same as agnyadhana. It is an 
isti, which word means ' a sacrifice performed by a saorifioer 
and his wife.with the help of four priests ' ( vide above note 
2228 ). The details of a model ls\\ are given later on under 
dars&purnamasa. Agnyadheya occupies two days, the first day 
called upavasatha being taken up by preliminary matters and 
the 2nd with performance of the main rites. There are two 
times for the performance of agnyadheya. It may be done on 
one of the seven naksatras, viz., Krttika, Bohinl, Mrgaslrsa, 
Purva Phalgunl, Ufctara PbalgunI, Visakha, Uttara Bbadrapada.

appropriate naksatras whan the saorificer desires oertain results 
( V. 3. 3-14 ). Acoording to Sat. Br. II. 1. 2. 17 and JLp. V. 3. 13 
a kaatriya should consecrate sacred fires on the Citra naksatra. 
Or agnyadheya may be done on a parva day in spring by a 
brahmana, in summer, in the rainy season and autumn respec- 
tively by a ksatriya, a vaisya and an upakrusfa ( for the latter 
vide p. 74 above ). But even when choosing the season, one 
must have regard to the seven naksatras speoified above. Ap. 
states that the setting up of the fires may take place on Full 
moon or New moon day and that hemanta or iarad is the proper 
season for a vaisya, the rainy season for a rathakara( carpenter) 
or all the varnas may first consecrate the fires in HUra ( Ap. 
V. 3. 17-20 ). Vide Jai. II. 3-4 about the meaning of the Vedio 
passage ' a brahmana should set up fires in spring ' ( Tai. Br. 
1. 1. 2 ). The Sat. Br. ( IIL 1. 2. 19 ) appears to condemn the 
setting up of fires by relianoe on naksatras and recommends 
( XL 1. 1. 7 ) that agnyadhana should be performed on the New 
moon of Vaisakha on which there is RohinI naksatra. In case 
of difficulty one may perform agnyadheya in any season and if 
one has resolved upon performing a soma saorifioe one need not 
stop to consider the season or naksatra. The man who wants 
to perform agnyadheya must not be too young nor too old ( vide 
p. 979 above ). 

Agnyadheya means the placing of burning ooals for the 
generation of the garhapatya and other fires at a particular 
time and place by a particular person to the accompaniment 
of certain mantras." 8 * Agnyadheya comprehends the several 
acts from the bringing of the arartis ( two wooden logs ) to the 
offering of purnahufci. When this last takes place the person 
who engages in the rites attains the position of an ahitagni 
(one who has consecrated the sacred Vedio fires ). Agnyadhana 
is meant for all sacrificial rites and not merely for enabling a 
man to perform darsapurnamasesti ( Jai. III. 6. 14-15, XI. 3. 2). 
The aacrifioer should bring home through the adhvaryu priest 
two aranis from an asvattha tree that grows inside a saml tree 
with the mantra ' yo asvatthah saml-garbhah * ( Asv. II. 1. 17 ), 
The branch to be cut must be one on the east or north side of

touohes the ground should be used for making the lower arani. 
Two aranis ( logs of the branoh ) should be out off, planed and 
formed into rectangular pieoes and they should be allowed to 
become dry. In the lower arani there is a spot called devayoni 
( the place of origin of the god i. e. fire ) which is 8 and 12 angu- 
las from the two ends of the lower arani ( of 24 angulas) where 
by means of a drill inserted in the upper arani fire is produced 
by attrition. Acoording to Baud, each arani is 16 angulas long, 
twelve in breadth and 4 in height, while according to K&t. 
( as quoted in com. on Ap. ) it is 24 angulas long. Acoording to 
Ap. (V. 1. 3) the asvattha may not be growing inside a saml tree. 
The two aranis are invoked ( abhiraantrana ) with the formula 
' asvatth5d...dhehi ayur-yajamane ' ( Tai. Br. I. 2. 1. ) and the 
adhvaryu brings together on the altar ( vedi ) seven items that 
are earthy and seven items that are of wood or five of eaoh or 
8 earthy items ( if those of wood are seven ). The eight earthy 
items are : sand, saltish earth, the earth from a hole infested by 
mice, the earth from an ant-hill, the day ( suda ) from the 
bottom of a reservior of water that never dries up, earth that is 
struck by wild boars, pebbles, gold ( Ap. V. 1. 4 ff . ) with 
mantras appropriate 8887 to eaoh. The seven wooden items are : 
( parts of ) asvattha, udumbara, parna ( palasa ), saml, vikan. 
kafci, a tree struok by lightning ( or by wind or cold ) and a 
lotus-leaf. Baud. II. 12 enumerates these somewhat differently. 
The sacrificer prepares a raised place for worship (devayajana)" 88 

2237. In Tai. Br. I. 2. 1 occur moat of the mantras referred to by 
Ap. under agnySdheya. 

2238. Several rules are laid down about the oboosing of the place 
of worship (devayajana) in Sat. Br. III. 1. 1, Ait. Br. I. 8, DrBhyS- 
yaoa 8r. 1. 1. 14-19 &o. It should be the highest place and in its 
vicinity there should be no spot whioh is on a higher level than it, it 
should be even and firm and incline towards the east or north, being 
a little higher in the south. It should have many plants growing on 
it and in front of it there should be water (a well &o.) or a large tree 
or a public road. The t^at. Br. III. 1. 1. 6 emphasizes that if one 
secures learned and skilful priests it does not matter what kind of 
sacrificial ground one selects. The Ait. Br. I. 3 requires that the 
diksita is to walk about and sit usually in the devayajana, and he must 
not leave it at all at sunrise, sunset and when priests are engaged in 
ukavana (saying '0 sraVaya'). Vide Sffyana on Tai. S. I. 2. 1 for 
yajnasBlB and com. on Est. VII. 1. 19-24 for the same. The yajfla- 
e"SlB is oalled ' dlksitavimita ' in the Ait. Br. I. 3 and it is the same as 
prScInavamsa-SslB. Isfis are performed in the pritoInavamda-s'RlB, but 
the Uttaravedi required in animal, soma and some other sacrifices is 
outside it. Furthor rules are given under Agnistonia.

paniment of the mantra ' sam no devlr * ( R,g. X. 9. 4=Tai. Br. 
I. 2. 1 ), and constructs a shed having the end of the principal 
bamhoo or ridge turned northwards or eastwards. Beneath the 
middle of the ridge of the hut towards one end is the place 
( ayatana ) meant for the garhapatya fire ; the place of the 
fihavanlya fire is to the east of the garhapatya at a distance of 
eight prakramas'"* for a brahmana, eleven and twelve for a 
ksatriya and vaisya respectively or all may have it 24 steps 
( pada ) or at a distanoe found by the eye to approximate to 
the distances stated ( without actual measurement ). The place 
for the daksinagni is near the garhapatya to the south-east after 
a third of the distance between the garhapatya and ahavanlya. 
There are to be separate sheds for the ahavanlya fire and the 
garhapatya in elaborate sacrifices but for the ordinary sacrifices 
like darsapQrnamSsa one shed only is usually constructed which 
houses all the three fires. It is laid down that only Vedic rites 
are to be performed with the three fires, and that they were not 
to be used for ordinary cooking or for secular purposes ( vide 
Jaimini XII. 2. 1-7 ). The sabhya fire, is to be established in 
front of the ahavanlya in the gambling hall and the avasathya 
fire is in a shed ( for guests ) to the east of the sabhya. 3240 

The sacrificer gets the hair on the head and face shaved, 
pares his nails and then bathes ; the wife also does the same 
except shaving the hair on the head. The husband and wife 
are to establish fires after wearing two silken garments each, 
which are to be given up to the adhvaryu at the time of distri- 
buting daksina ( after the rite of agnyadheya is finished ). The 
aaorificer should perform the safhkalpa (words indicating resolve) 
of performing agnyadheya and choose his priests (rtvig-varana) 

2239. According to the com. on 5p. V. 4. 3 aprakrama is equal to 
two or three jpadas, a pada being 15 angulas (Baud.) or 12 afigulas (Kst.). 
But the com. on Kst. VIII. 3. 14 says that a pada is equal to two 
prakramas. The gSrhapatya was also called prSjahita (vido Jaimini 
XII. 1.13) and the DakstnSgni was called anvlthffryapacana, bccauso 
on it was cooked the boiled rice with which piuda-pitryajfia was 
performed on the new moon. Vide Manu III. 123, Tai. Br. I. 1. 10 and 
' %f%F»rrw rra*rrf I$ T5rf&' quoted by ?!** on ^. XII. 2. 3. 

2240. The com. on ip. V. 17. 1 notioes divergent views about 
sabhya and Kvasathya fires, some holding that these were not to be 
established at all, others holding that they are optional, while Ap. 
makes them obligatory.

by touohing their hands with appropriate mantras and offer 
them madhuparka ( vide Ap. X 1. 13-14 for the mantras 
' agnir-me hots &c). In the afternoon or when the sun is over 
the trees the adhvaryu should fetch a portion of fire from the 
aupasana ( grhya fire ) and kindle a fire called brahmaudanika 
( one prepared for brahmaudana ) "*' to the west of the place 
for the garhapatya or he may take up the whole of the aupasana 
fire ( of the y ajamana ) or he may generate fire by attrition. He 
should prepare a sthandila ( an altar of sand &c.) and should 
draw thereon three lines from west to east and three lines from 
south to north and should sprinkle water on the sthandila and 
then he should bring burning coals from the aupasana fire 
and place them on the lines so drawn. If he takes up the 
whole of the aupasana fire, then he should take on two leaves 
of udumbara a oake of barley flour and another of rioe and 
should throw on the place of the brahmaudanika fire the barley 
cake to the west and the rioe cake to the east and then establish 
tbe fire thereon. The adhvaryu puts apart at night to the 
west of the brahmaudanika fire on the red hide of a bull having 
the neck part to the east and the hair outside or on a bamboo 
utensil four dishfuls of rice 2242 grains after repeating the mantra 
' devasya' and with the words ' I set apart what is pleasing to 
prfina that is brahman,' which are repeated four times ( with 
prana, apana, vyana and lastly with brahman only ) or he may 
do so silently. He cooks the grains ( of rice or barley ) in four 
vessels filled with water, he does not cleanse the rice grains 
with his hand after pouring them into the water, nor does he 
drain off the water while cooking ; some cook the grains in 
milk. From the cooked food ( the brahmaudana ) he takes 
some in a spoon ( darvl ) and offers it into (the brahmaudanika) 
fire with the mantra ' pra vedhase kavaye ' ( Rg. V. 15. 1 = 
Tai. Br. I. 2. 1 ). He should say ' this is for Brahman ; not 
mine.' Having put the cooked food separately into four dishes 
and pouring plenty of ghee over it, the saorifioer draws the 
plates over the ground towards the priests without letting them 
go and brings them near the four priests who are descendants 
of illustrious sages. The remaining portion of the brahmaudana

is drawn out of the pots, the rest of the clarified butter is poured 
over it and three samidhs of a citriya m * asvattha that are wet 
( not dry ), that are a span in length and have on them their 
leaves and fruits are dipped therein and turned about therein 
with a mantra and then they are put on the fire to the accom- 
paniment of three gayatrls ( addressed to Agni ) for brahmanas, 
three Tristubhs for ksatriyas and three Jagatls for vaisyas ( the 
verses are set out in Ap. V. 6. 3 ). 

When the samidhs are offered into fire he ( sacrifioer ) gives 
three heifers to the adhvaryu and a similar number to each of the 
brahmanas who eat the brahmaudana. This brahmaudana along 
with the gifts of heifers and offering of samidhs may be performed 
daily for one year before the date of agnyadhana. These samidhs 
must be offered by everyone intending to set up the three 
sacred fires 12 days, three days, two days or a day before 
the day of agnyadheya. He (saorifioer) has to keep certain 
observances viz. he does not partake of flesh, does not cohabiti 
others do not take away fire from his house ; he subsists ( for 
three days ) only on milk or on boiled rice, he has to speak the 
truth and to avoid sleeping on a cot. If for some reason the 
sacrifioer is unable to perform agnyadheya in a year (or 12 days 
&c.) from the time he offered brahmaudana he should again 
cook brahmaudana, offer the samidhs and then should perform 
agnyadhana when he can do so. 2244 On the night previous to 
the day of agnyadhana the adhvaryu (according to Bharadvaja, 
all the priests) keeps certain observances viz. he does not eat 
flesh nor does he approach his wife. 

On that night a goat having dark spots on its skin is tied 
towards the north of the place for the garhapatya fire with a 
mantra *praj&' agne &c. \ The yajamfina observes avow of 
silence on that night and people keep him awake that night by 
playing upon a lute and a flute ( but there is an option viz. he 
may not keep awake nor observe silence). The sacrificer 
remains awake the whole of that night placing pieces of wood 
on the brfthmaudanika fire with the verse ' salkair-agnim &c. * 
( but if he does not keep awake he heaps on the fire logs of wood

at one time and then goes to sleep ).' m At day-break the 
adhvaryu heats the two aranis against that fire with two verses 
' jatavedo bhuvanasya &o. ' and ' ayam te yonir-rtviyah ' ( both 
in Tai Br. I. 2.1). Then the brahmaudanika fire is extin- 
guished, the two aranis are invoked with the verse 'agnl 
raksSrhsi ' and the yajamSna keeps waiting for the aranis that 
are brought with the verse 'mahl vispatnL' The adhvaryu 
hands over the aranis to the sacrifioer with the verse ' dohyS ca 
te', who receives them with a verse and immediately invokes 
them with two verses. Both (adhvaryu and yajamSna) repeat 
in a low voice the formula 'mayi grhnSmyagre &c. '. The 
adhvaryu arranges the place for the gSrhapatya with the verse 
'apeta vita* and sprinkles it with water with ' sam no devlr. ' 
He does the same for the places ( ayatanas ) of the daksina fire 
( to the south-east ) and of Shavanlya, sabhya and Svasathya 
fires. Even since ancient times there have been agnihotrins 
who did not set up the sabhya and Svasathya fires. Half of the 
sand ( that has already been brought among the sarribharaa ) is 
divided into two parts, one ( i. e. \ of the whole heap ) being 
scattered over the plaoe of the garhapatya and the other ( } ) 
over the place of the daksinagni. The other half of the sand 
heap is divided into three parts each of which is soattered in 
the places of the other three, Shavanlya, sabhya and Svasathya 
( but if no sabhya nor Svasathya is to be kept then the half is 
entirely scattered over the Shavanlya place ). In the same way 
the other earthy materials are placed over the places of the fires 
with appropriate mantras. After he places the lime stones or 
pebbles on the various places he brings to his mind his enemy. 
Then he spreads the various materials on the fire places and after 
mixing together the materials of wood to the accompaniment of 
two mantras he scatters them just as he soattered the sand 
(after dividing them as stated above). He oasts to the 
north over the materials a piece of gold on the place of 
the gSrhapatya 824 * and invokes it with a mantra and 
assigns at a distance a pieoe of silver for his enemy or throws 
it into water if he has no enemy. The same process ( of 
casting a golden piece ) is followed as to the plaoes of the other 
fires. He removes the ashes of the brShmaudanika fire (that

deposits the two aranis from which he produoes fire by drilling. 
When the first we of the sun spread in the sky ( i. e. before the 
sun's diso is seen, but the eastern horizon is lit up by rays ) he 
planes the upper arani on the lower one to the accompaniment 
of the ' dasa-hotr'"* 7 formulae. While generation of fire by 
attrition is proceeding a white or red horse from whose eyes no 
water drops ( i. e. who is not blear-eyed ) and whose knee is 
dark ( or any horse with full testicles ) is kept present and a 
soman of Sakti Sahkrti is sung ; when smoke rises a saman of 
Gathina Kausika is sung and also the verse ' aranyor-nihito ' 
( Rg. III. 29. 2 ). 

He ( the adhvaryu ) invokes the fire with the mantra ' upa- 
varoha jatavedah ' ( Tai. Br. II. 5. 8 ) the moment it is produced. 
Then the adhvaryu makes the sacrificer recite the catur-hotf 
(mantras)" 48 and invokes the fire when kindled with the 
mantra ' ajannagnih '. When the fire is produced the yajamana 
bestows on the adhvaryu the most desirable fee ( i. e. a oow ), 
which he accepts with a mantra. After the fire is produced, the 
yajamana breathes over it with the formula ' prajapatistva ' 
(Tai. S. IV. 2. 9.1). The adhvaryu holds over the fire his 
folded hands turned downwards with a verse, makes it blaze forth 
by means of fuel-sticks with the words ' samradasi ' ( Tai. S. 
IV. 3. 6. 2 ), holds it in his folded hands turned upwards, Bits 
down on a seat and while the Rathantara and YajSayajfiiya 
samans are being chanted, he establishes the garhapatya fire on 
the sambharas ( the earthy and wooden materials scattered as 
above ) by repeating certain mantras according as the saorifioer

bhtth ) or the first two vyabrtis ( bhQh, bhuvah ), the first two 
Sarparajnl formulae and the first of the Ghannasiras texts. The 
formula for establishing the g&rhapatya according to the gotra 
is stated in note 2249. When establishing the gSrhapatya on the 
sambhSraa the adhvaryu further repeats certain mantras ( given 
in Ap. 6r. V.12. 2 ) and then the yajamSna invokes the fires with 
the mantra ' sugsrhapatyo ' ( Tai. Br. 1. 2. 1 ) a nd the adhvaryu 
makes the yajamana repeat the Gharmasiras formulae. The 
adhvaryu strews darbhas round the gS-hapatya ( i. e. he does 
paristarana ). 

The procedure for establishing the ahavanlya is to be so 
arranged that the fire is aotually established when half of the 
sun's diso rises above the eastern horizon. The adhvaryu lights 
fuel-sticks on the garhapatya for being carried forward and 
he takes in a vessel the sand on whioh fire would be supported 
to the accompaniment of four verses. Then while carrying the 
fire, he raises a little the kindled bundle of fuel-sticks and 
holds the fire on the sand. Then the adhvaryu makes the yaja- 
mSna repeat in the right ear of the horse the Agnitanu formulse 
( set out in Ap. Sr. V. 13. 7 ), holds the fire for some time and 
then lays it down in the place for the ahavanlya.

The Agnldhra priest then brings domestic fire or produces 
fire by attrition, sits down with his knees raised up, and establi- 
shes the daksinagni, while the Yajnayajniya s&man is being 
chanted and follows the procedure of repeating formulae 
according to the gotra ( as above ) and repeats the 2nd vyahrti 
( bhuvah ), the three Sarparajfil formulae and the 2nd Gharma- 

siras(viz. the verse ' vafcah. paca'). After repeating 

several other formulae ( as in Ap. Sr. V. 13. 8 ) he sets down 
daksina fire on the sambharas. 

The fire brought for establishing 88 *° daksina fire may be 
fetched from the house of a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaisya or a 
sudra who is extremely prosperous like an asura ( if the sacri- 
ficer desires prosperity ), but he should thereafter never eat 
at that man's house ; or ( according to Baud. Sr. II. 17 ) it may 
be brought from the garhapatya fire or according to Asv. from 
the house of a vaisya or of any rich man or it may be produced 
by attrition. 

When the ahavanlya fire is being taken ( in a vessel ) from 
the garhapatya the Vamadevya is chanted and they proceed to- 
wards the east preceded by the horse, 2351 repeating three mantras. 
To the south of the vihara the brahma priest makes a ohariot 
or a chariot wheel move up till three revolutions of the wheel 
take place ( six times for an enemy ). A third part of the 
distanoe ( between the garhapatya and the place for ahavanlya ) 
the fire is carried at the height of the knee, the 2nd third at the 
height of the navel, the last third at the height of the mouth. 
No one is to come between the sun and the fire. He takes the 
fire with both his hands stretched to the right. In the middle 
of the distanoe the yajamana gives a gift to the priest. In 
the middle of the distance the adhvaryu puts down a pieoe of 
gold and then crosses over it with the mantra ' nakosi.' The 
adhvaryu makes the horse that faoes the east go over the earn- 
bharas to their north with its right hoof placed in such a way 
that the live ooals of the fire when established would fall on the 
foot-print made by the horse and making the horse turn to its 
right he again makes the horse go over the sambharas with 
a formula ' yadakrandah ' ( Kg. 1. 163. 1 ). The horse is held

ing to Vftjasaneyaka). Then the saorificer mutters auspicious

' go to him, O fire, with thy terrible forms. ' Having invoked 
the fire with the verse ' Yad-idam divah * ( Tai. Br. I. 2. 1 ) he 
turning his face to the west and standing to the east establishes 
the ahavanlya fire. Tbe ahavanlya is laid down upon the 
sambharas when the Brhat Saman, the Syaita, Varavantlya and 
Yajnayajniya are being chanted, and the procedure of repeating 
consecrating mantras aocording to gotra is being followed, when 
all the vy&hrtis, all the Sarpa-rajml mantras, the tbird Gharma- 
siras formula and certain other verses are recited."" The saorificer 
invokes the ahavanlya when it is being established with the 
formula ' anase &c. ' ( which ocours in Tai. Br. 1. 1. 7 ) and he 
follows the priest ( whether adhvaryu or Sgnldhra ) in repeating 
the various vyahrtis, the Sarparajfil verse's and the Gharmasiras 
formulae. The fire when established should be propitiated with 
clarified butter and plants ( i. e. fuel-sticks ) after repeating 
certain formula? (set out in 2Lp. V. 16. 4). The samans are sung

rule to be chanted loudly, in sdhSna they are to be uttered inaudibly 
( upBrnsu ), since SdhSna is to be done with yajurveda procedure.

ahavanlya, aooording to the mode of establishment dependent 
on the gotra as stated above. He puts on each fire three samidhs 
of the asvattha tree with three versea ( Rg. IX. 66. 19, 21, 20 ) 
and three samidhs of saml smeared with ghee after repeating 
certain mantras ( $g. IV. 58. 1-3 ). Or these samidhs may be 
offered in the ahavanlya ( if sabhya and avasathya are not 
kept up ). 

Then he offers a purn&huti, MW the Baorifioer gives gifts, 
mutters certain auspicious formulae, waits in worship upon the 
five ( or three ) fires. Then if the yajamana is a ksatriya dice 
play takes place. The gifts given to all the four priests are 
cloth, a cow and bull, and a new chariot, while a goat, purna- 
patra and a pillow of several coloured threads are given to the 
agnldhra, a horse to brahmS, a bull to adhvaryu, and a dhenu 
to the hotr. There are larger gifts specified aooording to the 
saorificer's ability. 

K8t. ( IV. 10. 16 ) ordains that after establishing the Vedic 
fires the yajamana should observe complete celibacy for 12 
nights, 6 nights or at least three nights, should sleep near the 
fires on the ground ( and not on a cot ), should offer homa of 
milk to the fires. Baud. II. 20 prescribes further observances for 
twelve days. 

Punarndheya : When within a year after a man sets up 
the Vedio fires he suffers from severe illness ( such as dropsy ) 
or suffers loss of wealth or his son dies or his near relatives are 
harassed or made captive by his enemies or he beoomes cripple 
in a limb, or if he is desirous of prosperity or fame he again 
sets up the fires. The procedure is essentially the same as for 
agnyfidheya with a few differences e. g. fires are fed with kusa 



2255. The com. on KSt. IV. 10. 5 explains j;onn WZ1 stiffs 
Soffit'. The procedure ordinarily applying to all Shutis of clarified 
butter iis The adhvaryu puts butter into the butter-pot, which is 
placed en the gSrhapatya fire to melt. Having wiped the eruva (dipp- 
ing spoon) and juha (offering spoon) with darbha grass and having 
taken the butter pot off the fire he dips two darbha blades used as 
strainers (pavitra ) into the heated butter and fills the juhu with the 
sruva. Then he takes a mmidh, walks over to the north side of the 
ahavanlya, strews darbha grass round it and puts the samidh on that 
fire. Then he sits down with bent right knee, pours the butter in the 
juhB on to the fire with the word svShS and the sacrificer utters the 
formula 'agnaya idam na mama '. This holds good in agnySdheya and 
agnihotra, bat in many other rites the principal (pradhBna) offerings 
are offered while the priest is standing. 



§98 History of DharmaiMra I Oh. XXIX 

grass and not with wood nor with fuel-sticks, the two ajyabha- 
gas are for agni alone ( while in the model sacrifice they are 
for Agni and Soma ), the punaradheya is performed in the rainy 
season and at mid-day. Other differences and details are 
passed over. UH Jai. ( VI. 4. 26-27 ) states that punaradheya is 
a prSyascitta only if both the fires ( g&rhapatya and Shavanlya ) 
have been extinguished or discontinued and ( in X 3. 30-33 ) 
that when punaradheya is resorted to for some desired object, the 
fees that are prescribed in agny&dhana are not the fees to be 
given, but other daksina is given. 

Agnihotra 

According to Gau. VIII. 20 there are seven forms of 
haviryajnas of which agnihotra is the second. From the 
evening of the day of agnyadheya the house-holder has to 
perform agnihotra" 57 ( burnt offering of cow's milk &o. ) twice 
daily in the evening and morning to the end of his life 
or till he becomes a samnySsin, or as the Sat. Br. ( XII. 4. 1. 1 ) 
says 'Those who offer agnihotra indeed enter upon a long 
sacrificial session ; agnihotra indeed is a sattra that ends with 
old age or death, since he becomes free from it only by old age 
or death.' Satyfis&dha prescribes ( III. 1 ) that from the time 
of setting up the three srauta fires, agnihotra and darsapurna- 
m&sa are obligatory on all members of the twice-born classes 
and he holds that the nisSda and rathakara also are bound to 
perform them, though other sutrakaras are opposed to this. Vide 
pp. 45-47 above. Jai. ( VI. 3. 1-7 and 8-10 ) holds that agni- 
hotra being obligatory, it may be undertaken even by him who 
is not able to perform every detail of it in its entirety, but that 
a kSmya rite should be undertaken only by him who is able to 
carry out every detail. Vide also Jai. II, 4, 1-7 where ' yavaj- 
jlvam-agnihotram juhoti ' is explained as laying down a

characteristic required of the performer. The several sutras 
present differing details and mantras. 2258 According to one 
view all the three fires are permanently maintained by the 
house-holder "" ( Kat. IV. 13. 5 ) ; according to others only the 
garhapatya is permanently kept ( Ap. VI. 2. 13) and the daksi- 
nagni is permanently kept only if it was set up by attrition at 
the time when the house-holder performed agnyadheya. The 
house-holder calls upon the adhvaryu to bring the ahavanlya 
from the garhapatya in the evening and also in the morning ; this 
is so only if the yajamana engages an adhvaryu in the daily 
agnihotra, but if the yajamana does the daily agnihotra himself 
this call is unnecessary. As to the daksinagni in the daily 
agnihotra, Asv. ( II. 2. 1 ) mentions several alternatives viz., it 
may be brought from the house of a vaisya or from the 
house of any rich man or it may be produced by attrition or 
it may be kindled into flames if it is kept permanently. He 
should take burning coals from the kindled garhapatya in 
a vessel and carry them to the place of the ahavanlya 
with the mantra ' devam tva devebhyah sriya uddharami ' and 
should repeat when carrying the burning coals towards the east 
the mantra ' raise me up from sin that I knowingly or unknow- 
ingly may have committed ; save me from all the sin that 
I may have committed in the day ' ( this in the evening agni- 
hotra, in the morning agnihotra it being said ' sin that I 
committed at night ' ). Vide Asv. II. 2. 3 and 6, Ap. VI. 1. 7, 
Baud. III. 4. He should face the sun and place the burning 
coals in the ahavanlya mound with the mantra ( amrtahutim 
&o, in Asv. II. 2. 4, Ap. VI. 1. 8, Baud. III. 4 ). In the morning 
agnihotra also he should face the sun and do other things 
stated above. According to Eat. ( IV. 13. 2 ) the evening agni- 
hotra is to ba commenced before the sun sets and the morning 
one before the sun rises. Asv. says that the homa is performed

after the sun sets. There have been two views on this point 
from very anoient times viz. whether agnihotra is to be performed 
before sunrise or after sunrise. Vide Ait Br. 24. 4-6 and 
Kausltaki Br. II. 9. Ap. ( VI. 4. 7-9 ) mentions four views as to 
both evening or morning time for agnihotra viz. it should be the 
sa/hdhi of day and night for both or it may be when the first 
star is seen or in the first watoh of the night or in the 2nd ( for 
evening agnihotra) and at dawn, or when a part of the disc of 
the sun just appears on the horizon or after the sun comes up. 
The householder performs agnihotra after finishing his aafhdhya 
adoration. There is a difference of opinion, some holding that 
the homa in the grhya fire should precede the agnihotra in the 
Vedic fires, while others hold that it should come after the 
Vedic agnihotra."' The house-holder after performing sarhdhya 
follows either of two modes ( Kat. IV. 13. 12 and IV 15. 2, Ap. 
VI. 5. 3, according to his sakha ), goes towards the ahavanlya 
through the space between the plaoes of the garhapatya and 
daksinSgni or by a route to the south of these two fire places 
and having gone round the ahavanlya sits down to the south 
in his usual place ( or orosses from the western side of the 
ahavanlya and sits down to its south ) and the wife also sits 
in her place ( Kat. IV. 13. 13, Ap. VI. 5. 1-2 ). The householder 
then sips water (performs acamcmd) with the words ' vidyudasi 
vidya me pSpmanam-rtat satyam-upaimi mayi sraddhs' ( Ap. 
VI. 5. 3 ). The wife also sips water. 58 " Then both husband and 
wife should observe silence till the agnihotra (morning or 
evening ) is gone through. A man who has no wife can perform 
the daily agnihotra (vide Ait. Br. 32. 8). The adhvaryu performs 
pamamuhana ( wiping with the wet hand from the north-east to 
the north) thrioe for the three fires. He strews round the

gradually the wife lost all importance in Vedio rites and came to be a 
mere silent spectator of all the weary details that had to be gone 
through by the sacrifioer and the priest. Jaimini VI. 1. 17-21 stated 
generally that the husband and wife co-operated in performing yajna, 
butjm Vl. 1. 24 be qualifies the general statement by saying that the 
wife cannot do all the aotions which are to be done by the sacrifioer, but 
only' : those which she is expressly asked to do In the texts.

Shavanlya fire darbha grass ( performs paristarana ) in such a 
way that the darbhas to the east and west have their ends turned 
to the north and. of those to the north and south turned to the east 
and the strewing proceeds from the east, then to the south, then 
to the west and then to the north. In the same way he strews 
darbha grass round the gSrhapatya and then round the daksin- 
Sgni. Taking water in his right hand, he sprinkles it round the 
shavanlya first, beginning from the northeast and ending in 
the north. Then he walks towards the west pouring a conti- 
nuous stream of water from the Shavanlya up to the garhapatya. 
He then sprinkles ( performs paryuksaya ) the garhapatya from 
left to right and then the dakaipagni. Or one may sprinkle water 
( and this is the usual order now in the Deccan ) round the 
gSrhapatya first and then round daksipagni and then pour a 
stream of water from the garhapatya to the east up to the 
Shavanlya ( Asv. II. 2. 14 ). Asv. ( II. 2. 11-13 ) says that the 
mantra in paryuksana is ' rtasatyabhyam tvS paryuksami ' and 
each fire is sprinkled thrice, water being taken freshly at each 
time and the mantra being repeated eaoh time and that sprinkling 
may first be done round the daksipagni, then round gSrhapatya 
and then ahavanlya. Vide Est. IV. 13. 16-18, 5.p. VL 5. 4. 

The homa is performed with cow's milk for him who 
performs agnihotra as a sacred duty and not for any particular 
reward in view, but one who desires to secure a village or 
plenty of food, or strength or brilliance may employ respective- 
ly yavSgu ( gruel ), cooked rice, ourds or clarified butter ( Asv. 
II. 3. 1-2 ). Then an order is issued to the person engaged to 
milk the agnihotra cow" 61 that stands to the south of the sacri- 
ficial ground with her face to the east or north and that has a 
male calf. At the time of milking the oalf is to the south of 
the cow, and first sucks milk and then the oalf is removed and 
the milking is done. The person to milk the cow should not be 
a sudra ( K&t. IV. 14. 1 ), but Ap. ( VI. 3. 11-14 ) allows even a 
sudra to milk the cow, while Baud, ( III. 4 ) says that he must 
be a brShmana. Rules are laid down about the udders from 
whioh milk is to be drawn and about persons for whom it is to 
be drawn ( Sat. III. 7 based on Tai. Br. II. 1. 8 ). The milking 
is not to be begun by pressing the udders, but by making the 

2262. Tai. Br. II. 1. 6 identifies the oow with agnihotra and 
II. 1.7 states that the cow's milk in its various stages belongs to various 
deities sinoe the time it is in the udder (when it is Raudra) till after 
it is offered (when it is dear to Indra).

calf suok them first ( na stanan sammrsati ' Ap. VI. 4. 2 based 
on Tai. Br. II. 1. 8 ). Milking is to be begun the moment the 
sun sets ( Ap. YI. 4. 5 ). The vessel in which the milk is to be 
held is of earthenware manufactured by an Srya ( i. e. one who 
belongs to the three regenerate classes ), but without using a 
wheel and the vessel must have a wide mouth and straight sides 
and not slanting ones ( Eat. IV. 14. 1, Ap. VI. 3. 7 ). It is called 
agnihotrasthall (Ap. VI. 3. 15). The adhvaryu takes from the 
garhapatya fire some burning ooals for boiling the milk and 
keeps them to the north of the garhapatya in a separate spot. 
Then he goes near the cow, holds the vessel in whioh the 
oow has been milked, brings it towards the east of the 
fthavanlya, sits to the west of the garhapatya and heats the 
vessel on the burning coals mentioned above. He takes a 
darbha blade ( other than one of those that are strewn round the 
garhapatya ), kindles it and holding it over the milk illumi- 
nates the milk with its light. He then takes water in a sruva 
and sprinkles one drop or some drops into the boiling milk 
( Asv. II. 3. 3 and 5 ). He should then again hold a burning 
blade ( the Bame blade used before ) over the hot milk and light 
it up. He does this thrice and then casts away the blade to the 
north. ,,M There was a difference of view whether the milk to 
be offered should be brought to the boiling point or should only 
be simply hot ( vide Sat. Br. II. 3. 1. 14-16 and com. on Kat. 
IV. 14. 5 ). Then the pot of milk is slowly lifted with three 
mantras and drawn down to the north from the burning coals 
(Asv. II. 3. 8, Tai. Br. II. 1. 3 'vartma karoti'). Then the 
burning coals on whioh the milk was boiled or heated are 
thrown back in the garhapatya fire. Then a sruva and sruc 
both made of vikankata wood are cleaned with the hand ( to 
remove dust ) and are heated on the garhapatya ( or ahavanlya 
according to Ap. VI. 7. 1 ). He then again heats the sruc and 
sruva on the garhapatya, asks the yajam&na ' shall I take out 
milk from the pot" 6 * with the sruva)' and the yajamSna 

2263. The Tai. Br. II. 1. 3 says *tfr*T4jrem fawnftsnin} I *tm*. 

wtift i ... srtWurft i ... fih <pF8hfritfih _ T*fWfaOTnnrfih . The 

sprinkling of water from the sruva on the milk is called pratiseka 
(Ip. VI. 6. 3-4). This is referred to in Tai. Br. II. 1. 3. The sruo 
with whioh agnlhotra is offered is oailed agnibotra-havanl, whiob is 
made of yikaikafa wood, is as long as one's arm or aratni (ip. VI. 3. 6 
and com. thereon). 

2264. £p. VI. 7. 1 states that words addressed by the adhvaryu differ

replies standing * Yes, do take out '. Then the adhvaryu holds 
in his right hand the sruva ladle and in his left hand the 
agnihotra-hava?! with its mouth turned upwards, pours out into 
the agnihotra-havanl milk from the milk pot (already heated) 
with the Bruva four times nti and keeps the sruva in the milk 
pot. In Ap. VI. 7. 7-8 and Asv. II. 3. 13-14 it is said that the 
adhvaryu knowing the mind of the householder should draw 
the fullest ladle for the most favourite son of the saorifloer or 
if the latter desires that the eldest son should be most pro- 
sperous and the later ones less and less, then the first ladle is 
filled to the fullest; on the other hand if he wishes the 
youngest to be prosperous then the last ladle drawing is the 
fullest. Then the adhvaryu carrying a samidh of palasa wood 
a span in length over the rod of the sruo (inserting his 
finger between the two), holds the two together over the g&rha- 
patya very near its flames, carries the sruc towards the 
ahavanlya holding it as high as his nose ; when in the midst 
of the distance between the garhapatya and the ahavanlya, 
he brings the sruc down ( to the level of his navel ) and then 
again raising it up as high as his mouth, ho reaches the ahava- 
nlya and places the sruc and samidh on darbha blades ( on the 
kurca, says Baud. III. 5 ) to the west of the ahavanlya. He 
himself Bits to the northwest of the ahavanlya faoing the east, 
bends his knees, holds the sruo in his left hand and with the 
right hand offers the samidh 2!M in the midBt of the ahavanlya 
fire with the mantra ' rajatam tvagnijyotisam ' (according to Asv. 
II. 3. 15 ). Then he sips water with the mantra ' vidyud-asi 
vidya me papmSnam-rtat-satyam-upaimi ' (Ap. VI. 9. 3, Asv. 

II. 7. 16). When the samidh has caught fire and is burning 
brightly, he offers the first oblation (of milk) on the samidh 
about two finger-breadths from its root with the mantra ' om 
bhur-bhuvah-svarom, agnirjyotir jyotiragnih svaha' ( VSj. S. 

III. 9 ). Aocording to Kat. he may optionally repeat the mantra 

2265. Milk is poured five times for those who are oalled pa£o5- 
vattins such as householders whose gotra is Jamadagni ( Sp. VI. 8. 2 ). 
According to BaudhSyana (pravarSdhyBya 5) Vatsas, Bidas and Xrs|i- 
senas are paflcBvattins. Ap. sets out the fire mantras repeated at eaob 
of the fire times when milk is poured with the sruva. 



The mantras differ according to the antra. Aocording to 
Ap. VI. 9. 3 one samidh or two or three may be offered and he prescribes 
different mantras for the three. The Tai. Br. II. 1. 8 upholds the 
offering of only one samidh.

in the evening agnihotra the mantra is ' agnirjyotir ' &o ; while 
in the morning agnihotra it is 'suryo jyotir-jyotih suryah 
Bvfthft* (Vsj. S. Ill 9 ). Then he places the sruc on the kusa 
blades and looks at the garhapatya with the thought ' bestow 
on me cattle '. Then be again takes up the sruc, makes a 
second offering (of milk) whioh is larger in measure than the 
first one, but this is offered silently, while he contemplates 
upon PrajSpati in his mind"' 8 . This second offering is made 
to the east or north of the first in such a way that the two 
will not oome in contact. He keeps more milk in the sruo than 
what is taken up in making the second offering. He then raises 
the sruo twice (thrice according to Ap. VI. 11. 3 ) in such 
a way that the flames of the fire turn north-wards and places 
the sruc on the kurca. He scours with his hand turned down- 
wards the spout of the ladle and then rubs his hand to which 
some drops of the milk stick on the north side of the kurca 
( the points of the kusas that are towards the north ) with 
the words ' salutation to the gods ' ( Kat. IV. 14. 20 ) or ' to you 
for securing oattle'. Ap. ( VI. 10. 10 ) says that he scours in 
the evening the sruc ( in order to remove what sticks to it ) 
from the end of the handle down to the bowl with the man- 
tra ' ise tva ' ( Tai. S. I. 1. 1. 1. ) and in the morning from 
the bowl to the end of the ladle with the mantra ' urje tv5 ' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 1. 1 ). Then while the palm is turned upwards, 
and while he wears his sacred thread in the prSdnavIta mode 
he places his fingers to the south of the roots of the kusa blades 
on the ground silently or with the mantra ' svadha pitrbhyah * 
( Kat. IV. 14. 21 and Asv. II. 3. 21 ) or * svadha pitrbhyah pitrin 
jinva ( Ap. VI. 11. 4 ). Then he sips water ( but with the sacred 
thread in the upavlta form ) with his face turned to the east. 
Then he walks to the plaoe of the garhapatya, takes a fuel-stick 
( samidh ) in his hand while standing. He then sits down to the

oblation of milk by the sruva silently according to Kat. ( IV. 
14. 24 ) or with the words ' bhurbhuvah. svah suprajah prajabhih 
sy&m suvlro vlraih suposah posaih ' and with at least any three 
verses addressed to Agni and with the verses ' agna ayurhsi 
pavase * $g. IX. 66. 19-21 ( according to As v. II. 3. 27-29 ). 
Then he offers one oblation of milk with the sruva ladle into the 
daksinagni with the words ' annadayanna-pataye svSha ' and a 
second one silently. He then touches water, turns northwards 
and with one of his fingers ( with the ring finger ' an&mika ' 
according to Kat. IV. 14. 26 ) he takes out what remains in the 
sruc and lioks it noiselessly without allowing it to come in 
contact with his teeth. He then sips water and lioks it a 
second time and then sips water. He then takes into another 
vessel or on his own palm all remnants ( of milk &o. ) in the 
sruo and licks the contents of the vessel or his palm once with 
his tongue. According to Ap. ( VI. 11. 5 and VI. 12. 2 ) and 
Baud. III. 6 he holds the sruo in such a way that its rod is 
turned east or north, and licks mi the sruo itself twice, fills it 
with water, pours down to the west the water ( from the ladle ) 
with the mantra ' propitiate those who partake of leavings', 
sips water, and wipes the agnihotrahavanl with darbha blades. 
Then he washes his hand, performs acamana twice, goes near 
the ahavanlya, sits down, fills the sruo with water and spills 
the water from the ladle to the north of the ahavanlya with the 
words ' devSn jinva; ' he repeats the same process again and 
wearing the sacred thread in the praclnavlta form and turning 
to the south he pours water to the south of the ahavanlya for the 
pitrs with the words ' pitfn jinva '. He then repeats the same 
prooess as for gods and sprinkles water upwards in the north-east 
a third time with the words * sapta-raln jinva '. He fills the 
sruo a fourth time, removes the darbhas from the place ( kurca- 
sthana) where they were placed to the west of the ahavanlya,

pours down water on that place thrice, so as to end the stream 
in the east or north. He then heats the sruo and sruva on the 
ahavanlya fire together and keeps them on the antarvedi or 
hands them over to an attendant. He then offers three 
samidhs to each of the three fires in the order in which he 
performed paryuksana ( i. e. in the order ahavanlya, gSrhapatya, 
daksinagni, or garhapatya, daksin&gni, ahavanlya ). After this 
the house-holder engages in waiting upon agni with vdtsapra 
prayers or in a brief worship by repeating only ' bhurbhuvah 
svah &c.' ( Vaj. III. 37 ) ; then he pays silent homage to the 
ahavanlya and sits near it for a moment; then he sleeps or 
sits near the garhapatya ; then he performs paryuksana for all 
the fires, then the householder breaks silence and performs 
aoamana and then when he goes out be contemplates in mind 
the daksjpagni. The wife also performs acamana ( at the end ) 
silently. 

According to Kst. ( IV. 12. 1-2 ) the upasthana ( worship or 
homage ) of the fires in the evening after oblations are offered 
in agnihotra with the Vatsapra mantras ( Vaj. S. III. 11. 36 
and Sat. Br. II. 3. 4. 9-41 ) is optional and the householder may 
simply repeat one verse ( Vaj, S. III. 37 and 6at. Br. II. 4. 1. 
1-2 ). Ap. ( VI. 16. 4 and 6 ) prescribes as upasthana the six 
verses ' upaprayanto * ( Tai. S, I. 5. 5 ) and several others, which 
are passed over for want of space. There were several views 
about upasthana, some holding that upasthana was to be per- 
formed only in the evening and not in the morning, others 
holding that it was to be performed at both times but only with 
the Vatsapra mantras ( Rg. X. 45 ) or with the GosQkta ( $g. 
VI. 28 ) or Asvasukta ( Bg. I. 163 ). Vide Ap. VI. 19. 4-9 to 
VI. 23. 

Ap. ( VI. 15. 10-13 ) has certain interesting rules about agni- 
hotra in the case of ksatriyas. At first he says a ksatriya 
should permanently maintain the ahavanlya fire, but he does 
not perform the daily agnihotra. He should however send food 
from his house to a brahmana at the time when the agnihotra 
homa is ordinarily performed, whereby he secures the perfor- 
mance of agnihotra, but the adhvaryu should make the rajanya 
reoite the mantras of the worship of fire ( agnyupastbana noted 
above ). A rajanya however who has performed somayaga and 
always speaks the truth may perform agnihotra daily. As v. 
( II. 1. 3-5 ) says that a ksatriya ( and a vaisya ) may perform 
agnihotra on the New Moon and Full Moon days, that on other 



Oh. XXIX J &rauta Sacrifices- Agnihotra 1007 

days he should send cooked food to a brShmana who is devoted 
to his duties and that a ksatriya or vaisya who always abides 
by truth ( in thought and word ) and has offered a soma sacri- 
fice may engage in daily agnihotra. It is probable that these 
rules were made to allow more time to ksatriyas and vaisyas 
for their chief occupations. Acoording to Ap. VI. 15. 14-16, 
Asv. IL 4. 2-4 and others the householder Bhould every day 
personally perform the agnihotra, but if he oannot do that, he 
must do it personally at least on parva days and on other days 
a priest, a pupil or a son may perform his agnihotra for him. 

The procedure in the morning agnihotra is the same as the 
evening agnihotra except in a few details e. g. the paryuksana 
mantra in the morning is different in Aav. II. 4. 25 ' satyarta- 
bhy&m tvft paryuksami ', while in the evening it is ' rtasatya- 
bhyftm tvft &o. ' ( Asv. II. 2. 11 ), the samidh is offered into fire 
in the morning with the mantra ' harinlm tva suryajyotisam- 
aharis'tak&m-upadadhe sv&ha ' ( while in the evening the 
mantra is ' rajatatn tvagnijyotisam ratrim-istakam-upadadhe 
svftha ' Asv. II. 4. 25 and II. 3. 15 ); the mantra in offering an 
oblation of milk in the fire in the morning is ' bhurbhuvah- 
svarom, suryo jyotir jyotih suryah svaha', while in the 
evening the word ' agnih ' is substituted for * suryah ' ( Asv. 
II. 4. 25 and II. 3. 16 ). Vide Kit. IV. 15 for further details. 

The sutras set out rules about what the householder is to do 
when he leaves his homa for one night or for a longer period. 
Vide Sat. Br. II. 4. 1. 3-14, Asv. II. 5, Ap, VL 24-27, Est. 
IV. 12. 13-24. According to Asv. the important rules are : he 
kindles the fires into flames, sips water (aoamana) and performs 
the worship of the ahavanlya, garhapatya and dakainigni by 
going near them and repeating respectively the three mantras 
' samsya pasun me pahi \ ' narya prajSm me pahi ' and ' atharva 
pitum me pahi ' (all three in Vaj. S. III. 37). Then while stand- 
ing near the daksinagni he should look at the other two with the 

mantra' imSn me mitravarunau groan gopSyatam punar- 

ftyanSt' (Kanaka S. VII. 3., Mai. S. I. 5. 14, with variations ). 
He then traces the same way back and comes to the ahavanlya 
and offers worship to it with the mantra ' mama nama ' 
( Tai. S. I. 5. 10. 1, quoted in note 553 above). He should then 
start on his journey without looking baok at his fires and 
should mutter the hymn ' ma pranama.' When he reaches a 
place from whioh the roof of his fire-house is not visible he may 
break silence. On reaching the road leading from his house to 



1008 History of DharmaiOstra [ Ch. XXIX 

bis destination he should recite ' sada sugah ' ( Rg. III. 54. 21 ). 
When he returns from his journey to his village, he should 
repeat ' api pantham ' ( Rg. VI. 51. 16 ). He should then observe 
silence, take fuel-stioks in his hand and on learning that his 
fires have been kindled into flames ( by his son or pupil ) he 
should look at the ahavanlya with two verses ( set out in 
-5.SV. II. 5. 9 ). Then placing tbe samidhs he does homage to 
the ahavanlya with the verse ' mama nama tava oa ' ( Tai. S. 
I. 5. 10. 1 ) and then he places samidhs on the ahavanlya, 
g&rhapatya and daksinfigni with one mantra each ( which are 
Vaj. S. III. 28-30 ). 

These rules apply when the house-holder alone goes on a 
journey leaving the wife at home. When the house-holder is 
away alone it is his duty to perform all actions at the time of 
agnihotra and darsapurnamSsa ( such as sipping water ) which 
he can perform without his fires and to go mentally 8no through 
the whole procedure and to observe all vratas (such as subsisting 
on roots and fruits when required ). Vide Ap. IV. 16. 18, 
Est. IV. 12. 16 and com. thereon. When he goes on a journey 
alone he should entrust his fires to his wife and should appoint 
a priest to perform the necessary rites ( vide note 1634 above ). 
When the house-holder starts on a journey accompanied by his 
wife he should take bis fires with him. If both husband and 
wife go on a journey without taking their fires with them, then 
a priest cannot offer the agnihotra homa in their absence and 
on return the house-holder has to again set up the fires ( has to 
perform pumradhana ). mi

CHAPTER XXX 

DARSA-PURNAMASA *» 

The Darsapurnamasa sacrifice is the pattern or arohetype(.pra- 
krti) of all other is^is (which are called vikrtis or modifications). 
The srauta sutras therefore describe first the Darsapurnamasa at 
length, though in the order of time agnyadhana comes first. 
Mv. II. 1. 1 says that all istfs, sacrifices in whioh an animal is 
offered and those in which soma is offered are explained by the 
PaurnamSsa is^i. According to Ap. III. 14. 11-13 a person, 
after he sets up the three fires, has to perform the Darsapurna- 
masa throughout his life ( till he becomes a samnyasin) or for 
thirty years ( after whioh he may stop ) or till he becomes very 
old ( and unable to perform the rite ). ms 

The word ' am&v&syS ' literally means ' the day when ( the 
sun and the moon ) dwell or are together. ' It is that tithi (day) 
on which both the sun and the moon are the nearest to eaoh 
other, while paurnamasl is ' the tithi on whioh the sun and the 
moon are at the greatest distanoe from eaoh "other. ' Purnam&sa 
means ' that moment when the moon is full. ' Daria has the 
same sense as amSv&syS. Darsa is taken to mean ' the day on 
which the moon is seen only by the sun and by no one else. ' 
Darsa ( m ) and purnam&sa ( m ) secondarily mean the rites that 
are performed on the amSvasya and the paurnamasl respec- 
tively." 7 * An iatf means a sacrifice in whioh the saorificer 
employs four priests.

1010 History of DharmaiOatra [ Oh. XXX 

A sketch of the darsapurnamasa isti is given below princi- 
pally based upon the srautasutras of SatySsftdha and Asvalayana. 

One who has performed agnyadheya should begin the 
performance of darsapurnamasa on the first Full Moon day after 
it. The isti on the Full -moon day may occupy two days, but 
all the actions to be performed in it can be compressed into one 
day."™ If extended over two days it is performed on the full 
moon day and the pratipad ( the first day of the dark half that 
follows the Full Moon day ), the former being called upavasaiha 
day" 7 ' and the latter yajaniya day. On the upavasatha day 
aghyanvadhana ( offering fuel-stioks into fire) and paristarana 
are performed in the case of the purnamSsa rite and on the 
yajaniya day the rest is performed. If it is the first purnamSsa 
isti or the first darsa isti, then the sacrificer has to perform the 
Anvarambhanlya istf, whioh is briefly described in the note 
below. ,m 

On the morning of the full moon day the saorificer, after 
the performance of bis daily agnihotra, sitting on a seat of 
darbhas to the west of the gSrhapatya, holding kusa grass in his 
hand and performing pr&nayama and accompanied by his wife, 
makes a samkalpa ( resolve ) as noted below." 78 Then he says 
to the four priests viz., adhvaryu, brahmft, hotr and ftgnldhra

2277. At first two oblations are offered to Barasvatl with two man* 
tras from Tai. S. III. 6. 1. 1. and the anvBrambhanlyS follows. In this a 
cake cooked on eleven potsherds is offered to Agni and Visnu, a earn 
to Barasvatl, a oake on twelve potsherds to Sarasvat and a cake on eight 
potsherds to Agni Bhagin. Jaimini ( IX. 1. 34-36 ) establishes that the 
anvlrambhaolyS is not repeated every time, but is performed only once.

* I choose thee, so and so by name, as my adhvaryu, as my 
brahmft, as my hot? and as my Sgnldhra. " The adhvaryu takes 
fire from the g&rhapatya, carries it to the ahavanlya mound and 
also to the daksinftgni mound and plaoes a fuel-stiok with its 
end to the east on the ahavanlya with the verse ' mam&gne 
varco ,,,M ( Rg. X. 128. 1, Tai. S. IV. 7. 14. 1 ). The adhvaryu 
and saorifioer perform japa by muttering three verses" 80 ( from 
Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 set out in Sat. I. 2. p. 71 ). While he is between 
the two fires ( ahavanlya and garhapatya ) he mutters standing 
a verse ' antar5gni...manlsaya ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 ). Then he 
offers a samidh into the garhapatya fire with Rg. X. 128. 2 (=Tai. 
S. IV. 7. 14. 1, * mama deva vihave ' ). The adhvaryu and saori- 
fioer mutter two verses ' iha praja &c. ' and ' iha pasavo ' ( Tai. 
Br. III. 7. 4, Sat. I. 2. p. 71 ). The adhvaryu then places a 
samidh on the daksioa fire with ' mayi deva ' ( Rg. X. 128. 3, 
Tai. S. IV. 3. 14. 1). Then the two mutter a verse 'ayam pitrnam" 
(Tai. Br. III. 7. 4). Those who maintained sabhya and avasathya 
fires offered samidhs to them with mantras" 81 ( from Tai. Br. 
III. 7. 4 ). 

If the saorifioer is one who has already performed a soma 
sacrifice then he has to go through the ceremony called ' sakha- 
harana '. Such a saorifioer had to offer sanmyya ( which is 

2279. A mantra is ordinarily to be recited after saying 'om '. But 
this is not the rule in srauta rites and so this has not been stated in the 
text everywhere. The fuol-stick may be offered either by the saorifioer 
or by the adhvaryu ( KSt. II. 1. 2).

On the darseffi he repeats Hnmwf fftj for qWmff (rft: in the above. 

2281. There is a great divergence of view as to the mantras, the 
order of the fires and the number of samidhs. Est. (II. 1. 8-4) prescribes 
the offering of two samidhs in each fire (one with a mantra and the 
other silently). The hymn 9g. X. 128 or Tai. & IV. 3. 14 is called 
' Vihavya '. In the %. it has nine verses, in the Tai. S. it has tea. 
Some held that three verses of this hymn should be repeated for eaoh fire 
( Ap. I. 1. 5). The order of fires was, according to some, first gSrhapatya, 
then daksinlgni, then Bhavanlya (K«t. ll. 1. 6). Some laid that only 
the vytikrtiB were to be uttered when offering fuel-sticks (Ap. 1. 1. 7, 
Eat. IL 1. 6). Another view was that fuel-sticks were to be offered 
silently. 



1012 History of Dharmatostra [Oh. XXX 

prepared by adding to fresh heated milk the sour milk or curds 
of the preoeding night's milking ). 8,M According to the Tai. S. 
II. 5. 4. 1 sannayya was offered only by a somay&jl. Sannayya 
was offered to Indra or Mahendra ( Sat. Br. I. 6. 4. 21 and Est. 
IV. 2. 1 0). The Tai. S. II. 5. 4. 4 says that only one who is gata&ri 
( explained above in note 2259 ) can offer sannayya to Mahendra, 
while Sat. ( I. 4 p. 103 ) says that for a year or two after soma- 
ySga the sfinnayya should be offered to Indra and then to 
Mahendra. In the full moon istf the deities to whom purodasa 
( oake ) is offered are Agni and Agnlsoma and in it ajya is 
offered to PrajSpati silently between the two purodasas. In the 
new moon is^i the deities of purodasa are Agni and Indragni 
and sannayya is offered by a somayajl to Indra or Mahendra 
instead of the purodasa to Indragni ( Asv. I. 3. 9-12 ). 

Now ikkhaharaw ( whioh applies only to him who has 
performed soma-yaga and only in darsestf ) will be described. 
The adhvaryu fetches a fresh branch of the palaaa or saml 
tree, whioh ( branch ) is taken from the eastern, northern or 
north-east side of the tree, whioh has many leaves and whioh 
has not a dried up end. Vide Jai. IV. 2. 7 about the text ' he 
brings a branch turned to the east ' &o. He outs it off with 
the words ' iae tva ' ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 1. 1 ), then touches water, 
makes it straight or wipes it down with ' iirje tva ' ( Tai. S. I. 
1. 1. 1 ), brings it towards the sacrifioial ground with a verse 
* imam priclm * ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 set out in Ap. 1. 2. 1, Sat. I. 2, 
p. 76 ). With that branch he drives away ( or separates ) from 
their mothers six calves with the mantra ' vayavas ethopfiyavas 
sfcha ' ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 1. 1 ). The adhvaryu makes the cows ( of the 
sacrificer) start for the pasture with "the mantra 'devovah 
savita prSrpayatu...ma vah stena Isata magha-samsah ' ( Tai. 
S. I. 1. 1), invokes them, when they have started, with a 
mantra ' suddhS apah suprapftne pibantth' (Bg. VI. 28. 7, 
Tat Br. II. 8. 8 set out in Sat. I. 2. p. 79 ). Then be returns to 

the house of the saorifioer with ' dhruva asmin bahvlh' 

( Tai S. L 1. 1 ) and keeps the branch in a well-known plaoe (bo 
that it might not fall or be lost ) on the sacred fire ground or on 
a wooden frame near the fires with ' protect the oattle of the 
saorifioer ' (Tai. S. I. 1. 1 ). Jai. ( III. 6. 28-29 ) states that 
sSkhanarana 1b meant for both evening and morning milking.

The saorifioei "" crosses by the west of the ahavanlya to its 
south and performs Scamana ( sipping water ). Then he con* 
templates on the sea and pays homage to the deities viz. Agni, 
Vftyu, Aditya'and Vratapati in the manner set out below." 8 * 

BarhirUharam (bringing in the bundles of saored kusa 
grass for use). There are various stages in this operation, 
eaoh stage having its own mantra. The mantras are short 
prose formulae whioh occur in the Tai. S. I. 1. 2. They are 
not set out in detail here. The various stages are: he 
( adhvaryu) takes up a sickle or the rib of a horse or ox kept 
to the north of the g&rhapatya with the famous mantra 

' devasya tvft savitub. prasave adade' (I take thee at the 

impulse of God savitr &o. ). He pays homage to the g&rha- 
patya with a mantra. The sickle (but not the rib) is heated 
on the garhapatya fire. He then goes to the east or north of 
the sacrificial ground ( vih&ra ) for some distance, finds out a 
spot where the desired grass grows, leaves aside one clump of 
darbhas from those growing there and marks as many clumps 
of darbha as he feels would be enough for his purpose, leaves 
one clump or one or two blades with the words, ' I leave you 
aside as the portion of beasts', touches those darbhas that he 
intends to cut with 'this is for the gods', holds them by his 
olosed fingers (of the left hand), rubs them upwards with his 
right hand, brings the siokle in close oontaot with them,

we grow into thousand branches'. He touohes water and 
passes round a handful of darbhas a oord (sulba) from left to 
right, then puts thereon another handful of darbhas and passes 
a oord round it. In this way three or five handfuls are sur- 
rounded by a oord, which has its end stretched on the ground 
towards the east or north. Then heaps of blades are added on 
and over the last heap the prastara is placed. The whole is 
then firmly bound with the cord and a knot is made. He takes 
hold of the bundle thus tied, raises it up, plaoes it on his head, 
returns with it by the way he went, keeps it inside the vedi 
on some grass ( and not on the bare ground ) near the spot 
where the middle paridhi would be. He pronounces over tbe 
barhis thus placed a mantra and keeps the barhis near the 
gSrhapaty a on a mat or the like. He also cuts off silently and 
brings along with barhis other darbhas called paribhojaniya and 
dried up kusa grass also (ulaparaji). MM 

Idhmaharaya (bringing the wood-sticks). Twenty-one 
wood-sticks of palftsa or khadira are required, out of which 15 
are meant for throwing into the fire at the time of repeating 
the s&midhenl verses, three are paridhis, U8T two samidhs are 
to be used at the two agharas and the 21st is the stick for 
anuyajas. A oord is made of darbhas and spread on the ground 
with its end to the north, the idhraa is heaped on it with a 
mantra (Ap. I, 6. 1, Sat. 1. 1, p. 89). The bundle is tied with 
the oord and a knot is made and the idhma is laid alongside 
of the barhis. The pieces of wood that are thrown off when 
cutting the idhma are called idhmapravraicana. A bunch of 
darbhas called veda is made of the size of the knee of a calf by 
doubling and tying the darbhas with a cord and cutting the 

2286. The paribhojaniya darbhas are meant for making seats for 
the priests, the sacrifioei and his wife. Vide Hang's tr. of Ait. Br. 
p. 79 for a note on "barbis, paribhojanlya and veda. £p. I. 6. 4 states 
that while making the veda bnnob the mantra ' tvayS vedim viridnh ' 
(Tai. Br. III. 7. 4) is recited.

thiokest, that to the south is the longest, that to the north is the thinnest 
and shortest. Vide 2p. I. 5. 7-10 and Kit. II. 8. 1 for paridhis. Tbe 
paridhis are about three spans or one bahu long, while samidhs are 
two spans ( prttesa, distanoe between tbe thumb and index finger when 
both are stretched away from each other).

darbhas about one span above the tying cord and a mantra Is 
repeated over it ( 4 vedosi * &o. in Sat. I. 2. p. 80). This veda 
is employed in sweeping the vedi with a mantra. It is given 
to the wife wben she has to repeat a mantra in any action 
( compare Asv. 1. 11. 1 ). The out portions of darbhas of which 
veda is formed are called veda-parivdsana. These two, idhma- 
pravrasoana and veda-parivasana, are placed together. He 
takes up a branoh, outs off its leaves (but not all) inside the 
vedi, so chisels one end of it as to make of it a shovel. This 
is called upavesa" 81 . He recites a mantra over it (upavesosi... 
bhavftsi nah, Ap. 1. 6. 7, Sat. I. 3. p. 91 ). In the Full moon 
sacrifice the upavesa is made silently. He places on the 
upavesa a triple (made of three darbhas) band of darbhas in 
such a way that the roots and end portions of both are in contact 
but they are not tied together into a knot over it. The saorificer 
invokes this triple band called pavitra with a mantra 'trivrt 
pal&se &c. ' ( Tai Br. III. 7. 4, ip. L 6. 10, Sat. I. 3. p. 92 ). 

After this in the afternoon the pinda-pitryajfia is perfor- 
med in the darses^i, but not in the puruamasa istf. Pinda- 
pitryajfia is separately described below. 

If the sacrificer has celebrated the soma sacrifice at some 
time then he has to perform aayam-doha. When the house- 
holder has offered the evening agnihotra, he spreads darbhas to 
the north of the garhapatya, washes the sannayya utensils (that 
are the same as are required for sayam-doha ) in twos and lays 
them on the darbhas with their mouths turned downwards.

( Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 ) and are invoked with a mantra ( pr&n&p&nau 
&o. ). The adhvaryu wipes them with water upwards ( from 
the bottom ) with the mantra ' you two are holy by the mind of 
Visnu '. Jai. III. 8. 32 ( and also Sahara thereon ) says that the 
two pavitras and the vidhrfcis ( described later on ) are not taken 
from the cut barhis, but from the kusa grass called pari- 
bhojanlya. The adhvaryu loudly announces ' purify the cow, 
the ropes and all the utensils \ m0 The adhvaryu places the two 
pavitras inside the agnihotra-havanl, pours water therein, puri- 
fies the water by moving the pavitras eastward and then baok- 
wards and raising them up thrioe with their tips to the north by 
repeating the mantra in the gayatrl metre ' devo vah savitot-

of eaoh pftda ( and twice silently ). He invokes the water with 
' apo devlr-agrepuv«...( Tai. 1. 1. 5. 1, Vaj. S. 1.12-13 ), then turns 
the mouths of the vessels upwards and sprinkles them thrice 
with the water ( leaving no water in the agnihotrahavanl ) and 
with ' may you purify for this divine rite, for the worship of 
gods ' ( Tai. S. I. 1. 3. 1 ). He keeps the two pavitras in a well- 
known plaoe. He waits for the cows coming from the pasture 
with a mantra 'eta acaranti' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4)." M The 
adhvaryu -takes the upavesa with ' thou art dhrsti, impart brahma' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 7. 1 ), takes out with the upavesa burning coals 
from the g&rhapatya to its north. He places the ukha on those 
coals and kindles burning coals round it with ' may you become 
hot with the tapaa of Bhrgus and Angirases ' ( Tai. S. L 1. 7. 2 ).

with its tip to the east ( to the north in the morning milking ) 
in the ukha with a mantra, touches-the ukha and restrains his 
speeoh"' 3 holding the iakhapavitra. The person who is to milk 
the cow takes the abhidhanl ( the rope ) with ' adityai rasnasi ' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 2. 2 ) and the two nidSna ropes silently and makes 
the oalf join the cow with ' thou art Pusan \ The adhvaryu 
issues a direotion that no one is to pass between the oow that is 
being suoked by the calf and the sacrificial ground ( vihara ) 
and all obey it. The adhvaryu invokes the cow with a mantra 
and the milker Bits down near the cow to milk her with a 
mantra. 8594 The householder repeats a mantra when the oow is 
being milked and another when he hears the sound of the 
streams of milk falling into the vessel. The milker brings the 
milk to the adhvaryu, who asks him ' whom did you milk, 
declare to us, ( this is ) an offering to Indra, it is vigour '. The 
milker refers to the oow by her name ( suoh as Gangs ) and adds 
' in whom milk has been placed for gods and men '. The 
adhvaryu replies ' she ( the cow named ) is the life of all '. 
The adhvaryu places the pavitra in the kumbhl ( or ukha ) and 
pours therein the milk across the pavitra with a mantra. The 
adhvaryu gets two more cows milked in the same manner ( i. e. 
with the same mantras &c. ) except the directions ( such as no 
one should come &o. ). The only difference is that the names 
of the cows will be different ( suoh as Yamuna ) and that the 
2nd and 3rd oows are referred to by him respectively as ' visva- 
vyacSh ' and ' visvakarmft ' instead of ' visvSyuh ' ( in his prati- 
vaoana ). After three cows are milked he loudly utters thrioe 
' milk much for Indra, may the offering (havya) increase for the 
gods, for the calves, for men ; be ready for milking again \ If 
there are more cows ( generally six are referred to ) they also 
are got milked with the same mantras as for the first cow or 
silently and the adhvaryu does not hold his tongue, nor does he

touch the kumbhl while the other oows are being milked. Jai. 
(XL 1. 47-53) conoludes that the passage of Tai. Br. about milk- 
ing the other three oows is a mere anuvada and not a vidhi 
and Sahara quotes passages of the sruti that on that night no 
agnihotra is offered with milk and the ohildren in the house 
do not get any milk ( as all milk is used up for the sannayya ), 
When all are milked, if any drops have fallen about ( on the 
ground &o. ) he repeats a mantra ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 3. 1 ) and invokes 
the pot in whioh sannayya is to be prepared with a mantra. He 
washes the inside of the milking vessel with water and then 
pours that water into the pot (in whioh sannayya is to be 
prepared ). He heats the milk and pours over it ( i. e. does 
abfugharaija ) clarified butter silently. He draws the heated pot 
from the burning ooals in suoh a way as to make a line on the 
ground and places it to the east, north or north-east with a 
mantra. When the bottom of the heated vessel cools, he adds 
ourds to it in order to coagulate the fresh milk with ' I add 
soma ( i. e. curds) to thee in order to turn thee into curds for 
Indra ' (TaL S. 1. 1. 3 )."" He adds to the vessel what remains 
stioking to the pot or sruo after agnihotra was offered with 
a mantra or silently. He pours water in the vessel that is 
meant as a lid or cover and places that cover or lid on the pot 
of heated milk. If the covering be of earthenware he throws 
thereon grass or a twig. He takes out the sakhapavitra with 
a mantra (if apalasa branoh was used ) or silently ( if one of 
saml was used) and keeps it in a secure place. He keeps the 
sannayya in the gfirhapatya side of the vihara on a iikya or 
some such contrivance with '0 Visnu, guard the offering*. 

He brings another branch with whioh or with darbhas he 
separates the calves for the morning milking (on theprinoipal 
day ). The same procedure as for sayafhdoha is followed in the 

2295. There were several views here about adding cards. One, 
two or three oows are milked on the day previous to the upavasatha day 
(i.e. on the 14th) and that milk is used to aoidify the fresh heated milk 
of the evening of the upavasatha day. Another method was to milk the 
oow or oows on the 12th, then to add the ourds of that to the milk of 
the 13th day and add all the ourds of those two days to the milk of the 
14th day i. e. milking and adding of curds was to go on continuously 
from the 12th, 13th and 14th or from 13th or from 14th. Vide Ap. 1. 13. 12 
and Sat. I. 3, p. 99. If no ourds be available he adds either rioe or 
pieces of falsa* bark or wild or village badara fruit or ptltTka plant 
(the pratinidhi of soma) to the milk to make it sour. Vide Ap. 1. 14. 1, 
Bat. I. 9. p. 100.

morning milking (of the principal day). There are a few 
differences as to mantras, as to not adding ooagulating sub- 
stance, whioh are passed over. 

After the sayafnddha (evening milking) the adhvaryu 
directs ( fignldhra or some other priest or himself ) ' strew kusa 
grass round the fires, first round ahavanlya, then garhapatya, 
then daksinagni ' or the order may be first garhapatya, then 
daksinagni and lastly ahavanlya. The darbhas strewn on the 
south and north have tips turned to the east. The saorificer 
mutters a mantra when kusas are being strewn. 

Having done so much he observes the amavasya as an 
upavasatha. Thus on the amavasya day he performs agnyan- 
vadhana ( offering fuel-stioks into fires ), separating the calves 
with the branch, sayamdoha, bringing barhis and idhma, pre- 
paring the veda and vedi and observing some vows. But two 
of these viz. separating calves from their mothers and sayam- 
doha are performed only by him who has already performed a 
soma sacrifice. In the case of the purnamasa is^i if spread 
over two days, on the Full moon day only agnyanvadhana and 
strewing kusas round the fires are gone through and on the 
next day are performed the bringing of barhis and idhma and 
making of veda and all the other rites. If the istf is to be 
performed in one day only, then kusa grass is strewn round 
the fires after the making of the veda bunch. 

About eannayya Sat. states some divergent views. The 
Kapeyas held that even one who has not performed soma-yaga 
may offer sannayya and the deity in his case will be Indra 
and after he offers Soma, the deity for sSnnayya will be 
Mahendra. According to Sahara on Jai. X, 8. 44 the GopS- 
yanas held that one who has not performed a soma sacrifice may 
offer sannayya. According to Sat. himself, for a year or two after 
Somayaga the deity will be Indra and then Mahendra if the 
sacrificer so desires. Persons of the Aurva and Gautama gotras 
and those who are gatairl ( vide note 2259 ) may if they like 
offer sannayya to Mahendra even before performing Somay&ga. 
Compare Ap. I. 14. 8-11 and vide Jai. X. 8. 35-4,6 ( about the 
two purodasas and sannayya). 

On the principal day (i. e. the first day of the dark half 
in the case of purnamasa) the saorificer offers his daily agnihotra 
before Bunrise and begins after sunrise the performance of the 
purnamasa isj) (and in the case of the darses^l before sunrise).

He washes his hands with water with the mantra " May I 
he able to carry out this rite meant for you two and for gods " 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 4. 1 ). From the place of the garhapatya fire to 
the ahavanlya he spreads a line of dry ku&a grass continuously 
with their tips to the east (without leaving any space unoovered) 
with the mantra 'thou art the continuity of the sacrifice, I 
spread thee for the continuity of sacrifice, thee for the conti- 
nuity of the saorifice ' (Tai. Br. III. 2.4) and then spreads another 
line of kusas to the south and another to the north of this 
first line silently. To the south of the ahavanlya, seats of 
kusa grass are made ready for the brahma priest and the saori- 
fioer, that of the brahma being to the east of the seat of 
the sacrificer and directly to the south of the ahavanlya and 
of the sacrificer to the south of the south corner of the east 
side of the vedi. To the north of gSrhapatya kusas are strewn 
with their tips to the east or north and on them the sacrificial 
implements ( yajiapatras ) are placed in twos after being 
washed with water and with their mouths turned down, viz., 
the sphya and kapalas &c. (vide above note 2233 for the ten ). 
This is called patrasadana (placing the utensils near). "" 

Then follows brahmavarava. 

The saorifioer sitting on a seat with his faoe to the north 
then chooses his brahma priest who faces the east near the 
utkara with the formula MW '01 Lord of the earth I Lord of 
the worlds ! Lord of great being ( Heaven ? ) ! I choose thee as 
brahma' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The brahma priest when so 
chosen mutters a long formula ( which is given in Ap. III. 18. 4 
from the Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 and part of which is translated 
here ) ' I am the Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds, 
lord of the great being. Being impelled by god Savifcr 
I shall perform the duties of a priest. God Savitrl Here

loudly says ' O Brhaspati, protect the sacrifice '(ibid.) and cross- 
ing the altar by the west of the ahavanlya towards the south of 
the ahavanlya, stands to the south of his seat with his face to the 
north, takes a kusa blade from the blades on the seat prepared for

with the words * avaunt," 98 Daidhiaavya ( son of a re-married 
widow ? ), get up from this place, occupy the seat of another, 
who is more ignorant than me ' ( Tai. S. III. 2. 4. 4. ), touches 
water and sits down on his seat with face to the east with a 
mantra and then faces the ahavanlya with a mantra ' Here do 

I, impelled by God Savitr, sit on the seat of Vasu (or prosperity) 
lower in level ( than the ahavanlya mound ), I oocupy the seat 
of Brhaspati, this I deolare to Agni, to Vayu, to the Sun, to the 
Earth ' ( vide Ap. 111.18. 4, Eat. II. 1. 24 ). The brahma is required 
to be the most learned in Vedio lore' ( brahmistha, as Ap. III. 
18. 1 says ) and he is to observe silence while mantras are being 
repeated and superintends all actions. His permission is asked 
by the adhvaryu at the time of doing most of the aots, suoh as 
leading forward the pranlta water, sprinkling the bundle of 
fuel-stioks and kusa grass. There are four priests in darsa- 
purnamfisa ( vide note 2228 ). The saorificer also crosses by the 
west side of the ahavanlya to its south, throws away silently a 
blade of kusa from his seat and then sits down on the seat 
prepared for him, with his face to the east. The adhvaryu takes 
two darbhas of equal thiokness, the tops of which are not out off 
and makes them a span in length by outting off their roots 
( without using his nails ). am 

The adhvaryu, sitting to the west ( or north ) of the garha- 
patya fire, takes a camasa (a rather flat vessel or pan) In which 
water is to be carried forward with ' to thee for Daksa ' ( Ap. L 
17. 1 ) and washes it thrice with water once with mantra and

you be washed for gods, may you shine for the gods, may you 
be pure for gods' ( Ap. 1. 16. 3 ). He keeps the two pavitras in 
the oamasa and pours water in the camasa with ' who takes 
you, let him take you, for whom shall I take you, I take you 
for him, you for prosperity ' ( Ap. I. 16. 3 ) and at the same 
time contemplates on the Earth with 'I take you with this ' 
(not uttered). He fills the vessel so as to leave some space at the 
top and purifies the water by the process called utpavana (describ- 
ed above in note 2291 ). He then invokes them with ' may the 
divine waters, that are the first purifiers and the leaders carry 
this sacrifice to the front, may they place the lord of the 
sacrifice in front, Indra ohose you in his fight with Vrtra, you 
chose him in the fight with Vrtra, you are sprinkled ' ( Tai. S. I. 
1. 5. 1 ). The adhvaryu then asks the permission of the brahmS 
priest in the words 'Brahman! shall I carry forward the water* 
and issues a direction ' saorificer, observe silence '. The brahma 
priest mutters a mantra ' Lead forward the sacrifice, sustain 
these deities, may the saorificer be on the baok of heaven. Place 
this saorifice and the sacrifioer in the world where the seven sages 
and other men of holy deeds dwell* and loudly says 'yes, do carry 
the water forward '. The adhvaryu then repeats the verse ' who 
oarries you forward ? Let him oarry you forward, I carry for-

conveying to the sacrifioer thousandfold prosperity, the waters 
that delight in drink, having a shining (or oily) appearance'. 
He holds the water in a vessel which is covered by the sphya 
that has its tip to the east and that is held level with his nose 
and oarries it forward without allowing even a drop to fall 
down. When the water is being carried the saorificer invokes 
it with a mantra.'* 00 The adhvaryu places the water vessel 
( pranltSpatra ) on darbha grass to the north of the ahavanly a 
with the mantra ' you are sanctified by brahma ( prayers ) ; who 
employs you ? Let him employ for ( securing ) all desires, for 
the worship of gods ( Ap. IV. 4. 4 ) ' and then covers the vessel 
with kusas. All these acts constitute praxtitapramyana. While 
the water is being placed near the fihavanlya the sacrifioer 
invokes it with the immediately preoeding mantra and passes 
his eye over the whole of the sacrificial ground. No one is to 
pass between the fihavanlya and the pranltft water (E&t. II. 3. 4).

The principal purpose of the pranlta waters is that they are 
used for making the ground grains into a dough for purodasa 
and their final disposal is to be poured into the vedi ( Jai. IV. 2. 
11-15 ). The adhvaryu comes back by the same way that he 
went, plaoes down the sphya among the yajnap&tras and touohes 
the sacrificial utensils with his hand wearing a pavitra with the 
mantra ' may the divine groups enter into the sacrificial 
utensils '. 

Then follows nirv3pa tm ( taking out handfuls of grains or 
a portion of other sacrificial material ). The adhvaryu takes in 
his hand the ladle called agnihotra-havanl with ' thou art made 
of a tree for daksa ' ( strength ). Then he holds it in his 
left hand and takes the winnowing basket ( surpa ) in his 
right hand with 'to thee for the all-pervading (yajfia)'. 
Then he heats it ( ladle ) on the garhapatya fire with 
' the raksaa ( evil spirit ) is burnt, the enemies are burnt '. 
He then touohes water." 08 The adhvaryu asks the permis- 
sion of the saorificer in the words ' sacrificer ! shall I 
take out saorifioial material' and the saorificer replies 'yes, 
do take out'. The adhvaryu then utters the words 'I go 
towards the wide space' and approaches a cart or wooden 
frame (sakata ) standing to the west of the ahavanlya or garha- 
patya containing either rice or barley grains ( in the husk ), 
which has the shafts turned to the east or north, which has the 
yoke joined to it and is covered with mats. While touching 
the right side of the yoke be mutters ' thou art dhur ( destruc- 
tive fire), injure the destructive (enemy), destroy him who 
seeks to destroy us and whom we seek to destroy '. He touohes 
the left shaft and mutters the mantra ' thou art of the gods 
( i. e. belongest to them ), thou art the purest ( or the most 
generous), the fullest, the dearest, the best carrier, the best 
summoner of the gods'. He plaoes (firmly touohes with) his 
right foot on the left wheel (of the sakata) with 'Visnu tra- 
versed thee '. He mounts the cart with his left foot with ' thou 
art an unbent receptacle of havis, mayst thou be strong and not

break (or bend)'. He makes an opening by removing the mats 
covering the sakata and looks'at the corn to be used for making 
the purodasa and at the mats while repeating twioe the 
mantra ' I look at thee with the eye of Mitra, do not be 
afraid, do not tremble, I shall not injure thee'. He touohes 
the corn (to be used for purodasa) with 'may you sustain 
strength', then touches his own heart with 'put milk in me' 
and touches water. Then he throws aside a blade of grass or 
clod of earth with ' warded off is the evil spirit', touohes water 
and repeats the Dasahotr mantras. s803 He places the two pavi- 
tras in the winnowing basket (silently), takes one handful 
of the grain (from the oart) with 'may the five fingers 
give yon for protection, and not to the enemy' ( Maitra- 
yanlya S. LI. 5), puts (empties) the handful in the sruo 
( agnihotrahavanl ) and puts in the winnowing basket ( on 
which the two pavtiras have been kept ) four handf uls of grain 
by means of the agnihotra-havan!, three with the mantra 
( repeated thrice ) ' at the command of god Savitr, with the arms 
of Asvins, with the hand of Pusan I take out thee that art 
dear to Agni ' "°* and the fourth silently. Jai. ( IX. 1. 36-37 ) 
concludes that this mantra is the same even in all modifications 
of the darsapurnamSsa and Sahara explains ' savituh prasave ' 
as meaning ' urged by the yajamfina ' ( or when the sun rises ), 
' asvins ' as meaning the saorificer and his wife ( as they make 
a gift of the horse in agnyadheya ) and pusan as meaning 
' yajamfina ' himself ( who supports all ). In Jai. XL 4. 44-45 
it is stated that the mantra for nirvfipa ' devasya tva ', the 
mantra for cutting off barhis ( barhirdevasadanam dami ) are 
to be repeated and not to be uttered only once. In Jai. V. 2. 4-5 
it is established that all the samskSraa are to be performed on 
all the grains after four handfuls are taken and not on eaoh 
handful as it is taken out. The saorificer invokes with a 
mantra while the adhvaryu is making the mrvapa ' I call here 
Agni, the hotr and the gods that are well disposed to sacrifice ; 
may the gods, pleased in mind, come and may they partake 
of this my offering.' Having finished the taking out of grains in

four handfuls, ( the adhvaryu ) throws on them some more grains 
with his hand. If no oart is available, he keeps an earthen 
vessel on the sphya placed on the altar with its tip to the north 
or east and takes out the grains from that vessel ( this is the 
modern praotioe ) and then removes the wooden sword from 
underneath it. The same procedure is followed in the case of 
purodasas for other deities. The adhvaryu touohes the grains 
taken out with 'this of the gods' and touches the rest (remaining 
in the saka^a or vessel ) with ' this is ours together ( with the 
gods ).' He invokes the grains taken out with ' I take ( or 
invoke ) thee for increase and not for malevolence.' He moves 
out of the mats covering the cart (or from near the vessel) taking 
with him the surpa with ' thee I release from the fetters of 
Varuna ' ( compare Maitrayanl S. I. 1. 5 ). He looks at the 
sacrifioial ground, the fires, the utensils, the priests with ' may 
I see heaven ' and at the ahavanlya with ' the light of Vaisva- 
nara ( Agni ).' He gets down from the cart with ' may the posts 
( or mansions ) of Heaven and Earth, stand firm ' ( if corn is 
taken from a vessel he only mutters these words ). He invokes 
the grains that have fallen down ( when four handfuls were 
taken out ) with ' to Heaven and Earth, svfiha ' and goes near 
the garhapaty a with ' follow wide space ( or sky ).* He puts down 
the surpa ( containing the corn taken out ) near the g&rhapatya 
to its west ( or near that fire on which in that particular rite 
he has to hake the cake ) with ' I make you sit on the lap of 
Aditi ' M0S and consigns it to the protection of that deity ( for 
whioh the cake is meant ) with ' fire I proteot the sacrifioial 
material." 80 ' The adhvaryu pours water in the (agnihotrahavanl) 
ladle to which the awns of the rice or barley grains stiok and 
purifies it thrice with the two pavitras ( blades of kusa ) held in 
the hands and with the mantra ' may god Savifcr &o.' ( vide 
p. 1024 above ) and invokes it with 'may the divine waters * &o. 
Then the adhvaryu seeks the permission of the brahma priest 
with ' Brahman I shall I sprinkle ' ( with holy water the 
sacrificial material ). The brahma priest mutters ' sprinkle the 
sacrifice, sustain these deities &c.' and loudly says ' Yes, do 
sprinkle.' The adhvaryu then sprinkles water thrice, once 
with the mantra 'at the command of Savitr I sprinkle

the case may be) and twice silently. One should so sprinkle 
that drops of water may not fall on the fire. He then upturns 
the sacrifioial utensils ( i. e. instead of their mouths being 
down, their mouths are now upturned) and sprinkles them 
thrice with water with ' may you become pure for divine rite, 
for worship of gods *. ,m The rest of the water taken for 
sprinkling is placed to the east of the gfirhapatya ( in a sruc ). 
It is stated by Jaimini ( IX. 1. 2-3 ) that the proksana of the 
mortar and pestle or the mill-stones has an unseen spiritual 
result (apurva). 

The adhvaryu sits to the west of the gfirhapatya, takes 
hold of the black antelope skin lying on the altar with ' thou 
art the whirl of the wind ' and shakes it thrice on the utkara 
holding it in such a way that the neok portion is up and the 
hairy portion inside (towards himself) with ' destroyed is the 
evil spirit, destroyed are the enemies'. To the west of the 
utkara he spreads the antelope sm skin with its neck portion 
westwards ( Sat. Br. 1. 1. 4. 5 ) and its hairy portion upwards 
with " thou art the skin of Aditi \ The portion Mo » of the skin 
near the anus ( of the animal ) is twisted below the hairless part 
and both parts are held together with 'may the earth know 
thee '. While still touohing the skin he places the mortar on 
it with 'thou art the adhisavana (the utensil for pressing or 
beating the grains) made of a tree, may the skin of Aditi know

antelope wanders naturally. Vide Sat. Br. 1. 1. 4. 1-2, where yajfia is 
said to have escaped from the gods and wandered about as a black 
antelope and the white, black and yellow hairs of the antelope are said 
to represent respectively IJg, Soman and Yajus. On account of its 
holiness, the antelope skin is employed for husking and bruising the 
grains ( from which the cake is to be made ).

pours into its mouth the saorifioial materials (unhusked grains 
of rioe or barley ) thrioe with 'thou art the body of Fire, M1 ° 
thou art a prompter of speech, I take thee for the enjoyment of 
the gods' and a fourth time silently. He takes the pestle with 
' thou art a stone (hard like a stone), though produced from a 
tree ; mayst thou so strike this sacrificial material for the gods 
that it will be enjoyable to them I ' and beats the grains in the 
mortar thrice with ' may I strike the evil spirit, the enemy of 
heaven, away 1 ' ( the mantra is recited only once according to 
Jai. XI- 4. 42 ). After striking thrioe the adhvaryu utters a 
summons to haviskrt, with ' come, O Haviskrt ' ( repeated 
thrice)**". When the grains begin to be husked the adhvaryu 
utters a call to Agnldhra * strike loudly '. The agnldhra 
takes kutaru ( aaman, a stone ) with ' thou art a stone, thou 
art one that makest a hymn of praise (or glory)' and he 
strikes therewith the large mill-stone ( drsad) that is placed on 
the altar ( twioe, once with mantra and once silently ) and the 
smaller one ( upala ) once with ' proclaim food ( to the gods ), 
proclaim strength ; may you ( all saorifioial utensils ) proolaim 
that ( the food ) is full of excellent flavour ; may we conquer 
the hordes ( of enemies ) by this noise '. The agnldhra may

grains ( from which a cake is to be prepared ) are said to be the body of

said to be prompters of speeoh.

The figure 3 is used to show that the preceding letter is pluta (of

other separator of grains (III. 2. 6-9). Jai. (XII. 2. 11) establishes 
that there is no haviskrt oali in savanlya purodgs'as. Aocording to Sat. 
Br. 1. 1. 4. 13 the wife formerly rose to the haviskrt oall but in Its time 
either the wife or the Kgnldhia priest rose.

strike silently with the yoke-pin ( samya ) instead of using a 
stone ( £p. I. 20. 4 ). He repeats this thrice ( i. e. striking with 
a stone or yoke-pin is done nine times in all ). After this the 
sacrificed wife or some one else (suoh as the agnldhra) 
threshes the grains in the mortar ( Kat. II. 4. 14 ). Jai. ( XI. 1. 
27 ) states that the beating has a seen purpose ( viz. removal of 
husk) and so it is to be continued as long as required for effect- 
ing that purpose. Jai. ( IV. 2. 26 ) further lays down that the 
Vedio sentence ' vrlbln-avahawi ' is a restrictive injunction 
( niyamavidhi ) in that, when unhusking can be effected either 
by using the mortar and pestle or by some other method ( such 
by using the nails ) it restricts one to the former method. The 
adhvaryu then holds the winnowing basket near the mouth of 
the mortar to its east or north with the words ' thou art grown 
by rain ' W1 ( as it is made of bamboo ) and touches the beaten 
grains (to be used, for purodftaa ) with 'you are grown by 
rain '. He then puts with his hand tbe beaten grains into the 
winnowing basket with 'may (the surpa) know thee* (the 
grains as its own ). Holding the surpa over the utkara he thrice 
winnows the grains and frees them from the husk ( which falls 
ontheutfeara) with 'thrown away is the evil spirit, thrown 
away are the enemies' ( i. e. the huBks are meant to be the portion 
of evil spirits ). He makes the husks stioking to the surpa fall 
on the utkara with ' blown away are the enemies \ He puts the 
husks from the place of the utkara over the ( middle ) potsherd 
( on whioh the cake is to be baked ) and places them (the husks) 
underneath the black antelope skin in its north-west corner 
with ' thou art the portion of evil spirits '. He does not look at 
these husks. He presses down with his hand the spot where 
the husks are kept with ' pressed down is the evil spirit'. He 
touohes water, sprinkles the potsherd ( on which the husks were) 
with water and keeps the potsherd in its place. He separates 
tbe husked and unhuaked grains with * may the wind separate 
you.' He then pours out the grains of rioe from the surpa in the 
pot with the words ' may the god Savitr with his golden hands 
( rays ) aocept you '. He then takes them and pours them in 
the mortar and issues a direction (praisa) to the aaerificer's

prosperity. Vide Tai. Br. III. 2. 5 « *tfor f *r sforvnr: i <ri*jT (far.

The wife or some one else or a dasi ( a maid-servant ) does the 
threshing several times, then she hands over the pestle to the 
agnldhra who beats with the pestle the grains and then the 
wife does the final beating with ' may you become pure for the 
gods, shine for the gods, purify for the gods'. Tiie adhvaryu 
puts the kanas ( little particles of rice grains ) separated from 
the polished grains of rioe in a vessel, cleanses the polished 
grains that are in the surpa with water. That portion which 
remains after the grains are beaten thrice is made to flow 
towards the utkara with the water ( collected in another vessel ) 
that is used in washing the polished grains with ' this is 
the portion of evil spirits. May the waters carry it forward 
from this place, svfiha ', the water being also poured inside 
the vedi. Then he repeats the whole procedure about the 
blaok antelope skin from its being taken up to its being 
spread already described. Then the adhvaryu places the 
yoke-pin ( samya ) with its head ( kumba, thiok part ) to the 
north on the antelope skin with 'thou art the support of the 
heavenly world'; he establishes Mw the larger mill-stone 
( drsad ) with its faoe to the east on the samya in such a way 
as to cover the samya with its western half with 'thou art 
intelligence (though) made of a stone; may the support of 
heaven know thee ' ; then he places the smaller mill-stone on 
the larger one with ' thou art intelligence ( though ) a ohild of 
the mountain; may the drsad know thee'. The adhvaryu then 
bends and looks at the polished grains that are in the surpa 
with 'you are honeyed rays*. He spreads the polished grains 
on the larger mill-stone thrice with ' at the command of god 

Savitr hands of Pusan ' ( vide p. 1034 for the omitted words). 

I spread you, you are corn, satiate the gods ' and once silently •

and holds it firmly in the middle of the lower mill-stone with 
'to thee for vySna'. Ultimately he grinds towards the east 
with 'I hold this (smaller mill-stone) for the life (of the sacri- 
ficer) in a long and continuous series im of actions (here grind- 
ing)'. Thereafter he continuously grinds the grains at his 
pleasure. He throws the ground grains from the larger mill-stone 
with the smaller mill-stone on to the antelope skin with 'May 
God Savitr with his golden hands (rays) accept you' and bends 
down to look at the ground grains with ' I look at you with 
an unimpaired eye.' He then issues a direotion to the wife 
' grind ( or pound ) without scattering ( the grains away from 
the larger mill-stone or from the antelope skin ) and make them 
into fine flour.' Either the wife grinds or a maid-servant (dasl) 
may do so ( Ap. I. 21. 8-9 ) ; and then keeps aside the well- 
ground flour in a well-known place. The adnvaryu heats on the 
garhapatya water called madanti sm brought from the pranlta 
water. The offerings (of oooked vegetable food) are cooked 
either on the garhapatya or on the ahavanlya fire. 

The adhvaryu, after sitting to the west of the garhapatya, 
takes the upavesa with ' thou art dhrstf ( bold one ), give 
brahma (holy food ?).' He separates two burning coals from 
the western portion of the garhapatya fire with the upavesa and 
keeps them on the eastern side of the garhapatya mound itself. 
He oasts outside one of the two coals to the north-west of the 
garhapatya with ' O Fire i Dash aside the fire that eats ( cooks ) 
raw food ( not cooked in accordance with sastra ) ; and forbid 
that fire that eats flesh ( cooks ordinary meat food ).' He then 
touches water, places the remaining coal on that spot on the 
west ( of the garhapatya mound where he has to place the 
potsherds) with 'bring that fire that worships the gods.' He then 
places the middle one ,SI8 ( of the eight potsherds ) thereon with 
' thou art firm, make the earth firm, strengthen life, progeny 
and surround the sacrifioer with his kinsmen.' He lays a

2317. According to ip. I. 28. 24 the kaptias are first arranged 
( kapSlopadhSna ) and then the madanti water is heated, while 
Say tBssdha ( I. 6-6 ) reverses these processes.

burning coal on that potsherd with * burnt is the evil spirit, 
burnt are the enemies.' The potsherds, whether eight, eleven 
or more or less, are arranged on the garhapatya mound. To the 
east of the central one he places a kapala with ' thou art the 
supporter, make the aerial spaoe firm, strengthen prfina and 
apana, surround the saorificer with bis kinsmen.' Then a third 
is placed to the east of the 2nd with ' thou art dharuna ( suppor- 
ter ), support heaven, the eye, the ear and surround &o.' He 
places the 4th kapala to the south-east with ' thou art dharma 
( supporter ), support the directions, the home, progeny, surround 
&o.' ; he places the fifth to the south-west with * thou art the 
strength ( or host ) of maruts ' ; he places the 6th in the north- 
west with ' thou art a restrainer, support the directions, wealth, 
prosperity, surround &o.' ; he places the 7th to the north-east 
with ' I place thee that art uninjured from all the directions for

In modem times- many agnihotrins do not generally employ 
eight or eleven potsherds but employ one earthen brick ( that 
would have the shape of the kapSlas when placed together ), on 
which lines are scratched to indioate the number of kapalas. 
Then taking coals from the garhapatya he spreads the coals on 
the potsherds ( whether 8, 11 or more or less ) with the veda 
bunch repeating for each potsherd ' may you be heated by the

The adhvaryu heats the pStrl ( the purod&sa patrl, according 
to Eat. II. 6. 49 ) that is washed with water on the fire on which 
the cake is to be baked and when it is heated and slightly 
cooled he places the pavitras on it and pours on to it across the 
pavitras the flour (of ground and bruised grains) from the 
black antelope skin with the yajus mantra ,ii0 ' devasya tva ... 
agnaye jus^am samvapami ' thrioe and once silently. While 
pouring the ground grains he restrains his speech and gives 
up the restraint only when he spreads holy ashes over the 
purodasa ( vide below ). He purifies the flour by moving for- 
wards and backwards and raising up the two pavitras ( darbha 
blades ) the tips of which are turned northwards thrioe ( i. e. he 
performs utpavana ) once with the mantra ' haryos-tva varfi- 
bhySm-ut-punfimi ' or with the mantra ' devo vab. ' ( vide note 
2291 above). He takes in the sruva ladle water from the 
pranlta water, and supporting it on the veda bunch pours that 
water on the flour with a mantra ' waters have joined with 
waters &c.' ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 8. 1 ) and also pours thereon the hot 
water from the madanti vessel with the mantra 3W ' you are 
generated from waters ' and mixes the flour through and 
through on all sides with the water from left to right with 
' may you be well mixed up with water * ( Tai. S. I. 1. 8. 1 ). 
He stirs and mixes the flour and water with the meksaw lm 
with ' I mix thee together for generation ', and makes a ball ( of 
the flour ) with ' thou art the head of the sacrifice '. He then

Haug's translation of Ait. Br. p. 3 n. 3 as to how the cake is baked.

divides the hall into two parts with ' may you ( two ) become 
separate according to the respective shares ( of the deities ) '. He 
makes two balls of equal size from the dough and touches the 
two separately - with ' this for Agni ' and ' this for Agni and 
Soma.'' 3 ' 8 From the group of potsherds to the south he removes 
the burning coals with the veda bunch with ' Here do I remove 
the face from the approaching ( or attacking ) army ' and then 
removes the coals also from the group of potsherds that are to 
the north. Taking the ball of flour that is to be placed on the 
southern potsherds with ' thou art the head of the sacrifice ' he 
bakes the ball with ' thou art heat and bestower of all life ' and 
similarly bakes the other ball on the northern group of 
potsherds in the same way.**" He makes the cake assume the 
shape of a tortoise, but its back should be neither too high nor 
too low like an apupa and the cake should be as large as the 
hoof of a horse.' 8 " He spreads the cake so that it covers all 
the potsherds with ' may thou spread wide " ( i. e. have progeny 
&c. ). He puts water in the vessel ( with the water from which 
the flour was mixed up ) and sweeps the surface of the cake 
from left to right with his wet hand in such a way that the 
cake will have a skin-like continuous surfaoe with ' mayst thou 
take on a skin '. He passes a burning firebrand thrice round 
each cake with ' vanished is the evil spirit, vanished are the 
enemies '. He applies over the cakes the flames of burning 
darbhas with ' may the god Savitr bake thee in the kindled 
(fire) called naka '. He applies heat by passing round the cakes 
burning fire-brands with ' may fire not burn thy body 1 Fire, 
protect the offering '. He spreads over the cake ashes in which 
there are also burning coals with 'mayst thou be connected with 
prayer '. The adhvaryu issues a direction ( to the agnldhra ) 
' bake the cakes without burning them ' and here he gives up the 
restraint of speeoh ( that was imposed as stated above ). 

He heats with a burning firebrand the water used for 
wiping the fingers and for scouring the vessels and draws with 
the sphya to the west of the ahavanlya (or garhapatya) three lines

on each of the three lines thrioe in such a way that the water

the next line and that in pouring water he proceeds from east to

To the west of the aha vanly a he constructs a vedi, which 
is in length as muoh as the height of the sacrificer or which is 
as long as required for one's purpose and which has curved 
sides. 3m The sacrificer repeats a verse ' I make a mansion for 
him &o. ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ) and touches the spot where the 
vedi is to be made. The adhvaryu sweeps the Bpot of the vedi 
with the veda bunch once with the mantra ' they knew the vedi 
by means of the veda bunch &o. ' ( Tai. Br. III. 3. 9 ) and twice 
silently before the dust and weeds are removed. 83 ' 8 The yaja- 
mana invokes the vedi when it is being swept by repeating 
certain verses viz. ' you, a young lady, with four tufts of hair 
&o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The adhvaryu takes the sphya 

2326. The story of Ekata, Dvita and Trita who are called Rpya 
ocours in Tai. Br. III. 2. 8. In tho $g. we frequently come across 
Trita, a devotee of Indra, who is there sometimes called Aptya. Vide 
?g. I. 105. 9, VIII. 12. 16, VIII. 47. 13. Trita is said to be the seer 
of $g. IX. 102 and X. 1-7. 

2327. According to the oom. on Sat. I. 6, p. 145 the vedi should be 
4 aratnis or 96 angulas in length. According to Est. II. 6. 2-10 the 
vedi should be 4 aratnis on the west side and 3 on tho oast, three finger 
breadths deep, should slope towards the east or north, should be con- 
tracted in the middle, the corners of its eastern side (called amsas 
shoulders) should envelope the Bhavanlya mound and all the herbs 
growing thereon and the roots should be uprooted. The vedi is deemed 
to have the shape of a young woman with broad hips (the two oorners 
of the west side are called ironi ) and a slender waist and verses are 
repeated which describe it in terms of a well-decked young lady.

the sphya with a darbha with ' thou art wind with a thousand

darbha with its tip to the north or east on the eastern portion of 
the vedi at a spot which is 32 angulas from the eastern side of 
the vedi ( i. e. £ of the length of the vedi ) with ' thou art armour 
for the earth.' 1 *" He strikes the darbha with the sphya saying 
' O Earth, meant as the plaoe for worshipping gods, may I not 
injure the root of thy herb '. He moves aside with the sphya 
the dust together with the cut blade of darbha with ' struck 
aside is the demon Araru from the earth '. He removes the 
dust and the blade witb the sphya outside the vedi towards the 
utkara ,8J0 with 'go to the cowpen, the place of the cows.' 
While this is being done the sacrificer recites by way of invo- 
cation ' O gods 1 I cut off with the bolt of Indra the head of 
him who hates me &c. ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ). The adhvaryu 
looks at the vedi with ' may Heaven rain on thee ' and at the 
sacrificer with ' may rain shower on thee '. The Sgnldhra 
sits down witb the palms of his hands turned upwards to 
the north of the vedi and outside it on a spot at the 
distance of two padaa ( footsteps ) from the north side of the 
vedi with ' salutation to heaven and to the earth. ' The 
adhvaryu spreads near the Sgnldhra the dust together with 
the out blade of grass at the distance of one prakrama 
to the north of the vedi from a spot which is 32 angulas ( or 
i of the vedi) from the eastern side of the vedi WI witb 
' God Savitr ! bind witb a hundred fetters in the most distant

p. 152 ) following Vedio texts, the vedi is prepared on tbe PaurnamSsT

hands*" 8 joined together the plaoe of the utkara with 'the 
restless one is held down' and remains bo. The adhvaryu 
strikes the vedi with the sphya a second time and a third time 
and the same procedure is followed by him and by the ftgnl- 
dhra as at the first striking except that one mantra is different 
foreaoh priest at each of the two strikings. The adhvaryu 
strikes with the sphya a fourth time but silently and all 
actions of the first striking are repeated but without mantras. 
The adhvaryu removes all the remnants of the darbhas from 
the vedi, the yajamana recites the invocatory verse ' I cut off 
the head ' &o. and the fignldbra covers a fourth time with his 
hands with ' may Araru not spring upwards to thy heaven '. 
The adhvaryu then draws with the sphya on the vedi a line 
from the south oorner of the west side of the vedi towards the 
east up to the southern shoulder ( on the east side of the vedi ) 
with" 1 ' ' may the Vasus enfold you with the Gayatrl metre *. 
He draws a line on the western side of the vedi towards the 
north with 'may the Rudras enfold thee with the Tristyibh 
metre ' and draws a line from the northern corner of the west 
side towards the east with ' may the Adityas enfold thee with 
the JagatI metre*. While this is being done the yajamana 
mutters a verse '0 Brhaspati, envelope the vedi &c.\ He 
makes the shoulders of the vedi raised up and envelope the 
ahavanlya mound and the two corners on the western side 
turned towards the garhapatya and the vedi is contracted in 
the middle. The adhvaryu issues a direction MM (to himself

this vedi and make it occupied by the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas 
&c* (Kanaka Sam. I. 9). The agnldhra digs up with the 
sphya the upper layer of dust with ' Araru has been struok off 
from the earth, bring here him who worships the gods' and 
oarries the dust so dug towards the utkara. When this is 
being done the Bacrificer recites two texts. The agnldhra digs 
the ground from west to east for making the vedi with 'at the 
prompting of God Savitr, the worshippers do their work'. 
Whatever roots remain in the ground he removes with the 
sphya, and all dust that remains he removes to the utkara. 
The adhvaryu addresses the brahma priest ' O brahman I shall 
I undertake the further enfolding of the vedi '. The brahma 
priest mutters a mantra 'O Brhaspati, enfold the vedi &o.' 
and loudly replies, 'Yes (om), do enfold*. He enfolds the 
vedi from the south, west, and north respectively ,m with 
'thou art rta (right), thou art the abode of rta, thou art the 
glory of rta*. The yajamsna mutters while this is being done 
a verse * O Brhaspati I enfold the vedi' ( same as the one recited 
by the brahmS above ). The adhvaryu says ' thou art dhs 
( support of the havia ), thou art svadha ( the source of pindas 
offered to Manes ), thou art the wide earth, thou art rich ' and 
makes the surface of the vedi level by means of the sphya from 
east to west. The yajamana invokes the vedi with a mantra 
' Having beoome the earth, it nourished greatness &o. ' (Tai. 
Br. III. 7. 6). The adhvaryu addresses a mantra mt (Tai. S. 

I. 1. 9 ) to the vedi ' O virapsin 1 Before the cruel ( Araru ) 
creeps out &o. ', holds the sphya in a slanting position in a 
spot which is beyond § of the length of the vedi from its

barhis ( kusa grass ), clean the sruva and the sruc ladles, gird 
up the wife (of the sacrifioer), and come out with clarified butter.' 
Then the Sgnldhra ( or adhvaryu ) plaoes two pavitras inside 
the agnihotrahavanl (sruo), pours water into it, draws the 
spbya In a slanting position ( from the spot where it had been 
held fixed ) a short distance to the north thereby causing a 
furrowed line on the vedi, holds the sphya in the left hand 
inside the vedi and the agnihotrahavanl in the right hand, drops 
a little water from the agnihotrahavanl on to the furrowed 
line made by the sphya and places the agnihotrahavanl ( con- 
taining the water) on the spot where the sphya had been 
originally held fixed slantingly with ' abode of rta.' The 
adhvaryu brings to his mind him whom the yajamSna hates. 
When the proksanl waters are being placed the yajamftna 
mutters a mantra. The adhvaryu throws the sphya in such a 
way that it falls on the utkara with ' thou art produced from 
a tree, thou hast a hundred points, thou art the death of the 
enemy.' Then seizing the sphya with his fist by the bulging 
part thereof he draws it towards the east from the utkara. He 
washes his hands on the utkara and also the sphya with water 
but does not touch with his bare hand the point of the sphya 
( i. e. he cleans the other parts of the sphya with his hand by 
pouring the water thereon and cleans the point by only pouring 
water thereon ). To the north of the Shavanlya he places with 
both hands the idhma and barhis, the latter to the north of the 
former. The sphya is placed near the pranltS waters to their 
west (Kst. II. 6. 43). 

With the ends of the blades out off in making the veda 
bunch he ( the Sgnldhra or adhvaryu himself ) wipes the sruva 
and the three ladles viz. juhu, upabhrt and dhruva ), invokes 
them with ' you are not sharpened ( and yet ) you destroy our 
enemies.' He takes up the sruva and the sruo ladles with 
' Agni summons you, who are filled with butter, for the worship

extends the same rule to vikrti sacrifices also. In XII. 1. 29 Jai- 
mini establishes that at the time of dlkss in a Soma sacrifice the wife is 
girt up with the yoktra, a fresh girding up is hence not neoessary in the 
priyanlyff and other isfis that are constituent elements in somaySga.

by rubbing its inside several times and its outside on all sides 
onoe with the tips tm ( of the vedapariv&sanani) and its rod with 
the roots (of the portions of the cut blades) with 'May I not brush 
the place of cows I I clean thee that art strong ( or possessed of 
food) and that subduest enemies ' (Tai. S. 1. 1. 10. 1). He cleans 
the juhu ladle, the bowl by rubbing its inside several times 
from west to east with the tips ( of the cut portions ), its outside 
from east to west with the middle portions and its rod with the 
roots with ' may I not brush out speech and life-breatb, I 
clean thee &o." He cleans the upabbrt, the inside from east to 
west ( as for sruva ), the outside from west to east with 
the middle portions and the rod with the roots with ' may I not 
rub out the eye and the ear, I clean thee &o.' He cleans the 
dhruva ladle as he did the sruva, with the difference that 
the mantra is ' may I not rub out progeny and home &o.' He 
does not allow a cleaned vessel to come in oontaot with one 
that is not cleaned, but if they are brought in oontaot he again 
heats the vessel (already cleaned) and cleans it again. He takes 
up the vessel called prasitraharana, ,83 " heats it on the fire ( but 
without mantras ) and cleans it, the bowl with the tips ( of cut 
blades ) on all sides from the outside to the inside and the rod 
with the roots * with may I not brush out food, progeny and 
prosperity, I clean thee that art strong and subduest enemies '. 
According to Ap. II. 4. 10 and com. on Sat. I. 7 p. 158 the sruo 
ladles and the prasitraharana are laid on darbhas in front of 
the utkara or to its west on the north side of the vedi. He

which the vessels were oleaned and offers them into that fire mo 
( garhapatya or Shavanlya ) on which the vessels were heated 
with ' this artistic thing ( the darbba that springs from water ) 
spread down from heaven, it resorts to the spaces of the earth ; 
we destroy our enemy with it that has a thousand shoots, 
svaha! * (Tai.Br. III. 3. 2). 

Then comes patnisarhnahana ( girding up of the sacrifioer's 
wife ). 

The agnldhra takes up the veda bunoh, the ayasthali, mi 
yoklra, and the two darbha blades used as pavitra. The wife ( of 
the sacrificer ), while sitting to the south-west of the garhapatya 
with knee raised up or standing is girt up by the agnldhra ( by 
the adhvaryu, according to com. on A.p. II. 5. 6 ) with the yoktra 
(cord of munja grass) with the mantra, ' I hoping for a favour- 
ably disposed mind, progeny, good luck, beautiful body and 
observing the vratas of Agni, gird up myself for meritorious 
actions' (Tai. S. L 1. 10. 1 ). In modern practice the wife girds 
up her waist with the yoktra herself. He does not gird her up 
over the garment worn round the waist but inside it ( £p. II. 5. 5 
says there is an option). The yoktra has a loop at one end in 
whioh the other end is inserted and the cord is passed round the 
waist of the wife twice, a knot like that of the top-knot (sikha of 
a man) is made to the north of the navel with ' may PQsan tie 
a knot for you' and it is drawn to the south of the navel from 
left to right. She waits upon (does adoration to) the garha- 
patya by standing and saying 'O fire, Lord of the house, call 
me near*. Standing to the west of the garhapatya she pays 

2340. Acoording to Est. II. 6. 50 the cut blades used in scouring 
the vessels are thrown on the utkara. Ap. II. 5. 1 gives an option. 

2341. The Kjyasthffli is a pot in which clarified butter is taken with 
a mantra after the pavitra blades are placed therein and from which the 
■mo ladles are filled. The yoktra is a triple ( having three strands ) oord 
of munja grass with which the waist of the sacrifioer's wife is girt with a 
mantra by the Sgnldhra at the direction of the adhvaryu in sacrificial 
rites. The wife is made fit for participation in the sacrifice by being 
girt up. Vide Tai. Br. III. 3. 3 • sfTCTHreT *W*Wt»rtTni i mrr*t<brt fatii

have no widowed state just as Indranl has none. 8848 May I have 
good sons like Aditi I O garhapatya endowed with all means, 
I sit down near thee for good progeny ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). 
On sitting down Bhe mutters ( japati ,M * ) * fire I we, who have 
virtuous hushands and who have good progeny, who are not 
treated with oontempt, have sat down near thee, that destroyest 
enemies and that cannot be destroyed ( Tai. S. I. 1. 10. 1-2 ) ; 
may my sons be destroyers of enemies and my daughter be 
ruling ( a queen ); I also am victorious ( over my co-wives ) and 
my glory with my husband is highest ( Rg. X 159. 3 ). ' The 
Sgnldhra opens the mouth of the big jar ( covered with a 
piece of cloth or the like ) in which ghee has been stored with 
' may Pusan open thy mouth ' and takes from it into another 
vessel ghee that should be a little more than what would be 
required in the rite, heats it on the daksioa fire with ' Visou 
traversed this * ( Rg. I. 22. 17 ). He takes up from the spot 
where all utensils have been placed the Sjyasthall (pot for 
clarified butter ) with ' thou art Aditi, whose pavitra is not cut 
off' and pours into that pot in which two pavitras are placed 
plenty of clarified butter '**' ' thou art the milk of the great 
ones (the cows), the fluid of herbs, I take out from thee that art 
inexhaustible a portion for the worship of gods ( this is the nir« 
vSpa of clarified butter ). He melts the butter in the ajyasthsll 
on the burning coals of the southern portion of the gSrhapatya 

2342. The region of the wives of the goda is to the west of the 
gSrhapatya.

fire with ' to thee for sap *, takes it down ( from the coals ) with 
• to thee for strength ', holds it oyer the veda bunob and bands 
both the pot and the veda bunoh to the wife. She first closes 
her eyes and then holding her breath (opens her eyes and) looks 
down on the clarified butter with 'thou art the milk of oows ; the 
fluid of herbs, I look on thee for seouring good progeny with 
an invincible eye ' ( Tai. S. I. 1. 10. 3 ). The Sgnldhra places 
the ajyasthall on the northern portion of the garhapatya fire 
and melts it with 'thou art light'; he takes it from the fire 
with 'to thee for light* and carries it to the south of the 
Shavanlya with ' follow after light '. He melts it on that fire 
with 'may Agni not remove thy light'. He takes up the pot 
and returns by the way be went and places it with a mantra 
'thou art the tongue of Agni' (Tai S. I. 1. 10. 3 ) to the north 
of the prokganl waters on the line drawn with the sphya. 

The adhvaryu and the yajamana both close their eyes, 
holding their breath, (open their eyes and) look down upon the 

clarified butter with 'thou art ajya, thou art truth may I 

partake of thee ' ( a long mantra from Tai. S. I. 6. 1. 1-2 ). 
The adhvaryu purifies (performs utpavana of) the ajya thrice 
with two pavitras ,8 *' the points of whioh are held towards the 
north by continuously carrying them backwards and forwards 
with 'thou art bright, thou art the flame, thou art light' ( Tai. 
S. I. 1. 10. 3 ). He performs utpavana of the proksanl water 
with ' devo vab savitotpunStu &o.' ( Tai. 8. 1. 1. 10. 3 ). The 
adhvaryu fills with the sruva ladle that has no trace of any- 
thing sticking to it and that is held in the right hand clarified 
butter inside the vedi, while holding the sruc together 
with the veda bunch in the left hand. The juhu ladle is 
so held that its bowl is alongside of the hollow of the ajya- 
sthall, that of the upabhrt is near the middle of the ajyasthall 
and the dhruva is on the ground. In the juhu and dhruvS 
four ladlings are made with sruva while in the upabhrt eight 
are made'** 7 , but the upabhrt contains the smallest portion 
of ajya, the juhu contains a good deal and the dhruva contains 

2346. The com. on Sat. I. 7. p. 165 explains how thil particular 
utpavana ii done ' snii<HWJl <rftrsl l«TT3n*r*rn*7 «rrurrtf wVwt 5*j TSff- 
ymrpfo' «"ft smhffcjTTft* a<ny qifr I '. The ?gvedins move the 
pavitras from the west to the east only. 

2347. There are various views about the number of times Ijya is 
poured with the truoa into the three ladles ( sruo ). Vide Ap. II. 7. 4-6, 
Sat. 1. 7 pp. 165-167. The general rule is stated above. 



Oh. XXX ] Dcaria-PurvamUsa 1043 

the largest quantity. When the juhu is being filled the mantras 
are four 'sukram tva. ..grhnami paficanam tva...dhattraya 
grhnami ' ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 10. 3 and I. 6. 1. 2-3 ); in the case of 
the upabhrt the mantras are eight 'paficanam tvartttnam... 
suvlryaya tva.. . grhnami '; in the case of the dhruva the 

mantras are ' suprajastvaya tva grhnami devatabhyo 

grhnami ' (Tai. 8. 1. 6. 1. 3 ). The yajamana also invokes with 
the same mantras when the ladling is going on. The adhvaryu 
removes the ajyasth&ll together with the veda and sruva from 
the vedi, keeps the ajya in some place other than the utkara, 
invokes the proksanl waters with 'the divine waters (apo devlr 
&C Tai. 8. I. 1. 5. 1 ) and seeks the permission of the brahma 
priest with ' brahman, shall I sprinkle.' When the brahma says 
'yes' he sprinkles thrice the idhma (fire-wood brought, vide 
p.1014 above), the veda bunch and the vedi, each with a separate 
mantra ( from Tai. 8. 1. 1. 11. 1 ). He places the whole bundle 
of barhis with the knot to the east inside the vedi with a (aautra) 
mantra ' we had recourse to barhis &o. ' and sprinkles the tips, 
the middle portions and the roots of the barhis respectively with 
' to thee for heaven ', * to thee for the aerial region ', ' to thee for 
the earth. * While the sprinkling proceeds the yajamana repeats 
a verse ' may the waters and herbs be well disposed to the 
yajamana &o. ' ( Ap. IV. 6. 1 ). He dips the tips of the barhis 
in the water contained in the agnihotra-havanl and then the 
roots also. He sprinkles over the knot of the barhis from east 
to west water from the sruc over which he places his hand ( so 
that water oozes over it from his finger tips ) with ' to you for 
nourishment * ( Tai. S. VII. 1. 11 ). He pours down the remain- 
ing proksanl water from the southern oorner ( sroni ) of the 
west side of the vedi to its north corner with ' svadha to the 
pitrs, mayst thou be strength for the barhisad pitrs, may you 
( the particles of water ) go to the earth with strength * and the 
yajamana says ' this is for the Barhisad pitrs. ' 

Now comes barhirastarava (strewing the vedi with kusa 
grass). He loosens the knot of the bundle of barhis with 
'may Pusan loosen thy knot'. He takes in his hand the pras- 
tara bunoh drawing it towards the east slowly from the bundle 
of barhis (as if towards the ahayanlya) with 'thou art the 
crest (sttlpa) of visnu i e. yajfia (Tai. S. I. 1.11). With' I 
implant prana and apftna in the yajamana' he places the two 
pavitra blades (used in utpavana above) on the prastara, 
hands it over to the brahma priest, who passes it on to the 



1044 History of DharmaiUstra I Oh. XXX 

yajamana who holds it in his hand. He strews darbha M * T * 
grass on the vedi and plaoes the cord that tied the barhis 
thereon with 'God Barhis 1 I strew thee that art soft like 
wool, as a good seat for the gods'. The darbhas are spread in 
three or fire series (or divisions) beginning from the west side 
of the vedi towards the east (or the reverse according to some) in 
such a way that the tips of one set that is already spread oover 
the roots of the next and the grass is so thiokly strewn that the 
ground below cannot be easily seen. When the kusa grass is 
being strewn the yajamfina recites a mantra 'O barhis, that are 

soft like wool, being spread place me in heaven &o. ' 

( Tai. Br. III. 7.6), when the vedi is covered with the middle 
division of the barhis he reoites the mantra 'this young lady 
with four tufts of hair &c* (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ) and when the 
vedi is completely covered he recites a long passage 'May you 

be auspicious to me increase food, strength, spiritual 

lustre, martial brilliance, prosperity, progeny, cattle for me 
&c.'(Tai. Br. III. 7.6).' 

He takes out two blades (to be used later) for the anflyfijas 
and keeps them separately to the east, feeds the ahavanlya with 
fire-wood, takes back the prastara from the hand of the yaja- 
mfina, and while holding the prastara himself places the three 
encircling f uel-stioks (paridhi) round the ahavanlya fire. The 
middle paridhi is placed on darbhas to the west of the 
ahavanlya with the tip towards the north with 8 * 4 * 'thou art 
gandharva &o.\ While the middle paridhi is being placed the 
yajamfina reoites a mantra ( Tai. Br. IIL 7. 6 ). The other two 
paridhis are laid to the south and north of the ahavanlya place 
with their tips to the east, the southern one extending a little 
beyond the ahavanlya place and touching the middle paridhi 
and the northern one also touohes the middle paridhi. The 
yajamfina repeats two long passages when the southern and 
northern paridhis are being laid (portions of which are identioal 

2347 a. According to the Tai. Br. III. 3. 6 barhis represent b human 
beings and the vedi represents the earth. ' *f$« «^om% ■ sjsrr $ wftt I

with that repeated by the yajamana for the middle paridhi). 
The adhvaryu invokes the ahavanlya 'may the sun guard you 
against all injuries whatever' (Tai. S. 1. 1. 11). He plaoes ( in 
the midst of the ahavanlya fire) two samidhs with their ends 
turned upwards on whion the ftgharas ( will be offered later on ), 
one to the south with the mantra ' Fire, the wise one, may we 
kindle thee 6W (vltihotram tva kave &o. Rg. V. 26. 3 or Tai. 
8. 1. 1. 11 ) and the other to the north of it silently. From the 
midst of the barhis he takes two darbhas of equal length, that 
have no blade hhooting from inside of them ; these are called 
vidhrti and are laid down on the barhis strewn on the vedi in the 
middle portion of the latter with their tips turned northwards 
with 'you two are the regulators of people*. When the 
vidhrtis are being laid down the yajamana repeats a long 

passage ' I out off my enemies with the vidhrtis may you 

support life, progeny and cattle in me' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 \ 
The adhvaryu keeps the prastara bunoh on these two vidhrtis 
with 'sit in this abode of Vasus, Rudras and Adityas ' (Tai. S. 
1. 1. 11) and the yajamana repeats a mantra 'this prastara is 
the support of both Prayajas and Anuy&jas &o. ' ( Tai. Br. III. 
7. 6 ). The adhvaryu plaoes the juhu on the prastara in suoh a 
way that its rod will be alongside of the roots of the prastara 
bunoh with a mantra.' 1 * 8 The upabhrt is placed to the north 
of the juhd in suoh a way that its root is very muoh to the 
west of the root of the juhu and it is underneath the vidhrtis, 
and the dhruva is placed to the north of the upabhrt over the 
vidhrtis and its root is very muoh to the west of that of the 
upabhrt The three should not be so placed as to touch each 
other. The yajamana repeats three passages (all from Tai. 
Br. Ill 7. 6 ) addressed to the three ladles when they are being 
placed. The adhvaryu lays down the sruva to the south of the 
juhu (or to the north of the dhruva but a little behind its bowl) 
with ' thou art a bull possessed of strength, I seat thee in the 
extent of vasa^kara '. He places the ftjyasthall also in suoh a 
spot as space would permit. The yajamana repeats a mantra 
for sruva and another for SjyasthSlI (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The 
adhvaryu invokes the ladles (srucs) with 'these sat in the 
world of good deeds ; Visnu I proteot them, proteot the sacrifice

and the lord of sacrifice and me who bring sacrifice' (Tat. 
8. I. 1. 11, Vaj. S. II. 6). He invokes the clarified butter 
with ' you are all-pervading, belong to Visnu and are the 
abodes of FrajSpati'. He takes in his hand the ajyasthall 
together with the sruva and the veda bunch, removes with 
the veda bunch the burning coals from the southern, purodasa 
with ' Here do I remove the mouth from the attacking army ' 
and then removes them also from the northern purodasa. He 
invokes the purodasa with ' O Sun, O Light, shine forth for 
great vigour. ' He spreads a little clarified butter in the puro- 
dasapatrl for each of the two oakes with ' I make a happy seat 
for you, I arrange for a seat full of pleasure with a stream of 
butter ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ) and drops olarified butter over ( i. e. 
performs abhigharana ) the southern purodasa which is intended 
for Agni with ' May Agni whose source is ghee increase ( or be 
pleased ), may he accept the offerings, anoint the holes, anoint 
the skin ; I sprinkle thee that art good looking, that art dear to 
Agni and that securest wealth with the lustre of cattle ( i. e. 
ghee ) for Agni ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ) and drops butter silently 
on the northern purod&sa. If the second offering be s&nnayya 
( instead of a purodasa ) he drops olarified butter over the boiled 
milk with a mantra ' May that self of yours that has entered 
cattle... go to the gods and secure heaven for me who am a 
sacrificer ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). He removes the purodasa into 
the p&trl ( vessel ) from the potsherds without allowing it to 
break up into pieces and without making it roll about with 'this 
baked ( purodasa ) that is moist and has broad prominences, 
that is the protector of the world, that is the generator of 
• thoughts ( or prayers ) comes out for a bath * ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). 
He brushes away the ashes ( sticking on the back of the puro- 
dasa ) with the veda bunch and lays it down in the purodasa- 
pStrl on the butter that has already been sprinkled over it with 
' Sit on that, be firmly placed in neotar, O offering, that art the 
essence of rice grains,*" with a favourable mind ' ( Tai. Br. 
III. 7. 5 ). He sprinkles clarified butter over it a second time 
and keeps it aside with ' mayst thou be strong. ' 

He sprinkles clarified butter over each of the potsherds ( on 
which the purodasa was baked ), counts them and keeps them 
aside with ' may not prosperity in the form of food and the 
flavour of earth pass away ' ( Tai Br. IIL 7. 5 ). He anoints 

2350. Xp. II. 11. 2 says that if the purodasa is made of barley floor 
he does not repeat the mantra ai the word 'rice ' oooori therein. 



Cfa. XXI 1 Earia-PUrvamSsa 1047 

both the purodasas with butter with 'may god Savitr anoint 
thee with honey * ( the mantra is repeated twice ), the upper part 
being anointed by the sruva ladle with plenty of ghee in such 
a way that there are no mere drops of ghee on it as there are 
specks on the baok of the tortoise ( but the ghee is well spread 
over the whole surface ) and that the lower skin of the purodasa 
is anointed with ghee by the right hand. He lays down the two 
purodasas to the west of the srucs, that for Agni being to the 
south and the other being to the north with ' may you occupy 
this loved -seat by your lovable lustre. ' If sannayya is to be 
offered, he brings together (makes them touch each other) in the 
middle of the vedi the two jars of it and then keeps them 
separate, the one containing the boiled milk on the southern 
oorner of the west side of the vedi and that containing curds on 
the northern corner thereof. When the sannayya is being thus 
placed the yajamana repeats a verse ' yasta atma ' &o. ' ( Tai. 
Br. III. 7. 5 ) and repeats a mantra ( from Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ) 
invoking the purodasa for Agni, that for Agnlsoma ( or Indra 
and Agni ), the hot milk, the curds ( the sannayya in cases 
where it is offered ). 

The adhvaryu lays down the veda bunoh in front of the 
dhruva ladle with ' this veda sought the earth that was con- 
cealed &o. * ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ), strews darbhas round the 
corners of the vedi, 8m and prepares the seat for the hotr 
which is to the north of the northern ' sroni ' of the vedi 
and the darbhas spread on the seat have their points turned 
eastwards or northwards. The adhvaryu invites the hotr in the 
words ' O Hotr t come*. The hotr priest sits down to the north- 
east of the ahavanlya with face to the east, performs acamana 
with the sacred cord in the upavlta form, enters the sacrificial 
ground (vihara) by the way called tirtha (vide p. 984 above). 
He enters with his right foot first, plants his heel alongside of 
the northern sroni and steps upon the barhia ( spread on the 
vedi) with his toes, spreads out the fingers of both hands which 
he joins together and holds them on a level with his heart, looks 
straight at the horizon ( and neither upwards nor downwards) 
and stands faoing the east. This is always the position of the 
limbs of the body in the case of the hotr unless there be any 
express direction to the contrary. The adhvaryu takes a 
aamidh from the idhma and issues a direction to the hotr ' reoite

for Agni that is being kindled*. The hot? reoites ' salutation to 
the expounder, salutation to the supervisor, salutation to him 
who reports, who will repeat (or respond to) this? He will 
repeat this. May the six broad ( or great ) ones, viz. heaven and 
earth, day and night, waters and plants save me from sin. 
Speech has stood firm ( and so has ) yajfia. I shall deal with 
( t e. recite ) the metres well. I resort to myself so and so ( here 
the hotr utters his name in the objective oase ). In the past 
and in future, as to things born and to be born I have recourse 
to(Agni) who is apavya(?). Bring me the non-cessation of 
speech'. So saying he contraots his fingers towards himself 
and then extends them as before by saying 'O fire! make the 
oattle take delight in me'. ( Then he should proceed ) ' Heaven 
and earth are my armour. Fire is my armour, the Sun is my 
armour and may the intermediate quarters be my armour ! O 
godsl I shall to-day reflect over that highest part of speech, 
whereby we may vanquish the asuras ; five people, who 
deserve sacrifices and food accept my offering."" Having 
finished this japa, the hotr sets about repeating the Samidhenl 
verses. 8 *** The yajamana repeats the daia-hotr mantras before 
the samidhenls ( vide note 2247 for dasahotrs). First he utters 
the syllable 'Mm' thrice (or once) and the mystic words , bhur 
bhuvah svarom* are muttered inaudibly by him. ,m Then 
eome the samidhenl verses. The samidhenl verses are (vide 
iav. I. 2. 7) eleven viz. Bg. III. 27. 1, VI. 16. 10-12, III. 27. 
13-15, L 12. 1, IIL 27. 4, V. 28. 5-6. But fifteen samidhenl 
verses are to be repeated in Darsa-purnamasa and the number 
fifteen of the verses is obtained by repeating each of the first 
( pra vo vftja, Jig. HI. 27. 1 ) and the last verse ( a juhota 



2352. The passages wr; sw*^ «rw &&[% gwisr. constitute the 

entire jopo which the hotr mutters, the last clause being Bg. X. 63. 4. 
This last is explained in Nirukta III. 8. The words «m: «*** &o., are a

Bg. V. 28. 6 ) thrice. They are all to be repeated in the same 
pitoh m * (not minding udatta, anudatta or svarita accents) 
i. e. ekairuti. Jaimini IX. 1. 33 states that whatever rk is the 
first or last ( whether ' pra vo vaja ' &o. or any other ) is to be 
repeated thrice (i. e. repetition three times is an attribute 
due to the plaoe of a verse and it is not an attribute 
of any particular verse ). The syllable ' om ' is to be added at 
the end of each verse and the adhvaryu sitting down near 
the ahavanlya throws into the ahavanlya fire a samidh the 
moment ' om ' is uttered by the hotr at the end of a verse. The 
saorificer then utters at each samidh 'agnaya idamnamama'. 
In this way when eleven samidhs have been offered, all the 
remaining samidhs (except one kept aside for the anuyUjas) 
are offered into the fire the moment the last verse but one 
( viz. samiddho agna, Rg. V. 28. 5 ) or the last verse ( a juhota, 
Rg. V. 23. 6) is recited. Asv. ( I. 2. 8-22) gives detailed rules 
about how these samidhenl verses are to be recited. The note 
below would illustrate the method of their recital. MM The 
hotr repeats the nigada 'Ofire, you are great, you are brah- 
mana (the impulse to prayers), you are Bharata ( the sustainer)' 
in such a way as to join it with the last ' om ' repeated after 
the last samidhenl verse and then makes a stop. Then the

hotr invokes the names of the pravars sages 81 " of the saorifioet 
as many as he may have (1, 2, 3 or 5), the most remote one 
being first uttered, then the more remote and so on. In the 
oase of a ksatriya or a vaisya saorifioer, the invocation is made 
of the pravara sages of the purohita of the saorifioer or of 
the names 'Manava, Ails, Paururavasa* or of ' Manava' 
for all in case of doubt ( Asr. I. 3. 3-5 ). He then proceeds 
' (Agni) that was kindled by the Gods and by Manu, that 
was sung by the sages, whom wise men gladdened, that was 
praised by the sages, that was aroused by prayers, that is offered 
ghee, the bringer ( or leader ) of sacrifices, the charioteer of sacri- 
fices, the unobstructed hotr, the swift carrier of offerings'. 
He takes breath here and proceeds ' thou art the mouth and 
the vessel of the gods, the juhu of the gods, a camasa ( cup ) 
with whioh the gods drink; O fire! as the spokes are centered 
in the felly, so tbou encompassest the gods, bring the gods 
to this sacrificer '. tm Then he calls upon Agni to bring 
the several deities, viz. Agni, Soma, Agni, Prajapati, Agnl- 
somau, the ghee-drinking gods and adds * bring Agni for 
the holra (the function or office of hotr), bring thy own 
greatness, O Jatavedas (fire), bring and sacrifice with a 

2357. Vide notes 1139-1140 about reoiting the names of the 
pravara sages. For example, if the gotra of the sacrificer is 6sijdilya 
the hotr repeats §Sndila, Asita, Devala ; if it be Vatsa, he repeats 
BhSrgava, CySvana, SpnavSna, Aurva, Jsmadagnya. Agni is here 
invoked to help the sacrificer as the summoner of the gods on this 
occasion, as he did help the illustrious ancestors of the sacrificer. Vide 
Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. pp. 479-480 ( note ) and S. B. E. vol. 18 p. 115

is part of the nigada. He takes breath at the end of the pravara words.

These are the deities in this invocation in purnaroasa but in

Having thus invoked the deities ( i. e. the whole of the 
invocation up to this is done standing ), the hot? sits down with 
knees raised up, removes the kusa ( on the vedi ) to its north 
and measures the space of a span on the vedi with ' Aditi is his 

mother, do not cut him off from the air, with yajna, with 

vasa^kara as the thunderbolt I kill him who hates us and whom 
we hate ' ( Asv. I. 3. 22 ). The yajamana repeats a verse ' fire in 
whom offerings have been thrown is kindled &c. ' ( Ka^haka 
Sam. IV. 14 ), when the fire flames up with the fuel-sticks that 
are offered and another mantra 'Gods and pitrs, whatever I may 
be I sacrifice &o.' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 5) is repeated. He fans after the 
deities are summoned as above the ahavanlya fire thrioe with the 
veda bunch. He while sitting takes clarified butter from the dhru- 
va ladle with the sruva, holds it on the veda, passing the sruva 
over the north-west corner (of the ahavanlya) where the two pari- 
dhia meet he pours,**' while revolving in his mind the mantra 
'to Prajapati Manu, svaha', a continuous, long and straight stream

of clarified butter on the fire bursting into flames in the ahava- 
nlya place towards the south-east and makes all the fuel-sticks 
( already thrown over the fire ) come in contaot with ( the butter 
so poured ). The yajamSna says ' this is for Prajapati ' and 
invokes the butter poured as Sghara with ' thou art the mind of 
Frajapati, enter into me with mind. ' Taking Sjya from the 
ajyasthall in the sruva he strengthens ( or increases or adds to ) 
the dhruva with ' let the dhruva be strengthened with ghee &o. ' 
( Tai. S. I. 6. 5. 1 ). He then issues a direction to the agnldhra 
' Agnldhra, clean thrice each of the paridhis and the fire.' The 
agnldhra holds the tying cords of the idhma on the sphya and 
silently cleans ( or wipes ) the paridhis with them in the order 
in which they were placed ( round the fire ) from their roots to 
the tips i. e. he cleans the middle one first, moving with his 
right towards the paridhi from the north with his face towards 
the east; then he cleans the southern one by going to the south 
in front of the Shavanlya ; then he oleans the northern paridhi 
by going from behind ( the west of ) the shavanlya towards the 
north ; then he returns by the way he went to his usual place 
and wipes the fire thrice, once with the mantra, * O fire, that 

securest strength (or food) I I wipe thee that eatest food for 

the sake of food * ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ) and twice silently. When 
about to make the Sghara he folds his hands in adoration to the 
gods with his fingers to the east in front ( i. e. to the east of ) 
tho juhu and upabhrt with 53 ' 1 O fire 1 thou art the world, spread 
in all directions ; O sacrificer ( Agni ), adoration to thee ' ( Tai. 
S. 1. 1. 12. 1). He folds his hands towards the south in adora- 
tion with ' to the pitrs, svadha. ' He then touches water and 
takes up the juhu in the right hand with ' juhu 1 come, Agni 
summons thee for .the worship of the gods' and takes the upabhrt 
in the left hand with ' O upabhrt 1 come, god Savitr calls thee 
for the worship of gods * ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 12. 1 ). He places the 
upabhrt on juhu with ' O well-controlling ones, may you two 
abound in ghee to-day for me, may you be well oovered and 
well surrounded ' ( compare Vaj. S. II. 7 ). He takes the juhu 
from under the upabhrt to the east completely and holds it on 
the upabhrt in suoh a way that their bowls are placed on each 
other and when be is about to throw the ajya into fire he merely 
holds the upabhrt in his left and holding the juhu in his right 

2361. Though the mantra is addressed to Agni alone, as Agni 
comprehends in himself all gods, it may be said to be meant for all 
' gods.

makes the offering with it. 11 " He crosses over to the south of 
the ahavanlya with the right foot but without treading upon 
the prastara and after repeating the mantra 'O Agni and Visnu ! 
May I not step down on you 1 May you become apart from me! 
May you not cause trouble ( or heat ) to me ; may you, who are 
the makers of worlds, make a plaoe ( or world ) for me ' ( Tai. S. 
I. 1. 12 and Tai. Br. III. 3. 7 ). He stands to the south of the 
ahavanlya with ' thou art the seat of Visnu; from here lndra 
performed his exploits * ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 12 ). He places his right 
foot inside the vedi and makes the toes of the left foot touch 
the heel of the right. Then inserting the juhu by the point 
where the southern paridbi joins the middle one ( i. e. from the 
south-west) he, while standing, pours from it towards the 
north-east ( as in the first ) a continuous stream of ajya with 
' having well begun, the sacrifice of the sacrificer, which is to 
rise ( i. e. to bring prosperity ), which is uninjured and which is 
offered to lndra, touohes heaven ; svSha ' ( Tai. 8. I. 1. 12 ) and 
makes the ghee come in contact with all the fuel-sticks (idhma) 
thrown into the fire. The yajamSna says 'this is for lndra.' The 
adhvaryu, after making this offering (the 2nd SghSra), lets out his 
breath which he had held up at the time of making the offering. 
After pouring ajya over the fire he raises up the juhu over the 
ahavanlya with ' ( fire ) is kindled pre-eminently. ' He crosses 
over to the north separating the juhu and upabhrt with ' save 
me, O fire, from evil (or sin) and establish me in good deeds' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 12 ). With the ijya in the juhu he smears the 
dhruva tbrioe, once with ' ghee is anointed by fire, sacri- 
fioial offering is anointed by sacrificial offering, the aerial 
regions are anointed by fire- flame' and twice silently. He 
takes ajya from the dhruva ladle with the sruva and sprin- 
kles it over 886 * the (ajya in the) juhu with 'suvlrfiya 
svaha ' and sprinkles ajya from the juhu over that in the 
dhruva with ' saorifice is spread continuously by saorifioe '. 



2362. I p. ( II. 13. 5-6 ) and Sat. ( II. 1. pp. 181-182) say that this is 
the mode of holding the two ladles in all Shutis (he alao hold* the two 
on a level with his navel ). 

2363. Anointing (tamahjana) is done by sprinkling a drop, but 
pratyabhighSrana requires that Bjya should be poured in a stream how- 
ever slight, 'ws* f^lwrsms^oT «rwfvnnT>t ftft^wm^ft $%*t-

i054 History of Dharmainstra [ Ch. XX X 

After keeping the two ladles (juhu and dhruva) in their 
proper places, he (the adhvaryu ) sets about choosing (invoking ) 
the pravara. The adhvaryu brings in contactjwith ( twines 
round ) the sphya the tying cords of the idhma and one 
blade from the the kusas strewn on the vedi and stands to 
the north of the vedi (or near the utkara) for reoiting the 
pravara mantra. He faces the south (the east according to 
com. on Eat. III. 2. 3 ). The agnldhra stands to the west of the 
adhvaryu faoing the south near the utkara. The adhvaryu 
then inaudibly utters a formula ' who will become the adhva- 
ryu here? He will become the adhvaryu here. Yajfia(willbe 
adhvaryu) of yajfia, I stand in the abode of Visnu. May 
speech perform the function of a priest, may mind do so, I 
resort to speech. Bhuh bhuvah suvah I ' ( Ap. II. 15. 1 and Sat. 
II. 1. p. 186). The agnldhra after touching the binding cords 
of idhma, the sphya and the kusa blade also inaudibly repeats a 
similar mantra 'who will become the agnldhra here &o. ' ( Ap. 
II. 15. 2 ). The adhvaryu addresses the brahma priest ' 
brahman I shall I call on ( the agnldhra ) to listen to the pra- 
vara?' The brahmS priest first repeats inaudibly 'O lord of 
speeohl make (him) listen to this speech, make the sacrifice be 
heard among gods, and me among men ( Ap. III. 19. 3 ) ; sustain 
these deities in heaven &c. ' and then loudly says ' yes, do 
make him listen ( om3asrS3vaya ). The adhvaryu says 3iu ' &3 
sravaya' ( make to listen) and the agnldhra holding the sphya 
oovered with the binding cord responds with ' astu srau3saV 
( lit. yes, let him hear). The adhvaryu then utters ' May Agni, 
the divine hotr, the wise one, the discriminating one, saorifice 
for the gods, like Manu, like Bharata, like that one, like that 
one. Let him bring (the gods) to the accompaniment of holy 
prayer. The brahmanas are the proteotors of this saorifice. 



2364. The call of the adhvaryu in the form ' drSvaya ' ( f or s 6s- 
vaya) is technically called ' ssrSvana ' or ' Irfruta ', while the response 
of the Ignldhra in the form ' astu 4rau3saj; ' is oalled ' pratyKsrSvana ' or 
' pratytfruta '. Vide Sat. Br. I. 5. 2. 6-7 where, to explain these two 
words, a legend is narrated of the sacrifice fleeing from the gods. The 
formula uttered by the adhvaryu is either an3*ri3**i or 9ft3«rr3vq' accord- 
ing to Sat. II. 1. p. 186 and according to Ap. II. 15. 3 it is also simply 
«n3*tr or wf3*rr3*V. Vide P5n. VIIT. 2. 91-9* for the pluta. The airtfVn 
responds with w*$ t&W^. 



Oh. XXX ] DariapUrifamaaa-holrvararta 1055 

This (so and so by name) is the human hotr\ ,m While the 
adhvaryu is engaged in the fisravana call the hotr should follow 
him with an .invocation 'make the sacrifice heard among gods, 
and make me heard among men for fame, glory and spiritual 
eminence ' (As v. I. 3. 23). When the adhvaryu chooses the 
hotr (in the words 'so and so is the human hotr') the hotr 
should repeat 'God Savitrl they here choose thee that art 
fire for the office of hotr together with thy father Vaisvanara. 
May Heav.en and Earth protect me. Agni is the (divine) hotr, 
I am the human hotr ' (Asv, I. 3. 23). He gets up with a mantra 
' udayusS &c.' (Tai. S. I. 2. 8. 1 ) and on getting up recites 'O 
adhvaryu 1 sixty plus ninety ohains are spread near (or inside) 
Agni, the hotr. They bind the ignorant, (but) the wise one 
goes beyond ( overcomes) them ' ( Asv. 1. 3. 24 ). Having approa- 
ched the adhvaryu with ' I, a hotr priest, follow the path of rta ' 
( Asv. I. 3. 25 ) the hotr should touch the adhvaryu on the 
latter's shoulder with his right hand that hangs by his side 
and the agnldhra also with his left with ' we touch Indra as the 
purohita in this rite of choosing the hotr, whereby the gods 
reached the'highest Heaven and the Angirases also did so ' 
( Asv. I. 3. 27 ). He should wipe ( purify ) his face thrice with 
the blades used in binding the idhma, once with ' thou art a 

2365. The adhvaryu mutters the name of the hotr but the word 
' mBnusah ' is loudly uttered and the first vowel in it is made pluta. The 
Sat. Br. I. 5. 1. 5-13 sets out the pravara-mantra and explains it:

modes of taking the pravara names, one with affix <$% (where the first sage 
mentioned is tie most remote, the next comes after him in time) 
and the other mode by taddbita formation where the latest among the 
pravara sages is mentioned first as in t'Mi«sii'W'Jui*h?i%i& Jai. 
( VI. 1. 43 ) asserts that one who has not three pravara sages is not 
eligible for performing dardaptirnamSsa. JLp. II. 16. 12 and XXIV. 10. 18 
and Sat. II. 1. p. 188 give rules about the pravara names of royal sacri- 
fioers and of those who have two gotras and state that some held that

cleaner ( or purifier ), purify me together with my progeny and

standing to the west of the seat and with face to the east, 
address the seat of hotr (Asv. I. 3. 30) with 'away, 
O daidhisavya &o. ' ( vide above p. 1021 ). He should take a 
blade of kusa from the hotr's seat with the thumb and the finger 
next to the smallest and oast it away to the south-west with 
* the demon that keeps off wealth is oast aside. ' With ( As v. 
I. 3. 31 ) ' here do I like a horse sit down in the seat of vasu ' 
(wealth) he should sit down, the right leg being placed on the 
left one. He Bits down with ' God barhis, may I sit down on 
thee that occupiest a good seat* (Asv. I, 4. 7). With the cap 
of his knee he touches the barhis (spread on his seat) with 'O 
Hotr! May you pre-eminently occupy the barhis' (Asv. 1. 4. 8). 
Then he mutters (performs japa of) oertain texts viz: 'bhu- 

pataye namah chandamsi prapadye' (Asv. I. 4. 9), Rg. 

X. 158. 1, I. 27. 13, X. 52. 1, X. 53. 2 and 4. When the japa is 
finished and the fuel-stioks ( idhma ) thrown on to the fire are 
blazing he should make the adhvaryu hand over to him the two 
srucs with this prose formula (nigada) 'may Agni, the hotr, 
know (undertake) the duty of hotr, that gives protection. O 
saorificer 1 The deity is well disposed to you in that you have 
ohosen Agni as the hotr*. He should finish the nigada (Asv. 

I. 4. 11) 'Hold the adhvaryu's sruc that abounds in ghee, 
that is devoted to the gods and is possessed of all boons ; let us 
praise the gods that deserve praise, let us bow to them that 
deserve adoration and offer saorifice to the gods that deserve it ' 
(Asv. I. 4. 11). 

The adhvaryu, when the hotr sits down, throws down on 
the vedi the blade of grass (that was brought in contact with 
the sphy a ). MM The yajamana says ' O gods and pi^rs, O pitrs 
and gods &c.\ The yajamana should repeat the Caturhotr 
mantras before the prayajas are offered ( vide note 2248 ). 

The adhvaryu takes the juhu and upabbrt, crosses from 
behind the paridhis to the south of the vedi with the right foot 
first and facing the north-east offers the five prayaja oblations 
of clarified butter beginning to the west of the place. where the 
two streams of the Sgharas meet and ending in the east (Ap. 

II. 17. 1 ) or he offers the five offerings In the four principal 
quarters from the east to the north respectively and the last in

ofprayljaa is as follows .-— Mw First he says '&3srt3vaya\ 
the Sgnldhra standing near the utkara facing the south and 
holding the sphya makes the response ' astu srau3sat '. Then 
the adhvaryu' gives a direotion to the hotr with reference to the 
first prayaja 'Samidho yaja' (recite the yajya verse for the 
deity Samidhah ). The hotr recites "Whoever we are, we 
sacrifice to the deity samidhah ; may the samidhs, O fire, par- 
take of the Sjya. Vau3aaV'. When the Bound vasa^ is heard 
the adhvaryu offers ajya from the juhu towards the eastern and 
the most blazing part of the ahavanlya fire. He may either 
occupy the same position or proceed eastwards as he offers each 
offering. Jai. III. I. 19-20 deals with this question viz. that he 
may offer the prayajas 83 ' 8 by proceeding eastwards. After each

and are oblations of Sjya introductory to the prinoipal offerings and 
anuynjai ( that are only throe in DarsapOrnamasa ) are offered subse- 
quent to the principal offerings. The prayaja offerings are addressed 
to five viz. , wfoiiit , ffqjmn ( or smsfar ), *g: ( or ?3&: ), *ftt, WlfntTO 
( or wnnmi i ). Jai. ( V. 1. 4-7 ) enjoins that praySjas must be offered 
in the order of the text viz. first to Samidhah and ao on, and II. 2. 2 
declares that with eaoh repetition of tho word ' yajati ( used five times ) 
there is a separate unseen result (adrsta or apHrva ). The three deities 
of the anuyKjas are srffs, snrrem, wfj* f^TOEt*. The word is written either 
as wa*rnT ( 9g. X. 61. 8-9 ) or ai^rtgr ( Ap. II. 9. 8 and elsewhere ). 
According to Ait. Br. 7. 3 WTTTg t HT : means ft^^T:. In the 
Nirukta VIII. 22 there is a discussion as to the devatSs of 
prayBjas and anuyBjas and after mentioning several views Ysska 
states his own opinion that they are 'Bgneya' i. e. they are the 
different forms {Tana) of Agni. Jaimini (IX. 2. 59-60 ) holds that the 
words 'Samidhah', 'TanflnapSt* &o. are really the names of a rite, that 
they do not convey that Samidhs, TanBnapBt and others are deities and 
that the mantras repeated by the hotr oonvey the devata, whioh is Agni. 
The oom. on Sat. II. 1. p. 198 has a long note on this and accepts Jai- 
mini's position. In Tai. S, II. 6. 1 five prayBjas of darsapHrnamBsa are 
mentioned and they are brought in relation to the five seasons. The five 
constituent formulas connected with each of the five prayajas are well

vasatkara the hotr repeats ' speech is energy. He ( vasatkftra ) 
is indeed energy. May prana and apana be in me ' ( Asv. I» 
5. 17 ). The yajamSna says when the first prayaja is offered 
' this is for the Samidhs. I gratify Vasanta among the seasons, 
May he (Vasanta) being gratified gratify me'. The same 
procedure is followed as to the remaining four prayajas 
viz. there is first asrSvana, then pratyftsr&vana by the Sgnldhra, 
praisa to hotr, reoital of the yajya by the hotr with vasat- 
karaatend, offering of fijya into fire by the adhvaryu, the 
ty&ga by the yajam&na and connecting the five prayajas with the 
five rtus ( seasons ) in order from Vasanta ( hemanta and sisira 
being taken as one). The seoond prayaja offering is meant for 
Tanunapat, but those who belong to the Vasistfia, Sunaka, Atri. 
Vadhryasva and Rajanya ( Visvamitra ? ) gotras substitute Nara- 
samsa for TanQnapftt (6an. 1. 7. 3 is slightly different). The whole 
procedure is briefly indioated in Sanskrit in the note below."" 
The first three praySja offerings are made with the ajya in the 
juhu, but as to the 4th ( to Barhis ) he pours half of the ajya 
contained in the upabhrt into the juhu and then makes the 
offering. Wherever there are more prayajas than 5 (e. g. 
in Varuna-praghasa there are nine, in Pasubandha ten ) the 
4th, 7th and 10th are offered in this way ( vide Sat. IE. 2. p. 199 
and KSt. III. 2. 22-23). Vide Jai. IV. 1. 40 and 41-45. 
These mantras ( in the note ) ocour in Tai. Br. III. 5. 5 where 
'viyantu' is substituted for 'vyantu' (as is usual with the 
Taittirlyas ). The words ' ye3 yajamahe ' used at the beginning 
of each yajya are called ' aguh ' ; but there are no such words 
in the anuyajas ( Asv. I. 5. 4 ). Vasatkara is uttered at the end 
of all y&jyfts and in anuyajas also. The yajya is pronounced 
very loudly and with great distinctness as to the ' ye ' of 
'ye yajamahe' and the last syllable of the y&jya is made 
pluta. In Asv. I. 5. 9. 9-14 there are other rules not set 
out here. The pronouncing of vasat was a very solemn and

mystic matter and even in modern times the word is uttered 
very loudly and forcibly. The Ait. Br. XI. 6 says that 'the 
vasa^kSra is a thunderbolt ; when a man utters vasa^kSra he 
should think of his enemy ; thereby he plants the thunderbolt 
on him, ' Asv. L 5. 18 states that vasatkara was to be uttered 
only by day and not by night. There are three tones ( mandra 
madbyama and uttama ). Up to the prayajas and after samyu. 
vfika the mandra tone is employed. After prayftjas up to svis^akrt 
the tone is to be madhyama. Thereafter up to sarhyuvaka it is to 
be high. Vide Asv. I. 5. 25-28 and Asv. I. 5. 4-8 for these and 
several other rules. Asv. II. 15. 12 states that the agub. ( the 
words ye3 yajamahe ), the om ( at the end of an anuvakya ) and 
the vasatkara are pronounced in a high tone everywhere. 

The adhvaryu after the five prayfija offerings comes back 
and pours some ajya mo ( left in the juhu after the praySja offer- 
ings ) over the several offerings ( haviihsi), first over the dhruva, 
then over the purodasas, the boiled milk, the curds in the order 
in which they are sacrificed later on. Lastly be pours a little 
ajya over the upabhrt. He lays down the ladles (sruo). He holds 
them in his hands from the time when he offers the Sjyabhagas 
up till the offering to Agni Sviatakrt. He puts into the juhu 
four ladlings of ajya with the sruva with ' may the dhruva be 
strengthened with ghee in each sacrifice for those who serve the 
gods &c. * ( Tai. S. I. 6. 5. 1 ) and anoints the blades of the 
prastara with a drop of ajya. 

Now follow Ajydbhaga». iVlx The adhvaryu issues a direction 
to the hotr ' recite the anuvakyft ( invitatory ) verse for Agni. ' 

The hotr repeats Rg. VI. 16. 34 ( Agnir-vrtrfini ahutah ) with 

om added at the end. Then there is Ssr&vana by adhvaryu and 
pratyftsravana by Sgnldhra, then the praisa of adhvaryu to the 
hotr to repeat the yajya for Agni. The hotr repeats the yajya 
" may Agni who is favourable ( or pleased ), partake of the 
ajya* preceded by ' ye3 yajamahe' and followed by *vau3 sat.'

On bearing ' vausat ' the adhvaryu offers ajya in the northern 
and most blazing part of the ahavanlya. The yajamSna recites 
' Agni has his eye ( everywhere ). May I become possessed of 
sight by worship offered to him. ' The same procedure is follow- 
ed as to the second fijyabhfiga to Soma which is offered in the 
southern and most blazing part of the ahavanlya fire. In pQrna- 
mSsa the two ajyabhagas are called V&rtraghna and in the 
darses^i they are called ' Vrdhanvantau * ( Asv. I. 5. 32 and 35 ). 
Vide Jai. III. 1. 23. The adhvaryu is on the north side of the vedi 
when he takes up portions of ajya in the juhu and issues the 
direction to recite the anuvakyci from there. Then he crosseB to 
the south of the ahavanlya, performs asrSvana and issues the 
praisa for the recital of the yajya after the Sgnldhra responds 
with ' astu srau3saV The whole prooedure is briefly set out in 
the note below. ,m 

PuronuvakyS and Yajya are required in ajyabhagas, in fivapa, 
in Svistakrt and in Patnlsamyajas, but in prayajas and anuyajas 
there are only yajy8s ( vide Sat. II. 2. p. 189). The puronuvakyft 
is recited by the priest while sitting, while the yajya is recited 
standing and the reoitation of these is only a samskara and 
not a principal act ( vide Jai X. 4. 39-41 ). Four ladlings with 
sruva are made in the juhu for all sacrificers in ajyabhagas and 
other homas, but in the case of sacrificers whose gotra is 
Jamadagnya five (pancavatfca) ladlings are made in the juhu 
( Ap. II. 18. 2, Sat. II. 2 pp. 190-191 ) and one whose gotra is not 
Jamadagnya may have five ladlings after taking the permission 
of a J&madagnya. The puronuvakyas for the ajyabhagas in 
darsestf are Eg. VIII 44. 12 (for Agni) and £g. I. 91. 11 (for 
Soma).

The adhvaryu having gone across (towards the purodSsas 
that are made ready) sprinkles clarified butter on the sruo (juhu) 
with ' apyfiyat&ra dhruva &o.' ( vide p. 1059 above ), touches the 
several sacrificial offerings with 'do not be afraid, do not tremble, 
may I not injure thee ; may not thy lustre leave thee ; carry 
across this sacrifioer who brings offerings, rain on the earth, in 
order I shall offer the cut portions; I make an adoration to you, do 
not injure me ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). mi With his thumb and two 
fingers (viz. the middle and anSmika, but using only the fleshy 
parts and not the nails) he cuts off a portion from the middle of 
the purodasa ( oake) meant for Agni and from its front half. 
Sat. II. 2. p. 191 and 5p. II. 18. 9 say that the avadana (portion 
out or severed) is as much as the front joint of the thumb 
( as a general rule ) but that the svistakrt offering is larger than 
the ordinary offering for other deities Bm &c. For the Jama- 
dagnyas a third portion is cut off from the hind part of the 
purodasa. Portions from ajya and sannSyya are taken out with 
the sruva and of cooked food (cam) with the meksana. The por- 
tion cut from the middle is placed in the eastern part of the 
bowl of the sruo and the second portion in the western part of 
the bowl. He sprinkles clarified butter with the sruva ( in 
which ajya is taken from the ajyasthall ) on the cut portions and 
on the purodasa from which they were cut 8278 with ' when cutt- 
ing portions from thee I acted against thee, I anoint that again 
with ajya, may that grow again in thee' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). 
Everytime he offers a fourfold (caturavatta) portion he smears a 
drop of ajya on the blades of the prastara, 

Then follows the principal saorifice. The adhvaryu issues 
a direction to the hotr ' recite an anuvakyS for Agni '. Hotr 
recites (as anuvakya) $g. VIII. 44. 16 followed by * om * ( as

plaoing in the sruo of the two portions cut off from the purodgsa and 
the sprinkling of buttor over the cut portions ( abhighBrana ) constitute 
four items and so are called ' caturavatta.' When three portions are 
cut off from the purodSsa or other offering for Jsmadagnyas then there 
are ( with upastarana and abhighSrana ) Are items ( paficgvatta ).

agnirmurdhft...jinvato3m ). Then there is asravana and pratys- 
sravana. Then the adhvaryu issues his direction to the 
hotr to reoite the yajya which is $g. X. 8. 6 ( ye3 yajama- 
hesgnim bhuvo havyavaho3m vau3sat ). Then the adhva- 
ryu throws the oblation ( ahuti ) of purodasa portions on 
to the fire. The method of this is** 7 * that he drops a part 
of the ajya from the sruo first ( that was sprinkled in 
it at upastarana and abhigharana ), then the two purodasa 
portions are thrown and lastly he allows the remaining 
ajya from the bill-like mouth of the sruo to flow over the 
purodasa offerings as if covering them but without disturbing 
them. The principal ahutis are introduced at the point of 
the confluence of the two aghSras and each one is offered 
in the ahavanlya to the east ( or north-east ) of the preceding 
one but in oontaot with the latter. The yajamana makes the 
tydga 'this is for Agni' with 'may I have food to eat on account 
of this worship of Agni.' After this offering of purodasa to 
Agni, there is an upamsuyaja ( a silent sacrifioe ) with clarified 
butter offered to Prajapati or to Agnlsomau or Visnu. When 
offered to Prajapati the anuvakya and yajya are Rg. X. 121. 10 
and Tai. Br. IL 8. l ,m ( taveme loka &c.) and when offered to 
Agnlsomau they are Rg. I. 93. 2 and 6. According to Ap. 1. 19. 12 
and Jai. X. 8. 51-61 it is offered only on Paurnamasl. In this, 
the reference to the deity is always inaudible, but even here the 
asruta, the pratyasruta, and two directions for reciting anuvakya 
and yajya and the vasa^kara are uttered loudly. The sacri- 
ficer says in this upSmsuyaja ' thou art a destroyer ; may I be 
uninjured and may I subdue evil.' The offering is made of the 
ajya in the dhruva ( Jai. X. 8. 47-48 ) and the devata is either 
Prajapati or Agni or Visnu ( Jai. X. 8. 49-50 ) and the offering 
is caturavatta ( Jai. X. 8. 33-34 ). The second purodasa is 
offered to Agni and Soma on purnamasa in the same way, the 
anuvakya and yajya being respectively Rg. I. 93. 9 and 5 and 
to Indragnl in darsestf, the anuvakya and yajya being Rg.

sacrificer offers sannayya to Indra the anuvakya and yajya are 
respectively fcg. L 8. 1 and X. 180. 1 and when it is offered to 
Mahendra they are respectively Rg. VIII. 6. 1 and X. 50. V m 
In the case of sannayya he takes two portions of the boiled 
milk and two of curds ( or three of ourd 8 for paficftvattins ) and 
there is upastarana in the sruc only once and abhigharana 
also once. 

After the prinoipal offerings comes the offering to Agni 
Svi?takrt. ,m He sprinkles a little ajya in the sruo, cuts off 
one portion from each of the several remnants of the havis from 
their northern halves in the order in which the several sacrifi- 
cial ingredients are offered to the deities ( twice in the case of 
pafio&vfittins ), sprinkles over these cut portions olarified butter 
twice, but does not sprinkle ajya on the remnants of havis and 
offers them in a spot in the north-east of the fire but not so 
as to come in oontact with the other ahutis already offered 
(viz. ajyabhagas and purodasa). In this also there is the direction 
to repeat anuvakya, recital of anuvakya, asravana, pratyasravana, 
direction for yajya, the yajya itself and vasatkara. The anu- 
vakya for Sviatakrt offering is Rg. X. 2. 1 and the yajya is 
long and is set out below. 8880 The whole of it is to be recited 
without taking breath or he may take breath after reciting 
half of JRg, VI. 15. 14. The yajamana says 'this is for Agni 
Svis^akrt and not mine. May I attain to stability and long life 
by the worship offered to Agni Svistakrt. May Agni protect

me from bad sacrifice (or a curse); may Savitr save me from 
him who speaks evil of me. May I vanquish him who, whether 
far or near, is my enemy 1* (Tai. S. 1. 6. 2. 4). Jai. VI. 4. 3 
lays down that if after portions are cut for Svis^akrt as 
directed they are destroyed accidentally, there is no fresh 
cutting for Svis^akrt again. 

The adhvaryu comes back to the north of the vedi from the 
spot where he offered to Svistakrt, fills the juhu with water and 
pours it round the paridhis ( or their places ) beginning from 
the middle one and proceeding from left to right with ' I offer 
this offering into VaisvSnara, it is a spring with a hundred or 
a thousand streams. May he support in this that is being filled, 
my father, grandfather and great-grandfather* ( Tai. A. VI. 6 ) 
and then touches water. The sacrifioer makes the ty&ga with 
'this is for (my) father &c.' and then touches water. The 
adhvaryu lays down the two srucs in their proper plaoes. Then 
he tears the surface ( or top ) of the purodasa meant for Agni 
from west to east, inserts his thumb and the anftmika ( ring- 
finger ) and takes out from inside the cake a portion which is 
as much as a barley grain or the pippala " 81 berry with ' let 
this be cut off, somewhat bigger than a barley grain or than 
the wound made by an arrow. May we not injure this holy 
and well-offered havis of the sacrifice * ( Tat Br. III. 7. 5 ). He 
takes off a portion from the other purodasa also in the same 
way but without piercing the top. These portions are called 
prasitra. The brahroa priest looks at the prasitra when it is 
being taken out with ' I look at thee with the eye of Mitra • 
( Asv. 1. 13. 1 ). The adhvaryu sprinkles clarified butter on 
the vessel called prasitraharana (that in which prasitra is 
carried ), keeps the prasitra in it and sprinkles ajya over it 
( does abhigharava ), takes it to the east of the ahavanlya by 
the space between the brahma and yajam&na on one hand and 
the ahavanlya on the other and then lays it down to the west

of the ahavanlya ( to the west of the pranlta waters, according 
to Baud. I. 17 ). The adhvaryu then sprinkles ajya in the 
i$ap3tra, he cuts off the first portion of ida from the southern 
half of the purodasa meant for Agni with ' from the southern 
half I out off (ida) seen by Manu, from whose foot ghee 
oozes, that is moved by Mitra and Varuna, that has a faoe 
in one direction only (in the south), without mixing it 
with others' rtM ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). From the eastern half 
of the same purodasa he cuts off a thin but long slice whioh 
is the portion of the yajamfina ( according to Baud. 1. 18 it is 
three or four angulas long ) and which is anointed ( or smeared ) 
with ajya and placed near the dhruva ( or to the east of the 
dhruva) in some vessel on the barhis. Then he outs off a 
part from the portion of the cake that is between its southern 
and eastern parts. In the same way ( i. e. repeating the 
verse ' seen by Manu' &c. ) he cuts off a portion as ida from 
the northern purodasa and other things offered ( such as- 
the boiled milk and ourds ). He then sprinkles ajya over the 
out portions and removes them towards the east on the vedi. 
He crosses to the south in front of the hotr, sits behind the hotr 
with his faoe to the east and anoints the front two joints of the 
fore-finger of the hotr with ajya from the sruva, firat the front 
joint and then the one next to it The hotr wipes with the palm 
of the hand turned towards his chest the uppermost joint of the 
finger on the upper lip and the next joint on his lower lip with 
' I partake of thee that art sacrificed by the lord of speech for 
food, for prana ' and ' I partake of thee that are offered by the 
lord of the mind for strength, for apana ' respectively ( Asv. I. 
7. 1-2 ; compare Sat. Br. 1. 8. 1. 14-15 ). He touches water. The 
adhvaryu turns from right to left, comes back to the place 
whence he went, sits dow n to the east of the hotr with his face

northwards and makes the adhvaryu out off from the ida itself 
a portion called avcLntare^H into the right hand in the following 
manner. The adhvaryu spreads drops of ajya on the right hand 
of the hotr with the sruva in which are poured the remnants of 
the ajya in the idSp&tra, then the adhvaryu takes a portion 
from the idapatra and drops it on to the right hand and the hotr 
himself cuts a seoond portion from the middle of the ida with the 
space between his thumb and the fore-finger; then the adhvaryu 
sprinkles over the ida in the right hand of the hotr ajya as 
above. ,m The hotr grasps the two portions with the thumb of 
his right hand, draws in the fingers of the right hand, but (keep* 
ing the thumb outside ) does not close them into a fist, takes 
into his right hand the ida placed in his left. He ( the hotr ) 
raises the ida on a level with his mouth or nose and invokes it. 

The idopahvSnam or ijopa— ( invocation of the ida ) is 
described at length by Asv. I. 7. 7. 2m By this invocation it is 
supposed that the deity Ida becomes favourable to the sacrificer. 
It is a nigada, but a large part of it is said inaudibly ( up to 
' vrsjir hvayatam ' ) and the rest loudly. The sentences run in 
pairs e. g. ' Ida has been invoked with the Heaven, with the 
great Aditya ; may ida together with Heaven and the great 
Aditya oall us near'. In the portion that is loudly uttered, there 
are three pauses, viz. after 'idopahuta,' after 'manusy ah' and after 
' devl devaputre'. The adhvaryu, the Sgnldhra and the saorifioer 
touch the idapatra with their hands "" and remain so till the

hotj: or only one. The two portions in the right hand of the hotr are 
called avSntareda*

derably from the one contained in Sat. Br. I. 8. 1. 19ff, Tai. Br. III. 5. 8. 

2385. According to com. on Sat. II. 3. p. 210 the brahml priest 
does not join in touching the idBpStra. This is also the praotice in 
modern times of those who follow Sat. Aooording to Baud. 1. 18 and 
Est. Ill, 4. 12 the brahml does join.

end of the invocation. When the invocation goes on inaudibly 

the yajamSna mutters (japati) '0 Ida! come (Ap. IV- 

10. 4)' and when it Is loudly uttered he mutters 'thou 
art cit &c.' ( Ap. IV. 10. 4, where they are oalled Manusyagavl 
mantras ) and utters loudly ' May you breathe into all beings, 
may all beings breathe on account of you &c.' and several 
other mantras ( Ap. IV. 10. 4 and 7 ). He looks at the hotr and 
thinks of Vayu in his mind ' VSyu ! Ida is thy mother * ( Ap. 
IV. 10. 5); when the words 'this yajamaua has been oalled* 
are uttered, he mutters ' May I, so invited, be endowed with 
cattle*. When the invocation of ida is finished, he repeats 
' may Indra put in ub vigour &c.\ When the words ' the divine 
adhvaryus ' are uttered, the adhvaryu mutters ' May I be 
endowed with cattle.' 

When the invocation of Ida is finished the adhvaryu passes 
round the ahavanlya towards its east and takes the prasitra to 
the brahma priest and hands it over to him. Asv. I. 13. 2 des- 
cribes in detail what thereon the brahma does. He looks at the 
prasitra when it is being brought with ' I look at thee with the 
eye of Mitra. ' He receives the prasitra in his joined hands 

with ' I acoept thee at the impulse of god Savitr, with the 

hands of Pusan. ' He lays down the vessel containing prasitra 
to the west of the ahavanlya inside the vedi on kusa grass, with 
its rod to the east, ' I place thee in the navel of the earth, in the 
lap of Aditi. ' He takes the prasitra with the thumb and the 
ring-finger and eats without masticating it with the teeth with 
'I eat thee with the mouth of Agni, with the mouth of Brhaspati.' 
Then he performs acamana and again drinks water with ' I 
sprinkle truth over thee; may the deities that dwell inside 
waters avert ( the evil in ) this. Do not injure my eye, my ear, 
my life.' He should touch his navel with ' I hold thee in the 
belly of Indra. ' Then he washes the vessel in whioh prasitra 
was oontained, fills it with water, pours- water thrice from it 
holding the vessel and the palm of the hand towards 
one's chest. 

The hotr eats the avantareda m ' after the brahma eats the 
prasitra with a mantra ' O Ida I favour this our portion &o. ' All

partake of the ids with a mantra ' thou art ids, thou art agree- 
able, thou art the bringer of happiness, place us in abundance 
of wealth and good progeny. I eat thee for the lustre of the face, 
for the fragrance of the mouth. * After eating ida they observe 
silence till they perform marjana. They perform marjana ,m 
inside the vedi near the prostata bunch with ' May mind resort 
to light. May all gods regale themselves here ' ( Tai. S. 
1.5.3.2). 

The adhvaryu divides the purodssa baked for Agni into four 
parts ( and no other purodaaa nor sannayya ) by piercing its 
surfaoe and keeps it on the 6ar/ws(kugas strewn on the vedi), the 
last part being made the biggest of all four. Vide Jai. IIL1.26-27. 
The yajamana recites a mantra ' bradhna pinvasva &o. ' ( Tai. 
Br. III. 7. 5) and directs the four parts of that purodasa separately 
as portions of the priests by saying ' this is for brahma, this for 
hotr, this for adhvaryu, this for agnldhra ' beginning in order 
from the south-east. The adhvaryu points out the portion of 
the yajamana ( vide p. 1065 above ). When that is done, the 
adhvaryu makes the biggest of the four parts which is meant 
for the agnldhra ' sadavatta ' (out sixfold). 888 ' The agnldhra eats 
his portion with ' thou art the portion of heaven, thou art the 
agnldhra of fire, thou art the samitra of fire, I eat thee with the 
mouth of fire, salutation to thee 1 Do not injure me. ' The 
adhvaryu brings the portions of brahma and yajamana 
where they are sitting in separate vessels with the veda bunch. 
The portions of the hotr and adhvaryu are brought by the 
adhvaryu in other vessels. The adhvaryu, hotr and brahma eat 
their portions respectively with ' thou art the portion of the 
aerial region,' 'thou art of the earth,' 'thou of heaven.' ,M * 

2387. Marjana means 'sprinkling water on the head after a mantra 
is reoited ' ( wri* H**rct ftrd% uTyuwQn • com. on Sat II. 3, p. 210). See 
however note 755 above and AsY 1. 8. 2. 

2388. According to Ap. III. 3.6-7 'stdavatta* is effected in either of 
two ways; first u pasta ran a in some vessel (on the hand of the agnldhra, 
according to com. ), then placing on it one part out of two in which the 
largest portion meant for agnldhra is cut, then abhigbSrana, then again 
upastarapa, placing the second part and the abhighErana ; or first 
upastarana twice, then the two part* of the largest portion and then two 
abbigbsranas. Sat. II. 3, p. 211 mentions only the first method. 

2389. It will hare been noticed from the preceding that the four 
priests have each a share in the cake for Agni and tbat they also share 
with the yajamfna the $48. The hotr has further the avKntaredi and 
the brahmi partakes of the prlsitra besides. 



Ob. XXX ] iiariapuryamasa-anvSharya 106d 

The conclusion of Jaimini ( III. 4. 48-50 ) is that these portions 
are not meant as the fee paid to the priests ( parikraya ), but 
the four parts are meant to be eaten by them. 

Plenty of rice is cooked on the daksina fire. This is called 
anvUharya. The adhvaryu sprinkles sjya over**" it ( i. e. 
performs abhighirana ) and takes it from the daksina fire to 
the north of it. He issues a direction to the yajamana * offer 
( the boiled rice ) to the priests that sit to the south ' and when 
the sacrificer says ' come to the south ' the priests do as 
requested ( i. e. come to the south ). The yajamana issues a 
direction to the four priests ' this boiled rice is yours, take it 
acoording to your shares \ The rice is divided into four partB 
and the priests accept their respective portions with ' I accept 

thee at the impulse of God Savitr with the hands of 

Pusan; may king Varuna take you. Who gave to whom? 

Desire ( Kama) has given to Kama Kama, this is thy 

fee. May Ahglrasa with upturned palm accept it' (the whole 
formula occurs in Ap. XIV. 11. 2). :M1 The priests come back to 
the north (and then brahmS comes to his usual seat). The 
adhvaryu keeps aside the remnants of the several offerings 
(suoh as the agnlsomlya cake or sannayya ) and of the boiled 
rice outside the vedi to its north. 

He throws into the aha van ly a the two blades that are 
now kindled at the fire and had been kept aside (vide 
p. 1040 above ). The adhvaryu says to the brahmS priest ' O 
brahman t we shall start or commence' (Tai. S. II. 6. 9. 1 ). 
The brahmS priest first mutters ' Brhaspati is Brahma, he sat in 
the seat of BrahmS; Brhaspati! you proteoted the sacrifice; 
protect the sacrifice and me' ( Asv. 1. 13. 6 ) and loudly gives 
permission ' yes, do start * ( 03m pratis^ha ). The adhvaryu 
directs the Sgnldhra 'O agnlfc, take the tamidh (that is left) and 
wipe Ihe paridhis and fire, each once '. The Sgnldhra takes the 
samidh and offers it into fire with the mantra ' O fire, this is

thy samidh; * w may you increase and be strengthened by it. 
May the lord of the sacrifice ( the yajamana ) increase and be 
strengthened ; svaha ' ( Sat. II. 4. p. 212 ). The yajamana says 
as usual ' agnaya idam ' and repeats ' fire, this is thy samidh 
&c. ' (Ap. III. 4. 6) and implores Agni to vanquish and 
destroy his enemies ( the lengthy formula is in Ap. IV. 11. 5 ). 
He ( the Sgnldhra ) without moving about wipes the paridhis 
as before with the tying cords of idhraa ( but without holding 
the sphya ), the middle one from south to north and the other 
two from west to east, and wipes the fire also from west to east 
with ' fire, that securest food &c. ' ( Ap. III. 4. 7 gives the 
whole ). He sprinkles water over the tying cords ( with which 
wiping was done ) and throws them into the ahavanlya with 
' do not injure our cattle, ( you ) who are Rudra, the lord of 
beings &c.' (Sat. II. 3. p. 213 )• The yajamana makes the 
tyaga ' this is for Budra, the lord of beings, who moves among 
rows (of Maruts)'. 

The yajam&na touohes water and mutters a mantra ( which 
is in Ap. IV. 11. 6 ' vedirbarhih &c. ). The yajamana also 
performs japa of the Saptahotr ,m formulas before the anuyijas 
are offered. The adhvaryu takes into the juhfi the ftjya from 
the upabhrt (leaving some in the latter), crosses over to 
the south with the juhu and sets about offering the three 
anuyajas. First there is the asravana ( 03sra3vaya ), then 
praty asravana (astu srauSsaO by Sgnldhra who always holds 
the sphya when saying this. Then the adhvaryu issues a 
direction to the hotr ' recite the yajyS for the devas.' When the 
hotr reoites the yajyft and utters vau3ssat the adhvaryu standing 
in one place offers the first ajya offering on the samidh ( offered 
for anuyajas as stated on 1069 above ) to its east, the 2nd and 
3rd to the west on the samidh itself ( but all three are offered to 

2392. It is interesting to see that according to Kit. III. 5. 2-3 the 
mantra 'this is thy samidh ' (Vaj. 8. II. 14) is recited by the hotr and if 
he be ignorant then by the yajainSna. This shows that even then priests 
ignorant of the work expected of them or at least ignorant of the 
formulas they had to recite for a yajamKna had sometimes to be 
engaged. The Sat. Br. I. 8.2.4 also refers to this tr*rf%fr»ta n fhrr 

8393. The saptabotr formulas are : trmrftfrrr I y wnifr u j : • «reg-

the east of the meeting point of the two Sgh&ras ). The third 
and last offering of fijya is begun on the west but carried east 
in a continuous stream so as to become mixed up with the first two. 
In eaoh case the yajamana repeats the formula of tyaga. The 
yajyas and ty&ga are given below in the note."'* The adhvaryu 
then comes back to the north, lays the two ladles ( sruc ) in 
their proper places and he and the yajamana mutter the two 
formulas (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 2 oalled vftjavatl). The adhvaryu 
takes up in his right hand with palm upwards the juhu and 
prastara ( prastara being placed over the palm and juhu over the 

prastara) witn 'vajasya grabhlt* (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 2) and 

holds down ( so as to bring it in contact with barhis ) with 
palm turned downwards in the left hand the upabhrt ladle (which 

is under the palm) with ' athasapatnan akah ' ( ibid ). He 

again takes up the juhu with 'udgrabham ca' (ibid ) and presses 
down the upabhrt with ' nigrabham ca.' At this time the juhu 
held in the right hand is far apart from the upabhrt held in the 
left. Then he moves with the right hand having palm turned 
upward towards the east on the vedi itself the juhu with 
' brahma deva avlvrdhan ' ( the gods inoreased holy prayer ) and 
with the left hand having palm downwards he leaves outside 
the vedi the upabhrt with ' atbasapatnan...vyasyatam' {ibid. 
'Indra and Agni burled away my enemies' &o.). Then he touches 
water, sprinkles water over the upabhrt, takes it up and anoints 
with the butter remaining in the juhu the three paridhis, 
the middle one with 'to thee for Vagus,' the southern one 
with ' to thee for Rudras ' and the northern one with ' to thee 
for Adityas.' The yajamana recites in eaoh oase ' this is for 
Vasus,' ' this is for Rudras,' ' this is for Adityaa ' followed in

each case with a prayer noted below."" After keeping the 
Juhu in some spot on the vedi other than where the prastara 
is, the adhvaryu, having mixed the prastara with the two 
vidbrtis ( vide above p. 1045 ) with ' may heaven and earth be 
of the same mind; may Mitra and Varuna help you with 
rain' he leaves the vidhrtis on the barbie and smears the 
prastara ( with the remnants of ajya ) in the three ladles (sruc), 
the points in juhu with ' licking the one that is smeared ' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 13. 1 ), middle portions In upabhrfc with ' viyantu 
vayah ' ( ibid ) and the roots in dhrnva with ' prajam yonim ' !,,, 
( ibid ). He does the anointing a seoond time ( with the same 
mantras ). He anoints a third time in the reverse order viz. the 
roots first In dhruva, the middle portions in upabbrt and the 
tops last in juhu ( the mantras being the same for each ladle ). 
The yajamana repeats, while the prastara is being anointed, 
a mantra 'may kusa be anointed with ghee ' (Ap. IV. 12. 3). 
Taking out a blade from the prastara so anointed with ' to thee 
for long life ', he plaoes it in a known place ( for use later on ). 
When the blade is taken away from the prastara the yajamana 
reoites a mantra ( apipred yajfio...yajamanam visantu ). 

The adhvaryu takes the prastara ( and also the iakha i. e. 
twig used at the time of milking cows when sann&yya is to be 
offered ), introduces the prastara ( together with the twig ) at the 
corner In the north where the middle and northern paridbis 
meet and says ' a3sravaya." When the agnldhra responds with 
' astu srau3saV he issues a direction to the hotr ' the divine 
hotrs are desired ( or requested); you being human and directed 
to utter the words of success recite hymns for the god called 
suktavaka.' The hotr begins the recitation of suktavaka m7

pronounce the good words ( viz. ' fire has aocepted this havis

declarer of good words.' Then numerous words follow that 
state the various attributes of heaven and earth. Then it is 
declared that Agni and other deities ( named ) have accepted 
the offering and made it flourish. Then the sacrificer is named 
and it is said that he hopes for various blessings such as long 
life, worthy sons. The whole is concluded with ' we men belong 
to Agni. May we have ( the fruits of ) sacrifice and wealth. 
May both heaven and earth save us from sin ( or evil ). May 
the most desirable thing come here. Here is adoration to 
the gods.' After the suktavaka the adhvaryu throws upon

drops of Maruts ; go to heaven and send tbence rain to us ' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 13. 1 )."»» Jaimini makes it clear ( VI. 4. 43-47 ) 
that sakha is not a subordinate complement of the prastara but 
the real meaning of the text ' he throws the prastara with the 
sakha ' is to indicate the time when the sakha is to be thrown 
into fire. Jaimini ( IV. 2. 10-13 ) states that the throwing of 
the sakha into fire is pratipattikarma ( i. e. that is the final 
disposal of the sakhS ). When throwing the prastara he does 
not bend his hand but holds it rather straight and hanging 
downwards and the tips of the prastara are not put beyond 
the fire nor are they turned upwards, nor are the tips allowed 
to be first scorched. He raises it up, brings it slowly down 
and rolls it on the hearth of the ahavanlya ( making the 
upper portion come down and vice versa ). The adhvaryu, when 
the hotr says ' this sacrificer seeks ( hopes for ) blessings ' 
directs the agnldhra to oonsign the prastara to fire. The 
agnldhra thrice raises with his joined hands the prastara 
into the ahavanlya fire. The sacrificer makes the tyaga to the 
several deities mentioned in the suktavaka ( agnaya idam, 
somfiyedam &o.) and adds (Tai. S. 1. 6. 4. 1 ) ' may I win victory 
following the victory of Agni ' ( then of Soma and so on for 
the other deities )." 00 When the hotr mentions the name of the 
sacrificer the latter recites 'these blessings have come here ' 
( Tai. 8. L 6. 4. 2 and &p. IV. 12. 5 ). The adhvaryu directs 
the agnldhra to throw into fire on the prastara the blade of 
kusa taken from the prastara and kept aside ( as described 
above p. 1072 ) and the agnldhra " 01 does so with ' Good speed 
to the tanus, svaha*. The yajamfina mutters 'this for the

was raised over the earth. With it that has a thousand shoots we 
worry our enemy etc.' (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 and ip. IV. 12. 8). The 
adhvaryu points out thrioe with his forefinger the blade thrown 
into fire with 'this, this' and touches his nose and eyes with 
' Agnil thou art the protector of life, protect my life, thou art 
the protector of eyes ' ( Tai. 8. 1. 1. 13. 2 ). Then the adhvaryu 
touches the earth inside the vedi with 'thou art stable'( ibid ).

The agnldhra then addresses the adhvaryu ' talk with me '. 
The adhvaryu asks ' has ( the prastara ) been consigned to 
flames ' ? The agnldhra replies ' it has gone to the fire '. Than 
after asravana and pratyasr&vana the adhvaryu touching the 
middle enclosing stick ( paridbi ) issues a direction to the hotr 
' Good speed to the divine hotrs ( here the paridhis ) and bliss 
to human hotrs. Recite for iam-yoh'. 3t0 * Then the hotr recites 
the verse ' we long for that sam-ydh, for ( the ) path to sacrifice 
and to the lord of sacrifice. May divine bliss be ours 1 May 
there be bliss for human beings. May the means ( of bliss ) 
ascend upwards 1 All health to the two-footed and the four- 
footed that are ours * ( i. e. to men and cattle ). M0 * When the 
Sarhyuvaka is repeated the yajamana mutters ' may I attain 
stability by yajna, sarhyoh (health and wealth) by the worship 
of Visnu* ( Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 3 ). The adhvaryu then throws into 
the fire the middle paridhi with 'O God Agni, that paridhi 
which you laid down svfiha' (Tai. S. 1. 1. 13. 2). 

The adhvaryu then pushes on to the burning coals of the 
ahavanlya the other two paridhis together ( the southern and 
northern ones ) with ' the food of sacrifice has come together.' 
He thrusts the tip of the northern paridbi underneath the middle 
one in the burning coals and keeps the tip of the southern over 
the middle one. When the paridhis are being thrown on the 
fire the yajamana mutters ' I loosen thy girdle &o." ( Tai. S. 
I. 6. 4. 3 ). After the paridhis aTe thrown the adhvaryu invokes 
them 'may you spread ( i. e. prolong the life of ) the sacrificer*. 

The adhvaryu then lays on the bowl of the juhu the 
upabhrt and lets flow from the two ladles the remnants of 
butter into fire with ' O Visve Devas 1 You have for your share 
the remnants ( samsrava ) of 8jya,...svah5 ' (Tai. 8. 1. 1. 13. 2). M0 *

The yajamana makes the tyaga with ' this is for Vagus, Rudras 
Adityas who are sharers in the sarhsrfiva ( remnants of ajya ),' 
then utters a benediotory formula invoking blessings ( vide 
Ap. IV. 12. 10 and Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 4 ) and touches the veda bunch 
lying inside the vedi. 

The priests partake of the remnants of fijya and wash the 
ajya sticking to the ladles.* 401 

The adhvaryu takes up the juhu and upabhrt, the hotr takes 
the veda bunch and the Sgnldhra takes the pot of fijya (ajya- 
sthall) together with the sruva. Being about to perform the 
patnlsarhyfijas ,40 ' the adhvaryu passes to the south of the 
garhapatya fire ( from its east side ) and the other two priests 
( hotr and Sgnldhra ) pass to its north. The adhvaryu places 
the two ladles on the sphya with ' I place you in the abode of 
Agni whose house is indestruotible ; may you who are happy 
place me in happiness for the sake of happiness; may you who 
are the foremost (or leaders) protect me. when I am in front' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 13. 2-3 ). They sit to the west of the garhapatya 
and set about the offerings of Patnlsamy&jas with the two ladles 
in the dhvfina tone. They three sit to the west of the garha- 
patya with knees raised up, the adhvaryu being seated to the 
south, the Sgnldhra to the north and the hotr between the two. 
The hotr hands over the veda bunch to the adhvaryu who takes 
it with ' 1 have stood up following the immortals with long 
life &c.' ( Tai. S. I. 2. 8. 1 ), stands up and sits down to the 
west of the garhapatya. When the wife ( of the sacrifice* ) 
holds the veda bunch and touohes the adhvaryu with a blade of 
darbha, the adhvaryu takes into the juhu four ladlings of fijya 
with sruva ( from the pot of ajya ). Then the procedure for 
each of the four offerings resembles the prayaja offerings, viz. 

2405. The ladles are tbe sruva, the juhtl and upabhrt and not the 
dhruvB ( coin, on Sat. II. 4. p. 220).

the adhvaryu issues a direction to the hotr to recite sn anu- 
vakya ( invitatory prayer ) for Soma ( then for Tvast? and so 
on ), tben the hotr reoites the anuvakya, then there is asruta 
and pratyasruta, followed by adhvaryu directing the hotr to 
recite the ySjya for Soma (orTva?tr or others as the case may 
be), and when the hotr utters ' vai3?at* the adhvaryu pours 
the ajya oblation from the juhu into the garhapatya ( in this 
rite ). The offering to Soma is made in the northern part of the 
garhapatya, that to Tvastr in the southern part and for the rest 
between these two. The offering to the wives of the gods may 
be made in an enclosed space ( i. e. by placing a screen to the 
east of the garhapatya ) so as to shut the garhapatya from view 
on the eastern side.' 407 Additional offerings were allowed to 
be made to Raka, Sinlvall and Kuhu by those who desired sons, 
cattle or prosperity respectively either before or after the 
offering to the wives of the gods. The procedure is briefly 
indicated in the note below." 08 

The yajamana makes a tyaga ( of the offering ) with ' this 
for Soma ' ( or for Tvastr and so on ) and adds a separate for- 
mula in each case invoking separate blessings of vigour, cattle, 
progeny and stability (vide Ap. IV. 13. 1 and Tai. S. 1. 6. 4. 3-4).

in the Sat. Br. I. 9. 2. 12 to be " for, up to the time of the Samisfnyujus 
the deities continue waiting, thinking 'this be must offer to us'; he 
thereby conceals this offering from tbem ; and accordingly Yajfia-

oblation of ftjya with' 40 ' 'may the wife unite with her husband... 
svfthft ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 quoted on p. 556 n. 1291 ). The 
sacrificer's wife touches the adhvaryu ( with a blade of darbha) 
when he makes the last offering. The yajamfina makes the 
tyftga ' this is for the undeoaying Great Soul, the light 
in Heaven. ' 

The adhvaryu then smears the two front joints of the hotr's 
finger as before, first the hind joint and then the front joint. 
He breathes over it and touches water. The adhvaryu drops 
into the palm of the right hand of the hotr four drops of ftjya as 
ids , *'° and six in that of the Sgnldhra. The hotr inaudibly 
invokes both ( viz. his own ids and ftgnldhra's, the hand of the 
latter being held underneath the former's ) in the same words 
as before (vide Appendix under note 2384). When the words 'this 
yajamfina has been summoned ' are uttered, the wife mutters 
' being summoned may I surpass in the possession u " of cattle,' 
and the adhvaryu also performs japa as above. When the 
ids is being invoked the adhvaryu, the Sgnldhra and the 
wife ( with a darbha blade ) touch the hotr. The yajamSna 
invokes ftjya ids with ' may ids cover us with gbrta &o.' ( Ap. 
IV. 13. 4 ). At the end of the invocation of ids the hotr eats 
the ids ( drops of ftjya ) and the Sgnldhra eats his with ' father 
Heaven has been invoked, may tbe fire summon me from Sgnl- 
dhra for my life, lustre &c* ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 ). He silently 
performs mfirjana after partaking of ids. The patnlsamyajas 
end with the invocation of ids or they may be finished after 
reciting SarhyuvSka (Sat. II. 5, p. 225; Asv. I. 10.9; Est. 
III. 7. 13 ). 

Tbe adhvaryu sitting to the west of tbe daksioa fire places 
on it the chips cut from the idbma ( idhma-pravrasoana, vide 
above p. 1014 ) and offers two oblations called phallkarana 
and pist&lepa. *"* Having thrown into the ftjya ladled into

modification viz. ^rrf atf irsrwprt f or ^nfrtW *nWT»r* and so in the 2nd 
ids the wife performs japa ; while ( as the com. of Sat. notes ) the

the juhO four times with the sruva the smallest grains ( that 
were produced when rice grains were husked and pounded for 
making purodfttas), the adhvaryu offers them into the daksina 
fire with ' O fire, that hast unhurt life and not cool body, guard 
me against the sky (lightning) ... make our food free from 
poison ... svaba ' ( Tal. S. 1. 1. 13. 3 ). When this homa is made 
the yajamSna rubs (wipes) his mouth with 'sv&b& to thee, that 
art SarasvatI Yasobhaglna ' ( who loves laudation) and makes 
the tyfiga with 'this is for Agni who has long life and not cool 
body' and wipes his face with 'svaba to thee, that art SarasvatI 
Vesabhaglna' wi (who loves residing together, Ap. III. 10. 2). 
The adhvaryu takes again four ladlings of ajya with the sruva 
into the juhu and pours therein the remnants of ground grains 
which still stick to the several utensils and offers them into the 
daksina fire with ' whatever stuck to the mortar, pestle and the 
winnowing basket... ! Svaha*(Tai. Br. IIL 7. 6 and Ap. III. 
10. 1 ). The yajamana says 'this is for the All-Gods'. 

The hotr hands over the veda bunch to the sacrificer's wife 
and makes her repeat aloud 'thou art veda.. .may I secure pro- 
geny. To thee for Kama' (As v. I. 11. 1) and the sacrificer 
recites, when the veda bunch is being given to the wife ' thou art 

Veda may I secure gifts' ( Tai. S. 1. 6. 6. 4 ) and when the 

veda is placed on her lap by the wife '"* she repeats ' may veda 
give &o.' ( Tai. S. 1. 6. 6. 4 ). The wife thrusts it with ' drive out 
the enemy, the hater' ( Ap. III. 10. 4 ). The wife touches her 
navel with the top of the veda bunch if she desires progeny. 

The hotr unties the yoktra (the girdle) of the wife with ' I 
release thee from the fetter of Varuna &o.' (Rg. X. 85. 24). M " 
The wife lays aside the yoktra and the adhvaryu makes her 
reoite 'here do I unloosen the fetters of Varuna &c.' (Tai. S. L 1. 
10. 2). The hotr winds round the yoktra twofold, placeB it to 
the west of the garhapatya fire with its loop and end to the east,

and lays down a purnapatra "" ( a vessel filled with water) to 
the eatt of the blades but touching them. The hotr touches 
that vessel and makes tbe wife who touches it repeat a mantra 
'thou art full &c* (Tai S. I. 6. 5. 1 ). The ho'r sprinkles water 
from the purnapatra in all directions and makes the wife, who 
also sprinkles water from it in all directions, repeat ' Let the 
god b and the priests purify (or wipe) in the eastern direction 
&o.'(Tai.S. I. 6. 5. 1-2, quoted in As v. I. 11. 7). The hotr 
places into the joined hands of the saorificer's wife with the 
palm upwards the yoktra, and places his left hand with palm 
turned upwards on the wife's folded hands (but in modern 
practice the hotr does not hold bis hand over the wife's ) and 
pours down tbe water from the purnapatra on the bands ( bis 
and the wife's) and makes her repeat ' May I not throw away 
progeny &o.' (Asv. I. 11. 8). The hotr holds by his right hand 
the tops of the blades of the veda bunch ( the binding cord of 
which has already been unloosened), proceeds from tbe garha- 
patya to the ahavanlya, repeats Rg. X. 53. 6 ( tantum tanvan &c.) 
and without shaking them, strews continuously some of them 
from the gSrhapatya to the ahavanlya. The rest of the blades 
the hotr lays down and, standing to the north-east of the 
ahavanlya, takes ajya from the pot of ajya ( ajyasthall ) in the 
sruva and offers with svaha at the end of the mantras oblations 
of ajya, which are called ' sarvapr&y ascitta ' (expiation for all 
lapses ). The mantras are given below.' 417 Having made the 
oblations the hotr pays homage with the ' sarhsthajapa (lit. the

mutters ' May I be united with long life, progeny &o.' ( Tai. S. I. 
1. 10. 2 ). After pouring the water she wipes her faoe with her 
wet right hand and goes out as she desires.' 419 When the hotr 
strews the blades of the veda, the saorifioer repeats ' through you 
they knew the vedi &o.' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 ). 

The adhvaryu comes back by the way he went, repeats 
' may the dhruva be strengthened &c.' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 5. 1 ) and 
offers two ahutis of ajya to SarasvatI with the juhu into the 
ahavanlya with 'to thee, who are SarasvatI, called Yasobhaglna, 
svaha ' and with ' to thee SarasvatI called Vesabhaglna, . svana.' 
The yajamana makes the tyaga in similar words. The adhvaryu 
again takes ajya in the juhu and offers an ahuti to Indra with 
' Indropanasya kehamanaso vesan kuru sumanasab sajafcan ' 
( Sat. II. 5. p. 230, Ap. III. 10. 2 ) ™° and the yajamana says 
' this is for Indra &c.' The adhvaryu offers an oblation of ajya 
with sruva on the purnamasa isti with ' we offer worship to pur- 
namasa the foremost &c. svaha* (Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 quoted by 
Sat. II. 5 p. 230 ) and a similar oblation on darsesfi with 
4 Am&vasya is fortunate and full of happiness &o. svaha.' The 
yajamana makes tyaga. These are called parvayxihoma and 
according to some they are optionally performed before the 
offering to Svistakrt. Jaimini ( IX. 2. 51-56 ) establishes that 
these two homas are not performed in other isfis that are the 
modifications ( vikrti ) of darsapurnamasa and in IX. 2. 57-58 
establishes that both are not performed on purnamSses^i and 
darsesti, but the first homa ( in which there is an oblation to 
purnamasa ) is alone performed on purnamasestf and the other 
on darsesti. The adhvaryu takes ajya six times with the mantra 
' apyayatam dhruva &o.' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 5. 1 ) and offers six homas

' to Nftristfias Agni and Vayu,' ' to Naristhas Indra and Vayu 
(twice),' 'to Naristhas Soma and Maruts,' 'to Naristfia 
Brahman,' ' tp Niria^ha Paramatman.' 

The adhvaryu recites ' apyayatam dhruva' (Tai. S. I. 6. 5.1), 
takes ajya thirty-eight times and offers with the juhtt oblations 
called sarvapr8yascittas to thirty-eight deities in the ahavanlya 
with a mantra for each, WM and there is an appropriate tyaga 
in each caBe. 

The adhvaryu repeats the mantra ' apyayatam &c* ( Tai. 
S. I. 6. 5. 1 ), increases the dhruva ( with ajya ), stands erect 
inside the vedi and offers with the dhruva three homaB called 
Bamistaycuiis HU in the ahavanlya with ' ye path-finding gods 1 
after finding the path, return by it. Lord of the mind I 
place this our sacrifice among the gods, in speech, in the wind ' 
( Tai. S. 1. 1. 13. 3 ). When the word svaha is repeated the 
second time he throws the barhis into the fire. The yajamana 
says ' this is for the path-finding gods, for Yajfia — for Para- 
matman ' and utters the invocation ' agne adabdhayo * ( Tai. S. 
1.1.13.3,) and after the barhis is thrown the verse ' divah 
khIlo'(Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The yajaraBna then eats his own 
share of the sacrificial food with ' let the lord of sacrifice be 
united with prayer &o.' ( Tai. 8. 1. 3. 8. 1 ). 

But if it is the sannayya, he takes in the boiled milk with 
'May this havis, a giver of progeny, be for my welfare &o.' 
( Tai. Br. II. 6. 3 ) and curds with ' dadhikravno * ( Hg. IV. 39. 6 ). 
Ap. IV. 14. 2 notes that a yajamana who is not a brahmana 
should not eat sannayya The adhvaryu strews the vedi with

( III. 11-12 ) contains most of them, but in a different order. 

2423. ' Samisfayajus ' would literally mean 'a Yajus formula indi- 
cative of the completion of the sacrifice or of sacrificing together for 
many deities \ It now means ' an oblation '. The mantra is ^«rr irrB;-

Tai. 8. 1. 1. 13. 3. There is a difference of view about the Saraisfayajus. 
Aocording to Ap. III. 13. 2 (and com. ), Band. I. 21, Kit. III. 8. 4 the 
oblation is only one (made at the end of the whole mantra), though 
the word svKhS ocours thrioe (twice in the mantra itself and onoe 
repeated at the end of the mantra ). Aooording to Sat. II. 6 pp. 234-285 
the oblations are three. Vide V«j. 8. II. 21 for the mantra (slightly 
different ) and-Sat. Br. 1. 9. 2. 26-28 for its explanation.

the darbhas spread on the seat of the hofcr with ' strew over the 
vedi &c* ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 5 ). He oarries the pranlta waters 
from the eastern side with 'to you for prosperity' and pours 
them down inside the vedi with 'may he who joined you toge- 
ther separate you'. The adhvaryu pours on those pranlta 
waters a continuous stream of water for the yajamana who 
holds it in his joined, hands and mutters 'thou art true, be true 

to me do not perish for me' ( sadasi ksestfi&h ' Tai. S. I. 

6.5.1), throws up water in different directions with 'may 
gods and priests cleanse with water in the east &c. ' 
( Asv. I. 11. 6-7), pours the rest inside the vedi with 'I dis- 
charge you to the ocean, that is your origin' ( Ap. IV. 14. 4) 
and wipes bis face with his wet right hand with ' SarasvatI ! 
that honey which you have in waters &c. ' ( Tai. Br. II. 5. 8 
quoted in Ap. IV. 14.4). 

The adhvaryu then takes up the upavesa and conceals it 
inside the dust of the utkara ( vide Ap. III. 13. 6 ) and if it is 
desired to practise magic against one's enemy, then he throws the 
upavesa on the utkara after taking the enemy's name ( Ap. III. 
14. 1, Sat. II. 6. p. 237 ). Vide Tai. Br. III. 3. 11 for the upavesa 
and the mantras. The adhvaryu takes leave of the Yajfia with 
' Let him who yokes you discharge you ' ( Tai. S. I. 5. 10. 3 
quoted in Sat. IL 6. p. 237 ) and passes his eye over the whole 
sacrificial ground.* 48 * Then he discharges the kapalas with ' the 
kapalas that were in the cauldron ' ( Tai. S. I. 5. 10. 3-4 quoted 
in Sat. II. 6. p. 237 ), counts them and keeps them aside. Then 
the adhvaryu goes out. The brahma also places a fuel- stick on 
fire with ' the fire has been worshipped &o.' ( Ap. III. 13. 1 
and Sat. IL 8. p. 261 ) and then leaves by the way he came. 

The yajamSna gets up from his seat and takes what are 
called ' the strides of Visnu * ( visnukrama ). Uii These are four 
taken from the south corner ( sroni ) on the south side of the 
vedi. He starts towards the east putting the right foot always 
first, never allows the left foot to come in front, does not go 
beyond the Shavanlya place and each succeeding step covers 

2424. According to com. on Sat. casting the eye over the vihSra 
constitutes the discharge ( vimoka ) of the yajfia. 

2425. This act is called Visnu-krama because the four mantras 
repeated in it all begin with ' vienoh kramosi ' and because the 
yajamKna aotually takes four steps in it. ftstyvm »rrn <r%f*mrftftTgjTt

more ground than each preceding one. He first recites 
four mantras ' thou art the stride of Visnu &o. ' ( Tai. 
S. I. 6. 5. 2 ) when taking the strides. Then he mutters a long 
prayer to the Sun ' O Light of Mitra rising to-day &c.' ( Tai. 
Br. III. 7. 6 and Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 1, quoted in Ap. IV. 15. 1 and I. 
16. 1 ). He contemplates the destruction of his enemy with the 
words ' Here do I exclude from a share my enemy the evil-doer 
&o." He revolves round himself from left to right with ' I turn 
the turning of Indra' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 2 ) and goes round the 
ahavanlya with ' Let me have auspioious riches and may evil 
riches remain away from me ' ( Ap. IV. 15.4). He bends over the 
ahavanlya with ' thou art light ' (Tai. S. 1. 1. 10. 3), pays homage 
to it with ' May I be united with my children and may my 
ohildren be united with me &c.' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 2, Ap. IV. 
15. 4). He puts the fire into flames ' O fire, being kindled, 
shine for me &o.' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 2, Ap. IV. 16. 5 ). He 
prays to the ahavanlya with ' The sacrifice is endowed with 
riches, may I be endowed with riches &o.' ( Tai. S. 1. 6. 6. 2, Ap. 
IV. 15. 5. ). He prays to the daksina fire ' fire, oook food 
pleasantly eaten for our progeny ' ( Ap. IV. 16. 5 ). He prays 
to the garhapatya fire with the two verses to Agni Pavamana 
(Bg. IX 66. 19-20, Tai. S. 1. 6. 6. 2), and with * O Agni Grhapatil 
I am a good house-holder &c.' (Tai. S. 1. 6. 6. 3). If he has no son 
he prays 1 "* 'I pray for that blessing full of spiritual lustre for 
my son ( to be ) ' and if he has a son he prays ' I pray for my 
son so and so that blessing &c.' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 3 ). He sits 
between the two fires inside the vedi with ' to thee (unborn 
or born son as the case may be) who art light &o.' (Ap. IV. 
16. 6 ). He places on his lap the blades of the veda ( that had 
been unloosened ) and sitting inside the vedi mutters the Ati- 
moksa mantras ' May Agni guard me against those gods that 
strike the sacrifice &o. ' ( Tai. S. III. 5. 4. 1-2 indicated in Ap. 
IV. 14. 10 ). 

He then comes to his seat, looks at the whole sacrifice 
with ' who yokes thee? Let him free thee* ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 3 )• 
He then discharges himself from vrata with 'O fire, lord of 
vratas, I observed vrata &o.' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 3, Tai. A. IV. 41,

Vaj. S. II. 28 ). He then mutters the mantra which speaks of 
the re-performanoe of yajna ' Yajfia hath become, it has come 

into being let him make us overlords, may we be lords of 

wealth ' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6, 4 ). He then gets up and mutters a 
text after going out with his face to the east ' O fire, the sacri- 
fice is endowed with cows May this sacrifice be rich in 

food in halls' ( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 4 ) and a further prayer ( given 

in Ap. IV. 16. 15 ). MW Then after saying ' thou art rain a 

bow to you ' he touohes water. Then the sacrificer issues a 
direction 'the brahmanas have to be satiated' (with dinner &c). 

Lastly the yajam&na offers final prayers by repeating 
Eg. 1. 189. 1, VII. 4. 1, VII. 10. 3, I. 189. 3, 1. 189. 2, III. 6. 1 
and winds up with ' salutation to thee once, twice, thrice, four 
times, five times, ten times, a hundred times. May there be 
salutation to thee up to a thousand times. Do not injure, may 
we be free from debts in this world, in the next world, in the 
third world; may we, free from debts, dwell in all the paths, 
those that are Devayana (lead to the gods) and those that lead 
to the pitrs.' According to Tai. S. II. 5. 3. 1 and Ap. III. 15. 1-5 
there is an additional purodasa offered to Indra Vaimrdha. 
Jai. ( IV. 3. 32-35 ) declares that this purodasa is offered only 
on the Full Moon day sacrifice and not in the New Moon sacri" 
fice. Vide Jai. X. 8. 17-19 for seventeen samidhenl verses in 
the Vaimrdha istf. 

There are differences in the procedure of darses^i as com- 
pared with that of the purnamasestf which have been noted in 
the above at the respective places. There are several modi- 
fications of the darsapurnamasa such as the Daksayana yajna, 
the Vaimrdha, Sakamprastblya, which are omitted here for 
want of space. Jaimini (II. 3. 5-11 ) establishes that the Dak. 
sayana, Sftkamprasthlya and Samkrama yajiias are modifica- 
tions of darsapurnamasa.

It is so called because balls of rice are offered to the pitrs" 58

is an independent rite and not a mere subordinate part of the 
darsa sacrifice. On the other hand several writers held that 
it was a subordinate part ( anga) of darsa e. g. Est. IV. 1, 30 
appears to be of that opinion and the paddhati on it notes that 
all bhasyakaras like Karka stick to that opinion. 8 *'* The 
pindapikryaj3a is briefly described below. For details, vide 
Sat.' Br. II. 4. 2, Tai. Br. I. 3. 10, II. 6. 16, Asv. II. 6-7, 
fi.p. I. 7-10, Kat. IV. 1. 1-30, Sat. II. 7, Baud. III. 10-11. It is 
performed on amavasya day when the moon oannot be seen and 
its distance from the sun is the least, in the last third part of 
the day or when only the rays of the sun are visible on the tops 
of trees. mD The caru ( boiled rice ) is cooked on the daksinfigni 
and the oblation is offered in the same. In this and other ways 
a contrast is brought out between rites for gods and for Manes. 
He kindles a blade on the daksina fire and carries it to 
the south-east of that fire with the mantra * ye rupani &c.' ( Vaj. 
S. II. 30 ). uU All actions are to be done facing the south-east 
unless otherwise specified. The darbha grass (to be employed in 
this rite) is severed at one stroke and is brought with or without 
its roots ( Ap. 1. 7. 3-4 ). Strewing round the daksinagni darbha 
grass (paristarayia) with their ends turned to the south in the case 
of those that are plaoed to the north or south he spreads 
darbhas to the north. He places to the north-east or to the 
north-west of the daksinagni singly the yajfiapatras required in 
this rite on darbha grass viz. carusthall, surpa, sphya, mortar 
and pestle, sruva, dhruva, antelope-skin, fuel-sticks cut off at 
one stroke, meksana, kamandalu, and whatever else may be 
necessary. The adhvaryu going to the south of the sakata ( the 
wooden frame on whioh the paddy is stored and which is to the 
west of the fire ) fills the carusthall (vessel for cooking rice) 
that is placed on the surpa with paddy to the brim and removes 
the grains ( that rise above the brim ) on to the surpa ( whioh 
overflowing grains are returned to the sakata ). The mortar is 
then plaoed on the blaok antelope-skin and the wife with her 
face to the south-east beats with the pestle the paddy grains

taken out in the oarusthfill and removes the husks by means of 
the winnowing basket. Without trying to separate the husked 
grains from the unhusked ones the grains are washed onoe and 
cooked on the daksina fire ( in such a way that the grains of 
rice are not entirely soft ). He Bhould draw with the sphya a 
line between the gSrhapatya and daksina fires or to the south- 
east of the latter with the words ' the asuras and evil-spirits that 
oooupy the vedi are scattered away * ( Vsj. S. II. 29 quoted in 
Sat. II. 7. p. 249 and Ip. L 7. 13 ). He should then sprinkle 
that line ( as the vedi for this rite ) with water, spread round 
it the darbha grass ( cut off with one stroke ), take clarified 
butter in the dhruva spoon, place it to the south of the 
daksin&gni, sprinkle on the mess of cooked rice clarified 
butter from the dhruva. He places to the south of the 
daksinagni, collyrium, unguents, a mat and a pillow. 
Wearing the sacred thread in the pr&olnavlta form ( accord- 
ing to Ap. I. 8. 3 and Sat. II. 7. p. 248 the adhvaryu wears 
it in the upavlta form) he offers on the fire the idhma 
( i e. fifteen fuel-sfcioks ), takes a portion of the boiled rice 
with the mekqava, pours olarified butter over it, cuts off 
two portions of the rice on it, again sprinkles olarified butter 
over Msa the portions and the rice from which they are taken, 
offers into the daksina fire one ahuti ( oblation ) with the words 
' Somaya pitrmate svadha namah ', then again sprinkles clari- 
fied butter on the portion cut off and offers it with the words 
' Agnaye kavyavahanaya svadha namah '. He MM then throws 
the meksana on to the fire. Then on the line made with the sphya 
he sprinkles water thrice UH with the mantras 'Sundhantam 
pitarah, sundhantam pitamahah, sundhantam prapifcamahah ' 
( may the fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand-fathers wash 
themselves pure ). He offers three balls of rice on that line one 
after another with the hand turned sideways ( i. e. the pinda is 
let off on the line from the part of the palm between the thumb 

2432. In the case of this offering there is arrwr, then fgx^IT, 
wfiftntT ( and Jjnrfifcrrcor) as in the case of oblations to gods. 

2433. Ap. I. 8. 3-4 and Sat. II. 7. p. 248 (following Tai. Br.

and the index finger ) with appropriate mantras, the first to the 
father with the words ' this is for you father, 8 * 35 N. N. and 
those who come after yon ', to the grand-father with the words 
' this is for you grand-father &o.', to the great-grandfather with 
similar words. The pinda ( ball of rioe ) for the great-grand- 
father is the biggest of the three, that for the grand-father 
being larger than that for the father. There was a difference 
of view among the teachers as to the prooedure when any of 
the three ancestors was living, GSnagari holding that pindas 
were offered only to the deceased ancestors and he who was 
living was only honoured, while Taulvali said that pindas 
were to be offered to three ancestors whether living or dead and 
Gautama stating that if any ancestor out of the first three above 
the sacrificer was alive, three pindas were to be offered and an 
ancestor beyond the great-grand-father may then be included. 
.5.8V. (II. 6. 20-23) refutes all these views by saying that no pinda 
oan be offered to any ancestor beyond the great-grand-father 
and none to those who are alive nor to any ancestor between 
whom and a preoeding anoestor a living ancestor intervenes* 
but that the pindas meant for ancestors that are alive may be 
thrown into fire ( with sv&ha at the end and not svadha ). 
According to Ap. I. 9. 8 and Sat. p. 252 if the householder's 
father be living he should not offer pindas but should stop 
after he performs the homa. If he has 24M two fathers or grand- 
fathers or great- grand-fathers ( owing to adoption or niyoga ) he 
should take two names with referenoe to the pinda offered to 
that ancestor. When the pindas are placed on the line referred 
to above he invokes the pindas with a formula ' Here you may 
regale yourselves, O pitrs and may you partake according to 
your shares' (Vaj,S.II.31). MW Then he turns round and faces the 
north, sits down holding his breath till he feels exhausted, then 
again turns round and faces the pindas and utters the invocation

' the pitrs have regaled themselves and have partaken according to 
their shares' ( Vaj. S. II. 31). He smells the boiled rice. 
Then he again offers water ( ninayana ) with the words ' San* 
dhantam &o. ', ( vide above p. 1087 ) on the line made with the 
gphya, he puts on the three pindas one after another the 
unguents and collyrium respectively with the words ' asau 
abhyanksva ' ( you by name so and so father &o. apply the 
unguents ) and ' asau ahksva ' ( you so and so father, &c. put 
the collyrium in the eye ). He should then place as garment 
on each of the pindas the hem of a garment ( dasa ) or woolen 
tuft or a hair from his own body ( the part above navel ) if he 
is beyond fifty years of age with the words ' O pitrs, this is the 
garment for you, may you not come in contact with any other 
( garment ) than this' ( Asv. II. 7. 6 ). Then he should wait 
upon the pitrs with salutation and mutter the mantra ' saluta- 
tion to you, Pitrs, for (securing) food, salutation to you, 
Pitrs, for strength ' &o. tm and also the three verses ' manonva- 
huvamahe' ( $g. X. 57. 3-5 )." ! » He should then make the 
pitrs start forward on a stream of water ( i. e. by pouring 
water on the pindas ) with the mantra 'O well-disposed pitrs! 
May you depart away by the ancient and awe-inspiring paths, 
after bestowing on us wealth and welfare. May you send 
down to us prosperity inoluding all manly sons ' ( vide Tai. 
S. I. 8. 5. 2 for first half ). He should walk a little towards the 
daksinagni with the verse Rg. IV. 10. 1 and then towards the 
garhapatya with the mantra ' May the garhapatya fire deliver 
me from whatever Bin I may have committed against Heaven 
and Earth, or parents and may the same fire make me sinless ' 
( Tat S. I. 8. 5. 3 ). He should take hold of the middle pinda 
with the words ' O pitrs I bestow'on me a valiant ( son ) ' and 
should make his wife eat that ball of rice with the mantra £ "°

' O pitrs 1 may you deposit an embryo that will be a young boy 
wearing a lotus wreath, so that he may be unhurt ' ( compare 
Vaj. S. II. 33 ). The other two pindus may be thrown into 
water or fire or a person who has recently lost all appetite 
for food may eat the two or one who is harassed by some 
incurable disease ( such, as leprosy or tuberoulosis ) may 
eat them, the result being that he is either cured or dies. 
Kat. IV. 1. 20 adds that the adhvaryu collects the pindas in a 
pot and the house-holder bends down and takes the smell 
thereof. Uil Then the darbha blades taken out with one stroke 
are thrown into the fire, the utensils are sprinkled with water 
and then taken up in twos and laid aside. 

A householder who had not consecrated the three vedio 
fires also had to perform the pinda-pitr-yajfia on amavasya, but 
he offered it in the grhya fire. Vide As7. Sr. II. 7. 18, Sam. K. 
p. 838 ff, Sam. Pr. 908 ff. Gaut. V. 5 prescribes that a house- 
holder should at least daily offer water to the pitrs and do more 
( i. e- offering food &c.) according to his ability and inclination. 
Manu II. 176 prescribes daily pitr-tarpana ( satiating the pitrs 
with water ), for which see pp. 668-69.

CHAPTER XXXI 

CATURMASYAS (seasonal sacrifices) 2442 

According to Air. II. 14. 1 the term Istyayana comprehends 
the Caturmasyas, Turayana, Daksayana and other istfs. The 
caturmasyas are three ( or four according to some ), viz. Vaisva- 
deva, Varunapraghasa, Sakamedha ( and SunSsIrlya ). Each 
of these is called a parvan ( part or joint ) of the caturmasyas. 
They are called caturmasyas because each of them takes place 
after four months. mJ They are performed respectively on the

purnamftsa istf. Aocording to the com. on Kat. V.l. the Vaisvadeva 
isfl is performed in the morning of the first day after Full Moon 
and then follows the pnrnamfisa istf of PhBlguna. The sacrifioer 
has to keep certain observances on all the parvans of the catur- 
masyas viz. he has to shave'* 4 ' his head and face, to sleep on 
the ground (not on a cot), to avoid honey, meat, salt, sexual 
intercourse and decorations of the body. There is an option as 
to shaving the moustaches and beard viz. he should shave only 
on the first and last parvans or may do so on all four. There 
are five offerings common to all caturmasyas, viz., a purodasa 
(cake) on eight potsherds for Agni, boiled rice (cam) for Soma, a 
purodasa on 12 or 8 potsherds (12 according to Tai. S. I. 8. 2) for 
Savitr (uparh.su, inaudibly), a cam for SarasvatI, a oaru of finely 
ground rice for PQsan. The reward seoured by the performance 
of the caturmasyas" 47 is heaven. The caturmSsyas may be 
performed throughout life or for one year only. 

In the introductory is^i to Vaisvanara and Parjanya, there 
is a oake prepared on twelve potsherds for Vaisvanara and caru 
for Parjanya. Theanuvakya verses (according toAsv.)for the two 
are ' vaisvanaro ajljanad-agnir &c. ' ( Asv. II. 15. 2 sets out the 
whole ) and ' par janyaya pragayata ' ( Rg. VII. 102. 1 ) respec- 
tively and the yajya verses respectively are ' prsfa divi* ( Rg, 
I. 98. 2 ) and * pra vata vanti ' ( Rg. V. 83. 4 ). In the Vaisva- 
deva-parvan itself there are ( besides the five offerings oommon 
to all caturmasyas ) three more offerings viz. a cake ( purodasa ) 
on seven potsherds for Marut Svatavas ( self-strong) or for the 
Maruts, a payasya ( or amiksa, according to Baud. V. I ) 2448 to

the All-Gods ( Visve DevSh ) and a cake on a single potsherd to 
DyivSprthivI ( Heaven and Earth ). 

Kat. ( V. 1. 21-24 ) requires that this Vaisvadeva-parvan 
should be performed in a spot which inclines towards the 
east, 84 *' that the sacrificer and his wife each put on two fresh 
and unworn garments ( one lower and the other upper ) which 
they have to wear again at the Varunapraghasaparvan. Kat. 
(V. 1.25-26) following Sat. Br. (II. 5. 1) says that barhis 
( sacred grass to be strewn on sacrificial ground ) is tied up in 
three bunohes separately with a rope of grass and then all three 
bunches are tied together with a bigger rope and therein ( i. e. 
inside this last rope ) is thrust a bunch of flowering kusa grass, 
which is to be used &Bprastara. After putting the yajnap&tras' 450 
on the sacrificial ground, fire is produced by churning from the 
arayis. Being directed by the adhvaryu the hotr priest repeats 
at the time of churning fire the verses Rg. I. 24. 3, I. 22. 13, 
VL 16. 13-15 ( except the last pada of VI. 16. 15 ) and stops till 
he receives another direction ( sampraisa ) from the adhvaryu. 
If fire is not produced at once the hotr should go on repeating 
the hymn, Rg. X. 118, till fire is struck from the aravis. uii 
On hearing from the adhvaryu that fire is produced and 
that he should repeat a formula for that event, the hotr 
repeats the last pada of Rg. VI. 16. 15 at which he had 
stopped ( after the syllable om added at the end of that 
verse of Rg. X. 118 at which he hears about the production 
of fire ). Then he should repeat Rg. I. 74. 3 and stop after 
repeating half of Rg. VI. 16. 40, then recite Rg. VI. 16. 
41-42, 1. 12. 6, VIII. 43. 14, the verse ' tamarjayanta sukratum ' 
and then repeat Rg. X. 90. 16 as the paridhanlya ( the finishing 
verse ). MSS There are nine prayajas and nine anuyajas in the 
Vaisvadeva-parvan, while in the DarsapQrnamasa there are only

fire pray&jas and three anuyajag. The number nine of the 

prayajas wss is made up by adding before the 5th prayaja of the 
Darsapurnamasa four as stated in the note below. Rg. V. 82. 7 
and VI. 71. 6 are the anuvfikyft and ySjya for the offering to 
Savitr, Rg. VI. 54. 9 and VI. 58. 1 for that to Pu?an and VII. 
59. 11 and VI. 66. 9 for that to Maruts. 8 "* The nine anuySjas 
are made up by adding after the first anuyaja of the darsapurna- 
masa six more. After the anuyajas, or after the suktavaka or 
samyuvaka, an offering of vajina is made to the deities called 
Vajins. The remainder of the vajina is brought in a vessel and 
is dealt with in the same way as idd ( i. e. it is plaoed in the 
folded hands of the hotr by the adhvaryu, the hotr then holds it 
in his left hand and then on the right hand some ghee is sprinkled 
by the adhvaryu and then two portions of the vajina are put 
thereon and then again some ajya is sprinkled over it ), the 
vessel is then raised as high as the mouth or nose, the hotr 
should request the other priests in order ( as done in the note ) 
to repeat an invocation ( upahava ) with a mantra and then the 
hotr, adhvaryu, brahmfi and agnldhra partake of the vajina by 
merely smelling ,4H it. The sacrificer partakes of the vajina 
actually. Kat. ( V. 2. 9 and 12 ) adds that the adhvaryu offers 
three offerings called samigta-yajus respectively to Vata, Yajfia 
and Yajnapati with three mantras ( viz. Vaj. VIII. 21, 22 first 
half and 22 latter half ) or only one samista-yajus may be 
offered ( with Vaj. S. VIII. 21 ) in Vaisvadeva and SunSsIrlya 
parvans. According to the Sat. Br. ( II. 5. 1. 21 ) the daksina 
in this rite is the first born calf of the season. Kat. ( V. 2. 13 ) 
further says that the sacrificer may on finishing each of the 
three caturmSsyas ( except Sunaslrlya ) shave himself.

Jai. ( IV. 1. 22-24 ) concludes that amiksa is the principal 
purpose of mixing curds in boiled milk and not vHjina and in 
VIII. 2. 1-9 that in offering vajina the procedure of isti is to be 
followed and not of SomaySga though iruti in one passage

Varugapraghasa." 5 * 

The word Varunapraghasa is masculine and is always 
employed in the plural. The Sat. Br. ( II. 5. 2. 1 ) gives a 
fanciful etymology viz. that yavas ( barley grains ) belong to 
Varuna and as these are eaten ( from ghas to eat ) in this rite 
it is so called. This rite is performed in the rainy season four 
months after Vaisvadeva on the Full Moon day of Asadha or 
of Sravana- The sacrificor should go out of his house to a spot 
where plenty of shrubs grow. Two altars ( vedi ) have to be 
prepared to the east of the ahavanlya inclined towards the east, 
one south of the other. The northern vedi is in charge of the 
adhvaryu and the southern one in charge of his assistant, the 
pratiprasth&tr ( Ap. VIII. 5. 5. ). The latter follows the adh- 
varyu in doing the same aotions on the southern vedi that are 
done by the adhvaryu on the northern vedi except carrying 
the water forward, girding the wife, producing fires and a few 
others specified in Eat. V. 4. 33 ; all the orders ( sampraisas, 
like ' agnaye samidhyamSn&ya anubruhi ') are to be uttered once 
and everything that concerns the uttering of words is to be 
done by the adhvaryu only ( Ap. VIII. 5. 17 )** ST . But Jai. XII. 
1. 18 says that the mantras for taking ajya, for proksana and 
the like are to be reoited by the two separately. The procedure 
is like that of Vaisvadevaparvan except where special directions 
are given. The two vedis are separated from each other by a 
space ( at the corners ) two, three or four angulas or a span or 
even wider ( Ap. VIII. 5. 10 ). There is a single utkara. The 
pratiprasthatr moves between the two vedis. On the previous 
day he makes ready pots full of karambha i. e. husked grains 
of barley slightly fried on the daksina fire, ground and mixed 

2456. Vide Tai.S. I. 8. 3, V5j. S. III. 44-47, Tai. Br. I. 6 4, Sat. 
Br. II. 5. 2, 5<v. II. 17, Band V. 5-9, K5t. V. 3-5, Ap. VIII. 5-9. 

2457. Jaimini XI. 2. 35-43 deals with the question that pratipra- 
sthSti does on the southern vedi whatever adhvaryu does on the nothern. 
Jai. further ( XI. 2. 44-48 ) states that though there are two vedii and 
the pratiprasthstr follows the adhvaryu in doing all that he does, there 
is not a double set of priests.

with curds ( Kat. V. 3. % ). According to Ap. ( VIII. 6. 3 ) if; 
is the wife that makes these karambhapatras. These patras 
exceed by one the number of the children ( sons, unmarried 
daughters, grandsons and unmarried grand-daughters ) of the 
house-holder ( Kat. V. 3. 3-5, Ap. VIII. 5. 41, who inoludes 
daughters-in-law ) or they are at least three ( if the house-holder 
is childless or has only a son or two ). The figures of a ram 
and ewe are also made of the remaining part of the ground 
and fried barley used for the karambhapatras, the male being 
made by the adhvaryu and the female by the pratiprasthatr 
and each figure having the characteristic signs of sex. The 
figures of the ram and ewe are covered by the adhvaryu and 
pratiprasthatr respectively with a bunch of the wool of some 
animal other than the edaka ( wild goat ) or with the ground 
tips of kusa ( in the absence of wool ). Besides the five offerings 
common to all oaturmasyas ( these being offered in the Varuna- 
praghasas with all attributes and subsidiaries as in Vaisva- 
deva, according to Jai. VII. 1. 17-21 ), in this rite offerings are 
made to four more, viz. Indra and Agni, the Maruts, Varuna 
and Ea i. e. Prajapati (As v. II. 17. 14) and the offerings are a 
cake on twelve potsherds (for Indragnl), payasya or amiksa 
( for Maruts and Varuna ) and a cake on one potsherd for 
Ea silently. All offerings are made from yava or only the 
karambhapatras are so made and the figures of the ram and 
the ewe also are made from yava and the rest from rice grains 
( Ap. VIII. 5. 36-37 ). The anuvakya and yajya verses of 
eaoh of these four special offerings to Indragnl, Maruts, Varuna 
and Ea are respectively" 88 Bg. VII. 94. 18, VI. 60. 1; I. 86. 1, 
V. 58. 5; I. 25. 19, 1. 24. 11; IV. 31. 1, X. 121. 1 ( Asv. II. 17. 15 ). 
Straight to the east of the ahavanlya about three prakramas 
from it the northern vedi is prepared and several rules are 
laid down in Kat. (V. 3. 13 ff) and its oom. about its 
extent. The northern vedi is six or seven aratnis in length from 
west to east, its western side is four aratnis and its eastern side 
is three aratnis or the vedi may be even much larger than this. 
On this vedi a fire-plaoe is constructed with the earth dug up 
from the sacrificial pit oalled catvala whioh is measured with 
a yoke-pin 32 angulas in length and made to the east of the 
utkara and after leaving a space between it and the utkara for 



2458. Vide Tai. S. IV. 2. 11 for mostly other anuvSkySs and yij- 
ySs of the four speoial offerings and other offerings, though all of them 
occur in the 9gTeda.

the priests to more about. The pit is knee-deep, is outside tbs 
uttaravedi to its east and is measured from the northern corner 
of the uttaravedi at a distance equal to the yoke-pin and is square, 
the east side being 32 angulas in extent or } of-the vedi or of the 
extent of a yoke or of ten steps of the yajamana ( on all sides ). 
In the midst of the northern vedi a hole ( nabhi ) is made, a span 
in length on four sides and having four corners or it may be as 
large as the hoof of a bull or a horse. On the uttaravedi water is 
sprinkled with a mantra and gravel is also spread with 'a lioness 
art thou' (Vaj. S. V. 10). That night the uttaravedi is covered with 
darbhas. In the morning the adhvaryu and pratiprasthatr carry 
forward fire on to the two vedis from the g&rhapatya ( according 
to Ap. VIII. 5. 22 ) or from the ahavanlya ( according to Eat. 
V. 4. 2-3) by means of kindled fuel-sticks (idhma)held in 
earthen pots or by dividing the ahavanlya in two parts. Jai. 
( VIL 3. 23-25 ) declares that the carrying forward of the fire 
is done only in the Varunapraghasas and Sakamedhas. The 
pratiprasthatr draws with the sphya a line from the ahavanlya 
to the northern hind corner of the southern vedi or of the uttara- 
vedi ( according to K&t. V. 4. 9-10 ) or he connects the two 
vedis ( Ap. VIII. 5. 20 ) by drawing a line from the north hind 
corner of the southern vedi to the south front oorner of the 
uttaravedi. He surrounds the hole ( nabhi ) with three sticks 
( paridhis ), one span long, of devadaru tree on the west, south 
and north ( with Vaj. S. V. 13 ) and puts down thereon guggulu 
( bdellium ) and perfumed substances and the hair on the head 
or between the horns of a ram and places the fires on these 
materials ( sambharas ). The pratiprasthatr places daksina 
fire on a square mound of one aralni in length after drawing 
lines and sprinkling water. The figure of the ram is put in 
the payasya meant for Maruts and that of the ewe in the 
payasya meant for Varuna. The liquid called vajina ( of both 
payasyas ) is collected in separate pots and in the payasya are 
put the- fruit of karlra and leaves of saml. All the offerings 
except the payasya for Maruts and the pots of karambha are 
plaoed by the adhvaryu on the uttaravedi; while the pratiprasthatr 
places the payasya for Maruts together with the pot for ajya 
and also the karambha pot ( if the yava grains for them had 
not been taken out by the adhvaryu ) on the southern vedi and 
the vajina is plaoed near the utkara by both. When the adhvaryu 
issues a direction to the agnldhra 'please sweep olean the paridhis 
of the two fires' (the two ahavanlyas on the two vedis) with 
the ropes binding the idhma, the pratiprasthatr goes to the 
h.d. 138

saorificer's wife sitting near the garhapatya and asks her to 
declare what lover or lovers ( jara ) M *' she has. She either 
declares the names of her lovers or lifts up ( if she feels 
shame in the declaration ) as many blades from the bunoh 
of darbhas lying on the ground as the number of lovers 
she has had. If she names any, he ( the pratiprasthatr ) 
deolares that Varuna will seize him or them. If she con- 
oeals the truth, the result would be that her dear rela- 
tives would suffer. If she has none she says so. In that 
case or when she has declared or intimated her lover or 
lovers, the pratiprasthatr makes her repeat the verse 'praghasino 
hav&mahe ' ( V&j. III. 44 ). The pots are placed in a surpa 
made of islka ( reed ) in whioh a little ajya is sprinkled, then 
there is further sprinkling of ajya thereon twice ( abhigbarana ), 
the surpa is placed on the head of the wife who is led by the 
pratiprasthatr between the fires and the seats of the brahmft 
priest and the sacrifioer to the east of both Shavanlyas and 
then to the northern vedi ; and she standing to the east of the 
daksina fire with her face to the west takes down from her head 
the surpa into her right hand and offers the contents ( using 
the surpa ** 80 as a juhu ladle ) into the daksina fire with ' mo su 
na indr&tra ' ( Bg. 1. 173. 12, Vaj. S. III. 46 or Tai. S. I. 8. 3. 1 ) 
muttered by the sacrifioer and with the verse ' yad grame ' 
( Vaj. S. III. 45, Tal. S. I. 8. 3. 1 ) uttered by the wife as offering 
prayer (yfijy a ). Ap. (VIII. 6. 26 ) says that the adhvaryu or 
pratiprasthatr may offer the oblation of karambha pots and the 
sacrifioer and his wife may only touch his hand from behind. 
When the pratiprasthatr leads back the wife to her seat near the 
garhapatya fire ( by the same way that she came ) he makes her 
repeat the verse ' akran karma ' ( Vaj. S. III. 47, Tai. S. 1. 8. 3. 1 ). 
Then the adhvaryu offers the five offerings common to all 
oaturmasyas ( stated above ) and the cake to Indra and Agni 

S469. This is based on the Tai. Br. I. 6. 5 ■ irsrre «** Wi^

refers to the commission of sins and the expiation thereof) as the 
yljyl by both.

on twelve potsherds and then sits silent. Then the prati- 
prasthatr outs off a poition of the amikaa for Maruts together 
with the whole of the figure of the ewe (this is the first avadftna) 
and offers it into fire. He mixes the second portion of the 
payasya for Maruts with the leaves of saml and fruits of karlra 
and offers it. Then the adhvaryu offers two portions from the 8ml- 
ksa meant for Varuna mixing the figure of the ram in the first 
or second avadana for Varuna. According to Ap. (VIII. 6. 31) 
the adhvaryu offers the first portion of the payasya along with 
the figure of the ram and the seoond portion of payasya having 
in it the fruit of karlra and the leaves of saml. Then the adh- 
varyu offers the cake to Ka silently. Then both adhvaryu and 
pratiprasthatr make an offering to Agni Svistakrt. The fee 
( daksina ) is either a cow with its calf or a horse or six or 
twelve bulls. ,4M 

The rite is concluded by the priests and the saorifioer and his 
wife going for a bath (avabhrtha) in a river' 1 " or the like taking 
with them the remainder of payasya for Varuna and the scrap- 
ings from the pan that are treated like the refuse (rjlsa of Soma). 
The remainder of payasya serves as havis ( sacrificial offering ) 
at the avabhrtha, a portion of which is offered to Varuna and 
the whole of what remains is offered to Agni and Varuna 
instead of to Agni Svis^akrt. The saorifioer and his wife silently 
oome to the water, throw into the water the sorapings ( nisk&sa ) 
that are placed in a vessel (sthall) with a mantra (Vaj. S. Ill, 48, 
according to Eat. V. 5. 30 and ' samudre te ' Tai. S. I. 4. 45. 2, 
according to Ap. VIII. 8. 12 ). They do not plunge their heads 
into water but only splash water over their heads and rub each 
other's backs with water. They then put on new olothes and 
make a gift of the clothes so far worn ( that they had already 
worn at the Vaisvadeva-parvan ) to one of the ( five ) priests or 
to another ( worthy ) person at their pleasure. After returning 
to the house the sacrificer puts a fuel-stick on the ahavanlya 
( with V«j. S. VIII. 27 ). Jai. ( VII. 3. 12-15 ) states that this 
avabhrtha has the same characteristics as the avabhrtha in 



2461. Aocording to Ap. ( VIII. 7. 5-7 ) a full grown ball is the fee 
or the sacrificer may give more at hia pleasure and he gays that gome 
teaohers prescribe a oow as the fee. 

2462. Aocording to Ap. VIII. 8. 15 the saorifioer invokes the water 
with ' devlr-Spah ' (Tai. 8. 1. 4. 45. 3 ) and repeats ' sumitriyK na «pa ' 
( Tai. 8. 1. 4. 45. t ) when going into the water,

from the pan and not the purodasa ( VII. 3. 16 ). 

Sakamedha' 4 ' 1 

This third parvan of the c&turmasyas is described at 
great length in Baud., Ap. and Eat. Only a few salient 
features are brought out below. ' Sakamedha ' is used in the 
plural, sinoe there are many rites therein and many and 
various offerings ( com. on Kftt. V. 6. 1 ). It literally means 
' kindling along with or at the same time as* (s&kam edha). 
The name is probably given beoause the first offering in it is a 
cake on eight potsherds offered to Agni Anlkavat with the ris- 
ing sun."* 4 It is performed four months after the Varuna- 
praghasas on the Full Moon day of KSrtika or Margaslrsa 
( according as the Vaisvadeva-parvan was performed on the 
full moon of Ph&lguna or Caitra ). The whole of this parvan 
requires two days. On the day previous to the full moon there 
are three is^is offered at the three savanas ( morning, midday 
and evening) to the three deities respectively, viz. to Agni 
Anlkavat a cake on eight potsherds in the morning, to Sanfca- 
pana Maruts cant (oblation of cooked rice) at midday, to 
Grhamedhin Maruts in the evening a cam boiled in the milk of 
all the cows belonging to the sacrificer ( Ap. VIII. 9. 8 ). As 
regards this last caru it is stated ( Ap. VIII. 10. 8 and VIII. 11. 
8-10, Eat. V. 6. 29-30 ) that if plenty of rice is oooked the 
priests and the sons and grandsons of the sacrificer ( who have 
had the upanayana performed ) eat the food to satiety and go to 
sleep that night in the same hall without indulging in any talk 
about poverty or hunger. Jaimini ( V. 1. 19-22 ) refers to the 
text ' agnaye anlkavate pr&tar-astakapalah &o.' and states as 
the conclusion that all the three rites are performed on one day 
and no part of the three is to be performed the next day. On 
that night the milch cows are let loose to mix up among their 
oalves (which can then drink the milk of their mothers with- 
out let or hindrance). He, however, binds down that calf 
whioh is required for milking the oow that has lost its own oalf 
( and whioh is to be milked the next morning for the offerings

to the Manes ). That night and in the next morning agnihotra 
is performed with rice gruel ( and not with milk ). On the 
next day ( the principal day of Sskamedha ) the saorificer either 
before or after the daily agnihotra performs a noma with a darvi 
taking a portion of the boiled rice sticking to the bottom of the 
sthill ( pot ) that had been cooked for the offering to Grhamedhin 
Maruts the previous evening. He fills the darvi ,4 ** (ladle) 
with a mantra (Vaj. S. III. 49, Tal S. I. 8. 4. 1). Then the 
adhvaryu directs the yajaroana to fetch a bull and make it 
bellow. When the bull bellows, he offers the rice in the darvi 
into fire with a mantra ( Vftj. S. III. 50, Tai. 8. 1. 8. 4. 1 ). If 
the bull does not bellow, then the oblation is offered after the 
brahma prieBt directs ' offer '. Asv. ( II. 18. 11-12 ) states that 
the homa may be offered ( if the bull does not bellow ) at the 
thunder of a cloud or some make the agnldhra roar calling him 
'brahmaputra'ftheson of the brahma priest ', whose assistant 
he Is ). The bull is given as fee to the adhvaryu. Then an 
is^i is offered to Krldin Maruts with a cake cooked on seven 
potsherds and a cam to Aditi. This is followed by a mahahavie 
( a great offering ), which consists of eight offerings to eight 
deities. They are five offerings common to all caturraSsyas, the 
6th offering is a cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni, the 
7th is earn to Mahendra (or according to Asv. II. 18. 18 to Indra, 
or Vrtrahan Indra or Mahendra ), the 8th is a cake on one 
potsherd to Visvakarman UH ( inaudibly ). According to Ap. he 
offers the 8th offering of a cake after taking the names of the 
four months Sahas, Sahasya, Tapas and Tapasya ( i e. Marga- 
fllrsa to Phalguna ). A bull is the fee of this Mahahavis ( or a 
cow acoording to Ap. ). 

After the mahahavis comes the pitryajfia whioh is called 
mahapitryajna. To the south of the daksina fire a new vedi 
having four oorners in the four principal directions"' 7 is 
prepared and has the same length and breadth as the height 



2466. According to the com. on Ext. V. 6. 40 this darvi-homa ii 
offered in the Shavaniya, while according to Ap. VIII. 11. 19 it is offered 
in Glrhapatya. The oblation is meant for Indra. 

8466. Acoording to Asv. II. 18. 18, ?g. IV. 32. 1 and VI. 25. 8 are 
the anuvHkyS and yljyB respectively for Indra or Mahendra and $g. 
X. 81. 6 and X. 81. 6 respectively for Visvakarman. 

2467. According: to Est. V. 8. 21 the four oorners face the inter- 
mediate quarters and he relies on Sat. Br. II. 6. 1. 10. Vide 8. B. X.

of the sacrifioer ( Ap. VIII. 13. 2 ). He brings fire from the 
daksina fire and lays it on the new vedi in the oentre and all 
offerings that are to be offered in the ahavanlya are offered 
in this fire. In this mah&pitryajna the wife does nothing. In 
this yajfia a cake on six kapalas is offered to Somavat Pitrs or 
to Pitrmat Soma, dhanas (fried barley) to Barhisad Pitrs, 
mcmtha "** to Agnisv&tta Pitrs. Asv. II. 19. 21 adds another 
deity viz. Yama and aooording to some ( vide Ap. VIII. 13. 16 ) 
the devatas and offerings are ajya to Pitrmat Soma, a cake on 
six potsherds to Barhisad Pitrs, fried barley to Agnisvatta Pitrs 
and mantba to Yama or Agni Kavyav&hana or Yama A.ngi- 
rasvat Pitrmat. The beating of grains ( with a pestle ) and 
grinding is done by the adhvaryu or agnldhra to the east of 
the g&rhapatya fire with his face to the south. The cake is 
cooked on burning coals taken with a shovel from the garha- 
patya to its south and the dhana is fried on the daksinSgni. 
There are only four pray&jas ( omitting barhis out of the five 
at the darsapQrnamasa ) and so also anuyajas. Instead of the 
usual direotion ( called asruta ) of the adhvaryu to the agnl- 
dhra '0 sr&vaya', in this rite he utters ' Om svadha'; simi- 
larly the agnldhra responds ( praty asruta ) with 'astu svadha' 
instead of the usual ' astu srausat ' and instead of the syllable 
' vausat ' uttered at the end the words ' svadha namah ' are 
employed. Instead of the concluding offering usually made to 
Agni Svistakrt, in this rite it is made to Agni Kavyav&hana. 
In this rite two anuvakyas and one yajya are repeated at eaoh 
offering i. e. Bg. X. 15. 1, IX. 96. 11 are the two anuvakyas 
and Bg- X 15. 5 the y&jya for Somavat Pitrs, Bg. I. 91. t and 
I. 91. 20 are the anuvakyas and VIII. 48. 13 the yajya for 
Pitrmat Soma, Bg- X. 15. 4 and X. 15. 3 the anuvakyas and 
Bg. X 15. 2 the yajyft for Barhisad Pitrs, Bg. X 15. 11 and 
13 the anuvakyas and X. 15. 14 the y&jya for Agnisv&tta Pitrs, 
Bg. X. 14. 4-5 the anuvakyas and X. 14. 1 the yajya for Yama, 
Bg. X. 15. 9 and IV. 11. 3 the anuvakyas and I. 96. 1 the yajya 
for Agni Kavyav&hana ( vide Asv. II. 19. 22, 24 ). The adh- 
varyu or sacrifioer sprinkles water from a water vessel thrice 

2468. The cow that has no calf of its own but yields milk on haring 
the oalf of another is called ftftr*9T. Its milk is put in a vessel in 
which half ground barley grains are laid and then stirred onoe or thrice, 
aooording to Ap. VIII. 14. 14, with a piece of sugar-cane to which is 
tied a string. He does not directly touch the pieoe of sugar-cane when 
stirring, but stirs it by moving the string and the stirring is done from 
right to left. This preparation to Stirred Is called tnanHha,

round the vedi from right to left. He offers water for washing 
the feet to the three ancestors ( of the saorifioer ) in the north- 
west, south-west and south-east corners of the vedi respectively. 
He mixes portions of the cake, the fried barley and the mantha 
and prepares three balls therefrom and offers them facing the 
south on the three corners referred to above for the three ances- 
tors with the appropriate mantras ( etat te tata '*" ye ca tv&m- 
anu, etat te pitfimaha &c. ). According to Ap. ( VIII. 16. 7 ) 
he prepares three more pindas for the three ancestors beyond 
the paternal great-grand-father and invokes them on the pindas 
in the reverse order i. e. the sixth anoestor on the first ( out of 
these other three pindas ), the fifth on the 2nd pinda and the 
fourth on the 3rd. He then wipes off the remnants of the pindas 
( pindalepa ) sticking to the hand on the north-eastern corner 
of the vedi with ' atra pitaro * ( Vaj. S. II. 31 first half ). The 
priests and the sacrificer with faces to the north leave that place, 
wear the sacred thread in the upavlta form and wait upon the 
ahavanlya with Vaj. S. III. 51-53 ( = Tai. 3. I. 8. 5. 1-2 ), and 
on the garhapatya with Vaj. S. III. 53-55 ( =Tai. S. I. 8. 5. 2-3). 
Then entering the vedi the sacrificer, wearing the sacred thread 
in the pracln&vlta form, mutters the mantra ' amlmadanta' (Vaj. 
S. II. 3i latter half). They sprinkle the vedi from left to 
right and do all the rest as in pindapitryajfia. The sacrifioer 
then folds his hands with ' namo vah ' ( Vaj. S. IL 32 ) or 
makes six namaskaras ( salutations ) and invokes the blessing 
' give us house * ( Vaj. S. II. 32 ). This rite ends with JaJarhyu 

( As7. II. 19. 2, Kat. V. 9, 32) i. e. 'taccharhyorS sam 

oatuspade ' ( Tai. Br. III. 5. 11 ) and there is no patnlsarhy&ja 
homa in daksina fire and so on. The remaining portion of the 
material for offerings is thrown into the fire or into water or 
may be eaten by the priests. 

The last rite in the Sakamedhas is the Traiyambaka homa. 
Vide Tai. a I. 8. 6, Sat Br. II. 6. 2. 1-17, Asv. IL 19. 37-40, 
ip. VIII. 17-19, Baud. V. 16-17, Kat. V. 10. This homa is 
offered to Budra. Some of its peculiarities may be noted. In 
this the adhvaryu takes out material to prepare cakes cooked 
on one potsherd exoeeding by one the ohildren ( the sons and 
grandsons together with their wives and unmarried daughters ) 
of the saorifioer or at least four ( if he is childless or has no 
more than a few ohildren). Every thing is done faoing the

north and all places where offerings are to be made must be to 
the north. He oooks the oakes on the northern side of the gar- 
hapatya and may anoint the cake with clarified butter, MT0 he 
carries a single smoking firebrand kindled at the daksina fire 
with the mantra ' eka eva rudro ' ( Tai S. I. 8. 6 ). All ( priests 
and relatives ) go to a spot near by in the north-east and lay 
down one cake on earth dug out by rats from a hole with the 
words ' O Budra ! the rat is thy beast ' ( Tai. S. I. 8. 6. 1. ) or if 
one has an enemy and one hates him one may think of him 
and offer that cake with the words ' that is thy beast '. He 
places the single firebrand in a spot where four roads meet and 
whioh has the usual fire purifying rites performed on it and 
offers thereon with the middle leaflet of a pal&sa leaf ( used as 
the juhu ladle ) portions out off once eaoh from all the oakes 
prepared for Budra with the mantra ' O Budra ! this Is your 
portion, may you partake of it together with Ambika, your 
sister, svahs ' ( Tai. S. 1. 8. 6 = Vaj. S. III. 57 ). The remainder 
he places on the earth heap dug up by rats and covers it with 
earth. After coming back from the heap, the saorificer and 
the priests mutter a mantra ( Vaj. S. III. 58 ) or only the 
yajamSna mutters the same mantra ( Tai. S. L 8. 6 ). The yaja- 
mana, his ohildren and his wife and other ladies go round the 
fire thrice from right to left ( as in pitryajna ) with the famous 
mantra ' Tryambakam yajamahe ' ( Tai S. I. 8. 6 and Vaj. S. 
IIL 60) striking their left thigh with their right hand and 
again thrice striking their right thigh with their right hand. 
The unmarried daughter of the yajamana desirous of a husband 
should go round the fire from right to left and again from left 
to right ( thrice in eaoh mode ), with the above mantra altered 
to suit her case ( Vaj. S. IIL 60 )."" The portions of the oakes 
that remain are thrown up in the air by the yajamana so high 
that a oow ( or bull ) with upturned mouth cannot reach them 
and he catches them in his hand one after another. un If he

of life or soul ). Est. V. 10. 10-13 and Ip. VIII. 17. 9-12 differ in the 
order of offerings to Budra and on the rubbish dug out by rats. 

2471. ip. VIII. 18. 2 says (against Kst. V. 10. 15 ) that they go 
round from left to right. Her mantra becomes ' s*r**f*J WW% BTlGtr

joined hands of the yajamSna and this is done thiioe.

ground. They are then placed in two woyen baskets < half and 
half ), which are then hung from the two ends of a bamboo pole 
or the beam of a scale or a pole made of a saorifioial tree and he 
fastens them on two sides on a tree trunk, or a tree or a bamboo 
or ant-hill, in such a way that a cow or bull oannot reach 
them, with the mantra ( Vaj. S. III. 61 first part, Tat S. I. 8. 6

&c. * (Vaj. S. III. 61 latter half and Tai S. I. 8. 6 ) repeatedly 
without taking breath and do so thrice ( acoordjng to Ap. 
VIII. 18. 9 ). They ( priests and yajamana ) return to the plaoe 
where the other rites were performed and touoh water. Accord- 
ing to Ap. ( VIII. 19. 1-3 ) a white horse is the daksinS or a 
white bull or a bull that has a white spot of hair.

Besides the five offerings common to all oaturmasyas, the 
special offerings in this Istf are a cake on twelve potsherds to 
Sunaslrau ( Vfiyu and Aditya, according to com. on Kit. V. 11. 5 
and to Indra Sunaslra, acoording to Ap. VIII. 20. 5 and com. ), 
an oblation of fresh warm milk ( not heated ) direct from the 
cow to Vayu, a cake on one potsherd to Sorya. There is no 
uttaravedi in this rite, and no fire is produced by attrition. There 
are five prayajas, three anuyajas and one samistayajus, but 
according to Ap. VIII. 20. 6 there are nine prayajas and 
anuyajas. The daksina for the rite is a plough with six 
bulls or two big bulls and for the cake to Surya a white 
"horse or a white bull (Kat. V. 11. 12-14), while according 
to Tai. S. I. 8. 7 it is a plough to whioh twelve oxen are yoked 
and according to Ap. ( VIII. 20. 9-10 ) a plough with twelve 
or six oxen. 

' Sunaslrau ' occurs in the Rgveda IV. 57. 5 and 8. In Rg. 
IV. 57. "4 and 8 the word * sunam* ocours several times. The 
meaning is doubtful. According to Y&ska's Nirukta IX. 40 
Sura and Slra mean Vayu and Aditya respectively ; while the 
Sat. Br. II. 6. 3. 2 appears to hold that iuna means prosperity 
and sira means ' essence or sap ' ( sara ) and this isti is so called 
because the sacrifioer thereby secures both prosperity and sap.

Agrayaga ( offering of first fruits )

This is an is^i, without performing which an Uhitagrd was 
not to make use of freshly harvested rice, barley and millet. 
It was either performed on a New Moon day or Full Moon 
day, but the prooedure was the same as that of the istf on New 
Moon. The time of the agrayana is^i with rice is iarad (autumn) 
when one had ample rains. MW As barley crops became ready 
in vasanta ( spring ), the agrayana for yavas was to be per* 
formed in spring. Asv. allowed an option that when the istf 
was once performed in the autumn one may not perform it in 
spring for the barley crop. The is^i for millet crop ( syfim&ka ) 
was performed in the rainy season and therein a caru was 
offered to Soma. The istf was so called because therein 
the first fruits ( agra ) were first employed or eaten ( ayana ). ,m 
According to Ap. (VI. 29. 6) there are 17 kindling verses 
( samidhenl ), whioh number is obtained by inserting two 
additional verses called dhayya after the 8th or 9th samidhenl 
of the darsa-purna-masa isti. The deities and offerings are a oake 
on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni ( or according to Ap. 
VI. 29. 10 and Asv. II. 9. 13, it is either Aindrfigna or Agnendra ), 
' a oaru cooked in milk or water for All Gods ( Visve Devah ) 
silently, a oake on one potsherd to Heaven and Earth and oaru 
to Soma ( if the first fruits are millets ). Eat. IV. 6. 7 allows 
an option that the caru for All Gods may be of old rice.

perform any i?ti except darsaptirnamasa Eat. IV. 6. 11 and Asv. 
II. 9. 4 prescribe that he may make his agnihotra cow eat the 
first fruits, viz., rice or barley bundles or food and with the 
milk of that cow perform on the figrayana day the homa. But 
this alternative was not open to the king who bad to perform 
this iati ( Asv. II. 9. 6 ). According to Est. ( IV. 6. 16-17 ) the 
oaru of millets for Soma is performed only for the forest-dweller 
and a caru of bamboo seed is prescribed for Soma in summer. 
About the daksina there are various opinions. According to 
Kafc. ( IV. 6. 18 ) it is either a repaired waggon or silken oloth, 
madhuparka ( i. e. honey, curds and ghee ) or the cloth worn by 
the sacrifioer in the rains. According to Ap. ( VI. 30. 7 ) the 
first among the calves born before the Full Moon of Magha is 
the fee, and cloth for isti with millets. Jai. has several sutras 
about silk cloth and a calf being the daksina in this rite and 
that rice cooked on daksina fire is not the fee ( vide X. 3. 34-38 ). 
Vide also Jai. XII. 2. 31-37 ( about the characteristics of the 
bar his ). 

The agrayana sacrifice in the grhya fire has been already 
described ( pp. 827-829 ) and it will have been noticed that it 
was a replica of the srauta sacrifice meant for those who had 
oonsecrated the three Vedio fires. 

Kamyestl 

In the Srauta sutras there are rules for the performance of 
several istis on the occurrence of certain events or for the pur- 
pose of securing some desired object. Asv. II. 10-14, Ap. XIX. 
18-27 and others mention several such i?tis, viz., the ayuska- 
meetii ( for one desirous of long life ), the svastyayanl ( for safe 
journey ), the putrakamestf MW ( for one desirous of a son or one 
adopting a son, Asv. II. 10. 8-9 ), Loke&, MaMvairafi ( Asv. II. 
11. 1-4 ) or Mitravinda ( Kat. V. 12, for one who is desirous of 
prosperity, territory, friends and long life, addressed to ten 
deities ), Sarhjfiani ( for the reconciliation of those who have 
fallen out ), Kariristi u '" ( for one who desires rain, Asv. IL 13. 
1-13, Ap. XIX 25. 16 ff), Turayava (Asv. II. 14. 4-6), 



2478. The KBlikSpurSpa quoted in the VyayahKramayUkha ( p. 114 
text ) prescribes that on adopting a son who is about five years old ( or 
more ) the adopter should perform the putresfi. 

2479. In the KBririfti the saorifloer had to wear a dark garment 
having dark hetn. Tai. S. ( II. 4. 7-10) deals with this isfi.

CHAPTER XXXII 

PAS'UBANDHA or NIRUDHAPASUBANDHA™ 
( immolation of an animal in sacrifice ). 

The animal sacrifice is an independent sacrifice and it is 
also perfoimed in soma sacrifices as a constituent part ( afiga ). 
The independent animal sacrifice is called nirudhapasubandha 
( offering of an eviscerated animal ) and the subordinate ones 
are called saumika ( Asv. IIL 8. 3-4 ). The nirudhapasu is 
really a modification of an animal sacrifice in somayaga 
( called agnlsomlya pasu ) as Jai. VIII. 1. 13 declares, but in 
many sutras the full prooednre of both i$ Bet out in the nirudha- 
pasu section ( vide Kftt. VI. 10. 32 and com. on Kat. VL 1. 31 ). 
The nirudhapasubandha itself becomes the prakrti ( arche- 
type or model ) of all other animal sacrifices, except savanlya 
pasu and anubandhyapasu. The independent animal sacrifice 
is to be performed every six months or every year by the 
nhitagni throughout his life.* 48 * If done once a year it was to be 
performed in the rainy season ( i. e. in Sravana or Bh&drapada ) 
on New moon or Full moon day or if done six monthly then at 
the beginning of the southward and northward passages of the 
Sun ( daksinayana and uttar&yana ). Then it may have to be 
performed on any day and not necessarily on amavasyS or 
paurnamasl. According to Asv. (III. 1. 2-6 ) optionally an istf 
before and after the independent pasubandha rite may be per- 
formed and if performed it is offered either to Agni or to Agni- 
Visnu or to Agni and Agni-Visnu. In this sacrifice there is 
a sixth priest called Maitravaruna ( or Pras&str ) in addition to 
the five required in the caturmasyas. An udumbara staff is 
given to the sacrifioer when he is initiated for a sacrifice like 
Agnistoma. In the pasubandha when the Maitravaruna enters 
the sacrificial ground after the priests are ohosen the adhvaryu

beginning of the ayanat. Ap. VII. 8. 2-3 and Baud, IV. 1 set out the

( or yajamftna in some s&khSs ) un hands over that staff ( whioh 
in length would reach the mouth of the sacrifice!) to the 
maitr&varuna with a mantra and the maitr&varuna accepts it 
with a corresponding mantra. The maitr&varuna stands slightly 
bent to the south of the seat of the hotr resting his staff on 
the vedi and utters directions to the hotr to repeat y&jy&s. 
Till he utters the first praisa he is not to touch himself or any 
one else with the staff. The maitr&varuna is to utter in a 
standing posture while holding the staff the praisas and the 
anuvfiky&s wherever a praisa is employed and do a few other 
acts standing ; but the rest of his duties in soma sacrifices he 
does sitting. Jaimini ( IV. 2. 16-18 ) has a discussion ( arising 
out of Tai. S. VI. 1. 4. 2 ' krlte some maitr&varun&ya ' dandam 
prayaoohati ' ) on the question whether the handing over of the 
staff to maitr&varuna is a pratipattikarma or an arthakarma ( the 
oonolusion is that it is the latter ). The adhvaryu makes an _ 
offering of clarified butter in the Shavanlya, whioh is called 
yup&huti, with the sruva or with a sruc in whioh four ladlings 
of fijya have been poured, with the mantra ' uru visno ' ( Vij. S. 

V. 41, Tai. S.L 3. 4. 1). The adhvaryu, taking the rest of the &jya 
and the sruva, goes to a place where trees grow, accompanied by 
a oarpenter ( taksan ) holding an axe ( Ap. VII. 1. 13 and K&t. VI. 
1. 5 ). The sacrificial post (yupaf* u is to be made of the pal&sa, 
khadira, bilva or rauhitaka tree according as one desires various 
rewards (Ap. VII. 1.16), but in Soma sacrifices the yupa must be 
of khadira, if possible. Jai. ( VI. 3. 28-30 ) states that, if by 
accident the saorificial post made of one kind of tree is 
destroyed during the oontinuance of the rite, another yupa of 
the same tree or of a tree very similar to it is to be substituted. 
The tree to be out must be full of leaves, must not have its top 
dried up, must be straight and growing on a level spot, and its 
branches must be turned upwards and it should be bent in 
Borne direction other than the south. Adhvaryu, brahma, the 
sacrificer and carpenter touch the tree after selecting it with 
the mantra ' atyany&n ' ( Vaj. S. V. 42, Tai. S. I. 3. 5 ). The 
adhvaryu touches the trunk of the tree all round ( where it is 
to be out ) with the sruva anointed with ajya with the mantra

' May god Savitr anoint thee with madhu ' ( Tai. S. I. 3. 5 ) or 
with ' Visnave tv8 * ( Vaj. S. V. 43 ). He keeps obliquely a 
darbha blade on the trunk with the words 'osadhe trayasvainam' 
(Tai. S. I. 3. 5 or Vfij. 8. V. 42 ) and strikes the tree with the 
axe with the mantra 'O axe! do not injure it* ( svadhite mainam 
himsIhV Vaj. S. V. 42 and Tai. 8. I. 3. 5 ). The first chip of the 
tree that is cut off, he keeps in a well-known place and the tree 
is cut at such a low height from the ground that the stump left 
in the ground would not strike against the axle of a cart going 
that way. The tree should be so cut that it should not fall to 
the south ; it should fall to the east or north or north-east ( Ap. 
VII. 2. 7 ) ; when it is falling he repeats the mantra * do not 
scratch the heaven with your top &o. ' (Vaj. 8. V. 43 or Tai. 8. 1. 
3. 5 ). He offers Sjya with the juhu on the stump of the tree 
with the mantra ' O tree, grow again with a hundred shoots ' 
( Vaj. S. V. 43, Tai. S. I. 3. 5 ) and having touched one's body 
with ' may we grow into a thousand branches ' ( ibid. ) he cuts 
off from the bottom upwards the twigs and knots of the felled 
tree. There were several views about the length of the yupa 
( Ap. VII. 2. 11-17, Kat. VI. 1. 24-26 ). According to some the 
yupa may be of any length from one aratni to 33 aratnis, but 
Kat. gives the usual length at 3 or 4 aratnis and Ap. ( VII. 2. 
17) also quotes the Sat. Br. (XI. 7. 4. 1) that the yupa in nirudha- 
pasubandha is three or four aratnis in length, while in Soma 
sacrifices the other measures may apply. Kat. (VI. 1. 31) states 
that in somayaga the yupa may be from five to fifteen aratnis in 
length exoept 7, 10 or 14 aratnis and in the Vajapeya sacrifice 
the yupa is 17 aratnis in length and in the Asvamedha it is 21 
aratnis. According to Ap. it must be in length at least as much 
as the height of the yajamSna or as much as the yajamana with 
hands upraised. The girth of the yupa is not fixed. That part 
of the yupa which is to be planted in the pit is called upara, 
which is not to be chiselled and which is about a 5th of the 
whole log but the rest of it is to be chiselled from the bottom 
towards the top so as to make the yupa have eight angles and 
it should be somewhat tapering towards the top. One corner or 
angle ( out of the eight ) should be more prominent than the 
rest and should face the fire. Out of the top portion of the"" 
tree that remains after making the yupa the oarpenter prepares 
a wooden head-piece, eight-cornered and of the length of the 
hand from the wrist to the tips of the fingers and contracted in

the middle like a mortar. This pieoe Is called casUla and is 
made hollow so as to fit in exactly on to the top of the yQpa 
like a turban and the peg-like top of the yupa on whioh the 
cassia is fixed should protrude two or three angulas beyond the 
casSta ( Eat. VI. 1. 30 ). 

The nirudhapasubandha oocupies two days, though it may 
be performed in one day. On the first of the two days called 
upavasatha"* 1 preliminary matters such as preparing the vedi, 
bringing the yupa are performed. 

The vedi (a single one) in the nirudhapasubandha is 
prepared like the one in Varuna-praghasas to the east of the 
usual ahavanlya fire-place ( and not to the west as in darsa- 
purnam&sa ). The dimensions of the vedi are variously given. 
According to S.p. VII. 3. 7-9 the vedi is three or four aratnis 
on its western side, six aratnis in length from west to east and 
three aratnis on the eastern side and it is less in breadth 
'towards the. east or it is as wide as the axle on the west, of the 
length of the shafts of a cart and to the east as wide as that 
portion of a yoke which is between the outer holes thereof. 
On this vedi an uttaravedi ( a high altar ) is measured with 
the samya mT ( yoke-pin ) on the eastern one-third of the vedi. 
From the northern oorner of the eastern side ( the shoulder ) 
of the vedi, a pit oalled catvala is measured one samyS square 
about one prakrama to its north ; it is dug with a spade taken 

with the mantra ' devasya tv5 Sdade ' ( Vaj. S. VI. 1 ) and 

it is silently dug as deep as the knee or three vitastis ( 36 angu- 
las). The Tai. fir. I. 5. 10 gives the latter measure. The 
catvala is in front of the utkara and a passage is left between 
the utkara and the catvala whioh is contiguous to the north 
side of the mahSvedi (vide Sat. Br. III. 5. 1. 34-30). The earth 
dug up is heaped on the uttaravedi thrioe utt with the mantra

2487. The yoke-pin (rfamyK) is of khadira wood and 32 aigulas long, 
baring at tbe end eight knobs each of one aigula. Its length is 
rarionsly given. According to the com. on Xp. 1. 15. 13 it is one arm in 
length or 32 angulas, while oom. on Kst. I. 3. 36 says it is one span in 
length. Its thicker part is oalled kumba. 

2488. Xp. VIL 4. 5 and VII. 6. 1t2 give tbe several mantras whioh 
accompany the various operations of preparing the uttaravedi and the 
nlbhi.

' a lioness art; thou ' ( Tai. 8. I. 2. 12. 2 ) and a fourth time 
silently and then is spread over the uttaravedi with 'uru pra- 

thasva prathatam* ( Tai. S. I. 2. 12. 2 ); he breaks up the 

olods with the samyS, invokes the earth dug up, sprinkles it, 
spreads gravel on the earth so dug up and spread, pours down 
the remainder of the water contained in the proksanl vessel to the 
north of the uttaravedi by means of a ohannel made with one 
stroke of the sphya and oements together the borders of the utta- 
ravedi ( with water and earth ). On the uttaravedi he makes a 
square hole ( called uUaranabhi ) a span in measure or measuring 
as much as a bull's or horse's hoof, invokes it and sprinkles it 
with water and the rest of the water is drained off to the south 
(as water was drained off to the north above). Then he covers the 
uttaravedi with twigs of udumbara or plaksa tree and waits, if 
the pasubandha is so performed as to extend over two days. 
In the morning next day he pours clarified butter in a stream 
on the uttaravedi from the south-east corner to the north-west 
oorner and from the south-west to the north-east oarrying a 
golden piece in suoh a way that the butter will fall on the 
gold. Then he places three ( pine ) paridhis ( enclosing sticks ) 
whioh are of karsmarya wood ( according to Ap. VII. 7. 7 ) 
round the nabhi in the west, south and north and puts down 
on the uttaravedi certain materials viz. bdellium, fragrant 
and appetising grass, bunch of white wool from between 
the horns of a ram (petva ). Having kindled idhma ( a bunch 
of samidhs) at the ahavanlya fire, he carries forward the kind- 
led sticks ( in a vessel ) 2 " 9 which is supported on a vessel 
oontaining gravel ( to prevent the soorohing of the hands ) to the 
uttaravedi and places them down on the nabhi over the bdellium 
and other things. This becomes the ahavanlya for all actions 
in the pasubandha and the original ahavanlya becomes the 
garhapatya.**' * 

He takes a spade with a mantra ( e. g. Vaj. S. VI. 1 ), draws 
to the east of the new ahavanlya an outline of the hole to 
be dug for inserting the yupa. He digs a pit so deep that when 
the yupa is erected therein its upara ( the lower unchisel- 
led portion ) will not be exposed to view and he throws 
out to the east of the pit the earth dug out. The pit is so 

2489. Tbe baked day vessel whioh is bold beneath the vessel in 
which fire is oarried is called upayamanl. Tbe vessel in whioh fire is

dug that it is partly within the vedi ( prepared for pasubandha ) 
and partly outside* 4 " (i.e. it is on the border). The yupa is 
laid down in front of the pit, with its top to the east, is washed 
with water and sprinkled over with water in whioh barley 
grains have been mixed, a separate mantra ( prthivyai tv& &o. 
as in V&j. S. V. 26 ) being recited when sprinkling the bottom, 
middle and top of the yupa. He places a handful of kusas and 
the first chip ( that was out off with the axe from the tree ) on 
the yupa which are both subsequently thrown into the hole, 
the ends of the kusas being towards the north and east ; and 
then places to the north of the top of the yupa the casftla. The 
rest of the water taken for sprinkling is poured into the hole 
for the yupa with ' Sundhantam lok&h pitrsadan&h ' (Vftj. S. VI. 
1, Tai. S. I. 3. 1. 1 ) in which there is a referenoe to the world of 
the pitrs. He silently makes an offering of clarified butter in 
the hole with the sruva ladle. Then the adhvaryu or yaja- 
mfina sits to the south of the yupa and anoints it with ordinary 
fijya ( over whioh no sarhskara has been performed ) by means 
of a chip from its top to its bottom including all its angles ( but 
excluding the upara). While the adhvaryu is doing this he issueB 
a direotion to the hotr priest to repeat a verse for the yupa that is 
being anointed"" and the hotr repeats ' anjanti tvam ' ( Rg. III. 
8. 1) and stops when he has repeated half of it (As v. III. 1. 8). 
Then the casala is anointed both inside and outside and placed 
on top of the yupa with a mantra ( Vaj. S. VI. 2, Tai. S. I. 2. 2. 
3). Then that angular part of the yupa whioh. is to face the 
fire together with the corresponding part of the upara is anoint- 
ed in a continuous stream and the adhvaryu touohes all round 
and holds with his hand that part of the yflpa over whioh a 
girdle would be plaoed later on. At the direotion of the 
adhvaryu the hotr priest repeats the verses Rg. IIL 8. 2-3, 1. 36. 
13-14 and IIL 8. 5 ( half ), while the yupa is being raised up. It 
is laid in the hole with a mantra ( V&j. S. VL 3, Tai. S. I. 3. 6. 1 
*ya te dhfimani) in suoh a way that its top will slant towards 
theahavanlya and its corner (whioh is more prominent than

the reBt) will face the ahavanlya fire. If there are eleven yupas 
in an animal sacrifice, then those prominent corners of all eleven 
yupas should face the ahavanlya. He fills from left to right 
the hole for the yapa with earth with ' brahmavanim tva ' ( Vaj. 
VI. 3, Tai. 8. I. 3. 6. 2 ). The adhvaryu then strokes the earth 
thrice with the staff of the maitrSvaruna so as to make the 
ground round about the yupa level with the rest of the ground 
with ' brahma drmha ksatram drmha' (ibid) and sprinkles it 
with ( ordinary ) water all round. Two girdles of darbha are 
prepared one with two strands and two vyamas ,m in length (for 
the viotim) and the other with three strands and three vyamas in 
length (for the yapa). The yajamSna touches the yupa and the 
adhvaryu makes him recite 'observe the exploits of Visnu' (Rg. I. 
22. 19, Vaj. S. VI. 4, Tai. S. 1. 3. 6. 2) and look at the head-piece with 
* that is the highest step of Visnu ' ( Rg. I. 22. 20, Vaj. S. VI. 
5 ). Ap. ( VII. 11. 3 ) says that he takes in his hand the girdle 
for the yupa with ' devasya tva savituh ' and rubs up the yupa 
with the hand having the girdle therein with Rg. I. 22. 19» 
Then he begins to encircle the yupa with the middle of the 
girdle at a spot which is of the same height as the navel 
of the sacrificer or in the middle of the yupa. He calls upon 
the hotr to repeat Rg. III. 8. 4 ( yuva suvasah ) when the yupa 
is being encircled with the girdle. The girdle is passed round 
the yupa in three coils from left to right. When he has 
finished doing it he repeats ' parivlr- asi * ( Vaj. S. VI. 6, Tai. 
S. I. 3. 6. 2 ). The two ends of the girdle are intertwined into 
one another and he inserts the tip of the girdle inside the 
loop at the other end. Ap. ( VII. 11. 6-10 ) says that the girdle 
may be pushed down or higher up from the place indicated 
above or the ends may be dealt with differently according as 
the yajamana desires rain or not or according as female or male 
progeny is desired for the yajamana. To the north of the 
corner of the yupa faoing the ahavanlya he inserts in the middle 
or last coil of the girdle or in all ooils of the girdle the 8varu. UH

and surrounding with a girdle ( parivyana or parivyayana ) are 
performed on the yupa only onoe and are not repeated at eaoh 
time an animal is saorifioed. The girdle is an anga of the yupa 
and not of the pasu, as otherwise as many girdles will he 
required for the yQpa as the number of victims to be saorifioed 
in a yaga ( vide Jai. IV. 4. 22-24 ). The svaru is connected 
as an ariga with the victim ( for anointing the victim with 
it ) and not with the ynpa ( Jai. IV. 4. 25-28 ). Vide Jai. IV. 
2. 1-6 also. 

The animal to be sacrificed is bathed with soented water, 
is led between the caivala and utkara and brought in front of 
the yupa to the east with the animal's face to the west. The 
animal is a he-goat ( chaga ) which must not have a broken 
horn and must not be devoid of an ear or eye or tooth or tail, 
must not be lame nor have only seven hoofs ( instead of eight, 
as each of the feet has two hoofs ). If the animal is defective 
in any one of these ways an expiatory offering of Sjya has to be 
made to Visnu or Agni- Visnu or SarasvatI or Brhaspati ( Ap. 
VII. 12. 3). Then follows Paiupakaram un which may be done in 
two days. He takes a darbha blade other than from those spread 
on the vedi with ' upavlr-asi ' ( Vaj. S. VI. 7 ) and touches the 
animal ( that stands faoing the west ) therewith with the verse 
'near the gods' (upa devan, Vaj. 8. VI. 7). Another way (according 
to Ap. VII. 12. 5-8 ) is: he takes two blades of kusa reoiting 
' ise tva ' ( Tai. S. 1. 1. 1. 1 ) and takes a branch of plaksa tree 
that has many leaves and twigs, that is not dry at the end and 
is not hollow and touches the victim with the blades and the 
branoh and repeats the two mantras ' upo devan-daivlr-visah 
and ' prajapater-jayamans ' ( Tai. S. I. 3. 7. 1 and IU. 1. 1. 4 ) 
and the words 'I assign thee, who are dear to Indra and Agni.""* 
Then he produces fire by churning from the oralis and offers homa 
in accordance with the prooedure of the Vaisvadeva-parva (vide 
above pp. 1093-94). Ap. (VII. 12. 11) says that upakarana may 
be done after the production of fire. He makes a loop of the

girdle whioh has two strands and which is two vyamas in 
length ; he twines the loop round the right fore-leg of the 
animal and then fastens tightly the girdle on the right horn 
with the mantra * rtasya tva* ( Vaj. 8. VI. 8, Tai. 8. 1. 3.8); 
and ties the rasana ( girdle) round the yupa towards its north 
with 'devasya tva' ( Vaj. S. VI. 9 or Tai. 8. I. 3. 8. 1 ). He 
sprinkles water over it with * adbhyas-tvausadhlbhyo ' ( Vaj. 
S. VI. 9 )• Then he makes the victim drink water ( by holding 
below its mouth the agnihotra-havanl filled with water ) for the 
last time with ' apam perurasi ' (Vaj S. VI. 10, Tai. 8.1. 3.8.1). 
Then he sprinkles water over the upper limbs and lower limbs 
( suoh as its heart and belly ) and over the whole of its body. 
Then he performs all the procedure of the darsa-purnamasa 
beginning from the direction to the hotr to repeat a verse when 
the fire is being kindled up to the prayUjas ( i. e. the samidhe- 
nls, pravara-varana by the hotr, devatahvana, agharas and 
pravaravarana by the adhvaryu ). 

The pasu is meant either for Indra-Agni or SQrya or 
Prajapati and one has to dedicate the viotim throughout one's 
life in every pasubandha to that deity which one ohooses at the 
first animal sacrifice ( Kat. VI. 3. 29-30 ). He anoints the 
victim with ajya from the juhu ladle on its forehead, its 
shoulders and its hind parts after the last aghara is offered 
( as in darsa-purnamfisa ) and before dhruva-samafijana ( lad- 
ling ajya in the dhruva ladle with the juhu thrice, once

bandha ( while in darsapurnamSsa they are only five and 
in cftturmasyas they are nine ). The method of offering 
these in pasubandha is as follows: the adhvaryu directs 
the maitravaruna to request the hotr to repeat the yfijya 
verses from the AprI hymns of the pray&ja offerings in 
succession. The praisas (directions to the hotr) that the 
maitravaruna utters are rather lengthy and henoe the text of 
only one is given below. un There are ten AprI hymns in the

Rgveda asoribed to ten different sages. They are : 1. 13 ( of 
Medhstithi Kftnva), I. 142 (of Dlrghatamas Auohathya, an 
Angirasa ), 1. 188 (of Agastya), II. 3 (of Grtsamada, a Saunaka), 
III. 4 (of Visvamitra), V. 4 (of Atri), VII. 2 ( of Vasls^ha ), 
IX 5 ( of KSsyapa ), X. 70 ( of Vadhryasva ), X 110 ( of Jama- 
dagni ). Out of these in Rg. 1. 13 and 1. 142 there are verees 
for both Tanunapat ( 2nd prayaja deity ) and Narfisarhsa ; while 
Rg. 1. 188, III. 4, IX 5 and X 110 have only Tanunapat (and no 
Narfisamsa ) and the rest have only Narfisarhsa ( and no Tanu- 
napat ). Acoording to Asv. III. 2. 5-7, persons of Sunaka and 
Vasistba gotras should repeat their own AprI hymn ( viz. II. 3 
and VII. 2 respectively ), persons of gotras other than these 
two should employ the Aprl hymn beginning with ' Samiddho 
adya* (acoording to the com. Rg. X. 110 and not! 188) or 
persons of anyone of the ten gotras may employ an Aprl hymn 84 " 

2499. The word 'Kprl' appears to be nsed in two senses. One 
sense is 'a deity or deities' invoked by the verses of the hymn. Yffska 
(in the Nirukta VIII. 4-22) holds a lengthy discussion on the Aprfs, where 
he appears to regard the April as deities ; amnr wrftvt > wrft?: »,w r q, I 
•irwfHh jfirrifan i witfrBJTt'ff'Trcfrfit it wrgrTt • *rraifrwt srowrrnft *tnft • 
(Nir. VIII. 4). The 2nd meaning of Aprl ia 'a verse (ysjys) that 
gratifies a deity '. In this sense the word is nsed in the Ait. Br. VI. 4 
' sTpftrotTifWrrft i wPfcJr Thrift i ■•• a^jrnw T^rfsf i *nntftf laift • jsst Tariff

arrrfWrft qammH a: irs^sgHprr ^pn% i '. In this passage the explana- 
tions of flf^tfr trsrftt and others have been omitted. The word Aprl is 
here derived from the root 'pri ' to please, while YSska also suggests an 
alternative derivation from ' Sp ' to obtain but oltea no BrKhmana 
text in support of that derivation. The Sat. Br. III. 8. 1. 2 derives 
• Aprl ' f rom • pr ' to fill. Aocording to YSska the first Aprl deity is 
' Id hum ', while aocording to the Ait. Br. it is ' Samidhah '. It is to be 
noted that he* explains all the verses of $g. X. 110, as the Aprl hymn 
but as that hymn does not oontain a verse about Narl&aihsa he quotes 
one from another Apr! hymn a verse for him viz. Eg. VII. 2. 2 (in Nir. 
VIII. 7). Hence it is probable that he held the view that the Aprl 
verses for all persona should be taken from Rg. X. 110, while the Ait. 
Br. prefers the view that one should repeat that Aprl hymn that is 
ascribed to the founder of one's gotra. Ysska (Nir. VIII. 22) divides 
the Aprl hymns into three olassea, those containing veraei addressed to 
both Tanunapat and NarSaarhsa, those addressed to NarKsamsa only and 

( Continutd on ntmt foge ) 



Oh. XXXII ] Paiubandha-lpris 1119 

ascribed to the founder of his gotra if he is from among these 
ten sages. The words of Asv. L 5. 21-22 oreate some difficulty. 
Asv. there prescribes that when uttering the ysjya" at the time 
of offering the 2nd prayaja, the formula should contain an 
address to Tanunapat for all except for persons of Vasisfba, 
Sunaka, Atri, Vadhryasva and Rajanya gotras. These latter 
should utter a formula addressed to Narasamsa. Here if 
• rajanya ' refers to Visvaraitra, then the difficulty is that in the 
Aprl hymn (III. 4) ascribed to him, the 2nd deity is Tanunapat 
and not Narasamsa ; but it is possible tbat the word ' rajanya ' 
stands for a ksatriya sacrifioer in general and does not refer to 
Visvamitra gotra at all. After ten prayajas are offered, the 
adhvaryu says to the slaughterer of the viotim ' bring your 
two-edged knife.' The adhvaryu takes the svaru (chip of wood) 
and anoints the svaru and one edge of the knife with the clari- 
fied butter from the bill-like ( or spout-like ) part of the juhu 
ladle ( according to Ap. VII. 14. 10 the svaru is anointed thrice ) 
and holding the svaru below the knife touches with both the 
head of the viotim (forehead, according to Est. VI. 5. 12 ) with a 
mantra(Vaj.S.VI.ll,Tai.S.L3.8.1). After placing back the 
svaru whence it was taken the adhvaryu gives the knife baok 
to the slaughterer (samitr) with the words 'let this edge be marked 
by you ' ( Sat. Br. III. 8. 1. 5 ). The animal when killed is out up 
by the slaughterer with the un-anointed edge and the flesh when 
roasted is cut up with the edge that is anointed. The adhvaryu 
directs the maitravaruna to recite a mantra for indicating that 
fire ( a fire-brand ) is being oarried round the viotim and the 
maitravaruna reoites ' agnirhota no ' ( Rg. IV. 15. 1 ) or the 
verses Rg. IV. 15. 1-3 (according to Asv. IIL 2. 9). To the north 
of the catvala pit, he digs up a spot for establishing the

those addressed to TanQnapIt only. He mentions an 11th Apr! hymn 
occurring in the praisa ( i. e. probably the prais&dhyaya Aprl hymn). 
There are Apr! hymns in the other yedas also. For example, vide V*j. 
8. 21. lt-2x (only TanUnapSt ), 29. 85-36 ( containing addresses to both 
TanQnapIt and NarSaamsa and being the tame as %. X. 110 ezoept the 
verse to NarSiamsa which is taken from ?g. VII. 3. 2), Atharvareda V. 
12 ( same as ?g. X. 110 ), V. 27. The Tai. Br. III. 6. 3 contains all the 
Aprl verses of 9g. X. 110 and the verse %. VII. 3. 2. There is 
considerable literature on the Aprls, both anoient and modern. Vide 
Tai. 8. IV. 1. 8, Tai. Br. II. 6. 12 and 18 and Ait. Br. (Hang's tr. pp.

1120 History of Dharmaiastra { Oh. XXXII 

SSmitra fira M0 ° The Sgnldhra, lighting a fire-hrand at the 
Shavanlya, carries it thrice round the victim, the yupa, the 
Shavanlya fire, the plaoe where the samitra fire is to be kindledi 
the oStvSla pit and the clarified * m butter, from left to right 
with the mantra 'pari vajapatih kavih* ( Rg. IV. 15. 3, Tai. 
8. IV. 1. 2. 5 ). In modern times the priest perambulates all 
these together and not separately. The Sgnldhra throws the 
firebrand on to the Shavanlya fire and again goes round the 
above objects thrice from right to left. According to Ap. 
VII. 15. 4-6, the adhvaryu makes one, two, three or four offer- 
ings of ajya, with mantras called apavya, when fire is carried 
round the victim, when it is set free from the yupa and led 
on ( Tai. S. III. 1. 4. 1-2 ). The Sgnldhra, again taking up the 
same fire-brand, starts to go with his face to the north and the 
victim is led after the agnldhra by the samitr ( who takes 
away the cord of girdle from the victim's head and ties it round 
its neck ). The pratiprasthStr ( an assistant of adhvaryu ) 
touches the animal ( that is being led northward ) from behind 
with two utensils ( spits ) made of karsmarya wood ( used for 
roasting vapft, omentum ), the adhvaryu touches the pratipra- 
sthStr and the sacrificer touohes the adhvaryu. 8 * 08 A pit is got 
dug ( by a servant ) for covering in it the undigested food and 
the foaoes of the viotim when killed. They ( the priests and 
yajamSna ) should not pass beyond the plaoe for the sSmitra 
fire. The adhvaryu takes two kusa blades from those with 
whioh the vedi is strewn and says to Sgnldhra ' 03srS3vaya ' 

2500. The fire on which the flesh of the viotim is roasted is oalled 
Sinatra. The burning fire-brand, after it is carried round the victim, is 
plaoed by the adhvaryu ( who takes it from the Sgnldhra's hand ) on a 
spot to the north of the oBtvBla and that becomes the dlmitra fire,

to some the s'Smitra fire is specially produced by attrition ( vide Kit. 

VI. 5. 14). 

2501. There are several views here. Some hold that the fire-brand 
s to be carried round the viotim alone, others hold that it is to be 
carried round the first five objects and others add Vjya ; others that the 
fire-brand is carried round the victim, the place of sgmitra and Sjya. 
Vide Est. VI. 5. 2-3, Ap. VII. 15. 2 and com, thereon. This operation 
•f oarrying fire round the viotim is called paryagnikaraoa. Aooording 
to the Tai. Br. III. 8. 17 the mantras ' mesas-tvK pacatair-avatu ' are 
apEvya and that the PrBnas are apSvya (the mantras are Tai. S. 

VII. 4. 12. 1 ). 

2502. The idea of this touohrng seems to be that some spiritual 
influenoe passes from the consecrated >|ctim to the sacrificer.

and the latter replies ' asfcu srau3sat ' and then the adhvaryu 
issues an upapraisa ( a supplementary direotion ) to the mai- 
tr&varuna to prompt ( the hotr ) to reoite for the offerings to 
Gods.' 50 * The hotr then recites the famous ( but long ) adhrigu-

explains how changes ( aha ) are to be effected in this formula in 
different rites according to the limbs ooncerned, the deities and the 
number of victims. 5iv. ( III. 3. 2 and 4 ) provides that the words 
wfifcrTO, 3JTTT and W^TT Wt «^t"5 nre recited inaudibly and the 

passage ' smfrifr 3TO17 ' is repeated thrice. This whole formula is 

called adhrigu and adhrigu was also supposed to be a deity presiding 
over the slaughtering of a victim in sacrifice. Vide com. on Sir. 
III. 2. 11. There were as remarked by Sffn. Sr. nine pauses to take 
breath at the end of each of the first nine sentences. The Nirukta 
(V. 11 ) explains ' adhrigu ' as meaning a mantra and also states that 
the word is applied to Agni in Bg. III. 21. 4 and to Indra in Bg. 

I. 61. 1. The Nirukta quotes the words ' stffrft sjiftrf sifiJnt." 

Jaimini oonsiders questions arising from some of the words used in this 
formula; in IX. 8. 27-28 (when there are many viotims in a sacrifice, 
the singular 'oaksur' is still to be used), IX. 3. 29-31 (the word 
' ekadjrt ' is explained ), IX. 3. 32-40 ( some sSkhSs read ' medhapataye ' 
and some 'medhapatibhySm ' and the word means 'devata*'), 
IX. 4. 1-16 ( about ' 26 ribs ' when there are two or more viotims ), 
IX. 4. 22 ( « urQka ' means * vapB ' ), IX. 4. 23-24 ( ' prasasS ' means 'pm- 
eastau ' ), IX. 4. 25-27 (the words 'syena, dais, kasyapa, kavasa and 
srekaparna only mean that the limbs are to be taken out entire and 
when so taken out they resemble the hawk and other objects mentioned. 
Jai. ( IX. 1. 45-49 ) says that in the AtirBtra sacrifice of the ewe to 
Barasvatl the adhrigupraif a does not occur. Different views were enter- 
tained as to who the samitr was, the usual opinion being that he was a,

terere calling upon them to bring the animal to the holy 
doors of the saorifioial plaoe, wishing that the parents, relatives 
and friends of the victim will consent to its death and expres- 
sing the hope that its several organs and limbs, suoh as the 
eyes and ears, will be merged in divinities like the sun and 
giving directions as to how its parts are to be cut and disposed 
of. On reoiting this solemn formula the hotr, while still 
occupying his seat, turns to the right (i. e. he comes to 
face the west) and has the saorifioial place behind his back and 
the maitr&varupa does the same. The adhvaryu throws one of 
the two blades taken up by him to the west of the samitra fire, 
the viotim is held over that blade with its head to the west (or 
to the east, according to Kat. VI. 5. 17 ) and feet to the north. 
Then its mouth is firmly held so as to stop its breathing and 
choke it to death or it is strangled to death without allowing it 
to give out a cry, by using a halter round its throat. The 
adhvaryu says ' kill it without SMS allowing it to utter a ory ' 
and then he along with the pratiprasthatr, agnldhra and the 
sacrifioer come back to the ahavanlya which they face, turn 
from left to right and remain with their backs to the animal 
that is being killed ( i. e. they, do not see the actual slaying of 
the animal ). According to Ap. VII. 16. 7 the sacrifioer repeats 
.at this time several verses such as Tai. S. III. 3. 1. 2, Tai. Br. 
III. 7. 7, the purport of which is that the viotim may go to heaven, 
the sacrifioer himself also may go to heaven after securing 
welfare in this world. When the samitr deolares that the victim 
is killed the adhvaryu says 'let.it lie down for a moment. ' If 
the pasu bleats while being strangled the adhvaryu then offers 

( Continued from last page ) 

person other than the rlviks ( though s few opined that one of the rtvikg 
who choked or strangled the animal waa called flamitr). Vide Est. 
VI. 7. 1-4 and' the com. thereon. According to Jai. III. 7. 28-29, s'amitr 
is the adhvaryu himself, asv. XII. 9. 12.-13 shows that the aamiti may 
be a brSbmana or a non-brahman*. The Ait. Br. VI. 7 and A9>. III. 3. 4 
state that the hotr is to utter inaudibty '0 ( divine ) slaughterers 1 
whatever merit exists in this male that belong to us, whatever is sin- 
ful, make it go elsewhere ', The words sjfaarro, sriJnnSg', item are called 
srftrrws ( stops or pauses ). The last is pronounoed as stum. 

2605. According to Kst. VI. 5. 21 the adhvaryu only says * kill it 
(the padu), it has gone following (the gods) ' ; sjymiHnft l riH fTOC* 
The com. on Ap. VII. 16. 5. explains ' snfr/l^r *nvt #qrawi; ' ( it is killing

ajya in fire ( as an expiation ). The sacrifioer and adhvaryu 
with vapasrapanls ( spits ) approach the dead victim with the 
words ' O slaughterers, may you approaoh ' ( Tai. S. III. 1. 4. 3 ). 
He then removes the cord ( by which the victim was tied ) with 
'may Adtti remove this cord* (Tai. S. III. 1, 4. 2). He winds 
round the rasana ( girdle of the victim ) into a loop, keeps it 
on the arteries of the victim leading to the ears, attaches it to a 
peg and throws it into the c&tvfila pit (Ap. VII. 17. 4-6). Accord- 
ing to Kat. VI. 5. 26 he throws the tying oord into the catvcLla 
by means of the two vapasrapanls. Then the adhvaryu directs 
the pratiprasthatr to lead forward the saorificer's wife from her 
seat to the vedi. When leading her who has a jar of water in 
her hands for washing the feet and other limbs of the paau, the 
priest* 508 makes her reoite a verse in honour of the sun ' namas- 
te atftna ' ( Vaj. S. VI. 12, Tai. S. I 3. 8. 2 ). Ap. adds that the 
wife, priests and the sacrifioer touoh water on the catvala pit 
( VII. 18. 4 ) with a mantra ( Tai. S. I. 3, 8. 2 ' apo devlh ). The 
wife sitting down near the dead pasu washes with water the 
several parts of the victim's body viz. its mouth, nose, eyes, 
navel, penis, anus, feet ( all together ) with appropriate formulae 
in eaoh case ( viz. ' vacam te sundhami" &c. Vaj. S. VI. 14). 
With the water remaining in the jar the adhvaryu and sacrifioer 
sprinkle the other parts, such as the head, with Vaj. VI. 15 (Tai. 
S. I- 3. 9. 1 ). The adhvaryu turns the animal on its back and 
plaoes on the victim's body a blade of kusa with its end to the 
east about four fingers* 507 below the navel of the animal with 
' osadhe trByasva ' ( Vaj. S. VI. 15 ), plaoes the marked edge of 
the knife on that blade, makes a slit on the kusa blade and the 
belly obliquely, takes in his left hand the portion of the blade 
cut off and anoints the ends of the other portion of the 
blade with blood ( that spirts out from the slit ) with ' thou 
art the portion of evil spirits ' ( Vaj. VI. 16 ), touches water 
and throws that blood-stained blade on the utkara.' 508 The 

8506. Est. ( VI. 6. 28 ) Bays that where an animal is sacrificed in 
a Soma.saorifioe (as the agnisomtya pasu or aavanlya pain in Agni- 
efoma ) it is the nestr who leads forward the wife. If the sacrifioer has 
several wives they all are led and all repeat the formula ( Vsjj. VI. 12 ), 
but, only one carries the water jar. 

2507. The vapS ( omentum ) of the ]>aau is about four fingers below 
the navel.

ssorifioer treads" ' upon the blood-stained blade with the left 
foot ( and then touches water with his hand ). The adhvaryu 
then pulls out from the belly of the victim the omentum* 
envelopes the two spits ,sw ( vapSsrapanls ) with it, pierces 
the thin end of the vapS with one spit, severs it from the 
belly on all sides and sprinkles it with water holding the 
spits over the oStvala pit. Then the pratiprasthstr heats 
the omentum on the sSmitra fire. The adhvaryu, pratipras- 
thstr and Sgnldhra come from the o&tvSla to the Shavanlya. 
The Sgnldhra throws the sSmitra fire (viz. the firebrand 
and not the fire produced by attrition ) into the Shavanlya and 
the adhvaryu also throws into it the portion of the blade held 
in his left hand ( as stated at p. 1123 above ). A.p. ( VII. 19. 3 ) 
adds that the samitr holds tightly by the olosed fingers of his 
hands the two portions of the skin of the victim's belly till the 
omentum is offered into fire. The pratiprasthstr, standing to 
the north of the Shavanlya fire, heats the omentum on that fire, 
then carries it by the space between the yupa and Shavanlya, 
goes round to the south side, and roasts the omentum on the 
Shavanlya. The adhvaryu takes clarified butter in the sruva 
ladle and pours Sjya on the omentum that is being held for 
roasting on the Shavanlya by the pratiprasthstr with a mantra. 
"When drops (stokas) of fat begin to drip from the omentum, 
the adhvaryu direots the maitrSvaruna to reoite for the drops. 
The maitrSvaruna recites $g. I. 75. 1 and Rg. HI. 21- 1-5. M " 
When the omentum is well roasted, the pratiprasthstr says to 
the adhvaryu ' it is roasted, proceed.' Tbe omentum is plaoed 
on the south corner of the western side ( sroni ) of the vedi on 
a branoh of plaksa tree stretched on the barhis ( kusa grass on 
the vedi ). Then the hotr recites the mantra for srugSd&pana 
( making the adhvaryu take up the juhu and upabhrt ladles ) 
and the adhvaryu issues a direction M,a to the maitrSvaruna

priest to ask the hotr to reoite the last AprI verse as the yajyS 
for the 11th prayaja ( which had remained to be recited ). 
Having offered ajya ( the 11th prayaja ) into fire and having 
offered the two ajyabhSgas (acoording to Jai. X. 8. 5 and 
some others the ajyabhagaa are not offered in independent 
animal saorifioes nor in the animal sacrifice ih* soma-y5ga» 
Ap. VII. 20. 8 ) he puts ajya in the juhii ladle, places a piece 
of gold thereon, then the whole omentum on that piece ( taking 
it from the spits ), places another golden piece oh the omentum, 
on which he pours ajya. 8,,s The adhvaryu then offers into the 
ahavanlya the omentum so treated to Indra and 'Agni ( or 
SQrya or Pgjijapati as stated above on p. 1117 ). The anuvftkyft 
and yajyaf of the vapa are respectively Rg. I. 93. 1 and 5. 
Acoording to Asv. III. 4. 4. the pradanas ( yagas ) in all pasu- 
bandhas are three, viz. vapa, purodasa and havis. After offering 
vapa, the adhvaryu throws, while standing to the north, into 
the ahavanlya the vapSsrapanl spits, the one with two forks 
having the forks in the east and the other having its point 
turned to the west ( according to Ap. VII. 21. 3 it is the prati- 
prasthatr who does this ). The adhvaryu offers on the spits 
the saAisrava ( the drippings ). Ap. ( VII. 21. 5 ) and some other 
sutras prescribe that the fee of one bull and three milch oows 
or three other cows is given to the priests at this stage. The 
priests ( six ), the sacrificer and his wife go out to the catvala 
and there purify themselves by "marjana ( purifying with drops 
of water ) with ' idamapah pravahata,' 8SU Vaj. S. VI. 17 and 
Bg. X 9. 8 ( while Ap. VIL 21. 6 prescribes five, viz. the three 
* apo hi stha ' Rg. X 9. 1-3, * idamapah ' ftg. I. 23; 22, ' nirmft 
muficami' Rg.X.97.16 = Vaj. S. XII. 90). When doing this 
the maitravaruna lays down his staff ( Asv. Ill 5. 1 ). 

Now preparations are to be made for the pasu-purodasa 81 "* 
and the necessary utensils are placed to the east of the ahava- 
nlya (the former ahavanlya i. e. the gftrhapatya in this sacrifice) 
on ktisa grass by the agnldhra. The devata of the purodasa is 

the same as the devata of the victim i. e. Indra and Agni ( vide

p. 1117 above ). Jai. ( XII. 1. 1-6 ) prescribes that the proce- 
dure ( viz. prayajas ) performed at the time of offering vapft is 
not to be repeated when the pasupurodasa ia offered. The 
adhvaryu separates the various organs ( such as the heart, the 
tongue ) from the corpse without cutting into parts each organ 
( according to the com. on Ap. VII. 22. 5 and 7 it is the samitr 
who outs up the several limbs ). There is some divergence as 
to the limbs of the victim that are out off and are used as 
avadanas and since animal sacrifices became rare or were 
altogether stopped in medieval times, the commentators do not 
explain all the words used in the ancient texts in the same way 
(vide Ap. VII. 22. 6, Kat. VI. 7. 6-12 and Baud. IV. 8). Accord- 
ing to Ap. VII. 22. 6, u " the limbs out off are : the heart, the 
tongue, chest, the liver, the kidneys ( vrkyau, vrkkau in Eat. ), 
left forefoot, the two flanks ( parsve ), the right haunch, a third 
part ( i. e. the middle one) of the entrails — these are meant 
for the devatas and are to be offered with the juhu ladle ; 
the right fore-foot, the left haunch, the thinnest third of 
the entrails— these are for svistakrt ; the kloman ( the 
right lung t J" IT , pllhan ( the spleen ), purltat ( pericardium ? ), 
adhyudhnl ( a tubular vessel above the udder ), vanis^hu 
( large entrails ? ), medas ( fat ), jaghanl"" ( the tail ). Kat. VI. 

2616. According to Kat. VI. 7. 6 it is the foremost ( or upper ) joint 
( parvanadaka ) of the left forefoot ( that ia taken ) among the first 
nine. Est. VI. 7. 6. describes the first nine as jauhavam ( to be offered 
with the juhn ) and the next three as connected with upabhrt ladle. 
The three cut into upabhit are called tryahga and are meant for 
STifjukrt. Vide Sat. Br. III. 8. 3. 18 (S. B. B. Vol. 26 p. 205). The 
whole of the entrails are taken off at once and divided only at the time 
of cutting and putting into the juhn ladle. 

2517. According to com. on Est. kloman is trarrfaqiT, while com. 
on Ap. says it is a fleshy gland called 'tilaka' resembling the liver. 
Purltat is perioardium according to com. on Est. and entrails (antra) 
according to com. on Ap. Medas acoording to com. on Ap. is the mem- 
brane covering the heart and the vrkya. 

2518. Vide Jaimini III. 8, 20-23 about jSghani and patntsamySja 
and com. on Est. VI. 7. 10 for the various meanings attributed to 
jSghani. Jaimini has several gutras on pasu. In X. 7. 1-2 he establishes 
that the whole animal is not one offering, but that its several limbs are 
separate offerings. In X. 7. 3-9 he establishes that only eleven organs 
(heart &c.) are fit to be offered, that the shoulders , head, anflka and sakthi n 
are altogether prohibited ; in X. 7. 10-11 he declares that the three 
a&gai, viz. the front portion of the forefoot, the middle of the entrails, 
and the sroni are offered to Sviftakrt; in X. 7. 12-17 he dealt with, the 
adhyudhnl given to hotr and vanisfhu to Sgnidhra.

7. 11 adds that kloman and the next three may be out off or 
nob The medas ( fat on the abdomen ) is, aooording to Est., 
thrown on the guda (entrails) if the victim be thin. The 
tail is to be employed as an offering in the PatnlsamySja, 
according to Eat. and the largest part of the intestines ( 3rd of 
the whole ) was to be employed as offering in upayaj homo. 
The undigested grass ( inside the belly of the viotim ) is put 
in a pit dug up to the west of the samifera fire and to the north 
of the utkara and on it the blood of the viotim is poured with 
the words 'thou art the portion of evil spirits' ( Vaj. S. VL 16 ). 
The victim's heart is held pierced on a pike ( aula ) made of 
varana wood one aratni long and is roasted on the samitra 
fire and all other parts of the victim except the heart are cooked 
in an ukha ( pot for boiling or cooking ). According to com. 
on Ap. VII. 22. 9 this cooking is done by the samitr. Jai. XII. 

1. 12 prescribes that the cooking is done on the salfimukhlya 
fire and not on samitra fire. The adhvaryu performs the 
operation of sprinkling butter on the juhu and upabhrt, outs two 
portions from the middle and front parts of the cooked material 
into the juhu, pours butter over it and offers it into fire for 
Indra and Agni, then cuts one portion ( for Svistakrt ) into the 
upabhrt, makes two pourings of butter over it and makes an 
offering to Agni Svis^akrt. M, » Jai. ( XII. 1. 10-11 ) concludes 
that the offering of the pasupurodasa is made with the ladles 
used in darsapurnamasa and not with the soma vessels ( viz, 
the oups and oamasas ). Then a portion is cut off out of the 
remainder of the material from whioh purodasa was offered 
and placed in a vessel called prasitraharana ( which portion 
of the saorifioial food is eaten by the brahma priest ) and some 
portion is cut off as the ids, whioh is invoked with mantras 
and eaten by all the priests. He then thrioe asks the samitr 
whether the havis ( the heart roasted on a pike ) is ready 
oooked and the latter simply replies ' it is cooked '. Est. 
VI. 8. 1 prescribes that the samitr should in his reply 
utter only the word ' srtam ' and should not add any word 
like 'revered sir' (bhagavah) or 'hi*. The samitr then

takes off the heart from the pike ( sllla ) on which it was roas- 
ted, and keeps it in a pot ( kumbhl ) and pours over it prsadajya 
( clarified butter in which sour milk is mixed ) with ' aan te ' 
( V«j. S. VI. 18, Tai. 8. L 3. 10. 1 ) and ajya over the other 
portions of the pasu. The samitr gives the hrdaya-sula ( the 
pike on which the heart was roasted ) to the adhvaryu who does 
not keep it on the bare ground nor throw it in water, nor does 
he touch with it' himself or others ( but holds it tied by a oord ). 
He takes these ( viz. the roasted heart and the cooked organs ) 
between the yupa and the ahavanlya fire and places them on 
the southern part of the altar ( viz. its southern corner, of the 
western side ) over which kusa grass is already spread. Then 
ajya is sprinkled over four utensils viz. juhu, upabhrt, vasa. 
homahavani ( a sruc ladle with which the offering of vasa i. e. 
of the gravy is to be made ) and the vessel in which ida is to 
be out. Then a golden piece is plaoed in the juhu and the 
upabhrt, which are then kept on twigs of plaksa tree and then 
in the juhu and upabhrt are cut by the pratiprasthatr ( with the 
anointed edge of the knife ) portions of the heart, then of the 
tongue and then of the chest (this order is stated in the. Tai. 
S. VL 3. 10 ) and then of the other limbs in any order 
(the whole of the entrails being at this stage cut in 
three parts). Two portions of the size of the fore-part of 
the thumb are out both in the juhu ( of the daivata limbs ) 
and upabhrt ( of the limbs meant for Svistakrt ). While this 
is being done the adhvaryu directs the maitravaruna to 
repeat texts for the ham that is to be offered to Manota 
and the maitravaruna repeats the whole hymn Rg. VI. 1 ( in 
the first of whioh only the word Manota occurs as an epithet 
of Agni, probably meaning ' thinker ' ). He takes the gravy in 
the vascLhomahavayP" with 4 red-asi ' ( V&j. S. VL 18 ), pours 
ajya over it twice and mixes the two together with the knife. 
The rest of the vasa he pours in the idapatra to whioh are 



2520. Vide Sat. Br. III. 8. 3. 14 (S. B. E. vol.. 26 p. 203 where 
Manota" is of the feminine gender) and Ait. Br. VI. 10; the latter refers to 
9g. VI. 1. 1-13 and says Vsk, Go and Agni are the three ManotSs. The 
hymn alio is called Manota" (vide Asv. III. 4. 6 and com.). The manotl- 
mantra is the same, though tbe animal may be offered in some sacrifices 
to other deities. Vide Jai. X. 4. 42. 



Oh. XXXII ] Paiubandha 1129 

added the chest and other boneless parts." 81 When the yajyft 
for Indra-Agni is half repeated, a part of the vasa is offered 
by the pratiprasthatr sitting to the north into fire with ' ghrtam 
ghrtapSvBnah ' ( Vaj. S. VI. 19, Tai. S. I. 3. 10. 2 ) and with 
the remainder of the vas8 he makes offerings in each direction 
with'disah pradisah * ( Vaj. S. VI. 19, Tai. S. L 3.10.2). 
No vasa is kept for being partaken of by the priests ( com. on 
Kat. VI. 8. 22 ). Then the adhvaryu takes in the juhu a part 
of prsadajya ( mottled butter ) from the pot of prsadajya and 
offers to Vanaspati and after taking the contents of the upa- 
bhrt into the juhu makes the offering to Svistakrt ( Ap. VII. 
25. 14 and Kat. VI. 8. 18-22 state that the order of these last 
offerings may be different ). Then he touches the remaining 
organs and limbs of the pasu and keeps the juhu and upabhrt 
in their places. Then the ids ( to be eaten by the priests ) 
is brought between the yupa and the ahavanlya fire. After 
the Ida is invoked the six priests and the sacrifioer partake 
of it, but there are special portions assigned to eaoh viz. the 
▼anisjhu is given to the Sgnldhra, the adhyudhnl to the hotr 
and the oheBt to brahma. Then they all purify themselves by 
marjana. The adhvaryu then directs the agnldhra 'bring 
burning coals for upayaj offerings', directs the pratiprasthatr 
( called upayasfr 8IM here ) to attend to the coals; to the brahmS 

2521. The whole animal is the sacrificial material ( just as rice- 
grains are the material from which caru is prepared for offering ) and 
havi$ is constituted by the heart and other organs of the animal. Vide 
com. on Est. VI. 8. 6 and Jai. X. 7. 1-2. The several organs and parts 
are taken out of the ukhs and spread over a large bamboo vessel 
( vamda-pStrT ), the last part being placed in the north. The adhvaryu 
performs on eaoh of the eleven limbs (called jauhava ) prGnaduna 
( vivifioation ) while no prBpadgna is done for the portions to be offered 
to Svisfakrt. According to Ap. VII. 24. 5 only one portion is cnt from 
the limbs meant for Svisfakrt. Several rules are laid down in Ap. VII. 
24. 6-12 about the outting of some parts. Out of the three parts of the 
entrails, one of medium thickness is out in two and placed among the 
daivata portions, the thinnest part being for svistakrt; the medas is out in 
three parts, two being put in the two sruos and the third intbeidSpStra. 
The medal is mixed in the broth of the victim's limbs. The ids is made 
from the first six out of the limbs ( heart &o. ) and the vanisj.hu is the 
7th. The ids is increased by the addition of the limbs that have no 
bones viz. kloman, spleen and purrtat. 

2522. According to com. on Ap. VII. 26. 8 the hotr is the upayasfc. 
According to Jai XII. 4. 8 this offering of the entrails is a samskKra 
( pratipattikarma ) and when many viotims are sacrificed in one rite, the 
entrails of all animals are offered as upaysja offerings.

priest he says ' shall I start ' and also direots the agnldhra to 
plaoe a samidh on the fire. The agnldhra brings red-hot ooals 
from the samitra fire, and puts them down on the northern 
corner of the west side of the altar after removing the kusas 
strewn thereon ( in soma the coals may be optionally brought 
from the agnldhrlya fire-place and placed on hotr dhisnya ). 
The third and thickest part of the entrails ( that has been kept 
aside ) is cut obliquely into eleven parts, whioh are offered 
into the red-hot coals plaoed as above by the pratiprasthatr 
with his right hand, each with a mantra ( for eleven mantras 
vide Vaj. S. VI. 21, Tai. S. I. 3. 11. 1 ), when the cry vauaat 
Is uttered for eaoh of the eleven anuyajas tm that are offered 
with prsadajya here ( Ap. VII. 26. 12 ). These eleven offerings 
of the entrails are called upayajas (additional offerings), vide 
Jai. XII. 4. 8. At the end of the 11th offering, the pratipras- 
thatr touches his mouth and the portion sticking to his hand is 
wiped on the barhis with the words ' adbhyastvausadhlbhyah ' 
(Tai. S. 1. 3. 11). At the end of the anuyajas, the svaru is plaoed 
in the juhu ladle and offered into fire with 'may thy smoke reaoh 
the sky, may thy flame reaoh heaven, fill the earth with thy 
ashes, svaha ! • (Vaj. S. VI. 21, Ap. VII. 27. 4). Ap. (VII. 27. 6-7) and 
others say the direction ( praisa ) for repeating the suktavaka is 
uttered by the maitravaruna'"* (and not by the adhvaryu). The 
hotr repeats it and the maitravaruna throws his staff into the 
ahavanlya fire ( Asv. III. 6. 21 ) and Ap. ( VII. 27. 8 ) says that 
the three paridhis also are thrown into fire by means of the 
sruos except the dhruva. The patnlsarhyaja is performed with 
the tail of the animal, which is taken to the south of the sacri- 
ficial ground. There was a difference of opinion whether 
portions of the tail were offered to all the four deities of patnl- 
samyaja MM or to some only ( vide Kat. VI. 9. 14-20 ). Aooor- 
ding to Ap. ( VIL 27. 10 ) and Kat. ( VI. 9. 15-19 ) only ajya 
offerings are made to Soma and Tvastr, the inside part of the 
tail ( on which no hair grow ) is cut up for the wives of the 
gods and the hairy part is cut up for Agni Grhapati. Whether

the saorifioer is caturavattin or paflcavattin, all four or five por- 
tions are out off from the tail and there is no under layer 
( upastarana ) and upper layer ( abhigh&rana ) of ajya in this 
case. According to Kat. VI. 9. 20 portions of the tail are 
offered to all devatfis of patnlsamyaja. Vide Jai. XII. 4. 10-16 
and III. 3. 20-23 on this. Ida is cut from the hairless portion of 
the tail for hotr and from the hairy portion for the fignldhra and 
the rest of the tail is handed over to the saorificer's wife who 
passes it on to the adhvaryu or some brahmana. The samifcr 
had so far partaken of nothing, but he is now given the 
shoulder of the victim, but if he be not a brahmana he gives 
it to a brahmana. They offer three samistayajus, tm throw 
the barhis into fire, approach a pond ( or reservoir of water ) 
taking with them the spit ( sula ) on whioh the heart was 
roasted. Up. VII. 27. 15 says that they carry 81 the sula in such 
a way as not to touoh it. The adhvaryu enters in the midst 
of the water and conceals the spit into the bottom underneath 
with its tip downwards with the mantra 'thou art sorrow ; give 
him sorrow who hateth us and whom we hate ' ( Tai. S. I. 3. 11« 
1-2 and also with V&j. S. VI. 22 according to Kat. VI. 10. 3 ), 
at the same time thinking of his enemy ( without taking his 
name ). If he does not enter water, then he may pour some 
water to the east of the yupa and should conceal the spit at the 
place where the dry spaoe and wet space meet. Asv. ( III. 6. 
25-26 ) prescribes that all the priests, the saorificer and the 
wife do not touch the sula after it is thrust into the earth, do 
not look at it, and return, each taking one after another three 
fuel-sticks with a mantra for each and put them on fire with a 
mantra for eaoh stick one after another, after doing homage to 
the ahavanlya with Rg. I. 23. 23. Then they all perform 
marjana near the concealed sula or the catvala with ' sumi- 
triya na &pa osadhayah ' ( Tai S. I. 4. 45. 2 ) or according to 

Kat. VI. 10. 5 they touch water with ' dhamno sumitriyS 

naspah' (V&j. S. VI. 22 ). Then they pray Varuna to free 
them from sin in the words ' dhamno dhamno r&jan ' ( Tai. S. 
L 3. 11. 2 ), and ' ud-uttamam ' ( Tai. S. I. 5. 11. 3 ). They lay 
samidha on the ahavanlya as in Varunapragh&sa. The animal 
sacrifice ends with the samsthsjapa as in darsapurnam&sa.

sacrifices are found in the texts prescribed for the attainment 
of such objects as prosperity, villages, eloquence &o. Tai. S> 
( II. 1. 1-10 ) refers to several such sacrifices. For example, 
Tai. S. II. 1.1. 1 says ' one who is desirous of prosperity should 
offer a white paau to V&yu ; one who is desirous of a village 
should sacrifice an animal to Vayu Kiyutvat j one who having 
command over speeoh or words is not able to speak eloquently 
should offer an ewe to Sarasvatl* ( II. 1. 2. 6 ). The Tai Br. 
( II. 8. 1-9 ) contains the anuvaky&s and yajyfis of the vapa, 
purodasa and havis offerings of many animal sacrifices. Ap. 
( XIX. 16-17) deals with kamya animal sacrifices. As v. III. 7 
gives the anuvakyas and yajyas of a group sacrifice ( Aika- 
dasina) of eleven animals MM to Agni, SarasvatI, Soma, PQsan, 
Brhaspati, Visve Devas, Indra, Maruts, Indra-Agni, Savitr, and 
Varuna; while Asv. III. 8. 1 sets out the anuvakyas and 
yajyas of eighteen animal sacrifices in addition. 

These follow the procedure of the nirudhapasubandha 
sacrifice and are all passed over here. 



8528. The AikSda&najmimal sacrifice is a special form of the 
animal sacrifice, for which Ap. XIV. 6-7 may be consulted. It follows 
the procedure of savaniya pasu ( Jai. VIII. 1. 14 ). In this there may 
be thirteen yOpas for eleven pasus or only one yflpa for all pasus. 
Eleven yupas are the ordinary ones, the 12th is called upasaya, the 
whole of which is chiselled, but is not imphtnted in a pit like the 
others; it lies near the yOpa to the south ; the 13th is called pBtnlvata and 
it is not higher than the navel when imbedded in the ground. The yOpas 
are so arranged as to rise on the south side i. e. the southern-most is the 
tallest of all. The pasu tied to the pStnlvata is meant for Tvaftr, but it 
is let off and sjya is offered. Jai. ( II. 3. 19 ) concludes that when the 
Vedic text says ' after carrying fire round the pStnlvata victim, it is let 
off', only a special matter is laid down concerning the pBtntvata 
victim. He further says ( in IX. 4. 56-60 ) that the Sjya offered is not 
a substitute for the vietim, but is a separate rite in wbioh the deity is 
the same. Vide Ext. VIII. 8. 27 ff. If there ba more yQpas than one, 
then the samskSras from afijana to parivySna (surrounding with a 
girdle) are all to be done on one, then on another and so on. Vide Jai.

CHAPTER XXXIII 

AGNI£TOMA*» 

Sacrifices are often divided for convenience into istf, pasu 
and soma. Acoording to Qaut. VIII. 21 and L&k Sr. V. 4. 24 
there are seven forms of soma sacrifices, viz. Agnistoma, 
Atyagnistoma, Ukthya, Sodasin, VSjapeya, Atirfttra and Aptor- 
yama. The Agnistoma is the model ( prakrti ) of all soma 
sacrifices. The Agnistoma is a one day ( aikahika or ekaha ) 
sacrifice and it is an integral part of the Jyotis^oma so much 
so that the two are often identified. Soma sacrifices are classi- 
fied into those that are finished in one day ( and so called 
ekaha ), those that are celebrated for more than one day up to 
twelve ( and so called ahlna ), those that extend over more than 
twelve days ( and are called Sattra ). The dvSdasaha is both a 
sattra and an ahlna. 8580 The Jyotis^oma ocoupies generally 
five days and the chief rites performed on these days are : (1) 
choosing of priests, madhuparka, dlksanlyestf, consecration of 
the saorifioer ( dlksS ) ; ( 2nd day ) Prayanlya istf ( i. e. opening 
istf ), purchase of soma, Stitheyestf ( isti offering hospitality to 
soma), Pravargya, 8 " 1 Upasad (homage twioe a day in the 
morning and evening ) ; ( 3rd day ) Pravargya and Upasad 
twice again ; (4th day) Pravargya and Upasad, Agnipranayana, 
Agnlsomapranayana, havirdhana-pranayana, animal sacrifice ; 
( 5th day called sutya or aavaniya ) pressing of soma, offering it 
and drinking it in the morning, mid-day and evening, the 
udayanlya ( concluding istf ), avabhrtha ( final purifioatory 
bath). In the following pages only a skeleton outline of

iliU History of bharmafaatora [ Oh. XXXlli 

Agnistoma ispresented, derived from the principal SrautasQtras. 
Jai. in VI. 2. 31 deolares that the performance of Jyotisfama is 
obligatory on all members of the three higher varnas, just as 
upanayana is, sinoe the word brahmana in Tai. S. VI. 3. 10. 5 
( a brahmana when born comes oharged with three debts ) is 
only illustrative. Agnistoma is so called beoause in it Agni 
is praised or beoause the last chant ( stotra ) is addressed to 
Agni un It is to be performed in vascmta ( spring ) every year 
and on the New Moon or Full Moon day ( Ap. X. 2. 2, 5 and 8, 
Eat. VII. 1. 4 and Sat. VII. 1 p. 562 ). The general view ex- 
pressed in Jai IV. 3. 37 was that one should perform a soma 
sacrifice after having performed darsapurnamasa, caturmSsyas 
and pasu sacrifice, but some held that it could be performed 
even before darsa-purnamasa, but after agnyadhana (Asv. IV. 1. 
1-2 and Sat. VII. 1. p.' 556 ). Jai. ( V. 4. 5-9 ) also states this 
as the view of some. Jaimini, however, declares that all modi* 
fioations of the Agnistoma must be performed after one has 
begun to perform darsapurnamasa ( V. 4. 26 ). The intending 
sacrificer sends a person called aomapravaka ( inviter to officiate 
at a soma sacrifice ) to invite br&hmanas who are thorough 
masters of the Veda, neither too young nor too old, with clear 
and loud voices and not deficient in any limb ( Tandy a Br. 
LI. 1, Drahyayana Sr. I. 1. 10, Ap. X. 1. 1). He invites 
the prinoipal four or all the 16 ( or 17, inoluding ' sadasya ' ) 
priests ( rtvij ), who make inquiries whether some other person 
has refused the office and whether the fee will be excellent. Those 
portions of the choosing mantras are uttered inaudibly wherein 
the priests are invoked as if they were divinities and the 
portion asau manuqab or tvam nuinusah. is uttered loudly.*"* 
When the priests come madhuparka is offered to them. The 
sacrificer goes to the king ( of the country ) to ask for a sacrifi- 
cial ground ( devayajana ), even if he has one already, with the 
formula ' god Varuna, give me devayajana '. tm This is a mere

form, but even the king has to make a similar request ( in his 
oase ) to the hotr and other priests. The requirements of a 
proper devayajana have already been given above (p. 988n). In 
the western portion of the devayajana from whioh all roots are 
uprooted, a pavilion >tSt ( vimita, a four-cornered mandapa ) is 
erected, the central ridge and the covering bamboos of whioh 
run from west to east, whioh has doors ( two oubits wide ) in all 
directions and whioh slightly inclines towards the east, or a 
rectangular house ( sals ) may be built, twenty aratnia long and 
ten aratnis wide ( KSt. VII. 1. 19-25, Ip. X. 5. 1-5, Baud. VI. 
1 ). A shed for cooking the vrata food is erected to the south of 
the pavilion and another to the west for the patnl ( wife of 
the saorifioer ). The sacrificer while in his house implants his 
g&rhapatya and ahavanlya fires on the aranis with a mantra 
' ayam te yonih ' ( Vaj. S. III. 14., Tai. S. I. 5. 2 ), comes to the 
devayajana, enters ( along with the priests and his wife ) the 
mandapa by the eastern door with the aranis in his hand, and 
touches the central post of the pavilion. The things that are 
required (sambhSrab) 8 * 88 are also brought to the pavilion. In 
the pavilion a vedi is prepared and fires are established after 
being produced by attrition. Offerings of ajya with the sam- 
bhSrayajus formulas ( Tai. A. III. 8 ), with the sapta-hotr 
formulas ( Tai. A. III. 5) are made and also a yupfthuti is 
offered. Outside the pavilion to its north the saorifioer gets the 
hair on the head, arm-pits and on the face out by a barber in a 
tent covered with mats, pares the nails of his hands first ( of the 
right hand first from the small finger ) and then of the feet. Jai. 
( III. 8. 3-11 ) establishes that it is the sacrificer ( and not the 
adhvaryu ) who pares his nails, outs his hair, brushes his teeth, 
subsists on milk. Sat. VII. 1. p. 587 states that the nails of the 
left hand are pared first and then of the right hand. He brushes 
his teeth with an udumbara twig, then he bathes in a reservoir 
of water or in a kunda after putting a golden piece in it with 
mantras, performs Soamana and drinks water as a consecration. 



2535. The pavilion is called prffgvamda or prsclnayamda and 
according to some it is 16 prakramas long ( from west to east ) and 12 
prakramas wide ( from sooth to north ). It may have four or fi>e ( one 
in the north-east ) doors and apertures in the four quarters. Vide Xp. 
X. 6. 5. 

2536. Baud. VI. 1 enumerates thirteen requisites ( sambhlras ) that 
the yajamSna brings with him and thirteen more whioh are placed round 
about the wife. 



1136 History of DharmaiOstra [ Ch. XXXIII 

All these from paring nails ( called apsu-dlk?a ) ,,w except the 
cutting of hair are also undergone by the wife at the instance 
of the pratiprasthfttr priest (but without mantras). The 
adhvaryu hands over a fine silken fresh garment to the saori- 
ficer which the latter wears. In the afternoon in the pragvamsa 
he partakes of food ( rice ) * m mixed with ghee and sprinkled 
over with curds and honey or whatever is' liked by him. The 
wife also does the same. He takes up butter ( navanlta ) with 
two bunches of darbha grass and smears himself thrice with 
them beginning from the face. He applies collyrium with a 
darbha blade twice to the right eye and once to the left or 
thrice to both. The adhvaryu performs the purification (pavana) 
of the sacrifioer outside the pragvamsa to its north by three 
bunohes of seven darbhas each rubbed twice over his body 
above the navel and once below the navel with mantras and 
the saorificer also mutters mantras. The wife also does all this 
( smearing the body with butter, applying afijana and purifica- 
tion ) without mantras at the instance of the pratiprasthfitr. 
The sacrifioer enters the pavilion by the eastern door and the 
wife by the western and occupy their respective seats. Then 
follows dlksanlyft istf**" which is so called because it effects a 
Bamsk&ra in the man intending to sacrifice and beoause after it 
is performed he is entitled to be called ' dlksita '. The conclu- 
sion in Jai. V. 3. 29-31 is that a man becomes a dlksita at the 
end of the dlksanlyft isti and has thenoeforward to observe the 
rules laid down for a dlksita and that one does not become a 
dlksita by being given the staff or the girdle &o. At first six 
fthutis called dlks&hutis are offered, four with fijya taken from 
the dhruvft into the sruva, 5th with the sruo and the sixth is 
called purn&hutl and is offered with sruc ( in which twelve ladl- 
ings with sruva have been made ). These six fthutis are called 
' audgrahana ' ( Ap. X. 8. 7 and com. on Sat. VIL 1. p. 591 ) or 

' audgrabhana ' ( Kftt. VII. 3. 16 ). In the dlksanlyft isti a cake

toBaud. the hair of the wife also is cut (VI. 3) The com. on Sat. VII. 
1. p. 587 makes the interesting remark that according to the BBtrakSra 
the adhvaryu himself pares the saorificer's nails, hut that as in his time 
the priests had no instruction in such matters and as people had come 
to look with disf avour on such a practice, the barber pares the nails. 

2538. Acoording to some the meal takes place before the cutting of 
hair (vide Ap. X. 6. 10).

prepared on eleven potsherds is offered to Agni-Visnu ( ox boiled 
rice with clarified butter). Some offered another offering of boiled 
rice to Aditi. Several matters that ooour in the model istf 
( such as observing a vrata, the girding up of the wife, outting 
off a portion for yajamana, phallkaranahoma, cooking anvaharya 
rioe as fee for the priests, samistayajus ) are omitted in this 
istf ( Baud. VI. 3 mentions ten matters that are omitted , 
Ap. X. 4. 12, Sat. VII. 1. p. 575 ). According to Jai. VIII. 
1. 3-10 the several actions done in the model istf are not 
to be extended to somayaga unless the vedic texts expressly say 
so, and Jai. X. 1. 4 establishes that there is no firambhanlya istf 
in dlksanlya and other istis of somayaga. The dlksanlya 
ends with the patnlsamyajas and the eating of the 2nd ids 
( Sat. VII. 1. p. 578 ). Certain rules are laid down about the 
pitch of the voice in the several rites. According to Ap. X. 4. 9 
everything is said inaudibly till the agnlsomlya rite. According 
to Kat. (VII. 2. 31-32) the voice reaches the highest pitch in the 
dlksanlya istf, the mantras in the prayanlya and atithya is^is 
are in a lower tone than in the dlksanlya and the upasad 
mantras are repeated inaudibly. The dlksa (consecration) of 
the sacrifioer and his wife proceeds as follows. J5 *° To the south 
of the Shavanlya two black antelope hides ( or one if two are 
not available ) with the neck portion to the east are spread on 
the altar with the hairy part outside. He ( the priest ) sits to 
the west of the antelope skin bending his right knee; the sacri- 
fioer touches the white and black spots ( or the line that joins 
them, Kat. VII. 3. 23), then oreeps upon the hide with his 
right knee bent and sits down on the western side of the hide. 
The sacrifioer ties round his waist above the garment worn by 
him a girdle of three strands made of hemp and munja grass, 
covers his right shoulder with a fresh garment and folds round 
his head a piece of cloth, he is given the horn of a black ante- 
lope about a span in length with three or five folds (from left 
io right), which he ties to the hem of his garment ( or in the 
corner of his upper garment ). He touohes his forehead above 
the right brow with the horn, draws a line with it from west 
to east outside the vedi, and if he wants at any time to scratch 

2540. All these several actions in the dik?5 are done to the accom- 
paniment of mantras as in VSj. IV. 9 ff. and Tai. S„ bnt they are not 
referred to for reasons of space. Elsewhere also mantras have been 
often omitted. 

H.D.143 



1138 History of Dharmaiastra [Oh. XXXIII 

his body he does so with that horn. Jai. ( XI. 4. 48-49 ) 
declares that the mantra is to be repeated only onoe even if 
the yajamftna feels the desire to scratch several parts of his 
body at the same time. The adhvaryu gives a staff of udum- 
bara ( or of some other sacrificial tree ) whioh is as high as the 
sacrificer's mouth ( or ohin ), which he raises up and keeps on 
his right shoulder. While the adhvaryu is doing these things 
for the yajam&na, the pratiprasthatr does the same things for 
the wife ( without mantras ) except that she has the yoktra 
girt round her upper garment, that her head is covered by a 
j&la ( a net or fillet ) of wool and she has a pieoe of some sacri- 
fioial tree one span long for scratching her body. The sacri- 
ficer and adhvaryu repeat long passages wherein the word 
dlksa occurs frequently ( A.p. X. 10. 6 and X. 11, 1 ), and the 
adhvaryu makes him repeat the sambhara-yajus mantras ( Tai. 
A. III. 8). The sacrificer then contracts the fingers of both hands 
one after another with mantras ( first the small fingers of both 
hands, then the ring-fingers of both hands and so on) and 
ultimately he clinches his fists. He observes silence. Some 
priest ( like the pratiprasthatr) other than the adhvaryu inaudi- 
bly declares ( to the gods ) thrice and loudly proolaims to the 
world thrice ' this brahmana has undergone the consecration, 
son of so and so, grandson of so and so, great-grandson of so 
and so, the son of such and such a woman, grandson of such 
and such a woman and great-grandson of such and such a 
woman '. Even when the sacrificer was a ksatriya or vaisya, 
the announcement was still to be 'this brahmana' 541 &c.,' since 
after dlksa a person was supposed to be reborn and to be a 
child of holy prayer and to have become pure enough for 
receiving spiritual influences. The Sat. Br. III. 3. 3. 12 states 
' he who is consecrated becomes an embryo'. Dlksa takes plaoe 
in the afternoon (5p. X. 12. 1) and the sacrificer observes 
silence till the appearance of stars in the evening. The 
adhvaryu directs the milking of two cows to supply milk for

the sacrifioer and his wife who are to subsist on the milk of the 
two cows during the period of the sacrifice. This vrata (obser- 
vance ) of subsisting on milk is deolared by Jai. ( IV. 3. 8-9 ) 
to be kratvartha (an obligatory rule) and not purusartha 
( recommendatory ). Vide also Jai. VL 8. 28. Some allowed 
rice or barley to be cooked in that milk. The two cows were 
milked in two separate vessels, one of whioh ( meant for the 
sacrificer) was heated on the garhapatya and the other ( for the 
wife ) was heated on the daksina fire. A ksatriya or vaisya 
sacrificer could take gruel or araiksa respectively or all persons 
could subsist on milk or on rice cooked in milk or on fruits 
( if enough milk was not available ) or if he had a desire for 
ourds, he could use curds or use fried barley grains or he could 
take ghee. He was to take his food at midday or midnight 
long after ordinary men have taken their meals and he took his 
food from a pot which was not earthenware and the wife from 
a copper pot. Persons who were not dlksitas were not to see 
him when taking his milk or other vrata diet. The wife was 
also to take her milk or other diet in her own place. Vide Ap. 
X 16 and Kat. VII. 4. 19-34 for details. The dlksita and his 
wife ( to some extent ) have to observe certain rules ( till the 
final bath ) and people also had to observe some rules with 
reference to him. He has to keep awake on the night of the 
dlksa ( Jai. XII. 1. 17 ), on the night when soma is purchased 
and on the night before the pressing day. He is not "" to 
speak with women or sudras nor should a sudra follow him. 
If he is obliged to speak to a sudra he should do so by 
employing a messenger belonging to the three higher varnas. 
He may speak to or bless another, but he was not to bow 
to another, even if the latter was his acarya or father-in- 
law or a king. No one was to touch him or to address the 
dlksita by his name ( but use only such terms of address 
as ' bhoh \ ' dlksita ' &c. ). The sacrificer was not to keep 
aside the antelope horn till the fees were distributed. He 
oould laugh covering his face with his hand and should 
not show his teeth. He was not ordinarily to answer oalls 
of nature by day, but if he has to do so, he must do so in a 
shaded spot. He has to observe complete oelibaoy. While 
he is consecrated for the sacrifice, he does not go out by the 

2542. ip. X. 12-15, Baud. VI. 6 give long lists of the observances 
for a dikgita out of whioh a few are set out above.

western door, nor does he perform the daily agnibotra, nor 
vaisvadeva nor offering of bali nor perform the darsapurnamasa 
istf ( Jai. XII. 1. 19-23 ), but he may employ another to do all 
these. He must speak the truth and address people in a pure 
and conciliatory style adding the word 'canasita' when address- 
ing a brahmana and the word ' vicaksana * when addressing 
a ksatriya or vaisya ( vide Ait. Br. I. 6 ). He must always 
be in the pavilion at sunrise and sunset; he sleeps on the 
ground to the south of the ahavanlya with his head to the east 
and sleeps on his right side and does not turn his back to the 
fire. He always sits on antelope hide and never leaves it and 
his staff ( except when answering calls of nature ). No one 
1b to eat the food given by a dlksita till the agnlsomlya victim 
or its omentum is offered. It is recommended by all the sutras 
that dlksa ( consecration ) should not be finished in one day, 
but it should extend over 12 days or a month or a year or till 
from being fat he becomes lean ( vide Ap. X. 14. 8, X. 15. 4, 
Asv. IV. 2. 13-15 ). Every day ( while the dlska lasts ) the 
sacrificer observes silence from the afternoon till the appearance 
of stars and in the morning from before sunrise till the sun goes 
up. The dlksita is allowed to go himself or to send agents 
called ( sanlhaia ) 25 * 3 to colleot money and materials necessary 
for the sacrifice. He has to observe many rules on his journey 
( vide Ap. X. 19. 6-16 ). 

After the day ( or days of dlksS ), the next day the first rite 
is the prayanlya "** ( opening ) istf. In this isti caru ( rice ) 
cooked in milk is offered to Aditi ( Jai. IX. 4. 32-40 ) and four 
offerings of ajya to four more deities viz. Pathya Svasti, Agni, 
Soma and Savitr in the four directions ( viz. east, south, west 
and north ) respectively. Caru is offered to Aditi in the centre. 
Agni Svistakrt is the sixth deity. According to Asv. IV. 3. 3 
no ajyabhagas are offered in this is^i, but according to Kat. 
VII. 5. 15 they are offered. The priests that offioiate in this 
isti should as far as possible officiate in the Udayanlya 
( concluding ) isti. The rites of this isti end with the first 
Sarhyu,* 5 *' but there is no patnl-sarhyaja and no samistayajus.

The puronuvfikya verses in this isti become the yajya verses in 
the udayanlyS isti and vice versa ( vide Asv. IV. 3. 2 for them ). 
He keeps aside in a well-known place in the pragvafa&a the 
cooking pot ( from whioh the leavings of rioe sticking to the 
bottom are not removed according to some ), the meksana and 
the barhis ( except the prastara ) for use in the udayanlyS. 
Jai. ( XL 2. 66-68 ) refers to this use of niskasa in the udaya- 
nlyS isti. 

Then oomes the purchase of soma ( referred to in the 
Brahmanas and Sutras as ' rSjan ' ). Soma is purchased from a 
brahmana of the Kutsa gotra or from a sudra ( Ap. X. 20. 12 
allows it to be purchased from any brahmana ). MM Jai. 
III. 7. 31 states that the vendor of soma is someone other than 
the priests. The seller of soma is asked to free it from the weeds 
that may be mixed up with it ; the adhvaryu turns his back 
towards soma when this ( weeding ) is being done and neither 
the adhvaryu nor his assistants nor the sacrifioer nor the latter's 
sons should do the weeding out nor does anyone of these 
see it being done ( Sat. VII. 1, p. 609 ). The soma plant is 
placed on ths southern part of the red hide of a bull by the 
pratiprasthatr spread on the place where uparavas ( four sound- 
ing holes ) will be made later on and the seller of soma sits 
on the northern part of the hide. A water jar is placed in front 
of soma. The doors of the sacrificial hall are shut, the adhvaryu 
pours into the juhu four times ajya from the dhruva ladle 
used in the prSyanlyS ( or five times for those who are paflca- 
vatUns), ties a piece of gold by a blade out of the darbhas 
spread on the altar, puts down into the juhu the blade with 
the gold and makes an offering into the shavanlya of that ajya 
( this offering is called hiranyavatl ahuti ) ; he takes out the 
piece of gold, oasts the blade ( with which it was tied ) on 
the vedi and ties the gold piece with a thread. The doors 
of the hall are opened and the adhvaryu and yajamana come 
out. To the south of the eastern door of the sacrificial hall 
stands a heifer ( oalled somakrayam ), that is one, two or three

years M * 7 old, is tawny, has yellowish brown eyes or is red ( but 
has no red eyes), has not given birth to a calf, has no defioienoy 
and is not tied ( vide £p. VI. 20. 2-5 and Sat. VII. 2, p. 623 for 
further details ). The cow is not held by her ear or her foot is 
not tied by a rope ( she may be held by the neck, if necessary ). 
She is invoked by the adhvaryu ( who is sitting ) with a mantra 
' oidasi ' ( Vsj. S. IV. 19, Tai. S. 1. 2. 4. 1 ). The cow is led towards 
the north, the adhvaryu and yajam&na follow her. After she 
goes six steps, at her 7th step, the brahma and yajam&na sit 
down to the cow's right, behind her sits the adhvaryu and the 
nesfc priest to her north. They keep the golden piece on the 
spot where the 7th step is put by her ( which is first covered with 
his folded hands by the adhvaryu ) and make an offering of it 
to Aditi ( adityai idam na mama ). Taking the sphya the 
adhvaryu drawa lines round the 7th foot-print ( once with a 
mantra, twice silently) from right to left ( Ap. X. 23. 3 adds 
that lines are drawn also with the antelope horn of the sacri- 
ficer ) ; the dust on the lines is gathered with the hand and put 
into a pot ( sthall ) and handed over to the yajam&na who passes 
it on to his wife who invokes the oow with a mantra. He washes 
his hand ( that has the piece of gold in it ) on the 7th foot-print 
( of the oow ), pours Borne water on the dust oolleoted in a pot, 
divides the dust into three parts, one of whioh is placed on the 
cold ashes of the g&rhapatya, the 2nd on the cold ashes of the 
ahavanlya and the third is given to the wife who places it in 
the house. The adhvaryu ties the piece of gold to his small 
finger ( on which it must be at the time of apyayana and pres- 
sing of soma and at the time of taking the amsu and adabhya 
cups ). The adhvaryu direots the saorificer's servant to bring a 
piece of cloth for tying soma, another for covering it all round 
and a turban ; the first is carried by the adhvaryu or yajam&na 
and the rest by the pratiprasthatr. They go with their faces to 
the east towards the soma which is in a four-wheeled cart

covered all round and above with mats &c. Detailed rules 
follow how soma stalks ( aihiu ) are selected and taken with the 
hand, tied in the cloth and covered with the turban ( Ap. X. 24- 
7-14, Kst. VII. 7. 12-21 ). The yajamana pays homage to soma 
and waits upon Aditi ( Ap. X. 25. 1 ). The adhvaryu hands 
over the soma (so tied and turbaned) to the vendor of soma 85 *' and 
there ensues a dialogue ( which is a mock drama ) between the 
vendor and the adhvaryu wherein they higgle for the price of 
the soma ( five times, beginning with a kala or i*th or the thigh 
of the cow and ending with the whole cow ). Gold piece is also 
offered to the vendor of soma, who says ' soma is sold to you 
but offer me some other animals ' and the adhvaryu replies 
' yours are the gold piece, clothes, goats, another cow, a cow and 
bull and three other cows. ' Adhvaryu comes with the soma in 
his right hand and pushes aside the garment from the sacrifioer's 
right thigh and plaoes the soma tied in a piece of cloth on the 
thigh of the saorificer, who mutters the text ' svana bhrajan- 
ghare 8M » &c. ' ( Vaj. VI. 27, Tai. S. I. 2. 7. 1 ). Ultimately the 
gold piece and somakrayanl cow are brought back, another is 
offered in exchange and the former is sent to the oowpen belong- 
ing to the sacrificer. Ap. ( X. 27. 8 ) and Sat. (VII. 2. p. 644) say 
that according to some the vendor is always struck with sticks 
and clods of earth ( i. e. there is a show of seizing the soma 
from him and driving him away with sticks, vide Eat. VII. 8. 27 
also). The sacrifioer's staff is handed over to the maitra- 
varuna priest ( vide Jai. IV. 2. 16-18 ) and the sacrificer holds 
in both his hands the bundle of soma placed on his thigh, 
gets up, plaoes his hand on his head and thereon the bundle of 
soma, approaches a oart ( sakata ) kept to the south ( of the place 

2548. The Sat. Br. III. 3. 3 (S. B. E. vol. 26. pp. 69-70) contains the 
higgling at length. Vide also Ap. X. 25. 1-16, Kst. VII. 8. 1-21. Sat. 
(VII. 2. pp. 636-643) sets out what things are offered in exchange of 
soma and the dialogue between the adhvaryu and the vendor of soma. 
There were several options as to the things offered in exchange for soma. 
They were ten viz. seven cows, a gold piece, olothes, a she-goat ; some 
said they were 13 (ten cows plus the other three ) or only four (one cow 
and the other three ). 

2549. SvEna, BhrSja and others are supposed to be Gandharvai, 
guardians of the cow and other things offered.as the price of soma. Vide 
lat. Br. III. 3. 3. 11 (S. B. B. vol. 26 p. 72 ). Jaimini (XII. 4. 5-7) states 
that ten things are offered as the price of soma and that soma is not 
purobased by offering these separately, but by offering thelh in one lot 
(tamuceaya). Baud. VI. 14 enumerates them in one place.

where soma was bought ) that is washed, is covered with a mat 
or the like and ha& all its parts complete. The adhvaryu 
spreads on the box of the cart a blaok antelope-skin with the 
neck portion to the east and hairy side upwards, places the 
soma thereon, covers it with another pieoe of cloth, ties a skin 
to a staff as a flag. Two oxen are yoked to the oart, the Subra- 
hmanya priest (an assistant to the udgatr) standing on the 
ground between the two shafts of the cart drives the oxen hold- 
ing two palasa branches in his hand ( as whips ). The adhvaryu 
touches the cart and directs the hotr to repeat a verse for soma 
that is bought ( or being taken round ) and direots the subra- 
hmanya priest to pronounce the Subrahmanya invocation. The 
hotr stands three steps behind the cart between the two wheel- 
tracks, and while keeping his heels firm and unmoved throws up 
to the south with a verse ( tvam viprah, Asv. IV. 4. 2 ) clods ( or 
dust ) thrice with the forepart of his foot, then utters standing 
' him bhurbhuvah svarom ' and a verse ' bhadrad abhi sreyah 
prehi ' („5iv. IV. 4. 2 ). While following the moving cart 
between wheel-tracks he recites Rg. I. 91. 9-11, X. 71. 10, IV. 
53. 7 ( half ) and stops. When the cart stops the hotr approaches 
the soma from the south side of the cart, and stands facing it. 
He touohes the soma or the cloth covering it with two verses 
( called paridhanlyS viz. Rg. I. 91. 19 and VIII. 42. 3). Then 
the sacrificer touches the soma and comes to the sacrificial hall 
(sala) along with all the priests. The subrahmanya priest 
recites the famous subrahmanya litany ,M0 ( which is an

hmanySin the feminine gender ), Tai. Br. I. 12. 3-4. This litany is 
required on the 2nd and following days of the Agnistoma and almost 
on all days of other Soma sacrifices. On the 2nd day, after the word 
iftn»ry«lt«»t, the subrahmanya says ' s*r| bfvpt. ', on the 3rd day g^ 5W* ,

recited after the performance of atithya istf, but according to 
Ap. and Kit. it is recited before Atithya. At the time of each 
upasad the subrahmanya litany is recited (Sat. VII. 4. 
p. 676 ). According to Lat. the subrahmanya stands inside the 
spot where the altar would be prepared and recites the litany and 
the yajamana touohes him and the wife touches the yajam&na. 
The formula is ' O Subrahmanya ( Indra who protects excellent 
prayers ), come, O Indra I Lord of hart ( bay ) steeds 1 Ram of

gives rules about the accents of the SubrahmanyS. According to Lst. 
and DrShySyana I. 3. 17 the subrahmanya litanies after the upasads are 
finished are recited near the utkara outside the altar. The priest takes 
breath at each of the first two words ( gwgr , "TJ3^ ), then again after $ft 
and after ■Terror- This invocation is repeated thrice ( .5 p. X. 28. 6, LBf. 
1.3.10). On the Agnljomiya day (day before pressing) before the 
reference to sutyS, the words ' aaau yajate' (this, so and so, offers 
sacrifioe ) occur and the names ■( naksatra, gotra and vySvahSrika 
names ) of the sacrificer are mentioned with the names of his ances- 
tors (son of so and so, grandson of so and so, great-grandson 
of so and so) and then the names of bis living descendants 
according to seniority by birth, both males and females, in the words 
' father of such and suoh a son &c. '. Manu IX. 126 refers to this last. 
In Kg. I. SI. 1 and I. 52. Tlndra has the appellation ' mesa ' and there 
is a legend that Indra became a ram and drank the soma of Medhatithi 
KXnva. In Bg. VIII. 2. 40 it is said that Indra in the form of a ram 
carried off MedhyEtithi Ksnva. In Bg- I. 51. 13 Indra is spoken of as 
born of the MenB of Vrsanasva (menBbhavo vrsanaa>asya ) and SByana 
quotes the TSndya that Mens was the daughter of Vrsanadva. Indra 
is addressed as Kaudika in Bg. I. 10. 11. The legend of Indra's lovefor 
AhalyS, the wife of Gautama, is well-known. Vide REmByana I. 48 
and VisnupurBna I. 9. 21. Jaimini (in IX. 1. 42-44) states that when 
the SubrahmanyS litany is uttered in Agnistut and other rites and when 
for Indra the word Agni is substituted, there is no substitution of other 
adjectives in plaoe of Harivat and others. Sahara, however, notes that 
ySjfiikas do substitute other words viz. they says '»w WT»r*S Wr8^n«* f*- 
?P$I ijyftRfV srra^ir PtW»T Tfa I '. KumSrilabhatta in his TantravBrtika

many days, to the soma feast.' Then he adds ' Ye Gods and 
brahmanas! come hither 1' While the Subrahmanya is being 
reoited the saorifioer mutters certain prayers ( Ap. X. 28. 5 )• 
Near the eastern door of the pragvamsa the pratiprasth&tr stands 
holding by the ear a goat ( as a present to king Soma ) that has 
white and dark spots of hair or red and dark ones, that is 
hornless, fat and bearded. The cart is stopped to the east of the 
pragvamsa with its shafts to the east or north, the yoke-pins 
are taken out, the oxen are released from the yoke ( or only one 
ox, the northern one, is released). While this is being done prepa- 
rations are made for atithyesti to receive hospitably as a guest 
king Soma. The adhvaryu and three other priests make ready a 
stool or couch (asandl) of udumbara wood, having feet as high as 
the navel, with a board one araini square plaited with cords of 
mufija grass, on which a black antelope skin is spread. On this 
the soma is placed after being taken out of the cart. Soma 
thus seated on the couch is brought inside the sals by the eastern 
door, is taken to the west of the ahavanlya and established to the 
south of the ahavanlya to the east of the seat of the brahma priest. 
Then follows the work of atithyesti. The wife quickly takes out 
the materials for a cake on nine potsherds for Visnu ( who is the 
principal deity in this \s%\ ). In all istfs (in Agnistoma ) after 
the dlksanlya up to udayanlya ( the concluding is^i ) there is no 
agnyanvadhana, no taking up of vrata, no subsisting on fast 
food, no gifts and no choosing of brahmS. There are only five 
prayaja offerings and no anuyajas. ,5SI Fire is produced by 
attrition, and the istf comes to an end after the first ida. For 
details see Ap. X. 30 and Eat. VIII. 1. After the ida is eaten 
there is t&nunaptra, a solemn convenant made by the sacrificer 
and the priests pledging themselves in the name of Tanunapat 
( the mighty blowing wind, that is the witness of all living 
beings ) not to injure eaoh other. They make this ,iW covenant 
by touching simultaneously clarified butter taken in a vessel 
of kRthsya or in a camasa from the ajya in the dhruvS ladle 
used in the atithya and placed on the southern hip (south 
corner of west side ) of the altar. That clarified butter used 
for this covenant is shaken by the adhvaryu and is kept by him 
in a vessel ( which is not earthen-ware ) in a well-known spot 

2651. Vide Jaimini X. 7. 88-39 and 40 for the proposition that 
there are no aanySja offerings in Stithyesfi and that it ends with ids'.

and is given mixed with the fast milk ( vrata-dugdha ) to the 
saorificer in the afternoon (for eating). Then follows the 
avantara-dlksa ( intermediate consecration ) of the sacrifices in 
which he offers a fuel-stick in the ahavanlya fire ( with ' agne 
vratapas' Vaj. S. V. 6), the wife also silently offers a fuel-stick 
in g&rhapatya; he touches water heabfed in a vessel called 
madantl, clenches his fists more closely, tightens his girdle 
and drinks only hot milk. All priests also touch the 
madantl water and together with the saorificer strengthen*'** 
the soma stalks with their hands holding golden pieces with the 
mantra ' arhsur-arhsu * ( Vaj. S.V. 7, Tai. S. I.;2. 11. 1 ). Then they 
place their right hands one after another on the prastara which 
is on the southern end of the vedi with the palms turned 
upwards and cover the palms with their left palms turned 
downwards ( this action being called nihnava, according to 
Ap. XI. 1. 12 and Est. VIII. 2. 9 ). Nihnava 8 "* is a kind of 
salutation to Heaven and Earth. 

Then follows Fravargya and after that Upasad or the 
Upasad may precede Pravargya ( Ap. XI. 2. 5, Sat. VII. 4. 
p. 662 ). Both are done twice, in the morning and then in the 
afternoon, for at least three days ( 2nd, 3rd and 4th) if soma is 
to be pressed on the 5th, but if soma is to be pressed on the 7th 
or any later day ( from the beginning ) then there will be more 
Pravargyas and UpBsads. 2 "' The same barhis, prastara and 
paridhis employed in the atithya are used in the upasads and in 
the rite of Agnlsomlya pasu. 

Pravargya is separately dealt with in most sutras, as in 
Ap. XV. 5-12, Kat. XXVI, Baud. IX. 6 ff. It was supposed to 
provide the saorificer with a new celestial body 8 ' 5 '. It was an 



2553. This is called 'Spyayana' (strengthening or increasing), 
which according to com. on Ap. XI. 1. 11 and Sat. VII. 3. 661 means 
'touching with a mantra' or according to others 'sprinkling with 
water '. VBj. 8. V. 7. and Tai. 3. I. 2. 11. 1 read s»gtg$ %i M t mmumfi i-

independent rite by itself ( apurva ) and was not the modi- 
fication of any other rite (vide com. on K5t. XXVI. 2. 5). It 
appears from Ap. XIII. 4. 3-5 that the Pravargya rite was no* 
neoessarily performed in every Agnistoma. The gharma is 
styled Samr&t in Vsj. S. 39. 5, is identified with the sun, is said 
to be the head of Yajfia and the hot milk was divine life and 
light. Vide Ait. Br. IV. 1, £at. Br. XIV. 1-4, Tai. Ar. IV. 1-42, 
V. 1-12 ; and Haug's translation of Ait. Br. pp. 41-43 ( note ), 
S. B. E vol. 44, Intro. XLVI — L. An earthernware vessel, one 
span in height, is made, the middle of whioh is contracted ( like 
a mortar ), whioh has a rim or belt ( mekhals ) about three 
fingers lower down from the top which is a large and deep 
bowl and has at the end a hole or spout for pouring in liquid. 
This is called mahavlra and it resembles three pots placed on 
one another. There are two other earthenware vessels ( which 
are called mahavlra ). There are also two milking bowls ( pin- 
vana ) and two round plates called rauhina for baking two 
oakes. All the three are heated with the fire of horse dung 
kindled at the garhapatya ( or daksina according to some ) fire» 
baked in a square pit like ordinary, pans and then taken out. 
The two purodSsas baked on the round rauhinas are offered into 
fire in the morning and evening to Day and Night respectively. 
The vessel called mahavlra is placed on a raised clay platform 
and fire is kindled round it, and when it is hot ghee is poured 
into it. The principal mahavlra is the first vessel and the other 
two are not to have the different processes performed on them 
( they are apracarariiya, Ap. XV. 6. 11 ). These other two are 
kept oovered with cloth on the big asandl to the north of the 
stool on which soma is placed and to the south of the ahavanlya 
( Kat. XXVI. 2. 17 ). To the boiling ghee in the principal vessel 
are added the milk of a cow and of a she-goat having a male 
young one. The hot milk thus mixed and contained in the 
mahavlra is called ' gharma ', of whioh offerings are made to 
Asvins, Vayu, Indra ( with Vasus and Rudras and Adityas ), 
to Savitr, Brhaspati, Yama. The sacrifioer drinks ( the priests 
only smell ) the remainder by the upayamanl. The hotr repeats 
several mantras at various stages from the time the mahavlra is 
placed on the raised platform up to the time when the hot milk 
is offered and the priest called prastotr chants s&mans. The 
whole of this ceremony is called Pravargya. A few interesting 
matters out of the numerous details of this rite are indioated 
here. All the doors of the Bacrifioial hall are screened with 
cloth, the wife's shed also is so screened and she is to sit in Iter 



Cn. XXXIII ] Agrd$toma-Pravargya 1149 

shed ( and not to see the mahavlra,'" 7 but at a later stage she 
looks at it and repeats a mantra, Eat. XXVI. 4. 13 ). Whatever 
wooden patras are required in this rite they are" 58 made of 
udumbara and the cords are made of munja grass. The paridhis 
were thirteen and of vikankata and the fuel-sticks for boiling 
the gharma were to be of the same wood or of kbadira, palasa, 
udumbara and a few other trees. There were three black antelope 
skins to be used as fans and two rukmas ( plates or bars ) of 
gold and silver, two vedas ( bunches of kufla ), one of which has 
its ends cut off. Special rules are laid down about the clay out 
of which the mah&vlra vessel is to be made ( vide A.p. XV. 1. 
9 ff.) viz. 8559 it was to be dug from a pit to the east of the ahavanlya 
fire ; with that earth was to be mixed the dust dug by a wild 
boar and the clay from an ant-hill, putlka ( a plant ), the hair of 
a goat and of a black antelope skin ; on it an aja ( she-goat ) 
was to be milked. The clay so mixed is to be carried only by 
men of the higher castes and hot water is to be poured on the 
clay only from madantl vessels* 5 ' in order to mix the various 
ingredients. No sudra nor woman is to look at all this. Two 
vessels for milking the cow and the she-goat are made of this 
very clay. The Mahavlra is to be lifted up only with two 
wooden pieces like tongs ( called parisasa or sapha ) and never 
otherwise. The fisandl ( stool or chair ) on which the mahavlra 
is to be placed is bigger than the one for king Soma ( thereby 
bringing out its super-eminence as sarhrat ) and it is placed 
north of the seat for Soma. Two kharas ( mounds covered with

sand) are made to the north of the gSrhapatya and of the 
ahavanlya and a third mound ( called uoohista khara ) is made 
in the north-east of the pr&gvarhsa, having a channel outside 
( the sala ) for wiping off the leavings. A silver blade or plate 
of one hundred rakhkas ( berries for weighing ) in weight is 
inserted in the loose sand of the western mound, sheaths of reed 
grass kindled at the garhapatya are thrown on the mound and the 
mahavlra vessel is placed thereon. Then pieces of vikahkata wood 
( paridhis ) are laid round the Mahavlra by the adhvaryu and 
pratiprasthatr, in all 13, the last being placed by the adhvaryu. 
Then a gold bar or plate ( representing the Sun ) is placed on 
the Mahavlra pot. The adhvaryu fans the fire thrice by means 
of the three fans made of black antelope skin from right to left 
and then thrice from left to right. When a blaze is produced 
the gold plate is taken away. According to the Ait. Br. IV. 2 and 
Asv. IV. 6. 3' the hotr recites several verses ( 21 in number ) 
when the empty MahSvIra is being heated ( they constitute the 
purva patala ) and several operations such as anointing it are 
being performed. The Ait. Br. IV. 5 further prescribes 21 verses 
for recitation by the hotr when the cow is being milked ( they 
are called uttara patala ). Vide Adv. IV. 7. 4 also. 

According to Sat. Br. XIV. 2. 2. 44-46 and Jai. III. 3. 32-33 
thePravargya was not to be performed at a sacrificer's first 
soma sacrifice and it was not to be performed for anyone and 
everyone, but only for him who was well-known or was a com- 
plete master of the veda. On the day previous to the soma 
pressing day, the two performances of pravargya and upasad 
are combined and gone through in the morning and on that day 
takes place the ' udvSsana ' ( setting out or orderly disoharge ) 
of the pravargya either by laying out the pravargya apparatus 
in the form of a human body or by throwing them in the midst 
of water or in a river island &o. They ( the priests and yaja- 
mftna ) set out as a general rule ( Ap. XV. 16. 6 ) all the imple- 
ments on the uttaravedi, the prinoipal mahavlra vessel as the 
head is placed olose to the front side of the navel of the uttara* 
vedi, the two other mahavlras are placed to its east, the bunch 
of kusa grass ( called veda ) is placed on top of the mahavlra to 
represent sikha (top-knot of hair), the two lifting sticks (saphas) 
are placed on two sides as arms and so on. Vide Sat. Br. XIV. 3. 
1. 16, Ap. XV. 15, Kat. 26.7.14 ff. According to Ap. XV. 11. 10-13 
the yajam&na and some of the priests viz. hotr, adhvaryu, 
brahma, pratiprasthatr and agnldhra drink the remainder of 
the milk ( gharma) from the upayamanl (a large wooden spoon). 



Ch. XXXIII ] Agnitfoma-Pravargya 1151 

"When a person performs pravargya he should not for a year 
partake of meat, should not approach a sudra woman for sexual 
intercourse, should not drink water from an earthen pot and 
should not allow a sudra to eat the leavings of his food ( Up. 
XV. 13. 13 ). According to Sat. Br. XIV. 3. 1. 32 ff the gold 
plate goes to the brahma, the gharma to adhvaryu, while accord- 
ing to Ap. XV. 13. 1 the sacrificer gives the gold and silver 
plates to adhvaryu, the cow to hotr, the she-goat to agnldhra 
and a pregnant cow to brahma. 

Upasad Kil is an is^i. The several processes such as agnyan- 
vadhana found in the darsa-purnamasa are not performed in 
this isti, but a start is made from the carrying forward of the 
pranlta water. Offerings of clarified butter are made in tbis 
isti to Agni and Soma with the juhu ladle and to Visnu with 
the juhu after pouring therein the ajya taken in the upabhrt 
ladle ; that is, the principal deities are Agni, Soma and Visnu 
and that besides the Shut is of ajya to these there are the upasad 
ahutis with the mantra ' ya te ' &o. Vide the com. on Eat. 
VIII. 2. 35 for all details. All actions done after the atithya 
isti such as the strengthening of soma, the ninbava, the recital 
of the subrahnianya litany take place in each upasad ( per- 
formed in the morning and afternoon for three or more days ). 
There are no ajyabh&gas, no prayajas nor anuyajas and no 
offering to Agni Svistakrt (Asv. IV. 8. 8.). The three verses, 
Rg. VII.15.1~3, are repeated thrioe each, so as to make nine kind- 
ling verses (s&midhenls) in the morning and Rg. II. 6. 1-3 
( repeated thrice ) are samidhenls in the evening, Upasad 
offering is made by the sruva ladle with the mantra ' ya te 
agne ayahsayS tanur ,Si6B (Vaj. S. V. 8) on the first day, on 
the 2nd day with the same verse but reciting ' rajahsaya ' f or 
'ayahsaya* and on the 3rd day with 'harisaya' for ' ayabiaya'.

1152 History of DharmaiSstra [ Ch. XXXIII 

The upasad mantras show that they have reference to the 
sieges of iron, silver and gold castles. How these mantras 
came to be inserted here it is difficult to say. Vide Sat. Br. 
III. 4. 4. 3-4 ( for the cities and their siege ). Ap. XI. 4. 8 
adds that if a hostile king gives battle or attacks the capital of 
a ksatriya performing a soma sacrifice, on the first upasad a 
piece of iron should be placed in the sruva ladle and offered 
along with the clarified butter, on the 2nd upasad a piece of 
silver and on the 3rd a pieoe of gold Bhould be so placed. The 
yajyas of the morning upasad become the anuvakyas in the 
afternoon and vice versa. Jaimini (X. 7. 43-46) establishes 
that Upasads are special istfs ( apurva ) and only those parts 
that are expressly stated in the texts are to be performed in them 
and not others that occur in the model istf. The procedure of 
upasad is like opamsuyaja (Sat. VII. 4. p. 666). 

On the 2nd day of the upasads after the morning pravargya 
and upasad rites are performed the great vedi for the soma 
sacrifioe is measured and made ( Eat. VIII. 3. 6, Sat. VII. 4. 
pp. 679-685 and Ap. XI. 4. 11 ). In front of the ahavanlya to 
the east a peg (sanku) is driven in the ground at a distanoe 
of 6 prakramas ( Baud. VI. 22 ) or according to Kat. VIII. 3. 7 
at the distance of 3 prakramas to the east from the eastern 
post ( i. e. the middle of the door ) of the ordinary agni-sala 
a peg is driven which is called antahpatya ( intermediate ) or 
talamukhiya (according to Baud.); 36 prakramas to the east 
from this peg another peg is driven, which is called yupavatiya 
I i. e. connected with the hole for yupa). A cord is stretched 
between these two pegs and is called prs^hyS (spine). On both 
the south and north sides of the first peg (i. e, of antahpatya) 
pegs are driven at the distance of 15 prakramas and on the south 
and north sides of the 2nd peg two pegs are driven at a 
distanoe of 12 prakramas each. In this way the west side 
called sroni ( hips ) of the mahavedi is 30 prakramas ,,M and the 

2563. For prakrama vide p. 989 n. 2239 above. Instead of prakramas, 
the measurement may be only with the padas (footsteps of the saorifioer). 
Vide com. on Jp. XI. 4. 13. Aocording to com. on Est. VIII. 3. 14 
a pada is equal to two prakramas. KBt. VIII. 3. 10 optionally allows 
16t prakramas on the north and south of the first peg i. e. the droni 
(west side of the matured! ) will then be 33 prakramas (instead of 30). 
Even so early as the Tal. 8. these measurements of the mahK?edi are 

given t 'rtarwrtiw «rem%uft w«rft SRr/«knsn»ft ^Ntfi?: 5<«nf%T«ft »

Ch. XXXIII J Agm^tomarMahavedi 1153 

east side called afnsa (shoulders) is 24 prakramas and the 
length of the mahavedi is 36 prakramas. A rope is passed all 
round the mahavedi. Almost all the samskaras that are 
performed for the vedi in darsapQrnamasa are performed for the 
great vedi in somayaga ( Sat. VII. 4. p. 685 ). An uttaravedi 
( a quadrangular platform raised high ) is measured on the 
mahavedi in its eastern part. This uttaravedi is on its west 
side ( sroni ) ten padas ( i. e. five on the south and five on the 
north of the prs^hya ) and on its east side ( amsa ) eight padas 
( some hold that the uttaravedi is 10 padas on all sides i. e. a 
perfect square ). The catvala pit ( i. e. its southern shoulder 
or the middle point of the southern side ) is \\ padas ( or one 
prakrama, according to Sat. p. 687 ) to the north from the 
northern shoulder of the mahavedi towards the west, while the 
utkara near which the agnldhra sits is 12 prakramas to the 
west of the catvala "" ( i. e. its western side or its middle ) and 
one prakrama to the north of the line of the vedi. The utkara 
is about two padas in extent ( com. on Sat. VII. 4. p. 687 ). The 
way to and from the vedi is between the utkara and the catvala 
pit. The vedi is prepared ( i. e. its earth is loosened, clods are 
broken, roots taken out ) with the sphya, a rib ( of some holy 
animal ) or an axe. For the nabhi vide at p. 1113 above. That 
day the vedi remains covered with the branches of udumbara 
or plaksa tree. 

On the next day both the pravargyas and upasads of the 
morning and afternoon are gone through in the morning. 
After the udvamna of the pravargya, the bringing forward of 
the fire ( agnipranayana ) from the ahavanlya to the uttaravedi 
takes place. The fire placed on the nabhi becomes the ahavanlya 
for all actions in the soma sacrifice and the original ahavanlya 
becomes the garhapatya ( Ap. XI. 5. 9-10 ). Kusa grass, the 
fuel and vedi are thrice sprinkled with water and the vedi is 
covered with that grass with the points of the blades to the east. 
Two carts, washed with water, with their yokes tightly bound 
but with no yoke-pins, are brought round from the;agnisal« and 
placed in the mahavedi, one about one cubit ( aratni ) to the 
south of the prs^hya line and the other to the north about one 
cubit The cart to the south ( called daksina-havirdh&na ) is 
larger than the one to the north and the shafts of both are 
towards the east. These carts are called havirdhana because 



2564. • For the oBtrSU Tide p. 984 above. 
H.D. 145 



1154 History of Dharmaiastra [ Oh. XXXIII 

the soma plant (which is the havis in somayaga) is to be placed 
thereon. ,MS The south and north carts are respectively in 
charge of the adhvaryu and pratiprasthatr. They are then 
covered with grass mats or thatch made of split bamboos. A 
mandapa ( called havirdh&na-mapdapa ) is erected by having 
six posts in front of the two carts and six behind them and 
having two bamboos on the posts from south to north. He 
suspends from the front part of the mandapa a garland-like 
sheaf of twisted grass (raratl). Various samskaras are performed 
on the axles of the carts by the wife and pratiprasthatr respec- 
tively. Detailed rules about covering the carts and similar 
matters are passed over ( Sp. XI. 7-8, Kat. VIII. 4 ). The 
havirdhSna mandapa is higher in the east than in the west and 
has two doors one to the east and the other to the west ( Sat. 
VII. 4. p. 701 ). No one is to take his meals or even to eat 
ids inside the havirdhana mandapa. The adhvaryu digs four 
round holes ( in two rows, two in eaoh row ) below the fore 
part of the shafts of the southern cart ( but not far from the 
axle ), each hole being about one span in diameter, being at 
a distance of one span from each and all being connected by 
cross-way subterranean passages. They are one arm deep. 
They are dug in such an order that the hole to the 
north-east is the last ( i. e. first south-east one is dug, then 
north-west one is dug, then south-west and then north-east 
or first north-west one, then south-east, then south-west and 
lastly north- east ). On these holes are spread kusa blades 
over which two wooden boards ( adbisavana-phalaka) are placed 
over whioh is spread the red skin of a bull (adhisavana- 
carma ), on which soma juice is extracted by means of four 
stones. These holes add to the noise of the stones by the sound 
reverberating through them and they are therefore called 
uparava. w * Jai. ( XI. 4. 52-53 ) states that the mantra ' rakso- 
hano ' is to be repeated at each time when a hole is dug and 
not only once for all holes. The adhvaryu and the saorificer

( uparavas ).

insert their right hands in the holes ( the adhvaryu inserting 
his hand in the south-east hole and the sacrificer in the north- 
west and then a second time the adhvaryu inserts his hand in 
the south-west hole and the sacrificer in the north-east ) and 
touch each other's hands and adhvaryu asks ' sacrificer 1 what is 
there ? ; ' the sacrificer replies ' welfare ( or happiness ) ' and the 
adhvaryu in a low voice says ' may that belong to us both. * 
This is done twice ( Est. VIII. 5. 14-21 ). At the second time 
the yajamana asks ' adhvaryu ! what is there ? ', the adhvaryu 
replies ' welfare ' and the yajamana says ' let it be mine. * The 
uparavas are sprinkled with water beginning from the south- 
east one and ending with the north-east one with a mantra 
( ' raksohano &o. ' Vaj. S. V. 25, Tai. S. L 3. 2 ). Then the rest 
of the proksanl water is poured into them, kusas are spread 
over their bottoms as in the hole of the yupa ( described, above ), 
a golden piece is placed thereon and offering of ajya is made. 
To the east of the uparavas or of the adhisavana-carma or of 
the upastambhana" ,T a four-cornered mound (khara) is made for 
keeping the soma vessels on with the earth ( dug up from the 
uparavas) that is sprinkled with water and mixed with sand. In 
front of this mound sufficient space is left to move about in the 
havirdhana mandapa. To the west of the utkara at a distance 
of six prakramas ( which comes to about the middle of the north 
side of the great altar ) is prepared the shed for Sgnldhra, which 
is half inside and half outside the great vedi, which has four 
posts and the beams of which run from west to east, which has 
a door to the south and is covered on all sides with mats. This 
shed is so made that its west side would be a continuation of 
the end of the western side of the havirdhana mandapa and this 
shed is a square having sides of five aratnis each ( com. on Kat. 
VIII. 6. 13). The sadas is measured at a distanoe of three 
prakramas from the western side of the great vedi to its east 
and has its length from south to north. The width of the sadas 
is nine aratnis ( or half of its length ) and its length ( from 
south to north ) 27 aratnis or as much as would be necessary 
for allowing room to all the priests, their dhisnyas ( seats ) and 
the prasarpakas (assistants and spectators). In the midst of 
the sadas a post of udumbara is fixed whioh is of the height of 
the sacrificer above its pit and which is placed at a distance of 
one prakrama to the south of the prstfiya. All samskSras that 



2567. Upastambhana is a prop made of two upright staffs held to- 
gether by a rope on whioh the front portion of a cart might rest. 



1156 History of Dharmaiastra [ Oh. XXXIII 

are made on the yupa and its pit are made in the case of this 
post ezoept those referring to iakala ( vide p. 1115 above ). The 
udumbara post has an ear-like protuberance towards the east when 
it is fixed in the pit. On that protuberanoe a gold pieoe is offered 
with the juhu and ajya is poured on in such a way that some 
of it will triokle to the ground. This audumbarl is thioker 
than any post of the sadas. The posts on the borders of the 
sadas are as high as the navel of the yajamana towards its 
sides, but in the middle they are as high as the audumbarl 
post. On the posts of the sadas beams are plaoed running 
from south to north and west to east. The middle of one 
third of this is covered with three mats that have their ends 
to the north, and then to the south and north of the middle 
portion three mats ( on each side ) are placed in suoh a way 
that their ends are turned towards the audumbarl post. The 
sadas is oovered with nine mats in all that are well sewn 
together. The sadas is surrounded by soreens and it has two 
doors to the east and west (just as the havirdhfina pavilion has ). 
Some prepare the sadas first and then the uparavas or vice versa 
( A p. XI. 10. 19 ). The doors of the prSgvarhsa, the sadas and 
havirdhana are so arranged ( opposite each other ) that a person 
sitting in one of these can see into all. Then eight dhisnyas 
( seats ) are to be prepared. The first is made in the agnldhra 
shed in its middle in such a manner that between it and the 
north side of the great vedi some space will be left for moving 
about. Six more dhisnyas are to be made in the sadas. The 
earth for all these dhisnyas is taken from the catvala pit. 
The six seats are made in the eastern portion of the sadas 
leaving between them and the eastern side of the sadas suffi- 
cient space to move about. The earth is spread on the seats 
by the adhvaryu who faces the north when preparing all the 
seats ( except two ) and who is touohed by the sacrificer with 
the sphya. Over the earth sand or gravel is spread on all 
the seats. Out of the six seats the adhvaryu facing the west 
makes the seat for the hotr to the north of the prsthyS line but 
touching it about one prakrama from the eastern door of the 
sadas (or on the prsthyS line itself, according to 5.p. XI. 14. 4), 
Then four more seats are made to the north of the seat of the 
hotr in order for brahmanaooharhsin, potr, nest? and aoohavaka 
respectively, eaoh of which is at the same distance from the 
next and the seat of the aoohavaka is ( four angulas ) larger 
than those of the rest. The seats are either square or round 
( aooording to Sat VIL 7. p. 723) and of 18 angulas in diameter 



Oh. XXXIII ] Agni$toma-dhiwya» 1157 

or on each side, and at the distance of one cubit or 18 angulas 
from each other ( com. on Eat. VIIL 6. 22 ). To the south of 
the note's dhisnya, the adhvaryu with his faoe to the north 
prepares at a distance of i\ aratnis from the hotr seat the seat 
for maitr&varuna (or prasSstr ), which seat is also to the south- 
east of the audumbarl post. The seat of maitravaruna is pre- 
pared immediately after hotr's Beat. These seven priests viz. 
agnldhra to maitravaruna are called the 'seven hotrs' in soma- 
yaga according to Tai. Br. II. 3. 6 and Sayana thereon, but 
Asv. I. 2. 26 seems to be opposed to this. Outside the eadas 
just opposite the agnldhra shed to the south is prepared the 
marjallya s$ls shed which is half inside the great vedi and half 
outside to the south and in the midst there is the marjallya 
seat made by the adhvaryu facing the south. The marjallya 
shed has a door facing the north. When all these several 
sheds and seats are got ready the adhvaryu and spectators have 
to enter and leave the great vedi by a route between the cat- 
vala pit and the utkara or between the catvala and the agnl- 
dhra shed and according to some on the day on whioh soma is 
pressed spectators may move about anywhere (Ap. XL 13. 
10-11 ). 

On the uparavas slender kusas with tips to the east or 
north are spread and over them are kept two boards (of udumbara 
or palasa or karsmarya wood ) called adhisavana-phalaka M,8a 
between which there is a space of two angulas ( towards the 
west ) whioh are one aratni long, are washed with water, their

soma stalks are to be crushed and round it the four stones ( called grK- 
ran ) are placed, the grSrans being one span long and big and ao taper- 
ing as to allow easy beating of soma stalks. 



1158 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XXXIII 

eastern face being curved like the board of a wheel and the 
western face being straight. In modern practice the boards 
are not curved on the east, but are straight. The wood is dry 
and well planed. In sacrifices in which soma is pressed on 
more days than one the boards are grooved and made to fit in 
each other and pierced with a nail. The boards are made firm 
by driving two pegs through them in front, two behind and one 
each to the north and south ( so that they will not recede )• 
Vide Baud. VI. 28. The spaoe of two fingers between the two 
is filled with the dust dug out from the uparavas. One board 
is placed on the two southern uparavas and the other on the 
two northern ones. On the two boards is placed a hide ( called 
adhisavana-carma ), which is red and cut up all round to fit in 
with the boards, with the neck portion to the east and the hairy 
portion up. On the hide are placed four stones ( gravan ) for 
pressing soma juice. The adhvaryu then issues directions to 
spread barhis over the great vedi ( except the uttaravedi, the 
khara, uparavas and dhisnyas, Sat. VII. 7. p.727) and for making 
the saorifioer take only one-fourth of the fast milk on whioh he 
is to subsist (according to Kat. VIII. 6. 30, half of the milk ). 
Then begins the procedure of the sacrifice of an animal to Agni 
and Soma ( jointly ). This is on the same lines as the nirudha- 
pasubandha which has already been described. The various 
actions such as paristarana, placing the sacrificial patras, pro- 
ksana are gone through. One more ladle called pracaranl made of 
vikantaka wood and resembling a juhu isused in addition (Ap.XI. 
16. 6). The pratiprasthatr (or nestr according toSat. VII,8,p.736) 
brings the wife from her usual plaoe (the patnlsSla). Thesacri- 
ficer's near relatives who always share the same roof are called. 
The yajamana touches the adhvaryu, the wife touches the sacri- 
ficer, the sons and brothers of the sacrificer touch the wife. They 
are all covered with a fresh piece of cloth and the adhvaryu offers 
with the pracaranl offerings of ajya called Vaisarjina "" to 
Soma ( Kat. VIII. 7. 1, Ap. XL 16. 15 ). Then comes the carry- 
ing forward ( pranayana ) of Agni and Soma. Fire is kindled 
on the shavanlya and is carried to the uttaravedi. Numerous 
utensils and vessels are taken to the great vedi beyond the sadas 
for use in the animal sacrifice and in the pressing of soma next 

2569. According to the Sat. Br. III. 6. 3. 2 the Vaisarjina offerings 
•re so called because by them he sets free all ( from the root ' srj ' with 
«Ti»).

day and kept in proper places.** 10 Fire is established in the 
Sgnldhra dhisnya. The soma stalks are taken to the havirdh&na 
mandapa and placed in the southern cart ( havirdh&na ) on a 
black antelope skin. The sacrificer consigns the soma to the 
care of gods with a mantra ' Ood Savitr 1 here is thy soma ' 
( Vaj. S. V. 39, Tai. S. I. 3. 4. 2 ). Then the yajamSna gives up 
the intermediate dlksa after offering into the ahavanlya a 
samidh with the mantra ' Agne vratapate ' ( Tai. S. I. 2. 11. It 
Vaj. S. V. 40 ) i. e. he loosens his girdle and his fists ( that so 
far had been clenched ), gives up the vow of silence ( to be 
observed at both sandhyfis ) and his fast food and he hands over 
his staff to maitravaruna ( Ap. XL 18. 6 ). He may on the next 
day ( soma pressing day ) partake of soma and the leavings of 
sacrificial food. Hereafter he may be addressed by name and 
food prepared in his house may be taken by others (Kat, VIII. 7. 
22 ). Then the sacrifice of the animal to Agni and Soma takes 
place ( of the omentum, the pasupurodasa and havis ). .Tai- 
after a lengthy discussion (VI. 8. 30-43) holds that this pasu must 
be a chaga (a goat). Jai. ( VIII. 1. 12 ) states that the procedure 
of darsa-purnamSsa is followed in this animal sacrifice and not 
of soma sacrifice. Vide also Jai. VIII. 2. 10-14. Animal sacrifice 
has already been described above ( pp. 1109-1131 ); but there 
are a few points of difference between the nirudha-pasubandha 
and the agnlsomlya pasu offered the day previous to the soma* 
pressing day ; viz. the svaru is not offered into fire in the latter 
nor is the heart-spit discharged. According to Jai. III. 7. 43-45 
the maitravaruna is the priest where praisa and anuvakya are 
to be uttered ( ordinarily the praisa is given by adhvaryu and 
the anuvakya is uttered by hotr. ). When the omentum is 
offered a direction is issued to the subrahmanya priest to chant 
the subrahmanya' 1 " 1 litany for inviting Indra in which the 
sacrificer is described as the son, grandson and great-grandson 
of so and so and as the father and grandfather of so and so

( vide note 2550 above ). Hereafter wherever the subrahmanyS 
is to be recited it is in this form. The agnlsomlya rite ends with 
the Patnlsamyaja ( Sat. VII. 8. p. 757 ). When the subrahmanyS 
call has been made, standing with his face to the west he brings 
in a jar the water from a flowing river that starts from a 
mountain," 78 but he should not pass over a river that is near 
his place, even if it does not start from a mountain. He takes

river where the shadow of a cloud and sunshine meet or ( if 
that is not possible ) in the shadow of one's own body or of 
a tree or of the river bank. He should fill the jar with 
water against the stream with 'havismatlr* (Vaj. S. VI. 23 t 
Tai. 8. 1. 3. 12. 1 ). Sat. Br. IIL 9. 2. 8-9, Kat. VIII. 9. 8-10 
and A.p. XI. 20. 10-12 suggest other alternative sources for 
the water. He enters with the jar of vasatlvarl water 8 * 78 by 
the path between the utkara and catvala, takes it by the 
north of the agnldhra shed, enters the sala by the eastern 
door and places the jar to the west of the salamukhlya 2 "* 
fixe. In the second watch of the night the adhvaryu carries 
the jar of vasatlvarl waters on his shoulder and takes it round 
the altar and fires in several ways (minutely described in 
Ap. XI. 21. 3-5, Sat. VII. 8. p. 759 and Kat. VIIL 9. 18-23 ). 
At that time only the saorificer and his wife are allowed to 
stay inside and all others have to go out. Ultimately the 
vasatlvarl jar is placed in the agnldhra shed (Ap. XI. 21. 5, 
Kat VIII. 9. 23 ) and the soma plant also is placed in the same 
hut but on the asandl (a large stool or couch). The saori.

ftgnldhra shed and no one is to stay in the sadas. That night 
the pratiprasthStr draws milk in the evening for the payasyft 
( amiksa ) to be offered to Mitra and Varuna the next day and 
the adhvaryu issues orders to milk the cows that yielded the 
fast milk for the saorificer and his wife for making respectively 
from their milk aiir ( i. e. soma mixed with milk ) and for the 
graha (cup) of ourds ( dadhi ) and to milk the cow that 
yielded the milk in the pravargya rite for dadhigharma ,,w 
(a warm beverage made with inspissated milk) and for the 
milk that will be heated but not mixed with butter milk ( to be 
offered) to Mitra and Varuna and boiled milk mixed with 
butter milk and brought to the state of curds for the Aditya 
graha ( cup ). The priests deck themselves with ornaments and 
fine olothes and stay for the night in the agnldhra shed. 

The last day ( generally the 5th day ) is called * sutya * ( on 
which soma is pressed). The priests are awakened sometime 
after midnight long before dawn in order to be able to finish all 
actions up to upamiu ( i.e. the extracting of Soma with up&rhsu 
stone before sunrise, com. on Ap. XII. 1. 1 ). Then the adhvaryu 
sips water and invokes the agnldhra shed, the havirdhSna shed, 
the sadas shed, the sruc ladles and vessels called v&yavya ( that 
are contracted in the middle like a mortar, are one span in 
length and have a bowl on the upper part, Ap. XII. 1. 4 ). The 
adhvaryu makes 33 offerings of ajya called yaj&atanu in the 
agnldhriya fire with mantras (from Tai. S. IV. 4.9.1). The 
various w * pStras are plaoed on the khara (mound), the up&rh-

supatra on the south corner of the eastern side of the great vedi 
and the antarySmapatra on the north corner and between the two 
the grSvan (stone) called upariisusavana (employed in extracting 
soma). Ap. (XII. 1. 6-XII. 2. 13 ), 6at. ( VIIL 1, pp. 770-777 ), 
and Eat. IX. 2 describe at great length how and where the 
numerous patras required on this day are placed. According to 
Kat. IX. 2. 1 the unnetr priest arranges the patras. Then pre- 
parations are made for the savanlya pasu (the animal to be 
killed and offered on the day of the pressing of soma ) on the 
lines of the agnlsomlya pasu offered the previous day. Then 
so early before dawn that birds have not begun to chirp or 
men to speak the adhvaryu issues directions, to the hotr to 
recite the prataranuvaka ( morning prayer ) in honour of the 
gods that come early in the morning ( viz. Agni, Usas and 
the Asvins), to the brahma priest to observe silence, to the 
pratiprasthatr to take out the materials (nirvapa) for 
the savanlya cake and to the subrahmanya to recite the 
subrahmanya litany (he will use the word B *adya suty&m ' 
in the formula ) and promises the hotr that he (the adhvaryu ) 
will follow the hotr mentally in the latter's recitation. The 
hot? sits down between the yokes of the two havirdhana carts 
and recites the prataranuvaka in three parts ( oalled h-atu ), 
the first for Agni, the second for Usas, and the third for the 
Asvins. B57T In eaoh part he has to repeat at least one hymn in 
each of the seven metres viz. Gayatrl, Anusfabh, Trisfabh, 
BrhatI, Uspih, JagatI and Pahkti. Asv. ( IV. 13. 6— IV. i5. 3 ) 
states the hymns to be recited, the minimum being at least 
one hundred rks. If all the hymn 9 and verses specified 
by Asv. are recited the total of the Agneya section will 
be over 1324 ( out of which verses in Gayatrl are 320, in 
Tristubh 591 and only one hymn, $g. V. 6 of 10 verses, is in 
Fankti metre ). 



2577. In %. V. 77. 1 the As>ins are called ' pr5tar-y 5vBn8 ' ( early 
coming ). Vide Ait. Br. VII. 6 ' (ft *r* ^r: *mf*r>it *nrft**r wP*f>

hymns because they are addressed to some other deity or because they 
are in another metre than the one required. For example, in %. 
VIIL 11 the last verse is in Tritfubh and to it is omitted in the Gayatrl 
group ; similarly in %. X. 8 the last three Trittubh verses are omitted 
M they are addressed to Indra. 



Ch. XXXIII ] Agni§toma-Pralaranuwlka 1163 

About 250 verses 8 " 8 are set out by Asv. for being recited 
' in the Usas kratu and about 407 in the Asvina kratu of the 
pr&taranuv&ka ( in all about 2000 verses i. e. nearly one-fifth 
of the whole of the Qgveda ). The pr&taranuv&ka is to be 
recited in the low or base ( mandra ) scale ( is v. IV. 13. 6 ). 
Asv. further directs that even when the minimum of 100 verses 
or any number short of the one prescribed by him are recited, 
the order of the hymns set out by him is to be followed and 
that the three hymns Eg. VII. 12 (to Agni in Tristubh), 

VII. 73 (to Asvins in Tristubh) and I. 112 (to Asvins 
in JagatI ) are called mangala ( auspioious ) and that if the 
darkness of night is still there when he is about to finish the 
prfttaranuv&ka he should go on repeating Rg. 1. 112 till sun- 
light appears ( Asv. IV. 15. 7 and 9 ). 

While the Pr&taranuv&ka is being recited by the hotr, the 
ftgnldhra ( according to Kat. IX. 1. 15, the pratiprasth&tr accord, 
ing to Ap. XII. 4. 4 ) priest takes out materials ( nirvSpa ) for 
five offerings whioh are a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, 
dh&n& ( fried barley ) for two Haris ( bay horses of Indra ), 
Karambha (barley flour with curds) for Pusan, curds for 
SarasvatI, payasy& for Mitra and Varuna. There is an option 
that all five are meant for Indra, but the last four are in that 
case to Indra associated with the other deities in order as shown 
below.'"* The adhvaryu aBks the hotr to think of water and is- 
sues directions to the attendant of maitra varuna holding a mai- 
tr& varuna camasa (a flat wooden dish or cup with a handle ) that 
he should come with the adhvaryu, to the nesfr to fetch the wife 
or wives of the saorifioer, asks the other rtviks to hold the 
ekadhana pitchers and the agnldhra to wait near the oatv&la

lake, makes offerings of ajya with the oamasa of maitravaruna, 
fills it with water, the ekadhana pitchers also are filled and the 
wife fills a vessel called pannejana or pSnnejana" 80 ( a small 
vessel with water for washing the feet or thighs ). While the 
ekadhana pitohers are being filled the hotr recites Bg. X. 30. 
1-9 and 11 which are oalled ' aponaptrlya verses ' as the deity 
of those verses is ' apamnapat ' ( vide Ait. Br. VIII. 2, Asv. V. 1. 
8 and 8. B. E. vol. 26. p. 232 n. 2 ).' m Then the water in the 
maitravaruna oamasa and the vasatlvarl waters are mixed up 
together. And placing the vasatlvarl water in the hotrcamasa 
the adhvaryu hands the camasa to the saorificer, which water 
is thence-forward called nigrabhya ( Ap. XII. 9. 1 ). Then the 
adhvaryu makes an offering of ourds from a cup ( called dadhi- 
graha, Ap. XII. 7. 5-7 ). He also takes a few soma stalks from 
the heap of soma, places them on the upara ( vide note 2582 ) and 
pours some vasatlvarl water over them, beats the stalks with the 
stone, extracts soma juice, fills a oup with it and offers it ( this 
is oalled somagraha, Ap. XII. 7. 10-12 ). Ap. XII. 9 and Kat. 
IX 4 describe how Boma is extraoted to fill the Upam^ugraha 
by using the Nigrabhya water, a portion of it is offered in 
the southern part of fire ( the tyaga is * idam suryaya * ) 
and a portion is kept in the Agrayanasthall and a large 
ooil of soma stalks is placed in the Upamsugraha for use in 
the evening pressing. Vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 489 and 
S.B. E. vol. 26 pp. 244-245 n. 2 for the method of the pressing 
of soma for upSrhsu-graha ( they slightly differ ). Then comes 
the mahabhisava (the great or principal pressing of soma). 
The adhvaryu goes near the Adhavanlya trough and pours into 
it all the water that is in the maitravaruna camasa and a third 
part of the vasatlvarl water also is poured in that trough 
and also of the ekadhana water. The rest of both kinds of 
waters is kept in the place of the ekadhana water ( viz. to 
the west of the axle of the northern havirdhlna and below 
it ). The adhvaryu sits to the north of the adhisavana-carma 
towards the east and behind him sits the saorificer, to 
the south of the adhisavana-oarma sits the pratiprasthatr, 
to the west nesfr and to the north the unnetr ( Ap. XII. 12. 2

that very day (oom. on Asv. V. 1. 9.)

and Sat. VIII. 3. p. 825 ). A very large portion of the soma 
stalks is to be taken for the morning pressing and a small 
one for the midday one ( Ap. XII. 9. 7). The adhvaryu takes 
hold of the Btone called ttpara, " 8 * places it on the adhiaavana 
hide, brings soma stalks thereon, nigrabhya water is poured on 
them, the stalks are beaten by the priests with the other stones 
held in their right hands, which have a golden ring or the 
like. This is called the first turn or round ( paryaga ). Then 
there is a second turn, when the stalks of soma soattered about 
in the first beating are oollected and are again pounded. Then 
there is a third turn. The texts even prescribe how many times 
the stalks are to be beaten in each turn ( vide Ap. XII. 10. 4-8, 
9 and XII. 12. 8-9). The wet and pounded stalks are collected 
by the adhvaryu into a vessel called sambharanl, " 8J are put 
in the adhavanlya trough which already oontains water, the 
adhavanlya contents are thoroughly stirred, the stalks are 
washed, pressed, then taken out and placed on the adhisavana- 
carma. The four stones are again placed faoing the upara ( the 
central big stone ), the sediment or dregs ( rjlsa ) ,SM of the 
soma stalks are put over the face of the stones. The 
dronakalasa ( a big trough ) is carried from its place and kept 
over all the stones by the udgatr priests, who spread over it a 
woollen strainer or sieve held on a wooden frame or stool with 
its hem to the north and its oentre ( nabhi ) made of the bunoh 
of wool that was handed over to the sacrificer when soma was 
purchased (Ap. X. 26. 11 and XII. 13. 1). The unnetr priest takes 
in a vessel (camasa) the soma liquid from the adhavanlya trough, 
pours it into the hotroamasa containing nigrabhya water held 
by the sacrificer, who pours a continuous stream on to the 
woollen strainer ( from the hotroamasa ). From the stream of 
soma juice flowing down from the strainer all cups ( that are 
wooden ) up to the dhruva oup are filled, the first being the cup 
called antaryama. The soma that falls in the dronakalasa is 
called sukra ( Kat. IX 5. 15 ). The Up&rhsu cup is offered 
before sunrise, while the adhvaryu offers the antaryama 
oup when the sun rises ( Ap. XII. 13. 12 ). The cups filled

are Aindravayava, Maitravaruna, Sukra, Manthin, Agrayana, 
Ukthya, Dbruva and tbey are placed on various spots of the 
mound ( khara ) described at p. 1155 above. As the cups are 
filled from the stream ( dhara ) they are called dharagrahas 
( com. on Eat. IX. 6. 26 ). The cups are wiped with the hems 
of the strainer or another strainer is employed for the purpose 
( Ap. XII. 14. 10-11 ). In the oase of the maitravaruna cup the 
contents are mixed with boiled but cooled milk, those of the 
manthin with barley flour. The three grahas vis. Agrayana, 
Ukthya and Dhruva are filled to the brim. He then fills three 
cups called attgrahyas for Agni, Indra and Surya ( Ap. XII. 15. 9, 
only in Agnisfama and not in other soma sacrifices ). After 
the cups are filled, the dronakalasa trough is half filled with 
soma juice, then the stream of soma stops ( Ap. XII. 16. 9, Eat. 
IX. 6. 26 ), all fluid from the woollen strainer is wrung out into 
the dronakalasa and the strainer is kept aside. Then he pours 
from the maitravaruna oamasa whioh is filled with ekadhanft 
waters into the ftdhavanlya trough as muoh as would be necessary 
(for filling all soma vessels in the morning pressing) ; he spreads 
the strainer with its hem to the north on the mouth of the 
putabhrt trough, pours thereon a portion of the soma juice that 
is in the ftdhavanlya trough and then touches all the three 
troughs with distinct mantras ( Ap. XII. 16. 11 ). Then the 
adhvaryu, prastotr.pratihartr.udgatr, the brahma (being the last) 
oome out of the havirdhana shed touohing each other with the 
right hand in the order stated ( T&ndya Br. VI. 7. 12, 
Ap. XII. 17. 1 ), adhvaryu being. the first (some give a slightly 
different order ). They perform ( or according to Eat. the 
adhvaryu alone performs) what are called ' viprud-dhomas \ ,IM 
When the soma is being pressed drops of it are scattered about. 
In order to make these drops go to the gods and also as a sort 
of expiation this offering of Sjya is made to Soma ( in all the 
three savanas). Then the five priests touohing each other 
( adhvaryu being the leader, brahma being the last and the 
sacrificer touching him ) oreep with heads bent in a stealthy 
manner (like hunters pursuing a deer, according to Ap. XII.

permission of the brahmft priest 'shall we chant* (and also of 
MaitrSvaruna, aooording to Asv. V. 2. 11 ) and he replies 'yen, 
do chant* (after repeating in the morning pressing 'bhur-

one employed here being the first viz. ' rasmirasi ' ( thou art a

then gives permission. All pavamana ohants are introduced 
in this manner ( i. e. by giving a handful of kusas to the 
prastotr &o. ). In the case of stotras other than pavamana, 
the adhvaryu makes the chanters start after giving them two 

kusa blades with 'asarji upavartadhvam *. At the time 

of chanting the bahte pavamana 2m stotra, the priests and sacri- 
ficer sit inside the vedi not far from the catvfila pit in a certain 
order and look at the catvala or they sit round the northern 
shoulder of the vedi. The udgatr sits facing the north, the 
prastotr sits facing the west and the pratihartr faces the south-

the pratiprasthstr and the sacrificer sits to the south of these. 1587 " 
They sit placing their right foot on the left thigh, look at the 
horizon and hold their mouths straight ( neither hanging down 
nor up-lifted). This is the position of the chanters in all 
stotras (La^. I. 11. 18-23). Then the prastotr, udgatr and

1168 History of DharmaiMra [ Oh. XXXIII 

The Bahispavamftna of sacrifices lasting for more than one day 
is chanted in the sodas except on the first day (vide Drahyayana 
Sr. IV. 1. 13 ). The sacrificer and at least four of the other 
priests ( hut not adhvaryu ) act as choristers ( upagStr, Ap. XII. 
17. 11-12). According to La}. L 11. 26 and Drahy&yana IIL 4. 6 
the priests sing the ononis 'ho' and the sacrificer Bays ' om ' 
continuously in the mandra ( low ) tone in the intervals between 
the prast&va and the other elements of the ohant and also during 
the chanting of these elements except the nidhana, according to 
com. on Drahyayana III. 4. 6 and stop from doing so at the 
finale ( nidhana ) which is to be sung by the three sftma priests 
together. Jai. (III. 7. 30) states that the choristers are some 
of the prieBts (rfcviks) themselves ( except adhvaryu ) and not 
others. At the time of the first prast&va of the bahispavam&na 
chant, the ,s88 sacrificer mutters the famous prayer ( Bet out 

on p. 5 above) 'asato m5 sad gamaya mftmrtam gamaya' 

(Br. Up. I. 3. 28 and com. on Kat. IX. 7. 4 ), while according to 
Ap. XII. 17. 14 the sacrificer mutters the dasahotr texts ( vide 
p. 993 above for them )• The first stotra at each pressing is 
called Pavamana (Ap. XII. 17. 8-9), that at the morning savana 
being called Bahispavamana, those at the 2nd and 3rd pressings 
being respectively called M&dhyandina pavamana and Arbhava 
or Trtlya Pavamftna. The other stotras are called Dhurya 
(com. on Eat. IX. 14. 5). 

According to La^. 1. 12. 1 and Drahyayana Sr. III. 4. 16-17 
the prastotr takes the prastara bunch from the adhvaryu, asks 
the permission of the brahma and the prasSstr and then hands 
over the prastara to the udgatr who touches his thigh with it, 
and keeps it down with a yajus mantra.

The three sSman priests then commence the chanting 
• of the BahispavamSna atotra, while looking at the catvala 
(TftndyaVI. 7. 24). The verses in this stotra are nine, viz. 
Hg.IX. 11. 1-3, 1X64. 28-30 and Rg. IX. 66. 10-12; they 
correspond to Samaveda II. 1. 1. 1-3 (Benfey) and 8. V. 
vol. III. pp. 4-5, 7-8, 10-11. According to the com. on L&t. VI. 

10. 1 eaoh saman in a stotra has five parts called prastSva 
(preceded by 'hum' uttered by the saaian priests together), 
udgltha, pratihara, upadrava and nidhana (finale), which are 
respectively chanted by the prastotr, udgatr, pratihartr, udgatr, 
all the three together." 8 * According to Lat. I. 12. 7 the Bahia- 
pavamana is begun to be chanted after once uttering the 
syllable 'hum', while the udgltha in all cases begins with ' om '

St. itself illustrates ( in VII. 10. 18-21) how the first verse is 
chanted. The nidhanas for the nine verses are (L&t VII.

note below will, it is hoped, convey some idea ( however vague ) 
of the manner in which the sfiman verses are manipulated for 
the purpose of chanting. It is very difficult ( nay, almost 
impossible) to convey in print how the damans are sung. The 
difficulty is aggravated by the fact that the notations adopted 
in the mss. and the editions are different and hardly any two 
MSS. agree in all respects. ■ Besides the present writer does not 
profess to have studied the intricacies of ancient Indian or 
modern European music and is not in a position to write a 
dissertation on this topic. He has, however, given below and

from Sanskrit works. Those who are desirous of making a

' the Ancient Mode of singing samagana ' by Mr. Laksmana

here that even on reading these books no thorough knowledge 
of samaganas can be acquired. Thorough investigation and 
research have yet to be made in these gSnas and the first 
endeavour must be to oollect gramophone records of the methods 
of chanting adopted throughout India and then compare them. 
A generation or two henoe, it is feared, hardly any learned 
sama singers will be left. 

Most of the saman chants are taken from the Rgveda. In 
reciting a verse from the Rgveda attention has to be paid to the 
accents called udatta, anudatfca and svarita. When the same 
verse is chanted as a saman, one has to attend besides to the 
notes of the melody to which the verse is being sung. The 
way of marking the aooents of the Rgveda verse is not followed 
when it is taken in the SSmaveda. The svarita of the Rgveda 
is represented in the SSmaveda MS8. in several ways, but 
generally by the figure 2 written above the letter and anud&tta 
preceding an udatta is represented in the Samaveda samhiti 
by the figure 3 and udatta following an anudatta has the figure 
one placed on the letter. There are further detailed rules about 
these accents and also other marks which are not set out 
here. Only one further remark is made. The letter ' ra' 



1172 History of DharmaiUsira [ Ch. Xliltl 

preceded by 2 is placed over a svarita coming after the udatta 
which follows another udatta. Modern sSma singers have 
generally no knowledge of these ancient rules and signs but 
only chant as they learned from their teachers, nor do their chants 
always agree with the notations in the several MSS. Further there 
is a certain monotony and sameness in their melodies. If one 
hears a modern singer sing songs in several ragas like the Jogi 
or Jfunjoti or Khamach a person totally ignorant of the ragas can 
feel, however vaguely, the difference between the two. But this 
is not so when a Rathantara melody or a Brhat melody is sung. 
According to the Samavidhana-brahmana ( 1. 1. 8 and 14 ) these 
notes ( also called svaras) are seven, viz. krusta, prathama (1st), 
dvitlya ( 2nd ), trtlya, oaturtha, pancama ( or mandra ) and 
antya ( last ) or atisvarya. nn Sayana explains that the seven 
svaras named above are arranged in a descending scale, though 
from the words first, second and so on one is apt to suppose 
that they are in an ascending scale. Sayana further states 
that these seven svaras are also called yamas. 25M In the 
Naradlya-siksa ( Benares Sanskrit series ) the seven svaras are 
stated to be prathama, dvitlya, trtlya, caturtha, mandra, krusta 
and atisvara ( 1. 12 ). The krusta is the highest note and comes 
before prathama in many texts. The same work ( III. 5 ) 
mentions the seven classical notes, sadja, rsabha, gandhara, 
madhyama, pancama, dhaivata and nisada ( which are indi- 
cated in modern India as sa ri or re gamapa dha ni ). The 
N&radlya-siksa then (V. 1-2) tries to establish a correspondence 
between the seven ancient names of the notes of sama chanters 
and the seven notes of olassioal times by stating that the seven 
saman notes mentioned ( from prathama onwards ) are respec- 
tively the same as the notes produced on the Indian vlna ( lute ) 
called madhyama, gandhara, rsabha, sadja, dhaivata, nisada 
and pancama. Pandit Satavajekar ( Introduction to the edition 
of the Samaveda p. 2 ) holds that the printed Naradlya-siksa has

wrongly transposed the places of msSda and dhaivata. tiH 
The notations employed in the North Indian and South 
Indian MSS. of. the Samaveda vary considerably and the 
confusion is made worse by the fact that the several sikhfis 
(such as the Kauthumas, the Ranayanlyas and Jaiminlyas) 
have various readings and varying notations of their 
own. The Naradlya-siksS further points out (VI, 2-6) that 
the samans can be sung to the notes of the ordinary vlna and 
also to the accompaniment of the movemen ts of the thumb and 
fingers of the hand (and so it calls the latter g&travlna, 
' body-lute ' ), The reciter sitting cross-legged is to place his 
hands on the two knees, to touoh by the tip of the thumb the 
middle parva (joint) of the fingers for indicating the several notes 
of the song ( and not the root of the fingers ) and to hold the 
hand in front of his nose like a cow's ear. The seven svaras 
are indicated as follows ' iiH the krusta is on the head ( top ) 
of the thumb, the prathama ( i. e. madhyama of classical notes ) 
is on the central part of the thumb ; gandhara, rsabba, sadja 
and dhaivata ( i. e. 2nd, 3rd, 4th and mandra ) are respectively 
indicated by ( touching with the tip of the thumb the oentral 
joints of ) the fore-finger, the middle finger, the ring finger and 
the small finger; and nisada is indicated at that part of the 
palm below the small finger which resembles a channel when 
the fingers are closed in a fist. 

While the Bahispavamana is being chanted the unnetr 
priest pours the soma juice contained in the adhavanlya vessel 
on to the putabhrt trough over whioh the woollen strainer is 
stretched with its hem to the north. When the chant is finished 
the ad h vary u issues directions (praisa)to the agnldhra priest 
to kindle fires ( on the dhisnyas), to strew kusa grass ( on the 
vedi ) and to deck the purodasas and to the pratiprasthatr to 
come with the savaniya (to be sacrificed on the pressing day) 
pasu ( animal ). The agnldhra brings burning coals from the 
agnldhrlya fire and kindles fires on the dust (or sand) of the 
several dhisnyas beginning with that of thehotrfin the order in 
whioh the seats were arranged and with the same mantras ). The

agnldhra spreads kusas beginning from the garhapatya up to 
the ahavanlya, along the prethya line and decks the purod&sas. 
He offers soma into the ahavanlya, agnldhrlya and marj&llya 
fires and &jya in others. The adhvaryu, whom the saorificer 
touches, fills the Asvina cup ( graha ) from the dronakalasa 
with the pariplava ( a small spoon resembling a sruo without its 
rod, Ap. XII. 2. 7 ) and the other cups that are not dhar&grahas 
are also filled in the same way. 

Then begin the rites for the offering of the savanlya pasu, 
commencing from the tying of a triple girdle round the post 
( ynpa ). According to Kat. IX. 8. 1 the girdle ( rasana ) that 
was used the previous day at the time of sacrificing the Agnl- 
somlya animal is again used for the savanlya pasu, while 
according to Ap. XII. 18. 12 a new girdle is used. In the 
Agnisfcma the animal sacrificed on soma-pressing day is a goat 
for Agnl In the Ukthya sacrifice another goat ( in addition ) is 
sacrificed for Indra and Agni, in the Sodasin sacrifice a third pasu 
( a ram according to Kat. IX. 8. 4, a goat acoording to Ap. XII. 
18. 13 ) is offered in addition and in the Atiratra a fourth one 
(a goat) to SarasvatI in addition. Kat. (IX. 8. 5-6) allows 
optionally a ewe. These four animals that are offered are called 
stomayana (Eat. IX. 8. 7 ) and kratupaius ( As v. V. 3. 4). Then 
the procedure of Nirndhapasubandha described above is 
followed up to the offering of the vapa (omentum) and sub- 
sequent marjana (purification with water X Then all the 
priests and the saorificer enter the sadas and occupy places to 
the east of the audumbarl post and to the west of their several 
seats ( dhisnyas )"" and other places after looking ( with man- 
tras for each) at the several cups, the three troughs ( adhava- 
nlya, putabhrt and drona-kalasa), the clarified butter and vessels 
and the saorificer pays homage to all these (with mantras set 
out in Ap. XII. 19. 5 ff). 

At this stage the pratiprasthstr brings the five savanlya 
offerings ( vide p. 1163 above ). The adhvaryu places them on 
the vedi, outs off portions of the offerings, arranges them in one 
large vessel ( or the juhu ) in such a way that the cake for 
Indra is placed in the middle, the dh&na is to the east of it, 
karambha to the south, parivSpa to the west and SmiksS to the

north. The portions meant for svistakrt are placed in the 
Upabhrt. The adhvaryu issues his direction to the maitravaruna 
to recite the anuvSky a for the purod&sa and other offerings to 
Indra in the morning pressing and to ask the hotr to repeat the 
yajyS for the same. The anuv&kySs for the purod&sa and other 
offerings in the three savanas are respectively Rg. III. 52. 1, 5 
and 6 and the anuv&ky&s in the three savanas for the svistakrt 
offering are Rg. III. 28. 1. 4 and 5 respectively. The maitrS- 
varuna's praisa to the hotr and the latter's formula before the 
offering is made are given in the note below. ,5M The adhvaryu 
makes the principal offering into fire and then the svistakrt. 
Portions of the remainder are cut off for the Brahma priest, ida 
is cut off and placed on the seat of the hotr and the Test is kept 
securely for the sacrificer. 

Then offerings of soma from the cups are made to the joint 
deities ( dvidevatya grahas ) viz. for Indra and Vayu, Mitra and 
Varuna, and the two Asvins. After this comes camasonnayana. 
The unnetr fills to the west of the uttaravedi nine camams for 
the priests called oamasadhvaryus, by first pouring in each 
Borne soma from the dronakalasa ( this is upastarana ), then 
soma from the putabhrt trough and then again from the 
dronakalasa ( this is abhigharana ). The order in which the 
nine are filled is : first that of hotr, then for brahma, udg&tr, 
sacrificer, maitravaruna, brahmanacoharhsin, potr, nesfc, agnl- 
dhra ( there is none for unnetr and acohavaka here ). The 
maitravaruna repeats $g. 1. 16, VII. 21 and IV. 35 in the three 
savanas respectively when the camasas are being filled ( Asv. 
V. 5. 14 ). Then follows iukrdmanthi-praaira. The adhvaryu 
takes the soma cup called Sukra, the pratiprasth&tr the Manthin 
cup and the oamasadhvaryus the camasas that are placed on the 
uttaravedi. The camasadhvaryus are not rtviks chosen by the 
yajamlna but they are assistants chosen by the priests (the rtviks 
themselves). Vide Jai III. 7. 27. Jai. (III. 7. 26-27) further says

that they are generally ten. They ( adhvaryu and pratipras- 
thatr) cover the cups with two pieces of wood (chiselled off when 
the yupa was made ) that are sprinkled with holy water, wipe 
the cups from their mouths downwards with two pieces ( of the 
yupa, but not sprinkled ) saying ' wiped off is Sanda ' ( adhvaryu 
says) and 'wiped off is Marka' (says pratiprasthatr). They place 
the cups on the south and north corners of the western side of 
the uttaravedi.go to the south and north of the yupa, throw away 
the unsprinkled chips (referring to the repulse of Sanda and 
Marka ) 9S>7 outside the vedi and the sprinkled ones are placed 
into the ahavanlya and standing on both sides of the yupa they 
two offer the cups with their faces to the west and the cama- 
sadhvaryus ( who are nine here and ten in other cases, vide 
com. on Kat. IX. 11. 2 ) do the same with faces to the east and 
silently. All these offerings are made to Indra ( com. on Kat. 
IX 11. 2). The pratiprasthatr pours what remains in the 
manthin cup into the sukra cup and the adhvaryu pours the 
mixture of the soma juice remnants of the two cups into the 
hotr-camasa. The adhvaryu directs attendants to refill the oups 
of the maitrftvaruna, brahmanao-charhsin, potr, nes(r and 
agnldhra with soma from the dronakalasa and the contents are 
offered into fire respectively for Mitra and Varuna, Indra, 
Maruts, Tvastr, Agni. Then the hotr, adhvaryu and prati- 
prasthatr partake of the remnants of the contents of the cups 
offered to the double deities (Indra and Vayu, Mitra and Varuna, 
the two Asvins ). Vide Ap. XII. 25. 13. A keen controversy is 
carried on in the sutras whether the adhvaryu or hotr drinks 
first. Vide Ap. XII. 24. 6, Kat. IX. 11. 12-17. The contents 
of the oup for Indra- vayu . are drunk twice and of the rest 
once. The mantra in all cases of the drinking of soma 
by the priests is ' vagdevl jusanS somasya trpyatu saha 
pranena svaha' (Vaj. S. VIII. 37, Ap. XII. 24. 11. 12, Kat. IX. 11. 
19, Asv. V. 6. 22). The remnants in the cups are poured into hotr- 
camasa. Then a very small part of the purodasa is thrown 

2597. It is rather strange that Prof. A. B. Eeitb says (in 'Religion 
and Philosophy of the Veda ' part 2 p. 329 ) ' then are filled the goblets 
of the priests and offerings of the dukra and manthin cups mado for tho 
strange figures of Sanda and Marka'. As shown above the offerings of 
sukra and manthin were made to Indra. Baud. VII. 14 says ww^grtf

into the aindra-vayava oup by the adhvaryu, a portion of the 
.payasya in the maitrSvaruna cup and the dhana in the Ssvina 
oup. Vide Jai. III. 8. 33 ( where it is said that this effects 
a sarhskara of the purodSsa &o). The pratiprasthatr then 
keeps these cups on the northern wheel-track of the southern 
havirdhana cart. The adhvaryu and other priests make an 
offering of Vajina ( Est. IX. 12. 1 ). The several priests drink 
soma from their camasas ( in a rather complicated manner, for 
which vide com. on Est. IX. 12. 3 and Ap. XII. 25. 16-23). The 
hotr drinks once from all camasas and twice from his own 
camasa, the maitravaruna and other priests drink from their 
own camasas twice ( Ap. XII. 25. 19-21 ). nn On drinking, 
soma the priests touch their mouth and heart with Rg. VIII. 
48. 3-4 * we drank soma and have become immortal &c.' Vide 
Asv. V. 8. 26. All the camasas are then strengthened or reple- 
nished ( apyayana ) by the priests by repeating two mantras 
' apyayasva* & . ( $ g . j. 91. 16 and 18 = VSj. S. XII. 112-113, 
Tai. S. III. 2. 5. 3 ) and by filling them with soma from the 
putabhrt trough and then they are placed under the southern 
havirdhana oart to the west of the axle and are thence-forward 
called Nar&ssmsa till the taking up of the Vaisvadeva cup 
(Ap. XII. 25. 24-27, Kat. IX. 15. 5-8 ). The adhvaryu takes 
a small portion of the purodasa and while giving it to the 
acohavSka priest who sits outside the sadas in front of the seat 
( dhisnya ) prepared for him says ' acchavaka, say whatever 
you have to say.* The acchavaka holding the portion on a level 
with his mouth recites the three verses, Rg. V. 25. 1-3 ( accha 
vo agnimavase &c). He combines the 'om' uttered at the end of 
the third verse with a long prose formula S59, (nigada) which ends 
with 'O brahmana ! call us who are brahmanas '. The adhvaryu

recites Rg. VI. 42 and a oamasa is filled for him first with soma 
from the dronakalasa, then from the putabhrt trough and again c 
from the dropakalasa. After the aochavaka recites Rg. VIII. 38.7 
( as the yajya ) the adhvaryu makes an offering of soma from 
his oamasa in the ahavanlya, the aochavaka lays down the 
piece of purod&sa and Bitting on his own seat drinks the re- 
mainder of soma himself from his oamasa and also eats the 
portion of purodasa given to him (As v. V. 7. 7 and 9). His 
camasa is then placed among the other camasas. 

After the aochavaka sits down, the brahmft, hotr, adhvaryu, 
maitravaruna and agnldhra partake of the ids of the savanlya 
cake and the other four offerings in the agnldhra shed ( Ap, 
XII. 25. 8-15, Asv. V. 7. 10, Kat. IX 11. 29 and IX. 12. 16 ). 
The saorificer also partakes of it and the wife partakes of light 
food ( rice &o.) in her shed (Kat. IX. 12. 16-17, com. on Ap. 
XII. 25. 12). Ap. (XII. 25. 13) states that at this time take 
place several of the acts that are done in the darsapurnamasa 
suoh as throwing the sakha on fire, the offering of vajina, the 
two homas of piatalepa and phallkarana &o. 

Then comes the offering of rtugrahas. These cups are filled 
from the dronakalasa and are offered by the adhvaryu and the 
pratiprasthatr to the twelve months ( Madhu, Madhava, and so 
on, from Tai. S. I. 4. 14 or Vaj. S. VII. 30 ) or 13 months ( when 
there is an interoalary month called Samsarpa in Tai. S. I. 4. 
14. 1 and Amhasaspati in Vaj. 8. VII. 30 ) or 14 ( vide Ap. XIL 
27. 1 ). There are 6 pairs of months, for the first of which the 
offering is made by the adhvaryu and for the 2nd by the prati- 
prasthatr with the mantra (Vaj S. VII. 30) * upayfimagrhltosi 
madhave tva* (and so on). Baud. VII. 16 gives at length all 
the mantras for the twelve months. The praisas are uttered by 
the maitravaruna and when the adhvaryu enters the havir- 
dhfina pavilion to make the offering the pratiprasthatr leaves 
it and vice versa. The vasa^kara for the first six is uttered 
respectively by hotr, potr, nesft, agnldhra, brahmanScchamsin 
and maitravaruna and the adhvaryu or pratiprasthatr ( as the 
case may be ) eats of the remains in the cup with that priest 
who utters the vasatk&ra. In the next four the vasatkSra is 
uttered by hot?, potr, nes^r and aochavaka and for the last two 
by hotr. After this a cup is filled from the dronakalasa or 
putabhrt for Indra and Agni (Ap. XII. 27. 8, Kat. IX. 13. 20). 
All the soma patras from which soma was drunk by the priests 
are washed on the marjallya place ( Ap. VII. 27. 10), 



Gh. XXXIII ] Agniqtoma-Soma and Ksatriyas il79 

It would not be out of place to remark here that according 
% to the Ait. Br. 35. 2-4 ( referred to on p. 140 above) a ksatriya 
sacrifioer was not to drink soma, but if he desired he might 
drink the liquid obtained by pounding the young sprouts of the 
banyan tree and the fruits of that tree and of the udumbara 
and of other holy trees mixing them with curds." 00 It is 
however to be noted that in classical Sanskrit literature some* 
times kings are desoribed as 'somapah'. The sutras (e. g. Sat. 
VIII. 7. p. 882, Ap. XII. 24.5) say the same. Jai. (III. 5- 
47-51 ) refers to this practice and says that the liquid so pre- 
pared and poured into a cup is called phala-camasa and is really 
an offering made on a coal taken from the ahavanlya to its 
north, and not a mere substitute for some eatable. Vide also 
Jai. III. 6. 36. 

The adhvaryu with the rtu cup in his hand sits down near 
the door of the sadas in front of the hotr with his face to the east 
mutters the words Ida, the summoner of gods * ( Tai. S. III. 
3. 2. 1 ). Then the hotr performs japa of a long passage M01 
( found in Asv. V. 9. 1 ), he issues without uttering hirhk&ra a 
call ( ah&va ) to the adhvaryu loudly viz. ' Som3savo3m ' ( let 
us both praise ) S601 and recites inaudibly the' prayer called

2602. This summons is called ' ShSva ' ( from the root 'hve' to oall ) 
andthisJs the ShSva in all eastras in the morning pressing (Atfv. 
V. 9. 2 ). The most common pratigara uttered by the adhvaryu is 
•irwmt ^T (pronounced as ^trr) while at the first ShSva it is the one given 
above in the text. Vidi asv. V. 9. 4-10, Ap. XII. 27. 11-17, Sat. 
VIII. 8. pp. 896-898 for various modes of the pratigara. The Tai. 8. 
III. 2. 9. 5 puts the pratigara as ' soriisSme daiveti pratyBhvayate '. 
sfirrt is explained as lrfiW?^ snawfti yfir (com. on As*v. V. 9. 4 and

' tfisnlmSarhss.' The adhvaryu stands up or bends his body 
with his face to the west at the door of the eadas and makes the 
response ( pratigara ) with ' somsamo daiva ' ( Asv. V. 9. 5 ). 
There are several fth&vas and several pratigaras in the course 
of reciting all the texts connected with a sastra. The tusnlm- 
saihsa is of three clauses or six clauses ( vide below ). sm Then 
he loudly repeats twelve clauses called nivid, pausing at the end 

of each clause ' fire kindled by the gods, kindled by Manu 

the hotr chosen by the gods May the god bring the gods 

hither, may the god worship the gods, may he, J&tavedas, 
perform the rites ' ( Ait. Br. X. 2, Asv. V. 9. 12 ). ,6M The Ait. 
Br. explains these olauses, says that they are to be loudly 
recited and calls them a puroruc for Jatavedas ( Ait. Br. X. 7 ). 
This vivid is not to be combined with the Tusnlmsamsa, but 
the last word of the former is to be combined with the first 
verse of the ajya sastra, whioh is the name of the hymn 
Rg. III. 13 ( verses 1-7 ). The first verse of this hymn is reoited 

( Contwitedfrom last page ) 

V. 18. 4). The ShSva is required at the beginning of all 
dastras whether recited by the hotr, the maitrSvaruna, brShmanSccha- 
rfisin or acohSvska. Vide asv. V. 10. 10-12 : about the dastras these 
priests recite and how each of the dastras thoy recite in the morning 
and evening pressings contains four Bhffvas and how the dastras in the 
mid-day pressing have five ShSvas. Asv. (V. 10. 13-17) specifies the 
places where HhSva is to be uttered. Various explanations are given 
of the pratigara e.g. SSyana on Ait. Br. XII. 1 explains 'frfcrmt fyftH.' as 
fr imrt tfw *nr wnftt* *"f "JWnwnrhasrr ?wi i '. It appears that the 
ShSva and pratigara came to have a mystic significance and so several 
permutations and combinations of them arose. Vide Ap. XIII. 13.8-10, 
Sat. IX. 3. p. 925 where three different forms of pratigara in the Vai- 
dvadeva dastra of the evening pressing are given. Vide Hang's tr. of

Adv. V. 9. 11. When six olauses are required the three clauses are each 
divided into two parts, the first ending with the first word ' jyotir ' in 
eaob clause. The Ait. Br. IX. 7 says that the first clause in the above 
is the tflsnirhdamsa in Ajyadastra and Praugadastra of the prStahsavana, 
the 2nd of the Nifkevalya and Marutvatlya dastras of the mid-day pres- 
sing and the third of the VaisVadeva and Agnimlruta dastras of the 
third pressing.

thrice, each half of that verse being kept separate from the next 
% half ( Asv. V. 9. 15, 20-21) and 'om' being added to the end 
of the verse. At the end of the sixth verse the hotr repeats the 
ahava ( so3rhsavo3m ) and the adhvaryu responds with the 
pratigara ' soSrhsamo daiva.' And then the hotr recites the 
7th verse of Rg. III. 13 ( which being the last verse of the 
sastra is called paridhanlya, Asv. V. 9. 23 ). At the end of the 
sastra, the adhvaryu responds with the word 'om' (Asv. V. 9, 10). 
After the reoitation of the Sastra the hotr mutters ' the recita- 
tion is concerned in speech ; to thee for glory ' ( Tai. S. III. 
2. 9. 1 ). The adhvaryu then takes the Aindragna cup of Soma 
and the camasadhvaryus take the camasas and after asravana 
and pratyasruta the adhvaryu issues a direction to hotr ' O 
reciter of an uklha ( i. e. sastra ), repeat a y ajya verse for Soma.' 
Then the hotr recites Rg. III. 25. 4 as the yajya ( Asv. V. 9. 26 ) 
and when he utters 'vau3sat' the adhvaryu offers the soma from 
his cup into the ahavanlya fire and after a second vousat is 
uttered ( with the words ' somasySgne vlhi3 vau3sat ' ) the 
camasadhvaryus only shake the Narasamsa cups. The adhvaryu 
first partakes of the remnant from the soma cup and then the 
other priests who have camasas eat the contents of the camasas 
(Ap. XII. 28.1-3). 

It will have been noticed from the preceding description that 
there are six or seven elements connected with the reoitation of 
the sastras : (1) the inaudible japa, (2) ahava and pratigara, 
(3) tusnlrhsamsa, (4) the vivid or puroruk, (5) sukta, (6) japa of 
words ' uktham vaci * ( Asv. V. 10. 22-24 ) with certain words 
added that differ at different times ( this is called ukthavlrya ), 
to which the adhvaryu responds with ' ukthasah ' &c, (7) the 
yajya ( Asv. V. 10. 21 ). s,os Only the Tusnlmsamsa does not 
occur in the other sastras. 

In the Agnistoma there are twelve stotras and twelve 
iastras. The words sastra and stotra in their etymological sense 
mean ' praise or laud, * but a stotra is a laud that is sung to a 
melody and a sastra is a laud that is only recited ( vide Sahara 
on Jai. VIL 2. 17 ). A sastra always belongs to and follows a 
stotra. In the pratahsavana the hotr begins his ahava after the 

2605. Vide Haug'a note 3 on pp. 177-178 to his tr. of Ait. fir. about 
the several ways in which the words ' uktham vffoi ' occur in the several 
iastras. The Ait. Br. speaks of these elements and in X. 1 expressly 
says ' «f| *i awrret V* fti^ fas, «?K^'. 



il82 History of Dharmaiaabra I Oh. XXXIII 

udgfitr makes himkara in the siotra he chants and in the other 
two eavanas the hotr does so after the pratihara element of the 
stotra ( Asv. V. 10. 1-3 ) when the prastotr draws his attention 
by uttering the word ' ess ' ( this ) at the time of the prastava 
of the last verse In the stotra. 2 ' " The ajyasastra is the first 
saBtra in the Agnisfama and the agnimaruta is the last. Jai. 
( IL 1. 13-29 ) establishes that when the vedic text says ' he 
recites the prauga sastra * or ' he chants the ajya stotra, ' what 
is meant is not that these stotras and sastras are merely some 
subordinate matters in connection with the devata of the" rite, 
but they are really principal matters. In X 4. 49 Jai. states 
that in the Agnis^ut sacrifices there is no uha of the stotras and 
sastras of the Agnis^oma, but they are sung and recited as in 
Agnis^oma. In the morning savana ( pressing of soma ), five 
stotras are chanted viz. Bahispavamana and four Ajyastotras ; 
in the mid-day pressing fire more viz. the madhyandina pava- 
mana and four Prsthastotras (vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. 
p. 193 n. 29 ) and in the evening pressing two stotras 
viz. the Arbhava pavamSna and the Agnistoma-s&man ( viz. 
yajfia-yajna vo &c). The corresponding twelve sastras are: in 
the morning the Ajyasastra ( by hotr ), Praugasastra ( by hotr ) 
and three ajyasastras (by maitr&varuna, brahmanaccharhsin and 
acoh&vaka, these three priests being called hotrakas); in the mid- 
day pressing the marutvatlya sastra (by hotr), niskevalya sastra 
(by hotr) and three more by the three assistants of the hotr ; in the 
evening pressing the two sastras are vaisvadevasastra and agni- 
m&rutasastra (both by the hotr). The Bahispavamana is chanted in 
the Trivrtstoma, the four ajyastotras and the madbyandinapava- 
mana in the Paficadasastoma, the four Prsfha-stotras and the 
Arbhavapavamana in the Saptadasastoma and the yajfiayajfilya 
in the Ekavirhsastoma ( vide Tandy a Br. XX. 1. 1 ). Stoma 
means a group of verses and pancadasastoma and similar words 
mean that the verses (usually three) are increased to 15, 17, 21 
&c. by repetition in various patterns (which are called vistuti). 
There are three vis^utis of the pafioadasastoma. These patterns 
differ in the order and number of repetitions. The prastotr 
marks the several turns, the number of verses and the order by 
means of small sticks a span long (oalled kuias ) cut from the 
udumbara tree and placed on a piece of cloth spread in the

^rst ajyastotra (Rg.VI. 16. 10-12 = S. V. II. 1. 1. 4, ed. by 
Benfey) is raised to fifteen verses in three paryayas ( turns ) of 
five verses each. If the three verses are denoted by a, b, o 
then the 15 verses will be a a a b c ( first paryaya), a b b b o 
( 2nd paryaya ) and a b o o c ( third paryaya ). Vide Tandya

ted byaaabc, abc, abbbcoc and the third visfati by

The word stoma is to be distinguished from stotra. The latter 
is a chant of a certain number of verses set to a certain melody 
out of those mentioned in the ganas of the Samaveda. Stobhas 
are musical interjections and flourishes introduced in the s&man 
chants such as 'hau\ 'hai\ '1*, 'u', 'hum* (vide Chin. Up. 
1.13). Hau and hSi are stobhas employed in the Rathantara 
and Vamadevya samans respectively. Jai. IX. 2. 39 defines 
stobha as that which is in addition to the letters of the rk ( that 
is being chanted ) and has other varnas than those of the rk 
( adhikam ca vivarnam ca Jaiminih stobha-sabdatvafc ). Tbe 
word soman means, no doubt, a chant ( glti ), but since stobhas 
are necessary to bring out the melody and help in musical 
appreciation they are included in the connotation of the word 
sftman 8WT ( Jai. II. 1. 36, IX. 2. 34-38 ). Sahara states that 
there are a thousand (numberless) means of adding to the 
charm of the melody ( glti ), which only oonveys certain notes 
produced by internal effort and which is denoted by the word 
saman. The chant has a fixed extent and is sung on a rk verse. 
In order to effectuate that chant resort is made to change of 
letter (as in ' ogriayi ' for ' agna* in ' agna ayahi vltaye), to stobha 
and the other devices stated below "° 8 . Since the rk verses are

sung to a certain melody the rka are the skeleton, the notes of 
the melody are the flesh that clothes the bare bones, they are . 
super-imposed over the rk, and the stobhas are embellishments 
or flourishes like the hair on one's body. This very apt and 
happy figure i9 employed by the Samavidhana BrShmana 
to illustrate the relationship of the rks, the notes and the 
stobhas. tm Each saman chant is primarily connected with 
oertain verses, e. g. when we speak of Rathantara without 
more the verses meant are Rg. VII. 32. 22-23 abhi tva sura&c.= 
S. V. II. 1. 1. 11 ( Benfey ) and S. V. vol. III. pp. 83-84 ( B. I. 
series ) ; and when one refers to the Vamadevya saman without 
further qualification the verses intended are Rg. IV. 31. 1-3 
(kaya nasoitra abhuvat) = S. V. II. 1. 1. 12 (Benfey) and 
S. V. vol. III. pp. 87-89 (B. I.). These are called the own 
( svaklya ) verses of the respective samans ( vide com. on 
Dr&hyayana II. 1. 1 ) and that one verse occurring in the pur- 
varcika part of the Samaveda, which is the first in the saman 
as set out in the Uttararcika portion, is called the yard of the 
saman ( Jai. VII. 2. 17 and Sahara thereon ). But the verses 
that are the own verses of a saman can be sung to another 
melody. Tandya XV. 10. 1 says ' the kavatl verses * are the 
verses ' kaya nascitra &c.' whioh are the Bvaklya verses of the 
Vamadevya. When some texts say ' he chants the Rathantara 
on the Kavatl verses' what is meant is that, not minding 
the VSmadevya melody to whioh the verses ' kaya nascitra &c.' 
primarily attach themselves, they are to be sung to the Rathan- 
tara melody in that particular rite. So the word saman as 
applied to Rathantara, Brhat, Raivata and others means 
simply a melody and not one or more rk verses that are 
sung M, ° ( vide Jai. IX. 2. 1-2 ). 

Jaimini deals in aboutt>0 adhikaranas with matters arising 
out of the relation of the Samaveda to sacrifices in V. 3, IX. 1, 
IX. 2, X 5-6 and elsewhere. Some of the conclusions are 
very interesting and may be briefly indicated ; viz. the uha- 
grantha is of human authorship ( IX 2. 1-2 ), the rk is principal 
and the melody is an attribute of it ( IX. 2. 3-13 ), the whole

melody ia to be sung on each rk of the saman ( IX 2. 14-20 ), 
^the verses of a s&man should as far as possible be in the same 
metre ( IX. 2. 21-22 ), the rk verses set out in the UttarSrcika 
are to be taken for singing the melody on ( IX. 2. 23-24 ), that 
two verses have to be arranged as three by repetition of the 
4th or last pada in certain melodies ( IX. 2. 25-27 ), that in the 
Yajnayajnlya saman for the words ' gira gira * in the original 
' ira ira ' has to be substituted in the melody ( IX. 1. 50-51 ). 

After the reoitation of the sastra and the partaking of 
remnants of soma the adhvaryu takes the Vaisvadeva cup, fills 
it from the dronakalasa, touches it with two kusa blades, hands 
over the blades to the prastotr priest and urges the saman 
priests to chant a stotra. This is the mode in all cases of 
dhurya stotras. Stotras other than the Bahispavamana are 
chanted near the Audumbarl post in the sadas ; the prastotr sits 
facing the west behind the adhvaryu, the udgatr sits to his west 
facing the north, and the pratihartr sits facing udgatr, but 
looking towards the south-east ( Tandya VI. 4. 14, Drahyayana 
III. 3. 28 ). The stotra chanted after the Vaisvadeva cup is 
taken and the three following ones are called ajyastotras 8 " 1 
( com. on Ap. XII. 28. 6 ). The 2nd sastra is called prauga ( Asv. 
V. 10. 6 ) whioh is recited after the taking up of the Vaisvadeva 
cup and is supposed according to the Ait. Br. XL 2 to confer 
food. This sastra is made up of Rg. I. 2 and 3 (in all 21 verses), 
which are divided into seven triplets addressed to seven deities 
in order viz. Vayu, Indra-vayu, Mitra and Varuna, Asvins, 
Indra, Visve Devas, Sarasvatl. Eaoh of the seven triplets is 
preceded by a verse called puroruk. The first puroruk is pre- 
ceded by ' hirh ' and 'bhur-bhuvah svaro 3m.' "" The 2nd verse 
of Rg. I. 2 is repeated thrice ( and not the first as is usual, com. 
on Asv. V. 10. 6). At the end of the reoitation the priest mutters

'ukthamvaci slokaya tv5' (instead of ' ghosaya tv5'), and 
Rg. 1. 14. 10 is the y&jyft of the Prauga-sastra. This oup is' 
offered and the remnants of it and of the camasas are drunk by 
the priests. Then from the Ukthyasthall containing soma a third 
is taken for filling three cups to Mitra and Varuna, Indra, 
and Indra-Agni. Stotras and sastras follow at each of these 
three cups, the sastras being repeated respectively by the 
maitravaruna, brahmanacohaihsin and acchavaka. For want of 
space all these three sastras cannot be set out at length here. 
Asv. V. 10. 26 very suocintly incticates them. Eaoh of these 
sastras has four parts, (1) a triplet called stotriya (because those 
very verses have been chanted in the corresponding stotra ) ; 
(2) then another triplet called anurupa which should agree in 
metre, deity and even the sage (according to some) with the 
stotriya triplet (Asv. V. 10. 26-27); (3) the core or principal 
part of the sastra, hence called uktha-mukha ( vide San. VII. 
11. 3 ) ; (4) a yajya verse. For example, in the maitravaruna 
sastra, Rg. III. 62. 16-18 constitute the stotriya triplet ( those 
three verses are chanted as the 2nd ajyastotra), Rg. V. 71. 1-3 
form the anurupa triplet, Rg. V. 68. 1-5 and Rg. VII. 66. 1-9 
are the uktha-mukha and Rg. VII. 66. 19 is the yajya of the 
sastra. This brings the pr&tahsavana to an end, and the adhva- 
ryu makes an offering at the end with the words ' May Agni 
protect us in the morning savana*. At the bidding of the 
adhvaryu the maitravaruna asks all the priests to come out of 
the sadas and they come out by the way they went in. 

Then before the madhyandina savana begins the priests 
again enter the sadas, and the yajamana enters by the eastern 
door. The prooedure of the mid-day pressing is in main out- 
lines the same as that of the morning one ( Ap. XIII. 1. 2). 
There is no hurry in the first two pressings, but the third press- 
ing is got through with speed (Ap. XII. 29. 12 ). There are a few 
points of difference. In the mid-day pressing there are no cups 
for the joint deities (dvidevatya grahas), no cups for the seasons 
( Ap. XIII 1. 4 ). The great pressing is done as in the morning 
pressing, but in a loud voice ( Ap. XIII. 1. 8 ). In this pressing 
the vasatlvarl waters are taken in the hotrcamasa, are handed 
over to the yajamana and become the nigrabhya for pressing 
soma. The oloth in whioh soma stalks are tied is loosened and 
given for wearing as a turban to the priest called gravastut and it 
is taken back from him after he reoites the praise of the crushing 
stone ( Ap. XIII. 1. 5 and com.). The cups taken are five, viz. 
oukraand manthin, ftgrayana, two marutvatlya and ukthya 



Oh. XXXIII ] Agni§toma-Madhyandim*savam 1187 

( also taken either before both marutvatlya-oups or between the 
.two ). The gravastut ( praiser of the stones used in crushing 
soma stalks ) enters the havirdhana pavilion by the eastern 
door, throws away a blade of kusa on a spot which is to the 
north-east of the northern point of the axle of the southern 
havirdhana cart and stands opposite the soma stalks with face 
to the south-east. He takes the cloth in his joined hands, folds 
it round his head and face from left to right thrice ( so as to 
make it look like a turban ). When the stalks of soma are 
plaoed for being crushed he should recite certain verses by 
the middle tone ( Asv. V. 12. 7-8 ), which is the tone for all 
vedic texts in the mid-day pressing. The texts repeated by the 
gravastut are ( Asv. V. 12. 9-11): Rg. I. 24. 3, V. 81. 1, VIII. 81. 
1, VIII. 1.1, X. 94 (this hymn is called Arbuda), Rg. X 76 
and 175. Before the last verse of Rg. X. 94, the two hymns 
Rg. X. 76 and X. 175 are reoited. Either between the latter 
two hymns or after them or before them he reoites as many 
pavamana verses as are required up till the taking up of the 
cups, finishes the last verse of Rg. X. 94 and hands back the 
turban to the saorificer. Asv. further directs that from the 
hymn Rg. X. 94 which has 14 verses the 4th is taken out 
and the last is the paridhanlya ( the finishing verse ) and 
the rest (12 verses ) are divided into four triplets and 
each of the triplets is either preceded or followed by a 
triplet out of the following viz. Rg. I. 91, 16-18, IX. 8. 4, 
IX. 15. 8, IX. 107. 21, VIII. 72. 8, VIII. 72. 16, IX. 17. 4, 
IX. 67. 14-15 ( which together come to twelve verses ). The 
four triplets are respectively recited by the gravastut at the 
time of sprinkling water on the soma stalks, pounding with 
the hands, extracting juice, and collecting the soma juioe in 
the adhavanlya trough ( Asv. V. 12. 15-19 ). In the mid-day 
pressing the plaoe of the Babispavamana is taken by the 
Madhyandina-pavamana stotra ( Ap. XIII. 3. 7 ). This stotra 
consists of Rg. IX. 61. 10-12, X. 107. 4-5, X. 87. 1-3, that is 
Samaveda II. 1. 1. 8-10 ( Benfey ) and S. V. vol. III. pp. 22-23, 
41-42, 78-80. The yajamana mutters several texts before the 
madhyandina pavamana is chanted and during its chanting 
( Ap. XIII. 3. 1 ). 

After the chanting of the Madhyandina-pavamana comes 
the rite called Dadhigharma, if the saorificer has performed the 
Pravargya rite (Asv. V. 13. 1). The pratiprasth&tr brings 
curds in the ladle ( sruo ) made of udumbara ; the curds are 
heated on the agnldhriya fire. The hotr when asked ' is the 



1188 History of Dharmaiantra I Oh. XXXIII 

havis heated ' repeats Rg, X. 179. 2 as the anuvakyS and 
X. 179. 3 is the ySjya and after he says ' vau3sat ' the curds are 
offered in the Shavanlya, and when he repels ' agne vlhi ' and 
also a second vausat another offering of the heated ourds is 
made and the remnants of curds are eaten by those who partake 
of the remnants in the Pravargy a rite. Then the pasupurodasa 
( of the animal killed in the morning ) and the other offerings 
(suoh as purodasa on eleven potsherds) are made and the 
remnants eaten. Then ten camasas are filled ( including that 
of acohavaka ). Then offerings of soma from the sukra and 
manthin cups are made respectively by the adhvaryu and 
pratiprasthatr and the camas&dhvaryuB offer the soma taken in 
their camasas and the remnants are partaken by the priests. 
After this come the offerings of ajya called daksinahuti or 
daksina homa ( K&t. X. I. 4., Sat. IX. 2. p. 910 ). The procedure 
• here resembles the Vaisarjina homa described above (p. 1158). 
Gold is tied by the hem of the garment that covers the yajamana 
and his family, it is placed in the ajya contained in the juhu, 
and two fthutis are offered with ' udu tyam ' ( Rg. I. 50. 1 ) and 
' citram ( Kg. 1. 115. 1 ) in the garhapatya fire, the piece of gold 
is taken out and the yajamana holding that gold piece and 
ajya in his hand approaches the daksinas ( the various articles 
that constitute the fee ) placed to the south of the mahavedi. 
Vide Sat. Br. IV. 3. 4 about daksina ( derived from ' daksay * 
to invigorate ) where it is stated that no priest should officiate 
at a soma sacrifice for a fee less than one hundred cows. Ap. 
( XIII. 5. 1 — XIII. 7. 15 ) gives numerous rules about the 
daksina to be distributed among the sixteen priests. The daksina 
may consist of 7, 21, 60, 100, 112, or 1000 cattle or an unlimited 
number or a man may give all his wealth except the share of 
the eldest son 8 " 5 and when he gives a thousand cattle or all his 
wealth he has to give one mule in addition ( Ap. XIII. 5. 1-3 ). 
He may also give goats, sheep, horses, slaves, an elephant, 
clothes, chariots, corn of various kinds, asses, A man may 
give his own daughter in marriage ( in the daiva form ) as fee 
( Asv. V. 13. 7 ). With regard to the cows meant as fee Ap. 
states that the yajamana drives them with the black antelope 
skin so as to form them into four groups. One group ( i. e. | of 
the whole number ) is given to the adhvaryu and his assistants 

2813. Prof . Keith in • Religion and Philosophy oLthe Veda ' part 
2 p. 330 says 'after which the fees should be given consisting of 

7*21 cattle or all the sactifioer's goods save his eldest son '. He 

obviously means ' save his eldest son's share '. 



Ch. XXXIII ] Agmstoma-distritntUcn of daktfw 1189 

in such a way that the pratiprasthatr, nestr and unnetr receive 
respectively half, one-third and one-fourth of what the 
adhvaryu gets ; that is, as stated by Eat. X. 2. 25 and the com. 
on Ap. XIII. 2. 12, twelve cows are given to each of the four 
principal priests, 6, 4 and 3 respectively to each of their 
assistants in the order stated above in note 2228 ( supposing 
one hundred cows are to be distributed ). Jai. ( as indicated 
below ) and Manu VIII. 210 refer to this rule of distribution. 
The agnldhra is the first recipient of gifts, receiving a piece 
of gold, purnapatra and a pillow woven with threads of all 
colours. The pratihartr is the last reoipient ( Ap. XIII. 6. 2, 
Est. X. 2. 39 ). Gifts are made to the priests while they sit 
inside the sadas and to the adhvaryu and his assistants in the 
havirdhana pavilion. To a br&hmana of the Atri gotra ( who 
is not a rtvik ) a gold piece iB given before everybody else or 
after the agnldhra ( Ap. XIII. 6. 12, Eat. X. 2. 21 ). After the 
agnldhra come brahma, udgatr and hotr ( Eat. X. 2. 26 ). Apart 
from the gifts meant for the rtviks something is given accord- 
ing to ability and inclination to the camasSdhvaryus, the 
sadasya and to sight-seers in the sadas ( they are called prasar- 
pakas ), except to those who belong to the Eanva or Easyapa 
gotra or those who ask for a gift (Ap. XIII. 7. 1-5, Eat. X. 2. 35). 
Ap. ( XIII. 7. 6-7 ) says that generally no gift is to be given to 
one who is not a brahmana, but a gift may be given to a 
non-brahmana who knows the Vedic lore, while no gift is to be 
made to a brahmana who is not learned. Eat. X. 2. 38 states 
that the wife also joins in making gifts. After the anuvfikya 
is repeated by the maitravaruna for the marutvatlya cup to be 
described below no gifts are made (Ap. XIII. 7, 14, Eat. 
X. 3. 2 ). On making the gifts the saorificer does obeisance 
( namask&ra ) to the priests and utters an invocation as to ani- 
mals donated in the words ' who gave to whom?' 8614 Drahya- 
yana ( V. 3. 14-19 ) states that before accepting a gift every 
priest murmurs the famous mantra ' I take thee at the impulse 
of god Savitr.... &c ' ( Tandya I. 8. 1 ) and after receiving the 
gift each donee murmurs ' who gave to whom ' ( Tandya 
I. 8. 17 ). The gifts are taken away by the path between the 
agnldhrlya sbed and the sadas and then by the tlrtha ( Drahya- 
yana V. 3. 13 ). Jai. ( X. 2. 22-28 ) declares that the making 
of gifts to the priests is not merely a formal act as part of the 
sacrificial rites, but is intended to induce the priests to give

their servioes in return for the gifts; In Jsi. X. 3. 39-49 it is 
concluded that in the words ' the daksina is 112 ' the vedic text 
refers only to cows and not to the various kinds of corns, in 
X. 3. 50-52 that the division of the gifts is to be made by the 
sacrifioer and not left to be done by the priests and that all the 
priests do not share equally, but acoording to the Vedic texts 
some get half ( they are ardhinah ), others one-third ( they are 
called trtlyinah ) and still others one-fourth ( X. 3. 53-55 ). Jai. 
XII. 1. 32 states that as valuable gifts are given in SomaySga, 
there is no rice cooked ( called anvaharya ) for the priests in the 
istis of Somayaga as there is in darsapurnamSsa ( note 2390 ). 

When the gifts are taken away by the priests the saorificer 
casts away the antelope horn in the c&tvala pit with two 
mantras ( ip. XIII. 7. 16 ). Jai. ( IV. 2. 16-19 ) says that this 
casting away is the final disposal of the horn ( it is a pratipatti- 
karma ) and ( in XL 3. 13-14 ) that this casting takes plaoe on 
the last day in sacrifices like the Dvadasaha. The adhvaryu 
offers five offerings of ajya called Vaisvakarmana ( i. e. for 
Visvakarman ) in the agnldhra fire with five mantras from Tai. 
S. III. 2. 8. 1-3 ( Ap. XIII. 7. 17 and Sat. IX. 2. p. 911 ). The 
adhvaryu and the pratiprasth&tr take two cups for ( Indra ) 
Marutvat and offer them. The remnants of the cup in prati- 
prasthatr's hand are poured in the adhvaryu's cup ; from this 
mixture a portion is poured in the cup of the pratiprasthatr. The 
priests partake of the remnants. Then a third Marutvatlya cup is 
taken to the accompaniment of the sastra called marutvatlya 1615 

2616. The parts of the n^c^rfhj^rsr may be briefly indicated here 
from asv. V. 14. 3ff. fg- ijj§*: ^3* i stwtvT 9Jf3*njfr3ir. ( wTfres) •

pratipad ), Rg. VIII. 2. 1-3 (a triplet called anucara), Eg. VIII. 63. 5-6 
(called Indranihnava pragStha); Rg. I. 40. 5-6 (called BrSbmanaspatya

drnvate tvff ' ( asv. V. 14. 26 ) ; and lastly Rg. III. 47. 4 as the yXjyff. 
This dastra follows after and is connected with the Msdhyandina 
pavamSna stotra ( com. on KSt. X. 3. 7 ). According to Est. X. 3. 8 the 
pratigara of adhvaryu here is 'modSmo daiva.' According to asV. V. 14. 
7-8 pratipad and anucara consist of three verses and pragSthas consist 
of two rk verses. A pragKtha is called BSrhata when the two verses are 
in Brbati and SatobihatI metres and it ia called Kskubba when there is a 
combination of verses in the Eskubh and SatobrbaW metres.

recited by the hotr ( Ap. XIII. 8. 2 ) and at the end of the recita- 
tion of that sastra it is offered. Then a cup for Mahendra is 
taken. The stotra for Mahendra is called Prstha," 1 ' and is 
chanted at this time, being sung in Ratha ntara melody ( La^. 
II. 9. 7, Asv. V. 15. 2-3 ). Then follows the Niskevalya 
sastra by the hotr. After the Mahendra cup is offered, the 
pratiprasthatr, nestr and unnetr take up three grahas (cups) 
called Atigrahya respectively for Agni, Indra and SQrya ( Ap. 
XIII. 8. 7-9 ). Then three Ukthya cups are offered as in the 
morning pressing. Then three Prsthastotras 8617 are ohanted, 

2616. The Rg. verses of the Rathantara sSman are (VII. 32.22-23);

1192 History of DharmaiUstra [ Oh. XXXIII 

each followed respectively by the sastras recited by the maitra- 
varuna, brahmanaochamsin and acohavaka. This closes the' 
mid-day pressing of soma. 

The evening pressing commences with the taking of the 
Aditya cup ( a cup the deity of which is Aditi ). In the third 
pressing the Vedic texts are to be uttered in the highest tone 
( Asv. V. 17. 1 ). The procedure in this pressing resembles 
that of the mid-day pressing (Sat. V. 3. p. 915). The adhvaryu, 
the saorificer, the pratiprasthatr, agnldhra and unnetr enter the 
havirdhana shed by the eastern door and the wife enters by the 
western door ( Kat. X. 3. 2-3 ). The doors of the havirdhana 
shed are shut when there are many persons sitting inside the 
vedi ( Ap. XIII. 9. 2, Sat. IX. 3. p. 915 ). The adhvaryu takes 
into the Aditya cup a part of the remnants of the soma from 
the cups for the joint deities. In the middle or western part of 
the aditya cup he adds curds and then again takes the whole of 
the remnants of the soma from the cups for the joint deities (that 
has been poured in the adity asthall). He stirs the contents of the 
cup with the upa/h&usavana stone used in crushing the soma stalks 
and mixes them well together. He then takes out the stone and 
places it among the stones used for crushing soma stalks. The 
aditya cup is not placed down, but is covered with darbhas or 
with the right hand of the adhvaryu, who comes out after the 
doors of the havirdhana are opened, takes it to the uttaravedi, 
stirs the contents with darbhas in such a way that a few 
drops fall down out of the cup. After the usual praisa 
and the other procedure the adhvaryu throws the darbhas 
on the ahavanlya and offers the contents of the aditya 
cup into fire. At the time of offering the contents and 
also immediately after doing so he does not look at the 
offering but looks elsewhere ( Asv. V. 17. 3 ). He does not 
partake of the remnants of soma in the aditya cup but 
keeps it with the remnants of soma therein among the several 
vessels. He puts on the rjlsa ( the dregs of soma stalks ) 
that is left after the two pressings the stalks ( amsu ) that are 
in the adabhya vessel and the upariisupatra and silently 
extracts soma juice therefrom. In the agnldhra shed the 
sacrificed wife prepares by churning ' ftsir ' ( milk mixed with 
soma ) and enters the havirdhana shed by the western door. The 
yajamSna enters by the eastern door, spreads on the mouth of 
the putabhrt trough the strainer and pours thereon along with 
his wife the Mir with four mantras ( Tai. S. III. 2. 8. 4-5 ). He 



Ch. XXXIII ] AgnistomarTrtlyaaavana 1193 

fills the agrayana cup from four streams ( the fourth being 
from the remnants of soma in the Sdityapatra ), while in the 
mid-day pressing there are only three streams (Sat. IX. 3. 
p. 918, Ap. XIII. 10. 11 ). In this pressing no turban is given 
to the gravastut priest. Then the Viprud-dhoma is performed. 
The Arbhava E618 pavamana is then chanted on the lines of the 
Madhyandina pavamana. 

The havis prepared from the various limbs of the (savanlya) 
pasu sacrificed in the morning is then offered ( Ap. XIII. 11. 3, 
Asv. V. 17. 4 ). After the ids is partaken of by the hotr, the 
purodasa ( cake baked on 12 potsherds, Sat. IX. 3. p. 920 ) is 
offered to Indra and the rest of the procedure up to the laying 
down of the Narasamsa oups is followed. Then soma of the 
third pressing is offered by the adhvaryu from the hotroamasa 
and by the camasadhvaryus from their camasas and as else* 
where the priests and camasadhvaryus partake of the remnants. 
After the Narasamsa cups are laid down each of the priests 
who drink soma from camasas takes from the softest part of 
the purodasa three small balls ( or pills ), places them on the 
ground to the south of his own camasa and they then offer them 
to their own father, grand-father and great-grand-father with 
the appropriate mantras a,, » ( Ap. XIII. 12. 9, Asv. V. 17. 5 ). 
They mutter the namaskara mantras ( vide note 2438 above ) 
and the sacrificer utters the Sad-dbotr mantras ( Ap. XIII. 12.

10-11 ) which are in Tai. Ar. III. 4. Then the Sftvitra cup is 
offered ( Ap. XIII. 13. 1, Adv. V. 18. 1 ). The Vaisvadeva cup 
is thereafter filled from the Putabhrt trough, but there is no 
stotra chanted for this oup; the vaisvadeva sastra however 
is recited by the hotr ( Asv. V. 18. 5-13 ). Then rioe ( oaru ) 
is boiled for being offered to god Soma. The adhvaryu wears 
the sacred thread in the praclnavlfca form, cuts off to the south 
of the ahavanlya one oblation from the boiled rioe with his 
right hand and another with the mekaana, crosses to the north 
of the ahavanlya, and with his face to the south offers in the 
southern part of the ahavanlya fire the oblations of rioe, the 
yajya being 'tvarh soma pitrbhih. sariividanah' (Rg.VIIL 48.13). 
Ajya is poured on the remnants of the cam in the pot, the 
adhvaryu sees hie face in the clarified butter ( Asv. V. 19. 4 ), 
anoints his eyes with the ajya by means of his thumb and ring- 
finger and then hands over the pot of rioe ( with ajya therein ) 
to the three udgatr priests, who see their reflections in the ajya 
and if they cannot see their reflection ( which is an evil omen ) 
then more ajya is poured and two mantras are repeated (Asv. V. 
19. 5, one being ' bhadram karnebhih ' Rg. 1. 89. 8 ) and then again 
they look for their reflection in the ajya. The agnldhra carries 
lighted roots of darbhas to the several dhisnyas and establishes 
them thereon as fires and the adhvaryu pours ajya taken afresh 
in a pot over them while the darbhas are glowing ( Ap. 
XIII. 14. 5-6, Sat. IX. 4 p. 929). He keeps some ajya in the pot, 
takes the cup called Pfitnlvata, mo fills it from the soma in the 
Agrayanasthall, mixes in it the ajya that remains after pouring 
over on the dhisnya fire-brands and offers it into the northern 
part of the fire. Jai. ( in III. 2. 33-37 ) lays down several pro- 
positions about this oup viz. that it is offered only to Agni 
Patnlvat and not also to Indra-Vayu and other joint deities 
( though the soma in the agrayanasthall had in it the remnants 
of the oontents of the grahas for joint deities ), that, though the 
mantra in offering it oontains the word Tvas.tr ( ' ! Agni Pat- 
nlvat 1 drink soma joined with god Tvastr ' ) that oup of soma 
is offered only to Agni Patnlvat and not to Tvastr also and 

2620. The Pltnlvata cup is offered to Agni Patnlvat. The ySjyS

that, though Rg. III. 6. 9 ( the yajyS verso ) contains a prayer 
about the thirty-three gods, the Patnlvata is not to be supposed 
tb be offered to them also. The adhvaryu then issues various 
directions to the several priests ( Ap. XIII. 14. 11, Sat. IX. 4. 
p. 930 ). The ftgnldhra sits on the lap""" of the nest? and par- 
takes of the remnants of the Patnlvata cup ( Asv. V. 19. 8, Est. 
X. 6. 24), while so sitting. He washes that cup on the marja- 
llya and keeps it on the khara. The camasas of the hotr and 
others are filled by the unnetr in such a way that no soma is 
left, the two jars of soma are wiped with the daias and they 
are all kept with mouths turned downwards. The adhvaryu starts 
the udgatr priests on their chant of Yajnayajnlya stotra ( Ap. 
XIII. 15. 3 ), which is the principal stotra of the Agnis^oma 
( Sat. IX. 4. p. 931 calls it ' Agnistoma S&man ' ). All those 
priests who are to chant the stotra and the ohoristers cover 
their heads together with the ears. 8 ' 88 Those who come as 
sight-seers into the sadas should join in the chant as choristers 
( Ap. XIII. 15. 6 ). When the udgatr makes the hinkara of the 
yajnayajflya stotra he looks at the sacrificer's wife who is 
brought by the nest? near the udgatr. When the nidhana 
( finale ) of the first verse is being sung the wife removes the 
garment from her right thigh and with her face to the north 
pours the pannejani water on her thigh up till the prastava of 
the third stotrlya of the first paryaya tm ( so as to leave no water 
in the jar ). The wife retires to her shed when the udgatr asks 
her to go or when he has looked at her thrice and she has 
poured water thrice ( Kat. X 7. 5-6 ). While the chant prooeeds 
the saorificor repeats the saptahotr mantras ( note 2393 above ). 
The Yajaayajrilya saman is Rg. VI. 48. 1-2= Samaveda

this sitting on the lap of the nesfr and so give an option ' wfiw smffnr 

2622. According to Ap. XIII. 15. 5 it is optional to cover the ears. 
According to Sat. IX. 4. p. 931, all persons whether priests or sightseers 
that are in tho sadas cover their heads and ears and the yajamKna may 
do so or not.

When the last verse ( paridhanlya ) of the Agnimaruta 
sastra is being recited ( or at one of several other stages, accord- 
ing to Ap. XIII. 16. 2-5 and Sat. IX. 4. p. 933 ) the pratipra- 
sthatr brings into the hotr-camasa the soma contained in the 
dhruva graha and the adhvaryu offers the soma contained in 
that camasa and the oamasadhvaryus offer the soma in their 
cups and the priests partake of the remnants. When the 
upayaja homa with reference to the animal killed in the morn- 
ing is performed and the paridhis are cast into the fire, he takes 
the Hariyojana cup." 88 The unnetr brings into it all the soma 
contained in the agrayana-sthall and mixes therein plenty of 
fried barley grains, places the oup on his head, comes out of 
the havirdhana shed, steps backwards and forwards several 
times. Then the contents are offered to Indra ( the tyaga by the 
yajamana is ' idam Indraya harivate ' ) and the remnants are 
brought to the sadas for being partaken by the priests and the 
sacrificer. They distribute the remnants into other vessels, 
drink the fluid only smacking their lips, press the fried grains 
between their teeth so as to extraot and take in all juice out of 
them and spit out of the vedi the masticated fried grains and 
sip water. Aooording to some ( Kat. X. 8. 5 ) the priests only 
smell the fried grains. They throw chips of the tree from which 
the yupa was made into the ahavanlya each with ' thou art the 
expiation ( means of removal ) of the evil caused by gods, men 
pitrs &o.* ( Vaj. S. VIII. 13., Tai. S. III. 2. 5. 7 quoted in Ap. 
XIII. 17. 9 ). They partake of the thick cheese-like layer on 
curds with ' dadhikravno * ( Rg. IV. 39. 6 ) in the Bgnldhra 
shed ( Sat. IX. 4. p. 935, Ap. XIII. 18. 1 ). They cast into the

grass, squeeze that grass well, impart to the water a sharp 
flavour ( by the juice of the dflrva ), pour the water into ten 
camasaa. Each priest smells his camasa ( and those who have 
none smell the one nearest to them) to the west of the catvala or 
in the place (called Sstava) where the BahispavamSna was 
chanted ( Ap. XIII. 17. 9, Kat. X. 8. 7, Sat. IX. 4. p. 935 ) and 
pour the water down into the catvala pit ( Sat. IX. 4 p. 935, or 
inside the vedi according to Ap. XIII. 18. 1 ). All priests wait 
upon the ahavanlya with the minda mantra ' yanma atmano 
mindabhut* ( whatever fault has been mine, Agni has mended 
it ' &c. Tai. S. III. 2. 5. 4 ). The priests then discharge them- 
selves from the vow made at the Tanunaptra ceremony. Then 
the PatnlsarhySjas are performed as in the animal sacrifice 
( Ap. XIII. 18. 3 ). The adhvaryu offers with the juhu nine 
samisfayajus offerings in a continuous stream, standing inside 
the vedi. Then he performs the prayascittas for actions like 
spilling soma drops about and offers a savanahuti ( i. e. an ajya 
offering indicating the completion of the Agnistoma). The 
adhvaryu issues a direction to the maitravaruna to urge the 
priests to come out of the sacrificial shed and the latter do so. 

Then follows the Avabhrtha ( the final purificatory bath ). 
The procedure of this is an isti. Jaimini, however, in X.7. 47-50 
lays down that the avabhrtha is a special rite and therefore 
all that takes place in the darsaparnamasa isti does not follow 
as a matter of course. A fuel-stick is laid on fire, a veda 
bunch is made, kusa is strewn round the fires ( that is paris- 
tarana), the necessary yajnapatras are placed with mouths 
downwards, No idhma is brought and some do not even prepare 
the vedi. Only four ladlings of ajya are taken in all the 
ladles ( sruc ). The nirvapa is only for a cake to Varuna on 
one potsherd ( Ap. XIII. 19. 3 ). There are no pranlta waters 
( Sat. IX. 5. p. 938 ), and no girding up of the wife ( vide above 
p. 1040 for it ). The ajya in the ladles and the grains taken 
out for purodssa are plaoed on the shoal der ( north corner on 
eastern side) of the uttaravedi. The saorificer takes out from 
its pit the post of udumbara ( audumbarl in the sadas ), plaoes 
it on the hide and board used in extracting soma juice and all 
other utensils except the four sthalls viz. the Sgrayana, ukthya 
aditya-sthftll and dhruvSsthall ( vide Tai. Br. I. 4. 1 for these 
four sthalls of day ) that are smeared with soma in the space 
between the catvSla pit and the utkara or on the northern 
shoulder of the vedi on the large stool ( asandl ) used for soma. 



Ch. XXXIII ] Agmtfoma-Avdbhrtha 1199 

The yajamana oasts away the antelope skin in the catvala pit 
,( other ways of disposal are also mentioned in Ap. XIII. 19. 
8-9 ). When starting for avabhrtha he offers clarified butter 
with ' O I Fire, that givest life &o. * ( Tai. S. I. 3. 14. 4 ), a 
seoond oblation with the mantra ' avabhrtha, nicumpuna &o. ' 
( Vaj. S. VIII. 27 ).«•» 

A third oblation of ajya is made to Rudra ( Ap. XIII. 20. 1 ) 
with ' namo RudrSya ' ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 9 ). When starting from 
the vedi or from near the catvala with faces to the north they 
recite Rg. I. 24. 8 (Tai. S. 1.4.45.1).* The adhvaryu issues 
a direction to the prastotr to chant a saman. The saman chanted 
is called ' avabhrthasaman ' ( Lat. II. 12. 1 ). It is ' agnis^apati * 
(vide Sat. Br. IV. 4. 5. 8 and Drahyayana sr. VI. 4. 1). When the 
nidhana of the saman is being sung, all the priests, the yaja- 
mana and his wife thrice repeat that finale. They do so a 
second time when they have traversed half of the distance to 
the reservoir of water and a third time when they reach the 
water (Ap. XIII. 20. 4 and Sat. IX. 5. p. 941 ). The same pro- 
cedure is followed for the Varuna purodasa as in Varunapra- 
ghasas for niskasa. The dregs of soma are thrown into water 
with the branch of the udumbara tree and curds are poured 
over it. All utensils smeared with soma are thrown into 
water (Ap. XIII. 21. 12, Kat. X 8. 24). Jai. (IV. 2.19-22) 
says that this casting into water is merely the final disposal 
( pratipatti ) of these utensils and the iruti passage ' they 
approach the water for the final bath with whatever is smeared 
with soma' does not lay down any subordinate matter about 
avabhrtha. The girdle of the yajamana and the yoktra, the 
jala ( net on the head of the wife) and the antelope skin of the 
wife are dipped in water. The yajamana invokes the water 
with ' devlrapah ' ( Tai. S. I. 4. 45. 3 ) and enters. The deep 
silent waters of flowing rivers are to be preferred, but in the 
absence of such waters any water reservoir will do (Kat. X.8.19). 
The yajamana and the wife enter water, splash water on their 
heads (but do not dip them into water), rub each other's back. 
A handful of kusa is thrown into the water and this handful 
in the water serves as the ahavanlya for all ahutis in avabhrtha.

1200 History of DharmaiMra [ Oh. XXXIII 

The prayftjas and anuyajas are offered as in darsapurnamaaa 
( except to God Barhis ). Jai. ( XL 2. 30-34 ) lays down that not, 
only is the prinoipal offering of purodasa offered into water 
but also all subordinate ones like fighsras. A portion of the 
purodasa for Varuna is offered therein. The rest of the purodasa 
is offered to Agni and Varuna, whioh becomes the Svistakrt 
offering in this case (KatX. 8. 27, Sat. IX. 5 p. 944 ). The 
unnetr at the direction of the adhraryu leads all out of the 
water ( the yajamftna or hotr being the first ). The yajamana 
and his wife put on fresh garments and come out. The 
cloth with which soma was enveloped is worn as a turban 
by the yajam&na and that in which soma stalks were tied is 
worn by the wife and both the pieces of cloth are donated 
later on in the Udavas&nlya isti to the adhvaryu ( Ap. XIIT. 
22. 3-4 ). The priests, the yajamftna and the wife hold each a 
fuel-stick of udumbara, mutter the Mahlya rk (viz. apama 
somam-amrfca abhuma, $g. VIII. 48. 3 ), proceed following the 
unnetr towards the sacrificial ground without looking back at 
the water, perform marjana in front of the cow-stable ( of the 
saorificer ) and place the fuel-stick ( carried by each ) on the 
ahavanlya with ' edhosi &c. ' ( Tai. S. I. 4. 45. 3 ) and wait upon 
that fire with ' apo anvacarisam ' ( Ap. XIII. 22. 6 quoting Tai. 
S. L 4. 45. 3 ). Then follows the Udayanlya ( the concluding 
is^i). It is performed in the pragvamsa (and not on the specially 
prepared uttaravedi). The procedure is like that for the 
prfiyanlys isti (already described on p. 1140). In the same sthall 
(pot) in which the prayanlya offering was cooked and to the bottom 
of whioh some remnants stick he takes the offering for this isti. 
The wife again ties round her waist the yoktra. Prayajas are 
optional and if not offered no ajya is taken in the juhu. The yajyas 
and anuv&kyas of the prayanlya become respectively the anuva- 
kyas and yajyas of the Udayanlya. The order of deities is different, 
viz. Agni is the first, Fathya Svasti the last for ajya offerings 
( Ap. XIII. 23. 4, Sat. IX 6. p. 450, Asv. VI. 14. 3 ). When the 
Udayanlya is finished the anubandhya rite follows"* (Ap. 
XIII. 23. 6, Sat. IX 6. p. 951). A barren cow is to be offered 
to Mitra and Varuna. The prooedure is the same as that of 
Nir&dha-pasu-bandha. Some sacrificed three anubandhya oows 
viz. to Mitra and Varuna, to the Visve Devas and to Brhaspati,

but Ap. ( XIIL 23. 6. 10 and 14 ) restricts them to Vajapeya, 
'Rajasuya and sattras. Est. ( X 9. 14-15 ) says that instead of 
the cow, a bull may be offered or only payasya may be offered 
to Mitra and Varuna."*' Ap. XIII. 24. 10 states that in place 
of the anubandhyft cow the followers of Rgveda offered amiksS 
to Mitra- Varuna and the offering was made by the hotr in front 
of the havirdhSna shed and all the ceremonies in the arohetype 
isti up to Ida were performed in that rite. After the anubandhya 
(or SmiksS) was offered came the five offerings called Devika 
viz. a cake on twelve potsherds to Dbatr and four oblations of 
rice cooked in milk in the four sthalls mentioned above ( in 
which soma had been placed ) to Anumati, Raka, Sinlvall and 
Kuhu (Asv. VI. 14. 15, Ap. XIII. 24.1-3). The yajamSna 
shaves bis hair and moustaohe near the southern side of the 
vedi (Ap. XIII. 23. 16). The ahavanlya fire is taken to the 
north outside the mahavedi in an earthen-ware vessel and the 
kusas strewn on the vedi are burnt thereon and the smoke 
issuing therefrom is invoked with a mantra (Sat. IX 6. p. 951), 
the adhvaryu offers on the fire ( of the kusas ) ground barley 
from his joined hands ( Ap. XIII. 24. 16-17 ). The fires are then 
deposited in the aranis by repeating ' ayam te yonih ' ( Rg. III. 
29. 10, Tai. S. I. 5. 2, Vaj. S. III. 14 ) as stated in Asv. III. 10. 5. 
Having given up the sacrificial ground he again produces fire 
by attrition to the north of the sacrificial ground and the 
udavasanlya is^i is performed. 2832 In this isti a cake baked on 
eight or five potsherds is offered to Agni ( Ap. XIII. 25. 5, Sat. 
1X6. p. 956). In this isti (Asv. VI. 14. 24) everything is 
done as in the punaradheya, but the mantras are muttered 
inaudibly in all oases ezoept the last anuySja. A bull is the 
fee or as much gold as will purchase a bull. Instead of this 
isti an offering of ajya was made by some ( Ap. XIII. 25. 7-8 ) 
from the juhu in which twelve ladlings were made with sruva 
with * idam visnur ' ( Rg. I. 22. 17 ). 

2631. In modern times no cow is sacrificed, but only SmiksS is 
offered instead. Among the actions forbidden in tbe Kali age is the 
slaughter of anubandhyS. ' inn f^fjlwrT sft TT3HWimi}sft *T • 9*n-

1202 History of Dharmaiastra [ Oh. XXXIII 

Ingenious theories have been advanced by European 
scholars about the origin of the soma sacrifices. Considera- 
tions of spaoe forbid the discussion of this topio here. Those 
who are interested in these speculations may consult Prof. 
Eggeling's Introduction to S. B. E. vol. 26 pp. XI-XXIII 
( where several European works are cited and questions about 
soma are discussed), L' Agnistoma (pp. 481-490), Prof. Keith's 
' Religion and philosophy of the Veda &c. ' pp. 331-332 and the 
works cited there. With the greatest respeot for all these 
learned and industrious European savants it must be said that 
none of the theories has any great plausibility or carries con- 
viction. The cult of the soma is at least Indo-Iranian and no 
sure traces are left in the anoient Indian religious books of the 
origin of that cult. We have simply the institution of the 
sacrifice before us and all else is imagination and speculation. 
One important question is the relation of the plant soma to 
the moon (also oalled soma as in Bg. X. 85. 1 and 2). The moon 
is generally called ' mas ' or ' candramas' in the Bg. ( Bg. V. 51. 
15, X 85. 19, VIII. 94. 2, X. 12. 7.X. 68.10). In Bg. VIII. 
82. 8 occurs the very striking simile MM ' Soma that is seen 
among the ( soma ) vessels as the moon in waters' and the 
Atharvaveda ( XI. 6. 7 ) states that the god whom people call 
Candramas is soma. In several places soma is addressed as 
indu ( whioh oertainly means the moon in later literature ). 
Vide Bg. IX. 86. 24, 26, 37, VIII. 48. 2, 4, 5, 12, 13. It is said 
that soma grew on Mujavat ( Bg. X. 34. 1 ) and in the Arjlklya 
country ( Bg. VIII. 64. 11 ) on the river Susoma. Even in the 
Bgveda soma appears to have become mythioal. In Bg. IX. 86.24 
soma is said to have been brought from heaven by Suparna 
(eagle or bird?) and in 1.93. 6 by a Syena ( hawk ). Another 
matter to be noted is that the soma plant had certainly become 
rare, "** if not unobtainable, in the times of the Brahmanas. 
The Sat. Br. IV, 5. 10 mentions several substitutes for soma, 
among whioh are Phalguna plants having brown flowers,

8. p. OXIX ) holds that the question of the identification of the soma 
plant cannot really be finally determined. 



Oh. XXXIII J Agmstomarsoma plant 1203 

Dub plant and greenish kusas. The Tandya Br. says ' If one 
does not secure soma, one may extract juice from putlkas*. 8m 
'jai. (III. 6. 40 and VI. 3. 13-17 ) states that this passage res- 
tricts a saorifioer when no soma is available to putlkas and 
prevents the employment of other substanoes similar to soma 
and in VI. 3. 31 he declares that putlkas are the proper prati- 
nidhi ( substitute ) for soma and not any other substance even if 
it may be more similar to soma than putlkas, but that if both 
putlka and soma are unavailable then another substance similar 
to soma may be employed. Asv. ( VI. 8. 5-6 ) states that if 
soma stalks be not available then putlka stalks and Phftlguna 
plant should be used or other plants mixed with putlkas may be 
employed (and the com. adds that those others are durva, kusa 
and the like). In the Decoan the plant that is taken to repre- 
sent soma when soma sacrifices are rarely performed is called 
'ransera' (in Marathi) whioh grows in the hills of the Deocan.

CHAPTER XXXIV 

OTHER SOMA SACRIFICES 

The sutraB speak of seven forms ( samsthSs ) of soma 
sacrifices. These seven forms are Agnis^oma, Atyagnis^oma, 
Ukthya, Sodasin, Vajapeya, Atiratra and Aptoryama (according 
to Kat X. 9. 27, Asv.VI.ll. 1, Lftt. V. 4. 24). The first of 
these has been desoribed In some detail above. Owing to 
restrictions of space only a few words can be said about the 
other soma sacrifices. All sutras do not state the same number 
of soma sacrifices. Ap. XIV. 1.1 and Sat. IX, 7. p. 958 expressly 
say that Ukthya, Sodasin, Atiratra and Aptoryama are the 
modifications of Agnistoma and the commentaries of both point 
out that there were several views on the number of the modifica- 
tions of the Agnistoma. In the Brahmanas the Agnistoma, 
TJkthya, Sodasin and Atiratra are generally mentioned as forms 
of Jyotistoma ( vide Sat. Br. IV. 6. 3. 3, Tai. Br. I. 3. 2 and 4, 
which last mentions Vfijapeya also ). 

Ukthya or Uktha.^ In this there are three more stotras 
( called uktha stotras ) and sastras ( called uktha sastras ) to 
be chanted and recited in the evening pressing, thus bringing 
the total of stotras and sastras to fifteen (Ait. Br. 14. 3, 
Asr. VI. 1. 1-3 ). Ap. XIV. 1. 2 says that the Ukthya, Sodasin, 
Atiratra and Aptoryama are respectively performed by him 
who desires cattle, vigour, progeny and cattle, all objects. In the 
Ukthya an additional victim, a goat ( over and above those 
offered in Agnistoma ) is sacrificed for Indra and Agni on the 
pressing day. Vide Ait. Br. XIV. 3, Asv. VI. 1. 1-3, Ap. XIV. 1, 
Sat. IX. 7. pp. 958-959, Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 251 n, S. B. E. 
vol. 41, pp. XIV-XVI. 

Sofaiin. In this sacrifice in addition to the fifteen stotras and 
fifteen sastras of the Ukthya there is an additional stotra and a 
corresponding sastra called Sodasin in the trtlya savana (both the 
sastra and the sacrifice have the same name, as the com. on Asv. 
VI. 2. 1 says). There is an additional oup in the morning or at 
all pressings according to some ( Ap. XIV. 2. 4-5 ). It is made 
of khadira wood and is quadrangular in shape ( Sat. IX. 7. 
p. 960 ). The stotra for the sodasin oup is begun to be chanted 



Oh. XXXIV ] Other Soma Sacrifices 1205 

about sunset after the adhvaryu hands over a piece of gold to 
the sSma singer ( instead of kusa grass, Ap. XIV. 3. 1 ). Soma 
is* purchased for a cow that is of very small stature and has red- 
coloured ears. In this rite an additional victim viz. a ram is 
sacrificed for Indra. The fee is a reddish brown horse or a female 
mule. Vide Ait. Br. 16. 1-4, Asv. VI. 2-3, Ap. XIV. 2. 3 ff, 
Sat. IX. 7. pp. 959-962, Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 255-256n, S.B.E. 
vol. 41 pp. XVI-XVII for further details. 

Atyagnistoma. This form is obtained by adding the 
sodasistotra, the sodasin cup and an additional victim for 
Indra to what prevails in the Agnis^oma;' vide S.B.E. vol.41, 
p. XVII. 

Atiralra. This soma sacrifice is referred to even in the 
Rgveda ( VII. 103. 7 ). As this sacrifice is not finished in one 
day but only after the day and night pass away it is called 
AtirStra. Ap. X. 2. 4 notes that according to some the AtirStra 
is performed even before Agnisfrma. The AtirStra has 29 
stotras and 29 sastras. In this the additional stotras and 
sastras are repeated at night in four rounds ( called parySyas ) 
of three stotras and sastras. Asv. VI. 4. 10 points out these 
12 sastras. In this sacrifice the sastra called Asvina is recited, 
but before it six ahutis are offered at night. The Asvina-sastra 
closely follows the procedure of prStaranuvSka, must comprise 
at least a thousand verses and was to be recited till sunrise 
(vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. pp. 268-269n for description 
of this sastra ). At twilight is chanted a stotra appropriately 
called Sandhistotra ( Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. pp. 266-267n ). 
It is in the Rathantara melody. If the sun did not 
rise by that time the hotr was to continue reciting Rg. 
I. 112 and when the sun rose he was to recite saurya hymns 
( viz. Rg. X. 158, I. 50. 1-9, 1. 115, X. 37 ). A fourth animal 
viz. an ewe ( or ram aocording to some ) is offered to Saras- 
vatl on the pressing day ( Sat. IX. 7. p. 963 ). The principal 
camasas in the night are offered to Indra Apisarvara ( Sat. IX. 
7. p. 963. ). A purodaaa on two potsherds is offered by the 
pratiprasthatr to Asvins ( Asv. VI. 5. 23 and Sat. IX. 7 p. 965 ) 
and a soma cup is offered to the Asvins. Jai. X. 8. 6 notes that 
as a vedio passage says * there is no sodasin oup in AtirStra * 
and another says there is, the first is a prohibition and there is 
an option. For details vide Ait. Br. 14. 3 and 16. 5-7 Asv VI 
4-5, Sat. IX 7 pp. 662-665, Ap. XIV. 3. 8-XIV. 4. 11, S.B.E* 
vol. 41 pp. XVII-XX • 



1206 Hiatory of Dharmatosbra { Oh. XXXIV 

Aptoryama — This sacrifice is similar to Atiratra of which 
it appears to be an amplification. Only there are four 
additional stotras ( i. e. 33 in all ) and four additional sastras 
recited by the hofcr and his assistants, and there are four 
oamasas in relation to these last respectively for Agni, Indra, 
Visve Devas and Visnu (Ap. XIV. 4. 12-16, Sat. IX. 7 
pp. 966-967, Sjln. XV. 5. 14-18 and Sat. X 8. p. 1111 ). Accord- 
ing to 5.9V. ( IX. 11. 1 ) he whose cattle do not live 
or who desires to seoure cattle of good breed should 
perform the Aptoryama. Asv. ( IX. 9. 22-23 ) says that in this 
the fee is more than a thousand ( cows ) up to an unlimited 
number and the hotr gets a special gift of a white chariot (plated 
with silver ) to which female muleB are yoked. This sacrifice 
is generally joined with others. The Tandya Br. ( XX 3. 4-5 ) 
states that the rite is so called because by its performance one 
secures whatever object one desires ( from ' ftp ' to obtain ), 

Vajapeya—{ lit. food and drink, or drink of strength or of 
food or of a race ). 8Me Though this rite is said to be a form 
of Jyotisfama and though it follows the procedure of Sodasin 
(Ap. XVIII. 1. 4 ) it has so many special features of its own 
that it may be said to be an independent sacrifice. One chara- 
cteristic feature is that the number 17 is predominant in this 
sacrifice (Ap. XVIII. 1.5, Tandya XVIII. 7. 5), viz. there are 
17 stotras and 17 sastras, the 17th being the Vajapeya stotra 
and sastra, 17 animals sacrificed for PrajSpati, 17 objects 
distributed as fee, the yupa ( of bilva or khadira wood ) was 17 
aratnis in length, at the time of enveloping the yupa with a 
girdle in this rite 17 pieces of cloth were employed for the 
purpose ( Ap. XVIII. 1. 12 ), it lasted for 17 days ( for 13 days 
dlksa, 3 upasad days and one pressing day ) or there were 17 
dlksSs (and then the rite lasted for 21 days). Vide Asv. IX. 9. 2-3 
and Ap. XVIII. 1. 6-7. Another feature was that there were 
seventeen cups of sura ( wine ) for Prajapati as well as 17 cups 
of soma. Another peculiarity was that there were seventeen 
chariots to which horses were yoked and a race was run, when 
seventeen drums that were arranged on the northern ir<m of 
the vedi were simultaneously beaten ( Ap. XVIII. 4. 4 and 7, 
Est. XIV. 3. 14 ) to the west of the Sgnldhra shed.

This complicated rite was undertaken by dee who desired 
overlordship (adhipatya, as As v. IX. 9. 1 says) or prosperity (Ap. 
XVIII. 1. 1 ) or svarajya ( the position of Indra or uncontrolled 
dominion ). It was performed in the autumn. 8687 Only a bra- 
hmana or a ksatriya could perform it, but not a vaisya 8638 (Kat. 
XIV. 1. 1 and Ap. XVIII. 1. 1 ). In the case of a brahmana the 
reward aimed at must have been the attainment of' the position 
of a super-eminently learned or prosperous man. All the priests, 
the sacrificer and his wife wear chains of gold, and Asv. IX. 
9. 5 adds that the chain worn by the hotr has a hundred lotus- 
like pendants studded with precious stones. The golden chain 
worn by each priest becomes part of his fee. Besides the 
three viz. for Agni, Indra and Agni and for Indra ( a ram ), a 
barren cow for Maruts and ewe for SarasvatI and 17 hornless, 
young and virile goats of one colour ( or all of dark colour ) 
for Prajapati are offered in this rite ( Ap. XVIII. 2. 12-13, Kat: 
XIV. 2. 11-13 ). For the 17 cups of wine ( called parisrut, 
prepared from several herbs ) the pratiprasthatr prepares a 
separate mound ( khara ) to the west of the axle of the southern 
havirdhana cart on which the wine cups made of clay are to 
be kept. The soma cups are to the east of the axle of the cart 
and wine cups to'the west and they are to be kept separate. 
Aocording to Kat. ( XIV. 1. 17 and 26 ) it is the nest? priest 
that gets ready the mound and the wine cups. In the midst of 
the wine cups a golden cup of honey is placed ( Tai. Br. I, 3. 3, 
Kat. XIV. 2. 9 ). The wine is purchased ready-made in 
exchange for lead from a long-haired man at the time when 
soma stalks are purohased, or the material, for making wine is 
bought, and is entered into the sacrificial enolosure by the 
southern door and is boiled on the daksina fire ( Kat. 
XIV. 1. 14-17 ). The yQpa has four angles ( and not eight as 
elsewhere ) and has no top protruding beyond the oasala, but 
its top is even and is slightly depressed in the middle. The 
oasala of the yupa ( which is 17 aratnis high ) is made of wheat 
flour ( Tai. Br. I. 3. 7, Ap. XVIII. 1. 8, Kat. XIV. 1. 22). A 
race is run in connection with the mid-day pressing in the

following way ( Ap. XVIII. 3. 3 and 12-13 ). The Tai. Br. 
I. 3. 2 refers to the race won by Bfhaspafci and connects the 
Vajapeya with that race. Seventeen ohariots are got ready to 
the east of the ahavanlya with their yokes to the north or east. 
One of them is the saorificer's chariot to which three horses are 
yoked with mantras and a fourth runs along the third but is 
not yoked. These horses are made to smell the earn of wild 
rice ( nlv&ra ) which is meant for Brhaspati. To the sixteen 
other chariots four horses each are yoked outside the vedi but 
without mantras ( com. on Eat. XIV. 3. 11 ). A ksatriya ( raja- 
putra according to Ap. ) shoots an arrow from the space 
between the cafcvala and utkara and notes the spot where it 
falls, from which he shoots an arrow a second time. This is 
done seventeen times. On the spot where the arrow falls at the 
17th shooting, he plants a post of udumbara wood as the goal 
for the chariot race ( Ap. XVIII. 3. 12 and Kat. XIV. 3. 1-11 
and 16-17 ). When the race starts, the brahma priest fixes an 
udumbara chariot-wheel ( having seventeen spokes according 
to Kat. V. 12. 11 ) on an axle (or udumbara post navel-high) 
implanted on a spot between the catvala and the utkara (or near 
the utkara ) and ascends on that wheel with ' at the impulse of 
God Savitr may I win vaja (vigour, food or race) with the help of 
Brhaspati, the winner of vaja ' (Ap. XVIII. 4. 8, Kat. XIV. 3. 12 
which mentions Vaj. S. IX. 10 ). When the wheel is revolved 
from left to right ( it is revolved thrice ) the brahma chants the 
Vaji-saman S6S » (Ap. XVIII. 4. 11, Asv. IX. 9. 8. Lat. V. 12. 14 )• 
Aocording to Lat. ( V. 12. 13 ) the brahma only rests his arms 
on the wheel. The yajamana occupies the chariot on which 
mantras were recited and the adhvaryu ( or his pupil ) also gets 
into it to instruot the yajamana to repeat the Vedic formulae 
he has to utter. Other persons ( called vftjasrt ) join in the race 
and sit in the other sixteen ohariots and a ksatriya or vaisya 
sits in one of them and the race starts with speed. All the 
seventeen drums are beaten on the northern sroni of the vedi to 
urge on the horses. All the horses are made to smell the caru 
of wild rice ( nlv&ra ) oooked in 17 pots for Brhaspati. The 
chariot of the sacrificer is in front and the others follow his, 
but do not overtake it. The adhvaryu makes the yajamana

recite the formulae of viotory such as ' agnirekaksarena ' ( Vfij. 
fr VIII. 31-34, Tai. S. I. 1. 11). When the chariot reaches 
the goal, the chariot is taken to its north and then turned 
round to the south. All the chariots return to the 
sacrificial ground and the horses are again made to 
smell the caru of nlvaras and a homa is offered for dischar- 
ging the drums ( dundubhi-vimooanlya-homa ). A berry 
( krsnala, gold of that weight ) is given to each of those that 
rode the chariots, but that gold is taken back from them and 
is donated to the brahma who also receives the golden jar of 
honey (K&t. XIV. 4. 17, Ap. XVIII. 5. 5 ) after it is presented 
to and taken back from the ksatriya or vaisya. The cups of 
soma are taken up by the priests ( the adhvaryu taking the 
hotr-camasa ), and the camasaohvaryus take up their cups; 
while the pratiprasthatr takes up the principal wine cup and 
the other sixteen are taken up by those who joined in the race. 
The adhvaryu starts towards the east with the soma cups with 
' sam prcah. ' ( Tai. Br. I. 3. 3 ), the pratiprasthatr to the west 
with the wine cups and stands near the marjallya shed. After 
the adhvaryu offers the soma cups, the wine cups are shaken 
and given to the sixteen persons who took part in the raoe and 
they quaff them on the southern sroni of the vedi. According 
to Est. (XIV. 3. 20 and XIV. 4. 16) the ksatriya or vaisya who 
sat in one of the chariots receives all the wine cups. When 
preparations are made to chant the Mahendra stotra, the nestr 
requests the wife to put on a short undergarment of darbha 
and the yajamana wears a silken garment ( tarpyam ) EM0 inside 
the garment which he wears as a dlksita. A ladder is raised 
against the yQpa to its north or south (Eat. XIV. 5. 5) and 
when the sacrificer climbs to the top of the yupa a dialogue 
ensues between the sacrificer and his wife (Kat. XIV. 5. 6-11, 
Ap. XVIII. 5. 9-11 ). The sacrificer addresses 'wife, come, let 
us ascend to heaven*. The wife responds ' let us ascend*. They 
engage in this dialogue thrioe. According to Kat. XIV. 5. 8 
both husband and wife climb to the top of the yupa, while accor- 
ding to Ap. (XVIII. 4. 12) only the husband does so who finally 
says 'out of us both I shall ascend to heaven*. On reaohing the 
top he touohes the oasala of wheat flour and mutters ' we reached 
the heaven, the gods ' (Tai. S. I. 7. 9. 2, Vaj. S. IX. 21 ). Thence 
he looks at his house with ' May I live long with my children '

( Tai. S. I. 7. 9. 2 ) or in the several directions with V&j. S. 
IX. 22 ( Kfit. XIV. 5. 11 ). Vaisyas ( explained as his children, 
by the com. on Kat. XIV. 5. 12 ) throw up to him 17 bags of 
salt or saltish earth enveloped in leaves of asvattha or ( accord- 
ing to Ap. XVIII. 5. 16-18 ) the adhvaryu, brahmS, hotr and 
udgfttr raise up the bags to his faoe on long poles respectively 
from the east, south, west and north with mantras ( referring 
to food, vaja and winning of vaja) He receives them and 
descends. He plants his right foot on a pieoe of gold placed 
over a goat-skin spread in front of the yupa on the ground with 
its neok to the east and hairy side outside and his left foot on 
the skin itself and from thence he sits down on a oouoh placed 
on the west side of the uttaravedi. The offerings of the omentum 
and other limbs of the animal for Saras vatl and of other 
animals are made, the wild rioe caru for Brhaspati is offered 
and the priests partake of the remnants as usual. The animals 
for Prajapati are offered at the time of the mid-day pressing. 
Before the offering to Svistakrfc of the wild rice caru 
is made water and milk are poured in a vessel of udumbara 
and food of seventeen kinds of grains or of as many as the 
sacrificer remembers except one is also put therein and seven 
offerings are made of all this with the sruva and the yajamSna 
is sprinkled with the rest (Kat XIV. 5. 20-24). He does 
not eat throughout his life-time the food of the one kind of 
grain that was omitted. The adhvaryu declares thrice after 
taking the name of the sacrificer ' he, so and so, is saihraf ' 
(overlord). Ap. XVIII. 7. 18 says that on performing vajapeya a 
man is entitled to use the white parasol. After the performance 
of Vajapeya the sacrificer had to observe certain rules of 
conduct (vide La*. VIII. 12. 1-4, Ap. XVIII. 7. 16-17). He should 
act like a ksatriya ( i. e. he may study and make gifts, but 
should not teach or accept gifts ), he should not rise to receive 
or doabhivadana or oarry mi errands for or sit on the same 
couoh with a person who had not performed that sacrifice. The 
adhvaryu reoeives the horses and the ohariot in which the 
sacrificer sat ( Ap. XVIIL 3. 10 ) and receives also all the 17 
clothes with which the yupa was enveloped. As to other fees 
there is some divergence among Ap. XVIIL 3. 4-5, Asv. IX. 9, 
14-17, Kat. XIV. 2. 29-33 and La}. VIII. 11. 16-22. Asv. says 
that 1700 cows, 17 chariots to which horses are yoked, seventeen

horses, seventeen animals which men ride, seventeen draught 
Oxen, seventeen oarts, 17 slave-girls decked with golden niskas 
round their necks, 17 elephants with golden girths-these consti- 
tute the fee in Vajapeya and Asv. suggests other alternatives. 
Ap. XVIII. 3. 4 is almost the same but adds seventeen goats 
and ewes. La^ ( VIII. 11. 16-18 ) is also practically the same as 
Asv. but adds several alternatives about cows. In the Kuruva- 
japeya ( variously explained in the com. ) cows donated are 
only 17, in other Vajapeyas 1700 or 17000 cows may be given. 
Lat. further says that the gifts may be equally divided among 
all the priests, that the chariot ocoupied by the sacrificer over 
wbioh yajus mantras were recited and the couoh with its 
coverlet are given to the udgatr, the goat-skin with the golden 
pieoe is taken by the hotr. 

It will have been noticed that this sacrifice has several 
picturesque elements in it. In the race and the drinking bout 
of seventeen cups there is a popular element. In the climbing 
to the top of the yupa by tbe sacrificer and in the boiled wild 
rice for Brhaspati there is a symbolism of holiness and 
eminence. 

Asv. IX. 9. 19 sayB that after performing Vajapeya a king 
should perform Rajasuya and a brahmana should perform 
Brhaspatisava, m8 while Ap. XVIII. 7. 15 recommends the 
SautramanI after it. Kafc. ( XIV. 1. 2-8 ) states various views. 

Jaimini in several adhikaranas deals with the sruti texts about 
Vajapeya. They may be briefly indicated here. In I. 4. 6-8 he 
shows that in the sentence ' one desiring to secure overlordship 
should sacrifice with Vajapeya* the word Vajapeya is the name 
of a rite ( karmanSmadheya ) and that that sentenoe does 
not lay down some subordinate matter ( such as what material 
is to be used ) in the model sacrifice and that the word vajapeya 
does not mean gruel or similar substance. In Jai. III. 1. 18 
it is said that the text ' of the Vajapeya the yupa is 17 aratnis ' 

2642. According to Jai. IV. 3. 29-31 the Brhaspatisava ia an anga 
of VSjapeya and the sentence yi afl< > >g i f fwfitar^W tsN does not lay 
down a time for the performance of that rite. Vide Tai. Br. II. 7. 1 
and Ap. XXII. 7. 5 ff, \4v. IX. 5. 3 ffi for f^wfiw* which is a kind of 
EkSba soma sacrifice and whioh is to be performed by one who desires 
overlordship ( Sdhipatya ) or spiritual eminence ( brahmavarcasa ) 
according to Asv. IX. 5. 3 or by one who desires to be tbe purohita of a 
king (Tai. Br. 11.7. 1 ). 



1J12 History of Dharmaiastra I Ch. XXXIV 

means thai; the yupa required for the sacrifice of animals 
in the Vajapeya is to be 17 aratnis high and not that any other, 
thing like the Sodasipatra was to be 17 aratnis. When the 
Tai. Br. ( I. 3. 4 ) says that seventeen animals are to be killed 
for Prajapati, they are 17 separate yagas and not one rite 
( karma ). When it is said that oaru is prepared in milk in 
seventeen saravas ( pots ), the method of taking outhandfuls 
of grains ( as in dar&apurnamasa ) is not applicable. Jai. says 
( in XI. 4. 30 ) that the vessel ( kumbhl ), the sula and the spit 
for roasting the omentum are the same for all the viotims, that 
the omentum of the victim for Prajapati is not sprinkled with 
the ajya remaining after the prayaja offerings are made ( IV. 1. 
33-39 ) and that the chariot which was occupied by the sacrificer 
is to be specially given to adhvaryu and not any one of the 
seventeen chariots i. e. there is a restrictive rule about the share 
in chariots for the adhvaryu, while there is none as to the other 
priests ( X. 3. 74-75 ). m * 

The Agnistoma and the other forms of soma sacrifices so 
far described are ekaha ( one day ) soma sacrifices i. e. in them 
soma is offered in cups on one day thrice ( in the morning, mid- 
day and evening). The sutras ( e. g. Asv. IX. 5-11, Baud. 
XVIII. 1-10, Kat. XXII ), however, mention and describe 
several other one day soma sacrifices, such as Brhaspatisava, 
Gosava, Syena, Udbhid, Visvajit, Vrafcyastoma (already des- 
cribed above on pp. 345-347 ) which are left out for want of 
space. ""

2644. The Visvajit from among the ekahas ia a very striking sacri- 
fice. In this the sacrificer either gives • thousand cows or all wealth 
after separating the share of the eldest son (and excepting land and 
tfUdras who serve him as a duty ). Jai. sets out several propositions 
about this sacrifice in IV. 3. 10-18, VI. 7. 1-20, VII. 3.. 6-11, X. 6. 13. 
After this rite, the sacrificer stays three days at the root of an ndum- 
baia tree subsisting on fruits and roots, for three days in a settlement 
of nisgdas ( where he may subsist on nivaras i. e. on rice, tfyamSka and 
the flesh of deer ), for three days among vaUyas (jana, also explained as 
" persons of another gotra ':) and three days with ksatriyas:(saraSnajana,

Cb. XXXIV ] Ahina sacrifices 1213 

The ahlna sacrifices 8M ' are those the duration of which is 
two to twelve days of soma pressing, which always end with 
an atiratra and which together with the dlkaa and upasad days 
should not extend beyond a month. They should be begun on 
a Full Moon day. Among them there are groups of sacri- 
fices that last -for two days, three days (e. g. Gargatriratra ), 
four days, five days ( called pancaratras of which Paficasara- 
dlya is one ), sadahas and so on. Among the numerous rites 
called ahlnas, the Asvamedha and Dvadasaha deserve notice. 
The Asvamedha will be described later on. The Dvadasaha 
is both an ahlna and a sattra ( Asv. X. 5. 2 ). There are several 
varieties of Dvadasaha, one being called Bharata-dvadasaha 
( Asv. X. 5. 8., Ap. XXI. 14. 5 ). The twelve days of the Dva- 
dasaha as a sattra are constituted byithe Prayanlya ( the com- 
mencing rite, an Atiratra ), Prst,hya Sadaha" 46 ( 6 days ), Chan- 
domas which are Ukthyas ( 3 days ) and a tenth day which is

also expalined as sagotras ). For a year he should not refuse what is 
offered but should not beg. Vide Kst. XXII. 1. 9-33, LSt. VIII. 2. 1-13. 
The Go9ava is a very strange rite. The Tai. Br. II. 7. 6 briefly describes 
it. One who desires avSrSjya may perform it and Ap. ( XXII. 12. 12-20 
and XXII. 13. 1-3 ) states that for a year thereafter he should be 
paduvrata (act like cattle ) i. o. should drink water like them and cut 
grass (with his teeth ) an ;1 approach his mother &c. ( probably only as

the sacrificer direota the priests to finish the sacrifice and enters fire.

an Atyagnistoma ( called Avivakya, on which no speaking or 
dispute about errors is allowed ) and the Udayanlya ( cotir 
eluding rite, which again is an Atiratra). The prinoipal 
differences between the Dvadasaha as an ahlna and a sattra 
are: (1) a sattra oan be performed only by brahraanas, while a 
dvadasaha may be performed by any one of the first three 
varnas ; (2) the sattra may extend over even long periods ( such 
as a year or more ), while a dvadasaha oannot so extend ; (3,) in 
the sattra the distinction of yajamana and priests does not 
exist but all are yajamanas and all work as priests, while in 
dvadasaha that distinction exists ; (4) ( as a consequence of the 
above) in a sattra there are no daksinas. Eat. XII. 1. 4 states 
that wherever in the vedio texts the words 'upayanti ' and ' asate ' 
occur it is a sign of a ' sattra ' ( and so in that oase the rules 
about sattras will apply ) but where the word ' yajate ' or 
' yajayet ' is used it is a sign of an ahlna. In an ahlna only 
the last day is an Atiratra, but in a sattra both the first and last 
days are Atiratras ( Kat. XII. 1. 6 ). 

It is now necessary to say something about a few other 
striking sacrifices. 

Bajasuya.— -This is strictly not a purely soma sacrifice, but 
it is a most complex ceremony extending over a very long 
period (more than two years) and comprising a number of 
separate istfs ( like the one to Anumati), Soma sacrifices ( like 
Pavitra) and animal sacrifices (Kat. XV. 1. 3). Even the 
briefest statement of the several rites will occupy many pages. 
An attempt will be made to indicate only a few salient features. 

This ceremony could be performed only M47 by a ksatriya. 
There was a difference of view, some holding that it could be 
performed only by him who had not celebrated the Vajapeya 
(Kat. XV. 1. 2), while others held that it should be celebrated 
after^ Vajapeya ( Asv. IX. 9. 19 ). In the Sat. Br. IX. 3. 4.8 it is 
said *by performing the Rajasuya one becomes a king ( rajan )

Soma is called rsjan. 



Ch. XXXIV ] Rajasniya 1215 

and by the Vajapeya an emperor ( samrat ) and the position of 
the king is (obtained) first and thereafter of emperor. ' On the 
first day of the bright half of Phalguna the sacrificer under- 
goes dlksa for a soma sacrifice called Pavitra, which follows 
the prooedure of Agnistoma (L&t. IX. 1. 2, Asv. IX. 3. 2, Kat. 
XV. 1.6). There was difference of opinion as to the number 
of dlksa days ( La}. IX. 1. 8, Kat. XV. 1. 4 ). The Abhisecanlya 
oeremony whioh is the principal among the rites of Rajasuya 
took place exactly a year after the Pavitra sacrifice was 
commenced (La^. IX. 1.4). At the end of the Abhiseoanlya 
the sacrifioer did not actually enter into water for the final bath 
( avabhrtha ), but wearing shoes made of boar-skin he repaired 
from the sacrificial ground ( devayajana ) to the water, put into 
the water blaok antelope horn or the foot portion of a black 
antelope skin and returned wearing shoes of blaok antelope 
skin ( La*. IX 1. 23-24 ), 

There are five offerings commencing the next day after the 
Pavitra sacrifice, one each on one day. Then on the Full Moon 
of Phalguna there is an istf to Anumati ( a purodasa being 
offered ). Vide Kat. XV. 1. 9 and Ap. XVIII. 8. 10." There is 
an offering to Nirrti prepared from the particles of grains that 
fall to the west of the samya from the mill-stone when the 
grains for the purodasa to Anumati are being ground. The 
partioles are taken in the sruva and a firebrand being lighted 
from the dakstna fire, the offering is made to the south 
of the vihara on that fire-brand or on some saltish land. On 
the full moon day of Phalguna are begun the caturmasyas (i.e. 
first the Vaisvadeva, then after four months Varunapraghasas 
and so on ). This goes on for one year. Between the parvana 
of the cfiturmasyas, the monthly full moon and new moon 
sacrifices are performed. The oaturmasyas come to an end with 
the Sunaslrlya parva on the first of the bright half of Phalguna. 
After that several rites follow such as the Paftoavatlya in 
five fires in the four directions and in the middle ( Ap. XVIII. 
9. 10-11, Kat. XV. 1. 20-21 ), the Apamarga-homa ( Ap. XVIII. 
9. 15-20, Kat. XV. 2. 1 ff. ). Then there are twelve offerings 
called ' ratninam" 48 havlrhsi ' performed on twelve days one 

2648. The ' ratnius ' are enumerated somewhat differently in 
different texts, though some are common to all. Vide Tai. S. I. 8. 9. 1-2,

after another in the houses of the ' ratnas ' ( jewels ) viz. of the 
sacrifioer himself, his queens and state functionaries ( Kajfc. 
XV. 3 and Ap. XVIII. 10). The deity to whom an offering is made 
is appropriate to the person in whose house the offering is 
made and the offerings and fees also differ. The twelve persons 
( according to Eat. ) are the sacrifioer, the commander of the 
army, the purohita, the crowned queen, the suta ( minstrel ? ), 
gramanl ( village headman ), the ksattr ( chamberlain ), sarhgra- 
hltr ( treasurer or charioteer ? ), aksavSpa ( superintendent of 
gambling ), govikarta ( hunter ? ), duta or palSgala ( courier ), 
parivrkti ( the discarded queen ) and the deities respectively 
are Indra, Agni Anlkavat, Brhaspati, Aditi, Varuna, Maruts, 
Savitr, Asvins, Rudra ( for both aksavapa and govikarta ), Agni, 
Nirrfci ( the offering in this case is a oaru of black rice husked 
with the nails ). The daksinas also vary ( vide Ap. XVIII. 10. 
15-30, Kat. XV. 3. 16-34). Then follow several offerings. Then 
comes the Abhisecanlya rite which is the central ceremony in 
Rajasuya and which lasts for five days ( one day dlksa, three 
days upasads and onesutya day of soma pressings). The dlksa of 
Abhisecanlya ( anointing rite ) is performed on the first of 
Caitra. It is performed on the southern part of the sacrificial 
ground while the Dasapeya is performed on the northern 
portion. In the Abhisecanlya and Dasapeya the hotr must be 
of the Bhrgugotra ( Tandya Br. XVIII. 9. 2, Kat. XV. 4. 1, San. 
XV. 13. 2). The Abhisecanlya follows the procedure of the Ukthya. 
Soma is bought for both Abhisecanlya and Dasapeya at the same 
time, but half of it (for Dasapeya) is deposited, after being carried 
in a oart, in the house of the brahma priest. Then there are eight 
offerings of caru called Devasu-havlmsi viz. to Savitr, Agni 
Grhapati, Soma Vanaspati, Brhaspati, Indra, Rudra, Mitra, 
Varuna. According to Ap. XVI II. 12. 7-8 after these eight offer- 
ings the brahma priest announces to the ' ratnins ' that the 
saorificer is their king and refers to the tribes or people occupying 
the country."" Vide Kat. XV. 4. 15-17 also. At the end of ida 
in the case of these caru offerings the priest brings waters of 
seventeen kinds in seventeen vessels of udumbara wood, viz. 
of the Sarasvatl river, flowing water of a river, water from 
ripples produced by the entrance of a man or animal, water

from a river drawn against the current, water of the sea, of ocean 
waves, of whirl-pools, of deep steady reservoirs always exposed 
to the sun, rain water in sunshine before it falls on the ground, 
of a lake, of a well, of frost &o. (Eat. XV. 4. 21-48, Ap. XVIII 
13. 1-18 ). All the waters are poured into a vat of udumbara 
which is placed near the seat of Maitr&varuna. After the 
Marutvatlya cup is offered in the Ukthya rite, he spreads to the 
east of the vessel of water a tiger skin on the western end of 
which lead is placed. Six homas called Partha m,) are offered 
( Ap. XVIII. 15. 8, Kfit. XV. 5. 34 ) and then with a gold piece 
tied in two kusa blades the water in the big vessel is cleansed 
( that is utpavana is performed ) and is distributed in four 
vessels made of palasa, udumbara, nyagrodha and asvattha. 
The sacrificer wears a silken garment ( tarpya, explained by 
Kat. XV. 5. 7-11 ), a white turban ( one end of which hangs 
from the shoulder) and a mantle. The sacrificer recites the 
Avid formulae"*' ( Ap. XVIII. 14. 10, Kat. XV. 5. 21, which 
refers to Vaj. S. X. 9 ). The adhvaryu gives a strung bow and 
three arrows to the sacrificer, who puts a copper piece in the 
mouth of a long haired man ( eunuoh ) for averting evil ( from 
spirits and snakes ? ) ; vide Vaj. S. X 10. The sacrificer treads 
upon the piece of lead and brushes it away with his foot and 
stands on the tiger-skin with a gold piece under his foot and has 
a fillet of gold on his head. The saorifioer holds up his arms. 
He strides in the quarters. The sacrificer stands facing the east 
and the adhvaryu, standing in front of him, first sprinkles him 
with-the holy water oontained in the vessel of palasa, the other 
priests follow viz. the brahma sprinkles him from the right 
with water in udumbara vessel and so on. Besides, the king's 
brother ( Kat. XV 5. 30) or another ksatriya ( Ap. XVIH. 16. 3 ) 
sprinkles him with water from the udumbara vessel, a friendly 
ksatriya from the third vessel and a vaisya from the fourth 
( Ap. XVIII. 16. 3-5 says a ksatriya sprinkles water from 
udumbara vessel, a vaisya sprinkles from behind the king with 
water from asvattha vessel and a friend from the common 
people sprinkles from the north side with water in the nyagrodha 

2650. The Sat. Br. V. 3. 5. 4. connects these offerings with Prthu 
Vainya (the first consecrated king of men). The mantras are in 
Vsj. S. X. 5. 

2651. In the Tai. 8. 1. 8. 12. 2 the livid formulae are interesting 
and they are: M i flNlfH rTfNrfe* T^ — «rr>3 mumftuf r yraft arrftirr

vessel ). These aotions are probably symbolic of the consent 
of all people to the anointing. The saorifioer rubs with the 
antelope horn over the whole of his body the holy water 
sprinkled over him ( Kfit. XV. 6. 8 ). According to Kat. XV. 6. 
1-2 at this stage or after the dioe play ( to be desoribed later ) 
the hofcr priest sitting on a cushion inlaid with gold recites the 
story of Sunahsepa"" for the Bacrificer'B benefit. Ap. XVIII, 
19. 10 plaoes this recital after the dice-play. Asv. IX. 3. 9 says 
that the story of Sunahsepa is recited to the anointed king 
after the marutvatlya sastra in the Abhisecanlya rite ( and 
before the Niskevalya sastra), the king being seated on a 
golden cushion and surrounded by his son and ministers. 
The adhvaryu also sits on a cushion inlaid with gold and 
utters the responses (pratigara) uttering 'om' (as the pratigara) 
at the end of each rk and ' tatha ' at the end of each gatha. mt 
At the end of the recitation the sacrificer donates a hundred or 
a thousand cows to the hot? and to the adhvaryu and donates 
also their respective cushions. The king takes three strides 
called Visnukrama on the tiger-hide. All the remnants of the 
anointing waters are poured in the palasa vessel and are banded 
over by the anointed king to his son with the words ' May my 
son oontinue this my work and this my prowess. ' Then two 
homas are offered ( called n&mavyatisafijanlya ) in which at 
first the son is declared to be the father of his father and then 
secondly the relationship is rightly put." M Vide Ap. XVIII, 
16. 14-15, Kat. XV. 6. 11. Then there is a symbolic maroh 
for the plunder of cows. As in Vajapeya a chariot is made 
ready, four horses are yoked to it, the sacrificer asoends it, takes 
the ohariot in the midst of a group of hundred or more cows 
belonging to his kinsmen collected to the north of the ahavunly a, 

2652. Vide Ait. Br. 33 for the story. S5n. ( XV. 17. 27 ) contains 
( with a very few additions nod slight variations ) the whole of the Ait. 
Br. passage on the story of Sunahdepa.

touches one of them with the string of his bow and says ' I 
seize these. ' Then he restores to the owner as many cows as 
are collected or more and returns to the sacrificial ground and 
makes four offerings called Rathavimocanlya. Vide Kat. XV. 
6. 13-23. La^. ( IX. 1. 14-23 ) gives a more graphio acoount 
that at the time of giving gifts, the king's kinsmen are collected 
with their wealth, arrows are discharged at them by the 
sacrificer, they themselves bring baok the arrows and declare 
' O king, may you be victorious. * One-third of their wealth is 
distributed among the priests, one-third is given at the time of 
the Dasapeya to the worthy brahmanas brought in that rite, 
one-third is returned to the kinsmen, villages are bestowed on 
them and they become rajanyas ( king's nobles ) but not worthy 
of coronation. Before getting down from the chariot he puts 
on boar-skin shoes, bows to the earth with ' O mother earth! 
do not injure me nor may I injure thee ' ( Vaj. S. X. 23, Tai. S. 
I. 8. 15. 1 ). The king then sits on a ohair or throne made of 
khadira that is placed in front of the agnldhrlya shed ( Ap. 
XVIII. 18. 5-8, Kat. XV. 7. 1-4 ). The priests and the 'ratnins ' 
take seats round him ; the brahma priest ( the purohita or 
adhvaryu according to Kat. XV. 7. 11 ) hands over the sphya to 
the king, from whom it passes on to several persons viz. the 
king's brother, snta, sthapati, village headman, kinsman ( Ap. 
XVIII. 18. 14-16 ). According to Kat. ( XV. 7. 13 ) the kinsmen 
and the pratiprasthatr mark out a place for dice play with the 
sphya ( according to Ap. XVIII. 18. 16 the superintendent of 
gambling does so). On the ground so marked a quadrangular 
hut or shed is erected. Five dice are handed over to the king 
who is lightly struok by the priests with sticks of sacrificial 
trees. The king calls as umpires ( upadraafr ) the sarhgrahltr, 
the bhagadugha ( collector of taxes ) and the ksattr ( Ap. XVIII. 
19. 6-8 ). The play is so arranged that the best throw ( of the 
dice) comes to the king and the worst to his kinsman. 8 *" It 
appears that the dice play required golden pieces also beyond 
a hundred or a thousand in number ( Ap. XVIII. 19. 1). 
According to Eat. ( XV. 7. 25-26 ) the king actually undergoes 
the avabhrtha bath, while Latyayana as stated above differs.

and barley and baked on twelve potsherds is offered to Indra 
and Visnu. For ten days after the Abhiseoanlya he offers 
successively on each day offerings called ' samsrp&m havlmsi ' 
respectively to Savitr, SarasvatI, Tvastr, Pusan, Indra, Brhas- 
pati, Varuna, Agni, Soma, Visnu ( Kat. XV. 8. 1-4, Ap. XVIII. 
20. 7 whioh says they are ten or seven and they begin with 
Agni ; Asv. IX. 4. 6 speaks of only seven ). Each of these is 
offered in fire set up in a devayajana to the east of the prece- 
ding one and the last of the ten is offered in the shed prepared 
for the Dasapeya rite ( Ap. XVIII. 20. 8-10, Kat. XV. 8. 2-3 ). 
On eaoh of the ten ( or seven ) istis ( of sarhsrpSm havlmsi ) he 
offers to the priests ordinary or golden lotus flowers and on the 
tenth day he wears a garland made of those flowers. That 
becomes his consecration (dlksa) for the next rite, viz. Dasapeya. 
Jaimini declares (in XI. 2. 57-62) that though soma is purchas- 
ed for both Abhiseoanlya and Dasapeya at the same time ( vide 
p. 1216 above), yet in the two ekahas the whole prooedure of soma 
sacrifices is repeated. A different proposition is stated in Kat. 
XV. 8. 10-13 ( except as to dlksa and avabhrtha which are 
repeated in both rites). On the tenth day after the Abhiseoanlya 
is finished the DaSapeya is performed (La^. IX. 2. 1, Kat. XV. 8. 
14 says on the 7th day i. e. on 7th of the bright half of Caitra ). 
This rite is so called because in it each of the ten camasas 
( cups ) of Boma are partaken of by ten brahmanas ( Asv. IX. 3, 
18, Ap. XVIII. 21. 3 ). The brahmanas are the ten rtviks who 
ordinarily partake of the soma in camasas plus 90 more ( called 
anuprasarpakas ) who poseess special qualifications, viz. whose 
ten anoestors on the father's and mother's sides were masters 
of Vedio lore, had rigorously performed their duties and were 
engaged in holy aotions and who had no sexual or marital 
alliances with non-brahmanas"" ( vide Asv. IX. 3. 19-21, San. 

2666. Vide note 574 for tho passage of AaV. According to Ap. 
XVIII. 21. 3-4 and Kat. XV. 8. 16 the ten ancestors on the father's side 
only should have been drinkers of Soma. Vide Lat. IX. 2. 5-7. The

Baghu Vira, was puzzled by this sfltra. It means (when corrected as 
shown ) that the priests and others who came to drink soma and conld 
not trace ten generations of soma-drinkers entered after reciting a 
verse out of the verses that begin with the words ' pibB somam ' ( like 
%. VI. 17. 1 or VII. 22. 1 ) and the verse ' why do yon ask the brl- 
hmana about his father or mother ' ( Ktyhaka Sam. 30. 1 or MaitrS- 
yaul 8. IV. 8. 1 ). The verse is: f* wnmrw far* fSrg I*wt *m*. •

XV. 14. 8-11 ). Kat. XV. 8. 17 gives an option that one need 
not investigate whether the ten ancestors of each were soma- 
drinkers, hut the one hundred brahmanas should enter the sadcu 
after reciting Vaj. 8. X. 30. 

Fees are prescribed at many of the constituent rites in 
B&jasuya, but special fees are mentioned in connection with 
the Abhiseoanlya and Dasapeya (Asv. IX. 4. 2 ff ). At the 
Abhisecanlya Asv. recommends 32000 cows to each of the four 
principal priests, 16000 to each of the first assistants of the 
four, 8000 to each of the next four, 4000 to eaoh of the last 
group of four ( Asv. IX. 4. 3-5 ). These come to the huge figure 
of 240000 cows. Vide San. XV. 16. 16-19 also for suoh large 
figures. At the Dasapeya 1000 cows are the fee and then there 
are special rewards for the 16 priests ( Asv. IX. 4. 7-20, Ap. 
XVIII. 21. 6-7, Kat. XV. 8. 23-27, Lat. IX. 2. 9-15 ) viz. a 
golden chain, a horse, a milch cow ( with calf ), a goat, two 
golden ear-rings, two silver ear-rings, twelve five year old 
pregnant cows, a barren cow, a round golden ornament (rukma), 
a bull, cotton cloth, a thick hempen piece of cloth, a cart full 
of barley drawn by an ox, an ox, a heifer, a young three year 
old bull respectively to udgatr, his three assistants, adhvaryu, 
pratiprasthatr, brahma, maitravaruna, hotr, brahmanacohamsin, 
potr, nesfo acchavaka, agnldhra, unnetr and grftvastut. 

For one year after the avabhrtha bath in Dasapeya, the 
king has to keep certain observances ( called devavratas in Lat. 
IX. 2. 17 ff ) viz. he should not plunge in water for daily bath 
but should only rub his body with water, should always brush 
his teeth, pare his nails, should not cut his hair ( but may shave 
the mustache or beard ), should sleep in the sacrificial fire-shed 
on a tiger-skin with its hair upwards, should daily offer f uel- 
sticks ; his subjects ( except brahmanas ) should not out their 
hair for a year, nor should horses' hair be cut for a year. For 
a year he should never walk on the ground unless he wears 
shoes ( Eat. XV. 8. 29 ). 

There are several minor offerings, suoh as those called 
paficabila in four quarters and in the midst ( Kat. XV. 9. 1-3 ), 
twelve prayuj offerings at the interval of a month or on two 
days ( Kat. XV. 9. 11-14, Ap. XVIII. 22. 5-7 ). 

At the end of a year from the Dasapeya took place the rite 
called Kesavapanlya** 57 which followed the procedure of the

Atiratra saorifice (A6v. IX. 3. 24 ) and in which hair grown for 
a year were cut off. About the exact time of the rite then 
were different views. The com. on Adv. says it was performed 
on some day in the bright half of Vaisakha, while the com. on 
Eat. XV. 9. 20 says that the pressing day of Eesavapanlya fell 
on the Full moon day of Jyes^ha. Vide also Lat. IX. 3. 1-3. 
Then follow two rites called Vyustf-dvir&tra ( dviratra for 
prosperity ), which were respectively ( first ) an Agnistoma and 
( the 2nd ) an Atiratra performed at the interval of one month 
( Kat. XV. 9. 21-23, Asv. IX. 3. 25-26 ). There were several 
views about the time of their performance ( Lat. IX. 3. 5-9, Ap. 
XVIII. 22. 14-16 ). Then one month after the 2nd Vyustfdvi- 
ratra ( i. e. on Sravana Full Moon day ) was performed the rite 
called Esatradbrti (lit. stability of martial power) whioh 
followed the prooedure of Agnistoma (Asv. IX. 3. 27, Lat. IX. 3. 
13 ). San. ( XV. 16. 10-11 ) refers to the legend that Eurus lost 
in each battle because they did not offer the Esatra-dhrti rite."" 
According to Sat. Br. V. 5. 5. 6-9 in place of the UdavasanlyS 
there was the Traidhatavl isti in which a cake prepared of 
barley and rice mixed together was offered. This finished the 
Rajasuya, but one month after it in the bright half the Sautrft- 
manl isti was performed. This last is dealt with separately 
below. 

It will have been seen that this complex rite is full of 
symbolic elements and also popular elements like dice-play. 

In the sabhaparva of the Mahabharata ( chap. 33-35 ) there 
is a description of the Rajasuya performed by Yudhisthira, but 
it is of the vaguest sort and does not go into any details. 
Vide Jai. IV. 4. 1-4 ( the dice-play has no independent fruit 
and that it, though held for the oow referred to in Ap. 
XVIII. 19. 2, is not an anga of the abhisecanlya only, but really 
of the whole Rajasuya ), V. 2. 13-15 ( in the offerings called 
Devasuhavlmsi, whioh are prepared from several kinds of oorn, 
the mortar is one for pounding all the corns one after another ),

CHAPTER XXXV 

SAUTRAMANI" 60 AND OTHER SACRIFICES 

This rite is included among the seven forms of havir- 
yajfias (Gaut. VIII. 20, L&f. V. 4. 23). It is not a soma sacrifice 
but is a combination of an istf with animal sacrifice ( Sat. Br. 
XII, 7. 2. 10 ). The chief characteristic of it is the offering of 
aurU ( wine ) in it. In modern times milk is offered in place 
of sura in the Sautr&manl. Aocording to L&\. V. 4. 20 and Ap. 
XIX. 5. 1 there are two kinds of this rite, viz. Kaukill and 
Caraka-sautramanI ( or the ordinary one ). Eaukill is an 
independent rite, while the ordinary SautrSmanl is performed 
at the end of the Rajasaya ( one month after it ) and also at 
the end of the piling of the fire-altar ( agnioayana ). La^. V. 
4. 21 states that there is ohanting of samans only in the Kaukill 
and not in the other variety and aooording to Kat;. XIX. 5. 1 
( oom. ) it is the brahmS that chants the SSman to Indra in the 
BrhatI tune ( viz. Vaj. S. XX. 30 ) Ap. XIX 1. 2. states that 
in the ordinary sautrSmanl the procedure is that of the nirudha- 
pasubandha and that ( XIX. 5. 2 ) in Eaukill also the same 
prooedure applies. There are two fires as in Varunapraghasa, 
but the southern one is not established on a vedi ( Kat. XIX. 2. 1 
and V. 4. 12 ). Some held ( as is done by Sat. Br. XII. 7. 3. 7 ) 
there were two vedis behind whioh two mounds were raised, one 
for oups of milk and the other for cups of sura. The rite, takes 
four days, during the first three out of which wine is prepared 
from various ingredients, while on the last day three cups of 
milk and three of sura are offered to Asvins, SarasvatI and 
Indra and animals are slaughtered for the same three. 

In this rite the victims are a reddish-white goat for the 
Asvins, an ewe for SarasvatI, and a bull for Indra SutrSman 
(San. XV. 15. 1-4, Asv. III. 9. 2 ). A brief description of the 
method in whioh wine was prepared in the SautrSmanl is given 
below from the Sat. Br. V. 5. 4, XII. 7. 2, Kat. XV.' 9. 28-30, 

2660. The word SautrSmanl is derived from sutraman ( a good 
protector ), an epithet of Indra ( vide 9g. X. 131. 6-7 ). Sat. Br. 
V. 5. 4. 12 derives it as • one who was well saved ( by the Asvins ) ».

XIX. 1-2 ( and com. thereon ). Rice-grains"" ( or malted rioe 
grains and malted barley or syamaka) germinated and un- 
germlnated covered in linen oloth are purchased from an 
eunuch in exchange for lead, wool and fried grain for 
thread. This purchase takes plaoe on the southern one of 
the vedis specially prepared for this rite near the peg 
called antahpfttya on a hide. The rioe grains are cooked in 
plenty of water and the malted barley grains are powdered and 
boiled. The water and scum are strained through woollen oloth. 
The hair of the lion, the wolf and the tiger are thrown into the 
mixture ( this is symbolio of the characteristics of prowess, 
impetuosity and fury found in those wild beasts ). Certain 
vegetable substances such as myrobalans, ginger, nutmeg 
( which serve as yeast and are mentioned in the note below ), 
are powdered and boiled in plenty of water. The hot watery 
scum from the two pots of boiled rice and powdered barley is 
taken into two vessels and the extract of vegetables is poured 
in both of them, the mixture being called mcLaara. The boiled 
rice and barley are also mixed with the extract of powdered 
vegetables, put in a kumbhl ( a big jar ) along with contents of 
the masara vessels and the jar is plaoed in a pit dug to the 
south-west of the sacrificial hall and kept there for three nights. 
On the first day the milk of one cow meant for Asvins 
is poured into the kumbbl plaoed in the pit and powder 
of saspa is added. The next day the milk of two cows meant 
for Sarasvatl is poured into the kumbhl and powder of tokma 
is added. On the third milk of three cows meant for Indra is 
added and also the powder of fried rice grains ( lftja ). To the 
west of the mound prepared on the southern vedi a pit is dug 
( outside the vedi according to com. on Est. XIX 2. 7. ) on 
which is spread bull's hide over which a sieve of bamboo is 
held and the liquid from the large jar is poured over the sieve 
( called karotara ). ,,,B The wine thus purified is collected in a 

2661. Eat. (XIX. 1. 18 ff) uses the words srsti (malted rioe or grass), 
jfrw ( malted barley ), »nrj ( vegetable substances ). The com. on Est.

eata ( a vessel of palSsa wood ) and it is further purified by 
means of the hair of the tail of a cow and a horse. Of this 
purified wine the pratiprasthatr fills the cups for being offered 
to the three deities, viz. the Asvins, SarasratI and Indra. Either 
one or three cups are filled for eaoh of the three deities ( Eftt- 
XV. 10. 13 ). This is done after the offering of the omentum 
and after mftrjana. According to Ap. XIX. 2. 9-11 and Kat 
XV. 10. 12 powders of kuvala, karkandhu and badara fruits are 
added to the wine in the cups and they are offered in the 
daksina fire ( Kat. XV. 10. 17 ). There was only one puronu- 
vakya, one praisa and one y&jyft for all cups. 8 " 8 On the 
daksina fire a vessel having a hundred holes covered with a 
hair strainer and gold and containing the remnants of the 
wine cups was hung by means of a iikya and the trickling 
drops of wine were offered to pifcrs called Somavat, Barhisad 
and Agnisvatta with Vfij. S. XIX. 52-60. It is to be noted that 
the remnants of the wine were not drunk by the priests, but 
were either drunk by a brahmana hired for the purpose ( Ap. 
XIX. 3. 3) or they were poured over an ant-hill. ASv.(III.9.5-6) 
says that the priests muttered a verse ( which is Vaj. S. XIX. 
35 ) and only smelt the remnants of the wine offered ( this is 
called pranabhaksa ). San. notes that some teachers reoited 
the puronuvakya, yajya and praisa in an entirely changed 
form ( probably as directly mentioning only sura and not in 
the phraseology of soma ) but it should not be so done, since 
that is a method fit only for asuras. From this one may plausibly 
argue that the SautramanI was practised among Asuras ( non- 
Aryan people or sohismatics ) and was adopted by the Vedic 
Aryans, with appropriate changes. But it is clear that the 
drinking of sura by priests was condemned even then. 8 "* Eggel-

ing ( in S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 246 n ) does not appear to be right so 
far at least as the sutra literature goes when he says that the 
priests drank the remnants of the wine cups ( though the Sat. 
Br. uses the somewhat doubtful word ' bhaksayanti ' which 
in the sutras also means ' smelling ' ). 

All three animals in the sautramanl may be goats. A fourth 
animal was offered to Brhaspati under certain circumstances 
( Ap. XIX. 2. 1-2 ). Though the omentum of the victims was 
offered to Asvins, SarasvatI and Indra, the pasupurodasas were 
offered to Indra, Savitr and Varuna ( Asv. III. 9. 2 ). This rite 
was performed at the end of Rajasuya or for one who performs 
cayana or for one who suffers from purging due to excessive 
drinking of soma beverage or who vomits soma or from the 
openings of whose body ( except the mouth ) soma flows out. 
The independent ( kaukill ) sautramanl was performed for a 
brahmaaa who desired prosperity, or for a king who was driven 
from his kingdom or for one who had no oattle ( Eat. XIX. 1. 
2-4). In the beginning and at the end there was a cam to Vditi. 

The northern vedi is in extent only one-third of the vedi 
for a soma saorifice. When the uttaravedi is being prepared 
the pratiprasthatr takes earth from the catvala pit, makes a 
mound to the south of the uttaravedi, a second mound for 
keeping wine cups in front of the daksina fire, brings fire from 
the daksina fire and establishes it on the mound which is to 
the south of the uttaravedi According to Eat. XIX. 2. 11 
(which is part of the description of the independent sautramanl) 
the adhvaryu purifies on the northern ved-i milk oontained in 
a vessel made of reeds ( vetasa ) and fills oups of milk, the one 
for Asvins being made of asvattha wood, and those for 
SarasvatI and Indra being made of udumbara and nyagrodha. 
The three cups of milk are offered together by the adhvaryu. 
After the offering to Vanaspati in the animal sacrifice a oouch 
of muSja cords is placed between the two vedis and the sacri. 
fleer sits on the couch which is covered with a black antelope 
skin with a silver piece under his left foot and a golden one 
under his right foot. The adhvaryu offers thirty-two oups of 
vasa ( fat ) from vessels made of the hoofs of bulls with Vaj. 
S. XIX 80-95. The remnants of fat are oontained in a sata 
( vessel ) of reeds. The adhvaryu sprinkles over the yajamana 
whose body has been rendered fragrant with unguents the 
liquid from that vessel till it triokles down up to his mouth. 
The adhvaryu touches, the sacrificer who summons his men

and servants calling them by auspioious names (such as 
susloka ). The men lift him gradually first up to the knee, 
then up to the navel &o. The saorificer alights on a blaok 
antelope skin when a 33rd cup of fat is taken., a saman in the 
Brhat tune for Indra (Vaj S. XX 30) is ohanted by the brahma 
priest and the nidhana (finale) of it differs according to the 
varna of the sacrifioer MMa and is sung in chorus by all and 
then the 33rd oup is offered. There is the final purificatory 
bath as in Somayaga. Finally, after the oaru to Aditi Smiksa 
is offered to Mitra and Varuna and then an animal to Indra 
Vayodhas. Jaimini lays down certain propositions about the 
Sautramanl. In III. 5. 14-15 he states that all the contents of 
the grahas of milk are offered in the fire on the northern vedi 
and of the wine cups into the southern fire and nothing is left 
out of them for being offered as Svist&krt offering or for the 
purpose of ida. In IV. 3. 29-31 it is established that when the 
Vedic text says 'after piling the fire altar one should perform 
Sautramanl ' there is no injunction about the time of performing 
Sautramanl but what is declared is that the Sautramanl is an 
ahga (a subordinate constituent) of the principal rite viz. 
agnioayana and in IX. 3- 40-41 it is stated with reference to 
the same text that the sautramanl is not necessarily performed 
immediately after agnioayana but on the Full Moon day or 
New Moon day thereafter. In VIII. 2. 1-9 Jaimini declares 
that though the sura offered in Sautramanl is spoken of as soma 
and though several actions such as purchase of sura, tying 
in cloth are common to sura and soma, the general procedure 
to be followed in Sautramanl is that of darsapurnamasa and 
not of soma sacrifice and that sura is spoken of as soma by 
way of lauding the offering of wine cups. 8 "'

This is one of the most ancient sacrifices. 9g- 1. 162 and 163

body of the horse to lie down upon ( 1. 162. 16 ). Horse's flesh 
was cooked in a pot called ukha ( 1. 162. 13 ) and offered in fire 
(1.162.19); 34 ribs are mentioned in Rg. I. 162. 18, while 
26 ribs are mentioned in other tezts'with reference to the goat. 
It appears that aguh, yajya and vasa^kara were uttered in 
making offerings of the horse's flesh ( Rg. I. 162. 15 ). The 
horse is identified with Aditya, Trita and Yama ( Rg. 1. 163. 3 ). 

This rite is desoribed in the Sat. Br. XIII. 1-5, Tai. Br. 
III. 8-9, in which several ancient monarohs are [enumerated 
who performed the Asvamedha. The Tai. Br. III. 8. 9 identi- 
fies the Asvamedha with the kingdom MM and states 'he, who 
being weak, offers an Asvamedha, is indeed thrown away ( lit. 
spilt away ). If the enemies ( of the king ) ware to secure the 
horse, the sacrifice would be destroyed '. The sutras closely 
follow the Brahmanas. The Asvamedha is deemed in the 
sutras to be an ahinq of three pressing days ( Asv. X. 8. 1, com. 
on Kafc. XX. 1. 1., San. XVI. 1. 2 ). A paramount sovereign 
( sftrvabhauma ) or a crowned king who is not a sarva- 
bhauma may perform this sacrifice ( Ap. XX. 1. 1, Lat. 
IX 10. 17 ). Asv. X 6. 1 states ( probably following the Ait. 
Br. about the Mahabhiseka in Rajasuya ) that one who desires 
to secure all objects, to win all victories ( inoluding one over 
his own senses) and to attain all prosperity may perform 
Asvamedha. tm A beginning is made on the 8th or 9th of the 
bright half of Phalguna or on the same days of Jyestha or

AsSdha according to some ( Kat. XX. 1. 2-3, Lat IX. 9. 6-7 ). 
Ap. holds that it should be begun on the Full Moon of Oaitra 
( XX 1. 4 ). Rice from four vessels, four afijalia and four 
handfuls is cooked (it is called brahmaudana); it is smeared 
with ghee and given to the four principal priests who are also 
given one thousand cows each and gold weighing one hundred 
berries ( Kat. XX. 1. 4-6, La}. IX 9. 8 ). Two istfs are per- 
formed, the first for Agni Murdhanvan and the 2nd for Pusan 
( Asv. X. 6. 2-5, Kat. XX. 1. 25 ). The yajamana cuts off his 
hair, pares his nails, brushes the teeth, bathes, puts on new 
garments, wears a golden ornament ( niska ), observes silence. 
Vide Tai. Br. III. 8. 1 and Ap. XX 4. 9-14 for these. His four 
queens well-decked and wearing niskas oome near the king, the 
crowned queen aocompanied by princesses, the 2nd queen 
( vavata, the favourite one ) accompanied by daughters of ksa- 
triyas, the third ( parivrkti, the disoarded one ) aocompanied by 
daughters of sutas and village headmen and the fourth ( pal&- 
gall, of low origin ) aocompanied by daughters of ksattrs 
( chamberlains ) and samgrahltrs. M ' 8 The yajamana enters the 
fire-hall and sits to the west of the garhapatya fasing the 
north. 

Various rules are stated about the horse's colour and other 
qualities ( Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 2. 4, Kat. XX 1. 29-35, LH IX. 9. 4 ). 
The horse must be all white with dark circular spots and 
of great speed, or the front part of its body may be dark and 
the rest of the body white, or it may have a tuft of dark blue 
hair. The horse is sprinkled with holy water by the four 
principal priests standing in the four directions (from the east ), 
each surrounded respectively by a hundred prinoes, a hundred 
ugras who are not kings, by sutas and village headmen, and 
by chamberlains and samgrahltrs ( Ap. XX. 4, Sat. XIV. 1. 31 ). 
A dog with four eyes ( i. e. having two natural eyes and two 
depressions in the skin above the eyes ) is killed by a man 
of the ayogava caste or by a voluptuary with the pestle of 
sidhraka wood. The horse is made to enter water and the 
corpse of the dog is with a loop of reeds made to float under 
the horse (Ap. XX 3. 6-13, Kat. XXI. 38 ff„ Sat. XIV. 1. 30-34). 
The horse is brought near the fire and offerings are made 
in the fire till the water ceases to drip down from the horse's 
body ( Kat XX. 2. 3-5 ). A girdle made of mumja grass or of

darbbas 12 or 13 aratnis long and smeared with tbe ajya tbat 
remains after being poured over the brahmaudana is invoked 
with the mantra 'imam — agrbhnan rasanam rtasya' (Tat 
S. IV. I. 2. 1, Vaj. S. 22. 2 ) and the horse is bound with it after 
taking the permission of the brahmS priest. The borse, having 
water sprinkled over it with mantras and after the saorifioer 
repeats into its right ear the several appellations for a horse 
( Ap. XX. 5. 1-9 ), is let off to roam over the country accom- 
panied by four hundred guards with the mantra ' O gods, the 
guardians of quarters, proteot this horse &o.' ( Vaj. S. XXII. 19, 
Tai. S. VII. 1. 12. 1 ). The guards include one hundred princes 
deserving to be seated on couohes in the presence of the king, 
wearing armour and the other guards are armed with swords, 
arrows and thiok clubs aocording to their rank ( Tai. Br. III. 
8. 9, Ap. XX. 5. 10-14, Kat. XX. 2. 11 ), The horse is allowed 
to roam for a year where it likes and is not made to turn 
back, but it is prevented from associating with mares or 
plunging into water for a bath ( Kat. XX 2. 12-13 ). While 
doing their duty of guarding the horse, the guards are to subsist 
by demanding food from brahmanas who do not know the 
prooedure of Atvamedha ( or depriving them of it ) or on cooked 
food taken from all brahmanas ; they may stay in the houses 
of chariot-makers ( Ap. XX. 5. 15-18, Kat. XX. 2. 15-16 ). 
Every day during the year that the horse is absent, three istis 
are offered to Savitr in the morning, mid-day and evening, 
when Savitr is respectively addressed as Satyaprasava, Prasa- 
vitr and Asavit?: ( Asv. X. 6. 8, La}. IX. 9. 10, Kftt. XX. 2. 6). 
When the prayaja offerings are made a brahmana ( other than 
the priests) with a vln5 chants three laudatory gathas in 
honour of the king composed by himself stating ' you donated 
this, you performed such and such a sacrifice, you cooked food 
for distribution ' ( Ap. XX. 6. 5, Kat. XX 2. 7 ). This singing 
took place thrice a day after the istf to Savitr ( Sat. Br. XIII. 
4. 2. 8-14, Tai. Br. III. 9. 14 ). A ksatriya lute player also sang 
three laudatory songs ( Sat. Br. XIII. 1. 5. 6, Ap. XX. 6. 14 ) 
referring to the battles fought and victories won by the saori- 
ficer. Every day for a year after the is^i to Savitr is finished 
the hotr Bitting on a golden cushion to the south of the 
ahavanlya fire recites to the crowned king surrounded by his 
sons and ministers the narratives called ' PSriplava ' ( revolving 
or recurring legends ). When about to oommenoe the Pariplava 
the hotr makes the summons ' adhvaryoS ' and the adhvaryu 
seated on a golden seat (with four legs) responds with 'ho

hotar ' ( Asv. X. 6. 10-13 ). m * The other priests also sit down on 
cushions or boards and bands of singers holding lutes Bit down 
to the south and sing of the good deeds of the king along with 
those of his ancestors ( Ap. XX. 6. 13 ). As the king is thus 
engaged In sacrifices and in listening to the Pariplava ,,w and to 
the songs, Ap. ( XX. 3. 1-2 ) notes that, till the Asvamedha is 
performed, the adhvaryu becomes the king, as the sacrificer 
( the orowned king ) declares ' O brahmanas and nobles 1 this 
adhvaryu is your king. Whatever honour you ( usually pay 
to me ) should be paid to him. May whatever he does be 
regarded as done by you. ' As v. ( X 7 ; 1-10 ) sets out what the 
Pariplava is. Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 3 and San. XVI. 2 also deal at 
length with the Pariplava and they agree with Asv. in most 
plaoes. For ten days one after another different texts are 
recited and this goes on for a year in narrative cycles of ten 
days. On the first day the hotr says ' Manu was the son of 
Vivasvat, men are his subjects ' and points at the house-holders 
sitting down in the sacrifioial hall with ' they ( men as subjects 
of Manu ) are here Bitting down * and then recites some one 
hymn of the Rgveda saying ' to-day the Veda is that of rks. ' 
On the second day he says ' Yama is the son of Vivasvat, the 
pltrs are his subjects ' and points to the old men assembled and 
recites one anuv&ka from the Tajurveda. On the 3rd day 
Varuna and the gandharvas ( as his subjects identified with fine 
looking young men ) are mentioned and some hymn from the 
Atharva-veda dealing with diseases and their cure was narrated. 
On the 4th day the narration relates to Soma, son of Visnu and 
Apsarases ( identified with beautiful young women ), and some 

2669. Various methods of response ( qfttit ) are mentioned by £.p. 
and others. ' gnft % « »;«rql3fCTr«*jf fferr *t**v$ i »S3rv g taft«vw& *Gt-

5th the narration relates to Arbuda Eadraveya and serpents 
(identified with visitors who know serpent lore and poison lore); 
on the 6th day to Eubera Vaisravana, his subjects the Raksases 
(identified with evil doing selagas and the lore of Pisaca Veda (?). 
On the 7th the narration relates to Asita Dhanvana, his subjects 
the Asuras and usurers and some illusion ( a trick ) from Asura 
lore, on the 8th day to Matsya Ssmada, his subjects aquatio 
animals, Pufijisthas ( fishermen ) from Matsya oountry and 
some Pur&na passage from the Pur&na-veda, on the 9th to 
T&rksya, son of Vipascit, his subjects the birds and brahma- 
oarins and some narrative ( itihasa ) from the itihasaveda ; on 
the 10th day Dharma Indra, his subjects the gods and the 
young srotriyas who accept no gifts, and some saman from the 
Samaveda. Every day for a year in the evening four oblations 
called Dhrti were made in the ahavanlya ( Eat. XX. 3. 4). On 
the first day 49 homas called Prakramas were made in the 
daksina fire with Vaj. S. XXII. 7-8 (beginning with 'himkaraya 
■vaha • ). Vide Sat. Br. XIII. 1. 3. 5, Tai. S. VII. 1. 19. In this 
way the Savitrl istfs, singing, listening to Pariplava and Dhrti 
offerings went on for a year. For a year the sacrifioer kept 
observances as in the Rfijasuya ( hS.\. IX 9. 14 ). Large fees 
were given to the hotr and adhvaryu (La^. IX 9. 12-13 and 16) 
and to the singers (Eat. XX. 3. 7 ). 

Several expiatory oeremonies are prescribed ( Ap. 
XXII. 7. 9-20, Eat. XX. 3. 13-21 ) if the horse died or suffered 
from disease. If the horse was carried away by an enemy the 
saorifice was destroyed. At the end of the year the horse was 
brought to a stable and the sacrificer underwent dlksS ( initia- 
tion ). There were 12 dlksas, 12 up&sads and three sutya days 
( days on which soma was pressed ). Vide Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 4. 1, 
Asv. X. 8. 1, Lat IX 9. 17. After the dlksa the sacrifioer is sung as 
on a par with the gods and on the pressing days, at the time of 
avabhrtha, the udayanlya isti, the anubandhya and the udava- 
sanlyS he is spoken of as on a par with Praj&pati. mi There are 
21 yflpas ( stakes ) all being 21 aratnis high. The central one 
is of Rajjudala ( slesmataka ) tree. On its two sides are two 
pine yupas and on both sides thereafter there are three yupaB

each of bilva, khadira and palaia ( Tai. Br. III. 8. 9, Sat. Br. 
XIII. 4. 4. 5, Ap. XX. 9. 6-8, Eat. XX. 4. 16-20). Large numbers 
of animals are tied at all these stakes and slaughtered. Even 
wild animals like boars and birds are bound and held between 
the intervals of the yupas ( Ap. XX, 14. 2 S. ). Vide Vaj. S. 
XXIV for a list of hundreds of animals out of which those 
from Eapinjala onwards (Vaj. S. XXIV. 20 ff. ) are let off 
after fire is carried round them (Eat. XX. 6. 9, Ap. XX. 17. 5 ). 
The 2nd among the three pressing days is the most important 
and is full of several very striking matters ( such as the ribald 
dialogue, the brahmodya &o. ). The horse to be sacrificed is 
yoked to a chariot along with three horses, the adhvaryu and 
saorifioer occupy the ohariot and take it to a lake or reservoir 
of water, make the horses enter it (Eat. XX. 5. 11-14 ). On the 
horse's return to the saorificial ground it is anointed with 
clarified butter by the crowned queen, the favourite queen 
and the discarded queen in the front, the middle and hind parts 
of its body respectively. They also respectively tie 101 golden 
beads on the head, mane and tail of the horse with bhuh, 
bhuvah and svah. They give the remnants of the previous 
night's offering to the horse with Vaj. S. XXIII. 8. If it does 
not eat it the remnants are cast into water. Near the yupa a 
dialogue takes place between the hotr who asks ' who wanders 
alone ' ( Vaj. S. XXIII. 9 ) and ' who was the first to be thought 
of ' ( Vftj. S. XXIII. 11 ) and the brahma replies with Vaj. S. 
XXIII. 10 and 12 respectively. The horse is praised by repeating 
Bg. I. 163 (Asv. X. 8. 5). A piece of oloth is spread over grass, 
thereon a mantle is spread and a gold pieoe is placed thereon 
and the horse is killed thereon. Before the words ' adhrigo 
samldhvam' in the adhrigu praisa Rg. L 162 and Rg. 
1. 163. 12-13 are to be recited. When the horse is killed, the 
wives of the king go round it thrice from left to right with 
' gananam tva ', thrice from right to left with ' priyanam tva ' 
and again thrioe from left with ' nidhlnam tva ' ( all in Vaj. S. 
XXIII. 19 ). They fan the dead horse with their garments 
while braiding their hair on the right side upwards loosening 
the hair on the left side and strike their left thighs with their 
right hands ( Ap. XXII. 17. 13, Asv. X 8. 8). The crowned 
queen lies down by the side of the dead horse and both are 
oovered by the adhvaryu with the mantle on whioh the horse 
lies and she unites with it (Ap. XXII. 18. 3-4, Eat. 
XX. 6. 15-16 ). Then acoording to Asv. X. 8. 10-13 outside the 
vedi the hotr abuses the crowned queen in obscene language and 



Oh. XXXV ] Atvamedha 1235 

she returns the abuse along with her one hundred attendant 
princesses and the brahma priest and the favourite wife enter 
into a similar .obscene abuse. According to Eat. XX. 6. 18 the 
four principal priests and the chamberlain enter into an obscene 
abusive dialogue (given in Vaj. S. XXIII. 22-31 ) with the 
queens along with their young female attendants. Vide Sat. 
Br. XIII. 2. 9 and L&% IX. 10. 3-6. The attendant princesses 
raise the crowned queen from near the horse with 'dadhikrivno' 
( $g. IV. 39. 6 = Vaj. 8. XXIII. 32 ). The horse is cut up with 
golden, silver and iron (lauhi may mean copper) needles by 
the crowned queen, the favourite queen and the discarded one 
with Vaj. S. XXIII. 33-38. They take out the fat of the dead 
horse in place of the omentum taken from the goat in other 
sacrifices (Ap. XXII. 18. 10-11, Kat. XX. 7. 7). The blood of the 
horse is cooked and offered at the end of the other offerings to 
svistakrt ( Ap. XXII. 19. 10 and Kat. XX. 8. 8.). Before the 
omentum of the animals meant for PrajSpati is offered there is 
brahmodya ( a theological dialogue, where questions and riddles 
are propounded and answers given ) between the priests in 
the sadas. According to Asv. X 9. 2-3 at first the hotr asks the 
adhvaryu ' who roams alone &o. ' ( Vaj. S. 23. 45 ) and the 
adhvaryu replies ' the sun roams alone &c* ( Vaj. S. 23. 46 ). 
Then the hotr again asks ' what light is like the sun's &c* 
( Vaj. 3. 23. 47 ) and the adhvaryu replies 'truth is light equal 
to the sun &c.' ( Vaj. S. 23. 48, which however reads ' brahma 
suryasamam ' ). Then the brahma priest asks udgatr and he 
replies ( Vaj. S. 23. 49-50 ), then the udgatr asks a question and 
the brahma replies ( Vaj. S. 23. 51-52 ). Then the four priests 
come out and eaoh asks the sacrificer who sits facing the east 
the question ' I ask you the furthest limit of the earth &c.' 
( Rg. 1. 164. 34 ) and the sacrificer replies ' this vedi is the 
furthest limit ' ( Bg. L 164. 35 ). Vide La}. IX. 10. 9-14 for 
almost the same questions and answers.*"' Kat. (XX. 7. 10-15) 
mentions V&j. S. XXIII. 49-62 as the dialogue that takes 
place at this stage in the Asvamedha and states that Rg. I. 
164. 34 ( = Vaj. S, XXIII. 61 ) is the question propounded by 
the saorifioer ( and not by the priests as Asv. says ). Two 
grahas called Mahiman are offered, one before the omentum is 

2678. In several sacrifices such riddles were mooted ; vide Air. 
VIII. 13. 14 for one in DaforStra which is taken from Ait. Br. 24. 6, and 
Sat. Br. IV. 6. 9. 20 ; ride Tai. 8. VII. 4. 18, Tai. Br. III. 9. 6 for brah- 
modya and ?g. X. 88, 18 and VIII. 58. 1-2 for questions and answers. 



1236 History of Dharmaiaatra [ Ch. XXIV 

offered and the other after it ( Sat. Br. XIII. 5. 2. 23 referring 
to Vaj. S. XXIII. 8, Asv. X 9. 4, Eat. XX 7. 16-17 and 27 ). 
Offerings of the vapS of all animals are made to the several 
deities of whom Prajapati is the last. Then the king sits on a 
lion's or tiger's skin, a pieoe of gold is placed on his head with 
Rg. I. 90. 1, a bull- hide is held over his head, he is sprinkled 
with the remnants ( sarhsrSva ) of the offerings called mahiman 
and offerings are made to the twelve months, Madhu, Madhava 
&o. and seasons Vasanta &o. After the several offerings, on 
the third pressing day, the sacrifioer performs the final purifi- 
catory bath. At the end of the avabhrtha isti, on the head of 
a bald man, un whose eye-balls are yellowish-brown, who has 
prominent teeth, who is suffering from white leprosy and who 
dips into water, an offering is made ( three according to 
Ap. XX. 22. 6 ) with the words ' to Jumbaka, svaha * ( Vaj. S. 
XXV. 9). Vide Eat. XX 8. 16, Sail. XVI. 18. 18 and Sat. 
XIV. 5. 4. The latter add two important details, viz. that the 
man should be of the Atri gotra and that he should enter suoh 
deep water that it should flood his mouth. The Tai. Br. III. 
9. 15 says that the ahuti ' to Jumbaka, svaha ' is the last in 
Asvamedha and that Jumbaka means Varuna. A hundred 
cows and a cart to which bulls are yoked are given to him. 
When the sacrifioer comes out of the water after avabhrtha 
persons guilty of such grave sins as biahmana murder plunge 
into thaWater and become purified without having performed 
the penances prescribed for such sins (Kat. XX 8. 17-18)." 74 

Apart from the gifts provided for many of the subordinate 
rites performed in the Asvamedha, Lat. ( IX 10. 15— IX 11. 4 ) 
prescribes that on the first and last of the three soma pressing 
days he should donate a thousand cows and on the seoond day 
he should donate all the wealth that belongs to the non- 
brahmana residents in one district ( janapada ) out of his realm, 



&. irr. III. 9. 15.

words. According to Gaut. 22.9, ip. Dh. 8. 1. 9. 24. 22 and Manu IX. 82-83 
if the murderer of a brBhmana, after declaring his crime, bathed in water 
in which the king took bis final avabhrtha bath, he would be free from 
that »in. Prof. Eggeling ( S.B.B. vol. 44 p. XL. note 1 ) does not advert 
to the fact that expiation for brBhmana murder was thus prescribed by 
the dharmaiatras. 



Ch. XXXV ] Aimmedha 1237 

or he should donate to the hotr the wealth in the eastern part 
of the country conquered by him and the wealth in the 
southern, western and northern parts respectively to the brahmS, 
adhvaryu and udgatr and their assistants or he should at least 
donate 48,000 cows to each of the four principal priests, 24000, 
12000, 6000 to each of the four groups of three assistants of the 
principal priests in order. Asv. X. 10. 10 also says that he 
should donate the wealth of non-brShmanas in the four conquered 
quarters except land and human beings. Est. (XX. 4. 27-28) 
contains similar rules. 

Even in ancient times this sacrifice must have been rare. 
The Tai. S. V. 4. 12. 3 and Sat. Br. XIII. 3. 3. 6 both state that 
the Asvamedha was a saorifice which was utsanna ( gone out 
of vogue). The Atharvaveda (XI. 7. 7-8) also appears to 
regard the Rajasuya, Vajapeya, Asvamedha, the sattras and 
several other sacrifices as utsanna. The origin of the rite is 
obscure. In it several popular, religious and symbolical ele- 
ments are inextricably blended and some rites like the queen 
lying down near the dead horse must be regarded as unaccount- 
able survivals from the hoary past. Various theories have been 
advanced to account for the origin, but there is, as is to be 
expected, no agreement among scholars. Vide S. B. E. vol. 44. 
pp. XVIII-XXXIII, Prof. Keith's Introduction to Tai. S. pp. 
CXXXII ff. and ' Religion and Philosophy of the Veda ' part 2 
pp. 345-347 for the several theories of European soholars. 

In the Asvamedhika parva of the Mahabharata Asvamedha 
is described at some length. It is probable that in the epio 
only the popular elements and a few of the religious rites were 
emphasized. In chap. 71. 16 Vyasa tells Yudhisthira that the 
Asvamedha purifies a person of all sins." 7 ' The dlksa took 
place on the full moon of Caitra ( 72. 4 ). The sphya, kurcas and 
utensils were made of or inlaid with gold ( 72. 9-10.). The 
greatest warrior of the day, Arjuna, was appointed to guard 
the horse during its rambles for a year, and he was asked to 
avoid battle and carnage as far as possible ( 72. 23-24 ). The 
horse was krsnasara ( marked with dark spots, 73. 8 ). Arjuna 
was accompanied by a pupil of Yajfiavalkya and many learned 
brahmanas (73. 18) for the performance of propitiatory rites 
(s&nti). No indication is given as to the number of soldiers

that accompanied Arjuna, The horse is said to have wandered 
over the whole of India from east to south, then west to north. 
After many fights with opponents Arjuna meets death at the 
hands of his son BabhruvShana, king of Manipura, whom he 
upbraided for meek submission, but is brought back to life by 
his wife Ulupl, the Naga princess (chap. 80). Arjuna spares 
the lives of the opponents whom he vanquishes and invites 
them to the sacrifice. The description of the sacrifice follows the 
general outline given above. But there is hardly any detailed 
or graphio description of the special features of Asvamedha and 
one rather carries the impression that the author does not 
depict what he has seen but only what he has heard or read. 
The pravargya ( 88. 21 ) and the pressing of soma are mentioned 
(88. 22). There were six yupas of bilva, 6 of khadira, two of 
devadam and one of slesmataka ( 88. 27-28 ). Bull's heads and 
aquatio animals were built into the fire altar (88. 34). DraupadI 
was made to lie by the dead horse (89. 2-3 ). There are several 
points of difference. The altar is shaped like a Garuda (88. 32), 
the bricks were of gold, and 300 animals were sacrificed. It is 
said that the vapa of the horse was offered ( 89. 3 ), while Ap , 
(XX. 18. 11) emphatically states that there is no vapa in the 
oase of the horse. Great emphasis is laid on the huge masses 
of food distributed to all, on the drinking bouts and singing 
parties and the feeding of the poor and helpless (88. 23, 89. 
39-43 ). Orores of niskas were donated to brahmanas and the 
whole earth to Vyftsa (89. 8-10) who returned it to Yudhisthira 
for gold to be given to him and to brahmanas. The Balakanda 
of Ramayana (chap. 13-14) contains a more graphio descrip- 
tion of the Asvamedha performed by Dasaratha for securing 
sons. It expressly refers to the KalpasQtra ( tryahossvamedhah 
sarhkbyatah kalpasntrena brahmanaih ). 

In I. A. vol. VIII. p. 273 ( at p. 278 ) we find that a general, 
called Udayacandra, of Nandivarma Fallavamalla ( about the 
9th century A. D.) defeated Prthivlvyaghra, king of Nisadha, 
who had accompanied the horse in his horse sacrifice. In E. C. 
vol. X. Kolar No. 63 it is stated in an inscription of 757 A. D, 
that the Calukya emperor Fulakesi was purified by his bath 
at an Asvamedha. In the very ancient Nanaghat Inscription 
( A. 8. W. I. vol. V. pp. 60-61 ) an Andhra king" 7 ' is described as 

2676. In the Bhsgarata-pursna XII. 1. 20 the founder of the 
Andhras is said to have been a vrsala and the Matsya ( 144. 43 ) says 
that BQdra kings will perforin AsVamedha in the Kali age.

Sattra 

It was shown above ( pp. 1213-1214 ) that the Dvadasaha 
sacrifice partook of the characteristics of both ahlna and a sattra 
and a few points of difference between the two were also set out 
there. Sattras are sacrificial sessions, the duration of which 
varies from 12 days to a year or more. Their archetype (prakrti) 
is the Dvadasaha (Asv. XI. 1.7). Sattras again may for conve- 
nience be divided into those called Ratrisattras and those 
called Samvatsarika ( carried on for a year or more ). Asv. 
( XI. 1. 8-XI. 6. 16 ) and Kat. ( XXIV. 1-3 ) speak of numerous 
Ratrisattras called Trayodasaratra and so on up to Sataratra, 
state the principles on which these sattras are evolved from the 
Dvadasaha, the model, and set out the sohemes of all of them. 
If only one day has to be added then it is the Mahavrata that 
is added before the last day called Udayanlya. If two or more 
days are required to be added then they are added before the 
Dasaratra ( that forms the central part of the Dvadasaha and 
comes after the Prayaplya day). In the case of Ratrisattras of 
many days' duration sadahas are added (Kat. XXIV. 1. 5-7, Asv. 
XI. 1. 8-14 ) ; the Dasaratra is never repeated but is only one 
in the same sattra ( Eat. XXIV. 3. 34 ). For want of space all 
the Ratrisattras will be passed over. The GavSm-ayana " 7S 
( lit. the course or way of the cows i. e. the sun's rays or days ) 
is the model of all Samvatsarika sattras ( Asv. XI. 7. 1 and 
com., Jai. VIII, 1. 8, Eat. XXIV. 4. 2 ). Several sattras of the 
duration of one year or more are mentioned in the sutra texts 
such as Adityan&m-ayana ( Asv. XII. 1. 1 ), Angirasam-ayana

Ch. XXXV ] Qavam-ayana iiii 

The Gavam-ayana was performed for various rewards viz. 
progeny, prosperity, plenty (or greatness), high position, heaven 
( Ap. XXI. 15. 1, Sat. XVI. 5. 14 ). About the day on which 
dlksa ( initiation ) for it took place there were several views. 
The Ait. Br. ( 19. 4 ) prescribes that it should be done either 
in Magha or Phalguna. Some ( Sat. XVI. 5. 16-17, Ap. XXI. 
15. 5-6 ) said that dlksa took place four days before the Full 
Moon of Magha or Caitra. Vide Lat. X. 5. 18-19, Kat. XIII. 
1. 2-10 for the several days. Jai. VI. 5. 30-37 and Kat. XIII. 
1. 8 favour the view that the dlksa should be undertaken four 
days before the Full Moon day of Magha ( i. e. on ekadasl day ) 
since the Vedio texts prescribe the Ekastaka day of Magha 
(i. e. 8th of dark half ) for the purpose of soma ( after 12 days 
of dlksa). In the Gavam-ayana the procedure of the Dvadasaha 
as a sattra is to be followed ( Ap. XXI. 15. 2-3, Jai. VIII. 1. 17 ), 
but some held that in Gavam-ayana there were to be 17 dlksas 
( instead of 12 ). There are certain general rules about sattras 
which may be stated here. They are to be performed by many 
as saorificers and only brahmanas can perform them ( Jai. VI. 
6. 16-23, Kat. I. 6. 14 ). There are no separate priests (rtvij ), 
but the yajamanas themselves are the priests ( Jai. X. 6. 45-50 
and 51-59, Sat. XVI. 1. 21 ). A text quoted by Sahara on 
Jai. VI. 2. 1 says that the persons who engage together in a sattra 
must be at least 17 and not more than 24 and eaoh of the 
performers secures the same unseen ( or spiritual ) reward for 
which the sattra is performed (Jai. VI. 2. 1-2). There is 
therefore no varaija (choosing) of priests and there is no 
question of remunerating them for their services by several 
gifts as in Jyotistoma ( Jai. X 2. 34-38 ). At the time when 
gifts are made in other rites, in sattras the saorificers perform 
the Daksina homas and waving their dark antelope skins they 
go out with their faces turned northwards by the path by which 
daksinas are taken away in other rites ( Sat. XVL 2. 19,. 
Kat. XII. 2. 18 ). As no daksinas are to be donated in sattras 
agents ( called sanlharas ) are not to be sent for collecting 
subscriptions ( Sat. XVI. 1. 40 ). The sacrificial utensils 
( yajfiapatras like juhu ) to be used in the sattra are specially 
got prepared for the common use of all, while eaoh keeps his 
own utensils separate with which he is oremated if he dies in 
the midst of the performance ( Jai. VI. 6. 33-35 ). Though the 
general rule is that there is no pratinidhi ( substitute ) for the 
performer of rites like agnihotra, the sattra is art exception, 
since if any one of the many performers dies in the midst of a 
h, d. 150 



i242 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XXXV 

sattra another person may be substituted by the others in his 
place ( Jai. VI. 3. 22 ), but he is only an agent secured by pay- 
ment and the spiritual unseen reward of the saorifice goes to 
the performer that is dead ( Jai. VI. 3. 23-25 ). The Tandya Br. 
IX. 8. 1 states that if one of the performers of a sattra dies 
after dlksa, he should be oremated, his bones should be tied 
in his antelope-skin and placed beyond the marjallya shed 
and his son or other very near relative should be given 
dlksa and be associated in the sattra. Only those who have 
conseorated the three Vedic fires can engage in sattras except 
in the Sarasvata sattra (Jai. VI. 6. 27-32 ). According to Jai. 
(VI. 6. 1-11) only those who follow the same procedure can 
join in the sattra, otherwise difficulty is oaused in the case 
of the Pray&jas and the AprI verses. The second prayaja deity 
in the oase of Vasisthas and Sunakas is Narasarhsa, while 
Tanunapat is the second prayaja deity in the oase of other 
gotras. After stating the view of Ganagari that only those 
who have the same gotra can join in a sattra, Asv.(XII. 10. 2-3) 
states the view of Saunaka ( and it is his view also ) that even 
persons of different gotras may join in a sattra, that where in a 
particular matter there is a difference of procedure in accor- 
dance with the difference of gotra, the prooedure should be regu- 
lated by the gotra of one ( called grhapati) of those who join in 
the sattra. Jai. ( VI.6.24-26) states the somewhat striking rule that 
even among brahraanas those who belong to the Bhrgu, Vasis^ha 
and Sunaka gotras cannot join in a sattra but only those who 
belong to the Visvamitra gotra or who have a similar procedure 
( about prayajas &c. ), since sruti requires that the function 
of hotr in a sattra must be performed by one belonging to 
VisvSmitra gotra. If after making a resolve to join in a sattra 
or if after just beginning a sattra a man gives up the idea, he 
had to perform by way of penance the Visvajit rite (Jai. VI. 4. 
32 and VI. 5. 25-27). 

Though in a sattra all are yajamanas yet one of them 
becomes the grhapati ; those actions whioh only one oan perform 
and which are done in other sacrifices by the yajamana ( except 
what are sarhskaras like vapana) are here done by the grhapati 
alone and others only touch him ( e. g. in tying the veda or 
placing a fuel-stick on fire, Est. XII. 1. 9-15 ). In performing 
dlksa a peculiar prooedure is followed ( Kat, XII. 2. 15, Sat. 
XVI. 1. 36, Ap. XXI. 2. 16-XXI. 3. 1 ). The adhvaryu first 
gives dlksa to the grhapati and to brahma, hotr and udg&tr ; 
the pratiprasthatr gives dlksa to adhvaryu, then to maitravaruna, 



Ch. XXXV ] GavUm-ayam 1243 

brahmanaochamsin and prastotr ; the nestr gives dlksa to the 
pratiprasthatr and the acohavaka, agnldhra and pratihartr ; the 
unnetr gives dlksa to nestr, the gravastut, and subrahmanya 
and lastly the pratiprasthatr or another brahmana (who is 
himself a dlksita) or a Veda student or snataka gives dlksa to 
unnetr. Each of the wives of all these is given dlksa along 
with her husband ( Kat. XII. 2. 16 ). Every day one of those 
who join in a sattra guards soma silently and others are 
allowed to study their Veda and to fetch fuel-sticks ( Sat. Br. 
IV. 6. 9. 7, Kat. XII. 4. 1 and 3). On the tenth day there is 
brahmodya" 80 as in Asvamedha or they engage in the abuse of 
Prajapati for having created such pests as bees and wasps and 
thieves (Ap. XXI. 12. 1-3, Sat. XVI. 4. 33-35, Kat. 
XII. 4. 21-23). 

While engaged in the sattra the performers have to 
observe certain rules ( Asv. XII. 8, Drahy3yana Sr. VII. 3-9 ff). 
From the day the dlksanlya isti is performed in the sattra, the 
usual duties to pitrs ( such as pindapitr-yajna ), to gods ( such 
as Agnihotra ) are stopped till the end of the sattra. They have 
to give up sexual intercourse and must not run, they should 
laugh covering their teeth ( so as not to show them ), should not 
jest with women, should not speak to those who are not aryas f 
should not plunge in deep water, should give up falsehood and 
anger, should not climb up trees or enter a boat or chariot. 
Rules are laid down as to whom to bow to. A sattrin should 
esohew singing, dancing and instrumental music While 
dlksas are going on he should subsist on milk. On pressing 
days he should partake of the remnants of havis only or of 
fruits and roots and other food fit for vrata. 

One of the most interesting day is the Mahavrata, whioh 
is the last day but one in a sattra. Several strange and bizarre 
rites are performed on this day. This day is so called because 
it is specially meant for Prajapati who is ' mahSn ' and maha- 
vrata means ' anna ' ( Tandya IV. 10. 2, Sat. Br. IV. 6. 4. 2 ). In 
this a mahavratlya oup of soma is offered in addition to the 

2680. The TSijdya Brahmana ( IV. 9. 12 and 14 ) speaks of both 
brahmodya and the parivodana of Prajapati ' argftefr ?«ff% wgnrefa <?9r

usual ones and a victim is slaughtered for Prajapati. In con- 
nection with this oup a mah&vrata sSman is chanted followed 
by the recitation of the Mahad-uktha ( great laudation ) of the 
hotr. Vide Haug's tr. of Ait. Br. p. 283 n, S. B. E. vol. 43 
pp. 282-283 note 5. The chanting of the Prsthastotras is 
started by a brfihmana who plays on a harp ( vana ) with a 
hundred strings of munja grass ( Sat. XVI. 7. 7-9, Tandya 
V. 6. 12—13 ). During the chanting the udgatr priest sits on a 
chair of udumbara, the hotr on a swing, the adhvaryu on a 
board and the other priests on seats of grass (Tandya V. 5. 1-12). 
A brahmana in the front part of the sadas and a sudra at the 
back alternately belaud and abuse those engaged in the sattra, 
the former saying they have done well and the latter saying 
they have not done well ( Tandya V. 5. 13 ). An Srya and a 
sudra engage to the west of the Sgnldhra shed in a contest for a 
white oircular skin that symbolizes the sun ( for whom the 
Gods and Asuras fought laying claim to the Sun as their own ), 
the fight being so arranged that it culminates in favour of the 
arya ( Tfindya V. 5. 14-17, Sat. XVI. 7. 28-32 ). A harlot and a 
brahmacSrin abuse each other on the northern hip of the altar. 

Sexual intercourse between a man and a woman ( that are 
strangers to the sacrifice ) takes place in a screened shed to the 
south of the marjallya shed ( according to Kat. XIII. 3. 9 )• 
This probably is a symbol for indicating creation of the world 
by Prajapati to whom the mahavrata specially appertains. A 
ohariot is made ready to the east of the southern oorner of the 
vedi. A noble or a ksatriya in full armour occupies it, armed 
with a bow and three arrows. He goes round the vedi thrice 
and discharges three arrows at a hide but not so as to pierce it 
through and through ( San. XVII. 15 ). 

They beat drums placed on all corners of the vedi and 
strike a bull-hide spread over a hole dug to the west of the 
fignldhrlya shed, half inside the vedi and half outside ( this is 
called ' bhumi-dundubhi ' ). When the priests chant, the wives 
of the performers act as choristers Msl to the singing priests 
( Jai. X 4. 8, Sat. XVI. 6. 21, Ap. XXI. 17. 15-16 ) and play on 
several instruments. Eight servants and maids or slaves and

slave girls, placing water jars on their beads dance thrice round 
the marjallya seat, striking the ground with their right feet 
and singing popular songs ( gathas ) in which cows ate lauded 
as mothers of ghee and whioh contain words like ' this is 
sweet • ( Sat. XVI. 6. 39-41, Ap. XXI. 19. 17-20 and XXI. 30 ). 
These features of the makavrata show that it was some 
folk festival in the hoary past and was welded on to the solemn 
vedic sacrifices as a relaxation after the weary days and 
months of sacrifices. The Ait. Ar. ( I and V ) gives an esoteric 
turn to the mahavrata. In one place it summarizes all the 
popular features of the Mahavrata. 8888 

On the Udayanlya day three anubandhya cows are 
offered to Mitr&varuna, the Visve Devas and Brhaspati ( Kat. 
XIII. 4. 4 ). 

In the Indian Antiquary, vol. 41, Dr. Sham Sastry 
contributed a series of articles on the Vedic calendar in which 
he adduced weighty arguments for holding that the GavSmayana 
was a symbolic representation of the efforts made to square up 
the Vedic lunar year with the solar year by adding intercalary 
days. It is somewhat remarkable and also indicative of the 
bias of most western scholars that while Prof. Keith in his 
work on the 'Religion and philosophy of the Veda' refers 
ad nauseam to all sorts of lucubrations by European scholars 
on the origins of the Vedic sacrifices, about rain spells and 
fertility rites and similar lore he does not condescend to 
notice the views of Dr. Sham Sastry or Mr. Tilak, which have 
far more probability than many of the learned hypotheses 
advanced by European soholars who appear to be obsessed by 
the notion that Vedio usages must be similar to practices found 
in the 19th century among the backward raoes of Africa, 
Amerioa and Oceania. 

Though the sutras speak of sattras for a hundred or a 
thousand years, there were writers even in ancient India who 
thought that suoh sattras did not exist in fact, at least in 
historical times. Patafijali states in bis Mahabhasya that 
the sattras of a hundred or a thousand years were never 
attempted in times near to his day and that Yajnikas prescribe 

2682. Bjupwrfo wt«ji% i <mf$wrft snjjw* «r«rra[ i Tnrs$or «9$

rules for them following the tradition of sages." 8 * Jaimini 
also boldly asserts that when the texts 868 * speak of Visvasrjara- 
ayana for a thousand samvatsaras the word samvatsara means 
onlyaday(Jai. VI. 7.31-40). 

Among the other sattras the Sarasvata sattras are most 
instructive, sinoe in them many places on the most sacred 
SarasvatI and other rivers were approaohed by the sacrificers 
during the course of the saorifioe." 8 * Vide Asv. XIL 6,, La>

Agnicayana ( piling of the fire-altar ) 

The construction of the fire-altar is a special rite and is the 
most, complicated and most recondite of all Srauta sacrifices. 
The Satapatha Brahmana devotes five out of its fourteen sec- 
tions ( about one-third of the whole work ) to cayana and is 
the leading work on that subject. Prof. Eggeling in his very 
learned Introduction ( pp. XIV ff ) to vol. 43 of the S. B. E. 
deals with the fundamental conceptions underlying this srauta 
ritual. Acoording to him cayana was originally an indepen- 
dent rite and was later on incorporated in the system of Soma 
sacrifices. At the bottom of this rite are certain cosmogonio 
theories. Even in the Rgveda we meet with the conceptions 
that Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati ( Rg. X..121 ) is the creator of 
the universe, that creation, destruction and re-construction of 
the universe are eternal, ever-recurring processes going on 
from all time and will go on for all time ( Rg. X. 190. 3, ' dhata 
yathapurvam-akalpayat ' ), that Purusa himself became the 
sacrificial material ( havis ) and the year and seasons aided in 
the prooesB of the reconstruction of the sacrificed and dismem- 
bered Purusa. Man himself who is a child of this process 
must also do his part in the reconstruction of the world. This 
he oan do best by identifying Fire with Prajapati ( as in Sat. 
Br. X 4. 1. 12 ) and regarding Fire as the Highest Divinity and

the source of all life and activity and the periodio performance 
of sacrifice in fire as his contribution, however small it may 
be', to the prooess of re-creation and re-construction. The re- 
constuotion of the world by Frajapati a man oan imitate by him- 
self constructing an elaborate structure with bricks. The Sat. 
Br. in several places brings out these ideas, though in a some- 
what esoteric way MM ( e. g. VI. 2. 2. 21). The tenth kanda 
( seotion ) of the Sat. Br. is the rahasya ( the esoterio doctrine ) 
of oayana. Most of the aots done in the piling up of the altar 
are a symbolic representation of the prooess of re-creation and 
re-construction as will be seen later on. In the Sat Br. the 
principal authority on this doctrine of oayana is not Yajna- 
valkya ( who is the dominating figure in the first five seotions 
of that Brahmana) but Sandilya who traces that doctrine 
through a succession of teachers to Tura Kavaseya who received 
it from Prajapati himself ( Sat. Br. IX. 5. 2. 15-16, X 4. 1. 11, 
X. 6. 5. 9 &c. ). 

A very brief description of the cayana based principally 
on Kat,, Sat., and Ap. is given below. 

The construction of the fire-altar in five layers is an 
ahga of Somayaga. But cayana is not obligatory in every 
soma saorifioe. It must however be performed in the Somayaga 
called Mahavrata ( which as stated above is the last but one 
day in Gavam-ayana). When a man desires to pile the fire 
altar, he first offers after the Full Moon isti of Phalguna ( i. e. 
on the first of the dark half) or on Magha new moon five 
animals ( viz. a man, a horse, a bull, a ram and a he-goat were 
offered, the man in a screened plaoe ). 8m The heads of the 
beasts were built up into the altar and their trunks were thrown 
in water, which was then used for making bricks from clay. 
Kat. (XVI. 1. 32) allows an option that instead of killing 
animals golden or clay heads of these may be used. In modern 
times when rarely cayana is performed only golden images of 
the above five axe taken. Then on the 8th of the dark half of 
Phalguna a horse, an ass and a he-goat are taken in procession

2687. It appears that the man was not actually killed, but was let 
off. He was to be a vaidya or ks/atriya (Kfft. XVI. 1. 17). According 
to Baud. X. 9 the beads of a vai^ya and of ahorse killed in battle are 
taken ' *hir^ ? ir»rr<«3*T «* ; ^i^r ** fSroft' tfwm wi tt^ i if«t S* mk

to the south of the ahavanlya fire ( the horse leading ) with 
their mouths to the east and the plaoe from where clay is to he 
taken is reached by the horse., To the east of the ahavanlya 
a square pit is dug and a ball of olay is put therein which 
brings the pit on a level with the surrounding ground. At the 
middle of the distance between the clay lump and the ahavanlya 
clay taken from an ant-bill is heaped. A spade one cubit long 
made of some sacrificial tree is kept to the north of the ahava- 
nlya. The ant-hill olay is plaoed on the lump of earth in the 
pit with that spade. The horse is made to plant its foot on the 
olay in the pit. He ( the priest ) draws three lines with the 
spade on that lump of clay, spreads black antelope skin to the 
north of the lump and thereon keeps a lotus leaf on which the 
lump of clay from the pit is plaoed and the corners of the skin 
are tied with a girdle of munja. He takes up the hide with 
the clay therein, raises his arms towards the east, holds the 
bundle over the animals that come baok in the reverse order 
(the goat leading). According to Ap. XVI. 3. 10 the bundle 
is plaoed on the back of the ass and brought near a tent. The 
lump is placed to the north of the ahavanlya in a tent soreened 
on all sides; then he takes the hair of the he-goat and mixes 
the hair in that lump of olay with water in whioh palasa bark 
is boiled and mixes therewith gravel, iron rust and small 
stones. From the clay thus mixed the wife of the sacrifioer ( or 
the first wife if there are several ) prepares the first brick called 
Afl&dhS, which is in measure as rnuoh as the foot of the 
saorificer, is rectangular and has three lines scratohed on it. 
The saorificer prepares an ukha ( fire-pan ) from the mixture 
of olay, whioh is one span in diameter. Aocording to some 
three pans are made. He also makes three bricks called Visva- 
jyotis, each having three lines and so marked as to show whioh 
is first, second and third. The remaining clay is called upasaya 
and is kept aside ( as it will be required later ). The ukha is 
fumigated with the smoke from seven horse-dung cakes 
kindled on the daksina fire. A square hole is dug with the 
spade referred to above, therein fuel is put and the bricks and 
the ukha ( with the mouth downwards ) are put for being baked 
and more fuel is added. He removes the coals and ashes and 
takes out during the day the bricks ( four ) and the ukha, on 
whioh the milk of a she-goat is sprinkled. Thereafter other 
brioks are made which have three lines on each, whioh are 
generally as long as the sacrifioer's foot and are baked till they 
are red. 



Oh. XXXV ] Agmcayam 1249 

The dlkaft (initiation) for the rite takes plaoe on the 
amftvasyft of Phalguna. The dlkaanlyft isti and other usual 
rites are performed. Either the yajam&na or the adhvaryu places 
the ukha on the fthavanlya and puts thereon 13 samidhs one 
span in length. The eacrificer wears a golden ornament with 
21 pendants reaching up to his navel. The ukha is taken from 
the fthavanlya to the east of the fthavanlya and is placed in a 
sikya and fire is put into it. He carries for a year or a shorter 
period (12, 6 or 3 days according to Ap. XVI. 9. 1 ) this fire 
placed in the ukha. On alternate days in the year he adores 
the fire with the Vatsapra mantras ( Vaj. S. XII. 18-28 =Rg. 
X 45. 1-11 ), takes the Visnu strides ( Vianukramas ) ; he also 
removes the ashes, puts fuel-sticks on the fire in the ukbft. 

Then follows the building of the altar. The altar has five 
layers, the first, third and fifth being arranged In the same 
pattern and the 2nd and 4th being of a different pattern from 
the 1st, 3rd and 5th. The altar may have several forms such 
as that of a drona ( trough ), a ob.ariot-wb.eel, a syena ( hawk ), 
kanka ( heron ), suparna ( eagle ) M8B &o. Vide Tai 8. V. 4. 11, 
Kat. XVI. 5. 9. The altar requires bricks of several shapes ; 
some are triangular, some are oblong, some are perfectly 
square, some are oblong plus a triangle ( in one ). They are 
not to be placed one over the other as one chooses but are 
arranged in peculiar ways, some in front, some on the sides 
and so on. A sound knowledge of geometry and mason craft 
is required in constructing the altar. Every brick is to be 
placed after repeating a mantra. The bricks have various 
names to distinguish them. For example, the brioks called 
Yajusmatl are to be used in building the body ( of the birdlike 
pattern, which is the most usual one ), but not in building the 
sides or tail of the layer. The usual mantras in laying down 
and invoking a brick are two viz.. ' tayft devatayft- ... slda ( Vaj. 
S. XII. 53, Tai. S. IV. 2. 4. 4 ) and ' tft asya suda-dohasah ' 
( Vaj. S. XIL 55, Tai. S. IV. 2. 4. 4 ). Sat. XI. 8. 18 says that 

* tayft devatayft dhruvS slda ' is repeated after each brick is 

deposited. But special mantras are prescribed in several cases 
e. g. as to the ten lokamptrfl brioks the mantra is ' lokam proa ' 
(VIJ.XII. 54, Tai. S. IV. 2. 4.4). Some kinds of brioks bear

the names of sages ( e. g. Valakhilya bricks ). Probably they 
were first used by those sages. There are three brioks whioh, 
are called svayam-StrunSb ( 1. e. they are long and thin stones 
and have natural holes ) and which are plaoed in the centre of 
the 1st, 3rd and 5th layers and are deemed to represent earth, 
air and heaven. tm Jai. ( V. 3. 17-20 ) deals with the respec- 
tive positions of certain brioks called oitrinl and lokamprna. 

On the day of the last dlksa" the measuring of the plot to be 
used as vedi takes plaoe. Measurements are made with a rope 
whioh is in length twice the height of the sacrifices A fifth 
part of the sacrificed height is oalled aratni, tenth part 
is called pada, each pada is divided into twelve angulas and 
three padas make a prakrama ( Eat. XVI. 8. 21 ). The ground 
for the uttaravedi on which the altar is to be constructed is 
ploughed with an udumbara plough and the ropes are 
made of mufija. Six, twelve or twenty-four oxen are yoked 
to the plough. He sows on the furrows made by the plough 
various kinds 8 ' 70 of corns ( Ap. XVI. 19. 11-13 says fourteen 
kinds, seven being gramya and seven wild). He omits 
one kind of corn whioh he has to abstain from partaking 
throughout life thereafter (Kat. XVIL 3. 6-7). If so many 
kinds of corn cannot be had then in those furrows barley oorn 
mixed with honey is sown. Then clods of earth are put thereon 
and the ground is made level. Several things are got ready 
and plaoed one after another on this ground ( Ap. XVL 13. 10 
where they are said to be brioks but not of clay ). Vide Sat. 
XL 5. 21 also. The placing of bricks is begun after the first 
upasad ( Sat XL 7. 2 ). A lotus leaf is first laid down on the 
spot where the horse planted its hoof ( Ap. XVI. 22. 3 ) and on 
that leaf the golden ornament worn by the yajamana at the 
time of the Visnu strides is placed with the mantra ' brahma 
jajnanam , (Vaj.S.XIII.3,Tai.S.IV. 2. 8. 2). To the south 
of that ornament is laid down the golden image of a man with 
head to the east and face turned to the sky in such a way that 
the image does not oover the hole pierced in the golden orna- 
ment ( disc ) by passing a string with which it was tied round

the neck ( the mantra repeated being very significant ' in the 
beginning Hiranyagarbha arose' Rg. X. 121. l=Vaj. S. XIII. 4). 
The sacrifioer performs the adoration ( upasthana ) to the golden 
man with the three verses ' bow to the serpents ' ( Vaj. S. XIIL 
6-8, Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3 ). One should thereafter never go to the 
north of the image from the south by passing in front of it 
( i. e. to the east of it ). By the side of the two arms of the 
golden man he places two srucs ( one of karsmarya wood filled 
with ghee near the right hand and the other of udumbara 
filled with curds near the left ) with their tops to the east. 
A brick called svayamatrnna on which ajxja is offered and over 
which the yajamana breaths is handed over to a brahmana who 
places it in the centre with the help of the adhvaryu, the 
brahmana being looked upon as fire ( Tai. S. V. 2. 8. 2 ). On 
that brick a durva creeper is placed in suoh a way that its roots 
are on the brick and its tops hang on to the ground towards the 
east. Then the brick called dviyajua is laid to the east of the 
durva, two retahsic bricks to the east of the preceding, then 
two rtavya bricks and then the Asadha brick is placed to the 
east of the preceding. On all rtavya bricks avakas ( mosslike 
plants ) are deposited. About one aratni to the south of the 
Asadha briok and to the east of the Svayamatrnna brick he 
places a living tortoise with its faoe to the east on the avaka 
plants ( Ap. XVI. 25. 1, Kat XVII. 4. 27-28 ). The tortoise is 
anointed with a mixture of ghee, honey and curds, is enveloped 
in moss covered with a net and made motionless by means 8 " 1 
of pegs ( Ap. XVII. 25. 2, Sat. XL 7. 42 ). When depositing the 
tortoise it is invoked with three verses ( Vaj. S. XIIL 30-32 ) 
which express the wish that the tortoise may go to the deep 
waters, that the sun and fire may not torment it by heat, that 
it may reaoh heavenly worlds and that divine rain may follow. 
Even in modern times a tortoise is so built up into the altar. 
A mortar' 698 and pestle of udumbara wood, eaoh one span in 
length ( the mortar being contracted in the middle and the 
pestle being rounded ) are plaoed about one aratni to the north 

2691. The tortoise was probably built up into tbe altar to imitate 
the action of PrajSpati. PrajBpati is said to have created the world 
after assuming tbe form of a tortoise. Vide note 1716 and p. 718 above. 
Or this may be a relio of the widespread usage of slaying an animal 
and burying its body under the foundation of a building, a bridge Ac 

2692. The mortar represents the yoni or womb, the ukhs represent! 
the belly, and the pestle represents 'iiino' (vide Sat. Br. VII. 5. 1. 88). 



1252 History of DharmaiMra [ Oh. XXXV 

of the svayamatrnna brick. A sttrpa also is plaeed near the 
above two ( Ap. XVI. 26. 5 ). The ukhft filled with sand, ghee 
and honey is plaoed on the mortar and offerings of ajya are 
made on it with the sruva ladle. The fire in the ukha is 
transferred to a hearth with eight brioks in the centre of the 
fifth layer, on which a second layer of eight bricks ( oalled 
punasciti ) is laid. This fire becomes the g&rhapatya for the 
Fire-altar (Sat. Br. VIII. 6. 3. 7-11, Kat. XVII. 12. 18-21 ). 
Seven pieces of gold are placed on the golden image, the first 
on the mouth, then two each on the two nostrils, the two eyes 
and two ears. In the forepart of the ukha, the heads of the five 
animals (on which ourds and honey are poured and on 
which 7 gold pieces are thrust ) are placed in a certain order. 
The human head is in the middle, to the north the heads of the 
hoTse and ram and to the south the heads of the bull and goat 
( Kat. XVII. 5. 13-18, Ap. XVI. 27. 5-19 ). According to Ap. and 
Sat. the head of a serpent also may be plaoed ( Ap. XVI. 27. 22, 
Sat. XI. 7. 63 ) or only the mantras ' namo astu sarpebbyab ' 
( Vaj. S. XIII. 6-8, Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3 ) may be recited. The 
various kinds of brioks are heaped in various directions on thiok 
mud Bpread on the above stated things so as to form the first 
layer. According to Sat. ( XI. 5. 22) each layer consists of only 
200 brioks ( 1000 for all five ), when the saorificer performs the 
cayana for the first time; he employs 2000 for all layers when he 
performs it a second time and this number goes on increasing each 
time he repeats agnicayana. 8 "* According to the Sat. Br. (S.B.E. 
vol. 43 p. 22 n. 1 ), Kat. XVII. 7. 21-23 the bricks required for 
all the five layers are 10800. The time required for piling also 
varies. Some held that the piling took one year ( 8 months 
for the first four layers and 4 months for the last ) or all 
the layers may be laid in a few days. Sat ( XII. 1. 1 ff ) and 
Ap. (XVIL1. 1-11, XVII. 2. 8, XVII. 3. 1) state that the 
five layers are laid on five successive days. On eaoh layer 
thick mud ( purlsa ) prepared from the earth (mixed with water) 
dug out of the o&tv&la pit after touohing a dark or bay horse 
that stands to the north is spread with ' prs$o divi ' ( Vaj. S. 
XVIII. 73, Tai. S. I. 5. 11. 1 quoted by Ap." XVI. 34. 6-7, 
Sat. XI. 5. ). Each layer and the spreading of mud are 
carried out eaoh day between the two upasads ( morn- 
ing one and afternoon one). When all the layers are

completed the fihavanlya fire is established on the altar so built. 
Slight dhisnyas, square or round, have to be oonstruoted with 
bricks, viz. the Sgnldhrlya and 7 others as in somayftga ( but 
the number of bricks for each differs ). A small round and 
variegated stone ( asman ) is placed to the south of the Sgnl- 
dhra's place on the northern part of the fire-altar. A fuel-stick 
is kindled on the new g&rhapatya hearth, taken over the svaya- 
mStrnna brick of the 5th layer and an offering of the milk of a 
dark cow whose calf is white is made on that fire. Satarudriya 
homa is offered to Budra. On the western corner of the 
northern side of the Fire-altar whioh is enclosed by a line of 
stones on all sides there are three stones, as high as the knee, 
naval and mouth on whioh ( serving as ahavanlya ) 425 obla- 
tions are offered to Rudra and his fearful aspects by means of 
the leaf of the Arka plant ( serving as juhu ) of wild sesame 
mixed with gavedhuka. A twig of arka plant is used to clear the 
leaf of the offerings. The priest faoes the north and makes the 
oblations standing, the -mantras being taken from the Satarudriya 
section ( bginning with ' namaste rudra manyave,' Vsj. S. 
XVI. 1-66, Tai. S. IV. 5. 1-10 ). The arka leaf and twig are 
thrown into fire. The altar is cooled by the agnldhra with the 
water from a jar which is held over the stone referred to above. 
The stone is thrown to the south of the altar with ' May sorrow 
go to him whom we hate ' ( Vfij. S. XVII. 1 ) and if it is not 
broken the adhvaryu breaks it into pieces. On a long bamboo, 
a frog, avaka plants and reed ( vetasa ) twigs are tied and 
drawn over the altar from the south hip to the south 
shoulder"'* and then they are thrown on the utkara. The 
Q&yatra, Bathantara and other samans are sung ( Sat. Br. 
IX I. 2. 35 ff, Kat. XVIIL 3. Iff). Then follow numerous 
offerings, viz. one purod&sa to Vaisv&nara and 7 purod&sas to 
the Maruts,* 6 " Vasordhar» ,,M ( stream of wealth ) offerings of 
ajya from an udumbara sruo, which is finally thrown into the 
fire, 6 Partha oblations as in Bajasuya followed later by six 

2694. This is symbolical cooling. All tbree are suggestive of 
water. 

2695. The 7th purodaia to the Maruts is called ' aranye annoya * 
because the mantra for it ' ugrasca bhiinasca ' ( Vsj. S. XXXIX. 7 ) is to 
be repeated in a forest. 

2696. VasordhSrS is the name of the whole rite in whioh several 
hundred offerings are made to Agni with mantras (VKj. 8. XVIII. 1-29, 
Tai. 8. IV. 7. 1-11, Kst. XVIII. 5. 1, Xp. XVII. 17. 8) to secure all 
powers of the Firegod to the sacrifioer. 



1254 History of Dharmaiastra [ Ch. XXXV 

more after the abhiseka of the saorificer, the Vajaprasavlya tm 
offerings of the mixture of milk and water with the gruel of 
14 gramya and wild corns with an udumbara sruva that is 
four-cornered like a caraasa ( the sruva being thrown into the 
fire at the end ). With the remnants of Vajaprasavlya offerings 
collected in a pot he sprinkles the sacrifioer who sits on a dark 
antelope skin spread on an udumbara couch to the north of the 
tail of the fire altar. A royal sacrifioer sits on a tiger skin 
and a vaisya on a goat-skin. After this six Partha offerings 
are made followed by twelve RSsfrabhrt ( supporting the king- 
dom) nomas of ajya with mantras, that contain the words ' v&t * 
and * svaha • ( Vaj. S. XVIII. 38-43, Tai. S. III. 4. 7 ). " ,B Then 
three Vafca ( wind ) homas are offered catching with his joined 
hands wind outside the vedi to the east and the three winds 
thus caught are represented as yoked to the chariot like horses* 
the mantra being Vaj. S. XVIII. 45, Tai. S. IV. 7. 12. 3 ( Kat. 
XVIII. 6. 1-3, Ap. XVII. 20. 11 ). 

Then the procedure of Somayaga is followed. One or two 
speoial characteristics may be noted. Before the Pratarami'vaka 
the Fire is represented as yoked after touching the paridhis and 
repeating three mantras ' I yoke the fire &c. ' ( Vaj. S. XVIII. 
51-53, Tai. S. IV. 7. 13. 1 ) and then Agni is released from the 
yoke before the Agnlmaruta stotra ( i. e. YajMyajnlya ) in the 
evening witti a mantra ( Va}. S. XV11I. 54, Tai. S, IV. 3. 4. % ). 
After the anubandhya pasu-purodSsa, messes of boiled rice are 
offered to Anumati, Rakfi, Sinlvall and Kuhu and a cake on 
twelve potsherds to Dhatr. At the end of the Udavasanlya 
payasyS is offered to Mitra and Varuna or he may perform 
sautrSmanl (Ap. XVII. 24. 1, Sat. XII. 7. 14 ). 

2697. The wrsroNfo is one rite in which there are two groups of 
seven offerings, the first seven with the mantras beginning ' vfijasye- 
mamprasavah'(V5j.8. IX. 23-29, Tai. S. I. 7. 10) and seven others 
with the mantras ' vSjasya nu prasave ' ( Vsj. 8. XVIII. 30-36 and Tai. 
8. I. 7. 7). Vide Sat. Br. IX. 3. 4, Sat. XII. 6. 5, Est. XVIII. 5. 4-5, 
Ap. XVII. 19. 1-3. The mantra means 'for the promotion of vigour' 
( or food ) &c. 

2698. The first mantra is 9R m qi| n^ i r%fo WyqWr>iCBT^ft jg^t

made to a male deity, and the 2nd to Apsarases variously named. 



Oh. XXXV ] Agnicayana 1255 

One who has performed the piling of the fire-altar has to 
observe certain vratas for a year viz. he should not bow to 
any one, he should not run in the rains, he should not partake 
of the flesh of any bird, he should not approach a sudra woman. 
After he performs agnioayana a second time, he should 
approaoh no woman except his own wife of the same caste, when 
he has performed cayana thrice he should not approach 8 "* even 
his own wife ( vide Ap. XVII. 24. 1-5, Kat. XVIII. 6. 25-31, Sat. 
XII. 7. 15-17 ). Jai. ( II. 3. 21-23 ) declares that the piling of 
the fire-altar is a sarhskara of fire and not an independent yaga 
by itself. 

If a man does not prosper in the year after he performs 
agnicayana he may perform punasoiti ( just as punaradheya is 
performed ). According to Ap. XVII. 24. 11 a punasciti can be 
performed for three objects, viz. for prosperity, for Vedic lore or 
for progeny.' 700 

In performing the innumerable and wearisome details of 
sacrifices many mistakes must have been committed and 
therefore the Brahmanas and Sutras presoribe numberless. expia- 
tions, some simple and others complicated. But this subject 
will be dealt with in the next volume under prayaicittas. 

In the next volume a few remarks will be offered on the 
philosophical side of sacrifices and on the causes whereby they 
gradually faded into the background and gave place to other 
religious observances. 



2699. The idea appears to have been that the saorifioer was not to 
disperse the spiritual power acquired by fire-worship, but to conserve 
it in himself.
