## CXC

*To Maharaja Ajit Singh, the Raja of Khetri*

THE MATH  
BELOOR  
HOWRAH DIST.  
\[*December 1900*\]

YOUR HIGHNESS —

Very glad to learn that you and the Coomar \[the Royal Prince\] are
enjoying good health. As for me, my heart has become very weak. Change,
I do not think, will do me any good, as for the last 14 years I do not
remember to have stopped at one place for three months at a stretch. On
the other hand, if by some chance I can live for months in one place, I
hope it will do me good. I do not mind this, however; I feel that my
work in this life is done. Through good and evil, pain and pleasure, my
life-boat has been dragged on. The one great lesson I was taught is that
life is misery, nothing but misery. Mother knows what is best. Each one
of us is in the hands of Karma — it works out itself, and no nay. There
is only one element in life which is worth having at any cost — and it
is love. Love immense and infinite, broad as the sky and deep as the
ocean. This is the one great gain in life. Blessed is he who gets it.

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
