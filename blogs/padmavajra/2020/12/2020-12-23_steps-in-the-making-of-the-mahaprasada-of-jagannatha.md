1.  After ācamana,pādya and ācamana again,the naivedya is ritually
    purified before it can be offered to Śrīpuruṣottama. For the
    offering to Puruśottama only a small portion of the bhoga is taken
    out of all the earthen pots and placed in a metallic plate in front
    of the devatās of the ratnavedī. The steps of purification of the
    naivedya before it can be offered to the devatā are as follows.
2.  Vikṣaṇa(worshipper looks at the naivedya uttering the mūlamantra
    while placing the index and thumb finger of the right hand as a span
    on the forehead,while the rest forms a fist)
3.  Prokṣaṇa:With kuśa grass in the prokṣaṇī-pātra(vessel) he sprinkles
    the naivedya thrice with the asramantra(praṇava asurāntakacakrāya
    svāha,astrāya phaṭ)
4.  Abhirakṣaṇa:The cakramudrā is deployed and the mantra (praṇava)
    namaḥ sudarśanāya astrāya phaṭ is uttered,and the naivedya is
    protected
5.  Tālatraya and digbandhana
6.  Avaguṇṭhana:Performed with the appropriate mudrā.
7.  Pariśoṣaṇa:Using the vāyubīja yaṃ the impurities of the naivedya are
    dried up
8.  Dāhana:Using the agnibīja raṃ the defilement of human touch is
    burned up,thus making it fit to be offered
9.  Āplāvana:Using the bīja of the svādhiṣṭhāna cakra,the new nectarine
    naivedya is recreated now which is entirely different from the old
    naivedya
10. Amṛtīkaraṇa:The naivedya is touched with the right hand of the
    worshipper,the mūlamantra recited 8 times and thus turned into
    amṛta. It is worshipped tulasī and candana.

Offering the naivedya to the devatā

The deity is requested to accept the naivedya with the following śloka:

devāsuramanuṣyāditṛpteḥ paramakāraṇam  
nānāvidhamayaṃ/(var.idam) deva naivedyaṃ pratigṛhyatām

The mūlamatra is uttered with the devatā taking a few drops of water in
the palm along with the words śrīkṛṣṇāya saṇgāya sarvātmane idaṃ
naivedyam svāhā and water is sprinkled with kuśa grass.

The deity is requested to take the naivedya with the formula nivedayāmī
bhagavate juṣanedaṃ havir hare and the tejas of the deity is imagined as
entering into the mouth of the deity and a few drops is offered as
āpośāna with the appropriate mantra(OṂ amṛtopastaraṇamasi svāhā)

After this the first five morsels of the naivedya is offered to the
devatā just like it happens in the bhojana of any dvija jāti. (with the
five set of mantras prānāya svāha,apānāya svāhā,vyānāya svāhā,udānāya
svāha,samānāya svahā with praṇava prefixed).

The whole naivedya is then offered to the devatā with the naivedya
mudrā/dravya mudrā with the mantra ṭhvauṃ namaḥ parāya avātmane
aniruddhāya naivedyaṃ kalpayāmi.

The offered material to Jagannātha is next offered to Bhagavatī Vimalā
as Her naivedya,and then only after that,it is known as Mahāprasāda.
