## XLII

*To Mrs. G. W. Hale*

\[WASHINGTON, D.C.

*October 27, 1894*\]

DEAR MOTHER,

I received your very kind note and all the India letters just now. I
will make it a point to see Mrs. Whitland \[?\]. I have been very kindly
treated by Mrs. \[Enoch\] Totten.

Will you kindly order 100 photographs from Harrison, and send them over
to India to Ramdayal Chakravarty, c/o Swami Ramakrishnananda,
Varahanagar Math, Alambazar, Calcutta? I will pay for it when I come to
Chicago.

I have nothing especial to write — except I had good treatment
everywhere. How I long to give up this life of weariness and blazoning
day and night.

I will go from here to New York and will come back to see you in Chicago
before I start for England.

Yours etc.,  
VIVEKANANDA
