## ON THE SEA'S BOSOM

(Swami Vivekananda composed this poem in [Bengali](6216.pdf) during his
return from his second trip to the West. At the time of writing it, he
was probably crossing the eastern Mediterranean.)

In blue sky floats a multitude of clouds —  
White, black, of snaky shades and thicknesses;  
An orange sun, about to say farewell,  
Touches the massed cloud-shapes with streaks of red.

The wind blows as it lists, a hurricane  
Now carving shapes, now breaking them apart:  
Fancies, colours, forms, inert creations —  
A myriad scenes, though real, yet fantastic.

There light clouds spread, heaping up spun cotton;  
See next a huge snake, then a strong lion;  
Again, behold a couple locked in love.  
All vanish, at last, in the vapoury sky.

Below, the sea sings a varied music,  
But not grand, O India, nor ennobling:  
Thy waters, widely praised, murmur serene  
In soothing cadence, without a harsh roar.
