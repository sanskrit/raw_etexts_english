This lovely verse by the chaaNDala-kavi maata\~Nga divaakara shows us
the skill of poets even from the lowest varNas and flies in the face of
allegations of social mobility in Ancient India. The kavi was the court
poet of Emperor HarSha and one of his nine jewels, nava ratna.  
  
`किं वृत्तान्तैः परगृहगतैः किंतु नाहं समरथस्तूष्णीं स्थातुं प्रकृतिमुखरो दाक्षिणात्यस्वभावः ।देशे देशे विपणिषु तथा चत्वरे पानगोष्ठ्याम्उन्मत्तेव भ्रमति भवतो वल्लभा हन्त कीर्तिः`

“Why bother with the affairs of another man’s house? But I cannot
control myself  
It is indeed my southern nature to be loquacious. Ah well, your
intxociated lover, she wanders about everywhere: in market-stalls and in
drinking parlors!

Such fame!”
