## CXIV

(*Translated from [Bengali](b8384e8114.pdf)* )

*To Swami Brahmananda*

LAHORE,  
*11th November, 1897*.

MY DEAR RAKHAL,

The lecture at Lahore is over somehow. I shall start for Dehra Dun in a
day or two. I have now postponed my tour to Sind, as none of you are
agreeable to it, and also because of various other obstacles. Somebody
has opened my two letters from England on the way. So don't send me
letters any further for the present. Send them after I have written for
them from Khetri. If you go to Orissa, then make arrangements that some
one will do all the work as your representative — say Hari, especially
now, when I am daily expecting letters from America.

Perhaps the will that I asked you to make in favour of Hari and Sharat
has now been made.

Probably I shall leave Sadananda and Sudhir here after establishing a
Society. Now no more lecturing — I go in a hurry straight to Rajputana.

The establishment of the Math must have precedence over everything.

Without regular exercise the body does not keep fit; talking, talking
all the time brings illness — know this for certain. My love to all.

Yours affectionately,  
VIVEKANANDA.
