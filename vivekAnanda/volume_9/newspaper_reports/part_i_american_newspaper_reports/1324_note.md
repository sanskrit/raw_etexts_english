## NOTE

To preserve the historical authenticity of these newspaper reports,
their original spelling, grammar and punctuation have been retained. For
the sake of clarity, Swami Vivekananda's original words have been placed
in block quotations and titles supplied by the Publisher have been
marked with asterisks. Whenever possible, the original news typescripts
have been selected, rather than their belated foreign reprints.
