A commentator of the Mahiabharaita who has suffered undeserved neglect 
at the hands of scholars and publishers alike is Arjunamisra. Not only is 
Arjuna's commentary better than that of NJlakaii^itha, his text also is supe- 
rior, in many respects, to that used or fixed by the Western commentator. 
And yet Arjuna’s Dtpikd has never been published in its entirety^ and, being 
difficult of access, is seldom consulted by scholars. Holtzmann has devoted 
a paragraph to him in his compendious work Das Mahdbhdrata, Vol. 3, pp. 
67 ff., but WiNTERNiTZ does not mention him even once in the 130 pages he 
devotes to the Mahabharata in his Geschichte. He is referred to en passant 
by Brockhaus, ZDMG, 6. 528 ; by Telang, Bhagavadglta Translation ; by 
Rajendralal Mitra, Notices, Vbls. 5 and 6 ; and in some other manuscripts 
catalogues. 

The version of Arjunamisra, as I pointed out in the Foreword (p. v) 
to the first fascicule of the critical edition of the Mahabhalrata (1927), is 
closely allied to the Bengali version. The simple reason for this affinity, 
not known to me then, is apparently that Arjunamisra was a native of Bengal, 
to judge from the extracts from the colophons of his commentary recently 
published by Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasada Shastri in the Descriptive 
Catalogue of Sanskrit Mmu^cripts of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. 5 
(1928). 

The few facts about Arjunamisra and his commentary that 1 have been 
able to glean from the various available sources may be briefly summarized 
thus. The name of his commentary is variously given as {Mahd-)bhdratdr- 
tha- £566} {pra)dipikd and Bharatasamgrahadipikd. The commentaries on 
the different Parvans have been handed down singly or in groups of a few 
Parvans at a time. Complete manuscripts of the commentary exist in Bengal, 
but even there they are not common. The manuscripts, which are written 
in Bengali and Devanagari characters, bear various dates in the seventeenth 
or later centuries : the ea:rliest hitherto reported date is Samvat 1676 {ca. 
A.D. 1620). 

Arjunamisra, who styles himself Bharatiacarya in the colophons of the 
manuscripts of his commentary, was the son of Is^a, who was a “ reciter 
{pdthaka or pdthakctrdja) of the Mahabharata and who appears to have, 
like his son, borne the title Bhiaratacarya. Arjuna is cited by name, by

NJlakan^tha once in his commentary on the Mahabharata 3. 291. 70) and 
is, therefore, certainly anterior to Nilakai^tha, who belongs to the third 
quarter of the seventeenth century.^ He in turn mentions among his 
predecessors the commentators Devabodha, Vimalabodha, tSapdilya, Sarvajha- 
Narayaiaa, and he ai>pears to have based his scholium closely on that of 
Devabodha. He wrote also a commentary on the well-known Vedic hymn 
Puru^asukta, to which he himself refers in the Dtpik3 on Mbh. 14. 25. 26. 
Telang {op, cit. p. 204) surmises that he is posterior to sSaipkara, and 
Holtzmann assigns him to the thirteenth or fourteenth century : both with- 
out adducing any cogent reasons for their assumptions. Arjuna regarded 
and has treated the Harivairm as an integral part of the Great Epic, elabo- 
rately defending this position : his commentary, therefore, embraces the 
supplement Harivaipisa also. 

Arjunamisra lived in North India, in a town or village on the banks of 
the Ganges and, according to his own statement, compiled the great commen- 
tary on the Mahabharata under the patronage of one Satyakhlana. £567} Re- 
lying on one Bengal Asiatic Society's manuscript examined by him, Hara- 
prasada Shastri asserts that Arjuna was a Varendra Brahman of North 
Bengal. The Mahamahopadhyaya may indeed be right in this, but I am 
not wholly convinced. I find it a suspicious circumstance that this word 
Vaiendra occurs only in one place in one manuscript (No. 3422), while it is 
conspicuous by its absence in the others which contain a similar colophon. 
There is, however, another word which is often repeated in these colc^hons but 
not discussed by the Mahamahopadhyaya and which I think also contains a 
place name. The word is spelt in the colophons variously as Campahev(t)iya, 
Campahethi, Campih^ika. It is used there as an attribute of Kula. I take 
the reference to mean that Arjunamisra's family {ktda) belonged to a town 
or village, called Campaheft(t)i- Could this place be identified with cer- 
tainty, we should have a very definite clue as to ArjunamisrpTs provenance. 
I am tempted to identify it with Campah^ti mentioned in the Imperial Gazet- 
teer oj India (1885) as a small village. . . .15 miles south-west of Calcutta, 
in the district of the Twenty-four Pargarnasi, Bengal ” ; but owing partly to 
the erratic manner in which proper names are spelt in the Imperial Gazet- 
teer and partly to the lack of sufficient data as to the situation of the place 
in question, the identificaticm proposed above is necessarily uncertain. 

Following the example of my predecessors, I halve utilized Devanagari 
manuscripts of the commentary of Arjunamisra and treated his version as a 
sub-division of the Devaniagari version. The two Devanagari manuscripts 
I am using for my edition of the Adiparvah are extremely corrupt. In fact 
all the manuscripts I have consulted-^and they are all Nagaii manuscripts 
— ^have been surprisingly corrupt. Not only that, the text they contain is

obviously contaminated from the vulgate text, as evidenced { 568 } by the 
glaring discrepancies that exist between the readings of the text and the 
lemmata in the commentary. This corruption of the Devanagaii manus- 
cripts I could not understand at first, but is, I cannot but think now, due 
to their being copies of Bengali originals. It would, therefore, be expedient 
to secure and use, whenever possible, good old Bengali manuscripts of Arju- 
namiSra’s commentary, treating his version as an offshoot of the Bengali 
vcrsiwi. Arjunamisra certainly seems to belong to the Eastern school of 
Mahabhiarata commentators.
