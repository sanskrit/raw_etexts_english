80 OAKLEY STREET,  
CHELSEA,  
*1st November, 1895*.

DEAR FRIEND (Mr. E. T. Sturdy),

The tickets of the Balleren (?) Society are 35 in number.

The subject is "Indian Philosophy and Western Society". Chairman blank.

As you did not ask me to send them over, I do not. I got your letters
properly.

Yours in the *Sat*,

VIVEKANANDA.
