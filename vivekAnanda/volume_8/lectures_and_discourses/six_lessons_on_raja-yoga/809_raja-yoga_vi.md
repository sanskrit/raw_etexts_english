## RAJA YOGA SIXTH LESSON

(These lessons are composed of notes of class talks given by Swami
Vivekananda to an intimate audience in the house of Mrs. Sara C. Bull, a
devoted American disciple, and were preserved by her and finally printed
in 1913 for private circulation — *Ed*.)

Sushumnâ: It is very useful to meditate on the Sushumna. You may have a
vision of it come to you, and this is the best way. Then meditate for a
long time on that. It is a very fine, very brilliant thread, this living
passage through the spinal cord, this way of salvation through which we
have to make the Kundalini rise.

In the language of the Yogi, the Sushumna has its ends in two lotuses,
the lower lotus surrounding the triangle of the Kundalini and the top
one in the brain surrounding the pineal gland; between these two are
four other lotuses, stages on the way:  
        6th. Pineal Gland.  
        5th. Between the Eyes.  
        4th. Bottom of the Throat.  
        3rd. Level with the Heart.  
        2nd. Opposite the Navel.  
        1st. Base of Spine.

We must awaken the Kundalini, then slowly raise it from one lotus to
another till the brain is reached. Each stage corresponds to a new layer
of the mind.
