title = "The puzzling amnesia"

+++
A number of threads suddenly converged in this direction:  
Sharada mentioned that some scholarly advaitins on a web-list saw
similarity between Sufism and advaita\! She said it is really
interesting that these scholarly Hindus are so utterly lacking in
historical sense. I could not agree more. Another thread arose over a
discussion on the events in Gorakhpur. The parallel to the situation
when the Dravidians emerged suddenly from the woodwork during the
unfolding at Kanchipuram cannot be missed, but this time the Ghazis are
the doers. Time and again we hear that the Hindus are the demons and
that the Meccan fiends are innocent lambs taken to have their throats
slit. How come the Hindus have been seized by such apasmara? Perhaps the
failure to worship skanda for millenia I mused.

There was an
[article](http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=26769)
of some interest attempting to analyze Mohammedanism. It got many points
correct which is surprising for a body from the American right. To give
the authors credit, they do give some coverage to the assault on Hindus
by Mohammedans, and even have a book titled:”Mohammed, Allah, and
Hinduism … The Foundational Doctrine”. Most usefully they have a books
titled “A simple Koran” and “The Political Traditions of Mohammed” which
give a decent introduction to the Mohammedan doctrine for a Kaffir.

The Hadith of Bukhari 4.62.267 states that their Rasool said: “The king
of Persia will be destroyed, and no one shall assume his throne. Caesar
will certainly be destroyed and no Caesar will follow him; his coffers
will be spent in Allah’s cause.”

There is some significance to these statements. They indeed turned out
to be true- the Parsis are actually literally nearing extinction. They
have few memories of how many of them died or who killed them. The Roman
empire has lost Turkey and indeed coffers of the West, self-professed
successors of the Caesar have funded Allah’s cause: 1) We faithfully
coughed up our tax dollars to fund Clinton war in the Balkans to help
Allahists to triumph over the Serbians. 2) The same tax dollars funded
Moslems of the Terrorist State and Bangladesh to kill Hindus in the
pretext of saving Afghanistan from communism. 3)The triumph of the
Moslems in Afghanistan and Chechnya against the Russians and its
karma-phala in the form of the events of 9/11 are all from the Caesar’s
coffers. 4)The killing of the secular Saddam to bring an assortment of
Islamists to power in Iraq is again funded by the very same pelf from
the Caesar’s coffers. 5) The erection of an edifice of perdition, the
dung-pile of Saudi Arabia, is all driven by the Caesar’s coffins. No
doubt the Islamists feel so triumphant.

It is estimated that the Islamic Jihad has killed:  
80 \* 10^6 Hindus  
60 \* 10^6 Christians  
10 \* 10^6 Non-Indian bauddhas  
50 \* 10^6 Black Africans  
Un-estimated Parsis, Manichaeist Uighurs and others. While these numbers
need greater scrutiny, they are not implausible. Yet it is a mystery
that the survivors of the greatest genocide in history exhibit such
amnesia over its cause- Mohammedanism. So much so that they fund the
Meccan fiends with their own coffers (as “prophesied” by Mohammad) to
continue their unabated carnage. I am yet to see a full analysis of this
profound amnesia.
