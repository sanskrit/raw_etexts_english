title = "The mantra-s of the kubjikA-mantra-mAlA"

+++
The kubjikA mantra mAlA is one of the remnants of the once active
kubjikA-mata system that currently survives in southern India. Text is a
collection of mantra-s which are deployed like a stotra by the votary in
worshiping kubjikA. The average tAntrika typically does not know of the
mantra sAdhana-s of the individual mantra-s and simply uses them as
though the whole mantra mAlA were a stuti to accompany the worship of
durgA. Further, the published texts of the mantra mAlA have several
corrupt readings – at least those in drAviDa and nAgarI lipi-s; I do not
know of the state of the versions published in the Andhra lipi. Again
some upAsaka-s state that they use it prior to the worship of vanadurgA
and others state that they use it before the worship of chaNDikA (the
devatA of mArkaNDeya’s saptashatI). Tradition has it that these mantra-s
were from the lost gaurI tantra of the kubjikA kula tradition.

I am attempting to correct the readings as per my tradition:

This kubjikA mantra-mAlA has close resemblance to the siddha-kun\~njikA
stotra (SKS) which is used with the mArkaNDeya saptashatI and belongs to
the vana-durgA tradition. The SKS exists in two recensions which are
respectively supposed to have come from the gaurI-tantra (like the above
stotra) and the DAmara tantra. On the face of it both the kubjikA mantra
mAlA and the two versions of the SKS have a stotra section that clearly
describes chaNDikA of the mArkaNDeya puraNa. In the case of the SKS from
the gaurI tantra the mantra-s at the beginning of the stotra are from
the chaNDikA tradition based on the navAkSharI vidyA (aiM hrIM klIM
chAMuNDAyai vicche ||). Hence, it would seem that the southern kubjikA
tradition at some point “recycled” and incorporated this text from the
vana-durgA tradition. The SKS’s association with the saptashatI appears
to have also resulted in the votaries believing that the kubjikA mantra
mAlA is used before the saptashatI just as the ku\~njikA text.
