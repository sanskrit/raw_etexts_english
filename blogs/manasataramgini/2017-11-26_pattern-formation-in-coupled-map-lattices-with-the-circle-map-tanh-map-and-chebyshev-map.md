title = "Pattern formation in coupled map lattices with the circle map, tanh map, and Chebyshev map"

+++
The coupled map lattices (CMLs), first defined by Kunihiko Kaneko around
the same time Wolfram was beginning to explore cellular automata,
combine features of cellular automata with chaotic maps. The simplest
CMLs are defined on a one dimensional lattice with
![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "n")
cells. The value of the
![j^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"j^{th}") cell in the lattice generated by a combination of the action
of a chaotic mapping function
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f(x)") and coupling of that value with the values of adjacent cells.
Imagine a CML where the
![j^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"j^{th}") cell is coupled with the two cells on either side
![j-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"j-1") and
![j+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"j+1") with a coupling fraction of ![\\epsilon \\in
\[0,1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+%5Cin+%5B0%2C1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon \\in [0,1]"). Then, the value of this cell in the next
generation
![(n+1)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%2B1%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"(n+1)") (indicated as a superscript) of the CML is given by:

![x\_j^{n+1} =
(1-\\epsilon)f\\left(x\_j^n\\right)+\\dfrac{\\epsilon}{2}\\left(f\\left(x\_{j-1}^n\\right)+f\\left(x\_{j+1}^n\\right)\\right)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_j%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+%3D+%281-%5Cepsilon%29f%5Cleft%28x_j%5En%5Cright%29%2B%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%7B2%7D%5Cleft%28f%5Cleft%28x_%7Bj-1%7D%5En%5Cright%29%2Bf%5Cleft%28x_%7Bj%2B1%7D%5En%5Cright%29%5Cright%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_j^{n+1} = (1-\\epsilon)f\\left(x_j^n\\right)+\\dfrac{\\epsilon}{2}\\left(f\\left(x_{j-1}^n\\right)+f\\left(x_{j+1}^n\\right)\\right)")

Thus, the CML adds a further level of complexity coming from the chaotic
behavior of the map defined by
![f(x)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"f(x)") to [the basic one dimensional cellular automaton
principle](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/some-lessons-we-learned-from-3-color-totalistic-cellular-automata/).

One map of interest that can be played on a CML is the circle map
discovered by the famous Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold, which he
proposed a simple model for oscillations such as the beating of the
heart. It essentially performs the operation of mapping a circle onto
itself:

![x\_{n+1}=x\_n+\\Omega-\\dfrac{K}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot
x\_n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3Dx_n%2B%5COmega-%5Cdfrac%7BK%7D%7B2%5Cpi%7D%5Csin%282%5Cpi+%5Ccdot+x_n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=x_n+\\Omega-\\dfrac{K}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi \\cdot x_n)")

Figure 1 shows the the iterates of
![x\_0=\\tfrac{1}{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0%3D%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_0=\\tfrac{1}{3}") for
![K=.9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%3D.9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"K=.9") and ![\\Omega \\in
\[0,1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega+%5Cin+%5B0%2C1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\Omega \\in [0,1]"). We observe that there are several regions where
the circle map generates chaotic behavior and other bands where it is
mostly non-chaotic. Also visible more subtly are regions of
less-preferred values.

[![Circle\_map](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/circle_map.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/circle_map.png)Figure
1

We then play the circle map on a CML of 101 cells by keeping
![K=0.9](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%3D0.9&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"K=0.9") and varying
![\\Omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\Omega") to take multiple values. We take the coupling fraction
![\\epsilon=0.5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.5"), which we found experimentally to give interesting
results. We initialize the CML by setting the value of cell 51 to 0.5,
and setting the 50 flanking cells on either side of it to the value of 0
in generation
![n=1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"n=1"). We then let it evolve such that if the cell on either edge of
the lattice are neighbors of each other — thus the CML here is in
reality plays out on a cylinder. Each value of
![\\Omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\Omega") results in a different kind of behavior of the circle map
(The left panels in Figure 2). The corresponding evolution of the CML is
shown in Figure 2, for 500 generations going from left to right.

[![kaneko\_circle\_1](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kaneko_circle_1.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kaneko_circle_1.png)Figure

1\) In the first case one can see that the map converges to a single
value after a brief initial fluctuation. Correspondingly, when played on
the CML it results in the seed anisotropy quickly dying off and the CML
settles into a constant state.  
2\) In the second case the circle map shows an oscillation with a
gradual concave rise and a sharp fall. While the oscillations are
roughly similar in shape they are not identical. This results in the CML
rapidly evolving into a complex pattern. The triangular elements seen in
the pattern are reminiscent of those which emerge in cellular
automata.  
3\) In this case the circle map generates sharp approximately regular
pattern of oscillations, with rapid, abrupt changes in values. The
corresponding CML evolves into a basic pattern of waves. Central seed
sets up a pattern that develops into a fairly fixed width pattern the
keeps propagating independent of the background waves.  
4\) Here, the circle map generates oscillations similar to above but
slightly less-abrupt and has a more convex descending branch. This
results in a more complex pattern developing from the central cell that
stands out more clearly from the background waves. It gradually grows in
width and shows a central band and flanking elements.  
5\) In this case the circle map generates oscillations with an abrupt
rise and gradual, convex fall. This again, like case 2, rapidly
generates a complex pattern.

To investigate the effect of other types of chaotic oscillations applied
to the CML, we next considered the tanh map which is based in the
hyperbolic tangent function. It is defined thus:

If
![x\_n\<0](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n%3C0&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n\<0"),
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2}{\\tanh(r)}\\tanh(r(x\_n+1))-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Ctanh%28r%29%7D%5Ctanh%28r%28x_n%2B1%29%29-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2}{\\tanh(r)}\\tanh(r(x_n+1))-1"),

else,
![x\_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2}{\\tanh(r)}\\tanh(-r(x\_n-1))-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B2%7D%7B%5Ctanh%28r%29%7D%5Ctanh%28-r%28x_n-1%29%29-1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=\\dfrac{2}{\\tanh(r)}\\tanh(-r(x_n-1))-1")

This maps ![x\_n \\in \[-1,1\] \\rightarrow
\[-1,1\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n+%5Cin+%5B-1%2C1%5D+%5Crightarrow+%5B-1%2C1%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n \\in [-1,1] \\rightarrow [-1,1]"). Figure 3 shows a plot of
iterations of
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") for the parameter ![r \\in
(0,10\]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%5Cin+%280%2C10%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r \\in (0,10]"). For
![r\<1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3C1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r\<1") the distribution of
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") is all over the place. For
![r\>1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3E1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"r\>1") the distribution of
![x\_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_n&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_n") becomes more and more U-shaped with a preference for values
closer to 1 or -1.

[![tanh\_chaos](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tanh_chaos.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tanh_chaos.png)Figure
3

We then play the above tanh map on the CML with 101 cells initialized
with a central cell (51)
![x\_{51}^1=.5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B51%7D%5E1%3D.5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{51}^1=.5") for 500 generations. The coupling fraction is chosen as
![\\epsilon=0.1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.1"). The experiment is run for different values of the
parameter
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r").
These results are shown in figure 4.

[![Kaneko\_tanh2](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kaneko_tanh2.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kaneko_tanh2.png)Figure
4

The first two values of
![r](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0 "r")
are in that part of the parameter space of the tanh map that produces
highly chaotic oscillations. This results in the CML quickly evolving
into nearly random continuous variation.

In the next three cases the effects of the U-shaped distribution of the
iterates kicks in and we have predominantly abrupt up-down oscillations
of the tanh map. However, the subtle difference in the oscillations
causes clearly distinct results, albeit with some common features. In
the third example, surprisingly, the CML quickly converges and freezes
into several tracks of distinct periodic patterns. In the fourth and
fifth case, we see tracks with patterns similar to those seen in the
above case. However, they do not freeze, at least in the 500 generations
we ran them. Rather, the tracks persist for different number of
generations and then become extinct or evolve into other patterns after
persisting for even 100 or more generations. These more regular patterns
play out in a more irregular rapidly changing background.

In the last experiment presented here we consider the effect of the
coupling fraction
![\\epsilon](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon") on long-term dynamics. For this purpose we use the
Chebyshev map, which is related to the eponymous polynomials of that
famous Russian mathematician.

![x\_{n+1}=\\cos(a \\cdot
\\arccos(x\_n))](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bn%2B1%7D%3D%5Ccos%28a+%5Ccdot+%5Carccos%28x_n%29%29&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{n+1}=\\cos(a \\cdot \\arccos(x_n))")

This surprisingly simple map produces extreme chaos with a distribution
similar to the tanh map for values of the parameter
![a\>1.5](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3E1.5&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a\>1.5"). Values of
![a=1.5:2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1.5%3A2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1.5:2") produce interesting behavior in CMLs. In our experiment the
we keep the Chebyshev map itself the same for all runs with
![a=1.8](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D1.8&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"a=1.8"). Figure 5 shows the chaotic pulsations produced by this
Chebyshev map.

[![Chebyshev\_map](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/chebyshev_map.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/chebyshev_map.png)Figure
5

In this case the CML was run for 5000 generations and every 10th
generation was plotted. It was initialized with the central cell
![x\_{51}^1=0.1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7B51%7D%5E1%3D0.1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_{51}^1=0.1") and each of the flanking 50 cells on either side were
set to
![x\_j^1=-0.75](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_j%5E1%3D-0.75&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"x_j^1=-0.75"). Here, the
![\\epsilon](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon") value is varied to establish the effects of coupling on the
behavior of the CML. This is shown in figure 6

[![Kaneko\_Chebyshev](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kaneko_chebyshev.png?w=640)](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kaneko_chebyshev.png)Figure
6

The behavior is rather interesting:  
1\) At
![\\epsilon=0.05](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.05&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.05") we observe that randomness permeates the entire
evolution of the CML.  
2\) At
![\\epsilon=0.075](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.075&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.075") there is a fall in randomness with repeated emergence
of lines of persistence, lasting for several generations before going
extinct. Some times they reappear several 100s of generations later.
Within, each line, while it lasts, we see some fluctuations in
intensity.  
3\) At
![\\epsilon=0.085](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.085&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.085"), the randomness mostly dies out by one fourth of the
total number of generations of the CML’s evolution. Thereafter, barring
the fringes, the lines of persistence alone remain over the rest of the
evolution, albeit with some fluctuations of intensity within each
line.  
4\) Interestingly, at
![\\epsilon=0.095](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.095&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.095") we observe the emergence of “wandering” chaotic lines
that emerge from old or spawn new lines of persistence.  
5\) At ![\\epsilon=0.105,
0.115](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.105%2C+0.115&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.105, 0.115") we observe that most of the CML rapidly
settles down in to strong unchanging lines of persistence.  
6\) The
![\\epsilon=0.13](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.13&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.13") shows similar behavior to the above, except that
certain lines of persistence display a periodic variation within them
like a regular wave.  
6\) At
![\\epsilon=0.16](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3D0.16&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon=0.16"), we interesting see the return of chaos with repeated
episodes of chaotic behavior breaking up old lines of persistence
followed by emergence of new lines of persistence.  
7\) Finally, in the last two runs we see a return to the predominantly
random pattern. However, this is qualitatively different from the first
case in that it shows some short lines of persistence, which establish
small domains of local structure.

Thus, the degree of coupling between the cells of the lattice affect the
long term evolution of the system for same initial conditions and
driving chaotic oscillator. In the range of
![\\epsilon](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\epsilon") explored above we see an optimal point for freezing of
persistent patterns with randomness dominating in the extremes of the
range. However, within the more “orderly” zone we may see outbreaks of
mixed chaos and pattern-persistence.

Simple CMLs are computational elementary and conceptually
easy-to-understand as simple cellular automata. In some ways they
captures natural situations more closely than cellular automata. But on
the other hand extracting interesting behavior from them appears to be
more difficult. Importantly, they are unique in providing a tractable
model for how the local chaotic oscillations couples with other such
oscillators. This is seen in many biological systems — networks of
neurons, interacting bacterial cells in a colony, colonial amoebozoans
and heteroloboseans — all are good natural systems for real-life CMLs to
play out. We see chaotic oscillatory patterns in individual cells, which
if coupled appropriately, can result in regularized patterns after some
generations or rounds of interactions. Both nature of the underlying
chaotic oscillator and the degree of coupling will determine whether
randomness, frozen patterns, or dynamic but not entirely random patterns
dominate. This gives an opening for an important force, namely natural
selection, that is often neglected in such dynamical systems-based
approaches. Selection is required for setting up the oscillator and its
parameters as also the coupling fraction. Further, like CAs, CMLs also
have potential as historical models, where local oscillations in
populations and their interactions could be captured by the coupling of
the chaotic oscillators.
