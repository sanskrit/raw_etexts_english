+++
After 1370 CE the power of the Qubilaid Mongols declined precipitously
leaving Mongolia in chaos, with several contenders jostling for
supremacy but none gaining any ground. As they were fighting each other,
the Kirghiz lord Ugechi routed the Qubilaid Khan Elbek and killed him in
a battle in 1399 CE. He then declared himself the overlord of the
Mongols. The resurgent nationalist Han under the aggressive Ming ruler
Yung Lo harbored a deep resentment against the Qubilaids for their
conquest of the Hans. Seeing an opportunity to end the Qubilaids once
and for all he sent an emissary to immediately recognize Ugechi as the
supreme ruler. However, around the same time, (i.e. towards the end of
the 1300s) a new Mongol confederation of tribes, the Oirat arose in
Western Mongolia under their leader Mahamu. He formed an alliance with
the chief of the Mongolized Arans (Alan; Airya\>Ara), who were
late-surviving steppe Iranians who had been close to the Qubilaids.
Initially, they acted as though restoring Qubilaid power by overthrowing
Ugechi and killing him. However, Mahamu subsequently grew in ambition.
Hence, he sent an emissary of peace to the Ming to secure his southern
underbelly. The Ming who were keen to get eliminate the Chingizids once
and for all, agreed for peace with Mahamu and urged him to destroy his
erstwhile overlords. Mahamu quickly exploited to this lull to conquer
most of the territory from the western shores of the Baikal to the
Irtysh river. Indeed, the Chingizids of the Qubilaid line might have
waned into anonymity had they found a new leader in the form of the
direct descendent of Qubilai Khan, Puṇyaśrī Oljei Temür. On one hand
Puṇyaśrī was a learned Sanskritist, with literary interests going
beyond the vajrayāṇa tantra-s and encompassing the works of Daṇḍin and
Bhojadeva Paramāra. On the other he was a vigorous warrior who started
rebuilding the Mongol army and drew back the Arans to his side. He
repulsed the Ming thrusts into Mongolia and struck out at the Chinese
forces in several encounters to the south. However, in 1411 CE, the Ming
ruler Yung Lo personally lead a gigantic Chinese army northwards with
the express objective of exterminating the Chingizid Mongols. As
Puṇyaśrī was being pinned down the by this Chinese assault, his
coethnic Mahamu launched a surprise attack on him seized the kingship of
Mongolia. Yung Lo alarmed at Mahamu’s rise turned his massive Chinese
force across the Gobi against him. However, this was a bad move on his
part for it allowed Mahamu to cut off his supplies and ambush his forces
inflict heavy losses on the Chinese.

Taking advantage of this situation, Puṇyaśrī restored himself as the
lord of Mongolia and resumed the war with the Chinese to take Gansu and
Ningxia from them. Yung Lo finally retaliated in 1423 CE by launching a
counter-attack on Mongolia. Puṇyaśrī used a similar strategy as Mahamu
to draw him across the Gobi and ambush him, forcing the Chinese to
retreat without any gains. However, his triumph was short lived for in
1424 CE the Arans and Puṇyaśrī had a falling out and the latter was
killed in the conflict. Then Mahamu’s son Toghon Temür, who had
succeeded his father, fell upon the Arans and routed them. They fled
eastwards to Manchuria where they joined the horde of Adai the
descendant of Qasar, the brother of Chingiz Khan, who made an attempt to
establish himself as the lord of the Mongols. Adai defeated both the
Chinese army sent against him and Toghon Temür to briefly establish
himself as lord of Mongolia in 1425 CE, for the first time under a
Qasarid emperor. But Toghon Temür patiently rebuilt his army and in 1428
CE and consolidated his power to the west by attacking Vais Khan, the
Chagadaid ruler who wanted to wage a Jihad on the heathen Mongols. He
routed Vais Khan in multiple battles and seized the Turfan basin from
him. Having thus created strategic depth for himself in 1436CE he
finally launched a major attack on Adai and slew him in a great battle
for Mongolia.

Thus, Toghon Temür became the emperor of Mongolia by 1438CE and at his
death passed his incipient empire on to his son Esen Taiji. On coming to
power Esen started on an ambitious program of restoring unified heathen
Mongol power. He began with a series of campaigns against the Mohammedan
Chagadaids and brought them down in a battle fought on the shores of the
Balkash. In the process he seized the Chagadaid princess Makhtum Khanim
and made several renounce Mohammedanism. Esen Taiji then rapidly moved
east to conquer the Hami oasis and in 1445 CE opened hostilities with
the Ming and conquered Jehol from them. Esen then asked the Ming emperor
to send his sister as his wife but was refused. He retaliated with a
fierce attack on Tatung. The enraged young Ming emperor Zhu Qizhen
(Zhengtong) marched against the Mongols with a large army directed by
the castrato Wang Zhen. The Chinese decided to launch a counter-punch by
invading Mongolia from the Southeast. Esen took a leaf of Chingiz Khan’s
book and by means of swift secret marches intercepted the vast Chinese
army unexpectedly as they were passing through the Chahar province. In
an epic battle that took place at Tumu (near Suanhwa) in 1449 CE, Esen’s
forces annihilated the Chinese army, killing over 100,000 of their men.
Encircled by the Mongols, the Ming emperor Zhu Qizhen was taken captive.
Three months later Esen Taiji marched against Beijing but lacking the
genius of the great Chingiz Khan failed to take the city and running out
of fodder for this horses returned to his territory with his royal
prisoner. Unable to take the Ming capital he released his prisoner in
1450 CE and concluded a peace agreement with the Chinese. He then turned
his attention west to conquer the ulus of the Chagadaid Toqtoa-buga and
slew him.

Amasanji Taiji succeeded his father Esen in 1456 CE. His father, like
other religiously liberal heathen Mongol rulers of the past, had allowed
a few mullahs to settle in his territory. They were secretly instigated
by the Mohammedan Chagadaid princesses whom they had captured to convert
two royal Oirat Mongols to Mohammedanism as Ibrahim Ong and Ilyas Ong.
These two established communication with the Chagadaid Khan Yunus and
together started importing mullahs to conduct extensive missionary
activity inside the Oirat Mongol empire. Together with the mullahs,
Chagadaid backers and the new converts, Ibrahim and Ilyas initiated a
Jihad against the heathen Mongols. Amasanji woke up to the threat as the
rioters were approaching his camp. Realizing the great threat the
Mongols faced he decisively retaliated by slaughtering the ghāzis in his
kingdom. However, Ibrahim and Ilyas managed to escape to China with Ming
assistance. Around 1460CE, Amasanji moved west to tackle the Mohammedan
threat by invading the Chagadai ulus of Mogholistan and overthrowing
Khan Yunus. He then moved against the Khan Abu’l Khair who sought to
unify the Chagadais and the Jochids in an Islamic alliance against the
heathen Mongols. Abu’l Khair drunk with his string of successes
arrogantly asked them submit to the banner of Islam. In 1457CE Amasanji
launched a surprise attack with 65,000 men against the Blue Horde. Abu’l
Khair seeing them take the towns along the north bank of Syr Darya
marched to meet them. In battle that ensued the Army of Islam led by
Abu’l Khair was smashed to bits upon encirclement by Amasanji. Khan
Abu’l Khair barely escaped with his life. This was the highpoint of the
Oirat Mongol empire which remained a great power till 1490CE. But at
that point a remarkable Chingizid princess, Mandughai, who was seen by
some as a reincarnation of Chingiz Khan’s mother Hoelun, restored
Chingizid power by overthrowing the Oirats in 1491CE. But in the west,
in Kalmykia, the Oirat Mongols still held sway and relentlessly fought
of the Army of Islam inspired by the example of their great leader
Amasanji Taiji. Thus, in 1555CE they retaliated against the entry of
Mohammedan marauders and missionaries into their territory by
comprehensively crushing an triple Islamic alliance of Shaybanids,
Kirghiz and Khazak hordes led by khans like Tawakkul and Nauruz Ahmed.
Thus, to this date their territory remains the only island of the
bauddha-dharma in Russia.

In addition to the survival of heathen traditions, the rise of Oirat
power was also marked by the crystallization of a distinctive Mongol
epic or tuuli known as Jangar. The epic has been preserved primarily as
an oral tradition until it was printed in the last 30 years in Mongolia,
but it is very hard to access these texts. More recently, the Mongol
scholar Chogjin and Mark Bender have provided fragments of this epic in
translation. Since it was a taboo to know the whole epic by heart most
reciters know only a few cantos though some know very many. The full
complexity of this epic is hardly known outside of greater Mongolia and
there might be less than 100 people in these lands alive today who might
know the recitation of even parts. The epic is usually recited to the
accompaniment of the morin huur, tob-shur and pipa (stringed
instruments). The general belief is that Jangar is mythological. A
similar claim has been made for the other Tibeto-Mongol epic, the
gigantic Geser Khan. However, some western scholars have held that the
etymology of Geser being derived from Caesar was a mythologization of
either Julius Caesar or Octavian Augutus. However, more likely, is the
case that there was a historical element inspired by the Khan Su-lu of
the Tuergish Turks with additional elements perhaps drawn from the later
Uighur Khans. Likewise the demons or ogres of the Geser Khan epic might
have some inspiration from the Arabs, like the Meccan demons in Indian
tradition. In the same vein, it is possible that the crystallization of
the Jangar epic might have been influenced by the heroic deeds of Esen
Taiji and Amasanji Taiji. In this regard it might be noted that the
Kirghiz epic Manas was also probably developed upon a historical
foundation of the heathen Kirghiz Khan who conquered the Uighurs to take
over the empire of Mongolia. In more general terms the study of these
Central Asian epics might lend us some understanding of how much
historicity might exist in the Rāmāyaṇa and Mahābhārata.

Canto-1  
In that ancient golden age,  
The time of carrying forth the power of Buddha  
Was born the orphan Jangar,  
At the place called Bomba.

Jangar, a descendant of Tahijolai Khan,  
The grandson of Tangsug Bomba Khan,  
And son of Ujung Aldar Kan.

When Jangar was just two years old,  
An ogre invaded his motherland,  
And Jangar was orphaned,  
Experiencing the bitterness of life.

When Jangar was just three years old,  
The horse Aranjal was only four years old,  
The little warrior perched atop the wonder steed  
Broke apart three great battle formations,  
Conquering the most evil ogre, Goljin.

When Jangar was just four,  
He broke apart four great battle formations,  
causing that yellow monster, Duleidung,  
To give up evil ways for good.

When Jangar was just five years old,  
he capture the five monster of the Tahai region,  
Ensuring that they would never again do evil.

And when he was just five years old,  
He was captured by the wrestler Mongon Sigsirge,  
The orphan becoming a captive of the strongman.

When Jangar was just six years old,  
He destroyed six great battle formations,  
Breaking to bits countless swords and spears,  
Facing down the eminent Altan Qegeji..

Altan Qegeji’s palace  
Was pretty as a picture;  
Under Jangar’s command,  
He took a seat at Jangar’s right hand.

When the orphan Jangar was just seven,  
He conquered seven countries in the east;  
The hero’s name spread in the four directions,  
Known to everyone under the heavens.

When Jangar’s steed Aranjal,  
Speedily galloped along,  
When Jangar’s long golden lance,  
Was sharp beyond compare,  
Jangar displayed his heroism.

In the springtime of his youth,  
He refused the daughters of the 49 surrounding khans in the region;  
From the southeast,  
He chose the daughter of Nomintegus Khan as wife.

The horses raised by Jangar  
Were fast beyond compare;  
Jangar’s conscripts  
Were all warriors beyond compare;  
The lands of the 42 surrounding khans,  
were each enfeoffed to the glorious Jangar.

Jangar’s place, Bomba,  
was a paradise on earth;  
The people there were always young;  
Always looking as if they were youths of 25,  
They never looked old and never died.

In Jangar’s happy land,  
it is always springtime.  
There are now parching droughts,  
There are no bone-chilling cold spells;  
Fresh breezes softly sing,  
Precious mist descends on the hills;  
Flowers blossom everywhere,  
And the grasses flourish.

Jangar’s happy land  
Is vast beyond compare;  
Fast steeds can run for five months,  
Yet still not reach the borders;  
Here the five million blessed subjects  
Can live rich and fulfilling lives.

Elegant peaks, white-capped and loft, touch the skies,  
Shimmering under the golden sun.  
From the great, green lake Sirato Dalai,  
Rivers issue both north and south,  
Rippling day and night like laughter,  
Enlivening the rich verdure.

Jangar drinks the waters of the Huiten River,  
So clear and sweet, bubbling on its way,  
Never stopping, no matter the season.

The master of Bomba,  
Once the orphan Jangar,  
Has supreme power,  
Bringing fortune to his people;  
The hero’s deeds shine among the people,  
The hero’s beautiful name is known everywhere.
