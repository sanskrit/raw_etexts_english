Both vaidIka and mantra-mArga shaiva traditions have similar rituals for
consecration of the warrior and weapons. In the Vedic tradition the main
mantra-s used for this purpose are those from the protective spell of
the bharadvAja-s from the R^igveda (sUkta RV 6.75). This sUkta contains
formulae to consecrate the main implements of proto-Greco-Indo-Iranian
warfare, namely the bow, arrows (including poisoned points), the quiver,
the horses, the reins, whips, chariots, chariot-carrying rathavAhana-s,
armor, and gauntlets. Importantly, the brAhmaNa sprinkled soma on the
warrior with the formula:  
marmANi te varmaNA ChAdayAmi somastvA rAjAmR^itenAnu vastAm |  
urorvarIyo varuNaste kR^iNotu jayantaM tvAnu devAmadantu || (RV
6.75.19)  
In this mantra, after the warrior is armored by the brAhmaNa, soma is
called upon to confer amR^ita (immortality) on the warrior. In addition
to soma, aditi, brahmaNaspati and pUShan were also invoked and made
offerings \[pUShan: Note the link to the Greek Pan; Pan was invoked by
the Greeks in the critical battle of Thermopylae against Iranians. The
roar of Pan is supposed to have been the one which inspired the Greeks
to victory. This military connection of puShan was already forgotten in
the bhArata as suggested by arjuna’s peculiar comment on military
deities.\].

A tAntrIka version of a similar rite is provided by the
raNadIkShAvidhAnaM retro-attributed to bhIShma shAntanava. It belongs to
the larger tradition of the netra tantra as it invokes the primary deity
of this tradition – amR^iteshvara with his famous tAntrIka mantra
(mR^itasaMjIvanI vidyA): OM jUM saH ||. This invocation may be seen as
showing continuity with the much earlier vedic tradition in which soma
is invoked for conferring amR^ita – amR^iteshvara depicted as bearing a
soma/amR^ita pot. In this shaiva rite the warrior/king, after a bath, in
a clean condition first made donations of horses or other items. Then he
invoked vetAla-bhairava and his family devI (which might also indicate a
private manifestation of pratya\~NgirA worshiped in royal households as
in Nepal, Orissa, Gujarat, certain Tamil kingdoms). He applies a tilaka
on the forehead marks his fingers with black ink is sprinkled with
akShata-s mixed with rakta-chandana and is given the raNadIkSha with the
amR^iteshvara mantra and its appropriate nyAsa. He then consecrates the
weapons depicted in the above figure with the respective mantra-s. He
then performs naivedyam with various eats like 36 modaka-s, blood-rice,
and meats to the weapon deities and betel-leaves. Then garlands of the
red karavIra flowers were placed on the necks of the warriors and their
foreheads anointed with vermillion tilaka-s. Then the warriors were
asked to utter the \[five\] “mahA” words to hail the king.

As the shrauta-performing mImAmsaka-s and atharvavedic brahmA ritualists
waned in the context of royal military rituals, the shaiva ritualists of
various mantra-mArga and pAshupata streams started taking up such
performances. The raNa-dIkSha ritual is an example of the parallel
ritual they created along the model of the earlier vedic rituals but
deploying a different set of mantra-s and devatA-s.
