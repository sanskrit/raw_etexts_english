## NOTE

Swami Vivekananda delivered scores of lectures and classes during his
relatively short ministry. Unfortunately the Swami was not always
accompanied by a professional stenographer who could keep pace with the
exceptional speed of his extempore deliveries. However, a few students
managed to take notes of some lectures and classes, which are today the
only available records of works that would otherwise have been lost to
the world.

The original quotation marks of the note-takers have been reproduced.
