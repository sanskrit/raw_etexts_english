In course of their kR^iShi karman my folks encountered a prodigious lime
(or a pair of them). Duly, they interpreted it as a visitation by the
mighty vinAyaka. Given that an old sthala of the gANapatya tAntrika-s
lies about of mile from their dwelling, the visitation was not seen to
be out of
place.[![gan2](https://i1.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2646/4105312742_5dd514f295.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/24766652@N05/4105312742/ "gan2 by somasushma, on Flickr")
