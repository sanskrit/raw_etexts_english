## CLXXXI

*To Sister Christine*

6, PLACE DES ETATS-UNIS

*14th August 1900*

DEAR CHRISTINE,

Your letter from New York reached just now. You must have got mine from
France, directed to 528 Congress.

Well — it was a dreary, funeral-like time. Just think what it is to a
morbid man like me!

I am going to the Exposition, etc., trying to pass time. Had a lecture
here. Père Haycinth \[Hyacinthe\], the celebrated clergy — man here,
seems to like me much. Well, well what? Nothing. Only, you are so good,
and I am a morbid fool — that is all about it. But "Mother" — She knows
best. I have served Her through weal or woe. Thy will be done. Well, I
have news of my lost brother \[Mahendranath Datta\]. He is a great
traveller, that is good. So you see, the cloud is lifting slowly. My
love to your mother and sister and to Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\].

With love,  
VIVEKANANDA
