title = "The quest for faint objects"

+++
In the great expedition of last night the following unusually faint
objects were captured: A galaxy and a planetary nebula.

NGC242 in Cetus. The Nebula occurs just below a group of stars termed
the Phi1 and Phi2 Ceti forming a near equilateral triangle with them.
The object is a very faint shroud that appears to envelop a group of
stars around int in nebulosity. Discovered by Wilhelm Herschel.

IC342 in Cameleopardus is a low brightness galaxy of the Mafei group.
Though it is very close to the Milky Way (about 8.2\*10^6 light years),
it is not at all easy to sight. A group of faint stars from the Milky
way that surround it help one to distinguish the nebulosity.
