title = "A note on the curriculum at takShashila"

+++
ST asked me whether takShashila was a bauddha or Hindu university â€”
ekanetra who has a rather large bookish knowledge of history told her
that takShashila was a buddhist vihAra. To drive home the point to our
inquisitive lady we looked up the jAtaka-s that we periodically visit to
acquaint ourselves with the musical vulgarity of pAli.  
In the susIma jAtaka (\#163) the venerable tathAgata was born as a
brAhmaNa. It is said that he flew to takShashila in a day and learned
the trayi-veda and gAjayurveda in another day. He even corrected his
teacher for wrong readings of the veda. He then returned in a day to
vArANasi and defeated other brahmins who challenged his knowledge.  
In the asadisa jAtaka (\#181) the buddha states that a kShatriya youth
asadisa-kumAra went at the age of 16 to takShashila and studied the
vedas under a renowned professor and also 18 subjects and dhanurveda.  
In the anabhirati jAtaka (\#182) a young brAhmaNa is supposed to have
again gone to takShashila and studied the veda-s, shrauta rituals and
mantra-shAstra under a renowned teacher. He then is said to have
returned to vArANasi and taught the mantra-shAstra to many brAhmaNas and
kShatriyas. However, upon his marriage, given to the ease of married
life he forgot his mantras and he could repeat the veda-s correctly. The
buddha admonished him asked to revive his clarity of mind to recite the
veda-s appropriately.

So by the testimony of the tathAgata himself takShashila was a school of
vedic learning and obviously also of other lore like hastyAyurveda,
dhanurveda and other subjects (18 mentioned by him)
