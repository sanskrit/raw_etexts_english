## LXXVI

*To the Maharaja of Limdi,*

*Cathiawad, Bombay*

CHICAGO

*14th Dec. '95*

YOUR HIGHNESS,

The gentleman whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you was the
chairman of the Parliament of Religions held in Chicago.

He is a holy and noble gentleman. We owe him a deep debt of gratitude;
and as he is going to make a tour through India, I hope your Highness
will extend him the same hospitality as he has to us.

Yours with blessings,

VIVEKANANDA
