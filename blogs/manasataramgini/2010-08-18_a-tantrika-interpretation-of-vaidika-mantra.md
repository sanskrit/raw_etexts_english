title = "A tAntrika interpretation of vaidikaxa0mantra"

+++
Having completed the second circle we mediated up on the might of the
great archer invoking him with the mantra whose R^iShi is haryata the
son pragAtha of the clan of the kANva-s and whose meter is the
gAyatrI:  
antar ichChanti taM jane rudraM paro manIShayA | gR^ibhNanti jihvayA
sasam || RV 8.72.3

antar= within; ichChanti=desire/seek; taM=him; jane= men(locative);
rudraM= rudra; paraH= beyond; manIShayA= mind (instrumental);
gR^ibhNanti = seize; jihvayA = tongue (instrumental); sasam=
plant/grass/grain

The word sasam needs further examination. Typically, it is taken to mean
a grain – a shortened version of the more prevalent form sasya (or
shasya) which means grain. However, we need to examine occurrence of
this word elsewhere in the RV. Based on its occurrence in other places
in the RV it appears that sasa unlike sasya tends to mean plant or grass
or pasture. For example consider the R^ik:  
pra mAtuH prataraM guhyam ichChan kumAro na vIrudhaH sarpad urvIH |  
sasaM na pakvam avidach ChuchantaM ririhvAMsaM ripa upasthe antaH || RV
10.79.3

Here agni is said to be like a kumAra (child) who seeking out his
mothers secret place creeps over the widespread vegetation. Like burning
food he seeks the sasa (i.e. the plants) and licks deep into innards of
the earth. This occurrence supports the sense plant for sasa. But this
R^ik also indicates that sasa is explicitly identified as the food eaten
by agni (i.e. pakvaM)

Hence, we may render the original verse in it is Vedic sense thus:  
Him, rudra, who is beyond conception by thought, they \[i.e. deva-s\]
seek in the midst of men; they seize the plants \[as food\] using him as
the tongue.

To be able to interpret the R^ik in the tAntrika sense need to first
take up its mImAmsaka explanations. Now in the basic literal sense the
sasa (grass) consumed by rudra the could be taken to mean the kusha
grass dipped in ghee that is offered in the fire as the share of rudra.
This is laid out as the final offering in the context of the parvan
sacrifices by the gobhila gR^ihya sUtra of the sAmaveda tradition with
the mantra:  
yaH pashUnAm adhipatI rudras tanticaro vR^iShA, pashUn asmAkaM mA
hiMsIr; etad astu hutaM tava, svAhA || GGS 1.8.28  
Of our cattle you are the lord rudra, the bull roaming near the line
\[to which calves are tied\], do not harm our cattle; this oblation is
for you, hail\!  
But the significance of the verse goes beyond that because it is not
merely alluding to the grass offering to rudra but the fact that he is
the tongue by which the deva-s eat the food which is being offered by
men. To understand the precise significance of this we must turn to the
taittirIya saMhitA 2.6.6 which provides the brAhmaNa regarding the
offering of the sviShTakR^it cakes:

gopIthÁya ||

agni was in the other world, yama in this. The deva said: ‘Come, let us
interchange them’; with food the gods invited agni, with the kingdom the
pitR^i-s \[invited\] yama; therefore is agni the food-eater of the gods,
yama the king of the pitR^i-s; he who knows thus obtains the kingdom and
food. To him \[agni\] they gave that share \[of the puroDAsha cake\],
which they cut off for agni sviShTakR^it. In that he cuts off a share
for agni sviShTakR^it, he offers rudra a share. He cuts off one by one
\[of the two cakes in the offering\], for indeed rudra is one. He cuts
off \[the piece\] from the northern half, for indeed this is rudra’s
direction; verily he pacifies rudra in his own direction. He sprinkles
\[each cake\] twice, to make \[the offering\] partitioned into four. The
fore-part of offerings \[ i.e. pUrva part as against the uttara part
from which the cut for rudra is made\] are cattle, agni is rudra here;
if he were make the oblation with the fore-offerings, he would give the
cattle to rudra. The ritualist would become bereft of cattle. \[Hence,
the ritualist\] offers leaving the fore-offerings aside, to protect the
cattle.

The key points from the above brAhmaNa passage that concern the R^ik of
haryata under discussion are the following:  
1\) agni was in the other world but he was exchanged for yama by the
deva-s and brought to this world. This explains the “jane antar
ichChanti rudraM”, i.e. the deva-s are seek in agni in this world,
amidst men.  
2\) The deva-s do this to make agni their food-eater, i.e. eat the
oblations of men. Hence, this explains the “gR^ibhNanti jihvayA sasam”,
i.e. the use agni as the tongue to eat the ritual fuel, which is their
food. The brAhmaNa adds that the ritualist who performs the rite knowing
this becomes possessed of food.  
3\) Importantly, the brAhmaNa explains that this form of agni, who is
agni sviShTakR^it, is none other than rudra; this explains why in the
R^ik in discussion rudra is referred to. Thus, it is clear agni who
becomes the tongue to provide food for the deva-s. Now this play on sasa
as implying both the vegetable fuel as well as prepared ritual food is
consistent with the offering under discussion. While the direct evidence
for it is not apparent, one could potentially include soma, a plant,
under what is implied by sasa.

One phrase that remains is the term “paro manIShayA”, i.e. beyond the
means of the mind”. This is an importantcommon link to the shrauta and
tAntrika explanations of the mantra. We interpret it that rudra is
beyond mental conceptualization – he has to be directly consciously
experienced in first person. This experience is the one which both the
shrauta ritual and the tAntrika sAdhana produce.

Turning to the tAntrika explanation we have to first note that the
cognates of vaidika ritual are internalized within the human body. Hence
the “jane antar ichChanti rudraM” is literally inside the body of the
man. It is here that the deva-s are stationed. In this regard we might
examine the opinion of the great tAntrika abhinavagupta (tantrAloka
12.6-7; let me repeat it here):  
evaM vishvAdhva saMpUrNaM kAla-vyApAra-chitritaM |  
desha-kAla-maya-spanda-sadma dehaM vilokayet |  
tathA vilokyamAno .asau vishvAntar devatA-mayaH |  
dhyeyaH pUjyashcha tarpyashcha tadAviShTo vimuchyate | (tantrAloka
12.6-7)

Thus, the body is perceived as full of diverse pathways, marked by
time-dependent processes (lit. temporal processes), and as the seat of
vibrations in space and time. The \[body\] perceived thus is composed of
all devatA-s and meditated, worshiped and pacified \[quenched with
offerings\]. He who enters that \[the body\] is liberated.

Thus, the kaula vision can be interpreted as implying that all devatA-s
are stationed within are are receiving their worship and importantly the
quenching offerings right within the body itself. Hence, in the tAntrika
interpretation of this mantra the deva-s are experienced within the body
itself, with all its physiological processes, receiving their oblations.
To move further with tAntrika interpretation let us examine the kaula
practice of manthana as described by abhinavagupta by which the great
energy arises which manifests as the three shakti-s of the trika
tantra-s. The point of note is the initiation of this dhyAna laid out in
the 5th chapter of the tantrAloka (5.22-23):  
soma-sUryaagni-saMghaTTaM tatra dhyAyed ananyadhIH |  
tad dhyAnaaraNi-saMkShobhAn-mahAbhairava-havyabhuk ||  
hR^idayAkhye mahAkuNDe jAjvalan sphItatAM vrajet |  
tasya shaktimataH sphIta shakter bhairava-tejasaH || (tantrAloka
5.22-23)

With an undistracted mind he meditates on the rubbing together of soma,
sUrya and agni. By the friction of such a fire-drill \[the sAdhaka\]
becomes the eater of the oblation of mAhAbhairava in the great
fire-altar in the form of the heart, blazing brightly, attains success.
This success of his, possessed of mighty energy is the bhairava luster.

Thus, in the kaula meditation of the churning of the fire-drill of soma,
sUrya and agni the heart is the ritual fire where in the sAdhaka
identified with mahAbhairava consumes his oblation. This provides the
link to the rudra within men who is the consumer of oblations in the
R^ik.

The reference to the tongue immediately reminds one of the famous yogic
practice incorporated into the kaula system, namely the khecharI mudra.
To understand the connection the mantra under discussion we shall first
see how the tongue is seen as the means of consuming the food/elixir of
the deva-s. This is made rather clear in the yoga compendium of the
medieval yogin svAtmArama in his haThayoga pradIpika:

gomAMsaM bhakShayen nityaM pibed amara-vAruNIm |  
kulInaM tam ahaM manye cetare kula-ghAtakAH ||  
go-shabdenoditA jihvA tat pravesho hi tAluni |  
go-mAMsa-bhakShaNaM tat tu mahA-pAtaka-nAshanam ||  
jihvA-pravesha-sambhUta-vahninotpAditaH khalu |  
candrAt sravati yaH sAraH sA syAd amara-vAruNI || HYP 3.47-49

He should constantly eat the meat of the cow and drink the beer of the
immortals. I consider him to be a Kaula, while the others are destroyers
of the kula. By the word cow the tongue is meant, which is inserted
above the palate. Hence indeed the eating of beef destroys great sins.
The tongue’s insertion generates the fire verily \[causes\] the juice to
flows from the moon, which is the beer of the gods.

The points to note here are :1) the implicit identification of the
tongue with the fire and 2) that the tongue is used to feed on the
elixir of the deva-s that is allegorically referred to as beer. To see
the connection between the khecharI practice and rudra we must turn to
the khecharI-vidyA, a tantra of the kaula stream. This tantra repeatedly
informs us the practice of khecharI results in the identification of
oneself with shiva (KhV 2.7, 2.8, 2.12, 2.29). In the highest stage of
khecharI practice one performs the great meditation of the five-fold
shiva in the center of the brain, the hypothalamus, known to the
tAntrika-s as the vajrakanda. The description of this meditation is
rather complex and we shall lay it out as its described in the khV:

ataH paraM pravakShyAmi parAmR^ita mahApadam |  
vajrakandaM lalATe tu prajvalach chandra saMnibham ||  
Now I shall teach regarding the great state of the ultimate ambrosia.
The “diamond bulb” i.e. the hypothalamus in the forehead shines like the
moon.
