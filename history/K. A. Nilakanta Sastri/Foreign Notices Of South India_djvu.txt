PREFACE 


This is a source-book of Early South Indian History. Its aim 
is to present in a handy form the numerous Foreign Notices of 
South India including Ceylon scattered in several books and 
journals published by learned Societies not easily accessible to the 
general reader. In some cases the passages selected for inclusion 
have been specially rendered into English from French translations 
of Arabic or Chinese originals. 

The sources included here comprise mainly Greek and Latin, 
Arabic, Chinese and Persian authors ; but not being acquainted 
with their several languages, I have based this work altogether 
upon translations into modern European languages. Though the 
collection is not exhaustive, I believe nothing of importance has 
been omitted. The reasons for the choice of the extracts and their 
importance to students of South Indian History are briefly explain- 
ed in the Introduction and notes, and will, I trust, be borne out by 
the extracts themselves. 

I acknowledge with great pleasure the assistance of 
Dr. N. Venkataramanayya, who gave me the transliteration of 
proper names occurring in Ibn Battuta and also some of the notes 
to the same author ; and of Miss K. M. Sowmini, who made some 
of the translations from French and checked the references to 
French periodicals. 

Excepting Ibn Battuta, I have generally retained the forms of 
proper names as they appear in the authorities I have used. 

For permission to include extracts I am indebted to M. Paul 
Pelliot, Directeur, Toung Pao, for Nos. II, IX, XI, XVI, XXIV, 
XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV A-B ; to Archibald R. Maclean, Esq., 
for Nos. Ill, IV, VI and XII A i to iii, B and C, and to the High Com- 
missioner for India, London, for procuring this permission ; to the 
Director, Philadelphia Commercial Museum, for V and VII; to the 
Clarendon Press, Oxford, for Nos. VIII and XV B-D ; to the 
General Secretary, Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta, 
for X, XIII and Appendix IV; to the Secretary, Royal Asiatic 
Society, London, for XIV, XXXIV C-D ; to the Librarian, 
Societe Asiatique, Paris, for XV A, XVIII, XXX A-RR, C-ii, 
Appendix i, ii and iii ; to Secretaire General, Libraire Ernest 
Leroux, Paris, for XV E; to the Directeur, R.E.F.E.O., Hanoi, for

INTRODUCTION 


£ The more we learn the further goes back the history of Eastern 

Navigation./ 

—Yule. 

* L’histoire de l’lnde, trop exclusivement regardee du continent, doit 
etre aussi envisagee au point du vue maritime/ 

— Sylvain Levi. 

The Indian Ocean is not a closed basin like the Mediterranean 
Sea ; on the South it opens on an infinite expanse of 

water. Yet the prevalence of currents and of 
the Indian periodical winds conducive to navigation has 

ocean maintained here, since very early times, a system 

of exchanges in which the African coast, 
Arabia, the Persian Gulf, India, Insulindia, Indo-China, and 
beyond it, China and even Korea and Japan, continually gave 
and received their quotas. And in this system, India held 
a privileged, if not a preponderant, place by the advant- 
age of her situation and the great length of her coasts ; 

she is the centre towards which the many lines of this 
system converge. Doubtless, the documents are rare for the 
ancient period ; but the race which carried civilisation by the sea 
to Burma, to Siam, to Cambodia, Indo-China and Java, and Mada- 
gascar, was a race of navigators. 

And though as a whole Southern India ‘ has in the past looked 
east rather than west/ still the mariners of Surparaka, Bharukaccha 
and Muziris are famous in history and legend. 
* folklore * In his celebrated study on the Ramayana , 1 * 
Sylvain Levi draws pointed attention to many 

similarities between the geographical cantos in the fourth 
book of the Ramayana and the statements of Arab geographers, 
and argues that these similarities suggest the existence of £ a folk- 
lore of the Indian ocean , 5 stories current among mariners of the 
‘distant countries to which either their voluntary sailings or the 
freaks of winds had carried them . 5 “ And from Africa to China,” 
he says, “ on this immense extent of coasts which recede in deep 
hollows or project in compact masses, the same narratives recur,

ever re-examined and ever guaranteed by fresh proofs. Each self- 
respecting navigator must have seen the sacred marvels with his 
own eyes. From the Periplus of Scylax to the voyages of Sindbad 
the Sailor, the same stories pass from collection to collection, as 
they pass from mouth to mouth”. And the testimony of Al-Biruni 
is clear on the existence, in his day, of an active intercourse of 
ancient standing between Africa and China, and of the part of 
India in it ; for he says : 2 “ The reason why in particular Somnath 
I has become so famous is that it was a harbour for sea-faring people, 
land a station for those who went to and fro between Sufala in the 
| jcountry of Zanj (Africa) and China. ” 

On the landward side again India was in equally active com- 
munication with China. The route taken by Fa-hien and Yuan 
Chwang into India was followed by many others, 
and trade was at least as good an incentive to this 
intercourse as religion ; I-tsing has preserved a re- 
cord of sixty of his contemporaries who visited 
India for religious study, but we have no account of the mercantile 
intercourse of the same period. But as Garrez has shown, 3 even 
for the Persians of the Sassanian period, Bactriana, the cradle of 
the religion of Zoroaster, had become virtually an Indian country 
and the Oxus a river of the Buddhists and Brahmins. “ For 
nearly eight centuries in effect (125 B.C. to 650 A.D.), Bactriana 
was occupied by the Kusans, who also extended their sway over 
the entire valley of the Kabul and that of the Indus up to the 
peninsula of Guzerat. Connected thus politically with the land of 
Indians, separated on the other hand from Iran proper by a desert, 
it fell gradually under Indian influence, and the ancient religion 
nf the Mim had to give place to the Brahmins, and above all to 
the Buddhists. The Greek writers of this period always cite 
Bactriana with India, and mention thousands of Brahmanas and 
Samanas who reside there. Already the medals of many Greek 
kings of this country bear legends in an Indian language and 
character. Those of Indo-Scythians show us still, it is true, some 
names of Iranian divinities ; but the figures on them are accom- 
panied by Indian attributes, some even being oddly made up with 
that superfluity of heads and arms which characterises so specially 
the representation of divinity in the land of the Hindus. The 
Chinese annalists, who have conserved to us precious data regard-

ing these Scythian princes, describe them as zealous Buddhists; 
this is beyond all possibility of doubt for many among them, 
notably for the celebrated Kanerki or Kaniska. It is during this 
period that the Iranian name of Balhi entered Sanskrit literature, 
and that the Oxus, under its primitive name of which we find no 
trace in Iran, took a place in the Indian cosmography of the 
Brahmans as well as the Buddhists”. Sylvain Levi has pointed 
out that the Ramayana mentions the Tarim under the name of 
Sxta, while traditional Buddhist cosmography makes this stream, 
as well as the Indus, the Oxus and the Ganges, rise from one and 
the same lake Anavatapta. 4 5 

In the days when Yuan Chwang traversed Bactriana, “ Bud- 
dhism was generally flourishing from Termez, at the passage of 
the Oxus, up to Barman at the gates of Kabul, 
and in the south-west up to Ta-la-kien on serindia 
the frontier of the kingdom of Po~lcisse (Persia). 

The country of Balkh alone contained nearly one hundred 
convents and 53,000 monks. One of the convents, the most remark- 
able for its magnificence, situated to the south-west of the town, 
was known by the name * New Convent 5 (nava sanghdrdma or 
nava vihdra) 5 This ‘ new convent ’ ( Nubehar ) was destroyed by 
Islamic forces within half-a-century after Yuan Chwang visited it, 
and Buddhism suffered in Central Asia the same fate which befell 
it in India some centuries later. And for many centuries after the 
land routes across the North-Western frontier of India ceased to 
be frequented by merchants and pilgrims from China, the sea-route 
between India and China was open, and there is much evidence 
available on these latter-day commercial relations. 

Besides these contacts with Africa, Arabia and China, India, 
and Southern India in particular, had in the early centuries of the 
Christian era, a regular system of exchanges, direct and indirect, 
with the Eastern section of the Roman Empire. 

Our aim is to see what impression Southern India (including 
Ceylon) made upon the foreigners who came into contact with 
it one way or another. The earliest accounts we 
have are, speaking generally, those of ■ the sources 
classical writers, whose notices of India' gain 
in extent and accuracy to the end of the second century A.D.

Then, come several notices from Chinese travellers and annalists 
many of which have been made accessible only by researches that 
are still in progress. From the eighth century the writings of Aran 
merchants and travellers, historians and geographers begin to be 
important, while the Chinese sources become more copious and I 

definite than before. We have also occasional notices by European 
travellers (and priests) like Benjamin of Tudela and Marco Polo. 

After the end of the fourteenth century, the foreign notices of ^ 

Southern India become too many and too voluminous for inclusion 
in this collection, and an exception has been made in favour of 
only a very few highly significant accounts. 



Among the classical writers directly accessible at present the 
earliest to mention India is Herodotus. Writing in the fifth century 
B.C., the Father of History had only a vague 
classical and meagre knowledge of the country and his 

writers notice of it is valuable for his curious account of cer- 

tain wild trees that bore wool which in beauty and 
quality excelled that of sheep and out of which the Indians made 
their clothing. 6 . His is the first rational account of India and its 
peoples, generally free from the fables described by other writers 
both before and after him. The first direct notice of a South 
Indian kingdom occurs in Megasthenes whose quaint account of 
the Pandyan Kingdom seems to be a mixture of facts and of 
contemporary fables relating to that Kingdom. (I B, i and ii) . 


One of the most surprising results of recent research is the 
discovery by Paul Pelliot of a passage (II) in Pan Kou, a very 
early Chinese writer, attesting the existence of

states of Insulindia and Southern India in the Han 
period, beginning from the second century B.C.

warrant a somewhat drastic revision of the notions now held 


regarding the age when the Hindu colonisation of the eastern lands 


began. €a

immense wealth in part from its “ share in the trade of the East 
which had by now assumed very large proportions 

thanks to direct contact with India Ptolemaic Hellenistic 

merchant fleets were sent to the southern ports of age 

the Red Sea/’ 7 by the Nile-Red-Sea canal 

which had been opened in 190 R.C., and the Arabs and the Hindus 

served as intermediaries for the trade with India and the Far 

East till Roman times. 

The Andhras are the earliest Indian line of kings definitely 
known to have developed a sea power and to have promoted 
maritime trade and also perhaps overseas colonisation. The attribute 
trisamudmdhipati, lord of the three oceans, is applied to them by 
Sana in his Harsacarita, and there is mention in the Apocrypha of 
an Andrapolis as a port in Western India ; lastly, numerous coins 
of this dynasty are known to bear the design of a double-masted 
ship figured on them. 8 

“The policy of the Roman Empire during the two centuries 
following the Christian era was to encourage direct sea trade with 
India, cutting out all overland routes through 
Parthia and thus avoiding the annoyance of fiscal roman empire 
dependence on that consistent enemy of Rome”. 9 
Strabo records the increase in the knowledge of India 
among the Romans of his day and the success of the ex- 
pedition under Gallus, sent by Augustus (25 B.C.) to secure for 
the empire the command of Aden and the Red Sea route to India, 
which was becoming increasingly popular among the merchants 
of the empire, (III C) . Aden was soon after occupied by a colony 
of Egyptians and Greeks, and the monsoon was discovered for the 
Romans by Hippalus, an Egyptian pilot. This discovery not only 
shortened the duration of the journey, but, by enabling ships to 
cut across the open sea, greatly diminished the danger from pirates 
who infested the coastal waters. “ We are told that whereas before

this discovery hardly twenty ships a year had made the voyage, 
after it, on an average, a ship a day left the Egyptian ports for the 
East. To the sailors of these ships the whole of the western coast 
of India was well known .” 10 It is noteworthy that more than one 
half of the Roman coins found in India date from the time of 
Augustus and Tiberius. Before the first century A.D. was far 
advanced, the Indian trade attained such magnitude as to give 
concern to thoughtful observers. 

u Besides cloves and other products of Malaya and silk from 
China, the ports on the West coast of India furnished pepper, ivory 
of the elephants of Malabar, indigo, steel, muslins, ebony, pearls 
from Cape Comorin, and teak-wood which was employed in car- 
pentry on the coasts of the Persian Gulf where in general teak did 
not grow. Lastly the Coromandel coast supplied cotton stuffs. In 
their turn the Roman ships brought wine, Egyptian fabrics, coral, 
a rare article in all the Eastern countries, tin, lead and bronze.

and has been questioned by Barnett— (Journal of Egyptian Archaeology ,

Boii *a present of some Indians who were said to have been cast upon the 
German coast/ Lassen (Ind, Alter, iii, pp. 57-8) who was the first, I think, 
to discuss these references was inclined to discount the possibility of the 
Indians having rounded the whole of Africa and Western Europe at such an 
early date, and to suggest a shipwreck in the Caspian Sea. Others have 
suggested that these were American Indians who had drifted across the 
Atlantic Ocean, or even that they were merely Europeans. Some Indian 
scholars are convinced that it is a case of circumnavigation of Africa.

As the articles brought by the Romans did not suffice to pay for 
what they purchased, the difference was paid in cash”. 11 

Pliny the Elder, the anonymous author of the Periplus of the 
Erythraean Sea, and Ptolemy, represent the further stages in that 
increasing acquaintance of the Romans with the 
countries of the East of which we get the first puny 
hints in Strabo. Though Pliny generally derives 
his information regarding India from earlier writers, still his refer- 
ences to Indian trade (IV B) and the drain of Roman treasure due to 
it must have been quite up to date when he wrote 
his Natural History about 75 A.D. Whether the PERIPLUS 0F THE 

•n . 1 , n IP Pi ERYTHRAEAN 

Periplus was written a rew years before or alter gEA 
the publication of Pliny’s work, its author had 
doubtless visited the seats of commerce on the West coast of India, 
and his account is invaluable for the directness and accuracy that 
generally characterise it (V) . 

The voyages of Greek sailors were continued beyond Cape 
Comorin from about the close of the first century A.D., and in the 
early decades of the second century they explored 
many sea-routes across the Bay of Bengal, exploration 
“ One pioneer appropriately named Alexander 
cut across the Isthmus of Malaya and skirted the Annamese 
coast as far as Cattigara (probably Hanoi in Tonkin) * 
Finally, in 166 a deputation of Greek merchants, who styled them- 
selves ‘ ambassadors ’ from the emperor 4 An-Tun ’ (M. Aurelius 
Antoninus) visited the court of the Emperor Huan-ti at Loyang and 
opened negotiations for a regular overseas trade between the 
Mediterranean lands and China”. 12 But these voyages were occa- 
sional ventures that led to no extensive changes in the trade con- 
nections of the Roman Empire. Yet the improvement effected 
in the knowledge relating to the geography of the East is reflect- 
ed in Ptolemy’s pages. Pliny and Periplus knew nothing of the 
Far East ; the merchants who frequented Barygaza and Muziris in 
their time knew little of the Eastern navigation beyond India, and' 
they were still enquiring if Taprobane was an island or a continent 
communicating with Africa. 13 On the other hand, coins of Trajan 
(98-117 A.D.) and Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) are not uncommon on

the East coast of South India, though comparatively rare on the 
West coast. And though “ his map of India has been distorted out 
of recognition by a portentous error/’ Ptolemy “made important 
additions to the knowledge of the geography of Ceylon, the interior 
of India, and India beyond the Ganges ”. 14 And after Ptolemy, as 
Sylvain Levi has shown, all texts Greek and Indian relate them- 
selves to him and to the Niddesa. It has been rightly observed that 
Ptolemy’s Guide to Geography € differed from Strabo’s production 
as does a skeleton from the living body ’; 15 for this reason and 
because of the numerous and difficult problems of identification 
presented by his tables relating to Southern India, problems which 
cannot be adequately treated in casual notes, I decided to omit the 
tables from the present collection. 

After Ptolemy’s attempt 4 to put into scientific form the records 
and personal impressions of a number of merchants, travellers and 
others of his time/ there ‘ followed a long period 
marciaw or without original observation or authorship — a 
heraclea period of copying, compilation and imitation ’. 16 

The Roman empire began to develop signs of weak- 
ness and the delicate commercial system which had been reared 
during the Hellenistic and early Imperial periods broke down com- 
pletely towards the end of the third century. The Greek half of 
the Roman empire indeed kept up its political unity much longer 
than the Western half ; but ‘ knowledge and enterprise were 
languishing and were not revived until the conquests of the 
followers of Mohammed again brought East and West into contact 
and orderly relations ’ . 17 To this period belongs Marcian 
of Heraclea (VII) whose work has survived only in frag- 
ments. “If it had been preserved to us in complete form”, says 
Schoff , 18 “ it might indeed have been a more useful compilation 
of Roman geography for general reference than the highly tech- 
nical work of Ptolemy.” 

A more typical Byzantine figure was the ‘ crotchety monk * 
Cosmas, called Indikopleustes * the man who sailed to India ’. In 
his early life he was a merchant, and his business 
cosmas took him to many places on the Persian Gulf,

India’s relations with China form a long and instructive story. 
But I must in general confine my attention to South India and 
Ceylon and the sea-route to China ; an occasional 
china glance at the relations between China and 

the maritime states of the Malay peninsula 
along that route will also be useful to our understanding 
of the subject. The beginnings of this intercourse may be traced, 
as has been seen, to the second century B.C. or even earlier. The 
evidence for the first and second centuries A.D. is meagre. Yet 
there is no room to doubt that the political condition of India and 
the extensive trade relations maintained by the various parts of 
that country were well known in China. This becomes clear from 
an interesting passage in the report made to the emperor in 125 
A.D. by general Pan Yong, the son of the cele- 
pan yong brated Pan Tch'ao and nephew of the historian 

Pan Kou. Pan Yong played an important part 
in the conquest and administration of the Western parts 
of the Chinese Empire in the first years of the second century 
A.D., and his account of India, remarkable alike for its brevity and 
precision, deserves to be reproduced here 20 : 

“ The kingdom of Tien-tchou (India) is also known as Chen - 
ton ; it lies several thousands of Ii to the south-east of Hiong-nou. 
Its customs are similar to those of Hiong-nou, but the country is 
low, humid and warm. This kingdom is on the banks of a great 
river. The people ride on elephants while going to war ; they are 
weaker than the Yue-tche ; they practise the religion of the 
Buddha ; and it has become a habit with them never to kill or to 
fight. ■ 

£< K after leaving the kingdom of Kao-fou (Kabul) which be- 
longs to the Yue-tche, one goes south-west, one reaches the western 
sea ; in the East one gets to the kingdom of P’an~k e i ; 21 all these 

Pulakesin, the Paramesvara of the South. Noldeke says that if Fergusson’s 
date for the paintings is correct, his interpretation of them can hardly be 
impugned (op. cit, p. 503). Foucher’s view is that no historical scenes 
were represented anywhere in Ajanta, Journal of the Hyderabad Archaeo- 
logical Society , 1919-20, pp. 99-100. R. C. Majumdar relates Tabarfs

lands form part of Chen-tou. Chen-tou contains several hundreds 
of towns other (than the capital) ; in each town they have 
appointed a governor ; there are many dozens of other 
kingdoms (besides the principal one) ; in each kingdom 

there is a king. Though some small differences may be noticed in 
each of these kingdoms, yet all are called Chen-tou, At this period 
(apparently 125 A.D.) they are dependent altogether on the Yue- 
tche ; the Yue-tche having killed the king and installed a chief 
as governor of these people. 

“ This country produces elephants, rhinoceroses, tortoise shell, 
gold, silver, copper, iron, lead (and) tin. From the West coast it 
is in communication with Ta-TsHn (the Roman province of Syria) , 22 
and precious objects from Ta-Ts c in are found there. There are also 
fine fabrics, woollen carpets of good quality, perfumes of all kinds, 
sugar-candy, pepper, ginger (and) black salt. 

u In the epoch of the emperor Ho (89-105 AD.) , they sent on 
several occasions ambassadors carrying tribute and presents. Later, 
the countries of the West having revolted, these relations were 
interrupted. Then in the reign of emperor Houan, in the second 
(159 AD.) and fourth (161 AD.) years Yen-hi they came again 
on two occasions from beyond J e-nan ”. 23 The Hindu embassies of 
159 and 161 thus followed the same route as the so-called 4 embassy 5 
from Marcus Aurelius which reached China in 166 AD. 24 and 
brought with them ivory, rhinoceros horns and tortoise shells. 

According to a Chinese authority cited by Sylvain Levi, 25 there 
was another and a longer break in the relations between China and 
India in the third century. But it may be 
doubted if this statement refers to the Southern sea-route 
sea-route between China and India. At any 
rate there is much evidence to show that Southern India was in

was tempted to enter into communication by sea with China, because the silk 
trade by land was interrupted owing to the campaigns of A vidus Cassius 
against the Parthians and of the plague that followed. But on the one 
hand, it seems that the person who represented himself as the ambassador 
of Marcus Aurelius was a simple merchant with no official character; and 
on the other that, as we shall see, musicians and jugglers from Ta Ts’m 
arrived in Burma as early as 120 A.D., which shows that the relations by 
sea between the Eastern part of the Roman Empire and the Far East did 
not wait to establish themselves till the reign of Marcus Aurelius ” —

active touch with the colonies of Indonesia and that these colonies 
often employed South Indian products in their exchanges with 
China, 

In 225 A.D. Fu-nan (Ancient Cambodia) and other countries 
offered the lieou-li (pkt. verulya, skt. vaidurya) , the cafs-eye gem, 
as a present ; this gem must have been of South Indian origin. 20 
About the same time, the king of Fu-nan sent an embassy to India ; 
this embassy went up the river Ganges and reached the court of 
the Murunda king and returned to Fu-nan at the end of four years 
with a present of four horses of the country of the Yue-che (Indo- 
Scythians) . 27 Other embassies from Fu-nan to China are 
recorded in the years, 225-30, 243, 268, 285, 286, 287, 

357, 434, 435, 438, and 484 bringing presents of “ an image 
in chased gold of the seat of the king of dragons, an elephant 
in white sandal, two stupas of ivory, two pieces of cotton, two sou~U 
( surahi ) of glass, and one tray of areca-nut and tortoise shell. 55 ' 
Again in 503, 511, 514, 519, embassies brought as presents a lucky 
image of sandalwood from India and the leaves of the sola tree, 
besides pearls, rock crystal, turmeric, and storax and other per- 
fumes. Later embassies offered a live rhinoceros among other 
things. 28 It is easily seen that vaidurya, sandalwood and pearls are 
specifically South Indian products. 

The kingdom of Campa (Ancient Cochin-China) also sent 
embassies in the years 230, 268, 284 and 340 offering tame elephants 
and carrying a letter * written entirely in barbaric characters/ i.e., 
an Indian alphabet prevalent in Campa, and it is well-known that 
this alphabet was of South Indian origin. 29 

It has been shown that asbestos was shipped from India to 
Fu-nan in the beginning of the third century A.D. 30 From Java

stuffs, coarse and fine, from India, and cotton goods from Ye-po 
(Gandhara, according to Pelliot) . 31 

Facts like these show that the sea-route between India and 
China was being actively used during the early centuries of 
the Christian era, if not directly at least by the 
mediation of the Hindu colonies of Indonesia, fa-hie n 
This inference is confirmed by the story of 
Fa-hien’s travels at the beginning of the fifth century. He is 
indeed the first Buddhist who is known to have succeeded in 
accomplishing a sea journey from Ceylon to China. He did not 
visit the mainland of South India but took ship from Tamluk to 
Ceylon, (VIII B, C), and his interest was centred chiefly in 
Buddhism. His account of the Deccan and the 4 pigeon monastery ’ 
is just edifying gossip (VIII- A). 

It may be noted that in this early period the sea-trade between 
China and the Western countries was developed by the initiative 
and enterprise of the Arabs and Indians. The Chinese were still 
timid navigators and much afraid of pirates. 32 

After Fa-hien there was a succession of Buddhists who sailed 
between Southern India and China. Sanghavarmi, a Ceylonese 
monk, arrived in China in 420 A.D. and translated 
the Mahisasaka Vinaya. The more celebrated gunavarman 
Gunavarman arrived soon after. The stories 
that have gathered round his name may not all be history ; 
but there is little reason to doubt that Javanese Buddhism 
owed a great deal to him, and that, in China, he helped to establish 
a community of nuns, a project which involved the invitation of 
some nuns from Ceylon to come and assist in the initiation of the 
order. Gunavarman also translated many sacred books into the 
Chinese language (IX) . The names of several others who follow- 
ed the sea-route in the fifth century are mentioned in the Kwai- 
Yuen catalogue of the Chinese Tripitaka, compiled in 730 A.D. 33 

The maritime intercourse between the two countries seems to 
have continued in full swing in the sixth and seventh centuries 
A.D. Cosmas mentions the arrival in Ceylon of SIXTH AND 
ships from the remotest countries including seventh 
those that brought silk from Tsinista (China) , centuries

and his testimony is that of a merchant who had taken 
a personal part in trading with Ceylon in the sixth century* Later 
Chinese authors like Cho'u K‘iu-fel (1178) and Chau Ju-kua (1225) 
record it as their opinion that though Kia Tan (730-835 A.D.) , the 
great Chinese geographer, described a land-route from Annam to 
India, still the sea-route must have been more expeditious than the 
long overland route, because the celebrated Bodhidharma sailed all 
the way to Canton about 520 A.D . 34 Ma-Twan-lin has preserved an 
account of a South Indian embassy to China (X) at the beginning 
of the sixth century A.D. which took some horses of a fine breed as 
presents to the Chinese Emperor and gave much interesting 
information on the products of the country. The role of Fu-nan as 
intermediary in the trade relations between South India and China 
becomes apparent in a curious account (XI) of a highly valued 
mirror from Western India offered for sale in China sometime be- 
tween 500 and 550 A.D. To Ma Twan-iin again we owe the survi- 
val of a short and rather vague passage (XIII) which refers to 
conditions prevailing in India, maybe in the second half of the 
sixth century or in an earlier period ; it says that some Indians 
went as far as Fu-nan and Tonkin to traffic in coral necklaces 
and pearls of inferior quality, and then proceeds to give a brief 
sketch of the Indians, their habits and dress. 

The seventh century forms a great epoch in the annals of 
Indian Buddhism and the attractions offered by its study in situ 
to many pious Chinese pilgrims. Some Indian monks also travel- 
led to China to labour there in the cause of 
bharmagupta the Buddhist faith. Dharmagupta, for instance, 
a scholar of Lata (Gujerat), left his native

of India. Not only did he travel much more extensively in India 
than his compatriots, but he was on the whole much less of a 
recluse than they. Like them, he was primarily interested in the 
study and collection of Buddhist, sacred books and in visiting the 
far-famed shrines of India, but as Watters has said * his creed was 
broad and his piety never became ascetic, 'and he was by nature 
tolerant.’ The record of his journeys and experiences is as varied 
and interesting as may be expected, and, except in recording Bud- 
dhist miracles, he generally depended on the testimony of his own 
personal observation (XIV). Even so, he does not completely 
satisfy the curiosity of modem students, and to cite Watters once 
more : * He was not a good observer, a careful investigator, or a 
satisfactory recorder, and consequently he left very much untold 
which he would have done well to tell.’ 

By the side of Yuan Chwang, I-tsing appears more bookish. 
I-tsing 36 was a boy of twelve when Yuan Chwang returned to 
China in 645 A.D., and his biographer informs 
us that I-tsing made up his mind to follow i-tsing 
Yuan Chwang’s illustrious example in the year 
649. For reasons unknown to us, he had to put off the exe- 
cution of his plan till 671 when he embarked from Canton on a 
Persian ship ; many other monks had promised to accompany him, 
but stayed away in the end, and his only companion was his pupil 
Chan-hing. He reached India early in 673 and landed at Taxnluk. 
He spent three months there and made the acquaintance of a China- 
man who had already lived twelve years in India. In his company 
he visited Bihar, the true Holy Land of Buddhism, travelling with 
a caravan of hundreds of merchants. He fell ill on the way, and 
later became a victim to a band of robbers who relieved him of 
all possessions, including his clothes. He rejoined his companions 
later and finished his pilgrimage without any further adventures. 
He then spent ten years in Nalanda till in 685 he made up his mind 
to return to China by the same route as he had taken on his out- 
ward journey. He spent four years at Srivijaya, went to Canton 
for a short period, and returned to Srivijaya with four companions 
to carry on his literary work. His memoirs were written when he 
lived in Srivijaya. He returned to China in 695 and was received 
with great pomp by the notorious empress Ou. He kept himself 
busy with his literary work till his death in 713. 37

I-tsing thus did not visit Southern India or even Ceylon, and he 
has therefore nothing to tell us directly about these lands. But his 
works are valuable for the itineraries they contain (XV- A), for 
their notices of differences in doctrines and social practices among 
the Buddhists of different lands (XV-B, C, D) , and above all for 
the brief biographies of eminent monks who visited India in his 
time (XV-E) . For, as Chavannes has observed, it is surprising 
to find that in one generation as many as sixty persons braved the 
hazards of this distant and perilous voyage. And it is legitimate to 
suppose that in the periods before and after I-tsing hundreds of 
pilgrims must have undertaken similar voyages the details of which 
have altogether escaped the historian. 

That religion was not the sole motive force that brought China 
and India together in this period, that trade and politics also 
worked towards the same result, becomes clear 
trade and from the notices of certain embassies from the 

politics kingdoms of India 3711 including the Pallava 

kingdom of Kahci in the last years of the seventh 
century and the first years of the eighth (XVI) . These 
notices have been collected from a Chinese encyclopaedia of 
the eleventh century by Chavannes, and are also preserved in a 
later abbreviated version in the pages of the indefatigable Ma- 
Twan-lin. These embassies have not received the attention they 
deserve at the hands of Indian historians. Siladitya of Western 
India, 33 and the Calukya Vallabha of South India, sent their repre- 
sentatives to China in 692. But the most surprising fact we learn 
from these records is that in 720 A.D. Narasimhavarman II, the 
Pallava ruler of Kanci, well-known under his surname Rajasimha, 
sent an embassy to China to inform the Chinese emperor of his in- 
tention to go to war with the Arabs and Tibetans and asked the Em- 
peror to give a name to his army ; he also sent word that he had 
constructed a temple on account of the emperor and wanted him 
to give it too a name. The ambassador that brought these requests 
was highly honoured, and a Chinese embassy was sent in return 
to visit South India and gratify the wishes of Narasimhavarman.

These precise references to Narasimhavarman go to show that 
the -usual chronology of the reigns of the Pallava monarchs at the 
close of the seventh century and the beginning of 
the eighth is not as well founded as it is generally pallavas 
taken to be ; it is possible that the reign of and china 
Narasimhavarman lasted longer and that of Nandi- 
varman II Pallavamalla began later than is generally believed. 39 
The mention of Arabs and Tibetans as the enemies of the Pallava 
kingdom in this period should also be noted. Separately or 
allied together, the Arabs and the Tibetans were more the enemies 
of China in this period than of any Indian state, 
least of all a South Indian state, and one tibetan power 
may reasonably surmise that it was the 
Chinese court which, being impressed by the political power 
of Narasimhavarman in India, was anxious to enlist his support in 
its plans against the Tibetans. “ It is certain, according to the 
evidence of certain Chinese authors,” says Reinaud, “that the 
Tibetans, called Thufan by those writers, played in the seventh 
and eighth centuries A.D. a great part in Central Asia. Masters 
for a time of regions situated in the north-east and south-east, they 
made the emperors of China tremble even in their capital. A 
Chinese author says that, at an epoch which corresponds to the 
year 787, the emperor of China found himself constrained, for his 
own security, to make an alliance with the king of Yunnan, the 
Khalif of Bagdad, and certain Indian princes. The Tibetan arms 
seemed to extend to the remotest parts of the Bay of Bengal ; it 
is only in some such way that we can explain the name Tibetan Sea 
applied to the Bay by Ishtakri and Ibn Hawkal.” 40 

The career of the remarkable monk Vajrabodhi 41 falls in the 
same period as the South Indian missions to China just mentioned 
and is connected with the ’ most celebrated 
among them. He was a native of South India vajrabodhi 
bom , in 661 A.D. He studied in Nalanda 
till his twenty-sixth year, and then made a pilgrimage to Kapila- 
vastu in 689 before he returned to Southern India, the centre of

the cult of Avalokitesvara. Then Kanci had been suffering for 
three years without rain, and the king Narasimhapotavarman im- 
plored the help of the pious monK, who brought on rain by means of 
prayer. Soon after this V a jrabodhi had a vision in which he was 
ordered to visit Ceylon and to go and worship ManjusrI in the Mid- 
dle Empire of China. He crossed the sea and was solemnly received 
in Ceylon. There he spent six months worshipping the holy relics. 
He returned to India, and with the permission of the king, perhaps 
Narasimhavarman himself, he embarked for China together with 
an ambassador carrying presents to the Emperor. The mission, 
doubtless the same as Narasimhavarman’s mentioned above, halted 
first at the port of Po-tchi-li in Ceylon, which it reached in twenty- 
four hours and in which there were already thirty-five Persian 
vessels that had come to exchange precious stones. The monk became 
friends with the Persian merchants, and after a month’s stay in 
Ceylon all of them sailed together and reached Srivijaya after a 
month’s voyage. The last stage in the voyage ended disastrously, 
all the boats except Vajrabodhi’s being scattered by a tempest. 
After a long series of reverses, he landed at Canton and took the 
road from there to the Eastern capital, where he arrived in 720 A.D. 
Vajrabodhi had introduced the Mahayana into Ceylon when he 
stayed there, and when he died in China in 732, he enjoined his 
pupil Amoghavajra to go to the five Indias and to the kingdom of 
Ceylon. Amoghavajra left Canton on a Malay boat (741) and 
reached Ceylon where he was received with pomp by the ruler 
Silamegha. There he pursued his work with vigour and fixed the 
Mahayana doctrine in its final form. 

Bodhisena, a South Indian Brahmin of the Barachi (Bharad- 
vaja ?) family, was drawn to China by the fame of the land and by 
his desire to meet ManjusrI who was then 
bodhisena reputed to be living in China. On his way, 
he met a priest from Campa, Buttetsu by 
name, and they travelled together to China in 733. Bodhisena 
learnt from a facetious priest that ManjusrI had left for Japan, arid 
just at the time he was pressed by a Japanese embassy taking leave 
of the Chinese court to embark with them for Japan. And Bodhi- 
sena accepted the invitation with alacrity, reached Naniwa 
(modem Osaka) in 736 and was received in great pomp by the 
officials and priests of the court. Bodhisena and his friend Buttetsu 
Jived there for many years as highly honoured guests, and officiated 
in the installation of a great statue of Buddha Vairocana in 749. 
In 750 Bodhisena became Sojo, the head of the entire Buddhist

ecclesiastical order in Japan, and was popularly known as Baramon 
Sojo (Brahman Bishop). He taught Sanskrit and the doctrine 
of the Gandavyuha of the Mahayana at three different monasteries 
till his death in 760 A.D. at the age of fifty-seven. An inscribed 
stupa erected ten years later marks to this day the place of his 
final rest. The Japanese alphabet was fixed about this time and 
shows unmistakable traces of Sanskrit influence, and Takakusu 
suggests that the studies inaugurated by Bodhisena had something 
to do with it. 42 

Several embassies from Ceylon to China are mentioned in the 
eighth century. 43 Some other facts of considerable significance may 
be noted before we leave this phase of Indo-Chinese 
relations. A disciple of the Chinese priest Kien- brahmins 
tchen, who made a voyage from China to Japan in m canton 
749 A.D., while describing the journey (XVII), 
states that the Canton river was full of vessels from India, Persia 
and Arabia, and that in Canton itself there were three Brahmin 
temples where Indian Brahmins lived. And in 881 A.D. a Japanese 
prince, Shinnio Taka-oka by name, who had started on a pilgrimage 
to India, died on his way at Lo-yue, in the southern part of the 
Malay peninsula. 44 Lastly, the Tamil inscription of Takua-pa 
mentioning a Visnu temple, a tank called Naranam and the 
Manigramam (merchant guild) of that place may be assigned also 
to the same period. 45 

A Chinese work of the early ninth century, purporting to 
record facts relating to the eighth, states that the foreign ships 
“ which visited Canton were very large, so high out of the water that 
ladders several tens of feet in length had to be used to get aboard. 
The foreign (Fan) captains who commanded them were registered 
In the office of the Inspector of Maritime Trade (Shi-po-shi) . This 
office (the existence of which, by the way, proves the importance 
of this trade) , before allowing the ships to clear, required that the 
manifests should he submitted to it, and then collected export duty 
and also the freight charges. The export of ‘precious and rare 
articles’ was forbidden, and attempts at smuggling were punished 
with imprisonment.” 46

the rise of Islam there came a sudden ex- 
pansion the effects of which were not confined to religion and 

politics, but spread to commerce and science. The Prophet had 

been himself a merchant in his early life, and this no doubt ex- 
plains in part the great prestige which Muslim merchants enjoyed. 
The dramatic story of the expansion of Muslim power under the 
early Khalifs is well known ; one would expect that the political 
revolutions which accompanied it would have been hindrances to 
trade. But even in the midst of the most rapid and surprising 
conquests, commercial expansion went on apace. In the 16th 
year of the Hegira (637 A.D.), in the Caliphate of Omar, a fleet 
started from the coast of Oman to ravage Sindh and the West Coast 
of India. And before the end of the seventh century, a colony of 
Muslim merchants had established themselves in Ceylon. Some 
Muslim women who had lost their parents in Ceylon were carried 
off by Indian pirates on their way back home, and this event 
furnished a pretext to the famous Hajjaj to invade the Indus Val- 
ley. 47 In 758 A.D. the Arabs and Persians settled in Canton 
were sufficiently numerous for them to be able to raise a tumult 
in the city and turn to their own profit the confusion thus creat- 
ed. 48 In fact politically the Arab empire was not stable and “ it 
split up into various elements almost as quickly as it had been 
constructed. But as an economic and cultural power it remained of 
the greatest significance. It created for a time the conditions 
under which a revival both of prosperity and of learning was 
possible. The actual contribution of Arab scholars and of Arab 
artists is not so important as the work they enabled others to do. 
The empire was not so much Arab as Muslim, not a racial but a 
religious unity. f Out of some sixteen geographers of note 7 (who 
wrote in Arabic), we are told by a modern historian, ‘from the 
ninth to the thirteenth century, four were natives of Persia, four 
of Baghdad, and four of Spain \ ” 49

his co-religionists, and his grandson rose to a high

a position to gather much authentic information on khurbadbeh 
the various parts of the empire and the countries 
with which it maintained relations of one kind or another". His 
Book of Routes and Kingdoms was composed between 844 and 848 
A.D., but was still being modified in 885 A.D. 50 Unfortunately, as 
Masudi remarks, he presents his facts in a dry and incomplete 
manner (XVIII), and if he enters into details occasionally, it is 
only to refer to some quixotic legend. Yet, there is one precious 
passage describing the state of intercommunication between Europe 
and Asia in the second half of the ninth century : 

“ The Jewish merchants speak Persian, Homan (Greek and 
Latin) , Arabic, and the French, Spanish and Slav languages. They 
travel from the West to the East, and from the East to the West, 
now by land and now by sea. They take from the West eunuchs, 
female slaves, boys, silk, furs and swords. They embark in the 
country of the Franks on the Western sea and sail to Farama ; 
there they put their merchandise on the backs of animals and go 
by land marching for five days to Coizom, at a distance of twenty 
parasangs . Then they embark on the Eastern sea (Red Sea) and 
go from Coizom to Hedjaz and Jidda ; and then to Sindh, India 
and China. On their return they bring musk, aloes, camphor, 
cinnamon and other products of the eastern countries, and return 
to Coizom, and then to Farama where they take ship again on the 
Western sea, some going to Constantinople to sell their goods, and 
others to the country of the Franks. 

“ Sometimes the Jewish merchants, in embarking on the 
Western sea, sail (to the mouth of the Oronte) towards Antioch. 
At the end of a three days' march (from there), they reach the 
banks of the Euphrates and come to Baghdad. There they embark 
on the Tigris and descend to Obollah, whence they set sail to Oman, 
Sindh, India and China. The voyage is thus made without inter- 
ruption." 51 .

veiled merchants and scholars, the celebrated Masudi among them. 
Sir ax was then a busy port frequented by merchants from all parts 
of the world, and Abu Zaid declares that his object was to supple- 
ment an earlier work on India and China by adding to it data drawn 
from his own studies and his talks with persons who had travelled 
in the eastern countries. Abu Zaid’s prede- 
suleiman (?) cessor who wrote his work in 851 A.D. has 
often been called Suleiman ; but the evidence 
does not warrant anything more than the cautious conclusion of 
Yule, re-stated by Pelliot, that the work edited by Abu Zaid is a 
compilation of notes made by an anonymous writer “ from his own 
experiences in at least two voyages he made to India at an interval 
of sixteen years and from what he had collected from others who 
had visited China, Suleiman among them. ” 52 “ It is clear, ” says 
Yule, “ from the vagueness of his accounts that the author’s know- 
ledge of India was slight and inaccurate, and that he had no 
distinct conception of its magnitude.” (XIX. i) . However that 
may be, he was largely drawn upon by Masudi who had travelled 
in India and Ceylon and wanted to devote particular attention to 
India. 53 Ibn Al-Fakih (902), another writer of the early tenth 
century. 54 who preceded Abu Zaid and Masudi, also drew largely 
upon this anonymous writer whom Abu Zaid considered worthy of 
being edited more than half a century after the date of the original 
composition. In fact it is a common trait of Arab writers to copy 
one another extensively and it would be otiose to reproduce all 
their accounts. 

Abu Zaid adds many interesting particulars (XIX, ii) to the 
notes of his predecessors. The accuracy of his information is 
established by the remarkably correct account he 
abu zaid gives of the political revolution that caused confu- 

sion in China soon after Suleiman’s visit or visits to 
that country and had entirely stopped the Arab trade with China 
at the time he wrote his work. 

There are many other Arab writers, travellers and geo- 
graphers, of the tenth century, 55 besides those so far mentioned.

But their works have little on Southern India or at least little that 
is new except exaggerated and apocryphal accounts like that of 
the temple of Mankir (Malkhed) from the pen of Abul-Faradj 
(988). 56 The illustrious Al-Biruni (c. 1030) took 
the whole range of human sciences for his al biruni 
sphere ; philosophy, mathematics, chronology, 
medicine, nothing escaped his attention ; he knew Sanskrit 
very well and appears to have read even Greek works 
in the original. 57 He spent many years in India, was the friend 
of Mahmud of Ghazni and his son Mas’ud, and was in correspond- 
ence with Avicenna. He died at Ghazni in 1048. His great work 
on India is an excellent account of Indian religion, philosophy, 
literature, chronology, astronomy, customs, law and astrology. His 
interesting fable on Kikhind (XX) attests the hold of the Rama 
legends on the minds of the people and the attention paid to it by 
Al-Biruni himself. 

To return to the relations between Southern India and China. 
We have seen that the political troubles which broke out in China 
in the latter part of the ninth century had, as Abu 
Zaid remarked, put a stop to the maritime trade china trade 
with the West. The foreigners at Canton and interrupted 
Chuan-chou had to seek refuge in Kalah on the 
West coast of the Malay peninsula and in Palembang in Sumatra. 
And for a time, foreign ships did not proceed beyond Kalah where 
they were met by Chinese vessels. This went on at least till 
Masudfs visit to that place early in the tenth century. 58 What 
took place later when conditions in China again became favourable 
to trade is recorded in the Sung annals as follows : 

“In the 4th year k‘ai-pao (AD. 971) a Merchant Shipping 
office was established at Canton, and later on offices were also 
established at Hang-chou and Ming-chou (Le., 

Ning-po) . All Ta-shih (Arabs) and foreigners revival

ch'eng (Annam), P’o-ni (Borneo), Ma-i (Philippine islands)

ware, their aromatics, rhinoceros horns, tusks of ivory, coral, 
amber, strings of pearls, steel, turtles’ shells, tortoise-shell, corne- 
lians, ch’ih-k’u shells, rock crystal, foreign textile fabrics, ebony, 
sapan-wood, etc. In the Emperor Tai-tsu’s time (960-976) a 
Licence office was established at the capital, and orders were given 
that the foreign aromatic drugs and high priced goods brought to 
Canton, Kiao-chih (Tonkin), the Liang Che and to Ch’uan-chou 
(Zayton) should be deposited in the governmental godowns, and 
that all private trading in pearls, tortoise-shell, rhinoceros horns, 
ivory, steel, turtles’ shells, amber, cornelians and frankincense out- 
side of the official markets was forbidden. All objects not includ- 
ed in the above list might be freely dealt in by the people.” 59 

Besides these steps to monopolise the luxury trade with 
foreigners and regulate all foreign trade, the Chinese government 
also endeavoured successfully to increase its volume by sending a 
trade mission abroad and offering special licences. And this new 
trade movement reached its greatest extension during the southern 
Sung dynasty in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and in course 
of time the growth of an illicit trade in luxuries brought about a 
drain of metallic currency that created anxiety in China. 00 

A casual statement of Caspar Correa, the Portuguese traveller 
who came to India in 1512 and died there in 1563, throws a wel- 
come light on the commercial relations between 
correa’s China and South India towards the close of the 

evidence eleventh century and the beginning of the twelfth, 

and implies that the island of Formosa also took 
a share in this trade. Correa says : “ By the time the Portuguese 
ships arrived (at Calicut in 1498), four centuries had elapsed 
since the year when there came more than eight hundred sailing 
ships from Malacca, China and the land of the Lequeos (Formosa) , 
— ships, great and small, manned by people of various nationalities 
and charged with very rich merchandise which they brought for 
sale. They came to Calicut, navigated the entire coast up to Cam- 
bay, and they were so numerous that they spread themselves over 
the whole country.” 61

INTRODUCTION

Cho'u K'ti-fei, writing in 1178, gives a short and valuable 
sketch of the route taken by Arab merchants in his time : 
“(Traders) coming from the country of the Ta-, 
shl, after travelling south to Quilon (Ku-lin) on f 

small vessels, transfer to big ships, and proceeding 
east, they make Palembang (San-fo-ts‘i) . After 
this they come to China by the same route as the Palembang 
ships.” 62 

Of the countries engaged in trade with China, the same writer 
says : “ Of all the wealthy foreign lands which have great store of 
precious and varied goods, none surpass the realm of the Arabs 
(Ta-shi) . Next to them comes Java (Sho-p‘o) ; the third is Palem- 
bang (San-fo-tsh) ; many others come in the next rank.” 63 Southern 
India does not figure among the states taking the front rank in the 
China trade, though in another passage, Cho'u-^ii-fei does make 
mention of ships from Quilon as distinct from those of the Arabs, 64 
and Quilon was the chief port of South India in this period. But 
the omission of South India may be merely due to the fact that the 
Arabs were the most active sailors of the time doing a large carry- 
ing trade for South India among other lands, and that the Chinese 
vaguely ascribed to their native land all the products they fetched 
in their ships. However that may be, the Chinese attempts to 
revive foreign trade which began in the later 
part of the tenth century happened to coincide cola 
with the rise of the greatest empire of the Tamils, embassies 
the Cola empire of Kajaraja I and his successors. 

And the maritime power of this empire was by no means negligible, 
and the Chinese books bear testimony to the political embassies that 
were received in China from the Cola empire of this period. The 
first mission to reach” China from the Cola country was that of 1015. 
Of this mission, the Sung-shi and Ma Twan-lin record fairly full 
details which will be found extracted elsewhere in this book (Notes 
to XXIII, D). Though the whole journey of the embassy extend-

another in 1077 when the king of Chu-lien was Ti-hua-kia-lo, which 
is a name not easy to explain. 05 

The foreign contacts of the Cola empire in this period are 
attested also by a curious passage in a Mon inscription from Prome 
of the reign of Kyan-Zittha (1084-1112 A.D.) 
a mon record which makes a cryptic reference to the conversion

The great geographer Edrisi, whose work was written under 
the patronage of Roger II of Sicily and completed in 1153-4, de- 
pended exclusively on the writings of his 
EDEISI predecessors like Ibn-Khurdadbeh and Ibn-Hawkal 

for what he said on India. Yule 66 has 
characterised his account of south-eastern Asia, including 
India, as very meagre and confused. “ Professing to give the dis- 
tances between places,” continues Yule, “he generally under- 
estimates these enormously, insomuch that in a map compiled from 
his distances Asia would, I apprehend, assume very contracted 
dimensions.” 

Only a few years later than Edrisi was the Jewish traveller 
from Spain, Benjamin of Tudela, who has some interesting remarks 
to offer on Quilon and South India (XXII). Yule 
of^tudSa doubts if the travels of Benjamin (1159-73) ex- 
tended farther east than the island of Kish in the 
Persian Gulf and says that what he relates of India is to all appear- 
ance hearsay. 67

are second-hand information but notwithstanding this, he 
has placed on record much original matter, facts and information 
of great interest. The large percentage of clear and simple matter- 
of-fact data we find In his work, as compared with the improbable 
and incredible admixtures which we are accustomed to encounter 
in all oriental authors of his time, gives him a prominent, place 
among the mediaeval authors on the ethnography of his time, a 
period particularly interesting to us, as it precedes by about a 
century Marco Polo, and fills a gap in our knowledge of China’s 
relations with the outside world extending from the Arab writers 
of the ninth and tenth centuries to the days of the great Venetian 
traveller.” 09 

Soon after, the Sung empire fell before the Mongols. In 1251 
Mangu Khan became the great Khan, and appointed his brother 
Kublai Khan as the governor-general of China. 

Kublai, an able and energetic commander and the Mongol 
statesman, set about subjugating, by slow and sure empire 
stages, the whole of the Sung empire. Mangu died 
in 1259, and Kublai became the Great Khan in 1260. From this 
time to his death in 1294, his was the most celebrated court in the 
world. Under the Mongol domination there were in fact fewer 
obstacles to China communicating with the other countries of the 
world than at any other time. And the fame of the Great Khan 
that had spread far and wide attracted many persons of various 
types from all parts of the world to China. Scholars and artists, 
merchants, missionaries and ambassadors, musicians and jugglers, 
came crowding in. And living in China for many years together, 
Kublai himself became more and more Chinese In sympathy, 
habits and outlook. Good roads and a quick and efficient postal 
service made for a surprisingly well-organised system of communi- 
cations within the vast limits of the Mongol empire. According to 
Marco Polo, Zayton (Chuan-chou) as a port easily sur- 
passed Alexandria in the heyday of its prosperity. Chinese 
influence spread rapidly in this period to the archipelago 
and in a measure even to India ; we hear of Chinese soldiers 
in the service of the Ceylonese king in 1266 A.D., 70 and the travel- 
lers of the period attest the presence of considerable numbers of 
Chinamen in the ports on the West coast of India. 71

The restlessness of Kublai Khan and his vanity or scientific 
curiosity, together with the very unsettled political conditions that 
prevailed in the Pandyan kingdom towards the 
KUBLAfs close of the thirteenth century, brought about a very 

embassies active exchange of political embassies between 

the Chinese court and the South Indian powers 
between the years 1279 and 1292, and these embassies 
have been succinctly discussed by Rockhill with citations from the 
Chinese annals of the period (XXIV), the Yuan Shih . The 
presence of Buddha relics in Ceylon was another factor which 
provided some of the missions with a definite objective. 

The legitimate king of Ma c bar who sent a secret message to 
the ambassador of Kublai Khan in 1281 must have been Kula- 
sekhara, the Kales Dewar of whom Wassaf, the 
pandyan great Muslim historian of Shiraz, has given the 

politics following account : “ Kales Dewar, the ruler 

of Ma'bar, enjoyed a highly prosperous life, ex^ 
tending to forty and odd years, during which time neither any 
foreign enemy entered his country, nor any severe malady confined 
him to bed. His coffers were replete with wealth inasmuch that 
in the treasury of the city of Mardi (Madura) there were 1,200 
crores of gold deposited, every crore being equal to a thousand 


About 1254, Friar William of Rubruck records that he met the envoy of 
a certain Sultan of India, who had brought as presents to Mangu Khan 
‘eight leopards and ten greyhounds taught to sit on horses’ backs, as leopards 
sit.” (Rockhill, The Journey of Friar William of Rubruck, p. 248). In 
1259 Chang Te wrote the following account of India: “The country of Y in~du 
(Hindusthan) is the nearest to China. The population of it is estimated at 
twelve millions of families. There are in that country famous medicines, 
great walnuts, precious stones, Ki she (cloves) , pin t'ie (fine steel) and other 
products. In this kingdom there are large bells suspended near the palace 
of the ruler. People who have to prefer a complaint strike against the 
bell. Then their names are registered and their cause is investigated. The 
houses are made of reeds. As it is very hot there in summer, people pass 
the whole time in the water ” (Bretschneider, Med. Res. I p. 146) . The same 
writer also notes that ‘diamonds came from Yin~du. The people take flesh 
and throw it into the great valleys (of the mountains). Then birds come 
and eat this flesh, after which diamonds are found in their excrements.’ (ib. 
pp. 151-2). The bell of justice and the method of getting diamonds are 
perhaps old fables; the latter is traced by Major in Epiphanius’ (d. 403 A.D.) 
account of the mode of collecting jacinths in Scythia. (India in the Fifteenth 
Century, p. xlii) . Both, however, were well known in South India— the 
bell of justice in the story of Manu, the legendary Cola king, and the 
diamond gathering method applied to the mines of Golconda.

laks, and every lak to one hundred thousand dinars. Besides this 
there was an accumulation of precious stones, such as pearls, rubies 
turquoises, and emeralds, — more than is in the power of language 
to express. (Here follows a long string of reflections upon the 
instability of worldly wealth and grandeur.) 

“ This fortunate and happy sovereign had two sons, the elder 
named Sundar Pandi, who was legitimate, his mother being joined 
to the Dewar by lawful marriage, and the younger named Tira 
Pandi, was illegitimate, his mother being one of the mistresses who 
continually attended the king in his banquet of pleasure ; for it was 
customary with the rulers of that country that, when the daily 
affairs of the administration were over, and the crowds that attend-* 
ed the court had gone to their respective homes, a thousand beauti- 
ful courtezans used to attend the king in his pleasure. They used to 
perform the several duties prescribed to each of them ; some were 
appointed as chamberlains, some as interpreters, some as cup- 
bearers, and day and night both the sexes kept promiscuous inter- 
course together ; and it was usual for the king to invite to his bed 
that girl upon whom the lot should happen to fall. I have mention- 
ed this in illustration of their customs. 

“ As Tira Pandi was remarkable for his shrewdness and 
intrepidity, the ruler nominated him as his successor. His brother 
Sundar Pandi, being enraged at this supersession, killed 
his father, in a moment of rashness and undutifulness, 
towards the close of the year 709 H. (1310 A.D.), and 
placed the crown on his head in the city of Mardi. 
He induced the troops who were there to support his interests, and 
conveyed some of the royal treasures which were deposited there 
to the city of Mankul, and he himself accompanied, marching on, 
attended in royal pomp with the elephants, horses and treasures* 
Upon this his brother Tira Pandi, being resolved on avenging his 
father’s blood, followed to give him battle, and on the margin of a 
lake which, in their language, they call Talachi, the opponents came 
to action. Both the brothers, each ignorant of the fate of the other, 
fled away ; but Tira Pandi being unfortunate (tira bakht) , and 
having been wounded, fell into the hands of the enemy, and seven 
elephant-loads of gold also fell to the lot of the army of Sundar 
Pandi, 

“ It is a saying of philosophers, that ingratitude will, sooner or 
later, meet its punishment, and this was proved in the sequel, for 
Manar Barnaul, the son of the daughter of Kales Dewar, who

espo use d the cause of Tira Pandi, being at that time at Karamhatti, 
near Kalul, sent him assistance, both in men and money, which 
was attended with a most fortunate result. Sundar Pandi had 
taken possession of the kingdom, and the army and the treasure 
were his own; but, as in every religion and faith, evil deeds 
produce a life of insecurity, a matter which it is unnecessary to 
expatiate upon, he, notwithstanding all his treasures and the good- 
will of the army, was far from being happy and prosperous, enter- 
taining crude notions, and never awaking from his dream 
of pride, and at last he met with the chastisement due to his in- 
gratitude, for in the middle of the year 710 (1310 A.D.) Tira 
Pandi, having collected an army, advanced to oppose him, and 
Sundar Pandi, trembling and alarmed, fled from his native country, 
and took refuge under the protection of ‘Alau-d-din, of Delhi, 
and Tira Pandi became firmly established in his hereditary king- 
dom. 

“ While I was engaged in writing this passage, one of my friends 
said to me : ‘ The kings of Hind are celebrated for their penetra- 

tion and wisdom ; why then did Kales Dewar, during his life-time, 
nominate his younger and illegitimate son as his successor, to the 
rejection of the elder, who was of pure blood, by which he intro- 
duced distraction into a kingdom which had been adorned like a 
bride.” 72 

The troubles between Kulasekhara's children that ended so 
disastrously for him and his kingdom evidently started very much 
earlier in his reign. The affairs of the South Indian Kingdom 
round about 1281 as recorded in the Yiian~shiJi give sufficient indi- 
cation of this. Even the great Kublai Khan could not have 
interceded with any tangible effect in the affairs of so remote a 
country ; but we owe it to his interest in these distant lands that 
we have before us a business-like record of occurrences in South 
India of which we should have otherwise remained ignorant. But 
the questions arising out of these diplomatic embassies cannot be 
pursued further here. 

‘Marco Polo's journey to the East was the beginning of direct 
contact between the Far East and Europe— with the exception of 
the Roman embassy of the time of Marcus Aurelius 
harco polo recorded above.' 73 This ‘ prince of mediaeval 
travellers' reached the court of Kublai Khan 
after a hazardous journey of three years and a half

across Asia. He became a great favourite of the Khan and spent 
seventeen years with him, being employed by him in several im- 
portant missions in different parts of his empire. Finally he was 
chosen to escort a princess of the Khan’s family, who had to be sent 
as a bride for the ruler of Persia. He left China in 1292 and his 
voyage to Persia through the Indian seas lasted about a year and a 
half. Thence he travelled to Constantinople, and finally reached 
Venice in 1295. 

During the years that Marco Polo spent in the East he had 
exceptional opportunities for observation, and he used them well 
He was only passing through some parts of South India on his way 
to Persia, and the amount of information he was able to collect on 
these countries is indeed surprising. His work has come down in 
several recensions of varying authenticity, and it is sometimes 
difficult to distinguish what he wrote from later accretions. And 
for a time his name passed under a cloud and his veracity was 
impeached partly on account of the fables that had crept into copies 
of his work. But now, as Yule observes, ‘his veracity and justness 
of observation still shine brighter under every recovery of lost or 
forgotten knowledge.’ 74 Marco Polo was doubtless himself res- 
ponsible for some of the fictitious and fabulous statements in his 
book, for he often records the things he heard in addition to those 
he saw, and perhaps he did not always understand correctly what 
he saw in so many strange lands. But when all deductions have 
been made, his narrative still remains an invaluable source of 
knowledge about the countries he touched. 

It is with his return voyage by sea from China to Persia that 
we are primarily concerned (XXV), and I can do no better than 
reproduce the following summary and estimate by Major of this 
part of Marco’s travels : “ He touched at the kingdom of Ziamba 
(Tsiampa, Campa), where he learned much of Great Java or Java, 
though he did not himself visit either ‘that island or Borneo. He 
then sailed southward, and passing the small island of Pentan 
(Bintang) came to Java Minor, under which name he designates 
Sumatra. He appears then to have sailed along its coast through 
the Straits of Malacca to Seilan (Ceylon) , noticing on his way the 
island Angaman (Andaman Islands). After some stay at Ceylon 
he sailed to Maabar, which, however, must not be confounded with 
Malabar, but is the coast of Coromandel. He notices its fine cot- 

74. Cathay: i, p. 165. 



32 FOREIGN NOTICES 

tons ; also its various superstitions, as the worship of the cow, the 
abstinence from animal food, the courtezans dedicated to the 
service of the temple, and the acts of voluntary self-sacrifice to their 
gods, as well as the custom of females burning themselves after 
the death of their husbands. Then passing Cape Comorin he sailed 
along the coasts of Malabar, where he notices the abundance of 
pepper and ginger; then along those of Guzerat and Cambaia, and 
so, across the Indian Ocean, home. 

“In the course of his inquiries and explorations, Marco Polo 
took pains to make himself acquainted with the natural history of 
each country, and especially with such products as by their costli- 
ness or usefulness might become valuable as articles of commerce. 
By his observations on the manufactures and navigation of different 
countries, he constantly shows his sense of what would be chiefly 
interesting to a maritime and commercial people like the Venetians, 
to whose nation he belonged ; and a rich field for such observation 
lay before him. The commerce of India he found stretching, like 
an immense chain, from the territories of Kublai Khan to the 
shores of the Persian Gulf and of the Red Sea. He found the 
shores and the islands of the India Sea luxuriantly covered with 
nature’s choicest productions. In lieu of wine, the palm tree gave 
its milk, and the bread fruit tree afforded its wholesome food. The 
betel nut, and spices, and everything which might flatter the palate 
of man, he found in rich abundance in those climates, and if he 
does not minutely describe them, he at least names the different 
plants from which these luxuries were procured. Nor is he silent 
upon those less useful but not less highly prized productions of 
India which are derived from beneath the surface of the earth. 
He tells ys of the topaz, the amethyst, and the emerald, of the 
sapphires of Ceylon, and the diamonds of Golconda, and the rubies 
from the mountains of Thibet.” 75 


The Yuan shill records an attempt on the part of the Chinese 
government in 1296 to prohibit the export of gold and silver, as 
also to limit the value of the trade with Ma'bar 
restriction (Coromandel), Kulam (Quilon), and Fandaraina 

in china to a relatively small sum of money. 76 Ma Twan-

being much in favour with the ruler of the land, they received rich 
gifts from him. 77 

By the side of the bright star of Marco Polo, other European 
travellers of the Middle Ages seem to lack lustre. But if the 
Venetian merchant represents one side of the 
culture contacts between the West and the East, Christian 
the three monks who visited South India soon friars 
after Marco Polo represent another. First among 
them was the Franciscan friar John of Monte Corvino who c already 
nearly fifty years of age ? plunged alone into China, * that great 
ocean of Paganism, and of what he deemed little better, Nestori- 
anism, to preach the Gospel. ’ 78 His travel to China by way of 
India fell in 1292-3. He became later archbishop 
of Camblue where he died in 1328. This lonely J0HN OF 
monk was out of sympathy with much that he saw in C0RVIND 
India (XXVI) ; with him may be said to begin the 
stream of Christian missionary criticism of Indian life and habits 
which has not always been either intelligent or charitable. John’s 
account of ships and navigation in the Indian seas has much in 
common with similar statements of other writers and may be use- 
fully compared with them. Nearly thirty years after John of 
Monte Corvino left the shores of India came Friar 
Odoric of Pordenone, who was in India soon after odoric 
1321. From Hormuz he embarked for Tana near 
Bombay (XXVII- A) ; either here or from Surat, “he 
gathered the bones of four brethren who had suffered 
there In 1321 (as related by Friar Jordanus) and carried them with 
him on his voyage eastward. He went on to Malabar, touching at 
Pandarani, Cranganor, and KuXam (Quilon) , and proceeded thence 
to Ceylon and the shrine of St. Thomas at Mailapur, the modern 
Madras.” 79 His account of some Hindu customs and practices is 
doubtless that of an eye-witness (XXVII B, C, D) . 

Lastly we have Friar Jordanus. It is possible that Jordanus 
first came to India some years before Odoric, and 
two of his letters are dated from India in 1321 and jordanus 
1324. In both of them, he holds out to 
his brother Friars in Europe the prospect of extensive mis-

sionary work in the East (XXVIII-A). He says, for instance in 
his letter of 1321 A.D.: “ I will only say a word as to the harvest 
to be expected, that it promises to be great and encouraging. 
Let friars be getting ready to come, for there are three places 
that I know where they might reap a great harvest and where 
they could live in common. One of these is Supera where two 
Friars might be stationed ; and a second is in the district of Paroc- 
co, where two or three might abide ; and the third is Columbus ; 
besides many others that I am not acquainted with.” 80 The three 
places named here are Supara, Broach and Quilon. Jor- 
danus was appointed Bishop of Columbum 81 (or Colum- 
bus, Quilon) in 1328, and it is most likely that he 
wrote Mirabilia between this date and that of his second 
departure from Europe, 1330. 82 It is not known that Jordanus 
ever reached Columbum as its bishop. His mention of the Parsis 
in India and their mode of exposing the dead deserves to be noted 
as among the earliest notices of this community, if not actually 
the first account of them (XXVIII B, C). 

There is one more friar we must notice ; he is John of Marig- 
nolli, a native of Florence. He was appointed Papal legate to the 
court of the Great Khan in response to a request 
john from him received by the Pope ten years after the 

he MABiGNomr death of John of Monte Corvino, the founder of the 
Cathay mission and Archbishop of Cambluc. 
Like Marco Polo, John of Marignolli took the land route to China 
and left China by sea via Zayton in 1346 or 1347. Of the voyage 
that followed he says nothing more than that he arrived at Colum- 
bum (Quilon) in Malabar (XXXI- A). “He remained with the 

Christians of Columbum upwards of a year, and then, during the 
south-west monsoon of 1348 or 1349, set sail for the Coromandel 
coast to visit the shrine of Thomas the Apostle. After passing only 
four days there,” he went to Saba, which has not been satisfactorily 
identified, though it seems probable that some part of Sumatra is 
meant. When he quitted Saba, he was overtaken by a storm which 
drove his vessel to Ceylon perhaps against his wish. And in spite 
of his unpleasant experiences in the island at the hands of a Mussal- 
man chieftain, Marignolli’s recollections of Ceylon were very 
pleasant and he locates the Earthly Paradise very near that island

if not actually there. His account of the Buddhist monks of Ceylon 
makes interesting reading. He returned to Europe in 1353 and 
wrote down his recollections soon after (XXXI B, C). He was 
perhaps an aged man at the time, 83 

Abulfeda (1273 — 1331) , the celebrated Arab historian and 
geographer, does not mark any great advance in 
knowledge relating to India, His notices of South abulfeda 
India are brief, vague and secondhand (XXIX). 

He cites the inveterate traveller and geographer Ibn Said (1214 — 
1274 or 1286) quite often. 

On the other hand the Moorish traveller Ibn Battuta was an 
indefatigable explorer. Born in Tangier about 1306, he left his 
native place at the age of twenty-two, and continued 
to travel incessantly for the next thirty years. He im eattuta. 
died at Fez in 1377. He did not write his work 
himself, but was content 4 to dictate to a copyist the 
description of the towns he visited, the anecdotes and 
history he could recall and so on.’ He was by profession a doctor 
of the Muhammadan law and traditions. A detailed summary of 
his experiences in South India will be found reproduced from Yule 
elsewhere in this book (XXX-C-i) as an introduction to the 
translation of the original narrative which follows. “ The adven- 
tures which befell Ibn Battuta during his long sojourn in India,” 
says Major, “ form one of the most curious and eventful chapters 
of his peregrinations ; and this part of his narrative derives addi- 
tional interest from the details which he introduces, not only of the 
natural productions and agriculture of the country, but of the 
manners, institutions and history of Hindustan, under the Affghan 
dynasties, which preceded for nearly three hundred years the 
establishment of the Mogul power. He gives an historical retros- 
pect, extending from the first conquest of Delhi by the Muham- 
medans under Kotbed-din Ai-bek, in 1188, to the accession of the 
reigning sovereign, Sultan Muhammed, the son of Tughlak, in 1325; 
which is especially valuable from the additional facts which it 
supplies, and the light thrown on many of the transactions recorded 
by Ferishta. This preliminary sketch is continued by the personal 
narrative of Ibn Battuta himself, whose fortune led him to India 
at the crisis when the unity of the Patan power (at all times rather 
an aristocracy of military leaders than a consolidated monarchy) 
was on the point of dissolution, from the mad tyranny of Sultan

Muhammed, which drove all the governors of provinces into open 
revolt, and led to the erection of independent kingdoms in Bengal, 
the Dekhan, etc. On the arrival of an embassy from the emperor 
of China, he gladly accepted an appointment as one of the envoys 
destined to convey the gifts sent in return by Sultan Muhammed ; 
and receiving his outfit and credentials, quitted without delay the 
dangerous walls of Delhi early in the year of the Hejira 743 
(A.D. 1342) ” 84 

Sidi Ali Celibi (1554) is one of the latest among the foreign 
Muhammadan writers on India. He was an admiral, poet and 
writer. He came to India, and visited important 
sidi ali towns in it in order to get into touch with the 

learned men in the country and to collect all books 
in Arabic, Persian and Turkish treating of the art of 
navigation. He returned to Constantinople by the land route 
across the N.W. of India, Badakshan, Transoxiana and Persia. Some 
sailing directions from his treatise called Mohit, The Ocean, are 
reproduced in an Appendix (App. IV) . He based his work on ten 
earlier works, three ancient and seven modern. Among the modern 
authorities used by Sidi Ali was Ahmad Ibn Majid 
aKMA n (A.D. 1489-90) , who called himself “ Master of 

ibn majid Navigation and Lion of the Raging Sea.” Though 

the Portuguese sources are not clear on this point, 
it seems possible that he helped Vasco da Gama to reach India. 
In his Nautical Instructions he often refers to the opinions of Cola 
mariners, and so does Suleiman al Mahri (C 1511-53). Ibn Majid 
records that in his day, at the commencement of the period of Saba 
(east winds) a flotilla of ships left Komar (Madagascar) to the 
destination of Zang (part of the East African coast, say 3° N.L. to 
3° S.L.), of Marima (same coast, say 8° to 11° S.L.), of Hormuz 
and of Al-Hind (the West coast of India) . 85 

Contemporary with Ibn Battuta was the Chinese mer chan t 
Wang Ta-Yiian who visited a number of foreign countries for pur- 
poses of trade between the years 1330 and 1349. 
wang ta-otan His Tao i chi lio (Description of the Barbarians

In 1382, an embassy from Java to China took “black slaves, 
men and women, to the number of one hundred, eight large 
pearls, and 75,000 catti of pepper, 5587 which shows that towards the 
end of the fourteenth century the interrelations between China, 
Java and India continued more or less unchanged. 

At the beginning of the fifteenth century, ‘ the third emperor 
of the Ming dynasty, whose reign is known under the title of Yong- 
lo (1403-25) sent out a series of naval expeditions 
overseas which established the fame and the su- ming policy 
premacy of the new dynasty far and wide and 
which prompted a score of princes to despatch em- 
bassies to the Chinese court and pay homage to the Emperor/ 88 
These embassies were stupendous enterprises, comprising a fleet 
of 62 vessels and 37,000 soldiers on the first occasion, each ship 
being 440 feet by 180. And among their commanders none was 
more famous than the eunuch Cheng Ho. The 
initial motive of these embassies lay in the desire cheng ho 
of the emperor to ascertain the whereabouts 
of his nephew Kien Wen dethroned by him and suspected 
to have hidden himself somewhere in the countries beyond 
the sea. 89 

Cheng Ho was accompanied in these voyages by two persons 
whose writings throw much welcome light on the state of the 
countries they visited. One was Fei Hsin whose 
work Hsing cha sheng lan or ‘ Description of the fei hsin 
star raft ’ bears a preface dated 1436 and 
thus forms one of the earliest accounts we have of the cele- 
brated voyages of Cheng Ho. We do not know in what capacity 
Fei Hsin was attached to Cheng Ho’s suite. His work describes 
forty countries or localities ; the author borrows much from earlier 
writers but also gives much that is new, and sometimes elucidates 
and supplements the brief notes of his predecessors (XXXIII) . 90

FOREIGN NOTICES 


The other was the better known Ma Huan, a Chinese Muslim, 
who, on account of his knowledge of foreign languages, was attach- 
ed as Interpreter to the expedition of 1412-13. 
ma huan The voyages of Cheng Ho and the texts of Ma 

Huan have been recently studied at some 
length and with great critical acumen by Duyvendak and 
Pelliot, and it seems desirable to state here the broad conclusions 
that emerge from these studies. 

The first voyage to the Western seas was ordered in the sixth 
month of the third year of Yong-lo ; i.e., 27th June-2 5th July 1405. 

In the voyage Cheng Ho visited Calicut (Ku-li) 
CHENG HO’S where he erected a stele, and probably visited 
voyages Ceylon. On his return he captured the pirate 

Chen-Tsu-yi of Palembang and carried him to China 
where he was put to death. 91 The second voyage was in Sep. — Oct. 
1408 and was primarily directed to Ceylon though it went as far 
as Cochin and Calicut (Fei Hsin). The king of this island, 
A-lie-k‘ou-nai-eul (Alagakkonara, i.e., Vijaya Bahu VI) lured 
Cheng Ho into the interior and then despatched soldiers to pillage 
his ships in his absence. Cheng Ho rose equal to the occasion. 
When he found the interior depleted of its soldiers, he put himself 
at the head of the 2000 men or so that he had with him and took 
the capital city and made prisoners of A-lie-k £ ou-nai-eul, his wife 
and children, together with his principal officials. In June- July 
1411, Cheng Ho presented his prisoners at the Chinese Court, the 
emperor was merciful to them and set them free to return to their 
country. There is a Chinese inscription in Ceylon, discovered at 
Galle in 1911, commemorating this visit of Cheng Ho to Ceylon. 92 
The third voyage lasted from December 1412— Jan. 1413 to Aug.— 
Septr. 1415. Ma Huan went on this voyage in the course of which 
Ceylon, Cochin, Calicut, the Maldives and Ormuz were visited. 
The Ming skih adds Kayal to the list. Thus in this voyage Cheng 
Ho went beyond India for the first time. The fourth voyage was 
from 1416 to 1419. Ma Huan was not on this embassy which went 
up to Africa and as a result of which nineteen kingdoms sent 
embassies bearing tribute to China. Ma Huan joined the fifth 
voyage (1421-22) , an exceptionally rapid one which induced fifteen 
states, Calicut among others, to send embassies to China in 1423. The 
sixth voyage lasted from February 1424 to March 1425, and before

it returned, there had occurred a change on the Chinese throne. The 
new emperor was opposed to these voyages and posted Cheng Ho 
to guard the southern capital, Nanking. But this emperor died in 
May 1425, and his successor revived the old practice five years 
later. In the seventh and last voyage (1430) Cheng Ho visited 
Calicut, Quilon and Cochin, and according to the Ming Shih the 
Maldives also were visited by Cheng Ho, Ma Huan and Fei Hsin. 
Possibly Ma Huan went to Mecca on this occasion. 

Cheng Ho himself, it may be noted, though a Mussulman and 
son of a haji, showed an inclination to Buddhism with that eclec- 
ticism of which there were many instances in the Mongol period. 93 

The knowledge of the world gathered by the Chinese as a 
result of these expeditions was proved inadequate by the coming 
of the Europeans soon after ; but the accounts of these voyages 
fill a gap from Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta to the early Portuguese. 

Ma Huan’s work was first published in 1451. Ma Huan’s style 
was that of an unlettered sailor, prolix and lacking in 
literary quality. The book is called Ying-yai-

1 MEGASTHENES 


(A) Of Taprobane 

Megasthenes says that Taprobane is separated from the main- 
land by a river ; that the inhabitants are called Palaiogonoi, 1 and 
that their country is more productive of gold and large pearls than 
India. Taprobane is separated from India by a river flowing bet- 
ween ; for one part of it abounds with wild beasts and elephants 
much larger than India breeds, and man claims the other part.

(B) i. P&Tidya, 

The Pandaean nation is governed by females, and their first 
queen is said to have been the daughter of Hercules. The city 
Nysa is assigned to this region, as is also the mountain sacred to 
Jupiter, Meros by name, in a cave on which the ancient Indians 
affirm Father Bacchus was nourished ; while the name has given 
rise to the well-known fantastic story that Bacchus was bom from 
the thigh of his father. Beyond the mouth of the Indus are two 
islands, Chryse and Argyre, which yield such an abundant supply 
of metals that many writers allege their soils consist of gold and 
of silver.

ii Of Hercules and Pandaea 

Herakles begat a daughter in India whom he called Pandaia. 
To her he assigned that portion of India which lies to southward and 
extends to the sea, while he distributed the people subject to her 
rule into 365 villages, giving orders that one village should each 
day bring to the treasury the royal tribute, so that the queen might 
always have the assistance of those men whose turn it was to pay 
the tribute in coercing those who for the time being were defaul- 
ters in their payments. 2

42 FOKEIGN NOTICES 

(C) Of the Beasts of India? 

(17) In the sea which has been mentioned they say there is 
a very large island, of which, as I hear, the name is Taprobane. 
From what I can learn, it appears to be a very long and moun- 
tainous island, having a length of 7000 stadia and a breadth of 
5000. 3 4 It has not, however, any cities, but only villages, of which 
the number amounts to 750. The houses in which the inhabitants 
lodge themselves are made of wood, and sometimes also of reeds. 

(18) In the sea which surrounds the islands, tortoises are 
bred of so vast a size that their shells are employed to make roofs 

for the houses : for a shell, being fifteen cubits in 
tortoises length, can hold a good many people under it, 

screening them from the scorching heat of the sun, 
besides affording them a welcome shade. But, more than this, it is 
a protection against the violence of storms of rain far more effective 
than tiles, for it at once shakes off the rain that dashes against it, 
while those under its shelter hear the rain rattling as on the roof 
of a house. At all events they do not require to shift their abode, 
like those whose tiling is shattered, for the shell is hard and like a 
hollowed rock and the vaulted roof of a natural cavern. 

The island then, in the great sea, which they call Taprobane, 
has palm-groves, where the trees are planted with wonderful regu- 
larity all in a row, in the way we see the keepers of pleasure-parks 
plant out shady trees in the choicest spots. It has also herds of 
elephants, which are there very numerous and of the largest size. 
These island elephants are more powerful than those of the main- 
land, and in appearance larger, and may be pro- 
elephants nounced to be in every possible way more intelli- 
gent. The islanders export them to the 
mainland opposite in boats, which they construct expressly 
for this traffic from wood supplied by the thickets of the island, and 
they dispose of their cargoes to the king of the Kalingai. On ac- 
count of the great size of the island, the inhabitants of the interior 
have never seen the sea, but pass their lives as if resident on a

continent, though no doubt they learn from others that they are 
aU around enclosed by the sea. The inhabitants,' again, of the 
coast have no practical acquaintance with elephant-catching, and 
know of it only by report. All their energy is devoted to catch- 
ing fish and the monsters of the deep ; for the sea encircling the 
island is reported to breed an incredible number of 
fish, both of the smaller fry and of the monstrous sea monsters 
sort, among the latter being some which 
have the heads of lions and of panthers and of other 
wild beasts, and also of rams ; and, what is still a greater marvel, 
there are monsters which in all points of their shape resemble 
satyrs. Others are in appearance like women, but, instead of 
having locks of hair, are furnished with prickles. It is even solemn- 
ly alleged that this sea contains certain strangely formed creatures, 
to represent which in a picture would baffle all the skill of the 
artists of the country, even though, with a view to make a pro- 
found sensation, they are wont to paint monsters which consist of 
different parts of different animals pieced together. These have 
their tails and the parts which are wreathed of great length, and 
have for feet either claws or fins. I learn further that they are 
amphibious, and by night graze on the pasture fields, for they eat 
grass like cattle and birds that pick up seeds. They have also a 
great liking for the date when ripe enough to drop from the palms, 
and accordingly they twist their coils, which are supple, and large 
enough for the purpose, around these trees, and shake them so 
violently that the dates come tumbling down, and afford them a 
welcome repast. Thereafter when the night begins gradually to 
wane, but before there is yet clear daylight, they disappear by 
plunging into the sea just as the first flush of morning faintly illu- 
mines its surface. They say whales also frequent this sea, though 
it is not true that they come near the shore lying in wait for 
thunnies. The dolphins are reported to be of two sorts — one fierce 
and armed with sharp-pointed teeth, which gives endless trouble 
to the fisherman, and is of a remorselessly cruel disposition, while 
the other kind is naturally mild and tame, swims about in the 
friskiest way, and is quite like a fawning dog. It does not run 
away when any one tries to stroke it, and takes with pleasure any 
food it is 'offered,

II. KASTCI AND CHINA IN THE SECOND CENTURY B.C. 

Pan Kou, a Chinese writer who lived not later than the end 
of the first century A.D., says in his Ts’ien han chou : 

“ From the gates of Je-nan, 1 from Siu-Wen and Ho-p’ou travel- 
ling by boat for five months we reach the kingdom of Ton-Yuan. 

After a further journey of about four months 
itinerary by sea is reached the kingdom of Yi-lou-nio. 

By sailing still further for a period of over 
twenty days, the kingdom of Chen-li is reached. From there 
you travel more than ten days by land to the kingdom of Fou-kan- 
tou-lou. 2 ("From the kingdom of Fou-kan-tou-lou, going by boat for 
more thanrtwo months you reach the kingdom of Houang-tche. The 
habits of the people there generally resemble those of the people 
of Tchou-yai. These are extensive and populous lands, full of 
strange products. From the time of Emperor Wou (140-86 B.C.) 
all of them have been sending tribute. 3 There are official inter- 
preters who belong to the (administration of the) palace houang - 
men (yellow-gate) ; with the recruits they go by sea to buy shin- 
ing pearls, glass, 4 rare stones and strange products, giving gold and 
silks in exchange. In the lands to which they go, the people supply 
them with food and join them in their repast. The merchant ships 
of the foreigners take them to their destination by turns. These 
foreigners also profit by the trade ; (besides) they also plunder 
and kill people. Moreover (the passengers) have to be afraid 
of tempests which drown them. If nothing happens, they take 
many years to go and come back. The large pearls measure up 
to seven inches. 5 In the period of Yuan-che (1-6 A.D.) of the 
emperor Ping, Wang Mang desired to transform the government 
and manifest stately power. He sent rich presents to the king of 
Houang-tche and asked him to send an embassy bringing a live 
rhinoceros as tribute. From the kingdom of Houang-tche, going 
by boat for about eight months, we reach Pl-tsong. 6 Travelling 
again by sea for about two months, we get to the frontier of Siang-

lin in Je-nan. They say that to the south of Houang-tche lies the 
kingdom of Ssen-teh’eng-pou, whence the interpreter envoys of 
the Han return,” 7 

It is seen, observes Pelliot, that Pan-Kou has joined two series 
of data, one going back to the period of the emperor Won (140-86 
B.C.) , and the other coming from the envoys 
of Wang Mang in the initial years of the critique 
Christian era. He also points out that in 
this passage, in spite of its obscurities, we are in the realm of 
history, not legend. Now the country which is reached after a 
year’s voyage from the coasts of Indo-China, and from which pearls 
and glass were procured, must have been in the midst of the 
Indian ocean, 8 possibly even at its western end. Herrmann locates 
Houang-tche in Abyssinia and B. Laufer in Malaya ; Ferrand re- 
jects these identifications with good reason, 9 and says : “ Phoneti- 
cally, the equivalence Houng-tche < Kanci is satisfactory for the 
epoch of Han ; historically it is possible ” 10 that China had relations 
with Kanci in the second century B.C. Let us note also this. A 
Cola embassy of the eleventh century from Coromandel to Canton 
took eight months to complete the journey ; Pan Kou gives ten 
months to one year for the same voyage, nearly a dozen centuries 
earlier. Chinese vessels, it should be noted finally, had not yet 
begun to sail to India ; they began to do so only much later. And 
the Chinese are distinctly stated by Pan Kou to have depended for 
their transport on foreign ships. But he makes it no less clear 
that from the first century B.C. the products of Southern India had 
begun to reach China by sea, and that at the beginning of the 
Christian era, under orders of the Court, a Chinese mission traversed 
the entire Indian ocean. 11

(A) i — Pandyan (?) embassy to Augustus 

The merchants of the present day who sail from Egypt to India 
by the Nile and the Arabian Gulf have seldom made a voyage as 
far- as the Ganges. They are ignorant men and unqualified for 
writing an account of the places they have visited. From one 
place in India and from one Icing, Pandion, but according to other 
writers, Poros, there came to Caesar Augustus 1 gifts and an 
embassy accompanied by the Indian sophist who committed him- 
self to the flames at Athens, like Kalanos, who had exhibited a 
similar spectacle in the presence of Alexander.

Crindle, p. 9, para 4. 

(A) ii — Indian embassy to Augustus 

Mkolaos Damaskenos 2 says that at Antioch by Daphne he met 
with the Indian ambassadors who had been sent to Augustus 
Caesar. It appeared from the letter that their number had been 
more than merely the three he reports that he saw. The rest had 
died chiefly in consequence of the length of the journey. The letter 
was written in Greek on parchment and imported that Poros was 
the writer, and that though he was the sovereign of 600 kings, he 
nevertheless set a high value on being Caesar’s friend and was 
willing to grant him a passage wherever he wished through his domi- 
nions, and to assist him in any good enterprise. Such, he says, 
were the contents of the letter. Eight naked servants presented 
the gifts that were brought. They had girdles encircling their 
waists and were fragrant with ointments. The gifts consisted of 
a Hermes born wanting arms from the shoulders whom I have 
myself seen, large snakes and a serpent ten cubits long, and a 
river tortoise three cubits long, and a partridge larger than a vul- 
ture. They were accompanied, it is said, by the man who burned 
himself at Athens. This is done by persons in misfortune seeking 
relief from their present circumstances, and by others in prosperity,

which was the case with this man. For as everything had gone 
well with him up to this time, he thought it necessary to depart, 
lest if he tarried longer in the world some unexpected calamity 
should befall him. He therefore with a smile leaped upon the

4 For both the Scythians and Sarmatians sent ambassadors begging our 
alliance. The Seres also and the Indians who live under the Sun, together 
with jewels and precious stones, bringing elephants also amongst their presents, 
reckoned nothing so much an obligation laid upon the Emperor, as the length 
of their journey, which they had finished in four years, and notwithstanding 
the complexion of the men showed that they came from another climate/ 

Orosius, a native of Tarraeo (Tarragona), (c. 420 A.D.), states in his 
History (vi. 12) that * an Indian embassy reached Augustus at the time when 
he was residing in that city. As the date of this embassy does not tally with 
that noticed by Nicolaos, some have supposed that there were two different 
embassies, but this is highly improbable. Orosius is by no means an accurate 
historian. 

Dion Cassius (ix. 58) (end of second century A.D.) also mentions this 
Indian embassy in these terms: — 

4 Numerous embassies came to him (Augustus at Samos, B.C. 21) , and the 
Indians having first proclaimed a league of amity with him, obtained its rati- 
fication, and presented him, besides other gifts, with tigers also — animals seen 
then for the first time by the Romans, and, if I mistake not, even by the Greeks. 
They gave him also a stripling without arms (like the statues we see of 
Hermes), but as dexterous in using his feet as others their hands, for with 
them he could bend a bow, hurl a dart, and put a trumpet to his mouth. One 
of the Indians, Zarmaros, perhaps to make a show for the Athenians and 
Augustus who was then in Athens, resolved to put an end to his life. And 
having been initiated in the mysteries of the two gods (Demeter and Perse- 
phone) which were held out of the ordinary course on account of the initiatioo 
of Augustus, he committed his living body to the flames/ (McCrindle, op. cit

extending about 8000 stadia in the direction of Ethiopia. It too 
produces elephants. Such are the accounts of Eratosthenes ; and 
these, when supplemented by the accounts of other writers when 
they convey exact information, will determine the nature of our 
description of India. 

Onesikritos, 6 for example, says with regard to Taprobane that 
it has a magnitude of 5000 stadia, without distinction of length or 
breadth ; that it is distant from the mainland a voyage of twenty 
days, but that the vessels employed for the voyage sail badly owing 
to the wretched quality of their sails, and to the peculiarity of their 
structure ; that other islands lie between it and India, but 

that Taprobane lies farthest to the south ; that there are 

found around its shores cetaceous animals which are amphibious 
and in appearance like oxen, horses, and other land animals.

The entrance of a Roman army into Arabia Felix under the

traffic of the Alexandrian merchants whose vessels pass up the 
Nile and Arabian Gulf to India, have rendered us much better ac- 
quainted with these countries than our predecessors were. I was 
with Gallus at the time he was prefect of Egypt, and ac- 
companied him as far as Syene and the frontiers of Ethiopia, and 

I found that about one hundred and twenty ships sail from Myos- 
Hormos 7 to India, although in the time of the Ptolemies scarcely 
any one would venture on this voyage and the commerce with the 
Indies.

(A) Description of Taprobane ( Ceylon ) 

Taprobane, under the name of the 4 Land of the Antiehthones/ 
was long regarded as another world The age and achievements 
of Alexander the Great made it clear that it is an island, 
Gnesikritos, the commander of his fleet, had stated that its 
elephants are larger and more bellicose than those of India, and 
from Megasthenes we learn that it' is divided by a river, and that 
its inhabitants are called Paleogoni, and that it is more productive 
of gold and pearls of a greater size than India itself. Eratosthenes 
has also given its dimensions as 7000 stadia in length and 5000 
stadia in breadth, 1 while he states that it has no cities, but villages 
to the number of seven hundred. It begins at the Eastern Sea, and 
lies extended over against India east and west. The island in former 
days, when the voyage to it was made with vessels constructed of 
papyrus and rigged after the manner of the vessels of the Nile, was 
thought to be twenty days’ sail from the country of the Prasii, but 
the distance came afterwards to be reckoned at a seven days’ sail, 
according to the rate of speed of our ships. The sea between the 
island and India is full of shallows not more than six paces in 
depth, but in some channels so deep that no anchors can find the 
bottom. For this reason ships are built with prows at each end to 
obviate the necessity of their turning about in channels of extreme 
narrowness. The tonnage of these vessels is 3000 amphorae. 2 In 
making sea-voyages, the Taprobane mariners make no observations 
of the stars, and indeed the Greater Bear is not visible to them, 
but they take birds out to sea with them which they let loose from 
time to time and follow the direction of their flight as they make 
for land. 3 4 The season for navigation is limited to four months,, and 
they particularly shun the sea during the hundred days which 
succeed the summer solstice, for it is then winter in those seas. 4 

So much we have learned form the old writers. It has been 
our lot, however, to obtain a more accurate knowledge of the

In the course of fifteen days he had been wafted to Hippuri, 6 a 
port of Taprobane, where he was humanely received and hospitably 
entertained by the king; and having in six months’ time learned 
the language, he was able to answer the questions he was asked. 
The king particularly admired the Romans and their emperor as 
men possessed of an unheard-of love of justice, when he found 
that among the money taken from the captive the denarii were 
all of equal weight although the different images stamped on them 
showed that they had been coined in the reigns of several emperors. 
Tills influenced him most of all to seek an alliance with the Romans, 
and he accordingly despatched to Rome four ambassadors, of 
whom the chief was Rachia (Rajah) . 

From these it was ascertained that in Taprobane there are 
500 towns, and that there is a harbour facing the south, adjacent to 
the city of Palaesimundus, the most famous city in the island, the 
king’s place of residence, and inhabited by a population of 200,000. 

They stated also that in the interior there is a lake 
xew data called Megisba 375 miles in circuit, and con- 
taining islands which are fertile, but only for 
pasturage. 7 From this lake, they said, there issued two 
rivers, one of which, called Palaesimundus, flows into the harbour 
near the city of the same name by three channels, the narrowest 
of which is five stadia wide, the largest fifteen, while the third, 
called Cydara, has a direction northward towards India. They 
further said that the nearest point in India is a promontory called 
Coliacum, 8 a four days’ sail distant from the island, and 
that midway between them lies the island of the Sun ; 
also that those seas are of a vivid green colour, and that 
a great number of trees grow at the bottom, 9 so that 
the rudders of ships frequently break their crests off. They

saw with astonishment the constellations visible to us — the Greater 
Bear and the Pleiades — as if they were set in a new heaven, and 
they declared that in their country the moon can only be seen 
above the horizon from her eighth to her sixteenth day, 10 while 
they added that Canopus, a large, bright star, illumined their nights. 
But what most of all excited their wonder was that their shadows 
fell towards our part of the world and not to their own, and that the 
sun rose on the left hand and set on the right, and not in the 
opposite direction. 11 They also informed us that the side of their 
island which lies opposite to India is 10,000 stadia in length, and 
runs south-east — that beyond the Hemodi moun- 
tains they look towards the Seres, with whom seres 
they had become acquainted by commerce; 12 
also that the father of Rachia had often gone to their 
country, and that the Seres came to meet their visitors on their 
arrival. These people, they said, exceeded the ordinary stature of 
mankind, and had yellow hair and eyes; the tones of their voice 
were harsh and uncouth, and they could not communicate their 
thoughts by language. In other particulars their accounts of 
them agreed with the reports of our own merchants, who tell us 
that the wares which they deposit near those brought for sale by 
the Seres, on the further bank of a river in their country , 
are removed by them if they are satisfied with the exchange. 13 The 
detestation of luxury could not in any way be better justified 
than by our transporting our thoughts to these regions and reflecting 
what the things are that are sought for to gratify it, from what vast 
distances they are brought, and for what low ends. 

But yet Taprobane even, though isolated by nature from the 
rest of the world, is not exempt from our vices. Even there gold and 
silver are held in esteem. They have a marble which resembles 
tortoiseshell, pearls also and precious stones, and these are all held 
in high honour. Their articles of luxury surpass our own, and they 
have them in great abundance. They asserted that their wealth is 
greater than ours, but acknowledged that we excelled them in 
the art of deriving enjoyment from opulence.

thirty counsellors are provided for him by the people, and no one 
can be condemned to death except by the vote of the majority— the 
person so condemned has, however, the right of appeal to the 
people, in which case a jury of seventy persons is appointed; if 
these should acquit the accused, the thirty counsellors lose all the 
respect they enjoyed, and are subjected to the uttermost disgrace. 
The king dresses like Father Bacchus ; the people like the Arabs. 
The king, if he offend in aught, is condemned to death, 
but no one slays him— all turn their backs upon him, and will not 
communicate with him in any way, not even by speech. Their 
festive occasions are spent in hunting, their favourite game being 
the tiger and the elephant. The land is carefully tilled ; the vine 
is not cultivated, but other fruits are abundant. Great delight is 
taken in fishing, especially in catching turtles, beneath the shells 
of which whole families can be housed, of such vast size are they 
to be found. 14 These people look upon a hundred years as but a 
moderate span of life. Thus much we have learned regarding 
Taprobane.

in after times it was considered an undeniable fact that the 
voyage from Syagrus, a cape in Arabia, 15 reckoned at 1335 miles, 
can be performed by aid of a west wind which is there called 
Hippalus. The age that followed pointed out a shorter route that 
was also safer by making the voyage from the same cape to 
Sigerus, 16 a seaport of India ; and for a long time this route was 
followed until one still shorter was discovered by a merchant, and

India was brought nearer us through the love of gain. So then at 
the present day voyages are made to India every year ; and com- 
panies of archers are carried on board because the Indian seas are 
: infested by pirates ...... If the wind called Hippalus be blowing, 

‘ Muziris, the nearest mart of India, can be reached in forty days. 

It is not a desirable place of call, pirates being in the neighbour- 
hood who occupy a place called Nitrias, and besides it is not well 
supplied with wares for traffic. 17 Ships besides 
anchor at a great distance from the shore, muziris 
and the cargoes have to be landed and 
shipped by employing boats. At the time I was writing this 
Caelobothras was the sovereign of that country. Another more con- 
\ venient harbour of the nation is Neacyndon which is called Becare. 

There Pandion used to reign, dwelling at a great distance from 
the mart, in a town in the interior of the country called Modura. 

< The district from which pepper is carried down to Becare in 

* canoes is called Cottonara. 18 None of these names of nations, 

ports, and cities are to be found in any of the former writers — 
from which it appears that the names (stations) of the places are 
| changed. Travellers sail back from India in the beginning of the 

Egyptian month Tybis — our December — or at all events before the 
8th day of the Egyptian month Meehir, that is before the Ides of 
January. In this way they can go and return the same year. 
They sail from India with a south-east wind, and on entering the 
Red Sea catch the south-west or south.

V. THE PERIPLUS OF THE ERYTHRAEAN SEA 

45. Now the whole country of India has very many rivers, and 
very great ebb and flow of the tides ; increasing at the new moon, 

and at the full moon for three days, and falling 
barygaza off during the intervening days of the moon. 

But about Barygaza it is much greater, so 
that the bottom is suddenly seen, and now parts of the 
dry land are sea, and now it is dry where ships were sailing just 
before ; and the rivers under the inrush of the flood tide, 1 when the 
whole force of the sea is directed against them, are driven upwards 
more strongly against their natural current, for many stadia. 

46. For this reason entrance and departure of vessels is very 
dangerous to those who are inexperienced or who come to this 
market-town for the first time. For the rush of waters at the 

incoming tide is irresistible, and the anchors 
tides cannot hold against it ; so that large ships are 

caught up by the force of it, turned broadside 
on through the speed of the current, and so driven on the shoals 
and wrecked ; and smaller boats are overturned ; and those that 
have been turned aside among the channels by the receding waters 
at the ebb, are left on their sides, and if not held on an even keel 
by props, the flood tide comes upon them suddenly and under the 
first head of the current they are filled with water. For there is 
so great force in the rush of the sea at the new moon, especially 
during the flood tide at night, that if you begin the entrance at the 
moment when the waters are still, on the instant there is borne 
to you at the mouth of the river, a noise like the cries of an army 
heard from afar ; and very soon the sea itself comes rushing in 
over the shoals with a hoarse roar. 

47. The country inland from Barygaza is inhabited by numer- 
ous tribes, such as the Arattii, the Arachosii, the Gandaraei 2 and 
the people of Poclais, 3 in which is Bucephalus Alexandria. Above 

1. * According to the Imp. Gaz. of India , IX, 297, high spring tides in the 
Gulf of Cambay rise and fall as much as 33 feet, and run at a velocity of 
6 to 7 knots an hour. Ordinary tides reach 25 feet, at 4% to 6 knots. The 
inevitable damage to shipping, under such difficulties, was the cause of the 
desertion of the Cambay ports for Surat, and, more recently, Bombay.’—

their own king. And Alexander, setting out from these parts, 
penetrated to the Ganges, 4 leaving aside Damirica and the southern 
part of India ; and to the present day ancient drachmae are current 
in Barygaza, coming from this country, bearing inscriptions in 
Greek letters, and the devices of those who reigned after Alexander, 
Apollodotus and Menander. 

48. Inland from this place and to the east, is the city called 
Ozene, 5 formerly a royal capital ; from this place are brought down 
all things needed for the welfare of the country about Barygaza, 
and many things for our trade : agate and carnelian, Indian muslins 
and mallow cloth, and much ordinary cloth. Through this same 
region and from the upper country is brought the spikenard that

line from north to south ; and so this region is called Dachinabades, 
for dachanos in the language of the natives means “ south. 3 ’ The 
inland country back from the coast toward the east 
deccan comprises many desert regions and great moun- 

tains ; and all kinds of wild beasts— leopards, 
tigers, elephants, enormous serpents, hyenas, and baboons 
of many sorts ; and many populous nations, as far as the Ganges. 

51. Among the market-towns of Dachinabades there are two 
of special importance ; Paethana, 10 distant about twenty days’ 

journey south from Barygaza ; beyond which, 
towns about ten days’ journey east, there is another 

very great city, Tagara. 11 There are brought 
down to Barygaza from these places by wagons and through great 
tracts without roads, from Paethana carnelian in great quantity, 
and from Tagara much common cloth, all kinds of muslins and 
mallow cloth, and other merchandise brought there locally from 
the regions along the sea-coast. And the whole course to the end 
of Damirica is seven thousand stadia ; but the distance is greater to 
the Coast Country.

Nelcynda is distant from Muziris by river and sea about five

observing the location of the ports and the con-

his course straight across the ocean. For at 
the same time when with us the Etesian winds are blowing,

Pearl-fishing 

The Indian pearl-oyster (I have already spoken of the 
Erythraean kind) is caught in the following manner. There is a 
city which a man of royal extraction called Soras 1 governed at the 
time when Eukratides governed the Baktrians, 2 and the name of 
that city Is Perimuda. It is inhabited by a race of fish-eaters who 
are said to go off with nets and catch the kind of oysters mention- 
ed, in a great bay by which a vast extent of the coast is indented. 
It is said that the pearl grows upon a shell like that of a large 
mussel, and that the oysters swim in great shoals, and have leaders, 
just as bees in their hives have their queen-bees. I learn further 
that the leader is bigger and more beautifully coloured than the 
others, and that in consequence the divers have a keen struggle in 
the depths which of them shall catch him, since when he is taken 
they catch also the entire shoal, now left, so to speak, forlorn and 
leaderless, so that it stirs not, and, like a flock of sheep that has 
lost its shepherd, no longer moves forward against any incipient 
danger. As long, however, as the leader escapes and skilfully 
evades capture, he guides their movements and upholds discipline. 
Such as are caught are put into tubs to decay, and when the flesh 
has rotted and run off nothing is left but the round pebble. The 
best sort of pearl is the Indian and that of the Red Sea. It is pro- 
duced also in the Western Ocean where the island of Britain is. 
This sort seems to be of a yellowish colour, like gold, while its 
lustre is dull and dusky. Juba tells us that the pearl is produced 
in the straits of the Bosporus and is inferior to the British, and 
not for a moment to be compared with the Indian and Red Sea 
kind. That which is obtained in the interior of India is said 
not to have the proper characteristics, but to be a rock crystal.

Sailing-course of the Left-hand side of the Arabian Gulf and 
Erythraean Sea and of the whole Indian Ocean. 

On the left or Asiatic side the location of continent and seas 
is as follows. It is understood here again that it is best to state 
general names before local, and to give the relation of countries. 
So if you navigate the Arabian Gulf, and hold the continent on the 
left, you come first to Arabia Felix, which extends along 
the whole Arabian Gulf as far as the aforesaid Arabian Strait. 
Beyond the narrows of the Arabian Gulf follows the 
Erythraean Sea, and if you navigate along it and hold 
the continent on the left you come to the well-known 
people of the Arabs, who inhabit all this continent. In 
this part of the sea is also the people of the Homerites, 
settled on the land of the Arabs and holding as far as the beginning 
of the Indian Ocean. Then beyond the Erythraean Sea follows the

Sailing-course of the island of Taprohana 

Opposite to the cape of India which is called Cory, is the cape of 
the island of Taprohana called Boreum. 9 The island of Taprohana 
was formerly called Falaesimundu, but now Salica. This cape of 
the island, which we said is called Boreum, opposite to Cape Cory, 
is distant from the eastern horizon 26,460 stadia, from the western 
61,626 stadia, while on the south it is at a distance of 6,350 stadia 
north from the equator. 

(The local description is lacking). 

Beyond the promontory of Boreum the whole description and 
sailing-course of the island of Taprohana is as follows : the length 
through the diameter is 9,500 stadia, the width 7,500 stadia. It has 
13 peoples or satrapies, 22 notable cities and market-towns, 2 nota- 
ble mountains, 5 notable rivers, 8 notable capes, 4 notable ports, 
2 great bays, 1 great coast-line. The whole sailing course of the 
island of Taprobana is 26,385 stadia. We have said enough about 
the island of Taprobana. Let us return to the sailing-course along 
India within the Ganges.

Sailing-course of the Gangetic Bay 

From this Point of Departure 10 (for those bound to Chryse) 
begins the very great bay called Gangetic into the head of which 
empties the river Ganges, discharging through five mouths ; which, 
as we have said, is the boundary between India within the Ganges 
and India beyond the Ganges.

The length of India within the river Ganges, where it extends 
the greatest, from the fifth mouth of the river Ganges, which is 
called Antibole, to the port of Naustathmus situated on the gulf 
of Canthi, is 18,290 stadia ; and the width from the cape of the 
Point of Departure, so-called, to the sources of the river Ganges 
is 13,000 stadia. It has 54 peoples or satrapies, 216 notable cities 
and towns and market-towns, 6 notable mountains, 23 notable 
rivers, 2 notable capes, 1 .notable port, 5 notable bays, 12 notable

A. Daksina and the Pigeon Monastery 

1 There is a country named Daksina 1 where there is a monas- 
tery (dedicated to) the bygone Kasyapa Buddha, and which has 
been hewn out from a large hill of rock. It consists in all of five 
storeys ; — the lowest, having the form of an elephant, with 500 
apartments in the rock ; the second, having the form of a lion, with 
400 apartments; the third, having the form of a horse, with 300 
apartments ; the fourth, having the form of an ox, with 200 apart- 
ments ; and the fifth, having the form of a pigeon, with 100 -apart- 
ments. At the very top there is a spring, the water of which, 
always in front of the apartments in the rock, goes round among 
the rooms, now circling, now curving, till in this way it arrives at 
the lowest storey, having followed the shape of the structure, and 
flows out there at the door. Everywhere in the apartments of the 
monks, the rock has been pierced so as to form windows for the 
admission of light, so that they are all bright, without any being 
left in darkness. At the four corners of the (tiers of) apartments, 
the rock has been hewn so as to form steps for ascending to the 
top (of each). The men of the present day, being of small size, 
and going up step by step, manage to get to the top ; but in a for- 
mer age they did so at one step. Because of this, the monastery 
is called Paravata, that being the Indian name for a pigeon. There 
are always Arhats residing in it. 

The country about is (a tract of) uncultivated hillocks, with- 
out inhabitants. At a very long distance from the hill there are 
villages, where the people all have bad and erroneous views, and 
do not know the Sramanas of the Law of Buddha, Brahmanas, 
or (devotees of) any of the other and different schools. The peo- 
ple of that country are constantly seeing men on the wing, who 
come and enter this monastery. On one occasion, when devotees 
of various countries came to perform their worship at it, the peo- 
ple of those villages said to them, * Why do you not fly ? The 
devotees whom we have seen hereabouts all fly and the strangers

The kingdom of Daksina is out of the way, and perilous to 
traverse. There are difficulties in connection with the roads ; but 
those who know how to manage such difficulties and wish to pro-

them to the king. He will then send men to escort them. These 
will (at different stages) pass them over to others, who will show 
them the shortest routes. Fa-hien, however, was after all unable 
to go there ; but having received the (above) accounts from men 
of the country, he has narrated them.. 1 ' '

B. Tamali'pti and Ceylon 

Following the course of the Ganges, and descending eastwards 
for eighteen yojanas, he found on the southern bank the great 
kingdom of Campa 2 with topes reared at the places where Buddha 
walked in meditation by his vihara, and where he and the three 
Buddhas, his predecessors sat. There were monks residing at them 
all. Continuing his journey east for nearly fifty yojanas, he came 
to the country of Tamalipti, 3 (the capital of which is) a sea-port. 
In the country there are twenty-two 4 monasteries, at all of which 
there are monks residing. The Law of Buddha is also flourishing 
in it. Here Fa-hien stayed two years, writing out his Sutras, and , 
drawing pictures of images. 

After this he embarked in a large merchant-vessel, and went 
floating over the sea to the south-west. It was the beginning of 
winter, and the wind was favourable ; and, after fourteen days, 
sailing day and night, they came to the country of Singhala, 5 The

C. Ceylon 

The kingdom is on a large island, extending from east to west 
fifty yojanas, and from north to south thirty. Left and right from 
it there are as many as 100 small islands, distant from one another, 
ten, twenty, or even 200 li ; but all subject to the large island. 
Most of them produce pearls and precious stones of various kinds ; 
there is one which produces the pure and brilliant pearl, 6 an island 
which would form a square of about ten li The king employs 
men to watch and protect it, and requires three out of every ten 
such pearls, which the collectors find. The country originally had 
no human inhabitants, 7 but was occupied only by spirits and 
nagas, with which merchants of various countries carried on a 
trade. When the trafficking was taking place, the spirits did not 
show themselves. They simply set forth their precious commodi- 
ties, with labels of the price attached to them ; while the merchants 
made their purchases according to the price ; and took the things 
away. 8 

Through the coming and going of the merchants (in this way) , 
when they went away, the people of (their) various countries 
heard how pleasant the land was, and flocked to it in numbers till 
it became a great nation. The (climate) is temperate and attrac- 
tive, without any difference of summer and winter. The vegeta- 
tion is always luxuriant. Cultivation proceeds whenever men 
think fit ; there are no fixed seasons for it.

wicked nagas, by his supernatural power he planted one foot at the

north of the royal city, and the other on the top of a mountain, 10 the 
two being fifteen yojanas apart. Over the foot-print at the north of 
the city the king built a large tope, 400 cubits high, 11 grandly adorn- 
ed with gold and silver, and finished with a combination of all the 
precious substances. By the side of the tope he 
further built a monastery, called the Abhayagiri, 12 abhayagiri 
where there are (now) five thousand monks, vihaea

with those substances and having an appearance of solemn dignity 
which words cannot express. In the palm of the right hand there 
is a priceless pearl. Several years had now elapsed since Fa-Men 
left the land of Han ; the men with whom he had been in intercourse 
had all been of regions strange to him ; his eyes had not rested on 
an old and familiar hill or river, plant or tree ; his fellow tra- 
vellers, moreover, had been separated from him, some by death, 
and others flowing off in different directions ; no face or shadow 
was now with him but his own, and a constant sadness was in his 
heart. Suddenly (one day) , when by the side of this image of jade, 
he saw a merchant presenting as his offering a fan of white silk ; 14 
and the tears of sorrow involuntarily filled his eyes and fell down.

however, from Fa-hien’s narrative, that in the beginning of our fifth cen- 
tury, Buddhism prevailed throughout the island. Davids in the last chapter 
of his ‘Buddhism’ ascribes its introduction to one of As oka’s missions, after 
the Council of Patna, under his son Mahinda, when Tissa, ‘the delight of

A former king of the country had sent to Central India and 
got a slip of the patra tree , 15 which he planted by the side of the 
hall of Buddha, where a tree grew up to the height of about 200 
cubits. 16 As it bent on one side towards the south-east, the king, 
fearing it would fall, propped it with a post 
sacred tree eight or nine spans round. The tiee began to 
grow at the very heart of the prop, where 
it met (the trunk); 18 (a shoot) pierced through the post, and 
went down to the ground, where it entered and formed roots, that 
rose (to the surface) and were about four spans round. Although 
the post was split in the middle, the outer portions kept hold (of 
the shoot), and people did not remove them. Beneath the tree 
there has been built a vihdra , in which there is an image 
(of Buddha) seated, which the monks and commonalty reverence 
and look up to without ever becoming wearied. In the city there 
has been reared also the vilmra of Buddha’s tooth, on which, as 
well as on the other, the seven precious substances have been 
employed. 


The king practises the Brahmanical purifications, and the sin- 
cerity of the faith and reverence of the population inside the city 
are also great. Since the establishment of govern- 
treasure ment in the kingdom there has been no famine or 

scarcity, no revolution or disorder. In the 
treasuries of the monkish communities there are many 


15. This should be the pippala, or bodhidruma, generally spoken of, in 
connection with Buddha, as the Bo tree, , under which he attained to the 
Buddhaship . It is strange our author should have confounded them as he 
seems to do. In what we are told of the tree here, we have, no doubt, 
his account of the planting, growth, and preservation of the famous Bo tree, 
which still exists in Ceylon. It has been stated in a previous note that 
Asoka’s son, Mahinda, went as the apostle of Buddhism to Ceylon. By --and- 
by he sent for his sister Sanghamitta, who had entered the order at the 
same time as himself, and whose help was needed, some of the king's female 
relations having signified their wish to become nuns. On leaving India, 
she took with her a branch of the sacred Bo tree at Buddha Gaya, under 
which Sakyamuni had become Buddha. Of how the tree has grown and 
Still lives we have an account in Davids' ‘Buddhism.' He quotes the words 
of Sir Emerson Tennent, that it is ‘the oldest historical tree in the world;' 
but this must be denied if it be true, as Eitel says, that the tree at Buddha 
Gaya, from which the slip that grew to be this tree was taken more than 
2,000 years ago, is itself still living in its place. We might conclude that 
Fa-hien, when in Ceylon, heard neither of Mahinda nor Sanghamitta.— Legge.

precious stones, and the priceless manis. One of the kings 
(once) entered one of those treasuries, and when he looked all 
round and saw the priceless pearls, his covetous greed was excited, 
and he wished to take them to himself by force. In three days, 
however, he came to himself, and immediately went and bowed his 
head to the ground in the midst of the monks, to show his repent- 
ance of the evil thought. As a sequel to this, he informed the monks 
(of what had been in his mind) , and desired them to make a regula- 
tion that from that day forth the king should not be allowed to 
enter the treasury and see (what it contained) , and that no bhiksu 
should enter it till after he had been in orders for a period of full 
forty years. 

In the city there are many Vaisya elders and So-po , 19 whose 
houses are stately and beautiful. The lanes and 
passages are kept in good order. At the heads preaching 
of the four principal streets there have been 
built preaching halls, where, on the eighth, fourteenth, and 
fifteenth days of the month, they spread carpets, and set forth a 
pulpit, while the monks and the commonalty from all quarters come 
together to hear the Law. The people say that in the kingdom 
there may be altogether sixty thousand monks, 
who get their food from their common stores. FEE]DING OF 
The king, besides, prepares elsewhere in the M0NKS 
city a common supply of food for five or six thousand more. 
When any want, they take their great bowls, and go (to the place 
of distribution), and take as much as the vessels will hold, all 
returning with them full. 

The tooth of Buddha is always brought forth in the middle of 
the third month. Ten days beforehand the king 
grandly caparisons a large elephant, on which he T00 th relic 
mounts a man who can speak distinctly, and is festival 
dressed in royal robes, to beat a large drum, and 
make the following proclamation :

to another ; he cut off a piece of his flesh to ransom the life of a 
dove ; he cut off his head and gave it as an alms ; he gave his body 
to feed a starving tigress ; he grudged not his marrow and brains. 
In many such ways as these did he undergo pain for the sake of 
all living. And so it was, that, having become Buddha, he conti- 
nued in the world for forty-five years, preaching his Law, teaching 
and transforming, so that those who had no rest found rest, and 
the unconverted were converted. When his connection with the 
living was completed, he attained to pari-mrvana (and died). 
Since that event, for 1497 years, the light of the world has gone 
out, 21 and all living beings have had long-continued sadness. 
Behold ! ten days after this, Buddha’s tooth will be brought forth, 
and taken to the Abhayagirivihara. Let all and each, whether 
monks or laics, who wish to amass merit for themselves, make the 
roads smooth and in good condition, grandly adorn the lanes and 
by-ways, and provide abundant store of flowers and incense to be 
used as offerings to it.’ 

When this proclamation is over, the king exhibits, so as to line 
both sides of the road, the five hundred different bodily forms in 
which the Bodhisattva had in the course of his history appeared ; — 
here as Sudana, 22 there as Sama ; 23 now as the king of elephants ; 
and then as a stag or a horse. 24 All these figures are brightly 
coloured and grandly executed, looking as if they were alive. After 
this the tooth of Buddha is brought forth, and is carried along in 
the middle of the road. Everywhere on the way offerings are 
presented to it, and thus it arrives at the hall of Buddha in the 


sum for which a conventional term exists:— according to Chinese calculations 
equal to one followed by seventeen ciphers; according to Thibetan and Sin- 
ghalese, equal to one followed by ninety-seven ciphers. Every Mahakalpa 
consists of four Asahkhyeya-kalpas. Eitel, p. 15. — Legge .

Abhayagiri-vihara. There monks and laics are collected in crowds. 
They burn incense, light lamps, and perform all the prescribed 
services, day and night without ceasing, till ninety days have been 
completed, when (the tooth) is returned to the vihara within the

of ceremonial reverence are observed according to the rules. 

Forty li to the east of the Abhayagiri-vihara there is a hill, with 
a vihara on it, called the Chaitya, 25 where there may be 2,000 monks. 
Among them there is a Sramana of great virtue, named Dharxna- 
gupta, 26 honoured and looked up to by all the kingdom. He has 
lived for more than forty years in an apartment of stone, constantly 
showing such gentleness of heart, that he has brought snakes and 
rats to stop together in the same room, without doing one another 
any harm.

South of the city seven li there is a vihara , called the Maha-

a Sramana of such lofty virtue, and so holy and pure in his observ- 
ance of the disciplinary rules, that the people all surmised that he 
was an Arhat. When he drew near his end, the king came to 
examine into the point ; and having assembled the monks according 
to rule, asked whether the bhiksu had attained to the full degree 
of Wisdom. They answered in the affirmative, saying that he was 
an Arhat. The king accordingly, when he died, buried him after 
the fashion of an Arhat, as the regular rules prescribed. Four or 
five li east from the vihara there was reared a great pile of fire-wood, 
which might be more than thirty cubits square, 27 and the same in

frame, in form like our funeral car, but without the dragons and 
fishes. 28 

At the time of the cremation, the king and the people, in 
multitudes from all quarters, collected together, and presented 
offerings of flowers and incense. While they were following the 
car to the burial-ground, 29 the king himself presented flowers and 
incense. When this was finished, the car was lifted on the pile, all 
over which oil of sweet basil was poured, and then a light was 
applied. While the fire was blazing, every one, with a reverent 
heart, pulled off his upper garment, and threw it, with his feather- 
fan and umbrella, from a distance into the midst of the flames, to 
assist the burning. When the cremation was over, they collected 
and preserved the bones, and proceeded to erect a tope. Fa-hien 
had not arrived in time (to see the distinguished Shaman) alive, 
and only saw his burial. 

At that time the king, 30 who was a sincere believer in the law 
of Buddha and wished to build a new vihdra for the monks, first 
convoked a great assembly. After giving the monks a meal of rice, 
and presenting his offerings (on the occasion), he selected a pair 
of first-rate oxen, the horns of which were grandly decorated with 
gold, silver and the precious substances. A golden plough had been 
provided, and the king himself turned up a furrow on the four 
sides of the ground within which the building was to be. He then 
endowed the community of the monks with the population, fields 
and houses, writing the grant on plates of metal, (to the effect) 
that from that time onwards, from generation to generation, no one 
should venture to annul or alter it.

addition (to his acquisitions in Patna) , succeeded in getting a copy 
of the Vinaya-pitaka of the Mahlsasakah (school); 31 the Dxrgha-

Having obtained these Sanskrit works, he took passage in a large 
merchantman, on board of which there were more than 200 men, 
and to which was attached by a rope a smaller vessel, as a provision 
against damage or injury to the large one from the perils of the 
navigation. With a favourable wind, they proceeded eastwards 
for three days, and then they encountered a great wind. The vessel 
sprang a leak and the water came in. The merchants wished to 
go to the smaller vessel ; but the men on board it, fearing that too 
many would come, cut the connecting rope. The merchants were 
greatly alarmed, feeling their risk of instant death. Afraid that 
the vessel would fill, they took their bulky goods and threw them 
into the water. Fa-hien also took his pitcher (kundika) and 
washing-basin, with some other articles, and cast them into the 
sea ; but fearing that the merchants would cast overboard his books 
and images, he could only think with all his heart of Kwan-she- 
yin, 34 and commit his life to (the protection of) the church of the 
land of Han, (saying in effect) , 4 1 have travelled far in search of

it was stopped, on which the voyage was resumed. On the sea

they were going. The sea was deep and bottomless, and there was 
no place where they could drop anchor and stop. But when the 
sky became clear, they could tell east and west, and (the ship) 
again went forward in the right direction. If she had come on any

IX, GUNAVARMAN : 367-431 A.D. 

Life translated from Kao Seng tchouan of Houei-Kiao, composed 

in A.D. 519, the most complete of the Chinese biographies of 
b this monk. 

Summary : Gunavarman was a ksatriya of the royal line of 

Kashmir. He was remarkably intelligent, and of a thoughtful dis- 
position. He renounced the world at twenty, and became a master 
of the agamas, and earned the name ‘ Master of the Law of Tri- 
pitaka ’ . When he was thirty the king of Kashmir died without 
an heir, and the ministers pressed Gunavarman to rule the king- 
dom, but he declined. He retired to the forest and carefully hid 
himself away from others. 

He then went to Ceylon, developed his religious practices, and 
then went over to Cho-po (Java ?). There the king’s mother had 
a dream regarding him on the night preceding the day of Guna- 
varman’s arrival ; the queen-mother respectfully received him and 
the king became a Buddhist after his mother and the religion spread. 
Gunavarman then wrought many miracles. What follows is a 
translation of the Chinese text from Chavannes’ rendering. 

“ Then, the famous monks of the capital, 1 the sramanas Houei- 
kouan, Houei-is‘ong and others, heard of the good work (of Guna- 
varman) and thought of telling their sovereign 
about it ; in the ninth month of the first year invited 
Yuan-kia (424) , they spoke out their ideas in an in- ro china 
terview with the emperor Wen, and proposed that 
they would go and ask Gunavarman to come (to China). The 
emperor then issued a decree requiring the prefect of Kiao tcheou 
(Hanoi) to take steps for the transport by boat of (Houei-)Kouan 
and his colleagues ; he sent at the same time the sramanas 
Fa-tchang, Tao-Tcho’ng, Tao-tsiun and others that they might go 
down there and request (Gunavarman to come) ; they carried also 
(imperial) letters to Gunavarman and the king of Cho-po (Java ?), 
Po-to-kia, 2 expressing a lively desire to see Gunavarman come to 
the Song territory and spread the religious teaching there. Guna- 
varman, considering it important to spread the holy doctrine, had 
no fear of travel, and before the imperial envoys came, he had 
already embarked on the boat of a merchant, the Hindu Nandi,

with the intention of going to a small kingdom ; but he found a 
favourable wind, and arrived at Kouang-teheou (Canton). This 
explains the following passage in his posthumous writing : 1 When 
I was already en route , I was carried by the wind, and I arrived in 
the Song territory \ The emperor Wen, learning that Gunavarman 
had reached (the province of) Nan-hai, issued a new decree requir- 
ing the prefects and governors to see that Gunavarman was supplied 
with provisions and sent to the capital. 

“ The route passed Che-hing ; 3 Gunavarman spent over a year 
there. At Che-hing is the mountain Hou-che, a solitary eminence 
of which the peaks are scarped and abrupt ; 
at che-hing Gunavarman said that it resembled the Grdhra- 
kuta, and they changed its name and called 
it the Peak of the Vulture ; outside the temple on this mountain, 
there was a hall of dhydna in a separate spot ; this hall was many 
li distant from the temple, and no noise was heard there ; yet, 
when the Ghanta began to resound Gunavarman was already 
there ; if he came in the rain, he was not wet ; if he walked in the 
mire, he was not soiled. There was then no one, cleric or lay- 
man, that did not feel an increasing and respectful admiration for 
him. 

“ In the temple was the hall Pao-yue (ratnacandra) . On the 
northern wall of this hall, Gunavarman painted with his own hand 
the image of Lo~yun (Rahula) and the scene of Dipankara and the 
young student spreading his hair . 4 When the figures were 
completed, as the evening came on, they gave out a lustre which 
ceased only after a long time. 

“ The prefect of Che-hing, T’sai Mao-tche evinced the greatest 
admiration for Gunavarman ; later, when he was at the point of 
death, Gunavarman came in person to see him, and comforted him 
by preaching the law. Subsequently, a relation (of T’sai Mao-tche) 
saw him in a dream with a multitude of the clergy expounding the 
law in a temple ; that surely was an effect produced by the force 
of the conversion made by Gunavarman. 

u This mountain was once infested by a large number of tigers; 
from the time Gunavarman settled there, he went by day and 
returned by night, and if now and then he met a tiger, he touched 
his head with his baton, stroked him and then went away ; then the 
travellers who went by the mountains and on the rivers found no

obstacle to their going and coming. Among them seven or eight 
out of ten were touched by this kindness and became converted. 

44 Once Gunavarman was engaged in a meditation in a 
separate hall from which he did not come out for many successive 
days. The clerics of the temple sent a sramanera 
to observe him ; he saw a white lion standing erect miracles 
alongside of a column ; everywhere in the 
chamber bloomed the flowers of the blue lotus. The 
sramanera was frightened and raised a loud cry and entered (the 
hall) to chase the lion ; but then there was only a void, and nothing 
more to be seen. Many were the miracles of this unparalleled 
nature that Gunavarman wrought. 

“Meanwhile the emperor Wen reiterated to (Houei-) Kouan 
and his colleagues, the order to request Gunavarman once more to 
come at once. Then Gunavarman proceeded by boat to the capital 
and reached Kien-ye (Nanking) in the first 
month of the eighth year Yuan-kia (431) . at hanking 
The emperor Wen went out to receive him 
and made solicitous enquiries of him. He (Emperor) profited by 
the occasion and put him this question : 4 1, your disciple, have a 
constant desire to observe the prohibitions and to abstain from 
killing ; but as I have necessarily to subordinate my sentiments to 
those of others, I am unable to give effect to my intentions. O, 
Master of the Law, since you have not found 10,000 li too great a 
distance to traverse for converting this kingdom, what will be your 
instruction to me ? * Gunavarman answered : 4 Wisdom is in the 

heart, not in acts ; religion originates in yourself and not from 
others. Besides, kings and ordinary men have entirely different 
codes of conduct ; for the ordinary man, his person is of little 
value and his reputation is inconsiderable ; his commands are not 
feared ; if he does not conquer himself and lead a life of asceticism, 
what is he good for ? As for the sovereign, the country bounded 
by the four seas is his house ; the thousands of the people, his 
children ; when he speaks a good word, all men and women 
rejoice ; when he conducts an excellent government, men and gods 
are reconciled thereby ; punishments no longer shorten lives ; 
forced labour no more exhausts the strength (of the people) ; it 
causes the wind and rain to come in proper time, winter and summer 
to correspond to their proper periods, all sorts of cereals 
to increase in abundance, the mulberry and the hemp to flourish. 
To observe abstinence in this manner, is an abstinence which Is 
also lofty ; to shun killing likewise, is a benevolence which is also 
manifold. How could it be possible by curtailing the nourishment

of half a day or by saving the life of some one animal for one to 
find that he has accomplished this noble and salutary work ? ” The 
emperor then softly struck the table and said with a sigh : The 

laity go wrong in ultimate principles ; the clergy embarrass themsel- 
ves in the doctrine of what is near at hand. Those who go astray 
on ultimate principles hold empty discourses on absolute wisdom ; 
those that embarrass themselves in a doctrine of what is near at 
hand allow themselves to be fettered by the written rules. But 
regarding the language you employ, Master of the Law, we can 
well say that it is that of an open and intelligent man ; it is worth 
while for all to talk with you about what concerns heaven and 
earth \ Then he ordered that Gunavarman should reside in the 
temple Tche-houan (Jetavana vihara) , and he provided liberally 
for his maintenance ; the dukes, kings and all persons of distinction 
paid their respects to him. 

“Then Gunavarman began to expound in this temple the 
Saddharmapundanka siitra and the Dasabhumi sutra . On days when 
he started to preach, sedan chairs and canopies 
preacher of officials blocked the road ; the spectators who 

went there and came back in succession 
rubbed shoulders with one another and walked close on one 
another’s heels. Gunavarman had marvellous natural resources ; 
his admirable dialectic was divinely eminent ; sometimes he had 
recourse to an interpreter, and, by a series of dialectical discussions, 
obscure points became clear. 

“Afterwards, Houei-yi, (monk) of the temple Tche-houan 
asked him to publish (the book called) P c ou-sa 
writer chan hie ; (Gunavarman) began by issuing 

twenty-eight sections of it ; later, one of his 
disciples published for him two sections, thus making a total 
of thirty sections. But before the work was recopied, the sections 
comprising the Prefaces and the Prohibitions were lost ; that is why 
there are still two different texts (of the work). 5 6 This work was 
also called P c ou-sa hie ti . 

“ Earlier, in the third year Yuan-Kia (426) , the prefect of Sin 
tchou, Wang Tchong-to, while he was at Pong-tcheng , had request- 
ed the foreigner I-che-po-lo (Isvara) to translate the work called 
Tsa-sin f but when the section on Choice was reached, (Isvara) had

to stop the work on account of some difficulty. Now Gunavarman 
was requested again to translate and publish the last sections (of 
this work) which formed thirteen chapters. We get a total of 
twenty-six chapters if we add the earlier publications, viz., the Sseu 
fen kie-mo, yeou-p‘o-sai won kie lio louen, the yeou-p'o-sai 
eul che eul kie. In all these translations, the style and the sense 
were perfect and exact ; there was not the least difference between 
the Sanskrit and the Chinese. 

“ Meanwhile, the nuns of the temple Ying-fou viz., Houei-kuo, 
Tsing-yin and others , 7 addressed to Gunavarman a request in these 
terms : 4 It is six years since eight nuns from 
Ceylon came to the Capital. There have been nuns 
no nuns before in the territory of the Song. 

Where shall we find (the rules for) the second assembly 8 
receiving the prohibitions ? We fear that the section 
on prohibitions is not complete . 5 Gunavarman answered them : 

4 The system of prohibitions was promulgated at first with the 
assembly of the great monks in view ; supposing that a case other 
than that of the original type presents itself, nothing prevents the 
reception of the prohibitions, being due to love of religion.’ The 
nuns were still afraid that they were not of the prescribed age, 
and desired at once to receive (the prohibitions) afresh. Guna- 
varman told them : 4 Very well ! if truly you desire to increase 

the lustre (of religious life), that will aid the company greatly to 
enjoy itself (punyanumodana) . Only the nuns of the western land 
are also not of the prescribed age ; besides, the number of ten 
persons has not been reached .’ 9 He then induced them to study 
the language of the Song (Chinese), and, on the other hand, with 
a notable from the Western countries as intermediary, he requested 
that more nuns from the foreign land should come to make up the 
number ten . 10

“ During that year, in summer, Gunavarman passed the season 
of retreat in the lower temple of Ting-lin. There were then 
devoted people who gathered flowers for spreading them on the 
mats ; only the colours of the flowers placed in the spot where 
Gunavarman was seated increased in freshness ; all the people 
adored him as a saint. When summer came to an end, he returned 
to the temple Tche-houan (Jetavana vihara) . The same year, on 
the twenty-eighth day of the ninth month, before the mid-day meal 
was finished, he got up first and went back to his chamber. His

called ho-tse, similar to talc (yim-moo), the colour of which was 
yellowish red (tse, reddish blue) ; if it is divided, it disperses like 
the wings of the cricket, if it is heaped up, on the other hand, it 
becomes compact, like threads of silk strongly woven. There 
were diamonds resembling amethysts (tse-shih-ying) . When puri-

used to cut Jasper (yu stone) . There were also tortoise-shell

also a variety of odoriferous plants, yuh-kin, sugar-canes, and all

XL A MIRROR FROM WESTERN INDIA

poet, painter. “ The story connected in this report with the 
crystal mirror is a somewhat abrupt and incomplete version of the 
well-known legend of the Diamond Valley, the oldest hitherto

Epiphanius, Bishop of Constantia in Cyprus (circa 315-403)”

f “ A large junk of Fu-nan which had hailed from western India 
arrived (in China) and offered for sale a mirror of a peculiar 
variety of rock-crystal, 1 one foot and four inches across its surface, 
and forty catties in weight. It was pure white and transparent 
on the surface and in the interior, and displayed many-coloured 
things on its obverse. When held against the light and examined, 
its substance was not discernible. 2 On inquiry for the price, it 
was given at a million strings of copper coins. The Emperor 
ordered the officials to raise this sum, but the treasury did not hold 
enough. Those traders said, 'This mirror is due to the action 
of the Devaraja of the Rupadhatu. On felicitous and joyful 
occasions, he causes the trees of the gods to pour down a shower 
of precious stones, and the mountains receive them. The moun- 
tains conceal and seize the stones, so that they are difficult 
to obtain. The flesh of big beasts is cast into the mountains ; and 


1. Pauthier who first called attention to this text explained p*o-B rightly 
as ‘rock-crystal.’ Pelliot (BEFEO, iii, p. 283) adopts the usual meaning 
‘glass’ though he allows its connection with Sphatika (Skt.) . It cannot be 
glass, for (1) the story of the Diamond valley makes it a matter of precious 
stones, as also the high price; (2) real glass mirrors were not yet invented 
in the West and could not have been known in India and Fu-nan in the 
sixth century. They did not come up in Europe before the latter half of 
the 13th century. In later times p‘o-U did mean glass.— Laufer (abridged). 

2. Hirth’s translation of this sentence is based on an incomplete text and 
renders it unintelligible. “As they were not acquainted with the complete 
text, as handed down in Tai ping yii lan, Hirth and Rockhill understand 
that the junks of Fu-nan habitually sell such mirrors to the Chinese. Our 
story renders it clear that only an isolated instance comes into question, 
and that this particular, unusual mirror could not even be disposed of in 
China. The Liang se hung tse ki is not a work on commercial geography 
summarising general data, but is a story-book narrating specific events. 
We have in the present case not a description, but a narrative.” — Laufer.

XII. COSMAS 


(A) A description of Indian Animals 
i. The Rhinoceros 

"This animal is called the rhinoceros from having horns upon 
its snout. When it is wandering about, the horns are mobile, but 
when it sees anything which excites its rage, it stiffens them, and 
they become so rigid that they are strong enough to tear up even 
trees by the roots — those especially which come in the way of the 
front horn. The eyes are fixed low down about the jaws. It is 
altogether an animal much to be dreaded, and in this respect so 
far a contrast to the elephant. Its feet and its hide, however, 
closely resemble those of that animal. The hide when dried is four 
fingers thick, and this is sometimes used instead of iron in ploughs 
for tilling the land. The Ethiopians in their language call the 
rhinoceros Aron, or Harisi, prefixing the rough breathing to the 
alpha of the latter word, and adding risi to it in order that by the 
arou they may designate the animal and by the arisi , £ ploughing/ 
giving it this name from its shape about the nostrils, as well as 
from the use to which its hide is applied. I have seen in Ethiopia, 
when I was standing at a distance off, a living rhinoceros and I have 
seen also the hide of a dead one stuffed with chaff, and set up in 
the royal palace, and of this the picture I have drawn is an exact 
copy. 1 

ii. The Taurelaphos, the Bull-stag or Ox-deer 

The taurelaphos is an animal found in India and in Ethiopia. 
But the Indian ones are tame, and gentle and the people use them 
for transporting pepper and other stuffs packed in saddle-bags. 
They supply the , natives with milk and butter. Moreover we eat 
their flesh, the Christians killing them by cutting their throats, and 
the Pagans by knocking them on the head. The Ethiopian ox- 
deer, unlike the Indian, are wild and untamable.

Hi The Agriobous or Wild Ox 

This is an animal 2 3 of great size and belongs to India, and from 
it is got what is called the toupha ? wherewith commanders deco- 
rate their horses and their banners when taking the field. It is 
said of this animal that if its tail be caught by a tree, it no longer 
stoops but stands erect, from its reluctance to lose even a single 
hair. The natives thereupon come up and cut off its tail, and then 
it scuttles away completely docked of this appendage. Such is the 
nature of this animal 

— Ancient Ind pp. 157-8. 

iv. The Moschus or Musk-deer 

The small animal, 4 again, is the Moschus, called in the native 
tongue Kastouri Those who hunt it pierce it with arrows and 
having tied up the blood collected at the navel 5 they cut it away. 
For this is the part which has the pleasant fragrance known to us 
by the name of musk. The men then cast away the rest of the 
carcase.

This is a picture of the tree which produces pepper, each sepa-

tendrils of the vine, around some tall tree that does not itself bear 
fruit. Each of the clusters is enveloped within a couple of leaves. 
It is of a deep green colour like that of rue.

The other tree (represented) is that which bears what are 
called argellia , that is, the large Indian nuts. It differs in no way 
from the date palm, except in being of greater height and thickness, 
and in having larger branches. It bears not more than two or three 
fiower-spathes, each having as many nuts. Their taste is quite 
sweet and pleasant, like that of green nuts. The nut is at first 
full of a delicious liquid which the Indians therefore drink instead

the fruit is gathered at maturity, then so long as it keeps fresh, the 
liquid in contact with shell hardens upon It progressively, while 
the liquid in the centre retains its fluidity until it entirely fails. 
If, however, it be kept too long the fruit becomes rancid and unfit 
for human food.

(C) Concerning the Island of Taprobane — Ceylon 

This is a large oceanic island lying in the Indian sea. Among 
the Indians it goes by the name of Sielediba, but the Pagans call it 
Taprobane, wherein is found the stone hyacinth. It lies farther away 
than the pepper country. Around it there is a great number of small 
islands, 7 all of them having fresh water and cocoanut trees. They 
nearly all have deep water close up to them. The great island, as 
the natives allege, has a length of three hundred gandiaP and a 
breadth of as many — that is of nine hundred miles. There are two 
kings in the island who are at feud with each other. The one 
possesses the hyacinth, and the other the rest of the island wherein 
are the port and the emporium of trade. The emporium is one 
much resorted to by the people in those parts. 9 The island has 
also a church of Persian Christians who have settled there, and a 
Presbyter who is appointed from Persia, and a Deacon and a com- 
plete ecclesiastical ritual. 10 The natives and their kings are, how- 
ever, heathens in religion. In this island they have many temples, 
and in one situated on an eminence is a single hyacinth as big as a 
large pine-cone, the colour of fire and flashing from a distance, es- 
pecially when the sunbeams play around it — a matchless sight, 11 
As its position is central, the island is a great resort of ships from

the coco-palm toddy. For sura is the name applied on the Malabar coast to

for tender cocoanut.

all parts of India, and from Persia and Ethiopia, and in like man- 
ner it despatches many of its own to foreign ports. And from the 
inner countries , 12 I mean China and other marts 
in that direction, it receives silks, aloes, clovewood, maritime 
sandalwood, and their other products, and these it TRADE 
again passes on to the outer ports, I mean to 
Male , 13 where pepper grows, and to Kalliana 14 where copper is 
produced and sesame wood and materials for dress ; for it is also 
a great mart of trade ; and to Sindu also, where musk or castor is 
got, as well as Androstachus, (?) and to Persia and the Homerite 
country, and to Adule . 15 Receiving in return the traffic of these 
marts, and transmitting it to the inner ports, the island exports to 
each of these at the same time her own products. Sindu 
is the frontier country of India for the river Indus, that is, the 
Phison, which empties itself into the Persian Gulf, separates Persia 
from India. The following are the most famous commercial marts 
in India : Sindus, Orrhotha , 10 Kalliana, Sibor , 17 Male which has 
five marts that export pepper : Parti, Mangarouth 18 Salopatana, 
Nalopatana, Poudopatana . 19 Then out in the ocean, at the distance 
of five days and nights from the mainland, lies Selediba, that is 
Taprobane. Then, again, farther away and on the mainland is 
the mart Marallo, which exports chank shells, then comes Kaber 20 
which exports alabandenum, then next is the clove country, then 
China, which produces silk, beyond which there is no other land, 
for the ocean encircles it on the east. 

Sielediba being thus in a central position with reference to the 
Indies, and possessing the hyacinth, receives wares from all 
trading marts and again distributes them over the world, and thus 
becomes a great emporium. Now once upon a time one of our 
countrymen engaged in commerce and called Sopater who to our 
knowledge died five and thirty years ago, came on business to the 
island of Taprobane, where also, it so happened, a ship from Persia

came to moorings. So the men from Adule, among whom was 
Sopater, disembarked, as did likewise the men from Persia, among 
whom there was one of advanced age. Then in accordance with 
the custom of the place, the magistrates and the custom-house offi- 
cials received them and brought them to the king. The king, having 
admitted them to his presence and received their obeisances, re- 
quested them to be seated. Then he asked them : How fares it 

with the countries you come from, and how are things moving 
there ? To this they replied : Things are going 
PERSIAN AND on all very well. Afterwards, when in the course of 

homan conversation, the king inquired : Which of your res- 

pective kings is the greater and the more power- 
ful ? the Persian, who was in haste to speak first, replied : Our 
king is both more powerful and is greater and richer, and is 
King of Kings, and he can do whatever he pleases. Sopater, on the 
other hand, remained silent. So the king asked : Have you, 
Roman , 21 nothing to say ? What have I to say, he rejoined, when 
he there has said these things ? If you wish to ascertain the truth, 
you have both the kings here. Examine each and you will see 
which of them is the more illustrious and the more powerful. On 
hearing this the king was surprised at what he said, and 
asked : How, have I both the kings here ? The other then replied : 
You have the money of both — the current coin of the one and the 
drachma of the other, that is, the miliarision . 22 Examine the image 
of each, and you will see the truth. The king thanked the man, 
and assenting to his proposal, ordered both coins to be produced. 
Then the Roman coin had a good ring, and was bright and finely 
shaped, for choice pieces of this nature are exported thither. But 
the miliarision, was silver and, to say in a word all that need be 
said, was not to be compared with the gold piece. The king having 
closely examined each of the coins both on the obverse and reverse 
side, bestowed all manner of praise on the Roman coin and said : 
Truly the Romans are splendid men and powerful, and possessed of 
great good sense. He therefore commanded Sopater to be greatly 
honoured, and having mounted him on his elephant, he conducted

him round the whole city with drums beating and many marks of 
honour. All this was told us by Sopater himself as well as by his 
companions, who had gone with him to that island from Adule . 23 
This occurrence, they assured me, overwhelmed the Persian with 
shame. 

Between the famous marts already mentioned, there are many 
others, both on the coast and in the interior, and the country has 
a vast area. The regions higher up, that is, farther north than 
India, are occupied by the White Huns, whose 
king, called Gollas , 24 when going to war is gollas 
said to take with him no fewer than two 
thousand elephants and much cavalry. Within his empire is in- 
cluded India, from which he extracts tribute. Once on a time, 
this king, as the story goes, wished to sack an Indian city in the 
interior — one that was surrounded by water and was thus protected 
from assault. He encamped all around it for a considerable time, 
until all the water had been drunk up by his elephants, his horses, 
and his soldiery. Having then crossed over to the city on dry land, 
he was able to capture it. This people highly prize the emerald 
stone and wear it when set in a crown. For the Ethiopians, who 
traffic with the Blemmyes 25 in Ethiopia, carry this same stone into 
India, and with the price they obtain make purchases of the most 
beautiful articles. All these particulars I have related and describ- 
ed partly from what fell under my observation, and partly as I 
learned them after most careful inquiry when I was in the neigh- 
bourhood of the places I have mentioned. 

The kings of various parts of India possess elephants, as for 
instance the kings of Orrotha, and Kalliana, and Sindu and Sibor 
and Male. They have each six hundred, it may 
be, or live hundred more or less. But the king of elephants, 
Sielediba obtains by purchase both the elephants horses 
and horses which he possesses. The price he 
pays for the elephants ‘depends upon the number of cubits they 
reach in height. For the height is measured from the ground in 
cubits, and the price is reckoned at so many pieces of money for 
each cubit, say fifty or a hundred pieces, or even more. His horses 
again are imported from Persia, and the traders from whom he buys

them he exempts from the payment of custom house dues. But 
the kings of the mainland catch their elephants as they roam 
about at large, and having tamed them, employ them in war. They 
often set elephants to fight against each other in the presence of the 
king. They separate the two combatants by means of a large 
cross-beam of wood fastened to other two beams standing upright 
and reaching up to their breasts. A number of men are stationed 
on this and that side to prevent them meeting in close fight, but 
they instigate them to attack each other, and then 
elephant the beasts becoming enraged use their trunks to 

eights belabour each other with blows till one or other of 

them gives in. The tusks of the Indian elephants 
are not large, but should they be so the Indians shorten them with 
a saw so that the weight may not encumber them when in action. 
The Ethiopians again have not the art of taming elephants, but 
when the king happens to wish to have one or two for show, they 
catch young ones and put them under training. Now they are quite 
plentiful in Ethiopia, and their tusks being large are exported by 
sea from that country into India and Persia and the Homerite 
country and the Roman dominion. These facts I have recorded 
on the testimony of others.

XIIL C. 550-800 A.D. (MA TWAN LIN) 

Ma Twan Lin , a mediaeval Chinese historian, brought together 
in a Cyclopaedia all the ancient authorities known to him, and the 
extract given below may well be taken to apply to South India 
about the second half of the sixth century or earlier from its posi- 
tion in the work of Ma. 

On the condition of South India 

On the west, India carries on a considerable commerce by sea 
with Ta-tsin (the eastern Roman empire), the An-se (or Asae, 
Syrians) ; some of the Indians come as far as Foo-nan and Keaou- 
che (Tonquin), to traffic in coral necklaces and pearls of inferior 
quality (or which only resemble pearls — san-kari) . These mer- 
chants are accustomed to dispense with books of accounts (in their 
commercial transactions) . Teeth (elephants’ or rhinoceros 5 ?) and 
shells form their articles of exchange. They have men very skilful 
in magical arts. The greatest mark of respect which a wife can show 
towards her husband is to kiss his feet and embrace his knees : 
this is the most energetic and persuasive demonstration of the 
interior sentiments. In their houses, they have young girls who 
dance and sing with much skill. Their king and his ministers (ta~ 
chilly ministers about the sovereign) have a vast number of silk 
dresses and fine woollen fabrics. He dresses his hair on the top 
of his head (like the Chinese women) , and the rest of the hair he 
cuts, to make it short. Married men also cut their hair, and pierce 
their ears, to hang valuable rings in them. The general practice 
is to walk on foot. The colour of their dress is mostly white. The 
Indians are timid in battle ; their weapons are the bow and arrows, 
and shield ; they have also (like the Chinese) flying or winged 
ladders ; x and according as the ground will permit, they follow the 
rules of the wooden oxen and rolling horses ? They have a written 
character and a literature and they are well versed in astronomy 
or the science of the heavens, in that of numbers, and in astrology.

Wu-t e u (Ota) 

From Karnasuvarna he travelled south-west above 700 li and 
came to the Wu (17) — t‘u country. 1 This, he states, was above 
7000 li in circuit, and its capital above twenty li In circuit, 
the soil was rich and fertile yielding fruits larger than 
those of other lands, and its rare plants and noted flowers could 
not be enumerated ; the climate was hot ; the people were of vio- 
lent ways, tall and of dark complexion, in speech and manners 
different from the people of “ Mid India ; ” they were indefatiga- 
ble students and many of them were Buddhists. There were above 
100 Buddhist monasteries, and a myriad Brethren all Mahayanists. 
Of Deva Temples there were 50, and the various sects lived pell- 
mell. There were more than ten Asoka topes at places where the 
Buddha had preached. In the south-west of the country was the 
Pu-sie-p c o-kH-li (restored by Julien as “ Pushpagiri ’ J ) monastery 
in a mountain; the stone tope of this monastery exhibited super- 
natural lights and other mircales, sun-shades placed by worship- 
pers on it between the dome and the amalaka remained there like 
needles held by a magnet. To the north-east of this tope in a hill 
monastery was another tope like the preceding in its marvels. The 
miraculous power of these topes was due to the topes having been 
erected by supernatural beings. 2 Near the shore of the ocean in the 
south-east of this country was the city Che-li-ta-lo (Charitra ?) , 3 
above twenty li in circuit, which was a thoroughfare and resting- 
place for sea-going traders and strangers from distant lands. The 
city was naturally strong and it contained many rare commodities. 
Outside it were five monasteries close together, of lofty structure and 
with very artistic images. Far away, 20,000 li distant in the south 
was the Seng-ka-lo (Ceylon) Country, and from this place on calm 
nights one could see the brilliant light from the pearl on the top 
of the tope over the Buddha’s Tooth-relic in that country.

Kung-yii ( Gu or Ya) To 

From the Ota country a journey south-west, through a forest, 
for over 1200 li brought the pilgrim to the Kung-yii (or gu or -ya)~ 
fo country . 4 This country was above 1000 li in circuit, and its 
capital was above twenty li in circuit. It was a hilly country 
bordering on a bay of the sea, with regular harvests, a hot climate. 
The people were tall and valorous and of a black complexion, 
having some sense of propriety and not very deceitful. Their 
written language was the same as that of India, but their ways of 
speaking were different, and they were not Buddhists. Deva Temples 
were above 100 in number, and of Tirthikas there were more 
than 10000. The country contained some tens of towns which 
stretched from the slopes of the hills to the edge of the sea. As the 
towns were naturally strong there was a gallant army which kept 
the neighbouring countries in awe, and so there was no powerful 
enemy. As the country was on the sea side it contained many 
rare precious commodities; the currency was couries and pearls; 
and the country produced large dark-coloured elephants which 
were capable of long journeys. 

Ka-leng-ka (Kalinga) 

From Kung-yu-t e o the pilgrim travelled through jungle and 
forest dense with huge trees, south-west for 1400 or 1500 U, to 
Kalinga. This country he describes as above 5000 li in circuit, 
its capital 5 being above twenty li. There were regular seed-time 
and harvest, fruit and flowers grew profusely, and there were 
continuous woods for some hundreds of li The country produced 
dark wild elephants prized by the neighbouring countries. The 
climate was hot. The people were rude and headstrong in dis- 
position, observant of good faith and fairness, fast and clear in 
speech ; in their talk and manners they differed somewhat from 
“ Mid-India.” There were few Buddhists, the majority of the 
people being of other religions. There were above ten Buddhist 
monasteries, and 500 Brethren, “ Students of the Mahayanist 
Sthavira school system/’ There were more than 100 Deva Tem- 
ples, and the professed adherents of the various sects were very

numerous, the majority being nirgranthas. 6 This country had 
once been very densely inhabited ; a holy rsi possessing superna- 
tural powers had his hermitage in it ; he was once offended by 
a native and cursed the country ; as a consequence of this curse 
the land became, and remained, utterly depopulated. In the lapse 
of many years since that event it had gradually become inhabited 
again, but it still had only a scanty population. Near the south 
wall of the city (i.e. the capital apparently) was an Asoka tope 
beside which were a sitting-place and exercise-ground of the Four 
Past Buddhas. On a ridge of a mountain in the north of the 
country was a stone tope, above 100 feet high, where a Pratyeka 
Buddha had passed away at the beginning of the present kalpa when 
men’s lives extended over countless years. 

The Southern Kosala 

From Kalinga he went north-west by hill and wood for above 
1800 li to Kosala. 7 This country, more than 6000 It in circuit, was 
surrounded by mountains and was a succession of woods and 
marshes, its capital being above 40 li in circuit. The soil of the 
country was rich and fertile, the towns and villages were close 
together ; the people were prosperous, tall of stature and black in 
colour ; the king was a ksatriya by birth, a Buddhist in religion, 
and of noted benevolence. There were above 100 Buddhist 
monasteries and about 10000 Brethren, all Mahayanists. Near the 
South of the city (that is apparently, the capital) was an old 
monastery with an Asoka tope where Buddha had vanquished 
Tirthikas by the exhibition of supernormal powers, and in which 
Nagarjuna P f usa had afterwards lodged. Contemporary with this 
P'usa was the king styled Sha-to-tfo-ha or “ Leading-right 99 (yin- 
cheng ), 8 who treated Nagarjuna with ceremonious respect, and 
kept a guard at his residence.

and requested to be admitted, the disciple in charge of the door 
reported the circumstance. Nagarjuna, who had heard of the 
vistor’s fame, merely filled his bowl with water 
and gave it to the disciple to show to Deva. This nagarjuna 
last silently dropped a needle into the bowl, and dis- and aryabeva 
missed the disciple. On learning this Nagarjima 
exclaimed — “ He is a wise man ! It is for the gods to know the 
hidden springs, and it is the sage who searches out their minute 
developments ; as the man has such excellence call him in at once.” 
“ What do you mean,” asked the disciple, — “is this a case of 
4 Silence being eloquence V Nagarjuna explained that the bowl 
full of water typified his own universal knowledge, and the drop- 
ping of the needle into it typified Deva’s thorough comprehension 
of all that knowledge. When Deva was admitted he was modest 
and timid, and he expressed his views clearly and distinctly, wish- 
ing to be instructed. Nagarjuna said to him — “ You as a scholar 
are above your contemporaries, and your excellent discourse sheds 
glory on your predecessors. I am old and feeble, and meeting one 
of such superior abilities as you I have a pitcher into which to 
draw water, and a successor to whom the continuous lamp may 
be handed over. You can be relied on for propagating the religion. 
Please come forward, and let us talk of the mysteries of Buddhism.” 
Deva was proceeding to enter on an exposition when a look at the 
majestic face of Nagarjuna made him forget his words and remain 
silent. Then he declared himself a disciple, and Nagarjuna having 
reassured him taught him the true Buddhism. Nagarjuna had the 
secret of long life, and had attained an age of several centuries, 
with his mental faculties still flourishing, when he voluntarily put 
an end to his life in the following circumstances. The king Yin - 
cheng was also some hundreds of years old, and his life depended 
on that of Nagarjuna by whom it had been prolonged. This king’s 
youngest son became impatient to succeed, and learning from his 
mother the secret of his father’s life, at her instigation he went 
to the great Pusa, and persuaded him that it was his duty to die 
on behalf of the young prince. Nagarjuna, accordingly, cut his 
own head off with a dry blade of grass, and his death was immedi- 
ately followed by that of the old king.

compact like a single rock. Here king Yin-cheng had quarried for 
Nagarjuna a monastery in the mountain, and had cut in the rock a 
path, communicating with the monastery, for above 
sri parvata ten li. The monastery had cloisters and lofty halls ; 

monastery these halls were In five tiers , each with four 

courts, with temples containing gold life-size 
images of the Buddha of perfect artistic beauty. It was well sup- 
plied with running water, arid the chambers were lighted by 
windows cut in the rock. In the formation of this establishment the 
king’s treasury soon became exhausted, and Nagarjuna then pro- 
vided an abundant supply by transmuting the rocks into gold. 11 
In the topmost hall Nagarjuna deposited the scriptures of S&akya- 
muni Buddha and the writings of the P c usas. In the lowest hall 
were the laymen attached to the monastery and the stores, and the 
three intermediate halls were the lodgings of the Brethren. When 
the king had finished the construction of this monastery an estimate 
of the maintenance of the workmen came to nine koti of gold coins. 
In later times the Brethren had disagreed, and had referred their 
quarrels to the king ; then the retainers of the monastery, fearing 
that the establishment would become a prey to the lawless, ex- 
cluded the Brethren, and made new barriers to keep them out ; 
since then there have not been any Brethren in the monastery, and 
the way of access to it was not known. 

An-to-lo ( Andhra) 

From Kosala he travelled South, through a forest, for above 
900 li to the An-to-lo country. This country was above 3000 li in 
circuit, and its capital P £ ing-ch*i (or k c i) -lo 12 was above twenty li 
in circuit. The country had a rich fertile soil with a moist hot 
climate ; the people were of a violent character ; their mode of 
speech differed from that of “ Mid-India ” but they followed the 
same system of writing. There were twenty odd Buddhist monas- 
teries with more than 3000 Brethren. Near the capital was a large 
monastery with a succession of high halls and storeyed terraces 
wrought with perfect art, and containing an exquisite Image of the 

heard wrong, but not Parvafci. But there seems to be no doubt that both 
Fa-hien and Yuan Chwang describe one and the same Buddhist monastery, 
that this must have been the Sri Parvata monastery famous in Nagarjuna 
legends as the place where he spent his last days, and now found mentioned 
in the Nagarjunikonda inscription F.— Beal, ii p. 214 n. 80; Watters ii, 207-8;

Buddha. In front of the monastery was a stone tope some hundreds 
of feet high, tope and monastery being the work of the arhat A-clie- 
lo (Acara, translated by So-hsing, “ Performance ” or “Rule of 
Conduct ”) . Near the south-west of this monastery was an Asoka 
tope where the Buddha preached, displayed miracles, and received 
into his religion a countless multitude. Above twenty li further 
south-west was an isolated hill on the ridge of which was a stone 
tope where Ch c en~na lz Pusa composed a “ yinming- 
lun ” or treatise on Logic (or the Science dinnaga 
of Inference). Ch'en-na after the Buddha had 
departed from this life came under his influence, and 
entered the Order. The aspirations of his spiritual knowledge 
were vast and his intellectual strength was deep and sure. Pitying 
the helpless state of his age he thought to give expansion to Bud- 
dhism. As the sastra on the science of Inference was deep and 
terse, and students wrought at it in vain, unable to acquire a know- 
ledge of its teachings, he went apart to live in calm seclusion to 
examine the qualities of the writings on it, and investigate their 
characteristics of style and meaning. Hereupon a mountain-god 
took the Fusa up in the air, and proclaimed that the sense of the 
Yin-ming-lun, originally uttered by the Buddha had been lost, and 
that it would that day be set forth at large again by Ch c en-na . This 
latter then sent abroad a great light which illuminated the dark- 
ness. The sight of this light led to the king’s request that Ch'en-na 
should proceed at once to the attainment of arhatship. When the 
Pusa reluctantly agreed to do so, Manjusri appeared, and recalled 
him to his high designs and aspirations for the salvation of others, 
and also summoned him to develop for the benefit of posterity the 
“ Yu-ka-shih-ti-lun 99 (Yogacarya-bhumi-sastra) , originally deli- 
vered by Maitreya. On this Ch £ en-na renounced the idea of an 
arhat’s career, and devoted himself to a thorough study and develop- 
ment of the treatise on the science of Inference. When he had 
finished his work on this subject, he proceeded to the propagation 
of the rich teaching of the Yoga system, and had disciples who 
were men of note among their contemporaries. 

T ( e~Na~Che~ka (Dhcinakataka ?) 14 

From Andhra the pilgrim continued his journey south, through 
wood and jungle, for over 1000 li and reached the Te-na-ka-che- 
ka country. This was above 6000 li in circuit, and its capital was

above 40 li in circuit. 15 The country had a rich soil and yielded 
abundant crops ; there was much waste land and the inhabited 
towns were few; the climate was warm, and the people were of black 
complexion, of violent disposition, and fond of the arts. There was 
a crowd of Buddhist monasteries but most of them were deserted, 
about twenty being in use, with 1000 Brethern mostly adherents of 
the Mahasahghika system. There were above 100 Deva-Temples 
and the followers of the various sects were very numerous. 

At a hill to the east of the capital was a monastery called 
Fu~p‘osliih4o (Purvasild) or “East Mountain,” and at a hill to 
the west of the city was the A~fa-loshih~lo 
monasteries (Avarasila) or “West Mountain” monastery. 

These had been erected for the Buddha by a 
former King of the country, who had made a communicating path by 
the river, and quarrying the rocks had formed high halls with long 
broad corridors continuous with the steep sides of the hills. The 
local deities guarded the monasteries, which had been frequented 
by saints and sages. During the millennium immediately following 
the Buddha’s decease a thousand ordinary Brethren came here 
every year to spend the Retreat of the rainy season. On the day 
of leaving Retreat these all became arhats, and by their super- 
normal powers went away through the air. Afterwards common 
monks and arhats sojourned here together, but for more than 100 
years there had not been any Brethren resident in the establish- 
ment, and visitors were deterred by the forms of wild animals 
which the mountain-gods assumed. 

Not far from the south side of the capital was a mountain-cliff 
in the Asura’s Palace in which the Sastra-Master P‘o-p‘i-fei-ka 16 
waits to see Maitreya when he comes to be Buddha. Then we have 
the story of this renowned dialectician, who “ externally displaying 
the Sankhya garb, internally propagated the learning of Nagarjuna.” 
Hearing that Hu-fa (Dharmapala) Pusa was preaching Buddhism 
* in Magadha with some thousands of disciples, the Sastra-Master 
longing for a discussion, set off, staff in hand, to see him. On 
arriving at Pataliputra he learned that Hu-fa was at the Bodhi- 
Tree and thither he sent as messenger a disciple with the 
following message for the P‘usa : “I have long yearned 

to come under the influence of you as a preacher of Buddhism, 
and a guide to the erring, but have failed to pay my respects to you

through the non-fulfilment of a former prayer. 1 have vowed not 
to see the Bodhi-Tree in vain. If I visit it I must become Buddha 
Fa-hu sent back a reply that human life was illusory and fleeting, 
and that he was too much occupied to Have a discussion. 
Messengers and messages went to and fro, but there was no 
interview. Then the Sastra-Master went back to his home in this 
country, and after calm reflection concluded that his doubts could 
be solved only by an interview with Maitreya as .Buddha. He 
thereupon abstained from food, only drinking water, and for three 
years repeated before an image of Kuan-tzu-tsai P*usa the 
“ Sui-hsin Dharani.” After all this that PTxsa appeared in his 
beautiful form, and on hearing the devotee’s desire to remain in 
this world to see Maitreya, he advised him rather to cultivate a 
higher goodness which would lead to rebirth in the Tusita Heaven 
and so accelerate an interview with Maitreya. But the Sastra-Master 
had made up his mind, and was not to be moved from his resolve. 
So Kuan-tzu-tsai P‘usa directed him to go to this country, to the 
shrine of the god Vajrapani, in the cliff to the south of the capital, 
and on reciting the “Vajrapani Dharani” there he would obtain his 
desire. The Sastra-Master acted on the advice, and after three years’ 
repetition of the dharani, the god appeared, gave a secret 
prescription, and told the devotee to make due petition at the 
Asura’s Palace in the cliff; the rock would then open and he was 
to enter, on the coming of Maitreya the god would let him know. 
After three more years’ constancy, the Sastra-Master with a charmed 
mustard-seed struck the cliff which thereupon opened. There 
were at the place many myriads of people who had continued 
gazing, forgetful of their homes. When the Sastra-Master passed 
quietly in, he urged the crowd to follow, but only six ventured 
after him ; the others held back through fear, but they lamented 
their mistake.

From Dhanakataka the pilgrim went south-west above 1000 li to 
Chu-li-ya, 17 This country was about 2,400 li in circuit, and its capi- 
tal was above ten li in circuit. It was a wild jungle region with 
very few settled inhabitants, and bands of highwaymen went about 
openly ; it had a moist hot climate ; the people were of a fierce 
and profligate character and were believers in the Tirthikas ; the 
Buddhist monasteries were in ruins, and only some of them had

Brethren ; there were several tens of Deva Temples, and the 
Digambaras were numerous. To the south-east of the capital, and 
near it, was an Asoka tope where the Buddha had preached, 
wrought miracles, overcome Tirthikas, and received men and devas 
into his communion. Near the west side of the city was an old 
monastery where Deva P'usa had discussed with the arhat Uttara. 
And this is the story of the discussion. 18 Deva had heard of this 
arhat with supernormal powers and attainments, so he made a 
long journey to see him and observe his style of teaching. Uttara, 
being a man content with little, had only one couch in his room, 
so he made a heap of fallen leaves on which he bade his guest 
recline. When the arhat was ready Deva stated his difficulties, 
and the arhat gave his solutions, then Deva replied and put further 
questions and so on for seven rounds ; the arhat unable to reply 
transported himself secretly to the Tusita Paradise and obtained 
the necessary explanations from Maitreya who told him that he 
should be very respectful to Deva who was to be a Buddha in the 
present kalpa ; when Uttara imparted his information to Deva the 
latter recognised it as the teaching of Maitreya ; hereupon Uttara 
gave up his mat to Deva with polite apologies, and treated him 
with profound respect.

From Chulya he travelled 1,500 or 1,600 li through wood and 
jungle south to the Ta4o-p‘i-t‘u country. This was above 6,000

circuit. 19 The region had a rich fertile soil, it abounded in fruits 
and flowers and yielded precious substances. The people were 
courageous, thoroughly trustworthy, and public-spirited, and they 
esteemed great learning ; in their written and spoken language 
they differed from “ Mid-India.” There were more than 100 Bud- 
dhist monasteries with above 10,000 Brethren all of the Sthavira 
school. The Deva-Temples were above 80 , and the majority be- 
longed to the Digambaras. This country had been frequently 
visited by the Buddha, and king Asoka had erected topes 
at the various spots where the Buddha had preached and

of Dharmapala P‘usa 20 who was the eldest son of a high official 
of the city. He was a boy of good natural parts 
which received great development as he grew dharmapala 
up When he came of age a daughter of _ 

the king was assigned to him as wife but on the night 
before the ceremony of marriage was to be performed, being 
greatly distressed in mind, he prayed earnestly before an una 0 e 
Buddha. In answer to his prayer a god bore him away to am - 
tain monastery some hundreds of li from the capital When the 
Brethren of the monastery heard his story they complied with his 
request, and gave him ordination, and the king on ascertaining 
what had become of him treated him with increased reverence and 
distinction. Not far from the south of the capital was a larg_ 
monastery which was a rendezvous for the most eminent men o 
the country. It had an Asoka tope above 100 feet high where th- 
Buddha had once defeated Tirthikas by preaching, 
many into his communion. Near it were traces of a sittm 0 -p a

In the south of the country near the sea was the Mo-lo-ya 
(Malaya) mountain, with lofty cliffs and ridges and deep valleys 
and gullies, on which were sandal, camphor and other trees. 22 To 
the east of this was the Pu-ta-lo-ka (Potalaka) mountain with steep 
narrow paths over its cliffs and gorges in irregular confusion ; on 
the top was a lake of clear water, whence issued a river 
which, on its .way to the sea, flowed tw'enty times round 
the mountain. By the side of the lake was a stone Deva- 
palace frequented by Kuan-tzu-tsai Phisa. Devotees risking life,

distinguished by going in the height of summer to the top of some hill, 
and then looking at a distance great serpents may be seen entwining it; thus 
it is known. Its wood is naturally cold, and therefore serpents twine round 
it. After having noted the tree, they shoot an arrow into it to mark it. 
In the winter, after the snakes have gone, the tree is cut down. The tree 
from which Kie-pu-lo (karpura) scent is procured, is in trunk like the pine, 
but different leaves and flowers and fruit. When the tree is first cut down 
and sappy, it has no smell; but when the wood gets dry, it forms into veins 
and splits; then in the middle is the scent, in appearance like mica, of the 
colour of frozen-snow. This is what is called (in Chinese) long-nao-hiang, 
the dragon-brain scent.”

was above 5000 li and its capital above thirty li in circuit. 24 It 
had more than 100 Buddhist monasteries and above 10000 Brethren 
who were students of both “ Vehicles.” Close to the capital was a 
large monastery with above 300 Brethren all men of great distinc- 
tion. In the temple of this monastery was a tiara of Prince 
Sarvarthasiddha (that is, the prince who afterwards became 
Gautama Buddha) which was nearly two feet high adorned with 
gems and enclosed in a case ; on festival days it was exhibited and 
worshipped, and it could emit a bright light. In the temple of 
another monastery near the capital was a sandalwood image of 
Maitreya made by the arhat Sronavimsatikoti. To the north of the 
capital was a wood of tala trees above thirty li in circuit, 25 and 
within the wood was a tope where the Four Past Buddhas had sat 
and walked for exercise, and near this was the tope over the relics 
of Sronavimsatikoti. Near the capital on the east side was a tope 
which had associations with the Buddha’s preaching ; to the south- 
west of the capital were an Asoka tope at the spot where 
Sronavimsatikoti made miraculous exhibitions and had many con- 
verts, and besides the tope the remains of a monastery built by

tie went into conflict intoxicated, and their war-elephants were 
also made drunk before an engagement. Relying on the strength 
of his heroes and elephants the king treated 
pulakesin ii neighbouring countries with contempt. He was 

a ksatriya by birth, and his name was Pu-lo-

great king Siladitya at this time was invading east and west, and 
countries far and near were giving in allegiance to him, but Mo-ha- 
la-ch £ a refused to become subject to him. 

The people were fond of learning, and they combined ortho- 
doxy and heterodoxy. Of Buddhist monasteries there were above 
100 and the Brethren who were adherents of both Vehicles, were 
more than 5000 in number. Within and outside the capital were 
five Asoka topes where the Four Past Buddhas had sat and walked 
for exercise and there were innumerable other topes of stone or 
brick. Not far from the south of the capital was an old monastery 
in which was a stone image of Kuan-tzu-tsai P £ usa of marvellous 
efficacy. 

In the east of this country was a mountain range, ridges one 
above another in succession, tiers of peaks and sheer summits. 
Here was a monastery the base of which was in a dark defile, and 
its lofty halls and deep chambers were quarried in the cliff and 
rested on the peak, its tiers of halls and storeyed terraces had the 
cliff on their back and faced the ravine. This monastery had been 
built by the A-che-lo (Acara) of West India. 28 The pilgrim then 
relates the circumstances in Acara’s life which led to the building 
of the monastery. 29 Within the establishment, he adds, was a large

a tier of seven canopies unattached and unsupported, each canopy 
separated from the one above it by the space of three feet. The

Buddha’s career as Bodhisattva, including the circumstances of his 
attaining bodhi and the omens attending his final passing away, all 
great and small were here delineated. Outside the gate of the 
monastery, on either side north and south, was a stone elephant,

I shall briefly describe the ceremony of inviting priests, in

host comes previously to the priests, and after a salutation, invites 
them to the festival. On the Upavasatha-day he informs them 
saying, 4 It is the time!

The preparation of the utensils and seats for the priests is made 
according to circumstances. Necessaries may be carried (from the 
monastery) by some of the monastic servants ; or provided by the 
host. Only copper utensils as a rule are used, which are cleansed 
by being rubbed with fine ashes. Each priest sits on a small chair 
placed at such a distance that one person may not touch another. 
The shape of the chair has already been described in chapter iii . 4 
It is not wrong, however, to use earthenware 
utensils once, if they have not been used be- vessels 
fore. When they have been already used, 
they should be thrown away into a ditch, for used vessels 
(lit ‘touched’) should not be preserved at all Consequently in 
India, at almsgiving places at the side of the road, there are heaps 
of discarded utensils which are never used again. Earthenware 
(of superior quality) such as is manufactured at Siang-yang (in 
China) may be kept after having been employed, and after having 
been thrown away may be cleansed properly. In India there were 
not originally porcelain and lacquer works. Porcelain, if enamel- 
led, is, no doubt, clean. Lacquered articles are sometimes brought 
to India by traders ; people of the islands of the Southern Sea do 
not use them as eating utensils, because food placed in them re- 
ceives an oily smell. But they occasionally make use of them 
when new, after washing the oily smell away with pure ashes. 
Wooden articles are scarcely ever employed as eating utensils, yet, 
if new, they may be used once, but never twice, this being prohi- 
bited in the Vinaya. 

The ground of the dining hall at the host’s house is strewn 
over with cow-dung, and small chairs are placed at regular inter- 
vals; and a large quantity of water is prepared in 
a clean jar. When the priests arrive they untie washing 
the fastenings of their cloaks. All have clean 
jars placed before them : they examine the water, and 

if there are no insects in it, they wash their feet with it, then they 
sit down on the small chairs. When they have rested awhile, the 
host, having observed the time and finding that the sun is' nearly 
at the zenith, makes this announcement : 4 It is the time.’ Then 
each priest, folding his cloak by its two corners, ties them in front, 
and taking up the right comer of his skirt, holds it by the girdle 

4. In Oh. iii. (p. 22) we read: “In India the priests wash their hands 
and feet before meals, and sit on separate small chairs. The chair is about 
seven inches high by a foot square, and the seat of it is wicker-work made 
of rattan cane. The legs are rounded, and, on the whole, the chair is not 
heavy.”

at his left side. The priests cleanse their hands with powder made 
of peas or earth-dust ; and either the host pours water, or the priests 
themselves use water out of the Kundi (i.e. jars) ; this is done 
according as they find one way or the other more convenient. Then 
they return to their seats. Next eating-utensils are distributed to 
the guests, which they wash slightly so that water does not flow 
over them. It is never customary to say a prayer before meals. 
The host, having cleansed his hands and feet (by this time) , makes 
an offering to saints (images of arhats) at the upper end of the row 
of seats ; then he distributes food to the priests. At the lowest end 
of the row an offering of food is made to the mother, Hariti. 

H? $ $ 

The following is the manner of serving food. First, one or 
two pieces of ginger about the size of the thumb are served (to 
every guest) , as well as a spoonful or half of salt on a leaf. He 
who serves the salt, stretching forth his folded hands and kneeling 
before the head priest, mutters 4 Sampragatam ’ (well come!). 
This is translated by c good arrival.’ * * * Now the head priest 
says 4 Serve food equally.’ 

* * * 

He who serves food, standing before the guests, whose feet are 
in a line, bows respectfully, while holding plates, cakes, and fruits 
in his hands, serves them about one span away from (or above) 
the priest’s hands ; every other utensil or food must be offered 
one or two inches above the guest’s hands. If anything is served 
otherwise, the guests should not receive it. The guests begin to 
eat as soon as the food is served ; they should not trouble them- 
selves to wait till the food has been served all round. 

That they should wait till the food has been served equally all 
round is not a correct interpretation. Nor is it according to the 
Buddha’s instruction that one should do as one likes after a meal 

Next some gruel made of dried rice and bean soup is 
served with hot butter sauce as flavouring, which is to be mixed 
with the other food with the fingers. They (the guests) eat with 
the right hand, which they do not raise up higher than the middle 
part of the belly. Now cakes and fruits are served ; 
ghee and also some sugar. If any guest feels thirsty, he drinks 
cold water, whether in winter or summer. The above is a brief 
account of the eating of the priests in daily life as well as at a 
reception.

(B) ii. On chop sticks in China and India 

As to the mode of eating in the West, they use only the right 
hand, but if one has had an illness or has some other reason, one is 
permitted to keep a spoon for use . We never hear of chop-sticks 
in the five parts of India ; they are not mentioned in the Vinaya of 
the Four Schools (Nikayas) , and it is only China that has them. 
Laymen naturally follow the old custom (of using sticks), and 
priests may or may not use them according to their inclination. 
Chop-sticks were never allowed nor were they prohibited, thus 
the matter should be treated according to the £ abridged teaching/ 
for when the sticks are used, people do not discuss or murmur. 

In China they may be used, for if we obstinately reject their 
use, people may laugh or complain. 

They must not be used in India. Such is the idea of the 
‘ abridged teaching 5 (Samksiptavinaya) . 

—Op. cit, p. 90. 

(C) On clothing in different lands 

If we come to India in Chinese garments, they all laugh at us ; 
we get much ashamed in our hearts, and we tear our garments to 
be used for miscellaneous purposes, for they are all unlawful. If 
I do not explain this point, no one will know the fact. Although I 
wish to speak straightforwardly, yet I fear to see my hearer indig- 
nant. Hence I refrain from expressing my humble thought, yet I 
move about reflecting upon these points. 

I wish that the wise may pay serious attention and notice the 
proper rules of clothing. Further, laymen of India, the officers 
and people of a higher class have a pair of white soft cloth for their 
garments, while the poor and lower classes of people have only one 
piece of linen. It is only the homeless member of the Sahgha who 
possesses the three garments and six Requisites, and a priest who 
wishes for more (lit. who indulges in luxury) may use the thirteen 
Necessaries. 5 In China priests are not allowed to have a garment 


5. I-tsing says elsewhere: 

“There are strict rules about the six Requisites and the thirteen Neces- 
saries fully explained in the Vinaya. The following are the six Requisites 
of a Bhik§u: — ' 

• 1. The Sahghati, which is translated by the ‘double cloak/ 

2. The TJttarasanga, which is translated by the ‘upper garment/ 

3. The Antarvasa, which is translated by the ‘inner garment/ 

The above three are all called clvara. In the countries of the North

possessed of two sleeves or having one back, but the fact is that 
they themselves follow the Chinese customs, and falsely call them 
Indian. Now I shall roughly describe the people and their dresses 
in Jambudvipa and all the remote islands. From the Mahabodhi 
eastward to Lin-i (i.e. Champa) there are twenty countries ex- 
tending as far as the southern limits of Kwam Chou (in Annam) . 
If we proceed to the south-west we come to the sea ; and in the 
north Kasmxra is its limit. There are more than ten countries 
(islands) in the Southern Sea, added to these the Simhala island 
(Ceylon). In all these countries people wear two cloths (Skt< 
kambala). These are of wide linen eight feet long, which has no 
girdle and is not cut or sewn, but is simply put around the waist 
to cover the lower part. 

Besides India there are countries of the Parasas (Persians) 
and the Tajiks (generally taken as Arabs), who wear shirt and 
trousers. In the country of the naked people (Nicobar Isles) they 
have no dress at all ; men and women alike are all naked. From 
Kasmira to all the Mongolic countries such as Suli, Tibet, and the 
country of the Turkish tribes, the customs resemble one another 
to a great extent ; the people in these countries do not wear the 
covering-cloth (Skt. Kambala), but use wool or skin as much as 


these priestly cloaks are generally called ka§aya from their reddish colour. 
This is not, however, a technical term used in the Vinaya. 

4. Patra, the bowl. 

5. Nisidana, something for sitting or lying on. 

6. Parisravana, a water-strainer . 

A candidate for Ordination should be furnished with a set of the six 
Requisites. 

The following are the thirteen Necessaries : 

1. Sanghati, a double cloak. 

2. Uttarasanga, an upper garment. 

3. Antarvasa, an inner garment. 

4. Nisidana, a mat for sitting or lying on. 

5. Nivasana, an under garment. 

6. Prati-nivasana (a second nivasana). 

7. Sankaksika, a side-covering cloth. 

8. Prati-sankaksika (a second sankaksika) . 

9. Kaya-pronehana, a towel for wiping the body. 

10. Mukha-pronchana, a towel for wiping the face. 

11. Kesapratigraha, a piece of cloth used for receiving hair when one 
shaves. 

12. Kandupraticchadana, a piece of cloth for covering itches. 

13. (Bhesajapari^karacivara) , a cloth for defraying the cost of medicine

they can, and there is very little karpasa (i.e. cotton), which we 
see sometimes worn. As these countries are cold, the people al- 
ways wear shirt and trousers. Among these countries the Parasas, 
the Naked People, the Tibetans, 6 and the Turkish tribes have no 
Buddhist law, but the other countries had and have followed Bud- 
dhism ; and in the districts where shirts and trousers are used the 
people are careless about personal cleanliness. Therefore the 
people of the five parts of India are proud of their purity and 
excellence. 

. — Takakusu: I-Tsing, pp. 67-8. 

(D) Brahmans 

The Brahmans are regarded throughout the five parts of India 
as the most honourable (caste) . They do not, when they meet 
in a place, associate with the other three castes, and the mixed 
classes of the people have still less intercourse with them. The 
scriptures they revere are the four Vedas, containing about 100,000 
verses ; 4 Veda ’ hitherto was wrongly transcribed by the Chinese 
characters 4 Wei-t‘o the meaning of the word is 4 clear under- 
standing’ or 4 knowledge.’ The Vedas have been handed down 
from mouth to mouth, not transcribed on paper or leaves. In 
every generation there exist some intelligent Brahmans who can 
recite the 100,000 verses. In India there are two traditional ways 
by which one can attain to great intellectual power. Firstly, by 
repeatedly committing to memory the intellect is developed ; 
secondly, the alphabet fixes one’s ideas. By this way, after a prac- 
tice of ten days or a month, a student feels his thoughts rise like 
a fountain, and can commit to memory whatever he has once heard 
(not requiring to be told twice). This is far from being a myth, 
for I myself have met such men.

In A.D. 632 the first Buddhist King of Tibet sent an envoy to India to get 
the Buddhist Scriptures. I-tsing’s date is A.D. 671-695, and he says that 
the country had no Buddhism. We know, however, that some of the Parasas 
(Persian settlers) had become Buddhists in Hiuen Thsang’s time (see Hiuen 
Thsang under Persia) , and Tibet too was Buddhistic in his time.— Takakusu.

from the sovereign. Then he got into the tower secretly and stole 
the tooth of the Fo (Buddha), which he hoped to take to Ms coun- 
try in order that one may make many offerings to it. When he 
attempted to do so, by a just turn of events he was forced to give 
it up. The affair was not to his liking and he covered himself 
with disgrace and shame. 

He then went to South India. I heard that following the ad- 
vice of a man in Ceylon, he went (for rest) to the central place 
where the monastery of the Great Knowledge (Mahabodhi) is 
situated ; but there is no news of him and he must have died on 
the way ; we do not know how old he was. 

The people of the island of Ceylon guard this tooth of Fo 
(Buddha) with extraordinary care. They have placed it in a high 
tower ; they lock its many doors with complicated safety locks ; 
on the locks they set a seal on which five officials affix their marks. 
If a door is opened, a resounding noise fills the town and its suburbs. 
Every day they go and make offerings to this relic, and cover it 
with fragrant flowers on all sides. If one supplicates with great 
faith, then the tooth appears above the flowers or a supernatural 
light is produced, and the whole crowd can see it. 

According to one tradition, if this island loses the tooth of 
Buddha, it will fall a prey to the Raksasas ; to prevent this calamity, 
the tooth is guarded with exceptional care. 

According to another tradition, this tooth must go to the 
country of China. That will be the distant effect of holy power ; 
if we have faith, it will come. How could this be realised by the aid 
of a man who pretended to accomplish by violence what was not 
his task?

Such are the reports that have reached me ; but now I do not

XVI. 692-720 A.D. EMBASSIES FROM SOUTH INDIA 
TO CHINA 

In the third month of the third year t’ien-cheou (692), the 
king of the kingdom of Eastern India Mo-lo~pa»mo, the 

king of the kingdom of Western India Che-lo-ito (Sila- 

ditya), the king of the kingdom of the South India 
Tche-leou~k £ i-pa-lo (Calukya Vallabha) , the king of the kingdom 
of Northern India Na-na, the king of the kingdom of central India 
Ti-mo-si-na and the king of the kingdom Kiecu-tse (Koutcha) 
Yen-yao-pa all came to render homage and make presents, (pp. 24- 
25), 

(The kingdom of South India, among others sent an embassy 
with tribute and the products of the country) . In the reign of the 
Emperor Joei-tsong, in the 9th month of the first year (710) the 
kingdom of South India and the T £ ou-po, (Tibetans) , and in the 10th 
month the kingdoms of Sie~yu (Zabulistan) and of Ki-pin (Kapisa) 
all sent ambassadors bringing in tribute and products of their coun- 
tries. The Kagan “who respects the transformation” the Tou-k’i- 
che (Turgach) Cheou-tchong, ordered an ambassador to go and 
render homage (p. 28). 

I. In the eighth year of K c ai-yuen (720), the king of the 
kingdom of South India, Che-li Na-lo-seng-kia (Sri Narasimha), 
proposed to employ his war elephants and his cavalry to chastise 
the Ta-che (Arabs) as well as the T £ ou~po (Tibetans) 1 and others. 
Moreover he asked that a name be given to his army ; the emperor 
praised it greatly and named his army ; “ the army which cherished 
virtue,” 

II. In the 8th year K £ ai~yuen (720) , the 8th month, the day ting- 
tch*eou, a decree was addressed to tchong-chow-men-hia to inform 
him that the king of South India having sent from afar (an ambas- 
sador) to render homage and pay tribute, and this ambassador being 
due to return, he must look after him with the greatest care till his 
departure and act in such a way that his desires might be fulfilled. 
This ambassador was therefore given a robe of flowered silk, a 
golden girdle, a purse with an emblem in the form of a fish and the 
seven objects ; then he was sent away. 

1° this period “the supremacy of Tibet was so firmly established in 
Bengal that, for 200 years, the Bay of Bengal was known as the sea of 
Tibet. ’ BG. Li. p. 501, See Abuifeda ed. Reinaud ecclviii, Encycl. Br. Tibet. 
Ibn Hawkal and A1 Ishtakri called the Bay by that name.

ILL In the 11th month, an ambassador was sent to confer by 
brevet the title of king of the kingdom of South India on the 
king of the kingdom of South India, Che-li-Na-lo-seng-k’ia pao-to- 
pa-mo (Sri Narasimha Potavarman). 

The texts marked I and II under year 720 are found again in 
Kieou Tang Chou which adds the following: “ the 9th month, the 
King of South India Che-li-Na-lo-seng-k £ ia~to~pa (Sri Narasimha 
Potavarman) constructed a temple on account of the empire (Le. of 
China); he addressed to the emperor a request asking from him 
an inscription giving a name to this temple; by decree, It was decided 
that the name should be ‘ which causes return to virtue’ (Koei- 
hoa) and it was presented to him (i.e. the emperor sent Narasimha a 
tablet with the inscription Koei-hoa se, so that it might be placed 
on the front of the temple erected in India by Narasimha for the 
benefit of China) This Narasimha, king of Kahci, is known to us 
from the Mahavamsa and from the inscriptions of India; and relying 
on these last pieces of evidence, inscriptions, Sylvain-Levi has 
proposed to carry back the reign of this prince to about 700 A.D. 
(J.A .1900 May- June); we see that his conclusion is borne out by 
the Chinese texts which speak at such length of t§ri Narasimha 
Potavarman in 720. (Chavannes, p. 44 n) 

The data given in these extracts from Ts‘o fou yuan Kouel , a 
great Chinese cyclopaedia compiled about 1013 A. D., are confirmed 
by the following extract from Ma Twan-lin : 

“In the third of the years keen-fung (A. D. 667), the Five 
Indias (or five kingdoms of India) sent ambassadors to the court 
of the emperor. In the years kae-yuen (A.D. 713 to 742) , an ambas- 
sador from Central India proceeded three times as far as the ex- 
tremity of southern India, and came only once to offer birds of five 
colours that could talk. He applied for aid against the Ta-she 
(or Arabs) and the Too-fan (or Tibetans), offering to take the 
command of the auxiliary troops. The Emperor Heuen-tsung (who 
reigned from A. D. 713 to 756) conferred upon him the rank of 
general-in-chief. The Indian ambassadors said to him: *the Fan 
(or Tibetan) barbarians are captivated only by clothes and 
equipments. Emperor! I must have a long, silk embroidered robe, 
a leathern belt decorated with gold, and a bag in the shape of a 
fish.’ All these articles were ordered by the emperor.”

AND MERCHANTS IN CANTON 


The Chinese priest Kien-tchen, (742-54), Kanshin in Japanese, 
made a voyage from China to Japan, and this was described by his 
contemporary and disciple Aomi-no Mabito Genkai. In this descrip- 
tion we read : “ There were also three monasteries of Po-lo-men 

(Brahmans) where Brahmans were residing. The tanks in these 
monasteries contained blue lotuses, particularly beautiful, of which 
the flowers, leaves and roots were perfumed. 

“ On the river (of Kouang-tong) (Canton) there were mer- 
chantmen belonging to the Po-lo-men (Brahmans of India), the 
Po-sseu (Persians) , the K‘ouen-louen (Malays) , and others besides, 
of which it is difficult to determine the number. They were all 
laden with incense, herbs, jewels and other precious products. 
The merchandise was piled up in heaps. These ships were 60 to 
70 feet deep . 

“ The barbarians, white, red and so on, coming from the Land 
of the Lion (Simhala, Ceylon), the Land of the Ta-che (Tadjik, 
Arabia) , or the Land of the Kou-t‘ang were in the habit of coming 
or stopping there. An enormous variety of races was encountered 
there.”

(A) Route to the East 

Narmechireh, 1 the boundary between Persia and Sind, is 7 days* 
journey by water (from Ormuz) ; — From there to Daibal, 8 
days. This town is two parasangs from the Mouth of the 
Mehran (Indus). The country of Sind produces the costus (cos- 
tus speciosus), cane and bamboo. From the river Mehran to 
(Yeksir?) 2 where Indian territory begins, 4 days. They 
gather cane in the mountains and corn 3 in the plains; the 
people, divided into tribes, live by brigandage. Two farsakhs 
beyond, there lives another people the Meycl, 4 who also apply them- 
selves to stealing. From there to Koul (or Koula), 2 parasangs. 
From Kaoul to Sendan, where you have the teakwood (sadj) and 
cane, 18 parasangs. From Sendan to Mely (Malabar), land of 
pepper and bamboo, 5 days. The sailors say that every bunch 
of pepper is covered up by a leaf which shelters it from the rain ; 
when the rain ceases, the leaves turn off ; if it starts raining again, 
they cover the fruit once more. From Mely to Balm, 5 2 journeys. 
From there to the great gulf (sea) 2 days. At Balia, the route 
divides itself (into two). Following the coast, we reach Baneh 
(or Bas), which produces rice which they carry to Serandib, 2 
days. Sandy and Askan, land producing rice, 2 days. Koura, 
where many rivers empty themselves, 3 parasangs. Kilakan 
(Kilkayan) , Louar and Kendjeh, 2 days. This country produces 
wheat and rice ; they send aloes by way of the fresh water, 6 from 
countries situated at a distance of 15 days, such as Kamoul and 
other places. From Semender to Ourtasir, 7 great kingdom where 
abound the elephant, the horse, the buffalo and all sorts of products, 
12 parasangs. From Ourtasir to Aineh, where again we find 
elephants, 4 days. From Houbalin (?) to Serendib, 2 days. 

Serendlb (Ceylon) is 80 parasangs in length and breadth. We 
find there the mountain on which Adam was thrown (after having 
been chased from the earthly paradise) . The summit is lost in

about twenty days (sic) . The Brahmans, who are the pious 
people of India, show on this mountain the impress of one of the 
feet of Adam ; the other is found in India, at a distance of two or 
three days from the first. They gather in this mountain aloes, 
pepper, and many kinds of aromatic stuff and perfumes. We find 
in the neighbourhood different varieties of rubies and other precious 
stones ; in fine, in the valley, a mine of diamonds and musk-goats 
(des chevres a muse) . The people of India say that the foot of 
Adam has left only one mark on the rock, and that a flame leaps 
up incessantly on the summit of the mountain like lightning. Seren- 
dib produces cocoanut and emery which serves to polish the metals; 
we find in its rivers rock-crystals and along its coasts are establish- 
ed the pearl-fisheries.

( B ) Principal Kings of India : Elephants 

The kings and the peoples of India abstain from wine ; but 
they consider adultery a lawful act with the exception of the king 
of Komar who abstains from both. On the contrary the king of 
Serendib gets the wines of Irak for his use. All the kings set 
great store on the elephant, and they compete for its acquisition 
at gold prices. The maximum height of this animal is 9 cubits. 
However, in Ghobb 8 one could find elephants which are 10 or 11 
cubits high. The most powerful sovereign of India is the Balhara 
whose name signifies ‘ King of Kings.’ On his ring is engraved 
this motto : “ Anything undertaken with passion always ends in 
success.” After him come the King of Tafen, the King of Djabah 
(Java) ; the King of Djozr (Gujerat?) where the dirhems called 
the tatherides are current ; the King of Anah, and Rahma. The 
states of the last named are far from all the others by a year’s 
journey. 9 Rahma possesses 50,000 elephants, cotton stuffs and 
aloes. After him comes the King of Kamroun, whose kingdom 
touches China and abounds in rhinoceroses. This animal has a horn 
in front, one cubit long and the thickness of two palms. We find 
a sort of figure marked in the direction of its length. When it is

slit, inside one could find standing out in white on a black back-

bird. The Chinese buy them to make waist bands of which the 
price varies from two hundred dinars up to three or four thousand.

his states an Island named Dhou-Tail , which resounds with the 
sounds of tambours and timbals. According to the report of 
sailors, in these parts one finds a horse which resembles the species 
of horse found among us, but whose mane is so long that it drags 
on the ground. The Maharaja collects each day a contribution of 
200.. pieces of Gold. He melts this sum into a single ingot and 
throws it into the water saying, “ Here is my treasury.” There is 
in this sea an Island in which there are monkeys that have tails 
like that of an ass. 

— J. A.: ibid. pp. 289-91. 

(C) Castes 

There are seven castes in India : 

1. The Sabekferya (B. the Sabiens, Ed. Sakrya). This is the 
caste of the nobility and of the king. All the other castes prostrate 
before them, but they do not render this homage to any one. 

2. The Brahmans, who drink neither wine nor any fermented 
liquor. 

3. The Kesrya (Ksatriya) . They drink 3 cups of wine only. 
They cannot marry into Brahman families, but the latter marry 
their daughters. 

4. The Soudarya (Sudra) or cultivators. 

5. Meisera (Vaisya) artisans and labourers. 

6. The Sandalya (Chandala) servants and escorts. 

7. The Zenya (musicians and jugglers) . 

There are 42 religious sects among the Hindus. Some believe 
in God (may His holy name be glorified) and in the mission of the 
prophets ; others reject the prophets, yet others reject all these 
beliefs alike. 

In this country is found a class of magicians who realize 
everything that they wish for, by their spells and heal all sickness. 
Versed in the occult sciences and in the art of divination, they 
exercise an absolute authority, do good and evil, conjure up appari- 
tions and' phantoms which strike the spirit with fear, and command 
rain and hail.

XIX. TWO ARAB WRITERS 


I. Anonymous (Suleiman ?) 

A. The Maldives , Ceylon and other islands 

The third sea is the sea of Harkand (Bay of Bengal) . Between 
this sea and that of Lay (Gujarat) lie numerous islands (the Lacca- 
dives and the Maldives). They say that their number goes -up to 
1900. These isles separate the two seas. They are governed by a 
woman. Occasionally, (the sea casts upon the shores) of these 
islands large pieces of amber ; these pieces often look like a plant 
or something similar. This amber grows like a plant, at the bottom 
of the sea. When the sea is very rough, it throws up the amber 
to the surface, and the pieces of amber look like mushrooms or 
truffle. 

In these islands, where a woman rules, cocoanut is cultivated. 
These islands are separated from one another by distances of two, 
three or four parasangs. 1 They are all inhabited, and they grow 
the cocoanut-trees in all of them. The wealth of the people is 
constituted by cowries ; their queen amasses large quantities of 
these cowries in the royal depots. They say that there is not in 
existence a people more industrious than these islanders, so much 
so that they weave tunics of a single piece with two sleeves, two 
facings of the collar and the opening of the chest. They build 
ships, houses and execute all sorts of works with a consummate 
art. 

The cowries are got by them from the surface of the sea. (The 
head of this mollusc) encloses something living. (To fish them up) , 
they take a branch of the cocoanut tree, and put it in the sea, and 
the cowries attach themselves to it. The islanders give the cowries 
the name of kahtaj. 

The last of these Isles is (Sirandib) Ceylon ; it is situated in 
the sea of Harkand. It is the most important island of this arch!-' 
pelago. 

All these islands (the Laccadives and the Maldives) are call- 
ed Dlbajat. At Sirandib is found a pearl fishery. The island is 
completely surrounded by the sea. In the island there is a moun- 
tain called Rahun on which was thrown Adam— Salutation to him 
— (when he was chased out of earthly paradise) . The print of his

feet is on the summit of the mountain hollowed in the stone. At 
the summit of the mountain there is only the mark of a single 
step. It is said that Adam in taking a stride put his other leg into 
the sea. It is also said that the footprint found at the summit of 
the mountain is about 70 cubits long. 

In a region around this mountain abundant precious stones 
are found : rubies, topaz, and sapphire. 

In the island of Ceylon there are two kings. It is big and 
extensive. Aloes, gold, precious stones are found on it and in the 
sea which bathes it, the pearl and shank are found. The latter is a 
big shell used as a trumpet into which one blows. It is preserved 
like a precious thing. 

— -Ferrand, Voyage 9 pp. 31-3. 

B. On India , China and their Kings 

The people of India and China are of unanimous opinion that 
the great kings of the world are four in number. The first among 
them in rank is the king of the Arabs, (that is to say the Khalif of 
Baghdad). Indians and Chinese are agreed without contradiction 
on the fact that the king of the Arabs is the greatest of the kings, 
the richest and the most magnificent, that is the king of the great 
religion of Islam, above whom there is no one. The king of China 
takes the second rank, after the king of the Arabs. Then follows 
the king of Bum (Byzance) and the Baiiahra, the king of those 
who have their ears bored (to suspend rings). The Baiiahra is 
the sovereign of India who belongs to the highest nobility, which 
the Indians themselves recognize. Each king of the Indians is 
independent, but all recognize the high nobility of the Baiiahra. 
When the Baiiahra sends ambassadors to other kings, the latter 
pray in the name of these ambassadors to do honour to him 
whom they represent. The Baiiahra makes generous gifts like 
the Arabs. He has horses and elephants, in great number, and 
plenty of money. His money is the dirham (piece of gold) , called 
tatiri. The weight of each of these dirham is equal to that of one 
dirham and half of the king’s money. 

The Baiiahra dates his era starting from the year of the reign 
of the sovereign who preceded him (sic), 2 whilst the Arabs date 
from the Hegira of the Prophet — Salutation to him; — as against the 
latter, the Indians date according to the kings, and their kings 
/reign long, sometimes a king reigns for 50 years. ■ The subjects of 

2. Here Reinaud has: “Their era starts from the year in which the 
dynasty came to the throne.” (p. 25)— which is more intelligible.

FOREIGN NOTICES 


BaUahra claim that if their kings reign and live long, it is due to 
the affection that they have for the Arabs. There is in fact no king 
who has greater affection for the Arabs than the Ballahra. It is 
the same with his subjects. 

Ballahra is the title of all the kings of this country like Kisra 
(for Persians, Caesar for Romans) . It is not a proper name. The 
territory of the Ballahra kingdom begins on the sea coast (west of 
India) where there is a country called the Konkan, which borders 
on it and extends through a part of the Asiatic continent, stretch- 
ing right up to China. Around the kingdom of the Ballahra there 
are a number of kings with whom it is in a state of war, but it is 
always victorious. Among the enemy kings there is one called 
the king of Gujra. He commands an important army. No other 
Indian king has a cavalry comparable to his. The king of Gujra 
is the enemy of the Arabs, but he recognizes, however, that the 
king of the Arabs is the greatest of kings. No king of India hates 
Islam as much as he. He reigns over a strip of land. He possesses 
great riches, camels and beasts in great number. (In his country) 
buying is done with bullion-money. It is said that mines of this 
metal are found there. There is no country in India where one is 
better protected from robbers. 3 

—Op. cit pp. 47-9. 

3. This is what MasudI (d. 956 A.D.) says on the Balhara : 

“The greatest of the kings of India in our time is the Balhara, sovereign 
of the city of Mankir. Many of the kings of India turn their faces towards 
him in their prayers, and they make supplications to his ambassadors, who 
come to visit them. The kingdom of Balhara is bordered by many other 
countries of India. Some kings have their territory in the mountains away 
from the sea, like the Rai, King of Kashmir, the King of Tafan, and others. 
There are other kings who possess both land and sea. The capital of the 
Balhara is eighty Sindi parasangs from the sea, and the parasang is equal 
to eight miles. His troops and elephants are innumerable, but his troops 
are mostly infantry, because the seat of his government is among the moun- 
tains. One of the neighbouring kings of India, who is far from the sea, 
is the Bauura, who is lord of the city of Kanauj . This is the title given 
to all the sovereigns of that kingdom. He has large armies in garrisons on 
the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, for he is surround- 
ed on all sides by warlike kings.” (Elliot and Dowson i. p. 21 ; see also 
Ferrand: Relations, i, p. 94). The king is uniformly called Balhara and 
his capital Mankir by the Arab writers. There is no doubt that Balhara 
stands for VaUabha, i.e., here Rastrakuta and Mankir for Malkhed, 
the Manyakheta of the South Indian Inscriptions . The Rastrakutas were 
the most powerful Western Indian dynasty in the ninth and tenth centuries. 
Of. Ferrand, op. cit. n. 3 at p. 94 citing MasudI himself in support of this 
view; contra the note on Balhara, Elliot and Dowson, i.pp.354-8, which must * 
now be taken to be antiquated.

C. Royal Funeral in Ceylon 

When the king of Sirandib (Ceylon) dies his corpse is laid on 
a chariot near the ground. The corpse is tied to the back of the 
chariot, the legs in the air, the back against the chariot (facing be- 
hind) so that the hair trails in the dust on the ground. A woman 
throws dust on the royal head with a broom in her hand, and says 
to the people met for the occasion : “ Eh! you! this was your king 
yesterday, he governed you and his order was absolute. He has 
come to the state of renouncing the goods of this world as you see 
him. The angel of death has taken his soul Be no more hence- 
forward seduced by the pleasures of this life.” And she continues 
to speak in the same sense for three days (sic). Then a funeral 
pyre is prepared on which is put sandal, camphor and -saffron. The 
body is burnt and its ashes are thrown to the winds. All the 
inhabitants of India bum their dead. 

Ceylon is the most southern among the islands of India, of 
which it is a part. Sometimes when the corpse of the king is burnt 
his wives throw themselves into the fire, and burn themselves with 
him ; but they may not do it. 

— Op. cit pp. 64-6. 

D. Ascetics 

There are in India some people who consecrate themselves to 
a life of wandering in the woods and the mountains. They rarely 
frequent men. They live on herbs and wild fruits from time to 
time. These recluses put an iron ring to the organ to prevent all 
sexual relationships with women. Some of them are nude ; others 
stand facing the sun, equally nude, but covered by some panther 
skins. I have seen one of them in the state that I have just said (in 
a certain place) then I continued my way. Sixteen years later I 
went again by the same place, and I saw this ascetic in the same 
state. I was astonished that his eye had not been destroyed by 
the heat of the sun. 

—Op. cit p. 66. 

E. Marriage 

In India and in China when one wants to get married (the 
interested families) pay mutual compliments and give presents to 
each other. Then the marriage is celebrated to the sound of 
cymbals and drums. The presents exchanged on this occasion 
consist of sums of money which are proportionate to the wealth 
of the givers. If a man and a woman are convicted of adultery,

both are put to death, (such is the law) in the whole of India ; 
but if the man has violated the woman, only he is put to death. 
If the woman has acted with full consent she is put to death with 
her paramour. 

— Op. cit. p. 67. 

F. Houses 

The walls of the Chinese houses are of wood, the Indians con- 
struct their houses with stones, plaster and bricks baked in the 
fire and with clay. Sometimes in China also they build just like 
this. 

— Op. cit p. 68. 

G. Food, Worship > etc.— Comparisons 

The Indians eat rice, the Chinese wheat and rice. The Indians 
do not eat wheat. Neither the Indians nor the Chinese are cir- 
cumcised. 

The Chinese adore idols. They pray to them as Mussalmans 
pray to Allah. They address to them prayers. They possess reli- 
gious books. 

The Indians allow their beard to grow long. I have seen 
them sometimes having a beard three cubits long. They do not 
trim their moustaches (like the Mussalmans). The greater num- 
ber of the Chinese have no beard, and for the greater part of them 
this is their natural condition. In India when a man dies the hair 
and the beard are shaved. 

t % * 

The Chinese and the Indians claim that their idols in the 
temples speak to them. But it is the priests (officiating ministers) 
of the temples that speak to them (and make them think the idols 
speak) . 

In China and in India, they kill animals to eat them, but they 
do not butcher them (so as to let the blood flow, as do the Mussal- 
mans). They beat them on the head till they are dead. In India 
and in China they do not take a bath after a serious pollution 
(that which results from sexual relations), like the Mussalmans. 
The Chinese do not wash after going to stool. They just wipe 
themselves with paper. The Indians purify themselves each day 
by bathing before the morning meal, and then they eat 

The Indians do not have any sexual relationships with their 
women during the menstrual period. They make them go out of

127 


their houses to avoid being polluted by them. The Chinese on the 
contrary have relations with their women during the menstrual 
period, and they do not make them leave their houses. 

The Indians clean their teeth (with their tooth picks). No 
one in India would eat without cleaning his teeth and purifying 
himself by bath. The Chinese do not do thus. 

India is more extensive than China. Its area is double that of 
China. It has a greater number of kings than China, but the latter 
is more thickly populated. 

Neither China nor India has the date-tree ; but they have 
other trees, and fruits we do not have are gathered in. In India 
there is no grape. There is a little in China. India and China 
produce other fruits in plenty. Pomegranates are found in India 
in abundance. 

The Chinese have no religious science. The practices of their 
religion (Buddhism) are derived from India. They believe that 
it is the Indians who brought idols to them and that the latter were 
their religious educators. In China and in India they believe in 
metempsychosis. The Chinese and Indians draw from the same 
religious principles different conclusions. 

In India medicine and philosophy are practised. The Chinese 
practise medicine equally. Their chief treatment is cauterization. 

The Chinese practise astronomy but the Indians practise this 
science still more. 

No Chinese or Indian Mussalman is known who does not speak 
Arabic. 

In India there are few horses ; there are more in China. In 
China there are no elephants. They are not allowed to penetrate 
into the country because they are animals of bad omen. 

The armies of the king of India are numerous, but they receive 
nothing for their maintenance, neither food nor pay. 

The king only convokes them in case of holy war. The troops 
then take the field and realize for themselves the cost of their 
maintenance. The king furnishes them nothing for this purpose. 
In China the troops receive the same pay as the troops of the Arabs. 

China is a brighter and more flourishing, country (than India).. 
In the greater part of India there are no towns (the country is 
desert). In China on the contrary there is in each place a big 
fortified town. In China the climate is healthier, and sicknesses 
less numerous than -in India. The air is so pure. There one does

not see either blind or one-eyed people nor deformed people. The 
infirm of this sort are numerous in India. 

In China and in India there are everywhere great rivers, big- 
ger ones than ours. It rains abundantly in these countries. 

There are in India many deserts, in China the whole country 
is inhabited and cultivated. The Chinese are better made than 
the Indians. The clothing and the beasts of burden of the Chinese re- 
semble more those of the Arabs than of the Indians, In costume 
and in the official processions the Chinese resemble the Arabs ; 
they put on the costume called kabd by the Arabs and the sash. 
The Indians clothe themselves with two cloths. Men and women 
adorn themselves with bracelets of gold and precious stones.

When they mount on the throne, some kings of India cause 
rice to be cooked which is then presented to them on the leaves of 
the banana. The king musters (on this occasion) three or four 
hundred friends (who attach themselves to him) by deliberate 
design, freely, without any one being forced to it. After eating of 
the rice himself, the king gives of it to his friends, and each one of 
them, in his turn, goes near (him), takes a little of the rice and 
eats it. When the king dies or is killed, all those who have eaten 
of the rice (with him in this sort of religious communion which 
binds them intimately), should burn themselves voluntarily on a 
pyre, to the last man, on the very day when the king ceases to live, 
(The king deajd, his friends should disappear) without delay. This 
obligation js so imperative that there should remain nothing of 
these friends, neither body nor trace of themselves.

4, Cf. the following curious account from The Book of the Marvels of 
India of about the same period : — 

Touching singular customs, widespread throughout India, Hassan, son 
of Amr, tells me that he heard a sheik, a well-informed man, who had 
travelled the country, relate the story, which follows./ 

One of the great kings of India was sitting down, taking a meal. Before 
Mm was a parrot in its cage. Said the king; “Come and eat with me” 
“I am frightened of cats” replied the parrot. “No matter” answered the 
king. “I will be your balaudjer ■ that is to say, in the Indian tongue, “I 
engage myself to suffer the like of anything that may happen to you.” And 
this is how the above expression was explained by the old man. The kings 
of India have about their persons a company of men, which is more or less

I. Miscellaneous 

The kings of India wear ear-rings of precious stones mounted 
on gold. They wear round the neck collars of great value made of 
precious stones, red (rabies) and green (emeralds) ; but pearls 
have the greatest value and in most cases they are used. In fact, 
pearls constitute the treasure of the kings and their financial re- 
serve. 


numerous, according to their degree of magnificence and the consequence ' of 
their state. These men say to the king : “ We are your balaudjers He makes 
them eat rice with him, and gives them betel from his own hand. Each hacks 
off his little linger, and sets it before the king. And from that moment on, 
they follow him about, wherever he goes, eat what he eats and drink what he 
drinks. They superintend his food, and overlook everything which has to do 
with Mm. No concubine is brought to his bed, whether it be girl or boy, but 
they, first of all, examine them thoroughly ; no carpet is spread for his feet, 
till they have inspected it. The king is served with no drink nor dish, but 
they insist it should be, first of all, tasted by whoever brings it. And thus 
they do, in every instance, where the king might be exposed to some danger. 
If he dies, they commit suicide ; if he burns, they cast themselves into the 
flames ; if he falls ill, they mishandle themselves in order to share his suffer- 
ings. When a battle is fought, in the attack, they cluster round him and never 
leave his side. Only men of distinguished family, who are themselves comely 
and valiant and of good understanding, are admitted among the balaudjers. 
And that is how the word baldudjer is explained. 

So when the king said to the parrot “ I am your baldudjer” he also took 
and ate a little of the parrot’s rice. And, without hesitation, the bird hopped 
down from his cage, and set himself at table with the king. Along came a 
cat and snapped off the parrot’s head. The king took the parrot’s dead body, 
and laid it in a porcelain vase, together with camphor, aromatic spices, betel, 
chalk, and pepper. Then he beat on a drum, and traversed the city and the 
ranks of his army, carrying this vase in Ms hand. And, thereafter, so he did 
every day, going through his dominions with the vase. And this went on lor 
years. At last, his balaudjers and other important subjects of the kingdom 
approached him and said : “ Your behaviour is unseemly. It has gone on too 
long. Do your duty, or we shall be obliged to arrange for your deposition 
and take another king.” And, in fact, whoever says, “I am your baldudjer” 
and fails to comply with the obligations he has thus imposed upon himself, 
such a man becomes, according to the usage of the Hindus, hahinda or ahinda , 
which, in their parlance, is the name given to any man who, by reason of 
weakness, inability, or baseness of spirit, does not fulfil his obligations. Kings 
are no more exempt from this rule, than other men. 

So, when the king saw this, he dug a pit and filled it with aloes wood, 
sandal, salit, set fire to it and flung himself therein. He was burned, and his 
balaudjers jumped in and were burned with him, to the number of some two 
thousand. And thus it came about, all because the king had said to his parrot: 
w I will be your baldudjer” (pp. 99 to 101) .

There is, in India, a caste the members of which will not eat

XX. C. 1030 A.D. ALBERUNI 


The southern frontier of India is formed by the ocean. The 
coast of India begins with Tiz, the capital of Makran, and extends 
thence in a south-eastern direction towards the region of Al-daibal, 
over a distance of 40 farsakh. 1 Between the two places lies the Gulf 
of Turin. A gulf is like an angle or a winding line of water pene- 
trating from the ocean into the continent, and is dangerous for navi- 
gation, specially on account of ebb and flood. An estuary is some- 
thing similar to a gulf, but is not formed by the ocean’s penetrating 
into the continent. It is formed by an expanse of flowing water, 
which there is changed into standing water and is connected with 
the ocean. These estuaries, too, are dangerous for the ships, because 
the water is sweet and does not bear heavy bodies as well as salt 
water does. 

After the above-mentioned gulf follow the small Munha, 2 the 
great Munha, then the Bawarij, i.e., the pirates of Kacch and Soma- 
nath. They are thus called because they commit their robberies on 
sea in ships called htra. The places on the coast are: Tawalleshar , 
50 farsakh from Daibal; 3 Loharam , 12 farsakh; Baga , 12 farsakh; 
Kacch , where the mufei-t ree grows, and Baron 4 6 farsakh; Somandth , 
14 farsakh ; Kanhdyat , 5 6 30 farsakh; Asawil , 2 days; Bihroj® 30 far- 
sakh (?); Sanddn, 50 farsakh; Subaru f 7 6 farsakh; Tana, 5 farsakh. 

Thence the coast-line comes to the country Ldrdn , in which lies 
the city of Jimur, then to Vallabha , Kdnji, Darvad. Next follows 
a great bay in which Singaldtb lies, i.e., the island Sarandlb 
(Ceylon) . Round the bay lies the city of Panjaydvar 8 (sic). When 
this city had fallen into ruins, the king, Jaur, built instead of it, on 
the coast towards the west, a new city which he called Padnar . 

The next place on the coast is IJmmalndra, then Ramsh&r 
(Rameshar?) opposite Sarandib ; the distance of the sea between

them is 12 farsakh. The distance from Panjayavar to Ramsher Is 
40 farsakh , that between Ramsher and Setubandha 2 farsakh. Setu- 
bandha means bridge of the ocean. It is the dike of Rama, the son 
of Dasaratha, which he built from the continent to the castle Lanka. 
At present it consists of isolated mountains between which the ocean 
flows. Sixteen farsakh from Setubandha towards the east is Kih - 
kind, 9 the mountains of the monkeys. Every day the king of the 
monkeys comes out of the thicket together with his hosts, and settles 
down in particular seats prepared for them. The 
KXHKOT 3 inhabitants of that region prepare for them cooked 

rice, and bring it to them on leaves. After having 
eaten it they return into the thicket, but in case they 
are neglected, this would be the ruin of the country, as they are 
not only numerous, but also savage and aggressive. According to 
the popular belief, they are a race of men changed into monkeys on 
account of the help which they had afforded to Rama when making 
war against the demons ; he is believed to have bequeathed those 
villages to them as legacy. When a man happens to fall in with 
them, and he recites to them the poetry of Rama and pronounces 
the incantations of Rama, they will quietly listen to him : they will 
even lead on the right path him who has gone astray and give him 
meat and drink. At all events, thus the matter stands according to 
popular belief. If there is any truth in this, the effect must be pro- 
duced by the melody, the like of which we have already mentioned 
in connection with the hunting of gazelles.

XXII. C. 1170 A.D. BENJAMIN OF TUDELA 


This Jewish traveller from Spain, relates that about the middle 
of the twelfth century A.D., the island of Kish marked the limit of 
the voyages of Indian merchants trading with 
kish Persia and the West. Kish, he says, is “a con- 

siderable market, being the point to which Indian 
merchants and those of the island bring their commodities ; 
while the traders of Mesopotamia, Yemen and Persia import all sorts 
of silk and purple cloths, flax, cotton, hemp, mash (a kind of pea) , 
wheat, barley, millet, rye and all sorts of comestibles and pulse, 
which articles form objects of exchange ; those from India import 
great quantities of spices, and the inhabitants of the island live by 
what they gain in their capacity of brokers to both parties. The 
island contains about five hundred Jews.” 

Benjamin states that Chulam was seventeen days by sea from 
Kish; Chulam may therefore be Quilon or some other port more to 
the north on the West coast of India. Ritter says : ‘ Choulam is 

beyond doubt the Koulam of Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta.’ Of the 
people of this place and their government and comity, Benjamin 
observes : 

“ They are descendants of Khush, are addicted to astrology, and 
are all black. This nation is very trustworthy in matters of trade, 
and whenever foreign merchants enter their port, 
quilon ? three secretaries of the king immediately repair on 

board their vessels, write down their names and 
report them to him. The king thereupon grants them security for 
their property, which they may even leave in the open fields 
without any guard. 

“ One of the king’s officers sits in the market, and receives goods 
that may have been found anywhere, and which he returns to those 
applicants who can minutely describe them. This custom is observed 
in the whole empire of the king, 

“ From Easter to New Year (from April to October) during the 
whole of the summer the heat is extreme. From the third hour of 
the day (nine o’clock in the morning) people shut themselves up 
in their houses until the evening, at which time everybody goes out. 
The streets and markets are lighted up and the inhabitants employ 
all the night upon their business, which they are prevented from 
doing in the day time, in consequence of the excessive heat.

“ The pepper grows in this country ; the trees which bear this 
fruit are planted in the fields, which surround the towns, and every 
one knows his plantation. The trees are small and the pepper is 
originally white, but when they collect it, they put it into basins and 
pour hot water upon it ; it is then exposed to the heat of the sun 
and dried in order to make it hard and more substantial, in the 
course of which process it becomes of a black colour. 

“ Cinnamon, ginger, and many other kinds of spices also grow 
in this country. 

“The inhabitants do not bury their dead, but embalm them 
with certain spices, put them upon stools and cover them with cloths, 
every family keeping apart. The flesh dries upon 
the bones, and as these corpses resemble living embalming 
beings, every one of them recognises his parents 
and all the members of his family for many years to come.” 1 * *

1. Benjamin mentions further that ‘these people worship the smi\ and 

that there were among them 4 only about one hundred Jews, who are of black 

colour ; who are ‘ good men, observers of the law and possess Pentateuch, the 

Prophets and some little knowledge of the Thalmud and its decisions 9 . ’ His 

paragraphs on the * island of Khandy 5 * are no good and are not reproduced; 

he says there were 23,000 Jews there, which is not easy to believe. 


XXIIL C. 1225 AD. CHAU JU-KUA 
A. Si-lan ( Ceylon ) 

Sailing from Lan-wu-li, 1 one knows that one is nearing Si-lan 
by continual flashing of lightning. 

The king (of Si-lan) is black, his hair unkempt and his head 
uncovered. He wears no clothes but has a cotton cloth of different 
colours wrapped around him ; on his feet he wears sandals of red 
leather, tied with golden strings. When he goes forth he rides an 
elephant or is carried in a litter. All day he chews a paste of betel 
nut and pearl ashes. 

His palace is ornamented with cat’s-eyes, blue and red precious 
stones, cornelians and other jewels ; the very floor he walks upon 
is so ornamented. There is an eastern and western 
palace palace, and at each there is a golden tree, the 

trunk and branches all of gold, the flowers, 
fruit and leaves of cat’s-eyes, blue and red precious stones 
and such like jewels. At the foot of these trees are golden thrones 
with opaque glass screens. When the king holds his court he uses 
the eastern palace in the forenoon and the western in the afternoon. 
When (the king) is seated, the jewels flashing in the sunshine, the 
glass (screens) and the jewel-tree shining on each other, make it 
like the glory of the rising sun. 

Two attendants are always present holding a golden dish to 
receive the remains of the betel nut (paste) chewed by the king. 

The king’s attendants pay a monthly fee of one i 2 
betel of gold into the government treasury for the pri- 

vilege of getting the betel nut (paste) remains, for 
it contains “ plum flower”, camphor and all kinds of precious 
substances. 

The king holds in his hand a jewel five inches in diameter, 
which cannot be burnt by fire, and which shines in (the darkness 
of) night like a torch. The king rubs his face with it daily, and 
though he were passed ninety he would retain his youthful looks. 

The people of the country are very dark-skinned, they wrap 
a sarong round their bodies, go bare-headed and 
people bare-footed. They use their hands in taking up 

their food ; their household utensils are of copper.

There is (in this country of Si-lan) a mountain called Si-lun-tie, 3 
on the top of which there is a huge imprint of a man’s foot, over 
seven feet long, and a like imprint is visible in the water (of the 
sea) within a distance of over 300 li from the mountain. The forest 
trees on the mountain, little and big, all bend towards it (as if 
reverencing it) . 

Hie products (of Si-lan) include eat’s-eyes, red transparent 
glass, camphor, blue and red precious stones. The products of the 
soil are cardamoms, mu-lan bark 4 and both coarse 
and fine perfumes. Foreign traders exchange for products 
them sandal-wood, cloves, camphor, gold, silver, 
porcelain-ware, horses, elephants, and silk stuffs. 

This country sends a yearly tribute to San-fo-ts’i. 5

a month. 

The capital of the kingdom is styled Mie-a-mo, which has the 
same meaning as the Chinese expression li-ssi 7 

The ruler of the country has his body draped, but goes bare- 
footed. He wears a turban and a loin-cloth, both of white cotton 
cloth. Sometimes he wears a white cotton shirt 
with narrow sleeves. When going out he rides an ruler 
elephant, and wears a golden hat ornamented with 
pearls and gems. On his arm is fastened a band of gold, and 
around his leg is a golden chain.

goes forth, they first send an officer with an hundred soldiers and 
more to sprinkle the ground so that the gusts of wind may not

The people are very dainty in their diet ; they have a hundred 
ways of cooking their food, which varies every day. 

There is an officer called Han~lin who lays the viands and drinks 
before the king, and sees how much food he eats, regulating his diet 
so that he may not exceed the proper measure. Should the king 
fall sick through excess of eating, then (this officer) must taste his 
faeces and treat him according as he finds them sweet or bitter.

There is in this country a river of brackish water, which, at a 
certain point where its different channels meet, becomes very broad. 
At this point its banks are bold cliffs in the face of which sparks

fructify and produce small stones like eafs-eyes, clear and trans- 
lucid. They lie buried in holes in (these) hills until some day they 
are washed out by the rush of a flood, when the officials send men 
in little boats to pick them up. They are prized by the natives.

whence, looking eastward, the tomb of the Si-wang mu was about 100 1% from 
the ship.

As previously noted, great exaggeration is met with in all that has come 
down to us concerning this mission. It is said by. Ma-Twan-lin .and the Sung- 
shi that the king of Chu-lien sent the Emperor of China, among other presents, 
21000 ounces of pearls, 60 elephants’ tusks, and 60 catties of frankincense. The 
envoys’ gifts to the Emperor included 6600 ounces of pearls and 3300 catties 
of perfumes! v)-'-

“ In the tenth year signing (1077) they again sent tribute of 
native produce. The Emperor Shiin-tsung sent an officer of the 
Inner Department (i.e., a Chamberlain) to bid them welcome.” 

■ The remaining countries (of India), Nan-ni-hua-lo and others, 
are more than a hundred in number ; they are all included under 
the term of “Western” ( lit Western Heaven). 

Concerning Wang-sho-ch £ dng 20 tradition says that north of 
Kiau-chi (Tongking), “one comes to Ta-li (Yiin-nan), and west of 
Ta-li one comes to Wang-sho-ch £ ong in less than forty days’ 
journey.” 

Kia Tan in the Huang-hua-ssi (or si)~ta~ki, says that to go from 
An-nan to T £ ien-chu, there is an overland route which one can take 
to get there. Yet as Ta-mo came sailing across the sea to P £ an-yu 
(Canton), we may fairly ask whether the sea journey is not more 
expeditious than the long overland one. 

P £ 6ng~k £ ie-lo of the West has a capital called Ch £ a-na-ki. 27 The 
city walls are 120 U in circuit. The common people are combative 
and devoted solely to robbery. They use (pieces of) white conch 
shells ground into shape as money. The native products include 
fine swords, to f u-lo 2S cotton stuffs and common cotton cloth. 

Some say that the law of the Buddha originated in this country 
for Hiian-tsang, the master of the Tripitaka in the T’ang period, 
(when) he got the Buddhist Classics (to bring to China) had 
already reached the West. 

“ Nan-ni-hua-lo city 29 has a triple wall. The inhabitants morn- 
ing and evening bathe and besmear their bodies with yii-kin 
(turmeric) so as to look like golden coloured images (lit,, 
Buddhas).” A large proportion of them are called P £ o-lo-mon 
(Brahmans) , as they are geunine descendants of Fo. 30

XXIV. 1279-92 A.D. EMBASSIES BETWEEN CHINA 
AND SOUTH INDIA 

Possibly as a result of the arrival at the Mongol court in the 
7th moon of 1279 of missions from Ma’bar and Annam (Chan-ch’eng) 
which presented the emperor with a live elephant and a rhino- 
ceros, Yang Ting-pi, the able lieutenant of So-tu and now Comman- 
der-in-Chief in Kuang-tung with the title of Daruga, was appointed 
Imperial Commissioner in the 12th moon of the year (early part 
of 1280) with orders to proceed to Kulam (Quilon) to invite the 
ruler (Pi-na-ti) 1 to recognise Kublai as his liege lord and to send an 
envoy to China ; this he promised to do. 

In the- early autumn of 1280 (8th moon) missions arrived at the 
Mongol court from Annam and Ma’bar bearing memorials from 
their rulers to the Emperor in which they styled themselves “ Your 
servants,” thus recognizing him as their liege lord. They presented 
as tribute valuable presents and, as in 1279, an elephant and rhino- 
ceros. 2 This mission had been sent spontaneously by the legitimate 
sovereign of Ma’bar and before the arrival of Yang Ting-pi, the 
Icin g being most anxious to secure, by recognition of Chinese 
suzerainty, the protection of the Mongols against his domestic foes 
who were depriving him of all his power ; its leader was named 
Jumaluddin. 

Hardly had Yang Ting-pi returned from this mission when he 
was ordered to proceed again to Kulam and the adjacent countries. 
The narrative of his journey is given as follows in the Yuan shih. 

“ In the 10th moon (of the year 1280) the rank of Envoy to 
Kulam was given to Ha-sa-erh-hai-ya and he was sent, in company 
with Yang Ting-pi, to summon (the other countries adjacent to 
Kulam) to come to Court. They put to sea from Ch’uan-chou in 
the first moon of the 18th year, (about February, 1281) and after a 
voyage of three moons arrived in the island of Seng-kia-yeh 
(Ceylon). Cheng-ch§n and the other sailors persuaded them, in 
view of the contrary winds and their provisions run ning short, to 
make for Ma’bar, whence Kiilam could be reached by a land-route 
which they believed existed. In the 4th moon they landed from 

1. Pi-na-ti (di) may stand for an original Pandi or Pandya, the name of

2. This is evidently the mission referred to by the king of Ma'bar in the 
secret message he sent Yang Ting-pi in the 5th moon of 1281 ; he then stated 
that Cha-ma-li-ting (Jamaluddin) was his envoy.

their junk at the port of Hsin-tsun 3 (in Ma’bar) . Ma-yin-ti, the 
Minister of State (Vezir) of the country, said to the Chinese 
Officials : “ You are most welcome. Whenever our ships have been 
to Ch’iian-chou your officials have done their best to spare us all 
trouble and expense. What business has brought you here ? ” 
Yang Ting-pi and the others explained the purpose of their mission 
and all about the supposed route to Kiilam. Ma-yin-ti requested 
them, on the score of not fully understanding what they said, to 
see his Assistant (or Secretary) Pu-a-li (Abu Ali) , and to him they 
told about the reported road and their business. 

“ In the 5th moon two men came stealthily to the envoys’ lodg- 
ings, and keeping the people away (so that they could not be over- 
heard) said that, in view of their evident and sincere friendliness, 
they begged them to convey the following message (from the legi- 
timate king of Ma’bar) to the court of China . “ I am sincerely 

desirous of becoming the subject of the Emperor. My envoy 
Cha-ma-li-ting (Jumalucldin) has been received at your court. My 
Great Pi-she-ch’ih has gone to the Suan-tan (“ Lord 
of a kingdom ”) and asked for a change. The pandyan 
Suan-tan has sequestered my gold and my politics 
silver, my lands and my property. He has laid 
hold of my wives and seeks to put me to death, I have only been 
able to escape by deceiving him. At the present moment the Suan- 
tan and the (or his) brothers have met, all five of them together 
in one place, and are deliberating about fighting with (Kiilam) . 
When they heard of the coming of the Imperial envoys to raise me 
to the rank of a feudal prince of the Empire, they gave it out that 
this country is poor and lowly. This is false ; all the gold, pearls 
and precious things of the Moslim countries come from here, and 
all the Moslims come here to trade. All the kingdoms (of Southern 
India) will show their submissiveness if Ma’bar has once done so. 
My envoy ( Jumaluddin) bore a most submissive letter (in this 
sense) .” 4 

Ho-sa-erh-hai-ya and Yang Ting-pi having been prevented by 
contrary winds from going by sea to Kiilam (and being detained in 
Ma’bar) , Ho-sa-erh-hai-ya went back to the Court of China to

explain matters. (As a result of this) , when the northerly winds 
had set in, in the 11th moon (of 1281), the Emperor sent a messenger 
ordering Yang Ting-pi to proceed alone (to Kiilam, by the land- 
route ?) 

“ In the 2nd moon of the 19th year (1282) he arrived in the 
kingdom of Kiilam where the king 5 and his minister Mohammed and 
others received the Imperial letter with the Privy Seal with deep 
prostrations. In the third moon he ordered his minister Chu-a-li- 
sha-mang-li-pa-ti to depart with present to Court. At the same 
time (the head of the) Yeh-li-k J o-wen, 6 Wu-tsa-erh-sa-li-ma, and 
Mohammed, the head of the Mussulmans, and others of the country, 
having heard of the coming of the Imperial envoy, all came and 
requested that they be allowed to send yearly presents to Court. 
They therefore sent a representative to be received at the audience. 
Likewise the Kingdom of Su-mu-ta 7 sent a man; as a result of 
the lord of Kiilam having asked of Yang Ting-pi to offer his alle- 
giance, they all accepted the invitation.” 

In the 4th moon (of 1282) Yang Ting-pi started on the return 
journey (to China) . He came to the Kingdom of Na-wang 8 
where he again urged its ruler Mang-ang-pi to make his submission. 
Then they came to the Kingdom of Su-mu-tu-la 9 where the ruler 
of the Kingdom, the Tu-han-pa-ti welcomed the mission. Yang 
Ting-pi having exposed the general purpose of his mission, the 
Tuan-pati 10 on the same day made him presents, called himself 
“ feudatory ”, and dispatched his two ministers Hussein and Suli- 
man to Court. 

In the autumn of 1282 the envoys from Kulam, Na-wang, 
Su-mu-ta and Su-mu-tu-la arrived at Kublai’s court. The event 
is noted as follows in the Yuan shih :

Ting-pi, for the establishment of friendly relations with 
the barbarians outside of the sea (of China) , they arriv- 
ed at Court bearing tribute. The ruler of Kii-lan sent 

a mission with a memorial, and presented valuable arti- 
cles and one black ape. The lord of Na-wang, Mang-ang, 

there being no persons acquainted with the art of writing in his 
country, sent four persons but did not present a memorial. The 
ruler of Su-mu-tu-la, the Tu-han-pa-ti, likewise sent two men. 

“ As to Su-mu-ta the Prime Minister Na-li-pa-ho-la-nan- 
ch’ih, being (absent) in Kii-lan on business, requested instead 
his lord Ta-ku-erh to send an envoy with a memorial. He brought 
to court the signet ring (of the king ?) , brocaded silks and twenty 
brocaded coverlets. Wu-tsa-erh-p’ieh-li-ma, 11 the chief of the 
Yeh-li-k’o-wen (Thomas Christians) resident in the kingdom of 
Kii-lan, sent also a messenger with a memorial who presented a 
gorget set with different kinds of jewels, and two flacons of drugs. 
Furthermore Mohammed, the head official of the Mussulmans, also 
sent a messenger and a memorial.” 

In 1282, possibly after the return of Yang Ting-pi to China, 
another officer, the Uigur-I-hei-mi shih who already in 1272 and 
1275 had carried out successfully missions beyond 
the sea, and who at the time was assisting So-tu, buddha relics 
then Resident in Chan-ch’eng, in establishing 
Chinese suzerainty over that country, was detached from that 
duty by order of the Emperor and sent beyond the sea 
to Seng-kia-la (Ceylon) to examine the Buddha’s almsbowl and 
body relics ( sdrlra ). He made the journey but without accom- 
plishing the object for which he was sent which was to secure 
this priceless relic for the Emperor, for in 1287 he was again sent 
on a mission for the same purpose, as we shall see later on. 12 

Yang Ting-pi was not at the end of his travelling ; a few 
months after his return (in the 1st moon of the 20th year chih- 
yilan, January-February 1283) he was made Imperial Commis- 
sioner, honoured with imperial gifts of a bow and arrows, a saddle 
and bridle, and sent on a new mission to Kiilam and other states. 
He was also entrusted with a golden badge for Wa-ni, 13 king of

Kulam, on whom the Emperor conferred the ■ title of Fuma or 
“ Imperial Son-in-Law.” 

As a result of the missions of Yang Ting-pi and of the' friendly 
reception given the foreign envoys to Court in 1282, missions from 
the states of Southern India and the islands of the Archipelago 
became during the next few years more numerous. In the 5th 
moon of 1283 Seng-tso-yu-pan, an envoy of the king of Ma’bar, 
arrived at Court, and in the first moon of 1284 there came another 
who presented the Emperor with pearls, rare jewels and light 
silks. 

In the latter part of the same year, and in compliance with 
the commands brought them by an official named Pa-ko-lu-ssu sent 
by the Governor of Fu-kien, ministers of the four states of Nan- 
wu-li, Pieh-li-la, Li-lun, and Ta-li, 14 brought letters from their 
sovereigns and articles of tribute. 

The stories told by the missions from India, Indo-China, and 
the islands of the Archipelago, of the rare and precious products 
of their native lands, of the wondrous skill of their magicians and 
physicians, must have incited Kublai, ever desirous 
kxjblai’s aims . of adding to the magnificence of his Court and to 
the treasures from every land which he already 
possessed, to send mission after mission to these distant 
parts to learn more of them and to bring him of their 
strange birds and beasts, their jewels and their learned men. 
In the summer of 1285 we read that he despatched a certain Ma~ 
su-hu, and A-li to Ma'bar ‘ to look for rare and precious things/ 
supplying them with a large sum of money for that purpose. 

In 1282 the Uigur I-hei-mi-shih had been unable to bring 
from Ceylon the almsbowl of the Buddha and the sdrzra which Kub- 
lai had sent him there to procure. In 1287 the Emperor ordered the 
same officer to ‘proceed to Ma’bar to get these holy relics \ 15

and Sumatra which had been in China since the latter part of 
1286. 16 The voyage was a rough one, contrary winds so delayed

him that he was a year making the journey. Nor did he find the 
almsbowl or the relics he was sent to procure. He brought back, 
however, a skilled physician and most excellent drugs, and a 
number of people from Ma’bar who fetched presents to the Empe- 
ror, while he himself offered him red sandal-wood and building 
materials he had bought in India with his private funds. 
The mission appears to have been received in audience in the 3rd 
moon of 1288. As a reward for his services abroad, the Emperor 
raised him to the rank of Minister of State and made him Governor- 
General of Fu-kiem 17 

The largest mission which had yet visited the Mongol court 
from the countries of the South was that which arrived in 1286, 
It had in it representatives of ten states, all of them members of the 
reigning families . Of it we read that “ in the 9th moon of the 
23rd year ckth-yuan (1286) on the day yi-ch’oii being the first day 
of the moon, Ma-pa-erh, 18 Hsu-men-na, 19 Seng-ki-li, 20 Nan-wu-ii, 21 
Ma-lan-tan, 22 Na-wang, 23 Ting-ko-erh, Lai-lai, Ki-lan-i-tai and 
Sa-mu-tu-la, 24 ten kingdoms in all, each of which had sent either 
a son or a younger brother of its ruler with a letter to the Emperor, 
were received in audience and presented articles of tribute.” 

Three months later (1st moon 24th year) an envoy from 
Klilam, Pu-liu-wen-nai by name, and others were received 
in audience and in the 3rd moon the envoy from Ma’bar (presum- 
ably the same who had arrived in the autumn of the preceding 
year, but this is not quite clear) presented the Emperor with a 
strange animal, like a mule, but mottled black and white; it was 
called an a-fa-pi 

In 1288 a mission is said to have arrived at Court from Ma’bar, 
and in 1289 we read of Ma’bar presenting the Emperor with two 
zebras, and in the 8th moon of 1290 another envoy came to Court

In the same year 1290 {in the 4th moon) Sang-ki-la~shih and 
others were sent by Kublai to Ma’bar to search for clever jugglers : 
or, according to Gaiibil, : u for persons learned in sciences, 
for skilled workmen, soldiers and sailors, and interpreters 
for diverse languages.” 

Again the following year the Emperor sent people to Kiilam 
and to Ma’bar, but we learn nothing of the purpose of the mission.. 

In 1292 I-hei-mi-shih, the former envoy to Ceylon and Ma’bar, 
was appointed one of the generals in command of the punitive 
expedition against the state of Ko-lang in north- 
last missions eastern Java. On arriving with his fleet in 
Chang-ch’eng (Annam) , he despatched two officers, 
Ho Ch’eng and Liu Yuan, on a friendly mission to the little states 
of Nan-wu-li (Lambri), Su-mu-tu-la (Sumatra, Pu-lu-pu-tu and 
Pa-la-la ; all of them sent missions to the Mongol Court. 

Subsequent to these missions official intercourse with Ma’bar, 
Sumatra, and adjacent countries seems to have become of rare 
occurrence. In 1296 we hear of a mission under Yo-lo-yeh-nu 
being sent to Ma’bar, and in the following year T’a-hsi of Ma’bar 
was sent abroad and told to procure drugs, but we have to come 
down to 1314 to find mention of a mission from Ma’bar arriving at 
the Mongol court. In that year we hear that the king of Ma’bar 
Hsi-la-mu-ting 26 sent his minister Ai-ssu-ting with presents 
to Court. 

After this, thirty years appear to have elapsed before another 
mission was sent to Southern India, for it is only in the year 1344 
that mention is made of an envoy being sent to Kulam, when, as 
in 1283, he carried the king, or Wa-ni, a tiger-badge and the title 
of imperial son-in-law or fu-ma. With this official relations bet- 
ween the government of China and the peoples of southern India, 
Ceylon, and Sumatra seem to have come to an end, though com- 
mercial relations continued uninterruptedly and were of consider- 
able importance — though of much less volume and value than in

A. Concerning the island of Seilan 
(Ceylon) 

When you leave the island of Angamanain 1 and sail about a 
thousand miles in a direction a little south of west, you come to 
the island of Seilan, which is in good sooth the best island of its 
size in the" world. You must know that it has a compass of 2,400 
miles, but in old times it was greater still, for it then had a circuit 
of about 3600 miles, as you find in the charts of the mariners of 
* those seas. But the north wind there blows with such strength 
that it has caused the sea to submerge a large part of the Island ; 
and that is the reason why it is not so big now as it used to be. 
For you must know that, on the side where the north wind strikes, 
the Island is very low and flat, insomuch that in approaching on 
board ship from the high seas you do not see the land till you 
are right upon it. 2 Now I will tell you all about this island. 

They have a king there whom they call Sendemain, 3 and are 
tributary to nobody. The people are Idolaters, and go quite naked 
except that they cover the middle . They have no wheat but have 
rice, and sesamum of which they make their oil. They live on 
flesh and milk, and have tree-wine such as I have told you of. And 
they have brazil-wood, much the best in the world. 

Now I will quit these particulars, and tell you of the most 
precious article that exists in the world. You must know that 
rubies are found in this island and in no other 
country in the world but this. They find there precious 
also sapphires and topazes and amethysts, and stones 
many other stones of price. And the king of this 
island possesses a ruby which is the finest and biggest in the world; 
I will tell you what it is like..;- It is about a palm in length, and 
as thick as a man’s arm ; to look at, it is the most resplendent 
object upon earth; it is quite free from flaw and as red as fire. 
Its value is so great that a price for it in money could hardly be

named at all You must know that the Great Kaan sent 
an embassy and begged the King as a favour greatly desired by 
him to sell him this ruby, offering to give for it the ransom of a 
city, or in fact what the King would. But the king replied that on nc 
account whatever would he sell it, for it had come to him from his 
ancestors * 4

Furthermore you must know that in the Island of Sedan there 
is an exceeding high mountain ; it rises right 
adam’s peak up so steep and precipitous that no one 
could ascend it, were it not that they have 
taken and feed to it several great and massive iron chains, so 
disposed that by help of these men are able to mount to the top . 
And I tell you they say that on this mountain is the sepulchre of 
Adam our first parent ; 5 at least that is what the Saracens say. 
But the Idolaters say that it is the sepulchre of Sagamoni Borean, 
before whose time there were no idols. They hold him to have 
been the best of men, a great saint in fact, according to their fashion, 
and the first in whose name idols were made.

He was the son, as their story goes, of a great and wealthy 
king. And he was of such an holy temper that he would never 
listen to any worldly talk, nor would he consent 
sagamoni to be king. And when the father saw that his son 

would not be king, nor yet take any part in affairs, 
he took it sorely to heart. And first he 
tried to tempt him with great promises, offering to crown him king, 
and to surrender all authority into his hands. The son, however, 
would none of his offers ; so the father was in great trouble, 
and all the more that he had no other son but him, to whom he 
might bequeath the kingdom at his own death. So, after taking 
thought on the matter, the King caused a great palace to be built, 
and placed his son therein, and caused him to be waited ' on there 
by a number of maidens, the most beautiful that could anywhere

be found. And he ordered them to divert themselves with the 
prince, night and day, and to sing and dance before him, so as to 
draw his heart towards worldly enjoyments. But ’twas all of no 
avail, for none of those maidens could ever tempt the king’s son to 
any wantonness, and he only abode the firmer in his chastity, 
leading a most holy life, after their manner thereof. And 1 assure 
you he was so staid a youth that he had never gone out of the 
palace, and thus he had never seen a dead man, nor any one who 
was not hale and sound ; for the father never allowed any man 
that was aged or infirm to come into his presence. It came to pass 
however one day that the young gentleman took a ride, and by the 
roadside he beheld a dead man. The sight dismayed him greatly, 
as he never had seen such a sight before. Incontinently 
he demanded of those who were with him what thing that was ? 
and then they told him it was a dead man. “ How, then,” quoth 
the king’s son, “do all men die?” “Yea, forsooth,” said they. 
Whereupon the young gentleman said never a word, but rode on 
right pensively. And after he had ridden a good way he fell in 
with a very aged man who could no longer walk, and had not a 
tooth in his head, having lost all because of his great age. And 
when the king’s son beheld this old man he asked what that might 
mean, and wherefore the man could not walk ? Those who were 
with him replied that it was through old age the man could walk 
no longer, and had lost all his teeth. And so when the king’s son 
had thus learned about the dead man and about the aged man, he 
turned back to his palace and said to himself that he would abide 
no longer in this evil world, but would go in search of Him Who 
dieth not, and Who had created him. 

So what did he one night but take his departure from the 
palace privily, and betake himself to certain lofty and pathless 
mountains. And there he did abide, leading a life of great hard- 
ship and sanctity, and keeping great abstinence, just as if he had 
been a Christian. Indeed, as he had but been so, he would have 
been a great saint of Our Lord Jesus Christ, so good and pure was 
the life he led. And when he died they found his body and brought 
it to his father. And when the father saw dead before him that 
son whom he loved better than himself, he was near going dis- 
traught with sorrow. And he caused an image in the similitude of 
his son to be wrought in gold and precious stones, and caused all 
his people to adore it. And they all declared him to be a god ; and 
so they still say. 

They tell moreover that he had died fourscore and four times. 
The first time he died as a man, and came to life again as an ox ;

and then he died as an ox and came to life 
jataka tales again as a horse, and so on until he had died four-

they say he became a god. And they do hold him for the greatest

originated all the other idols. And this befel in the Island of 
Seilan in India . 6 

The Idolaters come thither on pilgrimage from very long dis- 
tances and with great devotion, just as Christians go to the shrine 
of Messer Saint James in Gallicia. And they maintain that the 
monument on the mountain is that of the king's son, according to 
the story I have been telling you ; and that the teeth, and the hair, 
and the dish that are there were those of the same king’s son, 
whose name was Sagamoni Borcan, or Sagamoni the Saint. But 
the Saracens also come thither on pilgrimage in great numbers, 
and they say that it is the sepulchre of Adam our first father, and 
the teeth, and the hair, and the dish were those of Adam . 7

Among remarkable islands, in all the sea there is none like the 
Island of Serendib, also called Sehilan (Ceylon) . It is an hundred parasangs 
long, and the circumference is three hundred parasangs . There they fish 
pearls of fine water, but little; big pearls, when they happen upon them, are of 
inferior quality. And there is a mountain, called Hasin, a mountain of jar- 
goon and diamonds. And there it was, so they say, that Adam stepped 
down, and you can view his footprint, which is seventy cubits long. The 
inhabitants are they who declare that this is Adam’s footprint, and that the 
blessed patriarch set one foot on that spot and the other in the sea. In 
the same island is found a red earth, which is the senadidj, used for 
polishing rock-crystal and glass. Its trees yield excellent cinnamon bark, the 
famous Singalese cinnamon. The grass is red, and employed in dyeing stuffs 
and cotton thread; it makes a better dye than that of baqqam, 
saffron, safflower, or any other kind of red dye. And the island bears many 
another remarkable plant, which it would take too long to catalogue. They 
aver that the Island of Serendib contains some hundred thousand town- 
ships.

Whose they were in truth, God knoweth ; howbeit, according to 
the Holy Scripture of our Church, the sepulchre of Adam is not 
in that part of the world. 

Now it befel that the Great Kaan heard how on that mountain 
there was the sepulchre of our first father Adam, and that some 
of his hair and of his teeth, and the dish from 
which he used to eat, were still preserved there. So embassy from 
he thought he would get hold of them somehow or kublai khan 
another, and despatched a great embassy for 
the purpose, in the year of Christ, 1284 . The ambassadors, with a 
great company, travelled on by sea and by land until they arrived 
at the island of Seilan, and presented themselves before the king. 
And they were so urgent with him that they succeeded in getting 
two of the grinder teeth, which were passing great and thick ; and 
they also got some of the hair and the dish from which that per- 
sonage used to eat, which is of a very beautiful green porphyry. 
And when the Great Kaan’s ambassadors had attained the object 
for which they had come they were greatly rejoiced, and returned 
to their lord. And when they drew near to the great city of 
Cambaluc, where the Great Kaan was staying, they sent him word 
that they had brought back that for which he had sent them. On 
learning this the Great Kaan was passing glad, and ordered all 
the ecclesiastics and others to go forth to meet these reliques, 
which he was led to believe were those of Adam. 

And why should I make a long story of it ? In sooth, the 
whole population of Cambaluc went forth to meet those reliques, 
and the ecclesiastics took them over and carried them to the Great 
Kaan, who received them with great joy and reverence. And they 
find it written in their Scriptures that the virtue of that dish is 
such that if food for one man be put therein it shall become enough 
for five men ; and the Great Kaan averred that he had proved the 
thing and found that it was really true. ’ 

So now you have heard how, the Great Kaan came by those 
reliques ; and a mighty treasure it did cost him ! The reliques 
being, according to the Idolaters, those of that king’s son.

India the Greater , and is on the mainland. 

When you leave the Island of Seilan and sail westward about 
60 miles, you come to the great province of Maabar which is styled

India the Greater ; 8 9 it is best of all the Indies and Is on the main- 
land. 

You must know that in this province there are five kings, who 
are own brothers. I will tell you about each in turn. The Pro- 
vince is the finest and noblest in the world. 

At this end of the Province reigns one of those five Royal 
Brothers, who is a crowned King, and his name is 
the fandyas sonder bandi DAVAR. In his kingdom they find very 
fine and great pearls ; and I will tell you how they 

are got. 

You must know that the sea here forms a gulf between the 
Island of Seilan and the mainland. And all round this gulf the 
water has a depth of no more than 10 or 
pearl-fishing 12 fathoms, and in some places no more 
than two fathoms. The pearl-fishers take their 
vessels, great and small, and proceed into this gulf, where they 
stop from the beginning of April till the middle of May. They 
go first to a place called bettelar , 0 and (then) go 60 miles into 
the gulf. Here they cast anchor and shift from their large vessels 
into small boats. You must know that the many merchants who 
go divide into various companies, and each of these must engage 


8. Abulfeda names Cape Comorin as the point where Malabar ended and 
Maabar began. Marco’s account of Maabar can be usefully compared with 
Wassafs slightly later account: 

“ Ma‘bar extends in length from Kulam to Nilayvar (Nellore) , nearly three 
hundred parasangs along the sea- coast, and in the language of that country 
the king is called Dewar, which signifies the Lord of Empire. The curiosities 
of Chin and Machin, and the beautiful products of Hind and Sind, laden on 
large ships (which they call junks) , sailing like mountains with the wings of 
the winds on the surface of the water, are always arriving there. The wealth 
of the isles of the Persian Gulf in particular, and in part the beauty and adorn- 
ment of other countries, from 4 Irak and Khurasan as far as Rum and Europe, 
are derived from Ma‘bar, which is so situated as to be the key of Hind. 

“ A few years since the Dewar was Sundar Pandi, who had three brothers, 
each of whom established himself in independence in some different country. 
The eminent prince, the margrave ( marzban ) of Hind, Takiu-d din ‘Abdur 
Rahman, son of Muhammad-ut-Tibi, whose virtues and accomplishments have 
for a long time been the theme of praise and admiration among the chief in- 
habitants of that beautiful country, was the Dewar’s deputy, minister, and 
adviser, and was a man of sound judgment. Fitan, Mali Fitan and Kabil were 
made over to his possession, for he is still worthy (kabil) of having the Khutba 
read in his name, and, notwithstanding these high dignities, is not worthy of 
seditions (fitna) (cf. Rashid-ud-din in Elliot and Dowson, i, pp. 69-70).

a number of men on wages, hiring them for April and half of May. 
Of all the produce they have first to pay the king, as his royalty, 
the tenth part. And they must also pay those men who charm the 
great fishes, to prevent them from injuring the divers whilst en- 
gaged in seeking pearls under water, one twentieth part of all that 
they take. These fish-charmers are termed Abraiaman ; 10 and 
their charm holds good for that day only, for at night they dissolve 
the charm so that the fishes can work mischief at their will. These 
Abraiaman know also how to charm beasts and birds and every liv- 
ing thing. . When the men have got into the small boats they jump 
into the water and dive to the bottom, which may be at a depth of 
from 4 to 12 fathoms, and there they remain as long as they are able. 
And there they find the shells that contain the pearls (and these 
they put into a net bag tied round the waist, and mount up to the 
surface with them, and then dive anew. When they can’t hold their 
breath any longer they come up again, and after a little down they 
go once more, and so they go on all day) . The shells are in fashion 
like oysters or sea-hoods. And in these shells are found pearls, 
great and small, of every kind, sticking in the flesh of the shell-fish. 

In this manner pearls are fished in great quantities, for thence 
in fact come the pearls which are spread all over the world. And I 
can tell you the King of that State hath a very great receipt and 
treasure from his dues upon those pearls. 

As soon as the middle of May is past, no more of those pearl- 
shells are found there. It is true, however, that a long way from 
that spot, some 300 miles distant, they are also found; but that is in 
September and the first half of October.

never a. Tailor 11 to cut a coat or stitch it, seeing 
that everybody goes naked ! For decency only do clothes

wrote, not more than one authenticated accident from sharks had taken place, 
during the whole period of the British occupation.’— Yule. Buzurg 
Ibn Shahriyar ( The Marvels of India , pp. 135-7) narrates how such a charm 
came to bind the crocodiles in the port of Serira permanently because its king 
had the head of the charmer chopped off before he could remove the spell.

men and women, with rich and poor, aye, and with the 
King himself, except what I am going to mention. 

It is a fact that the King goes as bare as the rest, only round 
his loins he has a piece of fine cloth, and round his neck he has a 
necklace entirely of precious stones, — rubies, 
royal sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch that 

jewellery this collar is of great value. He wears also hanging 

in front of his chest from the neck downwards, a fine 
silk thread strung with 104 large pearls and rubies of great price. 
The reason why he wears this cord with the 104 great pearls and 
rubies is (according to what they tell) that every day morning and 
evening, he has to say 104 prayers to his idols. Such is their reli- 
gion and their custom. And thus did all the Kings his ancestors 
before him, and they bequeathed the string of pearls to him that he 
should do the like. (The prayer that they say daily consists of 
three words, Pacauta! Pacauta! Pacauta! And this they repeat 
104 times). 12 

The King aforesaid also wears on his arms three golden brace- 
lets thickly set with pearls of great value, and anklets also of like 
kind he wears on his legs, and rings on his toes likewise. So let 
me tell you what this king wears, between gold and gems and pearls, 
is worth more than a city’s ransom. And J tis no wonder ; for he 
hath great store of such gear ; and besides they are found in his 
kingdom. Moreover nobody is permitted to take out of the kingdom 
a pearl weighing more than half a saggiop unless he manages to do 
it secretly. This order has been given because the King desires to 
reserve all such to himself ; and so in fact the quantity he has is 
something almost incredible. Moreover several times every year 
he sends his proclamation through the realm that if any one who 
possesses a pearl or stone of great value will bring it to him, he will 
pay for it twice as much as it cost. Everybody is glad to do this, 
and thus the King gets all into his own hands, giving every man his 
price. 

Furthermore, this king hath some five hundred wives, for when- 
ever he hears of a beautiful damsel he takes her to wife. Indeed he

did a very sorry deed as I shall tell you. For 

seeing that his brother had a handsome wife, THE 

he took her by force and kept for himself. 

His brother, being a discreet man, took the thing quietly and 
made no noise about it. The King hath many children. 

And there are about the King a number of Barons in attend- 
ance upon him. These ride with him, and keep always near him, 
and have great authority in the kingdom ; they 
are called the King’s Trusty Lieges. And body-guard 

you must know that when the King dies, 

and they put him on the fire to burn him, these Lieges cast them- 
selves into the fire round about his body, and suffer themselves to 
be burnt along with him. For they say they have been his comrades 
in this world, and that they ought also to keep him company in the 
other world . 14 

When the King dies none of his children dares to touch his 
treasure . 15 For they say, “ as our father did gather 
together all this treasure, so we ought to accumu- treasure 
late as much in our turn.” And in this way it 
comes to pass that there is an immensity of treasure accumulated 
in this kingdom.

15. Wassaf on the share of the king and his ministers in treasure and trade 
of the country is instructive: 

“ In the months of the year 692 H. the above-mentioned Dewar, the ruler 
of Ma’bar, died, and left behind him much wealth and treasure. It is related 
by Malik -ul -Islam Jamal -ud- din, that out of that treasure 7,000 oxen, laden 
with precious stones, and pure gold and silver, fell to the share of the brother 
who succeeded him. Malik-i a‘zam Taki-ud din continued prime minister as 
before, and, in fact, ruler of that kingdom, and his glory and magnificence 
were raised a thousand times higher. 

“Notwithstanding the immense wealth acquired by trade, he gave orders 
that whatever commodities and goods were imported from the remotest parts 
of China and Hind into Ma'bar, his agents and factors should be 
allowed the first selection, until which no one else was allowed to 
purchase. When he had selected his goods he despatched them on his own 
ships, or delivered them to merchants and ship owners to carry to the island 
of Kais. There also it was not permitted to any merchant to contract a bargain 
until the factors of Maliku-1 Islam had selected what they required, and after 
that the merchants were allowed to buy whatever was suited to the wants of 
Ma’bar. Hie remnants were exported on ships and beasts of burden to the 
isles of the sea, and the countries of the east and west, and with the prices 
obtained by their sale such goods were purchased as were suitable for the

Here are no horses bred ; and thus a great part of the wealth 
of the country is wasted in purchasing horses; I will tell you how. 
You must know that the merchants of kis and 
horse-trade hohmes, dqfar and soer and aden collect great 
number of destriers and other horses, and 
these they bring to the territories of this King 16 and of 
his four brothers, who are kings likewise as I told you. For a horse 
will fetch among them 500 saggi 17 of gold, worth more than 100 
marks of silver, and vast numbers are sold there every year. 
Indeed this King wants to buy more than 2,000 horses every year, 
and so do his four brothers who are kings likewise. The reason 
why they want so many horses every year is that by the end of the 


home market ; and the trade was so managed that the produce of the remotest 
China was consumed in the farthest west. No one has seen the like of it in 
the world. 

Nobility arises from danger, for the interest is ten in forty ; 

If merchants dread risk they can derive no profit. 

As the eminent dignity and great power of Malik-i a’zam Takiu-d din, and 
Maliku~l Islam Jamalu-d din were celebrated in most parts of Hind to even 
a greater extent than in Ma’bar, the rulers of distant countries have cultivated 
and been strengthened by their friendship, and continually kept up a corre- 
spondence with them, expressing their solicitations and desires.” — Elliot and 
Dowson, iii. pp. 34-5. 

16. Wassaf gives very interesting and important details of the horse trade 
in his time : 

** It was a matter of agreement that Maliku-l Islam Jamalu-d din and the 
merchants should embark every year from the island of Kais and land at 
Ma’bar 1,400 horses of his own breed, and of such generous origin that, in 
comparison with them the most celebrated horses of antiquity, such as the 
Rukhs of Rustam, etc., should be as worthless as the horse of the chess-board. 
It was also agreed that he should embark as many as he could procure from all 
the isles of Persia, such as Katif, Lahsa, Bahrein, Hurmuz, and Kulhatu. The 
price of each horse was fixed from of old at 220 dinars of red gold, on this 
condition, that if any horses should sustain any injury during the voyage, or 
should happen to die, the value of them should be paid from the royal trea- 
sury. It is related by authentic writers, that in the reign of Atabak Abu Bakr, 
10,000 horses were annually exported from these places to Ma’bar, Kambayat, 
and other ports in their neighbourhood, and the sum total of their value 
amounted to 2,200,000 dinars, which was paid out of the overflowing revenues 
of the estates and endowments belonging to the Hindu temples, and from the 
tax upon courtezans attached to them, and no charge was incurred by the 
public treasury.” Elliot and Dowson, ill. p. 33. 

17. “ Appears to be intended for 500 dinars, which in the then existing 
relations of the precious metals in Asia would be worth just about 100 marks 
of silver. Wassaf s price, 220 dinars of red gold, seems very inconsistent with 
this, but is not so materially, for it would appear that the dinar of red gold 
(so called) was worth two dinars.” —Yule.

year there shall not be one hundred of them remaining, for they 
all die off. And this arises from mismanagement, for those people 
do not know in the least how to treat a horse; and besides they have 
no farriers. The horse-merchants not only never bring any farriers 
with them, but also prevent any farrier from going thither, lest 
that should in any degree baulk the sale of horses, which brings 
them in every year such vast gains. They bring these horses by 
sea aboard ship . 18 

They have in this country the custom which I am going to 
relate. When a man is doomed to die for any crime, he may 
declare that he will put himself to death in 
honour of such or such an idol ; and ' the ^ 

government then grants him permission to do 
so. His kinsfolk and friends then set him upon a cart, and provide 
him with twelve knives, and proceed to conduct him all about the 
city, proclaiming aloud: “ This valiant man is going to slay him- 
self for the love of (such an idol) And when they be come to 
the place of execution he takes a knife and sticks it through his 
arm, and cries : “ I slay myself for the love of (such a god) V 9 Then 
he takes another knife and sticks it through his other arm, and 
takes a third knife and runs it into his belly, and so on until he 
kills himself outright. And when he is dead his kinsfolk take the 
body and bum it with a joyful celebration. Many of the women 
also, when their husbands die and are placed on the pile to be

The people are Idolaters, and many of them worship the ox,

these are very glad to eat beef, though they dare not kill the animal. 
Howbeit if an ox dies, naturally or otherwise, then they eat him.

And about that race of Govis, I should tell you that nothing on

of one of these Govis and to try to hold him in the

Jesus Christ lies buried, they could not do it ! Such 
is the influence of the Saint ; for it was by people of this generation

And another strange thing to be told is that there is no possibi-

trial. For even when a great blood-mare here has

breeding is nothing but a wretched wry-legged weed, not fit 

to ride. 19 


19. * The ill success in breeding horses was exaggerated to impossibility, 
and made to extend to all India,’ — Yule. Cf. Wassaf on horses in Ma’bar : 

“ It is a strange thing that when those horses arrive there, instead of giving 
them raw barley they give them roasted barley and grain dressed with butter, 
and boiled cow’s milk to drink.

They bind them for forty days in a stable with ropes and pegs, in order that they 
may get fat; and afterwards, without taking measures for training, and with- 
out stirrups and other appurtenances of riding, the Indian soldiers ride upon 
them like demons. They are equal to Burak in celerity, and are employed 
either in war or exercise. In a short time, the most strong, swift, fresh, and 
active horses become weak, slow, useless and stupid. In short they all become 
wretched and good for nothing. In this climate these powerful horses which 
% swiftly without a whip (for whips are required for horses, especially if 
they are to go any distance), should they happen to cover, become exceedingly 
weak and altogether worn out and unfit for riding. There is, therefore, a con- 
stant necessity of getting new horses annually, and, consequently, the mer- 
chants of Muhammadan countries bring them to Ma’bar.” —Elliot and Dowson,

The people of the country go to battle all naked, with only a 
lance and a shield ; and they are most wretched soldiers. They 
will kill neither beast nor bird, nor anything that hath life ; and 
for such animal food as they eat, they make the Saracens, or others 
who are not of their own religion, play the butcher. 

It is their practice that every one, male and female, do wash 
the whole body twice every day; and those who do not wash are 
looked on much as we look on the Patarins 20 (You 
must know also that in eating they use the right personal 
hand only, and would on no account touch their food habits 
with the left hand. All cleanly and becoming uses 
are ministered to by the right hand, whilst the left is reserved for 
uncleanly and disagreeable necessities, such as cleansing the secret 
parts of the body and the like. So also they drink only from drink- 
ing vessels, and every man hath his own: nor will any one drink 
from another’s vessel. And when they drink they do not put the 
vessel to the lips, but hold it aloft and let the drink spout into 
the month. No one would on any account touch the vessel with his 
mouth, nor give a stranger drink with it. But if the stranger have 
no vessel of his own they will pour the drink into his hands and he 
may thus drink from his hands as from, a cup.) 

They are very strict in executing justice upon criminals, and 
as strict in abstaining from wine. Indeed they have made a rule 
that wine-drinkers and seafaring men are never to 
be accepted as sureties. For they say that to be a justice 
seafaring man is all the same as to be an utter 
desperado, and that his testimony is good for nothing. Howbeit 
they look on lechery as no sin. 

(They have the following rule about debts. If a debtor shall 
have been several times asked by his creditor for payment, and 
shall have put him off from day to day with promises, then if the 
creditor can once meet the debtor and succeed in drawing a circle 
round him, the latter must not pass out of this circle until he shall 
have satisfied the claim, or given security for its discharge. If he 
in any other case presume to pass the circle he is punished with 
death as a transgressor against right and justice. And the said 
Messer Marco, when in this kingdom on his return home, did him- 
self witness a case of this. It was the King, who owed a foreign 
merchant a certain sum of money, and though the claim had often

been presented, he always put it off with promises. Now, one day 
when the King was riding through the city, the merchant found his 
opportunity, and drew a circle round both King and horse. The 
King, on seeing this, halted, and would ride no further; nor did he 
stir from the spot until the merchant was satisfied. And when the 
bystanders saw this they marvelled greatly, saying that the King 
was a most just King indeed, having thus submitted to justice.) 

You must know that the heat here is sometimes so great that 
’tis something wonderful. And rain falls only for three months 
in the year, viz., in June, July and August. 21 Indeed

refreshing the earth and cooling the air, the drought

They have many experts in an art which they call Physiognomy, 
by which they discern a man’s character and qualities at once. 

They also know the import of meeting with any 
astrology, particular bird or beast ; for such omens are regard- 

ed by them more than by any people in the world. 
Thus if a man is going along the road and hears some one sneeze, 
if he deems it (say) a good token for himself he goes on, but if 
otherwise he stops a bit, or peradventure turns back altogether 
from his journey. 

As soon as a child is born they write down his nativity, that 
is to say the clay and hour, the month, and the moon’s age. This 
custom they observe because every single thing they do is done with 
reference to astrology, and by advice of diviners skilled in Sorcery 
and Magic and Geomancy, and such like diabolical arts; and some 
of them are also acquainted with Astrology. 

(All parents who have male children, as soon as these have 
attained the age of 13, dismiss them from their home, and do not

boys in trade they say that the boys are then of an age to get their 
living by trade ; so off they pack them with some 
twenty or four-and-twenty groats, or at least with money equi- 
valent to that. And these urchins are running about all 
day from pillar to post, buying and selling. At the time 
of the pearl-fishery they run to the beach and purchase, from the

take these to the merchants, who are keeping indoors for fear of 
the sun, and say to them: “These cost me such a price; now give 
me what profit you please on them.” So the merchant gives some- 
thing over the cost price for their profit. They do in the same 
way with many other articles, so that they become trained to be 
very dexterous and keen traders. And every day they take their 
food to their mothers to be cooked and served, but do not eat a 
scrap at the expense of their fathers.) 

In this kingdom and all over India the birds and beasts are 
entirely different from ours, all but one bird which is exactly like 
ours, and that is the Quail. But everything else is 
totally different. For example they have bats,— I fauna 
mean those birds that fly by night and have no 
feathers of any kind ; well, their birds of this kind are as big as a 
goshawk 1 Their goshawks again are as black as crows, a good deal 
bigger than ours, and very swift and sure. 

Another strange thing is that they feed their horses with boiled 
rice and boiled meat, 22 and various other kinds of cooked food. 
That is the reason why all the horses die off. 

They have certain abbeys in which are gods and goddesses to 
whom many young girls are consecrated; their fathers and mothers 
presenting them to that idol for which they enter- 
tain the greatest devotion. And when the (monks) devabasjs 
of a convent desire to make a feast to their god, 
they send for all those consecrated damsels and make them sing 
and dance before the idol with great festivity. They also 
bring meats to feed their idol withal ; that is to say, the 
damsels prepare dishes of meat and other good things and put the 
food before the idol, and leave it there a good while, and then the 
damsels all go to their dancing and singing and festivity for about 
as long as a great Baron might require to eat his dinner. By that 
time they say the spirit of the idols has consumed the substance of 
the food, so they remove the viands to be eaten by themselves with 
great jollity. This is performed by these damsels several times 
every year until they are married. 

(The reason assigned for'' 'summoning the damsels to these 
feasts is, as the monks say, that the god is vexed and angry with 
the goddess, and will hold no communication with her; and they say 
that if peace be not established between them things will go from 
bad to worse, and they never will bestow their grace and benedic-

The men of this country have their beds made of very light 
canework, so arranged that, when they have got in and are going

there for the night. This is done to get out of the way of tarantulas 
which give terrible bites, as well as of fleas and such vermin, and 
at the same time to get as much air as possible in the great heat 
which prevails in that region. Not that everybody does this, but 
only the nobles and great folks, for the others sleep on the streets.) 

Now I have told you about this kingdom of the province of 
Maabar, and I must pass on to the other kingdoms of the same 
province, for I have much to tell of their peculiarities. 

— Op. cit. Bk. iii. chh. xvi-xvii. 

C. Of the place where lieth the body of St. Thomas the Apostle ; 
and of the miracle thereof 

The body of Messer St. Thomas the Apostle lies in this province 
of Maabar at a certain little town having no great population ; ’tis 
a place where few traders go, because there is very little merchan- 
dise to be got there, and it is a place not very accessible. Both 
Christians and Saracens, however', greatly frequent it in pilgrimage. 
For the Saracens also do hold the Saint in great reverence, and say 
that he was one of their own Saracens and a great prophet, giving 
him the title of Avarian, which is as much as to say “Holy Man.” 
The Christians who go thither in pilgrimage take of the earth from 
the place where the Saint was killed, and give a portion thereof 
to any one who is sick of a quartan or a tertian fever ; and by the 
power of God and of St. Thomas the sick man is incontinently cured. 
The earth, I should tell you, is red. A very fine miracle occurred 
there in the year of Christ, 1288, as I will now relate. 

A certain Baron of that country, having great store of a certain 
kind of corn that is called rice, had filled up with it all the houses 
that belonged to the church, and stood round about it. The Chris- 
tian people in charge of the church were much distressed by his 
having thus stuffed their houses with his rice ; the pi l gr im s too had 
nowhere to lay their heads; and they often begged the pagan Baron 
to remove his grain, but he would do nothing of the 
miracles kind. So one night the Saint himself appeared with 

a fork in his hand, which he set at the Baron's 



MARCO POLO 


173 


throat, saying : “ If thou void not my houses, that my pilgrims 
may have room, thou shalt die an evil death,” and 
therewithal the Saint pressed him so hard with the fork that he 
thought himself a dead man. And when morning came he caused 
all the houses to be voided of his rice, and told everybody what 
had befallen him at the Saint’s hands. So the Christians were 
greatly rejoiced at this grand miracle, and rendered thanks to God 
and to the blessed St. Thomas. Other great miracles do often come 
to pass there, such as the healing of those who are sick or deformed, 
or the like, especially such as be Christians. 

The Christians who have charge of the church have a great 
number of the Indian Nut trees, whereby they get their living; and 
they pay to one of those brother Kings six groats for each tree 
every month (year?). 

Now, I will tell you the manner in which the Christian breth- 
ren who keep the church relate the story of the Saint’s death . 23 

They tell that the Saint was in the wood outside his hermitage 
saying his prayers; and round about him were many peacocks, for 
these are more plentiful in that country than anywhere else. And 
one of the Idolaters of that country being of the lineage of those 
called Govi that I told you of, having gone with his bow and arrows 
to shoot peafowl, not seeing the Saint, let fly an arrow at one of 
the peacocks; and this arrow struck the holy man in the right side, 
insomuch that he died of the wound, sweetly addressing himself 
to the Creator. Before he came to that place where he thus died 
he had been in Nubia, where he converted much people to the 
faith of Jesus Christ, 

The children that' are born here are black enough, but the 
blacker they be the more they are thought of; wherefore from the 
day of their birth their parents do mb them every week with oil 
of sesame, so that they become as black as devils. Moreover, they 
make their gods black and their devils white, and the images of 
their saints they do paint black all over. 

They have such faith in the ox, and hold it for a thing so holy, 
that when they go to the wars they take of the hair of the wild-ox, 
whereof I have elsewhere spoken, and wear it tied to the necks of 

23. This is among the earliest accounts localising the martyrdom of 
St. Thomas in S. India. Note that the story of his death, a manifest fabrication 
from the name Mayilappur, has nothing in common with other stories on the 
same subject. 4 But the tradition of Thomas’s preaching in India is very old, 
so old that it probably is, in its simple form, true/ — Yule.

their horses ; or, if serving on foot, they hang this hair to their 
shields, or attach it to their own hair. And so this hair bears a high 
price, since without it nobody goes to the wars in any good heart. 
For they believe that any one who has it shall come scatheless out of 
battle. 

— Op. cit Bk. iii. ch. xviii. 

D, Concerning the Kingdom of Mutfili (Motupalli) 

When you leave Maabar and go about 1,000 miles in a northerly 
direction you come to the kingdom of Mutfili. 24 This was formerly 
under the rule of a King, and since his death, some forty years past, 
it has been under his Queen, a lady of much discretion, who for the 
great love she bore him never would marry another husband. 25 
And I can assure you that during all that space of forty years she 
had administered her realm as well as ever her husband did, or 
better ; and as she was a lover of justice, of equity, and of peace, 
she was more beloved by those of her kingdom than ever was Lady 
or Lord of theirs before. The people are Idolaters, and are 
tributary to nobody. They live on flesh, and rice, and milk. 

It is in this kingdom that diamonds are got ; and I will tell you 
how. There are certain lofty mountains in those parts; and when 
the winter rains fall, which are very heavy, the 
diamond-mines waters come roaring down the mountains in great 
torrents. When the rains are over, and the 
waters from the mountains have ceased to flow, they search 
the beds of the torrents and find plenty of diamonds. In summer 
also there are plenty to be found in the mountains, but the heat of 
the sun is so great that it is scarcely possible to go thither, nor is 
there then a drop of -water to be found. Moreover in those moun- 
tains great serpents are rife to a marvellous degree, besides other 
vermin, and this owing to the great heat. The serpents are also the 
most venomous in existence, insomuch that any one going to that 
region runs fearful peril ; for many have been destroyed by these 
evil reptiles. 

Now among these mountains there are certain great and deep 
valleys, to the bottom of which there is no access. Wherefore the

men who go in search of the diamonds take with them pieces of 
flesh, as lean as they can get, and these they cast into the bottom 
of a valley. Now there are numbers of white eagles that haunt 
those mountains ' and feed upon the serpents. When the eagles see 
the meat thrown down they pounce upon it and carry it up to some 
rocky hill-top where they begin to rend it. But there are men on 
the watch, and as soon as they see that the eagles have settled they 
raise a loud shouting to drive them away. And when the eagles 
are thus frightened away the men recover the pieces of meat, and 
find them full of diamonds which have stuck to the meat down in 
the bottom . 26 For the abundance of diamonds down there in the 
depths of the valleys is astonishing, but nobody can get down ; and 
if one could, it would be only to be incontinently devoured by the 
serpents which are so rife there. 

There is also another way of getting the diamonds. The people 
go to the nests of those white eagles, of which there are many, and 
in their droppings they find plenty of diamonds which the birds 
have swallowed in devouring the meat that was cast into the 
valleys. And, when the eagles themselves are taken, diamonds are 
found in their stomachs. 

So now I have told you three different ways in which these 
stones are found. No other country but this kingdom of Mutfili 
produces them, but there they are found both abundantly and of 
large size. Those that are brought to our part of the world are only 
the refuse, as it were, of the finer and larger stones. For the flower 
of the diamonds and other large gems, as well as the largest pearls, 
are all carried to the Great Kaan and other Kings and Princes of 
those regions ; in truth they possess all the great treasures of the 
world. 

In this kingdom also are made the best and most delicate buck- 
rams , 27 and those of highest price ; in sooth they look like tissue of 
spider’s web ! There is no King nor Queen in the 
world but might be glad to wear them . The people cotton- 
have also the largest sheep in the world, and great manufactures 
abundance of all the necessaries of life.

There is now no more to say ; so I will next tell you about a 
province called Lar from which the Abraiaman come. 

—Op. cit. Bk. iii. ch. xix. 

E. Concerning the Province of Lar whence the Brahmins come 

Lar is a province lying towards the west when you quit the 
place where the Body of St. Thomas lies ; and all the Abraiaman 
in the world come from that province . 28 

You must know that these Abraiaman are the best merchants 
in the world, and the most truthful, for they would not tell a lie 
for anything on earth. (If a foreign merchant who does not know 
the ways of the country applies to them and entrusts his goods to 
them, they will take charge of these, and sell them in the most 
loyal manner, seeking zealously the profit of the foreigner and 
asking no commission except what he pleases to bestow) . They 
eat no flesh, and drink no wine, and live a life of great chastity, 
having intercourse with no women except with their wives ; nor 
would they on any account take what belongs to another ; so their 
law commands. And they are all distinguished by wearing a 
thread of cotton over one shoulder and tied under the other arm, 
so that it crosses the breast and the back. 

They have a rich and powerful King who is eager to purchase 
precious stones and large pearls ; and he sends these Abraiaman 
merchants into the kingdom of Maabar called soli , 29 which is the 
best and noblest Province of India, and where the best pearls are 
found, to fetch him as many of these as they can get, and he pays 
them double the cost price for all. So in this way he has a vast 
treasure of such valuables. 

These Abraiaman are Idolaters ; and they pay greater heed 
to signs and omens than any people that exists. I will mention as 
an example one of their customs. To every day of the week they 
assign an augury of this sort. Suppose that there is some pur- 
chase in hand, he who proposes to buy, when he gets up in the

was the country from which the latter chiefly came, there is much probability 
in this/’ —Yule. ;

morning takes note of his own shadow in the sun, which he says 
ought to be on that day of such and such a length ; and if his 
shadow be of the proper length for the day he completes his pur- 
chase : if not, he will on no account do so, but waits till his shadow 
corresponds with that prescribed. For there is a length establish- 
ed for the shadow for every individual day of the week ; and the 
merchant will complete no business unless he finds his shadow of 
the length set down for that particular day. (Also to each day in 
the week they assign one unlucky hour, which they term 
ChoidchP For example, on Monday the hour of Half-tierce, on 
Tuesday that of Tierce, on Wednesday Nones, and so on.) 

Again, if one of them is in the house, and is meditating a pur- 
chase, should he see a tarantula (such as are very common in that 
country) on the wall, provided it advances from a 
quarter that he deems lucky, he will complete his omens 
purchase at once ; but if it comes from a 
quarter that he considers unlucky he will not do so on any 
inducement. Moreover, if in going out, he hears any one sneeze, 
if it seems to him a good omen he will go on, but if the reverse 
he will sit down on the spot where he is, so long as he thinks that 
he ought to taroy before going on again. Or, if in travelling along 
the road he sees a swallow fly by, should its direction be lucky he 
will proceed, but if not he will turn back again ; in fact they are 
worse (in these whims) than so many Patarins! 

These Abraiaman are very long-lived, owing to their extreme 
abstinence in eating. And they never allow themselves to be let 
blood in any part of the body. They have capital teeth, which 
is owing to a certain herb they chew, which greatly improves their 
appearance, and is also very good for the health. 

There is another class of people called Chughi , 31 who are in- 
deed properly Abraiaman, but they form a religious order devoted 
to the Idols. They are extremely long-lived, every 
man of them living to 150 or 200 years. They' eat yogis 
very little, but what they do eat is good ; rice and 1 
milk chiefly. And these people make use of a very strange beverage; 
for they make a potion of sulphur and quicksilver mixt together 
and this they drink twice every month. This, they say, gives them 
long life ; and it is a potion they are used to take from their child- 
hood.

There are certain members of this Order who lead the most 
ascetic life in the world, going stark naked ; and these worship the 
Ox. Most of them have a small ox of brass or pewter or gold 
which they wear tied over the forehead . 32 Moreover they take 
cowdung and bum it, and make a powder thereof ; and make an 
ointment of it, and daub themselves withal, doing this with as 
great devotion as Christians do show in using Holy Water. (Also 
if they meet any one who treats them well, they daub a little of 
this powder on the middle of his forehead) . 

They eat not from bowls or trenchers, but put their victuals 
on leaves of the Apple of Paradise and other big leaves ; these, 
however, they use dry, never green. For they say the green 
leaves have a soul in them, and so it would be a sin. And they 
would rather die than do what they deem their Law pronounces to 
be sin. If any one asks how it comes that they are not ashamed 
to go stark naked as they do, they say, “We go naked because 
naked we came into the world, and we desire to have nothing 
about us that is of this world. Moreover, we have no sin of the 
flesh to be conscious of, and therefore we are not ashamed of our 
nakedness, any more than you are to show your hand or your 
face. You who are conscious of the sins of the flesh do well to 
have shame, and to cover your nakedness.” 

They would not kill an animal on any account, not even a fly, 
or a flea, or a louse, or anything in fact that has life ; for they say 
these have all souls, and it would be sin to do so. They eat no 
vegetable in a green state, only such as are dry. And they sleep 
on the ground stark naked, without a scrap of clothing on them or 
under them, so that it is a marvel they don’t all die, in place of 
living so long as I have told you. They fast every day in the 
year, and drink nought but water. And when a novice has to be 
received among them they keep him awhile in their convent, and 
make him follow their rule of life. And then, when they desire 
to put him to the test, they send for some of those girls who are 
devoted to the Idols, and make them try the continence of the 
novice with their blandishments. If he remains indifferent they 
retain him, but if he shows any emotion they expel him from their 
society. For they say they will have no man of loose desires 
among them.

eldest of the five brother Kings 34 It is at this city that all the 
ships touch that come from the west, as from Hormos and from 
Kis and from Aden, and all Arabia, laden with horses and with 
other things for sale. And this brings a great concourse of peo- 
ple from the country round about, and so there is great business 
done in this city of Call 

The King possesses vast treasures, and wears upon his person 
great store of rich jewels. He maintains great state and adminis- 
ters his kingdom with great equity, and extends great favour to 
merchants and foreigners, so that they are very glad to visit his 
city. 

This King has some 300 wives ; for in those parts the man who 
has most wives is most thought of. 

As I told you before, there are in this great province of 
Maabar five crowned Kings, who are all own brothers born of one 
father and one mother, and this king is one of them. Their 
mother is still living. And when they disagree and go forth to 
war against one another, their mother throws herself between

them to prevent their fighting. And should they persist in desir- 
ing to fight, she will take a knife and threaten that if' they will do 
so she will cut off the paps that suckled them and rip open the 
womb that bare them, and so perish before their eyes. In this 
way hath she full many a time brought them to desist. But when 
she dies it will most assuredly happen that they will fall out and 
destroy one another. 

(All the people of this city, as well as of the rest of India, 
have a custom of perpetually keeping in the mouth a certain leaf 
called Tembul, to gratify a certain habit and desire 
betel they have, continually chewing it and spitting 

out the saliva that it excites. The Lords and 
gentlefolks and the King have these leaves prepared with 
camphor and other aromatic spices, and also mixt with 
quicklime. And this practice was said to be very good for the 
health. If any one desires to offer a gross insult to another, when 
he meets him he spits this leaf or its juice on his face. The other 
immediately runs before the King, relates the insult that has been 
offered him, and demands leave to fight the offender. The King 
supplies the arms, which are sword and target, and all the people 
flock to see, and there the two fight till one of them is killed. They 
must not use the point of the sword, for this the King forbids) . •

G. Of the Kingdom of Coilum 

When you quit Maabar and go 500 miles towards the south- 
west you come to the kingdom of Coilum. 35 The people are Ido- 
laters, but there are also some Christians and some Jews. The 
natives have a language of their own, and a King of their own, 
and are tributary to no one. 

A great deal of brazil is got here which is called brazil Coilu- 
min from the country which produces it ; ’tis of very fine quality. 36 
Good ginger also grows here, and it is known by the same name of 
Coilumin after the country. Pepper too grows in great abundance 
throughout this country, and I will tell you how. You must know 
that the pepper-trees are (not wild but) cultivated, being regu- 
larly planted and watered; and the pepper is gathered in the 
months of May, June, .and July.

They have also abundance of very fine indigo. This is made, 
of a certain herb which is gathered, and (after the roots have been 
removed) is put into great vessels upon which they 
pour water and then leave it till the whole of the indigo 
plant is decomposed. They then put this 
liquid in the sun, which is tremendously hot there , 37 so 
that it boils and coagulates, -and becomes such as we see it 
(They then divide it into pieces of four ounces each, and in that 
form if is exported to our parts ). 38 And I assure you that the 
heat of the sun is so great there that it is scarcely to be endured ; 
in fact if you put an egg into one of the rivers it will be boiled, 
before you have had time to go any distance, by the mere heat of 
the sun! 

The merchants from Manzi, and from Arabia, and from the 
Levant come thither with their ships and their merchandise and 
make great profits both by what they import and by what they 
export. 

There are in this country many and divers beasts quite differ- 
ent from those of other parts of the world. Thus there are lions 
black all over, with no mixture of any other colour ; and there are 
parrots of many sorts, for some are white as snow 
with red beak and feet, and some are red, and fauna 
some are blue, forming the most charming sight 
in the world ; there are green ones too. There are 
also some parrots of exceeding small size, beautiful creatures. 
They have also very beautiful peacocks, larger than ours, and 
different; and they have cocks and hens quite different from ours; 
and what more shall I say ? In short, everything they have is 
different from ours, and finer and better. Neither is their fruit like 
ours, nor their beasts, nor their birds ; and this difference all 
comes of the excessive heat. 

Com they have none but rice. So also their wine they make 
from (palm-) sugar ; capital drink it is, and very speedily it makes 
a man drunk. All other necessaries of man’s life they have in 
great plenty and cheapness. They have very good astrologers and 
physicians. Man and woman, they are all black, and go naked, 

37. The heat is generated by fermentation, the sun having nothing .to do 
with it.

chief features of the manufacture of indigo by fermentation . . . There is now 
no indigo made or exported at Quilon. but there is still some feeble export of 
sappanwood, ginger and pepper.” — Yule.

will tell you of another country called Comari. 

—Op. cit Bk. iii, eh. xxii. 

H. _ Of the Country called Comari 

Comari 39 is a country belonging to India, and there you can see 
something of the North Star, which we had not been able to see 
from the Lesser Java thus far. In order to see it you must go 
some 30 miles out to sea, and then you see it about a cubit above 
the water. 

This is a very wild country, and there are beasts of all kinds 
there, especially monkeys of such peculiar fashion that you would 
take them for men ! There are also gatpauls i0 in wonderful diver- 
sity, with bears, lions, and leopards, in abundance. 

— Op. cit. Bk. iii. ch. xxiii. 

I, Concerning the Kingdom of Eli 

Eli 41 is a kingdom towards the west, about 300 miles from 
Comari. The people are Idolaters and have a king, and are tri- 
butary to nobody; and have a peculiar language. We will tell 
you particulars about their manners and their products, and you 
will better understand things now because we are drawing near 
to places that are not so outlandish. 

There is no proper harbour in the country, but there are many 
great rivers with good estuaries, wide and deep. Pepper and 
ginger grow there, and other spices in quantities. The King is 
rich in treasure, but not very strong in forces. The approach to 
his kingdom however is so strong by nature that no one can attack 
him, so he is afraid of nobody. 

And you must know that if any ship enters their estuary and 
anchors there, having been bound for some other port, they seize 
her and plunder the cargo. For they say, “ You were bound for 
somewhere else, and ’tis God has sent you hither to

us, so we have a right to all your goods/ 9 And they 
think it no sin to act thus. And this naughty custom pre- 
vails all over these provinces of India, to wit, that if a ship be 
driven by stress of weather into some other port than that to which 
it was bound, it is sure to be plundered. 42 But if a ship come 
bound originally to the place they receive it with all honour and 
give it due protection. The ships of Manzi 43 and other countries 
that come hither in summer lay in their cargoes in 6 or 8 days 
and depart as fast as possible, because there is no harbour other 
than the river-mouth, a mere roadstead and sandbanks, so that it 
is perilous to tarry there. The ships of Manzi indeed are not so 
much afraid of these roadsteads as others are, because they have 
such huge wooden anchors which hold in all weather. 

There are many lions and other wild beasts here and plenty 
of game, both beast and bird.

J. Concerning the Kingdom of Melibar (Malabar) 

Melibar is a great kingdom lying towards the west. The 
people are Idolaters ; they have a language of their own, and a 
king of their own, and pay tribute to nobody. 

In this country you see more of the North Star, for it shows 
two cubits above the water. And you must know that from this 
kingdom of Melibar, and from another near it 
called Gozurat, there go forth every year more piracy 
than a hundred corsair vessels on cruize. 

These pirates take with them their wives and children, 
and stay out the whole summer. Their method is to join in fleets 
of 20 or 30 of these pirate vessels together, and then they form 
what they call a sea cordon, that is, they drop off till there is an 
interval of 5 or 6 miles between ship and ship, so that they cover 
something like an hundred miles of sea, and no merchant ship 
can escape them. For when any one corsair sights a vessel a 
signal is made by fire or smoke, and then the whole of them make 
for this, and seize the merchants and plunder them. After they 
have plundered them they let them go, saying : “ Go along with 
you and get more gain, and that mayhap will fall to us also!” But 
now the merchants are aware of this, and go so well manned and

Still mishaps do befall them at times . 44 

There is in this kingdom a great quantity of pepper, and 
ginger, and cinnamon, and turbit, and of nuts of India. They also 
manufacture very delicate and beautiful buckrams. 
products The ships that come from the east bring copper in 

ballast. They also bring hither cloths of silk and 
gold and sendels ; also gold and silver, cloves and spikenard, and 
other line spices for which there is a demand here, and exchange 
them for the products of these countries. 

Ships come hither from many quarters, but especially from 
the great province of Manzi. Coarse spices are exported hence 
both to Manzi and to the west, and that which is carried by the 
merchants to Aden goes on to Alexandria, but the ships that go in 
the latter direction are not one to ten of those that go to the east- 
ward ; a very notable fact that I have mentioned before. 

Now I have told you about the kingdom of Melibar ; we 
shall now proceed and tell you of the kingdom of Gozurat. And 
you must understand that in speaking of these kingdoms we note 
only the capitals ; there are great numbers of other cities and 
towns of which we shall say nothing, because it would make too 
long a story to speak of all.

I, Friar John of Monte Corvino, of the order of Minor Friars, 
departed from Tauris, a city of the Persians, in the year of the 
Lord 1291, and proceeded to India. And I remained in the coun- 
try of India, wherein stands the church of St. Thomas the Apostle, 
for thirteen months, and in that region baptized in different places 
about one hundred persons. The companion of my journey was 
Friar Nicholas of Pistoia, of the order of Preachers, who died 
there, and was buried in the church aforesaid.

Possibility of Conversions to Christianity in India 

I have seen the greater part of India and made inquiries about 
the rest, and can say that it would be most profitable to preach 
to them the faith of Christ, if the brethren would but come. But 
none should be sent except men of the most solid character ; for 
those regions are very attractive, abounding in aromatic spices 
and precious stones. But they possess few of our fruits, and, on 
account of the great mildness and warmth of the climate, the peo- 
ple there go naked, only covering the loins. And thus the arts 
and crafts of our tailors and cordwainers are not needed, for 
they have perpetual summer and no winter. I baptized there 
about a hundred persons.

matters just as they have been written from India by a certain 
Minorite Friar (the travelling companion of Brother Nicholas of

and spoken with, and it was in his arms that the said Brother 
Nicholas did die. The letter was to the effect following : 

“ The state of things (with regard to climate) in the Indies is 
such as shall now be related. 

“ In India it is always warm, and there never is any winter ; 
yet the heat is not extravagant. And the reason is, that there be 
at all times winds which temper the heat of 
climate the air. And the reason why there can be 

no winter is the position of the country 
with respect to the zodiac, as I shall now tell. This is to say, the 
sun when entering Virgo, i.e., on the 24th day of August, sends 
down his rays, as I have seen and in particular noted with my own 
eyes, quite perpendicularly, so as to cast no shadow on either side. 
And in like manner when he is entering Aries, i.e., at the end of 
March. And when he has gone through Aries he passes towards 

the north, and casts shadows towards the south until. (the 

summer solstice) and then turns to Virgo, and after he has past 
through the sign of Virgo he then casts his shadow towards the 
north. And thus there is never so great an elongation of the sun 
as to admit of cold, and there are not two seasons. Or, as I have 
said before, there is no winter or cold season. 

“ As regards the length of the day and the night I have tried 
to determine them by such measures and indications as I could. 
I have observed that at the two epochs before mentioned, when 
the sun’s rays strike perpendicularly without casting any shadow, 
the day is fifteen hours long, and the night nine. And when the 
sun is at the solstice of Cancer, the day is a little less than four- 
teen hours long, and the night is a little more than ten, perhaps by 
a quarter of an hour. But when the sun is in the solstice of 
Capricorn , that is to say in the month of December, the day 
has a length of eleven hours and the night of thirteen. For the 
sun’s elongation is somewhat greater when it is in Capricorn than 
when it is in Cancer. 2 * 

“Moreover, the star which we call the Pole-star is there so de- 
pressed, i.e., so low, that it can scarcely be seen. And methought 
that if I had been on a lofty point I could have seen the other Pole- 
star which is in the opposite quarter. I looked many a time for a 
sight of it, and I saw several constellations which moved round 
about it, from observing which I gathered that they were exceed-

ingly near to it. But because of the continual haze on the horizon 
in that quarter, caused by the heat and the winds, and because of 
the stars being so low, I never could satisfy myself. However India 
is a very extensive region, and perhaps in some places it would 
be seen at a greater elevation, in others at a less. I have examined 
the matter to the best of my ability. So much as to (the climate 
of) Upper India, which is called maebar, in the territory of St. 
Thomas. 

“ Concerning the state of things as to the country 
itself in Upper India . — The condition of the country of 
India aforesaid is this. The land is well enough peo- 
pled ; and there be great cities therein, but the houses are wretched, 
being built of sandy mud, and usually thatched with leaves of trees. 
Hills there are few; rivers in some places are many, in others few. 
Springs there are few or none; wells in plenty; and the reason is 
this, that water is generally to be found at the depth of two or 
three paces, or even less. This well water is indeed not very good 
to drink, for it is somewhat soft and loosens the bowels; so they 
generally have tanks or excavations like ponds, in which they col- 
lect the rain water, and this they drink. They keep few beasts. 
Horses there are none, except it be in possession of the king and 
great barons. Flies there be few, and fleas none at all . 3 And they 
have trees which produce fruit continually, so that on them you find 
fruit in every stage up to perfect ripeness at one time. In like 
manner they sow and reap at almost all seasons, and this because 
it is always warm and never cold. Aromatic spices are to be had 
good cheap, some more so and some less so, according fo what spices 
they be. They have trees that produce sugar, and others that pro- 
duce honey, and others that produce a liquor that has 
a smack of wine. And this the natives of those pepper 
countries use for drink. And those three things plant 
are to be had at very small cost. And the pepper 
plant is here also. It is slender and knotty like a vine ; and indeed 
’tis altogether very like a vine, excepting that it is more slender, 
and bears transplanting. 

“ Ginger is a reed-like plant, and, like a cane-root, it can be 
dug and transplanted. But their canes here are 
more like trees, being sometimes a cubit in girth

“ The Brazil tree is a slender, lofty and thorny tree, all red as 
It were, with leaves like fern. The Indian nuts

“ The cinnamon tree is of a medium bulk, not very high, and

cinnamon indeed, altogether it resembleth the laurel 

greatly in appearance. Great store of it is

“ The state of things as regards the inhabitants of India is as 
follows : — The men of this region are idolaters, without moral law, 
or letters, or books. They have indeed an 
people alphabet which they use to keep their accounts, 

and to write prayers or charms for their 
idols ; albeit they have no paper, but write upon leaves of trees like 
unto palm leaves. They have no conscience of sin whatever. They 
have idol-houses in which they worship at almost all hours of the 
day ; for they never join together in worship at any fixed hour, but 
each goes to worship when it pleases himself. And so they worship 
their idols in any part of these temples, either by day or by night. 
They frequently set forth their fasts and feasts, but they have no 
fixed recurring day to keep, either weekly or monthly. Their mar- 
riages take place only at one time of the year ; and when the hus- 
band dies the wife cannot marry again. The sin of the flesh they 
count not to be sin, nor are they ashamed to say so.

are a very few Christians, and Jews, and they are of little weight. 
The people persecute much the Christians, and all who bear the 
Christian name. 

44 They bury not their dead but burn them, carrying them to the 
pile with music and singing ; whilst apart from this occasion ' the 
relatives of the deceased manifest great grief and affliction like 
other folk. 

44 But India is a region of great extent, and it hath many realms 
and many languages. And the men thereof are civil and friendly 
enough, but of few words, and remind me some- 
what of our peasants. They are not, strictly dress 
speaking, black, but of an olive colour, and 
exceedingly well formed both women and men. They go barefoot 
and naked, except that they wear a cloth round the loins, and boys 
and girls up to eight years of age wear nothing whatever, but go 
naked as they came from their mother’s womb. They shave not the 
beard ; many times a day they wash ; bread and wine they have 
none. Of the fruits that we make use of they have few or none ; 
but for their daily food they use rice and a little milk ; and they eat 
grossly like pigs, to wit, with the whole hand or fist, and without a 
spoon. In fact, when at their food they do look more like pigs than 
men ! 

44 There is great security in the country. Bandits and robbers 
are seldom met with ; but they have many exactions to pay. There 
are few craftsmen, for craft and craftsmen have little remuneration, 
and there is little room for them. They commonly use swords and 
daggers like ourselves ; and if actually they have a battle they make 
short work of it, however great the forces be, for they go to battle 
naked, with nothing but sword and dagger. They have among them 
a few Saracen mercenaries, who carry bows. 

44 The state of things in regard to the Sea of India is this. The 
sea aboundeth greatly with fish ; and in some parts of it they fish 
for pearls and precious stones. The havens 
are few and bad ; and you must know that the sea 
the sea here is the Middle Sea or Ocean, Tra- 
versing it towards the south there is no continent found but islands 
alone, but in that sea the islands are many, more than 12,000 in 
number. And many of these are inhabited and many are not. 

44 You can sail (upon that sea) between these islands and 
Ormes and (from Ormes) to those parts which are called 
(Minibar) is a distance of 2,000 miles in a direction between south

and south-east ; then 300 miles between east and south-east from 
Minibar to Maabar, which (latter however) you enter steering to 
the north ; and from Menabar (Maabar ?) you sail another 300 
miles between north-east and north to Siu Simmoncota . 6 The 
rest I have not seen, and therefore I say nothing of it. 

“ The shores of the said sea in some places run out in shoals for 
100 miles or more, so that ships are in danger of grounding. And 
they cannot make the voyage but once a 
navigation year, for from the beginning of April till the end 
of October the winds are westerly, so that no 
one can sail towards the west ; and again ’tis just the contrary from 
the month of October till March. From the middle of May till the 
end of October the wind blows so hard that ships which by that 
time have not reached the ports whither they are bound, run a des- 
perate risk, and if they escape it is great luck. And thus in the past 
year there perished more than sixty ships ; and this year seven ships 
in places in our own immediate neighbourhood, whilst of what has 
happened elsewhere we have no intelligence. Their ships in these 
parts are mighty frail and uncouth, with no iron in them, and no 
caulking. They are sewn like clothes with twine. And so if the 
twine breaks anywhere there is a breach indeed ! Once every year 
therefore there is a mending of this, more or less, if they propose to 
go to sea. And they have a frail and flimsy rudder like the top of 
a table, of a cubit in width, in the middle of the stern ; and when 
they have to tack, it is done with a vast deal of trouble ; and if it is 
blowing in any way hard, they cannot tack at all. They have but 
one sail and one mast, and the sails are either of matting or of 
some miserable cloth. The ropes are of husk. 

6. The first section of the voyage, then, I understand to be from the Per- 
sian Gulf to one of the ports of Malabar (called Minabar) ; the second from 
the said port to some city on the Gulf of Manaar; and the third from the Gulf 
of Manaar to some place on the Coromandel coast, at least as far north as the 
Church of St. Thomas, i.e., Madras. I say “some city on the Gulf of Manaar’* 
because we shall see presently that Mabar is, with the present writer, a city, 
and is probably to be identified with that where Marco Polo locates his chief 
king of Mabar. As Polo seems to specify this as sixty miles west of Ceylon, 
I judge that it must have been somewhere near Ramnad. It is not Cail, be- 
cause he says distinctly that Cail was subject to another of the chiefs, and Cail 
is a good deal more than sixty miles from any part of Ceylon. 

The extreme point which our author visited, whether Siu Simmoncota or 
Giu Gimmoncota (for it is so read by Kunstmann), I cannot determine. It 
must have been at least as far up the coast as Madras, because he tells us in 
the first letter that his companion Nicholas of Pistoia was buried in the church 
of St. Thomas.— Yule.

This was a great place in days of old, for it was the city of King 
Porus, who waged so great a battle with King Alexander. 4 The 
people thereof are idolaters, for they worship fire, and serpents, and 
trees also. The land is under the dominion of the Saracens, who 
have taken it by force of arms, and they are now subject to the 
Empire of Dili. 5 

Here be found sundry kinds of beasts and especially black 
lions 6 in very great numbers, besides monkeys and baboons, and 
bats as big as pigeons are here. There be also rats as big as here 
are our dogs called Scherpi . And for this reason rats 7 are there 
caught by dogs, for the mousers or cats are of no use for that. In 
this country every man hath before his house a plant of twigs as 
thick as a pillar would be here, and this never withers as long as 
it gets water. 8 9 And many other strange things are there which it 
would be pretty to hear tell.

(B) Of the kingdom of Minibar and how pepper is got 

And now that ye may know how pepper is got, let me tell you 
that it groweth in a certain empire whereunto I came to land, the 
name whereof is Minibar, 10 and it groweth nowhere else in the world 
but there. And the forest in which the pepper groweth extendeth 
for a good eighteen days’ journey, and in that forest there be two 
cities, the one whereof is called Flandrina and the other 
Cyngilin. 11 In the city of Flandrina some of the inhabitants are 
Jews and some are Christians ; and between those two cities there 
is always internal war, but the result is always that the Christians 
beat and overcome the Jews,'; ; y 

Now, in this country they get the pepper in this manner. First, 
then, it groweth on plants which have leaves like ivy, and these are 
planted against tall trees as our vines are here, and bear fruit just 
like bunches of grapes ; and this fruit is borne in such quantities 
that they seem like to break under it. And when the fruit is ripe 
it is of a green colour, and ’tis gathered just as grapes are gathered 
at the vintage, and then put in the sun to dry. And when it is dried 
it is stored in jars [and of the fresh pepper also they make a con-' 
fection, of which I had to eat, and plenty of it]. And in this forest 
also there be rivers in which be many evil crocodiles, Le., serpents. 
[And there be many other kinds of serpents in the forest, which the

numbers, and a variety of beasts which are not found in our Frank 
countries. And here they burn the brazil-wood for fuel, and in the 
woods are numbers of wild peacocks. 12 ] 

At the extremity of that forest, towards the south, there is a 
certain city which is called Polumbum, in which is grown better 
ginger than anywhere else In the world. And the variety and abun- 
dance of wares for sale in that city is so great that it would seem 
past belief to many folk. 

—Op. cit. pp. 132-137. 

(C) Of the manners of the idolaters of 
Polumbum (Quilon) 

[Here all the people go naked, only they wear a cloth just 
enough to cover their nakedness, which they tie behind.] All the 
people of this country worship the ox for their god [and they eat not 
his flesh]; for they say that he is, as it were, a sacred creature. 
Six years they make him to work for them, and the seventh year 
they give him rest from all labour, and turn him out in some 
appointed public place, declaring him thenceforward to be a con- 
secrated animal. And they observe the following abominable super- 
stition. Every morning they take two basins of gold or silver, and 
when the ox is brought from the stall they put these under him and 
catch his urine in one and his dung in the other. With the former 
they wash their faces, and with the latter they daub themselves, 
first on the middle of the forehead ; secondly, on the balls of both 
cheeks ; and, lastly, in the middle of the chest. And when they have 
thus anointed themselves in four places they consider themselves 
to be sanctified [for the day] . Thus do the common people ; and 
thus do the king and queen likewise. 

They worship also another idol, which is half man and half ox. 
And this idol giveth responses out of its mouth, and oft-times 
demandeth the blood of forty virgins to be given to it. For men 
and women there vow their sons and their daughters to that idol, 
just as here they vow to place them in some religious order. And 
in this manner many perish. 


12. * Marignolli has a mild sneer directed probably at Odoric’s talk about 
the pepper ‘forest’; apparently the latter did not stay any time in Malabar, 
and he probably derived his information from harbour gossip.’ —Yule.

And many other things are done by that people which it would 
be abomination even to write or to hear of, and many other things 
be there produced and grown, which it booteth little to relate. But 
the idolaters of this realm have one detestable custom [that I must 
mention] . For when any man dies, they bum him, and if he leave 
a wife they burn her alive with him, saying that she ought to go and 
keep her husband company in the other world. But if the woman 
have sons by her husband she may abide with them, as she will. 
And, on the other hand, ' if the wife die there is no law to impose 
the like on him ; but he, if he likes, can take another wife. It is also 
customary there for the women to drink wine and not the men. The 
women also have their foreheads shaven, whilst the men shave not 
the beard. And there be many other marvellous and beastly cus- 
toms which ’tis just as well not to write.

(D) Concerning the kingdom of Mobar , where lieth the body 
of St. Thomas, and the customs of the idolaters. 

From this realm 13 ’tis a journey of ten days to another realm 
which is called Mobar, 14 and this is very great, and hath under 
it many cities and towns. And in this realm is laid the body of the 
Blessed Thomas the Apostle. 15 His church is filled with 
idols 16 , and beside it are some fifteen houses of the Nesto- 
rians, that is to say Christians, but vile and pestilent here- 
tics. There is likewise in this kingdom a certain wonderful idol, 
which all the provinces of India greatly revere. It is as Mg as 
St. Christopher is commonly represented by the painters, and it is 
entirely of gold, seated on a great throne, which is also of gold. And 
round its neck it hath a collar of gems of immense value. And the 
church of this idol is also of pure gold, roof (and walls) and pave- 
ment. People come to say their prayers to the idol from great dis- 
tances, just as Christian folk go from far on pilgrimage to St. Peter’s. 
And the manner of those who come is thus : — Some travel with a 
halter round their necks ; and some with their hands upon a board, 
which is tied to their necks ; others with a knife stuck in the arm,

which they never remove until they arrive before the idol, so that 
the arm is then all in a slough. And some have quite a different 
way of doing'. For these as they start from their houses take three 
steps, and at the fourth they make a prostration at full length upon 
the ground. And then they take a thurible and incense the whole 
length of that prostration. And thus they do continually until they 
reach the idol, so that sometimes when they go through this operation 
it taketh a very great while before they do reach the idol. But when 
those who are going along in this way wish to turn aside to do any- 
thing, they make a mark there to show how far they have gone, and 
so they [come back upon this, and] continue until they reach the 
idol. 

And hard by the church of this idol there is a lake, made by 
hand, into which the pilgrims who come thither cast gold or silver 
or precious stones, in honour of the idol, and towards the mainte- 
nance of the church, so that much gold and silver and many preci- 
ous stones have been accumulated therein. And thus when it is 
desired to do any work upon the church, they make search in the 
lake and find all that hath been cast into it . 17 

But annually on the recurrence of the day when that idol was 
made, the folk of the country come and take it down, and put it on 
a fine chariot ; and then the king and queen and all the pilgrims, 
and the whole body of the people join together and draw it forth 
from the church with loud singing of songs and all kinds of music ; 
and many maidens go before it by two and two chaunting in a mar- 
vellous manner. And many pilgrims who have come to this feast 
cast themselves under the chariot, so that its 
* car festival wheels may go over them, saying that they 
desire to die for their God. And the car passes 
over them, and crushes and cuts them in sunder, and so they 
perish on the spot. And after this fashion they drag the idol to a 
certain customary place, and then they drag him back to where he 
was formerly, with singing and playing as before. And thus not 
a year passes but there perish more than five hundred men in this 
manner; and their bodies they burn, declaring that they are 
holy, having thus devoted themselves to death for their God . 18 


17. The Masalcik-el-Absar corroborates this story and says that Mahomed 
Tughlak (a few years after Odorie’s visit) captured the city and caused the

And another custom they have of this kind. One will come 
saying : “ I desire to sacrifice myself for my God ? ” And then his 
friends and kinsfolk, and all the players of the country, assemble 
together to make a feast for him who is determined to die for his 
God. And they hang round his neck five very sharp knives, and 
lead him thus to the presence of the idol with loud songs. Then 
he takes one of those sharp knives and calls out with a loud voice : 
“ Thus I cut my flesh for my God ” ; and cutting a piece of his flesh 
wherever he may choose, he casteth it in the face of the idol ; and 
saying again : “ I devote myself to die for my God,” he endeth by 
slaying himself there. And straightway they take his body and 
burn it, for they look on him as a saint, having thus slain himself 
for his idol. And many other things greatly to be marvelled at are 
done by these people, which are by no means to be written. 

But the king of this island 19 or province is passing rich in gold

A. Scope for conversions in India 

Let me tell you that the fame of us Latins is more highly 
thought of among the people of India than among us Latins our- 
selves. Nay they are in continual expectation of the arrival of the 
Latins here, which they say is clearly predicted in their books. 1 
And moreover, they are continually praying the Lord, after their 
manner, to hasten this wished-for arrival of the Latins. If our lord 
the Pope would but establish a couple of galleys on this sea, what 
a gain it would be ! And what damage and destruction to the Soldan 
of Alexandria ! O, who will tell this to his holiness the Pope ? 
For me, wayfarer that I am, his out of the question. Rut I commit 
all to you, holy fathers. Fare ye well, then, holy fathers, and re- 
member the pilgrim in your prayers. Pray for the pilgrim of Christ, 
all of you, that the Indian converts, black as they are, may all be 
made white in soul before the good Jesus, through his pitiful grace. 
I end my words with many a sigh, most heartily recommending my- 
self to the prayers of all.

B. Concerning India the Less 2 

In the entrance to India the Less are (date) palms, giving a 
great quantity of the sweetest fruit ; but further on in India they 
are not found. 4

prophecies ; the Mexicans had similar tales also. —Yule. 

2. For details see Odoric in Cathay , ii. pp. 117-132 “The date (Jan. 1323) 
must mean, I think, our Jan. 1324.”— Yule. 

3. It may he gathered from what follows, that Lesser India embraces 
Sindh, and probably Mekran, and India along the coast as far as some point 
immediately north of Malabar. Greater India extends from Malabar very in- 
definitely to the eastward, for he makes it include Champa (Cambodia) . India 
Tertia is the east of Africa. —Yule. 

4. X believe this is substantially correct. Sindh is the only province in 
India that produces edible dates. A date-palm is found all over India, but 
the fruit is worthless. —Yule. 



JORDANUS m 

In this lesser India are many things worthy to be noted with 
wonder ; for there are no springs, no rivers, no ponds ; nor does it 
ever rain, except during three months, viz., between the middle of 
May and the middle of August ; and (wonderful!) notwithstanding 
this, the soil is most kindly and fertile, and during the nine months 
of the year in which it does not rain, so much dew is found every 
day upon the ground that it is not dried up by the sun’s rays till 
the middle of the third hour of the day. 

Here be many and boundless marvels ; and in this first India 
beginneth, as it were, another world; for the men and women be all 
black, and they have for covering nothing but a strip of cotton tied 
round the loins, and the end of it flung over the naked neck. 
Wheaten bread is there not eaten by the natives, although wheat 
they have in plenty; but rice is eaten with its seasoning, only boiled 
in water. And they have milk and butter and oil, which they often 
eat uncooked. In this India there be no horses, nor mules, nor 
camels, nor elephants ; but only kine, with which they do all their 
doings that they have to do, whether it be riding, or carrying, or 
field labour. The asses are few in number and very small, and 
not much worth . 5 

The days and nights do not vary there more than by two hours 
at the most. 

There be always fruits and flowers there, divers trees, and 
fruits of divers kinds ; for (example) there are some 
trees which bear very big fruit, called Chaqui ; JACK FRUIT 
and the fruit is of such size that one is enough for five persons . 6 

There is another tree which has fruit like that just named, 
and it is called Bloqui, quite as big and as sweet, but not of the 
same species. These fruits never grow upon the twigs, for these 
are not able to bear their weight, but only from the main bran- 
ches, and even from the trunk of the tree itself, down to the very 
roots. 


5. He is wrong about the non-existence of horses and camels in what he 
calls, India the Less. — Yale..:-,; 

, 6. The . name jack, which we give to the tree and its fruits, is one of that 
large class of words which are neither English nor Hindustani, but Anglo- 
Indian, and the origin of which is often very difficult to trace. Drury gives 
pilavoo as the Malayalam name, but I find that Kheede (Hortus Malabaricus, 
vol. iii) '"gives .also Tsjaka ; and Linschoten, too, says that the jack is in Malabar 
called laca : ■ so here we have doubtless the original. —Yule. Rheede’s tsjaka 
is clearly Mai. Cakka.

There is another tree which has fruit like a plum, but a very 
big one, which is called Aniba. This is a fruit so sweet and delici- 
ous as it is impossible to utter in words . 7 

There be many other fruit trees of divers kinds, which it would 
be tedious to describe in detail. 

I will only say this much, that this India, as regards fruit and 
other things, is entirely different from Christendom ; except, in- 
deed, that there be lemons there, in some places, as sweet as sugar, 
whilst there be other lemons sour like ours. There be also pome- 
granates, but very poor and small. There be but few vines, and 
they make from them no wine, but eat the fresh grapes ; albeit 
there are a number of other trees whose sap they collect, and it 
standeth in place of wine to them. 

First of these is a certain tree called Nargil ; which tree every 
month in the year sends out a beautiful frond like (that of) a 
(elate) palm-tree, which frond or branch produces very large fruit, 
as big as a man’s head. There often grow on 
cocoanut one such stem thirty of those fruits as big as I 

have said. And both flowers and fruits are pro- 
duced at the same time beginning with the first month and 
going up gradually to the twelfth ; so that there are flowers and 
fruit in eleven stages of growth to be seen together. A wonder! 
and a thing which cannot be well understood without being witness- 
ed. From these branches and fruits is drawn a very sweet water. 
The kernel (at first) is very tender and pleasant to eat ; afterwards 
it waxeth harder, and a milk is drawn from it as good as milk of 
almonds ; and when the kernel waxeth harder still, an oil is made 
from it of great medicinal virtue. And if any one careth not to 
have fruit, when the fruit-bearing stem is one or two months old he 
maketh a cut in it, and bindeth a pot to this incision ; and so the 
sap, which would have been converted into fruit, drops in ; and it is 
white like milk, and sweet like must, and maketh drunk like wine,

is the meaning of that word I believe in Arabic. Our author’s just description 
of the flavour of the mango is applicable, however, only to finer stocks, and 
seems to show that the “Bombay mango” already existed in the thirteenth 
century. The mango is commonly believed in Anglo-India to produce boils, 
which I see was also the belief in Linschoten’s day. But I agree with his 
commentator, that, at the time when the fruit is ripe, “by reason of the great 
heate and season of the yeare— many doe fall into the fore-named diseases, 
although they eate none of this fruite” —Yule.

so that the natives do drink it for wine ; and those who wish not to 
drink it so, boil it down to one-third of its bulk, and then it be- 
cometh thick, like honey; and ’tis sweet, and fit for making pre- 
serves, like honey and the honeycomb. One branch gives one 
potful in the day and one in the night, on the average throughout 
the year ; thus five or six pots may be found hung upon the same 
tree at once. With the leaves of this tree they cover their houses 
during the rainy season. The fruit is that which we call nuts of 
India ; and from the rind of that fruit is made the twine 8 with which 
they stitch their boats together in those parts. 

There is another tree of a different species, which like that 
gives all the year round a white liquor pleasant to drink, which 
tree is called Tari . 9 Thei*e is also another, 
called Belluri , 10 giving a liquor of the same palmyra 
kind, but better. There be also many other 
trees, and wonderful ones ; among which is one which sendeth 
forth roots from high up , 11 which gradually grow down to the 
ground and enter it, and then wax into tranks like the main trunk, 
forming as it were an arch ; and by this kind of multiplication one 
tree will have at once as many as twenty or thirty trunks beside 
one another, and all connected together. ’Tis marvellous ! And 
truly this which I have seen with mine eyes, ’tis hard to utter with 
my tongue. The fruit of this tree is not useful, but poisonous and 
deadly. There is (also) a tree harder than all, which the strongest 
arrows can scarcely pierce. 

The trees in this India, and also in India the Greater, never 
shed their leaves till the new ones come. 

To write about the other trees would be too long a business ; 
and tedious beyond measure ; seeing that they are many and 
divers, and beyond the comprehension of man. 

But about wild beasts of the forest I say this : there be lions, 
leopards, ounces, and another kind something like a greyhound, 
having only the ears black and the whole body 
perfectly white, which among those people is called wild animals 
Siagois . 12 This animal, whatever it catches, never

lets go, even to death. There is also another animal, which is called 
Rhinoceros , as big as a horse, having one horn long and twisted; but 
it is not the unicorn. 

There be also venomous animals, such as many serpents, big 
beyond bounds, and of divers colours, black, red, white, and green, 
and parti-coloured : two-headed also, three-headed, and five-head- 
ed. Admirable marvels ! 1S 

There be also coquodriles, which are vulgarly called Calcatix ; 
some of them be so big that they be bigger than the biggest horse. 
These animals be like lizards, and have a tail stretched over all, 
like unto a lizard’s ; and have a head like unto a swine’s, and rows 
of teeth so powerful and horrible that no animal can escape their 
force, particularly in the water. This animal has, as it were, a coat 
of mail ; and there is no sword, nor lance, nor arrow, which can 
anyhow hurt him, on account of the hardness of his scales. In the 
water, in short, there is nothing so strong, nothing so evil, as this 
wonderful animal. There be also many other reptiles, whose 
names, to speak plainly, I know not. 

As for birds, I say plainly that they are of quite different kinds 
from what are found on this side of the world ; except, indeed, 
crows and sp arrows ; for there be parrots and 
birds popinjays in very great numbers, so that a 

thousand or more may be seen in a flock. 
These birds, when tamed and kept in cages, speak so that you 
would take them for rational beings. There be also bats really and 
truly as big as kites. These birds fly nowhither by day, but only 
when the sun sets. Wonderful ! By day they hang themselves up 
on trees by the feet, with their bodies downwards, and in the day- 
time they look just like big fruit on the tree. 

There are also other birds, such as peacocks, quails, Indian 
fowls, and others, divers in kind; some white as white can be, some 
green as green can be, some parti-coloured, of such beauty as is 
past telling. 

In this India, when men go to the wars, and when they act as 
guards to their lords, they go naked, with a round target, — a frail 
and paltry affair, — and holding a kind of spit in their hands ; and, 
truly, their fighting seems like child’s play.

In this India are many and divers precious stones, among 
which are the best diamonds under heaven. These 
stones never can be dressed or shaped by any art, precious 
except what nature has given. But I omit the pro- stones 
perties of these stones, not to be prolix. 

In this India are many other precious stones, endowed with 
excellent virtues, which may be gathered by anybody ; nor is any- 
one hindered. 

In this India, on the death of a noble, or of any people of sub- 
stance, their bodies are burned : and eke their wives follow them 
alive to the fire, and, for the sake of worldly glory, 
and for the love of their husbands, and for eternal sati 
life, bum along with them, with as much joy as if 
they were going to be wedded ; and those who do this have the 
higher repute for virtue and perfection among the rest. Wonderful! 

I have sometimes seen, for one dead man who was burnt, five living 
women take their places on the fire with him, and die with their 
dead. 

There be also other pagan-folk in this India who worship fire ; 
they bury not their dead, neither do they burn them, but cast them 
into the midst of a certain roofless tower, and there 
expose them totally uncovered to the fowls of parsis 
heaven. These believe in two First Principles, to 
wit, of Evil and of Good, of Darkness and of Light, matters which at 
present I do not purpose to discuss . 14 

There be also certain others which be called Dumbri , 15 who 
eat carrion and carcases ; who have absolutely no object of wor- 
ship ; and who have to do the drudgeries of other people, and carry 
loads.

The heat there is perfectly horrible, and more intolerable to 
strangers than it is possible to say. 

In this India there exists not, nor is found, any metal but what 
comes from abroad, except gold, iron, and electrum. There is no 
pepper there, nor any kind of spice except ginger. 

In this India the greater part of the people worship idols, 
although a great share of the sovereignty is in the hands of the 
Turkish Saracens, who came forth from Multan, 
religions and conquered and usurped dominion to themselves 

not long since, and destroyed an infinity of idol 
temples, and likewise many churches, of which they made mosques 
for Mahomet, taking possession of their endowments and property. 
J Tis grief to hear, and woe to see ! 

The Pagans of this India have prophecies of their own that we 
Latins are to subjugate the whole world. 

In this India there is a scattered people, one here, another 
there who call themselves Christians, but are not so, nor have they 
baptism, nor do they know anything else about the faith. Nay, 
they believe St. Thomas the Great to be Christ ! 

There, in India I speak of, I baptised and brought into the 
faith about three hundred souls, of whom many were idolaters and 
Saracens. 

And let me tell you that among the idolaters a man may with 
safety expound the Word of the Lord ; nor is any one from among 
the idolaters hindered from being baptized throughout all the East, 
whether they be Tartars, or Indians, or what not. 

These idolaters sacrifice to their gods in this manner ; to wit, 
there is one man who is priest to the idol, and he wears a long shirt, 
down to the ground almost, and above this a white surplice in our 
fashion; and he has a clerk with a shirt who goes after him, and 
carries a hassock, which he sets before the priest. And upon this 
the priest kneels, and so begins to advance from a distance, like one 
performing his stations ; and he carries upon his bent arms a tray of 
two cubits (long), all full of eatables of different sorts, with lighted 
tapers at top ; and thus praying he comes up to the altar where the

idol is, and deposits the offering before it after their manner; 
and he pours a libation, and places part (of the offering) in the 
hands of the idol, and then divides the residue, and himself eats a 
part of it. 

They make idols after the likeness of almost all living things 
of the idolaters; and they have besides their god according to his 
likeness. It is true that over all gods they place One God, the 
Almighty Creator of all those. They hold also that the world has 
existed now xxviii thousand years. 16 

The Indians, both of this India and of the other Indies, never 
kill an ox, but rather honour him like a father ; and some, even 
perhaps the majority, worship him. They will more readily spare 
him who has slain live men than him who has slain one ox, saying 
that it is no more lawful to kill an ox than to kill one’s father. This 
is because oxen do all their services, and moreover furnish them 
with milk and butter, and all sorts of good things. The great lords 
among the idolaters, every morning when they rise, and before 
they go anywhither, make the fattest cows come before them, and 
lay their hands upon them, and then rub their own faces, believing 
that after this they can have no ailment. 

Let this be enough about Lesser India ; for were I to set forth 
particulars of everything down to worms and the like, a year would 
not suffice for the description. 

But (I may say in conclusion) as for the women and men, the 
blacker they be, the more beautiful they be (held) .

C. Concerning India the Greater 

Of India the Greater I say this; that it is like unto Lesser India 
as regards all the folk being black. The animals also are all simi- 
lar, neither more nor less (in number), except elephants, which 
they have (in the former) in very great plenty. These animals 
are marvellous ; for they exceed in size and bulk and strength, and 
also in understanding, all the animals of the world. This animal 
hath a big head ; small eyes, smaller than a horse’s ; ears like the 
wings of owls or bats ; a nose reaching quite to the ground, ex- 
tending right down from the top of his head ; and two tusks stand- 


'X6. ; : This does not agree in any way with any version of the Hindu 'mythi- 
cal chronology that I know of, —Yule,

ing out of remarkable magnitude (both in) bulk and length, which 
are (in fact) teeth rooted in the upper jaw. This 
trained animal doth everything by word of command ; so 

elephants that his driver hath nothing to do but say once, “ Do 

this,” and he doeth it; nor doth he seem in 
other respects a brute, but rather a rational creature. They have 
very big feet, with six hoofs like those of an ox, or rather of a 
camel. This animal carrieth easily upon him, with a certain struc- 
ture of timber, more than thirty men; and he is a most gentle 
beast, and trained for war, so that a single animal counteth by 
himself equal in war to 1,500 men and more ; for they bind to his 
tusks blades or maces of iron wherewith he smiteth. Most horri- 
ble are the powers of this beast, and specially in war. 

Two things there be which cannot be withstood by arms ; one 
is the bolt of heaven ; the second is a stone from an artillery 
engine ; this is a third ! For there is nothing that either can or 
dare stand against the assault of an elephant in any manner. A 
marvellous thing ! He kneeieth, lieth, sitteth, goeth, and cometh, 
merely at his master’s word. In short, it is impossible to write in 
words the peculiarities of this animal. 

In this India there are pepper and ginger, cinnamon, brazil, 17 
and all other spices. 

Ginger is the root of a plant which hath leaves like a reed. 
Pepper is the fruit of a plant something like ivy, which climbs 
trees, and forms grape-like fruit like that of the wild vine. This 
fruit is at first green, then when it comes to maturity it becomes all 
black and corrugated as you see it. ’Tis thus that long pepper is 
produced, nor are you to believe that fire is placed under the 
pepper, nor that it is roasted, as some will lyingly maintain. 18 


17. Brazil. This is the sappan-wood, affording a red dye, from a species 
of caesalpina found in nearly all tropical Asia, from Malabar eastward. The 
name of brazil wood is now appropriated to that (derived from another species 
of caesalpina) which comes from Brazil, and which, according to Macculloch, 
gives twice as much dye from the same weight of wood. The history of the 
names here is worthy of note. First, brazil is the name of the Indian wood in 
commerce. Then the great country is called Brazil, because a somewhat simi- 
lar wood is found abundantly there. And now the Indian wood is robbed of 
its name, which is appropriated to that found in a country of the New World, 
and is supposed popularly to be derived from the name of that country. I do 
not know the origin of the word brazil. Sappan is from the Malay name 
sapang . — Yule.

his amanuensis or copyist; for long pepper is the produce of a different

Cinnamon is the bark of a large tree which has fruit and flowers 
like cloves. 

In this India be many islands, and more than 10,000 of them 
inhabited, as I have heard; wherein are many world’s wonders. 
For there is one called Silem, where are found the best precious 
stones in the whole world, and in the greatest quantity and num- 
ber, and of all kinds. 

Between that island and the main are taken pearls or mar- 
guerites, in such quantity as to be quite wonderful. So indeed 
that there are sometimes more than 8,000 boats or vessels, for three 
months continuously, (engaged in this fishery). It is astounding, 
and almost incredible, to those who have not seen it, how many are 
taken. 

Of birds I say this : that there be many different from those 
of Lesser India, and of different colours ; for there be some white 
all over as snow ; some red as scarlet of the grain ; 
some green as grass ; some parti-coloured ; in parrots 
such quantity and delectability as cannot be 
uttered. Parrots also, or popinjays, after their kind, of every 
possible colour except black, for black ones are never found ; 
but white all over, and green, and red, and also of mixed colours. 
The birds of this India seem really like creatures of Paradise. 

There is also told a marvellous thing of the islands aforesaid, 
to wit that there is one of them in which there is a water, and a 
certain tree in the middle of it. Every metal which is washed with 
that water becomes gold ; every wound on which are placed the 
bruised leaves of that tree is incontinently healed. 

genus (Chavica ) , which is not a vine, but a shrub, whose stems are annual. 
The chemical composition and properties are nearly the same as those of black 
pepper. Crawfurd draws attention to the fact that, by Pliny’s account, piper 
longum bore between three and four times the price of black pepper in the 
Roman market (Drury in voc. — Crawford's Diet.). Though long pepper is 
now cultivated in Malabar, it was not so, or at least not exported , in the 
sixteenth century. Linschoien says expressly that the “long pepper groweth 
onely in Bengala and Java.” (p. Ill) , Its price at Rome was probably therefore 
a fancy one, due to its rarity. It is curious that Pliny supposed pepper to grow 
in pods, and that the long pepper was the immature pod picked and prepared 
for the market. He corrects a popular error that ginger was the root of the 
pepper tree (Bk. xii), Ibn Battuta, like our Bishop, contradicts what “some 
have -said, that they boil it in order to dry it,” as without foundation. But 
■their predecessor, E. Benjamin, says— “ the pepper is' originally white,., but 
when they collect it, they put it in basins and pour hot water upon it; it is 
then exposed to the heat of the sun,” etc.— Yule.

In the aforesaid island of Sylen is a very potent king, who 
hath precious stones of every kind under heaven, in such quantity 
as to be almost incredible. Among these he hath two rubies, of 
which he weareth one hung round his neck, and the other on the 
hand wherewith he wipeth his lips and his beard ; and (each) is of 
greater length than the breadth of four fingers, and when held in 
the hand it standeth out visibly on either side to the breadth of 
a finger. I do not believe that the universal world hath two stones 
like these, or of so great a price, of the same species . 22 

There is also another island where all the men and women go 
absolutely naked, and have in place of money comminuted gold

In this India never do (even) the legitimate sons of great 
kings, or princes, or barons, inherit the goods of their parents, but 
only the sons of their sisters ; for they say that they have no surety 
that those are their own sons, because wives and mistresses may 
conceive and generate by some one else ; but ’tis not so with the 
sister, for whatever man may be the father they are certain that the 
offspring is from the womb of their sister, and is consequently thus 
truly of their blood. 

In this Greater India many sacrifice themselves to idols in 
this way. When they are sick, or involved in any grave mis- 
chance, they vow themselves to the idol if they 
should happen to be delivered. Then, when they self- 
have recovered, they fatten themselves for one or immolation 
two years continually, eating and drinking fat 
things, etc. .And when another festival comes round, they cover 
themselves with flowers and perfumes, and' crown themselves with 
white garlands, and go with singing and playing before the idol 
when it is carried through the land (like the image of the Virgin 
Mary here among us at the Rogation tides) ; and those men who 
are sacrificing themselves to the idol carry a sword with two 
handles, like those (knives) which are used in currying leather; 
and, after they have shown off a great deal, they put the sword to 
the back of the neck, cutting strongly with a vigorous exertion of 
both hands, and so cut off their own heads before the idol 26

trumeth about, the female entereth the second gate, which is in-

(A) South India 

A traveller states the following : Div is an island which faces 
Kanbalt (Cambay) from the southern side. Its inhabitants prac- 
tise piracy and live in reed huts. Their drink is rain water. 

A traveller says that the country which extends from Sinda- 
pur to Hannaur (Honavar) towards the east leads to Malabar. 
Hannaur is a pretty little town with numerous orchards. All 
Malabar is covered with forest and with trees entangling one 
another, thanks to the abundance of water. From Hannaur one 
goes to Basarour (Barcelore) , a small place ; beyond it, one comes 
to Manjarur (Mangalore) , one of the largest towns of Malabar. 
Its king is an infidel. Manjarur is to the East of the localities 
already mentioned. After a three days’ journey from Manjarur, 
one comes across a big mountain which projects into the sea and is 
seen by sailors from a distance ; it is called Ra’s Haili (promon- 
tory of Illy) . At the extremity of Malabar we have Tandiyur, a 
small place to the east of Ra’s Halli, and there we find many 
gardens. The other localities of Malabar are Schaliyat (Jaliat) 
and SchinkilL One of these places is inhabited by Jews, but the 
narrator has omitted to note which. 3 Kaulam is the last town of 
Malabar, the pepper country. 

The first locality in the Coromandel from the side of Malabar 
is Ra’s Komhori (Cape Comorin) , mountain and town. Another 
town of Coromandel, Manifattan, is situated on the coast. The 
capital of Coromandel is Biyyardawal. It is the residence of the 
Sultan of Coromandel Horses are brought to him from other 
countries.

The Coromandel, says Ibn Sa’id, is celebrated by the reports 
of travellers. It is from there that they export a muslin which has 
passed into proverb for its fineness. To the north lie the moun- 
tains adjacent to the country of Balhara, who is one of the kings 
of India ; to the west the river of Suliyan falls in the sea. The 
Coromandel is three or four days’ journey to the East of Caoulem. 
I should add that this ought to be with an inclination towards the 
south.

At the extremity of the Pepper country (Malabar) . 

Caoulem, says Ibn Sa’id, is the last town in the Pepper country 
towards the east. One sets sail from this town in order to go to 
Aden. A traveller has told me that Caoulem is a town situated on 
a gulf at the very end of the Pepper country and that it includes a 
quarter for the Mussulmans and a Mosque. The town is built on 
a Sandy Plain. The orchards there are always numerous. One 
notices the boqqam tree (brazil) which looks like a pomegranate 
and whose leaf is like that of a Jujube tree.

(A) On the rebellion of Baha-ud-din Gushtdsp 

On the rebellion of the son of the Sultan's paternal aunt and 
what relates to it : 

The Sultan Tughlaq had a nephew (son of his sister) called 
Baha-ud-din Gushtasp (Hystaspe), who was appointed gover- 
nor of a province. When his uncle died, he refused to take the 
oath of allegiance to his son ; he was a brave soldier, a hero. The 
king sent against him an army commanded by powerful amirs 
like Malik Majir and the Vazir KHwajah Jahan who was comman- 
der-in-chief. The cavalry on both sides were engaged, and the 
combat was fierce, both the armies exhibiting great courage. In 
the end the Sultan's troops prevailed, and Baha-ud-din fled to one 
of the Hindu kings named the Rai Kanbilah (raid or raja) . The 
term 4 rai 5 among these people, as among Christians, 1 means 4 king. 5 
As for Kanbilah, it is the name of the country where the 4 raja 5 
lived. This prince possessed territories situated on inaccessible 
mountains, and he was one of the principal Sultans of the infidels. 

When Baha-ud-din fled to this king, he was pursued by the sol- 
diers of the monarch of India who beset these countries. The infidel 
prince, perceiving the danger to which he was exposed as his 
stores of grain became exhausted and fearing that 
siege op they might capture him by force, told Baha-ud-din : 

kampila “ You see in what condition we are ; I have 

decided to perish with my family and all those 
who wish to follow me. Go to the Sultan so and so (he mentioned 
the name of a Hindu prince) and stay with him, he will protect 
you.” He sent some one with him to conduct him there ; then he 
ordered a great fire to be prepared, and this was done. Then he 
burnt his effects, and said to his wives and daughters : “ I intend 
to die, and those of you who wish to do as I do, may do so. 55 Then 
each one of his wives bathed, anointed herself with sandal named 
muqasari , kissed the earth before the rai of Kanbilah and cast her- 
self on the pyre ; they all perished. The wives of the amirs, vazirs, 
and nobles of his state followed them ; other women besides did

who wished to die with him followed his example in every respect. 
They went out to fight with the troops of the Sultan and fought 
till all of them met their death. The town was 
invaded, and its inhabitants were taken captive, fall of 
and eleven sons of the rai of Kanbilah thus cap- kampila 
tured were sent to the Sultan, and they were 
made Mussulmans. The sovereign made them amirs and honoured 
them greatly as much for their illustrious birth as in consideration 
of the conduct of their father. I saw in the Sultan’s palace, among 
these brothers, Nasr, Bakhtiyar and Almuhardar , £ the Guardian 
of the Seal.’ He keeps the ring with which is sealed the water 
(doubtless Ganges water) which the monarch is to drink ; his sur- 
name is Abu Muslim, and we were comrades and friends. 

After the death of the rai of Kanbilah, the troops of the Sultan 
marched to the infidel country where Baha-ud-dln had taken re- 
fuge, and surrounded it. This prince said : “ I can not do like rai 
Kanbilah ” . He caught hold of Baha-ud-dln and 
delivered him to the army of the Emperor of India . capture of 
They fettered his legs, tied his hands to his neck and gushtasf 
conducted him thus before the Sultan. The 
Sultan ordered him to be taken before his wives and female rela- 
tions ; they insulted him and spat upon him. Then he ordered 
him to be flayed alive,: after he had been skinned, his flesh was 
cooked with rice and some of it was sent to his wife and children, 
They put the remnants on a large plate and gave them to the 
elephants which declined to eat them. The Sultan ordered the 
skin to be stuffed with straw, and paraded in all the provinces to- 
gether with the stuffed figure of Bahadur Burah.

(B) Rebellion in Ma/bar 

The rebellion of Sharif Jalal-ud-dm in the province of Ma’bar,

revolt: 

The Sultan had appointed the Sharif Jalal-ud-dm Ahasan Shah 
governor of the country of Ma’bar (the passage, the South-east of 
the peninsula), which is at a distance of six months’ march from 
Delhi. Jalal-ud-dm rebelled, usurped the power, killed the lieute- 
nants and agents of the sovereign, and struck coins of gold and 
silver in his own name. On one side of the dinars he had the 
following words engraved : * the offspring of Ta-ha and Ya-sin

world and of religion and on the other face : ‘He who puts his 
trust in the help of the Merciful ; Ahasan Shah Sultan.’ 

Hearing of this revolt, the emperor set out to suppress it. He 
camped in a place called Kushak-i-Zar meaning ‘ castle of gold and 
he spent eight days there attending to the needs of the people. It 
was then that they brought to him the nephew of the vazlr KHwajah 
Jahan, as also three or four amirs — all with fetters on their feet and 
their hands tied to their necks. The Sultan had sent this vazlr 
with the advance guard ; and he had arrived at the town of Zhar 
(Dhar) ; which was at a distance of twenty-four days’ march from 
Delhi ; and where he stopped some time. The son of his sister was 
an intrepid fellow, a brave warrior ; he plotted with three other 
chiefs, who were caught at the same time as himself, to kill his 
uncle and flee to the rebel Sharif in the province of Ma’bar, carry- 
ing with them all the treasures and provisions. They had decided 
to attack the vazir at the moment when he came out to go for the 
Friday prayer ; but one person who was in the know of their 
plans denounced them. He was called Malik Nusrat, the 
chamberlain ; and he told the vazlr that the proof of their project 
would he found in their wearing cuirasses under their robes. The 
vazir had them produced before him and found them in the condi- 
tion stated ; he sent them to the Sultan. 

I was with the emperor, when these conspirators arrived ; one 

of them was tall and bearded, but he trembled and read the chap- 

ter Ya-sin of the Quran (xxxvi, the prayer of the dying). 
In accordance with the Sultan’s order, the amirs in question were 

thrown to the elephants which are trained to kill men, and the son 

of the vazir’s sister was sent to his uncle that he might kill him ; 

and he did so.

Of the rebellion of the Sultan's lieutenant in 
the country of Tiling : 

When the Sultan returned from Tiling, he left behind Taj- 
uJ-Mulk Nusrat KHan, an old courtier, as his lieutenant in this 
country. Hearing the (false) news of the death of the sovereign, 
he had his obsequies celebrated, usurped the power and received 
oaths of allegiance from the people in his capital, Badrakot. 13 
When the Sultan came to know of these things, he sent his 
preceptor, Qutlu KHan, at the head of a numerous army. 
A terrible combat ensued in which whole multitudes 
perished ; finally Qutlu KHan invested his adversary in the 
capital ; Badrakdt was fortified ; but the siege did much 
damage to its inhabitants, and Qutlu KHan began to open a breach. 
Then Nusrat KHan surrendered himself with a safe conduct into the 
hands of the enemy commandant who assured him of his life and 
sent him to the Sultan. He also pardoned the citizens and the troops.

(C) i. Summary of Ihn Battuta's travel in S. India : Yule . 

From kanatjj Ibn Battuta and his companions turned south- 
wards to the fortress of gwalior, which Ibn Battuta had 
visited previously, and had then taken occasion to describe with 
fair accuracy. At parwan, a place which they passed through 
on leaving Gwalior, and which was much harassed by lions (pro- 
bably tigers rather), the traveller heard that certain malignant 
Jogis were in the habit of assuming the form of those animals by 
night. This gives him an opportunity of speaking of others of the 
Jogi class who used to allow themselves to be buried for months, 
or even for a. twelvemonth together, and afterwards revived. At 
Mangalore he afterwards made acquaintance with a Mussulman 
who had acquired this art from the Jogis. The route continued 
through Bundelkhand and Malwa to the city of daxjlatarab, with 


la. Telugu — Bedadakot, Bidar.

its celebrated fortress of dwaxgir (Deogiri) , and thence down the 
Valley of the Tapti to kinbaiat (Cambay) . 

From Cambay they went to Kawe , a place on a tidal gulf be- 
longing to the Pagan Raja Jaiansi, and thence to kandahar, a 
considerable city on another estuary, and belonging to the same 
prince, who professed loyalty to Delhi, and treated them hospita- 
bly. Here they took ship, three vessels being provided for them. 
After two days they stopped to water at the Isle of bairam, four 
miles from the main. This island had been formerly peopled, but 
'it remained abandoned by the natives since its capture by the 
Mahomedans, though one of the king’s officers had made an 
attempt to resettle it, putting in a small garrison and mounting 
mangonels for its defence. Next day they were at kukah, a 
great city with extensive bazaars, anchoring four miles from the 
shore on account of the vast recession of the tide. This city be- 
longed to another pagan king, Dunkul, not too loyal to the Sultan. 
Three days’ sail from this brought the party abreast of the Island 
of sindabur, but they passed on and anchored under a smaller 
island near the mainland, in which there was a temple, a grove, 
and a piece of water. Landing here, the traveller had a curious 
adventure with a Jogi, whom he found by the wall of the temple. 
Next day they came to hunawur (or Onore), a city governed 
by a Mahomedan prince with great power at sea ; apparently a 
pirate, like his successors in later times, but an enlightened ruler, 
for Ibn Battuta found in his city twenty-three schools for boys and 
thirteen for girls, the latter a thing which he had seen nowhere 
else in his travels. 

After visiting several of the northern ports of Malabar, then 
very numerous and flourishing, they arrived at calicut, which 
the traveller describes as one of the finest ports in the world, fre- 
quented for trade by the people of China, the Archipelago, Ceylon, 
the Maldives, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf. Here they were 
honourably received by the king, who bore the title of samarx 
(the Zamorin of the Portuguese) , and made their landing in great 
state. But all this was to be followed by speedy grief, as the tra- 
veller himself observes. 

At Calicut they abode for three months, awaiting the season 
for the voyage to China, viz., the spring. All the communication 
with that country, according to Ibn Battuta (the fact itself is per- 
haps questionable), was conducted in Chinese vessels, of which 
there were three classes : the biggest called junk, the middle- 
sized zao, and the third kakam. The greater ships had from 



IBN BATTUTA : YULE 


2iL 


three to twelve sails, made of strips of bamboo woven like mats. 
Each of them had a crew of 1000 men, viz., 600 sailors and 400 
soldiers, and had three tenders attached, which were called res- 
pectively the half, the third, and the quarter, names appa- 
rently indicating their proportionate size. The vessels for this 
trade were built nowhere except at zaxtun and sinkalan, the 
city also called sin-tjl-sxn, and were all made with triple sides, 
fastened with enormous spikes, three cubits in length. Each 
ship had four decks, and numerous private and public cabins for 
the merchant passengers, with closets and all sorts of conveniences. 
The sailors frequently had pot-herbs, ginger, etc., growing on 
board in wooden tubs. The commander of the ship was a very 
great personage, and, when he landed, the soldiers belonging to 
his ship marched before him with sword and spear and martial 
music. 

The oars or sweeps used on these great junks were more like 
masts than oars, and each was pulled by from ten to thirty men. 
They stood to their work in two ranks, facing each other, pulling 
by means of a strong cable fastened to the oar (which itself was, 
I suppose, too great for their grasp) , and singing out to the stroke, 
La, La! La, La! 

The only ports of Malabar frequented for trade by the China 
vessels were Kaulam, Calicut, and Hill ; but those which intended 
to pass the Monsoon in India, used to go into the harbour of 
fandaraina for that purpose. Thirteen of these ships, of dif- 
ferent sizes, were lying at Calicut when Ibn Battuta’s party were 
there. 

The Zamorin prepared accommodation on board one of the 
junks for the party from Delhi ; but Ibn Battuta, having ladies with 
him, went to the agent for the vessel, a Mahomedan called Sulei- 
man ul-Safadi-ul-Shami, to obtain a private cabin for them, having, 
it would seem, in his usual happy-go-lucky way, deferred this to 
the last moment. The agent told him that the cabins were all 
taken up by the Chinese merchants, who had (apparently) u return 
tickets.” There was one, indeed, belonging to his own son-in-law, 
which Ibn Battuta could have, but it was not fitted up ; however 
if he took that now, probably he would be able to make some bet- 
ter arrangement on the voyage; (it would seem from this that 
shipping agency in those days was a good deal like what it some- 
times is now). So one Thursday afternoon our traveller’s bag- 
gage and slaves, male and female, were put on board, whilst he 
stayed ashore to attend the Friday service before embarking. His 



222 


FOREIGN NOTICES 


colleagues, with the presents for China, were already on board. 
But the next morning early, the Eunuch Hilal, Ibn Battutas 
servant, came to complain that the cabin assigned to them was a 
wretched little hole, and would never do. Appeal was made to 
the captain, but he said it could not be helped; if, however, they 
liked to go in a kakam which was there, they might pick and 
choose. Our traveller consented, and had his goods and his wo- 
men-kind transferred to the kakam before public prayer time. In 
the afternoon the sea rose (it always did in the afternoon, he 
observes), and it was impossible to embark. By this time the 
China ships were ail gone except that with the presents, another 
junk which was going to 'stop over the monsoon at Fandaraina, 
and the kakam, on which all the moor’s property was embarked. 
When he got up on Saturday morning the junk with his colleagues, 
and the kakam, had weighed, and got outside the harbour. The 
junk bound for Fandaraina was wrecked inside. There was a 
young girl on board, much beloved by her master, a certain mer- 
chant. He offered ten pieces of gold to any one who would save 
her. One of the sailors from Hormuz did save her, at the immi- 
nent risk of his life, and then refused the reward. “I did it for 
the love of God,” said this good man. The junk with the presents 
also was wrecked on the reefs outside, and all on board perished. 
Many bodies were cast up by the waves ; among others those of 
the Envoy Zahir-uddin, with the skull fractured, and of Malik 
Sunbul the eunuch, with a nail through his temples. Among the 
rest of the people who flocked to the shore to see what was going 
on, there came down the Zamorin himself, with nothing on but a 
scrap of a turban and a white cotton Dhoti, attended by a boy 
with an umbrella. And, to crown all, when the kakam’s people 
saw what had befallen their consort, they made all sail to seaward, 
carrying off with them our traveller’s slaves, his girls and gear, and 
leaving him there on the beach of Calicut gazing after them, with 
nought remaining to him but his prayer-carpet, ten pieces of gold, 
and an emancipated slave, which last absconded forthwith! 

He was told that the kakam must touch at Kaulam, so he de- 
termined to go thither. It was a ten days’ journey, whether by 
land or water, so he set off by the lagoons with a Mussulman whom 
he had hired to attend on him, but who got continually drunk, and 
only added to the depression of the traveller’s spirits. On the 
tenth day he reached Kaulam, the Columbum of our friars, which 
he describes as one of the finest cities of Malabar, with splendid 
bazaars, and wealthy merchants, there termed Suli , some of 
whom were Mahomedans. There was also a Mahomedan Kazi 



IBN BATTUTA : YULE 


223 


and Shabandar (Master Attendant), etc. Kaulam was the first 
port at which the China ships touched on reaching India, and 
most of the Chinese merchants frequented it. The king was an 
Infidel, called tirawari, a man of awful justice, of which a 
startling instance is cited by Ibn Battuta. One day when the 
king was riding with his son-in-law, the latter picked up a mango, 
which had fallen over a garden wall. The king’s eye was upon 
him; he was immediately ordered to be ripped open and divided 
asunder, the parts being exposed on each side of the way, and a 
half of the fatal mango beside each! 

The unfortunate ambassador could hear nothing of his 
kakam, but he fell in with the Chinese envoys who had been 
wrecked in another junk. They were refitted by their country- 
men at Kaulam, and got off to China, where Ibn Battuta after- 
wards encountered them. 

He had sore misgivings about returning to tell his tale at 
Delhi, feeling strong suspicion that Sultan Mahomed would be 
only too glad to have such a crow to pluck with him. So he 
decided on going to his friend the Sultan Jamal-ud-din at Huna- 
wur, and to stop with him till he could hear some news of the 
missing kakam. The prince received him, but evidently with no 
hearty welcome. For the traveller tells that he had no servant 
allowed him, and spent nearly all his time in the mosque— -always 
a sign that things were going badly with Ibn Battuta — where he 
read the whole Koran through daily, and by and by twice a day. 
So he passed his time for three months. 

The Kihg of Hunawur was projecting an expedition against 
the Island of Sindabur. Ibn Battuta thought of joining it, and on 
taking the sortes koranicae he turned up xxii, 41, c< Surely 
God will succour those who succour Him;” which so pleased the 
king that he determined to accompany the expedition also. Some 
three months after the capture of Sindabur the restless man start- 
ed again on his travels, going down the coast to Calicut. Here 
he fell in with two of his missing slaves, who told him that his 
favourite girl was dead ; that the King of Java (probably Sumatra) 
had appropriated the other women, and that the rest of the party ' 
were dispersed, some in Java, some in China, some in Bengal. So 
there was an end of the kakam. 

He went back to Hunawur and Sindabur, where the Mussul- 
man forces were speedily beleaguered by the Hindu prince whom 
they had expelled. Things beginning to look bad, Ibn Battuta, after 
some two months’ stay, made his escape and got back to Calicut. 



224

Here he took it into his head to visit the dhibat-ul-mahal or 
Maidive (Male diva) Islands, of which he had heard wonderful 
stories. 

One of the marvels of these islands was that they were under 
a female sovereign, Kadi j a, daughter of the late Sultan Jalal-ud-din 
Omar, who had been set up as queen on the deposition of her 
brother for misconduct. Her husband, the preacher Jamal-ud-din, 
actually governed, but all orders were issued in the name of the 
princess, and she was prayed for by name in the Friday Service. 

Ibn Battuta was welcomed to the islands, and was appointed 
Kazi, marrying the daughter of one of the Wazirs and three wives 
besides. The lax devotion of the people and the primitive costume 
of the women affected his pious heart ; he tried hard but in vain to 
reform the latter, and to introduce the system that he had witness- 
ed at Urghanj, of driving folk to mosque on Friday with the con- 
stable’s staff. 

Before long he was deep in discontent, quarrels and intrigues, 
and in August 1344 he left the Maldives for Ceylon. 

As he approached the island he speaks of seeing the Mountain 
of Serendib (compare Marignolli’s mons seyllani) rising high 
in air “like a column of smoke.” He landed at Batthalah (pat- 
lam), where he found a Pagan chief reigning, a piratical poten- 
tate called Airi Shakarwati, who treated him civilly and facilitated 
his making the journey to Adam’s Peak, whilst his skipper oblig- 
ingly promised to wait for him. 

In his journey he passes manar mandali, and the port of 
salawat, and then crosses extensive plains abounding in ele- 
phants. These however did no harm to pilgrims and foreigners, 
owing to the benignant influence exercised over them by the Shaikh 
Abu Abdallah, who first opened the road to the Holy Footmark. 
He then reached kunakar as he calls it, the residence of the 
lawful King of Ceylon, who was entitled Kunar, and possessed a 
white elephant. Close to this city was the pool called the Pool of 
Precious Stones, out of which some of the most valuable gems 
were extracted. His description of the ascent to the summit is 
vivid and minute, and probably most of the sites which he speaks 
of could be identified by the aid of those who act as guides to 
Mahomedan pilgrims, if such there still be. He descends on the 
opposite side (towards Ratnapura) , and proceeds to visit din- 
war, a large place on the sea, inhabited by merchants (Devi- 
neuera or Dondera), where a vast idol temple then existed,

galle (which he calls kali), and columbo (kalanbu) , 

so returning by the coast to Patlam. Columbo is described as 
even then one of the finest cities of the island. It was the abode 
of the “Wazir and Admiral Jalasti," who kept about him a body 
of 500 Abyssinians. This personage is not impossibly the same 
with the Khwaja Jahan, who so politely robbed John Marignolli. 
It is not said whose Wazir and Admiral he was. 

. At Patlam he took ship again for Maabar, but as he approach- 
ed his. destination he again came to grief, the ship grounding some 
six or eight miles from the shore. The crew abandoned the wreck, 
but our hero stuck by it, and was saved by some pagan natives. 

On reaching the land, he reported his arrival to the de facto 
ruler of the country. This was the Sultan Ghaisuddin of Damghan, 
recently invested with the government of Maabar, a principality 
originally set up by his father-in-law, the Sheriff Jalal-uddin. The 
latter had been appointed by Mahomed Tughlak to the military 
command of the province, but about 1338-9 had declared himself 
independent, striking coin in his own name, and proclaiming him- 
self under the title of Ahhsan Shah Sultan. Ibn Battuta, during 
his stay at Delhi, had married one of the Sheriff's daughters, 
named Hhurnasab. “ She was a pious woman," says her husband, 
“ who used to spend the .night in watching and prayer. She could 
read, but had not learned to write. She bore me a daughter, but 
what is becoming of either the one or the other is more than I can 
tell! ’’ Thus Ibn Battuta was brother-in-law to the reigning Sultan, 
who, on receiving the traveller's message, sent for him to his camp, 
two days’ journey distant. This brother-in-law was a ruffian, whose 
cruel massacres of women and children excited the traveller’s 
disgust and tacit remonstrance. However, he busied himself in 
engaging the Sultan in a scheme for the invasion of the Maldives, 
but before it came to anything the chief died of a pestilence. His 
nephew and successor, Sultan Nasir-uddin, was ready to take up 
the project, but Ibn Battuta got a fever at the capital, muttra 
(Madura) , and hurried off to fatan, a large and fine city on 
the sea, with an admirable harbour, where he found ships sailing 
for Yemen, and took his passage in one of them as far as Kaulam. 
Here he stayed for three months, and then went off for the fourth 
time to visit his friend the Sultan of Hunawur. On his way, 
however, off a small island between Fakanur and Hunawur 
(probably the Pigeon Island of modern maps), the vessel was 
attacked by pirates of the wrong kind, and the unlucky adven- 
turer was deposited on the beach stript of everything but his

drawers! On this occasion, as he mentions elsewhere incidentally, 
he lost a number of transcripts of epitaphs of celebrated persons 
which he had made at Bokhara, along with other matters, not im- 
probably including the notes of his earlier travels. Returning to 
Calicut he was clothed by the charity of the Faithful. Here also 
he heard news of the Maldives; the Preacher Jamal-uddin was dead, 
and the Queen had married another of the Wazirs ; moreover one 
of the wives whom he had abandoned had borne him a son. He 
had some hesitation about returning to the Islands, as he well 
might, considering what he had been plotting against them, but en- 
couraged by a new cast of the Sortes he went and was civilly 
received. His expectations, however, or his caprices, were dis- 
appointed, for he seems to have stayed but five days, and then 
went on to Bengal.

(C) ii. — Ibn Battuta : Travels in S. India 

From Ujjain we went to Daulatabad, a large and illustrious 
city which rivals the capital, Delhi, in importance and in the 
vastness of its lay-out. It is divided into three 
daulatabad parts. One is Daulatabad, properly so called, 
reserved for the residence of the Sultan and his 
troops; the second part is called Katkah (Skt. Kataka , camp), and 
the third is the citadel, unequalled for its strength, and called Davai- 
quir (Devagir). 

At Daulatabad resides the great KHan, Qutlu KHan, preceptor 
to the Sultan. He is the commandant of the city, and represents the 
Sultan there as well as in the lands of Saghar, Tiling and their 
dependencies. The territory of these provinces extends for three 
months’ march, and is well populated. It is entirely under the 
authority of Qutlu KHan and his lieutenants. The fortress of 
Devagir above mentioned is a rock situated in the midst of a plain; 
the rock has been scarped and a castle built on its summit; it is 
reached by a leather ladder which is raised at night. 

There live with their children the Mufnd , that is to say the 
Zimamy (soldiers entered in the army lists) . In its dungeons are 
imprisoned persons convicted of serious crimes. 
dungeons In these dungeons there are huge rats, bigger than 

cats ; in truth cats run away from them as they are 
unable to resist their attacks. Hence they can be caught only by 
recourse to ruses. I saw these rats at Devagir and marvelled at 



1BN BATTUTA 


227 

The Malik KHattab, the Afghan, related to me that he was at 
one time imprisoned in a dungeon in this fortress, called the dun- 
geon of rats. £ These animals/ he said, 4 gathered near me by night to 
devour me. I defended myself against them, not without experi- 
encing fatigue. I then saw some one in a dream who said to me : 
“ Read the chapter on true piety (eh. 112 of the Quran) a hundred 
thousand times, and God will deliver you. 5 ' 1 recited this chapter 
(continued KHattab) , and when I had completed the required 
number of times, I was released. The cause of my release was 
this : Malik Mai was imprisoned in a chamber near mine ; he fell 
ill, the rats ate his fingers and his eyes, and he died. When the 
Sultan heard of this, he said : “ Release KHattab lest he should 
come to the same end.” ’ 

It was to the fortress of Devagir that Masir-ud-dln, son of the 
same Malik Mai, and Qazii Jalal-ud-dln fled for refuge, when they 
were defeated by the Sultan. 

The inhabitants of the territory of Daulatabad belong to the 
tribe of Mahrathas, to whose women God has granted a peculiar 
beauty, especially in their noses and eyebrows. 

They possess talents not found in other women, people 
in the art of pleasing men, and they know 
everything connected with the union of "the sexes. The 
idolaters of Daulatabad are devoted to commerce, and their princi- 
pal trade consists in pearls ; their wealth is enormous, and they 
are called Saha (Skt. Sarthavaha) ; the singular of the word is sah 
— and they resemble the Alcarims of Egypt. 

There are in Daulatabad vines and pomegranates which yield 
two harvests in a year. By its population and the extent of its 
territory, and the number of very large and important cities in it, 
this province is very important for the revenues derived from it. 
I was told that a certain Hindu took a lease of 
the contributions from the province for seventeen economic 
crores. The province extends, as stated above, condition 
for a distance of three months* march. A crore 
is a hundred lakhs, and a lakh is a hundred thousand dinars. But 
the Hindu did not keep his engagements ; a balance remained to 
his charge ; his treasures were seized, and he was himself flayed. 

In Daulatabad there is a bazaar for singers and singing girls. 
This bazaar, called Tarb dbcld (abode of rejoicing) is among the 
largest and most beautiful in existence. It contains many shops, 
each with a door leading to the house of its proprietor, which has

another gate independent of this. The shop is 
bazaar OF beautified with carpets, and in the midst of it, 

singers there is a sort of a large swing on which the singing 

girl sits or reclines. She is adorned with all 
kinds of jewels, and her attendants rock her swing. In the centre 
of the bazaar, there is a large pavilion, furnished with carpets, and 
gilded, where the chief musician goes and sits on all Thursdays, 
after the prayer at four in the evening, with his servants and 
slaves in front of him. The singing girls come in groups, and sing 
and dance in his presence till sunset when he withdraws. 

In this bazaar there are mosques for prayer, where the priests 
recite the prayer called tarawih in the month of Ramzan. One of 
the Hindu rulers, whenever he passed through this bazaar, used to 
alight in this pavilion, and the singing girls used to sing in his 
presence. One of the Muhammadan Sultans used to do likewise. 

We proceeded from this place to the small town of Nazarbar 
inhabited by Mahrathas, well-skilled in the mechanical arts. Their 
physicians, astrologers and nobles are called Brahmins and 
Ksatriyas. Their food consists of rice, vegetables 
nazarbar and oil of sesame for they dislike giving pain to 

animals or slaughtering them ; they wash them- 
selves before eating, as we do (at home) to get rid of a 
pollution. They do not marry among their relatives at least upto 
the seventh remove. Neither do they drink wine, for this in their 
eyes is the greatest of vices ; it is so in all India even among the 
Mussulmans ; any one of them (Muslims) that drinks wine is 
punished with eighty stripes and imprisoned for three months in a 
dungeon which is opened only at meal-times. 

From Nazarbar we went to Saghar, a large city on a considera- 
ble river of the same name . 2 On the banks of this river, we see 
water wheels , 3 and orchards where grow mangoes, 
saghar bananas and sugar-cane. The inhabitants of the 

city are peaceable, religious and upright men, and 
all their acts are worthy of approbation. There are 
orchards, with hermitages meant for travellers. Some man 
founds an hermitage, bequeaths an orchard to it, and vests the 
supervision of it in his children ; when the succession fails, the 
supervision passes to the magistrates. The population of Saghar 
is very large; strangers go there for the company of the people, 
and because the town is exempt from taxes and dues.

From Saghar we travelled to Kinbayah (Cambay), situated 
on an arm of the sea resembling a river. It is navigable for ships 
and the ebb and flow of the tide are felt in it. I 
saw ships lying in the mud during the ebb floating cambay 
on water at the flow . Kinbayah is among the most 
beautiful cities by the elegance of its construction and the 
size of its mosques. This is due to the majority of its 
inhabitants being foreign merchants who are always building fine 
houses and superb temples, and vie with one another in doing so. 

Among the large mansions of the place was that of Sharlf-ul- 
Samarry with whom I had the adventure of the pastry cakes. 4 I have 
never seen more solid woodwork than 1 saw in his house; its door 
was like the gate of a town, and quite close to a large mosque also 
bearing the name Samarry. Then there is the re- 
sidence of the Malik-ul-Tujar 5 6 ul-Kazaruni which mansions 
has also a mosque quite close, and the 
house of the trader Shams-ud-dln Kulah Duz. The last two words 
signify * cap-maker ’ in Persian. When Qazi Jalal, the Afghan, re- 
belled, as stated already, this Shams-ud-dm just mentioned, the 
captain of the ship Elias, one of the principal residents of Kinbayah, 
and the chief of the medical men who has been spoken of above, 
wished to hold this city against the rebel. They attempted to dig a 
moat round it, as it had no walls. But Jalal defeated them and 
entered the town. These three persons hid themselves in a house, 
and were afraid of being discovered. Hence they agreed to com- 
mit suicide, each of them striking another with a qattdrah . G Two 
died accordingly, but the chief of the medical men survived. 

Among the principal merchants of Kinbayah, there was again 
Najm-ud-dm of Jilan endowed with a fine figure and enormous 
riches. He built a large house and a mosque in 
this city. Later, the Sultan sent for him, made him merchants 
governor of Kinbayah, and conferred honours on 
him. This led to the loss not only of his wealth, but of his life. 

The commandant of Kinbayah, at the moment of our arrival in 
the town, was Muqbil the Tilingi, 7 who was greatly respect- 
ed by the Sultan. He had with him Shaikh Zadah of 
Ispahan who deputised for him in all his affairs. This Shaikh 
had enormous wealth, and had a profound knowledge of state affairs,

He was always sending out sums of money to his country and plan- 
ning devices to take his flight. The Sultan came to know of this, 
and he wrote to Muqbil asking him to send this person to him, and 
Muqbil having sent him without delay, he was brought before the 
Sultan who placed him under guard. It was rarely that a person 
so guarded by the Sultan made good his escape. The Shaikh, how- 
ever, struck a bargain with his keeper promising to pay him a sum 
of money, and they both fled. A trustworthy man told me that he 
met him in a corner of a mosque in the town of Qalhat adding that 
he subsequently returned to his native country, collected his trea- 
sures and had nothing to fear any more. 

The Malik Muqbil entertained us one day in his palace. By a 
curious chance, the Qazi of the town who was blind in his right 
eye, found himself seated opposite a Sharif of Baghdad, who closely 
resembled him in his appearance and his infirmity except that he 
was blind in his left eye. The Sharif looked at the Qazi and 
laughed. The Qazi having reprimanded him, he replied : 4 Do not 
reproach me, for I am better looking than you.* ‘How is that?* 
asked the Qazi. The Sharif answered: 4 Because you are blind in 
your right eye, while I am that only in my left eye.* The governor 
and the assistants laughed, and the Qazi looked foolish. He could 
make no answer, for in India the Sharifs are held in great regard. 

Among the good men of this town (Cambay) was the pilgrim 
Nasir, native of the country of Bakr, living in one of the pavilions 
of the principal mosque. We visited him and dined with him. He 
happened to go and meet the Qazi Jalal/when, in the course of his 
rebellion, he entered Kinbayah. It was reported to the Sultan that 
he had prayed in favour of the rebel. He fled for fear of being 
put to death like A1 Haidarl. Another virtuous man living in 
Kinbayah is the merchant KHwajah Ishaq who has a hermitage 
where all are fed. He spends a great deal on the fakirs and the 
indigent, and yet his wealth is ever increasing. 

From Kinbayah we proceeded to the town of Kavy, 8 situated 
on a bay where the flow and ebb of the tide are felt. It forms part 
of the. territory of the' infidel Rai Jalansy of whom 
kawa we shall speak presently. From Kavy we went to 

Qandhar, 9 a large city belonging to the infidels and 
situated on a gulf of the sea. .. ■

The Sultan of Qandhar is an infidel called Jalansy, who is 
subject to the authority of the Mussulmans, and sends an annual 
present to the king of India. When we reached 
Qandhar, he came out to receive us, and showed qandhar 
us the greatest consideration, and even quitted his 
palace to lodge us in it. Tire principal Mussulmans in his court 
came and visited us, such as the children of KHwajah Buhrah, one 
of whom was the patron of the captain Ibrahim who owned six 
vessels. At Qandhar we embarked on the sea. 

We boarded a vessel belonging to this Ibrahim and called the 
Jdkir. We took on this ship seventy horses that were part of the 
present offered by the king of India to the emperor of China, and 
we put the others with the horses of our companions in a ship 
belonging to a brother of Ibrahim and called Manuvart . Jalansy 
gave us a vessel on which we put the horses of Zahir-ud-dln, Sanbal 
and their comrades. He provisioned it for us with water, victuals 
and forage, and sent his son with us on a ship called the ’Akairy 
resembling a galley, but more roomy. It has sixty oars, and, during 
a combat, it is covered with a roof so that arrows and stones may 
not hit the rowers. I embarked on the Jakir which had fifty bow- 
men and as many Abyssinian soldiers. The latter are dominant in 
this ocean, and when there is even one of them on board a vessel, 
pirates and Hindu idolaters refrain from attacking it. 

After two days we reached the isle of Bairam (Perim) 10 , 
which is deserted and four miles from the mainland. We 
disembarked there and drew some water from a 
reservoir. The island has remained deserted since perim 
the time the Muslims invaded it against the infidels. 

Desirous of re-peopling it, the Malik-ul-Tujar, of whom we have 
spoken, has built a fortification, placed mangonels in it and esta- 
blished some Mussulmans there. 

We left Bairam and on the next day we reached the 
large town of Quqah 11 which has extensive bazaars. 

We cast anchor four miles from the shore on account kukah 
of the low tide. I got into a boat with some of my 
companions to reach the shore. The boat stuck in the 
mud, and we had to stop about a mile from the city. 
When the boat stuck, I leaned on two of my comrades. 
Though my assistants frightened me that the tide might

return before I reached Quqah and I could not swim 
very well, still I managed to reach the town in safety, and went 
round the bazaars. I saw there a mosque said to have been built 
by KHizr and Elias. I said my sunset prayer there, and came across 
a group of Haidar! fakirs accompanied by their superior. I then 
returned to my ship. 

The Sultan of Quqah is an infidel, Dunkul by name, who pro- 
fessed submission to the king of India, but was in reality a rebel. 
Three days after setting sail again, we arrived at the island of 
Sandabur , 12 where there are thirty-six villages. It is surrounded by 
a gulf, and at the ebb tide the water in it is sweet 
sandabur and agreeable, whereas it is salt and bitter during 

high tide. There are two towns in the interior, 
one an ancient construction of the infidels, and the other 
built by the Mussulmans when they first conquered the island. 
In the latter there is a great cathedral mosque comparable to 
the mosques of Baghdad: it was founded by Captain Hasan, father 
of the Sultan Jamai-ud-dm Muhammad of Hanaur, of whom and 
of my stay with whom when the island was conquered a second 
time, I shall speak later, D. V. We passed this island, and cast 
anchor at a small island near the mainland; on this island there 
were a temple, an orchard and a tank. 

When we landed on this island, we saw a Jogi leaning against 
the wall of a buikhanah , i.e.-, a temple of idols. He stood between 
two of these idols, and showed clear traces of self-mortification. 

We spoke to him, but he did not answer. We looked 
encounter to see if there was any food near him, but there was 

with a yogi none. As we were thus engaged, he gave a loud 
shout, and at once a cocoanut fell before him, 
and he presented it to us. We were surprised at this, and offered 
him pieces of gold and silver, but he did not accept them. We 
brought some provisions to him which he likewise refused. A 
mantle of camel-hair was spread before him; I turned it in my 
hands, and he handed it over to me. I had in my hand a chaplet of 
shells which he touched and I gave it to him; he polished it with 
his fingers, smelt it and kissed it, pointing to heaven and then in 
the direction of the Qiblah. My companions did not understand 
these signs, but I knew that he implied that he was a Mussulman 
who hid his religion from the inhabitants of this island. He lived 
on cocoanuts. When we took leave of him, I kissed his hand, and 
my comrades disapproved of my action. He perceived their dis-

approval, took my hand and kissed it smiling, and signalled to us 
that we might go back. We then went away, I being the last to 
leave* The Jogi pulled me by my dress, and when I turned to him 
he gave me ten pieces of gold. When, we went out of his presence, 
my friends asked me: 4 Why did he pull you? ? I replied: ‘He gave 
me these gold pieces/ 1 gave three of them to Zahir-ud-dln and 
three to Saiibal, telling them : “ This man is a Mussulman. Did you 
not see how he pointed to heaven to indicate that he acknowledged 
the Almighty God above, and how lie pointed to the direction of 
Mecca, to show his recognition of the mission of the Prophet? This 
is confirmed by his taking the chaplet.” When I had said this, they 
turned to look at him again, but he was not there. 

The next day we came to Hanaur (Honavar) situated on a large 
gulf navigable for large ships. The city is a mile and a half away 
from the sea. In the rainy season the sea is so 
disturbed that for four consecutive months there honavar 
can be no sailing except for fishing. 

The day we arrived at Hanaur, a Hindu Jogi came to meet me 
secretly, and gave me six gold pieces, saying : * The Brahmin (for 
so he called the Jogi who got my chaplet and gave me the dinars) 
sent you this money/ I took the dinars from him and offered him 
one of them., which he refused. When he went away, I informed 
my companions of this, telling them : * If you wish, you can take 
your share of this sum/ They declined, but they were astonished 
at this occurrence, and said : ‘ We added an equal sum to the six 
pieces of gold you gave us, and left the whole amount, between the 
two idols in the spot where we met this person/ I was very much 
surprised by all that concerned this man, and I kept the dinars he 
had presented to me. 

The people of Hanaur profess the doctrine of Shaft 4 ! ; they 
are pious, devoted, courageous, and wage war on the sea with infi- 
dels. They are noted for this; fortune has deserted them after they 
conquered Sandabur, as we shall narrate. 

Among the holy men I met at Hanaur was Shaikh Muhammad 
ul-Naqury who entertained me in his hermitage. He cooked food 
with his own hand, regarding as impure anything prepared by 
slaves, male or female. ■ I also met the jurisconsult Isma’il who was 
teaching the Quran. He was given to fasting, looked conceited, 
but had a generous heart. I saw too the Qazi of the town, Nur-ud- 
din 5 Aly and the preacher whose name I have forgotten. • 

* The women of Hanaur and of all the coastal districts do not wear- 
stitched cloths, but only unsewn garments. They tie one end of the

cloth round their waist and drape the rest over 
the head and chest. They are beautiful and 
chaste ; each of them wears a ring of gold 
in her nose. One notable feature is that they all know the Quran 
by heart. I saw in Hanaur thirteen schools for the 
instruction of girls, and twenty-three for boys, a 
thing 1 have not seen anywhere else. 

The people of Hanaur live by maritime trade, and own no culti- 
vated land. The inhabitants of Malabar pay a fixed sum every year 
to Sultan Jamal-ud-din. (of Hanaur) as they are 
sultan afraid of his power on the sea. His army com- 

prises six thousand men, horse and foot. This 
Sultan Jamal-ud-dxn Muhammad, son of Hasan, is one of the best 
and most powerful sovereigns. He is subject to the supremacy of an 
infidel king named Hariab 13 of whom we shall speak later. Sultan 
Jamal-ud-din is fond of praying in the company of others of the faith. 
He has the practice of going to the mosque before daybreak and 
there reading the Quran till it is dawn ; then he prays for the first 
time, and goes for a ride outside the city. He returns to the mos- 
que about nine o’clock, and, after prostrating himself there, goes 
back to his palace. He fasts on full-moon days. During my so- 
journ near him, he invited me to break the fast in his company, 
and I assisted at this ceremony as well as the jurisconsults ’Aly and 
Ismail. They placed four seats on the ground ; he sat on one of 
them and the rest of us sat on the others. 

The order observed in the Sultan’s meal is as follows: there is 
set a table of copper called fchwancha (in Persian) and on it 
they place a plate of the same metal, which they 
sultan's meal call tdlarn. A beautiful slave, clad in silk, comes 
and causes to be placed before the prince saucepans 
containing the food. She has a large spoon of copper with 
which she takes a spoonful of rice and serves it on the plate ; she 
pours ghee on it, and places some pickled pepper in bunches, green 
ginger, and pickled lemons and mangoes. The guest eats a mouthful 
and then some of the preserves. When the spoonful that she served 
on the plate is consumed, she serves another spoonful of rice, and 
serves in another bowl a roast fowl with which some more rice is 
eaten. After this second course, she fetches, still in a saucepan, 
another species of fowl and serves it; this is always eaten with rice.

tion him again.

When the different kinds of fowl have been done with, there follow 
divers sorts of fish and more rice with them. After the fish, they 
serve vegetables cooked in butter, and milk foods, also taken with 
rice. At the end of all these courses, kushdn i.e., butter-milk is 
brought, and this finishes the meal When butter-milk is served, 
it means that there is nothing more to eat. Above all, they drink 
hot water, for cold water is harmful in the rainy season. 

On another occasion I spent eleven months with the Sultan 
without ever eating bread, for the people there live only on rice. I 
also spent three years in the Maidive islands, in Silan (Ceylon) and 
in the countries of Ma’bar and Malabar, eating only rice, so that 
1 could swallow it only with water. 

The dress of the Sultan of Hanaur consists of clothes of very 
fine silk and linen; he ties a loin-cloth round his body, and wears 
two cloths one over the other ; he plaits his hair 
and ties a small turban round it. When he mounts his dress 
a horse, he puts on a tunic and two cloths over it. 

They beat a kettle-drum and sound the trumpet before him. 

This time we spent three days at his court; he gave us provi- 
sions for the journey and we took leave of him. At the end of 
three more days we reached Malabar, the land 
of pepper. It extends along the sea coast for malabar 
a length of two months’ journey, from Sandabur 
(Goa) to Kulam (Quilon) . For the whole distance, the road passes 
under the shade of trees; at every half-mile, there is a 
wooden structure with platforms on which all travellers, Muslim 
or infidel, may sit. Near each of these rest houses, there is a well 
for drinking and an infidel is placed in charge of it. He supplies 
the water in vessels to infidels; in the case of Muslims he pours the 
water into their hands, and continues to do so until they signal to 
him to stop. The idolaters of Malabar do not allow Muslims to enter 
their houses or eat from their vessels. If a Muslim should do the 
contrary, they break the vessel or give it to the Muhammadan. When 
a Muhammadan goes to a place where there is no house belonging 
to one of his class, the infidels cook the food and serve it to him 
on banana leaves ; dogs and birds eat what is left over. In all the 
places on the road through Malabar, there are Muslim houses where 
their co-religionists can alight and buy all their requirements. 
But for these, no Mussulman could travel in this country. 

On this road, which as we said extends for two months’ march, 
there is not a palm’s breadth of land that, is not cultivated. Every-

body has his own garden and his house in the 
gabdens middle, the whole being surrounded by a 

wooden enclosure. The road runs through these 
gar dens . When it comes up to the enclosure of an orchard, 
it goes up by one flight of wooden steps, and descends into the 
neighb ouring orchard by another; this happens over the whole 
length of the road. No one travels in this country on an animal, 
and only the Sultan owns horses. The principal 
palanquin vehicle of the people is a palanquin carried on 

the shoulders of slaves or hired labourers ; those 
that do not get up on a palanquin, whoever they be, go 
on foot. People who have baggages or moveables like merchand- 
ise hire out men who carry them on their backs. One merchant 
may be accompanied by about hundred men carrying his wares. 

Everyone of these men carries a stout stick fitted 
merchants with an iron point at the lower end and a 

hook of the same metal at the top ; when 
the porter is fatigued and does not find any place for resting him- 
self, he sticks his baton into the ground and suspends his burden 
on it. After rest, he takes up his charge without any one to assist 
him and resumes his march. 

I have not seen a safer road than this, for the Hindus put to 
death any one who steals a single nut. Again, when a fruit drops 
on the ground no one picks it up until the owner 
justice takes it. I heard that once several Hindus passed 

by the road and that one of them picked up a 
nut. The governor, coming to know of it, ordered a stake to 
be driven into the ground and its upper end to be cut and 
fixed on a wooden plank in such wise that a portion of it 
showed up above the plank. The culprit was extended on it and 
fixed to the stake which entered his abdomen and came out by 
the hack; he was left in this posture to serve as an example to the 
spectators. On the road there are many stakes like this, so that 
passers by may see them and be warned. 

Now, we sometimes met infidels on the road by night, who, 
when they saw us, turned aside to let us pass. Mussulmans are 
held in the highest regard in this country except that the people, 
as we said, do not eat with them or allow them to enter their 
houses. 

There are twelve infidel Sultans in Malabar ; the more power- 
ful among them having an army of fifty thousand troops, the weaker 
. ones only three thousand. But there is no discord among 


them, and the strong does not covet what the weak 
possesses. At the boundary of each state there is kings 
a wooden gate on which is engraved the name of 
the Sultan whose territory begins there ; they call it 4 the gate 
of security 5 of N. When a Mussulman or an infidel flees from 
the state of one of these princes because of some delinquency, 
and reaches the gate of security of another prince, he is safe 
and cannot be caught by him from whom he had fled though he 
may be powerful, having many troops at his disposal. 

The sovereigns of this country transmit their royalty to their 
sister’s son to the exclusion of their own children, I have not 
found this rule elsewhere, except with the Messufah who wear the 
lisdm (veil which covers the lower part of the face) and who will 
be referred to latei\ 13a When a ruler of Malabar wishes to put a stop 
to his subjects buying and selling, he gives his orders to one of his 
slaves who hangs before the shops a branch of a tree with its foliage 
' intact. No one buys or sells so long as these branches remain before 
the shops. 

The pepper-plant resembles the vine; they plant it near the 
cocoanui trees, round which they climb like the stem of the vine; 
only, unlike the vine, the pepper-plant has no ten- 
drils. The leaves are like those of the rue ; and PEPPER 
partly also resemble the leaves of a bramble. The plant 
pepper-plant bears small bunches of berries which, 
when green, resemble those of the abu-Qinmnah (raisin?). When 
autumn arrives, they gather the pepper and spread it in the sun 
on mats, as they spread grapes when they wish to dry them. They 
do this until it becomes perfectly dry and black, and then they 
sell it to the merchants. People in our country maintain that the 
wrinkles on the pepper are caused by its being roasted on the fire; 
but this is not so, and it is due only to the action of the sun. I have 
seen this in the town of Qalqot (Calicut) where they measure 
pepper by the bushel as we do millet in our lands. 

The first town of Malabar we entered was Abu Sarur (Barce- 
lore), a small place situated on a large bay and rich in cocoanuts. 
The chief of the Mussulman population here is Shaikh Jum’a, known 
as Abu Sittah 4 father of six,’ a generous man who has spent all 
his wealth on fakirs and the indigent. Two days after our depar- 
ture from this town, we reached Fakanur 
(Rakanur ), 14 a large town on a bay. There was bakanifr 
an abundance of excellent sugar-cane, unequalled ■

in the rest of the country. There are some Mussulmans and their 
chief is called Husain-ul-Salat. There is a Qazi and a preacher, 
and this Husain has built a mosque for the Friday prayer. 

The Sultan of Fakanur is an infidel called Basadav (Vasu- 
deva) . He has about thirty ships of war under the command of 
Lula, a Muslim, a bad man and a pirate who robs merchants. When 
we anchored at Fakanur, the Sultan sent his son to us to stay as 
a hostage on the vessel. When we went to see him, he entertained 
us with great cordiality for three days as a mark of respect for 
the Emperor of India and with a desire to gain by trade with our 
men. It is the custom of the country that each vessel which passes 
near a town must necessarily enter the port and offer the prince a 
present, * the right of the port 5 as it is called. If a ship fails to do 
so, the people pursue her in their vessels, bring her forcibly into 
port, impose a double tax on her and detain her as long as they 
like. 

We left Fakanur, and at the end of three days we arrived at 
Manjarur (Mangalore), 15 a large town on the bay of Dunb, the 
largest inlet in Malabar. It is here that most of the 
mangalore merchants from Fars and Yemen disembark. Pep- 
per and ginger are here in great abundance. 

The Sultan of Manjarur is one of the principal rulers of this 
country. His name is Ram-dav (Rama-deva) . There are in 
Manjarur about 4000 Mussulmans who live in a suburb. Conflicts 
occur often between them and the inhabitants of the city, and the 
Sultan reconciles them as he has need of the merchants. We saw 
in Manjarur a Qazi, a distinguished and generous man, who pro- 
fesses the doctrine of Shafi% and teaches the sciences ; his name 
is Badr-ud-dln of Ma’bar. He came first to visit us on board and 
asked us to land and go into the town. We answered him : “ We 
will not do so, until the Sultan sends his son to stay on board.” — 

‘ The Sultan of Fakanur/ he replied, 4 did so only because the Mus- 
sulmans living in his town had no power; but here the Sultan 
fears us/ We persisted in our refusal until the Sultan sent his 
son as the Sultan of Fakanur had done. When we landed he treat- 
ed us with great consideration, and we stayed there three days. 

Then we left for Hily 16 and reached it in two days. It is a

large ships. The ships from China come here ; 
they enter only this port and the ports of d’ely 
Kulam and Calicut. Hfly is respected alike 
by Mussulmans and idolaters on account of its great mosque, a 
source of blessings and of light. Sailors make vows of consider- 
able offerings to it, and it possesses a rich treasury, placed under 
the supervision of the preacher Husain and of Hasan-ul-vazzan 
(the weigher) the chief of the Muslims. There are in this mosque 
a certain number of students who learn the sciences and receive 
stipends from its revenues. It has a kitchen whence food is sup- 
plied to travellers and poor Muslims in the town. I met in the 
mosque the virtuous theologian, Sa’Id by name, a native of 
Maddshau. He had a fine figure and a good character and he 
fasted often. He told me that he had lived at Mecca for fourteen 
years and as many at Medina, that he had seen the amir of Mecca, 
Abu Nemi, and of Medina, Mansur, son of Jamaz, and lastly that 
he had travelled in India and China. 

From Hily we went to Jurfattan , 17 at a distance of three para- 
sangs . There I saw a theologian from Baghdad, a man of great 
merit, named Sarsary, after a village ten miles 

from Baghdad on the road to Kufah He cannanore 

had a very rich brother living at Jurfattan who 
had young children. This brother had died commending the 
infants to him ; I left him as he was preparing to take them 
to Baghdad. For it is the custom among the people of India and 
of Sudan not to interfere in the succession to strangers who die 
among them, though they leave behind millions in gold. Their 
money remains in the hands of the chief of the Mussulmans till it 
is received by those lawfully entitled to it. 

The Sultan of Jurfattan, Kdyal, by name, is one of the most 
powerful rulers of Malabar, and he owns a number of vessels which 
sail to ‘Aman (Oman) , Ears and Yemen. Dahfattan 
and Budfattan are included in his state. We sailed dharmapatah 
from Jurfattan to Dahfattan, 17 ® a large town on a 
bay, with many orchards in it. Here are found cocoanut palms, 
pepper and betel leaf and nut, and much qalqds (colocassia) 
with which the Hindus cook their food ; and as for banana, 
I have not seen any country which produces it more or 
cheaper. We have at Dahfattan a very large bam or tank, five

hundred feet long and three hundred broad. It has a facing of 
red stone and has on its sides twenty-eight domes of stone, each 
containing four seats of the same material. Each of these pavilions 
is reached by a flight of stone steps. In the middle of the tank 
there is a large pavilion three stories high, each of them having 
four seats. I heard that this ham was erected by the father of 
Sultan Koyal. Opposite to this, there is a cathedral mosque for 
the Mussulmans. The mosque has steps by which the faithful 
descend to the tank and wash themselves. The theologian Husain 
told me that the mosque and the ham were built by one of the 
ancestors of Koyal who was a Mussulman; his conversion came 
about in the following marvellous manner. 

Near the mosque I saw a beautiful green tree with leaves like 
those of the fig, except that they were smooth. It was surround- 
ed by a wall and had a niche or small chapel near it where I pray- 
ed and kneeled twice. The tree is called dirakht^-sliahadatj 1 the 
tree of testimony/ I was told that every year when autumn 
came this tree dropped one leaf which had changed its colour first 
to yellow, and then into red, that on this leaf was 
written with the pen of divine power, the words : ‘ There is no 
God but God, and Muhammad is the Prophet of God/ Husain and 
many other trustworthy men told me that they had seen this 
leaf and read the inscription on it. Husain added that when the 
time came for the leaf falling, reliable persons among the Muslims 
as well as the infidels came and sat beneath the tree, and when 
the leaf fell, the Muslims took one half of it, the other half being 
deposited in the treasury of the infidel Sultan. The people use 
it often for the purpose of curing their diseases . 1713 

This tree was the cause of the grandfather of Koyal going 
over to Islam. He could read Arabic, and when he deciphered the 
inscription and understood its import, he embraced the Islamic 
religion and practised it to perfection. His story is transmitted by 
tradition among Hindus. Husain told me that one of the children 
of this Sultan returned to idolatry after the death of his father, 
behaved unjustly, and ordered the tree to be torn up by the roots. 
The order was executed and no vestige of the tree was left. But

it grew up again and regained its original state. And the king 
died suddenly soon after. 

From Dahfattan we proceeded to Budfattan , 18 a considerable 
town also on a bay. There is a mosque here near the sea outside 
the town, and Muslim strangers resort to it, for 
there are no Mussulmans at Budfattan, most of budfattan 
the inhabitants being Brahmin idolaters who hate 
Mussulmans. The harbour here is one of the most beautiful; the 
water is sweet, and there is an abundance of areca-nut which is 
exported to India 19 and China. 

I was told that the reason why the Brahmins have allowed 
this mosque to remain is that one of them demolished its roof to 
make the roof of his own house with the material ; but the house 
caught fire and he perished with his children and his moveables. 
The Hindus respect this temple, and no longer entertain any ill 
designs against it. They render homage to it, store water before it 
so that travellers may drink, and’ place a trellis at the gate to 
prevent birds entering in. 

Then we sailed to Bandanna, a large and beautiful town with 
gardens and bazaars. Here the Mussulmans occupy three quarters, 
each having a mosque ; the chief temple on the 
beach is admirable ; it has belvederes and halls fanbarina 
facing the sea. The Qazi and preacher of Fandarma 
is a man from ‘ Aman and he has a good brother. The ships from 
China pass the winter here. 

We went from Fandarma to Calicut one of the great 
ports of Malabar. Men from China, Java, Ceylon, 
the Maldives, Yemen and Fars come here as well as calicut 
merchants from all parts. Its harbour is one of the 
largest in the world. 

The Sultan of Calicut is an idolater known as the Samuri 
(the Zamorin) . He is advanced in age and shaves his beard, like 
some of the Greeks. I saw him at Calicut and spoke to him, as it 
was God’s pleasure. The chief of the merchants in this town was 
Ibrahim., the chief of the port, a native of Bahrain. He is a distin- 
guished man endowed with generous qualities; the merchants meet 
in his house and dine at his table. The Qazi of Calicut 1 was 
Fakhr-ud-dm 4 Usman, a distinguished and generous man. The

head of the hermitage was the Shaikh Shahab-ud-dln of Kazrun, 
and the people of India and China vow and send offerings to him 
(may God enable us to profit by his merits!). In this town also 
lives the very rich and celebrated ship-owner Misqal, who posses- 
ses numerous vessels employed in his trade with India, 20 China, 
Yemen and Fars. 

When we reached the town, Ibrahim, the chief of the port, 
came out to receive us, and so did the Qazx, the Shaikh Shahab- 
ud-din, the principal merchants and the deputy (naib) of the 
Hindu sovereign, Qalaj by name. They had drums, trumpets 
bugles and standards on their ships. We entered the harbour in 
great pomp, such as I did not see elsewhere in these lands. But it 
was a joy to be followed by distress. We remained in the harbour 
of Calicut, where there were already thirteen vessels from China. 
We then went into the city and each of us was accommodated in 
a house. We remained there three months awaiting the day of 
our voyage to China. We were the guests of the idolatrous 
sovereign. Voyages in the Sea of China are made only in Chinese 
vessels, and now, we shall describe the arrangements relating to 
them. 


TYPES OP 

CHINESE 

VESSELS 


There are three kinds of Chinese vessels: 1. large ships, called 
junks; 2. middling ones called zu-s and 3. the smallest, kakams. 
On the large vessels there are three sails or more, up to a dozen. 

Their sails are made of cane reeds plaited together 
like mats ; they are never lowered, but are turned 
about according to the direction of the wind. When 
the ships are anchored, the sails are allowed to 
float in the wind. Each of these ships is manned by a thousand men, 
six hundred sailors and four hundred soldiers among whom are 
archers, men armed with shields, and persons who throw naphtha. 
Each large vessel is followed by three smaller ones, a middle-sized, 
a third and a fourth sized. These vessels are built only in the city 
of Zaitun in China or in Sain-kalan (Canton) . This is how they 
build the ships: They erect two walls of wood and fill the inter- 
space between them by means of very thick planks joined together 
along their length and breadth by large nails each three cubits 
long. When the two walls have been joined together by means of 
these planks, they lay on the bottom of the vessel and then push 
the whole of it out on the sea where the construction is finished. 
The planks and the two walls which touch the water serve the 
crew for washing and other needs. On the sides of these planks are , 
found the oars which are as big as masts and are manipulated each

by ten or fifteen men together, standing. They make four decks 
on a vessel ; it contains chambers, cabins, and saloons for the merch- 
ants. Many of these cabins contain chambers and water closets. 
They have keys and their occupants lock them. They take their 
wives and concubines with them. It often happens that a man lives 
in his cabin unknown to any others on board till they meet on 
their arrival in some place. 

The sailors’ children live in these cabins. They grow vegeta- 
bles, pulses and ginger in wooden tubs. The commander of a ship 
is like a great amir ; when he disembarks, archers and* Abyssinians 
march in front of him with javelins, swords, drums, bugles and 
trumpets. When he arrives at the inn where he is to live, they 
place their lances on either side of the door and continue to do so 
throughout his stay. Some of the Chinese own many ships on which 
they send their factors abroad; in the whole world there is no peo- 
ple richer than the Chinese. 

When the time came for sailing to China, the Sultan, ie, the 
Zamorin, equipped for us one of the thirteen junks that were in 
the port of Calicut. The commander of the ship was one Sulaiman 
ul-Safdi of Sham 21 already known to me.' I said to him : ‘ I want a 
cabin all to myself and for my slave-girls as it is my 
rule never to travel without them.’ He replied, ‘ The B00KING 
Chinese merchants have taken the cabins for the _ T 
voyage both ways. My son-in-law has a cabin 
which I shall give you, but it has no lavatory ; it is possible that 
you may be able to exchange it for another/ I issued instruc- 
tions to my companions, and they took on board all my luggage and 
the slaves, male and female. This was on a Thursday; I remained 
on shore to get through my Friday prayer and then join them. The 
Malik Sanbal and Zahir-ud-din also embarked with the present. 
Meanwhile, Hilal, a eunuch of mine, came to me on Friday morn- 
ing and said: ‘The cabin we have taken is very small and incon- 
venient/ I mentioned this to the captain of the ship, and he answer- 
ed: Tt cannot be helped; but if you like to travel by the Kakam, 
you may have cabins of your choice/ I accepted this, and in ac- 
cordance with my instructions my companions transported my slave 
girls and my luggage to the Kdkam and settled there before prayer 
time on Friday. Now it is usual for the sea to become rough after 
four in the evening, and then no one can embark. All the junks 
had gone except the one which contained the present, one other

the owners of which had resolved to spend the winter at Fanda- 
rina, and the Kakam mentioned above- We spent 
storm the Friday night on the shore, not being able to 

embark on the Kakam , and those on the Kakam 
being unable to come to us. I had only a carpet with 
me to sleep on. On Saturday morning both the junk and 
the Kakam had drifted far from the port. The junk bound 
for Fandanna was dashed against rocks and wrecked ; a part of 
the crew perished, the rest escaped. There was on this ship a 
slave girl well beloved of a merchant who offered ten pieces to any 
one who should save her. She had caught hold of a piece of wood 
at the back of the junk, and one of the sailors of Hormuz, in res- 
ponse to this appeal, rescued the young girl from danger; but he 
refused to receive the money, saying: T did it only out of the love 
of God ! * When night came, the junk which carried the pre- 
sent was also dashed against the rocks, and all the men in it perish- 
ed. The next morning we examined the spots where their bodies 
lay; I saw that Zahir-ud-din had his head shattered, and that a nail 
had entered one of the temples of Sanbal and come out by the other; 
we prayed over their bodies and buried them. I saw the Hindu Sul- 
tan of Calicut, wearing a large white cloth round his waist from the 
navel down to the knees and a small turban on his head ; he was 
bare-footed, and a parasol was held over his head by a young slave. 
A fire was lit before him on the beach, and his bodyguard were 
beating the people who were there to stop their stealing anything 
that the sea might cast up. The custom of Malabar is that every 
time there occurs a ship wreck, what is recovered goes to the 
treasury; this town is however an exception; indeed here the legiti- 
mate owners receive it, and this is why this city is flourishing and 
strangers come here in large numbers. 

When the crew of the Kakam saw what had befallen the junk, 
they set sail and went away carrying all my property and slaves of 
both sexes. I was alone on the beach with only one slave whom I 
had enfranchised. When he saw what had happened to me, he 
left me, and I had nothing more with me than the ten pieces of 
gold which the yogi had given me and the carpet I had spread on the 
ground. The people there told me that the Kakam should neces- 
sarily enter the port of Kulam (Quilon) . I resolved then to go to 
this town, at a distance of ten days by land or by river 22 — if any 
one prefers this. I started by the river and engaged a Muslim for 
carrying my carpet. The custom of the Hindus, when they travel

by this river, is to disembark in the evening and spend the night in 
villages on its banks; the next morning they get back to the boat. 
We did likewise. There was no Mussulman on the boat except the 
one I had in my employ. He drank wine with the infidels when 
we disembarked and behaved to me like a drunken man. This 
annoyed me greatly. 

The fifth day after our departure we reached Kanji-kari on the 
peak of a mountain; it is inhabited by Jews who have one among 
themselves for their chief and pay a poll tax to the Sultan of 
Kulam (Quilon) . 

All the trees found near this river are cinnamon and brazil. 
Here they are used as firewood, and during this voyage we cooked 
our food in fire lighted with this wood. On the tenth day we came 
to the town of Kulam (Quilon), one of the most 
beautiful towns in Malabar. Its bazaars are quilon 
splendid and its merchants are known as 
Solis . 23 They are very rich ; any one of them will buy a vessel 
with its tackle and load it with merchandise from his own house. 
There are in Kulam many Muhammadan merchants ; their chief is 
‘ Ala-ud-din Alavji, native of Avail in c Iraq. He is a rafxzi (or 
partizan of ‘Ali) and has friends who openly follow the same doc- 
trine. The Qazi of Kulam is a distinguished man from Qazwin; 
the head of all the Muslims in this town is Muhammad Shah Ban- 
dar, the chief of the port, who has an excellent and generous 
brother, Taqi-ud-din. The principal mosque there is admirable; it 
was built by the merchant KHwaja Muhazzab. Kulam is, of all 
the towns of Malabar, the nearest to China, and most of the Chinese 
merchants come there. Mussulmans are honoured and respected 
there. 

The Sultan of Kulam is an idolater, Tirwari (Tiruvadi) by 
name ; he respects Muslims and severely punishes thieves and male- 
factors. I was an eyewitness to the following, among other events, 
at Kulam; an archer from Iraq killed one of his companions and 
fled to the house of Alavji. This murderer had enormous wealth. 
The Mussulmans wished to bury the victim, but the officers of the 
ruler stopped this saying: ‘he should not be buried till you sur- 
render his murderer who will be put to death to avenge him/ They 
left the body in the coffin in front of the Alavji’s house till it began 
to rot. Alavji then delivered the assassin to the officers offering

to give over to them all his wealth if they would spare his life; but 
they refused, put the criminal to death and then buried his victim. 

I was told that the ruler of Kulam once went out for a ride 
outside the town. His path lay among orchards and his son-in-law, 
a prince, went with him. The latter picked up a 
stern rule mango which had dropped outside one of the 
orchards, and the Sultan saw this. He at once 
ordered that the prince should have his body split in twain, 
and each half exhibited on a cross on either side of the road, one 
half of the mango being put alongside each half of the body, to 
serve as a warning. 

Another like occurrence which happened at Calicut was this. 
The nephew of the lieutenant of the ruler took by force a sword 
belonging to a Muslim merchant. The merchant complained to the 
uncle of the culprit and he promised to inquire into the affair. 
While he was seated at the gate of his house, he saw his nephew 
wearing this sword on his side; he called him and said: “ This is 
the sword of the Mussulman.” “Yes”, answered the nephew. “Did 
you buy it of h im?” asked his uncle. “No” replied the young man. 
Then the viceroy asked his followers to seize him and cut his neck 
with the same sword. 

I spent some days at Kulam in the hermitage of ShaiWi 
Fakhr-ud-din, son of Shaikh Shahab-ud-dln Alkazaruni, superior 
of the hermitage at Calicut. I had no news regarding the Kakam. 
But then the ambassadors of the king of China who had accompa- 
nied us and embarked on one of the junks above mentioned arrived 
there. Their ship had also been wrecked; the Chinese merchants 
provided them with clothes and they returned to China where I 
met them again later. 

I wanted to return from Kulam to the Sultan of Delhi to tell 
him what had happened to his present; but I was afraid that he 
might find fault with my conduct and reproach me for having 
separated myself from the present. I resolved then to go back to 
Sultan Jamal-ud-din of Hanaur and stay with him till I should get 
news of the Kakam. I returned to Calicut and there I found 
vessels belonging to Sultan of India on which he had sent an Arab 
amir 24 named Sayyid Ab-ul-Hasan. This person was one of the 
bard-i-dari (Pers. pardah-dar) , i.e., the chief door-keeper. The 
Sultan had sent him with much money for enrolling as many Arabs 
as possible from the territories of Hormuz and of Qatlf ; for this

prince has an affection for Arabs, 1 went and saw this amir, and 
found him inclined to spend the winter at Calicut 
and then go to the land of the Arabs. I consulted back at 
him on my return to the court of the Sultan ; but calicut 
he did not give his approval. However, I em- 
barked with him at Calicut. We were then at the end of the season 
for these voyages. We sailed during the first half of the day after 
which we anchored till the next morning. We encountered four 
ships of war on the way, but they did us no harm, though we were 
afraid of them. 

We reached the city of Hanaur and I went to meet the Sultan 
and salute him. He lodged me in a house where there was no ser- 
vant, and invited me to recite the prayer with him. 

I sat most of the time in his mosque and I read the at honavae 
whole of the Quran each clay. Later I read it twice 
a day beginning my first reading soon after the morning prayer 
and closing it about one o’clock in the afternoon. I then repeated 
my ablutions and resumed reading, completing the second reading 
by sunset. 1 continued to do this for three months, of which I spent 
forty days fully in religious exercises. 

Sultan Jamal-ud-dm had equipped fifty-two vessels with a view 
to subduing Sandabur (Goa). The sovereign of this island had 
quarrelled with his son, and the latter had written to Sultan Jamal- 
ud-dm requesting him to come and take the town, and promising 
to embrace Islam and marry the sister of the Sultan, 

When the vessels were ready, I wanted to go with expedition 
them for the holy war. I consulted the Quran. T q goa 
On the first page I lighted on, I read the 
words: “In them (churches, mosques, etc.) the name of God is 
often mentioned. Certainly God will help those who help him.” 35 
I rejoiced at this, and when the Sultan came for his prayer, at f opr 
in the evening, I said to him: £ I wish to go also/ ‘ Then you will be 
the chief of the expedition/ he replied. I told him what I had read 
in the Quran when I opened it. This pleased him, and he resolved 
to join the expedition himself though he had not thought of it before. 
He embarked on one of the vessels and I with him. It was on a 
Saturday. We reached Sandabur and entered its bay on Monday 
evening. We found the people ready for the fight, having already 
set up their mangonels. We passed the night near the town, and 
at dawn, the drums, trumpets and bugles resounded, and the ships 
advanced. The besieged made a discharge from their mangonels.

I saw a stone strike one of the men near the Sultan. The men 
from the ships jumped into the water, with shields and swords in 
their hands. The Sultan got into an 9 Akairy , a kind of boat. I jump- 
ed into the water with the rest. There were near us two tartans 26 
open abaft with horses in them. They are so constructed that a 
cavalier can mount his horse in them and put on his armour and 
then come out. It was thus that cavaliers were mounted on these 
two ships. 

God granted the victory to the Mussulmans and Sandabur was 
conquered. We entered the town at the point of the sword, and 
most of the infidels took refuge in the palace of their ruler. We fired 
the palace, and when they came out, we seized them. The Sultan 
spared their lives and restored to them their women and children. 
They were ten thousand in number, and they got a suburb of the 
city for their residence. The Sultan himself occu- 
victohy pied the palace and gave the neighbouring houses 

to his courtiers. He gave me a young captive girl 
named Lemky, whom I called Mubaraka (blessed) . Her husband 
wanted to buy her hack, but I refused. The Sultan presented me 
a costly robe of Egyptian material found among the treasures of 
the infidel ruler. I stayed with the Sultan at Sandabur from the 
day of the conquest, the 13th of the first Jumadi, to the middle of 
Sha’ban ; 27 then I sought permission to leave, and he made me 
promise that I would come back to him. 

I left by sea for Hanaur whence I went in succession to Fakanur, 
Manjarur, Hily, Jurfattan, Dahfattan, Budfattan, Fandarlna, Calicut

beautiful town, where they make the fabrics that go 
beyporb by its name. I stayed there long and then returned 

to Calicut. Two of my slaves who had embarked 
on the Kakam came to this town and informed me that the slave 
girl who was with child and for whom I was much concerned 
was dead ; that the ruler of Javah 23 had appropriated the other

that my comrades were dispersed in China, Javah and Bengal. 30

When I heard this, I returned to Hanaur and Sandabur ; I 
reached Sandabur at the end of Muharram and stayed there till 
the second day of the month Rabf II. The infidel Sultan of this 
town, against whom we had succeeded, now advanced to recap- 
ture the city, and all the infidels fled to his side. The troops of the 
Sultan were scattered in the villages and they abandoned us. The 
infidels besieged us and pressed us hard. When the situation be- 
came difficult, I came out of the town, still being 
besieged, and returned to Calicut. I made up Maldives 
my mind to go to Zfbat-ul-Mahal (the Mal- 
dives) of which I had heard much. Ten days after * we 
embarked at Calicut, we reached the islands of Zibat-ul-Mahal. 
Zibat figures as the feminine of zlb (wolf, in Arabic; it is an altera- 
tion from Sanskrit Dvipa, island). These islands are among the 
most marvellous in the world and number nearly two thousand. 
About a hundred of these islands or a little less are found grouped 
together in a circle in the form of a ring ; the whole group has 
one entrance like a gateway, and ships enter only by this. When a 
ship arrives near any one of these, it is absolutely necessary for it 
to take one of the inhabitants as a guide, in order that under his 
guidance it may cross to the other islands. They are all so close to 
one another that as soon as you leave one island the tops of the 
palms on another island become visible. If a vessel loses its 
course, it cannot enter these islands and the wind sweeps it to 
Ma’bar (Coromandel coast) or to Silan (Ceylon) . 

The people in these islands are all Mussulmans, pious and 
honest. The islands are divided into regions or c climates/ each 
ruled by a governor styled Karduy. The regions are: 1. Balbur; 
2. Kannalus ; 3. Mahal, which gives its name to all the islands and 
forms the residence of the sovereigns ; 4. Taladib ; 5. Karaiduv ; 6. 
Tahn ; 7. Taldumtl, 8. Haldumti, differing from the preceding only 
in the first letter ; 9. Barldu ; 10. Kandakal ; 11. Maluk ; 12. Sawxd. 
The last is the farthest of all. All the Maidive 
islands are destitute of grains, except that a food 
cereal resembling millet is grown in the 
region of Sawxd and transported thence to Mahal The people sub- 
sist on a fish similar to lairun and called Qulb-ul-mas. 31 It has red 
flesh ; it has no fat, but it smells like mutton.. When they catch 
it, they cut each fish into four, cook it lightly and then place 
it in a palm-leaf basket and smoke it. They eat it when it is quite 
dry. From here it is also exported to India, China and Yemen.

Most of the trees on these islands are cocoa-palms ; together 
with fish, they provide the subsistence of the people. The 
cocoa-palm is a marvellous tree. Each tree yields twelve 
clusters each year, one every month. Some are small, others 
large, some dry, the rest green, and this goes on continually. From 
the fruit they make milk, oil and honey. With its honey they 
make sweetmeats, pastries, eaten with dried cocoanuts. All the 
cocoanut foods and fish which the people here live on are a strong 
incentive to venery. The people of these islands are capable of 
surprising things in this line. I had in this country four wives, not 
to speak of concubines. I went round to all of them by day and 
spent the night with each one of them by turns ; I lived like this 
for the year and half that I spent in the Maldives. 

We find among the vegetal products of these islands the 
Jamun (Eugenia Jambu ) , the citron, lemon and colocassia. The 
natives prepare a flour from the root of colocassia ; from this 
flour they make a kind of vermicelli, which when cooked in cocoa- 
nut milk makes one of the best dishes known ; I liked it very much. 

The people of the Maidive islands are honest and pious, of 
sincere faith and steady mind. They eat what is lawful, and their 
prayers are fulfilled. When one of them meets another, he says 
to him : 4 God is my Lord, Muhammad is my 
people prophet ; I am a poor ignoramus. 5 Their bodies 

are weak ; they do not engage in combats or 
warfare, and prayer is their weapon. One day, when I 
ordered the right hand of a thief to be cut off, many of the natives 
who were present in the court-room fainted. The pirates of India 
do not attack them, and cause them no fear, for they have found 
by experience that any one who takes anything of theirs soon 
encounters misfortune. When enemy ships come to this country, 
they seize the strangers whom they find there, but do no harm to 
any one of the natives. If an infidel takes something for himself, 
be it only a lemon, the chief of the infidels punishes him, and 
causes him to be beaten so severely that he dreads the results of 
the act. If it were otherwise, surely these people would be the 
most contemptible of men in the eyes of their aggressors, on 
account of the feebleness of their bodies. In each of their islands, 
there are beautiful mosques, and most of their buildings are of 
wood. 

The islanders are a clean people; they avoid filth, and the 
majority bathe twice a day to keep clean because of the extreme 
heat of the climate and the profuse perspiration . They make much 
use of scented oils like that of sandalwood and anoint themselves

with musk got from Maqdashu. 31a It is one of their habits that, after 
morning prayer, each woman goes to meet her husband or her son, 
with a box of collyrium, rose-water and the oil of musk ; he applies 
the collyrium to his eyelashes, and rubs himself with rose-water 
and musk-oil, thus polishing his skin and removing all trace of 
fatigue from his countenance. 

The dress of these people consists of simple cloths ; one they 
wear round their loins in the place of drawers, and others of 
material called Siydb-ul-waliydn 32 on their backs, 
as Muslim pilgrims wear the ihram. Some bress 
wear a turban while others substitute a small 
kerchief. When any one meets the Qazi or the preacher, he 
removes his garment from his shoulders exposing his back 
and thus accompanies him to his house. Another custom of 
theirs is this: when one of them marries and goes to his wife’s 
house, she spreads, in his honour, cotton cloth on the ground from 
the threshold of her house to the nuptial chamber ; 
she places handfuls of cowries on either side of his marriage 
path, and herself stands expecting him near customs 
the entrance to the apartment. When he comes 
near her, she throws a cloth at his feet, which his servants 
take. If the woman goes to her husband’s house, the same forms 
are observed by the husband. The same rule is observed by the 
people of these islands when they salute their sovereign, and it is 
absolutely necessary to throw cloth at his feet on such occasions. 

Their buildings are of wood and they take care to raise the 
floor of their houses well above the ground level as a precaution 
against humidity, for the soil is moist in these islands. They do 
this by employing cut stones of two or three cubits 
each in several rows and laying beams of cocoa- houses 
nut palms across; then. '.they raise the walls 
with planks. They give evidence of very great skill in this 
work. In the vestibule of the house they build an apartment 
called mdlam where the master of the house sits with his friends. 
This room has two doors, one opening on the vestibule by which 
strangers enter and the other on the side of the house by which 
the master of the -house enters. Near this chamber there is a jar 
full of water, and a vessel called walanj made from the shell of the 
cocoanut. It has a handle two cubits long, and it is enough for rais- 
ing water from the wells which are not deep,

All the inhabitants of the Maldives, high and low, are bare- 
footed; the streets there are swept very clean; they are shaded 
with trees, and to walk there is like walking in a garden. Still, it 
is essential for every person before entering a house to wash his 
feet with the water from the jar placed near the malam and to rub 
them with a rough mat of palm-fibre which he finds there. Every 
body who enters a mosque also does likewise. 

When a vessel arrives, usually the people of the neighbouring 
island come in small boats bringing betel and cocoanut to meet the 
visitors ; each one offers these to whomsoever he 
hospitality likes among the persons on the ship, and 
thus becomes his host, and carries to his house the 
goods belonging to his guest as if he were one of his near 
relatives. Any one among the newcomers that wants to marry 
may do so, on condition that at the time of his departure he 
divorces his wife, for the people of Maldives never leave their 
country. If a person does not marry, his food is cooked and serv- 
ed by the lady of the house where he lodges, and she supplies him 
the provisions for his journey at the time of his departure ; in re- 
turn for all of which she is content to receive the smallest present 
from him. The gain to the treasury, called bandar , consists in the 
right to purchase a certain portion of all the merchandise in the 
vessel at a fixed price, whether it is worth that or more ; they call 
this the law of bandar . This bandar has, in each island a wooden 
warehouse where the governor, Le., the Kardury, gathers, buys, and 
barters all the merchandise. The natives buy earthenware with 
poultry, and one pot will fetch five or six chickens here. 

From these islands are exported fish, as already mentioned, 
cocoanuts, cloths, waliydn and cotton turbans. Also brass vessels 
commonly used by the natives, cowries and qanbar 
exports i.e., fibrous rind of the cocoanut. The natives mace- 

rate this rind in pits dug on the seashore and then 
beat it with mallets ; then the women spin it ; they make 
thread from it for sewing together the planks of ships 
and export it to China, India and Yemen in the form of ropes. 
The qanbar is better than hemp. It is with such cords that the 
ships of India and Yemen are sewn; for the Indian ocean is full of 
rocks ; and if a vessel joined with iron nails strikes against a rock 
it would fall to pieces, whereas if it is sewn with cords it gains a 
certain elasticity and does not break. 

The inhabitants of these islands use cowries as their money. 
This is the name of an animal (a mollusc) which is got from the 



IBN BATTUTA 


253 


sea and deposited in pits dug on the shore. Its flesh disappears and 
only its white shell remains. A hundred of these 
shells is called sydh , and seven hundred fdl ; 12,000 cowuies 
form a kuttdi , and 100,000 a bustu. They settle 
accounts in the bazaar with these cowries on the basis 
of four bustu for a gold dinar. They often fall in price so that 
twelve bustu are sold for a dinar. The islanders sell them to the 
people of Bengal 33 in exchange for rice, for cowries are used as 
money also there. They are sold also to the Yemenites who use 
them as ballast for their ships in the place of sand. These cowries 
form the medium of exchange among the negroes also in their 
native country. I saw them sold at Maly and at Juju (Gogo) on 
the basis of 1150 for a gold dinar. 

The women of these isles do not cover their heads, not even 
their queen. They comb their hair and gather it on one side. 
Most of them wear only one cloth which covers 
them from the navel downwards ; the rest women 
of the body remains bare. It is in this dress 
that they walk about in the bazaars and elsewhere. When I 
held the office of Qazi in these isles, I made efforts to put an end to 
this habit and to get them to clothe themselves, but I could not 
succeed. No woman was admitted to my presence in a case unless 
her body was covered ; but beyond this I could do nothing against 
this usage. Some women wear, in addition to the cloth, a chemise 
with short and broad sleeves. I had some slave girls who dressed 
like the inhabitants of Delhi. They covered their heads, but this 
rather disfigured than adorned them, as they were not used to it. 

The women of Maldives adorn themselves with bracelets, 
covering both their arms with these from wrist to elbow. These 
jewels are of silver ; only the wives of the Sultan and his relations 
wear bracelets of gold. They have also anklets, and golden collars 
round their necks. One of their singular habits is to seek employ- 
ment as household servants for a fixed wage of not more than five 
dinars, their maintenance being also a charge on their employer. 
They do not consider this dishonourable and most of the girls follow 
this practice. You find ten or twenty such girls in a rich man’s 
house. Each servant is charged with the cost of any vessels 
broken by her. When a girl wishes to change from one house to 
another, her new master lends her the sum she owes to her former 
employer, and she remits it to him. The chief occupation of these 
hired women is to spin qanbar.

It is easy to get married in these islands because of the small- 
ness of the dowry and the approval with which intercourse with 
women is viewed. Most men say nothing about the nuptial gift; 

they are satisfied with pronouncing the creed of 
temporary Islam and giving a nuptial gift in conformity with 
marriage law. When ships arrive, their crews marry wives, 

and they divorce them before their departure; it is 
a sort of temporary marriage. The women of Maldives never leave 
their country. I have not seen any place in the world where the 
company of women is more agreeable. In the native households, the 
wife does not entrust to any one the task of serving her husband; 
she serves his food, cleans up after his meal, and washes his hands; 
she offers him water for his ablutions and she covers his feet when 
he goes to sleep. The wife never eats with her husband, and no 
man knows what his wife eats. I married several women when I 
was there ; some of them ate with me at my request, others refused 
so that I never succeeded in my efforts to see them at their table. 

The motive for which the people of these islands embraced 
Islam; description of evil spirits which caused damage to them every 
month : 

Trustworthy men among the inhabitants of the Maldives, such 
as the theologian ‘ Isa of Yemen, the theologian and professor £ Aly, 
the QazI ‘Abd-ul-lah and others told me that the people of these 
islands were idolaters, and that there appeared before them every 
month an evil spirit, from among the spirits that came from the 
sea. It resembled a vessel full of lights. The custom of the 
natives who saw this was to get hold of a young virgin, adorn her 
and conduct her to a butkkanah? 4 i.e., an idol temple, which was 
built on the beach and had a window through which she could be 
seen. There they left her for a night, and came back in the morn- 
ing; then they found the young girl deflowered and dead. They did 
not miss drawing lots each month, and whoever had his name 
chosen gave up his daughter. Later on there arrived in that place 
a Maghribi called Ab-ul-Barkat, the Berber, who knew the illus- 
trious Quran by heart. He stayed in the house of an old woman in 
the island Mahal. One day when he visited his hostess, he found 
that she had gathered her family together and that these women 
wept as if they had gone to a funeral He questioned them on the 
subject of their sorrow, but they did not tell him the cause. ' A 
dragoman turned up and informed him that the lot had fallen on 
the old lady, and that she had only one daughter whom the evil

spirit would kill Ab-ul-Barkat told the old lady : “ I shall go to- 
night in the place of your daughter.” Now he was completely 
without a beard, and they brought him in the night and left him 
within the temple after he had finished his ablutions. He started 
to recite the .Quran ; then he perceived the demon by the window 
and continued his recitation. As soon as the demon came within 
hearing distance, he plunged into the sea, and when morning came, 
the Maghrib! was still engaged in reciting the Quran. The old 
woman, her family and the people of the island came as usual to 
remove the body of the girl and bum it. They saw the stranger 
who recited the Quran and took him to their king, called 
Shinurazah , 35 and reported to him this occurrence. The king was 
astonished at it ; the Maghrib! bade him embrace Islam and roused 
in him the desire to do so. Shinurazah told him ; “ Remain with 
me for a month, and if you repeat once more what you have done 
and escape the evil spirit, I shall change my faith ” The 
stranger lived among the idolaters, and God ordained that 
the king receive the true faith. He became a Muslim 
before the end of the month, as also his wives, children 
and his courtiers. When the next month began, the Maghrib! was 
conducted to the temple of idols ; but the demon did not come, 
and the Berber recited the Quran till the morning. The Sultan 
and his subjects came in the morning and found him thus engaged. 
They broke the idols and demolished the temple. The people of 
the island embraced Islam and sent messengers to the other islands, 
the inhabitants of which were also converted. The Maghrib! 
remained among these people greatly esteemed by them. The 
natives began to profess his doctrine which was that of the Imam 
Malik. Even to-day, they venerate the Maghribls* because of him. 
He built a mosque, which is known under his name. I read the 
following inscription engraved on wood on the grilled tribune of 
the great mosque : “ The Sultan Ahmad Shinurazah has embraced 
Islam at the hands of Ab-ul-Barkat, the Berber, and the Maghrib!. 
This Sultan has assigned a third of the imposts on these islands as 
alms to the travellers in recognition of his having embraced Islam 
by their intervention. This portion of the taxes still bears a name 
which recalls this circumstance. 

Because of the demon spoken of here, many of the islands of 
the Maldives were depopulated before their conversion to Islam. 
When we entered the country, I had no knowledge of this event. 
One night, when I was attending to my business, I suddenly heard

the people reciting in a high voice the formulas : “ There is no 
god but God 55 and “ God is Almighty/' . I saw children carrying 
the Quran on their heads, and women who struck on basins and 
vases of copper. I was surprised at what they did, and I said : 

“ What has happened to you ?” They replied : “ Have you not 

looked at the sea? 5 ' I then turned to the sea and noticed a kind of 
a great ship seemingly full of lamps and stoves. They told me : 

“ It is the demon ; it generally appears once a month. But when we 
do what you see us doing, it goes back and does no harm to us." 

One of the wonders of these islands is that they have a woman 
for their ruler, viz., KHadijah, daughter of Sultan Jalal-ud-din 
t Umar, son of Sultan Salah-ud-din Salih-ul- 
queen Bangali 36 The kingship belonged at first to 

her grandfather, then to her father, and when he 
died, her brother Shahab-ud-din became king. He was a minor, 
and the vazlr, ‘ Abd-ul-lah, son of Muhammad-ul-Hazramy 37 mar- 
ried the prince's mother, and gained control over him. The same 
man later married Sultanah KHadijah on the death of her first 
husband, the vazlr Jamal-ud-dln, as we shall see. When Shahab- 
ud-din came of age, he drove out his step-father, the vazlr ‘ Abd-ul- 
lah, and exiled him to the islands of Suwaid. He remained sole 
master, chose a freedman named £ All Kalky as Vazlr whom he dis- 
missed at the end of three years and exiled to Suwaid. Shahab-ud- 
din, however, was a libertine who went out every night to meet the 
wives of his officers and courtiers, and so he was deposed and de- 
ported to the region of Haldatany, where he was put to death soon 
after. 

The only survivors of the royal family were the sisters of the 
late monarch, KHadijah, the eldest, Miriam and Fatimah. The 
people raised to the throne KHadijah, who was married to their 
preacher J amal-ud-dln who become vazlr and real master of the 
state, and promoted his son Muhammad to the place of preacher, 
vacated by him ; but orders are issued only in the name of 
KHadijah. They write these on palm leaves with a curved iron 
tool resembling a knife. They write on paper only copies of the 
Quran and scientific treatises. The preacher mentions the Sul- 
tanah in the prayers on Fridays and other days in these terms. 
“My god, succour thy servant whom thou in thy knowledge hast 
preferred over other mortals, and whom thou hast made the instru-

ment of thy grace towards all Mussulmans, that is to say, the 
Sultanah KHadljah, daughter of the Sultan Jalal-ud-dln, son of 
Sultan Salah-ud-dm.” 

When a stranger arrives among these people and visits the hall 
of audience, called dar, custom requires that he should take two 
cloths with him. He makes an obeisance to the Sul- 
tanah, and throws down one of the two cloths ; then HALL 0F 
he salutes her vazlr, who is also her husband, audience 
Jamal-ud-din, and throws down the second cloth. . 

The army of this Sultanah comprises a thousand foreigners, though 
some of the soldiers are natives. They come every day to the hall of 
audience, salute her, and go back. Their pay consists of rice which 
is supplied to them every month at the bandar . At the end of the 
month, they come to the hall of audience, salute the vazir, and 
tell him : “ Convey our homages to the sovereign and inform her 
that we have come to ask for our pay ” ; thereupon the necessary 
orders are issued. The Qazi and the officials, who bear the title 
* vazirs’ in this country, also present themselves every day in the 
audience hall. They make an obeisance and depart after the 
eunuchs have transmitted their homage to the sovereign. 

The people of the Maldives call the supreme vazlr, lieutenant 
of the Sultanah, Kalky ; and the Qazi, Fandayarqalwa. All sen- 
tences proceed from Qazi, who is treated with greater respect 
than all the other officials, and whose orders are carried out like 
those of the Sultan, or even better. He sits on a 
carpet in the court hall ; he receives the officers 
income from three islands for his own use, 
in accordance with an old custom established by Sultan Ahmad 
Shinurazah. The preacher is called Handljary, the chief of the 
treasury Fdmalddry, the receiver-general of finances Mdfdkalwd, 
the Magistrate of police Fatndyak and the admiral Mdndyak . All 
these persons have the title of vazlr. There is no prison in these 
islands ; culprits are shut up in wooden houses meant for the 
storage of merchandise, each being confined in a wooden cell like 
the Christian prisoners of Morocco. 

When I arrived in this country, I disembarked on the island 
of Kannalus, a fine island with many mosques. I put up in the 
house of one of the most pious inhabitants. The theologian 4 Aly 
gave me a feast ; he was a distinguished 
man ; he had sons who devoted themselves kannalus 
to study. I met a man called Muhammad, 
native of Zafar-ul-Humuz, who entertained me and told me : 4 If

you enter the island of Mahal, the vazir will detain you by force, 
for the people have no Qazl there/ Now my plan was to go from 
there to Ma’bar (Coromandel coast), Sarandib (Ceylon) and 
Bengal, and thence to Sin (China) . I came to the Maldives in a 
vessel of the captain ‘ Umar-ul-hanaury who was among the 
virtuous pilgrims. We spent six days at Kannalus ; then he engag- 
ed a small boat for going to the isle of Mahal with a present to the 
sovereign and her husband. I wished to go with him, but he said' : 
‘The boat is not large enough to take you and your companions ; 
if you will come without them, you may do so/ I declined this 
offer, and ’Umar went away. But the wind was against him, and 
after four days, he returned much fatigued. He made excuses to 
me, and entreated me to accompany him with my companions. 

We set sail in the morning and reached 
taim some island by midday ; we sailed thence and 

spent the night on another island. After sailing 
for four days, we reached the region of Taim, where Hilal 
was governor. He saluted me, gave me a feast, and then came to 
see me with four men, two of whom carried on their shoulders a 
pole from which four chickens were suspended, while the two 
others carried similar poles with about ten cocoanuts tied to them. 
I was surprised at the value they set on these miserable objects, 
but I learned that they acted like this out of consideration and 
regard. 

We left these people, and disembarked on the sixth day in 
the island of Usman, a great and good man. He received us with 
honour and entertained us suitably. On the eighth day we put 
into port in an island belonging to the vazir Talamdy. At last on 
the tenth day we came to the Mahal island where the Sultanah 
and her husband dwelt, and we entered the 
mahal port. It is the rule here that no one is 

allowed to disembark without the permission 
of the inhabitants. They gave us permission, and I wished to go 
to some mosque ; but the slaves who were on the shore stopped 
me saying that it was essential to visit the vazir. I had enjoined 
the captain to plead ignorance if he was questioned about me ; 
this I did lest they should detain me; for I did not know that an 
ill-advised gossip had written to them about me that I had been 
Qazl at Delhi. When we reached the court hall, we sat on the 
benches placed near the third door from the entrance. The Qazl, 

‘ Isa-ul- Y emeny , turned up and saluted me. On my side I saluted 
the vazir. The captain of the ship Ibrahim (called c Umar else- 
where) brought ten pieces of cloth, made a salute to the sovereign

and threw down one of these cloths; then he bent his knee in 
honour of the vazir and threw down another cloth, and so on to the 
last. They asked him about me, and he said T do not know him. 5 

Then they gave us betel and rosewater, a mark of honour 
among these people. The vazir put us up in a house, and sent us 
food consisting of a large basinful of rice and 
other plates of meat salted and dried in the reception 
sun, chickens, ghee and fish. The next day 
I went with the captain of the ship and the Qazi ‘ Isa-ul-Ye~ 
meny to visit a hermitage founded at the extremity of the island 
by the virtuous Shaikh Najib. We returned by night, and the 
next morning the vazir sent me a robe and meal comprising the 
same items as before, and cocoanuts and honey extracted from 
them which the islanders called qurbdny , c sugar water’. They 
brought also 100,000 cowries for my expenses. At the end of ten 
days, there came a vessel from Ceylon which carried Arab and 
Persian fakirs who knew me and who told the servants of the 
vazir all about me ; this greatly increased the joy he experienced 
at my arrival. He sent for me at the commencement of the 
Ramzan. I found the chiefs and the vazir already gathered there, 
and food was being served on tables each taken up by a number 
of friends. The grand vazir seated me by his side along with the 
Qazi c Isa, the vazir Famaldari or chief of the treasury, and the 
vazir 1 Umar dahard , i.e the general of the army. The meal of 
these islanders consists of rice, chicken, ghee, fish and flesh salted 
and dried in the sun, and cooked banana. After food they drink 
the wine of cocoanut palm mixed with spices for promoting diges- 
tion. On the ninth day of Ramzan, the son-in-law of the vazir 
died. His wife, the daughter of this minister, had already been 
married to Sultan Shahab-ud-din, but neither of her husbands had 
lived with her on account of her tender age. The vazir, her father, 
took her back into his house and gave me her 
house which was one of the best. I asked fakirs 
for permission to entertain the fakirs who had re- entertained 
turned after a pilgrimage to the Foot of Adam in the 
island of Ceylon. He gave me the permission and sent me five 
sheep, rare animals on these islands, as they are imported from 
Ma’bar, Malabar, and Maqdashu. Hie vazir sent me also rice, 
chicken, ghee and spices. I had all these things carried to the 
house of vazir Sulaiman, the Mdnayak (admiral) , who added more 
to them and had them cooked with the greatest care and also sent 
me carpets and brass vessels. We broke the fast, according to 
custom, in the palace of the Sultanah, with the grand vazir, and I 
begged him to allow some of the vazirs to assist me at my feast.

He told me that he would himself come there, and I thanked him 
duly and came back to my house; but he had already come with 
the vazlrs and the magnates of the court. He was seated in a high 
wooden pavilion. All who came, chiefs or vazlrs, saluted the 
grand vazlr and threw before him a piece of unsewn cloth, so that 
the total of such cloths was nearly a hundred, and these the fakirs 
took. The food was then served and eaten ; then the readers of 
the Quran gave a reading with their fine voices after which they 
began to chant and dance. I had a fire made, and the fakirs en- 
tered it and trod upon it with their feet ; some among them swal- 
lowed burning charcoal as one eats sweets, till the flame died out. 

When the night came to an end the vazir returned, and I ac- 
companied him. We passed by a garden belonging to the trea- 
sury and the vazxr said to me : c This garden 
siave girls is yours; I shall have a house built there 
for you to live in. 9 1 praised his action and 
prayed for his welfare. The next day he sent me a slave-girl 
and his messenger told me : 1 The vazir wants me to tell you that 
if this girl pleases you, she is yours ; else he will send you a 
Mahratha girl. 9 I like Mahratha girls, and so I replied to the mes- 
senger : 4 1 want only Mahrathas. 9 The minister had one sent to 
me by name Gulistan which means, 4 flower of the garden, 9 (or, 
more exactly, ‘flower-garden. 9 ) She knew Persian and pleased 
me very much. The people of Maidive islands speak a language 
I cannot understand. 

The next day the vazir sent me a young slave-girl from Coro- 
mandel, called ‘ Anbari (colour of ambergris) i.e., black. The 
following night, after prayer, he came to my house with some of 
his servants, and entered it with two small slaves. I saluted him 
and he asked me how I fared. I prayed for his happiness and 
thanked him. One of the slaves placed before him a luqshdh 
( buqshah ) i.e., a kind of leather bag, from which he took out silk 
cloths and a casket containing pearls and jewels. The vazir pre- 
sented them to me, and added : “ If I had sent you this with the 

slave-girl, she might have said — ‘ this is my property, I brought 
from my master’s house. 9 Now these things belong to you and 
you may present them to her. 99 I prayed to God for the minister's 
good and rendered thanks to him as he deserved. 

The vazir Sulaiman, the Mdnayak, proposed that I should 
marry his daughter ; I sent to ask of the vazir Jamal-ud-din per- 
mission to contract this marriage. My messenger returned and 
said : “ This proposal is not to his liking as he wants you to marry

his daughter when the legal period of her widowhood comes to 
an end.” I refused to. agree to this union out of fear for the had 
luck attaching to the daughter of the grand vazir as both her hus- 
bands had died before consummating their marriage with her. 
Meanwhile, I fell ill and had a bad fever ; 
for every one who enters' these islands invaria- 
bly catches fever. I took a firm resolve to prevented 
leave the country ; I sold a part of my jewels for cowries and en- 
gaged a vessel for sailing to Bengal. When I went to 

take leave of the vazir, the Qizi came to meet me and 
said in the name of the vazir : ‘ If you wish to go, 

give back to us what we have given you, and then go.’ I 
answered, ‘With some of the jewels I have bought cowries, you 
may do what you like with them.’ After some time the Qazi re- 
turned ; * the vazir,’ he reported, ‘ says we gave you gold and not 
cowries.’ ‘Very well,’ said I, ‘I shall sell them and return your 
gold.’ As a result, I sent asking' the merchants to buy the cowries 
from me, but the vazir ordered them not to do so ; for he meant 
thus to prevent my departure from his country. Afterwards he 
sent me one of his friends to say : ‘ The vazir wants me to tell you 
that if you stay with us you will have all you want.’ I said to my- 
self : “ I am in their power ; if I will not stay with good grace, I 
shall have to do so by constraint; a voluntary stay is much the 
better.” And I told the messenger : ‘ Very well, I shall stay with 
him.’ He returned to his master who was greatly pleased at my 
answer, and sent for me. When I entered his house, he got up, 
embraced me and said : ‘ We wish you to he near us, and you wish 
to go away!’ I made my excuses to him which he accepted, and I 
told him: ‘If you wish me to stay, I shall make conditions.’ The 
vazir replied, ‘ state them and we shall accept.’ I said : ‘ I cannot 
walk on foot.’ Now it is the custom of the country that no one 
rides a horse unless he be a vazir. When they gave me a horse 
and I rode on it, the people, men and children, began to follow me 
in amazement, till at last I had to complain of it to the vazir. 
He caused it to be proclaimed by beat of danqurah that no one 
should follow me ; the danqurah is a kind of brass basin which is 
beaten with an iron rod and is heard far; after heating it, they 
proclaim in public what they want. 

The vazir told me : ‘If you would ride in a palanquin, it 

would he very good ; else, we have a horse and a mare ; choose 
whichever you like.’ I chose the mare, and they brought her to 
me at once, along with a robe. I asked the vazir : ‘ what shall I 
do with the cowries I have bought ?’ He replied : ‘ Bend one of

your companions to sell them in Bengal’ ‘ I shall do so,’ said I, 
* if you will send some one to assist him in the work.’ ‘ Yes/ he 
replied. I then sent my companion, Abu Muhammad, son of 
Farhan, with whom they sent a man named the pilgrim ‘Aly . 38 
Now the sea was rough, and the crew threw overboard all the 
cargo including the mast, the water and all other provisions meant 
for the journey. For sixteen days they were without sail or rudder, 
and after having endured hunger and thirst and fatigues, they 
reached the island of Ceylon. At the end of a year, my companion 
Abu Muhammad returned to me after visiting the Foot (of Adam) . 

At the end of the month of Ramzan, the vazir sent me a robe, 
and we went to the place set apart for prayers. The way from 
the minister’s house to this place was decorated ; cloth was spread 
(on the ground) and heaps of cowries placed to the right and left. 
All those among the amirs and nobles who owned houses on the 
way had caused small cocoanut palms to be planted near them to- 
gether with areca palms and bananas. Ropes had been stretched 
from tree to tree and green cocoanuts suspended from them. The 
master of the house stood near the door and, when the vazir pass- 
ed, threw at his feet a cloth of silk or cotton. The slaves of the 
minister picked them up as well as the cowries placed on his route. 
The vazir walked on foot, wearing an ample robe of wool, of 
Egyptian make, and a large turban. He wore a silk napkin as his 
scarf; four parasols sheltered his head, and there were sandals on 
his feet. All the others, without exception, had bare feet. Trum- 
pets, clarions and kettle-drums preceded him ; the soldiers march- 
ed before and after him crying : * God is great/ till they reached 
the place of prayer. 

When prayer was finished, the vazlr’s son preached; then they 
brought a litter and the minister got into it. The amirs and the 
other vazlrs saluted him and threw pieces of cloth according to 
custom. In former times the grand vazir never went in a litter 
and only the kings did so. The litter was then lifted by porters, 
I mounted my horse, and we went to the palace. The minister 
sat on a raised seat, and there were vazlrs and amirs near him. 

. The slaves were standing with shields, swords and batons in their 
hands. Then they served food, and afterwards arecanut and 
betel ; then they brought a small bowl containing sandal maqdsary . 
As soon as a party finish their dinner, they smear themselves with 
sandal. That day I saw over some of their food a fish of a species 
of Sardine, salted and uncooked, which had been sent to them as

a present from Kulam (Quilon) . This fish is plentiful on the 
Malabar coast, the vazir took a sardine and started eating it, saying 
to me at the same time ; 'eat this, it is not found in our country/ I 
replied : ‘ how shall I eat it ; it is not cooked/ t It is cooked/ he 
answered ; but I replied : * I know this fish well, for it abounds in 
my country/ 

Of my marriage and my nomination as Qdzi 

On the second day of Shawwdl, I agreed with the vazir Sulai- 
man Mdndyak or 'admiral, that I would marry his daughter ; and 
I sent to ask of vazir Jamal-ud-dln that the marriage should take 
place in his presence, in the palace. He agreed to this, and sent 
betel and sandal according to custom. People were ready for the 
ceremony, but the vazir Sulaiman delayed ; they sent for him, but 
still he did not come. He was sent for a second time, and he ex- 
cused himself on the score of the illness of his daughter. But the 
grand vazir told me in private : “ His daughter has refused to 
marry, and she is the mistress of her own actions. There are the 
people assembled, and how do you like marrying the step-mother 
of the Sultanah?” (The son of the grand vazir had married the 
daughter of this woman) . I replied : c< O! certainly.” He sum- 
moned the Qazi and the notaries. The profession of Mussulman 
faith was recited, and the vazir gave the nuptial gift. After a few 
days, she was brought to me. She was one of the best of women. 
Such was the excellence of her manners, that when I became her 
husband, she anointed me with good scents and perfumed my 
garments ; laughing all the while and showing no signs of incon- 
venience to her. 

After I married this woman, the vazir forced me to accept the 
functions of Qazi. The reason for my nomination was that I had 
reproached the Qazi for his taking the tenth part of all inheritances 
when he divided them among the parties entitled to them. I told 
him: “ You should take only a fee fixed with the consent of the 
heirs.” And this judge did nothing properly. When I took up 
the functions of judge, I spent all my efforts to enforce the precepts 
of the law. The law-suits do not take place there as in our country. 
The first bad custom that I reformed related to the stay of di- 
vorced women in the house of those who had repudiated them; 
for each of these women continued to live in the house of her 
former husband, till she married another. I prevented their doing 
this on any account. About twenty-five men who had behaved 
like this were brought to me; I had them whipped and paraded in 
the market place ; and as for the women, I forced them to leave 


264 FOREIGN NOTICES 

the houses of these men. Afterwards, 1 strove to secure the strict 
observance of the prayers, and ordered the men to go quickly in 
the streets and bazaars immediately after the Friday prayer. Any- 
one who was discovered not having prayed, I had beaten and parad- 
ed in public. I compelled the imams and mu’zzins holding fixed 
appointments to perform their duties assiduously ; 1 wrote in the 
same sense to the magistrates of all the islands. Lastly, I tried to 
make the women wear clothes ; but I did not succeed in this. 

On the arrival of vazir c Abd-ul-lah, son of Muhammad ul- 
Hazramy , whom the Sultan Shahab-ud-din had exiled to Sawaid ; 
narrative of what passed betioeen us : 

I had espoused the step-daughter of this man, the 
daughter of his wife, and I loved her greatly. When the 
grand vazir recalled him to the isle of Mahal, I sent him 
presents, went to meet him and accompanied him to the 
palace. He saluted the supreme vazir who lodged him in 
a superb mansion where I visited him often. It happened that I 
spent the month of Ramzan in prayers, and all people visited me 
except ‘Abd-ul-lah. The vazir Jamal-ud-dm himself came to see 
me, and 4 Abd-ul-lah with him, to bear him company. An enmity 
arose between us. For when I came out of the retreat, the mater- 
nal uncles of my wife, the step-daughter of ‘Abd-ul-lah, complain- 
ed to me. They were the sons of the vazir Jamal-ud-dm ul-Sanjary. 
Their father had named vazir ‘Abd-ul-lah as their guardian, and 
their properties were still in his hands, though, according to law, 
they had come out of his tutelage. They demanded Ms appearance 
before the tribunal. I had a rule, when I summoned one of the 
opposing parties of sending him a piece of paper with or without 
writing. As soon as they knew of it, they came to the tribunal ; 
or else I punished them. I sent then a paper to ‘Abd-ul-lah as 
usual with me. This procedure made him very angry, and because 
of it he conceived a hatred against me. He concealed his enmity, 
and asked some one to speak in his place. Dishonest statements 
were repeated to me as having been made by him. 

The custom of the islanders, weak or strong, was to salute the 
vazir ‘Abd-ul-lah in the same manner as the vazir Jamal-ud-dm. 
Their salutation consists in touching the ground with the fore- 
finger, and then kissing the finger and placing it on the head. I 
gave order to the public crier, and he proclaimed it in the palace 
of the sovereign, in the presence of witnesses, that all persons who 
rendered homage to vazir ‘Abd-ul-lah in the same way as to the 
grand vazir would incur severe punishment. I required him to 



IBN BATTUTA 


265 


bind Himself no more to allow people to do this. His enmity to 
me was aggravated by this. Meanwhile, I married yet another 
wife, daughter of a vazir, much respected by the islanders, and a 
descendant of Sultan Baud, grandson of Sultan Ahmad Shinura- 
zah ; then I married another who had been married to Sultan 
Shahab-ud-din, and I had three mansions constructed in the gar- 
den given to me by the vazir. As to my fourth wife, who was 
the step-daughter of the vazir ‘Abd-ul-lah she lived in her own 
house. She was the best loved of them all When I had contract- 
ed these marriages, the vazir and the people of the island began 
to fear me much, because of their weakness. False rumours were 
carried to me and to the chief vazir, largely owing to the exertions 
of vazir ‘Abd-ul-lah, so that a definite estrangement came between 
us. 

On my separation from these persons and the motive of it 

One day it happened that the wife of a slave of the late Sul- 
tan Jamal-ud-dln complained about him to the vazir, telling him 
that the slave was found having adulterous intercourse with a 
concubine of the Sultan. The vazir sent witnesses who entered 
the house of the young man, found the slave sleeping with her on 
the same carpet, and imprisoned them. Next morning I heard the 
news, and went to the hall of audience, and took my seat as usual 
I did not say a word about this affair. A courtesan came near me 
and said: “The vazir sent me to ask you if you need anything.” 
I replied : “ No. ” The idea of the minister was that I should speak 
of the affair of the concubine and the slave; for it was my rule 
that no case came before me without my judging it. But as I 
disliked and hated him, I omitted to do this. I then returned to my 
house, and sat in the place where I pronounced my sentences. 
Forthwith there came a vazir, who told me, on behalf of the grand 
vazir: “ Yesterday such and such a thing happened on account 
of the affair of the concubine and the slave ; deal with them as the 
law requires.” I answered : “ This is a case in which it is not 
proper to pronounce judgement outside the Sultan’s palace.” Then 
I went back there, the people assembled, and the concubine and 
the slave were summoned. I ordered both to be beaten on ac- 
count of their tete~&-tete, and caused the woman to be set free and 
the slave to be imprisoned ; after this, I returned to my house. 

The vazir sent me several of his principal servants to ask me 
to set the slave free. I told them: “You intercede with me in 
favour of a negro slave who has violated the honour of his master, 
and but yesterday, you yourselves deposed the Sultan Shahab-ud-

dm and killed him, because he had entered the house of one of 
his slaves !’ 1 9 And at once I ordered the culprit to be beaten with 
bamboo sticks (which have greater c^ffect than whipping) and 
paraded through all the island with a cord round his neck. The 
messengers of the vazir went and told him what happened. He 
showed great excitement and was roused to great anger. He as- 
sembled the other vazxrs and commanders of the army, and sent 
for me. I went, and, without making the usual salutation, bend- 
ing my knee, I just said : e Salutation to you.’ Then I said to 
those present : “ Be my witnesses, that I resign the functions of QazI 
because of my inability to perform them.” The vazir having ad- 
dressed me, I mounted (the dais) and seated myself in a place 
where I was face to face with him ; then I answered in the firmest 
possible manner. Meanwhile the mu’zzin called for the sunset 
prayer, and the grand vazir entered his house saying : “ It is said 
that I am sovereign ; now I summoned this man in order to vent 
my anger on him, and he vented his on me.” The islanders show- 
ed me respect only because of the Sultan of India, for they know 
the esteem in which he holds me ; and though they are at a great 
distance from him, there is great fear of him in their hearts. 

When the grand vazir entered his house, he sent for the QazI 
who had been removed from office. He was eloquent and address- 
ed me as follows : “ Our master asks why, in the presence of 
witnesses, you failed to show him the respect that was his due, and 
why you did not render him homage”; I answered: “I saluted him 
only when my heart was satisfied with him ; but as I am now dis- 
satisfied, I have given up doing so. The salutation of Muslims 
consists only in the word saldm , and this I said.” The vazir sent 
this man a second time to me when he said : “ Your object is just 
to leave us ; pay the dowries of your wives and what you owe to 
the men, and then go if you will.” On hearing this, I bowed, went 
to my house, and cleared the debts I had contracted. In those 
days the vazir had given me carpets, and other personal property 
comprising copper vessels and other objects. In fact he gave me 
everything I asked for, loved me and treated me with considera- 
tion ; but he changed his mind, and had his fears roused regarding 
me. 

When he heard that I had paid my debts and was preparing 
to go, he repented of what he had said, and put off giving me per- 
mission for my departure. I swore the most solemn oaths that it 
was absolutely essential for me to resume my voyage, and carried 
whatever I had to a mosque on the sea-coast, and divorced one of 
my wives. Another was with child, and I fixed a term of nine

267 


months for her within which 1 was to come back ; if I defaulted, 
she would be free to act as she liked. I took with me the wife that 
had formerly been married to Sultan Shahab-ud-din in order to 
restore her to her father who lived in Muluk island, and my first 
wife whose daughter was the consanguineous sister of the Sultanah. 

I made a compact with the vazir * Umar dahard (or general of 
the army), and the vazir Hasan, admiral, that I should go to the 
country of Ma’bar (Coromandel), the king of which was my 
brother-in-law, 39 and return from there with troops to bring the 
islands under his power, and that afterwards 1 should exercise autho- 
rity in his name. I arranged that the hoisting of white flags on the 
ships was to serve as the signal between them and me; the moment 
they saw these, they were to rise in revolt on the island, I had never 
aimed at this till the day of my estrangement from the vazir. He 
dreaded me and told the people : “ Quite sure, this man will seize 
the vazirate either in my life time or after my death.” He used to 
ask many questions concerning me, and said : “ I have heard that 

the king of India has sent him money to enable him to stir up 
trouble against me.” He feared my departure, lest I should return 
with troops from the Coromandel coast. He sent word to me to 
wait till he could fit out a ship for me, but I refused. 

The consanguineous sister of the Sultanah complained to her of 
the departure of her mother with me. The Sultanah wished to stop 
this, but could not do so. When she found her resolved to leave, 
she told her : “ All the jewels yon had were made from the money 
belonging to the customs house. If you have evidence to show that 
Jalal-ud-din gave them to you, well and good; else, return them.” 
These jewels were of great value ; nevertheless, my wife gave 
them back. The vazlrs and chiefs came to me while I was in the 
mosque, and begged me to return. I answered them : “ If I had 
not sworn, certainly, I should return.” They rejoined : “ Go then 
to some other island that you may keep your oath, and then come 
back,” to which I agreed in order to please them. When the day 
of my departure came, I went to bid farewell to the' vazir. He 
embraced me and wept so much that his tears fell on my feet. He 
spent the following night guarding the island himself out of fear 
that my relatives by marriage and my friends would rise against 
him. 

At last I left the island and reached that of the vazir ‘Aly. My 
wife was attacked by a severe pain, and she wanted to go "back. I

divorced her and left her there, and I wrote about this to the 
vazir, for she was the mother of his son’s wife. I also divorced the 
wife for whom I had fixed a term (for my return) and I sent for a 
young slave whom I loved. Meanwhile we continued the voyage 
in the midst of these islands, passing one district after another. 

Of the women who have only one breast : 

In one of these isles, I saw a woman who had only one breast. 
She was the mother of two daughters, one of these resembling her 
completely, and the other had two breasts, one large and containing 
milk, while the other was small and had no milk. I was surprised 
by the form of these women. 

Then we reached another of these islands, a small island with 
only one house in it, occupied by a weaver, who was married and 
father of a family. He had small cocoanut palms and a small boat 
which he used for fishing and for going to any of the islands at his 
pleasure. On his islet there were also some small bananas ; we 
found no land birds there except two crows which flew towards us 
when we came and made a circle above our vessel I really envied 
this man, and wished that his island had been mine, for me to retire 
in it and await the inevitable end of my time. 

Then I came to the island of Muluk, where a ship belonging to 
Captain Ibrahim was lying. I resolved to go in this ship to the 
Coromandel coast. This man visited me with 
MXJL ^ K his companions, and they entertained me at a 

fine feast. The vazir had written to the effect 
that I was to be given in this island one hundred and 
twenty bustu of cowries, and twenty goblets of cocoanut-palm-wine, 
and each day a certain amount of betel, areca-nut and fish. I spent 
seventy days in Muluk, and married two wives. Muluk is among 
the most beautiful islands, verdant and fertile. Among the marvels 
of the island, I noticed that a branch cut from any tree and planted 
on the earth or on a wall, soon became covered with leaves and 
grew into a tree. I saw also that the pomegranate bore fruit 
throughout the year. The people of the island feared that Captain 
Ibrahim might plunder them at the time of his departure. As a 
result they wished to seize all the weapons on his ship and keep 
them till the day of his departure. A dispute arose on this account, 
and we returned to Mahal where we did not land. I wrote to 
the vazir to tell him what had happened. He sent a letter to the 
effect that it was not right to have seized the arms of the crew. 
We then returned to Muluk, and again set sail from there in the

middle of the month of Rabi’ II of the year 745 40 (26th August 
1344) . In the month of Sha’ban of the same year (December, 
1344), the vazir Jamal-ud-din died. The Sultanah was pregnant, 
and was delivered after his death. The vazir ’Abd-ul-lah married 
her. As for us, we sailed without a trained pilot in our midst ; 
and though the distance between the Maldives and the Coro- 
mandel is just three days' journey, we sailed 
for nine days and landed on the island of ceylon 
Silan (Ceylon) on the ninth day. We saw 
there the mountain of Sarandlb 41 rising In the air like a column, of 
smoke. When we approached this island, the sailors said : “ This 

port Is not in the country of a Sultan whose lands merchants 
might enter in full security ; but it lies in the territory of 
Sultan Airy Shakrauty (Arya Cakravarti) who is a perverse 
and unjust man, and owns a pirate fleet.” Hence we were afraid 
to land in his port ; but a high wind arose, and we dreaded the sink- 
ing of the ship. And I told the captain : “ Get me ashore, and I 
shall get for you a safe-conduct from this Sultan.” He acted 
accordingly and put me ashore. The idolaters came to us and 
asked: “Who are you?” I told them that I was the 

brother-in-law and friend of the Sultan of Ma’bar, that I 
had set out to visit him, and that what was on board the vessel was 
a present meant for this prince. They went to their sovereign and 
conveyed my answer to him. He sent for me and I went to see 
him in the town of Battalah (Puttelam) , his capital. It is a small 
and pretty place, surrounded by a wall and bastions of wood. The 
whole coast in the neighbourhood is covered with trunks of 
cinnamon trees washed down by the torrents. These trees are 
heaped on the shore and look like a sort of hillocks there. The 
people of Ma’bar (Coromandel) and Malabar take them without 
paying anything ; in return for this favour, however, they make 
presents to the Sultan of cloth and similar things. Between the 
Ma’bar and the island of Ceylon, it Is a day and a night’s journey. 
We also find on this island much brazil wood as well as Indian aloe, 
which is called alkalkhy (probably the Greek agallokon ), but has 
no resemblance to Qamary or Qdquly. We shall speak of this later. 

The Sultan of Silan is called Airy Shakrauty; and he is power- 
ful on the sea. Once, when I was on the Ma’bar Coast, I saw a

hundred vessels of his, great and small, which came 
the sultan there. There were in the port eight ships belonging 

of ceylon to the Sultan of the country reserved for a voyage 

to Yemen. The king ordered preparations to be 
made and appointed the persons to guard his vessels. When the 
Ceylonese despaired of finding an occasion to seize them, they said : 
“ We have come only to protect our vessels which have also to go 
to Yemen/ 5 

When I entered the house of the infidel Sultan, he rose, made 
me sit by his side and spoke to me with the utmost kindness. He 
told me: “Your companions may land in all security; they will be 
my guests till their departure. The Sultan of Ma’bar coast and I 
are friends. 35 Then he arranged for my lodging, and I spent three 
days with him, treated with great consideration, which increased 
every day. He understood Persian and enjoyed greatly what 1 
related to him regarding foreign kings and their lands. One day 
I went to him when he had near him a quantity of pearls, brought 
to him from the fisheries in his country. His officers separated the 
valuable ones from the rest. He asked me: “Have you seen pearl 
fisheries in the countries you have travelled in? 35 “Yes, 33 1 replied 
“ 1 have seen them in the islands of Qais and Kish that belong to 
Ibn Sawwamaly. 55 “I have heard of them, 53 he said, and then gave 
me many pearls and added: “Are there pearls equal to these in 
that island? 35 I replied: “I have seen only inferior pearls there. 55 
My answer pleased him, and he said: “The pearls are yours. 55 “Do 
not blush !/ 5 he added, “ask for whatever you want. 55 I then said: 
“I have had no other desire, since coming to this island, than to 
visit the celebrated Foot of Adam. 55 The people of the country call 
Adam, Bdha, and Hava, Mama. “ That is easy 55 he replied, “ I shall 
send some one with you to take you there. 55 “ That is what I want/ 5 
said I, and then added: “ The ship in which I came can proceed to 
Ma’bar in all safety, and when I come back, you will send me in 
your vessels. 55 “ Certainly/ 5 he said. 

When I reported this to the Captain of the ship, he said to me: 
“ I will not go till you come back, though I have to wait a year on 
your account. 55 I informed the Sultan of this reply, and he said to 
me: “ The captain will be my guest till your return.” 

The Sultan then gave me a palanquin which his slaves carried 
on their shoulders, and sent with me four of the yogis who have 
the custom of undertaking an annual pilgrimage

adam's peak among his companions, and fifteen men for carrying

along the route. On the first day, we camped near a river, which 
we crossed by a ferry made of bamboos. From there we travelled 
to Manar Mandaly, a fine town at the extremity of the Sultan’s 
territory ; the people there treated us to a great feast. The repast 
comprised young buffalos, captured in a hunt in the adjoining 
wood, and brought home alive, of rice, ghi, fish, fowl and milk. We 
did not find any Muslim in this town, with the exception of a 
KHurasanian who remained there for reasons of health and who 
accompanied us. We left for Bandar Salawat, a small town, and 
passed through a rough country with many water courses in it. 
There are many elephants, but they do no harm to pilgrims and 
strangers, and this is due to the holy influence of Shaikh Abu ’Abd- 
ul-lah, son of the KHafif, the first to open the road for visiting the 
Foot. Formerly the infidels stopped the Mussulmans from making 
this pilgrimage, annoyed them, and neither ate nor traded with 
them. But since the adventure that befel Shaikh Abu ? Abd-ul~lah 
as has been narrated above , 42 they began to honour the 
Muslims, allowing them to enter their houses and eat with them. 
They even trust them with their wives and children. To this day 
they do great honour to the Shaikh and call him 4 the great Shaikh \ 

Then we went to the town of Kunkar, the residence of the 
principal sovereign of this country. It is built in a valley between 
two mountains near a large bay, called the bay of precious stones, 
because gems are found in it. Outside this 
town, there is the mosque of Shaikh ‘Usman kunxah 
of Shiraz, sumamed Shawush (the usher) ; the 
sovereign and the inhabitants of the place visit it and show their 
regard for him. It was he that served as guide to the Foot, and 
when he had one of his hands and feet cut off, his sons and slaves 
became guides in his place. He was thus mutilated because of his 
having killed a cow. Now the law of the Hindus ordains that who- 
ever kills a cow should be slaughtered in the same manner, or 
packed in her skin and burned. As Shaikh ‘Usman was respected 
by the people, they stopped with cutting off his hand and foot, and 
made him a present of the revenue raised in a certain bazaar. 


42. ii 80-1. Ibn Battuta’s story is that the Shaikh once went to Adam’s 
Peak with about thirty dervishes who, while journeying in this part of 
Ceylon, felt the pangs of hunger, caught hold of a young elephant and ate 
it, in spite of the Shaikh’s warning. That night the elephants mustered strong 
and killed all the dervishes who had eaten of the elephant’s flesh, sparing 
only the Shaikh who had refrained, and was carried by an elephant on its 
back. — See Gibb pp. 95-6,

The Sultan of Kunkar is called Kunar, 42a and he has a white

He himself continues to live in that town, a blind man. 

The admirable gems called the bahramdn (rubies or carbuncles) 
are to be seen only in this town. Among them, some are taken 
from the bay, and these are the most precious In 
precious stones the eyes of the natives ; others are taken out 
of the earth. We find gems in all places in 
the island of Silan. In this land, the entire soil is private 
property. When a person buys a piece of land, he digs it for gems. 
He comes across white and ramified stones, and inside these stones 
gems lie hidden. The owner sends them to the lapidaries who 
strike them till they separate the gems from the stone hiding them. 
The gems are red (rubies) , yellow (topazes) , and blue (sapphires) 
or nilam as they call it. The custom of the people is to reserve for 
the Sultan all precious stones of the value of a hundred fanams or 
more; the Sultan pays the price and takes them for himself. Stones 
of a lower value are retained by those who find them. A hundred 
fanams are equal to six gold pieces. 

All the women of Ceylon have necklaces of precious stones of 
divers colours, and they have likewise bracelets on their hands 
and l&alakhail (anklets) on their feet. The Sultan’s women make 
networks out of these gems for their head. I saw on the forehead of 
the white elephant seven of these gems, each bigger than a hen’s egg. 
I have also seen near the Sultan Airy Shakrauty (Arya Cakravarti) 
a bowl of rubies of the size of the palm of the hand and containing 
the oil of aloes. When I expressed my surprise at this bowl, the 
Sultan said to me: “ We have even larger articles made of the same 
material.” 

We left Kunkar and stopped at a cave called after Usta 
Muhammad Allury. He was a good man; he dug out this cave on 
the slope of the mountain, near a small bay. Leav- 
black ing this cave, we went on, and encamped near 

monkeys the bay called Khaur buznah (the bay of the mon- 

keys). Buznah (Pers. Buzinah) is the same as 
the qurd (pi. of qird, monkey) in Arabic. Monkeys are very numer- 
ous on these mountains; they are black in colour, and have long 


42a. Konar, as in Alagakkonar,

tails. Those of the male sex have beards like men. Shaikh 'Usman, 
his son and other persons told me that these monkeys have a chief 
whom they obey as if he were a king. He wears on his forehead 
a fillet of leaves and leans upon a staff. Four monkeys, staves in 
hand, march on his right and left, and when the chief is seated, 
they stand behind him. His female and young ones come and sit 
before him every day; the other monkeys come and sit at some 
distance from him; then one of the four monkeys abovementioned 
addresses them, and all the monkeys withdraw; after this, each 
brings a banana or a lemon or some similar fruit. The king of the 
monkeys, his young ones and the four principal monkeys eat. A 
certain yogi told me that he saw these four monkeys beating another 
monkey’ with sticks before their chief and then pulling out his 
hair. 

Trustworthy men have told me that when one of these 
monkeys seizes a young girl, she cannot escape his lewdness. 
An inhabitant of the island of Ceylon narrated to me that 
there was a monkey in his house, and that when one of his 
daughters entered a room, the animal followed her. She raised a 
cry, but the monkey violated her. “We rushed up to her,” he 
continued, “ we saw the monkey holding her in his embrace and 
we killed him.” 

Now we left for the bay of bamboos whence Abu ’Abd-ul-lah, 
son of the KHafif, got the two rubies that he gave to the Sultan of 
this island, as we have stated earlier . 43 Then we travelled to a 
place called “ The house of the Old Woman,” at the extreme limit 
of the inhabited world. Thence we went to the Cave of Baba Tahir, 
who was a good man, and then to the Cave of Sabik, who was a 
Hindu sovereign that retired to this spot for giving himself up to 
devotional practices. 

On the Flying Leech 

In this place we saw the flying leech called zolu by the natives. 
It stays on the trees and herbs near the water, and when a man 
approaches, it rushes on him. Whatever the part of his body on 
which the leech settles, it bleeds profusely. "Hie people keep a 
lemon ready to squeeze out its juice, in such a case, on the worm, 
which then falls away from the body; they then scrape the part of 
the body with a wooden knife kept for the purpose. They said that 
a certain pilgrim passing by this route was fastened on by the 
leeches, and that, as he was slack and did not press citron juice on

them, all his blood was lost and he died. His name was Baba 
KHuzy and there is a cave bearing his name. From this place, we 
proceeded to the seven caverns, and then to the hill of Iskandar 
(Alexander) . Here there was a cave called the Safhany, a water- 
source and an inhabited castle, below which was a bay called 'The 
place of the sinking of the contemplatives.’ In the same spot are 
found the cave of the orange and that of the Sultan. Near this 
last is the entrance (darwazah in Pers., bah in Arab.) to the 
mountain. 


The mountain of Sarandib (Adam's Peak) 

The mountain of Sarandib is among the highest in the 
world; we saw it from the sea when we had still to travel 
nine days to reach it. When we ascended it, we 
the ascent saw clouds below us, hiding its base from our view. 

to the peak On this mountain there are many ever-green trees, 

flowers of many colours and a red rose as 
big as the palm of the hand. They say that on this rose there is an 
inscription of the name of the Almighty God and His Prophet . 433 
On the mountain there are two paths leading to the Foot of Adam, 
called after the father and mother, i.e. Adam and Eve. Eve’s path 
is the easy route by which pilgrims return, and those who take it 
on their way to the Foot would be regarded as not having made the 
pilgrimage. Adam’s path is rough and difficult to climb. At the 
foot of the mountain, near the gate, is a grotto called after Iskandar 
(Alexander), and a spring. 


The ancients have cut on the rock a sort of stairway leading 
up the mountain; they have also planted iron posts from which 
chains are suspended so that those who ascend may hold by them. 
There are ten of these chains, two at the base near the gate, seven 
others in succession after the first two, and, as for the tenth, it is 
the “ Chain of the Profession of Faith ” (Mussulman) , so called be- 
cause a person who reaches it and looks down to the foot of the 
mountain will be seized with hallucination and fear of falling, and 
will recite the words: “ I declare that there is no other god but 
God, and that Muhammad is His Prophet.” When you pass the tenth 
chain, you come to an ill-kept road. From the tenth chain to the 
Cave of KHizr, it is seven miles. This cave is situated in a wide 
area, and near by is a spring also called after KHizr and full of fish 
which no one catches. Near the cave, there are two cisterns cut 
in the rock, one on either side of the path. The pilgrims leave their

belongings in the KHizr grotto, and from there ascend two miles 
further to the summit where the Foot is. 

Description of the Foot 

The notable foot-print of our Father Adam 44 is on a high black 
rock in a roomy place. The foot has sunk in the stone so as to 
leave its imprint as a clear depression in the rock; it is eleven spans 
long. Formerly the people of China came here; they cut from the 
rock the impression of the great toe and the adjoining parts, and 
put it in the temple of Zaitun, which is visited by people from the 
remotest parts of the land. In the rock bearing the imprint of the 
Foot are dug out nine holes in which the infidel pilgrims put gold, 
precious stones and' pearls. You can see the Fakirs, when they 
reach the grotto of KHizr, seeking to race one another to take what 
there is in these holes. For our part, we found only a few small 
stones and a little gold, which we gave to our guide. It is usual for 
pilgrims to pass three days in the grotto of KHizr, and on these days 
to visit the Foot morning and evening. We did it also. 

At the end of the three days, we returned by the mother’s path, 
and encamped near the grotto of Shiam, who is the same as Shait, 
the son of Adam. We then came to the ‘bay of fish/ the towns of 
Kurumlah, Jabarkavan, Dildxnivah and Atqalanjah. It was in the 
town last mentioned that the Shaikh Abu 3 Abd-ul-lah, son of the 
KHafif, passed the winter. All these towns and stations are on the 
mountain. Near its foot, in the same road is found ‘dirakfot-i-ravan* 
‘the walking tree/ an old tree from which not a single leaf falls. I 
have not met anybody who has seen its leaves. It is called ‘walking 5 
because a person who looks at it from the top of the mountain 
thinks that it is at a great distance from him at the foot of the 
hill, but when he looks at it from the base of the mountain, he 
believes quite the opposite. I saw there a group of yogis who never 
quit the foot of the mountain awaiting the fall of the leaves of this 
tree. It stands in an absolutely inaccessible place. The idolaters 
have all sorts of fables regarding this tree, one being that any one 
who eats of its leaves will recover his youth, though he be very 
old. But that is false. 

Beneath this mountain is the large bay which yields precious 
stones. Its waters appear extremely blue to the eye. From this 
spot, we travelled for two days and reached the large town, Dinar, 
situated on the sea coast, and inhabited by merchants. There 
is here a vast temple, the idol in which bears the name of the 

44. In a former context the word is spelt with a short, ‘a/

town. There are in this temple about a thousand Brahmins and 
yogis and about five hundred women, born of infidel fathers, who 
sing and dance every night before the idol. Hie town with its re- 
' venue belongs to the idol ; all those who live in the temple and those 
who visit it are fed therefrom. The idol itself is of gold, and of the 
height of a man. It has two large rubies for its eyes, and these, I 
was told, shine like two lamps at night. 

Then we left for the small town of Qaly (Galle) , six pctmsangs 
from Dlnur. A Mussulman, called ship’s captain Ibrahim, entertain- 
ed us in his house. We started thence to the town of Kalanbu 
(Colombo), one of the most beautiful and largest 
Colombo towns in the island. In it lives the Vazlr prince of 

the sea, Jalasti, who has about five hundred Abys- 
sinians with him. Three days after leaving Kalanbu we 
reached Battalah, mentioned once before. We visited its Sultan of 
whom we have spoken already. I found the 
patlam ship’s captain Ibrahim awaiting me, and we start- 

ed for Ma’bar. The wind was strong, and 
our ship was about to fill with water. We had no trained pilot, and 
so we drifted near some rocks, and narrowly escaped being wreck- 
ed; then we entered shallow water and our vessel grounded, and 
we were face to face with death. The 

to ma’bab passengers threw their belongings overboard, 

and bade farewell to one another. We cut down 
the mast of the ship and threw it into the sea ; the sailors made a 
float of planks. We were two parasangs from the shore. I wished 
to get down on the raft; but I had two concubines and two com- 
panions, and they said to me: “ Will you go on the raft and abandon 
us?” I preferred them to myself and said: “ Get down both of you, 
along with the young girl that I like.” The other girl said : “ I can 
swim well; I shall attach myself by a cord to the raft and swim 
with them.” My two comrades descended; one of them was Muham- 
mad, son of Farhan-ul-Tuzary, and the other an Egyptian. One 
of the girls was with them, and the second swam. The sailors tied 
ropes to the raft and swam with their aid. I put in their charge 
all my valuables, jewels and amber. They reached the shore in 
safety as the wind was favourable to them. As for myself, I stayed 
on the vessel, while the captain gained the shore on a plank. The 
sailors started making four rafts, but night came on before they 
were completed, and the water entered the ship. I got up on the 
poop and stayed there till the morning. Then many infidels came 
to us in one of their boats, and we went ashore with them, in the 
land of Ma’bar. We told them that we were friends of their Sultan

to whom they paid tribute, and they wrote to inform him of this. 
He was engaged in a war with the infidels, at a distance of two 
days’ journey; I wrote to tell him what had happened to me. 

The idolaters in question took us into a large wood and showed 
us a fruit that looked like a water-melon; it grows on the muql , the 
dwarf palm. Inside this fruit is a kind of cotton, containing a honey- 
like substance, which is extracted and made into a kind of pastry 
called Half and quite like sugar. They also served us excellent fish. 
We stayed there three days at the end of which an amir, named 
Qamar-ud-dm came from the Sultan together with a detachment of 
horse and foot. They brought a palanquin and ten horses. I 
mounted a horse, and so did my friends, the captain of the ship, 
and one of the two girls; the other was carried in' the palanquin. 
We reached the fort of' Harkatu 44 * where we spent the night, 
and where I left the ydung girls, some of my slaves, and my compa- 
nions. The second day we arrived at the camp of the Sultan. 

The Sultan of Ma’har was Ghayas-ud-dln-ul Damaghany ; at 
first he was a cavalier in the service of Malik Majir, son of Abu-uh 
raja 45 , one, of the officers of Sultan Muhammad; then he served the 
amir Haji, son of the Sayyid Sultan Jalal-ud-dm. At last, he was 
invested with royalty. Before this he was called Siraj-ud-din; but 
at his accession he took the name Ghayas-ud-dln. Formerly Ma’bar 
was subject to the authority of Sultan Muhammad, king of Delhi. 
Later, my father-in-law the Sharif Jalal-ud-dln Ahsan Shah raised 
a revolt against him, and ruled for five years, after which he was 
killed and replaced by one of his amirs, J Ala-ud-din Udaijy who ruled 
for a year. At the end of this period, he went to war against the 
infidels, seized much of their wealth as spoil and returned to his 
kingdom. The following year, he went on a second expedition 
against them, and routed them and put a large number to the sword. 
The same day on which he inflicted this disaster on them, he hap- 
pened to remove his helmet in order to drink; an arrow shot by 
an unknown hand struck him and he died at once. His son-in-law, 
Qutb-ud-dm, was placed on the throne ; but as his conduct was un- 
popular, he was killed at the end of forty days. The Sultan Ghayas- 
ud-dm was invested with authority, he married the daughter of the

Sultan and the Sharif Jalal-ud-dln ; it is her sister that I had mar- 
ried in Delhi. 

My arrival at the court of Sultan Ghay&s~ud~din : 

When we came near his camp, the Sultan sent one of his cham- 
berlains to receive us. He was seated in a wooden tower. It is 
the custom in all India that no one enters the Sultan’s presence 
without boots on. Now, I had no boots with me, an idolater gave 
me a pair, though there were some Mussulmans there, and I was 
surprised that the infidel was more generous to me than these. I 
then appeared before the Sultan who asked me to be seated, 
sent for the QazI and the HajI 46 Sadr-ul-Zaman Baha-ud-dm, and 
lodged me in three tents near himself. The people of the country 
call these tents khiyam (pi. of khaimah) . The Sultan sent me 
carpets and food comprising the rice and meat usual in this coun- 
try. It is the rule here, as in our own lands, to serve butter-milk 
at the end of the meal. 

Later, I had an interview with the Sultan, and proposed to him 
the plan of despatching an army to the Maldives. He resolved to do 
this, and chose the ships for the enterprise. He intended to send a 
present to the Sultanah of the Maldives, and robes of honour and 
gifts to the amirs and vazirs. He entrusted to me the task of drawing 
up his contract of marriage with the sister of the Sultanah ; finally 
he ordered three vessels to be loaded with alms for the poor in the 
islands, and said to me; “You will come back at the end of five 
days.” But the admiral KHwajah Sarlak told him: “ It will be possi- 
ble to reach the Maldives only in three months from now.” “If that 
be so”, replied the Sultan addressing me, “ come to Fatten ; after we 
finish the present campaign, we may return to our capital Mutrah 
(Madura) ; and the expedition will start from there ” I then stay- 
ed with him and, while waiting, I sent for my slave-girls and 
comrades. 

The march of the Sultan and his disgraceful conduct in massacring 
women and children : 

The country we had to traverse was an impenetrable jungle of 
trees and reeds. The Sultan ordered that every one in the army, 
great and small alike, should carry a hatchet to cut down these 
obstacles. When the camp was struck, he set out on horseback 
towards the forest together with his soldiers who felled the trees 
from morning to noon. Then food was served, and the whole

army ate, troop by troop ; afterwards they resumed cutting trees 
till the evening. All the infidels found in the jungle 
were taken prisoners ; they had stakes sharpened at both 
ends and made the prisoners carry them on their shoulders. Each 
was accompanied by his wife and children, and they were thus led 
to the camp. .It is the practice here to surround the camp with a 
palisade, called katkar and having four gates. They make a second 
katkar round the king’s habitation.. Outside the principal enclo- 
sure, they raise platforms about three feet high, and light fires on 
them at night. Slaves and sentinels spend the night here, each 
holding in his hand a bundle of very thin reeds. When the infidels 
approach for a night attack on the camp, all the sentries light their 
faggots, and thanks to the flames, the night becomes as bright as 
day, and the cavalry sets out in pursuit of the idolaters. 

In the morning, the Hindus who had been made prisoners the 
day before, were divided into four groups, and each of these was 
led to one of the four gates of the main enclosure. There they were 
impaled on the posts they had themselves carried. Afterwards 
their wives were butchered and tied to the stakes by their hair. 
The children were massacred on the bosoms of their mothers, and 
their corpses left there. Then they struck camp and started cut- 
ting down the trees in another forest, and all the Hindus who were 
made captive were treated in the same manner. This is a shame- 
ful practice, and I have not seen any other sovereign adopt it ; it 
was because of this that God hastened the end of Ghayas-ud-dfn. 

One day the Qazi and I were dining with this prince, the Qazi 
being to his right and I to his left, and an idolater was brought 
before him together with his wife and son aged seven years. The 
Sultan made a sign with his hand to the executioners to cut off the 
head of this man ; then he said to them in Arabic ; 4 and his son 
and his wife \ They cut off their heads, and I turned my eyes 
away. When I composed myself, I found their heads lying on the 
grounds - 

On another occasion I was with Sultan Ghayas-ud-dln“when 
a Hindu was brought to him. He spoke some words that I could 
not understand, and at once many of his followers drew their 
swords. I got up hurriedly, and he said: ‘Where do you go? 5 I 
answered : “I go to say my afternoon (4 p.xn.) prayer. 55 He 

understood my motive, laughed, and ordered the hands and feet 
of the idolater to be cut off. On my return I found this unhappy 
man swimming in his blood.

The victory which Ghayas-ud-din won over the infidels , and ivhich 
is among the greatest successes of Islam : 

Adjoining his state was that of an infidel sovereign named 
Balal Dev, who was one of the principal Hindu kings. His army 
exceeded 100,000 men, besides 20,000 Mussulmans, rakes, criminals 
and fugitive slaves. This monarch aspired to conquer the country 
of Ma’bar, of which the Muslim army numbered only 6000 troops, a 
good half of them being excellent soldiers, and the rest absolutely 
worthless. The Muhammadans came to blows with him near the 
village of Kubban ; he routed them, and they had 
kannanur to fall hack on Mutrah (Madura), their capital, 

koppam The infidel sovereign camped near Kubban 

(Koppam, Kannanur) , one of the largest and 
strongest places held by the Mussulmans. He besieged it for six 
months, at the end of which the garrison had provisions for only 
fourteen days. Balal Dev proposed to the besieged to offer them 
a. safe conduct if they would retire leaving him to occupy the town ; 
but they replied : “ We must inform our Sultan of this.” He then 
offered them a truce for fourteen days and they wrote to Sultan 
Ghayas-ud-din describing their situation to him. The Sultan read 
their letter to the people on the following Friday. The 
faithful wept and said : “ We will sacrifice our lives to God ; 
if the infidel takes that town, he will then lay siege to 
us ; we prefer to die by the sword.” They then engaged to ex- 
pose themselves to death, and set out the next day, removing their 
turbans from their heads and placing them round the necks of 
their horses, which was an indication that each of them sought 
death. They posted the bravest and most courageous among them, 
some three hundred, as the vanguard ; the right wing was under 
Saif-ud-dm Bahadur (hero), a pious and brave lawyer, and the 
left under A1 Malik Muhammad, the silhaddr (armour bearer). 
The Sultan himself was in the centre with three thousand, and the 
rear-guard was formed by another three thousand under the com- 
mand of Asad-ud-din Kaikhusru Alfarisy (the Farsian) . In this 
order, the Mussulmans set out at the siesta hour towards the 
infidel camp and attacked it, when the soldiers were off their guard, 
having sent away their horses to graze. The infidels, thinking that 
robbers were attacking the camp, went out in disorder to combat 
the assailants. Meanwhile, Sultan Ghayas-ud-dm arrived, and the 
Hindus suffered the worst of all defeats. Their sovereign tried to 
mount a horse though he was aged eighty. Nasir-ud-din, nephew 
and successor of the Sultan, overtook the old man and was about 
to kill him, for he did not know who he was. But one of his slaves 
said: 'He is the Hindu sovereign ’ ; he then made him prisoner

and led him to his uncle, who treated him with apparent 
consideration till he extorted from him his riches, his elephants 
and horses, and promised to release him. When he had yielded 
up all his wealth to him, he had him killed and flayed. His skin 
was stuffed with straw and hung up on the wall of Madura where 
I saw it in the same position. 

To return to our subject. I left the camp and went ' to the 
town of Fattan, a large and fine city on the coast. It has an 
admirable harbour, and there is a large wooden 
pavilion in it erected on stout beams and fattan 
reached by a covered pathway also made 
of wood. When an enemy arrives, all the ships in port are attached 
to this pavilion ; the soldiers and archers mount up the pavilion, 
and the enemy gets no chance of inflicting any injury. In this town 
there is a beautiful mosque built of stone, and grapes and excellent 
pomegranates are available in large quantities. Here I met the 
pious Shaikh Muhammad-ul-isabury, one of the fakirs who have a 
troubled spirit and who let their hair hang loose over their shoul- 
ders. He kept a lion with him which he had tamed, and which ate 
with the fakirs and sat with them. The Shaikh had about thirty 
fakirs with him, one of whom owned a gazelle which lived in the 
same place as the lion who did no harm to it. I stayed in Fattan. 

Meantime, a yogi had prepared for Sultan Ghayas-ud-dln some 
pills calculated to improve his virility. It is said that iron filings 
were among the ingredients of these pills. The Sultan swallowed 
a larger dose than was good for him and fell ill. In this state he 
reached Fattan ; I went out to meet him and offered him a present. 
When he had settled down, he sent for admiral KHwajah Sarur, 
and said to him : “ Take up nothing but equipping the vessels 
chosen for the expedition to the Maldives.” He wished to remit to 
me 'the cost of the present I had made to him ; I refused, but re- 
pented afterwards, for ■ he died, ■ and I got noth- 
ing. The Sultan remained at Fattan -for half a madtjra 
month, and then left for his capital ; I stayed 
there for fifteen days after his departure, and then started 
for Madura, the place of his residence, a large town with broad 
streets. The first prince who made it his capital was my father-in- 
law, the Sultan Sharif Jalal-ud-dln Ahasan Shah, who made it 
look like Delhi, building it with care. 

On my arrival at Madura, I found a contagious disease pre- 
vailing there ; people died of it in a short time. Those who 
were attacked by it succumbed on the second or third day ; if death 
was delayed, it was only till the fourth day. ' When I went out, I

saw only the sick or the dead. I bought a young slave girl here, 
being assured that she was healthy ; but she died the next day. 
One day a woman whose husband had been a vazlr of Sultan 
Ahasan Shah came to see me with her son aged eight years, a nice 
lad full of intelligence and spirit. She complained of poverty, and 
I gave some money to her and her son. Both of them were strong 
and healthy ; but the next day the mother returned, asking for a 
shroud for her son, as he had died suddenly. I saw in the audi- 
ence hall of the Sultan, at the time of his death, hundreds of women 
servants who had been brought to pound rice for preparing food 
for other persons than the sovereign ; these women, taking ill, 
were thrown on the ground, exposed to the sun’s heat. 

When Ghayas-ud-din entered Madura, he found that his 
mother, his wife and his son had fallen ill. He remained three days 
in the city, and then he went out to a river at a distance of one 
parasang , on the banks of which is a temple belonging to the infi- 
dels. I went to meet him on a Thursday and he ordered me to be 
lodged with the Qazi. When the tents had been erected for me, I 
saw people hastening along pushing one another. One of them said: 
‘The Sultan is dead’; another asserted that it was his son that had 
died. We ascertained the truth, and found that the son was dead. 
The Sultan had no other son, and this death aggravated his own 
disease. The Thursday following, the mother of the Sultan died. 

The death of the Sultan , the accession of his brother’s son and my 

separation from the new prince : 

The third Thursday, Ghayas-ud-din died. I heard of it and 
hastened to return to town, for fear of a tumult. I met the nephew 
and successor, Nasir-ud-dln, who had been called to the camp as 
the Sultan had left no son. He urged me to retrace my steps and 
return to the camp with him ; but I refused, and he took this re- 
fusal to heart. Nasir-ud-dln had been a domestic servant at Delhi 
before his uncle came to the throne. When Ghayas-ud-din became 
king, the nephew fled to him in the guise of a fakir, and it was the 
will of fate that he should rule after his uncle. When they had 
sworn allegiance to Nasir-ud-dln, poets recited his praises and he 
gave them magnificent gifts. The first that rose to recite 
verses was the Qazi Sadr-ul-Zaman, to whom he gave five hun- 
dred gold pieces and a robe of honour; then came the vazlr al- 
QazI (the judge) whom the Sultan gratified with two thousand 
pieces of silver. As for myself, he presented me with three 
hundred gold' pieces and a robe of honour. He distributed alms to 
the fakirs and the poor. When the preacher delivered the first 
discourse in which he inserted the name of the new sovereign, they

showered on him drachmas and dinars from plates of gold and 
silver. The funeral of Sultan Ghayas-ud-din was celebrated with 
pomp. Every day the Quran was read in full near his tomb. Then 
those whose duty it was to read the tenth section of the holy book 
gave a reading* after which food was served and the public ate ; 
finally* silver pieces were distributed to each person according to 
his rank. These things were done for forty days. They repeated 
the ceremony every year on the anniversary day of the death of 
the deceased. 

The first measure of Sultan Nasir-ud-dm was to dismiss the 
vazir of his uncle, and to exact sums of money from him. He 
installed in the vazirate Malik Badr-ud-din, the same man that had 
been sent by his uncle to meet me when I was at Fattan. He 
died not long after, and the Sultan appointed KHwajah Sarur, the 
admiral, as vazir, and ordered that lie should be styled KHwajah 
Jahan, just like the vazir of Delhi. Whoever addressed him by 
any other title had to pay a certain number of gold pieces (as fine) . 
After this Sultan Nasir-ud-dln killed the son of his paternal aunt, 
who was the husband of Ghayas-ud-dxn’s daughter, and married 
her himself. He heard that Malik Mas‘ud had visited his cousin 
in the prison before he was put to death, and he murdered him as 
also Malik Bahadur, a generous and virtuous hero. He gave 
orders that I should be provided with all the vessels that his uncle 
had assigned for my expedition to the Maldives. 

But I fell ill of a fever which is fatal in this fever 
country, and thought that it would be my end. 

God inspired me to have recourse to the tamarind, which 
is very abundant in this country. I took about a pound of it, put 
it in water and drank it. It relaxed me for three days, and God 
cured me of the disease. I took a dislike to the town of Madura, 
and asked the Sultan for permission to go away. He said to me : 
“Why should you go? There Is only one month for going to the 
Maldives. Stay then till we give you all that the master of the 
world (the late Sultan) ordered to be given to you.” I refused, and 
he wrote in my favour to Fattan that I might 
sail in any vessel of my choice. I returned to RETUR3sr TO 
Fattan, and -found there eight vessels sailing 
for Yemen, and I boarded one of them. We met four ships 
of war which engaged us for a time and then retired ; afterwards, 
we reached Kulam (Quilon) . As I still felt the effects of my ill- 
ness, 1 stayed three months in this town, and then embarked with 
a view to go to Sultan Jamal-ud~din of Hanaur ; but the idolaters 
attacked us between Hanaur and Fakanur,

How we were despoiled by the Hindus : 

When we reached the small island between Hanaur and 
Fakanur, the Hindus assailed us with a dozen war ships, and after 
a vigorous combat, overpowered us. They took all 1 had, includ- 
ing -the reserve I had kept against emergencies, as well as the 
pearls, precious stones given to me by the king of Ceylon, my 
clothes, and the provisions for travel given to me by good and holy 
men. They left me no dress but a pair of trousers. They seized 
the belongings of all the passengers and sailors, and forced us to 
disembark. I returned to Calicut and entered one of the mosques 
there. A jurisconsult sent me a robe, the Qazi a 
calicut again turban and a certain merchant another robe. 

Here I learnt of the marriage of vazir ’Abd-ul- 
lah with the Sultanah KHadijah, after the death of the 
vazir Jamal-ud-din; and I also learned that the wife whom I 
had left pregnant had given birth to a male child. I wanted then 
to go to the Maldives, but I recollected my enmity with the vazir 
5 Abd~ul~lah. Hence I opened the Quran and these words caught 
my eyes : “ Angels shall descend on them and say to them : £ Fear 
not, and be not sad’” (Quran, xli. 30). 1 

Maldives implored the benediction of God, and set sail. At 

again the end of ten days I reached the islands and dis- 

embarked on Kannalus. The governor of this island, 
’Abd-ul-’Aziz Almaqdashawy, welcomed me kindly, entertained me 
and fitted out a boat for me. I then went to Hululy, the island to 
which the Sultanah and her sisters went for diversion and for bath- 
ing. The natives call these amusements tatjar and indulge in them 
on board. The vazlrs and chiefs sent the Sultanah presents and gifts 
when she was on this island. I met there the sister of the Sul- 
tanah, her husband, the preacher Muhammad, son of vazir Jamal- 
ud-din, and his mother, who had been my wife. The preacher 
visited me and ate with me. 

Meanwhile some of the islanders went to vazir ‘Abd-ul-lah 
and told him of my arrival. He made enquiries about my condi- 
tion and about my companions. 

They told him that I had come to take my son, aged about two 
years. The mother of the child went to the vazir to lodge a com- 
plaint about my plan ; but he told her : c I will not hinder him from 
taking his son.’ He pressed me, to go to the island (of Mahal), 
and lodged me in a house opposite the tower of his palace that 
he might know all about my movements. He sent me a complete 
robe, betel and rosewater according to custom. I took to him two 
pieces of silk to throw them before him when I saluted him. They

took it from me, and the vazxr did not come out that day to receive 
me. My son was brought to me, and it seemed to me that his stay 
with the islanders suited him best. So I gave him back to them. 
I remained five days in the island, and it seemed best for me to 
hasten my departure and I asked for permission to leave. The 
vazxr called me, and I went to him. They brought the two pieces 
of silk they had taken from me before, and 1 threw them down 
while saluting the vazxr according to custom. He made me sit by 
his side, and asked me how I fared. I ate with him and washed 
my hands in the same basin as he, which he never does with any 
one. Then they brought betel, and I returned. The vazir sent 
me cloths and bustus (hundreds of thousands) of cowries, and be- 
haved himself perfectly.

And sailing on the feast of St. Stephen, 1 we navigated the 
Indian sea until Palm Sunday, and then arrived at a very noble 
city of India called Columbum, where the whole world's pepper is 
produced. Now this pepper grows on a kind of vines, which are 
planted just like in our vineyards. These vines produce clusters 
which are at first like those of the wild vine, of a green colour, and 
afterwards are almost like bunches of our grapes, and they have a 
red wine in them which I have squeezed out on my plate as a 
condiment. When they have ripened, they are left to dry upon 
the tree, and when shrivelled by the excessive heat the dry clus- 
ters are knocked off with a stick and caught upon linen cloths, 
and so the harvest is gathered. 

These are things that I have seen with mine eyes and handled 
with my hands during the fourteen months that I stayed there. 
And there is no roasting of the pepper, as authors have falsely 
asserted, nor does it grow in forests, but in regular gardens ; nor 
are the Saracens the proprietors but the Christians of St. Thomas. 
And these latter are the masters of the public steel-yard, from 
which I derived, as a perquisite of my office as Pope's legate, every 
month a hundred gold fan , and a thousand when I left. 2 

There is a church of St. George there, of the Latin communion, 
at which I dwelt. And I adorned it with fine paintings, and 
taught there the holy Law. And after I had been there some time 
I went beyond the glory of Alexander the Great, when he set up

2. “The value of the fanam (Marignolli’s fan ) has varied so much that 
it is difficult to estimate what the legate received in this way. Mars den 
makes the fanam 2 1 /&d. ( Marco Polo , p. 656) . In the beginning of last cen- 
tury, Visscher says the fanam of Cochin was about l%d., that of Calicut 6d., 
and that of Quilon 15d. Late in the same century Friar Paolino states the 
Paliacat fanam at 9 sous or 4 %d., that of Tan j ore or Calicut at 6d. or 7d., 
and that of Madura at 3%d. And Ibn Battuta (iv, 174) tells us that 100 
fanams were equal to 6 dinars, which would make the fanam nearly 8d. 
This last may be taken as probably about the value of our author's fan . 
So his monthly perquisite would be about £3.6s., and the present he received 
at parting £33. If we may judge from the calculations based on Ibn 
Battuta's statement of prices at Delhi in his time, the money would repre- 
sent at least ten times as much wealth as at present.”— Yule.

and memorial, in the corner of the world over against Paradise, 
and anointed it with oil ! In sooth it was a marble pillar with a 
stone cross upon it, intended to last till the world's end. And it 
had the Pope’s arms and my own engraved upon it, with inscrip- 
tions both in Indian and Latin characters. 3 

I consecrated and blessed it in the presence of an infinite multi- 
tude of people, and I was carried on the shoulders of the chiefs in 
a litter or palankin like Solomon’s. 

So after a year and four months I took leave of the brethren, 
and after accomplishing many glorious works I went to see the 
famous Queen of saba. By her I was honourably treated, and 
after some harvest of souls (for there are a few Christians there) 

I proceeded by sea to Seyllan, a glorious mountain opposite to 
Paradise.

B. Ceylon : Concerning Adam’s Garden and the Fruits thereof. 

Plantain : The garden of Adam in Seyllan contains in the 

first place plantain trees which the natives call figs. But the 
plantain -has more the character of a garden plant than of a tree. 
It is indeed a tree in thickness, having a stem as thick as an oak, 
but so soft that a strong man can punch a hole in it with his finger, 
and from such a hole water will flow. The leaves of those plan- 
tain trees are most beautiful, immensely long and broad, and of a 
bright emerald green ; in fact, they use them for table cloths, but 
serving only for a single dinner. Also new-born children, after 
being washed and salted, are wrapped up with aloes and roses in 
these leaves, without any swathing, and so placed in the sand. 
The leaves are some ten ells in length, more or less, and I do not 
know to what to compare them (in form) unless it be to ele- 
campane. The tree produces its fruit only from the crown ; but 
on one stem it will bear a good three hundred. At first they are 
not good to eat, but after they have been kept a while in the. 
house they ripen of themselves, and are then of an excellent odour, 
and still better taste ; and they are about the length of the longest 
of one’s fingers. And this is a thing that I have seen with mine

both sides of the cut the figure of a man crucified, as if one had 
graven it with a needle point. 4 And it was of these leaves that 
Adam and Eve made themselves girdles to cover their nakedness. 

Cocoanut: There are also many other trees and wonderful 

fruits there which we never see in these parts, such as the 
Nargil. Now the Nargil is the Indian Nut. Its tree has a most 
delicate bark, and very handsome leaves like those of the date- 
palm. Of these they make baskets and corn measurers; they use 
the wood for joists and rafters in roofing houses ; of the husk or 
rind they make cordage ; of the nutshell cups and goblets. They 
make also from the shell spoons which are antidotes to poison. 
Inside the shell there is a pulp of some two fingers thick, which is 
excellent eating, and tastes almost like almonds. It burns also, 
and both oil and sugar can be made from it. Inside of this there 
is a liquor which bubbles like new milk and turns to an excellent 
wine. 5 

Mango : They have also another tree called amburan 6 having 

a fruit of excellent fragrance and flavour, somewhat like a peach. 

Jack : There is again another wonderful tree called chake- 

baruhe , 7 as big as an oak. Its fruit is produced from the trunk 
and not from the branches, and is something marvellous to see, 
being as big as a great lamb, or a child of three years old. It has 
a hard rind like that of our pine-cones, so that you have to cut it 
open with an axe ; inside it has a pulp of surpassing flavour, with 
the sweetness of honey and of the best Italian melon ; and this 
also contains some five hundred chestnuts of like flavour, which 
are capital eating when roasted.

rarely do such a thing) they will retire a long way, as well as for 
other occasions. 

They eat only once a day, and never oftener ; they drink 
nothing but milk or water ; they pray with great propriety of 
manner ; they teach boys to form their letters, first by writing 
with the finger on sand, and afterwards with an iron style upon 
leaves of paper, or rather I should say upon leaves of a certain 
tree. 

In their cloister they have certain trees that differ in foliage 
from all others. These are encircled with crowns of gold and 
jewels, 8 and there are lights placed before them, and these trees 
they worship. And they pretend to have received this right by 
tradition from Adam, saying that they adore those trees because 
Adam looked for future salvation to come from wood. And this 
agrees with that verse of David’s c<f Dicite in gentibus , quia Domi - 
nus regnabit in ligno though for a true rendering it would be 
better to say curabit a ligno. 9 

These monks, moreover, never keep any food in their house 
till the morrow. They sleep on . the bare ground ; they walk bare-

go about in procession every morning begging rice for their 
day’s dinner. The princes and others go forth to meet them with 
the greatest reverence, and bestow rice upon them in measure 
proportioned to their numbers ; and this they partake, of steeped 
in water, with coconut milk and plantains. These things I speak of 
as an eyewitness ; and indeed they made me a festa as if I were 
one of their own order.

A. Coral at Dondera Head 

The Ta Fo shan lies between Ya-li (Galle) and Kao~lang~pu 
(Colombo) . 

In the keng-wu year of the Chih-shun period (A.D. 1330) in 
the tenth moon, in winter, for two days I was sailing along the 
base of this mountain. All night the moonlight made it as clear 
as day, the sea was calm, the water so clear that I could look down 
in it and see things floating about on the bottom. There was a 
tree in the waters which moved about. I pointed it out to the 
sailors and said to them, “Is this not a piece of pure lang-kan 
coral?” They replied, “ It is not.” 

“ Is it then the shadow of the (magic) so4o tree in the moon?” 
They answered, “It is not.” 

Then I told a boy to get into the water and to fetch it. He 
pulled up a soft and slimy thing, and brought it out of the water 
when it became as hard as iron. I took it and examined it. It 
was barely a foot long. Then this branch curled up into a knot, 
and, strange to relate, on the branch there was a half-opened 
flower with a single stamen, of a reddish colour, and like a half 
opened peony, or a lotus flower. 

The sailors, holding candles, stood around looking on. Then 
they all began hopping about like birds, laughing, and saying, 
“Why, this is the precious tree (i.e., the coral tree) which has 
bloomed. Truly, of the marvellous things of the sea there are 
some which are novel even to the Chinese ; for over forty years 
we have never seen the like of this, and there is not a chance in 
a thousand that it could be found again, and now you, Sir, it is 
yours !” 

The following day I composed a piece of poetry in the antique 
style in an hundred verses to commemorate the event, and stuck 
it away in my sleeve to carry home. When An Yu (Yii An ?) , 
hsien-Sheng of Yii-Chang, saw it, he composed an additional piece 
of poetry. Down to the present day it has been kept in the Chun- 
tzu t’ang (at Nan-chang) as a curious record.

(Kao-lang-pu) is at the foot of the Ta Fo shan. The whole 
shore of the bay is nothing but jagged rocks standing up or lying 
flat. The ground is damp, the soil is poor, and rice very dear. The 
climate is hot, the customs of the natives are boorish. 

Sailors who have had the misfortune to be wrecked, and who 
have to stop for a while in this place, are fleeced by the ruler of 
whatever merchandize their junk may have on board, even the 
gold and jewels are sent to him. He looks upon them as sent by 
Heaven, and little he knows and cares that they were expected by 
the sailors’ wives and children to save them from starvation and 
cold. 

The natives, men and women, do up their hair in a knot and 
wrap around them a sarong of Pa-dT ieh-na~chien (i.e., Javanese) 
cotton cloth. They boil sea-water to make salt, and ferment the 
juice of the sugar-cane to make spirits. 

They have a ruler. The native products are red stones 
(rubies), the same as those of Seng-ka-la (i.e., near Beligam.) 

The goods used (by the Chinese) in trading are Pa-tan (Shali-

silver, and such like things.

animals in sacrifice to the gods of the* sea. Then they make choice

of which is held open by means of a bamboo ring, and, providing 
himself with a safety-rope, he ties a stone to his waist and lets him- 
self sink down to the bottom of the sea. Then with his hand he 
pulls up the pearl-oysters and puts them in his bag. In response 
to his pulling the rope, the men in the boat, who are looking after 
it, pull him and the bag of pearl-oysters on his neck, into the boat. 
And so they do until the boats are full, when they go back to the 
government station, where, under the guard of soldiers, (the 
oysters) remain for a number of days until the meat rots. Then 
they remove the shells and wash away the rotten meat by stirring 
them around in a sieve, by which means the flesh is got rid of and 
the pearls are left. They are then classed by means of a very fine 
sieve, and the officials levy as duty five-tenths of the whole, and 
the five-tenths remaining are equally divided among the boat 
crews, if indeed the gods of the sea have not claimed the divers, 
for many of them get buried in the bellies of rapacious fish. Alas! 
how sad a fate. 

Some sailor men, who are so lucky as to get their shares of 
profits for some years, sell their pearls for money to do some trad- 
ing, and go home, happy with the large profits they have made, 
which establish them in opulence ; but such are few indeed.

at once to this country. The following year in the spring with the

It is in the neighbourhood of the Tu-lan rocks. The soil is 
black and well suited for the raising of cereals. The people are 
indolent in their work of the tillage of the soil. They count yearly 
(to eke out their subsistence) on the contribution made them by 
the Wu-tieh (Orissa) rice trade. Sometimes through stress of 
weather (these Wu-tieh boats? or a boat?) arrive late after the 
departure of the horse ships (from Kan-mai-li, the Comoro Islands) 
and without a full cargo ; the wind blows (too) violently (for them 
to proceed). Other times the wind is contrary, and it (or they) 
cannot reach the Sea of Lambri and escape the danger from the 
ragged rocks in (the bay of) Kao-lang-fu (Colombo) , so they pass 
the winter in this place, remaining until the summer of the follow-

(from Kan-mai-li?), then they go on (in their company so as to 
escape the pirates which infested the coast?) to Ku-li-fo (Calicut) 
to trade. 

As to the usages and customs, the clothing of both sexes is

This country is between Hsiao Kii-nan (Kain Colan) and 
Ku-li-fo (Calicut) 5 , it is also known (to the Chinese) as the Hsiao 
chiang-k‘ou, or “ Little Harbour.” The hill is bare and flat, it 
extends over several thousand (sic) li. 

The dwellings of the people are scattered about close together 
on every side with a sufficiency of land to supply the wants of 
each family, though the soil is far from good for tilling. 

The climate is hot, the usages of the people pure. They are 
hot-headed, and wherever they go, they carry about with them 
their bows and arrows. Men and women cut their hair and wrap 
around them Liu pu (i.e., cotton cloth from the Maidive Islands) . 

The natural products are pepper, superior to that of any other 
foreign port. It is impossible to state the number of plants which 
cover the hills (of Hsia-li). It is a creeper which grows like a 
wistaria vine, and which blooms in winter and bears fruit in 
summer. The people gather it and dry it in the sun to remove its 
pungent flavour. The pepper gatherers for the most part do not 
mind its flavour, but if they do, they get relief by using a decoction 
of CWuan-hsiung. The pepper of all other foreign parts is all the 
surplus product of this country.

Ku-li-fo is the most important of all the maritime centers of 
trade. It is close to Hsi-lan (Ceylon) and is the principal port of 
the Western Ocean. The land is flat and the soil poor, though 
grain can be grown. 

Each year they depend on the shipping from Wu-tieh (Orissa, 
for a sufficiency of grain). They cede the path to each other; 
they will not pick up things on the highways ; their customs ap- 
proach those of antiquity (in honesty). Should anyone steal an 
ox, the chief verifies the number of oxen, and (or) the rightful 
owner seizes all the property of the offender, and he is put to death. 

The seat of government is far off in the hills, but the place 
where trading is carried on is on the sea-shore. 

The native products include pepper very like that of Hsia-li 
(Hili). The people have public godowns in which they store it.

Each po-ho (bahar) is of 375 catties weight. The customs dues 
are two tenths. There are also kajang leaves, pH sang cloth, rose- 
water, jack-fruit, and catechu. The coral, pearls, and frankin- 
cense (obtained here), all come from Kan-mai-(li) and Fo-lang 
(Comoro Islands and the countries of the Franks?). The goods 
exported are the same as from Hsiao Kii-nan (Kain-Colan) . 

They have fine horses which come from the extreme West, 
and which are brought here by the shipload. Each horse will 
fetch from an hundred to a thousand pieces of gold, even going as 
high as four thousand, and the foreign people who fetch them 
thither would think the market a very bad one if they did not.

This country is beyond Ku-li-fo (Calicut) . The soil is fertile 
and level, (but) the cultivated fields few. The usages of the 
people are pleasing. As to the climate it is rather hot. Men and 
women wrap cotton cloth around them and wear a turban. They 
are sea-farers, and this is the principal port for the pearl trade. 

When anyone of the people commits a crime, they draw a cir- 
cle with lime on the ground and cause him to stand inside it, not 
allowing him to move. This is their most severe form of punish- 
ment. 

The natural products are Pa-tan cotton cloth and pearls, all 
of which latter are brought here from the Ti-san chiang (Gulf of 
Manar, Ceylon?), their place of production, and where the pearl 
eollectorate office gathers them all in and brings them over in 
small boats to this place (i.e. Jurfattan) , where the rich (traders) 
use gold and silver to force down the prices (?). If a boat should 
come (from Ti-san-chiang) to try to sell (directly) to the Chinese, 
its profits will be insignificant indeed (i.e., the Jurfattan pearl 
traders will undersell them with the Chinese ?).

A. Ceylon . 

This country (Hsi-lan shan) can be reached from Su-men~ 
ta-la with a fair wind in twelve days. The territory of this state 
is extensive, the population dense. The riches they have amassed 
equal those of Ohao-wa (Java). In the interior there is a high 
mountain which reaches to the sky. On the summit of the 
mountain are found blue mei~lan stones, yellow ya-kw stones, blue 
and red precious stones ; they are washed down in the sands after 
heavy rains and picked up. In the sea near the coast there is a 
pearl shoal ; here they are in the habit of going and gathering 
oysters with nets. These they pour into a pond, and when they 
have rotted, they wash them in a sieve and get the pearls. 

On the sea-coast there is a flat stone on which is the' impress 
of a foot over three feet long, and in it there is water which never 
evaporates. They say that in ages gone by Sakya Buddha, when 
going to the Tsui-lan islands (the Nicobar islands) went up this 
mountain and left this footprint. Down to the present day it is 
worshipped. Below it there is a temple called (the place of) the 
nirvana of Sakya Buddha. His true body (i.e., the lifelike repre- 
sentation) lying on its side is in this temple. There are also relics 
(Sarira) in his resting place. 

The climate is constantly hot ; the people are usually well-to- 
do, and rice is plentiful. 

The products of the soil are precious stones, pearls, ambergris, 
frankincense. The goods used (by the Chinese in trading) are 
gold and copper coins, blue and white porcelain-ware, coloured 
satins, coloured silk gauzes. 

Men and women bind their heads and wear a long shirt, wrap- 
ping around their middle a piece of cotton stuff. 

In the 7th year of Ytmg-lo (1409) Cheng Ho and others pre- 
sented to this temple in the name of the Emperor gold and silver 
altar vases and a coloured pennant embroidered in gold. They 
also put up a stone tablet with an inscription, and bestowed im- 
perial gifts on the king of the country and his chiefs. 

The King A-lieh-k'u-na-erh 1 showed himself ungrateful, and 
formed a plot to injure (the mission). The admiral, the eunuch

Cheng Ho, secretly made his preparations, and having previously 
issued orders, his messengers advanced rapidly and silently (lit,, 
“ gag in mouth ”) . In the middle of the night the guns were fired ; 
they dashed in and captured the king alive. 

In the ninth year of Yung-lo (AD. 1411) the king came to 
Court and made his submission, and sought the imperial favour. 
He was forgiven, and the kingdom was restored to what it had 
been originally. From that time the barbarians of the four quar- 
ters have all been filled with fear, and have taken absolutely to 
cherishing virtue.

This locality is on a headland facing Hsi-lan (Ceylon). To 
the interior it confines on Ku-li (Calicut). The climate is con- 
stantly hot, the soil is poor, the crops sparse. The villages are on 
the sea-shore. The usages and customs are honest. 

Men and women do their hair in a knot and wear a short shirt 
and a piece of cotton stuff wrapper around them. 

There is a caste of people called Mu-kua (Mukuva) ; they 
have no dwellings but live in caves, or nests in the trees. They 
make their living by fishing in the sea. Both sexes gd 
with the body naked and with a girdle of leaves or grass hanging 
before and behind. If one of them meets someone, he must crouch 
"down and hide himself by the way-side, where he must wait until 
he has passed by. 

The natural product is a great abundance of pepper. Wealthy 
people put up broad godowns in which to store it. In their trad- 
ing transactions they use a small gold coin called panan (fanam). 
The goods used in trading are coloured satins, white silk, blue and 
white porcelain- ware, gold and silver. 

Its ruler in grateful recognition of the imperial bounty con- 
stantly sends presents to our Court.

cent Seng-kia(la) (Ceylon), is the trade centre for the countries 
of the Western Ocean. The place is extensive and the soil barren, 
but wheat is in quite sufficient quantity. 

In their customs they are very honest. Those walking along 
make way for each other ; they will not pick up anything, on the 
road. They have not the bastinado as a punishment, they draw a 
circle with lime on the ground which (the culprit) is forbidden 
(to pass beyond) . 

Their ruler and people live far off in the hills. The place for 
all the business is on the sea-coast. 

The men wear a long shirt, around their heads they wrap 
white cotton stuff. The women wear a short shirt and wrap 
around them coloured cloth. Strings of gold pendants hang from 
their ears. On the tops of their heads they wear pearls, jewels, and 
coral, forming a fringe ; on their wrists and ankles are gold and 
silver bracelets, on their fingers and toes are gold and silver rings 
set with precious stones. They do up their hair in a knot behind 1 
the head. Their faces are white, their hair is black. 

There is a caste among them which goes naked ; they are 
called Mu-kua, the same as in Ko-chih (Cochin) . 

The country produces pepper equal to that of Hsia-li (Hills) . 
They have go downs to store it while waiting to be sold. They 
have oil of roses, po-lo-mi (jack-fruit) , cutch, flowered chintzes, 
coral, pearls, frankincense, putchuk, amber, but all of them are 
imported there from other countries. The fine horses found there 
come from the West They are worth hundreds or thousands of 
gold coins. 

The goods used in trading (by the Chinese) are gold, silver, 
coloured satins, blue and white porcelain, beads, musk, quick- 
silver, and camphor. 

The ruler, touched by the imperial bounty, constantly sends 
missions to Court with memorials on leaves of gold, and he presents 
articles of tribute.

XXXIV. 1451 AD. MAHXJAN 


A . The Nicobars and Ceylon 

In the Great Sea are the Tsui-lan shan (the Nicobar islands) . 
There are three or four islands (in the group) . The highest is called 
Su-tu-man . 1 Sailing before the north-east wind they can be reach- 
ed from Mao shan (Pulo Weh) in three days. 

The people all live in caves. All of them, males as well as 
females, go naked like wild animals, so they grow no rice, but feed 
on yams, bananas, jack-fruit, and such like things, or on fish and 
prawns. 

There is a foolish story to the effect that if they wore but a 
little piece of cotton to hide their nakedness, they would have ulcers 
and sores. This is because when anciently the Buddha crossed the 
sea, on coming here he took off his clothing and bathed, when the 
natives stole them. The Buddha thereupon cursed them. It is also 
commonly said that this is the country of Ch c ih-luan-wu . 2 

Westward from the Tsui-lan islands for seven or eight days 
(watches) one comes in sight of the Ying-ko-tsui 3 headland, and in 
another two or three days (watches) one comes to the Buddha 
Temple Hill, Dondera Head, and to the first place (reached in) 
Ceylon, the port called Pieh-lo-li . 4 At the foot of the hill by the 
sea-side there is a huge rock with the mysterious imprint of a foot 
which is greatly revered. It is about two feet long. Tradition says 
that it is the impress of the Buddha’s foot. In the impress there is 
a spring which does not dry up. People dip up the water and wash 
their face and eyes, saying, “The Buddha water will make us dean.” 
Such is the common belief of the people.

which must have been an important port, judging from what Ta-yiian says 
of it in his days . — Rockhill .

In the temple there is a sleeping Buddha, the couch is made of 
eagle-wood and ornamented with all kinds of precious substances, 
and the dais is equally beautiful. The Buddha’s tooth (and other 
relics) are also revered in this temple which is said to be the place 
of the nieh-pan (nirvana of the Buddha) . 

Travelling north-west by land 5 from this place (i.e., from Beli- 
gam) one then comes to where the king lives. 6 The king is a So-li 
man (from Coromandel) .

They believe in the Buddha, Sakyamuni, and show great rever- 
ence to elephants and cows. They burn cow dung to ashes with 
which they smear their bodies. As to cows, they drink their milk 
but do not eat their flesh. When one dies, they bury it. He who 
kills a cow is punished with death, or he may redeem himself with 
a cow’s head of gold. At dawn, both in the king’s palace and in 
the dwellings of the people, they mult mix up cow dung and smear 
the ground and worship the Buddha. [Stretching both hands wide 
out in front and stretching both legs out behind, they remain glued 
to the earth, both with their breast and abdomen, and so make their 
salutation.] (Duyvendak p. 47). 

The great mountain (near) the capital (i.e., Adam’s Peak) 
pierces the clouds. (On it) is a great footprint two feet deep and 
over eight feet long. Tradition says that it is the footprint of A-jan 
(Adam) , the first father of men ; that is to say, Pan-ku. 

The country is extensive, the people numerous. It equals the 
kingdom of Chao-wa (Java) in its wealth and plenty. 

The people have the upper part of the body bare; as to the 
lower part, they have a piece of stuff held in place by a waistband. 
Their bodies are clean shaven, but they leave the hah* of the head 
and wrap the head in a cotton cloth turban. 

When they mourn their fathers, they do not shave their bodies. 
The women draw their hair into a knot behind and wrap around 
themselves a piece of white cotton cloth. [Newly born male child- 
ren have their heads shaven; the head of the female child is not 
shaven, the hair is done up into a tuft and they let it grow until 
she is grown up.] (Duyvendak p, 47). They eat and drink in 
private, and men may not see them do so. 

Butter is a necessary ingredient in their food, and betel-nut is 
never out of their mouths.

They bum the dead and bury the bones. [It is the custom in 
a family in which a death has occurred, for the relatives’ and 
neighbours’ wives to assemble together and smite their breasts with 
their hands, and at the same time make loud lamentations and 
weeping.] (Duyvendak, p. 47) . 

The native products are ya-hu of which there are three colours, 
blue, red and yellow, and blue mi-lan stones. The two kinds of 
stones (called) hsi-la-ni and ku-mc-lan are found in the sand brought 
down by the water which falls on the slopes of the mountain (i.e., 
Adam’s Peak) and rushes down. 

The floating brightness of the rays of the sun on an island of 
the sea is the essence of the pearl oyster. 7 They have made a pond 
(in which) every two or three years they spread out oysters which 
officers guard; then the pearls can be sifted out and removed. 
[Those who sift those oysters to take them to the authorities, some- 
times steal and fraudulently sell them.] (Duyvendak, p. 47). 

They have rice, sesamum, and lentils, but no wheat. There are 
many cocoa-nut trees. 

As to fruits, they have the banana, the jack-fruit, sugar-cane, 
melons, and esculents. There are also cattle, sheep, fowl, and 
ducks. 

In trading they use a gold coin weighing 1 candareen 6 li, 
(also) Chinese musk, fine silk gauzes, embroidered taffetas, blue 
(and white) china-ware, copper cash, copper, iron, and camphor. 

Its tribute (to the Court of China) consists in pearls and preci- 
ous stones.

very unusual. From the fibre on the outer shell of the cocoa-nut 
they twine fine rope which is heaped up in the houses, and which 
the people aboard native ships from other places also come to buy. 
It is sold to other countries for building ships and other uses. In 
building native ships nails are never used, but with the clefts (the 
boards) are joined together and tied fast with this kind of rope,

Cochin is described as a day and a night’s sail 11 from Coilum, 
the present Quilon, most probably the Kaulam Malai of the Arabs 
( vide Yule’s Glossary under Malabar) , known to the Chinese navi- 
gators of the Tang dynasty, A,D. 618-913, as Muhlai. 

The king or ruler is of the solar race, 12 and is a sincere believer 
in Buddhism, 13 and has the greatest reverence for elephants and 
oxen; and every morning at day-light prostrates himself before an 
image of Buddha. 14 The king wears no clothing on the upper part 
of his person; he has simply a square of silk wound round his loins, 
kept in place by a coloured waist-band of the same material, and 
on his head a turban of yellow or white cotton cloth. The dress of 
the officers and the rich differs but little from that of the king. The 
houses are built of the wood of the cocoanut-tree and are thatched 
with its leaves, which render them perfectly water-tight. 15 

There are five classes of men in this kingdom. The Nairs 13 
rank with the king. In the first class are those who shave their 
heads, and have a thread or string hanging over their shoulder, 
these are looked upon as belonging to the noblest families. 17 In 
the second are the Muhammadans; in the third the Chittis, who 
are the capitalists; in the fourth the Kolings, who act as commission 
agents; in the fifth the Mukuas, who are the lowest and poorest of 
all. The Mukuas live in houses which are forbidden by the Govern- 
ment to be more than three feet high, and they are not allowed to 
wear long garments; when abroad, if they happen to meet a Nair 
or a Chitti they at once prostrate themselves on the ground, and 
dare not rise until they have passed by; these Mukuas get their 
living by fishing and carrying burdens.

The merchants of this country carry on their business like 
pedlars do in China. Here also is another class of men, called 
Chokis (Yogi), who lead austere lives like the Taoists of China, 
but who, however, are married. These men from the time they are 
born do not have their heads shaved or combed, but plait their 
hair into several tails, which hang over their shoulders; 18 they 
wear no clothes, but round their waists they fasten a strip 
of rattan, over which, they hang a piece of white calico; they carry 
a conch-shell, which they blow as they go along the road; they are 
accompanied by their wives, who simply wear a small bit of cotton 
cloth round their loins. Alms of rice and money are given to them 
by the people whose houses they visit. 

In this country there are two seasons, the wet and the dr-y. In 
the first two months of the rainy season there are only passing 
showers, during which time the people lay in a stock of provisions; 
in the next two months there is a continual downpour day and. night, 
so that the streets and market places are like rivers, and no one is 
able to go out of doors; during the last two months the rain gradu- 
ally ceases, and then not a drop falls for another six months. The 
soil is unproductive; pepper, however, grows on the hills and is 
extensively cultivated; this article is sold at five taels the P c o-ho, 19 
which is 400 cattis of Chinese weight. 

All trading transactions are carried on by the Chittis, who 
buy the pepper from the farmers when it is ripe, and sell it to 
foreign ships when they pass by. They also buy and collect 
precious stones and other costly wares. A pearl weighing 
three-and-a-half candareens can be bought for a hundred ounces 
of silver. Coral is sold by the catti ; inferior pieces of coral are 
cut into beads and polished by skilled workmen ; these are also 
sold by weight. The coinage of the country is a gold piece, called 
Fa-nan, weighing one candareen; there is also a little silver coin 
called a Ta-urh, which is used for making small purchases in the 
market. Fifteen Ta-urhs make a Fa-nan. There are no asses or 
geese in this country, and there is neither wheat nor barley ; rice, 
maize, hemp, and millet abound. Articles of tribute axe sent to 
China by our ships on their return voyage.

D. Ku-l% Calicut 

This sea port, of which Ma Huan gives us a most lengthy ac- 
count is described as a great emporium of trade frequented by 
merchants ' from all ' quarters. It is three days’ sail from 
Cochin, by which it is bordered on the south ; on the 
north it adjoins Cannanore (K‘an~nu~urh) ; it has the sea 
on the west ; and on the east, through the mountains, at 
a distance of 500 li (167 miles) , is the kingdom or city of 
K-an-pa-mei, 20 a great seat of cotton manufacture where is made, 
as also in the surrounding districts, a cloth called Chih-li (Chih-li- 
pu) cloth. It is made up into pieces, four feet five inches wide and 
twenty-five feet long; it is sold there for eight or ten gold pieces of 
their money. They also prepare raw silk for the loom, which they 
dye various shades of colour and then weave into flowered pattern 
goods made up into pieces four to five feet wide and twelve to thir- 
teen feet long. Each length is sold for one hundred gold pieces of 
their money. 

To return to Calicut, much .pepper is grown on the hills. Cocoa- 
nuts are extensively cultivated, many farmers owning a thousand 
trees; those having a plantation of three thousand are looked upon 
as wealthy proprietors. The king belongs to the Nair class, and, 
like his brother of Cochin, is a sincere follower of Buddha, and as 
such does not eat beef; his overseer, being a Muhammadan, does not 
eat pork. This led, it is said, in times past, to a compact being made 
between the king and his overseer, to the effect that if the king 
would give up eating pork the overseer would give up eating beef. 
This compact has been most scrupulously observed by the succes- 
sors of both parties upto the present day. The king at his devo- 
tions prostrates himself before an image of Buddha every morning; 
which being over, his attendants collect all the cow-dung about the 
place, and smear it over the image of the god. Some of the dung 
the king orders to be burnt to ashes and put into a small cotton bag, 
which he continually wears upon his person; and when his morn- 
ing ablutions are over, he mixes some of the powdered dung with 
water and smears it over his forehead and limbs; by so doing he 
considers he is showing Buddha the greatest reverence. 

Many of the king’s subjects are Muhammadans, and there are 
twenty or thirty mosques in the kingdom, to which the people resort

every seventh day for worship. On this day, during the morning, 
the people being at the mosque, no business whatever is transacted; 
and in the after part of the day, the services being over, business is 
resumed. 

When a ship arrives from China, the king’s overseer and a 
Chitti go on board and make an invoice of the goods, and a day is 
settled for valuing the cargo. On the day appoint- 
ed the silk goods, more especially the Khinkis Chinese s hip s 
(Kincobs) , are first inspected and valued, which 
when decided on, all present join hands, whereupon the broker 
says, “ The price of your goods is now fixed, and cannot in any way 
be altered.” 

The price to be paid for pearls and precious stones is arranged 
by the Weinaki broker, and the value of the Chinese goods taken in 
exchange for them is that previously fixed by the broker in the way 
above stated. 

They have no abacus on which to make their calculations, but 
in its place they use their toes and fingers, and, what is very won- 
derful, they are never wrong in their reckonings. 

The succession to the throne is settled in a somewhat curious 
manner. The king is not succeeded by his son, but by his sister’s 
son, because his nephew, being bom of his sister’s body is consi- 
dered nearer to him by blood. If the king has no sister the suc- 
cession goes to his brother ; if he has no brother it goes to a man 
of ability and worth. Such has been the rule for many generations. 

Trial by ordeal is much practised in this country, such as 
thrusting the finger of the accused into boiling oil, and then keeping 
him in jail for two or three days. If after that 
time the finger is ulcerated he is pronounced guilty ordeal 
and sentenced to punishment ; hut if his finger has 
received no injury he is at once set free, and escorted home by 
musicians engaged by the overseer. On his arrival home his rela- 
tives, neighbours, and friends make him presents and rejoice and 
feast together. 

The jack fruit and the plantain abound in this country, which 
is also well supplied with melons, gourds, and turnips, and every 
other kind of vegetable. Ducks, herons, and swallows are numbered 
among the feathered tribe, and there are bats as large as vultures, 
which hang suspended from the trees.

NAVIGATION TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIFTEENTH 

CENTURY 

Ibn Majid (in a work dated 1489-90 A.D.) says : “As to what 
concerns the entry to Malaka while coming from Kalikut, some- 
times the monsoon scatters the ships and sometimes carries them 
beyond it. The only exception is in the case of the well-armed 
ships coming from Campa, ready to set sail at the commencement 
of niruz or about that time. The monsoon brings back to Malaka 
ships from Hormuz and from Mekka and the late ships enter there 
(Malaka) on the 120th (day of niruz) ”. 

We may deduce from this passage that Malaka was in regular 
communication with India, Southern Arabia, the Red Sea and 
Campa in the last years of the 15th century.

THE ROLE OF GUJARATIS 

In February 1511, Albuquerque went from Cochin to Malaka 
with a flotilla of 18 ships : The Commentaries say : 

“ When they arrived at Ceylon, being East-West in relation 
to the isle of Sumatra, they descried a ship. Albuquerque gave 
orders to come alongside of it and they took it. They rejoiced 
much (to find) that it was a ship (armed) with Guzaratis, and 
they concluded from it that they were on the right path, for the 
(Gujaratis) know this route much better than all the other nations, 
because of the great commerce they have with these (eastern) 
countries.” 1

INDIAN MERCHANTS AND MERCHANDISE IN MALAKA 

(16TH CENTURY) 

i. Duarte Barbosa 

“ Many Moorish merchants reside in it, and also Gentiles, parti- 
cularly Chetis, who are natives of Cholmendel (Coromandel) : and 
they are all very rich and have many large ships, which they call 
jungos (junks) . They deal in all sorts of goods in different parts, 
and many other Moorish and Gentile merchants flock thither from 
other countries to trade ; some in ships of two masts from China 
and other places, and they bring thither much silk in skeins, many 
porcelain vases, damasks, brocades, satins of many colours, they 
deal in musk, rhubarb, coloured silks, much iron, saltpetre, fine 
silver, many pearls and seed pearl, chests, painted fans, and other 
toys, pepper, wormwood, Cambay stuffs, scarlet cloths, saffron, 
coral polished and rough, many stuffs of Palecate, of coloured 
cotton, others white from Bengal, vermilion, quicksilver, opium 
and other merchandise, and drugs from Cambay; amongst which 
there is a drug which we (Portuguese) do not possess and which 
they call putcho, and another called cacho, 1 and another called 
magican, which are gall nuts, which they bring from Levant to 
Cambay, by way of Mekkah, and they are worth a great deal in 
China and Java ”

EIGHTH VOYAGE FROM ADEN TO GUJERAT, 

If you start from Aden, you go true east till you lose sight of 
the mountains of Aden ; you continue to hold the same route a day 
and a night, then E. by N*, till the Southern wind sets in, then 
E. N. E. if possible, and if not, you follow the above course and 
go then E. N. E ; if there be little motion with the Awelama(?) 
there is no harm in it ; if a closer course is pursued you side to 
E. by N. and return from thence again to E. N. E. till the measure 
is equal ; in this measure Lyra 2 is five inches, or Sagitta six inches, 
or Canopus and Lyra are equal to three inches and a half. Under 
this measure (height) you see in the sea frequently sea snakes, 
which ought to be taken care of, as it is a good sign ; if you do not 
see them follow your way in the direction right east till you see 
them, and then change again your course to E. by N. till you see 
land. The best rule is to trust to the soundings and not to the sea- 
snakes, which, if they prove true, show themselves twice and thrice 
a day. Be it known, that sometimes in the monsoon Damani the 
ship is thrown by the current towards the Persian shore like mount 
Koholad Dabbaghat ; at this time the ship finds itself in the bar- 
barian channel ; there great precaution is necessary against the 
whirlpools ; besides this place there are such between Gujerat and 
Sind in the gulph Jakad, where the wind blows continually from 
the sea, and the current comes from the shore, so that waves and 
contrary currents are not wanting, and a ship falling in with them 
runs great risk to be lost, if it is not saved by the grace of God ; so 
it is necessary to avoid these places. You must turn from the 
Persian shore to the Arabian, and steer N. N. E. and N. E. by N. 
till you are out of reach of this dangerous place, after which you 
steer again E.N.E. Know that the wind of Canopus (S.S.E.) is not

The course is the same which has been already mentioned be-

inches and a half or seven inches ; 3 if from thence you can go 
tacking, you go in the direction of E. by S. or true east ; if it is 
impossible to keep this course, your way is E. by N. till the pole is 
made by seven inches and half or eight inches; from thence you 
follow the direction E. by S. till the pole is made with six inches, 4

is at hand. Be it known to you that in some of the islands of the 
Maldives the inhabitants hunt with dogs, bred to the purpose, the 
Orang-ootang (Nisnaus) and eat it. The Nisnaus is an animal 
resembling a monkey, but endowed with speech ; but generally 
monkeys are also called Nisnaus. I have heard from the brother 
of Janum Hamza, the late Intendant of Egypt, that coming one 
day on commercial business at the extremity of Yaman to a walled 
village, he alighted at a house where two boys lying on the ground 
were crying, and that out of commiseration he untied their fetters. 
The master of the house, returning, laughed at it, and said, these

The capital of Tchu-lien has seven enclosing walls, with a 
height of seven tefoi, and a hundred paces apart from one another. 
The outermost enclosure has a diameter of twelve li from south to 
north, and seven li from east to west. The first four walls are 
built of brick ; the two following are of mud, and that of the in- 
terior is of wood. All are covered with espaliers, or decorated 
with flowers. The first three enclosures are occupied by the peo- 
ple and include numerous water courses. The fourth enclosure 
contains the houses of four great officers. The fifth enclosure 
belongs to the sons of the king. In the sixth is a temple of Buddha, 
served by hundred Buddhist priests. Finally the seventh contains 
the palace of the king, or royal town, comprising more than four 
hundred buildings. The towns of the second order are thirty-one 
in number, twelve to the west of the royal residence, eight to the 
south, and eleven to the north. The reigning dynasty has occupied 
the throne for three generations 5 . 

The administration of justice is entrusted by the king to one 
of his four great officers. Those who have committed offences are 
put in fetters and receive from fifty to a hundred strokes with 
rods. The criminals are beheaded or crushed under the feet of an 
elephant. 

During feasts, the king and the four great officers salute each 
other, crossing their hands, and inclining the body like the Bud- 
dhist priests ; then they all sit together. They eat meat, but they 
do not drink wine. They have different sorts of soups, cakes and 
particular dishes of very good taste. They wear cotton . clothes. 
The feast is accompanied by music, singing and dances. The ser- 
vice is done by women.

their resources, give to the new household some fields, domestic 
animals, or only palm wine and some areca nuts and so on. From 
their side, the future relations send to the fiance some gold or silver 
rings ; some pieces of cloth ; and some beautiful clothes for his

fruits are the jujube, cocoanut palm, plum tree, jack, etc. The 
inhabitants cultivate the legumes, green and black, as well as many 
sorts of grains, notably wheat and rice. The bamboo thrives on 
their soil. 

This kingdom which in antiquity never had communications 
with the Empire, sent ambassadors for the first time under the 
dynasty of Song. They arrived at the ninth moon, of the eighth 
year ta-tchong-siang-fou (1009) ; the chief of them, named Cha~ 
li-san-ouen , was one of the four great officers of the reigning king 
Lo-tcha-lo-tcha. Then came a second ambassador named Pou- 
kia-sin and two councillors whose names were Ong-ou~fang and 
Ya-kin-kia. These strangers brought a letter from their sovereign 
for the Emperor, with the presents offered as tribute. They ad- 
vanced right up to the steps of the throne, and there deposited these 
pearls and precious stones, on a tray, and drawing back to the 
furthest end of the hall of audience, made two deep bows. The 
interpreter explained that they meant by that to show their respect 
and their attachment from far as well as from near. 

The letter of the king was more or less to the following effect : 
“I, Lo-tcha-lo-tcha, your subject, I have learnt through a merchant 
vessel which visited my kingdom that the great dynasty of Song 
was ruling the Empire, that already two emperors of your race had 
occupied the throne, that to-day the mandate of Heaven has been 
gloriously acquired by you. Some words of antiquity which have 
happily come to me, have first of all inspired the desire

to render homage to you. 6 Soon, I knew that your 
beneficial influence extends far, that your subjects are 
very submissive, that your high merit surpasses that of 
all your predecessors. You practise justice; you main- 

tain peace by the sole power of your virtue. You are 
strong and formidable; but you do not like to strike. Also, 
all the peoples turn towards you. You know to instruct the men 
and serve the Supreme Lord with a sincere piety. Your goodness 
extends even to the feeble reed; it reaches the fishes in the depths 
of the sea. That is why Heaven enlightens you, and protects 
you; that is why the graces descend on you, manifest, constant and 
brilliant. I, y6ur subject, I am humble and small; I reside, as 
have resided my ancestors, in a barbarous town, very far from 
the shining light of Chinese civilization. I see in some way, by the 
light of candles. However the noise of your praises which fills the 
world, could not fail to move me. My age, the stretch of the seas 
which separate us, and the great difficulties on the route to traverse, 
do not permit me to go, in order to carry myself the tribute that I 
wish to offer you ; but if it is forbidden me to contemplate from 
near and with my own eyes, the brilliance of your glory, I pour out, 
at least in this letter, the sincerity of 'my heart, and I send you 
respectfully the best products of my country. Just as ants are 
attracted by a sweet smell, as the sun-flower is drawn towards 
the sun as by an irresistible charm, so will be my envoys, to the 
number of fifty-two, arriving at the foot of your throne. I have 
ordered them to offer you a robe and cap decorated with pearls, 
pearls of different sizes weighing about 21,000 leang; 7 sixty pieces 
of ivory and sixty pounds of incense.” 

The ambassadors distributed besides, personally, their own 
presents, 6,600 leang of pearls and 3,300 pounds of perfumes. 8 

The words of antiquity to which the king Lo-tcha-lo-tcha made 
allusion in his letter were those which had been pronounced by the 
skipper of the foreign vessel which visited his kingdom who had 
said: “ During these ten years, there have been no storms at sea.” 


6. This is explained later. 

7. Sixteenth part of the Chinese pound of about 38 grammes. Thus 
nearly 80G kilogrammes of fine pearls are meant— exaggeration so fantastic 
as not to merit the least discussion.— H. de S-D. 

8. Another exaggeration not less ridiculous than the preceding. Ma 
Twan-lin is himself critical of the Song notices of Tchu-lien.— H, de S-D. .

The sense of these legendary words was that for ten years the 
Empire had for master a pious prince, endowed with all the vir- 
tues. Hence the desire of the king to send ambassadors to the 
court of China. 

San Ouen, 9 and his suite, having navigated in the beginning 
during seventy-seven days and nights, and passed before the Isles 
No-ou4an and Po4i-si4an arrived at the kingdom of Tchen-pin. 
Pursuing their course, sailing night and day, and passing before 
the Isle Y~ma4o4i, their vessel reached the coasts of the kingdom 
of Kou4o after a sixty-one days’ journey. The kingdom of Kou4o 
contains a high mountain called Kou4o, to which it owes its name. 
Again sixty-one days and nights of navigation, and the voyagers, 
after having left behind them the Isles Kia-pa, Kou-po4ao, and 
Tcheou-pao4ong , anchored on the shores of San-fo-tsi. Continu- 
ing to advance during eighteen days and nights, after traversing 
the mouth of the river Man-chan and coasting the Isles of Tien- 
tcho, they found themselves, in sight of the Isle of Pin4eou4ang« 
and could see in the distance, about 100 li towards the east, the 
tomb of Si-ouang mon. 10 They travelled again twenty days and 
twenty nights, passed the Islands of Yang-chan and Kieou-sing - 
chan , touched at the island of Pi-pa, and landed finally at the 
port Koung-tcheou (Canton) after a voyage of 1,150 days. 

The Emperor issued instructions to receive them with the 
greatest regard and to accord to them the same honours as to the 
envoys of Kouei-tse for all that concerns the ceremonial of audi- 
ence, the invitations to official dinners, etc. As they celebrated 
this year, the tenth anniversary of the coming of Tchin-tsong, 11 
San-Ouen, and his companions went to the Buddhist temple of 
Ki-ching-chenyouen, wishing to unite their prayers with those of 
the Buddhist priests who invoked Heaven to accord longevity to 
this prince. 

In the fourth year tien-hi (1020) , a second embassy from 
Tchu-lien entered the port of Kouang-tcheou. Hardly had he dis- 
embarked, the first ambassador named Pa4an-te~molie died of an 
exhausting illness. The credentials brought by him were sent to 
the court. The Emperor responded giving orders to treat honour- 
ably all the strangers who formed the suite of the late ambassa- 
dor, and send them away with very rich presents.

In the second year Ming-tao (1033) , a new ambassador of 
Tchu-lien, arrived. He bore a letter from his sovereign written 
in characters of gold. He offered as tribute a dress, and a cap 
ornamented with pearls, hundred and five hang of pearls and 
hundred pieces of ivory. This ambassador declared that many 
embassies which had left his country to go to China had been sur- 
prised by storms at sea, and had perished along with their goods. 
He showed a great desire to be able to advance right up to the 
base of the Imperial throne to perform there, with the pearls 
of the first choice, the ceremony called Sa-tien, 12 the greatest 
evidence of respect and attachment in his own view. The per- 
mission having been given him, he put his pearls on a silver tray 
which he raised above his head after kneeling down; then he 
spread them at the feet of the Emperor. This ambassador was 
called Pou-ya-toli. Honorary titles were given to him. 

In the tenth year hi-ning (1077) envoys of Tchu-iien appeared 
again at the court. They were twenty-seven in number. They 
offered pearls as big as peas, a big piece of lieou-li , camphor, the 
teeth of rhinoceros, beautiful textiles, incense, diverse perfumes, 
essence of roses, medicinal plants, borax and spices. The chief 
among them, having accomplished the ceremony of Sa-tien, the 
Emperor conferred on him a very high title and caused to be given 
to him precious medicines from the Imperial pharmacy. The other 
envoys were gratified with numerous presents, consisting above 
all of silks, and this embassy bore for the king of Tchu-lien 81,800 
strings of cash 13 with 52,000 taels of silver. 14 

In conclusion, if we wish to examine seriously all that is just 
related (according to the annals) on this kingdom of Tchu-lien, 
situated precisely at the distance of 411,400 li by sea from the port 
of Kouang-tcheou, the voyage to it requiring a navigation of 1,150 
days, one will scarcely find three facts meriting to be put beyond 
doubt: to know that Tchu-lien was a country very far from China, 
that it has never communicated with the Empire in olden days, 
and that it offered for the first time the tribute in the middle of 
the years ta-tchong~siang-fou. As to the letter of the king Lo-

Chau Ju-kua J s account (pp. 137-40 above) : 

NAN-PI 

This kingdom is to the . southwest. A month is needed to go 
there, setting out from San-fo-tsi, at a favourable time. There are 
always continual winds there. When the king wishes to go out, he 
sends in advance, a squad of more than hundred soldiers, under 
the direction of many officers, in order to water the ground and 
beat the dust on the road he is to traverse. The prince takes very 
choice food. He is served varied dishes by hundreds and (this 
happens) two times every day. One of the great dignitaries of the 
court has the high direction of his cuisines . 

The inhabitants of Nan-pi are very warlike. They manage 
skilfully the sabre and the lance. They are shrewd archers. They 
know to mint and strike silver coins with alloy which bear the 
royal seal of the State and which serve as currency for commerce. 
They fish for pearls and make cotton cloth of all colours. Because 
of its distance, this country lived without any relation with China, 
when two merchants who were natives of the land and who were 
called Chi-lo-pa-tchi-li-yu, father and son, came to establish 
themselves in the centre of the town of Tsiouen-tcheou (of Fo- 
kien). After this, many Chinese vessels took the route to Nan-pi 
in order to carry on trade.

IV. 

The following from Ibn Battuta should be read in continuation 
of XXX (B) at page 219: — 

Of the false rumour which was spread on the death of the Sultan , 
and the flight of the Malik Hoshang. 

As he returned to Daulat-a-bad, the sovereign was indisposed 
during the journey; the rumour ran among the people that he 
was dead. This news spread and was the cause of grave seditions. 
Malik Hoshang, son of Malik Kamal-u-din Gurg, was then at 
Daulat-a-bad, and he had promised to the Sultan never to take the 
oath of obedience to any other than himself as long as the Sultan 
should live and even after his death. When he heard of the death 
of the sovereign he fled to an infidel prince named Burabrah who 
lived in inaccessible mountains between Daulat-a-bad and Koaken 
Tanah. The monarch was informed of his flight, and as he suspected 
trouble, he hastened to reach Daulat-a-bad. He followed Hoshang 
in his track and surrounded him with cavalry. He sent word to 
the Hindu prince to surrender him; but the latter refused saying, 
“ I will not surrender my guest, not even when the consequence 
would be, as far as I am concerned, similar to what has happened 
to the king of Kanbilah.” However Hoshang was frightened about 
himself; he expedited a message to the Sultan, and they thought 
it expedient that the latter should return to Daulat-a-bad; that 
Qutlu KHan, the preceptor of the Sultan, should remain in order 
that Hoshang may receive some sureties from him and come to 
Qutlu KHan with a safe conduct. The Sultan left, and Hoshang 
conferred with the preceptor who promised him that the monarch 
would not kill him or lower his rank in any way. Then he set out 
with his goods, his family, his people and went to the Sultan ; the 
latter rejoiced at his arrival ; he clothed him with the robe of 
honour and thus gratified him.
