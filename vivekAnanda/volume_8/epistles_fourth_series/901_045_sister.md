*To Miss Mary Hale*  
(*Written on birch bark*)

PERCY N. H.,  
*17 June, 1895*.

DEAR SISTER,

Going tomorrow to the Thousand Islands care Miss Dutcher's, Thousand
Island Park, N.Y. Where are you now? Where will you all be in summer? I
have a chance of going to Europe in August, I will come to see you
before I go. So write to me. Also I expect books and letters from India.
Kindly send them care Miss Phillips, 19 W. 38th Street, N.Y. This is the
bark in which all holy writings are written in India. So I write
Sanskrit: May the husband of Uma (Shiva) protect you always.

May you all be blessed ever and ever.

VIVEKANANDA.
