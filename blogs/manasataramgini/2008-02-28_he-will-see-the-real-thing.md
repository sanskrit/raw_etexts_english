Mis-creant and we rode past the 7 betelnut trees that stood in a row on
our ashva-s. Beyond it was the realm of mR^ityu, where those dragged by
the dUta-s of vaivasvata were making their last journeys. Those 7
betelnut trees reminded us of the seven Sal trees that rAmachandra
aikshvAkava had pierced to prove to the kapIndra that he could slay
vAlin. My ashva was a slow one, while Mis-creant had a swift sapti, so
she briefly waited in the yonder ground for me to catch up. We were
alone in the ground by the river. On the other side of the river there
were some flickering flames of antyeShTI-s. She spelt out the
saMdhyopadesha:  
You shall have the mAyA,  
you shall have a 100 indrajAla-s,  
with it you shall make 100 loka-s  
with it you shall summon a 100 yakShinI-s  
He shall be filled with wonder,  
He shall behold the indrajAla-s,  
He will think the mAyA is all real \!  
The kavi shall have none of the mAyA,  
So how shall he survive?  
He will have one mantra,  
It will give him siddhi only once\!  
But with it he shall make real those lokas,  
Those which had sprung like maNi-s  
in the splendid indrajAla-s.  
For him send the spell of aryaman.
