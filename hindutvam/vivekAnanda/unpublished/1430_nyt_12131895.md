### (*New York Times* December 13, 1895)  PERSONALS

-- Swami Trigunatitananda, a brother Sanyasi of Swami Vivekananda, who
is now lecturing in New-York, undertook a few months ago a perilious
journey over the snowy ranges of the Himalayas, with a view of visiting
the shrines of Mount Kailas and lake Manaswarabara. He has now returned
to india, after an eventful journey. From what he has seen of Tibet and
of Tibetan monasteries, he has reason to believe that the discovery of
the Tibetan record of Christ’s life by the Russian traveler Notovitch,
regarded by many critics as a fake, is not without truth. He has seen
pictures of Christ in the monasteries, and says that Christ is regarded
by the Lamas as an Indian god.
