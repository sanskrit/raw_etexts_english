They do this the same to Hindus,and invent secular justifications for
this by funding various *malafide* NGOs and other places.(To see them in
action, see [@by2kaafi](https://twitter.com/by2kaafi) on Twitter). Here
it is the same case of the Mosaic distinction being turned onto other
groups seen as ‘less Christian’. However,since we are outrightly *not*
monotheists,the distinctions of *all* the children of Abraham will
always be against us.
