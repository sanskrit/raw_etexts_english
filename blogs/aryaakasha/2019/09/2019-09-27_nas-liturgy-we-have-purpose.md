Abridged commentary / explication –  
  
“

the line around Ratri and Aarti, for instance …  
Ratri means “Night”, “Darkness” … but also carries connotations of
“Wisdom”; and is more specifically also a reference to a) the Night
which precedes Creation, and b) the Goddess Who precedes , well,
everything happening.  
Aarti, by contrast, is etymologically derived from Ratri, in the sense
of ‘removing darkness’ via ‘illumination’, but also a) I am working with
the connotations which Flame carries within Vedic/Hindu metaphysics, of
Divinity, b) but *also* of Creation itself \[if you see a Nataraja Murti
of Lord Shiva, the reason why there’s a ‘ring of flames’ surrounding Him
is because it represents the unfolding and ‘in-process/in-progress’
universe\] , and the unfolding flow of ‘time’ \[‘time is the fire in
which we burn’, as the song/saying goes\] and c) ‘life’ in general.  
SO, without the black night that precedes Creation, and which underlies
and underpins it and bears all manner of secrets, and is also the
Goddess …  
… there can be no Light, no Creation, no life within it, no piety as
conduit back ‘up’  
  

I mean, as I suggested to Bruce upthread, the point of this is not ..
quite the same as my more detailed theological commentaries, wherein I
attempt to detailedly express somthing for \[relatively\] easier
comprehension.  
Rather, the purpose is to encourage contemplation and investigation by
the devotee … and alos, to communicate in a more … subtle way, some of
the truths in question.  
  

Now, with the *other* “Dark” “Light” one … this builds directly from the
previous – Without KAAL, there can be no SVAR  
“Kaal”, one of my favourite Sanskrit words … *can* mean Black, Dark
\[and, interestingly, Iron\] … and can also mean *Time* as well as
*Death*. And, of course, two deities – MahaKaal, MahaKali \[and, of
course, KaalBhairaivJi, BhadraKali, and so forth, in terms of aspects
and emanations thereof…\]  
SO, what I am saying here, is partially a restatement of the previous
line … without the Gods Who precede existence, in my Shakta-Shaivite
theological perspective, there can be no Svar.  
SVAR, here, I am being deliberately somewaht indistinct, as in Sanskrit,
the Svar which means ‘voice’ or ‘music’, is subtly different to the Svar
which means ‘Sun’, ‘Water’, ‘Light’ .. and underpins also “Heaven” –
Svar, although also in a more ‘defined’ sense, Svarga-Loka, Svarna , and
so forth. Svaraj, Rule by Heaven …  
Anyway, the point here is that ‘voice’ and ‘music’ as a cosmological,
cosmogonical principle – the unfolding unfurling of creation in a manner
not entirely unakin to Tolkien’s writing of same in the Silmarillion …
well, that precedes forth from Shiva & Shakti. And *also* expresses
Itself as Light, as Sound, coruscating and resounding through the
Heavens.  
  

But, you see, there are also those ‘deeper meanings’. ‘deepa meanings’
\[another pun – deepa is a devotional lamp, illumination\]  
As without the unfolding and on-running process of ‘time’, the Universe
cannot exist, except ‘statically’.  
But *also* on that other level … “Death” is necessary in order to
protect, uphold, and safeguard Creation.  
That is another of those mythological references – the assumption of
Kali, the Destroyer Form by the Goddess, in order to protect the Heavens
from Demonic onslaught.  
  

You see, part of my purpose in writing this , is to focus the mind and
remind us of our duty.  
So, the pious action in the first line, is the acknowledgement of Ratri,
but *also* the lighting and keeping of the Sacred Flames – the Conduit
up to the Divine.  
The pious action in the *second* line, well, it is the acknowledgement
of Death, and where necessary the bringing of it about \[c.f , in a
slightly different sense, the elements from Chapter 10 of the Bhagavad
Gita , around .. well .. you can look taht one up 😉 \]  
but also, the utilization of our Voices, our ‘Music’ to constantly
re-immanentize here in this universe, the Sacred, the Holy, the Pious;
keep attention also focused *up*, and that is what we are protecting.  
  

Vidyut, I am once more .. well, this picks up more directly from the
previous, as it refers to Light, to Lightening, to ‘Enlightenment’, you
might say. Lightning as a creative principle, guided by the illuminating
principle of wisdom – which ‘charges’ in that ‘electric’ manner …  
… Veda, here, i am deliberately beign a little indistinct with th
pun-value in Sanskrit, as ‘Veda’ would refer to knowledge, insight, the
acquisition of same .. whereas ‘Vedha’, wiht that sound-shift on the
last consonant, refers to the notion of Piety, of Faith – but also, to
the notion of Striking, of Penetrating.  
So here, we see that I am simultaneously recalling the Lightning Voice
of the Divine and Creation, *but also* the notion of the electrically
charged radiance of Divine Wisdom, and the *weaponized* qualities of
*both*, and the necessity of inquiry and even introspection, to get to
the heart of it.  
And, of course, “it’s also a spear”.  
So you can see, further, the nature and notion of both first and last
Sanskrit particle in that line – Vidyut and Ved(h)a – as a ‘call to
arms’. A reminder and a restatement of duty.  
  

Trishula is the Three-Spear, the Hindu iteration of Gungnir , and , you
know, the Lightning-Bolt/Bident/Trident of Zeus/Hades/Poseidon.  
It *also* represents the World-Tree, the Three Energises that
all-permeate the Universe, Mastery over the Three Worlds and therefore
the Universe Entire, and is the mightiest weapon in Creation , the Axis
Mundi about which all else turns \[c.f the Damaru about It, which is
beat to provide the rhythm of the dance of creation, unfolding, and
destruction, when the Trishula is rotated\].  
TriLoka in one sense refers to the Three Worlds .. although Loka also
means ‘sight’, so you can start to ‘see’ how broad this is.  
The idea being expressed here is, again, quite broad \[no Old Norse pun
initially intended .. but i like that enough that we’re keeping it!\]  
On one leel \[this is a typo that is now also a Sanskrit pun\], without
the World Tree, there cannot be .. well .. all that hangs off said
Tree.  
On another level, I am taking the ‘penetrating weapon’ of the previous
line, and pointing out that without the Weapon and Its Judicious
Employment, there cannot be the protection, preservation, and *literal
upholding* of the Universe Entire.  
On a third, I am once again recalling Shiva & Shakti as fundamental
precursors and Protectors, Empowerers \[Shakti\] an Lords over All of
Creation.  
\[master the three principles, attain the three worlds\]  
\[TriLochana Opens!\]  
  

Kritya, again has multiple meanings – but the main one here is the sense
of Action, Deed, Oath, Righteous Action, Pious, Proper Conduct.  
Kritya is also, of course, a GOddess of Destruction .. and you can see
how that relates to my previous utterances.  
Kripa, meanwhile, means several things – Divine Favour, a State of Grace
; but also, Tenderness, Compassion, even ‘Pity’, and Kindness.  
It also stands as an abbreviation for later ‘Krpana’ – a Sword, a
Dagger. You can see the martial symbolism that continues here. Without
the proper ‘motivation’ and guiding principle and ethos, there is not a
Divine Weapon of our intent, our will.  
Without pious conduct, how can one expect the stat of Divine Grace or
Favour?  
“Dharmo Rakshati Rakshitaha”  
  

Dharma-Yuddha, again, multiple shades of meaning .. but the most salient
one, perhaps, is the War-For-Righteousness, the War for the Fabric of
the Universe …  
… without which, there cannot be Righteous Rule/Order to the Universe,
Upheld. Dharma-Rajya.  
There is also a slightly more involved thought here around Dharma-Raja –
i.e. YAMA , “Death” , flowing both from War, and from the necessitous
engagement of Same, but we shall perhaps pick that up at some other time
once i’ve properly thought about it some more within the bounds of my
own mind.  
  

Now, ‘BhutAtman’, this is one of the most complex elements in the entire
piece.  
On one leel, Bhuta Atman would mean the Essence of Being, on another
level it refers to .. well .. existence, as in, one having an existence,
a ‘being’. On a third, the Essence of Existence, in both the individual
sense and the broader cosmological sense, and everything, all that is in
between, potentially.  
Moving further from the linguistics, you *could* render it in a more …
conventionally Hindu sense, as being that which one’s being/essence is
subsumed in, relating to Moksha, although also ‘going the other way’ to
the Universe.  
In either esense, it would also recall ISHVARA – God-Emperor, and thence
up to Brahman. And it is not coincidental that it can also most directly
refer to “Shiva”  
  

but part of th key sense via which i have intended it here – is that it
means “War’, ‘Conflict”.  
So you see, i am saying that , as the ‘capstone’ upon the recitation and
response of meditation upon PURPOSE ..  
.. without the PURPOSE , of the War-For-Existence, without the Universe,
and without Its Sovereign King:  
We would be Nothing –  
sans purpose, what is one  
without a stage upon which to exist, what is one  
without a lord \[and this is how the Germanic societal organization also
works, c.f The Wanderer poem\], what is one.
