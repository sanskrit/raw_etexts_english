title = "The eka-pa~nchAshan-nR^isiMha-nAmAni according to the kaula tradition"

+++
As per the shaiva tradition of the brahma-yAmala that expounds the lore
of kAplIsha bhairava and raktachAmuNDA, the sixth srotas is that of the
nR^isiMha tantra-s. Another tradition like that recorded by
abhinavagupta and jayaratha state this srotas was that of hATakeshvara.
Tradition holds that the homology of hATakeshvara with nR^isiMha was
expounded by the now lost AnandAdhikAra tantra. Further evidence for
this is suggested by the eka-pa\~nchAshan-nR^isiMha-nAmAni of the kAlI
kula. R1â€™s father stated that the yAga of nR^isiMha was expounded in one
of the khaNDa-s of the pa\~nchAshat sAhasryAM mahAkAla saMhitA that
still survived as a manuscript in kAThmANDU in his days. From memory I
think this paTala gave the same or similar set of 51 names as those
recorded in the nR^isiMha nyAsa of the kAmakalA-kAlI khaNDa of this
pa\~nchAshat sAhasryAM.

These 51 nR^isiMha-s are placed by the sAdhaka on his body as per the
usual practice of the 50-fold a\~Nga-nyAsa of Agamika tradition. Then he
meditates upon the 51 nR^isiMha-s as below, forming a circle around the
