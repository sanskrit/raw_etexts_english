## LVII

*To Mrs. Ole Bull*

NEW YORK

*The 28th May '95*

DEAR MOTHER,

Your last kind letter to hand. This week will be the last of my classes.
I am going next Tuesday with Mr. Leggett to Maine. He has a fine lake
and a forest there. I will be two or three weeks there.[1](#fn1) Thence
I go to the Thousand Islands. Also I have an invitation to speak at a
parliament of religions at Toronto, Canada, on July 18th. I will go
there from Thousand Islands and return back.

So far everything is going on well with me.

Ever your grateful son,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. My regards and love to your daughter and pray for her speedy
recovery.

V.
