The daNDaka kShuraka attack was made. That led to further trouble in the
troubled area. The oShadhi-vanaspati was ravaged- that brought the bank
balance down to zero. The dagda ratha caused havoc. An year after the
event there were only ruins. As we were passing by them we noticed the
passage of fate. The yakShiNi passed by but did not descend. Instead she
merely hovered around and said the following: 1) The death of the
foolish donkey with the leopard’s skin. 2) The bashing of the blue
jackal that howled on a new moon night.

Then she narrated this story: When indra slew vala with a blow from his
vajra he fell from the skies. The great serpent vAsuki pulled out his
gall bladder and was flying through the sky as though splitting the
welkin in two. He appeared like a bridge of silver across the sky
illumined by the gem in his head. Then garuDa attacked the sarpa as if
he may destroy heaven and earth. The mighty serpent to escape dropped
the gall bladder of the demon on the ridge of the mANikya mountain on
which turuShka trees which secrete copious resin grow. garuDa caught
some of the daitya’s bile from the but became unconscious due to it and
emitted it through his nostrils. vAyu pulled out the nails of vala and
threw them on clusters of lotuses. agni threw the blood of vala in the
low lying marshes of the narmada. The sarpa recovering grabbed the
intestines of the demon vala and deposited them in the chera country.
