A number of archaic altars shapes existed for the agnichayana of which
the practical geometric knowledge is largely lost in the surviving
shrauta tradition.

The most famous which are still performed are: 1) the broad winged
ShaDpatrika shyenachiti or the gliding eagle altar with 6 feathered
wings. There is a variant of this with wings entirely made of 6 rows of
parallelogram bricks.  
2\) the drawn wing pa\~Nchapatrika shyenachiti or the diving eagle altar
with 5 feathered wings.  
3\) The pIthachiti- In the form a square with 3 rectangular paths
leading out on 3 of the sides (this is nearly extinct, only a single
Andhra ritualist, whose patnI is also a qualified soma ritualist, knows
this.  
4\) The puruShachiti- in the form of a standing man with arms extended
to the sides.  
5\) The kUrmachiti- in the form of a turtle

The less known ones:  
6\) The ka\~nkachiti- in the form of a flying heron  
7\) The alajachiti- in the form of an alaja bird with four furrow like
paths leading out in the cardinal directions.  
8\) praugachiti- in the form of an equilateral triangle  
9\) droNachiti- in the form of a droNa kalasha  
10\) rathachakrachiti- in the form of a spoked wheel  
11\) parichAyyaM- a circular altar  
12\) shmashAnachiti- in the form resembling a tomb (shmashAna described
in the yajurvedic burial rite for the bones of a dead clansman)

All the altars have 5 layers of bricks.
