The 3rd stride of viShNu as well as his snake is the enduring Hindus
symbol of the axis that precesses with the passage of kAla or time.
Right from the R^igveda this axial role of viShNu is at the fore in all
conceptions of him. We have alluded to this a few times before, see:
[snake of
viShNu](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/06/the-snake-of-vishnu/),
[the Finnish
epic](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/05/the-finnish-epic/),
and more obliquely in [fall of
praHlAda](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/07/the-fall-of-prahlada/).
The element of the axis and its precession is very much a part of the
“core mythology” of viShNu: 1) the horn of matsya- the new axis being
provided for the world after its shift due to precession. 2) The mandAra
mountain as the staff for the churning of the world ocean being borne by
viShNu on his back in the form of kUrma. 3) varAha raising the “world
plane” with his tusks- the world plane being the equatorial circle
intersecting the ecliptic. It had sunk because the precession had pushed
the old intersection with the ecliptic below the plane. 4) nR^isimha
emerging by shattering the pillar- the old axis is broken by the flow of
time by precession. 5) trivikrama with his three steps stabilizes the
new world plane (equatorial circle), the ecliptic’s high point (step 2)
and the precessing axis (step 3). It is in this context that the great
R^ikSha jAmbavant is described as circumambulating trivikrama as he took
his great strides. This represents the new axis being established and
the constellation of the Great Bear (represented as the bear jAmbavant)
making a circle of the north celestial pole. Indeed viShNu himself is
identified with the constellation of the shishumAra or Draco associated
with the old north pole from earlier period of Aryan memory.  As the
knowledge of precession is very subtle (even alluded in the opening of
the maitrayaNi brAhmaNa fragment by shAkAyanya who was well aware of
these matters) the third step of viShNu is secret and was only know to
the great kavi-s.

In Indian architecture its depicted more directly on many occasions, but
more subtly in the great iron pillar of the guptas. Before the iron
pillar was uprooted by the Mohammedans and placed in the vicinity of
their giant phallic signpost at Delhi, it graced the now derilict Hindu
astronomical observatory at the viShNupAda-giri in the udayagiri
complex. The iron pillar (as shown by Balasubramanian) was graced by a
nakShatra-chakra on the top and was known as the viShNu dhvaja–
depicting the great axis in front of the observatory located atop the
hill. Thus, in the immortal pillar did chandragupta II vikramAditya, one
of the greatest rulers of bhArata commemorate the step of viShNu and and
world axis.

This was also very much in the mind of daNDin when he composed his pUrva
pIThikA:

The rod of the umbrella cap of the universe,  
the reed stock for the lotus seat of the one of 100 sacrifices,  
the mast rod of the ship that is the earth  
the rod for banner, that is the heavenly stream (the Milky Way),  
the axis of the rotating star-wheel,  
the rod that is the victory pillar of the 3 worlds, may the foot \[of
viShNu\] favor you,  
the rod that is the leg of trivikrama with which he strode to conquer
the 3 worlds,  
is the rod of time (death) to the enemies of the devas.

Recall the R^igveda: atha abravId vR^itraM indro haniShyan | sakhe
viShNo vitaraM vi kramasva ||

Indra spoke as he set out to slay vitra: “friend viShNu stride widely”.
In the Germanic world likewise we have the cognate of viShNu, viDAr
(=vitaraM; compare with viShNu=wide) taking his 3 steps before killing
the Fenris wolf and the time of the world-end chaos or the rAgnarok.
daNDin of Kanchipuram was remembering a very ancient motif and artfully
weaving his own name into the pUrvapIThikA of dasha-kumAra-charitra, a
literary work beyond compare. The whole work does not survive in its
original. While I am told a medieval Telugu translation was made I am
not much aware of it to say if it preserves more of the original.
