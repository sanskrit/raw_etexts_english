## EDUCATION

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 4, p. 157.)

\[*Daily Chronicle*, May 14, 1896\]

The Sesame Club. — At a meeting of the Sesame Club on Tuesday night
\[May 12\], the chairman, Mr. Ashton Jonson, said he regretted to
announce that Mrs. Norman was too unwell to be present to open, as
announced, a debate on "Should we return to the land." An address was
accordingly given by Swami Vivekananda on the subject of education,
(There is no verbatim transcript available. Cf. the Indian newspaper
report ["On
Education"](../part_iii_indian_newspaper_reports/10_the_indian_mirror_jun_19_1896.htm),
p. 535 .) in which he urged that no one could obtain intellectual
greatness until he was physically pure. Morality gave strength; the
immoral were always weak, and could never raise themselves
intellectually, much less spiritually. Directly \[as\] immorality began
to enter the national life its foundations commenced to rot. As the life
blood of every nation was to be found in the schools, where boys and
girls were receiving their education, it was absolutely essential that
the young students should be pure, and this purity must be taught them.
