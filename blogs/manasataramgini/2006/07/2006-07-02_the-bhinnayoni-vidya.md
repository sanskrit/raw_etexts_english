title = "The bhinnayoni vidyA"

+++
Since I was asked of the famed bhinna yoni vidyA, which powers the mahA
mAtR^ikA nyAsa I have written it down. Of course its prakaTa as
pratya\~NgirA needs the inter-twining with the atharvamukha, of which
the bhinna yoni is itself a prakaTa rUpa. Its manifestation as
parameshvarI is can be seen in the stand alone bhinna yoni vidyA, though
a practioner of the bhrigu-A\~Ngirasa shruti notes the deep concordance
with the atharvamukha constantly. Its manifestation as mAlinI, as stated
from the mouth of trishiro-bhairava is in the form of the mahordhva
li\~Nga and the laghu-yoni. “Oh girl of pretty hips, whose firm breasts
are the mounds of manmatha-kalA, how many shrikaNThas and shiva-yuvati-s
manifest when we triangulate the great upward li\~Nga with 3 equal
sides, 6-fold times ? There is one more shiva-yuvati than those of the
shrikaNThas. He who knows this knows the vidyA”

Of course any one trying to make use of the mahAmantra given below
without the rahasya yoginI-s goes no where.

The dUtI-s of the nAdi vidya are conjoined with the rudra-s of
shabdarAshI.
