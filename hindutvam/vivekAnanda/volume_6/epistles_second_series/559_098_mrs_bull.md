## XCVIII

63 ST. GEORGE'S ROAD, LONDON,  
*30th May, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

. . . Day before yesterday I had a fine visit with Prof. Max Müller. He
is a saintly man and looks like a young man in spite of his seventy
years, and his face is without a wrinkle. I wish I had half his love for
India and Vedanta. At the same time he is a friend of Yoga too and
believes in it. Only he has no patience with humbugs.

Above all, his reverence for Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is extreme, and he
has written an article on him for the *Nineteenth Century*. He asked me,
"What are you doing to make him known to the world?" Ramakrishna has
charmed him for years. Is it not good news? . . .

Things are going on here slowly but steadily. I am to begin from next
Sunday my public lectures.

Yours ever in grateful affection,

VIVEKANANDA.
