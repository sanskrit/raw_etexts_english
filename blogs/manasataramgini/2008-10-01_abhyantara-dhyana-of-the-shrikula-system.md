With a body of the form of a lightning streak, constituted of the sun,
the moon and fire, verily seated above the six lotuses is your kalA.
Roving in the great lotus with minds having suppressed the filth and
delusion the great ones who see \[you\] obtain the wave of the highest
bliss.  
Series of successive dissolutions goes thus:  
ka â€“ viShu; e- mUlAdhAra; i- maNipUra; la-svAdiShThAna; hrIM-anAhata;
ha-vishuddhi; sa-lambikAgra; ka-Aj\~nA; ha-indu; la-ardhachandra;
hrIM-rodhinI; sa-nAda; ka-nAdAnta; la-shakti;
hrIM-vyApikA-\>samAnA-\>unmanA-\>kulapadma  
The dissolution of the final syllable of the kula-vidyA occurs in a
triangular yoni with its vertices marked by sUrya, agni and soma in the
vyApikA. The sUrya then dissolves into the agni in the samAnA, then agni
dissolves in to soma in the samAnA, then soma dissolves into the
lightning-like parA-kalA in the unmanA. When all are dissolved the yogin
realizes the conjoining of kaulini with akulavIra in the kulapadma.

The one who understands this realizes why the pa\~nchadashAkSharI was a
major discovery by the yogin-s within the shrIkula system that
represented a new development beyond the ancestral system of bAlA. Of
course, within the shrIkula system there was another parallel system,
namely that of tripura-bhairavI that represents another distinct path of
discovery.
