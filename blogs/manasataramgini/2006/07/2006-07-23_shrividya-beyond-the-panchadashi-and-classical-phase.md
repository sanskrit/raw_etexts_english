Not much is remembered of the shrI-kula traditions before the universal
sweep by the pa\~nchadashI and structurally related mantras, like manu
vidyA or skanda vidyA. These may be termed the classical shrIvidyA
mantras and examples include:  

## The manmatha vidyA or kAdi vidyA:  

ka e I la hrIm | ha sa ka ha la hrIm | sa ka la hrIM  

This celebrated mantra is seen even in tiru-mantiraM of sundaranAtha
(tirumUlar) the celebrated siddha who migrated from Kashmir to the
drAviDa desha.  

## The lopAmudra vidyA or the hAdi vidyA:  

ha sa ka la hrIm | ha sa ka ha la hrIm | sa ka la hrIM  

## The skanda vidyA (with 18 syllables):  
ha sa ka la hrIm | ha sa ka sa ka la hrIm | sa ha ka ha ka hrIm |  

## The manu vidyA (with 18 syllables):  
ka ha e I la hrIm | ha ka e I la hrIm | sa ka e I la hrIM  

Now even within the classic mantras mainly the kAdimata and to a smaller
extant the hAdimata dominate.

However, there are two independent mantras of shrIkula that appear to
have existed as parallel shrIvidyA traditions before the
pa\~nchadashI-like formulae became universal. Only fragments of these
texts now survive giving the minimal sketch of mantraic deployment. One
of them appears to parallel the archaic kubjikA tradition, where the
mantras are combined with five vaktra mantras for shiva. This is also
called the nityaklinnA vidyA. The second appears to be a stand alone
form of tripurasundarI. While in both these versions the 8 bhairavas are
present, not all of the 16 nityA-s are invoked (at least in the
surviving fragments). vArAhI (danDanathA) is however worshipped as in
the pa\~chadashi based forms.

It appears that sundaranAtha (tirumUlar) appears to have been aware of
these parallel forms as he mentions a shakti-pIThaM tripurA chakra,
which from the sketchy details seems to be chakra that goes along with
the above version.
