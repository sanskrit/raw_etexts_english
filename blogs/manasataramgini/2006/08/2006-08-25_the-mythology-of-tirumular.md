title = "The mythology of tirumUlar"

+++
It is clear from tirumantiram verses 337 onwards that tirumUlar was an
extreme sectarian shaiva. He cites several elements of shaiva mythology,
where the aim is plainly to show the supremacy of shiva over other gods.
He also sees a sadashiva higher than rudra in his world view, which is
typical of this stream of thought and the sectarian shAktas further go
on to subsume the five brahma, viShNu, rudra, mahesha and sadAshiva as
the 5 pretas forming the cot of the transfunctional shaktI.

The sectarian elements apart, it is useful to compare the shiva purANa
with tirumUlar’s mythology to identify the pan-Indian elements of shaiva
mythology. The deeds of shiva are:  
1\) shiva sends agastya to correct the “balance” of the earth (the
ancient astronomical myth of axial precession, is uniquely incorporated
here into shaiva mythology)  
2\) The killing of Andhaka\*  
3\) The beheading of dakSha and his head replacement.\*  
4\) Cutting of brahma’s head and drinking of viShNu’s blood.\*  
5\) Killing jalandhara with the chakra made from his toe\*  
6\) Destruction of the tripura-s\*  
7\) Killing of gajAsura\*  
8\) The burning of yama (this is described as the yogic kuNDalini fire
arising from the mUlAdhAra and shooting out through the sahasrAra to
burn yama) (?)  
9\) Killing of kAma\*  
10\) The winning of pArvatI from himavAn\*  
11\) destruction of tripura-s again (mentioned further too)\*  
12\) The pillar of fire and the quest of its ends by brahmA and viShNu
and the giving of the chakra and sword to viShNu and brahmA
respectively\*  
13\) rAvaNa being granted boons\*  
14\) chanDeshvara raised to gaNa status for cutting his father’s leg for
having performed shiva-ninda\*  
15\) routing the other gods during the destruction of the sacrifice of
dakSha\*  
16\) He split the chakra of viShNu into 3 parts and gave one part back
to viShNu, one to his wife and one he wore a cresent ornament  
17\) He suppressed the sea as the equine fire\*

The majority of these myths are seen in the main sanskrit mythological
traditions of shiva namely the shiva purANa and the skAnda purAna. A few
tales of rudra find mention in the veda like the destruction of the
tripura-s, the killing of Andhaka, the killing of prajApati/brahma, the
destruction of the sacrifice. This suggests that rudra had a rich
mythology right from the ancient past, like indra. The presence of most
major elements in both the northern and southern traditions suggests
that there was core pan-Indian shiva purANa with several major tales
(marked \*) that had spread widely. The core shiva purANa seems to have
been shared by both the mantra mArga and lAkulIsha pAshupatas, but the
extant version of the shiva purANa seems to have been mainly preserved
by the lAkulIshas rather than the mantra marga shaivas. The core shiva
purANa set in stone in the “Elephanta caves” around 550-600 CE, which is
approximately contemporaneous with tirumular, suggesting that the core
shiva purANa text encompassing the tales of shiva were in place well
before this period.
