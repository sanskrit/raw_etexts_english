## CXXXIV

(*Translated from [Bengali](b7370e6134.pdf)* )

*1897.*

DEAR MOTHER, (Shrimati Indumati Mitra)

Please be not anxious because I could not write to you and could not go
to Belgaon. I was suffering very much from illness and it was impossible
for me to go then. Now thanks to my travels in the Himalayas, I have
greatly regained my health. I shall soon resume work. In two weeks I am
going to the Punjab, and just after delivering a lecture or two at
Lahore and Amritsar, I shall start via Karachi for Gujarat, Cutch, etc.
I shall surely see you at Karachi.

This Kashmir is a veritable heaven on earth. Nowhere else in the world
is such a country as this. Mountains and rivers, trees and plants, men
and women, beasts and birds — all vie with one another for excellence. I
feel a pang at heart not to have visited it so long. Please write to me
in detail how you are doing, mentally and physically, and accept my
special blessings. I am constantly having your welfare at heart, know
this for certain. 

Yours sincerely,

VIVEKANANDA.
