The famous poet, mayUra of harShavardhana’s court, whose shR^i\~NgAra
work, the mayUrAShTaka, we had earlier alluded is supposed to have
composed the sUryashataka in the aftermath of the events following the
former composition.

sUryashataka-1  
jaMbhArAtiibha-kumbhodbhavaM iva dadhataH sAndra-sindUra-reNuM  
raktAH siktA ivaaughair udaya-giri-taTI-dhAtu-dhArAdravasya  
AyAntyA tulyakAlaM kamala-vana-ruchevA .aruNA vo vibhUtyai  
bhUyAsur bhAsayanto bhuvanam abhinavA bhAnavo bhAnavIyAH ||

The imagery of the first simile with which the work opens puzzles me
somewhat: I take the sindhUra reNu=scarlet dust i.e. an allusion to the
dust motes in the rising sunbeams, which are likely to appear scarlet.
Now they are described as sAndra, which in this context I mean to take
wet. They are described as being on the frontal domes of the elephant of
indra. So I took this to mean the mud bath that elephants take by
spraying the mud from their trunks on to their heads. So it might seem
that mayUra sees the spray of mud by the elephant onto its frontal domes
as the motes in the sunbeams. I am not entirely sure of this simile
though. The second simile is of streams of sprinkled blood flowing down
the slopes of udaya-giri-like molten metal streams. The third simile
compares the crimson luster of the rising sun with a water-lily
conglomeration’s glow, and states that the rays are simultaneous with
the rising. While I ignored my lessons in saMskR^ita, especially
pertaining to kAvya, a word called utprekShA filtered in from somewhere.
I guess this richly illustrates that utprekSha – the synaesthetic
tendencies of the poet.

sUryashataka-26  
bibhrANaH shaktim Ashu prashamita-balavat-tArakaaurjityag-urvIM  
kurvANo lIlayA .andhaH shikhinam api lasach-chandra-kAntAvabhAsaM  
AdadhyAd andhakAre ratim atishayinIm Avahan vIkShaNAnAM  
bAlo lakShmIm apArAM apara iva guho .aharpater Atapo vaH ||

This is a famous example of what the Hindus of yore called the shleSha
or paronomasia. The sentences are supposed to simultaneous refer to both
sUrya and kumAra. We can work it out as below (given my kaumAra
predilection unlike my father’s saura one, I give the kaumAra form
first):  
kumAra: Bearing a weighty shakti that instantly suppresses the might of
the powerful tAraka /  
sUrya: Bearing the strong energy that instantly suppresses the shine of
the stars;  
kumAra: sportingly riding atop a peacock which verily flashes the
moon-shaped \[tail spots\]/  
sUrya:Effortlessly drowning the fire\[‘s illumination\] and verily the
flashing glow of he moon;  
kumAra: bears immense pleasure to the eyes of the andhaka’s enemy/  
sUrya: bears immense pleasure to the eyes given to darkness;  
The young rays of the sun, like a second guha, conveys unlimited
prosperity/  
The young guha like a second sun’s rays conveys unlimited prosperity.

The sUrya shataka is one of those saura works from the classical Indian
saura tradition, the evolution of whose tAntrika forms we shall consider
in due course. A rough outline of the evolutionary scenario of the saura
mata is presented here.
