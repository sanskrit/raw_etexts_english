## LI

*To Mr. E. T. Sturdy*

C/O MISS MACLEOD,  
HOTEL HOLLANDE,  
RUE DE LA PAIX,  
PARIS,  
*5th September, 1895*.

DEAR AND BLESSED FRIEND,

It is useless to express my gratitude for your kindness; it is too great
for expression. . . .

I have a cordial invitation from Miss Müller, and as her place is very
near to yours, I think it will be nice to come to her place first for a
day or two and then to come over to you.

My body was very ill for a few days, which caused this delay in writing
you.

Hoping soon for the privilege of mingling hearts and heads together.

I remain, ever yours in love, and fellowship in the Lord, 

VIVEKANANDA.
