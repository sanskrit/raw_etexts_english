The amAtya’s spells had provided a temporary respite by completely
smothering the sapatna’s fury. But finally the amAtya’s charms were
broken by the counter-attack and the sapatna advanced right to our most
critical fort. We felt that the capital could last only a matter of days
in the worst case and we were also besieged by an army of mlechChas. We
had gathered our last reserves in our defensive line of forts for the
long struggle and then decided to make a surprise sally on the mlechCha
as soon as the first chance availed itself and tried to break past their
cordon to reach the defensive forts.
