<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">The Child Education</p>
<p class="Text">By the inspiration of the friends in the interest of the boys something about their duties is being written here. This should be kept in mind that so long as the mother, father, preceptor are alive or they are ignorant of what are their duties and what is improper for them, despite being older in age, they are yet a child. Special attention should be paid on learning in the boyhood; because in the grown up age the practice of knowledge is very difficult. The boy who doesn’t make the practice of knowledge in his boyhood, has to repent forever later on. But this should be kept in mind that along with the worldly knowledge and the modern education, there is a great need of moral, ethical and religious knowledge also. Without the religious education human life is not better than the animal’s life. Due to being empty of religious knowledge, the boys today are  proceeding towards self-willed generally. They have now become the victim of despotism, self-willed, perversity, addiction to any vice, untruthfulness, deceit, theft, wenching, laziness, intoxication etc., so many vices and demerits which is ruining their divine world and  this world both.</p>
<p class="Text">The western language, dress, civilization have become their choice and in the sacrificing characters of the sages, righteousness and God they feel compunction. This is all the impact of western culture and education. </p>
<p class="Text">I don’t mean to say that the Western education should not be imparted and then the practice of Western knowledge should be made. Although the use of poison is to invite death but just as that same poison if taken after the moderation by the medicines or with the herbal medicines becomes fruitful like nectar. Similarly, we should practise the Western knowledge also beside our religious knowledge or after the moderation by our religion.</p>
<p class="Text">Because, it is only the religion which is the life, soul and the source of salvation in this world and the next world both. It is only the ‘Dharma’ (religion) that accompanies in the next world. Wife, son and all the kith and kin cannot help us there after death. So, for the self redemption the mankind as a whole should collect righteousness. Now this is the point of discussion before us what is that object of religion worth assuming for us?</p>
<p class="Text">The sages have explained the religion by the name of virtues and noble conduct. The Lord has said something about religion by the name of the divine property in the 16th chapter and in the 17th chapter by the name of ‘penance’ in the <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span> and whatever He has said that is the explanation of religion. In the second stanza of ‘Yogadarshana’ Patanjali has given the explanation of the same religion by the name ‘Yama-Niyama’ in the form of restraints and observances and Manuji has also mentioned ten characteristics of ‘Dharma’ (religion) in brief in 6/92. Having the consideration of all this, it is proved that the name of ‘virtues’ and ‘moral conduct’ is Dharma (religion).</p>
<p class="Text">The conduct what is beneficial for the self and for the whole world rather to say that the noble deeds done with mind, speech and body, is called ‘moral conduct’ and the pious feelings of innerself are called ‘virtues’. </p>
<p class="Text">Now, the question arises how to attain the righteousness? Its answer may be that the company of the virtuous persons can provide this righteousness. Because Veda, Smriti, moral conduct and the self good inclination in result-these four are the main apparent characteristics of ‘Dharma’ (religion). Manuji has also supported the same explanation of religion—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">वेदः स्मृतिः सदाचारः स्वस्य च प्रियमात्मनः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">एतच्चतुर्विधं प्राहुः साक्षाद्धर्मस्य लक्षणम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/12)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Veda, Smriti, moral conduct and helpful in the result of the self well-being are the four characteristics of righteousness.’</p>
<p class="Text">There can be the union of all the four by the  association of virtuous persons only. In the situation of their mutual contradiction the true decision is possible only by the assembly of saints. So, the company of the virtuous men should be attended. It should remain in the mind that the same explanation of religion as mentioned in the Vedas-Smriti is there in the History and ‘Puranas’ also. So, the teachings given therein are also ‘Dharma’ (religion).</p>
<p class="Text">So, it is proper for the mankind not to give up the piety even when there is the risk of life; he should give up the life for the cause of piety; because he who dies for the cause of righteousness, gets the supreme position. The sons of Guru Govind Singh attained the supreme position and the everlasting glory by sacrificing their lives. Manuji has also said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">श्रुतिस्मृत्युदितं धर्ममनुतिष्ठन्हि मानवः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">इह कीर्तिमवाप्नोति प्रेत्य चानुत्तमं सुखम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/9)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The man who follows the religion according to the ordains of Vedas and Smriti, is glorified in this world and after death gets the eternal joy tin the form of God-realisation.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, O boys! You should pay special attention to the words which are the most useful for you. Usually, there are so many teachings but there are six lessons written as follows need specific effort to follow them considering them like life and soul.</p>
<p class="Text">These are the points—</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">To follow the path of moral conduct, to be self-restraint and follow the life of celibacy, the practice of learning, the service of mother-father and preceptor and the Lord’s-devotion etc.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Moral Conduct</p>
<p class="Text">The fulfilment of all the actions according to the Shastras is virtuous conduct. By this justification self-control, to follow celibacy in life, the practice of learning, the service of mother-father and the preceptors and the Lord’s devotion etc., are considered to be the virtuous conduct according to the rules of Shastras. But these are only the main points. So, in the welfare  of the students it few is being discussed here in some detail separately. Besides them there are other more useful lessons for the students out of which some are being described here in the name of virtuous conduct.</p>
<p class="Text">Boys should pay their attention first to their conduct because all the religions are created from the conduct. Bhishma has said in the 149th chapter of ‘<span class="char-style-override-1">Anushasana Parva</span>’ of ‘<span class="char-style-override-1">Mahabharata</span>’—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सर्वागमानामाचारः प्रथमं परिकल्पते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">आचारप्रभवो धर्मो धर्मस्य प्रभुरच्युतः॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘In all the Shastras first Dharma of all noble  conduct is considered, the piety emerges from conduct and the Lord of ‘Dharma’ (religion) is the Lord Shri 'Achyuta’. </p>
<p class="Text">There are mainly two parts of conduct the purificatory after ablution and the virtuous conduct. To maintain the cleanliness of body and food, clothes, the house and the utensils etc; with water and earth etc., according to the rules of Shastras is called the conduct of purification.</p>
<p class="Text">To give the due treatment to all and to perform the noble conduct in accordance with the Shastras is virtuous conduct. Because of this the evil and vices having been destroyed, there comes the internal and external purity and there is the emergence of virtues. </p>
<p class="Text">First of all having got up early in the morning before sun-rise, the purification after ablution should be made and bath* should be taken. Then, after completing the works of daily routine the elders feet should be saluted. After this for the sound health and the growth of the vitality ‘Pashchimottana’ ‘Shirshasana’ ‘Viparitikarana’ etc., Yogic exercises and the physical exercises should be practised. Then, after taking the meal the study should be made. If there is the interest in the practice of Yogic and physical exercises in the evening also the practice of study should be made without taking milk.</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* After the excretion of faeces the anus should be cleaned thrice with the earth mixed water, then again it should be washed with water only till there is foul smell and greasiness. After the excretion of faeces or urine the genital organs also should be washed with water. After the excretion of faeces the left hands should be washed ten times with earth, both the hands should joining together should be washed seven times with water and earth, the feet should be washed once with earth and water and the pot be washed thrice. After washing the hands and feet and after cleaning all the holes of the face and brushing the teeth with the twig of Neem, the mouth should be cleaned. Twelve gargles with water should be done.</p>
<p class="Text">After the study, in the 2nd half of the day at the right time after having a sip of water the simple and pure meal should be taken very carefully.</p>
<p class="Text">There should be always in the mind never to make over eating—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">उपस्पृश्य द्विजो नित्यमन्नमद्यात्समाहितः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">भुक्त्वा चोपस्पृशेत्सम्यगद्भिः खानि च संस्पृशेत् ॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/53)</p>
<p class="Text">‘A  twice-born Brahman should always take his meal very carefully only after having a sip of water and he should have a sip of water very well even after taking  his meal and should touch the six holes of the face (nose, ear, and eyes) with water.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">पूजयेदशनं नित्यमद्याच्चैतदकुत्सयन्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">दृष्ट्वा हृष्येत्प्रसीदेच्च प्रतिनन्देच्च सर्वशः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/54)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Give respect to the food and without any condemnation take the meal and express your pleasure being pleased to see it and felicitate it by all means.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">पूजितं ह्यशनं नित्यं बलमूर्जं च यच्छति। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अपूजितं तु तद्‍भुक्तमुभयं नाशयेदिदम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/55)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Because the meal taken with respect, gives us vigour and increases our semens and the food taken unwillingly with disrespect, decays the both.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अनारोग्यमनायुष्यमस्वयं चातिभोजनम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अपुण्यं लोकविद्विष्टं तस्मात्तत्परिवर्जयेत्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/57)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Over-eating destroys our health, age, heaven and the virtuous deeds and it is the act of public slander; so abandon it.’</p>
<p class="Text">After taking meal one should not sleep in the day and should not move on the way. The practice of learning should also be made after one hour. After the practice of learning in the evening again after the purification from the ablution and bath, the work of daily routine should be done. Then again after taking meal in the night after some time when the second watch in the night begins, one should go to sleep. The boys should sleep at least for seven hours. If the sun rises before the rise from the sleep ‘Gayatri-Mantra’ should be muttered the whole day and the fast should be kept on. Manuji has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तं चेदभ्युदियात्सूर्यः शयानं कामचारतः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">निम्लोचेद्वाप्यविज्ञानाजपन्नुपवसेद्दिनम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/220)</p>
<p class="Text">‘While sleeping willingly if the sun rises and similarly sets by mistake, one should keep the fast and pass the whole day in the muttering of ‘Gayatri mantra’.</p>
<p class="SHLOK">सूर्येण ह्यभिनिर्मुक्तः शयानोऽभ्युदितश्च यः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रायश्चित्तमकुर्वाणो युक्तः स्यान्महतैनसा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/221)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The celibate who is in sleep and the sun rises or sets, does not atone for it, he has to suffer a great sin.’</p>
<p class="Text">In daily routine the muttering of the Lord’s Name, meditation and the recitation of at least one chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span> at least must be done. For Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya—he must offer oblation to fire, he must mutter the ‘Gayatri-spell’, practise self-study, worship the gods and offer water to his ancestors also. Even among these performances he must observe at least the practice of ‘Sandhya’ and ‘Gayatri’. If he fails to observe so he becomes the victim of attonement and he is considered the meanest one. For a celibate there is never impurity caused by the birth of the child in a family; but ther is no objection to anyone in the fulfilment of the daily routine.* </p>
<p class="xfootnote">* In the impurity caused by the birth or death the vedic daily routine should be performed by the pronunciation of the spells in mind without water. The water should be offered to the Sun only.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-4">So, the works of daily routine must be formed. Manuji has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">नित्यं स्नात्वा शुचिः कुर्याद‍् देवर्षिपितृतर्पणम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">देवताभ्यर्चनं चैव समिदाधानमेव च॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/176</p>
<p class="Text">‘After bath and having been purified daily, a celibate must offer water to the god, sage and ancestors and worship the gods and must offer oblation to fire.’</p>

<p class="SHLOK">स शूद्रवद‍् बहिष्कार्यः सर्वस्माद् द्विजकर्मणः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/103)</p>
<p class="Text">‘He, who does not perform the practice of ‘Sandhyopasana’ either in the morning or in the evening, deserves to be deprived of all the functions of a Brahman like one of lower caste.’</p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/106)</p>
<p class="Text">‘There is no off day in the functioning of daily routine works; because it has been called ‘Brahmayagya’. In the Vedas and Smriti a great efficacy of the ‘Gayatri Japa’ has been described. The muttering of the ‘Gayatri-spell’ should be performed only after being purified after taking bath on and not while move. By the practice of one thousand Japa of ‘Gayatri’ everyday, man gets rid of his all the sins within a month. By the practice of three years, the Supreme Brahm is attained to him as has been said by Manu—</p>

<p class="Text">‘The man who giving up laziness repeats ‘Gayatri’ daily regularly for three years with its meditated knowledge attains, Supreme ‘Brahma’ assuming the form of air and space.’</p>
<p class="Text">But it should be kept in mind—No talk of the Kshatriya and Vaishya is a far-fetched affair, even the Brahmans should not practice of the Vedas, the offering of oblation to the fire as mentioned in the Vedas and ‘Sandhya’ and the muttering of ‘Gayatri’ spell before the investiture of ‘sacred thread ceremony’; because without the investiture of ‘sacred-thread’ they are also not entitled of these pious deeds. If they do so, they become the victim of atonement. So it is must for the Brahmans, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas to be invested with for sacred thread. If they have come in the category of the fallen down* even then according to the rules of Shastras, after atoning, they should get invested with the sacred thread. </p>

<p class="Text">After explaining the time and ceremonial function of the sacred thread for the above three castes now it is being described here about their conduct.</p>
<p class="Text">O boys! ‘love’ is the highest quality in this world, ‘love’ is the embodiment of the Supreme Being, so where there is love there is the empire of happiness and peace. That love generates by giving comfort to others soul with unselfish motive. What to talk about mother, father, preceptor and class fellows, by speaking the truthful, helpful, humble words and giving each and everyone comfort with your mind, speech and body and by any means to others that may be beneficial to others such effort ought to be made by you.</p>
<p class="Text">No question of to steal, to grab and to take the objects of others  forcefully, if they give consently, even then not to accept it in your self-interest they should be made contented with pleasant and humble words, if they feel sad in your refusal and obstacle is foreseen in the love, then, if it is accepted, is nothing wrong.</p>
<p class="Text">Ignoring the faults of others, their virtues should be inculcated. Let not others be condemned or there should not be backbiting at all, it is in the interest of none. If needed the true appreciation may be made. </p>
<p class="Text">No longing for honour, praise, repute, respect should be ever hatched in the mind but contrary to it if it is thurst upon even then on account of being hurdle in the redemption it should not be acceptd mentally but sorrow or hesitation should be felt.</p>
<p class="Text">You should feel joy in getting even the objects unfavourable to you by the others will or the God’s will considering it the reward sent by God. If it may not be possible, it is proper to take it as the result of your sin. </p>
<p class="Text">All the commands of the elders are worth obeying but there can be the abstinence in obeying that which may be harmful to them or others or which may create a great obstacle in the Lord’s devotion.</p>
<p class="Text">Never get yourself involved in the worthless arguments and dispute with anyone what to talk of the preceptor?</p>
<p class="Text">The adversities and calamity to any extent may fall upon but you should bear it with fortitude and fearlessness because by the tolerance of the most adverse hardships our self-strength develops, considering so you should not lose your patience and piety even in the adverse situations.</p>
<p class="Text">No egotism or arrogance should overpower your mind after doing noble deed. But on the gain of wealth, knowledge, vigour, power and prosperity etc., the feeling of egotism, arrogance, vanity take the seat in our mind, it is but natural but taking it as death our behaviour with others should be humble and very polite, Thus, by doing so the evils can not approach us.</p>
<p class="Text">The time must be spared for the contemplation about the religious books like <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span> and <span class="char-style-override-1">Ramayana</span> with love and devotion.</p>
<p class="Text">By the observance of such good conduct all the evils and vices of man are destroyed and in the natural way there is the manifestation of so many virtues as forgiveness, kindness, peace, lustre, contentment, equanimity, knowledge, love and devotion, meekness, purity, coolness, tranquility of mind, subjugation of mind and senses etc., because this is the natural law that there is the growth of good behaviour by the virtues and virtues by the good conduct like the seed and tree and the flaws and evils are destroyed.*</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* Here, the virtues should be taken as seed and moral conduct as tree. </p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">So, this is proper for the boys that they should try their best for the growth of virtues and abservance of moral conduct. By doing so the comfort and peace can be attained in this world and the next world both.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Self-restraint (Sanyam)</p>
<p class="Text">There is a great need of the control of mind, intellect and sense organs because without their control they do lead the man to the downfall. The Lord has also said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">इन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Gita 2/60)</p>
<p class="Text">‘O Arjuna! due to which these sense organs of torbulent nature forcibly carry away even the mind of the wise man practising self-control.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनु विधीयते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Gita 2/67)</p>
<p class="Text">‘As in the water the wind carries away the boat similarly among the sense organs floating in the flow of sensuous objects that particular sense organ (single sense organ) with which the mind is ttached takes away the wisdom of the not self-contfrolled man.’</p>
<p class="Text">Manuji has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">इन्द्रियाणां तु सर्वेषां यद्येकं क्षरतीन्द्रियम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तेनास्य क्षरति प्रज्ञा दृतेः पादादिवोदकम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/99)</p>
<p class="Text">‘If any single sense organ of the sense organs is deviated, merely due to that sense organ the man looses his wise sense in such a way as the whole water of the pot goes away out through a single small hole if it occurs in the pot.’</p>
<p class="Text">The control of inner self is named ‘Shama’ (tranquility of mind) and the control of sense organs is called ‘Dama’ (subjugation) basically the creators of Smriti have approved it the part of religion. In the <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span> ‘Sham’ (peace of mind and ‘dama’ (subjugation) have been accepted as the natural duty of Brahmans and in Vedanta they have been approved as the part of the spiritual exercise. </p>
<p class="Text">Self-restrained mind and sense organs are friend and unrestrained mind and sense organs are like foe. These are the main causes in the deliverance and bondage also. Because when they are restrained they are emancipator otherwise in case of being unrestrained they become the cause of the painful bondage. As this is the nature of water to fall down likewise the sense organs are attracted to the sensual objects due to having attachment. On account of the contact of material objects there is the growth of depravity and vices and it causes man’s downfall. Manuji says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">इन्द्रियाणां प्रसङ्गेन दोषमृच्छत्यसंशयम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">संनियम्य तु तान्येव ततः सिद्धिं नियच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/93)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Being attached with the sense organs man, undoubtedly, owns vices and only by restraining them he gets accomplishment by self-restraint.’</p>
<p class="Text">It proves that only the contact of the sense organs with sensuous objects is the root cause of all the disasters. So, O boys! comprehending all these objects of the worldly enjoyments perishable, transient, the cause of all the miseries, you should try your best to abandon them.</p>
<p class="Text">There are so many brothers who say that by the continuous enjoyment of the sensuous objects the desires are fulfilled automatically,, but their thinking is not right at all. Because Manuji has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">न जातु कामः कामानामुपभोगेन शाम्यति। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मेव भूय एवाभिवर्धते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(2/94)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The passionate desire of numberless sensuous enjoyments is never pacified by the epicureanism of lust, but opposit to it increases more and more like the fire with ghee.’</p>
<p class="Text">There are number of persons who think comfort and peace in the enjoyment of sensuous objects; but here they are in illusion, just as a moth feels comfort and peace in the resplendent lamp etc., but actually that lamp is its destroyer. In the same way the man attached to the sensuous pleasure of the world feels momentary comfort and peace, but as a matter of fact their contact with the worldly and sexual pleasures is to destroy them, means leading them to downfall. So anyhow whether by wisdom, comprehension, fear or obstinacy or by any means possible man should make his utmost effort being bent upon to have the mind and sense organs under self-control by detaching them from the sensuous pleasures. Manuji has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">इन्द्रियाणां विचरतां विषयेष्वपहारिषु। </p>

<p class="Text">So, O boys! first the sense-organs like speech etc., and then the mind should be restrained.</p>
<p class="Text">The man who censures or abuses, should be treated with the peace giving truthful words, with the pleasant beneficial and sweet mild words in return, because if his reproach is true, there is no loss at all, on the other hand He covers your virtues and this is his benefaction. You should tolerate it also if anyone beats or batters you, steals your any belonging or wrests your object by force or he gives you ill-treatment by anyway. You should remain pleased considering it the result of your own evil deeds as  the dispensation of the Lord because none can assail anyone harm without any sin and without the Lord’s inspiration.</p>
<p class="Text">Tolerance develops patience, bravery, gravity and self-confidence. All the adversities should be endured with the sentiment of forgiveness and not by fear or timidity. For the self-defence or to oppose injustice, the proper protest also according to need, is not improper.  But special consideration should be kept in mind that it may not cause any harm to anyone.

<p class="Text">The scent, the scented oil, the garland of flowers, the antimony of the eyes, the dressing of hair, dance, song, music, the sight, talk and touch of women and cinema theatre etc., to see the movie, all these should be abandoned considering them erotic and semen destroying.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Celibacy</p>
<p class="Text">He who has abandoned the sexual union by all means* is famous as celibate.</p>
<p class="footnote-hindi-center">* स्मरणं कीर्तनं केलि: प्रेक्षणं गुह्यभाषणम्।</p>
<p class="footnote-hindi-center">संकल्पोऽध्यवसायश्च क्रियानिष्पत्तिरेव च॥</p>
<p class="xfootnote">To remember a woman, to talk about woman, to do the merrymaking with women, to see a woman, to talk to a woman secretly, to resolve to meet a woman, to make effort and to enjoy sex with a woman-these are eight kinds of sexual pleasures counted.</p>
<p class="Text">Because to protect the semen by all means or the observance of celibacy is the main factor in the attainment of the Supreme Being (Brahma). The observer of the vow as mentioned above whether he lives in the hermitage of the preceptor or he is with his mother-father in the house, is a celibate. O boys! To observe the vow of celibacy is also your most important duty. By observing celibacy the Supreme Being can be achieved by the development of vitality lustre, virtues and moral conduct.</p>
<p class="Text">So, you should remain very alert from the company of the women. It is a far fetched affair to see the sight of a women, to hear her words, to touch her and to think of her in the mind, a celibate should not see even her photo or picture or her image. If it is quite needed then you should talk to her casting down the eyes towards your feet or looking down towards the ground and treating her as your mother or sister. But in any secluded place even to meet the sister or the mother is prohibited. Because, the contact of women deviates the sense organs of the wise men also  by their ingtellect being corrupted. Manu has also said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मात्रा स्वस्रा दुहित्रा वा न विविक्तासनो भवेत्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">बलवानिन्द्रियग्रामो विद्वांसमपि कर्षति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/215)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Man should not sit with his mother, sister or daughter even in any lonely place; because all the sense organs are very powerful; so it attracts even the learned persons towards it.’</p>
<p class="Text">The name of Mahavir Hanuman is very famous in the observance of the celibacy vow. The readers of the<span class="char-style-override-1"> Ramayana</span> are well acquainted with his life-history also. Hanuman was a supernatural brave man. Hanuman crossed the ocean, killed Akshay Kumar, the son of Ravan, burnt Lanka to ashes; conveyed the message of Janakiji to Shri Rama and in the condition of Lakshman’s unconsciousness caused by ‘Shaktibana’ (the powerful arrow), on the advice of Sushen Vaidya, due to being unable to distinguish the herbal medicine as per his advice, he rooted out the entire mountain along with the herbal and presented it in Lanka before the sun-rise; On going through <span class="char-style-override-1">‘Kishkindhakanda</span> and <span class="char-style-override-1">Sunderakanda’</span> we come to know that Hanuman was not only a brave but he was of a moral conduct, learned, knower of prosperity and accomplishment and a great devotee of the Lord; in the praise of whose glory the Lord, Himself has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रति उपकार करौं का तोरा। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सनमुख होइ न सकत मन मोरा॥</p>
<p class="Text">‘Hanuman! I am indebted to the service given by you to Me. It is beyond My capacity to pay off your debt. I feel ashamed to show My face to you due to My incapability.’</p>
<p class="Text">Even today, the Indians worship him considering him steadfast in celibacy; the devotees sing in his praise, those who practise physical exercise want to increase their vitality by naming their groups as ‘Mahabirdala’. As a matter of fact, the virtuous characteristics of Hanuman which a man remembers, the small portion of that virtue inheres in him.</p>
<p class="Text">To say anything about the brave Prince Shri Lakshmanji is like to show the lamp to the Sun, he was the servant of the Lord ardently and the incarnation of ‘Sheshaji’. Having incarnated with Shri Ramaji he presented the example of an ideal conduct in the public welfare and for the public propriety. He was of moral conduct, the treasure of virtues, the exclusive devotee of the Lord and famous as a great warrior. He killed that brave Meghnada whom even the Lord Indra was unable to win. He did not fear even from the death itself at the opportune moment. This was all because of the influence of the celibacy-vow.</p>
<p class="Text">You would have heard the name of the Ganga’s son, Bhishmpitamah. He was a great lustrous, modest, he was the celibate all his life, devotee of God and great soul brave man. For the sake of his father’s service he sacrificed the woman and wealth forever in a moment and by its influence he won the death also. Once, to see his father Shantanu in  the pensive mood, Devavrat (Bhishmpitamah) asked him the reason of his sorrow. His father expressed his desire to marry for the increase of sons. To know the cause of his father’s sorrow the wise Devavrat asked his father’s old chief also the cause of his father’s grief going to him. Then, the chief related to him in detail about Dhivararaj’s daughter (fostered) and related the narrative of Dhivararaj’s desire also. Then, Devavrat accompanied by a number of Kshatriyas approached that Dhivararaj and asked for his daughter for his father. Dhivararaj welcomed him warmly according to the manners and stated thus—‘O Devavrata! You are the eldest son of your father and you deserve to be the king, but I am the father of the daughter, so I want to say something to you. The condition is that I want that the son born of this daughter should be enthroned as the king. On this condition I can marry my daughter with your father otherwise not.’ To hear these words of Dasaraj (Dhivararaj) the Ganga’s son, Devavrat gave this answer before those kings—‘O Dasaraj! I will do what you say. These are my true words; be sure of it. The son who is born of your daughter, will occupy the throne as a king.’ Then, Dhivararaj said—‘O the righteous and follower of truth  and morality! What you have promised for my daughter Satyavati before all the kings, is according  to your worth, you will follow your promise, I have no doubt at all, but I am suspicious of your sons who will be born to you—They can grab the kingship from my daughter’s son.’ Then, the Ganga’s son Devavrat made another promise to please his father. Devavrat said—‘O Dasaraj! Listen to my words what I promise before these kings for the sake of my father. (I have already sacrificed the kingship beforehand). Since today I will observe celibacy throughout my life. It means remaining unmarried the whole life, I will be the celibate all my life.’ To hear these words of the prince Devavrat, Dhivararaj said with pleasure—‘O Devavrata! I offer my daughter for your father.’ At that time the gods and the sages said—‘He is the doer of heroic deeds, so he is ‘Bhishma’. Saying thus, they began to shower the rain of flowers from the sky. (Since then, Ganga’s son Devavrat abecame famous by the name of ‘glorious Bhishm’.) Then after Bhishma said to Satyavati, the auspicious daughter of Dhiwararaj—‘Mother! Get up on this chariot, let us move for home.’ Having stated so he came to Hastinapur after seating that maiden in his chariot and offered that maiden to his father. To see his this arduous work all the kings began to praise him and began to say—‘He has done a great heroic work, so we, all the kings name him as ‘Bhishma’. When the king Shantanu heard that Devavrata had done such an ardous work, being very much pleased he granted Mahatma Bhishma the boon of ‘self-willed death’ by the influence of his penance. He said—‘O sinless! So long as you want to remain alive the death will not be effective on you; the death can kill you only when you wish so.’</p>
<p class="Text">By the influence of his lifelong celibacy, in Kashi having defeated all the kings Bhishma brought the three daughters—Amba, Ambika, Ambalika of Kashiraj forcefully from the ‘Swayamber’ (the suitror’s assembly) to marry them with his brother Vichitravirya. He released Amba among them having desire to marry with Shalvaraj and kept his promise by fighting against sage Jamdagni’s son Parashurama in favour of Amba a fierce war for a long time.</p>
<p class="Text">By going through the <span class="char-style-override-1">Mahabharata</span> it comes to our knowledge that Bhishma was not only an outstanding brave,  but he was of an outstanding moral conduct, endowed with  knower of the Shastras, the next form of Sun and the crest jewel among the devotees. On the persuation of Lord Shri Krishna, Bhishma had given the supernatural sermons of devotion, knowledge, moral conduct etc., about the piety to the king Yudhishthir with which the Shantiparv and Anushasan Parv are full of. By the influence of life long celibacy, he attained the Supreme state of salvation having achieved the glory and death according to his will.</p>
<p class="Text">Describing the glory of celibacy Lord Shri Krishna has said in the ‘<span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span>’—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यदिच्छन्तो ब्रह्मचर्यं चरन्ति </p>

<p class="Text para-style-override-3">So, the boys should pay special attention to the vow of celibacy. If it may not be possible to remain as a celibate all the life, then, according to the Shastras one should observe the vow of celibacy till the age of twenty four, if even this may not be possible, at least according to the modern time one must observe the vow of celibacy till the age of eighteen and the boy who breaks the vow of celibacy even before this age becomes the victim of untimely death being the victim of repentence and diseases forever. By the excessive indulgence in sensual enjoyments  vitality, semen, lustre, intelligence, knowledge, memory having been destroyed and faults, vices and immorality having increased, he leads to downfall. So this is my humble submission to the householder brothers also that they should make the sex indulgence with his wife not more than once in a month after the monthly course. Because the householder observing the above rules of sex indulgence is considered also like a celibate or an ascetic. <span></span></p>

<p class="Text para-style-override-3">So, O boys! You should also make the whole hearted effort being bent upon for the practice of knowledge having abandoned the taste floppishness, enjoyment, comfort, laziness and heedlessness considering them obstacles in the practice of knowledge.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">The service of mother, father, preceptor and the teachers</p>
<p class="Text">There is no other piety like the service of mother, father, preceptor and teachers and to obey them for the boys. Manu has also said—their service is the Supreme religion and the rest are secondary—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">त्रिष्वेतेष्विति कृत्यं हि पुरुषस्य समाप्यते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">एष धर्मः परः साक्षादुपधर्मोऽन्य उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> <span class="char-style-override-3">(2/237)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘Only by the service of these three man’s all the other duties are fulfilled. This is the apparent supreme religion, instead of it all the others are secondary.’</p>
<p class="Text">The fact is that in the Shastras mother father and preceptors have been approved as all the three worlds, the three Vedas and gods. The Shruti says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मातृदेवो भव। पितृदेवो भव। आचार्यदेवो भव।</p>
<p class="Text">‘Respect the mother, father and preceptor as the gods.’ Manu has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">त एव हि त्रयो लोकास्त एव त्रय आश्रमाः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">त एव हि त्रयो वेदास्त एवोक्तास्त्रयोऽग्नयः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> <span class="char-style-override-3">(2/230)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘All these three have been accepted as the three worlds, three stages of life, the three Vedas and the three fires.’</p>
<p class="Text">Explaining the austerity the Lord has said that first of all the service and worship of the elders is the penance of body—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">देवद्विजगुरुप्राज्ञपूजनं शौचमार्जवम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">ब्रह्मचर्यमहिंसा च शारीरं तप उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Gita <span class="char-style-override-3">17/14)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘The worship of God, Brahman, preceptor and the savants, purity, simplicity, celibacy and non-violence are called the penance of body.’</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">So, it is proper for the students that being free from laziness and obstinate error and considering the service of mother, father and the preceptors as their highest moral duty, they should serve, worship and obey them promptly.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8">The service of the preceptors</p>
<p class="Text">The service of the preceptor only can be sufficient for a man to attain the Supreme being. It has been said in the <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita </span>also—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">अन्ये त्वेवमजानन्तः श्रुत्वान्येभ्य उपासते। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">तेऽपि चातितरन्त्येव मृत्युं श्रुतिपरायणाः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (13/25)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The others means the dull-minded persons, they (themselves) not knowing thus, worship to hear from other men who know the essentials of the absolute truth and those persons devoted to what they have heard also undoubtedly cross the ocean of birth and death.’</p>
<p class="Text">There are so many such examples found in the Vedas and Shastras. Once, Ayoddhaumya Muni said to his disciple named Aruni, resident of Punjab—‘O Aruni! Going to the field make the barricade’. On the command of the preceptor Aruni went there but he could not check the flow of water even after his all efforts. At last an idea came to his mind and he himself laid down in the square plot. The flow of water was checked by his lying down. When Aruni did not return in time, Ayoddhaumya Muni asked the other disciples—‘Where is Aruni the resident of Punjab?’ The disciples answered—‘It is you to send him to the field to check the water.’ To hear the words of his disciples the Muni said—‘Let us all also go there where Aruni is.’ Then, reaching the field, the preceptor began to address him to call—‘Son Aruni! Where are you? Come on.’ To hear his preceptor’s voice abruptly rose and presented himself before the preceptor and said—‘O Lord! The water of your plot was flowing out, I could not check it despite my all efforts. Then, at last I, myself laid down there, that is how the flow of the water was checked. At present I have come to you on your call and salute you; command me what is the work for me to do?’ The preceptor said—‘Son! You have come out after checking the flow of water, so you will be famous by the name of ‘Uddalaka’. After saying this showering his grace on him the preceptor said—‘You have obeyed me with your body and mind so the entire Vedas and theology will enlighten your mind without study and you will get redeemed.’ Then getting the blessings of the preceptor, Aruni (Uddalaka) went away to his country-land by the permission of the preceptor. (<span class="char-style-override-1">Mahabharata Adiparva</span>, Chapter 3)</p>
<p class="Text">There was a woman named Jabala. Her son’s name was Satyakama. Once, going to Haridrumat Gautam he said—‘I have come here to reside with you observing the vow of celibacy.’ The preceptor said—‘O Saumya! What is your clan?’ Then, Satyakama said—‘Lord! I don’t know.’ Then Gautama said—‘No other one except a Brahmana can speak the truth so categorically.’ So, you are a Brahmana; because you have not abandoned the truth.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Then, getting his sacred thread ceremony performed he selected out four hundred weak and feeble cows and said to him—‘O Saumya! Go after these cows.’ To know the motive of the preceptor Satyakama said—‘I will not come back until the number of these cows increases to one thousand.’ Then, he went to a forest, very rich in greenery where there was plenty of water and grass and remained serving the cows for a long time. When the number of cows increased to one thousand, a bull said to him—‘O Satyakam! Now our number has increased to one thousand. Now, make us reach the hermitage of the sage.’ Then, Satyakama brought these cows to the hermitage and by the influence of the preceptor’s obedience he attained the form of the solidified consciousness and bliss Brahma through the bull, fire, swan and Mudgal. This fable is there in the Canto 4 to 9 of the Chapter 4 in ‘<span class="char-style-override-1">Chhandogyopanishada</span>’ even. </p>
<p class="Text">Once, Kamal’s son Upkoshala served Satyakama after taking sacred thread from son of Jabala. Then, Satyakama’s wife said to her husband—‘This Upkoshala has already practised a very hard penance, he has served the fires very well. So, he should be given the knowledge of Brahma.’ Satyakama did not give any answer at that time and went away out without giving any sermon. After his departure the fires gave the sermon of Brahma to Upkoshala remaining on fast. Then after the preceptor returned and asked him—‘O Saumya! Your face appears to be like the face of God-realized one, who has given you sermons?’ Then, Upkoshala indicated towards the fires. Then, the preceptor asked—‘What sermons have they given?’ Then, he related the whole story as it was. Then, the preceptor said—‘O Saumya! now I will give you the sermon of Brahma which will relieve you from the commitance of any sin just like the lotus-leaf from the water.’ Then, Upkoshala said—‘Then, give me your sermon.’ Then, the preceptor gave him the sermon of Brahma and he attained the Supreme Being. This fable is there in the canto from ten to fifteen in the Chapter four of ‘<span class="char-style-override-1">Chhandyogopanishada</span>.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Nowadays the boys have forgotten with whom and what behaviour should be done. What to talk of others—it has become a far fetched affair for the students how to behave with their teachers, preceptors, Guru and the teachers imparting them education, there are some students who see them with hatred and basefulness and there are a few who disdainfully ridicule them also. This is all the result of the lack of the education according to the rules of Shastras. Going to the preceptors how they should serve them, worship them welcome them and thus, how they should behave with them, it can be known only to see the teachings of the sages like Manu etc. A man is charmed to remember how glorious and high ideal was the past  behaviour of the students with their preceptors and how  was our civilization. Manuji says—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">शरीरं चैव वाचं च बुद्धीन्द्रियमनांसि च। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">नियम्य प्राञ्जलिस्तिष्ठेद्वीक्षमाणो गुरोर्मुखम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> <span class="char-style-override-3">(2/192)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘The students should remain stood restraining their body, speech, wisdom, sense organs and mind all with folded hands looking towards the face of the preceptors.’</p>

<p class="SHLOK">उत्तिष्ठेत्प्रथमं चास्य परमं चैव संविशेत्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Manu. <span class="char-style-override-3">2/194)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘The student should always take simple meal, wear simple clothes and remain in a simple dress before the preceptor and he should get up in the morning earlier than the preceptor.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">आसीनस्य स्थितः कुर्यादभिगच्छंस्तु तिष्ठतः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">प्रत्युद‍्गम्य त्वाव्रजतः पश्चाद्धावंस्तु धावतः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Manu. <span class="char-style-override-3">2/196)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘The student should talk to the preceptor in the standing position if he is sitting, going infront of him if he is standing, going a few steps ahead if he is coming towards him and running after him if he is going onward.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">नीचं शय्यासनं चास्य सर्वदा गुरुसन्निधौ। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">गुरोस्तु चक्षुर्विषये न यथेष्टासनो भवेत्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Manu. <span class="char-style-override-3">2/198)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘Near the preceptor’s bedstead and mat-seat the disciple’s bedstead and mat-seat should be always lower than his bed-stead and sitting mat. Before the eyes of the preceptor the disciple should not sit in a careless manner.’ He faces the miserable condition by the untruthful conduct with the preceptor. Manuji has said— </p>
<p class="SHLOK">परीवादात्खरो भवति श्वा वै भवति निन्दकः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">परिभोक्ता कृमिर्भवति कीटो भवति मत्सरी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> <span class="char-style-override-3">(2/201)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘He who attributes the false faults to the preceptor  becomes donkey, who censures him becomes dog, who misuses his wealth becomes worm and who is jealous to him becomes insect.’ </p>
<p class="Text">So, ill behaviour should never be done with the preceptor.</p>
<p class="Text">O boys! When you go to the preceptors to learn knowledge, have your mind, speech and sense-organs under your control; with simplicity, love and devotion keeping yourself lower than him and saluting him with meekness and simplicity you should make the study of knowledge and ask him the questions and answers.</p>
<p class="Text">By showing such a behaviour the preceptor can give the  sermon, impart knowledge and education with pleasure. The servant serving him can acquire knowledge from him very easily. The Lord has also said in the <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span>—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">उपदेश्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (4/34)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Understand the true nature of that knowledge by approaching the illumined soul, if you prostrate at their feet, render them service, and question them with an open and guileless heart, those wise seers of Truth will instruct you in that knowledge.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Now it is being explained how to salute the preceptor going to him. Manu has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">व्यत्यस्तपाणिना कार्यमुपसंग्रहणं गुरोः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सव्येन सव्यः स्पष्टव्यो दक्षिणेन च दक्षिणः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/72)</p>
<p class="Text">‘By exchanging the hands crossing each other the preceptor’s feet should be saluted. The preceptor’s left foot should be touched with left hand and the right foot should be touched with the right hand.’</p>
<p class="Text">The same method should be applied while touching the feet of mother-father or other reverent persons. Because the elder sister, the elder brother’s wife, the mother’s sister, the maternal uncle’s wife, the mother-in-law, the father’s sister etc., are also like the preceptor’s wife or mother and their husbands are like the preceptor and father. So, this is the moral duty of a man to welcome them; serve them and salute them.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">Anyone elder or older to us should be offered salutation with due respect and needs to be served. Even among them the learned Brahmans knowing Vedas and Shastras are the worthiest of warm welcome.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">The service of mother-father</p>
<p class="Text">None can question regarding the service of mother-father as they are the worthiest of all deserving for the service and respect. Manuji has also said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">उपाध्यायान्दशाचार्य आचार्याणां शतं पिता। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">सहस्रं तु पितॄन्माता गौरवेणातिरिच्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/145)</p>
<p class="Text">‘In the greatness one preceptor has the superior position to the ten teacher, the father is higher than one hundred preceptors and the mother is higher than one thousand fathers.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, this is proper for the ambitious one of the self emancipation to serve them earnestly with love and devotion. Just mark, Maharaj Yudhishthir was of a high moral conduct, the treasure of virtues, a great God-devotee, without adversary and a great holy person. Who is capable to explain and write his virtues and character-sketch? Despite all these merits he was an uncommon great devotee of his mother-father. It doesn’t end here, he was not in any way less in the devotion of his elder father Dhritrashtra and Gandhari. He considered it his moral duty to obey even their improper command. The king Dhritrashtra got the lac house built with the purpose of burning the Pandavas to ashes and commanded the Pandavas including their mother to reside there with ill motive. By accepting even this deceitful command and also understanding the foul play of Dhritrashtra’s underhand conspiracy, Yudhishthir resided in the lac house in Varnavat; but due to taking the reliance of the righteousness despite obeying his such a deceitful command the righteousness protected him. The embodiment of Dharma, Viduraji saved the Pandavas including their mother by taking out them from the lac house through the underpass having got it constructed because the man who follows morality, the righteousness is bound to protect him. It is there in the Shastras that the ‘Dharma’ (the righteousness) deserts none—it is the people who abandon Dharma. So, it is proper for the man not to give up the moral path in the great adverse hardships also by coming under the control of sexual lust, greed, fear and attachment. </p>
<p class="Text">The king Yudhishthir had to pass through many severe sufferings but he always followed the moral rules of righteousness, so the morality also remained protecting him.</p>
<p class="Text">Gambling is a great sin and the cause of all disasters but despite this understanding the king Yudhishthir gambled to obey the command of Dhritrashtra. As a result he endured the great insult of Draupadi and the horrible sufferings of banishment; but on account of not deviating from the moral path of obedience at last, victory favoured him by the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p class="Text">Later on, even after gaining the immense of royal prosperity the king Yudhishthir always served and saluted Dhritrashtra and Gandhari who did always injustice to him. When Dhritrashtra intended to go to the woods he expressed his desire for the riches beyond limit to donate the Brahmans in charity with the purpose of spiritual gain to his sons and relatives. At that time the king Yudhishthir conveyed this message through Vidur in the clear words—‘Whatever the property and prosperity belongs to me the entire is yours. Even my body is under your control, you can use the entire as you will.’ (<span class="char-style-override-1">Mahabharata, Ashramvasikaparva,</span> chapter 12) O the readers! just think and pay heed. To give such a moral and generous treatment to such an opponent trying always to end the life is not a common thing. That is why the king Yudhishthir is famous even today by the name of ‘Dharmaraj’ and it was only the influence of his observance of morality and religion that going to the heaven in his physical body form he got the unparallel Supreme state later on. So, without any consideration of the proper-improper, right-wrong behaviour of mother-father and preceptor with us we should serve our father, mother and preceptor with love and devotion and simplicity. </p>
<p class="Text">Then, the mother-father who have born us, are the worthiest one of our respect and service; because our body is thrilled to remember their affliction what they have suffered in our bringing up. Manu has said—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">यं मातापितरौ क्लेशं सहेते सम्भवे नृणाम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">न तस्य निष्कृतिः शक्या कर्तुं वर्षशतैरपि॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (2/227)</p>
<p class="Text">‘The return of the affliction what the mother-father pass through at the time of the son’s birth cannot be paid off even by rendering them service etc., for one hundred years.’</p>
<p class="Text">So, without the motive of paying off their debt we should serve them, worship them and obey them considering it our great moral duty. To observe so is the greatest religion and penance; it means that there is neither any religion nor any penance like the service of mother-father. So, Dharmabyadh became the knower of all the three periods in spite of being a hunter only by the influence of the service of his mother-father. He served his mother and father with love, devotion, meekness and reverence.</p>
<p class="Text">He kept his mother-father in a very good house like a holy temple of God—there used to be many bedsteads and seats for rest. As a man worships the gods, similarly he kept them pleased regarding his mother-father as ‘Yagya’ Havan fire, Veda and the greatest god with flowers, fruits, wealth. He himself washed their feet, bathed them, fed them and talked to them in the sweet and pleasant words and behaved as was favourable to them. Thus, being free from laziness and being set in the discipline of of the subjugation of the mind and sense organs considering his great moral duty, he including his wife and son served them earnestly with their mind, body and speech, due to the influence of which having got the everlasting glory and divine sight in this world they got the salvation.</p>
<p class="Text">Kaushik Muni also who had renounced for the penance without seeking the permission of mother-father got salvation by serving his mother-father considering their service higher than penance after the conversation with this Dharmavyadh.</p>
<p class="Text">He  who does not serve his mother-father and disobeys them and thus, behaves against the moral conduct becomes the victim of censure and evil destiny. This is well-known in the world that the king Kansa divesting the kingship forcibly, had imprisoned his father. Due to this immoral action the black stigma of infamy is still even today as a blot in his character; Even today if any boy misbehaves with his mother-father they blame him as the incarnation of Kansa in the form of abusive language but that son who serves his parents, salutes them and acts upon their will as an obedient son praise him for his merits and virtues with the speech overjoyed with emotion being charmed with his conduct-comparing him to Shravan Kumar. So, this is my humble submission to the students that they should be called Shravan Kumar instead of Kansa by their ideal character.</p>
<p class="Text">It must be known to you that Shravan Kumar was the son of a Vaishya ascetic sage. The detail narrative of Shravan Kumar has been described in the 63 and 64 canto of <span class="char-style-override-1">Ayodhyakanda</span> in <span class="char-style-override-1">Valmikiya Ramayana</span>.</p>
<p class="Text">When <span class="char-style-override-1">Maryadapurushottama</span> Lord Shri Ramachandraji, had gone away to the woods cheerfully in the obedience of his father’s command, the king Dasharatha began to weep in lamentation going to the palace of kausalya in the distress of the obedient Lord Shri Ramachandraji’s separation remembering the modest and service and conducts etc., of Rama. After the departure of the Lord Shri Ramachandraji for the woods being afflicted by the son’s separation the king said to Kausalya in midnight of the sixth night of the departure—‘O goddess! When we were not married and I had got the position of Prince at that time due to my bad habit one day, having mounted on the chariot with bow and arrow I went to the bank of Sarayu river for hunting where the male buffalo and elephants etc., the beasts of the forest used to come to quench their thirst. Then, in the dark night of the heavy rain someone began to sink his pitcher into the river water, the sound of the filling water into the pitcher seemed to me as if any elephant was drinking water. With this presumption aiming at the sound I shot an arrow. In the meanwhile the words of any forest dweller was heard to me—‘Oh! Oh! Who shot this arrow at me? I am an ascetic, I had come here on the bank of the river to fetch water in such a dead of night, who killed with arrow this forest dweller like me. Pulling on the life depending on the fruits-roots of the forest, wearing the deer-skin and matted hair? By killing me what will his purpose be served? I never did ill to anyone, then, who used this arm at me without any reason? I have no anguish of my own life; the anguish is of my old mother-father only. Till now, I have been looking after them; but after my death how will my old parents pull on their life, so all of us were killed.’</p>
<p class="Text">O Kausalya! I felt a great shock to hear this pathetic speech and the bow and arrow fell down from my hand. Being ignorant of proper and improper duty and being distressed with agony, I went there. Going there I saw that a young ascetic distressed with agony and besmeared with blood and afflicted with arrow was writhing lying on the ground holding the pitcher in his hand. To see me he said—‘O king! What harm have I assailed you? I am the forest-dweller;  I had come here to take water for my parents to quench their thirst; the both are weak, blind and thirsty, they must be feeling very much distressed waiting for me. My father does not know even my this condition; so, O Raghava! Before my father burns you to ashes make haste to go there and relate this occurence to him, O the king! This is the small track to reach my father’s hermitage. Reaching there hastely please my father so that he may not curse you in wrath and taking out this sharp arrow from the vital part of my body relieve me from pain.</p>
<p class="Text">O Kausalya! Then, that sage realizing the emotion of my mind in spite of being on the verge of death and having no energy to speak, gathering courage said to see my worried condition—‘O king! You don’t take out the arrow with the fear of Brahman’s murder—be free from this fear, I am the son of a Vaishya.’ When the young sage said so, I took the arrow out of his chest. He felt a severe pain while taking out the arrow and at the very moment he gave up the life. To see him dead I felt a great agony. O Goddess! Then, I began to worry for how to get benediction. Then, after well-consideration I filled the pitcher with the water of the river and moved towards the hermitage of his father on the track as guided by the ascetic and reaching there I saw his old mother-father. Their condition was very miserable and their body was extremely weak. They were waiting for their son to bring the water. I was already feeling as if unconscious with the anguished mind due to fear and when I reached the hermitage my anguish was multiplied to see their condition. To hear The approaching sound of the footstep the sage said thinking him his own son—‘O son! Why did you make so delay? Well, now give the water without any delay. I am blind of eyes so it is you only who is my motion, eyes and life; then why don’t you speak today?  Then with the fearful mind very carefully in mild tone introducing myself to him I related the whole occurence of Shravana’s death from the beginning to the end as it was. </p>
<p class="Text">To hear the entire occurence of my horrible sin, feeling distressed in lamentation, his eyes being full of tears, the ascetic said with folded hands to me standing—‘O the king! You committed this crime, if you had not narrated it with your own mouth, your head would have broken into hundreds and thousands of pieces and the whole Raghu’s clan would have been ruined today. O the king! Whatever happened that has become the matter of the past. Now take us to our son. We want to see the face of our son once; because we will not get his sight again in this life.’</p>
<p class="Text">Then I took the both old wife and husband afflicted with the death of their son there. Reaching close to their son the both fell down to touch the dead body of their son and wailing in lamentation said—‘O son! When the midnight passed you used to rise from the bed and related the lessons of religious scriptures etc., to us to hear which we felt very much pleased. Now who will please us to relate the subject matters of those scriptures? O son! now, who will delight us by the morning bath, ‘Sandhyopasana’ (morning evening prayer) and offering the oblations to the fire? ‘O son! On account of blindness we are incapable even to pull on our life by collecting rootlet and fruits from the forest. It is you who used to manage our bath, meditation and food etc. Now, you passed away leaving us helpless. Now, who will feed us like the dear guest to bring the rootlet and fruits from the forest? Now we will be unable to stay longer here in this wood in the condition of orphan, helpless and restless with agony by anyway, we will depart for the world of the Lord Yama (the god of death) very soon. O son! You are free from sin; but certainly you would have committed any sin in your previous birth as a result of which you were killed. So, you, too, attain the same position in that world by the power of my truthfulness where the braves killed with arms reach and you should also attain the same higher position of salvation what Sagar, Shaibya, Dilip etc., the foremost sages had achieved. You should also get the same position in the next world what the virtuous persons get after abandoning this worldly body.’</p>
<p class="Text">Thus, that sage wailing again and again in the pathetic tone offered water in libation to his son along with his wife. Then, that pious young sage having assumed the divine  form by the influence of his dutifulness mounting on the aerial car began to depart for the supreme divine world very soon. At that moment consoling his mother-father he said—‘O father! As the fruit of the virtuous deed of your service that I had done, I have got the highest abode in the heaven and both of you will also come to me very soon.’ Having uttered this the self-restraint young sage went away to desired Divine world.</p>
<p class="Text">Then after the great ascetic blind sages said to me standing with folded hands—‘O the king! You are Kshatriya by caste and you have killed a sage unknowingly, so, you will not be the sinner of Brahmans murder but similarly like us you will also suffer the miserable condition; I mean to say that you will also die by the shock of your son’s separation.’ Thus, the two blind ascetics having cursed me wailing in lamentation and having made their pyre burnt themselves to ashes went away to the heaven with the dead one.</p>
<p class="Text">O goddess! By shooting the target on hearing the sound, the sin I had committed unknowingly due to which, I have come to this, miserable condition. Now, the time has come—thus, having narrated the history the king began to weep and being afraid with the horror of death he said to Kausalya again—‘O blessed! The treatment what I have given to Ramachandra is not at all worth doing; but he is worthy of the treatment what he has given in response. Is there any such son in the world who does not speak even a single word in protest even after the banishment by the father? So, neither there is such a cruel father like me and nor there is such a great modest son like Ramachandra in the world. O goddess! What can be a greater distress for me than not to see such a valorous and truthful Ramachandra even at the time of death? Really they are the happiest and blessed persons who will see the lotus face like the full moon of the automn season and bloomed lotus flower of Shri Ramachandraji on his return to Ayodhya in the fifteenth year from today. O Kausalya! I became orphan completely to send Ramchandra to the woods. Thus distressed and restless in lamentation Dasharathaji began to wail in lamentation—‘O Rama! O Almighty-armed! O devoted to father! O the destroyer of anguish! You are my Lord and you are my son. Where did you go away? O Kausalya! O Sumitra! You are invisible to me.’ Thus, being extremely impatient and restless with anguish the king Dasharatha passed away lamenting in the mid-night.</p>
<p class="Text">So, O boys! You like Shrawan Kumar, the Vaishya sage and Maryadapurushottama, Shri Ramachandraji  should salute the feet of mother-father and obey their command with love, devotion, modesty and simplicity and serve them earnestly being devoted to them. Those persons who remain devoted in the service of their mother father are enriched with not only long life, knowledge and valour but they become the worthy of Supreme state in this world and in the next world and their glory does not fade for the long time.</p>
<p class="Text">Today in the world Shrawan’s repute is renowned. What to talk of Shri Ramachandraji, He was the manifested form of the Supreme Lord. He had incarnated in this world only for the public propriety of conduct. Maryada-Purushottama Lord’s behaviour is an ideal for public welfare. Shri Ramachandraji’s behaviour with His mother-father and preceptor  was already full of love-devotion and simplicity; but for Sita and His brothers and for the whole public also he had the supernatural kindness and love. So, considering Shri Ramachandraji Maharaj as your ideal you should make your whole-hearted effort and become bent upon to shape your own disposition, conduct and character according to His obedience, nature and conduct making it the goal of your life. Thus, the observance of morality with unselfish motiveleads to the highest good of the attainment of the Supreme Being, by observing such righteousness even if anyone dies there is redemption in that death also.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Devotion</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord’s Devotion is useul for all; but for the boys  it is more more useful. The heart of the child is tender   whatever he tries or tries to act his sacraments go on rooted in their heart accordingly. So long as he remain unmarried he is treated as celibate. </p>
<p class="Text">‘Brahma’ is the name of Supreme Being; whoever remains moving about in Him is celibate. It means to hear, to contemplate, to share the congregational singing of the Lord’s Name, form, attributes and characters is to move about in ‘Brahma’. This is called Lord’s Devotion and seeking shelter to the Lord also. So, O the children! By reading it in the virtuous books or by hearing from the saints the Lord’s Name, form, attributes, character, love, influence, essentials and the mysterious matters installing them lovingly in your heart you should observe them accordingly.</p>
<p class="Text">By doing so to know the Lord’s attributes, influence, essential truth and the mystery man can achieve God very easily. The Lord has said in the <span class="char-style-override-1">Gita</span>—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">मच्चित्ता मद्‍गतप्राणा बोधयन्तः परस्परम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">कथयन्तश्च मां नित्यं तुष्यन्ति च रमन्ति च</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (10/9)</p>
<p class="Text">‘With their mind fixed on Me, and their lives surrendered to Me, conversing and enlightening one another about My glories, and speaking of Me, My devotees ever remain contented and take delight in Me.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">ददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते॥</p>

<p class="Text">‘On those ever united through meditation with Me and worshipping Me with love, I confer that Yoga of wisdom by which they come to Me.’</p>
<p class="Text">The name of ‘Dhruva’ is renownedin the world already. When he was five years old once Dhruvaji began to sit in the lap of his father. Then, the arrogant queen, Suruchi said the jealous words to her step son, Dhruva before the king—‘O Dhruva! You are not entitled to sit in the lap of the king or on the royal throne because you are not born of my womb. If you have desire to sit on the seat of the king, then, by the practice of penance worship the Lord and by the grace of the God only you will be born of my womb.’</p>
<p class="Text">The bitter words uttered by the step mother pierced into the heart of the child Dhruva like the arrow. Then, with tears in his eyes Dhruva went to his mother Suniti. Suniti saw Dhruva’s eyes full of tears Dhruva was taking long breath while weeping. Then, Suniti lifted him up into her lap. In the meanwhile the servants related the whole occurence as it was to Suniti going to her. Then, Suniti felt a great anguish in her heart to hear the words of her co-wife. She began to shed the rain of tears to hear her words. Suniti’s ocean of sorrow had no bound. She said to Dhruva—‘It is not right to blame others in this matter; because this is the result of the actions done in the previous birth. You are born of the womb of an unfortunate like me. Son! I am unfortunate, because the king feels shame to accept me as his maid servant even. Your step mother Suruchi has rightly said. If you are desirous to get the royal throne like the son of Suruchi, then, be the devotee of the lotus feet of Shri Hari, Son! I, too, say the same. Being free from jealousy seek the shelter to the feet of Shri Hari, affectionate to His devotees with pure consciousness. There is none in this world to free you from the sorrow except the Lord. To hear these words of his mother having patience in his mind and using his own wit Dhruva went away towards the forest from his father’s residence to fulfil the advice of his mother. </p>
<p class="Text">Narada Muni came to know all about this happening by his Yogic power, then coming to his way he met Dhruva on the way and putting his hands on his head he said—‘O child! What is to honour or dishonour you? If you have the consideration of your honour or ignominy then except your action none should be blamed. Man gets pleasure or pain, honour or dishonour according to his action. In getting the joys and comforts there is the decay of the meritorious deeds of the previous birth and in getting sorrow there is the decay of the sins of the previous birth. To know this fact, console your mind and consciousness. To feel pleasure to see other one more meritorious and virtuous than self, to show kindness to see the other one downtrodden and to befriend the equal one should be the principle of life. By this practice man does not suffer from pain and affliction. It is very difficult for the person unrestrainted of sense organs to please that Supreme Lord whom you want to please with your Yogic practice, so give up this idea.’ Then, Dhruva said—‘O lord! The ignorant person like me cannot follow that path of peace what you have shown to me favouring me with your grace. I am under the control of Kshatriya nature. So, I lack in gentleness and peace. O Brahmana! I want to acquire that position which could not be achieved by my ancestors. Tell me the easy way to reach the Supreme position of the three worlds.’</p>
<p class="Text">The Lord Narada was pleased to hear such words of Dhruva and to see his firm determination said—‘O son! Repeat the Name of Shri Hari in the same way as your mother has given you the sermon and making your mind pure, concentrate it to Shri Hari; because the service of Shri Hari is the only way to attain righteousness (Dharma) wealth (Arth) enjoyment (Kam) and salvation (Moksh) all these four objects.’ O son! May God bless you. Go to Madhuvan (Mathura) situated on the bank of Yamuna, where Shri Hari resides always. There having taken bath in the holy water of Yamuna and sitting on the mat seat you should meditate Hari with stable mind. The Lord is the most charming among all the gods; His face and eyes are cheerful, His nose, brows, cheeks are extremely beautiful and pleasant. He is in the age of blooming youth, His body-limbs are very charming, His lips and eyes are of red colour. On His chest there is the mark of Bhrigu’s feet. The colour of His body is swarthy like dark clouds and handsome. In His neck there is the garland of flowers, He is holding conch, discus, mace and lotus in his all the four hands. He is embellished with crown, earring and bracelet etc., the invaluable ornaments. He is downing the silken yellow piece of cloth (Pitambar) and there is ‘Kaustubh gem’ in His neck. There is the girdle of gold in His waist and in His feet there are golden anklets and in look he appears the idol of peace by seeing whom the eyes and mind feel blessed. There is a mild smile on his face and He is casting this look with loving sight. By appearance it seems as if He is ready to grant boon. He is the protector of seeking shelter to Him and the ocean of mercy. Thus, by meditating such an auspicious form of the Lord the mind gets the divine pleasure and then the mind cannot deviate from there for anywhere else having left that supreme joy; and the mind becomes completely absorbed in the Lord and O Prince! Just I tell you about a great secret spell, which you should always repeat. That is—<span class="char-style-override-1">‘Aum Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya’</span>, this spell consists of twelve letters. After pronouncing this spell the Lord should be worshipped with holy water, garland, the garland of flower, fruits-roots, grass and basil leaf.</p>
<p class="Text">To contemplate Shri Hari with the controlled mind, to live the life with peaceful nature, to take a light food of the fruits and rootlets of the forest, remain meditating the Lord’s character in the heart and detaching the sense organs from the sense objects by the Yogic practice of devotion with exclusive mind the Lord Vasudeva.</p>
<p class="Text">To hear this sermon of the foremost sage Naradaji the prince, Dhruva saluted Naradaji after taking his round and then taking leave from him he went away to Madhuvan (Mathura).</p>
<p class="Text">Reaching Madhuvan, Dhruva took bath and kept fast that night. Then, he began to propitiate the Lord with the concentration of mind according to the sermon of the foremost sage.</p>
<p class="Text">He passed his time first taking only the fruit of jujube in food, sometimes after he ate only the dry leaves, then, he came to the water only and then after he began to only depend on the air only. Then, in the fifth month the prince Dhruva began to remain absorbed in the meditation of the Lord present in his consciousness remaining stood on a single leg with holding his breath. Having detached his concentration from all sides he anchored his concentration to the Lord only existing in his innerself. At that time nothing except the Lord was visible to Dhruva.</p>
<p class="Text">After then the Lord visited Mathura to see the devotee Dhruva. Dhruva’s mind and wisdom was stable by the Yogic practice of meditation. He was meditating the form of the Lord influencive like electricity. Just then, the image of the Lord disappeared from his heart abruptly. When being restless Dhruva opened his eyes he saw the same manifested form of the Lord before his eye-sight. Being overjoyed in emotion wonder-struck Dhruva saluted  the Lord’s feet prostrating his whole body on the ground. Then Dhruva began to stare the Lord Hari with great love as if he would drink with eyes, kiss with his mouth, clasp Him in his arms. Dhruva with folded hands in the standing position wanted to recite hymns in the Lord’s praise, but he was not educated so he failed to pray verse. The omniscient Lord came to know this and He touched His conch with the cheeks of Dhruva. The very moment Dhruva came to know the Absolute truth and attained the fearless position and Dhruva got the entire knowledge of the Vedas and Shastras without study by the Lord’s grace, then, he began to recite hymns in the praise of the all pervading Lord Hari, the ocean of mercy slowly and slowly with devotion.</p>
<p class="Text">Then, Lord, the affectionatge to the devotees, being pleased said—‘O Prince! May be blessed! By My grace you will get the <span class="char-style-override-1">‘Dhruvapada’</span> (the stable position) in the next world which is extremely illuminated even after the annihilation of residing living tothe end of Kalpa that does  annihilation. All the living beings salute that world. Reaching there the ascetics don’t come back to this mortal world again and here, also, your father will go to the woods after handing over the kingship to you. You will rule on this earth for thirty six thousand years but your innerself will never be indulged in the worldly enjoyments.’ Thus, having granted the boons to Dhruva the Lord went away to His Supreme world in the twinkling of eye.</p>
<p class="Text">Prahlad was already the crest jewel of devotee, what to talk of him? O boys! When Prahlad was in his mother’s womb, Naradaji had given him sermon of Devotion at that time. It was its influence that he became the crest jewel of devotee in this world. Prahlad’s father devised several means to kill him by drowning him in the water, by throwing him from the peak of the mountain, by giving him poison, by getting him bitten by the snakes, by getting him trampled by elephant, by getting him severed with the arms, by burning him in the fire etc., but he received not even a scratch. This is all the great influence to the devotion of the Lord. It is not only limited to this extent, When Hiranyakashyapa, himself, raised his sword to kill him, the ocean of mercy loving Lord could not check Himself and appeared out of the pillar bursting it and having killed Hiranyakashyapa said to Prahlad—‘O son! I am delayed to reach. You had to suffer a lot on account of Me, so, My fault needs to be forgiven.’ But Prahlad was a very eminent devotee, how could he assume the Lord’s fault; he felt the Lord’s mercy even in His delay. Then, Prahlad prayed hymns in the praise of the Lord. Then, being pleased the Lord said—‘O Prahlad! May you be blessed! I am pleased with you. Demand any boon what you want. It is I to fulfil all the ambitions of mankind.’ </p>
<p class="Text">Then Prahlad said—‘O Lord! my caste is lustful by nature, don’t give me allurements of boons. The man who demands the worldly enjoyments and comforts from You even to get Your sight is not Your servant but a businessman. O Lord! The lust causes a great disaster when the desires are created, the sense organs, mind, soul, body, morality, patience, intelligence, shame, property, lustre, memory and truth all are destroyed. So, O God! O the Supreme among the boon givers! if you are pleased to grant me boon according to my will, then, grant me boon to be free from the aspirents of ambition, this is the boon what I demand from you.</p>
<p class="Text">O Children! Mind it that by the influence of Devotion Prahlad, although born in the demon-family got the Supreme position to become the unselfish exclusive devotee of the Lord. This is the form of Prahlad’s devotion—</p>
<p class="SHLOK">श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम्। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption"> (Shrimadbha. 7/5/23)</p>
<p class="Text">‘(1) To hear the names, praises and stories of Lord Vishnu (2) chant them, (3) to remember Him (as well as His names and stories), (4) to wait upon Him, (5) to offer worship (6) salutation to Him, (7) to dedicate one’s actions to Him, (8) to cultivate friendship with him and (9) to offer one’s own body as well as one’s dependants and belongings to Him—these are the nine features of Prahlad’s devotion.’</p>
<p class="Text">If it is not possible, only to remember His names, to offer worship to Him and to meditate Him can also lead us to the supreme state after death.</p>
<p class="Text">There are thousands of names of the Lord. You can remember Him by any name what pleases you or which is your liking; He has numerous forms, you can offer your worship or meditate to His that form what is favourite to you whether it is formless without attributes or the form with attributes, but He is All-pervading, (omnipresent) omnipotent, the ocean of love, mercy, etc., virtues. Thus, having understood His attributes and majesty well, His worship or meditation should be practised only then. If His worship and meditation is beyond possible then only His names should be remembered repeatedly. By the practice of repeating His names only, by His grace His meditation can be possible without any effort automatically. By the practice of only remembering His names constantly daily with unselfish motive with love and devotion, all the sins, demerits, vices and sorrows having been destroyed and all the virtues and moral conduct having been inculcated automatically, man becomes pious and virtuous and at last attains the Supreme Bliss and eternal peace.</p>

<p class="Text">Because, to remember the Lord’s names repeatedly is superior to all the ‘Yagyas’. The Lord has explained about His form—</p>

<p class="Shlok-Right-caption">(Gita <span class="char-style-override-3">10/25)</span></p>
<p class="Text">‘I am the ‘Japa Yagya’ (to remember the Lord’s names) among all the Yagyas.’ </p>
<p class="Text">And Manuji praising the utterance of Name has approved the ‘Japa Yagya’ superior to all the ‘Yagyas.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">विधियज्ञाज्जपयज्ञो विशिष्टो दशभिर्गुणैः। </p>
<p class="SHLOK">उपांशुः स्याच्छतगुण: साहस्रो मानसः स्मृतः॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Right-caption para-style-override-5"> (2/85)</p>
<p class="Text">‘Japa-Yagya’ is ten times superior to ‘Vidhi-Yagya’ (to offer oblation to fire), ‘Upansu-Japa’* (the pronunciation may not be heard to other) is one hundred times superior to ‘Vidhi-Yagya’ and ‘Manasa-Yagya’ (to remember the Lord’s names in mind) is said to be one thousand times superior.</p>
<p class="xfootnote">* To remember the Lord’s names in such a way that the pronunciation may not be heard to others is called ‘Upansau-Japa.’</p>
<p class="SHLOK">ये पाकयज्ञाश्चत्वारो विधियज्ञसमन्विताः। </p>

<p class="Text">‘The four <span class="char-style-override-1">‘Paka Yagya’</span> (Vaishvadeo, Homa, Nitya-Shraddha and food to the guest) including ‘Vidhi-Yagya’ are not even equal to the sixteenth part of ‘Japa-Yagya’.</p>
<p class="Text para-style-override-3">So, if nothing more may be possible, at least the meditation of Lord’s form or only the repeated pronunciation of the Lord’s names must be practised regularly after  comprehending of the Lord’s virtues and glory of the repeatation of Names alone positively always, at all times should be done.<span></span></p>
