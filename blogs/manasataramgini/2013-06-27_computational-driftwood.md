The above object is a gnarled piece of driftwood. Only that it never
floated in the sea and exists only in the virtual realm – a pure
mathematical abstraction – a combination of three functions. Some would
say it is an ultimate vindication of Platonism or the entities of
shuddha-bhuvanAdhvan. In any case it raises the issue of whether natural
form suggests that mathematical entities are merely discovered, i.e., a
connection with that Platonic shuddha-shR^iShTi, or are invented for
describing nature, or is merely a reflection of a deep-rooted tendency
for pareidolia.
