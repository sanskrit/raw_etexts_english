## CXXXVI

*To Ishwar Chandra Ghosh*

MATH, BELUR  
HOWRAH DIST.

*6th March '99*

MY DEAR SIR,

Many thanks for your kind invitation. I am so sorry that so many days'
delay should occur in reply to your note.

I was very ill at the time, and the gentleman on whom the duty fell of
replying could not do it, it seems. I got notice of it just now.

I am not yet sufficiently recovered to take advantage of your kindness.
This winter I had made it a point of visiting your part of the country.
But my Karma will have otherwise. I will have to wait to give myself the
pleasure of visiting the seat of civilisation of ancient Bengal.

With my thanks again for all your kindness, I remain,

Yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
