It is often said that he said ‘joto mot toto poth'(As many faiths, so
many paths). However,from reading Sri Ramakrishna Kathamrita,one of the
earliest unbiased records on his life,we find a more nuanced picture
than the uncritical universalism a lot of people(secularists of
Bengal,Ramakrishna mission monks themselves,etc).

He also says next after that

> It’s like going to the Kali temple on different roads. Even so, some
> paths are pure, while others are dirty. One must take a pure
> path.cvama

Are paths like Islam or Christianity pure?No. Since they are explicitly
vedaviruddha and brAhamaNaviruddha. As nArAyaNa utters in the kUrma
purANa:na vedabAhye puruShe puNyalesho’ pi sha\~Nkara(kUrma purANa
1.15.109). The kUrma also advises

> वेदनिन्दारतान् मर्त्यान् देवनिन्दारतांस्तथा /  
> द्विजनिन्दारतांश्चैव मनसापि न चिन्तयेत् // कूर्म पुराणम् २्.१६्.१६//
>
> vedanindāratān martyān devanindāratāṃstathā /  
> dvijanindāratāṃścaiva manasāpi na cintayet // kUrma purANa 2.16.16//

So such paths would squarely fall in the domain of ‘impure’ paths,and by
Ramakrishna’s standard,to be avoided for sAdhakas. Even in the domains
of Astika sAdhanA,Ramakrishna himself was deprecatory of practices
involving miThuna(though he did vAmAchAra sAdhana on a pa\~nchamuNDi
Asana). He again says

> Narendra refers to the Tantrik sects of Ghoshpara, Panchanami and
> others. Thakur describes their practices and condemns them. He says,
> “They can’t follow spiritual practices correctly. They just satisfy
> sensual desires in the name of religion.”
>

Note the use of physical force to evict those averse to devotion.

His preferred path as noted elsehwere in the Kathamrita

> The path of devotion enjoined by Narada is best suited to this age.

And he truly was an embodiment of that mArga. As seen from quotes like

> It(Kashi) brings
> liberation[\[10\]](https://www.kathamrita.org/kathamrita/volume-3-section-21#_ftn10),
> dear. But I don’t want liberation, I want only love and devotion for
> God

guNarahitam kAmanArahitam pratikShaNavardhamAnam,,,,says nArada in his
sutras. A bhakta does not have even mokSha-kAma,what to speak of worldly
kAmas.

> I have seen so many faiths, so many paths. Now I don’t like them
> anymore – they just argue with each other.

This corresponds well with the sutras vAdo nAvalambayaH\| and
bAhulyAvakAshatvAdaniyatvAt\| of the nArada bhakti sutras(The sAdhaka
should not take to disputation,for it leads to endless arguments and no
certain conclusion).

And when Ramakrishna spoke about ‘harmony between religions’ it was
usually situations like this

> This book contains beautiful stories of devotees. But the book is
> dogmatic. It runs down other beliefs.

Is someone who condemns even the mild sectarianism of the bhaktamAla is
going to accept the sectarianism inherent in the Mosaic
counter-religions exemplified by Islam,etc?

> One holy book of the Vaishnavas is the Bhaktamala. It is a beautiful

His references to harmony were usually of this nature. Scarcely between
even Bauddha upAsanA,let alone hostile counter-religions which seek to
uproot our traditions. It points to an immense loss of common sense when
Ramakrishna’s remarks are extended beyond their intent(ativyApti-dosha).

As for the alleged practice of Islam and Christianity,I have found no
mention of any Christ-centred sAdhanA,and he only repeated Islamic
mantras for a few days given by a certain Govind Rai. It’s extremely
unseemly to ignore his central legacy(of that of a nAradIya style bhakta
to devI
[bhava-tAriNI](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DpsXdopW0AAMUN0.jpg),disparaging
vAma and other impure paths) and instead paint him as someone who was
lacking in discrimination. Shri Ram Swarup deals with this issue [better
than I could in his book on this
affair](https://archive.org/details/Identity_201605/page/n9).
