NO. 1 - IWO COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTIONS OF THD TIME OF MAHENDRAPALA OF KANAUJ, 
BT PROFESSOR F KIELHORN, CIE ; GOTTINGEN, TN February 1904 Mr Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha of Udaipur in R&zputina most kindly 
sent me photographs of two Sanskrit inscriptions on copper-plates, which had bøen found some years before at Uba, a town in the southernmost part of the peninsula of Kathiâ råd, in the Junagadh State! Both inscriptions are of the reign of the Maharajudhuriga Mahendrapala or, ug he is called in one of them, Mahendräyudhe, of Kanau), and record grants to & temple of the Snn by two feudatories of his, Balavarman and his son Avanivarman II. Yoga, who belonged to a Chalukya family. One is dated in the (Gupta-] Valabhi year 574, corresponding roughly to AD 893, the other in the (Vikrama] year 956, corresponding to about A D 899 In March 1904 I gave & short account of the contents of these inscriptions, in Nachrichten d K Gee d Wiagenschaften au Gottingen, and I have since tried to secure inpressions of the originals Not having succeeded in doing so, I now venture to pubbsh the texts from Mr Ojha's photographs 
A.. Plates of Balavarman; Valabhi-samvat 574, These are two plates, each of which is mscribed on one side only. They contain 36 hues of on the whole woll-preserved writing in Någari characters * The language in Sanskrit, it 19 generally easy to understand, bat ine 17 contains a revente term which I have not yet with elsewhele and am unable to explain Lines 7-9 give two verdes on the fanity of fortune, etc., and the necessity of works of piety, and lines 22-29 aux of the ordinary imprecatory Forses, the rest is in prose 
The msomption records a graut of land by the Mahasamanla Balavarman, the son of Avaruvarman (I), of the Chalukya Iineage, . feudatory, who had obtained the five mahd fabdas, of the Paramabhattaraka Mahardjådhuoja Paramavara Mabondriyudbadeva who meditated on the feet of the PMP Bbôjedēva. From Nakshisapura, Balavarman Informg the various officials and others that, after fasting on the sixth tatha of the bright half of Màgha, he gave the village of Jayapura, belonging to the Nakshinapure group of eighty-four which

After the natal admonition to preserve this gift, and six impre catory perses, lines 29-3$ give the names of twelve witnesses four Brühmaus, foui merchants, and four Mahattura: They are followed by the name of the writer, which can not be read with cei tainty, and this, again, we followed by the date rri- Valabhi-samvat 574 Mugha-suddha 6, the numerals of which are ordinary decimal figures The ansorption, in line 36, ends with the signatures sva-hastó=[tra] fri-Paíba) lavarrimanah | sca-hastal sri-Dhîika, where the second) 87a-hastah 1s preceded by a mark which seems to represent the actual sign-manual of Duinha Who this Dhiłka was, does not appear flom the present inscription, but the grant B makes it probable chat he was a hugh official of the king Malêndrüyadha (Mahöndrapåla), Whoo permission was nocessary for the making of the giant

The inscmption records a grant of land by the Mahúsinunta Avanivarman II), Burnamed Yöga, of the Chilukya race (verse 2) In this race there were two great kings' (maha-mului pati), the brothers Kalle and Mahalla (v 3), the former of whom is eulogized 102 conventional terms (vy 5 and 6) Kalla had a son, whose name cannot be made out with confidouce (v 7), and this chef had a son whose name ended with dhavala, and whose full name perhaps was Tahukadhavals (9) This last named olief destroyed or defeated) in battle a certain Dharma, conquered kungs who were well-known rijdhar aja paramesvaras, and defeated a Karpaţa army (vv. 10 and 11) His soo was Avanıyarman [1] (v 12), and his son, again, was Balavarman (the donor of the grant Å, shore) Balaval man defeated a certain Vishadha (v 16) front whom he took away a pair of big drums (urtlaphakhi), and, by slaying Jagapa and other kings, 'freed the eartłu from the Hûna Tace" (v 17) His son was Avau varman [11 }, also called Yoga (v 18), who routed the armies of a certain Yakshadásai and other kings whose countries Tore uyaded by hum (ve 19 and 20), and pat to thght Dharanivardha (v. 21)

belonged to the Nakshisapura eighty-four (Naksesupura-chaturesite) in the Saurashtra mandala, to a templo of) Tarunådityadêva, located near the river Kanavirikê xn the vicinity of the village of Jayapura! The boundaries of the village were on the east the nllage of Viyaraka, on the south the village of Jayapura, on the west the villages of Senduvaka and Kôrintbelca, and on the north the village of Vavulik. After the usual admonition to preber ve this giftand two imprecator y ver søs, the inscription, in lue 68, ends with the date samvat 956 Afåglid-sude 6, the numerals of which bere also aze ordinary decimal figures. 
The Chalukya chiefs mentioned in the preceding are not known from other 108cmptaong The large Bilhali iuscuipt202, in Ep Ind Vol I p 266, mentions a Chaulukya Avanıvarman whose daughter Nohalâ was married by the Kulachan Chedi king Yuvaraja I Kdytravarsla 
Thut Avariyauman may have been a contemporarya of Avenivarman II Yoga of our grant B, but--- even assuming that the terms Ohalukya and Chauluvya might be used synonymously... he cannot be identical with him, because his father and grandfather were Sadhanya and Simha varman (not Balavarman and Avanīvarman) 
For Balavarmaan, a feudatory of Mahendräyudha (Mahendrapala), the grant A farnishes a date in about A D 893 We therefore may assume that his grandfather Vahukadhavala (2) Izved aboat the middle of the 9th century AD, and was almost certainly a fendatory of Mahên drapâle's predecessor Bhöjadêva (Mıhıra) of Kanauj, for whom we possess dates from A D 843 to AD 881 Now in tbe inscription No 77 of my Southern Lest this Mahua (Bhoradhya) 18 stated to have been defeated by the Gujarit Råshtraků ta Dhruvarāja II This at any rate vonld show that he was at war with the Râshtrekâtas, and I believe that such a war 18 actually zeferred to in the account of Vahakadhavala's (?) exploits related in the grant B In my opinion, the Karnata army which 18 Said to have boon defeated by hin can only have been au army of the Rashtrakūtas. As regards (the king) Dharma who is stated to have been destroyed (or defeated) by the same chief, I know of no king Dharma who could have been a contemporany of his, excepting the well-known Påla kug Dharmapáls, and I see no reason why Dharma should not be identified with that PAla king, who at one time or another undoubtedly was at war with the rulers of Kapsu)

The place Nakshipupura, the nine villages mentioned in connection with the two gianta, and the river Konavinka I have not, Ilegiet to say, been able to identify the main point of general interest connected with these localities 18, that the Nakahisapure group of paghty four, which was held by the two donors, according to the incorption B belonged to the Sourashtra mandala Tho nene Surashtra we know to denote the southorn pait of Kathrůvåd. and since the two chiefs Balavarman and Ayanvarnau 11 describe themselves as feudatories of the Maharajadhiraja Mahêndriyudhadhva oz Mahendra puladava (of Kanau), it follows froaz thote inscriptions that towards the end of the 9th century AD the kingdom of Kapauj extended as far south as, and included, the province of Käthiâvåd Moreover, it becomes quite cortain now that the Rajadhiraja Mahipáladérs, who in the Haddala plates of A D 914 18 mentioned as the oreilord of the Chapa Jahilftimantádhırpałe Dharanivarala, must be identi bed with the Mohárájádharázu Makipuladéve of Kanau) (whose Abni auscription Is dated an about AD 917), the successor of Mahendi a paladóra, and cannot have been one of the Chudasamas of Gimar-Junagadh 
In the grant & the king, knowu to us from the grant B and other inscnptions as Diabet drapala, 18 called Mahondráyudha This pane of course at once recalls the names Indrá yudha and Chakrüyudbs, the formei denoting a king xbo according to the Hartvamsa Purina waa raling the north 1 Saka-gainyat 705=AD 783-54, and the latter another king, to whion the sovereigaty of Mahodaya (KA2823) was given, after the defeat of Indra1ija (26, in my opinion, Indrayudha), by the Pala Dharmepåla, and who was defeated by Nagabhata, the grand father of Bhöjadêya of Kanaaj It niay also be mentioned that in Rajasekhara's Kurpúru. axuñjari & certain mierchant la represented as having gone to Kazan), the capital of Vajrā. yudhe, the king of Panchdia' That story would seem to show that in the opinion of Raja sêb hara, who was Mahendra påla's guru, a name with the somewhat unusqal ending ayudhai, such as Vajrayudha, wa8 & suitable or characteristic name of a Kapau; kung Host probably Malêndrapala himself was known to R&jaśêkbera also by the name lahendrayudha

The object of the inscription 18, to record that a queen named Lâbini, s younger sister of the Paramara Púrnapala and widow of a king Vigrahardje, at Vataa (Vata-nagara, Vats pura) zeatored an ancient temple of the Sun, and sestored or founded a tank (vupi), apparently the very tank where thzb zecord has been found And the 11scription is divided into three parts, the first and second of which give the genealogies of Lâhipi and Vigiabardja, while the third glouties the town Vata and the prous work executed there by the widowed queen The whole sa introduced by two ver ses, in one of which (so far as it is preserved) the author pays homage to Maheśvara (Sita), Príchêtaga (the poet Valmiki), and Vini (the goddess of eloquence), while in the other he uvokes the protection of the god Harı (Vishau) 
Verse 3 relates that through the anger of (the sage) Vasiehtha there was produced a youth or punce (hundra) from whom the Pramars (or Paramara) family took its 0129ın 3 In hy lineage there was Utpalaråja ; from him sprang Aranyarâja, and from him Adbhutakrishna Taja His son (or, if a name should have been lost at the commencement of line 4, his son's son) was Mahipala, and from bim sprang Dhandhuka To Dhandhuka there was born from his wife Amritadovi Pürnapala, who ruled the Arbuda territory (bha-mamdalant- Arbbudasa) * 
In his reign, his younger sister Lähini was mariied by king Vigraha (Vigrabaraja),

If the Cbatiavihana of the best Kigga 106cupton was really the same person as the Chitraváha of the Sorab plates, it would follow that the Alupa o âlua prince Gunesagara was governou of the Kadamba-mandala, r e the Banayah2 porince, in or immediately before the time of the Western Chalukya king Vinapiditya, and that Gunasigara's son Åla varája Chitragába or Chitrayabana (1) granted two villages in the distiict of Edevolal, which formed part of the Bazavâsı province, during Vinayaditya's reign Consequently Chitravehane I seems to have succeeded his father Guuaságara in the government of Banavåsi In the fame of Govinda IIT, however, the Benavåbi-mandala had been taken from the Alupas and was entrusted to Rajaditya, while the Aluvakheda siz-thonband was administered by a second Chitraváhane, who on the strength of ba dawe way be assumed to have belonged to the Alupa family To judge fron the Mávali inscription, ho proved troublesome and had to be coerced by the force of arms That Chidayahana, whom the second Kigga Inscription mentions as lesiding at Bumcha, may or

ALUPA INSCRIPTIONS AT UDIYAVARA 
district Of these records I now edit the eight nuost complete and important ones Regaz ding some dificalt points in them I have consulted my old friends Venkayya and Kuishna Sastri, whose remarka pioved of much assistance in ani avelling the meauing of these enigmatical ancient doodments 
The first five Udiyivara inscriptions are on Virakals, % e stones Bot up as memonals of deceased heroes, the remaining three refer to grants of tolls The three first inscriptions must all belong to the same period, for Nos I and II montion & certain Ranasågara, and Nos II and III one syötavähend. These two names and, in addition to them, Chitravábana in No I look like those of Aluye puinces, among whom we have already found a Gunagågana and two Chatraváhange. As the alphabet iesembles that of the Måval Inbcription, we may identify the Olutra våbana of No I with Chitravébana II, who ruled the Âluvakheda eix-thousand in the time of Govinda III Consequently Non I -III, must be assigned to about A D. 800, From the first few lines of No I wo learn that Chitraváhana II seized Udyåvara in the course of a war with Ranasâ gaz, who seems to have been a nival claimant to the th and III refer to the storming of Udiyå vara by Syötavlhund, and No II, records the death, on the occasion, of a follower of Ranasågara. From this ut mey perhaps be concluded that, after the time of the insorption No 1, Rapasigara succeeded in ousting Chitravahana II , bat that, later on, he was n bis turn defeated by Svêta påhana, who may have been a pear ielative of Olutravabana II 
The remaining Udigáfara inscriptions date from the reigns of the two Âlupa, Álura or Älvs kungs Pfathin sângara (Nos IV-VI) and Vijayaditya (Nos VII and VIII) altas Mâramma (No VII) It is 22 possible to say at pregent how these two princes were connected with Chitra và hana II, Ranasagara and Svatavahana But, as the alphabet of their inscriptions agrees with that of Nos I-III, they must be designed to about the same period 
In each of the eight subjoined inscriptions Udiyâval a la referred to by one of its older names Udayapura (Nos V. and VIII ), Udayapura (Nos II, III, VI, VII) or Udeyapura (Nos I and IV) In the three lugt ut 18 mentioned together with Pati (No VI), Pombulcha (No VII) OF Ponvuloha (No VIII) Pati and Pombuchcha are known to have been ancient names of the modern Humoha in the Nagar taluka of the Shimoga district * This Hamcha seems to have been the capital of the Alupa kings For an 18soriptiob at Kigga 16 dated while Chatraváhana (II ) was ruling Ponbachchu 3

This inscription (No 94 of the Government Epigrapbist's collection for 1901) in engravell on en octagonal pillar in front of the Sambhukallu temple at Udıyavara It records that follower of Chitravihana (II) met with his death when the lord of the earth' (vix Chitra vihana) occupied and entered Udeyapua (Udgårara) daring the troable of Rannsagala, 18 in the course of & war with the latter

VIII Inscription of Vijayiditya. This inscription (No 97 of 1901) is found on the same pillaz as the preceding one (VII) It is engraved on the same two contiguous faces As VII, but begins at the opposite end of the pillar, wuch must have been placed upside down when the new inscription (VIII) Was mcised on it A third face of the pillar bears sex lines of writing (15-20) which appear to be connected with VIII This oircumstance enables us to conolude that VIII was engrayed at a lator date than VII When the writer of VIII had reached line 14, he was confronted with the end of the inscription VII , and was therefore obliged to finish his copy on another face of the pillar 
The contents of VIII resemble those of VII The king is the same, only one of his names, Máramma, 18 omitted here He is stated to have confirmed the same grant of tolls to the two cities of Udayapura (Udiyêvara) and Ponyalcha (Humcha) But the names of the local representatives receiving the great differ fron those in VII This show that some time must have elapsed between the incision of both records, although both belong to the same reiga.

D Morg Ges Vol XL p 322 # They were after wards edited pith hthographs by Dr R G Bhandarkar, with a translation by Mr (20w Prof) SR Bhandarkar, in the Joury Bo Br R As Soo. Yol XVIII 253 ff About three years ago, when Prof Hultzsch first thought of having the inscriptions 1-edited in this Journal, no trace whatever of them conld be found, and it is OU % chance visit to the State Museum at Baroda in 1903 that I saw the plates exbubited thero On my inforraing Prof Haltzsch of their whereabouts, he asked Raz Babadnr Venkayza to obtain them, on loan through the Resident at Baroda from the Ouator of the Baroda Stats Museum, and I 10-edit the inscriptions at the suggestion of P10f Hultzsch, and from the excellent ink-unpressions supplied by Rai Bahadur Venkaysa 
[Along with the two sets of plates, two seals were received from the Resident at Baroda ID December 1903 As the seals had been detached from the plates, it was not possible to ascertain which seal belonged to which set But before returning the plates and seala on tihe 7 tih December 1904, I put down bomo zoteo sbout then, of which the following is a copy. 
[The plates measure on an average 13" by 9" The rings beaning both the seals had been cut before they were received in my office The larger of the two seals measures about 3" by 21". The ring whose ends are becured at the hottom of the seal is 3" in diameter and 1" thick The seal beurs, in rehef on a countersunk surface, as the principal bgure, an image of Geruda--whose wings are distinctly seen squatting on & seat which is probably meant to consist of two serpents These appear to ontwine bus waast and to terminate in his hands, cach of which is holding a hood What looks like his sacred theed is perhaps & third serpent. The Garuda foces to the full front and has on his proper right a representataon of Ganapata in the upper corner, lower down a chauri, and below its lanıp On the proper left in the upper comer 18 a goddeas riding on a lion, and below the lion & svastaka surmounted by a charri On 
d of Garda is a crole which may be meant for the sun and moon Below the squatting Garuda 18 su inscription which 18 not quite distinct, but which seems to bae afermagapa Along the margin of the seal 18 a border of various indistinct emblems, among which a låga and an elephant-goad are recognisable. The snublems on the smaller seal, which menaures about 11" by 11, are also ent in relief on a countersunk surface, but are not quite distinct. The central figaro 19 Garuda, aquatting, as in the bigger seal, apparently on a couch consisting of two serpents, wluich gcom to entomo las waist and to terminate in his nands Each of the hands of Garuda appears to hold a bood What looks like his sacred thread may be a tbud serpent to his picper right at the upper comer is & projection which may stand for Gavaprtı, and below at 10 a lamp stand To the proper left at the upper corner 18 another

projection, which 18 parhaps intended to represent a goddess Below the goddess us a lamp stand above a sastoka The zing whose ends are secured at the bottom of the smaller seal meastres 3" in diameter and " in thickness Two sets of impressions of each of the two inscriptions were sent to Mr D R Bhandarkar 10 Angust 1903 -TV] 
As regards the find-spot of the plates, E I Dhruya, who first edited ther, says ---On the 6th of July 1881, as a Dubla serrant of Maly Khusbal, Patel of Bagumri, was furrowing the earth with the plough in his field, the ploughshare drew oat of it these plates This clearly shows that the plates were found at Bagunrd, and consequently we must, as Tas first Quinted ont by Prof Kielhorn, speak of them as Bagumrå, and not as Nangari, charters of A D 915 
Each of the two sets consists of three copper-plates, wbich are, to judge from the impres sione, about 13" long and 9' broad The inscription is engraved on the inner sides of the first and third plates, and on both sides of the second plate The engraving 19 clear and well executed The characters belong to the northern class of alphabets For some of the forms of indivi dual lettors attention may be drawn to g 10 gatasya and scarggam, 1 13, to ñ in ldächhand, 1 6, and rdiñal, 1 13, to m in m-anyatepu", 1 19, ománandt, 1 37, and grámalaţa, 1 46, to bh in bhúpal, 128, and to gin samtarppando, 1 57, so far as the first record concerned, and to k in kant-end, 1 1, to kch 2n famkha, 1 29, to , in saras-ambhájá, 1 5, and jagati, 17, and to bh in kaustubha, 1 2, so far as the second record 18 Copcorned The language is Sanskrit thronghont In respect of orthography, the following points may be noticed The letter 0 18 throughout denoted by the sign for y, consonants are doubled after *, Vlaarga has been (permissibly) omitted one before the following sth in voksha-sthala, 1 2 of both grezte, I has been substituted for in kanchi, 1 11 of No II , pisarga followed by s has been at least thrioe changed to that letter 10 Ranavgrahas=samabhavao, 1, 33, palakshatas=sôdramgał, 1 51, and lakshats=sürddhark, 1 55 of the second record, anusvåra followed by a pasal has been twice changed to tbat letter in sammanita, 1. 18 of No I and 1 20 of No II, and in goo ängandndarayara-, 1 6 of No 1, the dental nasal has been used instead of an anusvúra before & in sansatt, 1 25 of No I and I. 27 of No II. Lastly, the same wód 18 apolt lanchliana in No I. 1 8, but lunchhand in No II 19. 
Each of these two records registers the grant of a village to a Brahmana, made by the Rashtrakata king Indra III or, as he 16 degenbed in lipes 43-45 of No II, the PHP, the prosperous Nityavarshanarendradêve, who meditated on the feet of the PMP, the prosperous Akalavarshad@ya," ? e his grandfather Krishna II Indra III had, when the grants were made, gone to Kurundaka from his capital Mânyakheta for the pattabandia. festiyal, On that occasion be had himself weighed against gold, and, without coming ont from the pan, gave away, together with twenty lakhs and a half of drammas, Kurundake and other villages, granted afresh four hundred villages resumed by previous rulers, and finally bestowed the village of Tenna, according to No II, on a Brahmana of the Lakshmana gôtra, a student of the VÂ31-Mdhyandina sákhd, and named Siddhapabhatta, the son of Sri-Vennapabhatte, aligmally of Fataliputra ; and the village of Omavari (or Umbara), according to No. I, on a Brahmana of the same gotra and student of the same salcha as the above granted, but named Prabhakarabbatta the son of Ranapabhatta. The charters are dated, in words, on the 7th tithi of the breht fortnight of Phålguna of the Yuva-samvataars, the Saka year 838 (expired), which corresponds to the 24th February A D. 916.

If we read between the Ines, we cannot fail to notice that the Rashtrakatau sovereignty bad been shaken by the Chalukyas of Vlogi to its very foundations in the early part of Amoghavasha's reign The Chalukya contemporary of Amoghavaisha I was Narênciamrgarija-Vijaşadıtça II, who, un an Eastern Chalukys record, 18 represented to have fought, dunng tirelye years, by day and night, a hundied and eight battles with the armies of the Gangas and the Rattus The latter cau be no other than the Rashtrakatas of Balkhed, and it thus appears that Narendramngal118

Govardham-oddatira and hél-ônmülita-Merri, tined in connection with the kings Upendra and Indrarāja iespectively, are to be interpreted, is far from clear At one time I thought that Upöndra referied to Mahipals of the Pratihara dynasty of Bahodaya, for whom I then contended that the Bhagalpur grant of the Pala dynasty gave the other name Chakrayadha! But I hare stated above that, beyond all doubt, Dharmapala and Chakráyudha, whom be re-instated on the throne, wei e contemporaries of the Rashtrakůta prince Govinda III” Chakrayadha cennot, therefore, be identified with Mahipåla, who was a contemporary of India III., the great-great grandson of Govinda III According to Pandit Bhagwanlal Indralık the word Mému in thu expression hél-onmúluta-fra signifles Måra or Mehra, and the whole espression speaks of the defeat of some contemporary Mehra king of North Kéthiwad by Indraraj. III Prof Kielhorn, on the other hand, holde tbat Meru probably s Mahodayat 1 e Kananj, implying thereby that it records the captare of Kanau] by Indrarája III, specified in the Sangli charter With regard to the other expression, l.uz krita-Govardhan-oudhara, no interpretation has been proposed, and we must wat for the publication of other placriptions to enable us to understand perfectly the historical sense of this verse. 
In the presnuble of the prose passage preceding the formal part of the inscription, the P. M P Sriman-Nityavarshanarendradeya, 1 e Indraurája III, 18 apoken of as a meditating on the feet" of the P P P. Srimal-Akalavarshadova, a e, his grandfather Krishna II Th18 indicates that Jagattunga, the father of Indraråja III, did not come to the throne The sand may be concluded from the statement of our inscriptions that the battles of Kpushparaja II wero remembered and descrabed by old men in Indra III 's time This shows that hardly a generation had paased once the ocenitence of that event, and that consequently there was no Ráshirakata sovereign intervening between Krishna II. And Indra III The same conclusion is pointed to by the fact that the Khirëpåtan grant of Rattardja, u setting forth the Roshtrakata genealogy, takes the succession direct from Krishna II to Indra III. and refers to Jagattuage only further on as the father of Amoghavarsha-Vaddiga But our conclusion is placed beyond all doubt by the Deðli and Karbid plates of Krislina III , which distinctly speak of Jagattuóga as having died without obtaining the sovereignty. 
The composer of our inscriptions was Trivikramabhatte, the son of Némåditya. There caa bazdly be a doubt that he is identical with Inyikramabhatta, the author of the Nalachampd, of the Śåndıya götra, and the son of Nênåditya (var let Dévaditya)? Another Sándılya kavrohakravartur Trivikramx was the sixtih ancestor of the astronomer Bhaskarabhattea contemporary of kug Bhôja of Dhårâ The oldest mention of Trivikrama 18 in Bhoja B Sarasvatikanfhabharana, while ha hiraself quotes Båda.

The object of the inscription 19 to record the grant of the village Khaddikâ in the Katerak& district (23) to a temple of the San god at Chattulliba ( 29 f ) by king Jayavardbana II. It was sucd from srivardhanapura (1 I) and 18 dated in the 3rd year of his reign on the 30th day of the monti Kurttika (1 46 and 31). Judging from the writing it may be assigned to the eighth century A.D , the characters very much resemble those of the Paithan plstes of Gâviuda III dated in the year 794 A D Jayavardhana II 25 de scribed in lines 20-22 a devotee of Mahdśpers, tbe lord of the whole Vindhya, and Alahůrdjidhartiya Puram esvara He belonged to the Bailavamsa (verge 1) His grandfather, who bore the same name as lumself, killed the former king of the Vindhya and made the Vindhya his residence (v 3) The son of Jayavardhana I and father of the donor was Brvardbade II., who styled hiuself Vindbyesvara (v 4), and who may have founded Slivardhanapura from sphich the present charter was issued Five more ancestors of this Ime are mentioned, the fret of whom wae Srivardhana I His son was Prithuvardhana, who 18 stated to hape attacked Gujarat (v. l) In his family was boru Sauvardbana (F 2), one of whose three sons killed the king of Paundrak (Bengal and Bihar), while another conquered the king of Kåsi (Benares) Of this latter, whose name is not mentioned, Jayavardhan8 I. Fus the son (~ 3) 
The first perse of this charter openg with an obscura opithet to Srivardhana I who is called Kalts-achala-tunga-śringa-uspula-dronija-tamso-prabhuh, which apparently means the loid of the family of her who was born in the great valley of the lofty peaks of the Kalea mountain' It is very difficult to hit at the true import of this expression, and the only Contecture I can hazard za that it may mean tue Gangavamsa, of which the Saulavamsa wag probably a branch of a more well known name at that time Otherwise it is difficult to see why 10 te 84119 Verse the same person should be called the lord or ornament of two families If my conjecture 19 correct, the force of prakhyito blutur (famous or known on the earth) preoeding Agrlaramga-talakun pould be apparent The Sallayamsa 18 very probably identical with the Sarlódbhavas or $118dbhavas of Orissa, to which Prof Hiltzsch has kindly drawn by attention in the plates of the time of Sašinkaraja, a feudatory chief Midhaverâja II, who 1892ed the charter, ze spoken of as belonging to the Sulõdbhave family, which is identical with the Salddblaya of the Bugada plates of Midhayavarman pointed out there The former 18 dated in the year 619-20 AD and 18 the older of the two Both were found in the Ganan distinot, and both the charters wero inated from Kôngéda or Karagöda, which is identified by Prof Kielhorn with the Kong-u-t'os of the Chinese traveller Hrven Tszang, who visited the place in the year 689 AD 8 Tbia principality was included in the Kalinga country or, roughly speaking, Orias. In fact the village granted by Madhavargjo II was situated ia the distnot of Krishnagiri, a synonym of Nilagin which is a name of Jagannatha (Puri) in Or185a7 And it 18 well known that Om888 2x the contry where the Gångavamba originated King Indiafarman of Kalinganagara 28 spoken of as the establishor of the spotless famıy of the Gångas,' an epithet which does not occur in other grants of the Cangas of Kalmga. So he Was & porpotuator of a dynasty with a new name, which probably he introdaced in preference to an old one which was not very complimentary The new damo 18 & motronymic, so we may sappose that the one suppressed was a patrynyn The Baguda inscription tells us how one Palindaséna worshipped Brahm 10 ordei to create a fit ruler for the land, and how the god guanted his wish by creating out of a rook the lord Sailodbhaya, who became the founder af the family of that ramo However complimentary the story may have been u the beginning,

castes, whica trace their origin to some such inanimate objects 48 scarecrows, dirt from Mah&dêya's body, or the sweat of his brow In fact the aboriginal Gonda &ver that their leader Iango liberated the first men of the tribe from # Cape in the Iron valley in the Red hil by removing a stone 16 cnbits high with which Mahadeva had closed the mouth of the cave, and out came 16 scores of Gonds at oncel The Sailodbhava origin would thus appear something like an improvement on this story Recognising the tendency, wbich las always existed and still exista, to adopt eponymous names under the infaenda of what Sir Alfred Lyall calls the gradual Brahmanising of castes, it would not be surprising to find & family with a dabious patronymic ingingating a non-Brahmanical ongin, preferring a metronymio connected with 80 boly a doity as the Ganges, un spite of the Kshatriya mode of calling thoraselves after the male parent It will then be asked why in the present grant the Sarlavansa pas at all mentioned, to which an answer may be found in the fact that there are always three classes of people the conservatives or those who would shok to the old things only, the moderates who would tolerate both the new and the old, and the extremists who would wholly discard the old, and probably the donor of the present grant belonged to the second olags All this is, however, extremely hypothetical, and I only hazard it in the hope that a better explanation may be forthcoming. By the way I may mentaon that it was the Gångavamsa kings of Oriaga who revived Sno-worship and built many temples dedicated to that deity, and again most of the offiorals, such as samahartri and sannidhátrı (1 24), are those chiefly found in the grants of Origes langs These are other items in support of the donor's family connection with On18sa, 
With regard to the places mentioned in the grant, I identify Khaddıká with Khadi, a village three miles north-east of Ragholi where the plates were found It is only & Sanakritised Dame like Lañjikis for Lanjl, which 18 also not very far away from this place. Kateraks is probably the present Katera near Katangi, 60 miles west of Raghoh I cannot dentify Chatgulliha, unless it is a mistake for Raghulliha or Ragbol, where the plates have been found With the elision of & little stroke in the first letter, and giving a slightly alanting poahon to the second, the word would read as Ragholzha Tlus may find support from the fact that the engraving of the grant is very defective, and that several other mistakes have been committed in lines 33, 40, 44, eto I cannot find in the Central Provinces a place answering to Srivardhang pura. It could not be Srivardhana in the Bombay Presidency, the famous seaport referred to by European travellers as Zutardan sad celebrated as the birth-place of the firat Peshwa.* From what has beon stated above, the family would seem to have come from & seaport in the east rather than from the west Bat the place must be searched for zeerer home, and it may be that at 18 How Don-existent The probability is that it was situated somewhere near Råmtek in the Nagpur district Five miles from this place there is a village called Nagardhan which was known as Nandivardhana in olden times, and local traditions country was raled from that place by Kshatriya Rajag & The village contains ancient remains and is mentioned as the name of & district togathor with Någpur in the Debli plates of the RAshtrakůta king Knehna III. dated in the year 940 A.D.7 It 18 plaan therefore that

Nandiyazdhana must have been a place of great importance before it gave its name to the district I hold that this as fogaded by & onccossor of Jayavardhana II, who removed the capital from Srivaidbangpara, also named after a king of the same line, to the place to which he gave bir own name? The Rashtrakūtas roge in power on this side in the eighth century, and it la probably they who displaced the Sallayainsa dynasty of the Vindhya mountains Nandipar dhana or Nagardhana is about 100 miles froin Ragholi, and both were inoluded za the same distret about a century ago It may also be stated that, so far as I have been able to find, there are DO other villages ending 10 varilhana in Balaghat or any of the surrounding distnots, and the name 39 80 peculely differcot from those of other villages in the locality that at may almost be called inique, for these reasons the location of Siivardhanapura round about Nandıvardhana or Rømtek cailles at least a certaiu probability with it

«These are five copper-plates, measuring 91" hy about 477". The first and last plates bear writing only on ther inner side and have raised is about the bigh only on their engraved side The three remaining plates, which boar writing on both sides, have rims of the same haght projecting on both sides Through holes (3" in diameter), bored on the left margin of each plate, as passed & circular ring, which appears to have been cut and re-soldered before the platos came into my handa Thering measures 54" 20 diameter and is a little more than a thick. Its enda, which are slightly thmner, are secured in the upper part of an expanded lotus flower of sight petals. To the lower part of the same lotus, which is fashioned into a nm-lke projection, 18 soldered & ciroular seal, which moastres 21" in diameter and is nearly f" thick It bears, in relief on a countersunk surface, the legend Sri-Tribhuvananku[sa] in the centre, in characters anular to those of the inscription.

The following orthographical irregularities deserve to be noted Against Oden? Pånızı's rules (VIII 4, 40) the sh of varsha 18 doubled u 11 8 and 11, but not in Il. 13, 14, 25 and 40 Some spellings are due to the Telugu pionunciation Thus we find yatad (1 57, for ead, yuttara (11 54 f and 57, but not in 1.59) for uttara, rahshanuyayra (1 47 f) f rakshandy-arva, aruha (1. 50) for arha, Icrushta (139) for krishna Dental 28 employed instead of lingual ? in Keranapuram and Irislina (1. 43), punya (1149, 50), ábhurana (II 40 53), ganesa (1. 50), yuttarayana (1 54 f). The vowel ri 11 ieplaced by 92 in krishna (1 43) sadrid ( 52) ænd krtud (1 56) The palatal dibilant in improperly used in samha (1. 50) for tamgha and dadrud (1 32) for sadışó 
The language in Sanskrit prose, inter spersed with 20 Sanskrit verses In II 56-60 SOLE names of villages, tanks and fields appear in the Telugu forms at the end of the record the usual imprecatory varses and the names of the Ajfapti, composer and wute are missing 
As the inscription records & grant to a Jaida, temple, it openg with an invocation of il Jaine religion (v 1) LL 3-41 contain the genealogy of the Eastern Châlukya dynasty dowt to Samastabhuvanátruya Vijayaditya (VI) or Angarija (II ), the date of whose coi Onatzen is given in the same two verses (13 € ) as in his Padankalin gmat 1 The genealogical porbm contains two passages of bastolical importance, the first (L 13-16) describing the reigu d Vijayaditya III , and the second (li 22-32) the accession of Chilukya-Blima II 
The Pithapuram insonption of Mallapudêgu reports that Vijayaditya III. slew Mangirija bumt Chakrakůta, terrified Sankila, residug in Killnapuis and juined by Krishna, restored hele dugaity to Vallabhandra, and received elephants 18 tribute from the king of Kalinga % The slag qug of Mangi is leferred to also in three other 115Ciptions : The second of theu adds the bord ing of Kiranapara, and the third states that tho king, having terified Krishna and Sankule, completely burnt their city Hitherto we did not know who Blangi and Sankıls were Vers 8 of the Malıyapünçı grant calls the former * the king of the great Nodaraba-räshtia' and the hecond “the lord of the excellent Dachnlla' Thu Maggi scems to have been one of the Palla vas of Nolambuvidit and Sankua an early chief of Dahala (ox Cudi) While two of the above mentioned inscriptions couple the name of Sankila with that of Krishna, the Maliyapůndı 
that Sankıl& Was joined by the fierce Vallabha' The Nellore Distru Inscriptrons (p. 109, note 5) correotly conclude from this that Sankila's ally Krighra was labha, e a Rabtrakūta Hence wy fougier identification of this Kriabue with the Paramin king Krishnarajus must be wrong, and he may be identified, as was done by Dr Fleed, with the Rashtraktit sing Krishna II. The latter is known to have been connected with the Chki famıly, being the son-in-law of Kokkalla (I ) and the brother-in-Inw of Sankuka? I feel sa beatahon in ideutifying Sankila of Dahala with Sankuka (or Sankaragana) of Chedi, the sou of Kokkalla I, but am unable to identify Kiranapura, where Sankıla resided according to the

MALIY APUNDI GRANT OF AMMARAJA II 
Pathapuram inscription and Krishnaraja according to the Maliyapandi grant (F 15) In two grauta the burning of this Kiranapura, the readence of Krishna and Sapkla, ja attributed to Vijayaditya III himself Verse 15 of the Maliyapindı grant informs us that this feat was in reality performed by a military officer named Pindaranga It is perhaps worth noting that another Rashtrakúta prince named Krishnaraja is mentioned in a grant of A,D 888,8 Between the slaying of Mangi and the victory over Sankile the Maliyapûndı grant mentions that Vija Faditya III defeated the Gangas who took refuge on the peak of Gangakûta' As suggested in the Nellore District Inscriptions (P 169, note 3), this statement may or may not bo & mere variant of one in the Pithapuram inscription, according to which the king burnt Chakrakūta * He is elsewhere said to have defeated the unequalled Gangas ' Hinally the new grand reports that Vijayaditya III bore the surname Parachakrarama (1 14) 
The Malpapûndı grant gives & yiyd description of the struggles that took place after the death of Vikramaditya II Five years passed in continual wars between the rival olaimants, among whom Yuddhamalla, Rajamêrtanda and Kanthika-Vijayiditya are mentioned by name Then Rajabhima (or Chalukya-Bhima II ) sacceeded in restoring order hy slaying Räjamârtauda, defeating and banishing Kantkıká-Vijayâditya and Yuddhamalls, and killing many other rebels Yuddhamala (II) 28 the son of Tila, tothom one grant of Chalukya Bhima II attributes a reign of seven years, while two other grants, like the Maliyapandi graut, take no oficial notice of his reigo Rajamârtaņda is parhaps the same as Rayamayya in the Kaluchambarru grant, & and he is mentioned also in the Kolavennu plates In editing these plates I commatted muistake, which has been endorsed by Dr Fleet10 and Prof. Kielhora, 11 in takang Rajam ártanda as a surnama of Châlnkya-Bhina II As stated in the Nellore District Insomptions (p 170, noto ), the Malıyapûndı grant now shows that Rájamirtanda was a distinct person Dr Fleet has already noticed that I 17-19 of the Kolavednu plates contain a verse, l* the first half of which I would now, with the help of his remarks, correct as follows -- 
ografaret e f Efafoor RTTET [1*] Thas the verae mentions four enemies of Chalukya-Bhima II-Tâtabikyada, Dhaladi (or Dhalsga), Munmugiya and Rajamärtanda Kanthzka-Vijayaditya, whom the king banished along with Yuddhamalla II., w undoubtedly the same as Kanthikâ-Béta or Vijayaditya V, the son of Amma I and the ancestor of the Eastern Chalukyas of Pithapuram lå 
The subjoined grant was made at a winter Solstice (uttarayana, 1 54 f) The donce was & temple of Jina (Jindlaya) in the south of Dharmapuri (v 17), which was in charge of an priset of the Yâpaniya-eamghali (v 18) It had been founded by the Kafakarija (154) Durgarāja (v 16) and was named Katakábharana-Jinalaya (v 17 and I 53), ayidently after a surname of the founder At his request (154) the grant was made, and the grant portion opens with a pedigree of his family His ancestor Pandarang& 8 stated to have burnt Kiranapura, the residence of Krishnaraja (v 15), and accordingly must have been a miltary officer of Vijay&ditya III.16 His gon Niravadyadhavale was appointed Kafakardja (1 441) His son was the Katakddhipato Vijayaditya (1 45 ), and his son was Durgarije ( 18).

Påndarângs (the Pindarange of y 15) is mentioned as Ajñaptr in a grant of Vijayaditya III 1 The title Katakarája or Kațakechipata, 1 e 'supenotendent of the royal camp,' which was borne by his three lineal descendants, Beems to be peculiar to the court of the Eastern Chalukya kings Dr Fleat remarked that the grants of Amng I and Amma II mention Kalakarta, Katakes as and Katakidhita as Agñaptr, and came to the conclusion that these two words were not proper names, bat mere titles 2 The Malıyapanda grant now showa that in each case they refer to one of the three direct descendanta of Pånderange, wbo bore that tatle, vas. Nurayadyadhavala, Vilayaditya and Durgarija It seems preferabla to take also Kadeyardja in the grant of Chalukya-Bhima I * 49 # vnlgar form of Kufakarija, the title of Vijayaditya, and not as & proper name 
The object of the grant was the small village (grlimatiku) of Maliyapundi (1 55) in the district (vishaya) of Kamma-nându (1 42) Its boundaries sre given in ) 36 f The northern boundary, Dharmavuramu, is the Telugu form of Dharmapuri, to the south of which the Jinalaya was situated (v 17) According to the Nellore District Inscriptions (p 174, note) both Dharmapuram and the western boundary, Kalvakuru, are now in the Addamku dvision of the Ongole täluka Of two macriptions at Dharmavaram (P 966 ff. of the same work) the first mentiong Gangkenalla (Vijayaditya III.), Pândaranga, the buming of Kirazapara, and Dharma ruram An macription at Addankı (p 896 f. of the saine work) also refers to Påndaranya and Dharmavaram Maliyapandı itself, the village granted, does not exist any more at present (abad p 167), but its former position is fixed by the identification of two of its boundaries The district of Kamma-ninda, to which it belonged, is identical with the Kamma-rashtra a Kammaka-rashtra of other inscriptions To my former remarks on this geographical naniet may be added that it occurs as Kammaka-ratha in the Jaggayyapë ta wscriptions of Pumadata 5 This Prakrt form rondcre my suggestion tilat Kammiiko may be meant for Kammánkat uutenable , for the latter would have become in Prakrt Kammanka, and not Kammeka

The inscription consists of eight limus, but it is far from complete About one-fifth of the entire slab is broken away along the propez lett oge, and conscynently lmes 1-7 have each lost i numbei of syllables, which vanee fron nibe to foai teed The filst thee syllables of the tuet line and the first alokara of the second live bare also disappeared owing to a small piece of stone having clipped off from the upper right colbei Tho 10c01d is further damaged by the our faco having more or less peeled oft in the Dargiaal poitrous 
The chwacters of tho 10901iption very closely resenible those of an inscriptiou from Jhalrapitanand are of the ornamental type current in Northern India about the beginning of the eighth century AD Attention must, howerei, be drawn to the letters Uh and y?

Between those two longer records, and subsequently to the second, we have a few shorter wscriptions of the same family, notably the Delhi Siwalk pillar inscriptions of Visaladeva-Vigraharaja of AD 1164, and two short inscriptions on the defeat of the Chandella Palamardidáva by the Chahatahtia Prithri r479 II. of the [Vikrama) yea: 1239=AD 1182 Tho lutast available data for this family 18 tho (Vikrama) year 1241ZAD 11873

when I compiled the Inst My object in wnhng this paper is, to give the genealogy of theso ChAhamanas of Naddale, so far as the documents which lately have come to my knowledge enable me to do so For this purpose I shall give the texts of three inscriptions which the kindness of Dr Fleet and Mr Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha allows me to edit, and an account of the contents of some Mount Abü inscriptions, based on excellent impreggions for which ve have to thank Mr Cousons 
A NADOL PLATES OF ALBANADEVA; [VIKRAMA-J8AMVAT 1218 
These plates were obtained by Colonel Tod in October 1819, at Nadol, a town in the Jodh pur State of Râpatârna, and presented to the Royal Asiatic Society An account of their con tenta was given by him in his Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, Vol IP 804, and the inscription which they contain was edited, in a rather glovenly manner, by Rao Bahadur H I. Dhruva, in Journ, Bombay As Soc Vol XIX p 26 ff I re-edit ut from an excellent photo lithograph, prepared under the superintendence of, and kindly placed at my disposal hy, Dr Fleet 
These are two plates, sach of which measures about 8}" broad by 62" high The first plate 18 anscribed on one side only, and the second on both sides The edges of the inner sides of them are fashioned slightly thicker, so as to protect the writing, and the insorption IS IN & state of perfect preservation. Both plates contain a hole for a ring, but the neg and any seal that may have been attached to it have not been preseryed The characters are Någari The language la Sanskrit, and the greater part of the text is a verse In respect of orthography it wil saffice to state that the letters b and v are both denoted by the sign for v, and that the dental sıbılaxt often used for the palatal The text contains 3 considerable number of clerical mistakes, most of whuch can be easily corrected Other mistakes are shown by the metre to be due to the author himself, who possessed no accurate knowledge of Sanskrit Of these I would point out here merely the wrong samdhı ım. sprihayan=amaratám (for sprihayann-amaratón) in line 17, the meaningless -pragunibhútápasavyakah pânah (for-pragunibhätâpasavyapůnih) in line 21, and the OMIBSion of some word like udtam before the words vo=B6# in line 18. In lines 13, 14 and 16 the potential syát is used for astr or bhavatı 3

The inscription, after the words "ôm, adoration to the Omniscient,' opetus with verse in which the holy Mahaviradêva, " the youngest of the Iinas,' is deaired to bestow welfare It then 
(in verses 2-7) gives the following genealogy of the grantor 
In the Chalumana race tbere was first at Nadduls the king Lakshmana His son Wee Sôhiya, and his son Baliraja. After him came his paternal uncle Vigrahapala Buis son was Mahendra, his son Apabula, and his son Balapragada Elis brother was Jendraraja, and his son Prithivipala Hus brother was Jôjalla, and his younger brother Åsardja, whose son was Alhanadêva Nothmg of historical importance is said about any of these chiefs 
According to lines 33-38, the data of this grant was the minister, appointed to the secretary ship (órikurana), Lalahtaidbara, the son of Dharanigga, of the Pragvåta raon, and the grant Wag composed and written by Sridhard, the son of Vasala (Visala ), who was the son of Manó. ratha, of the family of the Nagana. The inscription ends with the words this is the own hand (18 agu-manual) of the Muháraja, the allostnous Albanadeva'

These also are two plates, each of wbioh measures about ot" broad by 6%" hugle The first plate is 2n8cribed on one side only, and the second on both sides. The writing on thom is in a state of perfect preservation Each plate contains a hole for a nog, I do not know whether the ring and any seal that may have been attached to at have been preserved. The characters are Nagari, and the language is Sanskrit The text contains eight versosk of chiefly genealogi cal matter, three of the ordinary imprecatory yerses, and one verse giving the ynter's name, the rest 18 in prose, which in one or two places is grammatically 10correct As regards orthography, the latter v 18 vsed for both b and , except in labdhajanme, 1 3, the dental abılant us used for the palatal in Mahésvaram, 1 22 , and the sign of avagraha is once employed, in sogajak, I 16 In lae 29 the gerund lagriod is used in the sense of commencing from, begmurag with' 
The inscription records a grant by the Rajaputra (or kang's gon) Kirtipala, a son of Ålbaqadêre of Naddala After the words ôm suasta, it invokes the blessing of the gods Brabman, Sridhara (Vishnu), and Samkara (Siva), 'who, always free from PASALOn, are famons in the world as Jinas' (or Jaina Arhats). It then (211 Ferses 2-8) gives the following 
genealogy 
In the town of $akambhari there was formerly, m the Chahamina Bnoaga, the king Vakpatırája. His son was Lakshmana, who was king at Naddula, and his son was sobhita From him sprang Balirkja, and after him there ruled his paternal unole Vigraham påla. Vigrahapala's son was Mahendra, his son Apabills, and his son Jendraraja, from whom sprang Åsaraje" His son was Ålbana, the lord of Naddala, who defeated the Saurashtrikas. This king marned Annalladevi, a daughter of Anahula of the Rashtrauda race, who bore to him three song - Kelhana, Gajasimha, and Kirtipåle Of these, Kélhapa, the oldest son, was made kumara (or her-apparent) and given a share in the government 
According to l. 17 ff. the Rajakula? Ålnanadeva and the Kumara Kélhansdêya were pleased to give to the Rajaputra Kirtapala twelve villages appertaining to Naddalki And then, on Monday, the 5th of the dark half of Sravana of the year 1218, the Rajaputra Kirtipala, after bathing etc at Naddule and worshipping the Sun and Maheśvara (siva), granted a yearly sum of two franmas from each of the twelve yıllages of Naddajâi to (the temple of) the Jina Mab&vira at the village of Naddalai, and ordered this money to be paid in the month of Bhadrapada of every year, commencing with the year than current The twelve villages to which this order referred were Naddaldigråma, Sûjêrs, Dariji, Kavilada, Sönanam, Môrakari, Haravandam, Mağada, Kåraguvam, Dévasuri, Nadida, and Mauvadi, 
So far as I can judge, the village of Nadddiki mentioned in the above la different from (the mahasthana) Naddala and the words Naddildi-pratebaddha in Lune 18 appear clearly to show that Naddulai not merely yas the name of a village, but also denoted the distret to which the twelve yıllages given to Kirtipala belonged - On the map of the Rajpatina Ageooy I find, 
The second side of the second plate contains thres lues of writing Of these mo rubbing, but only Mr Oina's transcript has been sent to me 
The patre of verse is a mixture of Upendratazá And Vasantatilake. * So the name 18 apelt here and below in 
4 In C the name Asarda, while in A, the sctual spelling to Asdrdja. Here we have farága, and in D the actual spelling 18 Asardya. 
The occurrence of this name here induced me to state that the name in the Delhi Siw&lik pullar inforption of Vleuladdra Vugrabatás, á, line 2 (Ind Ant Vol XIX p 218) i Annalladeca, not Aullladdva, and that therefore Annalladede should be substituted for Avelladéve also in my Northern Lost, No 144, and above, Yal VIII App I P 14, col 1 (after Arşðraja)

Fiona this it will be seen that the given date is correct only for the amanta month Srêvada of the current Chartråd. Vikranza year 1218, and therefore apparently corresponds to Morday, the 25th July AD 1160 Ad current Vikrama years are quoted very rarely, thus result is not perhaps quute free from suspiciou, but I can see no valid reason to question the authentiouty of the wording of the original date,

C SUNDEÅ HILL INSCRIPTION OF CHÂCHIGADEVA; 
[VIKRAMA-SAMVAT 1819. This inscription is on two stones which were found on the Sundhå Hill, about 10 miles north of Jaspeptapura in the Jaswantapura district of the Jodhpur State of Ripotina $ I edit at from rubbings, kindly placed at my disposal by Mr Gannshankar Hirachand Ojha 
The first stone contalus 26 lines of writing which covers a space of 3' 3" broad by 1'71" bigh, the second 24 lines which cover a space of 2' 10" broad by 1'5" high. The size of the letters 18 about 1" on the filst stone, and between i and it" on the second The mecription was carefully written by Nimyagimba, a son of the physician Vijayapala, and well engraved by Juaran, a 800 of the sitradhdra Jisapala, and is in a state of perfect preservation. The characters are Nâgari, and the language 18 Sanskrit Excepting two proga passages at the bottom of other stone wluch record the names of the author, the writer and the engraver, the date samvat 1819 10 line 48, and another piose passage, numbered ag & verbe, in lines 35 and 36, the text ia in verse, the total number of parses (including the prose passage Counted as & verse) being 59 Ås regards orthography, the sign for v denotes both v and ), the palatal sibilant is used for the dental in úasya, 1 16, śrayamui, 1 19, samaramsas- (for salcerámś z-), 1 22, Galila., 1 29, fatah, 1 25, and Srtämśr- (for sztán 26-), 1 37, kh and shazo confounded in mayúsha- (for maykdkha-), 1 10, and piyükha- (for piyusha-), 1 41, the # of Sri is left unchanged before the initial vowel of . proper name in sri-Asärágan, 1 21, &ri-Udayasimha-, 1 35, and fri-4pardgribid-, 1 43, chohh is written for chh in chchhalera, 1 7, and chchhüyayd, 1 8, and the age of avagraha is employed in Samdiré srka, 1 16, and in four other places. The language is generally correct and plain, but there are one or two passages about the exact meatung of which I am still doubtful. I especially do not understand verso 12, which seems to allude to some legend unknown to me, in which the creator weighs the sun and the moon, apparently using the Gangea sa a balance. Moreover, I am not sure about the meamngs of the word srikart, which occuta in verses 19 and 59, and qupyadguru un verses 15, 26, and 27 To judge from the context in verse 19 ($rikart-raptakan védı-), the former pay denote some kaud of musical instrument, and as A guryadguru must be

something on which a golden kumbha and a golden kalasa can be placed, the word perhaps denotes a templo generally or a particular temple Of raze words or words employed in an andgual way we may note keli, ' the earth,' in Ferse 6, bhiisphóta, 'a mushroom,' in verge 16, the feminine yugali, a pair,' in verse 18, and támbaliya, 'An areok-nut,' ın yerse 21, bandhu and bindhava denote 'a brother' in verses 24, 26, and 40, and a con.gun is described as prérivyaja taya bûndhava, e '& brother in consequence of being born from & paternal uncle,' In verse 9. 
The wscription in the prose passage at the lottom of the first stone and in perse 59 is styled a gorašast: It was composed by the (Jaina) siri Jayamangala (Jayamangalachårpa), who belonged to the Brihad-gachchha and war & disciple of Ramachandia, himself a disciple of Dévacharya 3 And ats primary object is to glorify the Chihamâna chief Chàobigadêya, during those reign it was composed, and for whom it furnishes a date in the month of Vašákha of the [Vikrama) year 1910, falling in about AD 1262 Fortunately, the author has used the occasion to give a oulogistio account of the Chåhåmånes of Naddula generally, which is of considerable interest

town of Jilor in the same Stato A place named Kåsahrada has been identified by the late Prof Buhler2 with Kasandra or Kåsandhra, a village with about 400 inhabitants on the road from Dholkê to Palitânâ, in Long 72° 11', Lat 22° 19', but the Kâsahrada of this inscription may be , different place nearer Nadol - According to verso 41 Kırtıpåla's daughter Rüdaladėvi bualt two temples of Siya at Jåvibpuri 
(16) His son Samarasimha (yy 37 40) Be built extensive rampants on the Kadakschals (or gold hill') and founded the town of Samarapura ---This town I am unable to identify Kanakúchala according to Mr Ojha is the name of the forta of Jalor wluch, he informs me, is locally known as 'Sonalgarh, and the Sauvurna-gart of Já válıpors I find actually mentioned in an inscription on Mount Abû 3 In an inscription of the [Vikrama] year 1221, from which Mr Ojha has sent me a quotation, it is called Kiñchana-gadha -- Samurasimha clearly 18 the Chdhu mána*)-riina[ha*). Samarasiha, whose daughter Liladêyi was the (or a) queen of the Chaulukya Bhimadeva II 4 
(17) His son Udayasımha (Vy 42 46) According to the proge passage in linea 35 and 36 he ruled the glorioas Naddûla, the glorious Jâyâlıpura, Måndavyapura, Vägbbatameru, Sürachanda, Råtahrada, Khêda, Ramasainya, Srimala, Ratnapura, Satyapura, ud other places. With the exception of Mandaryapura and Ratahrada the places here ennmerated are easily found on the map of the Rajputâng Agency (13 Marwar) under the names Nádol, Jálor, Barmer, Sarichand, Kher (between Txlwira and Bulotra), Rámgen, Bhinmál, Ratanpura and Sánchor Mandavyapula is Mandor, according to the Rajputana Gazetteer three milea from Jôdhpur, Råtahrada I cannot identify -- Udayasımlla's queen was Prahladadadovi, who bore to him two sons, Châohigadeva and Châmundarâja Regarding his exploits, the inscriptaon states in a gene al way that he curved the price of the Turushka, was not to be conquered by the Gûrjara kings, and put an end to the Sundhu king He was a scholar conversand with the great works of Bharata; and others, and built two $18 temples at Jávålpura - Udayaanha clearly is identical with the ITahardjidhurdja Udayasımhadê ya of whose reign we have three Inscriptions at Bhinmal (Nos 697-699 of my Northern Lust) dated in the (Vikrama] years 1262, 1274 40.d 1305, corresponding to aboat A D 1205, A D 1218, and about AD 1248, and also with the Mahardjakula Udayasimhadeva, for whom I have given a date, falling in AD 1249, in Inu Ant Vol XIX 175, No 115 He was succeeded by 
(18) his sont Châchigadova (VV 47-57) He in verso 50 18 desonbed as "destroying the loaring Gurjara lord Virama, hatang the enemy Salya, taking exquisto delght in felling tiae shakung (or leaping) Pataka, depring of his colour Sanga, and a thunderbolt to the mountain the furous Nahara' As will be seen from this translation, the words šalya, pituka and sanga of the onginal must in my opinion, like virama and nahara, be taken as proper names, bat of the five persons enumerated I can identify only the first Being described as Gürjers lord." Virana appears clearly to be the Vöghålå Viramadeva, the son of Viradhavala and elder brother of Vibaladeva, who is reported to have been the 200-in-law of Udayasinha of Jåvalipura, and

I may add that Chichigadéra 2g mentioned, under the name Chicha, in fine 8 of the Jodhpur mscription of Rápidêvi, pablished by me above, Vol. IV. p 312 # In my text of that wscription I have given the same as Chuva, and a repered examination of the impressions enables ing to affirm that outhor thy is the actual reading, or that at any rate the name would be go read in the impressions by any one not acquainted with what we have learnt now from the Sundhs Hill inscription Knowing what I do now, I have no doubt that the intended reading us Ohache This Ohảoba is called a Chehrmina in Rûpêdêri's zagoription and described as the son of Udayasimhst and grandson of Samarasimha, which erectly fits our Chichigadér: The unsoziption supplies the additional information that Chacha's wife was Lakshmidovi, and that this lady bore to him Rupadêvi, who became the wife of a king Têjasimhs (to whom she bore a son named Kshôtrasimha) and founäed & well or taak in AD 1284, in the reign of the Hand rüyakula Samnyantacinhadova

On Mount Åbû there are at least two other inscriptions, of no great extent and partly illegible, of the reign of Lantigadêra, described as the Mahúrájakula, the glorious Lündhake or Landha(?) One is dated on Wednesday, the 8th of the dark balf of Chaitra u the (Vikrama] year 1372, corresponding, so far as I can see, to Wednesday, the 17th March A.D. 1316, the othor on some specified day, which I cannot make out with certainty, or the (Vikrana year 1373 And there 18 a third, partly effaced inscription, which also mentions the Maharaja kula, the glorious Lindhaka or Longhaka, and speaks of the glorions Nåmaladevi, who clearly is the Namalladéyi of the present insoription, the mother of Lantigadēva. I am not at presont prepared to give a fuller &coount of these three inscriptions. 
But I may add here that another account of some of the later Chabarainee is found in an inscriptions which is on a stone at a temple the Vimala-raschikt, ordinarily but wrongly called Vimala Sah's or Shah's temple which was founded on Mount Abů, according to the inscription itself in the Vikrama year 1088,7 by a certain Vimala, 'an ornament of the Praga våta race,' after he had been appointed dundapate at Arbuda by the (Chadlukya) king Bhima dêra (I.). This inscription in lines 9-15 (verses 14-22) gives the following razdvali': 
There was a hero, Åsarajae by name, # moon to the lotus-flower the Cbahuvima? family, who was king of the town of Nadulal(F. 14). Then there came samarasimba ; sad his son was Mahanasimhabbata (v. 15). Then came Fratåpamalla ; and of him was bom Vijada, who ruled the Marusthali-mandala (v. 16) He had three sons, the first of whom was the king Luniga (v 17) After him the text mentions Lundha (v 18) and Lumbha (v. 19), without distinctly saying that they were his younger brothers It then records the conquest of Arbuda (v 20), says further that Lümga's son was Têjasimha (v. 21), and after hin enlogizes M unaka, to whom it wishes long life (v. 22) 
The mutilated perse 23 appears to say that the glorions Lumbhaka, together with Têjasimha and Pihuña, in night manner oarned on the government of the morntain Arbnda ;

Agregazis the genealogy given in this inscriptaon, at 18 curious, but of no historical impoz tance, that it commences with Åparajal (Åberája, Å skrája), who was neither the founder of the famaly nor the father of Samarasimha who is here mentioned immediately after hum Instead of the namo Månayosimha of Irantigadéra's inscription this account hes Mahanasinha vicha must be rogarded as another name of the asmo person, and while sodorting to the former Viiada had four Bons, according to this genealogy he had only thrpom.

The subjoined inscription 18 engraved on a slab built into the foor of the first circait in the Erichcha-Udaiyir temple, which is comparatively dark The record was fonod and copied with the help of a lamp Åt my request the Collector of Tinnevelly has removed the slab to the Government Central Museum at Madras The plate issped with this paper is based on fresh impressions prepared by my Assistant Mr K. V Sabrahmanya Aiyar, BA, after the removal of the stone to Madras l_The alphaket of the document 18 Vatteluttu and the language Tamil probe intermixed with a few Sanskrit words in the Grantha alphabet The preservation is good, though a few syllables are matlated at the end of lines 3 to 13 and 81 The slab was roled before the writing, whicb 15 crowded into three sides of it, was engraved The number of Sanskrit words written in Grantha 18 comparatively few, vis svastu (1 1), sri (11 and 3), arugraha (1 1), bhatára (11 ls 3 and 10), maharaja (1 5), maharaja (1112 and 81) and

The following pecaliarities of the alphabet deserve to be noted The horizontal stroke of kl is very often small and indistinct But the letter has not yet assamed the planting form found in the Tirunell% and Cochin plates of Bhaskara-Ravivarnan The variaut of the letter ya noticed by Prof Hultzsch u the Kôttayan plates of Sthånu-Ravi and in certain Chôla 108orip trons does not occur here Iwo slightly different forms of t are used, of which one the first t of seluttu in ll 5 and 14) desembles, to a certain extent, the form in an ancient Vatteluttu record from Tirunddarkuara in the South Arcot district The powel az occurs thrice in the inscription (11 9, 22 and 75) As in other Tam) Inscriptions, hardly any distinction is made between the short x and the long when they ocour in combination with consonants Double ke 18 OCCA8100 ally written as a group, eg in maharajarklou and ningúvadukku in line 12, poludarkku in line 15, kummiyattukkuk in lino 16, Lakku and "Ikaruudlar in line 18 The 2-symbol B added in some cases over the top of the consonant to wluch it belongs, instead of by the side as 10 later Vattelutta epigraphs, see eg vi of vitrirundu (1 6), l. of polt (1 9), 1 of kuda (1 11), me of Crame.du (1 14), and l of ni-ndle (1 16) The Ayllable po is written as in the Madras Museum plates of Jatılayarmans without the addition of the d-bymbol (on the right) found 18 the Chola Vattelattu inscriptions? published by Prof Hultzscb The Tiranella plates distinguish by a similar addition the long på from the short po, End only a single instance of the formel occurs in the Cochin Jewe' grant? Thus the distinction between po and pô appears to be a later innovation, and evilently belongs to & period subsequent to the Jatilavarman plates and to the subjoined inscription If this conclusion be correct, the Cochiu and the Trinelli plates of Bhaskara-Ravıyarman must be later than Varaguņa-Pandya And as Prof Haltzsch 
employed in both of them agrees with that of the Chola inscrip tions from South Travancore published by him, o Bhaskara-Ravivarman may have to be assigned to the 10th or 11th century AD

The great Saya saint Manikkavasagar mentions the Påndya king Varaguna twice? un bis Tvruchcharramualalelcôvaryar The time of Sundaramûrti-Niyanår, who probably fioulished in the 8th century AD, is the upper limit of the date of Minikkaváśagar, who is consplenons by his omission from tho Tasuttordattogai, ze the list of Saiya saints composed by the for mer The lower limit may be taken as the reign of the Chola king Parakesalıraman Rajendradiva (AD 1052 to 1063), because in an 100liption of the 5th year of his reign (=AD 1056-57) reference is made to the poem [Meru]vembával composed by Manikkavišagar It may, therefore, be concluded that this Saiya saint was a contemporary of the Pin there was only oue king of that name, the Saiva saint must bave flourished in the second balf of the 9th century AD 
It is worthy of note that the caloulation of the annual requirements of the teranle proyided for in the gakjoined uncription implies that the measure of paddy known as Lalan consisted of 90 núlt, instead of 12 kugunu or 96 múlr, which we find, for instance, in the Tanjore insciiptaons, and which is the prevailing equivalent in the Tamil country A halam was equal to 15 Acuerunt, and a kurul equal to 6 ndlr The rate of interest, according to the snbjoined osen antzon 18 2 kalam of paddy for each labu, while in the Tanjoie 186cptions et us 3 hutten? for one kász Thus the rate in the Påndy& country at the time of Varaguna would be nearly eight times higher than that prevailing in Tayjore during the reign of the Chôla kung Rajaraja I (AD 985 to at least 1013), in case there was no difference in the value of the Kari The variations at the samo two places and periods in the price of some of the important articles of daily consumption are recorded in the foot-notes It is interesting to note that common salt and firewood, wbioh are included among the daily requirements in the Tanjore inscriptions, are conspicuous by their omission in the subjoined document. This is a significant fact, though we may not be warranted in cozoluding from it that these two arlicles had not to be paid for in the Pandya country during the reign of Varagian

The language of the inscription is Sanskrit It contazis the same twelve verses as the Nadagåm plates of Saka-Samyat 979 The remainder of the inscription 18 in prose. The first 41 lines are almost identical with the corresponding portion of the Nadagam plates They are, bowever, more carefully engraved and give several passages in a more correct form 
The inscription is one of king Vajrabasta (III ), the son of Kâmârnava (II) of the Ganga Iineage, and of Vinayamahadhvi of the Vaidumbs family Hus gedealogy is given in the same words as in the Nadagim plates, from Gunamahârnava downwarde, including the date of Vajrahasta's coronation The llikoription then goes on to state (I 40 f.) that the devout Wolshipper of Mahêávara (Siva), the ParamabhattárakMalarájádhırdja, the lord of the three Kalingas, the glorious Anantavarman Vajrahastadêva, being in good health, gue8 the following order from Kalınganagara, baying called together all the subjects, headed by the minister's Be it known to you (that), for the increase of the religious merit and fame of (Our) mother, father, and Ourself, the village named Tamaracheru in Varahavartani, combined with the Ohikhali hamlet (vafaka), Cucumscribed by the four boundaries, including water and land, free from all molestation, to last as long as the moon, the sun, and the earth, has been granted by Us, with libations of water, as an Agrahara, to five hundred learned Bråhmones who delight in the S1. acta of Sacrificing, conducting sacrifices, stadying, teaching, giving and accepting, 
ll versed in sacred lore, in the Saka year of the dice (4), the Vasus (8) and the treasures (9), on the occasion of an eclipse of the sun Therefore (Our gift) should be preserved by future kings in compliance with the law proclaimed by Mana Moreover, land with the produce of two bundred Murakas of grain has been given, to last as long as the moon and the sun, free from hindrances, to the god Kôtiśvarat for the maintenance of the nates of) Balt, Oharu, Nawedya, Dipapůjá, and so on And the repairs of what is broken and torn in this temple) should withoat faul be effected by the Brålmapas living there" 
The insoription does not add anything to our knowledge of the history of king Vajrahasta III We only learn that he also bad the name Anantavarman, liko his grandson Chôdagang deva 
Of the localities mentioned in the inscription, Kalinganagara has been identified by Mi Ranamurts with the villages Makhalingam and Nagarakatakam in the Ganjam district Varahavartani acous 11 several Gånga grants * The village of Tamaracheru is also known from Gånga inscmptions Its boundaries are given in the Clugacole platos of the Maharaja Dévêndravarman, in which the village Tamarachhera is granted to three hundred Brahmaries on the occasion of an eclipse of the sun The Chicacole plates of the Ganga Mahardja Indrayarman, 189ued from Kalinganagara iu Gaugėya-Samrat 128,8 farther state that the village of Tamaracheraya was granted to certain Brahmanas on the occasion of an eclipse of the moon on the full-moon day of Margaštra The latter inscription mentious Témaracheruva-grúnar bá(vď) fald (ka)-sahta[m](1 8f) This vátala 19 perhaps identical with the Chikhali-vitaka of our insoription.

The date of the grant is found in a part of the wscription which has not been so well pre served as the rest The first word 19 scarcely legible in the ink-imprension After & careful exam mination of the original, howover, Mr. Venksyys and myself find that the reading krsta is certain.

BY PROFESSOR F KILLHULN, CIE, GOTTINGEN Tho inscription edited above by Prof Haltzsch is dated in the oth year of the reign of the IT Chalukya Vikrumidityn I, at the time of a solar eclipse in the month śrayana From page 2 of Appendix II to Vol VIII of this Journal it will be seen that the date must necessarily fall betncen i D 6135 and 685, and from what we know to be the general iule i garding eclipses that are quoted in dates, we may conclude that the colipse here referred to post prubably voe one tliat wus visible at Bâdami, the capital of the W Chalukyas, situated in about Long 76o and Lat 16° 
Now it so buppens that during the fifty years from A D 635 to 485 there was, in both the pirnuinanta and the annu mout TADE, our a lugle solar eclipse that could have been tt all visible at Bådîmı, ora the eclipse s hrob took plece 3 5 m after meaa A1122352 of Monday, the 13th July AD880 That eclipso, auunlar one, was fully visible at Badimi, and the 13th July AD 660 was the 15th of the dark haif of the pirn imúnta Srávans We may compare e-pecially the solar eclipse in the dute of the Pattadakal duplicate pillar jaboliption of the reign of the \V. Chalukya Kirtivarian II (No 48 of my Southern Insi), of the 25th June AD 75k, which likewise took place in the půrnzınánta Szûvaon, and to show that in early times the prinunziata schemo of the months was p ovalent in Southero Indut, we may also cite the solar eclipse in the date of No 9 of the List, which took place in the purnimantu Bhadra pada, and the solai eclipse in the date of No 551 of the Lust, which took place in the purnumuntu Phålguna 
Monday, the 13th July A.D 680 (10 Saka-bacivat 582) would thus be in epory way a suitable equivalent of our date, that it ia its true equivalent 18 rendered more than probable by the date of the Nerûr plates of the quoán Vijayabhattárká (No 23 of my Southern Inst) That date corresponds to the 28rd September A.D 850, and is of the 5th year of a reign of which hitherto it appeared donbtful whether it was the leigu of Vikramaditya's oldest brother Chandråditya or of Vikramaditya burself Since we now have a date in AD 660 which would he a most proper equivalent for a date of the 6th year of the reign of Vikramaditya I, the date in AD 659 must surely be definitely assigned to the 5th year of the sume reign, and the two dates in my opinion must be taken to prove that Vikramaditya 1 commenced to reign between some time in September AD 854 and July AD 655,2

NO 18.-MANDHATA PLATES OF DEVAPALA. AND JAYAVARMAN II, 
OF MALAYA. BY PROFESSOR F KIEL#ORN, OIE ; GOTTINGEN. Of the Paramars kings, who raled over Malaya for more than three hundred years, there 
been published hitherto the texts of twelve copper-plate and three stone inscriptions, have besides short notices of about half a dozen other stone inscriptiona, generally of small stor importance. Of the copper-plate inscriptions, three were first edited by Colebrooke 10 
two by I Wilkinson in 1836 and 1838, one by Rajendralal Mitra in 1850, and three by dward Hall in 1860 and 1861 Of the stone inscriptions, the largest was first edited by Gangadhar Shastri in 1843, and another by FiúzEdward Hall an 1859 And from those nes principes the genealogy of the Paramâras of Málava, with moat of their dates, might 
been drawn up, about fifty years ago, very nearly as I have given at above, VOL. VIII.

dayaditya's family' I mention this to show how little that 38 really now we have learnt *Målaya, from its own records, for half a century, and to indicate what chances are open to officials of the Archeological Survey of India to enrich our knowledge of the histłry of that 
try Tor, in my opinion, a systematic search for inscriptions in the ancient Malava conntry be sure to bring to light numerous documents of importance. Even now such a search has 
Well waugurated 11 1908 there were discovered at Dhar the ingerptrona pablished above, Vol VIII. P 96 ff. 
p. 241 #, highly interesting from a literary point of view And in 1904 and 1905 were sā, at or near Mandháta, the two copper-plate inscriptions now here edited. Tbese plates of some value inasmuch as they show how Déyapala, one of the later kings of Malaya who already known to us, was related to preceding rulers, and as they give 28 the names of two 
of his, Jatugiddya and Jayavarman (IL.), wbo, one after the other, succeeded hito

When I published the Hulsandi usorption of Dérapâle, I had to point out that by pertain eintlots ni that juscription Dévapila was clearly connected with the Mahakumaras Lakslimivarinadeva, uis son Huischandıadêra, and his son Udayavalinadóva of Dhârâ Verse 21 of our inscription now informs as that Dövapala actually was a son of Harisohandra (and therefore a biother of the J[11lantira Udayavarman, whose plates are deted in A D 1200). In tho Leul saudâ 178cription, whicb 18 dated 11 AD 1218, only three years after the date of the latest known giant of Arjuna vi man, Dövapila, unlike bis brother and hu father and grand fathai, 15 styled Lahiritala1@14 Thia, together with the fact that he sacceeded Arjudayar man, would wdicate that in him the two branchea of the Palsmira family which till then had separately held away over alalava beoime rounted, or that one of them ceased to exist + Besides the klausaudi stone and the present plates, the date of which will be considered below, we kuow of two ucriptions of Dévapala's loign, dated in about 4.D 1229 and probably 12325

I may state here at once that, so far as the wool-day is conoerned, the date is incorrect The full-moon trthr of Bhadrapada ended 
in the carrent Chartråd. Vikrama year 1282 10h 50 m. after mean sunrise of Friday, 
the 30th August A D 1224, in the expired Ohaitrádi Vikrama yest 1282 on Tuesday, the 19th Augnst A D 1225 , 
and in the expired Karttıkáil. Vikrama year 1282 on Monday, the 7th September A.D. 
1226. None of the poogble equivalents of the date therefore was a Thursday. On the other hand, there was an eclipse of the moon-n & partial onem. from 17 h 45 m. to 20 h 13 m after meani sunrise, and therefore 728ible in India, on the second of the three posable daye, and I have no doubt that that day, Tuesday, the løth August A D. 1285, is really the day on which the grant pras made, and that in line 79 Thursday' has been erroneously put down instead of Tuesday' 
Of the localities mentioned above, Mâhishmati, from whore the grant was made, 18 Maheswar, a town in the Indoro Stato, Central India Agezoy, situated in Long 75° 37' and Lat 22° 11', on the northern bank of the Narmadá (Constablo's Hand Atlas of India, Plate 27, B d).

Below, in line 23 of the imaoription B., we have Mahuada-pathaké, clearly equivalent to Mahuada-pratsjägaranake Among other Paramâra grants, the word for "dzakmot' 18 pathaka albo in No. 57 of my Northern Ligst, and pratyjágaranaka in Nos 172, 189, 195 and 198 The latter term long ago has been identfied with the modern pargand, ' a district or traot of country mcluding a number of villages 
An abstract liat of the donees will be given below, p. 115 f. From that list it will be den that their number was 32, and that the proceeds of the village granted to them were divided into 321 shares (vantaxa), is such a manner that 26 doneas received one shaxs each, 3 half & share cach, 2 ope share and a half each, and I tihe mahdrája-pandita or'lang's Pangrt' Gdada) two shards.

Of the places with which the donees are connected, I take Mahayana-sthånd to be Mahában. El town in the Muttia district of the United Provinces (Constable's Hand Atlae Plate 27, Ob), Tripuri-sthana 18 Tewar, a village in the Jabalpur district of the Central Proya incas, about six miles west of Jabalpur, Ak618-athåna piobably 18 Akola in Berar (bd Plate 31, D a), and Mathure-sthana is Muttra in the United Provinces (162d Plate 27, Cb Diadvánaka-sthåna apparently is the Dendyadaka, mentioned above, Vol T P. 210, now the town of Didwânal in Jodhpur, Rajputâna (abad Plate 27, B b). Regarding tho romaining places I cannot offer any definite suggestions Mutåvathu-sthang is the same place which is mentioned as Muktavasth -sthông ra the three grants of Arjanavarmap, and lastinêpurg may be the village of Hathinavara (on the northern bank of the Narmada in tbe Pagårá pratvidgaranaka), which was granted by Arjunavarman's grant pablished in Journ Am Or Boc. Vol VII D 27 With Takarl-athens compare Takari,' sbove, Vol III p 550, and note 13. The names Aśrana-stbåna and Sarasvati-sthápa I have not found elsewhere. On the other hand, Madhyadoša is too well known to call for any remark here 
After the date in line 79, the text of our inscription has the three aksharas du trä mu, followed by the numeral 8 and a peculiar mark the exact shape of which may be seen from the photo lathograph The first akshara of course stands for dútakah or datah, and should be followed by a name to waich the word sri would have been piefired, but I do not know whether any or what name may be intended to be denoted by mu 3 and the followig symbol We and the sazne mu 3 (probably followed by the same mark which we have here) also in the two grants of Arjunavarman in Journ An Or Soc Vo] VIT pp 29 and 33 
The inscription then has the statement that this was composed by the king's preceptor (raja guru) Madana, with the appiobation of the mahdaandhavzgrahulcz (or great minister of peace and wai), the learned Bulbana ma sta tement which occurs also in Arjanavarman's grant in Journ An Or Sno Vol VII p 33, and (with mahäpandita instead of mahdsandhavgrahaka pandaia) in the sarae king's giant in Journ 43 Sac Beng Vol Y p $79, On Madana, who may 10asonably be taken to bave composed merely the introductory verses of the inscription, see not above, Vol VIII p 99 As regards Bilhada, in verse 17 of the prataet at the end of Åsadbara's Dharmůmritas • the learned Bilhass, the lord of poets,' is described as the mahasándhuvigrahtha of the glorious king Vindhya (Pandhya-bhapats)' Since this king Vindhva can be no other than Arjupavarman's grandfather Vindhyavarman, it might seem as af his mahtisándharigraheita Bilhana could not be the Bilhana of Arjunavarnan's grant and of the present inscription But in my opinion there ale pot for the present any valid reasons why the

The Song D&vepala and the guardus of the gods (dfrapela, 1 a the god Indra) are slike because either of tham s danauan wurumbhutash paditrakarapadmah About the exact meanings of the Atst of these two worde Here can be no doubt, it means both the pouring forth of the water of donationa' (china-tare), and the explots 
of the enemy of the Dinavas' (Danaoa art, ! # the god Viahnu Krishna) I am not so sure a boat the two mean We of the second word Referred to the king, it means 'holding patitra (18 kula or darbha grass, which 19 taken av by the person who is about to make a donation) in his lotus band" Applied to Indrs, I take it to teen that Ynáre, pleased with the exploits of the conqueror of the Danefas, took up the paoutra (o the arghe vessel) to make a respectful offering to Vishna In support of this explanation I would quote Pop Ind Vol L 124, 
. whora Brahman offers to Vishnu the argka-salıla, when he see how the latter has cheated Bali. Bat I am myself not quite Batzated wth this explanation, because I suspect the word padma to have beon used in two differ ent senses in the compound - From Inscriptions we may compare with our verse especially the verse in Ind dut To XVIII , 218,11 19 and 20 Sriyan babydra vidhuvad.ddnapárdértóshitah Manbharavad-duyafrashtza 
arpagtat sangam-agatan 1, where dancoaratito&itan meuna both 'excessively pleased by the water of dona trong and pleased by the enemy of the Dånavex Danaodre also has a third meaning, the ratting jace of eleolenta (nada-gala), and in that sense as well as in the sense of the enemy of the D&navas' the word is need in the Natskatālyacharita, XIIL VY 8 and 28, the Bret of which, 10 90 far as 10 Is apploable to Indre, neems to have suggeated the friyan babhara danandratstdrita) Mendndra[A] of the verse quoted above from an inscription (Incidentally I may mention that Panchanalya is not the title of a work,' buba name of the 28th sarch of the Naushadhiyaoharta). In Bkavall, p 200, the hand of a king w.compared with the ocean, beoszme bath hold the dancedrs.

These are two platos wiuch were found by Mr Lele, some time in 1904, at the village of Godai pula opposite the land of Mândbåtå, on the southern bank of the Narmadå in the Nimgr district of the Central Provinces They were sent by the Deputy Commissioner of Nimår to the Provincial Museum at Nagpur, where they are now deposited They measure about l' 53" broad by 101" high, and are beld together by two rings, now out, for which there are two holes in either plate I edit the inscription which they contain from impressions sent to me by the Goverumeat Epigraphist 
The first plate 18 inscribed on one side, and the second on both sides The writing both on the first plate and on the first side of the second plate covers a space about 1'4" broad by between 9" and 10' high, that on the second side of the second plate l' 4" broad by 8" high The three sides together contrın 53 lmes of well engraved writing whioh throughout is in a perfect state of proservation on the proper nght of the second side of the second plata, between lines 42 and 50, a vertical line marks off a space 34 broad by 4" hugh, which contains an engravmg of Ganda, with, below it, the words sva-hastówyan mahardjasya ll, in smaller characters than those in the body of the inscription The bird is represented in human form, kneeling towards tbe left, but with the head turned towards the might, and with fou hands, the two inner ones of which are joined over the breast, while the two others are lifted up on either side, the one on the left holding a szake, the head of whuch looks like a burd's head The size of the letters is about The characters are Nagari, closely resembling those of the insoription A, and the language is Sanskrit The inscription 18 so carefully written that in respect of orthography only few remarks are necessary The sign for v denotes both b and v, the dental sibilant is used for the palatal only in sata, 1 25 , AB 18 often the caso elsewhere, dy, de and thu are employed instead of ddy, ddy and ddhu, Janárddang is written Jandrijana- in kne 34, and shadbhirr & shafbhar= ip Ime 37 The siga of avagraha is employed seven times , and, excepting in såmpratam, 1 16, w at the end of a verse or half-verso

The inscription records an order by the Paramára Mahárdyddhiraja Jayavarman [II] of Malaya, dated, as will be shown below, in AD 1260 and 1261 Of the 28 verses with which at opens, veraes 1-21 are idential (except foz two various readings) with the same yerges of the inscription A, and contain therefoie the saune hist of kinga from Bhöjadôve to Dêvapala The two new verses, 22 and 23, may be rendered thus - 
“When 3 that king, the glorious Dévapala, had joyfully reported to Indra's abode, his soul, & death-dealing god to eneinzos (whils) over pleasing the people by his good qualities, the wise king Jaitugidêve, the glorious M&lava chief, ruled this land, by his noble exploits a young Nåråyapa" 
s Now tlat he, after enjoying the delights of royalty, has gone to the habitation of the gods, his younger brother, kung Jayavarman, rules the land" 
Dévapala, therefore, was succeeded by his son Jartugidera, and ho by hug younger brother Jayavarman (II) - Jutagidâya vas kuown already from the prašasta in Åsadhara's Dharmemruta, referred to above, according to which the commentary on that work was com pleted during the rogn of the Pramtra Devaplla's son Jaitagddva, on date which correa sponds to Monday, the 19th October AD 1243 In my Northern Iret, No 223, I have assumed that Jatagidere la identical with a kuog who is mentioned in a Ráhatgadlı inscription of the 28th August A D 1256, noticed by me in Ird Ant Vol XX p 84, where I have given the king's nane as Jaya (samha]dela But with what we now know áom the present insoription, I am not sure whether Sir A Cunninghnn6 was not right in reading the same name is Jaya[varmma]déva, and would therefore stapend my judgment on the matter till We possess proper impressions of an tacciption at Udaypur in Gwalior, which seems to be of the reign of a king Jayasinghadhva and to be dated in the [Vikrama) yes 1311 (11 Jan

The text actually has «Now that Derepåla hag resorted to ladran, aboda, his sop Jantutgadera ruled the land" The verse undoubtedly was taken ofer unchanged from ap 10sorphop of Jatagıders himsalt.

EPIGRAPHIA INDICA, 
[Vol. IX. 
The inscription is an ealogy of the Nayaka Viaudáva, the munister of kang Bhánuders of Kaksira. It states that he constructed two temples of Mahadera, and another in honour of the local deity of the fields, besides a building with a gateway, and excavated two tanks. It 19 dated in the [Saka] year 1242 bearing the name Kaudra, on the 5th tithi of the dark fortnight of Jyaishtha, corresponding to (Tuesday), the 27th May AD. 1320 Unforturately the week-day is not mentioned, and hence the date does not admit of verfioation It is alro possible that it may have been Wednesday, the 28th May, as there was a repetition of the Hindt date pañckami in that fortnight and month The noord gives the genealogy of the muister for four generations, and that of his sovereign for seven generations It us stated that Vasudéva's ancestors wore elephant-catchera (). Though in the Kanker State wild elephants are not now found, they are still to be met with in the divis10n in which it 18 included * The most important part of the inscription is that which gives the genealogy of the Kakava chiefs, mentioning in order the following - Simhardi, Vyågbra, Vopadeva, Eplehra, Jaitarkja, 8ômachandra and Bhanudéve. The dynasty is stated to be lunar, and the want of any epithet indicating paramount sovereignty postulates & subordination to another power The epithets applied to tbeta matvanida (1.1), ripa au 2 and 3). dharanidhara (1. 6), bhapala ( 17) and arcoati (IL 10 and 13), are all synonyms of the word kan. In two copper-plato grants of Pamparajadays found in tbe Kankor States the king 18 styled Somqvamiánuaya prasúta-mahamandalika (fendstory chief of the lanar race), which supports the above state ment The present Raj family of Kanker is doubtless connected with these kings It belongs to the lanar race and has always claimed to be a very azoient family* According to its own traditions at claims to have come from Orke Its original ancestor was malig at Jagannaths pari, bat, on suddenly becoming a loper, in which state he could no longer occupy the throne, left the place and went out in search of a cure At Sıb&w&, close to Kanker and now in the Dhamtari tahkil of the Raipur dietrict, & spring was found, by bathing in which he got rid of the loathsome disease. The local people persuaded him to stay on at Sik&w and installed him king, and he and hus descendanta continued to rule there Thero oan be httle doubt that Sihiwa was once the capital of this dynasty, as its rums and temples testify There is still an 1080x1p tion there, which is dated in the Gaka year 1114 The capital was finally removed to Kanker This must have been done prior to Bhanudêva's times. For in line 12 we read Kákarri tripa-Bhanudéve nagaré (in KÅkaina, the town or capital of lang Bhånudéra), and in lines 3 to 5 KAkatrd , Sri-Jartarágô=bhanat (there was the illustrious Jaitarija in Kákara). This Jautardja Yas the grandfather of Bhånadera Thus Kåkalra has been the capital of the State for over 600 years Kanker once included the nch Dhamtari tahatl of the Rapur

» The Central Prosacea, called Goodwind by the Mualmând, were to Intested by thout animate that even revenus was lovred in sleppanta, Even places like Jabalpor, which were and are far les japply toan Kankets had their quota of wild elephants See Jarrett's Å14--Akbars, Vol 11 W 190, where the following accors - " Garha (2 miles from Jabalpur) 1# separate State abounding with foretu 10 wbiob are nowdroue wild elephant.

As regards the buildings and tanks mentioned in the inscription, there can be no doubt that the two tanks are identical with the present Diwan abd Sitala taldos, between which the ruins of the temples may still be seen It is very probable that the Sitalâ taliam & name which gained currency since a hut dedicated to the goddess Sitald was constructed on its bank-18 the Kaudika-bandhs of the inscription, the annamed tank being called Diwân talão or 
minister's tank, thus keeping up the memory of its original constructor, who by calling it & tadaga apparently distinguished it from the bandha, 1. the tank formed by merely damming up a stream The very name Kandıkta-bandha indicates its secondary importance In the first place it was merely a bundha (dana), and secondly it was probably constructed by the payment of kaudikas, Sanskritised form of kaudis (COWTIes) or shells, & currency of the lowest value 
The temples and buildings have all fallen or been pulled down, and from the materials a fresh teniple was constructed by the predecessor of the present chef The old temples were seen by Mr Fisher, who wag Deputy Commissioner of the Raipur district (to which Kanker was formerly attached) about 1873 AD, and he alludes to them in his private Journals thus --- " Saw some very curious old temples to the west of the village, one has a biak giving, as I was told, some porticulars of its history They are very old and utterly neglected now " This bijak was seen on the gate of the Mahadeva temple about the year 1825 as recorded in the Asalc Researches, Vol XV y 505, where its date is also stated, which is the same as that of our inscription in all details A noteworthy point in our inscription 18 the mention of the construction of a puratóbhadra with a pratóll, about which latter Dr Vogel has written an article in the Royal Asiatic Society's Journal, July 1906, p 539 He has proved that pratóli really meant a gate-way, evidently strongly built and of considerable height It was sometames provided with a flight of steps: I have not been able to find puratóbhadra in the Kośas to which I have acces, but sarvatóbhadra is described as a kind of house with 4 doors facing the 4 quarters * From this I afer that a puratóbhadra was a building with only one door in front And the Kakaira puratóbhadra was actually furnished with a gate-way (pratólu) 
wwwwwwwwwwwwww 1 In thua part of the country a good deal of transactious were done in cowries (Bheilst Sayukrit kapar. diká), which are still used as currency by the poor people It must not however bo sapposed that there were no coins bare In the copper-plates of Pampa azadêve alluded to before, the comu tanka of local mint Ands ! mention It 18 still & practice in some places to get work done, chefly digging and throwing of earth, by what 18 called kaudthat, a imode of piecowork pxyment, 2 or 4 COW1188 or more according to the labour involved being paid for each bagket of earth thrown out 4 man with cowries stands at a place where the earth 18 to be tbrown, and og ench labourer turns up and throws down the earth, he receives lunediately the fixed 19mber of cowries each time Tous mode of labour automatically puncebes the idlers and seves f good deal of supervision and account-kesping where a large number of labourers are engaged simultaneously on such , wok

4 The idea beems to have been takeu from & sarvatonkadra village, which is described in the Mahardra, # book of the bighost authority on Hindd architecture, as "# town or yıllage of quadrangular form, contajuing in the middle a temple dedicated to one of the triad, Brahma, Vishnu or Mahesvara It bas $ #treets of equal lengtii on the 4 siden at night auglea, and 2 more clossing arch other in the middle Between these may be formed 9, 4, 5, or as many 1001 streets as tbe extent of the village will admit, on each side, parallel to the middlemoat street Without the walls should be placed the shrines of the derties who preside over and defend the several quarters of the village, at the angular points should be erected halle, porticoes, colleges and other pablo edifices, and towards the quarter of Agra (south east) & watershed for the sucommodation of travellers Bud pastange The whole viuuge shonld be secured by a qnsdrangular wall and a ditch around it, with 4 large and as mauy small gates in the middle of the sides and at the engular poate Without the northern gate abguld be created a temple for the forehzp of Mahakali, and the buts of Chandklas or outcastes abould be a krofa distant from the village A tank or reservoir should be constructed exther on the south or north ade or near ather of those 3 points for ablutionary and culinary purposes"-See Ram Baz'ı arcArtoctor of the Hindur, 1834, 49

POSTSCRIPT, 
BY PROFESSOR F. KIELHORA, CIE, GOTTINEN Prof Hultzsch bas asked me to espress an opinion on the date of the stone inscription published above, of which he bas sent me an impression. He also, at the instance of Bir Ein Liel, kina requested me to give my readings of, and, if possible, to verify, the dates of tha copper-plata 1Decriptions of the Kakaira (Kaoker) chief Pamparåjadêva, which are about to be published by M. Hua Tual, and of which impressions have been forvarded by him 
The date of the stone inscription clearly is, as given by Mr Hug Lal Samvat 1242 Raudra carvatsaré | Jyêshta-vadi panchanyám! It does not admit of exact verfication, and the only question concerning at 19, to which era the year 1242 should be leferred so that the date may fall 10 a Raudra-samvatsara Apgagort the exprosszon sarvat 1242 would be taken here to denote the Vikrama year 1842; but there is no Vikrama year 1242 that could be called a Rsudrs senr Nearest to V 1242, Raudra, by the southern system, would be the expired Ohoisas Vikrame year 1257, and by the northern mean-siga system it would indicate the time from the 13th Novembei AD 1195 to the 8th November A.D. 1196, 13 the expired Chartrids 01 Karttıkådi Vikrama years 1252 and 1253 If the year of the date wore 125% 1051erd of 1942, it might be taken to be the expired Ketrttråd. Vikrama year 1252, in which case the 5th of the dark Lalf Jyash tha would undoubtedly fall in Raudra year, but there is nothing to prove that the writer en oneously put 1242 instead of 125% 
Assquing, then, the figures for the year and the Jupiter's year to have been correctly given, it would only remair to take the expression slot 1212, 8: Has been done by Mr Hira Lal, to decote the expired Saka year 1242, which by the southern system was a Raudra year But here we are at once inet by & dificulty. In my paper on the dates of the Saka ela in inscriptions I lave shown that among 400 Śaka dates of inscriptions only five do not contain the word Sala or Sal, and that of over these five dates three are sparious or suspicious, while the two others are in Terse Thuio 18 therefore every reason to 25kumu that the writur of the 2n8c7iption would bave denoted the Sake year 1242 by some such expression as Sale 1242, not by 50mlet 1242 And there might be the further objection that in the Central Provinces, where tõe date comes from, the system of Jupiter's years ordinarly followed seenis to bure been the northeru Bystom, not the coatbern system by which alone the Sakr year 1242 can be desoribed as l'endra year

As the date cannot be verified, it would be useless to indulge in further speculatious? To to the wording of it seems certainly to be suspicious And I can only say that, assuming ta 
tires for the year to be correct and the date to be 108.lly A Saka date, it would correspond e puneminta Jyaishtha, to Monday, the 28th April AD 1320, and for the amante JTR8 bu stated by Mr Hua Lal, to Tuesday, the 27th, or Wednesday, the 28th May, AD 1320 
Of tho two copper-plate insoriptions of Pamparaja, one is clearly dated as follows -- 
Isyala EL 8] samvatsarê Kårtıks-maisChitid-1 ikshé Ravi-dinė saryoparage 
L 101 . . . $ema vat 266 . De 10 the Isvara year, at an eclipse of the sun on a Sunday, in the nakshatra Chitra the month Kürttika, 
, . in the yeur 966" I have no doubt that the year 966 of this date must be referred to the Kalachuri era 
la Festgruss an Roth, p 53 ff, I have tried to prove from tho 12 dates between the years gund 958, which hitherto leve been available, that the Kalachur (Chedi) era commenced 
the 5th September AD 248, that the years were A$u4nádr years and the months pútne orta months, and that therefore, to convert an expired Kalachail yeur into an expired peau of e Kaliyuga, ve manet acid 3349 when the date falls in the bright half of Åbyiaa or in any uth from Kåritika to Philgana, and 3350 in all other cases Applyig than here, we find that 
date, for the pútmineinta Kärttika of the expirai Kalachun your 968 = Kaliyuga expired 66 +3349_4815, regularly corresponds to Sunday, the 5th October AD 1214, when the 15th 
Fur of the dark half ended 3 h 33 m, and when the nakshatra was Chitra, by the equal space vaten and according to Ganga for 2 h 38 m, after inean supilke On the same day there was a 
tal colapse of the sun, the greatest phase of which at Kanker (1n about Lovg 82End Lat 0°) u four digits 8 
It will, I think, be generally admitted that Sunday, the 5th October A.D 1214, un 3u1.btedly is the pioper eqaivalent of ou date, but, in connection with this date, the witei 
parently bas prongly quoted the year Isvara justead of the immediately following year abudhanya By the northern mean-sign system Iávala lasted from the 2nd September A D 212 to the 29th August A D 1213 By the northern luni-solar system therefore Tévaia was e proper name of Kaliyuga 4314 expired, aud not of the year of our date, ve Kaliyuga 4315 piled, which according to the northern lum-solar system, as already intimated, rould have ceived the name Baludbánya For the present, I can ascibe the error only to the waiter's relessness, but the trror 15 of such a natue that it confirnis rather than uvalidates our general sult

And trenting the year again as & Kalachuri year, I find the followig equivalenta. 
For the expired Kalaohur year 965 = Kaliyuga expired 965 + 33504315 Saturday, the 2nd August A D, 1214, when the 10th title of tie dark half of the girnininta Bhidiainda ended 18 h 25 m, and the nahslatra Tag Mriga, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 21 h 40m. And by the Brahma-siddhinta foi 20 h 21 m, after mean sunrise 
For the onrrent Kalacburi year 965= Kalıyoga 4315 current Monday, the 12th August AD. 1213, when the 10th tithr of the daik half of the purnamanta Bhadrapada commenced 75, and when the nakshatra was Mriga, by the equal space system and according to Garga for 15 h 46 m, and by the Brahma-madkanta for 14 h 27 m, aftor mean sunrise 
Of the two, I do not hesitate to accept Monday, the 12th August AD 1218, as the trus equivalent of our date That the orths of the date was a Ourront tatlı can cause no diffioulty And the fact that Kalachanı years, occasionally and exceptionally, are quoted as current years 18 proped by another date, IN AI, juscription of which Mr DR Bhandarkar some time ago has beau good enough to send me a photograph.

No. 17 THE INSCRIPTIONS ON THE MATHURA LION-CAPITAL. 
BY T W THOMAS, M A., LONDON The Matburå lion-capital was discovered by the lato Di Bhagyanlal IndI'ai under -au mstarcos detailed in bus artzole ou The Northern Kshatrapas edited and published by ofessor E J Rapson in the Journal of the Royal Asratio Society, N, S, Vol XXVI 1894, 
541-554 , sed in particular pp 542-4 It was found embedded in the steps of au altar voted to Sitalà on a site belongmg to some low-coste Hund is at Mathurid, but not norg finitely located. Harig been with difficulty seened by Dr Bhagyanlal, the capital was a yeyed to Bombay , subsequently, on his death, it was despatched to England, and it can now 
seen in the Buddhist Room at the British Museum 
The usazaptions incised on the capital were transcribed and translated by the discoverez ngelf, but owing to his death the task of publishing the MS was entrusted by the Council the Royal Asiatic Society to the late Professor Bubler, who was able to compare the read *8 with the stone itself and with paper impressions presented to him in 1889 by Dr James rgess. At the commencement of the published account, which appeared in the Journal of 
Royal Arlatrc Society, N 8, Vol XXVI 1894, pp 525-540, Prof Bühler observes that he collation las made necossbry some alterations in the transcript and in the translation, ong which the more important ones have been pointed out in the notos But I may confi atly asgert that all really essential points have been fully settled and explained by Dr. Agvanlal, whose great acumen and scholarship are as conspicuous in his interpretation of se inscriptions as in his other epigraphic publications For onremonce's sako I have pretired

While enda sıvg 10 the main these statements of so great in authority, from all posats of 320W, as the lato Prot Buhler I have endear on101), w ze-e.citrog the insculptious with Plates, which before were waiting, to give an unbiased lentlig based upon new impr(bolous supplied by the kudness of the Department in the Aluseum (ut the instance of Di J F Flect, who originated the suggestion of this article), and upon frequent unspectwns of the stone itself The mesent Versions will therefore be found to diffel ia 5013 particulars from those of Dr Bluagvanlal and Prof Buller 
The slinpo and dimensions of the capital sul be best realized from the accompanying Plates, but some particnlars demand a vez bal (lescription In the firsi place, the cuculaz hole in the upper gquale surface, cori esponding to esimta bole up the under surface prutes that the capital was sul mounted by a shaft or some other continuation. Prof Buhle, iluarks that various l'epresentations on slabs from the Anarayati Stopa prove the shaft to letu supprtul a Dharma okala, referring to the Archeological Survey Plates published by Di Burgess (Plaio IXXVII figs land 6, and Plata al figs 3 and 4) But it has alandy been pointed out by me iu the Journal of the Royal istałe Society for 1906, pp 216 and 464, that the use of lion-caprials of atual pill115 vas a common feature in Indian architecture, derived trom Persian models Examples acay be seen in the Archeological Survey publicatious relating to Dharkut (Cunninghann, Platus v1 , TUI, X), Sanchi (Maisey, Plates xix, XXIU ), Mathur (V A Switik, Plates xlin -x]yi and xbx-)), Amali Fati (Burgess p 93, Plates xlix Iw, liv, ls and Burgass, 1882, Plate xly), and elsewhere The presuinption, therefore, is that the lion-capital formed the crown of a real pillai 
Secondly, the state of the stone has been somewhat ımpanied by time and accident In some cases, e g 11 the loss of the horn-like projections of the two beads, this has insolved no curtail ment of the text The clippings et the two bottom corners have been, no doubt, equally harmless But the front, wich would be the most exposed portion of the stone, has in part su peeled away as to render some characters allegible In the second line of the large 10scliption cuved ou the body of the lion to the spectator's left (J I 1) the laige ra is followed by tices of two ou tluree ashuras of eqaal size leading to a jantly pisillo $), after which inteitene tice doubtful 
characters before re come to film ground again ia pula? 
12 sizə the ahsitugas vary considerably Ve may distmguish fire groaps (1) the inscriptions BE FIJ M ou tile front and back of the stone (among which I per baps exceedly the otbois slightly in size), hiring characters about 2-21 w in beiglit, (2) G N P E". on the back ini ander surface of the stone, cuck 2-14 in , (3) A (on the unpoil shed top and back of the stone), K I, (on the beast of the left lion), O QR (underneath), J' (front, on the leg of the left Izon), C11CS 11 in, (4) O D E' (winok may bo estimatod from E', slightly the largest, tibilule among the characters of D ), circa 1 in , (5) H H', slightly incisEcZ in small characteis, of about & in, at the places indicated on the front In the sane umscription tbe Laha) as generally maintain a fali avei,ige size, but sometimes they become a little cramped by Imitations of space It is cloar that the inscriptions in the langez cluwacteis (1), (2) and (3) were carved first, and those of a smaller size were aftez yards clanned in wberover space offered 
In type, on the other hand, the characters present au nufo maty which, like the suljest matter of the records, forbids any supposition of additions during the subsequent history of the brone They have been compared by Prof. Buhler to those of the Shikbizgarhi and Manselis Vergone of the acts of Asoka.

between the Asöka foins and the cursive derivatives of the Dlaanapada AIS and ncovered by Dr Stelzi, to wluch appiozimate the Faso soatchings from Napkila and vlaces and the inscription of Sue-Vabil (see the Plate given by Dr Hoeinle in the 
Antzinary, Vol & facing P 325) It does not, horrever, appear to be quite identical ut exlubited in any of these or in the Taxıla plate (see the faosimlo above, Vol IV 
p56), where on account of the bustorical contiguity we should expect to find, and do find, e congenol The inscriptions edited by M Senart in the Journal Asiatique, Sér IX Vol 17 (1899); P 526 ff and Vol IV (1894), p 504 f (No 35), ale also in sinnilav

further consideraton The form of ta, winch Occulis many times, has in other records the of tra (see the Plate) Although we have certainly one case (J 2, in Lurrta), and stwo others (D" in krakirita”, and R 1 in Tachiulasa or Rachhlasa ?), where the bottom * Fanting, the character occurs so often that these can be no doubt as to what it denotes 
posing it to be a da Buhler, who in his articles in the Z DM. G Vol XLIII pp 183 and Das read a sumilar character as tt (10 also Johansson, Der Dualeht der Shahbazgarhe [2012, I p 126), was infuenced by finding it in pratésó (AL 2) and smılar casos But the al forn of da 18 sereial times instanced, and the # for din prateći and elsewhere is a ctical, not an orthographical, feature, found in other Khuzoshthi records The only question romannug, us concerns ta, is part of a largor matte? How do we 
euresented the conjunct r ? In number of cases the addition is made by a stroke inolined 11 left attached to the lower cuive This Occius in A I chhattrao), A 6 (matrd), A, 7 Seno In these examples there was some slight danger of confusiou with tå, which shows 
*lle Plate) a gumuar stroke attached to the uppel culve Perhaps for this 10980. azother ice is more frequently adopted, namely a dot in place of the stroke, see B 1 and 3 (thhatra), 2 (putra), M 1 (chhatra"), Q, 2 (chhatra") There remain A 3 (where to is tyritten), A 5 here I can detect no clear indication of the g-stroke ou dot), G 1 (where there is nothing 
ched to the to, though the reading may be chhratava, if not chchhatava), G 2 (ahhatava), 3 (where we seem to have atrauréna for até) In A l we have two strokes, both of ich seem to be intentional, one of them, which resembles the downward stroke of the Aramaic . Pahlavi t, I have conjectured to denote a doubled t before the go Of a cerebral (la) I can 1 no trace, unless indeed it is contained in the mysterions third sign of A 13 
With other consonants than t the yo 18 regularly inserted where required We may quote a 20 A 7 (where it takes the form of a detached stroke), gra in A 2 and N 2, pa À 10 adhavipra'), A 11 (pratt"), M 8 (pratesó), N 3, dhra in A 10 and M 2, chhra (chchha 1) 
G 2 and I (chlratava and chhratrava) In the last example, as also in prædhravi . 10, padhruvi in I 2), it would seem to be even repeated, but this may be feature of 
Dunciation rather than of writing A really otiose pastroke 18 found in maheshru, A 2, and Sbably in Paspasra, A 7 
The case of krn la peculiar If ye disregard the doubtfal inscription E", it is found four les, in bhakravató (À 12), nakraruasa (F 1 and N 1), and sakrastúnasa (P 1), ?e in places 1870 we expect a simple ga This can hardly be accidental, it would seein probable that 12 350 cases the combination kra represents aspirantic pronunciation of ga, apalogous to the Telan , more especially as in the name of Seistía (Pablavi Sayhastári) this sound no doubt

A few furthor points remain to be noticed. (1) In ateurena and hôrakóparwurëna (49 and 10) we find a perhaps itentional stroke diverging from the tail of the ha, though not in both cases on the sane side Have we here na? The rather noticoable variations in the form of the nasal nay be observed in Plate 17 
(2) Sa valles between the forms with and without ine small adjunct near the centre (ses Plate 1f) In N 3 the addition of the r-stzoko male8 dum In H 4 a slight curte at the foot may also indicate sunt, anticipating as in the Stein docaments, the following pasal A writing sya is certamly to be seen in G.1 and probably also in B 2 
(3) The two occurrenoeg of kharaðsta (A. 4 and E 1) seem both to Bhop & small diverging mark is the place where h 18 usually appended, & circumstance whíob, together with the prok able dervation of the word, suggests & reading rhashra, 
(4) In A 2 a la a small stroke added as a sort of hesd 
(5) In A 13 we have the distinguishing mark of & vertical and at the top, elsewhere it 18 horizontal and at the centre 
(6) The sê of A 11 has two smal (head and foot) strokes differentiating it from the sê of the previous line, app&contly without reason 
(7) The comphosted jo of C. 2 recalls the vaneties on the coins (see Gardner, The Ours af Baca, pp. 55, 83) 
(8) Lastly we may mention that the stone presents a dumber of dots and other small marks wbich muet apparently be asombed to socdent or wear In some cases we might be tempted to trace the anusvára, eg 20 J, where we should thae arrive at A reading Sarudstvatamnam. 
The Präkfit in which the inscriptions are composed has been described by Buble and per haps need not be discussed at length It is distoguzhod by closeness to Sanskrt Elision of medial consonants oocars, if we negleot tbe sufixal k (nagaras, kurillac, máhásdnghia), only 2 ateurana (for Purina 7), saspa[t]& In ayarlo and puya (úcharya and půya) we have a weak ening of ch to y 1 bave suggested (Journal of the Royal Anato Society, 1906, p 205) that the sound denoted by thig y was that of the French ) and the matter will arise Agaia in connection with the propor names The changes apparent in the word ohhatrapa are not necesarily Indian The hardening of g and d to here and t has been already dealt with on the other hand pappears ia thúva and pratrfhairta as o, zovor b as p Conjnnot & in, exoept in foreign and technical names (kharaðsta, sakustána, sarudstuvädu), asmmilated ([t]ther, ladhavira, pati[l]thâu tta, bht[k]khu), t, on the other hand, remains both as prior (sarua, thardaa), and as posterior, member of a conjonction The forma of the a and a declennoza Sre pory well preserved. The nominative slog masc appara both as a (in thüva, etc) and as o (kuharadsto, etc.), the peutar 18 in o[m] (Garira[m]), the genitive singular in [8]sa, twice writtan sya. In numasa tihe declen non allows the Peakpit form, of the inflexion we have several forms (instrumental •rd, etc) Ther-stems seem to be regalar (dhte m A 3 being & miswriting for detri), while ja yuvarúño [A] in À 4 we have an altrar Sapskrit rise of the consonant paradigma We pay zote the employment of sarvostudda in place of "uddin. The only pronoun& occurring me imd, nominative mascaline, and &, & locative, and the only finito verb bhusani (cortainly not bbbatia 2 Bühler rend) presents a problem ; see the note to A 13. The false oonoord farina pratithat is found else where (see the note ad loc) 
We now come to the historical matter, whyoh bee been discussed both by Bihter, pp. 529-33, and by Professor Rapson (p 541 ff. of the same volume). The object of the obiet muscripton (4.) is to record a religious dong taon on the part of the Chief Queen of this Bethanap Hajula, with whom are associated various members of her family and her whate boart." In the other insoriptions we and honourable mention of (1) cartain other member the trap family at Mathard, (2) othor Satraps, and (3) & Bnddhist teacher, or to Buddhist topsheimta bearing the

names Buddhila (ar Budlula) and Ba[d]dbadeva The last paned, who is termed an óchórya and iepresented as a champion of the Sarvästi vadin school against the wyal Mahasanghikas, bears & Dane włuch cannot bave been rare , oue teacher of this name is mentioned by Titanitha as a leader of the Vuibhålbikas (see Schiefnor's translahon, pp 4 and 67, and the references in the St Petersburg Dietionary), and we have therefore no suficient means of ideatifioation It Is different with some of the other names 
In the first place, the Gicut Satrap Rajūla himself and his son, the Satrup Sudása, have both been identified with rulers named on coins and in other inscriptions from Mathard (Hee Buhler, pp 531-2, Ep Ind Vol 1 pp 195-6, 199, Cunningham, Archeological Survey Reports, Vol III P 30, and Vol XX PP 48-9, V A. Smith, Jathuri, p 21, Rapsoni, Ind2:19 Ooms, p 9. $ 33) These identifications were made by Cunningbain, who also proposed to identify the Yuvarija Kharaðsta with the Kharemosta, son of artas, known from coins, a suggestion wlich is scarcely tonuble (Buhler, op ott p 532) The further identification of the Great Satrap Kusulau Pidika with Påtika, son of the Satrap Liaka Kusůlaka, named in the Taxila plate, is important not only as supplying a date, though in an unknown era-for the Taxıla Plate is dated in the year 78, (in the tune) of the Great King Môga, but also as imply bg that the other Satraps mentioned may also have ruled in distant place fore that the inscriptions make a point of Qaming with respect the chief representatives of the Kshatrapa dominion in Northern India, and this is a strong argument for retaiuing the evident interpretation of insution P 88 in honour of the whole Sake realm (Sakastana) It is therefore important to ascertain what other indications of nationality the inecriptrong supply 
In an article pnblished in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Somety for 1906 (pp 181-216, 
have endeavoured to prove (1) that Sakas inhabited the region now known as Sestan as early as the time of Darius the Great and Alexander, (2) that the inscriptions of the lion-capital exhibit a mixture of Persian and Saka nomenclature, and I have inferred that the Kshatrapas of Northai.n India were the representatives of a mixed Parthian and Salsa domination I think that all tbege propositions must be adhered to Upon the first of them we need not dwell here The second 18 strongly supported a priori by the fuot that Pâtika of maxil bo bears himself a distinctively Persian name, mentions as he overlord the Great Kmg Möge, whose name 18 with equal distinctiveness Saka 
I may here refer to a small point in the Tuxıla inscription which is not without interest The form of the phase chhatrapasa Inala Kusülako puma tara (for chhatrapasa Irakasa Rusalakasa), which iarra 1a second phrase, has been by Buhler compared with passages 10 two of the Jama 12scriptions from Mathurâ We may perhaps find something of the kind in Tater Sanskrit Dscriptions and in the style of the Panchatantra and Hstopadasa But the turn of the phrase za so conspicuous a feature of the edicta of the Achemends that we are strongly tempted to regaid it as, like the earliest Indian architectare, derived through the Satraps from a Peranan model 
This is not the place for resamig at length the discussion of the etymology of all the names occurring m the inscriptiona A few poiata may be mentioned 
1 The name Kharaðsta 01 Kharha(hralôsta, 43 Khushathra, 'sovereignty,' to osla, 'blessing," is practically certain The initial kha, which reappears in Ichaharata with veriant kahahardta, presents no difficulty, it reaprs in the kharapalluna (no doubt khshathrupıhland, defence of sovereignty,') of the new Sirnáth Inscription (above, Vol VII p 173 ff) The variation in the inhal consonant gloop, of which wo and a third form in chhatrapa, 18 of the same nature ab that in cavaler and chivalry, that is to my, it 18 due to historical and dialectical differences 1 
102 C01 gired by Prof Rapson, Indra* Cosns, Pl 1 No 1, we have shahardta in BrAbui together with Cakaharata 10 Kbarðshthi, 80100 of the NÅsk inscriptions have Khakhardta, cto

The pra, from thra, az ose (with other forms) on Iranian sou, Mihra (Skt Mahara) being a variant of Mithra, of which a still more simplified form is found in Liraboyana of the Taklit 1-B.IN inscription (100 M Bofer's article in the Journal Asiatique, Sér X Vol IIL (1904) pp 463 4), the old Persian dialect had also 8, concerning which it may be sufficient to refer to the grampar

4 Nauludo la no doubt for Naurüdd, New Growth,' with & Pahlavi or Afghan l for : 5 The element Khala- appears in Khalama and Khalsamuso 6 The termudation -s in Komisu and 'santiso seems to be Scythia. 
7 The eloznent -81 in Aydas Komisit, Nandasikasa, Paspası 18 certainly not the Sangkut ni, which wanid have been so written zu these inscriptions It 18 a derivative element, porlas identical with tho-ci, -zi (Pahlavi -cili) which appears in many Iranian names 
8 The y in Ayasi, Hayzurana, Ayamud, found also on the couns as an alternative for = IN Ayrl280, elo (sea Gardner, op cit PP 93, 173), most probably ropresents a sound resemblive the Fiench 1, for wbich reasons it must also remain undetermined whether the ayant (=ichdrya) and puya (=pujá) of our inscriptions were intended or not to represent a pronux ciation with a y 
9 The name Abühód doubbless consists of two members, Aba (of uncertain meamng) to ko traced in A Bovions (see Justi's Iramsches Nanonbuch, & 4) + hola, & variant of the hõra in: Spaldhöra and the hôrakd of our inscriptions That spala is & Pahlavi form of O Per spáda Zend spåda - Neo-Pera sipah is plain from its occurrence in Spalapati, which come sponds to the Porslan Ispahbad, Pahlavi Spdhpat (see Justi, opt out and Horn, Neupersischr Etymologie, No 699) As the Zend-Persisa akura sa bised in the sense of 'prince' and as to form höra uk to be traced in the common (Saskadin) nime Hormudas, there on be no reason to doubt that this is the meaning of the second part of the name of Abühöld and that her hórakåparvdra a retadue of princesses (or ladies) 
10 As regards the term Kusůlaa (=Kesilaka of the Tazila Plate), it seems to me extremely unlikely that the word 18 inrelated to the Kuyula, Kujdla Kocovia applied to Kadphises and Kanishka, more especially now that the S&rnith Inscriptions have bronght Kanishka into relation with the northern Satraps The word seens to me to have been prolaisly a title of the order of Şahıb, Barddur, and the lzko

The inscriptions supply in themselves no means of dating But the style of the monument of which tbey celebrate the foundation seems to have been strongly Persian This 18 in favour of an early date, but for a definite deternization of it we past continue to rely upon the more or less contemporary Taxıla plate belonging to the year 78 (in the reiga) of the Great King Môga, who is usually placed (see Rapson, Indian Cuens, $ 29) as early as 120 B 0.

These three inscriptions present the most difficult problems of all those angoribed on the capital They are written in aksharas of approximately the same size As M has no perb (unless we here make use of the -Krakáritu (?) of E" ), we should naturally expeat it to be a connection with one of the others It certainly seems to join the veya of I 1 But here we enter upon a very obsonre passage Buhler with great igennity has elicited the reading vaya udino kadhavaro busaparo kadhavarovêgodirno skandhriváró busaparó skandhiváro, which be renders 'the army has started an haste, tho krmy is intent on wealth' But to this there are, apart from the inappropra tenese of the songe, the following objections - (1) skandhavára does not mean an army,' but an encampment,' (2) the meaning 'rches attached to busa is Atteated only by Wilson's Dictionary, (3) it is doubtful whether the third alshara is really 14, It & unlike the other u'a of these inscriptions and rather resembles am, while the bottom curve may even be a part of the accidental indentation in the stone (Bee the Plate), (4) a weakening of g to y un veya 18 contrary to the tendencies of the languages employed in these inscriptions On the other hand, the ro of 1 2 planly follows the pa of 1 l,and & reading veyaardunan kadhavaro= vaajayantirdi skandhaváró appears bat little promising. The vrya which precedes the large rui in J 1 is in small characters and no doubt an independent addition Can it possibly be an insertion to show that the large wa, which apparently joins on to nothing, 18 an error for vya vya ? The sign which Buhler renders by shto (reproduced in his Indian Palmography, Plate I col xu ), is quute clearly inscribed, but its meanig 18 anything bat clear It is more like rdt, which seems very unlikely With the preceding pale (Buhler puli) at composes no doubt a proper name. What came before pals, occupying a space sufficient for 7 or 8 aksharas, is quite obscure owing to the stone having peeled sway We seem to have the remains of a 8a, but what is to be done with the large rva commencing the lme ? Even adopting the muggestion that it is an error for vya we have no ground for proceeding further The words nussimô kdrsta 924yyatato, '& stopa was caused to be made and presented,' are quute satisfactory We have already noted the older form of ta in kartta With these remarks I must be content so før as these inscriptions are concerned

For the honour uf all Sakastana. 
The objections raised by Dr Fleet (Journal of the Royal Asratrc Society, 1904, pp 703-9, 1905, pp 154-6) to this rendering of Bühler seem to me ineffective As regards the presende of Sakas at Mathuri, see the introductory remarks, where at 18 also shown that the form of the word exactly represents the name of Sakastéra Nor is there any difficulty in the expression of honour to the whole realm of the Sakas, singe we find in the Wardak inscnption (and elsewhere, eg in the inscriptions of Sae Vrhår, Anyor, and various Mathura inscriptions, which have regard to the “good and happiness of all living creatures,' sarvasattvändna) even more comprehenave expressions , nor again is there any difficulty in the use of sarva (uncompounded) with the meaning whole' (see the St Petozabarg Dictionary) As regards suaka, 'one's own,' (a common word), and the Pali sakatthana, 'one's owa place (home, etc ),'ut may be remarked that, while it is natural to say, sue in the passages oited by Dr Fleet,' he went to his own homo,' etc, it seems leas natural to inscribe on the stone 'honour to somebody's) own home,' etc. (This inscription has been recently discussed by M Bartł, Comptes Rendues de l'Académie, 1907, pp 364 ff, with his accustomed perspicacity I an, however, unable to admit that the name of a donor 18 required here any more than in the 178criptions G and A paja addressed to a country is certainly 10180sl, but inscription G. contains a similar päjä addressed to the chief representatives of the Saka dominion ]

For many years afterwards Little was done for the study of the Mount AbQ 118Crip trong But in the cold season of 1900-01 Mr Cousene, Superintendent of the Archeological Sarvey of India, Western Circle, while staying at Abû, had impressions (or, in a few cases, eye

Most of these insoriptons are very short, none of them go baok beyond the middle of the 11th century AD, and conndering their great pomber, the data furnished by them for the poltoal bistory of the country are disappointingly few In ather roepeote, some are of considerable interest and well deserve to be made more generally accessible, while a good many contain somo name, or expression, or dato, or perhaps only home mark or letter, which, animportant as it may seem at first sght, may provo of use on a futuro occasion

Of the inscrip tions at Têjahpåln's temple 77 se dated, and here the earliest dates are of the Vikrama year 1.267 (abont A D 1230), the very year in whioh the temple was founded, while the latest date (in No 1748) 18 one of the (Vikrama) year 1911 (about AD 1854), no less than 17 inscrip tions are cated between the Vikrana year's 1287 and 1297, and 9 between 1346 and 1389 Of the 30 inscriptions at the temple' of Achalèśvara 22 are dated Here tho earliest 10 sciption appears to be one (No 1950), unfortunately almost entirely effaced, of the (Vikrama] year 1186 (about A D 1129), and another (No 1941) seems to oontain a date in the (Vikranaa) year 1191 What I conader to be cortanu 18, that No 1951 of Mr Condens' List 18 dated in the [Vikrama) year 1207 (abont AD 1150), in the reign of the (Paramâral Malámunda léstara Yaśödhavaladêva (a feudatory of the Chaulakya Kamarapala, an inscription of whom is dated

Of the insoriptions at the temple of Néminátha, the two largest and most important, together with 30 aborter ones, haye been edited from Mr Cousong' materials by Prof Luders, Above, Vol. VIII 200 # I now give the text of an insoription of the [Vikrama] year 1378, which is at the temple of Rishabha, and the chief point of interest in which is the statement that that temple was founded in the Vikrame year 1088 (about AD 1031) by a cortain Vimala, who had beon appointed dandapati at Arbada by the Chaulukya] Bhimadêra (1) 
Before I proceed to describe the inscription, I may state that the date here given for the fonndation of the temple is known to us also from other sources In Ind Ant Vol XI p 245, tbe late Dr Klatt gave an extract from a Pattávali of the Kharataca-gachchha, according to which the Minister Vimala, who belonged to the Pôravida (Pragyáta) family, and who broke the parasols of thirteen Sultáns and established the town of Chandråvati, capsed * temple of Rishabhadeva to be built on the mountain Arbnda - temple which even now 18 known by the name Tamala-vasahi,' and which, it is added, was consecrated by Vardhamana stri in the year 1088 The same story, with the same date, is more fully given in the extracts in Prof Weber's Oatalogue of the Berlu MSS, Vol II pp 1036 and 1037, where we are moreovor told that, to obtain from the Bribmaps the ground on which he intended to build the temple, Vimala had to cover it with gold coins, and that he expended 18 crores and 53 lacs (185,300,000) in the building of the temple And the date algo ocorre in an interesting extraot from Jmaprabhasůri's Tirthalalpa, in Prof Peterson's Fourth Report, p 92 f There, again, the Vikrame year 1088 1 given for the foundation of tho Vimala-vasatt, and 1288 for that of tho Lunga-pasata, and it is also stated that, when the two tomplee had been demolished or damaged (thagna) by the Midchchhas, they were repaired in the Saka year 1243 (t e the Vikrans year 1378), the first by Lalla, the sou of Mahanagnban and the other by Pithada, the son of the merchant Chandasimba We shall see below that our maoription actually records the restoration, un 1378, of Vmala's temple by Lalla (Laliga), the son of Mahauasımha, and

MOUNT ABU VIMALA TEBIPLE INSCRIPTION

and of perhaps the last words of verse 21, the original text may everywhere be restored with confidence 
The object of the inscuption is, to record that in the (Vikrama) year 1378 two persons, Lall& (Laliga) and Vijada, for the spuitnal Welfare of their parents repaired the temple of Rishabha (Adinàtha) on the mountain Arbuda And the ingcnption is divided into three parta The first part (verses 1-13) 18 % prasastı or eulogy of the sacred Arbuda, but besides glorfy ing that locality and some mythical or divine beings (Ambika and Srimatâ) residing there, it also gives a few historical details connected with it, and especially records the foundation, 11 the Vikrama year 1088, of the temple of Adınátha by Timala The second part (vv 14-23) contains & rújávali of the chiefs who at the time of the restoiation of the temple were in posges sion of the mountain And the third part (vy 24-38) gives an account of the family of the men by whon the temple was repaired The concluding verses (39-42) record the name and spiritual lineage of the priest or teacher who consecrated the restored building, and the exact date when he did so 
To omit what 18 of no historical interest, the irst part begins with the well-known story bow on the mountain Arbuda there sprang irom the fire-pit (anala-lunda, agmi-kundu) of the sage Vasishtha the hero Paramâra In his lineage appeared the hero Kanhadadova , and 10 his family there was a chief nlained Chandbu (Dhandhuraja), who was lord of the town of Chandravati and who, averse from rendering homage to the [Chaalukya] king Bhimadeva [I ) sad to escape that lang's anger, took refuge with king Bhoja, the lord of Dbørå. The author then, rather abruptly, tells us that in the Prângvâta family there was a distingaished personage named Vimals in whom religion, immerged in darkness through the wickedness of the times, suddenly shone fortk again in its splendour He was appointed by king Bhima dandapati (com bander of the forces or governol) at Arbuda, and there one night was enjoined by the divina Ambika to build on the monntain a beautiful dwelling for the Yugådıbhartrı (Yagidi 710a, Adinatha) That Vimala obeyed the request the author intimates in the verse “I adore the holy Âdinátha who was placed on the top of Arbuda by the glorious Vimala, when one thousand and eighty-eight years had passed since (the time of) the glorous king Vikram maditya" 
The obief Dhandhu or Dhandhurâ ja, spoken of in the preceitmg paragraph, apparently u the Pranâra (or Parsmara) Dhandbuka mentioned above, p 11, whose son Parnapala raled the Arbada territory in the Vikramı years 1099 and 11021 He waald of course bave been a contemporary of both the Chaulakya Bhimadêya I and the Paramâra Bhojadeya of Malaya - Vimala's name occurs in another inscription at his own temple, dated in the Vikrame year 1201 That wscription, No 1767 of Mr Covnens' Liist, contains 10 lmes of writizg which covers a space about 2' 6" long by 55" high, and contains 17 verses In the ink-ımpression the first two lines of it cannot be read with any confidence, but so far as I can see, a man 18 epoken of in them who belonged to the Srimala kula and was an ornament of the Puigvåta vamsa H18 Bon was Lshortha, who was somehow connected with the king Mola (1 a the Ohanlukys Mälarda I ) and was also known by the name Vira-mahattama Labadha bad two was the minister Nêdha, and the second Vimala, who in verse 7 is described thus -

The contents of the second part of our inscription (verses 14-23) I have already girer above, p 81 f This ráidueli 20 verse 14 commences with Åsargja, who belonged to tbe Chá huvanga (Châhuyána, Chåhamåna) family and was king of the town of Nadúla (Naddula After him came Samarasimha; and his son was Mahanasimhabbata ( 15) Theo camas Pratapa malls, and to him was born Vijada, the lord of the Marusthall mandala (o lo He had three sons, the irst of whom was the king Linge (v 17). Verse 18 then eulogi Lundba'who hke a god of death devoured the host of adversarieg,' and verse 19 Lumbba, of whom verse 20 records that he conquered the mountain Arbuda, and that, after having rnlei the earth, he became the lord of heaven (te died) Verse 21 then eulogizes Tejasimhd, the son of Lüniga , verge 22 wishes long life to Tikunako , and the mutilated verse 23 appears to say that Lumbhaka together with.

Regarding the first part of this ragdvali, as far as Vijada, there can be no doubt, and I have nothing to add to what I have proviot)y suid about it A difficulty arison concerning the sons of Vijade. According to the inscription of Lundgadéra, above, p 80, Vijada, who 18 also oalled Daśasyandana (Dabaratha), had fonr 6028 --Lậpangakaria, Landha (Laztaga), Lakshmada, and Lùngvarman, of whom Livanyakarna ia distinctly called the eldest (Jyėshtha). According to the present inscription Vizada had three sons the first (adya) of whom was Lűnige After Lûniga the inscription mentions Lundha and Lumbba, without saymg that they were his younger brothers or in any way specifying their relationship. In my sscount of Lantigadáva's inpoription I havo identified Liaiga with Lâpanyalarna, and have tuksi Landbs and Lumbba to be the names of his brothers, identifying Landha with Lundba (Lantiga) and Lumbha Yith Lũngvarman Other inscriptions are sure to be discovered which mill show whether I Ama mght or wrong In the meantime I feel bound to state that my fnend Mr Ojha, than whom nobody is better acquainted with the history of his country, takes the three names Luziga, Landha and Limbha (Lumbhaka) to denote one and the same person, and to be all Sanskritzed forms of Lumbhå, denoting a chief' commonly called a HT,

Of the remaining five Nøgavamsi inscriptions it has not yet been possible to obtain good impression. They are all in Telagu The Potinär slab seems to refer to Narasimhadâya and the Dautêwerå stone lying outaide the Danteśvari temple to Jayasımbadeva The Bharramgarh inscription contains burudas similar to those found in the Beraûr one, and the king 19 stated in both to be the worshipper of Mâakyadávi (Sri-Manikyadeva-devya-śrípúda-padm-dradioka); which is an older 'name of Daptêsvari, so named by the successors of the Nigayansis, the Kakatiyas, although the latter claim that Danteśvari came with them from Warangal, where she W88 called Manikydávari? This ipsorption lb incomplete and it appears that it was nover completed The Bharremgudi inscription at Dantewârå appears to be the oldest of all, AB 3t8 date appears to be $&ka 984 * The Gadi8 inacmption, apparently of Somêsvaradeva's timo, contains the usaal figures of the cow and calf, Sun and Moon, Siya, eto, the peculiar signs of the Nägevunosi kipgs, although they do not seem to refer to thev family crests They are all picture improcations The sun and moon reprogent that the grant is to last as long as these Inmuames endura S1T& Je the protector against violation of the grant on the spuitzal side, and the dagger and sbisid of the king on the temporal The cow and calf depict the grave sin which the transgressor would commnt, exactly equal to taking away the cow from the calf Thie interpretation is supported by the fact that the Kurugpål inscrption has a representation of en Les associating with a pig, the imprecation being explained in the text thus, Jô (48) anyathi karôtı tasya pata gardabhak sukari mată (he who acts otherwise bas for his father an ass and for his mother a pig) 
From these inscriptions it would appear that Bastar, which has been beld to have always been the home of wild animals, with almost wilder tribes, was once ruled by a people whose Olvilization is sufficiently evidenced by the remams of temples, some of which are of great archi tootural beauty These 128011ptions Cat'y the bistory of Bastar back to the eleventh century AD, when at least the central portion of the State was ruled by tbo Nagayamsi kings They ap parently belonged to the Sında family of Yalbarga, whose titles are strikingly identical with those of the Baatar Nőgayansi kungs Dr Flest states that there appear to have been more branches than one of this famıly One of these was that of Bastar, which has been hitherto unknown These inscriptions disclose the names of five or eux different kings, v12, Dhârâvarsbe, his son Sömestaradhya, and his grandeon Kadharadoya, Jayasıbhadeva, Narasimhadova, and a possible Sômêsvara IL. In view of the fact that half the inscriptions relating to these kings have not yet been o deciphered owing to their incompleteness or want of proper impressions, I reserve a faller discussion of the history of these langs for another occasion

The village document is business-liko and contains abbreviations which were no doubt very well anderstood at that time, but are now difficult to make out It does not indulge 10 genealogies In the gift, however, we are told that Pamparijadeva meditated on the feet of 80marijadérs, who meditated on the feet of Vôpadeva.

I shall discuss this question in another paper on the Sihåwå inscription, which also gives & genealogy of this family.

No 22 - NOTE ON BHUJABALA MAHABAYA 
BY R SEWELL, ICS (Retired) ID Vol VIII 122 # Mr I Krishoa Sastri, BA, publishes an inscription of the Kalasa cluef Bheriya II at Karkala in the South Canara district of the Madras Presidency, and in the course of his discussion on the listory of the family quotes Mr Rice's Müdgere Talaq inscription of 4D 1516 (Mg 41) His comment on this 19 as follow ---" This inscription supplies the interesting information that, duriag the reigo of the great Kishdarîya of Vijaya magara, Bhuzabala-Mahdiaf& led i campaign agaiast the Tula-rajya, and was encamped at the bluzand-s üle iu Mangalûru 
Bauabala-Mahiraya, who led the campaign, must be identical with Krishnariya's elder brother Basbalrao' mentioned on p 110 of Mr Sewell's Forgotten Empure, etc 
There seeing to be a matake here Firstly, I note that Mr Rice does not consider the word Bluzabala in the passage in question to be a proper name The passage* rans- Frjaya. ruuga ada bhajabu lit rather yız? Tulu rájyada mile dandu bandı, and is translated by Mr Rice is The mighty (Thujauzla) Mahiliye of Vijayanagara baving come agaiust the Tula kingdom with a si my" Here there is no rule of leader named “ Bhujbala Mahåriya " Secondly, the leader of the army conld only have been Nunit's “Bisbalao," elder brother of Krishnadeva Růra, if the date of this expedition to the Tuln country were referred to a period at least soven years earlier than the date of the inscription, berjuse - Bushalrao" had died when Krishnadêya ras placed on the throne in AD 1509 It is possible that the cipodition did take place before Krishnadeva's accession, and it equally possible that it may allude to Krislinedôva Rüya's own exploit shortly after he came to the throne, when he, or bir generals, reduced the Ganga Raja of Ummatůl in Mysore The rnention in "Mg 41" of Krishnadeva Raya', supreme sovereignty over the Kalasa country during the chieftainship of Itamadı-Bhairarsa-Odeyar gives us no clue to the date of the Vijayanagara armay's march to Mangalore, for this may have taken place at any period before the date of that chief's graat, wa, Sunday, July 13, A D 1516 But what is quite certain is that the leader of the army referred to could not have been Krishpadêya Raya's elder brother, whom Naaz called " Busbalrao," during; as stated by Mr Krishna Såstīt, the reign of Kfishnaraya , for it was * Basbalrao's" death, according to Nunz, that placed Krishuadêra on the throne 
At the date of the grant Krishnadeva was conducting his decisive campaign in the east, and had captured Kondavida three weeks earlier, t1, on June 23rd, A.D 1516

I begin witb the copper plates, as tl118 is perhaps the most ancient Sanksit inscription yet fonnd in Bastal Mi Baijnath found the plates in the possession of a Bishman named Gangadhai Pâılıı of Kawadgaon close to Rajapura Gangadhar received them from his sister-in-law, who found the billed in a tield at Niharni, sixteen miles from Rajapura 
There are three copper plates, beld together by & ring, soldered into hat was appai ently the Inwel pin tion of a seal, which had been broken off Each plate is about 105' 51" and they heigh 20 30 and 35 tolas, respectively the weight of the ling bemg 20 inlas The plstes are smooth, sufficiently thuck, and in an excellent state of pieseivation They ure inscubed on both sides, esoept the first one, which is inscribed on one sidu only mi T ('s Green, Superintend ent of the Societariat Press, Nagpai, kinilly took for me impressions, which are zeproduced in the accompanying plate 'The plates are puinbered 1, 2, 3, on the maigin, which n as apparently left to prevent the mng holes tiom coming in between the waiten lines The word sri bas been engiaved in the upper mangiu of the first plate, over the figure 1 
The second sido of the thud plate is inscribed with benedictive and imprecatory figures prezi, 12 hands in a row at the top, beneatu which these is to the propor left a cow wiiba bull attaclunt to her neck, and a dagger and a shild beside her feet, a floated linga in the form of # Yastıl in the middle, and a woman palsued by a don key to the peopol ugbt, with the figure of the sun and the moon over at My interpictation of these figures is as follows --The hand, are uplfted, apparently as an expression of beneliotion on the douor, and they ale tielle, probably because there were 12 pátras o donees referred to in the inscription The Cow is apparently drawn to remind us that whosoever appropriates the gifted land, wall llave to reap the same cousaquences which a cow's culse can procluce, or will fall auto the same calamity ag«. COW 18 in when deprived of her calf Siva is shown as the potector against aggre8sion on the spuitua) side, and the iuliag kang's dayyor and shield on the temporal The sun and the noon indicate that the giant is to last as long as tliese laminaries endue Lastly the obscone ógula of an ass associating with a woman is a vulgar imprecation implying that the ti anagressor of gift should be so low-born i 
The 104cription is in the Nâgari character The average size of the letteus 18 7" They alu well formed and clearly waitten 
The language is corrapt Sanskut, and except the hancdictive and imprecatory ve fea, which ale mberted in a somewhat disconnected manncı, the remainder of tho 1140u1ption is prose In fact the whole composition 26 disfornted, and there ale several gi aromatical slips and spelling mistakes

them from the poorer classes of Hindus, procuring them ether to the order of the Khonis or on spoonlation, and they moreover constantly sell as victims therr own children and children of 
ey are the guardians Khonds when in distress, as in tarnes of famine, albo frequently sell their children for victims, considering the beatification of their souls certain and their death for the benefit of manhond, the most honourable possible The Menak grove, & clamp of deep and shadowy forest trees, caually stands at a short distance from the pillage by a nvalet which is called the Meriab stream It is kept sacred from the are and is a yoided by the Khonds aa haunted ground" Bearing these remarks in mind, I now proceed to examine in how far they can throw light on our insoription The Italog in the above extract are mwe, and they should be bome especially in mind, while copsidering what follows In ll 26 to 28 it is stated that "po body enters the chhurprabandha There is no place for the preceptor of yóginis For this pzrpose this village is taken with a view to do good to all living beings" Brom the 16 13 plain that the grant was not made for any spiritual purpose stoh as the increasing of the religious merit of the king and his ancestors, but with a practical carthly aim, vz., in order to secure the welfare of the general public including cattle and other animals The giant was not made to a Brahmana batto & Medipôta (1l 12 to 14) who is styled " Pâtra 12," and to whom 70 gadyánaka gold were given w addition to the village, with the mu dal consent of the kirg, ühis quean, the prince and officers of State as stated in the grant, evidently in order to make the transaction an out-and-ont parchase Hid the donee been a Brihmana, we should have expected a mention of his parentage, gótra and oaste, but no such information is forthcoming in this grant In | 25 Medipôts is called chhurikára, which is probably used in a technical sense having reference to the chhatriprabandha referred to above, and not in the ordinary sense of a knife-maker (black smith) Ian unable to say what chhurnyrabandha really means, but from the context it appears to stand for something like narabalıprabandha, wpparently on account of the great importance of the chhurt or knife in the sacrfice 
With regard to the epithet “12 påtra” I am inclined to believe that Medipôta, whether this word 18 & proper name or the care of an office, was the head of the 12 persons employed in the work of procuring victims So late as 1884 & D, when an investigation was made in Bastar ia connection with kidnapping persons for sacrifice, it was believed that there were 12 villagos gtyen ront-free to kidnappers of 12 families, with whom the stipulation was that in case they could not procure victims from elsewhere, they minst supply them from theu own fannly in con sideration of the free grant they enjoyed Of course the existence of a grant for such a purpose could not be proved, as the sacrifices had been stopped long before the institution of the 10 vestigation. But the tradition of 12 families of mollzahs or kidnappera of victims a bignificant and pounts to a practice which evidently existed in the days of these sacrifces $ I am further zolined to think that Médipòta. Was an office, Méds being the same as Méla or Hellu vulgo Mallick or Malia," the word påta, which in Telaga means a sacrificial victim, bemg dropped. for

the sake of brevity It will now appear that the grant gives sufficient indications pointing to the procaring of a human victima The village 18 soonred as the residence of the preceptor of the gøgnis, who of course dwell in a haunted place, which is naturally avoided by othors The victim is obtained by parchuse, with the mutual consent of the lang and hus subjerts, the grant 18 made to non-Brâhmadas, the bikely persons to take part in such a ceremony, and all this 18 done for the purpose of dayit and dharna to all living creatures Having referred to these mein pomts, I pass over the minor ones which lead to the same conclusion, that the grant was made in favor of procurers of victims for human saciifices If therefore the purpose of the grant 18 really what it appears to be, then I fancy this 18 swiquo record and no sailar inscription has hutberto been ducovered 
Some remarks about the dynasty of the king mentioned in this grant will be found above on pp. 161 and it, where I have dealt with the isomptions of the Någaramśı kinga found in Bestar, most of which are pot yet published and which I propose to edit in due course 48 intimated bofore The dynasty 18 clearly related to the Sunda famıly of Yelburga Though styled "Told of Bhögåvati, the best of oities," Madhurântakadáva appesis to have been a Vandalika (fendatory chef), as the verse in 1 24-25 shows that his réz was limited to Bbiamarakótya, which is described as a mandala in 1 15 He belonged to tihe Chhindaka family, one of the 36 Agrikulas? mentioned by Ohand Bardal, the court poet of Prithviraja 
With regard to tbe localities mentioned in the record, Rajapura is identical with the prosent village of the same name, 22 miles north-west of Jagdalpur (the capital of Bastar), on the bank of the Indravati niver There are ruins of a fort there, and it is believed that it was once a royal capital The present Raja family also dweit there for some time Chakrakótya je, I feel little doubt, the town mentioned by the Kashmirian poet Bilhand in his Vilcranuinkadêvacharta, in whicb he records that Vikrama 28 yuvarāja set out on & series of varlıke expeditions, Fith the pormi85107 of bis father He repeatedly defeated the Cholas and plundered Kabchi Ho Assisted the lang of Malavà, un regaining his kingdom and carried his arms as far north as Gauda and Kamarûp. He attacked also the king of Sumbals or Ceylon, destroyed the sandal wood forests of Malaga Hills and slow the lord of Kerala He finally conquered Gångakunda (IV. 21) Vôngi (IV. 29) and Chakraköts (IV 30) After having accomplished these brilliant exploits Vikrama turned homewards, and, on coming as far as the Krisbuậ, he was suddenly disqnieted by the news of his father's death Dr BuhlerTemarks that “Bilhana's rhapsodio treatment of thus portion of Vikrama's career makes it imposaible to determine the chronologioal order of these Wars Only so manch may be considered certain that his last exploits were performed in the soath as he cano on bus homeward march to the Krishna,” There can be po doubt about those exploits of Vikrams They were, as related above, the conquest of Gångakuņda, Véngi and Chakrakóta, end at least these seem to have been conquered in the order in which they have been mentioned Güngakanda was the Chola capital, atuated in the north-east corner of the Trichinopoly district, whence Vikrama proceeded north to Vêngi, the country between the Krisha

But to the identibcation of this prince with the Varmalåta of our insonption, supposink the date VE 682 to be correct it as possible to raise an objection As every student who hem read the Suupilaradha knone, Migha u his work distinctly alludes to the owo zrazumatich treatises, the Kitsekuivritts and its commentary called Nylist. The former 19 the joint prodnoti 
of Jayaditya and Våmana, and, with regard to the former author, the Chinese traveller I-tsing 12forns as in unmistakable terms that he died alont AD 661-662 It should, moreover, b brorue iu mod that the author of the Nyúsg was Jinêndrabuddhi, who like Jayaditya wae & fol lower of the Buddha Aad 15 16 130onceivable that I-tsing, one of whone principal objects in comung to India was to collect information about Buddhist authors, could have passed him over in silence, if the latter had foughed before AD. 695 when the Chinese traveller's departure fronu India took place The concluson 19, therefore, irroslatible that the anthor of the conld not have lived before the filst half of the 8th century Magba, therefore, has to be asagoed to the latter part of the 8th century This line of argament adduced by Prof Pathaker Appears to me to be worklı considering Di Konow, however, informs me that he does not think it convincing He says, "the argumentum ex silentio 18 always unsafe,, and, sven if we admit that Jinêndrabuddhı cannot have written before AD 695, that cloes not disprovo Professor Kjelhor a's identification of our Varmalåta with the king those minister Magha's grand. lather 98%. Our inscription may very well date from # time previous to his appointment 4 muister, and it does not, at any rate, make it impossible to bring Magha down to the first twenty yeals of the 8th century There is nothing to binder us from supposing that Jindndrabuddhi Hourished about A D. 700, The alleged reference to his work in the futurtlavadha would, I thuk, be more intelligible if we szppose it to have been a new work at the time when Magba wrote his poem" 
I quite accept Dr Konow's main conclusions But I agree with Professor Patbak that the argumentum et salentra carries some weight in this pertronlar instande One of the chief objects I-tsing had in view was to gather all avalable information abort Buddhist atthons in India. 
he hun even mentioned his own contemporaries, it is very unlikely that he should have failed to notice Jinêndrabuddhi, If the latter had sotually shieved fame in his time se pointed out by Dr. Konow, there is, however, nothing to prevent us from consdor ing Maghs and Jinondrabaddha as contemporanes The more fact that one author quotes another ond, only shows that he cows him, and not necessarily that he belongs to a ister time Migba and Jmondrabaddh can, therefore, very well both have lived at the beginning of the eighth century, and Professor Kielhorn's identification of the two Vermal&tas remains unaffected by Professor Pathak's argument

198 
No. 26. -- DAULATABAD PLATES OF TEE RASHTRAKUTA SANKARAGANA, 
SAKA-SAMVAT 715 
BT D R BHANDARKAR, MA, POONA These plates were in the possession of a Tonga walla, nemed Bhan Derram Bhut, a Brabma kshatri by caste, and residing at Daulatábåd, in the Nizam'a territory They seem to have been preserved as beirloom in his family, and, according to the account given by km, it appears that they were given to bis great-grandfather a8 & sanad. The plates were obtained on loan by me from the owaer tarough Maulvi Syed Mohammad Bigrami, Fırat Tilakdår, Aaangåbåd district, who was kand snough to accede to my request promptly 
There are three plates, each of which measures about 73" long by about 5" broad The firat plate is inscribed on one side only, and the remaining onas on both sides The edges of the inner sides of them are fashioned slightly thicker'80 es to protect the writing, and the 11.8crap tion is, on the whole, 12 % atate of almost perfect preservation The plates are strung on circular nog, the ende of which are joined together by means of a knob bearing & roagbly round seal, containing, 11 relief on a countersank surface, a representation of Garuda, squatting and faoing full-front, his hands are joined, palm to palm, on the chest, and are turned upwards, his legs rest one upon the other, and two projections at the sides denote his wings 
The obaracters of the onginal inscription belong to the northern class of alphabets provarl. ing in the 8th century. With regard to the forms of individual lettera, attention may be drawn to d, eg in Åsi*, 1 %, to , which looks almost exactly like me, e g. la "pulina", 1 12, to nga in bhanga, 1. 14, to nka in Sri-Sankarayongrtija, 1 27, to rya in vryd, 120, and to acha in paschabhx", 1 35 The alphabet also includes signs for the numerals 7, 1, and 5 in line 41 The last Biga in almost exactly like that for 5 given in the Såmangadb grant of Dantidurga, where the date 18 also expressed in Yorde. No reasonable doubt can, therefore, be entertained as to the correct reading of the date of our inscription The language is Sanskrit Up to almost the close of line 24 the inscription 18 12 yerse, and two benedictive and imprecatory yerses occur in lines 38-40, the rest 18 un prose The number of yerses at the beginning 18 12 OF these, verbes 1-9 also occur in other early Rashtraküla records The remaining three Terses are peoular to this inscription, and are historically important The whole of line 31 after the word vya(bra)hmachari and a part of the Ime following have unquestionably been tampered with. They contained names of the dozee and the village glated, which have been cancelled and replaced by new ones by heating the plates and beating in the letters originally engraved The boundaries of this new village are specified after abont the middle of line 42, where the original insoription toolly enda, down to line 55 The letters of these 11a08 are &Carelessly written and 28 of exactly the same type as those incised in lines 31-32 past referred to Lanes 42-55 are thus & contiquation of the forgery commenced in hpes 31-32 In respect of orthography, the lotter b is throughout denoted by the sign for y, there is an indifference about the doubling of consonants after r, the usarga 18 often wrongly omitted, the vowel re 19 employed instead of ru in bhüpasztrovishtapa, 1 Kanakidr**8=undrarajah, 1 8, and pray-d[tma*]jah, 1 24, the letter 9% is employed instead of h once in ritja-sumghan, 1 4, and an anurvára un conjunotion With & following is changed to that letter once in dhuasten-naya", l. 2. 
Tho inscription records a grant by Samarávalóka sri-lankaragang-raja of the Rashtraküte family In the introductory metrical portion, his genealogy is given, beginning with Govinda rája I. The gonealogy set forth as far as Krishnaraja I 18 in verses 1-9 which, as already said, are to be met with in many other grants of this dynasty, and which consequently teach us nothing new It then desorbes Govinda II in the following words in Terse 10, oooupying 11. 19-21 and bearing a double entendre “His son was king Covindaraja who was like Hari (Krakpa) inasmuch but both were fond of battlog, znamuch as the formox was celebrated for

having snatched away the glory of Sri-Pärjäta jast as the latter pas for having carried off t. greatness of the auspicions pitrajúta (tree), and Idasnuch as the prowess of his arms wag skDF by the former by sapporting Govardhana just as it was shown by the latter by uplifting the Govardhana (mountain)" The mythological sense is clear enough, and, besides, the young serta to show that Govinda II defeated & king of the name of Parijata, and made alliance with, and espoused the cause of, another prince called Govardbane 1 The names Pârijå ta and Govardhara &re zew, and have not so far been met with 20 epigraphio records Then follows a verge (11) whick 18 as important as it is unfortunately corrapt But if the amendations proposed by me an accepted, the following appears to be its songe "His younger brother was Nirupame, who, co pe2ceiving him self-concerted, abandoned by (feudatory) princes, and even deprived of police, assumed the royal authority placed (in the hands of a person) other than one possessed of deva tion for the elders, in order that the sapereignty might not deviate from the family" What the verse MBADA 1B that Govinda II was a self-conceited ruler and resorted to bad polioy, which resulted in the regal anthority being held by a person who had no respect for the Rightrakata sovereigns that preceded him, and consequently created disaffection amongst his feudatory chieftains, who desorted him, and that Dhruva Nirupama fearing that the sovereignty would pass away to another dynasty, was compelled to take the rains of the government into his hands and thus inle over his brother's dominions The Dehli and Karhad grants of Krishna III, however, give a slightly different account They record that "sensual pleasures made Govindaraja careless of the kingdom, and that, entrasting fully the universal sovereignty to his younger brother, Nirupama, he allowed luis position as sovereign to become loose " The discrepancy in the tvo accounts 18 with regard to whether Dhrava-Nirupama was actually ontrasted by Govinda II with the management of the kingdom, the Deoli and Kaubad gianta saying that it w28 to, bit our anscription implying that it was not so, as it was left to the care of one who was anything but attached to the Rishtrokuta family s Bat the facts, the actual occurrences, mentioned in our charter, whol is the earlier of the two and consequently more reliable, could not have been distorted, though the motives might have been coloured and differently expressed, and hence what most probably happened was that Gôyinda II gave himself up to sensual pleasures en: allowed the government of his kingdom to slip into the hands of a person other than Dhruve, and not of Dhruva himself, as the Deoli and Karhad grants claim, and whether it was to remove the danger thereby caused to the stability of the Rashtrakūta supremacy, as the motive 18 stated in our inseription, or, what is more likely, his mud lasted after soveroignty, for securing 
d opportunity had presented itself when Govinda II gave himself up to yicl13 courses, Dhruva-Narupama was successful in making himself ruler of his brother's dominions 
Verse 12 informs as that the paternal unole of (Dhraya-)Nirapama was Šri-Nauna, brother of Sri-Krishnarád& and son of þri-Kakkaraja Then follows the preamble of the przed passage which usually precedes the formal part of a copper-plate inscription, and therein the

panic of the granto: Samaráveloka-Śil-Sankaragane-râja 15 specified and he is mentioned as son of Sri-Nagna just zeferred to It is worthy of note that no titles have been coupled with his name He was thus not even a feudatory chieftain It is, therefore, no wonder that he is spoken of as 18sing the charter with the express consent of Sri-Kalivallabha Narendradêya The latter yes doubtless an epithet of (Dhruva-)Nirupama, who was then the paramoubt Sovereigu and whose cousin Sazkaragand was The proper object of the inscription is alates 123 11 28-83, but, as said above, the names of the original donee and the villoge grauted to him winch were engraved in ll 31-32, have been erised, and nevy ones incieed in characters which, though old, ale uot quita legible The only particular wluh has survived of the original grantee is that he had einigrated from Tenvi, and the expression tat-privat-púzcentium 410) % delsskirit, which occurs 1u 33, shows that he was the preceptor of Sankaragaria L100 34 36 contain a request to future ralers to respect the donation, and threaten with spiritual punish ment those who might rescindi at Lives 37-40 quote two of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verges And the original inscription then concludes thus " And this charter pas wntton by Chandayika by order of the supreme rutor, when 715 years bed elapsed in accordance with the ora of the Saka Kings" The auproms ruler here alluded to us (Druys-) Nuupam 4, and the Saka year 715 met consequently refer to be reign The earliest record--- the Paulian giant- of his son and successor Gorinda III 1.9 dated in Siia 716 It is thue plain that (Dhruva-) Nu upama could not have lived long after Sala 715 when our grant was made 
After this commences the second pait of the forged record It has been mentioned above that ile names of the grantee and the village granted engraved in the original 13:301iption in 112e 31-32 have been omsed, and new ones substituted fou thom by beating in the previous letters The name of the new giantae cannot be made out, bnt his gútra specified is Bhâlad. Vája Secondly, the name of the new village inolsed appears to be something like Samira And it is the boundaries of the village that tre now specibed in hnos 42-58 aftei the completion of the old genuine inscription The Names are written 80 carelassly and the composition 8 10 full of grammatical Inaccuracies that it is not possible to be hero definite about anythung In line 52 is given the espression rall(ile)lhu-nur indra which is an epithet gansally borne by the Rishtrakůta raleis The coupestion of this expı esazon, however, with what precedes and follows 18 not clear The forged docament ends with Sri-Biratc (til), la mutak || 800 The vame Bludinka l'ominds one of the 113soriptions of the Valablia priices, and if the minerals taken for 800 are correctly resd and zepiesent a date, 48 is bighly probable, it must be referred to the Falabhı era, and it thus becomes equivalent to AD 1119 which may be taken to be the date of the fabrication of the forged record. Our copper-plate cbarter, as has been said at the outset, was in the possession of a pelson from Daulatå bed, a Brabmakshati i by caste, and has been preserved in his family as beirloom As Biabınaksliatzis in the Dekkan are koown originally to have come from Katbikwår, it is not likely that gonobody in his family, after socuring these plates tampered with them in order to age them as documentary evidence to strengthen his otherwise disputable claim to the village therein mentioned, and it is but natural that he should engreto the name Bhatárka after the manner of the Valabhi pletes which he must have erther seu bimself 10 Kathåwår or known about from his forefathers

preserved writing which covers & space of about 2'41" Lugh hy 11) broad The characters belong to the northern class of alphabets They include the somerhat 1are forms of gh, and 1. and the numeral figuros 8. 7, and 2 Attantion may also be diawn to the way in whirh the letters sandale engraved With regard to the latter thare 15 no difference between it and is cxcept that the apper for tical strokes in the case of the format a a m: how ert euch Oller than in the case of the latter The language : Sanskrit, bat aß anyt og but grammatical and the whole & in prose. In respect of orthography, 18 doubled il conjunction with a following i, dht 18 written adht AW100 in the word nahurojiddharta, and there is a tendency to use the dental sıkılant instead of the palatal, though in one ouse the latter is substituted for the foumer 617 in suttradhirah, 1 20 
The inscription 36 dated Samvat 8721 the ifth of the bright fortnight of Chaitra, and refers itself to the reign of the P M P Nagabhatta-déva meditating on the feet of the M. P Vatsaraja-dôva. It is thus clear that Nagabhatta is no other persou than Nagabhata, son of ValBuTÁJA, of the imperial Pratibâra dynasty wieldung eway over the larger portion of North India Of the princes of this royal family we have had but few dates earlier then the time of Bhöjadðva I In fact, we had only one date, pa Saka 705=AD 783-84, for Vattarija fui Dished by the Jaina yoik Haruvamsa-Pur únice And our insciption now supplies the second date, V.S 872 A D 815 for his son Nagabhata 
The paport of the 199cription, however, is not quite cleay Something 18 and therein tu have been set up (arvéstti), bat what that something' was is far from evident Thils something, we are told, was set up, after building the temple (divagraha) and worshipping the feet of Paranešvara, in the village of Rajyaghangakam, by the queen Jayávali, the danghter of Jajjaka, who bimself was a son of the Pratihára Bapuks, and wfe of Bhumbhuvaka, the son of Haragupta of the family called Arenganaka As Jüyávali has been spoken of as queen (rújft), her husband must have been some kind of ruler, most probably a obiektuin, feudatory to Nagabhatta, and reigning at, or, at any rate, holding Riyagban gakım, which must be supposed to be the old name of Bachkala The name of the sütiadhera or mason 18 Pažohaharı, the son of Dêzê 
The temple is, as we have seen, and to have been dedicated to Parambivara, which is uaually taken to be a name of Siya Thus, howevei, does not agree with the sculptural details 
image iu the sanctum But on the dedicatory block on the ghzine door and in the punopal niche at the back, the images in Whioh enable one to determine to what god the temple is dedicated, is a figare with four hands, doubtlessly representing some form of Vishn , as the mace, di8008, and conch-shell can be distinctly seen in itu hands Other imagea, also carved on the inner and outer walls of the temple, show that it was a Vaishnava atractuie The word paramésvara nust, therefore, be taken in its ordinary sense and as leferring to Vishnu.

KENDUR PLATES OF KIRTIVARMAN II

The places were found at Kêndür, a village in the Khed tlaka of the Poona district They belong to Mr Parushottama Rajapathak, nor residing at Kendûr There are five plates, the first and the last of which are inscribed on one side only The plates are equal in size. measuring 9" long hy 4" broad Their edges are raised into rims to protect the wnting The reg on which the plates are strong is aboat half an inch thiok and 51" in diameter The soll on the ring 18 oval, meskuring 2" by 14" It has, la relief, on a countereuuk Burface, A standing boar faoing to the proper left The weight of the plates, together with the ring and seal, is 223 tola. The inscription is in state of excellent preservation The characterg belong to the southern class of alphabets The language 18 Sangkut throughout, and with the exoeption of the invocatory Forse at the beginung and the benedictive and imprecatory verses At the end, the whole 18 in prose 
The grant is one of the Western Chalukya king Kirtiverman II., and in isaned from the aty of Raktapura, which is probably to be zdentified with Lakshmêsvara, in the Dharwar district. It records that on the full moon day of the month Vaisakha, dunng & Lunar colipse, in Saks 672 expired, in the sixth year of his reign, when his victorious camp was at Raktapura, Kirtivarman II, at the request of his great queen, granted to a Brihmane named Råmasarman, the village of Beppatti in the centre of the villages of Pembesaru, K18umat. galam, Sullam and Perbbally, in the distriot of Valvola The five villages can be early identified with Behatti, Hebbar, Kusugallo, Sulla sud Hebballi, in the Dharwal district Vel yola 18 a Sanskritized form of Bolvola or Belvala, a name which 18 applied even at the present day to a portion of the southern Marath& country 
Before the discovery of the present grant, only three records of Kirtivarman II's time were known to scholars Of these the most important in the Valkalérı grant, which has been published by Mr Rice and re-eciited by Dr Kielhom” As intorpieted by these scholars, the date of that grant 18 Saka 679 expired, which is spoken of as the eleventh year of Efrtivarman's reign, while, according to the pre-ent grant, Baka 672 expired was the sixth year of his reign These two statements cannot be reconciled It 18, however, important to note that the present grant wah lgsued fivo years earlier, and is perfectly legible throughout. It also mentions the occurrence of & lunar eclipse Therefore the dato in this grant, which admuts of verification, is correct But in the Vakkalêrı grant, the first word describing the Saka year is not legible Both Mr Rice and Dr Kielhorn hava proposed to read it as hava, mine, and this view has been endorsed by Dr Fleet But the proposed emendation does not agree with the present inscription, according to which Saka 677 expired was really the eleventh year of the king's reign 
The historical information in the present grant may be briefly summarised thus The first king of the Chalakya line was Polekesin who performed borse sacrifices Then came his son Kirtivarman I, who defeated the kings of Vana vági and other countries His brother Mange Hóa being passed over, we are next introduced to Satyasraya, better known as Potekeáin. II., who defeated the famous Boddhist king Harsha vardhada, the patron of the illustrious Chinese traveller Hinen Talang and the hero of Bana's immortal work, the Harshackar ita Polekéén II's son, Vikramaditya I, was the next king, who recovered, hy means of hua horse Chitrakantha, part of the Chalukya dominiona, which had been overrun by the Pallayas, and had obeisance done to him by the lord of Kanchi, who had bowed down to none other, 
nd successor was Vinayaditya, who broke the sontederacy of the Cholas, Keralas, Pâpdyas and Pallaves, and dofeated the paramount sovereign of Northern Iudia. Vinayaditya'a son Vijayiditya, the next king, had greatly assisted L13 father and grandfather in their wars Though suddenly taken prisoner by the enemy, whom he had pat

(Continued from yol VIII. page 274) From the materials supplied to me by Rai Babadur V Vonkayya I pabligh here, with the resalts of my calculatoas, twenty-two nore dates of Chola kinge (Nos 137-158), and two dates (Nos 159 and 160) of the king Parusiagedêya, " who claims to be a Pallays and who subverted the Chola sovereignty abond AD 1231-32" Five of these dates (Nos. 145-149) belong to the king Rajadhiraja (II) RåjakéBarivarman, of whom no datas have yet been published, and whose reign these dates with great probability show to have commenced between (approximately) the 28th February and the 30th Marob A D 1103 The other dates id general merely confirm the correctness of the resalts previously found for the commencement of the reigns of the kings to whom they belong, but No 142 redaces the period, doring which Rajaraja II must have commenced to leign, to the time from (approximately) tbe 8th April to the 11th July AD 11482 
I am still keeping back a number of dates of Kulóttanga-Chola II Rajakesarıparman in the hope that more dates of this king may be discovered before long 
At the end of this arbole I give a list of all published dates of Chola kings that have been examined by me, with approximate statements of the time when each king commenced to rega

I have previously found that Rajaraja I. commenced to reiga between (approximately) the 25th Jane and the 25th July AD 985. This date of the 5th year of his reign corresponds to Suoday, the 1st December A.D. 988, which was the 8th day of the month of Dhanus, and on which the first tatht (of the bright half of Pausha) commenced 5 h 6 m, while the nakshatra was Mola, by the equal space system for 16 h. 25 m, and according to Garga for 3 h 56 m, after mean sunrhe.

In accordance with the previously obtained regults, this data should fall in AD 1161, BLE time before the 24th March (the first day of the month of Mêsha), but with the actual runding of the original it would be incorrect In my opinion, the fifth tathi (pañ[ 30m2]yum) has here been quoted enoneously instead of the seventh (saptamıyum), and the date corresponds to Monday, the 6th March AD. 1181, which was the 12th day of the month of Mind, and on which the 17th Arth of the bright half (of Chaitta} ended 3!

In a postscript I give a date of a king Rajakosarivarman Viru-Pandya, acrording to Mr Venkayfa a ruler of Kongu, which quotes both tlie Saka year 1202 and the regual rear 15, both given in voida This date 18 of couaderable interest, because my calculatııng proti its meaning to be this, that the day of the date fell u the 15th year of the king's Tegu which (reigo) commenced in the Saka year 1202 (and not, that the day of the date itselí fell v the Saka year 1202) The data thus suggests another point of doubt and uncertainty icgarding the interpretation of dates that do not contaid sufficient data foi exact veribcation, even scher, at first sight such doubt seems to be ont of the question

"In the Saks year one thousand two hundred and two, the fifteenth year of the Tergs) of king [Ra]jakesari Farman alies the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Vire-Pandyedêya, on the day of Uttara-Phaiguni, vluch coresponded to the tenth titt LD to a Monday of the second fortught of the month of Tula" 
The meaning of this date would neturally be taken to be that the day of the date fell both in the 15th year of the king's reign and in the Saka year 1202, either current or expued , bet for either of these Saba year's the dute would be incorrect 
For the orient Sahe year 1202 the date might be taken to correspoud to Monday, the end Octobe AD 1279, włuch was the fth day of the month of Talà, and on wluch the 10th title of the derk half (of Àśpina ) ended. 2 h 37 m after mean siznise But the ruhshatras on t1118 day were Maghi aud Pärva-Phalguni 
For the expued Saka year 1202 it would correspond to Saturday, the 19th October AD. 1280, wluch vad the 22nd day of the nonth of Tul), and on which the 10th futh of the dark half (of Åsqua) ended 18 lı 25 m, wlule the rahshatra was Púrva-Phalguni, by the Biała siddhinta for 11 l 10 m, according to Garga foi 15 h 46 m, and by the equal space ayateet from 3 , 17 m, atter incanı sun ise 
The date would bo iucorrect also for the Šaka year 1200 (current or expired) and for all Foars down to Saba 1211 expued It would be correot for Saka 1215 expired (= 1218 current), For this year it would correspond to Monday, the 28th October A D. 1293, which was the 29th day of the month of Tulê, and on which the 10th tithi of the dark half of Kárttiks) ended 6 h 52 m. after mean suzu ise, while the nakshatra by all systems was Uttars-Phalguai during the whole of the day 
I have no doubt that Monday, the 36th October A D 1298, is the proper equivalent of tho date; and, in accordance with this result, I take the trus meanmg of the original date to be thus, that the day of the date fell in the 15th year of the king's reign which commenced some time during the (current) Saka year 1202 AD. 1379-80) that 19 quoted at the beginning of the date For dates that have to be simularly interpreted, I may refer to Nos 261, 262 and 269 of my Southern Inst

on a Sunday corresponding to the Asyatı-nakshatra in the month Vrischika when the planet Jupiter stood in the constellation Tula Professor Kielborn kindly contributes the follofing 1 emal ks on the date --If the date were correct. y recoidod, it would corespond, for the year 149 of the Kollam era, to Sunday, the 9th November AD 973, rhich was the 15th day of the month of Vrischika, and on which the ilth title of the bright half of Margasira ended 11 h 12 12 , whilo] the nakshatra was Röyati for 16 h 25 mm, after mean sunrise, and Asyini (Asvatı) for the rest of the day on the same day Jupitei's mean longitude was 191" 44', and his true longituds 1954 27', 4 8 in either case Jupiter was in the sign Tula" 
* The difficulty here is, that the day should have been described as the day of the nakshatra Aéyini, when this nakshatra only commonced 16 h 25 m after mean sunrise, and I have no doubt whatever that either Aśvini (Aivatı) has been quoted erroneously instead of Répati, or Sunday instead of Monday If the week-day were B[onday, the date would regularly colzespond to Monday, the 10th November A D 973, the 16th day of Vrischika, when the nakshatra Tas Aśvini (Asyati) for 16 h, 25 m. after mean sunrise, and when 
Jupitor of course still was in the sign Tuld" 
The inscription informs as that Umaiyammai of Tirukkalayapuram, daughter of Âdichchan, set up a bhattrake (image) in the temple et Ayurûr The king Śrivallarangôdai made a gift of land to Umaiyamma for the purpose of keeping up the services of the battirakur set up in the Ayurtr temple, and she, in her turn, made over the sabject matter of the gift to the Tiruchchengunrûr temple, in order that it might be placed under the management of the Poduvals of that temple From the produce of the land 90 given, the Portucils of the toinplo of Tiruchchengunrûi had to supply to the temple daily 4 nders of nice for daily offerings and annually 200 parars (of 9 9dbus each) of paddy If the word udar used in 1 18 was really meant to be used in the sense of 'of or belonging to,' the ingcripton would waitant us to draw the conclusion that Umaiyamma was a near relation of Brivallayangoda ---- either mother or wife It would then be more probable to consider her as his wife than as his mother, as the passage Srívallavangódczy=udar Adrshchan=Umaiyammar means Ådichchan Umaiyammai belongmg to Srivallavango da. She might perhaps be the daughter of the Chola king Åditya II, to whose time this record belongs 'If, on the other hand, udarle a mistake for edar then no sort of relationship need exist between the two 4 
The inscription employs several peçubar terms which require some explanation each The word attippéru (11 8 and 19) implies 'soquisition by the pouring of water' This mode of acquisition differa from others, such as purchase, etcThe meaning of the expressions kilidir and adany=idu is not definitely known Kil-idu literally means that which is placed under,'! and davy:īdz, that which is placed in the middle' A piece of land placed under the manage ment of a person was perhaps called a loihidu with reference to that person If this person eublet to a third party, the person subletting seenas to be the rdarysidan, e ho is the middle mon between the owner of the property and the sub-tenant It is in this sense that the passages of the 20scription, in which these terms oacur have been translated.

the three-fourths of a vatten (aucnit or group of villages),' and the use of the bhatiaka instead of bhattijaki preclade the possibility of ata being « Bhagavati temple in the present instance How nukletlvatten came to meso z Bhagirati temple 18 not known The menung of the expressions Sirrúrnad al and Sirtûnadda-tandam 19 not clear Hence they have been tentatively translated as "the custom obtaining in small towns" and "the frelenied in accord. ance with the custom obtaining in small towns" 
The places mentioned in this inscription are _Kollam, Tirukkalayapuram, Ayirür, Tiruchchongunrur, Idaiyamanan, Murunnaiyur, Manalmukku, Pupalar and Kudagöttür Of these Kollam, Ayırür and Tiruchchengunyûr are the modern Quilon, Agirur and Chengunnûrs (the head-quarters of the tâluka of the same name) 1o North Travancore Idaiyamanan might be identified with Edaman, # station on the Mapiyachi-Quion branch of the South Indian Railway, and Panalür is another station on the same line I am not able to identify the rest.

No 33 -THREE EARLY BRAHMI INSCRIPTIONS 
By Professor H. LUDERS, PED, ROBTOOK I--BRITISH MUSEUM STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF KANISHKA 
On the occasion of a viat to the British Museum in the antamn of 1906, I discovered in one of the cases of the Northern Gallery the stone bearing the subjoined inscription, which, 88 far as I know, has never been published before At my request impression8 Ware taken, from which I have prepared the transcript Subsequently Dr Fleet kindly sent me the photograph of the stone reproduced in the accompanying plate 
Nothing seems to be known about the origin of the stone, but the characters, the language and the date of the inscription prove that it comes from Northern India 
The sonlpture at the top of the stone repregents a mua and a woman sitting on a bench The woman to the left, wearing & loin-cloth and a girdle and the usual ornaments round the beok, the wrists, the ankles and in the lobes of the ear, rests her left olbow on the knee of her left leg which she has placed on the top of the bonoh, and turns ber laughing face to the spectator, The male person alao 18 prearing a necklace, bracelets, ear-drops, and a dhoti covermg the knees. He is sitting Astride, and with the mght hand he touches, or points to, & sort of stand placed between the two persons on the bench and bearing what would seem to be ashion adorned by three small square marks and supporting some bell-shaped object Right over the head of the man there appears something which at first sight looks almost like a olub, bat which in my opinion probably la the matilated head of a cobra As the stone is broken off immediately above the head of the female person, it is quite possible that her head also was overshadowed by a similar representation of a serpent's head, and it seems to me very probable therefore that the Eculpture represents a NÅge and his wife. 
The writing is Brahmi of the earlier Kuahana type The subaoript ya 1a expressed by the full sign, and the sha shows the old form with the small cross-bar The language is the usual mixed dialect The inscription, which is dated in the tenth year of baharij& dēvaputre Kaņishka, records the gift of a temple. "Details will be discussed below.

TRANSLATION Success In the year 10 of the mahirija dévaputra Kanishka, in the second (month of) simmer, on the ninth day, on that (date specjied as) above a temple was given in the northern püramiket (9) May the goddess of the village be pleased! 
NOTES 
The orthography of the inscription is very inegular, double consonants, long vowels and the antara being frequently not expressed in writing Along å appears in the word harmya According to the St. Petersburg Dictronary the same form 19 found also in the l'artt år VI, 6, 2 instead of the ordinary harmya occurring in the corresponding verse in Atharvav XVIII, 4, 55 In Harmyan-datan the final m 1s converted into the nasa) before the following mate, which 18 larg in inscriptions in this duelect Another instance is found in the concluding words of the Mathuê inscription, above Vol I p 388, No 8 priyatim-bhagavan=Rishabhasrih, which at the same time help us to understand the phrase found at the end of the present record priyatim dets grámasya. 
Of greater interest is the spelling of the kung's name, Kanishka, with a long vowel in the first syllable and a lingael With regard to the latter point, the seven Brâhmi inscriptions that have preserved the name are in perfect agreement In the Kharoshthi inscriptions of Sus Vihêrs and Leda & the name is read as Kanishka, in that of Manikyala as Kansshka,* but I thin by Do means sure whether in the two last mentioned inscriptions the readings Kanushka and

Kaneshha would not be preferable On the whole, contemporal y records certainly are in favour of the spelling with the lingual 2, and I would theicfole piopose to use Kanyh ka as the common form of the name The spelling with the long Towel in the first qilable as in the pz eseot inscrip tion is unusual, but it does not stand quite alone In the Sarnath inscuption, No 34, the editor, It is true, reads Kaneshlasya, but the photo-lithograph distinctly allows Kinshlasya 
Tuining to the special object of the inscription, ye may zzfer from the concluding words that the temple was dedicated to a goddess, and tho iepieseutation of the two Nayas above the 1nscrip tion makes it not unlikely, I think, that the goddess intended was a Nagi That doing the Kushans period thele existed tomples for the woisbip of 643 pents in Northern India, 15 well attested by the two Mathula inscription, which mention the icmple (st[1]cna) of the riigendia Dadhikurna and a dei vant at the terople of the same Dadhibauna (Dadirlarnnada.vihullues)

The orthography shows the usual features The lengthening of the vowel in dánda appegre again in the same word in the Sut-Mahet Lascription, above Vol VIII, p 181, and We may further compare suoh forms as imtersisa and amt eviêariye in the Mathorâ inscriptions, Ep.

de regards the date, the ürst symbol of the date of the year requires & faller consideration, As it has been differently interpreted As already stated above, it hes the shape of & St Andrew's cross Cunninghami originally read it as 40, and he was followed by Dowson, who in editiog the Mathuri inscriphons everywhere adopted Canninghat's readings of the dates * In 1891 Bubler expressed his belief that the sign really reprosented 70,8 and this opiuon was endorsed 10 the following year by Cuoningham in his paper on the counts of the Kushanas in the Numisnatio Chronicle, Ser III Vol XII p 50, note 6 
I accordingly read the symbol as 70 when I pablished the inscription in the Indian Aftquary, and I am still copyinced that Buhler was right, bat in order to settle this question definitely, it will be necessary to samine the other Northern Brahmi insoriptions where the same sign occurs They are the following seven, all of which come from Mathura or its neigh. bourhood - 
(1) Mathuri inscription of the time of evilmin mahdlsllatrapa Sodâga, Ep.

And lastig in Ep Ind Vol IV P 55, note 2, he stated that he would now remove the alternative reading 42, which he had thought adonisabla at first

EPIGRAPHIA INDIJA 
(VOL IX, 
It thug appears that the symbol has lutherto been treated sometimes as 40 and sone times as 70, but it will be really conceded, I think, that it is impossible to assign two different values to the same bigo in 1NBcı iptions of the same locality and the same period But before 18 can deoide which of the two interpe etations 19 the correct one, we shall have to examine also the other symbols supposed to represent eithe 40 or 70 in the early Brahmi uscipions of Northern India The following inscriptions, which for convenience sake I number in continuation of the list given above, must be taken into consideraiion 
(8) Mathari inscription of the time of mahardja Huvikshe, Ep Indo Vol I p 587, No 9, and Plate The symbol iesenbles the ligatare pta and was read by Buhler as 40

(10) Mathurâ inscription, Arch Suru Rep Vol III p 33, No 10, and Plate, Ep Ind Toi I p 396, No 30, an] Plate The symbol generally has the same form as that in No 8, but its lower part is a little more cursive Oanningham and Bühler read it as 40 
(11) Mathurá inscription of the time of manasija Huvisbka, Asch Surv Rep Vol III p 34, No 15, and Plate The symbol is the same as in No 8 Cunmugham. read it as 40, and I bare followed him in my treatment of the record in the Ind Ant Yol XXXIII P103, No 14 
(12) Mathuri insoription, Ep Ind Vol II p 204, No 20, and Plato, p 821, and Plate The upper part of the symbol 18 the same as in Nos 8-11, but its lower part 19 a distinct loop Buhler read the sign as 70 
(13) Mathuri inscription, Dp Ind. Vol I p 387, No 11, and Plate As Bīhler expressly states in footnote that the syrabol 11 a plain pta, it may have been so in the impression befors him In the photo-lithograph, however, it does not bear the slightest recemblance to that aigu, but looks exactly like the letter bacon Bühler read the symbol as 40 
(14) SAĞchi ingai iption of the time of mahiraja ripitur dija dévuputra Shahi Vasashka, Ep Ind Vol II P 369 f, and Plate The symbol found here has quite a peculiar shape. Provided that the vertacal standing behind it does not belong to it, bnt is part of the following sign for 8, 2t resembles the usual sign for 20 AS Auch it was read also at first by Buhler, but at Cunningham's suggestion he afterwards took it to be 70 The reading of the sign was then discussed at length by Dr Fleet in a paper in the Journ Boy As Soc 1903, p 326 ff, and he came to the conclusion that it was 20 But later on, when Mr Vincent Smith in 129 Darly History of Indira; p 238, had suggested that the synbol might be raad as 60, Dr Fleet admitted the possibility of this interpretation, see Journ Roy As Soc 1905, p 3872 
Leaving aside for the present the symbols found in the last three inscriptions, it appears that there are two symbols, the St. Andrew's cross and the pta, one of which mist represent 70 and the other 40 Now in the inscription which forme the subject of this paper the St Andrew's Cross cannot represent 40, as in that case the inscription would be dated in the year 44 12 the reign of a king whose name begins with Visu, whereas we know that from 38-60 Huyishka Was the reigning monarch in this part of the country Here, therefore, the St Andrew's cross must represent 70, and we must accordingly assign the same valme to the symbol also in the inscrip trong ennmerated above ander Nos. 1-7 We thus get the dates S. 72 for No. I, s. 74 for

And although unfortunately the text of the ingruiption contains nothing that would enable us to form 
positive opinion on the value of the symbol, we may safely desert that it cannot be 20, as we find this numbei expressed by the usual sign in the date of the day Lastly also the proposal to treat the symbol as 60 cannot be gaad to be coavincing, the sign that bes hitherto been read as 60 in the insciiptions of the Kushana periods certainly being entirely different I do not want to offer a new hypothesis In my opinion wa shall have to wait for fresh materais before we can hope to arrive at & satisfactory result in this question In how far the restoring of the king** name in opi inscription of S 74 18 influenced by this encertainty, will be shown below.

The characters are of the so-called archaic type of the Mathura 2230riptions, Bos especially the lettora das su and sha, and the subscript yo The language 18 the mixed Dalect The inscrip tion is not dated. It records yarious gifts of * Brahman of the Ségrave (Saigrava) gotra, the treasurer of suûmuin mahikshatrapa Sondisi For details I refer to the remarks below.

REMARKS. 1 As to tho reading of this name see the remarks below_2 Little is left of the pa, but the reading is ezertain Rastoro pushka. -3 The outlmes of the lettera 129 uda pånô drtimó are more or less touched up with panol, but the reading is perfectly certain. The reading silú is certain, although the letters are entiel, spoiled by being gone over with pencil. 
TRANSLATION By the treasural of the lord, the nahikslutrapa Somdása, & Brêhnad of the Śégrava (Satgv (2 t) gêtia, & tank, the vestuan tank of these twin tanks, & 1e8error, a grove, a pillar and this stone-slab (was caused to be inale) 
NOTES As regards the language, the most interesting form is imeishan Apparently in the dialect of Mathuri the genutaves plar of the pronoun were, as in Pálı, omdsan and imisan, and the Author of the inscription translated the latter form into vishain As he was wont to ronder indsain by myslidin The nominative sing maso of the game pronoun is found at the end of line 2, but unfortanately nothing 18 left of it baš the initial i The word pushkarani shows in the third syllable the vocalisation of the Pålt pokkharani Yamada corresponds to Skt yamala or yanıla, as the word would be written in Southera manuscripts The constraction of the inscrip. tion 18 rather peculiar, the verb or parbiciple on which the instrumentals ordhmanina, eto., depend, being obutted 
The first point to command abtention is the name of the mahakshatrapa, which 18 generally supposed to be Šodása. In the progent inscription there 18 & distinct siga above the so It must have been found also in the wapressions used by Dowson and Canninghan, as the former reads Bundusabya (tor Simdhsadya) and the latter Saudisdeya (for Saud doadyo), although the fa081 milos show no trace whatever of arusvitra or at The siga cannot be the stroke denotang au, as it does not touch the upper line of the so, but is separated from it by a distinct blank space It can only bo au anusvdra of the 82 ze balky shape as that in ganjavaréna and in pushkaranînat. 
The forma Somdása has not yet been recognised anywhere else. In the second Brahmi inscription at Mathurd weationing this mahttshatrapal Buhler read Soddsasa, but the photo lithograph by no means exoludes the reading Sonddoada. Right above the so there is a white apot scarcely lesy distiaot than that above the ma of hámartamdat which Bühler read & gitzsutra. Ia the Mathara 110R-Capital inscription Mr Thomans teada the name as Sudassaad Sudia, and with regard to coins, Professor Rapson has stated in the Journ. Roy As Soc 1903, p. 289, note 3, that whenever the name is legible, the first akshara seems to be to, and that the alternative forms Su and Sau“, given by Bhagyanlal and Canningham respectively, cannot be

In October 1894 I received from Professor Hultzsch two impiessions of the insomption, prepared by Mi A Corsens, Saparintendent of the Archwological Survey of India, Western Circle, and an excellent photographs of it, tałcen by the same gentleman, was given to me two oL three years afterward, by Di Ficet From these materials I have already published a short &GConnt of the contents of the inscription and the tentative text of pine Velsos of it, in the Nachrtoliten der K Ges der W218612&chaften zu Gottingen for 1901, Part I, p 519 ff A lepeated examination of the some materials now enables me to place befoie the leader, wita come cond dence, by far the greater part of this record, which, though troublesome to read, is not so zl)ogible Bå at may have seemed to be on the original stone 
The inscription contains 38 lines of writing which coveis a space of about 2 feet bioad by 2 feet 7 inches hig! It has certainly suffered greatly from exposuic to the weather, especially in the middle and at the end of the lines all the way down, and for nearly the whole length of the last seven lines Bat fortunately all propei names of importance may be 1 tad with absolate certainty, at any rate all those that occul in lives 1–31, and the same remark: applies to the date of the ingcription at the end of line 31.

The inscription consists of two parts The first (and chief) part comprises lunes 1.-31. the second linen 31.39 
-38 This second part appears to be leal 
This second part appears to be really a separata inscription, added by way of postscript, whlok may record the inatallation of an mage of Vishnu, but the exact pui pore of which, owing to the damaged coasution of lines 33-38, I have not been able to ascertain. What I may state with confidence is that, after the words om namngh at the condencernent of line 32 there are five yerses, two in the Sragdhari metie, one in the Vasantatzlaki metre, one in the Upajátí metre, and the 6fth per baps in the gane metre So far as I can judge, tho first and piobably the second of these five verses contain some historical informastion, and it would therefore gepm desvable to have a chat taken of this part of the ingorption, which would enable one to decipher more of the text than I have succeeded in making out from the impressions and the photograph

Here we not merely have, at the end of eacl half verse, the synonymous words ábharana bhashita and alankaranabhasketa, exther of them gularly used in a double meaning, but we algo find a form of the same perb drosyante and dad725é) in kotly the same position 10 both Vorges. At the same time the manner in which the verge of the Sus updlavadha commences. Olearly shows how yo ought to interpret the first half of Earsha's verse the ornaments with which the enemies were decorated consisted a tho wounds inflicted on them when their loabs Were cut to pieces. I am a spare that what I have pintad out here is not of any great value How, because we hava lately learnt from another inscription that Magha lived long before the middle of the 9th century A D 
Among the contenta of the prafastt there are three points of particular interest The first obviously ig, that the insonuption is on the only one bitberto discovered of & Rishtrakata 
king Parabala, for whom at farnukes a date in A D 861. The ancond point 18, that Parabala'a rather Karkaraja defeated, and invaded the territory of, a kang Nagávalók! And to those Way be added the statement that an unnamed elder brother of Karkardja's father Jojje, sftor defeating certain Karnatas, took posadsgion of the Lita langdom 
As regards the first point, we knew indiped from the Tory earliest Sanskint insoription brought to the notice of European scholars -- the Mangir plate of Dévapal4l translated by Sir Uharles Willang m 1781 -- that the Pala king Dharmapala markied“ wanna deyi, Adaughter of the glorious Parabela, the ornament of the Risktrakuta famıly, but as the name Parabala Could not be traced in any subsequont inscription, scholars conjectured that it W88 & Uituda of one of the Rashtrakatas of Malkhêd, perhaps of Goviadorija III or Amoghavarsha I, accord ing to the notions which they had formed ragarding the time of Dharmapala. Now thera oan not remain any reasonable doubt that the Rashtrakita Parabalı of our Pathiri inscnpton 18 idontical with the Parabala of the Mungu plata, a daughter of whom was marked by Dhar mapala Bat it does not follow that Dharmapila's reiga must therofore be taken to have com menced so late as the middle of the 9th century Many Indian kings have had wasally long raigns, and at prsnant we know nothing about the longth of Parabala's reigu, while all that we know for certain in tłus respect regarding Dharnapen& 1s that he reigaed for at least 32 years The zeal and achyty displayed by the oficials of the Archeological Survey in the search for epigraplical documents encourage as to hope that baforo long we shall be in possession of materials that will definitely fix both the exact time of Dharmapala's reiga and the chronology of events generally which took place in Northern India during the 8th and 9th contumet. 
The king Nägivaldkawho was defeated by Parabala's father Karkardja seems to hayo beon a rılar of some importance. I have no doabt that he 18 identical with that Nigåvaldkę who is ventioned 12 yerse 13 of the Haraba ingcmption of Vigsbergja, in terms which would imply that he was the overlord, and who certainly was se contemporary, of the Chahamize Guvska I of Sakambhari, whom in my Synchroniato Table for Northern India I have roughly placed at the commencoment of the 9th century. There has lately been discovered a copper-plate indorip tion of a Chihamina Mahdidmantadhipatt, which records - grant that w88 muude at Bhfign kachchha in the inoreasing reign of victory of the glorious Nagávalóka and which apparently is dated in the Vibrama 7 vear 813 (correspondia to about A D 756). I owe a photograph of it to the kindness of Mr Gaurishankar Hiraoband Ojha, but would wait for impressions before expressing an opinion regarding its genuineness and valna

Nor dan I say anything definite at present regarding the conquest of the Låta kingdom by the elder brother of Parabala's grandfather Jeja The knowo dames of chiefs connected with Lata from about the middle of the 8th century and the available dates will be found above Vol VIII App II p. It will be seen there that we have no date, and know little aboat Låta, between A D 757 and A.D 812, which is just the period in which, judging from the date 
of the present inscription, we should have to place Jéjja and his elder brother. 
In the text which follows I have indicated by marks of interrogation all passages about which I am myself doubtfa), and have left blanks where I could have put in only a parely conjectural reading Others may be able to supply wbat 18 Wanting or to find the correct readings where I have failed to do so I know that I have shanned no trouble and may porhan be permitted to say

BY TII! LATE PROFESSOR F KIELHORN, OIE , GOTTINGEN These plates were sent in May 1893 by the Deputy Commissioner of Balaghat, & district in the Nagpur Division of the Central Provinces, to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, to which they now belong In the letter which accompanied them, it W88 stated that they had been found in the district, ' some time ago, hanging to a trse in the jungle? They were enti usted to me by Dr Hoernle in 1905, with the request that I should edit the insoription which is engraved on then Other work has prevented my doing so before DOW 
The plates are five in number, each between 6 and 6%" long by between 33" and 4' high, two of thom contain no writing whatover, while of the three others (hora descuibed as plates 1, 11 and 11) the second 18 engraved on both sides and the first and the third on one side only 
Though the plates have no raised rims and are not fashioned thicker near the edges, the engray. ing on thema 15 throughout in a perfeot state of preservation The five plates are strong on a ring, which passes through a hole about the distant from the middle of the proper right margin of each plate This ring 18 orronlar, about thick and betwoek 34 and 3" in diameter The ends of it are flattened off and joined by a bolt, which had not boon cat when the places came into my hands on the ring desoribed there slides a smaller ring, made of s band of copper, the ends of which are fastened by a rivet whoh also passes through, and Armly holds, a flat disc of copper about 29" in diameter: Undoubtedly this dis was meant to serve as a seal and to bear some writing, but nothing has been engraved on it & 
The plates clearly wore intended to record a grant of the Vakataka king Prithivishena II , but they actually give only the genealogy of the king and break off at the point where hue order

BY THE LATE PROFesgor F KIELEORN, OI.E., GOTTIXOEN There is no information as to where or when these plates were first obtained. In 1887 they belonged to Mr O T Metcalfe, Commissioner of the Omega Divison, and the ingeription which is engraved on thom was pablished in that year, with a facsimile, by the late Dr. Rajendralal Mitrs, in the Journ As Bat. Beng, Vol LVI Part I. p. 154 ft In November 1895 the plates were presented by the Commiasioner of Omase, through Mr O L Griesbaob, to the Asiatio Society of Bengal, and they have now been entrusted to me by Dr Hoernle, with the request to re-edit the inscription.

The grant now recorded on these platen 18 engraved on the second side of the first plato and on both sides of the two others file engraviug 18 deop and well done, and in a perfect state of preservation. In three places (in lines 10, 22 and 35) there is some doubt about the actual wording of the text, either because the engraver altered what he had originally engraved, or because portions of the letters of the earlier grant spoken of above are mixed up with the new Writing, the rest may be read without any diffoulty The size of the letters 18 abort The characters belong to that variety of the northern alphabet which we fiod, eg on the Bagoda plates of MACHAyavarman, treated of above, Vol FII p 101 f Of the consonant augns tho moat characteristic are those Eor 27 (eg. in Harusya Sdshahér:, 1 )and tf (eg 20 prikala-, 19, and -ughafft, 1 6), and n (eg 1-na-prina, 1 l), of whiob the last, in combination Mith palatala, also serves for the palatal nasal (eg in Bhaijamala, 1 14, =uktañscha, 1. 27, and 1dnohhitan, 1. 35), among other conjuncts attention may be drawn to the gas for kish, 49, gbh,

The inscription is one of the devont worslupper of Mahbávara(Siya), the ornament of the spotless family of the Bhanja8, the Mahardja Vidyadharabhañjedôve, also called king Dharmakalaba (P), who was a son of Šildbbañjadêva, grandson of Digbharjadeva, and great-grandson of Rapabhatjadeva; and its object is to record & grant which was igared by tho kang from Vañjalvake$ Like the Gamgir grant of Nêtribhaõjadêya Kalyanakalaga, it opens with two verses which glorify the (third) eye of Hara (Siva) and invoke the protection of the waves of the divine Gaaga.

The inscription (10 lines 35-38) ends with four statements, introduced severally by the participles Lafonhitam, pravésttam, lekhitam; and utkirnu About the meaning of the last there can be no doubt the grant was wrtten by the sandhuvigrahrka (or mydislor OT podoo and war) Kharabha, and opgraved by the akshasálag (ox goldamath) Kumârachandra The term pravdfutam I have not found in elmilar sarroandings m any other grant, bot #2003 thua word takes the place here of the phrase svayam-ddishtô rajña dútakóxtra of the Gumsur grant of Netibhañja and of the earlier grant on these very platest (where that phrase u Both Cases appear in company with Idñchhitam, lrkhatam and utkirman), I thunk that it zums& likewise be taken to refer to the business of the databa and that the words pravésitait Klastic must be translated brought to the donee's) kome by the messenger) KéśavaThe pagkage commencng with lafchhatam I am nnable to explain properly. According to Dr Flooty above, Vol VII p. 227, Lafichhana denotes the device used on the seals of copper-plata charterby stao, and Jáfichhta therefore probably means · furnished with such a device' or 'marked with I soal' (mudraya mudritam). We find the word in the Baguda plates of Midh payirmany above, Vol. IIL P 46, 1. 50, lánohitom Jayasinghêna, in the Ganjam plates of Prithiyipar madera, sbove, Vol IV P 201, L. 35, ldnachhatana-cha śri-mü(ma)hádéryú, m the grant which was originally engraved on these plates, above, p 272, láñchistam [rályri-szi-Afdnikya mahadevya, marked with & sal by the queen, the glorious Manikya-mahadevi,' and it care also in the Gamsar grant of Nátribhanja, where the words by which it is followed cannot be made out with confidence. In the prefent case our text appears to give us lañchhatan #6 Trikahiga-makadéryd, 'marked with a soal by the glorious Tnkalinga-mahadàvi," which would be similar to what we find in the earlier grant on these plates, but those words and followed by t&adiking, which may be corrupt and the meaning of which is quite obscure, and after that again we have the instrumental fribhafta-Stambhadeva-mantrınd, by the minister, the bhaffa Stambhadora which, for want of the meaning of the obscure word, I see no way of connecting with what precedes. It 18 curious that in at least two of the pasgages where the word lisoh Mtazu oocars the marking with the seal 18 stated to have been performed by & queen. 
Our inakription contains no date of any kind, and for the present it seems impossible to fix its age over approximately, because we know nothing that in certain about the chiefs of the Bhafijs family daring the Middle Ages, and possess no dated macríptaons with the same alphabet With all dus reserye I would say that the inscription may perhaps be assigned to the 12th or 19th century A.D

Verge 4 of our inscription tells us that Kakkuka erected two columns, one at Rohitaka and the other at Maddodara. Exactly the same zuformation is couveyed by Verse 21 of the Mata-ki-gül record, excepting that for Roburngaka we have there Robimsakupa. Rəhimsaka 18 andonbtedly the same as this Rohimgakupa or the Robineak pake of our inscription No 2, and is to be identified with Ghatiyaļå. Maddodars, it can scarcely be seriously doubted, in Mapdôr, five mules north of Jodhpur, which 6 locally believed to have been a seat of Prathara power and is full of very apcient rains, and where s fragment of .

The very same thing is alladed to in perse 20 of the Mita-ki-sål record. The ideoription really enda here so far as the parport of it is concerned, but a verse follows which has something of the okaraoter of a subhashita. Its chief interest, however, lies in the fact that it was composed by Sri-Kakkuka himself, as the line in prose at the end informs us

No. 39.-SARANGARH COPPER PLATES OF MAHA-SUDEVA. 
BI HIBA LAL, B.A., NAGPUR. Sarangarh is the capital of a fondatory State of the same name in the Chhattisgarh digi Blon of the Central Provinces, 32 miles south of Raigarh, the capital of another State and a station on the Bangal-Nagpar Railway. The chiefs of these two States are RAJ-Gbpde The platou in question are in the possession of the Rij family and first came to my notice in the begi ang of the year 1903 et my last visit to Barangarh As they were looked up and the keys were not available at the time, the then Saporintendent of the State, Rai Sahib Alam Chand, prom 1sed to a nd them to me when I asked for them, brut my reversion to the executive daties bofore I could retarn to head-quarters, followed by Pandit Alam Chand's retirement from service, left them where they were, autil the present Superintendent Manshi Akbar Khid, took Sotive steps in the matter at the instance of Rai Bahadur Pandi Baijnath, B A., Diwan of the Bastar State, and dont them on to be on the 7th January 1908 Thus the recovery of the plates first discovered over forty years ago 18 88 maoh due to the interest of the above gentleman as to the readiness of Raja Jawihar Singh to lend them for examination. 
The exact date and the details of the first discovery are not now forthcoming, bat the platen am said to have reached the Bangal Agiatic Society on the 17th December 18646 Dr Rajendra Lal Mitca published them in that Society's Journal in 1866, where he stated that they were presented to the Society by Inattenant G. Bowie of the Sambalpar Police Corps, but when Dr. Klaot wrote his Grapta inaoriptions about 1888, and searched for the platas, he could not

find them. He then recorded that as the published version was not suficiently reliable in . reproduced he was unable to isolade this isoription in his volume 2 
The fact appears to be that the plates were never presented to the Society. Thar 
Ley were simply lent by and finally returned to the owner, the Sårangarh family, whose State ve those days included in the Sambalpur district, now transforred to Bengal 
These facts combined with the absence of a facsimile oopy of the record in Dr Edendra Lal's notice, together with certain misreadings of the text, afford, I venture to think, safficient reasons for 14-editing this inscription. 
There are two copper plates, each measuring 61** 3$", and the weight of the two together 18 1% oza, 51 drs Aboat 1" from the proper right margin each plato has a hole, roandish on one side and squarsh on the other, the diameter being about yly". Thebe wore intended for stringing the plates on the ring, the loss of which has deprived our inscription of its last por tion, which must have been engraved on & third plats, The lost plate must have contained about 5 or 6 lines which can almost be restored from other insoriptions of the game king, and of Maha-Jayarůda, all of which are composed in exactly the same wordings, the names of villages granted and the dondes being of course different. In oor inscription only some of the impreca tory verses are lost as also the date at the end, which of course cannot be restored. Judgiøg from other indoriptions of the king the date must have been in zegral years, so that it could not have been of much help beyond fixing the priority or otherwise of our inscription as compared with others. 
The plates recovered are in an excellent state of preservation One is inscribed on one ezde and the other on both in characters of the box-headed variety of tine Central Indian alphabet The letters are very neatly and well formed, their average size being about my The accompanying plate gives & facsimile copy, from impressions kindly taken for ma by M T G. Green, Saperintendent of the Government Presa, Nagpar. 
The language in Sanskrit probe except the usual improcatory Verabs, here attribnted to Vykos As regards orthography, there is very little to be notiond beyond what has been already done by Dr Konow with regard to another inscription of the same king repently found at Kharlar,' As the composition is almost identical, the peoalarities are common to both. The wpadhminiya oocars in line 321 ogradalsparanar, The same siga, via, 2 dots, has been used for vísarga and a pause. Ordinarily matris for #, ri and Li alone ate attached at the foot of lottory, but in this inscription there is a opra8 Aramplo in line 12 where the siga for & 12 anumõditah 18 partly exhibited by a top and partly by a foot stroko, all other d'o being copredented by the top strokes for å anda, compare vikkramöpanata of line 1. 
Tho Decription Wag leaned from the town of Sarabhapara and records the grant of & village named Chullandaraks situated in the bhukts or subdivision of Tundbraka by the Queen and the royal family of Baja Mahl-Suddra and assented to by bim, to a number of learned prieste, vk Bhdskaras vámi, Prabhakarasyêu, Barbbarisyimi, Botasvimi, Dattaspåmı, Vishnusvåmı, Phalgnevam, SydmikirltaavAmi and Bathkarasvami, all of the Kausika gátra. One of these, Vishpagydmais is apparently adentioal with the dove of tho Khuruar platos.

SARANGARE COPPER PLATES OF MAHA-SUDEVA. 
Isha Dr Konow has conjectured that tho Sarabhapara kuga might have been Rashtrakatas 
reageendant in the Central Provinces about the Sth century to which period the charao We of our Imboription belong. But Dr Konow, for reasons pointed oat by him, regards the ideatrication as yet very doubtful. 
of the geographical damo ocourriøg in the inscription Sarabhapura, which recars 
other ivo granta of Mahl-Sudera, and in the Arang plates of Mand-Jayaraja, hag not on hoon vientified. I identify Tupdarake with the present Tandrå, about 6 miles south 
Sonu Niidyan on the Mahinadi and about 85 miles west of Sarangarh It is now wunded in the BalddA Bazár tahşil of the Raipur district The village Chullandaraka manat hare been somewhere olose to fundid, but I am at present unable to trace 16 If it Tata wo would now find the name in a forga like Cbnlåndar, a characteristic Chattisgarhi wame some similar ones which I remember being Machåndır, Palândur, Kachåndur, eto it apuests to me that another village granted by Mahd-Saddva in bis Raapur obarter we Dot very far away from Tandr.. It is called Srisahaka, wbich I take to be the present Sirsibl, alao poluded in the Balod& Bazar tahsil, and situated about 25 miles south-west of Tangri. Maha-Jayardja of the Arang plates, who belonged to the same dynasty, also seems to have granted & Tillage in the same part of wis kingdom, vw Pamvå,* which I identify with Pamgarh, about 21 miles north of Tandrd and included in the Janjgir ta hell of the Bildspar district. Pachys and Srisabiks are stated to be inoluded in the Pertarishtra or Eastera coantry, and we know from the Khanar plates that to the south the kingdom extended at least up to Kuartar. This leads to the unference that the territories of Wah-Sudere included a large portion of Mahs-Koala, or roughly speaking Chattisgarh division.

found in the Nepal inscription of the year 3168 (c) The presence of the aouta angle is noticoable only in the dental sa and ma, as is sur 
the case in the Muņdddvari inscription But nomo lettere show a well-definent anito angle at their lower extremities in alternativo cabe, of the dham »hårddhigama (1. 5) with that in -didhita 13.1. B, And yrıhadbhogikddhikarandrya

as the lingual na in the latter 1 Oractly similar to the pa of the early Gupta type 
while tbo pa in oar grant has larger space heirson the right and left oorges. (e) The characters of this grant show a greater afinity to the Gomagbitol inscription of 
the Gopta year 316 than to the coptomporary Nopal insoriptions. The paleography of the epoch beginning with the last kalt of the 6th and ending with the first half of the 7th century A.D. can nowhere be radied with greater advantage than in Nepal. The decriptions of the Hargha your 84, the Gupta year 816, the Harsha Yoare 39 and 45 shopy very olarly the obadge which came over later Gupta characters in the last half of the 6th contary and the 80 yours following that. Thus the Golmdahutal inscription of the year 318 shown in its obaracters very little departure from those of the Mandador inscription of Yaddharman. The Patan insorption of the year 846 exbabita a fartbør step onwarde, as it is more allied to the Gañjim grant of Salatka than our great or the Golmsquitol inscription. The next inscription, that of the Haryba your 896 mnd the short record of the year 45 of the same era, are insorbed in character which are very minah akin to the Badk Gavå 108orintion of Muhandman and the Madhuban and Banathêrs grants of 
Harshavardhana (1) The letters da and ta rosemble such other vory closely. Then, wythadbhagtheddhis

Br R. D BANERJI This isoription was discovered Axong the debris which had soogmulated argund the tample of Munddéværi la tko Bhåbud aubdivision of the Shahabid district? It seems that some time after the incluida of the 20scription sono ignorant person sawed it lengthwise in halves, the two halves of the 19hoription were discovered and brought to the Indian Masoom at diffen ent dates The second half sooms to have been discovered by the late Babu Purna Chandra Mikhôtii 80 far back as 1891-2 The first half, which is the more important part of the in somption, as it contains the data, w discovered in 1902 Impressions on tin foila were thera gent to Dr Bloch The inscription was fically brought to the Indian Museum in the begioning of 1904 The two halves have now been joined together and placed on & masonry pedestal 11 the Insorption gallery of the Maboum 
The stone measures 984 by l' l' and contains orgłatesa ligos of well executed writing 1.1 the first half of the loccription the first fifteen lines are clear, but the guxteenth lae has been much damaged and the soventeenth and eighteenth lines have been lost altogether With the exception of the last two linos, which contain one of the usual improcatory versea, the whole of the inscription is it probe. 
In a provious paper I have fully discussed the palæography of this inscription: The only orthographical pecaliarities are the substitution of ba for va 20 sambateard, and the use of # instead of m beforo f.

Br T BLOOE, PE D. The stone bearing this insorption was discovered by Rakhel Des Baneri in April, 1908, 13 the Laoknow Museum As Dr Vogel tells me, it is the rod andstone #lab, 3' 1" high, 11*** wide, and 4" thick " It is broken off at the top, junt where the octagonal portion begins Here the four corners are provided with an ornament in the Mathar, stylo. The lower portion of the slab is carved with a seated female figure, apparently untidisbed, The back of the column 18 cut off straight." The photograph of the stone, aupplied to me by Dr. Vogel, shows that this carying has been done at a later time, perhape when the song was intended to be used for some building It has destroyed a good many letters in the Bacond half of the insoription, while the first half has become almost entirely obliterated by sharpening knives on it.

TWO BUDDHIST INSCRIPTIONS FROM SARNATH 
291 
Vahat, which has beon edited by me, above, Vol VIII pp 180-181 This fact 18 of con 
Me interest. First it shows that I was right in explaining the word diindas-cha in in the Sahet Mahêt imago insorption as "& staff for supporting the unibrella over the head 
Rochisattva" (top 180) Secondly, and this is by far the most important point 
sted with this insoriptio,m we now know for certain that the Sahét Mahet statue was God by Cunninghan. 8406, or, in other words, that no possible doubt can be raised found by WU* 
he correctness of Cunningham's identification of Sahét Mahot with Srivasti. Toi 900108t the correu 
thong the Thoorde of tho Lookuow Mugeun aro not is clear as one woald have expected them 
la revard to the provonance of the stone, Dr Vogel has pointed out to me some very 
insiye evidence, which in my opinion makes it certain that the stone was found by Dr Tar drining his excavations at Sabbt Mobótin 1885 The only possible doubt that could be, and how heen raised brainst the bearing of the Sahet Malet, now Calcutta Mubaum, status upon the omaation of the identity of Sabot Maldt with Srivasti, tarned around this point did Cunningham find the Bodhisattva imago at Sahot Mahot ia its original position, or had it been shifted to this plece from aomewhero cleo? Strange though such a transportation would appear to na primit facie, at still has been, as far as I know, ku assumption that seemed to recommend itself to certain scholars. I ara afraid their position has now become definitely weakened by the discoveries above referred to. 
Unfortunately no farther help 18 given to us by the now inscription for restoring the maging words in the beginning of the lusorption on the podestal of the Bodhisattva statuo 13 the Caloutta Museum. Ouly tho two lotters vaput in the beginning of line 2 show that I was right in testoring the second word in the culcatta inscription & Akvaputrasya, and further in agribing the Caloutta statue to tho time of either Kanushka or Huvishka However, this 18 vory small matter, for wbioh bardly any additional proof was required owing to the occurrenco of the name of the Trepitaka Bala, the donor of the Caloutta imago, 10 & Mathura macription of the year 33 of Haviebla ?

In Jane 1908, Pandit Makund Rám, wbo ked with great courtesy kuun plaoud at my du posal by the Kashmir Darbar, was informed by a friend of tho exutuney of an inaonbod stono m the house of & Bráhirap in Årigom, and at my reqnext be font up to inspect at socording to information gathered by him on the spot, the stono in question was found about twelve years ago in a piece of uncultivated land near the Masjid Malik Sahib by & oultivator, who was digging there, and sold to a Brahmsy for sordo cora. The Brshmad kept thu utonu for some timo and did půzú to it Bat poople who say it, told him that the writing probably contained information about hidden treasure, and that the stone therefore properly bolonged to the Maharaja He got frightened, and first hid the stono under the wall of his house, but later on he threw it into & pit at the entrance of his gôtúld and covered it up with cow.dang Papdit Mokand R&m fartkor informs me that images, pedeatala, stones and broks are found all ovor tho placo, and it is pro bable that excavations wonld yield interesting results

Thu Slaba must be identical witka Jayasimha (from A D 1128), 2 whose reign Hådigráma was burnt down by Sujjl? It then becomes highly probable that the vardya Ulhna is ideatioal with Ulhada, the son of Sahadøra, who was & supporter of Bujj* Sahadeva Is desorbed as Adjaputra, which fact cao. of course be well reconoiled with his son Ulhana's boing a vardya Tho constructor of the brick vahüra Was Ramadêve, whom I cannot dentify.

The word ozur. 18 osed with more than one meaning In our inscription, however, there Carizgot be much loubt that it signifies a shrine, as it has been characterized as " the abode of Lokandtba." The stone upon which this epigraph has been incued 15 most probably the actual base of the statue of Lôkanátha here alluded to Lokanatha is, of course, idential with Avalokitekvara, who is invoked up lines 1-2 Our 108cription thus furnishes Talaable proof of the fact that Buddhism was still lingering in Kashmir in the 12th and 13th centuries

The inscription then goes on an probe, stating That the yiotonous king Chandradeva isodes the following order to all the people abaenibled, randing in the Vadagava-village in the Vivana-pattald, and also to the Rijas, Rdghis, Yuvarijas, mapallore, obaplains, warders of the gato, generals, trekgurers, keepers of records, physicians, astrologere, superintendents of gynæceans, messengers, the oflicers in charge of elephants, horses, towns, mines, sthanas and gókulas 
«Be it known to you that the aforesaid village, with ate water and dry land, with its mines of iron and salt, with its fishing places, with its rapides aud saline soll, with and includıg sta groves of madlıdta and margo, gruas and pastare land, with what is above and below, de fined as to sta foar abattals, up to its proper boundaries, has today, on the

The brat point here that is worthy of notice ie the date, which is the sarliest known for Chandraddva, the other copper plato of his time boing dated in Samyat 1154% It will be seen that the portion of it containing the tithi and the work day is illegible. Mr Chhote Lal, who has examined the orginal, writed about this porate 
"Ordinarily, it might be thought that the croorgTe corrosion and inoristatuon of rust at this particular part of the plate was purely bocidental, but from a minute exammation of the imperfect and damaged letters which are still discernible, I am led to copalude that the exces alye incrustation at this point was due to the fact that the surface of the plata was already damaged by somebody in his ondeavour to make a comection in the side It is radarkable that the name of the place or that of the stream in which the donor took hur bath, is not mentioned in the insoripton. Nor is there any mention of the open on (eclipsá, soukrántí, eta ) at which the gilt was made. It would appear that Saari-Nariyana was in those days a very well-known place of pilgrimage requiring no farther detalle to localigo it that the occan groumably was the ordinary Karttika-endna, and that the date originally entered on the plato was patchadaiyan gural, but wad afterwards attempted to be corrected into skidaiyah ranat, The & of the latter just overlaps tihe part of the former; the kd of the latter being rather large has been so formad this to include the cha and to cover the space occupied by da of the formør; while the space oscupied by by&st of the former has been utilised for the rather olammly largo da of the lattor, It will thun be seen that the space originally coupied by the word panchadadydik, which was of normal size, was mabsequently occupied by the mnoh larger lattor, d, kd and da, and there being no more spuOS available for the final syllablo by&sh, id was omitted.

I say all this may have been the cause of the alloration in the date, for there 18 no a priore magna against thra soppositiou But I consider it very unlikely that a Mab&rija, who changed hxx mind about the sotaal day of performing & religious coromony, could have allowed a correction and a clumsy correction at the best to be made in the cripper plate inscription recording the gift of a whole village, when the entire coscription could have boon ont on a new plata in & dap's tamo. The fact seems to be that it 28 no honour to R Brahmap to nocuire Bu gilt on the occasion of an eclipse, and there are certain soots of Beth BDR, f. Sarja poris and Kanaaplyad, who would promptly excommunicato any member of their community who was known to heya rocarved cult on account of so polipse The Brábmap who ruceived the manificent ft from Chandradéya probably belonged to one of these boots, and, kfter the kiog had made the gift and departad, he sooms to have thought of conosaliag hu disgracefal coaduot and to have caused the orginal and gequine date to be altered as explained above." 
Mr. Chhote Lal further identißes Vadagava with the prowad Barugaon, a village 14 miles north west of Benarbe Ho tbunka it, however, Albo pokuhlo that it was the old name of Chandrápati, which was afterwards changed in houoar of king Chandrdevk. 
After the mention of the grant, we find some of the annal ima proputory verses, and, at the end, the name of the wntor, tho thalskura Mahapanda.

BURBANPUR SANSKRIT INSCRIPTION OF ADIL SHAH

The cbret interest of our inscription lies in the genealogy of the Faruqis given in it. Anording to at the first king was Rija Malik, whoso soa Was Ghazni (KL&n). His son was Kaisar Khan, whose Aon WAB Hasan, from whom was born Adil shab, whose son was Mubårakh. Adil Shak, the constructor of the mosque, was the son of the Mubarakh This venealogy differs from those given by Firishta and Abul Fazi. According to the former Adil Shah was the 6th descendant from Malik Rája, and according to the latter the 8th, while socording to onr 10sorption he was the 7th. The tables given below will show at a glance how matters stand

The dinos-Akbari states that " Bahadur Khin (who was the son of R&ja Ali Khan) was 9th in descent from Malik Rajz." Thu has led Colonel Jarrett, so it would indeed lead others, to suppose tbat the list given there is genealogical and that Ahsan Khön, the fifth king, was identical with Hasan Khan, who, es a matter of fact, was Depor a king Hasan Khda belonged to & collateral branch of the famuly, whose son became kng on the failure of male issue in the main line. 
The Ain-4-Akbart has mixed up the succession list with the genealogical table. Miran Shah, the third desoendant, Wae wally a grandeon of Malik Raja, but the point missed 1d that he was not the direct escendant of the last Ådil Sh8h or Raja Ali Khan. The orown first went in Mirau Shah's line up to 4dil Shah Aydd, who was succeeded by his brother D&wid Khan, and the latter by his son Gbagni Khan, who was poisoned two days after sscending the throne Abul Fazl does not mentioa Ghazal Khan at all, probably because his snovegaon to the throne was only zommal Ghaint Khan left no son, and hence the crowd went to Raja Ali Khan's grand father Adil Shah or Adil Khan. T'he three kings Miran Shah, Mubarak Shah and Adil Shah Ayal were not thas direct ascendants of Raja Al Khin The Ain-t-Akbart list should there fore be left out of consideration, and the question must be dooided between oar msonption and Firushta's liet Briggs& takes Hagan to be the son of Nasir Khøn, relying on hirshta's Assortion that" Adil was the son of Hased and grandson of Nasir Khan" If Hagan were the son of Nasir Khán, he would be the brother of Miran Shah, who was crowned king after his father's death. We would, therefore, have to suppose that Miran's nephew came to the throne after the expiry of three

MRAS, NAGPOR. pantvanpål 18 a villago 23 miles north-west of Jagdalpur, the capital of the Bastar fexdatory atate attached to the Chhattisgarh Division of the Central Provinces It is situated on tho motut bank of the “ splendidly picturesque" Indrivati, one of those minor rivers of India than which none is more interosting. It “ traverses the most antroddan regions of the peninsula Here in the deepest recesses of the wild forests which covor the Mardian hills, is the home of the Gönd racegom. One of the aborigmal Dravidian peoples, whose origin 18 indistinct, a people who stall ereot mudé stone monuments and use stone implements, unwitting of the procession of the centuries and the advance of civilization to their borders" And yet the very place which has today all the signs of a primoval forest, may a thousand years back have oompared favourabiy with any of the olvilized provinces of those timea At least sich seems to be the irresistible conolasıon from tho discovery of the antiquarian remains left by the forgotten Nigavainsi kings of that little known statp. Nåriyanpål is one of those places which enjoyed celebrity in their tines, a place to which people of various countries resorted," and whuck instead of having a long row of wooden pegs gods, which now adoin the village turf, possessed the temple of Narayana, “the basket of the gems of knowledge which no doubt the roeidents duly picked up The Indrivati was to Bastar what the Narmada has been to India, the separating boundary between the Aryan and the Dravidian peoples. It is therefore no surprise to find all the in soruptions to the north of the Iudriyati written in Nagari characters, while all to the south in writton in Telugu It appears that the Någayansi kinga, though ralog on both sides of the Indrivati, had fixed that river as the ethnic or at least tho linguistio boundary for the con yenience of the Aryan and the Dravidian peoplos under their away Our inscription boing found in Nártyanpål on the north bank of the river is therefore in Sanskrit characters Its dis coyery is due to the efforts of Rar Bahadar Pandi Bazjuåth, BA, who kindly sent me five in presalon. Another impression hau since been prepared by Mr Venkoba Rao of the Madres Aron wological Survey. I have made use of all these materials for my edition. The 108cmption is engraved on a stone slab, standing near the temple of Nirayana, to which it belongs In this temple there in still an oxquisite inage of Narayana, 2 high sbove the ground the slab measures 74" * 2' 3', and the writing covers & space 5' 9' X 9' 2", including the imprecatory figures and the additions to be referred to presently, bat leaving out the top Sri maht. The original inscription apparently contained only 35 lines, beginning with Svesta sarandra phandmanı and ending with mangala maht-ért, underneath which the usual improcatory figures of a cow and a calf, the dagger and shield, the sun and moon and the Siva linga, the meanings of wbioh I have elsewhere explained, were carved. The additional Il lines, marked (a), (b), (c) and (d) by me, appear to be later additions, and are either interpolations or wero insorted when the ownership of the land changed hands aither by succession or otherwise They generally give the names of persons to whom the land was apparently transferred. The lines marked (a), (b), (C) have been ingerted in the blank spaces between or on the sides of the impreostory figures Under all these a straight line has been drown, and the four lines marked (d) have been 20serted. These give the name of a queen different from the donor of the inscriptioa proper. This may have been done when the land obedged hands after the desth of the original donor, WLlen, in the ordinary course, the successor of the dozor pould be shown as the transferor or grantor

The donor waa Gunda Mahadorl, thuchu quyon of the Mah&riza Dhgråvarshe, the mother of Sômédvaradéra anri the gniumauthor of Kasharedéra, who was then ruling after the death of his father, as stated in line 17 Thu digilanty claims to be Nagavamist of the Kiśyapa gótya and to have a tiger with # call ak klien uront and to be the lords of Bhoråvati, the best of out108 There) 06n be little doubt that 1$ w*# ronnectnd with the Sinds family of Yelbarga Tho birudas of the two and #trikingly minitr The Sindas also olaim to be Nagavamsódbhava, born of tho race of the Någa (oubra), and the lord of Bhogevati, which city s & mythical place in the nether world.

As Dr Fleetl says, there appear to have beur more branches than one of the Sunda family, and it appears to me that they were distinguished from each other by soma variations 12 their orests (lasohhanos) and banners (dh rajar, paldkus or kitanus) Tho vydghra-ldfohha na (tiger-orest) seems to have been common to all, probably boomuse the original Bncestor of the dynasty włuch reusived its name after hizt, was bulipped to have been brought up by the king of serpents on tiger'a milk* The Bagalkot branch had sipaply the tiger orest and the pharma kétana, or banner of hooded sorporate The Bastar branch, or more properly the branch re presented by our inscription, had a wavatsa-oyaghra-kimchlussabt, or, tigur with a calf or chlag thus depleting probably the story of their ongin in a oloarur way. The banner is not mentioned. In Bastar there were apparently two branchua, the other one being that of Bhramarakotamana

Wel whose lanchhana was dhanur-vyúghra (bow and tiger) and whose dhraya was hamala 
el. or lotus flower and plantain leaf The Halavar branch of the Banvâsı tract had a gdghra-mriga-laachiana, or crest of a tager and a deer, and the niladhtaja, or blao banner. To go from their titles Paramétvara Paramabhatjárakı Mahtrája, the Bastar branch appears 
have been more independent than the other branches of this dynasty But more light 18 likely in the thrown on the bustory of the family when all the wscriptaons found in Bastar have been deciphered. It would thereforo be premature to disouss tho subject here. 
There is one phrase in this inscription, whioh to my mind appears to interesting that it should not be allowed to pasa unnoticed It 18 inoidentally mentioned in line 32 where the ind 18 said to be given gråmo-nılaya-nada-8arya-vådhd-parihirenti, which apparently means s free from the uuterforence of the dwelling-group and territorial assemblies, and all other mol estations. This throws # sidelight on the yıllage corumuuties of those days. With regard to mida, Mr Baden-Powell' gays, “ All over the south of India we have traces of the nddu, which Mas often & sort of county, and in aome places there ia & clearly surviving tradition of the par pose of this divis100 Thus in part of Madras known anorently as the Tondaimandalaw, we fad first & bomber of kutgang-the name probably indicating the fort which was the seat of the territorial chief, esch of these primitive territorios WAS afterwards reorganised into nidu and rok nder contained a number of villages (called nattam, 2e the pillage ste) The chief of the rod da was called ndithan. In Malabar we have evidence of how these nadu di YiBions were governed by the nida-kuffam or assembly of representative elders out of the family groups of tara, of the ruling class, in esch ndon " It appears from our insoription that this nada spatara was provalent in Bastar and the word nilaya apparently stands for tara, tihe original local term for the family aggregates of dwellings, conasting of the houses occupied by the members with a fost bumbler sbodes for servants and artizans" Tara is said to mean street or bamlet The grima or village was also recogalsed, bat apparently had no fiscal sigarficance, beyond being á plynoal aggregate of clan areas with an exotio popalation It will be notioed that Nåriyana para is deaoribed as fall of outsiders, who had come from different countries Theme apparentio contriba ted nothing to the income of the village, and in the business portion of the oharter (11 25 to 39) wa therefore find po mention of the pillage, but only of the land given The names of the owners of plots oocapied by the family groups kare been duly enamerated, and it is they who have been enjoined to pay the rents to the temple The transkotzon has been ratified by eight persona, which was probably considered a requisite number for such business. These pro bably formed the executivo committea of the ride-Suffam or terntorial Assembly As would appear from the insoription, it consisted of the pregadd or minister, the karana-kutttum or Seore tary of the eggembly, tha bhandari or trdasaror, the sidhu or prieat, and four Nayakas, who, as has been already showa, ware chiefs of nidas One of these niyakas styled bhattaniyaka, perhaps & supanor title to that of ordinary niyakas The montion of his name immediately Bfter that of tho minister indicates his superior positaon 
Our inscription mentiona only one territorial Dave, vaid the Nárayagapura village, which 2A certainly the present N&rlyaapal, where the 10somption has been found, and where the temple of Nariyapm, to which the village prag dedicated, still exiats. The tank Kharjuribandha, whuoh wag apparently named after the kharjüri or wild date trees on its beaks, is diffioult to Locate at this distange of tune, as these trees live for aboat fifty years only.

TIMMAPURAM PLATES OF VISHNUVARDHANA I

NO 50 -TIMMAPURAM PLATES OF VISHNUVARDHANA I VISEAMASIDDHI 
BY PROFESSOR E HOLTZSCE, PED , HALLE (SAALE) This short inscription 18 on three oopper-plates which weis « discovered in the ground in Ostobar 1907 by ono Sukarı Kamnsvamı while digging a bole in his pacuut house site in the village of Timmapuram in the Saryasiddhi talaka" and were sent by the Collector of the Vigagupatam distract to Rai Babadar Venkayya, who describes them as follows 
"The platos measure 21 hy 7 inches and are strong on an oval nng, the diameters of which de 24 and 3 inches The ends of the ring are secured in the base of the nearly circalar seal whrob measuIC betweon 14 and 1 inches in diametei In the centre of this seal 18 the legend {ifar]#fefe in the samo niphabet in which the plates themselves are engraved The third plate of the inscription is blank, and tho grant itself ends in line 2 of the second side of the second 
plate" 
The alphabet and orthography do not call for any special remarks The final tocours in line 1, the upadhmüniya in 1, 5, and the Dravidian letter la in1 11 The language in Sanskrit prose. The panegyrcal portion (11.1--11) 18 comparatively correct--probably because it was copied from a form prosoryod at the royal secretariat The grant portion, however, must have been drafted by a person who knew very little Sanskrit It contains a Pråkgt word cluattálisu ( 12) = Sansknt chutvurintat, and several grave grunmatical blanders which I have corrected in the footnotes. 
The mecription rucorde a grant by Vishnuvardhana-Mabgrija surnamed Viahamasiddhi, who was the younger brother of Satyasraya-Vallabha-Maharaja, the son of Kirtivarman, the grandson of Ranavikrama, and the great-grandson of Ranaråga of the Challu)kya fauly This short pedigrop ustablishes the identity of the donor of this grant with Vishnuvardhana I. Vishamgsiddhi, the fonnder of the eastern branch of the Chalakya dynasty That ne pas the yonnger brothor of Satyåsraya, ne the Western Chalukya kag Palakhsin II , and the son of Kirtivarman (I ), is stated w many Eastern Chalukya inscriptions, and his grandfather Ranayıkrana, ie Pulakesin I., 18 mentioned also in bis Såters plates & The reference to his great-grandfathor Rapariga is of some interest, bocause this name is knowo only from a few records of the Western Obelakyas 
Both Vishnuvardhana Iand his older brother receive the title Mahardja, but the second is stated to have subdued the orcle of the whole earth' (1 5f), while the former clazma only to have humbled the circle of all the yusgals' (1.6 £) This distinction implies that, at the time of this grant, Vusbpuvardhana I, was still a dependant of bis elder brother, the Westera Chalukya kang Palakėsi II He professed to be & worshipper of Bbagayat (1 10), & e, Vishạn, and readed at Piehtapura (1 1), the modern Pithapuram in the Goddvari district In the Aiboļe inscription. the capture of this fortress 18 &scribed to his elder brother and so velega Pulakesın II. 
The grant portion differs from that of other records in two respects It lacks at the end the tsual imprecations and other particulars, and the donacs are not mentioned by name, but sunply stated to have been forty Brdhrapas of the Ohhandöga school The object of the grant Was some land at Kumularna vilage which I am anable to identify in the Palaki-Vishaya.
