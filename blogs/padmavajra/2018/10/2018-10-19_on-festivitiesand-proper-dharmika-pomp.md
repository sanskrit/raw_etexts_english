-Aizawa Seishisai

The soul of the Hindu nation is built on reverence to the
rites(temples,yajñas,etc) and the public celebrations of our devatās.
These comprise our Hindu system,which is in absolute opposition to
systems from Abraham’s children(Christian,Islam,liberal,etc).

-John Gray

Indeed. They are living the myths of liberalism,to be precise. Or other
Christians/Muslims/other malicious parties using that adverse system to
bait Hindus. Hence they have endless lectures for Hindus on how
polluting/exploitative their festivities are(example:The dirt thrown on
Dahi handi celebrations when compared to human pyramid festivities in
Europe,or about polluting pandals). Or when they say about how
Diwali/pandals are endless pollutants compared to 4th of July/31st
December-1st January celebrations/fireworks celebrations of Bollywood
celebs which invite pindrop silence to happiness from them). And have to
make lots of unprincipled exceptions in their lines of arguments to
specially target us. They are all side tracks to the main issue that
these,as public expressions of reverence towards our devas,are matters
in which no compromise should be brooked. Let us turn to Seishisai again

Similar thing can be said about Vijayadashami/Dipavali/etc celebrations.
Celebrations in full dhārmika pomp and splendour,reinforcing the
prescence of our devas should be made even more louder,since for us,we
know and have been sustained by them for our entire civilizational
length,and are the sustainers of the cosmos as seen by us,our gurus and
our ṛṣis. We need not pay to people who bring up frivolous excuses to
gaslight/blackmail us into reducing the dhārmika grandeur and colour of
celebrations like environment,or how faith is personal. We have either
these or the endless celebrations of the liberal West like Pride
Month/Pride Parades/various soulless corporate dungheaps. There are no
two swords in one scabbard,there is either only Indra or Vṛtra,Varāha or
Hiraṇyākṣa. Similarly there is no coexistence with these systems,despite
what many cloudy-visioned people may say otherwise. This was realized by
far greater people than me like Tilak,who spearheaded the revival of
Ganeshotsava. My standard personally for dhārmika pomp and celebrations
would be the celebrations of the Mysore rājans that can be done with
local groups/local rich men/grand buisiness folks at their own
respective grand scales as well.
