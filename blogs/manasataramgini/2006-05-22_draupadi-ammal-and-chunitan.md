title = "draupadi ammAL and chunItan"

+++
A sub-set of the smarta brahmins of Gingee, Melaccheri Kadu and parts of
the modern Telugu country upwards of Kalahasti, usually belonging to the
great sect of bR^ihatcharaNaM or rarely the vaDamas (northerners), are
called pAratiyAr-s. There are other pAratiyAr-s belonging the middle
caste vELALar-s. Both of them are associated with the draupadi ammAL
temples of the region, whose many patrons are vanniyar-s. The vanniyar-s
are described by some as shUdra or avarNa, but their and internal
beliefs point to the possibility that they were actually vahni-kula
rAjaputra-s. Both the smArta and vELALar pAratiyArs are experts in the
narration of the mahAbhArataM or the makApArataM as they respectively
call it. Their versions are obviously different. The vELALar version, is
very popular with the vanniyars and they enact it in kuttu-s or
Dravidian dance-dramas, though the smArta version too is enacted by
these actors. The vELALar form is ahistoric, anachronistic and full of
local Dravidian deities. While the smArtas too incorporate some of these
their narrative of the draupadi ammAL kathai has an interesting
consistency with the paurANIc narratives.

The critical smArta version recorded in full by mAtAshrI’s clanswoman
goes thus:  
1\) bhIma the second pANDava killed baka in the outskirts of
ekachakra.  
2\) His terrified attendents and wives begged bhima to spare them. He
agreed but asked them to leave ekachakra for good.  
3\) In the reign of king shuchadratha, 6 rulers after king janamejaya
pArikShita, hastinApura was drowned by the unexpected flood. The king
and his family fled the place with the surivors.  
4\) A colateral kuru prince vR^iShNiman declared himself king of the
kuru realm. But by then shuchadratha had reached kaushambi, where he
established a new city and declared himself ruler again.  
5\) In the new kuru capital of kaushambi, sunitha succeeded
shuchadratha  
6\) achalAdhipa, a rAkShasa and descendent of baka, attacks sunItha and
ravages his kingdom. He has a hundred heads and he could not be killed
if 99 of them are cut. Anyone who cut the 100th head would die
instantaneously like the curse of vR^iddhakShatra and jayadratha.  
7\) He is told by his brAhmaNa-s that he has to invoke draupadi to
incarnate again.  
8\) sunItha goes to the Himalayas and performs a fire ritual. As he
casts the oblations in the fire, draupadi emerges from it holding a
trishUla, shakti and pAsha.  
9\) The draupadi asks sunItha to get her assistant yuddhapati (tamil:
pOrmannan or pOttu-rAjan, a popular vanniyar deity) to help her in the
campaign, and he duely does so.  
10\) After a fierce fight she cuts of all the heads and finally severs
the 100th head with her trishUla. But before it could fall to the ground
yuddhapati grabs it and keeps holding it for enternity.  
11\) sunIta founds the cult of draupadi by building her primal temple
and in its AvarNa there is yuddhapati with the achala’s severed head.
The Gingee temple and others in the region are said to be replicas of
this original temple of sunItha.

In some versions pOtturAja comes out of li\~Nga.
