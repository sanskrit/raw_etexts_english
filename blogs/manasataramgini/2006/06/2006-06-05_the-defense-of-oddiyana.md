The famed pITha of oDDiyAna on the earthly plane, was the in kingdom of
oDDiyAna, which was ruled by the clansmen of shubhakara-siMha. The last
days of this glorious pITha under the constant assault of the
Mohammedans poorly known, but we can piece together some details from
the Chinese chronicles and the rAjatara\~NgiNi of kalhaNa. The heroic
Hindu resistance in this region is largely forgotten but we provide an
outline, which we hope to fill in the future.

- In 670 CE the first wave of Jihadis reached close to Kabul (kUbha) but
were repulsed.  
- In 710 CE the Mohammedans attacked the northern zone of the region
associated with oDDiyAna, the province of Kapisa. This was an early
full-fledged attack on Hindu territory, a few years before the invasion
of Multan (mUlasthAna) by Mohammed ibn Qasim. The Moslem army was
however beaten back by a special defense force instituted by the Hindus
to protect Kapisa.  
- 713 CE, chandrapIDa, the kArkoTaka king of Kashmir defeated a Moslem
attempt to invade Kashmir.  
- 713 CE oDDiyAna attacked by Moslems but they are repulsed.  
- 715 CE Arab and Tibetans forming an alliance invaded Ferghana and took
it. The Chinese, Hindu and Zoroasterian alliance fought an 8 hour battle
to defeat the Arabs. The Chinese massacred 1000 Arabs as they fell into
their hands.  
- 715 CE Jihadis pour into Kashgar and ravage it completely.  
- 720 CE Ghazis attack oDDiyAna again. Young shubhakara siMha defeats
Moslem invaders in the great battle of oDDiyAna.  
- 741 CE Moslems launch another invasion of oDDiyAna- they are defeated
again.

The Moslems are described as wearing black turbans like their successors
the modern Taleban.
