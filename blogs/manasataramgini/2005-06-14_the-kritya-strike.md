title = "The kR^ityA strike"

\-Our shachiva for the first time was shaken by the hit but could not do
much useful at all. We still hold on to him as he has always been
trustworthy at the last ditch attempt, which cannot be achieved without
his abilities in that direction.  
\-Our amAtya made a valiant attempt with the mantras. We saw it take on
the kR^ityA, but it eventually lost and our amAtya was beaten
thoroughly.  
\-The chera magician’s cryptic spell ran thus: The brain of the tree’s
root was hacked off; the 2 older male fruits of the plant shall be
consumed by the two kR^ityAs we have despatched.  
\-R warned me that I was descending deep in to a pile of shit. It looks
as though she was right.
