Having broken the snare, avoided the concealed traps, and forcibly
broken nets,  
escaping bundles of flaming fire brands \[running\] far from the
forest;  
Though in within the range of the huntsmen’s arrows bounding away with
great speed, goes the deer,  
And it has fallen in a well, so indeed what can a man do when fate is
adverse\!  
\-A verse by the great emperor lalitAditya of kAshmIra

It is interesting that lalitAditya composed this verse. It was even a
matter of seriousness that it came from him – after all he was one of
the great heroes of our land who had brought to a stop the march of the
marUnmatta-s exploding from the west and the chIna-s pouring from the
east. And in his own home turf he brought to an end the neo-maurya
yashovarman, the destroyer of the rising Bengali pride, praised by the
great kavi vAkpati rAjA. Then he went beyond to subjugate the proud
karNATa-s and kali\~Nga-s of the east limits of bhAratavarSha. But in
the end he knew well how all this kShatra-glory could come to naught and
even his land cease to exist. It emphasized to us, as our old Iranian
cousins and rivals would say, that the lordly Xvarena is like falcon
that sits on ones shoulder today and on another’s tomorrow.

As we lay like the valiant dattAjI shinde, we thought: “If we survive we
will fight again\!”. Then we wondered if the grip of mR^ityu may over
take us before the highest conquests are achieved. Glory does not lie
far away to those who are given luck by the deva-s but it is only few
who grasp it thereafter, the rest sinking much like lalitAditya’s deer.
This indeed we call fate. After all, bhartR^ihari had said in the days
of yore:  
khalvATo divaseshvarasya kiraNaiH saMtApito mUrdhani  
ChAyAm AtapavairiNIm anusaran bilvasya mUlaM gataH |  
tatraapy Ashu kadAchid eva patatA bilvena bhagnaM shiraH  
prAyo gachChati yatra bhAgya-rahitas tatrApadAM bhAjanam ||

The baldy scalded on his head by the rays of the lord of the day,  
seeking the sun-shielding shade went to the foot of a bilva tree;  
there, then by chance indeed swiftly fell a bilva fruit which cracked
his skull;  
Perhaps wherever the luckless goes, there he attains misfortune\!

Why indeed are we in these straits we wondered? In the great back to
back battles of rAvaNa’s heads and the Aditya-s we rode past the smoke
and dust leaving behind many who were perishing or being defeated.
Having surpassed our striving rivals as any man must, we sat beside the
collyrium-hued tribesman with his ouija board. He plied the ouija and
uttered some right forecasts, like the fall of the
[nakShatradarShA](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/the-fall-of-the-nakshatra-darsha/).
We then asked a question at the goading of our clansman. The answer
came: “When you conjoin with her who is the cloud you will complete the
[first
circle](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/07/the-first-circle/)”.
While cryptic to most, we understood what it meant, and so did our
clansman. Hence, he remarked go forth to the tIkShNatripathikA, who is
among rarest of the rare. We turned to him and said: ”She will be a
chatuShpathikA not a tIkShNatripathikA. May be the tIkShNatripathikA is
for you” Then the tribal looked up and said: “He will enjoy the pleasure
of several but not the tIkShNatripathikA nor varAvantikA.” That night we
went to the kulA\~NganA and mentioned the forecast. She laughed and
said: “Hey, ouija boards cannot tell you the future.” We pressed her:
“You seem to know more than that statement belies.” She spoke like
völva to the old German Ariovistus : “I wish you had understood when
the niShAda’s board called out nabhas. These battles of the enemies of
vasiShTha or the months will be nothing when the time of that great
battle comes. You will be tested like never before and the cloud shall
descend upon the battlefield. You would need to continue fighting even
after your ratha has broken up and you have been wounded by the great
astra-s. In the cremation ground saMmelana when you conjoin with me in
the great churning of the bhairava the dreadful yoginI-s of the
jAla-shaMbara will come to give you the sword that will take you to
victory in battle and we’ll be omniscient in yoga. In the Ragnarok-like
future, you will hasten to the cremation ground for the saMmelana with
me, bewitching as ever, but you will be struck by the pAshastaMbhinI
prayoga of bagalAmukhI.”

Then:  
While we prepared to fight, we were attacked by the mighty force. It
felt like the unstoppable kuMbhakarNa demolishing hanUmat:  
hanUmA\~n shaila-shR^i\~NgANi shilAsh cha vividhAn drumAn |  
vavarSha kumbhakarNasya shirasy ambaram AsthitaH ||  
hanumAn flying in the sky showered mountain tops, rocks, and a variety
of trees on kumbhakarNa’s head.

tAni parvata-shR^i\~NgANi shUlena tu bibheda ha |  
babha\~nja vR^ikSha-varShaM cha kumbhakarNo mahAbalaH ||  
The mighty kuMbhakarNa smashed to pieces those mountain peaks and the
shower of trees with his trident.

tato harINAM tad anIkam ugraM  
dudrAva shUlaM nishitaM pragR^ihya |  
tasthau tato .asyaapatataH purastAn  
mahIdharAgraM hanumAn pragR^ihya ||  
Seizing his sharp trident he rushed against the fierce army of the
monkeys. There stood hanumAn in front of him holding a mountain peak
even as he advanced.

sa kumbhakarNaM kupito jaghAna  
vegena shailottama bhImakAyam |  
sa chukShubhe tena tadAbhibhUto  
medArdra gAtro rudhirAvasiktaH ||  
Enraged, with great velocity he struck kuMbhakarNa, who was endowed with
a terrible body like a great mountain. He \[kumbhakarNa\] was agitated
when humiliated by that blow and his limbs were wet with fat and blood.

sa shUlam Avidhya taDit-prakAshaM  
giriM yathA prajvalitAgra-shR^i\~Ngam |  
bAhvantare mArutim AjaghAna  
guho .achalaM krau\~ncham ivogra-shaktyA ||  
Striking with that trident emitting electrical discharge, resembling an
erupting volcanic peak, he smote mAruti between his arms, even as kumAra
had struck the unshakeable krau\~Ncha with his fiery shakti.

sa shUla nirbhinna mahAbhujAntaraH  
pravihvalaH shoNitam udvaman mukhAt |  
nanAda bhImaM hanumAn mahAhave  
yugAnta megha-stanita-svanopamam ||  
As the trident cleaved him between his great arms in that great battle,
hanuman vomited blood from his mouth, and uttering a great cry like the
thunder from a cloud at the end of a yuga, and he lost consciousness.

tato vineduH sahasA prahR^iShTA  
rakShogaNAs taM vyathitaM samIkShya |  
plavaMgamAs tu vyathitA bhayArtAH  
pradudruvuH saMyati kumbhakarNAt ||  
Seeing him thus felled the rakSha-s ranks rejoiced and erupted in
cheers. The wounded monkeys thus afflicted with fear of kuMbhakarNa fled
from the battle.

As we lay thus with a part of our consciousness curtained by the pain in
our mind flashed the words: “gAyatraM gAyatrI varuNAya”. We thought of
our ancient clansman shunaHshepa. Could we continue in this great
battle? But then the man who stops fighting dies.
