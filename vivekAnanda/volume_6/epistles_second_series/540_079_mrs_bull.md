## LXXIX

C/O E. T. STURDY, ESQ.,  
HIGH VIEW, CAVERSHAM, READING, ENGLAND,  
*17th Sept., 1895*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

Mr. Sturdy and I want to get hold of a few of the best, say, strong and
intelligent men in England to form a society, and therefore we must
proceed slowly. We must take care not to be run over with "fads" from
the first. This you will know has been my policy in America too. Mr.
Sturdy has been in India living with our Sannyasins in their manner for
some time. He is an exceedingly energetic man, educated and well versed
in Sanskrit. ... So far so good. ... Purity, perseverance, and energy —
these three I want, and if I get only half a dozen here, my work will go
on. I have a great chance of such a few. 

VIVEKANANDA.
