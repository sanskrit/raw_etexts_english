## CXXXVIII

C/O. LALA HANSRAJ,  
RAWALPINDI,  
*12th Oct., 1897.*

DEAR M[1](#fn1) —

*C’est bon, mon ami* — now you are doing just the thing, Come out, man!
No sleeping all life; time is flying. Bravo! That is the way.

Many thanks for your publication. Only, I am afraid it will not pay its
way in a pamphlet form. . . . Never mind, pay or no pay — let it see the
blaze of daylight. You will have many blessings on you and many more
curses — but that is always the way of the world!

This is the time.

Yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#txt1)Mahendra Nath Gupta or "Master Mahashaya", recorder of
    Shri Ramakrishna Kathamrita, or the Gospel of Shri Ramakrishna, in
    Bengali.
