*To Munshi Jagmohanlal*

BALLEN VILLE  
DARJEELING

*15 April 1898*

MY DEAR JAGMOHAN,[1](#fn1)

If you can find out all the letters that I addressed to H.H. on my way
to — and stay in — Japan, Europe and America, please do send them
carefully packed, under registered cover, to my address in the Math, as
early as possible.

With blessing to you,

I remain,  
Yours truly,  
VIVEKANANDA
