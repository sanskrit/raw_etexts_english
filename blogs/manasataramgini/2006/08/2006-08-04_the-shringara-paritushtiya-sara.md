+++
The shR^i\~NgAra-parituShTIya sAra is viewed with intense embarrassment
by the modern Hindu. At every level he or she would not like to believe
that such texts were composed by their ancestors. I admit that literally
translating some of its terms might sound embarrassingly absurd, but I
suspect they are not supposed to sound as foolish as the literal
translations are. But then I am not the kind of Hindu who is “modern” in
outlook, and still linger on in the early centuries of the Hindu era. So
I do not feel any coyness about much of this. Nor am I a
pseudo-scientist filled with the zeal that characterizes Abrahmistic
messianisms to cleanse my compatriots of so-called irrational thought.
So here is its un-adulterated summary:

The vaiShNava formulae for women to bewitch men:

brahmadaNDI vachA kuShThaM priya\~Ngavar-nAgakesharaM |   
dadyAt tAmbUla saMyuktaM strINAM mantreNa tadvasham |   
oM nArAyaNyai svAhA ||   
tAmbUlaM yasya dIyeta sa vashI syAt sumantrataH |  
oM hariH hariH svAhA ||

A woman wishing to fascinate a man will make a mixture of the herbs
brahmadaNDI, vAchA kuShTha, priya\~Ngu and nAgakeshara, utter the above
incantation to the goddess nArAyaNi and give the mixture as a tAMbUla to
her man. After she has given the mixture she shall utter the incantation
to the god viShNu (above).

kha\~njarITasya mAMsaM tu madhunA saha peShayet |  
R^itu-kAle yoni lepAt puruSho dAsatAmiyAt ||

The woman should grind the kha\~njarITa flesh with honey and apply it to
her vagina at the time of her menstrual flow. Her man would become her
slave.

durAlabhA vachA kuShThaM ku\~Nkuma\~n cha shatAvarI |  
tila-tailena saMyuktaM yoni lepAd vashI naraH ||

durAllabha, vAchA, kuShTha, ku\~Nkuma and shatavarI plants are ground
into the oil of sesame seeds and applied as a lubricant to the vagina.
This makes the woman bewitch her lover.

Formula and preparation for men to bewitch women:

mahAsugandhikA mUlaM shukraM stambhet kaTau sthitam |  
oM namaH sarvasattvebhyo namaH siddhiM kuru kuru svAhA   
saptAbhi-mantritaM kR^itvA karavIrasya puShpakam |  
strINAmagre bhrAmayachCha kShaNAd vai sA vashe bhavet |  
brahmadaNDIM vachAM patraM madhunA saha peShayet |  
a\~Nga lepAchCha vanitA nAnyaM bhartAramichChati ||

He smears the extract of the root of the mahAsugandhikA plant on his
pelvis and prevents premature ejaculation. He then utters the above
incantation seven times and prepares an extract of the karavIra flowers.
He then sprinkles this on the woman and in instantaneously bewitches
her. He grinds a paste with honey of the brahmadaNDI, vAchA and patra
plants and applies it on his member. His woman will never seek another
man.

The aids of the goddesses:

rochanA gandha puShpANi nimba puShpaM priya\~NgavaH |  
ku\~NkamaM chandanaM chaiva tilakena jagad vashet |  
oM hrIM gaurI devI saubhAgyaM putravashAdi dehi me svAhA ||  
oM hrIM lakShmI devI saubhAgyaM sarvaM trailokyamohanam svAhA ||

One applies the paste of fragrant rochana flowers, neem flowers and
priya\~Ngu grains along with chandana and vermillion on ones fore head.
One then makes oblations respectively to gaurI and lakShmI for the sake
of children and bewitching the 3 worlds.

oM raktachAmuNDe \[amukaM\] me vashamAnaya Anaya oM hrIM hrUM hraH phaT
| |  
By applying a tilaka with her menstrual blood and gorochana a woman can
subjugate any target by meditating on the above formula.

There is also a preparation for a woman who has even had several
children to look like virgin. But this is garbled and needs further
reconstruction.  
  
oM namaH khaDga-vajrapANaye mahA-yakSha-senApataye svAhA | oM rudraM
hrAM hrIM varashaktA tvaritA-vidyA | oM mAtaraH stambhayata svAhA ||   

By meditating on the above formulae on the lord of the yakSha army,
rudra and the goddess tvaritA one wards of thieves sneaking into one’s
domain.
