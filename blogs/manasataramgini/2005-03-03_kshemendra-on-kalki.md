title = "kShemendra on kalki"

+++
The great Kashmirian author in his text the dashAvatAracharitra which
was written in 1066 AD describes the conditions that would prevail on
the earth just before the coming of kalki. 
 
“The Turushkas, Pathans, Daradas and dwellers of Shakastan will cause
the earth to decay as do the leper his open oozing sores. Every
direction overrun by the dreadful mlechChas, the earth will resound with
the clash of swords drawn in combat and her soil will be soaked with
blood.”

The manthAnabhairava tantra’s colophon has a statement that in the
rakSha rAvaNa incarnated to the west of the sindhu with the ripening of
the kali yuga . His presence shall initiate the barbarous tyranny of the
mlechChas who will spread havoc and bloodshed throughout the world.

Thus, the kAlachakra tantra and the Hindu depictions are quite parallel
and definitely inspired by the dreaded advent of Islam \[a problem that
continues to seize the world\].
