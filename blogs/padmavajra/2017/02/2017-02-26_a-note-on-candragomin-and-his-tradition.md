On reading [this
note](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/03/23/musings-on-some-alternative-grammarians/)
by manasataramgini,the following note from Tārānātha came to my mind

Candragomīn had travelled to the South,in the temple of the brāhmaṇa
Vararuci,where he came across an image of Vararuci acquiring the śāstra
of vyākāraṇa from
[Śeṣa-nāga](https://padmavajrablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/c1737-patanjali-1-tibetan.jpg).
He then thought that a commentary should be brief,profound in
significance,with no repititions and complete,which Śeṣa-nāga’s
commentary was not. He then composed his Candra-vyākāraṇa ,following
Pāṇini’s grammar and remarked ‘This work,though brief,is clear and
complete’.(Tārānātha remarks that even this remārk was a harsh criticism
of the Nāga).

Some trivial points to note here

-   The identification of Pātāñjali as the incarnation of
    Śeṣa(implicitly),and his commentary(the fact that it’s referred to
    as lengthy gives it away)
-   The identification of the Varttikakara Vararuci/Katyayana and his
    linkage to the tradition of Pātañjali in vyākāraṇa-śāstra.



That debate of Candragomī and the nāstika mahāpaṇḍita Candrakīrti lasted
for 7 years,and the debate ended after Candrakīrti discovered
Avalokiteśvara teaching Candragomī.

Also,the tradition of the Bauddhas recognizes a vyākāraṇa of
Candrakīrti’s in the same(Bauddha) tradition that was superior to
Candragomī’s,named the Samantabhadra. It was bhaṭṭārikā āryā
[Tārā](http://jampaydorje.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Emerald-Tara19.jpg)
who said that this vyākāraṇa of Candragomī’s would survive,while the one
of Candrakīrti’s would be lost because of his pride in his scholarship.
And Tārānātha notes that the well in which Candragomī threw his book
in(and later pulled it out of)-those who drank water from that well were
immediately filled with great wisdom.
