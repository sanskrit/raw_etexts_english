title = "The sleep of dhUmAvatI"

+++
We have heard of the nairR^ita spell of dhUmA which overpowers you with
tremendous force. Even as we were scanning the horizon for the nirR^iti
attack, the spell found its mark on us with the ucChuShma-rudra wings.
The torpor it induced was unbearable, we twice fell asleep in the very
place in which we were. The spell also has a peculiar effect on the
mind- it causes a mental vibration with lingering unpleasant and
delusive images from which one cannot break free. It also induces a
grave fear of the foe and all manner of bodily aches as it seizes you.
Shortly after we awoke from the spell the khANDvans attacked directly.
We simply decided to brush them aside knowing that their power came from
the spell.
