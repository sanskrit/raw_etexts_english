## ON AMERICAN WOMEN

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 1, p. 208.)

\[*Daily Iowa Capitol*, November 30, 1893\]

The now celebrated Hindu monk, Swami Vivekananda will lecture for the
last time in Des Moines tonight. He will speak on "Life in India"
\["Manners and Customs of India"\] a most interesting theme. The
renowned Hindu is a brilliant man about 30 years old. He says American
women are lovely, but American men are entirely too practical.
