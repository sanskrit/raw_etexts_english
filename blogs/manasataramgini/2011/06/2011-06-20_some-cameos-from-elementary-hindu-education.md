An ancient anonymous textbook from my grandparents’ time used by my aunt
for her education in the devabhAShA is one of the best introductory
elementary textbooks on the language I have seen. It not only introduced
the student to the Arya-vAk but also inculcated a sense of Aryatva in
them via introduction the dharma.  
Below is an abstract from the same that educating a child on homonymy:

Recently my pitAshrI inquired about an elementary problem presented by
one of the greatest mathematicians of our tradition, bhAskara, who
graced the seuna yAdava court. While it is a simple quadratic problem it
has a certain beauty in its versification in the mAlinI meter. We showed
it to a few friends to take some delight in the educational devices in
devabhAShA. Then it struck us that it would be a good test for R’s
legendary IQ. She took a few minutes with the saMskR^ita, but not with
the mathematics – we think her abilities are undiminished on the whole
:-)

The square root of 1/2 a cluster of bees translocated to a mAlatI creep,
there after went 8/9ths of the total number bees, remaining was a one
queen bee, which buzzed to the other remaining drone which was trapped
in the midst of a lotus that closed for the night. Tell me dear lady the
total count of bees (bhAskara addressing his daughter lIlAvatI).

The answer to it may be obtained among other ways by setting the total
number of bees=8\*x^2 and solving the ensuing quadratic:
4\*x^2-9\*x-9=0  
Hence, the ali-saMkhyA = 72
