There are some angles that we often encounter in the construction of the
golden ratio and its use in religious art. The first is the most obvious
is the angle
![\\dfrac{2\\pi}{5}=72^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdfrac%7B2%5Cpi%7D%7B5%7D%3D72%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\dfrac{2\\pi}{5}=72^o") which is the angle made by the diagonals
connecting a side of the regular pentagon to a vertex. Thus, for a unit
pentagon
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") is the length of its diagonals. This captures the quintessence,
literally the five-ness of
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi"). This angle was used in Hindu tradition as can be seen in the
figure below. Here the angle and
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") are deployed in one of the most remarkable religious works from
the Vaṅga country (region of modern Balurghat) — a liṅga on the four
sides of which are the four kula-yoginī-s of the directional āmnāya-s.
This is keeping with the deployment of the golden ratio in other figures
of the kaula tradition like the Kubjikā and śrī yantra-s.

![golden\_yoginIs](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/golden_yoginis.jpg?w=640)

In the previous note on finding the translation vectors for the golden
construction we encountered the famous angle
![\\theta=\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2\\phi-1}\\right)=\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2\\phi-1}\\right)=\\tan^{-1}(2)
\\approx63.43^o](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta%3D%5Csin%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B2%7D%7B2%5Cphi-1%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Ccos%5E%7B-1%7D%5Cleft%28%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Cphi-1%7D%5Cright%29%3D%5Ctan%5E%7B-1%7D%282%29+%5Capprox63.43%5Eo&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\theta=\\sin^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{2}{2\\phi-1}\\right)=\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2\\phi-1}\\right)=\\tan^{-1}(2) \\approx63.43^o").
This angle is the supplementary angle of the dihedral angle of a
dodecahedron that quintessentially quintessent object. This angle comes
up often in the construction of golden ratio with the
bhujā-koṭi-karṇa-nyāya, which we place here along with other
miscellany for the record. Indeed, Posamentier and Lehmann point out in
their wonderful monograph on the golden ratio that Johannes Kepler had
said: “*Geometry harbors two great treasures: One is the Pythagorean
theorem, and the other is the golden ratio. The first we can compare
with a heap of gold, and the second we simply call a priceless jewel.*”
While these are rather elementary constructions, we are just putting
down a few of them for own record and the instruction of those in need.

**Construction 1:**

Using the angle bisector theorem we have:

"\\therefore \\; \\overline{AJ}=\\phi")

A construction such as these can be also used to easily construct a
model of the great pyramid of king Khufu of Egypt. We illustrate this
below using construction 2 with 3 unit squares:  
![golden\_pyramid\_khufu](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/golden_pyramid_khufu.jpg?w=640)

1\) The first of these is used to construct a square of side 2 units
BEDC, which forms the base of the pyramid.  
2\) We then use the above construction to obtain
![\\overline{OF}=\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOF%7D%3D%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OF}=\\phi").  
3\) We then deploy the geometric mean theorem in the vertical plane on
![\\overline{OG}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOG%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OG}") and
![\\overline{OF}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOF%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OF}") to obtain
![\\overline{OA}=\\sqrt{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Coverline%7BOA%7D%3D%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\overline{OA}=\\sqrt{\\phi}"), which will be the height of the
pyramid.  
4\) We then join the vertices of the base square BEDC to form the model
pyramid of Khufu.

![shrIchakra](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/shrichakra.jpg?w=640)One
will notice that the cross-section of the great pyramid is the
![\\triangle
GAL](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctriangle+GAL&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\triangle GAL") with base 2 and isoceles sides
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi"). This triangle is the same as the great śrīkaṇṭha triangle of
the śrī-cakra. Possibly the Hemiunu used such a construction to model
his pyramid. There has been some debate since the modern rediscovery of
the golden ratio in the great pyramid as to whether the Egyptians really
knew of it or not. When we account for the the remarkable casing stones
and the damage over the centuries the dimensions of the great pyramids
does come strikingly close to the above constructed model. The clinching
factor is the statement of the yavana Herodotus who evidently recording
an Egyptian tradition noted that the square of the height of the great
pyramid is equal to the area of triangular faces. From the above
construction one can see that this implies that the pyramid had to have
the height
![\\sqrt{\\phi}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B%5Cphi%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\sqrt{\\phi}") and the isoceles sides of the cross-section of through
the middle of the square base being
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi"). Thus, some form of expressing the golden ratio, perhaps in the
form of a construction like the above was known to the Egyptians.

This makes the great pyramid at \~2560 BCE perhaps the first monument in
world history to encode this famed ratio. It is simultaneously a stark
reminder of a great ancient civilization and how it can vanish despite
it achievements. But due to the encoding of this information on a
monumental scale a glimpse of ancient Egypt’s knowledge has come down to
us. Indeed the scale and the brilliant engineering of the pyramids has
helped them survive the attempts to erase them: Al-Malik al-Aziz Uthman
the son of the counter-crusader Salah ad-Din who wanted clean Giza of
its jāhilīyah devoted a large amount of labor to demolish the pyramids
but only having succeeded in damaging the smallest of the big three
eventually gave up. Then the Mamluqs of Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan carved out
the casing stones of the great pyramid to build masjids but could not
get down the colossus. However, there is no guarantee that in the coming
years a Mohammedan upheaval in Egypt does what their predecessors wished
but failed to do.

This brings us to whether the Hindus and yavana-s obtained the idea of
using
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") from the Egyptians. This is plausible since they are seen using
a construction that embodies this ratio much before the other two. The
yavana-s show a clear record of the ratio and specific constructions for
the first time in the work of Euclid. Given Euclid was recording earlier
geometric knowledge it might have been known sometime before him as
suggested by
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi") used by Phidias in several architectural features of the
Parthenon. This was around the same time Herodotus records relationship
concerning the great pyramid. Hence, we at least have evidence for
Greek-Egyptian contact where a construction involving this ratio is
recorded supporting the possibility that the yavana-s obtained the
concept from the Egyptians before it was mathematically formalized in
Euclid.

The Indian situation is less clear but offers certain interesting clues.
The as yet mysterious Harappan civilization was undoubtedly in contact
with Egypt at a time reasonably close to when the great pyramid was
constructed. Yet, I have so far not found any evidence for the use of
golden ratio-related constructions in the Harappan artefacts that I have
seen. The Indo-Aryan tradition abounds in extensive geometric
constructions related the śrauta ritual. There is no evidence for the
use of golden ratio-related constructions in the early Indo-Aryan śrauta
tradition among the bricks, altars or ritual halls. Since this tradition
was something derived from the common ancestral tradition that also
seeded Greek geometry, it is likely that in old Indo-European tradition
the golden ratio did not play any major role. However, in the late
Atharvavedic tradition we find the construction of a regular pentagonal
altar for Vāyu where the ratio could have been involved (“vartulaṃ
pañcakoṇaṃ…vāyavyāṃ pañcakoṇaṃ tu vāyavyeṣv api karman ||“).

On the other hand we see a completely distinct mathematical approach
which yields a series whose limiting ratio is
![\\phi](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\phi"): the Meru of Piṅgala. This at its latest would have been close
to Phidias in antiquity but there is no evidence that the numbers of the
Meru were used in a geometric construction. With the rise of
recognizable Indian iconography, i.e. the iconographic tradition that
has remained rather conservative since then, suddenly the golden ratio
appears in certain examples. Below is one of its early appearances in a
tāthāgata context from Sarnath.

![golden\_buddha](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/golden_buddha.jpg?w=640)

I am aware of another case of a terracotta image of Rudra and Uma from
Rangmahal, Rajasthan belonging to the first few centuries of the common
era present in a Golden rectangle. However, I need to examine a clearer
image of this icon to confirm this. While iconographic examples such as
these might be disputed, the śrīcakra is a rather clear illustration.
Any direct connection to yavana tradition for these Hindu examples can
hardly be established. Moreover, the ratio does not play any role to our
knowledge in the classic Hindu successor mathematical tradition of the
śrauta constructions. Thus, it appears to have been a para-mathematical
tradition that primarily survived in a religious context illustrating
that classical Hindu mathematical tradition does not encompass all of
Hindu mathematical knowledge. Other examples of such include the
Platonic solids in bead manufacture in ancient India or the ellipse in
temple architecture.
