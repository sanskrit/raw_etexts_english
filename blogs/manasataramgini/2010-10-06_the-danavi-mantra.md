title = "The dAnavI mantra"

+++
There are two vidyA-s of viliste\~NgA. The first is the oShadhi prayoga
which is known to the bhArgava-s as per the atharvaNa shruti (AV-vulgate
7.38.2). But this lore is only for women. The other is the celebrated
dAnavI or AsurI mantra which is known to a proper mantravAdin. He may
use it with just an oblation of ghee or with the secret plant depending
on the circumstance:  
yA tirashchI nipadyate.ahaM vidharaNI iti | tAM tvA ghR^itasya dhArayA
yaje viliste\~NgAm aham svAhA || vasiShThAyai svAhA | Asuryai svAhA |
indrapriyAyai svAhA ||  
He then stirs out of his ritual enclosure. If he sees a beautiful woman
shortly there after it is a signal of his success.

If he wishes to perform the great prayoga he shall have 4 beautiful
women as uttara-sAdhaka-s. He shall first consecrate himself as per the
received lore and then consecrate the uttara-sAdhaka-s with the
appropriate names. He shall hold a shara reed in his left hand offer
with a darvi held in his right hand. He shall then deploy the below form
of the viliste\~NgA vidyA:  
yA indrapriye tirashchI nipadyate.ahaM vidharaNI iti tAM tvA ghR^itasya
dhArayA yaje viliste\~NgAM vasiShThAM AsurIm mAyAm aham svAhA ||  
Then he shall deploy aindra mAdhava mantra:  
rUpaM rUpaM pratirUpo babhUva tadasya rUpaM pratichakShaNAya|  
indro mAyAbhiH puru-rUpa Iyate yuktA hyasya harayaH shatA dasha ||  
He shall offer after this verse with a: phaT |  
Then he shall intertwine the above form of the viliste\~NgA vidyA with
the aindra collection known to the practitioners of the taittirIya
shruti as atharvashiras. He shall offer oblations after each mantra of
the atharvashiras with a: phaT | Then he shall deploy the mantra:  
tvaM mAyAbhir apa mAyino.adhamaH svadhAbhirye adhi shuptAv ajuhvata |  
tvaM pipror nR^imaNaH prArujaH puraH pra R^ijishvAnaM dasyu-hatyeShv
Avitha ||  
He offers the shara reed with: khaT phaT mR^it ||  
Then he deploys that which the taittirIyaka-s call the pratya\~NgirasaM.
