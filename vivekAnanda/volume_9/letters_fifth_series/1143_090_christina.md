*To Sister Christine*

1628 INDIANA AVE.  
CHICAGO, ILL.  
\[*April 6, 1896*\]

DEAR CHRISTINA,

\[Line excised.\] reply as soon as possible.

I am going forward to New York on Thursday \[April 9\] and \[will\]
start for England on the 15th of April.

Goodby and love to you all — to Mrs. Funkey \[Funke\], to Mrs. Phelps
and all the rest of our friends.

In this life we meet and part again and again; but the mind is
omnipresent and can be, hear, and feel anywhere.

Yours with love and blessings,  
VIVEKANANDA

P.S. Give Kripananda and Miss \[Martha\] Hamilton my love and blessings
when you meet them next.

V.

\[Written in the margin:\] I will go to New York next Friday \[April
10\].
