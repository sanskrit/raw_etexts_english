## CCXXVII

*To Sister Christine*

THE MATH, BELUR, DIST. HOWRAH,

*21st June 1902*.

MY DEAR CHRISTINE,

You have not the least cause to be anxious. I am getting on anyhow and
am quite strong. As to diet, I find I have to restrict myself and not
follow the prescription of my doctor to eat anything I like. The pills
continue, however. Will you ask the boys if they can get "Amalaki"
\[*Emblic myrobalan*\] fruits in the place now? We cannot get them in
the plains now. They are rather sour and puckery eaten raw; but make
marmalade of whole \[ones\] — delicious. Then they are the best things
for fermentation I ever get.

No anxiety on the score of Marie Louise's[1](#fn1) arrival in Calcutta.
She has not yet made any noise.

Things go on the same. I am trying to go to Monghyr — a place near
Calcutta and said to be very salubrious.

We will think of your coming to Baghbazar after Nivedita has fairly
started; till then keep quiet and lay on food.

With all love to yourself, the boys and Mother \[Mrs. Charlotte
Sevier\],

VIVEKANANDA.

PS — I am laying on adipose tissues fast — especially about the
abdominal regions: "It is fearful to see!"
