The uttarabhAga of the brahmANDa purANa contains a large body of
shrIkula tAntrika material. Some tAntrika-s mention that this section
contains the dharma for the kaula practitioner. Other tAntrika-s hold
that the tame views presented here are still a sign of duality which a
genuine practitioner of kulAchara might transcend. Clearly, the emphasis
here is on activities for a smArta brAhmaNa or one from any of the other
varNa-s who is affiliated with smArta authority, but wishes to perform
sAdhana-s and upAsana-s prescribed in the kaula shAstra-s. This is thus
the bR^ihaspati dharma as adapted for a smArta practicing the tAntrika
krama-s of the said shAstra-s. This should not be confused with the
activities of a sAdhaka who \*is\* a kaula and considers other shAstra-s
as pashu shAstra-s. For example regarding liquors we encounter the
following injunctions:

*paiShTikaM tAlajaM kairaM mAdhUkaM guDasaMbhavam |  
kramAn-nyUnataraM pApaM tadarddhArddhArddhatastathA ||  
kShatriyAdi trivarNAnAm AsavaM peyam uchyate |  
strINAm api tR^itIyAdi peyaM syAd brAhmaNIM vinA ||*

The liquors are generally classified as a beer, toddy, coconut toddy,
mead and sugar cane liquor. A brAhmaNa male is prohibited from drinking
these. A woman from the remaining three varNa-s might drink liquors
except beer and toddy. Here again a brAhmaNa woman is proscribed from
drinking any liquor.

The bR^ihaspati dharma recognizes that in kaula rituals liquor is used.
But here again it is rather clear regarding a smArta brAhmaNa being
forbidden from using it:  
*lakShmIH sarasvatI gaurI chaNDikA tripurAMbikA |  
bhairavo bhairavI kAlI mahAshAstrI cha mAtaraH ||  
anyAshcha shaktayas tAsAM pUjane madhu shasyate |  
brAhmaNastu vinA tena yajed vedA\~Nga pAragaH ||*

The shakti-s mentioned include tripurAMbikA, the bhairava-bhairavI
yAmala and kAlI among others, covering the shrIkula, kAlikula and
generically the bhairvAchara derived from the bhairavatantra-s.

The same bR^ihaspati smR^iti also recognizes the fact that in the kula
ritual maithuna needs to be observed. In this context it gives two
shloka mantra-s. The first of these to viShNu and lakShmI can be used by
one even without shAstra-j\~nAna so that his acts of maithuna become
mantra-karman-s:  
*sarvAtmako vAsudevaH puruShastu purAtanaH |  
iyaM hi mUlaprakR^itir lakShmIH sarva-jagat-prasUH |  
pa\~ncApa\~ncAtma-tR^iptyarthaM mathanaM kriyatetarAm |*|

A person well-educated in the shAstra-s might observe maithuna as a part
of kula worship; however, only with the svastrI and not on prohibited
days using the second mantra:  
*iyam aMbA jagad-dhAtrI puruSho .ayaM sadAshivaH |  
pa\~ncaviMshati tattvAnAM prItaye mathyate â€˜dhunA ||*

The possibility of animal sacrifice and meat consumption in the context
of bhairavAchara is recognized by similarly providing mantra-s to make
them permissible acts. But here again meat is proscribed for a brAhmaNa
except in life and death circumstances. But the slaughter of the pashu
for the shAkta ritual might be done by the other varNa-s affiliated with
smArta tradition using the shloka mantra if he wishes to be free of
pApa:  
*shivodbhavam idam piNDamatyatha shivatAM gatam |  
udbudhyasva pasho tvaM hi nAshivaH sa\~nchivo hyasi ||  
IshaH sarva-jagat-kartA prabhavaH pralayas tathA |  
yato vishvAdhiko rudrastena rudro .asi vai pasho ||*

While retaining the proscriptions on brAhmaNa-s while engaging the kula
rituals, this bR^ihaspati smR^iti is unorthodox in certain ways i.e. it
makes attempts to accommodate Aryanizing tribals who build irrigation
works, temples of shiva and viShNu and set up agrahAra-s. The smR^iti
gives an example of such a meritorious tribal woman who was even given
the dIkSha of the shatarudrIya by a smArta brAhmaNa.
