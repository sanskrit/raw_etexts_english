title = "Thinking of kShemendra"

+++
The deva-bhASha is the language of the kavI-s right from the days of the
hoary vipra-s from the misty past of the R^igveda saMhitA. In the galaxy
of literature in the deva-vANI, which is filled with extraordinary
luminaries, kShemendra from the crest of bhArata shines like Rigel on a
clear winter night. He comes from that time, which produced a striking
constellation of encyclopedic writers, just at the twilight of the Hindu
sun. There was abhinavagupta the foremost of the tantrics of his era,
king bhojadeva-paramAra and kShemendra. kShemendra represents the
primeval spirit of the kavI, similar to that of the R^igvedic R^iShi-s.

This from his work on the incarnations of viShNu from the period when he
appeared to have became oriented towards the pA\~ncharAtra tantra-s.

From his earlier work the kavi-kaNThAbharaNa we note that he was a
practitioner of shrI-vidyA as he mentions the bAlA mantra and yantra. He
says that poetry might come as a result of mantra siddhi (divya) or due
to human effort and scholarly study. The route via siddhi is described
as requiring the worship of sarasvati in the form of the mAtR^ikA chakra
and deploying the bAlA mantra with the worship of the 3 associated
devI-s.

By “trikoNa-yuga” kShemendra is alluding to the bAlA yantra with
interlocked triangles. He specifies the bAlA mantra as “eSha bIja-trayI
vAchyA trayI vAk-kAma-mukti-sUH” i.e. aiM klIM sauH ||  
In kShemendra’s scheme the three devI-s associated with the three
divisions of the bAlA mantra are the lighting-like pramodinI, the
moon-like amR^itavAhinI and the formless shakti parAtparA. This
formulation with the 3 devI-s appears to be a unique one that does not
appear to survive in the extant bAlA deployments associated with the
kAdimata. A parallel is, however, seen in the form of the triad of bAlA
mantra-s known as the tri-hR^illekhA-s:  
hrIM hrIM hrIM prauDha-tripure Arogyam-aishvaryaM dehi svAhA |  
hrIM shrIM klIM tripurA madane sarvaM shubhaM sAdhaya svAhA |  
hrIM shrIM klIM parAtpare tripure sarvepsitaM sAdhaya svAhA |  
However, the idea of bAlA as a deity of wisdom continues in extant
kAdimata tradition.

Finally, we come to kShemendra’s recommendation for the aspiring poet
who wishes to achieve kavitva through human effort. This famous
statement has been quoted numerous times by many people (like Andrew
Schelling’s translation of Sanskrit poetry) but let me do it again in
the original saMskR^ita.

KK 2.10-11  
Aloka patra-lekhyAdau goShThI-prahasanaj\~natA |  
prekShA prANi-svabhavAnAM samudra-adristhitIkShaNaM ||

He \[the aspiring kavi\] should examine the form of leaves and their
veins, know how to make people laugh, study the behavior of living
organisms and observe the features of oceans and mountains.

ravIndu-tArA-kalanaM sarvartu-pari-bhAvanaM |  
jana-saMghaabhigamanaM desha-bhAShopajIvanaM ||

The motion of the sun, moon and stars and all the seasons he should
closely contemplate on. He should move among different peoples and
states and \[examine\] their languages and occupations.

In KK 2.2-23 we find an entire gamut of recommendations for attainment
of kavitvam. These start with the worship of vinAyaka and the yAga to
sarasvatI and untiring effort to acquire the ability of discernment.
They include, among other things, being in the company of great kavi-s
and intellectual Arya-s and through them imbibing (kShemendra uses the
Sanskrit word “chewing” or “tasting” like food) the meaning of great
kAvya:  
sahavAsaH kavi-varaIr-mahAkAvyaartha-charvaNaM |  
AryatvaM sujanair-maitrI saumanasyaM suveShatA ||  
He also mentions observing the skills of sculptors, warriors in battle,
graveyards and forests, and hearing the sorrowful lamentations:  
shilpinAM kaushala-prekSha vIra-yuddhAvalochanaM |  
shoka-pralApa-shravaNaM shmashAnaaraNya darshanaM ||

Thus, in kShemendra we see the eternal naturalist, linguist and
sociologist who is immersed in the study of the world around him. It
after all encapsulates what it has always meant for one to be a kavI
from the days of the RV – i.e. the philosophy of the kavI as a
naturalist and observer. It is not without reason that kShemendra wants
the aspiring kavI to be a scholar of astronomy, medicine, linguistics,
kAmashAstra and other things – after all even the R^ig vedic vipra-s say
“kavayo manIShAH”. It defines structure of the knowledge system which is
followed by the erudite Hindu – many of the contradictions or paradoxes
that haunt the Western mind are instead in harmony here.
