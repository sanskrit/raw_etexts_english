## II

(Translated from [Bengali](b6028ae9002.pdf) )

*To Balaram Bose*  
*Glory to Ramakrishna*

GHAZIPUR

*February 11, 1890*

RESPECTED SIR

I have received your book. In Hrishikesh, Kali \[Swami Abhedananda\] has
had a relapse and is again suffering from what seems to be malaria. Once
it comes, the fever does not easily leave those who have never had it
before. I too suffered the same way when I first had the attack of
fever. Kali has never had the fever before. I have not received any
letter from Hrishikesh. Where is . . . ?

I am suffering terribly from a backache which began in Allahabad. I had
recovered from it some time back, but it has recurred. So I will have to
stay here awhile longer because of my back and also because Babaji
\[Pavhari Baba\] has requested it.

What you have written about uncooked bread is true. But a monk dies that
way, not like the breaking of a cup and saucer. This time I am not going
to be overcome by weakness in any way. And if I die, that will be good
for me. It is better to depart from this world very soon.

Your servant,  
NARENDRA
