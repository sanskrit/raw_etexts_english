## CLXXXIV

*To Sister Christine*

6, PLACE DES ETATS UNIS,  
PARIS,

*15th September 1900*.

DEAR CHRISTINA,

Your letter was very reassuring. I am so glad this summer did you good.
So you did not get enamoured of New York City.

Well, I am getting enamoured of Paris. I now am living with a M. Jules
Bois, a French savant, who has been a student and admirer of my works.

He talks very little English; in consequence, I have to trot out my
jargon French and am succeeding well, he says. I can now understand if
he will talk slowly.

Day after tomorrow I go to Bretagne \[Brittany\] where our American
friends are enjoying the sea breeze — and the massage.[1](#fn1)

I go with M. Bois for a short visit; *après cet* \[after that\] I don't
know where I go. I am getting quite Frenchy, *connaissezvous* \[do you
know\]? I am also studying *grammaire* and hard at work. \[Sentence torn
off\] In a few months I hope to be Frenchy, but by that time I will
forget it by staying in England.

I am strong, well and content — no morbidity.

*Au revoir*,  
VIVEKANANDA.
