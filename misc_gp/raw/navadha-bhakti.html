<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">Navadha-Bhakti</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is only the principle of devotion which is easily accessible to everyone and which is the right of every man. Specially, in the Kaliyuga there is no other easy means at all except devotion for the redemption; because in the present time it is very difficult to accomplish the principle of knowledge, Yoga, penance, sacrifice with philanthropic motive etc., and nowadays it is difficult even to find its complementary requisites and proper means also. So man should be bent upon to be earnest for the principle of devotion. If it is taken with thoughtful consideration, it is found that nowadays, mostly the moral persons having faith in religion, prefer the Lord-devotion. Now, it is the matter of consideration for us as what is the Lord and what is His devotion? We must realize the God, who is the ruler of the entire universe, who is omniscient, omnipotent, indweller of everybody’s heart, whose law is justice and moral conduct, who is the witness of all and who is the giver of learning, wisdom and knowledge to all and who in spite of being beyond all the three modes of Prakriti, is the enjoyer of three Gunas. The three modes of Prakriti for play sake, whose devotion purifies the man to the highest purity and relieves him from the demerits, immoral conduct and miseries, who manifests Himself in divine, human etc., all the forms from time to time through His sportive display, despite being unmanifest only to show His mercy to the living beings for their good and for the preaching of religion and to bestow His shelter to His devotees, rather to say that He delights His devotees by blessing them with His direct vision according to their will appearing in the manifested form and who had appeared in the form of Shri Hari in Satyayuga, as Shri Ram in ‘Tretayuga’ as Shri Krishna in ‘Dwaparyuga’. Loving eternal imperishable embodiment of truth, consciousness and bliss, omnipresent that supreme being should be known as God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, ‘what is devotion’ is the main point of discussion. The foremost sage Sandilya has said—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘सा परानुरक्तिरीश्वरे’</span> ‘The exclusive love for God is devotion’. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sage Narad has also mentioned in his ‘Bhakti Sutra—<span class="char-style-override-8">‘सा त्वस्मिन् परमप्रेमरूपा’</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span>(2 )‘The extreme love in the Lord is devotion’. <span class="char-style-override-8">‘अमृतस्वरूपा च’</span><span class="char-style-override-9"> </span>(3 ) ‘And that is the nectar’. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such kinds of more other versions are also worthnoting. On the basis of these versions it is the conclusion that the love to the Lord only is nectar and that is the real devotion. If to say according to the grammar ‘Bhakti’ means service; because the word ‘Bhakti’ is derived from the verbal root—‘Bhaj Sewayam’, it is also appropriate to say. Love is the fruit of service and the last limit of the principle of Lord’s devotion. As the tree has its worth and perfectness only when it bears fruit, in the same way the glory and accomplishment of devotion is in the supreme love in the Lord. Love is its climax and service is performed for the accomplishment of love. So, as a fact, the exclusive love in the Lord is ‘Bhakti’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Although, the right of every living being in the devotion of the Lord is justified, because Hanuman, Jambavant, Gajendra, Garuda, Kakbhushundi and Jatayu etc., all the animals and birds of Tretayuga have attained supreme abode by the virtue of Lord’s devotion but being bereft of knowledge and practice of spiritual exercise among the animals and birds etc., other than mankind fail to secure devotion to the Lord—so the authors of Shastras mention that only a human being is entitled to attain devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the devotion of the Lord age and appearance have no meaning. Knowledge, wealth, caste and vigour are not important and the Lord does not give much importance to even moral conduct and merits,—In His consideration it is only the Love that counts. Any poet has said also— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">व्याधस्याचरणं ध्रुवस्य च वयो </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">विद्या गजेन्द्रस्य का</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">का जातिर्विदुरस्य यादवपते-</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">रुग्रस्य किं पौरुषम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कुब्जाया: कमनीयरूपमधिकं </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">किं तत्सुदाम्नो धनं</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भक्त्या तुष्यति केवलं न च गुणै-</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">र्भक्तिप्रियो माधव:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘What was the morality in the conduct of the hunter? Actually, what was the age of Dhruv? What was the knowledge in Gajendra? What was the pedigree of Vidur? What prowess had the Lord of Yadavas, Ugrasen? What was such a matchless charm in Kubja? What was such a plenty of wealth with Sudama? The devotion-loving Madhav is satisfied only with devotion and not with virtues and merits.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The devotee is endowed with moral conduct and virtues in the natural way by the influence of devotion, so the moral conduct and virtues don’t have so much importance in the devotion of the Lord, but it should not be misunderstood that there is no need of moral conduct and  virtues at all in the devotion of the Lord. For example, a patient of any disease has the main importance of the medicine to be cured from the disease but side by side the regulated diet is also very important, similarly for the cure of the worldly disease of life and death, the devotion of the Lord is the best medicine and the moral conduct and virtues are the diet supplement. For the cure of the worldly disease if the patient does not pay attention towards the regulated diet, despite taking the medicine, generally, he is not cured of the disease but a little lackness in his moral conduct and noble merits, he is cured of the worldly disease by taking the medicine of devotion; because the medicine of devotion does the work of regulated diet also. Not only this but the devotion of the Lord generates the creation of the diet of meritorious qualities and noble conduct also having rooted out different kinds of demerits and vices as obstacles and finally roots out the disease forever. So, the devotion to the Lord is the supreme medicine.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are mainly two kinds of devotion—First the devotion as means which has been named as ‘Ninefold devotion’ (Navadha Bhakti) and ‘Vaidh-Bhakti’ also and the second is the form of accomplishment which has been called by the name of Prema-Premlakshana etc. Here in this devotion ‘Navadha’ is in the form of the means and love is the goal to be achieved. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, it requires to be thought over what is the ‘Vaidh-Bhakti’. Only this much can be said in its answer that to act upon the will of the Lord with the attitude that may please Him, is called the ‘Vaidh-Bhakti’. In the Shastras there are its different characteristics mentioned.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the ‘Ramayan’ written by Tulasidasji, Shri Ramchandraji tells to Shabari—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रथम भगति संतन्ह कर संगा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दूसरि रति मम कथा प्रसंगा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गुर पद पंकज सेवा तीसरि भगति अमान।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">चौथि भगति मम गुन गन करइ कपट तजि गान॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मंत्र जाप मम दृढ़ बिस्वासा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पंचम भजन सो बेद प्रकासा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">छठ दम सील बिरति बहु करमा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">निरत निरंतर सज्जन धरमा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सातवँ सम मोहि मय जग देखा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मोतें संत अधिक करि लेखा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आठवँ जथालाभ संतोषा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सपनेहुँ नहिं देखइ परदोषा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नवम सरल सब सन छलहीना।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मम भरोस हियँ हरष न दीना॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The first in order is association with the saints and the second is marked by a fondness for the episodes of My sports (Lila).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Humble service of the lotus feet of one’s preceptor is the third form of Devotion, while the fourth type of Devotion consists in singing My glories with a guileless heart. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Repeating My ‘Ram Nam’ (Ram formula, <span class="char-style-override-10">मंत्र</span><span class="char-style-override-11">)</span> with unwavering faith constitutes the fifth form of adoration revealed in the Vedas. The sixth variety consists in the practice of self-control and virtue, desisting from manifold activities and ever pursuing the course of conduct prescribed for saints. The seventh type is he who sees the world full of Me, without distinction, and reckons the saints as even greater than Myself. He who remains contented with whatever he gets and never thinks of detecting others’ faults, cultivates the eighth type of Devotion. The ninth form of Devotion demands that one should be guileless and straight in one’s dealings with everyone, and should in his heart cherish implicit faith in Me without either exultation or depression.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">And in Shrimad Bhagavat also Prahladji has said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णो: स्मरणं पादसेवनम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(7/5/23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘To hear the names, praises and stories of Lord Vishnu and chant them, to remember Him (as well as His names and stories), to wait upon Him, to offer worship and salutation to Him, to dedicate one’s actions to Him, to cultivate friendship with Him—These are the nine kinds of devotion.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, in the Shastras different kinds of devotion and different characteristics have been stated; but after minute observation there is no difference in the principle. Generally all have the same intent that to serve and perform the conduct with the attitude that may satisfy Him and to act upon His will, is the service or Devotion. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now a bird’s eye view is being presented about the nine kinds of Devotion, its scope, guideline, purpose, cause, fruit and examples as mentioned by Prahlad in Shrimad Bhagavat. The man who follows even anyone kind out of nine kinds of Devotion with full dedication whole heartedly, attains the supreme abode; and he who follows all the nine kinds properly, there is no doubt about his redemption.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Listening</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To listen to the nectar of fables of the Lord’s Name, form, attributes, influence, manifold activities and mystery as related by beloved devotees of God with love and faith and to be charmed with the love of the Lord like the deer charmed with the sound of lyre; is the form of Devotion. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For the attainment of the above mentioned ‘Listening-Devotion’ to make effort earnestly, to salute the high-souled persons with whole body lying flat with reverence and love and to serve them and to question with guileless heart regularly and to make effort to shape the conduct as mentioned by them, is the method of attaining Devotion by hearing. The Lord has said in the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिन:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(4/34)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Understand the true nature of that Knowledge by approaching illumined soul. If you prostrate at their feet, render them service, and question them with an open and guileless heart, those wise seers of Truth will instruct you in that Knowledge.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the accomplishment of the Devotion by hearing as mentioned by the preceptors to preach it among the Lord-devotees for the exclusive love in the Lord—this is its purpose.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This listening Devotion is difficult to achieve without the company of the exalted souls. Goswami Tulasidasji has also said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बिनु सतसंग न हरिकथा तेहि बिनु मोह न भाग।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मोह गएँ बिनु राम पद होइ न दृढ़ अनुराग॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Except in the company of saints nowhere there is talk of Shri Hari (Satsang), and one cannot be rid of delusion except through such talk. And till one’s delusion is removed, one cannot have deep-rooted affection for Shri Ram’s feet.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But in the absence of the association of the exalted souls, the company of the advanced devotees of the highest category and to go through the volumes written by great men is equally the same as ‘Satsang’. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Without ‘Satsang’ the attachment to the worldly enjoyments is but natural. That is the cause of man’s downfall and by the ‘Satsang’ there is the apparent highest gain; because the company has a great impact on man and the Devotion with hearing is also achieved by ‘Satsang’; because it is only ‘Satsang’ the cause of audible Devotion. Even the vicious man is purified in the company of great souls with their view, speech, touch, contemplation and association. Without the grace of the great souls none can attain the Supreme abode.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In Shrimad Bhagavat, Mahatma Jad Bharat says about the king Rahugan that— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">रहूगणैतत्तपसा न याति </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न चेज्यया निर्वपणाद् गृहाद्वा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नच्छन्दसा नैव जलाग्निसूर्यै- </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">र्विना महत्पादरजोऽभिषेकम्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(5/12/12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Rahugan, one does not attain this consciousness through asceticism nor through Vedic rituals, nor again by dealing out food and other necessaries among the needy, nor by duly performing one’s religious duties pertaining to household life such as entertaining an unexpected visitor, service of the afflicted and poor and so on, nor through a proper study of the Vedas nor through the worship of the gods presiding over water, fire and the sun, nor by any other means except by sprinkling one’s body with the dust of feet of exalted souls.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So, it proves that all the actions are accomplished by the company of great men. In the Shrimad Bhagavat, the Lord says to Uddhava—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">यथोपश्रयमाणस्य भगवन्तं विभावसुम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">शीतं भयं तमोऽप्येति साधून् संसेवतस्तथा॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(11/26/31)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Uddhav! Even as cold, dismay and darkness disappear in the case of a man who betakes himself to the glorious Agni (the god of fire), so do the rigidity and obtuseness, born of stern devotion to duty, the fear of future births and its root, ignorance, get dissolved in the case of the man who renders loving service to pious souls.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अन्नं हि प्राणिनां प्राण आर्तानां शरणं त्वहम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">धर्मो वित्तं नृणां प्रेत्य सन्तोऽर्वाग् बिभ्यतोऽरणम्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(11/26/ 33)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Just as food is life itself to those that breathe, as I am the only shelter to the afflicted, and even as piety is the only wealth for men to depend upon in the other world after death, so saints are the only resort to him who is afraid of being born again and again on this mortal plane. ’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न रोधयति मां योगो न सांख्यं धर्म एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न स्वाध्यायस्तपस्त्यागो नेष्टापूर्तं न दक्षिणा॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">व्रतानि यज्ञश्छन्दांसि तीर्थानि नियमा यमा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">यथावरुन्धे सत्संग: सर्वसंगापहो हि माम्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(11/12/1-2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-5">The glorious Lord began again:</span> ‘Neither Yoga (consisting of eight limbs enumerated in the Yoga-Sutras of Patanjali) nor Sankhya (knowledge of the distinctive character of the different categories discussed in the Sankhya system of philosophy) nor righteousness consisting of non-violence, benevolence etc., study of the Vedas or Japa of the Divine Name, austerity and renunciation nor pouring oblations into the sacred fire and works of public utility such as the digging of wells and tanks and the laying out of gardens nor the bestowal of gifts, observing fasts, worship of gods, muttering secret spells, resorting to holy waters and places of pilgrimage, undertaking sacred observances such as purity of body and mind and the five forms of self-abnegation (non-violence etc.,) gain Me over as does Satsang capture Me—Satsang, which actually puts an end to all other attachments.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The foremost sage Naradji also says— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">‘महत्संगस्तु दुर्लभोऽगम्योऽमोघश्च।’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"><span class="char-style-override-12">(Narad Sutra 39)</span><span class="char-style-override-13"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The association of the exalted souls is scarce, inaccessible and infallible.’ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">‘तदेव साध्यताम्, तदेव साध्यताम्।’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Narad Sutra 42)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Practise the company of nobles, it means to serve, accompany and act upon the commands of the saints—the great exalted persons.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even by the audible-Devotion thus, obtained from the perfect persons, man can attain the Supreme abode—this is its fruit. The Lord has said in Shrimad Bhagavad Gita that—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अन्ये त्वेवमजानन्त: श्रुत्वान्येभ्य उपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तेऽपि चातितरन्त्येव मृत्युं श्रुतिपरायणा:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(13/25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Other dull-witted persons, however, not knowing thus, worship even as they have heard from others (i.e., the Knowers of truth); and even they who are thus, devoted to what they have heard, are able to cross the ocean of mundane existence in the shape of death.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Naradji, too, has said about Sanakadik in Shrimad Bhagavat Mahatmya— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">श्रवणं सर्वधर्मेभ्यो वरं मन्ये तपोधना:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">वैकुण्ठस्थो यत: कृष्ण: श्रवणाद् यस्य लभ्यते॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(6/76)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I account the hearing of Shrimad Bhagavat as the best of all righteous courses, O sages rich in askesis! For through the hearing of it is attained Shri Krishna who dwells in Vaikuntha.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Only by the audible Devotion the Lord is attained. There are so many proofs also in the Shastras and there are available so many examples in the Purans and History also. As the king Parikshit got the supreme abode only by hearing the Bhagvat. It is mentioned in the Shrimad Bhagavat Mahatmya—  </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">असारे संसारे विषयविषसंगाकुलधिय:</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">क्षणार्द्धं क्षेमार्थं पिबत शुकगाथातुलसुधाम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">किमर्थं व्यर्थं भो व्रजत कुपथे कुत्सितकथे</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">परीक्षित्साक्षी यच्छ्रवणगतमुक्त्युक्तिकथने॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(6/100)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O men, whose mind is agitated through attachment to the poison-like pleasures of sense ! Drink the peerless nectar in the form of Shrimad Bhagavat (the story  narrated by Shri Shuk) for your (spiritual) good even for half a second in this unsubstantial world. Why wander for nothing, O friends! on the wrong path resonant with vicious talks? Emperor Parikshit stands as a witness to corroborate the statement (found in our sacred-books) that Mukti (emancipation) follows in the wake of Shrimad Bhagavat entering the very ears.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The wicked and evil doer like Dhundhukari even got salvation only by the influence of hearing the praise and virtues of the Lord and many sages like Shaunak etc., also used to pass their time in hearing the history and Puran—they never felt repleted.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For this human life there is nothing more delightful audible subject than hearing the virtues of God and this is achieved in the company of the great souls. So, there is no other object in this world so delightful and useful like the company of the noble persons for the mankind. Sutji says in the Shrimad Bhagavat—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तुलयाम लवेनापि न स्वर्गं नापुनर्भवम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भगवत्संगिसंगस्य मर्त्यानां किमुताशिष:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(1/18/13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“We cannot compare with a moment’s fellowship of loving devotees of the Lord either heavenly bliss or even final beatitude (the cessation of birth and death) much less the enjoyments sought after by mortal men.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So, we should engage our whole life in the regular hearing of the nectar of the fables of the Lord’s Name, appearance, merits, love, influence, manifold activities, abode, mystery and essence accompanying the great noble men and while hearing, being charmed in the love and joy we should make our human life fruitful.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Congregational singing</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By the repeated pronunciation of the Lord’s Name, form, attributes, glory, character, essence and mystery with love and faith, the horripilation in the body, choking of the throat, fall of tears, exhilaration in the heart, being charmed etc., is the form of the Devotion of congregational singing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To relate the glory and love of the Lord before the devotees through the fables and speeches sitting in a secluded place or in the company with others to mutter His name or singing loudly in His praise having the image of the Lord in the mind, to pronounce the Lord’s attributes, glory and character etc., with faith and love in mild tone or loudly either sitting or standing with or without musical instruments and to make prayer with the hymns in the praise of the Lord, these are the kinds to attain the above mentioned Devotion. But all these actions should be natural with the pure intention being free from ostentation escaping from the ten evils by name.*</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Having achieved the Devotion of Congregational singing to chant divine names so that all people by cultivating divine love may attain God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Devotion of Congregational singing is also got by the grace of the Lord and great souls only. So in this matter their grace only is the factor, because by hearing the Lord’s love, glory, essence and secret from the mouths of the Lord’s devotees and reading the Shastras, the love and faith develops towards the Lord and then, the man can achieve the above Devotion of congregational singing. To be blessed with the grace of the Lord and His devotees, one should abide by their behests.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, only by the Devotion of such congregational singing also, by the mercy of the Lord and with exclusive love in Him, man can achieve Him. In the Gita, the Lord has said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते मामनन्यभाक्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">साधुरेव स मन्तव्य: सम्यग्व्यवसितो हि स:॥ </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Even if the vilest sinner worships Me with exclusive devotion, he should be reckoned a saint, for he has rightly resolved. (He is positive in his belief that there is nothing like devoted worship of God). Speedily he becomes virtuous and attains lasting peace. Know it for certain, Arjun, that My devotee never suffers a fall.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Not only this, the preacher of the Devotion of congregational singing is the dearest to the Lord. The Lord, Himself has said in the Gita— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">य इमं परमं गुह्यं मद्भक्तेष्वभिधास्यति।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">In the Bhagavat and Ramayan etc., all the devotional books, it has been mentioned that by the congregational singing of the Lord’s Name and virtues all the sins are destroyed and the Lord is attained. In the Shrimad Bhagavat it has been said— </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">It proves that the memory of the Lord was intensely dear to Sutikshna. In the same way, there are many names of the devotees of remembering the Lord found in the Shastras, but due to fear that write up may be long one, only a few devotees names are mentioned instead of mentioning the characters of all. As Sanak, Dhruva, Bhishma, Kunti etc., have got the supreme abode by remembering the Lord. Besides this Bhilani of the low caste and Jatayu bird also got salvation by the memory of the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is no other means like the meditation of the Lord’s virtues, glory and love and form in this world as the means of salvation. Generally, the fruit of all the spiritual discipline is the memory of the Lord to get the deliverance from this world very soon. So being bent upon, all efforts should be made to pass the whole life in the meditation of the Lord by the above mentioned methods. Shri Kabirdas has also said—</p>

Those fools who are not of such a temperament presume in vain to make friends with anyone. A friend should restrain his companion from the evil path and lead him on the path of virtue; he should proclaim the latter’s good points and screen he faults; should give and take things without any scruple and serve his friend’s interest to the best of his ability and finding him in distress love him a hundred times more than ever.

In the description of all the nine kinds of Devotions among the names of the devotees mentioned above for examples, it is not so that only one kind of Devotion was developed in them. The names of those devotees have also been included in that kind who had the predominance of that feature in him so in that type devotion his name has been mentioned in the examples.

No blast of greed can ever extinguish this light, which dispels the overpowering gloom of ignorance and the swarms of moths (in the shape of vanity etc.,) keep away from it in a mood of frustration. Nay, vicious propensities like lust, anger and greed dare not approach him in whose heart the gem of Devotion abides. For him venom is transformed into ambrosia and enemies turn into friends; nobody can attain happiness without this jewel. Again; he is never attacked by the terrible mental diseases from which all living beings are grievously suffering. He, in whose heart, the gem of Devotion to Shri Ram abides, cannot have the least woe even in a dream. They alone are paragons of wisdom in this world; who spare no pains to secure the gem.’ </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, a very good reference of Bharatji’s muttering of the Lord’s name and congregational singing of his virtues is found. It is proper for us to imitate similarly as the loving devotee Bharatji used to mutter the Lord’s name and sing the congregational singing of the Lord’s virtues etc.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Being charmed with love to contemplate and remember the Lord’s name, image, merits, glory, manifold pastimes, Tattva and secret and while pondering in this way to be absorbed in the Lord’s form, is the form of the remembrance Devotion. These marks are also found in Bharatji. It was already his nature to contemplate the Lord Shri Ram again and again. He used to dwell upon particularly the supernatural charming form of the Lord Shri Ram endowed with all the virtues. While living in Ayodhya he did already think of the Lord but when he went to Chitrakut to bring back the Lord to Ayodhya, on the way even he remained contemplating the Lord and in Chitrakut he was already enjoying the sight of the Lord Shri Ram apparently. Thenafter when Bharatji returned Ayodhya from Chitrakut he came back contemplating His merits, character and form on the way and reaching Nandigram he passed most of his time in the Lord’s contemplation.</p>

But he was fully confident of the vow of the Lord that He would meet him certainly. On the base of this hope he used to wait for the Lord every moment. The delay in the sight of the Lord was unbearable to him, so being distressed due to separation he himself used to wail with piteous mind.

How is it that the Lord has not turned up? Has He cast me out of His mind, knowing me to be crooked? Ah! How blessed and fortunate is Lakshman who is truly devoted to Shri Ram’s lotus feet. The Lord knew me to be deceitful and perverse; that is why He did not take me along with Him. If the Lord were to consider my doings, there would be no redemption for me even after countless cycles. But being a friend of the humble and most tender-hearted the Lord never takes into account the faults of His devotees. I have a firm conviction in my heart that Shri Ram will surely meet me; for the omens are so propitious.

<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-14-4">4. Devotion of Feet-adoration</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To be charmed in the love of the Lord and forget the self, reverently viewing, serving, meditating and adoring reverently with love and devotion the charming feet and feet dust and sandal of the divine and auspicious metallic idol form or picture or the mental image of the Lord and to take the sip of the nectareal feet-water is called the ‘Feet-adoration’.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These characteristics are also obviously marked in Bharatji. Bharatji is already the master of the ‘Feet-adoration’. Although, Lakshmiji is always engaged in the feet service of the Lord, but we get the lesson of the service and adoration of feet-sandals only from Bharat. Besides this, description of reverence and regard of even feet-dust as done by Shri Bharatji, prior to Valmikiya Ramayan is hardly available anywhere.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Before departure for Chitrakut, the yearning of the service of the Lord’s feet and the exclusive devotion to the Lord’s lotus feet which was present in Bharat’s heart, is supernatural and praiseworthy. When he went to Chitrakut from Ayodhya, wherever on the way, he found the feet-dust of the Lord he was charmed to place it on his head and apply it in his eyes with great reverence, love and devotion. Bharatji Maharaj remained insisting the lord Shri Ram to return Ayodhya from Chitrakut only with the motive to serve His feet. But when the Lord did not agree to come back to Ayodhya at any cost, he prayed to provide him His wooden-sandals as the symbol of His feet-service. Not to sum up here only placing the wooden- sandals on his head he made it the support of his separation period and while coming back from Chitrakut even on the way meditating the wooden-sandals of the Lord’s feet he reached Nandigram. Reaching here, having placed the wooden-sandals on the royal throne; he used to fulfil all the royal affairs after submitting it to them. He considered the Lord’s wooden-sandals as the support-base of his life and used to worship them with great love and devotion. The Valmiki and Adhyatm Ramayan have gone so far to describe that when Shri Ramchandraji Maharaj returned Ayodhya, Bharatji went before Him having placed the sandals on his head. How praiseworthy is the Bharatji’s devotion of feet-service.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shri Bharatji says— </p>

Bowing down low to Shri Ram as though the latter were seated on it, he paid homage to the throne itself and, taking the whisk, sat down on the seat meant for the chief minister.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, serving and adoring in this way Bharatji passed his night. What a marvellous service and adoration is this!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Bharatji came to Nandigram, there having placed the Lord’s wooden-sandals on the throne in place of the Lord, he used to worship the Lord according to the rules of the Shastras with leaves, flowers and scents etc.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Adhyatm Ramayan says— </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Bharat, the son of Kaikeyi, having placed the auspicious wooden-sandals of Shri Ramchandraji on the royal throne used to adore them with sandal stick, flower etc., and thus, the prominent king Bharatji began to live at Nandigram remaining engaged in penance.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shri Tulasidasji has also said—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नित पूजत प्रभु पाँवरी प्रीति न हृदयँ समाति।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मागि मागि आयसु करत राजकाज बहु भाँति॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘He daily worshipped the Lord’s sandals with a heart overflowing with love and affection and constantly referred to them in the disposal of the many affairs of the state.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The worship of the Lord’s idol is found at so many places in the Shastras but having placed the wooden- sandals in place of the Lord and to worship them also with love and devotion—the pioneer preceptor of this teaching was only Shri Bharatji. How admirable is his supernatural worship-devotion! </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the expiry of the period of fourteen years when Shri Ramchandraji Maharaj was coming back to Ayodhya, Bharatji worshipped the feet of Shri Ramchandraji personaly seated in the aeroplane with sacred water for washing the feet according to the ordinance of the Shastras.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्राञ्जलिर्भरतो भूत्वा प्रहृष्टो राघवोन्मुख:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Standing highly rejoiced with joined palms, his face turned towards Shri Ram, Bharat thereupon worshipped Shri Ram (from afar) with offerings of water to wash his hands and feet with and other articles, extending welcome to him in the true sense, Shri Ram’s return being truly welcome to him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, in the stories of Shri Ram there are several places where the worship by Bharatji is found here and there. We should also worship and serve the Lord earnestly considering Bharatji an ideal.</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-14-6">6. Obeisance-devotion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To pay obeisance to the Lord’s form as described in the Shastras, to salute the Lord’s name, the metallic idol of the Lord, His portrait or the image in the mind and to salute with love the Lord’s apparent feet with body and mind with love and devotion and doing so to be sunk in the overflow of the Lord’s love, is ‘Obeisance-Devotion’. Bharatji was perfectly endowed with all these characteristics. What to admire the <span class="char-style-override-6">o</span>beisance-Devotion of Bharatji! When he set out to bring back Shri Ramchandraji, he went away saluting the Lord on the way and reaching Chitrakut he fell down prostrate on the Lord’s feet and he was overwhelmed with pathetic emotion. <br/>Shri Tulasidasji writes— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सखा बचन सुनि बिटप निहारी।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">When the Lord came back to Ayodhya from the woods; Bharatji clinged to His feet; Bharatji did not want to loose his hold of the feet, but the Lord forcibly lifted him and clinged to His heart. At that moment Bharatji saluted Sitaji also and declaring himself guilty, he begged for pardon for his fault from her.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Valmikiya Ramayan, the description is as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ततो विमानाग्रगतं भरतो भ्रातरं तदा।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Bent low with reverence, Bharat then saluted his elder brother, Shri Ram, who stood in the forepart of the aerial car even as one would salute the sun appearing on Mount Meru. Feeling delighted when lifted on to that aerial car and approaching Shri Ram, Bharat of unfailing prowess, greeted him once more. Approaching Lakshman (and embracing him) as also Sita (a princess of the Videha territory), Bharat, the scourge of his enemies thereupon joyously saluted her and mentioned his name too.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Almost like the same description is there in the Adhyatm Ramayan also. There has been mentioned— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आरोपितो विमानं तद् भरत: सानुजस्तदा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राममासाद्य मुदित: पुनरेवाभ्यवादयत्॥ </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘At that time, brother Shri Ram made Bharat along with Shatrughna mount in the plane. On reaching close to Shri Ramchandraji, being overjoyed Bharatji saluted Him again. Then, being overwhelmed with love Bharatji saluted Sitaji pronouncing his name with great love having met Lakshman.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Giving a bird’s eye view of the description of Bharatji’s condition at that time it is described in the Padmapuran as follows— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दृष्ट्वा समुत्तीर्णमिमं रामचन्द्रं स तैर्युतम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हर्षाश्रूणि प्रमुञ्चंश्च दण्डवत् प्रणनाम ह॥ </p>

<p class="TXT-Right">  (Padmapuran, Patal. 2/29, 31, 37-38)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘To see Shri Ramchandraji along with His attendants on the ground that Bharatji shedding tears of joy, laid down prostrate on the earth before Him. In the beginning, he did not rise despite lifting him again and again by the Lord; instead of rising up, he remained bursting to tears continuously holding the lotus feet of Shri Ramchandraji. Thenafter, having taken the sight of the chaste Sita the daughter of Janak, Bharat saluted her with great respect and said—‘Mother! Pardon this fool like me for the fault committed by me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Ramcharitmanas, it has been described as follows— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गहे भरत पुनि प्रभु पद पंकज।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नमत जिन्हहि सुर मुनि संकर अज॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">परे भूमि नहिं उठत उठाए।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बर करि कृपासिंधु उर लाए॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्यामल गात रोम भए ठाढ़े।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नव राजीव नयन जल बाढ़े॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Then Bharat clasped the Lord’s lotus-feet, which are adored by gods and sages, Shankar and Brahma. He lay prostrate on the ground and would not rise even though being lifted up, till at last the all-merciful lovingly took him up and pressed him to his bosom. Every hair on His swarthy form stood erect and His lotus eyes were flooded with tears.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a marvellous condition of love and meekness is! Bharatji was already the idol of love and humbleness. To pay obeisance was his nature. Whenever he met the Lord, he used to salute Him everytime. His this ideal obeisance of Devotion is worth imitating for us.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-14-7">7. Servitude-devotion</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Having the well understanding of the Lord’s virtues, Tattva, mystery and glory to serve Him with love and devotion and to act upon His will and to treat the Lord our master and ourselves as His servant is the ‘servitude-devotion.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This attitude is found in Bharatji at every step. This is his prominent nature. When Bharatji returned to Ayodhya from his maternal uncle’s house, he said to Kaikeyi clearly that he would bring Shri Ram back and become His servant and serve Him. Later on the family priest Vasishthaji and his ministers made their best efforts to make him sovereign but Bharat’s reply was merely that—‘I find neither your good nor mine in this respect. My good lies in His service only. All were charmed to hear Bharat’s bent of mind. With this attitude of mind Bharatji departed for Chitrakut from Ayodhya to bring back the Lord. On the way, wherever he halted his behaviour and discourse gives the glimpse of the same view. In Chitrakut also his feelings of servitude reflect in his every action because he was a living idol of servitude-devotion. Throughout his life he had regarded the service of the Lord and the obedience of His command his best and the highest duty and he thought his highest good lies only in this. In his eye-view there was no other work better than the service of the Lord Shri Ram. Even the hardest order of the Lord was reverentially acceptable to him. Bharatji considered it sin to create the position of embarassment for his Lord. It was only to obey the order of his Lord Shri Ram that he suffered the grief of His separation for fourteen years. Even while discharging the royal duties, his service attitude towards the Lord flashed. When the Lord Shri Ram arrived back after fourteen years of exile, Bharatji handed over His kingdom to His feet and remained engaged in His service and obedience throughout his life. If sometimes He had to move somewhere outside, even there also to serve Him and to enquire of the sermons in his own interest—was his main work. Thus, Bharatji passed his whole life in the servitude of Devotion to the Lord Shri Ram. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord, Himself was charmed with his service- attitude, obedience and with his emotion of love. In this respect his appreciation to any degree is insufficient. Bharatji is the highest ideal of love and humble service. Though the whole conduct and character of Bharatji is the indication of servitude, yet at so many places there is the priority of servitude attitude. Now, a picture of his slavish attitude is being sketched with some main proofs in the following lines—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These are his words for his mother Kaikeyi— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">निवर्तयित्वा रामं च तस्याहं दीप्ततेजस:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दासभूतो भविष्यामि सुस्थितेनान्तरात्मना॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodhya. 73/27)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Nay, having caused Shri Ram to return from the forest, I shall settle down in life with a composed mind, turning a servant of the aforesaid prince of effulgent glory.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Adhyatm Ramayan also there is such reference—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गच्छाम्यारण्यमद्य स्थिरमतिरखिलं </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">दूरतोऽपास्य राज्यं। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">रामं सीतासमेतं स्मितरुचिरमुखं </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नित्यमेवानुसेवे॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Ayodhya. 7/114)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I have firmly decided; leaving the whole royality completely, I will move for the wood just today and serve Shri Ram and Sita daily having a smiling and beautiful face.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bharatji says to the preceptor Vasishtha and his ministers— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हित हमार सियपति सेवकाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सो हरि लीन्ह मातु कुटिलाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘My good lies in the service of Shri Ram, although I have been deprived of that privilege through my mother’s perversity.’</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Undoubtedly, my life will be success if I may get the opportunity to be even the servant of Shri Ram’s servants.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How higher the slavish attitude is!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reaching Chitrakut Bharatji says to the Lord Shri Ram— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अहमप्यागमिष्यामि सेवे त्वां लक्ष्मणो यथा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नो चेत्प्रायोपवेशेन त्यजाम्येतत्कलेवरम्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Adhyatma Ramayan, Ayodhya. 9/39)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Well! If you don’t want to come back from the woods, then allow me that I may serve You like Lakshman accompanying you in the forest; otherwise I will give up this body remaining without food and water.’ What a great insistence Bharatji gives for the Lord’s service!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But recollecting the Lord’s Nature Bharatji again began to say— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अब करुनाकर कीजिअ सोई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जन हित प्रभु चित छोभु न होई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जो सेवकु साहिबहि सँकोची।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">निज हित चहइ तासु मति पोची॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सेवक हित साहिब सेवकाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">करै सकल सुख लोभ बिहाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Now, O mine of compassion, do that only whereby you do not feel perturbed on account of your servant (i.e., myself). A servant who seeks his own gain by placing his master in an embarrassing situation is a mean-minded fellow. A servant will gain only if he serves his master renouncing all his personal comforts and greed.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After the return of the Lord to Ayodhya, whenever Bharatji accompanied Him to any garden or groves, he remained engaged in His service there also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shri Tulasidasji says— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुनि प्रभु बचन भरत गहे चरना।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुनहु नाथ प्रनतारति हरना॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">करउँ कृपानिधि एक ढिठाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मैं सेवक तुम्ह जन सुखदाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘On hearing the Lord’s words Bharat clasped His feet. Listen, my Lord, reliever of the suppliant’s agony: Yet, O repository of compassion, I make bold to make one submission, I being Your servant and You the solace of Your devotees!’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">•••</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हरन सकल श्रम प्रभु श्रम पाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">गए जहाँ सीतल अँवराई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भरत दीन्ह निज बसन डसाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बैठे प्रभु सेवहिं सब भाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The Lord who is reliever of all fatigue, Himself felt tired and retired to a cool mango grove, where Bharat spread his own scarf and the Lord took His seat thereon with all His brothers in attendance.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, Bharatji remained continuously engaged in the Lord’s service. What a praiseworthy is Bharat’s ideal attitude of service! Having pondered over well the character of Bharat, considering his slavish mentality as an idea, we should imitate him.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-14-8">8. Devotion of Friendliness</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Keeping in mind after well understanding the Lord’s influence, <span class="char-style-override-6">t</span>attva, mystery and glory with firm conviction and shape ourselves according to His liking with the friendly attitude, to have exclusive love in Him and being emotionally overwhelmed with His virtues, image and sportive display to remain always gay is the Devotion of friendliness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is the only characteristic; the devotion as a friend lacks in Bharat’s character and conduct; but with the other attitudes and sentiments of Devotion, the devotion as a friend certainly also reflects. As has been described in Valmiki Ramayan, Bharatji says to his mother—</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">यो मे भ्राता पिता बन्धुर्यस्य दासोऽस्मि सम्मत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तस्य मां शीघ्रमाख्याहि रामस्याक्लिष्टकर्मण:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodhya. 72/32)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Pray, announce me soon to Shri Ram, who is unwearied in action, nay, who is my elder brother, father in the absence of the <span class="char-style-override-6">e</span>mperor and friend, all in one, and whose beloved servant I am.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In Chitrakut, Bharatji has said praying to the Lord Shri Ram— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">एभिश्च सचिवै: सार्धं शिरसा याचितो मया।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भ्रातु: शिष्यस्य दासस्य प्रसादं कर्तुमर्हसि॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodhya. 101/12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Solicited by me with bent head in conjunction with these ministers, be pleased to show grace to this servant, who is at the same time your younger brother and pupil.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the above verses with the words pupil, slave, father there is the use of ‘words’ ‘brother’ and ‘kinsman’ also, which is the indication of friendly attitude and to use the word ‘Bandhu’ separately with the word ‘Bharat’ proves clearly the friendly attitude. So, Bharatji had the devotion as a friend also with the feelings of brother, slave and pupil. Due to the attitude of equality in the brotherly attitude also, the friendly attitude reflects. The Ramayan written by Tulasidasji also proves it. These are the words of Bharatji himself— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रभु पितु मातु सुहृद गुर स्वामी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पूज्य परम हित अंतरजामी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Lord You are my father, mother, friend, preceptor, master, the object of my adoration, my greatest benefactor and my inner controller.’</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">•••</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सुहृद सुजान सुसाहिबहि बहुत कहब बड़ि खोरि। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">आयसु देइअ देव अब सबइ सुधारी मोरि॥ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘It is a great mistake to say too much to a loving, intelligent and good master. Therefore, be pleased my Lord, to give your command; for you have accomplished all my objects.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In these stanzas with the use of Lord, father, mother, preceptor, master, object of adoration, benefactor, there is the use of the word ‘friend’ also which has its different meaning from them. So, here, the word ‘friend’ is the indicative of the friendly attitude of Devotion. Undoubtedly, in spite of being of the slavish attitude in Shri Ram mainly, due to brotherhood and love there was the friendly sentiment also.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Shri Ram’s treatment to His brothers also indicates the Lord’s attitude of friendliness with His brothers. Before the departure to the woods at the occasion of preparation for coronation, Shri Ramchandraji considering the equal right of all the brothers in the kingdom says— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">जनमे एक संग सब भाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भोजन सयन केलि लरिकाई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">करनबेध उपबीत बिआहा।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">संग संग सब भए उछाहा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बिमल बंस यहु अनुचित एकू।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बंधु बिहाइ बड़ेहि अभिषेकू॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रभु सप्रेम पछितानि सुहाई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हरउ भगत मन कै कुटिलाई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘My brothers and myself were all born together and together have we dined, slept and played in our childhood; the piercing of our ear-lobes (one of the sixteen sacraments incumbent on a Hindu) our investiture with the sacred thread, wedding and all other ceremonies have been gone through together. The only unseemly practice in this spotless line is that the eldest brother should be installed on the throne to the exclusion of his younger brothers. May this loving and graceful expression of regret on the part of the Lord drive away all evil tendencies from the mind of His devotees.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It reveals Shri Ram’s friendly attitude with all the brothers. Mostly the word ‘friend’ has been commonly used for ‘Lakshman’. The Lord says to Lakshman when he is well ready to accompany Him to the ‘woods’.</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">स्निग्धो धर्मरतो धीर: सततं सत्पथे स्थित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">प्रिय: प्राणसमो वश्यो विजेयश्च सखा च मे॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodhya. 31/10)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Full of affection for me, devoted to virtue, resolute, constantly firm on the right path as shown by the Vedas, dear to me as life, amenable to my control and obedient, you are my born companion too and, therefore, worthy in everyway of accompanying me.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In addition to it there is one verse in the Patal Khand of Padmapuran in which being overwhelmed with the emotion of love Shri Ram has pronounced the word ‘brother’ five times for Bharat. It includes the Lord’s feeling of love and equanimity for Bharat; it indicates the feeling of friendliness.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">‘Approaching near the Lord Shri Ram’s heart came to be so impatient that he at once alighted from the aerial car saying again and again ‘Brother! Brother Bharat!’ repeatedly saying ‘Brother! brother!! brother!!! </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Ramayan written by Tulasidas also there are the references of the Lord’s treatment with Bharat with the feeling of equanimity with due honour.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shri Goswamiji writes— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कृपासिंधु सनमानि सुबानी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बैठाए समीप गहि पानी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘The Ocean of Compassion, Shri Ram, honoured him with kind words and taking him by the hand seated him by His side.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This behaviour of the Lord Shri Ramchandraji Maharaj with Bharat indicates clearly His sentiment of friendliness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, at many places in Shri Ramchandraji’s behaviour with Bharat, there lies the feeling of honour, respect, equanimity and love and that is obviously visible and this points out clearly the glimpse of friendliness. As whenever Bharatji salutes, the Lord embraces him to His heart. This behaviour of the Lord is the indicative of friendliness.</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-14-9">9. Devotion of Self-surrender</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being devoid of ego and the sense of mineness to surrender himself with body, mind and wealth, kin and his all the actions to the Lord with great love and devotion considering every object as the belonging of the Lord is Devotion of self-surrender.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bharatji is no less in anyway in the Devotion of self-surrender; because he considered himself already surrendered to the Lord. In the Ramayan, of Tulasidas, wailing in lamentation pointing out towards his father before Kaikeyi, Bharat says— <span class="char-style-override-5"></span></p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">चलत न देखन पायउँ तोही।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तात न रामहि सौंपेहु मोही॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘I could not see you before you left, nor did you, my father, entrust me to the care of Shri Ram.’’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the similar way it has been described in the Adhyatm Ramayan also— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">हा तात क्व गतोऽसि त्वं त्यक्त्वा मां वृजिनार्णवे॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">असमर्प्यैव रामाय राज्ञे मां क्व गतोऽसि भो:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Adhyatma Ramayan, Ayodhya. 7/66-67)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘O Father! Leaving me in the ocean of sorrow where did you go away? O father, where have you gone without handing me over in the charge of king Rama?’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such repentance of Bharatji proves that he thought himself completely surrendered to Shri Ram.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides this ‘whatever the sovereignty and riches are, the entire belongs to the chief of the Raghus Lord Shri Ram, I, too, belong to Him, so having surrendered the entire to the Lord, I will serve Him’—Keeping in mind this attitude he went to Chitrakut. He left no stone unturned to persuade Shri Ramchandraji to come back but Shri Ramchandraji did not agree at any cost to return and compelled Bharat, instead for the royal administration. ‘To obey the Lord Ram’s order only is your moral duty’—Due to the same consent of Vasishthaji so also taking the support of the Lord’s wooden-sandals in His place, he surrendered the entire including himself to the wooden-sandals of the Lord. On the expiry of the period of fourteen years when the Lord returned Ayodhya, he handed over the kingdom of the Lord lying with him as trust and surrendered his body also to the feet of the Lord. Thinking his highest good in the shelter of the Lord, he remained obeying Him throughout the life. What to talk of any object of the royal state, he did not consider his right even on his own body. Considering the Lord only as his all he used to depend on Him only. All the Shastras as Ramayan etc., are its proof. Some proofs are quoted below as a bird’s eye view. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bharatji says to Bharadwajji— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">मम राज्येन किं स्वामिन् रामे तिष्ठति राजनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">किङ्करोऽहं मुनिश्रेष्ठ रामचन्द्रस्य शाश्वत:॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अतो गत्वा मुनिश्रेष्ठ रामस्य चरणान्तिके।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पतित्वा राज्यसम्भारान् समर्प्यात्रैव राघवम्॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">............................................. </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नेष्येऽयोध्यां रमानाथं दास: सेवेऽतिनीचवत्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Adhyatma Ramayan, Ayodhya. 8/49—51)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Lord! What is my purpose with the kingdom in the presence of the Lord Ram? O the foremost sage! I am forever the slave of Shri Ramchandraji. So, O the best among the Munis! Approaching Shri Ram, lying on His lotus feet having handed over all the objects of the royal kingdom here, I will bring back the lord of Lakshmi Shri Ram to Ayodhya and like the most lowliest slave I will serve Him.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Expressing the emotion of self-surrender Bharatji is saying to Shri Ramchandraji— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">कीन्ह सप्रेम प्रनामु बहोरी।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">बोले पानि पंकरुह जोरी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">नाथ भयउ सुखु साथ गए को।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">लहेउँ लाहु जग जनमु भए को॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अब कृपाल जस आयसु होई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">करौं सीस धरि सादर सोई॥</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">सो अवलंब देव मोहि देई।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अवधि पार पावौं जेहि सेई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He then made loving obeisance and spoke with the lotus palms joined together. “My Lord, I have derived the joy of having accompanied you to the forest and have also obtained the reward of being born in the world. Now, my gracious Lord, whatever be your command, I will bow to it and carry it out with reverence. Pray, vouchsafe to me, good Sir, some tangible support by serving which I may be enabled to live through the end of the term of your exile.” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While staying at Nandigram he is talking to the ministers— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">ततो निक्षिप्तभारोऽहं राघवेण समागत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">निवेद्य गुरवे राज्यं भजिष्ये गुरुवर्तिताम्॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राघवाय च संन्यासं दत्त्वेमे वरपादुके।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राज्यं चेदमयोध्यां च धूतपापो भवाम्यहम्॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Valmiki Ramayan, Ayodhya. 115 /19-20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘“Having restored the kingdom to my elder brother, when re-united with Shri Ram, a scion of Raghu, and thereby laid down the burden of responsibility, I shall then assume the role of a servant of my elder brother. Nay, having given back to Shri Ram, a scion of Raghu, this kingdom, held as a trust till then, as well as the city of Ayodhya and the pair of excellent wooden-sandals, I shall have shaken of the stigma of having been instrumental in bringing about the exile of my elder brother.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then after when Bharatji returned to Ayodhya what Bharatji did is as follows— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">पादुके ते तु रामस्य गृहीत्वा भरत: स्वयम्। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">चरणाभ्यां नरेन्द्रस्य योजयामास धर्मवित्॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अब्रवीच्च तदा रामं भरत: स कृताञ्जलि:। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">एतत् ते सकलं राज्यं न्यासं निर्यातितं मया॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अद्य जन्म कृतार्थं मे संवृत्तश्च मनोरथ:। </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Valmiki Ramayan, Yuddha. 127/54—56)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Taking the wooden-sandals bestowed on him by Shri Ram, Bharat for his part, who knew what is right, himself placed them below the feet of Shri Ram (a ruler of men). Nay, with joined palms the said Bharat spoke as follows to Shri Ram:—“Here is your entire kingdom held in trust by me so long rendered back to you by me. Accomplished of purpose is my birth today and my desire too stands consummated in that I see you, its king come back to Ayodhya.’ </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the Adhyatm Ramayan also somewhat the similar reference is worth noting— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">भरत: पादुके ते तु राघवस्य सुपूजिते। </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">योजयामास रामस्य पादयोर्भक्तिसंयुत:॥ </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">राज्यमेतन्न्यासभूतं मया निर्यातितं तव।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">अद्य मे सफलं जन्म फलितो मे मनोरथ:॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Yuddha. 14/93-94)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Then after, Bharatji got the well worshipped sandals with devotion put on to the feet of Shri Ram’s feet and said—‘Lord! I hand over your royal kingdom given by you to me as trust to you; Today I feel gratified and my life to be fruitful and all my ambitions are accomplished.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In Mahabharat also there is the reference— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तस्मै तद् भरतो राज्यमागतायातिसत्कृतम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">न्यासं निर्यातयामास युक्त: परमया मुदा॥ </p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(Van. 291/65)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Bharatji handed over the empire which was lying to him as trust to Shri Ramchandraji very gladly when He came back to Ayodhya.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Basically, Bharatji’s entire life is the manifestation of self-surrender. His all the performances or actions were for the cause of Shri Ram. The ultimate and ever goal of his life was the love and pleasure of the Lord Ram; because in Bharatji the devotion of love also besides the ninefold devotion was present perfectly. He was the living idol of love. That is why the sage Bharadwajji had said— </p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">तुम्ह तौ भरत मोर मत एहू।</p>
<p class="Shlok-Hindi">धरें देहु जनु राम सनेहू॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘As for yourself, Bharat, my opinion is that you are the very personification of love for Shri Ram.’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In spite of all these Bharatji finds no merit in himself. He considers himself merely sensuous, deceit and crooked. Actually, that is the true self-surrender where there is no trace of vanity of even surrender at all. Everything is surrendered easily and it is thought that there is nothing at all. Bharatji is of such a type.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such men who lead their life following this Bharat’s outstanding devotion of self-sacrifice as an ideal can be blessed ones.</p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-15">Epilogue</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the above lines nine kinds of Devotion have been explained, it should be divided into three parts: the first three—Hearing, Congregational singing and Remembrance are performed in the absence of the deity and the second three—Feet service, Adoration and Obeisance-devotion are performed directly before the Lord Himself on attaining Him; but in absence of the Lord with the attitude of mind regarding as if before sight also these Devotion are performed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These six Devotions are practical to be performed in action. The rest three devotions—Slavish, Friendly and Self-surrender are the form of feeling; because there is the priority to feelings. The emotion of love is inherent in each type of Devotion. So, with the practical form of Devotion primarily involving actions becomes devotion of sentiments if the sentiment is completed with action.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some of the devotees regard the hearing as Satsang, Congregational singing as worship and remembering as meditation; because all these are co-related with them. So all these three have been described as combining them in a group. Here also just like to water the root of the tree, the ‘Satsang’ is the sustainer of chanting and meditation. To practise of anyone of the three, the Lord can be attained, as by hearing Parikshit etc., by chanting Narad etc., and by remembrance Prahlad etc., attained the Lord; then, where does the question of doubt arise to attain the Lord by the practice of all the three as combined?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same way, the service of the feet, obeisance and worship all the three are combined together; because the service, adoration and salutation to the feet of the Lord—all these three are specially related to the feet. To follow anyone of the three, the Lord can be attained as by feet service, the boatman etc., by worship Prithu etc., and by obeisance Akrur etc., attained the Lord; so there is no question of doubt to attain the Lord by following all the three together.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same way the servitude attitude the attitude of friendliness and self-sacrificing attitude—all the three are worth practising with related mind; that is why all these three are co-related. All the three attitudes can be together as well as separately also. With anyone of these attitudes even, the Lord can be attained, as by the slavish attitude Hanuman etc., by the friendly attitude Arjun etc., and by the self-surrendering attitude Bali etc., have attained the Lord; then if the Devotion is performed with all the attitudes together there will be no place for doubt in attaining the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">So we should perform the Devotion of the Lord with great love and Devotion without any motive, earnestly and enthusiastically.</p>
