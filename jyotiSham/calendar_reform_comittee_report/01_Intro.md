## MESSAGE. 

I am glad that the Calendar Reform Committee has started its la bours. The Government of India has entrusted to it the work of examining the different calendars followed in this country and to submit proposals to the Government for an accurate and uniform calendar based on a scientific study for the whole of India. I am told that we have at present thirty different calendars, differing from each other in various ways, including the methods of time reckoning. These calendars are the natural result of our past political and cultural history . and partly represent past political divisions in the country. Now that we have attained independence, it is obviously desirable that there should be a certain uniformity in the calendar for our civic, social and other purposes and that this should be based on a scientific approach to this problem. 

It is true that for governmental and many other public purposes we follow the Gregorian calendar, which is used in the greater part of the world. The mere fact that it is largely used, makes * it important. It has many virtues, but even this has certain defects which make it unsatisfactory 

for universal use. 

सत्यमेव जयते It is always difficult to change a calendar to which people are used, because it affects social: practices. But the attempt has to be made even though it may not be as complete as desired. In any event, the present confusion in our own calendars, in India ought to be removed. 

I hope that our Scientists will give a lead in this matter.

The Calendar Reform Committee was appointed suggested by Dr. Hashim Amir Ali of the Osmania in November, 1952, by the Council of Scientific and University, and Janab Mohammed Ajmal Khan of the Industrial Research (of the Government of India) with Ministry of Education.

place to place. The Indian calendars put up by almanac-makers commit the violation of the following principles of science : 

They take the length of the year to be 365.258756 days (p. 240, Part C of Report) as given by the Saryam Siddhanta about 500 A. D. ; while the correct length of the tropical year, which alone can be used according to the Surya-Siddhanta and modern astronomy for calendarical use, is 365.242196 days. The difference of .01656 days is partly due to errors of observation, not infrequent in those days, and to their failure to recognize the precession of equinoxes. As the Sūrya Siddhanta value of the year-length is still used in almanac-making, the year-beginning is advancing by .01656 days per year, so that in the course of nearly 1400 years, the year-beginning has advanced by. 23.2 days, with the result that the Indian solar year, instead of starting on the day following the vernal equinox, i.e., on March 22, as prescribed in the Sarya Siddhanta (see Chap. V, p. 239), starts on April 13 or 14. The situation is the same as happened in Europe due to the acceptance of 365.25 days as the length of the year at the time of Julius Caesar ; the Christmas Áriginally linked to the winter solstice preceded it by 10 days by 1582 A.D., when the error was rectified by the promulgation of a bull by Pope Gregory XIII. By this, Friday, October 5 was proclaimed as Friday, October 15, and new leap-year rules were introduced. 

Unlike Europe, where the Pope in the medieval times possessed an authority which every one in i Catholic Europe respected, India had a multiplicity of eras and year-beginnings due to her history during the years 500-1200 A. D. But for calendaric calcula tions, our astronomers all over India have been using only the Saka era since Āryabhața (500 A.D.) certainly and probably from much earlier times, and in local almanacs other eras are simply imposed on it. The Calendar Committee has therefore recommended : 

That for all official purposes, the Central as well as State Governments should use the Saka era along with the civil calendar proposed by the Committee (p.6). It is suggested that the change-over may take place from the Saka year 1878, Caitra 1 (1956, March 21). If this is accepted, the last month of the year, viz., 1877 Saka, the solar Phalguna, which has a normal length of 30 days, will have an extra number of 6 or 

(scientific) astronomy evolved by Indian astronomers on the basis of old Indian calendaric conceptions, which were put on scientific basis by blending with them astronomical conceptions prevalent in the West, from the third century B.C. 

The era is also used exclusively for horoscope making, a practice introduced into India since the first century A.D. by the Sakadvipi Brahmanas. 

The Calendar Committee has devised a solar calendar with fixed lengths of months for all-India use, in which it has been proposed to give up the calculations of the Sarya-Siddhanta in which the solar months vary from 29 to 32 days, 

Religious Calendar-The Committee's task resolved itself into a critical examination of the different Indian local calendars, about 30. in number, which use different methods of calculation. This produces great confusion. 

As already stated the Sarya-Siddhanta year being longer than the tropical year by about 24 mins., the Hindu calendar months have gone out of the seasons to which they conformed when the Siddhantic rules were framed ; as a result, the religious festivals are being observed not in the seasons for which they were intended but in wrong seasons. The Committee felt that the error should be corrected once for all and the months brought back to their original seasons. But with a view to avoiding any violent break in the present day practices, the desired shifting has not been effected, but any further increase of the error has been stopped by adopting the tropical year for our religious calendar also (see p. 7). 

Before the rise of Siddhanta Jyotiṣa ( 400 A.D.), India used only the lunar calendar calculated according to the Vedānga Jyotiṣa rules and most religious festi vals ( e.g. the Janmaṣtami, the birthday of Sri Krṣpa) used to be fixed up by the lunar calendar which used only tithi and nakṣatra. The Calendar Committee could not find out any way of breaking off with the lunar affiliation short of a religious revolution and has, therefore, decided to keep them. For this purpose, the lunar year is to be pegged on to the solar year by a number of conventions. The Committee has adhered to the ancient conventions as far as possible. But the erroneous calculations of tithis and naksatras have been replaced by modern calculations given in the nautical almanacs and modern ephemerides, and the religious holidays have been fixed for a central station of India ( ride page 40 ). . The present practice is to calculate the tithi for each locality and the result is that the same tithi may not occur on the same day at all. places. The Calendar Committee has found that the continuance
