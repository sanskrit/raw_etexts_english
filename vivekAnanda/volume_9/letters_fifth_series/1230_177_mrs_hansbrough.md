## CLXXVII

*To Mrs. Alice (Shanti) Hansbrough*

102 E. 58TH STREET,  
NEW YORK,

*3rd July 1900*.

MY DEAR MRS. HANSBROUGH —

This is to introduce Swami Turiyananda. The lady who gave the piece of
land for Vedanta work belongs to Los Angeles. She has taken Turiyananda
with her. He is a great spiritual teacher — but has no experience in
platform work.

The best thing would be to help him to start a centre for quiet and rest
and meditation in the land near San Jose.

With all love to the holy Trinity.[1](#fn1)

Ever yours in the Lord,  
VIVEKANANDA
