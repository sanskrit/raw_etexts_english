By the vajra-like abhichAra of the one who shone like the flash of the
vajra, the opulent mountain of the nanda-s fell root and branch.  
Who alone with his ministerial power \[pun on mantra power\] , which was
like the power of the wielder of the shakti \[skanda\], conferred the
earth on chandragupta, the moon amongst men.  
The one who churned out the nectar of political wisdom, from the vast
ocean of state-craft, to that wise viShNugupta our salutations.  
From the great work of that man, who had explored the limits of
knowledge, we are going to extract and teach in brief the lore, as
promulgated by the knowers of state-craft.
