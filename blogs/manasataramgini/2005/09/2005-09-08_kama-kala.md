Making the bindu to be the face, what is beneath to be the breasts, and
what is still underneath one half of the syllable ha, one meditates on
your manmatha kalA, oh she queen of hara.  
One who does so very easily excites girls; he very soon bewitches the
Triple-world with the sun and moon as her breasts.

The realization of kAmakalA follows from the bijas of the yantra
associated with the mantra: 4 hrIMs enclosed in a circle.

The mAya bIja forms thus:  
1\) Im- the gupta mahAsArasvata bIja which has the bindu forming the
face and the two semi-circular curves the breasts.  
2\) r- the consonant of fire from the 3rd eye on the forehead.  
3\) h- the hakArardhaM, the lower half of ha which is equivalent of the
yoni vowel e. Thus it is the yoni, the root of the manmatha kalA.
