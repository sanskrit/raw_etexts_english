How did we get to this state:

\* [kR^ityA

\* [Battle of
himaprArambha](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/battle-of-himaprarambha.html)  
\* [The 3 front
war](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/11/3-front-war.html)  
We stood there alone waiting for the signal. Suddenly, in the cooling
air we heard a rustle. Our agent arrived from the far end. We were
sensing the moment of the great struggle — would we live or die ? The
outcome was unknown to us as it will occur only in the future, and no
man knows what the future will be. The agent standing at some distance
spoke: “yes the fight is real and you know how you got there. You have
recorded all the steps, with the 2 mAraNa strikes after and the one
before the funerary day in the 5th month of the civil year. You have
journeyed through the various naraka-s after your fall like that of
[yayAtI](http://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/06/preparing-for-worst.html).
But a free man cannot remain long in the state of suppression. He has to
fight– if he dies in the process he is relieved of his suffering. If he
lives he rules the world like yudhiShThira even if he has lost much. But
there are some paths that lead to deeper naraka-s with more suffering be
sane not take those paths again. You have done that before and do not
want to do that again.”

We : “What are they after?”  
The agent said: “They are not like Fourier, who battled only for honor.
They want the hiraNya rukma-s. Fourier only relied on mantra prayoga.
They will try to use all means. One needs to be utterly ruthless in
dealing with them — but beware they can exploit every weakness and
chink. They will be ready to deploy much large forces than during the
khANDavan battle.”

We :”What about the last vIra?”  
Agent: “He will tied up with the mlechCha senA from gajalaNDapura.”
