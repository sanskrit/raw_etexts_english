As we argued earlier the kAlAmukhas were rather orthodox, even if
electic, followers of the Astika path. Their intellectual prelidictions
were rather clear, and they philosophical abilities are also strongly
suggested from what material that survives of the shakti pariShad,
mainly in the Kannada country, and the siMha parishad in the Andhra and
Tamil country. Their Kashmirian precursors were also strongly
intellectual brahmins (the kAshmira paNDitas of the inscriptions) who
originally coexisted with their cousins who were proponents of other
tantric schools like shrikula and trika. This is in contrast with the
stark unorthodoxy of the Lingayatas or vIrashaivas who followed them.

The vaiShNava achArya rAmAnuja in his shrI bhAshya provides a particular
disparaging criticism of shaivas (shri bhAShya ii.2.35-37):  
“Likewise the shaivas state that even men belonging to the non-dvija
ranks can attain brahmaNa-hood and yati-hood by means of certain rites.
It is said : one instantly becomes a brAhmaNa merely by the process of
initiation. A man becomes a yati by undertaking the kapAla vrata.”

Thus, the vaiShNava saint tries to generally dismiss all the shaivas as
being violators of orthodoxy and hence heretics. This is in strong
contrast to the actual behavior of the most orthodox shaiva group the
kAlAmukhas. rAmAnuja accurately records 4 schools of shiva worshippers:
kApAlikas, kAlAmukhas, pAshupatas and shaivas. So, evidently the
vaiShNava polemicist is using the kApAlikas as primary models and guilt
by association to dismiss the shaivas as a group. Similar lists of 4
shaiva sects are found in the purANas and the tantric paddhati of
ishAnashiva.

The vAmAna purANa (6.86-92) in particular states that the:  
1\) shaiva sect as founded by a vasiShTha of the shakti lineage and his
brahmin disciple gopAyana.  
2\) the pAshupatas were founded by a bharadvAja and his pupil the
kShatriya somakeshvara.  
3\) the kAlAmukhas were founded by an Apastamba and his brahmin pupil
krAtheshvara.  
4\) the kApAlikas (mahAvratins) were founded by the vaishya dhanada and
his shudra student arNodara.

Thus, 3 well known shaiva lineages are clearly of Brahminical
provenance, as evidenced by the early texts, the shvetAshavatara
upaniShad, atharvashiras and atharva mahApAshupata vrata grantha. Thus,
the general claim of all shaivas being anti-vedic or anti-brahminical is
patently false. Even more importantly, there is evidence that even the
kApAlikas had a strong brahminical component. This, in any case lays to
rest certain modern and medieaval claims (like that of the learned
tantric polemicist shri lakShmidhara) that brahmins were at loggerheads
with kApAlika or kAlAmukha ways. For example, the brahmin vaisheShika
scholar, named dashapurIyan, from vEDal in Tamil Nad was a kAlAmukha of
hArita gotra and a practioner the taittirIya school (Rangacharya’s
collection of stone inscriptions from Tamil Nad).

In this context we should point out an important inscription brought to
my notice by R.  
The inscription from Nirmand village in the Kangra district in Himachal
Pradesh states that the king sharvavarman installed a li\~nga of
kapAleshavara in around 576-580 AD. His successor samudrasena in the
600s provided the nirmaNDa agrahAra to a school of atharvavedic brahmins
for preserving the atharvaNa shruti and maintaining the kApAla rites.
Thus, pointing out to relatively early associations of brahmins with the
kApAlika stream.

Finally, we look at the root sources of the tantric worship of shiva.
This escathology proposes that 5 streams of tantras emerged from the 5
faces of shiva:  
bhuta tantras: sadyojAta  
vAma tantras: vAmadeva  
bhairava tantras: aghora  
gAruDa tantras: tatpuruSha  
siddhAnta tantras: IshAna  
The 28 tantras = 10 shivAgamas and 18 rudrAgamas form the siddhAnta
tantras which are followed by the sect called shaiva by rAmAnuja and the
other middle period sources.  
The 32 bhairava tantras are the tantras of the kApAlikas (but not the
kAlAmukhas). The bhairava tantras include the most terrifying Agamas,
like the ghoraM, bhImaM, vetAlamardanaM and kapAlaM, from the
abhichArika rites of which there is little chance of escape.

The kUrma purANa clarifies that the pAshupatas were smArta brahmins or
kShatriyas. They actually followed the institutes of the veda and the
dharma shAstras. Thus, we may conclude that within the shaivas the
dominant force were Brahmins, though there was considerable diversity
within them.
