title = "kAlikA purANaM"

+++
With the holy nine nights under way we decided to talk about the kAlikA
purANa. It may be considered a mixture of traditional purANa and a
tantra shAstra manual. The purANa part is dominant in the first 45
chapters of the text. The tantra-shAstra portion with a clear spatial
connection to the yoni pITha of kAmAkhyA is seen in the remain 45
chapters. Together, the 90 chapters contain 8394 shloka-s. The story
frame is in the form of the brAhmaNa-s questioning the bhArgava
mArkaNDeya, who in turn narrates the stories as his is usual custom. In
the later half it becomes a discourse between sagara and his preceptor
the bhArgava aurva.

Chapter 1 contains an account of the emergence of uShA and kAma from
brahmA.  
Chapter 3 contains a description of the charms of rati.  
Chapter 4 contains a description of vasanta.  
Chapter 5 contains a description of how viShNumAyA is invoked by brahmA
to delude rudra. She is described as yogamAyA. This description is
consistent with ekAnaMshA seen in the harivaMsha and they are the same
continuous deity. She rides on a lion and has a deadly sword, is dark of
complexion like a mass of collyrium and has untied, free-flowing long
hair. She is hence kAlI and thus the purANa acquires its name kAlikA as
it goes on describe her glories.  
Chapter 6 contains the account of shiva’s gaNa-s and also has a notable
stava of kAlikA.  
Chapter 7-18 contains the satI cycle. It begins with rudra being primed
for the life of a gR^ihasta by kAma, followed by dakSha invoking
mahAmAyA to be born as his daughter satI and the marriage of satI to
shiva. Then dalliance of shiva and satI, followed by the dakSha yAga
events leading to the death satI and the destruction of dakSha’s yAga.
The final part narrates the emergence of the shakti-pITha-s from satI-s
a\~Nga-s. The peculiar twist of the kA.P is that brahmA, viShNu and
Saturn enter into satI-s corpse and break it up into pieces. The
involvement of Saturn in the tale suggests its relatively recent
provenance.  
Chapter 19-23 brahmA narrates various tales to rudra like that of
arundhati the wife of vasiShTha, the conflict of dakSha and chandra over
his nakShatra daughters, origin of tIrtha-s like chandrabhAga and
shipra.  
Chapter 24-29 material typical of the sarga section of purANa. Chapter
25 mentions the origin of the varAha.  
Chapter 30 contains a stuti of viShNu, followed by shiva assuming the
sharabha form to battle the varAha. sharabha defeats the varAha  
Chapter 31 contains the famous paurANIc motif of the origin of various
yaj\~nA\~Nga-s from the different parts of the varAha (parallels an
orthologous paragraph in many texts).  
Chapter 32-35 more sarga material, the mastyAvatara of viShNu, episodes
of unexpected pralaya-s, recovery of the world after such a pralaya and
rudra relinquishing the sharabha form after saving the world from the
varAha-s ravages.  
Chapter 36-40 The partial cycle of naraka: His birth from the varAha and
pR^ithivi, his coronation in pragjyotiSha, his tapasya to obtain power
and his rise to stupendous power.  
Chapter 40-45 The pArvatI cycle: The birth of kAlI as pArvatI to
himavAn, the attempt of kAmadeva to delude shiva and his destruction,
pArvatI’s tapasya and encounter with shiva coming to test her and their
marriage.

The uttara-kANDa or the tantric manual section of the kAlikA purANa
comprises the remaining part of the text. It is a collection of vidhi-s
and prayogas fitted into the narrative of aurva to student king
sagara.  
Chapter 46 The narrative of the emanations of bhairava-s and vetAla-s
from rudra. It also contains a stava to sha\~Nkara.  
Chapter 47-50 The incarnation of shiva and umA as chandrashekhara and
tArAvatI. It narrates a bizarre tale of how shiva and pArvatI fought and
pArvatI ran away from him. shiva saw sAvitrI and thought it was umA and
went to her full of passion. She cursed him to be born as a man. To get
back to shiva, umA incarnated as tArAvatI. However, chandrashekhara and
tArAvatI did not remember that they were respectively the deva and devI.
A lecherous brahmin named kapota tried to have sex with tArAvatI when he
saw her coming out of a river after a swim. She evaded him by sending
her sister, but he figured it out and laid a spell on her that she would
be violated by a hideous bone-ornamented being. She mentioned this to
chandrashekhara, who tried to protect her by placing her on high
terrace. But duly, rudra assuming his original form inseminated her and
two terrifying vAnara-headed bhUta-s were born to tArAvatI.
chandrashekhara thought that a demon had raped his wife but a brAhmaNa
informed them it was shiva and he himself was shiva. They closed their
eyes and realized their sAyujya with the shivau. But once they opened
their eyes they continued life as a mAnava-s. They had an additional 3
sons whom chandrashekhara favored over the original two vAnara-faced
sons. But it was they who became bhuta-gaNeshvara-s of rudra’s hordes.

unclean mlechCha-s and shiva would become mlechCha-priya. He cursed
ugratArA that she would only receive vAmAchara worship. As a consequence
the whole of kAmarUpa was occupied by barbarous mlechCha-s and the
pA\~ncharAtra tantras were lost in the land. Instead the vAmAchara
