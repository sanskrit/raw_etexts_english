*To the Hindu Students of Trichinapally*[1](#fn1)

\[*February 16, 1897*\]

GENTLEMEN,

I have received your address with great pleasure and sincerely thank you
for the kind expressions contained therein.

I much regret, however, that time effectually prevents my paying even a
short visit to Trichinopoly at present. In the autumn, however, I
propose making a lecture tour throughout India, and you may rely upon it
that I shall then not fail to include Trichinopoly in the programme.

Again thanking you, and with my blessings to all.

Sincerely yours,  
VIVEKANANDA.

1.  [^](#fn1_1)A deputation consisting of Messrs. K. S. Krishnamachari
    and S. M. Raja Ram waited upon Swami Vivekananda in the "Nilgiri
    Hall", Kumbhakonam, with a memorial signed by about 750 students
    (representing the students' population of Trichinopoly) requesting
    the Swami to stay at least one or two days. This was the reply given
    by Swami Vivekananda. It was published in the Madras Standard of
    February 16, 1897.
