## CIV

SAAS-GRUND, SWITZERLAND,  
*25th July, 1896*.

DEAR MRS. BULL,

I want to forget the world entirely at least for the next two months and
practice hard. That is my rest. ... The mountains and snow have a
beautifully quieting influence on me, and I am getting better sleep here
than for a long time.

My love to all friends. 

Yours etc.,

VIVEKANANDA.
