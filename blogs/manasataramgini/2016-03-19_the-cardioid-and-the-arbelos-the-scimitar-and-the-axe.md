title = "The cardioid and the arbelos: the scimitar and the axe"

*The arbelos of Archimedes,*  
*an object most wondrous;*  
*it brought pleasure to us,*  
*when stalked by enemies,*  
*as the old yavana by Romans,*  
*who ended for good his days.*

*What is the mystery of the scimitar and the axe which are worth the
same?*

In the 10th year of our life we became fascinated by the curves
generated by the reflections of various utensils (and the water in them)
in the kitchen. Being no Maxwell, we did not get far enough to develop a
good theoretical understanding of the caustic curves as he had done
around that age. But we did get some empirical feel for how most of
these curves have a point (i.e. a cusp) where they become
undifferentiatable. One of these was the cardioid. Playing with a device
known as the spirograph, which immensely captivated us as a kid, we
quickly discovered for ourselves that the cardioid could be constructed
as the first integer epicycloid. About four years later we were
interested in all manner of classic curves, beyond the obvious circle,
appearing in biological forms. We observed appearances of the limacon in
very disparate biological entities: 1) It appeared as the inner dark
blue pattern on the peacock’s feather. 2) It was the outline of the
cells of certain algae belonging to the pyramimonad clade. This got us
interested in how a cardioid might emerge in biological systems, naively
reasoning that it might form at the intersection of two signals moving
along linear paths. It was then that we discovered for ourselves that
the cardioid was the locus of the foot of the tangents to circle c from
a point P on it.

This then lead to our realization of an interesting relationship between
the area of the cardioid and the generating circle c. Moreover, at that
point we were enamored by the empirical recovery of the interesting
relationship between the excess area of the cardioid with respect to the
generating circle and the symmetric arbelos of that circle.

All this can be geometrically proved with minimal fuss by means of what
has been termed a visual calculus discovered by the Armenian physicist
named Mamikon. The foundation of this method pertains to forming a
tangent cluster, namely the collation of all the tangent segments by
bringing them together to a common point of origin by the translation
transform (This is illustrated below).

![mamikon](https://manasataramgini.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/mamikon.png?w=640)

Generalizing from the above, the basic theorem of Mamikon states that
the area under the tangent segment sweep of a curve is equal to the area
of the equivalent tangent cluster formed by collating the tangent
segments to a common point of origin. Intuitively, since the tangents
define the derivatives to the curve at a given point, the geometric
construction of their collation to form the tangent cluster is
effectively the visual equivalent of integration. Mamikon apparently
first discovered this by studying the well known problem of the area of
the circular ring (illustrated below). The area of the ring can be
expressed using just the length of the tangent segment of the inner
circle bounded by the outer one, independently of the radii of the inner
and outer circles. The sweep of this tangent segment, which forms the
ring, results in a tangent cluster which defines a circle with radius
equal to the tangent segment. Thus, the area of the ring is equal to the
area of that circle which has radius equal to the tangent segment. Thus,
the Mamikon theorem also implies the bhujā-koṭi-karṇa nyāya (known in
the west as the Pythagoras theorem).

This method of Mamikon can now be used to determine the area of the
cardioid. As can be seen from the below construction:

1\) The sweep of the tangent segments of the generating circle c as
formed by the intersection with their feet (i.e. perpendiculars dropped
to them from the point P) defines the cardioid.  
2\) Now by transforming the tangent segments into a tangent cluster we
get locus
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1").  
3\) By definition of foot of tangent ![\\angle PCB' =
90^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cangle+PCB%27+%3D+90%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\angle PCB' = 90^\\circ"); ![\\therefore \\angle PCB' = \\angle PDA =
90^\\circ](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+%5Cangle+PCB%27+%3D+%5Cangle+PDA+%3D+90%5E%5Ccirc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\therefore \\angle PCB' = \\angle PDA = 90^\\circ").  
4\) ![\\therefore \\stackrel
\\frown{ADP}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctherefore+%5Cstackrel+%5Cfrown%7BADP%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"\\therefore \\stackrel \\frown{ADP}") should be a semicircle and locus
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1") a circle.  
5\) Thus by Mamikon’s theorem the area of the claw of the cardioid
PCP’B’= area of circle
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1")  
6\) We can see from the construction that the longest tangent segment,
i.e. diameter of circle
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1"), is equal in length to the radius of circle c. Thus , we get
![Rc\_1=
\\frac{1}{2}Rc](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Rc_1%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DRc&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Rc_1= \\frac{1}{2}Rc")  
7\) Thus area of circle
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1") one fourth area of circle c: ![Ac\_1= \\frac{1}{4}Ac=
\\pi\\frac{(Rc)^2}{4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Ac_1%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7DAc%3D+%5Cpi%5Cfrac%7B%28Rc%29%5E2%7D%7B4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"Ac_1= \\frac{1}{4}Ac= \\pi\\frac{(Rc)^2}{4}").  
8\) Likewise, the mirror image claw of the cardioid has the same area.
We can construct that area as an equivalent circle
![c\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_2") by reflecting circle
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1") on the X-axis.  
9\) Thus, the arbelos PBP’A has the same area as circle
![c\_1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_1"), circle
![c\_2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"c_2") and the claw of the cardioid PCP’B’  
10\) Thus, the area of the cardioid ![=
\\pi(Rc)^2+2(\\pi\\frac{(Rc)^2}{4})=\\frac{3}{2}\\pi(Rc)^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+%5Cpi%28Rc%29%5E2%2B2%28%5Cpi%5Cfrac%7B%28Rc%29%5E2%7D%7B4%7D%29%3D%5Cfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%5Cpi%28Rc%29%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=333333&s=0
"= \\pi(Rc)^2+2(\\pi\\frac{(Rc)^2}{4})=\\frac{3}{2}\\pi(Rc)^2")  
Hence, the cardioid has 50% excess area over the generating circle.

If the claw of the cardioid were a scimitar and and the arbelos an
axe-head we get a scimitar with same surface are as an axe-head.
