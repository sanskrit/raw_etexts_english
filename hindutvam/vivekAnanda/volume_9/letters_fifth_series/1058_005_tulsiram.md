## V

(Translated from [Bengali](b6045ae9005.pdf) )

*To Tulsiram Ghosh*

GHAZIPUR

*10 May 1890*

DEAR TULSIRAM:[1](#fn1)

A basket of roses will be sent to you in a few days at Chitpur. Do you
please send them up immediately to Shashi \[Swami Ramakrishnananda, at
the Baranagore Math\]. They would not be sent to the care of Balaram
Basu, for there would be such nice delays and that would be death to the
flowers. I think if sent to Chitpur, to your depot, it would reach you
there at the very place; if not, write sharp. Baburam \[Swami
Premananda\] is here, going up in a day or two to Allahabad. I too am
going off from this place very soon. I go perhaps to Bareilly and up.
What is Balaram Babu \[Balaram Bose\] doing?

My Pranâms etc. to you all.

Yours affectionately,  
NARENDRA
