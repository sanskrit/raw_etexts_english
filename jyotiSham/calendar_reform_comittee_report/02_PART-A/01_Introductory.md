In India there is at present a terrible calendar confusion. 



For official purposes, India has been using the Gregorian calendar since the imposition of the British rule in 1757. As the Gregorian calendar, on account of historic reasons, has attained the status of a World Calendar, it is still being used for official purposes after the attainment of Independence. There is a proposal sponsored by India before the UNO for the intro duction of a new World Calendar for civil and administrative purposes in place of the Gregorian calendar, which is inconvenient and unscientific (vide C $2.7). 



During the period of Moslem supremacy (1200-1757), the lunar Hejira calendar had been used. both for administrative as well as for Moslem religious purposes, except for a short period (1556-1630), when on the initiative of the Emperor Akbar, its use was prohibited and a form of the Iranian solar calendar (the Jelali calendar), under the name Tarikh Ilāhi, was intro duced. The Hejira calendar is now used only by the followers of Islam for fixing up the dates of their religious festivals. 



Before the advent of Moslem domination, the different states of India used a bewildering variety of calendars for civil as well as religious purposes of which a detailed account is given in C $5. The inscriptions of Indian kings from the first century A.D. to medieval times are dated according to these calendars, and it is often a headache for the Indologist to find out the starting point of the eras used in these calendars. 



Most of these calendars have gone out of use for civil purposes, but some are being still used for fixing up the dates and moments of religious festivals of communities following different. schools of Hinduism and other religions having their origin in India (Buddhism, Jainism). They use different eras, different year-beginnings, and sometimes different methods of calculations based on the three Siddhantas (scientific astronomical treatises), viz., the Sūrya, the ārya, and the Brahma, all dating from ancient and medieval times. 



These practices often produce a bewildering confusion in fixing up dates and moments of observance of the religious festivals, of which some detailed examples are given later. The Calendar Reform Committee was asked to make a study of the various Hindu religious calendars, and recommend to the Government a Unified National Calendar for Hindu religious purposes for the whole of India. The Committee has now finished its labours, and presents its report to the Government. The main points are summarized below: 



The Hindu religious calendar is mainly luni-solar, i.e., the seasons are fixed by the solar calendar, while the dates and moments are fixed according to the lunar calendar pegged on to it. 



The calendar therefore depends on the science of astronomy which has evolved methods for correctly predicting the positions of the sun, the moon, and the planets (the Ephemerides). The astronomical part of the calculations should be the same for calendars used by all nations. But this is not the whole story ; for the calendar also depends on convention, which varies widely from country to country and from state to state. 



Let us give some idea of the Science as well as of the Conventions in use for the solar and the lunar calendars respectively. For the solar calendar : 



- (1) The year should be properly defined, and the year-length taken should be astronomically correct. 

- (2) The seasons should be properly defined, and should start on proper dates. 

- (3) The day should start from midnight. 



An examination of Chap. XIV of the Surya Siddhānta (vide C$ 5.6) shows that the author of this famous treatise accepted these principles and laid down the following rules for the compilation of a calendar : 



- (1) The year should start from the instant when the sun crosses the vernal equinoctial point and the length of the year should therefore be tropical (sāyana). 

- (2) The seasons should consist of two solar months, each defined by the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the sun's path (the ecliptic). 

- (3) The day should be from midnight (ardharātråka system) for purposes of astronomical calculations. 







These principles do not alone suffice to define the calendar, for the year does not consist of a whole number of days, but its length (length of the tropical year) is approximately 365.2422 mean solar days. The time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of the arc of the ecliptic varies from 29.44 days to 31.46 days. 



The Calendar Committee has tried to rectify this fundamental error, by recommending, as laid down by the Sūrya Siddhānta, that the year should begin on the day after the vernal equinox, and the year-length should be sāyana. 



For civil purposes, both the year and the month should consist of a whole number of days, and the civil day ( sāvana ), according to Hindu religious practices, should start from sunrise. To achieve these purposes, different conventions have been used in different states which account partly for calendar confusion ( vide C 85:6). 



But the most serious mistake has been in the length of the year taken by the Sūrya Siddhānta, a standard astronomical compilation having its beginning from the 4th century A.D. The year-length adopted is 365.25876 days, which is presumably sidereal, but even then the length is wrong by + 0.00240 days. But as is pointed out in C $ 56, the Sarya Siddhanta lays down definitely that the year-length should be tropical which, according to modern measurements, should have approximately 365.2422 days, but this rule has been misinterpreted. 



The mistakes in astronomical constants (e.g., in the fixing up of the length of the year or months) are common in all ancient astronomical treatises, whether Indian or occidental, but in the West, the correct values were obtained later by refined observations during medieval times and were then adopted for calendar calculations by edicts of dictators like Julius Caesar or Pope Gregory XIII on the advice of astronomers. In India, astronomical observations stopped from about 1200 A.D. after the advent of the Turkish invaders, when Indian observatories were either destroyed or abandoned by the astronomers and calendar making fell into the hands of astrologers, who had to depend on ancient treatises. 



But a far more potent cause for the adherence to the wrong value was the failure, on the part of the Indian astronomers, to grasp the real nature of the phenomenon of Precession of Equinoxes (vide C $ 4:10). In this, they were not alone, for the false notions about this phenomenon were not abandoned even in Europe till the advent of Newton (1687). 



The Indian year is thus longer than the tropical year by 0.01656 days, and this error has been accumulating for nearly 1400 years with the result that the solar year, instead of starting on the day following the vernal equinox (21st March) as it did in the time of Varahamihira starts nearly 23-24 days later. Thus the year beginning as laid down by our almanac-makers has lost all connection with the actual year-beginning (the day following the vernal equinoctial day) as contemplated by the Sūrya Siddhanta, and the festivals as given by the Indian almanacs are being celebrated very frequently in wrong seasons. If Sarat Pūrimā is celebrated in the Hemanta season, as would happen in the year 1955, it is obvious that our almanacs are following neither the Scriptures nor Science. 



## LENGTHS OF THE SOLAR MONTHS : 



The Hindu solar month-lengths vary from 29 to 32, as the time of passing 30° of the ecliptic varies, accord ing to older data given in the Sarya Siddhanta from 29.32 days to 31.64 days. These varying lengths, as is well-known, can be understood only from Kepler's first two laws, which were explained fully by Newton in 1687 on the basis of dynamics and law of universal gravitation, but these laws and their explanation were unknown to astronomers in 400 A.D. Further these month-lengths are different in the three Siddhāntas be cause they were calculated according to three different formulæ. On account of the ignorance of Kepler's laws. and of the shift of the equinoctial lines in the Earth's orbit ( vide C $ 5:6) the ancient astronomers probably assumed that the times of passage through 30° as calculated according to formulæ given by them would be valid for all times. But we now know this assumption to be incorrect, and cannot stick to the lengths as given in the Siddhantas, which also differ amongst themselves. 



Further, all the numbers expressing month-lengths are fractional, and different states, vix., Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nad use different conventions for defining the day of the solar saṁkrānti ( vide C $ 5:6) i.e., the civil day (sunrise to sunrise) which should be regarded as the day when the sun passes successive 30° of arc, beginning from the Hindu zero-point. The different conventions have their own merits, let the orthodox Bengalee, Oriya, or Tamil Pandit argue it out amongst themselves, but we feel that a convention which makes the solar month vary from 29 to 32 is very inconvenient for civil life, and we are quite sure that if the authors of the Siddhāntas were aware of Kepler's Laws and the shifting of equinoctial lines on the Earth's orbit, they would never have prescribed rules which would make the number of days in a solar month vary from 29 to 32. We have, therefore, assigned lengths of 30 and 31 days to the months. But the moment of the sun's traversing any multiple of the 30th degree from the vernal equinoctial point has been indicated.



We have recommended the SAKA era, as this is the era par excellence used by all Indian astronomers, and had been used and is still used for calendaric calculations all over India, since the days of the Ujjain astronomers (first century A.D.). This is the only era used in all Indian scientific treatises. For other eras see C $ 5.8. 



The new solar calendar is scientific, applicable to all parts of India, and follows the Sūrya Siddhānta in all essential points, and is absolutely sound as regards its astronomical basis. The conventions have been revised with the sole object of having a uniform system for the whole of India. 



## THE LUNAR CALENDAR : 



The lunar calendar depends on the correct calculation of the moments of conjunction (Amāvasyā), opposition (Paurnamāsi) and of the tithis (i.e., the moments when the moon gains 12° or its integral multiple on the sun). The Indian calendar-makers use for this purpose the formulæ on lunar motion given in the three Siddhāntas. But as these are known to be inaccurate, they use certain corrections called bīja introduced by later Indian astronomers. 



It is now well-known that the motion of the moon is very irregular and complex, and therefore the moon is very inconvenient as a time-marker. For this reason the moon was completely discarded by the Egyptians as a time-marker 3000 years before Christ. The ancient Egyptian solar calendar is the basis from which the present Gregorian calendar has sprung. 



But other ancient and modern nations did not follow the Egyptians, and it became the chief duty on the part of their astronomers to observe the moon from day to day, and evolve mathematical formula from which the ephemerides of the moon could be calculated. As Neugebauer has shown (Exact Sciences in Antiquity), ancient Babylonian astronomy (700 B.C. 300 B.C.) was largely centred round devising, , from actual observations of the moon's position, mathematical formulæ, which would enable them to calculate the longitude of the moon in advance. These attempts were continued by the Greeks, Indians, Arabs and medieval Europeans and are still being continued. For the calculation of the moon's position, formulæ are employed which require' twenty pages of printed matter, containing about 1,500 terms in all. They have been evolved as measurements have become more refined and accurate, with the progress of astronomy ; and were, of course, unknown to astronomers of ancient times. 



## Effect of Indian Lunar Calendars



As the orthodox Indian calendar-maker still uses the old formulæ dating from 400 A.D., his calculations of the ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanacs, which are based on modern formulæ and are verified by actual observations as shown in the following example: 



(Original pdf here contains a list of discrepencies in tithi boundaries)



Some of the Indian calendar-makers are aware of these discrepancies, and give the ending moments of tithis according to the Nautical Almanac. But all of them give the moments of beginning and ending of lunar and solar eclipses according to the Nautical Almanac, as times calculated according to the Siddhantas may be grossly inaccurate, and the mistakes would at once catch public attention and lower their prestige. In the words of one of our colleagues (Dr. Gorakh Prasad), these almanac-makers are like bicycle-riders riding without lamps, who get down from their cycles on street corners, just to avoid being caught by the Police. 



The calculations of tithis given by the Calendar Committee follow the Nautical Almanac, and are based on correct positions of the moon and the sun. 



The Committee has made another radical departure. According to conventions laid down in Dharmaśāstras, a religious festival is to be observed in a locality when the prescribed tithi is current at a particular hour of the civil day of that locality. But on the same day and hour, the tithi may vary from locality to locality and this, taken with the mistakes in calculating tithi according to ancient methods, may produce a day's difference in fixing up the dates of religious festivals. 



If the different almanac-makers calculate the tithi not according to the Nautical Almanac, but according to different Indian astronomical treatises, the moment of the tithi may differ by as much as five hours, and the same festival, say the Dussera (or Durga Pujā) may be fixed on two successive days in the same city, as happend in Calcutta in the case of Durga Pujā in 1952 and Sarasvati Puja in 1953. Which set of Pandits is to be followed by the Government in fixing up the date of holidays in such cases ? 



The Committee has taken the view that the ending moments of tithis should be given according to modern calculations (which would naturally agree with Nautical . Almanacs) and the tithi current for the Central Station ( 82.5° E. Long. and 23° 11' N. Lat.) should be the tithi for the whole of India. This is a very sensible proposition, for if we have to follow the Siddhāntic convention to the letter, then even if the calculations are given correctly, every station would have its own tithi, just as according to Relativity, every moving particle has its own time. But the Pandits are not correct in their own claims that they are following the Sāstras correctly ; for a Banaras almanac is according to Siddhāntic convention, true only for Banaras, but may on certain occasions, be incorrect for a place even a mile from Banaras. So the Siddhāntic convention was laid down in an age when there was no printing presses and no printed almanacs, but almanacs were to be fixed up and recited for every locality by local astrologers according to their own calculations. If it has still to be followed, every village should print its own almanac. In laying down the principle that the whole of India should follow the tithi calculated for a central locality, we are no more violating the Siddhāntic convention than the calculators of the Banaras or Calcutta almanacs which have currency over wide areas far away from their own city. 



In course of fixing the festivals of different states in the Reformed Calendar, it has been found that different conventions are followed in different states in the matter of fixation of the same festival. For example it may be quoted that in 1954 Janmāṣtami was observed on the 21st August in North India and on the 20th, 21st and 22nd in other parts of India. Rāmanavami was observed in Bengal on 24th March, 1953, while it was celebrated on the preceding day in upper India. The calculation of the ending moment of tithi is not the cause for such discrepancies in this case, but the difference in convention is solely responsible. We have followed all these differences of conventions in the state-wise fixation of the dates of festivals, as far as practicable. We are however of opinion that a uniform convention should be followed throughout India in this matter also. In order to explore the possibilities of such unification, it is desirable that necessary steps should be taken by the Government. The Ephemerides Committee which we have recommended may be entrusted with this work.
