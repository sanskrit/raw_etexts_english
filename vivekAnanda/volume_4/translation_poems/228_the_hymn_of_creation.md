## THE HYMN OF CREATION

(*Rendered from [Bengali](6207.pdf)* )

One Mass, devoid of form, name, and colour,  
Timeless, devoid of time past and future,  
Spaceless, voiceless, boundless, devoid of all —  
Where rests hushed even speech of negation.[1](#fn1)

From thence, down floweth the river causal,  
Wearing the form of desire radiant,  
Its heaving waters angrily roaring  
The constant roar, "I am", "I am".

In that ocean of desire limitless,  
Appear shining waves, countless, infinite,  
Oh, of what power manifold they are,  
Of what forms myriad, of what repose,  
Of what movements varied, who can reckon?

Millions of moons, millions of suns,  
Taking their birth in that very ocean,  
Rushing headlong with din tumultuous,  
Overspread the whole firmament, drowning  
The points of heaven in light effulgent.

In it arise and reside what beings,  
Quick with life, dull, and lifeless — unnumbered,  
And pleasure and pain, disease, birth, and death!  
Verily, the Sun is He, His the ray,  
Nay, the Sun is He, and He is the ray.

    described in any positive way.
