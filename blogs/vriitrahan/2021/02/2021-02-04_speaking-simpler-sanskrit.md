A few thoughts on how we (learners) can simplify speaking Sanskrit
within the limits of Sanskrit Grammar.  
  
• Never use अदस् / अदः  
• Stick to एतद् / एषा for “this” and forget about इयम्/अयम् (vv)  
• Spam participles. -क्तवतु/-तः Do not rely on finite verbs much in
speech.  
• Participles let you skip person. Can use लिखितवान् for
prathma/madhyam/uttama puruSa.  
• We must memorize अस्ति/आसीत् in all forms + all forms of भवति/भविष्यति
by heart.  
• Use -मान in present participles instead of अन्त् . Much easier
declension.  
• Memorize शक् & इष् dhAtu in future and past for sure.  
Take note of all common अकर्मक roots as you can use their past
participles actively. (Ex – सः गतः ).  
  
Take note of the construction PPP + अस् to express perfective aspect. Ex
– गतः अस्ति (गया है) गतः आसीत् (गया था)  
  
Take note of infinitive + इष् for desire. भवितुम् इच्छामि (होना चाहता
हूँ) Also, probably good to memorize -अर्ह् and it’s conjugations. Use
Hindi Numerals + इति to express number. Same for loan words.  
  
3 common postpositions in Sanskrit. Definitely keep a mental note.  
1) सह + instrumental = with  
2) विना + accusative/ablative = without  
3) प्रति + accusative = towards  
  
अस्त्रं विना – without weapon  
नगरं प्रति – towards town  
अस्त्रैः सह – with weapons  
  
Always use भवान्/भवती instead of त्वम्, so you don’t have to remember
2nd person forms of verbs. For all nouns not ending in ‘a’, try forming
a compound that does, so u dont hv to remember a lot of shabdarupas.
Like, राजन्->राजक, मुनि->मुनिवर.
