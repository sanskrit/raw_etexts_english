title = "05 Section D Brāhmī Paleography and the Southern Recension texts"

+++
Impressive proof for the above links between the history of Brahman migration 
and the textual history of the SR of the Mahābhārata is furnished by the history of the 
Brāhmī scripts and their various derivatives, as it has been re-constructed by Iravatam 
Mahadevan (2003). We must keep in mind we cannot have a textual tradition without a 
phonologically appropriate script, linking, in other words, the epic to the relevant human 
agency, the third correlate in the equation. I begin with Mahadevan’s master chart for the 
entire development: 

- 3rd Century BCE Brāhmī 
- 2nd Century BCE Southern Brāhmī, Tamil Brāhmī  
    - 1st Century BCE Bhattripolu 
- 5th Century CE Vaṭṭeḻuttu (from Tamil Brāhmī ) 
- 6th Century CE  Proto-Telugu and Kannada,  Grantha (from Southern Brāhmī) 
  - 7th Century CE Telugu, Kannada
- 7th Century CE Tamileḻuttu (from grantha and Vaṭṭeḻuttu)
- 14th Century Malayalam-Āryeḻuttu (from grantha and Vaṭṭeḻuttu)

We see that the Brāhmī script devolves into two separate and independent lines of 
developments, starting with the Southern Brāhmī and Tamil Brāhmī, arriving in 
peninsular India separately and giving rise to the five major historical scripts of the area, 
Telugu, Kannada, Grantha, on the one hand, and Tamil and Malayalam, on the other. 
The Southern Brāhmī script is seen to give rise to the first three, the Kannada and Telugu 
scripts emerging from an intermediate proto-script of the parent Southern Brāhmī and the 
Grantha, more directly from it. This latter fact has great significance for us. On the other 
hand, the Tamil Brāhmī script is seen first to evolve into Vaṭṭeḻuttu, which from reaction 
with the Southern Brāhmī derivative, Grantha, gives us the Āryeḻuttu script of Malayalam 
and Tamileḻuttu script of Tamil, (the latter, as we will see below but not shown in 
Mahadevan’s chart, showing a further influence of a Northern Brāhmī script—what we 
may call the σ-script after Sukthankar’s use of the Greek letter for the NR text that comes 
south with the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, from about 8th century CE, the period of the 
Aparaśikhā migration.) 

These paleographical facts have significant bearing on the arguments presented 
above on the different genealogies of the Mahābhārata epic and their agents of 
transmission, the Brahman groups, that came to the peninsular India, starting with the 
Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, arriving in the Tamil country well enough in time to take part in 
the production of the poetries of the Sangam period, and the Aparaśikhā Brahmans, 
arriving almost half a millennium afterward, under the Pallava patronage, from 5th 
century CE. 

It is useful to consider the problem in its three main aspects: 

- i. Introduction and an over-view of Mahadevan’s findings 
- ii. the Tamil Brāhmī script and its history 
- iii. the Southern Brāhmī script and its history 
- iv. the Brahmans, the epics and paleography 

## D. i. Introduction and an Over-view of Mahadevan’s Findings 
As Mahadevan (2003: 315) shows, the Tamil Brāhmī script is attested in the 3rd 
century BCE Jain cave inscriptions, starting with those of the Māṅgulam caves, around 
Madurai in the Pāṇṭiyan territory, the Pāṇṭiyan kings being thus the earliest and in the 
early period the most frequent hosts and patrons to the Jain monks and the Jain religion.

It is quite likely that the indigenous Tamil society at this time was largely oral, as Hart 
(1975:157) has argued, still in the phase of the pāṇan songs and their oral traditions and 
the latter in the process of beginning to become the templates for the literate and 
decidedly literary overlays of the Sangam songs, as they have come down to us. The 
Tamil Brāhmī script evolves over the next four centuries, providing the script for the 
Sangam-era compositions, dating from ca. 50 BCE to 200 CE, transforming into an early 
form of the Vaṭṭeḻuttu script by ca. 6th century CE and mature Vaṭṭeḻuttu script afterward. 
Correspondingly, the language itself changes from Old Tamil (250 BCE to 100 CE), 
represented by Tolkāppiyam and probably some Puṛanānūṛu songs, to middle Old Tamil 
(100 to 400 CE), represented by bardic poems on love and war collected in the Eṭṭutokai 
and Pattuppāṭṭu anthologies, into Late Old Tamil, (400-700 CE) with the two epics, 
Cilappatikāram and Manimēkalai, as its representative texts (Lehman 1994; Takahashi 
1995; Steever 2004). The key point to note here is that there is a complete fit between 
Tamil phonology and Tamil Brāhmī script, and the body of Saṅgam, “academy” 
literature, cited so from the 7th century onward to signify the canon of the academy, 
cāṇṛor ceyyuḷ, “poetry of the nobles” (Steever 2004: 1037), runs into some 32,000 lines 
(Lehman 1998: 75). 

The Southern Brāhmī script constitutes, on the other hand, an independent 
derivation from the parent Brāhmī script (Mahadevan 2003: 176), arising at the same 
time as the Tamil Brāhmī script, but it provides an entirely different history. The modern 
languages of Kannada and Telugu are the outcome at one line of development, thus 
through the western areas of the peninsular regions, but it gives rise to the Grantha script 
in the eastern parts, in the Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam region, appearing in epigraphy ca. 6th century 
CE, with what is considered to be the first Grantha inscription (213). 
We do not have much information in Mahadevan about their parallel evolutions 
other than that, at its attestation, the Tamil Brāhmī script is already the entrenched script 
of the Tamil country, fashioned, as Mahadevan argues, in the Jain monasteries around 
Madurai in the Pāṇṭiyan kingdom, ca. 3rd century BCE, already adapted to meeting the 
requirements of the Tamil phonology. As noted, this is the script in which the literate— 
and literary--overlay of the Sangam songs on the Pāṇan oral templates by the pulavan 
(“learned”) poets takes place (Hart 1975). On the other hand, the Southern Brāhmī script 
is attested along an independent line of descent in its Grantha form only ca. 6th century 
CE (Mahadevan: 213), meeting, it should be noted, the needs of the Sanskrit phonology. 
And in Mahadevan’s scheme, the Telugu and Kannada scripts are cohorts in this 
development. 

We notice a gap of almost 600 years between the attestations of the two scripts in 
the Tamil country, the Tamil Brāhmī script by 250 BCE and the Southern Brāhmī script 
by 6th century CE, the first meeting Tamil phonology and the second meeting, the 
Sanskrit phonology. Because of the efflorescence of the Saṅgam poetry in this period of 
600 years—largely in Old Middle Tamil and in Tamil Brāhmī script--we do not raise the 
question if there was literary activity in the peninsular region in Sanskrit in the same time 
period. We have already noted that a substantial number of these poets of Saṅgam poetry 
were Brahmans, wearing the pūrvaśikhā and using the Tamil Brāhmī syllabary to 
compose the songs. Was there no composition among them simultaneously in Sanskrit? 
And if so what script served them? These questions lead in turn to a fundamental 
question: if the Jains brought with them a script (the parent Tamil Brāhmī script) with 
them, did the Brahmans bring with them a script? 

Yet this question is never posed. Consider for instance this statement by Lehman 
(1998:75), “During this period [Sangam], with the propagation of Jainism and Buddhism 
in South India a number of Prakrit and Sanskrit borrowing entered Old Tamil and appear 
in Sangam anthologies (my parenthetical gloss).” The arrival of Brahmanism is not 
similarly posed as an alien influence, presumably because the later Hinduism subsumes 
both Brahmans and non-Brahmans as one group in the Tamil country in contrast to the 
Buddhists and Jains. Yet for this period, Brahmanism in the form of its Śrauta ethos is 
just as alien in the cultural ecology of the Tamil country, and as Sangam poetry shows by 
far the most dominant. For instance, Mahadevan considers the presence of Buddhism in 
the Brāhmī inscriptions to be negligible, something that can be said with equal justice for 
its presence in Sangam anthologies as well. Jainism is the dominant religion in the 
inscriptions, but tapering off in time and almost totally eclipsed in Sangam literature. On 
the other hand, as we will see, the Brahman presence, just as alien in the context as the 
Jain and Buddhist, is on the ascendance. It is almost completely unattested in the Tamil- 
Brāhmī inscriptions, but as an alien presence, it dominates the Sangam anthologies: a 
good percentage of the Sangam poets are Brahmans; śrautism is decidedly extolled, a 
king coming to be named after the ritual hall where the sacrificial animal is immolated, 
the Pāṇṭiyan King, Paliayākacālai Muṭukuṭumip Peruvaḻuti. 
This poses a fundamental question to the recensional history of the epic: if the SR 
text arose as the *Pūrvaśikhā text in my chart in the first millennium of the CE, what 
script could have served the composition? We have placed the epic in the form of a 
*Śārada text and a human agency in the form of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans in the scene; 
we have now to place a script in the region, a script that can meet Sanskrit phonology. It 
is easy to see that the only option we have is the Southern Brāhmī derivative, the Grantha 
script. Thus, I would be arguing that the SR *Pūrvaśikhā text begins its life in a 
*Southern Brāhmī script, Grantha, or an early form of it, being the most logical 
candidate. Mahadevan (213) considers the Grantha script to be derived from Southern 
Brāhmī of the Prākṛt Charters of the Early Pallavas, 4-5th centuries CE. If my scenario 
that the SR rises in the first centuries of the CE, soon after the arrival of the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans in the peninsular India with a *Śārada text of the epic is valid, the only script 
that can meet the demands of the literate composition of the SR is the Grantha script. I 
would be arguing below thus that a form of the Southern Brāhmī script, substantially 
similar or identical with this, arrived in the Tamil country with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans 
and was already present in the area when the Pallava reign begins. The attestation of the 
paviḻiya adherents, ca. 9th century CE, in the Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam area in the Pallava 
epigraphy, suggests that the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans were present in this area as well, 
around Vēṇkata hills, after their dakṣināpatha migration. This is also the area of the 
Prākṛt Charters of the early Pallavas, which display the first epigraphic evidence of the 
Grantha script. 

In sum, then, both the Tamil Brāhmī and the Southern Brāhmī scripts originate 
from a common parental *Brāhmī script (Mauryan?) and both are attested only in 
peninsular India, but at entirely different time intervals, the first by ca. 2rd century BCE 
and the second by only ca. 6th century CE. The Tamil Brāhmī script, eventually 
becoming the Vaṭṭeḻuttu of the Tamil-Kerala country, meets the linguistic needs of the 
Tamil language in the area, most significantly that of the Sangam poetry. On the other 
hand, the Southern Brāhmī scripts must be seen, in some incipient form of the later 
Grantha script, as the vehicle of the Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata, when it 
takes shape, in the first centuries of the Current Era in the same area. 

## D. ii. The Tamil Brāhmī Script 
Based on Mahadevan’s chart given above, we can say that the Tamil Brāhmī 
arrived in South India in 3rd century BCE, and it was brought to peninsular India by the 
Jains, arriving there from the north, it is widely accepted, through Karnataka in the west 
and not through the Vēnkatam hills of the later Brahman migrations: it is likely, as 
Mahadevan (135) notes, that “Tamil Brāhmī script was adapted from the Mauryan 
Brāhmī in the Jain monasteries (‘paḷḷi’) of the Madurai regions sometime before the end 
of the third century BCE” (Mahadevan’s parenthesis). In the Early Period (3rd to 1st 
centuries BCE) in Mahadevan’s chronology, out of 30 sites with 86 Tamil-Brāhmī 
inscriptions, in Early Old Tamil, 28 sites with 84 inscriptions pertain to Jainism, and they 
are mostly in the Pāṇṭiyan region, around Madurai, leaving, as Mahadevan notes (128) 
“no longer any doubt that the Tamil-Brāhmī cave inscriptions are mostly associated with 
the Jaina faith.” In the Middle Period (1st to 3rd centuries CE), the period of the Middle 
Old Tamil, there is a sharp decline in cave inscriptions, and this is accompanied by a 
striking shift of Jainism from the Pāṇṭiyan kingdom to the Karur-based Cēra region, with 
the main trope of the inscriptional passages—the grant of the cave shelter to a Jain monk 
by a ruler—continuing, as for instance in the case of the Pugalūr site on the southern 
banks of the Kaveri river 15 kilometers northwest of Karur, dated to 3rd century CE (405- 
421; Items 61 through 72). By Late Period (3rd to 5th centuries), that of the Late Old 
Tamil, the natural cave inscriptions come to an end, with the Sittanavasal B site (451- 
461; Items 101 through 109), already in early Vaṭṭeḻuttu, being the last of the Jain cave 
shelters—giving way as well to a new kind of Jaina monuments in the form of nicītikai 
(← Kannada inscr. nisidige [Mahadevan: 632]) inscriptions, denoting a “seat of 
penance...where a Jaina monk performs the religious penance of fasting unto death” 
(Mahadevan: 632), the sallēkhana death (“death by starvation”) at Paṛaiyanpaṭṭu and 
Tirunātharkunru (470-473; #s 115 and 116 in Mahadevan’s numeration), ca. 6th century 
CE. 

We are no longer in the oral society of the itinerant pāṇans now but in a fully 
literate period of Tamil history, the lasting legacy of Jainism, as Mahadevan (139) notes, 
to the Tamil history, leading to the efflorescence of the Sangam literature of the early 
centuries, CE.111 As Hart (1975) has conclusively argued, the Sangam poetry is a 
literate—and literary—copy created by a written overlay on the original oral templates of 
the pāṇan songs.112 The Tamil Brāhmī script gives us a script for this overlay, as indeed 
already suggested by Hart (147), the script in which these poems were written, 
presumably with an iron stylus on palm leaves, the stylus held in the tightly closed, 
ritually correct right fist, the technique and practice of the mode of writing, producing in 
time, presumably, the circular shape of the Vaṭṭeḻuttu script. We are at the juncture of the 
rise of the historical Tamil script, Tamil-eḻuttu, adapted, ca. 8th CE, from the Vaṭṭeḻuttu 
script and the Grantha script of the Southern Brāhmī filiation with as noted an input from 
a σ-script that came with the Aparaśikhā Brahmans: I come back to this in C. ii below. 

We must note, however, that the Vaṭṭeḻuttu script remains, at this stage, in its pure and 
unalloyed form in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the Tamil country, as for instance 
in the famous Vēlvikkuṭi Plates of the 8th century, and covering besides most of the 
modern territory of Kerala. 

It is striking that in this new literature of the Sangam poetry, written in a Jain- 
invented script, the Jains and Jainism are signally absent. Other than the solitary 
Akanānūru (123)113 reference to the Jain practice of sallēkhana death, the trope, as we 
saw, of the later, 6th CE, Late Period Tamil Brāhmī-Early Vaṭṭeḻuttu inscriptions— 
marking, it should be added, a Karnataka Jain practice, and not so much Tamil—aspects 
of Jainism itself are remarkably absent in the Sangam poetry.114 We do not have as yet 
an adequate explanation for this sudden decline of Jainism through the six centuries, from 
the Early Period (3rd to 1st centuries BCE) to the Middle Period (1st to 3rd centuries CE) 
and the Late Period, (3rd to 5th centuries CE). Why are the Jains and Jainism 
unrepresented or represented so meagerly in the Sangam poetry, generally accepted to be 
in composition in the first centuries of the Current Era? 

Let us consider. The cave inscriptions testify to a deep and organized Jain 
establishment in the Tamil country from the 3rd century BCE onward. Mahadevan 
adduces (128-139) seven terms of various but precise significations for a Jain monk, from 
kaṇi (head of a gaṇa) through amaṇan (an ascetic), to upacaṇ (a lay teacher of scriptures) 
to māṇākkar, a student or novice. They appear linked to some 14 individual Jain names 
in these inscriptions: one Attiran (<Atri, a gotra term) is an amaṇan; Naṭṭi, Naṭan, Nākan, 
Nanda-Siri-Kuvan are kaṇis. We have seven dhārmic terms, like aṭittānam (< Skt. 
aṭisthāna), ‘seat’ of authority; aṛam, ‘charity or religious life’ and ‘paḷḷi,’ for hermitage, 
the last term also serving as the suffix in the names of many human settlements in the 
Tamil-Kerala country. Mahadevan (139) considers thus the contribution by the Jains to 
the Tamil history “enormous” and “most basic and fundamental”. 
The inscriptional evidence shows that the first stage in the decline of Jainism, or 
its royal patronage, is marked by the cessation of cave sites in the eastern parts of the 
Tamil country, the Pāṇṭiyan kingdom, and their shift to the west, in the Karur-based Cēra 
kingdom (the Pugalūr sites, Item XX: 1 through 12; Mahadevan: 405-421), later to 
produce landmark works by Jain authors, the Cilappatikāram and Cīvakacintāmaṇi, to 
name just two of the most noted texts. We must note as well that the inscriptional 
evidence points to continuous contacts between the Tamil Jains and the Jain centers of 
the Karnataka region, a point emphasized by Mahadevan (135). 

It is useful to note that this is precisely the time period, the dawn of the Current 
Era, in which the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans arrive in the Tamil country in the scheme 
presented above in A.i and to be taken up again in C. iii. below: they are clearly and 
concretely attested in the Sangam poetry with their pūrvaśikhā kuṭumi. Like the Jains, 
they also come from the north, but not through the Karnataka region, but through the 
dakṣiṇāpatha route in the lower Godavari region, possibly at Assaka in its banks, and 
further south through the Vēnkaṭa hills, and eventually into the kingdoms of the 
mūvēndar—the land of the three Indras, the Cēra, Coḷa, and Pāṇṭiya kings, the occurrence 
of the paviḻiya term in the Pallava epigraphy of the 8th century CE still placing them in 
the Toṇṭaimaṇṭalam area as late as 8th century CE. 

We have already noted that the Vedic content of the Sangam poetry is 
considerable, and that a good 10% of the Sangam poets were Brahmans. We must add to 
this the evidence from the Sangam poetry that some of the foremost patrons of the Vedic 80 
ritualism were the Pāṇṭiyan kings, erstwhile hosts to the Jain religion. Perhaps the most 
prominent of these kings is the great Paliyākacālai Muṭukuṭumip Peruvaḷuti, (of 
Puṛanānūṛu 6, 12, 15, 64)—such a patron of Vedic ritual as to be named after the 
yāgaśāla of the Vedic ritual, with the yūpa or the pole fixed just outside the eastern 
boundary of the ritual hall, on the pṛṣṭha axis, the line to the rising sun, to which the 
animal (‘bali’) is tethered to be sacrificed in a Soma class ritual. At Puṛanānūṛu 15. 11- 
17, the poet-singer, Naṭṭimaiyār, almost certainly a Brahman, celebrates this king: 

Given your fury, which of these is in greater in number   
--your once eager enemies shamed and despairing after brandishing   
their long spears that throw shadows and their beautiful shields   
embossed with iron against the power of your swift vanguard   
with its shining weapons, or else the number of spacious sites   
where you have set up columns after performing many sacrifices   
prescribed by the Four Vedas and the books of ritual   
fine sacrifices of an excellence that will not die away[.]   
Hart’s (2000) translation. 

Yet Peru-vaḻuti’s namesake first appears in the Tamil-Brāhmī Māngulam I inscriptions, 
ca. 3rd century BCE, the oldest Tamil-Brāhmī inscription in the Pāṇṭiyan region and the 
oldest Jain inscription all of India, as “Kaṭalan Vaḻuti” (Vaḻuti of the Sea’), the paṇavan 
(“servant”) of Neṭuñceḻiyan, the Pāṇṭiyan king of the Māṅgulam I inscriptions, and who 
oversees the construction of the stone bed for the Jain kaṇi, Nanda-Siri-Kuvan 
(Mahadevan 2003: 315-323; Item I, 1 through 6). “Vaḻuti” is widely attested as a generic 
Pāṇṭiyan name, passing on later to Pāṇṭiyan kings—indeed, one of the two kings credited 
with the collection of two anthologies, Ainkuṛunūṛu and Akanānūṛu, being Ugra-pperu- 
vaḻuti. The Vaḻuti of the Māṅgulam I inscriptions need not thus be a direct ancestor of the 
later Muṭukuṭumip-Peruvaḻuti, the ‘big’ (peru) Vaḻuti, but the fall from favour of the Jains 
in the Pāṇṭiyan kingdom by the end of the Early Period (beginnings of the CE) of the 
Tamil Brāhmī paleography cannot be ignored. The first Vaḻuti is the paṇavan, the 
overseer of the construction of a stone bed for Nanda-Siri-Kuvan, the Jain kaṇi, whereas 
the “Big” Vaḻuti of the Sangam poetry, the patron of four of its songs, is seen to be 
synonymous with Vedic Śrautism, brought to the Tamil-Kerala country by the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans. It is clear that the Brahmans of the Sangam period—that is, a period 
synchronous with the Middle Period of the Tamil- Brāhmī paleography, 1st to 3rd CE-- 
replace the Jains of the Early Period of the Tamil Brāhmī paleography as the new 
recipients of royal patronage at the Pāṇṭiyan courts, with the Śrauta ritual, certainly more 
spectacular than the spectacles of the Jaina religion and more promising of worldly and 
other-worldly glory,115 forging the old Āryan brahma-kṣatra alliance between Brahmans 
and Kings, but now in the Tamil country, as the Rājasūya ritual of the Cōḷa king, Vēṭṭa 
Perunāṛkiḷḷi, shows. Indeed, as Hart notes (1975: 70-71), the Sangam poetry 
acknowledges, as at Puṛ.166, that “a struggle is under way between the orthodox and non- 
orthodox religions” with the Brahman (of the kauṇḍinya gotra) to whom the poem is 
addressed seen as establishing the truth “not agreeing with those who claim the true is 
false, and who realized the lie that seemed as if it were true to utterly defeat those who 
would quarrel with the one ancient book.” The śrauta ‘status kit’116 of the Brahmans 
wins the day, not for the first time, nor the last. 

A corresponding Jain resentment at the Brahman usurpation of their patronage is 
not totally impossible, nor illogical, and only extreme political correctness, no doubt, a 
corrective reaction to the Brahman historiography of the Tamil country of the first five 
decades of the 20th century, would be blind to this.117 The continuous contact of the 
Tamil Jains with their Karnataka counterparts is an important element in this complex 
and changing picture. For, the next great historical event, and perhaps the most important 
in some ways of Tamil history as a whole, although not sufficiently understood, is the 
invasion of Tamil country by the Jain-Kaḷabhras from Karnataka, creating the famous 
Kaḷabhra Interregnum, the “long night” of the Tamil history in the extreme Brahman 
historiography of the subject, with the Pāṇtiyan kingdom receiving the brunt of the 
invasion.118 Thus while the Kaḷabhra’s anti-Brahmanical excesses may have been 
exaggerations of a Brahman historiography, there is wide-spread consensus that the 
Kaḷabhras were both Jain and from Karnataka, and their conquest and rule of the Tamil 
country over three centuries constituted a complete break with the classical Sangam 
period. As Mahadevan (136) notes, “[the Kaḷabhras] displaced the traditional Tamil 
monarchies and held sway over the Tamil country for nearly three centuries until they 
were expelled in the last quarter of 6th century CE by Kaṭunkōṇ, the Pāṇṭiya, from the 
south, and Simhaviṣṇu the Pallava from the north (my parenthesis).” It is an eighth 
descendant of this Kaṭuṇkōṇ, Neṭuñjaṭaiyan, who appears in the Vēḷvikkuṭi Plates (EI 
XVII (1923-24):271), restoring lands of the Vēḷvikkuṭi village to a Brahman petitioner by 
the name of Korkaikiḷan Nar Ciṅkan, originally gifted, as recorded in the plates, to his 
ancestor Korkaikiḷan Narkoṟṟan, by the great Paliyākacālai Muṭukuṭumip Peruvaḷuti of the 
Sangam poetry. 

We have here a grid of three Pāṇṭian kings and three Brahman beneficiaries 
spread over some six centuries. Peruvaḷuti of the Sangam period (ca. 200 CE) gifts the 
village of Vēḷvikkuṭi to a Śrauta Brahman, Narkoṟṟan, the village acquiring its name from 
Tamil vēlvi (“sacrifice”) from Narkoṟṟtan’s śrauta ritual at the site; the Kaḷabhras 
dispossess his descendants of this gift some length of time later, perhaps two centuries. 
King Kaṭuṇkōn, in marking the end of the Kaḷabhra Interregnum, restores the Vēḷvikkuṭi 
land grant to an unnamed Brahman descendant of the original donee, ca. 620 CE, almost 
four centuries after the Peruvaḷuti grant of the Sangam period. All of this is ratified by 
King Neṭuñjaṭaiyan, the issuer of the Vēḷvikkuṭi Plates, seven kings after Kaṭuṇkōn, thus 
ca.760 CE, by affirming the right of Nar Ciṅkan, the petitioner and remote descendant, 
indeed, of the original donee, Narkoṟṟan. And Narkoṟṟan’s patron, King Peruvaḻuti of the 
Sangam period looms as the prime mover of the narrative, himself linked at least by name 
to a Vaḻuti of the Māṅgulam Plates and a patron of the Jains. We are thus witness to a 
period of Jain dominance and patronage, a Brahman usurpation of their patronage in the 
Pāṇtiyan court, a Jain disruption of the established order of the Tamil society through the 
Kaḷabhra Interregnum, and an eventual Brahman restoration. 

I would suggest that part of the disruption of the Kaḷabhra period also results in 
the break-up of the first Brahman group of the Tamil country, the Pūrvaśikhā group, into 
its historical remnants. We first see them in the Tamil country in the Sangam poetry, 
portrayed in it with their kuṭumi in the likeness of a horse’s mane, composing themselves 
a sizeable number of these poems, no doubt using the Tamil Brāhmī script, created by the 
Jain monks in the Pāṇṭiyan kingdom almost two centuries before. After the Kaḷabhra 
Interregnum, we begin to see the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās in Malabar across the Palghat 
gaps facing the Karur-based Cēra kingdom, certainly the śrauta elites of the community, 
and, as Mahadevan notes, creating from 10th to 16th CE the historical Malayalam script 
from the Vaṭṭeḻuttu and Grantha script, called locally the Āryeḻuttu (2003: 212). 
However, Mahadevan does not explain how the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās come to possess 
the Grantha script, by 10th century CE. True, the Grantha script has already been in 
existence, but in the Tamil country proper, for almost half a millennium, and Mahadevan 
does not explain how it comes to the Nambudiris, in Kerala. It is unlikely that the 
Grantha script arrived in a disembodied form to Malabar and to the Nambudiris; it is 
equally unlikely that the conservative Nambudiris would have accepted a script from the 
outside. Besides, composition in Sanskrit went apace among the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās 
in Malabar before the 10th century CE, showing the presence of a Sanskrit-able script in 
the region. We must note too that almost all intercourse between the Tamil country and 
the emerging Kerala entity had ceased by the 10th century CE, Mahadevan’s date for the 
start of the formation of the Āryeḻuttu In my scheme, the script would have 
accompanied the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās at their departure at the Kaḷabhra Interregnum to 
the Malabar area: indeed, it is the script of *Pūrvaśikhā Mahābhārata, the archetypal 
Southern Recension text that was found in the Nambudiri houses and centers of learning 
in the 20th century: I consider this in fuller detail in Section D iii below. 

## D. iii. The Southern Brāhmī Script 
This is the other script into which the Mauryan Brāhmī originally devolves and 
which, like its counterpart, the Tamil Brāhmī script, came to the Tamil-Kerala country, 
giving us three historical South Indian scripts, Kannada and Telugu on the one hand, by 
85 
6th to 7th centuries, and the Grantha script, on the other, a little earlier, by 5th CE. As we 
have already seen, Mahadevan has persuasively suggested that the Tamil Brāhmī script 
was fashioned by the Jain monks ca. 3rd BCE in Madurai Jain monasteries, and this script 
fashions the course of Tamil history for the next half a millennium, functioning as the 
script of the Sangam poetry and transforming later into the Vaṭṭeḻuttu script and serving 
vast areas of the Tamil-Kerala country, all along the east coast of the Tamil country and 
all of today’s Kerala. But what about the origins of its sister script, the Southern Brāhmī 
script, and its development? Who brought it to the south? Why was it not attested till ca. 
5th century CE, with the first Grantha inscription, marking a 600-year gap between the 
Tamil Brāhmī derivatives and Southern Brāhmī derivatives? 

Answers to these and related questions lie in the scenario I have been advancing 
regarding Brahman migration to the south—especially with the Mahābhārata epic. In 
fact, we will see that it is the epic half of the story that completes the validity of the 
argument presented above: the departure of the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, ca.150 BCE from 
the antarvedi area of the Ganga-Yamuna doab with a version of the epic resonant with 
the *Śārada text of the Mahābhārata epic and their arrival in the Tamil country in time to 
be attested in the Sangam poetry both as players in the poems and their composers on the 
one hand, and fashioning on the other hand, the *Pūrvaśikhā version of the Southern 
Recension in the half millennium or so after their arrival, by the Kaḷabhra Interregnum. 
The question that will elucidate the entire problem concerns the script in which 
the *Śārada text came to the south with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans. The Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans have displayed strong oral traditions; the famous example of the Nambudiri 
Pūrvaśikhās is only the most conspicuous one. As Raghavan notes in the 1958 survey of 
the state of all-India Vedic recitation, the Śōḻiya Brahmans also possess live family-based 
Vedic oral traditions.119 Something similar to this could be said about the two other 
temple-based Pūrvaśikhā groups as well, the Chidambaram Dīkṣitars and the Tiruchendur 
Mukkāṇi Brahmans, although outside the Vedic tradition properly so called. 

With this in background, we could raise the question if the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans 
brought the *Sārada text as an oral archive. The *Sarada text, as it has been assembled in 
the Poona CE, runs into 75,000 verses—not a formidable number for a person oriented 
and trained in the arts and sciences of the oral tradition to commit and transmit in a 
memorial tradition: we have the example of a Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhā, Ēṛkkara Rāman 
Nambudiri, dictating the entire text of the Kauṣītaki Brāhamaṇa from memory to E.R. 
Sreekrishna Sarma in 1968, rather to a tape recorder commandeered by Professor Sarma 
for the task of the textualization of the text.120 And this would have been only part of his 
oral repertory; as a Kauṣītaki Ṛgvedi, he would know by memory all of the Ṛgveda from 
the saṃhita mode to the jaṭa vikṛti as well as the Āraṇyaka and Upaniṣadic texts of his 
birth Veda, all part of the svādhyāya regimen of his family. The memory load of 75,000 
verses is not the problem per se, inside the context of a fully functioning and flourishing 
system of oral tradition, as we know the Vedic system to have been. 
The problem lies in the fact, on the other hand, that there would have been no 
need nor use for the memorization of the epics, as no rituals demand intact recitation of 
verses from the epic as is the case with Vedic verses—ignoring for the moment the oral 
origins of the epic, the original oral pragmatics that gave rise to the epic at its formative 
stages. We must note that the various mnemonic devices associated with the Vedic oral 
traditions—the padapātha and its vikṛti modifications—possess no epic counterpart. 

Verses from the epic never really possessed a ritual context, demanding the phonetically 
correct recitations, as we know was the case with the Vedic verses. In other words, there 
is no oral infrastructure for the transmission of the epics, comparable to that of the Vedic 
texts. 

Consider for instance the case of the Pallava epigraphy, where a share of the land 
grant is predicated to the livelihood of a reader of the epic (‘vāśippavanukku’)121: we 
know that the epic was not “read” (√vāci [?], to read; not in DED), much less recited to 
an audience. To judge from the well-founded latter day praxis of the craft, a verse or a 
group of verses would be read or declaimed (rather than ‘recited’ with its Vedic 
connotation of proper accentuation and exact phonology) by the discourser to expatiate 
on issues of right and wrong, right conduct at moments of ethical or moral ambiguity, 
with, as we know, a good deal of sophistry and expostulation. A sample of such 
exposition is in fact a regular weekly column in the Hindu newspaper, appearing in the 
back page of the newspaper.122 We should contrast this with the example of the Homeric 
epics and public recitations of portions of the epics in the Pan-Atheniam festival in 
Athens. Plato’s Ion (530B2) makes it clear that the rhapsodes merely recited, if 
performatively, stretches of verses from the Homeric epics on stage in competition or 
contest with other rhapsodes123: no commentarial discourses followed the recitation. In 
the Indian example, we know that the praxis is completely different, the discourser 
reading from a written (printed, today) copy of the epic verse or passage from the epic as 
a take off strategy, as a point of departure, to pass on to his many homilies and casuistries 
on matters related and unrelated to the epic verses. In turn, we must contrast this with the 
tape recorder-like fidelity of recitations of the Vedic verses in Vedic rituals among the 
same people, in the same tradition. In other words, we may rule out oral tradition as a 
means in the transmission of the epic, both in time and space. 

In addition, the parva-based transmission of the Mahābhārata text would have 
made the mastery of the entire epic to a memorial tradition impossible—the parva 
transmission itself being a consequence of the literate tradition, it should be added. One 
of the discoveries made by the Poona editors during the preparation of the Critical 
Edition was that the transmission of the epic was often along individual parvans, rather 
than the entire text of the epic, an inevitable condition with a text of the size of the 
Mahābhārata. It makes no sense to think that just one or two parvans would be mastered 
in oral tradition and transmitted as such. We could add parenthetically that if all parvans 
of the epic are found in a given resource center, then the text tradition of the center in 
question must be generally unimpeachable. This is what we find in the case of both the 
Pūrvaśikhā and Aparaśikhā Brahmans: each of these groups could have assembled a 
complete 24-parvan Southern Recension Mahābhārata text, as indeed they did. We have 
a complete verse-to-verse translation of the Pūrvaśikhā-Malayalam version of the 
Mahābhārata into Malayalam by the prince Kuññikkuṭṭi Tamburān in 1904-07; we have 
P.P.S. Sastri’s Kumbakonam edition of the Aparaśikhā Southern Recension in 1933, 
assembled from the Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu version of the Mahābhārata, from the 
Sarasvatī Mahāl Library: P.P.S.Sastri was the director of the library.124 
For all these reasons, we can discount the possibility of an oral archivization and 
transmission of the Mahābhārata epic—both vertically in time from generation to 
generation and horizontally, across geographical space, from northern India to other 
parts. Indirectly, this supports the Hiltebeitel (2001: 20-21) thesis of a committee-based 
redaction of the entire corpus,125 a script driving, perhaps, the redactorial process. It is 
easy to see that the only script that offers itself is the Southern Brāhmī in Mahadevan’s 
chart, providing the conveyance of the *Śārada text to South India with the Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans, the latter group, with strong adherence to the Jaiminīya tradition and thus 
frame narratives, originally perhaps even part of the Hiltebeitel committee. Let us note 
that the sister script, Tamil Brāhmī, has already traveled southward independently with 
the Jain monks, who fashion this script by 3rd BCE to meet the demands of Tamil 
phonology, a point that cannot be overemphasized. That is, in effect, this script, the 
script of the Sangam poetry, cannot carry the full range of the sounds of the Sanskrit 
language and literature, ruling itself out for the transcription of the *Pūrvaśikhā SR 
Mahābhārata, although attested in the Tamil country by 3rd century BCE. The only 
script that possesses at the same time attestation in peninsular India, albeit late in Grantha 
script, by 5th century CE, and the ability to carry the full range of Sanskrit phonetics, is 
the *Southern Brāhmī script. 

Once we accept this, many known and stray facts fall in place. The Pūrvaśikhā 
Brahmans depart the antarvedi area of the Gangā-Yamunā doab, with the *Śārada text in 
the Southern Brāhmī script, ca. 150 BCE. At and after their arrival in the Tamil country, 
they participate in the creation of the Sangam literature in the Tamil-Brāhmī script, 
already in use in the area, having been created earlier by the Jain monks. They also 
create the *Pūrvaśikhā text of the Mahābhārata in the Southern Brāhmī script, over the 
next several centuries. In other words, we must assume a sort of di-graphia,126 equivalent 
to diglossia, but in the realm of scripts, among the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, using the Tamil 
Brāhmī script for writing in Tamil and the Southern Brāhmī script to write in Sanskrit. 90 
The rise of the Southern Recension text is proof positive for this: the text exists as a 
physical object, each of the 18 parvans of the Northern Recension worked over; material 
adapted from khilā (“appendix”) sections to re-fashion the main parts of the epic, as in 
the peroration of Bhīṣma on behalf of Kṛṣṇa in the Sabhāparvan; with several episodes 
transposed, the whole epic becoming more Brahmanical than the already Brahmanical 
Northern Recension and attaining a 24-parvan extent in its final form. It is not enough if 
we imagine the process in the abstract: we must account for the human agencies behind 
the process and the possible scripts that could meet the demands of a Sanskrit phonology. 
It is thus that the Southern Brāhmī script evolves into the Grantha script, over the half- 
millennium or so. The royal epigraphy of the three Tamil kingdoms in the area continues 
in the meanwhile to be in the Tamil-Brāhmī script, a practice already established by the 
Jain monks, with the “unique” adoption of a northern Brāhmī script for the non-Sanskrit, 
Dravidian phonology of Tamil, attested in a total of 70 inscriptions in the Pāṇtiyan 
kingdom, 17 in the Cēra kingdom, 5 in the Toṇṭai region, and 4 in the Cōḷa area, from 3rd 
BCE to 6th CE (Mahadevan 2003: 134). In the meanwhile, the Southern Brāhmī script, 
the script of the Mahābhārata epic, remains with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, becoming the 
Grantha script in time and giving us the *Pūrvaśikhā text by the Kaḷabhra Interregnum. 
The date of the first appearance of the Grantha script in inscription supports this, the early 
6th century CE, a century or so before the Old Kannada and Telugu scripts. Let us keep 
in mind the pakaḷiya attestations, and thus a Pūrvaśikhā presence, in the Tonṭaimanṭalam 
region during the Pallava period. 

In other words, the Southern Brāhmī-Grantha script, say *Grantha script, is a 
paleographic counterpart of our *Pūrvaśikhā SR text. At the Kaḷabhra Interregnum, the 
future Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās take both the *Pūrvaśikhā text of the Southern Recension 
and the *Grantha script to the Malabar area over the Palghat gaps, creating the Āryeḻuttu 
from the Grantha and the resident Vaṭṭeḻuttu scripts from 10th to 16th centuries. Indeed, 
the area of the Āryeḻuttu script shows itself clearly as an intrusive wake in the linguistic 
map of Kerala, formed by the arrival of the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās through the Palghat 
gaps, with Vaṭṭeḻuttu in use in areas both to the north, as Kōleḻuttu, a form of Vaṭṭeḻuttu, 
and Vaṭṭeḻuttu proper in the south, in the historical Travancore-Cochin region (Map IV). 
Both the *Pūrvaśikhā text, now distinctly as the Σ-text, and its Grantha script stay behind 
in the Tamil country, with the Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās. They create from the Grantha script of 
the epic and the Vaṭṭeḻuttu script of the Tamil Brāhmī family the extant historical Tamil 
script, the script of the Āḻvār (and Nāyanār) poetry. 

We are now in the Pallava period of Tamil history and the arrival of the 
Aparaśikhā Brahmans, from 4th CE onward. There can be little doubt that the Aparaśikhā 
Brahmans were a literate group, allowing writing, unlike the Pūrvaśikhās, to enter even 
their Śrauta praxises. And the early Pallava epigraphy shows the script to have been the 
“Brāhmī Script of the Southern Class” (Mahalingam: 29-30).127 By the mature Pallava 
period, the Sanskrit parts of the Copper Plate paleography are in the Grantha script and 
Tamil parts, in historical Tamil script, the common script of the region, created from the 
Grantha and Vaṭṭeḻuttu scripts. As with the precedents of the Śrīvaiṣṇavism and the 
Southern Recension Mahābhārata, the Aparaśikhā Brahmans adapt themselves to the 
host traditions, in the matter of the writing systems as well. 
Is there a trace of the Aparaśikhā script that came with them, a counterpart to the 
σ-text in the final paleographical picture of the Tamil country? Sure enough: as William 
Bright notes (1998: 45) “[I]n the eighth century (CE) a competing script came into use 
for Tamil—probably reflecting a northern variety of Brāhmī, but with strong influence 
from the Grantha.” It needs to be scarcely added that the eighth century marks the arrival 
of the Aparaśikhā Brahmans in large numbers, with the rise of grāmadeya of 108 
families, and we have our σ-script. 

## D. iv. The Brahmans, the Sanskrit Epics and Paleography 
The famed Laurentianus codex of the plays of Sophocles,128 in the early 
“miniscule” style of writing, six plays and a fragment out of, it is thought, a total of 120 
plays the playwright wrote through his long life in Athens, from 495-406 BCE, is dated 
to the 11th century CE. It was made in a Byzantium scriptorium from an eighth century 
CE archetype, with five extra lines on each page and enough marginal space for the 
scholia, already, it would seem, a set practice in the tradition of manuscript transmission 
of Western classical texts. It was acquired in Byzantium by Giovanni Aurispa, a Sicilian 
manuscript collector and dealer, between 1422 and 1423, and sent in advance of his own 
journey with an additional 238 volumes back to Florence, to Niccolo dé Niccoli, a 
prominent member of the group which surrounded Cossimo dé Medici in Florence. It lay 
in the Medici collections till 1523, traveling then to Rome with the Medici Pope, Clement 
VII, when he built the extant Florence Laurentian library to receive them. Another 
edition of the Sophocles plays appeared in the meanwhile, in 1502, in Venice, also from 
other Byzantium manuscripts, dating from 14th century CE, published by Aldo Munuzio, 
but in ignorance of and thus without consultation with the Laurentian manuscript. The 
Aldine text held sway till the second Juntine edition of 1547, the first Juntine edition 
having been published in 1522 largely based on the Aldine edition of 1502. The second 
Juntine edition of 1547 incorporates the codex Laurentianus of the Sophocles plays for 
the first time into the textual tradition the plays, thereby and thereafter making codex 
Laurentaianus the basis for the editio princeps of the Sophocles textual history. 
I provide this excursus into the textual history of the plays of Sophocles, not, as it 
might seem at first sight, to draw contrast between the histories of transmission of texts 
between east and west, the precision of the latter and the looseness or waywardness of the 
former but rather to show that an equally sagacious narrative of the transmission of texts 
is possible for the family of the Mahāhārata texts and manuscripts, if the right questions 
are posed and rational answers arrived at. Far too often, a regional text is taken for 
granted, given a disembodied existence, as if the epic unearthed itself there like the 
Copper Plate inscriptions, outside the realm of the questions that have governed this 
investigation. Both Brahman groups can be concretely linked to the textual history of the 
Southern Recension of the Mahābhārata epic. Moreover, we see that an adequate 
narrative of its formation can be obtained from the history of the paleography of the two 
major families of scripts of the region, the Sanskrit-able Southern Brāhmī script and the 
Tamil-able Tamil Brāhmī script—in other words, a literate version of texts, pointing to 
the fallacy of the idea of nebulousness, or worse, the absence of “texts”, in the east. The 
Ṛgveda all by itself is a constant and eternal repudiation of this fallacy, remaining an oral 
text for all practical purposes to this day among the Brahmans of this investigation. 
However, even Sukthankar echoes such a sentiment in his persistent invocation of the 
difficulty of the creation of a CE of the Mahābhārata with his reiteration, surely once too 
often, of the sui generis nature of the epic. There is no doubt the epic is sui generis, but it is so in the manner of most archaic texts. 

This is the larger context in which I have framed the above argument that brings 
together three items in an algorithmic relationship, the Brahmans, the Sanskrit epics and 
their various scripts, the three irreducible correlates. It is quite true that we cannot 
conjure the Byzantine scriptoriums in the various points of interest in the textual history 
of the Mahābhārata—a point, ca.150 BCE, in the erstwhile realm of the Kuru-Pāñcāla 
chieftains and kings--Witzel’s Brahman kings promoting the Śrauta traditions--of the 
gathering of Hiltebeitel’s Brahman committee and the resulting *Śārada codex; a Sangam 
locale later, ca.100-400 CE, where the *Pūrvaśikhā Mahābhāratha was created; or a 
Nāyaka facility where the Aparaśikhā text took shape. What I have tried to show above 
is that only because some analogues of these facilities existed at these and other such 
relevant geographical points do we have the extant manuscripts of the different text- 
traditions of the Mahābhārata. 

First of all, the analogues to the vellum parchments of the Byzantine scriptoriums. 
I have claimed above that the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans left the antarvedi area of the Ganga- 
Yamuna area with the Mahābhārata epic, a version close to the Śārada text. What was 
the epic written on? I believe that we can rule out leather as the physical manuscript: 
*Śārada text was close to 75,000 verses and it is difficult to imagine enough leather for 
this much text. The būrjapatra is a choice for the material, and it appears as an item of 
trade in the Rāmāyaṇa.129 However, its supply, available only in birch forests 7500 feet 
high in the Kashmiri-Himalayan mountains may well be as rare as the Soma of the 
Mujāvat mountains. More likely, the physical manuscript would be the palm leaf linked 
to an ink-quill technology. Once it reaches peninsular India, the palm leaves can readily 
be imagined to take its place, and considering the sheer size of the text, it is even possible 
that the first transcription of the *Śārada codex in būrjapatra or palm leaf into the 
traditional peninsular palm leaves based on an iron stylus technology may well be the 
beginning of the process of the revision of the *Sārada text into what becomes the first 
ornate *Pūrvaśikhā text of the Southern Recension. We must keep in mind that by now, 
as Mahadevan notes,130 the Tamil society has become truly literate and the use of palm 
leaves for writing, pervasive—leading, indeed, as I note above, to the circular shape of 
the Tamil-Brāhmī script as it becomes Vaṭṭeḻuttu. Professional scribes, the equivalent of 
the personnel of the Byzantine scriptoriums, must have been widely available, extant in 
the 1950’s in my memory in Kerala as recorders--directly on palm leaves with iron stylus 
held in a closed right fist--of the horoscopes of new born babies, when pen and paper had 
become de rigueur in our other lives.131 

Second, the script. If we accept that the Mahābhārata tradition is literate, then we 
have to deal with issues relating to a script in which the corpus was copied—in either 
būrjapatra in the north and palm leaf in peninsular India. An alternative, of course, is to 
imagine that the epic was in an oral tradition all the way to the dawn of the CE, as 
Fitzgerald intimated to me,132 close to 100,000 verses—without, however, a plausible 
infrastructure to support or maintain it in oral tradition. As already noted above, an 
institutionalized oral tradition was never part of the transmission of the epic, except 
perhaps at its origins. Things clarify themselves exemplarily once we cross this Rubicon. 
We see that, for the development of the Southern Recension in the physical medium of 
the palm leaf, the only relevant script is the Southern Brāhmī script. Its sister script, the 
Tamil Brāhmī script is already attested in the Tamil country by 3rd century BCE, its 
archetype having left northern India with the Jain monks some considerable time 
before—a century or so, as Mahadevan suggests (159)--for the Jain monks to develop 
from a Sanskrit-based writing system a script appropriate for Tamil phonology. 
However, the epic did not come to the Tamil country with the Jains, but with a group of 
Brahmans, almost two centuries later, by the dawn of the Common Era and the Sangam 
poetry, into an area already widely literate with the Tamil Brāhmī script. This is the 
logic—a Sanskrit text being made from one version to another—that forces us to accept 
the reality of the Southern Brāhmī as the script of the epic, and that it came with the 
Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans, the latter being the di-graphic human agency behind both the 
Sangam poems, in their Brahmanical contents and authorships, and the Southern 
Recension text of the Mahābhārata epic. We do not have an alternative explanation in 
the present state of our knowledge. 

Third, the Brahmans: the analogues of Niccolo dé Niccoli and Cossimo dé Medici 
of the Sophocles text history. Both groups of Brahmans, Pūrvaśikhā as well as 
Aparaśikhā, were full equivalents to the Renaissance figures, in the matter of the 
transmission of the texts and literate scholarship. More than this, the really important 
point to note is that the infrastructure that served the transmission of the texts in South 
Asia was analogous, and of a high order. Both groups of Brahmans above brought the 
śrauta traditions of Vedism to the peninsular India, the first group, the Pūrvaśikhās by the 
beginnings of the Common Era and maintaining them still in a live oral tradition, and the 
second, Aparaśikhā Brahmans by the Pallava-Cōḷa periods, an entirely different tradition 
derived from a later corpus of Vedic texts and in a partly literate state. Indeed, this 
demands an infrastructure of far greater complexity than that needed to run the Byzantine 
scriptoriums. First and foremost, it needs a specific tri-Vedic axis of praxis: the hautram 
of a specific school of Ṛgvedic texts, the ādhvaryam likewise of a specific Yajurveda 
tradition and, third, easily the most important of the three, the audgātram of a specific 
Sāmaveda tradition—all institutionalized in the family-based svādhyāya system. 
Migrations of Brahman groups who have sustained a Śrauta tradition could only have 
been well-organized and systematized with the sort of sophisticated infrastructure such as 
the one we are led to imagine for Byzantium or Florence. 

A large part of the infrastructure would be linked naturally to the demands and 
praxis of the Vedic tradition, the mastery of the three ritual Vedas in the first place and 
their immense and baroque viniyoga deployments in the rituals—demanding 16 priests 
for the śrauta ritual. We know that the śrauta ritual demands a rehearsal of some six 
months,133 as observed in its modern day performances. Even if we allow a shorter 
period for preparation and rehearsals from constant and regular practice, it would be 
nearly the occupation of an entire year. In other words, the two Brahman groups in 
question here, Pūrvaśikhā or Aparaśikhā, must be imagined as engaged in śrauta matters 
most of the year, performing the śrauta ritual every year at vernal equinox on their 
centuries-old migrations southward.134 The Assaka Soma ritual of the Suttanipada, 
possibly, is one such example. That they did so is proved by the survival of the śrauta 
Vedism in both groups, each distinct and autonomous. For instance, we know that the 
śrauta tradition with the Vādhūla school of the Yajurveda meeting the praxis of 
ādhvaryam has been extinct among the Nambudiri Pūrvaśikhās since the beginnings of 
20th century CE 135: it also means that it had survived among them till then, from 5th 
century BCE, at the latest. To consider another example, a śrauta tradition is altogether 
no longer extant among the Tamil-speaking Śōḻiya Pūrvaśikhās,136 but we know from the 
Karandai Plates that it existed among them till 1029-30 CE, presumably in a live and 
continuous tradition from its origins. 

To throw in the Mahābhārata epic into this infrastructure of transmission of 
systematized knowledge is to ask a small camel--okay, a large one--into the tent, albeit in 
a literate transcript in a generally oral tent. Once we accept the formation of the 
Mahābhārata in its present form and extent, and its canonical status as the fifth Veda, we 
cannot separate it from the Brahman groups of the type we encounter above. We must 
recall here that the founding myth of the Mahābhārata is a śrauta ritual, the Janamejaya 
Sarpa Sattra. This represents a Brahman possession of the epic, perhaps not wholly 
disconnected from the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans of the above account in that Vyāsa, the 
master composer of the epic and a Parāśara Brahman, appears as part of the sadasya of 
the Śrauta ritual, an office unique to the Kauṣītaki hautram of the Pūrvaśikhā Śrauta axis 
and second, the hyper-developed frame narratives among the Jaiminīya groups, also part 
of the Pūrvaśikhā matrix: whether it was also at the same time a Bhṛgu usurpation of the 
epic is, I believe, not a wholly closed question.137 Brahman groups with the sort of 
learning infrastructure, or learning quotient, as above, would also keep the text in 
transmission, but as a literate transcript in an otherwise still predominantly oral culture. 
A literate artifact means a script, and we see that appropriate and relevant paleography is 
attested in both Brahman groups. 

Lastly, we should resist the ease of imagination a disembodied regional version 
found in situ in isolated points of South Asia affords us, as in an abstract statement like 
“The Mahābhārata epic is found in its shortest Southern Recension in Kerala.” To 
subject such a statement to an Occam razor analysis, an analysis of its irreducible 
physical, areal correlates—the script, the physical form of the manuscript, the extent of 
the epic itself, the human agencies behind the texts—in terms, further, of their final 
filiations, is to arrive at the conclusions reached above: that the Mahābhārata, 
substantially the Śarada codex text of the CE, or the *Sarada text in my scheme, left the 
antarvedi area of northern South Asia ca.150 BCE with the Pūrvaśikhā Brahmans in a 
*Southern Brāhmī script in possibly the būrjapatra manuscript or the palm leaf 
manuscript of northern India, both using an ink-quill technology of writing;138 they 
created the *Pūrvaśikhā text in the Tamil-Kerala country from this in the half millennium 
after arrival, the recensional change from the *Sarada to *Pūrvaśikha probably taking 
place in the process of transcription from the northern manuscripts to the palm leaf 
manuscript of the South with the stylus technology, the original *Southern Brāhmī script 
becoming gradually the Grantha script in the process; a *Pūrvaśikhā text moves to the 
present territory of Malabar in Kerala at the Kaḷabhra Interregnum and comes to Poona 
for collation purposes toward the creation of the Poona CE; a *Pūrvaśikhā text remains in 
the Tamil country as the Σ-text to host Sukthankar’s σ-text, that is, playing host to the 
Aparaśikhā immigrants and to their Northern Recension text, creating eventually the 
Tamil (Grantha)-Telugu version of the Southern Recension.
