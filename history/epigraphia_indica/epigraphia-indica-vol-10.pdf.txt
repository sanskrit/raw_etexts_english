No. 1,-THE PALLAYA INSCRIPTIONS OF THE SEVEN PAGODAS 
BY PKOFESSOR E, HULTZSCH, PnJX; HALLE (SatB). 
"The Seven Pagodas"is the Anglo-Indian name of an extensive groupof ancient root sculptures on the sea-shore, about 30 miles south of Madras. These interesting remains can he reached from Madras byhoat on the Buckingham Canal, or from ChingleputJunction by bullock-cart via Tirukkalukkunjpm. The present Tamil designationof the placeis Mavali varam, while the Brahmagas call it bythe more learned Sanskrit name Mahabalipuram, .e, 'the city of Mahabali.' In the Chola insoriptionsof the"Shore temple"we find the terms Mamallapuram, *,e.' the cityof Mah&raalla/ and Tirukkadalmallai,1 i.e.' the holy Mallai on the sea.' Mamallapuramthen formed partof Amui-nadu, a sub-division of Amur-kottam.a Both thie district and its sub-division were named after the present villageof Amur3 near Mamallapuram. The four last of the subjoined inscriptions (Nos. 23-26)are at Jfeluvangup paxn, a village 2 miles north of Mavalivaram. 
The wonderful monuments at the Seven Pagodas have attracted the attention of many ourists and antiquarians. A collection of notices of them was publishedat Madras in 1869 by Captain Oarr under the title"Descriptive and Historical Papers Relatingto the Seven Pagodas on the Coromandel Coast." By far the best and most authentic account was furnished in 1880 by Dr. JFergussonin his Owe Temples oj India, pp. 105-159. The Madras Journal of Literature and Science for the year 1880 (pp. 82*232)contains an excellent guide, with a map, by Colonel Branfill, which will be much appreciated byvisitors to the spot and will save them much time and trouble. 
The important questionof the authors and the dates of those excavations cau be answered only by a careful study of the inscriptions engraved on them. These I published alreadyin 1890 in the first volume of South-Indian Inscriptions, pp.1-8. I now reprint my former readings and translations, with some improvements and a few additions,4 to accompanysix plates which are based on excellent infced estampages, prepared recently under the personal

supervision of Rai Bahadur Yenkayya. For the introductory remarks and the notes I have utilised some fresh materials which have accumulated since the time of the original publication. The language of &e inscriptionsis Sanskrit, Noa. 1-19, 25 and 26 are in prose, Sos. 20-24 in verse.1 The authors of the inscriptions themselves inform us that they were members of the ancient southern dynastyof the Pallavas. As none of the inscriptions contains any date3 we must try to fix their approximatetime on palroographicai grounds, As the accom panying- plates mil show, the sculptors employedfour different alphabets, three of which are of the southern type, while the fourth is in northern characters,   
I. The majority of the short epigraphs on the monolith now styledC( Dharmaraja~ ratha" (Nos. 1-16) resemble the Jtaheudravadi and Siyamaiigalanicave inscriptions which I have assigned to the Pallava king Mahendravarman I.3 Among the names and surnames of the king -who excavated the"Dharmaraja-ratha"we find twice Narasimha (Nos.1 and 7), which, seems to have he&n his actual name, while the remaining designations look like mere surnames, Among the successors of Mahendravarman I. there were two kings named Narasimhavarmaiu As the typeof the alphabet is more archaic than that of the second set of inscriptions (which, as will appear presently, probably belongsto the time of ParameSvaravar jnun L, the father of Naraaimhavarman II.), the Narasimha of the"Dharmaraja-ratha" inscriptions may be identified with NarasiriihavaHnaJi I., the son of MahSndravannan I, and the contemporary and enemy of the Western Chalukya king Bolakesin It. (A.D. 609-642). This identification is rendered almost certain by & reference to the published facsimile of the Badami inscription of Narasiriihavannan I.;* the alphabet o this record is nearlyidentical with that of the"Dharmar^ja-rathaninscriptions, Consequently,the"Dharmaraja-ratha" must have been sculpturedin the first half of the seventh century of our era. 
XL The second, veryflorid alphabetis found in the inscriptions of the Eallava king AtyantafcSma on the monolith now styled"GtengSa temple"(No. 20), in the two caves called"DharmarS^a-ina^dapa1 ' (No. 21) and**BSmanuja-maiidapa" (No. 22), and in a short inscription of the same king on the"Dharmar&ja-ratha" (No. 17). The same alphabetis em ployed in the Kafrchi inscriptiona of Bajasiihha and his son MahSndravarman (III.).4 The Kan chi inscriptions seem to call Bajaabhha also Narasimhavishnu, aud theystate that be was the son of TJgradanda,* the destroyer of Banarasika's city.' Dr. Fleet was the first to point out that in one of the Kanohi inscriptions Ugradaijdais named Faramgs vara, and that the epithet Banarasika refers "to the Western Ohalukya Hug VikramSditya I. (A.D, 655 to 680), He thus established the identityof Paranoelvara ftZtS* Ugr^c&nda with the Pallava king 
Parame6varavarman L, who, as we know from ihe Kuram pj'ates, crossed arms with Vikramaditya I. Dr, I"leet further concluded that Rajasimha ftZias Narasinihaviahntt was the Pallava king Narasimhavarman. EL of the copper-plate grants.8 This then was the kingin whose time the Kailasanatha temple atKanchi was built. The alphabetof Atyantakama's inscriptions at the Seven Pagodas agrees so closely with that of the Kailasanatha epigraphsthat both must be assigned to about the same period, '.Now from- jzerse 2 of No, 20 I venture to conclude that Atyantakama's actual name wafe ParamBYara. Consequently,I proposeto identify this Atyantakama with either Paramvaravarman L, the father of Rajasimha, or Parame^varuvarmau II., the son of Eajasimha, preferably with PftrameSvaravarman I.,

whose reign, is well established by inscriptions on stone and copper, while, instead of Parames varavannaTi II., the Kanchi inscriptions mention another son of Rajasimha, named Mahendra varman(IIL). The second groupof inscribed monuments at the Seven Pagodas would thus belong to about the third quarter of the seventh oentury, 
in. The third alphabetis that of an inscriptionof the Pallava king Atiranachanda on the left of the cave at Sftjuvanguppam (No. 23) and of three short epigraphs: one at the top ot the same cave (No. 25), another on the"Dharmaraja-ratha"(No. IS), and a third near the"GrSpis' Churn"(No. 19). It resembles, thoughit is not quiteidentical with, the alphabet of the KMakudi plates of Nandivarman,1 The name (or surname) Atinvnachanda is unknown from other sources. As the alphabetof stone inscriptions sometimes differs slightly from that of contemporaneous records on copper,there would be ao objectionto assigning these records, as will be done in the aoquel, to the timo of Nandivarman, the contemporaryof the Western Chalukya king Vikramaditva IL 
IV. -The last alpha'bet, an early kind of Nftgari,is employedin the inscription on the right of the Ss^uvangnppam cave (No. 24) and in a short label at the top of the same cave (No. 26). No. 24 is a copyof the first six verses of Atiran.achanda'8 epigraphon the left of the same cave (No. 23), and No. 26 is a repetition of the label in the third alphabet which is engraved immediately above it (No. 25). The characters resemble those of the JNagari version on the Pattadakal pillar of the Western Ghalukya kingKirtivarman, II.9 Aa we know that the predecessor of this king, VtoamSditya II.,8 took Kanchi from the Pallava king Nandivarman, it is perhapsnot too bold to surmise that the inscriptions in the third and fourth alphabets belong to the reignof his enemy Nandivarman, who would then have borne the surname Atiranachanda. The sadden collapse of the Pallava powerat the hands of Vikramaditya II. may have been the reason why so many of the excavations at the Seven pagodas have remained unfinished. As I have remarked in South-Indian Inscriptions Vol. L p. 10, we meet with the same pluralityof alphabetsin the Kailasanatha temple at Kanchi. The enclosure of this temple bears three tiers of identical inscriptions. The characters of the third tier are those of the epigraphsof Narasimhavarman II. The alphabetsof the second and first tiers we, respectively, those of the left and wght inscription* of the Sajuvan guppam cave. Consequently they must have been added at a later date by Atiranaohanda (Nandivarman ?). 
I am fully aware that my remarks on the third and fourth alphabets do not rest on quite firm ground. But, in the absence of further information, we may plage, the inscriptions written in both alphabets in the time immediately precedingthe conquestof the Pallava territory by Vikramaditya II. (A.D. 733-734 to 746-747). The fact that a northern, alphabet was 
employed along with, a southern one suggeststhat the artisans were recruited from the north of India. 
The two last columns of the accompanying table will show at a glanceto whish of the Pallava kings of the third column I proposeto assign each of the Pallava records of the Seven Pagodas. It is worth noting that, with his usual sagacity, Dr, Pergusaon had already succeeded in fixing the approximate periodof the remains at the Seven Pagodas at about 650 to 700.* 
The contents of the subjoined inscription* are singularly uninteresting and devoid of histo rical facts. All that we learn from them is a string of names and surnames of three different

Pallava kings, and the fact that the excavations on which theyare engraved were shrines of Isvara (Siva) and bore each the name of its respective founder. Thus the "Gansa temple" (No. 20) and the"Dharmaraja-mandapa"(No. 21) were called AtyantaMma-Pallavesvara griha, i.e. 'the Bvara templeof Atyantakama-Pallava.' On the"Dharmaraja-ratha," which had probahly "been founded by NarasimhajVarrnan I.] alias Atyantakama, the same name seems to have been bestowed by his descendant [Paramesvaravarman I,] alias Atyantakama or Banajaya (No, 17). The Saluvanguppam cave bears the label AtwanaGhan$a,-3?alla[vesvara griTia] (Nos. 25 and 26), i.e.' the Isvara templeof Atiranachanda-Fallava.'   
The last column but one of the table on page 4 shows that each of the three Pallava tings Narasimha, Paramesvara and Atiranachanda bore the two surnames Srinidhi and Sribliam. In this connection I would like to mention certain Pallava coins from Havalivaram which I saw in the cabinet of the Eev. E. Loventhal of Vellore. All of them bear on the obverse a bull 
(the crest of the Pallavas), and various legends above it. One of th$ Going, with a star on the reverse,1 reads firibharah; another, with a fish on the reverse,8$nm'[<Z/ii] ;and a third, with a cross on the reverse,3Manapara. With the legendof the last coin compare the Uruda Atimana in the inscription No. 9 of the"Dharmaraja-ratha." 
A.INSCKIPTIONS OW THE "DEAEMARAJA-EATEA" AT MAVAUVABAM.* 
Nos. 1-16 of these inscriptionsconsist of a number of words in the nominative case, which their first decipherers, Drs. Babington and Burnell, took for names of deities. From a compari son with the remaining inscriptions of the Seven Pagodas, where several of them recur,it follows, however, that they are lirudas of a Pallava king whose actual name seema to have been Narasimha (Nos. 1 and 7). Among these surnames, Atyantakama, Srinidhi and Sribhara were borne also by the two Hngs*mentioned in the later inscriptionsof the Seven Pagodas. Others appear again in the inscriptions of the Pallava king Eajasimha at KaficM, viz, Parapara Bhuvanabhajana,5 Srimeglia and Sarvatobhadra, 
The two last inscriptions on the"Dharmaraja-ratha"are not written in the same alpha bet as Nos. 1-16, No. 17 follows the typeof Nos. 20-22, and No, 18 that of No. 23. Bach of them designates the"Dharmaraja-ratha"as' the ls*yara (Siva) templeof Atyantakama

1 By the expresaion atyantaleamayathe panegyristalso alludes to the king's surname Atyautakatoa. * All these epithets have to he appliedin the first instance to Siva,, and with slight changesof meaning to the king himself. Chitramaya occurs as the name of a Pallava kingin the TJdayendiram platesof Nandivarman (South lad. Insor. Vol. II. p. 372) ; comparealso the liruda Mayaeharain the KaiichI inscription*, and Ameyam&ya in No. 8. With Gunabhajana compare Gunakya in the Zaficha ingcriptions, and Gunabhara, a surname of Mahendrar varman L (see above, Vol. VI. p. 320). For Svaptha see verse 7, and for Niruttara No. 14. ParameSyara is the only word in the whole inscription which looks like the actual name of the king. This view is suggested by toe fact that two Pallava kings named Paramgs>aravarman are known from copper-plate grants ; see Soutfrlnd. Inter. Vol. IL p. 844.

Niravadya-Punyavallabha,1 the^writer of the present grant, was the successor of Sri Bama-Punyavallabha, who wrote in Saka-Samvat 616 the Earihar platesof Vinayaditya; and Niravadya Sriinad-Aniv&rita Punyavallabha was the writer of the Kanchi inscription of Vikramaditya II, Dhanamjaya-Punyavallabha., the writer of the Kendur grant in Saka-Samvat 672, speaks of himself as Srlmad-Anivarita Dhanamjaya-Punyavallabha in the Vakkaleri plates of Saka-Samvat 679. 
It seeme to me that we have four generations of writers mentioned in the foregoing grants, vis. ri-Rama, Niravadya,Anivarita and Dhanamjaya. Panyavallabha was evidently the family name. Niravadya seems to have been a liruda, originally of king Vijayaditya and Anivarita of his son VikramadityaII. In due course, Niravadya became the name of 
the vmter of Vijayaditya'a grants and Anivarita of his son who wrote the KaSchi inscription of Vikramaditya II. The latter wpa apparently engraved not long after the accession of Vikramaditya, who seems to have conqueredthe Pallava capital soon after his coronation. The name Niravadya Srimad-Anivarita Punyavallabha has probablyto be explained as"the 
illustrious Anivarita-Punyavallabha (son of) Niravadya." Anivarita's son was apparently Dhanamjaya, who in the earlier Kendur inscriptioncalls himself Dhanamjaya-Punyavallabha, but prefixes the name of his father in the later Vakkaleri plates.

N0.3.-.BIJAPUB INSCRIPTION OF DHAVALA OF HASTIKUNDI; VIKEAMA-8AMVAT 1053. 
BY PAKDIT RAM TLiBW.; JODHPUB, 
A short paper on thig inscription has already been written by the late Professor Kielhorn,8 But as the full text of the inscription was not published by him, I was induced "by Mr. D. R, Bhandarkar to prepare a fresh transcript, as far as practicable, with the helpof the original stone which has now been Bent to the Ajmer Museum by the kind permissionof His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur, 
The inscription was originally discovered by Captain Burt"in the interior of a gateway leading to Mandii, distant one /cos from Beejapoor, on the route from Odeypore to Sirohi near Mount Abu."3Bat, accordingto local report, the stone was originally fixed in the wall of a solitary Jaina temple situated about 2 miles from the village of Bijapurin the Ball (Godwar) District of the Jodhpur State, It wag subsequently removed to the dharmafalS belonging to the Jaina mahajans of Bijapur, whence it was broughtto the Historical Depart*- ment of the State and is now keptin the Ajmer Museum. 
There are 33 lines of writingia this inscription covering a spaceof nearly2' Sf broad by 1' 4" high. The record is, on the whole, in a fair state of preservation ;a considerable portion of it has, however, suffered from the effects of the weather. The first and second lines are very much worn out, There are, besides, a few letters here and there which have peeledoff. The size of the letters is about f"and the characters are Hagari (o the northern class of alphabets) 
1[The donee's name has to be looked for in this compound ; perhaps qiSK'qmffffi** meant. 3 Jour, of the U fioo. of $engd, Vol. IiXII. Part I, No, 4, pp, 809-14.

resembling the Harsba inscription of Yigraharajaof Yikrama-Samvat 1080,as remarked bythe late Professor Kielhorn.

Generally, the anusvara has been used, yet instances "oi tasal compoundsare also to be met with, e,g.in ^Kanjanaswnda ,line 5. There is verylittle difference between r and &. In some places yhas wronglybeen engravedforj>* $ and s haw sometimes been confonnded. The sign for the upadhmaniyaoccurs onlyonce ( line 1 ) and its form is worthyof note,1 There are ornamental decorations below the word &ri occur ring thrice in the last line (32), 
Practically speaking, there are two separate inscriptions incised on one and the same stone. The first ia dated [Vikramaj-Samvat 105B (11, 19 and 22) and the date of the second is tlie Vikrama year 996 (11. 31 and 82). The first inscription extends from line 1 to line 22 and consists of 40 versea3 of a prasasti composed by Suryacharya (1. 21). The prasasti openswifcfc two verses in praiseof the Jinas, or TIrtha&karas as theyare also called. Yerse 3 apparently mentions a royal family whose name is unfortunately lost, In verse 4 we are introduced to prince Harivarmaa and his wife Buchi. From Harivarman sprang Vidagdha (v. 5), 'who is described in the second partof theinscription as a Rashtrakuta. Vasudeva was the preceptorof Yidagdharaja (v. 6), who imparted to the prince spiritual knowledge and induced him to erect a temple dedicated to the god Jina in the town of Hastikundi. The prince had himself weighed against gold, of which two-thirds were allotted to the god and the remainder to the Jainspreceptor ( Yaandeva }. Yidagdha was succeeded by Mammata (v, 8) and Mariuaata by Dhavala (y. 9), The last princeis enlogized in no less than ten verses. In Terse 10 he is eaid to have given shelter to the armies of a king whose name is lost and of the lord of the Gflrjaras, when MufijarSja had destroyed IghSta, the prideof Medapata (Mewar) and caused them to flee, ThisMuSjaraja,as correctly pointed oat bythe late Professor 
Kidhora, must be the same aa VSkpati-Mnfija of M51w5 for whom we have the dates V,S,1G31, 1036 and 1050, The lord of ihe Gfirjaras here referred to was probably no other than the ChaulTikya sovereign Mftlarija I. himself mentioned in verse 12 telc-w, The prince whose name is not dear, was perhapsthe ruler of Hedapata, and it seems temptingto read his 
name Khflmana, bat he appearsto have flourished long priorto the time of MuSja and can not, therefore, bereasonably taken to be his contemporary. AgUta, which Munjaraja destroyed, is doubtless Aha4, Dear the present Udaipur station, from whioh a well known GehlSt clan derives its name, vis, Ahadiya, In verse 11 Dhawla ia spoken of as havingafforded protection to Maheadia against DurlabharSja Dml&bharS;f* ia correc% recognised bythe late Professor Kifilhom to be the prbcaof that name, who was the brother of the ChShamSna Tigrabarftja of theHwsha inscription dated Y.S, 1030.5 The name of Durlabharajaalso occurs in the Bij&lva ad Ki]?s&r& uworiptJoBfi. Mah&aiira has been eorrecilyidentified bythe same learned professor with Mahtoira, son of Yignfchap&la, and grandson of Laksbnana in his paper on "Tb Chahamanw of Naddftla."* In versa 12 Dhavala is said to have given support to Dhara^ivarlha, WBOW power had beencompletely exterminaied by Mnlaraja, The last prace is nnqttas&mably*Chanlnkya swemgn of that name, as said above.

of that name -who accordingto tradition was the ruler of Nav-k5t Marvrar, arid who is reported in an ancient Hindi verae to have distributed the nine forts ( nav-kot ) amongathis brothers.1 Verses 13-18 bestow conventional praise on Dhavala without conveying anyhistorical information. Yerae 19 tells us that he renounced the world, in his old age, after having 
placed his son Balaprasada on the throne. The following two verses againare merely eulogistic. Verse 22 says that the capitalof Balaprasada was Eastikundika ( Hathundi). Verses 23-27 are devoted to the descriptionof Hastibindi and contain nothing historical. The next two verses speak of a stiri named Santibhadra who is mentioned in verse 30 to be the pupilof Vasudeva, doubtless the preceptorof Vidagdharajareferred to above in verse 6. Verae 33 in forms us that the goslithi of Hastikundi renovated the templeof ( Rishabhanatha ), the first Tirtharhkara, In verses 36-37 we are told that the temple had first beon built by Vidagdha raja, but that after^itsrestoration the image was installed by Santibhadra in the ( Vikrama-) year 1053, on the 13th of -the bright half of Magha. In the verse following,it is stated that Vidagdharaja had made a grantto the temple when he had himself weighed against gold and that afterwards Dhavala in conjunction with his son made a gift of a well called Pippala. Verse 39 expresses a wish for the permanenceof the temple, and verse 40 saysthat the prasasti. was composed by Siiryacharya. Then follows in prose the data given above, but with more details. It is Sunday, the 13th of the bright half of Magha of the Vikrama year 1053 when Pushya was the nakshatra. Accordingto the late Professor Kielhorn, this corresponded to Sunday, the 24th January A.D. 997 , when the 13th tithi of the brighthalf ended 7 h. 40 m. after mean sunrise.3 On this date, the god Rishabhanatha was installed and the flag was hoisted. We are further informed that Mulanayaka} Let the original image before renovation, had been set up by certain members of the gSshfchi, whose names are enumerated. 
The second part of the inscription, which is in itself an independent record, consists of 21 verses and extends from lines 23 to 32. This seems to have been added to the first because it specifies certain endowments made in favour of the same Jaina temple and the same Jaiua preceptor as are mentioned in the first. The genealogy aa far as Mammata is also repeated here. It opens with the praiseof the Jaina religion. There lived a prince named Harivarma (verse 2) who was succeeded byhis son Vidagdharaja. The latter is described as"the kalpa vriksha of the garden which was the illustrious Rashtrakuta race"(verae 3). Jromhim sprang Mammata ( verse 4 ). From verses 5-7 we learn that the temple had baen originally erected by Vidagdha for his guru Balabhadra and Mammata renewed the grant made by Vidagdha in favour of him, the nature of which is described in verses 8-17, via. (1) one rupeefor each twenty loads ( pravahana or pofha ) carried for sale; (2) one rupee on each cart filled ( whether going from or by the village ) j (3) one Tsarslia for a glided, at each oil-mill; (4) 13 chollikas (?) of betel leaves by the Bhattasj (5) Pellaka-pellaka (?) by the gamblers ; (6) one adhaka ( =4 seers ) of wheat and barley from each araghatfa,i.e. well with a water-wheel ; (7) five palas for pedda (?) ; (8) one vimsopaka* coin for each hhara (=2,000 palas)', (9) ten palas from each bhara of articles, such as cotton, copper, saffron, gum-resin ( pura, i,,e, guggulw ), madder, and so forth;and (10) one m&naka for each drona of wheat, mitng, barley, salt, rsla, and such other objects as can be measured. This is what was granted by Vidagdha-

No. 4 KUBUSPAL STONE INSCRIPTION OF SOMESVARADEYA. BY RAI BAHADTJE HIRA LAI, B.A; NAGPER.   
The subjoined inscription was found afc Kuruspal, a villagein the Bastar State, by Rai Bahadur Diwau Baijnath, who kindly sent me impressionsof it together with a transcript from the original stone. I, however, waited for better impressions from the Archooological Department and these I received hi due course, bat as the writingis illegible owingto the roughness and bad state of the stone,it has not been possibleto .secure very satisfactory copies. Under the eircutnBtanoes I have not been able to decipher the record satisfactorily and the difficulty has been aggravated bythe fact that almost the whole of the left side of the stone is broken ofi carrying away about 5 OP 6 letters of many lines j and some letters on the right side also are gone.It seems almost impossibleto restore the lost portion and it is unfortunate that some letters belonging to proper names have disappeared, However, there is still enongh left to invest the record with some importance.I have, therefore, endeavoured to elicit this portion without paying much attention to the unimportant passages, such, for instance, as those enumeratingthe names of the inhabitants or castes which I have mostly allowed to remain as read byMr. Baijnath from the original stone, from line 24 to the bottom. The record contains altogether 39 lines covering a space3' 8" x 2' on the stone, which in its present mutilated form measures 5' 3'' x 2' 4", These are the greatest lengths and breadths which are not uniform throughout, because the stone is broken on all aides. The characters are bold aver aging about 1", but many of them are worn out. They belong to the tfagarl alphabet, those appearing in the antiquated form being i, e, cha, na> dha, &&&, ra, fa, and sa. The languageis Sanskrit, partly prose and partly verse, the compositiorvuot beingfree from grammaticalor spell ing mistakes. The bimdas or familytitles from the commencement to Hue 6 are in prose, the composition being ID a style somewhat characteristic of the southern records; compare, for instance, the Nadagam platesof Yajrahasta (above, Tol. IV. p, 189). From line 21 there is again prose dealirg with the business portionof the record, which ends with the usual imprecatory verses and the engraver's name, etc., in prose,Underneath the record are carved the figures of a cow, a Utiga, a dagger, a shield and the sun, the signification of which as imprecatory symbols has been elsewhere explained.1 
The inscription- records the grant by king Somgs'varadeva of a village whose name cannot be made out, but from the boundaries it appearsthat to its south was the Indranadi and to its east a village named Aranga and to the -west Kapalika. The name of the village to the north is also not clear. The birucZos of the familyto which SomSeVaradgva belonged correspond to those mentioned in the Narayanpal3inscription with a few additions and varia tions- They state that the king belongedto the NagavamSa and to the Kasyapa gotra. He had a tiger crest and snake banner and acquired sovereigntyof Chakrakuta through the favour of the goddess Vindhyavasini. In connection with the last liruda I have already referred to this inscription (above, Vol. IX. p. 179) where I have shown that Chakrakuta lay somewhere near the present capital" of Baatar, The personal eulogyof the king who is styled Maharajadhiraja Paramabhattaraka Parmesvara, informs us that Someevara was the son oE Dharavarsha, whose grandson was Kanharadeva.8 The latter was only heir-apparentat the time our inscription was engraved. There is nothing new in this genealogyas we already

s [This statement refers evidently to the Ktmharadeva. mentioned in L'7 of the text. It is, hrwever, open to question if this Dharavanh* la identical with his namesake mentioned in 1. 11,in view of the fact that a king named Nagatideva ia introduced in 1. 0. Asrftin, there is no necessityto mention the grandsono{ Dharavarsha in I. 7, as the record belongs lo the time of his son S6mo(vara. But fta the inwription is considerably damaged, the qncBtion must be left to be decided by fntnre researches, - Ed,]
r-. IUWH union.* The subjoined record, however, refers to certain   
contemporary tings, and had the whole of this portion been capableof being decipheredot restored, it would probably have solved some important historical problems, Most of these kings are mentioned here by the names of their countries or capitals, those qniteclear being TJdra, Lafiji, Eatnapura, Lemna, Vengi, Bhadrapattana} and Vajra. Owing to the mutilated state of the record it is not certain whether Ssme^vara claimed to have conquered them, but one in> plication ia,plain, vis. that they were his rivals. In verse 8 it is stated that, havingkilled tho powerful Hug HadnurSntaka in battle and having put other kingsto trouble, he became, as it were, a junior Narayana by imitatingthe latter's action in havingkilled Madhura and a host oi other demons. Tho next two verses speakof the burningof Vgagi and subjugation o Bbadra pattana and Vajra, his greatest exploit apparently being the killing of Madhuranfcaka. From his RSjapura plates3 the latter appearsto have occupied Chakrakuta, of which Somesvara claimed to be the hereditary ruler, The burningof capital towns seems to have been a favourite form of annoyance to unfriendly rulers and was perhaps regarded as a great achievement. Our hero boasts of having' burat Yengilike the great Arjuna who fired the Khandava forest.' Thia vras at the moat a tit for tat, as we find Cbakrakuta itself burnt several times bythe Hugs of tho countries on the other aide of the Gfldavari (see above, Yol. IX.p. 179). Verigi was the country between the Godavarl and the Krishna,3 and our inscription mentions the name of "Viraehoda, who, as we know from other sources, was the viceroy4 of this country appointed byhis father. Ssmesvara eeema to have added another laurel to his fame by burning the forests of the- Yajra country. The acme of exaggeration ia reached in the vainglorious boast contained in the llth verse in which it 
is stated that Somfsvara took 6 lakhs and 06 villagesof the Kosala country. Of course Kosala here refers to Mah5-K5sala or Dakshina-Kosala r> hich extended from the confines of Berar to Orjssa and from Amarakantaka to his own territory in Bastar, It is doubtful whether even this extensive area ever contained as many as 6 lakhs ofvillages, but even supposingthat it did, there is absolutely nothing to justify the boast that Sflmesvara ever became kingof that country.It is possible that he may have raided a partof KCsala and may have held it in his possessionuntil driven out again. This surmise seems to be supported by Jajalladeva'a5inscription dated 
1114 AD, Jajalladeva was king of Dakshina-KOsala rulingat Ratanpur, and in his eulogy referred to above, ho is state! to have' seized in battle Somesvara, havingslain an immense army/ No details are given as to who Somesvara was, but from synchronistic allusions it is apparent that he was identical with the donor of our inscription. The Karayanpal6epigraph, which is dated 1111 A.D., explicitly mentions that Kanharadeva became king on the death of 
Sera&vara, and we know from the Barsur? inscription that he was living in 1108 A.D. The B&tanpur epigraph was engraved in 11U and these datea are so cloao to each other as to leave little doubt in the matter. 
Returning to the list of countriep, we know Udra to be the old name of Orissa, Lanji,8 a well-known tract in the district of BalSghgr, Katnapara, the capital of the Haihayas in Dakabi^Ksaai*, and V$iigi, the country between the Gsdavari and Krishna, Lemna may ba Lavaua, the eastern tract of the Raipur district, So far, the inscription does not give us any 
new information, but the remaining two names, m Yajra and Bhadrapatfcana, are interesting. Vajra or Vayirfigajam. 13 mentioned in Tamil literature and inscriptions.9 The earliest reference to Yajra is peihapain the Tamil poem Sihppadi^ran^ which is believed to have between 110 and UO A.D.

was on terms of friendship with tlie kings of Vajra, Magadha, and Avanti. How Vajra fared in later times there are no materials at present to elicit, but duringthe 10th and llth centuries it was apparently not so important or strong as in the early agea. A noteworthy fact is that iu Tamil inscriptions it is always mentioned in conjunction with Chakrakota or Sakkarakkottam, 
and since I have localised the latter in Bastar, it will now be easyto see why Vayiragaram must be Wairagarh which adjoinsthe Bastar State and is situated not veryfar away from the place where the old Chakrakuta lay. This inscription itself confirms the identification of Chakrakufa wifch Bastar, as it calls SomeavaradeYa faxe lord of Chakraktita, and the happy quibble which the composer of our inscription has introduced in regard to the name Vajra1referringto diamonds and its conqueror as a' diamond piercer,' to my mind definitelysettles the question of the identification which does not appearto have been suggested or attempted before. Waira garh was a well known diamond mine in olden days and it continued to be famous even in the times of Akbar to which the following quotation from the Alii-i-A'kl&ri'*' testifies :( Kallam3 is an ancient city of considerable importance ;it is noted for its buffaloes. In the vicinityis a zamindar named Babjeo o the Gond tribe, more generally known as Chanda ;a force of 1,000 horse and 40,000 foot is under his command. Biragarh which, has a diamond mine and where figured cloths and other stuffs are woven, ia under his authority.It is but a short time since that, he wrested it from another chief. Wild elephants abound.1 The final note of Abul Jazl about wild elephants incidentally enables us to see how it was that Rajendra-OhoJa (Kulottunga I.) carried off many herds of elephants from VayirSgaram mentioned in the Tiruvojr.iyur inscription.4 This is a further confirmation of the identityof the place. Should additional evidence be required as to Wairagarh having been a capitalof ruling kings,it ia furnished by its ancient remains5 and the strong local tradition6 according to which a line of Mana kings held sway for some time. Mana or Mam is a semi-aboriginal caste, whose origin is obscure. They say that they came from Manikgarhin the Nizam's Dominions and my belief is that they were a branch of the Nagavamsi kings who worshipped Durga under the name of Manikyadevi.7 
1 It may be noted that the correct name of Waiiagarh is Vajrakara, which means' diamond mine' aud has nothing to do with garh or fort. The real meaning having been forgotten, folk-etymology steppedin averring that the name meant the ' fort o Waira/ a contraction of Vairaba, a ubiquitous king, whose capitals are found spread over numerous parts of India. The story spun out, while it tickled the prideof the loftal people, brought conviction home in view o! the fact that a fort existed there. This fort is, however, a modem one (aeo Ctfauingham'a Reports, Vol. VII. p. 127). 
2 Jamtt's Edition, Vol. II. pp. 229 and 280. Even priorto this, the Musalmans -knew of the Wairagarh diamond mines. In the Surhdn-i Ma, d*t> from which MajorJ. S. King has compiled a history of the Bahman! dy nasty, it is stated that in the year 879 (A..D. 1474) Sullen Muhammad Shah II, sat in state on the throne and gave a public audience to the amirs and nobility and in elegant language explained as follows:-" The announcers of news, have informed me that the district of Wairagadh which is in the possession of Jatak Eaya,the ungrateful, is a. mine o diamonds j and I am resolved that that district also, like all the others, shall be brought into the possession of the servants of this court ; aud that in those districts the rights of Islam shall be introduced aud the symbols of infidelity and darkness be obliterated." It is stated that one 'idil Elan was sent on this mission. He laid 'siege to the fortress at Wairagarh, whereupon Jatak Eaya surrendered (Ind. Ant. Vol. XXVIII. p. 286). * Now in the Yeotmal district of Berar. It is quiteclose to Chanda.

6 Col. Luia Smith's Settlement Eeport of Ch5n.da listriot (1869), p.61. The datea given in this report ure conjectural, because the Colonel thought that the Gonds conqueredthe country about 870 A.D., and therefore the Mania being their predecessors must have ruled before this. In the Chanda District Gazetteer (1309) it has been, however, clearly shown why the Gauds could not have come into possessiono Chanda until the 13th or 14th 
century A..D. 
i See for instance above, Vol. III. p. 318, where SomisVara is called' a worshipperof the heavenly and holy lotus feet of the blessed Maciikyadevi,1 See also Elliott's Eeport on the Dependencyof Baafcar (1861), page 18, where he says that the present family of Bafltar Rajas were worshipping the goddess' Mankeshwarea'before they came to Bastar and that on their coming here she assumed the name of' Dnnteshwaree* under which appellation she is still worshipped. My own belief is that with the change of the dynasty the old name of the goddess was 
changed and tbe Mauikyadevi of the Nagavamiis became the DanteSvafl of the present family.E2
[VOL, %

The goddess, apparently, gave her name to the fort and to her woi-shippers, who, on being ousted mixed with the local Gonds.and deteriorated so aa to be regardedas a branch of the Gkrad tribfr Apart from all these considerations, there ia epigraphical" evidence of the existence of a family of chiefs at Wairagarh who are mentioned in th& Ratanpar inscriptionof JajaHadeva1 (dated 1114 AJX) as paying tribute to the Haihayasof Dakshina-Kosttla. The reference to Bhadrapattana, which is merely a variant of Bhadravati for metrical purposes,is againa pointof great import' auce, because while on the one hand it affords still another proofof Wairagarh's identity, on the ether hand it confirms what I have els&where endeavoured to prove, ms, that the present Bhandak is the old BhadrSvati.3 Our inscription mentions Bhadrapattanain; conjunction with tho Yajra country,, which shows that it was quite close to Vajra, Yajra heing Wairagarh,. 
there is no place in its vicinity answeriDg fco Bhadrapattana except Bhandak, which is only about 70 miles from Wairagarh, There can be no doubt as to the antiquityof the place, _and local tradition strongly supportsits identification with Bhadravati. It once enjoyed the cele brity of being the capital of Maha-K$sala and it was this place which Hiuen Tsiang visited. With regard to the geographical names occurringin the grant portion of the inscription,the villages Aranga and Kapalika I am unable to trace, bnt Indranadi is the present IndrSvatij about a mile from Karuspal which flowed through Ohakrakuta. The modern representativeof Chakrakata is probably ChitrakSta which may be a corruption of the older name.

No. 5.-TWO KURTJSPAL INSCRIPTIONS OS1 DHABANA-MAHADEYI OF THE TIME OP SOMESVA-RADEVA. 
BY RAI BAHADTTR HIBA LAI,, B.A. ; NAOPTIR. 
KnruspSl is a village about a mile off from Karayanpal1 and 22 miles from Jagdalpur, the capital of tlie Bastar State. Tlie name is probably a corruption o Krisliaapiira as Narayanpal is of Narapnapura. Tlie place contains numerous mius, among which there is a tank called B&ni Tarai. The first of the subjoined inscriptions had been built upside down in one of the stepsof this tank and was found by Bai Bahadur Diwan Barjnath who supplied me with 3 impressions together with one of another fragmentary stone found in a field.2 The tank slab probably belonged to a temple built in the middle of the tank, and dedicated apparentlyto the god Kftmesvara (Siva) referred to in the inscription. Both these inscriptions record the grant of land near Kalamba (now untraceable)> and the gift was made in both cases by queen DhSrana-Maliadev!, who was apparentlythe consort3 of Somesvaradeva. This Dharana MahadevL is also mentioned in the Narayanpal inscription, apparentlyas a transferer of the land granted by Gunda-Mahadevi. It is worthy of note that some names of the recipients mentioned

there (for instance Mahariaka Devadasa) 'also figurein the tank slab, The latter also mentions certain tenants who are stated to be residents of Narayanapura and Temara, both of which are close to Euruspal, The subjoined inscriptions appearto be older than the Narayanpalrecord of 
Saka 1033, Both say that they were issued duringthe reigno Maharajadhiraja Somesvara deva, who had of course died priorto Saka-Samvat 1033, Neither of them is dated, but on the tank slab I have read the name of the safnvatsara as Saumya,which priorto S. 1033 fell in 1 991. It therefore appears that they were jssued about the year 1069 A,D, SsmgSvaradSva is stated to be born of the Naga race and has all the Urudas attached to his name as in the Narayanpal inscription. The subjoined records afford no new historical information, but would perhaps be of some uso when finally fixing the periodsof leignof the Basta* branch of Steda kings. 
As farther inscriptions have been found in Kurttspal which will appearlater on,it seems necessary to add here the distinguishing features of. the slabs under notice. The tank skb measures 6' 10" X 2' 2" and the writing consistingo 26 lines covers 3' 4"x 2' 1", On the top is a linga in the middle with the sun and the moon to the left and 5 circles in a row to the right, probably representing the remaining5 planets which givetheir names to the week days and indicating that the grantis to last aa long-as theyendure. At the bottom are engraveda cow, a dagger and shield and a donkey associating- with a pig which is an obscene impreca tion explained in the test, 
The fragmentary slab ia 49" long and 15" or 16" broad. There are 16 lines of writing on it, most of which ate incomplete. Th& first 3 lines together with portions of the fourth, and fifth are on a piece altogether broken ofi from the main slab. The greatest lengthof tlie space covered by the writing is 27" and breadth 15". The slab has no figures on the top, but at the bottom there are the same figuresas on the tank slab. 
The tank slab was engraved byone Damodara Sntradhara. The averagesize of the letters which are NSgari is lff, The languageis bad Sanskrit with the exception of the stereotyped lirudavali. The noticeable orthographical peculiarityis that in some, plsbes fa is used for t/a as in line 11. The fragmentary inscription does not give, the name of its' engraver, The average size of its letters is 1|".

No. 6.] SUNARPAL STONE INSCRIPTION OF JATASBIHADEVA. 35   
No. G.-StTNAKPAL STONE INSCRIPTION OF JATASIMHADEVA. BT BAI BAHADUR HIEA Lit, B.A.; NAQPUE. 
Sunrp&l is a village about 10 miles from Narayanpal1 in the Bastar State. I think the name is a corruption of Suvarnapura, which -was probably prevalent duringthe rule of the NagavamSi kings of Bastar, A fragmentary inscriptionof that dynasty was found here by Rai Bahadur Diwan Baijnath who kindlysent me 4 impressions from which I edit it.2 The slab on which it is inscribed measures 4/xl'5J"and the writing covers 4'xl' 5" including the imprecatory figures at the bottom which occupy6". These figures are a cow and a calf, a dagger and shield, a liilga and the sun and the moon as found in other Nagavaihsi inscriptions. The upper layer of a portionof the left comer at the top has gone off damaging the first 5 lines which deal with the lirudas of the king, but they can be restored from other allied records. The writingis bold, but weather-worn. The characters are NSgarL The average size of the letters is 1*. The inscription seems to have been composed by a person who knew very little of Sanskrit, if at all. He had no doubt committed to memory the birudas of the ruling king, but where long samasas were involved, he remembered only portions of them and wrote them down without caring whether they conveyed any meaning or not. For instance, in lines 6 and 7 we find fcanja-knjaZfea-ptt^-ptnjar^a-67iramcirai/owiawa for maha'Mahesvard'cliarafia Jcanja-Unjdlia-pitnja'pinjanta-lJiramarayama'rua, His imprecatory verses at the end are t 'milarly amusing. He seems to have been a native of the United Provinces which may be inferred from the vernacular word' dinha' (gave)of which apparently he did not know the Sanskrit equivalent. He has, however, endeavoured Ms best to give his composition a Sanskrit look and we may therefore allow that the languageis Sanskrit and pass on without referring to orthographical peculiarities, as theyare merelyblunders.'' 
The inscription is of no importance exceptingthat it famishes the name of a new NagavamsT king which will be useful in making out a dynasticsiiBt, It gives no date, nor does it mention the name of the place where the grant was made. It does not even say what was granted, bnt from the imprecationsit may ba inferred that it was some land. Perhaps J=dhakada was the name of the village granted. The gift was apparently made by the queens of Jayasimhadeva of the Niga race, who belongedto the Kasyapa-06fra and was the supreme lord of BhogSvati, having the "tiger with, a calf as his crest. He is called Rajadhiraja Maharaja sri-Jayasim.h&de"va. The names of witnesses before whom the grant was made are recorded as usual. 
In line 11, the pauchapradhan[ah'], i.e. the five ministers, seem to be mentioned. Four of them are enumerated. But the fifth is not mentioned as such. In Eastern Chalukya copper plate grants, the king generally makes gifts in the presenceof the matrin (councillor), purshittt (.family priest), senapati (commander of the army), ymaaraja (heir-apparent) and the dawm-rika (door-keeper). The executors of the Chellur platesof V!ra-Ch8<Ja and of the Pithapuranj plates of the same king are said to be the pamoha-pradhanah, i,e. the five ministers.

No. 7. KURUSPAL STONE INSCRIPTION OF SOMESVARADEVA; SAKA-SAMVAT 1019. 
Br RAI BAHADUR HIEA LAL, B.A.; NAGPUK. 
If the remoteness and inaccessibility of Kuruspalin the Bastar State of the Central Pro vinces have prevented the antiquarian from witnessingits ancient remains, temples, tanks, ^ells and gardens, the publicationof inscriptions from that place have at least made him familiar with its antiquity and the importance it onco enjoyed about a thousand years ago. IJOCE! tradition avers that there were in that quondam town Sat upar sat fron baoU or 147 step-wells and as many tanks, -and Rai Bahadur Baijnath, Diwanof Bastar, assures me that the story has a great deal of truth in it, Among the ruins on the bank of a tank known as Chorya-tarai was found the present record, which like its three predecessors refers to the reign of the NSgavamsi king Somesvaradeva. There is, however, an agreeable departurein that it is dated. This is a point which renders its publication imperative in spite of the mutilated and extremely bad condition of the stone on which it is inscribed. The stone in fact is not e^ whole. It is broken into two pieces, and erosion has had its ample share in obliteratingthe letters. The stone with both the pieces put together measures 5' 0|"x2;1|'', the length of the inscribed portion being 3' 1" with 24 lines, each about 2' 1" long. Tho average size of the letters, which belongto the HSgarl alphabet,is about 1'', The language is Sanskrit prose and there are no peculiarfeatures in orthographyother than those found and noticed in other inscriptions from Kuruspal. 
The object of the inscriptionis apparentlyto record a dedication of a lamp to the god LE6]kesvara by the inhabitants of a village not named. It appearsthat a subscriptionof 11 gady&nakas (coins) was raised by them. The dedication was made 'in the !aka year 1019 during the victorious reignof the illustrious Somesvaradeva, who belongedto the STaga family, who was the lord of Bhogavati, the best of cities; the space between the ten quarters was resounding with the deep sound from the shrill drums proclaiming whose brilliant victories ; whose crest was a cow aiid tiger; who was, as it were, the sun to the lotus of the Chhinda family j ,who resembled a bee which was rendered yellow by the mass of the pollen on the lotus, i.e. the feet of the great (god) Mahesvura j who was the store-house of statesman ship ;who was the shelter of the whole world ; -who was like Arjuna.in usingthe bow ; who was the lord of kings ; who was by birth as beautiful as the godof love ; who was terrible to his opponents (Pratigandabhairava) ; who was like Purtiravas among kings ; who resembled the demi-gods in enjoyments ;who was brave like Narayana, gloriouslike Indra, true like Haris"- chandra, and in subduing passion,like Mahadeva^ and who had acquiredhis kingdom by the force of his own arms.' In this birudvvali, some of the titles are noteworthy as they wero also borne by Madhuraatakadeva of the Bajapura plates,1 whom S5mesvaradva is stated to have 
>. battle in the long inscription found at Kuraspal.3 This would mean that both to the same family, and that Somesvara killed his relative and himself became a king, lot, however, appear necessary to discuss this pointbefore the Telugu inscriptions of are published. 
fturning to the date,it is to hi regrettedthat all the originaldetails are not available to the stou-' Divingbroken off. The only thingthat can be gleaned with certaintyis } r.altskatra Svati, the day which looks like Sanaischara or Saturday, 
... A having become obliterated or lost. The figuresof the yearin the ,,ry indistinct, but Bai Bahadur Baijnath has satisfied himself from the 
L019. Luckily, the cyclic year IsVara-soiTH'a^ara is also given. From ^p. 181.*Aboye, p, 26.

He states that the Is van samvatsara occurred JQ the Saka year 1020, so the yearreferred to in the inscription must be the one which had expired1 and that in these two years, there was only one saptmlcombined with a Saturday and the Svati nakshatra, and this tithi belongedto the bright fortnight of the Sravana month in Saka 1020 current.

Temara is a small village adjoining Kuruspal in the Bastar State of the Central Provinces. The place contains some ancient remains from which the sail stone under notice was some how removed to Kuruspal, where it was found by Rai Bahadur Barjnath among the ruins of a temple. The stone has been, however, so longthere that it has got entangled amidst the roots of a Tendii (Dios'pyrus tomentosa)tree. Some portionof the stone is underground, hut the visible portion measures 6' 5" x 1' 7" and contains 14 lines of writingin Nagari characters covering a space 2' 4" x 1' 7". 
The letters are bold averaging 1|", bnt, owingto the roughness of the stone, some of them are not clear. The languageof the inscriptionis Sanskrit prose.It records the immolation of the illustrious Manikya[devi3 after the death of her husband at Ternara-ethana of Sairaharaja rajya, a district of Chakrakota-rashtra, duringthe reignof king HariSehandra, in the Saka year 1246. 
In -this record the place and date are important.It has been, I jtJjjnk, conclusively proved that Chakraktita was situated in Bastar and the fact -trf Tgmara being included in ifc ig a further confirmation of what has "been proved before.1 The date Saka- Samvat 1246 correspond ing to 1324 A.D., is the latest yet found of the period when the interior of the Basfcar country went by the name of Chakrakuta. The record being necessarilybrief does not give any clue as to what family king Harischandra belonged, and until otherwise proved, it does not seem unreasonable to supposethat he was of the same dynasty as the kingsof Chakr&kuta of the llth and 12th centuries, vis. the Chhinda or Sinda family of the Naga race. This record would, in that case, supply an additional historical name to the list of five kings known from other inscriptions and would show that the Nagavamsi rule at least continued to about the middle of the 14th century A.D.

No. 9.-TWO INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TIME OF THE NAGAVAMSI KING KA3SASIMHADBVA. 
Br RAI BAHADUR HIRA LAL, B,A. ;KAGPUR. 
When I visited the shrine of Dantesvari at Dantewara in the Bastar State in 1897, 1 saw a email stone pillar covered with Tehign. writing (onall sides,viz. the four faces and the top) fixed at the place where goats were sacrificed. It was then being used aa a yvpa? and tlio prie&ts of the temple did not know -what was written on it. My friend Rai Bahadur Baijnatb. sent me impressions from which the text was deciphered and a brief notice appearedin Vol. X2C . (p. IGo) of this Journal, Fresh impressionsTvere subsequently taken byMr. Venlcoba Rao, and I am indebted to Rai Bahadur V. Veukayyafor kindly revising the test after comparingit witli the fresh impressions. The slab on which it is inscribed is 2' 6'' high, the breadth of eaoh of the 4 faces being abont 7 J* and the topis consequently 7J" square. As stated above, tlie whole was covered with writing, bnt a portion has peeledoff carrying away the final por tions of almost all the lines of the third face and the beginningsof those of the fourth. Almost everything o the iccord on these 2 faces is lost. The engravingon the topis also mxicli damaged and in the impressions almost the whole of it is illegible. It appearsthat there wero altogether 43 lines on the 4 faces, and the top which appearsto contain the end had 7 lines, making a total of 50. On the topof the first face, there are figuresof the sun and the moon. Dantewara being south of the Indravati which,as I have said elsewhere, formed the boundary between the Nagarl and Telngu scripts, this record is in Telugu characters, The letters are bold and well formed with an averagesize of1J". So, ka and ra appear ia a somewhat antiquated form. Tho languageis Telugu. The object of the inscription, wa*apparently to record a gift,3 which was made on the lOfh day of the dark fortnight of Jyeshtha in the Saka year 1147,* duringthe reign of Jagadekabhfishana-MahSrSjft Narasimfaadeva, The date correspondsto 13tfc Jtme 12S4 A.D.6as calculated by Mr, G-okixl Prasad, Tahsildar of Bhamiari. It is not clear whether the grant was made by the Iciiajs himself or by some one of his subjects, but the phrase mmM*Naffatithlwdviiwahirajida> -rajy& etc, (11. 6 to 11),"die rtign of the illustrious Maharaja Narasimhadeva"seems to showthat it was some person other than the Maharaja who made a reference in this wise. 
The other inscription was found at Jatanpal, 40 miles from Dantewara. It i* situated to the north of the Jndritaitl and is inscribed in the Higati character on a slab measuring 4/ x 1'4, V,

almost the -whole of which is covered with big letters averaging 2". There are altogether 18 lines. Bet-ween lines 16 and 17 the imprecatory figuresof a pig followed by an ass are inserted. On the top of the inscription there are the figuresof the sun and the moon together -with 7 small circles in a row apparently representing the remaining 7 planets. The meaning of these is clear, The top figures denote that the grant is to last as long as the navagrahas or the 9 planets endure, -while the bottom figures representa curse on the transgressor of the gift declaring his father an ass and the mother a pig. The language is corrupt Sanskrit prose. The object is to record a grant of land made by one Kama" Hayaka to one Bahila Pan.de. Kama Nayaka appearsto be a subordinate of a chief named S5maraja under Maharaja Karasimhadeva. The mention of the mother Q-angadevi after the king's name is not clear. The date given is the Saka year 1140 without specifying any other details. It correspondsto 1218 A.D. In this year there was an eclipse of the sun and. the month, of Jyeshtha 'toas intercalary. So it was doubly meritorious to make a gift in that year. 
Narasimhadeva apparently belongedto the Nagavamsa dynasty. So'ne other longer inscriptions of this king have also been found in the Bastar State. Before these are published it will bo premature to mate any remarks about him.

o. 10.-NOTE ON THE AMABAVATI PILLAR INSCRIPTION OF SIMHAVAEMAN. BT PBOFESSOB E. HULTZSCS, Ps.D.j HALLE (SAALB), 
To Bai Bahadur Venkayya 1 am indebted for the fresh inked estampage of this inscrip tion, which is reproduced on the accompanying Plate. The text of the inscription was published in 1890 iu my South-Indian Inscriptions, Vol. I. No. 32. In the translation (lac. cU. p, 27) C would now substitute the following version of the first verse : 
u Let them grant you choice gloryfor a long time, those dust-particles on the feet of rlghana,3 which are hostile to worldly existence, (and) which glitter incessantly amidsfc the cluster of the rays of the jewels on the crests of the lords of gods and of demons ]" 
In tho NachricUen d, K. G. d. W> 9. Qottingen, 1903, p. 310 f., my late friend Professor Sielhorn has- shown that this verse is an imitation of the second of the introductory verses of 3Sna's Kadamban. 
The inscription does not contain a date, and the Pallava king Simhavarman to wlioec eign it belongs cannot be identified with any other Pallava king of the same or similar name, The approximate time of this record must therefore be settled onpalceographical gronnds. Che alphabet is what Dr. Burnell has called the transitional type of the Telugu-Kanarese iaracters.3 He notes as characteristics of this typethe four letters cha, dha, Ilia, and fa.

No. 1 still shows the old forms of the four test-letters. The new form of $ha, appears first in No. 2, and the open forms of cha and b ha in No. 3. In addition to these, the Teluo-u form of Ai is exhibited by Nos, 4-7 and bythe Amaravati pillar, which hasconsequently to be placed after No. 3. 
la order to settle the time of the Amaravati pillar within narrower limits, the letter ha may bo used. In Nog. 1-5, ag in the Amaravati inscription, the curve at its right end extends below the line, while in NOB. 6 and 7 it passes verylittle lower than the left portion of the letter and resembles already the normal Telugu shape. On the whole Noa. 4 and 5 agree moat closely vith the alphabet of the Amaravati pillar, which may therefore be placed between Nos 3 and ti; say about A.D. 1100.

The preservation of the inscriptionis good. The characters are Nagari and the language Sanskritt As regards orthography, v is used for b throughout, The dental sibilant occurs for the palatal in sakii for sakti (I, 2), dasa for dasci (I. S), asva for asva (1. 17), wisada for visada* (1. 20), and s&stra for sastra (1. 21). The palatalsibilant takes the placeof the dental in vasundkara for vasitndhara (11. 5 and 19), Vajasaneyafor Vajasaneya (L 11),A'?M<I for ^maj (1. 14) and Tahidha for vasudha (1, IS). The amisvdra is in many cases nofc clearly marked Final consonants are nofc distinguished, e.g. samvata is actuallywritten instead of samvat in, 1. 9 ; for pkalam in 1. 18 ; ua&#a for vaset in 1. 20;and pattama for pattarn in 1. 22. 
The record belongs to the Chandeila familycalled Chaadratreya1 in this (line 1)as well as in the other known inscriptionsof tho dynasty.2 The Chandellas were lords of Kalanjara (1. 4), i.e. Kalmjar, the well-known hill-fort situated in the Banda District, Bnndelkhund, of the United Provinces. The tract of country over which they ruled was called Jejabhuktlka or 
Jejabhukti3 (between tlie rivers Jumna and Narmada), apparentlyafter king Jeja, whom Kielhorn identified with Jayasakti,* one of the earliest kingsof the family. About tlie name Jejabhakti, Dr. Hultzsch remarks : "This old name of Bimdelkhand, the country which was ruled o\er by the Chandellas is the originalof the vernacular form Jajahutior JajabotI, just as the modern Tirhut is derived from Tirabhukti."5 
Our inscription opens with a verse in praise of the Chandratreya family and.then refers to kings Jayasakti and Vijayasakti o! the same family. The record then registers a gift by the Paramabhattaraka Maharajadhiraja Paramesvara, tlie glorious Paramardideva, an ardent worshipper of Mahesvara, wlio meditated on the feet of the P. M. P. sri-Madanavarmadeva who, in his turn, meditated on the feet of the P. M. P. sri-Prithvivarmadeva. While at Vilasapura Paramardideva granted land in the villageof Lauva within the rishayti of Karigava, The grant was made on Wednesday, the eighth tithi of the dark fortnight of Karttika in Samvat 1233, expressed b 3th in words and in figures. Tho donoe was a Brahmana named Pandita6 Kesavasarman of the Kasyapa-^ra,'who was a student of the Yrijasaneya-sakhtl, had the three pravaras oE Kasyapa. Avatsfu-a and Naidhrava and had come from the Bhathi grahara called Mutaiisha. He was the son of the Dvivedin TIkava, grandsonof Ra (?) Tihunapala and great-grandsonof Chan Valahava. The doctuneiit was written by Subhananda of the Vastavya race7 and engraved by Palhana, son of Rajapala, who is desci-ibed as a master of the art and craft (l^ftf^cRiJl^l, 1, 22). 
Without entering into the historyof the Chandolla dynasty,8 it is hero necessaryto atote that the inscriptions of Paramardideva, hitherto known, range, accordingto Kielhorn, from

Lovely lakes were also formed by them by throwing massive dams across the openings between hills.

A,D, 1167 to 120 1,1 while the date of the subjoined record corresponds to 27th October 1176 A.B. O.S. From other inscriptions3 we know that Paramardideva of Jejabbukti was conquered by the ChShamana king Prithviraja about 1182 A.D. On the 27th April A.D. 1203, the former 
surrendered the fort of Kalinjar to Kutb-ud-dia Aibak.3 From an inscriptionat Kalinjar we also learn that Paramardideva was a poet, He is said to have composed oat of innate faith a eulogy of the god Purari (Siva),4 
As regards the localities mentioned in the subjoined record, Lauva, the village in which the laud granted by the king lay, may be identified with Lewa,5 three miles west of Pachar. There arc several villages named Kargawan near Jhansi. By far tbe largest and most important of them ia one6 situated five miles north-east of Chirgaon and nine miles north-east of Paohar. According to tradition, Pachar, where the plate was unearthed, was itself known as Bilaspur about ten or fifteen generations ago and owned by Naik Brahma^as. If this tradition be true, king ParamardidSva mast have made the grant when he was encamped at Pachar, According to the Collector of Jhansi, there are"in Pachar distinct evidences of Chandel buildings, The chief is a small square temple, about eightfeet square and the same height of the nsaal Chandel pattern (of the simplest kind). It consists of roughly squared slabs and columns of granite carved in the leas elaborate Chandel style. This templeis situated in the heart of the village some 10 feet below the present level of the surface there. Stepslead down to it and the 'earth is prevented from falling in by a brick wall all round the space where the temple stands."7 
Another grant of Paramanlideva issued from Yilasapnraia engraved on the Ichchhawar plates found near the villageof Ichchhawar in the Pailani tahsil of the Banda District of the United Provinces. This grantis dated in Samvat 1228 corresponding to A.D. 1171 and was engraved by Palbana, son of Rftjapala,8 The Pachar plate was also engraved by the same man.* It ia therefore not impossible that both the Pachar and the Ichchhawar plates were issued from the Barae place, 
The dimensions of the land which was conveyed by the subjoined inscription are stated in terms of the quantity of seed required to sow the given area, ws. 7| &r5na$ of seed to be sown ia the manner specified in line 8 :

An exact determination of the superficial area is no longer possible. But it is interesting to compare a similar passage in a grantof the Chandella king Madanavarmadeva dated in Samvat 1190, which -was found in the Banda District and edited loy Kielhorn. Here the passage runs as follows : 
Our text is fuller and seems to explain aome of the terms 
about which Kielhorn waa in. doubt. Thus 3ni|J|oMIis the Sanskrit for the Prakrit form and describes the grain as sown broadcast, i.e. not as sown first in seed beds and then trans planted. Again, the compound tl^HTo^^RT^EI^f^, 'which 1 analyze thus : (1) 
(2) TUgnrafowre^T aJTOT gives precision to the phrase ^f^^f.So far learn that the land conveyed by Pararaardideva measured "ten ploughs,"i.e. it could be ploughed in one day by ten pairof oxen. The ploughing was to follow a certain method (vyavasthaya), namely, that of leaving a dividingline or boundaryafter each prastha, of seed sown. The total quantityof seed is (as in the earlier deed) 7|drdnas ; and it had to be sown broadcast. 
There remains the difficult word cffr'Sij which Kielhorn read as ^u^ in his text, adding a note that"it should denote some particular kind or kinds of grain." His suggestion is of course in complete accord with the syntax and the- generaldrift of the passage.It even tempts one to read SR^^ *n oar^^as a P^606 f careless engravingfor ^H^sf. If this somewhat bold expedient were adoptedsthe Sanskrit word Sjft^Jcf a8 ^ne equivalentof the current Hindi ^fj^psf^ would supplythe name of the common millet kodo, which may have been employed as the standard grainfor broadcast sowing. For the word ^T^ as it 
appears in our text, I can offer no Sanskyit equivalent.Tf it correspondsto the Mahrathi "dry", the sense of the whole passage would be : "As much land as may be covered by dronas of seed, in the dry condition, thrown broadcast."1 
TEXT. 
1 Aa to the method of measuring laud by the quantityof geed requiredto- sow it, the references to my hand are Elliot's"Ancient Tenure of land in the Mw&tha country" (Ind. Ant. Vol. XV. p. 268) and the Settlement Eeport of Jhanri, 1871> p. 125 ; hut tbia doei not throw much light on the word korada. [In one of the m-scrip taons of the Yaitllahhattasvamin templeat Gwlior, mention is made of land measured by the quantity o seed required to BOW it (ahove. Vol. I. p. 161) ; alio in a giantof the Valabhl king Dharaaena IV, (Ind. Ant. Vol. XV. p. 840, tert line 46 f). In the Tinnwcllydistrict of the Madras Presidency and in the Telugu country, land is 
often measured by the amount of id Tftpirdto BOW it or by the ampuut of grain prodaced by it.Ed,)

This plate has been discovered a short time ago on the estate of Balm Janakiballabh Prasad Narain Simha, Zamindar of Amauna3 Pargana Arwal, in the district of Gayii. Amaunfi is about 2 miles eaat by north of the well-known town and market-placeof Daudnagar on the east bank of the river Sou in the Gaya District. The plate has been lent to me throughthe kind offices of Mr. E. S. Greenshields, I.C.S., Collector of Gaya. 
[The text of the subjoined inscription has been printed with a translation in the Journal and Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,Yol. V. UTo. 5, May 1909, in an article entitled "The Mallayashtika grantof Kandana"by Mr. Paramesvar Dayal. There are a few differences in this transcript which will be pointedout in the footnotes. Accordingto Mr. Dayal,the plate was found in December 1907"in the fields of Bhendia Bigha, a hamlet of mauza Amauna. Ifc came to view after the surface soil had been washed away a little byrain. The site of the find is aaid to be an elevated land which is padtit uncultivated' and of the 'class called rerha, a kind of saline unproductive soil, on which even grass does not grow, and which becomes soft and loose in the rainy season. There are, however,no indications of ruins at this particular spot, thoughto the north-west of it, at a distance of about a quarterof a mile, is a t&ha' mound' considered to be the site of an old mud fort." Ed.] 
The plate consists of a single sheet of copper, 5J1' by llfV includingthe handle with a square hole on its proper right side, which may have been intended for the royalseal. It is, however, evident that no seal ever was attached to the plate. The inscriptionis written in eight lines on one side only. The characters agree with the alphabet, which was in use in North-Eastern India duringthe time of the Gupta kings, and I feel no doubt in referring the date in line 8 of the inscription (Samvat* 282}to the GuptaEra. Its European equivalent, accordingly, would be A.D. 551-2. The languageis Sanskrit, but not very correct. Thuai the spelling uchchhetta for tikshepta, in line 7, appearsto be due to the vernacular pronunciationof that time, and a little before, in line 6, the writer originally had confounded this word with akshSpa^for which he substituted its correct form later on. 
i[Mr. Dayal gives the dimensions of the original plateas 9J" x 5fc" excluding the handle. Ed-] 2 This -word la spelt Samvvatta. I have adoptedthe atove reading, which appearsto me the reading originally intended.H
50 EPIGRAPEU INDIOA. [VOL. X.   
The inscription records the grantof the village Mallayaehtika to a Brahmana, named Ravisvamin,1 who belonged to the Gargya-grotfm and tvas a student of theVajasaneyi-^fifcfoi. The grant was issued from Pudgala, a locality, which I have nob been able to identify, bythe Ma/nzraja Wandana, who lieldthe title of Kumaramatya? and "who describes himself as"medi tating over the feet of the king (diva*), and of his guru" (1.1), It is thns evident that the Maharaja Nandana was merely a feudatory chief, and it appears not altogether unlikely, that one of the later Gupta tings may have been the paramount sovereign to whom he owed allegiance. 
The date of the inscription (1. 8 : Samvat 200 30 2) doubtless refers to the G-upta era, and corresponds accordingly to A.D. 551-2. It is further specified as the 20th day of Magha. It is interesting to find the solar calendar in popularuse in Magadha, or Bihar, at such an early time; for it is well known that, at present, the agricultural year, governed by naltshatras, is solar in Bihar and in the United Provinces, while further to the east, in Bengal, a purely solar form, of the calendar has come into general use for almost all practical purposes, I cannot remember having met with many lunar dates in old inscriptions from Bihar, and a careful and systematic compilation of all the available dates in ancient epigraphs from. Bihar and Bengal may probably reveal to us the fact that the soli-lunar calendar of North-Western India was verylittle used in the north-east of India. and this again would afford a very striking analogyto the method of reckoning time, which still is made use of for agricultural purposes in Bihar. Dr. GHerson has lately called my attention to the remarkable fact, "that among the peasants of modem Bihar, the nafcsfcfffros are not lunar mansions, as they used to be from the beginning, but that among them only the position of the sun in connection with the nakshatras is taken into account. This cnrious custom, may, thus, very likely, go back to ancient times, and the introduction of the solar llahi year into North-Eastern India would, in that caae, appearto have been made easy on account of the existence there of a purelysolar form of the Indian calendar. 
The name of the engraver of the inscription appearsto have been Sudraka, if I am right in explaining the blundered words at the end of the inscription (1. S: Sudrakare faaksTwnafr) ag S&fcak@n=dtltirnafo "engraved by Sadraka." I may, perhaps, mention here, merely as a curiosity, that this name, famotuj to us as that of the author of the Mriohchhakatilea* occurs again in two other inscriptions from the Gaya District (Nos. 642 and 646 in Kielhorn's List4), one of which dates from the time of tfayapala, and the other from the time of Yaksha pala, probably 9th or 10th century A.D.*

No. 13. PARDI PLATES OF DAHRASENA ; THE YEAR 207. 
BY PROFESSOR E, HULTZSOH, PH.D.; HALLE (SAAM). 
I re-edit this inscription from some excellent ink-impressions kindly made over to me by Dr. Meet, who contributes the following remarks on tlie original copper-plates. "These plates were found in 1884 in the course of digging a tank at PSrdi, the bead-quar ters town of the Pardi subdivision of the Snrat District in Gnjarat, Bombay. The record on them was-bronght to notice and edited in 1885 by Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji, without a lithograph, in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XVI. p. 346 fi. "The plates are two in number, each measuringabout 9-^" by 3*. They are quite smooth ; the edges of them beingneither fashioned thicker nor raised into rims : but, as may be seen from the facsimile, the inscription is in a state of perfect preservation almost throughout. They are somewhat thin, so that the letters, though not very deep, show through on the backs of them, to such an extent that some of them can be read there. The inteiiors of the letters show marks of the working of the engraver's tool. 
"There is no ring of the ordinary kind, with a seal on it. But at each of the two ring holes the plates were held together by a long copper wire, |* thick in the thickest part, which, after being passed throughthe ring-holes, had its ends twisted over and round and round so as to form a kind of complicated tie, without the ends being soldered together. As the ring-holes are not much larger than the wires, and as the plates appear to have been secured as soon as 
they were discovered, it would aeem that these wires are the means bywhich the plates were fastened together ab inittio. 
"The weight of the two platesis 31 tolas, and of the two wires 1J tolas ; total, S2| tolas = oz." 
1 It looks as if the engraver had began to write IJiogyo, which he changed afterwards into the wrong form Ihoffyah. 
s A small dot over ra appearsto me merely a defect in the plate. 
1 The engraver clearly had written akghejpta first, on account of the well-known tloka, which lie had b 
mind. 
* A well-known blunder for akshlpta,, due to the vernacular pronunciation of the time.

the (Kalachuri) year 231 and records a grant by Vyaghrasenaof the Traikiataka familyi1 a facsimile of ihis record is much to be desired. It is worth noting that Dahrasena and Vyaghrasena style themselves on their coins parama-Vaisbnava,'a devout worshipperof Vishnu,' while tLe Pardi plates (1.1 f.) applyto Dahrasena the synonymousterm Bhagawt pada-karmakaray' a servant of the feet of Bhagaval' 
As regards the places mentioned in this record, Dr. Fleet2 understands the term Antar mandali-vishaya as denoting"the district of the territory between"the rivers Mindhola, on the north, and Purna, on the south, in Gujarat He identifies Kapura with a fairly large village on or near the southern bank of the Mindhola, three miles south-son th-weet from Vyara, the head-qnarters town of the Yyara subdivision of the Baroda State : the placeis shown as ' Kapura' in the Indian Atlas quarfcer-sheet No. 23, S. B. (1888),in lafc. 21 4', long, 73 25', He identiBes Kamyas-Tadakasarika,"the smaller or younger (later) Tadakasarika," with the ' Tarsari,'*Tarsari,' of maps,fifteen miles almost dne west from' Kapnra,' and about half way between the Mindhola and the Purna. And he considers that Amraka, where Dahrasena was encamped when he made the grant, may possibly be the*Ambaohh,'' Ambachh,' of the maps, about two miles towards 'the south-west from' Kapura': but he would observe that Amraka need not necessarily be anywherenear the other places mentioned in the record. He adds that Kapura gave its name to a territorial diyision, known as the Kapur-ahara, which is mentioned in a Nasik inscription of Ushavadata,8 and that the Chikhalapadra o that inscription is the' Chikhalda'of the maps, on the south bank of the MindhQla, two and a half miles east-north-east from' Kapura,'

No. 11 TWO KOLAMBA INSCRIPTIONS FROM DHAKMAPUEI OF THE 9TH CENTURY A.D. 
Br H. KRISHNA. SASTEI, B.A. 
The two subjoined records1are engraved on the four faces of a pillar which was removed in 1904) from Dharmapuri in the Salem District to the Madras Museum, where it is set upnear one of the entrances into the ArchaeologicalSection. The pillar measures 5' 4|" by1' 4'' on the east face, 5' 6|vby 1' 4" on the west, and 5' 5f by1' 3* on the north and south faces. It is surmounted by a pinnacle from which proceed in the eight directions eight petals which open downwards and are slightly raised at the edges where they meet the marginsof the pillar. Prior to its removal the pillar was built into the floor of a manfapain front of the Mallikarjuna temple at old Dharraapuri.9 The inscriptions OR it were copied byMr. G. Venkoba Bao early in 1901s and a brief note on their contents is found in the Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1900-01, p. 6, paragraph11, The pillar has suffered from the vandalism of ignorant people who appearto have used the stone for some purpose or other, with the result that all the four faces are worn smooth about the middle and bear big round indentations 5 to 5|inches 
1 Nos, 304 and 805 of the Madras EpigrapMcal collection for 1901. 
aThis is fche name by which an almost deserted quarter, about 1^ miles from the modern town of Dharmapnri, is known. It contains the temples of Hallikarjuna, Mariyamman and Visbnn. The tank en whose bund the inscribed slab No. 309 of 1901 (noticed helow, p, 64), was discovered, u also qnite close to this Barterof Dharmapuri. 
*Better impressions from which, the accompanying plate has been prepared were obtained by Mr. Venkoba Bao about the end of 1901. On this occasion he also copied another mutilated Nojamba record on a broken, pillar whijh wu lyingin the Mariyamman temple (No, 848 of f901 j see below, p, 63.)

in diameter, in which are lost one, two or more syllables in tliree consecutive lines on each of the foil? faces (11. 11 to 13 on the west face ; 11. 37 to 39 on the south face;11. 66 to 68 on the east face and 11. 95 to 97 on the north face). The north-east rim of the pillar,' at its lower end, is also damaged slightly and consequently, the end of 11. 79 to 83 on the east face and the begin 
ning of 11. 106 to 110 on the north face have disappeared. The latter gap (in the imprecatory verses) has, however, been filled up with the helpof similar passages occurringelsewhere. The break in the north-east rim has again, been the cause of one or more blanks in11.,8 and 9 of inscription B. Except for these defects, the two inscriptions are in a state of excellent preser vation and are written in old Kanarese characters of the period to which the inscriptions belong. They present a striking similarityto those of the Mantrawadi, Sirur and Nidagundi records edited by Dr. Fleet.1 
As regards palaeography, the initial vowels a, a, i, u and e occur in their usual forms (e.g. in 11. 7, 64, 52, 58 and 82). Long e when attached to consonants is distinguished from the short by a small loop made inside the circular i-mark at its base (compare, e.g. the i of palli with the of sme in 1, 55). In Tagadur (11. 36 and 40), in MtilapalU (11. 48 and 55), in Mulasamgha, (1. 47) and in Pw-ma- (L 33), the symbol for long u is marked in a slightly different way from the ordinary form of it as used e.g. in the of lhu in 11. 4., 97 and 107 (twice). This variant is like the subscript y with its bend to the left not quite pronounced. Short u affixed to the consonants fc and r is marked by a hook (bending downwards) attached to the rightside of the letter; whereas, in other cases it is a, vertical w-like tube affixed from below to the consonant to which it belongs, When the w-mark is lengthenedin the case of & and r a second hook (also turned downwards) is added the first, however, beingin this case, reversed for the sake of convenience. 1$ is marked by a similar hook attached to the left side of the talelsa^u,if one exists, or, somewhere on that side of the letter accordingto the whim of the writer. It may be noted that long e is denoted in a few instances^ by the e-mark being made to end in a loopas in. the case of the long I (Jine, 1. 3;-vare , 1. 15 ;and geyyuttire (wronglyfor geyyuttire\1, 26) ; whereas, in others, it is not distinguished from tide short e (compare e.g. /c<fa 1. 46 with Sena?, I, 47). The fli-symbol occurs onlyonce in 1. 72 in the word naaratiya, (a mistake for nairrtiya')* Here, the stroke slanting to the right over the talekattu of the letter may be compared with the corresponding stroke (but slantingto the left) of the secondaryai in old Nagari inscriptions. ^Ihe compound vowel-mark o, -which consists of a, and e, is simplehi its formation, and consists of two inverted hooks placed one at each end of the top-stroke the one to the right representing a and that to the left e. *the anusv&ra is marked bya small circle or, more frequently, by a dot and is always placedat the right top-cornerof the letter to which it belongs. The uipadhmSniyain 11. . 106 and 107 is represented bythe symbolfor r ($&) j while, the jihvamutiya,, which may be expectedat the end of 1. 99, does not occur there. 
"With regard to consonants, it may be stated that all the five test letters discussed by Dr. Fleet in his study of ancient Kanarese records,2 are representedin the subjoined inscriptions vis. Wi, , j, I and 1. Kh in Ichanda- (1. 42) and in duhkha^ (1, 99 f .) is of the later cursive form. N occurs as the first member of the conjunct consonant nga,at the beginningof 1. 61 and is of the closed type, J appearsten times and in only one instance (j of jna in 1. 1)is of the square type exactly similar to that which occurs in the Mantrawadi inscription of AmOghavarsha I. In tbe other nine instances,it is of the same type but closed.

From the foregoing it is evident that the subjoined records belongto the Nojambas who claimed descent from the Pallivas, The territory over which the Nolatnbas originally held sway has been suggested to be tho small district of Nojambalge, mentioned in two Rashtrakftta records3 of about the 9th century A,D,, which, later on, appearsto have received the appellation of Sfolambavadi thirty-two thousand. This province, which mnst have been originally confined to the districts of Taoikur and Chitaldroogin the Mysore State, and part at least of the Ananta pnr District in the Madras Praidency,v?as gradually extended as the Nolamhas rose into power, and in the 10th centnry A.D. included tho major portionof the Bellary, Bangalore and Kolar districts. Portions of Salem and "North Miot must also have been in the possessionof the Noiambas at the time of the subjoinedrecord.3 
In his volumes on Chitaldroog and Tumkur (Vols. XI and XII of the EpigrapUa,Garna iica) Mr, Bice has collected a large number of NojLamba records which give na a fair outline of the history of that dynasty. T-wo pillar inscriptions from Hemavati in the IJadaksira taluka of the Anantapur District and two from the town of Madaksira itself, have been included by 
1Sawayins are literally the members of a congregationor religion. Here, perhaps,the reference is to the four main divisions of the Jainas who, like the Hindus, recognise the foui1ewtes, w'z. the Biahmanas, Kshatriyas, VaiSyae and ^fidras, The significance of the next three terms nadu, nakara and nuraiaaa-na, is not clear, The first moans' country'or' country-folk' ; the second,f town' or 'town-folk' and the third perhaps signifies' rulers of men' or' officers o goverament.' What the author wants to say may be that the witnesses to the transaction Tfere the whole Jaina community consistingof 'country-folk,1 'town-folk' and "officers/ Mr. Vcckayya suggests that the three terms in question, with the refleiive pronoun ware which follows them, may be meant to serve as a clause explaining what lias been stated before. In other words, it may mean that the smayinswho were witnesses to the present graut, are to be considered in themselves as good as the nddu, the nakara and the namSataw who, perhaps in ordinary cases, lore witness to publictransactions.

8 Dr. Plot's Kanare&s Dynasties, p. 318. That Nolambavadi included a part,if not the whole, of the Anaatapur District is proved by the fact that Hefijeju,i.e. the modern Hemavati, the capital of the Nolambas, is situated in the Madaksira taluka of that district, Aa regards the iu&uanee which the Nolambas exercised about the end of the 9th century A.D, in the northern portionof the Salem District, we have the evidence of the subjoined records at Dharmapuri, About this period, North Arcottoo must have been subjectto Nnlainha influence \ for, the Ambur inscriptions of the time of Nripatnngavikramavwmaurefer to a cattle raid organised by the Nolamha againrt Arnaiyur (above, Vol. IT. p. 180).

No. 14] TWO NOLAMBA INSCRIPTIONS FROM DHARMAFDRI. 59   
Jagattunga-Prabhutavarsha-Govinda III. whose datea range from A.D. 794 to 8131 and was, as a feudatory of that sovereign, rulingthe Nolambalge one thousand aud Nirgunda three hundred districts. Coming to Nolambadhirajaor Polalchora-Nomba of the Hemavati inscription, 
we gather from the subjoinedrecord that he married Jaabbe, tbe daughter of the Western Ganga king Rachamalla-Vermmadl This ideutical relationship is mentioned in two other records of Mahendra-one fromEemavatiiuthe Auantapur District and the other from Baiagur in the Sira taluka of the Tumkur District.3 These two inscriptions tell us that Jaabbe was the daughter o Rachamalla and the youngersister of Nrfcimarga-PermSdi. Accordingto Dr. Fleet, Rachamalla, the father-in-law of Nolambadhiraja, is identical with Satyavakya-Bajamalla (A.D. 840 and 870-71) . s As the earliest record hitherto discovered of M'ahendradhiraja-Nolamba is dated in Saka 800, we may tentativelyfix the lower limit of Nolambadhiraja'B reign at A.D. 878- 79. And as the father of Nolambadhiraja, viz. Pallavadhiraja, was a feudatory of the Raahtrakuta king Goviuda III. (A.D. 794 to 813), the upper limit would be 813 A.D. Thus, Nolambadhirajathe second king mentioned in the subjoined recordmay be presumed to have ruled between A.D. 813 and A.D. 878-79, though the period covered by this interval is an unusually long one. 
1 We arrive at the same result if we go back two generations from the earliest available date of Mahendradhiraja, vis. A.D. 878-79 (Si. 88), and shall be near to the close of Govinda's leign. SfcUl another synchro nisrn from a Chitaldroog record may helpus to settle the probable period of Charuponnera. Charuponnera18 father Simhapota is therein mentioned (ibid. Cl, 8,) as tbe subordinate of a certain Perjuanadi, who, tia the name suggests, was evidently a Western Ganga king. According to Mr. Rice, Permanafli was a title which the early Western 
Ganga king Srlpurusha-Muttarasa"took away from the king of Kanchl"(Mysore G-aselteer, Vol. I. p. 814 and Up, Caen, Vol. VIII. Nr, 35). Dr. Fleet assigns this Sripurusha to the period .A.D. 765 to 805 ( Up. I.uL Vol. VI. p. 64). Consequently, the time of Charuponnera, son of Simbapota, must have been subsequent to A,D. 805 at was already found to be the case. 
2Sp. Cam. Vol. XII. Si. Nos. 24 and 38. Both of these inscriptions have been translated by Mr. Rice on pp. 91 and 94 of his Tumkur volume. Here, he connects Jdyabbey^embot mahddevi of both the records, with Nolamlddhirdjardtangg which precedes a long parenthetical clause giving the parentage of Jayabbe. By separating the expression Nolambadhirajaratange into NoUmbadhirdjwa and tange, he arrives at the conclusion that the sister (tahgt) of Nolambadhiraja was married to the Ganga king Eachamalla. Jaabba (or Jayabbe), we know, was the queen of Nojambadhiraja and mother of Maheudra. If, accordingly, the phrase Jdyabley-emlol mabddevi is to be correctly connected with the word Nolamlidolhirdja,the latter must, accordingto strict gram*- matical rules, end in the dative. But this would not be the case if we divide, as Mr. Rice does, the phvasa NolamlddhirdjardtaAge into Nolambddhirdjara and tahge.I think it is mora nntural to divide it into Nolambddhirdjar and dtanffe. That this is actually intended is apparent from what we find in the subjoined record which states that Mahendradhiraja was bom to Nolambadhiraja ( Solimbddhirdjarffffam) and to Jaabbe (Jdabbegam). Mr. Rice's wrong interpretation, of this phraseis evidentlyalso responsiblefor the statement in the Mytore Gazetteer, Vol. I, p. 807, that"PallavadMraja's daughter was married to the Ganga king Rajamalla." An inscription at Chikka-Madhure in the ChaUakere taluka { Ep. Cam. Vol. XI. Cl. 88), however, seems to prove that the Ganges and the Kolambas were related by intermarriage alreadyin the reign of Simhapota. It is here stated that Permanadi (Le. the Western Ganga king Sripurusha-Muttarasa) married the daughter's daughter of Simhapota. 
3 Above, Vol. VI. p. 66. Mr. Rica suggeststhat the Nolambadhiraja mentioned in an undated Ganga record o Nlthnar'ga nt Kendatti-Madivala (Ep.Corn. Vol. X. KL 79) aud the Nolamba king of the same name mentioned in the Pallava record at Bhoga-Nandi (Md. Cl. 26), also undated, may both be identical with Nolambadhiraja Polalehora (ibid. Introduction, pp.xviiS and xix) father of Mahendradhiraja and brother-in-law of Nitimarga. This suggestion does not appear to he correct j for, Nitirnarga-Peraanadigal under whom the former Nolambadhiraja is stated to have been ruling the district Gangarusasira is, I believe, identical with Nitimarga Permanadi Banavikrama whom Dr. Fleet places between A.D. 810 and 840 aud not with Nitimarga3 the unidentified son of Satyavakya Eachamalla. NoJambadhiTSja of tlje Nandi record does not appear to have been a feudatory chief hut an indepeudeut Nojamba sovereign who 'WRS ruling the earth' fyfithm-rajyam gey} without; any overlord. Very probably he is identical with Immadi or Irmadi-Nolambadhiraja whose record of Saka 899 is found at Kandavara not very far from Nandi (Bombay 6-axetteer, Vol. I. Part II. p. 332 and Ep, Corn. Vol. X. Cl. 45). Nttimarga, the brother-in-law of Nolarabadhiraja-PoJalchora, did not, probably, succeed to the Ganga throne ; for, we know from the Huskucu inscription that Satyavakya Rajamallft'n chosen successor (yuvaraja,) was Butanwa (ahove, Voi, VI. p. 66).

is Mt a mere boast ; for, the veryexistence of the subjoinedrecords (A.) and (B.) almost on the borders of, if not actually within, the Sana country, proves beyonddoubt the occupationot that part of the country by the tfokmbas. From an inscription at Budidepalle" u the F

Zanundfei which, on pateographical grounds may be referred to about the 9th century=

as 
a subordinate of the Ganga-Pallava king Nripatnnga,his date would fall into the last quarterot the 9th century A.D.8 And, as Mahendradliiraja's conquestof the Banas is to be referred to abort the same "period, the raid onPuli-nadu recorded in the Budidepalle inscription may bo supposed to have occurred r* the early partof the reignof Mahendradhiraja and wo'uld,in that case, be bat the commencement of He campaign against the Banas, which eventually earned for him the title' destroyer of the Mahabali-race.' 
Pallava. soverei^ntT ca^ejojjrend abonUhe middle of the Sth century A.D. and in the subsequent straggle for powerand supremacy among the various tribes that owed allogiannr. to the Pallavaa, the Nolambas were often ranged against the Banas. The incidents recorded in the Bangavadi jgrnwiZ,7 f r instance, show that duringthe reignof the Q-anga-Pallava kmg Viaaya-Naraainihavikraniavarman, Skanda-Banadhiraja met in battle Dadiya (DadigaJ, Banaraja and Mahendravikrama. Duringthe reignof the Vaidumba-Mafcaraja Oanda Trinetra, Banarasa and Vaidamba-maharaja marched on Soremati and were met on^he battlefield by the Nolamba, Eacbamalla and Dadiga.8 An inscriptionat Pedda-Tippasamudram in Ihu Cuddapah District states that the Vaidumba king Ganda-Trinetra fought wiph tNolombi (.*. the Nolamba king) on the battlefield just referred to.9 The. mragalat Chedalja near Pnnganur10belongs to the reignof Mahavali-Banarasa and states that the king on behalf of tlto

Permanadi led an offensive campaign against the Holamba, Bachamalla and Mayindadi and met them in battle at Soremati. We have aheadyreferred to the raid into Pnli-nadu by 'the No)amba during the reign of Bfinavidyadhara.In the reign of the Sana Mug Vijayadityan Virachulamani Prabtmrnerti,1 a certain BLaduvatti Muttarasan, perhapsconnected with, the Nolambas, attacked Koyatur, the modern Laddigan^jnear^ Punganur2 in the Sana territory. ThuSj in these early conflicts we always see the NoJambaB opposedto the Banas and it is not unlikely that herein we have to seek for the cause which led to the destruction, or complete conquest of the Barias by the Nolamba king Mahendradhiraja-Nolamba which is claimed foe him in the Dharrnapuvi inscription A. It will also be easy, now, to Bee how ISfoJamba, records came .to exist in such large numbers in the Bangalore and Kolar districts of the Mysore 'State which apparently belonged paitlyto Gangavadi 96,0003 and partlyalso to Perumbanappadi4 the territory of the Banas. Mahendra before he entered into hostilities with the Gangas and the Banas appears to have been a subordinate of the former ruling the Gangarusasira.5 What led to his hostilities with the Gangas it is not possible to sayat present.6 The fact that Raoheya Ganga, as stated in the Iggali inscription, died in battle against the Folamba (i.e. Mahendra dhiraja) about A.D. 891927 and that Ejeyappa (A.D. 908 to 938)"governedthe Gangavadi province as a united whole after deprivingall his enemies of their power"8 shows clearly that MahSndradhiraja, at least during his lifetime, held under subjection a pretty large portion, of the Gangavadi province. This perhaps accounts also for the existence of an intrusive record of his time at Taynlur in the Mandya taluka of the MysoreDistrict9(the veryheart of the Ganga country) which gives for Mahendra the date Saka 817 the latest known for him so fai1. It will be enough to state before closingthis paragraph,that ihe Nolambas started a petty state in and around Hemuvati in the Tumkur District about the beginningof the 8th century A.D. and continuing to hold it as the subordinates of the Raahtrakutas and the Ganga^ they fell into frequent conflicts with, the Banas, the Vaidumbas and the Chslas and even with their overlords the Gangas. About the end of the 9th century A.D. they found a favourable oppor tunity and rose to eminence under Mahendradhiraja-]S"oj[amba. 
A. new name in the succession list of the Nolambaa which,as will be shown be] ow, has to be placed between Mahendra and his son Ayyapa,has apparentlybeen* missed by Mr. Rice in his treatment of the chronologyof that family. From an. inscriptionat Avani iu tie Mulbagal taluka of the Kolar District,10 it appearsas if Mahendra had a brother called Iriva-Nolamba who was born of a different mother. The inscriptionstates that Divabbarasi or Divajamba, born of the Kadamba family, was the chief queen (agra-mahisU)of Polalehora, who, as stated

In. the Bangalore District a good portion of the agricultural populationof the Wofekaligasect "belongto a subdivision called Qangadikara.

above, is identical Trith NolambSdhiraja, father of Mahendra. Prom the wayin which Iriva Nolamha is introduced in the inscription,it looks as. if lie -was born of Dlvalamba after Mahen dra's succession to the throne, or,if bom earlier, his claims to succession had been overlooked in preference to those of Mahendra, who had perhaps stronger support than Ijciva- Ncjaraba. Still it is not possible to assert that, affcer Mahendra, the succession passed011 direct to his Bon Ayyapa. The only sure date for Ayyapa hitlierto knovn is Saka 841.1 Between this and Saka 817, the latest known date for Mahendra, there is an interval of nearly one generation, Mr, Rice refera to two inscriptions of the time of Nolambadhiraja-Nolipayya, from the Mad dagiri taluka of the TumknT District,3 one of which supplies the date Saka 820, Painga[a. This iSTolambadhiraja-Kolipayyais believed byMr. Bice to be the same as Ayyapa. But we knovr that the latter*s distinctive surname was Nanmiga and not Nolipayya.It is not impos bible, therefore; that Ir^va-ISToiamba, the son of Dlvalamba and step-brotherof Mahendra succeeded the latter under the name NoLimbadhiraja-NoHpayya.8 If this conjectureis proved by future researches to be correct, it follows that Ijfiva-Nolanaba mentioned in the Avani record was the son of DivaJambS and not her grandson (Dilipayya Ir.iva-KoJamba) as Mr, Rice putsit.4 Unfortunately the record 13 not dated. Otherwise, it would have given us the date of Maheudra's death and that of the succession of Nolipayya; for, it states that Diva] amba on the death of Mahendra built a temple and called it Nolamba-Narayanesvara after NoJamba-Narayana,one of Mahendra's birudas. She also grantedthe village of Avinas'i (Avani) and called it Pojalchora mangaja, perhaps after the name of her husband and in it constructed the tank Divalabba samudra after her own name. 
Ayyapadeva, son of Mahendra, must have succeeded Nolipayya, Of him we learn from inscription (B.) that he had the Urudu, "the asylum of truth (nanni)," Ifc is this liruda evi dently that accounts for his other name N'anniga or Nanniga, which occurs in his inscriptions, He was the contemporary of the Ganga king Ereyappa and about A.D. 938 fought with the latter's help the battle of Tumbepadi against Viramahendra whom Dr. Eleet has identified with the Eastern Chalukya king OhaJukya-Bhima II.6 The onlydate available for Ayyapa from inscriptions publishedhitherto has been Saka 841, ts"vara:=A.D. 918-19. Although Ayyapa must, in the early partof his reign have been at war with the Q-angas,6 while the latter were attempting to regain what they had ceded to Ayyapa's father Mahendradhiraja, he, later on, became their friend as appears from his war against the common foe,7 the Eastern Chalukya king Chalukya-Bhima II.

If this refers to Dilipayya, the grandson of Mahendra, as Mr, Rice ta&es it, it appears to have been appliedto him iu accordance with the custom by which grandchildren are often named after their grandfathers ; we may thaa have to presume that Dilipayya's surname 
was not that of bis direct grandfather Maheadra hat that of the latter's brother Ifiva-Nolamho. Nolipayya (L). * Ibid. Introduction, p. xix.

are to be taken as literally true,1Ayyaparoust have fallen in the fight with Chalukya-Bhima II, Br, Pleet places tkis event about the end of Ejeyappa's reign,i.e. between A.D. 934 and 938. Accordingly, we may perhapsinfer that Ayyapa ruled from Saka 841 (=A.D, 918-19) to Saka 860 (=A.D. 938-39). But his recordsregistered by Mr. Rice in the volumes of the Sjwjjropkta Carnatica, do not assignto him dates later than AD. 920. After Ayyapa2 the family appears to have gradually declined till it was subjugated byike Choja king BajarajaI. o Taujore in A.D, 998-99.8 
The Nojamba occupation of Tagaduru which, is established bythe existence in it of the records of Mahendra and his son Ayyapais corroborated by another inscription4on a broken pillar discovered in the Mariyamman templeat old Dharmapuri, It registers the grantof a tank (?) called Marudaneri by Mahendra-IToiamba in Saka 800 (correspondingto the cyclic year Vilambi) to the teacher Eonnera-goravar who,as the suffix goravar indicates, must have been a Saiva. 5 It is also recorded iu this inscription that the tank after repair was placed by the teacher ia the hands of the smayinsP On this occasion, the merchants (evidently those of Tagadiiru) , among whom figure Chandiyanna and W[i]dMyacina, the builders of the 7aina lasadi recorded in inscription A., [assigned ] tolls on certain commodities as a demdUn^ The inscription being broken, it is not possibleto sayto what particular templethe devadaw was 
intended, The record at any rate supplies us with two important facts, w (1) that already,in Saka 800 (the earliest date for Mahgudra, known also from the Baragururecord ) Mahendra had occupied Dharmapuri and the surrounding country, and (2) that the Saiva and the Jaina faiths (samaya) were flourishing side byside at Tagadiiru under the patronageof the Nolamha kings towards the close of the 9th century A.D. Still another fragmentary inscription on a pillar of black granite iu the Mallikarju.ua templeab old Dharmapuri7begins with the phrase svasti Pallm-anvay^a and introduces NolambSdhira"ja and the Ganga king [BachamaUa] in the very same terms as inscription A. The record does not appearto have contained any Saka date but the month, fortnight, titU, week-day,etc, are given on one of the mutilated 
1Above, Vol. VII, p. 187, text line 38. 
! la tie Deoli plates of the Easbtrakiita king Krishna III., dated in Sab -862, a Pallava king named Anniga ia said to have been defeated by Krishna III. (AbovejVol. IV, p, 191),II fa not unlikely that this Anniga was the son of Ayynpa. 
s Tho earliest Chola inscription mentioned in the EpigrapkiaCarnatita, (Vol. X. Introduction, p. txiv)is one of Madiregonda Ko-Parakesarivarman. Mr. Bice himself doubts if this could be attributed to the early Choja king Parantaka I. The next sure record is one of KajarajaI. from the Hoaiofe tahka (Up, Cam. Vol. IX. Hi 111). Kaj&raja's conquest of Gangapadi, Mambapadi and Tadiyapadiare mentioned for the first tioe in his records of the 14th year. Consequently, we have to supposethat Eftjar&ja overran those provincesia A.D. 998-99, but perhaps allowed the rulers to continue governingtheir kingdomsas Chola feudatories. For, Hi 111 slates that in Saka 920 the very year in which Rajaraja must have entered Mysore Qannarasft, son of Ayyapa- (leva (apparently a Nolamba) was ruling a portionof Daligavadias a feudatoryof the Chola king. In (Saka 923) the 16th yearof Eajaraja, a certain flojaraljadhiraja made a grantin his capucityaa the generalof the Chola emperor (JSp, Cam. Vol. X, Mb. 208). , Mambadhiraja Chorayya,with Nolamba attributes, was rulingin Saka 983 also as a tributary of the Chola king Mummadi-Cliola (Rajaraja I.) (ibid. Ci 118). In the 25th year of Rajarfijal. (i.e.A.D. 1009) Tagadur-nadu was ruled bya Chola subordinate named Paficbavan Brahmadhiraya? (Madras Epigrapnical collection for 1909, No. 254) and was included in the Mujvayi-rajyain the reignof the Vijayanagara king Devaraya I. (t&t'i No. 2&1).It maybe pointed out that KL 75, which Mr. Bice supposes to be one of Rajaraja I, dated in bii 7th year (Hid. Introduction, p. xxiv),is a record of Bajaraja II, j for the intro ductory phrase j>u manviga polil-eh occurs in some of the Tamil records of the latter.

No. 14.] TWO NOLAMBA INSCRIPTIONS FROM DHARMAPURI. 65   
On the date of inscription A., Professor JUcobi of Bonn, to whom I had submitted the details for verification, has very kindlycontributed the following:"The date won't come out right. The Paridhavi year was 892. On the 1st June of that year Jupiter entered Dhanns. Ashudha su, di. 5 fell on 3rd June, Saturday,not Thursday, and the naksh&tra was Magha,not Purva-Pbalguni." Inscription B. is not dated, but may be referred to the beginningof the 10th century A. D.

2 Kurulci is not given in Dr. Kittel's KannacLa-'Englis'h Dictionary. The word Jcwrike means 'a small village.1 In the description of boundaries it* is very unlikelythat an unspecified village would be mentioned. Accordingly, I teke JcujruJci as tentatively equivalentto guruchi or guzige,the former of which is the name of a tree and the latter that of & plant. 
3 Alvu is the same as aliw or abipv which meana 'ruin, waste.' It also means 'the burning (of forest fire) beyond the limit.' Perhaps jpar-aZuuis to be explainedaa 'big waste/ though its exact significance is not clear to roe.

different forms. Note also nu m -nudityntasya, line 2. The form of the initial i in ity=evam, line 8, is the same as in the Kahaum pillar inscription.1 With regardto orthography I may note the doubling of a consonant before r in -gottra-,lines 5 and 10 (but pwfro,line 5, putrah, line 6) and after r in ^pftrvudyam and -acharyy-,line 4, and yatha-karttavya-dMrmwilca-karmmana, line 9;the change of an anuBvara to n "before A in =syiin=diva8a-pvrwayajh,line 4; the use of 
clichh in the beginning of a word in Ohc,hliando(jy=, line 4 ; and the use of s at the end of a word before s in kuvKiramatya^Sikliara-,line 6. 
The- inscription refers itself to the reignof the ancient Gupta king Eumaragupta I., and is dated in [Gupta-] Samvat 117, on the tenth day of Karttika, corresponding to A.B. 436. It is therefore of almost the same date as the completionof the templeof the Sun when.Kumara gupta's subordinate Bandhuvarm.an was governingat Dasapura.2 
It registers a gift made by PyitMvishena, the son of Chandragnpta's kumaramatya SiTcharasvamin, ^ho was the son of Vishnupalitabhatta, the son of Kuramaravyabhatta, of the ChhandOgas, whose gotras-weiQ [Ava] and Vajin, The former gotrais new to me. The Vajins also occur elsewhere. Prithivishena is described as the mantrin of Kumaragnpta, as his Itumdrumatya, and subsequentlyas his niahabaladhiknta. The gift was made for the worship of the Mahadeva known as Prithivisvara, i.e. probablythe lingo, ou which our inscription has been incised, with proper righteous offerings, The portion containing the names of the donees has unfortunately, been lost, and what is lost cannot be restored with absolute certainty. So far as I can see, the donees must ha-ve been certain Brahmanas from Ayodhya, who were Irving in the vicinity of Mahadeva Sailesvara, who belongedto various gotras and charanas, and were proficient in observances, in sacred study,in the mantras, the s&tras, Wteshyas and pravachanas, and who had something to do at the devadrew. *.e. image processionat Bharadi . . This interpretation is 3 however, far from beingcertain. The restoration of the words denotingthe various branches of learningin which the donees are said to have been fully versed, is, I think, certain. The geographical name Bharadi is a mere conjecture. What remains of the letters seems to favour it, The name of the place where the linga was found is said to be Bharadhi Pih, but it is not possibleto identifythis form with Bharadi. I would compare the word Bharatiya found in one of the inscriptions on the Sanchi stapa3 where Professor Biihler reads : [bhajradiyasa sapurisasa yugapajrikasa danam. I would translate "the gift of the holy man Yugapajaka, from Bharadi," I arn unable to restore the four akstiaras followingafter Bharadi. They look like d. s, m. d. 8. m. d. perhapsstands for samudrtf, which is an epithet of Siva, The word devadrom is known from lexicographers* and said to mean "idol

BY PfiorasoB SrEN KONOW, PH.D.; CHBISTIAKIA. 
These plates were originally brought to light bythe late Mr. A. M, T. Jackson, who pub lished them in the Journal ofthe Bombay Asiatic Society.1 ifr. Jackson's edition was not accompanied by a facsimile of the original, and it was not, therefore, possible to judge about the palaaograpbic character of the grant.I now re-edit it from impressions which I owe to the kindness of Mr, Henry Cousens. 
The plates are two in number, and they were, accordingto Mr. Jaokson, found in November 1898,<l buried about two feet below the surface of a cart track in the village of Sunev Kulla in the Hansot Mabal of the Broach Dietrict , . . The first plateis entire. The second has suffered damage (1) by the wianohing off of the seal, which has destroyed a few aksharas in the first line, and (2) by the breakingoff of a piece of the left-hand edge, which has destroyed one akihara in line 4, two in line 5, two in line 6, and one in line V k , . The lower edgeof the firat plate was formerlyattached to the upper edge of the second by two copper rings, one of which remains attached to each of the plates. The seal, whioh was probably carried bythe left-hand ring, has been wrenched off and is lost. The letters are deeplyout and in inany places stow through on the back of the plates," 
The two plates are of the same size, measuring 12|"x6|". The first contains 12, and iOha second 13 lines of well executed writing. The average size of the individual letters is' y.The characters belong to the southern class and are closely connected with the form

It is dated in numerical symbols on the 15th, day of the bright half of of the year 292. 
.As pointed out by Mr. Jackson, the date must be referred to the Kalacturi era, and it ^^d accordingly fall in either A.D. 540 or A.D. 541.3 The donor, the Maharaja ..arnagimha, is not elsewhere known, but I think Mr. Jackson is quite right in 
l3 -ruing that he was a feudatory (mahnksumantn) of the Kalachuris. He infers this from the ofc thnt SOnavva, the village granted, is said to be situated in the Antarnarmada-w/iaya,i.e. oOl-ding to him,"the district within (i.e. on this side of) the Narbada." This, he says,"shows afi it belonged to a kingdom whose seat also lay south of the Narbada though it included also irri t ry*^e nort Q of that river." I do not quitesee how he arrives at this cou elusion. The a,TLslation of Antarnarmada-visbayaas "the district within the Narmada"would be possible, L -fc antar does not mean"on this side," but"between/' The word has been explainedaa a Tzv&vrihi by by. Fleet,8 meaning the country on both sides of the lower partof the Narmada. 3 ancot therefore accept Mr. Jackson's explanationof the word antarnarmadfi-vishaya, but I 
concur in his' opinion that"ori the whole the most probable supposition appearsto be that amasiriiha was a feudatory of the Kalaohuris, whose era he used, and who were cer Inly recognised as supreme in the lower Narbada valley about A.D. 580 when Nirihullaka made 8 grant."4 The wording of our grant sometimes recalls the phraseologyof the Sarsavni plates ;5 napare 11. 18-19 with 11. 26-27 of the latter, and, especially, the end of the iwo grants, where 3 have, in both cases, first an instrumental (-prapitajnaya and -vijnapanaya, respectively), a bahuvrihi ending in -dtitakam and followed by Ukhikam, and finally the date expressed same way in numerical figa'res.

[Kalachnri] Samvat 361, correspondingto A.D. 609 or A.D. 610, and he was, accordingto tK ^erar plates1 and the Badami pillar inscription,3 defeated bythe Western Chalukya Mangalesa. This seems to havo been the first really important event in the historyof tho Western Chalukyas Buddharaja's defeat by Mangaleaa must have taken place before the 25th October A.D. uOl, i i that be the date of the Badami pillar inscription3 But even after that date ho retained command of the country about Broach, for his Sarsavnl plates, -which are dated in A.D. 609 or 61 (see above), register the granto a village in that district. The Traikutakas are known to have held sway in Southern Gnjaratin the last half of the fifth century,for Dahrasena's PUI'LK plates are dated in [Kalachuri] Samvat 207,* and a copperplateof hia sou Vyaghrasena from the Sarafc District is dated in [Elalachnri] Samvat 231.6 The present grant belongsto the interval between Yyaghrasena (Sarhvat 231) and Bnddharaja (Sarhvat 361). Buddharaja must, according to the Badami pillar inscription, have began to reign before A,D. 601. We do not know how long his father Samkaragana, the overlord of the Maliaptlupati Nirihullaka of the Sankheda plate/ reigned, and we do not know anythingof Samkaragana's father Krishnaraja, but he, or his predecessor, must have been the overlord of Samgamasimha. Our inscription, therefore, throws some light on the historyof the Broach District in the first half of the sixth century. 
Of the geographical names mentioned in onr grant, Bharukaehchha, the residence o ifa McLKasnmanta,, the Maharaja Sarhgarnasimha,is the present Broach, Sonawa, the village granted, must be identified with either Sunao Eala, situated in 21 28|71ST. and 72 547E.t01 Snnao Khurad, in 21 29' JS. and 72 53J' E.

SAMVAT 1051. 
BY PROFESSOR STEN Koiro?', PH.D.; CHBISTIANU. 
These plates have already been noticed by Mr, H. H. Dhruva3 and MunsM Debiprasad.' They are in. the possessionof the Brahmana Devaram of Balera, in the SanchCr Diatrid, Jodhpnr State. I edit them from impressions supplied by Mr. D. R. Bhandarkar. 
There are two plates measuring 7|"x 5", and each of them is inscribed on one side only. There are altogether 21 lines of writing, 10 on the first and 11 on the second plate, and the plates are in an excellent state of preservation. They vere held together bya ring, which Iwd been broken when the plates came into Mi. Bhandarkar'a hands. There was no seal. 
The character is northern Nagari of the lOfch c^ntnry. The virama is nsed in samvat, J. 1; purvvavatt 1. 2; vaset, 1. 19, and -fpurushan,1. 4. There are very few orthographical peculiari ties. V Is used for 6 throughout, an,ds is written instead of s in sasanaw, 1. 19. A consonant is doubled after r in -vwirggat-t1. 10; avarggetl.lB't ^abhyarchchya,1. 7; -dharmma-, 1.13; purvvavat,1. 2, etc. On the other Land, no doubling takes place in -Durlalhadwrya-,I. 11. 
The language is Sanskrit, and, with the exceptionof an imprecatoryiloka in 1L 18-19, here ascribed to Vyasa, the whole of the inscriptionis inprose, 
The inscription is one of the Mahafajadliiraja Mularaja I., the founder of fcihe A^hilvEd branch of the Chaulukyas. Two otherinscriptionsof Mularajaare known; The oldest, which is dated in Yikranm-Samvat 1030, on the 5th dayof the brighthalf of BhSdrapada, corresponding to Monday, tho 24th AugustA.D. 974, has been noticed byMr. Dliruva.* Tie other ia the* Kadi plate of Yikrama-Samvat 1043, the 15th dayof the dark fortnightof MSgl&>on a Sunday corresponding to the 2nd January9S7.6 Our inscriptionis the latest one of BCUlarSja, and it i' dated Samvat 1051, on the 15th day of the bright fortnight of Magha, at a lunar eolipeo

(1. 61, corresponding to Saturday, the 19th January 995, wlien there was a lunar eclipse, visible In India. None of these inscriptions teaches us much about Mulavaja. According to the Kadi plates, he belonged to the Chaulnkikas, was the sen of the JMafairajiidhiraja Raji, and had, hy hie own arm, conquered the Sarasvata-mandala. The Gujaratchronicles state that Raji was king of Kalyanakataka in Kanauj, and add some tales about him, -which have not, however, been corroborated hy inscriptions. TLe information which can be gathered about Mularaja from other inscriptions of his family,is also meagre. Be is called"the sun wlio bringsthe lotus-pond of the Chaulukya familyinto blossom" (Kadi plates of Jayantasimha, Bhimadeva, and Tribhuvanapala1). Only conventional praiseJa bestowed on him in the Vadnagar prasasti? where we read, 
(V. 4.) Illustrious Mftlaraja, who stepped on the diadems of princes, was a priceless pearl to enhance the splendourof the farce of his family, he who "became the root of the tree of justice that had been but nt by the forest-fire of the Kali (age") and gained the afEection of his subjects by exceedingly light taxes (aa the moon pleases by exceedingly cold rays). 
(V, 5.) He made the Fortuna of the kingdomof the Chapotkata princes, whom he tool* captive at his will, an objectof enjoymentfor the multitude of the learned, of Ks relatives, of Brahmans, bards and servants. Won by his valour that mightily blazed forth in battle, the guardian goddesses of the kingsof all the other regions then clave for a longtime to the Fortuna residing in. his sword. 
The Gujarat chroniclers know more about Mtlaraja's dealings with the ChapStkatas. The late Professor B ihler has, however, shown8 that not much credit can be givento them, and it is safer to abstain from using them. 
Mftlaraja's charities are also alluded to in. the Devapattana inscription,4 where we are introduced to the astrologer Uyabhat^a, whose three sons Madhava, LUla and BhaTbha the king charged with the supervisionof these charities. 
The chroniclers state that Mularaja. reigned from Vikrama-Samvat 998-1053, and they tell us about his expeditions againstother kings,i Shortlyafter his accession, they inform ns, he waa attacked by the &aja of Sakainbharl and Barapa, the generaloti Tailapa, or, according to the Suhritaaumkirtama, of the king of Kanauj. The' Sakambtari king must have been the Chahamaaa Vigraharaja,5 whose Haraha inscription6 is dated in Vikrama-Samvat 1030. 
Barapa is described as a Chalukya7 or a Chaulukya,8 who is said to be descended from the mythical Chaulukya and a Bashtrakuta princess. Dr. Fleet9 doubts that Barapa was the general of Tailapa, because he was a Chaulukya and not a Ghalukyalike the latter.10 What ever his origin was} he certainly succeeded in establishing himself in Lata, where we find his grandson Kirtiraja as mahaman$alevara in Saka 940, and Kirtiraja's grandson Triloohanapala in Saka 972. According to the chronicles, Barapadrove Mularaja back to Kanth.ad.urga (the modern Kanthkot in the eastern division of Kaohh), but was later 911 defeated by him. 
That Hularaja was also at war with the Kalactraris has been inferred from the Deoli11 and Karhad18plates of the Rashtrakuta Krishna IH, dated Saka 862 and 880 respectively, where we are told that"on hearingof the conquestof all the strongholds in, the southern

, simply by means of his (Krishna's) angry glance, the hope about Kalanjara and CMtrakuta vanished from the heart of the Grurjara."

I have already mentioned that, accordingto the chroniclers, Mularaja reigned till Vifcranw* ttwuvat 1053. This agreeswell with the fact that he is mentioned as a contemporary in the Ujjapar inscription of the Bashtrakuta Dhavala of Hastikundj,2 'which is dated in that year,

No. 19.-PIMPARI PLATES OF BHARAVARSHA-DHRUVARAJA; 
SAKA-SAMVAT 697. 
BY K. B. PATSIK, BA.; POONA. 
This grant consists of three plates, each measuring IQf'x 7JV. The ring on which the seal was strung had been detached from the plates when they came into my possession, The weight of the three plates is 260 tolas, while that of the ring and the seal is 190 tolas. The diameter of the ring is 2^" and the lengthof the seal is 6". On the topof the seal there is, in relief, on a countersunk surface, a figureof the four-armed god Vishnu. The grant belongs to Daaharath Patil and Lala Patil of Pimpari in East Khandesh and was published by Mr, Gr. K. Chandorkar in a Marathi magazine named Prallwta nearly two years ago. I obtained the original plates on loan for taking an impression of them throughthe kind offices of Mr. GK K. Chandorkar. The plate accompanying this paperhas been prepared from impressions received from. Mr. Narayanrao Tatake of the ArchseologicalOffice in Poona. 
The grant is written in the Magarl characters of the periodto which the inscription refers itself. The peculiarities in respectof orthography, which deserve to be noted, are that r is always used in place of ^, as in f^for f^g in line 62, and that conjunct consonants imme' diately following *; are sometimes doubled as in ^frrilf^ in line 6, but not in Wft in line 18 and in ffi$JqHl'q in line 31. The grantis written in the Sanskrit language, and, exceptin the donative passages and the last sentence, the whole is in Yerse. It may be remarked that all the verses of our inscription are met with in later Rashtrakuta grants. 
The inscription records the grant, by Dharavarsha m-Dhruvarajadeva, of thevillage called Lilagrama to a Brahmana named Bhattadeva, \vhen six hundred and ninety-seven years of the Sakaking had passed away, on the new moon-day, in the dark half of the month of Karttika, when there was a solar eclipse. The mention of the solareclipse in the date may be taken as a proof of the genuinenessof the present grant. But it comes into conflict with the Dhulia grant of Karkaraja, dated Saka-Samvat 701, which purportsto have been issned in the prosperous reignof Govindaraja II.1 I begto . invite attention to tho following passage in tbat grant :~ 
[l*] 
Above, Vol. VIII. p. 182. 
K
82 EPIGBAPHIA INDIOA. [VoL,X,   
Here the expression 'CKITWI can only mean"by the command of Bhruvaraja," How could Karkaraja order all feudatories by the command of Dhravaraja,in the prosperous reiga of G-oviiida'II., when Dhruva was not the reigning sovereign? The languageused here is ambiguous. The versa quotedabove is correctly givenin our grant and, with the next following verse (beginning with the words got *Tf ^),describes Dhruva as the paramount sovereign, The occurrence of the incorrect verse in the Dhulia grant may be cited" as an additional proof of its spurious character. 1 
As the genuineness of the DhtQia plates of Karkaraja is opento question, the first point which we have to decide ia whether Govtada IE. actually succeeded to the throne or whether there was a complete supersessionof him byhis youngerbrother Dhruva after the death o Krishnaraja I."On this point our grant has the followingverse (18) which also occurs ia 4he Kavi3 and Paithan3plates:- 
Here the possessionof the white umbrella, which is symbolical of supreme sovereignty,is attributed to Gcvinda II. Kalidasa sayst

irfwr: u1 
Here WTfl^T fqn; "kings possessedof the white umbrella" means "paramount sovereigns." 
It is thus clear that Govinda II. did in all probability reign immediately after the death of his father Krishnaraja I, I lay stress on this point because the genuineness of the Phulia plates of iCarkaraJEi -which refer themselves to the reignof Govinda 31. may reasonably be called in question, as I have pointedout above. From the Datilatabad grant, which was 
discovered by me three years ago and brought to the notice of Mr. D. B. Bhandarkar, -who has edited it in this Journal,2 it is plainthat Dhruva wrested the sceptre from the hands of Ma elder brother GOvinda II. That Govinda II. did reignis also proved by two pillar inscriptions discovered and 'noticed by Hr. Rice, which use the expression pritfm-r&fyam geyye, "ruling over the earth,'1 with reference to Jagattunga-Prablnitavarsha-Pratapavaloka, son of Akala[varsha].s 
The second question to be decided is the identification of the Srivallabha, mentioned by Jinasena in the concluding ^m^'asH of his Harivamm, -which I quoted in my article in the Indian Antiquary t Vol, XV, p. 142, In a note to my paper, Dr. Fleet proposed to identify the king with Govinda II. A fo^v yearslater a different identification -was proposed, Dr. Fleet then suggested that in the verse 
f^SCf 
the expression ^TWT^ should be construed \vith ^^T^rffrf^ and that ftnjW ^vas Gsvinda III.4 The only reason given for this construction was that"Indrayndhanaman is an adjective and wants the next following word to completeits meaning1/' This is not a serious difficulty for Ka.lida.sa frequently uses Wir-^TR^as a noun.6 And Jinasena himself uses compounds lij^e as nouns ;

This second identification, though abandoned long ago,is now rendered untenable by the Daulatabad grant of Dhruva, dated Saka-Samvat 715. A third attempt was made to

identify Jinasena's Srivallabha, and this time, with Dhruva, The only ground assigned> for this was that "Srivallabha was a leading and distinctive biruda of Dhruva," while Govinda II. was, in Dr. Fleet's opinion, Vallabha and not"Srivallabha, which is quite a different thing."1 Hut from one of the two inscriptions which we owe to Mr, Rice and to which reference has K-pn made above, we learn that Srivallabha -was a title borne by GGvinda II., who is spoken of us Jaijatttiriga-Prabhutavarsba-Prafcapavalcka-Srivallabha. This is a pillar inscription and a f-nttmporaiy document and must have been incised between Saka-Samvat 692 and 697,2 It is evident tint Srivallabha was not a distinctive Urud& of Dhruva. On this account it is hard to decide whether Jinasena's Srivallabha was Govinda II, or Dhrava, Though neither of 
tk- two reasons pat forward by Dr. Fleet, m (1) that Gfovinda II. did not reign and (2) that he had not the title of Srivallabha is correct, his identification of Jinaaena's Srivallabha with Dhmva is warranted by the subjoined inscription. It is dated in Saka-Samyat 697 and the Daalatabad plates of Dhrava in Saka-Samvat 715. Between these two dates Dhruva was the 
mgning sovereign. During this interval Jinasena wrote hie pra&asti of Saka-Samvat 705. Hii Srivallabha, son of king Krishna was, therefore, Dhruva "himself. On the other hand, if the Dhulia plates are also genuine, Jinasena's Srivallabha cannot, at present, be identified, One of the titles of Dhruva is Kalivallabha, which Dr. Fleet always translates favour ite of tfc Kali age." It i. well known that the Kali age is sinful, and to be called favourite of the toilful age can hardly be regarded as complimentary. The real explanation appears to be

No, 20, TIBETAN INSCRIPTION ON THE STONE MONUMENT IN FRONT OF THE TA-OHAO-SSU TEMPLE IN LHASA, 822 A,D. 
Br A, H, 
The stone monument in front o the Ta-chao-ssu. temple contains an inscriptioa in Chinese and Tibetan, of the times of the Tibetan king khri btsong Ida btsan, half of whose name has been preserved on the stone, as observed byBnshell. The Chinese half of the inscription \?as translated by g. W. Bushell in his article entitled "The Early Historyof Tibet" (J. R. A. S,, Vol. XII, 1880, p. 535 &). As far as I know, no attemptto read and translate the Tibetan test has as yet been made. My readingof tne Tihetan text is based on a rabbing of the inscription, reproducedin Bushell's article. This rubbing' was obtained in Peking iu 1869 and was said then, from the condition o the paper, to date at least from the last century.' 
Ancient Orthography* 
(a) Oases of suffixed d (called drag)occur 'mpkyind (1, 20), plvrivd (1. 39), maid (L 55) ; the last case is uncertain. On the -whole, it is safe to saythat the drag is of rare occurrence, as compared with Dr, Stein's Endure relics, 
(b) Subscript y appears below m regularly when the latter is followed byi and $. (c) Inverted i vowel signsare very common, But no uniform rule is followed in their use. (d) In line 26 it looks as if chenpo was furnished with the article phoinstead of po,as is the 
case in some of the Endere relics;but here it may bo due to a scratch on the stone. 
Other instances of the orthographyof the Endero relics (8th century A,D.)are not found here. Thus, the final consonant of a syllableis never written below the first consonant j and c and ts aro never replaced by ch and ths, as at Endere. 
PalcBographtcalNotes, 
All the rowel signs, with the exception of the vowel sign, -are joinedto the consonant base. For the o-sign the left upper end of the consonant is preferred; but in the case of ch,'kk and y it touches the niiddle. The w-aignis joinedto the right lower end of the letter and the e-sign to the xoiddle of its upper line, exceptin the case ofs,m and I, With the two former the e-eign finds a place at the left upperend and with I at the right upperend.

BY PANDIT HiamxDA, M,A.j LAHORE. 
This is a single plate, which measures 13J" wide by18" long, and was found together with the seal"in village Kotwa, parganah Ghiswii, tahsil Machhll^ahr, on the ewt side of the nmnetalled road running from Machhli^ahr to Janghai," when excavations were carried on as famine relief work in the Jaunpnr District of the United Provinces. In January last, Mr, 0. A, C, Sfcreatfield I.C.S., presented it to the Provincial Museum at Lucknow, where it is now deposited. The Curator of the Museum informs me that he received it "in a "bent and twisted condition in conseqnence of which it had to be flattened." It is broken, about the middle and the writing which it bears is also considerably damaged. 
The inscription which is engraved only on one side of the plate comprises 34 lines written in the Sanskrit language and the NiSgari script. The size of the letters 10 between |" and i". As regards orthography, it is enoughto state that no distinction is made between the signs for & and v and that the dental and palatalsibilants are used indiscriminately.

The charter was written bythe MaMltshapajaUka,the Thakkura, BhogSditya. 
The seal accompanying the plateis circular and about 2}" in diameter. Tho ring- on which it is soldered is open. Owing to this circumstance the seal can be taken off or pasHod through the hole cut at the top for this purpose. The seal bears in relief a Garuda and a conch nuI butnreeai these the legend ; rfmata~Hari$chandradevas'ya. 
The record possesses some historical importance, for, to the list of tho kingsof Kunanj if adds owe new name, vis. that of EaridcJiaudra. Indeed, we knew Harischandrix m tho &cm t*f JsyachchADdra from the letter's grants published in the Indian Antiquary (Vol. XVIIL p. JU* ff.) aod^tho Epigraph Indica (Vol. IV. p. 126 *,) But Hari^chandra as a ruling ohiof cf Kama] is mentioned only in the subjoined record. 
The date regularly corresponds, for the Vikrama year 1253 expired (1254 current), u, BandAy, the 8th January AJD, 1197, when the full-moon iitU of Paneha ended 22 li. 5t? m. (ajpproiiaaately) after mean sunriae.

^ischandradeya must have been 21 yearsold at the time of the subjoined inscription. As the ^^t known date of Jayachchandra is A,D. 1187,3 the accession of his son Harigchaadra must taken place between A.D. 1187 and 1197, the date of the present grant. 
The town of Kanauj was completely devastated by Shihab-ud-din in A.D. 1193 and it ia not le surprising that Harischandra is described in the subjoined record as if he were a para- ^nt sovereign. The Belkhara pillar inscription, dated a few months earlier,4 does not mention but represents an un-named kingof the Gahadavala family as granting a village .e than two hundred miles distant from Kanauj. The connection of this king as well as of -j/ischandra with Kanauj was perhaps only nominal. The former was probably residing at ^e town out of the roach of the Muhammadan generalsor officials. Mr. V. A. Smith thinks pf,the king's residence was near Jaunpur.6 ZafarSbad, 4 miles to the south-east of that city, d to have been the site of a palaceof the later rulers of Kanatr}. -Ed.]

Ko, 22, GADYAL PLATES OF YIKRAHADITYA L; A,D, 674, 
BY PROFESSOR E. HULTZBOE, PH.D.; HAUE (SiiLB). 
The owner of these platea ig a school-boyat Knrnool, Madras Presidency. He states that <f the plates -were ia Hs hoaee at G-advaL, HaidaralDad territory, and that some old woman was saying that they were found in the fields." They were broughtto the notice of the Archaeologi cal Department by Mr, 0. V. Doraaami Aiyar, Clerk in the Settlement Office, Knrnool, and were obtained on loan through the Collector. I edit the inscription on them from two seta of excellent ink-impresaionB received from. Rai Bahadur Yenkayya, whose descriptionof the origi nals is subjoined here. 
These are'* three copper-platas, with slightly raised rims, the first and last of which bear writing only on the inner side, The lengthof the platesia 9 inches, while the breadth varies between 4| inches at the middle and 4J- mobea at the two edges. They are strung on. an ellipti cal copper ring which measures 3J* hy 3|* and is j* thick. The ends of the ring are secured at the bottom of a mass of copper, on which ia impressed an almost circular seal which is 1" in diameter. The impression bears the rude figure of a boar in a running posture, facing the proper right. The last plate exhibits a slit which runs from the nearer margin right into the ring-hole. This shows that an attempt may have been made to jemoye the plate from the ring without actually cutting the latter. The platea together with the ring and seal weigh160 tolas."

. 
Tho writing on the platesis in an excellent state of preservation. In some cases the sign of is indistinct and has to be supplied from the context. Throughout the record no mark punctuation is used. The alphabet resembles that of the other grantsof the same period and uasty. Tho secondary forms of i and l are not always clearly distinguished, and hardly any 
is made between the two letters m and chat and between tlio secondary forms of ri ra. The lingual I occurs in the geographical name Cholika, (I. 25) and in the expression rorf/a (L 28) which, as well as salage (1, 31), was taken over from the Telugu verna of tho donee. Among the names of private individuals, three are Prakrit (Chancta and a, 1. 27, and MaJizsara, 1. 29), and three Dravidian (T&tanwna and Padamma> 1. 29, and , 1. 30). But the language of the whole record is Sanskrit, both prose and verse. The of sandjii are scrupulously observed, exceptin three instances (11, 1, 26, and 38). 
The inscription records a grantof land "by the (Western) Chalikya (1. 4 f.) king Vikrama- (!.) the son of Satyasraya (i.e. Pulakesin II.), grandson of KIrtivarman (I.), and great grandson of Pulakesin (I.). Each of these four kings receives the same panegyrical epithets 03 in other grants of the same period. At the end of the descriptionof the reignof Yikrama I. the new grant adds a passage which ia already known from his Haidarabiid plates* the spurious Kurtaksti plates.3 As pointed out byProfessor Kielhorn.3 this passage Consists of four Arya verses. These four verses mention several surnames of Vikramaditya I., tn's. Anivarita,**the unopposed' (verse 2), Srivallabba, 'the favourite of fortune' (verses 3 end 4), Ranarasika,6 'fond of fighting,' and Bajamalla, the wrestler with kings' (verse 5). Verse 8 states that he defeated Narasirhha, Mahendra, and Isvara, i.e. the three successive 3?allava kings Narasimhavarman. I., Mahendravarman II., and Paramesvaravarman I.fi The last of these three kingsis again named as Isvara-Potaraja7 of Kancln in a Vasantatilaka verse (6) which follows after the four Aryas. The conquest of Kanehi, the capitalof the Pallavas, is alluded to also in verse 4. Verse 5 states that Vikramaditya I. destroyedthe Maha jaalla family. As suggested byProfessor Kielhorn,3 this is another reference to the Pallavas ; for Mahamalla seems to have been a surname of Narasiriihavarrnan I., and Mamallapuram. is the ancient name of a Pallava city, the remains of which now go bythe name of' the Seven 
Pagodas.' 
The date of the grant was the nllmoon titln of Vaisakha in the twentieth yearof the reign, which was current after 596 Sftka years had passed (11, 24-2G). This date does not admit of verification ; but, as Dr. Eleet kindly informs me,"the equivalent may be taken as Tuesday, 25th April, A.D. 974, thoughsome authorities might make it the nest day,at any 
rate for any eastern partsof India." It fully confirms tho correctness of the results of Professor Kielhorn's calculations of two other dates of the Same reign.10 
When Vikramaditya I. made this grant,his army had invaded the Cholika-vishaya, i.e. the Chola province,11 and was encamped in Uragapura on the southern bank of the Kaveri river (1. 25 f ,). In sending me the impressions, Mr. Venkayyadrew my attention to the fact

*See Prof. Kielhorn' B remarks, loc. cit. pp. 346 and 359, and compare sarv-a'iivarit'ajiiain verso 10 of the present inscription. Vikramaditya II. may have likewise boruo the surname Auivarifca, which forms part of the names o! two of his officera. See Ind. Ant.

that Uragapura is mentioned in Kalidasa's Raylmvaihsa (vi, 59)1as the capital of the Papdya king, and proposed to identifyit "with, the ancient Ohgla capital Ur.aiyu*r near Trichinopoly, I rather think that TJragapura,'the snake-city/ia a poetical equivalentof IvTSgapattanain (now Negapatam), though this town is at some distance from the sotLthern bank of the KaverL The word Nagapattanain is engravedin Tamil characters on certain small copper coins struck at Negapatam by the Dutch East India Company. The slightlydifferent form NSgapattarjam occurs in the large Leiden plates. The Chinese pilgrim I-tsing, who visited India in the last quarter of tho seventh century, reportsthat the priest Wishing, after travelling from China to India, landed at Nagapatana' and thence embarked for Ceylon.3 The famous pilgrim Hiuen tsiang, who travelled over India in the second quarterof the same century, did not proceed farther south than Corijeevaram, which he notices. But he mentions on hearsay a town farther to the south, from which people used to embark for Ceylon,3 The quotation from I-tsing retakes it very probable that Negapatam is intended by this. Colonel Yale was inclined to identify Negapatam with Ptolemy's Ni/cajm.4 
The grant was made at the request of G-anga-MahSdevi (1. 27), who seems to have been one of the queens of Vikramaditya I, The donees were three Brahraanas, each of whom received fifty nivartanas of land in a village named [Chedu]lli. 
In verse 10 VikramadityaI. is once more praised as a member of the Chalukya family and as the destroyer of the Pallava lineage.

Bi BAKHAL Dig BANERJI, 
The following inscriptions were discovered in the ArchaeologicalSection of the Lucknow Museum during the winter of 1908. The existence of unpublished Brahmi inscriptionsin the Provincial Museum, at Lucknow was well known to the public, and in 1905 Mr. V. A. Smith obtained a complete set of impressionsof them from the Curator. But unfortunately none of these has been published as yet. In 1903 Mr. Smith mentioned four of: them which were stated to have been discovered at Samnagar, an old fort in the BareillyDistrict. Two more are said to hare been found at Mathura. I examined the Archseologicalcollection of the Luc-know Huseum on two different occasions, once, while collecting materials for my eseay on"Tho Scythian period of Indian history"in J-nne 1905, and againin October 1906. On the last occasion, I came across at least three unpublished inscriptions but could not spare enough time for them. ' Subsequently,the task of cataloguing the archaeologicalcollection of the Provincial Museum was entrusted to me byDr. J, Ph. Vogelof the Archaeological Survey and I tad occasiou to go through the collection slowly and carefully. The result was the discoveryoE a number of dated inscriptions and importantmodifications in the readingsof three published ones. The catalogue is not expectedto be out soon jso I am placingthe newly discovered records before the public as earlyas possible. The majorityof sculpturesin the collection of the Lucknow Museum belong to the Scythian period and were discovered "by Dr. A. Fiihrer, Ph.D., of the Archaeological Survey. The collection also contains a large number of MatfrurS

sculptures discovered and figured by Growse and others which were presentedto the Agra Museum. The collection thus comprisesthe following materials : 
(1) Some of the sculpturescollected hyGrrowae and otlier local officers of the Mathura District up to the year1886. 
(2) The sculptures discovered duringthe excavations carried on byDrs. 3?uhrer and Burgess at Mathura duringthe years 1888-96. 
(3) The sculptures discovered byDr. liihrer at Ramnagar,the ancient Ahicbchhattra in the Bareilly District in the wiuter of 1891-93. 
None of the inscriptions from Ramnagar have ever been properlyedited. Translations of three of them have appeared in Dr. Fuhrer1s Reportof the EpigraphicalSection for 1901-02, ont of which ouly one has been found. Ihe rest could nob be traced either in the- galleries or the Tahklicvna of the Lucknow Provincial Museum. 
Fourteen out of the twenty-one inscriptions edited Hera are absolutely new. The late Dr. Biihler published three inscriptions with facsimiles and the rest have been casually noticed or edited by Messrs. Growse, Smith and others. Those which have been already edited by Biihler are republished. because, on examiningthe original, I found that his readings required considerable modifications. Two of the inscriptions (Kos.II. and VI.) were published by Growse with facsimiles in his Mathura. 
The excavations at Ramnagarhave yielded some importantrecords. One of them (No. I,) mentions the territorial name Pafiehala, while another inscription (No. XVI.) evidently from the same place refers to the name of the capital city [AdM]clichliattra. The identity of Eamnagar with Ahichchhattra seems to be certain. 
The language of the inscriptionsis corrupt Sanskrit. I am indebted to Mr. Marshall for the photographs published here. They were taken byhis photographer Babu Brajendra tfath Dey last winter. 
The back views of two images,. that of the year 9 (Plate I.) and of the year 80 (Plate VIII.), show the deterioration of the Mathura school of sculpture. The subjectis the same in both cases, ws. a tree with flowers. The earlier sculpture shows a tall tree with a graceful trunk and proportionateflowers and leaves. But the later sculptureis ugly and disproportionate.No other Mathura sculpturein the Luckuow Museum bears any carving on its back though many of them are carved in the round. 
I. INSCRIPTION ON A COPING-STOKE. 
The inscription was found on the topof a split copingof yellowsandstone which was used as a prop to a large"tablet of homage."1 It was completely hidden under the large slab and was discovered when the latter wag being taken out to be cleaned. The sculptare came most probably fmm Riimnagar,the anoient Ahichchhattra, in the BareillyDistrict, The Curator's Report for the month of April 1892 mentions"1 copingstone with inscription of theSakaera(datedSamvat5) .... Excavated from the old site of a large Buddhist temple at Ramnagar, Rohilkhand."8 Dr. Fuhrer most probably took the word P5*ottZfyfl' of Pa&cMla' in line 8 for a date. The alphabet belongsto the class which Biihler called Kshatopa characters. Theyare older than what Messrs. Vogeland Mders style Early Kusuana. The inscription is dated in the first yearof the reignof a king (?) whose name is lost.

n.INSCRIPTION ON THE BASE OF A BODHISATTVA IMAGE. 
This fragment was discovered, accordingto Grrowse, in a mound near the Circular Road at Mathura.1 The languageis corrupt Sanskrit and the characters are neat and well incised. They belong to the early Kushana period. The important point ahont this inscriptionis that it is a Bodhisattva image and not a Buddha imageas Growse calls it, The inscription consists of a single mutilated line on the upper rim of the pedestal (Lucknow Museum Catalogue No. B-18.)

The pedestalis one of the finest piecesof carving turned out by the Mathura school of Bculptors.

The mutilation of the first few letters of the inscription and the loss of the main figureis greatly to be deplored, as they would have been very importantfor the history of Indian

HI, INSCRIBED JAINA IMAGE, THE TEAR 9. 
Nothing is known about the findspotof this image.It stands in the Jaina section of the Imcknow Museum, and, judging from its workmanship,is most probablya productof the Mathura school. The discoveryof the BCdhisattva imagesof Sarnath and Sravastl has made us chary in the matter of assigning findspotsof antiquities extempore. No references either to the sculpture or to the inscription have been found in Dr. Puhrer's Annual Reportsor in tie Minutes of the Lucknow Museum. The imageis headless and belongsto the Digambara sect (Plate I., Front), The Jina evidentlystands on a cushion placed on an openinglotus. To his proper right two men are standing with hands folded in adoration and their backs turned towards each other. To the properleft a female figurine stands with a flywhisk (?) in her hands. The- image is carved in the round. On each flank is a tall slender pilaster with a bell shaped capital and a square abacus which againbears a coupleof rosettes on its rim. The pilaster on the proper left has been damaged bythe incision of a squaremortise hole. The reverse is occupied by the representationof a tall tree with bunches of small four petalled flowers which resemble the asdka blossom, A female stands to the properleft of the tree holding a garland in the right hand, while in front of her a child stands with hands folded in adoration. To the right of the tree is a vessel made of leaves containinga garland and by its side a male is standing with clasped hands (see pi. I,). 
The inscription consists of three short, irregular lines, of which one is incised on the edge of the cushion and the others on the lotus petals j two short fragmentarylines are incised between toe feet of the Jina. The languageis the usual corrupt Sanskrit common in inscrip tions of this kind and the characters are of the Northern Indian typeof the Kushana period. The epigraph is dated in the year 9 of the Kushana era and must probablybe referred to the

reign of the emperor Kanishka. Another record o the same date mentioningthe name of Kanishka is already known,1thoughits present localityis indefinite, The subjoined inscription records the erection of the image by a female named G-ahapala at the request of the venerable Tarika.

1. The first syllable of the word Slvasiri may also be read as Avasiri.

3. It seems that the lotas petals were carved after the incision of the inscription* The loss of the letter sa in the word Tarikasyacan. hardlybe otherwise accounted for. 4 The word Sakliatd has almost entirely vanished on account of the attempts of the mason employed by the Lucknow Museum authorities to remove the cement from the inscribed por tion. 
5. The reading of the last two words of the third line is uncertain, A copious nee of cement has made them almost illegible,

The intervouiug Hpaco between the lions is occupied by a bas-relief. In the centre of the bas-roliof is a wheel on a short lu do-Corinthian pi latter with two capitals and a square abacus, while a devotee is seated on the ground on each side.

V. -INSCRIBED IMAGE OF S AM BHAVANATHA, THE TEAR 48, 
This image was found in one of the smaller rooms of the Jaina section of the Imcknow Museum without any label or aamber. There is no particular mentioa either of the image or of the inscription in the Minutea or the Annual Reportsof the Lucknow Provincial Museum, 
This is the only known Btatne of Sarabhavanalha (Plate III.)> the third Jina, discovered at Mathurii during this period. Figuresof Rishabhanatha, Neminatha, Parsvanjttha and JMahftvira have been met with. It is to be noted that Jaina images of the Soythian period cannot be identi fied satisfactorily unless the names are mentioned in their inscriptions. Most probably, distinctive symbols (c.hihna') were assignedto the respectiveJin as at a much later period. Those dis tinguishing symbols "have nobbe^n found in any Jaina image of the Scythian period discovered up to date. The earliest known Jaina statue with a distinctive symbol is the image of Rishabhanatha from the Kankall Tlla mound near Matliura figuredin Mr, V. A, SmitVa Jaina stupa (Plate XCVIII). Unfortunatelyit is uninscribed, but may be assignedto the 4th or the 5th century of the Christian era OQ account of its technique, 
The head and one arm are broken. The Tirthamkara ia seated in the dhyanctmidra posturo on a throne supported by a coupleof lions. The space under the throne between the lions is occupied by a bas-relief, showingthe Triratna symbol resting on a small wheel and supporting a larger one, Two conches are leaning against the smaller wheel, while a small leaf is added to each side of the larger wheel. The groupingis exactly the same as on the Jaiua pedestal, now in the Lucknow Museum, dedicated in the year 49.1 A male figure stands to the rightof this group of symbols, and a female to the left. They hold flowers iu their right hands while their left hands are akimbo.

f The use of the word between the year and the mouth of a dated inscription can have no significance. The word occ"ara also in the MathurB lion capital inscriptions (ante, Vol. IX. p. 141). Here however the coutert ie different and Mr. IP. W. Thomas has taken the word to denote a proper name, 
$ Ante, Vol. I. p. 387, No. 9 and Plate, 
Hid, p. 392, No. 24, and Plate.
114 EPIGRAPHIA INDICA, [VoL,   
On examining the originals carefullyI found that tLe date iu one of them is iiofc forty-four bat fifty-eight, expressed in words. The following considerations led me to this conclusion : (1) The first syllable after the word sava[tsa]relias been read byDr. Biihler as y/or the numerical symbol for 40. But it would be better to take it as a form of the letter a (c,f, above, Vol. VIII. plate facing p. 176, i, f.). 
(2) The second syllable has been taken by "Dr. Biihler to bo a numerical symbol. But it is evidently the componnd letter shta, The plate published alonj* with this paper was prepared from an impression taken under my personal supervision and shows the letter sJ*ta better than the facsimile issued with Vol. I. of this Journal. 
(3) Tho third letter was taken by Dr. Biihler to be ha but the absence of the horizontal stroke at the top of the vertical line on the proper right pliowa that it is j"< The left hand vertical line is slightly curved, but it should be borne in mind that the characters of Jairta iuscriptions of the periodare alwayscursive*cf. the hit of Maharaja iu the same line. 
The word yana occurs in two other Bra-hmi inscriptions from Mathurii published by the late Dr. Biihler. Ono of them is dated in the year 50 (ante, Vol. II. p. 203, No, XVII), which is preceded by the word puna and tho other in the year 52, to which is prefixed the wjrd dL\tpan(L (Hid, No. XV111). In the present inscription wo have got ashtapanu,, which I have rendered bylfifty-eight,' The word jj wit is apparently an abbreviation of tho "Pali pannasa, fifty.' In the inscriptionof the your SO, where the word punaalso occurs, according to 
1 
Dr. Biihlor's text, it is a misreadingfor Jmmata, as I shall show later on in this paper, With my corrections the text of tho subjoined inscription runs as follows : 1 Sdhafiia]1 Kama Sara[sa]tama Maharajas[ya] Huvakshasya sa[m]vasare ashtapana grafsyaj maaa 3 [da]visa2 2 e[ta]-

Remarks. 
1. This word occurs in many other cognate inscriptions. There is a symbol preceding mof nama which 1 cannot explain, 
2. Perhaps the word was pronounced dnvisa aa is still tho case in Bengal and Assam; read divasa, 
3. There is an unexplained symbol after tho ahbara ye. Perhapsit is dne to a crack in the stone,

Only the waist and the thighsof the .Tina are extant (Plate IV). The pilustov on the reverse is most probably the staff of the umbrella under which tfefr image originally stood. Such cases are by no means unconinion in the Mathurii sculpturesof tl 3 Scythian period. The inscription, though fragmentary,is an important one. It presentsn, large number of diffic-nltiea both in decipherment and translation. The moat important part however is the date which iw

1. The anusrara is indistinct.

It resembles the symbolfor 10 to some extent, but the presence of a numerical symbolat this place cannot be explained. 4. The remaining syllables in the third line seem to constitute a proper name with the genitive case ending. The letter no, is rare in Mathura inscriptions, althoughit is to be found in the inscriptions of the Western Satraps. 
5. Of more interest is the form sushoti in the next line. The o in slid is formed bythe combination o a and u and the affix: ti is quite new. It resembles to some extent the Bengali affix ta as in malmdi a,"maternal uncle's sbn,"|?wSiat"son of a paternalaunt.*' The wr-M probably is an apablwanisaof the Sanskrit svasriya and the whole phrase most probably means * f sister's daughter's daughter."

IX. INSCRIBED CHATUKMUKHA FROM BAKNAGAB, THE YEAE 74, 
The discovery of this inscription was announced byDr, Fiihrer in his Progress Reportfor the year 1891-92. But all the details have been omitted, The inscriptionis incised on four sides of the pedestal of a Chatwrmuk'ha or four-fold imageof a Tlrthamk'ara, as Dr. Btihler used! to call them (Plate VI). Bach of the four faces of the pedestalbears a bas-relief. On 
the larger faces, the bas-relief consists of a wheel on an Indo-Persepolitan pilaster in the centre with three devotees, standingwith folded hands, on each side. The bas-relief on the smaller faoes is almost similar and consists of two devotees only on each side of the pillar. 
The inscription consists of two lines ^more or less mutilated on each face, Tho second lino of the third face has broken away/ The-emgraphrecords the dedication of some object the name of which is lost, in the 74th yearj'pr&araaDlyof the Kushanfc era,

X. INSCRIBED IMAGE FROM MATHURA, THE TEAR 80. 
This image was discovered in the Kaakali mound near Mathura (Plates YII and VIII), and the inscription on it was published by Dr. Biihler (No. 66 of Professor Luders' List, above, p, 13),1 This is the other inscription referred to above (p. 113 ) in which, accordingto Dr, Biihler, the word hana occurs. On comparing the original with the photo-lithograph published by Dr. Biihler it was found that the words liana, va 1 as read by Biihler are nothing but Jiamava 1, which probablystands for liamata 1.

XI INSCRIBED BAS-RELIEF FROM MATEURA, THE TEAR 99. The inscription is incised alongthe raised border of a fragmentary bas-relief on yellow sand stone. The bas-relief consists of two panels -with raised borders. The lower one is larger but its lower part is broken. The smaller panelat the topis in good preservation. It consists of a stupa in the centre with two Jinas on each side seated in the attitude of meditation under umbrellas. The Jina on the proper left of the stupa has no umbrella on his head. A seyen headed snake takes the placeof the umbrella and shows that it is Parsvanatha, the 23rd Tir thamkara. The inscriptionis incised on the rims at the top and bottom of this panel. The lower panel contains the upper partof a woman's figure standing with her left hand on her hipa and the right one lifted up. A small inscription consistingof two lines has been incised over her right shoulder (A). To her left stands a nnde male figure, evidently an ascetic, with a piece of cloth on his left wrist. In the space between the heads of these two figures occurs the inscription B. Two female figurines are standingto the left of the ascetic and behind them appears the upper part of the figureof a Naga king under a tree -with his hands folded in sup plication. On each side of this groupis a pillar with a bell shaped capital, of which the one on the left is surmounted by a wheel. A drawingof this bas-relief has been published by Mr. Smith.* The inscription has already been published byDr.Bahlerf (No. 75 of Professor Liiders1List, aboye, p. 15) though Mr. Y. A. Smith did not notice it at first. The original inscriptiondiffers in two or three places from Dr. Biihler's readings.

the portion below the -waist is extant (Plate III), Accordingto Mr. V. A. Smith (Jaina Shvpa, p, 56, plate XC1X) the sculpture was discovered in the Kankali mound. The drawing pablished by him is inaccurate, The impression and photograph publishedherewith will show   
the details of the discrepancies. Mr. Smith'sreading, based on his drawing,is also incorrect, Inscriptions on waist bands are very uncommon in India.

"The gift of Pusabala, the wife of Dhamavadhaka (Dhamamrdlia'ka)." XV.-FRAGKENT OF AN INSCRIBED PAVEMENT SLAB. 
The sculpture on which this inscription has been incised is evidentlya fragment of a pave ment slab.2 The carving consists of an ornamental border of twisted rope pattern with cylindri cal clasps at corners. Ths accompanying photograph (Plate VI) shows a fragment of another similar sculpture. The inscription on it has been edited byDr. Buhler (No. 113 of Professor Liiders1List, above, p. 20). The ornamentation is precisely the same, the placeof the rope pattern being taken by lotus petals, The upper right hand corner bears some chisel marks apparently unexplainable. But the other sculpture mentioned above most probablyaffords a means of explanation. The inscription on thatsculpture too, which is entire, has been published by Dr. Buhler (No. 119 of Professor Luders' List, above, p. 21), The ornamen tation is precisely the same as in the two fragments pablished herewith on plate VI, The ouly difference is that there is a large squarehole in the centre of the- slab. This, I believe, explains the chisel marks on the largerslab in the photograph.3 This slab, then, must ha?e had a similar hole in its centre. The object of these squareholes is not verydifficult to describe. Several of the Jaiua statues in the Luckriow Museum possess massive tenons imder the bases. These tenons were most probablylet into the square mortise holea in the pavement slabs. This suppositionis strengthened bythe fact that the inscriptions on similar slabs are not incised near the centre bat alongthe' boi-ders. The majorityof images of this period were carved in the round and were placedinside rooms or shrines pavedwith similarly carved slabs.

The date is perfectly regular, and correspondsto Wednesday, December 29, 1053 A.D. On that day, which vras the sixth solar day of Makara, at mean sunrise, the second tithi of the second fortnight of Paushawas current, and it lasted for 19 h. 12 m.

"In the third year (<?/ thereign) of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Viterama-Choladeva, on the day of Hasta, which corresponded to a Monday and to the seventh tithi of the second fortnight of the month of Makara." 
This date is irregular. Kielhorn hasclearly established the 29th June, A.D. 1118, to bethe accession-day of Vikrama. The solar month of Mafeara in his third year must therefore fall early in-AJX 1121. The seventh tttU of the second fortnight in Mekara of that yearfell on a large portion of Wednesday, January 12, 1121, and a small portion of Thursday, January 13th. During that seventh tithi the mhUairas weia Chitra and Svati. The fifth tithi, however, of the second fortnight (if we may assume a mistake to have occurred)of this month of Makara eeems a little closer. It fell on Monday, January 10, U21 A.D., which was the 18th of Makara. 
The MM lasted for about 23 h. 19 a. after mean sunrise. On that % Hasta began, by the equal spaoo system and by Garga, 8 h. 31 m., and by the Brahma-Biddhanta, 5 h. 7 m. after raeau sunrisej but according to the usual custom the day would hare been called, not Hasta bnt Uttara-Phalgum.

"In the fifth year (of the reign}of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Vikrama-Choladeva, on the day of Hasta, which corresponded to a Wednesday and to the thirteenth tithi of the first fortnightof the month of Simha." 
-This date is irregular. Simha in the fifth yearof Yikrama-Ohsla fell in A.D. 1122. On "Wednesday, August 16th of that year, which was the 20th Simha, the twelfth tithi of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada ended and the 13th began about 16 h. 5 m, after mean sunrise ; bnfc the nakshatras during those two tithis were Uttarashadha, Abhijit and Sravana. It is useless to go into further details, A comparisonof this date with Kielhorn's No, 22 (p. 3, Vol. VII. above) shows this at once. That inscription mentioned tha dayof Ardra, which correspouded to Monday, and with the eleventh tithi of the second fortnight of Sravana in solar Simha in the fifth year of the king. That date IB perfectly regularfor July 31st, A,D. 1122, Now the present data is seventeen days later than No. 22, and it is clear that a day seventeen dayslater than Ardra cannot possiblyfall under the na'ks'hatra Hasta. 
On the supposition that in the original the quotednakshatra might have been Avitfattu instead of Att&ttu, i.e. Dhanishtha instead of Hasta, the date still works oat incorrectly. The thirteenth iifhi of the first fortnight of Bhadtapada in solar Simha in the yearin question could be connected for the time lying between 9 h. 50 m. and 15 h. 22 m. after mean sunrise on Thurs day, August 17th, A.D. 1122, with the nafakatra Dhanishtha ;bat the week-day has been given as Wednesday in the inscription. Moreover the day which would be called the' dayof Dhanishtha ' was Friday.3

This date is also uusatisfaotory, the elements beinguncertain. There seems to be no doubt that ifc belongs to the ^th year of Vikrama-ChOla, and probably, almost certainly, to the month Simha. It is not certain which lunar fortnightis referred to. The day wag Thursday ;but the naksliatra can only be guessed at from two unmutilated aksharas.

from this it lias been assumed that the titki in question was the thirteenth of the fortnight (see note 4, p. 123). Now in the yearA. D. 1123 which, after June 29th, was the sixth yearof Vikrama-ChCla, in the month Simha, the thirteenth tithi of the first fortnightfell on a Moaday and all the thirteenth tithi of the second fortnightalso fell on a Monday (except that it expired 4 minutes after mean sunrise on the Tuesday).I tested the date on the basis of the na,kshatra> to see what days corresponded with Satabhishajin that month of Sim ha. By the equal space system Satabhishaj expired 15 h. 13 m. after mean sunrise on Thursday, August 9th, A.D, 1123, which was the first dayof tke second fortnight, and was the thirteenth day of Simha, On that Thursday the first tithi of the second fortnight began 4 minutes before mean sunrise arid lasted all day,1By the systemof Garga Salabhishaj expired3 h. 20 m., and by the Brahma-si dd ha ota 4 h. 24 m,,after mean sunrise. There was no other Satabhishajin that month of Simha. 
Now this day Thursday, August 9th, A.D. 1123, exactlyfits the elements of the givendate if in the original the word following "pakkatfai" was not piradasika (for pradoshaka)but some word implying the first tithi of the second fortnight.3

This date has given me a great deal of trouble. Accordingto the transliteration given is clearly decipherable j the solar month is doubtful;the lunar day 
above, the 8th regnal year 
and fortnight are clear; and so are the weekday and nakshatra, This being so, I have tested all the days in the 8th regnal year of Vikrama-Chola correspondingto the ninth tithi of the first fortnight in each month, and without success. The nearest approach was in the month Sirhha. The eighth t it hi of the first lunar fortnightof Sravana in that solar month expired 13 k 15 m, after mean sunrise on a Saturday, which was the twelfth day of Simha, and corresponded to Saturday, August 8th, A.D. 1125, At that moment the ninth titlii began, vie. at abont 7-15 P.M. on the Saturday. But accordingto the equal space system, the nakshatra, which had been Anuradha upto about 54 P.M. that day or 11 h. 4 m. after mean sunrise, changed at that moment to Jyeshtha ; so that Anuradha had expired 2 hi 11 m. before the ninth tithi began. Using the systemof Garga the result is the same. By the Brauma-siddlianta the nakshatra Anuradha expired 6 h, 14 m. after mean sunrise. As a fact, therefore, there was no period which satisfies all the requirements. 
The ninth tithi of Makara fell on a Monday and Tuesday, with the natohatras Bharani and Krittika. 
The date cannot be depended upon.4

The elements of this date are inaccurate for the now known eighth regnal yearof Kulcfc tunga-Chdja I., as also for his eighth yearas an Eastern Chalakya sovereign; the former corresponding with A,D. 1077-78, the latter with 1070-71, They are also inaccurate for the eighth year of Kulo'ttunga-Cho'laIII. 
For the reign of Kulottunga-Chola H, whose accession-date has not yet been fixed, hut who certainly succeeded Vikrama-Chola and preceded Eajarajall., I have examined the given date in every year from 1135 to 1152 A.D. which appeared to me the outside limits of possibility. The king known as"Kulottunga-Cho'da"is shown by the CheUtir plates (Ind. Ant. XIV. 55 ?.) to be identical with this Kulottufiga-CholaII. Kielhom has shown (above, Vol. VII. p. 9) that he was living- in A.D. 1143. He was the son of Vikrama, It is desirable that I should publish the nearest approximationsto correctness that occur in- the period 1135 1152 A.D., so that those thoroughly acquaintedwith South-Indian practiceas regardsthe joining of special rites and festivals with the civil days may be enabled to decide whether in anyof those cases all {he requirementsof the date are satisfied. For other years the date is irregular. 
1. The Kumbha-samara^* of Kaliyuga4238 occurred 23 h. 51 m. after mean sunrise on ^Friday, January 22nd, A.D. 1137. The fourteenth tithi of the second fortnightof Magha expired 10 h. 7 m. after mean sunrise on that day, and was not current at the following midnight ; and at that midnightthe actually current solar month was not Kumbha but Makara, though the ILnTCLtib&'Saihkranti occurred 5 h. 51 m. later. As to the ndk&hatra it was Sravana at mean sunrise on the Friday and until 21 h, 30 m. later; Sravana was therefore current at th e midnight of Friday.- Now, if the Maha-Sivaratrl festival, which occurs at midnight,could be connected with the fourteenth tithi which had expired7 h. 53 m, before the Friday midnight tben the elements Friday,the fourteenth tithiat the second fortnight,the Sivaratri festival and the Sravana nahskatra, all agreewith this date. Bat even then I hardlythi ok that the festival could be connected with the solar month Kumbha, whose initial $a,?hkranti did not occur till 6 h. 51 m. after that midnight. The date is therefore doubtful. If expertsin South-Indian rites and ceremonies can reconcile all the elements, then the date may correspondto Friday, January 22nd, A.D. 1137. There was another fourteenth da,y of the second fortnight,via. of Phalgtma, in this month of Kumbha, but it does nob suit the other elements of the givendate. 
2. The Kumblia-sawifcrawte' of Kaliyuga4242 occurred 41 m. after mean sunrise on Thurs day, January 23rd, A.D. 1141, and at mean sunrise on Friday, February 7th, in that yearthe fourteenth tit hi of the second fortnightof Magba was current.

Maha-Sivaratri wliicli took placeat that midnight might have been connected with it. In Professor Kieih.orn*s notes cm Hindu Festal Days,I find that the MahH-Sivaratri festival of the 14ith krishna of Magha is considered very auspicious when it is joined with the yoga Siva, and this happened to be the case on this particular Friday, The y5ga Parigha ended shortly after sunrise on that day, and Siva was current at the following midnight,or at the moment of the Sivaratri. The date, however, is unsatisfactoryin the matter of the nakshatra. The nahshqtra Sravana had expired 3 h. 9 m, lefore mean sunrise on that Friday,1 and during the whole of Friday, including the Sivaratri moment of midnight, the nakshatra was Dhanishthii. 
3. On the twelfth dayof Kumbha, Kaliyoga 4245, which correspondedto Friday, February 4th, A.D, 114-Jj, the fourteenth fatlii of the secoud fortnightof Magha expired 13 h, 58 m. after mean aunrisa. It was not therefore current at the Friday midnight, but nevertheless the Friday would have been coupled with it. This day, the fourteenth of the dark fortnightof Magha, was the day of the Maha-Sivaratri festival; and the occasion was especially auspicious^ because the hour of midnightcoincided with the yo"ga Siva. The yoga at mean sunrise was Parigha, but Siva began at 9-4 P.M. and was current at midnight. The nakshatra Sravana expired, by the equal space system, 51m. after mean sunrise on Friday, and the same by Garga. By the Brahma-siddhanta it expired 2 h. 18 m. after sunrise, I find no fault in this date. 
4, On the twenty-fourth dayof Kumbha, Kaliynga 4252, which correspondedto Friday, February 16th, 1151 A,D., the fourteenth iitlii of the second fortnightof Magha, which was a Maha-Sivaratri day, began 6 h. 35 m. after mean sunrise, was current at midnight, which was the moment of the festival, and expired 8 h. 9 ra. after mean sunrise on the Saturday. Tho nakshatra Sravana had, however, expiredbefore sunrise on that Friday by all systems, and during the whole of that day and till very shortlybefore sunrise on the Saturday the ruling nakshatra was Dhamshtha. Satabhishaj began 1 h. 34 m. before sunrise on the Saturday, by the equal space system and Garga. This date therefore would be satisfactoryif the nakshatra had been quoted as Dhanishtha and not Sravana ;but I consider the date, February A,D. 1151, boo late to be in the eighth yearof Kulottunga-CholaII. He succeeded Vikrama whose reign began in AJX 1118, and who is declared by several inscriptions to have reigned for 15 yeara, though we have records of him as late as 1135 A.D. That, however, is MB latest known date. 
Of the four dates now analyzed, the nearest, and in my opinionthe most probable,is No. 3, viz. IPriday, February 4th, A.D. 1144. The Chellur grantof this king appearsto have been issued in 1143, but the regnal yearis not given there. If I am right, the present inscription would make the reign begin between February5th A,D. 1136 and February 4th A,D, 1137,3

I have tested all the years bearingthe cyclic name Hemalaraba from A.D. 997, which was tlie twelfth regnal yearof Bajaraja-ChOla I, dowa to A.D. 1297, which might possibly have been in the reign of a king hitherto unknown to us by name. In no case, however are all the elements of the date reconciled except in A.D, 1177, which was a Hemalamba year, but was the fifteenth and not the twelfth regnal yearof Rajadhiraja n. From the date alone I am led to believe that the inscription records an event in the fifteenth year1 of Bajadhiraja II correspondingto Saturday, January 21st, A,D. 1178, which was the 28th day of Makara. On that day,at^rneansunrise, the first tithi of the first fortnight of Magha was current, and the nafohatva was Sravishtha.

This is precisely the same date as the last, and it is barely possible that it mightbe regular if the original contained the week-day"Sunday" ;but this is unlikely, since the nakshatw Punarvasu could only be connected with the Sunday by the systemsof Gargaand tho Brahrna siddhanta ;and then onlyfor 31 m. before mean sunrise on the Monday bythe former, and for 2 h, Cm. by the latter.

132 EPIGRAPHIA. INDICA. [Vot. X.   
"In the 3[l]st year, xvhich was tbe (cyclic) year Sukla, (ofthe reign} of the glorious Kulottufiga-Chdladeva, the emperor of the three worlds, -who was pleasedto take Maduwii and the crowned head of the Paudyn,on the occasion of the vernal equinox (Ohailra-vishui-a), which correspondedto (the day of) Svati, to a Tuesday and to the first tiihi of the second fortnight." 
This date is correct in all particulars. The cyclic year Sukla in question was A,D. 1209-10 | and the vernal equinox on the 24th March, A.D. 1209, was in the thirty-first yearof KulQttuhga-Chcla III. That day was a Tuesday, and was the last dayof the month Mma. The vernal equinox occurred at 18 h. 22m. after mean sunrise bytlie Arya-siddhanta, and 19 h. 40m. after itby the Surya-eiddhiinta. Whichever authority was used the result is similar. At mean sunrise that day the first tithi of the second fortnightof Chaitra Was current, and it lasted for 4 h. 32 m, The nakshnkra Svati was current at mean sunrise, and expired by the equal-space system 20 h. 23 in. later, by Garga8h. llm. later, and bythe Brahma Biddhanta 4 h. 4 m. later. 
It is evident from this that the calculators who framed the calendars of that time and place coupled with the dayon which the vernal equinoxoccurred the name of the tithi current at mean sunrise of thai day, a ud not the name of the tithi actually current at the moment of the equinox. For, at the moment of the vernal equinox,the second tithi of the second fortnight was current. This adhesion to mean sunrise as fixing the tithi coupled with the day is strongly marked in Kielhorn's Chela No. 70 (above, Vol. VII., pp. 172-3 J where, though a thirteenth tithi ended onlya minute or two after mean sunrise,it is mentioned as the day's equivalent tithi, in lieu of the 14th.

This date might be accurate for the fifteenth yearof Rajendra-ChSla II., otherwise called KulSttunga-Chola I., and is certainly accurate for the fifteenth yearof RajendrA-Chola III. In the former case most of the elements coincide, the date being Thursday, October 10th, A.D. 10S4, at mean sunrise on which day the ninth tithi of the first fortnightof Kfirttika was current, expiring 19 h. 29 m, later; bat the nakshatra at mean sunrise was Sravana, Sraviahtha (or Dhanishtha) beginning 4 h. 39 in. later bythe equal space system and Garga, and 6 h, C ra. later by the Brahma-siddhanta. ,The date is so far defective.

Bat for the fifteenth yearof Rajendra.-Cho'laIII. all the elements of the date coincide. In that year on Thursday, October 14th, A.D. 1260, -which was the seventeenth dayof Tula, the ninth tithi of the first fortnightof Kavttika ended 16 h. 55 m. after mean sunrise ;the wk+ shatra Sra-vishtha was current at mean sunrise byall systems, expiring 21 h. 14 in. later bythe equal-space system and by Garga, and 22 h. 21 m. later by the Brahma-siddhanta. 
I sim inclined, therefore, to think that the latter date is the correct one, but the matter can certainly be settled on epigraphic grounds,there being a wide difference between tbo characters of an inscriptionof A.D. 1084 and one of A.D. 1260. 1 ba~ve not had a facsimile of

The only test possible in the case of dates givenin this form is to ascertain whether the week-day corresponds with the other data. In this case it does so, and I have no doubt as to its correctness.

The date is correct. Chaitra in Saka 1071 expiredfell in A.D, 1149. On Friday, March 25th, A.D, 1149, the 15th tithi of the first fortnightof Chaitra was current, expiring 23 h,53m, after mean sunrise.

I find this date unsatisfactory.

AsMdha fell on Sunday. Thinkingthat a mistake might have been made in the fortnight I tested the lltb tithi -of the dark fortnightin both months, finding the week-days SnDday in adhika Ashadha and Monday in nija Ashadha.' In the latter, case, the llth iifhi of the dark fortnight had expired 3 h. 45 m, "before mean sunrise on the Tuesday. 
The result of the examination of Nbs. 186, 187, 188, 189, is to show that the date of the accession of Kulottunga-Choda H lies between March 26th and July 14th, A.D. 1133. This leads me to reconsider the fonr possible dates givento No. 166 (above, p. 125 f.). That date was in this king's eighth year; and while (hayingthatdate^aloneto go by)I stated my opinion that it correspondedto the third of my results, in which date I could find no fault in the elements, vis, Friday, February 4th, AD. 1144, I now think that the second of my results is the true one, namely, Friday, February 7th, A.D. 1141. Its defect layin the fact that the quoted naksliatra, Srayana, was one which had expiredthree hours before mean sunrise on that day, and which could not therefore properlybe connected with the Friday, Dhamshtha being the correct naksliatra. But otherwise the result showed that the combination of elements on that day was highly auspicious, and I am of opinion that this fixture may now be accepted, and that the framers of the inscription had made a mistake in their calculation of the nakshafrra. February 7th 1141 A.D. would fall in this king's 8th year. The mention of the Saka year in combination with the regnal yearin the four regulardates given above may be accepted., for the present at least, as determiningthe date of accession of Kulottanga-ChSla II. It follows that March 24th, A.D. 1143, the date of the Chelliir plates (Ind. Ant. Vol. XIV. p. 56 ft 5 above, Vol. VII. pp. 910) fell in this king's tenth

This inscription proves that the Pandya king Maravannan Stindara-Pandya I., whose reign has been determined by the late Professor Kielhorn to have begun between the 29th March and the 4th September A.D. 1216, reignedto a later date than has been previonsly supposed. Tbe latest date hitherto verified of this king is, I believe, the 19th February, A.D. 1235 (above, Vol. VI. p, 303), This appears in an inscription at Tinnevelly.3 The present inscription,in a temple in the Tinnevelly District, bears a date correspondingto January 29th, 1237 A.D..

The date is regular. On Thursday, January 29th, A.D. 1237, the first day of the bright fortnight of Phalguna ended 5 h. 81 m. after mean sunrise. The solar day was the 6th Kumbha, By the equal space system the naksfiatrn Satabhishaj was current at mean sunrise and ended 9 h. 46 m. later. By the system of Cfarga Satabliishaj hadexpire^. 2 h. 22 m. before sunrise ; and by the Brahrna-siddhanta it had expired1 h. 19 m. before sunrise. This seems to shew that the equal space system of nakahatras was used at that time and place. 
The inscription does not affect Professor Kielhorn's limits (March 29th to September 4tn) for the beginning of the reignof this king.

the glorious [Vira]-Pandyadevaj on the dayof MUla, which correspondedto the tenth tithi and to a [Thursday] of the first fortnightof the month of Simha." 
This date is precisely correct for the Vira-Pandya,of whom two inscriptions, viz. in his 7 fch and 15th years, hare been published byProfessor Kielhorn (above, Vol. VII, pp. 10-11). His reign began, accordingto that authority, between llth November 1252 and 13th July 1253. The 10th November 1267 waa in his 15th year, and the present date is correct in all respect? for 8th August 1269. It is incorrect for the years 1270 and 1271, 
In 1269 the 10th. tithi of the bright fortnightof Bhadrapada ended 18 h. 55 m, after mean sunrise on the llth day of solar Simha, which correspondedfco Thursday, 8th August, A.D 1269. On that day the naksJiatra was, by the system,of Garga, Hfila for 13 h. 58 m. after mean sunrise, and by the Brahma-eiddhanta, for 8 h. 89 ra. By the equal space systemit was Jyeshtha for 1 h, 50 m, after mean sunrise, and then Mula for the rest of the day. 
The date confirms Professor Kielhorn's limits for the accession of this king,It also confirms the suggestion made byMr. Venkayyain his Annual Reportfor 1907-8, para. 45, that the Yira-Pandya who immediately preceded Mar.a rarman Kulasekhara I. was the same as this Jatavarman Vira-Pandya. Henceforth we may give him his propertitle. 
Since Ms reign began in A.I) . 1252-53 and lasted at least 17 years, Jatavarman Vira Pandya was ruling for at least 8 yearsat the same time as Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I. whose reign began in 1251 and lasted till at least 1261 A.D. Moreover he is recognizedin this inscription as sovereign in AJ). 1269, while we have Majavarman KulaSekhara I.'s accession in June 1268.

The accession of this kingia fixed by Kielhorn between the 2nd and 27th June AJ), 1268. The 3rd year began in A.D. 1270, and the 30th in A,D. 1297. The givendate will fall either in A.D, 1271 or 1298 if correct, As it happens it is equallytrue for either A.D. 1271 or 1298, 
In 1271 the 4th tithi of the first fortnightof ^uni-solar Jyaishtha expired 16 h. 47 m, after mean sunrise on Thursday, the 19th day of solar Vrishabha, which correspondedto Thursday, May 14th, A.D. 1271. On that day the nakshatra Punarvasu. ended bythe equal space system, at 10 h. 41 m. after mean sunrise j by the system of Garga the same ; try the Brahma-siddhanta at 8 h, 39 m., after mean sunrise.

I find therefore that the date of theinscription may be either May 14th, 1271, or May I5th 1298 A.D. It is impossible to say which. The date would be inaccurate for either the 3rd or 30fch year of Maravarman Kulasekhara II.

This date is irregular. The month Vrigchikain the 16th yearof Maravarman Kulasekhara I. falls in October and November 1283. In that month the fifth tithi of luni-solar Karttika fell on Friday, November 26th, the 29th day of solar Vrisohika, and the naltshatras during that day were a large partof Dhanishtha and a smaller part of Satabhishaj. Calculations for 128A A.D. prove equally unsatisfactory, the fifth of the bright lunar fortnightin solar Yrischika ending on Tuesday, November 14th, at 3 h. 7 m. after sunrise, the nakshatra during that period being Sravana byall systems. 
The date is also irregularfor the 16th yearof the reignof Mar.avarnaan Kulasekhara II., in which the fifth titU of the first fortnightof Vrischika ended on Sunday, 26th November 1329 A.D. at 13 h. 58 ra. after sunrise, the nakshatras during that period byall systems being Sravaua and Dhanishtha.

The date is inaccurate for the year 1300 A.D., and correct in all respects for 1301.

This is the latest date yet found of this king. The date is regularfor Monday, oth June, A.D. 1309, and irregularfor A.D. 1307 or 1308.

No. 25.] DATES OF PANDYA KINGS. 143   
"In the [15]th year (of the reign) of king Jatavarman alias the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Sundara-Pandyadeva, on the dayof Pnnarvasu which corresponded to a Monday and to the tenth tithi of the first fortnightof the month of Kumbha in. the (cyclic) year Virodhin,"r 
This date is regular, and belongsto the reignof Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya II., as there was no cyclic year called Virodhin in the reignof Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I, The day in question was Monday, February 20th, A.B. 1290. On that day the tenth tithi of the first fortnight of the ]uni-solar month Phfilguna ended 13 h. 45 m. after mean sunrise. During all that period the iialcshatra was Punarvasu "by both the unequal spaee systems, By the equal space system Punarvasu began1 h, 23 m. after sunrise aud lasted all day. 
It appears that the regnal yearin this inscriptionis illegible, and we cannot therefore argue from it,

"In the 17th year (of the reign) of the glorious Sundara-Pandyadeva, on the day of Pushya, which correspondedto a Wednesday and to the tenth tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Mma in the (cyclic) year Bandana." 
This date must either belong- to the reignof Maravarman Snndara-Pandya I, in whose seventeenth year. 1232-33 A.D. there was a cyclic Nandana; or to that of Jatavarman Simdara Pandya II., in whose seventeenth year, 1292-93 A.D, (if he reigned BO long)there was another Nandana. It could not be the Nandana 1532-33 A.D., in the reignof Maravarman Sundara Paiidya KOnermaikon dan, because that year was onlythe second of the reign; nor could it belong to the reign of auy other known Sundara*Paridya, as in these there was no such cyclic year. 
Examining the date for A.D, 1232-33 I find that it is unsatisfactory. The tenth tithi of the first fortnight of luni-solar Chaitra in that year correspondedto the twenty-eighth dayof solar Mma, which -was Tuesday, March 22, A.D. 1233. The tenth tithi ended at 21 h. S m. after mean sunrise on that day,or at about 3*2 A.M. on the (European) Wednesday,i.e. some hours before the beginningof the Hindu Wednesday, Pushyaended 39 m. after mean etrarise on the Tnesday by the equal space and Garga systems, while by the Bramha-siddhanta the naskliatra was Aslesha throughoutthe tenth tithi. 
The date is fairly regularfor A.D. 1292-93, In that yearthe tenth tithi of the first fortnight of Chaitra began C h. 52 m. after mean sunrise on Wednesday, March 18th, A,D, 1293, -which was the twenty-fourth dayof solar Mlna. The nakshatra by Garga and the equal space system was Pushya till 18 h. 34m. after mean sunrise, and bythe Brahma-siddhiLnta till 16 L, 16 m. after mean sunrise, on that Wednesday.If this was in the seventeenth yearof Jatavarman Sundara Pandya II., it fixes his accession on or later than March 19th A.D. 1276. It will be seen that, if this is the right date, the 10th tithi was connected with the Wednesday thoughat sunrise on that day it was not current3 and this is unusual. Considering that this inscriptionis onlyfour days later than No. 77 next following, which is regularin all respects, and that it belongsto the same place and temple, it is safe to assume that the tenth tithi was wrongly quotedfor the ninth.

{C In the (cyclic) year Kandana, which was the 17th year (of the reign) of kingJata varman alias the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Sundara-Pandyadeva, on the day of Bdhinf, which correspondedto a Saturday and to the fifth tithi of the first fortnight of the month of Mina," 
As in the last case, this year nmst be either 1232-33 or 1292-93 A,D. For ihe first it is irregular, for though ttaenakshatra is correct, the 5th titlii in qnestionfell ihat year on a Thursday, For the second, the date is perfectly regular. In A,D. 1292-93 the 5th tithi of the first fortnight of luni-solar Chaitra fell on Saturday,the 20th dayof solar Ifina, which corres ponded with March Uth, A.D, 1293, This 5th titU ended 14 h. 18 m. after sunrise. The nabshatra was R5hin! throughoutthe tithi by all the systems, 
The corresponding date is therefore Saturday, March 14, 1293 A.D.t and the inscription belongs to the reign of Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya II. It was four daysearlier than the last inscription, It fixes the king's accession on or after March 15, A.D. 1276.

This date is irregular, for the reignof either of the two known Jatavarman Sundara Pandyas. I have tried the years 1256, 1257, 1258, 1281, 1282, 1283, which might possibly coincide with, or approximate to, the 7th regnatyearof either of those kings, without success, Some element of the inscription appearsto be wrong,either in the original or in the copy.3 
The exact date of Jatavarman Simdara-Pandya II. 's accession is still doubtful, and mnsfc for the present remain so. The following analysis, however, may be found useful, To the list published by Kielhorn in Vol. IX. p. 228 of dates previously examined I now add four more, vwf.Nos. 74, 75, 76, 77, above. The tested dates of J. Sundara II, are now fourteen in number. 
Of these K. 26* must be discarded. The wordingof the date is"intrinsically wrong," K. 53 is doubtful because the regnal yearis not clear in the injured original. It appearsto be either"llth" or"10th." Working fora possible 19th year, Professor Kielhora found tbe date regular for November 10th, A.l>, 1294, buf-is "not fully convinced"that this conclusion is correct. I find myself equally unconvinced, because thafc date seems too late for this Mug

No 25 ]DATES OF PANDYA KINGS, 145   
Wassnf and Rashid-ud-Jin 'assert that"Sundar Pandi"died in Hijra 692, the l&st dayof which yeai- was December 1st, A.D. 1293 (Yule's Marco Polo, II. 269j.I see no Teal reason why we should not accept the date as beingone of the llth year,ot'u. October 29th, A.D. 1287, and if so it supports the evidence offered bythe second of the two groups given below;but it is perhaps safer to reject the date as a basis for argument. K. 55 is also doubtful since it would seem that if correct in other respects, a wrongsolar month was quoted, and K. 56 must be set aside because it is evident that the regnal year has been wrongly quoted j the date given in A.D. 1286 as the ninth yearis at variance with all the other dates yet examined, and would postpone the king's accession to a date subsequentto March 29th, A.D. 1277. I also discard roy No, 75 (above) for the reason givenin my note on that inscription. This leaves nine dates by which we may be guided,if No. 76 is acceptedas I think it certainly may be. 
Of these nine, K. 25, K. 27, K. 52, K, 54, put together, giveas August 28th, A.D. 1275 to May 15th, A.D. 1276 as the limit;and E. 23, K. 24, and my 74, 76, 77 give us October 1st A.D. 1276 to March 14th, A.D. 1277, as the limit of the accession of this king. 
With regard to overlappingo reigns, e.g. AugustA.D. ! 289 beingin the 13th or Uth year of this king (K. 23, 24) when Jane 27, A.D, 1289, is placedalso in the 22nd yearof Maravarman Kulasekhara I. (K. 48)it is well to note that Marco Polo (Jule, II, 267) saya "In this province (Maabar)there are five kings who are own brothers. ... at this end of the province reigns one of those five Eoyal Brothers, who is a crowned King, and his name is BONDER BAHDI DAVAB." Wassaf, speakingof the same king under the name"DEWAR SUNDAR PANDI" says he had "three brothers, each of whom established himself in independence in some different country" (find. 269). This acobunt ia strongly supported bythe Chinese annals (ibid. 273), where the countryis called "Maparh,"or Malabar, and is reportedto have Bent tribute (presents)to Kublai Khan in A.D. 1286."Pauthier has given some very curious and novel extracts from Chinese so arcea regarding the diplomaticintercourse with Ma'bar in 1280 and the following years. Among other pointsthese mention 'the five brothers who were Sultans.'"See also my remarks in the last paragraphof No. 69 above. 
Colonel Yule's note from which I have quoted gives us some further important informa tion regarding the kingdom (or kingdoms)of Madura at this period, Waseaf introduces '13 10) a king whom he calls"Kales Dewar" who had ruled for 40 years, and whom we may identify with Majavarman Kulasekhara, I. in whose 40th year, vis. March 18fch 1303 A.D., was engraved the inscriptionat Tiruvarur (above VIII. p. 276), and in his 41st year, m. June 9th, A.D. 1309, the inscription at Sianainaattr (No. 73 of the present publication).1 
He had two sons, Snndar Bandi bya lawful wife, and Pirabandi (Yira Pandi ?) illegitimate. He designated the latter as bis successor. Sundar Bandi, enragedat this, slew his father" and seized the throne. Vira-Pandyadrove him out, and Sundara-Pandya sought aid from the 
Muhammadans, which led to Malik Kafur's raid. The storyis confirmed by Amir Klinsrn. It must be remembered that this Sundara-Pandya, who murdered his father KulaSe khara I., was not our Jatavarman Sundara-PandyaII. who seems to have died in A.D. 1293, but a sabsequcnt prince of the same name and family. We have as yefc no published inscrip* tions bearing date between 1309 and 1317 A.D. in the Pandya territories. If any of the parricide Sundara-Pandyas come to light we shall have to call that king (or prince) Sundara Pandya III. 
i This was tie KulaSekhara to whom the Tamils- entrusted the tooth relic carried away by them from Cevlon (ttakfivansa, eh. XO, verse 43).It was returned a few yearalater, The Makamnsa also mentions ttiefivo'oHhren who governedthe Pandyan kingdom" in tie reign of Bhuvaneka Bahu of Ceylon whose date Bell gives as 1277-1288 A.D.

The reign of Maravarman Kulasekhara II, began accordingto Kielhorn (above, Vol. VIII, p. 228) between March 6th and March 29th, A.D. 1314 Work for Tula in his 8th year proves that the 2nd solar day of that month was Wednesday, September 30, 1321 A.D. On tbat day, the 9th titlii of the bright fortnight of the Inni- solar month Asvina was current for 17 h. 
13 m. after mean sunrise, while the nakshatra Sravana was current by the equal- space and Garga systems for 23 h. 48 m. after mean sutfrise, and by the Brahma-Sid dhanta for the whole day except for 1 h. 15 m. after mean sunrise during which period Abhijit was current. This if) probably the correct date. 
The date is irregular for the Sth year of Maravarraan Kulasekhara I. in respectof the week-day. The month of Tula in this king's Sth yearfell in A.D. 1275. On Monday, Septem ber 30, A.D. 1275, which was the 2nd day of solar Tula,the 9th titU of the bright fortnightof luni-solar Asvina expired2 h. 37 m. aftet mean sunrise;the naksliatra, being Sravana by the equal apace system and by Garga for 10 h. 13 m., and bythe Brahma- Siddhanta fox 11 h. 40 m. after mean sunrise. If, therefore, the week-day quoted had beea Monday instead of Wednesday, the date would have been perfectly regular.It is worthy of note that the epithet" who was pleased to take every country"is applied onlyto Jatavarrnan Sundara-PandyaI. and .JMaravar man Kulasekhara I. Whichever king this may belong to, the initial date of his reign remains unaffected,

"In tlie 8th year (o/the reign'] of king Maravarmau alias the emperor of the to a Tuesday, to the ..... [tithi] of the second fortnight and to the llth 
three worlds, the glorious Kulasekharadeva, on the day of Svati, which, corresponded 
solar day of the month of Dhanus." 
This date is incorrect when worked for 1275 or 1276 A.D., the 8th year of Mar.avarman Kulasekhara L; and it is also incorrect for A.D. 1321, the 8th yearof Majavarmaa Knlase khara II. In A.D. 1275 the llth Dhanus wag a Saturday. In A.D. 1276 it was a Snnday. In A.D. 1321 it corresponded with Monday, December 7th. In each case the corresponding tithi belongs to the dark fortnight, bat the nakshatras were respectively Pushya, Jyeshtha and Punarvasn. As to the last (1321)Professor Kielhorn's No. 28 (above, Vol. VI. pp. 312-13) may be compared with it. I have provedits correctness. That date, which -was in the 8th yearof Mr.avarman Kulasgkhara II., corresponded with 14th November A.D. 1321 which was 23 daysearlier than December 7th. The ndkshatra, was Utta-ra-Phalguni, and it is plain that on a day23 dayslater the nakshatra could not possiblybt? Svati.1 The date wonld be correct in all respectsfor the 18th solar dayof Dhanus, Tuesday, December 15, A.D. 1321, when, at mean sunrise, the nakuhatra was Svati and when the 10th iitlii of the dark fortnight was current. 
No. 26. DANAVULAPADU PILLAR INSCRIPTION OF SRIVIJAYA. BY H. KRISHNA SABTBI, B.A. 
The subjoined record3 is engraved on the three faces of one of the Jaina pillars, discovered by the Superintendent, Archeaological Survey, Madras, at Danavulapadu (in the Jammalmadugu taluka of the Ouddapah District)in 1903, when he made extensive excavations there, on the Bandy bank of the river Pennar. The results of Mr. Rea's excavations are publishedin the Director General's Annual Reportfor 1905-6, pp. 120 to 127> which include a complete descrip tion with a half-tone picture (fig. 7) of the sculpturesin three panels on one of the broad faces of the pillar (p. 124) and an English translation of the inscription on two of its narrow faces (p. 1241) 
By 'way of supplementing wbat has been alreadystated byMr. Eea, I append, with the kind permission of the editor, a full text of the record, which is not givenin the Annual and the translation of a portionof the inscription, which is also omitted there, bysome mistake.2 
1 Since writing the above Mr. Venkayya has informed me thib the quoted day of the solar month Dhamis may be, act "11" but" 19." On this basis I have again examined the date. It is not correct for the reign of M. Kulasekhara I. For A.D. 182 L the eighth yearof M. Kolasekliara II,, the details would be correct for the 18tb, i>ut not for the 19th Dhanus. At mean sunrise on Tuesday, Decomb&r 15, A.D. 1321, which was the 18th day of DhamiB, the tenth tithi of the second fortnight expired 3h, 16 to. after,mean dunrise ; the nakshatra being at mean sunrise, Svati by the equal space system.It ended Q h. 18 m. later by that system. But by Garga it liad ended 5 h. 54 m,, and by the Brnhma-Siddhantft 10 h. 2 m. before mean sunrise, Visakha being current at that moment, On the 19th Dhanus Visakha was current byall systems. I think the date is probably genuine, but that the 19th of the solar month was quotedin error for the 18th.

s The portion omitted in the Annual is the u third face"(11. 44 to 67) of the pillar, On p, 125, however, Mr. e< The second reads .,,,,. prosperity," and connects it with tbo subjoined pillar record 
Bca adds in continuation the translation of a later inscription of the 14th century A,D. in the passage ooinnwnewg ; 
which is at least 4 centuries earlier. It may be noted that the later record translated by Mr. Hea, was also dis covered in the same locality (No, 336 of the Madras Epigraphicalcollection for 1905).
148 EPIGRAPHIA INDICA. [Voi, X.   
The ink-impressions from which the accompanying plate has been prepared, were taken under my direct supervision from the original pillar \vhich is now preservedin the Madras Museum, along -with the other antiquitiesof Danavulapadu. 
The record is not dated. Bat the Kanarese characters in which it is written may be referred to the period between the 10th and llth centuries A.D. The alphabet bears a strong resemblance in certain details (e.g. in the distinction made between long and sbort i and in tko adding of the replia to a consonant endingin i) to that of the two Nolamba records from Dharmapuri published by me,1 hut is exactlysimilar in many respectsto those of the Atakiir inscription of the time of Krishna III.2 and of the epitaphof Ma-rasimha II.3 of the 10th century A.D, The aymbolfor long n affixed to the consonant m is different in form from that used in other cases; compare e.g. mu of ripusamuhain 1. 21 and of murti in 1. 32, with nti of *ajiuiia.- in 1. 51 and Win of bha-mandaladol in 1. 64. The final forms of in(11. 22 and 48), n (1. 39) and I (11. 50 and 52), the cursive form of the consonant feft (1, 52) and the usa of the Dravidian I (11. 8, 24, 50, 52) and r (11. 12, 48, 49 twice, 56, 62) may also be speciallynoted. The record consists of 11 verses of which vv. 3, 5 and 6 are in the Sanskrit language (the first being in the Sahkirnaka(?)4 and the second two, in the Arya-giti metre) and the rest in Kanarese (in the Kanda metre). Lines 65 to 67 are in Kanarese prose, while the invocatory and benedic tory phrases (11, 44 and 48) are in Sanskrit. 
The order in which the three written faces of the epigraph have to be read presents sorae difficulty. The broader face which begins with a benedictoryclause and ends with the writer's name, must be taken to be a completerecord byitself. The two narrow faces which contain the eulogy of Srivijaya do not begin with any auspicious word, phraseor verse, but end with the usual mamgala-niaha-srik. Apparently,the inscription was meant to be divided into two 
parts, the first of which, comprisingthe two narrow faces of the pillar, began with a description of the military prowess of the dandanay oka Srivijaya,to whom in the bodyof the record are applied the surnames Arivingoja (v. 7), Anupamakavi (vv. 2, 4, 9 and 1. 65 f.) and perhaps also Sarvavikramatunga (v, 10). Of the three Sanskrit verses included In this portion 
of the record, two (w. 5 and 6) are addressed to Srivijaya and expressthe wish that lie might live long to rule the circle of the earth under orders of king Indra. The third verse while describing his prowess in highly poetical language, incidentally mentions Baji-kula, the family 
to which Srivijaya belongedand the king Narendra of whom he was the general (dandadlii pati). The second partof the inscription, evidentlythe more important of the two, is written on one o the broad faces of the pillar and opens with an invocatoryclause which pro claims glory to the prosperous doctrine of the Jina. The first three verses (7 to 9) on this face appear to suggest that Srivijaya voluntarily resigned this world and took samnyasa in order to attain eternal bliss. The nest two verses are againin praiseof Srivijaya's military prowess, 
1 Above, pp. 54 to 70 and Plate.2 Ibid. Vol. VI. pp, 50 to 57 and Plate. 3 Ibid. Vol. V. pp. 151 to 180 and Plate. 
*According to Gaiigadaea'a Chhandomaftjarl (Cli. V. IB) Giti is a verse whose second half corresponds to the first half of an. iryi (i.e. contains 30 mafoas), the first half presumably beingthe same as that of the Aryi Arya-Giti, again, on the same authority (Hid. 21)lias both its halves corresponding to the first half of an Arya with an additional ywfw (is. contains 32 tndtrds). The metre, however, of the verse under consideration, whose scheme ia 82 matrds in the first half and 30 in the second, is neither Giti nor Arya-Giti as described by Gangadasa, It pro bably corresponds to the Sanklrnaka mentioned in Dr. Kittel's edition of Nagavarina's Chhandas (Ch. IV. 292). Dr. Kittel interprets the scheme of the metre as 32 and 27 (Cbkandas, p. 93). Nagavarma's definition may admit of an. explanation which yields 32 and 30 for the scheme of the Sanklrnaka and thus correspond to that of v. 3 of the subjoined inscription, Nagavsrma'a v. 292 may be translated thus : "If the fast half (a-apar-ardha ?) of an Arya (i.e> of 30 matras) unites with the first half of a Kanda in the order mentioned (i.e. 82, in the first and 30 in the second), then 0! lotus-faced one! the metre becomes the Sankirnaka as stated by Kavirajahamaa (t.e. Niga varma).JI

and 11. 65 to 67 state that the writer of the record was Gunavarma, the clerk (senabova~) of Anupamakavi. 
It thus appears from an examination of the contents that the only name in the record jvhich may be of historical interest is that of kingIndra (or Naiendra) whose subordinate was the dandanayaka Srivijaya. Aud, to judge from the characters, king Indra will have to be identified with the Bashtrakiita TTityavarsha-Indra III, for whom we have the dates A.D. 915 and 916-7, or with Indra IV., the grandaoa of Krishna III., who died in A.D. 9S2.1 Before attempting to decide which of the two kingscould be intended here,it may be useful to mention the existence of a record of the Rashtrakuta king Wityavarsha in the Jaina ruins of Danavulapadu, quite close to where the subjoined pillar was dug up.3 It is engraved round the rim of a stone pedestal aud consists of a single Sanskrit verse which has been translated on p. 121 f. of the Director General's Annual for 1905-6. Here, again,it is doubtful if Nityavai-sha is identical with Indra III. or Khottiga, both of whom bore that surname. As, however, the pedestal record and the subjoined pillar inscription are found in the same ruins and the characters, except for the flourishes used in the former, are almost of the same type, there is a strong presumption in favour of identifying Nityavarsha of the pedestal record with king Indra of the Srivijaya inscription and of assigning both the epigraphsto the time of Nitya varaha Indra III., i.e. to the beginningof the 10th century A.D. In supportof this identifica tion it may be stated that in verse 3 of the subjoined record, Srivijaya is stated to have been the commander of the forces of Narendra. The context requires us here, to interpret narendra not as a general synonym for' king,' but as a proper name. Dr. Eleet in dealing with the appellations of the Easbtrakuta kings,3 has drawn attention to the honorific Narendradeva with which the surname Nityavarshaof ludra III. occurs combined, in the Kausarl grants. Although the word narendra, (or ncur&ndradeva) may admit of the translation' His Majesty}as Dr. Fleet has taken it, still in the lightof what has been stated above, it appearsto me that Narendra must be taken, at least in the subjoined record, as a hitherto unknown surname of Indra III. 
Dandan&yaba Srivijaya is not mentioned in any published inscriptions. His identification, if satisfactorily made out, would be of much interest to students of Kanarese literature; for, his surnames Arivingsja41 and Anupamakavi5have, apparently, a special reference to his literary acquirements ;while Sarvavikramatuiigaindicates his military prowess.6 Two per sons of literary fame both bearingthe name Srivijayaare known to Kanarese literature. The colophon at the end of each of the three chaptersof the Kavirajatnargndescribes that work as having "been the productionof Srivijaya on the lines laid down by king Nripatunga. This king who is also called Atisayadhavala and Amoghavarsha in the body of the work, has been identified with the Bashtrakuta Amoghavarsha I. (A.D.814-5 to 877-8).If the Kavir&ja m&rga was actually written by Srivijaya, who is stated to have been the court poetof Nri patunga aud to have borne the surname Kavisvara, his time would fall into the beginning of the ninth century A.D. Another Srivijayais referred to in the body of the same work (Kavir&j&murga) as an earlier author whose writings were looked upon as the standard type of

* The word literally means' the teacher of knowledge,* A similar title in Kannada literature ia Negaltegoja assumed by Nagavarma the author o the Chhandat ; see the Karnataha-Zavioharite by Messrs. R. Narasiraha char, M.A., M.E.A.S., and S. G. Narasimhachar,Vol. I. pp. 46 and 50.

Knaarese poetry at the time of Nripatuoga. Thesu two Srivijayas who "belong, one to the 9th century A.D. and the other to some still earlier period, cannot in any way be connected jvith the dindcwayaka Siivijayaof the Danavulapadn record whose time, as stated already, could Lave beett only about the beginningof the tenth century A.D. 
further, we know of a fourth Srivijaya mentioned in the Sravana-Belgola epitaphof Mallishana.1 He was one of the Jaina teachers of great learning who succeeded Hemasena and a contemporary of an unspecified Ganga king. An inscription dated Saka 999 (=A.D. 1077-78) at Riimoha in the Shimoga District,3apparentlyrefers to Satyavakya Rakkasa-Ganga, a brother's son of JSTolamlbakulantaka Marasimha II. and to his contemporary,the Jaina teacher Srlvijaya, It is not unlikely that this Eakkasa-Ganga is the unspecified Ganga king mentioned above and is identical with the Rakkaaa referred to in Nos. 133 and 13-i of Professor Kielhorn's List of Southern Inscriptions. Consequently,the time of the Jaina teacher Srivijaya whose disciple Bakkasa-Ganga was, may be placed roughly between Saka 899 (= A.D. 977), the date of the Pegga-ur inscription of Raehamalla II and Saka 999 (=A.D. 1077-78),the date o the Humcha record. But there la nothingto show that the Jaina teacher Srlvijayaof the Mallishena epitaph was nrst a layman 'in the military service of the Rashtrakuta kingIndra III., and that he subsequently joinedthe order of ascetics. Consequently,the Srivijayaof the Dana vdapadu record, is perhapsalso different from the Jaina teacher Srivijaya, though possibly he was contemporaneous with him, and flourished in the tenth century A.D. 
It may be remarked, finally, that, like the famous Ganga general Chamundaraja or Chavtmdaraya who served the Western Ganga sovereigns Marasimha II. and Raehamalla H and largely patronised Jaina literature and religion, the dandandyaka Srlvijaya was unsurpassed in the military art as ia the literary, patronised Jainism and resigned the world in the end} as .a pious Jaina, in order to seek salvation, The pictureofajrider on Jiorsebaokfollowed byan umbrella bearer J^icji.^ depictedin the lowest panel on one of the foar faces of the pillaris perhaps meant to representthe general Srivijaya marching againsthis enemy on the battle field. It must also be noted that the demi-god Brahma-yaksha in Jaina iconography is figured as riding on a horse.3 
Bajikula/' the familyto which Srivijaya belonged, and Gunavarma5 the clerk (senaldva) who wrote (i.e. composed ?) the text of the record, I am unable to identify.

APPENDIX,   
A LIST OF 
BEAHMI INSCRIPTIONS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES TOABOUT A.D, 400 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE OF AS6KA. 
BY PBOFESSOR H, LUDESS; BosrocE, 
The following list of early Brahnri inscriptionslias been preparedas a supplement to the excellent lists of inscriptionsof Northern and Southern India publisl ed bythe late Professor Kielhorn. It is intended to giveall Brahmi inscriptions from the earliest times to about the end of the fourth century A.D. found in the periodicals and Government publications accessible to me, 
with the exception of the As"0ka inscriptions, the "bibliography of which would require a different form. I have included also a few inscriptions which, though probably beingof a somewhat later date, in form and tenor agree with the earlier inscriptions, But I have as a rule excluded such inscriptions as appear in Professor Kielhorn's lists, even if they show the characteristic features of the earlier inscriptions and in a definite collection therefore would probably have to be classed with them. I bave excluded on purposealso all seal inscriptions, 
The principles accordingto which the list has been compiled are the same as those adopted by Professor Kielhorn, with one exception. When an inscription has been edited several times, Professor Kielhorn generallystates only where it has been publishedlast. In the case of the earlier inscriptions, the reading and interpretationof which is often much disputed,it appearedto me impracticable to follow that course, and I have OE this account endeavoured to give a complete bibliography of every inscription. Of mere references, however, I have quoted only such as bear on the reading or interpretationof the text 'of the records. It would have been useless to notice all passages where an inscription has been made use of for generalhistorical purposes. In the statements of the contents of the inscriptions I have quoted every proper name mentioned in tne text, in the case of Prakrit names adding,if possible, the Sanskrit equivalent, and I have given also the original term for all words denoting a vocation, profession, etc., as a perfectly accurate translation of these terms is often difficult or even impossible. In accordance with Professor Kielhorn's lists I have also tried to indicate where an inscriptionis at the present tune. For a few references I am indebted to the list of Brahmi inscriptions given byProfessor O. Ifaanke in his work Pali und Sanskrit, pp. 10 and ff. 
The arrangement of the inscriptionsis made from a geographical pointof view. As the greater part of the inscriptions are private records and not dated, any other arrangementis hardly practicable. 
A look at the bibliographyof these inscriptionswill show how much labour haa already been spent on them, and yetit cannot be denied that much etill remains to be done. The band of real scholars that have worked at them has been comparativelyemail. To a great extent this is undoubtedly due to the difficulty of takingin at a glancethe widelyscattered materials. If in spite of its imperfections, which are well known to me,the presentlists should contribute towards the removing of this obstacle, I shall deem to have accomplished my object.EPIGRAPEIA INDICA.
