<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-2">Introduction</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Shri Jayadayalji Goyandka, the writer of the spiritual essays, stands in little need of any introduction to our readers. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A true light on the path of God-realization can be shed only by a person, who has himself realized God, who has known Him, who lives in Him and through whom God manifests His will. Shri Jayadayalji was indeed a realized soul, obviously his ideas on the technique of realizing God must be most dependable, most illuminating and real gems of Godly wisdom.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We are full of joy to present this small volume in the hands of those who are keen to know God and are true aspirants and seekers of Truth as an unfailing guide, a comforting companion and an affectionate friend on their journey towards Godhead.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">We are sure that devotees would derive definite aid and illumination from this volume.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-3">The Secret of the Atmā and the Paramātmā</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span>Q.—Are </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Atmā</span><span> and </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span><span> one and the same, or is there any difference between the two ?</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A.—This question covers the highest truth and the greatest secret. Truly speaking, it is extremely difficult to say anything categorial on this matter. Nevertheless, all the Teachers of religion have expressed their views on it, following the teachings of their respective sects. According to the schools that uphold Bhakti or Devotion, the Jīva is different from the Paramātmā, that is, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> can never be the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span>, and the Jīva can never be the Paramātmā. Though one in kind, they are different in form. According to the teachings of <span class="char-style-override-10">Adwaita</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> are identical. Like space within a pot and space outside it, though appearing different on account of the Jīva’s identification with the body, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> are, in reality, one and the same. The Lord described the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> as a portion of Him—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ममैवांशो जीवलोके जीवभूत: सनातन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मन:षष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XV. 7)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> (soul) in the body is an eternal portion of Myself; it draws with it the mind and the five senses that rest in Matter.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswāmī śrī Tulasīdāsajī also says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“God’s part, the Jīva (<span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span>) is imperishable sentient, stainless and by nature delight itself.”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* ईस्वर अंस जीव अबिनासी।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">चेतन अमल सहज सुखरासी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as the various <span class="char-style-override-10">cāryas</span> hold their own individual views in respect of the Jīvātmā, even so their views on God also differ from one another. But the actual truth about the matter can never be understood unless the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> has directly realized God. The views of all these Teachers are both reasonable and approved by the scriptures. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> also uphold these contradictory views. Some of their statements stand for Dualism<span class="char-style-override-11">1</span>, and the others for Identity.<span class="char-style-override-11">2 </span>Similarly the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> also describes the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">ºśwara</span> sometimes as Dual (Cf. verses XV. 7 and XVIII.61) and sometimes Identical (Cf. verses XIII. 30 and XVIII.20). All these are included in the two paths of discipline enunciated by the Lord in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">लोकेऽस्मिन् द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O sinless Arjuna! In this world two courses of spiritual discipline have been enunciated by Me in the past. In the case of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span> proceeds along the path of knowledge, whereas in the case of the Karmayogī, it proceeds along the path of Action.”</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">1. The<span class="char-style-override-10"> Muṇḍakopaniṣad </span>says—</p>

<p class="Footnotes-English">2. The<span class="char-style-override-10"> ºśāvāsyopaniṣad </span>says—</p>

<p class="Footnotes-English">“Whoever beholds all beings in the soul alone, and the soul in all beings, that is, regards all beings as his own soul—does not look down on any creature. How can he really look down on others regarding them as his own soul?”</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">“Thus when to the saint, the knower of the Self, all beings appear as the soul; in other words, when he beholds the unity of the soul, then there is no delusion, no grief for him. That is, modifications like grief, delusion, etc., wholly cease in the case of one who realizes the presence of the same Supreme Brahma, God, the embodiment of knowledge and bliss in all.”</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">In the second <span class="char-style-override-10">Mantra</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Māṇḍūkyopaniṣad</span> says—</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">सर्वॸ ह्येतद् ब<span>्र</span> ब्रह्मायमात्मा ब्रह्म सोऽयमात्मा चतुष्पात्।</p>

<p class="Footnotes-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Chāndogyopaniṣad</span> also says—</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानिति शान्त उपासीत।<span class="char-style-override-13"></span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-English">“All this verily is Brahma, for therefrom doth it proceed, therein doth it merge, and thereby is it maintained; realizing this with a quiet and controlled mind one should practise adoration.”</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Right-English" xml:lang="en-GB">(VI. ii. 1)</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">“O child ! In the beginning there was only this Sat, without a second.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In other words, one path upholds Dualism or Separateness and the other Unity or Identity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Worship through separateness is called the path of  devotion; in this path, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> is regarded as the worshipper, and God as the object of worship. In this path, again, there are many divisions and sub-divisions. <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> belonging to the various schools worship God either as śrī Rāma, or as śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, or śrī śiva, or śrī Viṣṇu, etc. All these <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> regard their respective object of worship as the Supreme Lord Himself and attribute all the marks of God in Him and hold Him to be the agent of creation, sustenance and destruction of the universe. Just as people call water by different names, e.g., Nīra,  p, Toya, Ambu, Pānī, etc., even so śrī Rāma, śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, śrī Viṣṇu, śrī śiva, śrī Durgā, śrī Gaṇeśa, śrī Sūrya, śrī Hari, Parameśwara, Allāh, Khudā, etc., stand for the name of one and the same God. The substance is one; though men belonging to the different sects worship Him by different names. This is how the worshippers of different schools worship the different forms of God. Some worship God with form, and others the formless aspect of God. Some worship God as possessed of two hands, some as possessed of four hands; and some others, as possessed of many hands. Some worship Him considering Him to be masculine in gender, some look upon God as feminine; and there are others who adore the Absolute in the neuter gender. All worship their respective forms of God according to their own faith and belief; but whatever descriptions of God are given by these worshippers, when they are all combined, cannot describe even a part of the real form of God. Truly speaking, it is never possible for anyone to give a full description of the complete form of God; for He is indescribable. Without direct realization, none can even know the real form of God. He can be understood only after realization. He is not the object of mind and speech—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यतो वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-10">Taittirīya</span>. II. ix. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For instance, there are <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> who adore <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhagavān</span> śrī Kr̥ṣṇa as the object of their worship; but these <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> also adopt different forms of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa for their respective practices. Some meditate on the Child, or Gopāla Form of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa aged three years, and some on śrī Kr̥ṣṇa of eleven years, the player of the divine flute; and there is a third group, who meditate on śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the Charioteer of Arjuna. All these three classes of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> meditate on three different forms of one and the same śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. In this also, there are many minor divisions and sub-divisions. For example, imagine there are a thousand <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span>, who meditate on śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, the divine flute-player, of eleven years of age. If all these <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas </span>are painters themselves, and each of them is asked to make a pictorial representation of his Deity, the pictures they will produce will be different in every case; that is, they will paint one-thousand different forms of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, for all of them worship the Lord according to their own respective ideas about Him. That is the reason why the picture produced by one <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> will be different from that of the other. No <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> can truly know the real form of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa until he has directly seen the Lord. Similarly, the sentiment of devotion cultivated by devotees towards the Lord are also many. Some worship Him through the Servant-sentiment, and some through the Parental sentiment, some through the Friendly and some others through the Sweet sentiment. Mother Yaśodā cultivated the motherly sentiment towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, śrī Hanumān worshipped śrī Rāma through the Servant-sentiment, and Sugrīva through the Friendly-sentiment. The sentiments of śrī Sītājī towards śrī Rāma and of śrī Rukmiṇījī towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa are of the sweet type. Dualistic worship is thus performed by devotees following various moods and sentiments.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such differences should be understood to be present even in the case of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> who worship the attributeless and formless aspect of God. In this Path, the Jīvātmā and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā </span>appear, separate when the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> is passing through the stage of practice; but in reality there is no difference. Like space within the pot and infinite space, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> appear separate due to the existence of the body; but in reality they are one and the same. This form of worship, based on the idea of Identity, is called worship according to the Path of Identity. In this also, there are several divisions and sub-divisions according to the sentiment or mental outlook of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>. The utterance of a single word “Saccidānanda” gives rise to different idea in the minds of different <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span>. The idea produced in one mind will not agree into with that of another. But whatever idea or form is produced by the word in the mind of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, he makes that his spiritual goal and goes on meditating thereon for the attainment of perfection, as the result of which he succeeds in realizing God; but, when logically considered, the picture of the goal formed by a Sādhaka in his mind can never be treated as real. But from the point of view of practice all such mental pictures are real; for they lead ultimately to the realization of God. The reality about God is known by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka </span>only when through the attainment of perfection in his practice he actually realizes God. In Dualistic Worship also, the reality about the Divine cannot be known and understood, until the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> has actually seen God face to face.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For the removal of this anomaly we may submit to God that He should either reveal to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> His true form in the very beginning, and tell the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> that the latter would realize Him after the practice of meditation on that form for so many years; or He should send a true copy of His photograph so that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> may know what His actual form is, or impart to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka </span>by some other means the Knowledge of His actual form. Unless this is done, whatever form the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> may meditate upon believing it to be the form of God should be regarded by the Lord as His own true form. As a matter of fact, God easily grants whatever the devotee may think about Him; according to this argument a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> may practise meditation on any form in the name of God, and may thereby realize God; for the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> has no other way but to follow the guidance of religious Teachers and the scriptures for the practice of meditation. Therefore, cultivating faith in the scriptures, one should go on with his spiritual practice according to them. In reality, God’s true form is altogether different in kind from whatever conceptions of God we may form in our mind based on the idea of identity or dualism, form or formlessness, attributes or attributelessness—after reading the scriptures, or hearing from the lips of saints, or on a study of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. Without direct realization, it is absolutely impossible for us to understand the real nature and form of God in our<span class="char-style-override-10"> Sādhaka</span> state by any means whatsoever. But what is the remedy? That is why the Lord says that everyone practising meditation on any of His aspects—Manifest or Unmanifest, dual or non-dual, with or without attributes, with or without form will certainly realize Him according to the sentiment he cultivates. This is clearly implied by the statement <span class="char-style-override-8">“</span><span class="char-style-override-14">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्</span><span class="char-style-override-8">”</span> (“Howsoever men approach Me, even so do I seek them”—<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> IV. II).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sum and substance of what has been stated above is this; according to the principle of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti</span> the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> (individual soul) is a part and God is the Total or Whole. Thus though one kind and essence they are separate. According to the principle of Identity or Unity, the <span class="char-style-override-10">tmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> are one and the same; they appear separate due to nothing but error, in reality they are one. What the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> believes in should be regarded by him as principle or established truth; for a practitioner cannot reach a high state of development unless a belief is given the position of a principle. In reality, all the principles adopted by <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> during the period of practice are nothing but concepts or ideas; the real principle or real substance is one and the same, which is beyond mind and speech and can be experienced only after God-realization. There is no other way of comprehending that reality. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> first realizes God according to the principle he adopts for his practice, dual or non-dual. After this first realization, he gains knowledge of the real truth and real form of God, which is called <span class="char-style-override-10">Amr̥ta</span> or ambrosia. This is beyond speech, mind and the intellect. The concept formed by the intellect, which derives its power from God, is only an intellectual conception about the form of God; the senses and mind cannot dive deep into and sound the depth of that reality. One can never obtain a reflection of the entire firmament in a mirror; for the firmament is infinite and the mirror is a small thing. Even so, God is infinite and the intellect is a small thing, hence the reality about God can never be comprehended by the intellect.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Teachers of Devotion like śrī Rāmānujācārya, śrī Madhwācārya, śrī Nimbārkācārya and śrī Vallabhācārya, etc., preached methods and practices of Bhakti which in their detail show differences from one another, either in more or less degree. But all of them gave allegiance to the principle that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā </span>are separate. Similarly, Teachers of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Adwaita </span>school like śaṅkarācārya, also, though showing differences of opinion about the kind of unity between the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span>, uphold the principle of Identity. In reality, both the principles of dualism and identity are true. For <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span>, who are inclined towards Devotion, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvātmā</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> are separate; and for <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> who are inclined towards Identity, they are one and the same. Though these two are two distinct paths of practice, their fruit is one. God is both above Dualism and Identity, and possesses also those characteristics. Hence both the paths are right. Here, the question arises—what, then, is the real truth? The answer is that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka </span>will come to know the real truth only after direct realization of God, for actually it is something above and beyond both separateness and identity. It is a state which cannot be comprehended by the mind or explained by speech. Therefore, the best thing for the Sādhaka is to make his choice between these two paths according to his inclination and taste, and devote himself to the practices of his chosen path, for therein lies his spiritual good. Both the paths are approved by the scriptures and are supported by reason, and both lead to God-realization. After the realization of God, the actual truth and reality about the matter will be automatically comprehended by him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For this supernatural, extraordinary and indescribable truth can never be completely described by the scriptures and saints. What they describe is concerned primarily with discipline, which infallibly leads to God-realization. But the spiritual goal to which they take the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas </span>is beyond both mind and speech; it can only be experienced and is comprehended only after the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> has actually realized God. The scriptures and saints recognize both the paths of discipline and describe both as highly efficacious. The teachings of all religious sects are worthy of our respect and what they preach are all true, according to the rule of logic known as the “branch and the moon.” When as the result of the practice of these disciplines God is actually realized, there comes an experience, which is supernatural and extraordinary. This is the reality in its true sense. The teachings of the scriptures and saints are true in the sense that <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> following the paths shown by them succeed in realizing God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now, we shall explain what constitutes the logic of ‘branch and the moon’. Suppose the moon has risen on the second day of the lunar fortnight; and one person has seen it and another cannot discover it with all his effort. Now, the person who has seen that faint curved line of the moon, pointing his finger to the branch of a tree, says—“Look, a cubit above that branch is the moon.” Turning his gaze according to the direction indicated, the second person succeeds in seeing the moon. But was the moon, really speaking, a cubit above that branch? Never. Similarly, the same person guides another friend by saying, “Look, the moon is close to that corner of this house.” And following his guidance, the second friend also succeeds in seeing the moon. But was the moon actually close to the corner of that house? Never. Even so he guides a third person saying, “Look, the moon is between the two paws of that flying bird”, and following that direction looking towards the paws of the bird the person sees the moon. But was the moon actually between the paws of that bird? Never. We should learn from this that though the literal senses of the words used are wrong, they lead to the attainment of the objective. Even so, though the disciplines laid down by the scriptures and saints may appear defective when tested by reason, they are all true, because, finally, they lead to God-realization. Just as following the direction of a guide and turning their gaze towards the direction indicated, the moon is discovered by a person, who is anxious to see it; even so, God is realized by a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, who is anxious to realize Him, when, following the scriptures or the teaching of a saint, he adopts a discipline and carries it out with faith. And just as pointing his finger, a person can only say that the moon is above that branch by a cubit, or it is just close to the corner of that house, even so, the scriptures and saints, when they speak of the dual and non-dual forms of worship, only point the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> towards God; but there can be no doubt about the fact that unless one has actually realized God, he can never understand what constitutes the reality about God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We shall try to make the point clearer by another example. Let us imagine a person belonging to this earth going to a world below the earth, which is totally covered by darkness, where people carry on their business with the help of the light given by fire and electricity, where the phenomenon called day and night never takes place, and the sun, moon and stars, etc., have no existence at all. There he asked the local people, “Is there no daybreak at all in this region?” The people of that world felt very much surprised at this question, and began to wonder what the day was. Then he explained to them that when the sun rises it is day, and when it goes down, it is night. This made them all the more curious. What is the sun? They asked. He replied, “It is a huge ball of light possessed of extraordinary brilliance, which, when it rises, totally drives away darkness, and lights up all the quarters.” Thereupon the residents of that nether world set up a bulb of one thousand candle power and enquired—“Is your sun similar to this?” He replied, “This is nothing compared to the sun.” Then those people set up a bulb of ten thousand candle power. “Is your sun like this?” They asked again. But still he replied that compared to the sun that light was nothing at all. In the end, those people made a light using all the electric power in their possession, but yet the man continued to assert that that light was nothing compared to the light of the sun. The residents of that world concluded from this that the man was a liar. How could there be any light more brilliant and powerful than the one they had just set up? The man, thereupon replied, “I am sorry I am unable to make you comprehend my point. What I mean to say cannot be described by words and is really inconceivable. So long as you have not actually seen the sun, you will not understand what it is.” Then, the residents of that world deputed one of their own men to come to this earth under the guidance of that man. When they both reached the earth, it was the midnight of the new-moon, and extreme darkness prevailed everywhere. To the resident of that nether world that very darkness appeared as light, and he asked his companion, “Is this what you call the day?” The companion replied, “No, this is the dense darkness of night.” After this when the darkness diminished a little, and there was twilight, he again asked—“Has the day broken now?” The companion replied, “No, we are still passing through the night.” Then, slowly the stars began to fade, and there was only half-an-hour before sunrise, when the resident of the nether world again enquired whether the day has dawned, but his companion still replied in the negative. “What are these stars?”—the newcomer asked. The companion replied, “Like this earth, they are so many separate worlds and balls of light.” Now, the light of the stars grew more dim, and when it was only five or six minutes before sunrise all of them, except the śukra (Venus) and the Br̥haspati  (Jupiter), totally disappeared. And the moment the sun rose, śukra and Br̥haspati also disappeared from sight. The sun appeared so very bright that the resident of the nether world could not even look it—he saw the sun’s rays with his back turned towards the sun. At midday, when the sun became very bright, it was impossible for the poor soul even to gaze at it. His companion then handed to him a dark glass through which he was asked to look, even as we watch an eclipse of the sun, and told him that it was the thing he now observed in the sky, which made day and night on the earth. Thereupon the fellow exclaimed in wonder that he now really understood what are day and night, and what is the sun!</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">After this experience, the fellow returned to his own world. There, he was at once surrounded by his friends who eagerly asked, whether he had actually seen day, night and the sun? What kind of a thing was the sun? How bright was it? What are day and night like? They repeated the very same questions to their friend as they had put to the man who had originally come from the earth. Their friend replied, “The sun is a ball of light; it is infinitely brighter than our electric lights.” They again asked, “Explain this infinite degree of brightness to us? You know the language in which we speak.” He replied, “It is impossible to describe that thing to you. Unless you have seen it, you cannot know what it is. There is nothing in our world with which it can be compared, and referring to which I can say it is like this. You can comprehend it only after direct perception; without such experience, you can never expect to understand what it is.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The illustration shows how difficult it is to understand even an ordinary thing like the sun without direct perception. When this is so, how is it possible to understand God without direct realization, and how can the nature of God be explained by one person to another? Nevertheless, the scriptures and saints try to describe as much as is possible of being described by words; but, truly speaking, none can make others comprehend the truth. The method of teaching of every religious teacher is different from that of other teachers. When tested by reason, no system will appear to be wholly unshakable, flawless and safely grounded on reason. For example, out of twenty sects, one sect affirms a particular principle, and the other nineteen deny it. Thus the principle of every sect is ruled out by the other nineteen; therefore nothing can be really established by logic or reason.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, there are hundreds of commentaries on the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. Which of them should be regarded as true, and whose explanation should be adopted as correct? All of them show fundamental differences, and give different explanations to the verses. Take one commentary out of these hundred; you will find it is opposed by the rest of the commentaries. This proves that all of them are mutually contradictory. But one thing common among these commentaries is that they all show equal respect to the text of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. So far as the original text is concerned, there is no difference of opinion among them. Even so, God, who is the foundation of everything, is one; He is the supreme truth, beyond mind and speech.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to know God, the Sādhaka should take refuge in God as well as the saints. Addressing Arjuna, the Lord said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Viṣṇusahasranāma</span>, it is said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“One who has taken refuge in Vāsudeva (God) and has completely surrendered himself to Vāsudeva, being freed from sins and possessed of a pure heart, realizes the eternal, supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma </span>or God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">And referring to the need for seeking refuge with saints, the Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिन:॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Attain this knowledge by all means. If you prostrate yourself at the feet of the wise, render them all forms of service, and question them with a guileless heart, again and again, those wise seers of Truth will unfold that Knowledge to you. Acquiring that Knowledge you will no more be subjected to delusion like this, Arjuna, and through it you will see all beings first in your own self, and then in Me (the Oversoul).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is God-realization; and this has been variously described as attainment of the supreme abode, the supreme goal, the supreme indestructible and the unmanifest, etc.</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-4">Faith in God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The questions which have been asked about God are not at all surprising to me, for the subject is one which baffles human intellect. The wonder of wonders is that we do not really believe in God even though we profess theism. Those who believe in God without understanding His true nature declare Him to be omniscient <span class="char-style-override-15">(सर्वज्ञ)</span>, omnipotent <span class="char-style-override-15">(सर्वशक्तिमान्)</span>, just <span class="char-style-override-15">(न्यायकारी)</span>, the dispenser of the fruit of our actions <span class="char-style-override-15">(कर्मफलदाता)</span>, and a compact mass of reality, knowledge and bliss; but they do not obey the laws framed by Him. Their belief in God is only nominal; it is due to their folly that the existence of God is being questioned all over the world at the present day. Although I consider those who have such blind faith in God better than their friends who altogether deny His existence, I denounce them because it is these blind believers that are mainly responsible for having spread the cult of atheism. Their belief alone is praiseworthy who believe in God knowing Him what He really is. For the conduct of the man who has understood the reality of God can never transgress the bounds of propriety as laid down by God. On the contrary, his conduct serves as a model for others and compels their admiration. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>  III. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whatsoever a great man does, others try to follow him. The people act up to the standard set up by him.” It is these people who are the true exponents of theism—I am only an ordinary man. Although I find myself unable to answer questions relating to God, I venture to submit, for the perusal of my readers as well as for self-gratification, to the best of my knowledge, some of my views on the subject, which are the outcome partly of my association with pious men and partly of my own reflection. I hope the kind readers will overlook my failings as those of a child. Theology is a very profound and obscure subject and even the most erudite of scholars are confounded while trying to grasp its truths, to say nothing of ordinary persons like myself.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Question </span>1. Why should we believe in God?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Answer—</span>(a) God showers His mercy on everyone as a matter of course, administers justice without any recompense and loves all equally. It is therefore obligatory on us to believe in Him, and humanity consists in discharging one’s obligation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(b) Without belief in God it is not possible for anyone to investigate His true nature, and without investigating His true nature one cannot get an insight into it, and one cannot attain lasting happiness without knowing God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(c) Belief in God stimulates a desire to know His virtues, loving nature and greatness and an endeavour to repeat His names, to meditate on His nature, and to hear of, and dwell on, His virtues, whereby one’s sins, weaknesses and afflictions are eradicated and supreme bliss is attained.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(d) One who believes in God after fully comprehending His nature cannot commit any immoral act. Those who are found indulging in immoral practices do not really believe in God. They are only impostors.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(e) Those who sincerely believe in God have always triumphed. The scriptures abound in remarkable instances of this, such as those of Dhruva, Prahlāda and many others. Even at the present day those who sincerely believe in God and approach Him in a spirit of dedication are seen flourishing.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(f) The Vedas, Smr̥tis, and other scriptures alike are useful only in so far as they believe in the existence of God. For all the scriptures aim at establishing His existence.</p>
<p class="Shlok">वेदे रामायणे चैव पुराणे भारते तथा। </p>
<p class="Shlok">आदौ मध्ये तथा चान्ते हरि: सर्वत्र गीयते॥ <span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>, <span class="char-style-override-10">the Rāmāyaṇa</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Purāṇas</span> as well as the <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata</span> Hari (God) is extolled at the beginning, in the middle as well as at the end.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Q. </span>2. What harm is there in denying God?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Answer —</span>(a)  Denial of the existence of an All-pervading God who dispenses the fruit of our actions promotes unruliness in man. An unruly man develops in himself vices such as mendacity, duplicity, thieving, illicit love, violence etc., and evil propensities such as lust, anger, greed, infatuation, conceit, etc., and is thereby degraded, with the result that he grows all the more unhappy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(b) If we do not believe in God, we cannot have a curiosity about His true nature and without that we cannot liberate our souls.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(c) Disbelief in God makes us guilty of ungratefulness. For there is no wonder if those who do not believe in God, the supreme Father who creates and maintains the whole world and is the friend of all, do not recognise even their parents who begot and brought them up. And is there a being more ungrateful than the man who does not recognise his own parents who served him from his very birth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(d) By not believing in God a man loses his spirituality and imbibes bestiality. Careful observation will clearly show that those who do not believe in God gradually evince these characteristics.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are numerous other serious evils resulting from disbelief in God; they are not mentioned here for want of space.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Q. </span>3. What are the strong arguments in favour of the existence of God?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Answer —</span>This question is not at all surprising, nor does it reveal any wisdom. It is an ordinary thing for the people to ask this question. Nay, even an intelligent man is confronted with doubts concerning a subject which cannot be grasped by ordinary intellect, to say nothing of ordinary persons. But it should be borne in mind that to ask for proofs in favour of God, who is self-evident and furnishes the proof for everything else, is mere childishness. To question the existence of God is as absurd as to ask about one’s own self whether one exists or not. If it is urged that one’s own self is evident while God is not, our reply is that God is even more evident than our own self. If anyone asks in what way God is more evident than our own self, our rejoinder is this. One may argue that just as the objects and bodies that we behold in a dream no longer exist when we are wide wake, even so the objects and bodies that we perceive in our waking life may be only a dream to some one else. For we observe that just as the objects of our dreams undergo change in the dream, the objects of our waking life also undergo transformation in our waking life. But that immutable God who is responsible for the existence of all these objects and who persists even after all these have perished, who is the support <span class="char-style-override-16">(आधार)</span> and foundation <span class="char-style-override-16">(अधिष्ठान)</span> of everything is much more manifest than our individual existence. But He is manifest only to those noble souls who have been extolled in every sacred book. They alone who are endowed with a penetrating intellect can directly perceive God by means of their sharp intellect. The Vedas, the Smr̥tis, the Chronicles (the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmāyaṇa</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata</span>), the <span class="char-style-override-10">Purāṇas</span> and other scriptures, and the utterances of holy men bear testimony to this fact. Nay, those who desire to perceive God can do so by following the methods laid down in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Smr̥tis</span> and prescribed by holy men. Inferential proofs are also forthcoming in favour of the existence of God. Inference consists in deducing the existence of a cause from that of an effect. In this universe we do not find anything coming into existence or functioning without an efficient cause. From this we conclude that there is a tremendous force which created the earth, the ocean, the sun, the moon, the stars, the fire, the air, the sky, the directions <span class="char-style-override-16">(दिशा)</span> and time and which controls them according to certain fixed laws. That force should be recognised as God. It is not correct to say that everything springs up of its own accord without any efficient cause, which it is not necessary to postulate, just as we find seeds originating from plants and plants growing from seeds. First of all let us consider whether it is the seed or the plant that came into existence first. If we are told that the seed came into existence first or that the tree preceded the seeds, we ask where it came from. And if it is urged that both came into being together, the question is how and by whom they were brought into existence. For an effect cannot come into being without a cause. He who created the seed and plants, etc., is God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Our next question is, Is what you call nature sentient or insentient ? If you say it is insentient it is not possible for anything to come into existence or function without the existence or guidance of a sentient being. And if you say it is sentient we have no quarrel with you; for that sentient power which has brought this universe into existence is none else but God, call Him what you may. Without an intelligent guiding principle not only can the world not come into existence but it cannot function regularly. We do not find even the smallest machine worked without an engineer. Any organisation whatsoever will fall through if not supervised by a skilled organiser. Hence that power which runs the universe according to certain fixed laws should be recognised as God. Without an all-pervading, all-powerful and all-knowing God the various creatures cannot be made to reap the fruit of their respective actions according to their merits. It is not correct to say that an agent automatically reaps the fruit of his actions; for the actions themselves, insentient as they are, do not possess the faculty of adjusting the fruit of good and evil actions according to their merits and a sentient creature would not voluntarily reap the bitter consequences of his own misdeeds. A thief commits a burglary and the ruler in whose territory the theft is committed sentences him for the crime. But the thief never goes to the gaol of his own accord nor can his theft take him to that place. It is the officers appointed under the authority of the king who sentence him to a term of imprisonment commensurate with the seriousness of his crime. Similarly, the various deities or intelligences appointed by God bring woe to the sinners by way of punishment for their sins. In the same way a creature is himself unable to enjoy the fruit of his good actions in the shape of worldly pleasures. Just as a person obeying the laws of a king gets a fixed amount as reward for his good behaviour directly from the king or through the officers appointed by him, similarly, those who perform meritorious deeds get the reward for their actions, as ordained by God. The creatures themselves, infatuated as they are by ignorance, do not possess the necessary knowledge and capacity to migrate freely from one body to another according to their good or evil actions.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Besides this we find a purpose everywhere in the functions of the universe. Such a purposive universe can be created by none else than a highly intelligent sentient agent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From the above exposition it is clear beyond doubt that without a God the world can neither come into existence nor function, nor can the creatures reap the fruit of their actions according to their merits, nor again is it possible for a purposive universe to come into being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The above arguments have been advanced on the basis of inferential reasoning. As a matter of fact, God is self-evident because all proofs derive their validity from Him. Hence no other proofs are required to substantiate His existence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The scriptures also bear testimony to the existence of God, all the four <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Smr̥tis</span>, the Chronicles as well as the <span class="char-style-override-10">Purāṇas</span> aim at establishing the existence of God. Numerous texts can be quoted from the above works to corroborate this fact, e.g.</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-5">Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A friend has asked me how objects constituted of the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span>—<span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva, Rajas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Tamas</span>—evolve from <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> (Primordial Matter) and on what grounds <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> has been declared as the doer and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> or the individual soul as the experiencer (of joys and sorrows). The following is our submission in reply to this question. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रकृतिं पुरुषं चैव विद्‍ध्यनादी उभावपि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विकारांश्च गुणांश्चैव विद्धि प्रकृतिसम्भवान्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XIII. 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“<span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span>, know both these as without beginning. And know all modifications such as likes and dislikes etc., and all objects constituted of the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> as born of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here the modifications and the objects of the nature of the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> have been declared as evolved from <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>. Therefore, the first thing to be ascertained is the number of the modifications. Regarding these Lord says in verse 6 of the same Discourse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इच्छा द्वेष: सुखं दु:खं संघातश्चेतना धृति:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतत्  क्षेत्रं समासेन सविकारमुदाहृतम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Desire, aversion, joy and sorrow, the physical body, consciousness, firmness; thus is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Kṣetra</span>, with its evolutes (modifications) briefly stated.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> The verse immediately preceding it (XIII.5) enumerates the elements constituting the body. Of the modifications mentioned above, desire and aversion, joy and sorrow, firmness and consciousness are the modifications of the heart. The physical body is an evolute of the five elements. Being of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type, firmness and consciousness are welcome modifications. Being an evolute of attachment, desire is virtually the same as attachment. These attachment and aversion are the root of all other modifications. Our mental attitude with regard to something agreeable is ‘attachment’, while that in respect something of disagreeable is ‘aversion’. All that is disagreeable excites aversion, pain, fear and jealousy, rivalry and anxiety. Besides aversion itself gives rise to a number of other morbid feelings. Similarly, attachment too excites many a morbid feeling. Desire also leads to such feelings. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> says;—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सङ्गात्संजायते काम: कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोह: सम्मोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रम:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्मृतिभ्रंशाद् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">      (II. 62-63)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All these are modifications of attachment and desire alone. From attachment springs up desire, and from desire (unfulfilled) ensues anger; then confusion of memory, thence loss of memory and from loss of memory one rushes headlong to complete degradation. All these modifications are the offspring of attachment and desire alone. That is why the Lord says in the (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XIII. 6) that He referred to the modifications only briefly. Now let us come to the other issue. In the second half of (XIII. 19) the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विकारांश्च गुणांश्चैव विद्धि प्रकृतिसम्भवान्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Know all modifications and all objects constituted of the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> as born of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva, Rajas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Tamas</span> are the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span>. It is from Prakr̥ti that all these three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span>, whether of the nature of effects or of instruments, proceed and propagate themselves. Before the process of Creation <span class="char-style-override-10">(Mahāsarga)</span> is set into operation only two entities, viz., <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span>, exist. <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> means the Supreme Spirit and <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> His Energy. In other words, <span class="char-style-override-10">śakti</span> and śaktimān are the only two entities present at that time. They are the parents of this entire creation. In verse 3 of Discourse (XIV) of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> we are told that Prakr̥ti or Primordial Matter is the womb while He is the Procreator, who deposits the seed. Therefore, Prakr̥ti is the Mother of all creation and He is the Father who deposits the seed from which sprouts forth the entire universe. In this way all objects constituted of the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇa</span>s evolve from <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> alone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the beginning of each round of creation the universe is brought into existence and at the time of universal dissolution all beings merge in Prakr̥ti. The gross bodies of all beings disappear at the time of dissolution. The souls tenanting the subtle bodies persist, but their subtle bodies too get merged in their cause <span class="char-style-override-10">(Prakr̥ti)</span>. Thus at the time of universal dissolution everything disappears. Again at the time of creation everything is brought forth in same way. Some dissimilarities are noticed in the process of creation and dissolution described in various <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> mentions the same number of categories as have been enumerated in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga-Sūtras</span> of the great sage PataÛjali and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya-Sūtras</span> of Lord Kapila. The process of creation as delineated in the latter two works is as follows—<span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> brought forth the <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahattattva</span>; from the <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahattattva</span> was evolved the cosmic ego; from the ego proceeded the mind and the five subtle elements and from the five subtle elements sprang up the <span class="char-style-override-10">ten Indriyas</span>, namely, the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell, the tongue, the hands, the feet and the organs of procreation and defecation and the five gross elements, viz., ether, air, fire, water and earth. The same subject has been dealt with in <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> (XIII. 5) as under—</p>
<p class="Shlok">महाभूतान्यहंकारो बुद्धिरव्यक्तमेव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च चेन्द्रियगोचरा:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is to say, the five gross elements, the ego, the intellect, the Unmanifest or the Primordial Matter, the <span class="char-style-override-10">ten Indriyas</span> and the mind plus the five objects of senses bring the number of categories to twenty-four. These very categories, numbering twenty-four, have been enumerated in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya </span>and <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> systems. Of course, there is a slight difference in the order of their evolution because the creation of the universe does not follow the same order every time. The order slightly varies in every case. That is why the processes of evolution delineated in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhāgavata</span> and other <span class="char-style-override-10">Purāṇas</span>, the first chapter of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Manusmr̥ti</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> differ from one another in some respect or other. But the fundamental principle is the same, viz., that all material objects have evolved from <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> or Matter. Now let us ascertain the order in which the evolution takes place according to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. For this we shall have to read the following line in a reverse order—</p>
<p class="Shlok">महाभूतान्यहंकारो बुद्धिरव्यक्तमेव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च चेन्द्रियगोचरा:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Unmanifest <span class="char-style-override-10">(Avyakta)</span> lies at the root of all. From this Unmanifest springs up everything. The Unmanifest stands for the undifferentiated Matter of the energy of God. Moving backwards from this energy of God in the form of the Unmanifest we find that from the Unmanifest came forth the intellect. It is the “Intellect” of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> that has been referred to as the principle of Cosmic Intelligence or <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahattattva</span>. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedānta</span> speaks of it as the principle of Cosmic Intelligence, while the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> call it <span class="char-style-override-10">“Mahattattva.” </span>This intellect brought forth the ego from which evolved the five <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhūtas</span> and so on. These five <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhūtas</span> are the same as the five subtle elements and are causal in character because these five as well as the three foregoing ones are the causes of the other evolutes following therefrom. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya</span> Philosophy too we are told that of the twenty-four categories, one, viz., Primordial Matter, is merely causal in character, seven are both causes and effects and the remaining sixteen are mere effects. In <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> this topic has been dealt with as under—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भूमिरापोऽनलो वायु: खं मनो बुद्धिरेव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहंकार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृतिरष्टधा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (VII. 4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Earth, water, fire, air and ether—these five subtle elements plus mind, intellect and ego make the number eight. Here “mind” has been substituted for “Primordial Matter.” But mind is not the cause of any other category. It is for this reason that the great śaṅkarācārya, in his commentary on the above verse, has interpreted <span class="char-style-override-10">“Manas”</span> not as “mind” but as “ego” and ego as the undifferentiated Māyā. We should take all these eight to be cause since the Lord has spoken of them as such. Therefore, the order of evolution should be understood as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From the undifferentiated <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span> sprang up the intellect, which in its turn brought forth the ego and from the ego proceeded the five subtle elements and the mind. Again, from the five subtle elements evolved the ten <span class="char-style-override-10">Indriyas</span> and thereafter the five sense-objects. There is no difference of opinion about the fact that the five sense-objects and ten <span class="char-style-override-10">Indriyas</span> sprang up from the five subtle elements. Some take the five elements as evolutes of the mind while others believe them as having proceeded from the ego. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhāgavata</span> delineate the process of the evolution of the five elements differently. One such order is that from ether sprang up the air, which in its turn brought forth fire; from fire proceeded water and from water appeared the earth. Recognizing all the processes of evolution mentioned above, one arrives at the conclusion that at the time of dissolution the earth is submerged in water, which is dried up by fire; fire in its turn is extinguished by the air, which gets lost in ether. In this way ether alone remains. At the time of final dissolution ether as well as all the other evolutes of the five subtle elements disappear in the ego, wherein the mind also loses itself. The ego gets merged in the intellect <span class="char-style-override-10">(Mahattattva) </span>and the intellect in the Unmanifest <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>. The Unmanifest <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span> is a potency of God. It persists even during the final dissolution. According to the same process when creation starts anew, it is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahattattva</span> or cosmic intellect that appears first of all from <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>. From the intellect springs up the cosmic ego, which in its turn brings forth the mind as well as the five <span class="char-style-override-10">Tanmātrās</span>. It is these five <span class="char-style-override-10">Tanmātrās</span> that are spoken of as the subtle elements, and when they are so-called, it is but meet and proper that they should be held to be the causes of the sense-objects. If, on the other hand, these five objects of sense are held to be the same as the five subtle elements, the five gross elements should be regarded as the evolutes of the subtle sense-objects which are the same as the subtle elements. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya </span>systems hold this view. This has been recognized as the process of evolution of all the categories. <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> alone existed at the beginning of creation. At the time of dissolution the gross bodies of all beings disappear in the cosmic subtle nature, which itself is merged in the primordial nature. This primordial nature is the resting-place of all. It is the same as the cosmic causal body. Take for example the case of a cloud, which is composed of a number of molecules. Just as the cloud and each one of its molecules are the same, similar is the case with <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> and all that is comprised in it. Of course <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> has no molecules or atoms; it is only in order to elucidate the point that the analogy of a cloud has been given to it. Primordial Matter admits of no such divisions as to lead us to assume the existence of molecules in it. In case of ether too, there are some who hold that it does consist of atoms, while others do not hold this view. Ether, of course, can be so divided in this sense that the hundreds of birds that wing the air have each occupied a portion of the ether in the part of the sky which hold their bodies. Similarly, in order to clarify the point it can be held that the portion of Primordial Matter with which an embodied soul had clothed itself is its sheath or resting-place or it may be said to be its casual body. Thus the Jīva abides in Prakr̥ti along with the casual body. If he could get rid of the causal body, he would have realized God. Liberation or God-realization is not attained only because the Jīva remains established in the causal body. It is the causal body that comprises the subtle body and in the subtle body are stored the latencies of all his virtuous and evil deeds. The equilibrium of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti </span>is disturbed only to enable the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīvas</span> to reap the consequences of their meritorious and evil deeds that are yet to be reaped. The periods of cosmic activity and of the suspension of such activity are as a rule of the same duration. It is after the end of the period of final dissolution and at the beginning of the next round of creation that the equilibrium of Primordial Matter gets disturbed. This disturbance causes a flutter in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>, which gives rise to ten evolutes and thirteen instruments. Says the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कार्यकरणकर्तृत्वे हेतु: प्रकृतिरुच्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पुरुष: सुखदु:खानां भोक्तृत्वे हेतुरुच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">      (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XIII. 20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“<span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> is declared to be responsible for bringing forth the evolutes and the instruments; while the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> (the individual soul) is said to bring about the experience of joys and sorrows.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has already been discussed how <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> is responsible for bringing forth the evolutes and the instruments. The evolutes are ten in number—the five elements, viz., ether, air, fire, water and earth, and the five objects of sense-perception, viz., sound, touch, colour, taste and smell. The instruments or media are thirteen—the five organs of action, the five senses of perception, the mind, the intellect and the ego. Thus the ten evolutes and the thirteen instruments make a total of twenty-three. If Prakr̥ti is added to this, the number of the fundamental principles comes to twenty-four. Some recognize the mind, intellect, <span class="char-style-override-10">Citta</span> and ego as the four aspects of the inner sense. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, however, enumerates only three aspects. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga </span>and <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya</span> systems also subscribe to the view of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. <span class="char-style-override-10">Citta</span> and mind are believed to be one. <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> alone is the cause of the other twenty-three categories. It is due to this that <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> has been declared as responsible for the evolution of these twenty-three fundamental principles. These twenty-three are its evolutes. Now we have to consider how the individual soul brings about the experience of joys and sorrows.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the soul abiding in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> which is the experiencer of joys and sorrows. As a matter of fact it is neither the pure self nor <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> that experiences joys and sorrows. <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> is not the experiencer because it is insentient nor can the soul be the experiencer because it is pure. The experiencer is the embodied soul which is the union of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span>. Hence the experiencer of joys and sorrows is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> (Spirit) identified with <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>—<span class="char-style-override-14">पुरुष: प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्‍क्ते प्रकृतिजान् गुणान्</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> </span>(XIII. 21). Here it is the embodied soul which has been referred to under the name of Puruṣa. It is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> abiding in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti </span>which is the experiencer of joys and sorrows and not the pure Self.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Mahar̥ṣi</span> PataÛjali says in his “Aphorisms on Yoga”—<span class="char-style-override-14">हेयं दु:खमनागतम्</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga-Sūtras</span> II. 16). “Pain which has yet to come is worth eschewing. <span class="char-style-override-10">‘Anāgata’</span> is that which is not yet come. The sorrows that have already come, that is, those which are a thing of the past have not been declared here as worth eschewing, since they have come and gone. The sorrow existing at the present moment will also become a thing of the past the very next moment. That too need not be considered. But future sorrows should be avoided. Now the question arises as to what is the cause of pains not yet come. The reply is—<span class="char-style-override-14">द्रष्टृदृश्ययो: संयोगो हेयहेतु:</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span>(<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid,</span> II. 17). The union or identity of the knowing Self and the insentient Prakr̥ti is the cause of that which is to be avoided—the cause of sorrows and sufferings. Hence it is only the Self abiding in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> to whom joys and sorrows come. Now one should like to know what is the cause of this liaison between matter and Spirit. There must be some cause for that too. The reply to this is—<span class="char-style-override-14">तस्य हेतुरविद्या</span><span class="char-style-override-16"> </span>“Nescience is its cause.” This nescience is got rid of through spiritual wisdom. The dawn of spiritual wisdom eradicates ignorance and with the eradication of ignorance <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> get dissociated. Thus when they are disunited no experiencer of joys and sorrows remains, because the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> has his object accomplished. The question now arises—when the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> has his object accomplished, does the world still persist in his eyes or not? In reply to it the sage PataÛjali says—<span class="char-style-override-14">कृतार्थं प्रति नष्टमप्यनष्टं तदन्यसाधारणत्वात्</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span>(<span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span>. II. 22). In the eyes of the man who accomplished his purpose matter ceases. The creation being intended for the commonality, does exist for them who have not attained liberation. To the realized soul this world is a non-entity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus it is proved that it is the soul abiding in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> who experiences joys and sorrows. How does he experience them? Through ignorance. What is the nature of his ignorance? It consists in identifying oneself with the body and recognizing it as one’s own. A dreaming man identifies himself with the body of his dream or regards it as his own and so on. But when he wakes up, all his dream-world melts away. Then he comes to realize that the dream-world was mere thought, that it was nothing in reality. Nevertheless the objects of the dream appear as real while he is dreaming. Similarly, the world appears as real while one is buried in the sleep of ignorance. From the Advaitic point of view, really speaking, the body as well as the world is imaginary. All this creation is entirely imaginary. According to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya</span> systems it is in a state of constant flux. It is ignorance rooted in the mind which is responsible for the experience of joys and sorrows. According to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhya </span>systems, as a matter of fact, the body and mind are not mere products of imagination. They do exist; but they are mutable, are always changing. The Spirit gets liberated when it breaks off with them. According to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Advaita</span> Philosophy there is no such thing as breaking off. The world of matter is entirely dreamlike. It does not actually exist. Now one should like to know what kind of <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> is the experiencer of joy and sorrow. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">पुरुष: प्रकृतिस्थो हि भुङ्‍क्ते प्रकृतिजान् गुणान्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कारणं गुणसङ्गोऽस्य सदसद्योनिजन्मसु॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">      (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XIII. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> abiding in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> who senses the objects of the nature of the three Guṇas evolved from <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>. And it is contact with these <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> that is responsible for the birth of this soul in good and evil wombs.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Contact here means attachment and union. <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva, Rajas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Tamas</span> are the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span>. The embodied soul is cast into good or evil birth after death only according to the affinity it cherishes for a particular <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> and its contact with the same. He who is fond of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span> ascends to the higher worlds; he who conceives an affinity for <span class="char-style-override-10">Rajoguṇa</span> attains a human or other similar birth—while one who is <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span> by nature is born into the nether worlds—into the infernal regions or is born among the worms and insects and other species of the sub-human creation. The higher species are termed as <span class="char-style-override-10">“Sat”</span> while the lower ones are called <span class="char-style-override-10">“Asat.”</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the species lower than the human are <span class="char-style-override-10">“Asat” </span>and those higher than that are <span class="char-style-override-10">“Sat.” </span>Therefore, the man who abides in <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa </span>alone goes up by the bright path and attains God. But he who is characterized by <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span> mixed with <span class="char-style-override-10">Rajas</span> travels by the path of smoke, goes to heaven (the abode of gods) and after having tasted the heavenly enjoyments returns to the mortal world. In other words, if the ascending soul cherishes some desire, he returns to this world, but the desireless soul knows no return.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has been established above that the pure Self is not the experiencer; it is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa </span>(embodied Spirit) established in <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> who is the experiencer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now one should like to know who is the doer of virtuous and sinful acts. If it be urged that Prakr̥ti is the agent, it naturally follows that <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> alone should be the experiencer too. If, however, it is maintained that <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> is the doer, then what kind of <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> is the doer and where he is mentioned in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. Our reply is that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> declares the following five factors as contributory to the accomplishment of an act—</p>
<p class="Shlok">पञ्चैतानि महाबाहो कारणानि निबोध मे।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सांख्ये कृतान्ते प्रोक्तानि सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XVIII. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the branch of learning known by the name of <span class="char-style-override-10">“Sāṅkhya”</span>, which prescribes means for neutralizing all actions, these five factors have been mentioned as contributory to the accomplishment of all actions, know them from Me, Arjuna.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">अधिष्ठानं तथा कर्ता करणं च पृथग्विधम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टा दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XVIII. 14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The following are the factors operating towards the accomplishment of actions, viz., the seat of action and the agent, the organs of different kinds and the separate movements of divergent types; and the fifth is <span class="char-style-override-10">Daiva</span> or destiny.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here the body is the seat of action, the agent is the embodied Spirit. The five senses of perception, the five organs of action, mind, intellect and ego are the thirteen distinct organs or instruments. The activities of divergent types are the separate movements, and the fifth factor is <span class="char-style-override-10">Daiva</span>. The latencies of good and evil deeds performed in the past constitute what is called “<span class="char-style-override-10">Daiva</span>.” Some people construe <span class="char-style-override-10">Daiva</span> to mean God, while others take it in the sense of destiny. But such an interpretation is not correct. In this way the above five factors have been recognized as contributory to all actions. Work accomplished by these five factors is of two kinds—virtuous and sinful. With regard to this the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">शरीरवाङ्मनोभिर्यत्कर्म प्रारभते नर:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न्याय्यं वा विपरीतं वा पञ्चैते तस्य हेतव:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">       (XVIII. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“These five are the contributory causes of whatever action, right or wrong, a man performs with the mind, speech and body.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, even though the above five factors are contributory to the accomplishment of all actions, he who holds the pure self as responsible therefore betrays his ignorance. This is rank stupidity. In reality the Self is a non-doer. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्रैवं सति कर्तारमात्मानं केवलं तु य:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पश्यत्यकृतबुद्धित्वान्न स पश्यति दुर्मति:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XVIII. 16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Notwithstanding this, however, he who, having an impure mind, regards the absolute, taintless Self alone as the doer, that man of perverse understanding does not view aright,”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He is undoubtedly an ignoramous and his view is not correct, because the pure Self is not the doer. All actions, whether good or bad, are accomplished by the above-mentioned five-factors. That is to say these five factors alone are contributory to the accomplishment of all actions. All activities proceed from them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">By thus realizing the true character of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti </span>and <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> ignorance is got rid of by the grace of God and once a man is assured of the fact that the pure Self is neither a doer nor the non-experiencer, he is rid of all shackles of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karma </span>and realizes God.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-6">Dualistic and Non-Dualistic Worship in the Upaniṣads</p>
<p class="Shlok">ॐ पूर्णमद: पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्  पूर्णमुदच्यते।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">     (<span class="char-style-override-10">Br̥hadāraṇyaka</span>. V.i.1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That Brahman; this Brahman (universe) is also full. The full comes from the full (i.e., the latter effect comes from the former—the cause). If you accept the fullness of the full (effect) with the knowledge that this also is full then that is left behind is also full.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> constitute the root of the Hindu scriptures. They are the repositories of infinite Wisdom. The section of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>, dealing with Knowledge or Wisdom, is the crown, or culmination of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>. It is this portion which is famous throughout the world as the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣad </span>or <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedānta</span>. The characteristics of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> have been truly described in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>, and along with that they have laid down different practices for the realization of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, to suit the taste and spiritual aptitude of different types or classes of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span>. Symbolical worship, as described in them, has been recommended to be practised in both the ways—viz., (1) in one centre, and (2) universally, in all centres. It has been brought out that this worship may be pursued for either the enjoyments of this world, e.g., possession of wife, progeny, wealth, food, cattle, etc., or that of the other world, e.g., residence in the celestial garden amidst celestial damsels and drinking of the ambrosia, etc., and, together with this, many forms of practices have been laid down by them for the realization of God as well. In the present article, practices for the attainment of enjoyments of this world and the next will be left out. It will only deal briefly with the forms of worship for the realization of God, which have been elaborately described in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Various practices of God-realization have been laid down by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> through various lines of reasoning and thought in the form of illustrations, anecdotes, metaphors, hints, and prescribed and prohibitory rules of conduct. Pursuing spiritual life following any of these practices, man can realize God. All these practices may be generally classified under two heads—(1) dualistic worship, and (2) non-dualistic worship. Dualistic worship, again, are of two kinds. One is that in which dualism is both the means and the end; and the other is that in which dualism is only the means, but the end is non-dual. We shall firstly deal with the dualistic form of worship.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-6-1" xml:lang="en-US">DUALISTIC WORSHIP</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In dualistic worship, three substances are considered to be eternal—(1) Māyā (Prakr̥ti); (2) <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> (the individual soul) (3) the Lord of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>, God. Descriptions of these three substances occur in various places of the Upaniṣads. <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> is inert, and its product, the objective world, is transient, perishable and subject to change. The individual soul and God—both are eternal, sentient and embodiment of Bliss; but the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> possesses finite knowledge, whereas God is omniscient; the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva </span>is powerless, whereas God is almighty; the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva </span>is a part and God is the Whole; the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> is the enjoyer, and God is the Witness; the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> is the worshipper, and God, the object of worship. That very God, manifesting Himself on earth from time to time, delivers His message to <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> for the latter’s spiritual good.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Kenopaniṣad</span> records a story connected with this very subject. Once upon a time, through the grace and power of God, the celestials in heaven attained victory over the demons. But due to ignorance and pride, they began to believe that the victory had been attained by their own power. In order to remove this pride of theirs born of ignorance, and thus do them good, the Lord manifested Himself before those celestials as a <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span>, possessed of attributes and form. Curious to know who the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> was, Indra and the other celestial lords at first deputed <span class="char-style-override-10">Agni</span>, the Fire-god, as their messenger. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> asked <span class="char-style-override-10">Agni</span>, “Who are you? What are your powers?” <span class="char-style-override-10">Agni</span> replied, “I am the god of fire, if I want I can reduce the entire universe to ashes.” Placing a blade of grass before him, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> invited <span class="char-style-override-10">Agni</span> to burn it; but the latter failed to do so. Thereupon returning to the celestials, <span class="char-style-override-10">Agni</span> reported that he had failed to know who the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> was. The celestials, then, sent the Wind-god. Him also the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> asked, “Who are you, and what are your powers?” He replied, “I am Wind, if I want I can blow away the entire universe.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> placed a blade of grass before him as well, and invited him to blow it. But the Wind-god failed to do so, and returning to the gods reported that he had failed to know who the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span> was. Lastly, went Indra himself, the Chief of gods, but the moment he approached the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span>, the latter disappeared from view. Then, finding Goddess Umā in that part of the sky, Indra questioned Her about the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yakṣa</span>. She replied, “He was Brahma himself; it was the victory of this Brahma which you regarded as your own victory.” This instruction of the Goddess enlightened Indra about <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. Thereafter, the gods of Fire and Wind also recognized <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. Because they were the first to recognize Brahma, the three gods, viz., Indra, <span class="char-style-override-10">Agni</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Vāyu</span>, are regarded as superior to the other gods.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The story proves that whatever power, intelligence and greatness are exhibited by a living being are derived from God. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> also the Lord declared—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यद्विभूतिमत्सत्त्वं श्रीमदूर्जितमेव वा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्तदेवावगच्छ त्वं मम तेजोंऽशसम्भवम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (X. 41)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Every such creature as is glorious, brilliant or powerful, know that to be a manifestation of a spark of my effulgence.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> describe the dualistic form of worship of God, now possessed of form, now formless, now possessed of attributes, and now in His absolute aspect. They also show that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> derives success according to the motive with which he adores his object of worship. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Kaṭhopaniṣad,</span> describing the dualistic worship of <span class="char-style-override-10">Praṇava</span>, which is both attributeless and possessed of attributes, the god of Death says to Naciketā—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतद्‍ध्येवाक्षरं ब्रह्म एतद्‍ध्येवाक्षरं परम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतद्‍ध्येवाक्षरं ज्ञात्वा यो यदिच्छति तस्य तत्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतदालम्बनं श्रेष्ठमेतदालम्बनं परम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतदालम्बनं ज्ञात्वा ब्रह्मलोके महीयते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">       (I. ii. 16-17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“This <span class="char-style-override-10">Akṣaraṁ</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Aum</span>) is the very same as <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>; this Aum means the supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. Knowing this Aum, one attains whatever one may seek. This support is the best, it is the supreme refuge. Knowing this support well, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> attains glory in <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmaloka</span>—the abode of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, men who seek their spiritual welfare should worship God only for the sake of God-realization, crossing for all time the ocean of misery in the form of existence in this world, and not for obtaining worldly objects. Within this body of ours, God is ever present in every heart in His formless aspect, but because of their ignorance about Him, people go through all their misery and sufferings. He who worships God comes to know Him, and hence crossing all misery and grief, he realizes God. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Muṇḍakopaniṣad</span> also it is said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया</p>
<p class="Shlok">समानं वृक्षं परिषस्वजाते।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">       (III. i. 1—3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Two birds (the individual soul and God), always living together, and friendly towards each other, dwell upon one and the same tree (the body). One of them enjoys the fruit of that tree (in the shape of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karma</span>); but the other without partaking of that fruit only looks on as a witness. Dwelling on the same tree, the individual soul is merged in the deep attachment of the body, and feeling lack of power, and being deluded, grieves. But when through God’s causeless grace, it perceives God and His glory—God, who is ever worshipped by devotees and is different from it—then its grief ceases. And when this beholder (the individual soul) beholds the Supreme Person, the embodiment of divine effulgence, the ruler of all, the creator of even Brahmā, and the author of the world. Then, rising above virtue and vice, and attaining spotless purity, he as a devotee, who is also the possessor of Knowledge, attains the highest identity.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God, who is both possessed of attributes and attributeless, though devoid of senses, is yet the knower of object of senses. Though the creator and maintainer of all, He is yet a non-doer. Praises and prayers should be offered to that formless God within the heart, who is omniscient, all-pervading, gracious without cause and the supreme lover. Taking refuge in that best object of worship, man rises above all forms of misery, suffering, sin and modification, and attains liberation in the form of supreme peace and the supreme state. Therefore, one should take refuge in God, for the sake of God-realization, through the knowledge of God, who is the creator, sustainer and destroyer of all, almighty, the substratum of all, all-pervading, subtler than the subtlest, greater than the greatest, and the universal friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad </span>contains a detailed description of the dualistic worship of God. Some <span class="char-style-override-10">Mantras</span> taken from that <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣad</span> are being quoted below—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वेन्द्रियगुणाभासं सर्वेन्द्रियविवर्जितम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वस्य प्रभुमीशानं सर्वस्य शरणं बृहत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">       (III. 17)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He, who, though devoid of all the senses, knows all sense-objects, who is the lord of all, ruler of all, and the greatest support of all, should be resorted to.”</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, far we have described dualistic form of worship in which dualism is both the means and the end. Now, we shall deal with worship in which dualism is only the means, but the fruit or end is non-dual.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to the dualistic form of worship, four types of liberation have been described in the scriptures—(1) <span class="char-style-override-10">Sālokya</span>, (2) <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāmīpya</span>, (3) <span class="char-style-override-10">Sārūpya</span> and (4) <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāyujya</span>. In the first three of these, dualism is both the means and the end; but in the last, the Sāyujya form of liberation, dualism is maintained during the period of practice, but in the state which represents the goal or fruit, there is no dualism. Reaching the supreme abode of God, when one is privileged to reside there, it is called the “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sālokya</span>” form of liberation. Those who worship God cultivating the parental and similar other sentiments, attain the “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sālokya</span>”form of liberation. He, who, reaching the supreme abode of God enjoys the privilege of staying near God, is said to have attained the “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāmīpya</span>” form of liberation. <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> worshipping God through the cultivation of the servant-sentiment, or the lover sentiment, attain this “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāmīpya</span>” form of liberation. Reaching the supreme abode of God, when one lives there assuming God’s own form, it is called the “Sārūpya” form of liberation. <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> who worship God cultivating the sentiment of a friend attain this “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sārūpya</span>” form of liberation. These devotees of God come to possess all the qualities of God, except the special divine power of creation, protection and maintenance of the universe. Total absorption in and attainment of the non-dual state is called the “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāyujya</span>” form of liberation. <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhakas</span> who worship God cultivating the quiet-sentiment (through devotion mixed with Knowledge), attain this “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāyujya</span>” form of liberation, and those who worship God through the cultivation of enmity, hatred and fear, also, attain the “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāyujya</span>” form of liberation. Just as the various waters of the different rivers, renouncing their separate names and forms, falling into ocean, become the ocean itself, even so such a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, merging himself in God, becomes the same as God Himself. This is proved by various statements in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> as well as in the other scriptures. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Kaṭhopaniṣad</span> the God of Death says to Naciketā—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यथोदकं शुद्धे शुद्धमासिक्तं तादृगेव भवति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एवं मुनेर्विजानत आत्मा भवति गौतम॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Just as pure rain-water, dropped by the clouds on a sheet of pure water, becomes alike, even so, O Naciketā, the scion of Gautama, the soul of the Muni, who knows that God alone is everything, realizes God, that is, getting absorbed in God, becomes alike,”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Muṇḍakopaniṣad</span> also, says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, who carries on spiritual practice, believing <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>), the individual soul and God as three different entities, and at the same time holds that Prakr̥ti and God are identical, inasmuch as energy and its possessor are identical, and the individual soul though different, yet being a part of God is also identical with God; hence God, though separate from both <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span>, is identical with them—he, though following a spiritual discipline based on dualism, in the end realizes God as identical with him. This is corroborated by various statements in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> and other scriptures. For instance—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Showing thus the two processes of dualistic worship as laid down by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>, we shall next proceed to discuss non-dualistic worship according to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-6-2" xml:lang="en-US">NON-DUALISTIC WORSHIP</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There are four principal forms of non-dualistic worship. The first two of them have “That” as their object, and with the remaining two “Thou” is the goal or object, as briefly described below—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. Whatever appears to the senses in this animate and inanimate world is <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. There is nothing, which is different from God, who is solidified Existence, Knowledge and Bliss. Thus the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> should worship.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. That God, who is attributeless, formless, actionless and changeless is wholly beyond the transient, perishable, material, objective world, or <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>. Thus he should worship.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. The entire material and sentient, movable and immovable, animate and inanimate world is <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, and that Brahma am I. Hence all these are my forms—thus the worship should be practised.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. God, the Supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, who is beyond the perishable, transient and illusory objective world, and is formless, changeless, attributeless, eternal Knowledge and Bliss solidified, is verily my <span class="char-style-override-10">tmā</span> or soul, that is, the same as my Self—thus the worship should be practised.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For a better comprehension of these practices, they are being discussed below in some detail, with authoritative references from the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) In the beginning of creation; <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma </span>alone, Existence, Knowledge and Bliss solidified, existed. He desired, “Let Me become many, let Me appear” <span class="char-style-override-15">(</span><span class="char-style-override-14">सोऽकामयत। बहु स्यां प्रजायेयेति</span><span class="char-style-override-15">. </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Taittirīya</span> II vi. 1.<span class="char-style-override-15">)</span>—Thus the one <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> assumed many forms. Hence whatever there is in the world, material and sentient, movable and immovable, is God. The śruti says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ब्रह्मैवेदममृतं पुरस्ताद्‍ब्रह्म</p>

Comprehending this, one should adore it with a quiet mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) It has been shown that the entire material and sentient, movable and immovable, animate and inanimate world, which is the object indicated by the word “That”, is <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. Now, the object of the same word “That”, <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, in its attributeless aspect, will be described. That attributeless, formless, actionless, and changeless <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> is wholly beyond transient, perishable, material and objective <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>. Whatever object appears to the senses is born of ignorance. In reality, there is nothing beyond Brahma, which is Knowledge and Bliss solidified, infinite and free from attributes. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> who comes to experience this gets freed from birth and death, and realizes <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, the solidified form of infinite Knowledge and Bliss. This is confirmed by the scriptures and by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> at many places.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Kaṭhopaniṣad</span>, while describing the characteristics of Supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, the Lord of Death said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“God is realized only through the pure mind. Except God there is nothing else in the world. Therefore, he who beholds something else in this world proceeds from death to death, that is he goes through the processes of birth and death, again and again.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Muṇḍakopaniṣad</span> also it is said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English"> “That attributeless, formless Supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, or God, is neither apprehended by the eye, nor by speech, nor by the other senses, nor by askesis, nor by devotional rites. He is beheld only by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, possessed of a pure heart, performing constant meditation through that pure heart, by his intellect purified by the light of Knowledge.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Taittirīyopaṇiṣad</span> also says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ब्रह्मविदाप्नोति परम्। तदेषाभ्युक्ता। सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">     (II. i. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The knower of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> attains Supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. With reference to this (Knowledge), the following <span class="char-style-override-10">śruti</span> has been uttered—“<span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> is Truth, Knowledge and Infinity”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) Describing thus the process of worship of the word “That”, we shall now take up the process of worship of the word “Thou”. Whatever material and sentient, movable and immovable objects appear in the world, they are all <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, and who <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> is, that I am. Hence man should see the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self. That is to say, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> who cultivates the habit of feeling, that whatever exists is identical with the Self, transcending grief and delusion, attains <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, which is Knowledge and Bliss solidified.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is confirmed by the scriptures and supported by various <span class="char-style-override-10">Mantras</span> of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शन:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (VI. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The Yogī, who is united in identity with the All-pervading, infinite Consciousness, and looks on all with an equal eye, sees the Self present in all beings, and all beings as imaginary objects in the Self.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">ºśāvāsyopaniṣad</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्तु सर्वाणि भूतान्यात्मन्येवानुपश्यति।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Whoever beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, in other words, regards all beings as the Self, does no more look down on any creature. Whom will he hate, and how?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Similarly, to the saint who knows the secret of the Self, everything appears as Self and that beholder of the unity of the soul, suffers neither from delusion, nor from grief. That is to say, modifications like grief and delusion, etc., totally disappear from him who sees <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> alone, the embodiment of Knowledge and Bliss, pervading all beings.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The secret of this has been explained by means of a story in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Chāndogya-Upaniṣad</span>. The grandson of Aruṇa, and Uddālaka’s son, śwetaketu, had gone to his teacher in his twelfth year for the acquisition of Knowledge, and on the completion of his study, returned home when he was in his twenty-fourth year. Regarding himself as a man of intellect, and a good orator, he entered home devoid of any humility, and out of intellectual pride did not bow even to his father. Upon this, his father asked him.</p>
<p class="Gadya">श्वेतकेतो यन्नु सोम्येदं महामना अनूचानमानी स्तब्धोऽस्युत तमादेशमप्राक्ष्य:। येनाश्रुतॸश्रुतं भवत्यमतं मतमविज्ञातं विज्ञातमिति।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">śwetaketu replied, “Lord! What is that subject?”</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Thereupon, śwetaketu said, “Father, please explain this in more detail.” Uddālaka, the son of Aruṇi, replied—“Child, just as when the curd is churned, its fine particles forming butter, come to the surface; even so, when food is consumed, its fine particles, form the mind. The fine particles of water form the <span class="char-style-override-10">Prāṇa</span> (life-breath), and the fine particles of fire, butter, oil form speech. In reality, the mind, breath and speech, and their cause food, etc., being cause and effect, are in their ultimate analysis nothing but <span class="char-style-override-10">Sat</span>. For <span class="char-style-override-10">Sat</span> is the primordial cause of everything, it is the foundation or supreme support. All the various forms, which are the products of Sat, are nothing but mere different words and names. This <span class="char-style-override-10">Sat</span> is minuter than the atom and is the soul of everything. O śwetaketu, thou art That—<span class="char-style-override-10">Tattvamasi</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">śwetaketu said—“Lord, explain this once again to me.” The father, Aruṇi replied, “All right, bring me a fruit of the Indian Banyan tree; then I shall explain the subject further to you.” śwetaketu brought the fruit as desired. The father said, “Break it, and see what is there in it.” Breaking the fruit, śwetaketu replied “Lord, there are some very small seeds in it.” “Break one of them”, said ¤Rṣi Uddālaka. Breaking that small seed; śwetaketu reported, “Nothing can be perceived within it.” Then, Aruṇi said, “Child, you do not perceive the subtle truth within the small seed, from this extremely subtle truth, the huge tree comes into being. Just as the minute seed is the cause of the mighty tree, even so the subtle Sat is the cause and substratum of the external universe. O child, I say the truth, have faith in my words. This subtle substance is the soul; it is Sat, and it is the Universal Soul. O śwetaketu, thou art That—<span class="char-style-override-14">तत्त्वमसि</span>.”</p>

Seeing Him as the Self, ¤<span class="char-style-override-10">Rṣi</span> Vāmadeva realized—“I became Manu, I am the Sun.” Whosoever knows Brahma even now as “I am <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>” becomes this all. Even the gods fail to vanquish him; for he becomes the soul of them all.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to explain this secret truth, we find another story in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Br̥hadāraṇyakaUpaniṣad</span>. Sage YājÛavalkya had two wives—Maitreyī and Kātyāyanī. At the time of taking to the fourth order of <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsa</span>, sage YājÛavalkya said to Maitreyī—“Behold, I propose to raise myself from the present order of a householder’s life and enter the Saṁnyāsa, order; therefore, it is proper for me to divide my property between you and Kātyāyanī”. Maitreyī replied, “O venerable one, if the whole of this world with all its wealth were mine, could I become immortal thereby?” YājÛavalkya said, “No, your life will become just like the life of other wealthy men of the world. Wealth cannot be expected to bring immortality”. Maitreyī replied, “Of what use would that wealth be to me, if it does not bring immortality? O venerable one, please tell me the means of obtaining immortality.” Hearing this, YājÛavalkya said, “Maitreyī, you are, indeed, blessed; you were dear to me before, and now what you say is also dear to me. Come, I will explain the subject to you; endeavour to comprehend what I say.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, YājÛavalkya continued—</p>
<p class="Gadya">‘न वा अरे सर्वस्य कामाय सर्वं प्रियं भवत्यात्मनस्तु कामाय सर्वं प्रियं भवति। आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्य: श्रोतव्यो मन्तव्यो निदिध्यासितव्यो मैत्रेय्यात्मनो वा अरे दर्शनेन श्रवणेन मत्या विज्ञानेनेदॸसर्व विदितम्। </p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Behold, Maitreyī, not for the sake of the universe, the universe is dear, but for the sake of the Self, it is dear. This Self (tmā) is verily to be seen, heard, reflected and meditated upon. O Maitreyī, by seeing, hearing, meditating on and knowing the Self, all this (universe) is, comprehended.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Again,—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“O Maitreyī, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Kṣatriya</span>, the worlds, these gods, these elements, and whatever else there is in the universe, are the same as the Self.”</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Where (in the state of ignorance) there is duality, as it were there one sees another, smells another, hears another, salutes another, reflects on another and knows another. But to one for whom everything is tmā, who will smell whom by what, see whom by what, hear whom by what, salute whom by what, meditate on whom by what, and know whom by what? How should he know him by whom he knows this all? O Maitreyī, how should he know the knower?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus, the subject has been discussed in detail in Chapters II and IV of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Br̥hadāraṇyakaUpaniṣad</span>, a short summary of which has been given above in this article.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) God, the Supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, who is beyond the perishable, transient, illusory-objective world, and is formless, changeless, attributeless, eternal, Knowledge and Bliss solidified, is my soul or tmā, that is, the same as my Self; knowing thus the identity between himself and God, man realizes God. The <span class="char-style-override-10">śruti</span> says—</p>
<p class="Gadya">योऽकामो निष्काम आप्तकाम आत्मकामो न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति ब्रह्मैव सन् ब्रह्माप्येति।<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(<span class="char-style-override-10">Br̥hadāraṇyaka</span> IV. iv. 6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who does not desire, has no desires, is beyond desires, and whose desire is centred in the soul, where Great do not depart (from the body). Becoming <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, he attains Brahma.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to explain the secret of this truth, there appears a story in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Br̥hadāraṇyakaUpaniṣad</span>. Janaka, the King of the Videhas, once performed a sacrifice in which large gifts were given to Brāhmaṇas. In that connection, many <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas </span>from the Kuru and PāÛcāla countries assembled there. Desiring to know who among those <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas</span> was the best enlightened, he brought ten thousand cows from his stable, the horns of each of whom were ornamented with ten <span class="char-style-override-10">Padas </span>of gold, and addressing the <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas</span>, he said—“O venerable ones, whoever among you is the best knower of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, may take away these cows”. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas</span> heard this announcement of the king but none ventured to come forward. Then, YājÛavalkya ordered his disciples to drive away the cows. When the disciples of YājÛavalkya started doing so, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas</span> became angry, and Janaka’s Hotā Aśvala enquired, “Are you the only knower of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> among us?” YājÛavalkya replied, “I bow to him Who is the knower of Brahma; I am desirous of only getting the cows.” Hearing this, Aśvala, rtabhāga and Bhujyu put many questions to him one after another, and YājÛavalkya answered them all to their great satisfaction.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, Uṣasta, the son of Cakra, asked, “YājÛavalkya, do explain to me that Brahma, who is directly realizable, the soul, which is within every soul.” YājÛavalkya replied—</p>
<p class="Gadya">एष त आत्मा सर्वान्तर: कतमो याज्ञवल्क्य सर्वान्तरो य: प्राणेन प्राणिति स त आत्मा सर्वान्तरो योऽपानेनापानिति स त आत्मा सर्वान्तरो यो व्यानेन व्यानीति स त आत्मा सर्वान्तरो य उदानेनोदानिति स त आत्मा सर्वान्तर एष त आत्मा सर्वान्तर:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. iv. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It is thy soul, which is within everyone.” Uṣasta asked, “Which soul is within everyone ?” “That which breathes through breaths is thy soul, which is within every being. That which drives the life-wind downwards and out through the anus is thy soul, which is within every being. That which makes the life-wind function as the vital air that is diffused through the whole body, is thy soul which is within every being. That which makes the life-wind rise up the throat and enter the head is thy soul, which is within every being.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then, Uṣasta, again, asked, “Which soul is within every being?” YājÛavalkya replied again—</p>
<p class="Gadya">‘.....सर्वान्तर:। न दृष्टेर्द्रष्टारं पश्येर्न श्रुते: श्रोतारॸशृणुया न मतेर्मन्तारं मन्वीथा न विज्ञातेर्विज्ञातारं विजानीया:। एष त आत्मा सर्वान्तरोऽतोऽन्यदार्तं ततो होषस्तश्चाक्रायण उपरराम।’</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. iv. 2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“This thy soul is within every being. You cannot behold the beholder of the process of beholding; you cannot hear the hearer of the process of hearing; you cannot reflect on the thinker who carries on the process of thought; you cannot know the knower of the process of knowing. This thy soul is within every being—whatever is different from it is transient.” Hearing this, Uṣasta, the son of Cakra, became silent.</p>
<p class="Gadya">अथ हैनं कहोल: कौषीतकेय: पप्रच्छ याज्ञवल्क्येति होवाच यदेव साक्षादपरोक्षाद्‍ब्रह्म य आत्मा सर्वान्तरस्तं मे व्याचक्ष्वेत्येष त आत्मासर्वान्तर:। कतमो याज्ञवल्क्य सर्वान्तरो योऽशनायापिपासे शोकं मोहं जरां मृत्युमत्येति।<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. v. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Then, Kahola, the son of Kauṣītaka, asked, “Yāj×avalkya, do explain to me that directly realizable Brahma, which is the soul of every being.” YājÛavalkya replied, “It is your soul, which is within every being.” Kahola enquired, “Which soul, O YājÛavalkya, is within every being?” Thereupon, YājÛavalkya replied, “That which is beyond hunger, thirst, grief, delusion, old age and death, it is that your soul, which is within every being.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Then, Uddālaka, the son of Aruṇa, told YājÛavalkya, “If you are ignorant, O YājÛavalkya, of the Inner Ruler running as the Thread within all, and yet take away the cows which rightly belong to the knower of Brahma, your head will certainly drop down from your neck.” YājÛavalkya replied, “Verily I know that Inner Ruler running as the Thread within all.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O Gautama, the wind is that Thread. This world, the other world, and all beings are held together by the wind, as by a thread.” Agreeing with this, Uddālaka, now asked YājÛavalkya to explain the Inner Ruler.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">YājÛavalkya said—</p>
<p class="Gadya">‘य: पृथिव्यां तिष्ठन् पृथिव्या अन्तरो यं पृथिवी न वेद यस्य पृथिवी शरीरं य: पृथिवीमन्तरो यमयत्येष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृत:।’<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. vii. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who dwelling in the earth is within the earth, whom the earth does not know, whose body is the earth, who living within rules the earth, is your soul, the Inner Ruler, immortal.’’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Again—</p>
<p class="Gadya">‘अदृष्टो द्रष्टाश्रुत: श्रोतामतो मन्ताविज्ञातो विज्ञाता नान्योऽतोऽस्ति विज्ञातैष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतोऽतोऽन्यदार्तं ततो होद्दालक आरुणिरुपरराम।’<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(III. vii. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Unseen, He sees, unheard He hears, though beyond thought, He thinks, unknown He knows. That is your soul, the Inner Ruler, Immortal. Whatever is different from Him is perishable.” Hearing this, Uddālaka, the son of Aruṇa, become silent.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Then, Gārgī, the daughter of Vacaknu, and Vidagdha, the son of śakala, put many other questions, which were immediately answered by YājÛavalkya. In the end, addressing Vidagdha, YājÛavalkya said, “I shall now ask you about the Puruṣa in the Upaniṣads, and if you fail to explain Him to me, your head will fall off.” Vidagdha knew Him not, hence his head fell off.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Then, YājÛavalkya said, “O venerable <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas</span>, let anyone among you, who wishes it, question me; or I will question anyone among you, who desires it.” But the <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇas</span> dared not take up his challenge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to explain the secret of this truth, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Br̥hadāraṇyakaUpaniṣad</span> further said—</p>
<p class="Gadya">स वा एष महानज आत्माजरोऽमरोऽमृतोऽभयो ब्रह्माभयं वै ब्रह्माभयॸहि वै ब्रह्म भवति य एवं वेद।<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(IV. iv. 24)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“This great unborn tmā (soul), undecaying, immortal and fearless, is <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>; <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> is verily fearless; he who knows becomes verily the fearless <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is a short description of what constitutes the worship of attributeless <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, indication of the word “Thou,” beyond the external universe, which is the very same as Self.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through the careful practice of any of the forms of worship mentioned in this article, man can realize God. Firstly, as between dualistic and non-dualistic forms of worship, whatever course the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> chooses, he may start the practice either according to his own taste or comprehension, or under the instruction of some teacher; but if his goal is truly God-realization, whatever may be the sentiment he cultivates for the sake of his worship, he is bound in the end to realize God, for the final result of all the practices is one and the same. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, also, the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत्सांख्यै: प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकं सांख्यं च योगं च य: पश्यति स पश्यति॥</p>

Therefore, he who sees Sāṅkhyayoga and Karmayoga as one, so far as their result goes, really sees.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Again, it has been said—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Some by meditation behold the Self (<span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span>) in their own heart with the help of their pure reason; others by proceeding along the path of Knowledge, and others, again, by treading the path of Action.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All the practices, which have been described in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣad</span> and other scriptures bear the same fruit, that is, their final result is one and the same. This result is indescribable, and none can explain it in any way. It is much beyond whatever is described and explained.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">Thus the <span class="char-style-override-10">Saguṇa</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Nirguṇa</span> forms of worship of God, as dualistic and non-dualistic worship, have been discussed very briefly in this article. The subject of worship as described in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> is very extensive and very abstruse. Owing to shortness of space, only a bird’s eye-view of it has been given in this article. Cultured and inquisitive readers, who may desire to know the subject more in detail should themselves study the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>, and by properly reflecting on, and adopting the practices described in them, make their lives truly successful.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-7">Meditation on the Absolute</p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-8"><span class="char-style-override-21">SUBLATION OF THE PHENOMENAL</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">All that is objective is illusory, of the nature of a dream. Just as on waking from a dream no trace is left of the dream-world, the phenomenal has an absolute non-existence even more certain than that. In the eyes of him who has woken from a dream the dream-world persists in a conceptual form, or in other words it continues to exist as a mere concept. But to him who has woken into God-consciousness, i.e., realized God, the world ceases to exist even as a concept. For the mind and intellect in which the dream-world appeared persist even after one’s waking from the dream, with this difference that the dream-world no longer abides in them; that is why it is said to have a conceptual existence. Subsequent to God-realization, however, the mind and intellect, being products of Māyā (illusion), are left behind in this world of illusion. Hence this world is absolutely non-existent in the essential nature of God. But in the mind of the individual who is believed to have realized God the world exists as a dream—this is what the scriptures as well as the seekers of truth ever. Hence viewing this world as a mere illusion or as analogous to a dream or a mirage, a mere appearance having no reality whatsoever, the Sādhaka should banish it altogether from his mind, or in other words he should give up all thought of the world, should forget the world altogether.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A Hindī poet says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Free your mind from thoughts of the world, by whatever method it may be possible. Sublate the world, whether it be through devotion, knowledge or <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span>.”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>

<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">चाहे भक्ति चाहे ग्यान से, चाहे योग से खोय॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sum and substance of Advaita philosophy or the monistic doctrine is that beyond the one Divinity, who is truth, knowledge and bliss combined, nothing ever was or is. Realizing the absolute non-existence of this phenomenal world in the past, present and future, and even of these three divisions of time, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> should merge himself into the one eternal Divinity, who is solidified knowledge and bliss.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-8-1" xml:lang="en-US">THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF GOD</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> God is truth, knowledge and bliss combined. These three constitute the essential nature of God. They are no qualifications of God, because there is no distinction of qualifications of God, because there is no distinction of either; for God admits of no such difference as attribute and substratum. Nor again are they characteristics or distinguishing marks of God; for there is no such thing as distinguisher and distinguished in God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-8-2" xml:lang="en-US">THE TRUTH ASPECT</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To us Truth appears as a distinct entity. Consciousness as an altogether different entity and Bliss as a separate entity, but the truth is far from it. That which is real is conscious as well and that which is conscious is of the nature of bliss at the same time. To put it the other way, that which is conscious is also real and that which is real is of the nature of bliss as well. Or to put it in a third form, that which is of the nature of bliss is also conscious; and that alone is real, which is conscious at the same time. That which we hold as real is not in essence the same as God; for the essential nature of God is different from it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Now I shall speak to you at length about that which ought to be known, and knowing which one attains immortality; that beginningless supreme Brahma is said to be neither Sat (being) nor Asat (non-being).”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">A reality which can be grasped through the intellect is illusory; hence it is a product of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā </span>(illusion). A <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> undoubtedly succeeds in realizing God by viewing it as identical with Him, but in reality it is not the same as God; for the human intellect, being a product of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>, is incapable of comprehending God, who is beyond the realm of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>.

<p class="TEXT-English">Higher than the lights that are perceived through the senses of perception are those that are grasped through the intellect; that is to say, discrimination and knowledge are higher than physical light etc. Even higher than intellectual perception is the apprehension by the conscious self of a spiritual reality. For just as the intellect has knowledge of the eye and the objects perceived by the eye, but the eye cannot perceive the intellect or things comprehended by the intellect, even so the self knows the intellect as well as the objects perceived through intellect, but the intellect is incapable of knowing the self. All the same the self too, when it knows its own essential nature, knows it through a refined and sharpened intellect.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Kaṭhopaniṣad</span> says—</p>

The soul does exist, but it cannot be grasped; it is proof against decay; it does not decay; it is unattached, it does not cleave; it is unbound, it does not feel vexed or afflicted; it does not perish.

The Sāttvika form of joy which proceeds from spiritual practice is even higher than the latter; but the essential nature of God, which is characterized as all bliss, transcends all these. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span> form of joy is superior to that born of sleep, indolence etc., in so far as it is conscious whereas in the latter there is no consciousness at all. Again, the Rājasika type of joy arising from contact of the senses with their objects is momentary, transient and painful in consequence; whereas the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika </span>joy is comparatively more lasting and nectar-like in the end. Hence the Rājasika form of joy is worth rejecting when compared with the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika </span>joy resulting from spiritual practice. But even this latter type of joy proceeding from meditation on the spirit is of a lower order when looked at from the viewpoint of the essential nature of God. Hence even the Sāttvika joy is worth giving up when compared with God. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Of these <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva</span>, being immaculate, is illuminating and flawless; it binds through self-identification with joy and knowledge, O sinless Arjuna.”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Even the joy proceeding from meditation, limited as it is by time and space and enjoyable through the intellect, is material, finite and transient.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The knower or the subject is as a rule conscious, whereas the object of knowledge is material. Only that which is finite is capable of being known; and that which is finite is necessarily bound by time and space. God, however, is beyond time and space. Hence the blissful nature of God is extraordinary than all these.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Material joy is not cognized by itself, it is known by someone else. The joy, however, which is the essential nature of God is Self-conscious. It is not cognizable by others, hence it is conscious; and it is beyond the limits of time and space, hence it is eternal. But the real nature of God is entirely different from that which is thus understood. What has been described above is the nature of God qualified by the intellect. The nature of even such a God can be understood only through a refined and sharpened intellect. It is this nature of God which has been called supersensuous and comprehensible by the intellect. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“That in which the soul experiences the eternal and supersensuous joy which can be apprehended only through a refined and sharp intellect, and wherein established the said Yogī moves not from Truth on any account.”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">That reality of God cannot be described either through affirmation or through negation—nevertheless, if a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> follows a particular course of spiritual discipline with the object of attaining that which is aimed at and discussed by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and other scriptures, he succeeds in realizing God even as one is able to locate the new moon with the help of the bough of a tree—<span class="char-style-override-14">शाखाचन्द्रवत्</span>. Suppose anyone catches sight of the new moon and wants to show it to another who is unable to locate it. The former takes the help of a bough of a tree appearing close to the moon and tells his companion that the moon stands just four inches above the bough. He tells a third person that the moon appears exactly beside the corner of a particular roof. Really speaking, both these descriptions are wrong; yet they enable the other fellows to discover the moon. Even so a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> who strives for God-realization following a particular path pointed out to him as leading to God and with his eyes fixed on what has been described to him as God succeeds in realizing Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The various descriptions of God such as God with form and without form, God with attributes, and without attributes, God as manifest, and unmanifest, are all correct as well as incorrect at the same time. They are correct in so far as those who strive for God-realization with their eyes fixed on Him as described by saints and holy men, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and other scriptures, are enabled to realize Him. And they are incorrect in the sense that really speaking God is entirely different from what He has been described to be; for words fail to describe the real nature of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">Hence those who meditate on God without form should strive diligently with their eyes fixed on God as described in the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>, no matter what method they follow.

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-9">Meditation on the All-Blissful Aspect of God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Squatting in a secluded place, which is free from dirt and other impurities, in a steady and easy posture, one should meditate on God as follows. There is no spiritual discipline as good as meditation in the world. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">संकल्पप्रभवान् कामांस्त्यक्त्वा सर्वानशेषत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनसैवेन्द्रियग्रामं विनियम्य समन्तत:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">शनै: शनैरुपरमेद् बुद्‍ध्या धृतिगृहीतया।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मसंस्थं मन: कृत्वा न किंचिदपि चिन्तयेत् ॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">       (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> VI. 24-25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Completely renouncing all desires arising from thoughts of the world, and fully restraining the whole pack of the senses from all sides by the mind, he should through gradual practice attain tranquillity; and fixing the mind on God through reason controlled by steadfastness, he should not think of anything else.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God has been characterized as All-truth, all-consciousness and infinite—<span class="char-style-override-15">‘</span><span class="char-style-override-14">सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म</span><span class="char-style-override-15">’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Taittirī</span><span class="char-style-override-10">ya Upaniṣad</span> II.i.1). God is all-conscious. The whole of this universe is comprised in the idea of that all-conscious God. If He were to give up the idea of the world, the one All-conscious God alone would remain. There are three categories in world—viz., (1)<span class="char-style-override-10"> JÛāta</span>, (2) <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span> and (3) <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛeya</span>. Of these, the <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛeya</span> are unconscious, the JÛāta alone being conscious. That which is capable of being known is called <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛeya</span> (the knowable); the instrument of knowledge is called “<span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span>” (the means of knowledge) and the knowing subject is the <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāta</span>. The object as well as the means of knowledge depend on the knower. The means as well as the object of knowledge—these are all assumed. Even as the dream-world is only assumed, it has no real existence, it is a mere idea, so this visible universe too is a mere idea. If, on the other hand, it does exist, it should not perish; for the Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सत:।<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (II. 16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The unreal has no existence, and the real does not cease to be.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But all objects are perishing before our very eyes. Because of this perishable nature they are all transient; and, being transient, they do not really exist, are mere ideas or fictitious. That which ideates them is the conscious substance and that is the soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The soul is conscious by nature; and that alone which is conscious constitutes bliss. Of course, consciousness is cognized by us, but not so bliss; for the soul being associated with “<span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span>” and “<span class="char-style-override-10">JÛeya</span>”, its true nature is veiled. Even as the sun, though consisting of a huge mass of light, is not perceived when screened by clouds, so the soul, even though conscious by nature, is not cognized due to its being veiled by ignorance. The soul is a ray of the Oversoul. Hence from the monistic point of view the soul and the Oversoul are one. The veiling is only subjective, a mere idea. When this is negated, the one God remains.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God exists. He is great, infinite, unbounded, conscious, and consisting of knowledge, cognition and bliss. One should meditate on these lines. God is uniformly present everywhere—above and below, inside as well as outside this universe consisting of mobile and immobile creation. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बहिरन्तश्च भूतानामचरं चरमेव च।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">     (XIII. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“It exists without and within all beings, and constitutes the animate and inanimate creation as well.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as the sky is unmanifest and formless, God too is unmanifest and formless. Really speaking, however, the sky stands no comparison with God; for, while the sky is material (unconscious) and void, God is conscious and bliss solidified. That is why they speak of God as truth, consciousness and bliss crystallized. By calling Him truth we only mean that He exists. “Conscious” means that which consists of knowledge or cognition. That conscious entity in itself is bliss. Hence He is spoken of as consciousness and bliss condensed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The aforesaid bliss is of the nature of never-ending happiness. That happiness, again, is known to that all-blissful God alone. Hence that all-blissful God is characterized as consisting of bliss. That bliss itself is consciousness and that consciousness itself is bliss. The idea is that the said bliss is known to none else; that all-blissful God alone is conscious of His own existence. Such is the nature of God, who is spiritual in essence and bliss solidified. Nothing exists beyond that one divine essence. In other words, the world has no reality apart from God. Entirely forgetting the world in this way, one should cease to entertain any idea whatsoever. Meditation on that <span class="char-style-override-10">Nirguṇa </span>and formless God consists of this alone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A man treading the path of devotion should fell this  tree of mundane life with the axe of strong dispassion. In other words, he should forget the world and empty the mind of all thoughts by dint of dispassion. And the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> following the path of knowledge should look upon the world as an empty dream and altogether negate it. The world impinges on our vision even though it has no reality. It appears as real because of its being an idea of God; in fact, it has no reality whatsoever. The world would dwindle into nothingness if God were to give up this idea.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> should picture to his mind that God has given up the idea of the world and that the entire universe has vanished of its own accord. God alone now remains. Nothing and none exists apart from that absolute and formless Reality, consisting of truth, consciousness and bliss crystallized. That bliss is spiritual bliss, unmixed and absolute bliss, bliss and bliss alone. There is no entity apart from that bliss. In this way one should meditate on that All-blissful God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> following the path of knowledge coupled with Devotion should picture to his mind that while God has given up the idea of the entire universe, he alone persists in His idea. Since he is engrossed in the thought of God, the latter too is thinking of him; for the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (Gītā IV. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, howsoever men seek Me, even so do I approach them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When God ceases to think of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, God alone will remain in his place too; for God alone has existed forever and everywhere from time immemorial. The word “everywhere” brings in the notion of space. That space too exists in the idea of God; really speaking, there is no space in God. The observation that God is eternally present is expressive of time. This time as well exists in the idea of God. As a matter of fact, God is beyond space and time. The consciousness of time and space that persists during the period of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span>” (spiritual discipline), being an idea of God, is no other than God; in fact, there is no entity other than God. The one undifferentiated <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> alone exists.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While practising meditation, we should repeatedly urge on our mind that God is present on all our sides. By us we mean our body. In other words, we should feel that God is present all round our body. In fact, the body does not exist at all; God alone exists in place of it. Just as there is the sky and sky alone on every side of a cloud, God alone exists on every side of our body. As a matter of fact, the cloud springs up from and gets dissolved in the sky alone. Hence the cloud has no existence apart from the sky. Similarly there is no entity apart from God. The body and God stand in the same relation to each other as the cloud and the sky. Really speaking, however, the sky stands no comparison with God, who is all consciousness and all bliss; while the sky is material and unconscious. Consciousness is the same as bliss and bliss is identical with consciousness. Hence the two are no separate entities. It is in order to distinguish the aforesaid bliss from worldly joy that we say such bliss is transcendental, unearthly, unique and spiritual, that it is the same as consciousness or knowledge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That All-blissful God is perfect in Himself—that is why He is spoken of as “perfect bliss”. Because He is unbounded, we characterize Him as “unbounded joy”. Since He is all-tranquil, we refer to Him as “tranquil joy”. That bliss is most compact and voluminous; it has no room for any other substance. Hence it is spoken of as “solid bliss”. It is unvarying and unremittent; hence it is known as “constant bliss”. It continues for ever; hence it is called “perpetual bliss”. It never ceases to be and exists in reality; hence it is designated as “real bliss.” The bliss in question is conscious; hence it is referred to as “conscious bliss” or “bliss identical with knowledge”. It uniformly extends everywhere—above and below, outside as well as inside; hence it is spoken of as “uniform bliss”. It cannot be conceived by any—is beyond the scope of the intellect; hence it is designated as “bliss inconceivable”. To know it is to recognize that it is beyond conception. As a matter of fact, the essential character of God is altogether different from the all-conscious and All-blissful God conceived by us; from that which forms the object of our conception. That alone which is united with the intellect is conceived through the intellect. Hence it is <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> qualified by reason that comes to be conceived by us. In other words, that alone which is capable of being grasped with the intellect is conceived by means of the intellect. That is why the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā </span>characterizes it as <span class="char-style-override-15">‘बुद्धिग्राह्यम्’</span>—so subtle that it can be comprehended with the intellect alone (VI. 21).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The aforesaid bliss is great indeed; hence it is spoken of as “great bliss.” It is the highest of all; hence it is characterized as “supreme bliss.” It is conscious by nature; hence it is designated as “spiritual bliss.” A striver should remain constantly and uninterruptedly merged in the All-blissful God referred to above.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the course of meditation a striver should mentally repeat the following ideas in his mind and actually feel like that;—“Oh, what ineffable peace is reigning all round! There is nothing but peace. God alone is becoming manifest in the form of peace. Oh, how profuse is the light of knowledge spreading all round! There is enlightenment  and enlightenment alone. Nothing but enlightenment. God alone is being revealed in the form of enlightenment. Oh, how unspeakable is the consciousness that is being experienced! There is nothing but consciousness. God alone is manifesting Himself in the form of consciousness. Oh, what ineffable joy! We find that joy and joy alone pervades our mind, intellect, senses and body, inside, as well as outside. In other words, the All-blissful God alone is visibly permeating every pore of our body, nay, every atom of our being, the form of our body being a mere idea. Really speaking, joy and joy alone manifests itself through it. That bliss alone stands manifested in the form of peace. That bliss alone is revealed in the form of knowledge and that bliss alone is perceived in the form of consciousness. All these are no more than synonyms of joy. In fact, they all represent the one All-blissful Divinity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">How blissful! Oh, what a bliss! What a joy! Integral Bliss! Unbounded Bliss! Tranquil Bliss! Solid Bliss! Constant Bliss! Eternal Bliss! Conscious Bliss! Supreme Bliss! Great Bliss! Never-ending Bliss! Inconceivable Bliss! Absolute Bliss! Unmixed Joy! OË! Peace! Peace!! Peace!!!<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-10">Intensity of Spiritual Practice</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as the process of respiration goes on without interruption and knows no pause, the striving for God-realization should continue day and night without remission. He who is incessantly and habitually engaged in adoration and meditation is sure to attain blessedness. For the Lord Himself says in corroboration of this truth—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावित:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> VIII. 6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, thinking of whatever entity one leaves the body at the time of death, that and that alone one attains, being ever absorbed in its thought”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, the Lord goes on to declare that He is easily accessible to him who is constantly engrossed in His thought.</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनन्यचेता: सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यश:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं सुलभ: पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिन:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> VIII. 14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the couple of verses immediately preceding the above, the Lord has already indicated the means of controlling the senses, the mind and the vital airs. Such a practice can very well be pronounced as exceedingly difficult; <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogīs</span> alone can undertake it. As for constant remembrance of God, anyone and everyone can practise it. “Think of Me at all times and fight,”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span> says the Lord.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-6">* मामनुस्मर युध्य च।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Of course steadfastness is most essential for carrying on this practice. If a man does not succeed in realizing God during his lifetime even through diligent practice, he is sure to do so at the last moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mind, speech and body—all these three should be employed in carrying on one’s Sādhana. The body should be employed in rendering service to others, the mind should be devoted to meditation and the organ of speech should be employed in muttering the Divine Name. No action should be performed with the motive of attaining worldly objects; everything should be done as a duty (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> II. 47). Whenever the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> is reminded of God, he should take it as a great favour of God and should feel transported with joy. Similarly he should bitterly rue the moment when God slips out of his memory, and should shudder to think what a sorry plight he would have been reduced to had he met his end that very moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We should go in for all-round improvement. If we visit a temple, we should entertain a very high notion of the image enshrined therein. We should look upon the latter as superior to the decorations surrounding it. Mental worship is more valuable than external worship. Therefore, installing a mental image of the Deity in the heart, one should go on worshipping it with articles of one’s own imagination. This practice should continue at all times and one should get absorbed in it. One should repeatedly remember the divine virtues of God, such as compassion, forbearance, equanimity, impartiality and so on.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One should contemplate on the loving nature, and glory of God. As a lover God has no compeer. As for glory, whatever there is glorious, brilliant and powerful, should be regarded as a spark of the Lord’s glory (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> X. 41). Thus perceiving His glory in everything one should offer praises and prayer to Him and meditate on Him. Of these three practices, again, meditation is the most valuable. When there is no one equal to God, how can anyone excel Him. A <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> should offer praises to Him on the above lines. He should only pray that he may remain ever engrossed in His sweet thought and rememberance and may ever continue to behold His divine sports. It should, however, be noted in this connection that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmalīlā</span> that we witness is only an external imitation of śrī Rāma’s divine play. In the same way we should select all the <span class="char-style-override-10">Līlās</span> depicted in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmacaritamānasa</span>, for instance, meditate on them and behold them with our mental eyes. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Caupāīs</span> bearing on those beautiful episodes should be memorized in order to facilitate meditation on and mental perception of the divine sports. This constitutes an excellent and easy way of practising meditation and fixing the mind on God. A large proportion of man’s time is being constantly frittered away in idle thought. On his addressing himself to this practice, however, the mind gets a good occupation by way of reflection and contemplation. This constitutes the most remarkable feature of this practice.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mind should be kept fully engaged in such pursuits, it should be allowed no respite for indulging in any other thought. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmāyaṇa</span> and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhāgavata</span> should form the constant objects of his study. Turning away from other vain pursuits of the livelong day, one should remain engaged in such occupations only.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The main obstacle which slackens our practice, which arrests the progress of our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>, is our attraction for sense-objects. Hence we should carefully eliminate our attachment to worldly objects. Viewing the world and its objects as perishable, ephemeral and sorrowful, we should divert our mind from them and cultivate dispassion. Repeated practice and dispassion are the only means of subduing the mind. Even if it is urged that the generality of men do not feel inclined to undertake such practices, we for our part should take to them without fail, minding not what others do.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span> should note one thing more in this connection, viz., that human nature has an innate tendency to lapse into sin. That is why an attempt to encourage the demoniac propensities in men begins to bear fruit immediately, whereas the noble and good work of popularizing the divine virtues bristles with great difficulties. Realizing this he should be ever vigilant and should not waste a single moment. He should never remain idle. An empty mind falls an easy victim to error, sloth and other vices. Hence so long as the mind does not get emptied of worldly thoughts and fixed on God, there is grave risk for him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One should raise a crop of the Divine Name. The Divine Name is the seed which should be sown in the soil of the heart. The thought-current of the mind represents water. This thought-current is ever flowing in the direction of the ocean of worldly existence. Stemming its flow in that direction the field of the heart has to be irrigated thereby as a field of paddy. Even as the flow of the mind is diverted from that channel and directed towards this field, the latter will begin to thrive. A field of paddy requires an abundant supply of water. It gets dry if we cease watering it. But the field of which we are speaking here never gets dry; that is the speciality of it. Nevertheless the process of watering it should never be discontinued. We should go on watering it all times. That is our paramount duty. And when there is no occupation higher than this, what else should be done. This alone should be persevered in.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through this process of continually watering the field when the tiny plants of paddy get mature and are crowned with ears, or in other words, as we begin to develop a taste for adoration of God, association with holy men, meditation, dispassion and self-abnegation etc., the field should be scrupulously guarded against destructive birds in the shape of lust, anger, honour and fame etc. Extra vigilance is needed at this stage. We should always be on our guard lest we may be lost in their lovely and sweet warbling, and our ripening crop may be destroyed by them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For quickening the speed of our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana </span>disinterestedness is most efficacious. This latter ensures speedy success. We have grown very selfish; that is why we are not making rapid progress in our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>. In every matter and at every step we are guided by self-interest. If we get something from the market for our family consisting of say, five members, we shall feel inclined to have the best of the lot for ourselves. If our property is partitioned, we shall try to appropriate the better share. While travelling by rail we try to secure a more comfortable seat for ourselves. Although we soar high in our professions, our eyes, like those of a vulture, are directed towards nasty things. This accounts for our abject degeneration. Hence we can gain much if we attend to our worldly duties in a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">A man of scanty means should not imagine that only moneyed men can practise self-denial and that he is incapable of it. Had it been so, God-realization would be open to the wealthy alone. In the majority of cases, however, the reverse only is true. The more material resources one possesses, the more self-centred he is. Taking note of the above facts, therefore, everyone should improve one’s <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> and accelerate its progress.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-11">God-realization through Intense Longing</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How can we see the Lord at the earliest possible moment? Our reply to this question is that if we develop faith in our heart, there will be no delay in seeing Him. One should have faith in one’s mind that “God exists, that he who longs for a sight of the Lord is sure to meet Him, that many people have seen Him in the past, that people see Him even today and will continue to do so in future as well. Why should I, then, remain deprived of His sight ?” He who comes to develop this kind of faith will not rest till he has seen God. His sleep as well as appetite will take leave of Him. A number of friends, both men and women, betake themselves to ¤Rṣikeṣa for the annual <span class="char-style-override-10">Satsaṅga</span> in the hope that they will return this time only after realizing God. But they did so on many an occasion in the past, but returned without realizing their ambition. This has led them to believe that even though they harbour such a feeling in their heart, there is little hope of their seeing God. As we believe, so we realize. That is why such people fail to see God and return empty-handed. He who is firm in his belief that the Lord will surely meet him cannot but see the Lord. Prince Bharata was positive in his belief that śrī Rāma would surely meet Him. In the words of Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa, he says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मोरें जियँ भरोस दृढ़ सोई।</p>
<p class="Shlok"> मिलिहहिं राम सगुन सुभ होई॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I have firm belief in my heart that śrī Rāma will surely meet me. The omens too are propitious.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This conviction is based on the tender disposition of the Lord. Bharata continues to say—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जौं करनी समुझै प्रभु मोरी।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नहिं निस्तार कलप सत कोरी॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन अवगुन प्रभु मान न काऊ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">दीन बंधु अति मृदुल सुभाऊ॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“If the Lord were to consider my doings, there would be no redemption for me even after a thousand million <span class="char-style-override-10">Kalpas</span> (cycles). But the Lord never takes into account the faults of His devotees, a friend of the afflicted and most tender-hearted as He is.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Still, if he does not succeed in seeing the Lord, he says —</p>
<p class="Shlok">बीतें अवधि रहहिं जौं प्राना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अधम कवन जग मोहि समाना॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“If however, my life lingers even after the expiry of the term of His exile, who would be so vile in this world as I.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In other words, he suggests that his life too will depart with the expiry of the term of śrī Rāma’s exile. He had, as a matter of fact, vowed that he would enter a blazing fire in case śrī Rāma did not return even after the expiry of the term of His exile. But such a course was not at all difficult; anyone could attempt it. Moreover, that would be tantamount to suicide. If, on the other hand, he actually loved the Lord, it would be impossible for him to survive without seeing the Lord. Till then his life hung on the hope of śrī Rāma’s return at the end of the term of His exile; but if He did not return even after that, it would be clear that he had no love for the Lord and that what he professed was a mere travesty of love. While he was musing this, Bharata was overcome with pangs of separation from the Lord. Says Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa—</p>
<p class="Shlok">राम बिरह सागर महँ भरत मगन मन होत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">बिप्र रूप धरि पवनसुत आइ गयउ जनु पोत॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The poet compares the vastness of the agony of separation from śrī Rāma to an ocean in which the mind of Bharata was just going to sink. In other words, Bharata was just on the verge of succumbing to his pangs of separation from the Lord, when Hanumān (son of the wind-god) appeared as a bark in the disguise of a <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa </span>and rescued him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What we seek to convey through this illustration is that if, on the analogy of Bharata, we too persuade ourselves that the Lord will surely meet us; nay, if we exert ourselves day and night with this end in view, fully determined to see Him at any cost, we are sure to behold him. When the Lord has revealed Himself in the past to thousands of devotees, whose stories are available in our scriptures and other books, it cannot be believed that the stories are all fictitious. When so many people have seen Him with their own eyes heretofore, we should rest assured that we too shall behold Him. If it is urged that we are not worthy of His sight, our reply is that the Lord does not as a rule appear before the deserving alone. Not only do the deserving behold Him; on the other hand, all those who have faith in His mercy are able to see Him, be they deserving or non-deserving or even undeserving. Let us cast a glance into the previous life of those who were blessed with His sight. For example, what sort of life did the celebrated devotee Bilvamaṅgala lead in the prime of his youth? Even Bāli, the monkey-chief of Kiṣkindhā, the elder brother of Sugrīva, whom Lord śrī Rāma Himself characterizes as a great sinner, was blessed by the Lord with His sight. Thus, the scope of His mercy is indeed very wide.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We should turn to account the supreme compassion that the Lord cherishes for all living beings—the dominant feeling of His heart towards us all. He who comes to know His true nature can no longer remain deprived of His realization. Lord śiva says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उमा राम सुभाउ जेहिं जाना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ताहि भजन तजि भाव न आना॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmacaritamānasa</span>)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who comes to realize the true nature of śrī Rāma, O Pārvatī, will not like any other pursuit than His adoration.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The Lord has a most tender disposition. Anyone who takes refuge in the Lord can realize Him, no matter if he is the worst sinner. The very thought of the Lord rids one of all sins. But men of an exalted nature do not worship the Lord with the motive of wiping out their sins. They hold that the adoration of the Lord is so very valuable and great that it should never be devoted to the cause of wiping out one’s sins. To stamp out one’s sins by means of adoration of the Lord is as preposterous as to crush stones by means of a diamond. Should a precious stone like diamond be devoted to the cause of crushing stones? That is why men of an exalted type worship God, not for the sake of wiping out their sins but with a view to develop love for the Lord, which is something supremely high. There is no comparison between the two. One’s stock of sins is automatically wiped out by the mere semblance of the Divine Name. Darkness can never stand in the face of the rising sun any more than ignorance can stand before the light of wisdom. Even so sin cannot stand the dazzling glory of the adoration of God. Anyone worshipping the sun-god with a view to securing his vision need not request him to disperse the mist of darkness. We would only pray—“Be good enough to reveal yourself before us.” If darkness persists even after that, we have no objection. We should likewise persist in our longing to see the Lord, no matter if our sins continue unbated and even if the Lord makes us reap their bitter fruit, which we shall be only to glad to do. Even if we are cast into hell as a punishment for our sins, we should not mind. We seek only to behold Him even in hell. We would rather see Him in hell; for in that case all the denizens of hell would have the chance of being redeemed in a body. It is the sight of the Lord, and not the annihilation of our sins, that we are concerned with.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We should never be deluded into the belief that the Lord will appear before us only when we get ripe for His sight. They who believe like that can be blessed with His sight in consonance with their belief only when they get qualified for it. But the divine law is quite the reverse of it. Whoever holds that “the Lord is supremely compassionate, that His mercy descends not only on the deserving, but even on the most undeserving; nay, whosoever holds that, judged by the standard of individual merit, he is not at all worthy, but from the point of view of the Lord’s kind disposition, His sacred vow of redeeming the fallen, His infinite mercy and unmotived love, not only he but even those more degraded than he, rather all of them, however debased they may be, are entitled to His realization, though unworthy of it,” is quite deserving in the Lord’s eye, though undeserving from the point of view of personal merit. Hence, one should never regard oneself as undeserving in the face of the Lord’s unbounded compassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the case of those who realize, are alive to the glory of His compassion, even their disqualification in the shape of unworthiness cannot stand in the way of their God-realization. On the strength of God’s compassion, he who firmly believes that he is sure to realize God this time stands every chance of realizing Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be urged here that although what has been stated above is quite true and one should undoubtedly persuade oneself like that, yet considering one’s sins and failings one is prone to throw the entire blame on one’s <span class="char-style-override-10">Prārabdha </span>(destiny) and remains deprived of His sight. Our reply to the objector is that such handicaps are of his own making. One should never allow one’s destiny to stand in the way of one’s God-realization. Destiny is no stumbling-block to God-realization. They alone who are blind to this truth lay the blame at the door of their evil destiny. As a matter of fact, unpropitious destiny can interfere with God-realization. If destiny could stand in the way of God-realization, none would be able to realize God before reaching the end of one’s destiny. This is, however, not the case.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One may ask here—How long does one take to realize God? Our reply to this question is that time is no determining factor in God-realization. Man can realize God in an instant if he comes to perceive His true character and unravel His mystery. Failing this, he may not be able to realize Him after years and years together. It may be asked here—“Is it on the strength of one’s personal endeavour or on the strength of God’s kind-heartedness that He can be realized? In other words, does God-realization depend on one’s own striving or on His loving and kindly disposition! Our reply to this is that it depends on self-endeavour in the case of the individual who believes that God will be realized through his or her own endeavour; whereas it depends on the kind-heartedness of God in the case of the aspirant who holds that God is the disinterested friend of all living beings and that he or she is one of such beings. The Lord proclaims in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (V. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Having known Me (in reality) as the disinterested friend of all created beings, My devotee attains peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord’s compassion and love unaccountably extends to all; hence He is the disinterested friend of all. He who takes refuge in the Lord with this belief can never remain deprived of God-realization, he is sure to attain God, who is of the nature of supreme and ineffable peace. Hence, the above assertion of the Lord is quite in order and in consonance with the scriptures.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is supremely compassionate and loving by nature. He cannot bear the sight of others, suffering and none can vie with Him, much less surpass Him, in requiting love. The Lord offers Himself to him who, conscious of the above secret, dedicates himself to the Lord. Tell me, who else than God is so benign and kind-hearted in the world?</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nowhere in the wide world can we find such a unique bargain. A multimillionaire cannot be expected to offer his all in return to a pauper who has offered his all to the multimillionaire. This type of magnanimity exists in God alone. The Lord knows that one’s own self is dearer to one than everything else. He says to Himself, “Lo, this man has offered his all to Me along with his very self. Now even if I offer My all to him in return, I cannot repay the obligation he has put Me under—for it is he who took the initiative in offering his all and I would only be reciprocating. I would have excelled him only if I took the lead. Hence, even though I reciprocate his friendly gesture, he would still be outstripping Me by virtue of the initiative he has taken.” In this way the supremely magnanimous Lord feels beholden to His devotee.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">There is one thing more worth noting in this connection. He who comes to realize the kind-heartedness of the Lord becomes kind-hearted himself; for kind-heartedness occupies a unique place in the disposition of the Lord. Realizing that it is entirely in one’s hand to mould one’s own disposition, he shapes his disposition according to the disposition of the Lord. The Lord now betakes Himself to him of His own accord; for he is a devotee of the Lord, acquainted with His virtues, glory, reality, mystery and disposition and because he cherishes supreme reverence for and integral faith in the Lord. How can the Lord remain aloof from such a loving devotee and how can such a loving devotee remain aloof from his beloved Lord ? The Lord says in the<span class="char-style-override-10"> Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">     (VI. 30)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who sees Me (the Universal Soul) present in all beings, and all beings existing within Me, never loses sight of Me, and I never lose sight of him.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who perceives ether in all and all in ether can never lose sight of ether. Even so how can he who sees God pervading everywhere as ether and sees all in God lose sight of Him and how can God lose sight of him either? On the other hand, they continue to behold each other at every time, and on every occasion. How enviable and exalted this position is ! The Lord can never evade the sight of a loving devotee who has grasped His truth and mystery. It is His reality that predominates in the path of knowledge; while it is His mystery that is uppermost in the path of devotion. The cowherdesses of Vraja knew the secret of the false appearance assumed by Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa to deceive them. They could easily make out that it was their beloved śrī Kr̥ṣṇa who appeared before them in the guise of a female companion. The mystery would thus be unravelled and śrī Kr̥ṣṇa would then reveal His identity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now let us consider the question once more as to how to realize God at the earliest moment. Once a man has developed the desire to see God at the earliest moment, the only means of realizing this ambition is to intensify the desire to the utmost degree. When the desire reaches the highest pitch, the Lord can no longer tarry. The Lord tarries in the case of him alone who brooks the delay. The Lord is postponing His visit to us only because we bear separation from Him. When our agony of separation from Him grows so acute that we cannot do without Him even for a moment, the Lord too will find it impossible to defer His visit to us even for a moment. The Lord will find Himself in the same plight to which we shall be reduced.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“We do at times grow restless for the Lord,” it may be contended; “does the Lord too become restless for us in those moments?” My reply is that He does grow restless as it were for us. By way of illustration let us take the case of Sītā, who actually grew restless for the Lord during her separation from Him. Now śrī Rāma too become restless for her as it were during that period. Judged from our standard His agony grew so acute that He actually addressed even trees and animals and asked them if they had seen His beloved spouse. Nay, he even raved as it were like a madman. As a matter of fact, however, the Lord does not actually go mad nor does He lose His balance of mind. Certainly He does outwardly behave like one distracted or whose mental equilibrium has been disturbed. He showed to the world that Sītā was as restless for Him as He was for her. When Lakṣmaṇa was pierced in the heart with a javelin on the battle-field of Laṅkā, the Lord began to rave in His agony at the impending loss of His beloved younger brother. By the aforesaid pastime of His the Lord showed to the world that Lakṣmaṇa could be reduced to a similar plight in his agony of separation from Him. The Lord began to lament and rave in a state of excitement the like of which Lakṣmaṇa would have experienced in his agony of separation from his divine Brother.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence, the best means of realizing God is to develop an intense longing to meet Him. In the event of our developing such longing the Lord cannot help meeting us. Adoration and meditation are not so efficacious in drawing the Lord to us as an intense longing to behold Him. When we find no rest without seeing Him, the Lord too will find no rest without seeing us. When both God and His devotee are restless to meet eachother, the more powerful of the two will be held more liable to take the initiative. We for our part are quite helpless in the matter, hence we are unable to approach the Lord. The Lord, on the other hand, is All-powerful, so He can certainly come to us. Say, for example, a friend of mine is seriously ill; as such he is unable to come to me. I can, however, go to him because I am physically fit. Nay, suppose my friend sends word to me saying that he is ill and therefore, unable to see me, but that he is all the same anxious to see me. Under such circumstances, if I have an iota of love in me, I shall do my level best to go to him at all events. But in spite of my best efforts it is not certain that I shall be able to see him; for we are altogether helpless and dependent on our destiny in this matter. The Lord, on the other hand, is absolutely independent, all-powerful, supremely compassionate and the disinterested friend of all. How can He, under such circumstances, tarry even for a moment ? But the deficiency in our faith and love must be supplied by us. Of course the Lord too can help us if we implore Him to bless us with reverence and love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We can meet the Lord if we love Him even as we love honour and praise, wife and children, wealth and body etc. Wealth etc., are material objects. It is we that seek them; they do not seek us. Moreover, their acquisition by us is dependent on our destiny and is therefore uncertain. God, however, is a conscious Being; He loves those that love Him and destiny too cannot stand in the way of our meeting Him. Therefore, the Lord surely meets those who are seized with an intense longing to see Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we persuade ourselves that the Lord will meet us even if our love for Him is scant, the most compassionate and supremely loving Lord can meet us in spite of our meagre love, overlooking our faults. Nay, the Lord meets even those who long to see Him under the belief that He takes into account neither our eligibility nor our love but only expects us to long for Him. Hence, we should develop an intense longing for the Lord—the same type of thirst as a greedy man has for money. All the endeavours of a greedy man are solely directed towards money, His mind is ever obsessed with the idea of money and money alone.<br/>He may not have the word “money” on his lips all the twenty-four hours; but his mind is ever seized with an insatiable thirst for money. Hence he is designated as a true worshipper of mammon. He can renounce his wife and children, his faith and duty, nay, even God for the sake of money. He is always found saying, “Money must be acquired at any cost, no matter if we get nothing else. Even so all the endeavours of a true devotee of God are directed solely towards God and the Lord surely meets him. It is therefore that Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कामिहि नारि पिआरि जिमि लोभिहि प्रिय जिमि दाम।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तिमि रघुनाथ निरंतर प्रिय लागहु मोहि राम॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“May You be ever so dear to me, O Rāma, as woman is dear to a lustful man, and as money is dear to the greedy, O Lord of the Raghus!”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord is sure to meet one who has developed such love for Him, He can meet us even if we have faith in and reverence for Him; for faith and reverence are the chief factors in His realization. Hence, he who develops the firm conviction that the Lord will undoubtedly meet him that very night will have no wink of sleep during that night; for he will expect Him every moment with supreme eagerness. If he falls asleep, he cannot be said to have faith in the possibility of His coming to him during the said night; for there are no hard and fast rules as to at what particular moment He will be coming. Therefore, he should naturally be on the tiptoe every moment. Even a devoted wife keenly awaits the arrival of her husband who has gone out during the daytime, if he does not return till late at night. The devotee who expects the Lord in the course of a particular night awaits Him even more eagerly than that devoted wife. The aforesaid wife does fall asleep sometimes; for her husband often comes back and at times he does not. A devotee of the Lord, however, gets no sleep; for he expects him every moment and keeps himself ready to offer worship and pay homage to Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a high official or any other venerable personage or honourable guest or some esteemed friend visits our house, we keep things ready for his use even before his arrival. Similarly a devotee expecting the Lord keeps articles such as sandalpaste, flowers, incense and food ready for His worship and his heart overflows with enthusiasm and joy at the prospect of His arrival. The enthusiasm of a devoted wife who receives information about her husband returning from abroad that very night knows no bounds. A lover of the Lord is even more enthusiastic; for there is nothing so valuable as God. Intense longing is therefore the only requisite for God-realization; no other spiritual discipline is called for. Longing automatically draws out what little discipline is necessary; no other independent discipline is required.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a fish is taken out of water, it is seized with an insatiable thirst for water. It writhes without water and is unable to forget it. If we are similarly seized with an intense longing for the Lord and grow impatient to meet Him, the Lord will be compelled to appear before us that very moment. If there is no such thirst and uneasiness in us and if we but develop the constancy and eagerness of the Cātaka bird, even then we can realize God. A Cātaka would never stoop to drink water lying on the ground, no matter if it is the water of the holy <span class="char-style-override-10">Gaṅgā</span>; it would quench its thirst only with rain-drops falling from above. Such isits wonderful constancy. The Lord too maintains the life of the Cātaka by pouring showers from above. Just visualize the state of mind of a Cātaka. When clouds begin to rumble in the sky, the Cātaka feels enraptured as it were. Even if there is a hail-storm and the wings of the Cātaka get injured by pellets of hail, the bird unflinchingly endures it and eagerly looks forward to a delightful shower. Even so if a devotee pants to see the Lord, the latter is sure to appear before him and bless him with His transcendent vision. If we fail to develop the ideal constancy of this strange bird, let us imitate the ways of the Cakora bird, which is noted for its love for the moon. The Cakora, it is traditionally believed, rivets its eyes on the full moon as soon as it perceives it. If we likewise fix our eyes on a mental image of the Lord and get absorbed in that exhilarating vision, the Lord will feel compelled to meet us and bless us with His divine presence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Let us emulate in this behalf the lofty example of the celebrated sage Sutīkṣṇa figuring in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmacaritamānasa </span>of Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa. When Sutīkṣṇa got absorbed in the loving thought of śrī Rāma, the Lord manifested Himself first in his heart and then before his eyes too. And if we develop the loving attitude of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gopīs</span>, there can be nothing like it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, we should spare no pains to develop exclusive love and supreme reverence for the Lord, who eagerly awaits the blessed hour when love illumines our heart and He gets a suitable opportunity to take possession of it. We only profess our love and reverence for the Lord. But the Lord, who indwells all hearts, knows how sincere we are in our profession. Where there is genuine love and reverence for the Lord, the Lord does not lag behind in manifesting Himself. When the electric installation in a house is complete in every respect, there can be no delay in illuminating it. Even so, the Lord reveals Himself as soon as genuine love and reverence appear in our heart. All our unworthiness forthwith disappears and we are no longer regarded as unfit for His sight. Love and reverence are the only requisites for God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We attend religious discourses, enjoy the company of saints and godmen and follow a prescribed course of spiritual discipline under the belief that God-realization will take place sooner or later as a sequel to our spiritual practice. We, however, do not believe that the Lord is going to meet us this very moment. God-realization is really difficult for him who feels that judging by his record of past and present actions it is difficult for him to realize God. But the Lord surely meets him who feels in his heart of heart that the Lord has an extremely tender disposition and that He will undoubtedly see him in order to justify His own kind disposition. He who persuades himself that the Lord will surely meet him will be filled with enthusiasm and will find his life transforming every moment and his love for the Lord growing from more to more.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As has been pointed out above, the acquisition of all worldly things is doubtful; for it depends on one’s destiny, and because they are insentient. But an unpropitious destiny does not stand in the way of God-realization and there is no one so merciful and loving as God. Therefore, to entertain doubt about one’s meeting the Lord betrays total ignorance of His disposition and glory. A little thought would reveal that as a matter of fact meeting with none is so easy as that with the Lord. None of the created beings, whether animate or inanimate, possesses a disposition similar to the Lord’s and inanimate objects can have no desire to meet us. They can be had only through one’s <span class="char-style-override-10">Prārabdha</span> (destiny).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The entire stock of compassion in this world taken together would hardly equal a single drop of the ocean of mercy that God is. So supremely comely compassionate is He. He is an inexhaustible storehouse of compassion, love and other virtues. Our love is insignificant as compared to His, which is immeasurable. Our knowledge of the true significance and secret of love is negligible as compared to His. It is sheer folly on our part to accuse such a God of delaying His visit to us. It is lack of love and reverence on our part which is responsible for delaying His visit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Fancy couple of individuals loving each other, one of them being a mediocre Lover and the other an extraordinary one. The ordinary lover can afford to remain without his beloved. But how can the other, who knows in a special degree the true meaning and secret of love, tarry and help seeing his beloved? God is omnipotent and the inner controller of all. Hence, as has been pointed above, it is lack of love and reverence on our part which is responsible for delaying the Lord’s visit to us.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, let us strengthen our conviction that God exists and that He meets those who are anxious to meet Him. It is love alone that counts in His eyes. Intense longing to meet Him in all that is required. A thirsty man longing for water may or may not get water; for that depends on his destiny. The Lord, however, is sure to meet us if we have an ardent desire to see Him. When a man feels thirsty, he is put in mind of water again and again. He does not deliberately recall it; on the other hand, he cannot forget it due to his agonizing thirst. Similarly when thirst for God appears in us, He will automatically continue in our thought. The Lord surely meets him who remembers God in the same way as a thirsty man longing for water recalls water. Just as a hungry man is automatically reminded of food again and again, similarly, when we hunger for the Lord, He will automatically be remembered by us. But when there is no hunger for Him, how can He meet us? He who is running temperature loses his appetite due to that fever. In our case unbelief and impiety and impurity of mind occasioned by our past sins is the threefold fever which has dulled our appetite. The appetite of a man suffering from disinclination for food is roused only when he consults a physician and takes some medicine, an appetizing powder or digestive pills and so on, under his expert advice. In our case saints and godmen are physicians to be consulted and the scriptures are the standard books on medicine to be referred to. And the practice of Devotion consisting in the repetition of the Divine Name, meditation on His divine Form and action for his sake is the unfailing remedy. Just as the use of medicine is calculated to rouse one’s appetite, the practice of adoration and medicine and action for the sake of God is expected to rouse our appetite, i.e., to intensify our desire to see God. One feels inclined to undertake such practice by cultivating the fellowship of saints and godmen or where this is not possible by pursuing the study of sacred books. If we hear discourses on the excellence, glory, truth and secret of God from the lips of His devotees or read their accounts in sacred books and put faith in them, we can no longer help seeing God. The Lord is delaying His visit to us only so long as we bear separation from Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">Therefore, we should constantly practise <span class="char-style-override-10">Nāma-Japa</span> and meditation, cultivate the fellowship of saints and holy men and pursue the study of holy books and undertake action for the sake of God in a disinterested spirit with reverence and devotion.<span></span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Ahiṁsā</span>—Total abstinence from <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span> or injury to any living being in any form constitutes <span class="char-style-override-10">Ahiṁsā</span>. Evils like <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span> (violence) have been classified under various heads. First of all <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā </span>has been classified under three categories: (1) <span class="char-style-override-10">Kr̥ta </span>(done) (2) <span class="char-style-override-10">Kārita </span>(get done)<span class="char-style-override-10"> </span>and (3) <span class="char-style-override-10">Anumodita </span>(abetment). An injury inflicted by one’s own self is known as <span class="char-style-override-10">Kr̥ta</span>; that which is caused through the instrumentality of another falls under the category of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Kārita</span>”; while “<span class="char-style-override-10">Anumodita</span>” <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span> consists in countenancing its perpetration by another who does it of his own accord. All these three types of <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span> are actuated by greed, anger or folly. In this way <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span> can be subdivided under nine categories. Violence committed from some selfish motive is spoken of as actuated by greed; that which is motivated by hatred or malice has anger at its back; while that, which is committed through ignorance is actuated by folly. This ninefold violence can be further divided into twenty-seven types when classified again as <span class="char-style-override-10">Mr̥du</span> (mild), <span class="char-style-override-10">Madhya</span> (moderate), or <span class="char-style-override-10">Adhimātra </span>(excessive). A simple injury falls under the category of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Mr̥du</span>” <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span>, a grievous injury can be termed as “<span class="char-style-override-10">Madhya</span>” <span class="char-style-override-10">Hiṁsā</span>; while a fatal injury constitutes what they call “<span class="char-style-override-10">Adhimātra</span>” Hiṁsā. Similarly, there are many more categories of violence.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">But if anyone refrains from homicide or cowslaughter but commits violence upon other species of living beings, his non-violence is only partial. Similarly, that non-violence is also partial which is observed only at sacred places but not elsewhere. In the same way if anyone practises violence on other days but abstains from it on a Saṅkrānti day (the day on which the sun passes from one zodiacal sign to another), the day of a solar or lunar eclipse and on other sacred days, such non-violence too is partial. Likewise, if someone does not practise violence except on the occasion of a wedding, funeral and so on, his non-violence too is only partial and not absolute or universal. Universal non-violence is only that which is observed irrespective of any species of living beings, place, time or occassion, <span class="char-style-override-10">i.e.,</span> which eschews violence completely. Therefore universal violence excludes all violence, whether mental, vocal or physical and perpetrated against any living being knowingly, unknowingly or through listlessness in anyway and in any measure at any time or place and on any account.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As in the case of violence, lying, theft, copulation and acquisition of material possessions too should be considered as capable of being classified under similar heads.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Satya</span>—To relate an occurrence, to represent a situation or reproduce a talk precisely as it was observed, heard or understood without reserving or adding anything and without an effort to convey a different sense in spite of a faithful reproduction—such artless veracity of speech constitutes <span class="char-style-override-10">Satya </span>or Truthfulness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Telling a lie and instigating or encouraging anyone to tell a lie from greed, anger or folly in a slight, moderate or excessive degree—all this constitute a falsehood. Therefore, to make it a point never to tell a lie nor to instigate or encourage anyone to do so at any place, for any reason in the slightest degree, nor to give a false hint, nor to behave falsely or even to make a false resolve—in other words, to eschew all these varieties of falsehood for good and in everyway constitutes what goes by the name of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Satya</span>” or Truthfulness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Asteya</span>—To make it a point never to appropriate to oneself any movable or immovable property such as land or soil, house, money, cattle etc., through mendacity, deceit, perfidy, fraud, violence or any other means constitutes “Asteya” or non-thieving.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thieving or instigating or encouraging anyone to commit theft from greed, anger or folly in a small, moderate or large measure—all this constitutes theft. Therefore, to make it a point never to thieve nor to instigate or encourage anyone to commit a theft of any category at any place on any account through mind, speech or body in any measure constitutes what goes by the name of “Asteya” or non-thieving.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Brahmacarya</span>—(Continence) Abstinence on the part of a man from passionately looking at, talking with, touching the person of, remaining closetted with, remembering, hearing the voice of or cutting jokes with a woman, indulging in sexual commerce and having any other contact with her constitutes what goes by the name of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmacarya</span>”. <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmacarya</span> on the part of a woman similarly excludes of these acts in relation to a man.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To indulge in coition and instigate or encourage anyone to do so from greed, anger or folly constitutes a stigma on <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmacarya</span>. Therefore, abstinence from indulging in any indecent practice with the hand or any other part of the body with reference to any human being or animal etc., at any place on any account and in anyway in the slightest degree and a vow not to use obscene language or even too harbour obscene thoughts in one’s mind or make an obscene gesture or incite or encourage anyone to do so all this constitutes the observance of “Universal <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmacarya</span>”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Aparigraha</span>—Refraining from acquiring with the intention of enjoyment, movable or immovable property in the form of luxuries and wealth, house, cattle etc., beyond what is barely necessary to keep one’s body and soul together constitutes what goes by the name of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Aparigraha</span>”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“<span class="char-style-override-10">Parigraha</span>” consists in hoarding luxuries from greed, anger and folly in a small, moderate or large measure or inciting or encouraging others to do so. Therefore, refraining from hoarding or inciting or encouraging anyone to hoard even in a small measure any object of sense-enjoyment or any movable or immovable property on any account at any time or place in anyway, and making it a point not to ask anything of anybody or even crave for, or throw a hint about, anything—this constitutes what goes by the name of “Aparigraha”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Niyamas</span>—<span class="char-style-override-10">śauca</span> (Purity), <span class="char-style-override-10">Santoṣa </span>(Contentment), <span class="char-style-override-10">Tapas</span> (Askesis), <span class="char-style-override-10">Swādhyāya </span>(Scriptural Study) and <span class="char-style-override-10">ºśwara-Praṇidhāna </span>(Surrender to God)—these five are known by the name of <span class="char-style-override-10">Niyamas</span>.<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span> Let us consider them separately now.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">śauca</span> (Purity)—Purity is of two kinds—(1) external and (2) internal. External purity is subdivided into two categories—(i) <span class="char-style-override-10">śaucācāra </span>(cleanliness of body) and (ii) <span class="char-style-override-10">Sadācāra</span> (purity of conduct). Cleanliness consists in cleaning the body with clay and water, cleaning one’s house etc., by brooming and dusting it and in ensuring the purity of food by procuring it through rightfully earned money; while “purity of conduct” consists in lovingly and politely behaving with all, eschewing selfishness and egotism, as well as in maintaining an excellent conduct. This is external purity. Internal purity, on the other hand, consists in rooting out vices like egotism, sense of possession, passion, anger,  greed, infatuation, attachment and aversion etc., abiding in the heart, through the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Japa</span>, austerities, undertaking pilgrimages, vows and fasts etc., as well as through the performance of disinterested action and entertaining noble thoughts.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Santoṣa</span>—To remain free from all desires, balanced in mind and cheerful, viewing the consequences—whatever they may be—while discharging one’s duties as well as pleasure and pain, gain and loss and favourable and unfavourable objects or circumstances as a benign dispensation of God—this constitutes what goes by the name of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Santoṣa</span>”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Tapas</span>—To endure bodily and mental suffering when faced with it and to purify the body, mind and senses by discharging one’s sacred obligations and observing vows and fasts after subduing the mind and senses and becoming free from attachment and aversion—this constitutes what goes by the names of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Tapas</span>”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">Swādhyāya</span>—To read sacred books and the utterances of exalted souls—the study of which is conducive to the realization of God in one’s own desired form—with an eye to their meaning and inner sense—this constitutes what goes by the name of “<span class="char-style-override-10">Swādhyāya</span>”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">ºśwara-Praṇidhāna</span>—To recognize God as the supreme goal, the final resort, the supreme asylum, nay, one’s be-all and end-all after ascertaining with faith the excellences, glory, essential character and substance of God, who is Omnipotent and Omniscient and who is absolute Truth, Consciousness and Bliss solidified; to throw oneself entirely at His mercy, regarding Him as one’s Master, Supporter, Director, Protector and supreme Well-wisher, and become fearless; to obey Him considering everything as belonging<br/>to Him; to remain ever contented taking every pleasurable and painful experience coming to one as a reward sent by God; to dwell at all times without interruption on His name, attributes, glory, substance and essential character with excessive reverence and love; and to dedicate one’s all and one’s own self to Him; this constitutes what goes by the name of “ºśwara-Praṇidhāna”.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It goes without saying that God can be realized through the purification of one’s mind brought about by the practice of these two limbs of Yoga—the Yamas and the Niyamas—alone. Nay, God can be realized by duly observing even a part of these limbs with reverence, devotion and application. The great sage PataÛjali says—</p>

Therefore, grasping the true significance of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yamas</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Niyamas</span>, we should betake ourselves to their due observance with reverence, devotion and diligence in a disinterested spirit.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-13">Value of Faith and Reverence in God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्व श्रद्धा भवति भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्ध:स एव स:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XVII. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The faith of all men conforms to their mental constitution, O Arjuna. Man consists of faith; whatever the nature of his faith, he is verily that.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some people complain that they have been attending the discourses of saints for many years past and are also engaged in spiritual discipline according to their own poor lights and capacity, but are not progressing as they ought to. They are at a loss to understand the reason and desire to know what they should do in order to achieve progress in <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>. Our reply to them is that lack of faith and reverence alone hampers our progress in <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>. Therefore, pondering deeply on the question of reverence one should heighten one’s reverence. The following four are worthy of reverence—(1) God (2) Enlightened souls (3) Scriptures like the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> and (4) one’s own higher self. A man can easily attain blessedness if he develops consummate faith in and reverence for any one of these. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्पर: संयतेन्द्रिय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">     (IV. 39)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who has mastered his senses, is exclusively devoted to self-discipline and is full of reverence attains Knowledge; having had the revelation of Truth, he immediately attains supreme peace (in the form of God-realization).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this it should be concluded that earnestness is the criterion of reverence, control over the mind and senses being the criterion of earnestness. For, a man’s earnestness in the matter of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> is commensurate with his reverence and control over his mind and senses is commensurate with his earnestness.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-13-1" xml:lang="en-US">I. FAITH IN GOD</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Firm faith in and deep-rooted reverence for God consists in the belief that God exists, that He has been realized by many, is realized even at present and will continue to be realized in future as well, and that He is all-pervading, the knower of all hearts, omniscient, the inner controller of all, supremely compassionate, supremely loving, endowed with all transcendent virtues, capable of bringing the impossible into the region of possibility, omnipotent, birthless and immortal, the Supreme Person, the Supreme Reality and the Supreme Spirit. His realization eradicates all sufferings, vices, immoral conduct, evil addictions, sloth, error and ignorance of man, disengages him from the snare of mundane existence and enables him to attain supreme peace and supreme bliss, which has been referred to in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> under the names of God-realization (XIII. 34), realization of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, who is all peace (V. 24-25), attainment of immortality (XIII. 12), attainment of unending bliss (VI. 28), attainment of the imperishable supreme State (XV. 5), <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>-realization (XIII. 30), attainment of the supreme Goal (VIII. 13; XIII. 28) and so on.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a man develops devout faith in the aforesaid God as though He were manifest, whatever is done by him conforms to the Lord’s commandments and no action of his ever runs counter to His injunctions. If anyone’s actions run counter to His commandments, it should be concluded that the man has no faith even in the existence of God. For, faith and reverence do not appear in the heart of a man obsessed with doubt as to whether God exists or not, nay, if he does exist, whether He is open to realization, and if so whether He will lend Himself to his realization; again, if He comes to be realized by him, whether he will attain blessedness or not and finally whether He is rightly proclaimed as benevolent to all, omniscient, the dispenser of fruit to all, supremely loving and supremely compassionate. That is the reason why no progress is visible even though one attends the discourses of saints and remains engaged in self-discipline. Therefore we should cultivate firm faith in God combined with reverence and devotion. Not only do the śrutis, the Smr̥ti texts and the other śāstras bear testimony to the existence of God but there are strong logical grounds too to believe in it. Nay, He can even be directly perceived by means of spiritual endeavour. That of course depends on faith.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“From the aforesaid (discipline) follow the elimination of all obstacles and Self-realization too.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now let us consider the logical grounds warranting faith in the existence of God. He who is the originator (source), maker, preserver and director of ether, air, fire, water and earth, the sun and the moon, the lunar mansions and the other stars and other numerous mighty phenomena is God; for there can be no effect without any cause. The movements of the sun and moon etc., cannot be efficiently, dextrously, consciously and properly controlled without a maker and controller. Even the smallest machine would perish without someone to control it. How, then, can this mighty machine of a universe persist without a controller? And if there is none to dispense the fruit of our good and evil actions no living being would be willing to suffer punishment for its own misdeeds of its own accord even as no offender is ever seen courting punishment for his offence of his own will in the absence of a ruler or government. Action itself being inanimate, it is incapable of punishing an animate being. Nor can Nature, which is also inanimate, reward or punish anyone according to its merits without the help of an animate being. An animate being alone can reward or punish anyone according to his or her deserts consciously and fairly. God of course is the principle animating of all conscious beings, the All-seeing witness, omniscient and omnipotent. This is in consonance with logic and sacred lore.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If someone denies the existence of God, it is presumptuous on his part to do so. Let him prove what he says. It may be urged by him in reply that “If the non-existence of God cannot be proved, there is no satisfactory proof for His existence either; hence it is doubtful whether God exists or not.” Let us, however, turn this doubt to account by intelligently bestowing our thought on this doubt. Suppose there is no God and yet there are people who believe in His existence. Now if really there is no God, He is equally non-existent for those who believe in Him as well as for those who do not. Neither does the believer stand to lose nor does the unbeliever stand to gain anything under such circumstances. Both stand on an equal footing. It is not that the unbeliever would get any reward for his unbelief or be able to realize God by denying His existence or that the believer will be punished or deprived of God-realization by believing in Him. There being no God, His realization is out of the question. On the other hand, if the belief of the believer comes out to be true, the latter would take to spiritual endeavour according to the divine commandments and will be rewarded with God-realization. Nay, rid of all trouble, obligations and sorrows, he will attain supreme peace and supreme bliss. The unbeliever, however, will remain deprived of all these and will have to suffer great affliction in the shape of the tortures of hell. Hence it is beneficial in everyway to believe in the existence of God even though it may be doubtful. Nay, believing in the existence of God, intelligent and thoughtful men should take refuge in Him with reverence, faith and devotion. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā </span>the Lord says—</p>

<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-13-2" xml:lang="en-US">II. FAITH IN AND REVERENCE FOR <br/>AN ENLIGHTENED SOUL</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We must also believe and take it on trust that there have been and still exist many an enlightened soul and many more will come to be in the future as well. Those exalted souls who attain God-realization by following the discipline of action, devotion or Knowledge are believed to be men  of wisdom of a high order. The following have been declared in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> as the characteristics of those that have attained the heights of God-realization through the discipline of Action—</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रजहाति यदा कामान् सर्वान् पार्थ मनोगतान्।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">    (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> II. 55-56)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, when one thoroughly dismisses all cravings of the heart, and is satisfied in the self through (the joy of) the self, then he is called stable of mind. The sage whose mind remains unperturbed amid sorrows, whose thirst for pleasures has altogether disappeared, and who is free from passion, fear and anger, is called stable of mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The characteristics of such exalted souls continue to be discussed in verses 57 and 58 as well as in many succeeding verses of Discourse II. They are further delineated in the following verses of Discourse VI—</p>
<p class="Shlok">जितात्मन: प्रशान्तस्य परमात्मा समाहित:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The Supreme Spirit established in the knowledge of the self-controlled man whose mind is perfectly serene in the midst of pairs of opposites, such as cold and heat, joy and sorrow, honour and ignominy. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span> whose mind is sated with <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span> (Knowledge of <span class="char-style-override-10">Nirguṇa Brahma</span>) and <span class="char-style-override-10">VijÛāna</span> (Knowledge of manifest Divinity), who is unmoved under all circumstances, whose senses stand completely mastered, and to whom earth, stone and gold are all alike, is spoken of as a God-realized soul. He who looks upon well-wishers and neutrals as well as upon meditators, friends and foes, relatives and objects of hatred, the virtuous and the sinful with the same eye, stands supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The characteristics of those that have attained God-realization by treading the path of Devotion have been delineated in the following verses—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अद्वेष्टा सर्वभूतानां मैत्र: करुण एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहंकार: समदु:खसुख: क्षमी॥</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">   (XII. 13-14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who is free from malice towards all beings, friendly and compassionate, rid of the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, balanced in joy and sorrow, forgiving by nature, ever-contented and mentally united with Me, nay, who has subdued his mind, senses and body, has a firm resolve, and has surrendered his mind and reason to Me—that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The description of these characteristics is continued still further in verses 15 to 19 of Discourse XII—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even so the characteristics of those who have attained God-realization by treading the path of Knowledge have been delineated in the following verses—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिता: समदर्शिन:॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The wise look with the same eye on a <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span> endowed with learning and culture, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a pariah too.

<p class="Shlok">समदु:खसुख: स्वस्थ: समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चन:।</p>

<p class="Shlok">सर्वारम्भपरित्यागी गुणातीत: स उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XIV. 24-25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who is ever established in the Self, takes sorrow and joy alike, regards a clod of earth, a stone and a piece of gold as equal in value, is possessed of wisdom, receives the pleasant as well as the unpleasant in the same spirit, and views censure and praise alike, he who is indifferent to honour and ignominy, is alike to the cause of a friend as well as to that of an enemy, and has renounced the sense of doership in all undertakings, is said to have risen above the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The characteristics of exalted souls of this category have also been described earlier in verses 22 and 23 of Discourse XIV as well as in other chapters. We should try to emulate the conduct of enlightened souls endowed with the characteristics mentioned above and should carry out their injunctions with reverence and devotion. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (III. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For whatever a great man does, that very thing other men also do; whatever standard he sets up, the generality of men follow the same.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even an ignorant man lacking in critical acumen can be redeemed by emulating in this way the conduct of enlightened souls as our ideal or by carrying out their injunctions with reverence and devotion. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्ये त्वेवमजानन्त: श्रुत्वान्येभ्य उपासते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तेऽपि चातितरन्त्येव मृत्युं श्रुतिपरायणा:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (XIII. 25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Not knowing thus, other dull-witted persons, however, worship even as they have heard from others; and even those who are thus devoted to hearing, are able to cross the ocean of mundane existence in the shape of death.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Of course it is true that such an enlightened soul can hardly be found even among millions of men. This is borne out by the Lord, who says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मनुष्याणां सहस्त्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (VII. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Hardly one among thousands of men strives to realize Me; of those striving Yogīs, again, some rare one (devoting himself exclusively to Me) knows Me in reality.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this it follows that such exalted souls do exist although they are rarely to be found. Exalted souls have existed in the world in all ages and exist even now; but they can be discovered only through reverence and love. God too cannot be realized without reverence and love. Hence, enlightened souls endowed with the aforesaid characteristics should be reverently sought for. How are we to recognize them?—it may be asked. Our reply to this is that, the existence of an exalted soul can be found out through a process of very powerful reasoning. For our purposes an exalted soul is he whose sight, touch and thought and talk with whom bring out in us the aforesaid characteristics of exalted souls. No other means of finding out an exalted soul is open to us. If any exalted soul declares himself to be such, no one would believe him; on the other hand, such a claim would detract from the reverence one may already have for the latter. And we do not possess the capacity to find out an exalted soul by applying the aforesaid standards; for, the presence of these characteristics can be judged by one’s own selfand not by others. Exalted souls are known to themselves alone. It is their inner characteristics alone that count. Outward characteristics can be exhibited even by a pretender through dissimulation. Exalted souls look on all with an equal eye; they are unaccountably kind and full of love. Their relations with others are never guided by self-interest. All their actions are intended for the good of the world. Even then they cannot be recognized by the ordinary run of men. Anyone who can know them a little can do so only through devotion and utmost reverence attended with faith. When a man has come to recognize an exalted soul, he should seek his presence and receive instruction from him with an inquisitive mind. The Lord says to Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिन:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (IV. 34)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Understand the true nature of that knowledge by approaching illumined souls. If you prostrate at their feet, render them service, and question them with an open heart. those wise seers of Truth will instruct you in that Knowledge.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A striver who carries out with reverence and devotion the injunctions of an exalted soul worthy of reverence is spoken of as a reverent soul. More reverent than the latter is he who follows the indirect suggestions of an exalted soul. And still more reverent is he who acts up to the principles of an exalted soul and most reverent of all is he who follows the mind of an exalted soul. How can it be possible, it may be asked, to read the workings of the mind of an exalted soul ? Our reply to this is that the reverent soul who carries out the injunctions as well as the indirect suggestions of an exalted soul and also acts up to the latter’s principles comes to know his mind as well. Such a supremely reverent soul believes the words of an exalted soul even more than he does his own eyes. Suppose a house evidently built of bricks, lime and cement stands before him. Now if the exalted soul declares it to be of gold, the house will actually begin to appear to the reverent soul as built of gold. This is an illustration of supreme faith in the words of an exalted soul. To such a supremely reverent soul, the sight, speech and thought of an exalted soul, the touch of his feet and talk with him, everything is conducive to blessedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To quote noteworthy examples of supreme reverence from ancient history, Ekalavya, who was a Bhīla by birth, cherished the highest reverence for Droṇācārya, by virtue of which he outdid even Arjuna in archery (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide Mahābhārata, di.,</span> CXXXI). Satyakāma, son of Jabālā, had supreme faith in Maharṣi Gautama, son of Haridrumān, by carrying out whose command the former attained <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>-realization (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide ChāndogyaUp</span>., IV. 4—9) Upakosala cherished supreme reverence for Satyakāma and attained oneness with <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma </span>through the sacred fires by virtue of services rendered to his preceptor (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.</span>, IV. 10—14). Again, king Drupada and his consort cherished supreme faith in the words of Lord śiva, by virtue of which a daughter, named śikhaṇḍī, born to them, was transformed into a boy and become known as śikhaṇḍī (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide Mahābhārata, Udyoga.,</span> CLXXXVIII to CXCII). We should likewise cherish supreme reverence for an exalted soul and derive benefit from him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is not easy to develop reverence even for an exalted soul endowed with the aforesaid characteristics; it is through the grace of God or through the good-will of saints alone that such reverence could be developed. On the other hand a setback in one’s faith is very easy. One’s reverence for an individual naturally declines through censoriousness, hearing of his faults or through the fellowship of unbelievers and irreverent souls. Therefore one should make it a point neither to expose the faults of another nor to hear of them nor even to hold them in one’s heart. Far from conducing to one’s benefit censoriousness etc., invariably lead to harm. By prying into others’ faults, hearing of and exposing them and by dwelling on them one allows them to take root in one’s heart, thus making them liable to appear in that very individual. Nay, the man who is reviled feels aggrieved at heart; hence it is sinful to expose the faults of others. He who mentions others’ faults also receives a share of those faults. This is with reference to ordinary human beings. As regards God and enlightened souls they are intrinsically free from faults. It is still more sinful to see fault in those who are innocent. Hence a seeker of blessedness should ever be on his guard against prying into others’ faults.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Our faith in and reverence for the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> and other sacred books should lead us to believe that the teachings contained in them are based on truth are salutary. Convinced thus, and full of reverence, faith and devotion, one should try to translate into practice the kernel of the lessons taught in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and other sacred books written by the ¤<span class="char-style-override-10">Rṣis </span>of old—such as <span class="char-style-override-10">Smr̥ti</span> texts, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Itihāsa</span>, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Purāṇas </span>and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—lessons bearing on Devotion, Self-Knowledge, Dispassion, the discipline of Action, good Morals etc. For example take the case of <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span>, which is an epitome of all the śāstras. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वशास्त्रमयी गीता सर्वदेवमयो हरि:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वतीर्थमयी गङ्गा सर्ववेदमयो मनु:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Bhīṣma.</span>, XLIII. 2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> embodies the teachings of all the śāstras, śrī Hari represents all the gods in His person, the river Gaṅgā embodies all the sacred waters and the Code of Manu is the essence of all the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is the cream of all sacred books as well as of all the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वोपनिषदो गावो दोग्धा गोपालनन्दन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पार्थो वत्स: सुधीर्भोक्ता दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“All the Upaniṣads are so many cows, while śrī Kr̥ṣṇa (the Son of a cowherd) is the milkman milking them. Arjuna is the calf (for whose sake the cows were originally milked), while a man of good understanding is the enjoyer of the rich milk extracted in the form of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhagavadgītā</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Exceptionally great is the glory of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. The Lord is worshipped by means of a <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna-YajÛa </span>(an offering in the form of spiritual wisdom) by him who makes a study of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> with an eye to its meaning and underlying idea. The Lord Himself says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अध्येष्यते च य इमं धर्म्यं संवादमावयो:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानयज्ञेन तेनाहमिष्ट: स्यामिति मे मति:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XVIII. 70)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whosoever studies this sacred dialogue of ours (in the form of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>), by him (too) shall I be worshipped through offering in the form of wisdom. Such is my mind.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is even holier than the holy Gaṅgā. He who takes a dip in the waters of the Gaṅgā gets emancipated himself; whereas a man taking a plunge into the wisdom of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is rendered capable of liberating others. He who makes an intelligent study of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is greater than he who repeats it mechanically everyday. He however, is the foremost of all, who moulds his life according to the teachings of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. Therefore, with a view to assimilating the teaching of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> we should make a through study of this scripture. śrī Vedavyāsa says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या किमन्यै: शास्त्रसंग्रहै:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">या स्वयं पद्मनाभस्य मुखपद्माद् विनिःसृता<span class="char-style-override-23">:</span>॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhā. Bhīṣma.</span>, XLIII. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“What need is there for a collection of other sacred books? One should make a thorough study of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> alone with an eye to its meaning and underlying idea; for it has emanated from lotus-like lips of Lord Viṣṇu Himself (who bears a lotus sprung from His navel).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One who has made a thorough study of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> has no need for other śāstras. This does not mean anything derogatory to the other scriptures. It is only intended to show the superiority of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> over the other scriptures.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā-Māhātmya</span> too we read—</p>
<p class="Shlok">गीताशास्त्रमिदं पुण्यं य: पठेत्  प्रयत: पुमान्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विष्णो: पदमवाप्नोति भयशोकादिवर्जित:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The man who, having controlled his mind and senses, reads this sacred book of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is rid of fear, grief etc., and attains the supreme state of Viṣṇu.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> itself the Lord Himself declares it to be a scripture—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इति गुह्यतमं शास्त्रमिदमुक्तं मयानघ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतद्बुद्ध्वा बुद्धिमान्स्यात् कृतकृत्यश्च भारत॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XV. 20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O sinless Arjuna, in this way this most esoteric teaching has been imparted by Me; assimilating this man becomes wise and his mission (in life) is accomplished.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> The Lord extols in even more glowing terms the man who popularizes the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> in the world—</p>
<p class="Shlok">य इमं परमं गुह्यं मद्भक्तेष्वभिधास्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्तिं मयि परां कृत्वा मामेवैष्यत्यसंशय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XVIII. 68)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who, offering the highest love to Me, shall impart this most secret teaching of Mine to My devotees, shall attain Me; there is no doubt about it.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">न च तस्मान्मनुष्येषु कश्चिन्मे प्रियकृत्तम:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भविता न च मे तस्मादन्य: प्रियतरो भुवि॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XVIII. 69)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Among men there is none who does me a more loving service than he; nor shall anyone be dearer to Me than he on this earth.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is replete with lessons on <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhaktiyoga, Karmayoga, JÛānayoga</span> and good morals. Hence there is no room for doubt regarding the redemption of the man who, having heard discourses on, and studied and pondered the meaning of, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> with faith, reverence and devotion, moulds his conduct according to it. Even the pious acts, on the other hand, of the man who having transgressed the bounds of morality set up by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>, follows his own will, yield no good result—</p>
<p class="Shlok">य: शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारत:।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“He, who, having cast aside the injunctions of the scriptures, acts according to his own sweet will, neither attains perfection nor the highest goal, nor even happiness.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some are endowed with natural faith, unmindful of the scriptural ordinance of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>. On the subject of faith Arjuna asks a question in the opening verse of Discourse XVII as follows—“Is the action of the man who undertakes a sacrificial performance or worship etc., unmindful of the rules laid down for its conduct by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras Sāttvika, Rājasika</span> or <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span>? This question leads to the following further questions—(1) What type of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karma</span> is that which does not follow the rules of conduct laid down by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> and which is devoid of reverence? (2) What is the class of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmas</span> which follow the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> and are also inspired by reverence? (3) What is the category of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmas </span>that conform to the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> but are devoid of reverence? (4) What is the type of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmas</span> that are inspired by reverence but do not follow the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>? In reply to these questions the Lord says that actions which neither follow the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras </span>nor are inspired by reverence are <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span> in character (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide Gītā</span> XVII, 13); actions which are both inspired by reverence and conform to the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> can as well be <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika </span>as <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span>. Actions which, while following the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>, are not only inspired by reverence but are done in a disinterested spirit too are <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> in character (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide Gītā</span> XVII. 11). Actions which follow the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> but are devoid of reverence are of no value (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide Gītā</span> XVII. 28). Actions which are inspired by reverence but do not follow the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> can partake of the character of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva, Rajas</span> or <span class="char-style-override-10">Tamas</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">vide Gītā</span> XVII. 2).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence we should earnestly perform our duties in a disinterested spirit with reverence, faith and devotion according to the injunctions of the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> such as the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-13-4" xml:lang="en-US">IV. FAITH IN AND REVERENCE FOR ONE’S OWN SELF</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">First of all one should take it for granted that whatever act a man does—whether good, bad or mixed, he is sure to reap its fruit in this life as well as thereafter. Of course an act which is done in a disinterested spirit does not yield any fruit either here or hereafter. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनिष्टमिष्टं मिश्रं च त्रिविधं कर्मण: फलम्।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">From this it is proved that there is life even after death. He who realizes this cannot perpetrate a sinful act; for he knows that the fruit of good and evil acts committed in this life must be reaped—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अवश्यमेव भोक्तव्यं कृतं कर्म शुभाशुभम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नाभुक्तं क्षीयते कर्म जन्मकोटिशतैरपि॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One needs must reap the fruit of one’s good and evil deeds. An action can never be neutralized even in millions of years unless its fruit has been reaped.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To believe and put faith in the sure existence of the soul even after death—this is what is meant by faith and belief in the Self. The soul surely exists after death. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चैव न भविष्याम: सर्वे वयमत: परम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> II. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In fact, there was never a time when I did not exist, or when you or these kings did not exist. Nor is it a fact that hereafter we shall all cease to be.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">देहिनोऽस्मिन् यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.</span> II. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Just as boyhood, youth and old age are attributed to the soul through this body, even so it attains another body, The wise man does not get deluded about this.”</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.</span> II. 20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The soul is never born nor dies; nor does it become only after being born. For it is unborn, eternal, everlasting and ancient; even though the body is slain, the soul is not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> too we read—</p>
<p class="Shlok">असुर्या नाम ते लोका अन्धेन तमसाऽऽवृता:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ताॸस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जना:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Men who kill their soul (by sacrificing their spiritual interests) repeatedly attain after death demoniac wombs as well as the frightful realms of the demons, which are enveloped in utter darkness in the form of suffering and sorrow.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Reason too points to life after death. A human babe begins to cry as soon as it is born; for it is evident that it undergoes great suffering at the time of birth. Sometimes it even laughs, which leads us to conclude that it experiences joy too. The child does so only because it has cried whenever it underwent suffering and has laughed whenever it experienced joy in his past life. It was never taught to cry or laugh in its present life nor in its mother’s womb. This action is traceable to its habit of crying and laughing formed in its previous lives. This too proves the existence of a past life, and with that the existence of a future life too in the shape of his present birth is proved. When a mother gives suck to her babe, the milk of her breasts does not reach its stomach by her merely putting the nipple in its mouth. This requires the effort of the suckling to suck the milk. The babe is accustomed to this act of sucking from its previous birth. The babe also goes to sleep and at times even shudders from fear of death; for it has suffered the pangs of death in many a past life. All this he had no occasion to learn in its present life. Hence all these habitual actions prove the existence of a past life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this world some are born as birds or beasts and others as human beings; some lead a happy life, while others drag a miserable existence; some are rich and others destitute; some are healthy and others sick. If a child has acquired any of these states from his very birth, it cannot be attributed to any action on the part of the child, which has done nothing to deserve it in its present life. Therefore, the conclusion is forced upon us that this diversity is attributable to actions done in one’s previous lives; for it cannot be accounted for in any other way. All these arguments go to prove the existence of past and future lives.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence a seeker of one’s own spiritual wellbeing must reverently follow the path of devotion, spiritual knowledge and dispassion, cultivate noble virtues and practise good conduct in a disinterested spirit, giving up vices, immorality and evil addictions. By doing so one can attain blessedness in this very life. If something is found lacking and he dies beforehand, he is sure to attain his goal in the next birth.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्र तं बुद्धिसंयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यतते च ततो भूय: संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (VI. 43)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, there he (automatically) regains in that birth the spiritual insight of his previous births (i.e., the latencies of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> of even-mindedness are roused in him), and through that he strives, with greater vigour than before, for perfection (in the form of God-realization).”</p>
<p class="Shlok">पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवशोऽपि स:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जिज्ञासुरपि योगस्य शब्दब्रह्मातिवर्तते॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VI. 44)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The other one (who takes birth in a rich family), though subject to the sense-objects feels drawn towards God by force of the habit acquired in his previous birth; nay, even the seeker of enlightenment on <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> in the form of even-mindedness also transcends the fruit of actions performed with some interested motive as laid down in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even if it is urged by the objector that he does not believe in the authority of the scriptures nor in reason and that the existence of life after death is still open to question, it is wiser and more profitable to believe in such life even in the face of grave doubts; for even as it has been proved in the foregoing paragraphs on logical grounds that a believer in the existence of God positively stands to gain and that the unbeliever remains a loser, so does a believer in life after death too stands to gain and the unbeliever remains a loser.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Supposing one does not believe in the existence of God, exalted souls and the śāstras and even in reason, he should at least believe in the existence of his own soul. That a man should practise what he thinks good in his heart and should totally abstain from that which he considers undesirable, is also tantamount to believing in the existence of one’s soul. It is a matter of direct experience that a man who does wrong to you or ill-treats you rankles in your heart, nay, such a man falls in your estimation. From this we should take a lesson that one should never misbehave towards anyone. We directly perceive that another man who behaves well with us, renders service to us, gratifies us and acts in conformity with our mind or wishes well of us is looked upon by us as an exceedingly noble soul. This should teach a lesson to us that we too should likewise behave well towards others. If any other duty apart from this comes before us, we should ponder about it in our mind and completely abandon that which our conscience pronounces as undesirable and diligently pursue that which our inner self approves of.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For example, suppose you have to make a choice between continence, on the one hand, and adultery, on the other. If you refer to your own self in the matter you will get the answer that practice of continence is highly commendable, while adultery is an abominable act. Hence one should practise continence and should never take to adultery. Similarly suppose there is a conflict between gratifying others, doing a good turn to others, rendering service to others and doing a friendly act to another, on the one hand, and doing an unfavourable act to others, inflicting suffering on others and harming another, on the other. On referring to our inner self we shall get the reply that the act of gratifying others, doing a good turn to others, rendering service to others and doing a friendly act to another is highly commendable, while doing an ill turn to another, inflicting suffering on others and harming another, on the other hand, is most undesirable. Therefore one should do a good turn to others, render service to others, do a friendly act to another and gratify others and should never do an unfavourable act to another nor inflict suffering on others, much less harm others. Similarly if there is a choice between speaking truthful, agreeable and wholesome words, on the one hand, and uttering untruthful, harsh and harmful words, on the other, we shall on referring to our inner self get the reply that speaking truthful, agreeable and wholesome words alone is desirable and uttering untruthful, harsh and harmful words is highly deprecable. Hence, we should always take care to speak truthful, agreeable and wholesome words alone and should never utter untruthful, unpalatable and harmful words. Similarly in every other matter, one should ponder with an untainted and unbiased mind and should resolutely and diligently pursue that which is judged to be morally right and should altogether renounce that which is pronounced as undesirable. Even he who puts faith in his own self and after careful investigation as indicated above conducts himself in the world in a selfless, unattached and unegotistic way attains blessedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One can attain blessedness by putting faith in any of the above-mentioned four, viz., God, exalted souls, scriptures like the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> and one’s own self; much more can one attain blessedness by putting faith in all the four. Faith and reverence grow as a result of our estimating the worth of a thing and they dwindle if we entertain a low opinion about it. Hence a seeker of blessedness should value everything and should never despise anything. Says Nārāyaṇa Swāmī—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तज पर अवगुन नीर कौं छीर गुननि सौं प्रीति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">हंस संत की सर्वदा ‘नारायन’ यह रीति॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">‘Ignoring others’ faults like water contained in milk, they love to pick up good points like milk. Such is the way of good men, who resemble swans in this respect, says Nārāyaṇa.”<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-14">God-realization through Disinterested Action</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> (the Discipline of Action), <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhaktiyoga</span> (the Discipline of Devotion) and <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span> (the Discipline of Knowledge)—all these disciplines have been recognized as superior in their own place, easy to practise and quickly leading to blessedness. Occasion is taken here to write something about <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span>. <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga </span>is easy to practise. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञेय: स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span>, who neither hates nor desires, should be ever considered a <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsī</span> (renouncer).

<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, although the heights of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga </span>are difficult to ascend without the ladder of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span>, the practice of the latter quickly leads to God-realization. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Without <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span>, however, <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayoga </span>(or renunciation of doership in relation to all activities of the mind, the senses and the body) is difficult to attain; whereas the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> who keeps his mind fixed on God, reaches <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> in no time, Arjuna.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> all the three disciplines—<span class="char-style-override-10">Bhaktiyoga, JÛānayoga </span>and<span class="char-style-override-10"> Karmayoga</span>—have been declared by the Lord as independent of one another—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानेनात्मनि पश्यन्ति केचिदात्मानमात्मना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्ये सांख्येन योगेन कर्मयोगेन चापरे॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Some by meditation behold the Self (<span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span>) in their own heart with the help of their pure reason; others by proceeding along the path of Knowledge; and others, again, by treading the path of Action.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत्सांख्यै: प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">  (V. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The supreme state which is reached by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span> is attained also by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span>. Therefore, he who sees <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> as one (so far as their result goes) really sees.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> has been pronounced as superior even to the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhaktiyoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रेयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाद्‍ध्यानं विशिष्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (XII. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Knowledge is better than practice (carried on without proper insight), meditation is superior to knowledge, and renunciation of the fruit of actions is even superior to meditation; for peace immediately follows from renunciation.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">संन्यास: कर्मयोगश्च नि:श्रेयसकरावुभौ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्  कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (V. 2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The Yoga of Knowledge and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> of Action both lead to supreme bliss. Of the two, however, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> of Action (being easier to practise) is superior to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> of Knowledge.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From this it follows that Disinterested Action is superior even to meditation on the Supreme Spirit. A comparison is made here between meditation on God divorced from renunciation of its fruit, on the one hand, and disinterested Action in the form of renunciation of the fruit of one’s action, devoid of meditation on God, on the other. There is renunciation of fruit in Disinterested Action; that is why it leads to supreme peace in the form of God-realization. Meditation on God in which there is no such renunciation of fruit can only accomplish the object for which the meditation is being done; it cannot lead to supreme peace. In praise of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनाश्रित: कर्मफलं कार्यं कर्म करोति य:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स संन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (VI. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who does his duty without expecting the reward of actions is a <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsī</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span>) and a <span class="char-style-override-24">y</span><span class="char-style-override-10">ogī</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span>) both. He is no <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsī </span>(renouncer) who has merely renounced the sacred fire; even so, he is no Yogī, who has merely given up all activity.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Therefore Disinterested Action consists only in renouncing the fruit of and attachment to one’s actions<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span> enjoined by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> with due regard to one’s grade in society and stage in life.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* For a detailed exposition of <span class="char-style-override-10">Varṇāśrama-Dharma</span> a reference is invited to the writer’s article under the caption “Humanity and <span class="char-style-override-10">Varṇāśrama-Dharma</span>” published in the form of a serial in the foregoing four ordinary numbers of the “Kalyana-Kalpataru” consecutively.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A man should discharge the duties peculiar to his grade in society as well as all other duties enjoined by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> with regard to his stage in life, the duties shared by him in common with others and those binding on him in times of distress, renouncing the fruit as well as attachment to them. This is how one is able to pursue the discipline of Disinterested Action. The essence of Disinterested Action has been given in a nutshell in the following verse of <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhagavadgīta</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (II. 47)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Your right is to work only, but never to its fruit. Be not instrumental in your actions bear fruit, nor let your attachment be to inaction.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Pointing out a man’s right and freedom to act by the words <span class="char-style-override-14">‘कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते’</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span>forming the first quarter of the above-quoted verse emphasis has been laid on the performance of duty—on the obligatory nature of duty. The words <span class="char-style-override-14">‘मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि’</span> representing the fourth quarter also seek to lay emphasis on action alone by forbidding renunciation of action. The words <span class="char-style-override-14">‘मा फलेषु कदाचन’</span> representing the second quarter are intended to show that man has no power over the fruit of actions, rather he is helpless in the matter; while by asking Arjuna not to allow his actions to be motivated by their reward in the words <span class="char-style-override-14">‘मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भू:’</span> forming the third quarter of the above-quoted verse, the Lord enjoins him to give up the craving for pleasures of sense, attachment, the sense of possession and pride. The same idea has been elucidated in the following verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विहाय कामान् य: सर्वान् पुमांश्चरति नि:स्पृह:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहंकार: स शान्तिमधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (II. 71)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who gives up all desires, and moves free from attachment, egotism and the thirst for enjoyment attains peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the above verse the Lord speaks of renouncing desire, the thirst for enjoyment, the sense of possession and egotism. Attachment and craving should be understood as covered by <span class="char-style-override-10">Spr̥hā </span>(the thirst for enjoyment) and pride should be taken as included in egotism.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Side by side with the renunciation of attachment the Lord also speaks of remaining balanced in success and failure—</p>
<p class="Shlok">योगस्थ: कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनंजय।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सिद्‍ध्यसिद्‍ध्यो: समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (II. 48)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, perform your duties dwelling in <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span>, relinquishing attachment and remaining indifferent to success and failure—even-mindedness is called Yoga.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> As a sequel to remaining balanced in success and failure, pairs of opposites like attachment and aversion, joy and grief etc., automatically disappear. Attachment and aversion alone are the root of all evils. Therefore the shaking off of attachment and aversion implies the shaking off of all evil propensities. Just as giving up egotism and the sense of mine implies the shedding of all evil propensities, similarly even when even-mindedness is acquired all evil propensities disappear. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> emphasizes at some places the renunciation of attachment to actions as well as to the pleasures of sense (VI. 4); there relinquishment of the fruit of actions is covered by the renunciation of attachment to the objects of senses. At other places the Lord talks of renunciation of attachment alone (II. 48); in that context renunciation of the desire for fruit should be taken as covered by the renunciation of attachment, since from attachment alone springs up the desire for the objects of senses—<span class="char-style-override-14">सङ्गात् संजायते काम:</span><span class="char-style-override-15"> </span>(II. 62). Hence the renunciation of an effect is naturally implied by the renunciation of its cause. Just as the felling down of a tree is implied in the act of cutting its roots, so the renunciation of desire, thirst for enjoyment, craving etc., is naturally implied in the renunciation of attachment; for attachment alone is the root of all these. Hence God-realization can be attained by performing one’s duties giving up attachment to them. The Lord says to Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्मादसक्त: सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर।</p>
<p class="Shlok">असक्तो ह्याचरन् कर्म परमाप्नोति पुरुष:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (III. 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, always efficiently do your duty without attachment. Doing work without attachment, man attains the Supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly renunciation of the fruit of one’s actions too should be taken to cover the renunciation of attachment, the thirst for enjoyment, craving and the sense of possession. Generally people take to action for the sake of reward only. Hence the glory of giving up the reward of one’s duties has been particularly stressed in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> (VI. 1).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Really speaking, actions which are performed regardless of their fruit and without attachment are no actions at all—</p>
<p class="Shlok">त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किंचित्  करोति स:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (IV. 20)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He, who, having totally given up attachment to actions and their fruit, has got over the dependence on the world, and is ever satisfied, does nothing at all, though he may remain ever engaged in action.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For such actions are a mere semblance of actions and not actions in the real acceptance of the term. This is what is meant by seeing inaction in action. It is the glory of such actions alone that has been referred to in IV. 18 as the glory of seeing inaction in action. This alone constitutes the secret of actions and here lies the skill in action;—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योग: कर्मसु कौशलम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   ( II. 50)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Endowed with even-mindedness one sheds in this life both good and evil. Therefore, exert yourself for this <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> of even-mindedness. Skill in action lies in (the practice of this) <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The idea is that <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> consists in even-mindedness and this even-mindedness alone constitutes the skill in action. This even-mindedness alone enables a man to attain blessedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Here it may be urged that according to the scriptures emancipation is out of the question without Knowledge. Admitted that it is so; but that supreme knowledge of the reality of God, which has been glorified by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> and other sacred books, dawns as a matter of course upon the consciousness of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> on his mind getting purified through the practice of Disinterested Action.</p>
<p class="Shlok">न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्  स्वयं योगसंसिद्ध: कालेनात्मनि विन्दति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (IV. 38)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In this world, there is no purifying agency like Knowledge; he who has attained purity of heart through practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> automatically realizes it in the self in course of time.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The use of the word <span class="char-style-override-10">‘Swayam’</span> in the abovequoted verse clearly proves that the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> need not fall back upon any other discipline or individual, that he is directly able to attain the aforesaid knowledge.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, all his sins being washed away as a sequel to such Disinterested Action, his mind too gets automatically purified—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यज्ञायाचरत: कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (Second half of IV. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“....... All actions of that liberated man who works for the sake of sacrifice melt away.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is why—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कायेन मनसा बुद्‍ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">On the mind being purified he is able by virtue of such Disinterested Action to attain that supreme peace, characterized by being firmly established in God, which follows from God-realization—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Offering the fruit of actions to God, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogi</span> attains peace in the shape of God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way we have shown above how <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> leads to speedy realization of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma </span>(V.6), to God-realization (III. 19), to the dawn of spiritual enlightenment (IV. 38), to the dissolution of merit and sin (IV. 23), to the purification of the mind (V.11) and to the attainment of peace (II. 71; V. 12), as also how <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga </span>is easy to practise (V. 3) and how it excels all other disciplines (V. 2; VI. 1; XII. 12). Besides this the performance of sacrifices, the practice of austerities and the undertaking of other noble pursuits enjoined by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> have been declared by the Lord as conducive to the purification of men of discrimination.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be relinquished, they must be performed at all events. For sacrifice, gift and austerities performed by wise men purify the heart.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, the Lord has pronounced it to be his settled opinion that sacrificial performances, charity, austerities and other pursuits enjoined by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> must be undertaken giving up attachment and their fruit—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एतान्यपि तु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलानि च।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">  (XVIII. 6)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, Arjuna, My considered and best opinion is that these acts of sacrifice, gift and penance, and all other duties must be performed relinquishing attachment and fruit.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While engaging in action a man invariably thinks of the return which it is expected to yield. In this way a man’s actions are invariably actuated by self-interest. This is what they call an interested motive. Giving up such interested motives a man should, on the other hand, think what good his action will bring to the entire living creation; for altruism constitutes the highest virtue, while maleficence to others is a sin.<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* Says Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa—</p>

<p class="Footnotes-Right-English" xml:lang="en-GB">(Rāmacaritamānasa VII. l. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Hence for him whose heart is set on the good of others nothing is difficult to achieve in this world—</p>
<p class="Shlok">परहित बस जिन्ह के मन माहीं।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तिन्ह कहुँ जग दुर्लभ कछु नाहीं॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmacaritamānasa</span> III. XXX. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Pointing out the characteristics of exalted souls, Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says the same thing in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> too—</p>
<p class="Shlok">लभन्ते ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृषय: क्षीणकल्मषा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">छिन्नद्वैधा यतात्मान: सर्वभूतहिते रता:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (V. 25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The seers whose sins have been washed away, whose doubts have been dispelled by Knowledge, whose mind is firmly established in God and who are actively engaged in promoting the welfare of all beings, attain <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, who is all Peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore with the movements of our mind, speech and body we should perform such deeds alone as are conducive to the good of others, and should refrain from such actions as are not conducive to the good of others. Nay, we should never do a thing which is injurious to others. On the other hand, we should devote our life to pursuits which are conducive to the supreme good of others—constitute the highest service to them. To cater for the mundane pleasure or sensual gratification of others is service, whereas to do a thing which rebounds to the spiritual benefit of another constitutes the highest form of service to the latter. If, however, a man renders any kind of service whatsoever to another in a disinterested spirit, such service is the highest service done by him. To render the highest service to all and sundry in a disinterested spirit while remaining devoted to the supreme good of all should be the paramount duty and supreme goal of a seeker of blessedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore giving up the sense of possession, attachment, pride and self-interest with respect to all worldly objects and enjoyments, to his body and all his actions, a man should do well to strive till his last breath to perform whole-heartedly with his mind, body, money and men his duties enjoined by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> in the shape of sacrificial performances, charity, austerities, visiting sacred places, observing sacred vows and fasts, practising the five forms of abstinence (<span class="char-style-override-10">Yamas</span>) and the five religious observances (<span class="char-style-override-10">Niyamas</span>), service to his parents, behaving well with others and doing a good turn to the afflicted and forlorn, nay, to the entire living creation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God-realization is attained even through disinterested action alone and much more so if <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti</span> (Devotion) is added it. The Lord says in <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रेयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाद् ध्यानं विशिष्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानात् कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (XII. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Knowledge is better than practice (carried without proper discernment), meditation on God is superior to knowledge, and renunciation of the fruit of actions is superior even to meditation; for peace immediately follows from renunciation.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The idea is that knowledge is superior to repeated practice without discernment, repeated study of sacred books or any other spiritual practice repeatedly pursued. But that scriptural knowledge alone which is not accompanied by such practice is superior as compared to that practice which does not follow from scriptural knowledge. Meditation on God is superior to scriptural knowledge devoid of such meditation, and not to direct or immediate knowledge. And renunciation of the fruit of actions is superior to meditation which is not disinterested. In other words, disinterested action or action which is free from longing for its reward is superior to meditation on God practised from some interested motive; for the act of self-abnegation involved in renouncing the reward of actions leads immediately to lasting peace. He attains that very peace which follows from God-realization. Hence disinterested action is superior to all; that is why renunciation of the fruit of actions has been declared as superior even to meditation. The renunciation of the fruit of actions referred to in the aforesaid verse, is not accompanied by meditation; for meditation on God stands comprised in Devotion to God, which is unquestionably superior to everything else. But disinterested action, even when it is not accompanied by meditation, is superior to meditation, which is not characterized by renunciation of the fruit of actions but is carried on from some interested motive. This constitutes the discipline of Disinterested Action unmixed with Devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Verse 19 of Discourse III of <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span> too speaks of Disinterested Action unmixed with Devotion. God-realization has been declared in that verse as following from renunciation of attachment. The Lord says to <br/>Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्मादसक्त: सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर।</p>
<p class="Shlok">असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुष:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (III. 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, always efficiently do your duty without attachment. Doing work without attachment, man attains the Supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Disinterested action as inculcated in the foregoing verse is not accompanied by Devotion and the striver is enjoined in this verse to do his obligatory duties incessantly. The verse therefore implies that the striver should incessantly do his duty in a detached spirit at all times. The absence of attachment rules out desire as a matter of course; for—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सङ्गात्संजायते काम:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> II. 62)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“From attachment proceeds desire.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Where attachment, the cause, is absent, desire, which is the effect, is out of the question.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly the opening verse of Discourse VI as well speaks of Disinterested Action unmixed with Devotion. Says the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनाश्रित: कर्मफलं कार्यं कर्म करोति य:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स संन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रिय:॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (VI. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who does his duty without expecting the fruit of actions is a Saṁnyāsī (<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span>) and a <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī (Karmayogī)</span> both. He is no <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsī </span>(renouncer) who has merely renounced the sacred fire; even so, he is no <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span>, who has merely given up all activity.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A man who is really actuated by lofty motives, who cherishes the spirit of renunciation in his heart, nay, whose heart is illumined by the light of wisdom, who inwardly practises Yoga and meditation on the Supreme Spirit has not been declared unfit for the title of a Saṁnyāsī (recluse) or Yogī.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even so at some places the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> speaks of people renouncing attachment and at others of those eschewing desire. There is no mention of Devotion accompanying such renunciation. Even such <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> (which is not accompanied by Devotion) is conducive to Liberation. There is a reference to this type of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> even in verses 11 and 12 of Discourse V of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कायेन मनसा बुद्‍ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">योगिन: कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वात्मशुद्धये॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(V. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogīs</span> perform action only with their senses, mind, intellect, and body as well, withdrawing the feeling of meum in respect of them and shaking off attachment, simply for the sake of self purification. Their mind getting purified thereby, they attain God-realization.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord clearly mentions this in the following verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">युक्त: कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्नोति नैष्ठिकीम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अयुक्त: कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (V. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Offering the fruit of actions to God, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> attains peace that follows from God-realization; whereas he who works with a selfish motive, being attached to the fruit of actions through desire, gets tied down.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way the type of Disinterested Action which has been referred to in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> as having no connection whatsoever with Devotion is Disinterested Action purely as such (having nothing to do with Devotion). In other words, action which is free from desire and attachment and is performed as a matter of duty is Disinterested Action purely as such. Even such action makes for redemption of the soul and more so when it is accompanied by Devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now let us consider what that action is. That work or duty which has been assigned by the <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span> to a man or woman belonging to a particular grade of society or stage in life, if performed in a disinterested spirit, leads to his or her salvation. The duty of a married woman, for example, is to follow the code of conduct prescribed for a devoted wife. She can realize God merely by following such conduct in a disinterested spirit. Similarly a man whose parents are living can attain the highest goal merely by serving them in a disinterested spirit. Service to his parents is the highest duty of such a man; all other duties are secondary to him. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Manusmr̥ti</span> we read—</p>
<p class="Shlok">त्रिष्वेतेष्विति कृत्यं हि पुरुषस्य समाप्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एष धर्म: पर: साक्षादुपधर्मोऽन्य उच्यते॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (II. 237)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The entire duty of a man is fully accomplished when these three (<span class="char-style-override-10">viz.</span>, the parents and the preceptor) are propitiated through service. For such service is the paramount duty of a man, directly devolving on him; every other duty is declared to be subordinate.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A reference to our sacred books will show what a large number of women have been redeemed by following the conduct prescribed for a devoted wife. While reproducing the advice tendered by Anasūyā (the consort of sage Atri) to Sītā in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Araṇya-Kāṇḍa</span> of <span class="char-style-override-10">śrī Rāmacaritamānasa</span>, Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa too says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकइ धर्म एक ब्रत नेमा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कायँ बचन मन पति पद प्रेमा॥</p>
<p class="Uwach">***</p>
<p class="Shlok">बिनु श्रम नारि परम गति लहई।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पतिब्रत धर्म छाड़ि छल गहई॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (III. iv. 5, 9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Devotion through body, speech and mind to her lord’s feet is the only duty, sacred vow and penance for a woman ........ The woman who sincerely takes a vow of fidelity to her husband easily attains the highest state.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Devotion to one’s husband has likewise been glorified at numerous places in our sacred books. Anasūyā herself followed the course of conduct prescribed for a devoted wife so faithfully that Brahmā, Viṣṇu and śiva (the Creator, Protector and Destroyer respectively of the universe) took descent from her in their partial being. There are many other such examples of wifely devotion forthcoming in our sacred books.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly a man can attain the highest state by serving all; of course he must be actuated by a disinterested spirit. He must not have even a trace of selfishness of any kind whatsoever lurking anywhere in his mind. Our duty in everyway is to serve all. He too who undertakes sacrificial performances and other noble pursuits and practices charity and austerities in a disinterested spirit is sure to attain blessedness.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is the duty of a <span class="char-style-override-10">śūdra</span> (a member of the labouring class) to serve all. He attains the highest state by serving the members of all the other three classes (<span class="char-style-override-10">viz</span>., the priestly class, the warrior class and the mercantile class). But he too must be actuated by a disinterested spirit. <span class="char-style-override-10">A Vaiśya</span> (a member of the mercantile class) can similarly be redeemed by carrying on the pursuit of agriculture, rearing cows, and trade in a disinterested spirit; but not so the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> who is a seeker of wealth and undertakes any of these pursuits for the sake of hoarding money. That <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> alone is actuated by a disinterested spirit, who has no interest of his own and is actuated by the motive of gratifying all by undertaking the pursuits of agriculture, trade or rearing the bovine race, and who seeks no return whatsoever even after gratifying all in the aforesaid manner. If while serving others you seek honour, praise or prestige, your service is not disinterested. If you feel flattered to find others bestowing honour on or showing respect to you or singing your praises, although you do not seek honour, praise and respect nor do you aim at receiving these, even then you are actuated by a selfish motive. Such gratification in a way detracts from your disinterested spirit. A man should altogether banish from his mind the idea that others should compliment him by calling him a man of highly disinterested spirit and utterly selfless. Such compliments should not sound pleasing to his ears; on the other hand he should feel abashed and pained at heart to hear them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the course of every undertaking a man should reflect and see for himself whether he has any craving or attachment behind that pursuit. Where there is attachment or craving at the back of some undertaking it should be taken for granted that the pursuit is not actuated by a disinterested spirit. In any case it is supremely good to serve others, even if such service is not disinterested. Even if a man renders good offices to others, and practises charity and beneficence in anyway and does so, say, out of fear or shame or with a craving for honour and praise, his doing so is far better than not doing all this. Of course an action which is disinterested is indeed most exalted.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A man should always remain wide awake. A craving of any kind whatsoever detracts from one’s disinterested spirit. There is a world of difference between an action done from an interested motive and a disinterested action. They are poles asunder. Bearing this in mind a man should act in a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Before a man undertakes to do a thing the thought strikes his mind as to what he will gain thereby. This is what we call an interested motive. Therefore a man should keep in view the benefit that is likely to accrue to the world at large from an action of his. The good of the greatest number should be his ideal and he should seek no return whatsoever for this benefit; he should rather not accept a return even if it is offered to him. It should, however, be borne in mind that in some cases even the acceptance of a return turns out to be a disinterested act. If, for example, a man bestows a gift in a disinterested spirit as a matter of duty on a hermit, saint, <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span> or any other householder as something due to him, to accept such a gift in a disinterested spirit does good to the donor and the donee both. To take another example, suppose a hermit is in need of a piece of cloth to cover his body with and a donor pressingly offers a piece to him and suppose the hermit has no craving for it for all practical purposes but feels inclined to pull on with his worn out and tattered cloth; yet if, when pressed by the donor, he accepts his offer for the donor’s gratification and pleasure, no blame attaches to him. If the donor is likely to feel pained by the thought that the hermit has declined his offer, because the donor is good for nothing, to accept his offer just to spare him that pain is as good as declining it. To take a third example, suppose a man sends to a householder friend of his some fruits and other articles saying that they were received as a present in connection with the wedding of his own son, which he would fain share with his friend, and if the man sending those fruits etc., is likely to feel pained at their non-acceptance by his friend, their acceptance would be as good as declining the offer. To take a fourth example, suppose we call on a friend of ours and the latter proceeds to show hospitality to us and if he is likely to be pained by our not accepting it, our acceptance of his hospitality would be as unobjectionable as to decline it.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To accept for one’s own gain a service done by another is surely an act prompted by self-interest; whereas it is free from blemish to accept it for the latter’s pleasure. In the course of every undertaking we should always be on our guard to see that we have no selfish motive behind it. A selfish motive is the only noxious factor. Suppose we take work from a son, wife or servant and if they feel pained by our declining to take such service from them, to take work or service from them is as unobjectionable as not to accept it. Before accepting any gift or service from another we should consider whether we accept that gift or service for his or her gratification or for our own gratification. We are actuated by an interested motive only where there is some self-interest behind our work. Such an interested motive is a blot on one’s disinterested spirit. But there is nothing wrong in our accepting that which is really our legitimate due. The best thing is that we accept something not for our own pleasure but for the gratification of others. This constitutes our disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Moreover, it should be particularly borne in mind that we conceive a liking for whatever comes to us reacting agreeably on our mind, while we loathe that which reacts unfavourably on our mind. But where there are attraction and aversion at play, no disinterested spirit is there. Therefore likes and dislikes should be altogether eschewed while undertaking any and every pursuit. It does good to one’s soul even to move among the pleasures of sense provided one is free from likes and dislikes. To enjoy the pleasures of sense in a legitimate way without conceiving a liking or zest for them is what is meant by moving among them. Taking food and drink, for example, is a legitimate act inasmuch as it is necessary and desirable for keeping the body and soul together. The expression “moving among the objects of sense” smacks of attachment; hence we feel compelled to add a note of warning that the phrase “moving among the objects of senses” should not be taken in the sense of enjoying the pleasures of sense with a feeling of attachment or zest. An act of moving among the pleasures of sense such as taking food and drink in a legitimate way for the sake of bare maintenance of body without any craving whatsoever is an example of what they call a disinterested spirit. We read in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रसादे सर्वदु:खानां हानिरस्योपजायते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धि: पर्यवतिष्ठते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (II. 64-65)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“But the self-controlled striver, while utilizing the various sense-objects through his senses, which are disciplined and free from likes and dislikes, attains placidity of mind. With the attainment of such placidity of mind, all his sorrows come to an end; and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind, soon withdrawing itself from all sides, becomes firmly established in God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such is the glory of a disinterested spirit. There is no attachment, no desire, no likes and dislikes in the act of moving among the objects of senses referred to in the above-quoted verses. The striver mentioned here performs legitimate acts only as a matter of duty. He moves among the objects of senses by his senses alone without attachment or aversion. Such conduct on his part ensures his salvation. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विहाय कामान्य: सर्वान्पुमांश्चरति नि:स्पृह:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहंकार: स शान्तिमधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (II. 71)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who gives up all desires, and moves free from attachment, egotism and thirst for enjoyment attains peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the verse preceding this as well we read—</p>
<p class="Shlok">स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He in whom all enjoyments merge themselves attains peace; not he who hankers after such enjoyments.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence the verse quoted above also refers to the attainment of the same real peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">In this way the salvation of a man is ensured even through mere disinterested action, much more so when Devotion is added to it.<span></span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly he who is devoid of good conduct speedily becomes virtuous and attains supreme peace. The Lord says to Arjuna—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते मामनन्यभाक्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">साधुरेव स मन्तव्य: सम्यग्व्यवसितो हि स:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> IX., 30)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Even if the vilest sinner worships Me with exclusive devotion, he should be accounted a saint; for he has rightly resolved (He is positive in this belief that there is nothing like devoted worship of God).”</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्षिप्रं भवति धर्मात्मा शश्वच्छान्तिं निगच्छति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कौन्तेय प्रति जानीहि न मे भक्त: प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (IX. 31)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Speedily he becomesvirtuous and secures lasting peace. Know it for certain, Arjuna, that My devotee never falls.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is all the more easy for those who belong to the higher grades of society and are of noble conduct to get so redeemed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore one should seek the protection in everyway of the Lord alone, who is unaccountably loving and supremely compassionate. What is meant by seeking the protection in everyway of the Lord is found mentioned in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (IX. 34)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, adore Me and salute Me; thus linking yourself with Me and entirely depending on Me, you shall come to Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the foregoing verse the Lord prescribes four modes of seeking the protection of the Lord. The import of these should be understood. The following are the four principal instruments in our possession—the mind, reason, the senses and the body. By saying <span class="char-style-override-15">‘मन्मना भव’</span> the Lord calls upon us to direct our mind to Him in the same way as the cowherdesses of Vraja thought ceaselessly of Him alone. <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">या दोहनेऽवहनने मथनोपलेप-</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रेङ्खेङ्खनार्भरुदितोक्षणमार्जनादौ ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">गायन्ति चैनमनुरक्तधियोऽश्रुकण्ठ्यो</p>
<p class="Shlok">धन्या व्रजस्त्रिय उरुक्रमचित्तयाना:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (X. xliv. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Blessed are the women of Vraja, who celebrate Him in song while milking their cows, pounding the corn, churning their curds, plastering their floor (with cowdung etc.), rocking the cradles, lulling their crying babes, sprinkling and sweeping their houses and attending to other such duties with a mind full of love and their throat choked with tears, (nay, all) whose movements are inspired by the thought of śrī Kr̥ṣṇa (who is no other than Lord Viṣṇu, who took long strides while measuring the three worlds during His descent as the Divine Dwarf).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To focus the mind on the Lord as indicated above is what is meant by seeking His protection with the mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By saying <span class="char-style-override-15">‘मद्भक्तो भव’</span> the Lord asks us mainly to direct our reason to Him. Intellectually grasping the reality and inwardness of His virtues and glory, which consist in cognizing that He alone is our greatest friend, extremely compassionate, supremely loving and benevolent, that none can compare with Him, and that the Lord alone is worth seeking the protection of, worthy of being recognized as one’s own and worth loving, one should treat Him alone as one’s own and bestow one’s exclusive and unalloyed love on Him alone in the same way as Prahlāda did. True Devotion merely consists in loving the Lord exclusively. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti-Sūtras</span> of sage śāṇdilya we read—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सा परानुरक्तिरीश्वरे।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Sūtra</span> 2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“<span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti</span> (Devotion) is supreme love for God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Directing one’s reason as pointed out above is what is meant by seeking the protection of the Lord through reason.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By saying <span class="char-style-override-15">‘मद्याजी भव’</span> (offer worship to me), the Lord seeks to convey that worship should be offered to Him recognizing the fact that He alone is the enjoyer of all sacrificial performances, austerities and other pursuits—<span class="char-style-override-15">‘भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसाम्’</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> V. 29), that He is the Self seated in the heart of all created beings, O Arjuna (<span class="char-style-override-15">‘अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थित:’ </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.,</span> X. 20) and that He alone pervades all <br/>(<span class="char-style-override-15">‘मया ततमिदं सर्वम्’ </span><span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.,</span> IX. 4). Later on the Lord Himself points out how worship should be offered to Him—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत: प्रवृत्तिर्भूतानां येन सर्वमिदं ततम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानव:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XVIII. 46)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Man attains the highest perfection by worshipping through his own natural duties Him from whom the tide of creation has streamed forth and by whom all this universe is pervaded.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To gratify all through service recognizing the Lord as indwelling all living beings and offering respect, attentions and honour with humility and love by means of one’s organs to all as so many images of God and guarding against pride and selfishness is what is meant by worship here. This is how comprehensive worship is offered to the Lord. While doing so one is mainly required to devote all one’s senses to the Lord. Hence by saying <span class="char-style-override-15">‘मद्याजी भव’</span> the Lord calls upon us to seek His protection by the senses.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The mandate <span class="char-style-override-15">‘मां नमस्कुरु’</span> (offer salutation to Me) is intended to call upon us to offer our body to the Lord. The idea is that one should have exclusive dependence on the Lord. One should rejoice, taking everything that the Lord does—whether it is agreeable or repulsive to our mind, in other words, whatever event, object or situation confronts us, no matter whether it is to our liking or distasteful to us—as a dispensation of God or a reward from Him and should continue to perceive His grace in that dispensation of His at every step. It is but natural to perceive His grace and find solace in an event, object or situation agreeable to one’s body, senses, mind, reason, scripture or creed; but he alone correctly comprehends the true import and inwardness of His compassion, who perceives His grace even in that which is repellent to him. The gratification and solace that one enjoys in an agreeable situation is experienced by all; but that is something <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span> (adulterated). That solace alone which continues as a result of one’s recognizing adversity as helpful to God-realization is <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> (or unmixed). On being confronted with an ailment distasteful to one’s mind or loss of a wife, progeny, fortune etc., a man should feel that even though the situation is distressing on the face of it, it has been brought about by God for his benefit and that it will conduce to his good in many ways. By undergoing suffering a man is purged of his sins and his heart gets purified. Misfortune puts one in mind of God. Once we recognize that the suffering undergone by us is an outcome of sin our proneness to sin gets arrested. Forbearance in suffering enhances our power of endurance. The solace one derives from such recognition is also <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span>. The mental peace in the form of God-realization or the supreme peace which transcends the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> or modes of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> is, however, different from all these types of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> peace. He who follows a course of discipline after recognizing this truth finds his delight in the pleasure of God, recognizing every event, object or situation that confronts him as a dispensation or decree of the Lord, and ever remains merged in peace. That is the highest peace. Such a man remains balanced in favourable and adverse circumstances; nay, he is completely rid for ever of anxiety and fear, delight and grief, partiality and prejudice, lust and anger, greed and infatuation and all other morbid affections and he continues to enjoy gratification, peace and joy everywhere at every step.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The aforesaid devotee of the Lord has already dedicated his mind, intellect, senses and bodywholly to the Lord; the grace of the Lord alone continues to be perceived by him in every action that comes to be performed through the instrumentality of his body, there being no doership in him. Therefore, whatever is done through his agency is done according to a hint from the Lord alone. Whatever the Lord gets done through him according to His own will, he remains equipoised in the midst of joy and sorrow, gain and loss, victory and defeat—whatever comes to him as a consequence of his action. Whatever is done through the agency of a man who has offered his all to the Lord is in conformity with the injunctions of the śāstras; no action which is repugnant to the spirit of the śāstras or useless is done by him; for all his activities are controlled by the Lord. Hence all the actions of that man are akin to the pastimes of the Lord. They are highly beneficial for the world too inasmuch as they are exemplary in character. Hence other man get liberated only by following them. It is with reference to such an exalted soul that the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā </span>III. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For whatsoever a great man does, that very thing other men also do; whatever standard he sets up, the generality of men follow the same.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In short it should be understood that he continues to perceive at every step the infinite and unbounded grace of the Lord in every event, object or circumstance that confronts him against his will (by the will of Providence) or through the will of another and even in all actions that are voluntarily done through the agency of his body. Realizing the presence of the Lord in all objects and beholding His pastimes in all actions, he continues to perceive His boundless grace and remains unaffected, equipoised, gratified, cheerful and tranquil under all circumstances.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To devote one’s mind, intellect, senses, body and all exclusively to the Lord in the aforesaid manner is what is meant by taking refuge solely in Him. To take refuge solely in the Lord and exclusive devotion to Him are, theoretically speaking, just the same. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, while talking of surrender, the Lord speaks of Devotion as a principal constituent of Surrender. In the verse analyzing the constituents of surrender, quoted in the previous issue, for example, the Lord refers to Devotion as a principal constituent by calling upon Arjuna to become a devotee. Similarly, in verses 54-55 of Discourse XI of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, the Lord speaks of exclusive Devotion in the following words—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञातुं द्रष्टुं च तत्त्वेन प्रवेष्टुं च परंतप॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XI. 54)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Through single minded devotion, however, I can be seen in this form (with four arms), and known in essence and even entered into, O valiant Arjuna.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">मत्कर्मकृन्मत्परमो मद्भक्त: सङ्गवर्जित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्वैर: सर्वभूतेषु य: स मामेति पाण्डव<span class="char-style-override-23">:</span>॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (XI. 55)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Arjuna, he who performs all his duties for My sake, depends on Me, is devoted to Me, has no attachment, and is free from malice towards all beings, reaches Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to point out what is meant by exclusive Devotion in the latter of the two verses the Lord speaks of Surrender as a principal constituent of Devotion by characterizing a devotee inter <span class="char-style-override-10">alia as</span> <span class="char-style-override-15">मत्परम</span>:—(thoroughly dependent on the Lord). From this it should be concluded that Exclusive Surrender and Exclusive Devotion are, really speaking, one and the same.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A devotee of God who takes refuge solely in the Lord as aforesaid is rid of fear in everyway and at every place. He fears none. The messengers of Death and others dare not even approach him. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Viṣṇu-Purāṇa</span> Bhīṣma says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">किंकरा: पाशदण्डाश्च न यमो न च यातना:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">समर्थास्तस्य यस्यात्मा केशवालम्बन: सदा॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (III. vii. 38)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Neither Yama (the god of punishment) nor his servants, noose and staff, nor even his tortures prevail over him whose mind ever hangs on śrī Kr̥ṣṇa (the Ruler even of Brahmā and Lord śiva).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Recapitulating in this context to the highminded Nakula the instructions given by Yama to his messengers, Bhīṣma points out in some detail the characteristics of a devotee, which are worth studying, pondering and imbibing. Neither Yama (the god of punishment) nor his messengers have any access to the place where such a devotee of the Lord is breathing his last, Bhīṣma says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वपुरुषमभिवीक्ष्य पाशहस्तं</p>

<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-17">Love All Equally in a Disinterested Spirit for God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is all love and consciousness. Although love, beloved and lover are stated to be distinct terms and entities, the reality is that God alone is manifest in all the three forms. When a lover of God attains God, he gets absorbed in Him; he is no longer recognized as distinct from God. God alone is the beloved of all, while Love constitutes His very being. It is just the same whether we say that Love alone stands manifested in the triple form of love, beloved and lover or that God alone exists in these forms—even as earrings, necklace, bangles and so on have distinct names and forms only, while essentially all is gold.</p>
<p class="Gadya"> यथा सोम्यैकेन लोहमणिना सर्वं लोहमयं विज्ञातॸस्वाद् वाचारम्भणं विकारो नामधेयं लोहमित्येव सत्यम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Chāndogya.</span> VI. i. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Says Uddālaka to his son, śwetaketu—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“My good son, just as when the one substance, <span class="char-style-override-10">viz.</span>, gold (the best of all metals) is known, everything made of gold is fully known; for a modification is only a name, hanging on speech alone. Gold alone is real.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly, so far as common parlance goes, love, beloved and lover are distinct terms and concepts. Really speaking, however, Love and Love alone exists and this Love is the same as God, spiritual and transcendental. Earthly love is a mere reflection of a ray of this Love, which is synonymous with God. Hence it should not be termed as love but should be designated as attachment or affection.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Exclusive and unmixed love for God makes for speedy God-realization. Exclusive love is that which is not directed towards anyone other than God; while ‘unmixed’ Love is that which is free from any other desire—is fully disinterested. For developing this genuine love strivers should look upon all as so many manifestations of God. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">वासुदेव: सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभ:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VII. 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the very last of all births, the man of realization worships Me, realizing that all this is God. Such a great soul is very rare.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If it is not possible to recognize all as so many manifestations of God, one should at least conclude that the Lord is present in all. Says the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (VI. 30)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who sees Me (the Universal Self) present in all beings, and sees all beings existing within Me, never loses sight of Me, nor do I lose sight of him.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If we fail to arrive at this conclusion either, we can develop love for God and attain God-realization even by rendering service to all taking everything as belonging to Him. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत: प्रवृत्तिर्भूतानां येन सर्वमिदं ततम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्वकर्मणा तमभ्यर्च्य सिद्धिं विन्दति मानव:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XVIII. 46)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Man attains the highest perfection by worshipping through his own natural duties Him from whom the tide of creation has streamed forth and by whom all this universe is pervaded.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, if we love all in a disinterested spirit viewing all alike, it is as good as loving God Himself. It is natural for exalted souls of a high order to look upon all with the same eye, while a striver has to develop this even-mindedness through effort and culture. Hence a striver should emulate such exalted souls. The even-mindedness of exalted souls has been described as follows in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The wise look with the same eye on a <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span> endowed with learning and culture, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a pariah too.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">‘Recognizing as equal’ is what is meant by ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">Samadarśana</span>’ in the abovequoted verse. What is inculcated in the above verse is ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">Samadarśana</span>’ and not ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">Samavartana</span>’ (treating alike); for it is not even possible to treat all alike. Treatment can be meted out only according to rules of propriety. The milk of a cow alone is fit for human consumption; that of a bitch or a she-elephant cannot be used as human food. An elephant or horse alone can be used for riding, not a cow nor a dog. The removal of night-soil can be got done only by a sweeper and not by a learned and pious <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span>. Grass can be given as food only to a cow or an elephant and not to a dog, a pariah or a <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span>. Again we assign to our head the same place of honour as we do to a <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span> in the Hindu society, to our arms a place corresponding to the position of a <span class="char-style-override-10">Kṣatriya</span>, to the thighs a place similar to the position occupied in the Hindu social structure by a <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> and to our feet a position corresponding to the status of a <span class="char-style-override-10">śūdra</span>. We bow our head at the feet of or join our palms before a man to whom we intend to show special reverence; and we join our palms by way of apology before a man whom we happen to touch with our foot by mistake. Even though we use our limbs differently in this way, our feeling of mineness and love for each one of them is just the same—it does not vary in anyway. Similarly, even though we should treat all differently according to their deserts, our feeling of identity with them, our consciousness of their being so many manifestations of God and our feeling of love for them should be uniform. Exalted souls naturally cherish the same feeling towards all living beings; hence they alone are worthy of eulogy. Says the Lord in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृन्मित्रार्युदासीनमध्यस्थद्वेष्यबन्धुषु।</p>
<p class="Shlok">साधुष्वपि च पापेषु समबुद्धिर्विशिष्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VI. 9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who looks upon well-wishers and neutrals as well as mediators, friends and foes, relatives and objects of hatred, the virtuous and the sinful with the same eye stands supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Ordinary men bear ill-will towards an enemy and cherish love for their friend. A friend evokes love and an enemy evokes hatred. A man whose mind is set on piety evokes love, while a sinner evokes hatred. One’s relations and kinsmen evoke love, while others evoke hatred or a feeling of indifference. Exalted souls who have realized God, however, always cherish the same feeling towards all; they never make any distinction in the case of any individual. Hence we should love all equally in a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Love which is bestowed on any living being whatsoever in a disinterested spirit, in obedience to the injunctions of God, with a view to God-realization or earning His pleasure or for His sake alone results in God-realization itself. Hence to recognize all as so many manifestations of God or to look upon God as present in all or to regard everything as belonging to God—whichever of these three ideals is agreeable to an individual, whichever evokes his or her reverence and catches his or her fancy, is supreme for him or her. Adopting that very ideal, he or she should love all.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Some time back it was seen that strivers got pleased and transported with joy to see a fellow striver and thought highly of him. They never belittled him. Their fellow striver appeared to them as excelling them in devotion, spiritual enlightenment, dispassion, virtues and good conduct and they wished to see these transplanted in themselves. Nowadays, however, many people are censorious towards their fellow strivers and see faults alone in them; this is evidently a road to degradation. That is why a majority of strivers do not make headway in their spiritual endeavour.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Being a concept of God alone, this entire cosmos is just the same as God. Therefore, if, recognizing all as so many manifestations of God, we serve all in an unegotistic and disinterested spirit, it is no doubt a most excellent spiritual discipline. If, however, we fail to recognize all as so many manifestations of God, the notion that God is all-pervading as ether is of course quite logical and consistent with the findings of the scriptures, and we should naturally conceive all living beings, nay, the whole of the animate and inanimate creation as permeated by God. He who comes to recognize this can never do any harm to another; on the other hand, he naturally begins develop even-mindedness and love towards all. It is certain that ill-will towards another grows only when we are censorious towards him or her and love follows as a matter of course where there is good opinion about another. Whatever living being comes before us, to say nothing of man, we should feel delighted recognizing it to be permeated by God. Faults we should see only in ourselves in order to correct ourselves. Faults do not stand our gaze. We should entertain a good opinion only about others, and should not be censorious towards them. We stand much to lose by being hyper critical about others. Faults are like filth. A cloth or limb gets polluted on coming into touch with filth. If we see the faults of others with our eyes, our eyes get polluted; if we hear about them with our ears, our ears get defiled; if we talk of others’ faults with our tongue, our tongue gets polluted and if we dwell on others’ faults with our mind, our mind gets defiled. Getting polluted by contact with others’ faults in this way one becomes dirty and goes down in the scale of human evolution.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Nay, there are many other evils in mentioning, hearing, seeing and dwelling on others’ faults—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) If we entertain a bad opinion about others we begin to hate them and our self-esteem grows, which is exceedingly harmful.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) By reviling others and hearing them being reviled we outrage the feelings of the man whom we revile or hear being reviled and thereby incur sin.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) As a sequel to our dwelling on, seeing, hearing and speaking of others’ faults the impressions of those faults get imprinted on our heart in the form of seeds which develop in due course into a tree and make of us an abode of those very faults.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) By criticizing, hearing and speaking of others’ faults we have to share the sin of that sinner, or in other words, to share the consequences of that sin.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Taking all these facts into consideration a man would be well-advised never to observe, criticize, ponder, speak or hear of others’ faults, vices, immoral conduct or evil addictions; for all these actions are sinful, most harmful and degrading. Hence a seeker of beatitude should eschew them in everyway; for so long as these evil habits persist hatred alone must grow, love for all being out of the question. Love is possible only when a good opinion is entertained about others.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even if a man loves anyone with an interested motive, he achieves his end in the world, enjoys fame and attains heaven after death. If, however, love is extended equally to all in a disinterested spirit, God-realization itself follows.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If anyone loves us, we must reciprocate his love under all circumstances; for, to say nothing of man, even birds and beasts love those who love them. Strivers, however, should love all. They should love even those who do not love them. On the other hand, they should bestow love alone even on those who hate them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to cultivate love towards all and develop it one should serve all in an unegotistic and disinterested spirit, to gratify them in everyway and, entertaining a good opinion about them, to perceive, ponder, mention and celebrate their virtues alone. Thereby love can be evoked in the highest and the lowest individual. Love is automatically evoked in God through service to Him and singing His praises, in exalted souls through service to them and singing their praises and in a common man through service to him and celebrating his virtues. The long and short of it is that if we render services to, gratify and celebrate the real virtues even of a wicked, sinful and vile man, love can be evoked even in him, much more in others. Nay, we should render good offices even to him who illtreats us, harms us or does a disservice to us. Even though Dhr̥tarāṣṭra, for example, contrived to burn Kuntī alive with her sons in the city of Vāraṇāvata and repeatedly wronged her. Kuntī, for her part, served Dhr̥tarāṣṭra and his wife, Gāndhārī, all their life, forgetting their wrong-doing (vide <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata,  di</span>., CXLIV—CXLVII; <span class="char-style-override-10">sramavāsika</span>., I-II, XVXIX). Following this conduct of Kuntī as our ideal, let us also render good offices even to him who has done a disservice to us.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whoever comes up before us, whomsoever we meet, let us serve him in a disinterested spirit, thinking at the same time how his interests may be served. Nay, let us feel enraptured, delighted and transported with joy to observe his good points and let us appreciate his virtues alone. There is no one in this world who is full of faults alone and devoid of any virtue; nor is there anyone other than God and exalted souls who has virtues alone and not a single fault.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, as a matter of principle, a man should make it his goal to love all equally in a disinterested spirit. With this end in view, one should unegotistically and selflessly behave with humility and love towards all. Love bestowed on anyone for the pleasure of God is love bestowed on God. Therefore, strivers would do well to develop disinterested love towards all for the pleasure of God, looking upon all as so many manifestations of God or viewing God as present in all or recognizing everything as belonging to God. All sorts of evils will be completely eradicated thereby and realization of God, who is the same as Supreme Love, will take place. That is why Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa says to His loving devotee, Uddhava—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-18">The Various Means of God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The goal of human existence is realization of God. The scriptures, saints and <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahātmās</span> have laid down various means for the same. Through the practice of any of these scriptural methods, according to one’s qualification and temperament, in a disinterested way, i.e., without the motive of gaining worldly happiness, and merely for the sake of God’s pleasure, man may in due course realize God and fulfil the object of his birth and existence. Lord Manu has laid down the ten characteristics of <span class="char-style-override-10">Dharma</span>. Anyone who disinterestedly practises these ten aspects of <span class="char-style-override-10">Dharma</span> may attain freedom from the bondage of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>, and realize God.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-1" xml:lang="en-US">The Ten Ways</p>
<p class="Shlok">धृति: क्षमा दमोऽस्तेयं शौचमिन्द्रियनिग्रह:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">धीर्विद्या सत्यमक्रोधो दशकं धर्मलक्षणम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The ten characteristics of <span class="char-style-override-10">Dharma</span> are Fortitude, Forgiveness, Mind-control, Non-theft, Purity of body and mind, Sense-control, Wisdom, Knowledge, Truth and Non-anger.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Briefly explained, they are as follows—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. Fortitude means firmness of character in the face of danger or failure in obtaining a desired thing. He who practises fortitude can save his <span class="char-style-override-10">Dharma</span>, and attains success in this world and the next.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. Forgiveness is expressed through patient bearing of another’s persecution without entertaining the least thought of retaliation, although possessing full power of retaliation, and making proper effort to change the attitude of the persecutor and remove for all time his propensity for the commission of guilt.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-10">Dama</span> ordinarily means control of the senses, but sense-control having been covered by another word in the verse, it should be taken in the sense of ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">śama</span>’ or mind-control. Without control over the mind God-realization is almost an impossibility (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> vi, 36). The Lord has said that the mind can be brought under control through discipline and practice of dispassion (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span><span class="char-style-override-17">vi</span>. 35). </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. Non-theft means non-commission of any form of theft, through mind, speech and body.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5. Purification, both external and internal. Honest means and trade in pure things for livelihood, purity of food gained through honest livelihood, purity of conduct and cleaning of the body through the use of water, earth, etc., are called external purity. Attainment of transparency of the mind through total removal of modifications like attraction and hatred, hypocrisy and falsehood, enmity and pride, etc., is called internal purity.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">6. Sense-control means not allowing the senses to run after objects of sight, taste, sound, smell and touch of their own accord, their withdrawal from harmful objects and application to beneficial objects.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">7. Wisdom is the highest <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type of intelligence, born of the study of elevated scriptures, practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhajana</span> and investigation into the character of Self, through which the mind gets attached to God and true knowledge is awakened.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">8. Knowledge is that spiritual knowledge which God has described as identical with Him, and which liberating man from the bondage of nescience brings the attainment of the supreme state.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">9. Truth is statement of facts, as they are, in words which are pleasant. Whatever the mind and the senses have ascertained as fact has to be expressed in sweet words, bearing in mind that it does not lead to injury to any innocent creature. The characteristics of truth are that it conforms to fact, is pleasant, untainted by deceit and non-injurious to every being.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">10. Non-anger means want of the least trace of fire in the mind even against one who causes injury. The difference between non-anger and forgiveness lies in this that in the former there is no action; it is a passive state of bearing everything, without allowing the mind to undergo any modification. But this does not necessarily mean forgiveness of the guilt of the wrong-doer, who reaps the fruit of his action, either in this world or the next, through the operation of God’s justice and dispensation. In forgiveness, the guilt is altogether forgiven.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-2" xml:lang="en-US">THE NINE WAYS</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If one is unable to utilize the ten ways mentioned above, he may try to realize God through the nine forms of practice known as the nine forms of devotion. These are as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णो: स्मरणं पादसेवनम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> VII. v. 23)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Hearing of the Names and description of the Form, Virtues and Glory of Lord Viṣṇu, Loud chanting (<span class="char-style-override-10">Kīrtana</span>) practice of Remembrance, Serving the Lord’s sacred feet, Worship, Prostration before Him, Cultivation of the Servant-sentiment (towards God), Cultivation of the Friend-sentiment and surrender these are the nine forms of devotion.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">1. Hearing</span>—This form of devotion is cultivated through the constant practice of hearing with reverence of God’s character, glories, virtues, sports, names and love, and attempting to mould conduct accordingly. By mere hearing of the <span class="char-style-override-10">‘śrīmad Bhāgavata’ </span>a sinner like Dhundhukārī crossed the ocean of existence. As a devotee, king Parīkṣit is considered to belong to this class.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">2. Kīrtana</span>—This is loud chanting of God’s sports, power, glory, character, virtues, names etc., filling the heart with the sentiment of love. Devarṣi Nārada, Vyāsadeva, Vālmīki, śukadeva and śrī Caitanya, etc., are considered to be devotees of this class. </p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">3. Remembrance</span>—This is the practice of exclusive remembrance of the divine form with all its virtues and glory and feeling, again and again, charmed with it. śrī Prahlāda, śrī Dhruva, śrī Bharata, Bhīṣma and the Gopīs are devotees of this class.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">4. Serving the Lord’s feet</span>—This is either service of the feet of the divine form, which is the object of worship of the devotee, or service of the feet of every being regarding him to be the abode of the Lord. śrī Lakṣmī, śrī Rukmiṇī and śrī Bharata are devotees of this class.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">5. Worship</span>—This is offering of constant worship to either a particular image of God or to a divine form conceived in the mind, according to the liking or inclination of the devotee. For the details of the practice of mental worship, the reader is referred to the article entitled “Lessons in Devotion and Divine Love” appearing in the Kalyana-Kalpataru, May 1944. Rendering service to all beings regarding them as divine manifestations is also a form of worship of Unmanifest God. Kings like Pr̥thu and Ambarīṣa belong to this class of devotees.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">6. Salutation</span>—This form of devotion is cultivated through offering of salutations to an image of God, or to all beings, regarding the universe itself as God’s image. śrī Akrūra is classified as a devotee of this type.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">7. The Servant-sentiment</span>—This is expressed through constant service rendered to God by a devotee with utmost reverence and faith, regarding God as the sole Lord and Master and himself as God’s eternal servant, without entertaining any worldly desire, and treating the joy of salvation as quite insignificant in comparison with the delight of personal service to God. śrī Hanumān, śrī Lakṣmījī, etc., are devotees of this class.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">8. The Friend-sentiment</span>—This is offering of love to God with an open heart, regarding Him to be the best friend and well-wisher. God performs even the humblest service of His friend with very great pleasure. śrī Arjuna, Uddhava, Sudāmā, śrīdāmā and others are devotees of this class.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"><span class="char-style-override-12">9. Self-surrender</span>—It means, being freed from the  ego, offering everything which one may call as one’s own, to God. <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahārāja</span> Bali and the Gopīs are examples of this type of devotion.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-3" xml:lang="en-US">THE EIGHT WAYS</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">(a) <span class="char-style-override-10">Ahiṁsā</span> is the practice of refraining from infliction causing to inflict or supporting infliction of the least amount of pain and injury, through mind, speech and body, to any being whatsoever under the influence of greed, infatuation or anger.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">(c) Non-theft is the practice of ever refraining through mind, speech and body from taking possession of anything belonging to another.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(d) Total abstinence from the eight forms of sexual indulgence is <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmacarya</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(e) The practice of non-possession means refraining wholly from accumulation of things for the purpose of enjoyment, or refraining from accumulation of things with the sense of personal possession.</p>

The power of the mind is developed, so as to make it ripe for the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Dhāraṇā</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5. <span class="char-style-override-12">Pratyāhāra—</span>Through dissociation of the senses from their corresponding objects, their transformation or absorption into the mind is called the state of <span class="char-style-override-10">Pratyāhāra</span>.

<p class="TEXT-English">6. <span class="char-style-override-12">Dhāraṇā—</span>Fixing of the mind on one object is called <span class="char-style-override-10">Dhāraṇā</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">7. <span class="char-style-override-12">Dhyāna—</span>Flow of all the mental faculties towards the object of meditation, similar to the uninterrupted or incessant flow of oil, is called <span class="char-style-override-10">Dhyāna</span> or meditation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">8. <span class="char-style-override-12">Samādhi—</span>When <span class="char-style-override-10">Dhyāna</span> or meditation becomes complete, the triangular difference between the meditator, act of meditation and the object of meditation is removed, and a state of identity is established, which is called the state of <span class="char-style-override-10">Samādhi</span>. This is, again divided into two types, e.g., with seed and seedless. In the first type of <span class="char-style-override-10">Samādhi</span> with seed, though the triangular difference is lost, the seeds of subtle impressions or latencies remain; whereas in seedless <span class="char-style-override-10">Samādhi</span> there is total annihilation of even the subtle impressions.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-12">Association—</span>It means good association. The benefit which man derives from the association of saints and lovers of God, and scriptures dealing with God, cannot be properly described. The greatness and glory of God can be understood only from such association. It is through the influence of <span class="char-style-override-10">Satsaṅga</span> alone that the darkness of ignorance of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Jīva</span> is removed. Goswāmī Tulasīdāsajī says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Except in the company of saints there is no talk about Hari; without this talk ignorance will not be dispelled; and without dispelling ignorance, it is not possible to develop strong attachment for the feet of śrī Rāma.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O dear, if heavenly enjoyments and the bliss of absolution (<span class="char-style-override-10">Mukti</span>) are placed on the same scale of the balance; they combined cannot equal the joy of a moment’s association with a saint.”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“In comparison with a moment’s contact with a lover of God, we consider the attainment of heaven or even salvation (Mokṣa) as quite insignificant, what to speak of other worldly things.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Himself, addressing śrī Uddhava says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">But, it is necessary, to consider what should be the characteristics of the Sādhu whose company should be cultivated for <span class="char-style-override-10">Satsaṅga</span>. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, chapter II, contains the marks of a man of stable mind. Similarly, chapter XII contains the marks of the devotee, and chapter XIV the marks of one, who has risen above the <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span>. He in whom these marks are developed in a more or less pronounced form is a saint in the real sense of the term. Describing, again, the marks of a saint, śrī Kapiladeva says to his mother in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhāgavata</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तितिक्षव: कारुणिका: सुहृद: सर्वदेहिनाम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अजातशत्रव: शान्ता: साधव: साधुभूषणा:॥</p>

<p class="Shlok">सङ्गस्तेष्वथ ते प्रार्थ्य: सङ्गदोषहरा हि ते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (III. xxv. 21—24)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O mother, Sādhus who are full of forbearance and mercy, friends to all embodied beings, and enemies to none and are tranquil, who possess good disposition, as their ornament and cherish firm devotion to Me (God) with an unswerving heart and have renounced all works and even their kith and kin for My sake, have taken refuge under Me and regard My stories as sweet and are constantly engaged in either listening to or telling My stories, and whose mind is set on Me, are not harassed by the afflictions of the world. They are the people who are rid of all attachments and can cure the evil of worldly attachments in others. O virtuous lady, their association should be cultivated.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, <span class="char-style-override-10">Satsaṅga</span> should be sought after with constant love and faith even at the risk of great loss in worldly pursuits.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. <span class="char-style-override-12">Bhajana—</span>Goswāmī Tulasīdāsajī says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बारि मथें घृत होइ बरु सिकता ते बरु तेल।</p>
<p class="Shlok">बिन हरि भजन न भव तरिअ यह सिद्धांत अपेल॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Butter may be rather churned out of water, and oil may be pressed out of sand; but without the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhajana</span> none can cross the ocean of existence; this truth is unshakable.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The statement is absolutely correct. Practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhajana</span> is the primary means of crossing the ocean of metempsychosis. When this is done, all other qualifications follow as a matter of course. It is through the power of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhajana</span>, devotees like Dhruva, Prahlāda and Mīrā, etc., that God blessed them with His sight.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-12">Service—</span>It is man’s primary duty to render service in any form or shape to another being. Regarding the whole world as the manifestation of God, one should render disinterested service to all through the mind, speech and body. When an opportunity of service occurs, it should be regarded as a favour done by God as well as the person who receives the service. For the latter by accepting the service, and God by creating the opportunity of service, show us exceptional favour, indeed. By rendering service to another, one should neither feel that he has conferred an obligation nor regard the recipient of service as in anyway inferior.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. <span class="char-style-override-12">Kindness—</span>Melting of the heart at the sight of misery of a distressed being and awakening in the mind of the desire to remove his misery is called kindness. Ahiṁsā or non-violence is a negative or passive quality, and kindness is positive and active. Ahiṁsā means only restraint from doing injury, but kindness involves doing something so as to contribute to the happiness of another. The heart of the person who possesses no kindness is like a piece of hard stone. Human life should be made a success through the exhibition of kindness to the indigent, the cripple, the diseased and the helpless. Mahāprabhu śrī Caitanya expressed his entire teachings in a nutshell by pointing, in conclusion, to three things only—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नामे रुचि जीवे दया वैष्णवसेवन।</p>
<p class="Shlok">इहा छाड़ा आर नाहिं जानि सनातन॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Sanātana! taste in the Name of God, kindness to beings, and association of devotees—beyond these three, I know of no other way.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5. <span class="char-style-override-12">Meditation—</span>The very key to unlock the gate leading to God-vision is meditation. When the first attempt to meditation is made, the mind being not broken to it will feel tired and worried, but if the practice is resolutely continued daily and regularly, the mind will be habituated to the practice. Then the joy, which meditation will bring will be found in no other work. Therefore, meditation on the form of one’s cherished deity should be practised daily with a resolute heart. The practice of meditation is the best of all means.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">6. <span class="char-style-override-12">Humility—</span>Pride is the one enemy of man, which inevitably leads to his fall. If he can replace it by cultivating humility, and being meek and lowly before God, he can certainly draw the compassion of God on him. Therefore, humility should be cultivated abandoning all forms of crookedness and twists of character.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">7. <span class="char-style-override-12">Benevolence—</span>It is said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अष्टादशपुराणेषु व्यासस्य वचनद्वयम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">परोपकार: पुण्याय पापाय परपीडनम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In all the eighteen <span class="char-style-override-10">Purāṇas</span>, <span class="char-style-override-10">Maharṣi Vedavyāsa </span>inculcated only two teachings, viz., benevolence is the cause of virtue, and tyranny the cause of sin.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswāmī Tulasīdāsajī also says—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“There is no virtue equal to benevolence, and nothing so despicable as tyranny. For a man possessing benevolence in his heart, there is nothing unattainable in the world.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, one should constantly devote oneself to the practice of benevolence renouncing pride, selfishness and desire.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-5" xml:lang="en-US">THE SIX WAYS</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the seven ways mentioned above cannot be practised, the six ways described below should be adopted and followed realization of God is possible through their disinterested practice.</p>
<p class="Shlok">संध्या, पूजा, यज्ञ, तप, दया सु-सात्त्विक दान।</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन छ: के आचरणसे निश्चय हो कल्यान॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The six practices of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyā</span>, adoration, sacrifice, askesis, compassion and charities of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type lead to blessedness without fail.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-12">Sandhyā—</span>Every twice-born should practise <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyā</span> three times a day. In case three times of practice is not possible, there should be no failure at least in the performance of the morning and evening <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyās</span>. Through the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyā</span>, God is worshipped in the forms of sun, fire and water. Lord Manu says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न तिष्ठति तु य: पूर्वां नोपास्ते यश्च पश्चिमाम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स शूद्रवद्‍बहिष्कार्य: सर्वस्माद् द्विजकर्मण:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The twice-born who fails in the performance of the morning and evening <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyās</span>, should be kept at a distance like the <span class="char-style-override-10">śūdra</span> in all works enjoined for the twice-born.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, the practice of Sandhyā should never be abandoned. During periods of uncleanliness caused by the birth or death of a relative, or journey by rail, Sandhyā should be mentally performed. The times fixed for the performance should be kept up.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These times are as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उत्तमा तारकोपेता मध्यमा लुप्ततारका।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कनिष्ठा सूर्यसहिता प्रात:सन्ध्या त्रिधा स्मृता॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">उत्तमा सूर्यसहिता मध्यमा लुप्तभास्करा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कनिष्ठा तारकोपेता सायंसन्ध्या त्रिधा स्मृता॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Devī-Bhāgavata</span> XI. xvi. 4-5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“There are three types of morning Sandhyā, the best is performed when there are stars in the sky, the middling is performed when stars are invisible, the worst is performed after sun-rise. Similarly, evening <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyā</span> is of three types, the best is performed before sun-set, the middling is after sun-set, and the worst after stars are visible.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the morning, God approaches our continent in the form of the sun, and in the evening goes to another part of the world. Just as when an honoured guest comes to us we make arrangements for his reception before his arrival, go to the station before the train arrives and stand waiting on the platform with flowers and bouquets to welcome and salute him, and when he leaves us, make all necessary arrangements for his departure and go to the station to bid him farewell, even so obeisances are offered to the sun through the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyā</span> for which the right time should be observed. Through the practice of adoration in the form of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sandhyā</span> all sins are dispelled, and, finally, God can be realized. If we offer our reception and farewell to the sun disinterestedly throughout life regularly both the times, then on our death, the sun also will be compelled to help us in our liberation from bondage.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The scripture says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सन्ध्यामुपासते ये तु सततं संशितव्रता:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विधूतपापास्ते यान्ति ब्रह्मलोकं सनातनम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The twice-born who resolutely performs Sandhyā regularly everyday, being released from sin, attains the eternal abode of Brahmā.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. <span class="char-style-override-12">Adoration—</span>External or mental worship of the image of the Deity should be performed by all regularly everyday. In every home there should be either an image or a picture of the Deity to whom women and children may offer their worship. This will create good mental impressions and develop the spirit of devotion in them. Mīrābāī and <span class="char-style-override-10">Dhannā</span>, the Jāṭa, and others became famous devotees only through the practice of adoration.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-12">Sacrifice—</span>The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> has described many forms of sacrifice, and among them God has described the sacrifice consisting of Japa as His very Self <span class="char-style-override-14">‘यज्ञानां जपयज्ञोऽस्मि’</span> (X.25). Therefore, <span class="char-style-override-10">Japa</span> of the Divine Name should be practised by all. Since man generally takes, in the course of a day and night, 21,600 breaths, that number of utterance of the Name of God should be practised without fail. Inaudible or <span class="char-style-override-10">Upāṁśu Japa</span> is the best of all. Besides this, it is indispensable for a householder to perform the five great obligatory sacrifices. At least, there should be no lapse in the performance of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Balivaiśwadeva</span>, the rules of which will be elsewhere described.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. <span class="char-style-override-12">Askesis—</span>To undergo suffering in the practice of one’s particular <span class="char-style-override-10">Dharma</span> is askesis. In chapter XVII, verses 14 to 19 of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, austerities of the body, mind and speech are described, in following which the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> form of austerity should be performed.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5. <span class="char-style-override-12">Compassion—</span>The <span class="char-style-override-10">Smr̥ti</span> says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">परे वा बन्धुवर्गे वा मित्रे द्वेष्टरि वा सदा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आपन्ने रक्षितव्यं तु दयैषा परिकीर्तिता॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Atri Smr̥ti</span> 41)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Whether a person is a relative or a stranger, a friend or a foe, when he is a victim of misery, attempt should be made to remove the same. This is called compassion.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">At the sight of another’s distress, the heart of a man of compassion will at once melt. It is said, “Compassion is the root of virtue, and the root of sin is pride; says Tulasī, so long as there is breath in the body, do not give up compassion.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">6. <span class="char-style-override-12">Charity—</span>The practice of charity is the common duty of man. Wealth, learning, intelligence, food, water, cloth, good words, whatever of these one may possess should be gifted away to the proper person at the proper place and time, and the gift should be made in the purest <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> spirit. A gift made without consideration of the propriety of place, time and person, without welcome to the recipient, and in a spirit of reproach to him, is a <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span> form of gift. And the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span> forms of gift are made with mental unwillingness, in a spirit of receiving something in return, or for gaining honour, fame, prestige, or progeny, for removal of illness or for the attainment of happiness in the heaven. The gift which is made as a matter of duty, without any sense of return, and after proper consideration of the place, time and person is the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type of gift. This last type of gift acts as a great help in one’s progress towards God-realization. If one possesses a thing for the lack of which other persons are suffering in a particular place and time, then the service rendered to those persons in that place and time by making them gifts of that thing, is called practice of charity after due consideration of the place and time. The hungry, the helpless, the distressed and generally all indigent beggars are always worthy subjects of charity to whom services should be rendered by supplying them with food, clothing, medicine, or whatever else they may require. The value of a gift does not depend on the amount of money spent, but on the spirit or motive of the giver. The greater the sacrifice involved in a gift, the more is its value. That is why in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Aśwamedha Parva of the Mahābhārata,</span> the mongoose reproved the unlimited charities performed by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Pāṇḍavas </span>and praised the value of the gift of a handful of parched grain made by a poor <span class="char-style-override-10">Brāhmaṇa</span> who lived by gleaning corn. (<span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata</span>, <span class="char-style-override-10">Aśwa</span>. 90. 7). A person gives away a lakh of rupees out of his accumulated balance of crores of rupees in order to earn name and fame, or from any other selfish motive, and another poor individual parts with, from a sense of duty, half a piece of bread and goes empty in stomach himself. Out of these two, the gift of the latter is more valuable. Nevertheless, charity performed in a good cause even with a motive, is better than total absence of the practice of charity.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-6" xml:lang="en-US">THE FIVE WAYS</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the six ways mentioned above cannot be practised, one may take to the following five ways. The practice of these five also may bring one the attainment of the supreme object of life.</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">The grace of these five quickly brings</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God-realization.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-12">Gāyatrī—</span>The scriptures sing the glory of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gāyatrī</span> in the highest of terms. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Japa</span> of <span class="char-style-override-10">Gāyatrī</span> has to be performed observing bodily purity and silence adding the <span class="char-style-override-10">Praṇava</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Vyāhr̥ti </span>to the formula. The formula of <span class="char-style-override-10">Gāyatrī</span> contains the praise of All-pervading <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss, and meditation on His Divine Light and a prayer to Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Lord Manu writes the glory of the Gāyatrī in the following terms—</p>

He who, abandoning idleness, performs the Japa of <span class="char-style-override-10">Gāyatrī</span>, regularly everyday, for three years at a stretch, becomes as light of speed as air, and as stainless as ether, and attains Supreme <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>.”</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-12">The Cow—</span>The Hindu scriptures glorify the cow in highest terms. Through service of the cow all desires of men can be fulfilled. The five products of the cow, <span class="char-style-override-10">viz.</span>, milk, curd, ghee (clarified butter) urine and dung are pure and destructive of sins. The number of cows is being reduced in India nowadays with extreme cruelty. All religious-minded men, who seek the country’s welfare, should make it a point to protect and serve the cow.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. <span class="char-style-override-12">The Gītā—</span>The <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is, indeed, the very heart of God. Bhagavān śrī Vyāsa says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">गीता सुगीता कर्तव्या किमन्यै: शास्त्रविस्तरै:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">या स्वयं पद्मनाभस्य मुखपद्माद्विनि:सृता<span class="char-style-override-23">:</span>॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata, Bhīṣma</span>-<span class="char-style-override-10">Parva</span> 43.1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Emanating from the lotus-like lips of God Himself, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> alone should be studied well. What is the use of studying so many scriptures?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How can one express the glory of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>? It can only be felt by one, who devotes himself to a study of it with attention. There are many verses in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, half or even a quarter of whose instructions, when reduced to practice, may easily bring one God-realization. It has been said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वोपनिषदो गावो दोग्धा गोपालनन्दन:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">पार्थो वत्स: सुधीर्भोक्ता दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The entire range of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Upaniṣads</span> constitutes the cow, the milker is the divine cowherd śrī Kr̥ṣṇa, Arjuna is the calf, the wise man of intelligence is the enjoyer and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> is the nectar-like milk.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> should be read with attention everyday, as an unfailing duty, properly understanding the meaning of the verses studied.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5. <span class="char-style-override-12">Ganges-bath—</span>The glory of the Ganges is infinite. She is, in fact, styled by the devotees as liquid <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>, That is, <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> Itself transformed into water from its formless state, and flowing as a stream. It is stated by the scriptures at numberless places that through bath in the Ganges, and drinking of its water, sins are eradicated and liberation is attained. Even today, there is hardly a place found as pure and sacred as the bank of the Ganges. There are many great saints who live only on the bank of the Ganges. Western medical experts after analysing the water of the Ganges have declared that it contains natural prophylactic properties and disease germs coming in contact with it are at once destroyed. It is well-known that Ganges water even if preserved for years does not rot. It is the established view of the scriptures that he who resorts to the Ganges and bathes in it and drinks its water, with reverence and faith, attains the supreme state.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-7" xml:lang="en-US">THE FOUR WAYS</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the five ways mentioned above cannot be adopted for practice, one may take recourse to the four ways mentioned below—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Self-restraint, service, spiritual practices and association of saints—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">These four, when adopted, quickly chase away the night of delusion.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-12">Self-restraint—</span>Disallowing the mind, speech and body to acts they like, and withdrawing them from enjoyments of the world, and to devote them to practices which lead to blessedness is called practice of self-restraint. According to Lord Manu, he who keeps restraint over the mind, speech and body is a <span class="char-style-override-10">Tridaṇḍī</span> in the true sense of the term—</p>
<p class="Shlok">वाग्दण्डोऽथ मनोदण्ड: कायदण्डस्तथैव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्यैते निहिता बुद्धौ त्रिदण्डीति स उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">त्रिदण्डमेतन्निक्षिप्यसर्वभूतेषु मानव।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कामक्रोधौ तु संयम्य तत: सिद्धिं नियच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XII. 10-11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who carefully practises control over speech, control over the mind and control over the body is a <span class="char-style-override-10">Tridaṇḍī</span> (bearer of three staffs, an ascetic). He, who has attained restraint over mind, speech and the body with reference to all beings, and for the exercise of this restraint has brought under control his lust and anger, attains salvation.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He who moves in the world keeping his mind, senses and the body under control, and without being influenced by feelings of attraction and repulsion, obtains Bliss. Men of restraint alone are healthy, strong, virtuous, long-lived and fit for salvation.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. <span class="char-style-override-12">Service—</span>He who serves his elders, and all other beings, disinterestedly, and in the spirit of serving God, serves God Himself at every step, and, finally, attains God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-12">Spiritual Practices—</span>Practices of Bhajana, Meditation, etc., done for God-realization are all spiritual practices or <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span>. One should adopt, for the realization of God, a course of discipline or <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span> for regular practice, suited to his qualifications, faith, nature as well as taste.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. <span class="char-style-override-12">Association with saints</span><span class="char-style-override-12">—</span><span class="char-style-override-10">The Bhāgavata </span>says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">दुर्लभो मानुषो देहो देहिनां क्षणभङ्गुर:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्रापि दुर्लभं मन्ये गोविन्दप्रियदशर्नम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XI. ii. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The human body is attained with difficulty by Jīvas, and is transient; and in that life, too, it is rarer to meet a devotee dear to God; for devotees and saints are, in a sense, the same as God Himself.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Goswāmī Tulasīdāsajī speaks of the devotee as even greater than God—<span class="char-style-override-14">‘राम तें अधिक राम कर दासा’</span>. Association with saints leads to the destruction of sins and purification of the heart. It helps one in fixing the mind on God and, uprooting doubts, leads to God-realization. Therefore the company of saints should be cultivated without fail.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Addressing king Rahūgaṇa, Mahātmā Bharata says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">रहूगणैतत्तपसा न याति</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चेज्यया निर्वपणाद् गृहाद्वा।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> V. xii. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O king, the Supreme Knowledge can be attained only by bathing the body with the dust of the feet of saints. It cannot be attained through penance, sacrifices, charity, benevolent acts done while in the family, study of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> or worship of the Gods of water, fire and the sun.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, service of saints and their association is an infallible means to salvation.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-8" xml:lang="en-US">THE THREE WAYS</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the four methods detailed above cannot be practised then the following three methods may be adopted—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Practice of truth in speech, subordination of self, looking upon women in general (except one’s wife) as a mother. If it is doubted that these will bring realization of Hari, Tulasīdāsa stands surety for it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-12">Truth in speech—</span>It is said—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">	“There is no austerity equal to Truthfulness, and no  </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">sin equal to falsehood;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">	He whose heart is the abode of Truth, has God</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Himself there.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Truth is synonymous with God. Where there is Truth, there is God. Because of his being a votary of Truth, the name of śrī Hariścandra has been remembered even to this day. When a man observes truth in speech, whatever escapes his lips turns out to be True. Falsehood should never be uttered out of a selfish motive, or as a matter of habit or in joke, or in the form of a promise about future action or conduct.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. <span class="char-style-override-12">Subordination of self—</span>It means making oneself subordinate to the will of God, i.e., to become a true servant of God, giving up the spirit of independence, and maintaining life for carrying out the Lord’s behests and following His promptings. Performance of duties in the world, e.g., service of the parents by the son, of the preceptor by the disciple, of the husband by the wife, of the master by the servant, and looking upon the object of service as God, also constitute subordination of self to God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the self becoming subordinate to God, it develops almost all the qualities of God. With the strength derived from God, it finds itself possessed of an immense accession of strength. Just as on the strength of the king an ordinary constable challenges and arrests men of wealth and position in society, even so subordinating himself to God man can attain victory over all sins on the strength of God and can be a great lover of God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-12">Looking upon all women (except one’s wife) as a mother</span>—Realizing that every woman is a part of the Divine Mother, one should mentally bow in reverence to every woman except his wife and show respect to all. This practice is extremely beneficial. He who cultivates this sentiment towards women in general will have an accession of energy and merit and being saved from sins may realize God.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is said that Goswāmī Tulasīdāsajī is the author of this couplet, and he stands surety for the fact that one adopting these three ways for practice is sure to cross the sea of existence.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-9" xml:lang="en-US">THE TWO WAYS</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the above-mentioned three ways cannot be practised, one should take to the following two ways—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Never forget two things, if you are anxious for salvation; One is Death, the other is God, says Nārāyaṇa.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-12">Remembrance of Death</span>—Everything in this world is perishable; whatever has an origin is bound to have an end. This body and its relations, and all other objects, will one day be devoured by death. Then, why this attachment for them? Why so much decoration for the body, which is steadily advancing towards death every moment? Man does not develop dispassion for things of the world, because he remains forgetful of death. King Yudhiṣṭhira, in answer to the query of the Yakṣa said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहन्यहनि भूतानि गच्छन्तीह यमालयम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">शेषा: स्थिरत्वमिच्छन्ति किमाश्चर्यमत: परम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata, Vanaparva</span> 3.3-316)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Everyday men go to the abode of death, yet those who are left behind seek to live eternally. What can be more surprising than this?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is why ‘Nārāyaṇa Swāmī’ advises us to remember death—for remembrance of death will save us from the commission of new sins, and generate dispassion for things of the world.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. <span class="char-style-override-12">Remembrance of  God</span>—With the cultivation of dispassion, ‘practice’ also is necessary. The Lord prescribed in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> both dispassion and practice the means to attain mind control. Constant remembrance of death will no doubt generate dispassion, but it will fail to bring joy to the heart. The world will appear blank and perishable. That is why it should be accompanied by the thought of God. The whole world is permeated by God; and whatever happens is but the sport of the Lord. He is supreme Bliss, supreme Consciousness and the very embodiment of Knowledge. Practice of constant remembrance of Him destroys sins, and the mind being transformed into the likeness of God, Mokṣa or salvation is easily attained.</p>
<p class="Sub-Heading" id="toc_marker-18-10" xml:lang="en-US">THE ONE AND ONLY WAY</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If the two ways described above cannot be adopted, then all must take to the one great way revealed by Bhagavan śrī Kr̥ṣṇa through His sacred lips, Which is the very essence of all the ways. The character of this one way is such that when properly practised, it automatically brings success to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>. It is as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वधर्मान् परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अहं त्वा सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच:॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Surrendering all duties to Me, seek refuge in Me alone, O Arjuna; I shall absolve you of all sins, grieve not.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Bhagavān śrī Rāma says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो ददाम्येतद् व्रतं मम॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa</span> VI. xviii. 83)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who even once surrendering himself to Me says, Lord, I am Thine’, I remove his fears from all beings, this is My solemn vow.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">Thus, surrender to the Lord in every respect is the best and supreme way. One who has surrendered himself to God has become God’s own and is free from fear and anxiety for all time. Therefore, giving up dependence on others’ support, one should surrender oneself to God, who is man’s best and sole lover and ever devoted to the promotion of his good.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-19">The Various Ways of God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">According to the ancient and modern systems of Vedantic thought dirt <span class="char-style-override-15">(मल)</span>, distraction <span class="char-style-override-15">(विक्षेप)</span>, and obstruction <span class="char-style-override-15">(आवरण)</span>—these three are the inherent defects. Among them, the means of destruction of dirt has been declared to be the adoption of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span>, that is, performance of actions like sacrifice, charity, askesis, service, adoration etc., in a disinterested spirit. Such actions lead to purification of the heart through the removal or destruction of mental ‘dirt’. Some friends assert Japa of the Divine Name alone as the principal means of immediate attainment of purification of the heart. Both these views are correct. After purification of the heart, meditation on God for the removal of the defect of ‘distraction’, and association of saints and study of elevating scriptures for the removal of ‘obstruction’ have been declared as the primary ways. This proves that it is man’s spiritual duty to realize Truth, first through the practice of disinterested action, then through the practice of worship, and then through the association of saints.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> According to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedānta</span>, man should adopt the fourfold practice in order to acquire the eligibility for liberation.

<p class="TEXT-English">This view is held by both the ancient and modern teachers of religion, and it is quite excellent in its own way, but this should not lead one to the conclusion that it is the last word on the subject, in other words, it is the only way, and there is no other.

<p class="TEXT-English">“Knowledge is better than practice (carried on without proper insight), meditation is superior to Knowledge, and renunciation of the fruit of actions is even superior to meditation; for peace immediately follows from renunciation.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Apart from this, just as <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span> has been declared to be an independent means of God-realization, even so <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> has been pronounced to be an independent means. The Lord says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“It is the ignorant, not the wise, who say that <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> are productive of divergent results.

The supreme state, which is reached by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span>, is attained also by the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span>. Therefore, he, who sees <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayoga </span>and <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> as one, so far as their result goes, really sees.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Through the continued practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga </span>in a disinterested spirit, the heart becomes pure, and thereby automatically true Knowledge of God dawns on the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhaka</span>, and it is not necessary for him to take to any other practice for this Knowledge.

<p class="TEXT-English">When the supreme state is attainable only through the practice of action in a disinterested spirit, what, then, is there to wonder, if the devotee of God, through God’s grace, should attain the same !

<p class="TEXT-English">Many such verses are to be found in the scriptures, but they are not being quoted here because it is not intended to lengthen the article.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In short, disinterested action and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> of devotion, both are independent paths of discipline, and firstly, <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span>, then Adoration and, lastly Knowledge—this is also an order of procedure. And these three disciplines are each capable of leading to God-realization, when practised separately and independently. The Lord has made this point clear in verse 24 of Chapter XIII of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानेनात्मनि पश्यन्ति केचिदात्मानमात्मना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्ये सांख्येन योगेन कर्मयोगेन चापरे॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Some by meditation behold the Self (<span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span>) in their own heart with the help of their pure reason; others by proceeding along the path of Knowledge and others, again, by treading the path of Action.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">Besides these, in Chapter IV, verses 24 to 29 of the Gītā, in the name of the different forms of sacrifice, the Lord has laid down many other means of God-realization. In his <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga-darśana</span>, Maharṣi PataÛjali also has described various practices which lead to God-realization. Out of these, man should select a discipline for himself and earnestly take to its practice. The fruit of all disciplines is attainment of ‘true Knowledge’ of God, and the fruit of this ‘true Knowledge’ is God-realization.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-20">Need of Dispassion and Devotion for God-realization</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For the sake of God-realization every striver needs must get rid of attachment. Love for gold, woman, honour, fame, prestige, progeny, riches, dainties, smartness, luxury, comfort and all other worldly enjoyments induces evil propensities like lust and anger, greed and infatuation, jealousy and hatred; vices such as lying, deceit, thieving, gambling, violence, adultery, eating prohibited food, drinking and so on; evil habits such as visiting picture-dromes and indecent plays and shows, playing at dice and cards, use of intoxicating drugs, smoking, idling etc., as well as suffering of every description—bodily distemper and mental anguish, those brought about by divine agency and those caused by other living beings; in short, it is the root of all evils. Hence love or attachment for objects of senses must be totally given up. In other words, one should conceive an intense aversion for all these objects. So long as a strong disinclination for the enjoyments of the world and one’s body does not appear, a striver cannot achieve success in any spiritual endeavour; for in all spiritual endeavour; dispassion is most essential. No spiritual endeavour can bear fruit without dispassion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In his <span class="char-style-override-10">Aphorisms on Yoga</span> the great sage PataÛjali, has recommended only two sovereign recipes for setting at rest the functioning of the mind—repeated practice and dispassion—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्यां तन्निरोध:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (1.12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Complete cessation of the functioning of the mind is brought about only through <span class="char-style-override-10">Abhyāsa </span>(continued practice) and dispassion.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्र स्थितौ यत्नोऽभ्यास:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (I. 13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Of the two, <span class="char-style-override-10">Abhyāsa</span> consists in endeavouring to steady the mind.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">स तु दीर्घकालनैरन्तर्यसत्कारासेवितो दृढभूमि:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (I. 14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“That (<span class="char-style-override-10">Abhyāsa</span>), however, gets firmly rooted (only) when duly carried on for a long time uninterruptedly with reverence.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the sage proceeds to define <span class="char-style-override-10">Vairāgya </span>(dispassion) as follows—</p>
<p class="Shlok">दृष्टानुश्रविकविषयवितृष्णस्य वशीकारसंज्ञा वैराग्यम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (I. 15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The state known by the name of <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaśīkāra </span>(subjugation) of a mind which is free from covetousness with regard to (all) objects of senses—whether (actually) perceived or known through the Vedas—is called <span class="char-style-override-10">Vairāgya</span> (dispassion).</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत् परं पुरुषख्यातेर्गुणवैतृष्ण्यम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (I. 16)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Total absence of covetousness with regard to the modes of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span>, following from the realization of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Puruṣa</span> (Spirit), is known as Para <span class="char-style-override-10">Vairāgya</span> (supreme dispassion).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus it is proved that without dispassion the functioning of the mind does not cease and that there is no Self-realization so long as the functioning of the mind does not cease. As a matter of fact, Self-realization comes only when the mind has been fully subdued.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The sage PataÛjali says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोध:।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(I. 2)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“<span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> is complete cessation of the functioning of the mind.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">तदा द्रष्टु: स्वरूपेऽवस्थानम्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (I. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Then the subject (the perceiver) is established in his own reality.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Even the realization, according to the principles of <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedānta</span> philosophy or the doctrine of Monism that there is only one entity (<span class="char-style-override-10">viz.</span>, the Absolute), is not possible without dispassion. It is most essential for a follower of the doctrine of Monism to be equipped with the four requisites <span class="char-style-override-15">(साधनचतुष्टय)</span>, of which the first two, <span class="char-style-override-10">viz</span>., <span class="char-style-override-10">Viveka</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Vairāgya </span>are the foremost. The four requisites are—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(1) <span class="char-style-override-12">Viveka</span>—True knowledge distinguishing the real from the unreal and the everlasting from the transient.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(2) <span class="char-style-override-12">Vairāgya</span>—Total absence of attachment for the body and all mundane objects.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(3) <span class="char-style-override-12">The sixfold endowment </span><span class="char-style-override-15">(षट्सम्पत्ति)</span>—Consisting of 1. <span class="char-style-override-10">śama</span>, 2. <span class="char-style-override-10">Dama</span>, 3. <span class="char-style-override-10">Uparati</span>, 4. <span class="char-style-override-10">Titikṣā</span>, 5. <span class="char-style-override-10">śraddhā</span> and 6. <span class="char-style-override-10">Samādhāna</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">1. <span class="char-style-override-10">śama</span>—through tameness, steadiness and quietude of the mind.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">2. <span class="char-style-override-10">Dama</span>—through tameness and abstinency of the senses.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">3. <span class="char-style-override-10">Uparati</span>—complete cessation of fidgetiness or distraction of the mind in the shape of thoughts of various kinds.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">4. <span class="char-style-override-10">Titikṣā</span>—enduring pairs of opposites such as heat and cold (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> II. 14).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">5. <span class="char-style-override-10">śraddhā</span>—reverent faith of the same type as we have for things seen by us in the Vedas and other sacred books, God and holy men as well as in the other world;</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">6. <span class="char-style-override-10">Samādhāna</span>—complete withdrawal of the mind and intellect from all worldly objects and their absorption into the object of adoration.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">(4) <span class="char-style-override-10">Mumukṣutva</span>—a keen desire to the exclusion of every other desire to redeem one’s soul.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">None of these requisites can be had without <span class="char-style-override-10">Viveka</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Vairāgya</span> and without these requisites it is not possible to carry on the practice of hearing discourses on, cogitating and contemplating on <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> (the Absolute)—which is truth, consciousness and bliss combined—much less to attain God-realization in the shape of direct knowledge of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. Hence <span class="char-style-override-10">Vairāgya</span> is most essential even for the cultivation of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span> (spiritual enlightenment). The Lord too says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बाह्यस्पर्शेष्वसक्तात्मा विन्दत्यात्मनि यत् सुखम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा सुखमक्षयमश्नुते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (V. 21)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He whose mind remains unattached to sense-objects derives through meditation the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika </span>joy which dwells in the mind; then, having completely identified himself through meditation with Brahma, that <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span> enjoys eternal bliss.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For,</p>
<p class="Shlok">ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दु:खयोनय एव ते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">आद्यन्तवन्त: कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुध:॥<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (V. 22)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The pleasures which are born of sense-contacts are, really speaking, a source of misery alone (though appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people). They have a begin-ning and an end (they come and go). Arjuna, it is for this reason that a wise man does not indulge in them.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How these sensuous enjoyments are a source of agony is pointed out by the sage PataÛjali in the following aphorism—</p>
<p class="Shlok">परिणामतापसंस्कारदु:खैर्गुणवृत्तिविरोधाच्च दु:खमेव सर्वं विवेकिन:। <span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(II.15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Because every enjoyment (in this world) not only ends in agony but is attended with agony and because its impression on the mind (of the enjoyer) too is painful (both here and hereafter) and because the functions of the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas </span>conflict with one another (even at the time of enjoyment), all enjoyment is affliction in the eye of the discriminating.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It is therefore that, while discussing the factors helpful to the attainment of spiritual enlightenment, the Lord dwells on aversion to the pleasures of sense in the following verses—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहंकार एव च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">असक्तिरनभिष्वङ्ग: पुत्रदारगृहादिषु।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नित्यं च समचित्तत्वमिष्टानिष्टोपपत्तिषु॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Aversion towards the objects of enjoyment of this world and the next and also absence of egotism; pondering again and again on the pain and evils inherent in birth, old age and disease; absence of attachment and the feeling of mineness with respect to son, wife, home etc., and constant equipoise of mind both in favourable and unfavourable circumstances.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Further, while discussing the topic of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga </span>in Discourse XVIII, the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बुद्‍ध्या विशुद्धया युक्तो धृत्यात्मानं नियम्य च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">शब्दादीन्विषयांस्त्यक्त्वा रागद्वेषौ व्युदस्य च॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">विविक्तसेवी लघ्वाशी यतवाक्कायमानस:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानयोगपरो नित्यं वैराग्यं समुपाश्रित:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XVIII. 51-52)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Endowed with an untarnished intellect and partaking of a light, <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> and regulated diet, living in a lonely and undefiled place, having rejected sound and other objects of sense and controlled in his mind, speech and body by restraining the mind and senses through firmness of a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type, and taking a resolute stand on dispassion, a man ever devoted to the Yoga of meditation (becomes qualified for oneness with Brahma).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> The practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> too cannot proceed without dispassion. It is only by shaking off attachment that one gets firmly established in <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span> (the path of disinterested action). The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तस्मादसक्त: सततं कार्यं कर्म समाचर।</p>
<p class="Shlok">असक्तो ह्याचरन् कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुष:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (III. 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Therefore, go on doing your duty well without attachment. Doing work without attachment, man reaches the Supreme.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That is why—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कायेन मनसा बुद्‍ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">योगिन: कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वाऽऽत्मशुद्धये॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> V. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“<span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogīs</span> perform action with their senses, mind, intellect and body as well, giving up the feeling of mineness with respect to them and shaking off attachment, simply for the sake of self-purification.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदा हि नेन्द्रियार्थेषु न कर्मस्वनुषज्जते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वसंकल्पसंन्यासी योगारूढस्तदोच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.,</span> VI. 4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“When a man ceases to have any attachment either for the objects of senses or for actions, and has renounced all thought of the world, he is said to have climbed to the heights of <span class="char-style-override-10">Yoga</span>.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As for the Yoga of devotion one gets established in it only through deep-rooted disinclination for the enjoyments of the world and exclusive love for the Lord. Hence he who treads the path of devotion should develop deep-rooted disinclination for the enjoyments of the world and exclusive love for the Lord. If a man cherishes love for anything other than the Lord, his devotion is divided. It is through undivided devotion that the Lord is directly perceived; nay, His reality too can be truly known through such devotion. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या त्वनन्यया शक्य अहमेवंविधोऽर्जुन।</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Through single-minded devotion, however, I can be seen in this form (with four arms), nay, known in essence and even entered into (attained in terms of identity), O valiant one !”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Exclusive devotion is only another name for undivided love—love which is absolutely disinterested and imbued with supreme reverence and which is characterized by the notion that the Almighty Lord alone is supreme, that He alone is our master, worth approaching for protection, nay, our highest goal and supreme refuge, our father and mother, brother and relation, greatest benefactor, our only possession, that we have none else to call our own. In other words, that love which is entirely free from the blemish of self-interest, pride and aberration, which is always and in every way integral and unflinching, which is absolutely undivided and which makes it unbearable for the love to forget the Lord even for an instant, goes by the name of exclusive devotion.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In his <span class="char-style-override-10">Aphorisms on Bhakti</span> the sage Nārada says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नारदस्तु तदर्पिताखिलाचारता तद्विस्मरणे परमव्याकुलतेति।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (<span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti-Sūtras</span>, 19)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“According to Nārada, however, <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti </span>(devotion) consists in offering all activities to God and feeling supremely restless at the slightest interruption in the thought of God.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, developing a strong disinclination towards the enjoyments of the world and one’s body, and cultivating exclusive love for the Lord, one must take refuge in Him in every way. Figuratively referring to the world as a tree, the Lord too stresses in the following verses the advisability of cultivating dispassion and taking refuge in Him;—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न रूपमस्येह तथोपलभ्यते</p>
<p class="Shlok">नान्तो न चादिर्नं च सम्प्रतिष्ठा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अश्वत्थमेनं सुविरूढमूल-</p>
<p class="Shlok">मसङ्गशस्त्रेण दृढेन छित्त्वा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत: पदं तत्  परिमार्गितव्यं</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्मिन् गता न निवर्तन्ति भूय:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">तमेव चाद्यं पुरुषं प्रपद्ये</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत: प्रवृत्ति: प्रसृता पुराणी॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XV. 3-4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The nature of this cosmic tree does not on mature thought turn out what it is represented to be; for it has neither beginning nor end nor (even) stability. Therefore, cutting down this Peepul tree, which is most firmly rooted, with the strong axe of dispassion, a man should then diligently make an enquiry about that supreme state, <span class="char-style-override-10">viz</span>., God, attaining to which they return no more to this world; and having concluded that he stands dedicated to that primeval Being (God Nārāyaṇa) Himself, from whom the flow of this beginningless creation has progressed, he should meditate on Him.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord now announces the reward of this Sādhana in the following verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्मानमोहा जितसङ्गदोषा</p>
<p class="Shlok">अध्यात्मनित्या विनिवृत्तकामा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">द्वन्द्वैर्विमुक्ता: सुखदु:खसंज्ञै-</p>
<p class="Shlok">र्गच्छन्त्यमूढा: पदमव्ययं तत्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (XV. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Those wise men who are free from pride and infatuation, who have conquered the evil of attachment, who are in eternal union with God, whose cravings have altogether ceased and who are entirely free from all pairs of opposites going by the name of pleasure and pain, attain to that immortal state.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence one should do well to conceive some relationship with the Lord and develop love for Him. The feeling that ‘the Lord is my master and I His servant’ is known by the name of <span class="char-style-override-10">Dāsya-bhāva</span>; the feeling of Bharata and Hanumān towards śrī Rāma was of this type. The feeling that ‘the Lord is my greatest friend’ goes by the name of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sakhya-bhāva</span>; this type of feeling characterized the Devotion of Arjuna towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. The feeling that ‘the Lord is my beloved son’ is designated as <span class="char-style-override-10">Vātsalya-bhāva</span>; such was the feeling of mother Yaśodā towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa. The feeling that ‘the Lord is my own husband’ is known as Swakīya Mādhurya-bhāva or Kanta-bhāva; the feeling of Rukmiṇī towards śrī Kr̥ṣṇa was of this type. And the feeling that ‘Lord is my darling and friend’ is known as the <span class="char-style-override-10">Parakīya Mādhurya-bhāva</span>, a most sublime and innocent feeling that characterized the devotion of śrī Rādhā andthe other cowherdesses of Vraja. Inspired by any of these feelings, one should enter into a relationship with the Lord. When some sort of relation marked with supreme reverence and devotion is established with the Lord, one gradually comes to develop exclusive love for the Lord. It is no longer possible for such a lover of the Lord to be disunited from Him; for a man is sure to develop constant and abiding love for an object that he truly regards as his own and such an object never escapes from his heart. Nay, his mind automatically ceases to have any attachment for everything other than that. Loving remembrance of the Lord is ever present in the mind of such a lover, as a result of which he is speedily enabled to realize Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hence we should cultivate undivided love for the Lord in the aforesaid manner and, observing the strict vow of a Cātaka bird and cherishing exclusive devotion to Him, get impatient for His sight. Though dying of thirst, a Cātaka would never stoop to touch water fallen on the ground, but would turn to the cloud and utter its shrill notes of ‘Pihu!’ ‘Pihu!!’. It would begin to warble even at the sight of a waterless cloud and would centre its hopes in the cloud alone. Even if the latter rained hailstones, smashing its wings thereby, it would continue to direct its eyes towards the cloud and pine for rain-drops. Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">उपल बरषि गरजत तरजि डारत कुलिस कठोर।</p>
<p class="Shlok">चितव कि चातक मेघ तजि कबहुँ दूसरी ओर॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Even if the cloud rains hailstones and thunders in a menacing way with a terrible flash of lightning, will the Cātaka ever turn its eyes towards anyone other than the cloud?”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore,</p>
<p class="Shlok">जौं घन बरसै समय सिर जौं भरि जनम उदास।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तुलसी या चित चातकहि तऊ तिहारी आस॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“O cloud in the guise of śrī Rāma, whether You rain (shower Your grace) at the appropriate time or remain indifferent throughout my life, the Cātaka of my mind, says Tulasīdāsa, will (ever) have its hopes centred in You.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the same way we too should long for the Lord’s sight and rivet our hopes on Him, awaiting His grace every moment. Whatever trials and tribulations we may have to face, undaunted like the Cātaka bird, which keeps yearning for rain drops alone, let us crave for the sight of the Lord and for nothing else.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To cite another illustration, just as a fish gets uneasy without water and finds itself in throes of death if it fails to get water even for a short while, we should experience a similar state of uneasiness due to separation from the Lord. The longing for a sight of the Lord grows very intense in the agony of separation and such intense longing is attended with a joyful experience of a unique kind, the like of which is never had in union.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a striver gets impatient for a sight of the Lord, the latter feels compelled to appear before his eyes immediately, even as He reached the home of Rukmiṇī and took her to Dwārakā when the latter wept in agony caused by separation from Him. When a man grows altogether impatient in his agony of separation from the Lord, and finds himself on the verge of death, the Lord can no long tarry even for a moment. When the cowherdesses of Vraja wailed in their agony of separation from the Lord and were about to die, Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa appeared in their midst and enacted the great <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāsa </span>dance with them.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We should experience the same sort of agony for the Lord as Bharata did due to his separation from Lord śrī Rāma. Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa portrays his agony and lament in the following words—</p>
<p class="Shlok">रहेउ एक दिन अवधि अधारा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">समुझत मन दुख भयउ अपारा॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">कारन कवन नाथ नहिं आयउ।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">      (<span class="char-style-override-10">śrī Rāmacaritamānasa, UttaraKāṇḍa</span>)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The term of śrī Rāma’s exile, which was the sole hope of his life, was going to expire only a day hence the thought filled Bharata’s mind with untold grief. How is it that the Lord did not turn up? Has He cast me out of His mind, knowing me to be crooked? Ah! how blessed and fortunate is Lakṣmaṇa, who is truly devoted to śrī Rāma’s lotus-feet. The Lord knew me to be false and perverse; that is why He refused to take me along with Him. If the Lord were to consider my doings, there would be no redemption for me even after countless cycles. But the Lord never takes into account the faults of His devotees, being a friend of the humble and most tender-hearted. I have a firm conviction in my heart that śrī Rāma will surely meet me; for the omens are so propitious. But, if I outlive the expiry of the time-limit, no one would be so despicable in this world as I. “While Bharata’s mind was thus sinking in the ocean of separation from śrī Rāma, the son of the wind-god, disguised as a Brāhmaṇa, came like a bark to his rescue. He found Bharata seated on a mat of <span class="char-style-override-10">Kuśa</span> grass, emaciated in body, with a coil of matted hair for a crown and the words ‘Rāma, Rāma, Raghupati’ on his lips, his lotus-eyes streaming with tears.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">What a sublime picture of dispassion and undivided love! When the Lord contemplated this state of mind of Bharata, he first despatched Hanumān and then went personally to him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thus overwhelmed with the agony of separation from the Lord, the striver should invoke His presence by uttering His most sacred names—and, mentally perceiving Him, should meditate on that mental image of the Lord. Thus enjoying His sight and touch with his mind and conversing with Him, he should get immersed in love for the Lord like the sage Sutīkṣṇa of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Rāmacaritamānasa</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English"> Sutīkṣṇa was so overwhelmed with love for śrī Rāma that he ceased to have an idea of the four quarters or of the intermediate points of the compass. Witnessing this love-lorn state of Sutīkṣṇa, the Lord revealed Himself in his heart. The sage now sat down motionless on the road, his body bristling all over like a jack-fruit with its hair standing on end. Lord śrī Rāma thereupon drew near and was enraptured to see his ecstatic mood. The Lord tried His best to rouse the sage from his trance; but the latter would not wake. The Lord then withdrew His image from his heart. Overwhelmed with agony, the sage now opened his eyes and found the Lord before his eyes enraptured through love, the sage fell at His feet. The Lord lifted him up with His arms and pressed him to His bosom. Sutīkṣṇa fixed his gaze exclusively on the Lord, extolled Him and conducting Him to his hermitage, offered Him homage in ways more than one.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way when the striver gets absorbed in meditation on the Lord, He sometimes appears in person and reveals Himself before his very eyes. Following the noble example of the loving devotee Sutīkṣṇa, therefore, we should get absorbed in meditation on the Lord.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Then the striver should picture to his mind that the Lord has appeared in the sky and is incessantly shedding on him rays of His forgiveness, compassion, tranquillity, contentment, wisdom, dispassion, even-mindedness, love, joy and other divine virtues; that the nectarean rays of light emanating from those divine virtues of the Lord are saturating every atom of his mind, senses and body with divine joy and pervading the entire space in such a way that those transcendent virtues are permeating every pore of his being and infusing in him liveliness, animation, joy and tranquillity that know no bounds; and that the striver is feeling enraptured again and again to behold that divine personality of the Lord and is gazing on it with unwinking eyes. He should then picture to himself that the Lord has descended on the earth and set His feet on the ground; that, enraptured at His sight, the striver is falling prostrate at His feet and that the Lord is lifting him up and clasping him to His bosom in the same way as Lord śrī Rāma hugged the sage Sutīkṣṇa and later on His own young brother, Bharata. The striver should also feel that the aforesaid sight, touch, speech and talk, nay, the very thought of the Lord is supremely delightful, infinitely enjoyable, sweet as nectar, surcharged with love and full of joy.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">While mentally touching the Lord’s person with his hands, the striver should feel as if the hair all over his body are standing on end a thrill of joy is running through his body. And while pressing Him to his bosom he should feel as if an electric current of joy is passing through his entire frame. While gazing on Him the striver should feel as if his eyes are drinking divine nectar. He should conceive the face and eyes of the Lord as blooming like a full-blown lotus. Just as a bee flies from one flower to another and thence to a third, his eyes now rest on the Lord’s mouth and now on His cheeks; while at another moment they meet the Lord’s eyes and enjoy nectarean bliss. Just as the Cakora bird remains constantly gazing on the full moon so long as it is visible in the sky, the striver should continue to scan with his mind’s eye the eyes and cheeks, nay, the entire face of the Lord and feel transported with joy while enjoying their blissful sight. The Lord’s speech should likewise be conceived as extremely soft, most charming, exceedingly sweet, nay, full of nectar, delightful and most agreeable to the ear. An ethereal fragrance should be conceived as emanating from His body—a fragrance which is full of nectar and enjoyable to the nose. Similarly His touch should be conceived as full of nectar and sweetness to one’s bosom and hands. Even as the cowherdesses of Vraja revelled in the Lord through their sight, speech, touch, dance and music and were drowned in an ocean of joy even while contemplating on the Lord with their mind and comprehending His greatness with their reason, so the striver too should revel in Him with his mind, intellect, senses and body and enjoy His transcendent sweetness. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> too the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">मच्चित्ता मद्गतप्राणा बोधयन्त: परस्परम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कथयन्तश्च मां नित्यं तुष्यन्ति च रमन्ति च॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (X. 9)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“With their mind fixed on Me and their lives surrendered to Me, (nay). enlightening one another about My greatness and speaking of Me, My devotees ever remain gratified and revel in Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">To fix one’s mind on the Lord and to commune with Him with one’s mind, body and senses—this is what is meant by revelling in Him; and to enjoy the transcendent bliss arising out of such loving communion—this is what is meant by being gratified. Just as water is the mainstay of life to a fish, the Lord is the prop of life to a devotee. And just as the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gopīs</span> of Vraja talked with one another about the true character and secret of Lord śrī Kr̥ṣṇa and thereby apprised one another of His truth and mysteries, so should the striver feel as if he is realizing the truth and secret of His divine character by talking with the Lord Himself and also as if he is speaking to the Lord about His virtues, glory and essential character.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a striver gets absorbed in this way in meditation on the Lord and mentally communes with Him, the hair on his body stand on end, tears begin to flow from his eyes, his throat gets choked and speech fails him and his heart expands with joy. The sage Nārada says—</p>
<p class="Gadya">भक्ता एकान्तिनो मुख्या:। कण्ठावरोधरोमाञ्चाश्रुभि: परस्परं लपमाना: पावयन्ति कुलानि पृथिवीं च।<span class="char-style-override-4"></span></p>
<p class="TXT-Right">     (Aphorisms on Devotion 67-68)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Devotees who are exclusively attached to the Lord are the best. Devotees of this type, conversing with each other in a voice choked with emotion, the hairs on their body standing on end and eyes wet with tears, sanctify not only their race but the whole earth.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord Himself says in <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">वाग् गद्गदा द्रवते यस्य चित्तं</p>
<p class="Shlok">रुदत्यभीक्ष्णं हसति क्वचिच्च।</p>
<p class="Shlok">विलज्ज उद्गायति नृत्यते च </p>
<p class="Shlok">मद्भक्तियुक्तो भुवनं पुनाति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (XI. xiv. 24)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The person rich in devotion to Me, whose speech fails him and heart melts, who repeatedly weeps and sometimes laughs and sings loudly and dances without shyness, purifies the (whole) world.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Describing the devotion of such a devotee, who is overwhelmed with love, the saint Sundaradāsa says in his <span class="char-style-override-10">Sundaravilāsa</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">न लाज तीन लोक की, न वेद को कह्यौ करै।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न संक भूत प्रेत की न देव जच्छ तें डरै॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुनै न कान और की द्रसै न और इच्छना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कहै न मुख और बात, भक्ति प्रेम लच्छना॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“When a devotee gets absorbed in loving devotion, he feels shy before none in all the three worlds. In other words, he loses all sense of bashfulness. He is no longer capable of respecting the commandments of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vedas</span> and other scriptures; for, being full of love, he ceases to have any consciousness of the outside world. He entertains no fear of ghosts and other evil spirits nor does he feel afraid of gods or demigods. He hears no other talk than that of God-love and sees none else than his beloved Lord nor does he crave for anything else. He utters with his tongue nothing else than the praises of the Lord. This is what goes by the name of loving devotion to the Lord.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">By thus offering loving adoration to the Lord in the form of revelling in His company the striver comes to attain true knowledge of God and is enabled, through such knowledge vouchsafed by the Lord Himself, to perceive Him directly. At the moment of such perception he gazes on the Lord with unwinking eyes; his ego-sense vanishes, or in other words he forgets his very self and like one spell-bound remains conscious of the Lord’s personality alone. At the time of one’s meeting with the Lord all sense of modesty and diffidence, self-esteem, fear, honour and respect leaves him. The striver rises above such feelings. Here the lover, the beloved Lord and the love subsisting between them are all one from the point of view of their spiritual substance, although they have a separate existence of their own. From the point of view of the Lord, He Himself is the lover, the devotee being His beloved; whereas, from the point of view of the devotee, he is the lover, the Lord being the beloved; and their relation with one another goes by the name of love. It seems as if love alone manifests itself in the dual form of the Lord and His devotee and exhibits its sport. Every effort of the Lord is intended to enrapture the devotee and vice versa. Their love as depicted above is ever on the increase and is never dormant. Both stand on an equal footing; nay, there is absolute identity between them. There is no feeling of honour or respect for each other. Honour and respect, self-esteem and fear, modesty and diffidence characterize the relation of master and servant. Although bashfulness and diffidence are absent in the relation of husband and wife, honour and respect, pride and fear continue even there. The relation of parent and son is also marked by honour and respect, fear, bashfulness and diffidence. Although honour and respect and fear too are absent in the attitude of friendliness, diffidence is present even there. In the domain of love, however, absolute identity and equality reign supreme. Hence there is no tinge of modesty and diffidence, pride and fear, honour and respect in this relation inasmuch as they constitute a stigma on pure, unalloyed love. The nature of such transcendent love cannot be depicted in words. The sage Nārada says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Attaining this Love, the loving devotee sees nothing but Love, hears only about Love, speaks only of Love and thinks of Love alone.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A devotee endowed with such unalloyed and undivided love is rid of infatuation once for all. Such a devotee comes to realize by His grace in due course, the essential character of the Lord—whatever it is and whatever it is like, whether with or without form, <span class="char-style-override-17">s</span>aguṇa or Nirguṇa. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-21">Means of Attaining Supreme Peace</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Generally speaking, all men long to attain peace, but they search for it in the pleasures of sense alone, peace does not, however, lie in the pleasures of sense. On the other hand, they are brimful with disquietude alone. When peace does not at all exist in the pleasures of sense, how can it be found when sought for in them? Just as coolness is impossible to get in fire, peace is impossible to get in the pleasures of sense. Through ignorance many men imagine peace to lie in the advancement of worldly happiness, affluence and power. Peace, however, does not lie in worldly happiness. The momentary peace that appears in it is a mere reflection of an iota of it. A semblance of peace alone appears in it through misconception; in reality there is no peace in it. Had there been real peace in it, it would abide; for that alone which is real abides—such is the positive conclusion of exalted souls. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभि:॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“The unreal has no existence and the real never ceases to be; the reality of both has thus been perceived by the seers of truth.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore the peace which appears to lie in worldly enjoyments is only apparent, illusory and not real, just as joy has been classified under various heads—the delight coming from sleep, languor and obstinate error is <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span> ( <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XVIII. 39); that proceeding from the contact of the senses with their objects is <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.</span> XVIII. 38), while the cheerfulness following from the placidity of mind in <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.</span> XVIII. 36-37), so in the same way peace should be classified under three heads. The tranquillity which appears to lie in sleep, languor and obstinate error is <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span>, that which appears in enjoyments proceeding from the contact of the senses with their objects is <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span>, while that which appears in the absence of distraction or restlessness of mind is <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Ibid.</span> XVI. 2).</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Though helpful in God-realization, even these <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> joy and peace prove to be a source of bondage (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XIV) and interfere with the spiritual discipline of the striver and retard its progress if the striver develops an attachment for them; for, being identified with the body and looking upon it as his own, the striver comes through ignorance to esteem himself as superior. Nay, self-esteem sometimes leads to the striver’s downfall. Hence a striver should never be proud of his or her virtues. Exalted souls who have realized God for their part never pride themselves on their excellences. Through ignorance a striver, however, in some cases comes to regard himself as superior. He should therefore always beware of this contingency and should give up the notion of superiority.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">God is most tranquil by nature. In the benedictory verse at the beginning of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sundarakāṇḍa</span> of śrī Rāmacaritamānasa Goswāmī Tulasīdāsa says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">शान्तं शाश्वतमप्रमेयमनघं निर्वाणशान्तिप्रदम्।</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I bow to śrī Rāma, who is placid, eternal, beyond the ordinary means of cognition and sinless, the bestower of supreme peace in the form of final beatitude.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">That supreme peace which is beyond the three <span class="char-style-override-10">Guṇas</span> or modes of <span class="char-style-override-10">Prakr̥ti</span> comes to him who has realized the supremely placid God. Lord śrī Rāma has declared ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">śānti</span>’ (placidity) to be the main characteristic of saints among other such characteristics—</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Having no interested motive of their own, they are devoted to My Name and are abodes of tranquillity, dispassion, humility and good humour.”<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span></p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">* बिगत काम मम नाम परायन।</p>
<p class="Footnotes-Bold para-style-override-5">सांति बिरति बिनती मुदितायन॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The tranquillity that reigns in the heart of the striver at the time of his spiritual endeavour is of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type and leads to supreme peace. That peace in the form of God-realization has been referred to in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> and other scriptures as <span class="char-style-override-10">śāśwatī śānti</span> (Everlasting Peace), <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramā śānti</span> (Supreme Peace), <span class="char-style-override-10">Naiṣṭhikī śānti</span> (Perpetual Peace), <span class="char-style-override-10">Amr̥ta</span> (immortality), <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> (the Eternal), <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramātmā</span> (the Supreme Spirit), <span class="char-style-override-10">Parama Pada </span>(the Supreme Goal), <span class="char-style-override-10">Parama Sthāna</span> (the Supreme State), <span class="char-style-override-10">Parama Dhāma</span> (the Supreme Abode of God). <span class="char-style-override-10">Paramā Gati</span> (the Supreme Destiny) etc. Several means for attaining the aforesaid Supreme Peace have been recommended in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> and other holy books. The following three, <span class="char-style-override-10">viz.</span>, <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> (the Path of Action), <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga </span>(the Discipline of Knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (the Path of Devotion) are the foremost among them. A passing reference is made to them in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This Supreme Peace is natural in God-realized souls while it is acquired by strivers through endeavour. This alone is the reward even of actions done in a disinterested spirit by strivers pursuing the Path of Action; for it is not actions but the disinterested spirit that counts in the Path of Action. And the mind of the striver pursuing the Path of Action gets purified when he develops a fully disinterested spirit. His reverence for the course of discipline followed by him then becomes stable and through true knowledge he attains Supreme Peace and Supreme Bliss. But peace cannot be attained without endeavour in a reverential spirit. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">न चाभावयत: शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुत: सुखम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (II. 66)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who has not controlled his mind and senses can have no determinate reason, nor can such an undisciplined man have belief (in God). The unbelieving man can have no peace, and how can there be happiness for one lacking peace of mind ?” For peace comes through disinterestedness—</p>
<p class="Shlok">युक्त: कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्नोति नैष्ठिकीम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अयुक्त: कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (V. 12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Offering the fruit of his actions to God, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> attains everlasting peace in the shape of God-realization; whereas he who works with a selfish motive, being attached to the fruit of actions through desire, gets tied down.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as in the foregoing paragraphs peace has been declared as attainable by reverently treading the Path of Action, it is likewise attained by reverently pursuing the Path of Knowledge too.</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्पर: संयतेन्द्रिय:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (IV. 39)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who has fully controlled his senses, is exclusively devoted to spiritual practice and is full of faith attains Knowledge; having gained Knowledge, he immediately attains Supreme Peace in the form of God-realization..”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Getting rid of one’s sins and developing an aversion for the enjoyments of the world through intense practice carried on in a reverential spirit, the striver acquires full control over his senses and mind. True knowledge of the reality of God also dawns on him, whereby he is able to attain Supreme Peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The ripeness of spiritual discipline attained by treading the Paths of Action and Knowledge has been spoken of in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> by the name of <span class="char-style-override-10">Niṣṭhā</span>. The highest goal in the shape of Supreme Peace and Supreme Joy is the reward.</p>
<p class="Shlok">लोकेऽस्मिन्द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानयोगेन सांख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (III. 3)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In this world two courses of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> (spiritual discipline) have been enunciated by Me in the past. In the case of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span> the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana </span>proceeds along the Path of Knowledge, whereas in the case of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span> it proceeds along the Path of Action.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He further says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत्सांख्यै:प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">एकं साख्यं च योगं च य: पश्यति स पश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (V. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The (highest) state which is reached by <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogīs</span> is attained also by <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogīs</span>. Therefore, he alone who sees <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> as one, so far as their reward is concerned, really sees.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord delineates the Path of Knowledge in verses 11 to 30 and the Path of Action in verses 40 to 53 of Discourse II. The Path of Devotion too is the same as the Path of Action.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the following verses the Lord declares eternal peace as attainable through the Path of Devotion as well—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते मामनन्यभाक्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">साधुरेव स मन्तव्य: सम्यग्व्यवसितो हि स:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्षिप्रं भवति धर्मात्मा शश्वच्छान्तिं निगच्छति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कौन्तेय प्रति जानीहि न मे भक्त: प्रणश्यति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (IX. 30-31)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Even if the vilest sinner worships Me with exclusive devotion, he should be accounted a saint, for he has rightly resolved; (he is positive in his belief that there is nothing like devoted worship of the Lord). Speedily he becomes virtuous and secures lasting peace. Know it for certain, O Arjuna, that My devotee never falls.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore it is most essential for a striver treading the Path of Devotion exclusively to worship and remember the Lord at all times without interruption with reverence and love.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For God-realization all the three Paths of Action, Devotion and Knowledge are equal. Diverse courses of discipline have been recommended only in view of diversity in fitness. A striver is qualified for that course of discipline alone for which he has reverence, faith, love and aptitude. The reward of all the three disciplines being the same, they are really identical. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, the Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानेनात्मनि पश्यन्ति केचिदात्मानमात्मना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्ये सांख्येन योगेन कर्मयोगेन चापरे॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XIII. 24)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Some by meditation behold the Supreme Spirit in the heart with the help of their refined and sharp intellect; others realize it through the discipline of knowledge, and others, again, through the discipline of action.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It has been pointed out at various places in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> that a striver attains supreme peace on developing disinterestedness in a full measure through the practice of Karmayoga. The Lord says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं</p>
<p class="Shlok">समुद्रमाप: प्रविशन्ति यद्वत्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्त सर्वे</p>
<p class="Shlok">स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (II. 70)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“As the waters of different rivers enter the ocean, which, though full on all sides, remains undisturbed, likewise he in whom all enjoyments merge themselves attains peace, not he who hankers after enjoyments.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">विहाय कामान् य: सर्वान् पुमांश्चरति नि:स्पृह:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">निर्ममो निरहंकार: स शान्तिमधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (II. 71)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who has given up all desires and moves free from attachment, egotism and the thirst for enjoyment attains peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The idea is that a man hankering after sense-enjoyments never attains peace inasmuch as his mind remains constantly agitated through a craving for various kinds of enjoyments; how can there be happiness where there is restlessness? Disquietude, worry, heart-burning and grief alone abide there. Therefore, giving up the thirst for all kinds of enjoyments of this world as also of the next and freed from egotism, the sense of mine and attachment, one should perform one’s duties enjoined bythe <span class="char-style-override-10">śāstras</span>. This too, constitutes a valuable means for attaining supreme peace.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Supreme peace is attained even by knowing God in reality, practising exclusive devotion to Him and taking refuge in Him. Says the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (V. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the supreme Lord of all the worlds, and the disinterested friend of all beings, My devotee attains peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Kaṭhopaniṣad</span>, Yama (the god of retribution) says to Naciketā—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नित्यो नित्यानां चेतनश्चेतनाना-</p>
<p class="Shlok">मेको बहूनां यो विदधाति कामान्।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(II. ii.13)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Lasting peace comes to those wise men alone who constantly perceive the spirit dwelling in their mind—the spirit who is constant among the constant, (nay), conscious among the conscious and who singly gratifies the desires of many (according to their past actions), and not to others.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We read in the <span class="char-style-override-10">śwetāśvatara Upaniṣad</span> too—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यो योनिं योनिमधितिष्ठत्येको</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">      (IV. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One attains the peace referred to above (in the form of final beatitude) without end on coming to know in reality that all-ruling Lord, the Bestower of boons, who is worth extolling, who alone controls all causes and into whom all this (creation) disappears (at the time of final dissolution) and again comes forth (at the time of creation).”</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">   (IV. 14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One attains peace without end on knowing in reality Lord śiva, the subtlest of the subtle, abiding in the cave of the heart, the creator of the universe, who is endowed with diverse forms and who alone pervades the universe.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span>, Sage Kavi, a lord of <span class="char-style-override-24">y</span><span class="char-style-override-10">ogīs</span>, says to King Nimi—</p>
<p class="Shlok">इत्यच्युताङ्घ्रिं भजतोऽनुवृत्त्या</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्तिर्विरक्तिर्भगवत्प्रबोध:।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">(XI. ii.43)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“In the votary of God, O king, who worships uninterruptedly as aforesaid the feet of śrī Hari (the immortal Lord), devotion, a distaste for the enjoyments of the world and direct knowledge of God appear (simultaneously); and through them he directly attains the state of Supreme Peace.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the subject of meditation the Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थित:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मन: संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्पर:॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी नियतमानस:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">शान्तिं निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VI. 14-15)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Firm in the vow of complete chastity and fearless, keeping himself perfectly calm and with his mind held in restraint and fixed on Me, the vigilant <span class="char-style-override-17">y</span>ogī should sit absorbed in Me. Thus constantly applying his mind to Me, the <span class="char-style-override-17">y</span>ogī of disciplined mind attains the everlasting peace, consisting of Supreme Bliss, which abides in Me.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Further on in Discourse XVIII the Lord declares that Peace is attained by taking refuge in the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">तमेव शरणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तत्प्रसादात्  परां शान्तिं स्थानं प्राप्स्यसि शाश्वतम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Seek Him alone as shelter with all your being, O Arjuna ! By His grace (alone) you will attain supreme peace and the eternal state.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In this way Supreme Peace has been declared as attainable through all the three Paths of Action, Knowledge and Devotion and all the three Paths are superior in everyway in their own place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> disinterestedness has been declared as superior to all in the following verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रेयो हि ज्ञानमभ्यासाज्ज्ञानाद् ध्यानं विशिष्यते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(XII.12)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Knowledge is better than practice (without discernment), meditation on God is superior to knowledge and renunciation of the reward of actions is superior (even) to meditation; for peace immediately follows from renunciation.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The idea is that that discipline alone is the foremost, which is characterized by perfect disinterestedness and while glorifying it the Lord also says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अनाश्रित: कर्मफलं कार्यं कर्म करोति य:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स संन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रिय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">(VI. 1)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who does his duty without expecting the fruit of actions is a <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsī</span> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span>) and a <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span> (a <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayogī</span>) both. He is no <span class="char-style-override-10">Saṁnyāsī </span>(renouncer) who has merely renounced the sacred fire; even so he is no <span class="char-style-override-24">y</span><span class="char-style-override-10">ogī</span> who has merely given up all activity.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The purport is that he who has renounced the sacred fire is no Saṁnyāsī if he is not actuated by a disinterested spirit and even so he who has given up all activity is no <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span> if he is not actuated by a disinterested spirit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A striver treading the Path of Devotion has been declared as superior to all in the following verse—</p>
<p class="Shlok">योगिनामपि सर्वेषां मद्गतेनान्तरात्मना।</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रद्धावान् भजते यो मां स मे युक्ततमो मत:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VI. 47)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Of all <span class="char-style-override-24">y</span><span class="char-style-override-10">ogīs</span>, again, he who devoutly worships Me with his mind focussed on Me is considered by Me to be the <span class="char-style-override-24">y</span><span class="char-style-override-10">ogī</span> par excellence.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Establishing the superiority of Knowledge the Lord likewise says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञ: परंतप।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">  (IV. 33)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Sacrifice through Knowledge is superior to sacrifice performed with material things, O scorcher of foes ! For all actions without exception culminate in Knowledge, O son of Kuntī !”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">In this way all these three courses of discipline have been declared as superior, easy to follow, speedily conducive to blessedness, capable of eradicating sin and bestowing true wisdom and helpful in realizing God, who is no other than, Supreme Peace. Hence that course of discipline alone is superior to all other courses of discipline for which the striver has developed reverence, faith, a liking and love. Realizing this and falling back on that very course of discipline he should diligently pursue it so that Supreme Peace may come to him.<span></span></p>


<p class="Page-Break"> </p>
<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-22">How to Realize God in an Instant?</p>
<p class="Shlok">मूकं करोति वाचालं पङ्गु लङ्घयते गिरिम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">यत्कृपा तमहं वन्दे परमानन्दमाधवम्॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I bow to Lord Viṣṇu (the Spouse of Goddess Lakṣmī), who is Supreme Bliss personified, and whose Grace makes a dumb person eloquent and enables a cripple to cross a mountain.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A certain gentleman has asked me to specify the ‘moment’ in which one may realize God at once. In reply to this question I would submit by way of illustration that a house which has been fitted with electric wiring and bulbs etc., and supplied with electric connection is lighted the moment we press the button, and the darkness prevailing there also disperses that very moment. Similarly when a spiritual aspirant becomes ‘qualified’ and fully equipped in everyway, the knowledge about God dawns on him in an instant and as soon as the enlightenment comes ignorance disappears and God-realization takes place. To take another familiar illustration, a man who is labouring under a misconception in regard to the points of the compass mistakes the east for the west and <span class="char-style-override-10">vice versa</span>. But whenever the misconception is cleared it is cleared in a moment and a correct notion of the quarters follows that very moment. Similarly when the enlightenment about God comes, all false notions disappear even like the misconception about the points of the compass, and the true nature of God is realized. To take a third illustration, suppose a man who is asleep at night is dreaming. Meanwhile, due to some reason he wakes up. Now as soon as he wakes up the entire dream-world melts away in a moment—it altogether ceases to be. Similarly, when we wake up in the Supreme Spirit, <span class="char-style-override-10">i.e</span>., once we get established in identity with the divine essence and our eyes of wisdom open, this world of matter entirely vanishes. Even as a dream vanishes as soon as we wake up, this phenomenal world disappears and God-realization takes place.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The misconception about the quarters is cleared automatically in due course or it gets resolved when one returns to one’s birth-place. And the dreaming man automatically wakes up the moment he comes to realize his dream to be a dream; or he can wake up even on being awakened by another. Similarly the enlightenment which automatically dawns on a man as a result of his incessantly viewing the world as a dream consequent upon a profound study of the scriptures is what has been referred to above as waking up of one’s own accord (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> IV. 38). And the enlightenment that comes to a man on his resorting for guidance to an exalted soul is equivalent to waking up on being awakened by another (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> IV. 34-35). Now reverting to the illustration of a man labouring under a misconception about the quarters, we have already seen how correct vision returns to his bewildered eyes as soon as he goes back to his native place. Similarly God-realization comes to a man the moment he reaches his birth-place in the form of getting established in identity with the divine essence. The divine essence is our birth-place; that is our essential and primordial nature. Hence the moment we are established in the divine essence the illusion of the world vanishes. Just as the misconception regarding the points of the compass, which made the east appear as the west and <span class="char-style-override-10">vice versa</span>, gets cleared up and correct vision returns, even so the delusion which was responsible for the appearance of this world in God is also resolved. Or just as the misconception regarding the quarters gets automatically cleared, even so the illusion of this world is automatically lifted in the case of certain individuals as a result of their constantly viewing the world as a dream. And when the mind is perfectly tranquil and perspicacious and feels an aversion for the pleasures of sense at the same time, enlightenment comes of its own accord. If under such circumstances one receives instruction from a saint in the truth relating to God, true enlightenment about God is definitely assured (<span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> IV. 34-35). And at the last moment of one’s life the very contemplation on God instantly leads to God-realization. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन् मुक्त्वा कलेवरम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">य: प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशय:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VIII. 5)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who departs from the body, thinking of Me alone even at the time of death, attains My state, there is no doubt about it.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Similarly the Lord says in II. 72 of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">एषा ब्राह्मी स्थिति: पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">स्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Such is the state of one who has realized God. O Arjuna (son of Kuntī); having reached this state, he overcomes delusion. And established in this state even at the last moment (of one’s life), he attains Brahmic bliss.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Such is the glory of attaining this state even at the last moment of one’s life. Similarly an aspirant gains a lot if he gives up the ghost at a time when he is established in the quality of Sattva. In <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XIV. 18 it is stated that “those who abide in Sattvaguṇa went their way upwards <span class="char-style-override-15">(</span><span class="char-style-override-14">ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्था:</span><span class="char-style-override-15">)</span>.” Although this means that he alone who constantly abides in the quality of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva</span> ascends to the higher regions, it may be pointed out that a man attains a good destiny if he is established in <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span> even at the last moment of his life or even if he gives up the ghost at a time when the quality of Sattva is predominant in him. The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदा सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे तु प्रलयं याति देहभृत्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">तदोत्तमविदां लोकानमलान् प्रतिपद्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XIV. 14)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“When a man dies during the preponderance of Sattva, he obtains the stainless ethereal worlds (heaven etc.) attained by men of noble deeds.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord evidently means thereby that such a man ascends to the higher regions and, proceeding further, reaches God—the supreme abode of God. This topic has been discussed at length in the commentary on <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> VIII. 24 in <span class="char-style-override-10">GītāTattva Number</span> II (No. 1 of Vol. XIII) of the <span class="char-style-override-10">“Kalyana-Kalpataru”</span>. This is what they call <span class="char-style-override-10">Krama-Mukti </span>(Gradual Liberation). Just as it is a special feature of the last moment of one’s life that even a man of <span class="char-style-override-10">Rājasika</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Tāmasika</span> disposition who departs from this world meditating on the Lord or with a clear conception of the truth relating to God is able to realize Him, even so the truth relating to God is easily realized at a time when <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span> prevails. It is a very propitious time—as important and convenient as the last moment of one’s life. One should strive for meditation with particular care at such a time; for even with a little effort during this period one can achieve great results. But how are we to understand whether the preponderance of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span> has already commenced. The Lord tells us a criterion. He says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वद्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन् प्रकाश उपजायते।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद् विवृद्धं सत्त्वमित्युत॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XIV. 11)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“When light and discernment dawn in this body, as well as in the mind and senses, then one should know that <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva</span> is predominant.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a man meditates on God or endeavours to know the truth relating to God during the predominance of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span>, he succeeds very quickly. At such a time God-realization is possible through Divine Grace even in a moment. During such a period man should spend his time solely in Self-realization and meditation with a mind full of dispassion, or in the company of exalted souls and, after hearing their teachings, in striving according to the same—in establishing himself in the same. By doing so it is not impossible to realize the Truth even in an instant. This is a most remarkable phenomenon. Just as one attains the highest state by giving up the ghost while meditating or contemplating on God at the last moment of one’s life, a similar thing happens during the predominance of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa </span>as well. Therefore, when the body, mind, senses and intellect are all alert, all are illumined as it were both within and without and there is an abundance of consciousness, when there are no tribulations and there is a feeling of tranquillity and <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> joy, these should be taken to indicate the preponderance of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattvaguṇa</span>. In such a state even a little effort for meditation on God may yield remarkable results.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We cited above the illustration of electric light and saw how on a house being fitted with electric wires etc., and supplied with the electric current from the power-station you get light as soon as you press the button. Even so, as a result of continued <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span>, when a man gets fully equipped and qualified and his mind is linked with God, he instantly realizes Him. Just as the house is illumined and darkness dispelled the moment you press the button, a little instruction brings enlightenment and God-realization to the seeker in a moment when the latter is fully equipped and qualified and ripe for such realization. As a result of meditation on God, a study of good books, deep thought and listening to the talks of noble souls and through grace of God one can have spontaneous awakening in the heart and realize God in a moment. To become qualified or fit is what is meant by getting equipped. This eligibility or fitness is acquired only when the mind gets purified. Hence allowance must be made for the time which is taken by the mind to get purified. The mind gets purified only when it is rid of its impurity and distraction and the veil of ignorance removed by following the disciplines of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti </span>(Devotion), <span class="char-style-override-10">Karma</span> (Disinterested Action) and <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span> (Self-knowledge). With the elimination of those three evils the truth relating to God flashes on the mind and God-realization takes place in a trice, even as a room is lighted as soon as you press the button. We are told in the following verse of <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmadBhagavadgītā</span> how the practice of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span> (the discipline of Self-knowledge) brings about God-realization—</p>
<p class="Shlok">भक्त्या मामभिजानाति यावान् यश्चास्मि तत्त्वत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ततो मां तत्त्वतो ज्ञात्वा विशते तदनन्तरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XVIII. 55)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Though that supreme devotion (in the shape of true knowledge concerning God) he comes to know Me in reality, what and how great I am; and thereby knowing Me in essence he forthwith enters into My being.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This represents the state of equipment. The verse immediately preceding it gives us the distinctive marks of this state—</p>
<p class="Shlok">ब्रह्मभूत: प्रसन्नात्मा न शोचति न कांक्षति।</p>
<p class="Shlok">सम: सर्वेषु भूतेषु मद्भक्तिं लभते पराम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XVIII. 54)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Established in identity with <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> (who is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss solidified) and cheerful of mind, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāṅkhyayogī</span> no longer grieves nor craves for anything. In other words, he is completely rid of all worries, grief and desires and sees unity in all beings. He then attains Supreme Devotion to Me (the culmination of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛāna</span>).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">It may be asked here—What is meant by seeing unity in all beings ? The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि।</p>
<p class="Shlok">ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शन:॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VI. 29)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span> who is united in identity with the All-pervading infinite consciousness and sees unity everywhere beholds the Self present in all beings (as water in ice), and all beings existing in the Self as a mere projection of his thought. That is to say, even as a man who has just awoken from a dream sees the dream-world in his own self as a projection of his thought, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogī</span> referred to above beholds all beings in his own self, which is of the nature of All-pervading infinite consciousness. In other words, he beholds himself in all beings in the real sense.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is what is meant by seeing unity everywhere. From this perception of unity follows what they call the highest consummation of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span>, which has also been designated as supreme devotion. Through this supreme devotion a man is able to know God in reality. He grasps the truth relating to all the aspects of God, viz., God with form and without form, God with attributes and without attributes and God both manifest and unmanifest. He then attains oneness with God. But before he does so he must fully equip himself for this consummation. As a preparation for this he must mould himself according to the three foregoing verses, which delineate the steps leading to the highest consummation of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga </span>and run as under—</p>
<p class="Shlok">बुद्‍ध्या विशुद्धया युक्तो धृत्यात्मानं नियम्य च।</p>

<p class="Shlok">विमुच्य निर्मम: शान्तो ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (XVIII. 51—53)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Endowed with an intellect absolutely untarnished (wholly free from impurity in the form of sin) and taking a light, <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> and regulated diet, living in a lonely and undefiled place, having altogether rejected sound and other objects of sense and subdued the mind, speech and body by restraining the mind and senses through firmness of a <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span> type, taking a resolute stand on dispassion, after having completely got rid of attraction and aversion, and remaining ever devoted to the Yoga of meditation, having given up egotism, violence, arrogance, lust, anger and luxuries, devoid of the feeling of meum and tranquil at heart—such a man becomes qualified for oneness with <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> (who is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When a man is established in meditation, all the morbidities of his heart get eradicated and sense-objects of various kinds are also withheld from him. The impurity of his heart having already been wiped out, distraction also now disappears. In this way when he is completely rid of all evils, he becomes fit for realizing his oneness with <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. He is now established in identity with the Absolute and he who is established in oneness with the Absolute is called ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmabhūta</span>.’ The state which follows as a sequel to the state of a <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmabhūta</span> has already been delineated above. The attainment of supreme devotion or the highest consummation of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span> directly follows the state of <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahmabhūta</span>. This culmination of knowledge eradicates ignorance. It is this eradication of ignorance which constitutes the tearing of the veil that conceals the true nature of things. In this way God-realization takes place as soon as the three evils of impurity, distraction and ignorance are eradicated. That is why God-realization itself has been declared to be the fruit of the highest consummation of <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span>. In this way when the aspirant becomes fit for God-realization by gradually equipping himself for the same, he realizes God in a trice and, after realizing Him, gets merged in Him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">As for the man who has awoken from a dream he repeatedly recalls the world of his dream and feels that in the dreamstate he looked upon the body as his very self and the world outside him as an objective reality; but on waking he realizes that his self-identification with the body as well as the perception of the dream-world were both figments. An enlightened soul, however, no longer recalls the world even as a figment. When the world itself has ceased to exist, what will he think of in terms of ‘I’ and “this”? Subsequent to God-realization the world altogether ceases to be. While the man who has awoken from a dream look-upon the dream-world as a figment, in the eye of the man who has awoken from the dream of the world, the world no longer exists even as a dream. For, while the man who has awoken from a dream continues to have the same mind and reason which he had during the dream, in the case of the man who has realized <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> the mind and reason are left behind with the body. For Brahma is beyond the reach of mind, reason and body. Then who is to view the world even as a dream and how? Nevertheless it is said that to an enlightened soul the world is like a dream. Here it may be asked—When the world does not exist at all, why do they speak of it as analogous to a dream? Our reply to this is that, as a matter of fact to theman who has realized <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> the world does not appear even as a dream; for in his eye the world does not exist at all. The world neither appears to him nor exists for him. It has absolutely no existence. For him there is nothing other than himself and he, too, has existed from eternity. The world, of course, does have a body of his, and the body has a mind and reason—an internal sense. In this internal sense either, really speaking, there is no trace of this world nor of the body and the internal sense referred to above; it is filled with the presence of God. Nevertheless it is said of that enlightened soul that for him the world including the mind is analogous to a dream. Who can tell the glory of such an exalted soul? The realization that ‘God exists’ is itself a proof of His existence. The entire body of scriptures is nothing but the realization of such exalted souls. There can be no greater testimony than the realization of those exalted souls, which is absolutely immediate.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Now let us make an effort to understand something about God. There are two aspects of God—(i) the absolute formless Divinity, who is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss solidified and (ii) God with form and attributes. God with attributes, again, is either with or without form. He who pervades the whole creation in His <span class="char-style-override-24">s</span><span class="char-style-override-10">aguṇa</span> yet formless aspect is called by the names of God and the Supreme Spirit. As God with form and attributes He eternally abides in His Divine Abode and from time to time descends into the world of matter of His own free will. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Satyayuga </span>He appeared in the form of śrī Viṣṇu, in the age of Tretā in the person of śrī Rāma and in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dwāpara</span> age as śrī Kr̥ṣṇa.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The neo-Vedantist, subscribing as he does to the doctrine ‘<span class="char-style-override-10">Ajātavāda</span>’, recognizes no other entity than <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span>. His belief in the one reality called <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> is perfectly logical. But his views regarding the <span class="char-style-override-24">s</span><span class="char-style-override-10">aguṇa</span> yet formless Divinity—whom we call by the name of God, who is the Creator of the universe, the Protector, Knower, Witness and Seer of all and who appears in various divine manifestations (<span class="char-style-override-10">Avatāras</span>)—are not quite sound to my mind. He speaks of God (<span class="char-style-override-10">ºśwara</span>) as a product of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>. He tells us that “When the cosmos is  no longer there, the <span class="char-style-override-17">s</span>aguṇa aspects of God both with and without form also cease to exist, and that the one attributeless and formless Brahma alone really exists for ever.” But, really speaking, the <span class="char-style-override-17">s</span>aguṇa aspects of God both with and without form never cease to be even when the world is no more. The world is a display of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>—a product of matter. The <span class="char-style-override-17">s</span>aguṇa aspects of God both with and without form constitute the very essence of God and are spiritual in character. Of course, when the Lord descends into the world of matter, He certainly screens Himself with a veil of Māyā; that is why His true character remains hidden to the ignorant. This is what the Lord says in the following verse of <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhagavadgītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">नाहं प्रकाश: सर्वस्य योगमायासमावृत:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">मूढोऽयं नाभिजानाति लोको मामजमव्ययम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (VII. 25)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Veiled by My <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogamāyā</span> (divine potency), I am not manifest to all. Hence these ignorant folk do not recognize Me as the unborn and imperishable Supreme Spirit (<span class="char-style-override-10">i.e</span>., take Me to be subject to birth and death).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Surely the Lord removes this curtain of His <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogamāyā</span> before His reverent and loving devotees, who are thus able to know—perceive Him in His true character. It is only before the unqualified and the ignorant that He screens Himself with a veil.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">Here it should be borne in mind that Lords śrī Rāma and śrī Kr̥ṣṇa possess a form similar to the human body; that is why They are believed to follow the ways of human beings. Lord Viṣṇu, on the other hand, is endowed with a form resembling that of gods; the stuff of which His Body is constituted is more or less akin to the celestial stuff. That is why Their visible forms severally resemble human and celestial bodies; but in essence They are divine and spiritual, and in no way Mayic in character. Really speaking, it is the absolute formless <span class="char-style-override-10">Brahma</span> that appears as the Saguṇa Divinity with and without form. The neo-Vedantist does not accept this view. He is ignorant of the truth and secret pointed out above. It is the divine and immaterial virtues of the Lord that are reflected on the quality of <span class="char-style-override-10">Sattva</span> in this world of matter. The noble qualities forming part of the divine endowment spoken of in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> are <span class="char-style-override-10">Sāttvika</span>, though products of <span class="char-style-override-10">Māyā</span>. The virtues appearing in Sattvaguṇna are all reflections of a ray of the divine virtues. Just as a reflection of the lunar orb is seen in a mirror, the divine excellences appear in the form of ideal virtues in a pure and sinless mind. Yet they are material and not spiritual. <br/>The virtues of the Lord, however, are purely divine and immaterial.<span></span></p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“Halloo, what has brought you so far away from your home ?” asked the friend who lived in the Punjab, extending a hearty welcome to the newcomer. It was no longer difficult for him to understand that there must have been some special reason for his coming all the way from Rajputana.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Famine is stalking our land. There is a great scarcity of foodgrains and people are dying of starvation. Pangs of hunger have driven me to your place.” The newcomer, who was a <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya </span>hailing from Rajputana, uttered the plain truth. Heaps of grain lying in his friend’s compound gladdened his heart.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“You did well in coming over to this place. Treat my house as your own and make yourself comfortable here,” replied the friend in great endearment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I find heaps of grain lying strewn here, whereas on our side it is visible only to the fortunate few. There is a scramble going on there for every grain of cereals as between crows and kites. The sight of tons of grain stored in your house has brought life to me.” The Vaiśya made himself more explicit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“By the grace of God there is no dearth of foodgrains in these parts. This is no matter for wonder either; anyone who comes here will not lack foodgrains. You being a friend of mine, everything belonging to me is yours. It was very wise of you to have come over here,” the friend observed. He was a clever and seasoned farmer.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Everything belonging to you is mine, I have no doubt about it; but I should like to know wherefrom you got all this stock of foodgrains,” the wondering <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> inquired.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“We are engaged in agriculture all the year round. This is the reward of our year-long toil,” replied the farmer trying to satisfy his Vaiśya friend. “You, too, will have heaps of grain if you take to agriculture.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“This is a capital idea. I shall also devote myself to the pursuit of agriculture; but I have no experience of this avocation. I have got a thousand rupees with me. Can I make a beginning with this amount ?” inquired the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“One thousand rupees is not a paltry sum. You can make a very good beginning in agriculture with this amount. My unstinted co-operation will also be available to you as a matter of course,” replied the farmer in a sympathetic tone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I for my part have no idea of this work. Do as you deem fit,” observed the Vaiśya, handing over the whole amount in his possession to the farmer.</p>
<p class="Uwach">****</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Look here, the whole stock of seeds has been reduced to dust! Every grain of wheat is split and has gone to the dogs,” complained the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> in great despondency. He had not interfered with any plan of his Punjabi friend, who had purchased seeds etc., out of the money advanced by him and got the fields ploughed. The seeds had been sown. But the ignorant <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> was feeling uneasy to see all this. A couple of days had hardly elapsed when he visited the field and unearthed the seeds in order to see what had happened to them. He found that good many of them had sprouted; this led him to suspect that his whole money had been wasted. <br/>In great sorrow he addressed the above words to his friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Sprouts have begun to shoot in your field. You need not harbour any anxiety. The seeds are full of promise. You have no idea of these things.” With these words the farmer consoled his <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> friend.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I expect no gain even after having spent money and labour. I for my part feel much worried.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> clearly revealed the agony of his heart. “This is what happens in the beginning. You should be free from worry. Your crop is very promising.” Such was the loving assurance of the farmer.</p>
<p class="Uwach">****<span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Grass and grass alone is visible everywhere in my field. I have suffered a great loss. The whole of my investment has been thrown away.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> made the same complaint to the farmer after some days. He had mistaken the wheat plants, which had grown span high, for grass.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The bewildered farmer visited the field himself, but he was much pleased to see the waving crop.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Oh! your field has overshadowed all adjoining fields.” The farmer corrected his despairing friend. <br/>“You should take it for granted that a large heap of wheat is about to accumulate on your land. But you must take care that the plants are not allowed to wither. Water is the life of these tender plants. You should make speedy arrangements for its supply. Promptly dig a well for watering them. At the same time enclose the field with a fence of thorns lest stray animals should eat down the plants. You will have to guard the field carefully.’’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I shall literally follow every instruction of yours,” assured the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span>. And he did the same. He dug a well and watered the plants abundantly. By the grace of God the clouds also came to his aid and sent occasional showers. The plants began to grow.</p>
<p class="Uwach">****</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Weed out every single blade of grass that has grown between the plants. They obstruct the growth of the plants.” Repairing to the field, one day, the farmer issued the above instruction to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> in a loving tone.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Not a single blade of grass will be allowed to remain in the field,” returned the Vaiśya in a reassuring  vein.</p>
<p class="Uwach">****</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Grains of wheat have made their appearance in the ears of the plants; but they are all unripe,” the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> complained to his friend wiping out the sweat off his brow. He came running from the field and had gone out of breath. In obedience to the instruction of his farmer friend he had left no blade of grass on his field. He had taken immense pains. The plants had also borne fruit. But after such a long time he found that the seeds were all unripe. Having no knowledge of agriculture, the poor fellow had lost his nerve. He thought that along with his money his hard labour too was proving infructuous. He also placed before the farmer two or three ears of corn that he had brought with him.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“The cereals of your crop are very mature. They will ripen shortly. It won’t take much time. You need not worry. Nor should you brood over the matter. You will have a mountain of wheat and fodder by your side,” assured the Vaiśya in cheering words. “But at this juncture birds make their appearance, and singing melodiously eat up the whole crop; hence it will have to be scrupulously guarded. Unless protected from them the entire crop will be destroyed by these birds.”</p>
<p class="Uwach">****<span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am grateful to you. My joy knows no bounds. I have a large heap of wheat by my side.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> expressed his gratitude to his friend in cheerful accents.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“All this is due to God’s grace and your own industry. Turning a deaf ear to the warbling of birds, you kept yourself solely engaged in scaring them away. You pursued your avocation in right earnest.” The farmer gave the whole credit to his <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> friend.</p>
<p class="Uwach">****<span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> bent his head in gratitude. Joy was beaming on his countenance.</p>
<p class="Uwach">****<span></span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">The above story has been narrated by way of a parable. In the spiritual realm the famine-stricken <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> should be taken to represent the seeker striving for the attainment of true happiness. The former’s craving for foodgrains occasioned by pangs of hunger should be taken to represent the worldly trials and tribulations. The farmer friend of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span>, living in the Punjab, should be understood to symbolize an exalted soul. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya’s</span> calling on his friend in the Punjab from Rajputana should be taken to symbolize the seeker’s call on a saint at the latter’s residence from his own home. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya’s</span> carrying his tale of suffering to his friend stands for the seeker’s confiding his woes to the man of wisdom. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya’s</span> handing over all his money to his friend stands for the aspirant’s dedicating the rest of his life at the feet of the saint. Investing money according to the friend’s advice illustrates the Sādhakas spending his time to the best advantage according to the bidding of the man of wisdom. The farmer’s procuring land and seeds for his friend illustrates the holy man’s exhortation to the aspirant to make the best use of his time. Forgoing one’s bodily comforts in the interest of agriculture typifies the renunciation of worldly happiness in this life for the attainment of supreme bliss. The sowing of seeds in the soil typifies the treasuring in one’s heart of the secret formula of spiritual discipline imparted by an exalted soul. The mental agony and despair which overtook the <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśy</span>a due to his ignorance on the sprouting of seeds in the field in course of his pursuit of agriculture should be taken to represent the dark night of the soul and the suffering caused by the same in the course of one’s <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span>. The Vaisya’s mistaking the tiny plants of wheat for weeds represents the tendency on the part of an aspirant during the period of his spiritual discipline to mistake his <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhanā</span>, in spite of the progress made by him in that field, as fruitless labour rather than a spiritual discipline because of the considerable strain involved therein. The enclosure of thorns should be taken to symbolize control of the mind and senses. Guarding the crop against birds stands for refraining from wasting one’s spiritual energy by associating with self-interested men of the world. Digging a well and watering the field should be taken to symbolize the muttering of the Divine Name, dwelling on the divine form of the Lord along with His virtues and glory and study of sacred books. Timely showers through the grace of God should be construed as typifying automatic practice of Japa and meditation. Destruction of weeds in the parable stands for the elimination of immoral traits and evil designs from the mind. The fructifying of the wheat plants should be understood as typifying steadiness of meditation on God, and the warbling of birds visiting the field for feeding on the cereals should be taken to represent the tributes of praise offered to the aspirant by selfish men. Driving away birds for the protection of the crop should be construed to symbolize a contempt for praise and glory and ignoring those bestowing the same; and the ripening of the cereals as well as reaping and gathering them should be understood to typify the cessation of all sorrows and the attainment of God, the embodiment of supreme bliss.<span></span></p>

<p class="Heading" id="toc_marker-24">Value Your Sādhana More Than the End Itself</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Whatever means there are for attaining God-realization should be valued more than God-realization itself. By holding one’s <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> in high esteem one’s progress in <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> is accelerated. Generally we undervalue our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>. That is why <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> remains slack and success continues to be remote. The great sage PataÛjali has declared that <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> alone to be of a high order which is carried on with esteem. He says—</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">Many strivers complain that in spite of their going through a course of discipline they fail to achieve success. What they say is true; but their failure to achieve success is due to their not pursuing their Sādhana in a reverent mood and in a disinterested spirit. Most of the strivers keep their eyes fixed on the fruit of their <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>. That is why and further due to lack of faith the Sādhana is not reverently pursued. It is therefore that the result does not appear to be what they expect. It is therefore that there is no zeal in their Sādhana and a sense of frustration overtakes them resulting in slackness. Hence it behoves man to do his duty reverently and never direct his eyes towards its reward.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The Lord says in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>—</p>
<p class="Shlok">कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।</p>

<p class="TXT-Right">  (II. 47)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Your right is to work only, but never to the fruit. Do not be instrumental in making your actions bear fruit, nor let your attachment be to inaction.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">In order to bring out the unmistakable character of disinterested service we reproduce a parable below.<span class="char-style-override-11">*</span> There lived in a certain land a saintly king, who was a supreme devotee and one who had realized the truth. He was celebrated all round. There was one Rāmū, a Kahāra (a bearer of palanquins) by caste. He was seized with a desire to see the king and with this end in view he thought of a device and sought his friend, Gopāla Kahāra, who had been in the service of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> of the aforesaid King. Rāmū, as soon as he saw Gopāla, fell at the latter’s feet and said, “You are blessed indeed !” Gopāla protested at this unusual behaviour of Rāmū and said, “why should you fall at my feet ? We are after all friends.” “Don’t you know, brother?” rejoined Rāmū. “That the ruler of this land is a highly enlightened and noble soul and a supreme devotee ? You have the good luck of being in the service of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> of his <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>. As such you are worthy of adoration to me. Please secure an employment for me too in this house.” Thereupon Gopāla broached the matter to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span>. The latter was in need of an additional servant and Rāmū was accordingly taken into service. At the end of a month the Peśakāra handed over to Gopāla a consolidated sum of twenty rupees by way of remuneration for both at the rate of Rupees ten per month, then prevailing. Gopāla took his monthly emolument. Rāmū, however, did not accept his own and told Gopāla that he had not sought that service for the sake of any emolument. The golden opportunity, he added, which he had thereby secured of serving the Peśakāra was itself a high emolument for him. At the close of the next month when the Peśakāra offered the salary of the two servants, Gopāla declined to accept it on the plea that Rāmū had not accepted his salary even for the preceding month, so that an extra amount of ten rupees had been lying in deposit with him, which might accordingly be debited to his (Gopāla’s) account.</p>
<p class="Footnotes-English">* The story has already appeared with some modifications here and there in one of my articles published in the Kalyana-Kalpataru.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Thereupon the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> summoned Rāmū in his presence and insisted on the latter accepting his rightful dues. Rāmū, however, flatly declined and respectfully said, “I am not serving you, my master, for the sake of a few coins. Your service itself is a gain more valuable to me than salary. You must be knowing that His Majesty is an enlightened noble soul, a supreme devotee and saint; you are the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> of his <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>. The golden opportunity of beholding and serving you has been secured by me through great luck. What remuneration greater than this could there be for me?” “Tell me then”, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> said, “with what end in view are you slaving to me without any consideration?” “I do your work with this object” replied Rāmū, “that through service continually rendered to you I may be enabled some day to see face to face the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> himself, who has the good fortune of being His Majesty’s Prime Minister.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> said, “I can show you the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> even tomorrow.” “It is so kind of you,” Rāmū gratefully replied. “Get tea and water for me in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span> office at 8 A.M. tomorrow” added the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span>. Rāmū did as he was told.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Going to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span> office Rāmū stood silently gazing at the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> like one spellbound. The Dewan inquired who he was and what for he had come. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> told his boss that since he had come without taking his tea, the man, who was his personal servant, had brought tea for him. With the leave of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> took his tea aside. Rāmū set about scrubbing the cup and other utensils and this having been done, he dusted the shoes of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> and swept the dust wherever he found it. While doing all this, he kept his gaze constantly fixed on the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>. At this the Dewan remarked that the fellow was very useful in that, he did everything unasked for, and inquired as to how much he was paid. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> told the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> that the man did not accept any remuneration even though pressed much. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> thereupon summoned Rāmū in his presence and inquired of him what his object was in doing service in that way without any consideration. “My object,” replied Rāmū, “is to secure your blessed sight. I am indeed very lucky in having seen you today.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> asked him what gain he sought from his sight. “His Majesty”, replied Rāmū, “is a most saintly and enlightened devotee of the Lord and an exalted soul and you are his <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>. One gets purified even by your sight.” “If that is so,” said the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, “you had better accept service in my household.” To this Rāmū replied that he would deem his greatest fortune to be allowed to serve him. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan </span>now turned towards the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> and expressed his desire to employ Rāmū in his own household. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> offered to give him a servant even better than Rāmū. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, however, insisted on his taking Rāmū and kept him in his personal service.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">When Rāmū had been in the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span> service for many days, the latter pressed him to send some money to his own people. Rāmū, however, unequivocally declined and said, “Through your grace, my master, there is no dearth of money at my home. I have already submitted to you that it is not for the sake of money that I have sought service with you. Your service alone is the highest gain to me in that you are His Majesty’s own Prime Minister while His Majesty is a man of highest wisdom, a supreme devotee and a saintly personage.” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> importunately pressed him once more to send something for his (the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span>) gratification. Rāmū, however, categorically declined. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> then asked him what for he served him. Rāmū told him that he served the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> in order that he might thereby be enabled some day to behold His Majesty. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> undertook to show him His Majesty the very next day and asked him to be present at the Court of His Majesty at 1 p.m. with a tumbler of water for him. “Very well!” said Rāmū and did as he was told. On tomorrow he appeared in the Court of His Majesty punctually with a tumbler of water and gazed on His Majesty with unwinking eyes like one bewitched. His Majesty’s eyes fell on him. He inquired of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> as to who the man was and what had brought him. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> told His Majesty that in a hurry he had come without taking water after his meal and that the man, who was his personal servant, had accordingly brought water for him to drink. With His Majesty’s permission the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> took some water. Rāmū stayed on. He was blessed with an unusually comely appearance and the sight of His Majesty sent him into raptures. His countenance was beaming with joy. His Majesty continued to watch his movements. He felt unaccountably drawn towards the boy. Rāmū cleaned the utensils and set about dusting and arranging things quietly. Like bees hovering about a lotus, his eyes, remained riveted on His Majesty’s countenance along. His Majesty now turned to his Prime Minister and said, “This boy looks very smart. He picks up work without being asked for and does everything with ideal neatness and orderliness. He is intelligent too. By the way, what do you pay him ?” The Dewan told His Majesty that the fellow did not accept any remuneration even on being pressingly urged. His Majesty was greatly amazed to hear this. He called Rāmū by his side and asked him with what object he was serving the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> so whole-heartedly without any consideration. Rāmū replied that His Majesty’s sight was his only motive in serving the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> and through his blessed sight alone he felt accomplished of all purpose. “If that is so,” His Majesty remarked. “You had better stay with us.” Rāmū was overjoyed to hear this and submitted, “What higher gain could there be for me? My life itself will have realized its end if I secure the good fortune of serving the soles of Your Majesty’s blessed feet.” His Majesty then turned towards the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> and expressed his desire to keep Rāmū in his own personal service. Rāmū was a great favourite with the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, who was naturally reluctant to part with him. He, therefore mildly protested and offered to give another good servant to His Majesty. The latter, however, expressed once more his strong inclination to take Rāmū in his own service. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> was left no choice but to yield. Rāmū succeeded, as a matter of course, in securing a place in His Majesty’s own royal household.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Rāmū commenced his career as a personal servant of His Majesty with great joy, reverence, efficiency, affection and zeal. He won the pleasure of His Majesty through his service. He began to feel that even a worthy son could not render such services, much less a servant. Pleased with him, His Majesty offered him a very large sum of money to requisite his services and even pressed him to send a decent amount to his home. Rāmū, however, meekly declined saying, “Through God’s grace, my lord, there is everything in my house. I do not serve the soles of Your Majesty’s feet for the sake of abundant riches. The highest gain in the form of Your Majesty’s service is itself a great recompense for me. Your Majesty is a saint and a man of wisdom, a supreme devotee and an exalted soul. A man could be redeemed by your very sight, touch and talk with you. What wonder, then, that one should attain blessedness through service rendered to Your Majesty ! I stand accomplished of all purpose through your very sight. Over and above this Your Majesty has now been pleased to bestow on me the good fortune of personally serving you. What more remains to be attained by me? The object of my life has been accomplished, my lord!” “Ask of me,” the king still persisted, “anything you will for my pleasure.” “Even if he asks for my kingdom,” he thought, “I won’t mind it and will treat him as my son.” Rāmū then submitted, “If Your Majesty insists on giving me something, be pleased to assure me that neither will Your Majesty ever part me from your company nor will Your Majesty part company with me.” The King feelingly said, “Amen! Amen !!”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The following night when His Majesty was about to retire to his gynaeceum Rāmū too followed him. On being questioned Rāmū reminded the king of the boon so kindly granted to him by His Majesty and pressed his claim to remain wherever the king stayed. Entering the gynaeceum the king told Her Majesty that he had brought her a worthy son. The queen felt highly pleased because she had no issue. Since then she began to look upon Rāmū as her own son. The boy, too, viewed Their Majesties as his parents and set himself heart and soul to their service.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, His Majesty told Rāmū of his intention to retire to the woods and live in solitude, and offered to install Rāmū on his throne. The latter, however, declined and reminded His Majesty of the assurance given to him that His Majesty would neither part him from his company nor part company with him, and notified the king of his resolve to accompany His Majesty in case he proceeded to the woods. The king felt a bit concerned at this reply and said, “Who will look after the kingdom if both of us retire to the woods ?” Rāmū, who was entirely free from greed and was self-denial personified, suggested that the reins of government might as well be handed over to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>. Seeing his disinterested spirit the king decided to stick to the throne, but added at the same time, “I have a great mind to appoint you as my regent (<span class="char-style-override-10">Yuvarāja</span>).” Rāmū, however, insisted on His Majesty sticking to the throne and begged to be excused for his own disinclination to accept the office of <span class="char-style-override-10">Yuvarāja</span>, adding that he was whole-heartedly prepared to do whatever else he would be called upon to do.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">His Majesty then told Rāmū that he had to sign a number of official papers everyday in token of his approval and that it was a tiresome business for him. He would, therefore, feel much relieved if Rāmū did that for him. Rāmū had to agree to this proposal for the pleasure of His Majesty. The latter proclaimed in his court that Rāmū’s signature would thenceforward be considered to be his own signature.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Later on, one day, the king told Rāmū that he had to attend the court daily, but his body had grown weak and hence asked Rāmū to do that work also. Pressed by the king, Rāmū took up that duty as well. He attended the court and, remaining there for some time attended to the work of administration and signed all papers in token of his approval. Though he declined to accept the office of <span class="char-style-override-10">Yuvarāja</span>, he did all the work of His Majesty under his orders.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">He would be present in the court even before the arrival of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>. One day, while the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> was entering the court, Rāmū fell at his feet. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> protested and said that Rāmū, who at that time was the virtual ruler of the kingdom, should not behave like that. Rāmū replied that he was no other than his menial who scrubbed his unclean utensils. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, however, interrupted him saying that he was at that moment the regent of the kingdom and should not refer to himself in such derogatory terms. Rāmū, however, attributed all that to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span> grace and repeated that he had been the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span> menial and would continue to be so. With these words he clasped the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan’s</span> hand and led him to the royal throne. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, however, struggled and said that the throne was meant for him and not for the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, who was a servant of the crown. So saying he bowed to the throne and halted where he was without proceeding further.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On another day still later Rāmū behaved with the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> in a similar way when he saw the latter from a distance. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> felt very uncomfortable at this unexpected turn and wondered what had led the crown prince to do so. Rāmū, however, told the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> that he was the same man who scrubbed his unclean utensils and still continued to be his menial. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśkāra</span> reminded Rāmū that by God’s grace he had since risen to the position of crown prince and should not utter such humiliating words. Rāmū, however, still repeated that all that was due to the goodwill of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span>, whose servant he had been and still continued to be. So saying Rāmū took the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> too by the hand and conducted him to the royal throne. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra </span>demurred and expressed his inability to occupy the throne of His Majesty, which he said Rāmū alone was entitled to occupy and not the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span>. Rāmū, however, continued even then to pull the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> respectfully to the throne. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span>, who happened to pass by, intervened and pleaded with Rāmū saying, “How can the poor <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra </span>dare place his foot on a seat which even myself could not dream of occupying?” The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> did not move further.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">One day, the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra’s</span> personal servant, Gopāla, the quondam friend of Rāmū, happened to meet Rāmū, who at once ran and fell at his feet. Gopāla felt very uncomfortable and protested arguing that he was an abject menial. Rāmū, however, pleaded that he owed his all to the goodwill of Gopāla alone, whose friend and younger brother he had been and still was. With these words Rāmū struggled to take Gopāla to the royal throne, but how could the latter dream of accepting this honour. He halted where he was.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The story narrated in the preceding number is a sort of parable. It is intended to illustrate a spiritual truth. The king in the said parable, who has been depicted as an enlightened and exalted soul and a supreme devotee of God, should be understood as representing God, Himself. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> should be taken for a God-realized soul capable of leading others to God-realization. The <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span> should be taken to represent an advanced striver and the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra’s</span> servant as a servant of a striving soul. The royal court should be understood as representing the divine realm of the Lord and Rāmū <span class="char-style-override-10">Kahāra</span> should be taken to representan advanced striverin the guise of an humble servant full of disinterested love. The gradual promotion of Rāmū <span class="char-style-override-10">Kahāra</span> to a higher and higher status should be taken to illustrate the progress made by a striver in the field of spiritual discipline; and his ascension to the office of Regent as the attainment of the highest goal.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The moral we should draw from this parable is that, even as Rāmū spurned a large sum of money that would have proved helpful in maintaining his earthly family, and did not make much even of the office of Regent earned as a reward of his services, but preferred to it the service of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span>, those of us who may be treading the path of devotion to God should make much even of the service of a servant of servants of the Lord, spurning the greatest of worldly temptations. Just as Rāmū held the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan</span> in high esteem, we, too, should show great respect to men who are supremely devoted to the Lord, and more so to the Lord Himself. And even as Rāmū held His Majesty in the highest esteem, we should show the greatest reverence to the Lord in a disinterested spirit and be most submissive to Him. Just as Rāmū <span class="char-style-override-10">Kahāra</span>, even when exalted to the position of Regent, continued to show great respect to the <span class="char-style-override-10">Dewan </span>and his <span class="char-style-override-10">Peśakāra</span>, nay, he maintained the same attitude of friendliness towards even the latter’s servant (Gopāla), we should likewise never forget our indebtedness to those who may have helped us in our spiritual endeavour and through whose good offices we may have been enabled to attain the highest goal—nay, we should treasure them in our heart as an object of highest veneration and ever respect them; for exalted souls always treat others with great regard. The Lord Himself, though deserving of the highest honour, never seeks honour Himself but bestows it on others. In the <span class="char-style-override-10">Mahābhārata, Anuśāsana-Parva,</span> CXL. 93 we read the following about the Lord—</p>
<p class="Shlok">‘अमानी मानदो मान्य:’</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“Though deserving of honour (Himself), Lord Viṣṇu is free from self-esteem and bestows honour on others.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We too on this ground should bestow honour on others and never seek it ourselves.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">From the parable of Rāmū <span class="char-style-override-10">Kahāra</span>, narrated here, we should learn as its most valuable part the lesson or ideal service rendered in a disinterested spirit, and follow it in our actual life.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">This is what goes by the name of doing one’s duty without reference to its reward. Higher than this is the plane where spiritual discipline is esteemed more than the end itself. In our sacred books devotion to a husband has been recognized as the best means of attaining liberation for women, and service to parents and other elders as a royal road to liberation for men.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">On the subject of devotion to a husband our sisters would do well to read the narrative of a devoted wife named <span class="char-style-override-10">Sudhā</span>, forming part of the story of Narottama Brāhmaṇa, told in Discourse 47 of <span class="char-style-override-10">Padma-Purāṇa, Sr̥ṣṭi</span>-<span class="char-style-override-10">Khaṇḍa</span>, as well as the story of another devoted wife, Sukalā, partner of Kr̥kala, <span class="char-style-override-10">Vaiśya</span> by caste, narrated in Discourses 41 to 58 of <span class="char-style-override-10">Padma-Purāṇa, Bhūmi-Khaṇḍa</span>.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Anent the service of one’s parents and preceptor Lord Manu says—</p>
<p class="Shlok">त एव हि त्रयो लोकास्त एव त्रय आश्रमा:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">त एव हि त्रयो वेदास्त एवोक्तास्त्रयोऽग्नय:॥</p>

<p class="TEXT-English">“One’s parents and preceptor alone constitute the three worlds (heaven, earth and the space intervening them); they alone represent the three śramas (stages in life).

<p class="Shlok">एष धर्म: पर: साक्षादुपधर्मोऽन्य उच्यते॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right"> (<span class="char-style-override-10">Manusmr̥ti.</span> II. 237)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“A man’s obligation ends with the service of these three. This latter actually represents the foremost duty; every other duty is spoken of as subordinate.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">We have been hearing that in South India there lived one Puṇḍalīka, who was a devotee of his parents. The moment he realized the value and glory of serving one’s parents he started serving his parents as no other than God. Later on he moved to Pandharpur and took up his abode there along with his parents. Rising early in the morning and after easing his nature and finishing his bath he turned to the service of his parents. Helping them to ease their nature and take their bath he used to cook food for them and fed them, and took his meals only after they had been fed. He then scrubbed the unclean utensils including the plates etc., in which they had been fed, gave them decent clothes to cover their bodies with and provided them with excellent beds to sleep on. He further kneaded their feet, gave them water to drink, fanned them and ministered to their comfort in every other way according to the changing conditions of weather. In this way he served his parents.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Pleased with his service to the parents, the Lord Himself came to see him one day and stood behind him saying, “Puṇḍalīka! here am I to see you. I am the Lord Himself.” Without turning towards Him, Puṇḍalīka told the Lord by mute signals that his parents were lying asleep with their head resting each on one of his own thighs and asked Him to keep mum lest their sleep should be disturbed. He further assured the Lord that he would meet Him when his parents had woken, and pushed a brick at his back for the Lord to sit on and wait. The Lord expressed wonder at this strange behaviour of Puṇḍalīka, who did not find time to see the Lord even though he had come all the way to meet him. Puṇḍalīka replied that he had never invited the Lord, who ought to have called at an hour convenient to him. It was no fault of his, he added, that the Lord had come at an odd hour. The Lord then told Puṇḍalīka that it was the latter’s devotion to his parents that had attracted Him to that place. Puṇḍalīka wanted to know if devotion to one’s parents was potent enough to compel the Lord to call on him without being invited. On the Lord confirming this fact, Puṇḍalīka said, “If that is so, how could You expect me to give up such valuable devotion to my parents and meet You ? You must, therefore, wait in order to be able to see me.” Pleased at this straightforward reply of Puṇḍalīka, the Lord came face to face with Puṇḍalīka and said, “Since you have given priority to service of your parents even over Me, I am much pleased with this behaviour of yours. Ask of Me any boon you will.” Puṇḍalīka only prayed that he should continue to cherish unwavering reverence and love for service to his parents. The Lord granted his prayer with the word “Amen!” </p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Just as Puṇḍalīka, a devotee of his parents, gave priority to his <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> in the form of service to his parents even over his goal in the shape of God-realization, we, too, should value spiritual disciplines such as <span class="char-style-override-10">JÛānayoga</span>, <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhaktiyoga</span> and <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> more than God-realization itself. The idea is that whichever of the manifold courses of discipline we pursue, we ought to do so with utmost reverence and love and in a meek and disinterested spirit secretly without interruption as a matter of duty, never turning our eyes towards its fruit. If, however, there is something wanting in our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>, we must of course be on our guard every moment.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If, for instance, we are treading on the path of knowledge, we should judge our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana </span>according to the standard set up at some length in <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XVIII, 50 to 55. If our <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> lacks in any detail mentioned there, special effort should be made to make up that deficiency without reference of course to the fruit of such endeavour in the shape of God-realization.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">A striver on the path of Devotion too should likewise review his <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span>. Detailing the discipline of <span class="char-style-override-10">Bhakti</span> (devotion) in Discourses XII and XV of the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>, the Lord delineates in Discourse XVI the distinguishing marks of the Divine Endowment (Daivī Sampad). Hence a striver on the path of Bhakti needs must be endowed with the marks of Daivi Sampad. In <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> IX. 13-14 the Lord says of particular—</p>
<p class="Shlok">महात्मानस्तु मां पार्थ दैवीं प्रकृतिमाश्रिता:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">भजन्त्यनन्यमनसो ज्ञात्वा भूतादिमव्ययम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">सततं कीर्तयन्तो मां यतन्तश्च दृढव्रता:।</p>
<p class="Shlok">नमस्यन्तश्च मां भक्त्या नित्ययुक्ता उपासते॥</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“On the other hand, Arjuna, great souls who have embraced the divine nature, knowing Me as the (perennial) source of all lives and the imperishable eternal, worship Me constantly with none else in mind. Constantly chanting My names and glories and striving for My realization, and bowing (again and again) to Me, those devotees of firm resolve, ever united with Me (through meditation), worship Me (with single-minded devotion).”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Therefore, the striver treading the path of devotion should take note of the marks of <span class="char-style-override-10">Daivī Sampad</span> enumerated in <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> XVI.1 to 3 and try to develop such marks as may be lacking in him and persevere in his <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> without reference to its fruit.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">For him who is practising <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span> emphasis has been laid on action; of course his actions must be performed in a disinterested spirit. If this is lacking in any respect, the deficiency ought to be made up, but no wistful eye should be cast towards the fruit. Bringing home to one’s mind what has been taught in verses 40 to 71 of Discourse II and in the whole of Discourse III as well as in the synopsis of all this given in my gloss on the <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span> contained in <span class="char-style-override-10">Gītā</span>-<span class="char-style-override-10">Tattva</span> Number—I, while showing the connecting link between verses 29 and 30 of Discourse III, one should diligently pursue the discipline of <span class="char-style-override-10">Karmayoga</span>. The same remarks apply <span class="char-style-override-10">mutatis mutandis</span> to other <span class="char-style-override-10">Yogas </span>too.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">If a striver pursuing any of the aforesaid disciplines does not directly seek its reward but feels sanguine in his heart that the Lord Himself will confer its reward on him or that its fruit will come to him as a matter of course, it will be seen that such an expectant attitude, too, implies a latent craving for the fruit since the motive is already there. Hence the best thing is not to have any expectation at all. The striver should pursue his <span class="char-style-override-10">Sādhana</span> only as a matter of duty.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">The example of Prahlāda is a very sublime model for strivers on the path of devotion to emulate in the matter of disinterestedness. He remained deeply and solely absorbed in devotion to the Lord from his very childhood. One day, his father Hiraṇyakaśipu called him by his side and lovingly spoke to him as follows—“Prahlāda, my darling, reproduce to me that which is liked by you the most of what you have so far learnt from your teachers.” To this Prahlāda made the following answer—</p>
<p class="Shlok">श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णो: स्मरणं पादसेवनम्।</p>
<p class="Shlok">अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यमात्मनिवेदनम्॥</p>
<p class="Shlok">इति पुंसार्पिता विष्णौ भक्तिश्चेन्नवलक्षणा।</p>
<p class="Shlok">क्रियते भगवत्यद्धा तन्मयेऽधीतमुत्तमम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> VII. V. 23-24)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“(1) To hear the names, praises and stories of Lord Viṣṇu and (2) chant them, (3) to remember Him (as well as His names and stories), (4) to do service to Him, (5) to offer worship and (6) salutation to Him, (7) to dedicate one’s actions to Him (8) to cultivate friendship with Him and (9) to offer one’s own body as well as one’s dependants and belongings to Him—if devotion marked by these nine features is practised by a man as something already consecrated direct to Lord Viṣṇu, I reckon that (such devotion) to be the highest (form of) learning.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">Hiraṇyakaśipu flew into a rage to hear this reply of Prahlāda and exclaimed, “Take him out of the palace, O demons, and dispose him of by any means—for a veritable foe has appeared in my house in the garb of a son.” Saying so he had Prahlāda trampled by large elephants in rut, bitten by venomous serpents, hurled from mountain-tops, given poison, starved, cast into the sea, exposed to tempestuous winds, crushed under the weight of rocks and cast as fuel into a blasting fire and subjected to other such atrocious cruelties. But the demon did not succeed in killing Prahlāda by any of these devices. Prahlāda’s mind was absorbed in the thought of the Supreme Spirit, the transcendent Brahma, the Soul of the universe, that is beyond the ken of speech and mind, and the substratum of all energies. Hence all attempts on his life proved unfructuous. Although Hiraṇyakaśipu tried numerous expedients to kill Prahlāda (the details of which are given in <span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> VII. v. and <span class="char-style-override-10">Viṣṇu-Purāṇa</span> I. xvii-xviii), Prahlāda on no occasion implored the Lord either to save him or for any other object. When the Lord appeared in the form of a Man-Lion and despatched Hiraṇyakaśipu, He turned to Prahlāda and said, “Prahlāda, I am highly pleased with you. Ask of Me any boon of your choice.” Even though enticed with such tempting offers, the devotee Prahlāda, an exclusive lover of the Lord, sought no boon. On the other hand, he deemed it an obstacle in the path of devotion to solicit a boon and said—</p>
<p class="Shlok">यस्त आशिष आशास्ते न स भृत्य: स वै वणिक्।</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">   (<span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata</span> VII. x. 4)</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“He who seeks boons of You is no servant of Yours, he is only a barterer.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“I am as a matter of fact Your disinterested devotee,” continued Prahlāda, “while You are my Master having no end to achieve. Unlike the interests of a king and his servant in this world, our interest (in each other) is not governed by any other consideration. (Hence) if You would bestow on me blessings sought by me, O Chief of the bestowers of boons. I ask of You this boon alone that no more cravings may (ever) sprout in my mind.”</p>
<p class="Shlok">यदि रासीश मे कामान् वरांस्त्वं वरदर्षभ।</p>
<p class="Shlok">कामानां हृद्यसंरोहं भवतस्तु वृणे वरम्॥</p>
<p class="TXT-Right">    (<span class="char-style-override-10">śrīmad Bhāgavata VII. x. 7)</span></p>
<p class="TEXT-English">“For, with the very appearance of desire,” he went on, “the senses of perception as well as the organs of action, the mind, vital energy, the body, righteousness, firmness, understanding, modesty, affluence, glory, memory and truthfulness disappear. When (on the other hand) a man gets rid of cravings imbedded in his heart, then alone he becomes qualified for attaining the divine state.”</p>
<p class="TEXT-English">How sublime is the disinterested spirit of Prahlāda! Following the example of Prahlāda, who practised disinterested devotion to the Lord, we, too, should cultivate a highly disinterested spirit, whatever course of spiritual discipline we may be following.</p>
<p class="TEXT-English para-style-override-4">The progress in spiritual discipline gets steadily accelerated very soon in the case of a striver who pursues such a discipline in a disinterested spirit as a matter of duty without reference to its fruit, and values it more than the end itself, and speedily attains God-realization.<span></span></p>
