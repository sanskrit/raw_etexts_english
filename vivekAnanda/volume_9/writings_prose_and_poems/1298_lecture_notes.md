## LECTURE NOTES

(*New Discoveries*, Vol. 4, pp. 213-14.)

*Probably at the turn of the century, Miss Ellen Waldo gave these
undated notes in Swami Vivekananda's handwriting to her friend Sister
Devamata, a member of the Boston Vedanta Centre, where they were later
made available for publication.*

Man will need a religion so long as he is constituted as at present.  
The forms will change from time to time  
The dissatisfaction with the senses.  
The yearning beyond.  
There were encroachments of religion on the domains of physical science
— these \[encroachments\] religion is giving up every day.  
Yet there is a vast field covered by religion where physical
science\[s\] are mute.  
The \[vain?\] attempt to keep man strictly within the limits of the
senses —  
Because — there are men who catch a glimpse now and then of the infinite
beyond.  
The types of men.  
The worker — the mystic the emotional  the intellectual.  
Each type is necessary for the well — being of society. The dangers of
each —  
A mixture minimizes the danger  
The East is too full of mystics and meditative the West of workers —  
An exchange will be for the good of both.  
  
The necessity of religion —  
The four types of men  
that come to religion —  
the basis of Unity — the Divinity  
in man. Why use this term?  
the western Society has work  
and intellectual philosophy —  
But work must not be destructive  
of others.  
Philosophy — must not be only dry intellectuality
