\*∆\*∆\*∆\*

It was the time around Dīpāvalī, an year after when Somakhya and Lootika
had come to know each other. Their school had closed for the autumnal
vacation. Lootika’s mother had woken up at night due some commotion on
the street but being rather tired from the day’s labors she fell back
asleep. Her husband was out of the country for several days to attend a
conference. The next morning remembering that commotion she checked the
news before heading out to get some vegetables. She saw in the news that
the serial murderers who left a characteristic card signed Rahul and
Robert had broken into a house near theirs. The owners were not there
but a Nepali street guard had challenged them while they were in the
premises. He was injured in the encounter even as the killers had made
an escape, but not before dropping their signature card and a bludgeon,
which they evidently had wished to use in the crime. Lootika’s mother
grew rather concerned. While her husband kept a couple of illegal
revolvers she had never used them. As she was still pondering whether to
fetch the vegetables herself of take the help of the community gardener,
she got a call regarding a close relative who lived in the province to
the south of theirs. The said relative had been bitten by a cobra and
was in a serious condition in the hospital. She needed to go right away
give her kinfolk some help but under those circumstances she did not
want to leave her daughters alone in the house because she could be away
for up to 4 days irrespective of the fate of her relative. So she
decided to leave her four kids with Somakhya’s family. She
apologetically called up Somakhya’s parents and explained her situation
to them and sought permission to leave her precious brood there. Lootika
was not at all unhappy with the arrangement because it meant they had
more opportunity to discuss the stuff they were collaborating on and
generally more time to chat about things.

Accordingly their mother packed them up to drive them to Somakhya’s
house. Lootika and Vrishchika insisted on having their bikes with them,
so grudgingly she let them ride their bikes along, checking on them
repeatedly. But she absolutely forbade Varoli and Jhilleeka from taking
their cycles. Before dropping them off at Somkhya’s house she gave
Lootika a purse with cash and told her to be in charge of any needs that
might arise for her younger sisters. When they reached Somakhya’s house
they learned that Somakhya had gone with his other classmates to play a
match. Somakhya’s mother told Lootika’s mother that she had come to know
of the very existence of the serial killers only when the latter had
called. But Somakhya’s mother made it clear to the latter that
henceforth they would not be let to wander around by themselves far from
home. She also assured Lootika’s mother that they would not be allowed
to stray after taking the younger ones to their scheduled language
lessons.

That evening, though Somakhya wanted to go out again to meet his friends
Sharvamanyu and Vidrum, he was sternly instructed to stay at home with
the girls. Hence he spent his time working on the bow he was making.
After dinner Somakhya opened his home lab with his books and instruments
to the four sisters. He took his seat on a low stool at the back door of
his home lab crushing rain-tree pods to make a ball. The four sisters
were excited by Somakhya’s extensive library and started combing through
it. Lootika grabbed for herself a book titled *“The evolution of
synapsids in the Paleozoic and Triassic*”, which was so absorbing that
she seated herself cross-legged on the floor right next to the bookshelf
reading it. Jhilleeka made herself comfortable on the couch with her
tablet and a book titled “Trigonometric delights”, even as she worked
out some of the interesting results therein, occasionally consulting
Lootika and Somakhya if she got stuck. Varoli curled herself on the mat
having grabbed for herself a book titled the “Biochemistry of coenzymes”
and also an interestingly-written textbook of organic chemistry to help
her along. Vrishchika picked up a peculiar old book titled the
Kāvya-kautūhalam and was soon busy savoring its contents. She was
enamored by a verse she had just read and recited it out aloud to the
rest:

na gajā nagajā dayitā dayitā vigataṃ vigataṃ calitaṃ calitaṃ pramadā
‘pramadā mahatā mahatām araṇaṃ maraṇaṃ samayāt samayāt ||

Vrishchika: “That poem is by a rājaputra chieftain bhaṭṭi in the court
of the king śrīdharasena. While it is a low-complexity sequence we can
confer meaning on it thus:  
*The mountain-born beloved elephants were not attended to;*  
*the flight of the birds stopped and all movement disappeared;*  
*lovers were no longer loved; by the great one \[the Hanumat fire\]*  
*death* *of the great ones \[the Rakṣa-s\] arrived in due time,
\[though\] not in battle.”*

Somakhya: “What would be the biological analog such a verse?”  
Lootika: “Two adjacent nucleosomes, while otherwise identical, could
have a different biological meaning due to modification of their side
chains\!”  
Somakhya: “Good\!”  
Vrishchika: “Could you tell me more about this?”  
Lootika picked up a textbook on the biochemistry of epigenetics from
Somakhya’s collection and handed it to Vrishchika warning her: “Not all
of its contents should be taken at face value; I or Somakhya could
clarify things further once you get up to speed with the basics.”

Having started her up on that, Lootika went over to Somakhya and took a
seat on the floor beside him even as he was starting to the gather the
paste for the final act of the kanduka-kṛti. As he was doing so,
Lootika, as though induced by her relative’s fate, started talking about
snakes with Somakhya. She reminded Somakhya of the day when they were
looking for beetles and wasps at an abandoned quarry in the hills when a
cobra had dashed forth at him from its elevated lair. As Lootika yelled
out to him, Somakhya instinctively ducked and ran out of the mouth of
the quarry, even as the snake literally flew over his head with the
momentum of the attempted strike. Somakhya: “I thought that day I may
have become a sacrificial victim for the dreadful Vāsuki or Takṣaka.”

Having placed the ball to solidify, Somakhya went on to look at
microbial eukaryotes and microscopic animals under his microscope even
as the four sisters joined him. Thus, they would have spent the whole
night, had Somakhya’s parents not constantly pestered them to go to
sleep.

◊◊◊◊

The next day Somakhya and Lootika were to accompany the younger three to
Shilpika’s house for their language lessons and fetch them back.
Somakhya and Lootika had stopped attending the language lessons, so they
were sternly instructed not to wander in the hills, go to any eatery to
have snacks, or go to the woods of the university campus. The only thing
they were allowed to do was to visit the aquarium which was near
Shilpika’s house while the younger ones took their class. They nodded in
acquiescence, and left to drop off the three younger ones.

On the way Somakhya told Lootika: “If Vivasvān’s black son has to visit
us in the form of the serial killers then none of these precautions
would really help.”  
Lootika: “I agree, but given this whole atmosphere of fear if we are
caught in the surveillance of your parents elsewhere from where we are
supposed to be we could be in unnecessary trouble. By the way there are
other dangers. My friend Maurvi mentioned that there was a kidnapper on
the prowl.” Somakhya: “I have my knife. I believe that should do for the
kidnapper, given that Sharvamanyu, Vidrum and I have practiced for many
attack scenarios.”  
Lootika: “But what about me?”  
Somakhya: “We could get a knife for you from Vidrum and Sharvamanyu.
They have figured out a place to get an excellent gravity knife and we
could teach you the right defensive moves with it.”  
Lootika: “But to get the cash for that might be difficult now.”  
Somakhya: “We are planning to get ourselves Kukri-s. I could lend you
mine then.”  
Lootika: “I need to have something for me and my sisters that might be
easier to use. My father did tell me that some day he will teach me to
shoot. But I think for the immediate future we should talk more about
our other ideas for weapons; may be later tonight. As we discussed
before we should make use of the ghasa-ghasā plant or even more
spectacularly the yavaviṣa plant.”  
Somakhaya: “Lootika, you must realize that you would still need to learn
the moves and it is no joke to put them to use when being actually
attacked by someone bigger and stronger than us. But, indeed, we should
continue the weapons project. Praise be to our ancestors the Bhṛgu-s and
Āngirasa-s and the cunning of Cāṇakya. We should also continue working
on that prototype for the stun ray weapon with the new sapphire lenses.”

Thus conversing they arrived at Shilpika’s house and dropped off the
younger three. While Shilpika was scholarly, she was a boring teacher.
That was one of the main reasons that Somakhya and Lootika no longer
continued the literary lessons even though she liked them a lot and was
very good to them. That day they realized that her husband was instead
teaching the lesson. Shilpika told them that he had decided to conduct
free courses in autumn for a month by taking time off from his job as an
archaeologist and epigraphist. She mentioned that he was doing this
because he very keen to revive the Devabhāṣā as the language of the
Hindus. Lingering on, Somakhya and Lootika realized that, unlike
Shilpika, her husband was a great teacher who had a knack for making the
students immediately attentive and interested. Somakhya whispered to
Lootika that he was a man who possessed brahmavarcas and might be in
possession of brahman power. So they did a namaskāra to him. He asked
them if they might be interested to join the readings he conducted from
the samarāṅgaṇasūtradhāra, yuktikalpataru, and mānasāra. They thought
that was interesting and expressed their desire to attend the readings.

On the way back the weather was pleasant, so Lootika and Vrishchika had
Jhilleeka and Varoli sit on seats attached to the back of their
respective bikes even as they slowly walked their bikes along towards
Somakhya’s house. Just then Lootika noticed that Shilpika had sent her a
mail, with something her sister Varoli had done, adding that her sister
was just like her. Lootika showed it to Somakhya. On a piece of paper,
on one side Varoli had drawn an elephant written out the below words
under it:

sa nāgaḥ | so ‘tīva sthūlas tuṅgaś ca+āsīt | tena tulyo ‘paraḥ paśur
na+āsīt | avartanta tasya sthulāś ca kaṭhiṇāś ca ghorāś ca dantāḥ | ko
‘yaṃ nāgaḥ ?

On the other side, she had written in those same words along with the
additional words:

cakāra taraṇam arṇāyāṃ dakṣiṇa-krauñca-dvīpe | babhakṣa nakraṃ
mahāghora-rūpaṃ |

But now the earlier words were placed in a winding pattern in
compartments placed inside the body of another zoomorphic figure.

Somakhya: “Why this seems like the *Titanoboa* we used to draw in śrī
Shilpika’s sleepy class?”  
Saying so, he gave it back to Lootika. In a flash he took it back from
her, looked hard at it and continued: “What do you think is in the
serpent’s mouth?”  
Lootika: “Why that looks like the two inverted crossed ₹ symbols\! Is
that not the sign the serial killers Rahul and Robert leave behind at
the venues of their crimes?”  
Somakhya: “Yes, indeed. Ask your sister why she drew that symbol in the
serpent’s mouth.”  
With some trepidation Lootika asked Varoli who was riding in the seat
attached to Vrishchika’s bike in front of them: “Why this symbol dear
Varoli?”  
Varoli: “agrajā, I think you were the one who first showed it to me in a
news article. Then I had this dream last night where I saw the snake
with that symbol. I don’t remember anything else of that dream other
than that I awoke from it in sort of a scare but quickly fell back
asleep because you hugged me. I decided to incorporate it into my
sarpabandha after Shilpika’s husband showed us the sarpabandha-s of
Paramāra kings along with a little play on homonymy to confound the
other students.”  
Lootika: “Yes, being too sleepy I only vaguely remember that you
suddenly woke up.”

Just then Lootika got a call from Somakhya’s mother: “Where are you all?
Hurry home right away. Apparently Rahul and Robert had struck again near
your house and killed someone.” Deciding not to worry their parents and
guardians too much with such news, they quickly mounted their bikes and
sped homewards.

As they reached home they saw Somakhya’s mother standing at the gate and
to their amusement she counted them twice to make sure they were all in.
She then asked Lootika to call her mother and inform her that they were
alive and well.

◊◊◊◊

Realizing that with such news, that too in broad daylight, there was no
hope for their outdoor activities, the five filed into the home lab to
resume where they had stopped the previous night. Just then Somakhya got
a message from Sharvamanyu:  
“You might know of this girl Meghana in our class in whom our friend
Vidrum has a particular interest. I understand she was killed by the
serial killers Rahul and Robert. Thankfully Vidrum was not with her at
the time. Her body was found on the middle of the quiet Subhas Chandra
Bose Road with her skull shattered by a club, which is apparently the
trademark of these murderers.”

Somakhya showed it to Lootika. Lootika: “Now that is really scary\! That
girl was a good-for-nothing, but to be brained this way on the middle of
the road is very tragic indeed\!”

As the day proceeded they got moving with the lab and the books.
Somakhya saw a strange large non-photosynthetic euglenozoan growing in
one of his water cultures. He called Lootika over to see it and they
decided they should catch a few of them and try to get them to grow by
themselves in tube with bacterial suspension. He handed over the
microscope and a pipette to Lootika to catch them even as he proceeded
to set up a bacterial suspension. Having done completed that task they
felt good and sat down on the couch hoping their plan would work even as
they swiped through the photographs of the said protist. Suddenly,
Lootika got distracted by a message from her friend regarding the murder
of their classmate Meghana. She remarked: “How many times have we ridden
on the SCB road. Rather frightening indeed to imagine Rahul and Robert
were prowling there.”  
Somakhya: “Well they had struck on the same lane as your house the
previous night. In what way is this more frightening in that regard?”

Lootika: “Perhaps it is just beginning to sink in now.”  
Somakhya: “Talking of this, it just strikes me that there is something
strange here. Do you think this girl would have been walking in the
middle of the road? The news reports say that she was found dead on the
middle of the SCB road. If that is where she was, why did they not find
her bike or some other vehicle. If she was crossing the road then she
could have seen her assailants and would have reacted in some way, as
consequence of which they could not have killed her right in the middle
of the road.”  
Lootika: “What if they had attacked her on the footpath and she had run
to the middle of the road to avoid them?”  
Somakhya: “Possible, however note this: the assailants are supposed to
operate in a white van. Quiet as the SCB road is, if they were lying in
wait, their white van should have been parked somewhere near if they
wished to commit the crime on the footpath. The reports say that two men
on the motorbikes supposedly noticed R\&R’s trademark white van speeding
away at the end of the SCB road to enter the University road even as
they entered the road in the opposite direction and saw the corpse. That
does not seem to square with the report saying that none of the
residents saw or heard anything: her screams, noises of the girl being
clobbered, or the white van being parked for a substantial time on their
parking spaces.”

Varoli who was nearby remarked: “Now that you say all this, I remember
little more of my dream. I think I saw someone being chased by two men
in a lonely place. She tripped and fell and they struck her with hunting
crops. I think that’s when I woke up in a fright.”

Just as they were taking in Varoli’s curious statement, Vrishchika
chimed in sounding rather shaken: “Well, we are not going to be seeing
two of our schoolmates when school resumes…”  
Lootika: “What do you mean\!”  
Vrishchika: “I just got a message from my friend that my classmate Vikas
died today. Apparently, he had unwrapped a large number of those
‘atom-bombs’ which come wound in a green rope and collected the
explosive to make a big one. He put the stuff in a tin, inserted a
magnesium wire into it, and set it alight. Before he could run it
apparently went off straight on his face and he succumbed to his injury
today.”

Somakhya: “Ouch, what a sad way to go\! That is one experiment which
should be done with utmost caution; not at all something for the casual
pyrotechnic enthusiast. The poor boy should have really listened to the
warnings of the elders for that one.”

For some time they remained silent, each turning in their mind how close
Vaivasvata could be. Finally, perhaps to articulate her sense of
disquiet little Jhilleeka broke the somber stillness: “Ain’t it strange
that Varoli had a such a prognostic dream? Aren’t dreams supposed to
recapitulate past events rather than prognosticate future ones?”  
Lootika: “Dear antajā, I don’t think Varoli’s dream was prognostic. See
she was already primed by the fact that R\&R had struck near our house.
Then there was the snake looming large on our minds. She already knew
from the reports that R\&R had dispatched their victims by slugging them
on the head and I had shown her the article which showed the symbol they
left behind. So all that congealed into her dream. Moreover she
remembered this only post-facto; so how can we even be sure that her
recall was perfect. We tend to see patterns, so we think it was
prognostic. After all no one dreamed of Vrishchika’s classmate
detonating his own face.”

Varoli: “But then you surely recall that August Kekule von Stradonitz
discovered the aromatic ring structure of benzene in his dream. Would
this not fit the bill as being prognostic? After all this is one
discovery on which we peg much of what we do even today.”

Vrishchika: “Lootika, in the same vein I am sure you also remember the
studies which have shown that rats dream of futures movements in locales
that they have not been able to actually explore. That is in a sense a
prognostic pre-view in a dream. So when we put all those things together
we can arrive at something close to being a real prognosis.”

Somakhya asked Varoli to pass him her drawing of the sarpabandha, which
was related to the on going discussion amongst the sisters. Having
closely looked at it and then checking out a map on his computer he
returned it to Varoli remarking: “I suspect that Meghana was not killed
on the middle of the SCB road but was rather clubbed to death at the
Manorañjanodyānam near Vidrum’s house.”

Lootika: “Why do you say so?”  
Somakhya: “Well, all I will say for now is that if it proves to be right
then Varoli’s dream was genuinely prognostic.”

◊◊◊◊

Lootika’s mother came back a couple of days later after having helped
her relative who had survived but for the loss of a couple of toes. She
headed straight to collect her daughters from Somakhya’s home and
returned home. With Rahul and Robert claiming further victims, Lootika
and Somakhya never got to meet again that vacation except for the day
when their families had assembled together at the hilltop shrine of the
god Kumāra for a major triannual festival. But they did not get to talk
much that day as they were totally taken in by the bustle of the ritual.
However, Somakhya managed get the large euglenozoan growing but to his
disappointment he could not get it over to Lootika to do her molecular
biological wizardry for them to proceed ahead. As he was ruing this on
the last day of the vacation, he received a message from her:  
“Hey, I just heard from Maurvi and Nikhila that there is a shootout
going on outside the gym near school.”

Somakhya checked the news and confirmed that something like that was
indeed underway. He hoped that this might lead to school being closed
for at least one more day. But his hopes were dashed as he got a message
from Vidrum: “The situation has resolved in the most unbelievably
dramatic fashion. Apparently, Awrangzeb Khan and Sher Khan, the suspects
in the mall bombing that took place last year had a brush with none
other than Rahul and Robert outside the gym. In the ensuring skirmish
Awrangzeb Khan was killed and the remaining three were seriously
injured. Consequently, they were unable to flee and have been taken into
custody.”

◊◊◊◊

It was many years after these incidents. Lootika was in the last
semester of her college and Vrishchika deep in med-school. At the end of
the day Lootika had gone over to the medical campus to pick up
Vrishchika since she had given her bike for servicing. There she saw
Vrishchika waiting for her along her former classmates Vidrum and
Gardabh and Vrishchika’s classmate Mahish. Since they were seeing
Lootika after a long time they paused to chat a little.

Gardabh: “What are you guys doing for the commute tomorrow? Do you think
it might be better to take the train or bus?”  
Mahish: “What is the matter?”  
Gardabh: “Did you not hear that Sher Khan is going to be hanged?”  
Mahish: “Who on earth is this Sher Khan and why are they hanging him?”  
Vidrum: “Don’t tell me you don’t know who Sher Khan is. He was the brain
behind the mall-bombing when we were kids.”  
Mahish: “I really don’t bother about all this politics. It is so boring
and as it is there is so much to study with exams round the corner. I
seriously want to become a doctor. ”  
Gardabh: “But then this could be a life and death issue; especially if
the two communities decide to clash. That is why I say we must be more
enlightened like Europe and abolish this death punishment.”  
Vidrum: “What nonsense. I would say let us not just hang Sher Khan but
also Rahul and Robert. They are no less deserving of this.”  
Vrishchika: “I am sure you have seen the news that the church of the
baptists is working hard to get Robert’s sentence commuted right
away.”  
Gardabh: “Now why are you bringing religion into all this. That is why
we could be caught in riots tomorrow.”  
Lootika: “Hey Gardabh – you are the guy who procured me the knife that I
am still carrying with me. Now why are you getting worried about
riots.”  
Gardabh: “See Lootika those were old days. I am not into all this
anymore. Like Mahish says I am serious about becoming a doctor.”  
Vidrum: “So you think I am not?”

Gardabh: “No, No. I am just trying to bring sense to you guys. Killing
the killer does not right the wrong. Yes they were a danger to society;
let us keep them in jail so that they can never cause trouble to us
again. Now by killing them we are only worsening the communal divide.
Also think about this Rahul and Robert were young and misguided. They
confessed that they thought killing people was like hunting tigers on a
safari, just more exciting. If they lived in a humane society they would
not think like this. So jail has to be corrective experience for them
not just punitive. By executing them the government is being given power
to do the very thing they are being punished for. Moreover, R\&R killed
Awrangzeb Khan. So have the not also contributed to fighting terrorism?
Now look at Sher Khan. He has a young daughter who might one day be a
student like us. Should we not have compassion?”  
Vrishchika: “Well I am not exactly waiting with bated breath for that.
If she gets to see anything beyond the haze of her veil that would
achievement enough\! I agree with Vidrum all three of them should be put
to death forthwith.”  
Mahish: “Friends, I am sure there are so many such cases all over the
country. Why waste our energy arguing over all this useless stuff. We
could have talked about those difficult questions on resistance to
beta-lactams that I am not making any sense of.”

Vidrum: “Lootika, you don’t have an opinion?”  
Lootika: “I do but not that it would matter much to the world.”  
Gardabh: “Let’s hear it anyhow.”  
Lootika: “I think Sher Khan should not be hanged because he becoming a
martyr would only further the marūnmāda meme-complex. Instead he should
be subject to such treatment so that he repeatedly confesses that
marūnmāda is utter nonsense, that he has given it up, and that all
marūnmatta-s should give it up. These statements should then be widely
broadcast for both the Hindus and marūnmatta-s to see and hear. If you
think that it is impossible, we hear that a Japanese lord made it happen
to the pretasādhakas in the past, and we have had Bhāgurāyaṇa. As for
R\&R I think they should be given the mṛtyu-daṇḍa and not waste the
tax-payer’s money. And Vidrum I do hope you get your closure with
R\&R.”  
Gardabh: “All that will never happen. You are just being a cruel girl.”

Vidrum: “I have already got it: even if not total, it is a liberating
closure. I doubt you have seen the details that came out during these
cases. Apparently Meghana was waiting for none other Sher Khan’s junior
partner Awrangzeb Khan at the sitting area in the Manorañjanodyānam.
That was when R\&R clobbered her and then threw her corpse out of their
van on the middle of the SCB road. R\&R’s skirmish with the marūnmatta-s
was apparently precipitated by this.”

Lootika: “Vrishchika, did you hear that\! Let’s be going.”  
Vrishchika: “Vow\! We must stop at Somakhya’s house on the way home\!”

◊◊◊◊

Somakhya: “Gautamī-s, look at this; your sister’s old drawing and the
udyāna’s walk way. What would you say pareidolia or prognosis?”

Lootika: “Unbelievable.”  
Vrishchika: “And the biological equivalent of that would be
recombination of transposons on chromosome.”
