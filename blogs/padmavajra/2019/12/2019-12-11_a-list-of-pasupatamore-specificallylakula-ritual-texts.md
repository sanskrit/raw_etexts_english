A lot of Pāśupata Śāstras existed(apart from the famous sutra) which had
the suffix -pramāṇa. The Pramāṇas dealing with ritual were formulated by
Musalendra based on the Hṛdayapramāṇa.They are:

(1)Purakalpapramāṇa  
(2)Kanakapramāṇa  
(3)Śālapramāṇa  
(4)Niruttarapramāṇa  
(5)Viśvapramāṇa  
(6)Prapañcapramāṇa

The Hṛdayapramāṇa itself was a part of a set of ‘pramāṇa’śastras,and
this second set was concerned with gnosis(and not ritual) and were
deemed to be superior śāstras. They were:

(1)Pañcārtha pramāṇa  
(2)Guhya pramāṇa  
(3)Rudrāṅkuśa pramāṇa  
(4)Hṛdaya pramāṇa  
(5)Lakṣaṇa pramāṇa  
(6)Vyūha pramāṇa  
(7)Ākarṣa pramāṇa  
(8)Ādarśa pramāṇa

This listing of Pāśupata śāstras is done by Kṣemarāja who notes the
various Rudras who take on the names of these śāstras.
