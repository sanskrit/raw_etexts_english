## LXXXV

LAHORE,  
*16th October, 1898*.

YOUR HIGHNESS, (Maharaja of Khetri.)

The letter that followed my wire gave the desired information; therefore
I did not wire back about my health in reply to yours.

This year I suffered much in Kashmir and am now recovered and going to
Calcutta direct today. For the last ten years or so I have not seen the
Puja of Shri Durgâ in Bengal which is the great affair there. I hope
this year to be present.

The Western friends will come to see Jaipur in a week or two. If
Jagamohan be there, kindly instruct him to pay some attention to them
and show them over the city and the old arts.

I leave instructions with my brother Saradananda to write to Munshiji
before they start for Jaipur.

How are you and the Prince? Ever as usual praying for your welfare,

I remain yours affectionately,

VIVEKANANDA.

PS. My future address is Math, Belur, Howrah Dist. Bengal.
